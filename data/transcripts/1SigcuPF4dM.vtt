36 and I also serve as a chairman of the
 
00:11:49.509 --> 00:11:49.519 align:start position:0%
house Municipal and County government
 
00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:52.480 align:start position:0%
committee House Bill 200 was filed upon
 
00:11:55.509 --> 00:11:55.519 align:start position:0%
the request of a number of our
 
00:11:58.470 --> 00:11:58.480 align:start position:0%
constituents across the state New
 
00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:01.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law allows a political
 
00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:03.040 align:start position:0%
subdivision of the state whose
 
00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:05.600 align:start position:0%
legislative body raises and appropriates
 
00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:08.800 align:start position:0%
funds through an annual meeting to adopt
 
00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:12.800 align:start position:0%
a local tax cap and this is under RSA 32
 
00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:14.509 align:start position:0%
a local tax cap and this is under RSA 32
colon

00:12:14.509 --> 00:12:14.519 align:start position:0%
colon
 
00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:18.560 align:start position:0%
5-c a 35ths majority is required to
 
00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
adopt a local tax cap under current law
 
00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:24.880 align:start position:0%
the legislative body can override a
 
00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
local tax cap by a simple
 
00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:31.040 align:start position:0%
majority therefore a local tax cap is
 
00:12:34.509 --> 00:12:34.519 align:start position:0%
simply a maximum starting point for the
 
00:12:37.069 --> 00:12:37.079 align:start position:0%
tax effort which a governing body or an
 
00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:39.680 align:start position:0%
official budget committee can bring
 
00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:42.320 align:start position:0%
forward at an annual meeting for all
 
00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:45.800 align:start position:0%
warrant articles that have a tax
 
00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:48.760 align:start position:0%
impact the tax effort is the total
 
00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:52.240 align:start position:0%
Appropriations minus the total estimated
 
00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
revenues in other words under current
 
00:12:59.590 --> 00:12:59.600 align:start position:0%
RSA a local tax cap simply limits the
 
00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:02.120 align:start position:0%
total proposed tax
 
00:13:04.949 --> 00:13:04.959 align:start position:0%
effort because the legislative body can
 
00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:09.160 align:start position:0%
override this by a simple majority vote
 
00:13:13.069 --> 00:13:13.079 align:start position:0%
so this bill is very simple it modifies
 
00:13:16.389 --> 00:13:16.399 align:start position:0%
the vote threshold from a simple
 
00:13:19.509 --> 00:13:19.519 align:start position:0%
majority to a three-fifths majority in
 
00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:23.440 align:start position:0%
order to override a tax cap since the
 
00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:27.160 align:start position:0%
purpose of a tax cap is to ensure fiscal
 
00:13:30.509 --> 00:13:30.519 align:start position:0%
responsibility and prudence in budgeting
 
00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:33.040 align:start position:0%
it is reasonable that any proposed
 
00:13:36.629 --> 00:13:36.639 align:start position:0%
spending that causes the tax effort to
 
00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:40.880 align:start position:0%
exceed the tax cap should in fact have a
 
00:13:43.949 --> 00:13:43.959 align:start position:0%
higher standard to override than just a
 
00:13:43.959 --> 00:13:45.150 align:start position:0%
higher standard to override than just a
simple

00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:45.160 align:start position:0%
simple
 
00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:48.240 align:start position:0%
majority due to the fact that a tax cap
 
00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:53.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:56.069 --> 00:13:56.079 align:start position:0%
majority and also
 
00:14:00.269 --> 00:14:00.279 align:start position:0%
requiring a requiring a 3- fths majority
 
00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:03.880 align:start position:0%
to override it ensures that any spending
 
00:14:06.990 --> 00:14:07.000 align:start position:0%
that exceeds the tax cap is in fact
 
00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:10.600 align:start position:0%
supported by a super majority of Voters
 
00:14:13.389 --> 00:14:13.399 align:start position:0%
we can all agree that increased local
 
00:14:16.269 --> 00:14:16.279 align:start position:0%
property taxes is a major concern for
 
00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:21.000 align:start position:0%
our constituents across the state and
 
00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
this is our increasing taxes is due to
 
00:14:27.069 --> 00:14:27.079 align:start position:0%
increase both Municipal and school
 
00:14:30.069 --> 00:14:30.079 align:start position:0%
spending at the local level
 
00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:32.720 align:start position:0%
therefore since overriding a tax cap
 
00:14:36.069 --> 00:14:36.079 align:start position:0%
will increase the local tax effort which
 
00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:38.560 align:start position:0%
of course results in increased local
 
00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:40.509 align:start position:0%
of course results in increased local
property

00:14:40.509 --> 00:14:40.519 align:start position:0%
property
 
00:14:44.189 --> 00:14:44.199 align:start position:0%
taxes it is reasonable to require a
 
00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:46.360 align:start position:0%
higher bar to override
 
00:14:49.069 --> 00:14:49.079 align:start position:0%
it additionally I'd like to note that a
 
00:14:51.629 --> 00:14:51.639 align:start position:0%
higher bar of a three-fifths majority is
 
00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:55.160 align:start position:0%
required for bonds notes and multi-year
 
00:14:57.310 --> 00:14:57.320 align:start position:0%
Lease agreements without an escape
 
00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
Clause due to the extra extraordinary
 
00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:02.360 align:start position:0%
Financial commitment that comes with
 
00:15:03.949 --> 00:15:03.959 align:start position:0%
these types of
 
00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:07.120 align:start position:0%
expenditures to be clear any increase
 
00:15:10.030 --> 00:15:10.040 align:start position:0%
spending that overrides a local tax cap
 
00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
is is similar to such an extraordinary
 
00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:16.720 align:start position:0%
Financial commitment for the taxpayers
 
00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:18.110 align:start position:0%
Financial commitment for the taxpayers
and

00:15:18.110 --> 00:15:18.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:15:20.910 --> 00:15:20.920 align:start position:0%
therefore the co-sponsors believe that
 
00:15:24.069 --> 00:15:24.079 align:start position:0%
this should also require a 35ths
 
00:15:24.079 --> 00:15:25.550 align:start position:0%
this should also require a 35ths
majority

00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:25.560 align:start position:0%
majority
 
00:15:28.389 --> 00:15:28.399 align:start position:0%
vote I'd also like to point out that the
 
00:15:30.990 --> 00:15:31.000 align:start position:0%
provisions of this bill in front of you
 
00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:33.880 align:start position:0%
are very similar to the provisions of
 
00:15:38.590 --> 00:15:38.600 align:start position:0%
2021 Senate Bill 52 which is now law
 
00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:41.120 align:start position:0%
this law requires a super majority vote
 
00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:43.720 align:start position:0%
for City Charter exclusions and
 
00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:46.720 align:start position:0%
ordinances that have the effect of a tax
 
00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:50.480 align:start position:0%
cap override since City C tax caps have
 
00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:53.440 align:start position:0%
a super majority override requirement it
 
00:15:56.470 --> 00:15:56.480 align:start position:0%
only makes sense for towns Village and
 
00:15:59.629 --> 00:15:59.639 align:start position:0%
School District tax caps to similarly
 
00:16:03.470 --> 00:16:03.480 align:start position:0%
also have a super majority override
 
00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:06.880 align:start position:0%
requirement thus this bill House Bill
 
00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:09.880 align:start position:0%
200 would align all other political
 
00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:12.720 align:start position:0%
subdivisions with cities regarding
 
00:16:15.309 --> 00:16:15.319 align:start position:0%
overriding a tax cap so that our laws
 
00:16:19.269 --> 00:16:19.279 align:start position:0%
are consistent across the state also
 
00:16:22.069 --> 00:16:22.079 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 200 outlines that when a
 
00:16:24.990 --> 00:16:25.000 align:start position:0%
proposed appropriation will exceed the
 
00:16:28.350 --> 00:16:28.360 align:start position:0%
tax cap voting on the question shall be
 
00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:29.880 align:start position:0%
by ballot
 
00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:32.240 align:start position:0%
and lastly it's important to note that
 
00:16:35.230 --> 00:16:35.240 align:start position:0%
this bill in no way limits the
 
00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:38.120 align:start position:0%
legislative body's authority to either
 
00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
increase or decrease the amount of any
 
00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:42.189 align:start position:0%
increase or decrease the amount of any
single

00:16:42.189 --> 00:16:42.199 align:start position:0%
single
 
00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:46.240 align:start position:0%
appropriation or the total amount of all
 
00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:48.920 align:start position:0%
Appropriations to conclude I urge that
 
00:16:52.509 --> 00:16:52.519 align:start position:0%
the committee recommend House Bill 200
 
00:16:55.230 --> 00:16:55.240 align:start position:0%
ought to pass with Amendment thank you
 
00:16:57.949 --> 00:16:57.959 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman that concludes my bill
 
00:16:57.959 --> 00:16:59.389 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman that concludes my bill
introduction

00:16:59.389 --> 00:16:59.399 align:start position:0%
introduction
 
00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:01.480 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to answer any
 
00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:03.920 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative power
 
00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:09.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:11.549 --> 00:17:11.559 align:start position:0%
representative R
 
00:17:14.189 --> 00:17:14.199 align:start position:0%
gri thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:17:16.309 --> 00:17:16.319 align:start position:0%
taking my question can you just
 
00:17:19.309 --> 00:17:19.319 align:start position:0%
clarify um the last section B where on
 
00:17:24.110 --> 00:17:24.120 align:start position:0%
line 20 down um on the assigned portion
 
00:17:25.549 --> 00:17:25.559 align:start position:0%
when it goes into the assigned portion
 
00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:27.520 align:start position:0%
of the adjusted sa shall be assumed and
 
00:17:29.230 --> 00:17:29.240 align:start position:0%
raised as appropriate can you just
 
00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:31.520 align:start position:0%
explain that a bit further thank you for
 
00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
the question so in the amendment um that
 
00:17:38.789 --> 00:17:38.799 align:start position:0%
change it eliminates simply eliminates a
 
00:17:42.990 --> 00:17:43.000 align:start position:0%
reference in the bill that was filed to
 
00:17:47.669 --> 00:17:47.679 align:start position:0%
194c due to the fact that there's um
 
00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:50.520 align:start position:0%
that's not the only way to have an SAU
 
00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:53.160 align:start position:0%
budget warrant article school districts
 
00:17:55.669 --> 00:17:55.679 align:start position:0%
can optionally have an SAU budget
 
00:17:58.350 --> 00:17:58.360 align:start position:0%
warrant article so that's why that was
 
00:17:58.360 --> 00:17:59.510 align:start position:0%
warrant article so that's why that was
amended

00:17:59.510 --> 00:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
amended
 
00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:03.029 align:start position:0%
amended
as

00:18:03.029 --> 00:18:03.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:05.909 --> 00:18:05.919 align:start position:0%
such any other
 
00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:09.240 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative thank
 
00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:13.000 align:start position:0%
you like to Now call uh excuse me rep uh
 
00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:26.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:29.200 align:start position:0%
Association thank you uh Mr B chairman
 
00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:30.320 align:start position:0%
and thank you to the committee for the
 
00:18:32.350 --> 00:18:32.360 align:start position:0%
record my name is Brody Dees I represent
 
00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:34.240 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Municipal Association
 
00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
and we are currently opposed to the bill
 
00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:38.600 align:start position:0%
as introduced I haven't seen the
 
00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:40.000 align:start position:0%
amendment so I can't speak to that but
 
00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:42.320 align:start position:0%
I'll speak to the um what is the current
 
00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:45.480 align:start position:0%
underlying bill um House Bill 200 uh
 
00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:47.600 align:start position:0%
requires a tax cap override by the
 
00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:49.720 align:start position:0%
legislative body to be done by ballot
 
00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
even at traditional Town meetings and
 
00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:53.200 align:start position:0%
the balloting will be done by a secret
 
00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:55.360 align:start position:0%
yes or no ballot it also mandates that
 
00:18:57.310 --> 00:18:57.320 align:start position:0%
SP SP2 municipalities and traditional
 
00:18:59.149 --> 00:18:59.159 align:start position:0%
Town meetings must vote in a
 
00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:01.080 align:start position:0%
three-fifths majority to override the
 
00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:03.000 align:start position:0%
tax cap rather than the existing
 
00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
majority vote um the decision whether to
 
00:19:07.390 --> 00:19:07.400 align:start position:0%
appropriate more than the tax cap
 
00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:09.200 align:start position:0%
belongs to the voters so this curbs
 
00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:11.080 align:start position:0%
existing voter Authority and majority
 
00:19:14.669 --> 00:19:14.679 align:start position:0%
rule by requiring a th higher threshold
 
00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:16.440 align:start position:0%
um there's a separate Senate Bill I'd
 
00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:17.400 align:start position:0%
like to point out that allows
 
00:19:20.149 --> 00:19:20.159 align:start position:0%
municipalities to adopt a local option
 
00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
tax cap that would have a
 
00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:27.280 align:start position:0%
35 um option of overriding tax caps um
 
00:19:29.310 --> 00:19:29.320 align:start position:0%
this overrides house buil 200 would
 
00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:31.240 align:start position:0%
override the existing Provisions for tax
 
00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
cap overrides and municipalities which
 
00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:34.400 align:start position:0%
means the bill overrules the decisions
 
00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:36.280 align:start position:0%
made by the legislative bodies the
 
00:19:38.990 --> 00:19:39.000 align:start position:0%
voters any municipality with an existing
 
00:19:40.549 --> 00:19:40.559 align:start position:0%
tax cap would automatically have to
 
00:19:42.990 --> 00:19:43.000 align:start position:0%
implement this new override provision uh
 
00:19:45.070 --> 00:19:45.080 align:start position:0%
with no revote requirement usually when
 
00:19:48.070 --> 00:19:48.080 align:start position:0%
you introduce um sorry usually it's been
 
00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
historic in Hampshire that when new
 
00:19:52.669 --> 00:19:52.679 align:start position:0%
provisions of law for whether tax cap
 
00:19:53.870 --> 00:19:53.880 align:start position:0%
overrides or other things that will
 
00:19:56.310 --> 00:19:56.320 align:start position:0%
impact the budget process um that you
 
00:19:57.789 --> 00:19:57.799 align:start position:0%
have some kind of voter adoption
 
00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:00.240 align:start position:0%
procedure especially for tax caps notice
 
00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:03.280 align:start position:0%
most of our tax caps in RSA 32 have some
 
00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:05.480 align:start position:0%
kind of provision for voters to adopt um
 
00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
the specific sections of it or to choose
 
00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:10.440 align:start position:0%
which tax cap that uh is best for their
 
00:20:12.669 --> 00:20:12.679 align:start position:0%
municipality um we believe that this
 
00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:14.080 align:start position:0%
would be detrimental to the voters and
 
00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:15.760 align:start position:0%
local control because of that reason
 
00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:18.320 align:start position:0%
that by mandating um one type of
 
00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
override um in in this specific set of
 
00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:23.200 align:start position:0%
statutes that um that the voters have
 
00:20:25.470 --> 00:20:25.480 align:start position:0%
lost control over how exactly they want
 
00:20:28.909 --> 00:20:28.919 align:start position:0%
their budget process to to operate um I
 
00:20:30.909 --> 00:20:30.919 align:start position:0%
also want to include that it includes
 
00:20:33.390 --> 00:20:33.400 align:start position:0%
the firste cost of unapproved bonded or
 
00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:35.120 align:start position:0%
multi-year warrant articles in the tax
 
00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:38.360 align:start position:0%
cap calculation um under uh Roman 3
 
00:20:40.390 --> 00:20:40.400 align:start position:0%
subsection a of the bill um which would
 
00:20:43.870 --> 00:20:43.880 align:start position:0%
be a change and um and this also changes
 
00:20:45.789 --> 00:20:45.799 align:start position:0%
kind of the concept of what is proposed
 
00:20:47.909 --> 00:20:47.919 align:start position:0%
to the legislative body versus what the
 
00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:49.760 align:start position:0%
legislative body has approved so
 
00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
currently as um as was previously
 
00:20:55.350 --> 00:20:55.360 align:start position:0%
mentioned um the tax cap is essentially
 
00:20:57.110 --> 00:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
what the governing body you know a
 
00:20:59.070 --> 00:20:59.080 align:start position:0%
limitation on what they post to the
 
00:21:01.789 --> 00:21:01.799 align:start position:0%
legislative body um this would add a
 
00:21:03.710 --> 00:21:03.720 align:start position:0%
further restriction on the legislative
 
00:21:05.909 --> 00:21:05.919 align:start position:0%
body to determine how much it wants to
 
00:21:08.270 --> 00:21:08.280 align:start position:0%
raise an appropriate in taxes either
 
00:21:10.470 --> 00:21:10.480 align:start position:0%
more less the same amount as a governing
 
00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:13.080 align:start position:0%
body and um we believe that the ultimate
 
00:21:15.669 --> 00:21:15.679 align:start position:0%
um will of the voters should be left to
 
00:21:17.909 --> 00:21:17.919 align:start position:0%
the legislative body and that majority
 
00:21:20.149 --> 00:21:20.159 align:start position:0%
rule um should be what determines how
 
00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:23.360 align:start position:0%
much is raised and appropriated in uh in
 
00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:26.120 align:start position:0%
in municipalities budgets um and with
 
00:21:30.190 --> 00:21:30.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:32.909 --> 00:21:32.919 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr Dees uh any questions uh
 
00:21:35.269 --> 00:21:35.279 align:start position:0%
representative Dolan please thank you Mr
 
00:21:39.029 --> 00:21:39.039 align:start position:0%
Vice chair I I have a process question
 
00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:42.760 align:start position:0%
yep if if at the annual
 
00:21:46.789 --> 00:21:46.799 align:start position:0%
meeting uh the voters are approving
 
00:21:49.549 --> 00:21:49.559 align:start position:0%
different changes amendments or
 
00:21:52.789 --> 00:21:52.799 align:start position:0%
whatever but individual amendments don't
 
00:21:57.870 --> 00:21:57.880 align:start position:0%
add enough to the budget to uh to exceed
 
00:22:00.350 --> 00:22:00.360 align:start position:0%
the tax cap that they may have
 
00:22:03.029 --> 00:22:03.039 align:start position:0%
previously agreed on at what point and
 
00:22:09.669 --> 00:22:09.679 align:start position:0%
as there as the as the uh Community is
 
00:22:11.870 --> 00:22:11.880 align:start position:0%
adding the scenario I'm thinking of is
 
00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:14.760 align:start position:0%
they're adding elements P you know
 
00:22:19.630 --> 00:22:19.640 align:start position:0%
pieces of of the government
 
00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:22.240 align:start position:0%
expenditures uh and and then at some
 
00:22:24.669 --> 00:22:24.679 align:start position:0%
point you might
 
00:22:28.190 --> 00:22:28.200 align:start position:0%
trigger exceeding the tax cap uh let's
 
00:22:29.909 --> 00:22:29.919 align:start position:0%
let's say say there there are five
 
00:22:32.430 --> 00:22:32.440 align:start position:0%
amendments and it it isn't until you get
 
00:22:33.909 --> 00:22:33.919 align:start position:0%
to the fifth amendment that all of a
 
00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:35.840 align:start position:0%
sudden you've just triggered the
 
00:22:39.070 --> 00:22:39.080 align:start position:0%
percentage maximum in the tax cap H how
 
00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:41.120 align:start position:0%
does that work I mean do do you have to
 
00:22:45.029 --> 00:22:45.039 align:start position:0%
go back and negate every amendment that
 
00:22:47.269 --> 00:22:47.279 align:start position:0%
that contributed to that excess amount
 
00:22:49.230 --> 00:22:49.240 align:start position:0%
of spending or do is it only the one
 
00:22:52.029 --> 00:22:52.039 align:start position:0%
that triggers the excess so at a
 
00:22:53.789 --> 00:22:53.799 align:start position:0%
traditional town meeting under current
 
00:22:56.390 --> 00:22:56.400 align:start position:0%
law um the voters once so the governing
 
00:23:00.149 --> 00:23:00.159 align:start position:0%
body they're the ones who are inhibited
 
00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:02.640 align:start position:0%
from proposing a budget that exceeds the
 
00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:05.440 align:start position:0%
tax cap calculation depending on what um
 
00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:06.840 align:start position:0%
what parts of the state law you're
 
00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:08.480 align:start position:0%
operating under and what type of tax cap
 
00:23:10.710 --> 00:23:10.720 align:start position:0%
you've adopted their job you know their
 
00:23:12.430 --> 00:23:12.440 align:start position:0%
responsibility what they're Bound by law
 
00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:14.240 align:start position:0%
to do if they've adopted tax cap
 
00:23:17.070 --> 00:23:17.080 align:start position:0%
Provisions in their uh municipality is
 
00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:20.400 align:start position:0%
to introduce a budget that um meets
 
00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:23.200 align:start position:0%
those um that meets the the requirements
 
00:23:25.710 --> 00:23:25.720 align:start position:0%
of the tax cap in their municipality the
 
00:23:28.470 --> 00:23:28.480 align:start position:0%
legislative body currently it can DEC
 
00:23:29.870 --> 00:23:29.880 align:start position:0%
increase the budget by as much as it
 
00:23:31.909 --> 00:23:31.919 align:start position:0%
wants it can increase the budget by as
 
00:23:33.390 --> 00:23:33.400 align:start position:0%
much as it wants it's ultimately the
 
00:23:34.990 --> 00:23:35.000 align:start position:0%
will of the voters and especially at a
 
00:23:36.830 --> 00:23:36.840 align:start position:0%
traditional town meeting they can't
 
00:23:38.669 --> 00:23:38.679 align:start position:0%
leave until they've approved the budget
 
00:23:41.390 --> 00:23:41.400 align:start position:0%
now at s SP2 town There's a deliberative
 
00:23:43.110 --> 00:23:43.120 align:start position:0%
session so the first session of the town
 
00:23:45.269 --> 00:23:45.279 align:start position:0%
meeting and yes they're allowed to amend
 
00:23:47.549 --> 00:23:47.559 align:start position:0%
the budget to surpass the amount of the
 
00:23:50.110 --> 00:23:50.120 align:start position:0%
tax cap to decrease it um ultimately
 
00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
once the budget's with the legislative
 
00:23:55.029 --> 00:23:55.039 align:start position:0%
body um you just need a majority to pass
 
00:23:57.269 --> 00:23:57.279 align:start position:0%
the budget and an SP2 you know after the
 
00:23:58.669 --> 00:23:58.679 align:start position:0%
deliberative session and the budget has
 
00:24:00.269 --> 00:24:00.279 align:start position:0%
been amended it's presented to the
 
00:24:02.070 --> 00:24:02.080 align:start position:0%
voters and the voters can say yes to
 
00:24:03.510 --> 00:24:03.520 align:start position:0%
that budget that was amended at the
 
00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
deliberative session or no and if they
 
00:24:07.149 --> 00:24:07.159 align:start position:0%
say no there's a default budget
 
00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:09.200 align:start position:0%
calculations that's um that's you know
 
00:24:11.830 --> 00:24:11.840 align:start position:0%
in state law and RSA 40 I want to say
 
00:24:15.710 --> 00:24:15.720 align:start position:0%
colon 13 or 14 So currently it's the tax
 
00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:18.240 align:start position:0%
cap Provisions are a requirement of the
 
00:24:20.510 --> 00:24:20.520 align:start position:0%
government governing body representative
 
00:24:22.549 --> 00:24:22.559 align:start position:0%
but not a requirement placed upon the
 
00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
legislative body because they're the
 
00:24:25.950 --> 00:24:25.960 align:start position:0%
voters and ultimately the taxpayers who
 
00:24:28.789 --> 00:24:28.799 align:start position:0%
will have to um who will have you know
 
00:24:30.149 --> 00:24:30.159 align:start position:0%
determine how much they want to have
 
00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:31.440 align:start position:0%
raised in appropriated in their
 
00:24:33.430 --> 00:24:33.440 align:start position:0%
municipalities and how much taxes they
 
00:24:36.510 --> 00:24:36.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:40.029 --> 00:24:40.039 align:start position:0%
thereof followup rep Dolan thank you uh
 
00:24:43.990 --> 00:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
so at the town meeting the go the
 
00:24:47.630 --> 00:24:47.640 align:start position:0%
members of the of the uh legislative
 
00:24:51.710 --> 00:24:51.720 align:start position:0%
body uh the Govern governing body is
 
00:24:56.269 --> 00:24:56.279 align:start position:0%
present and if if are they limited under
 
00:24:58.669 --> 00:24:58.679 align:start position:0%
this under these Provisions to make
 
00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:03.120 align:start position:0%
amendments to the budget uh to increase
 
00:25:06.350 --> 00:25:06.360 align:start position:0%
the the budget I mean uh members of the
 
00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:08.760 align:start position:0%
governing body who are present they can
 
00:25:10.510 --> 00:25:10.520 align:start position:0%
raise their hand and get the attention
 
00:25:12.789 --> 00:25:12.799 align:start position:0%
of the moderator and say I I want to
 
00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:15.760 align:start position:0%
amend the budget increase it by X perc
 
00:25:18.190 --> 00:25:18.200 align:start position:0%
or x amount of dollars are they limited
 
00:25:20.430 --> 00:25:20.440 align:start position:0%
by this at all or or are they just
 
00:25:22.470 --> 00:25:22.480 align:start position:0%
another member of the legislative body
 
00:25:24.070 --> 00:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
are you saying specifically under this
 
00:25:27.669 --> 00:25:27.679 align:start position:0%
Bill yes um so the way we interpret the
 
00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:28.840 align:start position:0%
way we understand in this bill is
 
00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:30.720 align:start position:0%
they're not prohibited from amending the
 
00:25:33.549 --> 00:25:33.559 align:start position:0%
budget but if they as you mentioned if
 
00:25:35.470 --> 00:25:35.480 align:start position:0%
they amend the budget and they surpass
 
00:25:37.950 --> 00:25:37.960 align:start position:0%
that tax cap threshold in order to pass
 
00:25:40.230 --> 00:25:40.240 align:start position:0%
the budget requires a super majority 3-
 
00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:48.389 --> 00:25:48.399 align:start position:0%
majority any other
 
00:25:50.870 --> 00:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
questions represent majority
 
00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
please thank you Mr Vice chairman and I
 
00:25:55.630 --> 00:25:55.640 align:start position:0%
may be asking the same question it's not
 
00:25:58.350 --> 00:25:58.360 align:start position:0%
it's not typical that the town meeting
 
00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:00.480 align:start position:0%
deliberative session I I'm I'm in an SP2
 
00:26:03.190 --> 00:26:03.200 align:start position:0%
Town increases the budget by substantial
 
00:26:05.110 --> 00:26:05.120 align:start position:0%
amounts it did happen this year in my
 
00:26:07.789 --> 00:26:07.799 align:start position:0%
town um there was a question about
 
00:26:10.710 --> 00:26:10.720 align:start position:0%
overtime uh there was a there was a uh a
 
00:26:12.389 --> 00:26:12.399 align:start position:0%
heated debate about that and the
 
00:26:14.590 --> 00:26:14.600 align:start position:0%
increase was
 
00:26:18.510 --> 00:26:18.520 align:start position:0%
significant so to to maybe piggyback on
 
00:26:21.190 --> 00:26:21.200 align:start position:0%
what representative Dolan was saying the
 
00:26:23.950 --> 00:26:23.960 align:start position:0%
increase in my town would have been 19%
 
00:26:28.990 --> 00:26:29.000 align:start position:0%
of that line which if we had a tax cap
 
00:26:32.149 --> 00:26:32.159 align:start position:0%
that and it pushed it over the tax cap
 
00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:34.240 align:start position:0%
we would have needed three-fifths of the
 
00:26:36.070 --> 00:26:36.080 align:start position:0%
deliberative session of the attendance
 
00:26:38.669 --> 00:26:38.679 align:start position:0%
of the deliberative session to override
 
00:26:41.630 --> 00:26:41.640 align:start position:0%
the tax cap to approve that increase not
 
00:26:42.990 --> 00:26:43.000 align:start position:0%
at the deliberative you would need
 
00:26:45.149 --> 00:26:45.159 align:start position:0%
three-fifths at the second session so to
 
00:26:47.269 --> 00:26:47.279 align:start position:0%
pass your
 
00:26:49.950 --> 00:26:49.960 align:start position:0%
budget so at the deliberative you could
 
00:26:51.710 --> 00:26:51.720 align:start position:0%
you could amend your budget as you know
 
00:26:53.310 --> 00:26:53.320 align:start position:0%
representative dlan alluded to you can
 
00:26:54.950 --> 00:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
amend your budget however you want and
 
00:26:56.990 --> 00:26:57.000 align:start position:0%
the legislative body can still amend it
 
00:26:59.430 --> 00:26:59.440 align:start position:0%
um to surpass the tax cap but to pass
 
00:27:00.990 --> 00:27:01.000 align:start position:0%
your budget you would need a super
 
00:27:02.350 --> 00:27:02.360 align:start position:0%
majority so at a traditional town
 
00:27:04.549 --> 00:27:04.559 align:start position:0%
meeting you couldn't leave until you
 
00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:06.880 align:start position:0%
have um either a super majority of any
 
00:27:09.430 --> 00:27:09.440 align:start position:0%
budget proposed by the legisl or every
 
00:27:11.389 --> 00:27:11.399 align:start position:0%
budget amended by the legislative body
 
00:27:13.630 --> 00:27:13.640 align:start position:0%
that surpasses the tax cap amount or a
 
00:27:15.310 --> 00:27:15.320 align:start position:0%
regular majority if it doesn't surpass
 
00:27:17.789 --> 00:27:17.799 align:start position:0%
the tax cap amount and at SP2 you would
 
00:27:19.470 --> 00:27:19.480 align:start position:0%
amend it at deliberative and if it
 
00:27:21.830 --> 00:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
surpass the tax cap amount um you know
 
00:27:23.710 --> 00:27:23.720 align:start position:0%
the tax cap calculation you would need
 
00:27:25.909 --> 00:27:25.919 align:start position:0%
three-fifths to pass the budget um at
 
00:27:30.789 --> 00:27:30.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:34.310 --> 00:27:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:36.750 --> 00:27:36.760 align:start position:0%
Murphy thank you Mr Vice chair thank you
 
00:27:38.789 --> 00:27:38.799 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I thought there
 
00:27:40.909 --> 00:27:40.919 align:start position:0%
was a
 
00:27:43.549 --> 00:27:43.559 align:start position:0%
10% uh you only can raise the budget by
 
00:27:47.310 --> 00:27:47.320 align:start position:0%
10% at delibera OB session no that might
 
00:27:49.269 --> 00:27:49.279 align:start position:0%
be because your community has adopted a
 
00:27:51.190 --> 00:27:51.200 align:start position:0%
tax cap provision and that's the
 
00:27:53.230 --> 00:27:53.240 align:start position:0%
provision is 10% there is a percentage
 
00:27:55.590 --> 00:27:55.600 align:start position:0%
option of the tax caps um this would
 
00:27:59.190 --> 00:27:59.200 align:start position:0%
mandate one um
 
00:28:01.669 --> 00:28:01.679 align:start position:0%
one type of override process for all tax
 
00:28:04.149 --> 00:28:04.159 align:start position:0%
caps um but it wouldn't impact the
 
00:28:06.990 --> 00:28:07.000 align:start position:0%
locally adopted you know whether it's a
 
00:28:09.269 --> 00:28:09.279 align:start position:0%
dollar figure tax cap or a percentage
 
00:28:11.549 --> 00:28:11.559 align:start position:0%
figure tax cap or I believe now in state
 
00:28:13.789 --> 00:28:13.799 align:start position:0%
law there's even tax caps where you can
 
00:28:20.149 --> 00:28:20.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:22.549 --> 00:28:22.559 align:start position:0%
inflation any other
 
00:28:24.990 --> 00:28:25.000 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you mras
 
00:28:29.430 --> 00:28:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:42.870 --> 00:28:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:45.669 --> 00:28:45.679 align:start position:0%

committee my name is Eric power I'm from
 
00:28:51.509 --> 00:28:51.519 align:start position:0%
Brookline representing myself just a
 
00:28:54.070 --> 00:28:54.080 align:start position:0%
little bit of my background um I
 
00:28:55.789 --> 00:28:55.799 align:start position:0%
currently serve on the Brookline
 
00:28:59.110 --> 00:28:59.120 align:start position:0%
planning board I'm in my fifth year I uh
 
00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:01.200 align:start position:0%
serve as the president of a organization
 
00:29:02.470 --> 00:29:02.480 align:start position:0%
called the school district governance
 
00:29:04.990 --> 00:29:05.000 align:start position:0%
Association of New Hampshire uh I
 
00:29:07.350 --> 00:29:07.360 align:start position:0%
previously served a three-year term as a
 
00:29:08.710 --> 00:29:08.720 align:start position:0%
school board member on the Hollis Brook

board and uh we also have a local tax
 
00:29:17.430 --> 00:29:17.440 align:start position:0%
cap in Brookline School District right
 
00:29:21.029 --> 00:29:21.039 align:start position:0%
now um I'm speaking in support of this
 
00:29:24.470 --> 00:29:24.480 align:start position:0%
bill and let me talk about a few reasons
 
00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
I think it's a good thing so for local
 
00:29:31.950 --> 00:29:31.960 align:start position:0%
local towns right now the only tax cap
 
00:29:35.430 --> 00:29:35.440 align:start position:0%
you can adopt is under RSA 325b and the
 
00:29:37.389 --> 00:29:37.399 align:start position:0%
adoptions under
 
00:29:41.190 --> 00:29:41.200 align:start position:0%
325c um with the change in law last year
 
00:29:43.110 --> 00:29:43.120 align:start position:0%
there are three methods within that that
 
00:29:45.070 --> 00:29:45.080 align:start position:0%
you can choose one's based on a fixed
 
00:29:47.070 --> 00:29:47.080 align:start position:0%
percentage one's based on a fixed dollar
 
00:29:49.590 --> 00:29:49.600 align:start position:0%
amount and one is based on an inflation
 
00:29:52.509 --> 00:29:52.519 align:start position:0%
based index you can choose anything from
 
00:29:55.470 --> 00:29:55.480 align:start position:0%
the US Bureau of Labor Statistics or the
 
00:29:58.389 --> 00:29:58.399 align:start position:0%
municipal cost index then it also just
 
00:30:00.269 --> 00:30:00.279 align:start position:0%
based on change in population in the
 
00:30:04.190 --> 00:30:04.200 align:start position:0%
town if it's a town tax cap or uh
 
00:30:06.470 --> 00:30:06.480 align:start position:0%
attendance uh
 
00:30:08.590 --> 00:30:08.600 align:start position:0%
admr average daily membership and
 
00:30:11.389 --> 00:30:11.399 align:start position:0%
residents for school districts so those
 
00:30:14.389 --> 00:30:14.399 align:start position:0%
there's only really the one RSA that
 
00:30:16.990 --> 00:30:17.000 align:start position:0%
allows the local Town tax
 
00:30:21.029 --> 00:30:21.039 align:start position:0%
caps right now currently there's six
 
00:30:22.909 --> 00:30:22.919 align:start position:0%
towns and two school districts in New
 
00:30:25.310 --> 00:30:25.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that have adopted uh the local
 
00:30:29.909 --> 00:30:29.919 align:start position:0%
tax cap and as was mentioned earlier the
 
00:30:32.789 --> 00:30:32.799 align:start position:0%
local tax cap to pass it is not an easy
 
00:30:35.710 --> 00:30:35.720 align:start position:0%
thing to do it's requires a three-fifths
 
00:30:39.110 --> 00:30:39.120 align:start position:0%
U majority vote at the district
 
00:30:41.789 --> 00:30:41.799 align:start position:0%
meeting the the thing that's that's
 
00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
disappointing with the tax cap is that
 
00:30:46.149 --> 00:30:46.159 align:start position:0%
even though a super majority voted to
 
00:30:48.950 --> 00:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
have it a simple majority can vote to
 
00:30:51.950 --> 00:30:51.960 align:start position:0%
override it and that's uh that's the
 
00:30:53.310 --> 00:30:53.320 align:start position:0%
challenge and that's what this attempts
 
00:30:56.389 --> 00:30:56.399 align:start position:0%
to fix because if you look at all the
 
00:30:58.549 --> 00:30:58.559 align:start position:0%
tax caps that are available in City they
 
00:31:00.830 --> 00:31:00.840 align:start position:0%
all have a super majority either a 2/3
 
00:31:03.430 --> 00:31:03.440 align:start position:0%
or a 3- fths uh super majority override
 
00:31:06.230 --> 00:31:06.240 align:start position:0%
so it makes a lot of sense to have that
 
00:31:09.149 --> 00:31:09.159 align:start position:0%
for the towns and school districts as
 
00:31:12.149 --> 00:31:12.159 align:start position:0%
well the
 
00:31:14.830 --> 00:31:14.840 align:start position:0%
uh there was a question about the
 
00:31:19.430 --> 00:31:19.440 align:start position:0%
10% um earlier the 10% rule is actually
 
00:31:22.190 --> 00:31:22.200 align:start position:0%
not related to tax caps it's independent
 
00:31:23.710 --> 00:31:23.720 align:start position:0%
of tax caps it has to do with an
 
00:31:25.430 --> 00:31:25.440 align:start position:0%
official budget committee so if you have
 
00:31:26.950 --> 00:31:26.960 align:start position:0%
an official budget Committee in your
 
00:31:28.669 --> 00:31:28.679 align:start position:0%
town or School District
 
00:31:30.509 --> 00:31:30.519 align:start position:0%
that would limmit the amount that the
 
00:31:32.190 --> 00:31:32.200 align:start position:0%
legislative body can go up and that's
 
00:31:34.750 --> 00:31:34.760 align:start position:0%
not part of the tax cap it's separate um
 
00:31:36.669 --> 00:31:36.679 align:start position:0%
if you have an official budget committee
 
00:31:37.830 --> 00:31:37.840 align:start position:0%
if you don't have one you don't have
 
00:31:41.070 --> 00:31:41.080 align:start position:0%
that limitation or that ceiling I'd like
 
00:31:43.909 --> 00:31:43.919 align:start position:0%
to also mention that the legislature
 
00:31:48.830 --> 00:31:48.840 align:start position:0%
does change laws over time where the uh
 
00:31:50.549 --> 00:31:50.559 align:start position:0%
school districts and towns do not have
 
00:31:53.950 --> 00:31:53.960 align:start position:0%
to reopt the provisions uh when they
 
00:31:56.950 --> 00:31:56.960 align:start position:0%
change and uh a prime example of that is
 
00:31:58.509 --> 00:31:58.519 align:start position:0%
our s SP2
 
00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:01.760 align:start position:0%
official ballot system of meeting that
 
00:32:03.789 --> 00:32:03.799 align:start position:0%
that was first done in
 
00:32:06.789 --> 00:32:06.799 align:start position:0%
1995 I believe and it's changed many
 
00:32:10.830 --> 00:32:10.840 align:start position:0%
times and so over the years uh towns and
 
00:32:13.549 --> 00:32:13.559 align:start position:0%
school districts that have adopted SP2
 
00:32:16.149 --> 00:32:16.159 align:start position:0%
you know they keep the they they go with
 
00:32:17.830 --> 00:32:17.840 align:start position:0%
whatever the changes are to the
 
00:32:21.110 --> 00:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
legislature by yourselves as elected
 
00:32:22.590 --> 00:32:22.600 align:start position:0%
representative decide to change there's
 
00:32:25.470 --> 00:32:25.480 align:start position:0%
no read-option needed so that that
 
00:32:28.269 --> 00:32:28.279 align:start position:0%
that's not necessary also we change uh
 
00:32:29.990 --> 00:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
that the legislature changes things on
 
00:32:31.669 --> 00:32:31.679 align:start position:0%
tax credits and others that don't
 
00:32:33.629 --> 00:32:33.639 align:start position:0%
necessarily require
 
00:32:37.269 --> 00:32:37.279 align:start position:0%
read-option so um I'd like to mention so
 
00:32:40.590 --> 00:32:40.600 align:start position:0%
the the idea of the tax cap I can answer
 
00:32:42.830 --> 00:32:42.840 align:start position:0%
more questions on this later but when
 
00:32:45.310 --> 00:32:45.320 align:start position:0%
you have a tax cap in a traditional
 
00:32:48.470 --> 00:32:48.480 align:start position:0%
meeting you have your prior years you
 
00:32:52.990 --> 00:32:53.000 align:start position:0%
know Ms 736 737 for towns in the ms26
 
00:32:55.710 --> 00:32:55.720 align:start position:0%
and 27 for school districts that tell
 
00:32:57.190 --> 00:32:57.200 align:start position:0%
you what the tax effort was from the
 
00:32:58.789 --> 00:32:58.799 align:start position:0%
previous year and what the tax efforts
 
00:33:00.830 --> 00:33:00.840 align:start position:0%
proposed for this year so you know as
 
00:33:02.310 --> 00:33:02.320 align:start position:0%
you're going through your annual meeting
 
00:33:04.549 --> 00:33:04.559 align:start position:0%
when you're approaching that tax cap and
 
00:33:06.830 --> 00:33:06.840 align:start position:0%
when the moderator and the clerk see
 
00:33:09.389 --> 00:33:09.399 align:start position:0%
that a proposed vote on an appropriation
 
00:33:11.190 --> 00:33:11.200 align:start position:0%
will exceed the tax cap they will make
 
00:33:13.549 --> 00:33:13.559 align:start position:0%
that go by ballot secret ballot so that
 
00:33:15.669 --> 00:33:15.679 align:start position:0%
you can determine the Three-Fifths
 
00:33:18.509 --> 00:33:18.519 align:start position:0%
majority um so that's how that works in
 
00:33:21.070 --> 00:33:21.080 align:start position:0%
a traditional meeting and in sb2 town
 
00:33:24.190 --> 00:33:24.200 align:start position:0%
the deliberative and School District the
 
00:33:27.909 --> 00:33:27.919 align:start position:0%
the school district uh in the town they
 
00:33:29.870 --> 00:33:29.880 align:start position:0%
just they put things on the warrant so
 
00:33:31.029 --> 00:33:31.039 align:start position:0%
at a deliberative session you're
 
00:33:33.029 --> 00:33:33.039 align:start position:0%
preparing things for the official
 
00:33:34.830 --> 00:33:34.840 align:start position:0%
balloting session that happens on
 
00:33:37.590 --> 00:33:37.600 align:start position:0%
Election Day and so all of the three-
 
00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
fifths is determined by what passes and
 
00:33:41.950 --> 00:33:41.960 align:start position:0%
what doesn't based on the order of the
 
00:33:45.549 --> 00:33:45.559 align:start position:0%
warrant articles on the uh on the ballot
 
00:33:47.190 --> 00:33:47.200 align:start position:0%
so it matters how how the warrant
 
00:33:51.070 --> 00:33:51.080 align:start position:0%
articles are uh ordered for when the
 
00:33:52.990 --> 00:33:53.000 align:start position:0%
three fifs kicks in and then you just
 
00:33:55.430 --> 00:33:55.440 align:start position:0%
determine whether to apply the 3- fifths
 
00:33:57.789 --> 00:33:57.799 align:start position:0%
or to apply the simple majority
 
00:33:59.190 --> 00:33:59.200 align:start position:0%
depending whether you're over or under
 
00:34:01.870 --> 00:34:01.880 align:start position:0%
the tax cap on that particular warrant
 
00:34:05.269 --> 00:34:05.279 align:start position:0%
article I'd like to also mention in the
 
00:34:09.470 --> 00:34:09.480 align:start position:0%
uh hb2 200 amendment that um under
 
00:34:13.790 --> 00:34:13.800 align:start position:0%
Section A it talks about the uh if your
 
00:34:15.310 --> 00:34:15.320 align:start position:0%
operating budget is the one that is
 
00:34:18.950 --> 00:34:18.960 align:start position:0%
going over the tax cap that if you pass
 
00:34:20.869 --> 00:34:20.879 align:start position:0%
it by three fifths whatever is proposed
 
00:34:23.990 --> 00:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
will will be adopted but if it passes
 
00:34:26.869 --> 00:34:26.879 align:start position:0%
with a simple majority but not the not
 
00:34:29.349 --> 00:34:29.359 align:start position:0%
the three- fifths maj majority the
 
00:34:32.869 --> 00:34:32.879 align:start position:0%
adopted budget will be truncated to uh
 
00:34:36.230 --> 00:34:36.240 align:start position:0%
to the whatever the tax cap Max is same
 
00:34:37.950 --> 00:34:37.960 align:start position:0%
thing with the default budget if the
 
00:34:39.589 --> 00:34:39.599 align:start position:0%
default budget in some towns is higher
 
00:34:41.190 --> 00:34:41.200 align:start position:0%
than the proposed budget the default
 
00:34:42.710 --> 00:34:42.720 align:start position:0%
budget goes over and it doesn't get the
 
00:34:44.510 --> 00:34:44.520 align:start position:0%
three- fifths and it won't because you
 
00:34:45.669 --> 00:34:45.679 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be getting a default budget
 
00:34:47.230 --> 00:34:47.240 align:start position:0%
You' only get that if you get a simple
 
00:34:49.669 --> 00:34:49.679 align:start position:0%
lower lower than a simple majority that
 
00:34:51.750 --> 00:34:51.760 align:start position:0%
would also be truncated so there's the
 
00:34:53.470 --> 00:34:53.480 align:start position:0%
operating budget is going to be
 
00:34:55.270 --> 00:34:55.280 align:start position:0%
compliant with the tax cap there's not a
 
00:34:58.190 --> 00:34:58.200 align:start position:0%
a way around it so that that's what the
 
00:35:00.670 --> 00:35:00.680 align:start position:0%
purpose of this is to really ensure that
 
00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:02.640 align:start position:0%
when you have spending that exceeds the
 
00:35:04.750 --> 00:35:04.760 align:start position:0%
tax cap that it's agreeable to a super
 
00:35:06.510 --> 00:35:06.520 align:start position:0%
majority of the voters and not just a
 
00:35:11.230 --> 00:35:11.240 align:start position:0%
simple majority so um for those reasons
 
00:35:14.349 --> 00:35:14.359 align:start position:0%
uh I I urge you to support uh this bill
 
00:35:15.630 --> 00:35:15.640 align:start position:0%
ought to pass with Amendment and I'll
 
00:35:17.790 --> 00:35:17.800 align:start position:0%
take any
 
00:35:20.270 --> 00:35:20.280 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Mr power any
 
00:35:23.710 --> 00:35:23.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:26.950 --> 00:35:26.960 align:start position:0%
power representative gr thank you Mr
 
00:35:29.190 --> 00:35:29.200 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you taking my question
 
00:35:33.390 --> 00:35:33.400 align:start position:0%
um one of the in pieces in here on line
 
00:35:35.390 --> 00:35:35.400 align:start position:0%
20 School District shall place the
 
00:35:37.109 --> 00:35:37.119 align:start position:0%
warrant article for the SAU budget the
 
00:35:38.589 --> 00:35:38.599 align:start position:0%
beginning of the school district warrant
 
00:35:39.870 --> 00:35:39.880 align:start position:0%
immediately after warrant article
 
00:35:41.390 --> 00:35:41.400 align:start position:0%
proposed by bonds or
 
00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:43.680 align:start position:0%
notes I'm kind of curious on what your
 
00:35:45.230 --> 00:35:45.240 align:start position:0%
opinion is because when if you do bonds
 
00:35:47.910 --> 00:35:47.920 align:start position:0%
and notes first the tax impact is
 
00:35:50.190 --> 00:35:50.200 align:start position:0%
typically pretty high and then you're
 
00:35:51.750 --> 00:35:51.760 align:start position:0%
going to put the SAU so everything is
 
00:35:53.630 --> 00:35:53.640 align:start position:0%
going to probably fall outside of tax
 
00:35:55.270 --> 00:35:55.280 align:start position:0%
cap immediately but I'm curious on what
 
00:35:57.270 --> 00:35:57.280 align:start position:0%
your opinion is on whether that would be
 
00:35:59.470 --> 00:35:59.480 align:start position:0%
affective budgets or not thank you for
 
00:36:01.670 --> 00:36:01.680 align:start position:0%
the question representative grund so
 
00:36:03.790 --> 00:36:03.800 align:start position:0%
when you're doing a bond or a note
 
00:36:06.270 --> 00:36:06.280 align:start position:0%
you're doing an authorization to do a
 
00:36:08.670 --> 00:36:08.680 align:start position:0%
bond but you're only appropriating the
 
00:36:12.150 --> 00:36:12.160 align:start position:0%
first year payment so that if you had a
 
00:36:15.710 --> 00:36:15.720 align:start position:0%
bond of $2 million you might have
 
00:36:17.790 --> 00:36:17.800 align:start position:0%
$200,000 uh first year payment or you
 
00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:19.200 align:start position:0%
might even be smaller than that that
 
00:36:21.150 --> 00:36:21.160 align:start position:0%
would be the one that would be counted
 
00:36:23.349 --> 00:36:23.359 align:start position:0%
for the purposes of the tax cap not the
 
00:36:28.510 --> 00:36:28.520 align:start position:0%
entire Bond um for those aren't aware
 
00:36:32.829 --> 00:36:32.839 align:start position:0%
school districts can have optionally a
 
00:36:35.670 --> 00:36:35.680 align:start position:0%
uh warant article for the SAU budget
 
00:36:37.349 --> 00:36:37.359 align:start position:0%
there's some that do if you have a
 
00:36:38.910 --> 00:36:38.920 align:start position:0%
there's a difference between a single
 
00:36:41.470 --> 00:36:41.480 align:start position:0%
District SAU which is which is an seu
 
00:36:43.950 --> 00:36:43.960 align:start position:0%
that serves just one school district and
 
00:36:46.829 --> 00:36:46.839 align:start position:0%
then there are saus that serve multiple
 
00:36:49.470 --> 00:36:49.480 align:start position:0%
school districts and I am in a
 
00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
multi-district SAU in sau41 we have
 
00:36:56.309 --> 00:36:56.319 align:start position:0%
three school districts within the SAU So
 
00:36:58.470 --> 00:36:58.480 align:start position:0%
currently um
 
00:37:02.309 --> 00:37:02.319 align:start position:0%
you can adopt a procedure under RSA 194c
 
00:37:05.309 --> 00:37:05.319 align:start position:0%
to have a ballot vote that's enabling
 
00:37:06.870 --> 00:37:06.880 align:start position:0%
legislation we actually have adopted
 
00:37:08.550 --> 00:37:08.560 align:start position:0%
that in our district so we have a we
 
00:37:11.069 --> 00:37:11.079 align:start position:0%
have a separate warn article in every of
 
00:37:13.670 --> 00:37:13.680 align:start position:0%
the districts that uh to vote on that
 
00:37:16.190 --> 00:37:16.200 align:start position:0%
and because of the um because of that
 
00:37:18.710 --> 00:37:18.720 align:start position:0%
nature of it it needs to be first
 
00:37:21.349 --> 00:37:21.359 align:start position:0%
because it's very unlikely that bonds
 
00:37:23.190 --> 00:37:23.200 align:start position:0%
and notes are going to exceed the tax
 
00:37:25.510 --> 00:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
cap if you're only looking at the
 
00:37:27.069 --> 00:37:27.079 align:start position:0%
appropriation for the first year which
 
00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
is what the the tax cap is looking at
 
00:37:31.230 --> 00:37:31.240 align:start position:0%
that's what you list uh when you're
 
00:37:33.510 --> 00:37:33.520 align:start position:0%
doing a bond or note you you list the
 
00:37:36.309 --> 00:37:36.319 align:start position:0%
tax impact for the first year uh on the
 
00:37:36.319 --> 00:37:39.630 align:start position:0%
tax impact for the first year uh on the
MS

00:37:39.630 --> 00:37:39.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:43.069 --> 00:37:43.079 align:start position:0%
forms any other
 
00:37:46.190 --> 00:37:46.200 align:start position:0%
questions certainly go ahead thank you
 
00:37:48.190 --> 00:37:48.200 align:start position:0%
um so yes the first year right it's the
 
00:37:51.190 --> 00:37:51.200 align:start position:0%
interest the second year if that Bond
 
00:37:53.430 --> 00:37:53.440 align:start position:0%
passes that payment's now in there and
 
00:37:57.950 --> 00:37:57.960 align:start position:0%
that's where the impact hits um
 
00:38:01.349 --> 00:38:01.359 align:start position:0%
so it's you're going to hit that tax cap
 
00:38:01.359 --> 00:38:02.750 align:start position:0%
so it's you're going to hit that tax cap
really

00:38:02.750 --> 00:38:02.760 align:start position:0%
really
 
00:38:05.550 --> 00:38:05.560 align:start position:0%
fast and it's I don't know I'm I'm
 
00:38:06.950 --> 00:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
concerned about the misleading nature of
 
00:38:10.109 --> 00:38:10.119 align:start position:0%
always making the bond first
 
00:38:13.069 --> 00:38:13.079 align:start position:0%
um because you typically school school
 
00:38:15.390 --> 00:38:15.400 align:start position:0%
boards get to decide the placement and
 
00:38:17.589 --> 00:38:17.599 align:start position:0%
Order of the warrant
 
00:38:19.589 --> 00:38:19.599 align:start position:0%
articles thank you for the question I
 
00:38:23.670 --> 00:38:23.680 align:start position:0%
think it was a question the um the once
 
00:38:27.030 --> 00:38:27.040 align:start position:0%
the bond is passed it is typically not a
 
00:38:28.870 --> 00:38:28.880 align:start position:0%
warn article in following years it
 
00:38:31.630 --> 00:38:31.640 align:start position:0%
usually the bond payment becomes part of
 
00:38:33.510 --> 00:38:33.520 align:start position:0%
the operating budget so that would be
 
00:38:34.950 --> 00:38:34.960 align:start position:0%
part of the operating budget warnant
 
00:38:37.550 --> 00:38:37.560 align:start position:0%
article it's only the first year when
 
00:38:39.589 --> 00:38:39.599 align:start position:0%
the uh bond is proposed that it's
 
00:38:44.829 --> 00:38:44.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:48.150 --> 00:38:48.160 align:start position:0%
article repres majority thank you Mr
 
00:38:49.430 --> 00:38:49.440 align:start position:0%
Vice chair and thank you for taking my
 
00:38:51.670 --> 00:38:51.680 align:start position:0%
question um I'm not a school board
 
00:38:54.150 --> 00:38:54.160 align:start position:0%
person so this question may not even
 
00:38:56.190 --> 00:38:56.200 align:start position:0%
apply but in a Cooperative School
 
00:38:58.870 --> 00:38:58.880 align:start position:0%
District where you have a collective
 
00:39:01.309 --> 00:39:01.319 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreement if one of those
 
00:39:04.430 --> 00:39:04.440 align:start position:0%
communities has a tax cap we have five
 
00:39:06.630 --> 00:39:06.640 align:start position:0%
that that are in our Cooperative if one
 
00:39:09.150 --> 00:39:09.160 align:start position:0%
of those school districts has a tax cap
 
00:39:11.230 --> 00:39:11.240 align:start position:0%
and the collective bargaining agreement
 
00:39:14.309 --> 00:39:14.319 align:start position:0%
would push that one school district
 
00:39:14.319 --> 00:39:18.270 align:start position:0%
would push that one school district
over

00:39:18.270 --> 00:39:18.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:21.670 --> 00:39:21.680 align:start position:0%
theirs what's my
 
00:39:24.349 --> 00:39:24.359 align:start position:0%
question is there is there a problem
 
00:39:26.430 --> 00:39:26.440 align:start position:0%
could there be a problem if only one of
 
00:39:30.109 --> 00:39:30.119 align:start position:0%
those communities has the tax cap and
 
00:39:32.150 --> 00:39:32.160 align:start position:0%
then this pushes them over and they
 
00:39:35.109 --> 00:39:35.119 align:start position:0%
cannot override the tax cap and then the
 
00:39:37.190 --> 00:39:37.200 align:start position:0%
entire collective bargaining agreement
 
00:39:38.750 --> 00:39:38.760 align:start position:0%
would fail do do you see where I'm going
 
00:39:40.910 --> 00:39:40.920 align:start position:0%
even though I'm not really asking a
 
00:39:43.109 --> 00:39:43.119 align:start position:0%
question or is it not even
 
00:39:45.030 --> 00:39:45.040 align:start position:0%
appropriate uh thank you representative
 
00:39:48.430 --> 00:39:48.440 align:start position:0%
maiori I think I understand it so tax
 
00:39:52.710 --> 00:39:52.720 align:start position:0%
caps are adopted by individual school
 
00:39:56.710 --> 00:39:56.720 align:start position:0%
districts so if you had like the exiter
 
00:39:56.720 --> 00:39:57.829 align:start position:0%
districts so if you had like the exiter
cooperative

00:39:57.829 --> 00:39:57.839 align:start position:0%
cooperative
 
00:39:59.349 --> 00:39:59.359 align:start position:0%
a Regional School District they could
 
00:40:03.910 --> 00:40:03.920 align:start position:0%
adopt a tax cap um in our town we have
 
00:40:05.510 --> 00:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
the Brookline School
 
00:40:08.870 --> 00:40:08.880 align:start position:0%
District which is K through six and then
 
00:40:11.109 --> 00:40:11.119 align:start position:0%
we have and that has a tax cap and then
 
00:40:12.710 --> 00:40:12.720 align:start position:0%
we have a separate Hollis Brookland
 
00:40:14.470 --> 00:40:14.480 align:start position:0%
Cooperative School District which are is
 
00:40:16.349 --> 00:40:16.359 align:start position:0%
grades 7 to 12 that does not have the
 
00:40:19.270 --> 00:40:19.280 align:start position:0%
tax cap they're two separate political
 
00:40:21.550 --> 00:40:21.560 align:start position:0%
entities so what we have for the
 
00:40:23.910 --> 00:40:23.920 align:start position:0%
Brookline School District doesn't affect
 
00:40:26.470 --> 00:40:26.480 align:start position:0%
the co-op vice versa so it's they're
 
00:40:28.190 --> 00:40:28.200 align:start position:0%
done individually so they're they're
 
00:40:31.550 --> 00:40:31.560 align:start position:0%
really independent so if the if your
 
00:40:33.589 --> 00:40:33.599 align:start position:0%
larger District adopted the tax cap and
 
00:40:36.750 --> 00:40:36.760 align:start position:0%
it and the CBA went over then that would
 
00:40:38.550 --> 00:40:38.560 align:start position:0%
be something would need the override in
 
00:40:40.829 --> 00:40:40.839 align:start position:0%
order to support it if it was if that
 
00:40:42.589 --> 00:40:42.599 align:start position:0%
was the article that went over the tax
 
00:40:44.309 --> 00:40:44.319 align:start position:0%
cap if it went before the operating
 
00:40:46.390 --> 00:40:46.400 align:start position:0%
budget then if the operating budget went
 
00:40:48.270 --> 00:40:48.280 align:start position:0%
over um that would be where the
 
00:40:50.430 --> 00:40:50.440 align:start position:0%
Three-Fifths would kick in hopefully
 
00:40:52.309 --> 00:40:52.319 align:start position:0%
when there's budgeting under a tax cap
 
00:40:54.150 --> 00:40:54.160 align:start position:0%
the whole idea of a tax cap is so that
 
00:40:56.270 --> 00:40:56.280 align:start position:0%
you plan so that your budget doesn't go
 
00:40:58.030 --> 00:40:58.040 align:start position:0%
over the tax cap and you wouldn't even
 
00:40:59.589 --> 00:40:59.599 align:start position:0%
need the override mechanism that's the
 
00:41:02.430 --> 00:41:02.440 align:start position:0%
whole idea is people want the uh the
 
00:41:04.790 --> 00:41:04.800 align:start position:0%
budgets to stay reasonable underneath
 
00:41:08.670 --> 00:41:08.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:11.230 --> 00:41:11.240 align:start position:0%
them representative
 
00:41:14.750 --> 00:41:14.760 align:start position:0%
gr thank you Mr chair so I think I know
 
00:41:15.950 --> 00:41:15.960 align:start position:0%
piece of where you might be going with
 
00:41:17.910 --> 00:41:17.920 align:start position:0%
this so in Cooperative school districts
 
00:41:20.430 --> 00:41:20.440 align:start position:0%
so I'm so heagan I have Amhurst and Mont
 
00:41:23.069 --> 00:41:23.079 align:start position:0%
Vernon and if we had a tax
 
00:41:25.309 --> 00:41:25.319 align:start position:0%
cap we had there's two different tax
 
00:41:28.309 --> 00:41:28.319 align:start position:0%
rates that get calculated for each town
 
00:41:30.270 --> 00:41:30.280 align:start position:0%
so what is that let's say you have a 2%
 
00:41:33.990 --> 00:41:34.000 align:start position:0%
tax cap 2% is different for Amherst and
 
00:41:37.950 --> 00:41:37.960 align:start position:0%
it is for Mont Vernon you present one
 
00:41:41.150 --> 00:41:41.160 align:start position:0%
budget but what happens when you exceed
 
00:41:44.390 --> 00:41:44.400 align:start position:0%
one what happens if it does Super do you
 
00:41:45.910 --> 00:41:45.920 align:start position:0%
see where I'm going like you can really
 
00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:46.990 align:start position:0%
see where I'm going like you can really
start

00:41:46.990 --> 00:41:47.000 align:start position:0%
start
 
00:41:52.309 --> 00:41:52.319 align:start position:0%
affecting budgets with tax that tax cap
 
00:41:54.390 --> 00:41:54.400 align:start position:0%
and calculating the tax rate in each
 
00:41:56.430 --> 00:41:56.440 align:start position:0%
town and where does your budget fall out
 
00:41:59.309 --> 00:41:59.319 align:start position:0%
potentially if it
 
00:42:02.030 --> 00:42:02.040 align:start position:0%
passes thank you for the question I I
 
00:42:05.950 --> 00:42:05.960 align:start position:0%
believe it's SE 39 so my understanding
 
00:42:09.349 --> 00:42:09.359 align:start position:0%
sau39 has three school districts it has
 
00:42:11.109 --> 00:42:11.119 align:start position:0%
the mount fernon School District it has
 
00:42:13.270 --> 00:42:13.280 align:start position:0%
the ammer school district and it has the
 
00:42:16.309 --> 00:42:16.319 align:start position:0%
Sagan Cooperative School District so
 
00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:19.200 align:start position:0%
each one of those uh is an independent
 
00:42:22.190 --> 00:42:22.200 align:start position:0%
entity with their own budget their own
 
00:42:24.589 --> 00:42:24.599 align:start position:0%
governance their own annual meeting
 
00:42:27.390 --> 00:42:27.400 align:start position:0%
their if they have SP2 their own ballot
 
00:42:29.510 --> 00:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
um and I think there is SP2 there if I
 
00:42:33.589 --> 00:42:33.599 align:start position:0%
remember so if sa heagan decided to
 
00:42:37.349 --> 00:42:37.359 align:start position:0%
implement a tax cap it would only limit
 
00:42:39.470 --> 00:42:39.480 align:start position:0%
the tax effort and it could be
 
00:42:42.990 --> 00:42:43.000 align:start position:0%
overridden for the Sagan school district
 
00:42:44.910 --> 00:42:44.920 align:start position:0%
and being a school board member from The
 
00:42:47.230 --> 00:42:47.240 align:start position:0%
Cooperative I'm very familiar with this
 
00:42:50.030 --> 00:42:50.040 align:start position:0%
that in so you're looking at the tax
 
00:42:52.190 --> 00:42:52.200 align:start position:0%
effort for the whole saan school
 
00:42:55.470 --> 00:42:55.480 align:start position:0%
district for example so if you have a
 
00:42:59.030 --> 00:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
tax cap that that keeps you to $12
 
00:43:04.150 --> 00:43:04.160 align:start position:0%
million for a number and you
 
00:43:08.710 --> 00:43:08.720 align:start position:0%
um you want to exceed that it's it's
 
00:43:10.470 --> 00:43:10.480 align:start position:0%
that's that what's the voters can do
 
00:43:12.710 --> 00:43:12.720 align:start position:0%
that it's one single tax cap but after
 
00:43:15.750 --> 00:43:15.760 align:start position:0%
the tax effort is determined and voted
 
00:43:18.270 --> 00:43:18.280 align:start position:0%
upon whether it goes over the tax cap or
 
00:43:20.630 --> 00:43:20.640 align:start position:0%
not that goes through the apportionment
 
00:43:22.309 --> 00:43:22.319 align:start position:0%
formula that you have in your articles
 
00:43:23.950 --> 00:43:23.960 align:start position:0%
of agreement for your Cooperative School
 
00:43:27.990 --> 00:43:28.000 align:start position:0%
District so it's the tax effort for the
 
00:43:30.910 --> 00:43:30.920 align:start position:0%
co-op is limited but when you apportion
 
00:43:34.190 --> 00:43:34.200 align:start position:0%
it to I think Amherst and Mount
 
00:43:36.390 --> 00:43:36.400 align:start position:0%
Vernon the tax effort might be higher
 
00:43:39.190 --> 00:43:39.200 align:start position:0%
for Mount Vernon than it might be but
 
00:43:40.870 --> 00:43:40.880 align:start position:0%
the net effort for the whole school
 
00:43:43.510 --> 00:43:43.520 align:start position:0%
district and a co-op would be limited by
 
00:43:45.390 --> 00:43:45.400 align:start position:0%
the tax cap and and that was where you'd
 
00:43:48.190 --> 00:43:48.200 align:start position:0%
have to have the override so in a school
 
00:43:49.710 --> 00:43:49.720 align:start position:0%
district it's possible that you could
 
00:43:53.030 --> 00:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
obey the tax cap and some would still be
 
00:43:54.390 --> 00:43:54.400 align:start position:0%
above the tax effort they get a
 
00:43:55.950 --> 00:43:55.960 align:start position:0%
portioned is higher that's just the way
 
00:43:57.430 --> 00:43:57.440 align:start position:0%
Cooperative school districts work and
 
00:43:58.670 --> 00:43:58.680 align:start position:0%
there are problems with Cooperative
 
00:43:59.710 --> 00:43:59.720 align:start position:0%
School District that's a whole another
 
00:44:02.109 --> 00:44:02.119 align:start position:0%
issue but it's it's really the
 
00:44:04.710 --> 00:44:04.720 align:start position:0%
conglomerate of the whole budget for the

which was signed into law last year so
 
00:46:24.309 --> 00:46:24.319 align:start position:0%
some issues were identified as towns and
 
00:46:26.549 --> 00:46:26.559 align:start position:0%
school districts began applying the new
 
00:46:28.910 --> 00:46:28.920 align:start position:0%
local tax cap and The New School
 
00:46:33.390 --> 00:46:33.400 align:start position:0%
District budget cap during this um 2025
 
00:46:36.790 --> 00:46:36.800 align:start position:0%
annual meeting season the goal of House
 
00:46:40.069 --> 00:46:40.079 align:start position:0%
Bill 374 is to ensure that all towns and
 
00:46:42.670 --> 00:46:42.680 align:start position:0%
school districts have a clear
 
00:46:45.670 --> 00:46:45.680 align:start position:0%
understanding of how the local tax cap
 
00:46:48.630 --> 00:46:48.640 align:start position:0%
and the School District budget cap are
 
00:46:52.430 --> 00:46:52.440 align:start position:0%
proposed adopted and then how they
 
00:46:55.270 --> 00:46:55.280 align:start position:0%
function to Briefly summarize current
 
00:46:58.990 --> 00:46:59.000 align:start position:0%
RSA the local tax cap law which is under
 
00:47:03.910 --> 00:47:03.920 align:start position:0%
um 32 colon 5B and 32 colon
 
00:47:07.430 --> 00:47:07.440 align:start position:0%
5-c that was updated to add a new method
 
00:47:10.150 --> 00:47:10.160 align:start position:0%
for annually Computing the tax cap which
 
00:47:13.069 --> 00:47:13.079 align:start position:0%
is based on an inflation index and the
 
00:47:16.109 --> 00:47:16.119 align:start position:0%
change in the populace which for school
 
00:47:18.030 --> 00:47:18.040 align:start position:0%
districts would be the change in the
 
00:47:21.190 --> 00:47:21.200 align:start position:0%
number of students and for towns it is
 
00:47:24.589 --> 00:47:24.599 align:start position:0%
the change in the town's population the
 
00:47:28.710 --> 00:47:28.720 align:start position:0%
School District budget cap law um RSA 32
 
00:47:34.589 --> 00:47:34.599 align:start position:0%
colon 5-e and RSA 32 colon 5-f is brand
 
00:47:37.950 --> 00:47:37.960 align:start position:0%
new the budget cap is based on an
 
00:47:40.549 --> 00:47:40.559 align:start position:0%
adopted cost per student each year the
 
00:47:43.230 --> 00:47:43.240 align:start position:0%
budget cap is computed as the current
 
00:47:46.430 --> 00:47:46.440 align:start position:0%
cost per student times the number of
 
00:47:49.069 --> 00:47:49.079 align:start position:0%
students annually the current cost per
 
00:47:52.069 --> 00:47:52.079 align:start position:0%
student is updated based on
 
00:47:55.390 --> 00:47:55.400 align:start position:0%
inflation so um as you see there is an
 
00:48:00.270 --> 00:48:00.280 align:start position:0%
amendment um to um House Bill 374 and
 
00:48:03.990 --> 00:48:04.000 align:start position:0%
you should have that at your um desk
 
00:48:24.549 --> 00:48:24.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:28.309 --> 00:48:28.319 align:start position:0%
225-5787 Bill 383 three this amendment
 
00:48:30.510 --> 00:48:30.520 align:start position:0%
also adds and corrects important
 
00:48:34.109 --> 00:48:34.119 align:start position:0%
references to other rsas including those
 
00:48:36.230 --> 00:48:36.240 align:start position:0%
for population and average daily
 
00:48:38.710 --> 00:48:38.720 align:start position:0%
membership in residents
 
00:48:41.630 --> 00:48:41.640 align:start position:0%
admr the amendment adds missing
 
00:48:44.190 --> 00:48:44.200 align:start position:0%
statutory ref warrant article language
 
00:48:46.750 --> 00:48:46.760 align:start position:0%
for certain cases the amendment
 
00:48:49.510 --> 00:48:49.520 align:start position:0%
clarifies that an existing tax cap can
 
00:48:53.829 --> 00:48:53.839 align:start position:0%
be modified by adopting a new tax cap
 
00:48:58.589 --> 00:48:58.599 align:start position:0%
and the same applies also for budget cap
 
00:49:01.470 --> 00:49:01.480 align:start position:0%
and also this amendment changes the the
 
00:49:04.230 --> 00:49:04.240 align:start position:0%
date that the annual inflation index is
 
00:49:09.230 --> 00:49:09.240 align:start position:0%
used from January 1st to October 1st so
 
00:49:13.069 --> 00:49:13.079 align:start position:0%
that that infl inflation index change is
 
00:49:16.190 --> 00:49:16.200 align:start position:0%
available for the budgeting process
 
00:49:20.390 --> 00:49:20.400 align:start position:0%
which occurs um typically starting in
 
00:49:25.230 --> 00:49:25.240 align:start position:0%
August fall so uh an additional handout
 
00:49:29.309 --> 00:49:29.319 align:start position:0%
I I um prepared a a side by side and
 
00:49:31.950 --> 00:49:31.960 align:start position:0%
it's pretty comprehensive it's a table
 
00:49:35.430 --> 00:49:35.440 align:start position:0%
that um Compares like I said side by
 
00:49:37.950 --> 00:49:37.960 align:start position:0%
side current law and what the amendment
 
00:49:40.950 --> 00:49:40.960 align:start position:0%
is doing so yeah the amendment replaces
 
00:49:42.950 --> 00:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
the bill that was filed because as we
 
00:49:47.710 --> 00:49:47.720 align:start position:0%
went on um there were issues that that
 
00:49:51.470 --> 00:49:51.480 align:start position:0%
arose that um made sense to put in to to
 
00:49:56.990 --> 00:49:57.000 align:start position:0%
this bill um in an amendment so and so
 
00:49:59.630 --> 00:49:59.640 align:start position:0%
as you can see I have current law the
 
00:50:02.390 --> 00:50:02.400 align:start position:0%
amendment and also the last column on
 
00:50:05.230 --> 00:50:05.240 align:start position:0%
the right is comments which does
 
00:50:09.109 --> 00:50:09.119 align:start position:0%
describe um what the amendment does over
 
00:50:14.270 --> 00:50:14.280 align:start position:0%
the current law so um to conclude I urge
 
00:50:17.309 --> 00:50:17.319 align:start position:0%
that the committee recommend House Bill
 
00:50:20.910 --> 00:50:20.920 align:start position:0%
374 a housekeeping Bill ought to pass
 
00:50:23.309 --> 00:50:23.319 align:start position:0%
with amendment that concludes my bill
 
00:50:25.710 --> 00:50:25.720 align:start position:0%
introduction and I'm happy to go over
 
00:50:29.069 --> 00:50:29.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:30.750 --> 00:50:30.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative any questions
 
00:50:34.190 --> 00:50:34.200 align:start position:0%

you okay our last speaker will be uh Mr
 
00:51:01.349 --> 00:51:01.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:04.109 --> 00:51:04.119 align:start position:0%
thank you committee members good morning
 
00:51:06.390 --> 00:51:06.400 align:start position:0%
uh my name is Eric power I am from
 
00:51:08.829 --> 00:51:08.839 align:start position:0%
Brookline and I'm in support of this
 
00:51:12.950 --> 00:51:12.960 align:start position:0%
bill um HB 374 is a really important
 
00:51:14.870 --> 00:51:14.880 align:start position:0%
bill uh to
 
00:51:17.990 --> 00:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
clarify uh the local tax cap law and the
 
00:51:21.190 --> 00:51:21.200 align:start position:0%
new School District budget cap law uh
 
00:51:24.190 --> 00:51:24.200 align:start position:0%
these were new Bills new a new law last
 
00:51:27.150 --> 00:51:27.160 align:start position:0%
year uh that took effect October first
 
00:51:29.589 --> 00:51:29.599 align:start position:0%
based on Senate Bill
 
00:51:32.910 --> 00:51:32.920 align:start position:0%
383 and these B the School District
 
00:51:35.109 --> 00:51:35.119 align:start position:0%
budget cap and the local tax cap have
 
00:51:39.549 --> 00:51:39.559 align:start position:0%
both been um very uh utilized this
 
00:51:41.630 --> 00:51:41.640 align:start position:0%
budget season it's going on now there's
 
00:51:44.109 --> 00:51:44.119 align:start position:0%
been many proposals for local tax caps
 
00:51:46.710 --> 00:51:46.720 align:start position:0%
and School District budget caps across
 
00:51:50.990 --> 00:51:51.000 align:start position:0%
the state and as as these are being used
 
00:51:54.030 --> 00:51:54.040 align:start position:0%
there's questions about um some of the
 
00:51:57.230 --> 00:51:57.240 align:start position:0%
references some of the uh RSA
 
00:51:59.990 --> 00:52:00.000 align:start position:0%
references and so the the purpose of
 
00:52:01.510 --> 00:52:01.520 align:start position:0%
this bill is to try to get the
 
00:52:03.870 --> 00:52:03.880 align:start position:0%
legislature to clarify the bill so that
 
00:52:06.829 --> 00:52:06.839 align:start position:0%
everybody has a common understanding of
 
00:52:10.309 --> 00:52:10.319 align:start position:0%
what the local tax cap does how it works
 
00:52:11.910 --> 00:52:11.920 align:start position:0%
and how's it how's it adopted and how is
 
00:52:15.990 --> 00:52:16.000 align:start position:0%
it supplied and similarly to the um
 
00:52:18.430 --> 00:52:18.440 align:start position:0%
School District budget cap the same the
 
00:52:23.230 --> 00:52:23.240 align:start position:0%
same uh challenge um notably there's um
 
00:52:25.670 --> 00:52:25.680 align:start position:0%
on row 10 of this table that was handed
 
00:52:28.670 --> 00:52:28.680 align:start position:0%
out there's a uh there was missing uh
 
00:52:32.150 --> 00:52:32.160 align:start position:0%
statutory language that being used uh
 
00:52:33.870 --> 00:52:33.880 align:start position:0%
that should that's being used but it's
 
00:52:37.270 --> 00:52:37.280 align:start position:0%
not in the law and that's important to
 
00:52:41.349 --> 00:52:41.359 align:start position:0%
add um there are also better references
 
00:52:44.549 --> 00:52:44.559 align:start position:0%
to what an what the uh admr is it
 
00:52:46.670 --> 00:52:46.680 align:start position:0%
actually references rsa1
 
00:52:49.069 --> 00:52:49.079 align:start position:0%
19838 so that people know where to look
 
00:52:52.829 --> 00:52:52.839 align:start position:0%
for that it it also clarifies how the
 
00:52:54.670 --> 00:52:54.680 align:start position:0%
under the School District budget cap how
 
00:52:57.710 --> 00:52:57.720 align:start position:0%
the current per people costs work
 
00:53:00.390 --> 00:53:00.400 align:start position:0%
some have interpreted it to be the uh
 
00:53:02.270 --> 00:53:02.280 align:start position:0%
the one reported by the Department of
 
00:53:04.069 --> 00:53:04.079 align:start position:0%
Education and this clarifies that it's
 
00:53:06.309 --> 00:53:06.319 align:start position:0%
not it's the one that's defined here in
 
00:53:09.230 --> 00:53:09.240 align:start position:0%
in the law um
 
00:53:12.470 --> 00:53:12.480 align:start position:0%
and it it does a few other important
 
00:53:14.670 --> 00:53:14.680 align:start position:0%
things uh one of the major things that
 
00:53:16.390 --> 00:53:16.400 align:start position:0%
came up with the school district budget
 
00:53:18.750 --> 00:53:18.760 align:start position:0%
cap is there in the budget season they
 
00:53:20.589 --> 00:53:20.599 align:start position:0%
the inflation index was tied to how it
 
00:53:23.670 --> 00:53:23.680 align:start position:0%
had changed as of January 1st turned out
 
00:53:25.630 --> 00:53:25.640 align:start position:0%
that did not be that was not the best
 
00:53:27.829 --> 00:53:27.839 align:start position:0%
date for that to make it October 1 made
 
00:53:29.309 --> 00:53:29.319 align:start position:0%
a lot more sense because that then you
 
00:53:32.190 --> 00:53:32.200 align:start position:0%
have the number by about mid October in
 
00:53:35.150 --> 00:53:35.160 align:start position:0%
order to plan your budgeting in
 
00:53:37.470 --> 00:53:37.480 align:start position:0%
compliance with the uh the new inflation
 
00:53:39.390 --> 00:53:39.400 align:start position:0%
based local tax cap or the School
 
00:53:41.069 --> 00:53:41.079 align:start position:0%
District budget cap so moving that to
 
00:53:43.829 --> 00:53:43.839 align:start position:0%
October 1st makes sense October 1st is
 
00:53:46.589 --> 00:53:46.599 align:start position:0%
also the date where the uh average daily
 
00:53:48.190 --> 00:53:48.200 align:start position:0%
membership in school districts is
 
00:53:50.990 --> 00:53:51.000 align:start position:0%
reported so it makes it more practical
 
00:53:52.789 --> 00:53:52.799 align:start position:0%
makes it easier for people to work
 
00:53:54.789 --> 00:53:54.799 align:start position:0%
there's at least uh one school district
 
00:53:57.950 --> 00:53:57.960 align:start position:0%
karge I believe that actually has a
 
00:54:01.309 --> 00:54:01.319 align:start position:0%
charter and they had their deliberative
 
00:54:03.549 --> 00:54:03.559 align:start position:0%
session like on the 3 of January so they
 
00:54:05.109 --> 00:54:05.119 align:start position:0%
didn't really have the number they
 
00:54:06.270 --> 00:54:06.280 align:start position:0%
haven't adopted the School District
 
00:54:08.030 --> 00:54:08.040 align:start position:0%
budget cap but if they were to it would
 
00:54:09.710 --> 00:54:09.720 align:start position:0%
be challenging they would they would
 
00:54:11.750 --> 00:54:11.760 align:start position:0%
have to figure that out so moving it
 
00:54:14.230 --> 00:54:14.240 align:start position:0%
back to October 1st helps everyone and
 
00:54:16.870 --> 00:54:16.880 align:start position:0%
makes things work very well I think
 
00:54:20.230 --> 00:54:20.240 align:start position:0%
these two bills um this bill that
 
00:54:22.150 --> 00:54:22.160 align:start position:0%
updates the local tax cap law and the
 
00:54:24.789 --> 00:54:24.799 align:start position:0%
School District budget cap law are very
 
00:54:27.230 --> 00:54:27.240 align:start position:0%
helpful for New Hampshire City
 
00:54:30.109 --> 00:54:30.119 align:start position:0%
uh excuse me towns and school districts
 
00:54:32.150 --> 00:54:32.160 align:start position:0%
and Village districts because I think it
 
00:54:34.750 --> 00:54:34.760 align:start position:0%
helps the voters put in some guard rails
 
00:54:36.349 --> 00:54:36.359 align:start position:0%
for spending and I think there's a
 
00:54:38.150 --> 00:54:38.160 align:start position:0%
concern across the state about the
 
00:54:40.789 --> 00:54:40.799 align:start position:0%
increase spending in both municipalities
 
00:54:43.510 --> 00:54:43.520 align:start position:0%
and school districts and this is a a
 
00:54:46.069 --> 00:54:46.079 align:start position:0%
good fiscal tool to help guide uh School
 
00:54:47.829 --> 00:54:47.839 align:start position:0%
boards select boards and budget
 
00:54:50.710 --> 00:54:50.720 align:start position:0%
committees to uh more sustainable
 
00:54:53.549 --> 00:54:53.559 align:start position:0%
budgets and we also do not want to
 
00:54:58.309 --> 00:54:58.319 align:start position:0%
create uh litigation among on um School
 
00:55:01.309 --> 00:55:01.319 align:start position:0%
among among governing bodies and and
 
00:55:03.870 --> 00:55:03.880 align:start position:0%
voters because of the law not being
 
00:55:05.750 --> 00:55:05.760 align:start position:0%
clear and that's the whole purpose of
 
00:55:07.589 --> 00:55:07.599 align:start position:0%
this is to avoid that so that it's very
 
00:55:09.549 --> 00:55:09.559 align:start position:0%
clear to everyone what the intent of the
 
00:55:12.190 --> 00:55:12.200 align:start position:0%
law is and how it works so for those
 
00:55:15.069 --> 00:55:15.079 align:start position:0%
reasons I recommend otpa on House Bill
 
00:55:17.789 --> 00:55:17.799 align:start position:0%
374 and I'll take any
 
00:55:20.190 --> 00:55:20.200 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Mr poers any
 
00:55:23.109 --> 00:55:23.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:25.230 --> 00:55:25.240 align:start position:0%

1020 and going to call the uh committee

01:21:43.189 --> 01:21:43.199 align:start position:0%
138 okay uh our first speaker will be uh
 
01:21:59.110 --> 01:21:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:01.030 --> 01:22:01.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and honorable
 
01:22:03.669 --> 01:22:03.679 align:start position:0%
committee members as the prime sponsor I
 
01:22:05.790 --> 01:22:05.800 align:start position:0%
appreciate the opportunity to introduce
 
01:22:09.669 --> 01:22:09.679 align:start position:0%
to you today House Bill 138 local for
 
01:22:11.550 --> 01:22:11.560 align:start position:0%
the record I am representative Diane
 
01:22:13.470 --> 01:22:13.480 align:start position:0%
power I represent the towns of Brook
 
01:22:15.470 --> 01:22:15.480 align:start position:0%
line Mason in Greenville in Hillsboro
 
01:22:17.590 --> 01:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
County District
 
01:22:20.709 --> 01:22:20.719 align:start position:0%
36 under current law enabling statute
 
01:22:23.110 --> 01:22:23.120 align:start position:0%
allows that the legislative body of a
 
01:22:26.510 --> 01:22:26.520 align:start position:0%
town or a school district District um
 
01:22:29.830 --> 01:22:29.840 align:start position:0%
may vote to require that a tax impact
 
01:22:32.790 --> 01:22:32.800 align:start position:0%
statement is included on every warrant
 
01:22:35.510 --> 01:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
article the tax impact statement is
 
01:22:37.590 --> 01:22:37.600 align:start position:0%
determined by the governing body and
 
01:22:42.830 --> 01:22:42.840 align:start position:0%
this is under RSA 32 budget preparation
 
01:22:45.910 --> 01:22:45.920 align:start position:0%
and the notation under current law need
 
01:22:49.709 --> 01:22:49.719 align:start position:0%
only state the tax impact for the
 
01:22:53.870 --> 01:22:53.880 align:start position:0%
upcoming fiscal year only while this is
 
01:22:56.270 --> 01:22:56.280 align:start position:0%
sufficient information for most warrant
 
01:22:59.790 --> 01:22:59.800 align:start position:0%
articles with one-year expenditures in
 
01:23:01.910 --> 01:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
the case of Warrant articles with
 
01:23:04.950 --> 01:23:04.960 align:start position:0%
multi-year expenditures the required
 
01:23:06.910 --> 01:23:06.920 align:start position:0%
information is
 
01:23:09.149 --> 01:23:09.159 align:start position:0%
incomplete moreover in the case of
 
01:23:11.590 --> 01:23:11.600 align:start position:0%
Warrant articles for bonds showing only
 
01:23:16.149 --> 01:23:16.159 align:start position:0%
the firste cost is especially incomplete
 
01:23:19.790 --> 01:23:19.800 align:start position:0%
since the firste costs and tax impacts
 
01:23:23.550 --> 01:23:23.560 align:start position:0%
are often quite small first year bond
 
01:23:26.510 --> 01:23:26.520 align:start position:0%
costs are typical partial year interest
 
01:23:29.390 --> 01:23:29.400 align:start position:0%
only payments and sometimes the first
 
01:23:32.669 --> 01:23:32.679 align:start position:0%
year costs are zero since payments may
 
01:23:36.629 --> 01:23:36.639 align:start position:0%
not start until the second year for
 
01:23:39.030 --> 01:23:39.040 align:start position:0%
example a recent School District bond
 
01:23:42.709 --> 01:23:42.719 align:start position:0%
warrant article listed a tax impact of 5
 
01:23:44.470 --> 01:23:44.480 align:start position:0%
cents per
 
01:23:47.790 --> 01:23:47.800 align:start position:0%
thousand and the taxpayers voted upon
 
01:23:50.510 --> 01:23:50.520 align:start position:0%
that Warren article in that Associated
 
01:23:53.709 --> 01:23:53.719 align:start position:0%
Tax impact information only to be
 
01:23:57.390 --> 01:23:57.400 align:start position:0%
surprised at a much higher cost for Bond
 
01:24:00.550 --> 01:24:00.560 align:start position:0%
payments in subsequent years so the
 
01:24:03.750 --> 01:24:03.760 align:start position:0%
solution is House Bill 138 which
 
01:24:07.030 --> 01:24:07.040 align:start position:0%
addresses this deficiency by simply
 
01:24:10.430 --> 01:24:10.440 align:start position:0%
requiring uh notations stating the
 
01:24:13.229 --> 01:24:13.239 align:start position:0%
estimated tax impact for any special
 
01:24:17.189 --> 01:24:17.199 align:start position:0%
warrant article with a multi-year tax
 
01:24:20.870 --> 01:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
impact or a warrant article that
 
01:24:23.189 --> 01:24:23.199 align:start position:0%
contains a lease agreement with a non
 
01:24:25.950 --> 01:24:25.960 align:start position:0%
appro without a non-appropriation
 
01:24:29.669 --> 01:24:29.679 align:start position:0%
clause for the first 5 years or for each
 
01:24:33.629 --> 01:24:33.639 align:start position:0%
year if the T tax impact is less than 5
 
01:24:36.629 --> 01:24:36.639 align:start position:0%
years so by including this information
 
01:24:40.149 --> 01:24:40.159 align:start position:0%
full disclosure in transparency is
 
01:24:42.430 --> 01:24:42.440 align:start position:0%
enhanced and available to the voters so
 
01:24:45.109 --> 01:24:45.119 align:start position:0%
that they can make a fully informed um
 
01:24:46.910 --> 01:24:46.920 align:start position:0%
decision on their
 
01:24:52.189 --> 01:24:52.199 align:start position:0%
vote um and this also affords the voters
 
01:24:55.550 --> 01:24:55.560 align:start position:0%
um information about both the near term
 
01:24:59.149 --> 01:24:59.159 align:start position:0%
as well as the long-term tax impacts of
 
01:25:01.030 --> 01:25:01.040 align:start position:0%
the warrant articles that they're voting
 
01:25:03.910 --> 01:25:03.920 align:start position:0%
on so for these reasons I urge the
 
01:25:07.109 --> 01:25:07.119 align:start position:0%
committee to recommend House Bill 138
 
01:25:09.950 --> 01:25:09.960 align:start position:0%
ought to pass that concludes my bill
 
01:25:12.030 --> 01:25:12.040 align:start position:0%
introduction Mr chairman and I'm happy
 
01:25:13.750 --> 01:25:13.760 align:start position:0%
to take
 
01:25:18.390 --> 01:25:18.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:21.750 --> 01:25:21.760 align:start position:0%
questions reference majority please I
 
01:25:24.149 --> 01:25:24.159 align:start position:0%
thought Dale was going to go thank you
 
01:25:25.510 --> 01:25:25.520 align:start position:0%
Mr Mr Vice chairman thank you for taking
 
01:25:28.950 --> 01:25:28.960 align:start position:0%
my question so uh I'm trying to figure
 
01:25:30.950 --> 01:25:30.960 align:start position:0%
out how the community is going to be
 
01:25:33.750 --> 01:25:33.760 align:start position:0%
able to assess the tax impact in year
 
01:25:35.629 --> 01:25:35.639 align:start position:0%
two three four or five when they don't
 
01:25:39.229 --> 01:25:39.239 align:start position:0%
know anything about revenues or uh the
 
01:25:41.270 --> 01:25:41.280 align:start position:0%
impacts of a revaluation which would
 
01:25:43.910 --> 01:25:43.920 align:start position:0%
have have to happen every five years so
 
01:25:46.430 --> 01:25:46.440 align:start position:0%
how could there be accuracy even though
 
01:25:48.510 --> 01:25:48.520 align:start position:0%
you say estimate how could there be any
 
01:25:51.109 --> 01:25:51.119 align:start position:0%
transparency to the community about what
 
01:25:53.870 --> 01:25:53.880 align:start position:0%
the impact will be thank you for the
 
01:25:55.950 --> 01:25:55.960 align:start position:0%
question representative as I said it it
 
01:25:58.109 --> 01:25:58.119 align:start position:0%
is an estimate based on the information
 
01:26:01.030 --> 01:26:01.040 align:start position:0%
that they do have and I think that that
 
01:26:04.109 --> 01:26:04.119 align:start position:0%
whatever not whatever I think that the
 
01:26:06.750 --> 01:26:06.760 align:start position:0%
information that can be provided and
 
01:26:09.790 --> 01:26:09.800 align:start position:0%
printed on the warrant is far
 
01:26:12.510 --> 01:26:12.520 align:start position:0%
superior um knowing that it's that's
 
01:26:15.709 --> 01:26:15.719 align:start position:0%
that it is an estimate it's far superior
 
01:26:18.510 --> 01:26:18.520 align:start position:0%
than no information at all so I
 
01:26:20.709 --> 01:26:20.719 align:start position:0%
personally don't see a problem with that
 
01:26:23.709 --> 01:26:23.719 align:start position:0%
because it is an estimate and there
 
01:26:27.229 --> 01:26:27.239 align:start position:0%
there are um while it is not you know
 
01:26:29.950 --> 01:26:29.960 align:start position:0%
specific and locked in stone there is
 
01:26:32.629 --> 01:26:32.639 align:start position:0%
information that that that is available
 
01:26:35.669 --> 01:26:35.679 align:start position:0%
that can guide like the example that I
 
01:26:38.229 --> 01:26:38.239 align:start position:0%
gave you know the 5 cents per thousand
 
01:26:40.750 --> 01:26:40.760 align:start position:0%
in the first year and then the 31 cents
 
01:26:44.109 --> 01:26:44.119 align:start position:0%
I mean that's a huge huge jump and you
 
01:26:46.550 --> 01:26:46.560 align:start position:0%
know PE the the voters did not have that
 
01:26:49.070 --> 01:26:49.080 align:start position:0%
information and there is information
 
01:26:51.470 --> 01:26:51.480 align:start position:0%
that that's available that can um serve
 
01:26:51.480 --> 01:26:52.990 align:start position:0%
that that's available that can um serve
to

01:26:52.990 --> 01:26:53.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:26:57.870 --> 01:26:57.880 align:start position:0%
inform um what the tax impact may be
 
01:27:01.350 --> 01:27:01.360 align:start position:0%
moving forward but to be clear when you
 
01:27:04.669 --> 01:27:04.679 align:start position:0%
have a warrant at any annual meeting
 
01:27:07.910 --> 01:27:07.920 align:start position:0%
you're voting on the information at that
 
01:27:09.950 --> 01:27:09.960 align:start position:0%
time so that's what that that's what
 
01:27:13.430 --> 01:27:13.440 align:start position:0%
you're voting on um like I said at that
 
01:27:17.430 --> 01:27:17.440 align:start position:0%
annual meeting so so like I the
 
01:27:19.550 --> 01:27:19.560 align:start position:0%
information that I'm asking that this
 
01:27:22.189 --> 01:27:22.199 align:start position:0%
bill provide is you know future
 
01:27:24.470 --> 01:27:24.480 align:start position:0%
information to to help to inform the
 
01:27:28.149 --> 01:27:28.159 align:start position:0%
bigger picture and but again to
 
01:27:31.189 --> 01:27:31.199 align:start position:0%
reiterate you're voting on the
 
01:27:33.950 --> 01:27:33.960 align:start position:0%
information for that year and that is
 
01:27:37.990 --> 01:27:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:40.709 --> 01:27:40.719 align:start position:0%
known thank you uh representative gr
 
01:27:42.830 --> 01:27:42.840 align:start position:0%
please thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:27:46.790 --> 01:27:46.800 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um so I I I do
 
01:27:49.550 --> 01:27:49.560 align:start position:0%
have a concern about the a similar thing
 
01:27:54.390 --> 01:27:54.400 align:start position:0%
so the expense side the cost side of the
 
01:27:57.590 --> 01:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
next 5 years can be estimated with
 
01:27:59.030 --> 01:27:59.040 align:start position:0%
pretty pretty close to factual
 
01:28:01.709 --> 01:28:01.719 align:start position:0%
information like on a bond we would know
 
01:28:03.910 --> 01:28:03.920 align:start position:0%
it's an estimate still because the bond
 
01:28:05.550 --> 01:28:05.560 align:start position:0%
we don't know the actual cost until the
 
01:28:07.870 --> 01:28:07.880 align:start position:0%
bonds are actually sold after the voters
 
01:28:10.350 --> 01:28:10.360 align:start position:0%
approve the bond anyway but we could at
 
01:28:12.229 --> 01:28:12.239 align:start position:0%
least estimate those expenses better
 
01:28:15.229 --> 01:28:15.239 align:start position:0%
than a tax rate which would include um
 
01:28:18.590 --> 01:28:18.600 align:start position:0%
revenues changes in town valuations admr
 
01:28:20.270 --> 01:28:20.280 align:start position:0%
those sorts unassigned fund balance that
 
01:28:21.910 --> 01:28:21.920 align:start position:0%
may be returned to the taxpayer can
 
01:28:24.910 --> 01:28:24.920 align:start position:0%
influence tax rates up and down
 
01:28:28.070 --> 01:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
would you be opposed to an amending this
 
01:28:31.109 --> 01:28:31.119 align:start position:0%
that would put the expense amount versus
 
01:28:33.750 --> 01:28:33.760 align:start position:0%
the tax rate
 
01:28:36.470 --> 01:28:36.480 align:start position:0%
amount thank you representative um for
 
01:28:41.430 --> 01:28:41.440 align:start position:0%
your question so as as we know that um
 
01:28:43.109 --> 01:28:43.119 align:start position:0%
when a bill is introduced it belongs to
 
01:28:45.870 --> 01:28:45.880 align:start position:0%
the committee and I'm certainly open to
 
01:28:48.390 --> 01:28:48.400 align:start position:0%
um discussions with regards to
 
01:28:50.590 --> 01:28:50.600 align:start position:0%
amendments to make the bill more
 
01:28:53.709 --> 01:28:53.719 align:start position:0%
satisfactory to to the committee and I
 
01:28:56.910 --> 01:28:56.920 align:start position:0%
would also note that there's a bill um
 
01:28:59.030 --> 01:28:59.040 align:start position:0%
that's going to be heard after this
 
01:29:01.870 --> 01:29:01.880 align:start position:0%
which does have an amendment that um you
 
01:29:04.310 --> 01:29:04.320 align:start position:0%
might want to take a a look
 
01:29:07.030 --> 01:29:07.040 align:start position:0%
at um but then I I would also just
 
01:29:09.550 --> 01:29:09.560 align:start position:0%
simply reiterate what I my response to
 
01:29:12.830 --> 01:29:12.840 align:start position:0%
representative majority in that you know
 
01:29:15.070 --> 01:29:15.080 align:start position:0%
the information that you're voting on on
 
01:29:17.750 --> 01:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
the warrant at that time is for that
 
01:29:20.430 --> 01:29:20.440 align:start position:0%
year and I feel that we do have
 
01:29:22.510 --> 01:29:22.520 align:start position:0%
sufficient information and then in
 
01:29:22.520 --> 01:29:24.510 align:start position:0%
sufficient information and then in
subsequent

01:29:24.510 --> 01:29:24.520 align:start position:0%
subsequent
 
01:29:28.030 --> 01:29:28.040 align:start position:0%
well depends on the item it would maybe
 
01:29:29.750 --> 01:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
it would come become part of the
 
01:29:32.310 --> 01:29:32.320 align:start position:0%
operating budget but again some
 
01:29:36.750 --> 01:29:36.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:39.430 --> 01:29:39.440 align:start position:0%
information representative
 
01:29:41.709 --> 01:29:41.719 align:start position:0%
Murphy thank you Mr Vice chair thank you
 
01:29:45.270 --> 01:29:45.280 align:start position:0%
for taking my question why just special
 
01:29:47.109 --> 01:29:47.119 align:start position:0%
Warren articles why not all Warren
 
01:29:49.430 --> 01:29:49.440 align:start position:0%
articles because you have some towns
 
01:29:53.270 --> 01:29:53.280 align:start position:0%
will have a water a sewer uh bill that
 
01:29:55.950 --> 01:29:55.960 align:start position:0%
goes that goes under the warrant and
 
01:29:58.310 --> 01:29:58.320 align:start position:0%
they don't have uh the impact statement
 
01:30:00.390 --> 01:30:00.400 align:start position:0%
at all what the percentage of rate
 
01:30:02.790 --> 01:30:02.800 align:start position:0%
increase over year over year they just
 
01:30:04.950 --> 01:30:04.960 align:start position:0%
put down this is what we're looking
 
01:30:09.590 --> 01:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
for and why not do the same thing with
 
01:30:11.709 --> 01:30:11.719 align:start position:0%
all war articles why just pick pick
 
01:30:15.790 --> 01:30:15.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:18.109 --> 01:30:18.119 align:start position:0%
have thank you for the question um
 
01:30:21.390 --> 01:30:21.400 align:start position:0%
representative I'm I I missed a detail
 
01:30:23.709 --> 01:30:23.719 align:start position:0%
but I I'll give you might need to ask a
 
01:30:26.910 --> 01:30:26.920 align:start position:0%
follow question so um a special warrant
 
01:30:28.709 --> 01:30:28.719 align:start position:0%
article there are five types I'm not
 
01:30:31.950 --> 01:30:31.960 align:start position:0%
sure if you're aware of that and so I
 
01:30:34.870 --> 01:30:34.880 align:start position:0%
didn't memorize these yet but it is a
 
01:30:36.790 --> 01:30:36.800 align:start position:0%
warrant article that's submitted by
 
01:30:39.470 --> 01:30:39.480 align:start position:0%
petition or a warrant article that calls
 
01:30:41.510 --> 01:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
for an appropriation of an amount to be
 
01:30:43.830 --> 01:30:43.840 align:start position:0%
raised by the issuance of a bond or a
 
01:30:47.950 --> 01:30:47.960 align:start position:0%
note it would also is a speci spe
 
01:30:49.669 --> 01:30:49.679 align:start position:0%
special warrant article calls for an
 
01:30:52.430 --> 01:30:52.440 align:start position:0%
appropriation to or FR from a separate
 
01:30:55.830 --> 01:30:55.840 align:start position:0%
fund created pursuant to statute
 
01:30:57.910 --> 01:30:57.920 align:start position:0%
including but not limited to a capital
 
01:31:01.750 --> 01:31:01.760 align:start position:0%
reserve fund or under RSA 35 or a trust
 
01:31:05.350 --> 01:31:05.360 align:start position:0%
fund and um also a special warrant
 
01:31:07.790 --> 01:31:07.800 align:start position:0%
article is des is designated in the
 
01:31:10.229 --> 01:31:10.239 align:start position:0%
warrant by the governing body as
 
01:31:13.310 --> 01:31:13.320 align:start position:0%
special or as a non-aps or
 
01:31:15.510 --> 01:31:15.520 align:start position:0%
non-transferable appropriation and then
 
01:31:18.629 --> 01:31:18.639 align:start position:0%
finally a special warrant article calls
 
01:31:21.310 --> 01:31:21.320 align:start position:0%
for an appropriation of an amount for a
 
01:31:24.629 --> 01:31:24.639 align:start position:0%
capital project under stat statute so
 
01:31:28.189 --> 01:31:28.199 align:start position:0%
I'm not I I missed the detail as to what
 
01:31:31.350 --> 01:31:31.360 align:start position:0%
type of a warrant article you were um
 
01:31:34.669 --> 01:31:34.679 align:start position:0%
specifying in your question and I I I
 
01:31:37.189 --> 01:31:37.199 align:start position:0%
wonder if that would fall under what I
 
01:31:37.199 --> 01:31:37.950 align:start position:0%
wonder if that would fall under what I
just

01:31:37.950 --> 01:31:37.960 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:31:43.189 --> 01:31:43.199 align:start position:0%
described a followup go ahead I have a a
 
01:31:44.990 --> 01:31:45.000 align:start position:0%
warrant article here shall the town of
 
01:31:46.629 --> 01:31:46.639 align:start position:0%
winest are raise an appropriate in
 
01:31:48.189 --> 01:31:48.199 align:start position:0%
operating budget not to include
 
01:31:49.550 --> 01:31:49.560 align:start position:0%
Appropriations by special warrant
 
01:31:52.629 --> 01:31:52.639 align:start position:0%
articles x amount of dollars I'm just
 
01:31:54.750 --> 01:31:54.760 align:start position:0%
curious whether that would be
 
01:31:57.030 --> 01:31:57.040 align:start position:0%
have that type of wording that your for
 
01:32:00.149 --> 01:32:00.159 align:start position:0%
this your uh 138 whether or not that
 
01:32:01.550 --> 01:32:01.560 align:start position:0%
should be on there
 
01:32:04.310 --> 01:32:04.320 align:start position:0%
also so the question is would would an
 
01:32:07.310 --> 01:32:07.320 align:start position:0%
operating budget have that right this is
 
01:32:09.510 --> 01:32:09.520 align:start position:0%
for you know be able to have an impact
 
01:32:11.070 --> 01:32:11.080 align:start position:0%
statement on that you know what the
 
01:32:13.830 --> 01:32:13.840 align:start position:0%
percentage of increase
 
01:32:17.750 --> 01:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:21.189 --> 01:32:21.199 align:start position:0%
us so in in the current statute as you
 
01:32:23.950 --> 01:32:23.960 align:start position:0%
can see on on the bill it says any town
 
01:32:25.629 --> 01:32:25.639 align:start position:0%
may vote to require that the annual
 
01:32:27.229 --> 01:32:27.239 align:start position:0%
budget would then that would be the
 
01:32:32.669 --> 01:32:32.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:35.629 --> 01:32:35.639 align:start position:0%
articles so that okay so this excuse me
 
01:32:40.510 --> 01:32:40.520 align:start position:0%
shall have a tax impact do you have
 
01:32:43.109 --> 01:32:43.119 align:start position:0%
followup I I do but I don't know what
 
01:32:44.280 --> 01:32:44.290 align:start position:0%
the question
 
01:32:44.290 --> 01:32:45.750 align:start position:0%
the question
[Music]

01:32:45.750 --> 01:32:45.760 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:32:48.950 --> 01:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
is yeah I'm I'm this is all a little
 
01:32:50.830 --> 01:32:50.840 align:start position:0%
confusing okay we'll move on and give
 
01:32:53.070 --> 01:32:53.080 align:start position:0%
you some time to think it over uh repr
 
01:32:56.669 --> 01:32:56.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:58.149 --> 01:32:58.159 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:33:01.310 --> 01:33:01.320 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh isn't this
 
01:33:04.189 --> 01:33:04.199 align:start position:0%
information available to the public
 
01:33:07.470 --> 01:33:07.480 align:start position:0%
during the regular budget process I mean
 
01:33:09.910 --> 01:33:09.920 align:start position:0%
I know I understand I'm trying to
 
01:33:11.950 --> 01:33:11.960 align:start position:0%
understand the VA the real value of
 
01:33:14.950 --> 01:33:14.960 align:start position:0%
putting it actually on the on the
 
01:33:17.310 --> 01:33:17.320 align:start position:0%
article is that because you feel that
 
01:33:21.030 --> 01:33:21.040 align:start position:0%
the uh whoever is voting doesn't pay
 
01:33:23.430 --> 01:33:23.440 align:start position:0%
attention until they come to the polls
 
01:33:26.149 --> 01:33:26.159 align:start position:0%
or what is the reason from adding this
 
01:33:29.189 --> 01:33:29.199 align:start position:0%
in addition to the information as family
 
01:33:32.109 --> 01:33:32.119 align:start position:0%
that's available to the the vter during
 
01:33:34.910 --> 01:33:34.920 align:start position:0%
the regular budget process thank you for
 
01:33:38.990 --> 01:33:39.000 align:start position:0%
the question representative so um for
 
01:33:42.790 --> 01:33:42.800 align:start position:0%
those towns or school districts that um
 
01:33:46.109 --> 01:33:46.119 align:start position:0%
this information is provided during any
 
01:33:48.550 --> 01:33:48.560 align:start position:0%
budgeting process or at any annual
 
01:33:51.629 --> 01:33:51.639 align:start position:0%
meeting uh you're very lucky that that's
 
01:33:54.550 --> 01:33:54.560 align:start position:0%
fantastic I've lived in my town for 31
 
01:33:58.790 --> 01:33:58.800 align:start position:0%
years and sadly over those decades the
 
01:34:02.189 --> 01:34:02.199 align:start position:0%
amount of information that is uh
 
01:34:05.990 --> 01:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
shared with the voters at any of these
 
01:34:08.669 --> 01:34:08.679 align:start position:0%
um hearings public meetings annual
 
01:34:13.510 --> 01:34:13.520 align:start position:0%
meetings is less and less every year so
 
01:34:15.750 --> 01:34:15.760 align:start position:0%
this is a matter of transparency and
 
01:34:20.030 --> 01:34:20.040 align:start position:0%
full disclosure and um
 
01:34:22.870 --> 01:34:22.880 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we it's something that
 
01:34:25.109 --> 01:34:25.119 align:start position:0%
that is not being done across the state
 
01:34:27.270 --> 01:34:27.280 align:start position:0%
and it's important and it's it's a
 
01:34:31.229 --> 01:34:31.239 align:start position:0%
simple it's a simple requirement so as I
 
01:34:34.629 --> 01:34:34.639 align:start position:0%
said um governing bodies currently May
 
01:34:37.390 --> 01:34:37.400 align:start position:0%
optionally provide this information and
 
01:34:42.149 --> 01:34:42.159 align:start position:0%
if they do again fantastic that's great
 
01:34:44.790 --> 01:34:44.800 align:start position:0%
th those um those towns or school
 
01:34:46.990 --> 01:34:47.000 align:start position:0%
districts are very fortunate to to have
 
01:34:50.430 --> 01:34:50.440 align:start position:0%
that um but also law provides that a
 
01:34:54.430 --> 01:34:54.440 align:start position:0%
legislative body may vote to require ire
 
01:34:57.629 --> 01:34:57.639 align:start position:0%
this type of um tax in Impact
 
01:35:00.790 --> 01:35:00.800 align:start position:0%
information to be printed on the warrant
 
01:35:00.800 --> 01:35:01.830 align:start position:0%
information to be printed on the warrant
and

01:35:01.830 --> 01:35:01.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:35:04.870 --> 01:35:04.880 align:start position:0%
um I hope that answers your question yes
 
01:35:09.030 --> 01:35:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:12.390 --> 01:35:12.400 align:start position:0%
much representa Davis
 
01:35:14.870 --> 01:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
please thank you Mr Vice chair and thank
 
01:35:16.270 --> 01:35:16.280 align:start position:0%
you for taking my
 
01:35:20.470 --> 01:35:20.480 align:start position:0%
question uh so you just stated that in
 
01:35:22.510 --> 01:35:22.520 align:start position:0%
your town there's less and less
 
01:35:25.070 --> 01:35:25.080 align:start position:0%
information every year and hence the
 
01:35:28.229 --> 01:35:28.239 align:start position:0%
need for this this committee has
 
01:35:28.239 --> 01:35:30.030 align:start position:0%
need for this this committee has
traditionally

01:35:30.030 --> 01:35:30.040 align:start position:0%
traditionally
 
01:35:30.040 --> 01:35:31.790 align:start position:0%
traditionally
avoided

01:35:31.790 --> 01:35:31.800 align:start position:0%
avoided
 
01:35:31.800 --> 01:35:33.629 align:start position:0%
avoided
supporting

01:35:33.629 --> 01:35:33.639 align:start position:0%
supporting
 
01:35:36.629 --> 01:35:36.639 align:start position:0%
bills that are the problem of one town
 
01:35:38.830 --> 01:35:38.840 align:start position:0%
or a couple of
 
01:35:41.229 --> 01:35:41.239 align:start position:0%
towns because they will end up being a
 
01:35:43.709 --> 01:35:43.719 align:start position:0%
mandate Statewide in those in those
 
01:35:46.070 --> 01:35:46.080 align:start position:0%
towns and cities that are not
 
01:35:48.390 --> 01:35:48.400 align:start position:0%
transgressing in the way that you are
 
01:35:50.950 --> 01:35:50.960 align:start position:0%
saying so can you can you tell me if you
 
01:35:54.350 --> 01:35:54.360 align:start position:0%
have any specific data on how how many
 
01:35:56.830 --> 01:35:56.840 align:start position:0%
towns and cities are not providing
 
01:35:59.229 --> 01:35:59.239 align:start position:0%
sufficient information such as what
 
01:36:01.229 --> 01:36:01.239 align:start position:0%
would be required in this Bill thank you
 
01:36:02.470 --> 01:36:02.480 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for your
 
01:36:05.510 --> 01:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
question and I I absolutely do agree
 
01:36:07.510 --> 01:36:07.520 align:start position:0%
that making
 
01:36:13.030 --> 01:36:13.040 align:start position:0%
or making laws for just one data point
 
01:36:17.709 --> 01:36:17.719 align:start position:0%
is is not what we should be doing so I
 
01:36:21.229 --> 01:36:21.239 align:start position:0%
gave that as an example because I live
 
01:36:23.270 --> 01:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
you know that's my lived experience and
 
01:36:26.350 --> 01:36:26.360 align:start position:0%
I shared that as an example as to why
 
01:36:29.109 --> 01:36:29.119 align:start position:0%
this bill is needed I this is my third
 
01:36:33.229 --> 01:36:33.239 align:start position:0%
term as a state rep and I Network and
 
01:36:35.709 --> 01:36:35.719 align:start position:0%
interact with state representatives from
 
01:36:39.910 --> 01:36:39.920 align:start position:0%
across the state and I constantly and
 
01:36:42.350 --> 01:36:42.360 align:start position:0%
repeatedly have conversations where
 
01:36:45.629 --> 01:36:45.639 align:start position:0%
people um complain about this very issue
 
01:36:50.229 --> 01:36:50.239 align:start position:0%
and I did not keep a log of those um
 
01:36:54.430 --> 01:36:54.440 align:start position:0%
Communications nor did did I ask um OS
 
01:36:56.750 --> 01:36:56.760 align:start position:0%
research to to research this sort of
 
01:37:01.189 --> 01:37:01.199 align:start position:0%
thing but to be clear um we already have
 
01:37:03.950 --> 01:37:03.960 align:start position:0%
the this provision in law so it's not
 
01:37:06.750 --> 01:37:06.760 align:start position:0%
something totally brand new it's simply
 
01:37:09.189 --> 01:37:09.199 align:start position:0%
saying that
 
01:37:09.199 --> 01:37:11.709 align:start position:0%
saying that
um

01:37:11.709 --> 01:37:11.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:15.310 --> 01:37:15.320 align:start position:0%
for towns or school districts that that
 
01:37:18.990 --> 01:37:19.000 align:start position:0%
have voted to to do this to provide tax
 
01:37:22.990 --> 01:37:23.000 align:start position:0%
impacts that the information shall not
 
01:37:25.430 --> 01:37:25.440 align:start position:0%
the current law only has like for for
 
01:37:30.990 --> 01:37:31.000 align:start position:0%
that year all I'm asking is if the tax
 
01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:32.790 align:start position:0%
that year all I'm asking is if the tax
impact

01:37:32.790 --> 01:37:32.800 align:start position:0%
impact
 
01:37:35.350 --> 01:37:35.360 align:start position:0%
is up to five years that that
 
01:37:36.870 --> 01:37:36.880 align:start position:0%
information be
 
01:37:39.589 --> 01:37:39.599 align:start position:0%
included so it's not um this is not
 
01:37:42.990 --> 01:37:43.000 align:start position:0%
anything that's new this is adding on
 
01:37:45.750 --> 01:37:45.760 align:start position:0%
and making more complete the
 
01:37:49.629 --> 01:37:49.639 align:start position:0%
information that is already um enabled
 
01:37:56.910 --> 01:37:56.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:00.109 --> 01:38:00.119 align:start position:0%
thank you representative any other
 
01:38:02.109 --> 01:38:02.119 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for
 
01:38:05.270 --> 01:38:05.280 align:start position:0%
coming in appreciate it thank you our
 
01:38:07.709 --> 01:38:07.719 align:start position:0%
next speaker will be uh Mr Brody desay
 
01:38:17.830 --> 01:38:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:19.950 --> 01:38:19.960 align:start position:0%
Association thank you Mr Vice chairman
 
01:38:21.109 --> 01:38:21.119 align:start position:0%
and uh thank you to the committee for
 
01:38:22.830 --> 01:38:22.840 align:start position:0%
letting me speak again today uh my name
 
01:38:24.910 --> 01:38:24.920 align:start position:0%
is birie I represent the New Hampshire
 
01:38:28.030 --> 01:38:28.040 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association and um we are a
 
01:38:30.629 --> 01:38:30.639 align:start position:0%
posos to House Bill 138 is currently
 
01:38:33.229 --> 01:38:33.239 align:start position:0%
written um House Bill 138 mandates a
 
01:38:35.510 --> 01:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
change in voter adopted estimated tax
 
01:38:37.790 --> 01:38:37.800 align:start position:0%
impact notations on warn articles and
 
01:38:39.669 --> 01:38:39.679 align:start position:0%
overrides the legislative bodies uh
 
01:38:41.709 --> 01:38:41.719 align:start position:0%
previous votes um it requires that
 
01:38:43.229 --> 01:38:43.239 align:start position:0%
special warrant articles with multi-year
 
01:38:44.990 --> 01:38:45.000 align:start position:0%
tax impacts or lease agreements not the
 
01:38:47.830 --> 01:38:47.840 align:start position:0%
tax impact for up to 5 years obviously
 
01:38:49.750 --> 01:38:49.760 align:start position:0%
if the um if the agreement is shorter
 
01:38:51.070 --> 01:38:51.080 align:start position:0%
than 5 years then it wouldn't list
 
01:38:52.910 --> 01:38:52.920 align:start position:0%
longer than 5 years sorry it wouldn't
 
01:38:54.870 --> 01:38:54.880 align:start position:0%
list longer than than the U the duration
 
01:38:57.070 --> 01:38:57.080 align:start position:0%
of the agreement um estimated tax
 
01:38:59.390 --> 01:38:59.400 align:start position:0%
impacts can't be always done accurately
 
01:39:01.910 --> 01:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
for multiple years because of tax rate
 
01:39:04.669 --> 01:39:04.679 align:start position:0%
changes due to updated assessed property
 
01:39:07.070 --> 01:39:07.080 align:start position:0%
values and changes in unreserved fund
 
01:39:08.669 --> 01:39:08.679 align:start position:0%
balances that will decrease the tax
 
01:39:10.189 --> 01:39:10.199 align:start position:0%
rates some of you asked some questions
 
01:39:12.589 --> 01:39:12.599 align:start position:0%
and kind of stole my testimony from me
 
01:39:14.390 --> 01:39:14.400 align:start position:0%
um in asking those things but that's a
 
01:39:16.350 --> 01:39:16.360 align:start position:0%
that really does impact your tax rat so
 
01:39:17.589 --> 01:39:17.599 align:start position:0%
when you're trying to create a
 
01:39:20.830 --> 01:39:20.840 align:start position:0%
multi-year 5-year um notation it doesn't
 
01:39:23.669 --> 01:39:23.679 align:start position:0%
show an accuracy in what the tax rate
 
01:39:25.390 --> 01:39:25.400 align:start position:0%
might be especially if you do an entire
 
01:39:27.990 --> 01:39:28.000 align:start position:0%
reassessment of your um Community
 
01:39:29.870 --> 01:39:29.880 align:start position:0%
additionally Bond rates can change over
 
01:39:32.070 --> 01:39:32.080 align:start position:0%
a multi-year period which could increase
 
01:39:34.109 --> 01:39:34.119 align:start position:0%
or decrease ESP warrant articles cost
 
01:39:36.830 --> 01:39:36.840 align:start position:0%
per year so not only um do the rates
 
01:39:39.350 --> 01:39:39.360 align:start position:0%
change even after you've approved the uh
 
01:39:41.189 --> 01:39:41.199 align:start position:0%
bonded you know the the worn article to
 
01:39:44.149 --> 01:39:44.159 align:start position:0%
go out for Bond um you may refinance um
 
01:39:45.790 --> 01:39:45.800 align:start position:0%
and also the amount of years that you go
 
01:39:47.910 --> 01:39:47.920 align:start position:0%
out to finance um that can also impact
 
01:39:50.510 --> 01:39:50.520 align:start position:0%
the interest rates too um tax rate
 
01:39:52.430 --> 01:39:52.440 align:start position:0%
impacts give an imperfect picture of a
 
01:39:54.750 --> 01:39:54.760 align:start position:0%
warant articles to cost and only
 
01:39:56.229 --> 01:39:56.239 align:start position:0%
consider the information collected
 
01:39:59.149 --> 01:39:59.159 align:start position:0%
before the warrant article's approval so
 
01:40:01.310 --> 01:40:01.320 align:start position:0%
without that additional context after
 
01:40:03.149 --> 01:40:03.159 align:start position:0%
when the municipality goes out um
 
01:40:04.550 --> 01:40:04.560 align:start position:0%
whether it's for a bond or when they
 
01:40:07.310 --> 01:40:07.320 align:start position:0%
negotiate the lease you you know the
 
01:40:09.910 --> 01:40:09.920 align:start position:0%
rate and the cost to the taxpayers can
 
01:40:12.910 --> 01:40:12.920 align:start position:0%
change um you still may not know the
 
01:40:14.229 --> 01:40:14.239 align:start position:0%
expense amount because you won't know
 
01:40:15.550 --> 01:40:15.560 align:start position:0%
the terms of the bond like the interest
 
01:40:16.750 --> 01:40:16.760 align:start position:0%
rate in the principal you know the
 
01:40:17.950 --> 01:40:17.960 align:start position:0%
principal can change you can go out to
 
01:40:19.149 --> 01:40:19.159 align:start position:0%
bond for up to the amount that the
 
01:40:20.790 --> 01:40:20.800 align:start position:0%
voters approv but often times
 
01:40:22.629 --> 01:40:22.639 align:start position:0%
municipalities they may get grants to
 
01:40:24.350 --> 01:40:24.360 align:start position:0%
make decrease the the amount of the bond
 
01:40:25.990 --> 01:40:26.000 align:start position:0%
um especially for a large infrastructure
 
01:40:28.430 --> 01:40:28.440 align:start position:0%
pro project or they may find someone who
 
01:40:32.629 --> 01:40:32.639 align:start position:0%
is a better bidder to do the project
 
01:40:36.310 --> 01:40:36.320 align:start position:0%
um they also um leases are fixed so that
 
01:40:38.589 --> 01:40:38.599 align:start position:0%
we can um you know we can agree that you
 
01:40:40.070 --> 01:40:40.080 align:start position:0%
know a fixed lease if you do like a
 
01:40:41.990 --> 01:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
10-year lease on let's say a piece of
 
01:40:44.109 --> 01:40:44.119 align:start position:0%
Fire Equipment um that's going to be a
 
01:40:45.990 --> 01:40:46.000 align:start position:0%
fixed cost that's not going to change so
 
01:40:47.990 --> 01:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
in that in that respect at least you
 
01:40:50.030 --> 01:40:50.040 align:start position:0%
know what the fixed cost is but again
 
01:40:52.070 --> 01:40:52.080 align:start position:0%
after reassessments over that period and
 
01:40:53.990 --> 01:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
you'd be mandated to at least two in
 
01:40:56.109 --> 01:40:56.119 align:start position:0%
your municipality most do it more
 
01:40:58.149 --> 01:40:58.159 align:start position:0%
frequently though um the tax rat's going
 
01:40:59.589 --> 01:40:59.599 align:start position:0%
to change again on how much you're
 
01:41:01.629 --> 01:41:01.639 align:start position:0%
paying for that lease um and we believe
 
01:41:04.109 --> 01:41:04.119 align:start position:0%
that this is probably best as a local
 
01:41:05.830 --> 01:41:05.840 align:start position:0%
option where the legislative body can
 
01:41:08.030 --> 01:41:08.040 align:start position:0%
require this additional information so
 
01:41:10.430 --> 01:41:10.440 align:start position:0%
the concept of legislative bodies
 
01:41:12.669 --> 01:41:12.679 align:start position:0%
requiring the governing body to provide
 
01:41:14.470 --> 01:41:14.480 align:start position:0%
multi-year tax impacts it's not
 
01:41:16.030 --> 01:41:16.040 align:start position:0%
something we're opposed to it's about
 
01:41:17.430 --> 01:41:17.440 align:start position:0%
ultimately it should be up to the
 
01:41:20.030 --> 01:41:20.040 align:start position:0%
legislative body to decide so we believe
 
01:41:21.510 --> 01:41:21.520 align:start position:0%
that this bill would be better done as
 
01:41:24.070 --> 01:41:24.080 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation um and for the
 
01:41:25.990 --> 01:41:26.000 align:start position:0%
voters to to deliberate and decide
 
01:41:27.390 --> 01:41:27.400 align:start position:0%
whether or not to adopt this whether or
 
01:41:29.310 --> 01:41:29.320 align:start position:0%
not this information is more accurate
 
01:41:31.310 --> 01:41:31.320 align:start position:0%
helps them make a more informed choice
 
01:41:33.589 --> 01:41:33.599 align:start position:0%
in the voting booth or a town meeting um
 
01:41:36.790 --> 01:41:36.800 align:start position:0%
and with that I'll take any
 
01:41:39.990 --> 01:41:40.000 align:start position:0%
questions any questions Mr
 
01:41:42.870 --> 01:41:42.880 align:start position:0%
Des representative
 
01:41:45.070 --> 01:41:45.080 align:start position:0%
stavis thank you and thanks for taking
 
01:41:47.709 --> 01:41:47.719 align:start position:0%
my question this bill does say or
 
01:41:49.350 --> 01:41:49.360 align:start position:0%
actually current law
 
01:41:53.669 --> 01:41:53.679 align:start position:0%
states uh a town may vote
 
01:41:56.750 --> 01:41:56.760 align:start position:0%
so how is it not already enabling if you
 
01:41:59.550 --> 01:41:59.560 align:start position:0%
go to section two it says as amended by
 
01:42:01.189 --> 01:42:01.199 align:start position:0%
section one of this act shall apply to
 
01:42:02.669 --> 01:42:02.679 align:start position:0%
any town or District that has adopted
 
01:42:04.750 --> 01:42:04.760 align:start position:0%
the requirement to include a no notation
 
01:42:06.870 --> 01:42:06.880 align:start position:0%
stating the estimated tax impact of the
 
01:42:08.470 --> 01:42:08.480 align:start position:0%
annual budget and special warant
 
01:42:10.030 --> 01:42:10.040 align:start position:0%
articles and shall not require local
 
01:42:12.229 --> 01:42:12.239 align:start position:0%
Amendment or read-option by the town or
 
01:42:15.430 --> 01:42:15.440 align:start position:0%
District um right now it's only one year
 
01:42:16.830 --> 01:42:16.840 align:start position:0%
this would mandate that every
 
01:42:19.270 --> 01:42:19.280 align:start position:0%
municipality that does the estimated tax
 
01:42:20.550 --> 01:42:20.560 align:start position:0%
impact for the first year that they have
 
01:42:22.510 --> 01:42:22.520 align:start position:0%
to do it for 5 years we think that it
 
01:42:24.270 --> 01:42:24.280 align:start position:0%
should be enabling legislation that if
 
01:42:25.470 --> 01:42:25.480 align:start position:0%
you're going to require a longer
 
01:42:27.390 --> 01:42:27.400 align:start position:0%
duration of the tax impact that the
 
01:42:29.510 --> 01:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
legislative body should have to approve
 
01:42:29.520 --> 01:42:31.189 align:start position:0%
legislative body should have to approve
it

01:42:31.189 --> 01:42:31.199 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:42:34.149 --> 01:42:34.159 align:start position:0%
follow go ahead representative so is
 
01:42:36.109 --> 01:42:36.119 align:start position:0%
what you're saying that the legislative
 
01:42:37.870 --> 01:42:37.880 align:start position:0%
body should have to approve it every
 
01:42:40.790 --> 01:42:40.800 align:start position:0%
year not every year um it probably would
 
01:42:42.950 --> 01:42:42.960 align:start position:0%
be done in the same way that it would be
 
01:42:44.550 --> 01:42:44.560 align:start position:0%
done in the same probably in a very
 
01:42:47.270 --> 01:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
similar fashion as to the current um so
 
01:42:48.709 --> 01:42:48.719 align:start position:0%
the legislative body can currently
 
01:42:50.589 --> 01:42:50.599 align:start position:0%
approve a warrant article that requires
 
01:42:51.990 --> 01:42:52.000 align:start position:0%
the governing body to include on the
 
01:42:54.629 --> 01:42:54.639 align:start position:0%
warrant the tax act um currently they
 
01:42:56.109 --> 01:42:56.119 align:start position:0%
can only you know the legislative body
 
01:42:58.709 --> 01:42:58.719 align:start position:0%
can only require the governing body to
 
01:43:00.350 --> 01:43:00.360 align:start position:0%
do it for one year some municipalities
 
01:43:02.350 --> 01:43:02.360 align:start position:0%
do do it for multi years um even though
 
01:43:04.030 --> 01:43:04.040 align:start position:0%
the governing body isn't required by the
 
01:43:05.990 --> 01:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
legislative body to do it this bill
 
01:43:07.669 --> 01:43:07.679 align:start position:0%
would mandate that without going back to
 
01:43:09.149 --> 01:43:09.159 align:start position:0%
the legislative body you'd have to
 
01:43:11.830 --> 01:43:11.840 align:start position:0%
provide five years um without having to
 
01:43:14.070 --> 01:43:14.080 align:start position:0%
go back to the legislative body and see
 
01:43:15.669 --> 01:43:15.679 align:start position:0%
if that's actually something that the
 
01:43:20.310 --> 01:43:20.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:23.669 --> 01:43:23.679 align:start position:0%
do representative majority thank you Mr
 
01:43:24.990 --> 01:43:25.000 align:start position:0%
Vice chair and thank you for taking my
 
01:43:28.350 --> 01:43:28.360 align:start position:0%
question so if this bill were enabling
 
01:43:31.790 --> 01:43:31.800 align:start position:0%
nhma might support but it doesn't change
 
01:43:35.350 --> 01:43:35.360 align:start position:0%
the the concerns that you can't estimate
 
01:43:39.310 --> 01:43:39.320 align:start position:0%
year 2 three four and five um accurately
 
01:43:41.709 --> 01:43:41.719 align:start position:0%
is is that correct I would say that's
 
01:43:44.270 --> 01:43:44.280 align:start position:0%
correct um you know there there wouldn't
 
01:43:46.430 --> 01:43:46.440 align:start position:0%
be those tax rates especially as you get
 
01:43:48.310 --> 01:43:48.320 align:start position:0%
farther away from from the first year
 
01:43:51.070 --> 01:43:51.080 align:start position:0%
tax rate impact would you know depending
 
01:43:52.629 --> 01:43:52.639 align:start position:0%
on the case and depending on what the
 
01:43:53.990 --> 01:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
type of War article special warrant
 
01:43:56.550 --> 01:43:56.560 align:start position:0%
article is would become possibly less
 
01:43:58.910 --> 01:43:58.920 align:start position:0%
accurate um but again if it was enabling
 
01:44:00.470 --> 01:44:00.480 align:start position:0%
legislation the legislative body wanted
 
01:44:02.589 --> 01:44:02.599 align:start position:0%
to require this of governing bodies um
 
01:44:06.550 --> 01:44:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:09.669 --> 01:44:09.679 align:start position:0%
bill representative
 
01:44:11.870 --> 01:44:11.880 align:start position:0%
gr thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
01:44:14.790 --> 01:44:14.800 align:start position:0%
taking my question would the nhma have
 
01:44:17.669 --> 01:44:17.679 align:start position:0%
an opinion if it clarified it was the
 
01:44:21.830 --> 01:44:21.840 align:start position:0%
expense not the tax rate that was listed
 
01:44:24.750 --> 01:44:24.760 align:start position:0%
um as it's currently written because of
 
01:44:26.750 --> 01:44:26.760 align:start position:0%
the Mandate where the legislative body
 
01:44:28.830 --> 01:44:28.840 align:start position:0%
isn't the one you know making the
 
01:44:31.109 --> 01:44:31.119 align:start position:0%
ultimate decision of whether or not it
 
01:44:33.189 --> 01:44:33.199 align:start position:0%
should be a multi-year you know Pro
 
01:44:35.790 --> 01:44:35.800 align:start position:0%
expense provided on the warrant article
 
01:44:37.589 --> 01:44:37.599 align:start position:0%
um we would we would stay opposed
 
01:44:39.070 --> 01:44:39.080 align:start position:0%
ultimately it should be the legislative
 
01:44:41.070 --> 01:44:41.080 align:start position:0%
body that determines whether or not they
 
01:44:43.109 --> 01:44:43.119 align:start position:0%
want to require the governing body to
 
01:44:45.990 --> 01:44:46.000 align:start position:0%
provide um any additional information or
 
01:44:51.189 --> 01:44:51.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:55.390 --> 01:44:55.400 align:start position:0%
information any other questions for Mr
 
01:44:57.629 --> 01:44:57.639 align:start position:0%
Dees seeing none thank you for coming in
 
01:44:58.629 --> 01:44:58.639 align:start position:0%
sir thank
 
01:45:13.790 --> 01:45:13.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:16.669 --> 01:45:16.679 align:start position:0%
please thank you committee members for
 
01:45:18.589 --> 01:45:18.599 align:start position:0%
the record my name is Eric power I'm
 
01:45:20.390 --> 01:45:20.400 align:start position:0%
from Brookline representing myself in
 
01:45:24.950 --> 01:45:24.960 align:start position:0%
favor of this uh of this Bill HB 138
 
01:45:27.470 --> 01:45:27.480 align:start position:0%
local um I think this is a really
 
01:45:29.310 --> 01:45:29.320 align:start position:0%
important bill for
 
01:45:32.070 --> 01:45:32.080 align:start position:0%
transparency um across the
 
01:45:35.510 --> 01:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
state the you know the bill basically
 
01:45:37.669 --> 01:45:37.679 align:start position:0%
lets people know when they're voting on
 
01:45:39.950 --> 01:45:39.960 align:start position:0%
a multi-year expenditure how much it's
 
01:45:41.950 --> 01:45:41.960 align:start position:0%
going to cost them in the second third
 
01:45:44.709 --> 01:45:44.719 align:start position:0%
and Beyond years and having that tax
 
01:45:48.229 --> 01:45:48.239 align:start position:0%
notation to give them an idea um there
 
01:45:52.109 --> 01:45:52.119 align:start position:0%
are some towns in school districts that
 
01:45:55.109 --> 01:45:55.119 align:start position:0%
do this volunt arily um but there are is
 
01:45:57.390 --> 01:45:57.400 align:start position:0%
many that like to hide the information
 
01:45:59.990 --> 01:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
and they resist it until the voters make
 
01:46:01.629 --> 01:46:01.639 align:start position:0%
them do it and that's what this enabling
 
01:46:04.030 --> 01:46:04.040 align:start position:0%
legislation does so that when the voters
 
01:46:05.950 --> 01:46:05.960 align:start position:0%
when the voters pass this and I've
 
01:46:07.669 --> 01:46:07.679 align:start position:0%
written two petition warn articles that
 
01:46:09.790 --> 01:46:09.800 align:start position:0%
were passed on the first try to do this
 
01:46:12.750 --> 01:46:12.760 align:start position:0%
in in a school district and in our town
 
01:46:14.669 --> 01:46:14.679 align:start position:0%
people overwhelmingly says why wouldn't
 
01:46:18.030 --> 01:46:18.040 align:start position:0%
we want to know how much things cost and
 
01:46:19.709 --> 01:46:19.719 align:start position:0%
the subjects come up at the meeting why
 
01:46:20.790 --> 01:46:20.800 align:start position:0%
can't we know how much it's going to
 
01:46:22.430 --> 01:46:22.440 align:start position:0%
cost in the following years and I says
 
01:46:23.910 --> 01:46:23.920 align:start position:0%
well that the legislature is not giving
 
01:46:26.589 --> 01:46:26.599 align:start position:0%
us the ability to request that the only
 
01:46:27.830 --> 01:46:27.840 align:start position:0%
thing that's been allowed is for the
 
01:46:30.350 --> 01:46:30.360 align:start position:0%
first year so this would make that
 
01:46:32.950 --> 01:46:32.960 align:start position:0%
available I would find it very difficult
 
01:46:35.589 --> 01:46:35.599 align:start position:0%
to think that voters would say you know
 
01:46:37.430 --> 01:46:37.440 align:start position:0%
I only want to know the first year and I
 
01:46:39.189 --> 01:46:39.199 align:start position:0%
really don't care about out years I
 
01:46:40.350 --> 01:46:40.360 align:start position:0%
don't think a voter is going to think
 
01:46:41.870 --> 01:46:41.880 align:start position:0%
that I think the voters that Vote for
 
01:46:44.629 --> 01:46:44.639 align:start position:0%
This want as much information as they
 
01:46:48.550 --> 01:46:48.560 align:start position:0%
can on tax impact and I do agree um it's
 
01:46:50.189 --> 01:46:50.199 align:start position:0%
an estimate it's an estimate for the
 
01:46:51.790 --> 01:46:51.800 align:start position:0%
first year and it's an estimate for
 
01:46:53.629 --> 01:46:53.639 align:start position:0%
outgoing years
 
01:46:55.189 --> 01:46:55.199 align:start position:0%
um but you when you're making that
 
01:46:57.189 --> 01:46:57.199 align:start position:0%
estimate you have to make the estimate
 
01:46:59.589 --> 01:46:59.599 align:start position:0%
based on the current circumstances that
 
01:47:01.390 --> 01:47:01.400 align:start position:0%
you have you have to just go with your
 
01:47:04.070 --> 01:47:04.080 align:start position:0%
current property valuation and
 
01:47:07.589 --> 01:47:07.599 align:start position:0%
assessment and the known best estimate
 
01:47:09.350 --> 01:47:09.360 align:start position:0%
you have on bond rates if it's a bond or
 
01:47:11.709 --> 01:47:11.719 align:start position:0%
lease rates if it's a lease and give
 
01:47:14.310 --> 01:47:14.320 align:start position:0%
people an idea and it is an estimate
 
01:47:17.550 --> 01:47:17.560 align:start position:0%
it's really a qualitative um estimate so
 
01:47:19.709 --> 01:47:19.719 align:start position:0%
that people know if something's 5 cents
 
01:47:21.550 --> 01:47:21.560 align:start position:0%
the first year and then it goes up to 31
 
01:47:23.990 --> 01:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
cents per thousand the second year it is
 
01:47:26.189 --> 01:47:26.199 align:start position:0%
a big difference will it be 28 cents
 
01:47:28.870 --> 01:47:28.880 align:start position:0%
will it be 35 cents no one's going to go
 
01:47:30.310 --> 01:47:30.320 align:start position:0%
back and figure that out but they want
 
01:47:32.550 --> 01:47:32.560 align:start position:0%
to know the rough order of magnitude or
 
01:47:33.669 --> 01:47:33.679 align:start position:0%
how much things are going to cost so
 
01:47:34.790 --> 01:47:34.800 align:start position:0%
they can make a
 
01:47:39.589 --> 01:47:39.599 align:start position:0%
decision uh if you have SP2 um official
 
01:47:41.470 --> 01:47:41.480 align:start position:0%
balloting there are a number of Voters
 
01:47:42.790 --> 01:47:42.800 align:start position:0%
that don't go to the deliberative
 
01:47:45.709 --> 01:47:45.719 align:start position:0%
session and so the uh only information
 
01:47:48.229 --> 01:47:48.239 align:start position:0%
they have is what's on the ballot and by
 
01:47:50.669 --> 01:47:50.679 align:start position:0%
including uh the information with the
 
01:47:52.470 --> 01:47:52.480 align:start position:0%
warant article it does go on the ballot
 
01:47:54.990 --> 01:47:55.000 align:start position:0%
and help helps inform those voters uh
 
01:47:57.070 --> 01:47:57.080 align:start position:0%
unfortunately not everybody's engaged as
 
01:47:59.910 --> 01:47:59.920 align:start position:0%
most people are in this room um and but
 
01:48:02.229 --> 01:48:02.239 align:start position:0%
people can use that information to make
 
01:48:06.510 --> 01:48:06.520 align:start position:0%
decisions um I also served uh in 2020 we
 
01:48:08.149 --> 01:48:08.159 align:start position:0%
were considering adopting an official
 
01:48:11.149 --> 01:48:11.159 align:start position:0%
budget committee and we the uh the town
 
01:48:13.270 --> 01:48:13.280 align:start position:0%
voted to have a what they call a bucom
 
01:48:15.430 --> 01:48:15.440 align:start position:0%
study committee five-person committee I
 
01:48:18.669 --> 01:48:18.679 align:start position:0%
was the chair of that and um as a part
 
01:48:20.910 --> 01:48:20.920 align:start position:0%
of that we looked at peer towns and peer
 
01:48:23.189 --> 01:48:23.199 align:start position:0%
school districts to Brook line across
 
01:48:25.510 --> 01:48:25.520 align:start position:0%
the state there was 21 Pier towns and 20
 
01:48:26.990 --> 01:48:27.000 align:start position:0%
school districts and so we looked at a
 
01:48:29.070 --> 01:48:29.080 align:start position:0%
lot of the issues related to a budget
 
01:48:30.430 --> 01:48:30.440 align:start position:0%
committee but a lot of it involved
 
01:48:33.750 --> 01:48:33.760 align:start position:0%
looking at warrants and budgets and such
 
01:48:37.030 --> 01:48:37.040 align:start position:0%
across these towns and and and about
 
01:48:39.629 --> 01:48:39.639 align:start position:0%
half of them um when we were looking at
 
01:48:41.870 --> 01:48:41.880 align:start position:0%
them they didn't have tax impacts so
 
01:48:43.589 --> 01:48:43.599 align:start position:0%
people at least on their warrant they
 
01:48:45.990 --> 01:48:46.000 align:start position:0%
didn't have it so we would have to have
 
01:48:48.629 --> 01:48:48.639 align:start position:0%
gone maybe looking at a budget hearing
 
01:48:50.390 --> 01:48:50.400 align:start position:0%
um to try to find that information but
 
01:48:52.070 --> 01:48:52.080 align:start position:0%
just you know and going through it there
 
01:48:54.030 --> 01:48:54.040 align:start position:0%
was it was it's definitely there are
 
01:48:55.470 --> 01:48:55.480 align:start position:0%
some that are definitely doing but
 
01:48:56.669 --> 01:48:56.679 align:start position:0%
there's almost an equal number that
 
01:48:58.669 --> 01:48:58.679 align:start position:0%
aren't doing it for whatever reason I
 
01:49:00.189 --> 01:49:00.199 align:start position:0%
don't know if they passed this enabling
 
01:49:02.550 --> 01:49:02.560 align:start position:0%
legislation or if it was voluntary but I
 
01:49:04.629 --> 01:49:04.639 align:start position:0%
just saw that as part of the study when
 
01:49:08.350 --> 01:49:08.360 align:start position:0%
I was doing that I think it's important
 
01:49:11.470 --> 01:49:11.480 align:start position:0%
that um this this is this is an
 
01:49:14.149 --> 01:49:14.159 align:start position:0%
important bill to help make people
 
01:49:16.229 --> 01:49:16.239 align:start position:0%
understand what they're what they're
 
01:49:18.510 --> 01:49:18.520 align:start position:0%
signing up for with the best information
 
01:49:20.669 --> 01:49:20.679 align:start position:0%
that you have it's an estimate and I
 
01:49:23.149 --> 01:49:23.159 align:start position:0%
think it's it's uh it it goes to helping
 
01:49:25.830 --> 01:49:25.840 align:start position:0%
taxpayers make an intelligent decision
 
01:49:28.830 --> 01:49:28.840 align:start position:0%
on uh the commitment they're making um
 
01:49:31.310 --> 01:49:31.320 align:start position:0%
especially with bonds you know we had a
 
01:49:33.430 --> 01:49:33.440 align:start position:0%
warant article last year where the tax
 
01:49:36.149 --> 01:49:36.159 align:start position:0%
impact was Zero which raised suspicion
 
01:49:38.109 --> 01:49:38.119 align:start position:0%
well how can we have a impact of zero if
 
01:49:39.629 --> 01:49:39.639 align:start position:0%
you're getting a bond well there's no
 
01:49:41.270 --> 01:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
cost the first year because the payments
 
01:49:43.470 --> 01:49:43.480 align:start position:0%
were all deferred that's kind of
 
01:49:45.270 --> 01:49:45.280 align:start position:0%
suspicious the one that's even more
 
01:49:46.950 --> 01:49:46.960 align:start position:0%
suspicious is the one that's very small
 
01:49:49.669 --> 01:49:49.679 align:start position:0%
because the interest only payments and
 
01:49:51.310 --> 01:49:51.320 align:start position:0%
that makes people think that you're not
 
01:49:53.870 --> 01:49:53.880 align:start position:0%
spending a lot of money um and people
 
01:49:57.430 --> 01:49:57.440 align:start position:0%
don't people don't translate you know
 
01:49:59.390 --> 01:49:59.400 align:start position:0%
very well most people aren't Savvy
 
01:50:01.550 --> 01:50:01.560 align:start position:0%
enough fiscally to know if I vote for
 
01:50:03.350 --> 01:50:03.360 align:start position:0%
something for $300,000 what's it going
 
01:50:07.470 --> 01:50:07.480 align:start position:0%
to do to my tax rate um but people do
 
01:50:08.950 --> 01:50:08.960 align:start position:0%
understand if it's if I pass it's going
 
01:50:11.830 --> 01:50:11.840 align:start position:0%
to cost me 25 cents per thousand on my
 
01:50:13.430 --> 01:50:13.440 align:start position:0%
on my taxes they'll be able to figure
 
01:50:15.470 --> 01:50:15.480 align:start position:0%
out wow I have a $600,000 house this is
 
01:50:18.950 --> 01:50:18.960 align:start position:0%
going to cost me $150 and maybe I vote
 
01:50:20.990 --> 01:50:21.000 align:start position:0%
for it maybe I don't so for those
 
01:50:24.030 --> 01:50:24.040 align:start position:0%
reasons I recommend Passage and OTP on
 
01:50:26.070 --> 01:50:26.080 align:start position:0%
House Bill 138 and I'll be happy to take
 
01:50:26.080 --> 01:50:28.149 align:start position:0%
House Bill 138 and I'll be happy to take
any

01:50:28.149 --> 01:50:28.159 align:start position:0%
any
 
01:50:30.910 --> 01:50:30.920 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Mr power
 
01:50:34.430 --> 01:50:34.440 align:start position:0%
questions represent Davis thank you Mr
 
01:50:36.790 --> 01:50:36.800 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
01:50:40.229 --> 01:50:40.239 align:start position:0%
so you just cited um a specific
 
01:50:43.990 --> 01:50:44.000 align:start position:0%
number 25 C cents per thousand or
 
01:50:46.750 --> 01:50:46.760 align:start position:0%
something like that and yet earlier in
 
01:50:49.149 --> 01:50:49.159 align:start position:0%
your testimony you said you could only
 
01:50:52.149 --> 01:50:52.159 align:start position:0%
estimate so which is it what should
 
01:50:52.159 --> 01:50:53.870 align:start position:0%
estimate so which is it what should
voters

01:50:53.870 --> 01:50:53.880 align:start position:0%
voters
 
01:50:56.229 --> 01:50:56.239 align:start position:0%
believe if there are such low
 
01:50:57.830 --> 01:50:57.840 align:start position:0%
information as you
 
01:51:01.189 --> 01:51:01.199 align:start position:0%
claim how how do public officials arrive
 
01:51:03.030 --> 01:51:03.040 align:start position:0%
at this
 
01:51:05.310 --> 01:51:05.320 align:start position:0%
estimate thank you for the question so
 
01:51:08.390 --> 01:51:08.400 align:start position:0%
the estimate is based on the tax effort
 
01:51:11.750 --> 01:51:11.760 align:start position:0%
that this warn article will create and
 
01:51:13.830 --> 01:51:13.840 align:start position:0%
that gets divided over the valuation in
 
01:51:15.510 --> 01:51:15.520 align:start position:0%
the town and that that's where they come
 
01:51:17.030 --> 01:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
up with the estimate and it's up to the
 
01:51:19.790 --> 01:51:19.800 align:start position:0%
governing body to approve that estimate
 
01:51:21.270 --> 01:51:21.280 align:start position:0%
you know some estimates could be better
 
01:51:23.069 --> 01:51:23.079 align:start position:0%
than others but at least it's something
 
01:51:25.750 --> 01:51:25.760 align:start position:0%
than nothing and so people want to know
 
01:51:27.270 --> 01:51:27.280 align:start position:0%
that and when you have a budget
 
01:51:28.510 --> 01:51:28.520 align:start position:0%
committee they can actually do that
 
01:51:30.270 --> 01:51:30.280 align:start position:0%
number and give it to the uh School
 
01:51:34.069 --> 01:51:34.079 align:start position:0%
Board to the select board and um that's
 
01:51:38.229 --> 01:51:38.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:41.629 --> 01:51:41.639 align:start position:0%
accurate any of the further
 
01:51:43.589 --> 01:51:43.599 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for
 
01:51:43.599 --> 01:51:44.629 align:start position:0%

five years and I learned the warrant
 
01:52:16.390 --> 01:52:16.400 align:start position:0%
article process after missing the first
 
01:52:19.030 --> 01:52:19.040 align:start position:0%
one but the second one I tried to learn
 
01:52:23.069 --> 01:52:23.079 align:start position:0%
everything and I've been pretty uh
 
01:52:26.390 --> 01:52:26.400 align:start position:0%

transparency Clarity and helping the
 
01:52:35.069 --> 01:52:35.079 align:start position:0%
person that's walking
 
01:52:41.470 --> 01:52:41.480 align:start position:0%
in on a Tuesday with 13
 
01:52:46.629 --> 01:52:46.639 align:start position:0%
pages to go through with a basic number
 
01:52:50.589 --> 01:52:50.599 align:start position:0%
of for instance 20 cents per th000 or 02
 
01:52:54.310 --> 01:52:54.320 align:start position:0%
um 02 cents per
 
01:52:58.109 --> 01:52:58.119 align:start position:0%
th000 I am in support of this bill I
 
01:53:00.350 --> 01:53:00.360 align:start position:0%
feel that when we walk in and we see
 
01:53:03.350 --> 01:53:03.360 align:start position:0%
these and it's an ongoing process to
 
01:53:06.390 --> 01:53:06.400 align:start position:0%
have the first payment is going to be
 
01:53:09.149 --> 01:53:09.159 align:start position:0%
this much and having at least some sort
 
01:53:11.390 --> 01:53:11.400 align:start position:0%
of an idea of what we're getting into
 
01:53:13.470 --> 01:53:13.480 align:start position:0%
before we get into
 
01:53:16.030 --> 01:53:16.040 align:start position:0%
it it's going to help now last year of
 
01:53:17.790 --> 01:53:17.800 align:start position:0%
course we had the revaluation that
 
01:53:20.669 --> 01:53:20.679 align:start position:0%
affected everything and now we've got a
 
01:53:22.030 --> 01:53:22.040 align:start position:0%
whole bunch of things that are coming up
 
01:53:22.950 --> 01:53:22.960 align:start position:0%
this year
 
01:53:25.189 --> 01:53:25.199 align:start position:0%
but I am in I absolutely in favor of
 
01:53:27.550 --> 01:53:27.560 align:start position:0%
this because I think it provides a level
 
01:53:30.709 --> 01:53:30.719 align:start position:0%
of clarity to the voter that may not be
 
01:53:33.470 --> 01:53:33.480 align:start position:0%
the one that is walking in with a
 
01:53:35.030 --> 01:53:35.040 align:start position:0%
calculator to figure out how much is
 
01:53:38.589 --> 01:53:38.599 align:start position:0%
this going to cost them um when I see
 
01:53:41.790 --> 01:53:41.800 align:start position:0%
the the tax impact statements which
 
01:53:45.229 --> 01:53:45.239 align:start position:0%
you'll hear about in the next bill the
 
01:53:46.990 --> 01:53:47.000 align:start position:0%
when you see that it's going to cost 24
 
01:53:49.910 --> 01:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
cents for your budget next year it
 
01:53:52.910 --> 01:53:52.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't say 24 cents more
 
01:53:55.270 --> 01:53:55.280 align:start position:0%
per thousand it just says 24 cents so
 
01:53:57.790 --> 01:53:57.800 align:start position:0%
that's another issue that I have but I
 
01:54:00.629 --> 01:54:00.639 align:start position:0%
will um I I'm open to any questions that
 
01:54:01.750 --> 01:54:01.760 align:start position:0%
you may have
 
01:54:04.229 --> 01:54:04.239 align:start position:0%
and happy to
 
01:54:08.669 --> 01:54:08.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:11.629 --> 01:54:11.639 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you
 
01:54:15.629 --> 01:54:15.639 align:start position:0%
again okay that's the last uh individual
 
01:54:19.350 --> 01:54:19.360 align:start position:0%
to testify on concerning HB 138 so if we
 
01:54:21.030 --> 01:54:21.040 align:start position:0%
have nothing further I'll close the
 
01:54:32.270 --> 01:54:32.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:35.310 --> 01:54:35.320 align:start position:0%
138 rep report in the blue sheet we had
 
01:54:51.310 --> 01:54:51.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:29.390 --> 01:55:29.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:32.030 --> 01:55:32.040 align:start position:0%
so at this time I will open the public
 
01:55:34.109 --> 01:55:34.119 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill
 
01:55:37.430 --> 01:55:37.440 align:start position:0%
284 requiring tax impact statements on
 
01:55:39.910 --> 01:55:39.920 align:start position:0%
Municipal warrant
 
01:55:42.669 --> 01:55:42.679 align:start position:0%
articles first up we have the prime
 
01:55:45.629 --> 01:55:45.639 align:start position:0%
sponsor representative JD Bernardi who
 
01:55:48.790 --> 01:55:48.800 align:start position:0%
is here to introduce the bill to us
 
01:55:52.830 --> 01:55:52.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:54.750 --> 01:55:54.760 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman and thank you
 
01:55:56.589 --> 01:55:56.599 align:start position:0%
committee again for the record my name

is JD Bernardi uh Rockingham 36 Hampton
 
01:56:03.069 --> 01:56:03.079 align:start position:0%
Falls Kensington Southampton Newton and
 
01:56:07.830 --> 01:56:07.840 align:start position:0%
plastow um I'm here to introduce HB 284
 
01:56:10.149 --> 01:56:10.159 align:start position:0%
which deals with I guess what your
 
01:56:14.790 --> 01:56:14.800 align:start position:0%
favorite subject uh Municipal budgets uh
 
01:56:17.510 --> 01:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
you should have three pieces of paper
 
01:56:20.189 --> 01:56:20.199 align:start position:0%
associated with this one is the original
 
01:56:24.669 --> 01:56:24.679 align:start position:0%
Bill one is an Amendment uh to that bill
 
01:56:27.470 --> 01:56:27.480 align:start position:0%
and one is a revised uh financial
 
01:56:30.470 --> 01:56:30.480 align:start position:0%
statement so let me start with the the
 
01:56:33.990 --> 01:56:34.000 align:start position:0%
the the fiscal note uh the new fiscal
 
01:56:37.310 --> 01:56:37.320 align:start position:0%
note basically says what OS put on the
 
01:56:39.350 --> 01:56:39.360 align:start position:0%
original bill was wrong there is no
 
01:56:43.390 --> 01:56:43.400 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact so that takes care of that
 
01:56:46.350 --> 01:56:46.360 align:start position:0%
money issue
 
01:56:50.510 --> 01:56:50.520 align:start position:0%
um turn to the bill itself uh we're
 
01:56:55.310 --> 01:56:55.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:55.320 --> 01:56:57.550 align:start position:0%
 
RSA

01:56:57.550 --> 01:56:57.560 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
01:57:05.589 --> 01:57:05.599 align:start position:0%
325 uh Roman 5 um B Roman 5A and the the
 
01:57:08.629 --> 01:57:08.639 align:start position:0%
first uh the first part of the bill is
 
01:57:12.189 --> 01:57:12.199 align:start position:0%
basically saying that uh when
 
01:57:14.910 --> 01:57:14.920 align:start position:0%
municipalities uh evaluate whether
 
01:57:18.350 --> 01:57:18.360 align:start position:0%
they're going to uh put this information
 
01:57:20.950 --> 01:57:20.960 align:start position:0%
on the ballot it gives them the option
 
01:57:23.910 --> 01:57:23.920 align:start position:0%
to do that this bill is about
 
01:57:26.589 --> 01:57:26.599 align:start position:0%
transparency there should be no option
 
01:57:29.990 --> 01:57:30.000 align:start position:0%
to put this information on we're asking
 
01:57:34.470 --> 01:57:34.480 align:start position:0%
in this bill to require you to tell your
 
01:57:36.830 --> 01:57:36.840 align:start position:0%

does a couple things that were on the
 
01:58:21.030 --> 01:58:21.040 align:start position:0%
originally filed Bill and and adds uh
 
01:58:23.270 --> 01:58:23.280 align:start position:0%
some additional uh uh
 
01:58:25.870 --> 01:58:25.880 align:start position:0%
information first the cost of each
 
01:58:28.430 --> 01:58:28.440 align:start position:0%
warrant article that is on the ballot
 
01:58:32.990 --> 01:58:33.000 align:start position:0%
must be exp must be expressed so article
 
01:58:36.750 --> 01:58:36.760 align:start position:0%
by article by article you have 13 Pages
 
01:58:40.270 --> 01:58:40.280 align:start position:0%
or you have two pages or you have 17
 
01:58:43.790 --> 01:58:43.800 align:start position:0%
pages each article has to have a
 
01:58:48.550 --> 01:58:48.560 align:start position:0%
estimated cost made available to the
 
01:58:51.390 --> 01:58:51.400 align:start position:0%
voter what's been added in the amendment
 
01:58:54.030 --> 01:58:54.040 align:start position:0%
is the cost of fiveyear Appropriations
 
01:58:58.069 --> 01:58:58.079 align:start position:0%
must also be ex expressed and again
 
01:59:02.310 --> 01:59:02.320 align:start position:0%
these are these are estimates uh this
 
01:59:04.390 --> 01:59:04.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that you have to have it
 
01:59:07.109 --> 01:59:07.119 align:start position:0%
exactly right but you have got to use a
 
01:59:10.149 --> 01:59:10.159 align:start position:0%
good faith effort to express to the
 
01:59:14.430 --> 01:59:14.440 align:start position:0%
voters what you expect those costs to be
 
01:59:17.350 --> 01:59:17.360 align:start position:0%
uh and and uh if you're going through
 
01:59:20.189 --> 01:59:20.199 align:start position:0%
evalu revaluation in your community
 
01:59:22.589 --> 01:59:22.599 align:start position:0%
three years from now okay you know your
 
01:59:25.310 --> 01:59:25.320 align:start position:0%
estimate may be a little off but but
 
01:59:29.229 --> 01:59:29.239 align:start position:0%
you're using your best faith effort to
 
01:59:32.910 --> 01:59:32.920 align:start position:0%
give the voter a real and true estimate
 
01:59:35.750 --> 01:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
of what you expect those costs to be for
 
01:59:40.109 --> 01:59:40.119 align:start position:0%
the next five years if you have a cost
 
01:59:42.870 --> 01:59:42.880 align:start position:0%
item buying a new fir Tru or whatever
 
01:59:46.589 --> 01:59:46.599 align:start position:0%
that you're uh you you're uh financing
 
01:59:48.750 --> 01:59:48.760 align:start position:0%
five years or
 
01:59:53.189 --> 01:59:53.199 align:start position:0%
more and the next uh uh addition in the
 
01:59:54.950 --> 01:59:54.960 align:start position:0%
amendment deals with if you're in
 
01:59:57.870 --> 01:59:57.880 align:start position:0%
multi-district towns you have to then
 
02:00:01.149 --> 02:00:01.159 align:start position:0%
Express what those costs also are going
 
02:00:05.270 --> 02:00:05.280 align:start position:0%
to be your proportion of
 
02:00:07.990 --> 02:00:08.000 align:start position:0%
that the next part of the bill deals
 
02:00:11.910 --> 02:00:11.920 align:start position:0%
with uh the total cost of all the
 
02:00:14.910 --> 02:00:14.920 align:start position:0%
warrant articles that are on the ballot
 
02:00:19.270 --> 02:00:19.280 align:start position:0%
so if you voted yes for all of them what
 
02:00:22.750 --> 02:00:22.760 align:start position:0%
would that net cost of saying saying yes
 
02:00:25.910 --> 02:00:25.920 align:start position:0%
to everything be and that must be
 
02:00:30.470 --> 02:00:30.480 align:start position:0%
expressed as a as an estimated cost and
 
02:00:34.470 --> 02:00:34.480 align:start position:0%
finally again uh if you're in multi- uh
 
02:00:37.709 --> 02:00:37.719 align:start position:0%
District towns those costs must be
 
02:00:40.709 --> 02:00:40.719 align:start position:0%
appropriately uh advised over that
 
02:00:44.589 --> 02:00:44.599 align:start position:0%
fiveyear period so with that I will
 
02:00:49.030 --> 02:00:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:51.229 --> 02:00:51.239 align:start position:0%
committee thank you for that bill
 
02:00:53.350 --> 02:00:53.360 align:start position:0%
introduction questions for the
 
02:00:55.589 --> 02:00:55.599 align:start position:0%
representative representative majori is
 
02:00:57.550 --> 02:00:57.560 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question thank you
 
02:00:58.870 --> 02:00:58.880 align:start position:0%
madam chairwoman and thank you
 
02:01:01.310 --> 02:01:01.320 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question um
 
02:01:02.750 --> 02:01:02.760 align:start position:0%
I'm so I'm going off the amendment in
 
02:01:04.990 --> 02:01:05.000 align:start position:0%
line 14 and it says if this warrant
 
02:01:06.709 --> 02:01:06.719 align:start position:0%
article passes there will be an
 
02:01:09.870 --> 02:01:09.880 align:start position:0%
estimated tax impact and my question is
 
02:01:12.750 --> 02:01:12.760 align:start position:0%
to testimony that we've heard on on
 
02:01:16.589 --> 02:01:16.599 align:start position:0%
related bills if we say there will do
 
02:01:19.709 --> 02:01:19.719 align:start position:0%
you anticipate that the public will
 
02:01:22.310 --> 02:01:22.320 align:start position:0%
expect that that's what the tax rate
 
02:01:25.870 --> 02:01:25.880 align:start position:0%
will be and the second part of that is
 
02:01:27.510 --> 02:01:27.520 align:start position:0%
could you amend this to say the
 
02:01:29.069 --> 02:01:29.079 align:start position:0%
estimated tax
 
02:01:32.350 --> 02:01:32.360 align:start position:0%
impact will be instead does that make
 
02:01:32.360 --> 02:01:33.790 align:start position:0%
impact will be instead does that make
some

02:01:33.790 --> 02:01:33.800 align:start position:0%
some
 
02:01:39.910 --> 02:01:39.920 align:start position:0%
sense I that's a semantical question I I
 
02:01:42.870 --> 02:01:42.880 align:start position:0%
would have no problem if you wanted to
 
02:01:45.109 --> 02:01:45.119 align:start position:0%
as a committee amend that say the
 
02:01:49.870 --> 02:01:49.880 align:start position:0%
estimated cost would be um I I would I
 
02:01:51.390 --> 02:01:51.400 align:start position:0%
if you're going to take the time to make
 
02:01:53.589 --> 02:01:53.599 align:start position:0%
that amend mment then I would also
 
02:01:56.750 --> 02:01:56.760 align:start position:0%
suggest you say the estimated increase
 
02:02:00.229 --> 02:02:00.239 align:start position:0%
in your current tax would
 
02:02:03.669 --> 02:02:03.679 align:start position:0%
be and and make it clear that it is
 
02:02:06.390 --> 02:02:06.400 align:start position:0%
above and beyond what has been sort of
 
02:02:11.189 --> 02:02:11.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:13.790 --> 02:02:13.800 align:start position:0%
year representative majority I'm a
 
02:02:17.270 --> 02:02:17.280 align:start position:0%
little confused so you're saying line 14
 
02:02:20.390 --> 02:02:20.400 align:start position:0%
you wanted that word estimated to be
 
02:02:22.350 --> 02:02:22.360 align:start position:0%
inserted no I
 
02:02:25.069 --> 02:02:25.079 align:start position:0%
uh what I was asking is based on the
 
02:02:28.229 --> 02:02:28.239 align:start position:0%
testimony that we've heard on on in
 
02:02:33.669 --> 02:02:33.679 align:start position:0%
today um the word will that is in there
 
02:02:35.990 --> 02:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
does does the sponsor I was asking if
 
02:02:38.950 --> 02:02:38.960 align:start position:0%
the sponsor felt that the public might
 
02:02:42.990 --> 02:02:43.000 align:start position:0%
expect that the word will Intimates that
 
02:02:45.189 --> 02:02:45.199 align:start position:0%
whatever the number is that's what the
 
02:02:48.870 --> 02:02:48.880 align:start position:0%
number will be and they won't assume and
 
02:02:51.870 --> 02:02:51.880 align:start position:0%
they won't further read to estimate will
 
02:02:51.880 --> 02:02:52.910 align:start position:0%
they won't further read to estimate will
will

02:02:52.910 --> 02:02:52.920 align:start position:0%
will
 
02:02:55.669 --> 02:02:55.679 align:start position:0%
estimate I I think if I think it should
 
02:02:58.030 --> 02:02:58.040 align:start position:0%
be omitted omitted I was just asking if
 
02:02:59.950 --> 02:02:59.960 align:start position:0%
he thought it should be omitted thank
 
02:03:02.229 --> 02:03:02.239 align:start position:0%
you for that clarification for me
 
02:03:02.239 --> 02:03:04.950 align:start position:0%
you for that clarification for me
further

02:03:04.950 --> 02:03:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:04.960 --> 02:03:06.510 align:start position:0%
 
questions

02:03:06.510 --> 02:03:06.520 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:03:06.520 --> 02:03:08.350 align:start position:0%
questions
representative

02:03:08.350 --> 02:03:08.360 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:03:10.990 --> 02:03:11.000 align:start position:0%
Guth thank you madam chair and thank you
 
02:03:14.149 --> 02:03:14.159 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I go to go back
 
02:03:16.470 --> 02:03:16.480 align:start position:0%
to the previous question I had on a
 
02:03:16.480 --> 02:03:18.069 align:start position:0%
to the previous question I had on a
previous

02:03:18.069 --> 02:03:18.079 align:start position:0%
previous
 
02:03:21.870 --> 02:03:21.880 align:start position:0%
Bill why why are we holding uh public
 
02:03:26.390 --> 02:03:26.400 align:start position:0%
hearings before the uh the warrant tic
 
02:03:30.030 --> 02:03:30.040 align:start position:0%
or the articles are are acted on and
 
02:03:32.750 --> 02:03:32.760 align:start position:0%
giving out to the town all the
 
02:03:35.390 --> 02:03:35.400 align:start position:0%
information that you are wanting to be
 
02:03:38.870 --> 02:03:38.880 align:start position:0%
put on the on the warrant article isn't
 
02:03:41.430 --> 02:03:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:44.629 --> 02:03:44.639 align:start position:0%
of should is there any reason why we
 
02:03:46.709 --> 02:03:46.719 align:start position:0%
have to put this information on a
 
02:03:49.109 --> 02:03:49.119 align:start position:0%
warrant article where it's available be
 
02:03:52.830 --> 02:03:52.840 align:start position:0%
to the public prior to the uh acting on
 
02:03:56.950 --> 02:03:56.960 align:start position:0%
that Warren article some other
 
02:04:00.310 --> 02:04:00.320 align:start position:0%
place firstly I would say not everyone
 
02:04:03.350 --> 02:04:03.360 align:start position:0%
shows up to your sb2 deliberative
 
02:04:07.470 --> 02:04:07.480 align:start position:0%
sessions um often times people can't
 
02:04:11.030 --> 02:04:11.040 align:start position:0%
spend the time to do that so this
 
02:04:15.549 --> 02:04:15.559 align:start position:0%
information is a very succinct summary
 
02:04:19.109 --> 02:04:19.119 align:start position:0%
it's essentially one sentence that gives
 
02:04:22.750 --> 02:04:22.760 align:start position:0%
people Clarity of what the cost impact
 
02:04:26.430 --> 02:04:26.440 align:start position:0%
of a specific article is this is not a
 
02:04:30.430 --> 02:04:30.440 align:start position:0%
tremendous burden for any town to add to
 
02:04:33.549 --> 02:04:33.559 align:start position:0%
their warrant article this is an issue
 
02:04:33.559 --> 02:04:34.549 align:start position:0%
their warrant article this is an issue
of

02:04:34.549 --> 02:04:34.559 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:04:37.470 --> 02:04:37.480 align:start position:0%
transparency uh I have I am a
 
02:04:40.470 --> 02:04:40.480 align:start position:0%
represented from Five Towns and I
 
02:04:43.030 --> 02:04:43.040 align:start position:0%
participate broadly in the Rockingham
 
02:04:46.270 --> 02:04:46.280 align:start position:0%
County uh various committees this is an
 
02:04:49.950 --> 02:04:49.960 align:start position:0%
issue that has come to me as a
 
02:04:53.310 --> 02:04:53.320 align:start position:0%
transparency problem that many
 
02:04:57.430 --> 02:04:57.440 align:start position:0%
individuals say we need more information
 
02:04:59.229 --> 02:04:59.239 align:start position:0%
and you know I couldn't go to that
 
02:05:02.109 --> 02:05:02.119 align:start position:0%
deliberative session I you know my
 
02:05:05.149 --> 02:05:05.159 align:start position:0%
daughter has uh field hockey that night
 
02:05:08.229 --> 02:05:08.239 align:start position:0%
or whatever it is you know I I couldn't
 
02:05:12.629 --> 02:05:12.639 align:start position:0%
go uh but this information is going to
 
02:05:15.750 --> 02:05:15.760 align:start position:0%
be very helpful to me a very simple
 
02:05:18.629 --> 02:05:18.639 align:start position:0%
short oneline statement on each warrant
 
02:05:21.750 --> 02:05:21.760 align:start position:0%
article one capping article at the end
 
02:05:25.310 --> 02:05:25.320 align:start position:0%
it's very easy it's it it makes a clean
 
02:05:28.109 --> 02:05:28.119 align:start position:0%
statement and IT addresses the concern
 
02:05:29.229 --> 02:05:29.239 align:start position:0%
that you
 
02:05:32.030 --> 02:05:32.040 align:start position:0%
have thank you thank you madam chair
 
02:05:35.310 --> 02:05:35.320 align:start position:0%
further questions representative grund
 
02:05:35.320 --> 02:05:36.030 align:start position:0%
further questions representative grund
is

02:05:36.030 --> 02:05:36.040 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:05:37.910 --> 02:05:37.920 align:start position:0%
recognized thank you madam chair and
 
02:05:40.109 --> 02:05:40.119 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um
 
02:05:42.669 --> 02:05:42.679 align:start position:0%
previous to the previous article my my
 
02:05:46.109 --> 02:05:46.119 align:start position:0%
concern about this and I I'm and I'll
 
02:05:47.149 --> 02:05:47.159 align:start position:0%
get to my
 
02:05:50.549 --> 02:05:50.559 align:start position:0%
question it's a it's an estimate right
 
02:05:53.350 --> 02:05:53.360 align:start position:0%
when we when we estimate tax rate has to
 
02:05:56.950 --> 02:05:56.960 align:start position:0%
estimate right so the prior War article
 
02:05:58.629 --> 02:05:58.639 align:start position:0%
I had mentioned of potentially wanting
 
02:06:00.270 --> 02:06:00.280 align:start position:0%
to amend it to talk about the cost
 
02:06:02.149 --> 02:06:02.159 align:start position:0%
because the cost is a fact-based piece
 
02:06:03.430 --> 02:06:03.440 align:start position:0%
that we can put in
 
02:06:03.440 --> 02:06:05.589 align:start position:0%
that we can put in
there

02:06:05.589 --> 02:06:05.599 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:06:09.229 --> 02:06:09.239 align:start position:0%
um what is your thoughts on that piece
 
02:06:11.589 --> 02:06:11.599 align:start position:0%
of putting the estimated cost for five
 
02:06:13.669 --> 02:06:13.679 align:start position:0%
when you go five years out you have
 
02:06:15.629 --> 02:06:15.639 align:start position:0%
estimated revenues estimated unassigned
 
02:06:17.310 --> 02:06:17.320 align:start position:0%
fund balance some special Waring
 
02:06:19.549 --> 02:06:19.559 align:start position:0%
articles use money raised from new taxes
 
02:06:21.390 --> 02:06:21.400 align:start position:0%
one year they might raise taxes the next
 
02:06:21.400 --> 02:06:22.149 align:start position:0%
one year they might raise taxes the next
year

02:06:22.149 --> 02:06:22.159 align:start position:0%
year
 
02:06:25.470 --> 02:06:25.480 align:start position:0%
it can when you go to estimate a tax
 
02:06:27.750 --> 02:06:27.760 align:start position:0%
rate there's a lot of variables in there
 
02:06:30.350 --> 02:06:30.360 align:start position:0%
so I'm curious as what your thoughts are
 
02:06:32.669 --> 02:06:32.679 align:start position:0%
on all of
 
02:06:34.669 --> 02:06:34.679 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
02:06:40.189 --> 02:06:40.199 align:start position:0%
so cost is also a a you know a potential
 
02:06:43.950 --> 02:06:43.960 align:start position:0%
uh operative Clause however I would say
 
02:06:46.390 --> 02:06:46.400 align:start position:0%
that it's it you're suffering from
 
02:06:48.549 --> 02:06:48.559 align:start position:0%
potentially some of the same problems
 
02:06:50.990 --> 02:06:51.000 align:start position:0%
when when you have when you're if you're
 
02:06:53.870 --> 02:06:53.880 align:start position:0%
estimating a cost uh the you know
 
02:06:56.030 --> 02:06:56.040 align:start position:0%
warrant articles are being put together
 
02:06:59.950 --> 02:06:59.960 align:start position:0%
in uh November through January to get
 
02:07:02.430 --> 02:07:02.440 align:start position:0%
ready ready for deliberative session
 
02:07:07.910 --> 02:07:07.920 align:start position:0%
sessions in uh in in in February um uh
 
02:07:09.870 --> 02:07:09.880 align:start position:0%
you may not have all the bids you may
 
02:07:12.510 --> 02:07:12.520 align:start position:0%
not have the the understanding of what
 
02:07:14.790 --> 02:07:14.800 align:start position:0%
grants are going to be available you may
 
02:07:17.470 --> 02:07:17.480 align:start position:0%
not have all the information so your net
 
02:07:21.830 --> 02:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
cost is also subject to an estimate if
 
02:07:26.069 --> 02:07:26.079 align:start position:0%
you will so um it's six of one half
 
02:07:30.750 --> 02:07:30.760 align:start position:0%
dozen to the other this this uh proposal
 
02:07:30.760 --> 02:07:32.470 align:start position:0%
dozen to the other this this uh proposal
basically

02:07:32.470 --> 02:07:32.480 align:start position:0%
basically
 
02:07:36.830 --> 02:07:36.840 align:start position:0%
targets uh taking that cost which is an
 
02:07:39.790 --> 02:07:39.800 align:start position:0%
estimate and and and uh converting it
 
02:07:42.750 --> 02:07:42.760 align:start position:0%
into what it means for you as a as a
 
02:07:48.030 --> 02:07:48.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:50.310 --> 02:07:50.320 align:start position:0%
articles representative stavis did you
 
02:07:52.709 --> 02:07:52.719 align:start position:0%
have a question
 
02:07:54.510 --> 02:07:54.520 align:start position:0%
I did if you'll bear with me
 
02:07:56.870 --> 02:07:56.880 align:start position:0%
representative it will be an ill-formed
 
02:07:59.510 --> 02:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
question do you want um representative
 
02:08:02.270 --> 02:08:02.280 align:start position:0%
frock to go first while you no okay no
 
02:08:05.149 --> 02:08:05.159 align:start position:0%
um and I realized that the fiscal note
 
02:08:05.159 --> 02:08:06.069 align:start position:0%
um and I realized that the fiscal note
was

02:08:06.069 --> 02:08:06.079 align:start position:0%
was
 
02:08:08.669 --> 02:08:08.679 align:start position:0%
updated and that the fiscal note that we
 
02:08:11.669 --> 02:08:11.679 align:start position:0%
received uh first is no longer valid but
 
02:08:13.030 --> 02:08:13.040 align:start position:0%
I'm just
 
02:08:15.790 --> 02:08:15.800 align:start position:0%
curious about the methodology in the
 
02:08:20.310 --> 02:08:20.320 align:start position:0%
original fiscal note uh are there any
 
02:08:24.830 --> 02:08:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:27.830 --> 02:08:27.840 align:start position:0%
not following the precepts of this bill
 
02:08:31.149 --> 02:08:31.159 align:start position:0%
would result in criminal charges I mean
 
02:08:33.069 --> 02:08:33.079 align:start position:0%
I I don't understand why that was in the
 
02:08:36.470 --> 02:08:36.480 align:start position:0%
original fiscal note well neither did I
 
02:08:39.510 --> 02:08:39.520 align:start position:0%
which is why I asked Can you look at
 
02:08:48.470 --> 02:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:50.990 --> 02:08:51.000 align:start position:0%
revised further questions representative
 
02:08:54.109 --> 02:08:54.119 align:start position:0%
fraus is recognized for a
 
02:08:57.229 --> 02:08:57.239 align:start position:0%
question thank you madam chair thank you
 
02:08:59.750 --> 02:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
representative um hopefully this will be
 
02:09:03.510 --> 02:09:03.520 align:start position:0%
a simple question going back to the
 
02:09:06.790 --> 02:09:06.800 align:start position:0%
original Bill line
 
02:09:11.910 --> 02:09:11.920 align:start position:0%
three says um shall vote to
 
02:09:15.589 --> 02:09:15.599 align:start position:0%
require is the intent of this
 
02:09:18.790 --> 02:09:18.800 align:start position:0%
legislation to hold a vote which could
 
02:09:22.549 --> 02:09:22.559 align:start position:0%
be voted up or down or is the intent to
 
02:09:25.470 --> 02:09:25.480 align:start position:0%
require that the information be
 
02:09:29.390 --> 02:09:29.400 align:start position:0%
published the uh the the entire purpose
 
02:09:31.589 --> 02:09:31.599 align:start position:0%
of the bill is to ensure that the
 
02:09:34.830 --> 02:09:34.840 align:start position:0%
information is published uh and when
 
02:09:36.629 --> 02:09:36.639 align:start position:0%
when these various committees that are
 
02:09:38.709 --> 02:09:38.719 align:start position:0%
coming up with their budget uh
 
02:09:43.069 --> 02:09:43.079 align:start position:0%
information hold their votes uh I the
 
02:09:45.270 --> 02:09:45.280 align:start position:0%
objective here is to say all right the
 
02:09:48.229 --> 02:09:48.239 align:start position:0%
budget committee voted two to one in
 
02:09:51.069 --> 02:09:51.079 align:start position:0%
favor of this so you know whether this
 
02:09:55.430 --> 02:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
was a unanimous or uh or a majority or
 
02:09:58.750 --> 02:09:58.760 align:start position:0%
whatever so you know how the various
 
02:10:01.270 --> 02:10:01.280 align:start position:0%
committees making these assessments came
 
02:10:03.629 --> 02:10:03.639 align:start position:0%
out and what that was what those votes
 
02:10:06.990 --> 02:10:07.000 align:start position:0%
were and it is then
 
02:10:12.430 --> 02:10:12.440 align:start position:0%
published followup yes um all right I
 
02:10:14.709 --> 02:10:14.719 align:start position:0%
just need to to say one thing is that we
 
02:10:16.430 --> 02:10:16.440 align:start position:0%
do have an amendment in front of us and
 
02:10:19.189 --> 02:10:19.199 align:start position:0%
so the amendment um supersedes the bill
 
02:10:21.470 --> 02:10:21.480 align:start position:0%
as filed so we should really be looking
 
02:10:24.790 --> 02:10:24.800 align:start position:0%
at the amendment language and not refer
 
02:10:29.790 --> 02:10:29.800 align:start position:0%
well I is the all right let me go ahead
 
02:10:31.589 --> 02:10:31.599 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I'm I'm thinking as I'm I'm
 
02:10:33.870 --> 02:10:33.880 align:start position:0%
saying what I'm saying so I guess we
 
02:10:35.629 --> 02:10:35.639 align:start position:0%
have two things to consider because the
 
02:10:38.270 --> 02:10:38.280 align:start position:0%
amendment may not be accepted so we do
 
02:10:42.069 --> 02:10:42.079 align:start position:0%
need to look at both parts I I apologize
 
02:10:44.589 --> 02:10:44.599 align:start position:0%
um yes you may may ask a follow-up
 
02:10:48.470 --> 02:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:51.470 --> 02:10:51.480 align:start position:0%
question representative majority thank
 
02:10:53.069 --> 02:10:53.079 align:start position:0%
you madam chairwoman and thank you for
 
02:10:55.390 --> 02:10:55.400 align:start position:0%
taking another question in the in the
 
02:11:00.189 --> 02:11:00.199 align:start position:0%
amended language on lines 18- 20 well
 
02:11:01.750 --> 02:11:01.760 align:start position:0%
I'll speak bluntly but I don't mean to
 
02:11:03.189 --> 02:11:03.199 align:start position:0%
be flip about
 
02:11:06.189 --> 02:11:06.199 align:start position:0%
this why does Northampton care what the
 
02:11:10.229 --> 02:11:10.239 align:start position:0%
impact is going to be to seab Brook and
 
02:11:12.669 --> 02:11:12.679 align:start position:0%
you I'm trying to figure out why is that
 
02:11:15.990 --> 02:11:16.000 align:start position:0%
important to have all of the towns
 
02:11:18.589 --> 02:11:18.599 align:start position:0%
listed there and how can that
 
02:11:23.149 --> 02:11:23.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:26.510 --> 02:11:26.520 align:start position:0%
so Northampton SE okay so we're talking
 
02:11:31.870 --> 02:11:31.880 align:start position:0%
about the SAU uh for wonet uh and in
 
02:11:35.549 --> 02:11:35.559 align:start position:0%
your example okay that that would be the
 
02:11:39.990 --> 02:11:40.000 align:start position:0%
example uh so uh Northampton looking at
 
02:11:43.390 --> 02:11:43.400 align:start position:0%
all right what are we paying for winet
 
02:11:46.910 --> 02:11:46.920 align:start position:0%
school uh versus Hampton versus Hampton
 
02:11:49.549 --> 02:11:49.559 align:start position:0%
Falls versus seab Brook versus what is
 
02:11:53.990 --> 02:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:00.350 --> 02:12:00.360 align:start position:0%
um voters may be concerned that their uh
 
02:12:05.270 --> 02:12:05.280 align:start position:0%
particular interests are are not in in
 
02:12:08.430 --> 02:12:08.440 align:start position:0%
harmony or they're being uh potentially
 
02:12:08.440 --> 02:12:09.589 align:start position:0%
harmony or they're being uh potentially
hurt

02:12:09.589 --> 02:12:09.599 align:start position:0%
hurt
 
02:12:13.669 --> 02:12:13.679 align:start position:0%
or at a differential rate than what's
 
02:12:16.109 --> 02:12:16.119 align:start position:0%
happening in the other community so it's
 
02:12:18.910 --> 02:12:18.920 align:start position:0%
it's just good information to have to
 
02:12:21.669 --> 02:12:21.679 align:start position:0%
see what you know how you are be being
 
02:12:24.229 --> 02:12:24.239 align:start position:0%
treated with respect to everyone else
 
02:12:27.470 --> 02:12:27.480 align:start position:0%
who is participating in paying for that
 
02:12:31.350 --> 02:12:31.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:35.189 --> 02:12:35.199 align:start position:0%
resource I might add that in in multi-
 
02:12:37.350 --> 02:12:37.360 align:start position:0%
toown uh school
 
02:12:40.669 --> 02:12:40.679 align:start position:0%
districts for example you know co-ops
 
02:12:42.629 --> 02:12:42.639 align:start position:0%
the apportionment is different so when
 
02:12:44.470 --> 02:12:44.480 align:start position:0%
the voters are voting on that warrant
 
02:12:46.830 --> 02:12:46.840 align:start position:0%
article they need to have that
 
02:12:55.629 --> 02:12:55.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:57.549 --> 02:12:57.559 align:start position:0%
I'm just providing some clarifying
 
02:12:57.559 --> 02:12:59.669 align:start position:0%
I'm just providing some clarifying
information

02:12:59.669 --> 02:12:59.679 align:start position:0%
information
 
02:13:02.270 --> 02:13:02.280 align:start position:0%
um representative grund is recognized
 
02:13:03.470 --> 02:13:03.480 align:start position:0%
for a
 
02:13:05.990 --> 02:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
question actually it's not a question
 
02:13:10.030 --> 02:13:10.040 align:start position:0%
sorry it's I'll clarify with about
 
02:13:13.189 --> 02:13:13.199 align:start position:0%
multi-district how it's done you you
 
02:13:14.910 --> 02:13:14.920 align:start position:0%
sure you don't want to ask a
 
02:13:17.709 --> 02:13:17.719 align:start position:0%
question I know it's more based on what
 
02:13:19.069 --> 02:13:19.079 align:start position:0%
you guys were talking about than a
 
02:13:24.629 --> 02:13:24.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:24.639 --> 02:13:28.069 align:start position:0%
 
further

02:13:28.069 --> 02:13:28.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:30.669 --> 02:13:30.679 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none did you did I see
 
02:13:32.709 --> 02:13:32.719 align:start position:0%
your hand go up out of the corner mine
 
02:13:36.669 --> 02:13:36.679 align:start position:0%
no further questions seeing none thank
 
02:13:39.950 --> 02:13:39.960 align:start position:0%
you thank you committee I urge you to
 
02:13:42.870 --> 02:13:42.880 align:start position:0%
vote for this resolution for
 
02:13:53.270 --> 02:13:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:02.390 --> 02:14:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:05.629 --> 02:14:05.639 align:start position:0%
trelli welcome to Municipal and County
 
02:14:08.149 --> 02:14:08.159 align:start position:0%
government thank you again uh my name is
 
02:14:10.870 --> 02:14:10.880 align:start position:0%
Joe trelli from Hampton New Hampshire
 
02:14:15.310 --> 02:14:15.320 align:start position:0%
and I would like to uh amplify what
 
02:14:17.030 --> 02:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi was
 
02:14:21.109 --> 02:14:21.119 align:start position:0%
saying about transparency and being able
 
02:14:24.470 --> 02:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
to provide enough information for the
 
02:14:26.350 --> 02:14:26.360 align:start position:0%
voters walking into for instance a
 
02:14:28.950 --> 02:14:28.960 align:start position:0%
13-page ballot with a short amount of
 
02:14:32.030 --> 02:14:32.040 align:start position:0%
time available to vote
 
02:14:34.990 --> 02:14:35.000 align:start position:0%
um one of the things that I I have to
 
02:14:39.709 --> 02:14:39.719 align:start position:0%
say is in my quest for this transparency
 
02:14:43.430 --> 02:14:43.440 align:start position:0%
and getting warrant articles passed last
 
02:14:47.109 --> 02:14:47.119 align:start position:0%
year for instance two to one
 
02:14:51.270 --> 02:14:51.280 align:start position:0%
margin I had this in here shall the town
 
02:14:52.910 --> 02:14:52.920 align:start position:0%
of Hampton provide taxpayers a more
 
02:14:55.069 --> 02:14:55.079 align:start position:0%
relevant cost estimate for proposed
 
02:14:57.750 --> 02:14:57.760 align:start position:0%
spending warrant articles this fiscal
 
02:14:59.870 --> 02:14:59.880 align:start position:0%
impact modification simplifies awareness
 
02:15:01.669 --> 02:15:01.679 align:start position:0%
of the expected cost for the taxpayer
 
02:15:03.109 --> 02:15:03.119 align:start position:0%
associated with each spending article
 
02:15:05.310 --> 02:15:05.320 align:start position:0%
and provides the calculation for not
 
02:15:07.990 --> 02:15:08.000 align:start position:0%
only cost per thousand property
 
02:15:10.990 --> 02:15:11.000 align:start position:0%
valuation but also
 
02:15:13.950 --> 02:15:13.960 align:start position:0%
$400,000 valuation so this is not what
 
02:15:17.830 --> 02:15:17.840 align:start position:0%
this bill is about but we passed that
 
02:15:19.430 --> 02:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
two to one
 
02:15:21.549 --> 02:15:21.559 align:start position:0%
margin because
 
02:15:23.990 --> 02:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
we calculated with friends and neighbors
 
02:15:25.750 --> 02:15:25.760 align:start position:0%
that 400's a great number because it's
 
02:15:28.430 --> 02:15:28.440 align:start position:0%
easy to go to 600 it's easy to go to 800
 
02:15:31.270 --> 02:15:31.280 align:start position:0%
it's easy to go to 200 for your
 
02:15:34.629 --> 02:15:34.639 align:start position:0%
different house so in the draft this
 
02:15:35.830 --> 02:15:35.840 align:start position:0%
year I went to the budget committee
 
02:15:37.589 --> 02:15:37.599 align:start position:0%
meeting and in the draft of all the
 
02:15:37.599 --> 02:15:39.069 align:start position:0%
meeting and in the draft of all the
warant

02:15:39.069 --> 02:15:39.079 align:start position:0%
warant
 
02:15:42.030 --> 02:15:42.040 align:start position:0%
Articles the select board chose to
 
02:15:45.069 --> 02:15:45.079 align:start position:0%
ignore the vote of the people and they
 
02:15:47.910 --> 02:15:47.920 align:start position:0%
simplified it and it says the estimated
 
02:15:52.549 --> 02:15:52.559 align:start position:0%
tax impact in 2025 is two
 
02:15:54.790 --> 02:15:54.800 align:start position:0%
cents where's the rest of the sentence
 
02:15:56.950 --> 02:15:56.960 align:start position:0%
two cents per what well you're supposed
 
02:15:58.629 --> 02:15:58.639 align:start position:0%
to know that that's per
 
02:16:00.950 --> 02:16:00.960 align:start position:0%
thousand excuse
 
02:16:03.629 --> 02:16:03.639 align:start position:0%
me oh well we created a calculator for
 
02:16:05.189 --> 02:16:05.199 align:start position:0%
you and we put it online so that you
 
02:16:07.350 --> 02:16:07.360 align:start position:0%
could put it in and you can add your you
 
02:16:09.830 --> 02:16:09.840 align:start position:0%
can put in your new revaluation into
 
02:16:14.350 --> 02:16:14.360 align:start position:0%
that well that's not good so I mentioned
 
02:16:18.270 --> 02:16:18.280 align:start position:0%
that at the public comment I reminded
 
02:16:20.229 --> 02:16:20.239 align:start position:0%
the budget committee and all the select
 
02:16:21.750 --> 02:16:21.760 align:start position:0%
board that were in in the
 
02:16:26.310 --> 02:16:26.320 align:start position:0%
audience what was voted on last year and
 
02:16:28.549 --> 02:16:28.559 align:start position:0%
passed and it was still ignored and we
 
02:16:31.429 --> 02:16:31.439 align:start position:0%
walked into deliberative it was still
 
02:16:34.349 --> 02:16:34.359 align:start position:0%
ignored so in advance of that I printed
 
02:16:36.790 --> 02:16:36.800 align:start position:0%
up amendments to each of the spending
 
02:16:40.349 --> 02:16:40.359 align:start position:0%
articles printed ready to go signed with
 
02:16:43.870 --> 02:16:43.880 align:start position:0%
what the words should be we spent an
 
02:16:46.750 --> 02:16:46.760 align:start position:0%
hour maybe an hour and a half on the
 
02:16:50.230 --> 02:16:50.240 align:start position:0%
very first one for them to adopt what it
 
02:16:53.030 --> 02:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
was that I suggest suggested the $11,000
 
02:16:55.509 --> 02:16:55.519 align:start position:0%
is a great starting point I think a four
 
02:16:58.309 --> 02:16:58.319 align:start position:0%
I think a $400,000 would be excellent
 
02:17:00.750 --> 02:17:00.760 align:start position:0%
but I also would like to change the word
 
02:17:05.389 --> 02:17:05.399 align:start position:0%
impact tax impact why isn't it tax
 
02:17:08.309 --> 02:17:08.319 align:start position:0%
increase it should say tax increase and
 
02:17:09.950 --> 02:17:09.960 align:start position:0%
I don't know if we can do amendments
 
02:17:12.870 --> 02:17:12.880 align:start position:0%
with this body I'm I'm not sure but I
 
02:17:17.110 --> 02:17:17.120 align:start position:0%
proposed reducing the proposed budget by
 
02:17:17.120 --> 02:17:18.429 align:start position:0%
proposed reducing the proposed budget by
$2

02:17:18.429 --> 02:17:18.439 align:start position:0%
$2
 
02:17:21.549 --> 02:17:21.559 align:start position:0%
million in our warant articles it's 24
 
02:17:23.349 --> 02:17:23.359 align:start position:0%
cents it's only the budget's going to
 
02:17:27.150 --> 02:17:27.160 align:start position:0%
cost 24 cents doesn't say 24 cents more
 
02:17:30.469 --> 02:17:30.479 align:start position:0%
per thousand it just said 24 cents when
 
02:17:34.150 --> 02:17:34.160 align:start position:0%
I presented my number of reducing by 2
 
02:17:37.030 --> 02:17:37.040 align:start position:0%
million it actually showed a negative
 
02:17:39.549 --> 02:17:39.559 align:start position:0%
number for the first time on the
 
02:17:42.070 --> 02:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
projection screen at a w article at a
 
02:17:44.309 --> 02:17:44.319 align:start position:0%
deliberative session it showed this
 
02:17:44.319 --> 02:17:46.190 align:start position:0%
deliberative session it showed this
would

02:17:46.190 --> 02:17:46.200 align:start position:0%
would
 
02:17:50.190 --> 02:17:50.200 align:start position:0%
decrease your tax impact by 8 cents per
 
02:17:50.200 --> 02:17:51.870 align:start position:0%
decrease your tax impact by 8 cents per
thousand

02:17:51.870 --> 02:17:51.880 align:start position:0%
thousand
 
02:17:56.030 --> 02:17:56.040 align:start position:0%
oh my gosh that's $32 for a $400,000
 
02:18:00.669 --> 02:18:00.679 align:start position:0%
house so I vote and I I suggest that you
 
02:18:03.950 --> 02:18:03.960 align:start position:0%
OTP this bill because it really gives
 
02:18:07.030 --> 02:18:07.040 align:start position:0%
the people walking into the booth help
 
02:18:08.549 --> 02:18:08.559 align:start position:0%
and being able to calculate it but can
 
02:18:10.870 --> 02:18:10.880 align:start position:0%
you imagine seeing a negative number and
 
02:18:13.990 --> 02:18:14.000 align:start position:0%
it'll say tax decrease or tax increase I
 
02:18:17.589 --> 02:18:17.599 align:start position:0%
think tax impact is too generic and soft
 
02:18:20.150 --> 02:18:20.160 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions for Mr
 
02:18:20.160 --> 02:18:24.150 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions for Mr
trelli

02:18:24.150 --> 02:18:24.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:26.629 --> 02:18:26.639 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you okay thank
 
02:18:34.709 --> 02:18:34.719 align:start position:0%

02:18:44.070 --> 02:18:44.080 align:start position:0%
name is birie Dees I represent the New
 
02:18:46.469 --> 02:18:46.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Municipal Association and um
 
02:18:48.910 --> 02:18:48.920 align:start position:0%
we are opposed to House Bill 284 as it's
 
02:18:51.230 --> 02:18:51.240 align:start position:0%
currently written um
 
02:18:53.750 --> 02:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
House Bill 284 mandates that the legisl
 
02:18:55.910 --> 02:18:55.920 align:start position:0%
well I have to speak to the bill as
 
02:18:57.669 --> 02:18:57.679 align:start position:0%
introduced to the committee um none of
 
02:18:58.870 --> 02:18:58.880 align:start position:0%
these amendments that have been
 
02:19:01.190 --> 02:19:01.200 align:start position:0%
discussed today are public so apologies
 
02:19:02.070 --> 02:19:02.080 align:start position:0%
if there are amendments that you're
 
02:19:04.790 --> 02:19:04.800 align:start position:0%
currently reviewing and considering um
 
02:19:07.469 --> 02:19:07.479 align:start position:0%
House Bill 284 as it was introduced
 
02:19:09.709 --> 02:19:09.719 align:start position:0%
mandates that the legislative body votes
 
02:19:11.469 --> 02:19:11.479 align:start position:0%
to require governing bodies to add their
 
02:19:13.830 --> 02:19:13.840 align:start position:0%
numerically tallied recommendations with
 
02:19:15.950 --> 02:19:15.960 align:start position:0%
each warant article so this would be a
 
02:19:18.309 --> 02:19:18.319 align:start position:0%
mandate to the legislative body that
 
02:19:23.469 --> 02:19:23.479 align:start position:0%
they shall vote to do this um it's an
 
02:19:26.230 --> 02:19:26.240 align:start position:0%
unorthodox way of of mandating a uh
 
02:19:28.669 --> 02:19:28.679 align:start position:0%
limitation on local control to mandate a
 
02:19:31.110 --> 02:19:31.120 align:start position:0%
vote of the legislative body but um you
 
02:19:32.830 --> 02:19:32.840 align:start position:0%
know that that's a concern of ours where
 
02:19:35.110 --> 02:19:35.120 align:start position:0%
what if the legislative body doesn't
 
02:19:38.629 --> 02:19:38.639 align:start position:0%
vote as um as instructed in the bill um
 
02:19:40.549 --> 02:19:40.559 align:start position:0%
removes a language from RSA that permits
 
02:19:42.270 --> 02:19:42.280 align:start position:0%
the governing body to if it wants
 
02:19:43.709 --> 02:19:43.719 align:start position:0%
provide these tallies even if the
 
02:19:45.349 --> 02:19:45.359 align:start position:0%
legislative body doesn't require these
 
02:19:47.389 --> 02:19:47.399 align:start position:0%
numerically tallied recommendations to
 
02:19:49.309 --> 02:19:49.319 align:start position:0%
accompany each warrant article which
 
02:19:50.910 --> 02:19:50.920 align:start position:0%
then gets into the ambiguities of what
 
02:19:52.550 --> 02:19:52.560 align:start position:0%
happens if the legislative body decides
 
02:19:54.510 --> 02:19:54.520 align:start position:0%
that it's not going to vote um in
 
02:19:56.870 --> 02:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
accordance with the state mandate um it
 
02:19:58.990 --> 02:19:59.000 align:start position:0%
also mandates how the tax impact is
 
02:20:00.750 --> 02:20:00.760 align:start position:0%
written utilizing the tax impact as a
 
02:20:02.830 --> 02:20:02.840 align:start position:0%
dollar amount per thousand of assessed
 
02:20:05.230 --> 02:20:05.240 align:start position:0%
property value um which is pretty
 
02:20:07.070 --> 02:20:07.080 align:start position:0%
standard in most municipalities and
 
02:20:09.429 --> 02:20:09.439 align:start position:0%
that's typically how they do it um the
 
02:20:11.830 --> 02:20:11.840 align:start position:0%
mandated tax impact language is somewhat
 
02:20:13.550 --> 02:20:13.560 align:start position:0%
confusing though because for example
 
02:20:16.950 --> 02:20:16.960 align:start position:0%
what goes in the blank on um line 18 if
 
02:20:20.830 --> 02:20:20.840 align:start position:0%
the following blank passes um I mean
 
02:20:22.110 --> 02:20:22.120 align:start position:0%
assumption is it should say if the
 
02:20:25.150 --> 02:20:25.160 align:start position:0%
following warrant article passes um you
 
02:20:27.990 --> 02:20:28.000 align:start position:0%
know and we're unsure why you wouldn't
 
02:20:29.590 --> 02:20:29.600 align:start position:0%
indicate that why you would give the
 
02:20:31.750 --> 02:20:31.760 align:start position:0%
municipalities um you know what I mean
 
02:20:32.750 --> 02:20:32.760 align:start position:0%
municipalities would probably be
 
02:20:33.750 --> 02:20:33.760 align:start position:0%
confused what are we supposed to put
 
02:20:35.590 --> 02:20:35.600 align:start position:0%
there other than Warren articles um I
 
02:20:36.990 --> 02:20:37.000 align:start position:0%
think logically it proceeds you should
 
02:20:38.670 --> 02:20:38.680 align:start position:0%
put waren articles but if there's some
 
02:20:40.550 --> 02:20:40.560 align:start position:0%
kind of intent that some other language
 
02:20:42.550 --> 02:20:42.560 align:start position:0%
should go there or options of language
 
02:20:43.830 --> 02:20:43.840 align:start position:0%
um the legislature should be a little
 
02:20:45.349 --> 02:20:45.359 align:start position:0%
bit more
 
02:20:45.359 --> 02:20:47.469 align:start position:0%
bit more
explicit

02:20:47.469 --> 02:20:47.479 align:start position:0%
explicit
 
02:20:50.030 --> 02:20:50.040 align:start position:0%
um it also mandates this bill would
 
02:20:51.870 --> 02:20:51.880 align:start position:0%
mandate a tax impact summary at the end
 
02:20:53.309 --> 02:20:53.319 align:start position:0%
of the warrant article that reflects the
 
02:20:55.510 --> 02:20:55.520 align:start position:0%
tax rate impact should every warrant
 
02:20:58.030 --> 02:20:58.040 align:start position:0%
article pass um it allows the tax impact
 
02:20:59.630 --> 02:20:59.640 align:start position:0%
summary to be approved by the governing
 
02:21:02.070 --> 02:21:02.080 align:start position:0%
body which we you know we generally
 
02:21:03.190 --> 02:21:03.200 align:start position:0%
support that at least having the
 
02:21:05.750 --> 02:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
governing body have some um ability to
 
02:21:07.309 --> 02:21:07.319 align:start position:0%
use its discretion to determine these
 
02:21:10.309 --> 02:21:10.319 align:start position:0%
tax impacts with its administrators um
 
02:21:12.510 --> 02:21:12.520 align:start position:0%
the only thing I'll point out is that um
 
02:21:15.270 --> 02:21:15.280 align:start position:0%
you know voters will vote down warrant
 
02:21:17.469 --> 02:21:17.479 align:start position:0%
articles and um so it might not reflect
 
02:21:19.389 --> 02:21:19.399 align:start position:0%
the actual tax rate impact should
 
02:21:21.110 --> 02:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
warrant articles fail I know in some
 
02:21:22.950 --> 02:21:22.960 align:start position:0%
communities worn articles are often well
 
02:21:24.670 --> 02:21:24.680 align:start position:0%
supported the ones that are presented by
 
02:21:26.710 --> 02:21:26.720 align:start position:0%
the governing body but in some
 
02:21:28.110 --> 02:21:28.120 align:start position:0%
municipalities that's not always the
 
02:21:30.190 --> 02:21:30.200 align:start position:0%
case Warren articles are regularly um
 
02:21:32.309 --> 02:21:32.319 align:start position:0%
defeated just because the voters don't
 
02:21:33.950 --> 02:21:33.960 align:start position:0%
want to spend or they feel as if the
 
02:21:36.270 --> 02:21:36.280 align:start position:0%
municipality can wait um to spend on a
 
02:21:39.870 --> 02:21:39.880 align:start position:0%
specific item um nothing prevents
 
02:21:41.510 --> 02:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
municipalities from doing a summary
 
02:21:43.870 --> 02:21:43.880 align:start position:0%
statement um in the town warrant or
 
02:21:46.349 --> 02:21:46.359 align:start position:0%
other public place for example um in the
 
02:21:48.469 --> 02:21:48.479 align:start position:0%
town the municipality where I reside um
 
02:21:50.070 --> 02:21:50.080 align:start position:0%
during the budget presentation not just
 
02:21:52.110 --> 02:21:52.120 align:start position:0%
at the hearings for the budget but also
 
02:21:54.750 --> 02:21:54.760 align:start position:0%
at deliberative um it's shown to us what
 
02:21:57.110 --> 02:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
exactly the operating budget tax rate
 
02:21:58.750 --> 02:21:58.760 align:start position:0%
impact will be and then the total impact
 
02:22:01.110 --> 02:22:01.120 align:start position:0%
of all the warrant articles um and that
 
02:22:02.990 --> 02:22:03.000 align:start position:0%
is often placed on uh communities
 
02:22:05.750 --> 02:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
websites um you know voters often will
 
02:22:07.150 --> 02:22:07.160 align:start position:0%
you know request that these things be
 
02:22:09.270 --> 02:22:09.280 align:start position:0%
done and municipalities are flexible and
 
02:22:11.349 --> 02:22:11.359 align:start position:0%
um support the transparency to let
 
02:22:13.070 --> 02:22:13.080 align:start position:0%
voters know you know this this is how
 
02:22:17.309 --> 02:22:17.319 align:start position:0%
it'll impact your taxes um not all tax
 
02:22:20.349 --> 02:22:20.359 align:start position:0%
impacts create an increase in tax impact
 
02:22:22.190 --> 02:22:22.200 align:start position:0%
um so the notations for example
 
02:22:24.590 --> 02:22:24.600 align:start position:0%
oftentimes governing bodies will want to
 
02:22:27.070 --> 02:22:27.080 align:start position:0%
include the tax rate impact to show that
 
02:22:29.309 --> 02:22:29.319 align:start position:0%
a specific warn article won't have an
 
02:22:32.910 --> 02:22:32.920 align:start position:0%
impact um in in in the uh in the
 
02:22:34.630 --> 02:22:34.640 align:start position:0%
interest of creating Clarity and
 
02:22:36.150 --> 02:22:36.160 align:start position:0%
transparency and ensuring that the
 
02:22:38.550 --> 02:22:38.560 align:start position:0%
voters um understand that maybe the
 
02:22:41.190 --> 02:22:41.200 align:start position:0%
specific warrant article um won't create
 
02:22:44.830 --> 02:22:44.840 align:start position:0%
any additional cost in their tax bills
 
02:22:48.950 --> 02:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
um so those are some of our our concerns
 
02:22:51.070 --> 02:22:51.080 align:start position:0%
and um and some of our point points of
 
02:22:53.110 --> 02:22:53.120 align:start position:0%
hopefully Clarity that that we'd like to
 
02:22:55.389 --> 02:22:55.399 align:start position:0%
raise and provide and um I'll I'll
 
02:22:57.230 --> 02:22:57.240 align:start position:0%
answer any questions should it be
 
02:23:01.270 --> 02:23:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:04.429 --> 02:23:04.439 align:start position:0%
Dees representative majori thank you
 
02:23:06.070 --> 02:23:06.080 align:start position:0%
madam chairwoman and thank you for
 
02:23:07.830 --> 02:23:07.840 align:start position:0%
taking my question would would have been
 
02:23:09.510 --> 02:23:09.520 align:start position:0%
more appropriate to ask the sponsor and
 
02:23:12.070 --> 02:23:12.080 align:start position:0%
I apologize but I'll ask you Mr the Shan
 
02:23:13.389 --> 02:23:13.399 align:start position:0%
maybe you know you don't have the
 
02:23:15.110 --> 02:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
amendment in front of you so I'll read
 
02:23:18.590 --> 02:23:18.600 align:start position:0%
what it says between lines 22 and 25 if
 
02:23:20.910 --> 02:23:20.920 align:start position:0%
the town has adopted use of the B well
 
02:23:24.030 --> 02:23:24.040 align:start position:0%
I'll summarize um the total tax impact
 
02:23:27.030 --> 02:23:27.040 align:start position:0%
summary shall also be included on the
 
02:23:29.670 --> 02:23:29.680 align:start position:0%
official ballot before the first warrant
 
02:23:29.680 --> 02:23:31.110 align:start position:0%
official ballot before the first warrant
article

02:23:31.110 --> 02:23:31.120 align:start position:0%
article
 
02:23:33.190 --> 02:23:33.200 align:start position:0%
question is that
 
02:23:35.710 --> 02:23:35.720 align:start position:0%
legal has do you know if that would pass
 
02:23:35.720 --> 02:23:36.830 align:start position:0%
legal has do you know if that would pass
Dr

02:23:36.830 --> 02:23:36.840 align:start position:0%
Dr
 
02:23:39.630 --> 02:23:39.640 align:start position:0%
scrutiny if I so before the first
 
02:23:41.590 --> 02:23:41.600 align:start position:0%
warrant article question before the
 
02:23:44.269 --> 02:23:44.279 align:start position:0%
first warrant article question um to my
 
02:23:46.910 --> 02:23:46.920 align:start position:0%
total tax excuse me the the my question
 
02:23:49.469 --> 02:23:49.479 align:start position:0%
is what this says is the total tax
 
02:23:52.590 --> 02:23:52.600 align:start position:0%
impact if all one warrant articles pass
 
02:23:54.910 --> 02:23:54.920 align:start position:0%
shall be included as a statement before
 
02:23:56.790 --> 02:23:56.800 align:start position:0%
the first warrant article questioned do
 
02:23:59.230 --> 02:23:59.240 align:start position:0%
you know if that would pass Dr scrutiny
 
02:24:01.309 --> 02:24:01.319 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure You' have to ask Dr what I
 
02:24:03.389 --> 02:24:03.399 align:start position:0%
can share is that there's already
 
02:24:05.230 --> 02:24:05.240 align:start position:0%
requirements in state law that bonded
 
02:24:08.030 --> 02:24:08.040 align:start position:0%
articles and the operating budget are
 
02:24:09.990 --> 02:24:10.000 align:start position:0%
the beginning of the warrant especially
 
02:24:11.870 --> 02:24:11.880 align:start position:0%
uh in in traditional town meeting towns
 
02:24:14.510 --> 02:24:14.520 align:start position:0%
and in sb2 they're the first um money
 
02:24:16.269 --> 02:24:16.279 align:start position:0%
warrant articles and then you have to
 
02:24:19.550 --> 02:24:19.560 align:start position:0%
have the um the zoning ordinance changes
 
02:24:21.790 --> 02:24:21.800 align:start position:0%
presented by the plan board in an sb2
 
02:24:23.830 --> 02:24:23.840 align:start position:0%
town so I guess an sb2 would be a
 
02:24:26.110 --> 02:24:26.120 align:start position:0%
strange place to put it ahead of all of
 
02:24:28.750 --> 02:24:28.760 align:start position:0%
the zoning ordinance changes and in
 
02:24:30.830 --> 02:24:30.840 align:start position:0%
traditional town meeting it would go
 
02:24:33.309 --> 02:24:33.319 align:start position:0%
before the bonded and the operating
 
02:24:35.429 --> 02:24:35.439 align:start position:0%
budget which in state law are required
 
02:24:38.670 --> 02:24:38.680 align:start position:0%
to be you know top of the warrant so I
 
02:24:39.870 --> 02:24:39.880 align:start position:0%
guess it wouldn't be strange I just
 
02:24:42.110 --> 02:24:42.120 align:start position:0%
wouldn't know how that language May
 
02:24:43.990 --> 02:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
conflict with the existing legislative
 
02:24:45.389 --> 02:24:45.399 align:start position:0%
language and I think that'd be a great
 
02:24:47.670 --> 02:24:47.680 align:start position:0%
question for the committee to send a Dr
 
02:24:48.990 --> 02:24:49.000 align:start position:0%
and to ask if they have recommended
 
02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:51.550 align:start position:0%
and to ask if they have recommended
language

02:24:51.550 --> 02:24:51.560 align:start position:0%
language
 
02:24:51.560 --> 02:24:53.269 align:start position:0%

further
 
02:24:57.230 --> 02:24:57.240 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
 
02:25:02.510 --> 02:25:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:04.590 --> 02:25:04.600 align:start position:0%
power good morning and welcome to
 
02:25:08.630 --> 02:25:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:11.309 --> 02:25:11.319 align:start position:0%
government thank you Madame chair
 
02:25:13.550 --> 02:25:13.560 align:start position:0%
committee members for the record uh my
 
02:25:15.630 --> 02:25:15.640 align:start position:0%
name is Eric power from Brookline
 
02:25:17.630 --> 02:25:17.640 align:start position:0%
representing myself and in favor of this
 
02:25:20.750 --> 02:25:20.760 align:start position:0%
bill and the amendment
 
02:25:23.830 --> 02:25:23.840 align:start position:0%
um in section one of the bill it talks
 
02:25:27.429 --> 02:25:27.439 align:start position:0%
about requiring the uh the numeric tally
 
02:25:31.590 --> 02:25:31.600 align:start position:0%
of votes uh in the Warren article and I
 
02:25:34.590 --> 02:25:34.600 align:start position:0%
think that's a great thing um right now
 
02:25:36.590 --> 02:25:36.600 align:start position:0%
it's sort of optional I guess the town
 
02:25:39.510 --> 02:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
can vote to do that but if the town
 
02:25:41.349 --> 02:25:41.359 align:start position:0%
doesn't vote to do that it's really at
 
02:25:43.110 --> 02:25:43.120 align:start position:0%
the will of the governing body and if
 
02:25:45.309 --> 02:25:45.319 align:start position:0%
they're at opposition to their finance
 
02:25:47.030 --> 02:25:47.040 align:start position:0%
committee if it's advisory or a budget
 
02:25:49.349 --> 02:25:49.359 align:start position:0%
committee they may just put their
 
02:25:51.230 --> 02:25:51.240 align:start position:0%
recommendation on there and leave off
 
02:25:53.030 --> 02:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
the budget committee or Finance
 
02:25:54.830 --> 02:25:54.840 align:start position:0%
committee's recommendation that's
 
02:25:56.349 --> 02:25:56.359 align:start position:0%
there's nothing stopping them from doing
 
02:25:58.269 --> 02:25:58.279 align:start position:0%
that so this would prevent that it's
 
02:26:00.830 --> 02:26:00.840 align:start position:0%
full disclosure on have how um how these
 
02:26:02.830 --> 02:26:02.840 align:start position:0%
committees voted so I think that's a
 
02:26:05.590 --> 02:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
really good uh update to the
 
02:26:09.110 --> 02:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
rsas um I'd also mention that you know
 
02:26:12.510 --> 02:26:12.520 align:start position:0%
the long budget process there is public
 
02:26:14.790 --> 02:26:14.800 align:start position:0%
hearings required and then if you have
 
02:26:16.349 --> 02:26:16.359 align:start position:0%
SP2 you have a deliberative session and
 
02:26:17.670 --> 02:26:17.680 align:start position:0%
then a balloting session and a
 
02:26:18.910 --> 02:26:18.920 align:start position:0%
traditional meeting you just have the
 
02:26:21.710 --> 02:26:21.720 align:start position:0%
traditional meeting um the public
 
02:26:24.389 --> 02:26:24.399 align:start position:0%
hearings are good they're hard to get to
 
02:26:26.030 --> 02:26:26.040 align:start position:0%
I've been to some I miss some because
 
02:26:29.750 --> 02:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
I'm traveling um but they don't always
 
02:26:32.070 --> 02:26:32.080 align:start position:0%
talk about tax impact they talk about
 
02:26:34.990 --> 02:26:35.000 align:start position:0%
numbers they talk about costs and they
 
02:26:37.070 --> 02:26:37.080 align:start position:0%
don't always have the tax impact and
 
02:26:38.630 --> 02:26:38.640 align:start position:0%
sometimes you have to get that later
 
02:26:41.309 --> 02:26:41.319 align:start position:0%
when you actually see the ballot so the
 
02:26:43.030 --> 02:26:43.040 align:start position:0%
best practice of showing tax impact
 
02:26:45.349 --> 02:26:45.359 align:start position:0%
doesn't always happen but if you if this
 
02:26:47.070 --> 02:26:47.080 align:start position:0%
bill was to become law you would
 
02:26:48.429 --> 02:26:48.439 align:start position:0%
actually see it when you got to your
 
02:26:50.670 --> 02:26:50.680 align:start position:0%
deliberative session or your traditional
 
02:26:51.790 --> 02:26:51.800 align:start position:0%
meeting because you would see it in the
 
02:26:54.150 --> 02:26:54.160 align:start position:0%
warrant ahead of the meeting um so I
 
02:26:56.349 --> 02:26:56.359 align:start position:0%
think that's also really important and
 
02:26:58.349 --> 02:26:58.359 align:start position:0%
also that you know each of the Articles
 
02:27:00.469 --> 02:27:00.479 align:start position:0%
it's important that it's you see the
 
02:27:04.510 --> 02:27:04.520 align:start position:0%
individual impact because um in a macro
 
02:27:06.389 --> 02:27:06.399 align:start position:0%
view you might not know exactly what
 
02:27:07.750 --> 02:27:07.760 align:start position:0%
your tax rate is but you know
 
02:27:10.309 --> 02:27:10.319 align:start position:0%
individually voting for something
 
02:27:12.389 --> 02:27:12.399 align:start position:0%
generally how much will it cost you to
 
02:27:14.309 --> 02:27:14.319 align:start position:0%
go up or down it is still an estimate
 
02:27:15.389 --> 02:27:15.399 align:start position:0%
because there could be revenues that
 
02:27:16.910 --> 02:27:16.920 align:start position:0%
defay it but at least you have an upper
 
02:27:18.870 --> 02:27:18.880 align:start position:0%
bound on what it would cost when you're
 
02:27:21.070 --> 02:27:21.080 align:start position:0%
voting for it
 
02:27:25.110 --> 02:27:25.120 align:start position:0%
uh I think it's a really good uh bill in
 
02:27:27.230 --> 02:27:27.240 align:start position:0%
the amendment section two which talks
 
02:27:31.710 --> 02:27:31.720 align:start position:0%
about requiring the tax impact to be on
 
02:27:34.670 --> 02:27:34.680 align:start position:0%
uh the warrant and also on the ballot I
 
02:27:36.990 --> 02:27:37.000 align:start position:0%
think that's really important to for
 
02:27:41.469 --> 02:27:41.479 align:start position:0%
voters um they will they will um they
 
02:27:43.630 --> 02:27:43.640 align:start position:0%
will find that information enlightening
 
02:27:46.150 --> 02:27:46.160 align:start position:0%
when they're actually voting um and I
 
02:27:48.590 --> 02:27:48.600 align:start position:0%
also mention on lines 18 to 20 of the
 
02:27:50.710 --> 02:27:50.720 align:start position:0%
Amendments that
 
02:27:53.590 --> 02:27:53.600 align:start position:0%
um in a multi- toown district not
 
02:27:57.630 --> 02:27:57.640 align:start position:0%
everybody uses sb2 and so having it on
 
02:27:59.590 --> 02:27:59.600 align:start position:0%
the warrant is important because that
 
02:28:01.190 --> 02:28:01.200 align:start position:0%
you only have one warrant so if you're
 
02:28:02.790 --> 02:28:02.800 align:start position:0%
at a Cooperative district with a
 
02:28:05.150 --> 02:28:05.160 align:start position:0%
traditional meeting each Town wants to
 
02:28:06.590 --> 02:28:06.600 align:start position:0%
know how much it's going to cost based
 
02:28:08.389 --> 02:28:08.399 align:start position:0%
on the apportionment formula so I think
 
02:28:10.630 --> 02:28:10.640 align:start position:0%
it's important there whether it's on the
 
02:28:13.910 --> 02:28:13.920 align:start position:0%
ballot for in an sb2 multi- toown
 
02:28:16.230 --> 02:28:16.240 align:start position:0%
District I still think it's valuable to
 
02:28:17.870 --> 02:28:17.880 align:start position:0%
see how much is impacting your neighbors
 
02:28:19.950 --> 02:28:19.960 align:start position:0%
who are in the co-op maybe you might not
 
02:28:21.910 --> 02:28:21.920 align:start position:0%
like like how much less they're paying
 
02:28:23.389 --> 02:28:23.399 align:start position:0%
than you maybe you're happy you're
 
02:28:25.469 --> 02:28:25.479 align:start position:0%
paying less than someone else there's
 
02:28:27.070 --> 02:28:27.080 align:start position:0%
nothing wrong with people knowing that
 
02:28:28.830 --> 02:28:28.840 align:start position:0%
information it's not going to take up
 
02:28:32.630 --> 02:28:32.640 align:start position:0%
that much room um but I think you know
 
02:28:36.269 --> 02:28:36.279 align:start position:0%
for people to have the full disclosure
 
02:28:38.670 --> 02:28:38.680 align:start position:0%
and being mandatory I think is a very
 
02:28:42.070 --> 02:28:42.080 align:start position:0%
good thing across the state for voters
 
02:28:43.830 --> 02:28:43.840 align:start position:0%
um because I think it will you know
 
02:28:45.710 --> 02:28:45.720 align:start position:0%
people looking at a town warrant may
 
02:28:47.389 --> 02:28:47.399 align:start position:0%
make a decision to even go to the
 
02:28:50.630 --> 02:28:50.640 align:start position:0%
meeting um based on what they see on the
 
02:28:52.750 --> 02:28:52.760 align:start position:0%
warrant and obviously in an sb2 town
 
02:28:54.750 --> 02:28:54.760 align:start position:0%
when they're voting on the ballot they
 
02:28:56.550 --> 02:28:56.560 align:start position:0%
will have that information right in
 
02:28:59.190 --> 02:28:59.200 align:start position:0%
front of them so I think this is a
 
02:29:02.269 --> 02:29:02.279 align:start position:0%
really good bill I think having the the
 
02:29:05.389 --> 02:29:05.399 align:start position:0%
information in dollars per thousand is a
 
02:29:07.469 --> 02:29:07.479 align:start position:0%
good one because I think that's a common
 
02:29:10.510 --> 02:29:10.520 align:start position:0%
ground there's different ways that when
 
02:29:13.750 --> 02:29:13.760 align:start position:0%
people do pass the tax impact how they
 
02:29:15.670 --> 02:29:15.680 align:start position:0%
express it and prescribing it in this
 
02:29:18.190 --> 02:29:18.200 align:start position:0%
uniform way I think is is a very common
 
02:29:21.630 --> 02:29:21.640 align:start position:0%
good common denominator for for people
 
02:29:24.349 --> 02:29:24.359 align:start position:0%
to understand and for those reasons I
 
02:29:27.469 --> 02:29:27.479 align:start position:0%
hope that you pass uh House Bill 284
 
02:29:29.469 --> 02:29:29.479 align:start position:0%
with Amendment and I'll take any
 
02:29:33.950 --> 02:29:33.960 align:start position:0%
questions thank you questions for Mr
 
02:29:36.990 --> 02:29:37.000 align:start position:0%
power seeing none thank you that was my
 
02:29:39.030 --> 02:29:39.040 align:start position:0%
last pin card so at this time I will ask

02:29:45.429 --> 02:29:45.439 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to do
 
02:29:49.830 --> 02:29:49.840 align:start position:0%
so okay seeing none um we will report

breakdown of tax changes in information
 
02:32:04.190 --> 02:32:04.200 align:start position:0%

02:32:39.870 --> 02:32:39.880 align:start position:0%
Arend good morning and welcome to
 
02:32:55.429 --> 02:32:55.439 align:start position:0%

sit on there we go sorry uh my name is
 
02:33:01.110 --> 02:33:01.120 align:start position:0%
Josh Aaron I work for Avatar Associates
 
02:33:02.910 --> 02:33:02.920 align:start position:0%
uh we represent about or our software is
 
02:33:05.190 --> 02:33:05.200 align:start position:0%
in used by about 160 municipalities
 
02:33:09.190 --> 02:33:09.200 align:start position:0%
throughout the uh State I was asked to
 
02:33:12.070 --> 02:33:12.080 align:start position:0%
be here by the uh representative from
 
02:33:14.750 --> 02:33:14.760 align:start position:0%
The Tax Collectors Association just to
 
02:33:17.830 --> 02:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
um I don't speak personally in favor or
 
02:33:19.950 --> 02:33:19.960 align:start position:0%
against the bill as just seeking some
 
02:33:23.389 --> 02:33:23.399 align:start position:0%
more clarification I guess um on some of
 
02:33:26.349 --> 02:33:26.359 align:start position:0%
the language in the bill um particularly
 
02:33:28.469 --> 02:33:28.479 align:start position:0%
I think that the concern was
 
02:33:32.750 --> 02:33:32.760 align:start position:0%
the um this the statement in the bill
 
02:33:35.910 --> 02:33:35.920 align:start position:0%
that uh the financial impact would be um
 
02:33:39.150 --> 02:33:39.160 align:start position:0%
less than $10,000 I think um I guess
 
02:33:42.750 --> 02:33:42.760 align:start position:0%
that depends somewhat on uh some of the
 
02:33:44.030 --> 02:33:44.040 align:start position:0%
language in the bill and how it's
 
02:33:47.790 --> 02:33:47.800 align:start position:0%
interpreted the um particularly the um
 
02:33:51.269 --> 02:33:51.279 align:start position:0%
clause about the bill sh include excuse
 
02:33:54.830 --> 02:33:54.840 align:start position:0%
me uh the bill shall also contain
 
02:33:57.550 --> 02:33:57.560 align:start position:0%
include a notation stating the tax
 
02:34:00.830 --> 02:34:00.840 align:start position:0%
calculation um if we're talking about
 
02:34:02.990 --> 02:34:03.000 align:start position:0%
just including an amount there it's it
 
02:34:04.590 --> 02:34:04.600 align:start position:0%
seems like the issue is comparing
 
02:34:06.110 --> 02:34:06.120 align:start position:0%
previous years to the current year if
 
02:34:07.790 --> 02:34:07.800 align:start position:0%
we're just talking about including an
 
02:34:09.630 --> 02:34:09.640 align:start position:0%
amount like the millage from last year
 
02:34:12.349 --> 02:34:12.359 align:start position:0%
versus this year that's a reasonably
 
02:34:15.750 --> 02:34:15.760 align:start position:0%
straightforward uh change if by um
 
02:34:17.750 --> 02:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
including the actual tax calculation
 
02:34:20.110 --> 02:34:20.120 align:start position:0%
where we have to do out all the math um
 
02:34:22.070 --> 02:34:22.080 align:start position:0%
I have sample tax bills here if anybody
 
02:34:24.469 --> 02:34:24.479 align:start position:0%
wish to see them but it does become an
 
02:34:26.590 --> 02:34:26.600 align:start position:0%
issue of space and some of that
 
02:34:29.309 --> 02:34:29.319 align:start position:0%
information uh may not be available at
 
02:34:31.269 --> 02:34:31.279 align:start position:0%
the time of printing the tax bill so it
 
02:34:33.349 --> 02:34:33.359 align:start position:0%
would require significant software
 
02:34:37.550 --> 02:34:37.560 align:start position:0%
changes uh that you know it's it most of
 
02:34:40.630 --> 02:34:40.640 align:start position:0%
our towns we we uh Provide support under
 
02:34:42.670 --> 02:34:42.680 align:start position:0%
annual contracts there are occasionally
 
02:34:44.510 --> 02:34:44.520 align:start position:0%
things that are so significant that we
 
02:34:46.990 --> 02:34:47.000 align:start position:0%
do have to invoice them separately it's
 
02:34:50.510 --> 02:34:50.520 align:start position:0%
difficult to to know how uh significant
 
02:34:52.269 --> 02:34:52.279 align:start position:0%
an impact that would be just based on
 
02:34:55.230 --> 02:34:55.240 align:start position:0%
the language of um stating the tax
 
02:34:57.389 --> 02:34:57.399 align:start position:0%
calculation is is what I see in the
 
02:34:59.830 --> 02:34:59.840 align:start position:0%
draft um similarly the effective
 
02:35:02.910 --> 02:35:02.920 align:start position:0%
year-over-year rate change it again has
 
02:35:05.590 --> 02:35:05.600 align:start position:0%
to do with um how that needs to be
 
02:35:07.990 --> 02:35:08.000 align:start position:0%
represented U on the tax bill if it's
 
02:35:11.590 --> 02:35:11.600 align:start position:0%
just a you know we show it's your county
 
02:35:14.230 --> 02:35:14.240 align:start position:0%
rate is a122 this year and last year it
 
02:35:14.240 --> 02:35:14.950 align:start position:0%
rate is a122 this year and last year it
was

02:35:14.950 --> 02:35:14.960 align:start position:0%
was
 
02:35:17.950 --> 02:35:17.960 align:start position:0%
the11 if that satisfies the requirement
 
02:35:20.110 --> 02:35:20.120 align:start position:0%
that's reasonably straightforward if we
 
02:35:22.950 --> 02:35:22.960 align:start position:0%
need to go in and calculate everybody's
 
02:35:25.150 --> 02:35:25.160 align:start position:0%
nominal amount for this is what they
 
02:35:28.510 --> 02:35:28.520 align:start position:0%
paid last year in a total County um you
 
02:35:29.950 --> 02:35:29.960 align:start position:0%
know you paid
 
02:35:33.990 --> 02:35:34.000 align:start position:0%
$27 and you paid $214 to the county that
 
02:35:36.550 --> 02:35:36.560 align:start position:0%
becomes a more significant change and
 
02:35:39.190 --> 02:35:39.200 align:start position:0%
obviously more expensive um I think
 
02:35:42.830 --> 02:35:42.840 align:start position:0%
those are the two primary uh concerns I
 
02:35:45.870 --> 02:35:45.880 align:start position:0%
I imagine they're um fairly easily
 
02:35:49.190 --> 02:35:49.200 align:start position:0%
addressed um if we're just showing what
 
02:35:51.030 --> 02:35:51.040 align:start position:0%
was the tax rate last year and what was
 
02:35:53.590 --> 02:35:53.600 align:start position:0%
the tax rate this year on that millage
 
02:35:56.150 --> 02:35:56.160 align:start position:0%
um and or even as a percentage increase
 
02:35:59.790 --> 02:35:59.800 align:start position:0%
or decrease in theory um but but the
 
02:36:02.230 --> 02:36:02.240 align:start position:0%
idea that the uh bill would show the
 
02:36:04.230 --> 02:36:04.240 align:start position:0%
full calculation actually do the math
 
02:36:06.910 --> 02:36:06.920 align:start position:0%
for people would represent a significant
 
02:36:09.469 --> 02:36:09.479 align:start position:0%
change um I think that addresses our
 
02:36:12.230 --> 02:36:12.240 align:start position:0%
main uh concerns and I'd be happy to
 
02:36:19.870 --> 02:36:19.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:19.880 --> 02:36:21.550 align:start position:0%
 
representative

02:36:21.550 --> 02:36:21.560 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:36:24.070 --> 02:36:24.080 align:start position:0%
Dolan thank you madam chair and uh thank
 
02:36:26.349 --> 02:36:26.359 align:start position:0%
you for coming to
 
02:36:31.630 --> 02:36:31.640 align:start position:0%
testify uh before us uh unfortunately um
 
02:36:34.510 --> 02:36:34.520 align:start position:0%
the sponsor and the four co-sponsors
 
02:36:36.870 --> 02:36:36.880 align:start position:0%
failed to show up which puts the
 
02:36:39.150 --> 02:36:39.160 align:start position:0%
committee at a severe disadvantage of
 
02:36:41.030 --> 02:36:41.040 align:start position:0%
understanding the bill understanding the
 
02:36:44.830 --> 02:36:44.840 align:start position:0%
Genesis behind it and uh giving us an
 
02:36:48.750 --> 02:36:48.760 align:start position:0%
ability to interact with and question uh
 
02:36:51.590 --> 02:36:51.600 align:start position:0%
the bill so sure I'm very happy that
 
02:36:55.469 --> 02:36:55.479 align:start position:0%
you're here uh and unfortunately the the
 
02:36:58.830 --> 02:36:58.840 align:start position:0%
uh the uh the concern for for this bill
 
02:37:00.150 --> 02:37:00.160 align:start position:0%
obviously it's not shared by the
 
02:37:05.070 --> 02:37:05.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:07.990 --> 02:37:08.000 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor what was was there a question
 
02:37:09.550 --> 02:37:09.560 align:start position:0%
in there
 
02:37:14.510 --> 02:37:14.520 align:start position:0%
or no okay well the question is do you
 
02:37:16.830 --> 02:37:16.840 align:start position:0%
know how the sponsors or co-sponsors
 
02:37:18.429 --> 02:37:18.439 align:start position:0%
feel about this bill since we can't
 
02:37:20.349 --> 02:37:20.359 align:start position:0%
question them
 
02:37:24.870 --> 02:37:24.880 align:start position:0%
I I don't sir I I I was uh forwarded an
 
02:37:27.590 --> 02:37:27.600 align:start position:0%
email a couple days ago uh for a list
 
02:37:30.230 --> 02:37:30.240 align:start position:0%
ser and asked uh if this would have any
 
02:37:32.190 --> 02:37:32.200 align:start position:0%
significant impacts on software support
 
02:37:36.630 --> 02:37:36.640 align:start position:0%
so that's that's right all I know thank
 
02:37:39.269 --> 02:37:39.279 align:start position:0%
you um representative Walker yes thank
 
02:37:43.230 --> 02:37:43.240 align:start position:0%
you madam chair uh you spoke to your
 
02:37:46.590 --> 02:37:46.600 align:start position:0%
your uh software Avatar system y space
 
02:37:49.190 --> 02:37:49.200 align:start position:0%
is limited on uh on bills that go out to
 
02:37:53.309 --> 02:37:53.319 align:start position:0%
the public and I do know
 
02:37:56.750 --> 02:37:56.760 align:start position:0%
vision and you got uh Patriot you got
 
02:37:59.030 --> 02:37:59.040 align:start position:0%
Universe those are the older ones that
 
02:38:00.990 --> 02:38:01.000 align:start position:0%
don't have any flexibility at all and
 
02:38:02.870 --> 02:38:02.880 align:start position:0%
adding this would be a great deal
 
02:38:07.030 --> 02:38:07.040 align:start position:0%
expense to the communities and sometimes
 
02:38:07.040 --> 02:38:08.150 align:start position:0%
expense to the communities and sometimes
in

02:38:08.150 --> 02:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:38:10.870 --> 02:38:10.880 align:start position:0%
addition if some of these tax rates that
 
02:38:13.950 --> 02:38:13.960 align:start position:0%
don't uh like for instance Rochester
 
02:38:15.389 --> 02:38:15.399 align:start position:0%
last year we didn't get our tax bills
 
02:38:17.190 --> 02:38:17.200 align:start position:0%
out till late
 
02:38:19.710 --> 02:38:19.720 align:start position:0%
December so you're not going to have of
 
02:38:22.230 --> 02:38:22.240 align:start position:0%
this so is that going to be a very a
 
02:38:23.990 --> 02:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
problem with getting the tax B you know
 
02:38:25.670 --> 02:38:25.680 align:start position:0%
with the information on the
 
02:38:28.190 --> 02:38:28.200 align:start position:0%
tax I'm not sure the the timing of it
 
02:38:29.790 --> 02:38:29.800 align:start position:0%
matters that the tax bills can't really
 
02:38:32.030 --> 02:38:32.040 align:start position:0%
go out until the rates are set so at the
 
02:38:33.830 --> 02:38:33.840 align:start position:0%
time the tax bills are printed we would
 
02:38:37.110 --> 02:38:37.120 align:start position:0%
know those rates um whether it's you
 
02:38:39.309 --> 02:38:39.319 align:start position:0%
know uh not till the end of December or
 
02:38:42.190 --> 02:38:42.200 align:start position:0%
in November or whatever but the it's
 
02:38:45.590 --> 02:38:45.600 align:start position:0%
it's the the space issue is just how
 
02:38:47.269 --> 02:38:47.279 align:start position:0%
much information we need to put on there
 
02:38:48.590 --> 02:38:48.600 align:start position:0%
again the concern would be that we have
 
02:38:51.110 --> 02:38:51.120 align:start position:0%
to either um and it's also a calculation
 
02:38:54.110 --> 02:38:54.120 align:start position:0%
issue that if we need to um follow
 
02:38:55.950 --> 02:38:55.960 align:start position:0%
through the distinct amounts of
 
02:38:57.830 --> 02:38:57.840 align:start position:0%
everybody's individual Bill the
 
02:38:59.870 --> 02:38:59.880 align:start position:0%
components of the county the state the
 
02:39:01.950 --> 02:39:01.960 align:start position:0%
local Ed all those all the way through
 
02:39:04.910 --> 02:39:04.920 align:start position:0%
the system that require that at least in
 
02:39:06.710 --> 02:39:06.720 align:start position:0%
our case would require some significant
 
02:39:09.030 --> 02:39:09.040 align:start position:0%
changes in costs which we would then be
 
02:39:11.309 --> 02:39:11.319 align:start position:0%
looking to pass on to municipalities as
 
02:39:12.950 --> 02:39:12.960 align:start position:0%
well with the other older systems
 
02:39:15.630 --> 02:39:15.640 align:start position:0%
presumably I I I can't speak for them
 
02:39:18.070 --> 02:39:18.080 align:start position:0%
but I I would imagine they would have
 
02:39:20.469 --> 02:39:20.479 align:start position:0%
similar concerns um sorry one other
 
02:39:21.870 --> 02:39:21.880 align:start position:0%
thing that that your question reminded
 
02:39:23.150 --> 02:39:23.160 align:start position:0%
me of
 
02:39:26.630 --> 02:39:26.640 align:start position:0%
that the I mentioned about 160
 
02:39:30.150 --> 02:39:30.160 align:start position:0%
municipalities use the software um some
 
02:39:32.030 --> 02:39:32.040 align:start position:0%
significant portion of those actually
 
02:39:35.469 --> 02:39:35.479 align:start position:0%
send a file that our system exports out
 
02:39:38.429 --> 02:39:38.439 align:start position:0%
to a thirdparty printing service which
 
02:39:40.190 --> 02:39:40.200 align:start position:0%
they can then stuff and print and get a
 
02:39:42.269 --> 02:39:42.279 align:start position:0%
little cheaper postage rate stuff like
 
02:39:45.870 --> 02:39:45.880 align:start position:0%
that so beyond the cost just to us and
 
02:39:48.830 --> 02:39:48.840 align:start position:0%
our municipalities there would be some
 
02:39:51.190 --> 02:39:51.200 align:start position:0%
add-on cost possibly they could be
 
02:39:53.510 --> 02:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
nominal they could be expensive I don't
 
02:39:56.190 --> 02:39:56.200 align:start position:0%
know for those thirdparty print mail
 
02:39:59.030 --> 02:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
services that each town that sends those
 
02:40:01.830 --> 02:40:01.840 align:start position:0%
out would have to revisit with them and
 
02:40:03.990 --> 02:40:04.000 align:start position:0%
say now the bill that we've been
 
02:40:05.670 --> 02:40:05.680 align:start position:0%
printing based on the information we
 
02:40:08.590 --> 02:40:08.600 align:start position:0%
send you for the last 10 years we got to
 
02:40:10.469 --> 02:40:10.479 align:start position:0%
go through and redo that process and
 
02:40:12.950 --> 02:40:12.960 align:start position:0%
proof and and change those templates so
 
02:40:16.070 --> 02:40:16.080 align:start position:0%
that could be a another cost that these
 
02:40:18.389 --> 02:40:18.399 align:start position:0%
towns might experience if that makes
 
02:40:21.670 --> 02:40:21.680 align:start position:0%
sense thank you thank you further
 
02:40:24.389 --> 02:40:24.399 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thanks
 
02:40:26.710 --> 02:40:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:30.510 --> 02:40:30.520 align:start position:0%
time last pink card that I have um chair
 
02:40:43.510 --> 02:40:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:50.550 --> 02:40:50.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:53.990 --> 02:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Madame chair and committee
 
02:40:56.269 --> 02:40:56.279 align:start position:0%
members my name is Eric power I'm from
 
02:40:58.990 --> 02:40:59.000 align:start position:0%
Brookline representing myself and I'm in
 
02:41:01.429 --> 02:41:01.439 align:start position:0%
favor of House Bill
 
02:41:04.710 --> 02:41:04.720 align:start position:0%
495 um I think this is a good bill there
 
02:41:06.429 --> 02:41:06.439 align:start position:0%
may be a couple of things I wanted to
 
02:41:09.230 --> 02:41:09.240 align:start position:0%
talk about with this bill um I think
 
02:41:11.190 --> 02:41:11.200 align:start position:0%
having the breakdown is
 
02:41:11.200 --> 02:41:13.510 align:start position:0%
having the breakdown is
important

02:41:13.510 --> 02:41:13.520 align:start position:0%
important
 
02:41:16.670 --> 02:41:16.680 align:start position:0%
um but I think I I'd suggest a couple of
 
02:41:18.830 --> 02:41:18.840 align:start position:0%
things that you maybe you'd want to do
 
02:41:21.510 --> 02:41:21.520 align:start position:0%
to provide transparency and if you feel
 
02:41:24.550 --> 02:41:24.560 align:start position:0%
that this bill is too hard to put on the
 
02:41:27.110 --> 02:41:27.120 align:start position:0%
tax bill one thing that could be done
 
02:41:28.830 --> 02:41:28.840 align:start position:0%
alternatively is maybe make this
 
02:41:30.910 --> 02:41:30.920 align:start position:0%
available on each Town's Municipal
 
02:41:32.790 --> 02:41:32.800 align:start position:0%
website if you feel like you don't want
 
02:41:34.230 --> 02:41:34.240 align:start position:0%
to put it on the bill because I think
 
02:41:35.950 --> 02:41:35.960 align:start position:0%
that would also be a place where people
 
02:41:37.990 --> 02:41:38.000 align:start position:0%
could do it and maybe they just get a
 
02:41:41.510 --> 02:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
link on their bill to more details so
 
02:41:42.950 --> 02:41:42.960 align:start position:0%
they could actually type it in and see
 
02:41:44.269 --> 02:41:44.279 align:start position:0%
it that would be another way to do it if
 
02:41:45.550 --> 02:41:45.560 align:start position:0%
it's going to be too much to actually
 
02:41:48.349 --> 02:41:48.359 align:start position:0%
put it on the bill but I would um
 
02:41:50.269 --> 02:41:50.279 align:start position:0%
recommend on the Bill where it talks
 
02:41:50.279 --> 02:41:52.510 align:start position:0%
recommend on the Bill where it talks
about

02:41:52.510 --> 02:41:52.520 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:41:55.269 --> 02:41:55.279 align:start position:0%
um talks it doesn't talk about Village
 
02:41:57.830 --> 02:41:57.840 align:start position:0%
districts there it says the rate on line
 
02:41:59.790 --> 02:41:59.800 align:start position:0%
four it says the rate for municipal I
 
02:42:01.910 --> 02:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
would add comma Village District by each
 
02:42:03.190 --> 02:42:03.200 align:start position:0%
district if you have more than one
 
02:42:04.429 --> 02:42:04.439 align:start position:0%
Village District it would be nice to
 
02:42:07.710 --> 02:42:07.720 align:start position:0%
know how much each would be um for local
 
02:42:10.190 --> 02:42:10.200 align:start position:0%
education there are some some towns that
 
02:42:11.990 --> 02:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
have multiple school districts and it's
 
02:42:13.510 --> 02:42:13.520 align:start position:0%
always nice to know how much is going to
 
02:42:16.429 --> 02:42:16.439 align:start position:0%
each so local education by School
 
02:42:18.670 --> 02:42:18.680 align:start position:0%
District State education by School
 
02:42:19.950 --> 02:42:19.960 align:start position:0%
District again if you have multiple
 
02:42:22.550 --> 02:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
districts there's multiple U taxes going
 
02:42:23.670 --> 02:42:23.680 align:start position:0%
for each
 
02:42:26.389 --> 02:42:26.399 align:start position:0%
one um and then also the in the in the
 
02:42:30.190 --> 02:42:30.200 align:start position:0%
numbers you know two three and five
 
02:42:32.990 --> 02:42:33.000 align:start position:0%
below just say uh individually for each
 
02:42:34.670 --> 02:42:34.680 align:start position:0%
School District or individually for each
 
02:42:37.349 --> 02:42:37.359 align:start position:0%
Village District um I think it's
 
02:42:39.230 --> 02:42:39.240 align:start position:0%
important because I know people like in
 
02:42:41.030 --> 02:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
my town we have two school districts and
 
02:42:42.150 --> 02:42:42.160 align:start position:0%
people want to know how much are we
 
02:42:43.510 --> 02:42:43.520 align:start position:0%
spending for the Brookline School
 
02:42:44.990 --> 02:42:45.000 align:start position:0%
District versus how much we spending for
 
02:42:47.870 --> 02:42:47.880 align:start position:0%
our Co-op and it's not published on our
 
02:42:50.269 --> 02:42:50.279 align:start position:0%
website it's not published on bill you
 
02:42:52.110 --> 02:42:52.120 align:start position:0%
have to call the sa up and hopefully
 
02:42:53.870 --> 02:42:53.880 align:start position:0%
they're they like you enough to actually
 
02:42:57.190 --> 02:42:57.200 align:start position:0%
give you that information um and then
 
02:42:58.750 --> 02:42:58.760 align:start position:0%
they can tell you what the breakdown is
 
02:43:00.469 --> 02:43:00.479 align:start position:0%
between your two school districts for
 
02:43:02.550 --> 02:43:02.560 align:start position:0%
both your local education taxes and your
 
02:43:05.389 --> 02:43:05.399 align:start position:0%
State education taxes it's somebody
 
02:43:07.190 --> 02:43:07.200 align:start position:0%
knows it it's just not being published
 
02:43:09.150 --> 02:43:09.160 align:start position:0%
it's not out there and that's not very
 
02:43:11.990 --> 02:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
helpful sometimes so I would recommend
 
02:43:14.389 --> 02:43:14.399 align:start position:0%
either passing this bill uh with the
 
02:43:17.190 --> 02:43:17.200 align:start position:0%
Amendments I talked about putting it on
 
02:43:21.190 --> 02:43:21.200 align:start position:0%
the tax bill or taking this bill and
 
02:43:22.830 --> 02:43:22.840 align:start position:0%
changing it into one where they have to
 
02:43:26.070 --> 02:43:26.080 align:start position:0%
disclose this information uh publicly on
 
02:43:28.469 --> 02:43:28.479 align:start position:0%
their website and maybe post it in a you
 
02:43:30.469 --> 02:43:30.479 align:start position:0%
know public place I think that would go
 
02:43:33.630 --> 02:43:33.640 align:start position:0%
a long way for people to understand um
 
02:43:36.190 --> 02:43:36.200 align:start position:0%
where their taxes are going and how much
 
02:43:38.710 --> 02:43:38.720 align:start position:0%
it's costing them especially by breaking
 
02:43:40.550 --> 02:43:40.560 align:start position:0%
it down by individual Village districts
 
02:43:43.990 --> 02:43:44.000 align:start position:0%
and individual uh school districts and
 
02:43:47.110 --> 02:43:47.120 align:start position:0%
for that I I would recommend otpa on
 
02:43:49.750 --> 02:43:49.760 align:start position:0%
House Bill 495 and I would take any
 
02:43:49.760 --> 02:43:53.990 align:start position:0%
House Bill 495 and I would take any
questions

02:43:53.990 --> 02:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:56.190 --> 02:43:56.200 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
02:44:03.429 --> 02:44:03.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:06.269 --> 02:44:06.279 align:start position:0%
amendment are you asking the speaker or
 
02:44:09.190 --> 02:44:09.200 align:start position:0%
me well yes you just said
 
02:44:12.349 --> 02:44:12.359 align:start position:0%
otpa I would my you do not have an
 
02:44:14.309 --> 02:44:14.319 align:start position:0%
amendment I'm just suggesting things
 
02:44:16.190 --> 02:44:16.200 align:start position:0%
that you might want to consider when the
 
02:44:18.550 --> 02:44:18.560 align:start position:0%
committee looks at it and things that I
 
02:44:19.750 --> 02:44:19.760 align:start position:0%
thought were
 
02:44:22.870 --> 02:44:22.880 align:start position:0%
things that could be uh make it better
 
02:44:25.550 --> 02:44:25.560 align:start position:0%
representative stavis followup yes thank
 
02:44:27.630 --> 02:44:27.640 align:start position:0%
you madam chair and thank you for taking
 
02:44:30.510 --> 02:44:30.520 align:start position:0%
my followup but the prime sponsor is not
 
02:44:33.590 --> 02:44:33.600 align:start position:0%
here so it would be inappropriate for us
 
02:44:36.790 --> 02:44:36.800 align:start position:0%
to well we can't ask him if he would be
 
02:44:38.429 --> 02:44:38.439 align:start position:0%
amendable to an amendment because he's
 
02:44:38.439 --> 02:44:40.190 align:start position:0%
amendable to an amendment because he's
not

02:44:40.190 --> 02:44:40.200 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:44:42.790 --> 02:44:42.800 align:start position:0%
here thank you representative I believe
 
02:44:44.590 --> 02:44:44.600 align:start position:0%
once the bill is in committee the
 
02:44:46.830 --> 02:44:46.840 align:start position:0%
committee owns the bill and they can do
 
02:44:49.670 --> 02:44:49.680 align:start position:0%
with what they feel they need to
 
02:44:52.150 --> 02:44:52.160 align:start position:0%
and this being a snowy day on a vacation
 
02:44:53.750 --> 02:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
week I think there's a little bit of an
 
02:44:55.750 --> 02:44:55.760 align:start position:0%
extenuating circumstance but that's just
 
02:44:58.230 --> 02:44:58.240 align:start position:0%
my perspective thank
 
02:45:01.230 --> 02:45:01.240 align:start position:0%
you further
 
02:45:04.990 --> 02:45:05.000 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank
 
02:45:08.630 --> 02:45:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:12.230 --> 02:45:12.240 align:start position:0%
sheet oh um no I'm
 
02:45:16.990 --> 02:45:17.000 align:start position:0%
sorry I I I I received a pink card just
 
02:45:20.830 --> 02:45:20.840 align:start position:0%
recently so the last pink that I have um
 
02:45:23.469 --> 02:45:23.479 align:start position:0%
is from Mr Brody
 
02:45:25.830 --> 02:45:25.840 align:start position:0%
Dees welcome back to Municipal and
 
02:45:28.309 --> 02:45:28.319 align:start position:0%
County government it was in my hand I
 
02:45:29.910 --> 02:45:29.920 align:start position:0%
just had in my head that was the last
 
02:45:32.469 --> 02:45:32.479 align:start position:0%
speaker I apologize I think um I think
 
02:45:34.269 --> 02:45:34.279 align:start position:0%
that's been the general operating today
 
02:45:36.070 --> 02:45:36.080 align:start position:0%
um I nearly forgot to put in my pin card
 
02:45:39.070 --> 02:45:39.080 align:start position:0%
though I thought I already did um my
 
02:45:40.910 --> 02:45:40.920 align:start position:0%
name is Brody Des I represent the New
 
02:45:43.870 --> 02:45:43.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Municipal Association and um
 
02:45:46.790 --> 02:45:46.800 align:start position:0%
we are opposed to House Bill 495 as it's
 
02:45:49.670 --> 02:45:49.680 align:start position:0%
been currently introduced um so tax
 
02:45:52.150 --> 02:45:52.160 align:start position:0%
bills go out quarterly or by annually
 
02:45:53.710 --> 02:45:53.720 align:start position:0%
and the tax rate fluctuates throughout
 
02:45:55.070 --> 02:45:55.080 align:start position:0%
the year based on the amount of Revenue
 
02:45:56.990 --> 02:45:57.000 align:start position:0%
approved and and necessary to be raised
 
02:45:58.910 --> 02:45:58.920 align:start position:0%
to meet the expenses and expenditures
 
02:46:01.429 --> 02:46:01.439 align:start position:0%
and also the amount of unassigned fund
 
02:46:03.230 --> 02:46:03.240 align:start position:0%
balance might be utilized to buy down
 
02:46:05.510 --> 02:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
the tax rate depending on whether or not
 
02:46:07.790 --> 02:46:07.800 align:start position:0%
municipality is allowed to carry over um
 
02:46:10.150 --> 02:46:10.160 align:start position:0%
unassigned fund balance and I do want to
 
02:46:11.990 --> 02:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
point out that the tax rate changes from
 
02:46:14.510 --> 02:46:14.520 align:start position:0%
your first bill to your second Bill and
 
02:46:17.670 --> 02:46:17.680 align:start position:0%
um and again impacted by uh by how much
 
02:46:19.389 --> 02:46:19.399 align:start position:0%
of your unassigned fund balance may buy
 
02:46:21.790 --> 02:46:21.800 align:start position:0%
down your tax rate um and this you don't
 
02:46:23.110 --> 02:46:23.120 align:start position:0%
know this amount of money until you're
 
02:46:24.349 --> 02:46:24.359 align:start position:0%
finished with your audit most
 
02:46:25.790 --> 02:46:25.800 align:start position:0%
municipalities do their audit during the
 
02:46:28.030 --> 02:46:28.040 align:start position:0%
summer months um this matters because it
 
02:46:30.790 --> 02:46:30.800 align:start position:0%
shows kind of an imperfect uh picture of
 
02:46:33.030 --> 02:46:33.040 align:start position:0%
how spending is increasing or decreasing
 
02:46:34.590 --> 02:46:34.600 align:start position:0%
year-over-year looking at these
 
02:46:36.870 --> 02:46:36.880 align:start position:0%
different rates at the different times
 
02:46:39.469 --> 02:46:39.479 align:start position:0%
um it it doesn't it doesn't consider
 
02:46:41.630 --> 02:46:41.640 align:start position:0%
also reassessments that will decrease
 
02:46:43.550 --> 02:46:43.560 align:start position:0%
the tax rate and property taxpayers may
 
02:46:45.230 --> 02:46:45.240 align:start position:0%
be led to believe that their tax bill
 
02:46:48.070 --> 02:46:48.080 align:start position:0%
will be less um you know as much as many
 
02:46:50.469 --> 02:46:50.479 align:start position:0%
of us in this room May understand how
 
02:46:51.870 --> 02:46:51.880 align:start position:0%
assessments are done how the money is
 
02:46:53.750 --> 02:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
raised how that impacts the rates how
 
02:46:55.710 --> 02:46:55.720 align:start position:0%
the total spending impacts your rate how
 
02:46:57.590 --> 02:46:57.600 align:start position:0%
reevaluations there's a requirement that
 
02:46:59.670 --> 02:46:59.680 align:start position:0%
as your property values go up that the
 
02:47:01.950 --> 02:47:01.960 align:start position:0%
rate needs proportionately decrease uh
 
02:47:03.790 --> 02:47:03.800 align:start position:0%
many of our taxpayers are not as well
 
02:47:06.389 --> 02:47:06.399 align:start position:0%
versed in um in the understanding of how
 
02:47:09.230 --> 02:47:09.240 align:start position:0%
Dr sets the rates and how really it's
 
02:47:11.150 --> 02:47:11.160 align:start position:0%
spending that impacts your overall tax
 
02:47:14.469 --> 02:47:14.479 align:start position:0%
bill not always your tax
 
02:47:16.830 --> 02:47:16.840 align:start position:0%
rate tax collectors and assessors would
 
02:47:18.269 --> 02:47:18.279 align:start position:0%
also need to update their software to
 
02:47:19.670 --> 02:47:19.680 align:start position:0%
abide by this mandate and we're
 
02:47:21.550 --> 02:47:21.560 align:start position:0%
uncertain if the software providers can
 
02:47:23.269 --> 02:47:23.279 align:start position:0%
make these updates um you just heard
 
02:47:25.710 --> 02:47:25.720 align:start position:0%
from Avatar previously um it's uncertain
 
02:47:27.190 --> 02:47:27.200 align:start position:0%
whether or not them or there are other
 
02:47:28.910 --> 02:47:28.920 align:start position:0%
software providers would actually be
 
02:47:30.750 --> 02:47:30.760 align:start position:0%
able to update their software in an
 
02:47:32.110 --> 02:47:32.120 align:start position:0%
affordable way for municipalities to be
 
02:47:34.030 --> 02:47:34.040 align:start position:0%
able to implement this mandate um
 
02:47:35.870 --> 02:47:35.880 align:start position:0%
updating and changing the software also
 
02:47:38.510 --> 02:47:38.520 align:start position:0%
cost municipalities um depending on the
 
02:47:40.070 --> 02:47:40.080 align:start position:0%
size of municipality it could be pretty
 
02:47:41.510 --> 02:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
expensive smaller ones it could be less
 
02:47:43.830 --> 02:47:43.840 align:start position:0%
expensive um the bill is also kind of
 
02:47:45.269 --> 02:47:45.279 align:start position:0%
unclear about where this information
 
02:47:48.070 --> 02:47:48.080 align:start position:0%
would go on the tax bill um and tax
 
02:47:49.349 --> 02:47:49.359 align:start position:0%
bills are already getting getting quite
 
02:47:51.469 --> 02:47:51.479 align:start position:0%
busy and some municipalities also will
 
02:47:53.550 --> 02:47:53.560 align:start position:0%
include other information in their uh
 
02:47:54.910 --> 02:47:54.920 align:start position:0%
that they include when they send out the
 
02:47:57.550 --> 02:47:57.560 align:start position:0%
tax bills as an increase of transparency
 
02:48:00.429 --> 02:48:00.439 align:start position:0%
in in uh in the municipality um we think
 
02:48:01.950 --> 02:48:01.960 align:start position:0%
adding you know more mandated
 
02:48:03.429 --> 02:48:03.439 align:start position:0%
information especially information that
 
02:48:04.990 --> 02:48:05.000 align:start position:0%
not may not paint the most perfect
 
02:48:06.750 --> 02:48:06.760 align:start position:0%
picture of how people's tax bills are
 
02:48:09.030 --> 02:48:09.040 align:start position:0%
going to be impacted um it might just
 
02:48:11.630 --> 02:48:11.640 align:start position:0%
create more confusion additionally and
 
02:48:12.990 --> 02:48:13.000 align:start position:0%
you know we appreciate hearing the the
 
02:48:15.070 --> 02:48:15.080 align:start position:0%
previous testimony point out that um the
 
02:48:17.910 --> 02:48:17.920 align:start position:0%
term Precinct is um that's not really
 
02:48:19.870 --> 02:48:19.880 align:start position:0%
anywhere in our state statutes uh we
 
02:48:22.150 --> 02:48:22.160 align:start position:0%
think it probably the intent was Village
 
02:48:23.870 --> 02:48:23.880 align:start position:0%
District although as pointed out the
 
02:48:25.670 --> 02:48:25.680 align:start position:0%
sponsors aren't here to clarify the
 
02:48:28.590 --> 02:48:28.600 align:start position:0%
intent um and town it would probably be
 
02:48:31.710 --> 02:48:31.720 align:start position:0%
better to be said Municipal because our
 
02:48:33.910 --> 02:48:33.920 align:start position:0%
assumption is and again we can't clarify
 
02:48:35.790 --> 02:48:35.800 align:start position:0%
the intent um because the sponsors
 
02:48:38.349 --> 02:48:38.359 align:start position:0%
aren't here but Municipal would be
 
02:48:40.110 --> 02:48:40.120 align:start position:0%
better because that would also include
 
02:48:43.670 --> 02:48:43.680 align:start position:0%
cities um with that I'll take any
 
02:48:45.150 --> 02:48:45.160 align:start position:0%
questions should the committee have any
 
02:48:47.030 --> 02:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
and I appreciate you guys taking my
 
02:48:50.550 --> 02:48:50.560 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you other any
 
02:48:53.309 --> 02:48:53.319 align:start position:0%
questions I had one quick question I I
 
02:48:55.110 --> 02:48:55.120 align:start position:0%
noticed that there's a fiscal note and
 
02:48:56.670 --> 02:48:56.680 align:start position:0%
that the New Hampshire Municipal
 
02:49:00.790 --> 02:49:00.800 align:start position:0%
Association was contacted by the LBA and
 
02:49:04.309 --> 02:49:04.319 align:start position:0%
so they determined that the fiscal
 
02:49:06.710 --> 02:49:06.720 align:start position:0%
impact would be less than
 
02:49:09.110 --> 02:49:09.120 align:start position:0%
$10,000 that's per municipality and do
 
02:49:12.309 --> 02:49:12.319 align:start position:0%
you have any more detailed information
 
02:49:15.070 --> 02:49:15.080 align:start position:0%
that obviously that's an estimate I'll
 
02:49:16.750 --> 02:49:16.760 align:start position:0%
double check but um I don't think we're
 
02:49:19.190 --> 02:49:19.200 align:start position:0%
contacted for a um a fiscal note and
 
02:49:20.309 --> 02:49:20.319 align:start position:0%
there's been a couple of bills where
 
02:49:21.750 --> 02:49:21.760 align:start position:0%
that's happened where it's been
 
02:49:24.030 --> 02:49:24.040 align:start position:0%
indicated we were or they used a tax
 
02:49:25.830 --> 02:49:25.840 align:start position:0%
impact from a previous bill that was
 
02:49:28.990 --> 02:49:29.000 align:start position:0%
similar and so we you know and at least
 
02:49:30.309 --> 02:49:30.319 align:start position:0%
they've noted on some of those tax
 
02:49:32.469 --> 02:49:32.479 align:start position:0%
impacts where it's been like similar
 
02:49:34.510 --> 02:49:34.520 align:start position:0%
bills that it was a you know fiscal note
 
02:49:36.790 --> 02:49:36.800 align:start position:0%
from us for maybe like 2021 for example
 
02:49:38.910 --> 02:49:38.920 align:start position:0%
was one bill that I saw so I can follow
 
02:49:40.670 --> 02:49:40.680 align:start position:0%
up and see if our person who does the
 
02:49:42.750 --> 02:49:42.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal notes Marty Carlin he was with
 
02:49:44.950 --> 02:49:44.960 align:start position:0%
the retirement system if he did but you
 
02:49:46.389 --> 02:49:46.399 align:start position:0%
know I think when I last spoke to him
 
02:49:48.190 --> 02:49:48.200 align:start position:0%
about this he was it was not of his
 
02:49:50.309 --> 02:49:50.319 align:start position:0%
knowledge we were contacted and maybe we
 
02:49:52.110 --> 02:49:52.120 align:start position:0%
were and went to spam or something and
 
02:49:55.870 --> 02:49:55.880 align:start position:0%
so we can provide Clarity
 
02:49:59.150 --> 02:49:59.160 align:start position:0%
okay so from NH I was more interested in
 
02:50:01.309 --> 02:50:01.319 align:start position:0%
the 10,000
 
02:50:04.389 --> 02:50:04.399 align:start position:0%
um that number it's saying that the
 
02:50:09.510 --> 02:50:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:11.950 --> 02:50:11.960 align:start position:0%
10,000 yeah I mean it's a pretty vague
 
02:50:13.469 --> 02:50:13.479 align:start position:0%
fiscal note because it's not saying
 
02:50:17.630 --> 02:50:17.640 align:start position:0%
who's going to be impacted by $10,000 um
 
02:50:18.870 --> 02:50:18.880 align:start position:0%
my knowledge is there could
 
02:50:20.950 --> 02:50:20.960 align:start position:0%
municipalities that would be impacted by
 
02:50:23.469 --> 02:50:23.479 align:start position:0%
more than that um and I'm also unsure
 
02:50:26.630 --> 02:50:26.640 align:start position:0%
why they're using the years 2025 through
 
02:50:28.990 --> 02:50:29.000 align:start position:0%
2028 um I'm wondering if it's similar to
 
02:50:30.910 --> 02:50:30.920 align:start position:0%
representative Bernard's Bill where this
 
02:50:33.870 --> 02:50:33.880 align:start position:0%
is not the fiscal note that should be
 
02:50:35.670 --> 02:50:35.680 align:start position:0%
accompanying this bill yeah those were
 
02:50:37.150 --> 02:50:37.160 align:start position:0%
the things I was wondering about thank
 
02:50:39.830 --> 02:50:39.840 align:start position:0%
you any further
 
02:50:43.510 --> 02:50:43.520 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
 
02:50:45.990 --> 02:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
you so at this time I will ask is there
 
02:50:47.830 --> 02:50:47.840 align:start position:0%
anyone present who wishes to speak on
 
02:50:49.469 --> 02:50:49.479 align:start position:0%
this bill who has not not yet had the
 
02:50:53.070 --> 02:50:53.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity to do so seeing none the
 
02:50:55.670 --> 02:50:55.680 align:start position:0%
vice chairman will report out the blue
 
02:51:00.790 --> 02:51:00.800 align:start position:0%
sheet on HB 495 we have one uh signature

sheet on HB 495 we have one uh signature
in

02:51:07.070 --> 02:51:07.080 align:start position:0%
support thank you and with that I will
 
02:51:09.389 --> 02:51:09.399 align:start position:0%
close the public hearing on House Bill

04:07:15.670 --> 04:07:15.680 align:start position:0%
setting reduced default budget
 
04:07:18.710 --> 04:07:18.720 align:start position:0%
options um and this bill enables local
 
04:07:20.630 --> 04:07:20.640 align:start position:0%
political subdivisions that have adopted
 
04:07:23.309 --> 04:07:23.319 align:start position:0%
the official ballot referendum form of
 
04:07:25.389 --> 04:07:25.399 align:start position:0%
meaning to adopt Provisions for an
 
04:07:29.550 --> 04:07:29.560 align:start position:0%
annual choice for a reduced default
 
04:07:32.870 --> 04:07:32.880 align:start position:0%
budget the reason for the bill is to
 
04:07:36.830 --> 04:07:36.840 align:start position:0%
give uh towns more options as far as
 
04:07:42.189 --> 04:07:42.199 align:start position:0%
control over their uh School budgets and
 
04:07:45.030 --> 04:07:45.040 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
04:07:47.870 --> 04:07:47.880 align:start position:0%
because that's been an issue uh
 
04:07:51.790 --> 04:07:51.800 align:start position:0%
Statewide um and so we're looking at
 
04:07:54.870 --> 04:07:54.880 align:start position:0%
this as one more uh sort of financial
 
04:07:58.630 --> 04:07:58.640 align:start position:0%
tool in the toolkit for uh providing U
 
04:08:00.870 --> 04:08:00.880 align:start position:0%
more control over
 
04:08:03.630 --> 04:08:03.640 align:start position:0%
spending um and there'll be others uh
 
04:08:06.750 --> 04:08:06.760 align:start position:0%
after me that um have a little more
 
04:08:09.790 --> 04:08:09.800 align:start position:0%
information and can speak to the bill
 
04:08:11.870 --> 04:08:11.880 align:start position:0%
probably a little bit better than I so
 
04:08:13.950 --> 04:08:13.960 align:start position:0%
um with that I'm
 
04:08:15.990 --> 04:08:16.000 align:start position:0%
I'm going to leave it at that you all
 
04:08:18.710 --> 04:08:18.720 align:start position:0%
probably want to get home on the snowy
 
04:08:22.389 --> 04:08:22.399 align:start position:0%
day so thank you representative are you
 
04:08:24.229 --> 04:08:24.239 align:start position:0%
willing to take questions I can try to
 
04:08:26.149 --> 04:08:26.159 align:start position:0%
yes are there questions for
 
04:08:28.990 --> 04:08:29.000 align:start position:0%
representative Harvey
 
04:08:31.630 --> 04:08:31.640 align:start position:0%
bolia representative grund is recognized
 
04:08:33.950 --> 04:08:33.960 align:start position:0%
for a question thank you madam chair and
 
04:08:36.269 --> 04:08:36.279 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um so
 
04:08:38.670 --> 04:08:38.680 align:start position:0%
in here the third option is you would
 
04:08:41.710 --> 04:08:41.720 align:start position:0%
reduce the default budget by a
 
04:08:45.030 --> 04:08:45.040 align:start position:0%
percentage so what happens if a default
 
04:08:47.309 --> 04:08:47.319 align:start position:0%
budget that's reduced by a percentage
 
04:08:49.389 --> 04:08:49.399 align:start position:0%
doesn't allow let's say a school
 
04:08:51.309 --> 04:08:51.319 align:start position:0%
district to meet some
 
04:08:54.630 --> 04:08:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:57.189 --> 04:08:57.199 align:start position:0%
happens um yes I'm gonna leave that
 
04:09:00.590 --> 04:09:00.600 align:start position:0%
question I'm GNA for um others behind me
 
04:09:03.429 --> 04:09:03.439 align:start position:0%
that are kind of more aware of that sort
 
04:09:06.630 --> 04:09:06.640 align:start position:0%
of the details pertaining to that
 
04:09:06.640 --> 04:09:07.950 align:start position:0%
of the details pertaining to that
further

04:09:07.950 --> 04:09:07.960 align:start position:0%
further
 
04:09:10.790 --> 04:09:10.800 align:start position:0%
questions I'm gonna seeing none thank
 
04:09:14.070 --> 04:09:14.080 align:start position:0%
you thank you next the chair
 
04:09:18.830 --> 04:09:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:21.229 --> 04:09:21.239 align:start position:0%
power good afternoon and welcome to
 
04:09:24.309 --> 04:09:24.319 align:start position:0%

welcome um thank you for the uh for the
 
04:09:31.630 --> 04:09:31.640 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak to you Municipal
 
04:09:33.670 --> 04:09:33.680 align:start position:0%
and County government committee my name
 
04:09:35.950 --> 04:09:35.960 align:start position:0%
is Eric power I am from the town of
 
04:09:37.670 --> 04:09:37.680 align:start position:0%
Brookline representing myself in favor
 
04:09:42.109 --> 04:09:42.119 align:start position:0%
of this bill I previously served as the
 
04:09:43.870 --> 04:09:43.880 align:start position:0%
uh as a school board m in the Hollis
 
04:09:45.309 --> 04:09:45.319 align:start position:0%
book line Cooperative school district
 
04:09:47.429 --> 04:09:47.439 align:start position:0%
for three years and I've been active in
 
04:09:47.439 --> 04:09:48.790 align:start position:0%
for three years and I've been active in
town

04:09:48.790 --> 04:09:48.800 align:start position:0%
town
 
04:09:51.189 --> 04:09:51.199 align:start position:0%
um um in town meetings and in school
 
04:09:52.750 --> 04:09:52.760 align:start position:0%
district meetings I'm also the president
 
04:09:54.030 --> 04:09:54.040 align:start position:0%
of the school district governance
 
04:09:56.429 --> 04:09:56.439 align:start position:0%
Association of New Hampshire so this
 
04:09:59.389 --> 04:09:59.399 align:start position:0%
bill is providing another option for
 
04:10:01.389 --> 04:10:01.399 align:start position:0%
those towns and school districts that
 
04:10:05.590 --> 04:10:05.600 align:start position:0%
have adopted the SP2 form of meeting to
 
04:10:09.149 --> 04:10:09.159 align:start position:0%
um every year you have a operating
 
04:10:11.229 --> 04:10:11.239 align:start position:0%
budget warrant article which has a
 
04:10:13.309 --> 04:10:13.319 align:start position:0%
proposed budget and then a uh default
 
04:10:16.550 --> 04:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
default budget and what's been happening
 
04:10:18.189 --> 04:10:18.199 align:start position:0%
in a lot of towns and school districts
 
04:10:19.950 --> 04:10:19.960 align:start position:0%
across the state is that those budgets
 
04:10:21.630 --> 04:10:21.640 align:start position:0%
are almost the same it's almost
 
04:10:23.109 --> 04:10:23.119 align:start position:0%
everything makes it in the default
 
04:10:25.070 --> 04:10:25.080 align:start position:0%
budget and the difference between the
 
04:10:28.469 --> 04:10:28.479 align:start position:0%
default budget and the operating budget
 
04:10:31.269 --> 04:10:31.279 align:start position:0%
um is very small and sometimes even the
 
04:10:33.990 --> 04:10:34.000 align:start position:0%
default budget might be larger um
 
04:10:35.469 --> 04:10:35.479 align:start position:0%
because of the way the law works and I
 
04:10:37.469 --> 04:10:37.479 align:start position:0%
know there's other bills coming up later
 
04:10:40.030 --> 04:10:40.040 align:start position:0%
today to talk about the default budget
 
04:10:42.710 --> 04:10:42.720 align:start position:0%
but this bill here um is enabling
 
04:10:42.720 --> 04:10:44.349 align:start position:0%
but this bill here um is enabling
legislation

04:10:44.349 --> 04:10:44.359 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
04:10:47.389 --> 04:10:47.399 align:start position:0%
that is adopted by a 3th vote of the
 
04:10:49.030 --> 04:10:49.040 align:start position:0%
school district or the town whoever
 
04:10:51.630 --> 04:10:51.640 align:start position:0%
whichever political subdivision wants it
 
04:10:54.550 --> 04:10:54.560 align:start position:0%
and what what it does is it provides an
 
04:10:54.560 --> 04:10:55.830 align:start position:0%
and what what it does is it provides an
annual

04:10:55.830 --> 04:10:55.840 align:start position:0%
annual
 
04:10:59.389 --> 04:10:59.399 align:start position:0%
choice for a reduced default budget
 
04:11:02.670 --> 04:11:02.680 align:start position:0%
should the proposed budget fail so when
 
04:11:06.469 --> 04:11:06.479 align:start position:0%
you adopt this legislation you choose a
 
04:11:10.269 --> 04:11:10.279 align:start position:0%
percentage between one and 10% and you
 
04:11:11.830 --> 04:11:11.840 align:start position:0%
adopt that percent so let's say you
 
04:11:13.750 --> 04:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
picked 5%
 
04:11:15.750 --> 04:11:15.760 align:start position:0%
and if the three- fifths of the voters
 
04:11:17.830 --> 04:11:17.840 align:start position:0%
vote for that then you have this option
 
04:11:21.630 --> 04:11:21.640 align:start position:0%
each year so each year you what what
 
04:11:25.790 --> 04:11:25.800 align:start position:0%
goes on the SP SP2 ballot is the um
 
04:11:27.910 --> 04:11:27.920 align:start position:0%
operating proposed operating budget as
 
04:11:29.910 --> 04:11:29.920 align:start position:0%
one warn article in one
 
04:11:33.550 --> 04:11:33.560 align:start position:0%
question um which is in the bill on
 
04:11:36.389 --> 04:11:36.399 align:start position:0%
lines 8 to
 
04:11:38.830 --> 04:11:38.840 align:start position:0%
11 and then you have a second one
 
04:11:42.750 --> 04:11:42.760 align:start position:0%
immediately afterwards which says if the
 
04:11:45.670 --> 04:11:45.680 align:start position:0%
uh if the proposed operating budget
 
04:11:49.269 --> 04:11:49.279 align:start position:0%
fails you have an option to accept the
 
04:11:52.910 --> 04:11:52.920 align:start position:0%
default budget if you vote Yes or if you
 
04:11:55.710 --> 04:11:55.720 align:start position:0%
vote no then you get the default budget
 
04:11:58.149 --> 04:11:58.159 align:start position:0%
reduced by the 5% the number that was
 
04:12:01.109 --> 04:12:01.119 align:start position:0%
picked when it was adopted and each year
 
04:12:03.469 --> 04:12:03.479 align:start position:0%
that's a question the voters can decide
 
04:12:05.790 --> 04:12:05.800 align:start position:0%
for themselves on the ballot so from
 
04:12:07.389 --> 04:12:07.399 align:start position:0%
year to year they'll have if they've
 
04:12:09.830 --> 04:12:09.840 align:start position:0%
adopted it at 5% they would get that 5%
 
04:12:13.670 --> 04:12:13.680 align:start position:0%
reduction option each year so
 
04:12:16.429 --> 04:12:16.439 align:start position:0%
um the provision can be rescinded as
 
04:12:18.429 --> 04:12:18.439 align:start position:0%
well if you do not like how it's working
 
04:12:20.149 --> 04:12:20.159 align:start position:0%
for your town or School District you can
 
04:12:23.590 --> 04:12:23.600 align:start position:0%
resend it with a 3- fths vote as well um
 
04:12:25.550 --> 04:12:25.560 align:start position:0%
it could be put on the warrant by the
 
04:12:27.309 --> 04:12:27.319 align:start position:0%
governing body or by
 
04:12:29.510 --> 04:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
petition and there's some hearing
 
04:12:31.189 --> 04:12:31.199 align:start position:0%
requirements that you normally have with
 
04:12:34.469 --> 04:12:34.479 align:start position:0%
tax caps and other types of things and
 
04:12:36.670 --> 04:12:36.680 align:start position:0%
there's statutory language for adopting
 
04:12:41.389 --> 04:12:41.399 align:start position:0%
it to um answer the question about what
 
04:12:45.670 --> 04:12:45.680 align:start position:0%
happens if the um if you've adopted this
 
04:12:48.389 --> 04:12:48.399 align:start position:0%
and if you have defeated the proposed
 
04:12:50.030 --> 04:12:50.040 align:start position:0%
budget and then you get to the default
 
04:12:51.710 --> 04:12:51.720 align:start position:0%
budget and
 
04:12:54.229 --> 04:12:54.239 align:start position:0%
somebody's that that fails and then you
 
04:12:57.070 --> 04:12:57.080 align:start position:0%
get the say the example the reduced
 
04:12:58.630 --> 04:12:58.640 align:start position:0%
default budget of
 
04:13:01.349 --> 04:13:01.359 align:start position:0%
5% that will be the operating budget for
 
04:13:04.309 --> 04:13:04.319 align:start position:0%
that year and now somebody's going to
 
04:13:05.750 --> 04:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
maybe say well we can't meet our
 
04:13:09.349 --> 04:13:09.359 align:start position:0%
commitments so meeting your commitments
 
04:13:11.269 --> 04:13:11.279 align:start position:0%
I think you have to look at your town or
 
04:13:12.670 --> 04:13:12.680 align:start position:0%
your school district and determine
 
04:13:15.070 --> 04:13:15.080 align:start position:0%
what's really really needed and what you
 
04:13:19.269 --> 04:13:19.279 align:start position:0%
absolutely can't go without um and in
 
04:13:21.870 --> 04:13:21.880 align:start position:0%
that case if that gets to that point
 
04:13:23.429 --> 04:13:23.439 align:start position:0%
where you really can't cut anything that
 
04:13:25.590 --> 04:13:25.600 align:start position:0%
you don't think you can you can you can
 
04:13:27.750 --> 04:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
petition Superior Court for a special
 
04:13:30.389 --> 04:13:30.399 align:start position:0%
meeting to appropriate funds if it
 
04:13:34.309 --> 04:13:34.319 align:start position:0%
really comes to that option um so that
 
04:13:36.389 --> 04:13:36.399 align:start position:0%
would be the path if you can't live
 
04:13:38.269 --> 04:13:38.279 align:start position:0%
within the reduced default budget that
 
04:13:41.070 --> 04:13:41.080 align:start position:0%
the voters give you it's not any
 
04:13:43.389 --> 04:13:43.399 align:start position:0%
different than smaller budgets today in
 
04:13:46.189 --> 04:13:46.199 align:start position:0%
a traditional meeting um there was a in
 
04:13:48.229 --> 04:13:48.239 align:start position:0%
a traditional meeting in cin there was a
 
04:13:50.710 --> 04:13:50.720 align:start position:0%
a budget that was chopped by about
 
04:13:52.670 --> 04:13:52.680 align:start position:0%
55% and they were going to have to live
 
04:13:54.269 --> 04:13:54.279 align:start position:0%
with that they ended up holding a second
 
04:13:56.389 --> 04:13:56.399 align:start position:0%
meeting with a more than 50% turnout and
 
04:13:58.070 --> 04:13:58.080 align:start position:0%
Chang that outcome but if they hadn't
 
04:14:00.590 --> 04:14:00.600 align:start position:0%
done that they may have had to go
 
04:14:04.189 --> 04:14:04.199 align:start position:0%
petition for a uh special meeting in
 
04:14:06.389 --> 04:14:06.399 align:start position:0%
order to uh get the money they needed
 
04:14:09.109 --> 04:14:09.119 align:start position:0%
minimally and the court would decide but
 
04:14:10.309 --> 04:14:10.319 align:start position:0%
that's how that would work but this
 
04:14:13.269 --> 04:14:13.279 align:start position:0%
really uh what's the purpose here is to
 
04:14:15.229 --> 04:14:15.239 align:start position:0%
allow the school districts in the towns
 
04:14:17.469 --> 04:14:17.479 align:start position:0%
to provide themselves another option
 
04:14:18.950 --> 04:14:18.960 align:start position:0%
when they have a tough year and they
 
04:14:21.790 --> 04:14:21.800 align:start position:0%
can't afford more property taxes this
 
04:14:23.389 --> 04:14:23.399 align:start position:0%
gives another option besides just
 
04:14:25.910 --> 04:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
accepting the default budget they will
 
04:14:28.149 --> 04:14:28.159 align:start position:0%
then have another option to get a
 
04:14:29.950 --> 04:14:29.960 align:start position:0%
slightly lower budget and the most that
 
04:14:33.710 --> 04:14:33.720 align:start position:0%
can be reduced by is 10% by the by the
 
04:14:36.670 --> 04:14:36.680 align:start position:0%
by the way the language is right now so
 
04:14:39.389 --> 04:14:39.399 align:start position:0%
with that I'll uh conclude my testimony
 
04:14:44.030 --> 04:14:44.040 align:start position:0%
I recommend passage of HP 630 1 I hope
 
04:14:46.229 --> 04:14:46.239 align:start position:0%
you recommend it a to pass and I'll take
 
04:14:50.429 --> 04:14:50.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:54.349 --> 04:14:54.359 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you oh I'm
 
04:14:56.910 --> 04:14:56.920 align:start position:0%
sorry I need to look left right and then
 
04:15:00.550 --> 04:15:00.560 align:start position:0%
left again okay um the chair recognizes
 
04:15:03.309 --> 04:15:03.319 align:start position:0%
representative grundt thank you madam
 
04:15:05.269 --> 04:15:05.279 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for my question so
 
04:15:07.950 --> 04:15:07.960 align:start position:0%
my my previous question was about the if
 
04:15:09.269 --> 04:15:09.279 align:start position:0%
you can't meet your legal obligations
 
04:15:10.790 --> 04:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
and reason I bring that up is I am part
 
04:15:13.870 --> 04:15:13.880 align:start position:0%
of a school district $21 million budget
 
04:15:17.189 --> 04:15:17.199 align:start position:0%
we typically have2 $300,000 left at the
 
04:15:18.830 --> 04:15:18.840 align:start position:0%
end of the year at
 
04:15:22.389 --> 04:15:22.399 align:start position:0%
most I take off 5% off of our budget we
 
04:15:24.189 --> 04:15:24.199 align:start position:0%
would now not be able to meet our legal
 
04:15:27.269 --> 04:15:27.279 align:start position:0%
obligations that is my concern and I
 
04:15:31.030 --> 04:15:31.040 align:start position:0%
would say if you look at many
 
04:15:34.309 --> 04:15:34.319 align:start position:0%
schools they're trying to keep things as
 
04:15:39.590 --> 04:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
Slim as possible um they're not trying
 
04:15:39.600 --> 04:15:41.189 align:start position:0%
Slim as possible um they're not trying
to

04:15:41.189 --> 04:15:41.199 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:15:43.349 --> 04:15:43.359 align:start position:0%
overextend and so my question question
 
04:15:47.109 --> 04:15:47.119 align:start position:0%
goes to why would why would we do a
 
04:15:48.630 --> 04:15:48.640 align:start position:0%
percentage when people have the
 
04:15:51.790 --> 04:15:51.800 align:start position:0%
opportunity to show up at deliberative
 
04:15:55.109 --> 04:15:55.119 align:start position:0%
sessions if you're in sb2 town to change
 
04:15:57.710 --> 04:15:57.720 align:start position:0%
things at that point the making three is
 
04:16:00.469 --> 04:16:00.479 align:start position:0%
that confusing to people thank you for
 
04:16:01.950 --> 04:16:01.960 align:start position:0%
the question I don't think it's a
 
04:16:04.990 --> 04:16:05.000 align:start position:0%
confusing um question I think it's it's
 
04:16:07.990 --> 04:16:08.000 align:start position:0%
a I think it it will cause school
 
04:16:10.670 --> 04:16:10.680 align:start position:0%
districts to have a more prudent budget
 
04:16:12.189 --> 04:16:12.199 align:start position:0%
that that people can live with when
 
04:16:13.590 --> 04:16:13.600 align:start position:0%
they're proposing it and when they're
 
04:16:16.349 --> 04:16:16.359 align:start position:0%
negotiating it at a deliberative session
 
04:16:19.910 --> 04:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
I think that in the case of uh a small
 
04:16:22.750 --> 04:16:22.760 align:start position:0%
reduction you may have to cut some
 
04:16:25.070 --> 04:16:25.080 align:start position:0%
amount of services it may mean you have
 
04:16:27.229 --> 04:16:27.239 align:start position:0%
to reduce Staffing of some level you
 
04:16:29.910 --> 04:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
might have to reduce a program but you
 
04:16:32.070 --> 04:16:32.080 align:start position:0%
know there's a balancing act between you
 
04:16:34.309 --> 04:16:34.319 align:start position:0%
know what the taxpayers can afford and
 
04:16:36.630 --> 04:16:36.640 align:start position:0%
what the school district thinks it has
 
04:16:39.309 --> 04:16:39.319 align:start position:0%
to do and what has to be offered so it's
 
04:16:41.109 --> 04:16:41.119 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a tough call and it you know
 
04:16:43.109 --> 04:16:43.119 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of opinions on that so
 
04:16:46.389 --> 04:16:46.399 align:start position:0%
this is just another option for instead
 
04:16:49.309 --> 04:16:49.319 align:start position:0%
of just accepting the default which also
 
04:16:51.389 --> 04:16:51.399 align:start position:0%
seems to increase every year it gives
 
04:16:54.189 --> 04:16:54.199 align:start position:0%
another path to getting to a more
 
04:16:56.630 --> 04:16:56.640 align:start position:0%
prudent budget and it's something that
 
04:16:59.149 --> 04:16:59.159 align:start position:0%
each district and town can decide for
 
04:17:03.030 --> 04:17:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:09.109 --> 04:17:09.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:14.469 --> 04:17:14.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:16.750 --> 04:17:16.760 align:start position:0%
and the last pin card that I have is Mr
 
04:17:16.760 --> 04:17:20.630 align:start position:0%
and the last pin card that I have is Mr
Brody

04:17:20.630 --> 04:17:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:23.510 --> 04:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
Dees good afternoon and welcome back to
 
04:17:24.910 --> 04:17:24.920 align:start position:0%
Municipal and County
 
04:17:26.870 --> 04:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
government good afternoon thank you
 
04:17:28.389 --> 04:17:28.399 align:start position:0%
madam chairwoman and thank you to the uh
 
04:17:29.710 --> 04:17:29.720 align:start position:0%
committee for letting me speak my name
 
04:17:31.590 --> 04:17:31.600 align:start position:0%
is Brody Dees I represent the New
 
04:17:34.109 --> 04:17:34.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Municipal Association and um
 
04:17:36.149 --> 04:17:36.159 align:start position:0%
we are currently as it's drafted we are
 
04:17:41.830 --> 04:17:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:45.389 --> 04:17:45.399 align:start position:0%
613 get my notes here so House Bill 613
 
04:17:47.030 --> 04:17:47.040 align:start position:0%
allows the adoption of an alternative
 
04:17:49.990 --> 04:17:50.000 align:start position:0%
reduced budget um that only adjusts by a
 
04:17:51.750 --> 04:17:51.760 align:start position:0%
percentage of spending rather than using
 
04:17:53.429 --> 04:17:53.439 align:start position:0%
the current calculations the current
 
04:17:54.790 --> 04:17:54.800 align:start position:0%
calculations and I won't read the whole
 
04:17:56.309 --> 04:17:56.319 align:start position:0%
section but they're spelled out in RSA
 
04:18:00.910 --> 04:18:00.920 align:start position:0%
40 col 13 uh ran 9 subsection B titled
 
04:18:02.870 --> 04:18:02.880 align:start position:0%
default budget and explains the exact
 
04:18:05.309 --> 04:18:05.319 align:start position:0%
calculation process for default budgets
 
04:18:07.510 --> 04:18:07.520 align:start position:0%
um current law accounts for increased
 
04:18:09.349 --> 04:18:09.359 align:start position:0%
contractual cost the municipality must
 
04:18:11.550 --> 04:18:11.560 align:start position:0%
raise revenues for and pay this to make
 
04:18:13.469 --> 04:18:13.479 align:start position:0%
sure that all their contractors the cbas
 
04:18:15.229 --> 04:18:15.239 align:start position:0%
that they have to pay those employees
 
04:18:17.469 --> 04:18:17.479 align:start position:0%
for all those contractual obligations
 
04:18:19.870 --> 04:18:19.880 align:start position:0%
can be fulfilled um this is because
 
04:18:23.189 --> 04:18:23.199 align:start position:0%
obviously in SP2 towns you can't stay um
 
04:18:25.030 --> 04:18:25.040 align:start position:0%
for the entire town meeting until you
 
04:18:27.670 --> 04:18:27.680 align:start position:0%
pass a budget and um and the voters
 
04:18:29.389 --> 04:18:29.399 align:start position:0%
don't deliberate throughout the entire
 
04:18:30.910 --> 04:18:30.920 align:start position:0%
time at the second session they go and
 
04:18:32.349 --> 04:18:32.359 align:start position:0%
they vote and so if they vote down a
 
04:18:33.389 --> 04:18:33.399 align:start position:0%
budget you need to make sure that there
 
04:18:34.950 --> 04:18:34.960 align:start position:0%
is some workable budget for
 
04:18:36.550 --> 04:18:36.560 align:start position:0%
municipalities or school districts to
 
04:18:38.429 --> 04:18:38.439 align:start position:0%
have where they can fulfill all their
 
04:18:38.439 --> 04:18:39.590 align:start position:0%
have where they can fulfill all their
financial

04:18:39.590 --> 04:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
financial
 
04:18:42.910 --> 04:18:42.920 align:start position:0%
obligations um we do want to flag that
 
04:18:44.950 --> 04:18:44.960 align:start position:0%
the percentage that could be inserted um
 
04:18:47.429 --> 04:18:47.439 align:start position:0%
if a municipality were to adopt this um
 
04:18:49.389 --> 04:18:49.399 align:start position:0%
it could be very arbitrary and become a
 
04:18:51.750 --> 04:18:51.760 align:start position:0%
significant impediment to promoting the
 
04:18:53.910 --> 04:18:53.920 align:start position:0%
uh to effective and well-functioning
 
04:18:55.389 --> 04:18:55.399 align:start position:0%
municipal government I mean if all of a
 
04:18:57.229 --> 04:18:57.239 align:start position:0%
sudden you say well you know the default
 
04:18:59.229 --> 04:18:59.239 align:start position:0%
budget um now is a reduction from the
 
04:19:01.870 --> 04:19:01.880 align:start position:0%
previous year of 10% um it would be
 
04:19:03.149 --> 04:19:03.159 align:start position:0%
extremely difficult for many
 
04:19:05.109 --> 04:19:05.119 align:start position:0%
municipalities to continue operating and
 
04:19:06.469 --> 04:19:06.479 align:start position:0%
to fulfill all their financial
 
04:19:08.830 --> 04:19:08.840 align:start position:0%
obligations um you would see a cut in
 
04:19:11.229 --> 04:19:11.239 align:start position:0%
Services you would see a decrease in how
 
04:19:13.429 --> 04:19:13.439 align:start position:0%
effective they're able to serve their
 
04:19:15.469 --> 04:19:15.479 align:start position:0%
constituents um and without this
 
04:19:19.189 --> 04:19:19.199 align:start position:0%
limitation um you know that could have
 
04:19:22.469 --> 04:19:22.479 align:start position:0%
um you know significant negative impacts
 
04:19:23.910 --> 04:19:23.920 align:start position:0%
not just on the municipalities but on
 
04:19:26.309 --> 04:19:26.319 align:start position:0%
the residents of those municipalities um
 
04:19:27.670 --> 04:19:27.680 align:start position:0%
and this is also part of the reason why
 
04:19:29.670 --> 04:19:29.680 align:start position:0%
the default calculations exist is to
 
04:19:32.429 --> 04:19:32.439 align:start position:0%
ensure when voters are against increased
 
04:19:34.030 --> 04:19:34.040 align:start position:0%
spending that the municipality can meet
 
04:19:35.389 --> 04:19:35.399 align:start position:0%
its obligations and doesn't have to
 
04:19:38.030 --> 04:19:38.040 align:start position:0%
necessarily cut Services significantly
 
04:19:40.590 --> 04:19:40.600 align:start position:0%
um there is a calculation that um that
 
04:19:43.149 --> 04:19:43.159 align:start position:0%
you know everyone kind of can gener
 
04:19:45.870 --> 04:19:45.880 align:start position:0%
agree upon that is you know can be
 
04:19:47.950 --> 04:19:47.960 align:start position:0%
workable for municipalities even if they
 
04:19:49.590 --> 04:19:49.600 align:start position:0%
go into default budget for multiple
 
04:19:50.510 --> 04:19:50.520 align:start position:0%
years while that might have a
 
04:19:53.070 --> 04:19:53.080 align:start position:0%
compounding effect um our opinion would
 
04:19:55.229 --> 04:19:55.239 align:start position:0%
be that this uh arbitrary percentage
 
04:19:58.229 --> 04:19:58.239 align:start position:0%
would further um that uh that
 
04:19:59.750 --> 04:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
compounding effect in a much more
 
04:20:02.030 --> 04:20:02.040 align:start position:0%
dramatic way if municipalities were to
 
04:20:04.389 --> 04:20:04.399 align:start position:0%
go into multiple default budgets um this
 
04:20:05.910 --> 04:20:05.920 align:start position:0%
process could also become complicated
 
04:20:07.590 --> 04:20:07.600 align:start position:0%
for voters because of the contingencies
 
04:20:09.030 --> 04:20:09.040 align:start position:0%
that must happen I mean you have to vote
 
04:20:11.349 --> 04:20:11.359 align:start position:0%
first against your budget and then you'd
 
04:20:13.670 --> 04:20:13.680 align:start position:0%
have to vote to at least our knowledge
 
04:20:16.710 --> 04:20:16.720 align:start position:0%
to support the red reduced default
 
04:20:18.149 --> 04:20:18.159 align:start position:0%
budget so now you're kind of trying to
 
04:20:20.830 --> 04:20:20.840 align:start position:0%
vote down two different budgets and our
 
04:20:22.389 --> 04:20:22.399 align:start position:0%
opinion would be that that's a that's a
 
04:20:23.670 --> 04:20:23.680 align:start position:0%
pretty steep learning curve for the
 
04:20:25.830 --> 04:20:25.840 align:start position:0%
average voters I mean s SP2 itself for
 
04:20:27.550 --> 04:20:27.560 align:start position:0%
many voters was a learning curve to add
 
04:20:28.870 --> 04:20:28.880 align:start position:0%
a whole new way that we're going to be
 
04:20:31.910 --> 04:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
calculating default budgets um you know
 
04:20:33.510 --> 04:20:33.520 align:start position:0%
that that could be troubling
 
04:20:34.790 --> 04:20:34.800 align:start position:0%
additionally I want to point out that in
 
04:20:36.469 --> 04:20:36.479 align:start position:0%
RSA 40 colon
 
04:20:38.990 --> 04:20:39.000 align:start position:0%
14-b um title default budget determined
 
04:20:41.269 --> 04:20:41.279 align:start position:0%
by the budget committee this statute
 
04:20:42.910 --> 04:20:42.920 align:start position:0%
already provides for an existing local
 
04:20:44.349 --> 04:20:44.359 align:start position:0%
option for voters to allow the budget
 
04:20:46.189 --> 04:20:46.199 align:start position:0%
committee to propose alternative uh
 
04:20:48.630 --> 04:20:48.640 align:start position:0%
default budgets so there actually is a
 
04:20:50.349 --> 04:20:50.359 align:start position:0%
process in state law where the governing
 
04:20:52.189 --> 04:20:52.199 align:start position:0%
body can present a budget to the
 
04:20:54.149 --> 04:20:54.159 align:start position:0%
legislative body and say hey we didn't
 
04:20:55.510 --> 04:20:55.520 align:start position:0%
agree with the select board you know if
 
04:20:57.229 --> 04:20:57.239 align:start position:0%
you have a statutory budget committee um
 
04:20:58.630 --> 04:20:58.640 align:start position:0%
we think that the default budget should
 
04:21:00.349 --> 04:21:00.359 align:start position:0%
actually be this this year and it's a
 
04:21:02.269 --> 04:21:02.279 align:start position:0%
legislative body that ultimately would
 
04:21:03.910 --> 04:21:03.920 align:start position:0%
uh would approve and allow for the
 
04:21:05.950 --> 04:21:05.960 align:start position:0%
governing body to have that power um we
 
04:21:07.790 --> 04:21:07.800 align:start position:0%
also want to point out that the adoption
 
04:21:09.870 --> 04:21:09.880 align:start position:0%
threshold is also not in line with the
 
04:21:12.149 --> 04:21:12.159 align:start position:0%
existing tax cap law it would move a lot
 
04:21:14.030 --> 04:21:14.040 align:start position:0%
of these things to a super majority at
 
04:21:15.950 --> 04:21:15.960 align:start position:0%
least in our reading um which is a
 
04:21:18.070 --> 04:21:18.080 align:start position:0%
little bit concerning too so you know we
 
04:21:19.269 --> 04:21:19.279 align:start position:0%
we think if a majority of the
 
04:21:20.790 --> 04:21:20.800 align:start position:0%
legislative body decides it's going to
 
04:21:23.630 --> 04:21:23.640 align:start position:0%
appropriate um you know money for for
 
04:21:25.550 --> 04:21:25.560 align:start position:0%
specific purposes or approve a budget
 
04:21:28.349 --> 04:21:28.359 align:start position:0%
that um that the majority should rule um
 
04:21:30.950 --> 04:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
and with that I will take any questions
 
04:21:32.389 --> 04:21:32.399 align:start position:0%
and I thank you for taking my testimony
 
04:21:36.630 --> 04:21:36.640 align:start position:0%

in your in your reading of the bill is
 
04:21:49.790 --> 04:21:49.800 align:start position:0%
there anything that prevents this from
 
04:21:52.550 --> 04:21:52.560 align:start position:0%
happening year-over-year
 
04:21:56.910 --> 04:21:56.920 align:start position:0%
is there do you mean by voters
 
04:21:59.790 --> 04:21:59.800 align:start position:0%
approving A reduced default budget and
 
04:22:02.189 --> 04:22:02.199 align:start position:0%
alternative default budget correct no
 
04:22:04.630 --> 04:22:04.640 align:start position:0%
there's nothing to prevent
 
04:22:09.030 --> 04:22:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:11.590 --> 04:22:11.600 align:start position:0%

Ron dun from lary I'm here today to
 
04:46:36.230 --> 04:46:36.240 align:start position:0%
sponsor this bill that would change the
 
04:46:37.708 --> 04:46:37.718 align:start position:0%
way we calculate the default budget here
 
04:46:39.030 --> 04:46:39.040 align:start position:0%
in New
 
04:46:41.310 --> 04:46:41.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire a default budget in simple
 
04:46:43.030 --> 04:46:43.040 align:start position:0%
terms is based on the previous year's
 
04:46:44.868 --> 04:46:44.878 align:start position:0%
operating budget with adjustments for
 
04:46:47.670 --> 04:46:47.680 align:start position:0%
default contracts and other
 
04:46:49.750 --> 04:46:49.760 align:start position:0%
obligations theault budget has been the
 
04:46:52.350 --> 04:46:52.360 align:start position:0%
topic of discussion in many towns for
 
04:46:54.750 --> 04:46:54.760 align:start position:0%
years no one seems to like it but no one
 
04:46:57.350 --> 04:46:57.360 align:start position:0%
seems to know a better way this bill
 
04:47:00.548 --> 04:47:00.558 align:start position:0%
takes issue of using onfi employee
 
04:47:02.270 --> 04:47:02.280 align:start position:0%
positions to fund other areas of the
 
04:47:04.548 --> 04:47:04.558 align:start position:0%
budget that would eliminate this
 
04:47:06.670 --> 04:47:06.680 align:start position:0%
practice when I first told fellow
 
04:47:08.470 --> 04:47:08.480 align:start position:0%
Representatives fellow Town counselors
 
04:47:10.350 --> 04:47:10.360 align:start position:0%

knows where to
 
04:47:21.910 --> 04:47:21.920 align:start position:0%

04:47:28.190 --> 04:47:28.200 align:start position:0%
worms well here I am to fight this to
 
04:47:31.110 --> 04:47:31.120 align:start position:0%
fix this broken budgeting system an
 
04:47:33.590 --> 04:47:33.600 align:start position:0%
example of the issues this bill will fix
 
04:47:35.350 --> 04:47:35.360 align:start position:0%
is using unfilled positions to fund
 
04:47:38.270 --> 04:47:38.280 align:start position:0%
other areas of the budget departments
 
04:47:40.270 --> 04:47:40.280 align:start position:0%
will not hire onfi positions so they can
 
04:47:41.590 --> 04:47:41.600 align:start position:0%
use this money money to pay for other
 
04:47:43.510 --> 04:47:43.520 align:start position:0%
areas of the budget that may be
 
04:47:45.390 --> 04:47:45.400 align:start position:0%
underfunded or
 
04:47:48.788 --> 04:47:48.798 align:start position:0%
overspent this practice needs to end if
 
04:47:50.030 --> 04:47:50.040 align:start position:0%
the position is needed it should be
 
04:47:52.750 --> 04:47:52.760 align:start position:0%
filled if it is not it should be
 
04:47:54.750 --> 04:47:54.760 align:start position:0%
eliminated when the residents go to the
 
04:47:56.948 --> 04:47:56.958 align:start position:0%
polls to vote they are voting on what
 
04:47:59.230 --> 04:47:59.240 align:start position:0%
they believe is in the budget they are
 
04:48:01.390 --> 04:48:01.400 align:start position:0%
not saying that department heads this
 
04:48:02.750 --> 04:48:02.760 align:start position:0%
gives you a slush fund that allows you
 
04:48:07.990 --> 04:48:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:10.150 --> 04:48:10.160 align:start position:0%
categories this also allows the town to
 
04:48:11.510 --> 04:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
spend on other the things that are not
 
04:48:12.510 --> 04:48:12.520 align:start position:0%
in the
 
04:48:14.670 --> 04:48:14.680 align:start position:0%
budget this practice can lead to
 
04:48:17.628 --> 04:48:17.638 align:start position:0%
inefficiency and wasteful spending it
 
04:48:19.110 --> 04:48:19.120 align:start position:0%
also leads to lack of trust and
 
04:48:20.510 --> 04:48:20.520 align:start position:0%
transparency in
 
04:48:22.708 --> 04:48:22.718 align:start position:0%
government the fixes on proposing
 
04:48:24.150 --> 04:48:24.160 align:start position:0%
legislation will not solve all the
 
04:48:26.750 --> 04:48:26.760 align:start position:0%
problems with the default budget system
 
04:48:27.708 --> 04:48:27.718 align:start position:0%
but they are moves in the right
 
04:48:29.628 --> 04:48:29.638 align:start position:0%
direction the default budget is
 
04:48:31.590 --> 04:48:31.600 align:start position:0%
complicated needs to be fixed and
 
04:48:33.708 --> 04:48:33.718 align:start position:0%
reworked this is one step in the right
 
04:48:35.708 --> 04:48:35.718 align:start position:0%
direction to fix a broken budgeting
 
04:48:38.230 --> 04:48:38.240 align:start position:0%
system thank you madam chairman for this
 
04:48:40.270 --> 04:48:40.280 align:start position:0%
Committee in the time this afternoon
 
04:48:42.150 --> 04:48:42.160 align:start position:0%
there are speakers behind me with much
 
04:48:43.628 --> 04:48:43.638 align:start position:0%
more experience and knowledge than me on
 
04:48:46.150 --> 04:48:46.160 align:start position:0%
the bu default budgeting system and I
 
04:48:47.350 --> 04:48:47.360 align:start position:0%
would take any questions but I would
 
04:48:50.430 --> 04:48:50.440 align:start position:0%
defer to them if there's anything
 
04:48:52.628 --> 04:48:52.638 align:start position:0%
specific thank you representative dun
 
04:48:56.430 --> 04:48:56.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:58.670 --> 04:48:58.680 align:start position:0%
representative representative majori is
 
04:49:01.110 --> 04:49:01.120 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question thank you
 
04:49:02.708 --> 04:49:02.718 align:start position:0%
madam chairwoman and thank you for
 
04:49:07.150 --> 04:49:07.160 align:start position:0%
taking my question um the uh police and
 
04:49:10.350 --> 04:49:10.360 align:start position:0%
fire in my town are both um created by
 
04:49:12.390 --> 04:49:12.400 align:start position:0%
Statute statute the number of positions
 
04:49:15.548 --> 04:49:15.558 align:start position:0%
is created by Statute um like many other
 
04:49:18.350 --> 04:49:18.360 align:start position:0%
towns it's hard to fill those positions
 
04:49:20.430 --> 04:49:20.440 align:start position:0%
with this bill contemplate that the
 
04:49:23.110 --> 04:49:23.120 align:start position:0%
unfilled positions that we created by
 
04:49:26.150 --> 04:49:26.160 align:start position:0%
Statute then we could not default those
 
04:49:28.310 --> 04:49:28.320 align:start position:0%
salaries for those
 
04:49:30.750 --> 04:49:30.760 align:start position:0%
positions thank you for the
 
04:49:35.350 --> 04:49:35.360 align:start position:0%
question that is my understanding yes
 
04:49:39.230 --> 04:49:39.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:43.830 --> 04:49:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:49.628 --> 04:49:49.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:51.948 --> 04:49:51.958 align:start position:0%
Farrell good afternoon and welcome to
 
04:49:54.230 --> 04:49:54.240 align:start position:0%
Municipal and County government thank
 
04:49:56.868 --> 04:49:56.878 align:start position:0%
you madam chairwoman I appreciate it my
 
04:50:00.110 --> 04:50:00.120 align:start position:0%
name is John Ferrell I am a 15-year town
 
04:50:01.910 --> 04:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
councelor from the town of londondary
 
04:50:03.910 --> 04:50:03.920 align:start position:0%
and has sat as 10 years as the chairman
 
04:50:06.788 --> 04:50:06.798 align:start position:0%
of the Town Council um to help me a
 
04:50:08.510 --> 04:50:08.520 align:start position:0%
little bit with how I'm going to
 
04:50:10.830 --> 04:50:10.840 align:start position:0%
structure my testimony would it be okay
 
04:50:13.390 --> 04:50:13.400 align:start position:0%
if I asked the committee a
 
04:50:15.990 --> 04:50:16.000 align:start position:0%
question no you could you could ask a
 
04:50:17.948 --> 04:50:17.958 align:start position:0%
hypothetical question just to State it
 
04:50:22.230 --> 04:50:22.240 align:start position:0%
but we can't answer that so I me thank
 
04:50:25.110 --> 04:50:25.120 align:start position:0%
you so there is one member
 
04:50:27.910 --> 04:50:27.920 align:start position:0%
representative Dolan sat on the council
 
04:50:29.030 --> 04:50:29.040 align:start position:0%
with me for a number of years and
 
04:50:30.470 --> 04:50:30.480 align:start position:0%
everything so I know he's very familiar
 
04:50:32.788 --> 04:50:32.798 align:start position:0%
with developing default budgets what I'm
 
04:50:34.868 --> 04:50:34.878 align:start position:0%
looking for is so that I can structure
 
04:50:37.670 --> 04:50:37.680 align:start position:0%
my um presentation correctly is is our
 
04:50:39.510 --> 04:50:39.520 align:start position:0%
number are there many other
 
04:50:40.990 --> 04:50:41.000 align:start position:0%
Representatives who have actually
 
04:50:43.230 --> 04:50:43.240 align:start position:0%
developed default budgets and I know you
 
04:50:44.868 --> 04:50:44.878 align:start position:0%
don't want to answer me but I just want
 
04:50:47.708 --> 04:50:47.718 align:start position:0%
to be able to set that as a premise um
 
04:50:49.470 --> 04:50:49.480 align:start position:0%
Mr frell I would recommend that you
 
04:50:51.830 --> 04:50:51.840 align:start position:0%
assume that that the answer is no I
 
04:50:53.230 --> 04:50:53.240 align:start position:0%
appreciate that thank
 
04:50:56.070 --> 04:50:56.080 align:start position:0%
you so ladies and gentlemen over a
 
04:50:58.110 --> 04:50:58.120 align:start position:0%
period of years when we changed over to
 
04:51:00.470 --> 04:51:00.480 align:start position:0%
a default budget what we have found is
 
04:51:03.070 --> 04:51:03.080 align:start position:0%
is that the original writers of this I
 
04:51:04.708 --> 04:51:04.718 align:start position:0%
believe looked at it and said that this
 
04:51:06.110 --> 04:51:06.120 align:start position:0%
is a great idea and that it should be
 
04:51:08.150 --> 04:51:08.160 align:start position:0%
some sort of a tax cap and that this
 
04:51:10.990 --> 04:51:11.000 align:start position:0%
will control spending which which
 
04:51:13.628 --> 04:51:13.638 align:start position:0%
happened is it's exactly the opposite so
 
04:51:15.470 --> 04:51:15.480 align:start position:0%
what's happened is is that what we see
 
04:51:17.110 --> 04:51:17.120 align:start position:0%
is that things that have become
 
04:51:18.948 --> 04:51:18.958 align:start position:0%
Antiquated as far as spending let's
 
04:51:20.670 --> 04:51:20.680 align:start position:0%
think about things like postage
 
04:51:23.070 --> 04:51:23.080 align:start position:0%
telephone different things stationary
 
04:51:25.150 --> 04:51:25.160 align:start position:0%
all these items stay the same over years
 
04:51:27.150 --> 04:51:27.160 align:start position:0%
and years and years because the people
 
04:51:28.830 --> 04:51:28.840 align:start position:0%
who are putting these default budgets
 
04:51:30.548 --> 04:51:30.558 align:start position:0%
together are saying okay we're going to
 
04:51:32.590 --> 04:51:32.600 align:start position:0%
continue carrying the same costs over
 
04:51:35.030 --> 04:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
and over and over again so that we meet
 
04:51:37.948 --> 04:51:37.958 align:start position:0%
the default line what's happening is is
 
04:51:39.910 --> 04:51:39.920 align:start position:0%
that those items are all now what we
 
04:51:41.510 --> 04:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
would say you know out of out of whack
 
04:51:43.948 --> 04:51:43.958 align:start position:0%
or not in line so what's happening
 
04:51:45.628 --> 04:51:45.638 align:start position:0%
throughout the budgets here in London
 
04:51:46.750 --> 04:51:46.760 align:start position:0%
there and what we're seeing when we talk
 
04:51:49.350 --> 04:51:49.360 align:start position:0%
to other people around the state is is
 
04:51:51.470 --> 04:51:51.480 align:start position:0%
that we're leaving ourselves short from
 
04:51:53.390 --> 04:51:53.400 align:start position:0%
the standpoint of having 68 sworn
 
04:51:55.548 --> 04:51:55.558 align:start position:0%
officers we're only hiring 63 so we can
 
04:51:57.470 --> 04:51:57.480 align:start position:0%
use that money to meet our bottom line
 
04:51:59.750 --> 04:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
budget um what we're seeing is is that
 
04:52:01.990 --> 04:52:02.000 align:start position:0%
as the medical costs have risen from
 
04:52:05.590 --> 04:52:05.600 align:start position:0%
$23,000 for a family plan in 2010 to
 
04:52:08.470 --> 04:52:08.480 align:start position:0%
$444,000 for a family plan today is
 
04:52:10.070 --> 04:52:10.080 align:start position:0%
we're seeing that we're moving money
 
04:52:12.548 --> 04:52:12.558 align:start position:0%
around for the wrong reasons what we're
 
04:52:14.110 --> 04:52:14.120 align:start position:0%
looking to do is accomplish what I would
 
04:52:17.110 --> 04:52:17.120 align:start position:0%
call S sp3 there really needs to be a
 
04:52:18.910 --> 04:52:18.920 align:start position:0%
better form of budgeting there really
 
04:52:21.430 --> 04:52:21.440 align:start position:0%
needs to be an entire overhaul in legis
 
04:52:23.548 --> 04:52:23.558 align:start position:0%
of the legislation the legislation
 
04:52:26.590 --> 04:52:26.600 align:start position:0%
intent was a good one but it has failed
 
04:52:29.350 --> 04:52:29.360 align:start position:0%
now over time so what we're looking for
 
04:52:31.230 --> 04:52:31.240 align:start position:0%
is that take that first initial step
 
04:52:33.190 --> 04:52:33.200 align:start position:0%
here with you take that first step to
 
04:52:34.910 --> 04:52:34.920 align:start position:0%
start saying let's start peeling back
 
04:52:36.590 --> 04:52:36.600 align:start position:0%
you know the onion and saying what
 
04:52:38.990 --> 04:52:39.000 align:start position:0%
pieces can we look at first since there
 
04:52:40.708 --> 04:52:40.718 align:start position:0%
has not been an appetite for ter in
 
04:52:43.548 --> 04:52:43.558 align:start position:0%
apart the entire bill so what we would
 
04:52:45.310 --> 04:52:45.320 align:start position:0%
like to see from the standpoint of those
 
04:52:47.628 --> 04:52:47.638 align:start position:0%
of us who support this is is let's get a
 
04:52:49.708 --> 04:52:49.718 align:start position:0%
lot smarter about our money what's
 
04:52:51.310 --> 04:52:51.320 align:start position:0%
happening across the state is is that
 
04:52:53.470 --> 04:52:53.480 align:start position:0%
we're hearing costs are exponentially
 
04:52:56.190 --> 04:52:56.200 align:start position:0%
going up everywhere what used to cost us
 
04:52:59.110 --> 04:52:59.120 align:start position:0%
you know for a police officer at $60,000
 
04:52:59.990 --> 04:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
is now
 
04:53:02.830 --> 04:53:02.840 align:start position:0%
$150,000 for a police officer what we
 
04:53:04.990 --> 04:53:05.000 align:start position:0%
need as an aging state is is we need to
 
04:53:07.190 --> 04:53:07.200 align:start position:0%
be able to bring on more fire Personnel
 
04:53:09.270 --> 04:53:09.280 align:start position:0%
more medical personnel so that we can
 
04:53:11.350 --> 04:53:11.360 align:start position:0%
take care of the people who in our state
 
04:53:13.910 --> 04:53:13.920 align:start position:0%
and see to it that they are cared for in
 
04:53:16.750 --> 04:53:16.760 align:start position:0%
the right way yet we can't hire fast
 
04:53:18.868 --> 04:53:18.878 align:start position:0%
enough to be able to meet those needs
 
04:53:21.230 --> 04:53:21.240 align:start position:0%
because we're strung by these default
 
04:53:23.390 --> 04:53:23.400 align:start position:0%
budgets the voters of course determine
 
04:53:25.230 --> 04:53:25.240 align:start position:0%
whether we'll go over default or not we
 
04:53:26.868 --> 04:53:26.878 align:start position:0%
can certainly present budgets that go
 
04:53:29.548 --> 04:53:29.558 align:start position:0%
over default what we what personally
 
04:53:31.230 --> 04:53:31.240 align:start position:0%
what i' really like to see is go back to
 
04:53:33.830 --> 04:53:33.840 align:start position:0%
running this more like a business versus
 
04:53:36.708 --> 04:53:36.718 align:start position:0%
working inside you know legislation that
 
04:53:39.110 --> 04:53:39.120 align:start position:0%
is just Antiquated at this point I
 
04:53:41.270 --> 04:53:41.280 align:start position:0%
something that was approved in 199 96 I
 
04:53:42.990 --> 04:53:43.000 align:start position:0%
mean here we are folks 30 some odd years
 
04:53:45.708 --> 04:53:45.718 align:start position:0%
later it's time to start updating this
 
04:53:47.670 --> 04:53:47.680 align:start position:0%
start start bringing it up to what the
 
04:53:50.230 --> 04:53:50.240 align:start position:0%
standards of today versus you know what
 
04:53:51.750 --> 04:53:51.760 align:start position:0%
we saw in
 
04:53:53.750 --> 04:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
1996 I thank
 
04:53:56.430 --> 04:53:56.440 align:start position:0%

you all know sets the tax rate we don't
 
04:54:29.430 --> 04:54:29.440 align:start position:0%
know what the tax rate is going to be
 
04:54:31.230 --> 04:54:31.240 align:start position:0%
until we submit our budgets to the
 
04:54:32.590 --> 04:54:32.600 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue and we submit all
 
04:54:34.150 --> 04:54:34.160 align:start position:0%

have a rate for the for the um for the
 
04:54:45.230 --> 04:54:45.240 align:start position:0%
actual homeowners or for the commercial
 
04:54:47.628 --> 04:54:47.638 align:start position:0%
properties is unknown to us until we
 
04:54:49.150 --> 04:54:49.160 align:start position:0%
until we do that piece was that what
 
04:54:51.910 --> 04:54:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:54.708 --> 04:54:54.718 align:start position:0%
for further questions representative
 
04:54:56.910 --> 04:54:56.920 align:start position:0%
majori is recognized for a question
 
04:54:58.230 --> 04:54:58.240 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairwoman and thank you
 
04:55:00.670 --> 04:55:00.680 align:start position:0%
counselor for taking the question
 
04:55:03.548 --> 04:55:03.558 align:start position:0%
um so similar to what I what I posed to
 
04:55:06.830 --> 04:55:06.840 align:start position:0%
the sponsor uh the number of employees
 
04:55:08.390 --> 04:55:08.400 align:start position:0%
for our fire and police department is
 
04:55:09.990 --> 04:55:10.000 align:start position:0%
set by the ordinance that we created in
 
04:55:13.230 --> 04:55:13.240 align:start position:0%
the town so we try to to fill that and I
 
04:55:16.628 --> 04:55:16.638 align:start position:0%
heard you say that in your town your
 
04:55:18.788 --> 04:55:18.798 align:start position:0%
lary is a town or a city it's a town
 
04:55:21.868 --> 04:55:21.878 align:start position:0%
town thank you um you have
 
04:55:25.070 --> 04:55:25.080 align:start position:0%
68 sworn police off 68 sworn but but
 
04:55:27.868 --> 04:55:27.878 align:start position:0%
you're only able to staff 63 at this
 
04:55:30.270 --> 04:55:30.280 align:start position:0%
point we're only Staffing 63 it's not
 
04:55:31.868 --> 04:55:31.878 align:start position:0%
that we're not getting applicants we're
 
04:55:33.990 --> 04:55:34.000 align:start position:0%
actually lucky we're getting applicants
 
04:55:35.990 --> 04:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
and we're trying to get to 68 but what's
 
04:55:38.030 --> 04:55:38.040 align:start position:0%
happening is is that we're running out
 
04:55:41.670 --> 04:55:41.680 align:start position:0%
of money so um and we're because we're a
 
04:55:43.430 --> 04:55:43.440 align:start position:0%
bottom line budget what's happening is
 
04:55:45.110 --> 04:55:45.120 align:start position:0%
that money is being used for other
 
04:55:47.150 --> 04:55:47.160 align:start position:0%
things that the police department needs
 
04:55:49.350 --> 04:55:49.360 align:start position:0%
such as whether it be weapons ammunition
 
04:55:52.030 --> 04:55:52.040 align:start position:0%
training training is a big issue around
 
04:55:54.628 --> 04:55:54.638 align:start position:0%
all of the Departments you set a default
 
04:55:58.030 --> 04:55:58.040 align:start position:0%
Budget on training and it never goes
 
04:56:00.788 --> 04:56:00.798 align:start position:0%
up that's because it's it's just a piece
 
04:56:04.190 --> 04:56:04.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:06.708 --> 04:56:06.718 align:start position:0%

04:56:41.948 --> 04:56:41.958 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:56:45.830 --> 04:56:45.840 align:start position:0%
474 um in anticipation I I pulled up um
 
04:56:50.030 --> 04:56:50.040 align:start position:0%
a website called ed jobs nh.com it's a
 
04:56:51.990 --> 04:56:52.000 align:start position:0%
listing of positions open within a
 
04:56:55.030 --> 04:56:55.040 align:start position:0%
school district they're over over 900
 
04:56:57.110 --> 04:56:57.120 align:start position:0%
positions currently open in school
 
04:56:58.830 --> 04:56:58.840 align:start position:0%
districts right now school districts
 
04:57:02.310 --> 04:57:02.320 align:start position:0%
have staff turnover all the time PA
 
04:57:05.270 --> 04:57:05.280 align:start position:0%
professionals School nurses bus drivers
 
04:57:08.270 --> 04:57:08.280 align:start position:0%
teachers I could Le read some of the the
 
04:57:11.230 --> 04:57:11.240 align:start position:0%
the job listings but to limit the
 
04:57:13.390 --> 04:57:13.400 align:start position:0%
default budget to not include these
 
04:57:14.708 --> 04:57:14.718 align:start position:0%
positions when school districts have
 
04:57:17.310 --> 04:57:17.320 align:start position:0%
staff turn over all the time would be
 
04:57:19.830 --> 04:57:19.840 align:start position:0%
would be impracticable the other aspect
 
04:57:21.750 --> 04:57:21.760 align:start position:0%
that I'm not certain
 
04:57:25.830 --> 04:57:25.840 align:start position:0%
um with the bill it says um position
 
04:57:28.190 --> 04:57:28.200 align:start position:0%
line8 position turnover which occur
 
04:57:29.830 --> 04:57:29.840 align:start position:0%
before the public hearing for the
 
04:57:32.430 --> 04:57:32.440 align:start position:0%
proposed budget what is the start date
 
04:57:34.708 --> 04:57:34.718 align:start position:0%
is the start date July 1 of the new
 
04:57:36.670 --> 04:57:36.680 align:start position:0%
fiscal year for the school board I don't
 
04:57:38.070 --> 04:57:38.080 align:start position:0%
or for the school district I don't think
 
04:57:40.788 --> 04:57:40.798 align:start position:0%
that's necessarily clear um and I guess
 
04:57:43.070 --> 04:57:43.080 align:start position:0%
my other question is what if the
 
04:57:45.910 --> 04:57:45.920 align:start position:0%
position becomes vacant in the prior
 
04:57:49.470 --> 04:57:49.480 align:start position:0%
fiscal year but yet is not the new hire
 
04:57:51.590 --> 04:57:51.600 align:start position:0%
is not made until the new fiscal year so
 
04:57:54.070 --> 04:57:54.080 align:start position:0%
for example somebody hands in their
 
04:57:57.470 --> 04:57:57.480 align:start position:0%
letter of resignation effective June 1st
 
04:57:59.788 --> 04:57:59.798 align:start position:0%
of Any Given school year and then they
 
04:58:01.708 --> 04:58:01.718 align:start position:0%
don't get a chance to hire that person
 
04:58:05.310 --> 04:58:05.320 align:start position:0%
until perhaps August um you know how
 
04:58:07.948 --> 04:58:07.958 align:start position:0%
does that factor into into your default
 
04:58:09.830 --> 04:58:09.840 align:start position:0%
budget they planning on filling the
 
04:58:13.510 --> 04:58:13.520 align:start position:0%
position but it takes time to send send
 
04:58:15.190 --> 04:58:15.200 align:start position:0%
out send out the advertisement get it
 
04:58:17.670 --> 04:58:17.680 align:start position:0%
posted do interviewing hire people so on
 
04:58:20.350 --> 04:58:20.360 align:start position:0%
and so forth so um again my simple
 
04:58:22.750 --> 04:58:22.760 align:start position:0%
testimony is that you you know position
 
04:58:24.548 --> 04:58:24.558 align:start position:0%
turnover which occurs before the public
 
04:58:27.110 --> 04:58:27.120 align:start position:0%
hearing for the proposed budget is is is
 
04:58:28.788 --> 04:58:28.798 align:start position:0%
not workable for school districts we
 
04:58:30.750 --> 04:58:30.760 align:start position:0%
have people coming coming and going in
 
04:58:32.430 --> 04:58:32.440 align:start position:0%
school districts all the time teachers
 
04:58:34.628 --> 04:58:34.638 align:start position:0%
PA professionals bus drivers School
 
04:58:37.350 --> 04:58:37.360 align:start position:0%
nurses I could go on and on but I I
 
04:58:39.548 --> 04:58:39.558 align:start position:0%
won't so with that I'm happy to happy to
 
04:58:40.548 --> 04:58:40.558 align:start position:0%

Municipal and County government good
 
04:59:27.400 --> 04:59:31.230 align:start position:0%
Municipal and County government good

04:59:31.230 --> 04:59:31.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:34.390 --> 04:59:34.400 align:start position:0%
um there we go all right good afternoon
 
04:59:37.030 --> 04:59:37.040 align:start position:0%
um I'm also a town counselor in London
 
04:59:40.788 --> 04:59:40.798 align:start position:0%
der as councelor fa frell well outlined
 
04:59:43.948 --> 04:59:43.958 align:start position:0%
sb2 has its issues I'm happy to see that
 
04:59:46.628 --> 04:59:46.638 align:start position:0%
this committee saw many reforms on
 
04:59:48.590 --> 04:59:48.600 align:start position:0%
municipal government throughout today um
 
04:59:49.910 --> 04:59:49.920 align:start position:0%
reading through the bills there was a
 
04:59:52.590 --> 04:59:52.600 align:start position:0%
lot of great bills that came through um
 
04:59:54.190 --> 04:59:54.200 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to go and repeat some of
 
04:59:56.230 --> 04:59:56.240 align:start position:0%
the same things that he said but when it
 
04:59:58.030 --> 04:59:58.040 align:start position:0%
comes down to it in the opposition to
 
04:59:59.670 --> 04:59:59.680 align:start position:0%
this we have to go to what is the
 
05:00:03.070 --> 05:00:03.080 align:start position:0%
definition of default so yes we can have
 
05:00:05.270 --> 05:00:05.280 align:start position:0%
extenuating circumstances where someone
 
05:00:06.910 --> 05:00:06.920 align:start position:0%
resigns right before the end of the year
 
05:00:10.110 --> 05:00:10.120 align:start position:0%
or other things but we really are trying
 
05:00:12.110 --> 05:00:12.120 align:start position:0%
get something where we are proposing a
 
05:00:14.270 --> 05:00:14.280 align:start position:0%
true default sometimes going through the
 
05:00:16.948 --> 05:00:16.958 align:start position:0%
budget process some of our constituents
 
05:00:19.310 --> 05:00:19.320 align:start position:0%
are pretty angry with what goes into a
 
05:00:21.430 --> 05:00:21.440 align:start position:0%
default budget because they feel it's
 
05:00:23.750 --> 05:00:23.760 align:start position:0%
feel it's not a true default budget it's
 
05:00:26.670 --> 05:00:26.680 align:start position:0%
not what it's meant to be so when we
 
05:00:28.548 --> 05:00:28.558 align:start position:0%
look at this I would like to get it down
 
05:00:30.990 --> 05:00:31.000 align:start position:0%
to what something is when we have open
 
05:00:33.470 --> 05:00:33.480 align:start position:0%
positions and we hear frequently in
 
05:00:35.990 --> 05:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
meetings how many open positions we have
 
05:00:38.390 --> 05:00:38.400 align:start position:0%
how come they're still counted and this
 
05:00:39.628 --> 05:00:39.638 align:start position:0%
would be something that would help us
 
05:00:42.270 --> 05:00:42.280 align:start position:0%
address so we are being up and up and on
 
05:00:45.030 --> 05:00:45.040 align:start position:0%
the honest and as a Dylan rule state we
 
05:00:46.708 --> 05:00:46.718 align:start position:0%
can't do that ourselves we have to come
 
05:00:49.030 --> 05:00:49.040 align:start position:0%
here and ask for help and um that's why
 
05:00:51.190 --> 05:00:51.200 align:start position:0%
I'm here today to help speak up and get
 
05:00:52.590 --> 05:00:52.600 align:start position:0%
something so we can provide better
 
05:00:55.830 --> 05:00:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:58.708 --> 05:00:58.718 align:start position:0%
da are you open to taking questions
 
05:01:01.510 --> 05:01:01.520 align:start position:0%
questions for Mr
 
05:01:04.190 --> 05:01:04.200 align:start position:0%
Faber representative majority has a
 
05:01:05.990 --> 05:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
question do you just automatically look
 
05:01:07.350 --> 05:01:07.360 align:start position:0%
right at me I
 
05:01:09.430 --> 05:01:09.440 align:start position:0%
guess thank you madam chairwoman thank
 
05:01:11.270 --> 05:01:11.280 align:start position:0%
you for taking my my question and I'm
 
05:01:12.830 --> 05:01:12.840 align:start position:0%
sorry to keep harping on this I just
 
05:01:14.670 --> 05:01:14.680 align:start position:0%
want to be clear that I understand the
 
05:01:17.270 --> 05:01:17.280 align:start position:0%
perspective um and I'll use your town if
 
05:01:20.990 --> 05:01:21.000 align:start position:0%
you have 63 positions uh 63 sworn
 
05:01:24.030 --> 05:01:24.040 align:start position:0%
available but only 60 68 sworn available
 
05:01:26.868 --> 05:01:26.878 align:start position:0%
but 63 filled are you suggesting that
 
05:01:29.070 --> 05:01:29.080 align:start position:0%
you would not default the salaries of
 
05:01:31.510 --> 05:01:31.520 align:start position:0%
the five open
 
05:01:35.150 --> 05:01:35.160 align:start position:0%
positions so it would be something where
 
05:01:37.110 --> 05:01:37.120 align:start position:0%
I think we need to be able to clearly
 
05:01:40.750 --> 05:01:40.760 align:start position:0%
State how that works so I I think the
 
05:01:42.868 --> 05:01:42.878 align:start position:0%
Simplicity of this bill would not do
 
05:01:45.948 --> 05:01:45.958 align:start position:0%
that and I'm happy that it will be
 
05:01:47.590 --> 05:01:47.600 align:start position:0%
something that's a little more
 
05:01:50.390 --> 05:01:50.400 align:start position:0%
clearcut and we could have went through
 
05:01:52.628 --> 05:01:52.638 align:start position:0%
multiple changes to reform default has
 
05:01:54.590 --> 05:01:54.600 align:start position:0%
countless issues this is where something
 
05:01:55.868 --> 05:01:55.878 align:start position:0%
where we're trying to take the first
 
05:01:57.110 --> 05:01:57.120 align:start position:0%
step down that road to getting this
 
05:01:59.590 --> 05:01:59.600 align:start position:0%
fixed it's a very complicated
 
05:02:03.670 --> 05:02:03.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:07.430 --> 05:02:07.440 align:start position:0%
questions no seeing none thank
 
05:02:10.030 --> 05:02:10.040 align:start position:0%
you and the last pink card that I have
 
05:02:17.868 --> 05:02:17.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:20.430 --> 05:02:20.440 align:start position:0%
power good afternoon and welcome to
 
05:02:24.110 --> 05:02:24.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:26.190 --> 05:02:26.200 align:start position:0%
government thank you Madame chair and
 
05:02:27.548 --> 05:02:27.558 align:start position:0%
members of the municipal and County
 
05:02:29.230 --> 05:02:29.240 align:start position:0%
government committee for the record I'm
 
05:02:31.830 --> 05:02:31.840 align:start position:0%
Eric power from Brookline representing
 
05:02:33.628 --> 05:02:33.638 align:start position:0%
myself in favor of this
 
05:02:38.590 --> 05:02:38.600 align:start position:0%
bill and um in our in our town we have
 
05:02:41.230 --> 05:02:41.240 align:start position:0%
two school districts one of them is SP2
 
05:02:44.470 --> 05:02:44.480 align:start position:0%
and I have spent a lot of uh done a lot
 
05:02:46.510 --> 05:02:46.520 align:start position:0%
of research on default budgets and
 
05:02:48.230 --> 05:02:48.240 align:start position:0%
looked at default budgets found mistakes
 
05:02:49.548 --> 05:02:49.558 align:start position:0%
in default budgets that the school
 
05:02:52.150 --> 05:02:52.160 align:start position:0%
district even uh agreed with me on
 
05:02:55.628 --> 05:02:55.638 align:start position:0%
before it actually went to the ballot um
 
05:02:57.990 --> 05:02:58.000 align:start position:0%
and there are some definite things that
 
05:02:59.470 --> 05:02:59.480 align:start position:0%
need to be fixed and I thank you
 
05:03:01.350 --> 05:03:01.360 align:start position:0%
representative Dunn for bringing this
 
05:03:03.788 --> 05:03:03.798 align:start position:0%
forward uh I'm going to speak to the
 
05:03:06.070 --> 05:03:06.080 align:start position:0%
amendment he he he handed out which is
 
05:03:06.080 --> 05:03:06.788 align:start position:0%
amendment he he he handed out which is
uh

05:03:06.788 --> 05:03:06.798 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:03:10.350 --> 05:03:10.360 align:start position:0%
2025 d0 600h
 
05:03:13.910 --> 05:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
and um first thing it does I think
 
05:03:15.708 --> 05:03:15.718 align:start position:0%
that's important is that there's a
 
05:03:17.070 --> 05:03:17.080 align:start position:0%
couple places where there's a missing
 
05:03:20.548 --> 05:03:20.558 align:start position:0%
reference to RSA 40 colon
 
05:03:23.670 --> 05:03:23.680 align:start position:0%
14-b that's the RSA that allows the
 
05:03:26.470 --> 05:03:26.480 align:start position:0%
budget committee to get the uh to have
 
05:03:28.548 --> 05:03:28.558 align:start position:0%
the authority to determine the default
 
05:03:31.230 --> 05:03:31.240 align:start position:0%
budget um and so that was missing in a
 
05:03:33.708 --> 05:03:33.718 align:start position:0%
couple of places and that's been added
 
05:03:36.788 --> 05:03:36.798 align:start position:0%
in um I'd also like to mention the first
 
05:03:38.990 --> 05:03:39.000 align:start position:0%
change that's on line eight of the
 
05:03:40.910 --> 05:03:40.920 align:start position:0%
amendment where it says other
 
05:03:43.750 --> 05:03:43.760 align:start position:0%
obligations previously incurred by law
 
05:03:46.430 --> 05:03:46.440 align:start position:0%
or mandated by law and there's been some
 
05:03:49.230 --> 05:03:49.240 align:start position:0%
situations where um people said
 
05:03:50.788 --> 05:03:50.798 align:start position:0%
obligations have been previously
 
05:03:52.948 --> 05:03:52.958 align:start position:0%
incurred and they didn't think the by
 
05:03:54.788 --> 05:03:54.798 align:start position:0%
law applied to that because it says
 
05:03:57.270 --> 05:03:57.280 align:start position:0%
mandated by law so this just adds it in
 
05:03:59.350 --> 05:03:59.360 align:start position:0%
both places so it's really making sure
 
05:04:01.830 --> 05:04:01.840 align:start position:0%
that the obligation is incurred by law
 
05:04:05.150 --> 05:04:05.160 align:start position:0%
and not really by preference um so that
 
05:04:08.230 --> 05:04:08.240 align:start position:0%
that's that's an important update um on
 
05:04:10.708 --> 05:04:10.718 align:start position:0%
line nine of the amend been it talks
 
05:04:14.150 --> 05:04:14.160 align:start position:0%
about um taking out salaries and
 
05:04:15.350 --> 05:04:15.360 align:start position:0%
benefits positions that have been
 
05:04:17.070 --> 05:04:17.080 align:start position:0%
eliminated in the proposed
 
05:04:19.548 --> 05:04:19.558 align:start position:0%
budget um so obviously if the position's
 
05:04:20.948 --> 05:04:20.958 align:start position:0%
been eliminated should be not in the
 
05:04:23.390 --> 05:04:23.400 align:start position:0%
default budget the next starting at the
 
05:04:25.910 --> 05:04:25.920 align:start position:0%
end of line nine and 10 it says by
 
05:04:27.910 --> 05:04:27.920 align:start position:0%
salaries and benefits of positions that
 
05:04:29.948 --> 05:04:29.958 align:start position:0%
were vacant before the previous year's
 
05:04:32.670 --> 05:04:32.680 align:start position:0%
budget was approved and have remained
 
05:04:36.230 --> 05:04:36.240 align:start position:0%
vacant so this addresses the the
 
05:04:38.470 --> 05:04:38.480 align:start position:0%
positions that that are open and stay
 
05:04:42.270 --> 05:04:42.280 align:start position:0%
open in depth itely and the money in
 
05:04:45.750 --> 05:04:45.760 align:start position:0%
that is often used for other purposes
 
05:04:48.670 --> 05:04:48.680 align:start position:0%
but it does allow for a year when it's
 
05:04:50.670 --> 05:04:50.680 align:start position:0%
positions open for the first year that
 
05:04:52.310 --> 05:04:52.320 align:start position:0%
it is allowed to be part of the default
 
05:04:54.110 --> 05:04:54.120 align:start position:0%
budget but if it stays unfilled for more
 
05:04:57.190 --> 05:04:57.200 align:start position:0%
than a year it goes out of the default
 
05:05:00.868 --> 05:05:00.878 align:start position:0%
budget um and then on line 11 in the
 
05:05:02.910 --> 05:05:02.920 align:start position:0%
middle reflecting the actual salary and
 
05:05:04.590 --> 05:05:04.600 align:start position:0%
benefits of the fill positions as of the
 
05:05:07.310 --> 05:05:07.320 align:start position:0%
public hearing of the proposed budget
 
05:05:08.788 --> 05:05:08.798 align:start position:0%
that's important that was in the
 
05:05:12.390 --> 05:05:12.400 align:start position:0%
original bill that means for example um
 
05:05:14.910 --> 05:05:14.920 align:start position:0%
we had a librarian a senior librarian
 
05:05:17.150 --> 05:05:17.160 align:start position:0%
that was making about $100,000 with pay
 
05:05:18.590 --> 05:05:18.600 align:start position:0%
and benefits
 
05:05:22.150 --> 05:05:22.160 align:start position:0%
retire and they hired a a younger person
 
05:05:24.110 --> 05:05:24.120 align:start position:0%
that was getting paid with salary and
 
05:05:25.910 --> 05:05:25.920 align:start position:0%
benefits about
 
05:05:28.310 --> 05:05:28.320 align:start position:0%
$65,000 but by the way the law was
 
05:05:30.750 --> 05:05:30.760 align:start position:0%
written that person was already on board
 
05:05:34.628 --> 05:05:34.638 align:start position:0%
already working and that that that we
 
05:05:36.390 --> 05:05:36.400 align:start position:0%
could not change the default budget to
 
05:05:38.708 --> 05:05:38.718 align:start position:0%
$65,000 because of the way the law is
 
05:05:40.990 --> 05:05:41.000 align:start position:0%
right now we had to keep the $100,000 so
 
05:05:42.750 --> 05:05:42.760 align:start position:0%
there's already overpaying for something
 
05:05:44.990 --> 05:05:45.000 align:start position:0%
we already know the we already know the
 
05:05:47.150 --> 05:05:47.160 align:start position:0%
new person that's what this bill takes
 
05:05:50.430 --> 05:05:50.440 align:start position:0%
care of and
 
05:05:55.110 --> 05:05:55.120 align:start position:0%
um and then down on line 17 to 19 any
 
05:05:57.230 --> 05:05:57.240 align:start position:0%
budget item in the operating budget
 
05:05:59.310 --> 05:05:59.320 align:start position:0%
authorized for the previous year and
 
05:06:01.868 --> 05:06:01.878 align:start position:0%
there and there was a transfer made for
 
05:06:03.910 --> 05:06:03.920 align:start position:0%
a one-time expenditure you'll reduce
 
05:06:05.948 --> 05:06:05.958 align:start position:0%
that line item by that transfer that
 
05:06:09.070 --> 05:06:09.080 align:start position:0%
means um if you're taking a line item
 
05:06:11.590 --> 05:06:11.600 align:start position:0%
that was and you start using it for
 
05:06:14.750 --> 05:06:14.760 align:start position:0%
onetime expenses then that line item
 
05:06:18.910 --> 05:06:18.920 align:start position:0%
will now be reduced so this closes sort
 
05:06:21.190 --> 05:06:21.200 align:start position:0%
of there's I call it the uh there's a
 
05:06:23.470 --> 05:06:23.480 align:start position:0%
there's a way to pad the budget by
 
05:06:26.830 --> 05:06:26.840 align:start position:0%
having open staff vacancies that are in
 
05:06:28.470 --> 05:06:28.480 align:start position:0%
the default budget but never filling
 
05:06:30.430 --> 05:06:30.440 align:start position:0%
them or keeping them over for a long
 
05:06:32.788 --> 05:06:32.798 align:start position:0%
long time there's the what I call this
 
05:06:36.150 --> 05:06:36.160 align:start position:0%
line item harvesting transfer loophole
 
05:06:38.150 --> 05:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
where money is put in one light item and
 
05:06:40.948 --> 05:06:40.958 align:start position:0%
used for another for one onetime
 
05:06:44.030 --> 05:06:44.040 align:start position:0%
expenses and then there's obviously the
 
05:06:45.830 --> 05:06:45.840 align:start position:0%
other items I talked about in terms of
 
05:06:47.390 --> 05:06:47.400 align:start position:0%
fixing some references and putting in
 
05:06:51.548 --> 05:06:51.558 align:start position:0%
the by law um so if you have positions
 
05:06:52.948 --> 05:06:52.958 align:start position:0%
that are vacant and they're vacant for
 
05:06:54.628 --> 05:06:54.638 align:start position:0%
more than a year maybe with police or
 
05:06:57.150 --> 05:06:57.160 align:start position:0%
fire and it's hard to fill them there is
 
05:07:00.270 --> 05:07:00.280 align:start position:0%
a tool you don't pad the default budget
 
05:07:02.030 --> 05:07:02.040 align:start position:0%
the default budget should be the basic
 
05:07:04.110 --> 05:07:04.120 align:start position:0%
budget that you are passing it's the
 
05:07:06.548 --> 05:07:06.558 align:start position:0%
Bare Bones budget but there is a tool
 
05:07:09.310 --> 05:07:09.320 align:start position:0%
that's out there and we do use it in in
 
05:07:10.788 --> 05:07:10.798 align:start position:0%
our our school districts it's called a
 
05:07:13.470 --> 05:07:13.480 align:start position:0%
contingency fund contingency fund can is
 
05:07:18.270 --> 05:07:18.280 align:start position:0%
a separate warn article RSA 31 colon 98-
 
05:07:22.548 --> 05:07:22.558 align:start position:0%
a 31 colon 98- a that's a separate
 
05:07:24.390 --> 05:07:24.400 align:start position:0%
contingency fund that can be put and
 
05:07:25.910 --> 05:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
everybody knows when they're voting on
 
05:07:28.430 --> 05:07:28.440 align:start position:0%
it this is a contingency that we want to
 
05:07:30.590 --> 05:07:30.600 align:start position:0%
put $100,000 or
 
05:07:33.150 --> 05:07:33.160 align:start position:0%
$300,000 and maybe it's for things that
 
05:07:34.948 --> 05:07:34.958 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be in the default budget but we
 
05:07:37.548 --> 05:07:37.558 align:start position:0%
might want to fill some positions and it
 
05:07:39.510 --> 05:07:39.520 align:start position:0%
puts it transparently in front of the
 
05:07:41.670 --> 05:07:41.680 align:start position:0%
voters so there's a tool there instead
 
05:07:44.910 --> 05:07:44.920 align:start position:0%
of sort of padding the default budget
 
05:07:46.948 --> 05:07:46.958 align:start position:0%
you can use this contingency fund as a
 
05:07:49.948 --> 05:07:49.958 align:start position:0%
way to clearly state to voters that this
 
05:07:52.510 --> 05:07:52.520 align:start position:0%
is this is the purpose of it instead of
 
05:07:53.910 --> 05:07:53.920 align:start position:0%
you know hiding things in the default
 
05:07:55.948 --> 05:07:55.958 align:start position:0%
budget the default budget is you know
 
05:07:58.830 --> 05:07:58.840 align:start position:0%
I've talked to Dr myself they do not do
 
05:08:01.750 --> 05:08:01.760 align:start position:0%
much uh enforcement of default budgets
 
05:08:03.670 --> 05:08:03.680 align:start position:0%
they don't they don't really look at the
 
05:08:05.390 --> 05:08:05.400 align:start position:0%
default budgets unfortunately that's
 
05:08:07.948 --> 05:08:07.958 align:start position:0%
another issue but the number one
 
05:08:10.390 --> 05:08:10.400 align:start position:0%
question they get every meeting season
 
05:08:15.070 --> 05:08:15.080 align:start position:0%
around now is questions from you know
 
05:08:16.990 --> 05:08:17.000 align:start position:0%
Selectmen school boards budget
 
05:08:19.310 --> 05:08:19.320 align:start position:0%
committees citizens about default
 
05:08:23.310 --> 05:08:23.320 align:start position:0%
budgets and so um there's this this this
 
05:08:25.030 --> 05:08:25.040 align:start position:0%
I think would help that a lot because it
 
05:08:26.948 --> 05:08:26.958 align:start position:0%
would make it very clear of these
 
05:08:28.750 --> 05:08:28.760 align:start position:0%
loopholes and I think it would be very
 
05:08:30.708 --> 05:08:30.718 align:start position:0%
good for Citizens and then if you can
 
05:08:32.190 --> 05:08:32.200 align:start position:0%
use the contingency fund for those
 
05:08:34.070 --> 05:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
things you think you need to have for
 
05:08:36.030 --> 05:08:36.040 align:start position:0%
contingency that would make a lot of
 
05:08:39.470 --> 05:08:39.480 align:start position:0%
sense so for that reason I would
 
05:08:41.830 --> 05:08:41.840 align:start position:0%
recommend that the committee recommend
 
05:08:44.868 --> 05:08:44.878 align:start position:0%
this uh H this house bill
 
05:08:48.310 --> 05:08:48.320 align:start position:0%
475 ought to pass with Amendment and
 
05:08:50.390 --> 05:08:50.400 align:start position:0%
with that I'll close and take any
 
05:08:53.150 --> 05:08:53.160 align:start position:0%
questions thank you other questions for
 
05:08:53.160 --> 05:08:56.030 align:start position:0%
questions thank you other questions for
the

05:08:56.030 --> 05:08:56.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:58.948 --> 05:08:58.958 align:start position:0%
speaker representative Dolan thank you
 
05:09:01.830 --> 05:09:01.840 align:start position:0%
madam chair uh administrative question
 
05:09:04.430 --> 05:09:04.440 align:start position:0%
for for the speaker or
 
05:09:07.030 --> 05:09:07.040 align:start position:0%
for one of the prior
 
05:09:11.190 --> 05:09:11.200 align:start position:0%
speakers the effect of date of this is
 
05:09:14.910 --> 05:09:14.920 align:start position:0%
right now scheduled for January 1st 2026
 
05:09:17.548 --> 05:09:17.558 align:start position:0%
does that make a difference to the to
 
05:09:19.190 --> 05:09:19.200 align:start position:0%
what we should be doing is that the
 
05:09:21.548 --> 05:09:21.558 align:start position:0%
correct effective date uh to get the
 
05:09:23.990 --> 05:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
most bang for the buck for this
 
05:09:25.788 --> 05:09:25.798 align:start position:0%
change thank you for the question
 
05:09:29.430 --> 05:09:29.440 align:start position:0%
representative Dolan um I am not OS but
 
05:09:32.150 --> 05:09:32.160 align:start position:0%
I my understanding is that bills such as
 
05:09:34.628 --> 05:09:34.638 align:start position:0%
this would probably be in effect 60 days
 
05:09:38.110 --> 05:09:38.120 align:start position:0%
after passage because you do have
 
05:09:43.190 --> 05:09:43.200 align:start position:0%
some um political subdivisions that will
 
05:09:46.628 --> 05:09:46.638 align:start position:0%
uh start doing things much earlier um I
 
05:09:48.190 --> 05:09:48.200 align:start position:0%
don't think there's any s SP2 budget
 
05:09:50.070 --> 05:09:50.080 align:start position:0%
hearings before January 1st but they get
 
05:09:52.868 --> 05:09:52.878 align:start position:0%
pretty close to that date so yeah you
 
05:09:55.390 --> 05:09:55.400 align:start position:0%
might want to look at uh checking that
 
05:09:57.270 --> 05:09:57.280 align:start position:0%
effective date with OS to make sure it
 
05:09:59.030 --> 05:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
makes sense there might be a reason I'm
 
05:10:01.590 --> 05:10:01.600 align:start position:0%
not aware of that it needs to be that um
 
05:10:04.750 --> 05:10:04.760 align:start position:0%
but that's that's my input on that
 
05:10:07.390 --> 05:10:07.400 align:start position:0%
followup yes could I extend that
 
05:10:11.030 --> 05:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
question to the sponsor answer or any of
 
05:10:14.590 --> 05:10:14.600 align:start position:0%
the uh other speakers that are you okay
 
05:10:16.868 --> 05:10:16.878 align:start position:0%
with January 1st 2026 or do you think
 
05:10:20.070 --> 05:10:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:23.548 --> 05:10:23.558 align:start position:0%
changed representative Dolan I we hear
 
05:10:25.190 --> 05:10:25.200 align:start position:0%
that there's a question with regards to
 
05:10:28.788 --> 05:10:28.798 align:start position:0%
the effective date and um we the
 
05:10:32.590 --> 05:10:32.600 align:start position:0%
committee or or I can can look into that
 
05:10:34.430 --> 05:10:34.440 align:start position:0%
and get an answer to that CU I'm not
 
05:10:38.830 --> 05:10:38.840 align:start position:0%
sure that the prime sponsor has an
 
05:10:40.628 --> 05:10:40.638 align:start position:0%
answer to that do you have an answer to
 
05:10:43.110 --> 05:10:43.120 align:start position:0%
that okay I didn't think so so we can
 
05:10:44.750 --> 05:10:44.760 align:start position:0%
certainly look into that and get an
 
05:10:48.230 --> 05:10:48.240 align:start position:0%
answer okay further questions
 
05:10:48.240 --> 05:10:49.350 align:start position:0%
answer okay further questions
representative

05:10:49.350 --> 05:10:49.360 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:10:51.230 --> 05:10:51.240 align:start position:0%
majori thank you madam chair I want to
 
05:10:52.310 --> 05:10:52.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking another question
 
05:10:54.230 --> 05:10:54.240 align:start position:0%
for me in the situation where you raised
 
05:10:56.670 --> 05:10:56.680 align:start position:0%
where you had one salary at $100,000 and
 
05:10:58.708 --> 05:10:58.718 align:start position:0%
then you had it you had the new position
 
05:11:02.030 --> 05:11:02.040 align:start position:0%
at 65,000 or you know just using numbers
 
05:11:04.948 --> 05:11:04.958 align:start position:0%
uh do you agree that the Delta would
 
05:11:07.390 --> 05:11:07.400 align:start position:0%
fall to fund balance at the end of the
 
05:11:10.548 --> 05:11:10.558 align:start position:0%
year or or it doesn't mean that that
 
05:11:13.070 --> 05:11:13.080 align:start position:0%
$40,000 is padded but do we agree that
 
05:11:14.750 --> 05:11:14.760 align:start position:0%
that money would not would organically
 
05:11:17.110 --> 05:11:17.120 align:start position:0%
fall to fund balance thank you for the
 
05:11:19.270 --> 05:11:19.280 align:start position:0%
question represented majority yes if you
 
05:11:21.150 --> 05:11:21.160 align:start position:0%
have the money that's not expended it
 
05:11:24.430 --> 05:11:24.440 align:start position:0%
would go to the um the unexpended fund
 
05:11:26.510 --> 05:11:26.520 align:start position:0%
balance at the end of the year but
 
05:11:29.070 --> 05:11:29.080 align:start position:0%
there's nothing stopping the school
 
05:11:30.670 --> 05:11:30.680 align:start position:0%
board in this case with the school
 
05:11:33.030 --> 05:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
district um from taking that
 
05:11:36.030 --> 05:11:36.040 align:start position:0%
$35,000 and spending it on anything they
 
05:11:39.590 --> 05:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
want and you know sometimes they do and
 
05:11:41.510 --> 05:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
so the default budget is really supposed
 
05:11:43.310 --> 05:11:43.320 align:start position:0%
to be the Bare Bones budget with no
 
05:11:45.390 --> 05:11:45.400 align:start position:0%
extras and no padding and that's what
 
05:11:47.750 --> 05:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
this bill tries to do and like I said if
 
05:11:50.510 --> 05:11:50.520 align:start position:0%
you if you want to have a contingency
 
05:11:52.110 --> 05:11:52.120 align:start position:0%
fund the right way to do it is through
 
05:11:56.150 --> 05:11:56.160 align:start position:0%
RSA 3198 a that's the best way to do it
 
05:11:57.510 --> 05:11:57.520 align:start position:0%
then everybody knows that that's a
 
05:11:59.470 --> 05:11:59.480 align:start position:0%
contingency fund and if that's not spent
 
05:12:02.150 --> 05:12:02.160 align:start position:0%
that returns to the taxpayers as well
 
05:12:02.160 --> 05:12:02.868 align:start position:0%
that returns to the taxpayers as well
thank

05:12:02.868 --> 05:12:02.878 align:start position:0%
thank
 
05:12:05.430 --> 05:12:05.440 align:start position:0%
you representative grund is recognized
 
05:12:07.470 --> 05:12:07.480 align:start position:0%
for a question thank you madam chair and
 
05:12:10.788 --> 05:12:10.798 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um so I
 
05:12:12.390 --> 05:12:12.400 align:start position:0%
know we're talking a lot about headcount
 
05:12:15.470 --> 05:12:15.480 align:start position:0%
but if we're looking at overall defa
 
05:12:18.390 --> 05:12:18.400 align:start position:0%
default budget calculation excuse me
 
05:12:20.070 --> 05:12:20.080 align:start position:0%
should we consider including
 
05:12:21.990 --> 05:12:22.000 align:start position:0%
Transportation Utilities in default
 
05:12:24.190 --> 05:12:24.200 align:start position:0%
budgets because Transportation by law
 
05:12:26.548 --> 05:12:26.558 align:start position:0%
for k through eight is required and when
 
05:12:28.990 --> 05:12:29.000 align:start position:0%
you have a new contract in a year it's
 
05:12:30.830 --> 05:12:30.840 align:start position:0%
included in a budget but it's not the
 
05:12:33.310 --> 05:12:33.320 align:start position:0%
default budget because it's last year's
 
05:12:35.270 --> 05:12:35.280 align:start position:0%
cost and same with utilities that
 
05:12:36.830 --> 05:12:36.840 align:start position:0%
constantly increase on us we have big
 
05:12:38.590 --> 05:12:38.600 align:start position:0%
jumps should that be included in a
 
05:12:40.868 --> 05:12:40.878 align:start position:0%
default budget calculation thank you for
 
05:12:42.868 --> 05:12:42.878 align:start position:0%
the question representative grun my
 
05:12:45.548 --> 05:12:45.558 align:start position:0%
understanding is that if you have a
 
05:12:47.948 --> 05:12:47.958 align:start position:0%
continuing contract those escalating
 
05:12:50.750 --> 05:12:50.760 align:start position:0%
costs are part of the default budget
 
05:12:54.310 --> 05:12:54.320 align:start position:0%
today um so you know like a collective
 
05:12:56.708 --> 05:12:56.718 align:start position:0%
bargain agreement that those costs are
 
05:12:58.708 --> 05:12:58.718 align:start position:0%
already built in the default budget for
 
05:13:02.070 --> 05:13:02.080 align:start position:0%
Better or For Worse followup yes so just
 
05:13:04.868 --> 05:13:04.878 align:start position:0%
to clarify um so only if they're soriz
 
05:13:06.830 --> 05:13:06.840 align:start position:0%
and nobody puts Transportation on a
 
05:13:08.670 --> 05:13:08.680 align:start position:0%
special warrant article that lays out
 
05:13:09.990 --> 05:13:10.000 align:start position:0%
the contract contct costs because if the
 
05:13:11.390 --> 05:13:11.400 align:start position:0%
voters vote no then you can't you don't
 
05:13:12.750 --> 05:13:12.760 align:start position:0%
have any cost for transportation so
 
05:13:14.990 --> 05:13:15.000 align:start position:0%
they're always included in a budget so
 
05:13:16.670 --> 05:13:16.680 align:start position:0%
no those increasing costs are not
 
05:13:19.590 --> 05:13:19.600 align:start position:0%
included so that does again should it be
 
05:13:20.868 --> 05:13:20.878 align:start position:0%
included in
 
05:13:24.110 --> 05:13:24.120 align:start position:0%
a in a default budget
 
05:13:27.548 --> 05:13:27.558 align:start position:0%
calculation the escalating costs should
 
05:13:30.628 --> 05:13:30.638 align:start position:0%
be um in a default budget because
 
05:13:32.510 --> 05:13:32.520 align:start position:0%
they're a contract if they're multi-year
 
05:13:35.788 --> 05:13:35.798 align:start position:0%
contract but if you do not if you do not
 
05:13:38.548 --> 05:13:38.558 align:start position:0%
get a contract approved by the voters
 
05:13:40.510 --> 05:13:40.520 align:start position:0%
then has to be a year to year because
 
05:13:41.910 --> 05:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
you haven't brought it forth the voters
 
05:13:44.230 --> 05:13:44.240 align:start position:0%
the voters should be voting on that and
 
05:13:46.110 --> 05:13:46.120 align:start position:0%
we do that in our district that we vote
 
05:13:49.750 --> 05:13:49.760 align:start position:0%
on a five-year um bus contract and that
 
05:13:52.230 --> 05:13:52.240 align:start position:0%
becomes part of the default budget for
 
05:13:57.350 --> 05:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:01.788 --> 05:14:01.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:06.150 --> 05:14:06.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:09.548 --> 05:14:09.558 align:start position:0%
you so at this time I I will add ask is
 
05:14:11.510 --> 05:14:11.520 align:start position:0%
there anyone present who wishes to speak
 
05:14:13.750 --> 05:14:13.760 align:start position:0%
on this bill who has not yet had the
 
05:14:17.590 --> 05:14:17.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity to do so seeing none Vice
 
05:14:22.270 --> 05:14:22.280 align:start position:0%
chairman McDonald will report the blue
 
05:14:29.750 --> 05:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:32.150 --> 05:14:32.160 align:start position:0%
against thank you and with that the
 
05:14:35.150 --> 05:14:35.160 align:start position:0%
public hearing on House Bill 475 local
 
05:14:51.390 --> 05:14:51.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:54.510 --> 05:14:54.520 align:start position:0%
our next hearing is scheduled to begin
 
05:14:57.830 --> 05:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
at 2:30 so that gives us a little over
 
05:15:07.948 --> 05:15:07.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:07.958 --> 05:15:37.910 align:start position:0%

please thank you Mr chairman and

sponsor I appreciate the opportunity to
 
05:30:05.350 --> 05:30:05.360 align:start position:0%
introduce to you today House Bill 228
 
05:30:08.230 --> 05:30:08.240 align:start position:0%
local for your consideration for the
 
05:30:10.548 --> 05:30:10.558 align:start position:0%
record I am representative Diane power I
 
05:30:12.430 --> 05:30:12.440 align:start position:0%
represent the towns of Brookline Mason
 
05:30:14.708 --> 05:30:14.718 align:start position:0%
and Greenville and Hillsboro County
 
05:30:14.718 --> 05:30:16.110 align:start position:0%
and Greenville and Hillsboro County
District

05:30:16.110 --> 05:30:16.120 align:start position:0%
District
 
05:30:19.150 --> 05:30:19.160 align:start position:0%
36 under current law registered voters
 
05:30:21.470 --> 05:30:21.480 align:start position:0%
May petition the governing body to
 
05:30:23.470 --> 05:30:23.480 align:start position:0%
include their petitioned warrant
 
05:30:26.590 --> 05:30:26.600 align:start position:0%
articles on the warrant at an annual or
 
05:30:29.150 --> 05:30:29.160 align:start position:0%
special meeting and this is provided for
 
05:30:34.350 --> 05:30:34.360 align:start position:0%
under RSA 39 colon 3 as well as um RSA
 
05:30:38.390 --> 05:30:38.400 align:start position:0%
197 colon 6 for school districts the
 
05:30:41.548 --> 05:30:41.558 align:start position:0%
problem is that citizens are reporting
 
05:30:43.948 --> 05:30:43.958 align:start position:0%
more frequently that their petitioned
 
05:30:46.548 --> 05:30:46.558 align:start position:0%
warrant articles are not being handled
 
05:30:49.510 --> 05:30:49.520 align:start position:0%
fairly nor with respect at town and
 
05:30:52.270 --> 05:30:52.280 align:start position:0%
school district meetings as a result
 
05:30:54.390 --> 05:30:54.400 align:start position:0%
discussion and debate of petitioned
 
05:30:57.230 --> 05:30:57.240 align:start position:0%
Warrant articles is being severely
 
05:31:01.110 --> 05:31:01.120 align:start position:0%
limited or it doesn't happen at all in
 
05:31:03.190 --> 05:31:03.200 align:start position:0%
and in traditional meetings petition
 
05:31:05.990 --> 05:31:06.000 align:start position:0%
warrant articles aren't even being voted
 
05:31:09.190 --> 05:31:09.200 align:start position:0%
upon by the legisl ative body
 
05:31:11.510 --> 05:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
unfortunately in many towns and school
 
05:31:14.070 --> 05:31:14.080 align:start position:0%
districts petitioned warrant articles
 
05:31:17.788 --> 05:31:17.798 align:start position:0%
are regarded as second class um warrant
 
05:31:20.750 --> 05:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
articles by many governing bodies as
 
05:31:24.270 --> 05:31:24.280 align:start position:0%
well as meeting and attendees and this
 
05:31:28.270 --> 05:31:28.280 align:start position:0%
sentiment is evidenced by um comments in
 
05:31:29.310 --> 05:31:29.320 align:start position:0%
uh open
 
05:31:32.628 --> 05:31:32.638 align:start position:0%
meetings for example I recently learned
 
05:31:35.910 --> 05:31:35.920 align:start position:0%
um of one instance where a school board
 
05:31:38.470 --> 05:31:38.480 align:start position:0%
in fact was coordinating with the
 
05:31:41.948 --> 05:31:41.958 align:start position:0%
moderator ahead of the annual meeting to
 
05:31:44.030 --> 05:31:44.040 align:start position:0%
develop rules to
 
05:31:47.110 --> 05:31:47.120 align:start position:0%
limit both the time and the opportunity
 
05:31:50.030 --> 05:31:50.040 align:start position:0%
for petition warrant articles to be
 
05:31:54.390 --> 05:31:54.400 align:start position:0%
presented at the annual meeting clearly
 
05:31:57.310 --> 05:31:57.320 align:start position:0%
this is wrong and it's a clear abuse of
 
05:31:59.230 --> 05:31:59.240 align:start position:0%
our system of
 
05:32:02.390 --> 05:32:02.400 align:start position:0%
democracy to be clear annual and special
 
05:32:04.708 --> 05:32:04.718 align:start position:0%
meetings belong to all
 
05:32:07.910 --> 05:32:07.920 align:start position:0%
voters and not just the governing body
 
05:32:11.548 --> 05:32:11.558 align:start position:0%
or certain groups of people so the
 
05:32:15.628 --> 05:32:15.638 align:start position:0%
solution is House Bill 228 this
 
05:32:18.750 --> 05:32:18.760 align:start position:0%
addresses these problems by first
 
05:32:22.030 --> 05:32:22.040 align:start position:0%
identifying a primary petitioner as one
 
05:32:24.310 --> 05:32:24.320 align:start position:0%
of the registered voters on the
 
05:32:26.590 --> 05:32:26.600 align:start position:0%
application um for the petitioned
 
05:32:26.600 --> 05:32:27.590 align:start position:0%
application um for the petitioned
warrant

05:32:27.590 --> 05:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
warrant
 
05:32:30.990 --> 05:32:31.000 align:start position:0%
article or in the absence of an
 
05:32:34.030 --> 05:32:34.040 align:start position:0%
identified primary petitioner the
 
05:32:37.190 --> 05:32:37.200 align:start position:0%
primary petitioner shall be the first
 
05:32:39.948 --> 05:32:39.958 align:start position:0%
petitioner our registered voter listed
 
05:32:42.868 --> 05:32:42.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:46.110 --> 05:32:46.120 align:start position:0%
application Additionally the bill also
 
05:32:49.310 --> 05:32:49.320 align:start position:0%
allows that the primary petitioner May
 
05:32:53.070 --> 05:32:53.080 align:start position:0%
designate any registered voter to act as
 
05:32:56.230 --> 05:32:56.240 align:start position:0%
the primary petitioner by notifying the
 
05:32:59.750 --> 05:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
moderator of such in writing for example
 
05:33:01.948 --> 05:33:01.958 align:start position:0%
the primary petitioner might not be
 
05:33:04.310 --> 05:33:04.320 align:start position:0%
available for the meeting and this
 
05:33:07.230 --> 05:33:07.240 align:start position:0%
provision allows for another individual
 
05:33:08.350 --> 05:33:08.360 align:start position:0%
to fulfill
 
05:33:11.548 --> 05:33:11.558 align:start position:0%
that role the bill further addresses um
 
05:33:13.310 --> 05:33:13.320 align:start position:0%
the problems that I outlined by
 
05:33:15.868 --> 05:33:15.878 align:start position:0%
requiring that the moderator shall
 
05:33:18.310 --> 05:33:18.320 align:start position:0%
provide the primary petitioner the
 
05:33:21.430 --> 05:33:21.440 align:start position:0%
opportunity to introduce the petitioned
 
05:33:23.110 --> 05:33:23.120 align:start position:0%
article at the
 
05:33:26.470 --> 05:33:26.480 align:start position:0%
meeting and also the primary petitioner
 
05:33:29.270 --> 05:33:29.280 align:start position:0%
shall also be guaranteed at least the
 
05:33:32.990 --> 05:33:33.000 align:start position:0%
same amount of of time as the longest
 
05:33:35.990 --> 05:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
time granted to the governing body or
 
05:33:38.830 --> 05:33:38.840 align:start position:0%
the budget committee if there is one to
 
05:33:41.310 --> 05:33:41.320 align:start position:0%
introduce any of their warrant articles
 
05:33:42.150 --> 05:33:42.160 align:start position:0%
at the
 
05:33:44.948 --> 05:33:44.958 align:start position:0%
meeting to conclude the simple change to
 
05:33:47.628 --> 05:33:47.638 align:start position:0%
the current law levels the playing field
 
05:33:50.830 --> 05:33:50.840 align:start position:0%
by giving both elected officials and
 
05:33:54.548 --> 05:33:54.558 align:start position:0%
citizens fair and Equitable time and
 
05:33:57.590 --> 05:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity to present all warrant
 
05:34:00.628 --> 05:34:00.638 align:start position:0%
articles at an annual or special meeting
 
05:34:04.350 --> 05:34:04.360 align:start position:0%
regardless of who places that article on
 
05:34:08.070 --> 05:34:08.080 align:start position:0%
the warrant and also by allowing ing
 
05:34:10.548 --> 05:34:10.558 align:start position:0%
that all warrant articles have the
 
05:34:13.548 --> 05:34:13.558 align:start position:0%
opportunity to be debated discussed and
 
05:34:17.230 --> 05:34:17.240 align:start position:0%
actually voted on thereby protecting and
 
05:34:19.628 --> 05:34:19.638 align:start position:0%
preserving the Democratic meeting
 
05:34:23.350 --> 05:34:23.360 align:start position:0%
process for all participants to me it's
 
05:34:25.390 --> 05:34:25.400 align:start position:0%
a matter of fairness and for these
 
05:34:28.510 --> 05:34:28.520 align:start position:0%
reasons I would urge this committee to
 
05:34:32.190 --> 05:34:32.200 align:start position:0%
recommend House Bill 228 ought to pass
 
05:34:34.548 --> 05:34:34.558 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman that concludes my
 
05:34:36.830 --> 05:34:36.840 align:start position:0%
bill introduction and I'm happy to take
 
05:34:39.430 --> 05:34:39.440 align:start position:0%

thank you representative Powers uh any
 
05:34:42.788 --> 05:34:42.798 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
05:34:45.750 --> 05:34:45.760 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
05:34:51.350 --> 05:34:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:57.548 --> 05:34:57.558 align:start position:0%
chair you use the word may um line 21
 
05:34:57.558 --> 05:34:58.750 align:start position:0%
chair you use the word may um line 21
for

05:34:58.750 --> 05:34:58.760 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:35:00.788 --> 05:35:00.798 align:start position:0%
example that
 
05:35:05.310 --> 05:35:05.320 align:start position:0%
the application May identify these
 
05:35:07.990 --> 05:35:08.000 align:start position:0%
registered voters
 
05:35:10.470 --> 05:35:10.480 align:start position:0%
who who
 
05:35:12.708 --> 05:35:12.718 align:start position:0%
determines that
 
05:35:17.470 --> 05:35:17.480 align:start position:0%
this would occur than how is it adopted
 
05:35:19.350 --> 05:35:19.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for the for the question
 
05:35:21.390 --> 05:35:21.400 align:start position:0%
representative so what that's referring
 
05:35:24.270 --> 05:35:24.280 align:start position:0%
to is that when you have a petitioned
 
05:35:27.430 --> 05:35:27.440 align:start position:0%
warrant article there's an application
 
05:35:29.788 --> 05:35:29.798 align:start position:0%
it's it's the petition and there's
 
05:35:32.670 --> 05:35:32.680 align:start position:0%
certain um there's information that's
 
05:35:34.750 --> 05:35:34.760 align:start position:0%
required on that and what was meant by
 
05:35:37.110 --> 05:35:37.120 align:start position:0%
this with regards to identifying a
 
05:35:40.310 --> 05:35:40.320 align:start position:0%
primary petitioner is that on that uh
 
05:35:43.030 --> 05:35:43.040 align:start position:0%
application if you will the application
 
05:35:46.030 --> 05:35:46.040 align:start position:0%
will identify this is the primary
 
05:35:51.548 --> 05:35:51.558 align:start position:0%
petitioner so um I for those of you who
 
05:35:53.270 --> 05:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
may or may not be familiar with petition
 
05:35:56.910 --> 05:35:56.920 align:start position:0%
Warren articles often times several
 
05:36:02.070 --> 05:36:02.080 align:start position:0%
copies are circulated and um so in terms
 
05:36:03.910 --> 05:36:03.920 align:start position:0%
of the signature line and the
 
05:36:05.350 --> 05:36:05.360 align:start position:0%
information that's
 
05:36:09.430 --> 05:36:09.440 align:start position:0%
needed there's um multiple I guess I
 
05:36:12.350 --> 05:36:12.360 align:start position:0%
would say line ones so therefore when
 
05:36:16.150 --> 05:36:16.160 align:start position:0%
the petition is passed in the people who
 
05:36:17.670 --> 05:36:17.680 align:start position:0%
signed the

or implemented within a
 
05:37:06.830 --> 05:37:06.840 align:start position:0%
town uh this this if this bill were to
 
05:37:08.910 --> 05:37:08.920 align:start position:0%
become law
 
05:37:13.270 --> 05:37:13.280 align:start position:0%
it would um be implemented as any other
 
05:37:15.990 --> 05:37:16.000 align:start position:0%
RSA is implemented within a town or a
 
05:37:16.000 --> 05:37:17.430 align:start position:0%

district okay I'm
 
05:37:22.868 --> 05:37:22.878 align:start position:0%
sorry it's okay I think that it has to
 
05:37:25.510 --> 05:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
do with the process I'm not
 
05:37:26.830 --> 05:37:26.840 align:start position:0%
understanding your question but there is
 
05:37:29.190 --> 05:37:29.200 align:start position:0%
a process already in statute that
 
05:37:32.070 --> 05:37:32.080 align:start position:0%
governs or pertains to petition Warr
 
05:37:35.150 --> 05:37:35.160 align:start position:0%

representative
 
05:37:44.830 --> 05:37:44.840 align:start position:0%
majori thank you Mr Vice chairman so in
 
05:37:47.868 --> 05:37:47.878 align:start position:0%
the exact same word why is that word may
 
05:37:50.270 --> 05:37:50.280 align:start position:0%
there and not shall if in the next
 
05:37:53.310 --> 05:37:53.320 align:start position:0%
sentence it shall be the first voter or
 
05:37:56.230 --> 05:37:56.240 align:start position:0%
the the first the first registered
 
05:37:58.110 --> 05:37:58.120 align:start position:0%
voter thank you for the question
 
05:38:01.190 --> 05:38:01.200 align:start position:0%
representative so you're asking in line
 
05:38:04.070 --> 05:38:04.080 align:start position:0%
21 why it says may identify correct
 
05:38:06.430 --> 05:38:06.440 align:start position:0%
because that's an option so on the
 
05:38:08.868 --> 05:38:08.878 align:start position:0%
written application for the petitioned
 
05:38:11.750 --> 05:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
warrant article the petitioners can
 
05:38:14.750 --> 05:38:14.760 align:start position:0%
designate this person on on this set of
 
05:38:17.150 --> 05:38:17.160 align:start position:0%
signature sheets this is the the the
 
05:38:20.430 --> 05:38:20.440 align:start position:0%
primary petitioner and in the absence of
 
05:38:20.440 --> 05:38:21.708 align:start position:0%
primary petitioner and in the absence of
that

05:38:21.708 --> 05:38:21.718 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:38:24.190 --> 05:38:24.200 align:start position:0%
then if
 
05:38:26.788 --> 05:38:26.798 align:start position:0%
no if no primary petitioner is
 
05:38:28.590 --> 05:38:28.600 align:start position:0%
identified the primary petitioner shall
 
05:38:30.750 --> 05:38:30.760 align:start position:0%
be the first registered voter listed on
 
05:38:33.910 --> 05:38:33.920 align:start position:0%
the application okay well that's a
 
05:38:37.548 --> 05:38:37.558 align:start position:0%
little confusing I admit because I just
 
05:38:39.990 --> 05:38:40.000 align:start position:0%
went and explain that we have multiple
 
05:38:43.110 --> 05:38:43.120 align:start position:0%
sheets right so this I just explain this
 
05:38:45.948 --> 05:38:45.958 align:start position:0%
multiple line ones um I have to think
 
05:38:45.958 --> 05:38:50.190 align:start position:0%
multiple line ones um I have to think
about

05:38:50.190 --> 05:38:50.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:53.510 --> 05:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
that a followup
 
05:38:55.670 --> 05:38:55.680 align:start position:0%
representative well sure and I and I
 
05:38:57.230 --> 05:38:57.240 align:start position:0%

unfortunately
 
05:40:03.788 --> 05:40:03.798 align:start position:0%
I representative Elwood's question it
 
05:40:05.830 --> 05:40:05.840 align:start position:0%
wasn't clear to me
 
05:40:09.390 --> 05:40:09.400 align:start position:0%
so your question question seems to be
 
05:40:16.390 --> 05:40:16.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:16.400 --> 05:40:19.430 align:start position:0%

05:40:22.510 --> 05:40:22.520 align:start position:0%
followup so if it says
 
05:40:26.150 --> 05:40:26.160 align:start position:0%

05:40:26.160 --> 05:40:27.510 align:start position:0%
shall then it shall and that's the
enforcement

05:40:27.510 --> 05:40:27.520 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
05:40:34.230 --> 05:40:34.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:38.910 --> 05:40:38.920 align:start position:0%

05:40:49.150 --> 05:40:49.160 align:start position:0%
at this time I'd like to carefully um
 
05:40:52.390 --> 05:40:52.400 align:start position:0%
think about it because
 
05:40:55.750 --> 05:40:55.760 align:start position:0%
I I thought that I in my mind I had the
 
05:40:58.670 --> 05:40:58.680 align:start position:0%
language clear in my mind but obviously
 
05:41:01.430 --> 05:41:01.440 align:start position:0%
when other people see language they see
 
05:41:03.910 --> 05:41:03.920 align:start position:0%
different things and I'm having trouble
 
05:41:07.750 --> 05:41:07.760 align:start position:0%

05:44:08.120 --> 05:44:09.750 align:start position:0%
moderator where's that ag2 line 22
okay

05:44:09.750 --> 05:44:09.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:44:12.030 --> 05:44:12.040 align:start position:0%
so in my
 
05:44:14.788 --> 05:44:14.798 align:start position:0%
example it was the planning board
 
05:44:18.468 --> 05:44:18.478 align:start position:0%
chairman who held the public hearing on
 
05:44:18.478 --> 05:44:19.948 align:start position:0%
chairman who held the public hearing on
the

05:44:19.948 --> 05:44:19.958 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:44:24.590 --> 05:44:24.600 align:start position:0%
petitioned zoning ordinance
 
05:44:30.270 --> 05:44:30.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:32.990 --> 05:44:33.000 align:start position:0%
language in either include a planning
 
05:44:35.270 --> 05:44:35.280 align:start position:0%
board chairman
 
05:44:38.628 --> 05:44:38.638 align:start position:0%
or because the moderator not was not
 
05:44:40.868 --> 05:44:40.878 align:start position:0%
involved thank you representative I
 
05:44:43.430 --> 05:44:43.440 align:start position:0%
appreciate that question if you look on
 
05:44:46.590 --> 05:44:46.600 align:start position:0%
line 19 this is section four of the bill
 
05:44:49.310 --> 05:44:49.320 align:start position:0%
and it says government of town meeting
 
05:44:50.430 --> 05:44:50.440 align:start position:0%
and it
 
05:44:53.750 --> 05:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
references specifically debate so this
 
05:44:56.468 --> 05:44:56.478 align:start position:0%
section here pertains to the town
 
05:44:59.868 --> 05:44:59.878 align:start position:0%
meeting and the town meeting process of
 
05:45:02.310 --> 05:45:02.320 align:start position:0%
handling warrant articles you raised the
 
05:45:05.070 --> 05:45:05.080 align:start position:0%
issue with regards to uh zoning
 
05:45:07.510 --> 05:45:07.520 align:start position:0%
ordinance petition War an article
 
05:45:11.670 --> 05:45:11.680 align:start position:0%
which requires a hearing and this bill
 
05:45:11.680 --> 05:45:13.150 align:start position:0%
which requires a hearing and this bill
here

05:45:13.150 --> 05:45:13.160 align:start position:0%
here
 
05:45:20.670 --> 05:45:20.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:23.510 --> 05:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
se yeah one last question
 
05:45:26.548 --> 05:45:26.558 align:start position:0%
represent so I guess my question is
 
05:45:31.468 --> 05:45:31.478 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:34.708 --> 05:45:34.718 align:start position:0%
addresses public hearings by
 
05:45:38.708 --> 05:45:38.718 align:start position:0%
zoning uh uh by planning boards
 
05:45:40.548 --> 05:45:40.558 align:start position:0%
or thank you for the question
 
05:45:42.070 --> 05:45:42.080 align:start position:0%
representative I would have to go back
 
05:45:46.190 --> 05:45:46.200 align:start position:0%
and look at the rsas that pertain to to
 
05:45:48.830 --> 05:45:48.840 align:start position:0%
hearings and I would need to understand
 
05:45:51.230 --> 05:45:51.240 align:start position:0%
specifically in your instance what
 
05:45:53.590 --> 05:45:53.600 align:start position:0%
exactly happened and what the provisions
 
05:45:56.430 --> 05:45:56.440 align:start position:0%
are with regards to rsas with regards to
 
05:46:00.230 --> 05:46:00.240 align:start position:0%
hearings to see if perhap what happened
 
05:46:00.240 --> 05:46:01.390 align:start position:0%
hearings to see if perhap what happened
was

05:46:01.390 --> 05:46:01.400 align:start position:0%
was
 
05:46:05.430 --> 05:46:05.440 align:start position:0%
um not consistent with RSA that what
 
05:46:07.548 --> 05:46:07.558 align:start position:0%
you're describing is is like I said
 
05:46:09.548 --> 05:46:09.558 align:start position:0%
something completely different has to do
 
05:46:14.110 --> 05:46:14.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:16.708 --> 05:46:16.718 align:start position:0%
meetings representative
 
05:46:19.350 --> 05:46:19.360 align:start position:0%
Murphy thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
05:46:21.948 --> 05:46:21.958 align:start position:0%
taking my question our planning board
 
05:46:28.390 --> 05:46:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:30.990 --> 05:46:31.000 align:start position:0%
amendable thank you for the question
 
05:46:33.788 --> 05:46:33.798 align:start position:0%
representative I'm not sure how that
 
05:46:42.830 --> 05:46:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:45.430 --> 05:46:45.440 align:start position:0%
are the
 
05:46:45.440 --> 05:46:47.270 align:start position:0%
are the
what

05:46:47.270 --> 05:46:47.280 align:start position:0%
what
 
05:46:49.990 --> 05:46:50.000 align:start position:0%
followup go ahead we're talking about
 
05:46:52.310 --> 05:46:52.320 align:start position:0%
Warren articles and I'm talking about a
 
05:46:56.150 --> 05:46:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:58.990 --> 05:46:59.000 align:start position:0%
article PL so the question is with
 
05:47:00.990 --> 05:47:01.000 align:start position:0%
regards to and I think you probably know
 
05:47:03.948 --> 05:47:03.958 align:start position:0%
the answer to this um but are your the
 
05:47:06.350 --> 05:47:06.360 align:start position:0%
question is are planning B are warrant
 
05:47:06.360 --> 05:47:07.750 align:start position:0%
question is are planning B are warrant
articles

05:47:07.750 --> 05:47:07.760 align:start position:0%
articles
 
05:47:11.708 --> 05:47:11.718 align:start position:0%
put up by the planning board
 
05:47:14.830 --> 05:47:14.840 align:start position:0%
amendable planning board waren
 
05:47:18.230 --> 05:47:18.240 align:start position:0%
articles pertain to zoning ordinances
 
05:47:20.190 --> 05:47:20.200 align:start position:0%
and I do not believe that they are
 
05:47:22.230 --> 05:47:22.240 align:start position:0%
amendable I could be wrong I don't know
 
05:47:25.430 --> 05:47:25.440 align:start position:0%
but I'm happy to get the correct answer
 
05:47:30.270 --> 05:47:30.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:34.468 --> 05:47:34.478 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:36.510 --> 05:47:36.520 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for
 
05:47:48.548 --> 05:47:48.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:50.910 --> 05:47:50.920 align:start position:0%
representative okay our next speaker is
 
05:48:08.070 --> 05:48:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:09.628 --> 05:48:09.638 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr Vice chair and
 
05:48:11.230 --> 05:48:11.240 align:start position:0%
committee members for the record my name
 
05:48:14.788 --> 05:48:14.798 align:start position:0%
is Eric power I'm from Brookline and I'm
 
05:48:16.150 --> 05:48:16.160 align:start position:0%
in favor of this article and I'm
 
05:48:18.948 --> 05:48:18.958 align:start position:0%
representing myself um I think this is
 
05:48:22.910 --> 05:48:22.920 align:start position:0%
an important uh bill because I think it
 
05:48:26.868 --> 05:48:26.878 align:start position:0%
it helps uh provide some civility to uh
 
05:48:29.910 --> 05:48:29.920 align:start position:0%
annual me annual and special meetings
 
05:48:31.510 --> 05:48:31.520 align:start position:0%
where there's petition warn articles
 
05:48:34.590 --> 05:48:34.600 align:start position:0%
that have been proposed um increasingly
 
05:48:36.990 --> 05:48:37.000 align:start position:0%
we're seeing and and I've heard
 
05:48:40.270 --> 05:48:40.280 align:start position:0%
personally experienced it that um warn
 
05:48:43.548 --> 05:48:43.558 align:start position:0%
articles at meetings are not even heard
 
05:48:47.310 --> 05:48:47.320 align:start position:0%
they are tabled and you don't even get
 
05:48:50.230 --> 05:48:50.240 align:start position:0%
to speak to them and I have coordinated
 
05:48:52.468 --> 05:48:52.478 align:start position:0%
with moderators before and gotten some
 
05:48:55.430 --> 05:48:55.440 align:start position:0%
time but it doesn't always work out um
 
05:48:58.150 --> 05:48:58.160 align:start position:0%
because the meeting doesn't want to even
 
05:49:00.708 --> 05:49:00.718 align:start position:0%
hear about the article so that's a
 
05:49:04.110 --> 05:49:04.120 align:start position:0%
problem um I'd like to mention there was
 
05:49:07.430 --> 05:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
a question about the sh versus May on
 
05:49:11.468 --> 05:49:11.478 align:start position:0%
the um identifying a registered voter on
 
05:49:11.478 --> 05:49:12.390 align:start position:0%
the um identifying a registered voter on
an

05:49:12.390 --> 05:49:12.400 align:start position:0%
an
 
05:49:14.270 --> 05:49:14.280 align:start position:0%
application uh I mean a primary
 
05:49:15.948 --> 05:49:15.958 align:start position:0%
petitioner on an application and I would
 
05:49:17.990 --> 05:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
say if you put the Sha in there then
 
05:49:20.510 --> 05:49:20.520 align:start position:0%
that's another way for a uh governing
 
05:49:24.708 --> 05:49:24.718 align:start position:0%
body to disqualify a um petition to say
 
05:49:26.230 --> 05:49:26.240 align:start position:0%
well they didn't identify a primary
 
05:49:29.430 --> 05:49:29.440 align:start position:0%
petitioner so do you want we have we
 
05:49:31.190 --> 05:49:31.200 align:start position:0%
don't accept it so maybe leaving it as a
 
05:49:32.990 --> 05:49:33.000 align:start position:0%
May would be good that we can talk about
 
05:49:37.548 --> 05:49:37.558 align:start position:0%
that more um if you'd like um
 
05:49:38.948 --> 05:49:38.958 align:start position:0%
but I'd like to mention you know putting
 
05:49:40.830 --> 05:49:40.840 align:start position:0%
in a petition warn article is not a
 
05:49:43.150 --> 05:49:43.160 align:start position:0%
trivial thing you have to get the
 
05:49:46.468 --> 05:49:46.478 align:start position:0%
language right you have to go get 25
 
05:49:49.350 --> 05:49:49.360 align:start position:0%
signatures at least from fellow citizens
 
05:49:50.788 --> 05:49:50.798 align:start position:0%
and put it in well ahead of these
 
05:49:52.430 --> 05:49:52.440 align:start position:0%
meetings some of the deadlines if you
 
05:49:55.548 --> 05:49:55.558 align:start position:0%
have S SP2 are in early January some of
 
05:49:56.948 --> 05:49:56.958 align:start position:0%
them are in late January if a
 
05:49:58.510 --> 05:49:58.520 align:start position:0%
traditional meeting there are even some
 
05:50:00.510 --> 05:50:00.520 align:start position:0%
and I did one this year that was due by
 
05:50:03.270 --> 05:50:03.280 align:start position:0%
December 15th so these are not small
 
05:50:05.430 --> 05:50:05.440 align:start position:0%
tasks and then to not even have them
 
05:50:09.030 --> 05:50:09.040 align:start position:0%
heard is not really fair and people um
 
05:50:11.548 --> 05:50:11.558 align:start position:0%
last year I had five at our town meeting
 
05:50:13.868 --> 05:50:13.878 align:start position:0%
and four of them didn't even get a even
 
05:50:17.310 --> 05:50:17.320 align:start position:0%
get to be talked about um mercifully one
 
05:50:18.628 --> 05:50:18.638 align:start position:0%
of them they did talk about and people
 
05:50:20.628 --> 05:50:20.638 align:start position:0%
said wow once I heard that I decided to
 
05:50:21.868 --> 05:50:21.878 align:start position:0%
vote for it and they passed it it was
 
05:50:25.190 --> 05:50:25.200 align:start position:0%
actually the tax impact one so you know
 
05:50:26.910 --> 05:50:26.920 align:start position:0%
it's a little courtesy to give people
 
05:50:29.430 --> 05:50:29.440 align:start position:0%
the chance to be heard and I'd like to
 
05:50:31.628 --> 05:50:31.638 align:start position:0%
say that's kind of how the general court
 
05:50:34.230 --> 05:50:34.240 align:start position:0%
Works everybody that files a bill and
 
05:50:35.750 --> 05:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
some people don't like this but every
 
05:50:39.270 --> 05:50:39.280 align:start position:0%
Bill gets a hearing like this every and
 
05:50:40.670 --> 05:50:40.680 align:start position:0%
I know there was a there was actually
 
05:50:42.548 --> 05:50:42.558 align:start position:0%
some rule proposed this year to actually
 
05:50:44.350 --> 05:50:44.360 align:start position:0%
table bills out of committee before they
 
05:50:46.110 --> 05:50:46.120 align:start position:0%
were heard and I'm glad that that was
 
05:50:47.670 --> 05:50:47.680 align:start position:0%
stopped because every Bill gets a
 
05:50:51.110 --> 05:50:51.120 align:start position:0%
hearing and every Bill gets a vote and
 
05:50:53.030 --> 05:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
so I think this is along the same lines
 
05:50:54.830 --> 05:50:54.840 align:start position:0%
but for our local
 
05:50:57.430 --> 05:50:57.440 align:start position:0%
governance um I think they're you know
 
05:50:58.990 --> 05:50:59.000 align:start position:0%
putting being able to identify a
 
05:51:01.948 --> 05:51:01.958 align:start position:0%
petition warn article um having a
 
05:51:03.788 --> 05:51:03.798 align:start position:0%
primary petitioner identified makes a
 
05:51:06.190 --> 05:51:06.200 align:start position:0%
lot of sense um and then it gives that
 
05:51:08.708 --> 05:51:08.718 align:start position:0%
that person is the spokesperson for that
 
05:51:13.110 --> 05:51:13.120 align:start position:0%
petition and a lot of times they um the
 
05:51:14.750 --> 05:51:14.760 align:start position:0%
governing body may have a question on a
 
05:51:16.788 --> 05:51:16.798 align:start position:0%
petition or they want to notify somebody
 
05:51:18.468 --> 05:51:18.478 align:start position:0%
that a hearing's been scheduled and if
 
05:51:20.510 --> 05:51:20.520 align:start position:0%
they have that person identified as the
 
05:51:22.830 --> 05:51:22.840 align:start position:0%
primary petitioner that makes it easier
 
05:51:24.350 --> 05:51:24.360 align:start position:0%
otherwise they don't know who it is it's
 
05:51:26.070 --> 05:51:26.080 align:start position:0%
not always the first person that signs
 
05:51:28.628 --> 05:51:28.638 align:start position:0%
it and there's no particular status that
 
05:51:31.708 --> 05:51:31.718 align:start position:0%
any petitioner has over another um in
 
05:51:34.750 --> 05:51:34.760 align:start position:0%
terms of being a spokesperson so I think
 
05:51:36.708 --> 05:51:36.718 align:start position:0%
that makes a lot of sense logistically
 
05:51:38.590 --> 05:51:38.600 align:start position:0%
and I think it will it just goes a long
 
05:51:42.628 --> 05:51:42.638 align:start position:0%
way to having the town meeting school
 
05:51:45.430 --> 05:51:45.440 align:start position:0%
district meetings run more smoothly when
 
05:51:48.868 --> 05:51:48.878 align:start position:0%
everybody can be heard and you know in
 
05:51:50.670 --> 05:51:50.680 align:start position:0%
most cases you vote on them i' I'd like
 
05:51:52.948 --> 05:51:52.958 align:start position:0%
to mention that under the sb2 form of
 
05:51:56.150 --> 05:51:56.160 align:start position:0%
meeting one advantage of sb2 is that
 
05:51:57.750 --> 05:51:57.760 align:start position:0%
actually every warrant article gets a
 
05:51:59.190 --> 05:51:59.200 align:start position:0%
vote it goes from the deliberative
 
05:52:00.788 --> 05:52:00.798 align:start position:0%
session onto the ballot there's no
 
05:52:02.990 --> 05:52:03.000 align:start position:0%
option to stop it from even being voted
 
05:52:05.750 --> 05:52:05.760 align:start position:0%
on the disadvantage of a town meeting is
 
05:52:07.468 --> 05:52:07.478 align:start position:0%
that people could table an article and
 
05:52:09.590 --> 05:52:09.600 align:start position:0%
you never you never even vote on it and
 
05:52:10.910 --> 05:52:10.920 align:start position:0%
sometimes you don't even hear about it
 
05:52:13.350 --> 05:52:13.360 align:start position:0%
so um that's a that's a that's a
 
05:52:14.708 --> 05:52:14.718 align:start position:0%
challenge and that probably is another
 
05:52:16.708 --> 05:52:16.718 align:start position:0%
problem to be fixed at another day but
 
05:52:18.788 --> 05:52:18.798 align:start position:0%
at least for the petitioners to be heard
 
05:52:21.708 --> 05:52:21.718 align:start position:0%
this is a very good bill um and
 
05:52:23.510 --> 05:52:23.520 align:start position:0%
petitions come in different flavors and
 
05:52:25.670 --> 05:52:25.680 align:start position:0%
I I heard a little bit about a
 
05:52:28.628 --> 05:52:28.638 align:start position:0%
zoning uh a zoning amendment by petition
 
05:52:30.990 --> 05:52:31.000 align:start position:0%
Warren article and as I mentioned
 
05:52:33.350 --> 05:52:33.360 align:start position:0%
earlier I do serve on the Brookline
 
05:52:35.310 --> 05:52:35.320 align:start position:0%
planning board so I'm very familiar with
 
05:52:39.110 --> 05:52:39.120 align:start position:0%
zoning amend ments and it is true once a
 
05:52:40.910 --> 05:52:40.920 align:start position:0%
zoning amendment is filed by petition
 
05:52:42.708 --> 05:52:42.718 align:start position:0%
that's due very early as well I think
 
05:52:45.350 --> 05:52:45.360 align:start position:0%
it's due even maybe there's a window it
 
05:52:46.548 --> 05:52:46.558 align:start position:0%
has to be submitted and I think it's
 
05:52:48.830 --> 05:52:48.840 align:start position:0%
between like mid November and mid
 
05:52:50.468 --> 05:52:50.478 align:start position:0%
December because you have to have
 
05:52:53.590 --> 05:52:53.600 align:start position:0%
hearings and such um and there are a few
 
05:52:56.270 --> 05:52:56.280 align:start position:0%
other uh pieces of legislation with that
 
05:52:58.030 --> 05:52:58.040 align:start position:0%
are official ballot questions that will
 
05:52:59.708 --> 05:52:59.718 align:start position:0%
never make it to a deliberative session
 
05:53:02.190 --> 05:53:02.200 align:start position:0%
because they go right on the ballot this
 
05:53:03.468 --> 05:53:03.478 align:start position:0%
does not address those because they
 
05:53:05.190 --> 05:53:05.200 align:start position:0%
don't go to the meeting but that could
 
05:53:07.590 --> 05:53:07.600 align:start position:0%
be a subject of a an amendment or
 
05:53:10.150 --> 05:53:10.160 align:start position:0%
potentially another uh part of uh
 
05:53:12.830 --> 05:53:12.840 align:start position:0%
another bill at another time to address
 
05:53:15.190 --> 05:53:15.200 align:start position:0%
these these more special type of
 
05:53:16.910 --> 05:53:16.920 align:start position:0%
petition warrant articles those need to
 
05:53:20.030 --> 05:53:20.040 align:start position:0%
be heard as well um no one should be
 
05:53:21.548 --> 05:53:21.558 align:start position:0%
shut down that everybody deserves a
 
05:53:24.590 --> 05:53:24.600 align:start position:0%
chance to be heard so um I think this is
 
05:53:26.270 --> 05:53:26.280 align:start position:0%
a good bill I think it would go a long
 
05:53:28.468 --> 05:53:28.478 align:start position:0%
way to help make things run more
 
05:53:29.948 --> 05:53:29.958 align:start position:0%
smoothly when everybody has the
 
05:53:32.390 --> 05:53:32.400 align:start position:0%
expectation set that you know this is
 
05:53:33.868 --> 05:53:33.878 align:start position:0%
the way that petition Warren articles
 
05:53:35.948 --> 05:53:35.958 align:start position:0%
would work they'll get respected and
 
05:53:37.868 --> 05:53:37.878 align:start position:0%
everybody will be heard and that the
 
05:53:40.270 --> 05:53:40.280 align:start position:0%
meeting will go more smoothly and
 
05:53:42.868 --> 05:53:42.878 align:start position:0%
democracy will work better so for those
 
05:53:45.390 --> 05:53:45.400 align:start position:0%
reasons I would recommend uh to pass on
 
05:53:49.990 --> 05:53:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:53.548 --> 05:53:53.558 align:start position:0%
questions I have a question for Mr poers
 
05:53:55.708 --> 05:53:55.718 align:start position:0%
as this bill is written it won't app
 
05:53:59.670 --> 05:53:59.680 align:start position:0%
apply to deliberative sessions in SP2
 
05:54:01.708 --> 05:54:01.718 align:start position:0%
towns thank you for the question yes it
 
05:54:03.910 --> 05:54:03.920 align:start position:0%
would apply to deliberative session at a
 
05:54:06.868 --> 05:54:06.878 align:start position:0%
an sb2 town or School District
 
05:54:08.628 --> 05:54:08.638 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have to be mentioned in the
 
05:54:10.230 --> 05:54:10.240 align:start position:0%
right now it's just Town
 
05:54:12.270 --> 05:54:12.280 align:start position:0%
meetings it doesn't say anything about
 
05:54:14.430 --> 05:54:14.440 align:start position:0%
SP2 that I can find in inside in the
 
05:54:17.708 --> 05:54:17.718 align:start position:0%
bill itself correct it does um it does
 
05:54:20.070 --> 05:54:20.080 align:start position:0%
not apply just to SP2 deliberative
 
05:54:21.670 --> 05:54:21.680 align:start position:0%
sessions it applies to traditional
 
05:54:23.150 --> 05:54:23.160 align:start position:0%
meetings so it's not mentioned because
 
05:54:25.788 --> 05:54:25.798 align:start position:0%
it applies to both okay when you have a
 
05:54:28.030 --> 05:54:28.040 align:start position:0%
petition warn article under SP2 it's
 
05:54:29.708 --> 05:54:29.718 align:start position:0%
heard at a deliberative session and it
 
05:54:31.628 --> 05:54:31.638 align:start position:0%
debated and potentially amended at a
 
05:54:33.750 --> 05:54:33.760 align:start position:0%
traditional meeting it's debated and
 
05:54:36.070 --> 05:54:36.080 align:start position:0%
potentially voted upon there so it's
 
05:54:37.830 --> 05:54:37.840 align:start position:0%
same place it's either going to be heard
 
05:54:39.548 --> 05:54:39.558 align:start position:0%
at a deliberative session or heard at a
 
05:54:40.868 --> 05:54:40.878 align:start position:0%
traditional meeting that's the purpose
 
05:54:40.878 --> 05:54:41.670 align:start position:0%
traditional meeting that's the purpose
of

05:54:41.670 --> 05:54:41.680 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:54:44.110 --> 05:54:44.120 align:start position:0%
this there's been occasions in my town
 
05:54:45.910 --> 05:54:45.920 align:start position:0%
we'll have a petition War article and no
 
05:54:47.788 --> 05:54:47.798 align:start position:0%
one will show up to talk to it to speak
 
05:54:52.590 --> 05:54:52.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:55.150 --> 05:54:55.160 align:start position:0%
or the if there's nobody there to speak
 
05:54:56.830 --> 05:54:56.840 align:start position:0%
to it then the moderator gives the
 
05:54:58.868 --> 05:54:58.878 align:start position:0%
opportunity and if no one steps forward
 
05:55:00.070 --> 05:55:00.080 align:start position:0%
then you move on they had the
 
05:55:02.390 --> 05:55:02.400 align:start position:0%
opportunity okay that's all thank you
 
05:55:05.310 --> 05:55:05.320 align:start position:0%
any other questions represent rwood
 
05:55:07.628 --> 05:55:07.638 align:start position:0%
thank you m Mr Vice chairman and thank
 
05:55:10.070 --> 05:55:10.080 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question do you think
 
05:55:12.708 --> 05:55:12.718 align:start position:0%
it's about time that we
 
05:55:16.590 --> 05:55:16.600 align:start position:0%
start delineating between Town meetings
 
05:55:19.030 --> 05:55:19.040 align:start position:0%
and deliberative sessions and use that
 
05:55:20.868 --> 05:55:20.878 align:start position:0%
language in
 
05:55:24.030 --> 05:55:24.040 align:start position:0%
bills so there's no
 
05:55:27.070 --> 05:55:27.080 align:start position:0%
confusion because I I know that arriving
 
05:55:29.948 --> 05:55:29.958 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire I had no clue what was
 
05:55:34.510 --> 05:55:34.520 align:start position:0%
going on and I found the
 
05:55:37.708 --> 05:55:37.718 align:start position:0%
language confusing
 
05:55:37.718 --> 05:55:38.868 align:start position:0%
language confusing
um

05:55:38.868 --> 05:55:38.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:55:41.910 --> 05:55:41.920 align:start position:0%
and I think for the average
 
05:55:44.190 --> 05:55:44.200 align:start position:0%
citizen they don't even know what a
 
05:55:47.430 --> 05:55:47.440 align:start position:0%
deliberative session is and if we start
 
05:55:52.270 --> 05:55:52.280 align:start position:0%
using that language in our um statutes
 
05:55:57.190 --> 05:55:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:00.670 --> 05:56:00.680 align:start position:0%
um would you be do you see any reason
 
05:56:04.150 --> 05:56:04.160 align:start position:0%
why the word deliberative session would
 
05:56:10.390 --> 05:56:10.400 align:start position:0%
not be used here in the um line
 
05:56:12.510 --> 05:56:12.520 align:start position:0%
one thank you for the question I think
 
05:56:17.030 --> 05:56:17.040 align:start position:0%
it's a question um the so there's you
 
05:56:19.270 --> 05:56:19.280 align:start position:0%
have this is welcome to your world here
 
05:56:21.868 --> 05:56:21.878 align:start position:0%
um because you have um you deal with
 
05:56:23.230 --> 05:56:23.240 align:start position:0%
Municipal and County government
 
05:56:24.750 --> 05:56:24.760 align:start position:0%
especially municipal government here
 
05:56:27.910 --> 05:56:27.920 align:start position:0%
which is also school district and we
 
05:56:29.788 --> 05:56:29.798 align:start position:0%
have annual meetings and that's a
 
05:56:32.830 --> 05:56:32.840 align:start position:0%
generic term and under underneath annual
 
05:56:36.990 --> 05:56:37.000 align:start position:0%
meeting we have SP2 and traditional
 
05:56:39.350 --> 05:56:39.360 align:start position:0%
and there are some laws that apply to
 
05:56:42.390 --> 05:56:42.400 align:start position:0%
both equally then there are some that
 
05:56:44.430 --> 05:56:44.440 align:start position:0%
only apply to
 
05:56:46.990 --> 05:56:47.000 align:start position:0%
SP2 which we've heard some today and
 
05:56:48.310 --> 05:56:48.320 align:start position:0%
there's some that apply only to
 
05:56:50.430 --> 05:56:50.440 align:start position:0%
traditional meetings but in some cases
 
05:56:53.430 --> 05:56:53.440 align:start position:0%
there the law applies to both and you
 
05:56:55.390 --> 05:56:55.400 align:start position:0%
have to know what once you get to when
 
05:56:57.110 --> 05:56:57.120 align:start position:0%
you say annual meeting that could mean
 
05:56:59.310 --> 05:56:59.320 align:start position:0%
deliberative session that could mean
 
05:57:00.788 --> 05:57:00.798 align:start position:0%
traditional meeting just because the
 
05:57:04.110 --> 05:57:04.120 align:start position:0%
annual meeting generic term means both
 
05:57:07.510 --> 05:57:07.520 align:start position:0%
and fortunately I live in a town that
 
05:57:08.708 --> 05:57:08.718 align:start position:0%
has both
 
05:57:11.628 --> 05:57:11.638 align:start position:0%
systems and I'm familiar with both of
 
05:57:13.590 --> 05:57:13.600 align:start position:0%
them and I've been to them and I
 
05:57:15.230 --> 05:57:15.240 align:start position:0%
understand them deeply but I do know
 
05:57:17.590 --> 05:57:17.600 align:start position:0%
that a lot of citizens don't they come
 
05:57:19.670 --> 05:57:19.680 align:start position:0%
to me with questions and they don't know
 
05:57:23.270 --> 05:57:23.280 align:start position:0%
how things work and um and there's even
 
05:57:25.350 --> 05:57:25.360 align:start position:0%
state representatives that don't
 
05:57:27.390 --> 05:57:27.400 align:start position:0%
understand that I think that when they
 
05:57:29.750 --> 05:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
write a bill they only know SP2 and they
 
05:57:31.948 --> 05:57:31.958 align:start position:0%
know nothing about a traditional meeting
 
05:57:33.310 --> 05:57:33.320 align:start position:0%
so and I think you probably have seen
 
05:57:34.750 --> 05:57:34.760 align:start position:0%
some of those bills in your committee
 
05:57:37.510 --> 05:57:37.520 align:start position:0%
and I've read some of them so I think it
 
05:57:39.230 --> 05:57:39.240 align:start position:0%
where it makes sense you definitely need
 
05:57:41.548 --> 05:57:41.558 align:start position:0%
to delineate you know whether you have a
 
05:57:44.548 --> 05:57:44.558 align:start position:0%
deliberative session whether it's SP2
 
05:57:47.270 --> 05:57:47.280 align:start position:0%
whether it's uh an annual meeting or it
 
05:57:49.390 --> 05:57:49.400 align:start position:0%
sort of applies generically and I think
 
05:57:50.548 --> 05:57:50.558 align:start position:0%
in this case this one applies
 
05:57:52.150 --> 05:57:52.160 align:start position:0%
generically so I don't think it needs to
 
05:57:54.708 --> 05:57:54.718 align:start position:0%
be updated because it's it's it's just
 
05:57:58.070 --> 05:57:58.080 align:start position:0%
modifying the three statutes right here
 
05:57:59.468 --> 05:57:59.478 align:start position:0%
you know when you have a town and we
 
05:58:01.150 --> 05:58:01.160 align:start position:0%
also have the dimension of town versus
 
05:58:04.510 --> 05:58:04.520 align:start position:0%
school district and in for petition warn
 
05:58:07.750 --> 05:58:07.760 align:start position:0%
articles for special and and um annual
 
05:58:09.788 --> 05:58:09.798 align:start position:0%
meetings it's RSA
 
05:58:12.430 --> 05:58:12.440 align:start position:0%
393 but for the wisdom of the general
 
05:58:14.190 --> 05:58:14.200 align:start position:0%
court they broke out for school
 
05:58:16.750 --> 05:58:16.760 align:start position:0%
districts it's RSA
 
05:58:19.670 --> 05:58:19.680 align:start position:0%
1976 for annual meetings but they have a
 
05:58:21.590 --> 05:58:21.600 align:start position:0%
separate RSA for special meetings for
 
05:58:24.510 --> 05:58:24.520 align:start position:0%
petition War go 1972 so that's the way
 
05:58:26.510 --> 05:58:26.520 align:start position:0%
it works it just have to that's the way
 
05:58:28.750 --> 05:58:28.760 align:start position:0%
it is um so that's why this bill has
 
05:58:30.270 --> 05:58:30.280 align:start position:0%
those three sections because the town is
 
05:58:32.190 --> 05:58:32.200 align:start position:0%
covered by one the school district needs
 
05:58:35.150 --> 05:58:35.160 align:start position:0%
to be covered by both cases so you have
 
05:58:36.390 --> 05:58:36.400 align:start position:0%
a lot of different dimension it's a
 
05:58:36.400 --> 05:58:38.948 align:start position:0%
a lot of different dimension it's a
multi-dimensional

05:58:38.948 --> 05:58:38.958 align:start position:0%
multi-dimensional
 
05:58:42.150 --> 05:58:42.160 align:start position:0%
problem any other

05:59:05.190 --> 05:59:05.200 align:start position:0%
Association good afternoon my name is
 
05:59:07.190 --> 05:59:07.200 align:start position:0%
Sarah bur Cohen I represent the New
 
05:59:09.510 --> 05:59:09.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Municipal Association the New
 
05:59:11.390 --> 05:59:11.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Municipal Association opposes
 
05:59:13.708 --> 05:59:13.718 align:start position:0%
this bill this bill is Impractical and
 
05:59:15.230 --> 05:59:15.240 align:start position:0%
treats petition warrant articles
 
05:59:18.628 --> 05:59:18.638 align:start position:0%
differently this dis this bill describes
 
05:59:21.310 --> 05:59:21.320 align:start position:0%
the appointment of a primary petitioner
 
05:59:23.230 --> 05:59:23.240 align:start position:0%
currently any petitioner may speak to
 
05:59:25.270 --> 05:59:25.280 align:start position:0%
the petitioned warrant article does not
 
05:59:27.468 --> 05:59:27.478 align:start position:0%
seem necessary to have legislation to
 
05:59:29.270 --> 05:59:29.280 align:start position:0%
appoint a primary petitioner when this
 
05:59:31.350 --> 05:59:31.360 align:start position:0%
seems to happen organically during the
 
05:59:33.390 --> 05:59:33.400 align:start position:0%
petitioned warrant article process and
 
05:59:33.400 --> 05:59:34.590 align:start position:0%
petitioned warrant article process and
application

05:59:34.590 --> 05:59:34.600 align:start position:0%
application
 
05:59:37.468 --> 05:59:37.478 align:start position:0%
process this requires the moderator to
 
05:59:39.590 --> 05:59:39.600 align:start position:0%
allow the primary petitioner to
 
05:59:41.310 --> 05:59:41.320 align:start position:0%
introduce their petitioned warrant
 
05:59:43.910 --> 05:59:43.920 align:start position:0%
article at the meeting introduce is a
 
05:59:46.310 --> 05:59:46.320 align:start position:0%
vague and undefined term in the bill
 
05:59:48.310 --> 05:59:48.320 align:start position:0%
that would create confusion is it a
 
05:59:50.350 --> 05:59:50.360 align:start position:0%
presentation is it merely reading the
 
05:59:52.708 --> 05:59:52.718 align:start position:0%
article is it something
 
05:59:56.030 --> 05:59:56.040 align:start position:0%
else page 2 lines 24 through3 read the
 
05:59:57.750 --> 05:59:57.760 align:start position:0%
primary petitioner shall be given the
 
05:59:59.628 --> 05:59:59.638 align:start position:0%
same amount of time equal to the longest
 
06:00:01.230 --> 06:00:01.240 align:start position:0%
amount of time granted to the governing
 
06:00:03.310 --> 06:00:03.320 align:start position:0%
body or budget committee to introduce
 
06:00:06.310 --> 06:00:06.320 align:start position:0%
any War warrant article at the meeting
 
06:00:09.030 --> 06:00:09.040 align:start position:0%
this language would require moderators
 
06:00:11.708 --> 06:00:11.718 align:start position:0%
to pull out their stopwatch for every
 
06:00:13.510 --> 06:00:13.520 align:start position:0%
presentation by the governing body or
 
06:00:16.150 --> 06:00:16.160 align:start position:0%
budget committee tally the time and then
 
06:00:18.150 --> 06:00:18.160 align:start position:0%
determine the longest amount of the of
 
06:00:19.750 --> 06:00:19.760 align:start position:0%
time granted to the governing body or
 
06:00:21.788 --> 06:00:21.798 align:start position:0%
committee which would obviously change
 
06:00:23.390 --> 06:00:23.400 align:start position:0%
throughout the meeting and then grant
 
06:00:27.030 --> 06:00:27.040 align:start position:0%
that to this primary uh to the primary
 
06:00:29.948 --> 06:00:29.958 align:start position:0%
um petitioner of the petitioned warrant
 
06:00:31.990 --> 06:00:32.000 align:start position:0%
article it puts petition warrant
 
06:00:33.948 --> 06:00:33.958 align:start position:0%
articles in a separate category than any
 
06:00:35.350 --> 06:00:35.360 align:start position:0%
other warrant article and doesn't
 
06:00:37.628 --> 06:00:37.638 align:start position:0%
consider that some warrant articles like
 
06:00:39.788 --> 06:00:39.798 align:start position:0%
the budget or Lodge bond issue Bond
 
06:00:42.510 --> 06:00:42.520 align:start position:0%
project bonded project may need to be
 
06:00:44.628 --> 06:00:44.638 align:start position:0%
may need a more extended presentation
 
06:00:46.390 --> 06:00:46.400 align:start position:0%
that voters want to hear so they can
 
06:00:48.190 --> 06:00:48.200 align:start position:0%
make an informed decision about the
 
06:00:51.628 --> 06:00:51.638 align:start position:0%
complex issues in essence this means all
 
06:00:53.468 --> 06:00:53.478 align:start position:0%
PCI petitioned warrant articles would be
 
06:00:55.150 --> 06:00:55.160 align:start position:0%
required to have the longest amount of
 
06:00:56.750 --> 06:00:56.760 align:start position:0%
time granted to the governing body or
 
06:00:59.670 --> 06:00:59.680 align:start position:0%
budget committee if this time is an hour
 
06:01:01.990 --> 06:01:02.000 align:start position:0%
then each primary petitioner on a
 
06:01:03.708 --> 06:01:03.718 align:start position:0%
petitioned warrant article would have
 
06:01:06.590 --> 06:01:06.600 align:start position:0%
one hour to introduce
 
06:01:08.590 --> 06:01:08.600 align:start position:0%
their article if there are five
 
06:01:10.670 --> 06:01:10.680 align:start position:0%
petitioned warrant articles this could
 
06:01:12.670 --> 06:01:12.680 align:start position:0%
be five hours what if there are more
 
06:01:14.430 --> 06:01:14.440 align:start position:0%
than five petition warrant articles at
 
06:01:17.110 --> 06:01:17.120 align:start position:0%
the meeting this could add significant
 
06:01:21.030 --> 06:01:21.040 align:start position:0%
time onto annual or or special meetings
 
06:01:22.830 --> 06:01:22.840 align:start position:0%
it could allow one person to hold the
 
06:01:25.430 --> 06:01:25.440 align:start position:0%
entire legislative body captive during
 
06:01:27.230 --> 06:01:27.240 align:start position:0%
an introduction essentially it could
 
06:01:29.030 --> 06:01:29.040 align:start position:0%
allow one person to fill a buster at the
 
06:01:32.070 --> 06:01:32.080 align:start position:0%
town meeting the legislative um what
 
06:01:33.510 --> 06:01:33.520 align:start position:0%
does this bill mean in terms of the
 
06:01:36.150 --> 06:01:36.160 align:start position:0%
ability of the legislative body it
 
06:01:37.990 --> 06:01:38.000 align:start position:0%
should be the legislative body that Li
 
06:01:39.868 --> 06:01:39.878 align:start position:0%
sets limits on how long people speak or
 
06:01:41.910 --> 06:01:41.920 align:start position:0%
ask questions and be able to vote to
 
06:01:44.868 --> 06:01:44.878 align:start position:0%
facilitate voter votes on warrant
 
06:01:47.350 --> 06:01:47.360 align:start position:0%
articles this bill would give one person
 
06:01:49.150 --> 06:01:49.160 align:start position:0%
the ability to hold captive the
 
06:01:52.150 --> 06:01:52.160 align:start position:0%
legislative body to hear information
 
06:01:54.628 --> 06:01:54.638 align:start position:0%
that they may not find necessary to to
 
06:01:56.990 --> 06:01:57.000 align:start position:0%
hear or vote to to to vote on the
 
06:01:59.230 --> 06:01:59.240 align:start position:0%
petition warrant
 
06:02:01.708 --> 06:02:01.718 align:start position:0%
article in addition as the legislative
 
06:02:03.390 --> 06:02:03.400 align:start position:0%
body can set limits on how long people
 
06:02:05.868 --> 06:02:05.878 align:start position:0%
can speak the legislative body can also
 
06:02:07.310 --> 06:02:07.320 align:start position:0%
overrule the moderator and allow the
 
06:02:09.110 --> 06:02:09.120 align:start position:0%
petitioner to speak longer if the
 
06:02:11.468 --> 06:02:11.478 align:start position:0%
legislative body finds it necessary or
 
06:02:14.270 --> 06:02:14.280 align:start position:0%
needed Additionally the legislative body
 
06:02:16.350 --> 06:02:16.360 align:start position:0%
cannot table petition Warren articles if
 
06:02:18.948 --> 06:02:18.958 align:start position:0%
they want to proceed and and hear
 
06:02:21.868 --> 06:02:21.878 align:start position:0%
them the bill this bill seemingly takes
 
06:02:23.510 --> 06:02:23.520 align:start position:0%
that power away from the legislative
 
06:02:25.830 --> 06:02:25.840 align:start position:0%
body and instead grants it to this
 
06:02:28.430 --> 06:02:28.440 align:start position:0%
primary petitioner of uh a petitioned
 
06:02:31.310 --> 06:02:31.320 align:start position:0%
warrant article nhma opposes this bill
 
06:02:33.510 --> 06:02:33.520 align:start position:0%
and urges you to do likewise I will I'm
 
06:02:34.830 --> 06:02:34.840 align:start position:0%
open for
 
06:02:38.190 --> 06:02:38.200 align:start position:0%
questions any questions from the
 
06:02:41.430 --> 06:02:41.440 align:start position:0%
committee representative award thank you
 
06:02:44.110 --> 06:02:44.120 align:start position:0%
Mr Vice chair thank you for taking my
 
06:02:48.190 --> 06:02:48.200 align:start position:0%
question um out of curiosity how what is
 
06:02:50.270 --> 06:02:50.280 align:start position:0%
the process for the legislative body
 
06:02:54.468 --> 06:02:54.478 align:start position:0%
setting limits on on the time the people
 
06:02:57.830 --> 06:02:57.840 align:start position:0%
can speak how does the legislative body
 
06:03:01.670 --> 06:03:01.680 align:start position:0%
do that well the legislative body so the
 
06:03:04.030 --> 06:03:04.040 align:start position:0%
moderator is the facilitator of the
 
06:03:06.150 --> 06:03:06.160 align:start position:0%
meeting the legislative body certainly
 
06:03:09.750 --> 06:03:09.760 align:start position:0%
can set limits on on debate by calling
 
06:03:13.750 --> 06:03:13.760 align:start position:0%
the question or as I as I understand
 
06:03:15.670 --> 06:03:15.680 align:start position:0%
setting limits further on in the meeting
 
06:03:17.150 --> 06:03:17.160 align:start position:0%
so if the meeting goes on for a while
 
06:03:20.230 --> 06:03:20.240 align:start position:0%
setting limits on the debate amount of
 
06:03:22.310 --> 06:03:22.320 align:start position:0%
debate follow up
 
06:03:25.628 --> 06:03:25.638 align:start position:0%
sir yes go ahead so someone in the
 
06:03:28.708 --> 06:03:28.718 align:start position:0%
legislative body can make a motion to
 
06:03:32.350 --> 06:03:32.360 align:start position:0%
set a limit on the time that speakers
 
06:03:36.270 --> 06:03:36.280 align:start position:0%
can speak correct correct okay thank you
 
06:03:38.430 --> 06:03:38.440 align:start position:0%
any other
 
06:03:42.910 --> 06:03:42.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:01.548 --> 06:04:01.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:04.548 --> 06:04:04.558 align:start position:0%
trelli sorry Joe terrelli from Hampton
 
06:04:06.350 --> 06:04:06.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
06:04:09.708 --> 06:04:09.718 align:start position:0%
um I rise in favor of this bill I have
 
06:04:11.670 --> 06:04:11.680 align:start position:0%
been subject to a couple of
 
06:04:14.990 --> 06:04:15.000 align:start position:0%
interesting events at the deliberative
 
06:04:18.430 --> 06:04:18.440 align:start position:0%
session uh one of the first things that
 
06:04:21.990 --> 06:04:22.000 align:start position:0%
I uh wanted to mention representative
 
06:04:24.548 --> 06:04:24.558 align:start position:0%
award said the town meeting versus Del
 
06:04:27.350 --> 06:04:27.360 align:start position:0%
liberative session versus the election
 
06:04:28.868 --> 06:04:28.878 align:start position:0%
these are all very confusing to people
 
06:04:30.750 --> 06:04:30.760 align:start position:0%
that are just arriving and it took me a
 
06:04:33.230 --> 06:04:33.240 align:start position:0%
year to understand how amazingly
 
06:04:36.190 --> 06:04:36.200 align:start position:0%
important the deliberative session is
 
06:04:39.750 --> 06:04:39.760 align:start position:0%
but I now when I first take the floor
 
06:04:42.310 --> 06:04:42.320 align:start position:0%
microphone I welcome everyone to the
 
06:04:45.390 --> 06:04:45.400 align:start position:0%
town marketing event this is where the
 
06:04:48.670 --> 06:04:48.680 align:start position:0%
town has chosen where the town wants to
 
06:04:51.230 --> 06:04:51.240 align:start position:0%
spend the money and they get to do all
 
06:04:54.830 --> 06:04:54.840 align:start position:0%
of their presentations with slides and
 
06:04:57.270 --> 06:04:57.280 align:start position:0%
with all kinds of PowerPoint and
 
06:04:59.468 --> 06:04:59.478 align:start position:0%
pictures some do it better than others I
 
06:05:00.990 --> 06:05:01.000 align:start position:0%
complained the first year and then they
 
06:05:02.270 --> 06:05:02.280 align:start position:0%
finally got their act together and
 
06:05:03.628 --> 06:05:03.638 align:start position:0%
started doing a little bit better job I
 
06:05:05.230 --> 06:05:05.240 align:start position:0%
worked at Apple for a long time so I
 
06:05:07.910 --> 06:05:07.920 align:start position:0%
kind of have idea about
 
06:05:11.670 --> 06:05:11.680 align:start position:0%
marketing why wouldn't a petition Ward
 
06:05:14.670 --> 06:05:14.680 align:start position:0%
article sponsor want to be able to do a
 
06:05:17.270 --> 06:05:17.280 align:start position:0%
presentation on the screen something
 
06:05:19.350 --> 06:05:19.360 align:start position:0%
visual something that's very clear
 
06:05:22.628 --> 06:05:22.638 align:start position:0%
something that's understandable so I
 
06:05:24.990 --> 06:05:25.000 align:start position:0%
like this a lot I think it's a really
 
06:05:26.990 --> 06:05:27.000 align:start position:0%
great idea I think we should call it the
 
06:05:29.310 --> 06:05:29.320 align:start position:0%
town marketing event because they're
 
06:05:31.190 --> 06:05:31.200 align:start position:0%
asking for lots and lots and lots of
 
06:05:34.310 --> 06:05:34.320 align:start position:0%
money for this and for that and here's
 
06:05:36.548 --> 06:05:36.558 align:start position:0%
the default versus here's the the other
 
06:05:39.190 --> 06:05:39.200 align:start position:0%
versus the proposed so I'm in favor of
 
06:05:41.788 --> 06:05:41.798 align:start position:0%
this thank
 
06:05:44.270 --> 06:05:44.280 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr Terell any questions
 
06:05:46.190 --> 06:05:46.200 align:start position:0%
from the
 
06:05:48.468 --> 06:05:48.478 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
06:05:51.990 --> 06:05:52.000 align:start position:0%
Frank thank you Mr Vice chair thank you
 
06:05:53.468 --> 06:05:53.478 align:start position:0%
for taking my
 
06:05:57.070 --> 06:05:57.080 align:start position:0%
question uh is there anything that would
 
06:06:00.510 --> 06:06:00.520 align:start position:0%
prohibit a Town's person from putting
 
06:06:04.190 --> 06:06:04.200 align:start position:0%
together a PowerPoint deck and showing
 
06:06:07.230 --> 06:06:07.240 align:start position:0%

her
 
06:06:10.910 --> 06:06:10.920 align:start position:0%
introduction that's a great question I
 
06:06:12.590 --> 06:06:12.600 align:start position:0%
appreciate it because when I spoke to
 
06:06:15.548 --> 06:06:15.558 align:start position:0%
the moderator two years ago when I was
 
06:06:19.910 --> 06:06:19.920 align:start position:0%
creating on my iPad the value of the
 
06:06:22.750 --> 06:06:22.760 align:start position:0%
$400,000 after every one of the spending
 
06:06:24.510 --> 06:06:24.520 align:start position:0%
articles so that I could hold it up in
 
06:06:27.230 --> 06:06:27.240 align:start position:0%
front of the camera it's absolutely a
 
06:06:29.708 --> 06:06:29.718 align:start position:0%
great idea to do a PowerPoint but I
 
06:06:31.548 --> 06:06:31.558 align:start position:0%
really recommend that there be some sort
 
06:06:33.990 --> 06:06:34.000 align:start position:0%
of a the moderator needs to review what
 
06:06:36.788 --> 06:06:36.798 align:start position:0%
the presentation is ahead of time
 
06:06:37.948 --> 06:06:37.958 align:start position:0%
because you don't know what's going to
 
06:06:39.468 --> 06:06:39.478 align:start position:0%
end up being there and that's I don't
 
06:06:41.468 --> 06:06:41.478 align:start position:0%
have a problem with that whatsoever it's
 
06:06:43.868 --> 06:06:43.878 align:start position:0%
kind of like staging an event somebody
 
06:06:45.590 --> 06:06:45.600 align:start position:0%
needs to clarify it and make sure that
 
06:06:48.390 --> 06:06:48.400 align:start position:0%
it's okay and the moderator being in
 
06:06:51.190 --> 06:06:51.200 align:start position:0%
charge of the marketing event I wouldn't
 
06:06:53.990 --> 06:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
have a problem with that at all
 
06:06:57.590 --> 06:06:57.600 align:start position:0%
followup yes follow up um my question
 
06:06:59.230 --> 06:06:59.240 align:start position:0%
was is there anything that would
 
06:07:02.390 --> 06:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
prohibit that to your knowledge to my
 
06:07:04.910 --> 06:07:04.920 align:start position:0%
knowledge no it's just it could be even
 
06:07:06.350 --> 06:07:06.360 align:start position:0%
a range
 
06:07:11.190 --> 06:07:11.200 align:start position:0%
in the background but I think if it was
 
06:07:14.750 --> 06:07:14.760 align:start position:0%
available by law that would be a really
 
06:07:16.670 --> 06:07:16.680 align:start position:0%
great thing to enhance this and I think
 
06:07:18.468 --> 06:07:18.478 align:start position:0%
we need to get as many people out to
 
06:07:20.390 --> 06:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
deliberative session or marketing event
 
06:07:24.390 --> 06:07:24.400 align:start position:0%
as possible because it is the mechanism
 
06:07:26.350 --> 06:07:26.360 align:start position:0%
and it took I'm sorry I missed the first
 
06:07:29.468 --> 06:07:29.478 align:start position:0%
year but oh my gosh this is the single
 
06:07:31.430 --> 06:07:31.440 align:start position:0%
most important mechanism for we as the
 
06:07:34.150 --> 06:07:34.160 align:start position:0%
people to be able to help understand and
 
06:07:36.990 --> 06:07:37.000 align:start position:0%
after the revaluation
 
06:07:38.948 --> 06:07:38.958 align:start position:0%
everybody started paying more attention
 
06:07:41.868 --> 06:07:41.878 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden and so there's a lot of
 
06:07:43.390 --> 06:07:43.400 align:start position:0%
people that have gathered together that
 
06:07:46.110 --> 06:07:46.120 align:start position:0%
are now friendly and discussing things
 
06:07:49.670 --> 06:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
on how can we effectively make our lives
 
06:07:51.430 --> 06:07:51.440 align:start position:0%
a little easier instead of more
 
06:07:54.070 --> 06:07:54.080 align:start position:0%
difficult thank
 
06:07:57.190 --> 06:07:57.200 align:start position:0%
you any other further
 
06:07:59.230 --> 06:07:59.240 align:start position:0%
questions I seeing none thank you for
 
06:08:01.270 --> 06:08:01.280 align:start position:0%

District
 
06:11:20.030 --> 06:11:20.040 align:start position:0%
36 under current law municipalities
 
06:11:22.708 --> 06:11:22.718 align:start position:0%
through its planning boards May assess
 
06:11:25.868 --> 06:11:25.878 align:start position:0%
impact fees on new development or
 
06:11:28.270 --> 06:11:28.280 align:start position:0%
construction that is driving the need
 
06:11:30.910 --> 06:11:30.920 align:start position:0%
for a new or expanded Municipal
 
06:11:33.230 --> 06:11:33.240 align:start position:0%
facilities impact fees enable
 
06:11:35.548 --> 06:11:35.558 align:start position:0%
municipalities to help to be able ble to
 
06:11:38.468 --> 06:11:38.478 align:start position:0%
recover some of the costs for these
 
06:11:41.548 --> 06:11:41.558 align:start position:0%
Municipal facilities necessitated by the
 
06:11:45.590 --> 06:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
growth due to the um construction or
 
06:11:48.628 --> 06:11:48.638 align:start position:0%
development so this provision is under
 
06:11:54.628 --> 06:11:54.638 align:start position:0%
RSA 674 colon 21 Roman numeral 5 a
 
06:11:57.868 --> 06:11:57.878 align:start position:0%
through L and it falls under Innovative
 
06:12:01.230 --> 06:12:01.240 align:start position:0%
land use controls and they prescribe
 
06:12:04.350 --> 06:12:04.360 align:start position:0%
methods for computing the impact fees
 
06:12:06.590 --> 06:12:06.600 align:start position:0%
and planning board also work with
 
06:12:09.628 --> 06:12:09.638 align:start position:0%
regional planning commissions to ensure
 
06:12:12.430 --> 06:12:12.440 align:start position:0%
compliance with regards to the impact
 
06:12:16.468 --> 06:12:16.478 align:start position:0%
fee um calculations impact fees are
 
06:12:19.190 --> 06:12:19.200 align:start position:0%
collected to help share the cost of
 
06:12:22.510 --> 06:12:22.520 align:start position:0%
Municipal facilities with both current
 
06:12:25.270 --> 06:12:25.280 align:start position:0%
and new property owners and it's
 
06:12:28.590 --> 06:12:28.600 align:start position:0%
amortized over the life of the
 
06:12:31.548 --> 06:12:31.558 align:start position:0%
facilities currently there are 21
 
06:12:35.310 --> 06:12:35.320 align:start position:0%
eligible Capital facility purposes spe
 
06:12:38.948 --> 06:12:38.958 align:start position:0%
ified in RSA for which an impact fee may
 
06:12:41.510 --> 06:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
be assessed and this includes such
 
06:12:44.628 --> 06:12:44.638 align:start position:0%
things as public water and sewer storm
 
06:12:47.788 --> 06:12:47.798 align:start position:0%
water public roads municipal offices
 
06:12:51.270 --> 06:12:51.280 align:start position:0%
Public Schools public safety Solid Waste
 
06:12:53.390 --> 06:12:53.400 align:start position:0%
public libraries and
 
06:12:56.110 --> 06:12:56.120 align:start position:0%
Recreation however the list does not in
 
06:12:59.070 --> 06:12:59.080 align:start position:0%
currently include Public Works
 
06:13:01.868 --> 06:13:01.878 align:start position:0%
facilities which appears to be an
 
06:13:04.590 --> 06:13:04.600 align:start position:0%
oversight so the solution is a spill
 
06:13:08.150 --> 06:13:08.160 align:start position:0%
before you House Bill 168 corrects this
 
06:13:11.590 --> 06:13:11.600 align:start position:0%
oversight by simply adding Public Works
 
06:13:13.670 --> 06:13:13.680 align:start position:0%
facilities to the current list of
 
06:13:16.590 --> 06:13:16.600 align:start position:0%
eligible Capital facilities for the
 
06:13:20.110 --> 06:13:20.120 align:start position:0%
assessment of impact fees in the past 5
 
06:13:23.390 --> 06:13:23.400 align:start position:0%
years there are at um at least five
 
06:13:25.948 --> 06:13:25.958 align:start position:0%
municipalities that I've been able to
 
06:13:28.510 --> 06:13:28.520 align:start position:0%
identify that have constructed new
 
06:13:30.910 --> 06:13:30.920 align:start position:0%
Public Works facilities but they
 
06:13:33.910 --> 06:13:33.920 align:start position:0%
unfortunately cannot collect impact fees
 
06:13:37.030 --> 06:13:37.040 align:start position:0%
because it's not included in the list um
 
06:13:39.628 --> 06:13:39.638 align:start position:0%
these municipalities include nashaa
 
06:13:43.070 --> 06:13:43.080 align:start position:0%
Hollis Brookline Rochester and Groton
 
06:13:45.750 --> 06:13:45.760 align:start position:0%
and additionally uh sixth municipality
 
06:13:48.788 --> 06:13:48.798 align:start position:0%
was recently identified and that was
 
06:13:53.310 --> 06:13:53.320 align:start position:0%
Guilford they have a um $1.2 million
 
06:13:57.030 --> 06:13:57.040 align:start position:0%
bond for a new Public Works facility on
 
06:13:59.910 --> 06:13:59.920 align:start position:0%
their March 11th ballot which will be
 
06:14:02.548 --> 06:14:02.558 align:start position:0%
held in a couple of weeks the addition
 
06:14:04.468 --> 06:14:04.478 align:start position:0%
of Public Works facilities to the
 
06:14:06.990 --> 06:14:07.000 align:start position:0%
current list of eligible Capital
 
06:14:10.708 --> 06:14:10.718 align:start position:0%
facilities is both fair and reasonable
 
06:14:12.548 --> 06:14:12.558 align:start position:0%
therefore I urge this committee to
 
06:14:16.510 --> 06:14:16.520 align:start position:0%
recommend ought to pass on House Bill
 
06:14:19.350 --> 06:14:19.360 align:start position:0%
168 that concludes my bill introduction
 
06:14:22.150 --> 06:14:22.160 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to answer any
 
06:14:29.070 --> 06:14:29.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:31.670 --> 06:14:31.680 align:start position:0%
committee I just have one uh quick run
 
06:14:33.910 --> 06:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
representative yep what's the basic
 
06:14:42.310 --> 06:14:42.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:46.150 --> 06:14:46.160 align:start position:0%
different so um the definition is in
 
06:14:48.548 --> 06:14:48.558 align:start position:0%
statute and it says impact fee means a
 
06:14:50.390 --> 06:14:50.400 align:start position:0%
fee or assessment imposed upon
 
06:14:52.110 --> 06:14:52.120 align:start position:0%
development including
 
06:14:54.310 --> 06:14:54.320 align:start position:0%
subdivision building construction or
 
06:14:56.070 --> 06:14:56.080 align:start position:0%
other land use change in order to help
 
06:14:57.708 --> 06:14:57.718 align:start position:0%
meet the needs occasioned by that
 
06:14:59.110 --> 06:14:59.120 align:start position:0%
development for the construction or
 
06:15:00.910 --> 06:15:00.920 align:start position:0%
Improvement of capital facilities owned
 
06:15:04.310 --> 06:15:04.320 align:start position:0%
or operated by it's it's in the statute
 
06:15:06.430 --> 06:15:06.440 align:start position:0%
already I I don't I don't really need
 
06:15:08.350 --> 06:15:08.360 align:start position:0%
probably need to continue to read that
 
06:15:09.830 --> 06:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
unless you want me to no that's fine I
 
06:15:11.990 --> 06:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
was just trying to get a general
 
06:15:14.510 --> 06:15:14.520 align:start position:0%
definition how would it work on a public
 
06:15:17.590 --> 06:15:17.600 align:start position:0%
works facility does the town say you ow
 
06:15:21.990 --> 06:15:22.000 align:start position:0%
us who pays for that or whatever I guess
 
06:15:24.510 --> 06:15:24.520 align:start position:0%
so if I understand your question we
 
06:15:26.510 --> 06:15:26.520 align:start position:0%
already have impact fees and we already
 
06:15:29.150 --> 06:15:29.160 align:start position:0%
have 21 purposes for which impact fees
 
06:15:31.910 --> 06:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
may be assessed and so clearly Public
 
06:15:34.590 --> 06:15:34.600 align:start position:0%
Works facilities you know or commonly
 
06:15:37.910 --> 06:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
known as DPW facilities that's the
 
06:15:40.430 --> 06:15:40.440 align:start position:0%
municipal um facility that that I'm
 
06:15:43.070 --> 06:15:43.080 align:start position:0%
referencing with regards to this
 
06:15:47.510 --> 06:15:47.520 align:start position:0%
particular bill it seems to be in an
 
06:15:50.990 --> 06:15:51.000 align:start position:0%
obvious um
 
06:15:54.788 --> 06:15:54.798 align:start position:0%
Municipal uh purpose or facility within
 
06:15:57.670 --> 06:15:57.680 align:start position:0%
a town and it's not on the list for some
 
06:16:00.990 --> 06:16:01.000 align:start position:0%
reason as a list has evolved over time I
 
06:16:03.468 --> 06:16:03.478 align:start position:0%
hope that answers your
 
06:16:06.190 --> 06:16:06.200 align:start position:0%
question so in the budget they would
 
06:16:07.788 --> 06:16:07.798 align:start position:0%
have a certain amount of money paid to
 
06:16:10.868 --> 06:16:10.878 align:start position:0%
the town from the taxpayers we the only
 
06:16:12.990 --> 06:16:13.000 align:start position:0%
time if I can just say we use impact
 
06:16:15.150 --> 06:16:15.160 align:start position:0%
fees if there's a Development coming in
 
06:16:16.548 --> 06:16:16.558 align:start position:0%
then they pay a certain amount of money
 
06:16:19.030 --> 06:16:19.040 align:start position:0%
for each lot to develop it I I don't
 
06:16:21.390 --> 06:16:21.400 align:start position:0%
think we've ever used this on any any
 
06:16:25.788 --> 06:16:25.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:29.310 --> 06:16:29.320 align:start position:0%
owns again if I understand your question
 
06:16:31.430 --> 06:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
what I'm hearing is that in your
 
06:16:34.350 --> 06:16:34.360 align:start position:0%
particular um municipality you don't
 
06:16:39.190 --> 06:16:39.200 align:start position:0%
assess impact fees it's it's optional
 
06:16:42.110 --> 06:16:42.120 align:start position:0%
it your planning board can go and and
 
06:16:44.750 --> 06:16:44.760 align:start position:0%
look into it and it's a it's a zoning
 
06:16:46.990 --> 06:16:47.000 align:start position:0%
ordinance is my understanding in order
 
06:16:50.350 --> 06:16:50.360 align:start position:0%
to be able to assess it okay thank you
 
06:16:52.310 --> 06:16:52.320 align:start position:0%
uh any other
 
06:16:55.990 --> 06:16:56.000 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative thank
 
06:16:59.270 --> 06:16:59.280 align:start position:0%
you okay that was the last uh Pink Cod
 
06:17:02.910 --> 06:17:02.920 align:start position:0%
we have on this bill HB 168 does anyone
 
06:17:08.430 --> 06:17:08.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:15.310 --> 06:17:15.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:18.948 --> 06:17:18.958 align:start position:0%
power thank you Mr Vice chair um I think
 
06:17:21.430 --> 06:17:21.440 align:start position:0%
I did put a pink card in but that's okay
 
06:17:24.510 --> 06:17:24.520 align:start position:0%
um for the record my name is Eric power
 
06:17:27.548 --> 06:17:27.558 align:start position:0%
I'm from Brookline representing myself
 
06:17:31.590 --> 06:17:31.600 align:start position:0%
and also in favor of HB 168 as I
 
06:17:33.590 --> 06:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
mentioned previously I've been serving
 
06:17:36.350 --> 06:17:36.360 align:start position:0%
on the planning board since
 
06:17:41.548 --> 06:17:41.558 align:start position:0%
2021 and impact fees are proposed by the
 
06:17:44.390 --> 06:17:44.400 align:start position:0%
planning board in each Town um the
 
06:17:48.110 --> 06:17:48.120 align:start position:0%
planning board proposes them and they're
 
06:17:51.390 --> 06:17:51.400 align:start position:0%
adopted like any other zoning Amendment
 
06:17:53.350 --> 06:17:53.360 align:start position:0%
um they go through the public hearing
 
06:17:55.868 --> 06:17:55.878 align:start position:0%
process and then they go on the official
 
06:17:58.270 --> 06:17:58.280 align:start position:0%
ballot on Election Day for adoption by
 
06:18:00.948 --> 06:18:00.958 align:start position:0%
voters so the impact fees or the basic
 
06:18:04.110 --> 06:18:04.120 align:start position:0%
idea of an impact fee is to help with
 
06:18:05.270 --> 06:18:05.280 align:start position:0%
new house
 
06:18:08.390 --> 06:18:08.400 align:start position:0%
new commercial properties subdivisions
 
06:18:12.390 --> 06:18:12.400 align:start position:0%
to share a little bit of the cost of the
 
06:18:14.110 --> 06:18:14.120 align:start position:0%
municiple facilities that are being
 
06:18:17.230 --> 06:18:17.240 align:start position:0%
driven by the growth of the town and
 
06:18:18.708 --> 06:18:18.718 align:start position:0%
that's why they have these purposes
 
06:18:21.788 --> 06:18:21.798 align:start position:0%
listed here and you have to keep in mind
 
06:18:24.030 --> 06:18:24.040 align:start position:0%
um there's a lot of subparagraphs that
 
06:18:25.830 --> 06:18:25.840 align:start position:0%
that prescribe how impact fees have to
 
06:18:28.628 --> 06:18:28.638 align:start position:0%
be calculated it's fairly complex I
 
06:18:30.830 --> 06:18:30.840 align:start position:0%
understand it pretty well but the
 
06:18:32.510 --> 06:18:32.520 align:start position:0%
regional planning commissions help us to
 
06:18:34.830 --> 06:18:34.840 align:start position:0%
make sure we're following that the the
 
06:18:37.468 --> 06:18:37.478 align:start position:0%
amateurz and everything of the fees but
 
06:18:40.430 --> 06:18:40.440 align:start position:0%
what it boils down to is a fee gets um
 
06:18:42.110 --> 06:18:42.120 align:start position:0%
when you have a new house they're going
 
06:18:44.350 --> 06:18:44.360 align:start position:0%
to they're going to have a small fee in
 
06:18:48.070 --> 06:18:48.080 align:start position:0%
the few hundred range um based on any of
 
06:18:50.310 --> 06:18:50.320 align:start position:0%
the facilities that are being expanded
 
06:18:52.590 --> 06:18:52.600 align:start position:0%
or a new facilities that are based on
 
06:18:56.230 --> 06:18:56.240 align:start position:0%
the growth in the town it also helps the
 
06:18:58.270 --> 06:18:58.280 align:start position:0%
taxpayers not have to shoulder the
 
06:19:01.110 --> 06:19:01.120 align:start position:0%
burden of all the burden of the new
 
06:19:03.590 --> 06:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
facility and it's shared equitably and
 
06:19:05.510 --> 06:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
there's a whole formula for how that
 
06:19:08.230 --> 06:19:08.240 align:start position:0%
works the problem we have is that this
 
06:19:12.110 --> 06:19:12.120 align:start position:0%
law says um it says the list is
 
06:19:15.708 --> 06:19:15.718 align:start position:0%
including and limited to so it has to be
 
06:19:17.948 --> 06:19:17.958 align:start position:0%
on the list in order for you to collect
 
06:19:19.110 --> 06:19:19.120 align:start position:0%
an impact
 
06:19:23.590 --> 06:19:23.600 align:start position:0%
fee and um you know we had built a new
 
06:19:25.708 --> 06:19:25.718 align:start position:0%
Public Works facilities in Brookline in
 
06:19:28.990 --> 06:19:29.000 align:start position:0%
2022 but we cannot collect impact fees
 
06:19:30.310 --> 06:19:30.320 align:start position:0%
on public work facilities because it's
 
06:19:32.430 --> 06:19:32.440 align:start position:0%
missing in the law and as mentioned
 
06:19:33.990 --> 06:19:34.000 align:start position:0%
earlier our neighbors in Hollis had
 
06:19:37.030 --> 06:19:37.040 align:start position:0%
built one recent Rec l in Nashua
 
06:19:39.910 --> 06:19:39.920 align:start position:0%
Rochester has done one Groton has done
 
06:19:41.868 --> 06:19:41.878 align:start position:0%
one and Guilford looks like they're
 
06:19:45.030 --> 06:19:45.040 align:start position:0%
going to do one so there's at least six
 
06:19:46.910 --> 06:19:46.920 align:start position:0%
municipalities that we're that I'm aware
 
06:19:49.708 --> 06:19:49.718 align:start position:0%
of that may have be be able to do the
 
06:19:52.070 --> 06:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
impact fees it's not mandatory this just
 
06:19:54.510 --> 06:19:54.520 align:start position:0%
gives the planning board and ultimately
 
06:19:56.590 --> 06:19:56.600 align:start position:0%
the voters of the town the decision if
 
06:20:01.150 --> 06:20:01.160 align:start position:0%
they want to um charge an impact fee for
 
06:20:03.230 --> 06:20:03.240 align:start position:0%
uh under this Innovative land use
 
06:20:05.990 --> 06:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
controls so I think it's it's a logical
 
06:20:07.910 --> 06:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
addition I think I don't know why it was
 
06:20:09.430 --> 06:20:09.440 align:start position:0%
missing but the three words that are
 
06:20:10.990 --> 06:20:11.000 align:start position:0%
being added to this bill is probably one
 
06:20:13.430 --> 06:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
of the shortest Bills ever but uh for
 
06:20:15.868 --> 06:20:15.878 align:start position:0%
those reasons I would recommend passage
 
06:20:19.350 --> 06:20:19.360 align:start position:0%
of this bill to help enable um the
 
06:20:21.390 --> 06:20:21.400 align:start position:0%
impact fees to be more effective in uh
 
06:20:24.390 --> 06:20:24.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire thank
 
06:20:27.310 --> 06:20:27.320 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr power I appreciate that
 
06:20:28.590 --> 06:20:28.600 align:start position:0%
explanation I've got a better
 
06:20:30.830 --> 06:20:30.840 align:start position:0%
understanding of uh of the law now any
 
06:20:30.840 --> 06:20:34.948 align:start position:0%
understanding of uh of the law now any
questions

06:20:34.948 --> 06:20:34.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:37.070 --> 06:20:37.080 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you sir thank

anyone else want to testify seeing
 
06:20:47.628 --> 06:20:47.638 align:start position:0%
none um on this bill we have three in
 
06:20:50.350 --> 06:20:50.360 align:start position:0%
favor and I'll close the public hearing

at this time I will open the public
 
06:31:00.670 --> 06:31:00.680 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill 124 enabling a

Surplus money
 
06:31:06.868 --> 06:31:06.878 align:start position:0%
to the town for deposit in the city or
 
06:31:09.910 --> 06:31:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:12.948 --> 06:31:12.958 align:start position:0%
fund at this time the chair recognizes
 
06:31:15.868 --> 06:31:15.878 align:start position:0%
representative Davis to introduce the
 
06:31:18.910 --> 06:31:18.920 align:start position:0%
bill to our committee good afternoon and
 
06:31:21.708 --> 06:31:21.718 align:start position:0%

apologize for any confusion there's a
 
06:31:30.750 --> 06:31:30.760 align:start position:0%
couple of amendments here I believe the
 
06:31:33.270 --> 06:31:33.280 align:start position:0%
content is the same the one I just
 
06:31:34.548 --> 06:31:34.558 align:start position:0%
passed out
 
06:31:37.190 --> 06:31:37.200 align:start position:0%
uh puts me back at Prime sponsor and and
 
06:31:39.230 --> 06:31:39.240 align:start position:0%
so it I believe it's the two that you
 
06:31:40.990 --> 06:31:41.000 align:start position:0%
have in front of you are identical other
 
06:31:41.000 --> 06:31:41.750 align:start position:0%
have in front of you are identical other
than

06:31:41.750 --> 06:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
than
 
06:31:45.270 --> 06:31:45.280 align:start position:0%
that um so I'm here to to introduce
 
06:31:47.590 --> 06:31:47.600 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
06:31:52.030 --> 06:31:52.040 align:start position:0%
124 it pertains to uh Municipal and Town
 
06:31:57.030 --> 06:31:57.040 align:start position:0%
and County forest a community Forest so
 
06:32:00.310 --> 06:32:00.320 align:start position:0%
so I put this bill in because a member
 
06:32:02.830 --> 06:32:02.840 align:start position:0%
from the town forest for the town of
 
06:32:07.670 --> 06:32:07.680 align:start position:0%
arel came to me and in the the RSA right
 
06:32:10.350 --> 06:32:10.360 align:start position:0%
now there there's
 
06:32:13.190 --> 06:32:13.200 align:start position:0%
uh there's they they Timber they do
 
06:32:15.628 --> 06:32:15.638 align:start position:0%
timber harvesting on the this these
 
06:32:19.670 --> 06:32:19.680 align:start position:0%
Parcels they have 8,500 acres in their
 
06:32:22.150 --> 06:32:22.160 align:start position:0%
Town Forest and they generate quite a
 
06:32:24.868 --> 06:32:24.878 align:start position:0%
bit of Revenue each year so according to
 
06:32:27.070 --> 06:32:27.080 align:start position:0%
Dr the three things they can spend that
 
06:32:30.590 --> 06:32:30.600 align:start position:0%
money on they can buy more land they can
 
06:32:33.548 --> 06:32:33.558 align:start position:0%
maintain their land or they can buy
 
06:32:35.910 --> 06:32:35.920 align:start position:0%
something for the town uh through the
 
06:32:38.788 --> 06:32:38.798 align:start position:0%
select board if it's a benefit to their
 
06:32:40.430 --> 06:32:40.440 align:start position:0%
land so one year they bought a fire
 
06:32:42.990 --> 06:32:43.000 align:start position:0%
truck for the town of arrel and and what
 
06:32:46.190 --> 06:32:46.200 align:start position:0%
that the town of arel figured or Dr
 
06:32:48.230 --> 06:32:48.240 align:start position:0%
figured that if there was a fire that
 
06:32:51.910 --> 06:32:51.920 align:start position:0%
may save the the community Forest so the
 
06:32:53.548 --> 06:32:53.558 align:start position:0%
the intent
 
06:32:56.110 --> 06:32:56.120 align:start position:0%
originally was once they acquired the
 
06:32:57.788 --> 06:32:57.798 align:start position:0%
amount of land that they wanted their
 
06:33:00.468 --> 06:33:00.478 align:start position:0%
goal was 8,500 acres and it's pretty
 
06:33:02.310 --> 06:33:02.320 align:start position:0%
well maintained they harvest they do a
 
06:33:04.990 --> 06:33:05.000 align:start position:0%
harvest each year
 
06:33:06.510 --> 06:33:06.520 align:start position:0%
so they're at a point now where they
 
06:33:10.310 --> 06:33:10.320 align:start position:0%
wanted to use any surplus for for tax
 
06:33:13.070 --> 06:33:13.080 align:start position:0%
relief for the Town members and Dr
 
06:33:15.110 --> 06:33:15.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't allow it the way the RSA is
 
06:33:18.270 --> 06:33:18.280 align:start position:0%
written it's not clear enough uh so what
 
06:33:20.830 --> 06:33:20.840 align:start position:0%
this this does is bring a little bit of
 
06:33:25.030 --> 06:33:25.040 align:start position:0%
clarity so Dr would allow them if they
 
06:33:26.910 --> 06:33:26.920 align:start position:0%
so there's a board of three to five
 
06:33:30.350 --> 06:33:30.360 align:start position:0%
people on the on any town or Community
 
06:33:32.788 --> 06:33:32.798 align:start position:0%
Forest so it this doesn't mandate
 
06:33:34.990 --> 06:33:35.000 align:start position:0%
anything it gives them the opportunity
 
06:33:37.310 --> 06:33:37.320 align:start position:0%
if they deem they have a surplus they
 
06:33:40.270 --> 06:33:40.280 align:start position:0%
can offer that Surplus to the select
 
06:33:42.510 --> 06:33:42.520 align:start position:0%
board to put it through a warrant
 
06:33:44.350 --> 06:33:44.360 align:start position:0%
article so that the town could vote to
 
06:33:48.110 --> 06:33:48.120 align:start position:0%
accept that money without this bill a
 
06:33:49.750 --> 06:33:49.760 align:start position:0%
town like arrol could be sitting on
 
06:33:51.230 --> 06:33:51.240 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars that is kind of
 
06:33:55.468 --> 06:33:55.478 align:start position:0%
landlock they just can't use it um so
 
06:33:57.830 --> 06:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
the the idea would be so that they could
 
06:34:02.230 --> 06:34:02.240 align:start position:0%
lower their their tax base um I live in
 
06:34:04.548 --> 06:34:04.558 align:start position:0%
the town of milin we have a a town for
 
06:34:06.868 --> 06:34:06.878 align:start position:0%
us as well it's not as big as theirs our
 
06:34:10.230 --> 06:34:10.240 align:start position:0%
goal is 5,000 Acres we're at 3500 the
 
06:34:13.910 --> 06:34:13.920 align:start position:0%
way our ours was set up we can do this
 
06:34:15.708 --> 06:34:15.718 align:start position:0%
it's just it was set up properly from
 
06:34:18.070 --> 06:34:18.080 align:start position:0%
the beginning but towns like arrel and
 
06:34:20.628 --> 06:34:20.638 align:start position:0%
other towns that did not know how to
 
06:34:23.510 --> 06:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
properly set this up have a have a a
 
06:34:25.430 --> 06:34:25.440 align:start position:0%
block in their system right now so this
 
06:34:26.948 --> 06:34:26.958 align:start position:0%
would correct
 
06:34:30.270 --> 06:34:30.280 align:start position:0%
that and I mean that's that's a pretty
 
06:34:32.708 --> 06:34:32.718 align:start position:0%
simple bill this is all it does I'd be
 
06:34:38.430 --> 06:34:38.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:40.830 --> 06:34:40.840 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative Davis
 
06:34:43.350 --> 06:34:43.360 align:start position:0%
other questions representative stavis is
 
06:34:45.548 --> 06:34:45.558 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question thank you
 
06:34:47.270 --> 06:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you for taking my
 
06:34:50.628 --> 06:34:50.638 align:start position:0%
question if other towns are able to do
 
06:34:53.310 --> 06:34:53.320 align:start position:0%
this why
 
06:34:57.230 --> 06:34:57.240 align:start position:0%
isn't why is this needed well it it all
 
06:35:00.150 --> 06:35:00.160 align:start position:0%
depends how you set up your town forest
 
06:35:03.270 --> 06:35:03.280 align:start position:0%
in the first place the the members that
 
06:35:05.430 --> 06:35:05.440 align:start position:0%
set up the one in
 
06:35:08.510 --> 06:35:08.520 align:start position:0%
mil for a lack of better words they knew
 
06:35:11.190 --> 06:35:11.200 align:start position:0%
how to how to do it and they they set it
 
06:35:13.030 --> 06:35:13.040 align:start position:0%
up so they could use it in general funds
 
06:35:16.030 --> 06:35:16.040 align:start position:0%
if they had a surplus the one in arrrow
 
06:35:18.910 --> 06:35:18.920 align:start position:0%
wasn't set up like that so this would be
 
06:35:20.670 --> 06:35:20.680 align:start position:0%
a way for them to catch up with the
 
06:35:20.680 --> 06:35:22.750 align:start position:0%
a way for them to catch up with the
other

06:35:22.750 --> 06:35:22.760 align:start position:0%
other
 
06:35:26.548 --> 06:35:26.558 align:start position:0%
towns yes followup thank you madam
 
06:35:30.388 --> 06:35:30.398 align:start position:0%
chair but if it's the state that
 
06:35:33.190 --> 06:35:33.200 align:start position:0%
determines what the towns can do I'm
 
06:35:36.030 --> 06:35:36.040 align:start position:0%
still not not understanding why towns
 
06:35:39.150 --> 06:35:39.160 align:start position:0%
cannot do it if some are already doing
 
06:35:43.910 --> 06:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
it the the way Dr interprets the RSA I
 
06:35:46.910 --> 06:35:46.920 align:start position:0%
was told that they they cannot do it
 
06:35:50.830 --> 06:35:50.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:53.310 --> 06:35:53.320 align:start position:0%
amendment I I don't I I hope I answered
 
06:35:54.910 --> 06:35:54.920 align:start position:0%
your question I don't know the it does
 
06:35:57.670 --> 06:35:57.680 align:start position:0%
sound unfair but it the way it was set
 
06:36:00.510 --> 06:36:00.520 align:start position:0%
up in mil they put that provision in
 
06:36:06.230 --> 06:36:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:08.628 --> 06:36:08.638 align:start position:0%
further questions representative frock
 
06:36:10.670 --> 06:36:10.680 align:start position:0%
is recognized for a question thank you
 
06:36:13.468 --> 06:36:13.478 align:start position:0%
madam chair uh representative Davis
 
06:36:16.350 --> 06:36:16.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for appearing and for uh
 
06:36:21.310 --> 06:36:21.320 align:start position:0%
presenting this bill I have a question
 
06:36:24.468 --> 06:36:24.478 align:start position:0%
on the last sentence which says the
 
06:36:26.788 --> 06:36:26.798 align:start position:0%
legislative body of the
 
06:36:30.030 --> 06:36:30.040 align:start position:0%
municipality shall vote to accept the
 
06:36:34.150 --> 06:36:34.160 align:start position:0%
Surplus for deposit in my mind voting
 
06:36:37.230 --> 06:36:37.240 align:start position:0%
implies a choice but the way this is
 
06:36:40.468 --> 06:36:40.478 align:start position:0%
written you shall vote to accept there's
 
06:36:42.990 --> 06:36:43.000 align:start position:0%
no choice and perhaps some better
 
06:36:46.190 --> 06:36:46.200 align:start position:0%
language could be worked
 
06:36:49.670 --> 06:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
out that's a good question possibly uh
 
06:36:52.548 --> 06:36:52.558 align:start position:0%
this whole Amendment it says not
 
06:36:57.230 --> 06:36:57.240 align:start position:0%
withstanding RSA 31 semicolon 95- B if
 
06:36:59.990 --> 06:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
the forestry committee or conservation
 
06:37:01.830 --> 06:37:01.840 align:start position:0%
committee which is the group that has
 
06:37:04.230 --> 06:37:04.240 align:start position:0%
control over the forestry committee
 
06:37:05.990 --> 06:37:06.000 align:start position:0%
determines there is
 
06:37:08.548 --> 06:37:08.558 align:start position:0%
a that the special Forest maintenance
 
06:37:12.070 --> 06:37:12.080 align:start position:0%
fund has a surplus that committee may
 
06:37:14.590 --> 06:37:14.600 align:start position:0%
offer this Surplus to the municipality
 
06:37:18.350 --> 06:37:18.360 align:start position:0%
which I believe is the select board for
 
06:37:21.230 --> 06:37:21.240 align:start position:0%
depositing the unreserved fund balance
 
06:37:23.230 --> 06:37:23.240 align:start position:0%
the legislative body which would be the
 
06:37:25.388 --> 06:37:25.398 align:start position:0%
town people if this came as under a
 
06:37:25.398 --> 06:37:26.910 align:start position:0%
town people if this came as under a
warrant

06:37:26.910 --> 06:37:26.920 align:start position:0%
warrant
 
06:37:30.788 --> 06:37:30.798 align:start position:0%
article I guess shall shall vote to
 
06:37:33.590 --> 06:37:33.600 align:start position:0%
accept this deposit I I can't imagine
 
06:37:35.030 --> 06:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
somebody turning it down so that
 
06:37:38.110 --> 06:37:38.120 align:start position:0%
property taxes would would be alleviated
 
06:37:40.468 --> 06:37:40.478 align:start position:0%
but they have the option they they shall
 
06:37:42.510 --> 06:37:42.520 align:start position:0%
vote Yes or No whether they want to
 
06:37:43.548 --> 06:37:43.558 align:start position:0%
accept that
 
06:37:43.558 --> 06:37:45.830 align:start position:0%
accept that
money

06:37:45.830 --> 06:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
money
 
06:37:48.788 --> 06:37:48.798 align:start position:0%
followup yes followup wouldn't it be
 
06:37:52.548 --> 06:37:52.558 align:start position:0%
just simpler to say that if the
 
06:37:55.110 --> 06:37:55.120 align:start position:0%
conservation committee or the forestry
 
06:37:57.788 --> 06:37:57.798 align:start position:0%
committee determines that there's a
 
06:38:00.230 --> 06:38:00.240 align:start position:0%
surplus it shall be deposited in the
 
06:38:03.190 --> 06:38:03.200 align:start position:0%
town's general fund well I I thought
 
06:38:03.200 --> 06:38:04.070 align:start position:0%
town's general fund well I I thought
this

06:38:04.070 --> 06:38:04.080 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:38:06.990 --> 06:38:07.000 align:start position:0%
would give more control so that like the
 
06:38:08.388 --> 06:38:08.398 align:start position:0%
select board just doesn't spend it
 
06:38:10.510 --> 06:38:10.520 align:start position:0%
frivolously on whatever they want the
 
06:38:12.868 --> 06:38:12.878 align:start position:0%
towns people could have would have to
 
06:38:16.670 --> 06:38:16.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:19.030 --> 06:38:19.040 align:start position:0%
control one more
 
06:38:21.150 --> 06:38:21.160 align:start position:0%
followup yes you may have one more
 
06:38:23.468 --> 06:38:23.478 align:start position:0%
followup thank you madam
 
06:38:23.478 --> 06:38:25.590 align:start position:0%
followup thank you madam
chair

06:38:25.590 --> 06:38:25.600 align:start position:0%
chair
 
06:38:30.270 --> 06:38:30.280 align:start position:0%
so once the funds are accepted into the
 
06:38:30.280 --> 06:38:31.548 align:start position:0%
so once the funds are accepted into the
general

06:38:31.548 --> 06:38:31.558 align:start position:0%
general
 
06:38:36.430 --> 06:38:36.440 align:start position:0%
fund then it could be spent however uh
 
06:38:38.948 --> 06:38:38.958 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure I understand
 
06:38:43.070 --> 06:38:43.080 align:start position:0%
why what what the advantage is or where
 
06:38:45.830 --> 06:38:45.840 align:start position:0%
where the town's people would gain
 
06:38:48.388 --> 06:38:48.398 align:start position:0%
control of this money so that it could
 
06:38:51.548 --> 06:38:51.558 align:start position:0%
be used for a specific
 
06:38:54.590 --> 06:38:54.600 align:start position:0%
purpose which is what I heard you say in
 
06:38:59.070 --> 06:38:59.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:00.990 --> 06:39:01.000 align:start position:0%
question I don't really have a good
 
06:39:03.910 --> 06:39:03.920 align:start position:0%
answer for you I'm sorry
 
06:39:05.910 --> 06:39:05.920 align:start position:0%
representative grund is recognized for a
 
06:39:07.510 --> 06:39:07.520 align:start position:0%
question thank you madam chair and thank
 
06:39:10.230 --> 06:39:10.240 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question yes is it
 
06:39:11.948 --> 06:39:11.958 align:start position:0%
possible that a the Lo the local
 
06:39:14.510 --> 06:39:14.520 align:start position:0%
legislative body can just change this on
 
06:39:17.628 --> 06:39:17.638 align:start position:0%
their own versus having to make it a
 
06:39:17.638 --> 06:39:19.948 align:start position:0%
their own versus having to make it a
state

06:39:19.948 --> 06:39:19.958 align:start position:0%
state
 
06:39:24.670 --> 06:39:24.680 align:start position:0%
RSA the uh the the member of the
 
06:39:29.070 --> 06:39:29.080 align:start position:0%
aeral um Community Forest came to me
 
06:39:31.910 --> 06:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
asking he said that they wanted to know
 
06:39:33.910 --> 06:39:33.920 align:start position:0%
if we could put this in and I
 
06:39:35.430 --> 06:39:35.440 align:start position:0%
I don't know if they have the ability to
 
06:39:38.910 --> 06:39:38.920 align:start position:0%
change that on their own I do not know
 
06:39:38.920 --> 06:39:41.388 align:start position:0%
change that on their own I do not know
that

06:39:41.388 --> 06:39:41.398 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:39:45.590 --> 06:39:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:48.628 --> 06:39:48.638 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
 
06:39:51.708 --> 06:39:51.718 align:start position:0%
you so that's the one and only pink card
 
06:39:54.590 --> 06:39:54.600 align:start position:0%
that I have so I will ask at this time
 
06:39:56.510 --> 06:39:56.520 align:start position:0%
is there anyone present who wishes to
 
06:39:59.310 --> 06:39:59.320 align:start position:0%

representative Diane Kelly the prime
 
06:48:16.230 --> 06:48:16.240 align:start position:0%
sponsor of this bill good afternoon and
 
06:48:17.670 --> 06:48:17.680 align:start position:0%
welcome to Municipal and County
 
06:48:20.070 --> 06:48:20.080 align:start position:0%
government good afternoon Madam chair
 
06:48:22.150 --> 06:48:22.160 align:start position:0%
and members of the committee um did you
 
06:48:24.270 --> 06:48:24.280 align:start position:0%
all or did some of you at least receive
 
06:48:28.230 --> 06:48:28.240 align:start position:0%
the email last night um I sent photos um
 
06:48:31.510 --> 06:48:31.520 align:start position:0%
regarding the 5G towers that are um part
 
06:48:34.830 --> 06:48:34.840 align:start position:0%
of the discussion um the first one is in
 
06:48:38.070 --> 06:48:38.080 align:start position:0%
front of the Bedford PD it's big huge
 
06:48:40.788 --> 06:48:40.798 align:start position:0%
tall scary looking thing representative
 
06:48:42.788 --> 06:48:42.798 align:start position:0%
Kelly could you pull the mic closer
 
06:48:46.628 --> 06:48:46.638 align:start position:0%
because I'm having trouble hearing you
 
06:48:50.510 --> 06:48:50.520 align:start position:0%
yeah is that better yes it is thank you
 
06:48:53.910 --> 06:48:53.920 align:start position:0%
anyway um the tower in front of the um
 
06:48:56.430 --> 06:48:56.440 align:start position:0%
Bedford Police Department is a rather
 
06:48:58.270 --> 06:48:58.280 align:start position:0%
large one and then the newer ones which
 
06:49:00.910 --> 06:49:00.920 align:start position:0%
are considerably smaller and harder to
 
06:49:04.830 --> 06:49:04.840 align:start position:0%
see at the top of utility polls um
 
06:49:07.830 --> 06:49:07.840 align:start position:0%
anyway um I am representative Diane
 
06:49:10.548 --> 06:49:10.558 align:start position:0%
Kelly from Hillsboro District 32 and I'm
 
06:49:12.910 --> 06:49:12.920 align:start position:0%
here today to introduce HB 501 a
 
06:49:14.510 --> 06:49:14.520 align:start position:0%
critical piece of legislation that
 
06:49:16.350 --> 06:49:16.360 align:start position:0%
empowers local communities to make
 
06:49:18.670 --> 06:49:18.680 align:start position:0%
informed decisions about Wireless
 
06:49:21.270 --> 06:49:21.280 align:start position:0%
infrastructure within their own borders
 
06:49:22.910 --> 06:49:22.920 align:start position:0%
this bill builds upon the findings of
 
06:49:24.910 --> 06:49:24.920 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire State commission to
 
06:49:26.548 --> 06:49:26.558 align:start position:0%
study the environmental and health
 
06:49:29.310 --> 06:49:29.320 align:start position:0%
effects of evolving 5G technology which
 
06:49:31.788 --> 06:49:31.798 align:start position:0%
is also known as the 5G commission the
 
06:49:33.388 --> 06:49:33.398 align:start position:0%
commission found that the insurance
 
06:49:35.830 --> 06:49:35.840 align:start position:0%
industry looks on microwave radiation
 
06:49:37.948 --> 06:49:37.958 align:start position:0%
from cell towers as a hazardous
 
06:49:40.510 --> 06:49:40.520 align:start position:0%
pollutant and will not ordinarily even
 
06:49:43.150 --> 06:49:43.160 align:start position:0%
insure damages caused by ionizing or
 
06:49:45.868 --> 06:49:45.878 align:start position:0%
non-ionizing microwave radiation the
 
06:49:47.750 --> 06:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
commission further found that microwave
 
06:49:49.868 --> 06:49:49.878 align:start position:0%
radiation levels are not even being
 
06:49:53.868 --> 06:49:53.878 align:start position:0%
measured or documented by Dees DHHS or
 
06:49:56.708 --> 06:49:56.718 align:start position:0%
any other state agency furthermore the
 
06:49:58.350 --> 06:49:58.360 align:start position:0%
commission reported that while many
 
06:50:00.350 --> 06:50:00.360 align:start position:0%
Studies have indicated that microwave
 
06:50:02.150 --> 06:50:02.160 align:start position:0%
radiation has biological and
 
06:50:04.510 --> 06:50:04.520 align:start position:0%
environmental effects on humans
 
06:50:06.230 --> 06:50:06.240 align:start position:0%
protective standards for New Hampshire
 
06:50:09.628 --> 06:50:09.638 align:start position:0%
Flora flora and fauna don't exist and
 
06:50:11.670 --> 06:50:11.680 align:start position:0%
deserve much greater consideration and
 
06:50:14.948 --> 06:50:14.958 align:start position:0%
study for these reasons I believe that
 
06:50:18.190 --> 06:50:18.200 align:start position:0%
um RF RSA 12K must be amended so that
 
06:50:20.030 --> 06:50:20.040 align:start position:0%
the state takes a more neutral position
 
06:50:22.628 --> 06:50:22.638 align:start position:0%
on the roll out of 5G in New Hampshire
 
06:50:24.750 --> 06:50:24.760 align:start position:0%
as the law currently exists City
 
06:50:26.430 --> 06:50:26.440 align:start position:0%
governments face significant legal
 
06:50:28.788 --> 06:50:28.798 align:start position:0%
pressure if they try to deny a cell
 
06:50:31.868 --> 06:50:31.878 align:start position:0%
tower and they're unable to even address
 
06:50:33.548 --> 06:50:33.558 align:start position:0%
objections from residents and business
 
06:50:36.350 --> 06:50:36.360 align:start position:0%
owners around Wireless infrastructure if
 
06:50:38.030 --> 06:50:38.040 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire refuses to
 
06:50:39.788 --> 06:50:39.798 align:start position:0%
implement the findings of the 5G
 
06:50:41.948 --> 06:50:41.958 align:start position:0%
commission and has failed to regulate or
 
06:50:44.350 --> 06:50:44.360 align:start position:0%
track radiation pollution levels then
 
06:50:46.190 --> 06:50:46.200 align:start position:0%
the state should leave the decision of
 
06:50:48.830 --> 06:50:48.840 align:start position:0%
when or where to site a cell tower up to
 
06:50:51.590 --> 06:50:51.600 align:start position:0%
the individual cities and towns as we
 
06:50:53.708 --> 06:50:53.718 align:start position:0%
navigate the rapidly evolving landscape
 
06:50:56.230 --> 06:50:56.240 align:start position:0%
of Wireless technology it's imperative
 
06:50:59.030 --> 06:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
that we balance progress with Prudence
 
06:51:01.030 --> 06:51:01.040 align:start position:0%
this bill is not about halting
 
06:51:03.388 --> 06:51:03.398 align:start position:0%
technological advancement but rather
 
06:51:05.190 --> 06:51:05.200 align:start position:0%
it's about ensuring that the people of
 
06:51:07.430 --> 06:51:07.440 align:start position:0%
this state have a voice in shaping the
 
06:51:10.030 --> 06:51:10.040 align:start position:0%
landscape of their own
 
06:51:12.868 --> 06:51:12.878 align:start position:0%
communities thank you for your time
 
06:51:14.548 --> 06:51:14.558 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Kelly for that
 
06:51:16.708 --> 06:51:16.718 align:start position:0%
bill introduction are you willing to
 
06:51:20.548 --> 06:51:20.558 align:start position:0%

two key items uh because right now we
 
06:52:34.670 --> 06:52:34.680 align:start position:0%
are seeing two things number one
 
06:52:37.670 --> 06:52:37.680 align:start position:0%
unprecedented demand from consumers for
 
06:52:40.190 --> 06:52:40.200 align:start position:0%
more Wireless services and the rate at
 
06:52:42.510 --> 06:52:42.520 align:start position:0%
which that growth is happening is is
 
06:52:45.110 --> 06:52:45.120 align:start position:0%
happening at exponential rates number
 
06:52:47.590 --> 06:52:47.600 align:start position:0%
two a desire for improved connectivity
 
06:52:50.388 --> 06:52:50.398 align:start position:0%
in all communities in this state now our
 
06:52:52.150 --> 06:52:52.160 align:start position:0%
members are working hard to respond to
 
06:52:54.230 --> 06:52:54.240 align:start position:0%
both of those items I just mentioned
 
06:52:57.868 --> 06:52:57.878 align:start position:0%
investing $30 billion in 2023 alone in
 
06:53:00.830 --> 06:53:00.840 align:start position:0%
private resources to upgrade and expand
 
06:53:02.510 --> 06:53:02.520 align:start position:0%
the nation's networks including here in
 
06:53:04.548 --> 06:53:04.558 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire but I want but I want to
 
06:53:07.670 --> 06:53:07.680 align:start position:0%
speak specific to this bill because
 
06:53:09.468 --> 06:53:09.478 align:start position:0%
where that investment goes that I just
 
06:53:11.830 --> 06:53:11.840 align:start position:0%
mentioned and how those resources are
 
06:53:14.750 --> 06:53:14.760 align:start position:0%
invested depends more than anything on
 
06:53:16.548 --> 06:53:16.558 align:start position:0%
predictability especially for our
 
06:53:18.990 --> 06:53:19.000 align:start position:0%
members who design and plan their
 
06:53:21.388 --> 06:53:21.398 align:start position:0%
infrastructure Investments 18 to 24
 
06:53:24.670 --> 06:53:24.680 align:start position:0%
months in advance speaking specifically
 
06:53:26.750 --> 06:53:26.760 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire for the last two
 
06:53:28.708 --> 06:53:28.718 align:start position:0%
decades you all have had in place
 
06:53:31.030 --> 06:53:31.040 align:start position:0%
Wireless sighting policies that fit
 
06:53:32.430 --> 06:53:32.440 align:start position:0%
within the framework that I just talked
 
06:53:34.468 --> 06:53:34.478 align:start position:0%
talked about they provide a very clear
 
06:53:36.788 --> 06:53:36.798 align:start position:0%
level of predictability and they set
 
06:53:39.510 --> 06:53:39.520 align:start position:0%
very clear rules of the road in terms of
 
06:53:41.868 --> 06:53:41.878 align:start position:0%
Wireless permitting for both providers
 
06:53:43.708 --> 06:53:43.718 align:start position:0%
and local governments very important
 
06:53:46.430 --> 06:53:46.440 align:start position:0%
piece as well and in no uncertain terms
 
06:53:49.548 --> 06:53:49.558 align:start position:0%
House Bill 501 would essentially
 
06:53:52.230 --> 06:53:52.240 align:start position:0%
eliminate almost all of those rules the
 
06:53:54.788 --> 06:53:54.798 align:start position:0%
bill effectively deletes a broad swath
 
06:53:56.990 --> 06:53:57.000 align:start position:0%
of current state law governing Wireless
 
06:53:59.270 --> 06:53:59.280 align:start position:0%
permitting and it would replace it with
 
06:54:02.030 --> 06:54:02.040 align:start position:0%
what what are vague unclear and likely
 
06:54:04.788 --> 06:54:04.798 align:start position:0%
un lawful language I want to be a little
 
06:54:06.590 --> 06:54:06.600 align:start position:0%
specific about what I'm talking about
 
06:54:08.948 --> 06:54:08.958 align:start position:0%
here the bill deletes these are two
 
06:54:11.030 --> 06:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
examples the the bill deletes a
 
06:54:13.628 --> 06:54:13.638 align:start position:0%
requirement that quote carriers should
 
06:54:16.510 --> 06:54:16.520 align:start position:0%
minimize the visual impact of a wireless
 
06:54:19.150 --> 06:54:19.160 align:start position:0%
facility the bill also deletes a mandate
 
06:54:21.830 --> 06:54:21.840 align:start position:0%
that state law not encroach on quote a
 
06:54:24.388 --> 06:54:24.398 align:start position:0%
municipality's zoning and Building Code
 
06:54:27.070 --> 06:54:27.080 align:start position:0%
Enforcement Powers those are just two
 
06:54:28.430 --> 06:54:28.440 align:start position:0%
examples and I'm happy to share some
 
06:54:31.830 --> 06:54:31.840 align:start position:0%
others in the Q&amp;A finally it is highly
 
06:54:33.750 --> 06:54:33.760 align:start position:0%
likely that the Bill runs a foul of
 
06:54:36.030 --> 06:54:36.040 align:start position:0%
federal law as well the Federal
 
06:54:38.350 --> 06:54:38.360 align:start position:0%
Communications Act and the FCC the
 
06:54:41.190 --> 06:54:41.200 align:start position:0%
Federal Communications Commission are es
 
06:54:42.670 --> 06:54:42.680 align:start position:0%
they are both especially clear rules
 
06:54:45.430 --> 06:54:45.440 align:start position:0%
from the FCC excuse me are especially
 
06:54:48.350 --> 06:54:48.360 align:start position:0%
clear that states and localities cannot
 
06:54:49.868 --> 06:54:49.878 align:start position:0%
pass laws that would effectively
 
06:54:52.708 --> 06:54:52.718 align:start position:0%
prohibit terms of wireless service and
 
06:54:55.590 --> 06:54:55.600 align:start position:0%
in practice that is what this bill does
 
06:54:57.388 --> 06:54:57.398 align:start position:0%
and so for these reasons we would urge a
 
06:54:59.990 --> 06:55:00.000 align:start position:0%
no vote on House Bill 501 and I will
 
06:55:01.948 --> 06:55:01.958 align:start position:0%
just add Madam chair uh we did I did
 
06:55:06.510 --> 06:55:06.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:09.310 --> 06:55:09.320 align:start position:0%
well thank you Mr Crandle so with
 
06:55:10.868 --> 06:55:10.878 align:start position:0%
regards to submission of written
 
06:55:12.590 --> 06:55:12.600 align:start position:0%
testimony do you have
 
06:55:16.990 --> 06:55:17.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:20.070 --> 06:55:20.080 align:start position:0%
okay Miss Susi has that thank you for
 
06:55:22.510 --> 06:55:22.520 align:start position:0%
passing that out and you're willing to
 
06:55:24.708 --> 06:55:24.718 align:start position:0%
take questions absolutely yes questions
 
06:55:27.070 --> 06:55:27.080 align:start position:0%
for Mr
 
06:55:29.310 --> 06:55:29.320 align:start position:0%
Crandle representative Dolan has a
 
06:55:31.270 --> 06:55:31.280 align:start position:0%
question thank you madam chair and thank
 
06:55:33.628 --> 06:55:33.638 align:start position:0%
you for uh taking my question question
 
06:55:36.830 --> 06:55:36.840 align:start position:0%
is do you have any um independent
 
06:55:36.840 --> 06:55:38.350 align:start position:0%
is do you have any um independent
evidence

06:55:38.350 --> 06:55:38.360 align:start position:0%
evidence
 
06:55:41.548 --> 06:55:41.558 align:start position:0%
of uh these towers impacting uh
 
06:55:43.350 --> 06:55:43.360 align:start position:0%
residents health
 
06:55:45.628 --> 06:55:45.638 align:start position:0%
concerns yeah thank you for the question
 
06:55:48.190 --> 06:55:48.200 align:start position:0%
so speaking to health concerns and
 
06:55:50.430 --> 06:55:50.440 align:start position:0%
health effects I want to really
 
06:55:53.670 --> 06:55:53.680 align:start position:0%
emphasize uh what I'm about to share it
 
06:55:56.430 --> 06:55:56.440 align:start position:0%
is the consensus of both the US and
 
06:55:58.910 --> 06:55:58.920 align:start position:0%
international scientific community that
 
06:56:00.788 --> 06:56:00.798 align:start position:0%
there are no known adverse health
 
06:56:02.868 --> 06:56:02.878 align:start position:0%
effects as a result of the level of
 
06:56:05.110 --> 06:56:05.120 align:start position:0%
radio frequency energy emitted by
 
06:56:07.590 --> 06:56:07.600 align:start position:0%
Wireless infrastructure uh cell phones
 
06:56:11.270 --> 06:56:11.280 align:start position:0%
and wre wireless equipment the FCC has
 
06:56:13.230 --> 06:56:13.240 align:start position:0%
examined and actively examines this
 
06:56:15.548 --> 06:56:15.558 align:start position:0%
issue in terms of regulation of our
 
06:56:17.750 --> 06:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
infrastructure the Food and Drug
 
06:56:19.468 --> 06:56:19.478 align:start position:0%
Administration the World Health
 
06:56:22.150 --> 06:56:22.160 align:start position:0%
Organization the NIH National Cancer
 
06:56:24.430 --> 06:56:24.440 align:start position:0%
Institute have all found through their
 
06:56:26.590 --> 06:56:26.600 align:start position:0%
studies over the last decade
 
06:56:28.430 --> 06:56:28.440 align:start position:0%
approximately over the last decade that
 
06:56:30.270 --> 06:56:30.280 align:start position:0%
there are no known adverse health
 
06:56:32.750 --> 06:56:32.760 align:start position:0%
effects as it relates to this issue and
 
06:56:35.310 --> 06:56:35.320 align:start position:0%
so we at ctia are going have and will
 
06:56:38.670 --> 06:56:38.680 align:start position:0%
continue to trust and rely on the expert
 
06:56:40.628 --> 06:56:40.638 align:start position:0%
opinion of those organizations that I
 
06:56:42.628 --> 06:56:42.638 align:start position:0%
just share that I just mentioned I will
 
06:56:46.750 --> 06:56:46.760 align:start position:0%
also share that ctia we have a website
 
06:56:49.628 --> 06:56:49.638 align:start position:0%
www.wireless Health fact.org that
 
06:56:51.788 --> 06:56:51.798 align:start position:0%
expands extensively upon what I just
 
06:56:53.670 --> 06:56:53.680 align:start position:0%
said and provides a significant amount
 
06:56:55.548 --> 06:56:55.558 align:start position:0%
of background information related to
 
06:56:58.030 --> 06:56:58.040 align:start position:0%
those items
 
06:57:00.990 --> 06:57:01.000 align:start position:0%
representative further questions
 
06:57:03.150 --> 06:57:03.160 align:start position:0%
representative FR is is recognized for a
 
06:57:06.230 --> 06:57:06.240 align:start position:0%
question thank you madam chair uh thank
 
06:57:10.430 --> 06:57:10.440 align:start position:0%
you Mr kandle for your testimony help me
 
06:57:14.510 --> 06:57:14.520 align:start position:0%
understand is there any sort of a
 
06:57:18.868 --> 06:57:18.878 align:start position:0%
difference in in terms of either
 
06:57:24.350 --> 06:57:24.360 align:start position:0%
intensity or the way that the microwaves
 
06:57:32.310 --> 06:57:32.320 align:start position:0%
propagate between 5G and 4G or 10g that
 
06:57:36.388 --> 06:57:36.398 align:start position:0%
I can buy from Comcast whatever that is
 
06:57:37.150 --> 06:57:37.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
06:57:38.948 --> 06:57:38.958 align:start position:0%
representative so first and foremost I
 
06:57:40.670 --> 06:57:40.680 align:start position:0%
want to emphasize for you all I'm not a
 
06:57:44.270 --> 06:57:44.280 align:start position:0%
scientist um I will also add that uh a
 
06:57:46.270 --> 06:57:46.280 align:start position:0%
following witness is going to focus more
 
06:57:49.150 --> 06:57:49.160 align:start position:0%
on the science related to this issue but
 
06:57:51.468 --> 06:57:51.478 align:start position:0%
representative I do specific to your
 
06:57:53.310 --> 06:57:53.320 align:start position:0%
question do need to point back to what I
 
06:57:56.270 --> 06:57:56.280 align:start position:0%
just shared a minute ago that this issue
 
06:57:57.830 --> 06:57:57.840 align:start position:0%
and it's an important one has been
 
06:58:00.150 --> 06:58:00.160 align:start position:0%
looked at by a range of organizations
 
06:58:02.110 --> 06:58:02.120 align:start position:0%
that focus on these items specific
 
06:58:03.510 --> 06:58:03.520 align:start position:0%
specifically and have come to that
 
06:58:04.910 --> 06:58:04.920 align:start position:0%
conclusion that there are no known
 
06:58:09.190 --> 06:58:09.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:12.468 --> 06:58:12.478 align:start position:0%
effects additional
 
06:58:14.628 --> 06:58:14.638 align:start position:0%
questions representative majori is
 
06:58:16.230 --> 06:58:16.240 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question thank you
 
06:58:17.350 --> 06:58:17.360 align:start position:0%
madam chairwoman and thank you for
 
06:58:19.430 --> 06:58:19.440 align:start position:0%
taking my question I'm I'm trying to
 
06:58:22.468 --> 06:58:22.478 align:start position:0%
reconcile in my mind line 17 of the bill
 
06:58:25.110 --> 06:58:25.120 align:start position:0%
Roman five which says municipalities May
 
06:58:28.750 --> 06:58:28.760 align:start position:0%
enact rules uh rules and regulations to
 
06:58:31.270 --> 06:58:31.280 align:start position:0%
enforce the provisions of the section
 
06:58:33.468 --> 06:58:33.478 align:start position:0%
provided that regulations are consistent
 
06:58:37.190 --> 06:58:37.200 align:start position:0%
with state and federal law so doesn't
 
06:58:39.708 --> 06:58:39.718 align:start position:0%
that bring us I'm wondering if that line
 
06:58:41.788 --> 06:58:41.798 align:start position:0%
brings us right back
 
06:58:44.948 --> 06:58:44.958 align:start position:0%
to to where we were to begin with and
 
06:58:47.230 --> 06:58:47.240 align:start position:0%
therefore we why even have this
 
06:58:49.190 --> 06:58:49.200 align:start position:0%
bill I would agree with you
 
06:58:51.510 --> 06:58:51.520 align:start position:0%
representative um in terms of our
 
06:58:53.070 --> 06:58:53.080 align:start position:0%
opposition to this bill but if if you
 
06:58:54.788 --> 06:58:54.798 align:start position:0%
don't mind can I expand a little bit
 
06:58:57.990 --> 06:58:58.000 align:start position:0%
upon that yes so New Hampshire's citing
 
06:59:00.310 --> 06:59:00.320 align:start position:0%
statute is approximately seven pages I
 
06:59:02.590 --> 06:59:02.600 align:start position:0%
have it right here in this binder um it
 
06:59:04.990 --> 06:59:05.000 align:start position:0%
is extensive in terms of what it lays
 
06:59:07.430 --> 06:59:07.440 align:start position:0%
out in terms of requirements on us as
 
06:59:10.310 --> 06:59:10.320 align:start position:0%
providers but also very clear and
 
06:59:13.110 --> 06:59:13.120 align:start position:0%
consistent range of items in terms of
 
06:59:14.990 --> 06:59:15.000 align:start position:0%
responsibilities that local governments
 
06:59:17.350 --> 06:59:17.360 align:start position:0%
can take and impose on us as providers
 
06:59:19.070 --> 06:59:19.080 align:start position:0%
when we want to deploy our equipment I
 
06:59:21.270 --> 06:59:21.280 align:start position:0%
want to share two examples very
 
06:59:22.788 --> 06:59:22.798 align:start position:0%
important pieces that would be deleted
 
06:59:25.230 --> 06:59:25.240 align:start position:0%
by this bill each carrier or its
 
06:59:26.948 --> 06:59:26.958 align:start position:0%
appointed agent doing business or
 
06:59:28.948 --> 06:59:28.958 align:start position:0%
seeking to do business in this state
 
06:59:31.070 --> 06:59:31.080 align:start position:0%
shall comply with all applicable State
 
06:59:34.190 --> 06:59:34.200 align:start position:0%
and Municipal land use regulation laws
 
06:59:36.830 --> 06:59:36.840 align:start position:0%
that will be deleted if this bill were
 
06:59:39.350 --> 06:59:39.360 align:start position:0%
to were to pass and then one other item
 
06:59:41.310 --> 06:59:41.320 align:start position:0%
any person prior to constructing a new
 
06:59:43.788 --> 06:59:43.798 align:start position:0%
tower in any location where no approval
 
06:59:45.590 --> 06:59:45.600 align:start position:0%
is required but is visible from any
 
06:59:47.350 --> 06:59:47.360 align:start position:0%
other New Hampshire municipality within
 
06:59:49.430 --> 06:59:49.440 align:start position:0%
20 miles shall provide written
 
06:59:51.150 --> 06:59:51.160 align:start position:0%
notification of such planned
 
06:59:53.230 --> 06:59:53.240 align:start position:0%
construction to other municipalities
 
06:59:55.910 --> 06:59:55.920 align:start position:0%
within that 20 mile range that would ALS
 
06:59:58.030 --> 06:59:58.040 align:start position:0%
that those are two examples of items
 
06:59:59.868 --> 06:59:59.878 align:start position:0%
that are in those seven pages of of New
 
07:00:02.030 --> 07:00:02.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law right now that would be
 
07:00:05.190 --> 07:00:05.200 align:start position:0%
moved and boiled down to a much smaller
 
07:00:07.430 --> 07:00:07.440 align:start position:0%
package if you will uh that is House
 
07:00:07.440 --> 07:00:11.070 align:start position:0%
package if you will uh that is House
Bill

07:00:11.070 --> 07:00:11.080 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:12.910 --> 07:00:12.920 align:start position:0%
501 yes
 
07:00:15.110 --> 07:00:15.120 align:start position:0%
followup thank you so if I understand
 
07:00:19.070 --> 07:00:19.080 align:start position:0%
you correctly then still would have to
 
07:00:21.788 --> 07:00:21.798 align:start position:0%
comply with state and federal law but
 
07:00:24.190 --> 07:00:24.200 align:start position:0%
local control would for all intent and
 
07:00:27.590 --> 07:00:27.600 align:start position:0%
purpose be completely eliminated so I'm
 
07:00:31.150 --> 07:00:31.160 align:start position:0%
not a lawyer so I'll def defer I want to
 
07:00:32.788 --> 07:00:32.798 align:start position:0%
be careful and answering your the last
 
07:00:34.990 --> 07:00:35.000 align:start position:0%
part of your question there in my
 
07:00:36.788 --> 07:00:36.798 align:start position:0%
opinion here's what I want to put a fine
 
07:00:38.388 --> 07:00:38.398 align:start position:0%
point on my testimony and answering your
 
07:00:40.868 --> 07:00:40.878 align:start position:0%
question there is nothing in New
 
07:00:43.388 --> 07:00:43.398 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law right now that and I want
 
07:00:45.150 --> 07:00:45.160 align:start position:0%
to be very clear in how I'm how I'm
 
07:00:46.948 --> 07:00:46.958 align:start position:0%
referring to this there's nothing in
 
07:00:48.670 --> 07:00:48.680 align:start position:0%
state law right now that prevents a
 
07:00:51.310 --> 07:00:51.320 align:start position:0%
locality from denying a permit for a
 
07:00:53.510 --> 07:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
wireless tower or other equipment
 
07:00:56.628 --> 07:00:56.638 align:start position:0%
provided that those requirements meet
 
07:00:59.070 --> 07:00:59.080 align:start position:0%
the legal standards s sorry let me
 
07:01:01.070 --> 07:01:01.080 align:start position:0%
rephrase that there's nothing to stop a
 
07:01:02.868 --> 07:01:02.878 align:start position:0%
local government from denying a permit
 
07:01:04.430 --> 07:01:04.440 align:start position:0%
based on the legal standards that they
 
07:01:07.230 --> 07:01:07.240 align:start position:0%
set out in their local ordinance now
 
07:01:09.070 --> 07:01:09.080 align:start position:0%
that local ordinance does need to also
 
07:01:11.468 --> 07:01:11.478 align:start position:0%
comply with state state rules state
 
07:01:13.830 --> 07:01:13.840 align:start position:0%
regulations and state laws federal laws
 
07:01:16.070 --> 07:01:16.080 align:start position:0%
and regulations but that is no different
 
07:01:17.868 --> 07:01:17.878 align:start position:0%
than any other sector or any other
 
07:01:20.468 --> 07:01:20.478 align:start position:0%
industry that is regulated at the local
 
07:01:23.190 --> 07:01:23.200 align:start position:0%
the state and federal level and so right
 
07:01:25.948 --> 07:01:25.958 align:start position:0%
now in current law that power exists for
 
07:01:28.270 --> 07:01:28.280 align:start position:0%
local government and that is why uh we
 
07:01:30.830 --> 07:01:30.840 align:start position:0%
would strongly urge against making such
 
07:01:34.590 --> 07:01:34.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:01:40.270 --> 07:01:40.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:01:42.708 --> 07:01:42.718 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
 
07:01:45.230 --> 07:01:45.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:01:52.150 --> 07:01:52.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:01:55.110 --> 07:01:55.120 align:start position:0%
trelli good afternoon and welcome back
 
07:01:57.670 --> 07:01:57.680 align:start position:0%
to Municipal and County government in
 
07:01:59.510 --> 07:01:59.520 align:start position:0%
quite a day a man of many
 
07:02:02.590 --> 07:02:02.600 align:start position:0%
hats my name is Joe trelli I'm in
 
07:02:07.270 --> 07:02:07.280 align:start position:0%
Hampton New Hampshire and I have become
 
07:02:09.190 --> 07:02:09.200 align:start position:0%
I am not an expert in this but I did
 
07:02:11.910 --> 07:02:11.920 align:start position:0%
manage to get synchronous video and
 
07:02:16.350 --> 07:02:16.360 align:start position:0%
audio from 72 countries back to 30 Rock
 
07:02:18.910 --> 07:02:18.920 align:start position:0%
when I worked for NBC news so I have a
 
07:02:20.830 --> 07:02:20.840 align:start position:0%
little bit of understanding of RF and
 
07:02:22.510 --> 07:02:22.520 align:start position:0%
satellite dishes and
 
07:02:24.948 --> 07:02:24.958 align:start position:0%
microwaves I also live in Hampton and we
 
07:02:26.910 --> 07:02:26.920 align:start position:0%
just had over the last two years a
 
07:02:29.590 --> 07:02:29.600 align:start position:0%
battle with vertex about putting an
 
07:02:29.600 --> 07:02:30.830 align:start position:0%
battle with vertex about putting an
oversized

07:02:30.830 --> 07:02:30.840 align:start position:0%
oversized
 
07:02:35.388 --> 07:02:35.398 align:start position:0%
Tower very close to a Runway our runway
 
07:02:36.548 --> 07:02:36.558 align:start position:0%
in uh in
 
07:02:39.628 --> 07:02:39.638 align:start position:0%
Hampton and so I actually took it upon
 
07:02:41.670 --> 07:02:41.680 align:start position:0%
myself to go out and
 
07:02:44.430 --> 07:02:44.440 align:start position:0%
navigate and representative fra asked a
 
07:02:46.430 --> 07:02:46.440 align:start position:0%
little bit a while ago about doing a
 
07:02:48.670 --> 07:02:48.680 align:start position:0%
PowerPoint and I did PowerPoints for the
 
07:02:52.070 --> 07:02:52.080 align:start position:0%
board of Selectmen that pretty much
 
07:02:55.510 --> 07:02:55.520 align:start position:0%
showed what the alternative is and what
 
07:02:59.070 --> 07:02:59.080 align:start position:0%
uh what vertex was saying I'll hold it
 
07:03:01.350 --> 07:03:01.360 align:start position:0%
up no viable alternative I don't know if
 
07:03:03.590 --> 07:03:03.600 align:start position:0%
the camera can see that so that was the
 
07:03:05.670 --> 07:03:05.680 align:start position:0%
plan that they had and presented to the
 
07:03:08.670 --> 07:03:08.680 align:start position:0%
Selectmen no viable alternative to the
 
07:03:11.788 --> 07:03:11.798 align:start position:0%
zoning board and to the selectman well I
 
07:03:14.830 --> 07:03:14.840 align:start position:0%
disagree we have things that are called
 
07:03:18.190 --> 07:03:18.200 align:start position:0%
canisters made by galtronics that can be
 
07:03:19.948 --> 07:03:19.958 align:start position:0%
limited to
 
07:03:24.510 --> 07:03:24.520 align:start position:0%
LTE which is six gigs and Below versus
 
07:03:30.030 --> 07:03:30.040 align:start position:0%
5G which is 30 gigs up to 300 gigs of
 
07:03:32.628 --> 07:03:32.638 align:start position:0%
microwave high frequency
 
07:03:34.868 --> 07:03:34.878 align:start position:0%
when you go higher frequency you have
 
07:03:36.910 --> 07:03:36.920 align:start position:0%
shorter distance when you have lower
 
07:03:40.270 --> 07:03:40.280 align:start position:0%
frequency you have longer distance so
 
07:03:42.990 --> 07:03:43.000 align:start position:0%
these canisters I will do the little
 
07:03:45.590 --> 07:03:45.600 align:start position:0%
animation here and go through
 
07:03:49.110 --> 07:03:49.120 align:start position:0%
it transmit receive and handoff it's LTE
 
07:03:51.708 --> 07:03:51.718 align:start position:0%
lower power provision provisioned with
 
07:03:53.990 --> 07:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
specific signal pattern so patterns can
 
07:03:57.150 --> 07:03:57.160 align:start position:0%
be Omni directional cardioid and ribbon
 
07:03:59.230 --> 07:03:59.240 align:start position:0%
okay so figure eight so this is the one
 
07:04:02.110 --> 07:04:02.120 align:start position:0%
that's near the tennis court going up
 
07:04:04.030 --> 07:04:04.040 align:start position:0%
from Atlantic Avenue as you're working
 
07:04:06.030 --> 07:04:06.040 align:start position:0%
your way around I guess it's Church
 
07:04:08.788 --> 07:04:08.798 align:start position:0%
Street uh example of ribbon cable ribbon
 
07:04:11.510 --> 07:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
Willow Avenue it's called in Northampton
 
07:04:13.750 --> 07:04:13.760 align:start position:0%
so that's one of them so that one that
 
07:04:15.830 --> 07:04:15.840 align:start position:0%
one's in a ribbon cable so this is the G
 
07:04:17.548 --> 07:04:17.558 align:start position:0%
bottom of the galtronics connector it
 
07:04:19.070 --> 07:04:19.080 align:start position:0%
tells you what the frequencies are that
 
07:04:20.868 --> 07:04:20.878 align:start position:0%
you're plugging in the fiber or whatever
 
07:04:23.468 --> 07:04:23.478 align:start position:0%
it is to do that and this one is on
 
07:04:26.430 --> 07:04:26.440 align:start position:0%
Atlantic Avenue and M Road I live on
 
07:04:29.548 --> 07:04:29.558 align:start position:0%
Woodland so Woodland goes straight up
 
07:04:33.750 --> 07:04:33.760 align:start position:0%
once I get up to the Pond I have
 
07:04:36.110 --> 07:04:36.120 align:start position:0%
uninterrupted service all the way into
 
07:04:38.750 --> 07:04:38.760 align:start position:0%
Rye because we have several of these we
 
07:04:41.110 --> 07:04:41.120 align:start position:0%
have eight of these in our area and I'm
 
07:04:44.388 --> 07:04:44.398 align:start position:0%
going to skip over to the uh to my map
 
07:04:48.110 --> 07:04:48.120 align:start position:0%
because I did radians I did radius I did
 
07:04:49.670 --> 07:04:49.680 align:start position:0%
all kinds of stuff so let's scroll up
 
07:04:53.070 --> 07:04:53.080 align:start position:0%
here and I will show you the map and
 
07:04:55.670 --> 07:04:55.680 align:start position:0%
this doesn't look as good as it does as
 
07:04:57.388 --> 07:04:57.398 align:start position:0%
it would if this was full screen but
 
07:05:00.868 --> 07:05:00.878 align:start position:0%
that's effectively Northern Hampton into
 
07:05:03.190 --> 07:05:03.200 align:start position:0%
Southern North Hampton and that's where
 
07:05:04.868 --> 07:05:04.878 align:start position:0%
all of these canisters are mounted at
 
07:05:08.310 --> 07:05:08.320 align:start position:0%
the top of the utility pole okay so I'm
 
07:05:13.110 --> 07:05:13.120 align:start position:0%
showing a 25 uh uh quarter mile radius
 
07:05:14.948 --> 07:05:14.958 align:start position:0%
with the little blue marks and there's
 
07:05:18.270 --> 07:05:18.280 align:start position:0%
not a lot of overlap it's LTE longer
 
07:05:21.110 --> 07:05:21.120 align:start position:0%
distance you provision it with LTE you
 
07:05:22.830 --> 07:05:22.840 align:start position:0%
boost the power a little bit and you go
 
07:05:24.990 --> 07:05:25.000 align:start position:0%
to a half a mile and I don't know if you
 
07:05:27.310 --> 07:05:27.320 align:start position:0%
can see this but the red the red crosses
 
07:05:30.150 --> 07:05:30.160 align:start position:0%
over pretty much all of the area so
 
07:05:33.070 --> 07:05:33.080 align:start position:0%
these have been installed TNT is the one
 
07:05:34.788 --> 07:05:34.798 align:start position:0%
that I am pretty sure has done it I can
 
07:05:36.468 --> 07:05:36.478 align:start position:0%
watch the signal strength go up on my
 
07:05:39.350 --> 07:05:39.360 align:start position:0%
regular phone watch it drop off as I get
 
07:05:41.990 --> 07:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
closer at to the range the range
 
07:05:44.270 --> 07:05:44.280 align:start position:0%
limitation and then it picks up again
 
07:05:45.750 --> 07:05:45.760 align:start position:0%
which is what it's supposed to do and
 
07:05:48.948 --> 07:05:48.958 align:start position:0%
that's what handoffs do so I don't want
 
07:05:51.670 --> 07:05:51.680 align:start position:0%
Towers I think 5G is pretty much old
 
07:05:53.590 --> 07:05:53.600 align:start position:0%
already as we get into technology and
 
07:05:54.990 --> 07:05:55.000 align:start position:0%
things are starting to move a little bit
 
07:05:57.910 --> 07:05:57.920 align:start position:0%
faster with with what Comcast is doing
 
07:05:59.750 --> 07:05:59.760 align:start position:0%
with their little cylinders that are
 
07:06:02.230 --> 07:06:02.240 align:start position:0%
hanging between the utility point s that
 
07:06:04.150 --> 07:06:04.160 align:start position:0%
are effectively neighborhood Wi-Fi is
 
07:06:06.670 --> 07:06:06.680 align:start position:0%
what they called it in 2013 when they
 
07:06:08.990 --> 07:06:09.000 align:start position:0%
started doing that so when you drive
 
07:06:11.510 --> 07:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
around you're going to see a a like a
 
07:06:13.788 --> 07:06:13.798 align:start position:0%
cylinder hanging from the utility wire
 
07:06:16.270 --> 07:06:16.280 align:start position:0%
the cable and a bunch of cables goes in
 
07:06:18.350 --> 07:06:18.360 align:start position:0%
on one side that's effectively a big
 
07:06:21.750 --> 07:06:21.760 align:start position:0%
Wi-Fi so I'm going to wrap it up and I
 
07:06:24.548 --> 07:06:24.558 align:start position:0%
said four minutes I'm at
 
07:06:28.310 --> 07:06:28.320 align:start position:0%
4:15 thank you Mr trelli questions for
 
07:06:28.320 --> 07:06:29.750 align:start position:0%
4:15 thank you Mr trelli questions for
the

07:06:29.750 --> 07:06:29.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
07:06:32.548 --> 07:06:32.558 align:start position:0%
speaker seeing none thank you thank you
 
07:06:32.558 --> 07:06:34.270 align:start position:0%
speaker seeing none thank you thank you
very

07:06:34.270 --> 07:06:34.280 align:start position:0%
very
 
07:06:48.670 --> 07:06:48.680 align:start position:0%
 
07:06:51.310 --> 07:06:51.320 align:start position:0%
Thatcher good afternoon sir and welcome
 
07:06:53.350 --> 07:06:53.360 align:start position:0%
to Municipal and County government thank
 
07:06:55.190 --> 07:06:55.200 align:start position:0%
you uh Madam chair members of the
 
07:06:57.430 --> 07:06:57.440 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Andrew Thatcher and
 
07:06:59.350 --> 07:06:59.360 align:start position:0%
I'm here at the request of
 
07:07:02.670 --> 07:07:02.680 align:start position:0%
ctia and I am also in opposition to the
 
07:07:05.590 --> 07:07:05.600 align:start position:0%
bill I just submitted written testimony
 
07:07:07.830 --> 07:07:07.840 align:start position:0%
but I'd actually like to jump straight
 
07:07:10.310 --> 07:07:10.320 align:start position:0%
to his question and comment and just
 
07:07:13.150 --> 07:07:13.160 align:start position:0%
kind of work through a little bit better
 
07:07:15.548 --> 07:07:15.558 align:start position:0%
exactly what 5G is so we all understand
 
07:07:18.468 --> 07:07:18.478 align:start position:0%
the playing field we're talking about so
 
07:07:20.548 --> 07:07:20.558 align:start position:0%
fifth generation Evolution what we're
 
07:07:22.788 --> 07:07:22.798 align:start position:0%
talking about as opposed to 2G
 
07:07:26.830 --> 07:07:26.840 align:start position:0%
4G or 3G what have you covers a number
 
07:07:29.388 --> 07:07:29.398 align:start position:0%
of different frequency bands 600
 
07:07:35.628 --> 07:07:35.638 align:start position:0%
megahertz 800 2 .5 GHz 3.5 GHz 5.5 GHz
 
07:07:39.070 --> 07:07:39.080 align:start position:0%
are the line and share of what 5G is
 
07:07:41.750 --> 07:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
that's what's being deployed just about
 
07:07:44.310 --> 07:07:44.320 align:start position:0%
everywhere and those
 
07:07:46.948 --> 07:07:46.958 align:start position:0%
frequencies as far as biologically are
 
07:07:50.948 --> 07:07:50.958 align:start position:0%
no different than the 4G and 3G or UHF
 
07:07:54.150 --> 07:07:54.160 align:start position:0%
for that we've used in TV Etc so those
 
07:07:56.110 --> 07:07:56.120 align:start position:0%
frequencies have been around a very very
 
07:07:58.948 --> 07:07:58.958 align:start position:0%
long time and fundamentally
 
07:08:01.590 --> 07:08:01.600 align:start position:0%
biophysically they're no different than
 
07:08:03.670 --> 07:08:03.680 align:start position:0%
and than everything that we're used to
 
07:08:06.670 --> 07:08:06.680 align:start position:0%
so at least in the state of New
 
07:08:09.270 --> 07:08:09.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I think a lot of the concern
 
07:08:12.230 --> 07:08:12.240 align:start position:0%
with 5G people immediately jump to a
 
07:08:14.430 --> 07:08:14.440 align:start position:0%
higher frequency the millimeter waves
 
07:08:17.670 --> 07:08:17.680 align:start position:0%
which can be at least in use in the US
 
07:08:22.670 --> 07:08:22.680 align:start position:0%
can be 24 28 gahz 37 39 gigahertz
 
07:08:24.788 --> 07:08:24.798 align:start position:0%
there's some higher frequency bands that
 
07:08:27.628 --> 07:08:27.638 align:start position:0%
are being developed but they're not in
 
07:08:30.468 --> 07:08:30.478 align:start position:0%
use yet so 37 gigahertz is about as high
 
07:08:33.868 --> 07:08:33.878 align:start position:0%
as we get most of the concern really
 
07:08:36.388 --> 07:08:36.398 align:start position:0%
seems to be about these millimeter waves
 
07:08:38.468 --> 07:08:38.478 align:start position:0%
the higher frequencies of
 
07:08:41.110 --> 07:08:41.120 align:start position:0%
which uh usually are only used in high
 
07:08:43.548 --> 07:08:43.558 align:start position:0%
density population districts like uh
 
07:08:45.948 --> 07:08:45.958 align:start position:0%
like Boston or New York or something
 
07:08:47.548 --> 07:08:47.558 align:start position:0%
like that is where you're going to see
 
07:08:49.548 --> 07:08:49.558 align:start position:0%
those there's a possibility in New
 
07:08:51.830 --> 07:08:51.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I would say so I would never
 
07:08:53.948 --> 07:08:53.958 align:start position:0%
rule it out but maybe in a big
 
07:08:57.388 --> 07:08:57.398 align:start position:0%
university you might want a little bit
 
07:08:59.948 --> 07:08:59.958 align:start position:0%
of that in the campus Because you've
 
07:09:02.548 --> 07:09:02.558 align:start position:0%
just got too many people um but by and
 
07:09:04.948 --> 07:09:04.958 align:start position:0%
large most of that as the gentleman
 
07:09:07.670 --> 07:09:07.680 align:start position:0%
before me had mentioned is handled by
 
07:09:09.628 --> 07:09:09.638 align:start position:0%
the small cells that's typically done
 
07:09:12.788 --> 07:09:12.798 align:start position:0%
and they do use 5G but it could be for
 
07:09:16.190 --> 07:09:16.200 align:start position:0%
AT&amp;T it's going to be like 3.5 GHz I
 
07:09:19.150 --> 07:09:19.160 align:start position:0%
mean Wii networks even in my own house
 
07:09:23.468 --> 07:09:23.478 align:start position:0%
use 2.4 and 5.5 GHz so these are not
 
07:09:25.430 --> 07:09:25.440 align:start position:0%
frequencies that we're not unfamiliar
 
07:09:29.750 --> 07:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
with um going to the 5G millimeter wave
 
07:09:31.510 --> 07:09:31.520 align:start position:0%
just talking about the physics for the
 
07:09:33.388 --> 07:09:33.398 align:start position:0%
that uh those
 
07:09:36.708 --> 07:09:36.718 align:start position:0%
antennas are amazingly tiny so you may
 
07:09:40.030 --> 07:09:40.040 align:start position:0%
have an antenna panel that's about this
 
07:09:43.190 --> 07:09:43.200 align:start position:0%
big and it could have 128 antennas on
 
07:09:45.628 --> 07:09:45.638 align:start position:0%
there that are all about that big they
 
07:09:48.190 --> 07:09:48.200 align:start position:0%
put out about a tenth of a watt so
 
07:09:51.430 --> 07:09:51.440 align:start position:0%
diminishingly small energy only because
 
07:09:53.270 --> 07:09:53.280 align:start position:0%
as opposed to a traditional antenna
 
07:09:55.548 --> 07:09:55.558 align:start position:0%
which is just broadcasting
 
07:09:57.788 --> 07:09:57.798 align:start position:0%
uniformly you're you get one if you're
 
07:09:59.868 --> 07:09:59.878 align:start position:0%
in use and you're using a phone that
 
07:10:02.430 --> 07:10:02.440 align:start position:0%
antenna would be direct directed toward
 
07:10:05.548 --> 07:10:05.558 align:start position:0%
you and you only so if there was someone
 
07:10:07.670 --> 07:10:07.680 align:start position:0%
right next to you okay they might get an
 
07:10:09.750 --> 07:10:09.760 align:start position:0%
exposure but it's exceedingly small but
 
07:10:11.830 --> 07:10:11.840 align:start position:0%
if any further distance away you're not
 
07:10:14.628 --> 07:10:14.638 align:start position:0%
getting any exposure at all so from
 
07:10:16.510 --> 07:10:16.520 align:start position:0%
someone who does measurements and does
 
07:10:19.670 --> 07:10:19.680 align:start position:0%
analysis for a living from all of the
 
07:10:22.548 --> 07:10:22.558 align:start position:0%
antennas be rooftops or what have you
 
07:10:25.670 --> 07:10:25.680 align:start position:0%
the 5G millimeter wave contribution is
 
07:10:28.868 --> 07:10:28.878 align:start position:0%
diminishingly small so we've got very
 
07:10:31.548 --> 07:10:31.558 align:start position:0%
little power from those millimeter waves
 
07:10:34.388 --> 07:10:34.398 align:start position:0%
the attenuation because the the
 
07:10:37.030 --> 07:10:37.040 align:start position:0%
frequency is so high it actually doesn't
 
07:10:39.430 --> 07:10:39.440 align:start position:0%
penetrate the outer layer of the skin
 
07:10:42.948 --> 07:10:42.958 align:start position:0%
that's it so we're worried about or
 
07:10:44.948 --> 07:10:44.958 align:start position:0%
people worried about gosh I'm worried
 
07:10:46.948 --> 07:10:46.958 align:start position:0%
about adverse health effects and I will
 
07:10:49.388 --> 07:10:49.398 align:start position:0%
admit there's not a ton of information
 
07:10:51.468 --> 07:10:51.478 align:start position:0%
or science on studies on the higher
 
07:10:53.670 --> 07:10:53.680 align:start position:0%
millimeter waves there's quite a bit but
 
07:10:55.590 --> 07:10:55.600 align:start position:0%
not as much as what we have for
 
07:10:57.948 --> 07:10:57.958 align:start position:0%
everything else but from a physics
 
07:11:00.468 --> 07:11:00.478 align:start position:0%
standpoint there really is no reason for
 
07:11:02.030 --> 07:11:02.040 align:start position:0%
us to think
 
07:11:04.670 --> 07:11:04.680 align:start position:0%
that there could be a mechanism for
 
07:11:06.310 --> 07:11:06.320 align:start position:0%
which harm could happened because we're
 
07:11:08.750 --> 07:11:08.760 align:start position:0%
limited to the skin and the eyes for
 
07:11:11.628 --> 07:11:11.638 align:start position:0%
those and the basis of the standards is
 
07:11:15.070 --> 07:11:15.080 align:start position:0%
limiting tissue Heating and the heating
 
07:11:17.948 --> 07:11:17.958 align:start position:0%
over the last 70 years is the only known
 
07:11:21.510 --> 07:11:21.520 align:start position:0%
mechanism of harm it's just pure energy
 
07:11:25.270 --> 07:11:25.280 align:start position:0%
where and how you mod modulate a 5G or
 
07:11:27.310 --> 07:11:27.320 align:start position:0%
4G signal or something really doesn't
 
07:11:29.468 --> 07:11:29.478 align:start position:0%
matter to the cellular level because
 
07:11:31.670 --> 07:11:31.680 align:start position:0%
it's just pure physics it's just pure
 
07:11:35.670 --> 07:11:35.680 align:start position:0%
energy so uh as opposed to Jumping
 
07:11:38.110 --> 07:11:38.120 align:start position:0%
further into it I just was kind of
 
07:11:40.070 --> 07:11:40.080 align:start position:0%
trying to lay out the groundwork for
 
07:11:42.990 --> 07:11:43.000 align:start position:0%
what 5G why millimeter
 
07:11:45.628 --> 07:11:45.638 align:start position:0%
waves I mean they're new but I mean in
 
07:11:47.910 --> 07:11:47.920 align:start position:0%
the big picture in the 70s I can
 
07:11:50.868 --> 07:11:50.878 align:start position:0%
remember that uh microwave ovens holy
 
07:11:52.910 --> 07:11:52.920 align:start position:0%
cow we're putting cancer boxes in our
 
07:11:54.788 --> 07:11:54.798 align:start position:0%
kitchens and No One Believes that
 
07:11:58.230 --> 07:11:58.240 align:start position:0%
anymore in the '90s and early 2000s I
 
07:12:00.070 --> 07:12:00.080 align:start position:0%
was RF expert for the state of
 
07:12:03.750 --> 07:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
Washington for 20 years um and uh the
 
07:12:06.310 --> 07:12:06.320 align:start position:0%
big concern of course was uh these could
 
07:12:09.868 --> 07:12:09.878 align:start position:0%
cause cancer but as a physicist I that
 
07:12:12.788 --> 07:12:12.798 align:start position:0%
was pretty easy to find out but we have
 
07:12:14.468 --> 07:12:14.478 align:start position:0%
a tremendous amount of information to
 
07:12:16.310 --> 07:12:16.320 align:start position:0%
now show that of course it doesn't cause
 
07:12:18.990 --> 07:12:19.000 align:start position:0%
cancer and we have the human St studies
 
07:12:21.948 --> 07:12:21.958 align:start position:0%
to back that up and I'm done I guess so
 
07:12:23.430 --> 07:12:23.440 align:start position:0%
I'll open up for questions thanks for
 
07:12:25.948 --> 07:12:25.958 align:start position:0%
your time thank you Mr thater questions
 
07:12:31.230 --> 07:12:31.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:12:33.430 --> 07:12:33.440 align:start position:0%
oh representative frock has a question
 
07:12:36.670 --> 07:12:36.680 align:start position:0%
raise your hand higher not just a
 
07:12:40.150 --> 07:12:40.160 align:start position:0%
finger thank you madam chair uh Mr
 
07:12:42.708 --> 07:12:42.718 align:start position:0%
Thatcher my question may be uh a little
 
07:12:44.868 --> 07:12:44.878 align:start position:0%
out of your area of
 
07:12:47.910 --> 07:12:47.920 align:start position:0%
expertise but I'm I'm intrigued what the
 
07:12:52.868 --> 07:12:52.878 align:start position:0%
previous speaker Mr Chelli um informed
 
07:12:57.948 --> 07:12:57.958 align:start position:0%
us about uh these cans on utility polls
 
07:13:02.788 --> 07:13:02.798 align:start position:0%
as an alternative to Towers now now we
 
07:13:05.948 --> 07:13:05.958 align:start position:0%
in my town uh couple of years ago we
 
07:13:09.548 --> 07:13:09.558 align:start position:0%
permitted a tower for it was either
 
07:13:11.708 --> 07:13:11.718 align:start position:0%
three or four different
 
07:13:14.510 --> 07:13:14.520 align:start position:0%
carriers my question
 
07:13:18.150 --> 07:13:18.160 align:start position:0%
is do the do these
 
07:13:22.030 --> 07:13:22.040 align:start position:0%
cans uh have the ability to carry
 
07:13:25.350 --> 07:13:25.360 align:start position:0%
signals for multiple carriers or are
 
07:13:29.150 --> 07:13:29.160 align:start position:0%
they limited to single carriers that's a
 
07:13:31.430 --> 07:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
great question typically and I work for
 
07:13:33.750 --> 07:13:33.760 align:start position:0%
a lot of utilities for implementation of
 
07:13:35.350 --> 07:13:35.360 align:start position:0%
these cuz you can imagine they're on
 
07:13:37.350 --> 07:13:37.360 align:start position:0%
light poles or power poles or what have
 
07:13:40.670 --> 07:13:40.680 align:start position:0%
you um buy a general rule most utilities
 
07:13:43.350 --> 07:13:43.360 align:start position:0%
limit one carrier per pole so if you
 
07:13:46.548 --> 07:13:46.558 align:start position:0%
want to do small sales is what they're
 
07:13:49.190 --> 07:13:49.200 align:start position:0%
called in a different neighborhood pick
 
07:13:51.708 --> 07:13:51.718 align:start position:0%
a different poll so typically speaking
 
07:13:53.468 --> 07:13:53.478 align:start position:0%
you're only going to have and if there's
 
07:13:55.910 --> 07:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
one antenna or one canister that can
 
07:13:58.270 --> 07:13:58.280 align:start position:0%
only be one carrier because they're
 
07:13:59.830 --> 07:13:59.840 align:start position:0%
they're broadcasting out on their
 
07:14:01.830 --> 07:14:01.840 align:start position:0%
allowed channels so you'd have to have
 
07:14:03.990 --> 07:14:04.000 align:start position:0%
another antenna and there would be a
 
07:14:05.990 --> 07:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
little bit of Separation but generally
 
07:14:08.350 --> 07:14:08.360 align:start position:0%
speaking for small cells it's one for
 
07:14:10.030 --> 07:14:10.040 align:start position:0%
one because there's plenty of lights or
 
07:14:11.708 --> 07:14:11.718 align:start position:0%
there's plenty of power poles you can go
 
07:14:15.708 --> 07:14:15.718 align:start position:0%
somewhere else so does that answer it it
 
07:14:18.190 --> 07:14:18.200 align:start position:0%
does I I have a followup Madam chair
 
07:14:21.830 --> 07:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
will allow yes I'll allow
 
07:14:28.388 --> 07:14:28.398 align:start position:0%
um can you compare the cost of r a rural
 
07:14:32.030 --> 07:14:32.040 align:start position:0%
deployment of service in a
 
07:14:36.948 --> 07:14:36.958 align:start position:0%
hypothetical let's say 10 m square area
 
07:14:42.230 --> 07:14:42.240 align:start position:0%
using a single Tower versus these cans
 
07:14:45.670 --> 07:14:45.680 align:start position:0%
which is more cost effective I'm
 
07:14:47.590 --> 07:14:47.600 align:start position:0%
definitely not the cost person but what
 
07:14:50.910 --> 07:14:50.920 align:start position:0%
I basically it comes down to efficiency
 
07:14:53.910 --> 07:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
if you have one tower for this large
 
07:14:56.868 --> 07:14:56.878 align:start position:0%
area there's only so many callers it can
 
07:14:59.750 --> 07:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
handle so much data it can handle so
 
07:15:03.350 --> 07:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
they end up having to deploy more more
 
07:15:05.990 --> 07:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
areas locally in order to to cover to
 
07:15:07.830 --> 07:15:07.840 align:start position:0%
make sure we get the coverage as Jeremy
 
07:15:10.150 --> 07:15:10.160 align:start position:0%
mentioned the use is going up quite a
 
07:15:12.708 --> 07:15:12.718 align:start position:0%
bit so typically what's that's what's
 
07:15:15.948 --> 07:15:15.958 align:start position:0%
going on and and as far as exposures Go
 
07:15:18.350 --> 07:15:18.360 align:start position:0%
I mean I've been doing survey since the
 
07:15:21.190 --> 07:15:21.200 align:start position:0%
90s uh and the background radio
 
07:15:23.590 --> 07:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
frequency background basically really
 
07:15:26.350 --> 07:15:26.360 align:start position:0%
hasn't changed since the 80s or 90s it
 
07:15:29.230 --> 07:15:29.240 align:start position:0%
basically stays the same uh as we get
 
07:15:31.230 --> 07:15:31.240 align:start position:0%
more densification
 
07:15:33.708 --> 07:15:33.718 align:start position:0%
uh the power levels and overall
 
07:15:35.628 --> 07:15:35.638 align:start position:0%
background tends to go down because they
 
07:15:38.070 --> 07:15:38.080 align:start position:0%
can't broadcast that further than just
 
07:15:39.948 --> 07:15:39.958 align:start position:0%
the area they're trying to cover
 
07:15:43.350 --> 07:15:43.360 align:start position:0%
otherwise they lose efficiencies in the
 
07:15:46.708 --> 07:15:46.718 align:start position:0%
design further questions representative
 
07:15:48.708 --> 07:15:48.718 align:start position:0%
Dolan has a question thank you madam
 
07:15:50.110 --> 07:15:50.120 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
07:15:53.310 --> 07:15:53.320 align:start position:0%
question my question is into your uh
 
07:15:57.430 --> 07:15:57.440 align:start position:0%
expertise of physics SL Electronics
 
07:15:59.350 --> 07:15:59.360 align:start position:0%
often times
 
07:16:03.350 --> 07:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
communities uh get a tower and the fire
 
07:16:05.670 --> 07:16:05.680 align:start position:0%
department says hey can I put my antenna
 
07:16:07.548 --> 07:16:07.558 align:start position:0%
on the tower and then the police
 
07:16:10.110 --> 07:16:10.120 align:start position:0%
department says I want to put one up two
 
07:16:13.788 --> 07:16:13.798 align:start position:0%
and then and then you've got different
 
07:16:15.948 --> 07:16:15.958 align:start position:0%
Technologies uh at probably at different
 
07:16:19.468 --> 07:16:19.478 align:start position:0%
frequencies can you comment on any uh
 
07:16:24.468 --> 07:16:24.478 align:start position:0%
stacking of frequencies or right or um I
 
07:16:27.350 --> 07:16:27.360 align:start position:0%
do a lot of that work actually for the
 
07:16:29.510 --> 07:16:29.520 align:start position:0%
the utilities fire departments Etc so
 
07:16:31.510 --> 07:16:31.520 align:start position:0%
I'm very familiar in fact I've got two
 
07:16:33.590 --> 07:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
on my desk doing projects towers that
 
07:16:36.030 --> 07:16:36.040 align:start position:0%
include everybody typically the fire
 
07:16:38.628 --> 07:16:38.638 align:start position:0%
department uh police stations Etc are
 
07:16:41.708 --> 07:16:41.718 align:start position:0%
using more like a 400 megahertz or 500
 
07:16:44.510 --> 07:16:44.520 align:start position:0%
MHz that's that's typically a frequency
 
07:16:47.110 --> 07:16:47.120 align:start position:0%
you're going to use if we're using like
 
07:16:48.910 --> 07:16:48.920 align:start position:0%
you say push to talk or handheld
 
07:16:50.948 --> 07:16:50.958 align:start position:0%
walkie-talkie or something like that
 
07:16:55.150 --> 07:16:55.160 align:start position:0%
that's that's typically common um all of
 
07:16:57.468 --> 07:16:57.478 align:start position:0%
the antennas I don't care who makes them
 
07:16:59.788 --> 07:16:59.798 align:start position:0%
are required to go through FCC
 
07:17:02.030 --> 07:17:02.040 align:start position:0%
verification and Val validation and that
 
07:17:04.310 --> 07:17:04.320 align:start position:0%
is to make sure that if this is your
 
07:17:07.030 --> 07:17:07.040 align:start position:0%
bandwidth you know 10 to 15 mahz or
 
07:17:09.868 --> 07:17:09.878 align:start position:0%
whatever it is you don't exceed that you
 
07:17:12.468 --> 07:17:12.478 align:start position:0%
don't spill over into something else so
 
07:17:16.230 --> 07:17:16.240 align:start position:0%
so yes they can all I I do Towers where
 
07:17:18.310 --> 07:17:18.320 align:start position:0%
there's there's eight or 10 different
 
07:17:20.948 --> 07:17:20.958 align:start position:0%
sites on it if it's big enough uh and
 
07:17:23.030 --> 07:17:23.040 align:start position:0%
they'll have a lot of different carriers
 
07:17:25.548 --> 07:17:25.558 align:start position:0%
and a lot of different uses typically
 
07:17:27.590 --> 07:17:27.600 align:start position:0%
speaking those fire departments or the
 
07:17:31.388 --> 07:17:31.398 align:start position:0%
police and radio Etc don't have a lot of
 
07:17:33.468 --> 07:17:33.478 align:start position:0%
the duty cycle is much smaller meaning
 
07:17:35.948 --> 07:17:35.958 align:start position:0%
you're not having constant transmission
 
07:17:38.628 --> 07:17:38.638 align:start position:0%
you're having individual intermittent so
 
07:17:42.910 --> 07:17:42.920 align:start position:0%
it tends to not be 100% transmission so
 
07:17:44.910 --> 07:17:44.920 align:start position:0%
you back further
 
07:17:47.350 --> 07:17:47.360 align:start position:0%
questions had a quick question so with
 
07:17:50.310 --> 07:17:50.320 align:start position:0%
regards to the 5G millimeter
 
07:17:53.430 --> 07:17:53.440 align:start position:0%
wavelengths you in your testimony stated
 
07:17:55.510 --> 07:17:55.520 align:start position:0%
that um there's no evidence that it
 
07:17:59.590 --> 07:17:59.600 align:start position:0%
causes heating o of the skin and I don't
 
07:18:01.468 --> 07:18:01.478 align:start position:0%
think I said that oh no I said That's
 
07:18:03.468 --> 07:18:03.478 align:start position:0%
the basis of the standard is the tissue
 
07:18:05.830 --> 07:18:05.840 align:start position:0%
heating so as long as we're less than
 
07:18:08.150 --> 07:18:08.160 align:start position:0%
the limits we won't cause that tissue
 
07:18:11.948 --> 07:18:11.958 align:start position:0%
heating so okay so what I was trying to
 
07:18:14.110 --> 07:18:14.120 align:start position:0%
understand so I misunderstood what you
 
07:18:15.830 --> 07:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
had said but what I was trying to
 
07:18:17.868 --> 07:18:17.878 align:start position:0%
understand is do we know if there's any
 
07:18:20.830 --> 07:18:20.840 align:start position:0%
evidence that that there's at the
 
07:18:23.910 --> 07:18:23.920 align:start position:0%
cellular level with regards to bonds
 
07:18:29.150 --> 07:18:29.160 align:start position:0%
like for example DNA RNA can can the
 
07:18:31.910 --> 07:18:31.920 align:start position:0%
electromagnetic energy affect th those
 
07:18:35.070 --> 07:18:35.080 align:start position:0%
bonds at that very small cellular level
 
07:18:36.990 --> 07:18:37.000 align:start position:0%
of thank you for that question I
 
07:18:39.110 --> 07:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
probably meant to mention that and that
 
07:18:41.910 --> 07:18:41.920 align:start position:0%
here in front of you I I forget
 
07:18:45.910 --> 07:18:45.920 align:start position:0%
so ultraviolet light about 10 Electro
 
07:18:48.310 --> 07:18:48.320 align:start position:0%
electron volts is the minimum energy
 
07:18:51.830 --> 07:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
necessary to cause DNA strand breakage
 
07:18:55.350 --> 07:18:55.360 align:start position:0%
or damage uh everybody knows about skin
 
07:18:57.708 --> 07:18:57.718 align:start position:0%
cancer etc etc really what's going on in
 
07:18:58.910 --> 07:18:58.920 align:start position:0%
the DNA
 
07:19:01.388 --> 07:19:01.398 align:start position:0%
strand following an exp exposure you can
 
07:19:03.388 --> 07:19:03.398 align:start position:0%
get a stickiness and you could have a
 
07:19:05.830 --> 07:19:05.840 align:start position:0%
thing called like a thyine dier where
 
07:19:07.868 --> 07:19:07.878 align:start position:0%
two strands would stick together and if
 
07:19:10.510 --> 07:19:10.520 align:start position:0%
you're trying to replicate well you
 
07:19:13.350 --> 07:19:13.360 align:start position:0%
could have a misrep so that's that's
 
07:19:16.430 --> 07:19:16.440 align:start position:0%
really the minimum energy by which this
 
07:19:18.510 --> 07:19:18.520 align:start position:0%
genetic damage that you speak of Could
 
07:19:20.708 --> 07:19:20.718 align:start position:0%
Happen uh these millimeter waves were
 
07:19:24.708 --> 07:19:24.718 align:start position:0%
about a 100,000 times less than that so
 
07:19:27.190 --> 07:19:27.200 align:start position:0%
I don't care how much power you're using
 
07:19:29.190 --> 07:19:29.200 align:start position:0%
you're not going to cause genetic damage
 
07:19:31.150 --> 07:19:31.160 align:start position:0%
what you can could do especially if it's
 
07:19:32.990 --> 07:19:33.000 align:start position:0%
a millimeter wave and it were high
 
07:19:35.510 --> 07:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
enough intensity you could get an athema
 
07:19:38.030 --> 07:19:38.040 align:start position:0%
A skin rening right your skin got hot or
 
07:19:41.350 --> 07:19:41.360 align:start position:0%
something because of an intense exposure
 
07:19:41.360 --> 07:19:42.388 align:start position:0%
something because of an intense exposure
but

07:19:42.388 --> 07:19:42.398 align:start position:0%
but
 
07:19:45.350 --> 07:19:45.360 align:start position:0%
again we we're nowhere near the
 
07:19:47.350 --> 07:19:47.360 align:start position:0%
proximity and I do a lot of rooftop work
 
07:19:49.788 --> 07:19:49.798 align:start position:0%
so that's predominantly where I am but
 
07:19:52.150 --> 07:19:52.160 align:start position:0%
um you're just as long as we're less
 
07:19:53.868 --> 07:19:53.878 align:start position:0%
than those standards we're not going to
 
07:19:56.468 --> 07:19:56.478 align:start position:0%
even get an athema because that would be
 
07:19:58.350 --> 07:19:58.360 align:start position:0%
a really high exposure to be honest with
 
07:20:00.948 --> 07:20:00.958 align:start position:0%
you but even then move your hand away
 
07:20:03.190 --> 07:20:03.200 align:start position:0%
back away for a few minutes and your
 
07:20:05.788 --> 07:20:05.798 align:start position:0%
blood flow and radiative heat loss Will
 
07:20:08.030 --> 07:20:08.040 align:start position:0%
Will dissipate that
 
07:20:11.030 --> 07:20:11.040 align:start position:0%
energy did that help yes it did thank
 
07:20:12.670 --> 07:20:12.680 align:start position:0%
you further
 
07:20:14.948 --> 07:20:14.958 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you
 
07:20:16.708 --> 07:20:16.718 align:start position:0%
appreciate your time thank
 
07:20:19.670 --> 07:20:19.680 align:start position:0%
you next the chair recognizes Miss

Municipal and County government good
 
07:20:30.830 --> 07:20:30.840 align:start position:0%
afternoon honorable members of the
 
07:20:32.670 --> 07:20:32.680 align:start position:0%
municipal and County government
 
07:20:34.670 --> 07:20:34.680 align:start position:0%

07:20:36.548 --> 07:20:36.558 align:start position:0%
Bernardo and I'm a resident of Franklin
 
07:20:39.548 --> 07:20:39.558 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and I would like to talk
 
07:20:40.670 --> 07:20:40.680 align:start position:0%
about the
 
07:20:45.510 --> 07:20:45.520 align:start position:0%
harms of the 5G in our community the New
 
07:20:47.830 --> 07:20:47.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire 5G report that was funded by
 
07:20:50.510 --> 07:20:50.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire tax dollars nearly 5 years
 
07:20:53.350 --> 07:20:53.360 align:start position:0%
ago was a breaking document and I
 
07:20:56.628 --> 07:20:56.638 align:start position:0%
support HB 51 because I believe for the
 
07:20:58.788 --> 07:20:58.798 align:start position:0%
sake of New Hampshire's public health
 
07:21:01.910 --> 07:21:01.920 align:start position:0%
and environment we need to re visit that
 
07:21:04.750 --> 07:21:04.760 align:start position:0%
document and execute its recommendations
 
07:21:09.468 --> 07:21:09.478 align:start position:0%
currently under RSA 12- K10 IV it states
 
07:21:11.910 --> 07:21:11.920 align:start position:0%
that an authority may not mandate
 
07:21:14.310 --> 07:21:14.320 align:start position:0%

utility
 
07:21:32.750 --> 07:21:32.760 align:start position:0%
poles this is a massive oversight and
 
07:21:35.150 --> 07:21:35.160 align:start position:0%
encourages the Telecom industry to
 
07:21:37.990 --> 07:21:38.000 align:start position:0%
install these personal wireless service
 
07:21:39.788 --> 07:21:39.798 align:start position:0%

07:21:42.190 --> 07:21:42.200 align:start position:0%
is no permit or public discourse
 
07:21:45.230 --> 07:21:45.240 align:start position:0%
required prior to their placement it is
 
07:21:47.708 --> 07:21:47.718 align:start position:0%
imperative that Authority is restored to

we LED efforts to defeat flawed bills
 
07:22:59.510 --> 07:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
the last three years that sought to
 
07:23:01.190 --> 07:23:01.200 align:start position:0%
unreasonably rest strict Wireless
 
07:23:03.430 --> 07:23:03.440 align:start position:0%
telecommunications in New Hampshire
 
07:23:05.510 --> 07:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
because it's critical to Residents
 
07:23:07.910 --> 07:23:07.920 align:start position:0%
businesses first uh responders and the
 
07:23:11.350 --> 07:23:11.360 align:start position:0%
state economy allowing municipalities to
 
07:23:13.510 --> 07:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
decline 5G Towers would increase the
 
07:23:15.990 --> 07:23:16.000 align:start position:0%
risk of running a file of the federal
 
07:23:18.110 --> 07:23:18.120 align:start position:0%
Telecommunications Act specifically
 
07:23:22.628 --> 07:23:22.638 align:start position:0%
section 704 in multiple areas HB 501
 
07:23:24.628 --> 07:23:24.638 align:start position:0%
would also repeal the New Hampshire law
 
07:23:28.510 --> 07:23:28.520 align:start position:0%
rsk RSA 12K regarding personal wireless
 
07:23:31.388 --> 07:23:31.398 align:start position:0%
service facilities the this law promotes
 
07:23:33.030 --> 07:23:33.040 align:start position:0%
smaller alternatives to the taller
 
07:23:35.430 --> 07:23:35.440 align:start position:0%
cellular towers and it's critical
 
07:23:38.510 --> 07:23:38.520 align:start position:0%
ensuring First Responders are able to
 
07:23:41.350 --> 07:23:41.360 align:start position:0%
collocate antennas on towers for
 
07:23:43.308 --> 07:23:43.318 align:start position:0%
wireless emergency
 
07:23:45.628 --> 07:23:45.638 align:start position:0%
communications municipalities already
 
07:23:49.388 --> 07:23:49.398 align:start position:0%
have sign significant ability to uh site
 
07:23:52.670 --> 07:23:52.680 align:start position:0%
personal Wireless facilities and Towers
 
07:23:54.590 --> 07:23:54.600 align:start position:0%
uh permitted by the Telecommunications
 
07:23:59.110 --> 07:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
Act HB 501 even states that decisions to
 
07:24:02.150 --> 07:24:02.160 align:start position:0%
deny why 5 Wireless facilities shall be
 
07:24:03.510 --> 07:24:03.520 align:start position:0%
made in accordance with state and
 
07:24:04.910 --> 07:24:04.920 align:start position:0%
federal law and
 
07:24:08.190 --> 07:24:08.200 align:start position:0%
regulations now HP 501 is also at odds
 
07:24:10.430 --> 07:24:10.440 align:start position:0%
with the state policy to facilitate the
 
07:24:13.030 --> 07:24:13.040 align:start position:0%
provision of broadband and wire Advanced

the critical importance to the economy
 
07:24:29.708 --> 07:24:29.718 align:start position:0%
and everyday life nowadays the constant
 
07:24:32.070 --> 07:24:32.080 align:start position:0%
in the opposition to the bills the last
 
07:24:35.030 --> 07:24:35.040 align:start position:0%
now four years has been uh the
 
07:24:38.270 --> 07:24:38.280 align:start position:0%
allegations that 5G causes health
 
07:24:40.670 --> 07:24:40.680 align:start position:0%
effects uh as has been pointed out
 
07:24:43.388 --> 07:24:43.398 align:start position:0%
electromagnetic radio frequency W waves
 
07:24:45.510 --> 07:24:45.520 align:start position:0%
are nonionizing meaning they don't have
 
07:24:48.388 --> 07:24:48.398 align:start position:0%
the energy to damage uh DNA or cause
 
07:24:51.070 --> 07:24:51.080 align:start position:0%
direct tissue damage I have included in
 
07:24:53.230 --> 07:24:53.240 align:start position:0%
my written testimony a long list of
 
07:24:57.030 --> 07:24:57.040 align:start position:0%
State uh and health agencies uh that do
 
07:25:00.430 --> 07:25:00.440 align:start position:0%
not support allegations of causation uh
 
07:25:03.910 --> 07:25:03.920 align:start position:0%
health effects by um 5G and other
 
07:25:06.110 --> 07:25:06.120 align:start position:0%
telecommunications Wireless
 
07:25:08.670 --> 07:25:08.680 align:start position:0%
telecommunications um in conclusion we
 
07:25:11.910 --> 07:25:11.920 align:start position:0%
ask the committee to find H HB 501
 
07:25:14.030 --> 07:25:14.040 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate and I'm happy
 
07:25:15.868 --> 07:25:15.878 align:start position:0%
to take any questions and try to answer
 
07:25:19.070 --> 07:25:19.080 align:start position:0%
them for you thank you Mr Fabrizio are
 
07:25:22.230 --> 07:25:22.240 align:start position:0%
questions for the
 
07:25:26.030 --> 07:25:26.040 align:start position:0%
speaker seeing none thank you thank
 
07:25:35.308 --> 07:25:35.318 align:start position:0%
 
07:25:36.990 --> 07:25:37.000 align:start position:0%
good afternoon and welcome to Municipal
 
07:25:38.868 --> 07:25:38.878 align:start position:0%
and County government good afternoon
 
07:25:39.990 --> 07:25:40.000 align:start position:0%
ma'am thank you for having me and
 
07:25:45.430 --> 07:25:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:25:48.548 --> 07:25:48.558 align:start position:0%
testimony my name is Josie kundala and I
 
07:25:50.868 --> 07:25:50.878 align:start position:0%
live in Dover New Hampshire my interest
 
07:25:52.670 --> 07:25:52.680 align:start position:0%
in this bill is derived from my
 
07:25:54.628 --> 07:25:54.638 align:start position:0%
experience with the city of Manchester
 
07:25:57.110 --> 07:25:57.120 align:start position:0%
where I lived for the past two years
 
07:25:59.150 --> 07:25:59.160 align:start position:0%
last year I contacted Manchester's
 
07:26:01.510 --> 07:26:01.520 align:start position:0%
zoning health and planning departments
 
07:26:03.388 --> 07:26:03.398 align:start position:0%
about a small Wireless Communications
 
07:26:05.468 --> 07:26:05.478 align:start position:0%
facility installed near my home in a
 
07:26:07.868 --> 07:26:07.878 align:start position:0%
public right of way the city denied
 
07:26:09.788 --> 07:26:09.798 align:start position:0%
having any knowledge of the tower
 
07:26:12.670 --> 07:26:12.680 align:start position:0%
because they do not regulate or even
 
07:26:14.510 --> 07:26:14.520 align:start position:0%
keep track of the locations of any
 
07:26:16.750 --> 07:26:16.760 align:start position:0%
antenna employed in the public right of
 
07:26:20.468 --> 07:26:20.478 align:start position:0%
way um I believe uh representative Kelly
 
07:26:22.948 --> 07:26:22.958 align:start position:0%
provided a photo of a small one this is
 
07:26:24.868 --> 07:26:24.878 align:start position:0%
the one near my home on Woodberry Street
 
07:26:27.190 --> 07:26:27.200 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire uh Manchester New
 
07:26:31.230 --> 07:26:31.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um and they the reason that um
 
07:26:34.030 --> 07:26:34.040 align:start position:0%
the city uh told me that they couldn't
 
07:26:37.350 --> 07:26:37.360 align:start position:0%
uh track or even document or uh do
 
07:26:40.070 --> 07:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
anything about these facilities is RSA
 
07:26:42.868 --> 07:26:42.878 align:start position:0%
12K um the law is it's currently Rootin
 
07:26:44.628 --> 07:26:44.638 align:start position:0%
states that carriers wishing to build
 
07:26:46.430 --> 07:26:46.440 align:start position:0%
personal wireless service facilities in
 
07:26:48.430 --> 07:26:48.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire should consider
 
07:26:51.750 --> 07:26:51.760 align:start position:0%
commercially available alternative pwss
 
07:26:53.788 --> 07:26:53.798 align:start position:0%
that's personal W wireless service
 
07:26:56.628 --> 07:26:56.638 align:start position:0%
facility over tall cell towers and
 
07:27:00.430 --> 07:27:00.440 align:start position:0%
further down in uh 12 K10 section 4 It
 
07:27:02.708 --> 07:27:02.718 align:start position:0%
also says that notwithstanding anything
 
07:27:04.910 --> 07:27:04.920 align:start position:0%
to the contrary in this chapter an
 
07:27:07.750 --> 07:27:07.760 align:start position:0%
authority may not mandate require or
 
07:27:10.070 --> 07:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
regulate the installation location or
 
07:27:15.230 --> 07:27:15.240 align:start position:0%
use of pwss on utility polls um so that
 
07:27:17.788 --> 07:27:17.798 align:start position:0%
is why I'm here this is the aggravation
 
07:27:19.868 --> 07:27:19.878 align:start position:0%
that I've personally dealt with um in
 
07:27:23.628 --> 07:27:23.638 align:start position:0%
dealing with my City's um uh zoning
 
07:27:25.910 --> 07:27:25.920 align:start position:0%
officials um so I'm here to tell you
 
07:27:28.510 --> 07:27:28.520 align:start position:0%
that whether a wireless facil facility
 
07:27:31.788 --> 07:27:31.798 align:start position:0%
is on a utility poll or it's 60 feet in
 
07:27:34.230 --> 07:27:34.240 align:start position:0%
the air um it's still emitting microwave
 
07:27:36.070 --> 07:27:36.080 align:start position:0%
radiation and they should be regulated
 
07:27:39.430 --> 07:27:39.440 align:start position:0%
in the same way um 12K is trying to
 
07:27:42.070 --> 07:27:42.080 align:start position:0%
address the aesthetic objections um The
 
07:27:44.830 --> 07:27:44.840 align:start position:0%
View uh impairments that tall cell
 
07:27:47.110 --> 07:27:47.120 align:start position:0%
towers um represent and I understand
 
07:27:49.750 --> 07:27:49.760 align:start position:0%
that many uh residents in small towns
 
07:27:51.548 --> 07:27:51.558 align:start position:0%
don't like seeing cell towers in their
 
07:27:54.190 --> 07:27:54.200 align:start position:0%
Vistas but my personal objection has to
 
07:27:57.788 --> 07:27:57.798 align:start position:0%
do with the fact um which is uh detailed
 
07:28:01.110 --> 07:28:01.120 align:start position:0%
in the 5G report that um non-ionizing
 
07:28:03.830 --> 07:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
radiation is an uninsurable pollutant
 
07:28:05.910 --> 07:28:05.920 align:start position:0%
and the entire insurance industry is
 
07:28:09.510 --> 07:28:09.520 align:start position:0%
hedging against 5G um this was all
 
07:28:12.590 --> 07:28:12.600 align:start position:0%
detailed in the 5G report in 2020 and
 
07:28:16.150 --> 07:28:16.160 align:start position:0%
since that time um the U FCC has been
 
07:28:18.110 --> 07:28:18.120 align:start position:0%
sued under Environmental Health Trust
 
07:28:21.708 --> 07:28:21.718 align:start position:0%
versus FCC in 2021 and the federal judge
 
07:28:23.670 --> 07:28:23.680 align:start position:0%
declared that the sec's standards were
 
07:28:25.868 --> 07:28:25.878 align:start position:0%
capricious and arbitrary in terms of
 
07:28:28.708 --> 07:28:28.718 align:start position:0%
their exposure guidelines for microwave
 
07:28:31.910 --> 07:28:31.920 align:start position:0%
radiation so for these reasons um and
 
07:28:33.350 --> 07:28:33.360 align:start position:0%
because the New Hampshire State
 
07:28:35.910 --> 07:28:35.920 align:start position:0%
Legislature has already established a 5G
 
07:28:38.070 --> 07:28:38.080 align:start position:0%
commission and their investigation
 
07:28:39.750 --> 07:28:39.760 align:start position:0%
concluded that there is sufficient
 
07:28:41.910 --> 07:28:41.920 align:start position:0%
evidence of biological and environmental
 
07:28:44.868 --> 07:28:44.878 align:start position:0%
effects from these antenna um that this
 
07:28:47.430 --> 07:28:47.440 align:start position:0%
um legislature should remove or amend
 
07:28:49.190 --> 07:28:49.200 align:start position:0%
their laws and they have not done that
 
07:28:50.830 --> 07:28:50.840 align:start position:0%
since the establishment of the 5G
 
07:28:53.150 --> 07:28:53.160 align:start position:0%
Commission Now if the state does not
 
07:28:55.190 --> 07:28:55.200 align:start position:0%
wish to be active um on the topic
 
07:28:57.590 --> 07:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
microwave radiation regulation then they
 
07:28:59.388 --> 07:28:59.398 align:start position:0%
should leave the matter to local
 
07:29:01.708 --> 07:29:01.718 align:start position:0%
constituents and um health and planning
 
07:29:04.510 --> 07:29:04.520 align:start position:0%
boards that's my position um this bill
 
07:29:06.948 --> 07:29:06.958 align:start position:0%
does not in any way overrule federal
 
07:29:10.270 --> 07:29:10.280 align:start position:0%
policy or take away anyone's uh right to
 
07:29:12.910 --> 07:29:12.920 align:start position:0%
access services or for providers to meet
 
07:29:14.948 --> 07:29:14.958 align:start position:0%
the demand for services there are
 
07:29:17.350 --> 07:29:17.360 align:start position:0%
already ample cell towers um throughout
 
07:29:20.910 --> 07:29:20.920 align:start position:0%
the state um Na nasua and Manchester are
 
07:29:22.510 --> 07:29:22.520 align:start position:0%
headlong in the deployment of these
 
07:29:25.948 --> 07:29:25.958 align:start position:0%
small Wireless facilities um but unlike
 
07:29:28.628 --> 07:29:28.638 align:start position:0%
um residents of smaller towns who might
 
07:29:30.350 --> 07:29:30.360 align:start position:0%
have an objection to a cell tower to in
 
07:29:32.990 --> 07:29:33.000 align:start position:0%
their view if you are a resident of a
 
07:29:34.788 --> 07:29:34.798 align:start position:0%
place like Manchester or nashaa or
 
07:29:37.070 --> 07:29:37.080 align:start position:0%
Hampton where the small Wireless uh
 
07:29:39.990 --> 07:29:40.000 align:start position:0%
towers are being deployed you have no
 
07:29:42.750 --> 07:29:42.760 align:start position:0%
you no means uh either by planning board
 
07:29:45.030 --> 07:29:45.040 align:start position:0%
Selectmen zoning Health Department none
 
07:29:48.990 --> 07:29:49.000 align:start position:0%
of those uh regulatory bodies can
 
07:29:51.590 --> 07:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
address your issues even though the
 
07:29:53.830 --> 07:29:53.840 align:start position:0%
state has admitted that the harms and
 
07:29:56.868 --> 07:29:56.878 align:start position:0%
Hazards exist in the 5G report so for
 
07:29:58.948 --> 07:29:58.958 align:start position:0%
that reason I'm asking the committee to
 
07:30:01.388 --> 07:30:01.398 align:start position:0%
review the 5G report and to begin to
 
07:30:03.750 --> 07:30:03.760 align:start position:0%
implement some of its recommendations of
 
07:30:07.270 --> 07:30:07.280 align:start position:0%
which uh HB 501 is a good start thank
 
07:30:09.750 --> 07:30:09.760 align:start position:0%
you thank you are you willing to take

good afternoon and welcome back to
 
07:31:07.388 --> 07:31:07.398 align:start position:0%
Municipal and County
 
07:31:09.670 --> 07:31:09.680 align:start position:0%
government thank you Madame chair and
 
07:31:11.350 --> 07:31:11.360 align:start position:0%
members of the municipal and County
 
07:31:13.788 --> 07:31:13.798 align:start position:0%
government committee for the record my
 
07:31:16.150 --> 07:31:16.160 align:start position:0%
name is Eric power I'm from Brooklyn
 
07:31:17.868 --> 07:31:17.878 align:start position:0%
representing myself and in favor of
 
07:31:19.308 --> 07:31:19.318 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
07:31:22.388 --> 07:31:22.398 align:start position:0%
501 um as I mentioned previously I serve
 
07:31:24.868 --> 07:31:24.878 align:start position:0%
on the planning board in Brookline been
 
07:31:26.548 --> 07:31:26.558 align:start position:0%
serving on it since
 
07:31:30.350 --> 07:31:30.360 align:start position:0%
2021 going into my fifth year uh
 
07:31:34.150 --> 07:31:34.160 align:start position:0%
I also am a electrical engineer I have a
 
07:31:37.590 --> 07:31:37.600 align:start position:0%
um a background in RF and background in
 
07:31:39.990 --> 07:31:40.000 align:start position:0%
electronic warfare for over three
 
07:31:43.110 --> 07:31:43.120 align:start position:0%
decades um I have a bachelor's degree
 
07:31:45.190 --> 07:31:45.200 align:start position:0%
from Wester poly Technic Institute in
 
07:31:47.670 --> 07:31:47.680 align:start position:0%
electrical engineering and also a
 
07:31:48.868 --> 07:31:48.878 align:start position:0%
master's degree in electrical
 
07:31:51.590 --> 07:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
engineering from nor Eastern University
 
07:31:54.510 --> 07:31:54.520 align:start position:0%
uh I am a senior member of the uh
 
07:31:56.548 --> 07:31:56.558 align:start position:0%
Institute for electronics and electrical
 
07:31:59.990 --> 07:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
engineers the i e so I've had a lot of
 
07:32:02.990 --> 07:32:03.000 align:start position:0%
experience with RF and it's definitely
 
07:32:04.948 --> 07:32:04.958 align:start position:0%
something that you have to consider that
 
07:32:06.910 --> 07:32:06.920 align:start position:0%
it's we don't know all the answers right
 
07:32:12.190 --> 07:32:12.200 align:start position:0%
now um 5G by its nature if you go back
 
07:32:15.388 --> 07:32:15.398 align:start position:0%
to physics the the very path loss
 
07:32:18.468 --> 07:32:18.478 align:start position:0%
formula for physics shows that the uh
 
07:32:19.830 --> 07:32:19.840 align:start position:0%
the path loss that means how much the
 
07:32:22.468 --> 07:32:22.478 align:start position:0%
signal attenuates is if is it inversely
 
07:32:23.990 --> 07:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
proportional to the square of the
 
07:32:25.948 --> 07:32:25.958 align:start position:0%
frequency so the higher you go in
 
07:32:28.230 --> 07:32:28.240 align:start position:0%
frequency at the square of that you're
 
07:32:31.548 --> 07:32:31.558 align:start position:0%
going down in power so if you need to
 
07:32:33.548 --> 07:32:33.558 align:start position:0%
keep Communications and you're going up
 
07:32:35.230 --> 07:32:35.240 align:start position:0%
higher in frequency what do you think
 
07:32:37.590 --> 07:32:37.600 align:start position:0%
you have to do with the power you have
 
07:32:39.670 --> 07:32:39.680 align:start position:0%
to go up a lot to actually establish
 
07:32:41.830 --> 07:32:41.840 align:start position:0%
that now some modulation and some coding
 
07:32:46.510 --> 07:32:46.520 align:start position:0%
can definitely um take care of that and
 
07:32:49.388 --> 07:32:49.398 align:start position:0%
um but you know the proliferation of
 
07:32:51.670 --> 07:32:51.680 align:start position:0%
these without and putting my planning
 
07:32:54.670 --> 07:32:54.680 align:start position:0%
board hat back on being able not to be
 
07:32:57.190 --> 07:32:57.200 align:start position:0%
able to say or have anything to do with
 
07:32:59.948 --> 07:32:59.958 align:start position:0%
these personal Wireless uh facilities is
 
07:33:02.830 --> 07:33:02.840 align:start position:0%
being put in on right of ways I think is
 
07:33:05.708 --> 07:33:05.718 align:start position:0%
wrong the 5G commission talked about
 
07:33:09.868 --> 07:33:09.878 align:start position:0%
that RSA 12K let you do that now and I
 
07:33:13.350 --> 07:33:13.360 align:start position:0%
think that that this uh bill is is a is
 
07:33:15.990 --> 07:33:16.000 align:start position:0%
a good bill to help bring that local
 
07:33:19.070 --> 07:33:19.080 align:start position:0%
control back we have a lot of money and
 
07:33:21.788 --> 07:33:21.798 align:start position:0%
a lot of business interest here I'm not
 
07:33:24.110 --> 07:33:24.120 align:start position:0%
here for that I'm here for the the
 
07:33:26.030 --> 07:33:26.040 align:start position:0%
residents of my town and the residents
 
07:33:28.670 --> 07:33:28.680 align:start position:0%
of the state to do the right thing and
 
07:33:31.230 --> 07:33:31.240 align:start position:0%
make sure that we have control and that
 
07:33:33.830 --> 07:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
we understand what's going on right now
 
07:33:38.830 --> 07:33:38.840 align:start position:0%
we do not have the millimeter wave um 5G
 
07:33:40.750 --> 07:33:40.760 align:start position:0%
deployed here much in New Hampshire but
 
07:33:42.670 --> 07:33:42.680 align:start position:0%
that's going to that is going to be
 
07:33:45.628 --> 07:33:45.638 align:start position:0%
coming if if you don't take action um
 
07:33:47.110 --> 07:33:47.120 align:start position:0%
and we do not know what's going to
 
07:33:50.510 --> 07:33:50.520 align:start position:0%
happen for those that aren't aware um
 
07:33:53.230 --> 07:33:53.240 align:start position:0%
microwave ovens run at 2.4 gigahertz
 
07:33:55.190 --> 07:33:55.200 align:start position:0%
that's where you cook your food so you
 
07:33:57.430 --> 07:33:57.440 align:start position:0%
know keep that in mind it has higher
 
07:33:59.868 --> 07:33:59.878 align:start position:0%
power levels but it's we use microwave
 
07:34:01.308 --> 07:34:01.318 align:start position:0%
to cook food and you can you know what
 
07:34:03.830 --> 07:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
does to food it Heats it up and and it
 
07:34:06.590 --> 07:34:06.600 align:start position:0%
Cooks it right so um the other thing I'd
 
07:34:09.230 --> 07:34:09.240 align:start position:0%
like to mention is the there's going to
 
07:34:11.270 --> 07:34:11.280 align:start position:0%
be a tendency to go to these higher
 
07:34:14.510 --> 07:34:14.520 align:start position:0%
carriers because at higher carriers you
 
07:34:16.308 --> 07:34:16.318 align:start position:0%
have higher bandwidth and at higher
 
07:34:19.708 --> 07:34:19.718 align:start position:0%
bandwidth you have more capacity so the
 
07:34:21.548 --> 07:34:21.558 align:start position:0%
the market is going to drive the
 
07:34:24.910 --> 07:34:24.920 align:start position:0%
adoption of these higher gigahertz level
 
07:34:27.548 --> 07:34:27.558 align:start position:0%
you know 30 gigahertz and above
 
07:34:29.430 --> 07:34:29.440 align:start position:0%
standards and they're not here yet but
 
07:34:31.830 --> 07:34:31.840 align:start position:0%
we have a chance to do things the right
 
07:34:35.150 --> 07:34:35.160 align:start position:0%
way with having local control and if if
 
07:34:37.868 --> 07:34:37.878 align:start position:0%
this bill was to pass in my role on the
 
07:34:40.708 --> 07:34:40.718 align:start position:0%
planning board I would be able to use my
 
07:34:43.628 --> 07:34:43.638 align:start position:0%
technical knowledge as along with the
 
07:34:45.948 --> 07:34:45.958 align:start position:0%
local control that we have to make
 
07:34:48.948 --> 07:34:48.958 align:start position:0%
Intelligent Decisions on these Wireless
 
07:34:50.830 --> 07:34:50.840 align:start position:0%
facilities before it's too late and they
 
07:34:52.910 --> 07:34:52.920 align:start position:0%
proliferate everywhere you've heard from
 
07:34:55.030 --> 07:34:55.040 align:start position:0%
prior speakers that it's already
 
07:34:57.868 --> 07:34:57.878 align:start position:0%
starting to roll out in Manchester and
 
07:34:59.750 --> 07:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
in Nashville and maybe in some other
 
07:35:04.670 --> 07:35:04.680 align:start position:0%
urban areas this is the time to um to
 
07:35:06.788 --> 07:35:06.798 align:start position:0%
pull back the Reign on this a little bit
 
07:35:10.548 --> 07:35:10.558 align:start position:0%
and to um you know pass House Bill 501
 
07:35:13.708 --> 07:35:13.718 align:start position:0%
in order to make reasonable control and
 
07:35:15.990 --> 07:35:16.000 align:start position:0%
if you look at paragraphs four and five
 
07:35:17.910 --> 07:35:17.920 align:start position:0%
of the bill it says we cannot do
 
07:35:20.868 --> 07:35:20.878 align:start position:0%
anything that violates state or federal
 
07:35:22.670 --> 07:35:22.680 align:start position:0%
regulation so we're not going to be able
 
07:35:24.670 --> 07:35:24.680 align:start position:0%
to do anything we can't do by federal
 
07:35:27.270 --> 07:35:27.280 align:start position:0%
law so we're going to be bound by that
 
07:35:29.270 --> 07:35:29.280 align:start position:0%
so I think it has the safeguards that we
 
07:35:31.590 --> 07:35:31.600 align:start position:0%
need and I hope that you find it a to
 
07:35:33.468 --> 07:35:33.478 align:start position:0%
pass thank you very much I'll take
 
07:35:35.590 --> 07:35:35.600 align:start position:0%
questions are there any questions for
 
07:35:35.600 --> 07:35:37.708 align:start position:0%
questions are there any questions for
the

07:35:37.708 --> 07:35:37.718 align:start position:0%
the
 
07:35:42.628 --> 07:35:42.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:35:46.468 --> 07:35:46.478 align:start position:0%
you oh the last pink card that I have is
 
07:35:46.478 --> 07:35:47.948 align:start position:0%
you oh the last pink card that I have is
The

07:35:47.948 --> 07:35:47.958 align:start position:0%
The
 
07:35:53.830 --> 07:35:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:35:57.070 --> 07:35:57.080 align:start position:0%
Gart good afternoon and welcome to
 
07:35:58.830 --> 07:35:58.840 align:start position:0%
Municipal and County government good
 
07:36:00.948 --> 07:36:00.958 align:start position:0%
afternoon thank you Committee just I
 
07:36:04.468 --> 07:36:04.478 align:start position:0%
don't want to be um disrespectful but
 
07:36:06.990 --> 07:36:07.000 align:start position:0%
the The Honorable title thing I just I
 
07:36:08.230 --> 07:36:08.240 align:start position:0%
just shy away from me it gets kind of
 
07:36:10.150 --> 07:36:10.160 align:start position:0%
weird to me so but I do thank I do thank
 
07:36:13.270 --> 07:36:13.280 align:start position:0%
you for that and I'm here today to speak
 
07:36:14.788 --> 07:36:14.798 align:start position:0%
about a bill that I think is very
 
07:36:17.670 --> 07:36:17.680 align:start position:0%
important I brought a bill last year to
 
07:36:19.830 --> 07:36:19.840 align:start position:0%
implement the recommendations from the
 
07:36:21.948 --> 07:36:21.958 align:start position:0%
5G commission that was instituted in
 
07:36:24.110 --> 07:36:24.120 align:start position:0%
2020 that we already mentioned but a lot
 
07:36:26.350 --> 07:36:26.360 align:start position:0%
of time and energy has gone into this
 
07:36:27.830 --> 07:36:27.840 align:start position:0%
issue New Hampshire was the first state
 
07:36:30.230 --> 07:36:30.240 align:start position:0%
and if you look up 5G effects and
 
07:36:32.350 --> 07:36:32.360 align:start position:0%
dangers and so forth online that comes
 
07:36:33.788 --> 07:36:33.798 align:start position:0%
up everywhere and I do believe that New
 
07:36:36.230 --> 07:36:36.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire again has to take the lead and
 
07:36:38.830 --> 07:36:38.840 align:start position:0%
start really addressing an issue that we
 
07:36:40.590 --> 07:36:40.600 align:start position:0%
haven't looked at since
 
07:36:42.628 --> 07:36:42.638 align:start position:0%
1996 so let me explain now I just want
 
07:36:44.948 --> 07:36:44.958 align:start position:0%
to set the scene here 1996 Independence
 
07:36:46.948 --> 07:36:46.958 align:start position:0%
Day was a movie in the theaters twister
 
07:36:50.628 --> 07:36:50.638 align:start position:0%
really garbage movie but among also
 
07:36:53.750 --> 07:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
the um what do we
 
07:36:56.110 --> 07:36:56.120 align:start position:0%
have I'm sorry I lost my train thought
 
07:36:57.628 --> 07:36:57.638 align:start position:0%
with that twister was such a bad movie
 
07:37:00.948 --> 07:37:00.958 align:start position:0%
but the FCC has not changed their
 
07:37:03.030 --> 07:37:03.040 align:start position:0%
Wireless radiation human exposure limits
 
07:37:07.590 --> 07:37:07.600 align:start position:0%
since 1996 despite a court case the 2021
 
07:37:08.948 --> 07:37:08.958 align:start position:0%
US court of appeals for District of
 
07:37:10.788 --> 07:37:10.798 align:start position:0%
Columbia judgment in environmental
 
07:37:12.510 --> 07:37:12.520 align:start position:0%
health trusts at all versus the FCC
 
07:37:14.270 --> 07:37:14.280 align:start position:0%
found that the fcc's refusal to update
 
07:37:17.628 --> 07:37:17.638 align:start position:0%
its 1996 limits to be quote arbitrary
 
07:37:19.190 --> 07:37:19.200 align:start position:0%
and capricious end quote because it
 
07:37:20.750 --> 07:37:20.760 align:start position:0%
ignored the science on children's
 
07:37:22.948 --> 07:37:22.958 align:start position:0%
vulnerability on long-term exposure on
 
07:37:24.468 --> 07:37:24.478 align:start position:0%
non-cancer impacts such as damage to
 
07:37:26.788 --> 07:37:26.798 align:start position:0%
memory and sperm on environmental
 
07:37:29.510 --> 07:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
impacts birds bees trees Etc and the
 
07:37:30.910 --> 07:37:30.920 align:start position:0%
hundreds of testimonies submitted by
 
07:37:32.350 --> 07:37:32.360 align:start position:0%
people reporting injuries now this is
 
07:37:34.270 --> 07:37:34.280 align:start position:0%
from an article from Environmental
 
07:37:35.830 --> 07:37:35.840 align:start position:0%
Health Trust which is a great website
 
07:37:37.868 --> 07:37:37.878 align:start position:0%
has a lot of good data info Graphics you
 
07:37:39.708 --> 07:37:39.718 align:start position:0%
can kind of just for somebody like me
 
07:37:41.910 --> 07:37:41.920 align:start position:0%
with ad helps you kind of just you know
 
07:37:44.030 --> 07:37:44.040 align:start position:0%
keep busy and find out what's going on
 
07:37:46.270 --> 07:37:46.280 align:start position:0%
but this is also mentioning the Ohio
 
07:37:48.110 --> 07:37:48.120 align:start position:0%
lawmakers that wrote letters to the FCC
 
07:37:50.750 --> 07:37:50.760 align:start position:0%
saying hey we want to know what these
 
07:37:53.548 --> 07:37:53.558 align:start position:0%
new limits are 1996 was a long time ago
 
07:37:55.830 --> 07:37:55.840 align:start position:0%
I was 11 years old a lot has changed
 
07:37:57.270 --> 07:37:57.280 align:start position:0%
cell phones were not nearly as
 
07:37:58.868 --> 07:37:58.878 align:start position:0%
ubiquitous as they are today and a lot
 
07:38:00.110 --> 07:38:00.120 align:start position:0%
of other techn
 
07:38:02.868 --> 07:38:02.878 align:start position:0%
ology as long along with the governor of
 
07:38:05.308 --> 07:38:05.318 align:start position:0%
Wyoming in 2022 is I mean there's a ton
 
07:38:06.628 --> 07:38:06.638 align:start position:0%
of people that submitted letters to the
 
07:38:08.388 --> 07:38:08.398 align:start position:0%
FC and so forth but we haven't gotten
 
07:38:10.070 --> 07:38:10.080 align:start position:0%
anywhere now hopefully with the new make
 
07:38:11.830 --> 07:38:11.840 align:start position:0%
America healthy again movement I'm
 
07:38:13.308 --> 07:38:13.318 align:start position:0%
hoping that does occur but I think we
 
07:38:14.708 --> 07:38:14.718 align:start position:0%
also need to take that at the local
 
07:38:17.030 --> 07:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
level and this is what this does You're
 
07:38:19.990 --> 07:38:20.000 align:start position:0%
simply saying local entities do what you
 
07:38:21.548 --> 07:38:21.558 align:start position:0%
wish according to the wishes of your
 
07:38:24.510 --> 07:38:24.520 align:start position:0%
will of your constituents who to be
 
07:38:26.070 --> 07:38:26.080 align:start position:0%
quite honest with you I think people in
 
07:38:29.110 --> 07:38:29.120 align:start position:0%
general know the truth better than
 
07:38:31.750 --> 07:38:31.760 align:start position:0%
certain people who are not able to
 
07:38:33.708 --> 07:38:33.718 align:start position:0%
devote as much time to this to this
 
07:38:34.868 --> 07:38:34.878 align:start position:0%
subject and other things for instance
 
07:38:36.590 --> 07:38:36.600 align:start position:0%
the committee you guys are tired it's a
 
07:38:37.788 --> 07:38:37.798 align:start position:0%
long day someone's coming on five
 
07:38:39.548 --> 07:38:39.558 align:start position:0%
o'clock how many people really going to
 
07:38:40.948 --> 07:38:40.958 align:start position:0%
you know do a little extra credit work
 
07:38:42.270 --> 07:38:42.280 align:start position:0%
homework tonight and look into this and
 
07:38:43.708 --> 07:38:43.718 align:start position:0%
I don't blame you I didn't do much
 
07:38:46.388 --> 07:38:46.398 align:start position:0%
myself but I do know on Edna that I
 
07:38:49.548 --> 07:38:49.558 align:start position:0%
served last term every year apparently
 
07:38:52.628 --> 07:38:52.638 align:start position:0%
every two years the fire codes
 
07:38:54.510 --> 07:38:54.520 align:start position:0%
representative D knows the fire codes
 
07:38:56.510 --> 07:38:56.520 align:start position:0%
get updated the building codes get
 
07:38:57.990 --> 07:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
updated they were trying to push some
 
07:39:00.270 --> 07:39:00.280 align:start position:0%
new environmental you know uh reducing I
 
07:39:02.750 --> 07:39:02.760 align:start position:0%
mean increasing the insulation on houses
 
07:39:05.190 --> 07:39:05.200 align:start position:0%
drive up the cost further but that stuff
 
07:39:07.708 --> 07:39:07.718 align:start position:0%
happens every other year we have to do
 
07:39:09.308 --> 07:39:09.318 align:start position:0%
it I still don't understand why we have
 
07:39:10.868 --> 07:39:10.878 align:start position:0%
to do it because the fire commissioner
 
07:39:12.708 --> 07:39:12.718 align:start position:0%
sorry Fire Marshall for the state
 
07:39:15.110 --> 07:39:15.120 align:start position:0%
admitted that there's no real proof that
 
07:39:17.388 --> 07:39:17.398 align:start position:0%
the fire code actually there's no metric
 
07:39:18.830 --> 07:39:18.840 align:start position:0%
to show that it's saving lives or
 
07:39:20.230 --> 07:39:20.240 align:start position:0%
affecting anything it's just something
 
07:39:22.670 --> 07:39:22.680 align:start position:0%
we do because everybody's doing it so I
 
07:39:25.510 --> 07:39:25.520 align:start position:0%
would say that you know since 1996 maybe
 
07:39:27.030 --> 07:39:27.040 align:start position:0%
this is something we should be doing at
 
07:39:28.430 --> 07:39:28.440 align:start position:0%
the state level we did with the 5G
 
07:39:30.868 --> 07:39:30.878 align:start position:0%
Commission so I'm encouraging you to
 
07:39:32.628 --> 07:39:32.638 align:start position:0%
support this
 
07:39:34.750 --> 07:39:34.760 align:start position:0%
legislation and hopefully we can get to
 
07:39:36.548 --> 07:39:36.558 align:start position:0%
the bottom of what's going on and I just
 
07:39:38.830 --> 07:39:38.840 align:start position:0%
want to let you know that I did I just
 
07:39:40.430 --> 07:39:40.440 align:start position:0%
happen to glance on my mailbox usually I
 
07:39:42.708 --> 07:39:42.718 align:start position:0%
throw away all this stuff but from a
 
07:39:44.388 --> 07:39:44.398 align:start position:0%
former speaker his organization put out
 
07:39:46.830 --> 07:39:46.840 align:start position:0%
the legislative report of 2024 and I
 
07:39:47.990 --> 07:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
just looked at on the cover because
 
07:39:50.670 --> 07:39:50.680 align:start position:0%
mentioned 5G Bill killed again but in
 
07:39:52.548 --> 07:39:52.558 align:start position:0%
that article you know little fluff piece
 
07:39:54.468 --> 07:39:54.478 align:start position:0%
anyway various polls consistently show
 
07:39:55.948 --> 07:39:55.958 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire residents support Mobile
 
07:39:57.270 --> 07:39:57.280 align:start position:0%
Wireless upgrades in their Community
 
07:39:58.948 --> 07:39:58.958 align:start position:0%
including small cell antennas which are
 
07:40:00.830 --> 07:40:00.840 align:start position:0%
essential for 5G deployment right
 
07:40:02.350 --> 07:40:02.360 align:start position:0%
outside the bedroom windows I didn't say
 
07:40:04.670 --> 07:40:04.680 align:start position:0%
that but the point is why do we have 100
 
07:40:06.990 --> 07:40:07.000 align:start position:0%
people Plus in support of this bill and
 
07:40:08.868 --> 07:40:08.878 align:start position:0%
I believe it was like 15 to 20 maybe you
 
07:40:10.628 --> 07:40:10.638 align:start position:0%
guys will mention that at the end I
 
07:40:12.030 --> 07:40:12.040 align:start position:0%
don't think people are in support of
 
07:40:15.270 --> 07:40:15.280 align:start position:0%
this as much as the industry paid
 
07:40:17.468 --> 07:40:17.478 align:start position:0%
lobbyists are trying to tell us and I
 
07:40:18.708 --> 07:40:18.718 align:start position:0%
think we have serious problems and we
 
07:40:20.708 --> 07:40:20.718 align:start position:0%
need to look at it and trust people that
 
07:40:22.070 --> 07:40:22.080 align:start position:0%
the 5G commission just look at the
 
07:40:24.308 --> 07:40:24.318 align:start position:0%
report I mean 600 pages but just look at
 
07:40:26.270 --> 07:40:26.280 align:start position:0%
the recommendations is a lot of effort
 
07:40:28.230 --> 07:40:28.240 align:start position:0%
went in and I really think we should we
 
07:40:31.030 --> 07:40:31.040 align:start position:0%
should move on this so thank
 
07:40:34.468 --> 07:40:34.478 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr G geard are there
 
07:40:36.830 --> 07:40:36.840 align:start position:0%
questions representative Elward is
 
07:40:38.190 --> 07:40:38.200 align:start position:0%
recognized for a
 
07:40:41.388 --> 07:40:41.398 align:start position:0%
question thank you Madame chairman good
 
07:40:44.110 --> 07:40:44.120 align:start position:0%
to see you good to see you thank you do
 
07:40:44.120 --> 07:40:45.350 align:start position:0%
to see you good to see you thank you do
you

07:40:45.350 --> 07:40:45.360 align:start position:0%
you
 
07:40:49.230 --> 07:40:49.240 align:start position:0%
think average members of planning
 
07:40:54.270 --> 07:40:54.280 align:start position:0%
boards have the technical background
 
07:40:56.628 --> 07:40:56.638 align:start position:0%
education uh
 
07:40:59.510 --> 07:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
experience to
 
07:41:02.868 --> 07:41:02.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:41:05.590 --> 07:41:05.600 align:start position:0%
industry I would argue that planning
 
07:41:08.388 --> 07:41:08.398 align:start position:0%
boards and and everything in that realm
 
07:41:10.230 --> 07:41:10.240 align:start position:0%
of central planning reminds me of some
 
07:41:12.628 --> 07:41:12.638 align:start position:0%
kind of weird stalinesque dystopian
 
07:41:14.030 --> 07:41:14.040 align:start position:0%
Nightmare and I'm not really a big fan
 
07:41:16.708 --> 07:41:16.718 align:start position:0%
of that what I'm disappointed in just F
 
07:41:18.110 --> 07:41:18.120 align:start position:0%
off that what I'm disappointed in is
 
07:41:19.590 --> 07:41:19.600 align:start position:0%
that the average person does not really
 
07:41:22.110 --> 07:41:22.120 align:start position:0%
have any way to to stop let's say a
 
07:41:23.868 --> 07:41:23.878 align:start position:0%
small cell antenna outside their bedroom
 
07:41:28.230 --> 07:41:28.240 align:start position:0%
window in a city so that's all I got to
 
07:41:33.150 --> 07:41:33.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:41:37.070 --> 07:41:37.080 align:start position:0%
questions see seeing none thank you so
 
07:41:41.190 --> 07:41:41.200 align:start position:0%
