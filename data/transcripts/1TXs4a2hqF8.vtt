um
 
00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 align:start position:0%
the schedule for getting bills out of
 
00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 align:start position:0%
committee has been moved
 
00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 align:start position:0%
and the first session day will be on
 
00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 align:start position:0%
the date that all bills had to be
 
00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 align:start position:0%
reported out early bills was the 17th
 
00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 align:start position:0%
because now with that session days on
 
00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 align:start position:0%
the 15th the date for us to get early
 
00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:42.319 align:start position:0%
bills out is the
 
00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 align:start position:0%
um 10th
 
00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 align:start position:0%
at noon
 
00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 align:start position:0%
so yeah that's oh great is right we
 
00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 align:start position:0%
we've heard most of our early bills we
 
00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 align:start position:0%
have 15 early bills
 
00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519 align:start position:0%
and i believe the schedule we have set
 
00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 align:start position:0%
up we can get that we have just about a
 
00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:00.800 align:start position:0%
full day and a half to take care of
 
00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 align:start position:0%
executing 15 bills that should not be an
 
00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:06.070 align:start position:0%
executing 15 bills that should not be an
issue

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.110 align:start position:0%
 
if

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 align:start position:0%
those that are looking to do amendments
 
00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 align:start position:0%
can get those amendments done prior to
 
00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 align:start position:0%
that particular day
 
00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 align:start position:0%
i understand there's times when we're in
 
00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 align:start position:0%
session or in an executive session
 
00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 align:start position:0%
and we all concur we need an amendment
 
00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 align:start position:0%
to this because it's basically it's got
 
00:03:25.589 --> 00:03:25.599 align:start position:0%
some good stuff in it
 
00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 align:start position:0%
that we can take care of but if you have
 
00:03:29.589 --> 00:03:29.599 align:start position:0%
something that you're working on try and
 
00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 align:start position:0%
get it going right now i had a chat with
 
00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 align:start position:0%
anthony this morning and he encouraged
 
00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 align:start position:0%
us to try and get things done as quickly
 
00:03:36.869 --> 00:03:36.879 align:start position:0%
as possible in terms of amending
 
00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:37.990 align:start position:0%
as possible in terms of amending
language

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 align:start position:0%
language
 
00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:48.149 --> 00:03:48.159 align:start position:0%
yes we do um
 
00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
of course you note that executive
 
00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 align:start position:0%
sessions may follow any on any bill any
 
00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:56.869 align:start position:0%
sessions may follow any on any bill any
day

00:03:56.869 --> 00:03:56.879 align:start position:0%
day
 
00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 align:start position:0%
uh but on the if you look at january the
 
00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:01.990 align:start position:0%
uh but on the if you look at january the
25th

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 align:start position:0%
that is a tuesday
 
00:04:05.429 --> 00:04:05.439 align:start position:0%
we have one bill at the top of the
 
00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 align:start position:0%
schedule there
 
00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 align:start position:0%
1660 which is an early bill
 
00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 align:start position:0%

00:04:12.789 --> 00:04:12.799 align:start position:0%

be doing that
 
00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:22.479 align:start position:0%

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
um on the 25th of january then there is
 
00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 align:start position:0%
another one a date that i have i don't
 
00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.130 align:start position:0%
believe it's in this calendar
 
00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:33.749 align:start position:0%
believe it's in this calendar
[Music]

00:04:33.749 --> 00:04:33.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:37.040 align:start position:0%
let's see if i've got that too
 
00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 align:start position:0%
which i do yes okay
 
00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:43.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:45.430 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:45.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:04:47.749 --> 00:04:47.759 align:start position:0%
yes on the ninth
 
00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:50.320 align:start position:0%
we have that day set aside for exacting
 
00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.280 align:start position:0%
all day all day on the 9th of february
 
00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360 align:start position:0%
and i had the 10th originally set for
 
00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680 align:start position:0%
exacting all day but now we've been told
 
00:04:59.749 --> 00:04:59.759 align:start position:0%
we have half a day
 
00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:02.320 align:start position:0%
so at this point in time
 
00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:03.510 align:start position:0%
so at this point in time
um

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
we we have those days set aside although
 
00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.120 align:start position:0%
we have some other days where we're
 
00:05:09.749 --> 00:05:09.759 align:start position:0%
hearing only uh like five bills on
 
00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
february the 8th
 
00:05:13.749 --> 00:05:13.759 align:start position:0%
so that gives us opportunity to have
 
00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 align:start position:0%
exec sessions there as we get closer to
 
00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:18.479 align:start position:0%
those dates i will let you know
 
00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:26.870 align:start position:0%
those dates i will let you know
yes

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:27.670 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:27.680 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 align:start position:0%
i think if you talk to dave he can tell
 
00:05:31.749 --> 00:05:31.759 align:start position:0%
you where to find that
 
00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:33.120 align:start position:0%
there's a search there where you can
 
00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:34.479 align:start position:0%
pick all that up
 
00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:40.310 align:start position:0%
pick all that up
yep

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:42.469 --> 00:05:42.479 align:start position:0%
okay with that i'd like to go ahead with
 
00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:44.639 align:start position:0%

and i'm here to introduce the uh the
 
00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:12.560 align:start position:0%
bill referenced 1632 fn although the fn
 
00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:16.400 align:start position:0%
is a minuscule amount of 27 000
 
00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:18.880 align:start position:0%
28 000 something like that
 
00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:21.520 align:start position:0%
at any rate i can
 
00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:23.680 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to to join with you today and
 
00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
what i hope is the beginning of a new
 
00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:30.160 align:start position:0%
approach to teaching race relations in
 
00:06:33.189 --> 00:06:33.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:34.400 align:start position:0%
my background
 
00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:36.080 align:start position:0%
as some of you may know comes from
 
00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:38.000 align:start position:0%
northern indiana
 
00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:41.360 align:start position:0%
large amish population in the uh town
 
00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
where i was raised and my grandparents
 
00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:46.800 align:start position:0%
lived just up the street as it were as
 
00:06:48.629 --> 00:06:48.639 align:start position:0%
say up here
 
00:06:50.629 --> 00:06:50.639 align:start position:0%
in elkhart
 
00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:52.880 align:start position:0%
my other grandparents my maternal
 
00:06:56.629 --> 00:06:56.639 align:start position:0%
grandparents lived in harlan kentucky
 
00:06:58.629 --> 00:06:58.639 align:start position:0%
if you look up harlan kentucky you'll
 
00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:01.440 align:start position:0%
see the uh appalachian
 
00:07:03.589 --> 00:07:03.599 align:start position:0%
bloody harlan
 
00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:05.680 align:start position:0%
and there's a reason for that both the
 
00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:07.840 align:start position:0%
cold wars and the unions
 
00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:10.400 align:start position:0%
and uh there were some other incidents
 
00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:11.680 align:start position:0%
that took place
 
00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:14.080 align:start position:0%
that's where i first became as a young
 
00:07:16.629 --> 00:07:16.639 align:start position:0%
child in the 60s
 
00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:18.400 align:start position:0%
50s and 60s
 
00:07:21.189 --> 00:07:21.199 align:start position:0%
i hate to say 50s
 
00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:22.880 align:start position:0%
being related to
 
00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:24.800 align:start position:0%
race relations it was kind of
 
00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:27.440 align:start position:0%
interesting to ask my father why there
 
00:07:29.589 --> 00:07:29.599 align:start position:0%
were two drinking fountains at the
 
00:07:32.629 --> 00:07:32.639 align:start position:0%
county courthouse i had no idea why
 
00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:33.840 align:start position:0%
and didn't
 
00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:36.160 align:start position:0%
understand it
 
00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
that experience
 
00:07:39.589 --> 00:07:39.599 align:start position:0%
carried me forward
 
00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
this last summer i ran into a gentleman
 
00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:45.840 align:start position:0%
by the name of dr matthew daniels who
 
00:07:48.469 --> 00:07:48.479 align:start position:0%
talked about this particular program
 
00:07:50.469 --> 00:07:50.479 align:start position:0%
this program has already been adopted in
 
00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:52.160 align:start position:0%
several states and it's being considered
 
00:07:53.589 --> 00:07:53.599 align:start position:0%
in another
 
00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:59.110 --> 00:07:59.120 align:start position:0%
for this term
 
00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:02.080 align:start position:0%
uh texas georgia the dakotas
 
00:08:04.469 --> 00:08:04.479 align:start position:0%
uh colorado
 
00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:06.560 align:start position:0%
right off the top of my head
 
00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:08.160 align:start position:0%
it's interesting that the dakotas are
 
00:08:09.589 --> 00:08:09.599 align:start position:0%
thinking of it because two of my
 
00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:11.360 align:start position:0%
classmates who are twins
 
00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:13.280 align:start position:0%
you one was in north dakota and one was
 
00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
in south dakota have the same office
 
00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:19.120 align:start position:0%
that we hold as state representatives
 
00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
although they get paid more
 
00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:23.120 align:start position:0%
or got paid more than they've retired
 
00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:25.510 align:start position:0%
or got paid more than they've retired
now

00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
one of the things that
 
00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
stuck with me from my childhood was the
 
00:08:31.909 --> 00:08:31.919 align:start position:0%
fact that
 
00:08:34.709 --> 00:08:34.719 align:start position:0%
dr king was able to take
 
00:08:38.469 --> 00:08:38.479 align:start position:0%
a potentially violent situation
 
00:08:40.589 --> 00:08:40.599 align:start position:0%
i can potentially
 
00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:42.880 align:start position:0%
confrontational situation
 
00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:44.800 align:start position:0%
and reduce it down to what i was being
 
00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:45.750 align:start position:0%
and reduce it down to what i was being
taught

00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:45.760 align:start position:0%
taught
 
00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:48.240 align:start position:0%
in my school at the time
 
00:08:51.269 --> 00:08:51.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:56.870 align:start position:0%
 
his

00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
his
 
00:08:58.790 --> 00:08:58.800 align:start position:0%
i have a dream speech and capture
 
00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
encapsulates that
 
00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:02.320 align:start position:0%
very well when he speaks about the fact
 
00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
that we need that he has a dream someday
 
00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:06.720 align:start position:0%
that his children will be judged by the
 
00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:08.800 align:start position:0%
quality of their character
 
00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:11.440 align:start position:0%
not by the color of their skin
 
00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:13.680 align:start position:0%
and we need to get back to that i think
 
00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:17.440 align:start position:0%
nationwide to talk about
 
00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:19.200 align:start position:0%
who the person is
 
00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
not whether they're
 
00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
black green brown orange
 
00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:24.470 align:start position:0%
black green brown orange
whatever

00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:24.480 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:26.800 align:start position:0%
that which is superficial
 
00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:27.829 align:start position:0%
that which is superficial
dr

00:09:27.829 --> 00:09:27.839 align:start position:0%
dr
 
00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:30.560 align:start position:0%
daniels has worked with ambassador young
 
00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:31.590 align:start position:0%
daniels has worked with ambassador young
and

00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:31.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
several other
 
00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:36.480 align:start position:0%
leaders in the historical black colleges
 
00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:40.320 align:start position:0%
and university community to develop this
 
00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:42.560 align:start position:0%
program for high school students
 
00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:45.040 align:start position:0%
and it can be adopted for
 
00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:47.760 align:start position:0%
kindergarten right on through
 
00:09:49.269 --> 00:09:49.279 align:start position:0%
it was originally
 
00:09:51.509 --> 00:09:51.519 align:start position:0%
sponsored by i have a handout there
 
00:09:53.269 --> 00:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
there from
 
00:09:53.279 --> 00:09:54.630 align:start position:0%
there from
mcgraw-hill

00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:54.640 align:start position:0%
mcgraw-hill
 
00:09:56.389 --> 00:09:56.399 align:start position:0%
but now two other
 
00:09:58.230 --> 00:09:58.240 align:start position:0%
primary school
 
00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
publishers have
 
00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:01.670 align:start position:0%
publishers have
joined

00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:01.680 align:start position:0%
joined
 
00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:04.480 align:start position:0%
on to this program as well to have their
 
00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:05.600 align:start position:0%
own uh
 
00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:07.200 align:start position:0%
types of these
 
00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
now i don't think i need to go through
 
00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:10.640 align:start position:0%
the credentials of
 
00:10:13.509 --> 00:10:13.519 align:start position:0%
uh ambassador young a pretty courageous
 
00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
uh man and his youth and he's now 93 and
 
00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:19.440 align:start position:0%
he's still fighting which is something i
 
00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:20.470 align:start position:0%
he's still fighting which is something i
think

00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:20.480 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
several of us can aspire to well let me
 
00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:24.880 align:start position:0%
talk about dr daniels for a half a
 
00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:27.440 align:start position:0%
second he's got his uh
 
00:10:30.389 --> 00:10:30.399 align:start position:0%
jd he's got a phd he grew up in spanish
 
00:10:30.399 --> 00:10:33.670 align:start position:0%
jd he's got a phd he grew up in spanish
harlem

00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:36.069 --> 00:10:36.079 align:start position:0%
he received full scholarship
 
00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:38.560 align:start position:0%
to dartmouth college so it's appropriate
 
00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:41.120 align:start position:0%
that he wants to try and get
 
00:10:44.069 --> 00:10:44.079 align:start position:0%
this program back
 
00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:48.880 align:start position:0%
into new hampshire to use this program
 
00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:50.870 align:start position:0%
into new hampshire to use this program
now

00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:52.880 align:start position:0%
if you take a look at your global
 
00:10:55.269 --> 00:10:55.279 align:start position:0%
perspective that
 
00:10:58.150 --> 00:10:58.160 align:start position:0%
was handed out it's the paperclip copy
 
00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:04.160 align:start position:0%
you have a background of the the entire
 
00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:07.360 align:start position:0%
program and how it is going to operate
 
00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:10.800 align:start position:0%
and what the uh guides are there
 
00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:12.160 align:start position:0%
i don't
 
00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:18.160 align:start position:0%
pretend to be an expert in education
 
00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:19.600 align:start position:0%
but i do know
 
00:11:22.389 --> 00:11:22.399 align:start position:0%
a good program when i see it the people
 
00:11:23.509 --> 00:11:23.519 align:start position:0%
talk about
 
00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:25.360 align:start position:0%
dr king
 
00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:29.360 align:start position:0%
and his ideals and his mission
 
00:11:30.389 --> 00:11:30.399 align:start position:0%
i want
 
00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
a program like that
 
00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:36.160 align:start position:0%
to be taught to my grandchildren and
 
00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:38.150 align:start position:0%
to be taught to my grandchildren and
great-grandchildren

00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:38.160 align:start position:0%
great-grandchildren
 
00:11:39.829 --> 00:11:39.839 align:start position:0%
um yeah
 
00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:41.120 align:start position:0%
i don't think that's going to happen for
 
00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:43.360 align:start position:0%
a while but anyway when it does i hope
 
00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:44.720 align:start position:0%
that they have
 
00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:48.560 align:start position:0%
that kind of education to teach
 
00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:49.750 align:start position:0%
that kind of education to teach
people

00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:49.760 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:11:52.389 --> 00:11:52.399 align:start position:0%
to appreciate one another
 
00:11:55.269 --> 00:11:55.279 align:start position:0%
and not to classify them by
 
00:11:58.389 --> 00:11:58.399 align:start position:0%
political party or skin color or
 
00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:00.560 align:start position:0%
hair color although there are some good
 
00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
this is why this bill has been
 
00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.670 align:start position:0%
this is why this bill has been
introduced

00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:07.680 align:start position:0%
introduced
 
00:12:10.069 --> 00:12:10.079 align:start position:0%
now it's particularly a point
 
00:12:10.079 --> 00:12:11.350 align:start position:0%
now it's particularly a point
and

00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:11.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:12.949 align:start position:0%
and
important

00:12:12.949 --> 00:12:12.959 align:start position:0%
important
 
00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
that we consider
 
00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:16.470 align:start position:0%
that we consider
what

00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:16.480 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:12:20.629 --> 00:12:20.639 align:start position:0%
dr young had dr young dr king had to say
 
00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:24.800 align:start position:0%
about this here in new hampshire
 
00:12:27.829 --> 00:12:27.839 align:start position:0%
from his uh i have a dream speech he
 
00:12:27.839 --> 00:12:28.629 align:start position:0%
from his uh i have a dream speech he
says

00:12:28.629 --> 00:12:28.639 align:start position:0%
says
 
00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:30.720 align:start position:0%
let us not seek to satisfy our thirst
 
00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:32.720 align:start position:0%
for freedom by drinking from the cup of
 
00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:34.720 align:start position:0%
bitterness or hatred
 
00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:37.040 align:start position:0%
we must ever conduct our struggle on the
 
00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:40.720 align:start position:0%
high plain of dignity and discipline
 
00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:42.800 align:start position:0%
he goes on further
 
00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:45.120 align:start position:0%
to remind us
 
00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:47.440 align:start position:0%
that freedom
 
00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
entails respect for one another
 
00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
and then he employs us to let freedom
 
00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:55.269 align:start position:0%
and then he employs us to let freedom
ring

00:12:55.269 --> 00:12:55.279 align:start position:0%
ring
 
00:12:57.829 --> 00:12:57.839 align:start position:0%
from the prodigious hilltops of new
 
00:12:57.839 --> 00:12:59.750 align:start position:0%
from the prodigious hilltops of new
hampshire

00:12:59.750 --> 00:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:13:01.509 --> 00:13:01.519 align:start position:0%
so i think
 
00:13:03.509 --> 00:13:03.519 align:start position:0%
this type of legislation
 
00:13:06.389 --> 00:13:06.399 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire is imminently
 
00:13:06.399 --> 00:13:09.110 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire is imminently
appropriate

00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
i know that dr
 
00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:12.560 align:start position:0%
daniels will be providing you with some
 
00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:14.160 align:start position:0%
additional information i've already sent
 
00:13:16.629 --> 00:13:16.639 align:start position:0%
you some information
 
00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:18.720 align:start position:0%
via email including links to different
 
00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:21.440 align:start position:0%
programs and different videos including
 
00:13:24.069 --> 00:13:24.079 align:start position:0%
a video from dr
 
00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
our ambassador young
 
00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:28.160 align:start position:0%
but i would be willing to answer any
 
00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:29.920 align:start position:0%
questions that anyone may have about
 
00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:32.160 align:start position:0%
this particular program
 
00:13:33.509 --> 00:13:33.519 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative are
 
00:13:35.829 --> 00:13:35.839 align:start position:0%
there questions from the committee yes
 
00:13:39.509 --> 00:13:39.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:42.069 --> 00:13:42.079 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and um thank you rep
 
00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
ulri for bringing this forward um this
 
00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:49.120 align:start position:0%
is a very timely and needed program i
 
00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
was wondering if you've looked at any
 
00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:52.720 align:start position:0%
other programs and
 
00:13:55.910 --> 00:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
why you went with this one
 
00:13:57.350 --> 00:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
actually i've seen several other
 
00:13:59.350 --> 00:13:59.360 align:start position:0%
programs from some of the educational
 
00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:01.120 align:start position:0%
conferences that i've attended over the
 
00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:02.560 align:start position:0%
last several years
 
00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
this one stood out though because it
 
00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:05.030 align:start position:0%
this one stood out though because it
took

00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
took
 
00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:06.720 align:start position:0%
uh something that seems to have been
 
00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:08.720 align:start position:0%
lost in the country
 
00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:12.240 align:start position:0%
that is the concept of uh
 
00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:14.230 align:start position:0%
that is the concept of uh
acceptance

00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:14.240 align:start position:0%
acceptance
 
00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:17.920 align:start position:0%
of an individual regardless of
 
00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:19.680 align:start position:0%
what they happen to be there are some
 
00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:22.160 align:start position:0%
programs out there that uh
 
00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:23.590 align:start position:0%
programs out there that uh
would

00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:23.600 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:26.560 align:start position:0%
classify individuals because of who or
 
00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:27.600 align:start position:0%
what or
 
00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
they are rather than
 
00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:31.760 align:start position:0%
beginning from the premise that we're
 
00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:32.880 align:start position:0%
all equal
 
00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:35.920 align:start position:0%
i'm kind of reminded of the uh
 
00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:37.760 align:start position:0%
song i learned as a
 
00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
as a child i was doing this with my wife
 
00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
in the car the other day jesus loves all
 
00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:44.160 align:start position:0%
the children better than yellow black
 
00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
and white they are all equal in his
 
00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:48.550 align:start position:0%
and white they are all equal in his
sight

00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:48.560 align:start position:0%
sight
 
00:14:50.389 --> 00:14:50.399 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question thank you
 
00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
00:14:54.790 --> 00:14:54.800 align:start position:0%
not yes representative moffett thank you
 
00:14:57.750 --> 00:14:57.760 align:start position:0%
mr thank you for your uh your measure
 
00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
and i applied the intent um yesterday we
 
00:15:02.389 --> 00:15:02.399 align:start position:0%
heard in this committee room
 
00:15:05.430 --> 00:15:05.440 align:start position:0%
proposals measures bills to uh mandate
 
00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:07.680 align:start position:0%
everything from a philosophy course to a
 
00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
labor course and more
 
00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:12.880 align:start position:0%
so my question hopefully follow up my
 
00:15:14.949 --> 00:15:14.959 align:start position:0%
question is do you envision this measure
 
00:15:17.430 --> 00:15:17.440 align:start position:0%
as being implemented as a standalone
 
00:15:18.629 --> 00:15:18.639 align:start position:0%
course or
 
00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:22.480 align:start position:0%
embedded in an existing course
 
00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:25.509 align:start position:0%
embedded in an existing course
yes

00:15:25.509 --> 00:15:25.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:27.440 align:start position:0%
either or so
 
00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:29.360 align:start position:0%
yes and the the way that this course is
 
00:15:32.069 --> 00:15:32.079 align:start position:0%
designed it could also be a monitored uh
 
00:15:33.990 --> 00:15:34.000 align:start position:0%
distance learning course
 
00:15:35.189 --> 00:15:35.199 align:start position:0%
which is
 
00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:37.360 align:start position:0%
one of the programs that dr daniels is
 
00:15:38.389 --> 00:15:38.399 align:start position:0%
involved in
 
00:15:40.949 --> 00:15:40.959 align:start position:0%
in a follow-up mr chair yes you may
 
00:15:42.310 --> 00:15:42.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:43.670 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:43.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:46.160 align:start position:0%
mathematics is relatively finite in
 
00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:48.800 align:start position:0%
terms of the body of knowledge that is
 
00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:49.749 align:start position:0%
terms of the body of knowledge that is
uh

00:15:49.749 --> 00:15:49.759 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:15:50.790 --> 00:15:50.800 align:start position:0%
is taught
 
00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:53.440 align:start position:0%
um having been in this business uh
 
00:15:56.949 --> 00:15:56.959 align:start position:0%
history or social studies is not
 
00:15:59.030 --> 00:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
when people taught history in the in the
 
00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:00.389 align:start position:0%
when people taught history in the in the
70s

00:16:00.389 --> 00:16:00.399 align:start position:0%
70s
 
00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:03.040 align:start position:0%
there was so much this 50 there's a half
 
00:16:05.829 --> 00:16:05.839 align:start position:0%
century more history now for students to
 
00:16:07.189 --> 00:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
be to learn
 
00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:10.160 align:start position:0%
in some fashion which is a challenge so
 
00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:12.240 align:start position:0%
what would you say to somebody from this
 
00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
would presumably be part of a social
 
00:16:15.829 --> 00:16:15.839 align:start position:0%
studies uh department thing what would
 
00:16:17.749 --> 00:16:17.759 align:start position:0%
you say to someone who would just
 
00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:19.360 align:start position:0%
respond that this is a good idea but
 
00:16:21.749 --> 00:16:21.759 align:start position:0%
they just are overwhelmed and they don't
 
00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:23.440 align:start position:0%
know how they can integrate it into what
 
00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:26.560 align:start position:0%
they're already trying to do
 
00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
a good choice of words there integrate
 
00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:29.829 align:start position:0%
a good choice of words there integrate
um

00:16:29.829 --> 00:16:29.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:29.839 --> 00:16:31.350 align:start position:0%
um
the

00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:31.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:16:33.670 --> 00:16:33.680 align:start position:0%
there are certain elements
 
00:16:37.189 --> 00:16:37.199 align:start position:0%
that transcend time
 
00:16:38.629 --> 00:16:38.639 align:start position:0%
and this
 
00:16:41.749 --> 00:16:41.759 align:start position:0%
concept of acceptance of an individual
 
00:16:43.509 --> 00:16:43.519 align:start position:0%
of treating an individual as an
 
00:16:46.069 --> 00:16:46.079 align:start position:0%
individual transcends
 
00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:48.000 align:start position:0%
the limits of time
 
00:16:49.189 --> 00:16:49.199 align:start position:0%
whether it's
 
00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
17 20
 
00:16:54.949 --> 00:16:54.959 align:start position:0%
18 20 19 20 or 20 20.
 
00:16:58.870 --> 00:16:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:00.480 align:start position:0%
then you're achieving
 
00:17:02.629 --> 00:17:02.639 align:start position:0%
a goal and that's what this course tries
 
00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
to do is try to instill in the student
 
00:17:07.829 --> 00:17:07.839 align:start position:0%
the concept within their own mind of of
 
00:17:11.110 --> 00:17:11.120 align:start position:0%
appreciation as they learn
 
00:17:13.029 --> 00:17:13.039 align:start position:0%
all the other programs
 
00:17:14.549 --> 00:17:14.559 align:start position:0%
this will
 
00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:16.000 align:start position:0%
fit into it
 
00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
you're right about 50 years of history
 
00:17:19.350 --> 00:17:19.360 align:start position:0%
some of it which i wish we didn't have
 
00:17:22.549 --> 00:17:22.559 align:start position:0%
to live but was there
 
00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:17:25.990 --> 00:17:26.000 align:start position:0%
thank you further representative ellison
 
00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:27.520 align:start position:0%
uh there's probably a point of
 
00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
information i think uh
 
00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:31.600 align:start position:0%
i'm on the commission
 
00:17:33.669 --> 00:17:33.679 align:start position:0%
holocaust commission it's the commission
 
00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:35.840 align:start position:0%
on the holocaust and genocide studies
 
00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
and i serve along with dan wolf who was
 
00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
on this committee
 
00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:41.360 align:start position:0%
and that
 
00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:43.440 align:start position:0%
that's a law that when the commission
 
00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
was set up and is now
 
00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:47.360 align:start position:0%
getting to the point where the final
 
00:17:49.270 --> 00:17:49.280 align:start position:0%
hearing on the rules will take place
 
00:17:50.390 --> 00:17:50.400 align:start position:0%
next month
 
00:17:52.789 --> 00:17:52.799 align:start position:0%
at the state board of education and then
 
00:17:54.310 --> 00:17:54.320 align:start position:0%
move to jail car
 
00:17:56.150 --> 00:17:56.160 align:start position:0%
everything that's in this bill is
 
00:17:58.390 --> 00:17:58.400 align:start position:0%
included in that that particular piece
 
00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:01.280 align:start position:0%
of legislation uh and there are some
 
00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:03.440 align:start position:0%
mandates in there in terms of when
 
00:18:05.029 --> 00:18:05.039 align:start position:0%
things would be taught how they would be
 
00:18:07.750 --> 00:18:07.760 align:start position:0%
taught uh it's very specific so i'm just
 
00:18:09.909 --> 00:18:09.919 align:start position:0%
simply adding that as
 
00:18:13.029 --> 00:18:13.039 align:start position:0%
sort of additional information to
 
00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:14.400 align:start position:0%
this piece of him for this piece of
 
00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:16.870 align:start position:0%
this piece of him for this piece of
legislation

00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:16.880 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:19.360 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:18:23.029 --> 00:18:23.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:25.120 align:start position:0%
yes representative tanner
 
00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:27.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:29.360 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question i
 
00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:31.440 align:start position:0%
was wondering if you could explain
 
00:18:33.430 --> 00:18:33.440 align:start position:0%
what how you think
 
00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
this particular topic is being taught in
 
00:18:37.909 --> 00:18:37.919 align:start position:0%
high schools in new hampshire right now
 
00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:43.200 align:start position:0%
and um how this one this particular
 
00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
curriculum because it is a curriculum
 
00:18:47.669 --> 00:18:47.679 align:start position:0%
how it um
 
00:18:49.029 --> 00:18:49.039 align:start position:0%
differs from
 
00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:53.120 align:start position:0%
uh divisive concepts or how it how
 
00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:55.200 align:start position:0%
it eludes the
 
00:18:57.669 --> 00:18:57.679 align:start position:0%
statute that we now have that we cannot
 
00:18:59.750 --> 00:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
teach divisive concepts
 
00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:04.640 align:start position:0%
i don't understand your question
 
00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:07.360 align:start position:0%
so my fir it's a two-part question
 
00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
question part number one is how do you
 
00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:12.320 align:start position:0%
think or what do you think
 
00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
new hampshire schools are doing
 
00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.350 align:start position:0%
new hampshire schools are doing
currently

00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:15.360 align:start position:0%
currently
 
00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:18.080 align:start position:0%
teaching this particular subject
 
00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:19.600 align:start position:0%
and second of all
 
00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
because there was this outcry that you
 
00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:24.720 align:start position:0%
know new hampshire schools were teaching
 
00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:26.310 align:start position:0%
know new hampshire schools were teaching
crt

00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:26.320 align:start position:0%
crt
 
00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:28.880 align:start position:0%
which they're not but they were accused
 
00:19:31.990 --> 00:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
of that we had the divisive concept
 
00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.190 align:start position:0%
of that we had the divisive concept
statute

00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:33.200 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:34.400 align:start position:0%
come through
 
00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
uh the legislature and so what i'm
 
00:19:39.669 --> 00:19:39.679 align:start position:0%
asking in the second part is
 
00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
compared to what you think we're
 
00:19:43.669 --> 00:19:43.679 align:start position:0%
teaching in schools today
 
00:19:46.150 --> 00:19:46.160 align:start position:0%
how is this different and how does it
 
00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:47.590 align:start position:0%
how is this different and how does it
not

00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:47.600 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:19:52.789 --> 00:19:52.799 align:start position:0%
fall under divisive concepts thank you
 
00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:55.360 align:start position:0%
want to answer your uh your
 
00:19:58.390 --> 00:19:58.400 align:start position:0%
second question first
 
00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:00.640 align:start position:0%
it has nothing to do with divisive
 
00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:02.720 align:start position:0%
concepts it's not teaching a divisive
 
00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:04.070 align:start position:0%
concepts it's not teaching a divisive
concept

00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
concept
 
00:20:05.029 --> 00:20:05.039 align:start position:0%
on the
 
00:20:08.789 --> 00:20:08.799 align:start position:0%
on the other hand what his teaching is
 
00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
uh as was said by representative moffat
 
00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
more of an integrated
 
00:20:16.549 --> 00:20:16.559 align:start position:0%
um point of view of accepting each
 
00:20:18.830 --> 00:20:18.840 align:start position:0%
individual for themselves
 
00:20:21.909 --> 00:20:21.919 align:start position:0%
regardless of anything that may separate
 
00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:26.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
heritage or ethnic background or
 
00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:30.080 align:start position:0%
anything else rather than
 
00:20:33.909 --> 00:20:33.919 align:start position:0%
allow the separation factors to come in
 
00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:37.120 align:start position:0%
you talk about teaching each individual
 
00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:39.200 align:start position:0%
as an individual
 
00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:40.880 align:start position:0%
not as
 
00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:42.149 align:start position:0%
not as
a

00:20:42.149 --> 00:20:42.159 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:44.640 align:start position:0%
chartreuse four-legged
 
00:20:48.549 --> 00:20:48.559 align:start position:0%
or whatever into per uh thing you teach
 
00:20:52.149 --> 00:20:52.159 align:start position:0%
them as a human being
 
00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
which unfortunately you know uh you you
 
00:20:57.830 --> 00:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
take a look back at world war one and uh
 
00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:00.640 align:start position:0%
the propaganda of uh wilson at the time
 
00:21:02.390 --> 00:21:02.400 align:start position:0%
was the hun
 
00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:03.510 align:start position:0%
was the hun
well

00:21:03.510 --> 00:21:03.520 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:05.360 align:start position:0%
you know those guys didn't want to be in
 
00:21:07.029 --> 00:21:07.039 align:start position:0%
in the trenches any more than the french
 
00:21:08.390 --> 00:21:08.400 align:start position:0%
or the british didn't wanted to be in
 
00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
the trenches
 
00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:10.870 align:start position:0%
the trenches
ah

00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:10.880 align:start position:0%
ah
 
00:21:14.549 --> 00:21:14.559 align:start position:0%
you have to then 1914 christmas kind of
 
00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
taught that but you need to
 
00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:19.120 align:start position:0%
that's why
 
00:21:21.190 --> 00:21:21.200 align:start position:0%
there's no correlation so you can't
 
00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:23.360 align:start position:0%
answer your second part of the question
 
00:21:25.270 --> 00:21:25.280 align:start position:0%
and the first part of the question was
 
00:21:27.029 --> 00:21:27.039 align:start position:0%
what do i think is being taught in in
 
00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:28.400 align:start position:0%
schools right now
 
00:21:30.789 --> 00:21:30.799 align:start position:0%
not enough about how to treat each other
 
00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
yes we need to we have a number of cards
 
00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:38.720 align:start position:0%
here also so we need to
 
00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:49.760 --> 00:22:04.070 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:05.990 --> 00:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
well if you're afraid to teach
 
00:22:07.909 --> 00:22:07.919 align:start position:0%
sergeant of truth
 
00:22:07.919 --> 00:22:08.789 align:start position:0%
sergeant of truth
i'm

00:22:08.789 --> 00:22:08.799 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
00:22:11.270 --> 00:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
sorry for you
 
00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:14.720 align:start position:0%
because that's not divisive
 
00:22:16.789 --> 00:22:16.799 align:start position:0%
represent representative cornell
 
00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:18.640 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:21.360 align:start position:0%
question i just it's just a question of
 
00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:23.360 align:start position:0%
are you proposing this particular
 
00:22:25.909 --> 00:22:25.919 align:start position:0%
curriculum or or just that these kind of
 
00:22:29.029 --> 00:22:29.039 align:start position:0%
materials get covered in a in a class or
 
00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:30.720 align:start position:0%
or um
 
00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:32.320 align:start position:0%
dr d
 
00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:35.120 align:start position:0%
is it daniel's dr dana's particular
 
00:22:37.990 --> 00:22:38.000 align:start position:0%
course material
 
00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:40.320 align:start position:0%
um the particular course material is the
 
00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:41.840 align:start position:0%
one that has been presented to us
 
00:22:43.190 --> 00:22:43.200 align:start position:0%
several other states and they picked
 
00:22:46.149 --> 00:22:46.159 align:start position:0%
that up but uh simon and schuster who
 
00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:48.240 align:start position:0%
have also joined along with harper
 
00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:49.270 align:start position:0%
have also joined along with harper
collins

00:22:49.270 --> 00:22:49.280 align:start position:0%
collins
 
00:22:51.270 --> 00:22:51.280 align:start position:0%
in uh picking up the same thing so
 
00:22:53.669 --> 00:22:53.679 align:start position:0%
they're teaching essentially the same or
 
00:22:56.070 --> 00:22:56.080 align:start position:0%
the printing essentially the same course
 
00:22:59.029 --> 00:22:59.039 align:start position:0%
material by the the three
 
00:23:02.070 --> 00:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
educational uh publishers
 
00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
follow-up yes
 
00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:04.880 align:start position:0%
so you don't care if it's this
 
00:23:06.789 --> 00:23:06.799 align:start position:0%
particular curriculum as long as these
 
00:23:09.350 --> 00:23:09.360 align:start position:0%
materials get covered in school that's
 
00:23:11.029 --> 00:23:11.039 align:start position:0%
correct thank you thank you
 
00:23:11.039 --> 00:23:12.950 align:start position:0%
correct thank you thank you
president

00:23:12.950 --> 00:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
president

thank you very much mr chair thank you
 
00:23:16.149 --> 00:23:16.159 align:start position:0%
very much for taking my question
 
00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:18.240 align:start position:0%
representative would would it be your
 
00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:20.080 align:start position:0%
intention for this um
 
00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:21.270 align:start position:0%
intention for this um
um

00:23:21.270 --> 00:23:21.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:24.470 --> 00:23:24.480 align:start position:0%
this uh proposed um legislation to also
 
00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:28.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:30.480 align:start position:0%
uh several non-public schools are
 
00:23:33.029 --> 00:23:33.039 align:start position:0%
already teaching this particular type of
 
00:23:36.390 --> 00:23:36.400 align:start position:0%
curriculum of their own uh degree but
 
00:23:38.789 --> 00:23:38.799 align:start position:0%
any uh since we don't have any control
 
00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
over other than broadly through the uh
 
00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:44.240 align:start position:0%
department of education regarding the
 
00:23:46.549 --> 00:23:46.559 align:start position:0%
curriculum that the non-public schools
 
00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
have the public schools which includes
 
00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:51.360 align:start position:0%
charter schools
 
00:23:52.710 --> 00:23:52.720 align:start position:0%
this would be included in their
 
00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:54.390 align:start position:0%
this would be included in their
curriculum

00:23:54.390 --> 00:23:54.400 align:start position:0%
curriculum
 
00:23:56.230 --> 00:23:56.240 align:start position:0%
follow up on that yes
 
00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
first of all charter charter public
 
00:24:05.909 --> 00:24:05.919 align:start position:0%
schools uh would need to be called out
 
00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
specifically in the statute uh in order
 
00:24:11.110 --> 00:24:11.120 align:start position:0%
for them to for that to apply
 
00:24:13.990 --> 00:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
um uh would would it also be your
 
00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
intention though for um
 
00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:19.200 align:start position:0%
for this um this policy to apply to
 
00:24:21.029 --> 00:24:21.039 align:start position:0%
non-public schools that are under
 
00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:26.470 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:26.480 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:24:28.390 --> 00:24:28.400 align:start position:0%
that would include pinkerton i believe
 
00:24:30.390 --> 00:24:30.400 align:start position:0%
is one of the such school and
 
00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:32.640 align:start position:0%
technically alvirne from the district in
 
00:24:34.710 --> 00:24:34.720 align:start position:0%
which i'm involved in
 
00:24:35.909 --> 00:24:35.919 align:start position:0%
is uh
 
00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:38.320 align:start position:0%
uh i mean the school itself is a trust
 
00:24:40.789 --> 00:24:40.799 align:start position:0%
private academy uh atkinson academy is
 
00:24:42.390 --> 00:24:42.400 align:start position:0%
another one of those little weird
 
00:24:44.789 --> 00:24:44.799 align:start position:0%
leftovers from the 18th century 19th
 
00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
century brother so yes
 
00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:49.520 align:start position:0%
great thank you
 
00:24:50.950 --> 00:24:50.960 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions from the
 
00:24:52.710 --> 00:24:52.720 align:start position:0%
committee not seeing hands thank you
 
00:24:55.750 --> 00:24:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:57.830 --> 00:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
like to call forward uh
 
00:25:00.310 --> 00:25:00.320 align:start position:0%
megan tuttle

of time i do have some written testimony
 
00:25:26.789 --> 00:25:26.799 align:start position:0%
that i will
 
00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:28.640 align:start position:0%
pass out in a moment for the record my
 
00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:30.240 align:start position:0%
name is megan tuttle president for nea
 
00:25:32.149 --> 00:25:32.159 align:start position:0%
new hampshire representing more than 17
 
00:25:33.669 --> 00:25:33.679 align:start position:0%
000 educators across the state of new
 
00:25:33.679 --> 00:25:34.630 align:start position:0%
000 educators across the state of new
hampshire

00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:34.640 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:36.640 align:start position:0%
we are here today in opposition to house
 
00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:41.600 align:start position:0%
basically there's there's two points
 
00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:43.120 align:start position:0%
i'll make here um because i know there's
 
00:25:44.950 --> 00:25:44.960 align:start position:0%
a lot of other testimony the first one
 
00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
as representative tanner um already
 
00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:50.640 align:start position:0%
alluded to there is fear among educators
 
00:25:52.390 --> 00:25:52.400 align:start position:0%
in the state today there's a lot of fear
 
00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
i hear from them they're in the
 
00:25:55.909 --> 00:25:55.919 align:start position:0%
classroom they're they're fearful of
 
00:25:57.430 --> 00:25:57.440 align:start position:0%
what they can and can't say in the
 
00:25:58.950 --> 00:25:58.960 align:start position:0%
classroom anymore because of the banned
 
00:26:00.870 --> 00:26:00.880 align:start position:0%
concepts um
 
00:26:02.149 --> 00:26:02.159 align:start position:0%
and i think this
 
00:26:03.029 --> 00:26:03.039 align:start position:0%
is going to add to that as
 
00:26:05.190 --> 00:26:05.200 align:start position:0%
representative tanner said this is true
 
00:26:06.870 --> 00:26:06.880 align:start position:0%
this is what's happening the educators
 
00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:08.400 align:start position:0%
are letting me know that this is
 
00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:10.480 align:start position:0%
happening in the schools today the other
 
00:26:12.310 --> 00:26:12.320 align:start position:0%
piece of this is partially what
 
00:26:14.310 --> 00:26:14.320 align:start position:0%
representative elliott had mentioned and
 
00:26:16.630 --> 00:26:16.640 align:start position:0%
alluded to earlier that
 
00:26:18.630 --> 00:26:18.640 align:start position:0%
in 2020 the governor signed into law the
 
00:26:22.390 --> 00:26:22.400 align:start position:0%
commission pursuant to rsa 133 e2f
 
00:26:23.830 --> 00:26:23.840 align:start position:0%
which made the recommendations to the
 
00:26:25.430 --> 00:26:25.440 align:start position:0%
state board of education adopting rules
 
00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
around holocaust and genocide education
 
00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:29.120 align:start position:0%
i believe um
 
00:26:31.669 --> 00:26:31.679 align:start position:0%
it's been the hearing has been delayed a
 
00:26:33.110 --> 00:26:33.120 align:start position:0%
few times i was at the state board of
 
00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:34.320 align:start position:0%
education meeting last week and it was
 
00:26:36.230 --> 00:26:36.240 align:start position:0%
delayed again but that's work that's
 
00:26:37.590 --> 00:26:37.600 align:start position:0%
been going on that's included in this
 
00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:40.320 align:start position:0%
already so this is really duplicate of
 
00:26:42.390 --> 00:26:42.400 align:start position:0%
what's already happening and will be
 
00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:43.750 align:start position:0%
what's already happening and will be
happening

00:26:43.750 --> 00:26:43.760 align:start position:0%
happening
 
00:26:45.029 --> 00:26:45.039 align:start position:0%
in there
 
00:26:48.149 --> 00:26:48.159 align:start position:0%
there's also rsa 189 11
 
00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:50.080 align:start position:0%
ij referenced in the bill it already
 
00:26:51.990 --> 00:26:52.000 align:start position:0%
states new hampshire government civics
 
00:26:53.909 --> 00:26:53.919 align:start position:0%
courses include instruction and how
 
00:26:56.070 --> 00:26:56.080 align:start position:0%
intolerance bigotry anti-semitism
 
00:26:57.750 --> 00:26:57.760 align:start position:0%
national ethnic racial or religious
 
00:26:59.350 --> 00:26:59.360 align:start position:0%
hatred and discrimination have evolved
 
00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:00.880 align:start position:0%
in the past and can evolved into
 
00:27:02.470 --> 00:27:02.480 align:start position:0%
genocide and mass violence such as the
 
00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:04.240 align:start position:0%
holocaust and how to prevent the
 
00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:07.120 align:start position:0%
evolution of such practices um basically
 
00:27:09.029 --> 00:27:09.039 align:start position:0%
this is this is already in statute it's
 
00:27:11.110 --> 00:27:11.120 align:start position:0%
already in rules that are already
 
00:27:12.710 --> 00:27:12.720 align:start position:0%
in place and so
 
00:27:14.789 --> 00:27:14.799 align:start position:0%
i'll leave it at that for now thank you
 
00:27:17.029 --> 00:27:17.039 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh megan i have a
 
00:27:18.789 --> 00:27:18.799 align:start position:0%
question for you it should be a quick
 
00:27:18.799 --> 00:27:19.510 align:start position:0%
question for you it should be a quick
one

00:27:19.510 --> 00:27:19.520 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:27:21.029 --> 00:27:21.039 align:start position:0%
i'm sure that you have the opportunity
 
00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:22.720 align:start position:0%
to go around to all the schools within
 
00:27:24.389 --> 00:27:24.399 align:start position:0%
the state and observe in classrooms
 
00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:26.320 align:start position:0%
what's going on
 
00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:28.710 align:start position:0%
what's going on
hopefully

00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:28.720 align:start position:0%
hopefully
 
00:27:32.070 --> 00:27:32.080 align:start position:0%
is it your perception or observation
 
00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:32.950 align:start position:0%
is it your perception or observation
that

00:27:32.950 --> 00:27:32.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:27:35.110 --> 00:27:35.120 align:start position:0%
issues such as dealing with the wagers
 
00:27:38.070 --> 00:27:38.080 align:start position:0%
in northwestern china and their
 
00:27:40.789 --> 00:27:40.799 align:start position:0%
enslavement in various labor camps etc
 
00:27:43.269 --> 00:27:43.279 align:start position:0%
uh issues dealing with the holocaust
 
00:27:46.070 --> 00:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
issues dealing with this topic that we
 
00:27:47.669 --> 00:27:47.679 align:start position:0%
passed within the genocide that
 
00:27:47.679 --> 00:27:48.870 align:start position:0%
passed within the genocide that
represented

00:27:48.870 --> 00:27:48.880 align:start position:0%
represented
 
00:27:51.909 --> 00:27:51.919 align:start position:0%
ellison referred to are being taught in
 
00:27:53.830 --> 00:27:53.840 align:start position:0%
the schools right now
 
00:27:55.590 --> 00:27:55.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um i have not
 
00:27:57.430 --> 00:27:57.440 align:start position:0%
been to every class obviously in the
 
00:27:59.909 --> 00:27:59.919 align:start position:0%
state and um the pandemic is limited
 
00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:01.440 align:start position:0%
when i'm able to actually go into the
 
00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
classroom so my interaction has been
 
00:28:04.630 --> 00:28:04.640 align:start position:0%
limited to speaking with educators
 
00:28:06.549 --> 00:28:06.559 align:start position:0%
across the state but i can say that i do
 
00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:08.000 align:start position:0%
believe those are being taught in new
 
00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire i can't say for sure in every
 
00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:11.600 align:start position:0%
class but i'm sure in some they are
 
00:28:13.430 --> 00:28:13.440 align:start position:0%
thank you very much further questions
 
00:28:16.149 --> 00:28:16.159 align:start position:0%
from the committee
 
00:28:17.750 --> 00:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
not singing hands thank you very much
 
00:28:44.310 --> 00:28:44.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:46.549 --> 00:28:46.559 align:start position:0%
ah now it's done thank you uh good

aft
 
00:28:54.070 --> 00:28:54.080 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
00:28:55.669 --> 00:28:55.679 align:start position:0%
uh the other teachers union in the state
 
00:28:58.389 --> 00:28:58.399 align:start position:0%
we represent about 3 500 teachers para
 
00:28:58.399 --> 00:28:59.830 align:start position:0%
we represent about 3 500 teachers para
educators

00:28:59.830 --> 00:28:59.840 align:start position:0%
educators
 
00:29:01.510 --> 00:29:01.520 align:start position:0%
school support staff public service
 
00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
employees and
 
00:29:05.909 --> 00:29:05.919 align:start position:0%
higher ed staff across the state
 
00:29:09.590 --> 00:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
and i'm here this morning to talk about
 
00:29:10.710 --> 00:29:10.720 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:13.200 align:start position:0%
not because we oppose teaching on the
 
00:29:15.029 --> 00:29:15.039 align:start position:0%
civil rights era we actually you know
 
00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:16.960 align:start position:0%
thoroughly encourage that and notice the
 
00:29:19.350 --> 00:29:19.360 align:start position:0%
part of any good
 
00:29:22.389 --> 00:29:22.399 align:start position:0%
course in american history but we
 
00:29:25.669 --> 00:29:25.679 align:start position:0%
are concerned that by passing a specific
 
00:29:25.679 --> 00:29:26.710 align:start position:0%
are concerned that by passing a specific
law

00:29:26.710 --> 00:29:26.720 align:start position:0%
law
 
00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:27.990 align:start position:0%
law
requiring

00:29:27.990 --> 00:29:28.000 align:start position:0%
requiring
 
00:29:31.029 --> 00:29:31.039 align:start position:0%
teaching as described in this bill
 
00:29:33.750 --> 00:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:37.510 --> 00:29:37.520 align:start position:0%
it would take it out its full sweep of
 
00:29:40.230 --> 00:29:40.240 align:start position:0%
a course of american history aft firmly
 
00:29:41.669 --> 00:29:41.679 align:start position:0%
believes in providing students with a
 
00:29:44.070 --> 00:29:44.080 align:start position:0%
robust engaging factual u.s history
 
00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
education so that they can understand
 
00:29:48.070 --> 00:29:48.080 align:start position:0%
how our nation was formed and the
 
00:29:49.830 --> 00:29:49.840 align:start position:0%
changes has undergone through the years
 
00:29:52.149 --> 00:29:52.159 align:start position:0%
up to including the present time
 
00:29:54.710 --> 00:29:54.720 align:start position:0%
this proposal of study is laudable as it
 
00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:55.590 align:start position:0%
this proposal of study is laudable as it
is

00:29:55.590 --> 00:29:55.600 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:29:57.110 --> 00:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
needs a lot of background knowledge for
 
00:29:58.950 --> 00:29:58.960 align:start position:0%
students to fully grasp the significance
 
00:30:01.510 --> 00:30:01.520 align:start position:0%
of the civil rights era to our nation
 
00:30:03.029 --> 00:30:03.039 align:start position:0%
for example students must first
 
00:30:04.070 --> 00:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
comprehend the evils of the
 
00:30:06.630 --> 00:30:06.640 align:start position:0%
transatlantic slave trade and slavery as
 
00:30:08.870 --> 00:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
it existed in the united states
 
00:30:10.389 --> 00:30:10.399 align:start position:0%
students need to see how the tactics of
 
00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:12.240 align:start position:0%
the abolitionist suffragist and labor
 
00:30:14.310 --> 00:30:14.320 align:start position:0%
movement as well as the strength of
 
00:30:16.230 --> 00:30:16.240 align:start position:0%
community within black churches helped
 
00:30:18.549 --> 00:30:18.559 align:start position:0%
shape the individuals and organizations
 
00:30:20.870 --> 00:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
that made up the civil rights movement
 
00:30:22.470 --> 00:30:22.480 align:start position:0%
students need to understand that free
 
00:30:24.230 --> 00:30:24.240 align:start position:0%
black men gained the right to vote be
 
00:30:25.830 --> 00:30:25.840 align:start position:0%
educated and own property during
 
00:30:28.389 --> 00:30:28.399 align:start position:0%
reconstruction the 1870s then those
 
00:30:30.149 --> 00:30:30.159 align:start position:0%
rights were taken away or severely
 
00:30:33.269 --> 00:30:33.279 align:start position:0%
curtailed through poll taxes literacy
 
00:30:35.269 --> 00:30:35.279 align:start position:0%
tests segregation laws and peonage
 
00:30:37.190 --> 00:30:37.200 align:start position:0%
starting in the 1890s
 
00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:38.480 align:start position:0%
students need to understand the
 
00:30:40.789 --> 00:30:40.799 align:start position:0%
experience of segregation the jim crow
 
00:30:40.799 --> 00:30:41.669 align:start position:0%
experience of segregation the jim crow
era

00:30:41.669 --> 00:30:41.679 align:start position:0%
era
 
00:30:43.590 --> 00:30:43.600 align:start position:0%
vigilante action of lynchings and
 
00:30:45.590 --> 00:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
violent outbreaks in places such as
 
00:30:49.029 --> 00:30:49.039 align:start position:0%
wilmington north carolina in 1898 elaine
 
00:30:52.029 --> 00:30:52.039 align:start position:0%
arkansas in 1919 and tulsa oklahoma in
 
00:30:52.039 --> 00:30:53.669 align:start position:0%
arkansas in 1919 and tulsa oklahoma in
1921.

00:30:53.669 --> 00:30:53.679 align:start position:0%
1921.
 
00:30:55.350 --> 00:30:55.360 align:start position:0%
these are some of the background that
 
00:30:57.269 --> 00:30:57.279 align:start position:0%
students need to put the civil rights
 
00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:00.720 align:start position:0%
era in context in united states history
 
00:31:02.950 --> 00:31:02.960 align:start position:0%
it is necessary so they can understand
 
00:31:04.789 --> 00:31:04.799 align:start position:0%
what it was that the individuals and
 
00:31:06.710 --> 00:31:06.720 align:start position:0%
organizations of the civil rights
 
00:31:09.350 --> 00:31:09.360 align:start position:0%
movement were seeking to overcome
 
00:31:11.269 --> 00:31:11.279 align:start position:0%
and comprehend their successes and their
 
00:31:14.549 --> 00:31:14.559 align:start position:0%
failures and realize what yet remains
 
00:31:14.559 --> 00:31:15.590 align:start position:0%
failures and realize what yet remains
undone

00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
undone
 
00:31:17.509 --> 00:31:17.519 align:start position:0%
as part of a robust well-rounded
 
00:31:20.389 --> 00:31:20.399 align:start position:0%
curriculum of u.s history students would
 
00:31:22.789 --> 00:31:22.799 align:start position:0%
encounter these concepts before they
 
00:31:24.870 --> 00:31:24.880 align:start position:0%
study the civil rights era if a
 
00:31:26.630 --> 00:31:26.640 align:start position:0%
stand-alone law required teaching of
 
00:31:29.190 --> 00:31:29.200 align:start position:0%
civil rights era past
 
00:31:30.870 --> 00:31:30.880 align:start position:0%
some of those building blocks might be
 
00:31:33.029 --> 00:31:33.039 align:start position:0%
shortchanged in the rush to get to this
 
00:31:33.039 --> 00:31:33.990 align:start position:0%
shortchanged in the rush to get to this
unit

00:31:33.990 --> 00:31:34.000 align:start position:0%
unit
 
00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:34.789 align:start position:0%
unit
so

00:31:34.789 --> 00:31:34.799 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:31:37.029 --> 00:31:37.039 align:start position:0%
as described in this bill
 
00:31:38.950 --> 00:31:38.960 align:start position:0%
if this were were
 
00:31:41.430 --> 00:31:41.440 align:start position:0%
put into law it might
 
00:31:44.149 --> 00:31:44.159 align:start position:0%
unbalance some of the social studies
 
00:31:46.870 --> 00:31:46.880 align:start position:0%
courses uh in american history as
 
00:31:48.389 --> 00:31:48.399 align:start position:0%
teachers try and get to this which is
 
00:31:50.070 --> 00:31:50.080 align:start position:0%
man did um
 
00:31:52.710 --> 00:31:52.720 align:start position:0%
and rush past other things
 
00:31:55.269 --> 00:31:55.279 align:start position:0%
as someone alluded to earlier there's 50
 
00:31:56.470 --> 00:31:56.480 align:start position:0%
more years of history than there were
 
00:31:57.990 --> 00:31:58.000 align:start position:0%
when some of us took it
 
00:32:00.070 --> 00:32:00.080 align:start position:0%
and if you're hurrying to get to this
 
00:32:01.350 --> 00:32:01.360 align:start position:0%
you might miss some of those other
 
00:32:03.190 --> 00:32:03.200 align:start position:0%
important building blocks
 
00:32:05.190 --> 00:32:05.200 align:start position:0%
the appropriate place for this proposal
 
00:32:06.870 --> 00:32:06.880 align:start position:0%
is at the new hampshire department of
 
00:32:08.870 --> 00:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
education through inclusion in our
 
00:32:10.950 --> 00:32:10.960 align:start position:0%
revised state standards or frameworks
 
00:32:12.630 --> 00:32:12.640 align:start position:0%
for social studies
 
00:32:14.230 --> 00:32:14.240 align:start position:0%
that way we can be sure that the civil
 
00:32:15.830 --> 00:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
rights era is taught in a way that
 
00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
respects the need for all the necessary
 
00:32:19.509 --> 00:32:19.519 align:start position:0%
prerequisite learning
 
00:32:21.350 --> 00:32:21.360 align:start position:0%
for a full and robust understanding of
 
00:32:22.630 --> 00:32:22.640 align:start position:0%
those ideas
 
00:32:24.149 --> 00:32:24.159 align:start position:0%
we can be sure that the intended
 
00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
enduring understanding of this unit that
 
00:32:27.990 --> 00:32:28.000 align:start position:0%
hatred based on immutable
 
00:32:29.990 --> 00:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
characteristics produces profound
 
00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:31.760 align:start position:0%
injustice and should always be worked
 
00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:33.029 align:start position:0%
injustice and should always be worked
against

00:32:33.029 --> 00:32:33.039 align:start position:0%
against
 
00:32:34.470 --> 00:32:34.480 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure that idea does not
 
00:32:35.990 --> 00:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
get diluted because students are
 
00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:37.590 align:start position:0%
get diluted because students are
unprepared

00:32:37.590 --> 00:32:37.600 align:start position:0%
unprepared
 
00:32:38.950 --> 00:32:38.960 align:start position:0%
with the background knowledge that they
 
00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:40.310 align:start position:0%
with the background knowledge that they
need

00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:40.320 align:start position:0%
need
 
00:32:41.750 --> 00:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire state framework on
 
00:32:44.070 --> 00:32:44.080 align:start position:0%
social studies was last updated in 2006
 
00:32:45.669 --> 00:32:45.679 align:start position:0%
and is supposed to be updated every 10
 
00:32:48.149 --> 00:32:48.159 align:start position:0%
years it's overdue but it's in process
 
00:32:49.509 --> 00:32:49.519 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:32:52.549 --> 00:32:52.559 align:start position:0%

the focus of the bill to get this into
 
00:34:24.470 --> 00:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
the social studies standards this is an
 
00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
appropriate thing to to be looking at it
 
00:34:29.829 --> 00:34:29.839 align:start position:0%

00:34:34.149 --> 00:34:34.159 align:start position:0%
vacuum okay it has to be part of
 
00:34:36.389 --> 00:34:36.399 align:start position:0%
the sequence of
 
00:34:38.790 --> 00:34:38.800 align:start position:0%
events you can't look at you know you
 
00:34:39.829 --> 00:34:39.839 align:start position:0%
can't look at the facts without the
 
00:34:39.839 --> 00:34:41.589 align:start position:0%
can't look at the facts without the
causes

00:34:41.589 --> 00:34:41.599 align:start position:0%

wanted to speak and support against
 
00:35:18.630 --> 00:35:18.640 align:start position:0%
or against this particular bill you
 
00:35:21.109 --> 00:35:21.119 align:start position:0%

the others have done as well
 
00:35:25.589 --> 00:35:25.599 align:start position:0%
you would have to fill out a pink card

session as well
 
00:35:34.310 --> 00:35:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:36.150 --> 00:35:36.160 align:start position:0%
and but while you're making your mind up
 
00:35:37.349 --> 00:35:37.359 align:start position:0%

world
 
00:36:40.470 --> 00:36:40.480 align:start position:0%
so happy to be here today first of all
 
00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
i'd like to start off by saying i love
 
00:36:44.790 --> 00:36:44.800 align:start position:0%
the idea of learning about what's going
 
00:36:47.430 --> 00:36:47.440 align:start position:0%
on in other countries i think that many
 
00:36:49.589 --> 00:36:49.599 align:start position:0%
people in the united states are not in
 
00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:52.720 align:start position:0%
touch as a nation with other countries
 
00:36:55.150 --> 00:36:55.160 align:start position:0%
their trials and tribulations their
 
00:36:57.270 --> 00:36:57.280 align:start position:0%
contributions including the immense
 
00:37:00.950 --> 00:37:00.960 align:start position:0%
resources we all depend on from them
 
00:37:08.230 --> 00:37:08.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:10.470 --> 00:37:10.480 align:start position:0%
instead it's being used
 
00:37:13.510 --> 00:37:13.520 align:start position:0%
this noble idea of learning about others
 
00:37:16.710 --> 00:37:16.720 align:start position:0%
and turns it on its head
 
00:37:18.950 --> 00:37:18.960 align:start position:0%
by using others faults to make our
 
00:37:21.910 --> 00:37:21.920 align:start position:0%
faults look less bad instead of learning
 
00:37:23.990 --> 00:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
about other nations including the great
 
00:37:26.550 --> 00:37:26.560 align:start position:0%
cultural practices that incredibly
 
00:37:29.990 --> 00:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
support people in their weakest moments
 
00:37:32.310 --> 00:37:32.320 align:start position:0%
or what great inventions or geniuses
 
00:37:34.790 --> 00:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
there are out there as well as the bad
 
00:37:37.750 --> 00:37:37.760 align:start position:0%
which i'm not promoting we leave out
 
00:37:38.790 --> 00:37:38.800 align:start position:0%
in fact
 
00:37:41.190 --> 00:37:41.200 align:start position:0%
discriminatory injustice topics from
 
00:37:43.910 --> 00:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
other nations are being taught just not
 
00:37:47.109 --> 00:37:47.119 align:start position:0%
intentionally being forced into a unit
 
00:37:50.950 --> 00:37:50.960 align:start position:0%
to be taught about american civil rights
 
00:37:53.030 --> 00:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
i want us to think about why we would do
 
00:37:54.550 --> 00:37:54.560 align:start position:0%
such a thing
 
00:37:57.349 --> 00:37:57.359 align:start position:0%
why are we so seeking to show the faults
 
00:37:59.349 --> 00:37:59.359 align:start position:0%
of others when learning about our own
 
00:38:01.270 --> 00:38:01.280 align:start position:0%
faults in the history of the united
 
00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:02.470 align:start position:0%
faults in the history of the united
states

00:38:02.470 --> 00:38:02.480 align:start position:0%
states
 
00:38:04.790 --> 00:38:04.800 align:start position:0%
why do we have a need to maintain this
 
00:38:07.430 --> 00:38:07.440 align:start position:0%
image of a perfect america
 
00:38:09.349 --> 00:38:09.359 align:start position:0%
i think it's because we somehow are
 
00:38:11.750 --> 00:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
convinced ourselves that if there were
 
00:38:14.550 --> 00:38:14.560 align:start position:0%
serious wrongs and if there are serious
 
00:38:16.950 --> 00:38:16.960 align:start position:0%
wrongs that people will not be able to
 
00:38:19.510 --> 00:38:19.520 align:start position:0%
love america or worse that they might
 
00:38:20.870 --> 00:38:20.880 align:start position:0%
hate it
 
00:38:24.230 --> 00:38:24.240 align:start position:0%
i challenge us to rethink this reasoning
 
00:38:25.829 --> 00:38:25.839 align:start position:0%
and to understand
 
00:38:28.870 --> 00:38:28.880 align:start position:0%
by teaching real history without tactics
 
00:38:31.510 --> 00:38:31.520 align:start position:0%
to downplay the reality of our mistakes
 
00:38:33.750 --> 00:38:33.760 align:start position:0%
allows students to see a world where
 
00:38:36.710 --> 00:38:36.720 align:start position:0%
mistakes do happen and can be fixed
 
00:38:39.589 --> 00:38:39.599 align:start position:0%
we cannot get to amer a more fairer
 
00:38:41.990 --> 00:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
world without understanding history and
 
00:38:44.630 --> 00:38:44.640 align:start position:0%
how we got to where we are today
 
00:38:48.230 --> 00:38:48.240 align:start position:0%
h hb 1632 will absolve ourselves of
 
00:38:50.550 --> 00:38:50.560 align:start position:0%
having to reckon with our own past by
 
00:38:52.550 --> 00:38:52.560 align:start position:0%
comparing the united states human rights
 
00:38:54.950 --> 00:38:54.960 align:start position:0%
atrocities to the human rights horrors
 
00:38:56.950 --> 00:38:56.960 align:start position:0%
that have happened in other countries
 
00:38:59.030 --> 00:38:59.040 align:start position:0%
with different governments and different
 
00:39:01.910 --> 00:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
time periods one has nothing to do with
 
00:39:02.870 --> 00:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
the other
 
00:39:04.870 --> 00:39:04.880 align:start position:0%
because of all these reasons i asked the
 
00:39:07.630 --> 00:39:07.640 align:start position:0%

today uh my name is frank knack and
 
00:40:02.310 --> 00:40:02.320 align:start position:0%
policy director
 
00:40:04.710 --> 00:40:04.720 align:start position:0%
with the aclu of new hampshire and we
 
00:40:06.630 --> 00:40:06.640 align:start position:0%
are here in opposition uh to this
 
00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:07.829 align:start position:0%
are here in opposition uh to this
legislation

00:40:07.829 --> 00:40:07.839 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:40:09.510 --> 00:40:09.520 align:start position:0%
uh you know many many of the important
 
00:40:10.790 --> 00:40:10.800 align:start position:0%
points that i wanted to raise have
 
00:40:12.230 --> 00:40:12.240 align:start position:0%
already been raised so i don't want to
 
00:40:14.069 --> 00:40:14.079 align:start position:0%
um repeat repeat what's already been
 
00:40:16.390 --> 00:40:16.400 align:start position:0%
said uh very well
 
00:40:18.150 --> 00:40:18.160 align:start position:0%
i think just to kind of sum this up
 
00:40:19.750 --> 00:40:19.760 align:start position:0%
there's two things that we are concerned
 
00:40:22.470 --> 00:40:22.480 align:start position:0%
about with this bill that i think
 
00:40:24.309 --> 00:40:24.319 align:start position:0%
regardless of the intent how it could be
 
00:40:27.670 --> 00:40:27.680 align:start position:0%
actualized or concerning one is as has
 
00:40:29.589 --> 00:40:29.599 align:start position:0%
been mentioned it downplays our unique
 
00:40:32.230 --> 00:40:32.240 align:start position:0%
history i think it was well covered the
 
00:40:34.150 --> 00:40:34.160 align:start position:0%
the things the context that's necessary
 
00:40:35.750 --> 00:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
to understand how we got to the civil
 
00:40:38.630 --> 00:40:38.640 align:start position:0%
rights movement in the 50s and 60s
 
00:40:41.270 --> 00:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
from you know slavery to convict leasing
 
00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:42.790 align:start position:0%
from you know slavery to convict leasing
tulsa

00:40:42.790 --> 00:40:42.800 align:start position:0%
tulsa
 
00:40:44.710 --> 00:40:44.720 align:start position:0%
racial terror etc
 
00:40:46.630 --> 00:40:46.640 align:start position:0%
i think what hadn't been noted too is
 
00:40:48.150 --> 00:40:48.160 align:start position:0%
this notion that
 
00:40:50.710 --> 00:40:50.720 align:start position:0%
everything has been fined since 68 which
 
00:40:53.430 --> 00:40:53.440 align:start position:0%
this legislation if implemented could
 
00:40:55.190 --> 00:40:55.200 align:start position:0%
could lead towards and i think that
 
00:40:56.630 --> 00:40:56.640 align:start position:0%
would undermine you know at the most
 
00:40:58.630 --> 00:40:58.640 align:start position:0%
foundational level the war on drugs you
 
00:41:00.950 --> 00:41:00.960 align:start position:0%
have john ehrlich man who was nixon's
 
00:41:02.870 --> 00:41:02.880 align:start position:0%
domestic policy advisor
 
00:41:04.390 --> 00:41:04.400 align:start position:0%
who oversaw the implementation of the
 
00:41:06.470 --> 00:41:06.480 align:start position:0%
war on drugs on record saying the war on
 
00:41:08.550 --> 00:41:08.560 align:start position:0%
drugs was to quote control the black
 
00:41:10.150 --> 00:41:10.160 align:start position:0%
community and control the anti-war
 
00:41:12.630 --> 00:41:12.640 align:start position:0%
movement that context is necessary and i
 
00:41:13.990 --> 00:41:14.000 align:start position:0%
think it leads to where we are today
 
00:41:15.430 --> 00:41:15.440 align:start position:0%
where we have a mass incarceration
 
00:41:17.349 --> 00:41:17.359 align:start position:0%
crisis in this country and where black
 
00:41:19.349 --> 00:41:19.359 align:start position:0%
people are disproportionately
 
00:41:21.190 --> 00:41:21.200 align:start position:0%
incarcerated at all levels including
 
00:41:22.870 --> 00:41:22.880 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire
 
00:41:24.950 --> 00:41:24.960 align:start position:0%
new for example in new hampshire right
 
00:41:26.870 --> 00:41:26.880 align:start position:0%
now we know that black people and white
 
00:41:28.710 --> 00:41:28.720 align:start position:0%
people use marijuana at roughly the same
 
00:41:31.430 --> 00:41:31.440 align:start position:0%
rate yet black people are 4.1 times more
 
00:41:32.870 --> 00:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
likely to be arrested for marijuana
 
00:41:34.790 --> 00:41:34.800 align:start position:0%
possession than white people
 
00:41:36.790 --> 00:41:36.800 align:start position:0%
how did we get here that history that
 
00:41:39.109 --> 00:41:39.119 align:start position:0%
context is important i think it's also
 
00:41:40.950 --> 00:41:40.960 align:start position:0%
important to recognize the extreme
 
00:41:42.470 --> 00:41:42.480 align:start position:0%
racial wealth divide we have in this
 
00:41:44.069 --> 00:41:44.079 align:start position:0%
country where black the average black
 
00:41:47.109 --> 00:41:47.119 align:start position:0%
family has 17 000 in wealth the average
 
00:41:49.349 --> 00:41:49.359 align:start position:0%
white family has a hundred and seventy
 
00:41:51.349 --> 00:41:51.359 align:start position:0%
one thousand dollars in wealth a ten
 
00:41:53.349 --> 00:41:53.359 align:start position:0%
times increase over the average black
 
00:41:55.670 --> 00:41:55.680 align:start position:0%
family and how did we get there and it's
 
00:41:57.589 --> 00:41:57.599 align:start position:0%
the laws and policies that have been in
 
00:41:59.510 --> 00:41:59.520 align:start position:0%
place at our country since the beginning
 
00:42:01.829 --> 00:42:01.839 align:start position:0%
that led us here from you know having
 
00:42:04.069 --> 00:42:04.079 align:start position:0%
laws and policies to protected the slave
 
00:42:06.630 --> 00:42:06.640 align:start position:0%
owner against the abolitionist laws and
 
00:42:09.030 --> 00:42:09.040 align:start position:0%
policies that allowed for convict
 
00:42:11.270 --> 00:42:11.280 align:start position:0%
leasing to go after slavery was quote
 
00:42:13.750 --> 00:42:13.760 align:start position:0%
unquote abolished after the civil war
 
00:42:16.309 --> 00:42:16.319 align:start position:0%
laws and policies that protected the jim
 
00:42:18.150 --> 00:42:18.160 align:start position:0%
crow segregationists over the civil
 
00:42:20.710 --> 00:42:20.720 align:start position:0%
rights protesters laws and policies that
 
00:42:23.510 --> 00:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
continue to protect police violence over
 
00:42:25.670 --> 00:42:25.680 align:start position:0%
those who are trying to stop it i think
 
00:42:27.270 --> 00:42:27.280 align:start position:0%
it's important that students in our
 
00:42:29.109 --> 00:42:29.119 align:start position:0%
state understand that history understand
 
00:42:31.430 --> 00:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
the context and legislation like this
 
00:42:32.950 --> 00:42:32.960 align:start position:0%
will bring us in the wrong direction so
 
00:42:34.309 --> 00:42:34.319 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for the opportunity to
 
00:42:34.319 --> 00:42:35.990 align:start position:0%

00:42:50.230 --> 00:42:50.240 align:start position:0%
so with that
 
00:42:59.270 --> 00:42:59.280 align:start position:0%

see what time is it
 
00:43:09.190 --> 00:43:09.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:11.270 --> 00:43:11.280 align:start position:0%
we have about three minutes before we
 
00:43:30.630 --> 00:43:30.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:31.670 align:start position:0%

okay
 
00:43:53.349 --> 00:43:53.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:07.349 --> 00:44:07.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:07.359 --> 00:44:08.550 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:44:08.550 --> 00:44:08.560 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:44:50.150 --> 00:44:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:51.990 --> 00:44:52.000 align:start position:0%
once again for committee members if you
 
00:44:53.349 --> 00:44:53.359 align:start position:0%
have a bill you have to testify in
 
00:44:55.510 --> 00:44:55.520 align:start position:0%
another committee just please you know
 
00:44:57.190 --> 00:44:57.200 align:start position:0%
go to that and then come back following
 
00:44:57.200 --> 00:45:26.870 align:start position:0%
go to that and then come back following
that

00:45:26.870 --> 00:45:26.880 align:start position:0%

this time with hb
 
00:45:35.270 --> 00:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
1190 1190 this is relative to rule
 
00:45:37.030 --> 00:45:37.040 align:start position:0%
making by the state board of education
 
00:45:40.069 --> 00:45:40.079 align:start position:0%
for compliance with federal provisions
 
00:45:42.710 --> 00:45:42.720 align:start position:0%
so with that uh a welcome to the
 
00:45:46.950 --> 00:45:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:49.030 --> 00:45:49.040 align:start position:0%
excuse me thank you mr chair and thank
 
00:45:51.349 --> 00:45:51.359 align:start position:0%
you honorable committee members
 
00:45:53.990 --> 00:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
uh for listening to my testimony today
 
00:45:56.790 --> 00:45:56.800 align:start position:0%
uh i was uh brought the idea for this
 
00:45:59.670 --> 00:45:59.680 align:start position:0%
bill from a fellow representative so i
 
00:46:02.150 --> 00:46:02.160 align:start position:0%
hope i do it justice and this is my
 
00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:03.270 align:start position:0%
hope i do it justice and this is my
first

00:46:03.270 --> 00:46:03.280 align:start position:0%

00:46:07.829 --> 00:46:07.839 align:start position:0%

00:46:10.309 --> 00:46:10.319 align:start position:0%
inner rep litchfield and ask for
 
00:46:12.309 --> 00:46:12.319 align:start position:0%

00:46:15.190 --> 00:46:15.200 align:start position:0%
as we go forward um
 
00:46:18.270 --> 00:46:18.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for allowing me to present
 
00:46:20.630 --> 00:46:20.640 align:start position:0%
hb11190 to you today
 
00:46:22.470 --> 00:46:22.480 align:start position:0%
one of the many great discoveries i have
 
00:46:24.550 --> 00:46:24.560 align:start position:0%
made as a legislator and former school
 
00:46:27.510 --> 00:46:27.520 align:start position:0%
board member is how grant money works
 
00:46:29.430 --> 00:46:29.440 align:start position:0%
when the money is received it's exciting
 
00:46:31.589 --> 00:46:31.599 align:start position:0%
to think of the opportunities this gift
 
00:46:32.950 --> 00:46:32.960 align:start position:0%
can create
 
00:46:34.950 --> 00:46:34.960 align:start position:0%
as a legislator i'm also learning about
 
00:46:36.710 --> 00:46:36.720 align:start position:0%
the rules and framework of that grant
 
00:46:38.870 --> 00:46:38.880 align:start position:0%
money and just how much work needs to be
 
00:46:41.510 --> 00:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
done before the grant is accepted here's
 
00:46:42.950 --> 00:46:42.960 align:start position:0%
an example
 
00:46:44.870 --> 00:46:44.880 align:start position:0%
uh on tuesday our committee held a
 
00:46:49.270 --> 00:46:49.280 align:start position:0%
hearing for hb 154 f-n-l
 
00:46:51.190 --> 00:46:51.200 align:start position:0%
requiring school districts to provide
 
00:46:52.790 --> 00:46:52.800 align:start position:0%
breakfast for students
 
00:46:55.030 --> 00:46:55.040 align:start position:0%
like the great mr frew i don't know if
 
00:46:56.150 --> 00:46:56.160 align:start position:0%
he's here or not from the
 
00:46:58.550 --> 00:46:58.560 align:start position:0%
superintendent's association said to be
 
00:47:00.069 --> 00:47:00.079 align:start position:0%
against a bill like this would be to
 
00:47:02.470 --> 00:47:02.480 align:start position:0%
disagree with puppies and apple pie or
 
00:47:04.069 --> 00:47:04.079 align:start position:0%
something like that
 
00:47:05.829 --> 00:47:05.839 align:start position:0%
i know as legislators we would love to
 
00:47:07.589 --> 00:47:07.599 align:start position:0%
be able to to cover the cost of
 
00:47:10.150 --> 00:47:10.160 align:start position:0%
breakfast for all students every day but
 
00:47:12.950 --> 00:47:12.960 align:start position:0%
this but often well-intentioned money is
 
00:47:15.349 --> 00:47:15.359 align:start position:0%
short-sighted while attempting to do
 
00:47:16.870 --> 00:47:16.880 align:start position:0%
something positive we don't look at the
 
00:47:19.430 --> 00:47:19.440 align:start position:0%
long-term impacts of a program
 
00:47:21.990 --> 00:47:22.000 align:start position:0%
what if the program expands how do we
 
00:47:24.230 --> 00:47:24.240 align:start position:0%
cover the cost for a successful program
 
00:47:25.750 --> 00:47:25.760 align:start position:0%
in the years to come
 
00:47:28.069 --> 00:47:28.079 align:start position:0%
who will oversee the program and are
 
00:47:29.990 --> 00:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
there additional costs associated with
 
00:47:31.829 --> 00:47:31.839 align:start position:0%
program startup
 
00:47:34.390 --> 00:47:34.400 align:start position:0%
grant programs that offer full or near
 
00:47:37.190 --> 00:47:37.200 align:start position:0%
full funding support at startup but in
 
00:47:38.790 --> 00:47:38.800 align:start position:0%
subsequent years when the federally
 
00:47:41.270 --> 00:47:41.280 align:start position:0%
mandated funded program is reduced by
 
00:47:43.190 --> 00:47:43.200 align:start position:0%
half or more
 
00:47:45.910 --> 00:47:45.920 align:start position:0%
local boards are left with few options
 
00:47:48.549 --> 00:47:48.559 align:start position:0%
boards can either make difficult k-12
 
00:47:50.950 --> 00:47:50.960 align:start position:0%
programming reductions that harm all

00:47:55.670 --> 00:47:55.680 align:start position:0%

00:47:57.510 --> 00:47:57.520 align:start position:0%

community
 
00:48:04.069 --> 00:48:04.079 align:start position:0%
this situation is especially true with
 
00:48:06.710 --> 00:48:06.720 align:start position:0%
special education costs for example in
 
00:48:08.870 --> 00:48:08.880 align:start position:0%
california the annual cost of educating
 
00:48:11.270 --> 00:48:11.280 align:start position:0%
a student with disabilities averages
 
00:48:13.589 --> 00:48:13.599 align:start position:0%
about twenty seven thousand per student
 
00:48:15.750 --> 00:48:15.760 align:start position:0%
compared with general education costs at
 
00:48:18.390 --> 00:48:18.400 align:start position:0%
about ten thousand per student in recent
 
00:48:19.670 --> 00:48:19.680 align:start position:0%
years the funding from federal
 
00:48:22.309 --> 00:48:22.319 align:start position:0%
government is below 15 of the average
 
00:48:24.630 --> 00:48:24.640 align:start position:0%
per pupil expenditure
 
00:48:26.309 --> 00:48:26.319 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire state and local
 
00:48:27.990 --> 00:48:28.000 align:start position:0%
appropriations have picked up that
 
00:48:30.950 --> 00:48:30.960 align:start position:0%
difference along with all costs above
 
00:48:33.030 --> 00:48:33.040 align:start position:0%
the 40 percent promised by the federal
 
00:48:33.040 --> 00:48:34.630 align:start position:0%
the 40 percent promised by the federal
government

00:48:34.630 --> 00:48:34.640 align:start position:0%
government
 
00:48:36.349 --> 00:48:36.359 align:start position:0%
should this measure
 
00:48:38.470 --> 00:48:38.480 align:start position:0%
hb1190 pass
 
00:48:40.790 --> 00:48:40.800 align:start position:0%
any mandated curriculum or program of
 
00:48:42.710 --> 00:48:42.720 align:start position:0%
study by federal or state must be
 
00:48:45.270 --> 00:48:45.280 align:start position:0%
accompanied with an adequate fiscal note
 
00:48:45.280 --> 00:48:46.069 align:start position:0%
accompanied with an adequate fiscal note
to

00:48:46.069 --> 00:48:46.079 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:48:48.950 --> 00:48:48.960 align:start position:0%
sustain local costs for implementation
 
00:48:51.910 --> 00:48:51.920 align:start position:0%
imper improper funding of state mandates
 
00:48:53.430 --> 00:48:53.440 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire violates our new

hampshire constitution
 
00:48:56.950 --> 00:48:56.960 align:start position:0%
under part first
 
00:48:59.430 --> 00:48:59.440 align:start position:0%
bill of rights article 28a
 
00:49:01.510 --> 00:49:01.520 align:start position:0%
i think about these programs becoming
 
00:49:04.710 --> 00:49:04.720 align:start position:0%
local taxpayer responsibilities with
 
00:49:07.030 --> 00:49:07.040 align:start position:0%
only a rising tax bill to let them know
 
00:49:09.430 --> 00:49:09.440 align:start position:0%
the program even exists
 
00:49:11.349 --> 00:49:11.359 align:start position:0%
i think we can and should do better for
 
00:49:13.829 --> 00:49:13.839 align:start position:0%
our constituents let's hold the federal
 
00:49:15.829 --> 00:49:15.839 align:start position:0%
government to the state same standards
 
00:49:17.670 --> 00:49:17.680 align:start position:0%
to which we hold ourselves
 
00:49:19.750 --> 00:49:19.760 align:start position:0%
this measure does not oppose the federal
 
00:49:21.750 --> 00:49:21.760 align:start position:0%
government but does tell the state board
 
00:49:23.990 --> 00:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
that they cannot create rules where
 
00:49:26.230 --> 00:49:26.240 align:start position:0%
there is a lack of federal funding
 
00:49:28.069 --> 00:49:28.079 align:start position:0%
similar bills have been heard in the
 
00:49:29.750 --> 00:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
education committee and this committee
 
00:49:31.430 --> 00:49:31.440 align:start position:0%
has also voted down
 
00:49:31.440 --> 00:49:32.309 align:start position:0%
has also voted down
federal

00:49:32.309 --> 00:49:32.319 align:start position:0%
federal
 
00:49:34.710 --> 00:49:34.720 align:start position:0%
federal regulation that could not be
 
00:49:36.069 --> 00:49:36.079 align:start position:0%
fully funded
 
00:49:39.190 --> 00:49:39.200 align:start position:0%
so i welcome your feedback and comments
 
00:49:40.470 --> 00:49:40.480 align:start position:0%
and let's
 
00:49:43.109 --> 00:49:43.119 align:start position:0%
make this a bipartisan effort thank you
 
00:49:44.710 --> 00:49:44.720 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative are
 
00:49:47.109 --> 00:49:47.119 align:start position:0%
there questions from the committee
 
00:49:49.349 --> 00:49:49.359 align:start position:0%
representative tanner
 
00:49:51.750 --> 00:49:51.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you and you did
 
00:49:54.230 --> 00:49:54.240 align:start position:0%
a great job for the presentation so
 
00:49:57.349 --> 00:49:57.359 align:start position:0%
thank you and and i fully support the
 
00:49:58.950 --> 00:49:58.960 align:start position:0%
idea that
 
00:49:58.960 --> 00:49:59.910 align:start position:0%
idea that
whatever

00:49:59.910 --> 00:49:59.920 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
00:50:02.390 --> 00:50:02.400 align:start position:0%
happens whatever we do
 
00:50:04.870 --> 00:50:04.880 align:start position:0%
should we should take into consideration
 
00:50:06.710 --> 00:50:06.720 align:start position:0%
long-term impact
 
00:50:09.430 --> 00:50:09.440 align:start position:0%
how to cover costs
 
00:50:11.589 --> 00:50:11.599 align:start position:0%
how it's going to be overseen and the
 
00:50:16.069 --> 00:50:16.079 align:start position:0%
cost was start-up and i think we need
 
00:50:16.079 --> 00:50:17.270 align:start position:0%
cost was start-up and i think we need
really

00:50:17.270 --> 00:50:17.280 align:start position:0%
really
 
00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:18.470 align:start position:0%
really
competent

00:50:18.470 --> 00:50:18.480 align:start position:0%
competent
 
00:50:21.670 --> 00:50:21.680 align:start position:0%
and accurate fiscal notes
 
00:50:23.030 --> 00:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
i'm talking
 
00:50:26.069 --> 00:50:26.079 align:start position:0%
and the federal government has has left
 
00:50:28.470 --> 00:50:28.480 align:start position:0%
us short several times okay
 
00:50:30.390 --> 00:50:30.400 align:start position:0%
i totally agree with that
 
00:50:33.190 --> 00:50:33.200 align:start position:0%
however i was wondering how you think
 
00:50:35.829 --> 00:50:35.839 align:start position:0%
this applies to the state
 
00:50:38.790 --> 00:50:38.800 align:start position:0%
we have a voucher program that we got
 
00:50:42.950 --> 00:50:42.960 align:start position:0%
with 129 000 physical note which was now
 
00:50:45.109 --> 00:50:45.119 align:start position:0%
over 68 million dollars
 
00:50:46.950 --> 00:50:46.960 align:start position:0%
so that's
 
00:50:49.430 --> 00:50:49.440 align:start position:0%
a big thing there was no oversight
 
00:50:51.510 --> 00:50:51.520 align:start position:0%
really um
 
00:50:54.069 --> 00:50:54.079 align:start position:0%
on how that money was being spent or how
 
00:50:55.990 --> 00:50:56.000 align:start position:0%
it was being accounted for
 
00:50:58.950 --> 00:50:58.960 align:start position:0%
um no way really
 
00:51:01.270 --> 00:51:01.280 align:start position:0%
no cost for startups we heard from the
 
00:51:03.750 --> 00:51:03.760 align:start position:0%
department of education yesterday that
 
00:51:03.760 --> 00:51:05.349 align:start position:0%
department of education yesterday that
um

00:51:05.349 --> 00:51:05.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:08.069 --> 00:51:08.079 align:start position:0%
you know it they need a administrator at
 
00:51:10.549 --> 00:51:10.559 align:start position:0%
doe because they didn't realize how much
 
00:51:13.030 --> 00:51:13.040 align:start position:0%
it was going to cost for the startup
 
00:51:13.040 --> 00:51:13.829 align:start position:0%
it was going to cost for the startup
so

00:51:13.829 --> 00:51:13.839 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:51:16.230 --> 00:51:16.240 align:start position:0%
i guess what i would like to see and
 
00:51:18.069 --> 00:51:18.079 align:start position:0%
whether you would be amenable to it or
 
00:51:18.079 --> 00:51:18.870 align:start position:0%
whether you would be amenable to it or
not

00:51:18.870 --> 00:51:18.880 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:51:18.880 --> 00:51:20.549 align:start position:0%
not
that

00:51:20.549 --> 00:51:20.559 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:51:22.790 --> 00:51:22.800 align:start position:0%
we actually outline
 
00:51:24.950 --> 00:51:24.960 align:start position:0%
those statements that you made
 
00:51:27.990 --> 00:51:28.000 align:start position:0%
and make it available or applicable to
 
00:51:31.349 --> 00:51:31.359 align:start position:0%
both federal and our state government
 
00:51:33.990 --> 00:51:34.000 align:start position:0%
would you would you agree that
 
00:51:35.510 --> 00:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
perhaps that would be a good amendment
 
00:51:37.910 --> 00:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
for this bill
 
00:51:40.069 --> 00:51:40.079 align:start position:0%
um i i would be open to a discussion
 
00:51:41.829 --> 00:51:41.839 align:start position:0%
about that for sure
 
00:51:44.549 --> 00:51:44.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:47.990 --> 00:51:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:50.390 --> 00:51:50.400 align:start position:0%
not seeing any thank you very much
 
00:51:51.829 --> 00:51:51.839 align:start position:0%
thank you everyone
 
00:51:57.030 --> 00:51:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:59.349 --> 00:51:59.359 align:start position:0%
okay i do not on that one have any other
 
00:52:01.750 --> 00:52:01.760 align:start position:0%
pink cards
 
00:52:03.349 --> 00:52:03.359 align:start position:0%
so with that we're going to close this
 
00:52:03.359 --> 00:52:06.150 align:start position:0%
so with that we're going to close this
hearing

00:52:06.150 --> 00:52:06.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:08.309 --> 00:52:08.319 align:start position:0%
and you have an opportunity to
 
00:52:10.549 --> 00:52:10.559 align:start position:0%
walk around stretch and
 
00:52:12.710 --> 00:52:12.720 align:start position:0%
maybe get a little brunch or whatever
 
00:52:16.230 --> 00:52:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:18.950 --> 00:52:18.960 align:start position:0%
so the next one we have
 
00:52:20.790 --> 00:52:20.800 align:start position:0%
starts up at
 
00:52:23.589 --> 00:52:23.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:26.470 --> 00:52:26.480 align:start position:0%
10 30 excuse 10 30 no wait a minute or
 
00:52:26.480 --> 00:52:27.190 align:start position:0%
10 30 excuse 10 30 no wait a minute or
not

00:52:27.190 --> 00:52:27.200 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:52:30.390 --> 00:52:30.400 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at election loss excuse me
 
00:52:32.870 --> 00:52:32.880 align:start position:0%
i've done that several times here 10 30
 
00:52:34.390 --> 00:52:34.400 align:start position:0%
when the next bill starts that will be
 
00:52:36.870 --> 00:52:36.880 align:start position:0%
13 11 when we start in approximately a
 
00:52:38.790 --> 00:52:38.800 align:start position:0%
little over 35 minutes
 
00:52:40.309 --> 00:52:40.319 align:start position:0%
35 40 minutes
 
00:52:43.750 --> 00:52:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:29.430 --> 00:53:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:29.440 --> 00:53:56.150 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:53:56.150 --> 00:53:56.160 align:start position:0%

consequences for an individual's actions

01:43:00.310 --> 01:43:00.320 align:start position:0%
introducing this uh legislation
 
01:43:02.310 --> 01:43:02.320 align:start position:0%
one of the things that you mentioned um
 
01:43:04.390 --> 01:43:04.400 align:start position:0%
um well a lot of it piqued my interest
 
01:43:06.310 --> 01:43:06.320 align:start position:0%
but uh but one of the things you talked
 
01:43:09.590 --> 01:43:09.600 align:start position:0%
about was the um the interest in uh in
 
01:43:11.189 --> 01:43:11.199 align:start position:0%
attaining a new hampshire teacher
 
01:43:13.270 --> 01:43:13.280 align:start position:0%
certification and using it in other
 
01:43:13.280 --> 01:43:14.310 align:start position:0%
certification and using it in other
states

01:43:14.310 --> 01:43:14.320 align:start position:0%
states
 
01:43:15.669 --> 01:43:15.679 align:start position:0%
and i was wondering if you could sort of
 
01:43:18.550 --> 01:43:18.560 align:start position:0%
expand on that a little bit more and and
 
01:43:20.709 --> 01:43:20.719 align:start position:0%
how this applies
 
01:43:23.910 --> 01:43:23.920 align:start position:0%
or how this does or doesn't apply to to
 
01:43:26.310 --> 01:43:26.320 align:start position:0%
the certification process uh well you
 
01:43:29.109 --> 01:43:29.119 align:start position:0%
know the intricacies of licensing in new
 
01:43:31.750 --> 01:43:31.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire uh representative luna
 
01:43:34.470 --> 01:43:34.480 align:start position:0%
that that information came to attention
 
01:43:36.229 --> 01:43:36.239 align:start position:0%
came to our attention last year when we
 
01:43:38.790 --> 01:43:38.800 align:start position:0%
were discussing human trafficking
 
01:43:41.350 --> 01:43:41.360 align:start position:0%
and it was attorney fenton who obviously
 
01:43:43.590 --> 01:43:43.600 align:start position:0%
raised the concern
 
01:43:45.590 --> 01:43:45.600 align:start position:0%
in the next hearing that we have we'll
 
01:43:48.229 --> 01:43:48.239 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit about senate bill 134
 
01:43:51.270 --> 01:43:51.280 align:start position:0%
which last year added uh the section
 
01:43:54.709 --> 01:43:54.719 align:start position:0%
five offenses to credentialing in the
 
01:43:56.310 --> 01:43:56.320 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire
 
01:43:59.990 --> 01:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
so anything that is added to the section
 
01:44:01.590 --> 01:44:01.600 align:start position:0%
five list
 
01:44:03.189 --> 01:44:03.199 align:start position:0%
with regards to
 
01:44:05.669 --> 01:44:05.679 align:start position:0%
generic employment
 
01:44:08.070 --> 01:44:08.080 align:start position:0%
will ultimately end up on the list of
 
01:44:09.990 --> 01:44:10.000 align:start position:0%
section five offenses that prevent
 
01:44:12.470 --> 01:44:12.480 align:start position:0%
credentialing as well
 
01:44:13.669 --> 01:44:13.679 align:start position:0%
are there further questions of
 
01:44:15.109 --> 01:44:15.119 align:start position:0%

thank you for taking my question uh what
 
01:44:21.350 --> 01:44:21.360 align:start position:0%
happens to what would anyone fall into
 
01:44:24.629 --> 01:44:24.639 align:start position:0%
the category of this new offense that's
 
01:44:26.470 --> 01:44:26.480 align:start position:0%
currently employed
 
01:44:27.990 --> 01:44:28.000 align:start position:0%
here and
 
01:44:30.550 --> 01:44:30.560 align:start position:0%

01:44:33.590 --> 01:44:33.600 align:start position:0%
that may be yes but i will uh ask you

01:44:55.270 --> 01:44:55.280 align:start position:0%
you don't want us to comment on that
 
01:44:55.280 --> 01:44:56.550 align:start position:0%
you don't want us to comment on that
uh

01:44:56.550 --> 01:44:56.560 align:start position:0%

limit on quantity or on
 
01:45:26.790 --> 01:45:26.800 align:start position:0%
statute of limitations
 
01:45:29.669 --> 01:45:29.679 align:start position:0%
just thinking like you said
 
01:45:31.669 --> 01:45:31.679 align:start position:0%
you're stupid you're in school you're
 
01:45:33.830 --> 01:45:33.840 align:start position:0%
not planning on selling or distributing
 
01:45:36.149 --> 01:45:36.159 align:start position:0%
but you got five friends who said hey
 
01:45:37.830 --> 01:45:37.840 align:start position:0%
while you're there can you pick me up
 
01:45:40.550 --> 01:45:40.560 align:start position:0%
whatever and so all you you you've
 
01:45:42.950 --> 01:45:42.960 align:start position:0%
brought it back and and and they
 
01:45:44.390 --> 01:45:44.400 align:start position:0%
reimbursed you
 
01:45:46.149 --> 01:45:46.159 align:start position:0%
for your expense
 
01:45:48.870 --> 01:45:48.880 align:start position:0%
um not saying anybody should do that but
 
01:45:50.709 --> 01:45:50.719 align:start position:0%
i'm just saying
 
01:45:53.270 --> 01:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
you know 10 years 15 years down the road
 
01:45:55.189 --> 01:45:55.199 align:start position:0%
is that going and they decide oh they
 
01:45:57.270 --> 01:45:57.280 align:start position:0%
have a real gift for teaching
 
01:46:00.470 --> 01:46:00.480 align:start position:0%
i know that there is a time table for
 
01:46:03.350 --> 01:46:03.360 align:start position:0%
expunging somebody's record
 
01:46:05.590 --> 01:46:05.600 align:start position:0%
but again i'll let attorney fenton speak
 
01:46:07.189 --> 01:46:07.199 align:start position:0%
to that representative lakers so that i
 
01:46:09.270 --> 01:46:09.280 align:start position:0%
don't give you misinformation thank you
 
01:46:10.950 --> 01:46:10.960 align:start position:0%
you're welcome thank you very much
 
01:46:17.350 --> 01:46:17.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:22.709 --> 01:46:22.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:23.990 --> 01:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:25.270 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

01:46:25.270 --> 01:46:25.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:27.510 --> 01:46:27.520 align:start position:0%
the distinction between employment and
 
01:46:29.669 --> 01:46:29.679 align:start position:0%
credentialing is there something in here
 
01:46:29.679 --> 01:46:30.470 align:start position:0%
credentialing is there something in here
that

01:46:30.470 --> 01:46:30.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:46:32.709 --> 01:46:32.719 align:start position:0%
that i don't know about or just i'm
 
01:46:35.510 --> 01:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
unaware of yeah employment refers to
 
01:46:37.590 --> 01:46:37.600 align:start position:0%
anybody that works for a school district
 
01:46:39.990 --> 01:46:40.000 align:start position:0%
so the credentialing is only uh only
 
01:46:43.590 --> 01:46:43.600 align:start position:0%
applies to teachers and administrators
 
01:46:45.510 --> 01:46:45.520 align:start position:0%
would this affect their credentialing
 
01:46:47.270 --> 01:46:47.280 align:start position:0%
could someone lose their teaching
 
01:46:47.280 --> 01:46:49.510 align:start position:0%
could someone lose their teaching
certificate

01:46:49.510 --> 01:46:49.520 align:start position:0%
certificate
 
01:46:51.910 --> 01:46:51.920 align:start position:0%
through a process like that perhaps uh
 
01:46:54.390 --> 01:46:54.400 align:start position:0%
that can be answered by the yeah i think
 
01:46:56.229 --> 01:46:56.239 align:start position:0%
we'll let uh we'll let attorney fenton
 
01:46:59.030 --> 01:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
take that as well okay
 
01:47:00.470 --> 01:47:00.480 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative
 
01:47:00.480 --> 01:47:07.430 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative

welcome

01:47:11.990 --> 01:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:13.830 --> 01:47:13.840 align:start position:0%
good morning for the record my name is
 
01:47:15.350 --> 01:47:15.360 align:start position:0%
diana fenton i'm an attorney with the
 
01:47:17.590 --> 01:47:17.600 align:start position:0%
department of education um thank you for
 
01:47:19.510 --> 01:47:19.520 align:start position:0%
having us today and thank you
 
01:47:21.030 --> 01:47:21.040 align:start position:0%
representative mullen for bringing this
 
01:47:22.790 --> 01:47:22.800 align:start position:0%
bill forward this
 
01:47:24.950 --> 01:47:24.960 align:start position:0%
does continue the department's
 
01:47:26.870 --> 01:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
initiatives in child safety so
 
01:47:28.629 --> 01:47:28.639 align:start position:0%
commissioner edelblut thanks you for
 
01:47:30.470 --> 01:47:30.480 align:start position:0%
your attention to this bill this is a
 
01:47:32.070 --> 01:47:32.080 align:start position:0%
bill that he and i have worked on and
 
01:47:34.470 --> 01:47:34.480 align:start position:0%
discussed quite a bit
 
01:47:36.310 --> 01:47:36.320 align:start position:0%
i want to address some of the questions
 
01:47:39.189 --> 01:47:39.199 align:start position:0%
that have come up regarding employment
 
01:47:41.350 --> 01:47:41.360 align:start position:0%
versus licensure
 
01:47:45.910 --> 01:47:45.920 align:start position:0%
rsa 189 13 a deals exclusively with
 
01:47:45.920 --> 01:47:49.990 align:start position:0%
rsa 189 13 a deals exclusively with
employment

01:47:49.990 --> 01:47:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:53.350 --> 01:47:53.360 align:start position:0%
prior to last year's legislative session
 
01:47:55.430 --> 01:47:55.440 align:start position:0%
when the department issued a credential
 
01:47:57.430 --> 01:47:57.440 align:start position:0%
to someone to teach
 
01:48:00.629 --> 01:48:00.639 align:start position:0%
they did not do any kind of criminal
 
01:48:03.510 --> 01:48:03.520 align:start position:0%
history background check
 
01:48:06.790 --> 01:48:06.800 align:start position:0%
the background check was exclusive to
 
01:48:10.070 --> 01:48:10.080 align:start position:0%
the area the realm of employment only
 
01:48:13.189 --> 01:48:13.199 align:start position:0%
so what we recognized at the department
 
01:48:15.830 --> 01:48:15.840 align:start position:0%
was a couple of items of concern
 
01:48:18.070 --> 01:48:18.080 align:start position:0%
the first is the department was in the
 
01:48:20.870 --> 01:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
position where a state agency was
 
01:48:23.030 --> 01:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
issuing a license to someone to be
 
01:48:25.109 --> 01:48:25.119 align:start position:0%
around children to teach
 
01:48:26.709 --> 01:48:26.719 align:start position:0%
without doing that criminal background
 
01:48:28.790 --> 01:48:28.800 align:start position:0%
check potentially
 
01:48:30.950 --> 01:48:30.960 align:start position:0%
licensing someone who might have been
 
01:48:33.189 --> 01:48:33.199 align:start position:0%
unemployable pursuant to this list of
 
01:48:36.310 --> 01:48:36.320 align:start position:0%
disqualifying offenses
 
01:48:38.390 --> 01:48:38.400 align:start position:0%
as a state agency we were troubled by
 
01:48:40.310 --> 01:48:40.320 align:start position:0%
that practice and we felt that that did
 
01:48:42.790 --> 01:48:42.800 align:start position:0%
not support the field of education and
 
01:48:44.950 --> 01:48:44.960 align:start position:0%
that did not lift up the field of
 
01:48:44.960 --> 01:48:46.390 align:start position:0%
that did not lift up the field of
education

01:48:46.390 --> 01:48:46.400 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:48:46.400 --> 01:48:47.830 align:start position:0%
education
secondarily

01:48:47.830 --> 01:48:47.840 align:start position:0%
secondarily
 
01:48:50.390 --> 01:48:50.400 align:start position:0%
we did as representative mullen alluded
 
01:48:50.400 --> 01:48:52.310 align:start position:0%
we did as representative mullen alluded
to

01:48:52.310 --> 01:48:52.320 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:48:55.990 --> 01:48:56.000 align:start position:0%
out of curiosity we looked at
 
01:48:59.750 --> 01:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
where our credentials were going
 
01:49:03.189 --> 01:49:03.199 align:start position:0%
and we realized that we took in about a
 
01:49:05.189 --> 01:49:05.199 align:start position:0%
quarter million dollars of credentialing
 
01:49:05.199 --> 01:49:06.470 align:start position:0%
quarter million dollars of credentialing
fees

01:49:06.470 --> 01:49:06.480 align:start position:0%
fees
 
01:49:09.109 --> 01:49:09.119 align:start position:0%
from individuals who had no association
 
01:49:11.109 --> 01:49:11.119 align:start position:0%
with the state of new hampshire no new
 
01:49:11.119 --> 01:49:12.229 align:start position:0%
with the state of new hampshire no new
hampshire

01:49:12.229 --> 01:49:12.239 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:49:14.229 --> 01:49:14.239 align:start position:0%
residents no new hampshire teaching
 
01:49:14.239 --> 01:49:15.589 align:start position:0%
residents no new hampshire teaching
assignment

01:49:15.589 --> 01:49:15.599 align:start position:0%
assignment
 
01:49:17.030 --> 01:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
and what's interesting and i'll share
 
01:49:19.589 --> 01:49:19.599 align:start position:0%
this with the committee is we excluded
 
01:49:21.910 --> 01:49:21.920 align:start position:0%
all the northeast states to include new
 
01:49:21.920 --> 01:49:23.589 align:start position:0%
all the northeast states to include new
york

01:49:23.589 --> 01:49:23.599 align:start position:0%
york
 
01:49:25.189 --> 01:49:25.199 align:start position:0%
and yet we were still pulling in a
 
01:49:26.870 --> 01:49:26.880 align:start position:0%
quarter million dollars in credentialing
 
01:49:28.629 --> 01:49:28.639 align:start position:0%
fees from
 
01:49:30.470 --> 01:49:30.480 align:start position:0%
out of out of state from other parts of
 
01:49:32.790 --> 01:49:32.800 align:start position:0%
the country and we weren't sure why
 
01:49:34.870 --> 01:49:34.880 align:start position:0%
we're still not sure why but we wonder
 
01:49:37.030 --> 01:49:37.040 align:start position:0%
if it's because new hampshire teaching
 
01:49:38.790 --> 01:49:38.800 align:start position:0%
credential did not require a criminal
 
01:49:40.950 --> 01:49:40.960 align:start position:0%
history background check and perhaps
 
01:49:43.030 --> 01:49:43.040 align:start position:0%
people were using that
 
01:49:43.040 --> 01:49:44.149 align:start position:0%
people were using that
license

01:49:44.149 --> 01:49:44.159 align:start position:0%
license
 
01:49:46.550 --> 01:49:46.560 align:start position:0%
to gain reciprocity in other states and
 
01:49:48.629 --> 01:49:48.639 align:start position:0%
we were concerned not just about new
 
01:49:51.030 --> 01:49:51.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire child safety but all
 
01:49:53.990 --> 01:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
children's safety so as an agency we
 
01:49:56.709 --> 01:49:56.719 align:start position:0%
worked very hard and worked in close
 
01:49:58.629 --> 01:49:58.639 align:start position:0%
communication with our partners at the
 
01:50:00.950 --> 01:50:00.960 align:start position:0%
department of safety and
 
01:50:03.350 --> 01:50:03.360 align:start position:0%
senators and representatives to bring
 
01:50:06.790 --> 01:50:06.800 align:start position:0%
forward last session senate bill 134
 
01:50:09.109 --> 01:50:09.119 align:start position:0%
senate bill 134
 
01:50:12.790 --> 01:50:12.800 align:start position:0%
established 189 13 c
 
01:50:14.550 --> 01:50:14.560 align:start position:0%
think of it as kind of a conjunction
 
01:50:17.189 --> 01:50:17.199 align:start position:0%
with 189 13 a
 
01:50:19.589 --> 01:50:19.599 align:start position:0%
189 13 c
 
01:50:22.149 --> 01:50:22.159 align:start position:0%
allows the department of education to
 
01:50:24.149 --> 01:50:24.159 align:start position:0%
run a criminal history check on
 
01:50:26.950 --> 01:50:26.960 align:start position:0%
first-time applicants for employment
 
01:50:29.270 --> 01:50:29.280 align:start position:0%
i emphasize first-time applicants
 
01:50:30.950 --> 01:50:30.960 align:start position:0%
because it is not being done
 
01:50:33.669 --> 01:50:33.679 align:start position:0%
retroactively for people who already
 
01:50:36.229 --> 01:50:36.239 align:start position:0%
have a credential they already have a
 
01:50:39.030 --> 01:50:39.040 align:start position:0%
vested interest in that license
 
01:50:41.109 --> 01:50:41.119 align:start position:0%
but moving forward
 
01:50:43.589 --> 01:50:43.599 align:start position:0%
for first-time applicants the department
 
01:50:45.910 --> 01:50:45.920 align:start position:0%
will do that background check
 
01:50:48.870 --> 01:50:48.880 align:start position:0%
the department is only screening for the
 
01:50:50.550 --> 01:50:50.560 align:start position:0%
offenses that you have in front of you
 
01:50:52.950 --> 01:50:52.960 align:start position:0%
those section 5 violations that's what
 
01:50:56.310 --> 01:50:56.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:58.709 --> 01:50:58.719 align:start position:0%
if someone has one of those section 5
 
01:51:01.430 --> 01:51:01.440 align:start position:0%
violations and you should have that list
 
01:51:03.270 --> 01:51:03.280 align:start position:0%
i call it my cheat sheet list but these
 
01:51:05.430 --> 01:51:05.440 align:start position:0%
are the crimes which bar employment
 
01:51:07.910 --> 01:51:07.920 align:start position:0%
you'll see it's homicide it's child
 
01:51:07.920 --> 01:51:09.350 align:start position:0%
you'll see it's homicide it's child
pornography

01:51:09.350 --> 01:51:09.360 align:start position:0%
pornography
 
01:51:11.350 --> 01:51:11.360 align:start position:0%
it's felonious sexual assault which is
 
01:51:14.470 --> 01:51:14.480 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's version of rape
 
01:51:16.310 --> 01:51:16.320 align:start position:0%
anything that would bar someone from
 
01:51:18.870 --> 01:51:18.880 align:start position:0%
being employed we would not credential
 
01:51:20.470 --> 01:51:20.480 align:start position:0%
them because we don't want to license
 
01:51:24.870 --> 01:51:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:24.880 --> 01:51:26.870 align:start position:0%
 
however

01:51:26.870 --> 01:51:26.880 align:start position:0%
however
 
01:51:29.189 --> 01:51:29.199 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of offenses that are not
 
01:51:32.629 --> 01:51:32.639 align:start position:0%
on this list for example dwi
 
01:51:32.639 --> 01:51:34.629 align:start position:0%
on this list for example dwi
arson

01:51:34.629 --> 01:51:34.639 align:start position:0%
arson
 
01:51:38.070 --> 01:51:38.080 align:start position:0%
things of that nature criminal trespass
 
01:51:41.109 --> 01:51:41.119 align:start position:0%
and school districts have always had
 
01:51:43.189 --> 01:51:43.199 align:start position:0%
more discretion to look
 
01:51:44.950 --> 01:51:44.960 align:start position:0%
into the record
 
01:51:47.430 --> 01:51:47.440 align:start position:0%
at length and so they can use their
 
01:51:49.510 --> 01:51:49.520 align:start position:0%
discretion to say this person wants to
 
01:51:51.990 --> 01:51:52.000 align:start position:0%
be a first grade teacher and yet they
 
01:51:53.830 --> 01:51:53.840 align:start position:0%
have you know
 
01:51:56.310 --> 01:51:56.320 align:start position:0%
a number of dwis or domestic violence
 
01:51:58.870 --> 01:51:58.880 align:start position:0%
assaults that are concerning maybe it's
 
01:52:01.270 --> 01:52:01.280 align:start position:0%
not the right fit for our school for
 
01:52:03.350 --> 01:52:03.360 align:start position:0%
this particular position and so the
 
01:52:06.149 --> 01:52:06.159 align:start position:0%
school district has that
 
01:52:08.390 --> 01:52:08.400 align:start position:0%
ability to to do that discretion the
 
01:52:10.390 --> 01:52:10.400 align:start position:0%
department however does not and i think
 
01:52:13.270 --> 01:52:13.280 align:start position:0%
that's a very important distinction
 
01:52:15.589 --> 01:52:15.599 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to take any questions on
 
01:52:17.350 --> 01:52:17.360 align:start position:0%
that dynamic and structure that the
 
01:52:20.149 --> 01:52:20.159 align:start position:0%
department is currently establishing and
 
01:52:23.350 --> 01:52:23.360 align:start position:0%
then we can turn our attention to
 
01:52:25.270 --> 01:52:25.280 align:start position:0%
the subject of this particular i have
 
01:52:27.270 --> 01:52:27.280 align:start position:0%
one question then i'll let the committee
 
01:52:28.830 --> 01:52:28.840 align:start position:0%
ask questions to you
 
01:52:31.990 --> 01:52:32.000 align:start position:0%
diana we have reciprocity with a number
 
01:52:33.750 --> 01:52:33.760 align:start position:0%
of states yes
 
01:52:35.669 --> 01:52:35.679 align:start position:0%
and we have a person let's say coming
 
01:52:37.430 --> 01:52:37.440 align:start position:0%
from maine which we have reciprocity
 
01:52:38.390 --> 01:52:38.400 align:start position:0%
with me
 
01:52:38.400 --> 01:52:39.189 align:start position:0%
with me
yes

01:52:39.189 --> 01:52:39.199 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:52:41.270 --> 01:52:41.280 align:start position:0%
what kind of check do we do they have
 
01:52:43.189 --> 01:52:43.199 align:start position:0%
certification there so now we're saying
 
01:52:44.629 --> 01:52:44.639 align:start position:0%
do they automatically get this
 
01:52:46.390 --> 01:52:46.400 align:start position:0%
certification what do we do we do a
 
01:52:48.870 --> 01:52:48.880 align:start position:0%
background check or do we have the
 
01:52:51.030 --> 01:52:51.040 align:start position:0%
main do a background check or do you do
 
01:52:53.270 --> 01:52:53.280 align:start position:0%
that how does that work
 
01:52:55.430 --> 01:52:55.440 align:start position:0%
so moving forward pursuant to senate
 
01:52:57.990 --> 01:52:58.000 align:start position:0%
bill 134 which was passed last session
 
01:52:59.510 --> 01:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
the department of education new
 
01:53:01.270 --> 01:53:01.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire's department of education will
 
01:53:03.030 --> 01:53:03.040 align:start position:0%
be doing a background check on that
 
01:53:05.270 --> 01:53:05.280 align:start position:0%
individual whether they come from maine
 
01:53:07.430 --> 01:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
or minnesota or they're coming right out
 
01:53:09.109 --> 01:53:09.119 align:start position:0%
of saint anselm's college from a teacher
 
01:53:10.390 --> 01:53:10.400 align:start position:0%
prep program
 
01:53:11.990 --> 01:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
we will be doing that criminal
 
01:53:13.990 --> 01:53:14.000 align:start position:0%
background check not only is that a new
 
01:53:16.390 --> 01:53:16.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire background check but also the
 
01:53:16.400 --> 01:53:17.830 align:start position:0%
hampshire background check but also the
federal

01:53:17.830 --> 01:53:17.840 align:start position:0%
federal
 
01:53:19.189 --> 01:53:19.199 align:start position:0%
background check
 
01:53:21.910 --> 01:53:21.920 align:start position:0%
we also run individuals through the
 
01:53:23.830 --> 01:53:23.840 align:start position:0%
nationwide database
 
01:53:26.390 --> 01:53:26.400 align:start position:0%
it's called nasdaq
 
01:53:28.070 --> 01:53:28.080 align:start position:0%
i always thought it was a stock market
 
01:53:29.830 --> 01:53:29.840 align:start position:0%
reference but it turned out i was wrong
 
01:53:31.189 --> 01:53:31.199 align:start position:0%
it took me a couple of years to get up
 
01:53:33.669 --> 01:53:33.679 align:start position:0%
to speed on that one but it is a an
 
01:53:36.550 --> 01:53:36.560 align:start position:0%
organization that tracks
 
01:53:40.070 --> 01:53:40.080 align:start position:0%
educators nationwide who have gotten in
 
01:53:42.390 --> 01:53:42.400 align:start position:0%
trouble in their own states
 
01:53:44.870 --> 01:53:44.880 align:start position:0%
and then perhaps seek to move to another
 
01:53:47.350 --> 01:53:47.360 align:start position:0%
state and so again it's called nasdaq
 
01:53:47.360 --> 01:53:48.229 align:start position:0%
state and so again it's called nasdaq
and

01:53:48.229 --> 01:53:48.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:53:49.350 --> 01:53:49.360 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire department of
 
01:53:51.830 --> 01:53:51.840 align:start position:0%
education will run a query through
 
01:53:54.470 --> 01:53:54.480 align:start position:0%
nasdaq to see if that individual has had
 
01:53:57.030 --> 01:53:57.040 align:start position:0%
any issues in other states nationwide
 
01:53:58.310 --> 01:53:58.320 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:53:59.589 --> 01:53:59.599 align:start position:0%
members of the committee representative
 
01:53:59.599 --> 01:54:01.910 align:start position:0%
members of the committee representative
tanner

01:54:01.910 --> 01:54:01.920 align:start position:0%
tanner
 
01:54:03.669 --> 01:54:03.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
01:54:05.589 --> 01:54:05.599 align:start position:0%
attorney fenton um
 
01:54:07.109 --> 01:54:07.119 align:start position:0%
when we were doing this before with
 
01:54:09.669 --> 01:54:09.679 align:start position:0%
employees we had an issue with bus
 
01:54:09.679 --> 01:54:11.030 align:start position:0%
employees we had an issue with bus
drivers

01:54:11.030 --> 01:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
drivers
 
01:54:12.790 --> 01:54:12.800 align:start position:0%
substitute teachers
 
01:54:14.229 --> 01:54:14.239 align:start position:0%
people who move
 
01:54:15.750 --> 01:54:15.760 align:start position:0%
throughout the district and were getting
 
01:54:17.669 --> 01:54:17.679 align:start position:0%
hammered with criminal background checks
 
01:54:19.669 --> 01:54:19.679 align:start position:0%
every time they turned around
 
01:54:21.510 --> 01:54:21.520 align:start position:0%
has anything been done to solve that
 
01:54:21.520 --> 01:54:22.709 align:start position:0%
has anything been done to solve that
issue

01:54:22.709 --> 01:54:22.719 align:start position:0%
issue
 
01:54:25.109 --> 01:54:25.119 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for the question um we
 
01:54:28.390 --> 01:54:28.400 align:start position:0%
have successfully uh perhaps i i hate to
 
01:54:30.709 --> 01:54:30.719 align:start position:0%
use the word solved it feels so arrogant
 
01:54:32.229 --> 01:54:32.239 align:start position:0%
and i just wait for someone to call me
 
01:54:34.310 --> 01:54:34.320 align:start position:0%
and say we still have a problem so i'm
 
01:54:36.709 --> 01:54:36.719 align:start position:0%
going to use that term very loosely but
 
01:54:38.070 --> 01:54:38.080 align:start position:0%
we have um
 
01:54:39.430 --> 01:54:39.440 align:start position:0%
we're get we're going to use the term
 
01:54:42.149 --> 01:54:42.159 align:start position:0%
addressed we have adequately addressed
 
01:54:44.709 --> 01:54:44.719 align:start position:0%
the bus driver issue and so what we have
 
01:54:46.390 --> 01:54:46.400 align:start position:0%
done is um
 
01:54:47.990 --> 01:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
and i want to just back up a step and
 
01:54:50.550 --> 01:54:50.560 align:start position:0%
give a little historical context one of
 
01:54:51.990 --> 01:54:52.000 align:start position:0%
the issues we are having with bus
 
01:54:53.510 --> 01:54:53.520 align:start position:0%
drivers which representative tanner
 
01:54:54.950 --> 01:54:54.960 align:start position:0%
knows very well
 
01:54:54.960 --> 01:54:55.990 align:start position:0%
knows very well
is

01:54:55.990 --> 01:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:54:58.870 --> 01:54:58.880 align:start position:0%
typically they are owned by private
 
01:55:00.870 --> 01:55:00.880 align:start position:0%
companies so for example it might be
 
01:55:03.430 --> 01:55:03.440 align:start position:0%
butler's bus service it's not owned by
 
01:55:05.030 --> 01:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
the school district it's owned by a
 
01:55:07.589 --> 01:55:07.599 align:start position:0%
private company and what happened around
 
01:55:10.470 --> 01:55:10.480 align:start position:0%
2018 2019
 
01:55:13.910 --> 01:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
is that the fbi record the nationwide
 
01:55:15.510 --> 01:55:15.520 align:start position:0%
criminal history check
 
01:55:18.790 --> 01:55:18.800 align:start position:0%
could no longer be dispersed to
 
01:55:20.870 --> 01:55:20.880 align:start position:0%
a private company butler's bus service
 
01:55:21.990 --> 01:55:22.000 align:start position:0%
for example
 
01:55:24.310 --> 01:55:24.320 align:start position:0%
because they were a non-governmental
 
01:55:24.320 --> 01:55:25.750 align:start position:0%
because they were a non-governmental
entity

01:55:25.750 --> 01:55:25.760 align:start position:0%
entity
 
01:55:28.070 --> 01:55:28.080 align:start position:0%
but we realized in working with the bus
 
01:55:31.589 --> 01:55:31.599 align:start position:0%
lobby that the department of education
 
01:55:34.310 --> 01:55:34.320 align:start position:0%
is a governmental entity
 
01:55:39.510 --> 01:55:39.520 align:start position:0%
and so we created uh statutorily 189 13b
 
01:55:41.510 --> 01:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
which allows for the department of
 
01:55:44.070 --> 01:55:44.080 align:start position:0%
education to issue a
 
01:55:46.390 --> 01:55:46.400 align:start position:0%
clearance a criminal history clearance
 
01:55:48.470 --> 01:55:48.480 align:start position:0%
to bus drivers so the department of
 
01:55:51.270 --> 01:55:51.280 align:start position:0%
motor vehicles license them to drive
 
01:55:53.109 --> 01:55:53.119 align:start position:0%
that falls outside of the department's
 
01:55:55.350 --> 01:55:55.360 align:start position:0%
purview as one would suspect
 
01:55:57.669 --> 01:55:57.679 align:start position:0%
they are licensed to drive a bus and
 
01:55:59.910 --> 01:55:59.920 align:start position:0%
they get their cdl and then they come to
 
01:56:02.310 --> 01:56:02.320 align:start position:0%
the department of education and we do a
 
01:56:05.270 --> 01:56:05.280 align:start position:0%
clearance that clearance is good
 
01:56:05.280 --> 01:56:06.870 align:start position:0%
clearance that clearance is good
statewide

01:56:06.870 --> 01:56:06.880 align:start position:0%
statewide
 
01:56:09.109 --> 01:56:09.119 align:start position:0%
and pun intended this gives the bus
 
01:56:11.990 --> 01:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
drivers mobility to move from district
 
01:56:14.470 --> 01:56:14.480 align:start position:0%
to district to district so if
 
01:56:17.430 --> 01:56:17.440 align:start position:0%
district 1 has a field trip
 
01:56:19.109 --> 01:56:19.119 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden they can call the second
 
01:56:20.709 --> 01:56:20.719 align:start position:0%
district and say do you have any bus
 
01:56:22.629 --> 01:56:22.639 align:start position:0%
drivers that are available and those
 
01:56:24.550 --> 01:56:24.560 align:start position:0%
individual school districts do not have
 
01:56:25.910 --> 01:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
to run
 
01:56:27.990 --> 01:56:28.000 align:start position:0%
background checks on these individuals
 
01:56:29.750 --> 01:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
so we're just starting that program
 
01:56:31.189 --> 01:56:31.199 align:start position:0%
we've just put our rules in place and
 
01:56:32.629 --> 01:56:32.639 align:start position:0%
we've just gotten the approval from the
 
01:56:35.910 --> 01:56:35.920 align:start position:0%
fbi um so i can't say that it's again
 
01:56:37.990 --> 01:56:38.000 align:start position:0%
pun intended up and running quite yet
 
01:56:41.830 --> 01:56:41.840 align:start position:0%
but we are very very close to doing that
 
01:56:41.840 --> 01:56:44.229 align:start position:0%
but we are very very close to doing that
up

01:56:44.229 --> 01:56:44.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:46.310 --> 01:56:46.320 align:start position:0%
uh congratulations because we think
 
01:56:47.830 --> 01:56:47.840 align:start position:0%
you've done that a lot
 
01:56:47.840 --> 01:56:48.709 align:start position:0%
you've done that a lot
um

01:56:48.709 --> 01:56:48.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:51.350 --> 01:56:51.360 align:start position:0%
what about substitute teachers
 
01:56:54.310 --> 01:56:54.320 align:start position:0%
and other uh you know now a lot of
 
01:56:56.310 --> 01:56:56.320 align:start position:0%
schools are getting cleaning agencies
 
01:56:56.320 --> 01:56:57.270 align:start position:0%
schools are getting cleaning agencies
because

01:56:57.270 --> 01:56:57.280 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:56:58.709 --> 01:56:58.719 align:start position:0%
of covid
 
01:57:00.390 --> 01:57:00.400 align:start position:0%
what about all these other people that
 
01:57:00.400 --> 01:57:01.510 align:start position:0%
what about all these other people that
are

01:57:01.510 --> 01:57:01.520 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:57:03.189 --> 01:57:03.199 align:start position:0%
third party or even
 
01:57:04.870 --> 01:57:04.880 align:start position:0%
you know later today we're gonna i think
 
01:57:06.390 --> 01:57:06.400 align:start position:0%
we hit the
 
01:57:07.510 --> 01:57:07.520 align:start position:0%
bill on
 
01:57:10.629 --> 01:57:10.639 align:start position:0%
big buses the premier buses that are
 
01:57:13.109 --> 01:57:13.119 align:start position:0%
hired for you know field trips and and
 
01:57:15.270 --> 01:57:15.280 align:start position:0%
sporting events what about those are
 
01:57:18.229 --> 01:57:18.239 align:start position:0%
they still in kind of no man's land or
 
01:57:20.629 --> 01:57:20.639 align:start position:0%
so i i can't speak to private bus
 
01:57:24.550 --> 01:57:24.560 align:start position:0%
companies um a little bit out of my
 
01:57:27.910 --> 01:57:27.920 align:start position:0%
realm of authority here um but you have
 
01:57:31.030 --> 01:57:31.040 align:start position:0%
identified that there remains an
 
01:57:32.629 --> 01:57:32.639 align:start position:0%
overarching issue
 
01:57:34.310 --> 01:57:34.320 align:start position:0%
in the field of education because there
 
01:57:36.310 --> 01:57:36.320 align:start position:0%
are so many people who go through the
 
01:57:38.310 --> 01:57:38.320 align:start position:0%
school doors it's so surprising to me
 
01:57:40.550 --> 01:57:40.560 align:start position:0%
when you think about how many people
 
01:57:43.109 --> 01:57:43.119 align:start position:0%
enter a school and we recognize the
 
01:57:44.390 --> 01:57:44.400 align:start position:0%
importance of those criminal history
 
01:57:45.910 --> 01:57:45.920 align:start position:0%
background checks that's never up for
 
01:57:45.920 --> 01:57:46.950 align:start position:0%
background checks that's never up for
debate

01:57:46.950 --> 01:57:46.960 align:start position:0%
debate
 
01:57:49.270 --> 01:57:49.280 align:start position:0%
but then the question becomes how do we
 
01:57:51.669 --> 01:57:51.679 align:start position:0%
make sure that everyone has access to
 
01:57:53.589 --> 01:57:53.599 align:start position:0%
get into these schools
 
01:57:56.709 --> 01:57:56.719 align:start position:0%
but it's not becoming overly burdensome
 
01:57:58.229 --> 01:57:58.239 align:start position:0%
i think that the
 
01:57:59.750 --> 01:57:59.760 align:start position:0%
the department
 
01:58:02.470 --> 01:58:02.480 align:start position:0%
can play a very critical role because
 
01:58:04.950 --> 01:58:04.960 align:start position:0%
again we are a governmental entity
 
01:58:07.350 --> 01:58:07.360 align:start position:0%
i am always the first to say
 
01:58:09.669 --> 01:58:09.679 align:start position:0%
we need to be very thoughtful about how
 
01:58:11.669 --> 01:58:11.679 align:start position:0%
we establish this i'm always the one
 
01:58:13.510 --> 01:58:13.520 align:start position:0%
kind of holding things back a little bit
 
01:58:13.520 --> 01:58:14.709 align:start position:0%
kind of holding things back a little bit
admittedly

01:58:14.709 --> 01:58:14.719 align:start position:0%
admittedly
 
01:58:16.310 --> 01:58:16.320 align:start position:0%
because i want to make sure that
 
01:58:18.310 --> 01:58:18.320 align:start position:0%
anything the department takes on that we
 
01:58:21.270 --> 01:58:21.280 align:start position:0%
can do so successfully because if we
 
01:58:23.910 --> 01:58:23.920 align:start position:0%
mess up kids are harmed
 
01:58:26.229 --> 01:58:26.239 align:start position:0%
and that is not okay that is not okay
 
01:58:28.950 --> 01:58:28.960 align:start position:0%
with me or commissioner edelblut and so
 
01:58:31.669 --> 01:58:31.679 align:start position:0%
we are very thoughtful in our process on
 
01:58:33.589 --> 01:58:33.599 align:start position:0%
taking on those additional
 
01:58:33.599 --> 01:58:34.470 align:start position:0%
taking on those additional
entities

01:58:34.470 --> 01:58:34.480 align:start position:0%
entities
 
01:58:36.709 --> 01:58:36.719 align:start position:0%
but we recognize that
 
01:58:39.270 --> 01:58:39.280 align:start position:0%
that is a very i think critical role
 
01:58:40.790 --> 01:58:40.800 align:start position:0%
that the department
 
01:58:43.189 --> 01:58:43.199 align:start position:0%
can play but we haven't played it
 
01:58:43.199 --> 01:58:44.550 align:start position:0%
can play but we haven't played it
historically

01:58:44.550 --> 01:58:44.560 align:start position:0%
historically
 
01:58:46.950 --> 01:58:46.960 align:start position:0%
and so anytime we kind of pivot and
 
01:58:48.629 --> 01:58:48.639 align:start position:0%
shift the role that we play or the
 
01:58:51.270 --> 01:58:51.280 align:start position:0%
service that we provide um we really
 
01:58:53.189 --> 01:58:53.199 align:start position:0%
have to do so
 
01:58:56.070 --> 01:58:56.080 align:start position:0%
thoughtfully um because the implications
 
01:58:58.310 --> 01:58:58.320 align:start position:0%
of it i think are too grave if we don't
 
01:59:00.310 --> 01:59:00.320 align:start position:0%
so substitute teachers in short
 
01:59:02.390 --> 01:59:02.400 align:start position:0%
representative tanner are kind of next
 
01:59:04.470 --> 01:59:04.480 align:start position:0%
on our list if you will we're looking at
 
01:59:06.550 --> 01:59:06.560 align:start position:0%
how we can help the field in that in
 
01:59:08.310 --> 01:59:08.320 align:start position:0%
that area
 
01:59:11.109 --> 01:59:11.119 align:start position:0%
we did have a bill presented last week i
 
01:59:13.750 --> 01:59:13.760 align:start position:0%
believe in senate education
 
01:59:15.669 --> 01:59:15.679 align:start position:0%
that will help facilitate substitute
 
01:59:17.830 --> 01:59:17.840 align:start position:0%
teachers a little bit has nothing to do
 
01:59:18.950 --> 01:59:18.960 align:start position:0%
directly with the department of
 
01:59:18.960 --> 01:59:21.990 align:start position:0%
directly with the department of
education

01:59:21.990 --> 01:59:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:24.070 --> 01:59:24.080 align:start position:0%
let's see if others have any are there
 
01:59:25.910 --> 01:59:25.920 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the rest of the
 
01:59:28.310 --> 01:59:28.320 align:start position:0%
committee if not we'll go with
 
01:59:30.229 --> 01:59:30.239 align:start position:0%
representative cornell thank you and
 
01:59:32.229 --> 01:59:32.239 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um in
 
01:59:34.470 --> 01:59:34.480 align:start position:0%
the top line it says school volunt
 
01:59:36.950 --> 01:59:36.960 align:start position:0%
designated school volunteer would that
 
01:59:39.189 --> 01:59:39.199 align:start position:0%
include people safe that are doing the
 
01:59:42.310 --> 01:59:42.320 align:start position:0%
predna program or learn everywhere that
 
01:59:43.430 --> 01:59:43.440 align:start position:0%
have been
 
01:59:47.109 --> 01:59:47.119 align:start position:0%
okay to provide those out of school
 
01:59:49.510 --> 01:59:49.520 align:start position:0%
programs that kids will get credit for
 
01:59:50.950 --> 01:59:50.960 align:start position:0%
in school
 
01:59:53.030 --> 01:59:53.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um
 
01:59:54.870 --> 01:59:54.880 align:start position:0%
the short answer is i'm not entirely
 
01:59:56.629 --> 01:59:56.639 align:start position:0%
sure i know the term designated
 
01:59:59.430 --> 01:59:59.440 align:start position:0%
volunteer is defined by each individual
 
02:00:03.270 --> 02:00:03.280 align:start position:0%
district the law 18913a
 
02:00:05.430 --> 02:00:05.440 align:start position:0%
gives deference to districts to define
 
02:00:07.750 --> 02:00:07.760 align:start position:0%
what a designated volunteer could be so
 
02:00:10.149 --> 02:00:10.159 align:start position:0%
the best example i can give is if i go
 
02:00:12.629 --> 02:00:12.639 align:start position:0%
to my child's school for
 
02:00:15.189 --> 02:00:15.199 align:start position:0%
a halloween party i'm not a designated
 
02:00:17.430 --> 02:00:17.440 align:start position:0%
volunteer i'm there for one occasion i
 
02:00:19.910 --> 02:00:19.920 align:start position:0%
don't have individual access to children
 
02:00:22.310 --> 02:00:22.320 align:start position:0%
but if i am to participate on a weekly
 
02:00:23.910 --> 02:00:23.920 align:start position:0%
basis in a program
 
02:00:26.070 --> 02:00:26.080 align:start position:0%
then i would presumably fall under the
 
02:00:28.390 --> 02:00:28.400 align:start position:0%
designated volunteer
 
02:00:29.430 --> 02:00:29.440 align:start position:0%
i don't
 
02:00:31.910 --> 02:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
know i i believe that those individual
 
02:00:34.629 --> 02:00:34.639 align:start position:0%
programs that you listed have their own
 
02:00:37.430 --> 02:00:37.440 align:start position:0%
um background check policies pursuant to
 
02:00:39.990 --> 02:00:40.000 align:start position:0%
them i know that is very near and dear
 
02:00:42.870 --> 02:00:42.880 align:start position:0%
to uh the department's heart um and it
 
02:00:44.870 --> 02:00:44.880 align:start position:0%
is our top priority quite simply child
 
02:00:46.390 --> 02:00:46.400 align:start position:0%
safety is always the department's top
 
02:00:49.270 --> 02:00:49.280 align:start position:0%
priority however individual districts
 
02:00:51.189 --> 02:00:51.199 align:start position:0%
could account for those programs within
 
02:00:52.629 --> 02:00:52.639 align:start position:0%
their individual
 
02:00:55.510 --> 02:00:55.520 align:start position:0%
policies of designated volunteers
 
02:00:59.270 --> 02:00:59.280 align:start position:0%
thank you uh further questions
 
02:01:00.950 --> 02:01:00.960 align:start position:0%
yes representative nelson
 
02:01:02.709 --> 02:01:02.719 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
02:01:04.870 --> 02:01:04.880 align:start position:0%
how about i'll use tin mountain
 
02:01:06.870 --> 02:01:06.880 align:start position:0%
conservation what happens if they put on
 
02:01:09.189 --> 02:01:09.199 align:start position:0%
a program in a local school is there any
 
02:01:11.030 --> 02:01:11.040 align:start position:0%
check on that
 
02:01:13.589 --> 02:01:13.599 align:start position:0%
again that would depend on the
 
02:01:16.470 --> 02:01:16.480 align:start position:0%
designated volunteer
 
02:01:19.109 --> 02:01:19.119 align:start position:0%
policy at that particular school
 
02:01:20.550 --> 02:01:20.560 align:start position:0%
if it's a
 
02:01:23.750 --> 02:01:23.760 align:start position:0%
in speaking in general terms if it is a
 
02:01:27.189 --> 02:01:27.199 align:start position:0%
one-time interaction in the school
 
02:01:29.910 --> 02:01:29.920 align:start position:0%
that might fall outside of that term
 
02:01:31.990 --> 02:01:32.000 align:start position:0%
designated volunteer but if you look at
 
02:01:33.990 --> 02:01:34.000 align:start position:0%
189 13 a
 
02:01:36.550 --> 02:01:36.560 align:start position:0%
the statute gives deference to
 
02:01:39.030 --> 02:01:39.040 align:start position:0%
individual school districts
 
02:01:40.629 --> 02:01:40.639 align:start position:0%
a few years ago when this committee
 
02:01:44.629 --> 02:01:44.639 align:start position:0%
started looking and revising 18913a
 
02:01:46.070 --> 02:01:46.080 align:start position:0%
a lot of school districts had the
 
02:01:48.870 --> 02:01:48.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity to revamp their designated
 
02:01:50.709 --> 02:01:50.719 align:start position:0%
volunteer policy they had not looked at
 
02:01:52.229 --> 02:01:52.239 align:start position:0%
it in quite a bit and so this
 
02:01:54.709 --> 02:01:54.719 align:start position:0%
committee's work on this important topic
 
02:01:56.709 --> 02:01:56.719 align:start position:0%
spurred a lot of districts to revise
 
02:01:59.990 --> 02:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
that and look at what that term meant so
 
02:02:02.070 --> 02:02:02.080 align:start position:0%
at one district to answer your question
 
02:02:03.750 --> 02:02:03.760 align:start position:0%
representative nelson at one district
 
02:02:07.109 --> 02:02:07.119 align:start position:0%
they could define tin mountain as
 
02:02:09.510 --> 02:02:09.520 align:start position:0%
uh as a designated volunteer and ask
 
02:02:11.669 --> 02:02:11.679 align:start position:0%
them to have a background check and the
 
02:02:14.070 --> 02:02:14.080 align:start position:0%
next district over could say no we feel
 
02:02:14.080 --> 02:02:15.430 align:start position:0%
next district over could say no we feel
comfortable

02:02:15.430 --> 02:02:15.440 align:start position:0%
comfortable
 
02:02:19.030 --> 02:02:19.040 align:start position:0%
not having them go through that process
 
02:02:21.750 --> 02:02:21.760 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions okay going
 
02:02:24.310 --> 02:02:24.320 align:start position:0%
back to represent tanner
 
02:02:26.790 --> 02:02:26.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um
 
02:02:28.629 --> 02:02:28.639 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering about charter schools
 
02:02:30.870 --> 02:02:30.880 align:start position:0%
where only 50 of the teachers have to be
 
02:02:30.880 --> 02:02:32.390 align:start position:0%
where only 50 of the teachers have to be
credentialed

02:02:32.390 --> 02:02:32.400 align:start position:0%
credentialed
 
02:02:34.950 --> 02:02:34.960 align:start position:0%
are the other 50 percent considered
 
02:02:36.870 --> 02:02:36.880 align:start position:0%
long-term subs or
 
02:02:39.750 --> 02:02:39.760 align:start position:0%
how how exactly
 
02:02:40.709 --> 02:02:40.719 align:start position:0%
do they
 
02:02:42.310 --> 02:02:42.320 align:start position:0%
they don't have to apply for a
 
02:02:42.320 --> 02:02:43.830 align:start position:0%
they don't have to apply for a
credential

02:02:43.830 --> 02:02:43.840 align:start position:0%
credential
 
02:02:46.709 --> 02:02:46.719 align:start position:0%
to teach in a in a charter school so
 
02:02:49.910 --> 02:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
how how does that work and and what kind
 
02:02:53.270 --> 02:02:53.280 align:start position:0%
of rule changes are there for that
 
02:02:55.830 --> 02:02:55.840 align:start position:0%
so i think it's important to recognize
 
02:02:58.070 --> 02:02:58.080 align:start position:0%
when you look at 189 the structure we've
 
02:03:01.830 --> 02:03:01.840 align:start position:0%
created 189 a is employment and so
 
02:03:04.629 --> 02:03:04.639 align:start position:0%
whether i'm a credentialed educator
 
02:03:07.030 --> 02:03:07.040 align:start position:0%
working at a charter school or i'm not i
 
02:03:09.589 --> 02:03:09.599 align:start position:0%
am still subject to the background check
 
02:03:12.229 --> 02:03:12.239 align:start position:0%
upon employment and that's critical and
 
02:03:14.070 --> 02:03:14.080 align:start position:0%
that does not waver that does not change
 
02:03:16.149 --> 02:03:16.159 align:start position:0%
across the board
 
02:03:19.189 --> 02:03:19.199 align:start position:0%
189 13 b
 
02:03:21.750 --> 02:03:21.760 align:start position:0%
addresses the bus drivers and my little
 
02:03:25.270 --> 02:03:25.280 align:start position:0%
cheat sheet way is b for bus driver
 
02:03:30.070 --> 02:03:30.080 align:start position:0%
and 189 13 c c for credentialing
 
02:03:33.030 --> 02:03:33.040 align:start position:0%
that's real insight into my brain but
 
02:03:35.430 --> 02:03:35.440 align:start position:0%
that's statutorily how we've created it
 
02:03:38.390 --> 02:03:38.400 align:start position:0%
and it makes sense a b c and you have
 
02:03:40.390 --> 02:03:40.400 align:start position:0%
all these different designations but for
 
02:03:43.189 --> 02:03:43.199 align:start position:0%
charter schools whether they are
 
02:03:45.430 --> 02:03:45.440 align:start position:0%
credentialed or they're not
 
02:03:48.550 --> 02:03:48.560 align:start position:0%
everyone who steps into that school
 
02:03:50.870 --> 02:03:50.880 align:start position:0%
is subject to that that employment or
 
02:03:54.830 --> 02:03:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:57.189 --> 02:03:57.199 align:start position:0%
18913a you are there further questions
 
02:04:00.069 --> 02:04:00.079 align:start position:0%
for the department
 
02:04:01.990 --> 02:04:02.000 align:start position:0%
not seeing any thank you very much for
 
02:04:03.830 --> 02:04:03.840 align:start position:0%

represent lakers do you have your hand
up

02:04:09.750 --> 02:04:09.760 align:start position:0%
up
 
02:04:11.430 --> 02:04:11.440 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry you were then going to go on
 
02:04:13.270 --> 02:04:13.280 align:start position:0%
to the specifics of this bill and the
 
02:04:15.750 --> 02:04:15.760 align:start position:0%
questions we asked on it sure
 
02:04:15.760 --> 02:04:16.709 align:start position:0%
questions we asked on it sure
like

02:04:16.709 --> 02:04:16.719 align:start position:0%
like
 
02:04:18.550 --> 02:04:18.560 align:start position:0%
asking about
 
02:04:21.030 --> 02:04:21.040 align:start position:0%
possession of a controlled drug and is
 
02:04:21.040 --> 02:04:21.910 align:start position:0%
possession of a controlled drug and is
that

02:04:21.910 --> 02:04:21.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:04:23.669 --> 02:04:23.679 align:start position:0%
is there any kind of
 
02:04:27.109 --> 02:04:27.119 align:start position:0%
like lower limit be underneath which
 
02:04:29.350 --> 02:04:29.360 align:start position:0%
they you know are we going for
 
02:04:31.910 --> 02:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
big time drug dealers are we going for
 
02:04:34.390 --> 02:04:34.400 align:start position:0%
the stupid kid who made a mistake in
 
02:04:36.470 --> 02:04:36.480 align:start position:0%
college when they were experimenting and
 
02:04:38.790 --> 02:04:38.800 align:start position:0%
picked up some drugs for their friends
 
02:04:40.870 --> 02:04:40.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um to be
 
02:04:40.880 --> 02:04:43.270 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um to be
clear

02:04:43.270 --> 02:04:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:45.109 --> 02:04:45.119 align:start position:0%
it's interesting to the department when
 
02:04:47.189 --> 02:04:47.199 align:start position:0%
you look at this list of crimes which
 
02:04:49.189 --> 02:04:49.199 align:start position:0%
bar employment and education
 
02:04:52.950 --> 02:04:52.960 align:start position:0%
there are no drug offenses on this list
 
02:04:55.750 --> 02:04:55.760 align:start position:0%
there are no drug offenses and yet
 
02:04:58.310 --> 02:04:58.320 align:start position:0%
we're putting people in contact with
 
02:04:59.910 --> 02:04:59.920 align:start position:0%
with children which is a high-risk
 
02:05:02.709 --> 02:05:02.719 align:start position:0%
population and we all recognize that
 
02:05:05.430 --> 02:05:05.440 align:start position:0%
the department's intent is not
 
02:05:06.629 --> 02:05:06.639 align:start position:0%
to target
 
02:05:08.950 --> 02:05:08.960 align:start position:0%
um people who made a mistake or had
 
02:05:08.960 --> 02:05:10.149 align:start position:0%
um people who made a mistake or had
simple

02:05:10.149 --> 02:05:10.159 align:start position:0%
simple
 
02:05:12.390 --> 02:05:12.400 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor level possession
 
02:05:15.189 --> 02:05:15.199 align:start position:0%
this this bill before you does not it is
 
02:05:18.390 --> 02:05:18.400 align:start position:0%
not intended to target um
 
02:05:20.149 --> 02:05:20.159 align:start position:0%
personal possession personal use
 
02:05:22.310 --> 02:05:22.320 align:start position:0%
anything like that what we're trying to
 
02:05:24.550 --> 02:05:24.560 align:start position:0%
do with this bill is recognize that
 
02:05:27.109 --> 02:05:27.119 align:start position:0%
there are the offenses of possession
 
02:05:29.910 --> 02:05:29.920 align:start position:0%
with intent to distribute
 
02:05:29.920 --> 02:05:30.709 align:start position:0%
with intent to distribute
or

02:05:30.709 --> 02:05:30.719 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:05:32.709 --> 02:05:32.719 align:start position:0%
possession with intent to sell either
 
02:05:35.910 --> 02:05:35.920 align:start position:0%
way you want to put it in that offense
 
02:05:37.510 --> 02:05:37.520 align:start position:0%
felony level
 
02:05:39.910 --> 02:05:39.920 align:start position:0%
we feel is concerning enough
 
02:05:42.470 --> 02:05:42.480 align:start position:0%
to keep away from our classroom and our
 
02:05:45.270 --> 02:05:45.280 align:start position:0%
children but that is why you see this
 
02:05:45.280 --> 02:05:46.550 align:start position:0%
children but that is why you see this
additional

02:05:46.550 --> 02:05:46.560 align:start position:0%
additional
 
02:05:48.709 --> 02:05:48.719 align:start position:0%
language in this proposed bill before
 
02:05:50.870 --> 02:05:50.880 align:start position:0%
you because we really wanted to make it
 
02:05:53.109 --> 02:05:53.119 align:start position:0%
clear what the intent was that we wanted
 
02:05:55.270 --> 02:05:55.280 align:start position:0%
to go for this possession with intent to
 
02:05:58.069 --> 02:05:58.079 align:start position:0%
distribute we feel that that is a crime
 
02:06:00.229 --> 02:06:00.239 align:start position:0%
that we want out of the classroom and
 
02:06:02.950 --> 02:06:02.960 align:start position:0%
away from children
 
02:06:04.950 --> 02:06:04.960 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
02:06:07.109 --> 02:06:07.119 align:start position:0%
not seeing any further hands uh
 
02:06:08.790 --> 02:06:08.800 align:start position:0%
appreciate it once yes representative
 
02:06:08.800 --> 02:06:11.109 align:start position:0%
appreciate it once yes representative
hall

02:06:11.109 --> 02:06:11.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:12.870 --> 02:06:12.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
02:06:14.470 --> 02:06:14.480 align:start position:0%
taking my question so what happens to
 
02:06:16.870 --> 02:06:16.880 align:start position:0%
the existing employee a lot of this
 
02:06:18.390 --> 02:06:18.400 align:start position:0%
seems to be about that person getting
 
02:06:19.990 --> 02:06:20.000 align:start position:0%
employed so i've been working in the
 
02:06:21.910 --> 02:06:21.920 align:start position:0%
district for 30 years and i did
 
02:06:23.350 --> 02:06:23.360 align:start position:0%
something 10 years ago and i never
 
02:06:24.950 --> 02:06:24.960 align:start position:0%
reported it even though maybe the school
 
02:06:26.629 --> 02:06:26.639 align:start position:0%
district policy says i must report it
 
02:06:27.750 --> 02:06:27.760 align:start position:0%
but i didn't
 
02:06:30.229 --> 02:06:30.239 align:start position:0%
and they've just come upon it do i am i
 
02:06:32.069 --> 02:06:32.079 align:start position:0%
shown the door right then or
 
02:06:32.079 --> 02:06:33.030 align:start position:0%
shown the door right then or
so

02:06:33.030 --> 02:06:33.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:06:35.030 --> 02:06:35.040 align:start position:0%
this bill would not be applied
 
02:06:35.040 --> 02:06:36.550 align:start position:0%
this bill would not be applied
retroactively

02:06:36.550 --> 02:06:36.560 align:start position:0%
retroactively
 
02:06:38.149 --> 02:06:38.159 align:start position:0%
and i think that's really the crux of
 
02:06:39.270 --> 02:06:39.280 align:start position:0%
your question
 
02:06:39.280 --> 02:06:40.550 align:start position:0%
your question
um

02:06:40.550 --> 02:06:40.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:42.870 --> 02:06:42.880 align:start position:0%
this would not suddenly i i do not
 
02:06:44.790 --> 02:06:44.800 align:start position:0%
envision that this bill would suddenly
 
02:06:46.870 --> 02:06:46.880 align:start position:0%
require school districts to then
 
02:06:49.430 --> 02:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
re-fingerprint the law is clear it is
 
02:06:52.310 --> 02:06:52.320 align:start position:0%
upon employment um any change that we
 
02:06:55.750 --> 02:06:55.760 align:start position:0%
have made to 189 13 a over the past five
 
02:06:57.910 --> 02:06:57.920 align:start position:0%
or six years has not ever been
 
02:06:59.910 --> 02:06:59.920 align:start position:0%
interpreted retroactively so this would
 
02:07:01.910 --> 02:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
be moving forward
 
02:07:01.920 --> 02:07:02.870 align:start position:0%
be moving forward
um

02:07:02.870 --> 02:07:02.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:07:04.950 --> 02:07:04.960 align:start position:0%
upon new employment and if someone moves
 
02:07:06.790 --> 02:07:06.800 align:start position:0%
from one district to another district
 
02:07:10.149 --> 02:07:10.159 align:start position:0%
they would be subject to 189 13 a
 
02:07:12.470 --> 02:07:12.480 align:start position:0%
in the employment provision
 
02:07:14.390 --> 02:07:14.400 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much further
 
02:07:14.400 --> 02:07:15.830 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much further
questions

02:07:15.830 --> 02:07:15.840 align:start position:0%

not seeing in hands thank you very much
 
02:07:18.550 --> 02:07:18.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:07:20.709 --> 02:07:20.719 align:start position:0%
we have no further cards on this so we
 
02:07:22.550 --> 02:07:22.560 align:start position:0%
will call this hearing
 
02:07:22.560 --> 02:07:24.069 align:start position:0%
will call this hearing
closed

02:07:24.069 --> 02:07:24.079 align:start position:0%
closed
 
02:07:26.790 --> 02:07:26.800 align:start position:0%
and we will now get ready to go into the
 
02:07:30.550 --> 02:07:30.560 align:start position:0%
next bill which is hb 1234
 
02:07:32.550 --> 02:07:32.560 align:start position:0%
relative to criminal background checks
 
02:07:34.069 --> 02:07:34.079 align:start position:0%
for an applicant for a teaching
 
02:07:34.079 --> 02:07:45.669 align:start position:0%
for an applicant for a teaching
credential

section c
 
02:08:42.790 --> 02:08:42.800 align:start position:0%

human trafficking
 
02:09:01.030 --> 02:09:01.040 align:start position:0%
because uh it was a little bit like
 
02:09:04.229 --> 02:09:04.239 align:start position:0%

so
 
02:09:59.910 --> 02:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
uh representative or attorney fenton
 
02:10:01.430 --> 02:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
mentioned that there is a national
 
02:10:03.430 --> 02:10:03.440 align:start position:0%
clearinghouse i think nasdaq the one she
 
02:10:07.430 --> 02:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:07.440 --> 02:10:08.149 align:start position:0%
 
the

02:10:08.149 --> 02:10:08.159 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:10:10.069 --> 02:10:10.079 align:start position:0%
stock market
 
02:10:12.390 --> 02:10:12.400 align:start position:0%
what happens to again
 
02:10:14.709 --> 02:10:14.719 align:start position:0%
charter school teachers educators who
 
02:10:16.550 --> 02:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
are not credentialed because we know
 
02:10:19.109 --> 02:10:19.119 align:start position:0%
that only 50 of them are credentialed or
 
02:10:20.229 --> 02:10:20.239 align:start position:0%
have to be
 
02:10:23.350 --> 02:10:23.360 align:start position:0%
um do they go into a database as well i
 
02:10:25.109 --> 02:10:25.119 align:start position:0%
wish i could answer that question for
 
02:10:27.350 --> 02:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
you but playing stump the representative
 
02:10:29.750 --> 02:10:29.760 align:start position:0%

i just want to make sure representing
 
02:10:34.069 --> 02:10:34.079 align:start position:0%
fenton got a chance at the mic again i'm
 
02:10:35.750 --> 02:10:35.760 align:start position:0%

02:10:37.669 --> 02:10:37.679 align:start position:0%
question thank you
 
02:10:39.589 --> 02:10:39.599 align:start position:0%
okay any further questions for
 
02:10:42.390 --> 02:10:42.400 align:start position:0%
representative mullen
 
02:10:43.990 --> 02:10:44.000 align:start position:0%
represent hobson
 
02:10:45.910 --> 02:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
sorry just one quick question and thank
 
02:10:48.149 --> 02:10:48.159 align:start position:0%
you um did you do you have a copy of
 
02:10:49.510 --> 02:10:49.520 align:start position:0%
that um
 
02:10:53.189 --> 02:10:53.199 align:start position:0%
list of offenses here i do is it extra
 
02:11:02.310 --> 02:11:02.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:03.990 --> 02:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
further further questions for
 
02:11:06.550 --> 02:11:06.560 align:start position:0%
representative mullin
 
02:11:09.990 --> 02:11:10.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much you're quite welcome
 
02:11:12.310 --> 02:11:12.320 align:start position:0%
are diana you also a
 
02:11:14.709 --> 02:11:14.719 align:start position:0%
information for this one too
 
02:11:17.030 --> 02:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
uh if the committee has any questions i
 
02:11:21.589 --> 02:11:21.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:24.550 --> 02:11:24.560 align:start position:0%
okay uh attorney uh
 
02:11:27.350 --> 02:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
fenton is here representing tanner
 
02:11:29.350 --> 02:11:29.360 align:start position:0%
thank you uh so i think you heard my
 
02:11:31.830 --> 02:11:31.840 align:start position:0%
question before but i'll restate it you
 
02:11:33.430 --> 02:11:33.440 align:start position:0%
said the nasdaq or
 
02:11:36.390 --> 02:11:36.400 align:start position:0%
close to nasdaq is a national national
 
02:11:40.069 --> 02:11:40.079 align:start position:0%
uh database for teachers
 
02:11:42.470 --> 02:11:42.480 align:start position:0%
i assume that mean credential teachers
 
02:11:44.950 --> 02:11:44.960 align:start position:0%
so i was wondering uh in charter schools
 
02:11:46.550 --> 02:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
where only 50 percent have to be
 
02:11:48.629 --> 02:11:48.639 align:start position:0%
credentialed but they are full-time
 
02:11:49.830 --> 02:11:49.840 align:start position:0%
teachers and they're working in the
 
02:11:52.229 --> 02:11:52.239 align:start position:0%
public school system
 
02:11:55.430 --> 02:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
would they then go in if they fail to
 
02:11:57.350 --> 02:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
meet the cri the
 
02:11:59.510 --> 02:11:59.520 align:start position:0%
criminal background checks do they go
 
02:12:02.069 --> 02:12:02.079 align:start position:0%
into that database
 
02:12:02.079 --> 02:12:02.790 align:start position:0%
into that database
so

02:12:02.790 --> 02:12:02.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:12:04.149 --> 02:12:04.159 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question for the
 
02:12:05.990 --> 02:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
record my name is diana fenton i'm an
 
02:12:07.030 --> 02:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
attorney with the department of
 
02:12:07.040 --> 02:12:08.629 align:start position:0%
attorney with the department of
education

02:12:08.629 --> 02:12:08.639 align:start position:0%
education
 
02:12:11.030 --> 02:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
a couple of things
 
02:12:13.109 --> 02:12:13.119 align:start position:0%
as it pertains to charter schools last
 
02:12:15.430 --> 02:12:15.440 align:start position:0%
session a bill was passed
 
02:12:17.669 --> 02:12:17.679 align:start position:0%
which made the code of conduct
 
02:12:20.390 --> 02:12:20.400 align:start position:0%
applicable to charter schools so we are
 
02:12:22.310 --> 02:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
working with charter schools on on that
 
02:12:23.669 --> 02:12:23.679 align:start position:0%
particular issue
 
02:12:25.910 --> 02:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
um i don't recall the number off the top
 
02:12:27.830 --> 02:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
of my head but it made the code of
 
02:12:29.750 --> 02:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
conduct applicable to charter schools as
 
02:12:32.149 --> 02:12:32.159 align:start position:0%
an entity recognizing that not everyone
 
02:12:33.910 --> 02:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
within a charter school employment wise
 
02:12:35.990 --> 02:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
is credentialed
 
02:12:39.510 --> 02:12:39.520 align:start position:0%
as far as nasdaq goes
 
02:12:41.750 --> 02:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
someone is only entered into nasdaq not
 
02:12:43.750 --> 02:12:43.760 align:start position:0%
because they pass a background check or
 
02:12:45.270 --> 02:12:45.280 align:start position:0%
they don't pass a background check
 
02:12:47.189 --> 02:12:47.199 align:start position:0%
they're entered into nasdaq if there's a
 
02:12:50.470 --> 02:12:50.480 align:start position:0%
finding of educator misconduct
 
02:12:50.480 --> 02:12:51.830 align:start position:0%
finding of educator misconduct
which

02:12:51.830 --> 02:12:51.840 align:start position:0%
which
 
02:12:54.149 --> 02:12:54.159 align:start position:0%
presumably other states would want to
 
02:12:56.390 --> 02:12:56.400 align:start position:0%
know about it it's not directly linked
 
02:13:00.790 --> 02:13:00.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:03.270 --> 02:13:03.280 align:start position:0%
when representative mueller said you
 
02:13:05.109 --> 02:13:05.119 align:start position:0%
played stump the representative i
 
02:13:06.870 --> 02:13:06.880 align:start position:0%
thought i think he played stump the
 
02:13:09.830 --> 02:13:09.840 align:start position:0%
lawyer too because
 
02:13:11.830 --> 02:13:11.840 align:start position:0%
our actions of the department of
 
02:13:13.910 --> 02:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
education are narrowly tailored to
 
02:13:16.149 --> 02:13:16.159 align:start position:0%
credential holders
 
02:13:17.350 --> 02:13:17.360 align:start position:0%
and so
 
02:13:19.669 --> 02:13:19.679 align:start position:0%
while part of me was inclined to say i
 
02:13:21.510 --> 02:13:21.520 align:start position:0%
think that individual could
 
02:13:23.510 --> 02:13:23.520 align:start position:0%
in theory presumably still be entered
 
02:13:26.229 --> 02:13:26.239 align:start position:0%
into nasdaq
 
02:13:28.069 --> 02:13:28.079 align:start position:0%
i will have to get back to you with that
 
02:13:31.350 --> 02:13:31.360 align:start position:0%
answer because if someone doesn't have a
 
02:13:31.360 --> 02:13:33.910 align:start position:0%
answer because if someone doesn't have a
credential

02:13:33.910 --> 02:13:33.920 align:start position:0%
credential
 
02:13:35.510 --> 02:13:35.520 align:start position:0%
the department doesn't have jurisdiction
 
02:13:36.629 --> 02:13:36.639 align:start position:0%
over them and we've had this
 
02:13:38.950 --> 02:13:38.960 align:start position:0%
conversation with districts as we
 
02:13:38.960 --> 02:13:40.470 align:start position:0%
conversation with districts as we
receive

02:13:40.470 --> 02:13:40.480 align:start position:0%
receive
 
02:13:40.480 --> 02:13:41.510 align:start position:0%
receive
calls

02:13:41.510 --> 02:13:41.520 align:start position:0%
calls
 
02:13:43.270 --> 02:13:43.280 align:start position:0%
with allegations of violations of the
 
02:13:46.229 --> 02:13:46.239 align:start position:0%
code of conduct it's part of our inquiry
 
02:13:49.510 --> 02:13:49.520 align:start position:0%
and vetting out cases so for example we
 
02:13:51.669 --> 02:13:51.679 align:start position:0%
deal with para educators some para
 
02:13:53.830 --> 02:13:53.840 align:start position:0%
educators are credentialed some of them
 
02:13:55.990 --> 02:13:56.000 align:start position:0%
are not and so we will simply say is
 
02:13:59.270 --> 02:13:59.280 align:start position:0%
that person credentialed are they not um
 
02:14:01.990 --> 02:14:02.000 align:start position:0%
i cannot recall an instance in which we
 
02:14:04.229 --> 02:14:04.239 align:start position:0%
had someone
 
02:14:06.709 --> 02:14:06.719 align:start position:0%
not credentialed and we took action upon
 
02:14:08.870 --> 02:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
them because we can't
 
02:14:10.550 --> 02:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
uh so i'm not familiar with that
 
02:14:12.229 --> 02:14:12.239 align:start position:0%
particular fact pattern typically
 
02:14:13.830 --> 02:14:13.840 align:start position:0%
representative tanner we will find some
 
02:14:16.310 --> 02:14:16.320 align:start position:0%
kind of documentation in our eis system
 
02:14:18.790 --> 02:14:18.800 align:start position:0%
whether it's a statement of eligibility
 
02:14:21.189 --> 02:14:21.199 align:start position:0%
or something that will give us the
 
02:14:22.709 --> 02:14:22.719 align:start position:0%
department jurisdiction over that
 
02:14:24.229 --> 02:14:24.239 align:start position:0%
individual so
 
02:14:26.069 --> 02:14:26.079 align:start position:0%
you played stump the representative and
 
02:14:28.390 --> 02:14:28.400 align:start position:0%
won and you won at stump the lawyer as
 
02:14:30.629 --> 02:14:30.639 align:start position:0%
well so you're doing quite well and it's
 
02:14:32.709 --> 02:14:32.719 align:start position:0%
not even noon um i will have to get back
 
02:14:34.550 --> 02:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
to you on that uh
 
02:14:36.149 --> 02:14:36.159 align:start position:0%
representative fenton i i do have a
 
02:14:37.669 --> 02:14:37.679 align:start position:0%
question for him follow up to where i'm
 
02:14:39.350 --> 02:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
not a representative
 
02:14:41.669 --> 02:14:41.679 align:start position:0%
okay well we we've just upgraded your
 
02:14:45.189 --> 02:14:45.199 align:start position:0%
pay i'm fantastic i'll have to let frank
 
02:14:47.589 --> 02:14:47.599 align:start position:0%
know i don't know if he's ready so uh in
 
02:14:49.589 --> 02:14:49.599 align:start position:0%
the bill we just did
 
02:14:51.830 --> 02:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
that bill uh when we're dealing with
 
02:14:51.840 --> 02:14:53.189 align:start position:0%
that bill uh when we're dealing with
employment

02:14:53.189 --> 02:14:53.199 align:start position:0%
employment
 
02:14:55.589 --> 02:14:55.599 align:start position:0%
also reflected rsa
 
02:14:58.390 --> 02:14:58.400 align:start position:0%
633 colon 7.
 
02:15:02.310 --> 02:15:02.320 align:start position:0%
so this bill is adding 633 colon 7 so is
 
02:15:05.750 --> 02:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
it fair to say that that any employee
 
02:15:11.030 --> 02:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
is accountable to that rsa 633 colon 7.
 
02:15:14.390 --> 02:15:14.400 align:start position:0%
yes so last session human trafficking
 
02:15:17.910 --> 02:15:17.920 align:start position:0%
which is rsa 633 colon 7 that was added
 
02:15:21.109 --> 02:15:21.119 align:start position:0%
to the list of disqualifiers
 
02:15:23.270 --> 02:15:23.280 align:start position:0%
in the employment section
 
02:15:25.350 --> 02:15:25.360 align:start position:0%
because we were in the process
 
02:15:29.350 --> 02:15:29.360 align:start position:0%
legislatively of creating 189 13c
 
02:15:32.069 --> 02:15:32.079 align:start position:0%
and because of that this this before you
 
02:15:33.589 --> 02:15:33.599 align:start position:0%
didn't exist
 
02:15:33.599 --> 02:15:34.790 align:start position:0%
didn't exist
for

02:15:34.790 --> 02:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:15:36.709 --> 02:15:36.719 align:start position:0%
for us to add the human trafficking
 
02:15:38.950 --> 02:15:38.960 align:start position:0%
offense and so this really is a cleanup
 
02:15:41.270 --> 02:15:41.280 align:start position:0%
bill we want to recognize the importance
 
02:15:43.189 --> 02:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
of having consistency
 
02:15:46.229 --> 02:15:46.239 align:start position:0%
in the disqualifiers whether it be in
 
02:15:48.629 --> 02:15:48.639 align:start position:0%
employment or in credentialing there has
 
02:15:50.790 --> 02:15:50.800 align:start position:0%
to be that consistency there cannot be
 
02:15:53.270 --> 02:15:53.280 align:start position:0%
discrepancy between the two lists and
 
02:15:54.709 --> 02:15:54.719 align:start position:0%
it's interesting to share with this
 
02:15:54.719 --> 02:15:56.310 align:start position:0%
it's interesting to share with this
committee

02:15:56.310 --> 02:15:56.320 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:15:56.320 --> 02:15:57.109 align:start position:0%
committee
that

02:15:57.109 --> 02:15:57.119 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:16:00.149 --> 02:16:00.159 align:start position:0%
there was a gentleman an educator
 
02:16:02.310 --> 02:16:02.320 align:start position:0%
it was in the press he
 
02:16:06.390 --> 02:16:06.400 align:start position:0%
pled guilty back in september of 2021 of
 
02:16:09.189 --> 02:16:09.199 align:start position:0%
last year he pled guilty to human
 
02:16:09.199 --> 02:16:10.870 align:start position:0%
last year he pled guilty to human
trafficking

02:16:10.870 --> 02:16:10.880 align:start position:0%
trafficking
 
02:16:12.310 --> 02:16:12.320 align:start position:0%
right here in merrimack county he pled
 
02:16:15.350 --> 02:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
guilty to human trafficking and i heard
 
02:16:17.350 --> 02:16:17.360 align:start position:0%
that on wmur where everyone in new
 
02:16:19.270 --> 02:16:19.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire gets their news and i grabbed
 
02:16:21.750 --> 02:16:21.760 align:start position:0%
my phone and i looked up the effective
 
02:16:24.310 --> 02:16:24.320 align:start position:0%
date of representative mullen's bill and
 
02:16:26.870 --> 02:16:26.880 align:start position:0%
it had become effective signed into law
 
02:16:28.310 --> 02:16:28.320 align:start position:0%
the day before
 
02:16:30.870 --> 02:16:30.880 align:start position:0%
that gentleman pled guilty and so
 
02:16:32.629 --> 02:16:32.639 align:start position:0%
representative mullen was kind enough to
 
02:16:34.469 --> 02:16:34.479 align:start position:0%
take a phone call from me at 6 30 in the
 
02:16:36.549 --> 02:16:36.559 align:start position:0%
morning and she has never answered my
 
02:16:37.830 --> 02:16:37.840 align:start position:0%
calls since
 
02:16:40.549 --> 02:16:40.559 align:start position:0%
because i was so excited that all of a
 
02:16:42.389 --> 02:16:42.399 align:start position:0%
sudden we saw it all come together this
 
02:16:44.790 --> 02:16:44.800 align:start position:0%
gentleman will not teach in a new
 
02:16:46.549 --> 02:16:46.559 align:start position:0%
hampshire school because he pled guilty
 
02:16:48.870 --> 02:16:48.880 align:start position:0%
to uh the offense of human trafficking
 
02:16:50.469 --> 02:16:50.479 align:start position:0%
um and it
 
02:16:51.830 --> 02:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
i wanted to share that with this
 
02:16:53.190 --> 02:16:53.200 align:start position:0%
committee that it was this committee's
 
02:16:55.110 --> 02:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
work that that made that possible and
 
02:16:57.270 --> 02:16:57.280 align:start position:0%
recognize the importance of it um i
 
02:16:58.950 --> 02:16:58.960 align:start position:0%
think when we hear that offense of human
 
02:17:01.589 --> 02:17:01.599 align:start position:0%
trafficking we are inclined to say well
 
02:17:03.910 --> 02:17:03.920 align:start position:0%
that doesn't happen here in new
 
02:17:06.549 --> 02:17:06.559 align:start position:0%
hampshire um and sadly we recognize that
 
02:17:08.549 --> 02:17:08.559 align:start position:0%
it that it does and
 
02:17:09.830 --> 02:17:09.840 align:start position:0%
so really
 
02:17:12.309 --> 02:17:12.319 align:start position:0%
what this bill in front of you does
 
02:17:14.070 --> 02:17:14.080 align:start position:0%
is recognize the importance of that
 
02:17:16.389 --> 02:17:16.399 align:start position:0%
offense of human trafficking recognizing
 
02:17:17.990 --> 02:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
how dangerous that would be to have that
 
02:17:21.030 --> 02:17:21.040 align:start position:0%
in a classroom and more importantly
 
02:17:23.270 --> 02:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
while by putting it in this particular
 
02:17:26.629 --> 02:17:26.639 align:start position:0%
section 189 13 c
 
02:17:28.469 --> 02:17:28.479 align:start position:0%
we are telling people
 
02:17:30.870 --> 02:17:30.880 align:start position:0%
if you are applying for a credential in
 
02:17:32.389 --> 02:17:32.399 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire to teach
 
02:17:32.399 --> 02:17:33.990 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire to teach
children

02:17:33.990 --> 02:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
children
 
02:17:35.830 --> 02:17:35.840 align:start position:0%
you will not be licensed to teach if you
 
02:17:37.270 --> 02:17:37.280 align:start position:0%
have that offense on your criminal
 
02:17:37.280 --> 02:17:38.629 align:start position:0%
have that offense on your criminal
record

02:17:38.629 --> 02:17:38.639 align:start position:0%
record
 
02:17:40.309 --> 02:17:40.319 align:start position:0%
that's what this bill does represent
 
02:17:40.319 --> 02:17:42.309 align:start position:0%
that's what this bill does represent
cordelia

02:17:42.309 --> 02:17:42.319 align:start position:0%
cordelia
 
02:17:43.910 --> 02:17:43.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
02:17:45.910 --> 02:17:45.920 align:start position:0%
represent i mean attorney fenton
 
02:17:45.920 --> 02:17:47.110 align:start position:0%
represent i mean attorney fenton
um

02:17:47.110 --> 02:17:47.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:17:49.429 --> 02:17:49.439 align:start position:0%
why not add
 
02:17:51.270 --> 02:17:51.280 align:start position:0%
318 b
 
02:17:54.870 --> 02:17:54.880 align:start position:0%
to control substance intent to sell
 
02:17:58.309 --> 02:17:58.319 align:start position:0%
to the credentialing section as well
 
02:18:02.070 --> 02:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:03.990 --> 02:18:04.000 align:start position:0%
at this point this bill
 
02:18:05.750 --> 02:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
belongs to the committee so i will leave
 
02:18:08.070 --> 02:18:08.080 align:start position:0%
that in your discretion
 
02:18:10.230 --> 02:18:10.240 align:start position:0%
but i think it is important to recognize
 
02:18:12.870 --> 02:18:12.880 align:start position:0%
and not conflate the different sections
 
02:18:15.910 --> 02:18:15.920 align:start position:0%
um and if this committee were to pass
 
02:18:19.110 --> 02:18:19.120 align:start position:0%
the bill that it just heard 1311 then
 
02:18:21.509 --> 02:18:21.519 align:start position:0%
presumably we will be before you next
 
02:18:23.910 --> 02:18:23.920 align:start position:0%
session uh asking to add those into the
 
02:18:26.070 --> 02:18:26.080 align:start position:0%
other sections but as this bill now
 
02:18:27.429 --> 02:18:27.439 align:start position:0%
belongs to this committee that is
 
02:18:30.070 --> 02:18:30.080 align:start position:0%
certainly um
 
02:18:32.230 --> 02:18:32.240 align:start position:0%
amendment that you could take up
 
02:18:34.309 --> 02:18:34.319 align:start position:0%
but i appreciate the opportunity to
 
02:18:35.750 --> 02:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
explain some of the initiatives the
 
02:18:37.030 --> 02:18:37.040 align:start position:0%
department is undertaking in this
 
02:18:38.389 --> 02:18:38.399 align:start position:0%
important area
 
02:18:40.790 --> 02:18:40.800 align:start position:0%
thank you representative ford
 
02:18:43.190 --> 02:18:43.200 align:start position:0%
here mike you're mike thank you
 
02:18:43.200 --> 02:18:45.190 align:start position:0%
here mike you're mike thank you
mike

02:18:45.190 --> 02:18:45.200 align:start position:0%
mike
 
02:18:47.349 --> 02:18:47.359 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
02:18:49.830 --> 02:18:49.840 align:start position:0%
i'm sitting here puzzling
 
02:18:51.910 --> 02:18:51.920 align:start position:0%
a predicament that we had a number of
 
02:18:54.469 --> 02:18:54.479 align:start position:0%
years ago when i was an academic vice
 
02:18:54.479 --> 02:18:55.509 align:start position:0%
years ago when i was an academic vice
president

02:18:55.509 --> 02:18:55.519 align:start position:0%
president
 
02:18:58.230 --> 02:18:58.240 align:start position:0%
and we had large numbers of people
 
02:19:01.589 --> 02:19:01.599 align:start position:0%
graduating with degrees in education who
 
02:19:01.599 --> 02:19:02.469 align:start position:0%
graduating with degrees in education who
never

02:19:02.469 --> 02:19:02.479 align:start position:0%
never
 
02:19:02.479 --> 02:19:03.509 align:start position:0%
never
ever

02:19:03.509 --> 02:19:03.519 align:start position:0%
ever
 
02:19:06.389 --> 02:19:06.399 align:start position:0%
applied for a credential as a teacher
 
02:19:08.309 --> 02:19:08.319 align:start position:0%
and we were trying to figure out why are
 
02:19:10.709 --> 02:19:10.719 align:start position:0%
we training these people to be teachers
 
02:19:13.830 --> 02:19:13.840 align:start position:0%
when they have no intention of teaching
 
02:19:13.840 --> 02:19:14.870 align:start position:0%
when they have no intention of teaching
and

02:19:14.870 --> 02:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:19:16.709 --> 02:19:16.719 align:start position:0%
it turned out that there's a fair amount
 
02:19:19.589 --> 02:19:19.599 align:start position:0%
of demand in industry for people with
 
02:19:21.830 --> 02:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
that subset of credentials or
 
02:19:21.840 --> 02:19:23.669 align:start position:0%
that subset of credentials or
capabilities

02:19:23.669 --> 02:19:23.679 align:start position:0%
capabilities
 
02:19:25.990 --> 02:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
and then i move that back a step and
 
02:19:27.509 --> 02:19:27.519 align:start position:0%
we're talking about protecting the
 
02:19:30.150 --> 02:19:30.160 align:start position:0%
teachers but we don't do it only until
 
02:19:32.309 --> 02:19:32.319 align:start position:0%
they apply to be a teacher
 
02:19:34.389 --> 02:19:34.399 align:start position:0%
but before they become that
 
02:19:37.270 --> 02:19:37.280 align:start position:0%
they're in the schools
 
02:19:39.270 --> 02:19:39.280 align:start position:0%
and we have not done a background check
 
02:19:42.469 --> 02:19:42.479 align:start position:0%
on them and so my question simply given
 
02:19:45.910 --> 02:19:45.920 align:start position:0%
that factor out i just gave you is maybe
 
02:19:47.990 --> 02:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
we should consider or do you think we
 
02:19:50.550 --> 02:19:50.560 align:start position:0%
should consider
 
02:19:52.550 --> 02:19:52.560 align:start position:0%
doing the same background check with
 
02:19:54.389 --> 02:19:54.399 align:start position:0%
people who enroll in a teacher
 
02:19:56.230 --> 02:19:56.240 align:start position:0%
preparation program
 
02:19:58.630 --> 02:19:58.640 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for the question um
 
02:20:01.990 --> 02:20:02.000 align:start position:0%
so part of senate bill 134
 
02:20:03.910 --> 02:20:03.920 align:start position:0%
not only addressed first-time teaching
 
02:20:06.070 --> 02:20:06.080 align:start position:0%
applicants applying to the department of
 
02:20:07.910 --> 02:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
education but also
 
02:20:10.389 --> 02:20:10.399 align:start position:0%
addressed the issue of teacher prep
 
02:20:12.710 --> 02:20:12.720 align:start position:0%
program candidates
 
02:20:16.070 --> 02:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
we had a similar issue look at
 
02:20:18.870 --> 02:20:18.880 align:start position:0%
colleges such as saint anselm's they
 
02:20:20.870 --> 02:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
could not get that federal background
 
02:20:21.910 --> 02:20:21.920 align:start position:0%
check because they are a
 
02:20:24.630 --> 02:20:24.640 align:start position:0%
non-governmental entity and so
 
02:20:26.870 --> 02:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
the department of ed stepped in and we
 
02:20:29.750 --> 02:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
are working to take on that role whereby
 
02:20:31.429 --> 02:20:31.439 align:start position:0%
we work with
 
02:20:33.590 --> 02:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
the institutes of higher education those
 
02:20:36.150 --> 02:20:36.160 align:start position:0%
teacher prep programs and we will do
 
02:20:39.590 --> 02:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
similar to the bus drivers a clearance
 
02:20:42.150 --> 02:20:42.160 align:start position:0%
for those individuals to go into various
 
02:20:42.160 --> 02:20:43.670 align:start position:0%
for those individuals to go into various
districts

02:20:43.670 --> 02:20:43.680 align:start position:0%
districts
 
02:20:45.110 --> 02:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
you know i think it's important to
 
02:20:47.670 --> 02:20:47.680 align:start position:0%
recognize that the individual districts
 
02:20:49.349 --> 02:20:49.359 align:start position:0%
still have the right to do their own
 
02:20:51.830 --> 02:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
background check
 
02:20:54.070 --> 02:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
they are allowing people into their
 
02:20:56.070 --> 02:20:56.080 align:start position:0%
schools to be around their children and
 
02:20:58.389 --> 02:20:58.399 align:start position:0%
they have the liability they have the
 
02:20:59.990 --> 02:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity to do that but that is a
 
02:21:01.910 --> 02:21:01.920 align:start position:0%
role that the department is currently
 
02:21:04.550 --> 02:21:04.560 align:start position:0%
working to take on um so i really
 
02:21:05.990 --> 02:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
appreciate that question because it is
 
02:21:08.630 --> 02:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
an area of concern and we did recognize
 
02:21:10.469 --> 02:21:10.479 align:start position:0%
that last session and take steps to
 
02:21:12.630 --> 02:21:12.640 align:start position:0%
address it the best we could thank you
 
02:21:16.469 --> 02:21:16.479 align:start position:0%
thank you representative uh
 
02:21:18.950 --> 02:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
you will keep promoting me i'm gonna get
 
02:21:20.790 --> 02:21:20.800 align:start position:0%
a call from you i'm gonna get you a rank
 
02:21:22.710 --> 02:21:22.720 align:start position:0%
really fast
 
02:21:22.720 --> 02:21:23.510 align:start position:0%
really fast
yeah

02:21:23.510 --> 02:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:21:25.910 --> 02:21:25.920 align:start position:0%
yeah um i thought we addressed that when
 
02:21:27.670 --> 02:21:27.680 align:start position:0%
we talked about the student student
 
02:21:27.680 --> 02:21:28.790 align:start position:0%
we talked about the student student
teachers

02:21:28.790 --> 02:21:28.800 align:start position:0%
teachers
 
02:21:31.030 --> 02:21:31.040 align:start position:0%
uh and the fees that they had to pay for
 
02:21:34.950 --> 02:21:34.960 align:start position:0%
this before they got into the classroom
 
02:21:37.429 --> 02:21:37.439 align:start position:0%
so one of the considerations was the
 
02:21:38.950 --> 02:21:38.960 align:start position:0%
nature of the fees what what was
 
02:21:40.469 --> 02:21:40.479 align:start position:0%
happening in the field
 
02:21:43.429 --> 02:21:43.439 align:start position:0%
is if i was a teacher prep program
 
02:21:43.439 --> 02:21:44.710 align:start position:0%
is if i was a teacher prep program
candidate

02:21:44.710 --> 02:21:44.720 align:start position:0%
candidate
 
02:21:46.870 --> 02:21:46.880 align:start position:0%
at a college
 
02:21:46.880 --> 02:21:48.469 align:start position:0%
at a college
i

02:21:48.469 --> 02:21:48.479 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:21:51.349 --> 02:21:51.359 align:start position:0%
could in theory be paying multiple
 
02:21:53.110 --> 02:21:53.120 align:start position:0%
fees and multiple instances to get my
 
02:21:54.469 --> 02:21:54.479 align:start position:0%
background check
 
02:21:56.150 --> 02:21:56.160 align:start position:0%
to go into these various schools and it
 
02:21:58.630 --> 02:21:58.640 align:start position:0%
was just simply becoming untenable and
 
02:22:01.030 --> 02:22:01.040 align:start position:0%
so the thought was if we could kind of
 
02:22:04.230 --> 02:22:04.240 align:start position:0%
house it in a central location right
 
02:22:06.389 --> 02:22:06.399 align:start position:0%
utilize the department of education to
 
02:22:08.950 --> 02:22:08.960 align:start position:0%
serve that important role to facilitate
 
02:22:08.960 --> 02:22:10.389 align:start position:0%
serve that important role to facilitate
this

02:22:10.389 --> 02:22:10.399 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:22:15.349 --> 02:22:15.359 align:start position:0%
then it could in theory be a one-time
 
02:22:18.309 --> 02:22:18.319 align:start position:0%
background check one-time costs and fee
 
02:22:21.590 --> 02:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
however we do have to recognize that
 
02:22:25.270 --> 02:22:25.280 align:start position:0%
districts will always retain the right
 
02:22:27.270 --> 02:22:27.280 align:start position:0%
to do those additional background checks
 
02:22:29.429 --> 02:22:29.439 align:start position:0%
and they have every right to do that
 
02:22:31.750 --> 02:22:31.760 align:start position:0%
and recognize the the safety issue there
 
02:22:34.870 --> 02:22:34.880 align:start position:0%
so does it completely solve the problem
 
02:22:37.190 --> 02:22:37.200 align:start position:0%
i can't say that it does but is it
 
02:22:39.270 --> 02:22:39.280 align:start position:0%
another avenue by which the department
 
02:22:40.950 --> 02:22:40.960 align:start position:0%
is trying to address these issues
 
02:22:42.870 --> 02:22:42.880 align:start position:0%
identify these issues and address them
 
02:22:44.230 --> 02:22:44.240 align:start position:0%
by working with our partners in the
 
02:22:46.630 --> 02:22:46.640 align:start position:0%
field absolutely thank you
 
02:22:48.070 --> 02:22:48.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:22:48.080 --> 02:22:51.429 align:start position:0%
thank you
representatives

02:22:51.429 --> 02:22:51.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:53.429 --> 02:22:53.439 align:start position:0%
thank you i just have a quick question
 
02:22:55.349 --> 02:22:55.359 align:start position:0%
and that is how long do these fbi
 
02:22:57.590 --> 02:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
background checks take because you know
 
02:22:59.030 --> 02:22:59.040 align:start position:0%
if you've got a student teacher and they
 
02:23:00.389 --> 02:23:00.399 align:start position:0%
take a month or two to do them and
 
02:23:02.230 --> 02:23:02.240 align:start position:0%
they're trying to do it on a term it
 
02:23:03.590 --> 02:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
could mean they effectively can't go in
 
02:23:06.070 --> 02:23:06.080 align:start position:0%
the classroom that term
 
02:23:06.080 --> 02:23:06.950 align:start position:0%
the classroom that term
so

02:23:06.950 --> 02:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:23:09.030 --> 02:23:09.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
02:23:12.630 --> 02:23:12.640 align:start position:0%
it my hesitation is only because i
 
02:23:14.309 --> 02:23:14.319 align:start position:0%
do not work for the department of safety
 
02:23:16.950 --> 02:23:16.960 align:start position:0%
and i hesitate to speak on their behalf
 
02:23:18.389 --> 02:23:18.399 align:start position:0%
but i can tell you that the department
 
02:23:20.950 --> 02:23:20.960 align:start position:0%
of safety has taken a lot of
 
02:23:23.670 --> 02:23:23.680 align:start position:0%
initiatives to speed up the process of
 
02:23:24.950 --> 02:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
the background check and i think that
 
02:23:27.349 --> 02:23:27.359 align:start position:0%
was pretty common across the board is
 
02:23:29.190 --> 02:23:29.200 align:start position:0%
the delay
 
02:23:31.349 --> 02:23:31.359 align:start position:0%
but again the department of safety has
 
02:23:33.270 --> 02:23:33.280 align:start position:0%
tried to address that issue pretty
 
02:23:35.429 --> 02:23:35.439 align:start position:0%
quickly i think a month turnaround would
 
02:23:37.590 --> 02:23:37.600 align:start position:0%
be surprisingly long
 
02:23:39.030 --> 02:23:39.040 align:start position:0%
and i think the background check
 
02:23:40.630 --> 02:23:40.640 align:start position:0%
turnaround is now
 
02:23:43.030 --> 02:23:43.040 align:start position:0%
within a week but again i'm going to
 
02:23:44.950 --> 02:23:44.960 align:start position:0%
couch that by saying i do not work for
 
02:23:46.469 --> 02:23:46.479 align:start position:0%
the department of safety
 
02:23:47.910 --> 02:23:47.920 align:start position:0%
so i have to be careful in in that
 
02:23:49.830 --> 02:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
testimony but i can say that they are
 
02:23:51.270 --> 02:23:51.280 align:start position:0%
aware of that issue that issue's been
 
02:23:53.349 --> 02:23:53.359 align:start position:0%
brought to their attention and we at the
 
02:23:56.230 --> 02:23:56.240 align:start position:0%
department of ed have worked very um
 
02:23:57.750 --> 02:23:57.760 align:start position:0%
very closely with our partners at the
 
02:23:58.950 --> 02:23:58.960 align:start position:0%
department of safety and they've worked
 
02:24:00.550 --> 02:24:00.560 align:start position:0%
with the education field to address
 
02:24:03.270 --> 02:24:03.280 align:start position:0%
those concerns
 
02:24:05.270 --> 02:24:05.280 align:start position:0%
represented tanner
 
02:24:06.790 --> 02:24:06.800 align:start position:0%
no i know you're going to hate this
 
02:24:06.800 --> 02:24:08.150 align:start position:0%
no i know you're going to hate this
question

02:24:08.150 --> 02:24:08.160 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:24:11.270 --> 02:24:11.280 align:start position:0%
well you already stumped the lawyer once
 
02:24:11.280 --> 02:24:12.550 align:start position:0%
well you already stumped the lawyer once
so

02:24:12.550 --> 02:24:12.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:24:14.870 --> 02:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
again with charter schools they they
 
02:24:16.790 --> 02:24:16.800 align:start position:0%
don't have a superintendent that this
 
02:24:18.870 --> 02:24:18.880 align:start position:0%
the governmental setup isn't the same as
 
02:24:21.429 --> 02:24:21.439 align:start position:0%
districts so do they have the discretion
 
02:24:22.870 --> 02:24:22.880 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
02:24:22.880 --> 02:24:23.670 align:start position:0%
to uh
run

02:24:23.670 --> 02:24:23.680 align:start position:0%
run
 
02:24:23.680 --> 02:24:24.790 align:start position:0%
run
background

02:24:24.790 --> 02:24:24.800 align:start position:0%
background
 
02:24:31.110 --> 02:24:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:34.150 --> 02:24:34.160 align:start position:0%
so the difference in the structure at a
 
02:24:36.550 --> 02:24:36.560 align:start position:0%
charter school is recognized within the
 
02:24:39.349 --> 02:24:39.359 align:start position:0%
statute 189-13a
 
02:24:41.670 --> 02:24:41.680 align:start position:0%
and they they say the chief executive
 
02:24:45.429 --> 02:24:45.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:48.070 --> 02:24:48.080 align:start position:0%
so in terms of the discretion whether or
 
02:24:50.309 --> 02:24:50.319 align:start position:0%
not to run a background check
 
02:24:52.150 --> 02:24:52.160 align:start position:0%
i don't believe there is any discretion
 
02:24:55.830 --> 02:24:55.840 align:start position:0%
when i look at the statute 189 13a as it
 
02:24:57.990 --> 02:24:58.000 align:start position:0%
applies to charter schools and public
 
02:24:58.000 --> 02:24:59.590 align:start position:0%
applies to charter schools and public
schools

02:24:59.590 --> 02:24:59.600 align:start position:0%
schools
 
02:25:02.070 --> 02:25:02.080 align:start position:0%
in my reading of the statute the law is
 
02:25:04.950 --> 02:25:04.960 align:start position:0%
very clear that it applies
 
02:25:07.110 --> 02:25:07.120 align:start position:0%
regardless of the credential
 
02:25:08.389 --> 02:25:08.399 align:start position:0%
whether there's a credential or there's
 
02:25:08.399 --> 02:25:09.190 align:start position:0%
whether there's a credential or there's
not

02:25:09.190 --> 02:25:09.200 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:25:11.830 --> 02:25:11.840 align:start position:0%
it applies to equally to charter schools
 
02:25:13.590 --> 02:25:13.600 align:start position:0%
um just so they're considered a
 
02:25:15.270 --> 02:25:15.280 align:start position:0%
governmental agency like the
 
02:25:17.110 --> 02:25:17.120 align:start position:0%
superintendent is i mean that that was
 
02:25:18.150 --> 02:25:18.160 align:start position:0%
one of the
 
02:25:19.990 --> 02:25:20.000 align:start position:0%
little glitches when we were working
 
02:25:22.870 --> 02:25:22.880 align:start position:0%
with it before that um you know certain
 
02:25:25.510 --> 02:25:25.520 align:start position:0%
groups couldn't couldn't run the checks
 
02:25:27.349 --> 02:25:27.359 align:start position:0%
so the certain groups that can't run the
 
02:25:29.510 --> 02:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
checks we've identified as being like a
 
02:25:31.510 --> 02:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
private bus company things of that
 
02:25:34.550 --> 02:25:34.560 align:start position:0%
nature i am not aware of any charter
 
02:25:35.990 --> 02:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
school having an issue getting those
 
02:25:38.870 --> 02:25:38.880 align:start position:0%
background checks and and something like
 
02:25:38.880 --> 02:25:39.910 align:start position:0%
background checks and and something like
prenda

02:25:39.910 --> 02:25:39.920 align:start position:0%
prenda
 
02:25:42.950 --> 02:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
uh with the pods uh are they able to run
 
02:25:45.190 --> 02:25:45.200 align:start position:0%
background checks my understanding is
 
02:25:46.550 --> 02:25:46.560 align:start position:0%
they are we've actually worked very
 
02:25:48.230 --> 02:25:48.240 align:start position:0%
closely with prenda and the department
 
02:25:50.150 --> 02:25:50.160 align:start position:0%
of safety we had some um
 
02:25:54.150 --> 02:25:54.160 align:start position:0%
meetings with uh dos and prenda this
 
02:25:56.389 --> 02:25:56.399 align:start position:0%
past summer um i participated in those
 
02:25:58.150 --> 02:25:58.160 align:start position:0%
meetings where we addressed those those
 
02:26:00.309 --> 02:26:00.319 align:start position:0%
areas so um
 
02:26:01.910 --> 02:26:01.920 align:start position:0%
yeah we were able to address those
 
02:26:04.469 --> 02:26:04.479 align:start position:0%
concerns okay thank you thank you
 
02:26:05.910 --> 02:26:05.920 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there further
 
02:26:09.590 --> 02:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
questions of attorney fenton
 
02:26:11.590 --> 02:26:11.600 align:start position:0%
you downgraded me well we'll upgrade you
 
02:26:15.429 --> 02:26:15.439 align:start position:0%

from the so i see none and i have no
 
02:26:31.349 --> 02:26:31.359 align:start position:0%
further pink cards on this so we will
 
02:26:36.309 --> 02:26:36.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:39.349 --> 02:26:39.359 align:start position:0%
yeah and uh the next hearing starts in a
 
02:26:42.870 --> 02:26:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:44.710 --> 02:26:44.720 align:start position:0%
relative to requirements for teacher
 
02:26:56.870 --> 02:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:56.880 --> 02:26:57.830 align:start position:0%
 
uh

02:26:57.830 --> 02:26:57.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:26:59.990 --> 02:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
no we really don't we have about three
 
02:27:09.830 --> 02:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:26.230 --> 02:27:26.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:26.240 --> 02:27:37.590 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:27:37.590 --> 02:27:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:53.750 --> 02:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:53.760 --> 02:27:54.630 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:27:54.630 --> 02:27:54.640 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:28:01.270 --> 02:28:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:03.270 --> 02:28:03.280 align:start position:0%
what day is tomorrow oh it's only
 
02:28:07.910 --> 02:28:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:10.550 --> 02:28:10.560 align:start position:0%
there's a lot going on

i'm only scratching
 
02:29:05.280 --> 02:29:06.230 align:start position:0%
i'm only scratching
who's

who's
 
02:29:10.550 --> 02:29:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:11.910 --> 02:29:11.920 align:start position:0%
when you look at
 
02:29:13.990 --> 02:29:14.000 align:start position:0%
part a there which deals with employment
 
02:29:17.030 --> 02:29:17.040 align:start position:0%
the teachers all employed public schools
 
02:29:18.710 --> 02:29:18.720 align:start position:0%
charters are public
 
02:30:44.309 --> 02:30:44.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:46.230 --> 02:30:46.240 align:start position:0%
okay we're going to go ahead now it is
 
02:30:48.990 --> 02:30:49.000 align:start position:0%
11 30. we're going ahead with
 
02:30:49.000 --> 02:30:50.630 align:start position:0%
11 30. we're going ahead with
13.72

02:30:50.630 --> 02:30:50.640 align:start position:0%
13.72
 
02:30:52.469 --> 02:30:52.479 align:start position:0%
this is relative to the requirements for
 
02:30:54.469 --> 02:30:54.479 align:start position:0%
teacher certification
 
02:30:54.479 --> 02:30:56.550 align:start position:0%
teacher certification
and

02:30:56.550 --> 02:30:56.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:30:58.950 --> 02:30:58.960 align:start position:0%
do we have the
 
02:31:01.590 --> 02:31:01.600 align:start position:0%
okay representation is the prime sponsor
 
02:31:15.190 --> 02:31:15.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:17.349 --> 02:31:17.359 align:start position:0%
when you have an opportunity you know
 
02:31:18.710 --> 02:31:18.720 align:start position:0%
we'd like to get one of these filled out
 
02:31:21.510 --> 02:31:21.520 align:start position:0%
but you can do it when you're done okay
 
02:31:23.670 --> 02:31:23.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
02:31:25.670 --> 02:31:25.680 align:start position:0%

genigean representing rockingham
 
02:31:31.910 --> 02:31:31.920 align:start position:0%
district 8 which is salem
 
02:31:35.670 --> 02:31:35.680 align:start position:0%
today's today's bill 1372 relatively
 
02:31:35.680 --> 02:31:38.070 align:start position:0%
today's today's bill 1372 relatively
straightforward

02:31:38.070 --> 02:31:38.080 align:start position:0%
straightforward
 
02:31:39.990 --> 02:31:40.000 align:start position:0%
relative to requirements for teacher
 
02:31:40.000 --> 02:31:41.670 align:start position:0%
relative to requirements for teacher
certification

02:31:41.670 --> 02:31:41.680 align:start position:0%
certification
 
02:31:43.750 --> 02:31:43.760 align:start position:0%
one of the things that's
 
02:31:45.030 --> 02:31:45.040 align:start position:0%
been found
 
02:31:47.349 --> 02:31:47.359 align:start position:0%
to be true is a lot of newer teachers
 
02:31:47.359 --> 02:31:48.950 align:start position:0%
to be true is a lot of newer teachers
especially

02:31:48.950 --> 02:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
especially
 
02:31:51.110 --> 02:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
don't seem to be up on the education
 
02:31:51.120 --> 02:31:52.230 align:start position:0%
don't seem to be up on the education
rules

02:31:52.230 --> 02:31:52.240 align:start position:0%
rules
 
02:31:52.240 --> 02:31:53.110 align:start position:0%
rules
and

02:31:53.110 --> 02:31:53.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:31:55.030 --> 02:31:55.040 align:start position:0%
as i'm sure all you know
 
02:31:57.270 --> 02:31:57.280 align:start position:0%
education rules are are pretty critical
 
02:32:00.389 --> 02:32:00.399 align:start position:0%
for teachers to understand as they deal
 
02:32:02.710 --> 02:32:02.720 align:start position:0%
with such things as minimum education
 
02:32:06.150 --> 02:32:06.160 align:start position:0%
standards and a whole myriad of other
 
02:32:08.469 --> 02:32:08.479 align:start position:0%
items that that
 
02:32:11.429 --> 02:32:11.439 align:start position:0%
relate to education of students and and
 
02:32:12.469 --> 02:32:12.479 align:start position:0%
other things
 
02:32:12.479 --> 02:32:13.510 align:start position:0%
other things
um

02:32:13.510 --> 02:32:13.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:32:15.429 --> 02:32:15.439 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to say a whole lot about
 
02:32:17.670 --> 02:32:17.680 align:start position:0%
this um stephen
 
02:32:20.630 --> 02:32:20.640 align:start position:0%
uh steve appleby the director of um
 
02:32:22.469 --> 02:32:22.479 align:start position:0%
the division of education standards and
 
02:32:24.309 --> 02:32:24.319 align:start position:0%
higher ed we'll
 
02:32:27.030 --> 02:32:27.040 align:start position:0%
we'll be speaking to you as well
 
02:32:28.950 --> 02:32:28.960 align:start position:0%
and he mentioned to me yesterday i think
 
02:32:30.870 --> 02:32:30.880 align:start position:0%
he'll talk about this as well at the end
 
02:32:34.070 --> 02:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
of the bill where it says that
 
02:32:36.230 --> 02:32:36.240 align:start position:0%
this will take effect 60 days after
 
02:32:36.240 --> 02:32:38.469 align:start position:0%
this will take effect 60 days after
passage

02:32:38.469 --> 02:32:38.479 align:start position:0%
passage
 
02:32:40.230 --> 02:32:40.240 align:start position:0%
he told me yesterday that's that's a bit
 
02:32:42.150 --> 02:32:42.160 align:start position:0%
early and he'll be talking to that
 
02:32:43.750 --> 02:32:43.760 align:start position:0%
looking at probably more like a january
 
02:32:43.760 --> 02:32:45.110 align:start position:0%
looking at probably more like a january
1st

02:32:45.110 --> 02:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
1st
 
02:32:47.349 --> 02:32:47.359 align:start position:0%
implementation of that but this this
 
02:32:49.349 --> 02:32:49.359 align:start position:0%
bill basically would require
 
02:32:51.110 --> 02:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
that teachers
 
02:32:53.429 --> 02:32:53.439 align:start position:0%
or educators i should say
 
02:32:56.070 --> 02:32:56.080 align:start position:0%
to be certified need to take a course in
 
02:32:56.080 --> 02:32:57.510 align:start position:0%
to be certified need to take a course in
education

02:32:57.510 --> 02:32:57.520 align:start position:0%
education
 
02:32:59.590 --> 02:32:59.600 align:start position:0%
in the education rules so they're up on
 
02:33:01.670 --> 02:33:01.680 align:start position:0%
those things other than that mr chairman
 
02:33:03.670 --> 02:33:03.680 align:start position:0%
that's all i have to say if anyone has
 
02:33:05.510 --> 02:33:05.520 align:start position:0%
any questions thank you very much
 
02:33:07.270 --> 02:33:07.280 align:start position:0%
representative are there questions for
 
02:33:09.110 --> 02:33:09.120 align:start position:0%
the sponsor of the bill yes
 
02:33:11.030 --> 02:33:11.040 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli thank you thank
 
02:33:13.670 --> 02:33:13.680 align:start position:0%
you representative for uh being here
 
02:33:13.680 --> 02:33:15.030 align:start position:0%
you representative for uh being here
um

02:33:15.030 --> 02:33:15.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:33:15.040 --> 02:33:16.630 align:start position:0%
um
rules

02:33:16.630 --> 02:33:16.640 align:start position:0%
rules
 
02:33:18.070 --> 02:33:18.080 align:start position:0%
to be
 
02:33:20.630 --> 02:33:20.640 align:start position:0%
made a part of the process how about the
 
02:33:25.270 --> 02:33:25.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:27.429 --> 02:33:27.439 align:start position:0%
the certainly it's important for them
 
02:33:30.550 --> 02:33:30.560 align:start position:0%
for them to know the statutes as well um
 
02:33:33.030 --> 02:33:33.040 align:start position:0%
if this i'm certainly open to this bill
 
02:33:35.590 --> 02:33:35.600 align:start position:0%
being modified in in
 
02:33:37.510 --> 02:33:37.520 align:start position:0%
some way which would we certainly want
 
02:33:39.510 --> 02:33:39.520 align:start position:0%
teachers to have a comprehensive
 
02:33:39.520 --> 02:33:41.030 align:start position:0%
teachers to have a comprehensive
understanding

02:33:41.030 --> 02:33:41.040 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
02:33:41.040 --> 02:33:42.070 align:start position:0%
understanding
of

02:33:42.070 --> 02:33:42.080 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:33:45.429 --> 02:33:45.439 align:start position:0%
the laws as well as the rules
 
02:33:47.990 --> 02:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
uh represent i have a question for you
 
02:33:50.389 --> 02:33:50.399 align:start position:0%
um i'm holding up one set of rules right
 
02:33:52.469 --> 02:33:52.479 align:start position:0%
here minimum standards for public school
 
02:33:52.479 --> 02:33:53.590 align:start position:0%
here minimum standards for public school
approval

02:33:53.590 --> 02:33:53.600 align:start position:0%
approval
 
02:33:56.070 --> 02:33:56.080 align:start position:0%
these are rules we have rules for
 
02:33:58.710 --> 02:33:58.720 align:start position:0%
transportation we have rules for
 
02:34:00.710 --> 02:34:00.720 align:start position:0%
career technical education we have rules
 
02:34:00.720 --> 02:34:01.590 align:start position:0%
career technical education we have rules
for

02:34:01.590 --> 02:34:01.600 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:34:03.830 --> 02:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
just about anything a school does
 
02:34:06.389 --> 02:34:06.399 align:start position:0%
and so we'll be talking about another
 
02:34:08.389 --> 02:34:08.399 align:start position:0%
book that's the size of our statutory
 
02:34:08.399 --> 02:34:09.990 align:start position:0%
book that's the size of our statutory
language

02:34:09.990 --> 02:34:10.000 align:start position:0%
language
 
02:34:11.030 --> 02:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
right there
 
02:34:11.040 --> 02:34:12.469 align:start position:0%
right there
um

02:34:12.469 --> 02:34:12.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:34:15.190 --> 02:34:15.200 align:start position:0%
how is it possible for
 
02:34:15.200 --> 02:34:17.110 align:start position:0%
how is it possible for
uh

02:34:17.110 --> 02:34:17.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:34:19.830 --> 02:34:19.840 align:start position:0%
for a teacher like myself
 
02:34:23.030 --> 02:34:23.040 align:start position:0%
to and why is it important
 
02:34:25.349 --> 02:34:25.359 align:start position:0%
that i have to know about
 
02:34:25.359 --> 02:34:26.790 align:start position:0%
that i have to know about
transportation

02:34:26.790 --> 02:34:26.800 align:start position:0%
transportation
 
02:34:29.110 --> 02:34:29.120 align:start position:0%
or some topic which is not
 
02:34:31.349 --> 02:34:31.359 align:start position:0%
relevant to the instruction curriculum
 
02:34:32.950 --> 02:34:32.960 align:start position:0%
and working with parents in the
 
02:34:36.469 --> 02:34:36.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:39.670 --> 02:34:39.680 align:start position:0%
well that's uh certainly a good question
 
02:34:41.030 --> 02:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
i think
 
02:34:43.349 --> 02:34:43.359 align:start position:0%
as we look at
 
02:34:45.270 --> 02:34:45.280 align:start position:0%
you know teachers starting off uh
 
02:34:47.110 --> 02:34:47.120 align:start position:0%
teaching kids that's probably not that
 
02:34:49.910 --> 02:34:49.920 align:start position:0%
important however many teachers
 
02:34:51.429 --> 02:34:51.439 align:start position:0%
will eventual or some teachers will
 
02:34:54.150 --> 02:34:54.160 align:start position:0%
eventually move up to higher positions
 
02:34:55.590 --> 02:34:55.600 align:start position:0%
whether it's
 
02:34:59.670 --> 02:34:59.680 align:start position:0%
superintendent of schools or
 
02:35:02.309 --> 02:35:02.319 align:start position:0%
department chairs or whatever it is and
 
02:35:04.150 --> 02:35:04.160 align:start position:0%
may you know maybe there's you raise a
 
02:35:06.230 --> 02:35:06.240 align:start position:0%
good point maybe there's maybe there's
 
02:35:07.670 --> 02:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
there needs to be some more language
 
02:35:09.670 --> 02:35:09.680 align:start position:0%
here but i think
 
02:35:11.670 --> 02:35:11.680 align:start position:0%
it certainly is important for some of
 
02:35:13.429 --> 02:35:13.439 align:start position:0%
those who move on
 
02:35:16.389 --> 02:35:16.399 align:start position:0%
to higher positions to understand those
 
02:35:17.750 --> 02:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:35:19.590 --> 02:35:19.600 align:start position:0%
representative cornell
 
02:35:21.030 --> 02:35:21.040 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
02:35:23.910 --> 02:35:23.920 align:start position:0%
question as chairman ladd said this is
 
02:35:27.590 --> 02:35:27.600 align:start position:0%
what is now in law and this is from 2021
 
02:35:29.590 --> 02:35:29.600 align:start position:0%
we as a committee have not gotten our
 
02:35:31.910 --> 02:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
copy of the the latest
 
02:35:34.230 --> 02:35:34.240 align:start position:0%
rules from last year so i'm wondering
 
02:35:36.150 --> 02:35:36.160 align:start position:0%
how you would find somebody to teach
 
02:35:38.830 --> 02:35:38.840 align:start position:0%
this that would have the most recent
 
02:35:41.270 --> 02:35:41.280 align:start position:0%
laws and
 
02:35:43.750 --> 02:35:43.760 align:start position:0%
be able to do it its rules
 
02:35:48.150 --> 02:35:48.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:50.550 --> 02:35:50.560 align:start position:0%
um that's a good question i wasn't aware
 
02:35:51.750 --> 02:35:51.760 align:start position:0%
of that
 
02:35:52.830 --> 02:35:52.840 align:start position:0%
and and
 
02:35:54.870 --> 02:35:54.880 align:start position:0%
perhaps i don't want to put this on him
 
02:35:57.110 --> 02:35:57.120 align:start position:0%
but maybe when uh mr appleby is up here
 
02:35:58.070 --> 02:35:58.080 align:start position:0%
he can
 
02:36:00.950 --> 02:36:00.960 align:start position:0%
answer that question um but or maybe you
 
02:36:02.710 --> 02:36:02.720 align:start position:0%
know and i'd love to work with any
 
02:36:04.469 --> 02:36:04.479 align:start position:0%
member of the committee to
 
02:36:07.030 --> 02:36:07.040 align:start position:0%
to make this something that is doable
 
02:36:09.429 --> 02:36:09.439 align:start position:0%
because at the end of the day
 
02:36:12.469 --> 02:36:12.479 align:start position:0%
it is important some there are certain
 
02:36:14.389 --> 02:36:14.399 align:start position:0%
there's certainly much in the education
 
02:36:16.150 --> 02:36:16.160 align:start position:0%
rules that are critical for teachers to
 
02:36:16.160 --> 02:36:16.950 align:start position:0%
rules that are critical for teachers to
know

02:36:16.950 --> 02:36:16.960 align:start position:0%
know
 
02:36:19.110 --> 02:36:19.120 align:start position:0%
uh minimum education standards and
 
02:36:22.550 --> 02:36:22.560 align:start position:0%
things like that i mean it would be
 
02:36:24.870 --> 02:36:24.880 align:start position:0%
you know a travesty i think if if a
 
02:36:26.790 --> 02:36:26.800 align:start position:0%
teacher or an educator does not
 
02:36:29.429 --> 02:36:29.439 align:start position:0%
understand those things and is teaching
 
02:36:31.030 --> 02:36:31.040 align:start position:0%
and what is the point to having all
 
02:36:32.710 --> 02:36:32.720 align:start position:0%
these education rules if we're not going
 
02:36:34.389 --> 02:36:34.399 align:start position:0%
to follow them
 
02:36:36.309 --> 02:36:36.319 align:start position:0%
representative porter and then
 
02:36:38.309 --> 02:36:38.319 align:start position:0%
representative wolf thank you mr chair
 
02:36:40.150 --> 02:36:40.160 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question sir
 
02:36:42.309 --> 02:36:42.319 align:start position:0%
um do you know that these things aren't
 
02:36:44.790 --> 02:36:44.800 align:start position:0%
being taught now to prospective teachers
 
02:36:46.950 --> 02:36:46.960 align:start position:0%
in the classes um that they're taking
 
02:36:48.389 --> 02:36:48.399 align:start position:0%
for example
 
02:36:49.990 --> 02:36:50.000 align:start position:0%
if i'm training to be an elementary
 
02:36:52.469 --> 02:36:52.479 align:start position:0%
school teacher are you sure that the
 
02:36:54.070 --> 02:36:54.080 align:start position:0%
coursework that i'm taking does not
 
02:36:55.429 --> 02:36:55.439 align:start position:0%
include some of the rules that you
 
02:37:00.630 --> 02:37:00.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:02.950 --> 02:37:02.960 align:start position:0%
no i'm not sure but
 
02:37:07.110 --> 02:37:07.120 align:start position:0%
the it is not it's not a requirement so
 
02:37:09.349 --> 02:37:09.359 align:start position:0%
depending on the course itself of course
 
02:37:10.870 --> 02:37:10.880 align:start position:0%
those standards
 
02:37:12.550 --> 02:37:12.560 align:start position:0%
or not those standards but what is
 
02:37:14.870 --> 02:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
taught could vary obviously from from
 
02:37:17.110 --> 02:37:17.120 align:start position:0%
school to school the the evidence is
 
02:37:19.510 --> 02:37:19.520 align:start position:0%
that um
 
02:37:21.830 --> 02:37:21.840 align:start position:0%
through people i've talked to and others
 
02:37:24.550 --> 02:37:24.560 align:start position:0%
there's evidence that
 
02:37:27.030 --> 02:37:27.040 align:start position:0%
there are teachers that that have no
 
02:37:28.469 --> 02:37:28.479 align:start position:0%
idea what the minimum education
 
02:37:29.670 --> 02:37:29.680 align:start position:0%
standards are
 
02:37:32.070 --> 02:37:32.080 align:start position:0%
um and and maybe this maybe this becomes
 
02:37:33.670 --> 02:37:33.680 align:start position:0%
a bill focusing on that i i don't want
 
02:37:35.990 --> 02:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
to just decide that obviously right now
 
02:37:37.750 --> 02:37:37.760 align:start position:0%
but i think there definitely needs to be
 
02:37:39.590 --> 02:37:39.600 align:start position:0%
a discussion
 
02:37:43.750 --> 02:37:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:45.270 --> 02:37:45.280 align:start position:0%
thank you very much i'm wondering how
 
02:37:47.349 --> 02:37:47.359 align:start position:0%
you envision this happening because if
 
02:37:49.349 --> 02:37:49.359 align:start position:0%
you've got a student that's educated out
 
02:37:51.190 --> 02:37:51.200 align:start position:0%
of state and they want to apply for
 
02:37:53.190 --> 02:37:53.200 align:start position:0%
credentialing here do they have to then
 
02:37:54.630 --> 02:37:54.640 align:start position:0%
defer their credentialing for three
 
02:37:56.150 --> 02:37:56.160 align:start position:0%
months while they take a course on the
 
02:37:58.070 --> 02:37:58.080 align:start position:0%
rules of the state of new hampshire
 
02:38:00.309 --> 02:38:00.319 align:start position:0%
and to one end because for example i
 
02:38:01.670 --> 02:38:01.680 align:start position:0%
know my daughter who's a first grade
 
02:38:04.070 --> 02:38:04.080 align:start position:0%
teacher was educated at boston college
 
02:38:05.910 --> 02:38:05.920 align:start position:0%
both her teaching degree and her
 
02:38:08.150 --> 02:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
master's in education and while she was
 
02:38:09.990 --> 02:38:10.000 align:start position:0%
not educated specifically on the rules
 
02:38:12.630 --> 02:38:12.640 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire law she's most
 
02:38:14.230 --> 02:38:14.240 align:start position:0%
certainly in her child development
 
02:38:16.309 --> 02:38:16.319 align:start position:0%
classes and all the curriculum classes
 
02:38:18.630 --> 02:38:18.640 align:start position:0%
she took was educated and what the basic
 
02:38:20.309 --> 02:38:20.319 align:start position:0%
standard is that she needs to teach her
 
02:38:22.550 --> 02:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
first grade kids to get them reading so
 
02:38:24.870 --> 02:38:24.880 align:start position:0%
i'm at a loss as to what it is that's so
 
02:38:26.469 --> 02:38:26.479 align:start position:0%
specific about the new hampshire
 
02:38:28.309 --> 02:38:28.319 align:start position:0%
standards it's important and i'm at a
 
02:38:29.910 --> 02:38:29.920 align:start position:0%
loss as to understand how somebody
 
02:38:31.429 --> 02:38:31.439 align:start position:0%
educated out of state is supposed to
 
02:38:36.309 --> 02:38:36.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:38.550 --> 02:38:38.560 align:start position:0%
i mean all i can say is there's the the
 
02:38:40.150 --> 02:38:40.160 align:start position:0%
education rules
 
02:38:42.630 --> 02:38:42.640 align:start position:0%
and minimum standards are there for re i
 
02:38:44.950 --> 02:38:44.960 align:start position:0%
mean the rules have been created i
 
02:38:48.550 --> 02:38:48.560 align:start position:0%
if somebody's from out of state um
 
02:38:51.429 --> 02:38:51.439 align:start position:0%
if this is new hampshire's uh law
 
02:38:51.439 --> 02:38:52.389 align:start position:0%
if this is new hampshire's uh law
then

02:38:52.389 --> 02:38:52.399 align:start position:0%
then
 
02:38:54.790 --> 02:38:54.800 align:start position:0%
they would have to you know abide by it
 
02:38:56.790 --> 02:38:56.800 align:start position:0%
and they would need to take a course
 
02:38:59.510 --> 02:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
i mean i guess it's it'd be similar to
 
02:39:01.830 --> 02:39:01.840 align:start position:0%
you know a realtor let's say
 
02:39:03.270 --> 02:39:03.280 align:start position:0%
i mean there's a myriad of different
 
02:39:05.429 --> 02:39:05.439 align:start position:0%
examples but you know realtors licensed
 
02:39:06.870 --> 02:39:06.880 align:start position:0%
in a certain state
 
02:39:09.590 --> 02:39:09.600 align:start position:0%
they don't automatically just get to go
 
02:39:11.270 --> 02:39:11.280 align:start position:0%
be licensed in another state without
 
02:39:13.030 --> 02:39:13.040 align:start position:0%
sometimes they have to take some some
 
02:39:14.469 --> 02:39:14.479 align:start position:0%
courses and
 
02:39:18.070 --> 02:39:18.080 align:start position:0%
and then take the testing so i i think
 
02:39:20.389 --> 02:39:20.399 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about
 
02:39:22.469 --> 02:39:22.479 align:start position:0%
out of state
 
02:39:23.910 --> 02:39:23.920 align:start position:0%
i would just imagine they need to follow
 
02:39:27.990 --> 02:39:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:32.550 --> 02:39:32.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:34.389 --> 02:39:34.399 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:39:37.429 --> 02:39:37.439 align:start position:0%
when i did my teacher certification
 
02:39:39.190 --> 02:39:39.200 align:start position:0%
i took a course called teacher in the
 
02:39:41.910 --> 02:39:41.920 align:start position:0%
law and we talked about federal law
 
02:39:43.270 --> 02:39:43.280 align:start position:0%
state law
 
02:39:46.070 --> 02:39:46.080 align:start position:0%
rules how that applied to what we needed
 
02:39:49.270 --> 02:39:49.280 align:start position:0%
to be doing we did not cover
 
02:39:51.670 --> 02:39:51.680 align:start position:0%
all of this
 
02:39:55.349 --> 02:39:55.359 align:start position:0%
we couldn't have we covered the basics
 
02:39:55.359 --> 02:39:57.349 align:start position:0%
we couldn't have we covered the basics
and

02:39:57.349 --> 02:39:57.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:39:59.270 --> 02:39:59.280 align:start position:0%
now it's been
 
02:40:01.830 --> 02:40:01.840 align:start position:0%
i don't want to say how many years but
 
02:40:03.910 --> 02:40:03.920 align:start position:0%
it's been quite a few years
 
02:40:06.790 --> 02:40:06.800 align:start position:0%
this all keeps changing year to year so
 
02:40:08.630 --> 02:40:08.640 align:start position:0%
how do you
 
02:40:12.150 --> 02:40:12.160 align:start position:0%
you know so okay when i was accredited i
 
02:40:14.550 --> 02:40:14.560 align:start position:0%
you know got my certification i learned
 
02:40:16.389 --> 02:40:16.399 align:start position:0%
all of this stuff a lot of it doesn't
 
02:40:18.710 --> 02:40:18.720 align:start position:0%
apply anymore
 
02:40:24.389 --> 02:40:24.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:28.630 --> 02:40:28.640 align:start position:0%
well base based on a lot of the um
 
02:40:30.150 --> 02:40:30.160 align:start position:0%
questions and commentary i'm hearing
 
02:40:31.190 --> 02:40:31.200 align:start position:0%
i've been hearing since i've been up
 
02:40:32.710 --> 02:40:32.720 align:start position:0%
here it sounds like
 
02:40:34.389 --> 02:40:34.399 align:start position:0%
there needs to be a focus
 
02:40:36.469 --> 02:40:36.479 align:start position:0%
in in
 
02:40:38.150 --> 02:40:38.160 align:start position:0%
what may be deemed the most important
 
02:40:39.670 --> 02:40:39.680 align:start position:0%
area which to me would be minimum
 
02:40:42.710 --> 02:40:42.720 align:start position:0%
education standards to make sure that
 
02:40:44.469 --> 02:40:44.479 align:start position:0%
students have at least the minimum
 
02:40:44.479 --> 02:40:45.670 align:start position:0%
students have at least the minimum
obviously

02:40:45.670 --> 02:40:45.680 align:start position:0%
obviously
 
02:40:47.670 --> 02:40:47.680 align:start position:0%
teachers can go way beyond the minimum
 
02:40:49.750 --> 02:40:49.760 align:start position:0%
but it sounds to me maybe maybe this
 
02:40:51.910 --> 02:40:51.920 align:start position:0%
should be a bill where we're focusing on
 
02:40:54.150 --> 02:40:54.160 align:start position:0%
the minimum education standards of
 
02:40:54.160 --> 02:40:57.269 align:start position:0%
the minimum education standards of
students

02:40:57.269 --> 02:40:57.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:59.510 --> 02:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
further questions representative waltz
 
02:41:00.710 --> 02:41:00.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:41:02.630 --> 02:41:02.640 align:start position:0%
it would seem to me that most teachers
 
02:41:04.550 --> 02:41:04.560 align:start position:0%
are teaching from curriculum directed by
 
02:41:06.550 --> 02:41:06.560 align:start position:0%
the district in which they teach and
 
02:41:08.070 --> 02:41:08.080 align:start position:0%
that the director of curriculum should
 
02:41:09.349 --> 02:41:09.359 align:start position:0%
be the one that's really focused on the
 
02:41:11.349 --> 02:41:11.359 align:start position:0%
minimum education standards that that's
 
02:41:13.269 --> 02:41:13.279 align:start position:0%
their job and then it's the job of the
 
02:41:15.910 --> 02:41:15.920 align:start position:0%
teacher to follow the curriculum of that
 
02:41:17.510 --> 02:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
district so that they would not
 
02:41:19.269 --> 02:41:19.279 align:start position:0%
necessarily have to know the minimum
 
02:41:21.190 --> 02:41:21.200 align:start position:0%
education standards don't you agree that
 
02:41:25.910 --> 02:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:27.750 --> 02:41:27.760 align:start position:0%
i it makes sense but i'd have to think
 
02:41:30.389 --> 02:41:30.399 align:start position:0%
about that some more
 
02:41:31.590 --> 02:41:31.600 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
 
02:41:31.600 --> 02:41:33.510 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
representative

02:41:33.510 --> 02:41:33.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:41:35.510 --> 02:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
um thanks very much thanks for joining
 
02:41:37.190 --> 02:41:37.200 align:start position:0%
us this morning
 
02:41:39.349 --> 02:41:39.359 align:start position:0%
and uh and for your concern about
 
02:41:41.510 --> 02:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
students um
 
02:41:43.510 --> 02:41:43.520 align:start position:0%
being educated to at least the minimum
 
02:41:45.910 --> 02:41:45.920 align:start position:0%
educational standards um my question
 
02:41:47.670 --> 02:41:47.680 align:start position:0%
actually the question sort of goes to
 
02:41:48.950 --> 02:41:48.960 align:start position:0%
that though what are what are your
 
02:41:50.550 --> 02:41:50.560 align:start position:0%
thoughts as far as
 
02:41:51.990 --> 02:41:52.000 align:start position:0%
how um
 
02:41:54.070 --> 02:41:54.080 align:start position:0%
stay you know the average student
 
02:41:54.080 --> 02:41:55.349 align:start position:0%
stay you know the average student
statewide

02:41:55.349 --> 02:41:55.359 align:start position:0%
statewide
 
02:41:59.030 --> 02:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
is uh is performing um you know
 
02:42:03.110 --> 02:42:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:05.269 --> 02:42:05.279 align:start position:0%
i guess there's no problem is what
 
02:42:06.469 --> 02:42:06.479 align:start position:0%
yeah i mean
 
02:42:08.389 --> 02:42:08.399 align:start position:0%
i don't have data on that my my sense is
 
02:42:11.030 --> 02:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
that new hampshire is doing fairly well
 
02:42:13.349 --> 02:42:13.359 align:start position:0%
but i think
 
02:42:15.429 --> 02:42:15.439 align:start position:0%
always striving to improve further is
 
02:42:17.670 --> 02:42:17.680 align:start position:0%
certainly would be i think a goal that
 
02:42:18.710 --> 02:42:18.720 align:start position:0%
would be
 
02:42:21.510 --> 02:42:21.520 align:start position:0%
always worthwhile
 
02:42:22.710 --> 02:42:22.720 align:start position:0%
thank you very much other further
 
02:42:22.720 --> 02:42:23.910 align:start position:0%
thank you very much other further
questions

02:42:23.910 --> 02:42:23.920 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:42:25.429 --> 02:42:25.439 align:start position:0%
not cnn's thank you very much
 
02:42:30.150 --> 02:42:30.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:31.670 --> 02:42:31.680 align:start position:0%
all right i won't call you
 
02:42:33.990 --> 02:42:34.000 align:start position:0%

02:42:40.550 --> 02:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
something to offer
 
02:42:42.870 --> 02:42:42.880 align:start position:0%
we will need pink cards for those which
 
02:42:42.880 --> 02:42:43.750 align:start position:0%
we will need pink cards for those which
are

02:42:43.750 --> 02:42:43.760 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:42:43.760 --> 02:42:44.710 align:start position:0%
are
um

02:42:44.710 --> 02:42:44.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:42:47.269 --> 02:42:47.279 align:start position:0%
are testifying or presenting some
 
02:42:49.510 --> 02:42:49.520 align:start position:0%
support even on an informational basis

part
welcome

welcome
 
02:42:57.750 --> 02:42:57.760 align:start position:0%
thank you and good morning
 
02:42:58.950 --> 02:42:58.960 align:start position:0%
representatives and thank you for your
 
02:43:01.750 --> 02:43:01.760 align:start position:0%
time um steve appleby director of
 
02:43:03.269 --> 02:43:03.279 align:start position:0%
educator support and higher education at
 
02:43:04.710 --> 02:43:04.720 align:start position:0%
the department of ed
 
02:43:06.230 --> 02:43:06.240 align:start position:0%
i oversee
 
02:43:07.830 --> 02:43:07.840 align:start position:0%
our credentialing educator credentialing
 
02:43:09.830 --> 02:43:09.840 align:start position:0%
function and uh with me here is
 
02:43:12.710 --> 02:43:12.720 align:start position:0%
administrator nate green
 
02:43:14.469 --> 02:43:14.479 align:start position:0%
all right so for the record nate green
 
02:43:16.630 --> 02:43:16.640 align:start position:0%
department of education uh i'm here to
 
02:43:18.550 --> 02:43:18.560 align:start position:0%
support steve on this particular bill as
 
02:43:20.230 --> 02:43:20.240 align:start position:0%
i oversee the minimum standards and
 
02:43:22.469 --> 02:43:22.479 align:start position:0%
administrative rules for schools uh so
 
02:43:24.230 --> 02:43:24.240 align:start position:0%
sort of the teacher certification side
 
02:43:27.670 --> 02:43:27.680 align:start position:0%
and administrative rules side
 
02:43:29.429 --> 02:43:29.439 align:start position:0%
thank you i was hoping to potentially
 
02:43:31.030 --> 02:43:31.040 align:start position:0%
maybe answer a few of the questions that
 
02:43:33.429 --> 02:43:33.439 align:start position:0%
i just heard um to shed some light on
 
02:43:38.309 --> 02:43:38.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:40.469 --> 02:43:40.479 align:start position:0%
today we have 12
 
02:43:42.070 --> 02:43:42.080 align:start position:0%
institutions of higher education in our
 
02:43:43.990 --> 02:43:44.000 align:start position:0%
state that are approved by the state
 
02:43:46.150 --> 02:43:46.160 align:start position:0%
board of education to
 
02:43:48.150 --> 02:43:48.160 align:start position:0%
have teacher programs right educator
 
02:43:51.429 --> 02:43:51.439 align:start position:0%
preparation programs and
 
02:43:53.750 --> 02:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
nowhere in our state rule do we require
 
02:43:55.349 --> 02:43:55.359 align:start position:0%
them to teach anything to do with new
 
02:43:59.670 --> 02:43:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:01.269 --> 02:44:01.279 align:start position:0%
they do teach classes for example
 
02:44:03.349 --> 02:44:03.359 align:start position:0%
special ed candidates go through special
 
02:44:04.950 --> 02:44:04.960 align:start position:0%
ed law classes
 
02:44:06.790 --> 02:44:06.800 align:start position:0%
the majority of that focuses on federal
 
02:44:06.800 --> 02:44:08.630 align:start position:0%
the majority of that focuses on federal
requirements

02:44:08.630 --> 02:44:08.640 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
02:44:09.670 --> 02:44:09.680 align:start position:0%
very little of that is state
 
02:44:09.680 --> 02:44:13.590 align:start position:0%
very little of that is state
requirements

02:44:13.590 --> 02:44:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:16.469 --> 02:44:16.479 align:start position:0%
putting something in statute that would
 
02:44:18.550 --> 02:44:18.560 align:start position:0%
require the programs to teach something
 
02:44:20.630 --> 02:44:20.640 align:start position:0%
about new hampshire rules
 
02:44:23.830 --> 02:44:23.840 align:start position:0%
seems logical to us from the standpoint
 
02:44:24.950 --> 02:44:24.960 align:start position:0%
that it
 
02:44:24.960 --> 02:44:25.910 align:start position:0%
that it
um

02:44:25.910 --> 02:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:44:27.750 --> 02:44:27.760 align:start position:0%
everyone comes out of school at the same
 
02:44:27.760 --> 02:44:28.950 align:start position:0%
everyone comes out of school at the same
level

02:44:28.950 --> 02:44:28.960 align:start position:0%
level
 
02:44:30.469 --> 02:44:30.479 align:start position:0%
additionally there was a comment about
 
02:44:33.510 --> 02:44:33.520 align:start position:0%
out of state currently many other states
 
02:44:35.990 --> 02:44:36.000 align:start position:0%
have state specific requirements so when
 
02:44:37.590 --> 02:44:37.600 align:start position:0%
an educator moves to that state for
 
02:44:39.030 --> 02:44:39.040 align:start position:0%
example georgia
 
02:44:40.630 --> 02:44:40.640 align:start position:0%
if you move to georgia and you want to
 
02:44:42.790 --> 02:44:42.800 align:start position:0%
teach in georgia you have to take a
 
02:44:44.710 --> 02:44:44.720 align:start position:0%
georgia history class
 
02:44:46.870 --> 02:44:46.880 align:start position:0%
in order to get your teaching license
 
02:44:48.230 --> 02:44:48.240 align:start position:0%
so what's the solution we don't want to
 
02:44:50.309 --> 02:44:50.319 align:start position:0%
create a bottleneck or a shortage any
 
02:44:51.990 --> 02:44:52.000 align:start position:0%
worse than it already is
 
02:44:54.070 --> 02:44:54.080 align:start position:0%
we have already in existence an intern
 
02:44:55.590 --> 02:44:55.600 align:start position:0%
license program
 
02:44:57.590 --> 02:44:57.600 align:start position:0%
an educator can come here if they
 
02:44:59.349 --> 02:44:59.359 align:start position:0%
haven't met all the requirements they
 
02:45:00.870 --> 02:45:00.880 align:start position:0%
can start in the classroom immediately
 
02:45:03.269 --> 02:45:03.279 align:start position:0%
on an intern license they can complete
 
02:45:04.870 --> 02:45:04.880 align:start position:0%
their requirements and then apply for
 
02:45:06.309 --> 02:45:06.319 align:start position:0%
full licensure
 
02:45:09.190 --> 02:45:09.200 align:start position:0%
so we envision if this law were to pass
 
02:45:11.030 --> 02:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
that we could use that for out-of-state
 
02:45:11.040 --> 02:45:13.429 align:start position:0%
that we could use that for out-of-state
educators

02:45:13.429 --> 02:45:13.439 align:start position:0%
educators
 
02:45:15.429 --> 02:45:15.439 align:start position:0%
the ask of moving the effective date out
 
02:45:18.389 --> 02:45:18.399 align:start position:0%
was at our request because this will
 
02:45:18.399 --> 02:45:19.269 align:start position:0%
was at our request because this will
give

02:45:19.269 --> 02:45:19.279 align:start position:0%
give
 
02:45:20.950 --> 02:45:20.960 align:start position:0%
our programs time to develop and
 
02:45:22.630 --> 02:45:22.640 align:start position:0%
implement a class
 
02:45:23.830 --> 02:45:23.840 align:start position:0%
so that
 
02:45:25.670 --> 02:45:25.680 align:start position:0%
our current folks in the pipeline don't
 
02:45:27.670 --> 02:45:27.680 align:start position:0%
miss a beat
 
02:45:27.680 --> 02:45:28.710 align:start position:0%
miss a beat
the

02:45:28.710 --> 02:45:28.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:45:30.389 --> 02:45:30.399 align:start position:0%
informal survey i did of some of the
 
02:45:34.870 --> 02:45:34.880 align:start position:0%
ihes said that january 1st was doable
 
02:45:37.190 --> 02:45:37.200 align:start position:0%
so hence the date there
 
02:45:38.790 --> 02:45:38.800 align:start position:0%
as far as the law is always changing i
 
02:45:40.630 --> 02:45:40.640 align:start position:0%
heard that question was a great question
 
02:45:42.389 --> 02:45:42.399 align:start position:0%
they do change every year we know that
 
02:45:44.309 --> 02:45:44.319 align:start position:0%
as best of anyone
 
02:45:45.990 --> 02:45:46.000 align:start position:0%
and all i would say there is many
 
02:45:47.990 --> 02:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
requirements change every year and
 
02:45:49.590 --> 02:45:49.600 align:start position:0%
perhaps in this bill we should address
 
02:45:51.429 --> 02:45:51.439 align:start position:0%
professional development
 
02:45:51.439 --> 02:45:52.469 align:start position:0%
professional development
because

02:45:52.469 --> 02:45:52.479 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:45:53.750 --> 02:45:53.760 align:start position:0%
if you think about curriculum that's
 
02:45:55.030 --> 02:45:55.040 align:start position:0%
taught today
 
02:45:56.870 --> 02:45:56.880 align:start position:0%
every three years our educators have to
 
02:45:57.990 --> 02:45:58.000 align:start position:0%
have professional development to
 
02:45:58.000 --> 02:45:59.269 align:start position:0%
have professional development to
recertify

02:45:59.269 --> 02:45:59.279 align:start position:0%
recertify
 
02:46:00.950 --> 02:46:00.960 align:start position:0%
so perhaps that could be something that
 
02:46:02.230 --> 02:46:02.240 align:start position:0%
could be added
 
02:46:04.469 --> 02:46:04.479 align:start position:0%
that maybe it's professional development
 
02:46:05.830 --> 02:46:05.840 align:start position:0%
the last piece and then i'll let nate
 
02:46:07.590 --> 02:46:07.600 align:start position:0%
take over would be
 
02:46:07.600 --> 02:46:09.830 align:start position:0%
take over would be
administrators

02:46:09.830 --> 02:46:09.840 align:start position:0%
administrators
 
02:46:11.590 --> 02:46:11.600 align:start position:0%
number of our educators will go down
 
02:46:13.190 --> 02:46:13.200 align:start position:0%
into administration whether that's
 
02:46:15.670 --> 02:46:15.680 align:start position:0%
principal special ed director
 
02:46:17.990 --> 02:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
maybe someday superintendent
 
02:46:20.550 --> 02:46:20.560 align:start position:0%
and while it does not seem to make sense
 
02:46:22.469 --> 02:46:22.479 align:start position:0%
to teach a teacher about
 
02:46:25.349 --> 02:46:25.359 align:start position:0%
busing and transportation rules
 
02:46:26.710 --> 02:46:26.720 align:start position:0%
it may make sense if they go for an
 
02:46:28.230 --> 02:46:28.240 align:start position:0%
advanced certification that they have to
 
02:46:29.429 --> 02:46:29.439 align:start position:0%
learn it then
 
02:46:32.469 --> 02:46:32.479 align:start position:0%
so again perhaps maybe in the bill
 
02:46:34.790 --> 02:46:34.800 align:start position:0%
we could break out several tiers
 
02:46:36.630 --> 02:46:36.640 align:start position:0%
of what would be required
 
02:46:38.950 --> 02:46:38.960 align:start position:0%
so teachers minimum standards
 
02:46:40.870 --> 02:46:40.880 align:start position:0%
administrators maybe need to know more
 
02:46:42.469 --> 02:46:42.479 align:start position:0%
advanced topics
 
02:46:44.230 --> 02:46:44.240 align:start position:0%
that would be a suggestion
 
02:46:45.910 --> 02:46:45.920 align:start position:0%
so and i'm going to turn it over nate to
 
02:46:47.269 --> 02:46:47.279 align:start position:0%
to speak to some of that as well from
 
02:46:48.580 --> 02:46:48.590 align:start position:0%
the minimum standard site
 
02:46:48.590 --> 02:46:50.070 align:start position:0%
the minimum standard site
[Music]

02:46:50.070 --> 02:46:50.080 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:46:51.750 --> 02:46:51.760 align:start position:0%
i don't know i think you answered most
 
02:46:53.030 --> 02:46:53.040 align:start position:0%
of the i'm not sure what else i can add
 
02:46:54.150 --> 02:46:54.160 align:start position:0%
to that
 
02:46:55.590 --> 02:46:55.600 align:start position:0%
uh unless there are additional questions
 
02:46:57.510 --> 02:46:57.520 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to take
 
02:46:59.590 --> 02:46:59.600 align:start position:0%
okay okay so i'll open up with a
 
02:47:01.429 --> 02:47:01.439 align:start position:0%
question then i'll move it around the
 
02:47:02.950 --> 02:47:02.960 align:start position:0%
committee here
 
02:47:02.960 --> 02:47:03.910 align:start position:0%
committee here
um

02:47:03.910 --> 02:47:03.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:47:06.469 --> 02:47:06.479 align:start position:0%
of course i've i've had the courses on
 
02:47:08.550 --> 02:47:08.560 align:start position:0%
school law but it was generic in my
 
02:47:10.230 --> 02:47:10.240 align:start position:0%
master's program because i was going for
 
02:47:13.110 --> 02:47:13.120 align:start position:0%
administration and supervision
 
02:47:13.120 --> 02:47:13.990 align:start position:0%
administration and supervision
um

02:47:13.990 --> 02:47:14.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:47:17.510 --> 02:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
finance as well however if i'm a speech
 
02:47:20.469 --> 02:47:20.479 align:start position:0%
pathologist in myrtle beach
 
02:47:21.830 --> 02:47:21.840 align:start position:0%
and i'm looking to come where the
 
02:47:23.510 --> 02:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
climate is wonderful and it's always
 
02:47:25.830 --> 02:47:25.840 align:start position:0%
warm up here in new hampshire
 
02:47:25.840 --> 02:47:27.190 align:start position:0%
warm up here in new hampshire
and

02:47:27.190 --> 02:47:27.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:47:30.550 --> 02:47:30.560 align:start position:0%
i'd like to know why
 
02:47:33.750 --> 02:47:33.760 align:start position:0%
when i as a speech pathologist and very
 
02:47:36.950 --> 02:47:36.960 align:start position:0%
familiar with the regulations associated
 
02:47:39.190 --> 02:47:39.200 align:start position:0%
with idea
 
02:47:41.349 --> 02:47:41.359 align:start position:0%
which are federal
 
02:47:43.349 --> 02:47:43.359 align:start position:0%
and which are very comparable in most
 
02:47:45.510 --> 02:47:45.520 align:start position:0%
states except this state which we go
 
02:47:47.429 --> 02:47:47.439 align:start position:0%
above and beyond
 
02:47:48.950 --> 02:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
but why
 
02:47:52.389 --> 02:47:52.399 align:start position:0%
would i then have to go through this
 
02:47:52.399 --> 02:47:53.910 align:start position:0%
would i then have to go through this
hurdle

02:47:53.910 --> 02:47:53.920 align:start position:0%
hurdle
 
02:47:53.920 --> 02:47:55.269 align:start position:0%
hurdle
to

02:47:55.269 --> 02:47:55.279 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:47:57.110 --> 02:47:57.120 align:start position:0%
take some kind of a
 
02:48:00.070 --> 02:48:00.080 align:start position:0%
assessment or that when we are already
 
02:48:03.190 --> 02:48:03.200 align:start position:0%
shy in the state speech pathologists or
 
02:48:05.510 --> 02:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
life skills teachers
 
02:48:07.190 --> 02:48:07.200 align:start position:0%
or even now
 
02:48:08.790 --> 02:48:08.800 align:start position:0%
teacher teachers in the elementary
 
02:48:10.309 --> 02:48:10.319 align:start position:0%
school in the high school
 
02:48:11.590 --> 02:48:11.600 align:start position:0%
which uh
 
02:48:14.150 --> 02:48:14.160 align:start position:0%
due to the situation we have with covid
 
02:48:16.710 --> 02:48:16.720 align:start position:0%
so i i just under i'm just
 
02:48:18.389 --> 02:48:18.399 align:start position:0%
wondering why
 
02:48:18.399 --> 02:48:19.670 align:start position:0%
wondering why
um

02:48:19.670 --> 02:48:19.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:48:22.469 --> 02:48:22.479 align:start position:0%
this has to be done on a state level i'm
 
02:48:23.750 --> 02:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
sure that
 
02:48:26.309 --> 02:48:26.319 align:start position:0%
at a local level if there's something
 
02:48:27.910 --> 02:48:27.920 align:start position:0%
pertinent to what they're doing in that
 
02:48:30.230 --> 02:48:30.240 align:start position:0%
classroom that's relevant as far as a
 
02:48:32.950 --> 02:48:32.960 align:start position:0%
rule that it can be explained by that
 
02:48:35.030 --> 02:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
supervisor in that school
 
02:48:37.110 --> 02:48:37.120 align:start position:0%
i'm just having difficulty understanding
 
02:48:45.349 --> 02:48:45.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:47.670 --> 02:48:47.680 align:start position:0%
sure um i mean i can provide some
 
02:48:51.030 --> 02:48:51.040 align:start position:0%
theoretical examples um and i you know
 
02:48:52.710 --> 02:48:52.720 align:start position:0%
same as you you know i didn't you know
 
02:48:55.030 --> 02:48:55.040 align:start position:0%
really become introduced to uh any kind
 
02:48:56.710 --> 02:48:56.720 align:start position:0%
of public school law until i went into
 
02:48:58.230 --> 02:48:58.240 align:start position:0%
my master's and doctor courses in
 
02:48:58.240 --> 02:48:59.750 align:start position:0%
my master's and doctor courses in
education

02:48:59.750 --> 02:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
education
 
02:49:01.190 --> 02:49:01.200 align:start position:0%
and so i think sometimes it is difficult
 
02:49:03.030 --> 02:49:03.040 align:start position:0%
to see from that beginning teacher who's
 
02:49:04.309 --> 02:49:04.319 align:start position:0%
who's just getting their bachelor's
 
02:49:05.910 --> 02:49:05.920 align:start position:0%
degree getting their license going into
 
02:49:07.030 --> 02:49:07.040 align:start position:0%
the classroom
 
02:49:08.710 --> 02:49:08.720 align:start position:0%
you know why they need to know new
 
02:49:10.309 --> 02:49:10.319 align:start position:0%
hampshire specific
 
02:49:12.389 --> 02:49:12.399 align:start position:0%
rules and statutes and laws
 
02:49:14.550 --> 02:49:14.560 align:start position:0%
um i think one thing that it has the
 
02:49:16.469 --> 02:49:16.479 align:start position:0%
potential to do for teachers is it opens
 
02:49:19.030 --> 02:49:19.040 align:start position:0%
up the possibility for innovation
 
02:49:21.110 --> 02:49:21.120 align:start position:0%
because when we go out and we meet with
 
02:49:22.630 --> 02:49:22.640 align:start position:0%
schools and we talk to them you know if
 
02:49:24.469 --> 02:49:24.479 align:start position:0%
you're a school that is a low-performing
 
02:49:25.910 --> 02:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
school you're looking for strategies to
 
02:49:27.429 --> 02:49:27.439 align:start position:0%
reach out to your students
 
02:49:29.670 --> 02:49:29.680 align:start position:0%
oftentimes teachers and administrators
 
02:49:31.349 --> 02:49:31.359 align:start position:0%
feel like they have to continue to do
 
02:49:32.790 --> 02:49:32.800 align:start position:0%
things the same way they've always done
 
02:49:34.870 --> 02:49:34.880 align:start position:0%
them because that's what's required by
 
02:49:36.150 --> 02:49:36.160 align:start position:0%
administrative rule that's what's
 
02:49:37.910 --> 02:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
required by statute there's an
 
02:49:40.309 --> 02:49:40.319 align:start position:0%
assumption that business is the way that
 
02:49:42.230 --> 02:49:42.240 align:start position:0%
it is because that's what's required by
 
02:49:44.870 --> 02:49:44.880 align:start position:0%
the state and an unfamiliarity with some
 
02:49:46.469 --> 02:49:46.479 align:start position:0%
of our administrative rules and some of
 
02:49:48.630 --> 02:49:48.640 align:start position:0%
our statutes prevents teachers i think
 
02:49:50.630 --> 02:49:50.640 align:start position:0%
from seeing where in rural and where in
 
02:49:53.030 --> 02:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
statute they can deviate and where they
 
02:49:55.190 --> 02:49:55.200 align:start position:0%
can take advantage of areas that they
 
02:49:56.950 --> 02:49:56.960 align:start position:0%
could innovate in the classroom or
 
02:49:58.469 --> 02:49:58.479 align:start position:0%
within their school or within their
 
02:50:00.710 --> 02:50:00.720 align:start position:0%
district so as a as a theoretical
 
02:50:01.830 --> 02:50:01.840 align:start position:0%
possibility i think a greater
 
02:50:03.910 --> 02:50:03.920 align:start position:0%
familiarity with the structure that we
 
02:50:06.230 --> 02:50:06.240 align:start position:0%
have in our state opens up to teachers
 
02:50:08.070 --> 02:50:08.080 align:start position:0%
and knowledge of where they can branch
 
02:50:11.269 --> 02:50:11.279 align:start position:0%
out and think outside of the box
 
02:50:13.990 --> 02:50:14.000 align:start position:0%
thank you represent porter
 
02:50:15.670 --> 02:50:15.680 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you mr chair and i
 
02:50:17.429 --> 02:50:17.439 align:start position:0%
actually have a couple of questions if
 
02:50:19.110 --> 02:50:19.120 align:start position:0%
that's all right well let's hear the
 
02:50:21.429 --> 02:50:21.439 align:start position:0%
first one first
 
02:50:23.910 --> 02:50:23.920 align:start position:0%
so how do you envision this course i'm a
 
02:50:27.590 --> 02:50:27.600 align:start position:0%
junior in college and i'm preparing to
 
02:50:30.630 --> 02:50:30.640 align:start position:0%
to teach elementary school
 
02:50:30.640 --> 02:50:31.670 align:start position:0%
to teach elementary school
and

02:50:31.670 --> 02:50:31.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:50:34.469 --> 02:50:34.479 align:start position:0%
i have to take a course in new hampshire
 
02:50:35.750 --> 02:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
school law
 
02:50:38.070 --> 02:50:38.080 align:start position:0%
and new hampshire school rules
 
02:50:39.910 --> 02:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
it's a full semester course i meet three
 
02:50:42.309 --> 02:50:42.319 align:start position:0%
days a week for so many hours
 
02:50:44.389 --> 02:50:44.399 align:start position:0%
who teaches it where do they get the
 
02:50:47.670 --> 02:50:47.680 align:start position:0%
textbooks how are they tested on it
 
02:50:50.790 --> 02:50:50.800 align:start position:0%
spread it out show me the course
 
02:50:53.590 --> 02:50:53.600 align:start position:0%
what's the course like
 
02:50:56.630 --> 02:50:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:58.790 --> 02:50:58.800 align:start position:0%
diving into the intention of this
 
02:50:59.990 --> 02:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
particular bill or this particular
 
02:51:01.990 --> 02:51:02.000 align:start position:0%
legislation i think you know we would
 
02:51:03.670 --> 02:51:03.680 align:start position:0%
need to look at the wording does this
 
02:51:06.790 --> 02:51:06.800 align:start position:0%
need to be a full course or is the
 
02:51:08.950 --> 02:51:08.960 align:start position:0%
intention more to provide familiarity
 
02:51:11.269 --> 02:51:11.279 align:start position:0%
with teachers of administrative roles
 
02:51:13.030 --> 02:51:13.040 align:start position:0%
and right now i know that the current
 
02:51:14.469 --> 02:51:14.479 align:start position:0%
bill just talks about administrative
 
02:51:17.110 --> 02:51:17.120 align:start position:0%
rules as opposed to law and statute
 
02:51:19.830 --> 02:51:19.840 align:start position:0%
i think it's at its smallest at its most
 
02:51:21.510 --> 02:51:21.520 align:start position:0%
basic where you can provide the most
 
02:51:23.510 --> 02:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
benefit across the board is that
 
02:51:25.429 --> 02:51:25.439 align:start position:0%
familiarity with the minimum standards
 
02:51:27.429 --> 02:51:27.439 align:start position:0%
administrative rules and so perhaps that
 
02:51:29.429 --> 02:51:29.439 align:start position:0%
isn't a full course perhaps that's
 
02:51:30.790 --> 02:51:30.800 align:start position:0%
something that could be included as part
 
02:51:32.550 --> 02:51:32.560 align:start position:0%
of the curriculum within the teacher
 
02:51:34.309 --> 02:51:34.319 align:start position:0%
prep program in one of the current
 
02:51:36.070 --> 02:51:36.080 align:start position:0%
courses that teachers are already taking
 
02:51:38.710 --> 02:51:38.720 align:start position:0%
i think that's the the smallest lift i
 
02:51:41.190 --> 02:51:41.200 align:start position:0%
agree if it is a single course a
 
02:51:43.030 --> 02:51:43.040 align:start position:0%
standalone you would want to be more
 
02:51:45.349 --> 02:51:45.359 align:start position:0%
expansive than just administrative roles
 
02:51:46.950 --> 02:51:46.960 align:start position:0%
you would want to go into law and
 
02:51:46.960 --> 02:51:48.389 align:start position:0%
you would want to go into law and
statute

02:51:48.389 --> 02:51:48.399 align:start position:0%
statute
 
02:51:50.790 --> 02:51:50.800 align:start position:0%
can i follow up sir yes you may okay so
 
02:51:53.670 --> 02:51:53.680 align:start position:0%
when i was working toward my cags and my
 
02:51:53.680 --> 02:51:54.950 align:start position:0%
when i was working toward my cags and my
my

02:51:54.950 --> 02:51:54.960 align:start position:0%
my
 
02:51:56.790 --> 02:51:56.800 align:start position:0%
administrative certificate i took a
 
02:51:59.269 --> 02:51:59.279 align:start position:0%
course in school law
 
02:52:01.750 --> 02:52:01.760 align:start position:0%
it was like like the chair said it was a
 
02:52:03.990 --> 02:52:04.000 align:start position:0%
general course it was a full semester
 
02:52:05.590 --> 02:52:05.600 align:start position:0%
heavy load
 
02:52:07.349 --> 02:52:07.359 align:start position:0%
as a graduate student with a lot of
 
02:52:12.870 --> 02:52:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:16.469 --> 02:52:16.479 align:start position:0%
would this not be better placed
 
02:52:19.590 --> 02:52:19.600 align:start position:0%
in training and sort of certificate
 
02:52:22.630 --> 02:52:22.640 align:start position:0%
granting to at the administrative level
 
02:52:23.990 --> 02:52:24.000 align:start position:0%
with the understanding that the
 
02:52:26.309 --> 02:52:26.319 align:start position:0%
administrators are the ones who would
 
02:52:28.150 --> 02:52:28.160 align:start position:0%
share this knowledge with their
 
02:52:30.630 --> 02:52:30.640 align:start position:0%
classroom teachers who
 
02:52:32.469 --> 02:52:32.479 align:start position:0%
to be honest are concerned about wiping
 
02:52:34.710 --> 02:52:34.720 align:start position:0%
kids noses a lot of time of the day and
 
02:52:36.550 --> 02:52:36.560 align:start position:0%
that kind of stuff i mean that they have
 
02:52:38.469 --> 02:52:38.479 align:start position:0%
those down to earth issues to be
 
02:52:39.910 --> 02:52:39.920 align:start position:0%
concerned about
 
02:52:41.990 --> 02:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
would this not be better placed for a
 
02:52:45.830 --> 02:52:45.840 align:start position:0%
certificate for an administrator
 
02:52:48.150 --> 02:52:48.160 align:start position:0%
i think that it could have placed in
 
02:52:50.790 --> 02:52:50.800 align:start position:0%
both of those with a different focus
 
02:52:52.790 --> 02:52:52.800 align:start position:0%
i think absolutely there's a larger
 
02:52:54.469 --> 02:52:54.479 align:start position:0%
focus when we start talking about things
 
02:52:57.590 --> 02:52:57.600 align:start position:0%
like transportation and cte education
 
02:52:59.590 --> 02:52:59.600 align:start position:0%
and things that are not going to be an
 
02:53:01.510 --> 02:53:01.520 align:start position:0%
immediate priority for most of our
 
02:53:03.590 --> 02:53:03.600 align:start position:0%
classroom teachers absolutely that
 
02:53:05.830 --> 02:53:05.840 align:start position:0%
probably has a better place with
 
02:53:05.840 --> 02:53:07.349 align:start position:0%
probably has a better place with
administrators

02:53:07.349 --> 02:53:07.359 align:start position:0%
administrators
 
02:53:09.030 --> 02:53:09.040 align:start position:0%
which is why i mentioned i think when we
 
02:53:10.630 --> 02:53:10.640 align:start position:0%
talk about just the minimum standards
 
02:53:12.710 --> 02:53:12.720 align:start position:0%
themselves that particular part of
 
02:53:14.389 --> 02:53:14.399 align:start position:0%
administrative rule probably has the
 
02:53:16.710 --> 02:53:16.720 align:start position:0%
greatest and broadest reach for the most
 
02:53:18.950 --> 02:53:18.960 align:start position:0%
educators in the state
 
02:53:19.990 --> 02:53:20.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:53:22.870 --> 02:53:22.880 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
02:53:25.750 --> 02:53:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:27.429 --> 02:53:27.439 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
02:53:29.429 --> 02:53:29.439 align:start position:0%
taking the question we heard earlier
 
02:53:31.590 --> 02:53:31.600 align:start position:0%
today about credentialing a lot of it
 
02:53:33.190 --> 02:53:33.200 align:start position:0%
being done for
 
02:53:34.790 --> 02:53:34.800 align:start position:0%
teachers not even going to teach in new
 
02:53:37.110 --> 02:53:37.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire and we have reciprocity in
 
02:53:38.469 --> 02:53:38.479 align:start position:0%
other states
 
02:53:38.479 --> 02:53:39.349 align:start position:0%
other states
that

02:53:39.349 --> 02:53:39.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:53:41.030 --> 02:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
got their credentials
 
02:53:42.309 --> 02:53:42.319 align:start position:0%
none of us
 
02:53:45.510 --> 02:53:45.520 align:start position:0%
so why would this not be really when a
 
02:53:48.790 --> 02:53:48.800 align:start position:0%
teacher first applies to a school
 
02:53:50.830 --> 02:53:50.840 align:start position:0%
that they then have
 
02:53:53.990 --> 02:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
to read up and know know the laws rather
 
02:53:56.550 --> 02:53:56.560 align:start position:0%
than at the credentialing
 
02:53:57.750 --> 02:53:57.760 align:start position:0%
they don't even know where they're going
 
02:54:00.070 --> 02:54:00.080 align:start position:0%
to teach at and either the reciprocity
 
02:54:06.469 --> 02:54:06.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:07.510 --> 02:54:07.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question i'm just
 
02:54:09.269 --> 02:54:09.279 align:start position:0%
trying to think about what you're asking
 
02:54:10.950 --> 02:54:10.960 align:start position:0%
um i apologize
 
02:54:10.960 --> 02:54:13.110 align:start position:0%
um i apologize
uh

02:54:13.110 --> 02:54:13.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:54:15.830 --> 02:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
so reciprocity is a term just as a side
 
02:54:18.070 --> 02:54:18.080 align:start position:0%
note is a term that's used uh in
 
02:54:20.389 --> 02:54:20.399 align:start position:0%
credentialing around the country
 
02:54:23.349 --> 02:54:23.359 align:start position:0%
by state departments of education and in
 
02:54:25.510 --> 02:54:25.520 align:start position:0%
practice there's actually very little
 
02:54:27.670 --> 02:54:27.680 align:start position:0%
one-to-one reciprocity
 
02:54:29.910 --> 02:54:29.920 align:start position:0%
there's almost zero instances where
 
02:54:31.269 --> 02:54:31.279 align:start position:0%
someone comes to new hampshire with a
 
02:54:32.630 --> 02:54:32.640 align:start position:0%
teacher license
 
02:54:35.269 --> 02:54:35.279 align:start position:0%
or a principal license hands it to us
 
02:54:37.670 --> 02:54:37.680 align:start position:0%
and we immediately hand back to them a
 
02:54:40.550 --> 02:54:40.560 align:start position:0%
local license of comparable nature
 
02:54:43.269 --> 02:54:43.279 align:start position:0%
what reciprocity does is it makes it
 
02:54:44.790 --> 02:54:44.800 align:start position:0%
easier for teachers to move between
 
02:54:46.630 --> 02:54:46.640 align:start position:0%
states but it's not a one for one i
 
02:54:48.150 --> 02:54:48.160 align:start position:0%
think an example was given before of
 
02:54:50.070 --> 02:54:50.080 align:start position:0%
real estate or you know there's other
 
02:54:52.150 --> 02:54:52.160 align:start position:0%
licensing bodies so
 
02:54:54.630 --> 02:54:54.640 align:start position:0%
as it stands today that
 
02:54:56.630 --> 02:54:56.640 align:start position:0%
that reciprocity occurs but there's
 
02:54:58.070 --> 02:54:58.080 align:start position:0%
oversight by the department of the
 
02:54:59.670 --> 02:54:59.680 align:start position:0%
incoming educator
 
02:55:01.590 --> 02:55:01.600 align:start position:0%
so that educators transcript and
 
02:55:03.670 --> 02:55:03.680 align:start position:0%
qualifications are reviewed to meet our
 
02:55:05.510 --> 02:55:05.520 align:start position:0%
standards and
 
02:55:05.520 --> 02:55:07.590 align:start position:0%
standards and
so

02:55:07.590 --> 02:55:07.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:55:09.190 --> 02:55:09.200 align:start position:0%
if in fact an educator came here from
 
02:55:11.750 --> 02:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
another state and this was the law
 
02:55:13.750 --> 02:55:13.760 align:start position:0%
one of the requirements would be
 
02:55:16.790 --> 02:55:16.800 align:start position:0%
they would need to take this class
 
02:55:19.349 --> 02:55:19.359 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if i answered your question
 
02:55:21.910 --> 02:55:21.920 align:start position:0%
yeah just follow up but who would be
 
02:55:26.230 --> 02:55:26.240 align:start position:0%
giving this class i guess is the point
 
02:55:29.750 --> 02:55:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:31.830 --> 02:55:31.840 align:start position:0%
in almost every instance if a
 
02:55:34.150 --> 02:55:34.160 align:start position:0%
requirement isn't met it's one of our
 
02:55:35.510 --> 02:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
institutions of higher education that
 
02:55:37.030 --> 02:55:37.040 align:start position:0%
delivers the class
 
02:55:39.349 --> 02:55:39.359 align:start position:0%
either as a certificate or a four-credit
 
02:55:39.359 --> 02:55:41.750 align:start position:0%
either as a certificate or a four-credit
class

02:55:41.750 --> 02:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:45.110 --> 02:55:45.120 align:start position:0%
representative and then representative
 
02:55:46.870 --> 02:55:46.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr thank you for being here
 
02:55:49.830 --> 02:55:49.840 align:start position:0%
and taking our questions uh
 
02:55:52.309 --> 02:55:52.319 align:start position:0%
i sometimes have to get a license uh
 
02:55:55.510 --> 02:55:55.520 align:start position:0%
when we rent in lake winnipesaukee uh to
 
02:55:58.150 --> 02:55:58.160 align:start position:0%
have a boat license for two weeks and
 
02:56:00.710 --> 02:56:00.720 align:start position:0%
there's a body of knowledge a hand out a
 
02:56:03.110 --> 02:56:03.120 align:start position:0%
booklet of stuff that i or people like
 
02:56:05.590 --> 02:56:05.600 align:start position:0%
myself who want that license temporary
 
02:56:08.309 --> 02:56:08.319 align:start position:0%
license need to study we take the exam
 
02:56:10.230 --> 02:56:10.240 align:start position:0%
assessment online so we keep hearing
 
02:56:13.030 --> 02:56:13.040 align:start position:0%
about a course or a class
 
02:56:15.590 --> 02:56:15.600 align:start position:0%
is there some way that this requirement
 
02:56:18.150 --> 02:56:18.160 align:start position:0%
perhaps could be met by a simple
 
02:56:20.469 --> 02:56:20.479 align:start position:0%
um online
 
02:56:20.479 --> 02:56:21.670 align:start position:0%
um online
assessment

02:56:21.670 --> 02:56:21.680 align:start position:0%
assessment
 
02:56:23.750 --> 02:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
whereby the people are given the body of
 
02:56:25.670 --> 02:56:25.680 align:start position:0%
knowledge they need to learn and then
 
02:56:27.830 --> 02:56:27.840 align:start position:0%
they sign in and take it online as
 
02:56:29.910 --> 02:56:29.920 align:start position:0%
opposed to a class or a course that you
 
02:56:32.630 --> 02:56:32.640 align:start position:0%
keep describing
 
02:56:34.950 --> 02:56:34.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
02:56:37.030 --> 02:56:37.040 align:start position:0%
i don't see why not
 
02:56:39.510 --> 02:56:39.520 align:start position:0%
is the short answer i mean the the bill
 
02:56:42.150 --> 02:56:42.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't speak to who would develop that
 
02:56:44.550 --> 02:56:44.560 align:start position:0%
um how we would administer an assessment
 
02:56:46.070 --> 02:56:46.080 align:start position:0%
there would be a cost associated with
 
02:56:47.190 --> 02:56:47.200 align:start position:0%
that so there are
 
02:56:48.870 --> 02:56:48.880 align:start position:0%
a number of pieces but i
 
02:56:51.990 --> 02:56:52.000 align:start position:0%
i don't see why that couldn't be done
 
02:56:52.870 --> 02:56:52.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:56:52.880 --> 02:56:56.150 align:start position:0%
thank you
representative

02:56:56.150 --> 02:56:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:58.790 --> 02:56:58.800 align:start position:0%
thanks uh thanks very much and and um
 
02:57:01.670 --> 02:57:01.680 align:start position:0%
uh question is really to uh to dr green
 
02:57:04.550 --> 02:57:04.560 align:start position:0%
um you had you had suggested
 
02:57:07.349 --> 02:57:07.359 align:start position:0%
during your testimony that um
 
02:57:09.590 --> 02:57:09.600 align:start position:0%
that in particular
 
02:57:11.510 --> 02:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
uh lower um
 
02:57:14.070 --> 02:57:14.080 align:start position:0%
low-performing schools may uh may see a
 
02:57:17.590 --> 02:57:17.600 align:start position:0%
benefit by by having um
 
02:57:20.309 --> 02:57:20.319 align:start position:0%
a program like this in place and it
 
02:57:23.269 --> 02:57:23.279 align:start position:0%
would allow teachers to sort of examine
 
02:57:25.590 --> 02:57:25.600 align:start position:0%
um what their boundaries are and and
 
02:57:28.230 --> 02:57:28.240 align:start position:0%
think a little more outside the box
 
02:57:30.630 --> 02:57:30.640 align:start position:0%
and i just wanted if if you could sort
 
02:57:33.510 --> 02:57:33.520 align:start position:0%
of expand on what you meant by
 
02:57:35.750 --> 02:57:35.760 align:start position:0%
low performing schools do you mean like
 
02:57:41.110 --> 02:57:41.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:42.550 --> 02:57:42.560 align:start position:0%
sure i think there's probably a variety
 
02:57:44.309 --> 02:57:44.319 align:start position:0%
of different ways of looking at that so
 
02:57:45.750 --> 02:57:45.760 align:start position:0%
you could look at it from a resource
 
02:57:47.910 --> 02:57:47.920 align:start position:0%
perspective so school districts that say
 
02:57:49.590 --> 02:57:49.600 align:start position:0%
are struggling to use the resources that
 
02:57:51.590 --> 02:57:51.600 align:start position:0%
they have available to them could find
 
02:57:53.190 --> 02:57:53.200 align:start position:0%
ways of administering the minimum
 
02:57:54.630 --> 02:57:54.640 align:start position:0%
standards in different ways that would
 
02:57:57.110 --> 02:57:57.120 align:start position:0%
maximize their local resources
 
02:57:58.710 --> 02:57:58.720 align:start position:0%
or you could look at it from an academic
 
02:58:00.550 --> 02:58:00.560 align:start position:0%
and an assessment perspective
 
02:58:03.269 --> 02:58:03.279 align:start position:0%
so school districts that have students
 
02:58:04.790 --> 02:58:04.800 align:start position:0%
or subgroups of their students that are
 
02:58:06.950 --> 02:58:06.960 align:start position:0%
performing low on the state assessment
 
02:58:08.389 --> 02:58:08.399 align:start position:0%
may look at different ways that they
 
02:58:10.230 --> 02:58:10.240 align:start position:0%
could administer those same minimum
 
02:58:11.910 --> 02:58:11.920 align:start position:0%
standards in order to reach their
 
02:58:13.590 --> 02:58:13.600 align:start position:0%
students or provide instruction in a
 
02:58:15.110 --> 02:58:15.120 align:start position:0%
different manner
 
02:58:17.830 --> 02:58:17.840 align:start position:0%
in a follow-up yeah for sure um so
 
02:58:19.349 --> 02:58:19.359 align:start position:0%
thanks so um
 
02:58:23.349 --> 02:58:23.359 align:start position:0%
so just um just to follow up on that
 
02:58:25.830 --> 02:58:25.840 align:start position:0%
um there's a there's there's a pretty
 
02:58:25.840 --> 02:58:26.790 align:start position:0%
um there's a there's there's a pretty
clear

02:58:26.790 --> 02:58:26.800 align:start position:0%
clear
 
02:58:30.070 --> 02:58:30.080 align:start position:0%
connection between um um
 
02:58:32.469 --> 02:58:32.479 align:start position:0%
free and reduced price lunch populations
 
02:58:36.550 --> 02:58:36.560 align:start position:0%
or density and um and and student
 
02:58:37.910 --> 02:58:37.920 align:start position:0%
student outcomes
 
02:58:37.920 --> 02:58:39.110 align:start position:0%
student outcomes
and

02:58:39.110 --> 02:58:39.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:58:42.230 --> 02:58:42.240 align:start position:0%
just trying to you know wonder wondering
 
02:58:42.240 --> 02:58:43.110 align:start position:0%
just trying to you know wonder wondering
how

02:58:43.110 --> 02:58:43.120 align:start position:0%
how
 
02:58:43.120 --> 02:58:44.389 align:start position:0%
how
how

02:58:44.389 --> 02:58:44.399 align:start position:0%
how
 
02:58:46.309 --> 02:58:46.319 align:start position:0%
maybe a more concrete knowledge of the
 
02:58:49.670 --> 02:58:49.680 align:start position:0%
rules would uh would would would somehow
 
02:58:51.110 --> 02:58:51.120 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
02:58:53.110 --> 02:58:53.120 align:start position:0%
positively impact
 
02:58:55.110 --> 02:58:55.120 align:start position:0%
uh those schools with high free and
 
02:59:02.469 --> 02:59:02.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:04.309 --> 02:59:04.319 align:start position:0%
yeah you're putting me on the spot here
 
02:59:05.910 --> 02:59:05.920 align:start position:0%
well that's what
 
02:59:07.510 --> 02:59:07.520 align:start position:0%
that's what being a witness is all about
 
02:59:07.520 --> 02:59:08.469 align:start position:0%
that's what being a witness is all about
um

02:59:08.469 --> 02:59:08.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:59:09.990 --> 02:59:10.000 align:start position:0%
i can give you one example this is
 
02:59:11.910 --> 02:59:11.920 align:start position:0%
something that you know we've looked at
 
02:59:13.990 --> 02:59:14.000 align:start position:0%
with a couple of administrators that
 
02:59:15.429 --> 02:59:15.439 align:start position:0%
have looked to some other states that
 
02:59:17.590 --> 02:59:17.600 align:start position:0%
have gotten creative with their school
 
02:59:19.590 --> 02:59:19.600 align:start position:0%
calendars and the way that they schedule
 
02:59:21.750 --> 02:59:21.760 align:start position:0%
their days
 
02:59:23.269 --> 02:59:23.279 align:start position:0%
when you look at the minimum standards
 
02:59:25.030 --> 02:59:25.040 align:start position:0%
themselves we have a variety of
 
02:59:26.950 --> 02:59:26.960 align:start position:0%
different ways of
 
02:59:28.630 --> 02:59:28.640 align:start position:0%
measuring out our school calendar year
 
02:59:31.349 --> 02:59:31.359 align:start position:0%
you can do a school year is 180 days or
 
02:59:32.790 --> 02:59:32.800 align:start position:0%
you can look at it as a certain number
 
02:59:35.030 --> 02:59:35.040 align:start position:0%
of instructional hours and that's a
 
02:59:37.510 --> 02:59:37.520 align:start position:0%
minimum that the schools are required to
 
02:59:37.520 --> 02:59:39.030 align:start position:0%
minimum that the schools are required to
provide

02:59:39.030 --> 02:59:39.040 align:start position:0%
provide
 
02:59:41.510 --> 02:59:41.520 align:start position:0%
and rather than going for 100 what many
 
02:59:42.710 --> 02:59:42.720 align:start position:0%
of our schools do is they look at that
 
02:59:44.469 --> 02:59:44.479 align:start position:0%
180 days and then they look at the
 
02:59:45.750 --> 02:59:45.760 align:start position:0%
length of their day and they try to make
 
02:59:46.870 --> 02:59:46.880 align:start position:0%
sure that they're measuring the length
 
02:59:48.469 --> 02:59:48.479 align:start position:0%
of the day so that by the time they get
 
02:59:50.710 --> 02:59:50.720 align:start position:0%
to the end of 180 days they've met those
 
02:59:52.230 --> 02:59:52.240 align:start position:0%
hours requirements
 
02:59:54.389 --> 02:59:54.399 align:start position:0%
there's a variety of other creative ways
 
02:59:55.990 --> 02:59:56.000 align:start position:0%
that you might schedule that out while
 
02:59:58.150 --> 02:59:58.160 align:start position:0%
still meeting the hours requirement of
 
02:59:59.750 --> 02:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
the minimum standards but not
 
03:00:02.230 --> 03:00:02.240 align:start position:0%
necessarily the 180 days that might
 
03:00:03.910 --> 03:00:03.920 align:start position:0%
provide more flexibility for different
 
03:00:06.469 --> 03:00:06.479 align:start position:0%
populations of students in a district
 
03:00:09.030 --> 03:00:09.040 align:start position:0%
so as one example that's a way that a
 
03:00:10.710 --> 03:00:10.720 align:start position:0%
school district could get creative using
 
03:00:12.389 --> 03:00:12.399 align:start position:0%
the minimum standards while still
 
03:00:13.670 --> 03:00:13.680 align:start position:0%
meeting the regulations that they're
 
03:00:15.910 --> 03:00:15.920 align:start position:0%
required to
 
03:00:17.030 --> 03:00:17.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:00:18.630 --> 03:00:18.640 align:start position:0%
representative ellison
 
03:00:20.550 --> 03:00:20.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thanks for taking my
 
03:00:22.630 --> 03:00:22.640 align:start position:0%
questions real quick question did the
 
03:00:24.389 --> 03:00:24.399 align:start position:0%
department request that this bill be
 
03:00:24.399 --> 03:00:29.750 align:start position:0%
department request that this bill be
filed

03:00:29.750 --> 03:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:29.760 --> 03:00:30.950 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:00:30.950 --> 03:00:30.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:00:33.510 --> 03:00:33.520 align:start position:0%
frankly i i don't know um representative
 
03:00:35.910 --> 03:00:35.920 align:start position:0%
canadian reached out and asked uh for
 
03:00:37.670 --> 03:00:37.680 align:start position:0%
department to come and answer questions
 
03:00:39.910 --> 03:00:39.920 align:start position:0%
okay so thank you thank you are there
 
03:00:41.990 --> 03:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
03:00:44.710 --> 03:00:44.720 align:start position:0%
uh i just have one myself it would it be
 
03:00:46.630 --> 03:00:46.640 align:start position:0%
i'll get you a second rick for zen like
 
03:00:48.150 --> 03:00:48.160 align:start position:0%
like us
 
03:00:48.160 --> 03:00:49.510 align:start position:0%
like us
um

03:00:49.510 --> 03:00:49.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:00:50.950 --> 03:00:50.960 align:start position:0%
knowing that
 
03:00:52.710 --> 03:00:52.720 align:start position:0%
i brought this in today not because of
 
03:00:54.630 --> 03:00:54.640 align:start position:0%
this bill because i have to reference it
 
03:00:57.510 --> 03:00:57.520 align:start position:0%
later on today
 
03:01:00.309 --> 03:01:00.319 align:start position:0%
and and i've certainly been here in this
 
03:01:03.590 --> 03:01:03.600 align:start position:0%
house 14 years in the capacity on the
 
03:01:05.590 --> 03:01:05.600 align:start position:0%
education committee and i still have to
 
03:01:08.230 --> 03:01:08.240 align:start position:0%
go to it to reference
 
03:01:10.550 --> 03:01:10.560 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be wiser rather than saying
 
03:01:12.070 --> 03:01:12.080 align:start position:0%
we're going to give you another rope
 
03:01:14.870 --> 03:01:14.880 align:start position:0%
test and just regurgitate back to us
 
03:01:16.710 --> 03:01:16.720 align:start position:0%
information that's might be in here
 
03:01:19.269 --> 03:01:19.279 align:start position:0%
regarding how you operate a kitchen in a
 
03:01:19.279 --> 03:01:20.630 align:start position:0%
regarding how you operate a kitchen in a
school

03:01:20.630 --> 03:01:20.640 align:start position:0%
school
 
03:01:23.269 --> 03:01:23.279 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't it be more important for
 
03:01:23.279 --> 03:01:24.389 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't it be more important for
the

03:01:24.389 --> 03:01:24.399 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:01:26.469 --> 03:01:26.479 align:start position:0%
new certified licensed person in our
 
03:01:28.070 --> 03:01:28.080 align:start position:0%
state to come in say we have these
 
03:01:29.830 --> 03:01:29.840 align:start position:0%
statutes here here's where you can go
 
03:01:30.790 --> 03:01:30.800 align:start position:0%
find them
 
03:01:33.750 --> 03:01:33.760 align:start position:0%
we have rules which govern what you're
 
03:01:35.510 --> 03:01:35.520 align:start position:0%
going to be what what areas she should
 
03:01:39.110 --> 03:01:39.120 align:start position:0%
be covering in a a science class in high
 
03:01:39.120 --> 03:01:39.990 align:start position:0%
be covering in a a science class in high
school

03:01:39.990 --> 03:01:40.000 align:start position:0%
school
 
03:01:42.870 --> 03:01:42.880 align:start position:0%
and specifically various areas
 
03:01:45.110 --> 03:01:45.120 align:start position:0%
here's where you go to reference it
 
03:01:47.830 --> 03:01:47.840 align:start position:0%
rather than having to regurgitate i
 
03:01:49.670 --> 03:01:49.680 align:start position:0%
don't know how you would ever
 
03:01:53.030 --> 03:01:53.040 align:start position:0%
develop any kind of an assessment
 
03:01:56.710 --> 03:01:56.720 align:start position:0%
of of this plus everything else
 
03:01:58.790 --> 03:01:58.800 align:start position:0%
isn't just wiser that we
 
03:02:01.429 --> 03:02:01.439 align:start position:0%
teach or ask of our teachers
 
03:02:03.190 --> 03:02:03.200 align:start position:0%
and our administrators and all those
 
03:02:05.349 --> 03:02:05.359 align:start position:0%
working that you know where to go to get
 
03:02:10.469 --> 03:02:10.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:12.309 --> 03:02:12.319 align:start position:0%
i i think the one thing that i would say
 
03:02:15.190 --> 03:02:15.200 align:start position:0%
and i i agree with you um chairman
 
03:02:17.990 --> 03:02:18.000 align:start position:0%
the the importance is around
 
03:02:19.510 --> 03:02:19.520 align:start position:0%
an understanding and a knowledge and
 
03:02:21.429 --> 03:02:21.439 align:start position:0%
familiarity that the minimum standards
 
03:02:23.190 --> 03:02:23.200 align:start position:0%
are there that they exist that they
 
03:02:24.630 --> 03:02:24.640 align:start position:0%
govern the operation of a school
 
03:02:27.670 --> 03:02:27.680 align:start position:0%
building so i think any way that we can
 
03:02:29.990 --> 03:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
uh get anybody that's working within our
 
03:02:31.429 --> 03:02:31.439 align:start position:0%
educational field to have an
 
03:02:33.429 --> 03:02:33.439 align:start position:0%
understanding both of the fact that the
 
03:02:35.510 --> 03:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
minimum standards exist but also where
 
03:02:37.429 --> 03:02:37.439 align:start position:0%
they are and what they do i think that's
 
03:02:38.950 --> 03:02:38.960 align:start position:0%
important i think there's a variety of
 
03:02:41.190 --> 03:02:41.200 align:start position:0%
ways of going about doing that whether
 
03:02:42.950 --> 03:02:42.960 align:start position:0%
it's a course whether it's a test
 
03:02:45.190 --> 03:02:45.200 align:start position:0%
whether it's a webinar a workshop or a
 
03:02:48.070 --> 03:02:48.080 align:start position:0%
professional development opportunity
 
03:02:49.830 --> 03:02:49.840 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
03:02:51.910 --> 03:02:51.920 align:start position:0%
uh further questions from the committee
 
03:02:55.590 --> 03:02:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:58.309 --> 03:02:58.319 align:start position:0%
do you know that the teacher colleges in
 
03:03:00.710 --> 03:03:00.720 align:start position:0%
new hampshire aren't doing this already
 
03:03:00.720 --> 03:03:01.510 align:start position:0%
new hampshire aren't doing this already
because

03:03:01.510 --> 03:03:01.520 align:start position:0%
because
 
03:03:03.030 --> 03:03:03.040 align:start position:0%
i know when i went that was my
 
03:03:04.710 --> 03:03:04.720 align:start position:0%
understanding that that was part of the
 
03:03:04.720 --> 03:03:06.630 align:start position:0%
understanding that that was part of the
program

03:03:06.630 --> 03:03:06.640 align:start position:0%
program
 
03:03:08.630 --> 03:03:08.640 align:start position:0%
in general and
 
03:03:10.790 --> 03:03:10.800 align:start position:0%
i mean have you actually checked on that
 
03:03:13.750 --> 03:03:13.760 align:start position:0%
to know that that's not happening
 
03:03:14.550 --> 03:03:14.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
03:03:15.930 --> 03:03:15.940 align:start position:0%
representative of the
 
03:03:15.940 --> 03:03:17.349 align:start position:0%
representative of the
[Music]

03:03:17.349 --> 03:03:17.359 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:03:18.790 --> 03:03:18.800 align:start position:0%
uh five
 
03:03:21.349 --> 03:03:21.359 align:start position:0%
institutions that i spoke with
 
03:03:22.630 --> 03:03:22.640 align:start position:0%
they're not
 
03:03:22.640 --> 03:03:23.990 align:start position:0%
they're not
so

03:03:23.990 --> 03:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:03:25.910 --> 03:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
one at a very high level points out the
 
03:03:27.590 --> 03:03:27.600 align:start position:0%
website and talks about minimum
 
03:03:28.870 --> 03:03:28.880 align:start position:0%
standards but there is no real
 
03:03:28.880 --> 03:03:30.710 align:start position:0%
standards but there is no real
discussion

03:03:30.710 --> 03:03:30.720 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
03:03:32.950 --> 03:03:32.960 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
03:03:35.190 --> 03:03:35.200 align:start position:0%

president of new hampshire um we're here
 
03:04:02.790 --> 03:04:02.800 align:start position:0%
in opposition to this bill i had a lot
 
03:04:04.309 --> 03:04:04.319 align:start position:0%
of questions that were written down but
 
03:04:05.510 --> 03:04:05.520 align:start position:0%
i think everybody here asked them
 
03:04:07.670 --> 03:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
already so we won't go through them
 
03:04:09.429 --> 03:04:09.439 align:start position:0%
again so that's all
 
03:04:11.190 --> 03:04:11.200 align:start position:0%

pretty much shot yeah
 
03:04:52.630 --> 03:04:52.640 align:start position:0%
and let's do that again because someone
 
03:04:57.590 --> 03:04:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:59.830 --> 04:06:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:02.229 --> 04:07:02.239 align:start position:0%
the information of everybody here that
 
04:07:06.710 --> 04:07:06.720 align:start position:0%

yeah

04:07:07.510 --> 04:07:07.520 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:07:10.150 --> 04:07:10.160 align:start position:0%
representative moffat was kind enough to
 
04:07:11.750 --> 04:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
reach up with his height and all to
 
04:07:13.269 --> 04:07:13.279 align:start position:0%

and look at the
 
04:07:26.229 --> 04:07:26.239 align:start position:0%
first uh bill coming up this afternoon
 
04:07:28.229 --> 04:07:28.239 align:start position:0%

04:07:43.110 --> 04:07:43.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:45.349 --> 04:07:45.359 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and representative
 
04:07:47.349 --> 04:07:47.359 align:start position:0%
of education
 
04:07:49.670 --> 04:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
this bill remember last year for those
 
04:07:51.189 --> 04:07:51.199 align:start position:0%
who weren't here
 
04:07:53.510 --> 04:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
we had a bill last year from the omnibus
 
04:07:56.870 --> 04:07:56.880 align:start position:0%
bill from the senate stuck in it
 
04:08:00.149 --> 04:08:00.159 align:start position:0%
and we didn't we learned then
 
04:08:02.630 --> 04:08:02.640 align:start position:0%
that using coach buses
 
04:08:05.349 --> 04:08:05.359 align:start position:0%
for travel was actually illegal
 
04:08:07.349 --> 04:08:07.359 align:start position:0%
even though everybody remembers using
 
04:08:09.510 --> 04:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
them forever
 
04:08:09.520 --> 04:08:11.269 align:start position:0%
them forever
um

04:08:11.269 --> 04:08:11.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:08:13.510 --> 04:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
we got hung up last year on the mileage
 
04:08:15.510 --> 04:08:15.520 align:start position:0%
requirement that was in the bill the
 
04:08:17.510 --> 04:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
origin original bill from the senate had
 
04:08:20.309 --> 04:08:20.319 align:start position:0%
75 miles was that was that one-way
 
04:08:20.319 --> 04:08:21.750 align:start position:0%
75 miles was that was that one-way
round-trip

04:08:21.750 --> 04:08:21.760 align:start position:0%
round-trip
 
04:08:24.309 --> 04:08:24.319 align:start position:0%
and we changed it to 150 round-trip but
 
04:08:27.910 --> 04:08:27.920 align:start position:0%
after we voted it dawned on some of us
 
04:08:29.750 --> 04:08:29.760 align:start position:0%
that we messed up
 
04:08:31.429 --> 04:08:31.439 align:start position:0%
when we rushed through bills sometimes
 
04:08:34.790 --> 04:08:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:36.950 --> 04:08:36.960 align:start position:0%
schools use coaches for a lot of trips
 
04:08:39.349 --> 04:08:39.359 align:start position:0%
less than 75 miles
 
04:08:42.229 --> 04:08:42.239 align:start position:0%
some examples school field trips
 
04:08:43.910 --> 04:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
out of state
 
04:08:45.750 --> 04:08:45.760 align:start position:0%
going to the airport
 
04:08:47.670 --> 04:08:47.680 align:start position:0%
other overnight events
 
04:08:47.680 --> 04:08:48.550 align:start position:0%
other overnight events
and

04:08:48.550 --> 04:08:48.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:08:50.550 --> 04:08:50.560 align:start position:0%
representative leon from last year she's
 
04:08:52.950 --> 04:08:52.960 align:start position:0%
on on our committee she mentioned to me
 
04:08:56.070 --> 04:08:56.080 align:start position:0%
about the londonderry marching band
 
04:08:58.070 --> 04:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
for years have gone multiple events
 
04:09:01.030 --> 04:09:01.040 align:start position:0%
including the rose bowl inaugurations
 
04:09:03.910 --> 04:09:03.920 align:start position:0%
etc they go everywhere
 
04:09:05.670 --> 04:09:05.680 align:start position:0%
with their equipment and suitcases they
 
04:09:07.750 --> 04:09:07.760 align:start position:0%
need to coach buses
 
04:09:10.630 --> 04:09:10.640 align:start position:0%
and the airport is only about 50 miles
 
04:09:12.950 --> 04:09:12.960 align:start position:0%
coach butts i went on a field trip some
 
04:09:15.429 --> 04:09:15.439 align:start position:0%
years ago to europe coach bus was needed
 
04:09:17.670 --> 04:09:17.680 align:start position:0%
to the airport other school trips
 
04:09:20.710 --> 04:09:20.720 align:start position:0%
nature's classroom etc and in most cases
 
04:09:23.110 --> 04:09:23.120 align:start position:0%
these trips are not paid by taxes
 
04:09:25.189 --> 04:09:25.199 align:start position:0%
were paid by fundraisers
 
04:09:25.199 --> 04:09:26.469 align:start position:0%
were paid by fundraisers
and

04:09:26.469 --> 04:09:26.479 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:09:28.550 --> 04:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
and fees to the to the students it will
 
04:09:30.950 --> 04:09:30.960 align:start position:0%
not be used for normal school trips
 
04:09:32.870 --> 04:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
uh one of the problems that we came out
 
04:09:32.880 --> 04:09:33.750 align:start position:0%
uh one of the problems that we came out
with

04:09:33.750 --> 04:09:33.760 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:09:36.630 --> 04:09:36.640 align:start position:0%
why it wasn't used it was of course
 
04:09:39.590 --> 04:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
uh the bus drivers background checks
 
04:09:41.429 --> 04:09:41.439 align:start position:0%
they came out well these are all field
 
04:09:43.670 --> 04:09:43.680 align:start position:0%
trips and who else is on the bus
 
04:09:46.870 --> 04:09:46.880 align:start position:0%
parents i mean chaperones and teachers
 
04:09:49.110 --> 04:09:49.120 align:start position:0%
we all had background checks and in some
 
04:09:50.790 --> 04:09:50.800 align:start position:0%
cases for example
 
04:09:53.670 --> 04:09:53.680 align:start position:0%
the trips to washington dc
 
04:09:55.429 --> 04:09:55.439 align:start position:0%
i mean how many different bus drivers
 
04:09:57.510 --> 04:09:57.520 align:start position:0%
are going to have taking the trip you
 
04:10:00.950 --> 04:10:00.960 align:start position:0%
don't know what state they're even in so
 
04:10:03.510 --> 04:10:03.520 align:start position:0%
after that was approved so last
 
04:10:05.269 --> 04:10:05.279 align:start position:0%
it was recommended that i put in the
 
04:10:09.269 --> 04:10:09.279 align:start position:0%
bill to get rid of the mileage
 
04:10:11.590 --> 04:10:11.600 align:start position:0%
proponent and if you see on the bottom
 
04:10:13.750 --> 04:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
it used to require travel at least 150
 
04:10:16.149 --> 04:10:16.159 align:start position:0%
miles round trip just taking that out
 
04:10:18.469 --> 04:10:18.479 align:start position:0%
because we know it's being used for less
 
04:10:20.870 --> 04:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
than that and there's not no really need
 
04:10:23.349 --> 04:10:23.359 align:start position:0%
for the mileage requirement and thank
 
04:10:25.349 --> 04:10:25.359 align:start position:0%
you i'll take any questions
 
04:10:26.469 --> 04:10:26.479 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from the
 
04:10:29.189 --> 04:10:29.199 align:start position:0%
committee for representative
 
04:10:31.990 --> 04:10:32.000 align:start position:0%
yes represent tanner
 
04:10:33.590 --> 04:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
thank you i'm i'm just wondering thank
 
04:10:35.830 --> 04:10:35.840 align:start position:0%
you uh for taking my question i'm just
 
04:10:37.750 --> 04:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
wondering why you added
 
04:10:39.510 --> 04:10:39.520 align:start position:0%
are approved by the school board that's
 
04:10:41.269 --> 04:10:41.279 align:start position:0%
in in dark
 
04:10:42.950 --> 04:10:42.960 align:start position:0%
and what exactly
 
04:10:44.870 --> 04:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
does that mean as far as
 
04:10:48.870 --> 04:10:48.880 align:start position:0%
what does the school district approve
 
04:10:50.790 --> 04:10:50.800 align:start position:0%
well that's already in law
 
04:10:52.630 --> 04:10:52.640 align:start position:0%
or approve are approved by the school
 
04:10:52.640 --> 04:10:54.149 align:start position:0%
or approve are approved by the school
district

04:10:54.149 --> 04:10:54.159 align:start position:0%
district
 
04:10:56.550 --> 04:10:56.560 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's printed as new in the
 
04:10:56.560 --> 04:10:57.990 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's printed as new in the
bill

04:10:57.990 --> 04:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:10:59.990 --> 04:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
maybe i'm sorry yeah but yeah if the
 
04:11:01.990 --> 04:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
school district approves it then
 
04:11:03.670 --> 04:11:03.680 align:start position:0%
if it's not in law that's what it meant
 
04:11:05.189 --> 04:11:05.199 align:start position:0%
yes how to be approved by the school
 
04:11:07.189 --> 04:11:07.199 align:start position:0%
district what are they approving
 
04:11:10.550 --> 04:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
that you can use the bus for that trip
 
04:11:12.790 --> 04:11:12.800 align:start position:0%
for that activity
 
04:11:13.990 --> 04:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
in other words
 
04:11:16.309 --> 04:11:16.319 align:start position:0%
even though i mean they like the
 
04:11:17.990 --> 04:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
londonderry marching band for example
 
04:11:19.590 --> 04:11:19.600 align:start position:0%
they can't just go out and hide the bus
 
04:11:21.110 --> 04:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
it's got to be approved by the school
 
04:11:21.120 --> 04:11:25.189 align:start position:0%
it's got to be approved by the school
district

04:11:25.189 --> 04:11:25.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:26.870 --> 04:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
so so
 
04:11:28.550 --> 04:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
if i may have a follow-up yes go ahead
 
04:11:30.389 --> 04:11:30.399 align:start position:0%
thank you so
 
04:11:32.550 --> 04:11:32.560 align:start position:0%
not to make this too complicated because
 
04:11:34.630 --> 04:11:34.640 align:start position:0%
it i agree that the mileage should be
 
04:11:37.349 --> 04:11:37.359 align:start position:0%
increased okay that that's fine i'm just
 
04:11:39.269 --> 04:11:39.279 align:start position:0%
wondering um
 
04:11:40.309 --> 04:11:40.319 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:11:43.110 --> 04:11:43.120 align:start position:0%
when i've when i've done sports or field
 
04:11:44.950 --> 04:11:44.960 align:start position:0%
trips or anything like that and we've
 
04:11:47.830 --> 04:11:47.840 align:start position:0%
we've gotten uh you know a bus a big bus
 
04:11:49.429 --> 04:11:49.439 align:start position:0%
like you said it happens
 
04:11:49.439 --> 04:11:51.510 align:start position:0%
like you said it happens
um

04:11:51.510 --> 04:11:51.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:11:54.309 --> 04:11:54.319 align:start position:0%
a lot of times the school pays for it
 
04:11:56.790 --> 04:11:56.800 align:start position:0%
uh sometimes sometimes the kids raise
 
04:11:57.910 --> 04:11:57.920 align:start position:0%
the money
 
04:12:00.389 --> 04:12:00.399 align:start position:0%
to get to get the bus
 
04:12:00.399 --> 04:12:01.429 align:start position:0%
to get to get the bus
so

04:12:01.429 --> 04:12:01.439 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:12:03.750 --> 04:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
the approval by the school district
 
04:12:03.760 --> 04:12:04.469 align:start position:0%
the approval by the school district
so

04:12:04.469 --> 04:12:04.479 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:12:06.389 --> 04:12:06.399 align:start position:0%
like a
 
04:12:08.870 --> 04:12:08.880 align:start position:0%
group that represents the school
 
04:12:10.790 --> 04:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
couldn't just go out and raise money
 
04:12:12.790 --> 04:12:12.800 align:start position:0%
hire the bus and not go through the
 
04:12:14.389 --> 04:12:14.399 align:start position:0%
school board
 
04:12:16.070 --> 04:12:16.080 align:start position:0%
i mean everything i mean the school
 
04:12:17.510 --> 04:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
district that's why it does school board
 
04:12:19.110 --> 04:12:19.120 align:start position:0%
school district right
 
04:12:20.550 --> 04:12:20.560 align:start position:0%
i mean it's
 
04:12:22.790 --> 04:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
everything got to be approved somewhere
 
04:12:25.269 --> 04:12:25.279 align:start position:0%
i mean you can't just go uh a classroom
 
04:12:27.030 --> 04:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
can't just say hey we're going to go
 
04:12:28.790 --> 04:12:28.800 align:start position:0%
here and we'll get a bus
 
04:12:30.950 --> 04:12:30.960 align:start position:0%
it's all got to be somebody's got to
 
04:12:32.550 --> 04:12:32.560 align:start position:0%
approve it
 
04:12:33.830 --> 04:12:33.840 align:start position:0%
so it's got to go up the line and
 
04:12:36.790 --> 04:12:36.800 align:start position:0%
somebody got to know about it
 
04:12:38.389 --> 04:12:38.399 align:start position:0%
represent boom i have a question it's a
 
04:12:41.349 --> 04:12:41.359 align:start position:0%
follow-up to that line of thinking
 
04:12:43.349 --> 04:12:43.359 align:start position:0%
would it be wise to put a period after
 
04:12:43.359 --> 04:12:48.149 align:start position:0%
would it be wise to put a period after
services

04:12:48.149 --> 04:12:48.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:50.309 --> 04:12:50.319 align:start position:0%
and we're in special education
 
04:12:55.349 --> 04:12:55.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:55.359 --> 04:12:56.790 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:12:56.790 --> 04:12:56.800 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:12:58.790 --> 04:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
if we want to make that amendment
 
04:13:01.429 --> 04:13:01.439 align:start position:0%
well i've just asked maybe uh
 
04:13:03.349 --> 04:13:03.359 align:start position:0%
in you know future
 
04:13:04.950 --> 04:13:04.960 align:start position:0%
committee to be here they may be able
 
04:13:06.309 --> 04:13:06.319 align:start position:0%
are questioning they might be able to
 
04:13:08.550 --> 04:13:08.560 align:start position:0%
further that but that would be you know
 
04:13:11.030 --> 04:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
something i asked and for you to think

again miss fenton um
 
04:15:46.790 --> 04:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
the um uh
 
04:15:49.750 --> 04:15:49.760 align:start position:0%
when when we uh discussed this uh a
 
04:15:51.750 --> 04:15:51.760 align:start position:0%
similar uh bill
 
04:15:53.990 --> 04:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
last year i know there were a number of
 
04:15:56.550 --> 04:15:56.560 align:start position:0%
concerns i think that brought that that
 
04:15:58.870 --> 04:15:58.880 align:start position:0%
um sort of followed along the lines of
 
04:16:00.790 --> 04:16:00.800 align:start position:0%
of student safety
 
04:16:03.830 --> 04:16:03.840 align:start position:0%
and given the fact that that
 
04:16:05.830 --> 04:16:05.840 align:start position:0%
two of the bills this morning
 
04:16:08.309 --> 04:16:08.319 align:start position:0%
that we heard um and that you testified
 
04:16:09.349 --> 04:16:09.359 align:start position:0%
on were
 
04:16:11.910 --> 04:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
focused squarely on student safety both
 
04:16:14.630 --> 04:16:14.640 align:start position:0%
from a criminal background checks in for
 
04:16:15.990 --> 04:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
an employment but also criminal
 
04:16:19.189 --> 04:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
background check for um for licensing
 
04:16:22.149 --> 04:16:22.159 align:start position:0%
uh are there does does
 
04:16:24.630 --> 04:16:24.640 align:start position:0%
the provision that's in roman 2 the
 
04:16:26.870 --> 04:16:26.880 align:start position:0%
proposed provision in roman 2
 
04:16:28.389 --> 04:16:28.399 align:start position:0%
with or without the
 
04:16:31.670 --> 04:16:31.680 align:start position:0%
the part of the sentence that that
 
04:16:34.950 --> 04:16:34.960 align:start position:0%
are approved by the school district
 
04:16:38.469 --> 04:16:38.479 align:start position:0%
does does that bring up any
 
04:16:41.510 --> 04:16:41.520 align:start position:0%
either concerns or responsibilities
 
04:16:44.790 --> 04:16:44.800 align:start position:0%
as far as student safety on on
 
04:16:48.630 --> 04:16:48.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:50.469 --> 04:16:50.479 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question just for the
 
04:16:52.149 --> 04:16:52.159 align:start position:0%
record my name is dianna fenton i'm an
 
04:16:53.189 --> 04:16:53.199 align:start position:0%
attorney with the department of
 
04:16:53.199 --> 04:16:54.309 align:start position:0%
attorney with the department of
education

04:16:54.309 --> 04:16:54.319 align:start position:0%
education
 
04:16:56.710 --> 04:16:56.720 align:start position:0%
i appreciate the question and the short
 
04:16:59.030 --> 04:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
answer is i would have to i will have to
 
04:17:00.710 --> 04:17:00.720 align:start position:0%
get back to you i have to think about it
 
04:17:03.189 --> 04:17:03.199 align:start position:0%
in the in the broader context um when we
 
04:17:05.030 --> 04:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
look at contract carriers they are
 
04:17:06.790 --> 04:17:06.800 align:start position:0%
private entities they are private
 
04:17:10.149 --> 04:17:10.159 align:start position:0%
company um so they would fall under a
 
04:17:12.229 --> 04:17:12.239 align:start position:0%
contract service
 
04:17:17.910 --> 04:17:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:20.790 --> 04:17:20.800 align:start position:0%
189 13 a as we discussed at length this
 
04:17:23.349 --> 04:17:23.359 align:start position:0%
morning deals with employee
 
04:17:25.990 --> 04:17:26.000 align:start position:0%
employment and contractors so
 
04:17:31.030 --> 04:17:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:32.950 --> 04:17:32.960 align:start position:0%
my answer is that
 
04:17:35.990 --> 04:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
as a contractor if i'm running a bus
 
04:17:38.309 --> 04:17:38.319 align:start position:0%
service and i am contracting with sau
 
04:17:39.750 --> 04:17:39.760 align:start position:0%
number one
 
04:17:41.910 --> 04:17:41.920 align:start position:0%
they would have to
 
04:17:44.070 --> 04:17:44.080 align:start position:0%
run a background check on me as i am
 
04:17:46.469 --> 04:17:46.479 align:start position:0%
contracting with them for this service
 
04:17:48.149 --> 04:17:48.159 align:start position:0%
and i think that is the umbrella of
 
04:17:51.830 --> 04:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
child safety that it would fall under
 
04:17:53.830 --> 04:17:53.840 align:start position:0%
would not fall within the department
 
04:17:55.830 --> 04:17:55.840 align:start position:0%
because we are exclusive to the school
 
04:17:55.840 --> 04:17:56.790 align:start position:0%
because we are exclusive to the school
bus

04:17:56.790 --> 04:17:56.800 align:start position:0%
bus
 
04:18:00.070 --> 04:18:00.080 align:start position:0%
um and this is just kind of a one-time
 
04:18:04.550 --> 04:18:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:06.790 --> 04:18:06.800 align:start position:0%
may i get a follow-up on that yes so
 
04:18:08.550 --> 04:18:08.560 align:start position:0%
thanks very much and uh and thank you
 
04:18:09.910 --> 04:18:09.920 align:start position:0%
for your answer
 
04:18:11.910 --> 04:18:11.920 align:start position:0%
on on that um
 
04:18:14.070 --> 04:18:14.080 align:start position:0%
uh if the
 
04:18:14.080 --> 04:18:15.910 align:start position:0%
uh if the
um

04:18:15.910 --> 04:18:15.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:18:17.110 --> 04:18:17.120 align:start position:0%
if the bill was
 
04:18:20.870 --> 04:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
not amended and it included the text are
 
04:18:23.429 --> 04:18:23.439 align:start position:0%
approved by the school district
 
04:18:27.590 --> 04:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
um would that place any additional
 
04:18:29.990 --> 04:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
fiduciary um
 
04:18:34.630 --> 04:18:34.640 align:start position:0%
uh regards i guess or considerations on
 
04:18:36.229 --> 04:18:36.239 align:start position:0%
i mean let's say the school board was
 
04:18:37.510 --> 04:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
approving it and the school board
 
04:18:40.149 --> 04:18:40.159 align:start position:0%
certainly has a fiduciary responsibility
 
04:18:41.429 --> 04:18:41.439 align:start position:0%
to um
 
04:18:41.439 --> 04:18:43.349 align:start position:0%
to um
to

04:18:43.349 --> 04:18:43.359 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:18:45.510 --> 04:18:45.520 align:start position:0%
you know the voters the taxpayers the
 
04:18:47.910 --> 04:18:47.920 align:start position:0%
residents the students you know the the
 
04:18:49.510 --> 04:18:49.520 align:start position:0%
entire school community
 
04:18:51.269 --> 04:18:51.279 align:start position:0%
um would it would it would have placed
 
04:18:53.910 --> 04:18:53.920 align:start position:0%
the school board in um in maybe an
 
04:18:53.920 --> 04:18:55.990 align:start position:0%
the school board in um in maybe an
additional

04:18:55.990 --> 04:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
additional
 
04:18:57.670 --> 04:18:57.680 align:start position:0%
position to uh
 
04:18:59.670 --> 04:18:59.680 align:start position:0%
want to inquire about uh the criminal
 
04:19:03.750 --> 04:19:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:05.349 --> 04:19:05.359 align:start position:0%
well the school board i suppose is
 
04:19:07.670 --> 04:19:07.680 align:start position:0%
certainly entitled to but
 
04:19:09.670 --> 04:19:09.680 align:start position:0%
the statute makes it clear that it is
 
04:19:11.429 --> 04:19:11.439 align:start position:0%
the superintendent that has that
 
04:19:13.990 --> 04:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
decision-making authority
 
04:19:16.229 --> 04:19:16.239 align:start position:0%
the school board will write the policy
 
04:19:18.710 --> 04:19:18.720 align:start position:0%
pursuant to to the statute but is this
 
04:19:20.630 --> 04:19:20.640 align:start position:0%
it my understanding and reading the law
 
04:19:22.469 --> 04:19:22.479 align:start position:0%
is it is the superintendent who makes
 
04:19:24.710 --> 04:19:24.720 align:start position:0%
that ultimate determination and
 
04:19:27.429 --> 04:19:27.439 align:start position:0%
recognize that superintendents do that
 
04:19:29.990 --> 04:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
decision making as it pertains to hiring
 
04:19:32.630 --> 04:19:32.640 align:start position:0%
choices and background checks
 
04:19:34.950 --> 04:19:34.960 align:start position:0%
constantly and in fact last session a
 
04:19:36.950 --> 04:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
bill was passed to allow
 
04:19:38.389 --> 04:19:38.399 align:start position:0%
superintendents i believe it might have
 
04:19:40.790 --> 04:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
been a bill that rep mullen
 
04:19:42.710 --> 04:19:42.720 align:start position:0%
sponsored a co-sponsor to allow that
 
04:19:45.189 --> 04:19:45.199 align:start position:0%
responsibility to be designated to a
 
04:19:47.110 --> 04:19:47.120 align:start position:0%
certain individual
 
04:19:48.790 --> 04:19:48.800 align:start position:0%
because it was so overwhelming but i
 
04:19:51.510 --> 04:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
think when we look at this we're looking
 
04:19:54.469 --> 04:19:54.479 align:start position:0%
at it in isolation as a bus and a bus
 
04:19:57.269 --> 04:19:57.279 align:start position:0%
driver but really the context is this is
 
04:19:58.550 --> 04:19:58.560 align:start position:0%
a contractor
 
04:20:00.469 --> 04:20:00.479 align:start position:0%
this is like any other contract service
 
04:20:03.269 --> 04:20:03.279 align:start position:0%
whether it's janitorial services or
 
04:20:05.349 --> 04:20:05.359 align:start position:0%
lunch services or bringing people in to
 
04:20:07.429 --> 04:20:07.439 align:start position:0%
fix the roof services this is a
 
04:20:11.269 --> 04:20:11.279 align:start position:0%
contractor and as such the sau would
 
04:20:12.950 --> 04:20:12.960 align:start position:0%
conduct the background check they are
 
04:20:14.790 --> 04:20:14.800 align:start position:0%
the governmental entity who would be in
 
04:20:16.550 --> 04:20:16.560 align:start position:0%
receipt of the new hampshire record and
 
04:20:18.149 --> 04:20:18.159 align:start position:0%
the fbi record
 
04:20:19.429 --> 04:20:19.439 align:start position:0%
they would
 
04:20:21.830 --> 04:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
review that record of that individual
 
04:20:24.389 --> 04:20:24.399 align:start position:0%
pursuant to the section 5 violations and
 
04:20:26.630 --> 04:20:26.640 align:start position:0%
then more importantly the district
 
04:20:29.590 --> 04:20:29.600 align:start position:0%
policy to say is this person
 
04:20:31.670 --> 04:20:31.680 align:start position:0%

and let me explain where we are in that
 
04:31:28.389 --> 04:31:28.399 align:start position:0%
uh if you were to look at the second
 
04:31:30.469 --> 04:31:30.479 align:start position:0%
sheet down going in where there's a one
 
04:31:32.870 --> 04:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
that's circled by a big circle at the
 
04:31:34.389 --> 04:31:34.399 align:start position:0%
top with my
 
04:31:34.399 --> 04:31:35.269 align:start position:0%

um
 
04:31:35.279 --> 04:31:36.070 align:start position:0%
um
my

04:31:36.070 --> 04:31:36.080 align:start position:0%
my
 
04:31:37.830 --> 04:31:37.840 align:start position:0%
penmanship at the top which i don't want
 
04:31:40.229 --> 04:31:40.239 align:start position:0%
to brag about i shouldn't
 
04:31:43.590 --> 04:31:43.600 align:start position:0%
uh this is a a bill that came in
 
04:31:45.110 --> 04:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
each year
 
04:31:47.830 --> 04:31:47.840 align:start position:0%
that we have sessions or each time each
 
04:31:50.469 --> 04:31:50.479 align:start position:0%
biennium there's always a large bill
 
04:31:53.189 --> 04:31:53.199 align:start position:0%
that comes in because this legislature
 
04:31:54.550 --> 04:31:54.560 align:start position:0%
be it if you're
 
04:31:56.630 --> 04:31:56.640 align:start position:0%
a republican or a democrat
 
04:31:58.309 --> 04:31:58.319 align:start position:0%
we're all anxious to eliminate
 
04:31:58.319 --> 04:31:59.830 align:start position:0%
we're all anxious to eliminate
legislation

04:31:59.830 --> 04:31:59.840 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
04:32:02.469 --> 04:32:02.479 align:start position:0%
that's outdated no longer has the use
 
04:32:04.870 --> 04:32:04.880 align:start position:0%
it's oftentimes relative to commissions
 
04:32:08.149 --> 04:32:08.159 align:start position:0%
committees boards task force etc
 
04:32:08.159 --> 04:32:08.950 align:start position:0%
committees boards task force etc
there

04:32:08.950 --> 04:32:08.960 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:32:11.349 --> 04:32:11.359 align:start position:0%
we have so many going on
 
04:32:13.349 --> 04:32:13.359 align:start position:0%
it's hard to find people to serve on
 
04:32:14.630 --> 04:32:14.640 align:start position:0%
these particular commissions and
 
04:32:17.910 --> 04:32:17.920 align:start position:0%
committees task force councils boards
 
04:32:17.920 --> 04:32:19.110 align:start position:0%
committees task force councils boards
etc

04:32:19.110 --> 04:32:19.120 align:start position:0%
etc
 
04:32:22.149 --> 04:32:22.159 align:start position:0%
so we go through the process
 
04:32:24.950 --> 04:32:24.960 align:start position:0%
of finding those particular areas of
 
04:32:24.960 --> 04:32:26.070 align:start position:0%
of finding those particular areas of
statute

04:32:26.070 --> 04:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
statute
 
04:32:28.870 --> 04:32:28.880 align:start position:0%
which need to be purged or deleted from
 
04:32:31.510 --> 04:32:31.520 align:start position:0%
statute you can see in this particular
 
04:32:31.520 --> 04:32:32.710 align:start position:0%
statute you can see in this particular
year

04:32:32.710 --> 04:32:32.720 align:start position:0%
year
 
04:32:35.750 --> 04:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
there's a number and i this is a this a
 
04:32:37.590 --> 04:32:37.600 align:start position:0%
this uh bill that the first one you see
 
04:32:42.710 --> 04:32:42.720 align:start position:0%
here this hb 1245 back in uh 2020
 
04:32:45.590 --> 04:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
had 12 pages to it
 
04:32:47.830 --> 04:32:47.840 align:start position:0%
one of the bills if you go to this the
 
04:32:50.070 --> 04:32:50.080 align:start position:0%
back page that first one where it says
 
04:32:51.429 --> 04:32:51.439 align:start position:0%
page 2
 
04:32:53.830 --> 04:32:53.840 align:start position:0%
and i didn't give you the other 10 pages
 
04:32:58.309 --> 04:32:58.319 align:start position:0%
you can see that rsa 193 c colon 7 and
 
04:32:58.319 --> 04:32:59.269 align:start position:0%
you can see that rsa 193 c colon 7 and

04:33:05.830 --> 04:33:05.840 align:start position:0%
were repealed
 
04:33:05.840 --> 04:33:06.629 align:start position:0%
were repealed
now

04:33:06.629 --> 04:33:06.639 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:33:09.109 --> 04:33:09.119 align:start position:0%
that statutory language
 
04:33:11.429 --> 04:33:11.439 align:start position:0%
is language pertaining to
 
04:33:13.750 --> 04:33:13.760 align:start position:0%
the statewide education improvement and
 
04:33:16.230 --> 04:33:16.240 align:start position:0%
assessment oversight committee which has
 
04:33:19.830 --> 04:33:19.840 align:start position:0%
the responsibility of overseeing our
 
04:33:22.629 --> 04:33:22.639 align:start position:0%
performance program our improvement and
 
04:33:25.029 --> 04:33:25.039 align:start position:0%
assessment program our statewide
 
04:33:26.949 --> 04:33:26.959 align:start position:0%
improvement program our statewide
 
04:33:29.109 --> 04:33:29.119 align:start position:0%
assessment program of which we haven't
 
04:33:31.590 --> 04:33:31.600 align:start position:0%
changed that statutory language
 
04:33:33.590 --> 04:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
for several years
 
04:33:33.600 --> 04:33:34.310 align:start position:0%
for several years
so

04:33:34.310 --> 04:33:34.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:33:36.789 --> 04:33:36.799 align:start position:0%
naturally that committee has not been
 
04:33:36.799 --> 04:33:37.990 align:start position:0%
naturally that committee has not been
active

04:33:37.990 --> 04:33:38.000 align:start position:0%
active
 
04:33:40.150 --> 04:33:40.160 align:start position:0%
but the need for that particular
 
04:33:43.269 --> 04:33:43.279 align:start position:0%
legislation still exists
 
04:33:45.510 --> 04:33:45.520 align:start position:0%
you can go to the very back page in this
 
04:33:50.709 --> 04:33:50.719 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:53.189 --> 04:33:53.199 align:start position:0%
and you can see a sheet that i or some
 
04:33:55.429 --> 04:33:55.439 align:start position:0%
correspondence i just recently received
 
04:33:57.429 --> 04:33:57.439 align:start position:0%
this fall
 
04:33:57.439 --> 04:33:59.029 align:start position:0%
this fall
from

04:33:59.029 --> 04:33:59.039 align:start position:0%
from
 
04:34:01.670 --> 04:34:01.680 align:start position:0%
the representative from conway
 
04:34:04.310 --> 04:34:04.320 align:start position:0%
who is on finance division two at that
 
04:34:07.349 --> 04:34:07.359 align:start position:0%
time and she was tasked this year
 
04:34:09.429 --> 04:34:09.439 align:start position:0%
to look at all at the bottom of the page
 
04:34:12.230 --> 04:34:12.240 align:start position:0%
there you can see statutory language
 
04:34:14.551 --> 04:34:14.561 align:start position:0%
referencing the advisory council of the
 
04:34:16.230 --> 04:34:16.240 align:start position:0%
education of children who had who are
 
04:34:19.029 --> 04:34:19.039 align:start position:0%
deaf or hard of hearing and on it goes
 
04:34:21.590 --> 04:34:21.600 align:start position:0%
down that list those are bills they were
 
04:34:23.670 --> 04:34:23.680 align:start position:0%
saying hey should we re
 
04:34:25.590 --> 04:34:25.600 align:start position:0%
repeal these bills should we repeal
 
04:34:27.429 --> 04:34:27.439 align:start position:0%
these areas of statute
 
04:34:29.269 --> 04:34:29.279 align:start position:0%
and of course we went down and look i
 
04:34:31.029 --> 04:34:31.039 align:start position:0%
looked at that and i also mentioned that
 
04:34:32.789 --> 04:34:32.799 align:start position:0%
several legislators wait there's some
 
04:34:34.869 --> 04:34:34.879 align:start position:0%
things here that are very useful that we
 
04:34:36.869 --> 04:34:36.879 align:start position:0%
are still using
 
04:34:39.109 --> 04:34:39.119 align:start position:0%
and maybe it's not been reflected as far
 
04:34:41.510 --> 04:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
as are used for example the
 
04:34:42.949 --> 04:34:42.959 align:start position:0%
uh if you were looking right there at
 
04:34:45.189 --> 04:34:45.199 align:start position:0%
the advanced manufacturing and education
 
04:34:47.429 --> 04:34:47.439 align:start position:0%
advisory council or the
 
04:34:47.439 --> 04:34:48.789 align:start position:0%
advisory council or the
um

04:34:48.789 --> 04:34:48.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:34:51.750 --> 04:34:51.760 align:start position:0%
going on down to uh issues that are
 
04:34:54.551 --> 04:34:54.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:56.150 --> 04:34:56.160 align:start position:0%
the task force on the math learning
 
04:34:57.830 --> 04:34:57.840 align:start position:0%
community program that's a program which
 
04:34:59.349 --> 04:34:59.359 align:start position:0%
we had with the community college system
 
04:35:01.189 --> 04:35:01.199 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire dealing with that
 
04:35:04.070 --> 04:35:04.080 align:start position:0%
dorian and it's we had 36 schools
 
04:35:06.310 --> 04:35:06.320 align:start position:0%
involved with it at the time where the
 
04:35:07.750 --> 04:35:07.760 align:start position:0%
last two years while they're in high
 
04:35:09.990 --> 04:35:10.000 align:start position:0%
school kids are getting a program that's
 
04:35:11.990 --> 04:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
more aligned to their learning teaching
 
04:35:12.000 --> 04:35:13.109 align:start position:0%
more aligned to their learning teaching
styles

04:35:13.109 --> 04:35:13.119 align:start position:0%
styles
 
04:35:16.150 --> 04:35:16.160 align:start position:0%
and for children that had difficult time
 
04:35:17.990 --> 04:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
at the end of sophomore year they were
 
04:35:20.230 --> 04:35:20.240 align:start position:0%
put in these programs and they're coming
 
04:35:22.470 --> 04:35:22.480 align:start position:0%
out better prepared for community
 
04:35:24.310 --> 04:35:24.320 align:start position:0%
college as a result of having this
 
04:35:26.470 --> 04:35:26.480 align:start position:0%
program that beth had coordinated out of
 
04:35:29.189 --> 04:35:29.199 align:start position:0%
nhti et cetera
 
04:35:31.590 --> 04:35:31.600 align:start position:0%
there's other areas there that you can
 
04:35:34.150 --> 04:35:34.160 align:start position:0%
see too that were on that list the home
 
04:35:36.629 --> 04:35:36.639 align:start position:0%
education advisory council and we know
 
04:35:36.639 --> 04:35:37.590 align:start position:0%
education advisory council and we know
that

04:35:37.590 --> 04:35:37.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:35:39.830 --> 04:35:39.840 align:start position:0%
the the person one of the persons was on
 
04:35:41.429 --> 04:35:41.439 align:start position:0%
that was barbara shaw
 
04:35:43.830 --> 04:35:43.840 align:start position:0%
and that was she saw that as we can't
 
04:35:45.990 --> 04:35:46.000 align:start position:0%
give that up right now we need to have
 
04:35:47.750 --> 04:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
that continue
 
04:35:49.429 --> 04:35:49.439 align:start position:0%
and i wrote back to karen you can see
 
04:35:51.510 --> 04:35:51.520 align:start position:0%
the top of that page that
 
04:35:53.109 --> 04:35:53.119 align:start position:0%
i will get back to you on the commission
 
04:35:54.869 --> 04:35:54.879 align:start position:0%
committees mentioned below we need to be
 
04:35:57.189 --> 04:35:57.199 align:start position:0%
careful on this for example a number of
 
04:36:00.629 --> 04:36:00.639 align:start position:0%
rsas were identified on an omnibus bill
 
04:36:03.830 --> 04:36:03.840 align:start position:0%
back in 2020 which you have before you
 
04:36:08.949 --> 04:36:08.959 align:start position:0%
and it repealed rsa 193 cn 8 7 and 8.
 
04:36:11.429 --> 04:36:11.439 align:start position:0%
that's turned into a disaster as this
 
04:36:13.830 --> 04:36:13.840 align:start position:0%
legislation was related to the new
 
04:36:15.269 --> 04:36:15.279 align:start position:0%
hampshire statewide education
 
04:36:16.789 --> 04:36:16.799 align:start position:0%
improvement and assessment oversight
 
04:36:19.269 --> 04:36:19.279 align:start position:0%
committee the oversight committee is key
 
04:36:21.910 --> 04:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
to adequacy review and needed whenever
 
04:36:24.629 --> 04:36:24.639 align:start position:0%
doe opts to modify or change academic
 
04:36:26.310 --> 04:36:26.320 align:start position:0%
standard rules
 
04:36:27.910 --> 04:36:27.920 align:start position:0%
the commissioner and i reference this
 
04:36:31.670 --> 04:36:31.680 align:start position:0%
statute when rewriting adequacy content
 
04:36:33.750 --> 04:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
following the governor's veto message
 
04:36:37.510 --> 04:36:37.520 align:start position:0%
for 242 242 as you recall was the veto
 
04:36:40.470 --> 04:36:40.480 align:start position:0%
message dealing with adequate educa
 
04:36:43.990 --> 04:36:44.000 align:start position:0%
content of inadequate education
 
04:36:46.789 --> 04:36:46.799 align:start position:0%
it had a lot more to it but it did
 
04:36:48.551 --> 04:36:48.561 align:start position:0%
regarding the costing of an adequate
 
04:36:48.561 --> 04:36:50.869 align:start position:0%
regarding the costing of an adequate
education

04:36:50.869 --> 04:36:50.879 align:start position:0%
education
 
04:36:53.910 --> 04:36:53.920 align:start position:0%
but it did reference this particular
 
04:36:55.510 --> 04:36:55.520 align:start position:0%
improvement assessment oversight
 
04:36:55.520 --> 04:36:56.789 align:start position:0%
improvement assessment oversight
committee

04:36:56.789 --> 04:36:56.799 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:36:56.799 --> 04:36:57.830 align:start position:0%
committee
but

04:36:57.830 --> 04:36:57.840 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:36:59.429 --> 04:36:59.439 align:start position:0%
we didn't know because it hadn't gone
 
04:37:01.670 --> 04:37:01.680 align:start position:0%
into statute books that had already been
 
04:37:01.680 --> 04:37:03.349 align:start position:0%
into statute books that had already been
repealed

04:37:03.349 --> 04:37:03.359 align:start position:0%
repealed
 
04:37:05.990 --> 04:37:06.000 align:start position:0%
so if we had enacted 242 there's
 
04:37:08.949 --> 04:37:08.959 align:start position:0%
reference in 242 to this committee that
 
04:37:11.029 --> 04:37:11.039 align:start position:0%
doesn't exist
 
04:37:13.109 --> 04:37:13.119 align:start position:0%
going on further
 
04:37:15.670 --> 04:37:15.680 align:start position:0%
it was quite a shock other words so we
 
04:37:18.070 --> 04:37:18.080 align:start position:0%
need to be careful i'll get back to and
 
04:37:19.830 --> 04:37:19.840 align:start position:0%
after completing some work on the 14
 
04:37:22.390 --> 04:37:22.400 align:start position:0%
identified rsas below for example the
 
04:37:24.070 --> 04:37:24.080 align:start position:0%
task force on math learning communities
 
04:37:25.910 --> 04:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
is key to the 11th and 12th grade math
 
04:37:27.830 --> 04:37:27.840 align:start position:0%
courses designed to teach matt to those
 
04:37:29.670 --> 04:37:29.680 align:start position:0%
students who have been identified as
 
04:37:31.990 --> 04:37:32.000 align:start position:0%
needing remedial support upon entering
 
04:37:33.910 --> 04:37:33.920 align:start position:0%
the community college system as you may
 
04:37:37.029 --> 04:37:37.039 align:start position:0%
recall the representative dan wolf was
 
04:37:38.551 --> 04:37:38.561 align:start position:0%
very involved with this program along
 
04:37:40.789 --> 04:37:40.799 align:start position:0%
with myself working with beth and it's
 
04:37:43.189 --> 04:37:43.199 align:start position:0%
shown remarkable gains the policy
 
04:37:46.390 --> 04:37:46.400 align:start position:0%
committee designed the program with nhti
 
04:37:49.590 --> 04:37:49.600 align:start position:0%
it goes on to say that so
 
04:37:52.150 --> 04:37:52.160 align:start position:0%
my response was let me look through this
 
04:37:53.269 --> 04:37:53.279 align:start position:0%
and i did look through it and there's
 
04:37:55.269 --> 04:37:55.279 align:start position:0%
some areas that definitely notified him
 
04:37:57.750 --> 04:37:57.760 align:start position:0%
don't mess with it uh even though it may
 
04:37:59.750 --> 04:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
not have been addressed in the last year
 
04:38:02.629 --> 04:38:02.639 align:start position:0%
certainly covet has put a lot of breaks
 
04:38:04.869 --> 04:38:04.879 align:start position:0%
on what we do in terms of subcommittee
 
04:38:07.510 --> 04:38:07.520 align:start position:0%
work committee work commission work etc
 
04:38:11.029 --> 04:38:11.039 align:start position:0%
so going back to the the you saw number
 
04:38:13.429 --> 04:38:13.439 align:start position:0%
one there but number two
 
04:38:14.949 --> 04:38:14.959 align:start position:0%
last night
 
04:38:17.429 --> 04:38:17.439 align:start position:0%
i was looking at the statutes just
 
04:38:20.150 --> 04:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
something i love to do at midnight
 
04:38:22.830 --> 04:38:22.840 align:start position:0%
but and it was midnight
 
04:38:27.109 --> 04:38:27.119 align:start position:0%
um i looked in 193 h colon 2
 
04:38:29.590 --> 04:38:29.600 align:start position:0%
which is a current statute
 
04:38:31.349 --> 04:38:31.359 align:start position:0%
you can find it in the book
 
04:38:34.230 --> 04:38:34.240 align:start position:0%
it references what the legislative
 
04:38:37.029 --> 04:38:37.039 align:start position:0%
oversight improvement and
 
04:38:39.910 --> 04:38:39.920 align:start position:0%
committee a committee on on on standards
 
04:38:41.029 --> 04:38:41.039 align:start position:0%
et cetera
 
04:38:41.039 --> 04:38:42.709 align:start position:0%
et cetera
so

04:38:42.709 --> 04:38:42.719 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:38:45.269 --> 04:38:45.279 align:start position:0%
the we we even though we evolve and of
 
04:38:47.429 --> 04:38:47.439 align:start position:0%
course if you go to number p the circle
 
04:38:48.551 --> 04:38:48.561 align:start position:0%
number three
 
04:38:49.910 --> 04:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
it tells you
 
04:38:52.390 --> 04:38:52.400 align:start position:0%
what the responsibilities and duties of
 
04:38:54.390 --> 04:38:54.400 align:start position:0%
this committee is
 
04:38:56.150 --> 04:38:56.160 align:start position:0%
it's been very helpful for us in the
 
04:38:56.160 --> 04:38:57.269 align:start position:0%
it's been very helpful for us in the
past

04:38:57.269 --> 04:38:57.279 align:start position:0%
past
 
04:38:59.670 --> 04:38:59.680 align:start position:0%
and when we went to write 242 or the
 
04:39:01.990 --> 04:39:02.000 align:start position:0%
remake of 242
 
04:39:04.310 --> 04:39:04.320 align:start position:0%
we had automatically put that in and
 
04:39:06.070 --> 04:39:06.080 align:start position:0%
then we come whoops we can't do that
 
04:39:07.510 --> 04:39:07.520 align:start position:0%
there's no way of getting this
 
04:39:09.510 --> 04:39:09.520 align:start position:0%
accountability back in
 
04:39:11.670 --> 04:39:11.680 align:start position:0%
and certainly the legislature when we're
 
04:39:13.910 --> 04:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
talking about the statewide assessment
 
04:39:15.990 --> 04:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
should be involved
 
04:39:17.670 --> 04:39:17.680 align:start position:0%
in what we're going to use whether it's
 
04:39:19.429 --> 04:39:19.439 align:start position:0%
going to be smarter balanced
 
04:39:21.349 --> 04:39:21.359 align:start position:0%
or some other instrument that we use
 
04:39:24.390 --> 04:39:24.400 align:start position:0%
that's what we have that oversight over
 
04:39:26.629 --> 04:39:26.639 align:start position:0%
without that committee we don't have it
 
04:39:28.230 --> 04:39:28.240 align:start position:0%
we don't have it
 
04:39:31.590 --> 04:39:31.600 align:start position:0%
it was a mistake i'm sure if when it was
 
04:39:34.150 --> 04:39:34.160 align:start position:0%
put forward in 2020
 
04:39:34.160 --> 04:39:35.590 align:start position:0%
put forward in 2020
if

04:39:35.590 --> 04:39:35.600 align:start position:0%
if
 
04:39:38.230 --> 04:39:38.240 align:start position:0%
everybody was aware what was going on
 
04:39:40.150 --> 04:39:40.160 align:start position:0%
we would probably say put the brakes on
 
04:39:40.160 --> 04:39:41.110 align:start position:0%
we would probably say put the brakes on
it

04:39:41.110 --> 04:39:41.120 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:39:44.230 --> 04:39:44.240 align:start position:0%
we need to have that available as a tool
 
04:39:46.150 --> 04:39:46.160 align:start position:0%
for this particular committee here and
 
04:39:50.230 --> 04:39:50.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:50.240 --> 04:39:52.470 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:39:52.470 --> 04:39:52.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:39:55.110 --> 04:39:55.120 align:start position:0%
i think that you you can see the what
 
04:39:55.120 --> 04:39:55.830 align:start position:0%
i think that you you can see the what
i've

04:39:55.830 --> 04:39:55.840 align:start position:0%
i've
 
04:39:58.390 --> 04:39:58.400 align:start position:0%
rest of it which i put in there
 
04:40:01.750 --> 04:40:01.760 align:start position:0%
i i put a copy of 242 in there just so
 
04:40:04.788 --> 04:40:04.798 align:start position:0%
you would see on the last page on hb 242
 
04:40:06.868 --> 04:40:06.878 align:start position:0%
that's room that's the four the
 
04:40:08.948 --> 04:40:08.958 align:start position:0%
attachment with a four on it
 
04:40:11.430 --> 04:40:11.440 align:start position:0%
if you went to the fourth page
 
04:40:13.430 --> 04:40:13.440 align:start position:0%
and this is what we acted on when on the
 
04:40:15.910 --> 04:40:15.920 align:start position:0%
veto day it said right within that bill
 
04:40:17.270 --> 04:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
the commissioner shall provide the
 
04:40:18.628 --> 04:40:18.638 align:start position:0%
legislative oversight committee
 
04:40:22.628 --> 04:40:22.638 align:start position:0%
identified in rsa 193 c clone 2 with an
 
04:40:25.350 --> 04:40:25.360 align:start position:0%
annual status report by november 1.
 
04:40:27.350 --> 04:40:27.360 align:start position:0%
if there's no committee anymore there
 
04:40:30.708 --> 04:40:30.718 align:start position:0%
won't be that report that we receive
 
04:40:30.718 --> 04:40:31.830 align:start position:0%
won't be that report that we receive
so

04:40:31.830 --> 04:40:31.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:40:33.430 --> 04:40:33.440 align:start position:0%
it's my
 
04:40:33.440 --> 04:40:35.350 align:start position:0%
it's my
opinion

04:40:35.350 --> 04:40:35.360 align:start position:0%
opinion
 
04:40:38.230 --> 04:40:38.240 align:start position:0%
that we really need to have this put
 
04:40:39.830 --> 04:40:39.840 align:start position:0%
back in the law i've talked with the
 
04:40:41.990 --> 04:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
folks across at lsr and they they see it
 
04:40:42.000 --> 04:40:43.190 align:start position:0%
folks across at lsr and they they see it
too

04:40:43.190 --> 04:40:43.200 align:start position:0%
too
 
04:40:45.350 --> 04:40:45.360 align:start position:0%
i would suggest that
 
04:40:48.310 --> 04:40:48.320 align:start position:0%
that's the primary intent for doing this
 
04:40:50.310 --> 04:40:50.320 align:start position:0%
it's nothing was done
 
04:40:53.910 --> 04:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
to get rid of something uh and do it and
 
04:40:55.990 --> 04:40:56.000 align:start position:0%
do any harm to our legislative process
 
04:40:57.430 --> 04:40:57.440 align:start position:0%
one of those things when we have these
 
04:40:59.910 --> 04:40:59.920 align:start position:0%
large omnibus bills
 
04:41:01.750 --> 04:41:01.760 align:start position:0%
without the time to really do our
 
04:41:03.910 --> 04:41:03.920 align:start position:0%
homework and our work
 
04:41:05.110 --> 04:41:05.120 align:start position:0%
things happen
 
04:41:07.030 --> 04:41:07.040 align:start position:0%
and that's what happened i'm sure it's
 
04:41:09.270 --> 04:41:09.280 align:start position:0%
happened from both parties in the past i
 
04:41:10.628 --> 04:41:10.638 align:start position:0%
know it has
 
04:41:13.830 --> 04:41:13.840 align:start position:0%
and so i'm i'm requesting through this
 
04:41:15.910 --> 04:41:15.920 align:start position:0%
legislation that we repeal that repeal
 
04:41:17.670 --> 04:41:17.680 align:start position:0%
get it back in the book so we can have
 
04:41:20.948 --> 04:41:20.958 align:start position:0%
this oversight that we so dearly cherish
 
04:41:22.550 --> 04:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
here in the legislature thank you very
 
04:41:22.560 --> 04:41:24.150 align:start position:0%
here in the legislature thank you very
much

04:41:24.150 --> 04:41:24.160 align:start position:0%
much
 
04:41:25.590 --> 04:41:25.600 align:start position:0%
thank you i'll be glad to ask any
 
04:41:27.430 --> 04:41:27.440 align:start position:0%
questions if there are any yes
 
04:41:29.350 --> 04:41:29.360 align:start position:0%
representative porter
 
04:41:30.788 --> 04:41:30.798 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
04:41:32.470 --> 04:41:32.480 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh representative
 
04:41:34.390 --> 04:41:34.400 align:start position:0%
vlad do you know how often
 
04:41:34.400 --> 04:41:35.510 align:start position:0%
vlad do you know how often
this

04:41:35.510 --> 04:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:41:37.750 --> 04:41:37.760 align:start position:0%
uh commission legislative oversight
 
04:41:40.390 --> 04:41:40.400 align:start position:0%
committee was meeting were they meeting
 
04:41:42.470 --> 04:41:42.480 align:start position:0%
on a regular basis or was it is that one
 
04:41:43.670 --> 04:41:43.680 align:start position:0%
of the reasons why they hadn't been
 
04:41:45.750 --> 04:41:45.760 align:start position:0%
meeting and that's why it was felt that
 
04:41:46.868 --> 04:41:46.878 align:start position:0%
it maybe
 
04:41:46.878 --> 04:41:47.910 align:start position:0%
it maybe
had

04:41:47.910 --> 04:41:47.920 align:start position:0%
had
 
04:41:50.868 --> 04:41:50.878 align:start position:0%
outlived its usage
 
04:41:53.670 --> 04:41:53.680 align:start position:0%
i think that if if we go back
 
04:41:55.910 --> 04:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
i know the the one of the last times we
 
04:41:58.550 --> 04:41:58.560 align:start position:0%
had a lot of discussion on it is when we
 
04:42:01.430 --> 04:42:01.440 align:start position:0%
we left uh when we
 
04:42:02.550 --> 04:42:02.560 align:start position:0%
looked at
 
04:42:02.560 --> 04:42:03.590 align:start position:0%
looked at
esser

04:42:03.590 --> 04:42:03.600 align:start position:0%
esser
 
04:42:06.070 --> 04:42:06.080 align:start position:0%
the uh and that was about what two or
 
04:42:07.670 --> 04:42:07.680 align:start position:0%
three years ago
 
04:42:09.510 --> 04:42:09.520 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of discussion regarding
 
04:42:11.750 --> 04:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
the oversight and how we and we utilized
 
04:42:13.830 --> 04:42:13.840 align:start position:0%
at that time a great deal
 
04:42:16.390 --> 04:42:16.400 align:start position:0%
but since then when we have not gone
 
04:42:18.708 --> 04:42:18.718 align:start position:0%
forward with changing any kind of
 
04:42:22.550 --> 04:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
federal legislation regard to
 
04:42:24.948 --> 04:42:24.958 align:start position:0%
the the law esser
 
04:42:28.550 --> 04:42:28.560 align:start position:0%
we we haven't addressed that
 
04:42:31.830 --> 04:42:31.840 align:start position:0%
you can see that i had a need to use it
 
04:42:34.150 --> 04:42:34.160 align:start position:0%
when we did 242
 
04:42:37.270 --> 04:42:37.280 align:start position:0%
and uh and i think that we will all have
 
04:42:38.948 --> 04:42:38.958 align:start position:0%
a need when we start talking about the
 
04:42:41.190 --> 04:42:41.200 align:start position:0%
content of an adequate education and
 
04:42:42.788 --> 04:42:42.798 align:start position:0%
secondly when we get into the
 
04:42:45.590 --> 04:42:45.600 align:start position:0%
accountability and the oversight of how
 
04:42:47.590 --> 04:42:47.600 align:start position:0%
we account how we measure growth and all
 
04:42:50.070 --> 04:42:50.080 align:start position:0%
that that will come right back here and
 
04:42:52.948 --> 04:42:52.958 align:start position:0%
it's good to have a group such as this
 
04:42:54.390 --> 04:42:54.400 align:start position:0%
that can
 
04:42:56.708 --> 04:42:56.718 align:start position:0%
get into the let's say the weeds on on
 
04:42:58.470 --> 04:42:58.480 align:start position:0%
some of these assessments
 
04:43:01.190 --> 04:43:01.200 align:start position:0%
and and and try to bring forward i know
 
04:43:02.708 --> 04:43:02.718 align:start position:0%
that's when we came out with the
 
04:43:05.430 --> 04:43:05.440 align:start position:0%
recommendation that statewide
 
04:43:06.868 --> 04:43:06.878 align:start position:0%
achievement shouldn't be just
 
04:43:08.708 --> 04:43:08.718 align:start position:0%
achievement it should be also looking at
 
04:43:08.718 --> 04:43:09.830 align:start position:0%
achievement it should be also looking at
growth

04:43:09.830 --> 04:43:09.840 align:start position:0%
growth
 
04:43:11.110 --> 04:43:11.120 align:start position:0%
so that's one of the positive things
 
04:43:12.708 --> 04:43:12.718 align:start position:0%
that came out of it represented
 
04:43:12.718 --> 04:43:14.150 align:start position:0%
that came out of it represented
follow-up

04:43:14.150 --> 04:43:14.160 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
04:43:17.430 --> 04:43:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:19.750 --> 04:43:19.760 align:start position:0%
until i'm tired i just lost my question
 
04:43:19.760 --> 04:43:21.430 align:start position:0%
until i'm tired i just lost my question
so

04:43:21.430 --> 04:43:21.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:43:23.830 --> 04:43:23.840 align:start position:0%
if how often would this
 
04:43:25.430 --> 04:43:25.440 align:start position:0%
be meeting
 
04:43:27.270 --> 04:43:27.280 align:start position:0%
i mean how long are the terms of the
 
04:43:29.350 --> 04:43:29.360 align:start position:0%
people who are on this i guess i'm
 
04:43:31.350 --> 04:43:31.360 align:start position:0%
looking at who's on the committee
 
04:43:31.360 --> 04:43:32.470 align:start position:0%
looking at who's on the committee
and

04:43:32.470 --> 04:43:32.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:43:33.510 --> 04:43:33.520 align:start position:0%
we've got
 
04:43:34.948 --> 04:43:34.958 align:start position:0%
members of the house and members of the
 
04:43:37.350 --> 04:43:37.360 align:start position:0%
senate is it a two-year term
 
04:43:39.830 --> 04:43:39.840 align:start position:0%
is it a is it a ongoing
 
04:43:42.310 --> 04:43:42.320 align:start position:0%
with no ends in sight or
 
04:43:43.590 --> 04:43:43.600 align:start position:0%
how does it's just
 
04:43:47.110 --> 04:43:47.120 align:start position:0%
how long are the terms
 
04:43:49.110 --> 04:43:49.120 align:start position:0%
it's the chairman of the house education
 
04:43:49.120 --> 04:43:50.230 align:start position:0%
it's the chairman of the house education
committee

04:43:50.230 --> 04:43:50.240 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:43:51.430 --> 04:43:51.440 align:start position:0%
for example
 
04:43:53.910 --> 04:43:53.920 align:start position:0%
uh i would be the chair of it this year
 
04:43:55.270 --> 04:43:55.280 align:start position:0%
it does switch like many of the
 
04:43:56.868 --> 04:43:56.878 align:start position:0%
committee stuff between the senate and
 
04:43:57.830 --> 04:43:57.840 align:start position:0%
the house
 
04:43:59.750 --> 04:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
for the bienniums
 
04:43:59.760 --> 04:44:00.708 align:start position:0%
for the bienniums
um

04:44:00.708 --> 04:44:00.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:44:01.750 --> 04:44:01.760 align:start position:0%
prior to that would have been
 
04:44:03.270 --> 04:44:03.280 align:start position:0%
represented milor prior to that would
 
04:44:05.590 --> 04:44:05.600 align:start position:0%
have been myself for several bienniums
 
04:44:07.910 --> 04:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
and then represent guile they've all
 
04:44:10.150 --> 04:44:10.160 align:start position:0%
conducted these meetings
 
04:44:12.948 --> 04:44:12.958 align:start position:0%
it's based on need and and there's no
 
04:44:14.470 --> 04:44:14.480 align:start position:0%
sense in having a commission meeting
 
04:44:15.590 --> 04:44:15.600 align:start position:0%
just for the sense of having a
 
04:44:17.110 --> 04:44:17.120 align:start position:0%
commission meeting
 
04:44:18.550 --> 04:44:18.560 align:start position:0%
but if you're going to change where
 
04:44:19.910 --> 04:44:19.920 align:start position:0%
you're going with improvement and
 
04:44:21.670 --> 04:44:21.680 align:start position:0%
assessment this is where this really
 
04:44:23.190 --> 04:44:23.200 align:start position:0%
engages it's just like our higher
 
04:44:25.910 --> 04:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
education committee which we have
 
04:44:27.750 --> 04:44:27.760 align:start position:0%
that's going to be a very active
 
04:44:29.990 --> 04:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
committee now when we're talking merger
 
04:44:31.750 --> 04:44:31.760 align:start position:0%
we're talking four-year degrees and all
 
04:44:33.190 --> 04:44:33.200 align:start position:0%
this other stuff at the community
 
04:44:35.030 --> 04:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
college level that's going to kick in
 
04:44:37.350 --> 04:44:37.360 align:start position:0%
and have to work with us
 
04:44:40.310 --> 04:44:40.320 align:start position:0%
so uh i i feel that it's
 
04:44:42.310 --> 04:44:42.320 align:start position:0%
when we are looking for it i think
 
04:44:44.150 --> 04:44:44.160 align:start position:0%
represent umber was correct and
 
04:44:46.070 --> 04:44:46.080 align:start position:0%
contacting me before
 
04:44:48.150 --> 04:44:48.160 align:start position:0%
um she made this decision well we'll
 
04:44:50.230 --> 04:44:50.240 align:start position:0%
just slice this slice and dice it she
 
04:44:50.240 --> 04:44:51.270 align:start position:0%
just slice this slice and dice it she
said

04:44:51.270 --> 04:44:51.280 align:start position:0%
said
 
04:44:53.510 --> 04:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
what's the purpose what's the intent
 
04:44:56.628 --> 04:44:56.638 align:start position:0%
etc so one thing one more okay thank you
 
04:44:58.470 --> 04:44:58.480 align:start position:0%
so i'm looking at the membership and and
 
04:45:00.550 --> 04:45:00.560 align:start position:0%
i don't mean to cause any
 
04:45:03.110 --> 04:45:03.120 align:start position:0%
waves or anything but i'm wondering if
 
04:45:05.990 --> 04:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
there's some opportunity for both the
 
04:45:08.948 --> 04:45:08.958 align:start position:0%
majority party and the minority party to
 
04:45:10.470 --> 04:45:10.480 align:start position:0%
appoint people
 
04:45:12.550 --> 04:45:12.560 align:start position:0%
onto this
 
04:45:14.708 --> 04:45:14.718 align:start position:0%
oversight committee because as it stands
 
04:45:16.550 --> 04:45:16.560 align:start position:0%
now it could be all
 
04:45:18.470 --> 04:45:18.480 align:start position:0%
the majority
 
04:45:20.470 --> 04:45:20.480 align:start position:0%
if that's how the majority wanted it i
 
04:45:22.550 --> 04:45:22.560 align:start position:0%
know in the past there were efforts made
 
04:45:25.110 --> 04:45:25.120 align:start position:0%
to make sure that
 
04:45:27.510 --> 04:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
yeah i i have no object i i think the
 
04:45:29.430 --> 04:45:29.440 align:start position:0%
whole purpose of it is i think there's
 
04:45:32.070 --> 04:45:32.080 align:start position:0%
people here all all around this room
 
04:45:34.230 --> 04:45:34.240 align:start position:0%
which if they had the time
 
04:45:35.590 --> 04:45:35.600 align:start position:0%
because we could be in a year where we
 
04:45:37.910 --> 04:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
needed that to really engage in what
 
04:45:41.270 --> 04:45:41.280 align:start position:0%
we're doing but it's um
 
04:45:43.270 --> 04:45:43.280 align:start position:0%
i would look first for
 
04:45:45.750 --> 04:45:45.760 align:start position:0%
the understanding that people have about
 
04:45:48.628 --> 04:45:48.638 align:start position:0%
improvement assessment and i'd take i
 
04:45:50.550 --> 04:45:50.560 align:start position:0%
would i would hope you're correct i have
 
04:45:53.270 --> 04:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
no it's not a party thing this is all
 
04:45:55.270 --> 04:45:55.280 align:start position:0%
the kids in the state this is how we
 
04:45:57.750 --> 04:45:57.760 align:start position:0%
measure our performance as a state in
 
04:45:59.590 --> 04:45:59.600 align:start position:0%
terms of achievement that we talk about
 
04:46:01.670 --> 04:46:01.680 align:start position:0%
all the time here we've talked about it
 
04:46:01.680 --> 04:46:03.030 align:start position:0%
all the time here we've talked about it
today

04:46:03.030 --> 04:46:03.040 align:start position:0%
today
 
04:46:04.708 --> 04:46:04.718 align:start position:0%
but we do have different viewpoints on
 
04:46:06.070 --> 04:46:06.080 align:start position:0%
certain items and it might well that's
 
04:46:06.080 --> 04:46:07.590 align:start position:0%
certain items and it might well that's
fine

04:46:07.590 --> 04:46:07.600 align:start position:0%
fine
 
04:46:09.510 --> 04:46:09.520 align:start position:0%
that's part of a few points that's part
 
04:46:11.590 --> 04:46:11.600 align:start position:0%
of our society now we have life if we
 
04:46:13.670 --> 04:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
all thought the same i think we'd be
 
04:46:16.470 --> 04:46:16.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:19.030 --> 04:46:19.040 align:start position:0%
represent tina
 
04:46:21.590 --> 04:46:21.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair this is uh probably a
 
04:46:23.430 --> 04:46:23.440 align:start position:0%
teachable moment for me
 
04:46:25.990 --> 04:46:26.000 align:start position:0%
for you to give give me this information
 
04:46:26.000 --> 04:46:26.868 align:start position:0%
for you to give give me this information
but

04:46:26.868 --> 04:46:26.878 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:46:29.190 --> 04:46:29.200 align:start position:0%
uh one of the things i've had difficulty
 
04:46:31.670 --> 04:46:31.680 align:start position:0%
finding is the reports that are supposed
 
04:46:33.110 --> 04:46:33.120 align:start position:0%
to be given
 
04:46:35.030 --> 04:46:35.040 align:start position:0%
to the education committee
 
04:46:36.470 --> 04:46:36.480 align:start position:0%
since i've been
 
04:46:37.910 --> 04:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
on the education committee this is my
 
04:46:39.830 --> 04:46:39.840 align:start position:0%
third term
 
04:46:41.590 --> 04:46:41.600 align:start position:0%
i have not
 
04:46:44.150 --> 04:46:44.160 align:start position:0%
officially received a report
 
04:46:47.030 --> 04:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
from any any kind of working
 
04:46:49.190 --> 04:46:49.200 align:start position:0%
group whether it's legislative overs
 
04:46:50.708 --> 04:46:50.718 align:start position:0%
well the legislative oversight
 
04:46:50.718 --> 04:46:52.070 align:start position:0%
well the legislative oversight
committees

04:46:52.070 --> 04:46:52.080 align:start position:0%
committees
 
04:46:54.310 --> 04:46:54.320 align:start position:0%
usually in in the law state that the
 
04:46:57.350 --> 04:46:57.360 align:start position:0%
report is available to the education
 
04:46:58.628 --> 04:46:58.638 align:start position:0%
committee and
 
04:47:01.030 --> 04:47:01.040 align:start position:0%
uh i thought it would be handed out but
 
04:47:02.550 --> 04:47:02.560 align:start position:0%
you know i'm willing to go and search
 
04:47:04.390 --> 04:47:04.400 align:start position:0%
for it too but
 
04:47:05.990 --> 04:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
i'd would like to know where these
 
04:47:06.000 --> 04:47:07.510 align:start position:0%
i'd would like to know where these
reports

04:47:07.510 --> 04:47:07.520 align:start position:0%
reports
 
04:47:09.830 --> 04:47:09.840 align:start position:0%
are have been published in the past and
 
04:47:13.430 --> 04:47:13.440 align:start position:0%
and how they're distributed yeah
 
04:47:15.350 --> 04:47:15.360 align:start position:0%
i think dissemination of materials is
 
04:47:16.948 --> 04:47:16.958 align:start position:0%
very important it's just like i have a
 
04:47:19.510 --> 04:47:19.520 align:start position:0%
couple reports in there on the desk
 
04:47:20.948 --> 04:47:20.958 align:start position:0%
right now and i handed you know i
 
04:47:22.390 --> 04:47:22.400 align:start position:0%
mentioned it the other day the bullying
 
04:47:24.948 --> 04:47:24.958 align:start position:0%
report and the other one
 
04:47:27.350 --> 04:47:27.360 align:start position:0%
that's all information that everybody
 
04:47:30.550 --> 04:47:30.560 align:start position:0%
should have a chance to see and read
 
04:47:33.030 --> 04:47:33.040 align:start position:0%
the higher education committee has been
 
04:47:34.390 --> 04:47:34.400 align:start position:0%
meeting and
 
04:47:37.030 --> 04:47:37.040 align:start position:0%
that's resulted in
 
04:47:38.550 --> 04:47:38.560 align:start position:0%
a bill that we have coming forward
 
04:47:42.310 --> 04:47:42.320 align:start position:0%
before us which is the bill dealing with
 
04:47:42.320 --> 04:47:43.110 align:start position:0%
before us which is the bill dealing with
the

04:47:43.110 --> 04:47:43.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:47:46.230 --> 04:47:46.240 align:start position:0%
uh merger of granite state and and uh
 
04:47:46.240 --> 04:47:47.510 align:start position:0%
uh merger of granite state and and uh
unh

04:47:47.510 --> 04:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
unh
 
04:47:49.270 --> 04:47:49.280 align:start position:0%
we've had other uh groups that have
 
04:47:52.150 --> 04:47:52.160 align:start position:0%
meeting like the council for uh career
 
04:47:54.470 --> 04:47:54.480 align:start position:0%
technical education we have folks here
 
04:47:56.390 --> 04:47:56.400 align:start position:0%
on this committee that are part of that
 
04:47:57.910 --> 04:47:57.920 align:start position:0%
there again the recommendations are
 
04:48:00.310 --> 04:48:00.320 align:start position:0%
coming forward in legislation
 
04:48:02.470 --> 04:48:02.480 align:start position:0%
the minutes of the meetings
 
04:48:05.190 --> 04:48:05.200 align:start position:0%
are provided and put into that folder
 
04:48:07.510 --> 04:48:07.520 align:start position:0%
but they're not disseminated
 
04:48:09.110 --> 04:48:09.120 align:start position:0%
outwards uh
 
04:48:11.190 --> 04:48:11.200 align:start position:0%
for for one thing we have so many
 
04:48:14.310 --> 04:48:14.320 align:start position:0%
commissions and committees um
 
04:48:17.670 --> 04:48:17.680 align:start position:0%
i i believe that uh it would be wise for
 
04:48:19.830 --> 04:48:19.840 align:start position:0%
us to try and get that information out
 
04:48:22.470 --> 04:48:22.480 align:start position:0%
somehow to those that are interested in
 
04:48:24.470 --> 04:48:24.480 align:start position:0%
receiving this material
 
04:48:26.470 --> 04:48:26.480 align:start position:0%
definitely to the
 
04:48:28.708 --> 04:48:28.718 align:start position:0%
folks which are in leadership on the
 
04:48:30.390 --> 04:48:30.400 align:start position:0%
committee be at the
 
04:48:33.430 --> 04:48:33.440 align:start position:0%
myself or be at the ranking uh person in
 
04:48:36.150 --> 04:48:36.160 align:start position:0%
the minority whatever given year that is
 
04:48:39.110 --> 04:48:39.120 align:start position:0%
we have had this issue for uh for a long
 
04:48:42.470 --> 04:48:42.480 align:start position:0%
time i can remember when uh i first came
 
04:48:45.110 --> 04:48:45.120 align:start position:0%
on here we i didn't know these things
 
04:48:45.120 --> 04:48:46.550 align:start position:0%
on here we i didn't know these things
existed

04:48:46.550 --> 04:48:46.560 align:start position:0%
existed
 
04:48:46.560 --> 04:48:47.350 align:start position:0%
existed
um

04:48:47.350 --> 04:48:47.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:48:49.030 --> 04:48:49.040 align:start position:0%
and i didn't know
 
04:48:50.788 --> 04:48:50.798 align:start position:0%
i hadn't read all the statutes i guess
 
04:48:54.628 --> 04:48:54.638 align:start position:0%
or the rules but uh i i i would support
 
04:48:56.150 --> 04:48:56.160 align:start position:0%
what you're saying represent tanner
 
04:48:57.270 --> 04:48:57.280 align:start position:0%
there's got to be a better way of
 
04:48:59.270 --> 04:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
getting this information out
 
04:49:02.390 --> 04:49:02.400 align:start position:0%
some of it's extremely important um
 
04:49:02.400 --> 04:49:03.430 align:start position:0%
some of it's extremely important um
and

04:49:03.430 --> 04:49:03.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:49:04.628 --> 04:49:04.638 align:start position:0%
there has been question where for
 
04:49:06.390 --> 04:49:06.400 align:start position:0%
example we even need a higher education
 
04:49:06.400 --> 04:49:08.868 align:start position:0%
example we even need a higher education
committee

04:49:08.868 --> 04:49:08.878 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:49:11.190 --> 04:49:11.200 align:start position:0%
i think it's that rotates between the
 
04:49:13.190 --> 04:49:13.200 align:start position:0%
senate and the house i think if you look
 
04:49:15.350 --> 04:49:15.360 align:start position:0%
back the years
 
04:49:18.390 --> 04:49:18.400 align:start position:0%
that we have been most effective
 
04:49:19.750 --> 04:49:19.760 align:start position:0%
are the years
 
04:49:21.910 --> 04:49:21.920 align:start position:0%
we have house leadership
 
04:49:24.550 --> 04:49:24.560 align:start position:0%
in those committees and commissions
 
04:49:26.948 --> 04:49:26.958 align:start position:0%
nothing against the senate but if we put
 
04:49:28.708 --> 04:49:28.718 align:start position:0%
down any committee or commission that
 
04:49:31.030 --> 04:49:31.040 align:start position:0%
was developing and we put down three
 
04:49:33.990 --> 04:49:34.000 align:start position:0%
senators it'll come back one
 
04:49:37.270 --> 04:49:37.280 align:start position:0%
and would be lucky to get one uh
 
04:49:39.990 --> 04:49:40.000 align:start position:0%
we'll get all our representatives and
 
04:49:41.670 --> 04:49:41.680 align:start position:0%
they will be working on it that's
 
04:49:43.270 --> 04:49:43.280 align:start position:0%
happened on the
 
04:49:45.350 --> 04:49:45.360 align:start position:0%
group we had for tuition transportation
 
04:49:47.190 --> 04:49:47.200 align:start position:0%
cte for the first several sessions it
 
04:49:49.190 --> 04:49:49.200 align:start position:0%
was just reps there at the table
 
04:49:51.430 --> 04:49:51.440 align:start position:0%
until the others were appointed
 
04:49:51.440 --> 04:49:52.708 align:start position:0%
until the others were appointed
so

04:49:52.708 --> 04:49:52.718 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:49:54.550 --> 04:49:54.560 align:start position:0%
i think there's a genuine reason why we
 
04:49:57.910 --> 04:49:57.920 align:start position:0%
need these i i if we don't have them
 
04:50:00.310 --> 04:50:00.320 align:start position:0%
we're losing our oversight of where
 
04:50:02.230 --> 04:50:02.240 align:start position:0%
we're going with legislation now and
 
04:50:04.628 --> 04:50:04.638 align:start position:0%
into the future and i i just
 
04:50:06.708 --> 04:50:06.718 align:start position:0%
put the red flag up as a caution be
 
04:50:06.718 --> 04:50:09.030 align:start position:0%
put the red flag up as a caution be
careful

04:50:09.030 --> 04:50:09.040 align:start position:0%
careful
 
04:50:11.270 --> 04:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
any further questions from the committee
 
04:50:12.948 --> 04:50:12.958 align:start position:0%
representative mullen
 
04:50:14.550 --> 04:50:14.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
04:50:17.510 --> 04:50:17.520 align:start position:0%
taking my question representative ladd i
 
04:50:17.520 --> 04:50:18.470 align:start position:0%
taking my question representative ladd i
um

04:50:18.470 --> 04:50:18.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:50:20.628 --> 04:50:20.638 align:start position:0%
when i read this bill i
 
04:50:23.590 --> 04:50:23.600 align:start position:0%
obviously looked at all of the duties of
 
04:50:25.110 --> 04:50:25.120 align:start position:0%
this committee
 
04:50:28.948 --> 04:50:28.958 align:start position:0%
and my question to you is um
 
04:50:32.070 --> 04:50:32.080 align:start position:0%
who is doing all of the work that this
 
04:50:32.080 --> 04:50:33.350 align:start position:0%
who is doing all of the work that this
committee

04:50:33.350 --> 04:50:33.360 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:50:35.670 --> 04:50:35.680 align:start position:0%
had been doing prior to this being
 
04:50:35.680 --> 04:50:37.430 align:start position:0%
had been doing prior to this being
repealed

04:50:37.430 --> 04:50:37.440 align:start position:0%
repealed
 
04:50:38.788 --> 04:50:38.798 align:start position:0%
or is
 
04:50:40.868 --> 04:50:40.878 align:start position:0%
is it not being done
 
04:50:43.750 --> 04:50:43.760 align:start position:0%
there has not been any oversight since
 
04:50:44.948 --> 04:50:44.958 align:start position:0%
this was
 
04:50:48.470 --> 04:50:48.480 align:start position:0%
done away with back what 2020.
 
04:50:50.628 --> 04:50:50.638 align:start position:0%
prior to that so you'll see some of the
 
04:50:52.708 --> 04:50:52.718 align:start position:0%
changes which are occurring in statute
 
04:50:55.270 --> 04:50:55.280 align:start position:0%
happening in 2017. that's right about
 
04:50:57.270 --> 04:50:57.280 align:start position:0%
the time that the assert came out and we
 
04:50:59.750 --> 04:50:59.760 align:start position:0%
we dug in and did some work and that
 
04:51:02.868 --> 04:51:02.878 align:start position:0%
committee was very involved with it
 
04:51:02.878 --> 04:51:03.670 align:start position:0%
committee was very involved with it
um

04:51:03.670 --> 04:51:03.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:51:06.230 --> 04:51:06.240 align:start position:0%
we've also been involved in years with
 
04:51:09.750 --> 04:51:09.760 align:start position:0%
this oversight when we went into common
 
04:51:12.230 --> 04:51:12.240 align:start position:0%
core if you recall way back
 
04:51:15.190 --> 04:51:15.200 align:start position:0%
to send our waiver our application in
 
04:51:17.510 --> 04:51:17.520 align:start position:0%
they had to get approval from that
 
04:51:17.520 --> 04:51:18.708 align:start position:0%
they had to get approval from that
committee

04:51:18.708 --> 04:51:18.718 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:51:20.628 --> 04:51:20.638 align:start position:0%
which i believe it came out like a 4-3
 
04:51:22.788 --> 04:51:22.798 align:start position:0%
vote to go ahead and submit
 
04:51:25.430 --> 04:51:25.440 align:start position:0%
and that was back when we had virginia
 
04:51:27.350 --> 04:51:27.360 align:start position:0%
berry as commissioner
 
04:51:30.230 --> 04:51:30.240 align:start position:0%
and paul leather as the deputy he sat at
 
04:51:31.430 --> 04:51:31.440 align:start position:0%
that meeting
 
04:51:33.270 --> 04:51:33.280 align:start position:0%
that was a good meeting i can remember
 
04:51:33.280 --> 04:51:33.910 align:start position:0%
that was a good meeting i can remember
it

04:51:33.910 --> 04:51:33.920 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:51:37.030 --> 04:51:37.040 align:start position:0%
and we were moving in a good direction
 
04:51:38.788 --> 04:51:38.798 align:start position:0%
it's going to be just as good as what we
 
04:51:41.510 --> 04:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:43.830 --> 04:51:43.840 align:start position:0%
if we sit back and do nothing and we're
 
04:51:47.110 --> 04:51:47.120 align:start position:0%
going to get whatever comes at us
 
04:51:48.788 --> 04:51:48.798 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome
 
04:51:51.270 --> 04:51:51.280 align:start position:0%

04:52:22.708 --> 04:52:22.718 align:start position:0%

greene

04:52:25.830 --> 04:52:25.840 align:start position:0%
greene
 
04:52:27.510 --> 04:52:27.520 align:start position:0%
um i guess i'm going to ask you the
 
04:52:28.708 --> 04:52:28.718 align:start position:0%
question that i just asked
 
04:52:30.628 --> 04:52:30.638 align:start position:0%
representative ladd
 
04:52:33.670 --> 04:52:33.680 align:start position:0%
there is a ton of oversight designated
 
04:52:36.230 --> 04:52:36.240 align:start position:0%
to this committee with regards to
 
04:52:38.550 --> 04:52:38.560 align:start position:0%
academic standards and pupil
 
04:52:41.830 --> 04:52:41.840 align:start position:0%
identification and uh statewide
 
04:52:43.670 --> 04:52:43.680 align:start position:0%
performance targets
 
04:52:46.390 --> 04:52:46.400 align:start position:0%
who's been doing the work um
 
04:52:48.470 --> 04:52:48.480 align:start position:0%
or what is your understanding dr green
 
04:52:50.550 --> 04:52:50.560 align:start position:0%
of who's been doing the work in the
 
04:52:52.628 --> 04:52:52.638 align:start position:0%
absence of the legislative oversight
 
04:52:52.638 --> 04:52:53.830 align:start position:0%
absence of the legislative oversight
committee

04:52:53.830 --> 04:52:53.840 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:52:55.670 --> 04:52:55.680 align:start position:0%
sure so we have a pretty comprehensive
 
04:52:58.150 --> 04:52:58.160 align:start position:0%
system that includes both department and
 
04:53:00.310 --> 04:53:00.320 align:start position:0%
state employees as well as contractors
 
04:53:01.830 --> 04:53:01.840 align:start position:0%
that do a lot of work on our
 
04:53:04.390 --> 04:53:04.400 align:start position:0%
accountability and assessment system
 
04:53:06.788 --> 04:53:06.798 align:start position:0%
but when we talk about oversight you
 
04:53:09.110 --> 04:53:09.120 align:start position:0%
know as something that is oversight of
 
04:53:10.868 --> 04:53:10.878 align:start position:0%
the work itself um we have an
 
04:53:13.350 --> 04:53:13.360 align:start position:0%
accountability state task force uh
 
04:53:15.830 --> 04:53:15.840 align:start position:0%
there's about 30
 
04:53:18.070 --> 04:53:18.080 align:start position:0%
it's mostly made up of superintendents
 
04:53:18.080 --> 04:53:19.270 align:start position:0%
it's mostly made up of superintendents
principals

04:53:19.270 --> 04:53:19.280 align:start position:0%
principals
 
04:53:21.510 --> 04:53:21.520 align:start position:0%
some of the department representatives
 
04:53:23.910 --> 04:53:23.920 align:start position:0%
and some teachers it's a group that was
 
04:53:25.670 --> 04:53:25.680 align:start position:0%
recently reformed
 
04:53:28.230 --> 04:53:28.240 align:start position:0%
they had done some similar work as uh
 
04:53:29.830 --> 04:53:29.840 align:start position:0%
chairman ladd had talked about back in
 
04:53:32.628 --> 04:53:32.638 align:start position:0%
2017 when we were moving from no child
 
04:53:36.470 --> 04:53:36.480 align:start position:0%
left behind to essa and so they had i
 
04:53:37.910 --> 04:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
think they hadn't met for about two
 
04:53:40.070 --> 04:53:40.080 align:start position:0%
years and then about eight months ago we
 
04:53:42.070 --> 04:53:42.080 align:start position:0%
started meeting with that group as again
 
04:53:43.590 --> 04:53:43.600 align:start position:0%
and they reformed because as you said
 
04:53:44.948 --> 04:53:44.958 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of work that does need to
 
04:53:46.788 --> 04:53:46.798 align:start position:0%
go on and we felt like we wanted some of
 
04:53:48.230 --> 04:53:48.240 align:start position:0%
that oversight to come from the field as
 
04:53:48.240 --> 04:53:51.910 align:start position:0%
that oversight to come from the field as
well

04:53:51.910 --> 04:53:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:53.910 --> 04:53:53.920 align:start position:0%
representative tanner
 
04:53:56.550 --> 04:53:56.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr taran thank you dr green so
 
04:53:58.470 --> 04:53:58.480 align:start position:0%
that group is reformed that you've just
 
04:54:00.070 --> 04:54:00.080 align:start position:0%
been talking about
 
04:54:01.670 --> 04:54:01.680 align:start position:0%
where can we find out the information
 
04:54:01.680 --> 04:54:02.390 align:start position:0%
where can we find out the information
about

04:54:02.390 --> 04:54:02.400 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:54:04.070 --> 04:54:04.080 align:start position:0%
who's on the group
 
04:54:06.070 --> 04:54:06.080 align:start position:0%
if they are issuing reports in minutes
 
04:54:08.150 --> 04:54:08.160 align:start position:0%
of the of the meetings
 
04:54:09.830 --> 04:54:09.840 align:start position:0%
i can provide that to the house
 
04:54:11.670 --> 04:54:11.680 align:start position:0%
education committee um it's something
 
04:54:13.990 --> 04:54:14.000 align:start position:0%
that we can uh probably post on our
 
04:54:15.830 --> 04:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
website as well
 
04:54:17.670 --> 04:54:17.680 align:start position:0%
we've had one official meeting of the
 
04:54:19.110 --> 04:54:19.120 align:start position:0%
group the next meeting of the group is
 
04:54:22.390 --> 04:54:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:23.910 --> 04:54:23.920 align:start position:0%
yes so
 
04:54:25.110 --> 04:54:25.120 align:start position:0%
so um
 
04:54:27.830 --> 04:54:27.840 align:start position:0%
can can other reports be be on that
 
04:54:31.430 --> 04:54:31.440 align:start position:0%
website as well from different uh
 
04:54:33.670 --> 04:54:33.680 align:start position:0%
oversight groups or
 
04:54:36.070 --> 04:54:36.080 align:start position:0%
focus groups that that that you have i
 
04:54:37.430 --> 04:54:37.440 align:start position:0%
mean i just
 
04:54:40.788 --> 04:54:40.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:41.990 --> 04:54:42.000 align:start position:0%
the rules
 
04:54:44.788 --> 04:54:44.798 align:start position:0%
wanting to to have access to that and i
 
04:54:46.788 --> 04:54:46.798 align:start position:0%
i just feel like i i need to have more
 
04:54:49.190 --> 04:54:49.200 align:start position:0%
access to some of this this information
 
04:54:51.110 --> 04:54:51.120 align:start position:0%
absolutely i don't see why not okay
 
04:54:53.590 --> 04:54:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:56.310 --> 04:54:56.320 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
04:55:00.788 --> 04:55:00.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:02.868 --> 04:55:02.878 align:start position:0%
i think uh
 
04:55:04.310 --> 04:55:04.320 align:start position:0%
that's the
 
04:55:07.030 --> 04:55:07.040 align:start position:0%
end of the people who want to testify
 
04:55:09.430 --> 04:55:09.440 align:start position:0%
so i will close the hearing on house
 
04:55:12.708 --> 04:55:12.718 align:start position:0%
bill 1236 in a few minutes we'll start
 
04:55:15.670 --> 04:55:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:17.350 --> 04:55:17.360 align:start position:0%
and now that we're out of hearing i just
 
04:55:19.350 --> 04:55:19.360 align:start position:0%
want to add something as
 
04:55:20.628 --> 04:55:20.638 align:start position:0%
luck would have it i happen to have
 
04:55:23.270 --> 04:55:23.280 align:start position:0%
lunch today with
 
04:55:25.270 --> 04:55:25.280 align:start position:0%
karen evil who had just come from
 
04:55:27.270 --> 04:55:27.280 align:start position:0%
legislative administration where they're
 
04:55:28.788 --> 04:55:28.798 align:start position:0%
trying to revive the committee on
 
04:55:30.628 --> 04:55:30.638 align:start position:0%
committees to look at abolishing on
 
04:55:33.830 --> 04:55:33.840 align:start position:0%
these committees and she said that it
 
04:55:35.430 --> 04:55:35.440 align:start position:0%
passed last session and it died in
 
04:55:37.110 --> 04:55:37.120 align:start position:0%
committee of conference coming from the
 
04:55:38.830 --> 04:55:38.840 align:start position:0%
senate the chair and current house
 
04:55:41.910 --> 04:55:41.920 align:start position:0%
wouldn't agree to so they're trying all
 
04:55:44.948 --> 04:55:44.958 align:start position:0%
over again so just this morning at 11 45
 
04:55:46.628 --> 04:55:46.638 align:start position:0%
legislative administration heard the
 
04:55:48.310 --> 04:55:48.320 align:start position:0%
bill on re-establishing the committee on
 
04:55:50.628 --> 04:55:50.638 align:start position:0%
committees to start abolishing things
 
04:55:52.390 --> 04:55:52.400 align:start position:0%
all over again i just thought you guys
 
04:55:53.910 --> 04:55:53.920 align:start position:0%
might find that interesting that this is
 
04:55:56.230 --> 04:55:56.240 align:start position:0%
all going on at the same time today
 
04:55:58.310 --> 04:55:58.320 align:start position:0%
it's just amazing that you know here we
 
04:56:00.788 --> 04:56:00.798 align:start position:0%
have oversight even on the state board
 
04:56:02.868 --> 04:56:02.878 align:start position:0%
and delivering their new rules to us
 
04:56:05.110 --> 04:56:05.120 align:start position:0%
we've given that up by eliminating this
 
04:56:07.350 --> 04:56:07.360 align:start position:0%
particular group
 
04:56:09.990 --> 04:56:10.000 align:start position:0%
it's information that we need
 
04:56:11.990 --> 04:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
and we should really pursue it
 
04:56:14.070 --> 04:56:14.080 align:start position:0%
uh but i i agree with you
 
04:56:15.270 --> 04:56:15.280 align:start position:0%
they're they're all looking at it
 
04:56:17.030 --> 04:56:17.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter which party they always
 
04:56:19.670 --> 04:56:19.680 align:start position:0%
do this and that's their job
 
04:56:45.830 --> 04:56:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:48.230 --> 04:56:48.240 align:start position:0%
you can't talk with these things
 
04:56:50.788 --> 04:56:50.798 align:start position:0%
all wet
 
04:57:10.868 --> 04:57:10.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:10.878 --> 04:57:58.390 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:57:58.390 --> 04:57:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:00.150 --> 04:58:00.160 align:start position:0%
see that's not not if you've got that
 
04:58:01.590 --> 04:58:01.600 align:start position:0%
type of leadership see
 
04:58:03.670 --> 04:58:03.680 align:start position:0%
that's the problem
 
04:58:05.750 --> 04:58:05.760 align:start position:0%
you would think that what's going on in
 
04:58:07.190 --> 04:58:07.200 align:start position:0%
higher ed right now
 
04:58:08.948 --> 04:58:08.958 align:start position:0%
that the higher education committee
 
04:58:11.270 --> 04:58:11.280 align:start position:0%
would be meeting right they only met
 
04:58:13.190 --> 04:58:13.200 align:start position:0%
because i went to ruth and said you know
 
04:58:15.830 --> 04:58:15.840 align:start position:0%
you're chair of this thing oh really
 
04:58:18.868 --> 04:58:18.878 align:start position:0%
and and uh what's going on
 
04:58:20.470 --> 04:58:20.480 align:start position:0%
well you know we've been talking merger
 
04:58:22.390 --> 04:58:22.400 align:start position:0%
about both systems now we're trying to
 
04:58:24.310 --> 04:58:24.320 align:start position:0%
merge with that pretty critical time
 
04:58:26.310 --> 04:58:26.320 align:start position:0%
we're doing this and
 
04:58:28.230 --> 04:58:28.240 align:start position:0%
what's happening is we're having to
 
04:58:31.830 --> 04:58:31.840 align:start position:0%
start doing this with subcommittee work
 
04:58:33.990 --> 04:58:34.000 align:start position:0%
and or like we did remember the group we
 
04:58:36.390 --> 04:58:36.400 align:start position:0%
got together and we looked at the 30 or
 
04:58:38.470 --> 04:58:38.480 align:start position:0%
40 type questions regarding the larger
 
04:58:38.480 --> 04:58:39.430 align:start position:0%
40 type questions regarding the larger
merger

04:58:39.430 --> 04:58:39.440 align:start position:0%
merger
 
04:58:42.150 --> 04:58:42.160 align:start position:0%
and we said slow down no that worked out
 
04:58:43.430 --> 04:58:43.440 align:start position:0%
well i thought the public higher
 
04:58:45.350 --> 04:58:45.360 align:start position:0%
education study commission committing
 
04:58:47.830 --> 04:58:47.840 align:start position:0%
work well two years ago
 
04:58:49.430 --> 04:58:49.440 align:start position:0%
and we were very fortunate though
 
04:58:52.070 --> 04:58:52.080 align:start position:0%
because division two had asked for that
 
04:58:52.080 --> 04:58:53.910 align:start position:0%
because division two had asked for that
report

04:58:53.910 --> 04:58:53.920 align:start position:0%
report
 
04:58:53.920 --> 04:58:54.868 align:start position:0%
report
now

04:58:54.868 --> 04:58:54.878 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:58:56.948 --> 04:58:56.958 align:start position:0%
and see there there's
 
04:58:59.190 --> 04:58:59.200 align:start position:0%
one i agree i wouldn't rotate it between
 
04:59:02.070 --> 04:59:02.080 align:start position:0%
the center no no no i can't keep it yeah
 
04:59:03.750 --> 04:59:03.760 align:start position:0%
and you know what you said it's probably
 
04:59:06.628 --> 04:59:06.638 align:start position:0%
going to be just that you know
 
04:59:36.390 --> 04:59:36.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:38.788 --> 04:59:38.798 align:start position:0%
thursday would be like four after we're
 
04:59:38.798 --> 04:59:39.510 align:start position:0%
thursday would be like four after we're
done

04:59:39.510 --> 04:59:39.520 align:start position:0%
done
 
04:59:42.868 --> 04:59:42.878 align:start position:0%
okay yeah yeah and mel can stay flexible
 
04:59:44.868 --> 04:59:44.878 align:start position:0%
but we just wanted to talk about what we
 
04:59:46.550 --> 04:59:46.560 align:start position:0%
talked about okay
 
04:59:48.470 --> 04:59:48.480 align:start position:0%
which is let's see if we can come
 
05:00:19.190 --> 05:00:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:21.750 --> 05:00:21.760 align:start position:0%
here is yeah he can actually go through
 
05:00:21.760 --> 05:00:22.868 align:start position:0%
here is yeah he can actually go through
um

05:00:22.868 --> 05:00:22.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:00:25.350 --> 05:00:25.360 align:start position:0%
bills and put a report together and
 
05:00:26.788 --> 05:00:26.798 align:start position:0%
stuff like that too
 
05:00:28.550 --> 05:00:28.560 align:start position:0%
i was you know
 
05:00:32.708 --> 05:00:32.718 align:start position:0%
you i had you make the motion on the
 
05:00:34.628 --> 05:00:34.638 align:start position:0%
granite state yeah i've got the board oh
 
05:00:36.230 --> 05:00:36.240 align:start position:0%
you got it done because i don't know
 
05:00:37.670 --> 05:00:37.680 align:start position:0%
dave if you haven't i could just give
 
05:00:39.030 --> 05:00:39.040 align:start position:0%
you one and see what you're thinking
 
05:00:39.040 --> 05:00:39.830 align:start position:0%
you one and see what you're thinking
there

05:00:39.830 --> 05:00:39.840 align:start position:0%
there
 
05:00:40.948 --> 05:00:40.958 align:start position:0%
then uh
 
05:00:43.270 --> 05:00:43.280 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm happy
 
05:00:45.590 --> 05:00:45.600 align:start position:0%
okay because i got i got a little cheat
 
05:00:50.390 --> 05:00:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:52.150 --> 05:00:52.160 align:start position:0%
because and we don't have to make that
 
05:00:54.230 --> 05:00:54.240 align:start position:0%
very long yeah no no no three three
 
05:00:56.628 --> 05:00:56.638 align:start position:0%
three sentences three or four cents max
 
05:00:58.230 --> 05:00:58.240 align:start position:0%
great you send me three and i'll add one
 
05:00:58.240 --> 05:01:02.628 align:start position:0%
great you send me three and i'll add one
more

05:01:02.628 --> 05:01:02.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:02.638 --> 05:01:04.948 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

05:01:04.948 --> 05:01:04.958 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:01:04.958 --> 05:01:05.990 align:start position:0%
yeah
see

05:01:05.990 --> 05:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
see
 
05:01:08.230 --> 05:01:08.240 align:start position:0%
i i think these oversight yeah a lot of
 
05:01:10.310 --> 05:01:10.320 align:start position:0%
times they don't meet
 
05:01:10.320 --> 05:01:12.230 align:start position:0%
times they don't meet
and

05:01:12.230 --> 05:01:12.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:01:14.390 --> 05:01:14.400 align:start position:0%
and we're losing something but if we're
 
05:01:17.590 --> 05:01:17.600 align:start position:0%
really serious about doing our work here
 
05:01:19.270 --> 05:01:19.280 align:start position:0%
yeah i hear a lot of good questions in
 
05:01:20.788 --> 05:01:20.798 align:start position:0%
these hearings
 
05:01:20.798 --> 05:01:21.670 align:start position:0%
these hearings
that

05:01:21.670 --> 05:01:21.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:01:23.350 --> 05:01:23.360 align:start position:0%
wow wouldn't it be great if we could
 
05:01:25.110 --> 05:01:25.120 align:start position:0%
have another group that we wouldn't have
 
05:01:28.868 --> 05:01:28.878 align:start position:0%
to always be putting together a subgroup
 
05:01:31.830 --> 05:01:31.840 align:start position:0%
direct them there and
 
05:01:33.590 --> 05:01:33.600 align:start position:0%
and and what's the agenda that's put
 
05:01:35.990 --> 05:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
together on these the on these oversight
 
05:01:38.230 --> 05:01:38.240 align:start position:0%
committees they don't know what's going
 
05:01:38.240 --> 05:01:39.910 align:start position:0%
committees they don't know what's going
on

05:01:39.910 --> 05:01:39.920 align:start position:0%
on
 
05:01:42.390 --> 05:01:42.400 align:start position:0%
so then we have folks
 
05:01:43.750 --> 05:01:43.760 align:start position:0%
that are making decisions we could have
 
05:01:45.030 --> 05:01:45.040 align:start position:0%
superintendents making all these
 
05:01:45.040 --> 05:01:48.390 align:start position:0%
superintendents making all these
decisions

05:01:48.390 --> 05:01:48.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:50.150 --> 05:01:50.160 align:start position:0%
yeah which
 
05:01:52.868 --> 05:01:52.878 align:start position:0%
it's not the way we operate
 
05:01:56.610 --> 05:01:56.620 align:start position:0%
yeah so yeah okay so tomorrow yeah
 
05:01:56.620 --> 05:02:08.070 align:start position:0%
yeah so yeah okay so tomorrow yeah

house bill 1639 relative to the youth
 
05:03:22.470 --> 05:03:22.480 align:start position:0%
risk behavior survey in schools and i

05:03:29.990 --> 05:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and
 
05:03:31.910 --> 05:03:31.920 align:start position:0%

05:03:36.160 --> 05:03:37.190 align:start position:0%
district 20. i have 10 on the thing
because

05:03:37.190 --> 05:03:37.200 align:start position:0%
because
 
05:03:39.190 --> 05:03:39.200 align:start position:0%

listfield
 
05:03:48.070 --> 05:03:48.080 align:start position:0%
youth risk behavior survey
 
05:03:49.510 --> 05:03:49.520 align:start position:0%
some years ago
 
05:03:51.590 --> 05:03:51.600 align:start position:0%
some of you were here i introduced the
 
05:03:54.070 --> 05:03:54.080 align:start position:0%
bill to put a rein in on non-academic
 
05:03:54.080 --> 05:03:55.190 align:start position:0%
bill to put a rein in on non-academic
surveys

05:03:55.190 --> 05:03:55.200 align:start position:0%
surveys
 
05:03:57.510 --> 05:03:57.520 align:start position:0%
parents had to be notified and questions
 
05:03:57.520 --> 05:03:58.788 align:start position:0%
parents had to be notified and questions
provided

05:03:58.788 --> 05:03:58.798 align:start position:0%
provided
 
05:04:00.868 --> 05:04:00.878 align:start position:0%
first bill was for opt-out it was later
 
05:04:02.628 --> 05:04:02.638 align:start position:0%
changed to opt-in
 
05:04:05.590 --> 05:04:05.600 align:start position:0%
bill finally passed and is now law even
 
05:04:07.430 --> 05:04:07.440 align:start position:0%
though have been multiple tries to
 
05:04:09.190 --> 05:04:09.200 align:start position:0%
change it over the years
 
05:04:11.590 --> 05:04:11.600 align:start position:0%
argument is that schools in some cases
 
05:04:14.310 --> 05:04:14.320 align:start position:0%
get money for doing the surveys
 
05:04:16.550 --> 05:04:16.560 align:start position:0%
selling student information for monday
 
05:04:20.390 --> 05:04:20.400 align:start position:0%
for money i guess is okay for some
 
05:04:22.550 --> 05:04:22.560 align:start position:0%
however the youth risk behavior survey
 
05:04:25.510 --> 05:04:25.520 align:start position:0%
was left in this survey is taken by the
 
05:04:27.990 --> 05:04:28.000 align:start position:0%
joke by most high school students
 
05:04:30.070 --> 05:04:30.080 align:start position:0%
when i was on the school board this was
 
05:04:32.550 --> 05:04:32.560 align:start position:0%
given in our high school i heard from my
 
05:04:32.560 --> 05:04:33.750 align:start position:0%
given in our high school i heard from my
spies

05:04:33.750 --> 05:04:33.760 align:start position:0%
spies
 
05:04:36.310 --> 05:04:36.320 align:start position:0%
that the student which was students that
 
05:04:38.628 --> 05:04:38.638 align:start position:0%
the students were taking this as a class
 
05:04:38.638 --> 05:04:40.788 align:start position:0%
the students were taking this as a class

05:04:40.788 --> 05:04:40.798 align:start position:0%
project
 
05:04:42.708 --> 05:04:42.718 align:start position:0%
for example how many times do we get
 
05:04:42.718 --> 05:04:45.270 align:start position:0%
for example how many times do we get
drunk

05:04:45.270 --> 05:04:45.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:48.628 --> 05:04:48.638 align:start position:0%
mary does your boyfriend hit you
 
05:04:51.270 --> 05:04:51.280 align:start position:0%
uh do you take drugs
 
05:04:53.270 --> 05:04:53.280 align:start position:0%
some weeks later our principal came to
 
05:04:54.628 --> 05:04:54.638 align:start position:0%
our school board meeting with the
 
05:04:56.708 --> 05:04:56.718 align:start position:0%
disastrous results
 
05:04:58.948 --> 05:04:58.958 align:start position:0%
i then informed him how the survey was
 
05:05:01.830 --> 05:05:01.840 align:start position:0%
taken the student school board member we
 
05:05:04.230 --> 05:05:04.240 align:start position:0%
have two on our school board student
 
05:05:05.750 --> 05:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
verified this
 
05:05:08.150 --> 05:05:08.160 align:start position:0%
other schools have the same issues when
 
05:05:10.628 --> 05:05:10.638 align:start position:0%
students know the survey is being taken
 
05:05:12.788 --> 05:05:12.798 align:start position:0%
social media goes rampant with entries
 
05:05:15.430 --> 05:05:15.440 align:start position:0%
on how to answer the questions
 
05:05:18.390 --> 05:05:18.400 align:start position:0%
also parents need to know how what their
 
05:05:20.310 --> 05:05:20.320 align:start position:0%
children are being asked
 
05:05:21.990 --> 05:05:22.000 align:start position:0%
parental rights
 
05:05:24.070 --> 05:05:24.080 align:start position:0%
all questions on any survey must be
 
05:05:26.150 --> 05:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
given to parents so they can make the
 
05:05:28.150 --> 05:05:28.160 align:start position:0%
decision to allow their child to take
 
05:05:30.550 --> 05:05:30.560 align:start position:0%
the survey over the years we've heard
 
05:05:32.708 --> 05:05:32.718 align:start position:0%
arguments that parents do not get the
 
05:05:35.030 --> 05:05:35.040 align:start position:0%
permission slip for the survey so they
 
05:05:36.628 --> 05:05:36.638 align:start position:0%
do not opt in
 
05:05:38.230 --> 05:05:38.240 align:start position:0%
interesting parents have to give an
 
05:05:40.628 --> 05:05:40.638 align:start position:0%
opt-in for field trips those seem to be
 
05:05:40.638 --> 05:05:41.670 align:start position:0%
opt-in for field trips those seem to be
returned

05:05:41.670 --> 05:05:41.680 align:start position:0%
returned
 
05:05:43.590 --> 05:05:43.600 align:start position:0%
parents don't opt in because they want
 
05:05:45.350 --> 05:05:45.360 align:start position:0%
the child to take it
 
05:05:47.670 --> 05:05:47.680 align:start position:0%
now also nowadays this can also be done
 
05:05:51.510 --> 05:05:51.520 align:start position:0%
electronically emails etc to the parents
 
05:05:53.510 --> 05:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
also sexual questions how many high
 
05:05:55.350 --> 05:05:55.360 align:start position:0%
school students will answer that they
 
05:05:57.430 --> 05:05:57.440 align:start position:0%
are not sexually active
 
05:05:59.430 --> 05:05:59.440 align:start position:0%
do any remember when you went to high
 
05:05:59.440 --> 05:06:01.190 align:start position:0%
do any remember when you went to high
school

05:06:01.190 --> 05:06:01.200 align:start position:0%
school
 
05:06:03.030 --> 05:06:03.040 align:start position:0%
these surveys are a joke and high school
 
05:06:05.030 --> 05:06:05.040 align:start position:0%
treat high school students treat them as
 
05:06:05.040 --> 05:06:06.070 align:start position:0%
treat high school students treat them as
such

05:06:06.070 --> 05:06:06.080 align:start position:0%
such
 
05:06:07.670 --> 05:06:07.680 align:start position:0%
answers over time have changed for
 
05:06:09.670 --> 05:06:09.680 align:start position:0%
example when i went to high school if
 
05:06:11.350 --> 05:06:11.360 align:start position:0%
you asked students if they were sexually
 
05:06:13.670 --> 05:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
active of course 90 of the boys would
 
05:06:15.510 --> 05:06:15.520 align:start position:0%
say yes and only 10 of the girls were
 
05:06:18.868 --> 05:06:18.878 align:start position:0%
saying yes now probably now 90 percent
 
05:06:22.230 --> 05:06:22.240 align:start position:0%
say yes and which are still all lies
 
05:06:24.868 --> 05:06:24.878 align:start position:0%
now somebody testified to testify that
 
05:06:27.510 --> 05:06:27.520 align:start position:0%
the survey and others are all academic
 
05:06:29.270 --> 05:06:29.280 align:start position:0%
it is the school's responsibility to
 
05:06:31.350 --> 05:06:31.360 align:start position:0%
teach and not be social workers
 
05:06:33.350 --> 05:06:33.360 align:start position:0%
these surveys only interfere with the
 
05:06:35.910 --> 05:06:35.920 align:start position:0%
student learning activities for example
 
05:06:38.070 --> 05:06:38.080 align:start position:0%
in the cte committee that i'm on it came
 
05:06:40.628 --> 05:06:40.638 align:start position:0%
out the sub cte students may miss their
 
05:06:43.750 --> 05:06:43.760 align:start position:0%
cta cte courses because this survey is
 
05:06:46.230 --> 05:06:46.240 align:start position:0%
taken at their sending school
 
05:06:49.430 --> 05:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
it's been proven time after time that no
 
05:06:51.590 --> 05:06:51.600 align:start position:0%
survey is anonymous and at what
 
05:06:53.350 --> 05:06:53.360 align:start position:0%
percentage does it make the server
 
05:06:55.750 --> 05:06:55.760 align:start position:0%
immaterial if only some are answered
 
05:06:55.760 --> 05:06:56.868 align:start position:0%
immaterial if only some are answered
correctly

05:06:56.868 --> 05:06:56.878 align:start position:0%
correctly
 
05:06:59.590 --> 05:06:59.600 align:start position:0%
remember the survey is done by the cdc
 
05:07:01.670 --> 05:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
and depending on what administration is
 
05:07:04.708 --> 05:07:04.718 align:start position:0%
in power questions do become political
 
05:07:06.470 --> 05:07:06.480 align:start position:0%
in the past there were questions on guns
 
05:07:07.750 --> 05:07:07.760 align:start position:0%
at home
 
05:07:09.590 --> 05:07:09.600 align:start position:0%
now i bet there will be questions on
 
05:07:09.600 --> 05:07:11.030 align:start position:0%
now i bet there will be questions on
vaccinations

05:07:11.030 --> 05:07:11.040 align:start position:0%
vaccinations
 
05:07:13.430 --> 05:07:13.440 align:start position:0%
another argument is that need that they
 
05:07:15.030 --> 05:07:15.040 align:start position:0%
need the entire school to take the
 
05:07:17.430 --> 05:07:17.440 align:start position:0%
survey to get the full result what
 
05:07:19.350 --> 05:07:19.360 align:start position:0%
difference students answering as a joke
 
05:07:23.430 --> 05:07:23.440 align:start position:0%
or not answering at all and thank you
 
05:07:25.350 --> 05:07:25.360 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative are there
 
05:07:29.990 --> 05:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:32.788 --> 05:07:32.798 align:start position:0%
uh seeing none just one last point i do
 
05:07:35.430 --> 05:07:35.440 align:start position:0%
did find a an error on line 12 which
 
05:07:37.190 --> 05:07:37.200 align:start position:0%
i'll get fixed thank you
 
05:07:40.390 --> 05:07:40.400 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative
 
05:07:40.400 --> 05:07:41.590 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative
next

05:07:41.590 --> 05:07:41.600 align:start position:0%
next
 
05:07:52.550 --> 05:07:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:54.070 --> 05:07:54.080 align:start position:0%
good afternoon mr chairman members of
 
05:07:56.390 --> 05:07:56.400 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
05:07:57.670 --> 05:07:57.680 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is david
 
05:07:59.190 --> 05:07:59.200 align:start position:0%
goldstein i'm the chief of police in the
 
05:08:00.948 --> 05:08:00.958 align:start position:0%
city of franklin
 
05:08:03.110 --> 05:08:03.120 align:start position:0%
and i'm here on behalf of the new
 
05:08:05.030 --> 05:08:05.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire associations of chiefs of
 
05:08:05.040 --> 05:08:06.150 align:start position:0%
hampshire associations of chiefs of
police

05:08:06.150 --> 05:08:06.160 align:start position:0%
police
 
05:08:07.510 --> 05:08:07.520 align:start position:0%
and we object
 
05:08:10.470 --> 05:08:10.480 align:start position:0%
to the um bill as written
 
05:08:12.070 --> 05:08:12.080 align:start position:0%
and quite simply we object to the
 
05:08:13.830 --> 05:08:13.840 align:start position:0%
portion that's opt in
 
05:08:17.110 --> 05:08:17.120 align:start position:0%
we would prefer to leave it as opt-out
 
05:08:19.190 --> 05:08:19.200 align:start position:0%
and the example that i had relative to
 
05:08:21.670 --> 05:08:21.680 align:start position:0%
that is a student's backpack how many
 
05:08:23.110 --> 05:08:23.120 align:start position:0%
parents actually get to know what kind
 
05:08:25.110 --> 05:08:25.120 align:start position:0%
of paperwork's in there
 
05:08:27.030 --> 05:08:27.040 align:start position:0%
i've been a police officer for over 42
 
05:08:27.040 --> 05:08:28.230 align:start position:0%
i've been a police officer for over 42
years

05:08:28.230 --> 05:08:28.240 align:start position:0%
years
 
05:08:30.150 --> 05:08:30.160 align:start position:0%
and i've been a police chief for over 18
 
05:08:30.160 --> 05:08:31.430 align:start position:0%
and i've been a police chief for over 18
years

05:08:31.430 --> 05:08:31.440 align:start position:0%
years
 
05:08:33.270 --> 05:08:33.280 align:start position:0%
uh and in light of this particular
 
05:08:34.708 --> 05:08:34.718 align:start position:0%
committee i'll share a little bit of my
 
05:08:36.868 --> 05:08:36.878 align:start position:0%
background and as to why
 
05:08:38.628 --> 05:08:38.638 align:start position:0%
we have an interest in this particular
 
05:08:38.638 --> 05:08:39.750 align:start position:0%
we have an interest in this particular
bill

05:08:39.750 --> 05:08:39.760 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:08:41.830 --> 05:08:41.840 align:start position:0%
i have a bachelor's degree in psychology
 
05:08:43.910 --> 05:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
a master's degree in public health and a
 
05:08:43.920 --> 05:08:45.110 align:start position:0%
a master's degree in public health and a
phd

05:08:45.110 --> 05:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
phd
 
05:08:47.110 --> 05:08:47.120 align:start position:0%
in counseling and human services and i
 
05:08:49.750 --> 05:08:49.760 align:start position:0%
am working on a second phd in psychology
 
05:08:51.910 --> 05:08:51.920 align:start position:0%
and sociology at present
 
05:08:53.990 --> 05:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
oh and by the way mr chairman just for
 
05:08:55.910 --> 05:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
future reference the configuration of
 
05:08:58.708 --> 05:08:58.718 align:start position:0%
the flags is incorrect
 
05:09:03.190 --> 05:09:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:05.750 --> 05:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
in franklin we depend on the
 
05:09:08.708 --> 05:09:08.718 align:start position:0%
youth behavior the yrbs
 
05:09:11.670 --> 05:09:11.680 align:start position:0%
approximately 13 years ago we applied
 
05:09:13.990 --> 05:09:14.000 align:start position:0%
for a multi-million dollar grant
 
05:09:16.230 --> 05:09:16.240 align:start position:0%
to study youth behavior relative to drug
 
05:09:16.240 --> 05:09:17.830 align:start position:0%
to study youth behavior relative to drug
abuse

05:09:17.830 --> 05:09:17.840 align:start position:0%
abuse
 
05:09:20.868 --> 05:09:20.878 align:start position:0%
and from a public health point of view
 
05:09:22.470 --> 05:09:22.480 align:start position:0%
we wanted to look at it from a primary
 
05:09:24.470 --> 05:09:24.480 align:start position:0%
prevention point of view as opposed to
 
05:09:26.550 --> 05:09:26.560 align:start position:0%
rehabilitation and treatment we wanted
 
05:09:26.560 --> 05:09:27.910 align:start position:0%
rehabilitation and treatment we wanted
prevention

05:09:27.910 --> 05:09:27.920 align:start position:0%
prevention
 
05:09:29.990 --> 05:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
the yrbs gave us a great deal of
 
05:09:31.430 --> 05:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
information that we were able to use in
 
05:09:32.788 --> 05:09:32.798 align:start position:0%
applying for a multi-million dollar
 
05:09:34.628 --> 05:09:34.638 align:start position:0%
grant that is still in effect today and
 
05:09:40.550 --> 05:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:43.510 --> 05:09:43.520 align:start position:0%
we certainly uh are appreciative of the
 
05:09:46.310 --> 05:09:46.320 align:start position:0%
fact as in any survey research the
 
05:09:48.310 --> 05:09:48.320 align:start position:0%
difficulties that one runs into with
 
05:09:50.230 --> 05:09:50.240 align:start position:0%
questionnaires but there really is no
 
05:09:53.430 --> 05:09:53.440 align:start position:0%
other way to get this information
 
05:09:55.830 --> 05:09:55.840 align:start position:0%
the comments of the previous speaker are
 
05:09:58.310 --> 05:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
taken uh certainly with a grain of salt
 
05:10:01.510 --> 05:10:01.520 align:start position:0%
uh because i'm unaware personally of any
 
05:10:03.430 --> 05:10:03.440 align:start position:0%
of the facts and circumstances that
 
05:10:05.510 --> 05:10:05.520 align:start position:0%
underlie his arguments the uh the
 
05:10:08.310 --> 05:10:08.320 align:start position:0%
resources that he relied on for those
 
05:10:10.070 --> 05:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
certainly children will be children
 
05:10:11.750 --> 05:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
students will be students we understand
 
05:10:13.990 --> 05:10:14.000 align:start position:0%
all of that but again we do get some
 
05:10:15.750 --> 05:10:15.760 align:start position:0%
legitimate uh
 
05:10:18.390 --> 05:10:18.400 align:start position:0%
results from the yrbs
 
05:10:20.868 --> 05:10:20.878 align:start position:0%
so with that
 
05:10:22.708 --> 05:10:22.718 align:start position:0%
again we would only ask that it be an
 
05:10:24.628 --> 05:10:24.638 align:start position:0%
opt-in excuse me opt-out as opposed to
 
05:10:25.990 --> 05:10:26.000 align:start position:0%
an opt-in and i'm happy to answer any
 
05:10:28.150 --> 05:10:28.160 align:start position:0%
questions the committee might have thank
 
05:10:29.990 --> 05:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
you very much chief are there any
 
05:10:31.830 --> 05:10:31.840 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
05:10:33.670 --> 05:10:33.680 align:start position:0%
yes representative mullen
 
05:10:36.070 --> 05:10:36.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
05:10:38.948 --> 05:10:38.958 align:start position:0%
coming to meet with us today
 
05:10:41.830 --> 05:10:41.840 align:start position:0%
would you say that your work with youth
 
05:10:45.190 --> 05:10:45.200 align:start position:0%
in the city of franklin is
 
05:10:47.830 --> 05:10:47.840 align:start position:0%
affected by the information that you get
 
05:10:50.550 --> 05:10:50.560 align:start position:0%
from the youth risk behavior survey
 
05:10:52.788 --> 05:10:52.798 align:start position:0%
absolutely uh what we do
 
05:10:55.270 --> 05:10:55.280 align:start position:0%
uh is we work directly with all of the
 
05:10:57.990 --> 05:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
schools in the city uh while the yrbs is
 
05:10:59.910 --> 05:10:59.920 align:start position:0%
primarily high school as you all know
 
05:11:01.990 --> 05:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
for a while we were able to do middle
 
05:11:03.670 --> 05:11:03.680 align:start position:0%
school as well but it became untenable
 
05:11:05.430 --> 05:11:05.440 align:start position:0%
to be able to do that but yes the short
 
05:11:07.510 --> 05:11:07.520 align:start position:0%
answer to your question is it does help
 
05:11:09.110 --> 05:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
us with the teachers and with the
 
05:11:11.030 --> 05:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
students and trying to develop these
 
05:11:13.830 --> 05:11:13.840 align:start position:0%
programs specifically in our case for
 
05:11:17.190 --> 05:11:17.200 align:start position:0%
primary prevention on drug abuse
 
05:11:19.670 --> 05:11:19.680 align:start position:0%
further questions representative porter
 
05:11:21.110 --> 05:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
05:11:23.270 --> 05:11:23.280 align:start position:0%
taking my question um can you answer for
 
05:11:23.280 --> 05:11:24.070 align:start position:0%
taking my question um can you answer for
me

05:11:24.070 --> 05:11:24.080 align:start position:0%
me
 
05:11:26.550 --> 05:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
are the results of these um surveys
 
05:11:26.560 --> 05:11:27.830 align:start position:0%
are the results of these um surveys
confidential

05:11:27.830 --> 05:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
confidential
 
05:11:29.590 --> 05:11:29.600 align:start position:0%
yes from our point of view they
 
05:11:31.750 --> 05:11:31.760 align:start position:0%
absolutely are and i've seen nothing in
 
05:11:34.550 --> 05:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
my school system and i am very close
 
05:11:36.070 --> 05:11:36.080 align:start position:0%
with our superintendent and the school
 
05:11:37.990 --> 05:11:38.000 align:start position:0%
board i've seen nothing to suggest
 
05:11:38.000 --> 05:11:39.510 align:start position:0%
board i've seen nothing to suggest
otherwise

05:11:39.510 --> 05:11:39.520 align:start position:0%
otherwise
 
05:11:42.310 --> 05:11:42.320 align:start position:0%
follow up so after the survey is taken
 
05:11:44.150 --> 05:11:44.160 align:start position:0%
are they taken on the computer are they
 
05:11:46.470 --> 05:11:46.480 align:start position:0%
taking paper and pencil and when they're
 
05:11:48.788 --> 05:11:48.798 align:start position:0%
done what happens with that material
 
05:11:50.470 --> 05:11:50.480 align:start position:0%
that i don't know because we don't get
 
05:11:51.830 --> 05:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
involved in that part that's strictly
 
05:11:51.840 --> 05:11:52.868 align:start position:0%
involved in that part that's strictly
empty

05:11:52.868 --> 05:11:52.878 align:start position:0%
empty
 
05:11:54.390 --> 05:11:54.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:12:03.430 --> 05:12:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:03.440 --> 05:12:05.270 align:start position:0%
 
uh

05:12:05.270 --> 05:12:05.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:12:06.868 --> 05:12:06.878 align:start position:0%
you've got the various levels of
 
05:12:09.110 --> 05:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
expertise uncommon perhaps in the
 
05:12:11.990 --> 05:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
average person in your position
 
05:12:14.470 --> 05:12:14.480 align:start position:0%
as such i think would you be able to
 
05:12:16.310 --> 05:12:16.320 align:start position:0%
give us
 
05:12:19.510 --> 05:12:19.520 align:start position:0%
suggestions i guess is the right word um
 
05:12:22.070 --> 05:12:22.080 align:start position:0%
for how we might improve the testing so
 
05:12:23.670 --> 05:12:23.680 align:start position:0%
that we don't get
 
05:12:23.680 --> 05:12:25.430 align:start position:0%
that we don't get
capricious

05:12:25.430 --> 05:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
capricious
 
05:12:27.270 --> 05:12:27.280 align:start position:0%
unserious answers
 
05:12:29.430 --> 05:12:29.440 align:start position:0%
and such in other words how do you turn
 
05:12:32.788 --> 05:12:32.798 align:start position:0%
it into a valid survey in your opinion
 
05:12:34.788 --> 05:12:34.798 align:start position:0%
well again i don't think it's invalid at
 
05:12:37.110 --> 05:12:37.120 align:start position:0%
this point so i would suggest that we
 
05:12:39.430 --> 05:12:39.440 align:start position:0%
continue with it make it better make it
 
05:12:42.788 --> 05:12:42.798 align:start position:0%
better certainly uh well again i i'm i
 
05:12:44.868 --> 05:12:44.878 align:start position:0%
guess i'm old-fashioned i i've been
 
05:12:47.830 --> 05:12:47.840 align:start position:0%
around an awful long time uh and i still
 
05:12:49.750 --> 05:12:49.760 align:start position:0%
believe that students and teachers have
 
05:12:50.788 --> 05:12:50.798 align:start position:0%
a very
 
05:12:53.670 --> 05:12:53.680 align:start position:0%
special and strong bond and i believe
 
05:12:55.430 --> 05:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
the teachers become teachers in order to
 
05:12:57.510 --> 05:12:57.520 align:start position:0%
make to do that and to work with their
 
05:12:59.430 --> 05:12:59.440 align:start position:0%
students and to help them and i think
 
05:13:00.788 --> 05:13:00.798 align:start position:0%
that's the most important thing right
 
05:13:03.270 --> 05:13:03.280 align:start position:0%
there is to keep that bond as strong as
 
05:13:05.110 --> 05:13:05.120 align:start position:0%
it can be for as long as it can be and
 
05:13:06.708 --> 05:13:06.718 align:start position:0%
then we'll get the legitimate results
 
05:13:08.470 --> 05:13:08.480 align:start position:0%
from our students because they'll trust
 
05:13:10.470 --> 05:13:10.480 align:start position:0%
their teachers there's no reason not to
 
05:13:12.868 --> 05:13:12.878 align:start position:0%
trust a teacher at least in my opinion
 
05:13:14.788 --> 05:13:14.798 align:start position:0%
uh other than that certainly we can
 
05:13:17.510 --> 05:13:17.520 align:start position:0%
continue to look at the the application
 
05:13:20.070 --> 05:13:20.080 align:start position:0%
of the survey itself how it's done if
 
05:13:22.150 --> 05:13:22.160 align:start position:0%
it's done properly again the question
 
05:13:25.430 --> 05:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
about computer versus paper and pencil
 
05:13:27.510 --> 05:13:27.520 align:start position:0%
any of that stuff certainly we can we
 
05:13:29.910 --> 05:13:29.920 align:start position:0%
can look at that but i think it's a very
 
05:13:32.390 --> 05:13:32.400 align:start position:0%
valid study right now in public health
 
05:13:34.470 --> 05:13:34.480 align:start position:0%
which this essentially is
 
05:13:36.868 --> 05:13:36.878 align:start position:0%
in public health research these are the
 
05:13:38.948 --> 05:13:38.958 align:start position:0%
types of questions we have to ask if we
 
05:13:41.190 --> 05:13:41.200 align:start position:0%
want to know what's going on
 
05:13:43.510 --> 05:13:43.520 align:start position:0%
do we want not do we want to put blood
 
05:13:44.948 --> 05:13:44.958 align:start position:0%
turn a blind eye to some of these
 
05:13:47.110 --> 05:13:47.120 align:start position:0%
questions yes sexual behavior amongst
 
05:13:48.948 --> 05:13:48.958 align:start position:0%
adolescents is kind of embarrassing for
 
05:13:51.510 --> 05:13:51.520 align:start position:0%
everybody but that way we can address
 
05:13:53.510 --> 05:13:53.520 align:start position:0%
issues that children might have drug
 
05:13:54.948 --> 05:13:54.958 align:start position:0%
abuse from our point of view is
 
05:13:57.110 --> 05:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
incredibly important because we've lost
 
05:13:58.550 --> 05:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
a generation
 
05:13:59.990 --> 05:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
to drug abuse
 
05:14:01.510 --> 05:14:01.520 align:start position:0%
and i challenge anybody to tell me we
 
05:14:03.830 --> 05:14:03.840 align:start position:0%
have not because i see it on a daily
 
05:14:03.840 --> 05:14:04.788 align:start position:0%
have not because i see it on a daily
basis

05:14:04.788 --> 05:14:04.798 align:start position:0%
basis
 
05:14:06.628 --> 05:14:06.638 align:start position:0%
and my officers see it and the rest of
 
05:14:08.070 --> 05:14:08.080 align:start position:0%
my colleagues in the states see and
 
05:14:11.110 --> 05:14:11.120 align:start position:0%
we're just a small state so certainly
 
05:14:13.190 --> 05:14:13.200 align:start position:0%
i think that we just maintain and we
 
05:14:14.628 --> 05:14:14.638 align:start position:0%
continue forward
 
05:14:16.948 --> 05:14:16.958 align:start position:0%
there are other studies in history the
 
05:14:19.670 --> 05:14:19.680 align:start position:0%
framingham study on cardiac issues
 
05:14:21.910 --> 05:14:21.920 align:start position:0%
is ongoing it's a it's a longitudinal
 
05:14:23.670 --> 05:14:23.680 align:start position:0%
study it's been going on for decades in
 
05:14:25.590 --> 05:14:25.600 align:start position:0%
order to follow some of these things we
 
05:14:27.830 --> 05:14:27.840 align:start position:0%
need to have this kind of information so
 
05:14:29.590 --> 05:14:29.600 align:start position:0%
certainly i guess to try to answer your
 
05:14:29.600 --> 05:14:30.708 align:start position:0%
certainly i guess to try to answer your
question

05:14:30.708 --> 05:14:30.718 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:14:33.270 --> 05:14:33.280 align:start position:0%
in short form is keep the relationship
 
05:14:34.550 --> 05:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
going and that's the best thing we can
 
05:14:37.830 --> 05:14:37.840 align:start position:0%
do in my humble opinion follow-up yes
 
05:14:40.310 --> 05:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
could i i ask you further then what
 
05:14:43.030 --> 05:14:43.040 align:start position:0%
correlations are made that you can
 
05:14:45.910 --> 05:14:45.920 align:start position:0%
quantify like behavioral incidents
 
05:14:49.430 --> 05:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
of one sort or another sexual aggression
 
05:14:51.590 --> 05:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
by any kind of violence anything that
 
05:14:52.948 --> 05:14:52.958 align:start position:0%
you might
 
05:14:55.030 --> 05:14:55.040 align:start position:0%
link with this in some way is that link
 
05:14:58.070 --> 05:14:58.080 align:start position:0%
made and is it used in the analysis of
 
05:15:00.470 --> 05:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
how you do things yes particular school
 
05:15:02.470 --> 05:15:02.480 align:start position:0%
uh it can be and again i'm going to use
 
05:15:05.110 --> 05:15:05.120 align:start position:0%
our example of drug use or drug abuse
 
05:15:07.350 --> 05:15:07.360 align:start position:0%
and we see this and now we know what we
 
05:15:09.830 --> 05:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
want what who we want to aim our efforts
 
05:15:12.070 --> 05:15:12.080 align:start position:0%
at let's say what group what age group
 
05:15:14.868 --> 05:15:14.878 align:start position:0%
what socio-economic group what have you
 
05:15:17.110 --> 05:15:17.120 align:start position:0%
certainly we see that uh and again
 
05:15:18.628 --> 05:15:18.638 align:start position:0%
working in conjunction with the school
 
05:15:20.868 --> 05:15:20.878 align:start position:0%
board with the teachers with the
 
05:15:23.350 --> 05:15:23.360 align:start position:0%
counselors with the social workers etc
 
05:15:25.910 --> 05:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
in the school system uh so we can do
 
05:15:27.670 --> 05:15:27.680 align:start position:0%
that uh you can take all this
 
05:15:29.350 --> 05:15:29.360 align:start position:0%
information you can apply any statistics
 
05:15:31.430 --> 05:15:31.440 align:start position:0%
you want to it for analysis try to
 
05:15:32.708 --> 05:15:32.718 align:start position:0%
correlate you know
 
05:15:34.868 --> 05:15:34.878 align:start position:0%
any kind of correlational statistics and
 
05:15:36.708 --> 05:15:36.718 align:start position:0%
certainly we can come up with something
 
05:15:39.110 --> 05:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
uh but in our case i i can speak best to
 
05:15:40.628 --> 05:15:40.638 align:start position:0%
the drug issues
 
05:15:41.750 --> 05:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much you're more than
 
05:15:43.830 --> 05:15:43.840 align:start position:0%
welcome thank you very much are there
 
05:15:47.510 --> 05:15:47.520 align:start position:0%
further questions representative tanner
 
05:15:49.270 --> 05:15:49.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and and thank you so
 
05:15:51.270 --> 05:15:51.280 align:start position:0%
much chief for coming today
 
05:15:53.350 --> 05:15:53.360 align:start position:0%
um anecdotally
 
05:15:54.390 --> 05:15:54.400 align:start position:0%
have you
 
05:15:57.670 --> 05:15:57.680 align:start position:0%
seen anything that leads you to believe
 
05:16:01.590 --> 05:16:01.600 align:start position:0%
that this uh survey is so skewed by
 
05:16:04.310 --> 05:16:04.320 align:start position:0%
people just not taking it seriously
 
05:16:06.310 --> 05:16:06.320 align:start position:0%
kids not taking it seriously
 
05:16:09.190 --> 05:16:09.200 align:start position:0%
i can say no and i have not
 
05:16:10.868 --> 05:16:10.878 align:start position:0%
yet in my
 
05:16:12.628 --> 05:16:12.638 align:start position:0%
13 years with franklin police department
 
05:16:15.110 --> 05:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
i have not heard that from anybody in
 
05:16:18.150 --> 05:16:18.160 align:start position:0%
the administration of the schools

have you had the opportunity to work
 
05:16:33.590 --> 05:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
with the department i know you've
 
05:16:36.390 --> 05:16:36.400 align:start position:0%
represented your association
 
05:16:36.400 --> 05:16:37.270 align:start position:0%
represented your association
um

05:16:37.270 --> 05:16:37.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:16:38.708 --> 05:16:38.718 align:start position:0%
have you had the opportunity to work

with doe in terms of the type and nature
 
05:16:44.550 --> 05:16:44.560 align:start position:0%
of questions which are asked on a youth
 
05:16:47.030 --> 05:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
risk behavior survey put out by the cdc
 
05:16:49.190 --> 05:16:49.200 align:start position:0%
the department has an opportunity to
 
05:16:52.310 --> 05:16:52.320 align:start position:0%
either put questions in or not
 
05:16:55.670 --> 05:16:55.680 align:start position:0%
has your has law enforcement
 
05:16:57.590 --> 05:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
been ever asked to
 
05:17:00.310 --> 05:17:00.320 align:start position:0%
you know or suggest
 
05:17:02.230 --> 05:17:02.240 align:start position:0%
issues that need address within that
 
05:17:04.070 --> 05:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
survey um
 
05:17:06.390 --> 05:17:06.400 align:start position:0%
to a large degree no i think what's
 
05:17:08.310 --> 05:17:08.320 align:start position:0%
happened with law enforcement is we've
 
05:17:10.230 --> 05:17:10.240 align:start position:0%
accepted the survey as it is and allowed
 
05:17:13.190 --> 05:17:13.200 align:start position:0%
the experts at cdc to design and develop
 
05:17:15.030 --> 05:17:15.040 align:start position:0%
the questionnaires and the questions
 
05:17:18.070 --> 05:17:18.080 align:start position:0%
themselves uh some years ago i did meet
 
05:17:20.550 --> 05:17:20.560 align:start position:0%
with the commissioner commissioner and
 
05:17:22.628 --> 05:17:22.638 align:start position:0%
discussed some of this with him in a
 
05:17:25.110 --> 05:17:25.120 align:start position:0%
very uh cursory way we i had some
 
05:17:27.270 --> 05:17:27.280 align:start position:0%
questions for him about this as well as
 
05:17:29.510 --> 05:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
other issues but other than that quite
 
05:17:31.590 --> 05:17:31.600 align:start position:0%
frankly no but i'm certain that we would
 
05:17:33.590 --> 05:17:33.600 align:start position:0%

opposition to house bill 1639 relative
 
05:18:25.510 --> 05:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
to the youth risk behavior survey in
 
05:18:27.830 --> 05:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
schools new futures is a nonpartisan
 
05:18:30.070 --> 05:18:30.080 align:start position:0%
nonprofit organization that advocates
 
05:18:32.070 --> 05:18:32.080 align:start position:0%
educates and collaborates to improve the
 
05:18:34.310 --> 05:18:34.320 align:start position:0%
health and wellness of granite staters
 
05:18:35.830 --> 05:18:35.840 align:start position:0%
we are dedicated to supporting and
 
05:18:37.430 --> 05:18:37.440 align:start position:0%
strengthening a comprehensive and
 
05:18:39.510 --> 05:18:39.520 align:start position:0%
integrated system of care for children
 
05:18:41.430 --> 05:18:41.440 align:start position:0%
and youth location officials use this
 
05:18:43.670 --> 05:18:43.680 align:start position:0%
anonymous data to track trends and
 
05:18:46.230 --> 05:18:46.240 align:start position:0%
develop health systems and policies that
 
05:18:48.788 --> 05:18:48.798 align:start position:0%
prevent and address risky and unhealthy
 
05:18:51.110 --> 05:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
behavior by high school students
 
05:18:53.670 --> 05:18:53.680 align:start position:0%
particularly in the age of covid it is
 
05:18:55.750 --> 05:18:55.760 align:start position:0%
important to recognize any changes in
 
05:18:58.470 --> 05:18:58.480 align:start position:0%
health behavior patterns in students so
 
05:19:00.628 --> 05:19:00.638 align:start position:0%
that schools parents and programs can
 
05:19:02.708 --> 05:19:02.718 align:start position:0%
adjust their strategies to support youth
 
05:19:05.830 --> 05:19:05.840 align:start position:0%
accordingly the yrbs is purposefully
 
05:19:08.230 --> 05:19:08.240 align:start position:0%
structured as an opt out program in
 
05:19:10.310 --> 05:19:10.320 align:start position:0%
order to maximize participation and
 
05:19:12.230 --> 05:19:12.240 align:start position:0%
expand data collection as widely as
 
05:19:14.230 --> 05:19:14.240 align:start position:0%
possible to capture trends among
 
05:19:16.230 --> 05:19:16.240 align:start position:0%
different population sets
 
05:19:17.910 --> 05:19:17.920 align:start position:0%
this was a recognition of the importance
 
05:19:19.910 --> 05:19:19.920 align:start position:0%
of gathering certain data in our schools
 
05:19:21.830 --> 05:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
and the fact that surveys that require
 
05:19:23.990 --> 05:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
active consent often end up with
 
05:19:26.628 --> 05:19:26.638 align:start position:0%
insufficient sample sized biased samples
 
05:19:29.750 --> 05:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
and unrepresented unrepresentation from
 
05:19:31.510 --> 05:19:31.520 align:start position:0%
under representation from individuals
 
05:19:33.270 --> 05:19:33.280 align:start position:0%
who are experiencing family stress due
 
05:19:35.750 --> 05:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
to poverty substance use violence and
 
05:19:37.750 --> 05:19:37.760 align:start position:0%
cultural differences
 
05:19:39.670 --> 05:19:39.680 align:start position:0%
by removing this exemption and shifting
 
05:19:42.390 --> 05:19:42.400 align:start position:0%
yrbs from opt out to opt-in this bill
 
05:19:44.390 --> 05:19:44.400 align:start position:0%
will negatively impact data collection
 
05:19:46.310 --> 05:19:46.320 align:start position:0%
and reduce the effectiveness of youth
 
05:19:47.830 --> 05:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
safety and wellness programs in new
 
05:19:50.070 --> 05:19:50.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire these programs require data
 
05:19:51.670 --> 05:19:51.680 align:start position:0%
collection at a local level to track
 
05:19:53.750 --> 05:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
student success
 
05:19:55.750 --> 05:19:55.760 align:start position:0%
identify issues or system gaps and
 
05:19:57.590 --> 05:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
comply with mandatory requirements from
 
05:19:59.030 --> 05:19:59.040 align:start position:0%
federal funders
 
05:20:00.868 --> 05:20:00.878 align:start position:0%
new futures unquestionably understands
 
05:20:02.948 --> 05:20:02.958 align:start position:0%
the desire to protect students through
 
05:20:04.628 --> 05:20:04.638 align:start position:0%
the active involvement of parents and
 
05:20:07.190 --> 05:20:07.200 align:start position:0%
guardians under the statute in its
 
05:20:09.430 --> 05:20:09.440 align:start position:0%
current form parents are still informed
 
05:20:11.190 --> 05:20:11.200 align:start position:0%
of when a survey is conducted in their
 
05:20:13.590 --> 05:20:13.600 align:start position:0%
child's school they are given access to
 
05:20:15.830 --> 05:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
survey materials and they are allowed to
 
05:20:17.990 --> 05:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
opt their child out of participation
 
05:20:20.550 --> 05:20:20.560 align:start position:0%
either in writing or electronically the
 
05:20:22.230 --> 05:20:22.240 align:start position:0%
statute as it's currently written
 
05:20:24.548 --> 05:20:24.558 align:start position:0%
strikes the proper balance between
 
05:20:26.470 --> 05:20:26.480 align:start position:0%
parental interest and the state's
 
05:20:28.548 --> 05:20:28.558 align:start position:0%
interest in tracking data and should not
 
05:20:31.430 --> 05:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
be changed through house bill 1639
 
05:20:33.590 --> 05:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
it would be irresponsible to severely
 
05:20:35.190 --> 05:20:35.200 align:start position:0%
limit data collection at a time where
 
05:20:36.708 --> 05:20:36.718 align:start position:0%
the health and safety of new hampshire's
 
05:20:38.390 --> 05:20:38.400 align:start position:0%
youth is so fragile
 
05:20:40.548 --> 05:20:40.558 align:start position:0%
for these reasons presented new futures
 
05:20:42.150 --> 05:20:42.160 align:start position:0%
strongly urges the committee to vote
 
05:20:44.470 --> 05:20:44.480 align:start position:0%
house bill 1639 and expediate to
 
05:20:46.548 --> 05:20:46.558 align:start position:0%
legislate and i will make a note that we
 
05:20:48.708 --> 05:20:48.718 align:start position:0%
had many of our prevention partners and
 
05:20:51.270 --> 05:20:51.280 align:start position:0%
providers sign on online that cannot be
 
05:20:53.990 --> 05:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
here today so through my testimony i
 
05:20:56.150 --> 05:20:56.160 align:start position:0%
also represent their opposition to this
 
05:20:58.788 --> 05:20:58.798 align:start position:0%
bill as well and i'm happy to take any
 
05:21:00.868 --> 05:21:00.878 align:start position:0%
questions if there are any
 
05:21:02.548 --> 05:21:02.558 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there any
 
05:21:02.558 --> 05:21:06.470 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there any
questions

05:21:06.470 --> 05:21:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:08.310 --> 05:21:08.320 align:start position:0%
represent moffat
 
05:21:10.070 --> 05:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
famous chair and thank you for being
 
05:21:11.990 --> 05:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
here and for taking my question
 
05:21:13.990 --> 05:21:14.000 align:start position:0%
so as i look at this this proposed
 
05:21:16.548 --> 05:21:16.558 align:start position:0%
measure there's three i see three things
 
05:21:18.070 --> 05:21:18.080 align:start position:0%
that the uh
 
05:21:19.830 --> 05:21:19.840 align:start position:0%
that the prime sports is looking to have
 
05:21:22.548 --> 05:21:22.558 align:start position:0%
happen he adds the word race is a list
 
05:21:22.558 --> 05:21:23.430 align:start position:0%
happen he adds the word race is a list
of

05:21:23.430 --> 05:21:23.440 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:21:26.070 --> 05:21:26.080 align:start position:0%
factors at the bottom
 
05:21:28.628 --> 05:21:28.638 align:start position:0%
he also says that the local school
 
05:21:32.708 --> 05:21:32.718 align:start position:0%
district should approve the yrbs survey
 
05:21:35.510 --> 05:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
and then the third thing is uh opt in
 
05:21:37.190 --> 05:21:37.200 align:start position:0%
rather than opt out
 
05:21:40.150 --> 05:21:40.160 align:start position:0%
so those are the three
 
05:21:41.990 --> 05:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
components of the three changes that i
 
05:21:43.750 --> 05:21:43.760 align:start position:0%
see here so
 
05:21:46.628 --> 05:21:46.638 align:start position:0%
i know you're in opposition to this
 
05:21:49.430 --> 05:21:49.440 align:start position:0%
so which of those components all three
 
05:21:50.708 --> 05:21:50.718 align:start position:0%
of them are where
 
05:21:52.548 --> 05:21:52.558 align:start position:0%
you're opposed to all three of them in
 
05:21:55.750 --> 05:21:55.760 align:start position:0%
particular um changing um it to an
 
05:21:58.230 --> 05:21:58.240 align:start position:0%
opt-in instead of an opt-out but at new
 
05:22:01.350 --> 05:22:01.360 align:start position:0%
futures we support the yrbs as it is how
 
05:22:01.360 --> 05:22:02.470 align:start position:0%
futures we support the yrbs as it is how
the

05:22:02.470 --> 05:22:02.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:22:04.788 --> 05:22:04.798 align:start position:0%
public health works with the cdc to have
 
05:22:07.350 --> 05:22:07.360 align:start position:0%
specific questions on the yrbs so to
 
05:22:10.150 --> 05:22:10.160 align:start position:0%
that extent we oppose any changes to the
 
05:22:12.150 --> 05:22:12.160 align:start position:0%
current statute
 
05:22:13.750 --> 05:22:13.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
05:22:16.708 --> 05:22:16.718 align:start position:0%
are there further questions
 
05:22:25.750 --> 05:22:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:27.590 --> 05:22:27.600 align:start position:0%

squeeze a little tighter than that
 
05:22:47.670 --> 05:22:47.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:50.628 --> 05:22:50.638 align:start position:0%

require ybs to use active parental

resources from both state and schools
 
05:25:39.670 --> 05:25:39.680 align:start position:0%

upping permission forms
 
05:25:49.910 --> 05:25:49.920 align:start position:0%
will be time consuming and will cause

additional burden to the survey process
 
05:25:57.110 --> 05:25:57.120 align:start position:0%
it is anticipated that up in requirement
 
05:26:01.110 --> 05:26:01.120 align:start position:0%
would create a significant barrier to

low response rate
 
05:26:19.110 --> 05:26:19.120 align:start position:0%
on surveys makes data less reliable and
 
05:26:21.910 --> 05:26:21.920 align:start position:0%
less variable and if the response rate
 
05:26:24.628 --> 05:26:24.638 align:start position:0%
goes below 60
 
05:26:27.510 --> 05:26:27.520 align:start position:0%

important data to guide public health
 
05:26:49.830 --> 05:26:49.840 align:start position:0%

community prevention programs
 
05:26:55.750 --> 05:26:55.760 align:start position:0%
as a result of the opening requirement
 
05:26:57.990 --> 05:26:58.000 align:start position:0%
will create a situation
 
05:27:00.230 --> 05:27:00.240 align:start position:0%
in which new hampshire communities and
 
05:27:03.350 --> 05:27:03.360 align:start position:0%

given the emphasis that new hampshire
 
05:27:10.470 --> 05:27:10.480 align:start position:0%
has placed on eliminating and preventing
 
05:27:13.110 --> 05:27:13.120 align:start position:0%

it is
 
05:27:22.310 --> 05:27:22.320 align:start position:0%
imperative that we should not hinder our

in the way of meaningful data collection
 
05:27:30.948 --> 05:27:30.958 align:start position:0%
the school district
 
05:27:34.470 --> 05:27:34.480 align:start position:0%
may not have the ybs data excuse me the
 
05:27:37.270 --> 05:27:37.280 align:start position:0%
school district by not having ibs data
 
05:27:39.910 --> 05:27:39.920 align:start position:0%
may not have a sufficient resource that
 
05:27:42.310 --> 05:27:42.320 align:start position:0%

being here today
 
05:29:16.548 --> 05:29:16.558 align:start position:0%
one question one of the key items with
 
05:29:18.788 --> 05:29:18.798 align:start position:0%
the proposed legislation
 
05:29:21.030 --> 05:29:21.040 align:start position:0%
is an opt-in
 
05:29:23.590 --> 05:29:23.600 align:start position:0%
participation for
 
05:29:27.430 --> 05:29:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:30.310 --> 05:29:30.320 align:start position:0%
based on your testimony it looks like
 
05:29:33.990 --> 05:29:34.000 align:start position:0%
school boards have the freedom to vote
 
05:29:35.350 --> 05:29:35.360 align:start position:0%
for either
 
05:29:38.788 --> 05:29:38.798 align:start position:0%
an opt-in survey or an opt-out survey am
 
05:29:38.798 --> 05:29:39.590 align:start position:0%
an opt-in survey or an opt-out survey am
i

05:29:39.590 --> 05:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
i
 
05:29:42.788 --> 05:29:42.798 align:start position:0%
understanding that correctly yes so we
 
05:29:45.270 --> 05:29:45.280 align:start position:0%
the current practice that we are taking
 
05:29:48.948 --> 05:29:48.958 align:start position:0%
is up out so we don't at school to say
 
05:29:51.350 --> 05:29:51.360 align:start position:0%
you need to open or into about we give
 
05:29:53.270 --> 05:29:53.280 align:start position:0%
the school board to decide whether they
 
05:29:56.070 --> 05:29:56.080 align:start position:0%
want to participate wire bs or they want
 
05:29:59.270 --> 05:29:59.280 align:start position:0%
to take upping of our option we did have
 
05:30:02.548 --> 05:30:02.558 align:start position:0%
a school in the past chose up in
 
05:30:05.510 --> 05:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
approach and the state of public health
 
05:30:08.628 --> 05:30:08.638 align:start position:0%
provided up in templates for them to be
 
05:30:11.190 --> 05:30:11.200 align:start position:0%
able to communicate it with parents
 
05:30:13.510 --> 05:30:13.520 align:start position:0%
but in the next survey cycle that
 
05:30:16.708 --> 05:30:16.718 align:start position:0%
particular school chose up out option
 
05:30:19.110 --> 05:30:19.120 align:start position:0%
because they didn't get enough students
 
05:30:22.150 --> 05:30:22.160 align:start position:0%
or enough are being formed to be able to
 
05:30:27.190 --> 05:30:27.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:29.670 --> 05:30:29.680 align:start position:0%
follow if i could yes go ahead thank you
 
05:30:29.680 --> 05:30:30.948 align:start position:0%
follow if i could yes go ahead thank you
um

05:30:30.948 --> 05:30:30.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:30:33.270 --> 05:30:33.280 align:start position:0%
so um
 
05:30:35.510 --> 05:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
there was just one school to your
 
05:30:39.270 --> 05:30:39.280 align:start position:0%
knowledge that shows an opt-in
 
05:30:39.280 --> 05:30:41.590 align:start position:0%
knowledge that shows an opt-in
participation

05:30:41.590 --> 05:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
participation
 
05:30:42.788 --> 05:30:42.798 align:start position:0%
and they
 
05:30:47.750 --> 05:30:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:48.628 --> 05:30:48.638 align:start position:0%
do you
 
05:30:51.270 --> 05:30:51.280 align:start position:0%
do all schools know that you have
 
05:30:51.280 --> 05:30:52.868 align:start position:0%
do all schools know that you have
provided

05:30:52.868 --> 05:30:52.878 align:start position:0%
provided
 
05:30:55.510 --> 05:30:55.520 align:start position:0%
for an opt-in
 
05:30:58.708 --> 05:30:58.718 align:start position:0%
based on a school board vote yes
 
05:31:01.990 --> 05:31:02.000 align:start position:0%
we provide training ahead of the survey
 
05:31:05.190 --> 05:31:05.200 align:start position:0%
started to the school element traders
 
05:31:08.310 --> 05:31:08.320 align:start position:0%
and just because of covert this year the
 
05:31:10.948 --> 05:31:10.958 align:start position:0%
training program that we provide is like
 
05:31:13.510 --> 05:31:13.520 align:start position:0%
online uh documents that we posted
 
05:31:15.830 --> 05:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
online for school administrators to be
 
05:31:17.830 --> 05:31:17.840 align:start position:0%
able to look at the slides and take
 
05:31:20.230 --> 05:31:20.240 align:start position:0%
questions and then communicate with us
 
05:31:21.990 --> 05:31:22.000 align:start position:0%
how they would like to administer the
 
05:31:24.948 --> 05:31:24.958 align:start position:0%
survey in their schools so we do have
 
05:31:27.590 --> 05:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
upping templates as well as upload
 
05:31:30.070 --> 05:31:30.080 align:start position:0%
template provide to the schools if they
 
05:31:30.080 --> 05:31:32.390 align:start position:0%
template provide to the schools if they
require

05:31:32.390 --> 05:31:32.400 align:start position:0%
require
 
05:31:33.830 --> 05:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
05:31:37.670 --> 05:31:37.680 align:start position:0%
thank you very much our representative
 
05:31:39.190 --> 05:31:39.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
05:31:41.270 --> 05:31:41.280 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
05:31:42.948 --> 05:31:42.958 align:start position:0%
in your experience
 
05:31:45.670 --> 05:31:45.680 align:start position:0%
or the experience of the department uh
 
05:31:47.750 --> 05:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
do you find that the schools find this
 
05:31:49.510 --> 05:31:49.520 align:start position:0%
information valuable
 
05:31:52.390 --> 05:31:52.400 align:start position:0%
yes we do have schools um
 
05:31:55.030 --> 05:31:55.040 align:start position:0%
they find the information very very
 
05:31:58.310 --> 05:31:58.320 align:start position:0%
valuable so we provide a community level
 
05:32:00.470 --> 05:32:00.480 align:start position:0%
report to school districts to
 
05:32:02.868 --> 05:32:02.878 align:start position:0%
superintendents directly
 
05:32:05.270 --> 05:32:05.280 align:start position:0%
so for community level report we do not
 
05:32:08.548 --> 05:32:08.558 align:start position:0%
release to anyone except superintendent
 
05:32:11.350 --> 05:32:11.360 align:start position:0%
and if if someone else would like to
 
05:32:14.310 --> 05:32:14.320 align:start position:0%
request the specific community levels
 
05:32:16.708 --> 05:32:16.718 align:start position:0%
uh report we will need to get a consent
 
05:32:18.788 --> 05:32:18.798 align:start position:0%
from superintendent so that we can read
 
05:32:20.628 --> 05:32:20.638 align:start position:0%
this to that particular individual who
 
05:32:22.310 --> 05:32:22.320 align:start position:0%
requested a survey
 
05:32:22.320 --> 05:32:23.350 align:start position:0%
requested a survey
result

05:32:23.350 --> 05:32:23.360 align:start position:0%
result
 
05:32:26.390 --> 05:32:26.400 align:start position:0%
so some schools they also posted their
 
05:32:28.948 --> 05:32:28.958 align:start position:0%
community level uh report on their own
 
05:32:31.590 --> 05:32:31.600 align:start position:0%
website um you know in my knowledge that
 
05:32:34.390 --> 05:32:34.400 align:start position:0%
you um share the information with their
 
05:32:35.830 --> 05:32:35.840 align:start position:0%
own communities
 
05:32:38.628 --> 05:32:38.638 align:start position:0%
and schools as far as i know and also in
 
05:32:41.030 --> 05:32:41.040 align:start position:0%
my knowledge that has some grand
 
05:32:43.910 --> 05:32:43.920 align:start position:0%
requirement and they utilize the ybs
 
05:32:45.270 --> 05:32:45.280 align:start position:0%
result to
 
05:32:46.628 --> 05:32:46.638 align:start position:0%
for their
 
05:32:50.230 --> 05:32:50.240 align:start position:0%
prevention or for their curriculum etc
 
05:32:53.270 --> 05:32:53.280 align:start position:0%
so yes to your question
 
05:32:55.270 --> 05:32:55.280 align:start position:0%
schools find the
 
05:32:59.430 --> 05:32:59.440 align:start position:0%
yrbs data is valuable yes
 
05:33:00.948 --> 05:33:00.958 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
05:33:03.750 --> 05:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
yes represent litchfield thank you
 
05:33:06.470 --> 05:33:06.480 align:start position:0%
if i may i have two questions the the
 
05:33:07.990 --> 05:33:08.000 align:start position:0%
first question is
 
05:33:10.070 --> 05:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
would it be fair to say that we're kind
 
05:33:12.230 --> 05:33:12.240 align:start position:0%
of making a large assumption here that
 
05:33:14.230 --> 05:33:14.240 align:start position:0%
this information is being disseminated
 
05:33:16.548 --> 05:33:16.558 align:start position:0%
to the school board whether or not they
 
05:33:18.070 --> 05:33:18.080 align:start position:0%
have the option
 
05:33:20.788 --> 05:33:20.798 align:start position:0%
um to even have this survey or whether
 
05:33:23.670 --> 05:33:23.680 align:start position:0%
or not it's opt-in or opt-out
 
05:33:25.190 --> 05:33:25.200 align:start position:0%
and would it be fair to say that it's a
 
05:33:27.110 --> 05:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
very large assumption to make at this
 
05:33:30.310 --> 05:33:30.320 align:start position:0%
point in time that parents are just
 
05:33:32.628 --> 05:33:32.638 align:start position:0%
choosing not to respond versus they
 
05:33:34.230 --> 05:33:34.240 align:start position:0%
really don't want their children taking
 
05:33:35.670 --> 05:33:35.680 align:start position:0%
this survey
 
05:33:37.670 --> 05:33:37.680 align:start position:0%
so for the first question
 
05:33:40.628 --> 05:33:40.638 align:start position:0%
if i understand your question correctly
 
05:33:44.948 --> 05:33:44.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:47.270 --> 05:33:47.280 align:start position:0%
the vote for some schools excuse me i
 
05:33:49.670 --> 05:33:49.680 align:start position:0%
should say that for some schools in my
 
05:33:51.670 --> 05:33:51.680 align:start position:0%
knowledge that they
 
05:33:54.150 --> 05:33:54.160 align:start position:0%
work with the school board to vote
 
05:33:56.548 --> 05:33:56.558 align:start position:0%
whether they want to have a yrbs this
 
05:33:58.548 --> 05:33:58.558 align:start position:0%
year or not
 
05:34:00.628 --> 05:34:00.638 align:start position:0%
and then if they vote to
 
05:34:03.750 --> 05:34:03.760 align:start position:0%
participate yrbs then they will let us
 
05:34:05.350 --> 05:34:05.360 align:start position:0%
know that they know whether they would
 
05:34:08.830 --> 05:34:08.840 align:start position:0%
like to take upping opt-out
 
05:34:12.470 --> 05:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
approach did i answer your question if i
 
05:34:14.390 --> 05:34:14.400 align:start position:0%
didn't get it right
 
05:34:16.310 --> 05:34:16.320 align:start position:0%
you did i i can tell you've been on
 
05:34:18.390 --> 05:34:18.400 align:start position:0%
school boards 15 years now and not once
 
05:34:19.670 --> 05:34:19.680 align:start position:0%
have i ever been asked that question
 
05:34:19.680 --> 05:34:20.788 align:start position:0%
have i ever been asked that question
though

05:34:20.788 --> 05:34:20.798 align:start position:0%
though
 
05:34:20.798 --> 05:34:22.070 align:start position:0%
though
okay

05:34:22.070 --> 05:34:22.080 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:34:24.310 --> 05:34:24.320 align:start position:0%
may i follow up with a second question
 
05:34:25.590 --> 05:34:25.600 align:start position:0%
okay um
 
05:34:27.910 --> 05:34:27.920 align:start position:0%
my second question is
 
05:34:29.830 --> 05:34:29.840 align:start position:0%
is the fact that we are being told that
 
05:34:31.910 --> 05:34:31.920 align:start position:0%
this information is being kept
 
05:34:35.030 --> 05:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
confidential um we have a wide range of
 
05:34:39.110 --> 05:34:39.120 align:start position:0%
size in schools throughout this state
 
05:34:40.390 --> 05:34:40.400 align:start position:0%
which would lead me to believe that
 
05:34:42.150 --> 05:34:42.160 align:start position:0%
there could be privacy issues for
 
05:34:42.160 --> 05:34:44.390 align:start position:0%
there could be privacy issues for
example

05:34:44.390 --> 05:34:44.400 align:start position:0%
example
 
05:34:47.030 --> 05:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
how confidential is this if
 
05:34:49.030 --> 05:34:49.040 align:start position:0%
so far i'm hearing the results are being
 
05:34:51.350 --> 05:34:51.360 align:start position:0%
given to the superintendent the police
 
05:34:53.270 --> 05:34:53.280 align:start position:0%
department the department of health and
 
05:34:55.670 --> 05:34:55.680 align:start position:0%
human services and being posted on the
 
05:34:57.590 --> 05:34:57.600 align:start position:0%
school website
 
05:35:00.390 --> 05:35:00.400 align:start position:0%
those are not the survey itself those
 
05:35:02.628 --> 05:35:02.638 align:start position:0%
are the aggregated data
 
05:35:04.868 --> 05:35:04.878 align:start position:0%
the report that we collected from the
 
05:35:08.310 --> 05:35:08.320 align:start position:0%
survey result we aggregated and then do
 
05:35:08.320 --> 05:35:09.510 align:start position:0%
survey result we aggregated and then do
the

05:35:09.510 --> 05:35:09.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:35:12.868 --> 05:35:12.878 align:start position:0%
time trend chart or by gender
 
05:35:15.510 --> 05:35:15.520 align:start position:0%
on this kind of graphic information
 
05:35:18.788 --> 05:35:18.798 align:start position:0%
versus report to the school
 
05:35:21.670 --> 05:35:21.680 align:start position:0%
so it's not a survey itself it's not the
 
05:35:23.030 --> 05:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
record level
 
05:35:25.670 --> 05:35:25.680 align:start position:0%
that students um
 
05:35:28.788 --> 05:35:28.798 align:start position:0%
answered for each question no we don't
 
05:35:31.590 --> 05:35:31.600 align:start position:0%
realize that at all
 
05:35:33.110 --> 05:35:33.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:35:35.350 --> 05:35:35.360 align:start position:0%
for the question representative porter
 
05:35:36.788 --> 05:35:36.798 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
05:35:39.510 --> 05:35:39.520 align:start position:0%
taking my question um do you know in the
 
05:35:42.628 --> 05:35:42.638 align:start position:0%
schools that are doing the opt out
 
05:35:44.390 --> 05:35:44.400 align:start position:0%
what percentage
 
05:35:47.270 --> 05:35:47.280 align:start position:0%
of families are opt out
 
05:35:50.390 --> 05:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
do you know the average of an opt-out
 
05:35:53.670 --> 05:35:53.680 align:start position:0%
this product information is not um
 
05:35:56.230 --> 05:35:56.240 align:start position:0%
communicated with the state so we give
 
05:35:58.310 --> 05:35:58.320 align:start position:0%
the schools on
 
05:35:59.990 --> 05:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
for their own to
 
05:36:03.110 --> 05:36:03.120 align:start position:0%
work on the upping up doubt on we do not
 
05:36:03.120 --> 05:36:03.910 align:start position:0%
work on the upping up doubt on we do not
know

05:36:03.910 --> 05:36:03.920 align:start position:0%
know
 
05:36:06.470 --> 05:36:06.480 align:start position:0%
the percentage or the number of the
 
05:36:10.708 --> 05:36:10.718 align:start position:0%
upping of about in the particular school
 
05:36:13.590 --> 05:36:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:15.990 --> 05:36:16.000 align:start position:0%
i i have a question for you
 
05:36:17.830 --> 05:36:17.840 align:start position:0%
i'm curious to know if the results of
 
05:36:19.590 --> 05:36:19.600 align:start position:0%
the survey
 
05:36:21.670 --> 05:36:21.680 align:start position:0%
are made available in other words
 
05:36:23.190 --> 05:36:23.200 align:start position:0%
certain groups are getting ahold of this
 
05:36:23.200 --> 05:36:24.390 align:start position:0%
certain groups are getting ahold of this
information

05:36:24.390 --> 05:36:24.400 align:start position:0%
information
 
05:36:26.868 --> 05:36:26.878 align:start position:0%
but are the results for a particular
 
05:36:29.030 --> 05:36:29.040 align:start position:0%
school or school district posted on
 
05:36:31.110 --> 05:36:31.120 align:start position:0%
their website so that
 
05:36:33.430 --> 05:36:33.440 align:start position:0%
all can see where we're going in terms
 
05:36:35.830 --> 05:36:35.840 align:start position:0%
of any particular question if you know
 
05:36:37.670 --> 05:36:37.680 align:start position:0%
track it back over the years
 
05:36:41.590 --> 05:36:41.600 align:start position:0%
so for the uh data dissemination yrbs
 
05:36:43.750 --> 05:36:43.760 align:start position:0%
has two portions the first portion is
 
05:36:46.708 --> 05:36:46.718 align:start position:0%
the sample size which is
 
05:36:49.910 --> 05:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
for each score or for each area we pick
 
05:36:52.708 --> 05:36:52.718 align:start position:0%
the samples and then the samples doesn't
 
05:36:56.070 --> 05:36:56.080 align:start position:0%
mean doesn't represent a specific score
 
05:36:59.750 --> 05:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
the sample size is about maybe
 
05:37:01.910 --> 05:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
on top of my head like one third of the
 
05:37:04.708 --> 05:37:04.718 align:start position:0%
total high school population we send it
 
05:37:06.310 --> 05:37:06.320 align:start position:0%
to cdc
 
05:37:08.470 --> 05:37:08.480 align:start position:0%
with no school in um
 
05:37:10.548 --> 05:37:10.558 align:start position:0%
information with no class information in
 
05:37:13.190 --> 05:37:13.200 align:start position:0%
yet then cdc will connect with other
 
05:37:16.230 --> 05:37:16.240 align:start position:0%
states together and then post make the
 
05:37:18.628 --> 05:37:18.638 align:start position:0%
data analysis and make the results
 
05:37:22.070 --> 05:37:22.080 align:start position:0%
available to look at the key point key
 
05:37:24.548 --> 05:37:24.558 align:start position:0%
indicator for example the percentage of
 
05:37:24.558 --> 05:37:25.590 align:start position:0%
indicator for example the percentage of
students

05:37:25.590 --> 05:37:25.600 align:start position:0%
students
 
05:37:28.788 --> 05:37:28.798 align:start position:0%
who reported or who answered
 
05:37:30.708 --> 05:37:30.718 align:start position:0%
they they were asian
 
05:37:32.868 --> 05:37:32.878 align:start position:0%
these type of questions available on the
 
05:37:35.910 --> 05:37:35.920 align:start position:0%
cdc website the community level report
 
05:37:38.310 --> 05:37:38.320 align:start position:0%
that i mentioned to the superintendent
 
05:37:38.320 --> 05:37:39.670 align:start position:0%
that i mentioned to the superintendent
specifically

05:37:39.670 --> 05:37:39.680 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
05:37:40.868 --> 05:37:40.878 align:start position:0%
is the
 
05:37:43.110 --> 05:37:43.120 align:start position:0%
information for each individual question
 
05:37:44.788 --> 05:37:44.798 align:start position:0%
for the specific
 
05:37:47.270 --> 05:37:47.280 align:start position:0%
survey year for each individual question
 
05:37:51.270 --> 05:37:51.280 align:start position:0%
to that school only we also put the
 
05:37:53.670 --> 05:37:53.680 align:start position:0%
state level data as well as the region
 
05:37:56.150 --> 05:37:56.160 align:start position:0%
level data as a comparison for
 
05:37:58.390 --> 05:37:58.400 align:start position:0%
superintendent to understand
 
05:38:00.868 --> 05:38:00.878 align:start position:0%
how the school performed or after the
 
05:38:02.390 --> 05:38:02.400 align:start position:0%
survey result
 
05:38:04.628 --> 05:38:04.638 align:start position:0%
analysis analyzed
 
05:38:07.590 --> 05:38:07.600 align:start position:0%
how the school performed compared to
 
05:38:11.110 --> 05:38:11.120 align:start position:0%
the state level or the region level
 
05:38:12.150 --> 05:38:12.160 align:start position:0%
and that
 
05:38:15.030 --> 05:38:15.040 align:start position:0%
that report is only
 
05:38:17.350 --> 05:38:17.360 align:start position:0%
sent delivered to the superintendent and
 
05:38:19.590 --> 05:38:19.600 align:start position:0%
it's up to school how they would like to
 
05:38:21.990 --> 05:38:22.000 align:start position:0%
utilize their own specific community
 
05:38:24.310 --> 05:38:24.320 align:start position:0%
level report do you know of any schools
 
05:38:26.390 --> 05:38:26.400 align:start position:0%
in this state that are
 
05:38:28.390 --> 05:38:28.400 align:start position:0%
posting the aggregated data for that
 
05:38:30.628 --> 05:38:30.638 align:start position:0%
school or school district and posting it
 
05:38:31.830 --> 05:38:31.840 align:start position:0%
on the web
 
05:38:34.788 --> 05:38:34.798 align:start position:0%
as far as i know i think the bedford
 
05:38:36.948 --> 05:38:36.958 align:start position:0%
bedford high school
 
05:38:38.150 --> 05:38:38.160 align:start position:0%
one school
 
05:38:41.190 --> 05:38:41.200 align:start position:0%
i i didn't look into all the schools
 
05:38:44.628 --> 05:38:44.638 align:start position:0%
but bedford high schools um they they as
 
05:38:47.030 --> 05:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
far as i know that they post their
 
05:38:48.948 --> 05:38:48.958 align:start position:0%
community level report on their own
 
05:38:48.958 --> 05:38:52.310 align:start position:0%
community level report on their own
website

05:38:52.310 --> 05:38:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:55.350 --> 05:38:55.360 align:start position:0%
that's interesting thank you very much
 
05:38:57.510 --> 05:38:57.520 align:start position:0%
representative tanner
 
05:38:59.830 --> 05:38:59.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i was wondering if
 
05:39:02.230 --> 05:39:02.240 align:start position:0%
you could
 
05:39:04.470 --> 05:39:04.480 align:start position:0%
explain any kind of benefit that you
 
05:39:06.868 --> 05:39:06.878 align:start position:0%
have seen come out of this survey as far
 
05:39:10.948 --> 05:39:10.958 align:start position:0%
as perhaps programs that hhs has done or
 
05:39:13.270 --> 05:39:13.280 align:start position:0%
grants that they've given or you know
 
05:39:15.750 --> 05:39:15.760 align:start position:0%
some concrete you know why are we doing
 
05:39:17.350 --> 05:39:17.360 align:start position:0%
this and what are the benefits for it
 
05:39:19.270 --> 05:39:19.280 align:start position:0%
because it seems like we're more focused
 
05:39:21.190 --> 05:39:21.200 align:start position:0%
on how it's being done
 
05:39:25.590 --> 05:39:25.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:27.030 --> 05:39:27.040 align:start position:0%
hi chairman lauden members of the
 
05:39:28.788 --> 05:39:28.798 align:start position:0%
committee my name is abby rogers i'm the
 
05:39:30.230 --> 05:39:30.240 align:start position:0%
legislative liaison for the division of
 
05:39:31.990 --> 05:39:32.000 align:start position:0%
public health services i think i can
 
05:39:34.150 --> 05:39:34.160 align:start position:0%
take that question um the the data
 
05:39:35.670 --> 05:39:35.680 align:start position:0%
that's collected
 
05:39:38.390 --> 05:39:38.400 align:start position:0%
by the yrbs is used to determine both
 
05:39:40.548 --> 05:39:40.558 align:start position:0%
federal grants and grants to affect
 
05:39:43.110 --> 05:39:43.120 align:start position:0%
substance use disorders um other mental
 
05:39:44.868 --> 05:39:44.878 align:start position:0%
health treatments uh
 
05:39:47.830 --> 05:39:47.840 align:start position:0%
to to combat vaping alcohol use as i
 
05:39:49.990 --> 05:39:50.000 align:start position:0%
said substance use disorders so the data
 
05:39:52.948 --> 05:39:52.958 align:start position:0%
used is uh better to inform uh
 
05:39:54.868 --> 05:39:54.878 align:start position:0%
what is going on in the schools and then
 
05:39:55.990 --> 05:39:56.000 align:start position:0%
you know of course that affects the
 
05:39:57.350 --> 05:39:57.360 align:start position:0%
greater community and those grants are
 
05:39:59.350 --> 05:39:59.360 align:start position:0%
given based on that data so they were
 
05:40:01.110 --> 05:40:01.120 align:start position:0%
able to match the needs identified in
 
05:40:03.350 --> 05:40:03.360 align:start position:0%
the data with the yrbs with with what's
 
05:40:05.110 --> 05:40:05.120 align:start position:0%
going on in the school districts and
 
05:40:06.310 --> 05:40:06.320 align:start position:0%
those grant funds are given and that's
 
05:40:08.230 --> 05:40:08.240 align:start position:0%
why it's especially important not to
 
05:40:09.590 --> 05:40:09.600 align:start position:0%
make the survey
 
05:40:11.270 --> 05:40:11.280 align:start position:0%
an opt-in because we would lose that
 
05:40:13.270 --> 05:40:13.280 align:start position:0%
data and potentially lose those federal
 
05:40:14.708 --> 05:40:14.718 align:start position:0%
dollars to help school districts and the
 
05:40:14.718 --> 05:40:17.270 align:start position:0%
dollars to help school districts and the
communities

05:40:17.270 --> 05:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
communities
 
05:40:17.280 --> 05:40:18.788 align:start position:0%
communities
yes

05:40:18.788 --> 05:40:18.798 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:40:21.910 --> 05:40:21.920 align:start position:0%
um so that's that's from your standpoint
 
05:40:23.910 --> 05:40:23.920 align:start position:0%
at the at the state government level
 
05:40:26.230 --> 05:40:26.240 align:start position:0%
that you know it's grants kind of thing
 
05:40:28.230 --> 05:40:28.240 align:start position:0%
and we heard from the police chief of
 
05:40:31.030 --> 05:40:31.040 align:start position:0%
franklin about how it affects how they
 
05:40:33.510 --> 05:40:33.520 align:start position:0%
are dealing and also grants that they
 
05:40:34.708 --> 05:40:34.718 align:start position:0%
get locally
 
05:40:34.718 --> 05:40:35.590 align:start position:0%
get locally
um

05:40:35.590 --> 05:40:35.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:40:37.590 --> 05:40:37.600 align:start position:0%
you know to to approach particularly the
 
05:40:40.310 --> 05:40:40.320 align:start position:0%
drug problem but other problems as well
 
05:40:42.230 --> 05:40:42.240 align:start position:0%
do you have any feedback from from
 
05:40:43.910 --> 05:40:43.920 align:start position:0%
schools or maybe we have other people
 
05:40:45.510 --> 05:40:45.520 align:start position:0%
that are going to come up and talk that
 
05:40:47.910 --> 05:40:47.920 align:start position:0%
that i can also ask that question that
 
05:40:49.350 --> 05:40:49.360 align:start position:0%
that the information has been
 
05:40:51.110 --> 05:40:51.120 align:start position:0%
particularly helpful for their school
 
05:40:52.070 --> 05:40:52.080 align:start position:0%
and that
 
05:40:53.910 --> 05:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
that within their school district they
 
05:40:57.110 --> 05:40:57.120 align:start position:0%
made a significant changes or involved
 
05:40:58.548 --> 05:40:58.558 align:start position:0%
programs uh
 
05:41:01.030 --> 05:41:01.040 align:start position:0%
that actually were a result of some of
 
05:41:02.628 --> 05:41:02.638 align:start position:0%
the information from the
 
05:41:04.628 --> 05:41:04.638 align:start position:0%
survey sure thank you for the question
 
05:41:07.910 --> 05:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
would you have any specifics on that
 
05:41:12.390 --> 05:41:12.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:15.670 --> 05:41:15.680 align:start position:0%
answer more on your first questions
 
05:41:19.190 --> 05:41:19.200 align:start position:0%
how data has been used so for example
 
05:41:21.830 --> 05:41:21.840 align:start position:0%
like mapping data for youth we also
 
05:41:24.708 --> 05:41:24.718 align:start position:0%
utilize in some legislative activities
 
05:41:27.350 --> 05:41:27.360 align:start position:0%
to provide this kind of report in order
 
05:41:30.708 --> 05:41:30.718 align:start position:0%
to support or to provide more detailed
 
05:41:32.868 --> 05:41:32.878 align:start position:0%
information on the legislative
 
05:41:37.350 --> 05:41:37.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:39.030 --> 05:41:39.040 align:start position:0%
uh yes we were able to use some data
 
05:41:40.788 --> 05:41:40.798 align:start position:0%
from the yrbs to better inform
 
05:41:43.110 --> 05:41:43.120 align:start position:0%
legislators on the effect of raising the
 
05:41:46.230 --> 05:41:46.240 align:start position:0%
tobacco purchasing age to 21 for example
 
05:41:48.628 --> 05:41:48.638 align:start position:0%
we use that data in that instance and we
 
05:41:50.230 --> 05:41:50.240 align:start position:0%
use it a lot with our
 
05:41:51.990 --> 05:41:52.000 align:start position:0%
any legislation having to do with mental
 
05:41:53.990 --> 05:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
health disorders and certainly substance
 
05:41:56.070 --> 05:41:56.080 align:start position:0%
abuse and uh prevention treatments that
 
05:41:58.070 --> 05:41:58.080 align:start position:0%
are necessary um i don't i'm not sure if
 
05:41:59.590 --> 05:41:59.600 align:start position:0%
there is um someone representing the
 
05:42:01.670 --> 05:42:01.680 align:start position:0%
schools here um for your second question
 
05:42:03.190 --> 05:42:03.200 align:start position:0%
so i can't answer that question
 
05:42:04.708 --> 05:42:04.718 align:start position:0%
specifically but thank you for the
 
05:42:06.708 --> 05:42:06.718 align:start position:0%
question um
 
05:42:08.868 --> 05:42:08.878 align:start position:0%
and i do have my own point of my own to
 
05:42:09.990 --> 05:42:10.000 align:start position:0%
make i don't know if the committee has
 
05:42:11.510 --> 05:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
any more questions before i get to that
 
05:42:13.270 --> 05:42:13.280 align:start position:0%
yes i have a question and i think
 
05:42:15.270 --> 05:42:15.280 align:start position:0%
represent cordelia may have one too
 
05:42:18.310 --> 05:42:18.320 align:start position:0%
um i'm curious no so we have this the
 
05:42:20.230 --> 05:42:20.240 align:start position:0%
results of the survey provided to the
 
05:42:22.390 --> 05:42:22.400 align:start position:0%
superintendent and to
 
05:42:24.788 --> 05:42:24.798 align:start position:0%
i would hope the school board as well
 
05:42:27.590 --> 05:42:27.600 align:start position:0%
unless it's held by the superintendent
 
05:42:30.230 --> 05:42:30.240 align:start position:0%
to help be helpful within the district
 
05:42:32.230 --> 05:42:32.240 align:start position:0%
or school as has been just mentioned to
 
05:42:32.240 --> 05:42:34.708 align:start position:0%
or school as has been just mentioned to
us

05:42:34.708 --> 05:42:34.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:37.750 --> 05:42:37.760 align:start position:0%
if it's not posted to the community how
 
05:42:40.390 --> 05:42:40.400 align:start position:0%
is the community going to engage and be
 
05:42:40.400 --> 05:42:41.670 align:start position:0%
is the community going to engage and be
partners

05:42:41.670 --> 05:42:41.680 align:start position:0%
partners
 
05:42:43.750 --> 05:42:43.760 align:start position:0%
in addressing
 
05:42:46.070 --> 05:42:46.080 align:start position:0%
some of the information that's been
 
05:42:48.948 --> 05:42:48.958 align:start position:0%
identified on this survey without that
 
05:42:51.910 --> 05:42:51.920 align:start position:0%
being posted um
 
05:42:53.270 --> 05:42:53.280 align:start position:0%
and i have a second question but maybe
 
05:42:54.788 --> 05:42:54.798 align:start position:0%
you can ask that answer that first one
 
05:42:54.798 --> 05:42:57.350 align:start position:0%
you can ask that answer that first one
first

05:42:57.350 --> 05:42:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:59.350 --> 05:42:59.360 align:start position:0%
yes i can answer the first question so
 
05:43:02.310 --> 05:43:02.320 align:start position:0%
other than the customizer community
 
05:43:05.510 --> 05:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
level report we also take data requests
 
05:43:05.520 --> 05:43:06.788 align:start position:0%
level report we also take data requests
to

05:43:06.788 --> 05:43:06.798 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:43:09.190 --> 05:43:09.200 align:start position:0%
do the data analysis on the specific
 
05:43:09.200 --> 05:43:10.390 align:start position:0%
do the data analysis on the specific
area

05:43:10.390 --> 05:43:10.400 align:start position:0%
area
 
05:43:13.590 --> 05:43:13.600 align:start position:0%
on the specific topics as well so for
 
05:43:16.868 --> 05:43:16.878 align:start position:0%
communities who focused on maybe drug
 
05:43:19.750 --> 05:43:19.760 align:start position:0%
misuse they they are interested in
 
05:43:23.110 --> 05:43:23.120 align:start position:0%
certain questions in the certain areas
 
05:43:25.670 --> 05:43:25.680 align:start position:0%
so in that way we are able to customize
 
05:43:28.948 --> 05:43:28.958 align:start position:0%
as a table format or chart visualization
 
05:43:31.430 --> 05:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
format to provide this information for
 
05:43:33.350 --> 05:43:33.360 align:start position:0%
their own communities and with the
 
05:43:35.910 --> 05:43:35.920 align:start position:0%
questions that they are interested
 
05:43:38.310 --> 05:43:38.320 align:start position:0%
we aggregate more than three or four
 
05:43:41.190 --> 05:43:41.200 align:start position:0%
schools together we do not provide the
 
05:43:44.150 --> 05:43:44.160 align:start position:0%
individual schools a statistic analysis
 
05:43:44.160 --> 05:43:44.948 align:start position:0%
individual schools a statistic analysis
to

05:43:44.948 --> 05:43:44.958 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:43:47.750 --> 05:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
the um to the data request so it's
 
05:43:50.070 --> 05:43:50.080 align:start position:0%
always the area
 
05:43:52.310 --> 05:43:52.320 align:start position:0%
community aggregation report that we
 
05:43:55.670 --> 05:43:55.680 align:start position:0%
provide so other than the
 
05:43:57.510 --> 05:43:57.520 align:start position:0%
excuse me other than the community level
 
05:43:59.430 --> 05:43:59.440 align:start position:0%
report i will provide directly to
 
05:44:01.670 --> 05:44:01.680 align:start position:0%
superintendents we also provide a
 
05:44:04.390 --> 05:44:04.400 align:start position:0%
customized data analysis for the needed
 
05:44:06.150 --> 05:44:06.160 align:start position:0%
area as well
 
05:44:09.350 --> 05:44:09.360 align:start position:0%
so in a follow-up if i as a interested
 
05:44:11.590 --> 05:44:11.600 align:start position:0%
community member
 
05:44:13.510 --> 05:44:13.520 align:start position:0%
have not been informed
 
05:44:15.670 --> 05:44:15.680 align:start position:0%
and unaware of the results of these
 
05:44:15.680 --> 05:44:17.190 align:start position:0%
and unaware of the results of these
surveys

05:44:17.190 --> 05:44:17.200 align:start position:0%
surveys
 
05:44:19.910 --> 05:44:19.920 align:start position:0%
then how can i then ask for information
 
05:44:22.628 --> 05:44:22.638 align:start position:0%
if i you know regarding specific areas
 
05:44:25.030 --> 05:44:25.040 align:start position:0%
within that survey if i
 
05:44:27.830 --> 05:44:27.840 align:start position:0%
i i don't know and or seen
 
05:44:29.830 --> 05:44:29.840 align:start position:0%
the the results the survey it seems to
 
05:44:32.230 --> 05:44:32.240 align:start position:0%
me that if we're going to have a
 
05:44:34.948 --> 05:44:34.958 align:start position:0%
community involved
 
05:44:37.350 --> 05:44:37.360 align:start position:0%
that we need to involve the community
 
05:44:39.270 --> 05:44:39.280 align:start position:0%
and make people aware
 
05:44:42.390 --> 05:44:42.400 align:start position:0%
that there may be this a particular
 
05:44:45.190 --> 05:44:45.200 align:start position:0%
element or issue within our community
 
05:44:49.190 --> 05:44:49.200 align:start position:0%
and so um i i feel that we do this every
 
05:44:49.200 --> 05:44:51.030 align:start position:0%
and so um i i feel that we do this every
year

05:44:51.030 --> 05:44:51.040 align:start position:0%
year
 
05:44:53.430 --> 05:44:53.440 align:start position:0%
and yet are we making progress i don't
 
05:44:53.440 --> 05:44:54.470 align:start position:0%
and yet are we making progress i don't
know

05:44:54.470 --> 05:44:54.480 align:start position:0%
know
 
05:44:55.750 --> 05:44:55.760 align:start position:0%
i don't know because i've never seen the
 
05:44:57.350 --> 05:44:57.360 align:start position:0%
data for my community
 
05:45:00.310 --> 05:45:00.320 align:start position:0%
so is that available for example if if i
 
05:45:01.750 --> 05:45:01.760 align:start position:0%
as chair
 
05:45:03.510 --> 05:45:03.520 align:start position:0%
of this committee say okay i'd like to
 
05:45:05.270 --> 05:45:05.280 align:start position:0%
have the results for every community in
 
05:45:08.868 --> 05:45:08.878 align:start position:0%
this state submitted to this this body
 
05:45:10.868 --> 05:45:10.878 align:start position:0%
would that be available to us
 
05:45:13.190 --> 05:45:13.200 align:start position:0%
if you um well
 
05:45:14.948 --> 05:45:14.958 align:start position:0%
first uh first i would like to answer
 
05:45:17.190 --> 05:45:17.200 align:start position:0%
the first question is our internal
 
05:45:19.270 --> 05:45:19.280 align:start position:0%
programs in the department as well as
 
05:45:22.390 --> 05:45:22.400 align:start position:0%
the international partners they use our
 
05:45:25.190 --> 05:45:25.200 align:start position:0%
report the statewide report as well as
 
05:45:29.670 --> 05:45:29.680 align:start position:0%
public health reaching report that we
 
05:45:31.910 --> 05:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
provided to the public health reaching
 
05:45:34.948 --> 05:45:34.958 align:start position:0%
areas those reports awaited simple the
 
05:45:37.430 --> 05:45:37.440 align:start position:0%
result so it doesn't have the specific
 
05:45:37.440 --> 05:45:38.310 align:start position:0%
result so it doesn't have the specific
school

05:45:38.310 --> 05:45:38.320 align:start position:0%
school
 
05:45:41.510 --> 05:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
information and for public health region
 
05:45:43.670 --> 05:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
network they are able to utilize the
 
05:45:46.390 --> 05:45:46.400 align:start position:0%
report and then go to their own region
 
05:45:49.030 --> 05:45:49.040 align:start position:0%
to do some prevention work and the
 
05:45:52.470 --> 05:45:52.480 align:start position:0%
prevention work or the protection work
 
05:45:54.390 --> 05:45:54.400 align:start position:0%
this is another
 
05:45:57.110 --> 05:45:57.120 align:start position:0%
part of the public health business which
 
05:46:00.470 --> 05:46:00.480 align:start position:0%
i personally do not involve that much
 
05:46:02.788 --> 05:46:02.798 align:start position:0%
but back to your question chairman if
 
05:46:06.628 --> 05:46:06.638 align:start position:0%
you're requesting the report for the um
 
05:46:09.270 --> 05:46:09.280 align:start position:0%
all the community level data then the
 
05:46:11.110 --> 05:46:11.120 align:start position:0%
first thing that i will need to do is to
 
05:46:13.430 --> 05:46:13.440 align:start position:0%
contact all the superintendents to get
 
05:46:15.830 --> 05:46:15.840 align:start position:0%
their consent in order to release the
 
05:46:20.788 --> 05:46:20.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:23.190 --> 05:46:23.200 align:start position:0%
however are we talking excuse me are we
 
05:46:25.510 --> 05:46:25.520 align:start position:0%
talking aggregate data for that if you
 
05:46:27.750 --> 05:46:27.760 align:start position:0%
have a district let's say of
 
05:46:29.750 --> 05:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
a thousand kids
 
05:46:31.350 --> 05:46:31.360 align:start position:0%
so it's not going to be pointing to a
 
05:46:33.830 --> 05:46:33.840 align:start position:0%
specific child it's not a small district
 
05:46:36.548 --> 05:46:36.558 align:start position:0%
with maybe 60 or 70 kids in it yes that
 
05:46:37.990 --> 05:46:38.000 align:start position:0%
is under
 
05:46:41.030 --> 05:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
in within one district so generally one
 
05:46:44.548 --> 05:46:44.558 align:start position:0%
district may have only one high school
 
05:46:47.110 --> 05:46:47.120 align:start position:0%
and with that information for school
 
05:46:49.430 --> 05:46:49.440 align:start position:0%
level or community level it's not
 
05:46:52.230 --> 05:46:52.240 align:start position:0%
weighted so we are not able to say this
 
05:46:54.788 --> 05:46:54.798 align:start position:0%
school is performing better or worse
 
05:46:57.110 --> 05:46:57.120 align:start position:0%
than the state we will say that the
 
05:47:00.310 --> 05:47:00.320 align:start position:0%
number is higher or lower than state for
 
05:47:03.110 --> 05:47:03.120 align:start position:0%
the request that i get your example we
 
05:47:05.910 --> 05:47:05.920 align:start position:0%
will provide the aggregate result
 
05:47:08.708 --> 05:47:08.718 align:start position:0%
in the public health region or close to
 
05:47:11.110 --> 05:47:11.120 align:start position:0%
public health region that can provide
 
05:47:14.150 --> 05:47:14.160 align:start position:0%
significance in the state are in in the
 
05:47:17.670 --> 05:47:17.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:18.868 --> 05:47:18.878 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:47:19.990 --> 05:47:20.000 align:start position:0%
representative cordelia and then
 
05:47:21.430 --> 05:47:21.440 align:start position:0%
representative cornell
 
05:47:23.190 --> 05:47:23.200 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman uh thank you
 
05:47:26.628 --> 05:47:26.638 align:start position:0%
for taking another question um
 
05:47:29.590 --> 05:47:29.600 align:start position:0%
i am uh very curious about um the fact
 
05:47:32.868 --> 05:47:32.878 align:start position:0%
that um it's up to the superintendent as
 
05:47:35.990 --> 05:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
to the release of the community um
 
05:47:38.470 --> 05:47:38.480 align:start position:0%
information um
 
05:47:41.190 --> 05:47:41.200 align:start position:0%
i take it that that is a
 
05:47:44.230 --> 05:47:44.240 align:start position:0%
policy of the department of uh health
 
05:47:47.030 --> 05:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
and human services and i was wondering
 
05:47:49.430 --> 05:47:49.440 align:start position:0%
since it's not in statute is is that a
 
05:47:49.440 --> 05:47:50.470 align:start position:0%
since it's not in statute is is that a
rule

05:47:50.470 --> 05:47:50.480 align:start position:0%
rule
 
05:47:53.430 --> 05:47:53.440 align:start position:0%
that um has been put forward by
 
05:47:56.628 --> 05:47:56.638 align:start position:0%
by the uh by the department
 
05:48:00.390 --> 05:48:00.400 align:start position:0%
there is no written policy or rule
 
05:48:03.030 --> 05:48:03.040 align:start position:0%
in such a way that the community level
 
05:48:05.910 --> 05:48:05.920 align:start position:0%
report only relates to superintendents
 
05:48:08.470 --> 05:48:08.480 align:start position:0%
this is an agreement that when we
 
05:48:11.910 --> 05:48:11.920 align:start position:0%
encourage your recruiter schools
 
05:48:15.030 --> 05:48:15.040 align:start position:0%
a promise that we do not release you the
 
05:48:17.830 --> 05:48:17.840 align:start position:0%
school data or community data
 
05:48:20.070 --> 05:48:20.080 align:start position:0%
uh to other people unless
 
05:48:22.150 --> 05:48:22.160 align:start position:0%
superintendents agree
 
05:48:24.788 --> 05:48:24.798 align:start position:0%
to read this data to another party so
 
05:48:27.110 --> 05:48:27.120 align:start position:0%
it's kind of like the agreement that we
 
05:48:29.510 --> 05:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
have oral agreement if i may say
 
05:48:31.990 --> 05:48:32.000 align:start position:0%
with the superintendents when we
 
05:48:33.670 --> 05:48:33.680 align:start position:0%
encourage or recruit the schools to
 
05:48:36.230 --> 05:48:36.240 align:start position:0%
participate this the survey
 
05:48:38.150 --> 05:48:38.160 align:start position:0%
i would just think as a school board
 
05:48:41.430 --> 05:48:41.440 align:start position:0%
member i'd be upset if the uh not
 
05:48:43.270 --> 05:48:43.280 align:start position:0%
knowing that the data was available and
 
05:48:45.190 --> 05:48:45.200 align:start position:0%
the superintendent wasn't
 
05:48:47.430 --> 05:48:47.440 align:start position:0%
providing that information to us same
 
05:48:49.990 --> 05:48:50.000 align:start position:0%
way with maybe an alderman in manchester
 
05:48:51.110 --> 05:48:51.120 align:start position:0%
i'd be very
 
05:48:52.628 --> 05:48:52.638 align:start position:0%
concerned if it was up to the
 
05:48:54.948 --> 05:48:54.958 align:start position:0%
superintendent whether i saw that data
 
05:48:58.470 --> 05:48:58.480 align:start position:0%
or not yes so we give schools
 
05:48:59.830 --> 05:48:59.840 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:49:03.270 --> 05:49:03.280 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to perform the survey we
 
05:49:05.190 --> 05:49:05.200 align:start position:0%
also give school
 
05:49:08.230 --> 05:49:08.240 align:start position:0%
superintendent specifically that the
 
05:49:08.240 --> 05:49:09.830 align:start position:0%
superintendent specifically that the
authority

05:49:09.830 --> 05:49:09.840 align:start position:0%
authority
 
05:49:12.470 --> 05:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
if that's the correct word whether the
 
05:49:14.788 --> 05:49:14.798 align:start position:0%
school should release data to the school
 
05:49:17.430 --> 05:49:17.440 align:start position:0%
board or not i believe school board can
 
05:49:17.440 --> 05:49:18.788 align:start position:0%
board or not i believe school board can
request

05:49:18.788 --> 05:49:18.798 align:start position:0%
request
 
05:49:20.788 --> 05:49:20.798 align:start position:0%
this the survey result from
 
05:49:20.798 --> 05:49:24.230 align:start position:0%
this the survey result from
superintendents

05:49:24.230 --> 05:49:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:25.830 --> 05:49:25.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:49:27.670 --> 05:49:27.680 align:start position:0%
representative cornell thank you and
 
05:49:29.510 --> 05:49:29.520 align:start position:0%
this is just information but the
 
05:49:32.070 --> 05:49:32.080 align:start position:0%
department of education has all of this
 
05:49:34.708 --> 05:49:34.718 align:start position:0%
information on their website the
 
05:49:37.830 --> 05:49:37.840 align:start position:0%
the survey the the results the survey
 
05:49:41.110 --> 05:49:41.120 align:start position:0%
questionnaire the 10-year trend analysis
 
05:49:42.868 --> 05:49:42.878 align:start position:0%
demographic data
 
05:49:45.670 --> 05:49:45.680 align:start position:0%
results with graphs
 
05:49:47.910 --> 05:49:47.920 align:start position:0%
all that is on the department of
 
05:49:51.110 --> 05:49:51.120 align:start position:0%
education website so
 
05:49:54.470 --> 05:49:54.480 align:start position:0%
it's it's there for anyone to to find
 
05:49:57.110 --> 05:49:57.120 align:start position:0%
okay and follow up to that information a
 
05:49:59.590 --> 05:49:59.600 align:start position:0%
question is that available
 
05:50:01.750 --> 05:50:01.760 align:start position:0%
on a community basis that's what we're
 
05:50:03.350 --> 05:50:03.360 align:start position:0%
driving in i'm not i don't want to
 
05:50:05.670 --> 05:50:05.680 align:start position:0%
aggregate for our state i don't want the
 
05:50:08.310 --> 05:50:08.320 align:start position:0%
aggregate for the country i'm interested
 
05:50:10.150 --> 05:50:10.160 align:start position:0%
in knowing what the aggregate is for a
 
05:50:12.788 --> 05:50:12.798 align:start position:0%
particular region or school district
 
05:50:15.110 --> 05:50:15.120 align:start position:0%
fourth particular school district know
 
05:50:18.310 --> 05:50:18.320 align:start position:0%
that data is not available publicly
 
05:50:21.510 --> 05:50:21.520 align:start position:0%
for community if the community level is
 
05:50:23.350 --> 05:50:23.360 align:start position:0%
public health region
 
05:50:24.628 --> 05:50:24.638 align:start position:0%
which has
 
05:50:28.230 --> 05:50:28.240 align:start position:0%
14 regions in new hampshire that data is
 
05:50:30.390 --> 05:50:30.400 align:start position:0%
available online
 
05:50:32.708 --> 05:50:32.718 align:start position:0%
i'd like to just follow up with it's not
 
05:50:34.868 --> 05:50:34.878 align:start position:0%
available publicly
 
05:50:36.788 --> 05:50:36.798 align:start position:0%
is it available
 
05:50:39.990 --> 05:50:40.000 align:start position:0%
it is available for community level data
 
05:50:44.548 --> 05:50:44.558 align:start position:0%
or school district level level data yes
 
05:50:47.030 --> 05:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
it is available per request and we do
 
05:50:49.430 --> 05:50:49.440 align:start position:0%
have the data request process in order
 
05:50:49.440 --> 05:50:50.150 align:start position:0%
have the data request process in order
to

our
 
05:51:01.990 --> 05:51:02.000 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chair uh just as a as a
 
05:51:09.510 --> 05:51:09.520 align:start position:0%
point because teachable moment uh i also
 
05:51:11.750 --> 05:51:11.760 align:start position:0%
looked up but i looked up on the hhs
 
05:51:14.230 --> 05:51:14.240 align:start position:0%
website where the same information is
 
05:51:16.948 --> 05:51:16.958 align:start position:0%
available as available on the
 
05:51:18.948 --> 05:51:18.958 align:start position:0%
department of education site and i
 
05:51:21.510 --> 05:51:21.520 align:start position:0%

sullivan county the county i represent
 
05:51:26.070 --> 05:51:26.080 align:start position:0%
which had all the information they also
 
05:51:28.150 --> 05:51:28.160 align:start position:0%
have a north north country which i
 
05:51:30.230 --> 05:51:30.240 align:start position:0%
assume is your area
 
05:51:32.310 --> 05:51:32.320 align:start position:0%
or goes into your area that's all
 
05:51:34.628 --> 05:51:34.638 align:start position:0%
available on um health and human
 
05:51:38.070 --> 05:51:38.080 align:start position:0%

further questions representative porter
 
05:51:47.910 --> 05:51:47.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
05:51:49.430 --> 05:51:49.440 align:start position:0%
i'll try to make this brief is the
 
05:51:51.110 --> 05:51:51.120 align:start position:0%
reason why
 
05:51:53.548 --> 05:51:53.558 align:start position:0%
the spec
 
05:51:56.868 --> 05:51:56.878 align:start position:0%
non-publicly available information
 
05:51:58.628 --> 05:51:58.638 align:start position:0%
is non-public
 
05:52:00.948 --> 05:52:00.958 align:start position:0%
to protect the privacy
 
05:52:01.990 --> 05:52:02.000 align:start position:0%
of the
 
05:52:03.190 --> 05:52:03.200 align:start position:0%
people who
 
05:52:05.830 --> 05:52:05.840 align:start position:0%
part took of the survey or is there
 
05:52:07.350 --> 05:52:07.360 align:start position:0%
another reason
 
05:52:10.868 --> 05:52:10.878 align:start position:0%
the main reason is yes to protect the
 
05:52:10.878 --> 05:52:12.230 align:start position:0%
the main reason is yes to protect the
privacy

05:52:12.230 --> 05:52:12.240 align:start position:0%
privacy
 
05:52:14.708 --> 05:52:14.718 align:start position:0%
for the individual school district
 
05:52:18.868 --> 05:52:18.878 align:start position:0%
another reason is we do not want to
 
05:52:21.910 --> 05:52:21.920 align:start position:0%
mislead the information or misguided
 
05:52:24.390 --> 05:52:24.400 align:start position:0%
information how does school report or
 
05:52:26.470 --> 05:52:26.480 align:start position:0%
community school community reports
 
05:52:27.910 --> 05:52:27.920 align:start position:0%
should be used
 
05:52:30.708 --> 05:52:30.718 align:start position:0%
only if parents may say that
 
05:52:31.990 --> 05:52:32.000 align:start position:0%
school a
 
05:52:35.350 --> 05:52:35.360 align:start position:0%
is better than school b we try not to
 
05:52:37.430 --> 05:52:37.440 align:start position:0%
create this kind of confusion among the
 
05:52:37.440 --> 05:52:44.548 align:start position:0%
create this kind of confusion among the
community

05:52:44.548 --> 05:52:44.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:46.470 --> 05:52:46.480 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chair
 
05:52:50.788 --> 05:52:50.798 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question do they
 
05:52:52.788 --> 05:52:52.798 align:start position:0%
ever ask students
 
05:52:54.310 --> 05:52:54.320 align:start position:0%
say when they're going out of high
 
05:52:56.548 --> 05:52:56.558 align:start position:0%
school if they were honest
 
05:52:58.310 --> 05:52:58.320 align:start position:0%
when they gave the answer say in the
 
05:53:00.070 --> 05:53:00.080 align:start position:0%
sixth grade is there a follow-up where
 
05:53:01.430 --> 05:53:01.440 align:start position:0%
they you know in high school they would
 
05:53:02.948 --> 05:53:02.958 align:start position:0%
probably be more honest to tell you yeah
 
05:53:04.868 --> 05:53:04.878 align:start position:0%
i was clowning around in the middle
 
05:53:06.628 --> 05:53:06.638 align:start position:0%
school or something is there ever a
 
05:53:08.788 --> 05:53:08.798 align:start position:0%
follow-up and that type of thing
 
05:53:12.470 --> 05:53:12.480 align:start position:0%
we do not follow up with students
 
05:53:15.510 --> 05:53:15.520 align:start position:0%
or the schools on how they do the survey
 
05:53:17.910 --> 05:53:17.920 align:start position:0%

do they go to the department of

education for review and selection of
 
05:55:10.390 --> 05:55:10.400 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for the question so
 
05:55:11.750 --> 05:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
05:55:15.830 --> 05:55:15.840 align:start position:0%
ylbs is a journey effort between dhhs
 
05:55:18.708 --> 05:55:18.718 align:start position:0%
and department of education so every
 
05:55:21.430 --> 05:55:21.440 align:start position:0%
time uh first of all ybs is every other
 
05:55:24.390 --> 05:55:24.400 align:start position:0%
year so we survey on the odd year so
 
05:55:27.510 --> 05:55:27.520 align:start position:0%
last time we survey is in 2021 next time
 
05:55:31.030 --> 05:55:31.040 align:start position:0%
the survey will be performed as in 2023
 
05:55:33.430 --> 05:55:33.440 align:start position:0%
so every time when we prepare the
 
05:55:36.230 --> 05:55:36.240 align:start position:0%
questionnaires based on we will receive
 
05:55:38.470 --> 05:55:38.480 align:start position:0%
the standard questions from question
 
05:55:41.990 --> 05:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
sets from cdc those are the suggested
 
05:55:44.628 --> 05:55:44.638 align:start position:0%
questions for those questions
 
05:55:48.390 --> 05:55:48.400 align:start position:0%
we try to keep the questions that are
 
05:55:50.150 --> 05:55:50.160 align:start position:0%
the same
 
05:55:52.948 --> 05:55:52.958 align:start position:0%
each survey year so that we can do
 
05:55:55.030 --> 05:55:55.040 align:start position:0%
we can have better understanding on the
 
05:55:57.990 --> 05:55:58.000 align:start position:0%
time trend whether the behavior
 
05:56:00.548 --> 05:56:00.558 align:start position:0%
is going up or going down or keep it the
 
05:56:00.558 --> 05:56:01.510 align:start position:0%
is going up or going down or keep it the
same

05:56:01.510 --> 05:56:01.520 align:start position:0%
same
 
05:56:03.830 --> 05:56:03.840 align:start position:0%
and then for the questions or selection
 
05:56:03.840 --> 05:56:05.030 align:start position:0%
and then for the questions or selection
process

05:56:05.030 --> 05:56:05.040 align:start position:0%
process
 
05:56:08.948 --> 05:56:08.958 align:start position:0%
we will take the cdc um questions as a
 
05:56:10.390 --> 05:56:10.400 align:start position:0%
question based
 
05:56:13.270 --> 05:56:13.280 align:start position:0%
and then consulted with each program
 
05:56:15.750 --> 05:56:15.760 align:start position:0%
areas within public health with within
 
05:56:19.430 --> 05:56:19.440 align:start position:0%
dhhs as well as with the department of
 
05:56:19.440 --> 05:56:20.548 align:start position:0%
dhhs as well as with the department of
education

education
 
05:56:22.548 --> 05:56:22.558 align:start position:0%
and i think there was a question about
 
05:56:25.030 --> 05:56:25.040 align:start position:0%
how questions are selected we also
 
05:56:25.040 --> 05:56:27.910 align:start position:0%
how questions are selected we also
received

05:56:27.910 --> 05:56:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:30.708 --> 05:56:30.718 align:start position:0%
letters of support from the communities
 
05:56:34.070 --> 05:56:34.080 align:start position:0%
to advocate a type of question or topic
 
05:56:35.830 --> 05:56:35.840 align:start position:0%
to be included
 
05:56:39.350 --> 05:56:39.360 align:start position:0%
in the yrbs and for that kind of
 
05:56:41.830 --> 05:56:41.840 align:start position:0%
advocate questions we also take into
 
05:56:45.110 --> 05:56:45.120 align:start position:0%
account uh in the question selection so
 
05:56:47.750 --> 05:56:47.760 align:start position:0%
for doe department of education they
 
05:56:50.150 --> 05:56:50.160 align:start position:0%
will have the final review of all the
 
05:56:52.708 --> 05:56:52.718 align:start position:0%

note worksheet we completed was not
 
05:57:21.830 --> 05:57:21.840 align:start position:0%
attached to the bill and i was told that
 
05:57:24.628 --> 05:57:24.638 align:start position:0%
the fn was removed um but we wanted to
 
05:57:26.230 --> 05:57:26.240 align:start position:0%

05:57:28.230 --> 05:57:28.240 align:start position:0%
of the fiscal analysis of the bill that
 
05:57:29.910 --> 05:57:29.920 align:start position:0%
we would
 
05:57:32.548 --> 05:57:32.558 align:start position:0%
need a data analyst position if the
 
05:57:35.190 --> 05:57:35.200 align:start position:0%
survey were to become opt-in because of
 
05:57:37.670 --> 05:57:37.680 align:start position:0%
the needed data we would have to do some
 
05:57:39.590 --> 05:57:39.600 align:start position:0%
uh some some additional work around data
 
05:57:40.628 --> 05:57:40.638 align:start position:0%
and also
 
05:57:42.868 --> 05:57:42.878 align:start position:0%
that position would be
 
05:57:44.788 --> 05:57:44.798 align:start position:0%
someone that would communicate and help
 
05:57:46.150 --> 05:57:46.160 align:start position:0%
districts with
 
05:57:49.110 --> 05:57:49.120 align:start position:0%
um questions related to the survey uh as
 
05:57:51.190 --> 05:57:51.200 align:start position:0%
it would be an opt-in as opposed to an
 
05:57:53.270 --> 05:57:53.280 align:start position:0%
an opt-out so there would be a one
 
05:57:55.030 --> 05:57:55.040 align:start position:0%
full-time fte position that we would
 
05:57:56.310 --> 05:57:56.320 align:start position:0%
need for that and i just wanted to share
 
05:57:58.070 --> 05:57:58.080 align:start position:0%
that with the community uh did you do
 
05:58:00.070 --> 05:58:00.080 align:start position:0%
any kind of a estimate as far as what
 
05:58:01.590 --> 05:58:01.600 align:start position:0%
that would cost for that analysis a
 
05:58:03.110 --> 05:58:03.120 align:start position:0%
hundred fifteen thousand dollars a year
 
05:58:04.230 --> 05:58:04.240 align:start position:0%
i think it was about a hundred and
 
05:58:06.230 --> 05:58:06.240 align:start position:0%
twelve thousand hundred and twelve yes i
 
05:58:08.150 --> 05:58:08.160 align:start position:0%

mental illness and suicide in the
 
05:58:55.990 --> 05:58:56.000 align:start position:0%
interest of time you've heard a lot of

testimony with a lot of people previous
 
05:59:00.948 --> 05:59:00.958 align:start position:0%
speakers much more knowledgeable than
 
05:59:02.868 --> 05:59:02.878 align:start position:0%
than i am i would just say specifically
 
05:59:05.030 --> 05:59:05.040 align:start position:0%
for suicide and mental health that nami
 
05:59:08.470 --> 05:59:08.480 align:start position:0%
new hampshire does use yrbs data
 
05:59:10.628 --> 05:59:10.638 align:start position:0%
to identify
 
05:59:12.948 --> 05:59:12.958 align:start position:0%
or hear from school districts sometimes
 
05:59:15.910 --> 05:59:15.920 align:start position:0%
where yrbs data results are of concern
 
05:59:17.350 --> 05:59:17.360 align:start position:0%
to them and they're looking to us to
 
05:59:18.390 --> 05:59:18.400 align:start position:0%
help them
 
05:59:20.390 --> 05:59:20.400 align:start position:0%
provide suicide prevention and training
 
05:59:23.910 --> 05:59:23.920 align:start position:0%
we also use it for grant purposes and
 
05:59:25.910 --> 05:59:25.920 align:start position:0%
it's very useful
 
05:59:28.548 --> 05:59:28.558 align:start position:0%
we received a five-year
 
05:59:30.470 --> 05:59:30.480 align:start position:0%
we're designated by the state to apply
 
05:59:32.470 --> 05:59:32.480 align:start position:0%
for a five-year suicide use suicide
 
05:59:34.868 --> 05:59:34.878 align:start position:0%
prevention grant and those
 
05:59:37.030 --> 05:59:37.040 align:start position:0%
federal grants often
 
05:59:39.430 --> 05:59:39.440 align:start position:0%
are looking to wire bs data from by
 
05:59:41.590 --> 05:59:41.600 align:start position:0%
comparison to other states in order to
 
05:59:43.830 --> 05:59:43.840 align:start position:0%
to identify and ensure that funds go to
 
05:59:45.590 --> 05:59:45.600 align:start position:0%
states where the highest risk has been
 
05:59:45.600 --> 05:59:47.110 align:start position:0%
states where the highest risk has been
identified

05:59:47.110 --> 05:59:47.120 align:start position:0%
identified
 
05:59:51.190 --> 05:59:51.200 align:start position:0%
and we also oppose the the um
 
05:59:53.750 --> 05:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
the the opt in measure for reasons that
 
05:59:56.230 --> 05:59:56.240 align:start position:0%
have been previously stated
 
05:59:58.310 --> 05:59:58.320 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions thank you
 
06:00:03.270 --> 06:00:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:05.990 --> 06:00:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:07.510 --> 06:00:07.520 align:start position:0%
this we might first of all thank you for
 
06:00:08.868 --> 06:00:08.878 align:start position:0%
taking the question and we might have
 
06:00:11.430 --> 06:00:11.440 align:start position:0%
already covered this but uh i just i
 
06:00:12.708 --> 06:00:12.718 align:start position:0%
wanted to be sure
 
06:00:12.718 --> 06:00:13.510 align:start position:0%
wanted to be sure
so

06:00:13.510 --> 06:00:13.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:00:16.150 --> 06:00:16.160 align:start position:0%
the survey is redone every two years the
 
06:00:18.470 --> 06:00:18.480 align:start position:0%
same group of students how often do they
 
06:00:21.190 --> 06:00:21.200 align:start position:0%
take it are they taking it annually or
 
06:00:22.868 --> 06:00:22.878 align:start position:0%
every two years or once in their high
 
06:00:24.070 --> 06:00:24.080 align:start position:0%
school career
 
06:00:26.070 --> 06:00:26.080 align:start position:0%
i believe it's every two years they take
 
06:00:26.080 --> 06:00:26.708 align:start position:0%
i believe it's every two years they take
it

06:00:26.708 --> 06:00:26.718 align:start position:0%
it
 
06:00:29.270 --> 06:00:29.280 align:start position:0%
so are we oh let me ask a follow-up go
 
06:00:29.280 --> 06:00:29.990 align:start position:0%
so are we oh let me ask a follow-up go
ahead

06:00:29.990 --> 06:00:30.000 align:start position:0%
ahead
 
06:00:33.990 --> 06:00:34.000 align:start position:0%
are we measuring are we able to measure
 
06:00:36.070 --> 06:00:36.080 align:start position:0%
how effective this survey is because i'm
 
06:00:37.670 --> 06:00:37.680 align:start position:0%
hearing that the survey is valuable
 
06:00:39.430 --> 06:00:39.440 align:start position:0%
because we're able to get resources out
 
06:00:41.190 --> 06:00:41.200 align:start position:0%
there to these students so i'm just
 
06:00:43.590 --> 06:00:43.600 align:start position:0%
wondering are we comparing let's say the
 
06:00:46.070 --> 06:00:46.080 align:start position:0%
freshman class their survey results to
 
06:00:48.548 --> 06:00:48.558 align:start position:0%
when they become juniors and have things
 
06:00:48.558 --> 06:00:49.830 align:start position:0%
when they become juniors and have things
improved

06:00:49.830 --> 06:00:49.840 align:start position:0%
improved
 
06:00:52.310 --> 06:00:52.320 align:start position:0%
i would defer to the public health folks
 
06:00:54.390 --> 06:00:54.400 align:start position:0%
to answer that question but yes i think
 
06:00:57.350 --> 06:00:57.360 align:start position:0%
some of what is available are trends and
 
06:00:57.360 --> 06:00:59.590 align:start position:0%
some of what is available are trends and
comparisons

06:00:59.590 --> 06:00:59.600 align:start position:0%
comparisons
 
06:01:01.110 --> 06:01:01.120 align:start position:0%
relative to the data that's been
 
06:01:01.120 --> 06:01:02.948 align:start position:0%
relative to the data that's been
identified

06:01:02.948 --> 06:01:02.958 align:start position:0%
identified
 
06:01:05.750 --> 06:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
so there's solid metrics we can look at
 
06:01:05.760 --> 06:01:09.430 align:start position:0%
so there's solid metrics we can look at
yes

06:01:09.430 --> 06:01:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:12.070 --> 06:01:12.080 align:start position:0%

06:03:25.670 --> 06:03:25.680 align:start position:0%
four thousand youth
 
06:03:27.510 --> 06:03:27.520 align:start position:0%
those efforts would be significantly
 
06:03:29.830 --> 06:03:29.840 align:start position:0%
hampered without the accurate data to
 
06:03:31.990 --> 06:03:32.000 align:start position:0%
reflect the realities of the experience
 
06:03:34.390 --> 06:03:34.400 align:start position:0%
of young greatest granite staters in the

06:03:35.990 --> 06:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
community
 
06:03:37.430 --> 06:03:37.440 align:start position:0%
over the last three years the crisis
 
06:03:39.590 --> 06:03:39.600 align:start position:0%
center advocates have helped more than 4
 
06:03:41.670 --> 06:03:41.680 align:start position:0%
500 children and youth victims of
 
06:03:44.230 --> 06:03:44.240 align:start position:0%
domestic and sexual violence
 
06:03:46.708 --> 06:03:46.718 align:start position:0%
a major component of developing
 
06:03:48.868 --> 06:03:48.878 align:start position:0%
successful and effective evidence-based
 
06:03:51.910 --> 06:03:51.920 align:start position:0%
interventions is utilizing the data and
 
06:03:54.230 --> 06:03:54.240 align:start position:0%
information obtained through the youth
 
06:03:56.788 --> 06:03:56.798 align:start position:0%
risk behavior survey which directly
 
06:03:58.708 --> 06:03:58.718 align:start position:0%
informs the prevention programming at
 
06:04:01.430 --> 06:04:01.440 align:start position:0%
schools coordinated by your local crisis
 
06:04:01.440 --> 06:04:02.788 align:start position:0%
schools coordinated by your local crisis
centers

06:04:02.788 --> 06:04:02.798 align:start position:0%
centers
 
06:04:05.750 --> 06:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
it's through these surveys and data that
 
06:04:07.750 --> 06:04:07.760 align:start position:0%
that provide
 
06:04:09.830 --> 06:04:09.840 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry it's through these surveys
 
06:04:12.070 --> 06:04:12.080 align:start position:0%
and the data that they provide that we
 
06:04:14.150 --> 06:04:14.160 align:start position:0%
can better understand the prevalence of
 
06:04:15.910 --> 06:04:15.920 align:start position:0%
sexual abuse and violence and how
 
06:04:18.310 --> 06:04:18.320 align:start position:0%
programming can be tailored to the needs
 
06:04:20.788 --> 06:04:20.798 align:start position:0%
of students in schools
 
06:04:23.430 --> 06:04:23.440 align:start position:0%
without consistent data collection we
 
06:04:25.270 --> 06:04:25.280 align:start position:0%
will be unable to gather accurate
 
06:04:27.990 --> 06:04:28.000 align:start position:0%
demographic information that is used to
 
06:04:30.470 --> 06:04:30.480 align:start position:0%
develop strategies to prevent abuse
 
06:04:33.270 --> 06:04:33.280 align:start position:0%
and harm in our communities
 
06:04:35.830 --> 06:04:35.840 align:start position:0%
this is especially imperative
 
06:04:37.830 --> 06:04:37.840 align:start position:0%
when you consider the impact that the
 
06:04:39.830 --> 06:04:39.840 align:start position:0%
pandemic has had on domestic violence
 
06:04:41.430 --> 06:04:41.440 align:start position:0%
sexual assault and child abuse and the
 
06:04:43.750 --> 06:04:43.760 align:start position:0%
ability of crisis centers to conduct
 
06:04:45.510 --> 06:04:45.520 align:start position:0%
prevention programming
 
06:04:47.830 --> 06:04:47.840 align:start position:0%
crisis center advocates continue to
 
06:04:50.230 --> 06:04:50.240 align:start position:0%
report increased outreach from school
 
06:04:53.350 --> 06:04:53.360 align:start position:0%
districts and administrators schools are
 
06:04:55.270 --> 06:04:55.280 align:start position:0%
witnessing a significant increase in
 
06:04:57.750 --> 06:04:57.760 align:start position:0%
bullying incidents severe mental health
 
06:04:57.760 --> 06:04:58.948 align:start position:0%
bullying incidents severe mental health
issues

06:04:58.948 --> 06:04:58.958 align:start position:0%
issues
 
06:05:01.670 --> 06:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
and title ix reports and in response to
 
06:05:03.670 --> 06:05:03.680 align:start position:0%
that the schools have requested more
 
06:05:05.430 --> 06:05:05.440 align:start position:0%
support from their local crisis centers
 
06:05:06.708 --> 06:05:06.718 align:start position:0%
to help
 
06:05:06.718 --> 06:05:09.190 align:start position:0%
to help
intervene

06:05:09.190 --> 06:05:09.200 align:start position:0%
intervene
 
06:05:12.070 --> 06:05:12.080 align:start position:0%
yeah so just in conclusion before we
 
06:05:14.310 --> 06:05:14.320 align:start position:0%
begin to consider scaling back our
 
06:05:16.548 --> 06:05:16.558 align:start position:0%
efforts to administrate this survey
 
06:05:18.948 --> 06:05:18.958 align:start position:0%
we really ask that we consider the full
 
06:05:20.628 --> 06:05:20.638 align:start position:0%
impact that changes to the data
 
06:05:23.030 --> 06:05:23.040 align:start position:0%
collected could have on this important
 
06:05:24.628 --> 06:05:24.638 align:start position:0%
and critical work that we do to try to
 
06:05:26.628 --> 06:05:26.638 align:start position:0%
prevent child abuse and support our
 
06:05:28.310 --> 06:05:28.320 align:start position:0%
schools in responding
 
06:05:30.868 --> 06:05:30.878 align:start position:0%
to these incidences and so thank you so
 
06:05:32.310 --> 06:05:32.320 align:start position:0%
much and we'd be happy to answer any
 
06:05:32.320 --> 06:05:33.990 align:start position:0%
much and we'd be happy to answer any
questions

06:05:33.990 --> 06:05:34.000 align:start position:0%
questions
 
06:05:36.470 --> 06:05:36.480 align:start position:0%
representative hopps
 
06:05:38.150 --> 06:05:38.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
06:05:40.708 --> 06:05:40.718 align:start position:0%
your testimony today i was wondering if
 
06:05:43.030 --> 06:05:43.040 align:start position:0%
you could explain to me
 
06:05:46.390 --> 06:05:46.400 align:start position:0%
how you decide what communities to help
 
06:05:48.628 --> 06:05:48.638 align:start position:0%
what is the metric you use
 
06:05:50.470 --> 06:05:50.480 align:start position:0%
and what is the process
 
06:05:53.270 --> 06:05:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:54.788 --> 06:05:54.798 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
06:05:57.750 --> 06:05:57.760 align:start position:0%
um so essentially it's
 
06:06:00.708 --> 06:06:00.718 align:start position:0%
it's not necessarily determining
 
06:06:02.868 --> 06:06:02.878 align:start position:0%
who we should be providing support to
 
06:06:04.310 --> 06:06:04.320 align:start position:0%
it's determining what kind of
 
06:06:06.628 --> 06:06:06.638 align:start position:0%
programming we should be bringing into
 
06:06:08.628 --> 06:06:08.638 align:start position:0%
the schools depending on what kind of
 
06:06:10.230 --> 06:06:10.240 align:start position:0%
issues the
 
06:06:13.190 --> 06:06:13.200 align:start position:0%
students are experiencing um obviously
 
06:06:15.430 --> 06:06:15.440 align:start position:0%
it's it's also an opt-in for the schools
 
06:06:16.948 --> 06:06:16.958 align:start position:0%
to be bringing in their prevent the
 
06:06:18.628 --> 06:06:18.638 align:start position:0%
prevention coordinators from the crisis
 
06:06:22.548 --> 06:06:22.558 align:start position:0%
centers but the programming that they
 
06:06:25.030 --> 06:06:25.040 align:start position:0%
develop is based off of the results of
 
06:06:27.350 --> 06:06:27.360 align:start position:0%
this data and what the demographics look
 
06:06:31.430 --> 06:06:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:33.270 --> 06:06:33.280 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli
 
06:06:35.110 --> 06:06:35.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
06:06:38.470 --> 06:06:38.480 align:start position:0%
being here and for your work
 
06:06:40.788 --> 06:06:40.798 align:start position:0%
since you develop programming for
 
06:06:40.798 --> 06:06:41.990 align:start position:0%
since you develop programming for
schools

06:06:41.990 --> 06:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
schools
 
06:06:42.000 --> 06:06:43.110 align:start position:0%
schools
um

06:06:43.110 --> 06:06:43.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:06:47.510 --> 06:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure what level yrbs data
 
06:06:49.110 --> 06:06:49.120 align:start position:0%
you are
 
06:06:49.120 --> 06:06:50.390 align:start position:0%
you are
using

06:06:50.390 --> 06:06:50.400 align:start position:0%
using
 
06:06:53.110 --> 06:06:53.120 align:start position:0%
to make those determinations
 
06:06:54.310 --> 06:06:54.320 align:start position:0%
if it is
 
06:06:58.070 --> 06:06:58.080 align:start position:0%
regional data as we've heard such as the
 
06:06:59.670 --> 06:06:59.680 align:start position:0%
north country
 
06:07:01.270 --> 06:07:01.280 align:start position:0%
that's a pretty big
 
06:07:04.868 --> 06:07:04.878 align:start position:0%
uh chunk of the state and how
 
06:07:04.878 --> 06:07:05.910 align:start position:0%
uh chunk of the state and how
with

06:07:05.910 --> 06:07:05.920 align:start position:0%
with
 
06:07:05.920 --> 06:07:06.708 align:start position:0%
with
that

06:07:06.708 --> 06:07:06.718 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:07:08.310 --> 06:07:08.320 align:start position:0%
level of data
 
06:07:10.548 --> 06:07:10.558 align:start position:0%
do you come up with
 
06:07:13.190 --> 06:07:13.200 align:start position:0%
pro school specific
 
06:07:15.190 --> 06:07:15.200 align:start position:0%
uh programs
 
06:07:17.190 --> 06:07:17.200 align:start position:0%
thank you that's a great question so um
 
06:07:19.270 --> 06:07:19.280 align:start position:0%
each of our crisis centers are based out
 
06:07:20.548 --> 06:07:20.558 align:start position:0%
of all of the different counties
 
06:07:21.910 --> 06:07:21.920 align:start position:0%
throughout the state
 
06:07:21.920 --> 06:07:22.948 align:start position:0%
throughout the state
so

06:07:22.948 --> 06:07:22.958 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:07:25.590 --> 06:07:25.600 align:start position:0%
the the data that we are able to
 
06:07:28.310 --> 06:07:28.320 align:start position:0%
have access to through the dhhs website
 
06:07:30.390 --> 06:07:30.400 align:start position:0%
the doe websites
 
06:07:32.390 --> 06:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
gives us county-wide data
 
06:07:34.470 --> 06:07:34.480 align:start position:0%
so we're able to
 
06:07:36.708 --> 06:07:36.718 align:start position:0%
glean from that information what is
 
06:07:39.750 --> 06:07:39.760 align:start position:0%
needed county-wide and so each program
 
06:07:41.510 --> 06:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
we have a couple programs that share
 
06:07:43.830 --> 06:07:43.840 align:start position:0%
counties depending on the areas
 
06:07:47.110 --> 06:07:47.120 align:start position:0%
um that they're able to use utilize that
 
06:07:50.230 --> 06:07:50.240 align:start position:0%
data for those specific counties
 
06:07:51.590 --> 06:07:51.600 align:start position:0%
which would be within their catchment
 
06:07:51.600 --> 06:07:55.270 align:start position:0%
which would be within their catchment
areas

06:07:55.270 --> 06:07:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:57.670 --> 06:07:57.680 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
06:07:59.990 --> 06:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
do you feel it be advantageous to your
 
06:08:03.350 --> 06:08:03.360 align:start position:0%
organization if you were to receive
 
06:08:03.360 --> 06:08:04.390 align:start position:0%
organization if you were to receive
data

06:08:04.390 --> 06:08:04.400 align:start position:0%
data
 
06:08:06.070 --> 06:08:06.080 align:start position:0%
regarding these counties for example i
 
06:08:08.548 --> 06:08:08.558 align:start position:0%
live in a county where
 
06:08:08.558 --> 06:08:09.750 align:start position:0%
live in a county where
grafton

06:08:09.750 --> 06:08:09.760 align:start position:0%
grafton
 
06:08:12.470 --> 06:08:12.480 align:start position:0%
where the population exists in hanover
 
06:08:15.190 --> 06:08:15.200 align:start position:0%
lebanon plymouth
 
06:08:16.868 --> 06:08:16.878 align:start position:0%
maybe if you consider littleton way up
 
06:08:19.430 --> 06:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
north but that's really not that large
 
06:08:19.440 --> 06:08:20.548 align:start position:0%
north but that's really not that large
um

06:08:20.548 --> 06:08:20.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:08:22.230 --> 06:08:22.240 align:start position:0%
so i
 
06:08:25.510 --> 06:08:25.520 align:start position:0%
my question then is would you
 
06:08:27.110 --> 06:08:27.120 align:start position:0%
do you perceive that data that you're
 
06:08:29.990 --> 06:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
getting back the same for the larger
 
06:08:32.868 --> 06:08:32.878 align:start position:0%
urban oriented places as you do the
 
06:08:35.110 --> 06:08:35.120 align:start position:0%
smaller communities
 
06:08:37.110 --> 06:08:37.120 align:start position:0%
how you know how widespread are some of
 
06:08:38.470 --> 06:08:38.480 align:start position:0%
these issues
 
06:08:41.510 --> 06:08:41.520 align:start position:0%
etc so i would say that it would be it
 
06:08:43.270 --> 06:08:43.280 align:start position:0%
would be more effective for our
 
06:08:45.910 --> 06:08:45.920 align:start position:0%
prevention educators and our member
 
06:08:49.030 --> 06:08:49.040 align:start position:0%
programs to have um
 
06:08:51.830 --> 06:08:51.840 align:start position:0%
more specific data uh broken down by
 
06:08:51.840 --> 06:08:52.868 align:start position:0%
more specific data uh broken down by
town

06:08:52.868 --> 06:08:52.878 align:start position:0%
town
 
06:08:55.350 --> 06:08:55.360 align:start position:0%
or by by specific community because it
 
06:08:57.510 --> 06:08:57.520 align:start position:0%
is a little challenging specifically for
 
06:08:59.430 --> 06:08:59.440 align:start position:0%
grafton county we have three member
 
06:09:02.628 --> 06:09:02.638 align:start position:0%
programs that serve grafton county and
 
06:09:04.548 --> 06:09:04.558 align:start position:0%
so it is really challenging because you
 
06:09:06.868 --> 06:09:06.878 align:start position:0%
have uh pockets of rural communities and
 
06:09:09.030 --> 06:09:09.040 align:start position:0%
then you have uh you know
 
06:09:11.270 --> 06:09:11.280 align:start position:0%
um communities that are a little you
 
06:09:13.110 --> 06:09:13.120 align:start position:0%
know have larger populations and so the
 
06:09:15.030 --> 06:09:15.040 align:start position:0%
needs are going to be different but
 
06:09:17.750 --> 06:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
currently we're only able to access the
 
06:09:18.788 --> 06:09:18.798 align:start position:0%
the data
 
06:09:22.548 --> 06:09:22.558 align:start position:0%

i came here today and
 
06:10:15.030 --> 06:10:15.040 align:start position:0%
i wanted to support this bill because of
 
06:10:17.350 --> 06:10:17.360 align:start position:0%
my personal experience at the high
 
06:10:17.360 --> 06:10:19.110 align:start position:0%
my personal experience at the high
school

06:10:19.110 --> 06:10:19.120 align:start position:0%
school
 
06:10:21.830 --> 06:10:21.840 align:start position:0%
when i first heard about the survey it
 
06:10:23.670 --> 06:10:23.680 align:start position:0%
was when my daughter was calling me from
 
06:10:25.990 --> 06:10:26.000 align:start position:0%
the high school so upset about what was
 
06:10:28.070 --> 06:10:28.080 align:start position:0%
being asked her
 
06:10:30.150 --> 06:10:30.160 align:start position:0%
she told me that it went through the
 
06:10:32.628 --> 06:10:32.638 align:start position:0%
school like wildfire and
 
06:10:34.390 --> 06:10:34.400 align:start position:0%
that it was all over social media and
 
06:10:35.830 --> 06:10:35.840 align:start position:0%
that everyone in the school was talking
 
06:10:37.590 --> 06:10:37.600 align:start position:0%
about how upset they were
 
06:10:38.788 --> 06:10:38.798 align:start position:0%
my son
 
06:10:41.350 --> 06:10:41.360 align:start position:0%
also took home or tried to take home the
 
06:10:43.350 --> 06:10:43.360 align:start position:0%
survey to show me because he was so
 
06:10:45.990 --> 06:10:46.000 align:start position:0%
disturbed about the questions
 
06:10:48.948 --> 06:10:48.958 align:start position:0%
our school never gave us the option um
 
06:10:51.190 --> 06:10:51.200 align:start position:0%
to opt out or let us know that they were
 
06:10:52.948 --> 06:10:52.958 align:start position:0%
going to be giving the survey to the
 
06:10:55.110 --> 06:10:55.120 align:start position:0%
students but they had been planning it
 
06:10:56.948 --> 06:10:56.958 align:start position:0%
for over a month because i spoke with
 
06:10:59.110 --> 06:10:59.120 align:start position:0%
another teacher and they redid their
 
06:11:01.190 --> 06:11:01.200 align:start position:0%
whole calendar schedule so that there
 
06:11:03.270 --> 06:11:03.280 align:start position:0%
was two teachers in each classroom
 
06:11:04.628 --> 06:11:04.638 align:start position:0%
giving the survey
 
06:11:06.230 --> 06:11:06.240 align:start position:0%
the teacher i spoke to said that she
 
06:11:07.990 --> 06:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
felt so uncomfortable with it that she
 
06:11:10.868 --> 06:11:10.878 align:start position:0%
didn't go to school that day
 
06:11:13.270 --> 06:11:13.280 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if any of you have read any
 
06:11:14.868 --> 06:11:14.878 align:start position:0%
of the questions so i've picked and
 
06:11:18.150 --> 06:11:18.160 align:start position:0%
highlighted a few that really concern me
 
06:11:19.910 --> 06:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
the reason i'm reading them to you is
 
06:11:19.920 --> 06:11:21.190 align:start position:0%
the reason i'm reading them to you is
because

06:11:21.190 --> 06:11:21.200 align:start position:0%
because
 
06:11:23.590 --> 06:11:23.600 align:start position:0%
so far all i've heard for testimony
 
06:11:25.910 --> 06:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
today is people talking about grants
 
06:11:28.788 --> 06:11:28.798 align:start position:0%
looking for money to fund programs that
 
06:11:31.270 --> 06:11:31.280 align:start position:0%
they want and i'm coming to you today to
 
06:11:33.750 --> 06:11:33.760 align:start position:0%
say this is not good for our students
 
06:11:35.350 --> 06:11:35.360 align:start position:0%
for the children
 
06:11:35.360 --> 06:11:36.548 align:start position:0%
for the children
and

06:11:36.548 --> 06:11:36.558 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:11:38.070 --> 06:11:38.080 align:start position:0%
it's leaving them with a lot of
 
06:11:39.910 --> 06:11:39.920 align:start position:0%
questions and no one to follow up with
 
06:11:39.920 --> 06:11:42.310 align:start position:0%
questions and no one to follow up with
it

06:11:42.310 --> 06:11:42.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:44.470 --> 06:11:44.480 align:start position:0%
there's a whole section that talks about
 
06:11:44.480 --> 06:11:45.750 align:start position:0%
there's a whole section that talks about
suicide

06:11:45.750 --> 06:11:45.760 align:start position:0%
suicide
 
06:11:47.910 --> 06:11:47.920 align:start position:0%
it says the next six questions ask about
 
06:11:50.470 --> 06:11:50.480 align:start position:0%
feeling sad and attempted suicide
 
06:11:52.628 --> 06:11:52.638 align:start position:0%
sometimes people feel so depressed about
 
06:11:54.070 --> 06:11:54.080 align:start position:0%
the future that they may consider
 
06:11:57.270 --> 06:11:57.280 align:start position:0%
attempting suicide that is taking some
 
06:11:59.430 --> 06:11:59.440 align:start position:0%
action to end their own life
 
06:12:01.270 --> 06:12:01.280 align:start position:0%
during the past 12 months did you ever
 
06:12:04.150 --> 06:12:04.160 align:start position:0%
feel so sad or hopeless almost every day
 
06:12:06.150 --> 06:12:06.160 align:start position:0%
for two weeks or more in a row that you
 
06:12:09.430 --> 06:12:09.440 align:start position:0%
stopped you doing some usual activities
 
06:12:11.270 --> 06:12:11.280 align:start position:0%
during the last 12 months did you ever
 
06:12:13.590 --> 06:12:13.600 align:start position:0%
seriously consider attempting suicide
 
06:12:15.270 --> 06:12:15.280 align:start position:0%
during the last 12 months did you ever
 
06:12:17.270 --> 06:12:17.280 align:start position:0%
make a plan about how you would attempt
 
06:12:19.990 --> 06:12:20.000 align:start position:0%
suicide during the last 12 months how
 
06:12:21.910 --> 06:12:21.920 align:start position:0%
many times did you actually attempt
 
06:12:21.920 --> 06:12:23.910 align:start position:0%
many times did you actually attempt
suicide

06:12:23.910 --> 06:12:23.920 align:start position:0%
suicide
 
06:12:25.590 --> 06:12:25.600 align:start position:0%
when you feel sad
 
06:12:27.990 --> 06:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
empty hopeless angry or anxious how
 
06:12:30.230 --> 06:12:30.240 align:start position:0%
often do you get the kind of help you
 
06:12:30.240 --> 06:12:32.868 align:start position:0%
often do you get the kind of help you
need

06:12:32.868 --> 06:12:32.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:35.030 --> 06:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
those questions alone for someone that's
 
06:12:37.190 --> 06:12:37.200 align:start position:0%
struggling with depression and leaving
 
06:12:39.350 --> 06:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
them with no one to follow up has now
 
06:12:41.750 --> 06:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
planted seeds in their mind with no one
 
06:12:43.670 --> 06:12:43.680 align:start position:0%
to talk to all they're going to do is
 
06:12:45.830 --> 06:12:45.840 align:start position:0%
play those ideas over and over in their
 
06:12:45.840 --> 06:12:47.510 align:start position:0%
play those ideas over and over in their
head

06:12:47.510 --> 06:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
head
 
06:12:49.910 --> 06:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
this is like a playbook for how to do
 
06:12:51.350 --> 06:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
bad things
 
06:12:54.470 --> 06:12:54.480 align:start position:0%

talking about how people are getting
 
06:14:38.470 --> 06:14:38.480 align:start position:0%
good information from this
 
06:14:40.868 --> 06:14:40.878 align:start position:0%
but my son went in and he said that he
 
06:14:44.830 --> 06:14:44.840 align:start position:0%
was a 200 pound black male or black
 
06:14:47.350 --> 06:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
female and said that most of the kids in
 
06:14:49.990 --> 06:14:50.000 align:start position:0%
this class did the same thing
 
06:14:52.390 --> 06:14:52.400 align:start position:0%
he said that
 
06:14:54.230 --> 06:14:54.240 align:start position:0%
they made jokes of it and they didn't
 
06:14:56.628 --> 06:14:56.638 align:start position:0%
take it seriously every testimony i've
 
06:14:59.030 --> 06:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
heard has said that these children are
 
06:15:01.430 --> 06:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
answering these questions correctly
 
06:15:03.430 --> 06:15:03.440 align:start position:0%
when you're asking about child abuse or
 
06:15:04.948 --> 06:15:04.958 align:start position:0%
if they've been sexually abused and
 
06:15:06.788 --> 06:15:06.798 align:start position:0%
you're expecting someone to be honest
 
06:15:08.948 --> 06:15:08.958 align:start position:0%
with you and not even being able to
 
06:15:08.958 --> 06:15:10.150 align:start position:0%
with you and not even being able to
connect

06:15:10.150 --> 06:15:10.160 align:start position:0%
connect
 
06:15:13.910 --> 06:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
i feel like these things are completely
 
06:15:13.920 --> 06:15:16.868 align:start position:0%
i feel like these things are completely
uh

06:15:16.868 --> 06:15:16.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:19.350 --> 06:15:19.360 align:start position:0%
ridiculous that you would believe that a
 
06:15:23.030 --> 06:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
teenage child anywhere from the ages of
 
06:15:25.110 --> 06:15:25.120 align:start position:0%
12 or 13 if they're starting in junior

06:15:36.948 --> 06:15:36.958 align:start position:0%
a week after this survey was given a boy
 
06:15:37.990 --> 06:15:38.000 align:start position:0%

community committed suicide
 
06:15:42.868 --> 06:15:42.878 align:start position:0%

teen screen that was enacted after

george w bush was in office in 2003
 
06:15:51.270 --> 06:15:51.280 align:start position:0%
started asking these kids questions
 
06:15:54.070 --> 06:15:54.080 align:start position:0%
what they found through their research
 
06:15:55.030 --> 06:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
is that
 
06:15:57.190 --> 06:15:57.200 align:start position:0%
the anxiety and the depression and the
 
06:15:59.910 --> 06:15:59.920 align:start position:0%
suicide rates were going up
 
06:16:02.470 --> 06:16:02.480 align:start position:0%
i had to do training uh on suicide
 
06:16:05.030 --> 06:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
awareness to volunteer in my school
 
06:16:07.110 --> 06:16:07.120 align:start position:0%
and in that survey
 
06:16:10.470 --> 06:16:10.480 align:start position:0%
or in in the um
 
06:16:13.270 --> 06:16:13.280 align:start position:0%
in the education it it referenced the
 
06:16:16.070 --> 06:16:16.080 align:start position:0%
cdc survey and that there was an
 
06:16:18.948 --> 06:16:18.958 align:start position:0%
increase significantly
 
06:16:21.350 --> 06:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
rate of suicides over the years it also
 
06:16:23.510 --> 06:16:23.520 align:start position:0%
said since the surveys come out they saw
 
06:16:26.030 --> 06:16:26.040 align:start position:0%
something they'd never seen before in
 
06:16:29.350 --> 06:16:29.360 align:start position:0%
2017 to 18 in jordan district utah where
 
06:16:31.350 --> 06:16:31.360 align:start position:0%
there were seven suicides they started
 
06:16:38.788 --> 06:16:38.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:41.190 --> 06:16:41.200 align:start position:0%
it not only talks about drinking drugs
 
06:16:44.628 --> 06:16:44.638 align:start position:0%
vaping sex abuse how often body weight
 
06:16:46.070 --> 06:16:46.080 align:start position:0%
and suicide
 
06:16:48.628 --> 06:16:48.638 align:start position:0%
but this is damaging questions for our
 
06:16:51.910 --> 06:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
children to be asked especially in light
 
06:16:53.910 --> 06:16:53.920 align:start position:0%
of the pandemic
 
06:16:56.150 --> 06:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
they don't know who to turn to
 
06:16:57.990 --> 06:16:58.000 align:start position:0%
the schools have put them on lockdowns
 
06:17:00.868 --> 06:17:00.878 align:start position:0%
and they don't have people to turn to
 
06:17:03.030 --> 06:17:03.040 align:start position:0%
and by giving them information that they
 
06:17:05.590 --> 06:17:05.600 align:start position:0%
don't know how to process you're hurting
 
06:17:05.600 --> 06:17:06.788 align:start position:0%
don't know how to process you're hurting
them

06:17:06.788 --> 06:17:06.798 align:start position:0%
them
 
06:17:08.708 --> 06:17:08.718 align:start position:0%
and as a parent i should have had the
 
06:17:11.670 --> 06:17:11.680 align:start position:0%
right to opt out but i didn't
 
06:17:11.680 --> 06:17:13.270 align:start position:0%
right to opt out but i didn't
instead

06:17:13.270 --> 06:17:13.280 align:start position:0%
instead
 
06:17:15.830 --> 06:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
the school destroyed the surveys
 
06:17:17.510 --> 06:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
and notified the parents that they had
 
06:17:20.070 --> 06:17:20.080 align:start position:0%
made a mistake but they broke the law
 
06:17:22.390 --> 06:17:22.400 align:start position:0%
and they never emailed the survey to
 
06:17:24.708 --> 06:17:24.718 align:start position:0%
the parents so all of the other parents
 
06:17:26.390 --> 06:17:26.400 align:start position:0%
that didn't do their due diligence to
 
06:17:28.230 --> 06:17:28.240 align:start position:0%
look up this survey
 
06:17:30.150 --> 06:17:30.160 align:start position:0%
now have no idea what their kids might
 
06:17:32.070 --> 06:17:32.080 align:start position:0%
have been exposed to
 
06:17:34.310 --> 06:17:34.320 align:start position:0%
so i'm asking you to think about the
 
06:17:36.628 --> 06:17:36.638 align:start position:0%
students and what the parents think is
 
06:17:38.868 --> 06:17:38.878 align:start position:0%
best for their children
 
06:17:42.310 --> 06:17:42.320 align:start position:0%
because i i can guarantee you that
 
06:17:45.110 --> 06:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
most parents would not feel comfortable
 
06:17:47.990 --> 06:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
with someone a school administrator or
 
06:17:50.230 --> 06:17:50.240 align:start position:0%
teacher asking them these questions and
 
06:17:51.910 --> 06:17:51.920 align:start position:0%
not following it up
 
06:17:54.070 --> 06:17:54.080 align:start position:0%
and there were some kids at this school
 
06:17:55.990 --> 06:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
that actually put their name on the
 
06:17:56.000 --> 06:17:57.270 align:start position:0%
that actually put their name on the
survey

06:17:57.270 --> 06:17:57.280 align:start position:0%
survey
 
06:17:58.868 --> 06:17:58.878 align:start position:0%
because they didn't realize that it
 
06:18:01.910 --> 06:18:01.920 align:start position:0%
wasn't a test you have no control over
 
06:18:05.910 --> 06:18:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:09.110 --> 06:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
in bedford a father was very upset
 
06:18:11.350 --> 06:18:11.360 align:start position:0%
and he went to the school and he told
 
06:18:13.910 --> 06:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
them that he wanted them to find his
 
06:18:16.310 --> 06:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
students survey and destroy it and the
 
06:18:19.350 --> 06:18:19.360 align:start position:0%
school found it and destroyed it
 
06:18:21.590 --> 06:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
you can't sit here everyone that just
 
06:18:23.990 --> 06:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
testified and tell me they don't know
 
06:18:25.590 --> 06:18:25.600 align:start position:0%
who these kids are because if they
 
06:18:27.750 --> 06:18:27.760 align:start position:0%
answer the questions correctly
 
06:18:29.350 --> 06:18:29.360 align:start position:0%
they know
 
06:18:31.430 --> 06:18:31.440 align:start position:0%
the first several questions of the
 
06:18:31.440 --> 06:18:33.030 align:start position:0%
the first several questions of the
survey

06:18:33.030 --> 06:18:33.040 align:start position:0%
survey
 
06:18:35.110 --> 06:18:35.120 align:start position:0%
paint a clear picture
 
06:18:37.670 --> 06:18:37.680 align:start position:0%
i think i read within three questions
 
06:18:40.628 --> 06:18:40.638 align:start position:0%
they could determine the student
 
06:18:42.548 --> 06:18:42.558 align:start position:0%
so i'm asking
 
06:18:45.590 --> 06:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
that you pass this and protect the
 
06:18:47.750 --> 06:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
parent parents rights
 
06:18:51.350 --> 06:18:51.360 align:start position:0%
and protect our our children
 
06:18:52.868 --> 06:18:52.878 align:start position:0%
and i would also
 
06:18:55.270 --> 06:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
recommend that each one of you reads
 
06:18:58.548 --> 06:18:58.558 align:start position:0%
through the 106 questions on the survey
 
06:19:00.390 --> 06:19:00.400 align:start position:0%
and think about how you would feel if
 
06:19:03.590 --> 06:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
that was given to your child
 
06:19:05.510 --> 06:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:19:07.990 --> 06:19:08.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there is there
 
06:19:09.350 --> 06:19:09.360 align:start position:0%
anybody from the committee would like to
 
06:19:12.310 --> 06:19:12.320 align:start position:0%
ask a question
 
06:19:14.310 --> 06:19:14.320 align:start position:0%
yes representative nelson thank you i'm
 
06:19:16.150 --> 06:19:16.160 align:start position:0%
not sure this you could answer this but
 
06:19:18.070 --> 06:19:18.080 align:start position:0%
you have any idea how special needs
 
06:19:20.708 --> 06:19:20.718 align:start position:0%
students or administered that uh
 
06:19:22.548 --> 06:19:22.558 align:start position:0%
somebody that difficulty reading with a
 
06:19:24.468 --> 06:19:24.478 align:start position:0%
teacher ever read it read them the
 
06:19:26.230 --> 06:19:26.240 align:start position:0%
questions or you have any idea my
 
06:19:28.548 --> 06:19:28.558 align:start position:0%
understanding was is that they brought
 
06:19:31.190 --> 06:19:31.200 align:start position:0%
two of the cav blocks together in hollis
 
06:19:33.190 --> 06:19:33.200 align:start position:0%
and they had two teachers there and one
 
06:19:35.990 --> 06:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
of them administered it if they had a
 
06:19:38.830 --> 06:19:38.840 align:start position:0%
para i don't know because um
 
06:19:42.150 --> 06:19:42.160 align:start position:0%
my i don't think that my children have
 
06:19:44.230 --> 06:19:44.240 align:start position:0%
any special need children in their calf
 
06:19:44.240 --> 06:19:45.350 align:start position:0%
any special need children in their calf
blocks

06:19:45.350 --> 06:19:45.360 align:start position:0%
blocks
 
06:19:48.070 --> 06:19:48.080 align:start position:0%
um because i think that calf locks use
 
06:19:51.190 --> 06:19:51.200 align:start position:0%
as a time where people can meet with um
 
06:19:54.628 --> 06:19:54.638 align:start position:0%
other teachers for extra help
 
06:19:55.990 --> 06:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
are there further questions from the
 
06:19:56.000 --> 06:19:58.468 align:start position:0%
are there further questions from the
committee

06:19:58.468 --> 06:19:58.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:00.310 --> 06:20:00.320 align:start position:0%

06:20:32.310 --> 06:20:32.320 align:start position:0%
so so folks can get up and stretch those
 
06:20:35.830 --> 06:20:35.840 align:start position:0%

06:21:00.230 --> 06:21:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:02.310 --> 06:21:02.320 align:start position:0%
i don't know i wouldn't trust the water
 
06:21:04.070 --> 06:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
in the machine though it's probably over
 
06:21:05.350 --> 06:21:05.360 align:start position:0%
a year old
 
06:21:12.548 --> 06:21:12.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:14.390 --> 06:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
that'll get you awake if it touches
 
06:21:14.400 --> 06:21:24.230 align:start position:0%
that'll get you awake if it touches
anything

06:21:24.230 --> 06:21:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:25.270 --> 06:21:25.280 align:start position:0%
i know you're not supposed to drink
 
06:34:20.230 --> 06:34:20.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:21.350 --> 06:34:21.360 align:start position:0%

the bill is relative to programs for
 
06:35:08.948 --> 06:35:08.958 align:start position:0%
credit leading to high school graduation
 
06:35:12.070 --> 06:35:12.080 align:start position:0%
and allows it to also be done beyond
 
06:35:14.150 --> 06:35:14.160 align:start position:0%
where we do it now with the high schools
 
06:35:16.788 --> 06:35:16.798 align:start position:0%
but would pursuant to the state board of
 
06:35:19.190 --> 06:35:19.200 align:start position:0%
education adopting rules which will
 
06:35:22.310 --> 06:35:22.320 align:start position:0%
enable that board to also recognize
 
06:35:24.310 --> 06:35:24.320 align:start position:0%
that a course taken
 
06:35:25.830 --> 06:35:25.840 align:start position:0%
is going to give you credit for
 
06:35:25.840 --> 06:35:27.510 align:start position:0%
is going to give you credit for
graduation

06:35:27.510 --> 06:35:27.520 align:start position:0%
graduation
 
06:35:29.990 --> 06:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
this bill as you see it right here
 
06:35:33.110 --> 06:35:33.120 align:start position:0%
is the exact exact wording that was in
 
06:35:36.708 --> 06:35:36.718 align:start position:0%
242 hb 242.
 
06:35:39.830 --> 06:35:39.840 align:start position:0%
we've discussed it before many a time
 
06:35:41.590 --> 06:35:41.600 align:start position:0%
so i'm not going to take the time to go
 
06:35:43.430 --> 06:35:43.440 align:start position:0%
in it and over it and over and over
 
06:35:45.670 --> 06:35:45.680 align:start position:0%
again i think it reads pretty simply
 
06:35:46.948 --> 06:35:46.958 align:start position:0%
that the
 
06:35:46.958 --> 06:35:48.150 align:start position:0%
that the
the

06:35:48.150 --> 06:35:48.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:35:51.510 --> 06:35:51.520 align:start position:0%
if a student has taken a course in an
 
06:35:54.390 --> 06:35:54.400 align:start position:0%
alternative learning program that credit
 
06:35:57.430 --> 06:35:57.440 align:start position:0%
if not awarded by the high school itself
 
06:35:58.868 --> 06:35:58.878 align:start position:0%
or the district
 
06:36:00.948 --> 06:36:00.958 align:start position:0%
can be if it's in accordance with the
 
06:36:03.030 --> 06:36:03.040 align:start position:0%
rules and if that program was accepted
 
06:36:05.110 --> 06:36:05.120 align:start position:0%
and approved by the state board
 
06:36:06.948 --> 06:36:06.958 align:start position:0%
and meets the competencies as
 
06:36:06.958 --> 06:36:08.230 align:start position:0%
and meets the competencies as
established

06:36:08.230 --> 06:36:08.240 align:start position:0%
established
 
06:36:11.030 --> 06:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
within the high school course
 
06:36:12.788 --> 06:36:12.798 align:start position:0%
then they will get credit for that
 
06:36:12.798 --> 06:36:13.670 align:start position:0%
then they will get credit for that
course

06:36:13.670 --> 06:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
course
 
06:36:16.390 --> 06:36:16.400 align:start position:0%
i want to also make a note that you have
 
06:36:18.468 --> 06:36:18.478 align:start position:0%
another bill in front of you today
 
06:36:21.910 --> 06:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
not today but in your bills for this
 
06:36:21.920 --> 06:36:23.830 align:start position:0%
not today but in your bills for this
month

06:36:23.830 --> 06:36:23.840 align:start position:0%
month
 
06:36:25.910 --> 06:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
hb 1661
 
06:36:27.750 --> 06:36:27.760 align:start position:0%
that's a bill regional career technical
 
06:36:30.070 --> 06:36:30.080 align:start position:0%
education agreements
 
06:36:32.390 --> 06:36:32.400 align:start position:0%
now if you look at that bill you're also
 
06:36:34.948 --> 06:36:34.958 align:start position:0%
going to see very similar wording in it
 
06:36:38.070 --> 06:36:38.080 align:start position:0%
the uh career technical education
 
06:36:39.830 --> 06:36:39.840 align:start position:0%
committee that we have studying tuition
 
06:36:41.350 --> 06:36:41.360 align:start position:0%
and transportation
 
06:36:44.628 --> 06:36:44.638 align:start position:0%
also the advisory council has looked at
 
06:36:46.390 --> 06:36:46.400 align:start position:0%
that bill so i won't go into it because
 
06:36:48.548 --> 06:36:48.558 align:start position:0%
we haven't introduced it yet but there's
 
06:36:52.230 --> 06:36:52.240 align:start position:0%
language within it that reads
 
06:36:54.948 --> 06:36:54.958 align:start position:0%
a student completing an embedded career
 
06:36:56.468 --> 06:36:56.478 align:start position:0%
technical education course who
 
06:36:58.390 --> 06:36:58.400 align:start position:0%
demonstrates proficiency in the embedded
 
06:37:00.788 --> 06:37:00.798 align:start position:0%
course at competencies as approved by
 
06:37:03.270 --> 06:37:03.280 align:start position:0%
the sending district board under terms
 
06:37:06.230 --> 06:37:06.240 align:start position:0%
of the rctea agreement you'll get that
 
06:37:09.030 --> 06:37:09.040 align:start position:0%
later or by the state board of education
 
06:37:10.948 --> 06:37:10.958 align:start position:0%
shall have such credits counted toward
 
06:37:13.670 --> 06:37:13.680 align:start position:0%
required program area for a high school
 
06:37:15.910 --> 06:37:15.920 align:start position:0%
degree or diploma
 
06:37:18.468 --> 06:37:18.478 align:start position:0%
we've had
 
06:37:20.948 --> 06:37:20.958 align:start position:0%
direct communication
 
06:37:20.958 --> 06:37:22.948 align:start position:0%
direct communication
from

06:37:22.948 --> 06:37:22.958 align:start position:0%
from
 
06:37:25.830 --> 06:37:25.840 align:start position:0%
uh directors of the cte centers and
 
06:37:27.590 --> 06:37:27.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to be a ct center we've
 
06:37:29.430 --> 06:37:29.440 align:start position:0%
also had the communication from others
 
06:37:31.670 --> 06:37:31.680 align:start position:0%
regarding transfer of credit to the
 
06:37:34.070 --> 06:37:34.080 align:start position:0%
that's been previously uh obtained
 
06:37:36.230 --> 06:37:36.240 align:start position:0%
elsewhere be it in a school which is an
 
06:37:38.230 --> 06:37:38.240 align:start position:0%
approved school be it a school that's
 
06:37:40.070 --> 06:37:40.080 align:start position:0%
accredited with the same association we
 
06:37:42.070 --> 06:37:42.080 align:start position:0%
accredit our schools
 
06:37:44.150 --> 06:37:44.160 align:start position:0%
but we know that
 
06:37:46.548 --> 06:37:46.558 align:start position:0%
in regard to the cte program
 
06:37:48.628 --> 06:37:48.638 align:start position:0%
which is very similar to this
 
06:37:50.708 --> 06:37:50.718 align:start position:0%
concept and this whole idea of the state
 
06:37:52.708 --> 06:37:52.718 align:start position:0%
board getting engaged
 
06:37:55.350 --> 06:37:55.360 align:start position:0%
there are some sending districts
 
06:37:57.910 --> 06:37:57.920 align:start position:0%
even though the competencies that are
 
06:38:00.070 --> 06:38:00.080 align:start position:0%
taught in that chemistry class back in
 
06:38:02.150 --> 06:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
the sending district
 
06:38:05.990 --> 06:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
are taught in a part of the programming
 
06:38:08.548 --> 06:38:08.558 align:start position:0%
at the cte center
 
06:38:11.110 --> 06:38:11.120 align:start position:0%
the student must take
 
06:38:14.468 --> 06:38:14.478 align:start position:0%
the required course at the sending
 
06:38:14.478 --> 06:38:16.070 align:start position:0%
the required course at the sending
school

06:38:16.070 --> 06:38:16.080 align:start position:0%
school
 
06:38:17.430 --> 06:38:17.440 align:start position:0%
this has
 
06:38:19.190 --> 06:38:19.200 align:start position:0%
resulted in
 
06:38:20.390 --> 06:38:20.400 align:start position:0%
many students
 
06:38:21.990 --> 06:38:22.000 align:start position:0%
that are going from sending schools to
 
06:38:24.468 --> 06:38:24.478 align:start position:0%
career tech centers not able to go
 
06:38:25.910 --> 06:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
seeing they have to stay back to take
 
06:38:27.830 --> 06:38:27.840 align:start position:0%
that one course that they need for
 
06:38:27.840 --> 06:38:29.110 align:start position:0%
that one course that they need for
graduation

06:38:29.110 --> 06:38:29.120 align:start position:0%
graduation
 
06:38:30.628 --> 06:38:30.638 align:start position:0%
rather than getting involved with a
 
06:38:32.390 --> 06:38:32.400 align:start position:0%
skill oriented program at the cte
 
06:38:32.400 --> 06:38:33.670 align:start position:0%
skill oriented program at the cte
centers

06:38:33.670 --> 06:38:33.680 align:start position:0%
centers
 
06:38:35.830 --> 06:38:35.840 align:start position:0%
this this particular concept has been
 
06:38:38.708 --> 06:38:38.718 align:start position:0%
discussed over and over and over again
 
06:38:40.628 --> 06:38:40.638 align:start position:0%
at various meetings we've had throughout
 
06:38:40.638 --> 06:38:41.350 align:start position:0%
at various meetings we've had throughout
the

06:38:41.350 --> 06:38:41.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:38:43.430 --> 06:38:43.440 align:start position:0%
last spring summer fall
 
06:38:45.350 --> 06:38:45.360 align:start position:0%
with directors with
 
06:38:47.830 --> 06:38:47.840 align:start position:0%
cte people and they're all agreement
 
06:38:49.990 --> 06:38:50.000 align:start position:0%
we've got to get on the same page here
 
06:38:52.150 --> 06:38:52.160 align:start position:0%
and we need to get our 10th 11th and
 
06:38:52.160 --> 06:38:53.030 align:start position:0%
and we need to get our 10th 11th and
12th

06:38:53.030 --> 06:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
12th
 
06:38:55.110 --> 06:38:55.120 align:start position:0%
grade kids engaged
 
06:38:57.750 --> 06:38:57.760 align:start position:0%
in learning at these centers we have far
 
06:39:00.310 --> 06:39:00.320 align:start position:0%
too few kids in that pro in the program
 
06:39:02.390 --> 06:39:02.400 align:start position:0%
right now compared to other states like
 
06:39:04.868 --> 06:39:04.878 align:start position:0%
delaware where they have over 50 percent
 
06:39:06.788 --> 06:39:06.798 align:start position:0%
of their high school students have taken
 
06:39:09.830 --> 06:39:09.840 align:start position:0%
at least one cte program in our state
 
06:39:12.548 --> 06:39:12.558 align:start position:0%
it's 17 percent same amount of kids in
 
06:39:14.390 --> 06:39:14.400 align:start position:0%
delaware as there are here in new
 
06:39:16.868 --> 06:39:16.878 align:start position:0%
hampshire we have a problem
 
06:39:18.708 --> 06:39:18.718 align:start position:0%
the majority of kids taking courses at
 
06:39:21.430 --> 06:39:21.440 align:start position:0%
the cte centers are 70 percent
 
06:39:23.750 --> 06:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
in that school itself like a candidate
 
06:39:25.830 --> 06:39:25.840 align:start position:0%
which has the cte right there in its
 
06:39:28.708 --> 06:39:28.718 align:start position:0%
school which is a great program
 
06:39:30.468 --> 06:39:30.478 align:start position:0%
or in any of the other schools which
 
06:39:32.230 --> 06:39:32.240 align:start position:0%
where they're this they're embedded like
 
06:39:33.910 --> 06:39:33.920 align:start position:0%
concord high
 
06:39:35.750 --> 06:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
however if you look at those sending
 
06:39:38.070 --> 06:39:38.080 align:start position:0%
districts that's where the percentages
 
06:39:39.510 --> 06:39:39.520 align:start position:0%
start really
 
06:39:41.430 --> 06:39:41.440 align:start position:0%
significantly dropping off in
 
06:39:43.910 --> 06:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
participation transportation et cetera
 
06:39:46.788 --> 06:39:46.798 align:start position:0%
and also someone being held back
 
06:39:49.190 --> 06:39:49.200 align:start position:0%
uh by people are saying no you will take
 
06:39:51.750 --> 06:39:51.760 align:start position:0%
it in my course at the ascending school
 
06:39:54.070 --> 06:39:54.080 align:start position:0%
you will not get it embedded in so
 
06:39:55.430 --> 06:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
that's the same concern that we have
 
06:39:56.708 --> 06:39:56.718 align:start position:0%
within the bill we're talking about
 
06:39:57.830 --> 06:39:57.840 align:start position:0%
right here
 
06:39:59.990 --> 06:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
that there is a need due especially
 
06:40:01.910 --> 06:40:01.920 align:start position:0%
during this period of covid
 
06:40:03.590 --> 06:40:03.600 align:start position:0%
where we're having to look at so many
 
06:40:05.910 --> 06:40:05.920 align:start position:0%
different options now where we've had
 
06:40:09.190 --> 06:40:09.200 align:start position:0%
schools legitimately not in session at
 
06:40:10.708 --> 06:40:10.718 align:start position:0%
the school we've had to zoom we've had
 
06:40:13.830 --> 06:40:13.840 align:start position:0%
to do this or that and and i understand
 
06:40:16.548 --> 06:40:16.558 align:start position:0%
all that however we are seeing
 
06:40:19.830 --> 06:40:19.840 align:start position:0%
significant drops in the achievement of
 
06:40:19.840 --> 06:40:21.350 align:start position:0%
significant drops in the achievement of
kids

06:40:21.350 --> 06:40:21.360 align:start position:0%
kids
 
06:40:23.110 --> 06:40:23.120 align:start position:0%
we've seen it it's documented in
 
06:40:25.190 --> 06:40:25.200 align:start position:0%
mathematics we've gone from the
 
06:40:27.590 --> 06:40:27.600 align:start position:0%
48th percentile level of proficiency
 
06:40:30.868 --> 06:40:30.878 align:start position:0%
level to 38 proficiency in public
 
06:40:33.430 --> 06:40:33.440 align:start position:0%
education in mathematics we have long
 
06:40:35.670 --> 06:40:35.680 align:start position:0%
ways to go that's we're going to have to
 
06:40:38.230 --> 06:40:38.240 align:start position:0%
start relying upon these other options
 
06:40:41.590 --> 06:40:41.600 align:start position:0%
as well as offering to tutorial services
 
06:40:43.510 --> 06:40:43.520 align:start position:0%
remediation in our public schools help
 
06:40:45.430 --> 06:40:45.440 align:start position:0%
kids out we need to have this
 
06:40:47.270 --> 06:40:47.280 align:start position:0%
alternative program of learning these
 
06:40:49.750 --> 06:40:49.760 align:start position:0%
programs are approved by the department
 
06:40:49.760 --> 06:40:50.788 align:start position:0%
programs are approved by the department
and

06:40:50.788 --> 06:40:50.798 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:40:53.110 --> 06:40:53.120 align:start position:0%
therefore they do meet the competencies
 
06:40:54.948 --> 06:40:54.958 align:start position:0%
so in conclusion i would like to see
 
06:40:57.110 --> 06:40:57.120 align:start position:0%
this bill go forward thank you
 
06:40:59.590 --> 06:40:59.600 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative
 
06:41:01.990 --> 06:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
representative porter
 
06:41:04.468 --> 06:41:04.478 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um for letting me ask
 
06:41:06.548 --> 06:41:06.558 align:start position:0%
my question and thank you representative
 
06:41:08.468 --> 06:41:08.478 align:start position:0%
i was not part of all those other
 
06:41:10.070 --> 06:41:10.080 align:start position:0%
conversations as i'm new on the
 
06:41:10.080 --> 06:41:11.030 align:start position:0%
conversations as i'm new on the
committee

06:41:11.030 --> 06:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
committee
 
06:41:13.430 --> 06:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
and as i'm understanding this bill not
 
06:41:15.590 --> 06:41:15.600 align:start position:0%
the one about the ctes
 
06:41:15.600 --> 06:41:16.390 align:start position:0%
the one about the ctes
that

06:41:16.390 --> 06:41:16.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:41:19.270 --> 06:41:19.280 align:start position:0%
the state department of education can
 
06:41:19.280 --> 06:41:20.948 align:start position:0%
the state department of education can
override

06:41:20.948 --> 06:41:20.958 align:start position:0%
override
 
06:41:23.830 --> 06:41:23.840 align:start position:0%
the local school board that the decision
 
06:41:26.310 --> 06:41:26.320 align:start position:0%
of what counts for graduation
 
06:41:29.830 --> 06:41:29.840 align:start position:0%
in a local district is no longer
 
06:41:32.310 --> 06:41:32.320 align:start position:0%
the record is no longer what the school
 
06:41:34.230 --> 06:41:34.240 align:start position:0%
board says it is the school board has
 
06:41:36.548 --> 06:41:36.558 align:start position:0%
now given that over to the local to the
 
06:41:38.390 --> 06:41:38.400 align:start position:0%
state board of education
 
06:41:42.708 --> 06:41:42.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:45.910 --> 06:41:45.920 align:start position:0%
the state board is not can i can can i i
 
06:41:47.270 --> 06:41:47.280 align:start position:0%
want to tell you a story that happened
 
06:41:49.910 --> 06:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
in hillsboro just a brief story a young
 
06:41:49.920 --> 06:41:51.350 align:start position:0%
in hillsboro just a brief story a young
girl

06:41:51.350 --> 06:41:51.360 align:start position:0%
girl
 
06:41:52.548 --> 06:41:52.558 align:start position:0%
decided she didn't want to go to
 
06:41:55.030 --> 06:41:55.040 align:start position:0%
hillsboro anymore got involved in a
 
06:41:58.390 --> 06:41:58.400 align:start position:0%
program in concord she was a senior
 
06:42:00.788 --> 06:42:00.798 align:start position:0%
she finished up the year
 
06:42:02.708 --> 06:42:02.718 align:start position:0%
in the concord program
 
06:42:05.510 --> 06:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
and wanted to come back and graduate in
 
06:42:07.190 --> 06:42:07.200 align:start position:0%
hillsborough with her
 
06:42:09.510 --> 06:42:09.520 align:start position:0%
her old grade mates
 
06:42:11.750 --> 06:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
and there was a big concern at that time
 
06:42:13.590 --> 06:42:13.600 align:start position:0%
and a lot of public
 
06:42:13.600 --> 06:42:15.350 align:start position:0%
and a lot of public
unhappiness

06:42:15.350 --> 06:42:15.360 align:start position:0%
unhappiness
 
06:42:17.670 --> 06:42:17.680 align:start position:0%
because the public
 
06:42:20.150 --> 06:42:20.160 align:start position:0%
said she had not met the requirements
 
06:42:22.548 --> 06:42:22.558 align:start position:0%
that hillsborough had for its students
 
06:42:24.708 --> 06:42:24.718 align:start position:0%
to graduate she had met requirements
 
06:42:27.110 --> 06:42:27.120 align:start position:0%
from a different place and therefore she
 
06:42:30.150 --> 06:42:30.160 align:start position:0%
had not res she was not eligible to
 
06:42:33.270 --> 06:42:33.280 align:start position:0%
receive a diploma from hillsboro during
 
06:42:35.590 --> 06:42:35.600 align:start position:0%
high school so that's an actual thing
 
06:42:37.030 --> 06:42:37.040 align:start position:0%
that happened in my community a few
 
06:42:38.150 --> 06:42:38.160 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
06:42:40.390 --> 06:42:40.400 align:start position:0%
and i'm seeing with this something
 
06:42:40.400 --> 06:42:41.350 align:start position:0%
and i'm seeing with this something
similar

06:42:41.350 --> 06:42:41.360 align:start position:0%
similar
 
06:42:43.190 --> 06:42:43.200 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden the state board is
 
06:42:46.468 --> 06:42:46.478 align:start position:0%
saying that sally jones can take this
 
06:42:46.478 --> 06:42:47.270 align:start position:0%
saying that sally jones can take this
in

06:42:47.270 --> 06:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
in
 
06:42:48.628 --> 06:42:48.638 align:start position:0%
another town
 
06:42:51.110 --> 06:42:51.120 align:start position:0%
and come back and still graduate
 
06:42:53.030 --> 06:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
with her class even though it doesn't
 
06:42:55.430 --> 06:42:55.440 align:start position:0%
meet the requirements that hillsboro has
 
06:42:55.440 --> 06:42:56.310 align:start position:0%
meet the requirements that hillsboro has
set

06:42:56.310 --> 06:42:56.320 align:start position:0%
set
 
06:42:58.070 --> 06:42:58.080 align:start position:0%
so that's why i'm concerned about this
 
06:43:00.310 --> 06:43:00.320 align:start position:0%
bill and that's why i asked the question
 
06:43:01.910 --> 06:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
the question should be answered has
 
06:43:04.390 --> 06:43:04.400 align:start position:0%
sally jones master the competencies
 
06:43:06.868 --> 06:43:06.878 align:start position:0%
relative to that particular course that
 
06:43:08.468 --> 06:43:08.478 align:start position:0%
she's not getting credit for or having
 
06:43:10.390 --> 06:43:10.400 align:start position:0%
to take again
 
06:43:12.310 --> 06:43:12.320 align:start position:0%
we have forgotten that when we made a
 
06:43:14.070 --> 06:43:14.080 align:start position:0%
move to go forward when commissioner
 
06:43:15.510 --> 06:43:15.520 align:start position:0%
barry was here
 
06:43:17.910 --> 06:43:17.920 align:start position:0%
the idea of instruction is based upon
 
06:43:20.708 --> 06:43:20.718 align:start position:0%
competencies it's not seat time it's not
 
06:43:22.628 --> 06:43:22.638 align:start position:0%
where you're taking this class or
 
06:43:25.510 --> 06:43:25.520 align:start position:0%
program it's what you have gained or
 
06:43:27.430 --> 06:43:27.440 align:start position:0%
learned it's whether you have attained
 
06:43:30.070 --> 06:43:30.080 align:start position:0%
that learning target if you've attained
 
06:43:32.070 --> 06:43:32.080 align:start position:0%
that learning target if you can
 
06:43:33.590 --> 06:43:33.600 align:start position:0%
demonstrate that you have those
 
06:43:35.670 --> 06:43:35.680 align:start position:0%
competencies then i would say the
 
06:43:37.750 --> 06:43:37.760 align:start position:0%
student absolutely deserves to have that
 
06:43:40.788 --> 06:43:40.798 align:start position:0%
counsel account course that course count
 
06:43:40.798 --> 06:43:41.910 align:start position:0%
counsel account course that course count
towards

06:43:41.910 --> 06:43:41.920 align:start position:0%
towards
 
06:43:44.868 --> 06:43:44.878 align:start position:0%
graduation and move on
 
06:43:47.110 --> 06:43:47.120 align:start position:0%
rather than getting taught in this old
 
06:43:49.030 --> 06:43:49.040 align:start position:0%
regiment that we have you're going to
 
06:43:50.548 --> 06:43:50.558 align:start position:0%
have to do everything
 
06:43:53.190 --> 06:43:53.200 align:start position:0%
lock stock barrel in this school
 
06:43:55.350 --> 06:43:55.360 align:start position:0%
and and step with every other student
 
06:43:57.750 --> 06:43:57.760 align:start position:0%
that's not the way how life is and it
 
06:44:00.948 --> 06:44:00.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:03.750 --> 06:44:03.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative taner
 
06:44:05.670 --> 06:44:05.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
06:44:08.868 --> 06:44:08.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:12.468 --> 06:44:12.478 align:start position:0%
i recently asked uh attorney fenton uh
 
06:44:14.230 --> 06:44:14.240 align:start position:0%
and i think she's in the process of
 
06:44:16.468 --> 06:44:16.478 align:start position:0%
doing that sending me the the rules from
 
06:44:18.390 --> 06:44:18.400 align:start position:0%
the department of education
 
06:44:21.030 --> 06:44:21.040 align:start position:0%
um about how
 
06:44:23.830 --> 06:44:23.840 align:start position:0%
how they vet
 
06:44:25.670 --> 06:44:25.680 align:start position:0%
how they
 
06:44:27.430 --> 06:44:27.440 align:start position:0%
get the valid completion certificate
 
06:44:29.510 --> 06:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
from the state board of education for
 
06:44:32.310 --> 06:44:32.320 align:start position:0%
alternative programs
 
06:44:35.030 --> 06:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
and i'm wondering how
 
06:44:36.948 --> 06:44:36.958 align:start position:0%
they determine the state board of
 
06:44:39.110 --> 06:44:39.120 align:start position:0%
education which i may find out but maybe
 
06:44:41.830 --> 06:44:41.840 align:start position:0%
you know how they decide
 
06:44:43.510 --> 06:44:43.520 align:start position:0%
whether it's a quarter credit half
 
06:44:43.520 --> 06:44:44.548 align:start position:0%
whether it's a quarter credit half
credit

06:44:44.548 --> 06:44:44.558 align:start position:0%
credit
 
06:44:46.788 --> 06:44:46.798 align:start position:0%
full credit two credits
 
06:44:50.628 --> 06:44:50.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:52.468 --> 06:44:52.478 align:start position:0%
i recently talked to a superintendent in
 
06:44:54.150 --> 06:44:54.160 align:start position:0%
my area just to give you a little
 
06:44:57.030 --> 06:44:57.040 align:start position:0%
anecdotal thing and somebody showed up
 
06:44:58.708 --> 06:44:58.718 align:start position:0%
at the high school door
 
06:45:00.708 --> 06:45:00.718 align:start position:0%
a parent with their child
 
06:45:03.590 --> 06:45:03.600 align:start position:0%
who said that their child belong in in
 
06:45:07.270 --> 06:45:07.280 align:start position:0%
uh the junior year of school and
 
06:45:09.030 --> 06:45:09.040 align:start position:0%
they asked for
 
06:45:10.868 --> 06:45:10.878 align:start position:0%
you know some sort of transcript where's
 
06:45:13.270 --> 06:45:13.280 align:start position:0%
the transcript where's
 
06:45:15.670 --> 06:45:15.680 align:start position:0%
some level of
 
06:45:17.990 --> 06:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
what this child had completed and the
 
06:45:20.390 --> 06:45:20.400 align:start position:0%
parent merely turned over
 
06:45:22.548 --> 06:45:22.558 align:start position:0%
a sheet handwritten sheet of paper and
 
06:45:24.310 --> 06:45:24.320 align:start position:0%
said they've done math they've done
 
06:45:27.110 --> 06:45:27.120 align:start position:0%
english they've done whatever
 
06:45:31.190 --> 06:45:31.200 align:start position:0%
and you have to accept this and um
 
06:45:32.788 --> 06:45:32.798 align:start position:0%
you know i think there's two sides of
 
06:45:35.750 --> 06:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
the story i really i thoroughly agree
 
06:45:35.760 --> 06:45:36.708 align:start position:0%
the story i really i thoroughly agree
that

06:45:36.708 --> 06:45:36.718 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:45:38.708 --> 06:45:38.718 align:start position:0%
people need to be outside the school
 
06:45:41.830 --> 06:45:41.840 align:start position:0%
system uh doors outside the school doors
 
06:45:45.030 --> 06:45:45.040 align:start position:0%
taking classes having experiences
 
06:45:46.830 --> 06:45:46.840 align:start position:0%
getting credit for it
 
06:45:49.990 --> 06:45:50.000 align:start position:0%
um and getting that through competencies
 
06:45:51.670 --> 06:45:51.680 align:start position:0%
and i think the schools
 
06:45:53.830 --> 06:45:53.840 align:start position:0%
normally write up the competencies that
 
06:45:53.840 --> 06:45:54.548 align:start position:0%
normally write up the competencies that
the

06:45:54.548 --> 06:45:54.558 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:45:57.510 --> 06:45:57.520 align:start position:0%
that the students pass or
 
06:45:59.430 --> 06:45:59.440 align:start position:0%
achieve and get a certain amount of
 
06:46:02.468 --> 06:46:02.478 align:start position:0%
credit for it i'm just wondering how how
 
06:46:04.948 --> 06:46:04.958 align:start position:0%
credit is determined
 
06:46:07.750 --> 06:46:07.760 align:start position:0%
uh at the state level for
 
06:46:08.868 --> 06:46:08.878 align:start position:0%
you know
 
06:46:10.708 --> 06:46:10.718 align:start position:0%
what they're completing
 
06:46:12.948 --> 06:46:12.958 align:start position:0%
for example can a kid
 
06:46:15.910 --> 06:46:15.920 align:start position:0%
get a job at hannaford's be a checkout
 
06:46:15.920 --> 06:46:17.030 align:start position:0%
get a job at hannaford's be a checkout
clerk

06:46:17.030 --> 06:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
clerk
 
06:46:19.190 --> 06:46:19.200 align:start position:0%
you know learn how to do money maybe
 
06:46:21.430 --> 06:46:21.440 align:start position:0%
learn how to do stocking
 
06:46:23.110 --> 06:46:23.120 align:start position:0%
shelves and stuff like that and get a
 
06:46:25.270 --> 06:46:25.280 align:start position:0%
basic math credit for it
 
06:46:27.910 --> 06:46:27.920 align:start position:0%
well that's why we have uh education 306
 
06:46:27.920 --> 06:46:29.430 align:start position:0%
well that's why we have uh education 306
it's

06:46:29.430 --> 06:46:29.440 align:start position:0%
it's
 
06:46:31.830 --> 06:46:31.840 align:start position:0%
standards for public school approval uh
 
06:46:33.270 --> 06:46:33.280 align:start position:0%
minimum standards for public school
 
06:46:36.468 --> 06:46:36.478 align:start position:0%
approval and within that if we you look
 
06:46:37.910 --> 06:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
at the book you're going to see that how
 
06:46:39.510 --> 06:46:39.520 align:start position:0%
many credits are awarded for various
 
06:46:43.110 --> 06:46:43.120 align:start position:0%
types of courses that's all within 306.
 
06:46:45.190 --> 06:46:45.200 align:start position:0%
that's that's not in
 
06:46:47.270 --> 06:46:47.280 align:start position:0%
this book that we have right
 
06:46:49.590 --> 06:46:49.600 align:start position:0%
no you're looking at the statutes uh
 
06:46:52.628 --> 06:46:52.638 align:start position:0%
three zero six are rules okay
 
06:46:54.390 --> 06:46:54.400 align:start position:0%
and so then you better get your rules
 
06:46:56.310 --> 06:46:56.320 align:start position:0%
out and if you don't have copies we need
 
06:46:58.230 --> 06:46:58.240 align:start position:0%
to be asking the department to get us
 
06:47:00.230 --> 06:47:00.240 align:start position:0%
copies because the my last set of rules
 
06:47:03.750 --> 06:47:03.760 align:start position:0%
were based luckily right around 2015 16
 
06:47:05.430 --> 06:47:05.440 align:start position:0%
somewhere here
 
06:47:05.440 --> 06:47:06.310 align:start position:0%
somewhere here
um

06:47:06.310 --> 06:47:06.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:47:08.548 --> 06:47:08.558 align:start position:0%
probably 2014-15
 
06:47:10.628 --> 06:47:10.638 align:start position:0%
and uh but i
 
06:47:12.948 --> 06:47:12.958 align:start position:0%
i think that we're in a moment in our in
 
06:47:12.958 --> 06:47:13.750 align:start position:0%
i think that we're in a moment in our in
our

06:47:13.750 --> 06:47:13.760 align:start position:0%
our
 
06:47:16.628 --> 06:47:16.638 align:start position:0%
experience of education here a time
 
06:47:19.030 --> 06:47:19.040 align:start position:0%
when we we have to
 
06:47:19.040 --> 06:47:20.150 align:start position:0%
when we we have to
um

06:47:20.150 --> 06:47:20.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:47:21.990 --> 06:47:22.000 align:start position:0%
get rid of the walls
 
06:47:24.628 --> 06:47:24.638 align:start position:0%
um it's also i have a meeting coming up
 
06:47:27.590 --> 06:47:27.600 align:start position:0%
in two days of plymouth state university
 
06:47:29.830 --> 06:47:29.840 align:start position:0%
working with president
 
06:47:31.110 --> 06:47:31.120 align:start position:0%
don burks
 
06:47:33.590 --> 06:47:33.600 align:start position:0%
and he's now stated if you come out of
 
06:47:36.788 --> 06:47:36.798 align:start position:0%
that school with an associate degree
 
06:47:39.190 --> 06:47:39.200 align:start position:0%
and you go to plymouth state
 
06:47:40.628 --> 06:47:40.638 align:start position:0%
out of white mountain community college
 
06:47:42.468 --> 06:47:42.478 align:start position:0%
and you go to plymouth state you will
 
06:47:45.750 --> 06:47:45.760 align:start position:0%
come in as a junior
 
06:47:47.990 --> 06:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
that's very important now it's not going
 
06:47:50.628 --> 06:47:50.638 align:start position:0%
to be questioning what you had
 
06:47:53.190 --> 06:47:53.200 align:start position:0%
previously it's automatically going to
 
06:47:55.910 --> 06:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
be approved you are a junior i think
 
06:47:57.910 --> 06:47:57.920 align:start position:0%
that when we come in from another place
 
06:47:59.350 --> 06:47:59.360 align:start position:0%
where you're either having coming from a
 
06:47:59.360 --> 06:48:00.310 align:start position:0%
where you're either having coming from a
school

06:48:00.310 --> 06:48:00.320 align:start position:0%
school
 
06:48:02.230 --> 06:48:02.240 align:start position:0%
that's uh accredited through the new
 
06:48:03.750 --> 06:48:03.760 align:start position:0%
england association
 
06:48:07.830 --> 06:48:07.840 align:start position:0%
um or netchie and and you uh
 
06:48:09.190 --> 06:48:09.200 align:start position:0%
or you're
 
06:48:10.628 --> 06:48:10.638 align:start position:0%
and definitely you're coming from an
 
06:48:12.868 --> 06:48:12.878 align:start position:0%
approved program of our states that our
 
06:48:14.948 --> 06:48:14.958 align:start position:0%
state board has approved that's the key
 
06:48:16.390 --> 06:48:16.400 align:start position:0%
right there
 
06:48:16.400 --> 06:48:17.270 align:start position:0%
right there
then

06:48:17.270 --> 06:48:17.280 align:start position:0%
then
 
06:48:19.030 --> 06:48:19.040 align:start position:0%
then the credits awarded would be in
 
06:48:21.350 --> 06:48:21.360 align:start position:0%
conjunction with 306 and working with
 
06:48:23.110 --> 06:48:23.120 align:start position:0%
that district and finding okay are you
 
06:48:24.868 --> 06:48:24.878 align:start position:0%
giving a half credit for this a full
 
06:48:26.150 --> 06:48:26.160 align:start position:0%
credit quarter credit as you've
 
06:48:28.548 --> 06:48:28.558 align:start position:0%
mentioned that that has to be discerned
 
06:48:30.070 --> 06:48:30.080 align:start position:0%
and it should be understood
 
06:48:32.548 --> 06:48:32.558 align:start position:0%
what they receive
 
06:48:34.070 --> 06:48:34.080 align:start position:0%
in that school district should be what
 
06:48:36.310 --> 06:48:36.320 align:start position:0%
they receive elsewhere for it i believe
 
06:48:37.990 --> 06:48:38.000 align:start position:0%
but i'm not the person making that
 
06:48:38.000 --> 06:48:39.110 align:start position:0%
but i'm not the person making that
decision

06:48:39.110 --> 06:48:39.120 align:start position:0%
decision
 
06:48:41.590 --> 06:48:41.600 align:start position:0%
i'm just echoing what i understand to be
 
06:48:43.910 --> 06:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
in rule right now and done by the board
 
06:48:45.350 --> 06:48:45.360 align:start position:0%
state board
 
06:48:48.150 --> 06:48:48.160 align:start position:0%
hopefully i'll get the rules
 
06:48:51.030 --> 06:48:51.040 align:start position:0%
uh thank you um the rules are all on the
 
06:48:53.350 --> 06:48:53.360 align:start position:0%
d.o.e website also
 
06:48:53.360 --> 06:48:54.468 align:start position:0%
d.o.e website also
um

06:48:54.468 --> 06:48:54.478 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:48:55.990 --> 06:48:56.000 align:start position:0%
representative ellison
 
06:48:58.310 --> 06:48:58.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you thank
 
06:49:00.390 --> 06:49:00.400 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question i should know
 
06:49:01.830 --> 06:49:01.840 align:start position:0%
the answer to this
 
06:49:03.350 --> 06:49:03.360 align:start position:0%
uh but
 
06:49:06.390 --> 06:49:06.400 align:start position:0%
what is your take on the process
 
06:49:08.948 --> 06:49:08.958 align:start position:0%
that the department now uses
 
06:49:11.990 --> 06:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
to approve alternative programs is there
 
06:49:14.070 --> 06:49:14.080 align:start position:0%
is that laid out in the rules at this
 
06:49:16.310 --> 06:49:16.320 align:start position:0%
point i mean can we
 
06:49:18.708 --> 06:49:18.718 align:start position:0%
figure that one out as to
 
06:49:20.708 --> 06:49:20.718 align:start position:0%
you do this you apply you you know
 
06:49:23.350 --> 06:49:23.360 align:start position:0%
there's a group that passes judgment on
 
06:49:25.990 --> 06:49:26.000 align:start position:0%
these programs and says yes to this one
 
06:49:29.190 --> 06:49:29.200 align:start position:0%
yes to this one no to that one or
 
06:49:31.430 --> 06:49:31.440 align:start position:0%
well represent ellison
 
06:49:33.030 --> 06:49:33.040 align:start position:0%
i don't think i'm the person to give you
 
06:49:34.468 --> 06:49:34.478 align:start position:0%
the answer in that i think you're going
 
06:49:37.430 --> 06:49:37.440 align:start position:0%
to have to that's a good question
 
06:49:39.510 --> 06:49:39.520 align:start position:0%
i'm not familiar with process that they
 
06:49:41.830 --> 06:49:41.840 align:start position:0%
go through with uh
 
06:49:43.590 --> 06:49:43.600 align:start position:0%
it might be something to be asking
 
06:49:45.190 --> 06:49:45.200 align:start position:0%
directly of the department through the
 
06:49:46.948 --> 06:49:46.958 align:start position:0%
folks that are here maybe or it's true
 
06:49:48.310 --> 06:49:48.320 align:start position:0%
directly to
 
06:49:51.190 --> 06:49:51.200 align:start position:0%
drew klein who chairs the state board
 
06:49:51.200 --> 06:49:52.070 align:start position:0%
drew klein who chairs the state board
okay

06:49:52.070 --> 06:49:52.080 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:49:54.230 --> 06:49:54.240 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome uh if
 
06:49:57.270 --> 06:49:57.280 align:start position:0%
if i could just interject i i've talked
 
06:50:00.150 --> 06:50:00.160 align:start position:0%
for several years about the civil air
 
06:50:02.948 --> 06:50:02.958 align:start position:0%
patrol as being a prime candidate for
 
06:50:04.548 --> 06:50:04.558 align:start position:0%
learn everywhere
 
06:50:07.350 --> 06:50:07.360 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately i was not able to move
 
06:50:09.750 --> 06:50:09.760 align:start position:0%
that forward i turned it over to the
 
06:50:12.070 --> 06:50:12.080 align:start position:0%
cadet of the excuse me the major in
 
06:50:14.310 --> 06:50:14.320 align:start position:0%
charge of the legislative squadron who
 
06:50:17.670 --> 06:50:17.680 align:start position:0%
is moving that forward and i sent to him
 
06:50:20.628 --> 06:50:20.638 align:start position:0%
the there's a complicated application um
 
06:50:23.430 --> 06:50:23.440 align:start position:0%
you have to supply uh the curriculum
 
06:50:26.390 --> 06:50:26.400 align:start position:0%
basically that's involved and so they
 
06:50:28.468 --> 06:50:28.478 align:start position:0%
are now moving forward with having civil
 
06:50:32.390 --> 06:50:32.400 align:start position:0%
air patrol uh programs um accredited
 
06:50:34.868 --> 06:50:34.878 align:start position:0%
through the learn everywhere process uh
 
06:50:34.878 --> 06:50:35.670 align:start position:0%
through the learn everywhere process uh
for

06:50:35.670 --> 06:50:35.680 align:start position:0%
for
 
06:50:35.680 --> 06:50:36.548 align:start position:0%
for
um

06:50:36.548 --> 06:50:36.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:50:39.510 --> 06:50:39.520 align:start position:0%
uh civil air patrol cadets uh to gain
 
06:50:39.520 --> 06:50:40.708 align:start position:0%
uh civil air patrol cadets uh to gain
credits

06:50:40.708 --> 06:50:40.718 align:start position:0%
credits
 
06:50:43.750 --> 06:50:43.760 align:start position:0%
could i ask could i ask you a question
 
06:50:47.430 --> 06:50:47.440 align:start position:0%
well sure i i i i i i can't see
 
06:50:50.468 --> 06:50:50.478 align:start position:0%
no no i'm sorry this is relates to
 
06:50:53.750 --> 06:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
representatives cordelia's uh point i
 
06:50:55.510 --> 06:50:55.520 align:start position:0%
i'm assuming there's a process then
 
06:50:58.070 --> 06:50:58.080 align:start position:0%
there's a format they fill it out i'm
 
06:50:59.830 --> 06:50:59.840 align:start position:0%
assuming there's a list of approved
 
06:51:02.390 --> 06:51:02.400 align:start position:0%
programs somewhere that the department
 
06:51:04.310 --> 06:51:04.320 align:start position:0%
published either
 
06:51:06.788 --> 06:51:06.798 align:start position:0%
the air cadets are on it or they're not
 
06:51:09.190 --> 06:51:09.200 align:start position:0%
but that there's a list of approved
 
06:51:11.190 --> 06:51:11.200 align:start position:0%
alternative programs but that may be
 
06:51:13.350 --> 06:51:13.360 align:start position:0%
assumption another assumption i'm making
 
06:51:15.350 --> 06:51:15.360 align:start position:0%
that's not true
 
06:51:16.868 --> 06:51:16.878 align:start position:0%
i i believe there is a list on the
 
06:51:19.830 --> 06:51:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:21.670 --> 06:51:21.680 align:start position:0%
um for any further questions for the
 
06:51:27.670 --> 06:51:27.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:45.190 --> 06:51:45.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:01.430 --> 06:52:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:05.030 --> 06:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:07.030 --> 06:52:07.040 align:start position:0%
organizations which deal with concurrent
 
06:52:08.628 --> 06:52:08.638 align:start position:0%
dual enrollment we dealt with that and
 
06:52:10.070 --> 06:52:10.080 align:start position:0%
would there are certain standards which
 
06:52:11.750 --> 06:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
but i'm unfamiliar with what you're
 
06:52:13.190 --> 06:52:13.200 align:start position:0%
speaking of i
 
06:52:16.548 --> 06:52:16.558 align:start position:0%
i've had classes in spanish and latin
 
06:52:18.708 --> 06:52:18.718 align:start position:0%
vietnamese i wish there was something
 
06:52:20.070 --> 06:52:20.080 align:start position:0%
that you're suggesting because i can't
 
06:52:21.910 --> 06:52:21.920 align:start position:0%
speak a word in any of them
 
06:52:21.920 --> 06:52:22.708 align:start position:0%
speak a word in any of them
um

06:52:22.708 --> 06:52:22.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:52:24.468 --> 06:52:24.478 align:start position:0%
so it was actually you know something
 
06:52:26.310 --> 06:52:26.320 align:start position:0%
which was really not benefiting me well
 
06:52:28.070 --> 06:52:28.080 align:start position:0%
vietnamese did i i still have a lot of
 
06:52:33.030 --> 06:52:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:34.628 --> 06:52:34.638 align:start position:0%
excuse me representative
 
06:52:36.468 --> 06:52:36.478 align:start position:0%
if i could um ask you to turn your mic
 
06:52:38.150 --> 06:52:38.160 align:start position:0%
on thank you thank you i
 
06:52:39.910 --> 06:52:39.920 align:start position:0%
keep forgetting that thing
 
06:52:39.920 --> 06:52:41.270 align:start position:0%
keep forgetting that thing
um

06:52:41.270 --> 06:52:41.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:52:43.350 --> 06:52:43.360 align:start position:0%
it is a process that many universities
 
06:52:45.990 --> 06:52:46.000 align:start position:0%
use it allows them not to have to offer
 
06:52:48.788 --> 06:52:48.798 align:start position:0%
courses in say swahili which they would
 
06:52:50.788 --> 06:52:50.798 align:start position:0%
have a limited enrollment in and
 
06:52:53.350 --> 06:52:53.360 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be viable economically but the
 
06:52:55.750 --> 06:52:55.760 align:start position:0%
person can then establish their through
 
06:52:57.590 --> 06:52:57.600 align:start position:0%
their their competence in the language
 
06:52:59.750 --> 06:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
and level of confidence and therefore
 
06:53:02.468 --> 06:53:02.478 align:start position:0%
they can be awarded credit and these are
 
06:53:03.510 --> 06:53:03.520 align:start position:0%
it's a very
 
06:53:06.390 --> 06:53:06.400 align:start position:0%
valid process
 
06:53:08.708 --> 06:53:08.718 align:start position:0%
the only thing i i've touched with that
 
06:53:11.830 --> 06:53:11.840 align:start position:0%
as as a father when my
 
06:53:13.510 --> 06:53:13.520 align:start position:0%
daughter who's now the speech therapist
 
06:53:17.190 --> 06:53:17.200 align:start position:0%
audiologist was in high school and the
 
06:53:18.948 --> 06:53:18.958 align:start position:0%
literature that she needed wasn't being
 
06:53:21.990 --> 06:53:22.000 align:start position:0%
taught there in alaska and she took us
 
06:53:23.590 --> 06:53:23.600 align:start position:0%
course through the university of kansas
 
06:53:25.510 --> 06:53:25.520 align:start position:0%
for high school kids which was
 
06:53:27.510 --> 06:53:27.520 align:start position:0%
immediately accepted
 
06:53:29.190 --> 06:53:29.200 align:start position:0%
but that's a little bit different what
 
06:53:30.868 --> 06:53:30.878 align:start position:0%
you're talking about it's it's different
 
06:53:32.948 --> 06:53:32.958 align:start position:0%
but it's still competency-based yes it
 
06:53:35.430 --> 06:53:35.440 align:start position:0%
was when the assessment is made it's
 
06:53:37.670 --> 06:53:37.680 align:start position:0%
made on the basis of competence and it
 
06:53:38.868 --> 06:53:38.878 align:start position:0%
was also
 
06:53:41.910 --> 06:53:41.920 align:start position:0%
when she was admitted into elmira
 
06:53:44.468 --> 06:53:44.478 align:start position:0%
uh she was given a competency test to
 
06:53:45.910 --> 06:53:45.920 align:start position:0%
find out where she would be placed
 
06:53:47.990 --> 06:53:48.000 align:start position:0%
within that program and she did quite
 
06:53:49.430 --> 06:53:49.440 align:start position:0%
well with that so
 
06:53:51.670 --> 06:53:51.680 align:start position:0%
um competency's been around a long time
 
06:53:52.868 --> 06:53:52.878 align:start position:0%
and that's the way we should be
 
06:53:52.878 --> 06:53:53.910 align:start position:0%
and that's the way we should be
measuring

06:53:53.910 --> 06:53:53.920 align:start position:0%
measuring
 
06:53:57.030 --> 06:53:57.040 align:start position:0%
uh the competencies uh whether they get
 
06:53:59.910 --> 06:53:59.920 align:start position:0%
uh credit for a course or not
 
06:54:02.070 --> 06:54:02.080 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome any
 
06:54:04.468 --> 06:54:04.478 align:start position:0%
yes representative cornell
 
06:54:06.070 --> 06:54:06.080 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
06:54:07.990 --> 06:54:08.000 align:start position:0%
question i totally agree with you about
 
06:54:10.868 --> 06:54:10.878 align:start position:0%
the cte competencies i'm on that
 
06:54:14.070 --> 06:54:14.080 align:start position:0%
cte advisory council and manchester
 
06:54:15.990 --> 06:54:16.000 align:start position:0%
school of technology is all competency
 
06:54:17.510 --> 06:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
based so
 
06:54:19.270 --> 06:54:19.280 align:start position:0%
it works but
 
06:54:21.430 --> 06:54:21.440 align:start position:0%
what last year when we were discussing
 
06:54:24.230 --> 06:54:24.240 align:start position:0%
high schools not accepting velax
 
06:54:26.468 --> 06:54:26.478 align:start position:0%
i called velex and they said the only
 
06:54:29.990 --> 06:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
time they ever had a problem was when
 
06:54:31.510 --> 06:54:31.520 align:start position:0%
the parent or
 
06:54:33.670 --> 06:54:33.680 align:start position:0%
what student wanted the high school to
 
06:54:33.680 --> 06:54:34.708 align:start position:0%
what student wanted the high school to
accept

06:54:34.708 --> 06:54:34.718 align:start position:0%
accept
 
06:54:36.548 --> 06:54:36.558 align:start position:0%
an outside course
 
06:54:39.030 --> 06:54:39.040 align:start position:0%
for a required course and it was an
 
06:54:39.040 --> 06:54:40.868 align:start position:0%
for a required course and it was an
elective

06:54:40.868 --> 06:54:40.878 align:start position:0%
elective
 
06:54:40.878 --> 06:54:42.708 align:start position:0%
elective
so

06:54:42.708 --> 06:54:42.718 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:54:45.030 --> 06:54:45.040 align:start position:0%
you're saying maybe granted for
 
06:54:47.350 --> 06:54:47.360 align:start position:0%
coursework michelle accept credits for
 
06:54:49.110 --> 06:54:49.120 align:start position:0%
high school graduation
 
06:54:51.510 --> 06:54:51.520 align:start position:0%
but what if they're wanting it to go
 
06:54:51.520 --> 06:54:52.628 align:start position:0%
but what if they're wanting it to go
toward

06:54:52.628 --> 06:54:52.638 align:start position:0%
toward
 
06:54:55.110 --> 06:54:55.120 align:start position:0%
a requirement for graduation but the
 
06:54:57.430 --> 06:54:57.440 align:start position:0%
class the outside coursework really
 
06:54:57.440 --> 06:54:58.390 align:start position:0%
class the outside coursework really
wasn't

06:54:58.390 --> 06:54:58.400 align:start position:0%
wasn't
 
06:54:59.910 --> 06:54:59.920 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh representative
 
06:55:03.510 --> 06:55:03.520 align:start position:0%
cornell you've hit why we are
 
06:55:05.590 --> 06:55:05.600 align:start position:0%
putting the language in the cte
 
06:55:07.910 --> 06:55:07.920 align:start position:0%
because it's usually in your freshman
 
06:55:07.920 --> 06:55:08.708 align:start position:0%
because it's usually in your freshman
year

06:55:08.708 --> 06:55:08.718 align:start position:0%
year
 
06:55:10.468 --> 06:55:10.478 align:start position:0%
sophomore year you're still taking some
 
06:55:12.788 --> 06:55:12.798 align:start position:0%
of those required courses
 
06:55:14.310 --> 06:55:14.320 align:start position:0%
and those
 
06:55:16.948 --> 06:55:16.958 align:start position:0%
course that type of uh course
 
06:55:18.788 --> 06:55:18.798 align:start position:0%
is preventing
 
06:55:21.350 --> 06:55:21.360 align:start position:0%
a student because now we lower the level
 
06:55:25.030 --> 06:55:25.040 align:start position:0%
for gray for our ctes to 10th grade
 
06:55:26.548 --> 06:55:26.558 align:start position:0%
from going in their 10th grade and
 
06:55:28.070 --> 06:55:28.080 align:start position:0%
getting involved with the program that
 
06:55:29.350 --> 06:55:29.360 align:start position:0%
they really should be there and they
 
06:55:30.708 --> 06:55:30.718 align:start position:0%
could get the competency for that
 
06:55:33.030 --> 06:55:33.040 align:start position:0%
requirement so the
 
06:55:35.990 --> 06:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
in in that case the course the
 
06:55:38.868 --> 06:55:38.878 align:start position:0%
competencies acquired at the ct
 
06:55:41.110 --> 06:55:41.120 align:start position:0%
will not come back and count as an
 
06:55:43.030 --> 06:55:43.040 align:start position:0%
elective they will count as that
 
06:55:45.590 --> 06:55:45.600 align:start position:0%
required course that they
 
06:55:47.510 --> 06:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
were able to take over there this is the
 
06:55:49.590 --> 06:55:49.600 align:start position:0%
way i see this program as well
 
06:55:51.510 --> 06:55:51.520 align:start position:0%
but i i'm i'm not concerned about the
 
06:55:53.430 --> 06:55:53.440 align:start position:0%
ctes because i know that they're being
 
06:55:55.830 --> 06:55:55.840 align:start position:0%
done in school but i'm saying an outside
 
06:55:57.910 --> 06:55:57.920 align:start position:0%
learn everywhere course
 
06:56:00.788 --> 06:56:00.798 align:start position:0%
that's been approved that could be
 
06:56:03.030 --> 06:56:03.040 align:start position:0%
skiing that they want to bring back to
 
06:56:05.510 --> 06:56:05.520 align:start position:0%
the school and have it count as their
 
06:56:07.910 --> 06:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
science class because they were outside
 
06:56:10.150 --> 06:56:10.160 align:start position:0%
and getting that that would not occur in
 
06:56:12.390 --> 06:56:12.400 align:start position:0%
this program right because there's
 
06:56:14.150 --> 06:56:14.160 align:start position:0%
you can't just go off and take a course
 
06:56:16.548 --> 06:56:16.558 align:start position:0%
in something just to have a course it's
 
06:56:18.708 --> 06:56:18.718 align:start position:0%
not like recertification where you take
 
06:56:20.548 --> 06:56:20.558 align:start position:0%
your up to your five or six credits
 
06:56:21.670 --> 06:56:21.680 align:start position:0%
whatever you have to and it can be
 
06:56:22.948 --> 06:56:22.958 align:start position:0%
anything in your field that's a wide
 
06:56:25.590 --> 06:56:25.600 align:start position:0%
open game this is not wide open if you
 
06:56:27.590 --> 06:56:27.600 align:start position:0%
look at education 306 it's going to
 
06:56:29.190 --> 06:56:29.200 align:start position:0%
specifically state
 
06:56:31.270 --> 06:56:31.280 align:start position:0%
the subject area the subject learning
 
06:56:33.510 --> 06:56:33.520 align:start position:0%
domains that these uh credits are
 
06:56:35.350 --> 06:56:35.360 align:start position:0%
offered in
 
06:56:36.548 --> 06:56:36.558 align:start position:0%
course taken
 
06:56:36.558 --> 06:56:37.270 align:start position:0%
course taken
yes

06:56:37.270 --> 06:56:37.280 align:start position:0%
yes
 
06:56:39.510 --> 06:56:39.520 align:start position:0%
the local school district can say no
 
06:56:41.350 --> 06:56:41.360 align:start position:0%
then to that
 
06:56:43.430 --> 06:56:43.440 align:start position:0%
if they i would imagine they could say
 
06:56:45.110 --> 06:56:45.120 align:start position:0%
no if they're if
 
06:56:46.948 --> 06:56:46.958 align:start position:0%
if the student through the state board
 
06:56:48.948 --> 06:56:48.958 align:start position:0%
is trying to carry in a course which is
 
06:56:51.910 --> 06:56:51.920 align:start position:0%
on basket weaving and they need this in
 
06:56:55.110 --> 06:56:55.120 align:start position:0%
literature okay thank you you're welcome
 
06:56:56.230 --> 06:56:56.240 align:start position:0%
any further
 
06:56:57.830 --> 06:56:57.840 align:start position:0%
yes i guess there are representative
 
06:57:00.230 --> 06:57:00.240 align:start position:0%
mullen thank you mr chair and thank you
 
06:57:01.990 --> 06:57:02.000 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
06:57:04.708 --> 06:57:04.718 align:start position:0%
you referenced representative uh the
 
06:57:08.230 --> 06:57:08.240 align:start position:0%
example of a student taking a college
 
06:57:10.788 --> 06:57:10.798 align:start position:0%
class at the university of kansas or
 
06:57:11.990 --> 06:57:12.000 align:start position:0%
whatever and
 
06:57:14.628 --> 06:57:14.638 align:start position:0%
transferring it in
 
06:57:17.750 --> 06:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
generally speaking in college situations
 
06:57:20.788 --> 06:57:20.798 align:start position:0%
there's a limit to the amount of credits
 
06:57:22.070 --> 06:57:22.080 align:start position:0%
that one
 
06:57:24.948 --> 06:57:24.958 align:start position:0%
university will allow transferred in
 
06:57:27.110 --> 06:57:27.120 align:start position:0%
from another university
 
06:57:30.628 --> 06:57:30.638 align:start position:0%
um is there anything in this bill that
 
06:57:30.638 --> 06:57:31.990 align:start position:0%
um is there anything in this bill that
would

06:57:31.990 --> 06:57:32.000 align:start position:0%
would
 
06:57:35.510 --> 06:57:35.520 align:start position:0%
somehow temper whether or not somebody
 
06:57:35.520 --> 06:57:37.110 align:start position:0%
somehow temper whether or not somebody
took

06:57:37.110 --> 06:57:37.120 align:start position:0%
took
 
06:57:40.150 --> 06:57:40.160 align:start position:0%
every course but one
 
06:57:43.030 --> 06:57:43.040 align:start position:0%
in an alternative program and then
 
06:57:45.990 --> 06:57:46.000 align:start position:0%
came in and wanted it applied towards a
 
06:57:48.070 --> 06:57:48.080 align:start position:0%
local high school diploma i don't think
 
06:57:51.190 --> 06:57:51.200 align:start position:0%
there's anything to temper that uh i i
 
06:57:52.628 --> 06:57:52.638 align:start position:0%
can't imagine somebody doing it but
 
06:57:55.190 --> 06:57:55.200 align:start position:0%
that's possible uh and by the way the
 
06:57:56.708 --> 06:57:56.718 align:start position:0%
the course which we took at the
 
06:57:58.390 --> 06:57:58.400 align:start position:0%
university of kansas it was not a
 
06:58:00.548 --> 06:58:00.558 align:start position:0%
college they had a correspondent school
 
06:58:02.948 --> 06:58:02.958 align:start position:0%
attached to the university so they were
 
06:58:05.670 --> 06:58:05.680 align:start position:0%
offering high school level courses
 
06:58:08.548 --> 06:58:08.558 align:start position:0%
through that university in kansas
 
06:58:10.868 --> 06:58:10.878 align:start position:0%
uh that was done in alaska often times
 
06:58:12.390 --> 06:58:12.400 align:start position:0%
seeing that you're often in a small
 
06:58:13.910 --> 06:58:13.920 align:start position:0%
community where you didn't have these
 
06:58:15.510 --> 06:58:15.520 align:start position:0%
offerings and so they went on the
 
06:58:17.590 --> 06:58:17.600 align:start position:0%
correspondence type study and that's how
 
06:58:19.110 --> 06:58:19.120 align:start position:0%
they they did it there those are
 
06:58:20.788 --> 06:58:20.798 align:start position:0%
automatically accepted could i have a
 
06:58:22.868 --> 06:58:22.878 align:start position:0%
follow-up representative you may thank
 
06:58:24.628 --> 06:58:24.638 align:start position:0%
you um
 
06:58:28.070 --> 06:58:28.080 align:start position:0%
so here's here's my question i
 
06:58:30.468 --> 06:58:30.478 align:start position:0%
personally as a representative
 
06:58:34.310 --> 06:58:34.320 align:start position:0%
have had feedback from local folk
 
06:58:36.788 --> 06:58:36.798 align:start position:0%
who are not happy with what they're
 
06:58:40.948 --> 06:58:40.958 align:start position:0%
describing as local control which is a
 
06:58:42.708 --> 06:58:42.718 align:start position:0%
big deal in the state of new hampshire
 
06:58:44.548 --> 06:58:44.558 align:start position:0%
as you well know
 
06:58:46.230 --> 06:58:46.240 align:start position:0%
being taken away
 
06:58:48.230 --> 06:58:48.240 align:start position:0%
with regards to
 
06:58:51.270 --> 06:58:51.280 align:start position:0%
our high school and school board working
 
06:58:53.510 --> 06:58:53.520 align:start position:0%
to determine blah blah blah how you know
 
06:58:56.150 --> 06:58:56.160 align:start position:0%
what should be part of the diploma
 
06:58:56.160 --> 06:58:58.150 align:start position:0%
what should be part of the diploma
situation

06:58:58.150 --> 06:58:58.160 align:start position:0%
situation
 
06:59:00.708 --> 06:59:00.718 align:start position:0%
so my question to you is do you not get
 
06:59:03.590 --> 06:59:03.600 align:start position:0%
any of that feedback and if you do how
 
06:59:03.600 --> 06:59:04.948 align:start position:0%
any of that feedback and if you do how
do

06:59:04.948 --> 06:59:04.958 align:start position:0%
do
 
06:59:07.270 --> 06:59:07.280 align:start position:0%
i how do you manage it represent mullen
 
06:59:09.430 --> 06:59:09.440 align:start position:0%
i've not had that feedback i the the
 
06:59:11.270 --> 06:59:11.280 align:start position:0%
folks i've talked to primarily are ones
 
06:59:12.150 --> 06:59:12.160 align:start position:0%
where the
 
06:59:14.150 --> 06:59:14.160 align:start position:0%
the the student has
 
06:59:16.390 --> 06:59:16.400 align:start position:0%
come in from another location
 
06:59:19.270 --> 06:59:19.280 align:start position:0%
the school would not accept that course
 
06:59:21.830 --> 06:59:21.840 align:start position:0%
and they're out of step out of sync with
 
06:59:23.590 --> 06:59:23.600 align:start position:0%
the rest of students at that grade level
 
06:59:25.190 --> 06:59:25.200 align:start position:0%
they're in and they took this course and
 
06:59:27.110 --> 06:59:27.120 align:start position:0%
it counted towards the credit that they
 
06:59:29.590 --> 06:59:29.600 align:start position:0%
evidently were not giving
 
06:59:32.150 --> 06:59:32.160 align:start position:0%
credit for um
 
06:59:36.150 --> 06:59:36.160 align:start position:0%
i i i'm not familiar with where i'm not
 
06:59:37.830 --> 06:59:37.840 align:start position:0%
getting that type of feedback from
 
06:59:39.510 --> 06:59:39.520 align:start position:0%
community where i am
 
06:59:45.590 --> 06:59:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:59:49.590 --> 06:59:49.600 align:start position:0%
uh representative tanner i know i well i
 
06:59:52.230 --> 06:59:52.240 align:start position:0%
draw the line right across the state
 
06:59:52.240 --> 06:59:52.948 align:start position:0%
draw the line right across the state
so

06:59:52.948 --> 06:59:52.958 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:59:54.468 --> 06:59:54.478 align:start position:0%
two states in this state i'm west of
 
06:59:56.070 --> 06:59:56.080 align:start position:0%
concord okay
 
06:59:56.080 --> 06:59:56.948 align:start position:0%
concord okay
um

06:59:56.948 --> 06:59:56.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:59:59.030 --> 06:59:59.040 align:start position:0%
just following up on what representative
 
07:00:02.390 --> 07:00:02.400 align:start position:0%
ford said about people uh you know
 
07:00:05.190 --> 07:00:05.200 align:start position:0%
having the ability to do something like
 
07:00:07.590 --> 07:00:07.600 align:start position:0%
like speak swahili or they're coming
 
07:00:09.750 --> 07:00:09.760 align:start position:0%
from another another place
 
07:00:12.070 --> 07:00:12.080 align:start position:0%
and they have the competency but the
 
07:00:12.080 --> 07:00:13.270 align:start position:0%
and they have the competency but the
local

07:00:13.270 --> 07:00:13.280 align:start position:0%
local
 
07:00:15.590 --> 07:00:15.600 align:start position:0%
university or local school that accepts
 
07:00:16.868 --> 07:00:16.878 align:start position:0%
that person
 
07:00:18.948 --> 07:00:18.958 align:start position:0%
actually tests them to see what grade
 
07:00:22.310 --> 07:00:22.320 align:start position:0%
they belong in or or ask them to
 
07:00:25.110 --> 07:00:25.120 align:start position:0%
show their competency so that they can
 
07:00:27.270 --> 07:00:27.280 align:start position:0%
uh meet the standards of that particular
 
07:00:29.030 --> 07:00:29.040 align:start position:0%
school i'm just
 
07:00:30.868 --> 07:00:30.878 align:start position:0%
you know that's that's kind of where i'm
 
07:00:32.628 --> 07:00:32.638 align:start position:0%
coming from that
 
07:00:33.910 --> 07:00:33.920 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
07:00:36.230 --> 07:00:36.240 align:start position:0%
and i'm i'm not sure do you think that
 
07:00:38.868 --> 07:00:38.878 align:start position:0%
that that happens that the if the state
 
07:00:40.628 --> 07:00:40.638 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire the department of
 
07:00:42.150 --> 07:00:42.160 align:start position:0%
education says
 
07:00:44.708 --> 07:00:44.718 align:start position:0%
you know uh johnny jones completed this
 
07:00:44.718 --> 07:00:46.150 align:start position:0%
you know uh johnny jones completed this
course

07:00:46.150 --> 07:00:46.160 align:start position:0%
course
 
07:00:49.990 --> 07:00:50.000 align:start position:0%
uh give him one credit in english and um
 
07:00:52.150 --> 07:00:52.160 align:start position:0%
the local school district says
 
07:00:54.310 --> 07:00:54.320 align:start position:0%
you know this is what we do in
 
07:00:56.150 --> 07:00:56.160 align:start position:0%
that particular english class these are
 
07:00:58.788 --> 07:00:58.798 align:start position:0%
the competencies that we've set up for
 
07:01:00.788 --> 07:01:00.798 align:start position:0%
uh that required course
 
07:01:02.948 --> 07:01:02.958 align:start position:0%
um are you willing to demonstrate that
 
07:01:04.868 --> 07:01:04.878 align:start position:0%
competency here we'll give you credit
 
07:01:07.510 --> 07:01:07.520 align:start position:0%
for it i i just can respond to that i
 
07:01:09.430 --> 07:01:09.440 align:start position:0%
think that there should be communication
 
07:01:11.430 --> 07:01:11.440 align:start position:0%
between the department that does that
 
07:01:13.350 --> 07:01:13.360 align:start position:0%
and and the school district they can
 
07:01:15.270 --> 07:01:15.280 align:start position:0%
discuss this there might be some other
 
07:01:17.030 --> 07:01:17.040 align:start position:0%
issues that are not being coming to the
 
07:01:17.040 --> 07:01:18.310 align:start position:0%
issues that are not being coming to the
surface

07:01:18.310 --> 07:01:18.320 align:start position:0%
surface
 
07:01:19.430 --> 07:01:19.440 align:start position:0%
that's why
 
07:01:21.270 --> 07:01:21.280 align:start position:0%
in the other program i spoke to we call
 
07:01:23.910 --> 07:01:23.920 align:start position:0%
it the rctea there are regional
 
07:01:23.920 --> 07:01:25.590 align:start position:0%
it the rctea there are regional
agreements

07:01:25.590 --> 07:01:25.600 align:start position:0%
agreements
 
07:01:27.110 --> 07:01:27.120 align:start position:0%
and the agreements are between the
 
07:01:29.110 --> 07:01:29.120 align:start position:0%
sending and receiving schools some of
 
07:01:30.948 --> 07:01:30.958 align:start position:0%
those schools you know we have nine or
 
07:01:30.958 --> 07:01:32.468 align:start position:0%
those schools you know we have nine or
so

07:01:32.468 --> 07:01:32.478 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:01:35.030 --> 07:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
sending schools to one center and that
 
07:01:37.110 --> 07:01:37.120 align:start position:0%
creates some real huge problems in terms
 
07:01:39.590 --> 07:01:39.600 align:start position:0%
of scheduling for kids as well as
 
07:01:41.670 --> 07:01:41.680 align:start position:0%
getting the required courses necessary
 
07:01:43.270 --> 07:01:43.280 align:start position:0%
for graduation
 
07:01:44.948 --> 07:01:44.958 align:start position:0%
and we're learning that we have to
 
07:01:46.948 --> 07:01:46.958 align:start position:0%
communicate and work together on so many
 
07:01:49.750 --> 07:01:49.760 align:start position:0%
issues and aligning our curriculum and i
 
07:01:51.510 --> 07:01:51.520 align:start position:0%
realized that with a career in technical
 
07:01:54.230 --> 07:01:54.240 align:start position:0%
education and i i totally agree that the
 
07:01:55.670 --> 07:01:55.680 align:start position:0%
you know i know that the schools are
 
07:01:57.590 --> 07:01:57.600 align:start position:0%
working together just like um
 
07:01:59.430 --> 07:01:59.440 align:start position:0%
representative cornell said what i'm
 
07:02:02.070 --> 07:02:02.080 align:start position:0%
concerned about is the alternative
 
07:02:03.430 --> 07:02:03.440 align:start position:0%
credits where
 
07:02:05.750 --> 07:02:05.760 align:start position:0%
uh someone decides that
 
07:02:07.030 --> 07:02:07.040 align:start position:0%
like i said they're going to mow the
 
07:02:08.788 --> 07:02:08.798 align:start position:0%
lawn for grandma for a month and that
 
07:02:10.628 --> 07:02:10.638 align:start position:0%
should be their pe credit
 
07:02:10.638 --> 07:02:11.910 align:start position:0%
should be their pe credit
um

07:02:11.910 --> 07:02:11.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:02:13.750 --> 07:02:13.760 align:start position:0%
and they bring it to the school and the
 
07:02:15.590 --> 07:02:15.600 align:start position:0%
school says well you know this this is
 
07:02:17.670 --> 07:02:17.680 align:start position:0%
our requirement maybe it's maybe it's a
 
07:02:19.190 --> 07:02:19.200 align:start position:0%
fitness course or something that they
 
07:02:20.230 --> 07:02:20.240 align:start position:0%
have to do
 
07:02:23.270 --> 07:02:23.280 align:start position:0%
and um should the high school have that
 
07:02:25.830 --> 07:02:25.840 align:start position:0%
resp that ability in order to give them
 
07:02:27.910 --> 07:02:27.920 align:start position:0%
graduation credits or determine what
 
07:02:29.190 --> 07:02:29.200 align:start position:0%
level they're in whether they're in
 
07:02:31.670 --> 07:02:31.680 align:start position:0%
grade 10 or 11 english
 
07:02:34.070 --> 07:02:34.080 align:start position:0%
should they have that ability to to ask
 
07:02:36.390 --> 07:02:36.400 align:start position:0%
the person to the student to show
 
07:02:36.400 --> 07:02:38.230 align:start position:0%
the person to the student to show
competency

07:02:38.230 --> 07:02:38.240 align:start position:0%
competency
 
07:02:40.310 --> 07:02:40.320 align:start position:0%
to them i think that would be something
 
07:02:42.390 --> 07:02:42.400 align:start position:0%
that the department would have to find
 
07:02:42.400 --> 07:02:43.190 align:start position:0%
that the department would have to find
out

07:02:43.190 --> 07:02:43.200 align:start position:0%
out
 
07:02:45.190 --> 07:02:45.200 align:start position:0%
and determine that
 
07:02:47.430 --> 07:02:47.440 align:start position:0%
we have academic standards which are set
 
07:02:48.788 --> 07:02:48.798 align:start position:0%
by the state
 
07:02:50.948 --> 07:02:50.958 align:start position:0%
then we have competencies which are
 
07:02:52.548 --> 07:02:52.558 align:start position:0%
relative to what's going on in your
 
07:02:54.868 --> 07:02:54.878 align:start position:0%
curriculum in your district there has to
 
07:02:56.868 --> 07:02:56.878 align:start position:0%
be some kind of a relationship there or
 
07:02:59.910 --> 07:02:59.920 align:start position:0%
else competencies to measure
 
07:03:02.150 --> 07:03:02.160 align:start position:0%
those academic standards which we're
 
07:03:05.350 --> 07:03:05.360 align:start position:0%
leaping towards and so
 
07:03:07.270 --> 07:03:07.280 align:start position:0%
this will work
 
07:03:09.110 --> 07:03:09.120 align:start position:0%
we got to communicate and talk with each
 
07:03:09.120 --> 07:03:09.990 align:start position:0%
we got to communicate and talk with each
other

07:03:09.990 --> 07:03:10.000 align:start position:0%
other
 
07:03:14.230 --> 07:03:14.240 align:start position:0%
and and offer students this opportunity
 
07:03:16.230 --> 07:03:16.240 align:start position:0%
to move forward
 
07:03:18.788 --> 07:03:18.798 align:start position:0%
uh in a way that
 
07:03:21.910 --> 07:03:21.920 align:start position:0%
not just always best fits them but
 
07:03:21.920 --> 07:03:22.708 align:start position:0%
not just always best fits them but
uh

07:03:22.708 --> 07:03:22.718 align:start position:0%
uh
 
07:03:24.868 --> 07:03:24.878 align:start position:0%
helps them with their scheduling and
 
07:03:26.788 --> 07:03:26.798 align:start position:0%
achieving that goal as quickly as
 
07:03:28.468 --> 07:03:28.478 align:start position:0%
possible so they can move on in higher
 
07:03:28.478 --> 07:03:29.750 align:start position:0%
possible so they can move on in higher
education

07:03:29.750 --> 07:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
education
 
07:03:32.628 --> 07:03:32.638 align:start position:0%
thank you any further questions for yes
 
07:03:33.990 --> 07:03:34.000 align:start position:0%
uh representative
 
07:03:36.468 --> 07:03:36.478 align:start position:0%
uh president ford if you could first
 
07:03:39.990 --> 07:03:40.000 align:start position:0%
press the button and turn on your mic
 
07:03:41.990 --> 07:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
right exactly thank you you've got the
 
07:03:44.070 --> 07:03:44.080 align:start position:0%
routine now
 
07:03:46.468 --> 07:03:46.478 align:start position:0%
yeah don't be so sure you may have to
 
07:03:50.548 --> 07:03:50.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:03:52.310 --> 07:03:52.320 align:start position:0%
representative ladd i'm wondering if
 
07:03:54.150 --> 07:03:54.160 align:start position:0%
you're familiar with the practice of
 
07:03:57.110 --> 07:03:57.120 align:start position:0%
many universities when presented with
 
07:03:59.030 --> 07:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
courses for transfer
 
07:04:00.628 --> 07:04:00.638 align:start position:0%
and it's in the field we'll just say
 
07:04:03.270 --> 07:04:03.280 align:start position:0%
english because that's my field and the
 
07:04:05.750 --> 07:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
course doesn't exactly match to the
 
07:04:08.310 --> 07:04:08.320 align:start position:0%
address my colleagues concerned uh just
 
07:04:08.320 --> 07:04:09.270 align:start position:0%
address my colleagues concerned uh just
asked

07:04:09.270 --> 07:04:09.280 align:start position:0%
asked
 
07:04:12.310 --> 07:04:12.320 align:start position:0%
and but it meets the criteria for
 
07:04:15.430 --> 07:04:15.440 align:start position:0%
transfer so that the university can opt
 
07:04:18.468 --> 07:04:18.478 align:start position:0%
to give them credit in that discipline
 
07:04:20.788 --> 07:04:20.798 align:start position:0%
but not necessarily in fulfillment of
 
07:04:22.548 --> 07:04:22.558 align:start position:0%
that requirement
 
07:04:23.830 --> 07:04:23.840 align:start position:0%
and that some
 
07:04:26.310 --> 07:04:26.320 align:start position:0%
not uncommonly happens particularly if
 
07:04:28.310 --> 07:04:28.320 align:start position:0%
there's several courses involved or
 
07:04:31.030 --> 07:04:31.040 align:start position:0%
different things you may satisfy some
 
07:04:33.110 --> 07:04:33.120 align:start position:0%
companies and not i just wondered
 
07:04:34.468 --> 07:04:34.478 align:start position:0%
whether you were familiar with that well
 
07:04:36.628 --> 07:04:36.638 align:start position:0%
i can remember as a young officer in the
 
07:04:38.868 --> 07:04:38.878 align:start position:0%
service how we had we worked with the
 
07:04:40.628 --> 07:04:40.638 align:start position:0%
maryland university
 
07:04:42.230 --> 07:04:42.240 align:start position:0%
they were one of the first ones to start
 
07:04:43.910 --> 07:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
going in this direction
 
07:04:45.590 --> 07:04:45.600 align:start position:0%
and there are articulation agreements
 
07:04:47.430 --> 07:04:47.440 align:start position:0%
too between the military and in that
 
07:04:49.910 --> 07:04:49.920 align:start position:0%
university so that uh
 
07:04:51.990 --> 07:04:52.000 align:start position:0%
we could get credit for you know all
 
07:04:53.990 --> 07:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
that pt physical
 
07:04:55.510 --> 07:04:55.520 align:start position:0%
work we're going through and running
 
07:04:57.670 --> 07:04:57.680 align:start position:0%
around the track and all this other
 
07:05:00.390 --> 07:05:00.400 align:start position:0%
and um i think that proved to be very
 
07:05:02.310 --> 07:05:02.320 align:start position:0%
beneficial and helpful
 
07:05:04.708 --> 07:05:04.718 align:start position:0%
that those agreements were in place
 
07:05:07.190 --> 07:05:07.200 align:start position:0%
and um
 
07:05:08.708 --> 07:05:08.718 align:start position:0%
it saved a great deal of money for
 
07:05:12.628 --> 07:05:12.638 align:start position:0%
myself but i think they work
 
07:05:15.190 --> 07:05:15.200 align:start position:0%
i agree they did i yeah but participated
 
07:05:16.948 --> 07:05:16.958 align:start position:0%
in some of that yeah though articulation
 
07:05:19.270 --> 07:05:19.280 align:start position:0%
agreements between the levels is very
 
07:05:19.280 --> 07:05:21.030 align:start position:0%
agreements between the levels is very
important

07:05:21.030 --> 07:05:21.040 align:start position:0%
important
 
07:05:22.310 --> 07:05:22.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:05:22.320 --> 07:05:23.270 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

07:05:23.270 --> 07:05:23.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:05:25.110 --> 07:05:25.120 align:start position:0%
representative ford you've got half the
 
07:05:26.390 --> 07:05:26.400 align:start position:0%
process down
 
07:05:30.948 --> 07:05:30.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:05:30.958 --> 07:05:31.910 align:start position:0%
 
okay

07:05:31.910 --> 07:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
07:05:34.230 --> 07:05:34.240 align:start position:0%
any further questions from the committee
 
07:05:39.510 --> 07:05:39.520 align:start position:0%
uh seeing none thank you uh thank you
 
07:05:41.350 --> 07:05:41.360 align:start position:0%
next is
 
07:05:54.628 --> 07:05:54.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:05:56.548 --> 07:05:56.558 align:start position:0%
all right thank you mr chairman and
 
07:05:57.910 --> 07:05:57.920 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the
 
07:06:00.788 --> 07:06:00.798 align:start position:0%
opportunity to testify here today
 
07:06:02.628 --> 07:06:02.638 align:start position:0%
my name is sarah scott and i'm the
 
07:06:04.788 --> 07:06:04.798 align:start position:0%
director of grassroots operations with
 
07:06:07.270 --> 07:06:07.280 align:start position:0%
americans for prosperity new hampshire
 
07:06:10.468 --> 07:06:10.478 align:start position:0%
and on behalf of afp new hampshire and
 
07:06:13.030 --> 07:06:13.040 align:start position:0%
our activists all across the state we
 
07:06:16.230 --> 07:06:16.240 align:start position:0%
urge you to support house bill 1329
 
07:06:18.390 --> 07:06:18.400 align:start position:0%
which would solidify alternative
 
07:06:20.310 --> 07:06:20.320 align:start position:0%
learning programs and specifically the
 
07:06:23.110 --> 07:06:23.120 align:start position:0%
learn everywhere program into statute
 
07:06:25.510 --> 07:06:25.520 align:start position:0%
so back in 2018
 
07:06:27.830 --> 07:06:27.840 align:start position:0%
the legislature passed legislation
 
07:06:29.910 --> 07:06:29.920 align:start position:0%
enabling the learn everywhere program
 
07:06:31.590 --> 07:06:31.600 align:start position:0%
which gives students credit for the
 
07:06:33.430 --> 07:06:33.440 align:start position:0%
learning that's already taking place
 
07:06:35.270 --> 07:06:35.280 align:start position:0%
outside of the classroom
 
07:06:37.510 --> 07:06:37.520 align:start position:0%
and this legislation allowed the new
 
07:06:39.590 --> 07:06:39.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire department of education to
 
07:06:41.590 --> 07:06:41.600 align:start position:0%
then go and develop a program that has
 
07:06:43.510 --> 07:06:43.520 align:start position:0%
really been at the forefront of
 
07:06:45.590 --> 07:06:45.600 align:start position:0%
innovation among other states
 
07:06:47.030 --> 07:06:47.040 align:start position:0%
so since the launch of the learn
 
07:06:49.110 --> 07:06:49.120 align:start position:0%
everywhere program back at the end of
 
07:06:49.120 --> 07:06:50.548 align:start position:0%
everywhere program back at the end of
2020

07:06:50.548 --> 07:06:50.558 align:start position:0%
2020
 
07:06:52.628 --> 07:06:52.638 align:start position:0%
we've had at least a dozen programs that
 
07:06:54.468 --> 07:06:54.478 align:start position:0%
have been approved for credit
 
07:06:56.310 --> 07:06:56.320 align:start position:0%
and this has given thousands of new
 
07:06:58.708 --> 07:06:58.718 align:start position:0%
hampshire students access to high school
 
07:06:59.910 --> 07:06:59.920 align:start position:0%
credit for the learning that they're
 
07:07:02.230 --> 07:07:02.240 align:start position:0%
already participating in so this
 
07:07:04.948 --> 07:07:04.958 align:start position:0%
includes organizations such as first
 
07:07:04.958 --> 07:07:06.150 align:start position:0%
includes organizations such as first
robotics

07:07:06.150 --> 07:07:06.160 align:start position:0%
robotics
 
07:07:08.230 --> 07:07:08.240 align:start position:0%
the seacoast science center and the boys
 
07:07:10.628 --> 07:07:10.638 align:start position:0%
and girls club of souhegan valley so
 
07:07:12.948 --> 07:07:12.958 align:start position:0%
students participating in these programs
 
07:07:14.788 --> 07:07:14.798 align:start position:0%
will now have time to explore new
 
07:07:17.270 --> 07:07:17.280 align:start position:0%
subject areas or get extra help where
 
07:07:18.948 --> 07:07:18.958 align:start position:0%
they might be struggling
 
07:07:20.948 --> 07:07:20.958 align:start position:0%
so this legislation would solidify
 
07:07:22.788 --> 07:07:22.798 align:start position:0%
programs like learn everywhere and
 
07:07:24.468 --> 07:07:24.478 align:start position:0%
ensure that these students continue to
 
07:07:25.990 --> 07:07:26.000 align:start position:0%
receive credit for the learning that's
 
07:07:28.150 --> 07:07:28.160 align:start position:0%
already taking place so it's for these
 
07:07:30.310 --> 07:07:30.320 align:start position:0%
reasons that we ask that you recommend
 
07:07:32.708 --> 07:07:32.718 align:start position:0%
this legislation as ought to pass and
 
07:07:34.390 --> 07:07:34.400 align:start position:0%
continue to allow new hampshire high
 
07:07:36.390 --> 07:07:36.400 align:start position:0%
school students to earn credit for the
 
07:07:38.548 --> 07:07:38.558 align:start position:0%
learning that takes place both in and
 
07:07:40.390 --> 07:07:40.400 align:start position:0%
outside of the classroom
 
07:07:42.310 --> 07:07:42.320 align:start position:0%
so i wanted to kind of cover a couple of
 
07:07:44.868 --> 07:07:44.878 align:start position:0%
the questions that representatives asked
 
07:07:44.878 --> 07:07:46.310 align:start position:0%
the questions that representatives asked
earlier

07:07:46.310 --> 07:07:46.320 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
07:07:48.548 --> 07:07:48.558 align:start position:0%
so i'm forgetting a lot of them but i
 
07:07:50.310 --> 07:07:50.320 align:start position:0%
know representative tanner asked one
 
07:07:50.320 --> 07:07:51.190 align:start position:0%
know representative tanner asked one
about

07:07:51.190 --> 07:07:51.200 align:start position:0%
about
 
07:07:51.200 --> 07:07:52.150 align:start position:0%
about
credits

07:07:52.150 --> 07:07:52.160 align:start position:0%
credits
 
07:07:54.310 --> 07:07:54.320 align:start position:0%
and i wanted to speak specifically about
 
07:07:56.070 --> 07:07:56.080 align:start position:0%
the learn everywhere program how credits
 
07:07:57.910 --> 07:07:57.920 align:start position:0%
are determined there
 
07:07:59.510 --> 07:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
so if a program would like to be
 
07:08:01.110 --> 07:08:01.120 align:start position:0%
approved by
 
07:08:03.590 --> 07:08:03.600 align:start position:0%
as a learn everywhere provider they go
 
07:08:05.590 --> 07:08:05.600 align:start position:0%
through and submit an application to the
 
07:08:07.430 --> 07:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
state board of education
 
07:08:09.750 --> 07:08:09.760 align:start position:0%
and part of that application process
 
07:08:12.948 --> 07:08:12.958 align:start position:0%
includes competencies and right now
 
07:08:14.868 --> 07:08:14.878 align:start position:0%
the local public schools determine
 
07:08:17.750 --> 07:08:17.760 align:start position:0%
credits based on competencies and the
 
07:08:19.750 --> 07:08:19.760 align:start position:0%
learner everywhere programs do the same
 
07:08:21.190 --> 07:08:21.200 align:start position:0%
so if a course
 
07:08:24.070 --> 07:08:24.080 align:start position:0%
was submitted an application that had
 
07:08:26.468 --> 07:08:26.478 align:start position:0%
two competencies for example it wouldn't
 
07:08:28.070 --> 07:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
count as a full year of learning because
 
07:08:29.830 --> 07:08:29.840 align:start position:0%
that's not what's counted at a local
 
07:08:31.030 --> 07:08:31.040 align:start position:0%
public school
 
07:08:31.040 --> 07:08:31.830 align:start position:0%
public school
so

07:08:31.830 --> 07:08:31.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:08:33.670 --> 07:08:33.680 align:start position:0%
they line up the competencies number of
 
07:08:36.390 --> 07:08:36.400 align:start position:0%
competencies based on the credit hours
 
07:08:37.350 --> 07:08:37.360 align:start position:0%
for that
 
07:08:39.270 --> 07:08:39.280 align:start position:0%
and these are things that go through a
 
07:08:40.788 --> 07:08:40.798 align:start position:0%
process of
 
07:08:42.390 --> 07:08:42.400 align:start position:0%
not just laying out the
 
07:08:44.230 --> 07:08:44.240 align:start position:0%
competencies but explaining how their
 
07:08:46.628 --> 07:08:46.638 align:start position:0%
programs match up to that and then going
 
07:08:48.150 --> 07:08:48.160 align:start position:0%
through and seeing asking how you
 
07:08:50.230 --> 07:08:50.240 align:start position:0%
evaluate students progress on it and
 
07:08:52.150 --> 07:08:52.160 align:start position:0%
then how you determine when mastery is
 
07:08:54.390 --> 07:08:54.400 align:start position:0%
met so these programs go through a
 
07:08:57.190 --> 07:08:57.200 align:start position:0%
pretty substantial application process
 
07:08:58.868 --> 07:08:58.878 align:start position:0%
they're reviewed by the department and
 
07:08:58.878 --> 07:09:00.230 align:start position:0%
they're reviewed by the department and
then

07:09:00.230 --> 07:09:00.240 align:start position:0%
then
 
07:09:02.150 --> 07:09:02.160 align:start position:0%
teachers as well and then they go before
 
07:09:04.468 --> 07:09:04.478 align:start position:0%
the state board of education
 
07:09:05.990 --> 07:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
i know there were other questions but i
 
07:09:07.350 --> 07:09:07.360 align:start position:0%
couldn't remember them so i'm happy to
 
07:09:09.430 --> 07:09:09.440 align:start position:0%
take any other questions
 
07:09:10.390 --> 07:09:10.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:09:12.230 --> 07:09:12.240 align:start position:0%
representative porter
 
07:09:13.110 --> 07:09:13.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:09:15.590 --> 07:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
at any point in that process
 
07:09:17.990 --> 07:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
do local school boards get to approve
 
07:09:19.750 --> 07:09:19.760 align:start position:0%
these programs
 
07:09:22.868 --> 07:09:22.878 align:start position:0%
so i would say this is about the same as
 
07:09:25.590 --> 07:09:25.600 align:start position:0%
if a student took a vlax course
 
07:09:27.590 --> 07:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
so right now students that take velox
 
07:09:29.590 --> 07:09:29.600 align:start position:0%
courses go in and they're approved at
 
07:09:31.750 --> 07:09:31.760 align:start position:0%
the local public school
 
07:09:33.910 --> 07:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
this is the same exact process
 
07:09:35.190 --> 07:09:35.200 align:start position:0%
the majority of learn everywhere
 
07:09:36.868 --> 07:09:36.878 align:start position:0%
programs actually base their
 
07:09:39.430 --> 07:09:39.440 align:start position:0%
competencies off of the um vlax
 
07:09:42.070 --> 07:09:42.080 align:start position:0%
competencies so they're already approved
 
07:09:43.910 --> 07:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
um and it's the same coursework then
 
07:09:46.390 --> 07:09:46.400 align:start position:0%
going into the local schools
 
07:09:48.948 --> 07:09:48.958 align:start position:0%
follow-up yeah who approved the v-x
 
07:09:50.628 --> 07:09:50.638 align:start position:0%
i believe it's approved at the state
 
07:09:51.750 --> 07:09:51.760 align:start position:0%
level but it's something that's
 
07:09:53.830 --> 07:09:53.840 align:start position:0%
currently accepted and widely accepted
 
07:09:55.510 --> 07:09:55.520 align:start position:0%
throughout the public schools here do
 
07:09:57.910 --> 07:09:57.920 align:start position:0%
all public schools accept it yes thank
 
07:09:57.920 --> 07:09:59.030 align:start position:0%
all public schools accept it yes thank
you

07:09:59.030 --> 07:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
you
 
07:10:01.430 --> 07:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
thank you any further
 
07:10:04.230 --> 07:10:04.240 align:start position:0%
uh questions um actually i have one
 
07:10:05.670 --> 07:10:05.680 align:start position:0%
maybe if i could
 
07:10:07.430 --> 07:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
jump in
 
07:10:11.030 --> 07:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:10:14.310 --> 07:10:14.320 align:start position:0%
since afp is a national organization do
 
07:10:16.070 --> 07:10:16.080 align:start position:0%
you have any idea is
 
07:10:19.350 --> 07:10:19.360 align:start position:0%
this learn everywhere program unique to
 
07:10:20.628 --> 07:10:20.638 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
07:10:22.868 --> 07:10:22.878 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um so new
 
07:10:24.948 --> 07:10:24.958 align:start position:0%
hampshire was the first state to come up
 
07:10:26.548 --> 07:10:26.558 align:start position:0%
with the learn everywhere program but
 
07:10:28.390 --> 07:10:28.400 align:start position:0%
since then it's been passed in a number
 
07:10:30.150 --> 07:10:30.160 align:start position:0%
of different states
 
07:10:31.830 --> 07:10:31.840 align:start position:0%
i know it's in probably at least three
 
07:10:34.070 --> 07:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
or four right now and other
 
07:10:35.590 --> 07:10:35.600 align:start position:0%
states are looking to pass the same
 
07:10:38.390 --> 07:10:38.400 align:start position:0%
legislation this year largely brought on
 
07:10:40.868 --> 07:10:40.878 align:start position:0%
by um the pandemic and they've found
 
07:10:42.708 --> 07:10:42.718 align:start position:0%
that kids that were staying home over
 
07:10:44.628 --> 07:10:44.638 align:start position:0%
the course of the last year have found a
 
07:10:46.310 --> 07:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
number of different alternative programs
 
07:10:48.150 --> 07:10:48.160 align:start position:0%
that they've been participating in and
 
07:10:49.830 --> 07:10:49.840 align:start position:0%
so now they're trying to go back and
 
07:10:51.510 --> 07:10:51.520 align:start position:0%
figure out how kids can get credit for
 
07:10:53.990 --> 07:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
that um in these states and what they've
 
07:10:55.510 --> 07:10:55.520 align:start position:0%
kind of looked forward to model based
 
07:10:56.948 --> 07:10:56.958 align:start position:0%
off of this is the learn everywhere
 
07:10:56.958 --> 07:10:58.708 align:start position:0%
off of this is the learn everywhere
program

07:10:58.708 --> 07:10:58.718 align:start position:0%
program
 
07:11:01.510 --> 07:11:01.520 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative mullen
 
07:11:04.548 --> 07:11:04.558 align:start position:0%
we have a good memory mr chair thank you
 
07:11:06.150 --> 07:11:06.160 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
07:11:08.868 --> 07:11:08.878 align:start position:0%
question ms scott um back
 
07:11:11.750 --> 07:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
to your comments about not offering full
 
07:11:13.750 --> 07:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
credit if something
 
07:11:16.070 --> 07:11:16.080 align:start position:0%
met two competencies but that didn't
 
07:11:18.708 --> 07:11:18.718 align:start position:0%
seem to equate to a full semester of
 
07:11:20.548 --> 07:11:20.558 align:start position:0%
study or whatever
 
07:11:21.670 --> 07:11:21.680 align:start position:0%
is that
 
07:11:25.270 --> 07:11:25.280 align:start position:0%
how places like the boys and girls club
 
07:11:26.788 --> 07:11:26.798 align:start position:0%
or whatever
 
07:11:29.750 --> 07:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
qualify as learn everywhere programs
 
07:11:30.948 --> 07:11:30.958 align:start position:0%
would they
 
07:11:30.958 --> 07:11:32.230 align:start position:0%
would they
award

07:11:32.230 --> 07:11:32.240 align:start position:0%
award
 
07:11:35.510 --> 07:11:35.520 align:start position:0%
a competency in let's say
 
07:11:39.750 --> 07:11:39.760 align:start position:0%
physical fitness or pe or whatever but
 
07:11:42.628 --> 07:11:42.638 align:start position:0%
not in a subject matter
 
07:11:44.548 --> 07:11:44.558 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question so
 
07:11:47.430 --> 07:11:47.440 align:start position:0%
essentially how it works now is programs
 
07:11:49.270 --> 07:11:49.280 align:start position:0%
apply to the program not just as a
 
07:11:51.750 --> 07:11:51.760 align:start position:0%
provider but they apply for a specific
 
07:11:54.708 --> 07:11:54.718 align:start position:0%
program so the boys and girls clubs
 
07:11:56.628 --> 07:11:56.638 align:start position:0%
specifically applied for a theater
 
07:11:56.638 --> 07:11:57.750 align:start position:0%
specifically applied for a theater
credit

07:11:57.750 --> 07:11:57.760 align:start position:0%
credit
 
07:12:00.230 --> 07:12:00.240 align:start position:0%
so they went through and found the
 
07:12:02.150 --> 07:12:02.160 align:start position:0%
competencies that would they looked at
 
07:12:04.788 --> 07:12:04.798 align:start position:0%
velox and other public schools and what
 
07:12:05.750 --> 07:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
they would have gone through for
 
07:12:07.830 --> 07:12:07.840 align:start position:0%
competencies and then
 
07:12:07.840 --> 07:12:09.030 align:start position:0%
competencies and then
essentially

07:12:09.030 --> 07:12:09.040 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
07:12:11.590 --> 07:12:11.600 align:start position:0%
picked which ones they followed and said
 
07:12:13.110 --> 07:12:13.120 align:start position:0%
this is how we can explain it and then
 
07:12:14.948 --> 07:12:14.958 align:start position:0%
they matched up what their program does
 
07:12:17.030 --> 07:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
and how it aligns to those competencies
 
07:12:21.990 --> 07:12:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:12:23.750 --> 07:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
representative tanner
 
07:12:26.230 --> 07:12:26.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um i'm just wondering
 
07:12:26.240 --> 07:12:27.270 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um i'm just wondering
um

07:12:27.270 --> 07:12:27.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:12:29.030 --> 07:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
what what is the involvement in the
 
07:12:30.708 --> 07:12:30.718 align:start position:0%
americans for prosperity with the
 
07:12:32.708 --> 07:12:32.718 align:start position:0%
alternate with uh learn everywhere
 
07:12:32.718 --> 07:12:33.910 align:start position:0%
alternate with uh learn everywhere
program

07:12:33.910 --> 07:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
program
 
07:12:35.990 --> 07:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question so we're
 
07:12:38.548 --> 07:12:38.558 align:start position:0%
just advocating that
 
07:12:41.030 --> 07:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
people are able to participate in it
 
07:12:44.230 --> 07:12:44.240 align:start position:0%
this is one of many programs that we
 
07:12:46.628 --> 07:12:46.638 align:start position:0%
kind of would say educate people on
 
07:12:48.390 --> 07:12:48.400 align:start position:0%
we've also done it on any number of
 
07:12:51.110 --> 07:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
other learning options whether it be
 
07:12:53.670 --> 07:12:53.680 align:start position:0%
charter schools public schools home
 
07:12:56.070 --> 07:12:56.080 align:start position:0%
schools micro schools anything like that
 
07:12:58.070 --> 07:12:58.080 align:start position:0%
that gives kids more options
 
07:12:59.270 --> 07:12:59.280 align:start position:0%
always something that we're going out
 
07:13:02.390 --> 07:13:02.400 align:start position:0%
and talking to parents about
 
07:13:04.310 --> 07:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
and i have also spoken with a number of
 
07:13:06.628 --> 07:13:06.638 align:start position:0%
different organizations about applying
 
07:13:07.830 --> 07:13:07.840 align:start position:0%
for it
 
07:13:09.510 --> 07:13:09.520 align:start position:0%
pretty much all of the
 
07:13:11.270 --> 07:13:11.280 align:start position:0%
currently approved programs are things
 
07:13:14.310 --> 07:13:14.320 align:start position:0%
that various people have suggested and
 
07:13:16.310 --> 07:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
brought in so one of the programs that
 
07:13:19.030 --> 07:13:19.040 align:start position:0%
was approved was a karate school i've
 
07:13:21.510 --> 07:13:21.520 align:start position:0%
done karate for a number of years and i
 
07:13:23.350 --> 07:13:23.360 align:start position:0%
ran a school by myself so i thought this
 
07:13:24.708 --> 07:13:24.718 align:start position:0%
was a really good program for those
 
07:13:26.628 --> 07:13:26.638 align:start position:0%
schools to get in so it's kind of just
 
07:13:28.230 --> 07:13:28.240 align:start position:0%
like that where
 
07:13:29.590 --> 07:13:29.600 align:start position:0%
people from across the state have
 
07:13:31.270 --> 07:13:31.280 align:start position:0%
suggested various programs and
 
07:13:34.310 --> 07:13:34.320 align:start position:0%
encouraged them to apply
 
07:13:35.670 --> 07:13:35.680 align:start position:0%
you may
 
07:13:37.990 --> 07:13:38.000 align:start position:0%
uh thank you as if as a follow-up is
 
07:13:39.910 --> 07:13:39.920 align:start position:0%
there any financial involvement other
 
07:13:42.310 --> 07:13:42.320 align:start position:0%
than perhaps hiring you as a lobbyist is
 
07:13:43.990 --> 07:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
that is that the only financial
 
07:13:45.590 --> 07:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
involvement you have with the learn
 
07:13:49.350 --> 07:13:49.360 align:start position:0%
everywhere program uh yes thank you
 
07:13:52.230 --> 07:13:52.240 align:start position:0%
