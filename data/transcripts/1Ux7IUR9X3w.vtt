00:13:54.350 --> 00:13:54.360 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to run through this if
 
00:13:55.550 --> 00:13:55.560 align:start position:0%
there's any other questions we'll have
 
00:13:57.110 --> 00:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
more than enough time and opportunities
 
00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:01.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:03.240 align:start position:0%

00:14:24.889 --> 00:14:24.899 align:start position:0%
it light here dressing decorum we we are
 
00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:27.600 align:start position:0%
still doing the people's business and so
 
00:14:29.569 --> 00:14:29.579 align:start position:0%

respectful
 
00:14:42.829 --> 00:14:42.839 align:start position:0%
um and even though we do keep things
 
00:14:44.509 --> 00:14:44.519 align:start position:0%
late here we do have to follow some
 
00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
decorum uh and structure otherwise it
 
00:14:49.250 --> 00:14:49.260 align:start position:0%
would be a free-for-all I'll get into
 
00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:51.300 align:start position:0%
that in a little bit uh General ground
 
00:14:55.189 --> 00:14:55.199 align:start position:0%
rules uh please no food no coffee
 
00:14:56.990 --> 00:14:57.000 align:start position:0%
um if you do want to bring water in
 
00:14:59.569 --> 00:14:59.579 align:start position:0%
that's fine I try to keep mine on the
 
00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:01.500 align:start position:0%
floor I ask everybody to do the same it
 
00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:03.060 align:start position:0%
just looks better especially now that
 
00:15:05.629 --> 00:15:05.639 align:start position:0%
we're on Zoom uh that our table doesn't
 
00:15:08.210 --> 00:15:08.220 align:start position:0%
look like a bar
 
00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:09.889 align:start position:0%
look like a bar
um

00:15:09.889 --> 00:15:09.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:12.360 align:start position:0%
obviously no food during public hearings
 
00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:13.790 align:start position:0%
obviously no food during public hearings
either

00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:13.800 align:start position:0%
either
 
00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:15.600 align:start position:0%
anybody with any medical issues just
 
00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:17.160 align:start position:0%
notify me on the side if there's any
 
00:15:19.370 --> 00:15:19.380 align:start position:0%
special things I need to do for you
 
00:15:21.650 --> 00:15:21.660 align:start position:0%
uh one touchy one and we keep going back
 
00:15:23.210 --> 00:15:23.220 align:start position:0%
and forth on this is the use of
 
00:15:24.829 --> 00:15:24.839 align:start position:0%
electronic devices
 
00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
I've got mine here today
 
00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:28.430 align:start position:0%
I've got mine here today
um

00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:28.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:30.650 --> 00:15:30.660 align:start position:0%
but our house has gone back and forth on
 
00:15:32.389 --> 00:15:32.399 align:start position:0%
this in terms of rules at one point we
 
00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
weren't allowed to have them at all when
 
00:15:36.530 --> 00:15:36.540 align:start position:0%
we're having public hearings
 
00:15:38.629 --> 00:15:38.639 align:start position:0%
we're supposed to be giving the people
 
00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:40.920 align:start position:0%
testifying before us our utmost
 
00:15:43.189 --> 00:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
attention and it doesn't look good when
 
00:15:44.930 --> 00:15:44.940 align:start position:0%
you've got things turned up and
 
00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
everybody and you're blocking the view
 
00:15:49.610 --> 00:15:49.620 align:start position:0%
of the person testifying however since
 
00:15:51.889 --> 00:15:51.899 align:start position:0%
then they they do come in handy if you
 
00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:54.180 align:start position:0%
use a rate because you can seek a lot of
 
00:15:56.210 --> 00:15:56.220 align:start position:0%
information while even during a hearing
 
00:15:56.220 --> 00:15:57.110 align:start position:0%
information while even during a hearing
so

00:15:57.110 --> 00:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:15:58.670 --> 00:15:58.680 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to say well you can't have
 
00:16:00.170 --> 00:16:00.180 align:start position:0%
them on the table at this point let's
 
00:16:01.850 --> 00:16:01.860 align:start position:0%
use common sense for now and we'll see
 
00:16:04.610 --> 00:16:04.620 align:start position:0%
how it goes uh but but I ask when people
 
00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
are testifying that's what they're here
 
00:16:08.389 --> 00:16:08.399 align:start position:0%
for and it's our job and our duty to
 
00:16:11.269 --> 00:16:11.279 align:start position:0%
give them our attention
 
00:16:12.889 --> 00:16:12.899 align:start position:0%
um so you all know I don't know if
 
00:16:16.069 --> 00:16:16.079 align:start position:0%
you've seen yet there is in the office a
 
00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:17.820 align:start position:0%
set of cabinets you all will have an
 
00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:20.100 align:start position:0%
assigned drawer pretty good size for
 
00:16:21.050 --> 00:16:21.060 align:start position:0%
anything you need to keep their
 
00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:23.880 align:start position:0%
paperwork and such
 
00:16:26.389 --> 00:16:26.399 align:start position:0%
um we do well I don't need to mention
 
00:16:27.769 --> 00:16:27.779 align:start position:0%
that one
 
00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:30.360 align:start position:0%
um fire alarm exits Etc we do have
 
00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:32.160 align:start position:0%
charts in the office and in the hallway
 
00:16:34.069 --> 00:16:34.079 align:start position:0%
we can go over those on a one by one
 
00:16:36.889 --> 00:16:36.899 align:start position:0%
basis if you if you need to see them
 
00:16:36.899 --> 00:16:38.090 align:start position:0%
basis if you if you need to see them
um

00:16:38.090 --> 00:16:38.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:39.889 align:start position:0%
um
okay

00:16:39.889 --> 00:16:39.899 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:16:41.449 --> 00:16:41.459 align:start position:0%
bear with me here I am a little bit
 
00:16:43.490 --> 00:16:43.500 align:start position:0%
Rusty myself
 
00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:45.480 align:start position:0%
our committee in general partisan
 
00:16:48.170 --> 00:16:48.180 align:start position:0%
balance well interestingly enough first
 
00:16:49.850 --> 00:16:49.860 align:start position:0%
time I've seen it this is actually my
 
00:16:51.470 --> 00:16:51.480 align:start position:0%
sixth term on this committee but we are
 
00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:54.720 align:start position:0%
10 10. even all the Committees with the
 
00:16:56.329 --> 00:16:56.339 align:start position:0%
exception of rules I believe is an even
 
00:16:58.610 --> 00:16:58.620 align:start position:0%
split this year
 
00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:00.600 align:start position:0%
um today committee seating I did assign
 
00:17:01.970 --> 00:17:01.980 align:start position:0%
these seats for today
 
00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:04.500 align:start position:0%
I don't think there were any issues but
 
00:17:07.970 --> 00:17:07.980 align:start position:0%
I may make an adjustment uh or two
 
00:17:10.250 --> 00:17:10.260 align:start position:0%
before next meeting
 
00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:13.260 align:start position:0%
um but but it is my My Prerogative uh
 
00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:14.760 align:start position:0%
and it was the speaker this year that's
 
00:17:16.429 --> 00:17:16.439 align:start position:0%
that asked for mixed seating I did the
 
00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:18.240 align:start position:0%
best I could mixing it but when you've
 
00:17:20.329 --> 00:17:20.339 align:start position:0%
got a few in the front that kind of
 
00:17:22.429 --> 00:17:22.439 align:start position:0%
takes the uh takes the ability to go
 
00:17:25.970 --> 00:17:25.980 align:start position:0%
even uh you know every other impossible
 
00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:28.610 align:start position:0%
even uh you know every other impossible
uh

00:17:28.610 --> 00:17:28.620 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:30.660 align:start position:0%
uh typical build topics I'll touch on
 
00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:31.980 align:start position:0%
this one for a second because there's a
 
00:17:33.950 --> 00:17:33.960 align:start position:0%
lot of confusion
 
00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:34.690 align:start position:0%
lot of confusion
um

00:17:34.690 --> 00:17:34.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:36.770 --> 00:17:36.780 align:start position:0%
transportation we we deal with motor
 
00:17:37.909 --> 00:17:37.919 align:start position:0%
vehicle law
 
00:17:40.610 --> 00:17:40.620 align:start position:0%
for the most part A lot of people still
 
00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
think that we deal with the monies and
 
00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:45.720 align:start position:0%
funding that's actually Public Works so
 
00:17:48.850 --> 00:17:48.860 align:start position:0%
on Lake Washington for example we
 
00:17:52.549 --> 00:17:52.559 align:start position:0%
discuss specialize in just the the the
 
00:17:54.710 --> 00:17:54.720 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle law itself not the money
 
00:17:57.830 --> 00:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
and not the maintenance of our roads
 
00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:01.070 align:start position:0%
and not the maintenance of our roads
um

00:18:01.070 --> 00:18:01.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:03.240 align:start position:0%
second committee work that's what early
 
00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:05.400 align:start position:0%
bills by the way we do have seven early
 
00:18:08.230 --> 00:18:08.240 align:start position:0%
bills this week uh this year
 
00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
so for an example if it if it deals with
 
00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:12.600 align:start position:0%
some monies
 
00:18:15.049 --> 00:18:15.059 align:start position:0%
we will vote on it and if it's a
 
00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:17.340 align:start position:0%
positive motion and it succeeds then
 
00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:20.160 align:start position:0%
it'll go to say uh Finance for example
 
00:18:22.250 --> 00:18:22.260 align:start position:0%
so we do have seven bills that are going
 
00:18:23.570 --> 00:18:23.580 align:start position:0%
to require the attention of two
 
00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:26.630 align:start position:0%
to require the attention of two
committees

00:18:26.630 --> 00:18:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:28.490 --> 00:18:28.500 align:start position:0%
I'm sure you've all seen between the
 
00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:30.480 align:start position:0%
orientations the calendar watch for
 
00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:32.090 align:start position:0%
orientations the calendar watch for
notices

00:18:32.090 --> 00:18:32.100 align:start position:0%
notices
 
00:18:33.409 --> 00:18:33.419 align:start position:0%
um the deadline for me to get everything
 
00:18:35.029 --> 00:18:35.039 align:start position:0%
in the schedule or in the calendar is
 
00:18:35.039 --> 00:18:36.310 align:start position:0%
in the schedule or in the calendar is
Wednesdays

00:18:36.310 --> 00:18:36.320 align:start position:0%
Wednesdays
 
00:18:40.010 --> 00:18:40.020 align:start position:0%
Tuesdays is our day and so I will try to
 
00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
keep everything on Tuesdays
 
00:18:43.789 --> 00:18:43.799 align:start position:0%
but always keep an eye on the calendar
 
00:18:46.310 --> 00:18:46.320 align:start position:0%
weekly just to make sure things things
 
00:18:48.289 --> 00:18:48.299 align:start position:0%
don't change
 
00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:51.480 align:start position:0%
and I think
 
00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
I'll go over the public hearing and
 
00:18:55.310 --> 00:18:55.320 align:start position:0%
executive session I believe we've got
 
00:18:57.710 --> 00:18:57.720 align:start position:0%
some time afterwards before we get into
 
00:18:59.210 --> 00:18:59.220 align:start position:0%
the public hearing that I've scheduled
 
00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:01.200 align:start position:0%
this afternoon because I know we do have
 
00:19:03.650 --> 00:19:03.660 align:start position:0%
a lot of people that would like to do
 
00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:05.700 align:start position:0%
their introductions and so I've called
 
00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:08.280 align:start position:0%
in today the the faces that you will
 
00:19:10.610 --> 00:19:10.620 align:start position:0%
most usually see in transportation we've
 
00:19:11.810 --> 00:19:11.820 align:start position:0%
got Department of Motor Vehicles
 
00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:14.280 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety Department of
 
00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:16.200 align:start position:0%
Transportation I believe they were
 
00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:19.260 align:start position:0%
invited I don't see them yet but Marine
 
00:19:22.610 --> 00:19:22.620 align:start position:0%
Patrol and we have who else is coming
 
00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:25.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:27.650 --> 00:19:27.660 align:start position:0%
fish and game I did invite them as well
 
00:19:30.650 --> 00:19:30.660 align:start position:0%
we do every now and then get their input
 
00:19:34.549 --> 00:19:34.559 align:start position:0%
on ohrv bills
 
00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
uh and I do have a couple of surprise
 
00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
guests if we have time for introductions
 
00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
afterwards so uh with that being said
 
00:19:43.909 --> 00:19:43.919 align:start position:0%
I'm going to turn it over to director
 
00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
marasco from the Department of Motor
 
00:19:45.600 --> 00:54:18.349 align:start position:0%
marasco from the Department of Motor
Vehicles

00:54:18.349 --> 00:54:18.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:20.569 --> 00:54:20.579 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee
 
00:54:22.970 --> 00:54:22.980 align:start position:0%
representative Sykes
 
00:54:25.549 --> 00:54:25.559 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman director marasco
 
00:54:27.290 --> 00:54:27.300 align:start position:0%
can you make this slide presentation
 
00:54:29.210 --> 00:54:29.220 align:start position:0%
available to us
 
00:54:29.220 --> 00:54:30.170 align:start position:0%
available to us
okay

00:54:30.170 --> 00:54:30.180 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:54:32.089 --> 00:54:32.099 align:start position:0%
because it's got a lot of dense material
 
00:54:33.349 --> 00:54:33.359 align:start position:0%
in there and it would be nice to have it
 
00:54:35.930 --> 00:54:35.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:37.730 --> 00:54:37.740 align:start position:0%
yeah and actually I have to say
 
00:54:39.290 --> 00:54:39.300 align:start position:0%
something too I did see somebody come in
 
00:54:41.390 --> 00:54:41.400 align:start position:0%
the room for anybody watching online I
 
00:54:43.790 --> 00:54:43.800 align:start position:0%
do apologize and I'll take the hit I did
 
00:54:46.490 --> 00:54:46.500 align:start position:0%
make sure the room was set up for uh
 
00:54:48.049 --> 00:54:48.059 align:start position:0%
with a microphone for a PowerPoint
 
00:54:49.910 --> 00:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
presentation but there was no
 
00:54:51.470 --> 00:54:51.480 align:start position:0%
legislative activity going on it was
 
00:54:52.790 --> 00:54:52.800 align:start position:0%
merely an introduction by the department
 
00:54:55.190 --> 00:54:55.200 align:start position:0%
to our new members any other questions
 
00:54:59.349 --> 00:54:59.359 align:start position:0%
from the committee representative Jones
 
00:55:02.569 --> 00:55:02.579 align:start position:0%
excuse me representative Jones if you
 
00:55:03.650 --> 00:55:03.660 align:start position:0%
could answer the question on the
 
00:55:08.510 --> 00:55:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:10.490 --> 00:55:10.500 align:start position:0%
it's very simple
 
00:55:14.030 --> 00:55:14.040 align:start position:0%
um others um because of our econ
 
00:55:16.250 --> 00:55:16.260 align:start position:0%
economic problems a lot of it is being
 
00:55:19.190 --> 00:55:19.200 align:start position:0%
blamed on lack of truck drivers uh being
 
00:55:21.130 --> 00:55:21.140 align:start position:0%
out there and many states are facility
 
00:55:25.069 --> 00:55:25.079 align:start position:0%
facilitating the CDL process I know you
 
00:55:27.230 --> 00:55:27.240 align:start position:0%
talked about the mobile earlier and that
 
00:55:28.490 --> 00:55:28.500 align:start position:0%
sounds very good but is there anything
 
00:55:30.109 --> 00:55:30.119 align:start position:0%
else that
 
00:55:32.690 --> 00:55:32.700 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is doing to facilitate
 
00:55:37.069 --> 00:55:37.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:39.049 --> 00:55:39.059 align:start position:0%
question uh representative Jones thank
 
00:55:40.549 --> 00:55:40.559 align:start position:0%
you there are many things that are going
 
00:55:42.589 --> 00:55:42.599 align:start position:0%
on on the cdlfront expansion is one of
 
00:55:44.329 --> 00:55:44.339 align:start position:0%
them to make it more convenient
 
00:55:46.190 --> 00:55:46.200 align:start position:0%
geographically throughout the state to
 
00:55:48.290 --> 00:55:48.300 align:start position:0%
allow people to get there take their CDL
 
00:55:50.270 --> 00:55:50.280 align:start position:0%
exam the mobile vehicle is going to be
 
00:55:53.930 --> 00:55:53.940 align:start position:0%
very good having um a full eight CDL
 
00:55:56.210 --> 00:55:56.220 align:start position:0%
examiners to do the testing is going to
 
00:55:58.730 --> 00:55:58.740 align:start position:0%
be very important the other thing that
 
00:56:00.770 --> 00:56:00.780 align:start position:0%
that is being rolled out nationally and
 
00:56:02.270 --> 00:56:02.280 align:start position:0%
is a credit to administrator Jeff
 
00:56:05.450 --> 00:56:05.460 align:start position:0%
oberdank is a a new testing model for
 
00:56:07.490 --> 00:56:07.500 align:start position:0%
CDL that makes it more seamless a
 
00:56:09.710 --> 00:56:09.720 align:start position:0%
modernization model and New Hampshire
 
00:56:12.109 --> 00:56:12.119 align:start position:0%
was uh leading the way on that thanks to
 
00:56:14.809 --> 00:56:14.819 align:start position:0%
Jeff's hard work so that also is is
 
00:56:17.329 --> 00:56:17.339 align:start position:0%
going to uh to benefit the CDL Community
 
00:56:19.130 --> 00:56:19.140 align:start position:0%
the other thing is we're working with
 
00:56:21.290 --> 00:56:21.300 align:start position:0%
Bob Scully we have regular meetings with
 
00:56:24.290 --> 00:56:24.300 align:start position:0%
Bob and nhmta to figure out how we could
 
00:56:26.809 --> 00:56:26.819 align:start position:0%
be doing better for industry and I think
 
00:56:29.150 --> 00:56:29.160 align:start position:0%
that is there anything I'm missing on
 
00:56:31.849 --> 00:56:31.859 align:start position:0%
the CDL front Beyond those items Jeff
 
00:56:34.309 --> 00:56:34.319 align:start position:0%
yeah I would just uh what I would say
 
00:56:36.410 --> 00:56:36.420 align:start position:0%
and I belong in a number of national
 
00:56:38.150 --> 00:56:38.160 align:start position:0%
committees with Amber one of the things
 
00:56:40.670 --> 00:56:40.680 align:start position:0%
that we talk about we get on the calls
 
00:56:43.970 --> 00:56:43.980 align:start position:0%
is that New Hampshire is a pretty rare
 
00:56:46.069 --> 00:56:46.079 align:start position:0%
bird when it comes to CDL some states
 
00:56:47.990 --> 00:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
have up to six months wait time for a
 
00:56:49.250 --> 00:56:49.260 align:start position:0%
CDL test
 
00:56:51.290 --> 00:56:51.300 align:start position:0%
I mean imagine if your company is is
 
00:56:54.049 --> 00:56:54.059 align:start position:0%
needing drivers it's made it a place we
 
00:56:55.910 --> 00:56:55.920 align:start position:0%
we know for a fact that other companies
 
00:56:57.650 --> 00:56:57.660 align:start position:0%
are registering their vehicles and
 
00:56:59.150 --> 00:56:59.160 align:start position:0%
moving some of their operations here
 
00:57:01.670 --> 00:57:01.680 align:start position:0%
because of our CDL operation you can
 
00:57:03.950 --> 00:57:03.960 align:start position:0%
take the test and you can you can take
 
00:57:05.690 --> 00:57:05.700 align:start position:0%
the knowledge test and when after the
 
00:57:07.609 --> 00:57:07.619 align:start position:0%
the nationally mandated 10-day waiting
 
00:57:09.410 --> 00:57:09.420 align:start position:0%
period you can get a test on day 11.
 
00:57:14.270 --> 00:57:14.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:16.309 --> 00:57:16.319 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions from the
 
00:57:16.319 --> 00:57:17.990 align:start position:0%

committee

00:57:33.049 --> 00:57:33.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:34.670 --> 00:57:34.680 align:start position:0%
does anybody else have PowerPoints or
 
00:57:36.349 --> 00:57:36.359 align:start position:0%
was it just a DMV
 
00:57:38.950 --> 00:57:38.960 align:start position:0%
you do to it as well
 
00:57:38.960 --> 00:57:45.250 align:start position:0%
you do to it as well
[Laughter]

00:57:45.250 --> 00:57:45.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:47.569 --> 00:57:47.579 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairperson members of
 
00:57:49.130 --> 00:57:49.140 align:start position:0%
the committee for those of you who don't
 
00:57:50.690 --> 00:57:50.700 align:start position:0%
know me I'm Lieutenant Jay O'Leary I'm
 
00:57:52.430 --> 00:57:52.440 align:start position:0%
the commander at Troop G
 
00:57:55.250 --> 00:57:55.260 align:start position:0%
um it's nice to see some of the faces or
 
00:57:56.990 --> 00:57:57.000 align:start position:0%
all the faces from last session please
 
00:57:59.210 --> 00:57:59.220 align:start position:0%
don't hold my last session against me as
 
00:58:01.430 --> 00:58:01.440 align:start position:0%
it was my first one I am going to Breeze
 
00:58:02.990 --> 00:58:03.000 align:start position:0%
through just a quick overview of what
 
00:58:04.370 --> 00:58:04.380 align:start position:0%
our troop does I think it's important
 
00:58:06.109 --> 00:58:06.119 align:start position:0%
because we we will be working together
 
00:58:08.390 --> 00:58:08.400 align:start position:0%
along with industry leaders that you'll
 
00:58:11.210 --> 00:58:11.220 align:start position:0%
see that'll testify and essentially a
 
00:58:12.589 --> 00:58:12.599 align:start position:0%
lot of the hospitals you'll be voting on
 
00:58:14.990 --> 00:58:15.000 align:start position:0%
this session uh will be the one that'll
 
00:58:16.910 --> 00:58:16.920 align:start position:0%
be enforcing them so I just want to kind
 
00:58:18.410 --> 00:58:18.420 align:start position:0%
of give you some oversight and introduce
 
00:58:19.670 --> 00:58:19.680 align:start position:0%
you to some of our subject matter
 
00:58:21.770 --> 00:58:21.780 align:start position:0%
experts that will be providing testimony
 
00:58:24.109 --> 00:58:24.119 align:start position:0%
I don't consider myself one of them but
 
00:58:26.450 --> 00:58:26.460 align:start position:0%
so we are headquartered here in Concord
 
00:58:28.250 --> 00:58:28.260 align:start position:0%
and to talk about the relationship that
 
00:58:30.109 --> 00:58:30.119 align:start position:0%
we have with DMV very briefly we're
 
00:58:32.690 --> 00:58:32.700 align:start position:0%
actually located in the DMV itself on
 
00:58:34.010 --> 00:58:34.020 align:start position:0%
the first floor here in Concord
 
00:58:35.870 --> 00:58:35.880 align:start position:0%
everything that we do for the most part
 
00:58:37.490 --> 00:58:37.500 align:start position:0%
outside of our Federal Motor Carrier
 
00:58:39.890 --> 00:58:39.900 align:start position:0%
enforcement directly relates to
 
00:58:41.690 --> 00:58:41.700 align:start position:0%
something that's occurring at the DMV
 
00:58:43.670 --> 00:58:43.680 align:start position:0%
whether it be through enforcement of the
 
00:58:46.309 --> 00:58:46.319 align:start position:0%
dealer inspection rules or through
 
00:58:47.870 --> 00:58:47.880 align:start position:0%
driver education or Pupil Transportation
 
00:58:49.490 --> 00:58:49.500 align:start position:0%
essentially we're going where the the
 
00:58:52.370 --> 00:58:52.380 align:start position:0%
legal arm of those type types of
 
00:58:55.069 --> 00:58:55.079 align:start position:0%
programs the DMV programs we are
 
00:58:56.690 --> 00:58:56.700 align:start position:0%
separated into four two two main
 
00:58:58.010 --> 00:58:58.020 align:start position:0%
sections which is commercial Motor
 
00:58:59.870 --> 00:58:59.880 align:start position:0%
Vehicle Enforcement one side and the
 
00:59:01.609 --> 00:59:01.619 align:start position:0%
other one is known as field enforcement
 
00:59:03.950 --> 00:59:03.960 align:start position:0%
and field enforcement like I said talk
 
00:59:05.210 --> 00:59:05.220 align:start position:0%
is the dealership and inspection
 
00:59:07.130 --> 00:59:07.140 align:start position:0%
stations mechanics things like that so
 
00:59:10.069 --> 00:59:10.079 align:start position:0%
within that we have a couple other sub
 
00:59:13.069 --> 00:59:13.079 align:start position:0%
units which are the DMV task force which
 
00:59:14.930 --> 00:59:14.940 align:start position:0%
oversees our Pupil Transportation and
 
00:59:17.210 --> 00:59:17.220 align:start position:0%
driver education programs and lastly we
 
00:59:19.069 --> 00:59:19.079 align:start position:0%
have an investigations unit and they
 
00:59:20.809 --> 00:59:20.819 align:start position:0%
have a pretty um pretty tough job
 
00:59:22.130 --> 00:59:22.140 align:start position:0%
because they're the ones that are
 
00:59:23.510 --> 00:59:23.520 align:start position:0%
looking at all the fraud that's
 
00:59:25.370 --> 00:59:25.380 align:start position:0%
occurring at the DMV level so you can
 
00:59:28.370 --> 00:59:28.380 align:start position:0%
imagine securing identities securing
 
00:59:30.349 --> 00:59:30.359 align:start position:0%
titles or any of the documents that have
 
00:59:32.390 --> 00:59:32.400 align:start position:0%
to that come in through the DMV that's
 
00:59:34.430 --> 00:59:34.440 align:start position:0%
all that our investigations group does
 
00:59:37.190 --> 00:59:37.200 align:start position:0%
so that's a big task for them as well
 
00:59:38.690 --> 00:59:38.700 align:start position:0%
what makes us different is our
 
00:59:41.210 --> 00:59:41.220 align:start position:0%
day-to-day job is essentially dealing
 
00:59:43.010 --> 00:59:43.020 align:start position:0%
with that type of oversight so we cover
 
00:59:45.470 --> 00:59:45.480 align:start position:0%
the entire State unlike a regional troop
 
00:59:47.210 --> 00:59:47.220 align:start position:0%
where they they were essentially a
 
00:59:49.430 --> 00:59:49.440 align:start position:0%
patrol function in that area our primary
 
00:59:51.170 --> 00:59:51.180 align:start position:0%
role isn't a patrol function except for
 
00:59:52.670 --> 00:59:52.680 align:start position:0%
commercial Motor Vehicle Enforcement
 
00:59:56.510 --> 00:59:56.520 align:start position:0%
outside of that we are uh outside out
 
00:59:58.490 --> 00:59:58.500 align:start position:0%
doing Audits and things like that and
 
00:59:59.750 --> 00:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
investigations having to do with
 
01:00:01.250 --> 01:00:01.260 align:start position:0%
dealerships and inspection stations so
 
01:00:03.230 --> 01:00:03.240 align:start position:0%
that's our day-to-day in addition we
 
01:00:05.210 --> 01:00:05.220 align:start position:0%
work very closely with all the same type
 
01:00:06.410 --> 01:00:06.420 align:start position:0%
of Industry leaders that director
 
01:00:08.150 --> 01:00:08.160 align:start position:0%
marasco spoke of we work closely with
 
01:00:10.730 --> 01:00:10.740 align:start position:0%
nhada and members of the trans motor
 
01:00:12.589 --> 01:00:12.599 align:start position:0%
transport Association and why that's
 
01:00:14.569 --> 01:00:14.579 align:start position:0%
important is you know the goal would be
 
01:00:16.430 --> 01:00:16.440 align:start position:0%
that we're having those conversations
 
01:00:18.770 --> 01:00:18.780 align:start position:0%
with those industry leaders prior to
 
01:00:20.390 --> 01:00:20.400 align:start position:0%
sitting down here testifying before you
 
01:00:22.190 --> 01:00:22.200 align:start position:0%
so that we're all on the same page and
 
01:00:23.870 --> 01:00:23.880 align:start position:0%
hopefully coming together and trying to
 
01:00:25.910 --> 01:00:25.920 align:start position:0%
meet a resolution in whatever area that
 
01:00:27.710 --> 01:00:27.720 align:start position:0%
we're looking to improve I'm going to
 
01:00:30.230 --> 01:00:30.240 align:start position:0%
let staff sergeant come and speak to the
 
01:00:31.490 --> 01:00:31.500 align:start position:0%
field enforcement as that's the group
 
01:00:33.530 --> 01:00:33.540 align:start position:0%
that he oversees
 
01:00:35.210 --> 01:00:35.220 align:start position:0%
hi good morning my name is staff
 
01:00:37.130 --> 01:00:37.140 align:start position:0%
sergeant Tom Coleman I've been with The
 
01:00:39.410 --> 01:00:39.420 align:start position:0%
Troop G for just under a year now but
 
01:00:42.470 --> 01:00:42.480 align:start position:0%
State Police almost 17 years and so my
 
01:00:44.210 --> 01:00:44.220 align:start position:0%
area of responsibility falls to the
 
01:00:46.010 --> 01:00:46.020 align:start position:0%
field enforcement unit as well as the
 
01:00:47.809 --> 01:00:47.819 align:start position:0%
DMV task for which Lieutenant already
 
01:00:49.490 --> 01:00:49.500 align:start position:0%
mention is people Transportation driver
 
01:00:51.289 --> 01:00:51.299 align:start position:0%
education as well as the investigations
 
01:00:53.510 --> 01:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
unit so our field enforcement unit
 
01:00:56.030 --> 01:00:56.040 align:start position:0%
really the monitoring audit uh
 
01:00:57.950 --> 01:00:57.960 align:start position:0%
approximately 4 200 vehicle dealerships
 
01:00:59.750 --> 01:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
and inspection stations to ensure
 
01:01:00.950 --> 01:01:00.960 align:start position:0%
compliance with all the administrative
 
01:01:03.710 --> 01:01:03.720 align:start position:0%
rules so what this means is our Troopers
 
01:01:05.569 --> 01:01:05.579 align:start position:0%
and our AEI which are automotive
 
01:01:07.910 --> 01:01:07.920 align:start position:0%
equipment inspectors are with industry
 
01:01:09.650 --> 01:01:09.660 align:start position:0%
every single day we're out in the field
 
01:01:12.829 --> 01:01:12.839 align:start position:0%
at these dealerships in these locations
 
01:01:14.990 --> 01:01:15.000 align:start position:0%
conducting these audits working closely
 
01:01:16.430 --> 01:01:16.440 align:start position:0%
hand in hand
 
01:01:18.829 --> 01:01:18.839 align:start position:0%
uh we also do the opening and closing of
 
01:01:21.230 --> 01:01:21.240 align:start position:0%
all the vehicle dealers and inspection
 
01:01:24.650 --> 01:01:24.660 align:start position:0%
stations and we support the safety
 
01:01:26.870 --> 01:01:26.880 align:start position:0%
mechanic certification program so our
 
01:01:29.150 --> 01:01:29.160 align:start position:0%
aeis and our Troopers go out and
 
01:01:31.789 --> 01:01:31.799 align:start position:0%
actually run the certification tests for
 
01:01:33.230 --> 01:01:33.240 align:start position:0%
those mechanics
 
01:01:35.690 --> 01:01:35.700 align:start position:0%
well we also do habitual offender
 
01:01:37.970 --> 01:01:37.980 align:start position:0%
hearing notifications our Troopers go
 
01:01:39.710 --> 01:01:39.720 align:start position:0%
out and once a person who's been deemed
 
01:01:41.150 --> 01:01:41.160 align:start position:0%
habitual offender they need to be served
 
01:01:44.329 --> 01:01:44.339 align:start position:0%
paperwork we do that function as well
 
01:01:46.730 --> 01:01:46.740 align:start position:0%
this is on top of all the normal State
 
01:01:48.289 --> 01:01:48.299 align:start position:0%
Police duties that are enforcing the
 
01:01:51.650 --> 01:01:51.660 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:54.530 --> 01:01:54.540 align:start position:0%
so I already spoke about these uh folks
 
01:01:56.809 --> 01:01:56.819 align:start position:0%
briefly our aeis they're all skilled
 
01:01:58.609 --> 01:01:58.619 align:start position:0%
mechanics they'll come to us work at
 
01:02:00.829 --> 01:02:00.839 align:start position:0%
Troop G they have a lot of knowledge and
 
01:02:03.410 --> 01:02:03.420 align:start position:0%
experience in automotive industry uh
 
01:02:04.730 --> 01:02:04.740 align:start position:0%
they are responsible for the vast
 
01:02:07.130 --> 01:02:07.140 align:start position:0%
majority of the compliance audits
 
01:02:08.510 --> 01:02:08.520 align:start position:0%
um they can conduct reviews of the
 
01:02:10.010 --> 01:02:10.020 align:start position:0%
dealer and inspection station locations
 
01:02:11.990 --> 01:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
provide opening and they do field
 
01:02:14.089 --> 01:02:14.099 align:start position:0%
testing mechanics
 
01:02:16.069 --> 01:02:16.079 align:start position:0%
they also do which takes a lot of their
 
01:02:18.770 --> 01:02:18.780 align:start position:0%
time as a salvage process when a vehicle
 
01:02:20.390 --> 01:02:20.400 align:start position:0%
has been deemed a total loss by the
 
01:02:23.210 --> 01:02:23.220 align:start position:0%
insurance companies these individuals go
 
01:02:24.710 --> 01:02:24.720 align:start position:0%
out and uh
 
01:02:26.870 --> 01:02:26.880 align:start position:0%
inspect the vehicle to make sure it's it
 
01:02:28.370 --> 01:02:28.380 align:start position:0%
could be put back on the roads of New
 
01:02:28.380 --> 01:02:30.650 align:start position:0%
could be put back on the roads of New
Hampshire

01:02:30.650 --> 01:02:30.660 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:32.569 --> 01:02:32.579 align:start position:0%
so in part of the field enforcement unit
 
01:02:35.089 --> 01:02:35.099 align:start position:0%
is also our Troopers uh pretty much all
 
01:02:38.150 --> 01:02:38.160 align:start position:0%
the same duties as uh the aeis but a lot
 
01:02:39.829 --> 01:02:39.839 align:start position:0%
of the times when these audits turn
 
01:02:41.930 --> 01:02:41.940 align:start position:0%
criminal or conduct let's say the DMV
 
01:02:44.210 --> 01:02:44.220 align:start position:0%
turns criminal they come to Troopers to
 
01:02:47.270 --> 01:02:47.280 align:start position:0%
handle the investigative excuse me
 
01:02:49.069 --> 01:02:49.079 align:start position:0%
investigative side of that investigation
 
01:02:50.930 --> 01:02:50.940 align:start position:0%
or the enforcement inside of that
 
01:02:50.940 --> 01:02:53.150 align:start position:0%
or the enforcement inside of that
investigation

01:02:53.150 --> 01:02:53.160 align:start position:0%
investigation
 
01:02:56.030 --> 01:02:56.040 align:start position:0%
investigations unit uh station right
 
01:02:57.950 --> 01:02:57.960 align:start position:0%
here in Concord at the at Troop G
 
01:03:00.829 --> 01:03:00.839 align:start position:0%
barracks uh right now there's detective
 
01:03:02.089 --> 01:03:02.099 align:start position:0%
sergeant and we have two investigators
 
01:03:03.650 --> 01:03:03.660 align:start position:0%
we have three when they're fully staffed
 
01:03:05.630 --> 01:03:05.640 align:start position:0%
they attach to investigating title fraud
 
01:03:08.150 --> 01:03:08.160 align:start position:0%
uh vehicle theft and internal division
 
01:03:11.089 --> 01:03:11.099 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle uh investigations license
 
01:03:13.010 --> 01:03:13.020 align:start position:0%
registration fraud and identity theft
 
01:03:15.650 --> 01:03:15.660 align:start position:0%
identity theft really being a key
 
01:03:18.589 --> 01:03:18.599 align:start position:0%
um part of all this because we want to
 
01:03:20.150 --> 01:03:20.160 align:start position:0%
ensure that the credentials we're giving
 
01:03:22.430 --> 01:03:22.440 align:start position:0%
are residents of the state they're going
 
01:03:28.089 --> 01:03:28.099 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:30.230 --> 01:03:30.240 align:start position:0%
so next up I'd like to introduce you
 
01:03:33.349 --> 01:03:33.359 align:start position:0%
briefly is Trooper first class Rick
 
01:03:35.870 --> 01:03:35.880 align:start position:0%
Dupont he oversees our driver education
 
01:03:35.880 --> 01:03:37.490 align:start position:0%
Dupont he oversees our driver education
section

01:03:37.490 --> 01:03:37.500 align:start position:0%
section
 
01:03:40.750 --> 01:03:40.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:43.130 --> 01:03:43.140 align:start position:0%
and he'll probably be providing
 
01:03:46.789 --> 01:03:46.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:48.770 --> 01:03:48.780 align:start position:0%
but I can point Her Off on
 
01:03:52.670 --> 01:03:52.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:54.710 --> 01:03:54.720 align:start position:0%
I did have the opportunity to testify in
 
01:03:56.930 --> 01:03:56.940 align:start position:0%
2021 but
 
01:03:58.789 --> 01:03:58.799 align:start position:0%
so I
 
01:04:00.829 --> 01:04:00.839 align:start position:0%
my name is Trooper Rick Dupont I have
 
01:04:02.569 --> 01:04:02.579 align:start position:0%
been coming up a trooper coming up on
 
01:04:07.069 --> 01:04:07.079 align:start position:0%
almost 19 years and for most of that
 
01:04:09.109 --> 01:04:09.119 align:start position:0%
time I have been stationed at the
 
01:04:10.430 --> 01:04:10.440 align:start position:0%
Division of Motor Vehicles doing the
 
01:04:11.990 --> 01:04:12.000 align:start position:0%
various functions that staff sergeant
 
01:04:14.270 --> 01:04:14.280 align:start position:0%
Colin was speaking about either car
 
01:04:16.549 --> 01:04:16.559 align:start position:0%
dealerships inspection stations the
 
01:04:19.970 --> 01:04:19.980 align:start position:0%
investigations unit and for almost three
 
01:04:21.589 --> 01:04:21.599 align:start position:0%
years now I've been the supervisor of
 
01:04:22.849 --> 01:04:22.859 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's driver's education
 
01:04:22.859 --> 01:04:24.049 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's driver's education
program

01:04:24.049 --> 01:04:24.059 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:04:28.849 --> 01:04:28.859 align:start position:0%
and it's a lot of work but uh we
 
01:04:32.210 --> 01:04:32.220 align:start position:0%
we my office provides oversight and
 
01:04:34.549 --> 01:04:34.559 align:start position:0%
support to secondary high schools
 
01:04:35.990 --> 01:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
throughout the state
 
01:04:38.990 --> 01:04:39.000 align:start position:0%
we have approximately 67 commercial
 
01:04:41.809 --> 01:04:41.819 align:start position:0%
driver education schools and four of
 
01:04:44.270 --> 01:04:44.280 align:start position:0%
those schools are actually run by high
 
01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:45.670 align:start position:0%
those schools are actually run by high
schools

01:04:45.670 --> 01:04:45.680 align:start position:0%
schools
 
01:04:48.349 --> 01:04:48.359 align:start position:0%
I think years ago there was there was
 
01:04:50.510 --> 01:04:50.520 align:start position:0%
several more but there are only four
 
01:04:51.829 --> 01:04:51.839 align:start position:0%
currently in the state of New Hampshire
 
01:04:54.829 --> 01:04:54.839 align:start position:0%
we have approximately 160 active driver
 
01:04:57.349 --> 01:04:57.359 align:start position:0%
education instructors that number is
 
01:04:59.450 --> 01:04:59.460 align:start position:0%
changing almost monthly when people
 
01:05:03.170 --> 01:05:03.180 align:start position:0%
retire or they become instructors
 
01:05:05.450 --> 01:05:05.460 align:start position:0%
and I'm not bashful about asking people
 
01:05:06.530 --> 01:05:06.540 align:start position:0%
if they want to become a driver
 
01:05:07.970 --> 01:05:07.980 align:start position:0%
education instructor because we can
 
01:05:09.309 --> 01:05:09.319 align:start position:0%
always use more
 
01:05:12.049 --> 01:05:12.059 align:start position:0%
each of our instructors must uh
 
01:05:13.849 --> 01:05:13.859 align:start position:0%
successfully complete the nine credit
 
01:05:15.829 --> 01:05:15.839 align:start position:0%
driver education instructor curriculum
 
01:05:17.569 --> 01:05:17.579 align:start position:0%
that is offered through Keene State
 
01:05:19.430 --> 01:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
College and I'd like to also say through
 
01:05:21.890 --> 01:05:21.900 align:start position:0%
White Mountains Community College up in
 
01:05:24.710 --> 01:05:24.720 align:start position:0%
the Littleton Berlin area they've really
 
01:05:27.309 --> 01:05:27.319 align:start position:0%
picked up the torch and have run with it
 
01:05:29.750 --> 01:05:29.760 align:start position:0%
so White Mountains Community College
 
01:05:31.730 --> 01:05:31.740 align:start position:0%
should get some mention there they also
 
01:05:33.349 --> 01:05:33.359 align:start position:0%
provide instruction for the Vermont
 
01:05:38.089 --> 01:05:38.099 align:start position:0%
instructors as well so for their program
 
01:05:38.099 --> 01:05:42.109 align:start position:0%
instructors as well so for their program
um

01:05:42.109 --> 01:05:42.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:45.230 --> 01:05:45.240 align:start position:0%
so we the unit also completes driver's
 
01:05:47.030 --> 01:05:47.040 align:start position:0%
education documents for the for new
 
01:05:49.430 --> 01:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
students we conduct Administrative
 
01:05:52.370 --> 01:05:52.380 align:start position:0%
Hearings if we find that a school or an
 
01:05:54.289 --> 01:05:54.299 align:start position:0%
instructor is not remaining in
 
01:05:58.490 --> 01:05:58.500 align:start position:0%
compliance with the 30 3100 rules and we
 
01:06:01.190 --> 01:06:01.200 align:start position:0%
also conduct bi-annual compliance audits
 
01:06:03.289 --> 01:06:03.299 align:start position:0%
or driver license schools we try and hit
 
01:06:05.870 --> 01:06:05.880 align:start position:0%
half of the schools uh every other year
 
01:06:07.490 --> 01:06:07.500 align:start position:0%
to make sure that they're staying in
 
01:06:09.829 --> 01:06:09.839 align:start position:0%
compliance and for the most part I mean
 
01:06:11.750 --> 01:06:11.760 align:start position:0%
I'd say like 99 percent of the schools
 
01:06:15.230 --> 01:06:15.240 align:start position:0%
are staying within compliance
 
01:06:17.569 --> 01:06:17.579 align:start position:0%
the driver education curriculum is one
 
01:06:19.329 --> 01:06:19.339 align:start position:0%
of the things that we oversee
 
01:06:19.339 --> 01:06:21.250 align:start position:0%
of the things that we oversee
instructor

01:06:21.250 --> 01:06:21.260 align:start position:0%
instructor
 
01:06:23.329 --> 01:06:23.339 align:start position:0%
recertification and renewal of our
 
01:06:24.650 --> 01:06:24.660 align:start position:0%
instructors as I said we have
 
01:06:26.829 --> 01:06:26.839 align:start position:0%
approximately 160 of them
 
01:06:30.049 --> 01:06:30.059 align:start position:0%
we each of our instructors after they
 
01:06:32.829 --> 01:06:32.839 align:start position:0%
they're they're either college educated
 
01:06:35.390 --> 01:06:35.400 align:start position:0%
or they are Department of Education
 
01:06:37.549 --> 01:06:37.559 align:start position:0%
approved with their life experience so
 
01:06:40.190 --> 01:06:40.200 align:start position:0%
our educators are really
 
01:06:43.750 --> 01:06:43.760 align:start position:0%
high level Educators in the profession
 
01:06:45.890 --> 01:06:45.900 align:start position:0%
they also have to take professional
 
01:06:47.809 --> 01:06:47.819 align:start position:0%
development and have to have 51 hours
 
01:06:50.089 --> 01:06:50.099 align:start position:0%
every three years just like a teacher
 
01:06:51.589 --> 01:06:51.599 align:start position:0%
would have to have some professional
 
01:06:54.230 --> 01:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
development our driver and instructors
 
01:06:56.990 --> 01:06:57.000 align:start position:0%
also are following that requirement and
 
01:06:59.510 --> 01:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
my office actually oversees the the
 
01:07:02.089 --> 01:07:02.099 align:start position:0%
approval process for the
 
01:07:02.099 --> 01:07:02.809 align:start position:0%
approval process for the
um

01:07:02.809 --> 01:07:02.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:07.609 --> 01:07:07.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:09.710 --> 01:07:09.720 align:start position:0%
next up is Trooper first class Greg
 
01:07:11.930 --> 01:07:11.940 align:start position:0%
Hildreth uh Trooper first class class
 
01:07:14.029 --> 01:07:14.039 align:start position:0%
Hildreth oversees our Pupil
 
01:07:15.829 --> 01:07:15.839 align:start position:0%
Transportation unit and suspect he'll
 
01:07:19.010 --> 01:07:19.020 align:start position:0%
probably be in here this session as well
 
01:07:20.630 --> 01:07:20.640 align:start position:0%
warning members of the committee my name
 
01:07:22.910 --> 01:07:22.920 align:start position:0%
is Trooper first class Gregory Hildreth
 
01:07:24.950 --> 01:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
uh some of you may remember me from
 
01:07:26.809 --> 01:07:26.819 align:start position:0%
prior testimony uh I've been with the
 
01:07:29.630 --> 01:07:29.640 align:start position:0%
division of State Police 17 years I've
 
01:07:31.069 --> 01:07:31.079 align:start position:0%
been doing people transportation for
 
01:07:35.450 --> 01:07:35.460 align:start position:0%
about four years I oversee uh
 
01:07:38.150 --> 01:07:38.160 align:start position:0%
basically I'll give you a quick rundown
 
01:07:39.289 --> 01:07:39.299 align:start position:0%
on I'm also going to leave my business
 
01:07:40.849 --> 01:07:40.859 align:start position:0%
card with you guys just so if you have
 
01:07:42.109 --> 01:07:42.119 align:start position:0%
any follow-up questions you're welcome
 
01:07:44.870 --> 01:07:44.880 align:start position:0%
to reach out to me uh but there are
 
01:07:46.609 --> 01:07:46.619 align:start position:0%
about 130 school bus companies in the
 
01:07:48.650 --> 01:07:48.660 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire right now uh the
 
01:07:50.870 --> 01:07:50.880 align:start position:0%
changes monthly uh some come in some
 
01:07:52.849 --> 01:07:52.859 align:start position:0%
decide to close the doors uh but that's
 
01:07:54.049 --> 01:07:54.059 align:start position:0%
about the number of companies those
 
01:07:55.730 --> 01:07:55.740 align:start position:0%
range from large companies like first
 
01:07:59.089 --> 01:07:59.099 align:start position:0%
students stas Durham school Services I'm
 
01:08:00.349 --> 01:08:00.359 align:start position:0%
sure you've all seen those and then you
 
01:08:01.430 --> 01:08:01.440 align:start position:0%
get your smaller companies that you
 
01:08:03.829 --> 01:08:03.839 align:start position:0%
might not be familiar with uh that might
 
01:08:07.609 --> 01:08:07.619 align:start position:0%
only run one vehicle a vehicle so
 
01:08:09.710 --> 01:08:09.720 align:start position:0%
um my unit is responsible for making
 
01:08:11.270 --> 01:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
sure that those people driving those
 
01:08:13.309 --> 01:08:13.319 align:start position:0%
buses uh right now we're anywhere
 
01:08:15.650 --> 01:08:15.660 align:start position:0%
between 3000 and 3 500 we're closer to
 
01:08:18.229 --> 01:08:18.239 align:start position:0%
3200 right now for this year as far as
 
01:08:19.910 --> 01:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
drivers go but we need to conduct a
 
01:08:22.189 --> 01:08:22.199 align:start position:0%
background checks per law to making sure
 
01:08:24.289 --> 01:08:24.299 align:start position:0%
that these drivers are qualified to
 
01:08:25.789 --> 01:08:25.799 align:start position:0%
actually drive
 
01:08:28.430 --> 01:08:28.440 align:start position:0%
we also regulate and check on school bus
 
01:08:30.410 --> 01:08:30.420 align:start position:0%
accidents uh there's a regulation in the
 
01:08:33.410 --> 01:08:33.420 align:start position:0%
rules on the scfc 1300s that require any
 
01:08:35.150 --> 01:08:35.160 align:start position:0%
school bus accident regardless of how
 
01:08:37.249 --> 01:08:37.259 align:start position:0%
significant or minor to be reported to
 
01:08:39.249 --> 01:08:39.259 align:start position:0%
my office within 24 hours
 
01:08:41.570 --> 01:08:41.580 align:start position:0%
from there we decide which ones need
 
01:08:43.610 --> 01:08:43.620 align:start position:0%
follow-up which ones have been compared
 
01:08:45.229 --> 01:08:45.239 align:start position:0%
patterns you know multiple drivers
 
01:08:46.849 --> 01:08:46.859 align:start position:0%
involved in so you know a couple fender
 
01:08:48.470 --> 01:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
benders multiple times might be
 
01:08:49.789 --> 01:08:49.799 align:start position:0%
indicative of we need to look at this
 
01:08:51.590 --> 01:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
driver is it still capable safely
 
01:08:53.510 --> 01:08:53.520 align:start position:0%
driving kids
 
01:08:53.520 --> 01:08:54.289 align:start position:0%
driving kids
um

01:08:54.289 --> 01:08:54.299 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:57.110 --> 01:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
another big part of this uh job is we
 
01:09:00.110 --> 01:09:00.120 align:start position:0%
work very closely with federal agencies
 
01:09:02.030 --> 01:09:02.040 align:start position:0%
as well as Homeland Security emergency
 
01:09:04.150 --> 01:09:04.160 align:start position:0%
management hsem
 
01:09:07.490 --> 01:09:07.500 align:start position:0%
for preparing for possible issues with
 
01:09:10.130 --> 01:09:10.140 align:start position:0%
the nuclear power plant and Seabrook and
 
01:09:12.530 --> 01:09:12.540 align:start position:0%
allocation of school buses we are one
 
01:09:14.510 --> 01:09:14.520 align:start position:0%
tiny piece of a big puzzle of how do we
 
01:09:16.010 --> 01:09:16.020 align:start position:0%
handle you know if there's a
 
01:09:18.110 --> 01:09:18.120 align:start position:0%
radiological release at that power
 
01:09:20.689 --> 01:09:20.699 align:start position:0%
station my job in my office is to
 
01:09:23.209 --> 01:09:23.219 align:start position:0%
allocate buses and drivers for Mass
 
01:09:25.070 --> 01:09:25.080 align:start position:0%
evacuation of certain towns or areas
 
01:09:28.189 --> 01:09:28.199 align:start position:0%
depending on the windage we conduct four
 
01:09:29.990 --> 01:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
quarterly drills building up to one
 
01:09:32.769 --> 01:09:32.779 align:start position:0%
federally graded drill every year and
 
01:09:34.689 --> 01:09:34.699 align:start position:0%
that actually
 
01:09:36.650 --> 01:09:36.660 align:start position:0%
we're going to be having a drill I think
 
01:09:39.890 --> 01:09:39.900 align:start position:0%
that's in April is the next one but one
 
01:09:41.390 --> 01:09:41.400 align:start position:0%
of my big pushes in my department is
 
01:09:43.669 --> 01:09:43.679 align:start position:0%
actually getting school bus drivers to
 
01:09:45.110 --> 01:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
be knowledgeable and understanding of
 
01:09:46.550 --> 01:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
what we're going to be asking them to do
 
01:09:49.849 --> 01:09:49.859 align:start position:0%
in those situations so it's not
 
01:09:52.729 --> 01:09:52.739 align:start position:0%
a lot of we take a lot of the myths out
 
01:09:53.930 --> 01:09:53.940 align:start position:0%
of that to make sure we have drivers
 
01:09:55.550 --> 01:09:55.560 align:start position:0%
that actually show up
 
01:09:58.250 --> 01:09:58.260 align:start position:0%
another part of my job is audits uh we
 
01:10:00.229 --> 01:10:00.239 align:start position:0%
actually follow up it's in the role to
 
01:10:01.610 --> 01:10:01.620 align:start position:0%
follow up on actually checking the
 
01:10:03.890 --> 01:10:03.900 align:start position:0%
equipment of the buses so uh we can do
 
01:10:05.689 --> 01:10:05.699 align:start position:0%
this multiple ways through random audit
 
01:10:08.390 --> 01:10:08.400 align:start position:0%
where we just go to a location and go
 
01:10:10.790 --> 01:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
and check a specific number of random
 
01:10:13.610 --> 01:10:13.620 align:start position:0%
buses selected out of uh the fleet and
 
01:10:15.110 --> 01:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
we check the equipment on board make
 
01:10:16.250 --> 01:10:16.260 align:start position:0%
sure it's serviceable make sure there's
 
01:10:18.709 --> 01:10:18.719 align:start position:0%
no problems uh from tires to air brakes
 
01:10:20.870 --> 01:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
if they have them hydraulic brakes the
 
01:10:22.550 --> 01:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
equipment on board Medical Kit body
 
01:10:24.290 --> 01:10:24.300 align:start position:0%
fluid spill kits we just make sure that
 
01:10:26.630 --> 01:10:26.640 align:start position:0%
they are meeting the criteria we also
 
01:10:28.490 --> 01:10:28.500 align:start position:0%
audit the driver files for every single
 
01:10:29.630 --> 01:10:29.640 align:start position:0%
school bus driver in the state of New
 
01:10:31.370 --> 01:10:31.380 align:start position:0%
Hampshire there must be a driver file
 
01:10:33.110 --> 01:10:33.120 align:start position:0%
maintained at the principal location of
 
01:10:35.149 --> 01:10:35.159 align:start position:0%
business and that ensures when I open
 
01:10:37.189 --> 01:10:37.199 align:start position:0%
that up that I can find that they yep
 
01:10:39.169 --> 01:10:39.179 align:start position:0%
they are background checked if they
 
01:10:40.850 --> 01:10:40.860 align:start position:0%
require drug testing that that has been
 
01:10:42.229 --> 01:10:42.239 align:start position:0%
done that they have the proper amount of
 
01:10:44.209 --> 01:10:44.219 align:start position:0%
training hours annually it just gives me
 
01:10:45.590 --> 01:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
a quick preview to make sure this driver
 
01:10:47.149 --> 01:10:47.159 align:start position:0%
is in compliance and they belong on the
 
01:10:47.159 --> 01:10:48.229 align:start position:0%
is in compliance and they belong on the
road

01:10:48.229 --> 01:10:48.239 align:start position:0%
road
 
01:10:50.990 --> 01:10:51.000 align:start position:0%
thank you sir
 
01:10:53.270 --> 01:10:53.280 align:start position:0%
staff sergeant Huddleston oversees our
 
01:10:54.830 --> 01:10:54.840 align:start position:0%
Motor Carrier unit he was not able to be
 
01:10:57.410 --> 01:10:57.420 align:start position:0%
here today so uh Sergeant Scott Atherton
 
01:11:00.350 --> 01:11:00.360 align:start position:0%
drew the Short Straw
 
01:11:01.970 --> 01:11:01.980 align:start position:0%
good morning chairman in the committee
 
01:11:01.980 --> 01:11:05.149 align:start position:0%
good morning chairman in the committee
welcome

01:11:05.149 --> 01:11:05.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:07.310 --> 01:11:07.320 align:start position:0%
fitted in here uh my name is Sergeant
 
01:11:09.410 --> 01:11:09.420 align:start position:0%
and I've been with um department of
 
01:11:11.090 --> 01:11:11.100 align:start position:0%
safety for 21 years
 
01:11:13.790 --> 01:11:13.800 align:start position:0%
I've been assigned essentially to
 
01:11:13.800 --> 01:11:15.050 align:start position:0%
I've been assigned essentially to
um

01:11:15.050 --> 01:11:15.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:17.750 --> 01:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
the The Troop G job that we've been
 
01:11:20.990 --> 01:11:21.000 align:start position:0%
doing it used to be under the DMV as
 
01:11:22.729 --> 01:11:22.739 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle inspectors and then
 
01:11:25.010 --> 01:11:25.020 align:start position:0%
Highway Patrol so I've been lucky enough
 
01:11:26.390 --> 01:11:26.400 align:start position:0%
to have been through all the positions
 
01:11:27.590 --> 01:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
here and I've been assigned to motor
 
01:11:31.070 --> 01:11:31.080 align:start position:0%
Care Unit probably for the last 15 years
 
01:11:34.130 --> 01:11:34.140 align:start position:0%
um I also oversee the DMV task force
 
01:11:36.890 --> 01:11:36.900 align:start position:0%
which is people transportation driver's
 
01:11:39.950 --> 01:11:39.960 align:start position:0%
ed and uh CDL we have CDL task force too
 
01:11:44.990 --> 01:11:45.000 align:start position:0%
where we assist the DMV with CDL testing
 
01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:45.649 align:start position:0%
where we assist the DMV with CDL testing
um

01:11:45.649 --> 01:11:45.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:47.990 --> 01:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
they do that five days a week the DMV
 
01:11:49.669 --> 01:11:49.679 align:start position:0%
and we have a trooper that's available
 
01:11:52.189 --> 01:11:52.199 align:start position:0%
and around those sites
 
01:11:54.709 --> 01:11:54.719 align:start position:0%
every day of the week and if need be we
 
01:11:59.810 --> 01:11:59.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:02.870 --> 01:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
we also do off-site testing so if
 
01:12:04.970 --> 01:12:04.980 align:start position:0%
carriers or companies
 
01:12:07.189 --> 01:12:07.199 align:start position:0%
want to pay for a detail we'll send a
 
01:12:09.649 --> 01:12:09.659 align:start position:0%
troop route to them and they can do to
 
01:12:11.510 --> 01:12:11.520 align:start position:0%
answer your question that'll help get
 
01:12:13.070 --> 01:12:13.080 align:start position:0%
some CDL Drivers we've done a lot of
 
01:12:14.570 --> 01:12:14.580 align:start position:0%
that in the past where we will go out
 
01:12:17.270 --> 01:12:17.280 align:start position:0%
and do five or six tests for them during
 
01:12:19.910 --> 01:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
the day uh or on the weekends and they
 
01:12:21.050 --> 01:12:21.060 align:start position:0%
don't have to pull a truck out of
 
01:12:22.850 --> 01:12:22.860 align:start position:0%
service to come down here to Concord and
 
01:12:24.410 --> 01:12:24.420 align:start position:0%
whatnot so that's that's been a benefit
 
01:12:27.350 --> 01:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
in this industry as well
 
01:12:30.530 --> 01:12:30.540 align:start position:0%
um the mode of care enforcement unit we
 
01:12:34.010 --> 01:12:34.020 align:start position:0%
will oversee all the federal laws FMCSA
 
01:12:36.890 --> 01:12:36.900 align:start position:0%
Federal Motor Carrier Administration
 
01:12:38.870 --> 01:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
um they have an office right here in
 
01:12:41.410 --> 01:12:41.420 align:start position:0%
Concord we work hand in hand with them
 
01:12:43.669 --> 01:12:43.679 align:start position:0%
through grants and funding to try and
 
01:12:45.590 --> 01:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
get extra money to get extra patrols out
 
01:12:49.430 --> 01:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
there to enforce motor carer stops in
 
01:12:51.530 --> 01:12:51.540 align:start position:0%
and try and keep trash reductions down
 
01:12:54.530 --> 01:12:54.540 align:start position:0%
with those as well we have
 
01:12:57.169 --> 01:12:57.179 align:start position:0%
just under 30 Troopers trained
 
01:12:58.850 --> 01:12:58.860 align:start position:0%
through the Federal Motor Carrier to do
 
01:13:01.130 --> 01:13:01.140 align:start position:0%
these inspections on these trucks
 
01:13:01.140 --> 01:13:02.149 align:start position:0%
these inspections on these trucks
um

01:13:02.149 --> 01:13:02.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:04.310 --> 01:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
we we have the capability of placing
 
01:13:06.530 --> 01:13:06.540 align:start position:0%
drivers and vehicles out of service we
 
01:13:08.689 --> 01:13:08.699 align:start position:0%
also are the only ones in the state that
 
01:13:10.729 --> 01:13:10.739 align:start position:0%
can stop these trucks without any
 
01:13:13.250 --> 01:13:13.260 align:start position:0%
articulable suspicion or probable cause
 
01:13:15.950 --> 01:13:15.960 align:start position:0%
we can just stop them to do a routine
 
01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:18.770 align:start position:0%
we can just stop them to do a routine
inspection

01:13:18.770 --> 01:13:18.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:21.770 --> 01:13:21.780 align:start position:0%
um we also have those multiple
 
01:13:23.570 --> 01:13:23.580 align:start position:0%
um Troopers trained in doing weight
 
01:13:25.910 --> 01:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
enforcement uh where they assigned
 
01:13:27.830 --> 01:13:27.840 align:start position:0%
portable scale so they can they can pull
 
01:13:29.689 --> 01:13:29.699 align:start position:0%
those out and they're they're less than
 
01:13:31.010 --> 01:13:31.020 align:start position:0%
an inch thick and they can slide those
 
01:13:33.050 --> 01:13:33.060 align:start position:0%
underneath the tires of these trucks and
 
01:13:35.630 --> 01:13:35.640 align:start position:0%
do weights roadside we also have semi
 
01:13:37.430 --> 01:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
Portables that
 
01:13:38.689 --> 01:13:38.699 align:start position:0%
um I think we have three or four of
 
01:13:40.130 --> 01:13:40.140 align:start position:0%
those that will set up at different
 
01:13:42.169 --> 01:13:42.179 align:start position:0%
locations throughout the state where we
 
01:13:43.550 --> 01:13:43.560 align:start position:0%
can pull multiple trucks over those
 
01:13:44.990 --> 01:13:45.000 align:start position:0%
during the day and save a little bit of
 
01:13:47.450 --> 01:13:47.460 align:start position:0%
time with that as well as our fixed
 
01:13:49.010 --> 01:13:49.020 align:start position:0%
scales that we have down at Windham on
 
01:13:51.290 --> 01:13:51.300 align:start position:0%
both the North and southbound side
 
01:13:51.300 --> 01:13:52.130 align:start position:0%
both the North and southbound side
um

01:13:52.130 --> 01:13:52.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:54.470 --> 01:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
we're trying to get some what they call
 
01:13:56.330 --> 01:13:56.340 align:start position:0%
weigh in motion scales that we can put
 
01:13:58.189 --> 01:13:58.199 align:start position:0%
we've been working with DOT to try and
 
01:14:00.410 --> 01:14:00.420 align:start position:0%
get these that we can put into the
 
01:14:02.870 --> 01:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
pavement and Troopers that can be nearby
 
01:14:05.990 --> 01:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
can get a rough readout if a truck may
 
01:14:08.390 --> 01:14:08.400 align:start position:0%
be overloaded that way not wasting the
 
01:14:10.370 --> 01:14:10.380 align:start position:0%
truck's time for stopping them and
 
01:14:11.270 --> 01:14:11.280 align:start position:0%
weighing them when they're not
 
01:14:14.209 --> 01:14:14.219 align:start position:0%
overweight and the trooper's time wait
 
01:14:15.709 --> 01:14:15.719 align:start position:0%
because we do we'll wait trucks and they
 
01:14:17.090 --> 01:14:17.100 align:start position:0%
won't always be overweight we just try
 
01:14:19.250 --> 01:14:19.260 align:start position:0%
and judge them so hopefully that's
 
01:14:20.450 --> 01:14:20.460 align:start position:0%
something coming down the road that
 
01:14:21.950 --> 01:14:21.960 align:start position:0%
we'll be able to offer to the state and
 
01:14:24.590 --> 01:14:24.600 align:start position:0%
it'll save some time for industry as
 
01:14:27.410 --> 01:14:27.420 align:start position:0%
well we also assist
 
01:14:30.169 --> 01:14:30.179 align:start position:0%
um other agencies our Troopers with
 
01:14:31.729 --> 01:14:31.739 align:start position:0%
crashes involving commercial Motor
 
01:14:34.550 --> 01:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
Vehicles so if a local Town gets a bus
 
01:14:36.890 --> 01:14:36.900 align:start position:0%
crash or a truck crash a lot of times
 
01:14:38.390 --> 01:14:38.400 align:start position:0%
they'll reach out to Troop G For
 
01:14:40.310 --> 01:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
assistance with those
 
01:14:41.870 --> 01:14:41.880 align:start position:0%
um and we will go out and take care of
 
01:14:44.390 --> 01:14:44.400 align:start position:0%
the motive motor care inspection side of
 
01:14:45.530 --> 01:14:45.540 align:start position:0%
that so they don't have to deal with
 
01:14:45.540 --> 01:14:48.649 align:start position:0%
that so they don't have to deal with
that

01:14:48.649 --> 01:14:48.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:52.490 --> 01:14:52.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:53.810 --> 01:14:53.820 align:start position:0%
so there's three different weight
 
01:14:57.350 --> 01:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
enforcement laws that we um
 
01:15:00.709 --> 01:15:00.719 align:start position:0%
we enforce obviously the highway the
 
01:15:04.310 --> 01:15:04.320 align:start position:0%
interstate highway systems we 93 89 95
 
01:15:06.410 --> 01:15:06.420 align:start position:0%
there's a certain law for that it's a
 
01:15:09.229 --> 01:15:09.239 align:start position:0%
flat fee out there for those and then we
 
01:15:12.470 --> 01:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
do the non-interstate roads Route 3 104
 
01:15:14.810 --> 01:15:14.820 align:start position:0%
all the non-interstates and those those
 
01:15:16.729 --> 01:15:16.739 align:start position:0%
side roads and non-interestate roads are
 
01:15:19.550 --> 01:15:19.560 align:start position:0%
two cents a pound so the fines can be a
 
01:15:20.870 --> 01:15:20.880 align:start position:0%
little more steeper on those roads
 
01:15:24.410 --> 01:15:24.420 align:start position:0%
compared to the highway and also the
 
01:15:26.270 --> 01:15:26.280 align:start position:0%
additional weight so a lot of these
 
01:15:27.950 --> 01:15:27.960 align:start position:0%
trucking companies can register for
 
01:15:30.770 --> 01:15:30.780 align:start position:0%
additional weights uh which will make
 
01:15:33.590 --> 01:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
them haul they'll build a hall heavier
 
01:15:35.270 --> 01:15:35.280 align:start position:0%
um and we have more of a leeway there
 
01:15:37.130 --> 01:15:37.140 align:start position:0%
with um their weights but if they're not
 
01:15:39.410 --> 01:15:39.420 align:start position:0%
certified we'll go back to the
 
01:15:41.450 --> 01:15:41.460 align:start position:0%
non-interstate and the interstate laws
 
01:15:41.460 --> 01:15:42.229 align:start position:0%
non-interstate and the interstate laws
so

01:15:42.229 --> 01:15:42.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:15:43.669 --> 01:15:43.679 align:start position:0%
that's what we do with that we also have
 
01:15:45.110 --> 01:15:45.120 align:start position:0%
a new entrant
 
01:15:48.050 --> 01:15:48.060 align:start position:0%
group I think we have three true one
 
01:15:50.510 --> 01:15:50.520 align:start position:0%
full-time and two auxiliary Troopers
 
01:15:52.070 --> 01:15:52.080 align:start position:0%
assigned to that
 
01:15:53.810 --> 01:15:53.820 align:start position:0%
they're responsible with working hand in
 
01:15:55.130 --> 01:15:55.140 align:start position:0%
hand with the feds while they'll go out
 
01:15:57.169 --> 01:15:57.179 align:start position:0%
and audit companies make sure their
 
01:15:59.330 --> 01:15:59.340 align:start position:0%
books and all their driver files are
 
01:16:01.729 --> 01:16:01.739 align:start position:0%
kept like they should be
 
01:16:05.209 --> 01:16:05.219 align:start position:0%
um it takes a lot of time and it's a lot
 
01:16:07.669 --> 01:16:07.679 align:start position:0%
of one-on-one with the company that new
 
01:16:10.250 --> 01:16:10.260 align:start position:0%
intern group also offers a course the
 
01:16:12.350 --> 01:16:12.360 align:start position:0%
first Thursday of every month it's free
 
01:16:14.030 --> 01:16:14.040 align:start position:0%
I think they hold it at the department
 
01:16:16.149 --> 01:16:16.159 align:start position:0%
of safety sometimes a DMV if needed
 
01:16:19.490 --> 01:16:19.500 align:start position:0%
where industry can come to us and we'll
 
01:16:21.050 --> 01:16:21.060 align:start position:0%
kind of they can ask questions we kind
 
01:16:23.570 --> 01:16:23.580 align:start position:0%
of go through a PowerPoint to try and
 
01:16:25.070 --> 01:16:25.080 align:start position:0%
help them because a lot of these new
 
01:16:27.350 --> 01:16:27.360 align:start position:0%
industries that might be smaller they
 
01:16:28.430 --> 01:16:28.440 align:start position:0%
might not know what's their
 
01:16:29.990 --> 01:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
responsibility as far as the federal
 
01:16:32.030 --> 01:16:32.040 align:start position:0%
guidelines so we do that to first
 
01:16:34.729 --> 01:16:34.739 align:start position:0%
Thursday of every every month for them
 
01:16:36.950 --> 01:16:36.960 align:start position:0%
and that's a brief overview of what we
 
01:16:38.450 --> 01:16:38.460 align:start position:0%
do at Troop G does anybody have any
 
01:16:38.460 --> 01:16:40.610 align:start position:0%
do at Troop G does anybody have any
questions

so um I mentioned the the structure so
 
01:30:27.950 --> 01:30:27.960 align:start position:0%
this this page the the fine over over
 
01:30:29.270 --> 01:30:29.280 align:start position:0%
um gives an overview of the five
 
01:30:32.030 --> 01:30:32.040 align:start position:0%
divisions within the department and
 
01:30:33.410 --> 01:30:33.420 align:start position:0%
typically the assistant commissioner
 
01:30:33.420 --> 01:30:34.790 align:start position:0%
typically the assistant commissioner
Dave

01:30:34.790 --> 01:30:34.800 align:start position:0%
Dave
 
01:30:37.189 --> 01:30:37.199 align:start position:0%
um pretty much oversees the operations
 
01:30:39.050 --> 01:30:39.060 align:start position:0%
side of the house so that's project
 
01:30:41.030 --> 01:30:41.040 align:start position:0%
development which are the seven bureaus
 
01:30:44.390 --> 01:30:44.400 align:start position:0%
that are uh involved in developing the
 
01:30:47.870 --> 01:30:47.880 align:start position:0%
uh the federal program
 
01:30:50.570 --> 01:30:50.580 align:start position:0%
um as well as the Operations Division
 
01:30:53.270 --> 01:30:53.280 align:start position:0%
which is responsible for all of the
 
01:30:56.510 --> 01:30:56.520 align:start position:0%
um uh operations and maintenance of of
 
01:30:59.209 --> 01:30:59.219 align:start position:0%
Highways Bridges traffic signals
 
01:31:00.649 --> 01:31:00.659 align:start position:0%
everything else and we'll get into a
 
01:31:03.229 --> 01:31:03.239 align:start position:0%
little bit of detail by each division
 
01:31:06.590 --> 01:31:06.600 align:start position:0%
on the other side of the house which
 
01:31:08.390 --> 01:31:08.400 align:start position:0%
generally rolls up and reports to the
 
01:31:11.270 --> 01:31:11.280 align:start position:0%
Deputy Commissioner we have our division
 
01:31:14.870 --> 01:31:14.880 align:start position:0%
of finance which oversees all of the um
 
01:31:17.450 --> 01:31:17.460 align:start position:0%
Financial operations policy
 
01:31:19.550 --> 01:31:19.560 align:start position:0%
Administration which is some of our
 
01:31:24.250 --> 01:31:24.260 align:start position:0%
labor compliance and HR as well as the
 
01:31:26.990 --> 01:31:27.000 align:start position:0%
non-highway in Bridge Transportation
 
01:31:30.530 --> 01:31:30.540 align:start position:0%
facilities of Aeronautics railroads and
 
01:31:32.270 --> 01:31:32.280 align:start position:0%
public transportation
 
01:31:34.550 --> 01:31:34.560 align:start position:0%
so that at a snapshot is just generally
 
01:31:37.610 --> 01:31:37.620 align:start position:0%
how where how we're structured
 
01:31:41.450 --> 01:31:41.460 align:start position:0%
um on the next slide slide four just a
 
01:31:44.629 --> 01:31:44.639 align:start position:0%
few facts and figures about the D.O.T
 
01:31:47.510 --> 01:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
um we're staffed with about 1650
 
01:31:49.850 --> 01:31:49.860 align:start position:0%
permanent positions and I say permanent
 
01:31:52.149 --> 01:31:52.159 align:start position:0%
positions because we have a
 
01:31:54.830 --> 01:31:54.840 align:start position:0%
large number of vacancies currently
 
01:31:57.290 --> 01:31:57.300 align:start position:0%
which I'll speak to in a uh toward the
 
01:31:58.910 --> 01:31:58.920 align:start position:0%
end of the presentation
 
01:32:01.370 --> 01:32:01.380 align:start position:0%
we're responsible for overseeing and
 
01:32:03.169 --> 01:32:03.179 align:start position:0%
maintaining about
 
01:32:03.179 --> 01:32:05.950 align:start position:0%
maintaining about
um

01:32:05.950 --> 01:32:05.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:11.510 --> 01:32:11.520 align:start position:0%
2159 State Bridges uh and uh we are
 
01:32:14.270 --> 01:32:14.280 align:start position:0%
responsible for inspecting uh close to
 
01:32:17.330 --> 01:32:17.340 align:start position:0%
1700 Municipal Bridges so all of the
 
01:32:19.790 --> 01:32:19.800 align:start position:0%
bridges in the State uh the dot is
 
01:32:21.649 --> 01:32:21.659 align:start position:0%
responsible for inspecting and seeing
 
01:32:23.810 --> 01:32:23.820 align:start position:0%
that they're safe and they uh we inspect
 
01:32:26.709 --> 01:32:26.719 align:start position:0%
every bridge every two years
 
01:32:29.629 --> 01:32:29.639 align:start position:0%
redless Bridges which are structurally
 
01:32:32.390 --> 01:32:32.400 align:start position:0%
deficient Bridges we inspect every six
 
01:32:33.709 --> 01:32:33.719 align:start position:0%
months to ensure that they're not
 
01:32:37.010 --> 01:32:37.020 align:start position:0%
deteriorating more rapidly and they are
 
01:32:40.610 --> 01:32:40.620 align:start position:0%
kept safe safety is our number one
 
01:32:40.620 --> 01:32:42.890 align:start position:0%
kept safe safety is our number one
objective

01:32:42.890 --> 01:32:42.900 align:start position:0%
objective
 
01:32:47.689 --> 01:32:47.699 align:start position:0%
we also maintain uh about 4 600 sunline
 
01:32:49.310 --> 01:32:49.320 align:start position:0%
miles of roadway
 
01:32:52.850 --> 01:32:52.860 align:start position:0%
there are now the 300 miles of town
 
01:32:54.410 --> 01:32:54.420 align:start position:0%
maintained roads so those are state
 
01:32:56.810 --> 01:32:56.820 align:start position:0%
roads that are on our books as summer
 
01:32:59.330 --> 01:32:59.340 align:start position:0%
maintenance but they are uh maintained
 
01:33:01.370 --> 01:33:01.380 align:start position:0%
by cities and towns during the winter
 
01:33:04.129 --> 01:33:04.139 align:start position:0%
for plowing a lot of those are uh the
 
01:33:06.890 --> 01:33:06.900 align:start position:0%
tier four unnumbered state roads things
 
01:33:08.050 --> 01:33:08.060 align:start position:0%
like that
 
01:33:11.209 --> 01:33:11.219 align:start position:0%
our program tries to maintain a Paving
 
01:33:14.510 --> 01:33:14.520 align:start position:0%
cycle of about every 500 about five
 
01:33:16.910 --> 01:33:16.920 align:start position:0%
about once every 10 years a section of
 
01:33:18.770 --> 01:33:18.780 align:start position:0%
roadways should get some some sort of
 
01:33:21.350 --> 01:33:21.360 align:start position:0%
preventative maintenance treatment we
 
01:33:24.470 --> 01:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
try to pave about 500 to 550 miles per
 
01:33:27.050 --> 01:33:27.060 align:start position:0%
year to keep up with that
 
01:33:29.510 --> 01:33:29.520 align:start position:0%
um in addition to the miles of pavement
 
01:33:31.790 --> 01:33:31.800 align:start position:0%
we maintain about a hundred thousand
 
01:33:33.229 --> 01:33:33.239 align:start position:0%
highway signs
 
01:33:36.290 --> 01:33:36.300 align:start position:0%
68 million feet of striping our goal is
 
01:33:38.330 --> 01:33:38.340 align:start position:0%
to stripe every road
 
01:33:41.149 --> 01:33:41.159 align:start position:0%
um in in the state once a year
 
01:33:41.159 --> 01:33:41.990 align:start position:0%
um in in the state once a year
um

01:33:41.990 --> 01:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:44.810 --> 01:33:44.820 align:start position:0%
we have uh
 
01:33:46.850 --> 01:33:46.860 align:start position:0%
we have not achieved that goal most most
 
01:33:50.030 --> 01:33:50.040 align:start position:0%
recently but it still is our objective
 
01:33:51.950 --> 01:33:51.960 align:start position:0%
um and we concentrate obviously on
 
01:33:53.689 --> 01:33:53.699 align:start position:0%
getting the higher volume roads done
 
01:33:53.699 --> 01:33:54.649 align:start position:0%
getting the higher volume roads done
first

01:33:54.649 --> 01:33:54.659 align:start position:0%
first
 
01:33:57.770 --> 01:33:57.780 align:start position:0%
we maintain 440 traffic signals about
 
01:34:00.490 --> 01:34:00.500 align:start position:0%
550 traffic beacons
 
01:34:04.669 --> 01:34:04.679 align:start position:0%
we have 194 miles of active state-owned
 
01:34:07.850 --> 01:34:07.860 align:start position:0%
Rail lines that we administer 25
 
01:34:10.629 --> 01:34:10.639 align:start position:0%
publicly accessible airports and 11
 
01:34:14.030 --> 01:34:14.040 align:start position:0%
local public transit systems that we
 
01:34:17.570 --> 01:34:17.580 align:start position:0%
help oversee and the
 
01:34:19.910 --> 01:34:19.920 align:start position:0%
conduit for all of the federal funding
 
01:34:24.110 --> 01:34:24.120 align:start position:0%
that goes to support those
 
01:34:26.450 --> 01:34:26.460 align:start position:0%
so those are some just high-level facts
 
01:34:28.310 --> 01:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
and figures of just the general size and
 
01:34:30.610 --> 01:34:30.620 align:start position:0%
scope of the dots purview
 
01:34:33.410 --> 01:34:33.420 align:start position:0%
the budgetary scope
 
01:34:35.930 --> 01:34:35.940 align:start position:0%
um slide six just gives a snapshot of
 
01:34:35.940 --> 01:34:37.510 align:start position:0%
um slide six just gives a snapshot of
our

01:34:37.510 --> 01:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:34:41.750 --> 01:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
approximately of our budget in FY 2022
 
01:34:43.910 --> 01:34:43.920 align:start position:0%
actual expenders were actual
 
01:34:46.189 --> 01:34:46.199 align:start position:0%
expenditures were close to 600 million
 
01:34:46.199 --> 01:34:47.149 align:start position:0%
expenditures were close to 600 million
dollars

01:34:47.149 --> 01:34:47.159 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:34:49.790 --> 01:34:49.800 align:start position:0%
we tend to break our budget up in
 
01:34:52.310 --> 01:34:52.320 align:start position:0%
talking about it into two sides of the
 
01:34:54.709 --> 01:34:54.719 align:start position:0%
budget so a lot of funding gets
 
01:34:57.610 --> 01:34:57.620 align:start position:0%
channeled through the dot that goes to
 
01:35:00.709 --> 01:35:00.719 align:start position:0%
you know a construction program and
 
01:35:04.189 --> 01:35:04.199 align:start position:0%
Municipal Aid to cities and towns so of
 
01:35:06.890 --> 01:35:06.900 align:start position:0%
that 600 approximately 600 million
 
01:35:09.530 --> 01:35:09.540 align:start position:0%
dollar expenditures about 305 million
 
01:35:12.290 --> 01:35:12.300 align:start position:0%
had gone out to construction projects or
 
01:35:15.350 --> 01:35:15.360 align:start position:0%
to support for cities and towns our
 
01:35:16.970 --> 01:35:16.980 align:start position:0%
operating budget
 
01:35:16.980 --> 01:35:17.689 align:start position:0%
operating budget
um

01:35:17.689 --> 01:35:17.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:21.590 --> 01:35:21.600 align:start position:0%
was about 282 million dollars so that
 
01:35:24.169 --> 01:35:24.179 align:start position:0%
roughly the two main parts of our budget
 
01:35:25.910 --> 01:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
and how we um
 
01:35:28.490 --> 01:35:28.500 align:start position:0%
how we separate those
 
01:35:31.729 --> 01:35:31.739 align:start position:0%
and um I won't get into the details here
 
01:35:34.610 --> 01:35:34.620 align:start position:0%
other times we've done presentations
 
01:35:37.129 --> 01:35:37.139 align:start position:0%
um primarily when we talk about 10-year
 
01:35:40.250 --> 01:35:40.260 align:start position:0%
plan and things like that about the
 
01:35:42.649 --> 01:35:42.659 align:start position:0%
varied uh sources of funding that go
 
01:35:44.510 --> 01:35:44.520 align:start position:0%
into supporting the dot but we are
 
01:35:47.629 --> 01:35:47.639 align:start position:0%
supported by Highway funds federal funds
 
01:35:51.050 --> 01:35:51.060 align:start position:0%
Turnpike funds other funds and a
 
01:35:52.850 --> 01:35:52.860 align:start position:0%
relatively small percentage of of
 
01:35:55.129 --> 01:35:55.139 align:start position:0%
General funds we'll touch on that a
 
01:35:56.570 --> 01:35:56.580 align:start position:0%
little bit and if we have more questions
 
01:35:58.790 --> 01:35:58.800 align:start position:0%
we can answer that
 
01:36:01.070 --> 01:36:01.080 align:start position:0%
so that's a high level overview of some
 
01:36:04.370 --> 01:36:04.380 align:start position:0%
of the nuts and bolts what I'll do now
 
01:36:06.709 --> 01:36:06.719 align:start position:0%
is I'll ask Andre to just kind of Step
 
01:36:08.810 --> 01:36:08.820 align:start position:0%
through with some of the
 
01:36:08.820 --> 01:36:09.649 align:start position:0%
through with some of the
um

01:36:09.649 --> 01:36:09.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:11.990 --> 01:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
UH responsibilities under his purview
 
01:36:14.570 --> 01:36:14.580 align:start position:0%
and then I'll have Dave go through the
 
01:36:16.550 --> 01:36:16.560 align:start position:0%
same with with uh with his bureaus as
 
01:36:21.770 --> 01:36:21.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:23.870 --> 01:36:23.880 align:start position:0%
thank you commissioner
 
01:36:26.149 --> 01:36:26.159 align:start position:0%
morning uh chairman members of the
 
01:36:28.310 --> 01:36:28.320 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Andre Brier just by
 
01:36:30.590 --> 01:36:30.600 align:start position:0%
a brief background I spent most of my
 
01:36:33.050 --> 01:36:33.060 align:start position:0%
career as a as an Air Force pilot
 
01:36:35.110 --> 01:36:35.120 align:start position:0%
retired Colonel type
 
01:36:37.550 --> 01:36:37.560 align:start position:0%
was a transportation official on the
 
01:36:39.950 --> 01:36:39.960 align:start position:0%
federal side then came into this job and
 
01:36:42.709 --> 01:36:42.719 align:start position:0%
everybody congratulates commissioner
 
01:36:45.290 --> 01:36:45.300 align:start position:0%
Cass and assistant commissioner rodrigue
 
01:36:47.090 --> 01:36:47.100 align:start position:0%
I feel like I should be the one getting
 
01:36:48.530 --> 01:36:48.540 align:start position:0%
congratulations because I get to work
 
01:36:50.450 --> 01:36:50.460 align:start position:0%
with them it's really a pleasure we have
 
01:36:52.970 --> 01:36:52.980 align:start position:0%
a really good team that that we've
 
01:36:55.729 --> 01:36:55.739 align:start position:0%
formed on the Aeronautics side as the
 
01:36:58.850 --> 01:36:58.860 align:start position:0%
commissioner said we have 25 open to the
 
01:37:02.090 --> 01:37:02.100 align:start position:0%
public airports these are really uh as
 
01:37:04.129 --> 01:37:04.139 align:start position:0%
many of you know who that have airports
 
01:37:05.450 --> 01:37:05.460 align:start position:0%
in your districts these are these are
 
01:37:07.010 --> 01:37:07.020 align:start position:0%
Transportation assets they're also
 
01:37:08.990 --> 01:37:09.000 align:start position:0%
economic gateways into those communities
 
01:37:11.390 --> 01:37:11.400 align:start position:0%
their search and rescue assets their
 
01:37:14.570 --> 01:37:14.580 align:start position:0%
Homeland Security assets and and most of
 
01:37:17.090 --> 01:37:17.100 align:start position:0%
all dearest my heart they're also
 
01:37:19.610 --> 01:37:19.620 align:start position:0%
education assets because these are the
 
01:37:21.350 --> 01:37:21.360 align:start position:0%
places we we've we hear about a
 
01:37:22.970 --> 01:37:22.980 align:start position:0%
nationwide pilot shortage that's coming
 
01:37:24.530 --> 01:37:24.540 align:start position:0%
as the Vietnam
 
01:37:27.770 --> 01:37:27.780 align:start position:0%
um era of Pilots finally finally leaves
 
01:37:30.890 --> 01:37:30.900 align:start position:0%
the industry this is where we grow our
 
01:37:33.709 --> 01:37:33.719 align:start position:0%
new pilots and we our goal is to keep
 
01:37:36.350 --> 01:37:36.360 align:start position:0%
every one of these airports vibrant and
 
01:37:39.229 --> 01:37:39.239 align:start position:0%
uh and active
 
01:37:42.229 --> 01:37:42.239 align:start position:0%
um we mostly operate as a pass-through
 
01:37:44.629 --> 01:37:44.639 align:start position:0%
for the Federal grant money we dispensed
 
01:37:47.870 --> 01:37:47.880 align:start position:0%
about 46 million uh last fiscal year we
 
01:37:50.209 --> 01:37:50.219 align:start position:0%
are one of 10 block grant States what
 
01:37:53.510 --> 01:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
that means is that 10 states around the
 
01:37:55.910 --> 01:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
country have have been designated and
 
01:37:59.090 --> 01:37:59.100 align:start position:0%
signed up to have increased authority to
 
01:38:03.470 --> 01:38:03.480 align:start position:0%
act as a proxy for the FAA gives us a
 
01:38:06.169 --> 01:38:06.179 align:start position:0%
little uh more flexibility in our grants
 
01:38:09.709 --> 01:38:09.719 align:start position:0%
and also lets us engage with FAA at a
 
01:38:12.050 --> 01:38:12.060 align:start position:0%
slightly higher level than states that
 
01:38:14.930 --> 01:38:14.940 align:start position:0%
that aren't part of the block grant and
 
01:38:16.550 --> 01:38:16.560 align:start position:0%
that's something we're happy to discuss
 
01:38:19.129 --> 01:38:19.139 align:start position:0%
in more detail if any of you are more or
 
01:38:22.490 --> 01:38:22.500 align:start position:0%
uh would like more information on it we
 
01:38:26.510 --> 01:38:26.520 align:start position:0%
get about 400 plus thousand dollars in
 
01:38:29.209 --> 01:38:29.219 align:start position:0%
Revenue uh every year from Aviation
 
01:38:31.129 --> 01:38:31.139 align:start position:0%
registration fees generally that's
 
01:38:33.590 --> 01:38:33.600 align:start position:0%
plowed right back into the system to
 
01:38:35.450 --> 01:38:35.460 align:start position:0%
keep our non-federally funded airports
 
01:38:38.570 --> 01:38:38.580 align:start position:0%
viable work on projects Etc the one one
 
01:38:39.950 --> 01:38:39.960 align:start position:0%
thing the one capability you don't see
 
01:38:42.530 --> 01:38:42.540 align:start position:0%
in this Aeronautics section we were also
 
01:38:45.050 --> 01:38:45.060 align:start position:0%
privileged earlier in the spring to
 
01:38:46.790 --> 01:38:46.800 align:start position:0%
brief the governor and executive Council
 
01:38:50.209 --> 01:38:50.219 align:start position:0%
on our growing uas capability that's
 
01:38:53.750 --> 01:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
that's the drones uas we at dot don't
 
01:38:55.850 --> 01:38:55.860 align:start position:0%
take pictures people we take pictures of
 
01:39:00.050 --> 01:39:00.060 align:start position:0%
things so this is runways roads it's a
 
01:39:03.350 --> 01:39:03.360 align:start position:0%
great emergency response asset for us if
 
01:39:05.270 --> 01:39:05.280 align:start position:0%
we're you know if a significant event
 
01:39:07.669 --> 01:39:07.679 align:start position:0%
happens on our highway system or our
 
01:39:09.229 --> 01:39:09.239 align:start position:0%
airports are as we're constructing
 
01:39:11.450 --> 01:39:11.460 align:start position:0%
things this is a much cheaper more
 
01:39:14.810 --> 01:39:14.820 align:start position:0%
effective way for us to uh to get that
 
01:39:17.030 --> 01:39:17.040 align:start position:0%
capability versus Contracting it out so
 
01:39:19.370 --> 01:39:19.380 align:start position:0%
we're very proud of that capability and
 
01:39:22.430 --> 01:39:22.440 align:start position:0%
and that is growing but we do have a
 
01:39:25.790 --> 01:39:25.800 align:start position:0%
wonderful briefing given by our uh our
 
01:39:27.530 --> 01:39:27.540 align:start position:0%
great Aviation team if any of you is
 
01:39:28.910 --> 01:39:28.920 align:start position:0%
interested in getting that we're happy
 
01:39:31.370 --> 01:39:31.380 align:start position:0%
to come one-on-one or as a group to
 
01:39:32.750 --> 01:39:32.760 align:start position:0%
present that to you
 
01:39:35.090 --> 01:39:35.100 align:start position:0%
on the rail side we do have six Active
 
01:39:37.129 --> 01:39:37.139 align:start position:0%
operator agreements as commissioner Cass
 
01:39:40.729 --> 01:39:40.739 align:start position:0%
also said it's about 194 miles of
 
01:39:43.129 --> 01:39:43.139 align:start position:0%
state-owned rail line
 
01:39:44.890 --> 01:39:44.900 align:start position:0%
um we also have
 
01:39:48.470 --> 01:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
333 inactive miles of rail line what we
 
01:39:50.330 --> 01:39:50.340 align:start position:0%
do with that we're trying to be creative
 
01:39:53.270 --> 01:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
at all times we have a couple of uh of
 
01:39:55.729 --> 01:39:55.739 align:start position:0%
tourist railroads as you know
 
01:39:57.830 --> 01:39:57.840 align:start position:0%
along with four freight services that we
 
01:40:01.430 --> 01:40:01.440 align:start position:0%
contract out for we're always looking
 
01:40:04.610 --> 01:40:04.620 align:start position:0%
for uh for things to do with those
 
01:40:07.790 --> 01:40:07.800 align:start position:0%
inactive miles in order to preserve it
 
01:40:09.649 --> 01:40:09.659 align:start position:0%
for potential future use but also make
 
01:40:11.450 --> 01:40:11.460 align:start position:0%
sure the citizens of New Hampshire get
 
01:40:13.910 --> 01:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
the most use out of it some of them that
 
01:40:16.270 --> 01:40:16.280 align:start position:0%
you're probably aware of are rail Trails
 
01:40:19.850 --> 01:40:19.860 align:start position:0%
some other are kind of the rail bikes
 
01:40:22.310 --> 01:40:22.320 align:start position:0%
you see in certain services around the
 
01:40:23.930 --> 01:40:23.940 align:start position:0%
state we're growing that capability as
 
01:40:26.870 --> 01:40:26.880 align:start position:0%
well just so they can use that line
 
01:40:29.750 --> 01:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
um we just completed a rail trail plan
 
01:40:31.729 --> 01:40:31.739 align:start position:0%
in cooperation with our other colleagues
 
01:40:33.649 --> 01:40:33.659 align:start position:0%
throughout state government that will be
 
01:40:36.530 --> 01:40:36.540 align:start position:0%
forthcoming and and also provided to you
 
01:40:38.990 --> 01:40:39.000 align:start position:0%
in the in the coming weeks
 
01:40:41.870 --> 01:40:41.880 align:start position:0%
on the public transit side we have 11 uh
 
01:40:45.050 --> 01:40:45.060 align:start position:0%
local public transit providers
 
01:40:47.990 --> 01:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
um as you're aware the uh the event
 
01:40:50.149 --> 01:40:50.159 align:start position:0%
since 2020 did have an impact on
 
01:40:52.189 --> 01:40:52.199 align:start position:0%
ridership evolving commuting patterns
 
01:40:54.290 --> 01:40:54.300 align:start position:0%
we're still tracking that
 
01:40:57.470 --> 01:40:57.480 align:start position:0%
um generally speaking we see a steady
 
01:40:59.470 --> 01:40:59.480 align:start position:0%
increase in ridership
 
01:41:03.350 --> 01:41:03.360 align:start position:0%
not quite at pre-2020 levels but we're
 
01:41:06.410 --> 01:41:06.420 align:start position:0%
getting there what you do see uh in just
 
01:41:08.390 --> 01:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
about every municipality around the
 
01:41:10.250 --> 01:41:10.260 align:start position:0%
state and around the country are
 
01:41:12.290 --> 01:41:12.300 align:start position:0%
slightly different uh return to work
 
01:41:14.870 --> 01:41:14.880 align:start position:0%
patterns uh in the Greater Boston area
 
01:41:18.350 --> 01:41:18.360 align:start position:0%
you do see concentrated uh increases
 
01:41:21.050 --> 01:41:21.060 align:start position:0%
almost to 2020 levels in the Tuesday
 
01:41:23.750 --> 01:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
through Thursday time frame
 
01:41:25.970 --> 01:41:25.980 align:start position:0%
um but that's evolving we have our eye
 
01:41:28.370 --> 01:41:28.380 align:start position:0%
on it and we have great Partnerships
 
01:41:32.350 --> 01:41:32.360 align:start position:0%
with our public transit uh providers
 
01:41:36.790 --> 01:41:36.800 align:start position:0%
we're also really expanding into the
 
01:41:39.890 --> 01:41:39.900 align:start position:0%
on-demand service for our elderly and
 
01:41:41.570 --> 01:41:41.580 align:start position:0%
people with disabilities around the
 
01:41:43.910 --> 01:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
state we've recently uh not recently I
 
01:41:45.790 --> 01:41:45.800 align:start position:0%
guess it's it's it's over a year now
 
01:41:49.729 --> 01:41:49.739 align:start position:0%
hired Mobility managers to further
 
01:41:52.010 --> 01:41:52.020 align:start position:0%
streamline and integrate all those
 
01:41:54.770 --> 01:41:54.780 align:start position:0%
wonderful options that our seniors and
 
01:41:56.750 --> 01:41:56.760 align:start position:0%
people with disability can access to
 
01:41:58.970 --> 01:41:58.980 align:start position:0%
give them easier One-Stop service when
 
01:42:01.070 --> 01:42:01.080 align:start position:0%
they need a ride whether that's to
 
01:42:02.689 --> 01:42:02.699 align:start position:0%
groceries medical appointments anything
 
01:42:04.970 --> 01:42:04.980 align:start position:0%
like that to make sure we keep those
 
01:42:06.830 --> 01:42:06.840 align:start position:0%
communities connected and that's our
 
01:42:06.840 --> 01:42:08.450 align:start position:0%
communities connected and that's our
goal

01:42:08.450 --> 01:42:08.460 align:start position:0%
goal
 
01:42:11.209 --> 01:42:11.219 align:start position:0%
so that's my Aviation Rail and Transit
 
01:42:13.850 --> 01:42:13.860 align:start position:0%
portfolio just briefly hitting on the
 
01:42:16.030 --> 01:42:16.040 align:start position:0%
next slide
 
01:42:19.310 --> 01:42:19.320 align:start position:0%
our Administration uh is responsible for
 
01:42:21.709 --> 01:42:21.719 align:start position:0%
our executive office keeping the
 
01:42:23.990 --> 01:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
Commissioners and directors moving in in
 
01:42:25.970 --> 01:42:25.980 align:start position:0%
the same direction
 
01:42:28.550 --> 01:42:28.560 align:start position:0%
um coordinating uh the funding that we
 
01:42:31.370 --> 01:42:31.380 align:start position:0%
do for uh that we have to give to
 
01:42:33.410 --> 01:42:33.420 align:start position:0%
outside agencies to continue doing what
 
01:42:35.750 --> 01:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
we do we have a small But Mighty public
 
01:42:38.270 --> 01:42:38.280 align:start position:0%
information section uh headed by Richard
 
01:42:40.970 --> 01:42:40.980 align:start position:0%
Arkin who who a lot of you will see on
 
01:42:45.109 --> 01:42:45.119 align:start position:0%
Mur from time to time and we also under
 
01:42:47.689 --> 01:42:47.699 align:start position:0%
the direction of the commissioner uh
 
01:42:50.209 --> 01:42:50.219 align:start position:0%
focus on management strategy
 
01:42:52.370 --> 01:42:52.380 align:start position:0%
top to bottom review making sure we're
 
01:42:54.950 --> 01:42:54.960 align:start position:0%
using our uh funds and assets and the
 
01:42:57.890 --> 01:42:57.900 align:start position:0%
most effective and efficient way we can
 
01:43:01.010 --> 01:43:01.020 align:start position:0%
on the finance side we have a an
 
01:43:03.229 --> 01:43:03.239 align:start position:0%
excellent Finance section that deals
 
01:43:04.669 --> 01:43:04.679 align:start position:0%
with budget formulation Financial
 
01:43:06.229 --> 01:43:06.239 align:start position:0%
operations all the things you would
 
01:43:06.239 --> 01:43:06.970 align:start position:0%
operations all the things you would
expect

01:43:06.970 --> 01:43:06.980 align:start position:0%
expect
 
01:43:09.890 --> 01:43:09.900 align:start position:0%
I thought coming from the federal side
 
01:43:11.870 --> 01:43:11.880 align:start position:0%
that I thought I knew colors of money
 
01:43:14.270 --> 01:43:14.280 align:start position:0%
and how complex those could be I didn't
 
01:43:15.490 --> 01:43:15.500 align:start position:0%
know anything
 
01:43:19.790 --> 01:43:19.800 align:start position:0%
the the numbers of colors in the rainbow
 
01:43:21.890 --> 01:43:21.900 align:start position:0%
of money that our finance section has to
 
01:43:24.050 --> 01:43:24.060 align:start position:0%
deal with it's staggering and they do a
 
01:43:26.270 --> 01:43:26.280 align:start position:0%
very effective job at it
 
01:43:29.149 --> 01:43:29.159 align:start position:0%
finally our policy and administration
 
01:43:31.310 --> 01:43:31.320 align:start position:0%
also deals with typical human resources
 
01:43:34.129 --> 01:43:34.139 align:start position:0%
we have a very strong relationship with
 
01:43:37.609 --> 01:43:37.619 align:start position:0%
dop we we operate hand in hand with them
 
01:43:40.010 --> 01:43:40.020 align:start position:0%
on everything from
 
01:43:42.649 --> 01:43:42.659 align:start position:0%
from Personnel system modifications
 
01:43:44.750 --> 01:43:44.760 align:start position:0%
redesigned to operating as a test bed
 
01:43:47.510 --> 01:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
for them we are a large agency so we uh
 
01:43:50.209 --> 01:43:50.219 align:start position:0%
we are really proud and value that
 
01:43:53.810 --> 01:43:53.820 align:start position:0%
partnership we have with Das and dop
 
01:43:56.270 --> 01:43:56.280 align:start position:0%
um and we also make sure we keep all of
 
01:43:58.490 --> 01:43:58.500 align:start position:0%
our contracts uh in compliance with
 
01:44:00.229 --> 01:44:00.239 align:start position:0%
federal laws with our with our federal
 
01:44:02.209 --> 01:44:02.219 align:start position:0%
compliance section and our internal
 
01:44:04.129 --> 01:44:04.139 align:start position:0%
audit also helps in that regard as well
 
01:44:06.350 --> 01:44:06.360 align:start position:0%
and Workforce analytics are something
 
01:44:08.689 --> 01:44:08.699 align:start position:0%
the commissioner will touch on more as
 
01:44:11.510 --> 01:44:11.520 align:start position:0%
we go through our presentation but that
 
01:44:13.729 --> 01:44:13.739 align:start position:0%

describing uh project Development
 
01:44:47.149 --> 01:44:47.159 align:start position:0%
Division a project development division
 
01:44:50.750 --> 01:44:50.760 align:start position:0%
is responsible for planning and
 
01:44:52.790 --> 01:44:52.800 align:start position:0%
designing and constructing uh
 
01:44:55.430 --> 01:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
Transportation projects
 
01:44:57.830 --> 01:44:57.840 align:start position:0%
um the division includes the bureaus of
 
01:45:00.709 --> 01:45:00.719 align:start position:0%
Highway design bridge design Bureau of
 
01:45:02.450 --> 01:45:02.460 align:start position:0%
environment planning and Community
 
01:45:04.790 --> 01:45:04.800 align:start position:0%
Assistance it works with a lot of the
 
01:45:06.830 --> 01:45:06.840 align:start position:0%
municipalities and helps them in
 
01:45:08.990 --> 01:45:09.000 align:start position:0%
delivering the municipally managed
 
01:45:11.570 --> 01:45:11.580 align:start position:0%
projects and so forth
 
01:45:14.870 --> 01:45:14.880 align:start position:0%
um and also includes
 
01:45:14.880 --> 01:45:16.250 align:start position:0%
um and also includes
um

01:45:16.250 --> 01:45:16.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:18.910 --> 01:45:18.920 align:start position:0%
what else am I missing
 
01:45:22.669 --> 01:45:22.679 align:start position:0%
Bureau of materials and research that
 
01:45:24.830 --> 01:45:24.840 align:start position:0%
um helps make sure that we're specifying
 
01:45:24.840 --> 01:45:26.330 align:start position:0%
um helps make sure that we're specifying

the
 
01:45:29.390 --> 01:45:29.400 align:start position:0%
um right materials for our projects and
 
01:45:32.450 --> 01:45:32.460 align:start position:0%
then also helps to make sure we test the
 
01:45:34.729 --> 01:45:34.739 align:start position:0%
products that the contractors provide to
 
01:45:36.530 --> 01:45:36.540 align:start position:0%
make sure they they meet us
 
01:45:36.540 --> 01:45:38.689 align:start position:0%
make sure they they meet us
specifications

01:45:38.689 --> 01:45:38.699 align:start position:0%
specifications
 
01:45:40.970 --> 01:45:40.980 align:start position:0%
um we the project Development Division
 
01:45:44.030 --> 01:45:44.040 align:start position:0%
delivers the the 10-year plan
 
01:45:46.550 --> 01:45:46.560 align:start position:0%
um we have a current 10-year plan the 23
 
01:45:46.560 --> 01:45:47.990 align:start position:0%
um we have a current 10-year plan the 23
to

01:45:47.990 --> 01:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:45:51.530 --> 01:45:51.540 align:start position:0%
um 34 10-year plan and as soon as this
 
01:45:54.229 --> 01:45:54.239 align:start position:0%
June we'll start developing the next
 
01:45:56.810 --> 01:45:56.820 align:start position:0%
10-year plan that 10-year plan is
 
01:46:00.290 --> 01:46:00.300 align:start position:0%
developed on a two-year cycle
 
01:46:03.350 --> 01:46:03.360 align:start position:0%
um project development puts out projects
 
01:46:06.950 --> 01:46:06.960 align:start position:0%
to expend about 225 million dollars of
 
01:46:09.290 --> 01:46:09.300 align:start position:0%
federal funds each year mostly in
 
01:46:12.550 --> 01:46:12.560 align:start position:0%
construction projects in fiscal year 22
 
01:46:17.270 --> 01:46:17.280 align:start position:0%
57 new projects contracts were well that
 
01:46:18.790 --> 01:46:18.800 align:start position:0%
in our Bureau of construction
 
01:46:21.830 --> 01:46:21.840 align:start position:0%
administered over 84 active construction
 
01:46:21.840 --> 01:46:23.870 align:start position:0%
administered over 84 active construction
projects

01:46:23.870 --> 01:46:23.880 align:start position:0%
projects
 
01:46:26.770 --> 01:46:26.780 align:start position:0%
um in the advertised contract value is
 
01:46:31.490 --> 01:46:31.500 align:start position:0%
233 million dollars for fiscal year 22.
 
01:46:33.950 --> 01:46:33.960 align:start position:0%
shifting over to maintenance and
 
01:46:36.410 --> 01:46:36.420 align:start position:0%
Operations Division these are the the
 
01:46:38.830 --> 01:46:38.840 align:start position:0%
folks that that maintain
 
01:46:40.910 --> 01:46:40.920 align:start position:0%
preserve and preserve that
 
01:46:43.750 --> 01:46:43.760 align:start position:0%
transportation system on a daily basis
 
01:46:46.490 --> 01:46:46.500 align:start position:0%
across the state we have six Highway
 
01:46:48.950 --> 01:46:48.960 align:start position:0%
Maintenance districts
 
01:46:51.470 --> 01:46:51.480 align:start position:0%
um that consist of about 87 Patrol
 
01:46:55.250 --> 01:46:55.260 align:start position:0%
sections 87 Patrol sections sounds like
 
01:46:57.830 --> 01:46:57.840 align:start position:0%
a lot but when you think of of the size
 
01:46:59.930 --> 01:46:59.940 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire that's about one Patrol
 
01:47:02.930 --> 01:47:02.940 align:start position:0%
section for every two and a half to
 
01:47:05.810 --> 01:47:05.820 align:start position:0%
three towns so they do cover a
 
01:47:08.390 --> 01:47:08.400 align:start position:0%
significant area and those are the folks
 
01:47:11.270 --> 01:47:11.280 align:start position:0%
that that plow the roads with a contract
 
01:47:14.930 --> 01:47:14.940 align:start position:0%
rented equipment help trim the trees Mo
 
01:47:17.990 --> 01:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
mow repair drainage and keep things
 
01:47:21.229 --> 01:47:21.239 align:start position:0%
working and provide storm response and
 
01:47:25.189 --> 01:47:25.199 align:start position:0%
so forth we also have our turnpikes
 
01:47:27.229 --> 01:47:27.239 align:start position:0%
division that I'll get into a little bit
 
01:47:29.930 --> 01:47:29.940 align:start position:0%
more detail on in a few minutes and
 
01:47:32.109 --> 01:47:32.119 align:start position:0%
turnpike's Division
 
01:47:34.490 --> 01:47:34.500 align:start position:0%
provides a lot of those same services
 
01:47:38.209 --> 01:47:38.219 align:start position:0%
but is focused on the turnpike system
 
01:47:40.970 --> 01:47:40.980 align:start position:0%
also included in operations is that
 
01:47:43.609 --> 01:47:43.619 align:start position:0%
Bureau of traffic that does uh our
 
01:47:46.070 --> 01:47:46.080 align:start position:0%
roadway line stripings takes care of our
 
01:47:48.709 --> 01:47:48.719 align:start position:0%
signs and traffic signals Bureau of
 
01:47:51.470 --> 01:47:51.480 align:start position:0%
traffic is responsible for speed limits
 
01:47:53.750 --> 01:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
they also have a traffic research
 
01:47:57.189 --> 01:47:57.199 align:start position:0%
section in a traffic engineering section
 
01:47:59.510 --> 01:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
those are the things all the the
 
01:48:02.030 --> 01:48:02.040 align:start position:0%
motorists notice the signs the the
 
01:48:04.370 --> 01:48:04.380 align:start position:0%
pavement markings and so forth and we
 
01:48:07.129 --> 01:48:07.139 align:start position:0%
can have a huge impact on safety by
 
01:48:09.290 --> 01:48:09.300 align:start position:0%
making sure that those pavement markings
 
01:48:12.890 --> 01:48:12.900 align:start position:0%
are refreshed on an annual cycle
 
01:48:15.770 --> 01:48:15.780 align:start position:0%
um and signs are kept up today I Bridge
 
01:48:15.780 --> 01:48:17.510 align:start position:0%
um and signs are kept up today I Bridge
maintenance

01:48:17.510 --> 01:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
maintenance
 
01:48:20.330 --> 01:48:20.340 align:start position:0%
um Bureau takes care of all of our
 
01:48:23.090 --> 01:48:23.100 align:start position:0%
state-owned bridges including the lift
 
01:48:26.270 --> 01:48:26.280 align:start position:0%
Bridges and in Portsmouth and does
 
01:48:28.430 --> 01:48:28.440 align:start position:0%
preservation work and maintenance work
 
01:48:31.669 --> 01:48:31.679 align:start position:0%
we work to strive to wash our bridges
 
01:48:34.689 --> 01:48:34.699 align:start position:0%
every year to seal them every five years
 
01:48:37.490 --> 01:48:37.500 align:start position:0%
and by making that investment in
 
01:48:40.310 --> 01:48:40.320 align:start position:0%
maintenance reservation we really extend
 
01:48:42.709 --> 01:48:42.719 align:start position:0%
the life of bridges which is very
 
01:48:45.050 --> 01:48:45.060 align:start position:0%
important running a cost-effective
 
01:48:48.050 --> 01:48:48.060 align:start position:0%
transportation system we have a bureau
 
01:48:49.930 --> 01:48:49.940 align:start position:0%
of Mechanical Services
 
01:48:53.330 --> 01:48:53.340 align:start position:0%
we have a fleet that's um worth just
 
01:48:56.450 --> 01:48:56.460 align:start position:0%
over has a replacement value of just
 
01:49:00.709 --> 01:49:00.719 align:start position:0%
over 110 million dollars that consists
 
01:49:05.090 --> 01:49:05.100 align:start position:0%
of 1250 vehicles and and accessories the
 
01:49:09.890 --> 01:49:09.900 align:start position:0%
bulk of that is a 340 heavy trucks most
 
01:49:11.990 --> 01:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
of which but not all
 
01:49:14.930 --> 01:49:14.940 align:start position:0%
um provide winter maintenance and also
 
01:49:18.890 --> 01:49:18.900 align:start position:0%
includes those numbers also include 315
 
01:49:21.410 --> 01:49:21.420 align:start position:0%
of the assault spreaders that that go in
 
01:49:23.830 --> 01:49:23.840 align:start position:0%
those truck sets as well
 
01:49:28.129 --> 01:49:28.139 align:start position:0%
we have a fuel distribution section that
 
01:49:33.950 --> 01:49:33.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:37.790 --> 01:49:37.800 align:start position:0%
freed if you will or or fueling sites
 
01:49:41.990 --> 01:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
um that fuel provides us our Diesel and
 
01:49:44.270 --> 01:49:44.280 align:start position:0%
gasoline as well as all other state
 
01:49:47.990 --> 01:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
agencies and municipals and non-profits
 
01:49:51.050 --> 01:49:51.060 align:start position:0%
can also purchase their fuel from that
 
01:49:51.060 --> 01:49:52.370 align:start position:0%
can also purchase their fuel from that
system

01:49:52.370 --> 01:49:52.380 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:49:54.830 --> 01:49:54.840 align:start position:0%
um it's very convenient for us most of
 
01:49:56.930 --> 01:49:56.940 align:start position:0%
these fuel sites are located at our
 
01:49:59.629 --> 01:49:59.639 align:start position:0%
facilities so obviously they're they're
 
01:50:02.810 --> 01:50:02.820 align:start position:0%
available for US 24 7.
 
01:50:05.209 --> 01:50:05.219 align:start position:0%
um and it also provides us a a little
 
01:50:06.950 --> 01:50:06.960 align:start position:0%
bit of cushion
 
01:50:09.350 --> 01:50:09.360 align:start position:0%
um should something happen in the in the
 
01:50:11.750 --> 01:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
market whether due to
 
01:50:13.729 --> 01:50:13.739 align:start position:0%
um some sort of emergency or other
 
01:50:16.870 --> 01:50:16.880 align:start position:0%
purpose so we have fuel available for us
 
01:50:19.250 --> 01:50:19.260 align:start position:0%
operations also includes a
 
01:50:21.709 --> 01:50:21.719 align:start position:0%
transportation management center that's
 
01:50:24.050 --> 01:50:24.060 align:start position:0%
located at the
 
01:50:26.149 --> 01:50:26.159 align:start position:0%
um iPod the incident planning and
 
01:50:28.490 --> 01:50:28.500 align:start position:0%
operations center in our transportation
 
01:50:31.669 --> 01:50:31.679 align:start position:0%
management center helps to keep traffic
 
01:50:34.250 --> 01:50:34.260 align:start position:0%
flowing every day by monitoring what's
 
01:50:37.370 --> 01:50:37.380 align:start position:0%
going on and providing drivers real-time
 
01:50:39.890 --> 01:50:39.900 align:start position:0%
information so that they can make
 
01:50:43.729 --> 01:50:43.739 align:start position:0%
decisions I'm going to get into just a
 
01:50:46.250 --> 01:50:46.260 align:start position:0%
little bit more detail about the highway
 
01:50:46.260 --> 01:50:47.689 align:start position:0%
little bit more detail about the highway
fund

01:50:47.689 --> 01:50:47.699 align:start position:0%
fund
 
01:50:49.609 --> 01:50:49.619 align:start position:0%
um when a lot of people hear the highway
 
01:50:52.490 --> 01:50:52.500 align:start position:0%
fund they think of Dot and it's
 
01:50:56.030 --> 01:50:56.040 align:start position:0%
important for us to to explain that the
 
01:50:59.030 --> 01:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
highway fund does not exclusively go to
 
01:51:01.550 --> 01:51:01.560 align:start position:0%
Dot and
 
01:51:05.090 --> 01:51:05.100 align:start position:0%
um the the highway fund is not also not
 
01:51:08.450 --> 01:51:08.460 align:start position:0%
Dot's only funding source although it is
 
01:51:12.310 --> 01:51:12.320 align:start position:0%
a a the most significant funding source
 
01:51:14.629 --> 01:51:14.639 align:start position:0%
unrestricted Revenue
 
01:51:17.450 --> 01:51:17.460 align:start position:0%
um in the highway fund is comprised the
 
01:51:21.050 --> 01:51:21.060 align:start position:0%
the gas tax a road toll and registration
 
01:51:24.649 --> 01:51:24.659 align:start position:0%
fees collected by Department of Safety
 
01:51:26.950 --> 01:51:26.960 align:start position:0%
um also Federal construction
 
01:51:29.930 --> 01:51:29.940 align:start position:0%
reimbursements gavi bonds and tiffia
 
01:51:32.810 --> 01:51:32.820 align:start position:0%
proceeds flow through the highway fund
 
01:51:35.149 --> 01:51:35.159 align:start position:0%
as as well
 
01:51:38.149 --> 01:51:38.159 align:start position:0%
um the highway fund is a primary source
 
01:51:40.790 --> 01:51:40.800 align:start position:0%
of funding for Opera for our operating
 
01:51:40.800 --> 01:51:42.770 align:start position:0%
of funding for Opera for our operating
budget

01:51:42.770 --> 01:51:42.780 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:51:45.709 --> 01:51:45.719 align:start position:0%
um in revenue from the highway fund
 
01:51:48.410 --> 01:51:48.420 align:start position:0%
um is also appropriated to other
 
01:51:51.410 --> 01:51:51.420 align:start position:0%
agencies including safety the judicial
 
01:51:54.890 --> 01:51:54.900 align:start position:0%
branch and the Department of Justice in
 
01:51:54.900 --> 01:51:56.410 align:start position:0%
branch and the Department of Justice in
2022

01:51:56.410 --> 01:51:56.420 align:start position:0%
2022
 
01:51:59.030 --> 01:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
59.7 percent of the highway fund was
 
01:52:01.330 --> 01:52:01.340 align:start position:0%
appropriated to dot
 
01:52:05.810 --> 01:52:05.820 align:start position:0%
26.7 percent toddler agencies in 13.6
 
01:52:08.570 --> 01:52:08.580 align:start position:0%
percent to municipalities
 
01:52:10.970 --> 01:52:10.980 align:start position:0%
a little bit about the the turnpike
 
01:52:14.149 --> 01:52:14.159 align:start position:0%
system it includes three three Turnpike
 
01:52:19.070 --> 01:52:19.080 align:start position:0%
segments it's 89 miles long includes 172
 
01:52:22.669 --> 01:52:22.679 align:start position:0%
Bridges seven toll facilities and the
 
01:52:24.470 --> 01:52:24.480 align:start position:0%
most important thing about the the
 
01:52:26.810 --> 01:52:26.820 align:start position:0%
turnpike system is it's an Enterprise
 
01:52:30.290 --> 01:52:30.300 align:start position:0%
fund meaning the tolls that come in from
 
01:52:33.709 --> 01:52:33.719 align:start position:0%
the turnpike must be spent to operate
 
01:52:37.129 --> 01:52:37.139 align:start position:0%
maintain or expand the turnpike system
 
01:52:40.609 --> 01:52:40.619 align:start position:0%
and they can't be spent on anything else
 
01:52:43.490 --> 01:52:43.500 align:start position:0%
that that the department or others would
 
01:52:47.510 --> 01:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
would like us to to spend those funds on
 
01:52:51.290 --> 01:52:51.300 align:start position:0%
um so the turnpike is is self-funding
 
01:52:54.169 --> 01:52:54.179 align:start position:0%
um the revenue pays for operating and
 
01:52:57.229 --> 01:52:57.239 align:start position:0%
maintenance costs Debt Service renewal
 
01:52:59.450 --> 01:52:59.460 align:start position:0%
and replacement work very important
 
01:53:01.609 --> 01:53:01.619 align:start position:0%
that's that maintenance and preservation
 
01:53:04.790 --> 01:53:04.800 align:start position:0%
work that helps to preserve the the
 
01:53:07.250 --> 01:53:07.260 align:start position:0%
length and let us run a cost-effective
 
01:53:10.609 --> 01:53:10.619 align:start position:0%
Turnpike system and Capital Improvements
 
01:53:15.290 --> 01:53:15.300 align:start position:0%
in a fiscal year 22 we had 112 million
 
01:53:18.890 --> 01:53:18.900 align:start position:0%
total transactions they yielded 123
 
01:53:25.550 --> 01:53:25.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:28.609 --> 01:53:28.619 align:start position:0%
so um I'll push this over I'll pause
 
01:53:30.229 --> 01:53:30.239 align:start position:0%
there for a minute just to see if there
 
01:53:32.270 --> 01:53:32.280 align:start position:0%
are any any questions I have a few
 
01:53:34.850 --> 01:53:34.860 align:start position:0%
um issues and challenges that I was
 
01:53:36.290 --> 01:53:36.300 align:start position:0%
going to kind of go through but we've
 
01:53:37.970 --> 01:53:37.980 align:start position:0%
kind of covered a lot of details so I
 
01:53:39.530 --> 01:53:39.540 align:start position:0%
just you know if there's any questions
 
01:53:41.450 --> 01:53:41.460 align:start position:0%
about the operations of the department
 
01:53:43.430 --> 01:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
maybe we can pause for a minute there
 
01:53:46.910 --> 01:53:46.920 align:start position:0%
any well I see representative sakes
 
01:53:46.920 --> 01:53:48.169 align:start position:0%
any well I see representative sakes
foreign

01:53:48.169 --> 01:53:48.179 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:53:50.149 --> 01:53:50.159 align:start position:0%
thank you commissioner
 
01:53:52.609 --> 01:53:52.619 align:start position:0%
um there's a management strategy with
 
01:53:55.550 --> 01:53:55.560 align:start position:0%
respect to Road repairs and so on where
 
01:53:55.560 --> 01:53:56.450 align:start position:0%
respect to Road repairs and so on where
you

01:53:56.450 --> 01:53:56.460 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:54:00.169 --> 01:54:00.179 align:start position:0%
spend the biggest bucket of money on
 
01:54:02.510 --> 01:54:02.520 align:start position:0%
less damaged roads that will extend
 
01:54:04.970 --> 01:54:04.980 align:start position:0%
their life much further and you're sort
 
01:54:08.090 --> 01:54:08.100 align:start position:0%
of not ignore but you know put off the
 
01:54:10.729 --> 01:54:10.739 align:start position:0%
really heavily damaged ones because it
 
01:54:12.410 --> 01:54:12.420 align:start position:0%
costs so much more to do such a small
 
01:54:14.930 --> 01:54:14.940 align:start position:0%
space do you take a look at that kind of
 
01:54:17.570 --> 01:54:17.580 align:start position:0%
concept in the 10-year plan yes yes
 
01:54:20.450 --> 01:54:20.460 align:start position:0%
absolutely and a lot of our
 
01:54:20.460 --> 01:54:21.229 align:start position:0%
absolutely and a lot of our
um

01:54:21.229 --> 01:54:21.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:24.830 --> 01:54:24.840 align:start position:0%
you know program Investments are uh you
 
01:54:27.169 --> 01:54:27.179 align:start position:0%
know driven by our asset management
 
01:54:28.609 --> 01:54:28.619 align:start position:0%
approach and our asset management
 
01:54:31.850 --> 01:54:31.860 align:start position:0%
program Andre talked about some of that
 
01:54:33.950 --> 01:54:33.960 align:start position:0%
um that that group with this with the
 
01:54:36.050 --> 01:54:36.060 align:start position:0%
some of the asset management strategy
 
01:54:40.129 --> 01:54:40.139 align:start position:0%
but um we have for a number of years
 
01:54:44.270 --> 01:54:44.280 align:start position:0%
since around 2014 really been focused on
 
01:54:45.709 --> 01:54:45.719 align:start position:0%
um particularly on the capital program
 
01:54:48.410 --> 01:54:48.420 align:start position:0%
particularly through the 10-year plan
 
01:54:50.810 --> 01:54:50.820 align:start position:0%
um uh you know preservation and
 
01:54:52.850 --> 01:54:52.860 align:start position:0%
maintenance first and foremost taking
 
01:54:56.390 --> 01:54:56.400 align:start position:0%
care of of what we have and
 
01:54:58.490 --> 01:54:58.500 align:start position:0%
um you know part of that is through a
 
01:55:00.470 --> 01:55:00.480 align:start position:0%
balanced approach keeping good roads in
 
01:55:03.950 --> 01:55:03.960 align:start position:0%
good condition while still trying to uh
 
01:55:07.010 --> 01:55:07.020 align:start position:0%
address the backlog of of uh roads and
 
01:55:10.250 --> 01:55:10.260 align:start position:0%
pavement condition that are in poor
 
01:55:10.260 --> 01:55:11.629 align:start position:0%
pavement condition that are in poor
condition

01:55:11.629 --> 01:55:11.639 align:start position:0%
condition
 
01:55:14.330 --> 01:55:14.340 align:start position:0%
um we have found in in and nationally
 
01:55:16.550 --> 01:55:16.560 align:start position:0%
some of those Asset Management type
 
01:55:18.890 --> 01:55:18.900 align:start position:0%
approaches have also you know kind of
 
01:55:23.330 --> 01:55:23.340 align:start position:0%
proven true that you know a focus on uh
 
01:55:26.330 --> 01:55:26.340 align:start position:0%
strictly worst first taking care of just
 
01:55:28.430 --> 01:55:28.440 align:start position:0%
the worst first
 
01:55:32.510 --> 01:55:32.520 align:start position:0%
um you never you never catch up and
 
01:55:35.450 --> 01:55:35.460 align:start position:0%
um you know since we've really focused
 
01:55:37.250 --> 01:55:37.260 align:start position:0%
on this Asset Management strategy
 
01:55:39.290 --> 01:55:39.300 align:start position:0%
beginning in 2014
 
01:55:42.109 --> 01:55:42.119 align:start position:0%
I go back to 2014 because we also had
 
01:55:42.119 --> 01:55:43.010 align:start position:0%
I go back to 2014 because we also had
some

01:55:43.010 --> 01:55:43.020 align:start position:0%
some
 
01:55:43.020 --> 01:55:43.850 align:start position:0%
some
um

01:55:43.850 --> 01:55:43.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:47.330 --> 01:55:47.340 align:start position:0%
additional Revenue through SB 367 that
 
01:55:50.209 --> 01:55:50.219 align:start position:0%
that that allowed us to
 
01:55:53.570 --> 01:55:53.580 align:start position:0%
um you know address particularly uh
 
01:55:55.850 --> 01:55:55.860 align:start position:0%
you know some of the unbuilt roads and
 
01:56:00.350 --> 01:56:00.360 align:start position:0%
some of the uh more rural uh roads
 
01:56:02.570 --> 01:56:02.580 align:start position:0%
um we have we have we have we have data
 
01:56:04.310 --> 01:56:04.320 align:start position:0%
that shows that you know our pavement
 
01:56:07.490 --> 01:56:07.500 align:start position:0%
conditions Statewide system-wide is has
 
01:56:11.390 --> 01:56:11.400 align:start position:0%
been consistently improving uh and the
 
01:56:12.950 --> 01:56:12.960 align:start position:0%
number of Red List Bridges has
 
01:56:15.109 --> 01:56:15.119 align:start position:0%
consistently been declining so our
 
01:56:19.250 --> 01:56:19.260 align:start position:0%
pavement condition is is uh is up the
 
01:56:21.290 --> 01:56:21.300 align:start position:0%
structurally deficient Red List bridges
 
01:56:24.410 --> 01:56:24.420 align:start position:0%
are down which I think speaks to the
 
01:56:26.689 --> 01:56:26.699 align:start position:0%
success of of
 
01:56:28.189 --> 01:56:28.199 align:start position:0%
um you know our asset management
 
01:56:30.410 --> 01:56:30.420 align:start position:0%
strategy strategy exactly what you're
 
01:56:32.770 --> 01:56:32.780 align:start position:0%
asking about
 
01:56:36.050 --> 01:56:36.060 align:start position:0%
yep my follow-up I was not a follow-up a
 
01:56:37.609 --> 01:56:37.619 align:start position:0%
different question if you make okay I
 
01:56:39.350 --> 01:56:39.360 align:start position:0%
have another one
 
01:56:40.669 --> 01:56:40.679 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:56:42.590 --> 01:56:42.600 align:start position:0%
um Mr chairman
 
01:56:42.600 --> 01:56:43.370 align:start position:0%
um Mr chairman
um

01:56:43.370 --> 01:56:43.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:45.709 --> 01:56:45.719 align:start position:0%
several years ago this committee I think
 
01:56:47.330 --> 01:56:47.340 align:start position:0%
it was several years ago this committee
 
01:56:48.950 --> 01:56:48.960 align:start position:0%
and this house
 
01:56:51.350 --> 01:56:51.360 align:start position:0%
passed a bill that changed the fee
 
01:56:55.310 --> 01:56:55.320 align:start position:0%
structure for aircraft registrations and
 
01:56:57.709 --> 01:56:57.719 align:start position:0%
one of the concerns that some of us had
 
01:56:59.750 --> 01:56:59.760 align:start position:0%
at that time was that it would adversely
 
01:57:01.490 --> 01:57:01.500 align:start position:0%
they were trying to lower the prices to
 
01:57:01.500 --> 01:57:02.450 align:start position:0%
they were trying to lower the prices to
make

01:57:02.450 --> 01:57:02.460 align:start position:0%
make
 
01:57:04.550 --> 01:57:04.560 align:start position:0%
some airports more competitive with
 
01:57:06.770 --> 01:57:06.780 align:start position:0%
other airports in other states and I
 
01:57:09.830 --> 01:57:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:12.350 --> 01:57:12.360 align:start position:0%
sugared out over the last little bit in
 
01:57:17.030 --> 01:57:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:20.330 --> 01:57:20.340 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you sir
 
01:57:21.830 --> 01:57:21.840 align:start position:0%
it's one of my big questions too when I
 
01:57:24.589 --> 01:57:24.599 align:start position:0%
came on board and uh you know the bottom
 
01:57:27.830 --> 01:57:27.840 align:start position:0%
line is we've reached an equilibrium and
 
01:57:29.629 --> 01:57:29.639 align:start position:0%
I think we have a good Pace now where
 
01:57:31.850 --> 01:57:31.860 align:start position:0%
we're utilizing those funds in the most
 
01:57:35.030 --> 01:57:35.040 align:start position:0%
effective way we can helping as I as I
 
01:57:38.629 --> 01:57:38.639 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier uh non-uh non-federal
 
01:57:41.870 --> 01:57:41.880 align:start position:0%
funded airports obviously could we do
 
01:57:44.089 --> 01:57:44.099 align:start position:0%
more with more the answer is yes
 
01:57:47.330 --> 01:57:47.340 align:start position:0%
uh but what we seek to do is use those
 
01:57:50.209 --> 01:57:50.219 align:start position:0%
resources that you in this chamber
 
01:57:52.790 --> 01:57:52.800 align:start position:0%
give to us in the most effective way we
 
01:57:55.850 --> 01:57:55.860 align:start position:0%
can but uh I will never turn down some
 
01:57:58.070 --> 01:57:58.080 align:start position:0%
additional funds if they're coming our
 
01:57:58.080 --> 01:58:00.290 align:start position:0%
additional funds if they're coming our
way

01:58:00.290 --> 01:58:00.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:02.390 --> 01:58:02.400 align:start position:0%
let me does anybody else have a question
 
01:58:04.629 --> 01:58:04.639 align:start position:0%
let me in all fairness representative
 
01:58:07.910 --> 01:58:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:09.890 --> 01:58:09.900 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um
 
01:58:12.169 --> 01:58:12.179 align:start position:0%
gentlemen one of your uh
 
01:58:14.629 --> 01:58:14.639 align:start position:0%
unrestricted Revenue funds is the gas
 
01:58:14.639 --> 01:58:15.790 align:start position:0%
unrestricted Revenue funds is the gas
tax

01:58:15.790 --> 01:58:15.800 align:start position:0%
tax
 
01:58:19.490 --> 01:58:19.500 align:start position:0%
and obviously as Society is turning over
 
01:58:22.189 --> 01:58:22.199 align:start position:0%
to EV there's going to be a declination
 
01:58:22.199 --> 01:58:23.510 align:start position:0%
to EV there's going to be a declination
there

01:58:23.510 --> 01:58:23.520 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:58:27.470 --> 01:58:27.480 align:start position:0%
um do you have a plan to adjust for that
 
01:58:30.350 --> 01:58:30.360 align:start position:0%
I I can I can speak to that uh and a
 
01:58:32.030 --> 01:58:32.040 align:start position:0%
little bit I had a couple more slides to
 
01:58:34.490 --> 01:58:34.500 align:start position:0%
cover and if uh one of the issue one of
 
01:58:36.050 --> 01:58:36.060 align:start position:0%
the longer term issues that I was going
 
01:58:38.089 --> 01:58:38.099 align:start position:0%
to address so
 
01:58:39.890 --> 01:58:39.900 align:start position:0%
take it in context there or I can take
 
01:58:42.290 --> 01:58:42.300 align:start position:0%
it now however you want me to okay yeah
 
01:58:43.490 --> 01:58:43.500 align:start position:0%
please because I'm looking at the clock
 
01:58:45.050 --> 01:58:45.060 align:start position:0%
now we are we do have a few more
 
01:58:47.750 --> 01:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
speakers so uh represent was there
 
01:58:48.850 --> 01:58:48.860 align:start position:0%
anybody else from the committee
 
01:58:51.649 --> 01:58:51.659 align:start position:0%
representative Hill
 
01:58:53.629 --> 01:58:53.639 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:58:56.030 --> 01:58:56.040 align:start position:0%
taking my question I'm wondering if uh
 
01:58:58.310 --> 01:58:58.320 align:start position:0%
you could speak briefly about the
 
01:59:02.030 --> 01:59:02.040 align:start position:0%
renumbering uh exit number system and
 
01:59:05.030 --> 01:59:05.040 align:start position:0%
and where we are with that
 
01:59:05.040 --> 01:59:06.290 align:start position:0%
and where we are with that
certainly

01:59:06.290 --> 01:59:06.300 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
01:59:06.300 --> 01:59:07.609 align:start position:0%
certainly
um

01:59:07.609 --> 01:59:07.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:11.089 --> 01:59:11.099 align:start position:0%
there is a a you know nationally
 
01:59:14.030 --> 01:59:14.040 align:start position:0%
um the standard is to have exit numbers
 
01:59:17.089 --> 01:59:17.099 align:start position:0%
on on the interstates and freeways
 
01:59:20.510 --> 01:59:20.520 align:start position:0%
um correlate to mileage reference uh
 
01:59:20.520 --> 01:59:21.530 align:start position:0%
um correlate to mileage reference uh
numbers

01:59:21.530 --> 01:59:21.540 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
01:59:23.689 --> 01:59:23.699 align:start position:0%
um New Hampshire has never embraced that
 
01:59:27.169 --> 01:59:27.179 align:start position:0%
and we have kind of put off
 
01:59:27.179 --> 01:59:28.490 align:start position:0%
and we have kind of put off
um

01:59:28.490 --> 01:59:28.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:30.950 --> 01:59:30.960 align:start position:0%
complying with that for for for some
 
01:59:33.350 --> 01:59:33.360 align:start position:0%
time we're tourist oriented State we
 
01:59:34.669 --> 01:59:34.679 align:start position:0%
don't have
 
01:59:37.310 --> 01:59:37.320 align:start position:0%
um you know real real long sections of
 
01:59:40.129 --> 01:59:40.139 align:start position:0%
Interstate that uh you know where it may
 
01:59:41.689 --> 01:59:41.699 align:start position:0%
be more beneficial and things things
 
01:59:43.010 --> 01:59:43.020 align:start position:0%
like that
 
01:59:43.020 --> 01:59:43.850 align:start position:0%
like that
um

01:59:43.850 --> 01:59:43.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:46.310 --> 01:59:46.320 align:start position:0%
so over the last couple of years because
 
01:59:47.990 --> 01:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
of that Federal mandate we have brought
 
01:59:49.609 --> 01:59:49.619 align:start position:0%
it up through the 10-year plan we have
 
01:59:52.550 --> 01:59:52.560 align:start position:0%
proposed a couple of of projects mainly
 
01:59:52.560 --> 01:59:53.750 align:start position:0%
proposed a couple of of projects mainly
because

01:59:53.750 --> 01:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:59:53.760 --> 01:59:54.410 align:start position:0%
because
um

01:59:54.410 --> 01:59:54.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:56.030 --> 01:59:56.040 align:start position:0%
to show good faith to the federal
 
01:59:58.250 --> 01:59:58.260 align:start position:0%
requirements that that we were bringing
 
02:00:00.229 --> 02:00:00.239 align:start position:0%
it up as an issue
 
02:00:02.990 --> 02:00:03.000 align:start position:0%
um the last two times that it has come
 
02:00:04.550 --> 02:00:04.560 align:start position:0%
up through the 10-year plan with the
 
02:00:05.750 --> 02:00:05.760 align:start position:0%
executive Council and through the
 
02:00:08.050 --> 02:00:08.060 align:start position:0%
governor 's office
 
02:00:09.950 --> 02:00:09.960 align:start position:0%
it has
 
02:00:13.030 --> 02:00:13.040 align:start position:0%
it has not been embraced or not been
 
02:00:18.169 --> 02:00:18.179 align:start position:0%
endorsed so where where we're at a um
 
02:00:20.649 --> 02:00:20.659 align:start position:0%
I think Andre's word was unique
 
02:00:22.970 --> 02:00:22.980 align:start position:0%
equilibrium there
 
02:00:24.830 --> 02:00:24.840 align:start position:0%
um there's a there's a case to be made
 
02:00:28.970 --> 02:00:28.980 align:start position:0%
on on both both sides of the issue
 
02:00:32.750 --> 02:00:32.760 align:start position:0%
um I am not a a
 
02:00:34.250 --> 02:00:34.260 align:start position:0%
it's not an issue that I think we're
 
02:00:36.050 --> 02:00:36.060 align:start position:0%
going to fall on our sword over unless
 
02:00:37.629 --> 02:00:37.639 align:start position:0%
Federal Highway
 
02:00:41.629 --> 02:00:41.639 align:start position:0%
has some more stringent requirements
 
02:00:44.149 --> 02:00:44.159 align:start position:0%
um right now we we keep monitoring it
 
02:00:46.570 --> 02:00:46.580 align:start position:0%
and say we'll work on it and bring it up
 
02:00:49.310 --> 02:00:49.320 align:start position:0%
but there hasn't been the support for it
 
02:00:51.109 --> 02:00:51.119 align:start position:0%
publicly and um
 
02:00:53.089 --> 02:00:53.099 align:start position:0%
so that that's kind of where it stands I
 
02:00:54.770 --> 02:00:54.780 align:start position:0%
will say that you know recently
 
02:00:56.990 --> 02:00:57.000 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts within the last couple of
 
02:01:00.890 --> 02:01:00.900 align:start position:0%
years has has changed Vermont has dual
 
02:01:02.750 --> 02:01:02.760 align:start position:0%
postings on their signs Massachusetts
 
02:01:06.169 --> 02:01:06.179 align:start position:0%
changed a while ago I think
 
02:01:08.209 --> 02:01:08.219 align:start position:0%
um you know New Hampshire and maybe
 
02:01:10.850 --> 02:01:10.860 align:start position:0%
Delaware are one of the only two states
 
02:01:12.770 --> 02:01:12.780 align:start position:0%
in the country that do not
 
02:01:12.780 --> 02:01:13.370 align:start position:0%
in the country that do not
um

02:01:13.370 --> 02:01:13.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:01:17.030 --> 02:01:17.040 align:start position:0%
uh by standard do exit number exit
 
02:01:19.370 --> 02:01:19.380 align:start position:0%
numbering on the interstate it's it's
 
02:01:21.169 --> 02:01:21.179 align:start position:0%
sequential and not mile referenced
 
02:01:22.970 --> 02:01:22.980 align:start position:0%
marking but
 
02:01:26.930 --> 02:01:26.940 align:start position:0%
um over time as as that goes on if there
 
02:01:30.169 --> 02:01:30.179 align:start position:0%
is support for that uh we we if there is
 
02:01:32.089 --> 02:01:32.099 align:start position:0%
support for it we we can see and address
 
02:01:34.490 --> 02:01:34.500 align:start position:0%
it to come in to
 
02:01:34.500 --> 02:01:35.089 align:start position:0%
it to come in to
um

02:01:35.089 --> 02:01:35.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:01:37.669 --> 02:01:37.679 align:start position:0%
you know consistent consistency with the
 
02:01:39.470 --> 02:01:39.480 align:start position:0%
rest of the country but
 
02:01:39.480 --> 02:01:40.729 align:start position:0%
rest of the country but
um

02:01:40.729 --> 02:01:40.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:01:42.649 --> 02:01:42.659 align:start position:0%
there are times when New Hampshire likes
 
02:01:45.169 --> 02:01:45.179 align:start position:0%
to stand out and and be independent so
 
02:01:47.930 --> 02:01:47.940 align:start position:0%
we we respect that
 
02:01:50.149 --> 02:01:50.159 align:start position:0%
appreciate that thank you it'll always
 
02:01:54.709 --> 02:01:54.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:56.030 --> 02:01:56.040 align:start position:0%
is that something that can hold off when
 
02:01:59.089 --> 02:01:59.099 align:start position:0%
we are running a light on time
 
02:02:01.189 --> 02:02:01.199 align:start position:0%
representative sellers had one
 
02:02:03.350 --> 02:02:03.360 align:start position:0%
okay I appreciate it we can get all the
 
02:02:05.149 --> 02:02:05.159 align:start position:0%
information we need these gentlemen are
 
02:02:06.950 --> 02:02:06.960 align:start position:0%
always available and and hear quite a
 
02:02:08.629 --> 02:02:08.639 align:start position:0%
bit so
 
02:02:10.250 --> 02:02:10.260 align:start position:0%
um if you wanted to finish up your
 
02:02:12.290 --> 02:02:12.300 align:start position:0%
project very quickly and I'll go through
 
02:02:16.189 --> 02:02:16.199 align:start position:0%
some of the issues so I'm on slide uh
 
02:02:18.950 --> 02:02:18.960 align:start position:0%
uh 14
 
02:02:20.270 --> 02:02:20.280 align:start position:0%
um just some of the issues and
 
02:02:22.010 --> 02:02:22.020 align:start position:0%
challenges just I wanted everybody to be
 
02:02:23.510 --> 02:02:23.520 align:start position:0%
aware of and hopefully I don't I don't
 
02:02:25.250 --> 02:02:25.260 align:start position:0%
think they know that they shouldn't be
 
02:02:27.050 --> 02:02:27.060 align:start position:0%
any surprise but some of the issues
 
02:02:29.089 --> 02:02:29.099 align:start position:0%
particularly this budget season and
 
02:02:30.649 --> 02:02:30.659 align:start position:0%
forward that we're dealing with tend to
 
02:02:30.659 --> 02:02:31.310 align:start position:0%
forward that we're dealing with tend to
be

02:02:31.310 --> 02:02:31.320 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:02:33.109 --> 02:02:33.119 align:start position:0%
um you know issues associated with
 
02:02:34.970 --> 02:02:34.980 align:start position:0%
inflation we're seeing increased labor
 
02:02:37.189 --> 02:02:37.199 align:start position:0%
and material costs and it has a
 
02:02:41.149 --> 02:02:41.159 align:start position:0%
significant impact on our budget most of
 
02:02:42.470 --> 02:02:42.480 align:start position:0%
the additional needs that we have
 
02:02:44.330 --> 02:02:44.340 align:start position:0%
identified in the budget process for
 
02:02:47.050 --> 02:02:47.060 align:start position:0%
example tend to resolve around
 
02:02:49.729 --> 02:02:49.739 align:start position:0%
inflationary impacts particularly for
 
02:02:52.490 --> 02:02:52.500 align:start position:0%
materials type of purchases we use a lot
 
02:02:55.250 --> 02:02:55.260 align:start position:0%
of um we use a lot of fuel we use a lot
 
02:02:56.229 --> 02:02:56.239 align:start position:0%
of salt
 
02:02:58.669 --> 02:02:58.679 align:start position:0%
those are some of the larger Commodities
 
02:03:01.209 --> 02:03:01.219 align:start position:0%
and those have all
 
02:03:05.689 --> 02:03:05.699 align:start position:0%
gone up by you know 50 to 100 percent so
 
02:03:08.330 --> 02:03:08.340 align:start position:0%
they have real impacts on the budget we
 
02:03:11.390 --> 02:03:11.400 align:start position:0%
are also con we are also impacted by
 
02:03:13.669 --> 02:03:13.679 align:start position:0%
supply chain issues and path budgets and
 
02:03:16.609 --> 02:03:16.619 align:start position:0%
past things we have had support for
 
02:03:16.619 --> 02:03:18.890 align:start position:0%
past things we have had support for
equipment

02:03:18.890 --> 02:03:18.900 align:start position:0%
equipment
 
02:03:22.490 --> 02:03:22.500 align:start position:0%
um and other commodity purchases uh
 
02:03:24.950 --> 02:03:24.960 align:start position:0%
particularly on the fleet we have had a
 
02:03:28.790 --> 02:03:28.800 align:start position:0%
a law a struggle in the last two years
 
02:03:30.950 --> 02:03:30.960 align:start position:0%
um fulfilling some of those purchase
 
02:03:33.050 --> 02:03:33.060 align:start position:0%
orders so we have a number of
 
02:03:33.060 --> 02:03:33.770 align:start position:0%
orders so we have a number of
um

02:03:33.770 --> 02:03:33.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:03:37.070 --> 02:03:37.080 align:start position:0%
uh a certain amount of funds um
 
02:03:39.169 --> 02:03:39.179 align:start position:0%
obligated that are that are in process
 
02:03:41.990 --> 02:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
but we're finding that the industry they
 
02:03:43.550 --> 02:03:43.560 align:start position:0%
just can't deliver and they just can't
 
02:03:45.890 --> 02:03:45.900 align:start position:0%
fulfill some of those purchase orders in
 
02:03:47.810 --> 02:03:47.820 align:start position:0%
addition we're seeing increased costs of
 
02:03:49.970 --> 02:03:49.980 align:start position:0%
of uh you know trying to buy equipment
 
02:03:52.609 --> 02:03:52.619 align:start position:0%
and stuff like that so those are issues
 
02:03:54.470 --> 02:03:54.480 align:start position:0%
the biggest issue that we have been
 
02:03:56.930 --> 02:03:56.940 align:start position:0%
confronted with in the last year coming
 
02:03:58.669 --> 02:03:58.679 align:start position:0%
out of the pandemic and I don't think
 
02:04:01.010 --> 02:04:01.020 align:start position:0%
we're unique compared to the rest of the
 
02:04:02.990 --> 02:04:03.000 align:start position:0%
state has been you know Workforce
 
02:04:05.570 --> 02:04:05.580 align:start position:0%
shortages in the amount of vacancies
 
02:04:08.089 --> 02:04:08.099 align:start position:0%
that we have so we have been dealing
 
02:04:10.910 --> 02:04:10.920 align:start position:0%
with historically High vacancy rates at
 
02:04:13.310 --> 02:04:13.320 align:start position:0%
the department in the order of
 
02:04:17.330 --> 02:04:17.340 align:start position:0%
um 22 24 so that's one of approximately
 
02:04:19.490 --> 02:04:19.500 align:start position:0%
every four positions in the department
 
02:04:22.490 --> 02:04:22.500 align:start position:0%
is is is vacant
 
02:04:23.810 --> 02:04:23.820 align:start position:0%
um and
 
02:04:25.850 --> 02:04:25.860 align:start position:0%
um with the historically low
 
02:04:28.850 --> 02:04:28.860 align:start position:0%
unemployment rate and with the uh you
 
02:04:30.589 --> 02:04:30.599 align:start position:0%
know some of the compensation rates that
 
02:04:32.390 --> 02:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
the that the state structure offers
 
02:04:34.550 --> 02:04:34.560 align:start position:0%
we're having difficulties attracting and
 
02:04:36.830 --> 02:04:36.840 align:start position:0%
retaining employees and in particular I
 
02:04:38.390 --> 02:04:38.400 align:start position:0%
heard some of the discussion with DMV
 
02:04:38.400 --> 02:04:39.350 align:start position:0%
heard some of the discussion with DMV
was

02:04:39.350 --> 02:04:39.360 align:start position:0%
was
 
02:04:41.930 --> 02:04:41.940 align:start position:0%
um attracting and hiring snow plow
 
02:04:45.970 --> 02:04:45.980 align:start position:0%
operators which requires CDL licenses
 
02:04:49.729 --> 02:04:49.739 align:start position:0%
we did have uh and you may be aware of
 
02:04:52.669 --> 02:04:52.679 align:start position:0%
it at the end of at the beginning of the
 
02:04:55.430 --> 02:04:55.440 align:start position:0%
fall through the fiscal committee and
 
02:04:57.229 --> 02:04:57.239 align:start position:0%
through government Council we did get
 
02:04:59.629 --> 02:04:59.639 align:start position:0%
approved along with uh Department of
 
02:05:02.870 --> 02:05:02.880 align:start position:0%
Safety and others a
 
02:05:02.880 --> 02:05:04.609 align:start position:0%
Safety and others a
a

02:05:04.609 --> 02:05:04.619 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:05:06.830 --> 02:05:06.840 align:start position:0%
Recruitment and Retention bonus of about
 
02:05:08.870 --> 02:05:08.880 align:start position:0%
five thousand dollars per employee so
 
02:05:10.910 --> 02:05:10.920 align:start position:0%
that has helped
 
02:05:13.070 --> 02:05:13.080 align:start position:0%
um at least stem stem the tide I don't
 
02:05:15.530 --> 02:05:15.540 align:start position:0%
think it's brought a lot of new
 
02:05:18.950 --> 02:05:18.960 align:start position:0%
employees in but it has helped
 
02:05:21.229 --> 02:05:21.239 align:start position:0%
um I think stand stem the tide so we
 
02:05:23.689 --> 02:05:23.699 align:start position:0%
have found since since that past that
 
02:05:27.770 --> 02:05:27.780 align:start position:0%
you know our uh vacancy rate has kind of
 
02:05:30.890 --> 02:05:30.900 align:start position:0%
stagnated it around that 22 20 24
 
02:05:34.189 --> 02:05:34.199 align:start position:0%
percent and that some some some Bureau
 
02:05:35.990 --> 02:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
some areas are higher some areas are
 
02:05:37.810 --> 02:05:37.820 align:start position:0%
lower but that's a department-wide
 
02:05:39.950 --> 02:05:39.960 align:start position:0%
average so
 
02:05:41.990 --> 02:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
it is an issue that we are continuing to
 
02:05:43.490 --> 02:05:43.500 align:start position:0%
deal with
 
02:05:44.930 --> 02:05:44.940 align:start position:0%
um hopefully
 
02:05:44.940 --> 02:05:45.589 align:start position:0%
um hopefully
um

02:05:45.589 --> 02:05:45.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:47.209 --> 02:05:47.219 align:start position:0%
tentative collective bargaining
 
02:05:50.570 --> 02:05:50.580 align:start position:0%
agreement uh will will also be a a
 
02:05:54.410 --> 02:05:54.420 align:start position:0%
positive impact on on some of that as as
 
02:05:55.729 --> 02:05:55.739 align:start position:0%
well too
 
02:05:57.649 --> 02:05:57.659 align:start position:0%
and I bring that up because it is
 
02:06:00.290 --> 02:06:00.300 align:start position:0%
affecting productivity as we have had
 
02:06:02.689 --> 02:06:02.699 align:start position:0%
these vacancies we are
 
02:06:04.850 --> 02:06:04.860 align:start position:0%
moving people around moving resources
 
02:06:07.250 --> 02:06:07.260 align:start position:0%
around to focus on
 
02:06:07.260 --> 02:06:08.089 align:start position:0%
around to focus on
um

02:06:08.089 --> 02:06:08.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:10.010 --> 02:06:10.020 align:start position:0%
you know the critical areas that we need
 
02:06:12.229 --> 02:06:12.239 align:start position:0%
to get done but as a result there are
 
02:06:15.350 --> 02:06:15.360 align:start position:0%
other areas not getting done for example
 
02:06:17.810 --> 02:06:17.820 align:start position:0%
um I mentioned our goal of trying to
 
02:06:20.990 --> 02:06:21.000 align:start position:0%
stripe all of the um all of the highways
 
02:06:21.970 --> 02:06:21.980 align:start position:0%
every year
 
02:06:24.770 --> 02:06:24.780 align:start position:0%
we typically bring on somewhere in the
 
02:06:28.669 --> 02:06:28.679 align:start position:0%
order of uh 35 to 40 seasonal employees
 
02:06:30.950 --> 02:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
to help with
 
02:06:33.830 --> 02:06:33.840 align:start position:0%
um with uh with the striping through the
 
02:06:35.390 --> 02:06:35.400 align:start position:0%
through the year and we have not been
 
02:06:38.890 --> 02:06:38.900 align:start position:0%
able to hire those and we are relying on
 
02:06:41.990 --> 02:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
permanent employees particularly in the
 
02:06:44.270 --> 02:06:44.280 align:start position:0%
patrol sections in the in the in the
 
02:06:46.970 --> 02:06:46.980 align:start position:0%
maintenance districts to fill those
 
02:06:49.250 --> 02:06:49.260 align:start position:0%
positions and get the striping done
 
02:06:51.169 --> 02:06:51.179 align:start position:0%
the downfall is that's taking people
 
02:06:54.410 --> 02:06:54.420 align:start position:0%
away from their regular jobs that uh you
 
02:06:56.270 --> 02:06:56.280 align:start position:0%
know leads to you know some deferred
 
02:06:57.649 --> 02:06:57.659 align:start position:0%
maintenance and reduce preventative
 
02:06:59.629 --> 02:06:59.639 align:start position:0%
maintenance which could have longer term
 
02:06:59.639 --> 02:07:01.310 align:start position:0%
maintenance which could have longer term
implications

02:07:01.310 --> 02:07:01.320 align:start position:0%
implications
 
02:07:04.910 --> 02:07:04.920 align:start position:0%
similarly this winter to help uh fill in
 
02:07:07.070 --> 02:07:07.080 align:start position:0%
some of the vacancies and gaps with uh
 
02:07:09.550 --> 02:07:09.560 align:start position:0%
winter maintenance we have about
 
02:07:14.510 --> 02:07:14.520 align:start position:0%
80 to 85 people that have volunteered to
 
02:07:17.870 --> 02:07:17.880 align:start position:0%
do winter maintenance activities
 
02:07:19.729 --> 02:07:19.739 align:start position:0%
um that's great we we need them that's
 
02:07:22.550 --> 02:07:22.560 align:start position:0%
our priority in the winter but those are
 
02:07:24.350 --> 02:07:24.360 align:start position:0%
people being taken away from their
 
02:07:27.410 --> 02:07:27.420 align:start position:0%
regular day jobs so there are bridge
 
02:07:29.209 --> 02:07:29.219 align:start position:0%
maintenance activities and things like
 
02:07:30.890 --> 02:07:30.900 align:start position:0%
that that would take place during the
 
02:07:33.890 --> 02:07:33.900 align:start position:0%
winter that aren't getting done so it is
 
02:07:35.570 --> 02:07:35.580 align:start position:0%
one of the issues and challenges that
 
02:07:38.270 --> 02:07:38.280 align:start position:0%
that we are continuing to deal with and
 
02:07:38.280 --> 02:07:40.250 align:start position:0%
that we are continuing to deal with and
monitor

02:07:40.250 --> 02:07:40.260 align:start position:0%
monitor
 
02:07:43.609 --> 02:07:43.619 align:start position:0%
um on slide 15 uh so those are more of
 
02:07:45.169 --> 02:07:45.179 align:start position:0%
the immediate challenges and stuff that
 
02:07:48.649 --> 02:07:48.659 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to to discuss but
 
02:07:50.510 --> 02:07:50.520 align:start position:0%
um representative Jones you had talked
 
02:07:53.390 --> 02:07:53.400 align:start position:0%
about the the funding issues and and you
 
02:07:55.390 --> 02:07:55.400 align:start position:0%
know longer term challenges does become
 
02:07:57.649 --> 02:07:57.659 align:start position:0%
uh some funding issues there is
 
02:07:59.450 --> 02:07:59.460 align:start position:0%
insufficient Highway fund Revenue to
 
02:08:03.109 --> 02:08:03.119 align:start position:0%
fund current levels of of service we
 
02:08:04.669 --> 02:08:04.679 align:start position:0%
don't match
 
02:08:04.679 --> 02:08:05.750 align:start position:0%
don't match
um

02:08:05.750 --> 02:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:08.330 --> 02:08:08.340 align:start position:0%
we we don't provide State matching funds
 
02:08:10.550 --> 02:08:10.560 align:start position:0%
for the federal program we rely on
 
02:08:12.470 --> 02:08:12.480 align:start position:0%
something called called Turnpike toll
 
02:08:14.209 --> 02:08:14.219 align:start position:0%
credits because of our Turnpike system
 
02:08:16.850 --> 02:08:16.860 align:start position:0%
we are allowed to use federal funds at a
 
02:08:18.470 --> 02:08:18.480 align:start position:0%
hundred percent
 
02:08:18.480 --> 02:08:19.129 align:start position:0%
hundred percent
um

02:08:19.129 --> 02:08:19.139 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:21.470 --> 02:08:21.480 align:start position:0%
but we don't provide we don't bring any
 
02:08:23.390 --> 02:08:23.400 align:start position:0%
state money to match those federal funds
 
02:08:25.609 --> 02:08:25.619 align:start position:0%
unlike a lot of other states we have
 
02:08:27.830 --> 02:08:27.840 align:start position:0%
limited State funds for addressing
 
02:08:31.209 --> 02:08:31.219 align:start position:0%
non-federal eligible state state roads
 
02:08:34.129 --> 02:08:34.139 align:start position:0%
about a third of our state mileage is
 
02:08:37.729 --> 02:08:37.739 align:start position:0%
not eligible for federal funds so we
 
02:08:37.739 --> 02:08:38.390 align:start position:0%
not eligible for federal funds so we
um

02:08:38.390 --> 02:08:38.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:41.229 --> 02:08:41.239 align:start position:0%
scrape and and try to get those
 
02:08:43.970 --> 02:08:43.980 align:start position:0%
addressed with the limited amount of
 
02:08:46.010 --> 02:08:46.020 align:start position:0%
State funds that we have but that is a
 
02:08:48.410 --> 02:08:48.420 align:start position:0%
an issue of concern and you mentioned
 
02:08:50.570 --> 02:08:50.580 align:start position:0%
representative Jones the declining road
 
02:08:53.629 --> 02:08:53.639 align:start position:0%
toll revenues electric vehicles do have
 
02:08:56.570 --> 02:08:56.580 align:start position:0%
a impact on that but we have also looked
 
02:09:00.050 --> 02:09:00.060 align:start position:0%
at the increasing fuel efficiency of the
 
02:09:03.169 --> 02:09:03.179 align:start position:0%
national Fleet and that continues to
 
02:09:05.629 --> 02:09:05.639 align:start position:0%
have an incremental erosion of the of
 
02:09:08.089 --> 02:09:08.099 align:start position:0%
the road toll
 
02:09:08.099 --> 02:09:09.709 align:start position:0%
the road toll
issues

02:09:09.709 --> 02:09:09.719 align:start position:0%
issues
 
02:09:12.770 --> 02:09:12.780 align:start position:0%
um so a short answer to your question uh
 
02:09:15.589 --> 02:09:15.599 align:start position:0%
other than pointing out the issues uh we
 
02:09:18.169 --> 02:09:18.179 align:start position:0%
don't we don't we don't have a a a a
 
02:09:19.609 --> 02:09:19.619 align:start position:0%
good plan
 
02:09:22.609 --> 02:09:22.619 align:start position:0%
um other than to point out that uh what
 
02:09:24.470 --> 02:09:24.480 align:start position:0%
the levels of service would be and and
 
02:09:28.729 --> 02:09:28.739 align:start position:0%
where our shortfalls are but it's not a
 
02:09:29.990 --> 02:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
new issue
 
02:09:32.450 --> 02:09:32.460 align:start position:0%
um going back a number of years the
 
02:09:34.790 --> 02:09:34.800 align:start position:0%
state highway fund has depended on a
 
02:09:39.169 --> 02:09:39.179 align:start position:0%
whole series of of one-time fixes to
 
02:09:39.179 --> 02:09:40.250 align:start position:0%
whole series of of one-time fixes to
help

02:09:40.250 --> 02:09:40.260 align:start position:0%
help
 
02:09:40.260 --> 02:09:40.970 align:start position:0%
help
um

02:09:40.970 --> 02:09:40.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:09:44.209 --> 02:09:44.219 align:start position:0%
to help balance the the highway fund
 
02:09:46.609 --> 02:09:46.619 align:start position:0%
um there's been registration fees
 
02:09:49.490 --> 02:09:49.500 align:start position:0%
surcharges there has been some
 
02:09:52.609 --> 02:09:52.619 align:start position:0%
asset trans transfers between the
 
02:09:55.189 --> 02:09:55.199 align:start position:0%
turnpike system and the highway fund
 
02:09:55.199 --> 02:09:55.970 align:start position:0%
turnpike system and the highway fund
um

02:09:55.970 --> 02:09:55.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:09:58.430 --> 02:09:58.440 align:start position:0%
and uh most recently at the end of the
 
02:10:01.070 --> 02:10:01.080 align:start position:0%
last biennium the legislature put 50
 
02:10:03.050 --> 02:10:03.060 align:start position:0%
million dollars of general fund Surplus
 
02:10:05.209 --> 02:10:05.219 align:start position:0%
into the highway fund that helps balance
 
02:10:06.709 --> 02:10:06.719 align:start position:0%
the budget helps balance the highway
 
02:10:10.070 --> 02:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
fund through this biennium but it is a
 
02:10:12.109 --> 02:10:12.119 align:start position:0%
it is a longer term issue
 
02:10:12.119 --> 02:10:13.790 align:start position:0%
it is a longer term issue
um

02:10:13.790 --> 02:10:13.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:10:16.370 --> 02:10:16.380 align:start position:0%
um that that that we continue to Monitor
 
02:10:18.470 --> 02:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
and and and discuss with the policy
 
02:10:18.480 --> 02:10:20.390 align:start position:0%
and and and discuss with the policy
makers

02:10:20.390 --> 02:10:20.400 align:start position:0%
makers
 
02:10:23.510 --> 02:10:23.520 align:start position:0%
so that's the I hate to close on a
 
02:10:25.910 --> 02:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
bummer of a note but you know that it is
 
02:10:26.930 --> 02:10:26.940 align:start position:0%
a kind of effect
 
02:10:29.149 --> 02:10:29.159 align:start position:0%
the final couple of charts there I would
 
02:10:30.770 --> 02:10:30.780 align:start position:0%
would point out
 
02:10:32.870 --> 02:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
02:10:37.430 --> 02:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
um slide uh 17 does show the number of
 
02:10:40.669 --> 02:10:40.679 align:start position:0%
personnel over over time and uh the
 
02:10:43.250 --> 02:10:43.260 align:start position:0%
issues in uh you know and the vehicle
 
02:10:45.830 --> 02:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
miles traveled that has continued to
 
02:10:47.510 --> 02:10:47.520 align:start position:0%
grow up and the point of this slide is
 
02:10:50.510 --> 02:10:50.520 align:start position:0%
to is to point out I think we are an
 
02:10:53.750 --> 02:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
efficient organization we continue to do
 
02:10:56.689 --> 02:10:56.699 align:start position:0%
more with less uh we continue to build
 
02:10:59.810 --> 02:10:59.820 align:start position:0%
highways vehicle mile travel the use of
 
02:11:02.930 --> 02:11:02.940 align:start position:0%
the highways is up and uh you know are
 
02:11:06.770 --> 02:11:06.780 align:start position:0%
you know going back to 2012 2013 when
 
02:11:09.229 --> 02:11:09.239 align:start position:0%
when we had uh significant Workforce
 
02:11:11.510 --> 02:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
reduction we have continued to keep up
 
02:11:14.870 --> 02:11:14.880 align:start position:0%
and do more with less so I think
 
02:11:17.510 --> 02:11:17.520 align:start position:0%
um it does speak to and shows
 
02:11:20.570 --> 02:11:20.580 align:start position:0%
graphically that uh we are an efficient
 
02:11:23.030 --> 02:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
organization we strive to continue to be
 
02:11:24.950 --> 02:11:24.960 align:start position:0%
an efficient organization
 
02:11:27.890 --> 02:11:27.900 align:start position:0%
uh the last couple of slides on slide 18
 
02:11:30.470 --> 02:11:30.480 align:start position:0%
are the types of issues that we tend to
 
02:11:32.930 --> 02:11:32.940 align:start position:0%
come before the transportation committee
 
02:11:34.910 --> 02:11:34.920 align:start position:0%
things like speed limits I know there's
 
02:11:37.129 --> 02:11:37.139 align:start position:0%
a bill this afternoon talking about
 
02:11:39.709 --> 02:11:39.719 align:start position:0%
um pedestrian traffic signals things
 
02:11:41.930 --> 02:11:41.940 align:start position:0%
things like that so those are the types
 
02:11:44.689 --> 02:11:44.699 align:start position:0%
of issues that dot would be before the
 
02:11:46.430 --> 02:11:46.440 align:start position:0%
transportation committee with
 
02:11:48.709 --> 02:11:48.719 align:start position:0%
and lastly I just wanted and I won't get
 
02:11:50.750 --> 02:11:50.760 align:start position:0%
through all these uh bullets there's a
 
02:11:52.250 --> 02:11:52.260 align:start position:0%
lot of information that I did want to
 
02:11:55.129 --> 02:11:55.139 align:start position:0%
emphasize just make a
 
02:11:58.070 --> 02:11:58.080 align:start position:0%
the committee aware of there is a New
 
02:12:00.470 --> 02:12:00.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Transportation Council that
 
02:12:02.209 --> 02:12:02.219 align:start position:0%
was established by the legislature in
 
02:12:02.219 --> 02:12:03.790 align:start position:0%
was established by the legislature in
2018

02:12:03.790 --> 02:12:03.800 align:start position:0%
2018
 
02:12:06.169 --> 02:12:06.179 align:start position:0%
it has representation from house
 
02:12:08.330 --> 02:12:08.340 align:start position:0%
Transportation Senate Transportation as
 
02:12:09.970 --> 02:12:09.980 align:start position:0%
well as industry
 
02:12:14.510 --> 02:12:14.520 align:start position:0%
experts in the goal of that committee is
 
02:12:16.850 --> 02:12:16.860 align:start position:0%
to help
 
02:12:19.129 --> 02:12:19.139 align:start position:0%
make recommendations in dealing with
 
02:12:22.629 --> 02:12:22.639 align:start position:0%
multimodal Transportation issues
 
02:12:24.830 --> 02:12:24.840 align:start position:0%
transportation services and other
 
02:12:28.189 --> 02:12:28.199 align:start position:0%
alternative transportation needs so new
 
02:12:29.930 --> 02:12:29.940 align:start position:0%
and emerging Technologies the
 
02:12:32.770 --> 02:12:32.780 align:start position:0%
transportation Council can be a
 
02:12:36.530 --> 02:12:36.540 align:start position:0%
a resource to help
 
02:12:38.450 --> 02:12:38.460 align:start position:0%
to help the transportation committee or
 
02:12:40.609 --> 02:12:40.619 align:start position:0%
help other committees you know research
 
02:12:42.010 --> 02:12:42.020 align:start position:0%
and get information
 
02:12:44.830 --> 02:12:44.840 align:start position:0%
it is a standing it is a standing
 
02:12:48.350 --> 02:12:48.360 align:start position:0%
Council but um I I know in the path
 
02:12:50.270 --> 02:12:50.280 align:start position:0%
there have been a number of legislative
 
02:12:52.430 --> 02:12:52.440 align:start position:0%
study commissions around different
 
02:12:55.010 --> 02:12:55.020 align:start position:0%
issues of transportation and the
 
02:12:57.410 --> 02:12:57.420 align:start position:0%
transportation Council can help be a
 
02:13:00.649 --> 02:13:00.659 align:start position:0%
resource to research and help study some
 
02:13:02.990 --> 02:13:03.000 align:start position:0%
of those issues that if you as a
 
02:13:04.669 --> 02:13:04.679 align:start position:0%
committee feel you don't have enough
 
02:13:08.209 --> 02:13:08.219 align:start position:0%
context or information on to make a
 
02:13:10.850 --> 02:13:10.860 align:start position:0%
um to make a decision on that can be a
 
02:13:14.390 --> 02:13:14.400 align:start position:0%
resource so with that uh uh Mr chair
 
02:13:16.189 --> 02:13:16.199 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time and attention I
 
02:13:18.470 --> 02:13:18.480 align:start position:0%

enforcement Division I am the ohrv or
 
02:14:50.050 --> 02:14:50.060 align:start position:0%
the off Highway Recreation vehicle

coordinator I oversee uh the ohrv
 
02:14:56.810 --> 02:14:56.820 align:start position:0%
enforcement which would include
 
02:15:00.890 --> 02:15:00.900 align:start position:0%
snowmobiles and we also go into safety
 
02:15:03.470 --> 02:15:03.480 align:start position:0%
and the registration program
 
02:15:06.350 --> 02:15:06.360 align:start position:0%
so the department broken up into many
 
02:15:09.410 --> 02:15:09.420 align:start position:0%
divisions uh from the executive
 
02:15:10.810 --> 02:15:10.820 align:start position:0%

um and then like I said marine fisheries
 
02:15:24.410 --> 02:15:24.420 align:start position:0%
law enforcement being a part of the
 
02:15:27.109 --> 02:15:27.119 align:start position:0%
um of the law enforcement being one of
 
02:15:29.569 --> 02:15:29.579 align:start position:0%
the divisions within fish and game
 
02:15:29.579 --> 02:15:30.470 align:start position:0%
the divisions within fish and game
um

02:15:30.470 --> 02:15:30.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:15:34.189 --> 02:15:34.199 align:start position:0%
I think how best to kind of relate uh
 
02:15:36.530 --> 02:15:36.540 align:start position:0%
how you will see Fish and Game in front
 
02:15:39.890 --> 02:15:39.900 align:start position:0%
of your committee would be more than
 
02:15:42.410 --> 02:15:42.420 align:start position:0%
likely in the uh off Highway Recreation
 
02:15:44.990 --> 02:15:45.000 align:start position:0%
vehicle Realm
 
02:15:47.330 --> 02:15:47.340 align:start position:0%
um obviously off Highway recreation
 
02:15:49.310 --> 02:15:49.320 align:start position:0%
vehicles including snowmobiles are very
 
02:15:52.310 --> 02:15:52.320 align:start position:0%
important to our state and how we
 
02:15:54.430 --> 02:15:54.440 align:start position:0%
operate them
 
02:15:58.370 --> 02:15:58.380 align:start position:0%
in relation to tourism for the state is
 
02:16:01.990 --> 02:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
very important I work very closely with
 
02:16:05.689 --> 02:16:05.699 align:start position:0%
these different user groups
 
02:16:08.390 --> 02:16:08.400 align:start position:0%
um and uh
 
02:16:12.410 --> 02:16:12.420 align:start position:0%
you know it once again at
 
02:16:15.830 --> 02:16:15.840 align:start position:0%
some of these ohrvs are operated on uh
 
02:16:19.370 --> 02:16:19.380 align:start position:0%
State roadways and then that also
 
02:16:22.550 --> 02:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
creates some issues obviously within
 
02:16:25.729 --> 02:16:25.739 align:start position:0%
um on these state roads towns within
 
02:16:28.609 --> 02:16:28.619 align:start position:0%
themselves can operate or choose to
 
02:16:32.410 --> 02:16:32.420 align:start position:0%
allow them to be operated on roadways
 
02:16:36.290 --> 02:16:36.300 align:start position:0%
so I I think you know more than not how
 
02:16:38.810 --> 02:16:38.820 align:start position:0%
you will see me as I said is is with
 
02:16:41.270 --> 02:16:41.280 align:start position:0%
these issues as they come up
 
02:16:42.950 --> 02:16:42.960 align:start position:0%
um you know once again these are off
 
02:16:46.429 --> 02:16:46.439 align:start position:0%
Highway recreation vehicles some people
 
02:16:48.530 --> 02:16:48.540 align:start position:0%
feel that they should be operated as
 
02:16:50.330 --> 02:16:50.340 align:start position:0%
conventional Motor Vehicles even though
 
02:16:52.629 --> 02:16:52.639 align:start position:0%
they that's not how they are designed
 
02:16:54.889 --> 02:16:54.899 align:start position:0%
and really I think at the end of the day
 
02:16:57.230 --> 02:16:57.240 align:start position:0%
what I've looked to do and I'm sure you
 
02:16:59.030 --> 02:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
do as well is that when we have folks
 
02:17:01.009 --> 02:17:01.019 align:start position:0%
that come to our state to to recreate
 
02:17:03.349 --> 02:17:03.359 align:start position:0%
that they have a good time doing that
 
02:17:05.330 --> 02:17:05.340 align:start position:0%
and that they don't
 
02:17:08.509 --> 02:17:08.519 align:start position:0%
um end up at the hospital or even worse
 
02:17:11.270 --> 02:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
at the uh at the funeral home so I think
 
02:17:12.589 --> 02:17:12.599 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day that's that's what
 
02:17:14.389 --> 02:17:14.399 align:start position:0%
we're all looking to do I can certainly
 
02:17:15.950 --> 02:17:15.960 align:start position:0%
take questions
 
02:17:18.290 --> 02:17:18.300 align:start position:0%
um I I can certainly pontificate on on
 
02:17:21.110 --> 02:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
what law enforcement division does
 
02:17:22.910 --> 02:17:22.920 align:start position:0%
um and I'm sure you've seen what we do
 
02:17:26.929 --> 02:17:26.939 align:start position:0%
on the news so
 
02:17:29.690 --> 02:17:29.700 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you uh does
 
02:17:31.730 --> 02:17:31.740 align:start position:0%
anybody have any questions
 
02:17:33.530 --> 02:17:33.540 align:start position:0%
I've seen that I don't I don't think I
 
02:17:34.669 --> 02:17:34.679 align:start position:0%
don't think we have any bills this year
 
02:17:36.770 --> 02:17:36.780 align:start position:0%
that we might see you with
 
02:17:39.349 --> 02:17:39.359 align:start position:0%
I'm not that I've seen so far yeah there
 
02:17:41.389 --> 02:17:41.399 align:start position:0%
are a few out there nonetheless I I know
 
02:17:42.950 --> 02:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
you do come here from time to time and I
 
02:17:44.270 --> 02:17:44.280 align:start position:0%
just wanted everybody on the committee
 
02:17:45.830 --> 02:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
to put a face with the department so
 
02:17:47.030 --> 02:17:47.040 align:start position:0%
that when their shoes come up they know
 
02:17:48.650 --> 02:17:48.660 align:start position:0%
who to reach out to so
 
02:17:50.929 --> 02:17:50.939 align:start position:0%

contact information so if you wish to
 
02:18:30.049 --> 02:18:30.059 align:start position:0%

afterwards we will try to do a condensed
 
02:18:34.009 --> 02:18:34.019 align:start position:0%
version of this but absolutely we're
 
02:18:35.990 --> 02:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
open to any questions
 
02:18:38.690 --> 02:18:38.700 align:start position:0%

um

02:18:39.830 --> 02:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:18:41.330 --> 02:18:41.340 align:start position:0%
I'll just give you a quick introduction
 
02:18:43.009 --> 02:18:43.019 align:start position:0%
to myself
 
02:18:45.110 --> 02:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
um Lieutenant Dennis Wade I'm the unit
 
02:18:47.509 --> 02:18:47.519 align:start position:0%
Commander uh at State Police Marine
 
02:18:47.519 --> 02:18:48.290 align:start position:0%
Commander uh at State Police Marine
Patrol

02:18:48.290 --> 02:18:48.300 align:start position:0%
Patrol
 
02:18:51.169 --> 02:18:51.179 align:start position:0%
I've only been over there since May so
 
02:18:53.690 --> 02:18:53.700 align:start position:0%
um I am learning a lot it is it is a a
 
02:18:57.169 --> 02:18:57.179 align:start position:0%
very busy unit we do we certainly do a
 
02:18:59.150 --> 02:18:59.160 align:start position:0%
lot and a lot more than I I ever knew I
 
02:19:01.370 --> 02:19:01.380 align:start position:0%
can tell you that we also have an
 
02:19:01.380 --> 02:19:02.450 align:start position:0%
can tell you that we also have an
extremely

02:19:02.450 --> 02:19:02.460 align:start position:0%
extremely
 
02:19:05.570 --> 02:19:05.580 align:start position:0%
um uh extremely great staff uh very hard
 
02:19:07.910 --> 02:19:07.920 align:start position:0%
working very dedicated not just to their
 
02:19:09.709 --> 02:19:09.719 align:start position:0%
job but I I would say to the mission of
 
02:19:11.389 --> 02:19:11.399 align:start position:0%
Marine Patrol
 
02:19:11.399 --> 02:19:12.290 align:start position:0%
Marine Patrol
um

02:19:12.290 --> 02:19:12.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:19:12.300 --> 02:19:14.089 align:start position:0%
um
the

02:19:14.089 --> 02:19:14.099 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:19:15.830 --> 02:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
and once Lieutenant McLean's on I'll
 
02:19:17.330 --> 02:19:17.340 align:start position:0%
have her introduce himself to I also
 
02:19:19.910 --> 02:19:19.920 align:start position:0%
have um and some of you may well know um
 
02:19:22.969 --> 02:19:22.979 align:start position:0%
uh retire Captain uh Tim Dunleavy
 
02:19:25.549 --> 02:19:25.559 align:start position:0%
who was in the position prior to me
 
02:19:27.830 --> 02:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
um he is retired but he has been nice
 
02:19:29.389 --> 02:19:29.399 align:start position:0%
enough just like many other state
 
02:19:31.009 --> 02:19:31.019 align:start position:0%
employees to go back and work part-time
 
02:19:33.530 --> 02:19:33.540 align:start position:0%
and keep all his knowledge uh give me
 
02:19:36.169 --> 02:19:36.179 align:start position:0%
all his knowledge that he has so he is
 
02:19:37.610 --> 02:19:37.620 align:start position:0%
in the back certainly if we have any
 
02:19:40.070 --> 02:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
questions and I I brought both of them
 
02:19:41.450 --> 02:19:41.460 align:start position:0%
to make sure we can answer any questions
 
02:19:43.190 --> 02:19:43.200 align:start position:0%
that you do have
 
02:19:43.200 --> 02:19:43.969 align:start position:0%
that you do have
um

02:19:43.969 --> 02:19:43.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:19:46.429 --> 02:19:46.439 align:start position:0%
uh State Police Marine Patrol is um
 
02:19:48.710 --> 02:19:48.720 align:start position:0%
obviously the we are the main agency
 
02:19:51.349 --> 02:19:51.359 align:start position:0%
within the state to for the
 
02:19:53.450 --> 02:19:53.460 align:start position:0%
responsibilities of protecting our
 
02:19:55.070 --> 02:19:55.080 align:start position:0%
Waters making sure they're safe making
 
02:19:56.510 --> 02:19:56.520 align:start position:0%
sure they're enjoyable
 
02:19:59.330 --> 02:19:59.340 align:start position:0%
and uh making sure that the people who
 
02:20:01.190 --> 02:20:01.200 align:start position:0%
not only live here or live on the lakes
 
02:20:02.990 --> 02:20:03.000 align:start position:0%
and use them every day but those who
 
02:20:04.969 --> 02:20:04.979 align:start position:0%
come to New Hampshire especially during
 
02:20:07.969 --> 02:20:07.979 align:start position:0%
the summer months can enjoy them
 
02:20:07.979 --> 02:20:08.690 align:start position:0%
the summer months can enjoy them
um

02:20:08.690 --> 02:20:08.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:20:10.730 --> 02:20:10.740 align:start position:0%
our our legislative responsibilities
 
02:20:10.740 --> 02:20:12.170 align:start position:0%
our our legislative responsibilities
include

02:20:12.170 --> 02:20:12.180 align:start position:0%
include
 
02:20:14.170 --> 02:20:14.180 align:start position:0%
um certainly law enforcement
 
02:20:16.570 --> 02:20:16.580 align:start position:0%
boating education
 
02:20:20.510 --> 02:20:20.520 align:start position:0%
our navigational Aid System uh and our
 
02:20:22.610 --> 02:20:22.620 align:start position:0%
Mooring system and I'll also add in our
 
02:20:24.170 --> 02:20:24.180 align:start position:0%
commercial licensing and Commercial
 
02:20:27.230 --> 02:20:27.240 align:start position:0%
vessel inspection unit or Insurance a
 
02:20:28.490 --> 02:20:28.500 align:start position:0%
unit but our section
 
02:20:30.490 --> 02:20:30.500 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
02:20:32.990 --> 02:20:33.000 align:start position:0%
these these things keep us quite busy
 
02:20:34.910 --> 02:20:34.920 align:start position:0%
throughout the year
 
02:20:38.090 --> 02:20:38.100 align:start position:0%
um and our law enforcement unit even
 
02:20:39.889 --> 02:20:39.899 align:start position:0%
though you would you would think it was
 
02:20:41.330 --> 02:20:41.340 align:start position:0%
just the law enforcement officers out
 
02:20:43.309 --> 02:20:43.319 align:start position:0%
there the Marine Patrol officers
 
02:20:44.990 --> 02:20:45.000 align:start position:0%
um it is all included with our
 
02:20:47.030 --> 02:20:47.040 align:start position:0%
maintenance and support staff I will say
 
02:20:48.950 --> 02:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
this about Marine Patrol is is each unit
 
02:20:50.570 --> 02:20:50.580 align:start position:0%
does not work
 
02:20:52.910 --> 02:20:52.920 align:start position:0%
um uh in the independently we all work
 
02:20:55.130 --> 02:20:55.140 align:start position:0%
together uh without one of those three
 
02:20:57.050 --> 02:20:57.060 align:start position:0%
sections right there uh we we wouldn't
 
02:20:58.630 --> 02:20:58.640 align:start position:0%
be able to get our job done every day
 
02:21:01.309 --> 02:21:01.319 align:start position:0%
our maintenance crew uh does a
 
02:21:03.889 --> 02:21:03.899 align:start position:0%
phenomenal job of keeping our 66 vessels
 
02:21:06.590 --> 02:21:06.600 align:start position:0%
that we currently have in inventory uh
 
02:21:08.750 --> 02:21:08.760 align:start position:0%
up and ready to go every day all day
 
02:21:10.730 --> 02:21:10.740 align:start position:0%
long including today
 
02:21:12.530 --> 02:21:12.540 align:start position:0%
um I will say this and you'll see this
 
02:21:14.450 --> 02:21:14.460 align:start position:0%
later in one of the uh one of the one of
 
02:21:15.830 --> 02:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
the photos is we do have three
 
02:21:18.050 --> 02:21:18.060 align:start position:0%
maintenance positions right now we only
 
02:21:20.090 --> 02:21:20.100 align:start position:0%
have one filled two of them shortly
 
02:21:22.670 --> 02:21:22.680 align:start position:0%
after I came on decided to retire I'm
 
02:21:25.070 --> 02:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
hoping that wasn't because of me uh our
 
02:21:27.050 --> 02:21:27.060 align:start position:0%
our supervisor mechanic was around for
 
02:21:28.250 --> 02:21:28.260 align:start position:0%
35 years
 
02:21:30.889 --> 02:21:30.899 align:start position:0%
um luckily similar to miss to Captain
 
02:21:33.110 --> 02:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
Dunleavy he is in the process of trying
 
02:21:35.389 --> 02:21:35.399 align:start position:0%
to come back to us to do some uh some
 
02:21:38.809 --> 02:21:38.819 align:start position:0%
work for us so our one mechanic who has
 
02:21:40.550 --> 02:21:40.560 align:start position:0%
been left for the last several months is
 
02:21:41.990 --> 02:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
doing a phenomenal job he's one of those
 
02:21:43.250 --> 02:21:43.260 align:start position:0%
guys you walk in the office every day
 
02:21:44.870 --> 02:21:44.880 align:start position:0%
he's always got a smile on his face even
 
02:21:46.010 --> 02:21:46.020 align:start position:0%
though if he's doing the work of three
 
02:21:48.830 --> 02:21:48.840 align:start position:0%
people our support staff obviously we
 
02:21:51.650 --> 02:21:51.660 align:start position:0%
have a um we have our own budget within
 
02:21:53.570 --> 02:21:53.580 align:start position:0%
Marine Patrol we have we do our own
 
02:21:55.910 --> 02:21:55.920 align:start position:0%
hiring we do our own training and with
 
02:21:57.950 --> 02:21:57.960 align:start position:0%
all the new law enforcement duties out
 
02:21:59.450 --> 02:21:59.460 align:start position:0%
there and training that's required by
 
02:22:02.330 --> 02:22:02.340 align:start position:0%
the state and the federal government we
 
02:22:03.830 --> 02:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
need to keep track of all that so there
 
02:22:06.710 --> 02:22:06.720 align:start position:0%
is a lot to do and our entire team works
 
02:22:09.770 --> 02:22:09.780 align:start position:0%
works together uh every day
 
02:22:11.690 --> 02:22:11.700 align:start position:0%
our law enforcement our Marine Patrol
 
02:22:14.870 --> 02:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
officers uh work around the state year
 
02:22:14.880 --> 02:22:15.650 align:start position:0%
officers uh work around the state year
round

02:22:15.650 --> 02:22:15.660 align:start position:0%
round
 
02:22:18.170 --> 02:22:18.180 align:start position:0%
um and I say year-round uh while I was
 
02:22:20.570 --> 02:22:20.580 align:start position:0%
in the back there I was just checking
 
02:22:22.610 --> 02:22:22.620 align:start position:0%
um we have one uh two of our officers
 
02:22:23.870 --> 02:22:23.880 align:start position:0%
out on one of our boats out on the ocean
 
02:22:26.750 --> 02:22:26.760 align:start position:0%
right now we do we do Patrol 12 months
 
02:22:29.210 --> 02:22:29.220 align:start position:0%
out of the year in fact in the last
 
02:22:30.110 --> 02:22:30.120 align:start position:0%
several weeks we've been on
 
02:22:31.670 --> 02:22:31.680 align:start position:0%
Winnipesaukee probably for the first
 
02:22:35.150 --> 02:22:35.160 align:start position:0%
time in January in many years so much
 
02:22:36.889 --> 02:22:36.899 align:start position:0%
that it hit Facebook and people were
 
02:22:38.210 --> 02:22:38.220 align:start position:0%
quite surprised that we were out there
 
02:22:40.130 --> 02:22:40.140 align:start position:0%
but our job is not to just be out there
 
02:22:41.510 --> 02:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
stopping boats and checking for
 
02:22:43.550 --> 02:22:43.560 align:start position:0%
registrations but our just our job is to
 
02:22:45.469 --> 02:22:45.479 align:start position:0%
be out there for safety looking around
 
02:22:47.030 --> 02:22:47.040 align:start position:0%
the shorelines making sure things aren't
 
02:22:49.550 --> 02:22:49.560 align:start position:0%
floating in the waters uh in the past of
 
02:22:52.070 --> 02:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
of other boats that are going by quite a
 
02:22:54.469 --> 02:22:54.479 align:start position:0%
few of the commercial vehicles and
 
02:22:56.030 --> 02:22:56.040 align:start position:0%
companies that work on the islands on
 
02:22:57.950 --> 02:22:57.960 align:start position:0%
Winnipesaukee are actually getting quite
 
02:23:00.110 --> 02:23:00.120 align:start position:0%
a bit of work done which they were a
 
02:23:01.550 --> 02:23:01.560 align:start position:0%
little bit surprised to see us because
 
02:23:02.950 --> 02:23:02.960 align:start position:0%
the registrations
 
02:23:05.870 --> 02:23:05.880 align:start position:0%
but we're not about out there but just
 
02:23:06.950 --> 02:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
enforcement we're about there about
 
02:23:09.170 --> 02:23:09.180 align:start position:0%
education so we've had some contact with
 
02:23:11.570 --> 02:23:11.580 align:start position:0%
them uh funny one of them one of them
 
02:23:13.370 --> 02:23:13.380 align:start position:0%
was stop no registration I was told
 
02:23:16.010 --> 02:23:16.020 align:start position:0%
called by DMV that the next day he came
 
02:23:17.510 --> 02:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
to register his vote because he had been
 
02:23:19.250 --> 02:23:19.260 align:start position:0%
stopped after January 1st out on the
 
02:23:22.130 --> 02:23:22.140 align:start position:0%
lake which is again very rare but we
 
02:23:23.330 --> 02:23:23.340 align:start position:0%
want to make sure everyone knows that
 
02:23:24.770 --> 02:23:24.780 align:start position:0%
we're out there doing our job 12 months
 
02:23:25.849 --> 02:23:25.859 align:start position:0%
out of the year
 
02:23:25.859 --> 02:23:27.230 align:start position:0%
out of the year
uh

02:23:27.230 --> 02:23:27.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:23:30.230 --> 02:23:30.240 align:start position:0%
there are approximately 975 lakes in
 
02:23:32.809 --> 02:23:32.819 align:start position:0%
this this state and uh where our
 
02:23:35.510 --> 02:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction is any uh any body of water
 
02:23:37.490 --> 02:23:37.500 align:start position:0%
over 10 acres that's within the state in
 
02:23:38.870 --> 02:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
the borders of New Hampshire whether
 
02:23:41.330 --> 02:23:41.340 align:start position:0%
it's man-made private or public so that
 
02:23:43.610 --> 02:23:43.620 align:start position:0%
that's quite a few Lakes we do Patrol
 
02:23:46.429 --> 02:23:46.439 align:start position:0%
about 265 of those the rest of those are
 
02:23:48.950 --> 02:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
either an accessible uh can't get boats
 
02:23:50.450 --> 02:23:50.460 align:start position:0%
into them they don't have not
 
02:23:52.370 --> 02:23:52.380 align:start position:0%
necessarily lakes that allow motors on
 
02:23:54.650 --> 02:23:54.660 align:start position:0%
them so we do less enforcement on those
 
02:23:56.570 --> 02:23:56.580 align:start position:0%
and plus with the larger Lakes we have I
 
02:23:57.889 --> 02:23:57.899 align:start position:0%
did notice that some of you were from
 
02:23:59.450 --> 02:23:59.460 align:start position:0%
the districts that have some of our
 
02:24:01.610 --> 02:24:01.620 align:start position:0%
larger Lakes so you're probably quite
 
02:24:03.650 --> 02:24:03.660 align:start position:0%
familiar maybe more familiar with what
 
02:24:05.929 --> 02:24:05.939 align:start position:0%
we do but everybody I'm sure has water
 
02:24:08.330 --> 02:24:08.340 align:start position:0%
in their district and we're basically
 
02:24:10.969 --> 02:24:10.979 align:start position:0%
responsible for that water
 
02:24:13.010 --> 02:24:13.020 align:start position:0%
um our our Law Enforcement Officers
 
02:24:14.750 --> 02:24:14.760 align:start position:0%
themselves basically break up into three
 
02:24:16.429 --> 02:24:16.439 align:start position:0%
categories both to fixed and field
 
02:24:18.530 --> 02:24:18.540 align:start position:0%
patrols our field patrols although
 
02:24:20.270 --> 02:24:20.280 align:start position:0%
mostly those seasonal officers who get
 
02:24:22.969 --> 02:24:22.979 align:start position:0%
uh get a get a boat for the summer they
 
02:24:24.770 --> 02:24:24.780 align:start position:0%
drive around from Lake to Lake River to
 
02:24:26.990 --> 02:24:27.000 align:start position:0%
River and Patrol most of them are uh the
 
02:24:28.429 --> 02:24:28.439 align:start position:0%
seasonals they drive around their own
 
02:24:30.230 --> 02:24:30.240 align:start position:0%
personal vehicles they get them to the
 
02:24:31.849 --> 02:24:31.859 align:start position:0%
lakes and rivers they do the patrols and
 
02:24:33.290 --> 02:24:33.300 align:start position:0%
they go home at the end of the day our
 
02:24:35.210 --> 02:24:35.220 align:start position:0%
other two are the fix fixed patrols
 
02:24:37.610 --> 02:24:37.620 align:start position:0%
similar to Winnipesaukee similar to
 
02:24:39.290 --> 02:24:39.300 align:start position:0%
Squam winter Squam where our boats are
 
02:24:41.389 --> 02:24:41.399 align:start position:0%
on those Lakes docked all year long
 
02:24:43.730 --> 02:24:43.740 align:start position:0%
available at any time for officers to go
 
02:24:45.889 --> 02:24:45.899 align:start position:0%
and get onto them those officers are
 
02:24:47.570 --> 02:24:47.580 align:start position:0%
dedicated to those lakes and they're
 
02:24:49.490 --> 02:24:49.500 align:start position:0%
very very familiar with those Lakes the
 
02:24:50.870 --> 02:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
other one as I was just mentioning was
 
02:24:51.770 --> 02:24:51.780 align:start position:0%
our ocean
 
02:24:55.309 --> 02:24:55.319 align:start position:0%
uh we do have a vote that we we docked
 
02:24:56.870 --> 02:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
down at the coast guard as well as
 
02:24:59.030 --> 02:24:59.040 align:start position:0%
Hampton docks in our summertime so we
 
02:25:00.290 --> 02:25:00.300 align:start position:0%
have two boats during the summer time
 
02:25:02.090 --> 02:25:02.100 align:start position:0%
one during the winter time
 
02:25:03.650 --> 02:25:03.660 align:start position:0%
um and that keeps our that keeps our
 
02:25:05.570 --> 02:25:05.580 align:start position:0%
field area our field patrols going
 
02:25:08.270 --> 02:25:08.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:10.370 --> 02:25:10.380 align:start position:0%
um we Patrol the waterways we enforce
 
02:25:13.370 --> 02:25:13.380 align:start position:0%
boating laws we respond to uh calls for
 
02:25:15.770 --> 02:25:15.780 align:start position:0%
service uh emergencies or
 
02:25:18.469 --> 02:25:18.479 align:start position:0%
non-emergencies we might work very
 
02:25:21.050 --> 02:25:21.060 align:start position:0%
closely uh with fish and game
 
02:25:24.230 --> 02:25:24.240 align:start position:0%
um who is just here uh we support them
 
02:25:26.210 --> 02:25:26.220 align:start position:0%
they support us and we actually work
 
02:25:27.530 --> 02:25:27.540 align:start position:0%
very closely they also have one of their
 
02:25:30.110 --> 02:25:30.120 align:start position:0%
boats on our docks at the lake Lake
 
02:25:31.969 --> 02:25:31.979 align:start position:0%
Winnipesaukee so we see them quite often
 
02:25:34.070 --> 02:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
we also provide Homeland Security
 
02:25:36.830 --> 02:25:36.840 align:start position:0%
especially down on the coast we after 9
 
02:25:39.290 --> 02:25:39.300 align:start position:0%
11 the federal government decided that a
 
02:25:41.510 --> 02:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
lot of our infrastructure needed that
 
02:25:44.270 --> 02:25:44.280 align:start position:0%
support needed that Patrol we have LPG
 
02:25:47.770 --> 02:25:47.780 align:start position:0%
tankers coming in we have U.S Navy ships
 
02:25:49.910 --> 02:25:49.920 align:start position:0%
submarines coming in
 
02:25:52.670 --> 02:25:52.680 align:start position:0%
uh throughout the year to the Naval
 
02:25:55.490 --> 02:25:55.500 align:start position:0%
Shipyard and we are asked by the U.S
 
02:25:57.170 --> 02:25:57.180 align:start position:0%
Coast Guard whose primary jurisdictions
 
02:25:59.210 --> 02:25:59.220 align:start position:0%
with those vessels to assist them with
 
02:26:01.670 --> 02:26:01.680 align:start position:0%
Patrol and and support as those days
 
02:26:04.190 --> 02:26:04.200 align:start position:0%
they come into our Harbors uh we also do
 
02:26:06.170 --> 02:26:06.180 align:start position:0%
maintenance of our navigation system and
 
02:26:08.150 --> 02:26:08.160 align:start position:0%
we also do commercial operating
 
02:26:09.770 --> 02:26:09.780 align:start position:0%
uh testing as well as commercial
 
02:26:12.290 --> 02:26:12.300 align:start position:0%
vegetable inspections we do about 500
 
02:26:14.870 --> 02:26:14.880 align:start position:0%
vessels and about five to six hundred
 
02:26:17.750 --> 02:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
commercial tests each year
 
02:26:18.950 --> 02:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
um you would think of a commercial
 
02:26:21.170 --> 02:26:21.180 align:start position:0%
vehicle such as a large boat maybe a
 
02:26:22.849 --> 02:26:22.859 align:start position:0%
tourism boat but these go all the way
 
02:26:24.290 --> 02:26:24.300 align:start position:0%
down to the smaller boats that have just
 
02:26:27.530 --> 02:26:27.540 align:start position:0%
engines on them from camps that the camp
 
02:26:29.150 --> 02:26:29.160 align:start position:0%
counselors would get the kids out on the
 
02:26:31.130 --> 02:26:31.140 align:start position:0%
water maybe to it maybe to a an island
 
02:26:32.750 --> 02:26:32.760 align:start position:0%
or to go out and do something for the
 
02:26:34.309 --> 02:26:34.319 align:start position:0%
day that is considered a commercial
 
02:26:36.830 --> 02:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
vessel so that needs to be inspected and
 
02:26:38.450 --> 02:26:38.460 align:start position:0%
those operators need to have a license a
 
02:26:40.670 --> 02:26:40.680 align:start position:0%
commercial license to do starting that
 
02:26:42.050 --> 02:26:42.060 align:start position:0%
was kind of my first introduction to
 
02:26:43.309 --> 02:26:43.319 align:start position:0%
Marine Patrol when I got there back in
 
02:26:46.010 --> 02:26:46.020 align:start position:0%
May that's when all those those camps
 
02:26:47.450 --> 02:26:47.460 align:start position:0%
start coming in those Camp counselors
 
02:26:50.389 --> 02:26:50.399 align:start position:0%
the camp owners uh come into Marine
 
02:26:52.429 --> 02:26:52.439 align:start position:0%
Patrol May and June and you might not
 
02:26:53.929 --> 02:26:53.939 align:start position:0%
have time to really talk to us too much
 
02:26:56.570 --> 02:26:56.580 align:start position:0%
because the staff there is is basically
 
02:26:58.610 --> 02:26:58.620 align:start position:0%
running all day long trying to take care
 
02:27:00.110 --> 02:27:00.120 align:start position:0%
of all the people coming in to try to
 
02:27:03.110 --> 02:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
get their their licensing and vessels
 
02:27:03.120 --> 02:27:04.490 align:start position:0%
get their their licensing and vessels
inspected

02:27:04.490 --> 02:27:04.500 align:start position:0%
inspected
 
02:27:04.500 --> 02:27:05.150 align:start position:0%
inspected
um

02:27:05.150 --> 02:27:05.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:27:08.330 --> 02:27:08.340 align:start position:0%
love no um obviously I talked about the
 
02:27:10.610 --> 02:27:10.620 align:start position:0%
Seacoast there's only 21 20 miles of
 
02:27:12.650 --> 02:27:12.660 align:start position:0%
shoreline between Massachusetts and
 
02:27:14.809 --> 02:27:14.819 align:start position:0%
Maine that New Hampshire but we have
 
02:27:16.969 --> 02:27:16.979 align:start position:0%
about 158 miles of Shoreline so if you
 
02:27:19.130 --> 02:27:19.140 align:start position:0%
go up oh up the Lakes up I mean up the
 
02:27:22.190 --> 02:27:22.200 align:start position:0%
river uh there's quite a bit to do on
 
02:27:23.510 --> 02:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
one of the few patrols I've been able to
 
02:27:25.070 --> 02:27:25.080 align:start position:0%
do out there with Sergeant O'Connor who
 
02:27:28.250 --> 02:27:28.260 align:start position:0%
is our ocean supervisor
 
02:27:31.309 --> 02:27:31.319 align:start position:0%
um we probably touched maybe 25 of of
 
02:27:33.110 --> 02:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
the areas that that we have to patrol
 
02:27:35.750 --> 02:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
down there it takes quite a bit
 
02:27:37.730 --> 02:27:37.740 align:start position:0%
um and you don't just drive at a high
 
02:27:39.590 --> 02:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
speed up and down up and down the river
 
02:27:41.030 --> 02:27:41.040 align:start position:0%
you have to take it slow you have to
 
02:27:43.130 --> 02:27:43.140 align:start position:0%
really do your Patrol so this takes
 
02:27:45.650 --> 02:27:45.660 align:start position:0%
quite a bit of time to do um we work
 
02:27:47.330 --> 02:27:47.340 align:start position:0%
very closely and I mean very closely
 
02:27:49.190 --> 02:27:49.200 align:start position:0%
with the United States Coast Guard
 
02:27:50.809 --> 02:27:50.819 align:start position:0%
um a good portion of our funding also
 
02:27:52.070 --> 02:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
comes from the Coast Guard Coast Guard
 
02:27:54.130 --> 02:27:54.140 align:start position:0%
is responsible for recreational boating
 
02:27:56.929 --> 02:27:56.939 align:start position:0%
uh the recreational boating industry in
 
02:27:59.090 --> 02:27:59.100 align:start position:0%
the United States so they are the ones
 
02:27:59.100 --> 02:28:00.110 align:start position:0%
the United States so they are the ones
who

02:28:00.110 --> 02:28:00.120 align:start position:0%
who
 
02:28:03.290 --> 02:28:03.300 align:start position:0%
um give a large portion of uh of of the
 
02:28:05.870 --> 02:28:05.880 align:start position:0%
funds to all the states
 
02:28:07.250 --> 02:28:07.260 align:start position:0%
um we work very closely with them we're
 
02:28:08.270 --> 02:28:08.280 align:start position:0%
there every day we actually have an
 
02:28:11.090 --> 02:28:11.100 align:start position:0%
office uh out there at the Coast Guard
 
02:28:11.100 --> 02:28:12.349 align:start position:0%
office uh out there at the Coast Guard
Station

02:28:12.349 --> 02:28:12.359 align:start position:0%
Station
 
02:28:14.870 --> 02:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
um and uh we're there every day so they
 
02:28:16.190 --> 02:28:16.200 align:start position:0%
asked for our assistance we asked for
 
02:28:17.690 --> 02:28:17.700 align:start position:0%
their assistance and it's it's a good
 
02:28:23.270 --> 02:28:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:27.469 --> 02:28:27.479 align:start position:0%
so the um uh one of the several of the
 
02:28:29.570 --> 02:28:29.580 align:start position:0%
the larger sections I would like to talk
 
02:28:30.770 --> 02:28:30.780 align:start position:0%
about is
 
02:28:33.770 --> 02:28:33.780 align:start position:0%
um both both our um our navigation and
 
02:28:35.809 --> 02:28:35.819 align:start position:0%
our Mooring section our navigation
 
02:28:35.819 --> 02:28:37.010 align:start position:0%
our Mooring section our navigation
section

02:28:37.010 --> 02:28:37.020 align:start position:0%
section
 
02:28:38.570 --> 02:28:38.580 align:start position:0%
um is uh
 
02:28:41.809 --> 02:28:41.819 align:start position:0%
is we make our own buoys at our at our
 
02:28:44.809 --> 02:28:44.819 align:start position:0%
office we we purchase all the um
 
02:28:47.210 --> 02:28:47.220 align:start position:0%
uh we purchase all the supplies our
 
02:28:48.889 --> 02:28:48.899 align:start position:0%
mechanics our people there put all that
 
02:28:50.929 --> 02:28:50.939 align:start position:0%
stuff together we have over 2 000 buoys
 
02:28:52.490 --> 02:28:52.500 align:start position:0%
and navigational markers throughout the
 
02:28:55.010 --> 02:28:55.020 align:start position:0%
state obviously um one something happens
 
02:28:56.870 --> 02:28:56.880 align:start position:0%
to one up in in the North Country we
 
02:28:58.010 --> 02:28:58.020 align:start position:0%
have to send someone all the way up
 
02:28:59.270 --> 02:28:59.280 align:start position:0%
there to do it
 
02:29:00.650 --> 02:29:00.660 align:start position:0%
um and and I know I'm kind of getting
 
02:29:02.090 --> 02:29:02.100 align:start position:0%
off of this but I know you're shorthand
 
02:29:03.469 --> 02:29:03.479 align:start position:0%
and I mean I know you're short for time
 
02:29:05.990 --> 02:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
but I I want to hit some major points
 
02:29:07.490 --> 02:29:07.500 align:start position:0%
um and the reason I want to bring up the
 
02:29:09.650 --> 02:29:09.660 align:start position:0%
navigation and going up the north
 
02:29:11.630 --> 02:29:11.640 align:start position:0%
um we don't have a lot of manpower to go
 
02:29:13.910 --> 02:29:13.920 align:start position:0%
up and do that with of actually bringing
 
02:29:17.210 --> 02:29:17.220 align:start position:0%
back one of our um one of our our
 
02:29:19.849 --> 02:29:19.859 align:start position:0%
supervisor mechanic who just left us and
 
02:29:21.050 --> 02:29:21.060 align:start position:0%
he's going to come back and try to help
 
02:29:22.849 --> 02:29:22.859 align:start position:0%
us with that last year when I got there
 
02:29:24.830 --> 02:29:24.840 align:start position:0%
I realized a lot of the officers were
 
02:29:27.530 --> 02:29:27.540 align:start position:0%
out dealing with Moorings
 
02:29:29.630 --> 02:29:29.640 align:start position:0%
um and and navigational buoys trying to
 
02:29:31.670 --> 02:29:31.680 align:start position:0%
fix them get them put back into the
 
02:29:33.710 --> 02:29:33.720 align:start position:0%
water that's taking time off of the
 
02:29:35.450 --> 02:29:35.460 align:start position:0%
officers time to be actually on the
 
02:29:37.010 --> 02:29:37.020 align:start position:0%
waters patrolling so we're actually
 
02:29:38.270 --> 02:29:38.280 align:start position:0%
going to try to try to bring them some
 
02:29:40.309 --> 02:29:40.319 align:start position:0%
part-time seasonal help to specifically
 
02:29:42.050 --> 02:29:42.060 align:start position:0%
go and do that
 
02:29:43.550 --> 02:29:43.560 align:start position:0%
um one of my sergeants last year had to
 
02:29:44.750 --> 02:29:44.760 align:start position:0%
take an entire day
 
02:29:46.969 --> 02:29:46.979 align:start position:0%
live up to Lake and begog to fix two
 
02:29:49.490 --> 02:29:49.500 align:start position:0%
buoys and to come all the way back so
 
02:29:51.650 --> 02:29:51.660 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of these these little um
 
02:29:53.210 --> 02:29:53.220 align:start position:0%
these things that a lot of people don't
 
02:29:55.010 --> 02:29:55.020 align:start position:0%
see that we're trying we're trying to
 
02:29:56.809 --> 02:29:56.819 align:start position:0%
work on and try to use our Manpower the
 
02:29:58.429 --> 02:29:58.439 align:start position:0%
best we can
 
02:30:01.010 --> 02:30:01.020 align:start position:0%
um we have again we have over 2 000 both
 
02:30:03.410 --> 02:30:03.420 align:start position:0%
buoys lights and regulatory signs
 
02:30:05.030 --> 02:30:05.040 align:start position:0%
throughout the uh throughout the state
 
02:30:07.550 --> 02:30:07.560 align:start position:0%
on mostly the larger Lakes but you'll
 
02:30:10.190 --> 02:30:10.200 align:start position:0%
also see them on the smaller Lakes
 
02:30:10.200 --> 02:30:10.849 align:start position:0%
also see them on the smaller Lakes
um

02:30:10.849 --> 02:30:10.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:30:14.270 --> 02:30:14.280 align:start position:0%
good yeah
 
02:30:16.309 --> 02:30:16.319 align:start position:0%
our Mooring section so our Moorings
 
02:30:17.510 --> 02:30:17.520 align:start position:0%
actually takes up quite a bit of our
 
02:30:19.190 --> 02:30:19.200 align:start position:0%
time there's eight Lakes within the
 
02:30:21.050 --> 02:30:21.060 align:start position:0%
state that have to have if you want to
 
02:30:22.550 --> 02:30:22.560 align:start position:0%
have a mooring for your boat you do need
 
02:30:23.929 --> 02:30:23.939 align:start position:0%
to have a permit
 
02:30:26.210 --> 02:30:26.220 align:start position:0%
uh you have to put an application we
 
02:30:28.190 --> 02:30:28.200 align:start position:0%
review it and I'm very strict about
 
02:30:29.570 --> 02:30:29.580 align:start position:0%
reviewing it and trying to look at the
 
02:30:30.889 --> 02:30:30.899 align:start position:0%
rules and the laws
 
02:30:32.750 --> 02:30:32.760 align:start position:0%
the little Preamble in front of the law
 
02:30:34.610 --> 02:30:34.620 align:start position:0%
for for Moorings actually states that
 
02:30:37.250 --> 02:30:37.260 align:start position:0%
the legislature actually put put this
 
02:30:39.410 --> 02:30:39.420 align:start position:0%
law into place so the Moorings are not
 
02:30:41.389 --> 02:30:41.399 align:start position:0%
dotting our shorelines
 
02:30:43.550 --> 02:30:43.560 align:start position:0%
um and causing a navigational Hazard or
 
02:30:45.410 --> 02:30:45.420 align:start position:0%
as well as just a visual
 
02:30:48.290 --> 02:30:48.300 align:start position:0%
um issues but at the same time if you
 
02:30:51.170 --> 02:30:51.180 align:start position:0%
own if you won't own a boat and you
 
02:30:52.370 --> 02:30:52.380 align:start position:0%
don't really have a dock system where
 
02:30:54.830 --> 02:30:54.840 align:start position:0%
you have a poor Shoreline to do it you
 
02:30:57.830 --> 02:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
need the place to put that boat so uh
 
02:30:59.570 --> 02:30:59.580 align:start position:0%
this takes up a lot of our time during
 
02:31:02.389 --> 02:31:02.399 align:start position:0%
the summer there's about 5
 
02:31:04.670 --> 02:31:04.680 align:start position:0%
000 Moorings out there within the state
 
02:31:06.650 --> 02:31:06.660 align:start position:0%
about we get about 2 500 applications
 
02:31:08.030 --> 02:31:08.040 align:start position:0%
each year
 
02:31:09.650 --> 02:31:09.660 align:start position:0%
um and then you uh you renew every year
 
02:31:13.910 --> 02:31:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:16.490 --> 02:31:16.500 align:start position:0%
um so uh last big portion of is our
 
02:31:19.070 --> 02:31:19.080 align:start position:0%
border education so last year we handed
 
02:31:22.010 --> 02:31:22.020 align:start position:0%
out about 8 000 boater certificates
 
02:31:23.750 --> 02:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
they're not licenses they're voter
 
02:31:25.790 --> 02:31:25.800 align:start position:0%
certificates you can either take this
 
02:31:27.889 --> 02:31:27.899 align:start position:0%
class in person and take a test at the
 
02:31:29.150 --> 02:31:29.160 align:start position:0%
end of the day or you can actually study
 
02:31:31.730 --> 02:31:31.740 align:start position:0%
online and take it on uh and come into a
 
02:31:33.770 --> 02:31:33.780 align:start position:0%
proctored exam you can also do a test
 
02:31:35.570 --> 02:31:35.580 align:start position:0%
out which we only had about six of those
 
02:31:37.490 --> 02:31:37.500 align:start position:0%
last year meaning you think you have
 
02:31:38.750 --> 02:31:38.760 align:start position:0%
enough knowledge to do this you've been
 
02:31:40.969 --> 02:31:40.979 align:start position:0%
doing it for maybe a lifetime and you
 
02:31:42.830 --> 02:31:42.840 align:start position:0%
can come in and you can test out we also
 
02:31:44.630 --> 02:31:44.640 align:start position:0%
have a 14-day agent program which if
 
02:31:46.130 --> 02:31:46.140 align:start position:0%
you're a visitor to the state you've
 
02:31:47.630 --> 02:31:47.640 align:start position:0%
never really been on the water but you
 
02:31:49.429 --> 02:31:49.439 align:start position:0%
decided you want to rent a boat you can
 
02:31:52.309 --> 02:31:52.319 align:start position:0%
come in one of our Mooring our permit
 
02:31:55.309 --> 02:31:55.319 align:start position:0%
agents mostly the marinas look at the
 
02:31:56.990 --> 02:31:57.000 align:start position:0%
look at the computer study a little bit
 
02:31:58.429 --> 02:31:58.439 align:start position:0%
and you take a test at the end and
 
02:32:00.250 --> 02:32:00.260 align:start position:0%
you'll you'll receive a 14-day
 
02:32:02.870 --> 02:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
certificate which is only good for those
 
02:32:04.190 --> 02:32:04.200 align:start position:0%
14 days while you're here in New
 
02:32:06.590 --> 02:32:06.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so you can safely operate or
 
02:32:09.349 --> 02:32:09.359 align:start position:0%
boat our biggest thing is just safety
 
02:32:11.030 --> 02:32:11.040 align:start position:0%
and education that's what we're there
 
02:32:13.429 --> 02:32:13.439 align:start position:0%
for although we do enforcement um
 
02:32:14.750 --> 02:32:14.760 align:start position:0%
obviously we want to make sure
 
02:32:17.450 --> 02:32:17.460 align:start position:0%
everybody's safe there's a lot of a lot
 
02:32:19.550 --> 02:32:19.560 align:start position:0%
of young kids a lot of new boaters out
 
02:32:22.130 --> 02:32:22.140 align:start position:0%
there and if you've my first experience
 
02:32:24.050 --> 02:32:24.060 align:start position:0%
on Lake Winnipesaukee if you've never
 
02:32:26.030 --> 02:32:26.040 align:start position:0%
been out there on a boat you may look at
 
02:32:27.650 --> 02:32:27.660 align:start position:0%
it from the hills and the mountains are
 
02:32:30.110 --> 02:32:30.120 align:start position:0%
driving by I suggest you go out there
 
02:32:31.550 --> 02:32:31.560 align:start position:0%
someday and it's it's a whole new
 
02:32:33.110 --> 02:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
experience if you're actually hot on the
 
02:32:33.120 --> 02:32:39.050 align:start position:0%
experience if you're actually hot on the
water

02:32:39.050 --> 02:32:39.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:41.210 --> 02:32:41.220 align:start position:0%
the last thing is I'm just going to show
 
02:32:42.950 --> 02:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
you just talk about real quickly just
 
02:32:44.270 --> 02:32:44.280 align:start position:0%
some of the things we're working on some
 
02:32:46.130 --> 02:32:46.140 align:start position:0%
of the projects and some of our issues
 
02:32:48.650 --> 02:32:48.660 align:start position:0%
that are going on there is a there is a
 
02:32:53.330 --> 02:32:53.340 align:start position:0%
a bill currently in to have a a
 
02:32:54.770 --> 02:32:54.780 align:start position:0%
committee put together
 
02:32:58.969 --> 02:32:58.979 align:start position:0%
to study the vessel numbering rules as
 
02:33:00.590 --> 02:33:00.600 align:start position:0%
well as registration fees so currently
 
02:33:02.929 --> 02:33:02.939 align:start position:0%
we take in money through registration
 
02:33:04.550 --> 02:33:04.560 align:start position:0%

02:33:06.830 --> 02:33:06.840 align:start position:0%
agencies by the U.S Coast Guard

regulations

02:33:08.050 --> 02:33:08.060 align:start position:0%
regulations
 
02:33:11.690 --> 02:33:11.700 align:start position:0%
that that can't be done they are working
 
02:33:13.130 --> 02:33:13.140 align:start position:0%
with us to try to get that done there
 
02:33:14.570 --> 02:33:14.580 align:start position:0%
are several other states that are also
 
02:33:16.250 --> 02:33:16.260 align:start position:0%
having that issue so we've actually
 
02:33:18.170 --> 02:33:18.180 align:start position:0%
talked directly with U.S Coast Guard and
 
02:33:19.309 --> 02:33:19.319 align:start position:0%
these other states to try to come up
 
02:33:21.050 --> 02:33:21.060 align:start position:0%
with a solution to try to find and
 
02:33:23.889 --> 02:33:23.899 align:start position:0%
mostly this is uh
 
02:33:25.730 --> 02:33:25.740 align:start position:0%
environmental safe Environmental
 
02:33:28.370 --> 02:33:28.380 align:start position:0%
Services search and rescue for fish and
 
02:33:30.889 --> 02:33:30.899 align:start position:0%
game and uh Port Authority down down in
 
02:33:32.570 --> 02:33:32.580 align:start position:0%
the Portsmouth area so we're trying to
 
02:33:33.770 --> 02:33:33.780 align:start position:0%
work on that and they're going to be
 
02:33:35.510 --> 02:33:35.520 align:start position:0%
trying to come up with a study committee
 
02:33:37.790 --> 02:33:37.800 align:start position:0%
to do that we do have a large doc
 
02:33:39.950 --> 02:33:39.960 align:start position:0%
project at our building our dock down on
 
02:33:42.170 --> 02:33:42.180 align:start position:0%
our building is 30 years old it's not
 
02:33:44.210 --> 02:33:44.220 align:start position:0%
cheap to replace we put it out once
 
02:33:46.010 --> 02:33:46.020 align:start position:0%
we've had to rebid it
 
02:33:47.990 --> 02:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
um and we're hoping to get that done for
 
02:33:49.730 --> 02:33:49.740 align:start position:0%
for next winter whereas our entire doc
 
02:33:52.250 --> 02:33:52.260 align:start position:0%
system is going to be taken out and and
 
02:33:55.130 --> 02:33:55.140 align:start position:0%
changed up we
 
02:33:56.870 --> 02:33:56.880 align:start position:0%
Recruitment and Retention like everybody
 
02:33:59.210 --> 02:33:59.220 align:start position:0%
else talks about I think we're good at
 
02:34:01.190 --> 02:34:01.200 align:start position:0%
retention I think we're we're having a
 
02:34:03.349 --> 02:34:03.359 align:start position:0%
hard time with recruitment currently we
 
02:34:05.150 --> 02:34:05.160 align:start position:0%
only have about 26 seasonal officers
 
02:34:07.370 --> 02:34:07.380 align:start position:0%
that's historically low in this in this
 
02:34:10.730 --> 02:34:10.740 align:start position:0%
unit we have numbers of um uh we used to
 
02:34:13.610 --> 02:34:13.620 align:start position:0%
be in the 80 90 to 100 number range of
 
02:34:16.370 --> 02:34:16.380 align:start position:0%
seasonal officers now last year we had
 
02:34:17.929 --> 02:34:17.939 align:start position:0%
26 we're probably going to be in that
 
02:34:19.790 --> 02:34:19.800 align:start position:0%
range again this year with with 10
 
02:34:22.070 --> 02:34:22.080 align:start position:0%
full-time officers so not a lot to go
 
02:34:23.990 --> 02:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
around to patrol in the state and the
 
02:34:26.150 --> 02:34:26.160 align:start position:0%
last thing is we we do a uh we are doing
 
02:34:28.790 --> 02:34:28.800 align:start position:0%
a a program with the troopers on the
 
02:34:31.130 --> 02:34:31.140 align:start position:0%
road many of whom actually started with
 
02:34:32.690 --> 02:34:32.700 align:start position:0%
Marine Patrol so they have the knowledge
 
02:34:34.309 --> 02:34:34.319 align:start position:0%
they're coming back in they're helping
 
02:34:36.910 --> 02:34:36.920 align:start position:0%
us do patrols that's augmenting our our
 
02:34:38.929 --> 02:34:38.939 align:start position:0%
patrols a little bit
 
02:34:40.370 --> 02:34:40.380 align:start position:0%
um it's been it's been a huge success
 
02:34:42.050 --> 02:34:42.060 align:start position:0%
last year was great we're trying to
 
02:34:44.750 --> 02:34:44.760 align:start position:0%
improve upon that this year so we are
 
02:34:46.550 --> 02:34:46.560 align:start position:0%
busy we are 12 months out of the Year
 
02:34:48.290 --> 02:34:48.300 align:start position:0%
everyone thinks kind of things slow down
 
02:34:51.349 --> 02:34:51.359 align:start position:0%
after after uh after the fall which they
 
02:34:52.969 --> 02:34:52.979 align:start position:0%
do maybe on the water but it certainly
 
02:34:54.590 --> 02:34:54.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't do that for the Marine Patrol
 
02:34:54.600 --> 02:34:56.090 align:start position:0%
doesn't do that for the Marine Patrol
Bureau

02:34:56.090 --> 02:34:56.100 align:start position:0%
Bureau
 
02:34:58.070 --> 02:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
um you do have handouts on the bottom of
 
02:35:01.370 --> 02:35:01.380 align:start position:0%
that is our phone number as well as our
 
02:35:03.530 --> 02:35:03.540 align:start position:0%
email address we're available anytime

them very shortly as well
 
02:35:22.730 --> 02:35:22.740 align:start position:0%
um speaking of that as you can see now
 
02:35:24.530 --> 02:35:24.540 align:start position:0%
and I think representative Sykes can
 
02:35:26.510 --> 02:35:26.520 align:start position:0%
attest one of the toughest jobs I have
 
02:35:29.210 --> 02:35:29.220 align:start position:0%
is time management sometimes you can hit
 
02:35:31.610 --> 02:35:31.620 align:start position:0%
it sometimes it don't
 
02:35:32.809 --> 02:35:32.819 align:start position:0%
um there are two other people in the
 
02:35:34.550 --> 02:35:34.560 align:start position:0%
room that I said if I had time at the
 
02:35:36.290 --> 02:35:36.300 align:start position:0%
end I would let them introduce
 
02:35:36.300 --> 02:35:37.370 align:start position:0%
end I would let them introduce
themselves

02:35:37.370 --> 02:35:37.380 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
02:35:40.070 --> 02:35:40.080 align:start position:0%
I don't have time but I'm still going to
 
02:35:41.929 --> 02:35:41.939 align:start position:0%
let you introduce yourselves briefly
 
02:35:52.730 --> 02:35:52.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:54.290 --> 02:35:54.300 align:start position:0%
um the lucky position of being the
 
02:35:55.910 --> 02:35:55.920 align:start position:0%

roadway safety
 
02:36:43.610 --> 02:36:43.620 align:start position:0%
um we'll be here very frequently talking
 
02:36:45.889 --> 02:36:45.899 align:start position:0%
about safe roads through annual
 
02:36:48.550 --> 02:36:48.560 align:start position:0%
inspections through driver's education
 
02:36:52.610 --> 02:36:52.620 align:start position:0%

two programs I'd want to mention to you
 
02:37:02.030 --> 02:37:02.040 align:start position:0%
I do have a handout that's going to
 
02:37:03.590 --> 02:37:03.600 align:start position:0%
summarize all this stuff and importantly
 
02:37:05.690 --> 02:37:05.700 align:start position:0%
it has my contact information my cell
 
02:37:08.690 --> 02:37:08.700 align:start position:0%
phone number email any any information
 
02:37:11.389 --> 02:37:11.399 align:start position:0%
that I can provide for you we have a
 
02:37:13.550 --> 02:37:13.560 align:start position:0%
complaint program that helps resolve
 
02:37:15.469 --> 02:37:15.479 align:start position:0%
autocap it's called autocap it resolves
 
02:37:17.570 --> 02:37:17.580 align:start position:0%
complaints between consumers and dealers
 
02:37:20.270 --> 02:37:20.280 align:start position:0%
that are in our association the AGS
 
02:37:23.510 --> 02:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
office actually sends about two 200 or
 
02:37:25.790 --> 02:37:25.800 align:start position:0%
so cases a year over to us and we
 
02:37:27.290 --> 02:37:27.300 align:start position:0%
resolve them because they're actually
 
02:37:29.870 --> 02:37:29.880 align:start position:0%
just not staffed to handle it
 
02:37:31.730 --> 02:37:31.740 align:start position:0%
um so we handle it for them so if you
 
02:37:33.290 --> 02:37:33.300 align:start position:0%
have a constituent concern this is a
 
02:37:35.950 --> 02:37:35.960 align:start position:0%
great program uh to get them some Aid
 
02:37:38.210 --> 02:37:38.220 align:start position:0%
typically it's just a miscommunication
 
02:37:41.929 --> 02:37:41.939 align:start position:0%
issue a Salesman misstated something
 
02:37:43.790 --> 02:37:43.800 align:start position:0%
um and the owner didn't know about it or
 
02:37:45.469 --> 02:37:45.479 align:start position:0%
the customer just didn't really get what
 
02:37:48.650 --> 02:37:48.660 align:start position:0%
tires for life really means so uh
 
02:37:51.650 --> 02:37:51.660 align:start position:0%
communication connection can solve a lot
 
02:37:53.330 --> 02:37:53.340 align:start position:0%
of differences we've found with great
 
02:37:55.910 --> 02:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
success so it'll be a real value to your
 
02:37:58.670 --> 02:37:58.680 align:start position:0%
constituents we also offer an education
 
02:38:00.830 --> 02:38:00.840 align:start position:0%
program we scholarship about a hundred
 
02:38:02.090 --> 02:38:02.100 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars a year to Young
 
02:38:03.889 --> 02:38:03.899 align:start position:0%
technicians that want to move into the
 
02:38:06.250 --> 02:38:06.260 align:start position:0%
automotive industry to work on vehicles
 
02:38:09.290 --> 02:38:09.300 align:start position:0%
technology is emerging at a at a
 
02:38:12.050 --> 02:38:12.060 align:start position:0%
tremendous Pace cost of Education even
 
02:38:13.490 --> 02:38:13.500 align:start position:0%
through the Community College we've got
 
02:38:15.230 --> 02:38:15.240 align:start position:0%

colleges we help get folks through the
 
02:38:20.210 --> 02:38:20.220 align:start position:0%
system pay for classes pay for tools so
 
02:38:21.889 --> 02:38:21.899 align:start position:0%
that they can kind of become the
 
02:38:23.990 --> 02:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
lifeblood of our Workforce we believe in
 
02:38:26.270 --> 02:38:26.280 align:start position:0%
a home-grown Workforce and that's why we
 
02:38:27.410 --> 02:38:27.420 align:start position:0%
support the program through our

02:41:32.460 --> 02:41:33.469 align:start position:0%
it's not what you normally think of a
lobbyist

02:41:33.469 --> 02:41:33.479 align:start position:0%
lobbyist
 
02:41:35.510 --> 02:41:35.520 align:start position:0%

knowledge we do I did finally just get
 
02:41:47.330 --> 02:41:47.340 align:start position:0%
the official list we have 23 bills not
 
02:41:50.030 --> 02:41:50.040 align:start position:0%
too bad last year we had 52 I believe
 
02:41:56.389 --> 02:41:56.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:58.190 --> 02:41:58.200 align:start position:0%
um the other thing we've got a few new
 
02:41:58.200 --> 02:41:59.270 align:start position:0%
um the other thing we've got a few new
members

02:41:59.270 --> 02:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
members
 
02:42:01.429 --> 02:42:01.439 align:start position:0%
um of our new members because we I just
 
02:42:02.870 --> 02:42:02.880 align:start position:0%
wanted to touch briefly on how the
 
02:42:05.030 --> 02:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
public hearings work are you on Town
 
02:42:07.550 --> 02:42:07.560 align:start position:0%
boards or been in the meeting setting
 
02:42:07.560 --> 02:42:09.050 align:start position:0%
boards or been in the meeting setting
before

02:42:09.050 --> 02:42:09.060 align:start position:0%
before
 
02:42:11.389 --> 02:42:11.399 align:start position:0%
and you know it's okay so they all kind
 
02:42:13.130 --> 02:42:13.140 align:start position:0%
of work the same uh the whole the whole
 
02:42:15.170 --> 02:42:15.180 align:start position:0%
idea is that we're here to listen to the
 
02:42:18.110 --> 02:42:18.120 align:start position:0%
public uh seek information ask questions
 
02:42:21.110 --> 02:42:21.120 align:start position:0%
uh we don't get involved with debates uh
 
02:42:23.510 --> 02:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
we don't go back and forth with uh with
 
02:42:26.150 --> 02:42:26.160 align:start position:0%
the with the people testifying uh it's
 
02:42:27.770 --> 02:42:27.780 align:start position:0%
not a time for us to be giving our
 
02:42:30.349 --> 02:42:30.359 align:start position:0%
speeches uh although people like to do
 
02:42:33.889 --> 02:42:33.899 align:start position:0%
lead off comments occasionally
 
02:42:33.899 --> 02:42:34.849 align:start position:0%
lead off comments occasionally
um

02:42:34.849 --> 02:42:34.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:42:36.710 --> 02:42:36.720 align:start position:0%
all questions go through the chair as
 
02:42:37.910 --> 02:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
you can see
 
02:42:39.889 --> 02:42:39.899 align:start position:0%
um and it's just again keeping the
 
02:42:41.510 --> 02:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
structure that we need from the public
 
02:42:43.910 --> 02:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
hearings any questions I'll answer them
 
02:42:46.010 --> 02:42:46.020 align:start position:0%
on the site if you need or I'm a firm
 
02:42:48.170 --> 02:42:48.180 align:start position:0%
believer that the best way to learn is
 
02:42:50.690 --> 02:42:50.700 align:start position:0%
to watch and do and so we'll be doing
 
02:42:53.870 --> 02:42:53.880 align:start position:0%
that this afternoon uh I picked five
 
02:42:53.880 --> 02:42:55.190 align:start position:0%
that this afternoon uh I picked five
bills

02:42:55.190 --> 02:42:55.200 align:start position:0%
bills
 
02:42:57.170 --> 02:42:57.180 align:start position:0%
I gave more time than they probably need
 
02:42:59.150 --> 02:42:59.160 align:start position:0%
I can get pretty aggressive when I do
 
02:43:00.770 --> 02:43:00.780 align:start position:0%
schedule public hearings but I figured
 
02:43:02.570 --> 02:43:02.580 align:start position:0%
today I'd give them more time and I
 
02:43:05.450 --> 02:43:05.460 align:start position:0%
think they need uh just to give us more
 
02:43:07.610 --> 02:43:07.620 align:start position:0%
opportunity to maybe ask and answer
 
02:43:09.710 --> 02:43:09.720 align:start position:0%
questions uh or at least get to know
 
02:43:11.570 --> 02:43:11.580 align:start position:0%
each other so have a good lunch sorry
 
02:43:13.070 --> 02:43:13.080 align:start position:0%
we're a few minutes late
 
02:43:16.070 --> 02:43:16.080 align:start position:0%

Commit This historic committee my first
 
03:34:49.670 --> 03:34:49.680 align:start position:0%
time to uh visit in this capacity
 
03:34:51.950 --> 03:34:51.960 align:start position:0%
so very uh short simple hopefully sweet
 
03:34:54.110 --> 03:34:54.120 align:start position:0%
measure in front of you and there's
 
03:34:57.410 --> 03:34:57.420 align:start position:0%
really two parts two changes to existing
 
03:34:57.420 --> 03:34:58.670 align:start position:0%
really two parts two changes to existing
statute

03:34:58.670 --> 03:34:58.680 align:start position:0%
statute
 
03:35:02.690 --> 03:35:02.700 align:start position:0%
um one of them simply changes uh the the
 
03:35:05.450 --> 03:35:05.460 align:start position:0%
the month that we would be looking for
 
03:35:08.510 --> 03:35:08.520 align:start position:0%
these uh inspections to take place uh
 
03:35:10.610 --> 03:35:10.620 align:start position:0%
from April to May
 
03:35:13.729 --> 03:35:13.739 align:start position:0%
uh in the let me say this I'm originally
 
03:35:16.010 --> 03:35:16.020 align:start position:0%
from coax County
 
03:35:19.010 --> 03:35:19.020 align:start position:0%
um Groveton way up North and where I
 
03:35:22.670 --> 03:35:22.680 align:start position:0%
come from where I came from typically
 
03:35:26.389 --> 03:35:26.399 align:start position:0%
we'd be snowmobiling in early April and
 
03:35:28.429 --> 03:35:28.439 align:start position:0%
um it's a little different down here and
 
03:35:30.170 --> 03:35:30.180 align:start position:0%
I guess you know the climate maybe is
 
03:35:31.670 --> 03:35:31.680 align:start position:0%
what it used to be so as you look around
 
03:35:34.309 --> 03:35:34.319 align:start position:0%
today you don't see the same snow in in
 
03:35:37.010 --> 03:35:37.020 align:start position:0%
salt and sand but again coming from up
 
03:35:37.020 --> 03:35:38.210 align:start position:0%
salt and sand but again coming from up
there

03:35:38.210 --> 03:35:38.220 align:start position:0%
there
 
03:35:39.889 --> 03:35:39.899 align:start position:0%
I'm used to
 
03:35:42.830 --> 03:35:42.840 align:start position:0%
early April being still winter sometimes
 
03:35:44.210 --> 03:35:44.220 align:start position:0%
you never know that means happened down
 
03:35:46.010 --> 03:35:46.020 align:start position:0%
here as well so the thinking being from
 
03:35:48.469 --> 03:35:48.479 align:start position:0%
pushing this back from April to May with
 
03:35:51.650 --> 03:35:51.660 align:start position:0%
older antique vehicles that maybe aren't
 
03:35:54.590 --> 03:35:54.600 align:start position:0%
rust proof you know the way that other
 
03:35:57.349 --> 03:35:57.359 align:start position:0%
vehicles are uh it just might be a
 
03:35:59.090 --> 03:35:59.100 align:start position:0%
little easier on some cars and some
 
03:36:00.889 --> 03:36:00.899 align:start position:0%
venues for certain reasons to push it
 
03:36:02.269 --> 03:36:02.279 align:start position:0%
from April to May so there's there's
 
03:36:02.279 --> 03:36:03.229 align:start position:0%
from April to May so there's there's
that

03:36:03.229 --> 03:36:03.239 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:36:05.929 --> 03:36:05.939 align:start position:0%
and then the second part the other part
 
03:36:10.010 --> 03:36:10.020 align:start position:0%
of the change that we're looking at here
 
03:36:12.469 --> 03:36:12.479 align:start position:0%
um has to do with the the need to
 
03:36:14.630 --> 03:36:14.640 align:start position:0%
re-inspect a vehicle that just hasn't
 
03:36:18.349 --> 03:36:18.359 align:start position:0%
been used much uh most antique older
 
03:36:19.790 --> 03:36:19.800 align:start position:0%
type vehicles
 
03:36:22.610 --> 03:36:22.620 align:start position:0%
are you see them in Memorial Day parades
 
03:36:25.130 --> 03:36:25.140 align:start position:0%
or whatever but they typically
 
03:36:28.250 --> 03:36:28.260 align:start position:0%
often just don't get you they're not
 
03:36:29.510 --> 03:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
driven that much
 
03:36:31.610 --> 03:36:31.620 align:start position:0%
so we put in
 
03:36:34.610 --> 03:36:34.620 align:start position:0%
um the metric of 5 000 miles in the
 
03:36:38.150 --> 03:36:38.160 align:start position:0%
preceding two years and so we think that
 
03:36:40.729 --> 03:36:40.739 align:start position:0%
makes a little bit more sense so this
 
03:36:43.429 --> 03:36:43.439 align:start position:0%
bill will now be the property of this
 
03:36:46.670 --> 03:36:46.680 align:start position:0%
committee and if uh of course those
 
03:36:48.950 --> 03:36:48.960 align:start position:0%
numbers you can change it as you will
 
03:36:51.950 --> 03:36:51.960 align:start position:0%
but that's it that's the two pieces of
 
03:36:54.349 --> 03:36:54.359 align:start position:0%
uh the statute that we like to update
 
03:36:57.010 --> 03:36:57.020 align:start position:0%
and hopefully improve
 
03:36:59.630 --> 03:36:59.640 align:start position:0%
thank you very much any questions from
 
03:37:00.830 --> 03:37:00.840 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
03:37:02.750 --> 03:37:02.760 align:start position:0%
representative O'Hara
 
03:37:04.190 --> 03:37:04.200 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
03:37:05.870 --> 03:37:05.880 align:start position:0%
question um how did you come up with the
 
03:37:09.290 --> 03:37:09.300 align:start position:0%
5 000 miles just inquiring sure uh
 
03:37:11.630 --> 03:37:11.640 align:start position:0%
actually I was speaking to a constituent
 
03:37:14.090 --> 03:37:14.100 align:start position:0%
who uh is actually here and will
 
03:37:16.610 --> 03:37:16.620 align:start position:0%
probably uh have some words to say uh
 
03:37:20.150 --> 03:37:20.160 align:start position:0%
who has several uh antique or or uh
 
03:37:21.590 --> 03:37:21.600 align:start position:0%
older vehicles
 
03:37:25.309 --> 03:37:25.319 align:start position:0%
and so that that metric that 5 000 mile
 
03:37:27.950 --> 03:37:27.960 align:start position:0%
uh figure reflects conversations I've
 
03:37:30.410 --> 03:37:30.420 align:start position:0%
had uh with him and others and like I
 
03:37:32.330 --> 03:37:32.340 align:start position:0%
said that uh obviously is something that
 
03:37:34.190 --> 03:37:34.200 align:start position:0%
you could change uh one way you know
 
03:37:36.290 --> 03:37:36.300 align:start position:0%
could make it greater or less depending
 
03:37:38.450 --> 03:37:38.460 align:start position:0%
upon you know the sentiment of the
 
03:37:38.460 --> 03:37:42.790 align:start position:0%
upon you know the sentiment of the
committee

03:37:42.790 --> 03:37:42.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:46.910 --> 03:37:46.920 align:start position:0%
Representatives Sinclair thank you
 
03:37:49.070 --> 03:37:49.080 align:start position:0%
um you forgive my ignorance on this but
 
03:37:51.769 --> 03:37:51.779 align:start position:0%
an antique vehicle only becomes an
 
03:37:53.870 --> 03:37:53.880 align:start position:0%
antique vehicle with a designated
 
03:37:57.110 --> 03:37:57.120 align:start position:0%
antique plate or is it after it's 25
 
03:37:58.910 --> 03:37:58.920 align:start position:0%
years old
 
03:38:00.170 --> 03:38:00.180 align:start position:0%
thank you representative that's a great
 
03:38:02.809 --> 03:38:02.819 align:start position:0%
question and to make sure you get the
 
03:38:06.110 --> 03:38:06.120 align:start position:0%
best answer I'm going to uh defer to the
 
03:38:08.750 --> 03:38:08.760 align:start position:0%
next uh person to testify who actually
 
03:38:11.389 --> 03:38:11.399 align:start position:0%
has antique vehicles and in several
 
03:38:13.370 --> 03:38:13.380 align:start position:0%
different states and I'm sure he'd be
 
03:38:17.630 --> 03:38:17.640 align:start position:0%
happy to speak to the to the how antique
 
03:38:19.490 --> 03:38:19.500 align:start position:0%
Vehicles Define it's a great question
 
03:38:21.050 --> 03:38:21.060 align:start position:0%
that that I'd like to understand a
 
03:38:23.690 --> 03:38:23.700 align:start position:0%
little bit better myself because uh you
 
03:38:25.250 --> 03:38:25.260 align:start position:0%
know I may have an antique vehicle
 
03:38:27.469 --> 03:38:27.479 align:start position:0%
myself someday and I want to know what
 
03:38:30.349 --> 03:38:30.359 align:start position:0%
it takes to be an antique so that's not
 
03:38:32.150 --> 03:38:32.160 align:start position:0%
a great answer but that information is
 
03:38:34.010 --> 03:38:34.020 align:start position:0%
coming at you in just a couple minutes
 
03:38:36.769 --> 03:38:36.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:38.330 --> 03:38:38.340 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
03:38:42.769 --> 03:38:42.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:45.830 --> 03:38:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:47.929 --> 03:38:47.939 align:start position:0%
um representative Moffett
 
03:38:50.990 --> 03:38:51.000 align:start position:0%
how do you envision the
 
03:38:53.389 --> 03:38:53.399 align:start position:0%
confirmation of the five thousand miles
 
03:38:56.990 --> 03:38:57.000 align:start position:0%
who would be responsible to do that
 
03:39:00.610 --> 03:39:00.620 align:start position:0%
sure when a vehicle is inspected uh
 
03:39:02.990 --> 03:39:03.000 align:start position:0%
typically is you know registered or
 
03:39:05.510 --> 03:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
inspected there's a note made of the
 
03:39:07.610 --> 03:39:07.620 align:start position:0%
mileage from the odometer
 
03:39:07.620 --> 03:39:08.870 align:start position:0%
mileage from the odometer
so

03:39:08.870 --> 03:39:08.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:39:12.110 --> 03:39:12.120 align:start position:0%
that information would be documented in
 
03:39:14.630 --> 03:39:14.640 align:start position:0%
the paperwork that would go uh you know
 
03:39:16.790 --> 03:39:16.800 align:start position:0%
the inspecting agency whatever would
 
03:39:20.389 --> 03:39:20.399 align:start position:0%
make that that notation and again
 
03:39:24.110 --> 03:39:24.120 align:start position:0%
um I the following speaker who's been
 
03:39:25.550 --> 03:39:25.560 align:start position:0%
through this process many times could
 
03:39:27.290 --> 03:39:27.300 align:start position:0%
also speak to that probably a little bit
 
03:39:32.150 --> 03:39:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:35.210 --> 03:39:35.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:37.070 --> 03:39:37.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
03:39:39.889 --> 03:39:39.899 align:start position:0%
um I was just curious if uh the
 
03:39:41.630 --> 03:39:41.640 align:start position:0%
inspection requirements were different
 
03:39:44.690 --> 03:39:44.700 align:start position:0%
for antique Vehicles as compared to
 
03:39:48.110 --> 03:39:48.120 align:start position:0%
regular Vehicles newer ones
 
03:39:49.849 --> 03:39:49.859 align:start position:0%
thank you guys have another excellent
 
03:39:53.090 --> 03:39:53.100 align:start position:0%
question and uh
 
03:39:55.550 --> 03:39:55.560 align:start position:0%
for the third time I am gonna in all
 
03:39:57.469 --> 03:39:57.479 align:start position:0%
Candor in all honesty I'm gonna defer to
 
03:39:59.269 --> 03:39:59.279 align:start position:0%
someone who's who's been in that world
 
03:40:01.190 --> 03:40:01.200 align:start position:0%
for a long time and uh that's an
 
03:40:03.710 --> 03:40:03.720 align:start position:0%
excellent question and uh
 
03:40:05.750 --> 03:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
I will find that answer if you don't get
 
03:40:07.250 --> 03:40:07.260 align:start position:0%
it in the next five or ten minutes I
 
03:40:08.330 --> 03:40:08.340 align:start position:0%
will find that answer for you
 
03:40:08.340 --> 03:40:12.170 align:start position:0%
will find that answer for you
representative

03:40:12.170 --> 03:40:12.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:12.180 --> 03:40:14.450 align:start position:0%
 
representative

03:40:14.450 --> 03:40:14.460 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:40:15.710 --> 03:40:15.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
03:40:16.790 --> 03:40:16.800 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
03:40:18.950 --> 03:40:18.960 align:start position:0%
um how many times can you use the 5 000
 
03:40:23.050 --> 03:40:23.060 align:start position:0%
mile exemption is is it limited to one
 
03:40:25.190 --> 03:40:25.200 align:start position:0%
inspection cycle or can you just keep
 
03:40:26.210 --> 03:40:26.220 align:start position:0%
carrying it forward if you haven't
 
03:40:28.429 --> 03:40:28.439 align:start position:0%
driven it more than 5 000 miles in 10
 
03:40:29.809 --> 03:40:29.819 align:start position:0%
years or you're not required to go in
 
03:40:31.429 --> 03:40:31.439 align:start position:0%
for an inspection
 
03:40:33.110 --> 03:40:33.120 align:start position:0%
thank you representative that is another
 
03:40:35.210 --> 03:40:35.220 align:start position:0%
excellent question and so the the wheels
 
03:40:37.010 --> 03:40:37.020 align:start position:0%
are turning here
 
03:40:39.229 --> 03:40:39.239 align:start position:0%
um that raises an excellent question
 
03:40:41.269 --> 03:40:41.279 align:start position:0%
that I don't know if that needs to be in
 
03:40:43.910 --> 03:40:43.920 align:start position:0%
statute or perhaps it should be uh in
 
03:40:48.110 --> 03:40:48.120 align:start position:0%
terms of you know uh how often would
 
03:40:49.729 --> 03:40:49.739 align:start position:0%
would this uh
 
03:40:53.450 --> 03:40:53.460 align:start position:0%
you know this 5 000 mile rule apply
 
03:40:55.729 --> 03:40:55.739 align:start position:0%
um I will we'll get you an answer uh
 
03:40:56.990 --> 03:40:57.000 align:start position:0%
today on that
 
03:41:00.110 --> 03:41:00.120 align:start position:0%
um and again as I said before uh now
 
03:41:02.750 --> 03:41:02.760 align:start position:0%
that this committee owns this measure uh
 
03:41:04.910 --> 03:41:04.920 align:start position:0%
when you think it's been some excellent
 
03:41:06.349 --> 03:41:06.359 align:start position:0%
questions and there will probably be
 
03:41:09.070 --> 03:41:09.080 align:start position:0%
more as you look at this and discuss it
 
03:41:12.410 --> 03:41:12.420 align:start position:0%
in this hearing and Beyond so if you
 
03:41:14.750 --> 03:41:14.760 align:start position:0%
flag you know questions like that again
 
03:41:15.889 --> 03:41:15.899 align:start position:0%
it's something that the committee
 
03:41:18.170 --> 03:41:18.180 align:start position:0%
certainly could add to the language and
 
03:41:18.180 --> 03:41:19.070 align:start position:0%
certainly could add to the language and
uh

03:41:19.070 --> 03:41:19.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:41:24.530 --> 03:41:24.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:26.269 --> 03:41:26.279 align:start position:0%
representative I actually have a
 
03:41:29.630 --> 03:41:29.640 align:start position:0%
question regarding antique Vehicles do
 
03:41:31.910 --> 03:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
all of them have odometers
 
03:41:34.910 --> 03:41:34.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question I
 
03:41:37.969 --> 03:41:37.979 align:start position:0%
I am sure that the real antiques that go
 
03:41:40.429 --> 03:41:40.439 align:start position:0%
way back uh before odometers were
 
03:41:44.530 --> 03:41:44.540 align:start position:0%
invented did not have odometers and that
 
03:41:48.410 --> 03:41:48.420 align:start position:0%
as to when odometers came into being a
 
03:41:50.750 --> 03:41:50.760 align:start position:0%
I'm going to guess some of the duty
 
03:41:52.370 --> 03:41:52.380 align:start position:0%
experts in this committee maybe know
 
03:41:52.380 --> 03:41:53.530 align:start position:0%
experts in this committee maybe know
that

03:41:53.530 --> 03:41:53.540 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:41:56.269 --> 03:41:56.279 align:start position:0%
but again that's a that's a great
 
03:41:59.090 --> 03:41:59.100 align:start position:0%
question we'll get that answer and the
 
03:42:00.950 --> 03:42:00.960 align:start position:0%
gentleman to follow me may have that and
 
03:42:02.870 --> 03:42:02.880 align:start position:0%
like I said if he doesn't have that we
 
03:42:04.790 --> 03:42:04.800 align:start position:0%
will find that out today
 
03:42:07.250 --> 03:42:07.260 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions from the
 
03:42:07.260 --> 03:42:09.170 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions from the
committee

03:42:09.170 --> 03:42:09.180 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:42:11.090 --> 03:42:11.100 align:start position:0%
representative sellers
 
03:42:13.250 --> 03:42:13.260 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair do you know how many
 
03:42:16.729 --> 03:42:16.739 align:start position:0%
antique Vehicles New Hampshire has
 
03:42:20.389 --> 03:42:20.399 align:start position:0%
uh another great question and my batting
 
03:42:21.950 --> 03:42:21.960 align:start position:0%
average on answering these questions is
 
03:42:24.110 --> 03:42:24.120 align:start position:0%
not great and I no I don't know how many
 
03:42:26.450 --> 03:42:26.460 align:start position:0%
there are but uh I I am curious and
 
03:42:28.190 --> 03:42:28.200 align:start position:0%
these are things that we will find out
 
03:42:34.490 --> 03:42:34.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:39.769 --> 03:42:39.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:39.779 --> 03:42:44.030 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:42:44.030 --> 03:42:44.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:45.830 --> 03:42:45.840 align:start position:0%
antique Vehicles do they have their own
 
03:42:47.389 --> 03:42:47.399 align:start position:0%
emission standards that aren't the same
 
03:42:49.610 --> 03:42:49.620 align:start position:0%
as temporary vehicles
 
03:42:50.929 --> 03:42:50.939 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question that's an
 
03:42:52.370 --> 03:42:52.380 align:start position:0%
interesting question I actually was
 
03:42:54.229 --> 03:42:54.239 align:start position:0%
speaking to uh the gentleman is going to
 
03:42:56.030 --> 03:42:56.040 align:start position:0%
follow me here uh who actually
 
03:42:58.250 --> 03:42:58.260 align:start position:0%
originally from Connecticut and I spent
 
03:43:00.530 --> 03:43:00.540 align:start position:0%
a lot of time in California so the
 
03:43:01.849 --> 03:43:01.859 align:start position:0%
question with regard to Mission
 
03:43:04.450 --> 03:43:04.460 align:start position:0%
standards varies from state to state
 
03:43:08.990 --> 03:43:09.000 align:start position:0%
in terms of uh New Hampshire again I'm
 
03:43:11.050 --> 03:43:11.060 align:start position:0%
not sure what the latest is but
 
03:43:13.610 --> 03:43:13.620 align:start position:0%
that does raise another question in
 
03:43:16.690 --> 03:43:16.700 align:start position:0%
terms of the state like if someone
 
03:43:19.729 --> 03:43:19.739 align:start position:0%
moves to New Hampshire which uh the
 
03:43:21.170 --> 03:43:21.180 align:start position:0%
gentleman to follow me moved here from
 
03:43:21.180 --> 03:43:22.389 align:start position:0%
gentleman to follow me moved here from
Connecticut

03:43:22.389 --> 03:43:22.399 align:start position:0%
Connecticut
 
03:43:24.650 --> 03:43:24.660 align:start position:0%
with in fact you know we're just talking
 
03:43:25.849 --> 03:43:25.859 align:start position:0%
about this
 
03:43:29.630 --> 03:43:29.640 align:start position:0%
a vehicle that passes an emission uh
 
03:43:33.769 --> 03:43:33.779 align:start position:0%
requirement in one state uh may have to
 
03:43:35.870 --> 03:43:35.880 align:start position:0%
change you know what passes in one state
 
03:43:38.090 --> 03:43:38.100 align:start position:0%
may not pass in another state so uh
 
03:43:42.469 --> 03:43:42.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:45.530 --> 03:43:45.540 align:start position:0%
any further questions from the committee
 
03:43:48.229 --> 03:43:48.239 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you representative
 
03:43:52.090 --> 03:43:52.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:55.550 --> 03:43:55.560 align:start position:0%
recognizes uh Paul Messier who's in
 
03:44:00.309 --> 03:44:00.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:05.030 --> 03:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:05.040 --> 03:44:07.130 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:44:07.130 --> 03:44:07.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:44:09.410 --> 03:44:09.420 align:start position:0%
yes I'm I'm the gentleman uh Mike was
 
03:44:12.590 --> 03:44:12.600 align:start position:0%
talking about uh I just I moved I moved
 
03:44:14.690 --> 03:44:14.700 align:start position:0%
into new New Hampshire
 
03:44:17.750 --> 03:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
um a few years years ago
 
03:44:17.760 --> 03:44:19.010 align:start position:0%
um a few years years ago
um

03:44:19.010 --> 03:44:19.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:44:22.190 --> 03:44:22.200 align:start position:0%
and um one of the things I've I've
 
03:44:24.229 --> 03:44:24.239 align:start position:0%
experienced with not only trouble
 
03:44:26.389 --> 03:44:26.399 align:start position:0%
getting the car prop properly in
 
03:44:28.250 --> 03:44:28.260 align:start position:0%
inspected but
 
03:44:29.990 --> 03:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
um I don't like running my cars when
 
03:44:32.690 --> 03:44:32.700 align:start position:0%
there's sand and salt on on the road I
 
03:44:35.929 --> 03:44:35.939 align:start position:0%
volunteer uh at the at the at New
 
03:44:38.090 --> 03:44:38.100 align:start position:0%
England at noon at the New England at
 
03:44:40.729 --> 03:44:40.739 align:start position:0%
the New England racing racing Museum up
 
03:44:43.309 --> 03:44:43.319 align:start position:0%
by this up by in Loudon by the by the by
 
03:44:46.550 --> 03:44:46.560 align:start position:0%
the track and I have worked at a lot of
 
03:44:49.490 --> 03:44:49.500 align:start position:0%
car shows gotten gotten involved with a
 
03:44:51.950 --> 03:44:51.960 align:start position:0%
lot of car people in the state one of
 
03:44:54.170 --> 03:44:54.180 align:start position:0%
the questions was how many antique cars
 
03:44:56.450 --> 03:44:56.460 align:start position:0%
we have in the state I really don't
 
03:44:59.090 --> 03:44:59.100 align:start position:0%
quantify that however
 
03:45:01.370 --> 03:45:01.380 align:start position:0%
I can honestly say since I've been in
 
03:45:04.070 --> 03:45:04.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I I have learned of three
 
03:45:06.590 --> 03:45:06.600 align:start position:0%
car collections that have excess of 100
 
03:45:06.600 --> 03:45:08.210 align:start position:0%
car collections that have excess of 100
cars

03:45:08.210 --> 03:45:08.220 align:start position:0%
cars
 
03:45:08.220 --> 03:45:09.530 align:start position:0%
cars
yeah

03:45:09.530 --> 03:45:09.540 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:45:13.250 --> 03:45:13.260 align:start position:0%
um and um the one of the ones in Sanborn
 
03:45:14.690 --> 03:45:14.700 align:start position:0%
to Borton
 
03:45:19.849 --> 03:45:19.859 align:start position:0%
he's got a 1926 Rolls-Royce Phantom
 
03:45:23.150 --> 03:45:23.160 align:start position:0%
um yes it does have a an odometer on it
 
03:45:25.849 --> 03:45:25.859 align:start position:0%
uh but he actually this guy is very is
 
03:45:28.250 --> 03:45:28.260 align:start position:0%
very very very wealthy and he's got his
 
03:45:31.370 --> 03:45:31.380 align:start position:0%
own private private his only private
 
03:45:34.610 --> 03:45:34.620 align:start position:0%
mechanic that is certified by state to
 
03:45:36.650 --> 03:45:36.660 align:start position:0%
throw put the inspection sticker on the
 
03:45:38.690 --> 03:45:38.700 align:start position:0%
on the car
 
03:45:40.670 --> 03:45:40.680 align:start position:0%
um because you know he says it's it's
 
03:45:42.950 --> 03:45:42.960 align:start position:0%
impossible to find someone that's first
 
03:45:45.590 --> 03:45:45.600 align:start position:0%
aversal enough that knows what to look
 
03:45:49.729 --> 03:45:49.739 align:start position:0%
for you know old old old cars
 
03:45:51.769 --> 03:45:51.779 align:start position:0%
uh so you know my first part of this
 
03:45:54.050 --> 03:45:54.060 align:start position:0%
bill was to move the inspection from
 
03:45:56.090 --> 03:45:56.100 align:start position:0%
April to may just so we're not forced to
 
03:45:58.210 --> 03:45:58.220 align:start position:0%
take the cars out on the sand and salt
 
03:46:01.990 --> 03:46:02.000 align:start position:0%
uh I brought mine in May of last year
 
03:46:05.150 --> 03:46:05.160 align:start position:0%
the garage had a line after me of all
 
03:46:07.190 --> 03:46:07.200 align:start position:0%
antique cars and this was during the
 
03:46:11.090 --> 03:46:11.100 align:start position:0%
month of May so we were already expired
 
03:46:14.630 --> 03:46:14.640 align:start position:0%
uh the second part of the bill the 5 000
 
03:46:14.640 --> 03:46:16.309 align:start position:0%
uh the second part of the bill the 5 000
mile

03:46:16.309 --> 03:46:16.319 align:start position:0%
mile
 
03:46:16.319 --> 03:46:17.990 align:start position:0%
mile
um

03:46:17.990 --> 03:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:46:18.000 --> 03:46:19.130 align:start position:0%
um
actually

03:46:19.130 --> 03:46:19.140 align:start position:0%
actually
 
03:46:21.469 --> 03:46:21.479 align:start position:0%
um the way I envisioned that working is
 
03:46:23.150 --> 03:46:23.160 align:start position:0%
the mileage when they put a sticker on
 
03:46:25.250 --> 03:46:25.260 align:start position:0%
the windshield of that's past their
 
03:46:28.309 --> 03:46:28.319 align:start position:0%
mileage is on the sticker so if a and
 
03:46:31.429 --> 03:46:31.439 align:start position:0%
this is the this would be the only onus
 
03:46:33.050 --> 03:46:33.060 align:start position:0%
on let's say a
 
03:46:34.670 --> 03:46:34.680 align:start position:0%
you're gonna end up driving that car
 
03:46:38.030 --> 03:46:38.040 align:start position:0%
right now it goes by the by the color
 
03:46:39.889 --> 03:46:39.899 align:start position:0%
you get flagged by the color if I think
 
03:46:41.870 --> 03:46:41.880 align:start position:0%
the police look for the colors thicker
 
03:46:43.849 --> 03:46:43.859 align:start position:0%
is going to make their job one more step
 
03:46:45.110 --> 03:46:45.120 align:start position:0%
they're going to say well gee that
 
03:46:47.090 --> 03:46:47.100 align:start position:0%
color's expired he stops looks at the
 
03:46:49.670 --> 03:46:49.680 align:start position:0%
car uh looks at the tag on the
 
03:46:52.190 --> 03:46:52.200 align:start position:0%
windshield looks at the miles let's say
 
03:46:54.830 --> 03:46:54.840 align:start position:0%
50 000 and you only get 51 000 on the
 
03:46:57.290 --> 03:46:57.300 align:start position:0%
odometer he's got to ask the as a driver
 
03:46:59.510 --> 03:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
that's the only
 
03:47:01.910 --> 03:47:01.920 align:start position:0%
issue I see with the with the mileage my
 
03:47:04.610 --> 03:47:04.620 align:start position:0%
my I'm I feel I'm being conservative on
 
03:47:07.969 --> 03:47:07.979 align:start position:0%
the 5 000 Miles because
 
03:47:07.979 --> 03:47:08.809 align:start position:0%
the 5 000 Miles because
um

03:47:08.809 --> 03:47:08.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:47:14.510 --> 03:47:14.520 align:start position:0%
the you know a car is the parts that
 
03:47:16.070 --> 03:47:16.080 align:start position:0%
gonna need an inspection to make sure
 
03:47:17.450 --> 03:47:17.460 align:start position:0%
they were they're still mechanically
 
03:47:19.910 --> 03:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
sound where during during the course of
 
03:47:21.530 --> 03:47:21.540 align:start position:0%
driving driving a car
 
03:47:23.630 --> 03:47:23.640 align:start position:0%
these antique cars are typically only
 
03:47:25.910 --> 03:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
driven the summer months a few a few
 
03:47:28.429 --> 03:47:28.439 align:start position:0%
hundred hundred miles up at the most
 
03:47:31.910 --> 03:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
probably so it would take and I'm once
 
03:47:34.070 --> 03:47:34.080 align:start position:0%
you go over that 5 000 mile threshold
 
03:47:37.010 --> 03:47:37.020 align:start position:0%
the car would have to be that car would
 
03:47:39.910 --> 03:47:39.920 align:start position:0%
have to be in
 
03:47:42.469 --> 03:47:42.479 align:start position:0%
inspected so basically you kind of
 
03:47:44.750 --> 03:47:44.760 align:start position:0%
expand the time limit from a time limit
 
03:47:49.190 --> 03:47:49.200 align:start position:0%
to a to a mileage limit uh with that
 
03:47:52.010 --> 03:47:52.020 align:start position:0%
with that with that part part of the law
 
03:47:53.690 --> 03:47:53.700 align:start position:0%
and um
 
03:47:55.370 --> 03:47:55.380 align:start position:0%
so you know that's all I'm trying to do
 
03:47:57.290 --> 03:47:57.300 align:start position:0%
there is trying to give all these you
 
03:47:59.330 --> 03:47:59.340 align:start position:0%
know people with classic cars hey
 
03:48:01.729 --> 03:48:01.739 align:start position:0%
instead of going every two every two
 
03:48:05.030 --> 03:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
years right now uh antique car is any
 
03:48:07.729 --> 03:48:07.739 align:start position:0%
car that's over over 25
 
03:48:11.750 --> 03:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
any car over 25 years old the two-year
 
03:48:15.950 --> 03:48:15.960 align:start position:0%
inspection is a car over 40 40 years so
 
03:48:18.530 --> 03:48:18.540 align:start position:0%
between 25 and 40 you have to have it
 
03:48:20.929 --> 03:48:20.939 align:start position:0%
inspected every every year by the way I
 
03:48:24.229 --> 03:48:24.239 align:start position:0%
understand what the law is
 
03:48:27.590 --> 03:48:27.600 align:start position:0%
um emissions expires at after 20 after
 
03:48:31.190 --> 03:48:31.200 align:start position:0%
20 20 years and that's been most of the
 
03:48:33.830 --> 03:48:33.840 align:start position:0%
states that I've looked at uh emissions
 
03:48:36.650 --> 03:48:36.660 align:start position:0%
are only checked at at the in the for
 
03:48:41.450 --> 03:48:41.460 align:start position:0%
the first 20 years of the of the car age
 
03:48:43.130 --> 03:48:43.140 align:start position:0%
um I think I hit on most of the
 
03:48:46.010 --> 03:48:46.020 align:start position:0%
questions you're asking Mike Mike there
 
03:48:46.020 --> 03:48:47.030 align:start position:0%
questions you're asking Mike Mike there
um

03:48:47.030 --> 03:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:48:50.809 --> 03:48:50.819 align:start position:0%
my further point on the 5 000 mile limit
 
03:48:53.990 --> 03:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
uh and talking some some people that um
 
03:48:56.870 --> 03:48:56.880 align:start position:0%
uh Mike didn't put in this bill but I'd
 
03:48:59.389 --> 03:48:59.399 align:start position:0%
like to like to like like the committee
 
03:49:00.710 --> 03:49:00.720 align:start position:0%
to think about
 
03:49:03.290 --> 03:49:03.300 align:start position:0%
uh I have have run into a lot of people
 
03:49:06.050 --> 03:49:06.060 align:start position:0%
that now work from home they put very
 
03:49:08.030 --> 03:49:08.040 align:start position:0%
few miles on their on their personal car
 
03:49:12.710 --> 03:49:12.720 align:start position:0%
and even me myself I have a 2004 van
 
03:49:15.410 --> 03:49:15.420 align:start position:0%
that I don't use very very often when I
 
03:49:17.570 --> 03:49:17.580 align:start position:0%
brought it in for inspection last year
 
03:49:20.210 --> 03:49:20.220 align:start position:0%
the guy goes you've only put 3 000 miles
 
03:49:21.530 --> 03:49:21.540 align:start position:0%
on the car
 
03:49:24.290 --> 03:49:24.300 align:start position:0%
and it's like yeah I have seven vehicles
 
03:49:26.809 --> 03:49:26.819 align:start position:0%
I can drive in the summertime I'd like
 
03:49:29.450 --> 03:49:29.460 align:start position:0%
to take out the out of my 66 Mustang I
 
03:49:33.290 --> 03:49:33.300 align:start position:0%
don't like to pick out my 2004 van and
 
03:49:34.910 --> 03:49:34.920 align:start position:0%
uh he just thought it was a complete
 
03:49:36.889 --> 03:49:36.899 align:start position:0%
waste of time to even even inspect it
 
03:49:39.889 --> 03:49:39.899 align:start position:0%
that was his his exact words and I
 
03:49:41.690 --> 03:49:41.700 align:start position:0%
basically felt like I paid forty dollars
 
03:49:43.309 --> 03:49:43.319 align:start position:0%
for a sticker on the windshield and it
 
03:49:45.050 --> 03:49:45.060 align:start position:0%
really didn't didn't look at it at any
 
03:49:47.690 --> 03:49:47.700 align:start position:0%
anything but he had he had looked at it
 
03:49:52.729 --> 03:49:52.739 align:start position:0%
over good a year year be before so this
 
03:49:54.590 --> 03:49:54.600 align:start position:0%
mileage limit I'd like to
 
03:49:56.690 --> 03:49:56.700 align:start position:0%
like the board to you know the the
 
03:49:59.630 --> 03:49:59.640 align:start position:0%
consider maybe extend to all the other
 
03:50:01.130 --> 03:50:01.140 align:start position:0%
people that work from home and that kind
 
03:50:04.309 --> 03:50:04.319 align:start position:0%
of and retired people is they don't put
 
03:50:09.050 --> 03:50:09.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:11.809 --> 03:50:11.819 align:start position:0%
um I think I hit most of my points my
 
03:50:15.170 --> 03:50:15.180 align:start position:0%
notes any questions for me
 
03:50:16.250 --> 03:50:16.260 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
 
03:50:16.260 --> 03:50:17.150 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
committee

03:50:17.150 --> 03:50:17.160 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:50:19.130 --> 03:50:19.140 align:start position:0%
representative Staub
 
03:50:22.370 --> 03:50:22.380 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman is it possible for
 
03:50:24.950 --> 03:50:24.960 align:start position:0%
an antique vehicle to fail for reasons
 
03:50:26.929 --> 03:50:26.939 align:start position:0%
that are independent of how many miles
 
03:50:28.790 --> 03:50:28.800 align:start position:0%
are on the car
 
03:50:31.729 --> 03:50:31.739 align:start position:0%
yes it is I mean especially if a car is
 
03:50:34.150 --> 03:50:34.160 align:start position:0%
driven a lot in the winter time in in
 
03:50:37.010 --> 03:50:37.020 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
03:50:38.269 --> 03:50:38.279 align:start position:0%
um you know use
 
03:50:41.590 --> 03:50:41.600 align:start position:0%
um use salt to salt on the roads and um
 
03:50:45.410 --> 03:50:45.420 align:start position:0%
and I'm gonna say new
 
03:50:48.170 --> 03:50:48.180 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is I'm going to say
 
03:50:50.090 --> 03:50:50.100 align:start position:0%
um by what I've read not that I've seen
 
03:50:52.790 --> 03:50:52.800 align:start position:0%
it enforced basically is looking for any
 
03:50:55.969 --> 03:50:55.979 align:start position:0%
rust on the vehicle and by what I've
 
03:50:58.790 --> 03:50:58.800 align:start position:0%
read any you're not supposed to have any
 
03:51:01.370 --> 03:51:01.380 align:start position:0%
rust holes in outer body or the frame
 
03:51:01.380 --> 03:51:03.830 align:start position:0%
rust holes in outer body or the frame
however

03:51:03.830 --> 03:51:03.840 align:start position:0%
however
 
03:51:06.250 --> 03:51:06.260 align:start position:0%
um I still see a lot of cars on the road
 
03:51:10.370 --> 03:51:10.380 align:start position:0%
uh with either holes or what's about to
 
03:51:12.710 --> 03:51:12.720 align:start position:0%
come whole so depending on on the
 
03:51:14.750 --> 03:51:14.760 align:start position:0%
maintenance of vehicle vehicle you could
 
03:51:17.269 --> 03:51:17.279 align:start position:0%
have a fairly new vehicle I just talked
 
03:51:18.769 --> 03:51:18.779 align:start position:0%
to someone a week
 
03:51:20.929 --> 03:51:20.939 align:start position:0%
uh I don't know how many miles we're on
 
03:51:23.210 --> 03:51:23.220 align:start position:0%
this car but I just talked to someone at
 
03:51:26.090 --> 03:51:26.100 align:start position:0%
the Museum last weekend that had a 2014
 
03:51:29.750 --> 03:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
Chevy that just failed because of of the
 
03:51:32.809 --> 03:51:32.819 align:start position:0%
of the rust and uh so it's very possible
 
03:51:35.510 --> 03:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
but here again so yeah you could have an
 
03:51:38.090 --> 03:51:38.100 align:start position:0%
everyday driver that could fail on on
 
03:51:39.830 --> 03:51:39.840 align:start position:0%
salt but
 
03:51:42.530 --> 03:51:42.540 align:start position:0%
and this is this brings up a point of
 
03:51:44.750 --> 03:51:44.760 align:start position:0%
what's going on with the inspections
 
03:51:46.969 --> 03:51:46.979 align:start position:0%
also from my experience and my personal
 
03:51:48.530 --> 03:51:48.540 align:start position:0%
experience on looking at a couple of
 
03:51:48.540 --> 03:51:50.030 align:start position:0%
experience on looking at a couple of
vehicles

03:51:50.030 --> 03:51:50.040 align:start position:0%
vehicles
 
03:51:53.630 --> 03:51:53.640 align:start position:0%
I've seen Vehicles get passed along
 
03:51:56.330 --> 03:51:56.340 align:start position:0%
and all sudden and actually sold that
 
03:51:59.870 --> 03:51:59.880 align:start position:0%
small used car dealer dealer dealerships
 
03:52:02.210 --> 03:52:02.220 align:start position:0%
and then the buyer a year later finds
 
03:52:04.010 --> 03:52:04.020 align:start position:0%
out it failed because there's a big hole
 
03:52:06.110 --> 03:52:06.120 align:start position:0%
in the frame that the other dealership
 
03:52:09.349 --> 03:52:09.359 align:start position:0%
through a pass sticker on you know on
 
03:52:11.150 --> 03:52:11.160 align:start position:0%
unfortunately there's always a few bad
 
03:52:13.969 --> 03:52:13.979 align:start position:0%
apples but put it that way and in this
 
03:52:16.190 --> 03:52:16.200 align:start position:0%
case there was a you know um and I have
 
03:52:17.389 --> 03:52:17.399 align:start position:0%
a picture if you'd like to see it there
 
03:52:18.950 --> 03:52:18.960 align:start position:0%
was a big hole in the frame that the
 
03:52:21.469 --> 03:52:21.479 align:start position:0%
dealership had tarred over and sold it
 
03:52:24.050 --> 03:52:24.060 align:start position:0%
and now this this guy paid five thousand
 
03:52:28.070 --> 03:52:28.080 align:start position:0%
dollars for a car that's basically junk
 
03:52:30.889 --> 03:52:30.899 align:start position:0%
um and um so you know this kind of stuff
 
03:52:33.050 --> 03:52:33.060 align:start position:0%
stuff does does happen there's no
 
03:52:36.950 --> 03:52:36.960 align:start position:0%
perfect system out there and to me it
 
03:52:38.450 --> 03:52:38.460 align:start position:0%
should be flagged
 
03:52:40.969 --> 03:52:40.979 align:start position:0%
in the car in either in the Carfax in
 
03:52:42.650 --> 03:52:42.660 align:start position:0%
this particular
 
03:52:45.050 --> 03:52:45.060 align:start position:0%
um vehicle I actually ran the Carfax out
 
03:52:48.050 --> 03:52:48.060 align:start position:0%
of curiosity there's no Flags in the
 
03:52:50.469 --> 03:52:50.479 align:start position:0%
Carfax or the vehicle inspection reports
 
03:52:53.889 --> 03:52:53.899 align:start position:0%
that it had a rust problem
 
03:52:57.830 --> 03:52:57.840 align:start position:0%
Russ that rust that disables a car from
 
03:52:59.510 --> 03:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
being driven on the road does not happen
 
03:53:01.790 --> 03:53:01.800 align:start position:0%
in a year does not happen in two or
 
03:53:04.610 --> 03:53:04.620 align:start position:0%
three years it's it's at least a three
 
03:53:05.929 --> 03:53:05.939 align:start position:0%
to four year thing where it's going to
 
03:53:09.050 --> 03:53:09.060 align:start position:0%
get worse and worse and worse where I
 
03:53:11.389 --> 03:53:11.399 align:start position:0%
feel as the mechanics responsibility to
 
03:53:13.849 --> 03:53:13.859 align:start position:0%
put a notation there should be a flag on
 
03:53:15.790 --> 03:53:15.800 align:start position:0%
that car that there's a problem coming
 
03:53:19.910 --> 03:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
and and there isn't so I can honestly
 
03:53:22.429 --> 03:53:22.439 align:start position:0%
say going from a state of of Connecticut
 
03:53:25.190 --> 03:53:25.200 align:start position:0%
which has no inspections to appear I
 
03:53:28.389 --> 03:53:28.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:31.969 --> 03:53:31.979 align:start position:0%
thank you any further questions
 
03:53:31.979 --> 03:53:34.670 align:start position:0%
thank you any further questions
representative

03:53:34.670 --> 03:53:34.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:36.769 --> 03:53:36.779 align:start position:0%
we've had thank you Mr chairman thank
 
03:53:38.210 --> 03:53:38.220 align:start position:0%
you again for taking my question um
 
03:53:40.429 --> 03:53:40.439 align:start position:0%
we've had testimony in the past that
 
03:53:42.950 --> 03:53:42.960 align:start position:0%
inspections tend to look at where items
 
03:53:44.389 --> 03:53:44.399 align:start position:0%
um and they're not always dependent on
 
03:53:46.010 --> 03:53:46.020 align:start position:0%
mileage it can
 
03:53:48.889 --> 03:53:48.899 align:start position:0%
rubber items like brake lines windshield
 
03:53:51.950 --> 03:53:51.960 align:start position:0%
wipers tires uh rubber seals can all
 
03:53:54.229 --> 03:53:54.239 align:start position:0%
deteriorate over time brake line breaks
 
03:53:56.650 --> 03:53:56.660 align:start position:0%
can seize up over time
 
03:53:59.389 --> 03:53:59.399 align:start position:0%
how do you prevent somebody who's maybe
 
03:54:01.429 --> 03:54:01.439 align:start position:0%
stored their car for two years hasn't
 
03:54:03.889 --> 03:54:03.899 align:start position:0%
driven it a single mile from
 
03:54:06.110 --> 03:54:06.120 align:start position:0%
assuming that the car is just in great
 
03:54:07.309 --> 03:54:07.319 align:start position:0%
condition because I've interpreted into
 
03:54:09.769 --> 03:54:09.779 align:start position:0%
you know two years and I can just take
 
03:54:10.610 --> 03:54:10.620 align:start position:0%
it out on the road because I don't
 
03:54:11.990 --> 03:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
legally need it
 
03:54:13.969 --> 03:54:13.979 align:start position:0%
that's why on the mile you know on the
 
03:54:16.610 --> 03:54:16.620 align:start position:0%
on the mileage limit I kept it kept it
 
03:54:19.010 --> 03:54:19.020 align:start position:0%
fairly low I think 5 000 miles is very
 
03:54:21.050 --> 03:54:21.060 align:start position:0%
very low
 
03:54:23.210 --> 03:54:23.220 align:start position:0%
um you know and as opposed to like a ten
 
03:54:26.809 --> 03:54:26.819 align:start position:0%
a ten Thousand Mile limit but you know
 
03:54:29.450 --> 03:54:29.460 align:start position:0%
here again uh if we're looking at a car
 
03:54:32.090 --> 03:54:32.100 align:start position:0%
uh of
 
03:54:35.929 --> 03:54:35.939 align:start position:0%
and antique car is not driven very very
 
03:54:39.469 --> 03:54:39.479 align:start position:0%
often uh if it's kept out and I doubt if
 
03:54:41.450 --> 03:54:41.460 align:start position:0%
anybody when the antique car keeps it
 
03:54:44.030 --> 03:54:44.040 align:start position:0%
out outside those rubber components it's
 
03:54:46.969 --> 03:54:46.979 align:start position:0%
it's the weather that that gets to gets
 
03:54:48.950 --> 03:54:48.960 align:start position:0%
to them and the UV rays from the from
 
03:54:51.290 --> 03:54:51.300 align:start position:0%
the from the Sun
 
03:54:56.150 --> 03:54:56.160 align:start position:0%
um you know I uh a day a a daily a car
 
03:54:57.410 --> 03:54:57.420 align:start position:0%
that's that's
 
03:54:59.570 --> 03:54:59.580 align:start position:0%
daily driven it's kind of is going to go
 
03:55:03.170 --> 03:55:03.180 align:start position:0%
over the 5 000 mile mile limit for
 
03:55:05.870 --> 03:55:05.880 align:start position:0%
uh fairly quickly I think so you're
 
03:55:08.330 --> 03:55:08.340 align:start position:0%
you're back to doing doing doing the
 
03:55:11.150 --> 03:55:11.160 align:start position:0%
inspection uh but you know here again
 
03:55:13.309 --> 03:55:13.319 align:start position:0%
like I said I don't
 
03:55:15.309 --> 03:55:15.319 align:start position:0%
I've come from a state without any in
 
03:55:18.410 --> 03:55:18.420 align:start position:0%
inspections and I don't see I don't I
 
03:55:20.150 --> 03:55:20.160 align:start position:0%
didn't see any more problems down there
 
03:55:22.729 --> 03:55:22.739 align:start position:0%
than we do we than we have than we have
 
03:55:25.250 --> 03:55:25.260 align:start position:0%
here so that's where I'm I'm kind of on
 
03:55:27.650 --> 03:55:27.660 align:start position:0%
the fence level you know what is the
 
03:55:29.990 --> 03:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
goal of inspection I mean I think the
 
03:55:31.729 --> 03:55:31.739 align:start position:0%
first primary goal is to keep our roads
 
03:55:33.969 --> 03:55:33.979 align:start position:0%
safe but there's a lot of states without
 
03:55:36.769 --> 03:55:36.779 align:start position:0%
inspections that I don't think have any
 
03:55:41.450 --> 03:55:41.460 align:start position:0%
Better or Worse safety as they uh than
 
03:55:43.309 --> 03:55:43.319 align:start position:0%
the city and then the state of New
 
03:55:43.319 --> 03:55:44.510 align:start position:0%
the city and then the state of New
Hampshire

03:55:44.510 --> 03:55:44.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
03:55:47.030 --> 03:55:47.040 align:start position:0%
so at least from at least from my my
 
03:55:47.040 --> 03:55:50.389 align:start position:0%
so at least from at least from my my
experience

03:55:50.389 --> 03:55:50.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:53.210 --> 03:55:53.220 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
03:55:55.790 --> 03:55:55.800 align:start position:0%
representative Sinclair
 
03:55:57.349 --> 03:55:57.359 align:start position:0%
thank you you answered one of my
 
03:55:59.750 --> 03:55:59.760 align:start position:0%
questions as to emphasize that you come
 
03:56:01.550 --> 03:56:01.560 align:start position:0%
from a state with no inspections at all
 
03:56:03.889 --> 03:56:03.899 align:start position:0%
although they do have emission control
 
03:56:06.110 --> 03:56:06.120 align:start position:0%
they have emissions for the first 20
 
03:56:08.689 --> 03:56:08.699 align:start position:0%
years of the car's life every two years
 
03:56:12.889 --> 03:56:12.899 align:start position:0%
they check emissions they have they have
 
03:56:14.450 --> 03:56:14.460 align:start position:0%
they used to have tailpipe emissions
 
03:56:16.010 --> 03:56:16.020 align:start position:0%
where they actually put the probe in the
 
03:56:18.769 --> 03:56:18.779 align:start position:0%
tailpipe which to me is a true test okay
 
03:56:22.130 --> 03:56:22.140 align:start position:0%
and one follow-up if I may well thank
 
03:56:25.550 --> 03:56:25.560 align:start position:0%
you um and would you not agree that the
 
03:56:28.250 --> 03:56:28.260 align:start position:0%
the owners of I would probably say close
 
03:56:31.130 --> 03:56:31.140 align:start position:0%
to 100 percent of the people that loved
 
03:56:33.290 --> 03:56:33.300 align:start position:0%
dearly these antique vehicles of theirs
 
03:56:35.689 --> 03:56:35.699 align:start position:0%
pay very close attention to all the
 
03:56:37.849 --> 03:56:37.859 align:start position:0%
mechanical components of the vehicle
 
03:56:40.490 --> 03:56:40.500 align:start position:0%
correct thank you
 
03:56:42.050 --> 03:56:42.060 align:start position:0%
um if you
 
03:56:43.849 --> 03:56:43.859 align:start position:0%
you're interested
 
03:56:45.229 --> 03:56:45.239 align:start position:0%
I have
 
03:56:48.530 --> 03:56:48.540 align:start position:0%
pictures of what of two of the two of
 
03:56:50.389 --> 03:56:50.399 align:start position:0%
them the bottom of two or two of my my
 
03:56:50.399 --> 03:56:52.010 align:start position:0%
them the bottom of two or two of my my
cars

03:56:52.010 --> 03:56:52.020 align:start position:0%
cars
 
03:56:54.050 --> 03:56:54.060 align:start position:0%
I mean the bottom of my car is as clean
 
03:56:57.110 --> 03:56:57.120 align:start position:0%
as the top side of my cars and that's
 
03:56:59.269 --> 03:56:59.279 align:start position:0%
why I do not want to take them on a
 
03:57:03.590 --> 03:57:03.600 align:start position:0%
salty salty roads and I'm also
 
03:57:06.050 --> 03:57:06.060 align:start position:0%

mechanic
 
03:57:09.710 --> 03:57:09.720 align:start position:0%
um I've heard some horror stories of
 
03:57:11.570 --> 03:57:11.580 align:start position:0%
people in a mustang club bringing them
 
03:57:13.969 --> 03:57:13.979 align:start position:0%
to a garage and
 
03:57:16.490 --> 03:57:16.500 align:start position:0%
um the mechanic had no looking at a 66
 
03:57:18.410 --> 03:57:18.420 align:start position:0%
Mustang and he didn't understand the
 
03:57:21.830 --> 03:57:21.840 align:start position:0%
mechanics behind the 66 Mustang you know
 
03:57:24.110 --> 03:57:24.120 align:start position:0%
you get a 25 year old
 
03:57:26.630 --> 03:57:26.640 align:start position:0%
kid that's working for a garage with the
 
03:57:28.849 --> 03:57:28.859 align:start position:0%
certification that they can inspect and
 
03:57:32.150 --> 03:57:32.160 align:start position:0%
he's never seen a 1960 series car
 
03:57:36.729 --> 03:57:36.739 align:start position:0%
and uh nor even know how to start it
 
03:57:39.650 --> 03:57:39.660 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
03:57:45.530 --> 03:57:45.540 align:start position:0%

things that I've heard I may take a
 
03:58:10.610 --> 03:58:10.620 align:start position:0%
slight bit more than three minutes just
 
03:58:11.870 --> 03:58:11.880 align:start position:0%
to be able to respond to some of the
 
03:58:13.910 --> 03:58:13.920 align:start position:0%

03:58:15.650 --> 03:58:15.660 align:start position:0%

Dealers Association
 
03:58:22.130 --> 03:58:22.140 align:start position:0%
um we are here on HB 54 in the fact that
 
03:58:24.410 --> 03:58:24.420 align:start position:0%
we both support and oppose the bill as
 
03:58:25.910 --> 03:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
there are two different sections of it
 
03:58:27.830 --> 03:58:27.840 align:start position:0%
two distinctly different sections of the
 
03:58:30.889 --> 03:58:30.899 align:start position:0%
bill primarily to begin with the move uh
 
03:58:33.429 --> 03:58:33.439 align:start position:0%
based on the uh the month of inspection
 
03:58:36.170 --> 03:58:36.180 align:start position:0%
is entirely reasonable based on weather
 
03:58:38.330 --> 03:58:38.340 align:start position:0%
and we we do in fact support that
 
03:58:41.030 --> 03:58:41.040 align:start position:0%
provision this is only further
 
03:58:43.070 --> 03:58:43.080 align:start position:0%
emphasized or coupled with the fact that
 
03:58:45.050 --> 03:58:45.060 align:start position:0%
we do have the billability in New
 
03:58:46.729 --> 03:58:46.739 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to inspect Vehicles four
 
03:58:49.070 --> 03:58:49.080 align:start position:0%
months earlier than their required
 
03:58:51.110 --> 03:58:51.120 align:start position:0%
inspection date so if someone really did
 
03:58:55.130 --> 03:58:55.140 align:start position:0%
have a parade to tend to uh in April or
 
03:58:56.750 --> 03:58:56.760 align:start position:0%
the months prior they would be able to
 
03:58:58.910 --> 03:58:58.920 align:start position:0%
inspect uh even four months before that
 
03:59:01.130 --> 03:59:01.140 align:start position:0%
may date so an entirely logical
 
03:59:02.870 --> 03:59:02.880 align:start position:0%
adjustment um
 
03:59:04.910 --> 03:59:04.920 align:start position:0%
the second section of the bill however
 
03:59:08.570 --> 03:59:08.580 align:start position:0%
that we do in fact oppose is the 5000 uh
 
03:59:10.189 --> 03:59:10.199 align:start position:0%
every two years or 2500 per year
 
03:59:12.110 --> 03:59:12.120 align:start position:0%
inspection exemption
 
03:59:14.150 --> 03:59:14.160 align:start position:0%
um antiques
 
03:59:16.969 --> 03:59:16.979 align:start position:0%
um are not intended for daily use so
 
03:59:20.269 --> 03:59:20.279 align:start position:0%
2500 miles is a lot of parades that I
 
03:59:22.429 --> 03:59:22.439 align:start position:0%
can see so that number the starting
 
03:59:24.050 --> 03:59:24.060 align:start position:0%
point for that number I'm not even
 
03:59:25.429 --> 03:59:25.439 align:start position:0%
really sure
 
03:59:27.229 --> 03:59:27.239 align:start position:0%
um where that came from
 
03:59:29.689 --> 03:59:29.699 align:start position:0%
um it's our opinion that this bill will
 
03:59:31.610 --> 03:59:31.620 align:start position:0%
basically give a blanket pass for
 
03:59:31.620 --> 03:59:33.110 align:start position:0%
basically give a blanket pass for
anything

03:59:33.110 --> 03:59:33.120 align:start position:0%
anything
 
03:59:35.170 --> 03:59:35.180 align:start position:0%
um registered as an antique
 
03:59:39.050 --> 03:59:39.060 align:start position:0%
to just not seek or require a safety
 
03:59:39.060 --> 03:59:39.910 align:start position:0%
to just not seek or require a safety
inspection

03:59:39.910 --> 03:59:39.920 align:start position:0%
inspection
 
03:59:41.929 --> 03:59:41.939 align:start position:0%
representative Sinclair I agree with you
 
03:59:44.330 --> 03:59:44.340 align:start position:0%
that are there are many and hundreds of
 
03:59:48.170 --> 03:59:48.180 align:start position:0%
antique owners some in this room who are
 
03:59:50.330 --> 03:59:50.340 align:start position:0%
passionate about their vehicles maintain
 
03:59:53.210 --> 03:59:53.220 align:start position:0%
them immaculately it is their projects
 
03:59:55.849 --> 03:59:55.859 align:start position:0%
and pride and joy and hobby however
 
03:59:57.950 --> 03:59:57.960 align:start position:0%
there are also folks that use the
 
04:00:00.530 --> 04:00:00.540 align:start position:0%
antique exemption as a way to seek out
 
04:00:03.769 --> 04:00:03.779 align:start position:0%
cheaper registration fees and that is
 
04:00:06.110 --> 04:00:06.120 align:start position:0%
their motivation so it's not all car
 
04:00:08.150 --> 04:00:08.160 align:start position:0%
lovers it's also sometimes an
 
04:00:10.670 --> 04:00:10.680 align:start position:0%
opportunity to find a reduction in fees
 
04:00:13.189 --> 04:00:13.199 align:start position:0%
so there are we're concerned about
 
04:00:15.769 --> 04:00:15.779 align:start position:0%
um those folks
 
04:00:17.570 --> 04:00:17.580 align:start position:0%
the other component that I'll mention is
 
04:00:19.510 --> 04:00:19.520 align:start position:0%
just strict enforcement
 
04:00:22.849 --> 04:00:22.859 align:start position:0%
so mileage is not tracked at point of
 
04:00:25.130 --> 04:00:25.140 align:start position:0%
registration with your town clerk so if
 
04:00:28.070 --> 04:00:28.080 align:start position:0%
the inspection goes away who in fact is
 
04:00:31.370 --> 04:00:31.380 align:start position:0%
going to be the enforcer of that 5 000
 
04:00:34.729 --> 04:00:34.739 align:start position:0%
mile or 2500 per year is State Police
 
04:00:37.189 --> 04:00:37.199 align:start position:0%
going to be required to pull over every
 
04:00:38.990 --> 04:00:39.000 align:start position:0%
vehicle that has an antique
 
04:00:40.929 --> 04:00:40.939 align:start position:0%
and then how do they in fact track that
 
04:00:43.189 --> 04:00:43.199 align:start position:0%
is the town clerk going to serve as the
 
04:00:44.570 --> 04:00:44.580 align:start position:0%
enforcement agent to say well you did
 
04:00:47.929 --> 04:00:47.939 align:start position:0%
499 or you did five zero zero three now
 
04:00:49.490 --> 04:00:49.500 align:start position:0%
you got to go get inspection come back
 
04:00:50.689 --> 04:00:50.699 align:start position:0%
to me then I'll give you your
 
04:00:52.610 --> 04:00:52.620 align:start position:0%
registration so that's problematic there
 
04:00:54.110 --> 04:00:54.120 align:start position:0%
in the enforcement
 
04:00:54.120 --> 04:00:55.429 align:start position:0%
in the enforcement
um

04:00:55.429 --> 04:00:55.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:00:59.090 --> 04:00:59.100 align:start position:0%
uh as mentioned there is a case that um
 
04:01:01.189 --> 04:01:01.199 align:start position:0%
that like representing Sinclair
 
04:01:02.330 --> 04:01:02.340 align:start position:0%
mentioned there's folks that keep those
 
04:01:03.830 --> 04:01:03.840 align:start position:0%
Vehicles Immaculate
 
04:01:05.809 --> 04:01:05.819 align:start position:0%
um however there are folks that the
 
04:01:07.610 --> 04:01:07.620 align:start position:0%
vehicles do in fact just sit
 
04:01:09.590 --> 04:01:09.600 align:start position:0%
um and when older vehicles just sit bad
 
04:01:13.969 --> 04:01:13.979 align:start position:0%
things happen dry rot on tires hoses uh
 
04:01:17.510 --> 04:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
leaking leaking gaskets can happen so um
 
04:01:19.370 --> 04:01:19.380 align:start position:0%
in some cases
 
04:01:22.130 --> 04:01:22.140 align:start position:0%
um not all but in some the inspections
 
04:01:24.110 --> 04:01:24.120 align:start position:0%
are necessary
 
04:01:27.229 --> 04:01:27.239 align:start position:0%
um you know uh step vehicles that sit
 
04:01:28.790 --> 04:01:28.800 align:start position:0%
I'm sure some of you have all seen
 
04:01:30.710 --> 04:01:30.720 align:start position:0%
hopefully not been witnessed to
 
04:01:32.510 --> 04:01:32.520 align:start position:0%
um with vehicles that sit tons sometimes
 
04:01:34.370 --> 04:01:34.380 align:start position:0%
we have rodents that make a home
 
04:01:36.290 --> 04:01:36.300 align:start position:0%
and the Damage that they do can do
 
04:01:39.530 --> 04:01:39.540 align:start position:0%
inside a vehicle so
 
04:01:40.969 --> 04:01:40.979 align:start position:0%
um just moving on to some of the
 
04:01:42.769 --> 04:01:42.779 align:start position:0%
questions that I heard
 
04:01:42.779 --> 04:01:43.969 align:start position:0%
questions that I heard
um

04:01:43.969 --> 04:01:43.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:01:46.189 --> 04:01:46.199 align:start position:0%
you know about you choose to register as
 
04:01:48.410 --> 04:01:48.420 align:start position:0%
an antique it's not a requirement you
 
04:01:49.910 --> 04:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
choose to once the vehicle reaches that
 
04:01:49.920 --> 04:01:51.590 align:start position:0%
choose to once the vehicle reaches that
that

04:01:51.590 --> 04:01:51.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:01:53.389 --> 04:01:53.399 align:start position:0%
um 25 year mark
 
04:01:55.790 --> 04:01:55.800 align:start position:0%
um again I don't know what the I don't
 
04:01:57.790 --> 04:01:57.800 align:start position:0%
know what the the mileage check will be
 
04:02:00.170 --> 04:02:00.180 align:start position:0%
the rules do in fact lay out the
 
04:02:01.790 --> 04:02:01.800 align:start position:0%
specifics for antique inspections I
 
04:02:04.130 --> 04:02:04.140 align:start position:0%
heard those questions uh some some of
 
04:02:05.929 --> 04:02:05.939 align:start position:0%
the same rules apply to everything but
 
04:02:09.650 --> 04:02:09.660 align:start position:0%
you cannot OBD2 test so you visually you
 
04:02:09.660 --> 04:02:10.809 align:start position:0%
you cannot OBD2 test so you visually you
visually

04:02:10.809 --> 04:02:10.819 align:start position:0%
visually
 
04:02:13.370 --> 04:02:13.380 align:start position:0%
inspect the emission system make sure
 
04:02:14.929 --> 04:02:14.939 align:start position:0%
the canister is still there certain
 
04:02:16.250 --> 04:02:16.260 align:start position:0%
things so there still are a different
 
04:02:17.689 --> 04:02:17.699 align:start position:0%
set of inspection requirements for
 
04:02:17.699 --> 04:02:20.150 align:start position:0%
set of inspection requirements for
antiques

04:02:20.150 --> 04:02:20.160 align:start position:0%
antiques
 
04:02:22.670 --> 04:02:22.680 align:start position:0%
as far as how many antiques this applies
 
04:02:24.950 --> 04:02:24.960 align:start position:0%
to the DMV can certainly run your report
 
04:02:28.070 --> 04:02:28.080 align:start position:0%
as to how many registered antiques there
 
04:02:30.889 --> 04:02:30.899 align:start position:0%
are in the state down to the number
 
04:02:30.899 --> 04:02:31.490 align:start position:0%
are in the state down to the number
um

04:02:31.490 --> 04:02:31.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:02:33.349 --> 04:02:33.359 align:start position:0%
how many it would apply to is really
 
04:02:35.030 --> 04:02:35.040 align:start position:0%
kind of arbitrary or I guess we would
 
04:02:36.590 --> 04:02:36.600 align:start position:0%
just race to that number because once
 
04:02:37.849 --> 04:02:37.859 align:start position:0%
this goes into place none of them would
 
04:02:39.050 --> 04:02:39.060 align:start position:0%
really be inspected because there's no
 
04:02:41.389 --> 04:02:41.399 align:start position:0%
check on it a case could be made I
 
04:02:41.399 --> 04:02:42.170 align:start position:0%
check on it a case could be made I
believe

04:02:42.170 --> 04:02:42.180 align:start position:0%
believe
 
04:02:42.180 --> 04:02:43.189 align:start position:0%
believe
um

04:02:43.189 --> 04:02:43.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:02:45.110 --> 04:02:45.120 align:start position:0%
rust I heard a lot about rust rust is
 
04:02:46.250 --> 04:02:46.260 align:start position:0%
allowed in the state of New Hampshire
 
04:02:48.769 --> 04:02:48.779 align:start position:0%
two sessions ago you actually made a
 
04:02:51.170 --> 04:02:51.180 align:start position:0%
legislative effort to weaken the rust
 
04:02:56.510 --> 04:02:56.520 align:start position:0%
rules to afford consumers flexibility on
 
04:02:58.490 --> 04:02:58.500 align:start position:0%
their vehicle as it relates to rust so
 
04:03:01.250 --> 04:03:01.260 align:start position:0%
rust is in fact allowed however not If
 
04:03:04.490 --> 04:03:04.500 align:start position:0%
it creates an unsafe situation sharp or
 
04:03:07.189 --> 04:03:07.199 align:start position:0%
protruding edges fumes that enter a
 
04:03:09.290 --> 04:03:09.300 align:start position:0%
passenger cabin those are some of the
 
04:03:11.269 --> 04:03:11.279 align:start position:0%
cases where rust is in fact disallowed
 
04:03:11.279 --> 04:03:13.429 align:start position:0%
cases where rust is in fact disallowed
so

04:03:13.429 --> 04:03:13.439 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:03:15.349 --> 04:03:15.359 align:start position:0%
um I Heard the common two comments real
 
04:03:15.359 --> 04:03:16.130 align:start position:0%
um I Heard the common two comments real
quick

04:03:16.130 --> 04:03:16.140 align:start position:0%
quick
 
04:03:16.140 --> 04:03:17.150 align:start position:0%
quick
um

04:03:17.150 --> 04:03:17.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:03:19.370 --> 04:03:19.380 align:start position:0%
you know I heard about Bad actors it's
 
04:03:20.929 --> 04:03:20.939 align:start position:0%
correct there are Bad actors there's bad
 
04:03:22.790 --> 04:03:22.800 align:start position:0%
inspectors uh there's there's bad
 
04:03:25.070 --> 04:03:25.080 align:start position:0%
doctors lawyers contractors
 
04:03:27.290 --> 04:03:27.300 align:start position:0%
um I'm thankful that we live in a state
 
04:03:29.210 --> 04:03:29.220 align:start position:0%
that has checks on those
 
04:03:30.530 --> 04:03:30.540 align:start position:0%
um we have the Attorney General's office
 
04:03:31.849 --> 04:03:31.859 align:start position:0%
we have the autocap program that I
 
04:03:33.530 --> 04:03:33.540 align:start position:0%
mentioned to you before we have State
 
04:03:35.210 --> 04:03:35.220 align:start position:0%
Police Troop G in their inspection and
 
04:03:37.309 --> 04:03:37.319 align:start position:0%
enforcement unit so if there are in fact
 
04:03:39.469 --> 04:03:39.479 align:start position:0%
Bad actors we have
 
04:03:42.229 --> 04:03:42.239 align:start position:0%
um strict controls on enforcement
 
04:03:42.239 --> 04:03:43.670 align:start position:0%
um strict controls on enforcement
um

04:03:43.670 --> 04:03:43.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:03:46.910 --> 04:03:46.920 align:start position:0%
I heard comments about uh things linked
 
04:03:49.189 --> 04:03:49.199 align:start position:0%
to Carfax New Hampshire vehicle
 
04:03:50.269 --> 04:03:50.279 align:start position:0%
inspections have nothing to do with
 
04:03:52.910 --> 04:03:52.920 align:start position:0%
Carfax CARFAX is an industry it's an
 
04:03:54.950 --> 04:03:54.960 align:start position:0%
insurance industry program that's
 
04:03:56.689 --> 04:03:56.699 align:start position:0%
related to accidents and injuries that
 
04:03:58.910 --> 04:03:58.920 align:start position:0%
were reportable it has nothing or no tie
 
04:04:00.290 --> 04:04:00.300 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire State safety
 
04:04:00.300 --> 04:04:01.490 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire State safety
inspections

04:04:01.490 --> 04:04:01.500 align:start position:0%
inspections
 
04:04:04.070 --> 04:04:04.080 align:start position:0%
um so uh with that being said just a
 
04:04:05.570 --> 04:04:05.580 align:start position:0%
couple comments that I had for you all
 
04:04:07.189 --> 04:04:07.199 align:start position:0%
and then a couple responses to some of
 
04:04:08.630 --> 04:04:08.640 align:start position:0%
the questions I hope they were helpful I
 
04:04:10.130 --> 04:04:10.140 align:start position:0%
hope they were informative
 
04:04:11.689 --> 04:04:11.699 align:start position:0%
um and I can be of assistance if there's
 
04:04:13.849 --> 04:04:13.859 align:start position:0%
any others that you may have
 
04:04:15.530 --> 04:04:15.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Bennett any questions from
 
04:04:19.610 --> 04:04:19.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:21.410 --> 04:04:21.420 align:start position:0%
let me get the question
 
04:04:26.630 --> 04:04:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:28.550 --> 04:04:28.560 align:start position:0%
um the question that I have is that this
 
04:04:33.110 --> 04:04:33.120 align:start position:0%
bill would um exempt Vehicles which are
 
04:04:36.170 --> 04:04:36.180 align:start position:0%
40 years old or older which means that
 
04:04:39.950 --> 04:04:39.960 align:start position:0%
any vehicle manufactured before 1982
 
04:04:42.889 --> 04:04:42.899 align:start position:0%
would be eligible for this and we've
 
04:04:44.929 --> 04:04:44.939 align:start position:0%
heard that I'm sorry to go on but we've
 
04:04:47.389 --> 04:04:47.399 align:start position:0%
heard that most antique vehicles are are
 
04:04:50.689 --> 04:04:50.699 align:start position:0%
kept in pristine condition what
 
04:04:53.090 --> 04:04:53.100 align:start position:0%
how many vehicles
 
04:04:53.100 --> 04:04:53.630 align:start position:0%
how many vehicles
um

04:04:53.630 --> 04:04:53.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:04:56.889 --> 04:04:56.899 align:start position:0%
that are of that age of the like 1980
 
04:05:00.229 --> 04:05:00.239 align:start position:0%
1982 might still be on the road
 
04:05:03.370 --> 04:05:03.380 align:start position:0%
um regularly I'm just um
 
04:05:06.170 --> 04:05:06.180 align:start position:0%
you know I'm thinking about pickup
 
04:05:08.030 --> 04:05:08.040 align:start position:0%
trucks and stuff that people keep for a
 
04:05:10.070 --> 04:05:10.080 align:start position:0%
long time is there any way to find that
 
04:05:12.469 --> 04:05:12.479 align:start position:0%
out thank you yeah so I'll do my best to
 
04:05:15.830 --> 04:05:15.840 align:start position:0%
answer it um so one DMV does have the
 
04:05:19.670 --> 04:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
registration date on on uh on antique
 
04:05:21.050 --> 04:05:21.060 align:start position:0%
Vehicles so they would be the ones that
 
04:05:22.610 --> 04:05:22.620 align:start position:0%
would be able to down to the vehicle
 
04:05:25.189 --> 04:05:25.199 align:start position:0%
Supply you that however antique Vehicles
 
04:05:27.889 --> 04:05:27.899 align:start position:0%
has two categories it's 40 plus and 25
 
04:05:30.290 --> 04:05:30.300 align:start position:0%
to 40. at 25 you are in fact eligible
 
04:05:32.269 --> 04:05:32.279 align:start position:0%
for an antique registration it just
 
04:05:33.769 --> 04:05:33.779 align:start position:0%
depends on your inspection cycle whether
 
04:05:36.110 --> 04:05:36.120 align:start position:0%
you have every year or every other year
 
04:05:40.490 --> 04:05:40.500 align:start position:0%
the average vehicle uh on the road these
 
04:05:43.550 --> 04:05:43.560 align:start position:0%
days is over 12 years so
 
04:05:44.870 --> 04:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
um you know vehicles have been
 
04:05:46.429 --> 04:05:46.439 align:start position:0%
manufactured over the past years in
 
04:05:48.830 --> 04:05:48.840 align:start position:0%
higher quality to last much much longer
 
04:05:51.349 --> 04:05:51.359 align:start position:0%
so it's not uncommon to see that 25-year
 
04:05:51.359 --> 04:05:53.750 align:start position:0%
so it's not uncommon to see that 25-year
vehicle

04:05:53.750 --> 04:05:53.760 align:start position:0%
vehicle
 
04:05:55.189 --> 04:05:55.199 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:05:57.950 --> 04:05:57.960 align:start position:0%
representative vayu
 
04:05:59.570 --> 04:05:59.580 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
04:06:01.550 --> 04:06:01.560 align:start position:0%
um it's it's possible to get it
 
04:06:03.530 --> 04:06:03.540 align:start position:0%
inspected up to four months prior to
 
04:06:06.889 --> 04:06:06.899 align:start position:0%
your date is it if you if it's April and
 
04:06:08.030 --> 04:06:08.040 align:start position:0%
you don't want to take it out can you
 
04:06:09.769 --> 04:06:09.779 align:start position:0%
have it done in May or is April you know
 
04:06:12.650 --> 04:06:12.660 align:start position:0%
April 30th the cut off
 
04:06:14.030 --> 04:06:14.040 align:start position:0%
can you have it done in May and
 
04:06:15.349 --> 04:06:15.359 align:start position:0%
essentially get an 11 month inspection
 
04:06:17.330 --> 04:06:17.340 align:start position:0%
or yeah representative thank you for
 
04:06:18.650 --> 04:06:18.660 align:start position:0%
your question you're actually allowed 10
 
04:06:20.870 --> 04:06:20.880 align:start position:0%
months excuse me 10 days into the next
 
04:06:24.349 --> 04:06:24.359 align:start position:0%
month so if you forgot your birthday was
 
04:06:27.050 --> 04:06:27.060 align:start position:0%
April you realize it on May 3rd you have
 
04:06:28.490 --> 04:06:28.500 align:start position:0%
a 10-day window to get down there at an
 
04:06:30.849 --> 04:06:30.859 align:start position:0%
inspection station to drive it without
 
04:06:34.429 --> 04:06:34.439 align:start position:0%
being guilty of driving an unsafe motor
 
04:06:36.610 --> 04:06:36.620 align:start position:0%
vehicle on the road
 
04:06:39.530 --> 04:06:39.540 align:start position:0%
there are some unique exemptions I don't
 
04:06:40.969 --> 04:06:40.979 align:start position:0%
know how often they're used and they
 
04:06:42.769 --> 04:06:42.779 align:start position:0%
have to be approved by the DMV I believe
 
04:06:45.889 --> 04:06:45.899 align:start position:0%
the director specifically to have a
 
04:06:48.110 --> 04:06:48.120 align:start position:0%
vehicle Drive outside of its inspection
 
04:06:48.120 --> 04:06:49.450 align:start position:0%
vehicle Drive outside of its inspection
cycle

04:06:49.450 --> 04:06:49.460 align:start position:0%
cycle
 
04:06:53.389 --> 04:06:53.399 align:start position:0%
you come into the inheritance of
 
04:06:55.010 --> 04:06:55.020 align:start position:0%
um you know your grandfather's Mustang
 
04:06:57.410 --> 04:06:57.420 align:start position:0%
that's been in the barn after you
 
04:06:59.210 --> 04:06:59.220 align:start position:0%
determine that it's roadworthiness you
 
04:07:00.410 --> 04:07:00.420 align:start position:0%
just need to get it to the inspection
 
04:07:03.550 --> 04:07:03.560 align:start position:0%
station you can get a 24-hour exemption
 
04:07:06.050 --> 04:07:06.060 align:start position:0%
it's a very narrow provision of the law
 
04:07:07.550 --> 04:07:07.560 align:start position:0%
I don't know how frequently it's
 
04:07:10.070 --> 04:07:10.080 align:start position:0%
actually used or it's actually been
 
04:07:13.670 --> 04:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
issued but four months prior ten days
 
04:07:16.010 --> 04:07:16.020 align:start position:0%
into the next month is the the rude
 
04:07:19.370 --> 04:07:19.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:21.950 --> 04:07:21.960 align:start position:0%
representative Sykes
 
04:07:25.370 --> 04:07:25.380 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I I'm curious to know
 
04:07:28.429 --> 04:07:28.439 align:start position:0%
from you if the DMV is on the list of
 
04:07:31.309 --> 04:07:31.319 align:start position:0%
pink cards that we got
 
04:07:35.330 --> 04:07:35.340 align:start position:0%
no all right so with that understanding
 
04:07:37.610 --> 04:07:37.620 align:start position:0%
is it possible for this committee to
 
04:07:42.050 --> 04:07:42.060 align:start position:0%
learn from the DMV the numbers of
 
04:07:44.929 --> 04:07:44.939 align:start position:0%
antique vehicles on the road the numbers
 
04:07:47.510 --> 04:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
of antique vehicles that may have failed
 
04:07:49.670 --> 04:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
inspection because that would have a
 
04:07:52.670 --> 04:07:52.680 align:start position:0%
bearing on our our discussions
 
04:07:59.929 --> 04:07:59.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:02.990 --> 04:08:03.000 align:start position:0%
representative Sinclair
 
04:08:05.689 --> 04:08:05.699 align:start position:0%
thank you we have a
 
04:08:08.689 --> 04:08:08.699 align:start position:0%
added thing here that the fiscal impact
 
04:08:10.610 --> 04:08:10.620 align:start position:0%
of this would be less than ten thousand
 
04:08:14.349 --> 04:08:14.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:17.389 --> 04:08:17.399 align:start position:0%
2023-26. do you have any idea what if
 
04:08:18.950 --> 04:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
this was to pass
 
04:08:22.849 --> 04:08:22.859 align:start position:0%
what the uh impact would be for the
 
04:08:26.150 --> 04:08:26.160 align:start position:0%
car dealers garages that do inspect
 
04:08:26.160 --> 04:08:28.130 align:start position:0%
car dealers garages that do inspect
vehicles

04:08:28.130 --> 04:08:28.140 align:start position:0%
vehicles
 
04:08:31.969 --> 04:08:31.979 align:start position:0%
I have no idea uh the fee for motor
 
04:08:34.130 --> 04:08:34.140 align:start position:0%
vehicle inspections is free market based
 
04:08:36.229 --> 04:08:36.239 align:start position:0%
and the state does not set a cap or a
 
04:08:38.630 --> 04:08:38.640 align:start position:0%
limit so it is up to the business to
 
04:08:40.010 --> 04:08:40.020 align:start position:0%
make the decision as to what their
 
04:08:41.929 --> 04:08:41.939 align:start position:0%
inspection fee would be so there's no
 
04:08:43.670 --> 04:08:43.680 align:start position:0%
straight calculation I could do where I
 
04:08:45.950 --> 04:08:45.960 align:start position:0%
could take 10 000 Vehicles times 199 and
 
04:08:47.870 --> 04:08:47.880 align:start position:0%
give you a number because it's like I
 
04:08:49.750 --> 04:08:49.760 align:start position:0%
said it's free market based the shop
 
04:08:53.210 --> 04:08:53.220 align:start position:0%
charges what it charges
 
04:08:54.530 --> 04:08:54.540 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
04:08:57.170 --> 04:08:57.180 align:start position:0%
have you heard from uh I'm pretty sure
 
04:08:59.630 --> 04:08:59.640 align:start position:0%
you represent that group of businesses
 
04:09:01.130 --> 04:09:01.140 align:start position:0%
have you heard of that they're against
 
04:09:03.710 --> 04:09:03.720 align:start position:0%
this or they're
 
04:09:07.550 --> 04:09:07.560 align:start position:0%
no support or any concern at all yeah uh
 
04:09:09.349 --> 04:09:09.359 align:start position:0%
so obviously like any trade Association
 
04:09:10.790 --> 04:09:10.800 align:start position:0%
like most trade associations we have a
 
04:09:12.349 --> 04:09:12.359 align:start position:0%
legislative committee that gets together
 
04:09:14.269 --> 04:09:14.279 align:start position:0%
that looks at bills of priority this
 
04:09:16.250 --> 04:09:16.260 align:start position:0%
bill was flagged for us and the exact
 
04:09:17.689 --> 04:09:17.699 align:start position:0%
opinion that I gave to you all which is
 
04:09:19.189 --> 04:09:19.199 align:start position:0%
we support the first half but not the
 
04:09:23.870 --> 04:09:23.880 align:start position:0%
second half is our is our opinion on it
 
04:09:25.849 --> 04:09:25.859 align:start position:0%
and they are those ins yeah they are
 
04:09:27.349 --> 04:09:27.359 align:start position:0%
those inspection stations repairs
 
04:09:28.910 --> 04:09:28.920 align:start position:0%
independent franchise that are
 
04:09:30.229 --> 04:09:30.239 align:start position:0%
represented the folks who are in the
 
04:09:32.150 --> 04:09:32.160 align:start position:0%
trenches day to day and that's where
 
04:09:35.210 --> 04:09:35.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:37.250 --> 04:09:37.260 align:start position:0%
representative C
 
04:09:40.309 --> 04:09:40.319 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh just to clarify
 
04:09:42.170 --> 04:09:42.180 align:start position:0%
you had said you were in favor of the
 
04:09:43.689 --> 04:09:43.699 align:start position:0%
first part and not the second part
 
04:09:47.389 --> 04:09:47.399 align:start position:0%
however the part regarding moving to the
 
04:09:50.030 --> 04:09:50.040 align:start position:0%
month of May from April is actually the
 
04:09:51.830 --> 04:09:51.840 align:start position:0%
second part
 
04:09:55.490 --> 04:09:55.500 align:start position:0%
that starts on line seven
 
04:09:57.170 --> 04:09:57.180 align:start position:0%
oh great catch representative see sorry
 
04:09:58.309 --> 04:09:58.319 align:start position:0%
about that I did it in the wrong order
 
04:09:59.870 --> 04:09:59.880 align:start position:0%
but I think everybody gets the concept
 
04:10:02.330 --> 04:10:02.340 align:start position:0%
the date move is okay the the mileage
 
04:10:04.250 --> 04:10:04.260 align:start position:0%
exemption we're not supportive of thank
 
04:10:05.269 --> 04:10:05.279 align:start position:0%
you thank you
 
04:10:07.130 --> 04:10:07.140 align:start position:0%
representative sellers
 
04:10:08.750 --> 04:10:08.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
04:10:10.729 --> 04:10:10.739 align:start position:0%
so if I understand the way this is
 
04:10:11.929 --> 04:10:11.939 align:start position:0%
written right now I'm just trying to
 
04:10:14.030 --> 04:10:14.040 align:start position:0%
figure this out if if I had an antique
 
04:10:17.510 --> 04:10:17.520 align:start position:0%
car and I drove it 500 miles one year
 
04:10:19.610 --> 04:10:19.620 align:start position:0%
500 the next
 
04:10:21.229 --> 04:10:21.239 align:start position:0%
and I'm supposed to get inspected every
 
04:10:23.809 --> 04:10:23.819 align:start position:0%
two years or could I do another 500 500
 
04:10:27.710 --> 04:10:27.720 align:start position:0%
is this a rolling two years or rolling 5
 
04:10:29.150 --> 04:10:29.160 align:start position:0%
000 anybody
 
04:10:32.229 --> 04:10:32.239 align:start position:0%
can update me on that
 
04:10:34.849 --> 04:10:34.859 align:start position:0%
uh yeah so
 
04:10:36.650 --> 04:10:36.660 align:start position:0%
um I'll give it a chance I'm not sure I
 
04:10:39.469 --> 04:10:39.479 align:start position:0%
entirely understand your line of
 
04:10:43.490 --> 04:10:43.500 align:start position:0%
questioning but inspections are done on
 
04:10:46.250 --> 04:10:46.260 align:start position:0%
a annual calendar it is not a cumulative
 
04:10:48.650 --> 04:10:48.660 align:start position:0%
mileage number it's not when you reach X
 
04:10:51.469 --> 04:10:51.479 align:start position:0%
you must do y it's a from here to here
 
04:10:53.809 --> 04:10:53.819 align:start position:0%
inspections are January to January June
 
04:10:55.010 --> 04:10:55.020 align:start position:0%
to June based on what your birth month
 
04:10:55.020 --> 04:10:58.189 align:start position:0%
to June based on what your birth month
is

04:10:58.189 --> 04:10:58.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:01.490 --> 04:11:01.500 align:start position:0%
follow-up thank you Mr I'm just looking
 
04:11:04.790 --> 04:11:04.800 align:start position:0%
at it says it shall not be required
 
04:11:06.349 --> 04:11:06.359 align:start position:0%
all right and and that's what I'm
 
04:11:08.689 --> 04:11:08.699 align:start position:0%
getting at the if the B if the vehicle
 
04:11:10.910 --> 04:11:10.920 align:start position:0%
has been driven less than 5 000 miles in
 
04:11:12.950 --> 04:11:12.960 align:start position:0%
the preceding two years
 
04:11:16.550 --> 04:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
so I'm just yeah so I I think I see
 
04:11:17.990 --> 04:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
where you're going so I guess a case
 
04:11:19.610 --> 04:11:19.620 align:start position:0%
could be made where there would be a
 
04:11:23.450 --> 04:11:23.460 align:start position:0%
scenario where you could drive 500 miles
 
04:11:25.429 --> 04:11:25.439 align:start position:0%
in year one because it was a really
 
04:11:28.010 --> 04:11:28.020 align:start position:0%
rainy parade season and then the next
 
04:11:30.229 --> 04:11:30.239 align:start position:0%
year we had beautiful weather and you
 
04:11:32.090 --> 04:11:32.100 align:start position:0%
slammed on
 
04:11:34.790 --> 04:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
you know another 5 000 miles in year two
 
04:11:37.070 --> 04:11:37.080 align:start position:0%
you'd be at fifty five hundred
 
04:11:39.229 --> 04:11:39.239 align:start position:0%
hence this wouldn't this exemption would
 
04:11:40.969 --> 04:11:40.979 align:start position:0%
not apply because at the end of your
 
04:11:42.650 --> 04:11:42.660 align:start position:0%
two-year cycle that's I'm just saying
 
04:11:44.150 --> 04:11:44.160 align:start position:0%
that's what I believe is being proposed
 
04:11:45.530 --> 04:11:45.540 align:start position:0%
here on paper at the end of that
 
04:11:47.450 --> 04:11:47.460 align:start position:0%
two-year cycle you'd be above the 5 000
 
04:11:50.389 --> 04:11:50.399 align:start position:0%
Mark so you'd be back into the current
 
04:11:52.490 --> 04:11:52.500 align:start position:0%
existing system
 
04:11:55.010 --> 04:11:55.020 align:start position:0%
um is I believe how this would function
 
04:11:55.020 --> 04:11:57.170 align:start position:0%
um is I believe how this would function
but

04:11:57.170 --> 04:11:57.180 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:12:00.769 --> 04:12:00.779 align:start position:0%
as I hope we never get there so
 
04:12:03.110 --> 04:12:03.120 align:start position:0%
representative Sykes
 
04:12:05.750 --> 04:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
so I'm just I'm not expecting an answer
 
04:12:08.950 --> 04:12:08.960 align:start position:0%
from you uh Mr Bennett but thank you
 
04:12:13.610 --> 04:12:13.620 align:start position:0%
conversely one could drive 500 miles a
 
04:12:13.620 --> 04:12:14.570 align:start position:0%
conversely one could drive 500 miles a
year

04:12:14.570 --> 04:12:14.580 align:start position:0%
year
 
04:12:17.090 --> 04:12:17.100 align:start position:0%
and in 10 years they'll only finally
 
04:12:20.269 --> 04:12:20.279 align:start position:0%
meet the 5 000 mile requirement does
 
04:12:23.030 --> 04:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
this bill envision
 
04:12:25.790 --> 04:12:25.800 align:start position:0%
um requiring the inspection every two
 
04:12:27.710 --> 04:12:27.720 align:start position:0%
years regardless of mileage I don't know
 
04:12:31.790 --> 04:12:31.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:33.650 --> 04:12:33.660 align:start position:0%
I'll answer it anyway my read is that
 
04:12:34.670 --> 04:12:34.680 align:start position:0%
you would never have the vehicle
 
04:12:36.229 --> 04:12:36.239 align:start position:0%
inspected ever
 
04:12:37.910 --> 04:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:12:40.910 --> 04:12:40.920 align:start position:0%
any further questions for the committee
 
04:12:43.729 --> 04:12:43.739 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Bennett thank you
 
04:12:45.710 --> 04:12:45.720 align:start position:0%
we do have someone here from the DMV
 
04:12:46.969 --> 04:12:46.979 align:start position:0%
that might be able to answer
 
04:12:50.650 --> 04:12:50.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:52.910 --> 04:12:52.920 align:start position:0%
Jeff hyperdig would you like to maybe
 
04:12:54.650 --> 04:12:54.660 align:start position:0%
follow up on the question that
 
04:12:58.490 --> 04:12:58.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:04.150 --> 04:13:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:07.070 --> 04:13:07.080 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chairman uh members of
 
04:13:08.210 --> 04:13:08.220 align:start position:0%
the committee for the record my name is
 
04:13:09.889 --> 04:13:09.899 align:start position:0%
Jeff orbernank and I am here
 
04:13:11.809 --> 04:13:11.819 align:start position:0%
representing Division of Motor Vehicles
 
04:13:14.269 --> 04:13:14.279 align:start position:0%
today I do have somebody looking up the
 
04:13:15.950 --> 04:13:15.960 align:start position:0%
numbers that you're looking for for
 
04:13:18.349 --> 04:13:18.359 align:start position:0%
antiques right now the number of
 
04:13:20.090 --> 04:13:20.100 align:start position:0%
antiques registered I should have in a
 
04:13:22.309 --> 04:13:22.319 align:start position:0%
few minutes but the number that have
 
04:13:23.870 --> 04:13:23.880 align:start position:0%
failed I'm going to get the last couple
 
04:13:25.610 --> 04:13:25.620 align:start position:0%
years worth of data that may take a few
 
04:13:26.990 --> 04:13:27.000 align:start position:0%
hours to get but we'll get those numbers
 
04:13:28.729 --> 04:13:28.739 align:start position:0%
for you
 
04:13:31.849 --> 04:13:31.859 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
04:13:33.410 --> 04:13:33.420 align:start position:0%
and if you can fill out a pink card it
 
04:13:36.950 --> 04:13:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:40.490 --> 04:13:40.500 align:start position:0%
representative Sinclair when you
 
04:13:42.110 --> 04:13:42.120 align:start position:0%
when you get the list of what they
 
04:13:44.090 --> 04:13:44.100 align:start position:0%
failed for can you break that down for
 
04:13:45.910 --> 04:13:45.920 align:start position:0%
instance did they fail for
 
04:13:48.410 --> 04:13:48.420 align:start position:0%
tires with not enough tread did they
 
04:13:50.689 --> 04:13:50.699 align:start position:0%
fail for bad breaks did they fail for
 
04:13:53.750 --> 04:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
body Rod frames that's because they're
 
04:13:57.410 --> 04:13:57.420 align:start position:0%
very really different uh really serious
 
04:13:59.150 --> 04:13:59.160 align:start position:0%
offenses that need to be really looked
 
04:14:02.030 --> 04:14:02.040 align:start position:0%
at versus wipers
 
04:14:06.889 --> 04:14:06.899 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:08.210 --> 04:14:08.220 align:start position:0%
um I'll tell you that when I get the
 
04:14:10.670 --> 04:14:10.680 align:start position:0%
report uh but the more detail I have
 
04:14:12.050 --> 04:14:12.060 align:start position:0%
then I mean I'll share everything we
 
04:14:14.030 --> 04:14:14.040 align:start position:0%
have so if I get the detailed report I
 
04:14:15.590 --> 04:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
can I can pass that along as well I'll
 
04:14:16.729 --> 04:14:16.739 align:start position:0%
get it out to the chair and you can
 
04:14:16.739 --> 04:14:19.610 align:start position:0%
get it out to the chair and you can
distribute

04:14:19.610 --> 04:14:19.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:21.590 --> 04:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
04:14:25.070 --> 04:14:25.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:27.110 --> 04:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
chair now like to recognize Lieutenant
 
04:14:28.849 --> 04:14:28.859 align:start position:0%
Jay O'Leary
 
04:14:34.189 --> 04:14:34.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:38.809 --> 04:14:38.819 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:40.670 --> 04:14:40.680 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chair members of
 
04:14:42.349 --> 04:14:42.359 align:start position:0%
committee Lieutenant Jay O'Leary from
 
04:14:44.990 --> 04:14:45.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire State Police Troop G
 
04:14:46.670 --> 04:14:46.680 align:start position:0%
as you'll find in most of the testimony
 
04:14:47.870 --> 04:14:47.880 align:start position:0%
I'll be providing today it will be
 
04:14:49.130 --> 04:14:49.140 align:start position:0%
educational and I will not have a
 
04:14:51.530 --> 04:14:51.540 align:start position:0%
position however I do want to just um
 
04:14:53.689 --> 04:14:53.699 align:start position:0%
point out a couple of things our
 
04:14:55.790 --> 04:14:55.800 align:start position:0%
concerns from an enforcement end on on
 
04:14:58.130 --> 04:14:58.140 align:start position:0%
this uh proposed bill
 
04:15:00.590 --> 04:15:00.600 align:start position:0%
in looking at essentially how a law
 
04:15:02.170 --> 04:15:02.180 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer would be able to
 
04:15:04.670 --> 04:15:04.680 align:start position:0%
ensure that a vehicle is in compliance
 
04:15:06.170 --> 04:15:06.180 align:start position:0%
with the the law the way that it would
 
04:15:08.870 --> 04:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
be written at the time in which the
 
04:15:10.790 --> 04:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
vehicle is inspected
 
04:15:13.130 --> 04:15:13.140 align:start position:0%
it would uh the mileage would be
 
04:15:15.469 --> 04:15:15.479 align:start position:0%
documented it's not as Dana mentioned
 
04:15:16.910 --> 04:15:16.920 align:start position:0%
it's not documented the town hall when
 
04:15:18.769 --> 04:15:18.779 align:start position:0%
it's registered so it would be
 
04:15:20.030 --> 04:15:20.040 align:start position:0%
documented when it's inspected that
 
04:15:21.950 --> 04:15:21.960 align:start position:0%
sticker then gets displayed on the
 
04:15:24.349 --> 04:15:24.359 align:start position:0%
vehicle itself so in theory when the law
 
04:15:26.210 --> 04:15:26.220 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer stops the vehicle
 
04:15:29.150 --> 04:15:29.160 align:start position:0%
the the uh they would be able to
 
04:15:31.189 --> 04:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
identify the mileage based on the
 
04:15:32.990 --> 04:15:33.000 align:start position:0%
sticker that's on the car
 
04:15:35.210 --> 04:15:35.220 align:start position:0%
the what becomes problematic with that
 
04:15:39.590 --> 04:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
approach is essentially the Violator
 
04:15:41.510 --> 04:15:41.520 align:start position:0%
the driver of the vehicle isn't
 
04:15:43.969 --> 04:15:43.979 align:start position:0%
necessarily in violation of the law if
 
04:15:45.889 --> 04:15:45.899 align:start position:0%
it's written this way because if they do
 
04:15:49.130 --> 04:15:49.140 align:start position:0%
have that 5 000 mile exemption in theory
 
04:15:52.010 --> 04:15:52.020 align:start position:0%
they could display an expired inspection
 
04:15:54.170 --> 04:15:54.180 align:start position:0%
sticker so a law enforcement officer
 
04:15:55.610 --> 04:15:55.620 align:start position:0%
coming the other way looks at the car
 
04:15:58.010 --> 04:15:58.020 align:start position:0%
sees that it's expired stops the vehicle
 
04:16:00.650 --> 04:16:00.660 align:start position:0%
on that premise and finds that in
 
04:16:02.389 --> 04:16:02.399 align:start position:0%
reviewing the mileage and the mileage
 
04:16:03.830 --> 04:16:03.840 align:start position:0%
that's on the on the motor vehicle
 
04:16:05.510 --> 04:16:05.520 align:start position:0%
itself that they're within that
 
04:16:07.790 --> 04:16:07.800 align:start position:0%
exemption what's problematic about that
 
04:16:10.130 --> 04:16:10.140 align:start position:0%
is the preface of the stop so our
 
04:16:12.170 --> 04:16:12.180 align:start position:0%
concern would be how can we track the
 
04:16:13.790 --> 04:16:13.800 align:start position:0%
mileage where we wouldn't be
 
04:16:16.849 --> 04:16:16.859 align:start position:0%
um you know providing a a an issue with
 
04:16:19.370 --> 04:16:19.380 align:start position:0%
the public and having to unnecessarily
 
04:16:20.929 --> 04:16:20.939 align:start position:0%
conduct motor vehicle stops for somebody
 
04:16:23.570 --> 04:16:23.580 align:start position:0%
that's in compliance with the law
 
04:16:26.269 --> 04:16:26.279 align:start position:0%
the second part that is
 
04:16:28.550 --> 04:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
of note would be that one of the items
 
04:16:30.769 --> 04:16:30.779 align:start position:0%
of inspection on these vehicles is the
 
04:16:33.710 --> 04:16:33.720 align:start position:0%
odometer so if the odometer is not an
 
04:16:35.570 --> 04:16:35.580 align:start position:0%
item that's inspected we're not really
 
04:16:37.370 --> 04:16:37.380 align:start position:0%
sure if it's functioning so potentially
 
04:16:40.010 --> 04:16:40.020 align:start position:0%
it could travel uh well over 5000 miles
 
04:16:42.170 --> 04:16:42.180 align:start position:0%
with a broken odometer and law
 
04:16:43.610 --> 04:16:43.620 align:start position:0%
enforcement would have no way of knowing
 
04:16:45.650 --> 04:16:45.660 align:start position:0%
that since the vehicle was not you know
 
04:16:47.450 --> 04:16:47.460 align:start position:0%
recently inspected
 
04:16:50.469 --> 04:16:50.479 align:start position:0%
as far as the 5000 mile
 
04:16:54.170 --> 04:16:54.180 align:start position:0%
exemption the confusion I think lies in
 
04:16:56.809 --> 04:16:56.819 align:start position:0%
the enforcement portion being does the
 
04:16:58.189 --> 04:16:58.199 align:start position:0%
new buyer of the vehicle then have to
 
04:17:00.110 --> 04:17:00.120 align:start position:0%
have the car inspected does the 5000
 
04:17:01.610 --> 04:17:01.620 align:start position:0%
miles now just roll over to the new
 
04:17:04.070 --> 04:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
purchaser of the vehicle and what that
 
04:17:06.830 --> 04:17:06.840 align:start position:0%
looks like so those are just on the
 
04:17:08.510 --> 04:17:08.520 align:start position:0%
enforcement issues that we're concerned
 
04:17:08.520 --> 04:17:11.090 align:start position:0%
enforcement issues that we're concerned
with

04:17:11.090 --> 04:17:11.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:13.849 --> 04:17:13.859 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee
 
04:17:15.889 --> 04:17:15.899 align:start position:0%
representative Sinclair
 
04:17:19.370 --> 04:17:19.380 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh I just I think I
 
04:17:20.870 --> 04:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
know the answer but I just want to hear
 
04:17:24.110 --> 04:17:24.120 align:start position:0%
it from you if you if a trooper stops a
 
04:17:26.269 --> 04:17:26.279 align:start position:0%
vehicle whether it's for a sticker that
 
04:17:29.389 --> 04:17:29.399 align:start position:0%
may be expired or anything else is it
 
04:17:31.250 --> 04:17:31.260 align:start position:0%
not a fact that the trooper does do a
 
04:17:33.769 --> 04:17:33.779 align:start position:0%
once-over of every vehicle to look for
 
04:17:38.269 --> 04:17:38.279 align:start position:0%
any obvious signs of unsafe tires or a
 
04:17:40.070 --> 04:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
headlight out or a brake light out or
 
04:17:41.750 --> 04:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
things like that no matter what the
 
04:17:43.309 --> 04:17:43.319 align:start position:0%
sticker says no matter what year the
 
04:17:45.710 --> 04:17:45.720 align:start position:0%
vehicle is uh I mean it could happen you
 
04:17:47.269 --> 04:17:47.279 align:start position:0%
know essentially that could be the
 
04:17:49.010 --> 04:17:49.020 align:start position:0%
reason why the vehicle is stopped to
 
04:17:50.570 --> 04:17:50.580 align:start position:0%
begin with because you do see such a
 
04:17:52.189 --> 04:17:52.199 align:start position:0%
violation like headlight out or so on
 
04:17:55.070 --> 04:17:55.080 align:start position:0%
and so forth so for every stop no but it
 
04:17:56.510 --> 04:17:56.520 align:start position:0%
is a reason and once in a while that we
 
04:17:58.610 --> 04:17:58.620 align:start position:0%
would do that okay thank you for your
 
04:17:58.620 --> 04:17:59.750 align:start position:0%
would do that okay thank you for your
question

04:17:59.750 --> 04:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:18:03.349 --> 04:18:03.359 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative of AU
 
04:18:06.590 --> 04:18:06.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for thank you Mr chairman um
 
04:18:09.349 --> 04:18:09.359 align:start position:0%
what if you have a situation where
 
04:18:11.990 --> 04:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
at the two-year Mark April
 
04:18:14.389 --> 04:18:14.399 align:start position:0%
you had driven only 4 900 miles so
 
04:18:15.710 --> 04:18:15.720 align:start position:0%
you're no longer you don't you're not
 
04:18:18.469 --> 04:18:18.479 align:start position:0%
required to inspect that year
 
04:18:20.929 --> 04:18:20.939 align:start position:0%
but by the end of May you're at over
 
04:18:23.210 --> 04:18:23.220 align:start position:0%
5000 how does the police officer know
 
04:18:26.389 --> 04:18:26.399 align:start position:0%
that you were under the 5 000 in April
 
04:18:27.830 --> 04:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
and you don't have to get it inspected
 
04:18:29.269 --> 04:18:29.279 align:start position:0%
for another two years yeah
 
04:18:30.469 --> 04:18:30.479 align:start position:0%
representative that's a that's a very
 
04:18:31.550 --> 04:18:31.560 align:start position:0%
good question and that's that's
 
04:18:34.010 --> 04:18:34.020 align:start position:0%
essentially what our uh you know our
 
04:18:35.210 --> 04:18:35.220 align:start position:0%
problem is with the way that it's
 
04:18:36.290 --> 04:18:36.300 align:start position:0%
written we're concerned that we're not
 
04:18:40.670 --> 04:18:40.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:43.070 --> 04:18:43.080 align:start position:0%
any further questions from the committee
 
04:18:46.490 --> 04:18:46.500 align:start position:0%
not seeing it on thank you lieutenant
 
04:18:48.290 --> 04:18:48.300 align:start position:0%
that's the last list of speakers I've
 
04:18:49.910 --> 04:18:49.920 align:start position:0%
had is anybody else that like to speak
 
04:18:53.269 --> 04:18:53.279 align:start position:0%
on HB 54.
 
04:18:55.070 --> 04:18:55.080 align:start position:0%
not seeing any
 
04:18:58.250 --> 04:18:58.260 align:start position:0%
I'm going to close the hearing on HP 54.
 
04:18:59.929 --> 04:18:59.939 align:start position:0%
next bill we're going to be taking up is
 
04:19:17.330 --> 04:19:17.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:19.010 --> 04:19:19.020 align:start position:0%
good job
 
04:19:19.020 --> 04:21:15.010 align:start position:0%
good job
laughs

04:21:15.010 --> 04:21:15.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:18.290 --> 04:21:18.300 align:start position:0%
there's really only one but there are
 
04:21:20.689 --> 04:21:20.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:36.130 --> 04:21:36.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:01.790 --> 04:22:01.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:04.490 --> 04:22:04.500 align:start position:0%
okay I like to open the open the public
 
04:22:08.389 --> 04:22:08.399 align:start position:0%
hearing on HB uh 111 establishing a
 
04:22:10.370 --> 04:22:10.380 align:start position:0%
committee to study electrical vehicle
 
04:22:13.370 --> 04:22:13.380 align:start position:0%
charging for residential renters and the
 
04:22:16.849 --> 04:22:16.859 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative Schultz
 
04:22:19.130 --> 04:22:19.140 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair Transportation
 
04:22:20.870 --> 04:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
committee members it's an honor to be
 
04:22:20.880 --> 04:22:22.250 align:start position:0%
committee members it's an honor to be
here

04:22:22.250 --> 04:22:22.260 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:22:22.260 --> 04:22:22.969 align:start position:0%
here
um

04:22:22.969 --> 04:22:22.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:22:25.910 --> 04:22:25.920 align:start position:0%
I'm here because I actually experienced
 
04:22:28.849 --> 04:22:28.859 align:start position:0%
this issue and and talking to others I
 
04:22:31.849 --> 04:22:31.859 align:start position:0%
realize this is a big question mark that
 
04:22:34.490 --> 04:22:34.500 align:start position:0%
maybe we as study commit committee
 
04:22:35.750 --> 04:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
members can
 
04:22:35.760 --> 04:22:36.410 align:start position:0%
members can
um

04:22:36.410 --> 04:22:36.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:22:38.809 --> 04:22:38.819 align:start position:0%
address in a way that maybe won't cost
 
04:22:41.990 --> 04:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
anything from the government Etc so
 
04:22:44.750 --> 04:22:44.760 align:start position:0%
um I am a rep here in Concord
 
04:22:47.570 --> 04:22:47.580 align:start position:0%
I did all my research because I had very
 
04:22:50.150 --> 04:22:50.160 align:start position:0%
tight criteria to purchase a car
 
04:22:53.510 --> 04:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
having my godfather works for uh Ford
 
04:22:56.150 --> 04:22:56.160 align:start position:0%
Motor Company building cars so it had to
 
04:22:57.650 --> 04:22:57.660 align:start position:0%
be a UAW car
 
04:22:59.750 --> 04:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
I had Consumer Reports it had to have a
 
04:23:02.870 --> 04:23:02.880 align:start position:0%
good rating and I wanted an electric car
 
04:23:04.490 --> 04:23:04.500 align:start position:0%
or hybrid
 
04:23:07.550 --> 04:23:07.560 align:start position:0%
so that got me down to the Ford Fusion
 
04:23:11.750 --> 04:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
of 20 2017 because I also am paying off
 
04:23:13.670 --> 04:23:13.680 align:start position:0%
student loans so it wasn't going to be a
 
04:23:14.870 --> 04:23:14.880 align:start position:0%
new car
 
04:23:17.870 --> 04:23:17.880 align:start position:0%
so after lots of research on that and
 
04:23:19.849 --> 04:23:19.859 align:start position:0%
realizing we would need to have a place
 
04:23:23.090 --> 04:23:23.100 align:start position:0%
to plug it in where we live we live at a
 
04:23:27.290 --> 04:23:27.300 align:start position:0%
complex that has over 400 units
 
04:23:29.929 --> 04:23:29.939 align:start position:0%
and all the parking spaces to match that
 
04:23:33.769 --> 04:23:33.779 align:start position:0%
and in in my district alone there are
 
04:23:36.590 --> 04:23:36.600 align:start position:0%
three other complexes that are roughly
 
04:23:38.450 --> 04:23:38.460 align:start position:0%
if you add them together about that many
 
04:23:41.809 --> 04:23:41.819 align:start position:0%
renders and none of them and as far as I
 
04:23:41.819 --> 04:23:42.729 align:start position:0%
renders and none of them and as far as I
know

04:23:42.729 --> 04:23:42.739 align:start position:0%
know
 
04:23:46.429 --> 04:23:46.439 align:start position:0%
uh none in Concord have any sort of
 
04:23:49.429 --> 04:23:49.439 align:start position:0%
ability for charging we were willing to
 
04:23:51.530 --> 04:23:51.540 align:start position:0%
pay for it ourselves we approached the
 
04:23:53.630 --> 04:23:53.640 align:start position:0%
landlord in that way and we were willing
 
04:23:55.429 --> 04:23:55.439 align:start position:0%
to leave behind whatever infrastructure
 
04:23:59.870 --> 04:23:59.880 align:start position:0%
we had with that including connecting it
 
04:24:02.210 --> 04:24:02.220 align:start position:0%
to our utilities because we do pay our
 
04:24:03.830 --> 04:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
own electric bills separate from the
 
04:24:06.889 --> 04:24:06.899 align:start position:0%
other renters and we also were paying
 
04:24:08.750 --> 04:24:08.760 align:start position:0%
for a parking space that was covered and
 
04:24:12.469 --> 04:24:12.479 align:start position:0%
had its own uh electric plug-in for
 
04:24:15.530 --> 04:24:15.540 align:start position:0%
everybody that had one of those
 
04:24:17.150 --> 04:24:17.160 align:start position:0%
um the answer I got from the landlord
 
04:24:18.530 --> 04:24:18.540 align:start position:0%
and I think they're pretty good
 
04:24:21.769 --> 04:24:21.779 align:start position:0%
landlords was hmm no one's ever asked
 
04:24:23.450 --> 04:24:23.460 align:start position:0%
for this
 
04:24:25.189 --> 04:24:25.199 align:start position:0%
um let me ask so then the management
 
04:24:27.410 --> 04:24:27.420 align:start position:0%
company company came back and said could
 
04:24:29.030 --> 04:24:29.040 align:start position:0%
you write a memo
 
04:24:31.610 --> 04:24:31.620 align:start position:0%
and the answer I had at the time as well
 
04:24:33.349 --> 04:24:33.359 align:start position:0%
we're about to lose this deal on this
 
04:24:36.229 --> 04:24:36.239 align:start position:0%
great car and so we bought a different a
 
04:24:37.849 --> 04:24:37.859 align:start position:0%
non um
 
04:24:41.870 --> 04:24:41.880 align:start position:0%
hybrid 2017 Ford Fusion but knowing that
 
04:24:43.790 --> 04:24:43.800 align:start position:0%
this will continue to be an issue I
 
04:24:45.110 --> 04:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
thought the next time I could file a
 
04:24:47.870 --> 04:24:47.880 align:start position:0%
bill this would be a great study to have
 
04:24:50.689 --> 04:24:50.699 align:start position:0%
um and get ahead of questions that a lot
 
04:24:53.450 --> 04:24:53.460 align:start position:0%
of hotels rest stops lots of other areas
 
04:24:55.130 --> 04:24:55.140 align:start position:0%
of the state have already thought this
 
04:24:58.250 --> 04:24:58.260 align:start position:0%
through and have charging stations and
 
04:24:59.950 --> 04:24:59.960 align:start position:0%
is more and more demand
 
04:25:02.330 --> 04:25:02.340 align:start position:0%
and I suspect
 
04:25:06.229 --> 04:25:06.239 align:start position:0%
uh many to most cars if not all cars at
 
04:25:09.110 --> 04:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
a certain age will be electric so this
 
04:25:10.189 --> 04:25:10.199 align:start position:0%
is something that I think would be
 
04:25:11.809 --> 04:25:11.819 align:start position:0%
helpful to
 
04:25:14.150 --> 04:25:14.160 align:start position:0%
the community in general it could be
 
04:25:15.969 --> 04:25:15.979 align:start position:0%
helpful to small
 
04:25:18.290 --> 04:25:18.300 align:start position:0%
to people who have
 
04:25:20.630 --> 04:25:20.640 align:start position:0%
one or two apartments to rent
 
04:25:23.090 --> 04:25:23.100 align:start position:0%
potentially it gets ahead of an issue
 
04:25:25.490 --> 04:25:25.500 align:start position:0%
that is coming regardless of your view
 
04:25:29.630 --> 04:25:29.640 align:start position:0%
of fossil fuels and electric cars
 
04:25:33.469 --> 04:25:33.479 align:start position:0%
um that is as simple as it gets so
 
04:25:37.490 --> 04:25:37.500 align:start position:0%
um to bring together the stakeholders uh
 
04:25:39.649 --> 04:25:39.659 align:start position:0%
you know utility companies if that's
 
04:25:42.010 --> 04:25:42.020 align:start position:0%
something that is needed certainly
 
04:25:47.030 --> 04:25:47.040 align:start position:0%
there are groups that Lobby for tenants
 
04:25:51.530 --> 04:25:51.540 align:start position:0%
and for landlords and you guys are the
 
04:25:53.990 --> 04:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
expert on transportation and cars not me
 
04:25:56.649 --> 04:25:56.659 align:start position:0%
so I definitely would welcome other
 
04:26:00.889 --> 04:26:00.899 align:start position:0%
stakeholders that would be helpful and
 
04:26:03.050 --> 04:26:03.060 align:start position:0%
just to have the Chipotle pull together
 
04:26:04.849 --> 04:26:04.859 align:start position:0%
in a bipartisan way to have the
 
04:26:04.859 --> 04:26:05.990 align:start position:0%
in a bipartisan way to have the
conversation

04:26:05.990 --> 04:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
04:26:08.630 --> 04:26:08.640 align:start position:0%
and then that memo can get written and
 
04:26:12.469 --> 04:26:12.479 align:start position:0%
be helpful to uh subsequent renters and
 
04:26:12.479 --> 04:26:13.729 align:start position:0%
be helpful to uh subsequent renters and
landlords

04:26:13.729 --> 04:26:13.739 align:start position:0%
landlords
 
04:26:16.429 --> 04:26:16.439 align:start position:0%
who are facing this issue
 
04:26:19.070 --> 04:26:19.080 align:start position:0%
that plain and simple
 
04:26:21.950 --> 04:26:21.960 align:start position:0%
thank you representative any questions
 
04:26:23.870 --> 04:26:23.880 align:start position:0%
representative Hill
 
04:26:25.490 --> 04:26:25.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
04:26:26.689 --> 04:26:26.699 align:start position:0%
taking my question representative
 
04:26:29.210 --> 04:26:29.220 align:start position:0%
absolutely nice to see you again
 
04:26:32.870 --> 04:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm curious uh if you are aware
 
04:26:36.349 --> 04:26:36.359 align:start position:0%
of any of the Senate three members that
 
04:26:38.210 --> 04:26:38.220 align:start position:0%
you list here would who would be willing
 
04:26:40.370 --> 04:26:40.380 align:start position:0%
to serve on such a committee it's funny
 
04:26:43.550 --> 04:26:43.560 align:start position:0%
you mention that because I paid so much
 
04:26:45.530 --> 04:26:45.540 align:start position:0%
attention to some my other bills I filed
 
04:26:48.590 --> 04:26:48.600 align:start position:0%
all of the bills I'm sponsoring at once
 
04:26:51.530 --> 04:26:51.540 align:start position:0%
at midnight the day we could file and I
 
04:26:52.969 --> 04:26:52.979 align:start position:0%
didn't there definitely you will hear
 
04:26:54.649 --> 04:26:54.659 align:start position:0%
other people that are interested I'm
 
04:26:58.729 --> 04:26:58.739 align:start position:0%
certain I can get three uh folks
 
04:27:00.649 --> 04:27:00.659 align:start position:0%
um I know of at least two Democrats I
 
04:27:02.929 --> 04:27:02.939 align:start position:0%
could get and I would love to hear any
 
04:27:04.670 --> 04:27:04.680 align:start position:0%
Republican suggestions on the right
 
04:27:06.769 --> 04:27:06.779 align:start position:0%
maybe a transportation Committee Member
 
04:27:09.670 --> 04:27:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:12.349 --> 04:27:12.359 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you uh thank you Mr
 
04:27:15.170 --> 04:27:15.180 align:start position:0%
chair um I'm wondering if
 
04:27:18.410 --> 04:27:18.420 align:start position:0%
um you explored I I think we have how
 
04:27:21.349 --> 04:27:21.359 align:start position:0%
many electric vehicle
 
04:27:24.110 --> 04:27:24.120 align:start position:0%
um committees already established are
 
04:27:27.050 --> 04:27:27.060 align:start position:0%
are these issues that are coming up in
 
04:27:29.809 --> 04:27:29.819 align:start position:0%
any of those are you aware of
 
04:27:32.929 --> 04:27:32.939 align:start position:0%
I don't believe so and honestly I
 
04:27:35.210 --> 04:27:35.220 align:start position:0%
thought this bill would go to
 
04:27:37.250 --> 04:27:37.260 align:start position:0%
um the committee that handles landlord
 
04:27:39.530 --> 04:27:39.540 align:start position:0%
and tenant law but that is a wisdom
 
04:27:43.490 --> 04:27:43.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:44.990 --> 04:27:45.000 align:start position:0%
any other further questions from the
 
04:27:49.370 --> 04:27:49.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:51.170 --> 04:27:51.180 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman representative
 
04:27:52.910 --> 04:27:52.920 align:start position:0%
Schultz it's your intention that this
 
04:27:54.830 --> 04:27:54.840 align:start position:0%
would be a committee not a commission
 
04:27:56.809 --> 04:27:56.819 align:start position:0%
and the difference being
 
04:27:59.450 --> 04:27:59.460 align:start position:0%
committee is just members of the house
 
04:28:03.050 --> 04:28:03.060 align:start position:0%
or Senate and that they can ask experts
 
04:28:05.030 --> 04:28:05.040 align:start position:0%
to come in but the experts would not be
 
04:28:08.030 --> 04:28:08.040 align:start position:0%
late called out as part of the study
 
04:28:10.729 --> 04:28:10.739 align:start position:0%
bill absolutely I saw this more as a
 
04:28:13.610 --> 04:28:13.620 align:start position:0%
formalization of Step Above ad hoc
 
04:28:15.590 --> 04:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
committee that anybody could that is a
 
04:28:17.689 --> 04:28:17.699 align:start position:0%
rep could set up but to have that
 
04:28:19.790 --> 04:28:19.800 align:start position:0%
formalization would be to include the
 
04:28:22.490 --> 04:28:22.500 align:start position:0%
bipartisan discussion and not just you
 
04:28:22.500 --> 04:28:23.330 align:start position:0%
bipartisan discussion and not just you
know

04:28:23.330 --> 04:28:23.340 align:start position:0%
know
 
04:28:25.969 --> 04:28:25.979 align:start position:0%
not just on a whim so but not as big as
 
04:28:29.750 --> 04:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:31.550 --> 04:28:31.560 align:start position:0%
representative C
 
04:28:35.090 --> 04:28:35.100 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh just uh
 
04:28:36.889 --> 04:28:36.899 align:start position:0%
curiosity and you may not know the
 
04:28:40.189 --> 04:28:40.199 align:start position:0%
answer uh do the various car brands have
 
04:28:44.210 --> 04:28:44.220 align:start position:0%
compatible connectors or uh do they just
 
04:28:46.689 --> 04:28:46.699 align:start position:0%
use 120 volts ac
 
04:28:50.689 --> 04:28:50.699 align:start position:0%
the charging stations at malls and stuff
 
04:28:52.670 --> 04:28:52.680 align:start position:0%
tend to have a special connector I think
 
04:28:54.649 --> 04:28:54.659 align:start position:0%
is just for one brand of car
 
04:28:57.110 --> 04:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
similar to cell phones I will say I know
 
04:28:59.469 --> 04:28:59.479 align:start position:0%
that this issue is being debated among
 
04:29:03.830 --> 04:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
both consumers and the companies
 
04:29:06.229 --> 04:29:06.239 align:start position:0%
I hope that there will be some
 
04:29:08.689 --> 04:29:08.699 align:start position:0%
standardization but you know there's a
 
04:29:10.790 --> 04:29:10.800 align:start position:0%
lot of pieces of this that I think need
 
04:29:13.570 --> 04:29:13.580 align:start position:0%
to be considered that I'll just say
 
04:29:16.130 --> 04:29:16.140 align:start position:0%
that's a debate that's bigger than this
 
04:29:18.530 --> 04:29:18.540 align:start position:0%
study commission or study committee
 
04:29:20.570 --> 04:29:20.580 align:start position:0%
should not use the word commission I
 
04:29:22.189 --> 04:29:22.199 align:start position:0%
just said the word commission
 
04:29:24.590 --> 04:29:24.600 align:start position:0%
um that this very modest study committee
 
04:29:27.290 --> 04:29:27.300 align:start position:0%
would not be probably settling any
 
04:29:29.450 --> 04:29:29.460 align:start position:0%
debates around hookups I do know though
 
04:29:31.429 --> 04:29:31.439 align:start position:0%
that there are programs some sponsored
 
04:29:34.250 --> 04:29:34.260 align:start position:0%
by companies some by maybe the federal
 
04:29:35.889 --> 04:29:35.899 align:start position:0%
government there used to be anyway
 
04:29:38.149 --> 04:29:38.159 align:start position:0%
programs to assist people to have
 
04:29:40.429 --> 04:29:40.439 align:start position:0%
hookups I don't know the answer to those
 
04:29:42.170 --> 04:29:42.180 align:start position:0%
questions right now though and I think
 
04:29:43.849 --> 04:29:43.859 align:start position:0%
that's great to include on the agenda
 
04:29:47.389 --> 04:29:47.399 align:start position:0%
for this modest study committee
 
04:29:50.030 --> 04:29:50.040 align:start position:0%
just for uh kind of just for the
 
04:29:51.590 --> 04:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
committee we heard testimony and lost
 
04:29:53.889 --> 04:29:53.899 align:start position:0%
term regarding this specific question
 
04:29:56.450 --> 04:29:56.460 align:start position:0%
regarding connectors with the different
 
04:29:58.429 --> 04:29:58.439 align:start position:0%
electrical vehicles and they're all
 
04:29:58.439 --> 04:30:00.290 align:start position:0%
electrical vehicles and they're all
different

04:30:00.290 --> 04:30:00.300 align:start position:0%
different
 
04:30:01.969 --> 04:30:01.979 align:start position:0%
here's what I do know if you don't mind
 
04:30:03.530 --> 04:30:03.540 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
04:30:06.710 --> 04:30:06.720 align:start position:0%
um I do know from my research that I
 
04:30:10.010 --> 04:30:10.020 align:start position:0%
there are there are hookups for that car
 
04:30:12.710 --> 04:30:12.720 align:start position:0%
that I was purchasing and I assume for
 
04:30:14.750 --> 04:30:14.760 align:start position:0%
the other types of electric vehicles as
 
04:30:17.210 --> 04:30:17.220 align:start position:0%
well that would work well with what my
 
04:30:19.670 --> 04:30:19.680 align:start position:0%
apartment complex had at our covered
 
04:30:22.370 --> 04:30:22.380 align:start position:0%
parking spaces given that we each had an
 
04:30:25.250 --> 04:30:25.260 align:start position:0%
electrical outlet that was standard it
 
04:30:27.649 --> 04:30:27.659 align:start position:0%
is adaptable as far as I understand it
 
04:30:30.170 --> 04:30:30.180 align:start position:0%
that the equipment overall for
 
04:30:33.830 --> 04:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
individual homeowner use is fairly uh
 
04:30:36.530 --> 04:30:36.540 align:start position:0%
user friendly and I don't think it's
 
04:30:39.530 --> 04:30:39.540 align:start position:0%
that expensive either so there are types
 
04:30:41.630 --> 04:30:41.640 align:start position:0%
that become more permanent like if it
 
04:30:43.309 --> 04:30:43.319 align:start position:0%
were instead of a covered parking space
 
04:30:46.370 --> 04:30:46.380 align:start position:0%
it would the types that would be for
 
04:30:49.870 --> 04:30:49.880 align:start position:0%
example solar based that would be at the
 
04:30:52.429 --> 04:30:52.439 align:start position:0%
non-covered spots that are not reserved
 
04:30:54.469 --> 04:30:54.479 align:start position:0%
at least in my complex some have
 
04:30:57.410 --> 04:30:57.420 align:start position:0%
reserved parking spaces at complexes per
 
04:30:57.420 --> 04:30:58.809 align:start position:0%
reserved parking spaces at complexes per
apartments

04:30:58.809 --> 04:30:58.819 align:start position:0%
apartments
 
04:31:02.269 --> 04:31:02.279 align:start position:0%
that also would be CR great to have and
 
04:31:03.950 --> 04:31:03.960 align:start position:0%
those would be more permanent and work
 
04:31:07.070 --> 04:31:07.080 align:start position:0%
with the utilities as well but to some
 
04:31:09.110 --> 04:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
degree some of them would
 
04:31:12.469 --> 04:31:12.479 align:start position:0%
um this is an evolving thing but no
 
04:31:14.809 --> 04:31:14.819 align:start position:0%
doubt I'm not the first resident in
 
04:31:17.149 --> 04:31:17.159 align:start position:0%
Concord that rents
 
04:31:20.210 --> 04:31:20.220 align:start position:0%
to want to have this
 
04:31:21.830 --> 04:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
any further questions from the committee
 
04:31:23.929 --> 04:31:23.939 align:start position:0%
representative Rambo
 
04:31:25.309 --> 04:31:25.319 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
04:31:26.809 --> 04:31:26.819 align:start position:0%
representative Schultz uh this morning
 
04:31:28.910 --> 04:31:28.920 align:start position:0%
during our committee orientation and we
 
04:31:31.309 --> 04:31:31.319 align:start position:0%
had Department introductions the dot was
 
04:31:32.809 --> 04:31:32.819 align:start position:0%
talking a little bit about the New
 
04:31:35.269 --> 04:31:35.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Transportation Council which I
 
04:31:37.849 --> 04:31:37.859 align:start position:0%
admit I'm I'm still learning about and
 
04:31:41.570 --> 04:31:41.580 align:start position:0%
it talked about being opportunities that
 
04:31:43.010 --> 04:31:43.020 align:start position:0%
the council can serve in lieu of
 
04:31:44.450 --> 04:31:44.460 align:start position:0%
legislative study committees or
 
04:31:46.250 --> 04:31:46.260 align:start position:0%
commissions for setting emerging
 
04:31:49.130 --> 04:31:49.140 align:start position:0%
Technologies and modes to improve
 
04:31:51.290 --> 04:31:51.300 align:start position:0%
Transportation uh going forward I'm just
 
04:31:51.300 --> 04:31:52.490 align:start position:0%
Transportation uh going forward I'm just
wondering

04:31:52.490 --> 04:31:52.500 align:start position:0%
wondering
 
04:31:55.729 --> 04:31:55.739 align:start position:0%
if there is overlap or if there's a way
 
04:31:57.349 --> 04:31:57.359 align:start position:0%
within with the transportation Council
 
04:31:59.990 --> 04:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
be useful or helpful in in this scenario
 
04:32:02.870 --> 04:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
I would say so I think the what would be
 
04:32:04.969 --> 04:32:04.979 align:start position:0%
missing in that conversation and why
 
04:32:09.349 --> 04:32:09.359 align:start position:0%
having a a um modest not quite too
 
04:32:12.349 --> 04:32:12.359 align:start position:0%
formal study committee would be that we
 
04:32:14.750 --> 04:32:14.760 align:start position:0%
could more formally invite both the
 
04:32:17.330 --> 04:32:17.340 align:start position:0%
landlords and tenants in a way that may
 
04:32:20.090 --> 04:32:20.100 align:start position:0%
be just speaking to our state's
 
04:32:20.100 --> 04:32:21.410 align:start position:0%
be just speaking to our state's
Department

04:32:21.410 --> 04:32:21.420 align:start position:0%
Department
 
04:32:23.090 --> 04:32:23.100 align:start position:0%
maybe they would do that I don't know
 
04:32:25.490 --> 04:32:25.500 align:start position:0%
but it also would ensure the bipartisan
 
04:32:28.370 --> 04:32:28.380 align:start position:0%
discussion because I think
 
04:32:30.889 --> 04:32:30.899 align:start position:0%
um having diversity of thought is only
 
04:32:32.689 --> 04:32:32.699 align:start position:0%
going to make the end product more
 
04:32:32.699 --> 04:32:34.370 align:start position:0%
going to make the end product more
user-friendly

04:32:34.370 --> 04:32:34.380 align:start position:0%
user-friendly
 
04:32:37.610 --> 04:32:37.620 align:start position:0%
and what this study committee comes to
 
04:32:37.620 --> 04:32:39.170 align:start position:0%
and what this study committee comes to
recommend

04:32:39.170 --> 04:32:39.180 align:start position:0%
recommend
 
04:32:41.809 --> 04:32:41.819 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:32:43.370 --> 04:32:43.380 align:start position:0%
any further questions from the committee
 
04:32:45.830 --> 04:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
Representatives Jones
 
04:32:48.170 --> 04:32:48.180 align:start position:0%
two questions find me Mr chairman uh
 
04:32:50.689 --> 04:32:50.699 align:start position:0%
first um thank you for coming
 
04:32:50.699 --> 04:32:52.309 align:start position:0%
first um thank you for coming
representative

04:32:52.309 --> 04:32:52.319 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:32:55.490 --> 04:32:55.500 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned the uh the 110 I
 
04:32:57.170 --> 04:32:57.180 align:start position:0%
believe there's two forms there's the
 
04:32:59.330 --> 04:32:59.340 align:start position:0%
fast to slow charge which is a 110 which
 
04:33:01.070 --> 04:33:01.080 align:start position:0%
takes about eight hours and the fast
 
04:33:03.050 --> 04:33:03.060 align:start position:0%
charge I believe is a 220 which takes
 
04:33:05.570 --> 04:33:05.580 align:start position:0%
about two hours so that's something that
 
04:33:08.929 --> 04:33:08.939 align:start position:0%
this committee should look at and uh the
 
04:33:11.330 --> 04:33:11.340 align:start position:0%
other question
 
04:33:14.209 --> 04:33:14.219 align:start position:0%
um is uh are you aware that the
 
04:33:14.219 --> 04:33:16.189 align:start position:0%
um is uh are you aware that the
manufacturers

04:33:16.189 --> 04:33:16.199 align:start position:0%
manufacturers
 
04:33:21.170 --> 04:33:21.180 align:start position:0%
are because they want to sell EV cars
 
04:33:23.390 --> 04:33:23.400 align:start position:0%
they're offering the free infrastructure
 
04:33:25.310 --> 04:33:25.320 align:start position:0%
in public places I haven't heard of it
 
04:33:27.349 --> 04:33:27.359 align:start position:0%
yet in private places but it's something
 
04:33:29.390 --> 04:33:29.400 align:start position:0%
you might want to look into
 
04:33:31.849 --> 04:33:31.859 align:start position:0%
it would save you some money in New York
 
04:33:33.470 --> 04:33:33.480 align:start position:0%
that committee could sort of look into
 
04:33:35.570 --> 04:33:35.580 align:start position:0%
it absolutely and that was something
 
04:33:38.990 --> 04:33:39.000 align:start position:0%
that I was aware of as well as I knew at
 
04:33:40.551 --> 04:33:40.561 align:start position:0%
least when I bought this car two years
 
04:33:43.131 --> 04:33:43.141 align:start position:0%
ago when we were in the middle of covid
 
04:33:45.051 --> 04:33:45.061 align:start position:0%
there it was a part of I think one of
 
04:33:47.750 --> 04:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
the stimulus packages too
 
04:33:50.631 --> 04:33:50.641 align:start position:0%
um look at certain incentives
 
04:33:54.109 --> 04:33:54.119 align:start position:0%
uh to be made available to places that
 
04:33:57.230 --> 04:33:57.240 align:start position:0%
might have uh electric vehicles in their
 
04:34:00.170 --> 04:34:00.180 align:start position:0%
parking lots and I think that
 
04:34:00.180 --> 04:34:00.769 align:start position:0%
parking lots and I think that
um

04:34:00.769 --> 04:34:00.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:34:03.349 --> 04:34:03.359 align:start position:0%
those are good points for that and I
 
04:34:03.359 --> 04:34:04.970 align:start position:0%
those are good points for that and I
think

04:34:04.970 --> 04:34:04.980 align:start position:0%
think
 
04:34:06.650 --> 04:34:06.660 align:start position:0%
um I mean there's just a number of
 
04:34:08.689 --> 04:34:08.699 align:start position:0%
pieces we need to get ahead of on this
 
04:34:11.209 --> 04:34:11.219 align:start position:0%
and honestly even after the study report
 
04:34:13.970 --> 04:34:13.980 align:start position:0%
is written I'm sure that it will evolve
 
04:34:16.551 --> 04:34:16.561 align:start position:0%
in a much bigger way than our modest
 
04:34:20.209 --> 04:34:20.219 align:start position:0%
study committee will need to address
 
04:34:22.849 --> 04:34:22.859 align:start position:0%
any further questions from the committee
 
04:34:24.650 --> 04:34:24.660 align:start position:0%
not seeing none thank you representative
 
04:34:29.929 --> 04:34:29.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:31.369 --> 04:34:31.379 align:start position:0%
at this point that you're like to
 
04:34:34.310 --> 04:34:34.320 align:start position:0%
recognize representative Chris Schultz
 
04:34:36.529 --> 04:34:36.539 align:start position:0%
that was you okay well
 
04:34:41.510 --> 04:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:43.250 --> 04:34:43.260 align:start position:0%
the chair now recognizes representative
 
04:34:43.260 --> 04:34:45.349 align:start position:0%
the chair now recognizes representative

who supports the bill and is requested
 
04:34:58.609 --> 04:34:58.619 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:00.170 --> 04:35:00.180 align:start position:0%
thank you chair Walsh members of the
 
04:35:01.609 --> 04:35:01.619 align:start position:0%
committee my name is representative
 
04:35:03.949 --> 04:35:03.959 align:start position:0%
Rebecca McWilliams and for the record I
 
04:35:05.810 --> 04:35:05.820 align:start position:0%
represent South Concord you're actually
 
04:35:07.609 --> 04:35:07.619 align:start position:0%
part of my district right now so welcome
 
04:35:09.890 --> 04:35:09.900 align:start position:0%
to South Concord
 
04:35:10.970 --> 04:35:10.980 align:start position:0%
um I am a member of the science
 
04:35:12.590 --> 04:35:12.600 align:start position:0%
technology and energy committee so I
 
04:35:13.910 --> 04:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
felt that it was important to come in
 
04:35:15.650 --> 04:35:15.660 align:start position:0%
front of you and just have a quick
 
04:35:18.051 --> 04:35:18.061 align:start position:0%
discussion about the future of EVs and
 
04:35:20.330 --> 04:35:20.340 align:start position:0%
where we're headed as a state
 
04:35:22.490 --> 04:35:22.500 align:start position:0%
um specifically 30 percent of New
 
04:35:23.990 --> 04:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire rents
 
04:35:26.269 --> 04:35:26.279 align:start position:0%
so one out of three look around this
 
04:35:28.910 --> 04:35:28.920 align:start position:0%
room one in three is a renter
 
04:35:32.029 --> 04:35:32.039 align:start position:0%
what that means is eventually they'll
 
04:35:34.369 --> 04:35:34.379 align:start position:0%
probably be driving either a hybrid or
 
04:35:37.189 --> 04:35:37.199 align:start position:0%
an EV in the future and so we need to do
 
04:35:39.230 --> 04:35:39.240 align:start position:0%
something to set the groundwork now to
 
04:35:41.510 --> 04:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
figure out how that's going to work
 
04:35:43.670 --> 04:35:43.680 align:start position:0%
um certainly in my district I have folks
 
04:35:44.869 --> 04:35:44.879 align:start position:0%
who are in all kinds of interesting
 
04:35:47.810 --> 04:35:47.820 align:start position:0%
renting situations some of them are in
 
04:35:49.730 --> 04:35:49.740 align:start position:0%
duplexes and some of them are in
 
04:35:51.289 --> 04:35:51.299 align:start position:0%
apartment buildings with like what
 
04:35:53.449 --> 04:35:53.459 align:start position:0%
representative Schultz talks about 400
 
04:35:55.910 --> 04:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
people with outdoor parking and some of
 
04:35:58.490 --> 04:35:58.500 align:start position:0%
it covered some of it not so we have
 
04:36:00.230 --> 04:36:00.240 align:start position:0%
some interesting scenarios that are
 
04:36:01.789 --> 04:36:01.799 align:start position:0%
worth considering and putting a plan
 
04:36:04.070 --> 04:36:04.080 align:start position:0%
together for what does that look like to
 
04:36:06.289 --> 04:36:06.299 align:start position:0%
enable EV charging for these different
 
04:36:09.051 --> 04:36:09.061 align:start position:0%
types of renting situations also we have
 
04:36:12.709 --> 04:36:12.719 align:start position:0%
Urban versus Rural right so for someone
 
04:36:14.990 --> 04:36:15.000 align:start position:0%
who's a rural renter and is off a dirt
 
04:36:17.750 --> 04:36:17.760 align:start position:0%
road and you know old farmhouse and
 
04:36:19.310 --> 04:36:19.320 align:start position:0%
probably doesn't really have all that
 
04:36:21.410 --> 04:36:21.420 align:start position:0%
reliable electricity that may be a very
 
04:36:23.750 --> 04:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
different scenario for a tenant than
 
04:36:25.189 --> 04:36:25.199 align:start position:0%
somebody who's in an urban situation
 
04:36:27.890 --> 04:36:27.900 align:start position:0%
with 400 cars on a lot next to a big
 
04:36:30.709 --> 04:36:30.719 align:start position:0%
apartment apartment building
 
04:36:32.209 --> 04:36:32.219 align:start position:0%
um so I think that this bill brings up a
 
04:36:33.650 --> 04:36:33.660 align:start position:0%
lot of interesting questions about what
 
04:36:35.209 --> 04:36:35.219 align:start position:0%
does that look like and I think it would
 
04:36:36.709 --> 04:36:36.719 align:start position:0%
be a really great opportunity to have
 
04:36:38.390 --> 04:36:38.400 align:start position:0%
the discussion with landlords and
 
04:36:40.369 --> 04:36:40.379 align:start position:0%
tenants about what would be the best way
 
04:36:42.410 --> 04:36:42.420 align:start position:0%
for us to approach this so that it's not
 
04:36:43.970 --> 04:36:43.980 align:start position:0%
an ad hoc approach and so that there's
 
04:36:45.590 --> 04:36:45.600 align:start position:0%
at least some guidance
 
04:36:47.689 --> 04:36:47.699 align:start position:0%
for what happens next as the industry is
 
04:36:50.390 --> 04:36:50.400 align:start position:0%
changing so just as an example
 
04:36:52.551 --> 04:36:52.561 align:start position:0%
um we've had a really interesting study
 
04:36:55.551 --> 04:36:55.561 align:start position:0%
going on at UNH related to the Nissan
 
04:36:58.730 --> 04:36:58.740 align:start position:0%
Leaf which is I believe right now the
 
04:37:00.230 --> 04:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
only vehicle but there are more coming
 
04:37:03.410 --> 04:37:03.420 align:start position:0%
which you can both charge with your EV
 
04:37:05.869 --> 04:37:05.879 align:start position:0%
charging station and also you can plug
 
04:37:10.010 --> 04:37:10.020 align:start position:0%
in and recharge back into the grid so if
 
04:37:11.570 --> 04:37:11.580 align:start position:0%
you're in a renting situation let's say
 
04:37:13.429 --> 04:37:13.439 align:start position:0%
you're a college student and you drive a
 
04:37:14.631 --> 04:37:14.641 align:start position:0%
Nissan Leaf
 
04:37:16.310 --> 04:37:16.320 align:start position:0%
and you want to plug it in and charge it
 
04:37:17.810 --> 04:37:17.820 align:start position:0%
probably have it charge at two in the
 
04:37:20.029 --> 04:37:20.039 align:start position:0%
morning when it's super cheap to charge
 
04:37:22.910 --> 04:37:22.920 align:start position:0%
but also let's say you're in class from
 
04:37:25.609 --> 04:37:25.619 align:start position:0%
5 to 8 pm and that's when it's actually
 
04:37:26.929 --> 04:37:26.939 align:start position:0%
a really good time for you to charge
 
04:37:28.490 --> 04:37:28.500 align:start position:0%
back into the grid because you would be
 
04:37:31.189 --> 04:37:31.199 align:start position:0%
getting credits for peak time this is an
 
04:37:32.689 --> 04:37:32.699 align:start position:0%
interesting opportunity to make it
 
04:37:34.490 --> 04:37:34.500 align:start position:0%
somewhat lucrative or at least reduce
 
04:37:37.010 --> 04:37:37.020 align:start position:0%
your electric bill by using your car as
 
04:37:38.810 --> 04:37:38.820 align:start position:0%
a battery with your grid and the New
 
04:37:41.330 --> 04:37:41.340 align:start position:0%
Hampshire co-op is doing that now with
 
04:37:43.670 --> 04:37:43.680 align:start position:0%
this Nissan Leaf model expect this to
 
04:37:45.650 --> 04:37:45.660 align:start position:0%
roll out with other utilities at some
 
04:37:47.631 --> 04:37:47.641 align:start position:0%
point but I just want you to have a
 
04:37:48.949 --> 04:37:48.959 align:start position:0%
sense of the way the industry is going
 
04:37:50.689 --> 04:37:50.699 align:start position:0%
and how this could be really interesting
 
04:37:52.910 --> 04:37:52.920 align:start position:0%
it would be good to talk about it so
 
04:37:53.869 --> 04:37:53.879 align:start position:0%
with that I'm having to take some
 
04:37:53.879 --> 04:37:55.429 align:start position:0%
with that I'm having to take some
questions

04:37:55.429 --> 04:37:55.439 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:37:59.449 --> 04:37:59.459 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:01.310 --> 04:38:01.320 align:start position:0%
representative O'Hara
 
04:38:02.510 --> 04:38:02.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
04:38:03.769 --> 04:38:03.779 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:38:04.970 --> 04:38:04.980 align:start position:0%
um isn't this something the free market
 
04:38:07.010 --> 04:38:07.020 align:start position:0%
could clear up as in the more electric
 
04:38:09.470 --> 04:38:09.480 align:start position:0%
vehicles that are in the state landlords
 
04:38:11.750 --> 04:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
are going to want to add that feature to
 
04:38:13.429 --> 04:38:13.439 align:start position:0%
be able to either increase rent or
 
04:38:15.650 --> 04:38:15.660 align:start position:0%
attract more applicants
 
04:38:17.810 --> 04:38:17.820 align:start position:0%
I think the free market question is a
 
04:38:18.650 --> 04:38:18.660 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
04:38:20.150 --> 04:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
um like I could ask pre-market about
 
04:38:21.949 --> 04:38:21.959 align:start position:0%
anything really yeah the free market
 
04:38:24.051 --> 04:38:24.061 align:start position:0%
impacts our lives every day but when
 
04:38:25.369 --> 04:38:25.379 align:start position:0%
we're talking about making a plan for
 
04:38:28.189 --> 04:38:28.199 align:start position:0%
how landlords could Implement across the
 
04:38:30.230 --> 04:38:30.240 align:start position:0%
state I think it makes sense for us to
 
04:38:31.849 --> 04:38:31.859 align:start position:0%
come together and make a consensus for
 
04:38:33.650 --> 04:38:33.660 align:start position:0%
best practices and publish a report
 
04:38:34.910 --> 04:38:34.920 align:start position:0%
saying these are our best practice
 
04:38:37.490 --> 04:38:37.500 align:start position:0%
recommendations it doesn't impact the
 
04:38:39.590 --> 04:38:39.600 align:start position:0%
free market per se right the free market
 
04:38:40.910 --> 04:38:40.920 align:start position:0%
is going to do what the free market is
 
04:38:42.769 --> 04:38:42.779 align:start position:0%
going to do but we're providing some
 
04:38:44.869 --> 04:38:44.879 align:start position:0%
guidance that says it probably makes
 
04:38:46.429 --> 04:38:46.439 align:start position:0%
sense to provide a variety of different
 
04:38:48.650 --> 04:38:48.660 align:start position:0%
Chargers since we know that Teslas are
 
04:38:51.051 --> 04:38:51.061 align:start position:0%
their own special charger and a certain
 
04:38:53.029 --> 04:38:53.039 align:start position:0%
percentage might need Tesla Chargers but
 
04:38:54.709 --> 04:38:54.719 align:start position:0%
the approach for installing a Tesla
 
04:38:56.390 --> 04:38:56.400 align:start position:0%
charger for renters is probably going to
 
04:38:59.029 --> 04:38:59.039 align:start position:0%
be different than installing for a 220
 
04:39:02.029 --> 04:39:02.039 align:start position:0%
or 110 more standard charger and there
 
04:39:03.709 --> 04:39:03.719 align:start position:0%
are more coming out on the market so
 
04:39:05.449 --> 04:39:05.459 align:start position:0%
obviously that's a different discussion
 
04:39:07.789 --> 04:39:07.799 align:start position:0%
but something where we could then as the
 
04:39:09.170 --> 04:39:09.180 align:start position:0%
House of Representatives have some
 
04:39:11.510 --> 04:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
recommendations have some guidance I
 
04:39:13.490 --> 04:39:13.500 align:start position:0%
think a committee that's looking at that
 
04:39:15.590 --> 04:39:15.600 align:start position:0%
makes sense so really the free market is
 
04:39:18.051 --> 04:39:18.061 align:start position:0%
not really the question I think the real
 
04:39:20.029 --> 04:39:20.039 align:start position:0%
question is what can we come up with
 
04:39:22.369 --> 04:39:22.379 align:start position:0%
together as a team that are the
 
04:39:24.769 --> 04:39:24.779 align:start position:0%
questions and then what can we come up
 
04:39:27.410 --> 04:39:27.420 align:start position:0%
with as guidance that will help people
 
04:39:30.230 --> 04:39:30.240 align:start position:0%
make good decisions they may not choose
 
04:39:32.570 --> 04:39:32.580 align:start position:0%
to listen to it but there's an option
 
04:39:34.490 --> 04:39:34.500 align:start position:0%
that a group of smart people got
 
04:39:36.650 --> 04:39:36.660 align:start position:0%
together had really smart people testify
 
04:39:37.850 --> 04:39:37.860 align:start position:0%
about it and came up with
 
04:39:37.860 --> 04:39:40.610 align:start position:0%
about it and came up with
recommendations

04:39:40.610 --> 04:39:40.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:42.230 --> 04:39:42.240 align:start position:0%
any further questions from the committee
 
04:39:44.510 --> 04:39:44.520 align:start position:0%
representative bayu
 
04:39:45.948 --> 04:39:45.958 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
04:39:47.090 --> 04:39:47.100 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:39:47.100 --> 04:39:48.170 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

04:39:48.170 --> 04:39:48.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:39:49.970 --> 04:39:49.980 align:start position:0%
as this has been going along I've been
 
04:39:51.650 --> 04:39:51.660 align:start position:0%
coming up with questions in my head but
 
04:39:53.090 --> 04:39:53.100 align:start position:0%
I've been refraining from asking them
 
04:39:54.110 --> 04:39:54.120 align:start position:0%
because I'm
 
04:39:55.430 --> 04:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
these are the things that the committee
 
04:39:56.990 --> 04:39:57.000 align:start position:0%
would probably
 
04:39:57.000 --> 04:39:58.550 align:start position:0%
would probably
answer

04:39:58.550 --> 04:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
answer
 
04:40:00.470 --> 04:40:00.480 align:start position:0%
um is is your one of your ideas you know
 
04:40:02.570 --> 04:40:02.580 align:start position:0%
as a landlord myself I'm thinking this
 
04:40:04.610 --> 04:40:04.620 align:start position:0%
could be a good way of helping me Laura
 
04:40:07.368 --> 04:40:07.378 align:start position:0%
and better tenants uh who might stay
 
04:40:09.350 --> 04:40:09.360 align:start position:0%
longer and appreciate what they have
 
04:40:09.360 --> 04:40:10.910 align:start position:0%
longer and appreciate what they have
more

04:40:10.910 --> 04:40:10.920 align:start position:0%
more
 
04:40:13.490 --> 04:40:13.500 align:start position:0%
um so but I'm like what kind of
 
04:40:15.110 --> 04:40:15.120 align:start position:0%
infrastructure would I put in so do you
 
04:40:16.970 --> 04:40:16.980 align:start position:0%
envision this can it be like one part of
 
04:40:18.890 --> 04:40:18.900 align:start position:0%
it to be like an FAQ for
 
04:40:21.170 --> 04:40:21.180 align:start position:0%
landlords to say what what's available
 
04:40:23.330 --> 04:40:23.340 align:start position:0%
what answer their questions ahead of
 
04:40:25.430 --> 04:40:25.440 align:start position:0%
time can you know they might want like
 
04:40:26.630 --> 04:40:26.640 align:start position:0%
the idea of being able to upload back
 
04:40:28.250 --> 04:40:28.260 align:start position:0%
into the grid when the car is not in use
 
04:40:28.260 --> 04:40:29.510 align:start position:0%
into the grid when the car is not in use
and

04:40:29.510 --> 04:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:40:31.788 --> 04:40:31.798 align:start position:0%
you know reduce the
 
04:40:34.010 --> 04:40:34.020 align:start position:0%
electric bill or have that option build
 
04:40:35.390 --> 04:40:35.400 align:start position:0%
that into the infrastructure when they
 
04:40:37.190 --> 04:40:37.200 align:start position:0%
you know had electrical work done that
 
04:40:39.050 --> 04:40:39.060 align:start position:0%
kind of thing does that kind of fit your
 
04:40:39.060 --> 04:40:40.550 align:start position:0%
kind of thing does that kind of fit your
ideas

04:40:40.550 --> 04:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
ideas
 
04:40:42.170 --> 04:40:42.180 align:start position:0%
so one of the beautiful things about a
 
04:40:43.788 --> 04:40:43.798 align:start position:0%
study committee is that you really
 
04:40:45.470 --> 04:40:45.480 align:start position:0%
charge the study committee to come up
 
04:40:48.110 --> 04:40:48.120 align:start position:0%
with their series of questions their
 
04:40:50.090 --> 04:40:50.100 align:start position:0%
agenda who they're inviting to testify
 
04:40:52.610 --> 04:40:52.620 align:start position:0%
it's really open-ended which is great
 
04:40:55.490 --> 04:40:55.500 align:start position:0%
because a year like this an odd numbered
 
04:40:57.770 --> 04:40:57.780 align:start position:0%
year that's when you want to ask all
 
04:40:58.970 --> 04:40:58.980 align:start position:0%
those questions and get all those people
 
04:41:01.190 --> 04:41:01.200 align:start position:0%
together to put together a really good
 
04:41:03.590 --> 04:41:03.600 align:start position:0%
bill if you need one at the end of the
 
04:41:05.570 --> 04:41:05.580 align:start position:0%
study committee to go in the even
 
04:41:08.270 --> 04:41:08.280 align:start position:0%
numbered year so what you're describing
 
04:41:10.010 --> 04:41:10.020 align:start position:0%
in terms of inviting landlords to ask
 
04:41:12.050 --> 04:41:12.060 align:start position:0%
questions absolutely it's an opportunity
 
04:41:14.090 --> 04:41:14.100 align:start position:0%
for education for anyone who attends the
 
04:41:15.770 --> 04:41:15.780 align:start position:0%
study committee to learn about the right
 
04:41:17.810 --> 04:41:17.820 align:start position:0%
questions to ask and also best practices
 
04:41:19.788 --> 04:41:19.798 align:start position:0%
so you'll have some of these experts I
 
04:41:22.128 --> 04:41:22.138 align:start position:0%
imagine from UNH showing up and talking
 
04:41:23.930 --> 04:41:23.940 align:start position:0%
about future of the industry where we're
 
04:41:25.550 --> 04:41:25.560 align:start position:0%
headed what does that mean to be a good
 
04:41:27.530 --> 04:41:27.540 align:start position:0%
landlord and provide charging as a perk
 
04:41:29.090 --> 04:41:29.100 align:start position:0%
for tenants who might stay longer if you
 
04:41:31.070 --> 04:41:31.080 align:start position:0%
do that so I do think that that's a
 
04:41:34.070 --> 04:41:34.080 align:start position:0%
piece of it and um you know charging the
 
04:41:35.690 --> 04:41:35.700 align:start position:0%
committee with coming up with their own
 
04:41:37.610 --> 04:41:37.620 align:start position:0%
questions gives us great latitude to do
 
04:41:37.620 --> 04:41:39.948 align:start position:0%
questions gives us great latitude to do
that

04:41:39.948 --> 04:41:39.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:42.230 --> 04:41:42.240 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
04:41:44.330 --> 04:41:44.340 align:start position:0%
not seeing any thank you
 
04:41:47.330 --> 04:41:47.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:50.030 --> 04:41:50.040 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to recognize Lucius
 
04:41:53.208 --> 04:41:53.218 align:start position:0%
bar call Marshall partial who is in
 
04:41:54.530 --> 04:41:54.540 align:start position:0%
support of the bill and is requested
 
04:42:05.330 --> 04:42:05.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:08.448 --> 04:42:08.458 align:start position:0%
backwards thank you so much for the
 
04:42:11.690 --> 04:42:11.700 align:start position:0%
record Lucius partial eight and having
 
04:42:13.430 --> 04:42:13.440 align:start position:0%
driven a Nissan Leaf for a couple of
 
04:42:16.310 --> 04:42:16.320 align:start position:0%
years uh I want to say the first line of
 
04:42:18.110 --> 04:42:18.120 align:start position:0%
charging for me in fact most people is
 
04:42:19.730 --> 04:42:19.740 align:start position:0%
charging it at home
 
04:42:21.708 --> 04:42:21.718 align:start position:0%
uh you don't want to park your car
 
04:42:23.270 --> 04:42:23.280 align:start position:0%
downtown and walk
 
04:42:25.610 --> 04:42:25.620 align:start position:0%
a couple miles home you want it there
 
04:42:27.170 --> 04:42:27.180 align:start position:0%
when you need it
 
04:42:29.510 --> 04:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
um my Nissan Leaf there's a question
 
04:42:31.368 --> 04:42:31.378 align:start position:0%
about what kind of charging devices we
 
04:42:31.378 --> 04:42:32.390 align:start position:0%
about what kind of charging devices we
use

04:42:32.390 --> 04:42:32.400 align:start position:0%
use
 
04:42:34.730 --> 04:42:34.740 align:start position:0%
in my garage I have the same hookup that
 
04:42:36.470 --> 04:42:36.480 align:start position:0%
I have in my basement for my dryer a
 
04:42:39.230 --> 04:42:39.240 align:start position:0%
three prong it's either 1030p or 1430b
 
04:42:41.448 --> 04:42:41.458 align:start position:0%
the same things you have in your dryer
 
04:42:43.090 --> 04:42:43.100 align:start position:0%
and when you buy your electric vehicle
 
04:42:45.410 --> 04:42:45.420 align:start position:0%
usually comes with a cable that you plug
 
04:42:46.850 --> 04:42:46.860 align:start position:0%
right into there so there's no question
 
04:42:50.030 --> 04:42:50.040 align:start position:0%
there's no problems with you know
 
04:42:52.670 --> 04:42:52.680 align:start position:0%
with universality in that case
 
04:42:55.070 --> 04:42:55.080 align:start position:0%
and lastly I would just say that I think
 
04:42:57.650 --> 04:42:57.660 align:start position:0%
that this makes good sense because one
 
04:42:59.270 --> 04:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
of the things that we're all definitely
 
04:43:00.770 --> 04:43:00.780 align:start position:0%
aware of is the price of electricity
 
04:43:03.230 --> 04:43:03.240 align:start position:0%
right now and if we can flatten that
 
04:43:05.690 --> 04:43:05.700 align:start position:0%
curve as my as our former speaker said
 
04:43:08.090 --> 04:43:08.100 align:start position:0%
if we can flatten the curve of what we
 
04:43:11.150 --> 04:43:11.160 align:start position:0%
consume and uh most our consumption is
 
04:43:13.250 --> 04:43:13.260 align:start position:0%
around five o'clock we're not using the
 
04:43:14.510 --> 04:43:14.520 align:start position:0%
middle of the night if we can do that
 
04:43:16.850 --> 04:43:16.860 align:start position:0%
through these electric vehicles the end
 
04:43:18.470 --> 04:43:18.480 align:start position:0%
result has to be if we believe in the
 
04:43:19.788 --> 04:43:19.798 align:start position:0%
law of supply and demand on a free
 
04:43:22.610 --> 04:43:22.620 align:start position:0%
market then we would see a reduction in
 
04:43:24.948 --> 04:43:24.958 align:start position:0%
our electric costs so and three counts I
 
04:43:27.050 --> 04:43:27.060 align:start position:0%
fully support this bill
 
04:43:28.788 --> 04:43:28.798 align:start position:0%
and available for questions if you have
 
04:43:30.230 --> 04:43:30.240 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
 
04:43:30.240 --> 04:43:31.910 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
committee

04:43:31.910 --> 04:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:43:34.970 --> 04:43:34.980 align:start position:0%
not seeing any oh representative Sykes
 
04:43:34.980 --> 04:43:36.050 align:start position:0%
not seeing any oh representative Sykes
yeah

04:43:36.050 --> 04:43:36.060 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:43:36.060 --> 04:43:36.708 align:start position:0%
yeah
um

04:43:36.708 --> 04:43:36.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:43:38.570 --> 04:43:38.580 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
04:43:41.570 --> 04:43:41.580 align:start position:0%
so is it correct that at the present
 
04:43:43.128 --> 04:43:43.138 align:start position:0%
time other than the New Hampshire
 
04:43:43.138 --> 04:43:44.990 align:start position:0%
time other than the New Hampshire
cooperative

04:43:44.990 --> 04:43:45.000 align:start position:0%
cooperative
 
04:43:48.170 --> 04:43:48.180 align:start position:0%
that except for very specific programs
 
04:43:50.990 --> 04:43:51.000 align:start position:0%
most of the electric electric supply
 
04:43:55.670 --> 04:43:55.680 align:start position:0%
companies do not have time to use rates
 
04:43:58.610 --> 04:43:58.620 align:start position:0%
that is true that would require uh smart
 
04:44:00.050 --> 04:44:00.060 align:start position:0%
meters and most of our electric
 
04:44:01.368 --> 04:44:01.378 align:start position:0%
companies would have installed smart
 
04:44:03.770 --> 04:44:03.780 align:start position:0%
meters I do know there's a bill coming
 
04:44:05.570 --> 04:44:05.580 align:start position:0%
forward to install
 
04:44:07.430 --> 04:44:07.440 align:start position:0%
for consumers to be able to install
 
04:44:10.670 --> 04:44:10.680 align:start position:0%
Smart Meters at their own cost and
 
04:44:12.170 --> 04:44:12.180 align:start position:0%
they're relatively inexpensive just a
 
04:44:12.180 --> 04:44:13.368 align:start position:0%
they're relatively inexpensive just a
follow-up

04:44:13.368 --> 04:44:13.378 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
04:44:16.128 --> 04:44:16.138 align:start position:0%
follow-up so my presumption is that
 
04:44:18.110 --> 04:44:18.120 align:start position:0%
again we're just talking about a study
 
04:44:19.910 --> 04:44:19.920 align:start position:0%
committee here so this is one of the
 
04:44:21.590 --> 04:44:21.600 align:start position:0%
topics that a study committee could look
 
04:44:23.930 --> 04:44:23.940 align:start position:0%
into as well yes it could be and it
 
04:44:25.910 --> 04:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
would also depend upon whether or not
 
04:44:29.150 --> 04:44:29.160 align:start position:0%
you have a utilities provided or whether
 
04:44:31.550 --> 04:44:31.560 align:start position:0%
or not each apartment is metered on
 
04:44:34.430 --> 04:44:34.440 align:start position:0%
their own so
 
04:44:37.070 --> 04:44:37.080 align:start position:0%
any further questions from the committee
 
04:44:40.970 --> 04:44:40.980 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:43.430 --> 04:44:43.440 align:start position:0%
chair now recognizes uh Chris Scotland
 
04:44:45.948 --> 04:44:45.958 align:start position:0%
who has requested three minutes he has
 
04:45:07.368 --> 04:45:07.378 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:09.530 --> 04:45:09.540 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman Walsh and members of
 
04:45:11.090 --> 04:45:11.100 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is Chris goglin
 
04:45:12.830 --> 04:45:12.840 align:start position:0%
I'm the director of energy transition
 
04:45:15.050 --> 04:45:15.060 align:start position:0%
with clean energy New Hampshire we're a
 
04:45:17.750 --> 04:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
non-profit organization with over 130
 
04:45:19.730 --> 04:45:19.740 align:start position:0%
business members and 34 Municipal
 
04:45:22.128 --> 04:45:22.138 align:start position:0%
members representing almost 300 000 New
 
04:45:24.530 --> 04:45:24.540 align:start position:0%
Hampshire citizens with hundreds of
 
04:45:27.350 --> 04:45:27.360 align:start position:0%
additional individual residents that are
 
04:45:28.850 --> 04:45:28.860 align:start position:0%
members of our
 
04:45:31.910 --> 04:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
organization we advance the or we
 
04:45:33.288 --> 04:45:33.298 align:start position:0%
advocate for the adoption of clean
 
04:45:35.448 --> 04:45:35.458 align:start position:0%
energy initiatives through a nonpartisan
 
04:45:37.910 --> 04:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
fact-based lens and we are host to the
 
04:45:39.410 --> 04:45:39.420 align:start position:0%
drive Electric New Hampshire Coalition
 
04:45:40.970 --> 04:45:40.980 align:start position:0%
which was formed to support electric
 
04:45:44.150 --> 04:45:44.160 align:start position:0%
vehicle adoption across the state
 
04:45:47.030 --> 04:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire sorry I worked for the
 
04:45:48.530 --> 04:45:48.540 align:start position:0%
state for 15 years it's going to be a
 
04:45:50.330 --> 04:45:50.340 align:start position:0%
hard habit to get rid of
 
04:45:52.250 --> 04:45:52.260 align:start position:0%
sorry Becky
 
04:45:54.288 --> 04:45:54.298 align:start position:0%
um clean energy New Hampshire takes no
 
04:45:55.910 --> 04:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
position on the bill as written but
 
04:45:57.650 --> 04:45:57.660 align:start position:0%
offers the following information for
 
04:45:57.660 --> 04:45:59.150 align:start position:0%
offers the following information for
consideration

04:45:59.150 --> 04:45:59.160 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
04:46:01.970 --> 04:46:01.980 align:start position:0%
EVS are more energy and cost efficient
 
04:46:01.980 --> 04:46:03.110 align:start position:0%
EVS are more energy and cost efficient
technology

04:46:03.110 --> 04:46:03.120 align:start position:0%
technology
 
04:46:05.448 --> 04:46:05.458 align:start position:0%
they convert 77 percent of the
 
04:46:07.310 --> 04:46:07.320 align:start position:0%
electrical and energy they take back
 
04:46:09.890 --> 04:46:09.900 align:start position:0%
from the grid into moving the car or
 
04:46:11.810 --> 04:46:11.820 align:start position:0%
vehicle forward where a conventional gas
 
04:46:14.868 --> 04:46:14.878 align:start position:0%
and diesel engine only converts 17 to 30
 
04:46:17.090 --> 04:46:17.100 align:start position:0%
percent of the energy stored
 
04:46:19.010 --> 04:46:19.020 align:start position:0%
to move the vehicle the rest is wasted
 
04:46:21.288 --> 04:46:21.298 align:start position:0%
as heat this represents a significant
 
04:46:24.650 --> 04:46:24.660 align:start position:0%
cost savings to EV owners EVS are
 
04:46:26.150 --> 04:46:26.160 align:start position:0%
currently a small fraction of the
 
04:46:27.708 --> 04:46:27.718 align:start position:0%
current vehicle Fleet but that is fast
 
04:46:29.930 --> 04:46:29.940 align:start position:0%
changing in the next decade it is
 
04:46:31.730 --> 04:46:31.740 align:start position:0%
expected that EVS on the New England
 
04:46:34.310 --> 04:46:34.320 align:start position:0%
roads will increase by over 30 times
 
04:46:37.190 --> 04:46:37.200 align:start position:0%
their current values from 50 000 across
 
04:46:38.750 --> 04:46:38.760 align:start position:0%
all of New England to more than 1.5
 
04:46:40.910 --> 04:46:40.920 align:start position:0%
million vehicles
 
04:46:43.250 --> 04:46:43.260 align:start position:0%
this comes as the price for EVS Falls
 
04:46:46.128 --> 04:46:46.138 align:start position:0%
but also as more and more auto
 
04:46:47.628 --> 04:46:47.638 align:start position:0%
manufacturers switch over their
 
04:46:50.510 --> 04:46:50.520 align:start position:0%
platforms to all electric
 
04:46:53.030 --> 04:46:53.040 align:start position:0%
the cost for EVS are falling will soon
 
04:46:55.670 --> 04:46:55.680 align:start position:0%
compete with that of gas and electric or
 
04:46:57.410 --> 04:46:57.420 align:start position:0%
will compete with out of gas and diesel
 
04:47:01.010 --> 04:47:01.020 align:start position:0%
vehicles it's forecasted by 2024 to 2025
 
04:47:03.590 --> 04:47:03.600 align:start position:0%
EV prices will reach parity with
 
04:47:05.750 --> 04:47:05.760 align:start position:0%
existing gas and diesel vehicles meaning
 
04:47:08.570 --> 04:47:08.580 align:start position:0%
the price that you are shopping for will
 
04:47:10.128 --> 04:47:10.138 align:start position:0%
be the same regardless of what platform
 
04:47:13.208 --> 04:47:13.218 align:start position:0%
you are looking at this will increase
 
04:47:17.030 --> 04:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
as the supply chains improve across the
 
04:47:18.530 --> 04:47:18.540 align:start position:0%
entire economy
 
04:47:20.810 --> 04:47:20.820 align:start position:0%
currently most EV charging by New
 
04:47:23.030 --> 04:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents is done at home but
 
04:47:25.310 --> 04:47:25.320 align:start position:0%
not all residents are suitable suitable
 
04:47:27.410 --> 04:47:27.420 align:start position:0%
and that's one thing that a study
 
04:47:29.628 --> 04:47:29.638 align:start position:0%
commission may wish to consider this may
 
04:47:31.670 --> 04:47:31.680 align:start position:0%
not just be about renters in my
 
04:47:34.730 --> 04:47:34.740 align:start position:0%
neighborhood there are three uh
 
04:47:36.830 --> 04:47:36.840 align:start position:0%
communities where there are manufactured
 
04:47:39.230 --> 04:47:39.240 align:start position:0%
homes they may have smaller panels where
 
04:47:42.708 --> 04:47:42.718 align:start position:0%
they cannot host the 240 volt circuit
 
04:47:44.868 --> 04:47:44.878 align:start position:0%
that is required for a level two
 
04:47:46.550 --> 04:47:46.560 align:start position:0%
charging at the house
 
04:47:48.590 --> 04:47:48.600 align:start position:0%
for my house I have an EV I charge it
 
04:47:50.270 --> 04:47:50.280 align:start position:0%
for midnight to 8 A.M because I'm a good
 
04:47:52.310 --> 04:47:52.320 align:start position:0%
guy eventually there will be time of use
 
04:47:54.770 --> 04:47:54.780 align:start position:0%
rates in fact to answer a previous
 
04:47:56.868 --> 04:47:56.878 align:start position:0%
question not only does the New Hampshire
 
04:47:58.788 --> 04:47:58.798 align:start position:0%
Electric Co-op have time of use rates
 
04:48:00.910 --> 04:48:00.920 align:start position:0%
but Liberty and Unitil have theirs
 
04:48:03.830 --> 04:48:03.840 align:start position:0%
approved by the puc and are rolling them
 
04:48:06.288 --> 04:48:06.298 align:start position:0%
out eversource is in the process of
 
04:48:08.990 --> 04:48:09.000 align:start position:0%
having theirs filed and approved
 
04:48:11.510 --> 04:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
I'm an eversource customer I don't have
 
04:48:13.030 --> 04:48:13.040 align:start position:0%
it yet available
 
04:48:16.310 --> 04:48:16.320 align:start position:0%
but I was able to install My Level 2
 
04:48:18.470 --> 04:48:18.480 align:start position:0%
charger and
 
04:48:20.330 --> 04:48:20.340 align:start position:0%
um so it's something that as the
 
04:48:21.770 --> 04:48:21.780 align:start position:0%
previous uh speaker representative
 
04:48:23.570 --> 04:48:23.580 align:start position:0%
partial noted it's simply a dryer plug
 
04:48:25.368 --> 04:48:25.378 align:start position:0%
that we plug into
 
04:48:27.830 --> 04:48:27.840 align:start position:0%
but with some panels they may not be
 
04:48:30.170 --> 04:48:30.180 align:start position:0%
able to install this technology or host
 
04:48:32.390 --> 04:48:32.400 align:start position:0%
this technology and so it's a question
 
04:48:35.208 --> 04:48:35.218 align:start position:0%
of how do we make this electric vehicles
 
04:48:37.010 --> 04:48:37.020 align:start position:0%
as they fall in price and as used
 
04:48:40.490 --> 04:48:40.500 align:start position:0%
vehicle EV Market matures I was actually
 
04:48:42.890 --> 04:48:42.900 align:start position:0%
able to buy a used EV how do we make it
 
04:48:44.868 --> 04:48:44.878 align:start position:0%
so that any
 
04:48:47.030 --> 04:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
resident of New Hampshire is able to
 
04:48:51.650 --> 04:48:51.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:54.350 --> 04:48:54.360 align:start position:0%
and I will pause there
 
04:48:56.750 --> 04:48:56.760 align:start position:0%
and take any questions you might have
 
04:48:58.250 --> 04:48:58.260 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
 
04:48:58.260 --> 04:49:00.350 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
committee

04:49:00.350 --> 04:49:00.360 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:49:04.788 --> 04:49:04.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:07.850 --> 04:49:07.860 align:start position:0%
chair now recognizes Nick Norman
 
04:49:10.070 --> 04:49:10.080 align:start position:0%
who opposes the bill also has some
 
04:49:13.128 --> 04:49:13.138 align:start position:0%
written testimony and he represents the
 
04:49:28.970 --> 04:49:28.980 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:31.910 --> 04:49:31.920 align:start position:0%
off yeah I appreciate the opportunity to
 
04:49:33.530 --> 04:49:33.540 align:start position:0%
speak to you thank you very much my name
 
04:49:34.970 --> 04:49:34.980 align:start position:0%
is Nick Norman
 
04:49:36.650 --> 04:49:36.660 align:start position:0%
I do represent the department
 
04:49:38.868 --> 04:49:38.878 align:start position:0%
Association of New Hampshire and the
 
04:49:41.030 --> 04:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
landlord tenant law legislative
 
04:49:41.040 --> 04:49:42.530 align:start position:0%
landlord tenant law legislative
initiative

04:49:42.530 --> 04:49:42.540 align:start position:0%
initiative
 
04:49:44.270 --> 04:49:44.280 align:start position:0%
on the government Affairs chair for the
 
04:49:45.970 --> 04:49:45.980 align:start position:0%
apartment association of New Hampshire
 
04:49:50.810 --> 04:49:50.820 align:start position:0%
we have an Outreach of about 3 500
 
04:49:52.788 --> 04:49:52.798 align:start position:0%
people on our email list that we
 
04:49:55.670 --> 04:49:55.680 align:start position:0%
communicate to weekly in the landlord
 
04:49:57.350 --> 04:49:57.360 align:start position:0%
community of landlords across New
 
04:49:57.360 --> 04:49:58.730 align:start position:0%
community of landlords across New
Hampshire

04:49:58.730 --> 04:49:58.740 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
04:50:01.570 --> 04:50:01.580 align:start position:0%
so there's a few things that jump out
 
04:50:03.670 --> 04:50:03.680 align:start position:0%
immediately as
 
04:50:07.970 --> 04:50:07.980 align:start position:0%
complications with the idea I'm not
 
04:50:09.590 --> 04:50:09.600 align:start position:0%
opposed to the idea of providing
 
04:50:09.600 --> 04:50:11.090 align:start position:0%
opposed to the idea of providing
Chargers

04:50:11.090 --> 04:50:11.100 align:start position:0%
Chargers
 
04:50:15.470 --> 04:50:15.480 align:start position:0%
to I to tenants I have a Prius myself
 
04:50:17.690 --> 04:50:17.700 align:start position:0%
been a Prius owner for years I like
 
04:50:19.970 --> 04:50:19.980 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles
 
04:50:22.730 --> 04:50:22.740 align:start position:0%
but I hope that there's no thought that
 
04:50:24.670 --> 04:50:24.680 align:start position:0%
there would be some kind of a mandate
 
04:50:27.970 --> 04:50:27.980 align:start position:0%
that property owners have to provide
 
04:50:31.190 --> 04:50:31.200 align:start position:0%
electrical vehicle charging stations
 
04:50:33.110 --> 04:50:33.120 align:start position:0%
there could be all kind of complications
 
04:50:33.120 --> 04:50:36.470 align:start position:0%
there could be all kind of complications
complications

04:50:36.470 --> 04:50:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:36.480 --> 04:50:38.930 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:50:38.930 --> 04:50:38.940 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:41.990 --> 04:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
and I notice in the way this bill is
 
04:50:43.910 --> 04:50:43.920 align:start position:0%
written that there is nothing that
 
04:50:46.490 --> 04:50:46.500 align:start position:0%
mandates the requirement to talk to the
 
04:50:48.410 --> 04:50:48.420 align:start position:0%
stakeholders I've heard a lot of talk
 
04:50:50.270 --> 04:50:50.280 align:start position:0%
about talking to stakeholders but there
 
04:50:51.948 --> 04:50:51.958 align:start position:0%
is nothing in this bill that mandates
 
04:50:53.570 --> 04:50:53.580 align:start position:0%
that at all
 
04:50:56.510 --> 04:50:56.520 align:start position:0%
and in our experience we've often seen
 
04:50:59.448 --> 04:50:59.458 align:start position:0%
commissions and committees come up with
 
04:51:01.730 --> 04:51:01.740 align:start position:0%
things that end up with mandates on
 
04:51:03.470 --> 04:51:03.480 align:start position:0%
property owners that become very
 
04:51:03.480 --> 04:51:04.730 align:start position:0%
property owners that become very
expensive

04:51:04.730 --> 04:51:04.740 align:start position:0%
expensive
 
04:51:06.650 --> 04:51:06.660 align:start position:0%
and then all of that gets transferred
 
04:51:09.830 --> 04:51:09.840 align:start position:0%
into increased rents and in our Market
 
04:51:13.850 --> 04:51:13.860 align:start position:0%
the idea of forcing for further rent
 
04:51:17.448 --> 04:51:17.458 align:start position:0%
increases is just unfathomable
 
04:51:20.570 --> 04:51:20.580 align:start position:0%
so let's think about this for a second
 
04:51:23.628 --> 04:51:23.638 align:start position:0%
the installation cost could be expensive
 
04:51:25.970 --> 04:51:25.980 align:start position:0%
do we have to put in new electric meters
 
04:51:27.890 --> 04:51:27.900 align:start position:0%
is the electric service in that
 
04:51:30.590 --> 04:51:30.600 align:start position:0%
apartment in all apartments you know
 
04:51:32.930 --> 04:51:32.940 align:start position:0%
we're sufficient
 
04:51:35.868 --> 04:51:35.878 align:start position:0%
if we're going to make a station from a
 
04:51:40.368 --> 04:51:40.378 align:start position:0%
building out to the parking lot so now
 
04:51:42.410 --> 04:51:42.420 align:start position:0%
we have to dig up the ground and install
 
04:51:44.750 --> 04:51:44.760 align:start position:0%
an underground cable are we digging up a
 
04:51:46.610 --> 04:51:46.620 align:start position:0%
parking lot
 
04:51:49.190 --> 04:51:49.200 align:start position:0%
to put in a charging station
 
04:51:51.470 --> 04:51:51.480 align:start position:0%
or are we just going to end up with a
 
04:51:53.510 --> 04:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
hundred cables across the parking lot in
 
04:51:54.948 --> 04:51:54.958 align:start position:0%
a tripping hazard
 
04:51:57.110 --> 04:51:57.120 align:start position:0%
is the state going to now release this
 
04:51:59.628 --> 04:51:59.638 align:start position:0%
from liability of tripping hazards from
 
04:52:05.990 --> 04:52:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:06.000 --> 04:52:08.868 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:52:08.868 --> 04:52:08.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:12.650 --> 04:52:12.660 align:start position:0%
many landlords don't have any tenants
 
04:52:14.868 --> 04:52:14.878 align:start position:0%
that have electrical vehicles in some
 
04:52:16.550 --> 04:52:16.560 align:start position:0%
parts of the country particularly maybe
 
04:52:19.250 --> 04:52:19.260 align:start position:0%
up in the north where it's it's colder
 
04:52:21.650 --> 04:52:21.660 align:start position:0%
and it is more
 
04:52:23.448 --> 04:52:23.458 align:start position:0%
you know in the mountains it doesn't
 
04:52:24.890 --> 04:52:24.900 align:start position:0%
make might not make sense to have
 
04:52:27.410 --> 04:52:27.420 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles so again I hope that
 
04:52:30.170 --> 04:52:30.180 align:start position:0%
there's no mandate on across the board
 
04:52:33.890 --> 04:52:33.900 align:start position:0%
one one size fits all
 
04:52:38.150 --> 04:52:38.160 align:start position:0%
there's supply issues with new panels
 
04:52:40.730 --> 04:52:40.740 align:start position:0%
there are Parts issues in this market
 
04:52:42.650 --> 04:52:42.660 align:start position:0%
that are making the supply chain of
 
04:52:44.868 --> 04:52:44.878 align:start position:0%
getting new electric meter boxes almost
 
04:52:46.550 --> 04:52:46.560 align:start position:0%
impossible to
 
04:52:50.930 --> 04:52:50.940 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:55.070 --> 04:52:55.080 align:start position:0%
so there's there's many many issues with
 
04:52:58.970 --> 04:52:58.980 align:start position:0%
this and you know who pays for it
 
04:53:02.150 --> 04:53:02.160 align:start position:0%
who pays for all this cost
 
04:53:04.490 --> 04:53:04.500 align:start position:0%
could then we open up a situation that
 
04:53:06.470 --> 04:53:06.480 align:start position:0%
we've made something so convenient that
 
04:53:09.170 --> 04:53:09.180 align:start position:0%
other people could run up and charge
 
04:53:12.708 --> 04:53:12.718 align:start position:0%
their vehicle on someone else's station
 
04:53:15.230 --> 04:53:15.240 align:start position:0%
now someone's stealing electricity
 
04:53:17.570 --> 04:53:17.580 align:start position:0%
you know how do we handle that
 
04:53:19.250 --> 04:53:19.260 align:start position:0%
I think there's a lot of questions here
 
04:53:21.050 --> 04:53:21.060 align:start position:0%
that makes it
 
04:53:23.208 --> 04:53:23.218 align:start position:0%
unreasonable to think that we're going
 
04:53:26.390 --> 04:53:26.400 align:start position:0%
to force Property Owners to be putting
 
04:53:28.670 --> 04:53:28.680 align:start position:0%
in stations across the board in a one
 
04:53:31.310 --> 04:53:31.320 align:start position:0%
size fits all
 
04:53:31.320 --> 04:53:32.690 align:start position:0%
size fits all
so

04:53:32.690 --> 04:53:32.700 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:53:34.788 --> 04:53:34.798 align:start position:0%
probably could talk more but I'll be
 
04:53:37.490 --> 04:53:37.500 align:start position:0%
happy to answer questions
 
04:53:39.708 --> 04:53:39.718 align:start position:0%
and that that's our main concerns is
 
04:53:41.930 --> 04:53:41.940 align:start position:0%
totally not thought out at all and I
 
04:53:43.490 --> 04:53:43.500 align:start position:0%
think that you'll find that there's a
 
04:53:46.490 --> 04:53:46.500 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount of issues to be
 
04:53:49.250 --> 04:53:49.260 align:start position:0%
thought out and all of it can be done on
 
04:53:51.650 --> 04:53:51.660 align:start position:0%
a one by one case by the landlord
 
04:53:53.448 --> 04:53:53.458 align:start position:0%
talking with tenant and working out
 
04:53:56.030 --> 04:53:56.040 align:start position:0%
their own special situation and I agree
 
04:53:57.890 --> 04:53:57.900 align:start position:0%
with what was said over here the
 
04:54:00.230 --> 04:54:00.240 align:start position:0%
Market's going to take care of this
 
04:54:02.208 --> 04:54:02.218 align:start position:0%
because people are going to want more
 
04:54:05.030 --> 04:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
and more to have an option and a
 
04:54:06.830 --> 04:54:06.840 align:start position:0%
landlord will want to provide that
 
04:54:06.840 --> 04:54:08.330 align:start position:0%
landlord will want to provide that
option

04:54:08.330 --> 04:54:08.340 align:start position:0%
option
 
04:54:11.750 --> 04:54:11.760 align:start position:0%
to make their parking apartment more
 
04:54:11.760 --> 04:54:13.670 align:start position:0%
to make their parking apartment more
rentable

04:54:13.670 --> 04:54:13.680 align:start position:0%
rentable
 
04:54:15.948 --> 04:54:15.958 align:start position:0%
but to have an idea that there's going
 
04:54:18.170 --> 04:54:18.180 align:start position:0%
to be some kind of a mandate there's
 
04:54:20.810 --> 04:54:20.820 align:start position:0%
going to be one size fits all
 
04:54:23.628 --> 04:54:23.638 align:start position:0%
and increase all of the rent costs I
 
04:54:26.810 --> 04:54:26.820 align:start position:0%
think is unreasonable so I I would
 
04:54:30.830 --> 04:54:30.840 align:start position:0%
prefer not to have the committee at all
 
04:54:33.708 --> 04:54:33.718 align:start position:0%
it's we appreciate your Insight and um
 
04:54:35.990 --> 04:54:36.000 align:start position:0%
however this bill is just about creating
 
04:54:38.390 --> 04:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
the committee I understand and a lot of
 
04:54:40.850 --> 04:54:40.860 align:start position:0%
the a lot of the topics you brought up
 
04:54:40.860 --> 04:54:41.628 align:start position:0%
the a lot of the topics you brought up
here

04:54:41.628 --> 04:54:41.638 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:54:44.990 --> 04:54:45.000 align:start position:0%
is really jumping really ahead this bill
 
04:54:46.490 --> 04:54:46.500 align:start position:0%
is just really about secreting a
 
04:54:46.500 --> 04:54:48.230 align:start position:0%
is just really about secreting a
committee

04:54:48.230 --> 04:54:48.240 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:54:51.708 --> 04:54:51.718 align:start position:0%
so any any questions from
 
04:54:53.750 --> 04:54:53.760 align:start position:0%
representative sellers thank you Mr
 
04:54:53.760 --> 04:54:54.590 align:start position:0%
representative sellers thank you Mr
chair

04:54:54.590 --> 04:54:54.600 align:start position:0%
chair
 
04:54:57.890 --> 04:54:57.900 align:start position:0%
thank you if you had landlords and
 
04:54:59.810 --> 04:54:59.820 align:start position:0%
Property Owners on this committee if it
 
04:55:01.430 --> 04:55:01.440 align:start position:0%
was even possible
 
04:55:03.470 --> 04:55:03.480 align:start position:0%
how many would you want Helen there
 
04:55:04.910 --> 04:55:04.920 align:start position:0%
well I'd like it how would they be
 
04:55:04.920 --> 04:55:05.990 align:start position:0%
well I'd like it how would they be
chosen

04:55:05.990 --> 04:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
chosen
 
04:55:08.090 --> 04:55:08.100 align:start position:0%
well the apartment association of New
 
04:55:09.590 --> 04:55:09.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire could help you choose
 
04:55:12.128 --> 04:55:12.138 align:start position:0%
landlords but I think you should have
 
04:55:14.690 --> 04:55:14.700 align:start position:0%
landlords that have a large number of
 
04:55:17.448 --> 04:55:17.458 align:start position:0%
units like the hundreds complexes that
 
04:55:19.128 --> 04:55:19.138 align:start position:0%
you've heard talk about and I think
 
04:55:21.230 --> 04:55:21.240 align:start position:0%
should have some landlords that are in
 
04:55:22.250 --> 04:55:22.260 align:start position:0%
the middle
 
04:55:26.208 --> 04:55:26.218 align:start position:0%
maybe 30 to 50 units and you should have
 
04:55:28.670 --> 04:55:28.680 align:start position:0%
some small landlords on the committee
 
04:55:30.890 --> 04:55:30.900 align:start position:0%
and the committee should have some form
 
04:55:32.510 --> 04:55:32.520 align:start position:0%
of balance
 
04:55:35.448 --> 04:55:35.458 align:start position:0%
what we've seen historically is
 
04:55:38.030 --> 04:55:38.040 align:start position:0%
committees are created with a
 
04:55:40.788 --> 04:55:40.798 align:start position:0%
preponderance of tenant advocates
 
04:55:43.010 --> 04:55:43.020 align:start position:0%
and very little landlord representation
 
04:55:43.020 --> 04:55:46.910 align:start position:0%
and very little landlord representation
representation

04:55:46.910 --> 04:55:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:49.850 --> 04:55:49.860 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
04:55:53.510 --> 04:55:53.520 align:start position:0%
not seeing any thank you thank you
 
04:55:56.030 --> 04:55:56.040 align:start position:0%
that is the last of the pink cards
 
04:55:57.230 --> 04:55:57.240 align:start position:0%
um is there anybody else who would like
 
04:56:00.350 --> 04:56:00.360 align:start position:0%
to speak on HP 111
 
04:56:02.090 --> 04:56:02.100 align:start position:0%
not seeing any I'm going to close the
 
04:56:05.150 --> 04:56:05.160 align:start position:0%
hearing on hb11
 
04:56:08.510 --> 04:56:08.520 align:start position:0%
our next bill is hb132 we'll pick up in
 
05:01:49.390 --> 05:01:49.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:52.310 --> 05:01:52.320 align:start position:0%
okay being 229 I'm going to open up the
 
05:01:56.208 --> 05:01:56.218 align:start position:0%
public hearing on House Bill 132.
 
05:02:00.010 --> 05:02:00.020 align:start position:0%
and I guess the prime sponsor
 
05:02:02.590 --> 05:02:02.600 align:start position:0%
representative Newman
 
05:02:04.970 --> 05:02:04.980 align:start position:0%
and Ray Newman you're going to open this
 
05:02:06.590 --> 05:02:06.600 align:start position:0%
up together okay
 
05:02:10.368 --> 05:02:10.378 align:start position:0%
floor is yours welcome thank you good
 
05:02:13.490 --> 05:02:13.500 align:start position:0%
afternoon everyone on this committee my
 
05:02:16.910 --> 05:02:16.920 align:start position:0%
name is Sue Newman I'm represent Nashua
 
05:02:18.770 --> 05:02:18.780 align:start position:0%

and I serve on the public works and
 
05:02:25.128 --> 05:02:25.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:27.230 --> 05:02:27.240 align:start position:0%
and I'm Ray Newman I'm also a
 
05:02:28.910 --> 05:02:28.920 align:start position:0%
representative I'm on the Public Works
 
05:02:28.920 --> 05:02:30.288 align:start position:0%
representative I'm on the Public Works
committee

05:02:30.288 --> 05:02:30.298 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:02:32.270 --> 05:02:32.280 align:start position:0%
not Public Works my wife is on the
 
05:02:33.770 --> 05:02:33.780 align:start position:0%
Public Works community
 
05:02:35.628 --> 05:02:35.638 align:start position:0%
I'm on criminal justice it's a little
 
05:02:36.708 --> 05:02:36.718 align:start position:0%
bit more
 
05:02:36.718 --> 05:02:40.610 align:start position:0%
bit more
interesting

05:02:40.610 --> 05:02:40.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:40.620 --> 05:02:41.868 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:02:41.868 --> 05:02:41.878 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:02:45.708 --> 05:02:45.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:47.990 --> 05:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
I hope there's no comments we know we
 
05:02:50.208 --> 05:02:50.218 align:start position:0%
really know where we go up here
 
05:02:53.208 --> 05:02:53.218 align:start position:0%
um all right house bill 132 relative to
 
05:02:55.610 --> 05:02:55.620 align:start position:0%
a tire disclosure
 
05:02:58.190 --> 05:02:58.200 align:start position:0%
generally there's a little history about
 
05:03:01.250 --> 05:03:01.260 align:start position:0%
pre-owned trailers to pass along to a
 
05:03:01.260 --> 05:03:02.330 align:start position:0%
pre-owned trailers to pass along to a
buyer

05:03:02.330 --> 05:03:02.340 align:start position:0%
buyer
 
05:03:05.628 --> 05:03:05.638 align:start position:0%
a trailer's Tire age though is something
 
05:03:08.150 --> 05:03:08.160 align:start position:0%
that is available and really should be
 
05:03:10.788 --> 05:03:10.798 align:start position:0%
passed along to buyers as they consider
 
05:03:12.350 --> 05:03:12.360 align:start position:0%
a purchase
 
05:03:15.288 --> 05:03:15.298 align:start position:0%
the older a trailer's tires are the
 
05:03:18.350 --> 05:03:18.360 align:start position:0%
higher the risk is for a blowout and or
 
05:03:21.350 --> 05:03:21.360 align:start position:0%
a deadly accident
 
05:03:23.690 --> 05:03:23.700 align:start position:0%
for background the origin of this bill
 
05:03:27.770 --> 05:03:27.780 align:start position:0%
began November 21st 21 in Troutville
 
05:03:30.830 --> 05:03:30.840 align:start position:0%
Virginia which is about 700 miles from
 
05:03:34.610 --> 05:03:34.620 align:start position:0%
Nashua maybe some of you have been there
 
05:03:37.490 --> 05:03:37.500 align:start position:0%
no all right well
 
05:03:40.490 --> 05:03:40.500 align:start position:0%
we hadn't either until this time we had
 
05:03:43.368 --> 05:03:43.378 align:start position:0%
left the previous day from Nashua to
 
05:03:45.890 --> 05:03:45.900 align:start position:0%
visit our children and grandchildren in
 
05:03:48.170 --> 05:03:48.180 align:start position:0%
North Carolina in Florida over that
 
05:03:48.180 --> 05:03:49.730 align:start position:0%
North Carolina in Florida over that
Thanksgiving

05:03:49.730 --> 05:03:49.740 align:start position:0%
Thanksgiving
 
05:03:52.510 --> 05:03:52.520 align:start position:0%
and the week before that November 15
 
05:03:57.230 --> 05:03:57.240 align:start position:0%
2021 our new to us used and dealer
 
05:03:59.570 --> 05:03:59.580 align:start position:0%
inspected travel trailer was made
 
05:04:02.930 --> 05:04:02.940 align:start position:0%
available for us to begin travel with
 
05:04:05.448 --> 05:04:05.458 align:start position:0%
so going back to Troutville
 
05:04:07.730 --> 05:04:07.740 align:start position:0%
while we were peacefully and very
 
05:04:10.390 --> 05:04:10.400 align:start position:0%
moderately driving along on Interstate
 
05:04:14.448 --> 05:04:14.458 align:start position:0%
81 South late in the day on that Sunday
 
05:04:16.368 --> 05:04:16.378 align:start position:0%
in November
 
05:04:19.010 --> 05:04:19.020 align:start position:0%
we were alerted by a passing motorist
 
05:04:21.470 --> 05:04:21.480 align:start position:0%
that something was going on with our
 
05:04:21.480 --> 05:04:22.730 align:start position:0%
that something was going on with our
trailer

05:04:22.730 --> 05:04:22.740 align:start position:0%
trailer
 
05:04:25.550 --> 05:04:25.560 align:start position:0%
we pulled over we were fortunate to be
 
05:04:27.948 --> 05:04:27.958 align:start position:0%
on the right hand side of the road and
 
05:04:30.530 --> 05:04:30.540 align:start position:0%
could get off to the shoulder and we saw
 
05:04:33.110 --> 05:04:33.120 align:start position:0%
that one of our trailer's tires was
 
05:04:34.430 --> 05:04:34.440 align:start position:0%
coming apart
 
05:04:37.190 --> 05:04:37.200 align:start position:0%
the tread had separated from the trayer
 
05:04:40.610 --> 05:04:40.620 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry the tire and was flapping
 
05:04:43.610 --> 05:04:43.620 align:start position:0%
steel belts had snapped and were poking
 
05:04:45.770 --> 05:04:45.780 align:start position:0%
out all over they looked like Tire
 
05:04:47.628 --> 05:04:47.638 align:start position:0%
whiskers to me
 
05:04:50.930 --> 05:04:50.940 align:start position:0%
fortunately we were close to an exit and
 
05:04:53.690 --> 05:04:53.700 align:start position:0%
another motorist helped us get to a
 
05:04:57.890 --> 05:04:57.900 align:start position:0%
close by filling station parking lot
 
05:05:00.708 --> 05:05:00.718 align:start position:0%
Troutville as you may imagine is a very
 
05:05:04.190 --> 05:05:04.200 align:start position:0%
rural area but most importantly we were
 
05:05:06.590 --> 05:05:06.600 align:start position:0%
able to get off the interstate and we
 
05:05:08.868 --> 05:05:08.878 align:start position:0%
were grateful that we didn't have nor
 
05:05:11.810 --> 05:05:11.820 align:start position:0%
cause a highway accident from the blown
 
05:05:11.820 --> 05:05:12.948 align:start position:0%
cause a highway accident from the blown
tire

05:05:12.948 --> 05:05:12.958 align:start position:0%
tire
 
05:05:15.590 --> 05:05:15.600 align:start position:0%
just anecdotally when I was on my way up
 
05:05:18.288 --> 05:05:18.298 align:start position:0%
here I glanced at my phone and I saw a
 
05:05:21.610 --> 05:05:21.620 align:start position:0%
blurb the NTSB reports that tire
 
05:05:24.770 --> 05:05:24.780 align:start position:0%
malfunctions contribute to almost 19
 
05:05:28.070 --> 05:05:28.080 align:start position:0%
000 motor vehicle accident injuries each
 
05:05:30.770 --> 05:05:30.780 align:start position:0%
year okay and then the date on that was
 
05:05:30.780 --> 05:05:32.448 align:start position:0%
year okay and then the date on that was
2022.

05:05:32.448 --> 05:05:32.458 align:start position:0%
2022.
 
05:05:35.810 --> 05:05:35.820 align:start position:0%
the next day with our spare tire on WE
 
05:05:38.448 --> 05:05:38.458 align:start position:0%
cautiously drove to a tire dealer to get
 
05:05:40.910 --> 05:05:40.920 align:start position:0%
a new set of tires one of the tire
 
05:05:43.490 --> 05:05:43.500 align:start position:0%
installers commented about the age of
 
05:05:46.670 --> 05:05:46.680 align:start position:0%
the tires that we were replacing he said
 
05:05:49.250 --> 05:05:49.260 align:start position:0%
our trailer tires were eight between
 
05:05:52.730 --> 05:05:52.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:52.740 --> 05:05:55.430 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

05:05:55.430 --> 05:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
05:05:57.288 --> 05:05:57.298 align:start position:0%
the most common recommendation for
 
05:06:00.050 --> 05:06:00.060 align:start position:0%
trailer tires replacement is three to
 
05:06:01.250 --> 05:06:01.260 align:start position:0%
six years
 
05:06:03.410 --> 05:06:03.420 align:start position:0%
and most buyers don't even think about
 
05:06:05.208 --> 05:06:05.218 align:start position:0%
the trailer tires
 
05:06:07.850 --> 05:06:07.860 align:start position:0%
especially if they've fancied up the
 
05:06:09.890 --> 05:06:09.900 align:start position:0%
side walls made them look good in the
 
05:06:12.530 --> 05:06:12.540 align:start position:0%
trailer it's in the tire itself
 
05:06:14.690 --> 05:06:14.700 align:start position:0%
has a lot of Tread On It people don't
 
05:06:17.270 --> 05:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
think about that and
 
05:06:17.280 --> 05:06:18.410 align:start position:0%
think about that and
um

05:06:18.410 --> 05:06:18.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:06:21.288 --> 05:06:21.298 align:start position:0%
however there can be dry rot inside the
 
05:06:23.990 --> 05:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
tire you can't see it and it can lead to
 
05:06:25.490 --> 05:06:25.500 align:start position:0%
Tire failure
 
05:06:27.708 --> 05:06:27.718 align:start position:0%
in the older the tires are the higher
 
05:06:31.610 --> 05:06:31.620 align:start position:0%
the risk of of blowout
 
05:06:33.170 --> 05:06:33.180 align:start position:0%
um most and the other another thing
 
05:06:34.730 --> 05:06:34.740 align:start position:0%
about trailers is that most Tire
 
05:06:37.610 --> 05:06:37.620 align:start position:0%
trailers are subject to long periods of
 
05:06:37.620 --> 05:06:38.868 align:start position:0%
trailers are subject to long periods of
non-use

05:06:38.868 --> 05:06:38.878 align:start position:0%
non-use
 
05:06:42.110 --> 05:06:42.120 align:start position:0%
in less than optimal conditions
 
05:06:45.170 --> 05:06:45.180 align:start position:0%
so the tires age more rapidly
 
05:06:48.170 --> 05:06:48.180 align:start position:0%
on than on other vehicles
 
05:06:51.050 --> 05:06:51.060 align:start position:0%
however and the reason for that is
 
05:06:53.570 --> 05:06:53.580 align:start position:0%
tires on other vehicles that are in
 
05:06:55.610 --> 05:06:55.620 align:start position:0%
constant use release compounds that
 
05:06:58.490 --> 05:06:58.500 align:start position:0%
increase the longevity of the tires
 
05:07:00.770 --> 05:07:00.780 align:start position:0%
and we passed out some pictures to you
 
05:07:03.110 --> 05:07:03.120 align:start position:0%
and those are two of the tires that we
 
05:07:04.550 --> 05:07:04.560 align:start position:0%
brought home with us
 
05:07:07.610 --> 05:07:07.620 align:start position:0%
and and we used uh just to show you what
 
05:07:09.650 --> 05:07:09.660 align:start position:0%
the tires look like and and some of the
 
05:07:12.948 --> 05:07:12.958 align:start position:0%
things how how well they looked when we
 
05:07:15.890 --> 05:07:15.900 align:start position:0%
uh bought the trailer at the time
 
05:07:18.470 --> 05:07:18.480 align:start position:0%
and in the pictures we passed out you
 
05:07:19.730 --> 05:07:19.740 align:start position:0%
see tires from the trailer the picture
 
05:07:22.128 --> 05:07:22.138 align:start position:0%
show damage of Tire separation and on
 
05:07:24.310 --> 05:07:24.320 align:start position:0%
the undamaged tire
 
05:07:27.170 --> 05:07:27.180 align:start position:0%
and uh tire tread on the on the
 
05:07:29.330 --> 05:07:29.340 align:start position:0%
undamaged tire Separation on the damaged
 
05:07:32.390 --> 05:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
tire and tire trade on the uh
 
05:07:35.150 --> 05:07:35.160 align:start position:0%
the undamaged tire and it was it really
 
05:07:36.948 --> 05:07:36.958 align:start position:0%
really looked good and of course they
 
05:07:39.110 --> 05:07:39.120 align:start position:0%
put Tire blank on it and whatever but it
 
05:07:41.390 --> 05:07:41.400 align:start position:0%
was also inspected afterwards with an
 
05:07:43.730 --> 05:07:43.740 align:start position:0%
inspection and uh
 
05:07:45.830 --> 05:07:45.840 align:start position:0%
that's another issue another issue for
 
05:07:48.770 --> 05:07:48.780 align:start position:0%
us but not pertinent to the bill
 
05:07:48.780 --> 05:07:49.550 align:start position:0%
us but not pertinent to the bill
um

05:07:49.550 --> 05:07:49.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:07:53.208 --> 05:07:53.218 align:start position:0%
and one of the in the on the tire it
 
05:07:55.070 --> 05:07:55.080 align:start position:0%
shows the tire code and the vent spews
 
05:07:57.050 --> 05:07:57.060 align:start position:0%
now the vent spews are the little pieces
 
05:07:58.430 --> 05:07:58.440 align:start position:0%
of rubber that you can see around your
 
05:08:00.110 --> 05:08:00.120 align:start position:0%
tire when it's brand new they usually
 
05:08:04.030 --> 05:08:04.040 align:start position:0%
wear off in a few years on these tires
 
05:08:07.010 --> 05:08:07.020 align:start position:0%
you the picture that says ven spews you
 
05:08:10.010 --> 05:08:10.020 align:start position:0%
can see that those little uh Tire
 
05:08:11.810 --> 05:08:11.820 align:start position:0%
whatever you want to call them event
 
05:08:15.170 --> 05:08:15.180 align:start position:0%
spreads are still on the tires even
 
05:08:17.390 --> 05:08:17.400 align:start position:0%
those those tires are it were eight to
 
05:08:18.948 --> 05:08:18.958 align:start position:0%
nine years old at the time that we got
 
05:08:21.050 --> 05:08:21.060 align:start position:0%
the trailer
 
05:08:23.628 --> 05:08:23.638 align:start position:0%
another thing to know is I learned a lot
 
05:08:25.430 --> 05:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
about what I didn't know about Tire age
 
05:08:29.690 --> 05:08:29.700 align:start position:0%
there is a there is a code on every Tire
 
05:08:31.850 --> 05:08:31.860 align:start position:0%
but that code isn't made for consumers
 
05:08:34.910 --> 05:08:34.920 align:start position:0%
because the the code that you see is
 
05:08:37.490 --> 05:08:37.500 align:start position:0%
zero three one three so you might think
 
05:08:41.868 --> 05:08:41.878 align:start position:0%
that's maybe that's January of 2013.
 
05:08:44.470 --> 05:08:44.480 align:start position:0%
well not really it's the first week of
 
05:08:48.470 --> 05:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
2013. so the entire industry has put
 
05:08:50.750 --> 05:08:50.760 align:start position:0%
that code on there mainly for their use
 
05:08:53.690 --> 05:08:53.700 align:start position:0%
and for the use of Tire Specialists who
 
05:08:55.970 --> 05:08:55.980 align:start position:0%
who want to look at a tire when my wife
 
05:08:58.250 --> 05:08:58.260 align:start position:0%
mentioned the we had the tire replaced
 
05:09:00.708 --> 05:09:00.718 align:start position:0%
the people that replacer said we don't
 
05:09:03.470 --> 05:09:03.480 align:start position:0%
even service tires that are more than
 
05:09:05.628 --> 05:09:05.638 align:start position:0%
six years old
 
05:09:05.638 --> 05:09:07.970 align:start position:0%
six years old
so

05:09:07.970 --> 05:09:07.980 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:09:09.708 --> 05:09:09.718 align:start position:0%
and you can get it so you can get into
 
05:09:11.330 --> 05:09:11.340 align:start position:0%
in the later parts of the Year things
 
05:09:13.910 --> 05:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
like 22 uh
 
05:09:18.110 --> 05:09:18.120 align:start position:0%
13 which would mean the 22nd week of
 
05:09:18.120 --> 05:09:22.310 align:start position:0%
13 which would mean the 22nd week of
2013.

05:09:22.310 --> 05:09:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:25.850 --> 05:09:25.860 align:start position:0%
so so that's what I learned about Tire
 
05:09:28.070 --> 05:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
coding and age of tires but most people
 
05:09:30.770 --> 05:09:30.780 align:start position:0%
don't even think about that
 
05:09:30.780 --> 05:09:32.890 align:start position:0%
don't even think about that
so

05:09:32.890 --> 05:09:32.900 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:09:37.010 --> 05:09:37.020 align:start position:0%
House Bill 132 is structured to put very
 
05:09:41.090 --> 05:09:41.100 align:start position:0%
little burden on trailer dealers it only
 
05:09:44.448 --> 05:09:44.458 align:start position:0%
requires that the dealer shall provide
 
05:09:47.170 --> 05:09:47.180 align:start position:0%
to the buyer a written document
 
05:09:50.208 --> 05:09:50.218 align:start position:0%
disclosing the age and manufacture date
 
05:09:53.270 --> 05:09:53.280 align:start position:0%
of all the tires on the trailer
 
05:09:56.150 --> 05:09:56.160 align:start position:0%
the written discloser shall be delivered
 
05:09:58.550 --> 05:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
to the buyer before the buyer signs
 
05:10:01.430 --> 05:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
documents that complete the sale
 
05:10:04.730 --> 05:10:04.740 align:start position:0%
buyers will no longer need to determine
 
05:10:07.270 --> 05:10:07.280 align:start position:0%
Tire age themselves the information
 
05:10:10.550 --> 05:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
provided would allow buyers to factor
 
05:10:14.030 --> 05:10:14.040 align:start position:0%
Tire age into their calculations as they
 
05:10:17.330 --> 05:10:17.340 align:start position:0%
go ahead or not with the purchase this
 
05:10:19.610 --> 05:10:19.620 align:start position:0%
disclosure will help prevent the sale of
 
05:10:23.570 --> 05:10:23.580 align:start position:0%
trailers that have dangerously old tires
 
05:10:26.628 --> 05:10:26.638 align:start position:0%
and we hope that there will be positive
 
05:10:29.810 --> 05:10:29.820 align:start position:0%
consideration for this Bill thank you
 
05:10:32.030 --> 05:10:32.040 align:start position:0%
excuse me thank you questions from the
 
05:10:34.490 --> 05:10:34.500 align:start position:0%
committee representative Hill
 
05:10:36.110 --> 05:10:36.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
05:10:39.050 --> 05:10:39.060 align:start position:0%
taking my question Representatives
 
05:10:41.570 --> 05:10:41.580 align:start position:0%
um I'm wondering if you considered
 
05:10:41.580 --> 05:10:42.650 align:start position:0%
um I'm wondering if you considered
having

05:10:42.650 --> 05:10:42.660 align:start position:0%
having
 
05:10:45.470 --> 05:10:45.480 align:start position:0%
um uh speed rating mentioned on that
 
05:10:47.150 --> 05:10:47.160 align:start position:0%
disclosure as well
 
05:10:47.160 --> 05:10:47.930 align:start position:0%
disclosure as well
um

05:10:47.930 --> 05:10:47.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:10:51.230 --> 05:10:51.240 align:start position:0%
there's there's a a whole series of
 
05:10:53.570 --> 05:10:53.580 align:start position:0%
speed ratings that the tires are set up
 
05:10:55.250 --> 05:10:55.260 align:start position:0%
for and I always figure most of the
 
05:10:56.990 --> 05:10:57.000 align:start position:0%
people driving by me are exceeding
 
05:10:58.970 --> 05:10:58.980 align:start position:0%
whatever the speed rating is on their
 
05:11:01.788 --> 05:11:01.798 align:start position:0%
trailer tire anyway but I wondered if
 
05:11:03.830 --> 05:11:03.840 align:start position:0%
that was something you would consider
 
05:11:08.150 --> 05:11:08.160 align:start position:0%
adding no I'm not aware of that I would
 
05:11:10.970 --> 05:11:10.980 align:start position:0%
I think we would have no objection to an
 
05:11:13.368 --> 05:11:13.378 align:start position:0%
improving amendment that that might be
 
05:11:15.890 --> 05:11:15.900 align:start position:0%
added for that but that is also on the
 
05:11:17.750 --> 05:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
tire and it is there and but when you
 
05:11:20.330 --> 05:11:20.340 align:start position:0%
buy a a tire that's specifically
 
05:11:23.750 --> 05:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
designed for for trailers
 
05:11:27.470 --> 05:11:27.480 align:start position:0%
um they uh they have a speed rating but
 
05:11:30.170 --> 05:11:30.180 align:start position:0%
and I see people exceeding the speed
 
05:11:31.970 --> 05:11:31.980 align:start position:0%
ratings but we certainly took it into
 
05:11:33.288 --> 05:11:33.298 align:start position:0%
consideration when we're buying the
 
05:11:34.730 --> 05:11:34.740 align:start position:0%
spear that we had to have because it
 
05:11:36.110 --> 05:11:36.120 align:start position:0%
wasn't much fun sitting down at that
 
05:11:37.490 --> 05:11:37.500 align:start position:0%
bottom of the exit as it was getting
 
05:11:37.500 --> 05:11:38.770 align:start position:0%
bottom of the exit as it was getting
dark

05:11:38.770 --> 05:11:38.780 align:start position:0%
dark
 
05:11:43.368 --> 05:11:43.378 align:start position:0%
I I would I would just add that for our
 
05:11:45.590 --> 05:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
particular first time out with this
 
05:11:45.600 --> 05:11:46.610 align:start position:0%
particular first time out with this
trailer

05:11:46.610 --> 05:11:46.620 align:start position:0%
trailer
 
05:11:49.550 --> 05:11:49.560 align:start position:0%
and the tires that it had on it we were
 
05:11:52.430 --> 05:11:52.440 align:start position:0%
exceptionally cautious in driving and
 
05:11:54.890 --> 05:11:54.900 align:start position:0%
our road speeds I don't think we went
 
05:11:57.948 --> 05:11:57.958 align:start position:0%
over 65 was top we were generally
 
05:12:02.030 --> 05:12:02.040 align:start position:0%
between 60 and 65 for the entire trip
 
05:12:05.030 --> 05:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
um I'll just mention that
 
05:12:07.250 --> 05:12:07.260 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
05:12:12.970 --> 05:12:12.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:16.850 --> 05:12:16.860 align:start position:0%
my good friends uh have you given any I
 
05:12:19.190 --> 05:12:19.200 align:start position:0%
think this is great information for the
 
05:12:20.690 --> 05:12:20.700 align:start position:0%
public to know but have you given any
 
05:12:22.490 --> 05:12:22.500 align:start position:0%
consideration to reach out to our
 
05:12:24.230 --> 05:12:24.240 align:start position:0%
federal representative representatives
 
05:12:26.628 --> 05:12:26.638 align:start position:0%
to perhaps make this a national bill
 
05:12:29.510 --> 05:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
that every Tire manufactured in this
 
05:12:31.970 --> 05:12:31.980 align:start position:0%
country or sold in this country has an
 
05:12:33.708 --> 05:12:33.718 align:start position:0%
actual date that people can understand
 
05:12:38.448 --> 05:12:38.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:41.208 --> 05:12:41.218 align:start position:0%
I we have we have not reached out I've
 
05:12:43.788 --> 05:12:43.798 align:start position:0%
thought about it and
 
05:12:43.798 --> 05:12:44.390 align:start position:0%
thought about it and
um

05:12:44.390 --> 05:12:44.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:12:47.090 --> 05:12:47.100 align:start position:0%
previously there was a time previous to
 
05:12:48.948 --> 05:12:48.958 align:start position:0%
this that I was thinking about Tire age
 
05:12:51.650 --> 05:12:51.660 align:start position:0%
and whatnot and bills like that
 
05:12:55.850 --> 05:12:55.860 align:start position:0%
that require something of the tires that
 
05:12:58.430 --> 05:12:58.440 align:start position:0%
are on cars and stuff like that in in
 
05:13:01.490 --> 05:13:01.500 align:start position:0%
there is tremendous pushback
 
05:13:04.490 --> 05:13:04.500 align:start position:0%
from the tire industry about having to
 
05:13:07.788 --> 05:13:07.798 align:start position:0%
do that or at least for putting I mean I
 
05:13:09.890 --> 05:13:09.900 align:start position:0%
I think that there should probably be a
 
05:13:12.250 --> 05:13:12.260 align:start position:0%
maximum of 10 years because
 
05:13:15.170 --> 05:13:15.180 align:start position:0%
these are only for use this bill only
 
05:13:19.070 --> 05:13:19.080 align:start position:0%
applies to used trailers resale trailers
 
05:13:23.090 --> 05:13:23.100 align:start position:0%
and so the the bigger trailer businesses
 
05:13:25.368 --> 05:13:25.378 align:start position:0%
they sell most of their stuff that are
 
05:13:28.550 --> 05:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
on new tire and new trailers and
 
05:13:30.890 --> 05:13:30.900 align:start position:0%
um so it shouldn't do a lot of impact
 
05:13:33.708 --> 05:13:33.718 align:start position:0%
now I I actually feel had to sign a
 
05:13:35.208 --> 05:13:35.218 align:start position:0%
bunch of
 
05:13:37.970 --> 05:13:37.980 align:start position:0%
um small print documents that before I
 
05:13:40.850 --> 05:13:40.860 align:start position:0%
bought the trailer and if I had had this
 
05:13:42.650 --> 05:13:42.660 align:start position:0%
kind of information to me it would it
 
05:13:44.868 --> 05:13:44.878 align:start position:0%
would have at least peaked in my mind
 
05:13:44.878 --> 05:13:45.890 align:start position:0%
would have at least peaked in my mind
that

05:13:45.890 --> 05:13:45.900 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:13:47.750 --> 05:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
that what what are you going to do we
 
05:13:49.430 --> 05:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
were constantly assured that we would
 
05:13:51.708 --> 05:13:51.718 align:start position:0%
never put unsafe trailer tires on the
 
05:13:51.718 --> 05:13:53.090 align:start position:0%
never put unsafe trailer tires on the
trailer

05:13:53.090 --> 05:13:53.100 align:start position:0%
trailer
 
05:13:56.030 --> 05:13:56.040 align:start position:0%
and we ended up with what happened to us
 
05:13:58.190 --> 05:13:58.200 align:start position:0%
so I thought that this information would
 
05:14:02.750 --> 05:14:02.760 align:start position:0%
be easily provided by the by any used
 
05:14:06.530 --> 05:14:06.540 align:start position:0%
trailer tire dealer without too much
 
05:14:08.628 --> 05:14:08.638 align:start position:0%
burden on them at all
 
05:14:10.190 --> 05:14:10.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:14:11.810 --> 05:14:11.820 align:start position:0%
what are the questions
 
05:14:11.820 --> 05:14:14.330 align:start position:0%
what are the questions
representative

05:14:14.330 --> 05:14:14.340 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:14:15.470 --> 05:14:15.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
05:14:16.850 --> 05:14:16.860 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
05:14:20.448 --> 05:14:20.458 align:start position:0%
um one of the questions I have would
 
05:14:24.110 --> 05:14:24.120 align:start position:0%
this form have the safety standards
 
05:14:26.270 --> 05:14:26.280 align:start position:0%
spelled out on it because otherwise I
 
05:14:28.070 --> 05:14:28.080 align:start position:0%
might just grab the form and say oh
 
05:14:29.150 --> 05:14:29.160 align:start position:0%
that's great information thank you for
 
05:14:31.070 --> 05:14:31.080 align:start position:0%
providing it and not know the difference
 
05:14:33.470 --> 05:14:33.480 align:start position:0%
and you know
 
05:14:33.480 --> 05:14:34.190 align:start position:0%
and you know
um

05:14:34.190 --> 05:14:34.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:14:35.868 --> 05:14:35.878 align:start position:0%
if it is a safety standard would it be
 
05:14:37.610 --> 05:14:37.620 align:start position:0%
better to put it on the inspection
 
05:14:40.190 --> 05:14:40.200 align:start position:0%
requirements and then have recourse in
 
05:14:42.288 --> 05:14:42.298 align:start position:0%
the end if if you are sold one tires
 
05:14:44.690 --> 05:14:44.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:47.690 --> 05:14:47.700 align:start position:0%
inadequate oh it
 
05:14:50.208 --> 05:14:50.218 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question
 
05:14:53.868 --> 05:14:53.878 align:start position:0%
um I looked at it mostly as a disclosure
 
05:14:57.230 --> 05:14:57.240 align:start position:0%
of what the age the S the the
 
05:14:59.930 --> 05:14:59.940 align:start position:0%
um almost a an exact estimate of what
 
05:15:01.910 --> 05:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
the age of the tires is
 
05:15:04.190 --> 05:15:04.200 align:start position:0%
I I totally understand what you're
 
05:15:07.010 --> 05:15:07.020 align:start position:0%
saying and I don't disagree with that
 
05:15:09.770 --> 05:15:09.780 align:start position:0%
but again I didn't want to
 
05:15:09.780 --> 05:15:10.628 align:start position:0%
but again I didn't want to
um

05:15:10.628 --> 05:15:10.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:15:14.390 --> 05:15:14.400 align:start position:0%
I was concerned about I was concerned
 
05:15:17.690 --> 05:15:17.700 align:start position:0%
about what the dealers would be able to
 
05:15:20.810 --> 05:15:20.820 align:start position:0%
agree to and and I guess I looked at it
 
05:15:22.910 --> 05:15:22.920 align:start position:0%
that even when we were getting our
 
05:15:22.920 --> 05:15:24.410 align:start position:0%
that even when we were getting our
trailer

05:15:24.410 --> 05:15:24.420 align:start position:0%
trailer
 
05:15:26.510 --> 05:15:26.520 align:start position:0%
um had we seen something that said your
 
05:15:28.670 --> 05:15:28.680 align:start position:0%
trailers here's the numbers on them and
 
05:15:30.288 --> 05:15:30.298 align:start position:0%
they're between eight and nine years old
 
05:15:33.590 --> 05:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
it would have prompted me to do a little
 
05:15:37.190 --> 05:15:37.200 align:start position:0%
more research even if I went to a tire
 
05:15:40.010 --> 05:15:40.020 align:start position:0%
dealer and said what does this mean how
 
05:15:42.590 --> 05:15:42.600 align:start position:0%
old are my tires they're eight or nine
 
05:15:46.250 --> 05:15:46.260 align:start position:0%
years old is that good for a trailer I
 
05:15:48.890 --> 05:15:48.900 align:start position:0%
guess anecdotally again when we were in
 
05:15:51.708 --> 05:15:51.718 align:start position:0%
Florida this past November we talked to
 
05:15:53.350 --> 05:15:53.360 align:start position:0%
a professional
 
05:15:57.110 --> 05:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
trailer mover person he moves RVs boats
 
05:15:59.868 --> 05:15:59.878 align:start position:0%
whatever needs moving around and I asked
 
05:16:01.670 --> 05:16:01.680 align:start position:0%
him so how old should travel trailer
 
05:16:05.030 --> 05:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
tires be he said he didn't he didn't
 
05:16:07.490 --> 05:16:07.500 align:start position:0%
skip a beat he didn't I don't think he
 
05:16:08.868 --> 05:16:08.878 align:start position:0%
stopped for a breath he said no more
 
05:16:11.150 --> 05:16:11.160 align:start position:0%
than five years old he said that's the
 
05:16:12.410 --> 05:16:12.420 align:start position:0%
bottom line
 
05:16:12.420 --> 05:16:13.490 align:start position:0%
bottom line
um

05:16:13.490 --> 05:16:13.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:16:15.650 --> 05:16:15.660 align:start position:0%
and there are no inspections for
 
05:16:17.750 --> 05:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
trailers in this state
 
05:16:19.910 --> 05:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
and so when we said it was inspected
 
05:16:22.190 --> 05:16:22.200 align:start position:0%
there was an inspection done for us
 
05:16:24.890 --> 05:16:24.900 align:start position:0%
afterwards that actually had a question
 
05:16:26.810 --> 05:16:26.820 align:start position:0%
about that on it we didn't
 
05:16:29.510 --> 05:16:29.520 align:start position:0%
there were issues with the way the
 
05:16:32.350 --> 05:16:32.360 align:start position:0%
documents that we signed were presented
 
05:16:35.270 --> 05:16:35.280 align:start position:0%
and so the information on the tire age
 
05:16:36.650 --> 05:16:36.660 align:start position:0%
even though it was part of the
 
05:16:39.050 --> 05:16:39.060 align:start position:0%
inspection was not it was it was not
 
05:16:40.910 --> 05:16:40.920 align:start position:0%
checked they didn't fill it in
 
05:16:44.690 --> 05:16:44.700 align:start position:0%
so but I do agree this bill only says
 
05:16:44.700 --> 05:16:45.730 align:start position:0%
so but I do agree this bill only says
exactly

05:16:45.730 --> 05:16:45.740 align:start position:0%
exactly
 
05:16:48.650 --> 05:16:48.660 align:start position:0%
the only requirements it has is what's
 
05:16:49.670 --> 05:16:49.680 align:start position:0%
in the bill
 
05:16:51.770 --> 05:16:51.780 align:start position:0%
but if someone wants to put an amendment
 
05:16:54.050 --> 05:16:54.060 align:start position:0%
on there to improve it to put on speed
 
05:16:54.060 --> 05:16:55.190 align:start position:0%
on there to improve it to put on speed
ratings

05:16:55.190 --> 05:16:55.200 align:start position:0%
ratings
 
05:16:59.030 --> 05:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
um or I mean it does say that this must
 
05:17:03.050 --> 05:17:03.060 align:start position:0%
be completed prior to the in in to the
 
05:17:04.970 --> 05:17:04.980 align:start position:0%
sale so they would get it and have to
 
05:17:06.170 --> 05:17:06.180 align:start position:0%
sign it but
 
05:17:09.350 --> 05:17:09.360 align:start position:0%
I I thought that a bill should not have
 
05:17:11.390 --> 05:17:11.400 align:start position:0%
this those kind of specific details
 
05:17:13.788 --> 05:17:13.798 align:start position:0%
maybe I'm mistaken but that that would
 
05:17:15.650 --> 05:17:15.660 align:start position:0%
come into regulations of the people that
 
05:17:17.390 --> 05:17:17.400 align:start position:0%
that do the license insurer to the
 
05:17:19.310 --> 05:17:19.320 align:start position:0%
dealer they would determine
 
05:17:24.590 --> 05:17:24.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:26.868 --> 05:17:26.878 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
05:17:28.970 --> 05:17:28.980 align:start position:0%
representative C
 
05:17:30.708 --> 05:17:30.718 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
05:17:33.890 --> 05:17:33.900 align:start position:0%
um quick question uh
 
05:17:36.288 --> 05:17:36.298 align:start position:0%
you specify in here that this has to be
 
05:17:38.330 --> 05:17:38.340 align:start position:0%
a separate document rather in some part
 
05:17:40.670 --> 05:17:40.680 align:start position:0%
of some checklist could you elaborate on
 
05:17:40.680 --> 05:17:42.410 align:start position:0%
of some checklist could you elaborate on
that

05:17:42.410 --> 05:17:42.420 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:17:43.970 --> 05:17:43.980 align:start position:0%
yeah that's true
 
05:17:43.980 --> 05:17:45.410 align:start position:0%
yeah that's true
um

05:17:45.410 --> 05:17:45.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:17:48.410 --> 05:17:48.420 align:start position:0%
the experience that we had was there was
 
05:17:53.510 --> 05:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
there was a presentation of uh
 
05:17:56.990 --> 05:17:57.000 align:start position:0%
inspection That was supposed to ensure
 
05:17:58.788 --> 05:17:58.798 align:start position:0%
that everything was in proper working
 
05:18:01.190 --> 05:18:01.200 align:start position:0%
order when you left
 
05:18:04.070 --> 05:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
the trailer dealer
 
05:18:07.610 --> 05:18:07.620 align:start position:0%
and the reason we want this to be
 
05:18:10.070 --> 05:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
specific maybe I've lost your question
 
05:18:10.080 --> 05:18:12.230 align:start position:0%
specific maybe I've lost your question
is

05:18:12.230 --> 05:18:12.240 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:18:15.890 --> 05:18:15.900 align:start position:0%
well just one more time what what uh the
 
05:18:18.530 --> 05:18:18.540 align:start position:0%
question had to do is why not have this
 
05:18:21.410 --> 05:18:21.420 align:start position:0%
as part of a checklist a generalized
 
05:18:23.150 --> 05:18:23.160 align:start position:0%
checklist instead of having to be a
 
05:18:25.070 --> 05:18:25.080 align:start position:0%
specific document
 
05:18:28.610 --> 05:18:28.620 align:start position:0%
well because this I actually did get a
 
05:18:29.750 --> 05:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
checklist that they were going to use
 
05:18:31.550 --> 05:18:31.560 align:start position:0%
for the inspection
 
05:18:35.510 --> 05:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
and it had 156 items on it entire was
 
05:18:39.170 --> 05:18:39.180 align:start position:0%
one of those little 156 items so I and
 
05:18:40.910 --> 05:18:40.920 align:start position:0%
most of the things on a trailer other
 
05:18:44.208 --> 05:18:44.218 align:start position:0%
than the wheels is not dangerous to you
 
05:18:45.650 --> 05:18:45.660 align:start position:0%
it's not going to flip your trailer over
 
05:18:47.090 --> 05:18:47.100 align:start position:0%
it's not going to flip your truck over
 
05:18:50.390 --> 05:18:50.400 align:start position:0%
so we envisioned this
 
05:18:50.400 --> 05:18:51.430 align:start position:0%
so we envisioned this
um

05:18:51.430 --> 05:18:51.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:18:54.410 --> 05:18:54.420 align:start position:0%
disclosure to be by itself
 
05:18:56.990 --> 05:18:57.000 align:start position:0%
about tires and specifically telling you
 
05:18:59.090 --> 05:18:59.100 align:start position:0%
the date that how old they are they're
 
05:19:00.890 --> 05:19:00.900 align:start position:0%
eight-year-old they're eight years old
 
05:19:02.628 --> 05:19:02.638 align:start position:0%
and using the tire code they can easily
 
05:19:06.230 --> 05:19:06.240 align:start position:0%
see that and they were January of 2013
 
05:19:07.850 --> 05:19:07.860 align:start position:0%
or whatever it was
 
05:19:10.850 --> 05:19:10.860 align:start position:0%
so I we envisioned something that would
 
05:19:12.830 --> 05:19:12.840 align:start position:0%
stand out to the buyer when he's
 
05:19:15.110 --> 05:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
flipping through these that says tire
 
05:19:17.570 --> 05:19:17.580 align:start position:0%
age disclosure but we didn't try to put
 
05:19:20.628 --> 05:19:20.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:23.208 --> 05:19:23.218 align:start position:0%
for the questions
 
05:19:25.368 --> 05:19:25.378 align:start position:0%
seeing that I have one uh just a simple
 
05:19:25.378 --> 05:19:27.410 align:start position:0%
seeing that I have one uh just a simple
one

05:19:27.410 --> 05:19:27.420 align:start position:0%
one
 
05:19:30.708 --> 05:19:30.718 align:start position:0%
um are you 100 sure that the inflation
 
05:19:32.930 --> 05:19:32.940 align:start position:0%
the tires were inflated correctly
 
05:19:35.208 --> 05:19:35.218 align:start position:0%
or that you didn't pick up a nail or cut
 
05:19:37.550 --> 05:19:37.560 align:start position:0%
the tire on a curb
 
05:19:38.930 --> 05:19:38.940 align:start position:0%
for example
 
05:19:41.030 --> 05:19:41.040 align:start position:0%
no we check that the inflation was
 
05:19:42.830 --> 05:19:42.840 align:start position:0%
correct when we left I mean we we
 
05:19:47.030 --> 05:19:47.040 align:start position:0%
checked that before we go right so but
 
05:19:47.040 --> 05:19:48.490 align:start position:0%
checked that before we go right so but
okay

05:19:48.490 --> 05:19:48.500 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:19:52.190 --> 05:19:52.200 align:start position:0%
I think the the the more serious part of
 
05:19:53.750 --> 05:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
it is is the way they determine the
 
05:19:56.868 --> 05:19:56.878 align:start position:0%
damage whether the tire is
 
05:19:56.878 --> 05:19:57.410 align:start position:0%
damage whether the tire is
um

05:19:57.410 --> 05:19:57.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:19:59.810 --> 05:19:59.820 align:start position:0%
needs to be changed or not by visual
 
05:20:03.050 --> 05:20:03.060 align:start position:0%
inspection is that you have to have a
 
05:20:04.850 --> 05:20:04.860 align:start position:0%
certain length of dry rot on the outside
 
05:20:06.650 --> 05:20:06.660 align:start position:0%
of the tire that's visible and whatever
 
05:20:09.170 --> 05:20:09.180 align:start position:0%
so so if the outside looks good and the
 
05:20:11.330 --> 05:20:11.340 align:start position:0%
tread is good the tire is good to go
 
05:20:13.850 --> 05:20:13.860 align:start position:0%
there's no there's nothing in in at
 
05:20:15.708 --> 05:20:15.718 align:start position:0%
least even in this was in the inspection
 
05:20:17.868 --> 05:20:17.878 align:start position:0%
that we had done and it said if you
 
05:20:19.550 --> 05:20:19.560 align:start position:0%
can't see it on the outside it's good to
 
05:20:19.560 --> 05:20:20.150 align:start position:0%
can't see it on the outside it's good to
go

05:20:20.150 --> 05:20:20.160 align:start position:0%
go
 
05:20:22.610 --> 05:20:22.620 align:start position:0%
oh there's another witness I'll ask in
 
05:20:24.830 --> 05:20:24.840 align:start position:0%
terms of the inspection and the dry rot
 
05:20:27.050 --> 05:20:27.060 align:start position:0%
did you inspect the tires yourself on
 
05:20:29.570 --> 05:20:29.580 align:start position:0%
the on the trailer
 
05:20:29.580 --> 05:20:31.310 align:start position:0%
the on the trailer
yeah

05:20:31.310 --> 05:20:31.320 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:20:34.610 --> 05:20:34.620 align:start position:0%
we visually I mean the trailer when we
 
05:20:37.490 --> 05:20:37.500 align:start position:0%
saw it it was parked so trailers I mean
 
05:20:40.190 --> 05:20:40.200 align:start position:0%
the tires are underneath just like
 
05:20:42.410 --> 05:20:42.420 align:start position:0%
you would expect them to be
 
05:20:42.420 --> 05:20:43.310 align:start position:0%
you would expect them to be
um

05:20:43.310 --> 05:20:43.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:20:47.150 --> 05:20:47.160 align:start position:0%
when I asked about tires and was told if
 
05:20:50.030 --> 05:20:50.040 align:start position:0%
it needs tires when we go over it you'll
 
05:20:52.010 --> 05:20:52.020 align:start position:0%
have new tires before you take it off
 
05:20:54.288 --> 05:20:54.298 align:start position:0%
the lot okay
 
05:20:57.230 --> 05:20:57.240 align:start position:0%
looking at the tires visually they
 
05:20:58.970 --> 05:20:58.980 align:start position:0%
looked fine and I could see there was
 
05:21:02.030 --> 05:21:02.040 align:start position:0%
plenty of tread that's the amount of the
 
05:21:04.190 --> 05:21:04.200 align:start position:0%
inspection I guess as to inflation
 
05:21:06.708 --> 05:21:06.718 align:start position:0%
though I will comment that when we had
 
05:21:09.350 --> 05:21:09.360 align:start position:0%
to get the spare on we discovered that
 
05:21:10.910 --> 05:21:10.920 align:start position:0%
the spare
 
05:21:13.430 --> 05:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
um we anyway that was a whole other
 
05:21:16.070 --> 05:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
story getting us us doing the US getting
 
05:21:18.288 --> 05:21:18.298 align:start position:0%
the spare on but we certainly recognize
 
05:21:21.170 --> 05:21:21.180 align:start position:0%
the importance of inflation and when new
 
05:21:23.570 --> 05:21:23.580 align:start position:0%
tires were put on I mean we were
 
05:21:25.670 --> 05:21:25.680 align:start position:0%
watching every step of the way and they
 
05:21:27.890 --> 05:21:27.900 align:start position:0%
corroborated and confirmed what the
 
05:21:31.430 --> 05:21:31.440 align:start position:0%
inflation rate was and off we went
 
05:21:33.470 --> 05:21:33.480 align:start position:0%
and another thing that was kind of
 
05:21:35.930 --> 05:21:35.940 align:start position:0%
interesting was that
 
05:21:35.940 --> 05:21:36.530 align:start position:0%
interesting was that
um

05:21:36.530 --> 05:21:36.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:21:36.540 --> 05:21:38.690 align:start position:0%
um
when

05:21:38.690 --> 05:21:38.700 align:start position:0%
when
 
05:21:41.110 --> 05:21:41.120 align:start position:0%
the interesting thing was that when we
 
05:21:44.628 --> 05:21:44.638 align:start position:0%
when we uh
 
05:21:46.990 --> 05:21:47.000 align:start position:0%
got the uh
 
05:21:49.368 --> 05:21:49.378 align:start position:0%
what's my train of thought
 
05:21:51.350 --> 05:21:51.360 align:start position:0%
okay I I would
 
05:21:53.330 --> 05:21:53.340 align:start position:0%
um I guess going back to a previous
 
05:21:57.170 --> 05:21:57.180 align:start position:0%
question the idea of a disclosure
 
05:22:01.010 --> 05:22:01.020 align:start position:0%
um to give the buyer information and I
 
05:22:03.948 --> 05:22:03.958 align:start position:0%
and I recognized that all buyers may not
 
05:22:08.690 --> 05:22:08.700 align:start position:0%
be aware of what an age should be on a
 
05:22:12.410 --> 05:22:12.420 align:start position:0%
trailer any utility trailer that they
 
05:22:14.868 --> 05:22:14.878 align:start position:0%
could be purchasing I would hope though
 
05:22:17.990 --> 05:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
that the disclosure would encourage them
 
05:22:21.288 --> 05:22:21.298 align:start position:0%
prompt them to check it out further
 
05:22:23.990 --> 05:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
somebody separate from a dealer go to a
 
05:22:26.570 --> 05:22:26.580 align:start position:0%
tire place and say what would this mean
 
05:22:30.170 --> 05:22:30.180 align:start position:0%
I'm considering buying XYZ the trailers
 
05:22:32.930 --> 05:22:32.940 align:start position:0%
on it are eight or nine years old would
 
05:22:34.730 --> 05:22:34.740 align:start position:0%
you do that is that something you would
 
05:22:37.850 --> 05:22:37.860 align:start position:0%
do so the buyer can get educated as to
 
05:22:41.510 --> 05:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
how to move forward or negotiate with
 
05:22:42.590 --> 05:22:42.600 align:start position:0%
the dealer
 
05:22:45.708 --> 05:22:45.718 align:start position:0%
my thought came back to me the the
 
05:22:47.868 --> 05:22:47.878 align:start position:0%
people constantly said you're gonna
 
05:22:50.270 --> 05:22:50.280 align:start position:0%
you're gonna get safe tires they never
 
05:22:53.628 --> 05:22:53.638 align:start position:0%
mentioned age and they always sent you
 
05:22:55.368 --> 05:22:55.378 align:start position:0%
back to the representative you were
 
05:22:57.708 --> 05:22:57.718 align:start position:0%
talking to to get a verbally get
 
05:23:00.050 --> 05:23:00.060 align:start position:0%
information from them when I went
 
05:23:02.750 --> 05:23:02.760 align:start position:0%
through the all of the fine print
 
05:23:04.788 --> 05:23:04.798 align:start position:0%
for the documents
 
05:23:07.910 --> 05:23:07.920 align:start position:0%
it had buried in about the fourth page
 
05:23:10.970 --> 05:23:10.980 align:start position:0%
was that you cannot trust any of the
 
05:23:14.810 --> 05:23:14.820 align:start position:0%
representations made by our our your the
 
05:23:16.128 --> 05:23:16.138 align:start position:0%
person who's selling you the tire
 
05:23:19.010 --> 05:23:19.020 align:start position:0%
everything has to be written and and
 
05:23:20.810 --> 05:23:20.820 align:start position:0%
this is the only thing that covers the
 
05:23:23.330 --> 05:23:23.340 align:start position:0%
tires so they they didn't mention age at
 
05:23:25.610 --> 05:23:25.620 align:start position:0%
all but they constantly said we wouldn't
 
05:23:28.670 --> 05:23:28.680 align:start position:0%
sell you unsafe tires so we had slight
 
05:23:30.590 --> 05:23:30.600 align:start position:0%
problem with that
 
05:23:36.530 --> 05:23:36.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:38.510 --> 05:23:38.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
05:23:39.708 --> 05:23:39.718 align:start position:0%
um and thank you for coming
 
05:23:39.718 --> 05:23:41.150 align:start position:0%
um and thank you for coming
Representatives

05:23:41.150 --> 05:23:41.160 align:start position:0%
Representatives
 
05:23:41.160 --> 05:23:42.650 align:start position:0%
Representatives
um

05:23:42.650 --> 05:23:42.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:23:45.070 --> 05:23:45.080 align:start position:0%
I've been a manufacturer's rep for years
 
05:23:48.610 --> 05:23:48.620 align:start position:0%
uh manufacturing many
 
05:23:50.510 --> 05:23:50.520 align:start position:0%
representing many different types of
 
05:23:52.610 --> 05:23:52.620 align:start position:0%
Manufacturers and one was a rubber
 
05:23:54.530 --> 05:23:54.540 align:start position:0%
company and not tires I don't pretend to
 
05:23:58.010 --> 05:23:58.020 align:start position:0%
be an expert on tires but um when uh
 
05:24:01.010 --> 05:24:01.020 align:start position:0%
back then when we were evaluating uh the
 
05:24:03.590 --> 05:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
Rubber products we would use the acronym
 
05:24:05.448 --> 05:24:05.458 align:start position:0%
stamp which stood for size temperature
 
05:24:07.850 --> 05:24:07.860 align:start position:0%
application media and pressure
 
05:24:10.190 --> 05:24:10.200 align:start position:0%
those are all things besides age which
 
05:24:13.010 --> 05:24:13.020 align:start position:0%
can affect the life of a rubber product
 
05:24:16.190 --> 05:24:16.200 align:start position:0%
besides a tire and do you think those
 
05:24:21.050 --> 05:24:21.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:22.910 --> 05:24:22.920 align:start position:0%
it would be nice if they considered all
 
05:24:24.170 --> 05:24:24.180 align:start position:0%
of those things
 
05:24:26.150 --> 05:24:26.160 align:start position:0%
and then they would have to apply that
 
05:24:28.910 --> 05:24:28.920 align:start position:0%
the consideration of those things to to
 
05:24:32.030 --> 05:24:32.040 align:start position:0%
the Tire in question on the trailer and
 
05:24:34.250 --> 05:24:34.260 align:start position:0%
they might do that but we we didn't we
 
05:24:37.788 --> 05:24:37.798 align:start position:0%
we think that when I when I brought the
 
05:24:40.430 --> 05:24:40.440 align:start position:0%
tires to the dealer to explain and they
 
05:24:42.890 --> 05:24:42.900 align:start position:0%
actually did pay for the tires that that
 
05:24:45.170 --> 05:24:45.180 align:start position:0%
broke they
 
05:24:47.330 --> 05:24:47.340 align:start position:0%
the tires there were some other issues
 
05:24:48.350 --> 05:24:48.360 align:start position:0%
that they didn't want to take
 
05:24:50.208 --> 05:24:50.218 align:start position:0%
responsibility for
 
05:24:50.218 --> 05:24:51.050 align:start position:0%
responsibility for
um

05:24:51.050 --> 05:24:51.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:24:53.510 --> 05:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
but the very first thing they said I
 
05:24:56.448 --> 05:24:56.458 align:start position:0%
said because I had then the I had to go
 
05:24:59.330 --> 05:24:59.340 align:start position:0%
digging to get the result they initially
 
05:25:01.730 --> 05:25:01.740 align:start position:0%
didn't give us the checklist result that
 
05:25:03.830 --> 05:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
I had gotten previously
 
05:25:07.670 --> 05:25:07.680 align:start position:0%
kind of Sir typical surreptitiously and
 
05:25:09.470 --> 05:25:09.480 align:start position:0%
so I knew what the inspection was
 
05:25:11.590 --> 05:25:11.600 align:start position:0%
supposed to do and when I actually saw
 
05:25:15.530 --> 05:25:15.540 align:start position:0%
what was on the check tire list there
 
05:25:16.788 --> 05:25:16.798 align:start position:0%
were some issues and there was no
 
05:25:18.230 --> 05:25:18.240 align:start position:0%
mention of age and there were a lot of
 
05:25:20.330 --> 05:25:20.340 align:start position:0%
things on it that weren't checked
 
05:25:22.550 --> 05:25:22.560 align:start position:0%
so so that was an issue but the first
 
05:25:24.650 --> 05:25:24.660 align:start position:0%
thing I said well this isn't checked
 
05:25:27.170 --> 05:25:27.180 align:start position:0%
what what what how old should the tires
 
05:25:28.490 --> 05:25:28.500 align:start position:0%
be what do you do there do you put the
 
05:25:30.890 --> 05:25:30.900 align:start position:0%
date there and they say oh I'm sure they
 
05:25:32.990 --> 05:25:33.000 align:start position:0%
they looked at it but it should be six
 
05:25:34.788 --> 05:25:34.798 align:start position:0%
to eight years but the tires were eight
 
05:25:36.830 --> 05:25:36.840 align:start position:0%
to nine you know eight to nine years so
 
05:25:40.070 --> 05:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
there's an issue with dealers but that
 
05:25:41.690 --> 05:25:41.700 align:start position:0%
has nothing to do with the bill I think
 
05:25:43.970 --> 05:25:43.980 align:start position:0%
that it's a good thing to get more
 
05:25:46.070 --> 05:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
disclosure for people especially for
 
05:25:49.610 --> 05:25:49.620 align:start position:0%
used trailers because new trailers come
 
05:25:51.770 --> 05:25:51.780 align:start position:0%
with new tires they come with all of
 
05:25:54.288 --> 05:25:54.298 align:start position:0%
that so This only affects so for the big
 
05:25:56.510 --> 05:25:56.520 align:start position:0%
deal is it's not a lot of trailers and
 
05:25:58.190 --> 05:25:58.200 align:start position:0%
it's only people that are licensed
 
05:26:00.830 --> 05:26:00.840 align:start position:0%
dealers so it doesn't affect individuals
 
05:26:02.628 --> 05:26:02.638 align:start position:0%
that are selling Tire to selling
 
05:26:05.288 --> 05:26:05.298 align:start position:0%
trailers so
 
05:26:08.570 --> 05:26:08.580 align:start position:0%
I I would just add I think this is would
 
05:26:12.288 --> 05:26:12.298 align:start position:0%
be a good start to for consumer
 
05:26:14.868 --> 05:26:14.878 align:start position:0%
protection for road safety protection
 
05:26:14.878 --> 05:26:16.368 align:start position:0%
protection for road safety protection
for

05:26:16.368 --> 05:26:16.378 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:26:18.830 --> 05:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
Highway accident avoidance things like
 
05:26:20.410 --> 05:26:20.420 align:start position:0%
that thank you any other questions
 
05:26:25.190 --> 05:26:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:27.530 --> 05:26:27.540 align:start position:0%
the chairman yes could I just add the
 
05:26:30.170 --> 05:26:30.180 align:start position:0%
shroutville Virginia is on the
 
05:26:33.708 --> 05:26:33.718 align:start position:0%
Appalachian Trail and quite often it's
 
05:26:35.750 --> 05:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
it's less than 500 people there but
 
05:26:37.970 --> 05:26:37.980 align:start position:0%
quite often hikers come out of the
 
05:26:40.310 --> 05:26:40.320 align:start position:0%
Appalachian Trail and visit in
 
05:26:42.410 --> 05:26:42.420 align:start position:0%
Troutville so
 
05:26:44.270 --> 05:26:44.280 align:start position:0%
there's your public service announcement
 
05:26:46.910 --> 05:26:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:51.110 --> 05:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
uh next up chair recognize is Nicholas
 
05:26:53.868 --> 05:26:53.878 align:start position:0%
rudovic I think I said that right
 
05:26:55.610 --> 05:26:55.620 align:start position:0%
um opposed to the bill representing the
 
05:26:57.890 --> 05:26:57.900 align:start position:0%

how was I with the name
 
05:27:04.788 --> 05:27:04.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:07.550 --> 05:27:07.560 align:start position:0%
uh chair Walsh Vice chair Gorski uh
 
05:27:09.170 --> 05:27:09.180 align:start position:0%
thank you today uh thank you for this
 
05:27:13.250 --> 05:27:13.260 align:start position:0%
opportunity to comment on hb132 my name
 
05:27:14.690 --> 05:27:14.700 align:start position:0%
is Nick rudowicz I'm senior manager of
 
05:27:16.368 --> 05:27:16.378 align:start position:0%
government Affairs for the RV industry
 
05:27:18.530 --> 05:27:18.540 align:start position:0%
Association uh the RV industry
 
05:27:20.448 --> 05:27:20.458 align:start position:0%
Association is the national trade
 
05:27:23.090 --> 05:27:23.100 align:start position:0%
Association which represents the diverse
 
05:27:24.948 --> 05:27:24.958 align:start position:0%
manufacturing businesses which
 
05:27:28.430 --> 05:27:28.440 align:start position:0%
manufactures about 98 of all RVs which
 
05:27:30.288 --> 05:27:30.298 align:start position:0%
are sold in the United States
 
05:27:33.470 --> 05:27:33.480 align:start position:0%
I'm here today to both One support my
 
05:27:36.050 --> 05:27:36.060 align:start position:0%
dealer partners and also to ask you to
 
05:27:38.570 --> 05:27:38.580 align:start position:0%
not Advance HP 132 any further in the
 
05:27:40.430 --> 05:27:40.440 align:start position:0%
legislative process
 
05:27:42.590 --> 05:27:42.600 align:start position:0%
first there is no need for a utility
 
05:27:44.750 --> 05:27:44.760 align:start position:0%
dealer or a deal or recreation vehicles
 
05:27:46.670 --> 05:27:46.680 align:start position:0%
to provide a written document disclosing
 
05:27:48.948 --> 05:27:48.958 align:start position:0%
the age and manufacture dates on tires
 
05:27:51.170 --> 05:27:51.180 align:start position:0%
of a towable RV
 
05:27:53.448 --> 05:27:53.458 align:start position:0%
in fact the code of federal regulations
 
05:27:56.590 --> 05:27:56.600 align:start position:0%
specifically CFR title 49
 
05:28:00.288 --> 05:28:00.298 align:start position:0%
574.5 requires the tire manufacturer to
 
05:28:02.690 --> 05:28:02.700 align:start position:0%
stamp the manufacturer week and year
 
05:28:05.270 --> 05:28:05.280 align:start position:0%
onto every Tire which is to be used on a
 
05:28:06.948 --> 05:28:06.958 align:start position:0%
vehicle which meets nits or regulation
 
05:28:10.368 --> 05:28:10.378 align:start position:0%
which towable recreation vehicles do
 
05:28:12.110 --> 05:28:12.120 align:start position:0%
um I'll go into this a little bit more
 
05:28:14.570 --> 05:28:14.580 align:start position:0%
on how this works on every Tire there's
 
05:28:16.730 --> 05:28:16.740 align:start position:0%
a 12 to 13 digit code the last four
 
05:28:18.110 --> 05:28:18.120 align:start position:0%
digits in this final group of the code
 
05:28:20.510 --> 05:28:20.520 align:start position:0%
which is stamped on every tire is the
 
05:28:22.788 --> 05:28:22.798 align:start position:0%
date code it's a simple system the first
 
05:28:24.530 --> 05:28:24.540 align:start position:0%
two dates of the last four in this code
 
05:28:26.750 --> 05:28:26.760 align:start position:0%
are the week of manufacture and the last
 
05:28:28.730 --> 05:28:28.740 align:start position:0%
two dates of the year of manufacture so
 
05:28:30.350 --> 05:28:30.360 align:start position:0%
if the tire was manufactured this week
 
05:28:33.830 --> 05:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
it would say 0323
 
05:28:36.350 --> 05:28:36.360 align:start position:0%
a simple internet search as well for
 
05:28:38.390 --> 05:28:38.400 align:start position:0%
tire manufacture dates results in
 
05:28:40.190 --> 05:28:40.200 align:start position:0%
countless links for tire manufacturers
 
05:28:42.470 --> 05:28:42.480 align:start position:0%
tire retailers and vehicle enthusiasts
 
05:28:45.830 --> 05:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
on how to identify a Tire's age and
 
05:28:48.170 --> 05:28:48.180 align:start position:0%
manufacture date
 
05:28:48.180 --> 05:28:49.430 align:start position:0%
manufacture date
second

05:28:49.430 --> 05:28:49.440 align:start position:0%
second
 
05:28:51.890 --> 05:28:51.900 align:start position:0%
the age and manufacture date of a tire
 
05:28:53.750 --> 05:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
is not the correct determination of the
 
05:28:56.330 --> 05:28:56.340 align:start position:0%
worthiness or safety status of a tire
 
05:28:59.690 --> 05:28:59.700 align:start position:0%
age could have a factor but Tire use is
 
05:29:02.570 --> 05:29:02.580 align:start position:0%
the single most important factor in the
 
05:29:04.670 --> 05:29:04.680 align:start position:0%
tire's life for example
 
05:29:06.050 --> 05:29:06.060 align:start position:0%
someone could have a well-kept
 
05:29:08.510 --> 05:29:08.520 align:start position:0%
automobile or trailer which with proper
 
05:29:10.490 --> 05:29:10.500 align:start position:0%
maintenance and storage could have tires
 
05:29:12.170 --> 05:29:12.180 align:start position:0%
which are decades old and are acceptable
 
05:29:13.730 --> 05:29:13.740 align:start position:0%
and safe to drive
 
05:29:15.948 --> 05:29:15.958 align:start position:0%
on the other hand a vehicle which is
 
05:29:18.470 --> 05:29:18.480 align:start position:0%
used quite often which is needs to be
 
05:29:21.470 --> 05:29:21.480 align:start position:0%
which is used quite often and is not
 
05:29:23.448 --> 05:29:23.458 align:start position:0%
well kept or stored may need to have the
 
05:29:25.430 --> 05:29:25.440 align:start position:0%
tires replaced within months
 
05:29:30.170 --> 05:29:30.180 align:start position:0%
Age Again is not the determining Factor
 
05:29:32.390 --> 05:29:32.400 align:start position:0%
for the tires worthiness and safety
 
05:29:34.970 --> 05:29:34.980 align:start position:0%
again Tire use is the critical piece
 
05:29:34.980 --> 05:29:36.470 align:start position:0%
again Tire use is the critical piece
here

05:29:36.470 --> 05:29:36.480 align:start position:0%
here
 
05:29:38.448 --> 05:29:38.458 align:start position:0%
um furthermore to answer a few other
 
05:29:40.610 --> 05:29:40.620 align:start position:0%
questions about blowouts and things like
 
05:29:42.590 --> 05:29:42.600 align:start position:0%
that I think a few of the members of the
 
05:29:44.330 --> 05:29:44.340 align:start position:0%
committee have brought this up but I'd
 
05:29:45.650 --> 05:29:45.660 align:start position:0%
like to bring it up too and another
 
05:29:47.750 --> 05:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
factor which is load
 
05:29:50.390 --> 05:29:50.400 align:start position:0%
um load is critical too so without
 
05:29:52.610 --> 05:29:52.620 align:start position:0%
knowing how the trailer was loaded the
 
05:29:54.288 --> 05:29:54.298 align:start position:0%
tires could have been properly inflated
 
05:29:57.230 --> 05:29:57.240 align:start position:0%
uh they could have had the proper PSI
 
05:29:58.910 --> 05:29:58.920 align:start position:0%
they might have been safe but again
 
05:30:00.650 --> 05:30:00.660 align:start position:0%
without knowing how the trailer was
 
05:30:02.690 --> 05:30:02.700 align:start position:0%
loaded that's a critical Factor here as
 
05:30:02.700 --> 05:30:03.530 align:start position:0%
loaded that's a critical Factor here as
well

05:30:03.530 --> 05:30:03.540 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:30:05.330 --> 05:30:05.340 align:start position:0%
so at that
 
05:30:07.368 --> 05:30:07.378 align:start position:0%
um like I said before I just like to ask
 
05:30:08.448 --> 05:30:08.458 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
05:30:11.270 --> 05:30:11.280 align:start position:0%
um to please uh not Advance the bill any
 
05:30:13.250 --> 05:30:13.260 align:start position:0%
further and I'm happy to take any
 
05:30:14.330 --> 05:30:14.340 align:start position:0%
questions that any of the committee
 
05:30:16.490 --> 05:30:16.500 align:start position:0%
members may have
 
05:30:18.050 --> 05:30:18.060 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
 
05:30:20.390 --> 05:30:20.400 align:start position:0%
committee representative sellers
 
05:30:22.970 --> 05:30:22.980 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh lucky me I bought
 
05:30:24.770 --> 05:30:24.780 align:start position:0%
an RV in this last year and I've
 
05:30:27.590 --> 05:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
researched the to the ends of the Earth
 
05:30:30.948 --> 05:30:30.958 align:start position:0%
on tires and I bought a DPMS just to
 
05:30:32.948 --> 05:30:32.958 align:start position:0%
make sure I know what the heat and
 
05:30:35.750 --> 05:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
temperature was and rating
 
05:30:37.490 --> 05:30:37.500 align:start position:0%
how would this
 
05:30:40.970 --> 05:30:40.980 align:start position:0%
Bill hurt the dealer or would it hurt
 
05:30:43.490 --> 05:30:43.500 align:start position:0%
the dealer at all just disclosing the
 
05:30:46.250 --> 05:30:46.260 align:start position:0%
information or saying the tire is X
 
05:30:48.170 --> 05:30:48.180 align:start position:0%
number years old
 
05:30:48.180 --> 05:30:49.250 align:start position:0%
number years old
sure

05:30:49.250 --> 05:30:49.260 align:start position:0%
sure
 
05:30:51.170 --> 05:30:51.180 align:start position:0%
um I could answer that question but I
 
05:30:52.850 --> 05:30:52.860 align:start position:0%
believe uh Mr Bennett from the New
 
05:30:54.288 --> 05:30:54.298 align:start position:0%
Hampshire automobile dealers will be
 
05:30:55.730 --> 05:30:55.740 align:start position:0%
coming up and I think he might be able
 
05:30:58.190 --> 05:30:58.200 align:start position:0%
to give you a better view of the dealer
 
05:30:59.868 --> 05:30:59.878 align:start position:0%
point of view when it comes to this I
 
05:31:02.930 --> 05:31:02.940 align:start position:0%
represent the manufacturing base and of
 
05:31:05.930 --> 05:31:05.940 align:start position:0%
of the RV industry
 
05:31:08.390 --> 05:31:08.400 align:start position:0%
follow-up thank you Mr chair
 
05:31:12.050 --> 05:31:12.060 align:start position:0%
typically RVs are also used very seldom
 
05:31:14.868 --> 05:31:14.878 align:start position:0%
I mean six eight 12 weeks a year and
 
05:31:16.490 --> 05:31:16.500 align:start position:0%
then they're sitting around so there's
 
05:31:18.288 --> 05:31:18.298 align:start position:0%
not that it is getting used like you're
 
05:31:21.288 --> 05:31:21.298 align:start position:0%
thinking of a utility trailer possibly
 
05:31:23.690 --> 05:31:23.700 align:start position:0%
so there's a combination that's going on
 
05:31:26.930 --> 05:31:26.940 align:start position:0%
here how would you I don't know if
 
05:31:28.730 --> 05:31:28.740 align:start position:0%
there's a way to determine that you know
 
05:31:31.190 --> 05:31:31.200 align:start position:0%
because there is no inspection on RVs
 
05:31:32.990 --> 05:31:33.000 align:start position:0%
do you have any ideas
 
05:31:35.150 --> 05:31:35.160 align:start position:0%
sure so first and foremost we support
 
05:31:38.270 --> 05:31:38.280 align:start position:0%
inspections on RVs when it comes down to
 
05:31:39.948 --> 05:31:39.958 align:start position:0%
that so you know the safety of the
 
05:31:42.530 --> 05:31:42.540 align:start position:0%
consumer is Paramount when it comes to
 
05:31:46.490 --> 05:31:46.500 align:start position:0%
us in speaking to the other Point RV use
 
05:31:48.288 --> 05:31:48.298 align:start position:0%
is going up more and more
 
05:31:50.690 --> 05:31:50.700 align:start position:0%
um every single year as we've gone to a
 
05:31:52.070 --> 05:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
remote work system throughout the
 
05:31:54.410 --> 05:31:54.420 align:start position:0%
country more and more consumers are
 
05:31:56.448 --> 05:31:56.458 align:start position:0%
actually using their RVs on a weekly
 
05:31:58.970 --> 05:31:58.980 align:start position:0%
basis there are more consumers who like
 
05:32:00.708 --> 05:32:00.718 align:start position:0%
to call themselves full-timers who will
 
05:32:03.530 --> 05:32:03.540 align:start position:0%
go around the country and use the
 
05:32:06.890 --> 05:32:06.900 align:start position:0%
vehicle you know quite often so there
 
05:32:08.270 --> 05:32:08.280 align:start position:0%
there's a little bit of everything and
 
05:32:10.010 --> 05:32:10.020 align:start position:0%
again that's why use is the critical
 
05:32:10.020 --> 05:32:12.230 align:start position:0%
again that's why use is the critical
piece

05:32:12.230 --> 05:32:12.240 align:start position:0%
piece
 
05:32:15.050 --> 05:32:15.060 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative
 
05:32:16.850 --> 05:32:16.860 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
05:32:18.530 --> 05:32:18.540 align:start position:0%
taking my question um tires that are
 
05:32:19.910 --> 05:32:19.920 align:start position:0%
eight to nine years old that show very
 
05:32:22.670 --> 05:32:22.680 align:start position:0%
little tread wear obviously weren't used
 
05:32:24.110 --> 05:32:24.120 align:start position:0%
regularly what is the ethical
 
05:32:25.910 --> 05:32:25.920 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the dealership to
 
05:32:28.128 --> 05:32:28.138 align:start position:0%
disclose the potential safety issues or
 
05:32:30.890 --> 05:32:30.900 align:start position:0%
to take responsibility for those issues
 
05:32:33.410 --> 05:32:33.420 align:start position:0%
sure again I represent the manufacturer
 
05:32:35.570 --> 05:32:35.580 align:start position:0%
so I think the dealers would have to
 
05:32:38.570 --> 05:32:38.580 align:start position:0%
answer that properly what I would say is
 
05:32:40.310 --> 05:32:40.320 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:32:43.310 --> 05:32:43.320 align:start position:0%
I don't I've never heard of an interior
 
05:32:46.190 --> 05:32:46.200 align:start position:0%
Tire inspection throughout my career in
 
05:32:48.470 --> 05:32:48.480 align:start position:0%
the the automotive industry I think that
 
05:32:49.970 --> 05:32:49.980 align:start position:0%
would be quite hard and quite labor
 
05:32:54.050 --> 05:32:54.060 align:start position:0%
intensive for an inspector to do so the
 
05:32:55.670 --> 05:32:55.680 align:start position:0%
only thing that the inspector has to go
 
05:32:57.890 --> 05:32:57.900 align:start position:0%
by is going to be what they can see on
 
05:33:02.448 --> 05:33:02.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:05.690 --> 05:33:05.700 align:start position:0%
and Dan Bennett is signed up to speak so
 
05:33:07.190 --> 05:33:07.200 align:start position:0%
if you have any of those questions you
 
05:33:08.990 --> 05:33:09.000 align:start position:0%
will have an opportunity any other
 
05:33:11.150 --> 05:33:11.160 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
05:33:17.330 --> 05:33:17.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:19.368 --> 05:33:19.378 align:start position:0%
well speaking of that chair recognizes
 
05:33:21.590 --> 05:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
Dan Bennett representative uh who is
 
05:33:24.170 --> 05:33:24.180 align:start position:0%
opposed to the bill
 
05:33:26.628 --> 05:33:26.638 align:start position:0%
um looking for three minutes
 
05:33:28.310 --> 05:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
representing the New Hampshire Auto
 
05:33:33.288 --> 05:33:33.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:35.150 --> 05:33:35.160 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
05:33:37.490 --> 05:33:37.500 align:start position:0%
committee uh once again I'm Dan Bennett
 
05:33:38.510 --> 05:33:38.520 align:start position:0%
from the New Hampshire Auto Dealers
 
05:33:40.490 --> 05:33:40.500 align:start position:0%
Association you've had three bills and
 
05:33:42.410 --> 05:33:42.420 align:start position:0%
you've heard from me twice so I have a
 
05:33:43.550 --> 05:33:43.560 align:start position:0%
feeling we're going to get to be very
 
05:33:44.868 --> 05:33:44.878 align:start position:0%
good friends
 
05:33:47.448 --> 05:33:47.458 align:start position:0%
um at the break I did hand out a fact
 
05:33:48.948 --> 05:33:48.958 align:start position:0%
sheet that we have that has all of my
 
05:33:50.628 --> 05:33:50.638 align:start position:0%
contact info as
 
05:33:52.610 --> 05:33:52.620 align:start position:0%
um promised earlier as well so
 
05:33:54.050 --> 05:33:54.060 align:start position:0%
um with that I'll begin
 
05:33:57.050 --> 05:33:57.060 align:start position:0%
um we uh we opposed this particular Bill
 
05:34:00.288 --> 05:34:00.298 align:start position:0%
HP 132 I'm sorry for the unfortunate
 
05:34:02.750 --> 05:34:02.760 align:start position:0%
experience that the representatives had
 
05:34:04.910 --> 05:34:04.920 align:start position:0%
um but unfortunately and respectfully we
 
05:34:06.530 --> 05:34:06.540 align:start position:0%
do in fact oppose it
 
05:34:09.230 --> 05:34:09.240 align:start position:0%
um okay what I can do is recommend some
 
05:34:11.270 --> 05:34:11.280 align:start position:0%
very reputable trailer dealers in the
 
05:34:13.368 --> 05:34:13.378 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire that are both
 
05:34:15.770 --> 05:34:15.780 align:start position:0%
nhada members and licensed by the New
 
05:34:17.930 --> 05:34:17.940 align:start position:0%
Hampshire DMV so we can talk about that
 
05:34:17.940 --> 05:34:19.070 align:start position:0%
Hampshire DMV so we can talk about that
offline

05:34:19.070 --> 05:34:19.080 align:start position:0%
offline
 
05:34:20.930 --> 05:34:20.940 align:start position:0%
um date of birth does not indicate
 
05:34:20.940 --> 05:34:22.190 align:start position:0%
um date of birth does not indicate
condition

05:34:22.190 --> 05:34:22.200 align:start position:0%
condition
 
05:34:22.200 --> 05:34:22.788 align:start position:0%
condition
um

05:34:22.788 --> 05:34:22.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:34:24.770 --> 05:34:24.780 align:start position:0%
I'm in much better shape than some of my
 
05:34:26.750 --> 05:34:26.760 align:start position:0%
friends my age and I am in much worse
 
05:34:28.190 --> 05:34:28.200 align:start position:0%
shape than some of my friends of my age
 
05:34:30.350 --> 05:34:30.360 align:start position:0%
it's about use it's wear and tear it's
 
05:34:32.448 --> 05:34:32.458 align:start position:0%
ours it's a mechanical piece of
 
05:34:34.368 --> 05:34:34.378 align:start position:0%
equipment so
 
05:34:36.708 --> 05:34:36.718 align:start position:0%
um it's uh it's why we look at mileage
 
05:34:39.830 --> 05:34:39.840 align:start position:0%
or on a vehicle or hours on an engine in
 
05:34:42.708 --> 05:34:42.718 align:start position:0%
the case of snowmobiles or ATVs so it
 
05:34:45.230 --> 05:34:45.240 align:start position:0%
really does come down to use blown tires
 
05:34:47.770 --> 05:34:47.780 align:start position:0%
can happen for a multitude of reasons
 
05:34:49.970 --> 05:34:49.980 align:start position:0%
with this bill
 
05:34:51.890 --> 05:34:51.900 align:start position:0%
um like one that I mentioned earlier I I
 
05:34:53.330 --> 05:34:53.340 align:start position:0%
don't know how this bill will be
 
05:34:56.868 --> 05:34:56.878 align:start position:0%
enforced uh who's gonna but visit a
 
05:34:59.208 --> 05:34:59.218 align:start position:0%
dealership and uh trailer dealership and
 
05:35:00.590 --> 05:35:00.600 align:start position:0%
rip through every deal jacket to make
 
05:35:02.930 --> 05:35:02.940 align:start position:0%
sure that this disclosure was and is or
 
05:35:02.940 --> 05:35:04.208 align:start position:0%
sure that this disclosure was and is or
given

05:35:04.208 --> 05:35:04.218 align:start position:0%
given
 
05:35:08.150 --> 05:35:08.160 align:start position:0%
so that's an issue if a consumer has
 
05:35:10.490 --> 05:35:10.500 align:start position:0%
questions about equipment condition they
 
05:35:13.368 --> 05:35:13.378 align:start position:0%
can always visit a reputable dealer or
 
05:35:16.510 --> 05:35:16.520 align:start position:0%
technician and have equipment inspected
 
05:35:18.890 --> 05:35:18.900 align:start position:0%
it's just like getting a second opinion
 
05:35:21.708 --> 05:35:21.718 align:start position:0%
from your doctor so you can always uh
 
05:35:24.310 --> 05:35:24.320 align:start position:0%
you can always get a second opinion
 
05:35:27.830 --> 05:35:27.840 align:start position:0%
we do encourage periodic review of
 
05:35:30.170 --> 05:35:30.180 align:start position:0%
inspection especially during a busy busy
 
05:35:32.390 --> 05:35:32.400 align:start position:0%
trailer season and especially at the
 
05:35:34.970 --> 05:35:34.980 align:start position:0%
start of season when you dust off that
 
05:35:36.890 --> 05:35:36.900 align:start position:0%
trailer and right before you put it away
 
05:35:38.390 --> 05:35:38.400 align:start position:0%
there's some preventative maintenance
 
05:35:41.330 --> 05:35:41.340 align:start position:0%
things you can do dealers actually sell
 
05:35:43.310 --> 05:35:43.320 align:start position:0%
bags you can see them on campers some
 
05:35:44.750 --> 05:35:44.760 align:start position:0%
campers for their winter storage get
 
05:35:46.610 --> 05:35:46.620 align:start position:0%
completely covered some folks put them
 
05:35:48.708 --> 05:35:48.718 align:start position:0%
up off the ground and some folks put
 
05:35:50.570 --> 05:35:50.580 align:start position:0%
protective bags really around the tire
 
05:35:53.868 --> 05:35:53.878 align:start position:0%
to prevent dry rot and also an instance
 
05:35:55.910 --> 05:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
that I mentioned earlier rodent
 
05:35:58.550 --> 05:35:58.560 align:start position:0%
deterioration so those are things that
 
05:36:01.368 --> 05:36:01.378 align:start position:0%
we all recommend when it comes to the
 
05:36:03.948 --> 05:36:03.958 align:start position:0%
disclosure component
 
05:36:03.958 --> 05:36:04.570 align:start position:0%
disclosure component
um

05:36:04.570 --> 05:36:04.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:36:07.550 --> 05:36:07.560 align:start position:0%
vehicle per the vehicle purchase process
 
05:36:10.310 --> 05:36:10.320 align:start position:0%
is a very uh paperwork document
 
05:36:14.628 --> 05:36:14.638 align:start position:0%
disclosure heavy transaction okay it's
 
05:36:16.850 --> 05:36:16.860 align:start position:0%
not as heavy as buying a house right
 
05:36:18.288 --> 05:36:18.298 align:start position:0%
where the stack of paper is this high
 
05:36:20.810 --> 05:36:20.820 align:start position:0%
but there's a lot of papers in a in a
 
05:36:22.970 --> 05:36:22.980 align:start position:0%
vehicle deal right so every time we add
 
05:36:25.250 --> 05:36:25.260 align:start position:0%
another piece of paper it tends to
 
05:36:25.260 --> 05:36:26.270 align:start position:0%
another piece of paper it tends to
diminish

05:36:26.270 --> 05:36:26.280 align:start position:0%
diminish
 
05:36:28.368 --> 05:36:28.378 align:start position:0%
the importance of the others because
 
05:36:30.110 --> 05:36:30.120 align:start position:0%
then that's why that's why it's called
 
05:36:31.910 --> 05:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
passing papers right we start shuffling
 
05:36:35.330 --> 05:36:35.340 align:start position:0%
and some of those documents tend to lose
 
05:36:38.270 --> 05:36:38.280 align:start position:0%
their importance when we make it too
 
05:36:40.310 --> 05:36:40.320 align:start position:0%
heavy so I I caution
 
05:36:42.708 --> 05:36:42.718 align:start position:0%
um about the paperwork intensiveness and
 
05:36:44.810 --> 05:36:44.820 align:start position:0%
the document disclosure component
 
05:36:46.910 --> 05:36:46.920 align:start position:0%
um just as a point um we are sensitive
 
05:36:49.490 --> 05:36:49.500 align:start position:0%
to you know other documents getting
 
05:36:50.868 --> 05:36:50.878 align:start position:0%
watered down
 
05:36:54.170 --> 05:36:54.180 align:start position:0%
um this isn't an inspection bill
 
05:36:57.410 --> 05:36:57.420 align:start position:0%
we support inspections we always have we
 
05:36:59.868 --> 05:36:59.878 align:start position:0%
supported trailer inspections even when
 
05:37:02.448 --> 05:37:02.458 align:start position:0%
the legislature opposed or removed we
 
05:37:04.670 --> 05:37:04.680 align:start position:0%
used to have trailer inspections and
 
05:37:05.990 --> 05:37:06.000 align:start position:0%
then a few years ago the legislature
 
05:37:07.910 --> 05:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
decided that anything under 10 000 GVW
 
05:37:09.590 --> 05:37:09.600 align:start position:0%
for a trailer will no longer be
 
05:37:09.600 --> 05:37:11.030 align:start position:0%
for a trailer will no longer be
inspected

05:37:11.030 --> 05:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
inspected
 
05:37:14.570 --> 05:37:14.580 align:start position:0%
um we weren't supportive of that but
 
05:37:16.310 --> 05:37:16.320 align:start position:0%
this is a date of birth disclosure bill
 
05:37:18.350 --> 05:37:18.360 align:start position:0%
that's not a it's not a trailer
 
05:37:20.750 --> 05:37:20.760 align:start position:0%
inspection Bill trailer Inspections just
 
05:37:22.070 --> 05:37:22.080 align:start position:0%
to the point that was mentioned earlier
 
05:37:24.170 --> 05:37:24.180 align:start position:0%
trailer inspections cover a lot of
 
05:37:26.330 --> 05:37:26.340 align:start position:0%
things trailer inspections do cover
 
05:37:30.230 --> 05:37:30.240 align:start position:0%
tires but they cover surface issues it's
 
05:37:32.030 --> 05:37:32.040 align:start position:0%
not internal the tire isn't removed the
 
05:37:34.310 --> 05:37:34.320 align:start position:0%
inside isn't scoured it's an it's an
 
05:37:37.490 --> 05:37:37.500 align:start position:0%
external review for cuts tears scratches
 
05:37:40.190 --> 05:37:40.200 align:start position:0%
wires showing and importantly tread
 
05:37:42.368 --> 05:37:42.378 align:start position:0%
depth with it with a tread depth gauge
 
05:37:45.590 --> 05:37:45.600 align:start position:0%
that's what's inspected at a on a tire
 
05:37:47.510 --> 05:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
but in a trailer inspection there's a
 
05:37:49.788 --> 05:37:49.798 align:start position:0%
whole host of other things the hitch the
 
05:37:53.208 --> 05:37:53.218 align:start position:0%
wiring the turn signals the brake lights
 
05:37:55.850 --> 05:37:55.860 align:start position:0%
the the hubs
 
05:37:58.070 --> 05:37:58.080 align:start position:0%
um you know there's any Flex Points you
 
05:37:59.628 --> 05:37:59.638 align:start position:0%
know being properly greased so there's a
 
05:38:01.070 --> 05:38:01.080 align:start position:0%
whole host of things that do in fact go
 
05:38:02.628 --> 05:38:02.638 align:start position:0%
into a trailer inspection it's not just
 
05:38:04.070 --> 05:38:04.080 align:start position:0%
looking at tires
 
05:38:05.510 --> 05:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
um so
 
05:38:06.890 --> 05:38:06.900 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to mention those few
 
05:38:09.230 --> 05:38:09.240 align:start position:0%
things again I sympathize and I'm sorry
 
05:38:11.270 --> 05:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
to hear about the sponsor's experience
 
05:38:14.690 --> 05:38:14.700 align:start position:0%
I'm glad to hear that um that it was
 
05:38:17.090 --> 05:38:17.100 align:start position:0%
that nothing bad happened that it was
 
05:38:18.590 --> 05:38:18.600 align:start position:0%
safely resolved
 
05:38:20.270 --> 05:38:20.280 align:start position:0%
um but unfortunately
 
05:38:22.010 --> 05:38:22.020 align:start position:0%
um I don't think this particular piece
 
05:38:23.570 --> 05:38:23.580 align:start position:0%
of legislation
 
05:38:26.208 --> 05:38:26.218 align:start position:0%
um is the correct solution
 
05:38:28.788 --> 05:38:28.798 align:start position:0%
um for a blowout on the highway that can
 
05:38:31.550 --> 05:38:31.560 align:start position:0%
happen for a multitude of reasons so
 
05:38:34.010 --> 05:38:34.020 align:start position:0%
um thank you and thanks for the time
 
05:38:36.110 --> 05:38:36.120 align:start position:0%
um and I'll take any questions uh if
 
05:38:39.350 --> 05:38:39.360 align:start position:0%
there are some I did uh I did hear a few
 
05:38:42.350 --> 05:38:42.360 align:start position:0%
earlier that I may be able to address
 
05:38:44.030 --> 05:38:44.040 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
 
05:38:45.470 --> 05:38:45.480 align:start position:0%
committee did you did you want your
 
05:38:47.150 --> 05:38:47.160 align:start position:0%
answer representative sellers
 
05:38:49.670 --> 05:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you chairman
 
05:38:52.310 --> 05:38:52.320 align:start position:0%
um again the question is yeah it's
 
05:38:54.288 --> 05:38:54.298 align:start position:0%
another piece of paper you're right and
 
05:38:55.550 --> 05:38:55.560 align:start position:0%
you don't want to diminish the pieces of
 
05:38:56.448 --> 05:38:56.458 align:start position:0%
the paper
 
05:38:58.208 --> 05:38:58.218 align:start position:0%
but for a person
 
05:39:01.310 --> 05:39:01.320 align:start position:0%
buying a trailer we know nothing and
 
05:39:03.650 --> 05:39:03.660 align:start position:0%
they know nothing and and so at least
 
05:39:05.570 --> 05:39:05.580 align:start position:0%
getting to the age of the tire
 
05:39:08.390 --> 05:39:08.400 align:start position:0%
you've got date code giving him up front
 
05:39:10.610 --> 05:39:10.620 align:start position:0%
at least they know how old it is if they
 
05:39:12.890 --> 05:39:12.900 align:start position:0%
have an 86 or any e or Tire on there why
 
05:39:14.990 --> 05:39:15.000 align:start position:0%
why do one just tell them
 
05:39:19.128 --> 05:39:19.138 align:start position:0%
and and or recommended should be changed
 
05:39:22.128 --> 05:39:22.138 align:start position:0%
just document it why what's what would
 
05:39:23.990 --> 05:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
be the cost of the dealership just doing
 
05:39:24.000 --> 05:39:26.448 align:start position:0%
be the cost of the dealership just doing
that

05:39:26.448 --> 05:39:26.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:29.270 --> 05:39:29.280 align:start position:0%
okay so my response is so I guess we
 
05:39:30.770 --> 05:39:30.780 align:start position:0%
could expand that too I don't know a
 
05:39:32.390 --> 05:39:32.400 align:start position:0%
whole lot about my bicycle should we
 
05:39:34.430 --> 05:39:34.440 align:start position:0%
have Tire disclosures for bicycles or
 
05:39:36.170 --> 05:39:36.180 align:start position:0%
washing machines or any mechanical piece
 
05:39:37.490 --> 05:39:37.500 align:start position:0%
of equipment
 
05:39:40.368 --> 05:39:40.378 align:start position:0%
um but with this one so if they do
 
05:39:42.350 --> 05:39:42.360 align:start position:0%
properly disclose it does it then make
 
05:39:44.448 --> 05:39:44.458 align:start position:0%
the the dealer liable for something that
 
05:39:46.610 --> 05:39:46.620 align:start position:0%
was totally out of their hands like hot
 
05:39:50.390 --> 05:39:50.400 align:start position:0%
roads or over over usage or nails or bad
 
05:39:53.330 --> 05:39:53.340 align:start position:0%
driving they scuff curbs so you
 
05:39:55.730 --> 05:39:55.740 align:start position:0%
potentially open them for liability I
 
05:39:57.288 --> 05:39:57.298 align:start position:0%
don't know see anything in this that
 
05:39:59.330 --> 05:39:59.340 align:start position:0%
would release liability if the
 
05:40:01.788 --> 05:40:01.798 align:start position:0%
disclosure is in fact issued so that's
 
05:40:03.470 --> 05:40:03.480 align:start position:0%
one potential
 
05:40:05.690 --> 05:40:05.700 align:start position:0%
um you may be requiring the technician
 
05:40:07.670 --> 05:40:07.680 align:start position:0%
to make a use or a judgment call
 
05:40:10.190 --> 05:40:10.200 align:start position:0%
did it pass on this snapshot in time or
 
05:40:11.510 --> 05:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
are you asking me as a technician to
 
05:40:14.810 --> 05:40:14.820 align:start position:0%
project whether this will last for 12
 
05:40:17.868 --> 05:40:17.878 align:start position:0%
months or six months or 6 000 miles or
 
05:40:22.128 --> 05:40:22.138 align:start position:0%
60 000 miles and then even with Tire
 
05:40:23.990 --> 05:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
inspections as mentioned before Tire
 
05:40:26.470 --> 05:40:26.480 align:start position:0%
inspections do not require
 
05:40:31.010 --> 05:40:31.020 align:start position:0%
internal inspections removal
 
05:40:33.948 --> 05:40:33.958 align:start position:0%
um you know Rim from Tire inside type
 
05:40:35.270 --> 05:40:35.280 align:start position:0%
stuff so
 
05:40:38.448 --> 05:40:38.458 align:start position:0%
um and if it did that would certainly be
 
05:40:41.150 --> 05:40:41.160 align:start position:0%
a tremendous addition of time to an
 
05:40:42.770 --> 05:40:42.780 align:start position:0%
inspection which would in fact raise
 
05:40:42.780 --> 05:40:43.730 align:start position:0%
inspection which would in fact raise
cost

05:40:43.730 --> 05:40:43.740 align:start position:0%
cost
 
05:40:45.410 --> 05:40:45.420 align:start position:0%
so I think those are things that a
 
05:40:48.770 --> 05:40:48.780 align:start position:0%
dealer would be sensitive to
 
05:40:51.110 --> 05:40:51.120 align:start position:0%
so just a few thoughts
 
05:40:53.270 --> 05:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
um if there's anything for the questions
 
05:40:54.948 --> 05:40:54.958 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:40:59.448 --> 05:40:59.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:02.030 --> 05:41:02.040 align:start position:0%
uh next up Lieutenant O'Leary from New
 
05:41:04.490 --> 05:41:04.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire State Police uh not taking a
 
05:41:06.830 --> 05:41:06.840 align:start position:0%
position on the bill looking for five
 
05:41:06.840 --> 05:41:14.030 align:start position:0%
position on the bill looking for five
minutes

05:41:14.030 --> 05:41:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:15.890 --> 05:41:15.900 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair members of the
 
05:41:17.570 --> 05:41:17.580 align:start position:0%
committee really appreciate a chair they
 
05:41:19.730 --> 05:41:19.740 align:start position:0%
didn't have sides on it
 
05:41:19.740 --> 05:41:20.690 align:start position:0%
didn't have sides on it
um

05:41:20.690 --> 05:41:20.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:41:23.628 --> 05:41:23.638 align:start position:0%
so just as a another consideration
 
05:41:25.368 --> 05:41:25.378 align:start position:0%
regarding enforcement with this uh
 
05:41:27.170 --> 05:41:27.180 align:start position:0%
proposed language
 
05:41:30.910 --> 05:41:30.920 align:start position:0%
the way that I see this under RSA
 
05:41:34.490 --> 05:41:34.500 align:start position:0%
26653 or in the 266 section section
 
05:41:37.430 --> 05:41:37.440 align:start position:0%
itself that section of law
 
05:41:39.288 --> 05:41:39.298 align:start position:0%
um basically outlines the equipment
 
05:41:41.930 --> 05:41:41.940 align:start position:0%
that's uh on vehicles so that's what our
 
05:41:43.970 --> 05:41:43.980 align:start position:0%
state inspectors use when they conduct a
 
05:41:46.310 --> 05:41:46.320 align:start position:0%
state inspection as a guideline for
 
05:41:49.010 --> 05:41:49.020 align:start position:0%
whether or not a vehicle meets the
 
05:41:52.550 --> 05:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
requirements so as on our end as fire
 
05:41:54.170 --> 05:41:54.180 align:start position:0%
State Police is concerned if we're going
 
05:41:57.110 --> 05:41:57.120 align:start position:0%
to enforce this if this this uh moves
 
05:41:57.120 --> 05:41:58.550 align:start position:0%
to enforce this if this this uh moves
forward

05:41:58.550 --> 05:41:58.560 align:start position:0%
forward
 
05:42:00.110 --> 05:42:00.120 align:start position:0%
um I guess we would just need some
 
05:42:03.708 --> 05:42:03.718 align:start position:0%
clarification as most of our
 
05:42:07.128 --> 05:42:07.138 align:start position:0%
Motor Vehicle Dealer laws fall under the
 
05:42:10.128 --> 05:42:10.138 align:start position:0%
261 section and that's where essentially
 
05:42:12.430 --> 05:42:12.440 align:start position:0%
where we have a lot of our requirements
 
05:42:14.750 --> 05:42:14.760 align:start position:0%
that the dealers have to you know give
 
05:42:16.610 --> 05:42:16.620 align:start position:0%
certain things temporary plates odometer
 
05:42:18.350 --> 05:42:18.360 align:start position:0%
statements and things like that so when
 
05:42:20.448 --> 05:42:20.458 align:start position:0%
our crew goes in to do an audit at a
 
05:42:22.128 --> 05:42:22.138 align:start position:0%
dealership if they're missing that
 
05:42:23.868 --> 05:42:23.878 align:start position:0%
document then that's something that we
 
05:42:25.730 --> 05:42:25.740 align:start position:0%
can address you know administratively
 
05:42:29.690 --> 05:42:29.700 align:start position:0%
the way that this is written it my
 
05:42:32.050 --> 05:42:32.060 align:start position:0%
perception is that this would fall on
 
05:42:36.170 --> 05:42:36.180 align:start position:0%
safety mechanics to ensure that that's
 
05:42:38.208 --> 05:42:38.218 align:start position:0%
um you know in check so we just want to
 
05:42:39.288 --> 05:42:39.298 align:start position:0%
make sure we put it under the right
 
05:42:40.910 --> 05:42:40.920 align:start position:0%
section of law if this does move forward
 
05:42:42.890 --> 05:42:42.900 align:start position:0%
would be my request because the
 
05:42:45.170 --> 05:42:45.180 align:start position:0%
enforcement part would be a second of
 
05:42:46.490 --> 05:42:46.500 align:start position:0%
that you know is this going to be a
 
05:42:48.050 --> 05:42:48.060 align:start position:0%
criminal law which we're going to
 
05:42:50.270 --> 05:42:50.280 align:start position:0%
essentially arrest somebody for if they
 
05:42:53.030 --> 05:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
do not comply with it or is this going
 
05:42:54.590 --> 05:42:54.600 align:start position:0%
to be another document that we're just
 
05:42:56.150 --> 05:42:56.160 align:start position:0%
checking for when we conduct an audience
 
05:42:59.208 --> 05:42:59.218 align:start position:0%
sorry an audit to ensure that the dealer
 
05:43:02.570 --> 05:43:02.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:04.010 --> 05:43:04.020 align:start position:0%
um and lastly if it does move forward
 
05:43:06.410 --> 05:43:06.420 align:start position:0%
our other request would be that
 
05:43:08.270 --> 05:43:08.280 align:start position:0%
um where it talks about the tire age and
 
05:43:10.128 --> 05:43:10.138 align:start position:0%
date of manufacturer we just ask that
 
05:43:12.410 --> 05:43:12.420 align:start position:0%
that would be in clear language because
 
05:43:14.150 --> 05:43:14.160 align:start position:0%
sometimes what happens is exactly what
 
05:43:15.650 --> 05:43:15.660 align:start position:0%
would happen here potentially you could
 
05:43:17.030 --> 05:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
have a dealer that would write the
 
05:43:18.708 --> 05:43:18.718 align:start position:0%
numbers or letters that correspond with
 
05:43:20.750 --> 05:43:20.760 align:start position:0%
it leaving up to the buyer to determine
 
05:43:22.788 --> 05:43:22.798 align:start position:0%
what any of that means so we would just
 
05:43:25.010 --> 05:43:25.020 align:start position:0%
ask that the language be clear and what
 
05:43:27.830 --> 05:43:27.840 align:start position:0%
that the age of the tire is that's all I
 
05:43:28.670 --> 05:43:28.680 align:start position:0%
have sir
 
05:43:31.430 --> 05:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
thank you questions from representative
 
05:43:31.440 --> 05:43:32.868 align:start position:0%
thank you questions from representative
sakes

05:43:32.868 --> 05:43:32.878 align:start position:0%
sakes
 
05:43:35.150 --> 05:43:35.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh Lieutenant
 
05:43:35.160 --> 05:43:36.110 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh Lieutenant
O'Leary

05:43:36.110 --> 05:43:36.120 align:start position:0%
O'Leary
 
05:43:38.510 --> 05:43:38.520 align:start position:0%
is this the kind of
 
05:43:40.430 --> 05:43:40.440 align:start position:0%
for lack of a better term regulation
 
05:43:42.288 --> 05:43:42.298 align:start position:0%
that might be better
 
05:43:44.510 --> 05:43:44.520 align:start position:0%
dealt with in rules rather than in
 
05:43:44.520 --> 05:43:46.310 align:start position:0%
dealt with in rules rather than in
legislation

05:43:46.310 --> 05:43:46.320 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
05:43:48.288 --> 05:43:48.298 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for your question sir I'm
 
05:43:50.330 --> 05:43:50.340 align:start position:0%
currently what we have in administrative
 
05:43:53.090 --> 05:43:53.100 align:start position:0%
rules as members before me have spoken
 
05:43:55.070 --> 05:43:55.080 align:start position:0%
to you know is that visual inspection of
 
05:43:57.830 --> 05:43:57.840 align:start position:0%
tires I don't know that we could get any
 
05:43:59.510 --> 05:43:59.520 align:start position:0%
you know um
 
05:44:01.430 --> 05:44:01.440 align:start position:0%
any more strict on how tires are
 
05:44:02.810 --> 05:44:02.820 align:start position:0%
inspected other than what we have right
 
05:44:04.910 --> 05:44:04.920 align:start position:0%
now other than again like Mr Bennett
 
05:44:06.470 --> 05:44:06.480 align:start position:0%
alluded to taking the tire right off the
 
05:44:07.610 --> 05:44:07.620 align:start position:0%
rim but even then it's going to be
 
05:44:10.070 --> 05:44:10.080 align:start position:0%
difficult to to determine so
 
05:44:13.430 --> 05:44:13.440 align:start position:0%
administrative rule uh through that 261
 
05:44:15.350 --> 05:44:15.360 align:start position:0%
law we could we could probably get it in
 
05:44:17.448 --> 05:44:17.458 align:start position:0%
administrative rule that way but outside
 
05:44:19.310 --> 05:44:19.320 align:start position:0%
of that with our current inspection
 
05:44:21.530 --> 05:44:21.540 align:start position:0%
rules that it's not a I don't think a
 
05:44:23.750 --> 05:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
good fit
 
05:44:25.730 --> 05:44:25.740 align:start position:0%
yes sir thank you for your question for
 
05:44:29.628 --> 05:44:29.638 align:start position:0%
the questions representative Sinclair
 
05:44:31.610 --> 05:44:31.620 align:start position:0%
instead of a whole another sheet of
 
05:44:33.410 --> 05:44:33.420 align:start position:0%
paper wouldn't it just to be as easy to
 
05:44:35.448 --> 05:44:35.458 align:start position:0%
just have one little line that says age
 
05:44:38.390 --> 05:44:38.400 align:start position:0%
of tires and
 
05:44:40.730 --> 05:44:40.740 align:start position:0%
um that would give I mean I'm going to
 
05:44:42.350 --> 05:44:42.360 align:start position:0%
look at a tire just to look at what it
 
05:44:44.330 --> 05:44:44.340 align:start position:0%
looks like and if I guess if it's 10
 
05:44:46.430 --> 05:44:46.440 align:start position:0%
years old then I can think about it but
 
05:44:48.708 --> 05:44:48.718 align:start position:0%
at least it would give the consumer just
 
05:44:50.390 --> 05:44:50.400 align:start position:0%
another little bit of information and
 
05:44:51.948 --> 05:44:51.958 align:start position:0%
then if they want to freak out about the
 
05:44:54.170 --> 05:44:54.180 align:start position:0%
age they can still freak out about it or
 
05:44:56.270 --> 05:44:56.280 align:start position:0%
not it would be up to them but just just
 
05:44:58.368 --> 05:44:58.378 align:start position:0%
a little line
 
05:45:00.350 --> 05:45:00.360 align:start position:0%
thank you representative I I don't want
 
05:45:01.730 --> 05:45:01.740 align:start position:0%
to speak on behalf of the the bill
 
05:45:03.948 --> 05:45:03.958 align:start position:0%
sponsors but I assume based on what I've
 
05:45:06.170 --> 05:45:06.180 align:start position:0%
seen um you know with car sales as the
 
05:45:08.030 --> 05:45:08.040 align:start position:0%
paperwork is required now the reason why
 
05:45:10.310 --> 05:45:10.320 align:start position:0%
the odometer statement is is a separate
 
05:45:11.990 --> 05:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
statement it is to you know put more
 
05:45:14.750 --> 05:45:14.760 align:start position:0%
emphasis on that so adding a adding a
 
05:45:15.948 --> 05:45:15.958 align:start position:0%
line somewhere
 
05:45:17.690 --> 05:45:17.700 align:start position:0%
um I'm thinking that their thought is it
 
05:45:19.250 --> 05:45:19.260 align:start position:0%
would be Lost in Translation and they're
 
05:45:21.470 --> 05:45:21.480 align:start position:0%
looking for to put emphasis on this this
 
05:45:24.230 --> 05:45:24.240 align:start position:0%
item all right thank you thank you so
 
05:45:26.208 --> 05:45:26.218 align:start position:0%
for the questions
 
05:45:28.010 --> 05:45:28.020 align:start position:0%
I'm just seeing that I just have one
 
05:45:31.610 --> 05:45:31.620 align:start position:0%
just just to to clarify so intercurrent
 
05:45:34.850 --> 05:45:34.860 align:start position:0%
inspection laws the date that's stamped
 
05:45:37.910 --> 05:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
on there the week in the year is not by
 
05:45:40.190 --> 05:45:40.200 align:start position:0%
itself enough to fail a tire it's all
 
05:45:42.048 --> 05:45:42.058 align:start position:0%
based on physical
 
05:45:47.208 --> 05:45:47.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:49.368 --> 05:45:49.378 align:start position:0%
any other questions thanks again thank
 
05:45:49.378 --> 05:45:50.990 align:start position:0%
any other questions thanks again thank
you

05:45:50.990 --> 05:45:51.000 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:45:54.110 --> 05:45:54.120 align:start position:0%
that is the last person I have signed up
 
05:45:55.310 --> 05:45:55.320 align:start position:0%
to speak so I'm going to close the
 
05:45:58.490 --> 05:45:58.500 align:start position:0%
public hearing on House Bill 132. uh
 
05:45:59.750 --> 05:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
next up
 
05:46:04.670 --> 05:46:04.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:07.490 --> 05:46:07.500 align:start position:0%
153 give us a couple of minutes to reset
 
05:46:07.500 --> 05:47:52.310 align:start position:0%
153 give us a couple of minutes to reset
please

05:47:52.310 --> 05:47:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:55.430 --> 05:47:55.440 align:start position:0%
okay being 3 15 and I'm going to open up
 
05:47:57.650 --> 05:47:57.660 align:start position:0%
the public hearing on House Bill 153
 
05:47:59.930 --> 05:47:59.940 align:start position:0%
relative to roadway pedestrian control
 
05:48:02.090 --> 05:48:02.100 align:start position:0%

05:48:08.030 --> 05:48:08.040 align:start position:0%
um floor is yours welcome thank you Mr
 
05:48:11.030 --> 05:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
chairman members of the committee uh
 
05:48:13.610 --> 05:48:13.620 align:start position:0%
this is a short and simple Bill to fix
 
05:48:16.548 --> 05:48:16.558 align:start position:0%
what I see as problems with RSA 26511
 
05:48:19.490 --> 05:48:19.500 align:start position:0%
which controls pedestrian signals that
 
05:48:21.590 --> 05:48:21.600 align:start position:0%
signalize intersections
 
05:48:23.030 --> 05:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
first I think it might help to explain
 
05:48:24.830 --> 05:48:24.840 align:start position:0%
my interest in the subject I'm a
 
05:48:27.170 --> 05:48:27.180 align:start position:0%
semi-retired lawyer now but I had a
 
05:48:29.030 --> 05:48:29.040 align:start position:0%

planning
 
05:48:33.650 --> 05:48:33.660 align:start position:0%
projects I worked on involved traffic
 
05:48:35.330 --> 05:48:35.340 align:start position:0%
circulation pedestrian
 
05:48:38.448 --> 05:48:38.458 align:start position:0%
parking and towns from Massachusetts to
 
05:48:39.948 --> 05:48:39.958 align:start position:0%
Hartford San Antonio New Orleans
 
05:48:41.448 --> 05:48:41.458 align:start position:0%
Southern California
 
05:48:42.708 --> 05:48:42.718 align:start position:0%
that was part of the team that
 
05:48:44.868 --> 05:48:44.878 align:start position:0%
documented and provided for the tens of
 
05:48:46.610 --> 05:48:46.620 align:start position:0%
thousands of pedestrian movements that
 
05:48:49.548 --> 05:48:49.558 align:start position:0%
crossed the path of the of Boston's big
 
05:48:52.730 --> 05:48:52.740 align:start position:0%
dig construction project back in the 90s
 
05:48:54.770 --> 05:48:54.780 align:start position:0%
these projects typically involve
 
05:48:56.448 --> 05:48:56.458 align:start position:0%
balancing the needs of buses and other
 
05:48:58.670 --> 05:48:58.680 align:start position:0%
Transit automobile drivers trucks and
 
05:49:01.250 --> 05:49:01.260 align:start position:0%
pedestrians parking and of course the
 
05:49:03.530 --> 05:49:03.540 align:start position:0%
businesses that depend on all this
 
05:49:05.990 --> 05:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
so as I'm used to read recently that
 
05:49:08.030 --> 05:49:08.040 align:start position:0%
California had repealed its anti-j
 
05:49:09.708 --> 05:49:09.718 align:start position:0%
walking laws
 
05:49:12.350 --> 05:49:12.360 align:start position:0%
I was stopped by a police officer in
 
05:49:14.150 --> 05:49:14.160 align:start position:0%
California once for jaywalking so I
 
05:49:16.670 --> 05:49:16.680 align:start position:0%
certainly got to see that firsthand
 
05:49:18.230 --> 05:49:18.240 align:start position:0%
I was let off with a warning when I
 
05:49:19.310 --> 05:49:19.320 align:start position:0%
explained that we're from New England
 
05:49:21.288 --> 05:49:21.298 align:start position:0%
and we can cross the street there
 
05:49:21.298 --> 05:49:22.730 align:start position:0%
and we can cross the street there
legally

05:49:22.730 --> 05:49:22.740 align:start position:0%
legally
 
05:49:24.470 --> 05:49:24.480 align:start position:0%
but in California Jay we're locking laws
 
05:49:27.948 --> 05:49:27.958 align:start position:0%
were once part of a a strong automobile
 
05:49:27.958 --> 05:49:29.330 align:start position:0%
were once part of a a strong automobile
culture

05:49:29.330 --> 05:49:29.340 align:start position:0%
culture
 
05:49:31.730 --> 05:49:31.740 align:start position:0%
uh where streets reserved for cars and
 
05:49:33.230 --> 05:49:33.240 align:start position:0%
not for people
 
05:49:34.610 --> 05:49:34.620 align:start position:0%
but now you can cross the street in
 
05:49:35.750 --> 05:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
California as long as you don't
 
05:49:38.090 --> 05:49:38.100 align:start position:0%
interfere with traffic
 
05:49:39.948 --> 05:49:39.958 align:start position:0%
that prompted me to look at rjwalking
 
05:49:42.048 --> 05:49:42.058 align:start position:0%
and other anti-pedestrian laws and while
 
05:49:43.730 --> 05:49:43.740 align:start position:0%
we're not as Andy pedestrians California
 
05:49:46.368 --> 05:49:46.378 align:start position:0%
once was we do have numerous
 
05:49:48.708 --> 05:49:48.718 align:start position:0%
restrictions on how when and and where
 
05:49:50.628 --> 05:49:50.638 align:start position:0%
people can use the street
 
05:49:52.730 --> 05:49:52.740 align:start position:0%
these restrictions most are punishable
 
05:49:54.830 --> 05:49:54.840 align:start position:0%
less violations are in various places in
 
05:49:58.310 --> 05:49:58.320 align:start position:0%
RSA 265. this bill only addresses one
 
05:50:00.288 --> 05:50:00.298 align:start position:0%
situation Crossing at an intersection
 
05:50:01.850 --> 05:50:01.860 align:start position:0%
where there are pedestrian walk and
 
05:50:03.410 --> 05:50:03.420 align:start position:0%
don't walk signals
 
05:50:07.490 --> 05:50:07.500 align:start position:0%
it's controlled by RSA 260 511.
 
05:50:09.110 --> 05:50:09.120 align:start position:0%
there are two problems with the statute
 
05:50:10.850 --> 05:50:10.860 align:start position:0%
as it's now written
 
05:50:13.310 --> 05:50:13.320 align:start position:0%
first it refers to signals with the
 
05:50:16.128 --> 05:50:16.138 align:start position:0%
words walk and don't walk for
 
05:50:16.138 --> 05:50:17.448 align:start position:0%
words walk and don't walk for
pedestrians

05:50:17.448 --> 05:50:17.458 align:start position:0%
pedestrians
 
05:50:19.368 --> 05:50:19.378 align:start position:0%
these particular signals are Obsolete
 
05:50:21.048 --> 05:50:21.058 align:start position:0%
and have been for 20 years
 
05:50:22.910 --> 05:50:22.920 align:start position:0%
the manual of uniform traffic control
 
05:50:25.128 --> 05:50:25.138 align:start position:0%
devices has required the white
 
05:50:27.530 --> 05:50:27.540 align:start position:0%
walking figure and the orange upraised
 
05:50:27.540 --> 05:50:28.368 align:start position:0%
walking figure and the orange upraised
hand

05:50:28.368 --> 05:50:28.378 align:start position:0%
hand
 
05:50:30.288 --> 05:50:30.298 align:start position:0%
for new installations of pedestrian
 
05:50:34.070 --> 05:50:34.080 align:start position:0%
signals since the 2003 Edition
 
05:50:37.070 --> 05:50:37.080 align:start position:0%
more importantly RSA 26511 has written
 
05:50:39.708 --> 05:50:39.718 align:start position:0%
prohibits certain crossings that are
 
05:50:41.510 --> 05:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
legal at every other intersection in the
 
05:50:43.910 --> 05:50:43.920 align:start position:0%
state that is crossing the street within
 
05:50:45.650 --> 05:50:45.660 align:start position:0%
the crosswalk parallel with the vehicle
 
05:50:49.548 --> 05:50:49.558 align:start position:0%
movements uh that are that are parallel
 
05:50:50.930 --> 05:50:50.940 align:start position:0%
to the direction you're Crossing Street
 
05:50:50.940 --> 05:50:53.448 align:start position:0%
to the direction you're Crossing Street
in

05:50:53.448 --> 05:50:53.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:54.708 --> 05:50:54.718 align:start position:0%
um the rules we learned as kids are
 
05:50:56.628 --> 05:50:56.638 align:start position:0%
pretty simple at crosswalks with no
 
05:50:58.190 --> 05:50:58.200 align:start position:0%
traffic signals pedestrians have the
 
05:50:59.810 --> 05:50:59.820 align:start position:0%
right of way
 
05:51:02.690 --> 05:51:02.700 align:start position:0%
you look listen look both ways
 
05:51:04.070 --> 05:51:04.080 align:start position:0%
and then
 
05:51:07.150 --> 05:51:07.160 align:start position:0%
only then we across
 
05:51:09.470 --> 05:51:09.480 align:start position:0%
in the crosswalk and under those
 
05:51:11.270 --> 05:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
circumstances pedestrians have the right
 
05:51:11.280 --> 05:51:12.830 align:start position:0%
circumstances pedestrians have the right
away

05:51:12.830 --> 05:51:12.840 align:start position:0%
away
 
05:51:14.510 --> 05:51:14.520 align:start position:0%
I'm happy that most drivers in the state
 
05:51:17.628 --> 05:51:17.638 align:start position:0%
and certainly near where I live most
 
05:51:19.548 --> 05:51:19.558 align:start position:0%
drivers honor this rule
 
05:51:21.170 --> 05:51:21.180 align:start position:0%
now it signalized intersections
 
05:51:23.270 --> 05:51:23.280 align:start position:0%
pedestrians crossing the street
 
05:51:25.430 --> 05:51:25.440 align:start position:0%
must yield to through vehicles that have
 
05:51:27.770 --> 05:51:27.780 align:start position:0%
the green signal while turning Vehicles
 
05:51:29.208 --> 05:51:29.218 align:start position:0%
yield to pedestrians that are in the
 
05:51:31.730 --> 05:51:31.740 align:start position:0%
crosswalk this works just fine at
 
05:51:33.530 --> 05:51:33.540 align:start position:0%
hundreds hundreds of intersections
 
05:51:35.270 --> 05:51:35.280 align:start position:0%
across the state
 
05:51:37.490 --> 05:51:37.500 align:start position:0%
however under the current pedestrian
 
05:51:39.048 --> 05:51:39.058 align:start position:0%
signal statute there's another rule one
 
05:51:41.868 --> 05:51:41.878 align:start position:0%
that can contradict the normal rule
 
05:51:44.208 --> 05:51:44.218 align:start position:0%
that his pedestrians must wait for and
 
05:51:46.490 --> 05:51:46.500 align:start position:0%
obey the PED signal even if the cross
 
05:51:48.830 --> 05:51:48.840 align:start position:0%
even if they're crossing the street is
 
05:51:51.830 --> 05:51:51.840 align:start position:0%
otherwise legal and safe
 
05:51:53.750 --> 05:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
it's a particular problem with
 
05:51:56.090 --> 05:51:56.100 align:start position:0%
pedestrian activated signals these are
 
05:51:58.310 --> 05:51:58.320 align:start position:0%
the crossing signals that constantly
 
05:52:00.288 --> 05:52:00.298 align:start position:0%
display don't walk until pedestrian
 
05:52:02.330 --> 05:52:02.340 align:start position:0%
pushes a button they would then activate
 
05:52:05.750 --> 05:52:05.760 align:start position:0%
The Pedestrian signal on the next cycle
 
05:52:08.510 --> 05:52:08.520 align:start position:0%
pedestrian has to wait up to two minutes
 
05:52:10.670 --> 05:52:10.680 align:start position:0%
for the cycle to come around to the to
 
05:52:14.448 --> 05:52:14.458 align:start position:0%
uh The Pedestrian signal and if it's an
 
05:52:16.070 --> 05:52:16.080 align:start position:0%
exclusive pedestrian phase that causes
 
05:52:17.390 --> 05:52:17.400 align:start position:0%
all the other traffic in both directions
 
05:52:18.770 --> 05:52:18.780 align:start position:0%
to have to wait
 
05:52:22.910 --> 05:52:22.920 align:start position:0%
for at least 20 seconds often a lot more
 
05:52:24.590 --> 05:52:24.600 align:start position:0%
the rule that prohibits people from
 
05:52:27.288 --> 05:52:27.298 align:start position:0%
Crossing when they orange hand is raised
 
05:52:30.350 --> 05:52:30.360 align:start position:0%
or right now it just says don't walk
 
05:52:33.410 --> 05:52:33.420 align:start position:0%
it's rarely enforced and frequently
 
05:52:35.690 --> 05:52:35.700 align:start position:0%
ignored and in fact somebody crossing
 
05:52:38.570 --> 05:52:38.580 align:start position:0%
the street in a safe manner legal at all
 
05:52:41.090 --> 05:52:41.100 align:start position:0%
other intersections
 
05:52:43.730 --> 05:52:43.740 align:start position:0%
um isn't doing an unsafe act by crossing
 
05:52:46.128 --> 05:52:46.138 align:start position:0%
the street but you know the unsafe act
 
05:52:48.890 --> 05:52:48.900 align:start position:0%
occurs only if they fail the yield
 
05:52:51.770 --> 05:52:51.780 align:start position:0%
uh do other traffic or traffic fields to
 
05:52:53.330 --> 05:52:53.340 align:start position:0%
yield to The Pedestrian
 
05:52:56.150 --> 05:52:56.160 align:start position:0%
so that the
 
05:52:58.548 --> 05:52:58.558 align:start position:0%
uh the provision that
 
05:53:00.530 --> 05:53:00.540 align:start position:0%
it's still prohibited if if The
 
05:53:03.048 --> 05:53:03.058 align:start position:0%
Pedestrian interferes with traffic uh
 
05:53:05.570 --> 05:53:05.580 align:start position:0%
will still work
 
05:53:05.580 --> 05:53:07.070 align:start position:0%
will still work
uh

05:53:07.070 --> 05:53:07.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:53:09.350 --> 05:53:09.360 align:start position:0%
right now with the obsolete language
 
05:53:11.270 --> 05:53:11.280 align:start position:0%
it's not clear that this
 
05:53:14.890 --> 05:53:14.900 align:start position:0%
current statute applies anywhere because
 
05:53:17.628 --> 05:53:17.638 align:start position:0%
whereas there may be some older signal
 
05:53:19.670 --> 05:53:19.680 align:start position:0%
systems that still use the the don't
 
05:53:22.490 --> 05:53:22.500 align:start position:0%
walk words in most places they don't but
 
05:53:25.190 --> 05:53:25.200 align:start position:0%
rather than trying to repeal the section
 
05:53:28.190 --> 05:53:28.200 align:start position:0%
I've suggested two updates
 
05:53:31.190 --> 05:53:31.200 align:start position:0%
one is to update the uh the first part
 
05:53:33.350 --> 05:53:33.360 align:start position:0%
that says refers to the don't walk and
 
05:53:36.048 --> 05:53:36.058 align:start position:0%
don't and walk signals to include
 
05:53:37.788 --> 05:53:37.798 align:start position:0%
equivalent symbols that are provided for
 
05:53:39.170 --> 05:53:39.180 align:start position:0%
under the manual
 
05:53:41.930 --> 05:53:41.940 align:start position:0%
of uniform traffic control devices
 
05:53:43.970 --> 05:53:43.980 align:start position:0%
right now that's the upraised hand and
 
05:53:46.190 --> 05:53:46.200 align:start position:0%
the walking figure
 
05:53:48.770 --> 05:53:48.780 align:start position:0%
and the second fix is it says the
 
05:53:51.350 --> 05:53:51.360 align:start position:0%
pedestrians are only in violation if
 
05:53:53.208 --> 05:53:53.218 align:start position:0%
they interfere with traffic that has the
 
05:53:54.890 --> 05:53:54.900 align:start position:0%
right of way
 
05:53:56.628 --> 05:53:56.638 align:start position:0%
if this bill does not
 
05:53:58.368 --> 05:53:58.378 align:start position:0%
compromise safety it doesn't change
 
05:53:59.990 --> 05:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
anything that's out there on the street
 
05:54:00.000 --> 05:54:00.948 align:start position:0%
anything that's out there on the street
now

05:54:00.948 --> 05:54:00.958 align:start position:0%
now
 
05:54:02.570 --> 05:54:02.580 align:start position:0%
pedestrian signals will continue to
 
05:54:05.270 --> 05:54:05.280 align:start position:0%
operate the way they they do now anyone
 
05:54:07.850 --> 05:54:07.860 align:start position:0%
who wants to or needs to use the
 
05:54:09.708 --> 05:54:09.718 align:start position:0%
have the Assurance of a walk signal can
 
05:54:11.390 --> 05:54:11.400 align:start position:0%
still push the button or wait until the
 
05:54:13.010 --> 05:54:13.020 align:start position:0%
signal changes
 
05:54:14.930 --> 05:54:14.940 align:start position:0%
now this builds a small change designed
 
05:54:16.670 --> 05:54:16.680 align:start position:0%
to chip away at the notion that cars are
 
05:54:16.680 --> 05:54:17.628 align:start position:0%
to chip away at the notion that cars are
King

05:54:17.628 --> 05:54:17.638 align:start position:0%
King
 
05:54:19.310 --> 05:54:19.320 align:start position:0%
and pedestrians don't belong in our
 
05:54:21.410 --> 05:54:21.420 align:start position:0%
cities and towns
 
05:54:22.788 --> 05:54:22.798 align:start position:0%
that's all I have to say and I'd be glad
 
05:54:24.770 --> 05:54:24.780 align:start position:0%
to take questions
 
05:54:26.030 --> 05:54:26.040 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for any
 
05:54:27.830 --> 05:54:27.840 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
05:54:29.510 --> 05:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
representative Hill thank you Mr
 
05:54:31.190 --> 05:54:31.200 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
05:54:33.770 --> 05:54:33.780 align:start position:0%
question I read this three times and I
 
05:54:35.810 --> 05:54:35.820 align:start position:0%
really aside from the fact that maybe
 
05:54:38.810 --> 05:54:38.820 align:start position:0%
this is a bookkeeping thing is there any
 
05:54:40.610 --> 05:54:40.620 align:start position:0%
other purpose to this besides just
 
05:54:42.230 --> 05:54:42.240 align:start position:0%
changing the language so that it
 
05:54:44.510 --> 05:54:44.520 align:start position:0%
reflects current right technology
 
05:54:47.810 --> 05:54:47.820 align:start position:0%
they're two parts the first part just
 
05:54:51.170 --> 05:54:51.180 align:start position:0%
includes the new signals as as provided
 
05:54:53.270 --> 05:54:53.280 align:start position:0%
in the mutcd
 
05:54:55.310 --> 05:54:55.320 align:start position:0%
the second part
 
05:54:58.310 --> 05:54:58.320 align:start position:0%
changes right now it says that if you
 
05:55:02.448 --> 05:55:02.458 align:start position:0%
step off the curb when the you know when
 
05:55:03.948 --> 05:55:03.958 align:start position:0%
the don't walk signal is displayed
 
05:55:06.288 --> 05:55:06.298 align:start position:0%
you're in violation and subject to a
 
05:55:06.298 --> 05:55:07.610 align:start position:0%
you're in violation and subject to a
ticket

05:55:07.610 --> 05:55:07.620 align:start position:0%
ticket
 
05:55:10.610 --> 05:55:10.620 align:start position:0%
the change is that you can cross
 
05:55:12.708 --> 05:55:12.718 align:start position:0%
if it's safe to do so if you can do so
 
05:55:15.170 --> 05:55:15.180 align:start position:0%
without interfering with traffic
 
05:55:17.270 --> 05:55:17.280 align:start position:0%
and you don't get a ticket unless you in
 
05:55:18.708 --> 05:55:18.718 align:start position:0%
fact walk in front of
 
05:55:21.590 --> 05:55:21.600 align:start position:0%
uh cars that have the green signal
 
05:55:25.190 --> 05:55:25.200 align:start position:0%
so it it doesn't it doesn't penalize the
 
05:55:26.690 --> 05:55:26.700 align:start position:0%
crossing of the street which is not
 
05:55:28.970 --> 05:55:28.980 align:start position:0%
necessarily an unsafe to act it only
 
05:55:28.980 --> 05:55:30.350 align:start position:0%
necessarily an unsafe to act it only
penalizes

05:55:30.350 --> 05:55:30.360 align:start position:0%
penalizes
 
05:55:32.990 --> 05:55:33.000 align:start position:0%
The Pedestrian if they if they do
 
05:55:35.810 --> 05:55:35.820 align:start position:0%
something that in fact is unsafe
 
05:55:39.470 --> 05:55:39.480 align:start position:0%
quick follow-up yeah follow-up thank you
 
05:55:42.470 --> 05:55:42.480 align:start position:0%
are these not uh where these occur are
 
05:55:45.708 --> 05:55:45.718 align:start position:0%
these not uh mostly covered by city
 
05:55:45.718 --> 05:55:47.150 align:start position:0%
these not uh mostly covered by city
ordinance

05:55:47.150 --> 05:55:47.160 align:start position:0%
ordinance
 
05:55:51.410 --> 05:55:51.420 align:start position:0%
well right now well it like the cities
 
05:55:53.750 --> 05:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
can certainly have an ordinance but if
 
05:55:57.048 --> 05:55:57.058 align:start position:0%
it doesn't conform to the statute it has
 
05:55:58.970 --> 05:55:58.980 align:start position:0%
to be it has to be a clear signage to
 
05:55:58.980 --> 05:55:59.930 align:start position:0%
to be it has to be a clear signage to
indicate

05:55:59.930 --> 05:55:59.940 align:start position:0%
indicate
 
05:55:59.940 --> 05:56:01.610 align:start position:0%
indicate
that

05:56:01.610 --> 05:56:01.620 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:56:04.250 --> 05:56:04.260 align:start position:0%
a different set of rules applies
 
05:56:06.530 --> 05:56:06.540 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
05:56:08.510 --> 05:56:08.520 align:start position:0%
you know if if somebody wants to
 
05:56:10.128 --> 05:56:10.138 align:start position:0%
absolutely prohibit any pedestrian
 
05:56:10.138 --> 05:56:11.590 align:start position:0%
absolutely prohibit any pedestrian
movements

05:56:11.590 --> 05:56:11.600 align:start position:0%
movements
 
05:56:14.510 --> 05:56:14.520 align:start position:0%
an example on the
 
05:56:16.070 --> 05:56:16.080 align:start position:0%
right now you can turn right on red
 
05:56:20.270 --> 05:56:20.280 align:start position:0%
after coming to a stop in your vehicle
 
05:56:22.250 --> 05:56:22.260 align:start position:0%
the city can decide that that's not a
 
05:56:23.330 --> 05:56:23.340 align:start position:0%
safe movement in this particular
 
05:56:25.010 --> 05:56:25.020 align:start position:0%
location but if they want to prohibit
 
05:56:28.610 --> 05:56:28.620 align:start position:0%
right turns on red they have to make the
 
05:56:30.288 --> 05:56:30.298 align:start position:0%
sign is particularly clear that that
 
05:56:31.788 --> 05:56:31.798 align:start position:0%
different set of rules applies at that
 
05:56:31.798 --> 05:56:32.868 align:start position:0%
different set of rules applies at that
intersection

05:56:32.868 --> 05:56:32.878 align:start position:0%
intersection
 
05:56:35.390 --> 05:56:35.400 align:start position:0%
so the same would apply here if they
 
05:56:37.730 --> 05:56:37.740 align:start position:0%
they really want to keep people from
 
05:56:37.740 --> 05:56:39.170 align:start position:0%
they really want to keep people from
Crossing

05:56:39.170 --> 05:56:39.180 align:start position:0%
Crossing
 
05:56:41.090 --> 05:56:41.100 align:start position:0%
according to the
 
05:56:43.190 --> 05:56:43.200 align:start position:0%
the other rules the rules that apply
 
05:56:44.750 --> 05:56:44.760 align:start position:0%
other than that
 
05:56:48.230 --> 05:56:48.240 align:start position:0%
these pet signal intersections they may
 
05:56:50.570 --> 05:56:50.580 align:start position:0%
have to make that clear to the you know
 
05:56:52.610 --> 05:56:52.620 align:start position:0%
the people walking on the street
 
05:56:53.990 --> 05:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:56:56.150 --> 05:56:56.160 align:start position:0%
representative O'Hara thank you Mr
 
05:56:56.990 --> 05:56:57.000 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
05:56:59.330 --> 05:56:59.340 align:start position:0%
question um do you
 
05:57:02.390 --> 05:57:02.400 align:start position:0%
I could just see this going as could in
 
05:57:04.250 --> 05:57:04.260 align:start position:0%
Laconia we have six Lane intersections
 
05:57:06.170 --> 05:57:06.180 align:start position:0%
it could you could not be interfering
 
05:57:07.430 --> 05:57:07.440 align:start position:0%
for the first three lanes and then
 
05:57:09.170 --> 05:57:09.180 align:start position:0%
you're stuck on an island and then what
 
05:57:10.850 --> 05:57:10.860 align:start position:0%
happens to The Pedestrian do they stand
 
05:57:12.650 --> 05:57:12.660 align:start position:0%
there in the island do they have a clear
 
05:57:15.350 --> 05:57:15.360 align:start position:0%
way to go the next three lanes or I just
 
05:57:16.910 --> 05:57:16.920 align:start position:0%
I I know it'll work well in Concord for
 
05:57:18.230 --> 05:57:18.240 align:start position:0%
like these small back roads but in
 
05:57:21.890 --> 05:57:21.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:24.288 --> 05:57:24.298 align:start position:0%
was there a question
 
05:57:24.298 --> 05:57:27.350 align:start position:0%
was there a question
um

05:57:27.350 --> 05:57:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:29.510 --> 05:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
so what it you know depends on how this
 
05:57:31.368 --> 05:57:31.378 align:start position:0%
intersection is designed
 
05:57:34.788 --> 05:57:34.798 align:start position:0%
so the signal timing
 
05:57:37.730 --> 05:57:37.740 align:start position:0%
is supposed to be such that a pedestrian
 
05:57:39.708 --> 05:57:39.718 align:start position:0%
can cross the street
 
05:57:43.610 --> 05:57:43.620 align:start position:0%
on the phase where that is a safe move
 
05:57:47.448 --> 05:57:47.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:49.910 --> 05:57:49.920 align:start position:0%
the general rule is you take the the
 
05:57:52.010 --> 05:57:52.020 align:start position:0%
width that they have to cross divided by
 
05:57:54.048 --> 05:57:54.058 align:start position:0%
three and a half feet per second and
 
05:57:56.868 --> 05:57:56.878 align:start position:0%
seven seconds per at open time and then
 
05:57:59.810 --> 05:57:59.820 align:start position:0%
you know so a 50-foot Street you know
 
05:58:01.910 --> 05:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
you want to have a 30 second
 
05:58:01.920 --> 05:58:04.270 align:start position:0%
you want to have a 30 second
uh

05:58:04.270 --> 05:58:04.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:58:06.830 --> 05:58:06.840 align:start position:0%
well less than 30 seconds of time for
 
05:58:08.570 --> 05:58:08.580 align:start position:0%
pedestrians to cross so
 
05:58:10.190 --> 05:58:10.200 align:start position:0%
if there's not enough time for them to
 
05:58:12.470 --> 05:58:12.480 align:start position:0%
cross then the intersections in the
 
05:58:16.970 --> 05:58:16.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:16.980 --> 05:58:18.410 align:start position:0%
 
a follow-up

05:58:18.410 --> 05:58:18.420 align:start position:0%
a follow-up
 
05:58:21.470 --> 05:58:21.480 align:start position:0%
question yeah so where I was trying to
 
05:58:23.570 --> 05:58:23.580 align:start position:0%
get with it is we're trying to say that
 
05:58:24.770 --> 05:58:24.780 align:start position:0%
as long as they're not interfering with
 
05:58:26.390 --> 05:58:26.400 align:start position:0%
traffic they can walk on the do not walk
 
05:58:29.208 --> 05:58:29.218 align:start position:0%
correct that's correct okay and then if
 
05:58:31.368 --> 05:58:31.378 align:start position:0%
in Laconia there's a six-lane
 
05:58:33.350 --> 05:58:33.360 align:start position:0%
intersection they may not be interfere
 
05:58:34.730 --> 05:58:34.740 align:start position:0%
they may think they'd not be going to be
 
05:58:36.170 --> 05:58:36.180 align:start position:0%
interfere because they can't see you
 
05:58:38.690 --> 05:58:38.700 align:start position:0%
know 35 seconds out but car comes down
 
05:58:39.650 --> 05:58:39.660 align:start position:0%
the corner then they're doing pretty
 
05:58:42.430 --> 05:58:42.440 align:start position:0%
much traffic who are we gonna like
 
05:58:44.690 --> 05:58:44.700 align:start position:0%
the car comes around the corner they
 
05:58:46.910 --> 05:58:46.920 align:start position:0%
have to yield to The Pedestrian so
 
05:58:48.410 --> 05:58:48.420 align:start position:0%
turning traffic always has to yield to
 
05:58:48.420 --> 05:58:50.570 align:start position:0%
turning traffic always has to yield to
pedestrians

05:58:50.570 --> 05:58:50.580 align:start position:0%
pedestrians
 
05:58:50.580 --> 05:58:55.090 align:start position:0%
pedestrians
foreign

05:58:55.090 --> 05:58:55.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:58.070 --> 05:58:58.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I'm looking in
 
05:59:00.530 --> 05:59:00.540 align:start position:0%
here and I don't see uh
 
05:59:03.590 --> 05:59:03.600 align:start position:0%
clearly saying that you can go ahead and
 
05:59:07.310 --> 05:59:07.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:09.948 --> 05:59:09.958 align:start position:0%
assuming that the traffic it doesn't say
 
05:59:14.150 --> 05:59:14.160 align:start position:0%
that that well it talks about where
 
05:59:21.470 --> 05:59:21.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:23.510 --> 05:59:23.520 align:start position:0%
but this changes that no pedestrians
 
05:59:25.070 --> 05:59:25.080 align:start position:0%
shall cross the road away in the
 
05:59:26.570 --> 05:59:26.580 align:start position:0%
direction of such signals when a don't
 
05:59:28.368 --> 05:59:28.378 align:start position:0%
walk or equivalent signal is displayed
 
05:59:30.650 --> 05:59:30.660 align:start position:0%
if such Crossing interferes with
 
05:59:32.810 --> 05:59:32.820 align:start position:0%
vehicular traffic
 
05:59:36.590 --> 05:59:36.600 align:start position:0%
so it says not to cross when the note
 
05:59:40.070 --> 05:59:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:40.080 --> 05:59:43.190 align:start position:0%
 
uh

05:59:43.190 --> 05:59:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:45.890 --> 05:59:45.900 align:start position:0%
if if in you know under the conditions
 
05:59:47.690 --> 05:59:47.700 align:start position:0%
that that interferes so if there's no
 
05:59:47.700 --> 05:59:49.730 align:start position:0%
that that interferes so if there's no
traffic

05:59:49.730 --> 05:59:49.740 align:start position:0%
traffic
 
05:59:52.610 --> 05:59:52.620 align:start position:0%
and you cross when this says don't walk
 
05:59:54.230 --> 05:59:54.240 align:start position:0%
there's no traffic in either direction
 
05:59:56.150 --> 05:59:56.160 align:start position:0%
there's no violation
 
05:59:58.310 --> 05:59:58.320 align:start position:0%
under the proposed
 
05:59:58.320 --> 06:00:01.610 align:start position:0%
under the proposed
rule

06:00:01.610 --> 06:00:01.620 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:04.150 --> 06:00:04.160 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
06:00:06.288 --> 06:00:06.298 align:start position:0%
representative Sinclair
 
06:00:08.448 --> 06:00:08.458 align:start position:0%
would you consider a friendly amendment
 
06:00:11.510 --> 06:00:11.520 align:start position:0%
to this that if somebody
 
06:00:14.570 --> 06:00:14.580 align:start position:0%
pushes the walk thing and then walks
 
06:00:16.128 --> 06:00:16.138 align:start position:0%
across doesn't wait for it to come on
 
06:00:18.890 --> 06:00:18.900 align:start position:0%
and holds up traffic that that would be
 
06:00:21.110 --> 06:00:21.120 align:start position:0%
a violation of some sort right well you
 
06:00:23.448 --> 06:00:23.458 align:start position:0%
know that happens all the time now and
 
06:00:26.090 --> 06:00:26.100 align:start position:0%
it creates a lot of resentment
 
06:00:28.788 --> 06:00:28.798 align:start position:0%
and this hopefully would reduce that if
 
06:00:30.590 --> 06:00:30.600 align:start position:0%
you feel confident that you can you know
 
06:00:33.230 --> 06:00:33.240 align:start position:0%
when to cross the street safely
 
06:00:35.448 --> 06:00:35.458 align:start position:0%
then you don't push the button and right
 
06:00:37.010 --> 06:00:37.020 align:start position:0%
now you go out and look at any other in
 
06:00:39.048 --> 06:00:39.058 align:start position:0%
sections in the area here and you'll see
 
06:00:41.030 --> 06:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
people doing that right now this this
 
06:00:45.590 --> 06:00:45.600 align:start position:0%
law has violated dozens of times a day
 
06:00:47.930 --> 06:00:47.940 align:start position:0%
um because exactly that no nobody wants
 
06:00:50.030 --> 06:00:50.040 align:start position:0%
to be the bad guy that you know stops
 
06:00:51.708 --> 06:00:51.718 align:start position:0%
traffic when you when it's not necessary
 
06:00:54.410 --> 06:00:54.420 align:start position:0%
but you know if you're
 
06:00:56.510 --> 06:00:56.520 align:start position:0%
unsure about walking or unsure about
 
06:00:58.788 --> 06:00:58.798 align:start position:0%
your eyesight or whatever and you need
 
06:01:00.410 --> 06:01:00.420 align:start position:0%
that then you need to have those buttons
 
06:01:03.350 --> 06:01:03.360 align:start position:0%
uh for that circumstance but you know
 
06:01:06.590 --> 06:01:06.600 align:start position:0%
the extent that this helps reduce the
 
06:01:09.470 --> 06:01:09.480 align:start position:0%
conflict between cars and
 
06:01:11.628 --> 06:01:11.638 align:start position:0%
not just the physical conflict but also
 
06:01:12.948 --> 06:01:12.958 align:start position:0%
this exactly what you're talking about
 
06:01:15.288 --> 06:01:15.298 align:start position:0%
the resentment that builds up when
 
06:01:15.298 --> 06:01:18.350 align:start position:0%
the resentment that builds up when
pedestrians

06:01:18.350 --> 06:01:18.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:20.570 --> 06:01:20.580 align:start position:0%
hold up traffic
 
06:01:22.730 --> 06:01:22.740 align:start position:0%
you know if there's less resentment then
 
06:01:25.490 --> 06:01:25.500 align:start position:0%
there's less aggressive driving and
 
06:01:27.470 --> 06:01:27.480 align:start position:0%
it may end up being a safer situation
 
06:01:27.480 --> 06:01:31.330 align:start position:0%
it may end up being a safer situation
overall

06:01:31.330 --> 06:01:31.340 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:35.090 --> 06:01:35.100 align:start position:0%
and yet representative Style
 
06:01:36.470 --> 06:01:36.480 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman
 
06:01:39.350 --> 06:01:39.360 align:start position:0%
um as I look at Roman numeral two you
 
06:01:41.390 --> 06:01:41.400 align:start position:0%
read the first part that says that a
 
06:01:42.948 --> 06:01:42.958 align:start position:0%
pedestrian even though it says don't
 
06:01:45.830 --> 06:01:45.840 align:start position:0%
walk if there is no traffic they can go
 
06:01:48.048 --> 06:01:48.058 align:start position:0%
forward and move across the street but
 
06:01:49.788 --> 06:01:49.798 align:start position:0%
the second part says however any
 
06:01:51.830 --> 06:01:51.840 align:start position:0%
pedestrian who has partially completed
 
06:01:54.830 --> 06:01:54.840 align:start position:0%
her or his Crossing on the walk signal
 
06:01:57.190 --> 06:01:57.200 align:start position:0%
shall proceed to a sidewalk or safety
 
06:01:59.868 --> 06:01:59.878 align:start position:0%
island is that contradictory or
 
06:02:03.650 --> 06:02:03.660 align:start position:0%
redundant or unnecessary no that that
 
06:02:06.548 --> 06:02:06.558 align:start position:0%
basically says that if you are
 
06:02:10.368 --> 06:02:10.378 align:start position:0%
in the in the crossing and the light
 
06:02:12.890 --> 06:02:12.900 align:start position:0%
turns you know hand comes up
 
06:02:15.110 --> 06:02:15.120 align:start position:0%
right then you were instructed to
 
06:02:15.120 --> 06:02:16.970 align:start position:0%
right then you were instructed to
continue

06:02:16.970 --> 06:02:16.980 align:start position:0%
continue
 
06:02:18.708 --> 06:02:18.718 align:start position:0%
that's the current that's the current
 
06:02:20.750 --> 06:02:20.760 align:start position:0%
law so that you
 
06:02:22.670 --> 06:02:22.680 align:start position:0%
you continue to the nearest point of
 
06:02:24.708 --> 06:02:24.718 align:start position:0%
safety and then you know you still have
 
06:02:27.830 --> 06:02:27.840 align:start position:0%
the right of way yeah follow-up
 
06:02:29.628 --> 06:02:29.638 align:start position:0%
yeah I'll give you follow up but yeah so
 
06:02:32.770 --> 06:02:32.780 align:start position:0%
my question is is that still necessary
 
06:02:36.350 --> 06:02:36.360 align:start position:0%
if I mean because you know certainly I
 
06:02:38.448 --> 06:02:38.458 align:start position:0%
have entered into a crossrock and then
 
06:02:39.948 --> 06:02:39.958 align:start position:0%
the thing starts blinking when I'm in
 
06:02:41.330 --> 06:02:41.340 align:start position:0%
I'm in the middle of the street and then
 
06:02:45.170 --> 06:02:45.180 align:start position:0%
I I go but if we get rid of the idea
 
06:02:48.110 --> 06:02:48.120 align:start position:0%
that if there's no traffic coming that
 
06:02:50.448 --> 06:02:50.458 align:start position:0%
you have to wait for the the little man
 
06:02:52.070 --> 06:02:52.080 align:start position:0%
to come on
 
06:02:55.430 --> 06:02:55.440 align:start position:0%
um then it's unlikely that you'll be in
 
06:02:58.730 --> 06:02:58.740 align:start position:0%
the middle some people will still use
 
06:03:01.490 --> 06:03:01.500 align:start position:0%
The Pedestrian signals and there's some
 
06:03:03.470 --> 06:03:03.480 align:start position:0%
places where the pedestrian signal comes
 
06:03:05.810 --> 06:03:05.820 align:start position:0%
on that in every cycle
 
06:03:07.548 --> 06:03:07.558 align:start position:0%
you know parallels with the movement of
 
06:03:09.770 --> 06:03:09.780 align:start position:0%
traffic so there are situations where
 
06:03:12.590 --> 06:03:12.600 align:start position:0%
somebody has started out
 
06:03:12.600 --> 06:03:14.030 align:start position:0%
somebody has started out
and

06:03:14.030 --> 06:03:14.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:03:14.040 --> 06:03:16.010 align:start position:0%
and
uh

06:03:16.010 --> 06:03:16.020 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:03:17.510 --> 06:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
you know they're still in the middle of
 
06:03:19.250 --> 06:03:19.260 align:start position:0%
the crosswalk
 
06:03:20.628 --> 06:03:20.638 align:start position:0%
you know somebody walks slowly for
 
06:03:23.030 --> 06:03:23.040 align:start position:0%
example I mean a 3.5 feet per second is
 
06:03:25.010 --> 06:03:25.020 align:start position:0%
pretty pretty brisk
 
06:03:26.868 --> 06:03:26.878 align:start position:0%
If somebody walks slowly maybe halfway
 
06:03:29.208 --> 06:03:29.218 align:start position:0%
across the in the intersection when the
 
06:03:31.548 --> 06:03:31.558 align:start position:0%
green light comes on for the for the
 
06:03:33.890 --> 06:03:33.900 align:start position:0%
traffic now they have to continue to
 
06:03:37.970 --> 06:03:37.980 align:start position:0%
they they get to continue to the curb
 
06:03:39.890 --> 06:03:39.900 align:start position:0%
thank you continue to have the right of
 
06:03:42.470 --> 06:03:42.480 align:start position:0%
way that's all that that phrase means
 
06:03:43.850 --> 06:03:43.860 align:start position:0%
and that's in the current statute as
 
06:03:47.208 --> 06:03:47.218 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:48.948 --> 06:03:48.958 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
06:03:50.750 --> 06:03:50.760 align:start position:0%
okay seeing none thank you very much
 
06:03:52.910 --> 06:03:52.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:03:56.090 --> 06:03:56.100 align:start position:0%
uh next she recognizes representative
 
06:03:58.368 --> 06:03:58.378 align:start position:0%
Rhodes uh in support of the bill looking
 
06:04:01.548 --> 06:04:01.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:04.490 --> 06:04:04.500 align:start position:0%
oh this is 260. sorry it's in the wrong
 
06:04:06.708 --> 06:04:06.718 align:start position:0%
pile I apologize
 
06:04:10.670 --> 06:04:10.680 align:start position:0%
uh so chair recognizes William Lambert
 
06:04:11.628 --> 06:04:11.638 align:start position:0%
from New Hampshire Department of
 
06:04:11.638 --> 06:04:14.330 align:start position:0%
from New Hampshire Department of
Transportation

06:04:14.330 --> 06:04:14.340 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:14.340 --> 06:04:18.788 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

06:04:18.788 --> 06:04:18.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:21.048 --> 06:04:21.058 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
06:04:23.448 --> 06:04:23.458 align:start position:0%
committee uh welcome back
 
06:04:25.310 --> 06:04:25.320 align:start position:0%
um for those that don't know me there's
 
06:04:26.930 --> 06:04:26.940 align:start position:0%
a lot of new faces here my name is Bill
 
06:04:28.610 --> 06:04:28.620 align:start position:0%
Lambert I'm the state traffic engineer
 
06:04:30.410 --> 06:04:30.420 align:start position:0%
for the New Hampshire D.O.T and before I
 
06:04:32.270 --> 06:04:32.280 align:start position:0%
forget the answer to representative
 
06:04:34.670 --> 06:04:34.680 align:start position:0%
staub's question is that that the
 
06:04:36.650 --> 06:04:36.660 align:start position:0%
sentence that you're referring to is in
 
06:04:38.750 --> 06:04:38.760 align:start position:0%
the paragraph for a don't walk display
 
06:04:41.570 --> 06:04:41.580 align:start position:0%
so it essentially says if you are in the
 
06:04:43.850 --> 06:04:43.860 align:start position:0%
crosswalk during walk display and then
 
06:04:45.170 --> 06:04:45.180 align:start position:0%
it turns to don't walk they don't want
 
06:04:46.850 --> 06:04:46.860 align:start position:0%
you to turn around and go backwards they
 
06:04:49.070 --> 06:04:49.080 align:start position:0%
keep going to where you your destination
 
06:04:51.410 --> 06:04:51.420 align:start position:0%
was because the signal is a time so that
 
06:04:53.570 --> 06:04:53.580 align:start position:0%
you can get to The Far Side pedestrian
 
06:04:55.610 --> 06:04:55.620 align:start position:0%
signals are very complicated
 
06:04:56.868 --> 06:04:56.878 align:start position:0%
um there's probably a lot of job
 
06:04:58.430 --> 06:04:58.440 align:start position:0%
security for me because people don't
 
06:04:59.930 --> 06:04:59.940 align:start position:0%
understand how they're supposed to work
 
06:05:02.570 --> 06:05:02.580 align:start position:0%
and they tend to be modified for the
 
06:05:03.890 --> 06:05:03.900 align:start position:0%
record I just returned from Washington
 
06:05:06.410 --> 06:05:06.420 align:start position:0%
DC I spent three days there last week
 
06:05:09.830 --> 06:05:09.840 align:start position:0%
with 353 like-minded folks talking about
 
06:05:12.110 --> 06:05:12.120 align:start position:0%
exactly what's in the mutcd so if you
 
06:05:13.610 --> 06:05:13.620 align:start position:0%
can imagine what kind of experience that
 
06:05:16.850 --> 06:05:16.860 align:start position:0%
is that's what I'm coming from today so
 
06:05:21.110 --> 06:05:21.120 align:start position:0%
welcome home thank you very much so the
 
06:05:23.570 --> 06:05:23.580 align:start position:0%
dot is not opposed to this bill I think
 
06:05:26.810 --> 06:05:26.820 align:start position:0%
the language is somewhat clunky and I
 
06:05:28.010 --> 06:05:28.020 align:start position:0%
think some of the questions that I heard
 
06:05:31.610 --> 06:05:31.620 align:start position:0%
earlier kind of indicate that and and I
 
06:05:33.530 --> 06:05:33.540 align:start position:0%
also wanted to talk about and attach it
 
06:05:35.628 --> 06:05:35.638 align:start position:0%
to the handout or the written comments
 
06:05:36.910 --> 06:05:36.920 align:start position:0%
that I have is
 
06:05:39.410 --> 06:05:39.420 align:start position:0%
discuss the uniform vehicle code so the
 
06:05:41.270 --> 06:05:41.280 align:start position:0%
uniform vehicle code
 
06:05:45.110 --> 06:05:45.120 align:start position:0%
is a um is a document that's created by
 
06:05:47.030 --> 06:05:47.040 align:start position:0%
a collective of 50 states it hasn't been
 
06:05:50.208 --> 06:05:50.218 align:start position:0%
updated since the year 2000 but within
 
06:05:51.890 --> 06:05:51.900 align:start position:0%
the uniform vehicle code in the uniform
 
06:05:53.868 --> 06:05:53.878 align:start position:0%
vehicle code includes model laws and
 
06:05:55.490 --> 06:05:55.500 align:start position:0%
ordinances for all things vehicles and
 
06:05:57.350 --> 06:05:57.360 align:start position:0%
going to representative Sinclair's
 
06:05:59.030 --> 06:05:59.040 align:start position:0%
question about the federal issue with
 
06:06:01.430 --> 06:06:01.440 align:start position:0%
tires those types of things are in the
 
06:06:03.110 --> 06:06:03.120 align:start position:0%
uniform vehicle code so that when States
 
06:06:05.868 --> 06:06:05.878 align:start position:0%
adopt rules of the road that they're
 
06:06:07.430 --> 06:06:07.440 align:start position:0%
consistent that people know what they're
 
06:06:09.708 --> 06:06:09.718 align:start position:0%
gonna what they are from state to state
 
06:06:11.930 --> 06:06:11.940 align:start position:0%
but the uniform vehicle code has
 
06:06:14.208 --> 06:06:14.218 align:start position:0%
language that if you look on the page
 
06:06:17.510 --> 06:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
129 of the attachment under their
 
06:06:20.270 --> 06:06:20.280 align:start position:0%
chapter 11-203 pedestrian control
 
06:06:23.208 --> 06:06:23.218 align:start position:0%
signals is almost verbatim so it's in
 
06:06:25.128 --> 06:06:25.138 align:start position:0%
our in our statutes and there's a reason
 
06:06:27.230 --> 06:06:27.240 align:start position:0%
for that because the uniform vehicle
 
06:06:29.150 --> 06:06:29.160 align:start position:0%
code is created so that states can adopt
 
06:06:31.970 --> 06:06:31.980 align:start position:0%
consistent language so if I look at the
 
06:06:33.530 --> 06:06:33.540 align:start position:0%
language that's in that 11 203
 
06:06:35.570 --> 06:06:35.580 align:start position:0%
pedestrian control signals
 
06:06:38.090 --> 06:06:38.100 align:start position:0%
just to clear up within our current uh
 
06:06:38.100 --> 06:06:39.610 align:start position:0%
just to clear up within our current uh
statute

06:06:39.610 --> 06:06:39.620 align:start position:0%
statute
 
06:06:42.590 --> 06:06:42.600 align:start position:0%
rather than or the equivalent visual or
 
06:06:44.208 --> 06:06:44.218 align:start position:0%
audible signals in reference to the
 
06:06:46.430 --> 06:06:46.440 align:start position:0%
mutcd it simply says
 
06:06:49.128 --> 06:06:49.138 align:start position:0%
The Walker don't walk or symbols of a
 
06:06:51.170 --> 06:06:51.180 align:start position:0%
walking person or up raised Palm are in
 
06:06:53.628 --> 06:06:53.638 align:start position:0%
place so that that would be consistent
 
06:06:55.070 --> 06:06:55.080 align:start position:0%
with the uniform vehicle code and I
 
06:06:56.990 --> 06:06:57.000 align:start position:0%
think it's cleaner language
 
06:06:59.270 --> 06:06:59.280 align:start position:0%
I look at paragraph two when it's it's
 
06:07:01.430 --> 06:07:01.440 align:start position:0%
proposed in the cross out steadier or
 
06:07:05.270 --> 06:07:05.280 align:start position:0%
flashing in one of the things that I
 
06:07:07.310 --> 06:07:07.320 align:start position:0%
look at on this and again pedestrian
 
06:07:08.990 --> 06:07:09.000 align:start position:0%
signals are kind of evolving over time
 
06:07:12.110 --> 06:07:12.120 align:start position:0%
right now we don't flash the walk symbol
 
06:07:14.750 --> 06:07:14.760 align:start position:0%
but the mutcd in the current
 
06:07:16.490 --> 06:07:16.500 align:start position:0%
infrastructure bill that just passed
 
06:07:18.470 --> 06:07:18.480 align:start position:0%
last year
 
06:07:20.208 --> 06:07:20.218 align:start position:0%
um includes a requirement that Federal
 
06:07:22.310 --> 06:07:22.320 align:start position:0%
Highway will adopt in the next edition
 
06:07:25.850 --> 06:07:25.860 align:start position:0%
of the mutcd by May of this year so
 
06:07:27.230 --> 06:07:27.240 align:start position:0%
there may be changes to what's in the
 
06:07:28.310 --> 06:07:28.320 align:start position:0%
current bill and one of the changes
 
06:07:31.368 --> 06:07:31.378 align:start position:0%
they've talked about is having instead
 
06:07:33.890 --> 06:07:33.900 align:start position:0%
of the Walk The don't walk with the
 
06:07:36.048 --> 06:07:36.058 align:start position:0%
countdown symbol if you've seen that on
 
06:07:38.090 --> 06:07:38.100 align:start position:0%
any of the newer signals you would have
 
06:07:39.530 --> 06:07:39.540 align:start position:0%
the walk
 
06:07:41.690 --> 06:07:41.700 align:start position:0%
um flashing so it would come up at the
 
06:07:43.128 --> 06:07:43.138 align:start position:0%
beginning of the Walk face pedestrian
 
06:07:45.708 --> 06:07:45.718 align:start position:0%
phase would walk steady and then when it
 
06:07:48.170 --> 06:07:48.180 align:start position:0%
got to a point where there was only
 
06:07:49.788 --> 06:07:49.798 align:start position:0%
enough time to cross the length of the
 
06:07:52.368 --> 06:07:52.378 align:start position:0%
road it would start flashing don't it
 
06:07:53.868 --> 06:07:53.878 align:start position:0%
would stop flashing walk with the
 
06:07:55.730 --> 06:07:55.740 align:start position:0%
countdown number to let people know how
 
06:07:57.288 --> 06:07:57.298 align:start position:0%
much time there was
 
06:07:59.750 --> 06:07:59.760 align:start position:0%
um so I I would I would tend to leave
 
06:08:02.150 --> 06:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
this the flashing or steady or flashing
 
06:08:03.948 --> 06:08:03.958 align:start position:0%
in the lane in the build just because I
 
06:08:05.990 --> 06:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
think it it may change in the near
 
06:08:07.628 --> 06:08:07.638 align:start position:0%
future and it doesn't hurt the way it is
 
06:08:10.548 --> 06:08:10.558 align:start position:0%
and then in the last paragraph the don't
 
06:08:13.910 --> 06:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
walk paragraph uh the when they don't
 
06:08:16.250 --> 06:08:16.260 align:start position:0%
walk or equivalent signal is displayed I
 
06:08:18.170 --> 06:08:18.180 align:start position:0%
think is redundant to the clarification
 
06:08:20.628 --> 06:08:20.638 align:start position:0%
that was in the first paragraph it
 
06:08:23.150 --> 06:08:23.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily add and may even add
 
06:08:25.850 --> 06:08:25.860 align:start position:0%
some confusion and then leave it just as
 
06:08:28.610 --> 06:08:28.620 align:start position:0%
it it's shown in my writ uh written
 
06:08:31.190 --> 06:08:31.200 align:start position:0%
comments on the second page I had what
 
06:08:34.128 --> 06:08:34.138 align:start position:0%
it would be in a clean clean document
 
06:08:36.650 --> 06:08:36.660 align:start position:0%
in the last paragraph
 
06:08:40.970 --> 06:08:40.980 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:43.490 --> 06:08:43.500 align:start position:0%
again we're not going to comment on on
 
06:08:44.990 --> 06:08:45.000 align:start position:0%
the merits of the bill I'd be happy to
 
06:08:46.730 --> 06:08:46.740 align:start position:0%
answer any questions on it
 
06:08:48.650 --> 06:08:48.660 align:start position:0%
um but I'm just looking at cleaning it
 
06:08:49.970 --> 06:08:49.980 align:start position:0%
up to be more consistent with the
 
06:08:52.310 --> 06:08:52.320 align:start position:0%
uniform vehicle code
 
06:08:53.990 --> 06:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
and with that I'd be happy to take any
 
06:08:55.850 --> 06:08:55.860 align:start position:0%
questions thank you sir any questions
 
06:08:58.430 --> 06:08:58.440 align:start position:0%
from the committee
 
06:09:00.650 --> 06:09:00.660 align:start position:0%
representative Hill thank you and thank
 
06:09:02.628 --> 06:09:02.638 align:start position:0%
you Mr Lambert for coming in and
 
06:09:03.948 --> 06:09:03.958 align:start position:0%
speaking with us
 
06:09:05.930 --> 06:09:05.940 align:start position:0%
um would you be willing to help with a
 
06:09:07.670 --> 06:09:07.680 align:start position:0%
an amendment to clean up the language
 
06:09:09.048 --> 06:09:09.058 align:start position:0%
that we
 
06:09:11.208 --> 06:09:11.218 align:start position:0%
that you just discussed
 
06:09:12.708 --> 06:09:12.718 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you for the question
 
06:09:16.128 --> 06:09:16.138 align:start position:0%
I'd be I'd be happy to thank you
 
06:09:17.868 --> 06:09:17.878 align:start position:0%
you beat me to it representative Hill
 
06:09:19.390 --> 06:09:19.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:09:21.770 --> 06:09:21.780 align:start position:0%
representative C
 
06:09:23.930 --> 06:09:23.940 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
06:09:26.090 --> 06:09:26.100 align:start position:0%
um just trying to figure this out and
 
06:09:28.070 --> 06:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering uh on the bill itself
 
06:09:32.270 --> 06:09:32.280 align:start position:0%
on line 11. it looks to me like uh we
 
06:09:34.250 --> 06:09:34.260 align:start position:0%
should strike out where it says on the
 
06:09:37.490 --> 06:09:37.500 align:start position:0%
walk signal so it just says if any
 
06:09:39.470 --> 06:09:39.480 align:start position:0%
pedestrian has partially completed his
 
06:09:42.048 --> 06:09:42.058 align:start position:0%
or her Crossing shall proceed to the
 
06:09:46.150 --> 06:09:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:49.610 --> 06:09:49.620 align:start position:0%
because we're talking about the
 
06:09:52.910 --> 06:09:52.920 align:start position:0%
possibility of people uh starting
 
06:09:55.208 --> 06:09:55.218 align:start position:0%
without waiting for the walk
 
06:09:58.190 --> 06:09:58.200 align:start position:0%
indication correct and thank you for the
 
06:09:59.270 --> 06:09:59.280 align:start position:0%
question so again this is another
 
06:10:01.548 --> 06:10:01.558 align:start position:0%
paragraph that's titled don't walk so it
 
06:10:03.830 --> 06:10:03.840 align:start position:0%
has to do with the the uh the ref the
 
06:10:06.048 --> 06:10:06.058 align:start position:0%
references that it's what to do on the
 
06:10:08.390 --> 06:10:08.400 align:start position:0%
don't walk symbol so that last sentence
 
06:10:10.430 --> 06:10:10.440 align:start position:0%
indicates that if you have partially
 
06:10:13.368 --> 06:10:13.378 align:start position:0%
completed the Crossing
 
06:10:15.350 --> 06:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
um you shall proceed to to a sidewalk a
 
06:10:16.910 --> 06:10:16.920 align:start position:0%
safety Island on the walk I think is
 
06:10:18.170 --> 06:10:18.180 align:start position:0%
something that was clarified in this
 
06:10:19.670 --> 06:10:19.680 align:start position:0%
state maybe different than the uniform
 
06:10:22.128 --> 06:10:22.138 align:start position:0%
vehicle code I don't know if it adds or
 
06:10:23.628 --> 06:10:23.638 align:start position:0%
detracts from it I think it's just a
 
06:10:25.250 --> 06:10:25.260 align:start position:0%
clarifying statement but it's
 
06:10:27.230 --> 06:10:27.240 align:start position:0%
essentially if you're if you're in a
 
06:10:29.628 --> 06:10:29.638 align:start position:0%
crosswalk when it starts to flash don't
 
06:10:29.638 --> 06:10:30.530 align:start position:0%
crosswalk when it starts to flash don't
walk

06:10:30.530 --> 06:10:30.540 align:start position:0%
walk
 
06:10:32.330 --> 06:10:32.340 align:start position:0%
um you're supposed to keep walking and
 
06:10:33.948 --> 06:10:33.958 align:start position:0%
to get to the either the other side or
 
06:10:36.590 --> 06:10:36.600 align:start position:0%
to a safety Island and like um
 
06:10:38.990 --> 06:10:39.000 align:start position:0%
representative the sponsor said
 
06:10:41.208 --> 06:10:41.218 align:start position:0%
um traffic signals a time so that the uh
 
06:10:42.410 --> 06:10:42.420 align:start position:0%
it's I think it's three feet per second
 
06:10:45.470 --> 06:10:45.480 align:start position:0%
because of the Aging population but uh
 
06:10:47.330 --> 06:10:47.340 align:start position:0%
their their time to allow a pedestrian
 
06:10:49.670 --> 06:10:49.680 align:start position:0%
to go from one side to the far side it
 
06:10:51.830 --> 06:10:51.840 align:start position:0%
used to be to the middle of the lane on
 
06:10:54.110 --> 06:10:54.120 align:start position:0%
the farthest Lane but now it's curb to
 
06:10:56.330 --> 06:10:56.340 align:start position:0%
curb so that we make sure that somebody
 
06:10:57.530 --> 06:10:57.540 align:start position:0%
has enough time to get all the way
 
06:10:57.540 --> 06:11:00.230 align:start position:0%
has enough time to get all the way
across

06:11:00.230 --> 06:11:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:02.990 --> 06:11:03.000 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
06:11:06.650 --> 06:11:06.660 align:start position:0%
um I agree well with uh representative
 
06:11:07.910 --> 06:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
Hill I was going to ask the same
 
06:11:09.948 --> 06:11:09.958 align:start position:0%
question I think the original language
 
06:11:11.990 --> 06:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
and the current law which is what's in
 
06:11:13.730 --> 06:11:13.740 align:start position:0%
regular type is confusing to begin with
 
06:11:16.070 --> 06:11:16.080 align:start position:0%
uh the extra language doesn't help so
 
06:11:18.350 --> 06:11:18.360 align:start position:0%
I'm anxious myself to see if you can
 
06:11:20.930 --> 06:11:20.940 align:start position:0%
work on something that helps it just a
 
06:11:22.788 --> 06:11:22.798 align:start position:0%
little easier for everybody to read I
 
06:11:24.170 --> 06:11:24.180 align:start position:0%
think we'll have a better look at it
 
06:11:25.730 --> 06:11:25.740 align:start position:0%
then because I don't see anybody with
 
06:11:28.730 --> 06:11:28.740 align:start position:0%
any opposition per se to what's being
 
06:11:31.610 --> 06:11:31.620 align:start position:0%
attempted uh I have nobody else signed
 
06:11:33.590 --> 06:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
up to speak so thank you very much I'm
 
06:11:34.910 --> 06:11:34.920 align:start position:0%
going to close the public hearing on
 
06:11:38.570 --> 06:11:38.580 align:start position:0%

06:13:23.048 --> 06:13:23.058 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:26.030 --> 06:13:26.040 align:start position:0%
okay being 341 I'm going to open up the
 
06:13:29.048 --> 06:13:29.058 align:start position:0%
public hearing on House Bill 260 FN

I'm here this afternoon to introduce you
 
06:14:04.910 --> 06:14:04.920 align:start position:0%
to House Bill 260 FN
 
06:14:08.810 --> 06:14:08.820 align:start position:0%
which as you just heard is prohibiting
 
06:14:11.750 --> 06:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
pets from or animals being on a driver's
 
06:14:13.910 --> 06:14:13.920 align:start position:0%
lap while they're operating a vehicle
 
06:14:16.190 --> 06:14:16.200 align:start position:0%
uh the reason this bill came about was
 
06:14:18.770 --> 06:14:18.780 align:start position:0%
over the summer uh the little girl that
 
06:14:20.810 --> 06:14:20.820 align:start position:0%
lives across the street for me or used
 
06:14:21.890 --> 06:14:21.900 align:start position:0%
to she was there visiting her
 
06:14:21.900 --> 06:14:22.788 align:start position:0%
to she was there visiting her
grandmother

06:14:22.788 --> 06:14:22.798 align:start position:0%
grandmother
 
06:14:24.410 --> 06:14:24.420 align:start position:0%
little girl wasn't doing anything wrong
 
06:14:25.970 --> 06:14:25.980 align:start position:0%
she was actually on the sidewalk where
 
06:14:28.910 --> 06:14:28.920 align:start position:0%
she was supposed to be and before she
 
06:14:30.170 --> 06:14:30.180 align:start position:0%
crossed the street there was a car
 
06:14:33.048 --> 06:14:33.058 align:start position:0%
coming so she was actually going up the
 
06:14:33.058 --> 06:14:34.190 align:start position:0%
coming so she was actually going up the
sidewalk

06:14:34.190 --> 06:14:34.200 align:start position:0%
sidewalk
 
06:14:35.750 --> 06:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
you know
 
06:14:37.850 --> 06:14:37.860 align:start position:0%
she was going up the sidewalk instead of
 
06:14:39.470 --> 06:14:39.480 align:start position:0%
just crossing I guess give herself
 
06:14:40.548 --> 06:14:40.558 align:start position:0%
something to do for those couple seconds
 
06:14:42.350 --> 06:14:42.360 align:start position:0%
till the car passed
 
06:14:45.350 --> 06:14:45.360 align:start position:0%
and the car that was driving down the
 
06:14:45.360 --> 06:14:46.190 align:start position:0%
and the car that was driving down the
street

06:14:46.190 --> 06:14:46.200 align:start position:0%
street
 
06:14:48.650 --> 06:14:48.660 align:start position:0%
had two dogs
 
06:14:53.030 --> 06:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
on his arm and he was steering with the
 
06:14:55.128 --> 06:14:55.138 align:start position:0%
left arm with the two dogs that were
 
06:14:57.048 --> 06:14:57.058 align:start position:0%
resting on this arm and at the same time
 
06:14:59.810 --> 06:14:59.820 align:start position:0%
he was petting these dogs unfortunately
 
06:15:02.390 --> 06:15:02.400 align:start position:0%
the little girl was on a little one of
 
06:15:05.690 --> 06:15:05.700 align:start position:0%
those little Razor scooters and she hit
 
06:15:07.910 --> 06:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
a bump and she fell off of her scooter
 
06:15:09.470 --> 06:15:09.480 align:start position:0%
onto the street
 
06:15:13.010 --> 06:15:13.020 align:start position:0%
and the car being more distracted with
 
06:15:14.570 --> 06:15:14.580 align:start position:0%
petting his dogs instead of actually
 
06:15:18.530 --> 06:15:18.540 align:start position:0%
able to steer to avoid this almost hit
 
06:15:20.090 --> 06:15:20.100 align:start position:0%
the little girl the only reason he
 
06:15:22.190 --> 06:15:22.200 align:start position:0%
didn't was because the grandmother
 
06:15:24.048 --> 06:15:24.058 align:start position:0%
happened to be there and she was able to
 
06:15:26.628 --> 06:15:26.638 align:start position:0%
grab her and pull her off the street
 
06:15:29.330 --> 06:15:29.340 align:start position:0%
so I remember thinking back when I was
 
06:15:32.150 --> 06:15:32.160 align:start position:0%
you know a teenager and I would see
 
06:15:33.830 --> 06:15:33.840 align:start position:0%
embarrassingly enough my grandfather
 
06:15:35.270 --> 06:15:35.280 align:start position:0%
driving down the road with his dog on
 
06:15:36.470 --> 06:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
his arm and I used to say are you crazy
 
06:15:37.788 --> 06:15:37.798 align:start position:0%
that's like the stupidest thing I've
 
06:15:39.048 --> 06:15:39.058 align:start position:0%
ever seen
 
06:15:40.548 --> 06:15:40.558 align:start position:0%
and then I kind of forgot about it and
 
06:15:41.750 --> 06:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
then when this happened I was like
 
06:15:43.850 --> 06:15:43.860 align:start position:0%
that's it this is absolutely ridiculous
 
06:15:46.010 --> 06:15:46.020 align:start position:0%
and then I started looking into it
 
06:15:48.230 --> 06:15:48.240 align:start position:0%
and there was nothing that said that you
 
06:15:50.150 --> 06:15:50.160 align:start position:0%
weren't allowed to do this and I took it
 
06:15:51.590 --> 06:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
upon myself to call a couple
 
06:15:52.970 --> 06:15:52.980 align:start position:0%
representatives to see if they'd be
 
06:15:55.490 --> 06:15:55.500 align:start position:0%
interested in co-sponsoring a bill or
 
06:15:59.090 --> 06:15:59.100 align:start position:0%
what they thought and surprisingly a lot
 
06:16:00.590 --> 06:16:00.600 align:start position:0%
of people said you don't need to write
 
06:16:02.750 --> 06:16:02.760 align:start position:0%
that bill it's already illegal
 
06:16:06.590 --> 06:16:06.600 align:start position:0%
and it is not already illegal
 
06:16:08.810 --> 06:16:08.820 align:start position:0%
when I wrote this piece of legislation I
 
06:16:11.510 --> 06:16:11.520 align:start position:0%
never in my wildest dreams thought that
 
06:16:12.830 --> 06:16:12.840 align:start position:0%
this would become one of the more
 
06:16:15.948 --> 06:16:15.958 align:start position:0%
controversial controversial bills of the
 
06:16:19.010 --> 06:16:19.020 align:start position:0%
session but by God here we are
 
06:16:19.020 --> 06:16:20.390 align:start position:0%
session but by God here we are
so

06:16:20.390 --> 06:16:20.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:16:20.400 --> 06:16:21.770 align:start position:0%
so
um

06:16:21.770 --> 06:16:21.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:16:25.310 --> 06:16:25.320 align:start position:0%
the newspaper did an article and I
 
06:16:27.470 --> 06:16:27.480 align:start position:0%
received my fair share of hate grams
 
06:16:30.048 --> 06:16:30.058 align:start position:0%
that came after the article was written
 
06:16:32.868 --> 06:16:32.878 align:start position:0%
and I also received my share of thank
 
06:16:34.490 --> 06:16:34.500 align:start position:0%
God it's about time
 
06:16:36.948 --> 06:16:36.958 align:start position:0%
one of the emails I received was from a
 
06:16:40.670 --> 06:16:40.680 align:start position:0%
lady that had her brother-in-law that
 
06:16:41.810 --> 06:16:41.820 align:start position:0%
was killed
 
06:16:45.110 --> 06:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
by a driver that had his pet on his lap
 
06:16:47.090 --> 06:16:47.100 align:start position:0%
and came around the bends kind of a
 
06:16:49.730 --> 06:16:49.740 align:start position:0%
similar situation and and hit him and
 
06:16:51.230 --> 06:16:51.240 align:start position:0%
you know he and his wife were taking a
 
06:16:52.910 --> 06:16:52.920 align:start position:0%
walk and he was struck by him and he
 
06:16:52.920 --> 06:16:54.470 align:start position:0%
walk and he was struck by him and he
died

06:16:54.470 --> 06:16:54.480 align:start position:0%
died
 
06:16:57.650 --> 06:16:57.660 align:start position:0%
another lady wrote me a not so kind
 
06:17:00.890 --> 06:17:00.900 align:start position:0%
email telling me how horribly rude I was
 
06:17:04.128 --> 06:17:04.138 align:start position:0%
because she loves her dogs and how dare
 
06:17:05.750 --> 06:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
I say that she can't drive around the
 
06:17:07.910 --> 06:17:07.920 align:start position:0%
road with him on her lap
 
06:17:11.030 --> 06:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
well she went on to say how that if she
 
06:17:13.490 --> 06:17:13.500 align:start position:0%
was taking her dog unfortunately to be
 
06:17:16.750 --> 06:17:16.760 align:start position:0%
put down and that I had better believe
 
06:17:19.910 --> 06:17:19.920 align:start position:0%
that she would be holding her dog for
 
06:17:22.970 --> 06:17:22.980 align:start position:0%
his last breaths on the way to the vet
 
06:17:25.250 --> 06:17:25.260 align:start position:0%
I've owned three Saint Bernards in my
 
06:17:25.260 --> 06:17:26.448 align:start position:0%
I've owned three Saint Bernards in my
lifetime

06:17:26.448 --> 06:17:26.458 align:start position:0%
lifetime
 
06:17:28.850 --> 06:17:28.860 align:start position:0%
sadly all three of my dogs have had to
 
06:17:31.430 --> 06:17:31.440 align:start position:0%
been put down
 
06:17:34.250 --> 06:17:34.260 align:start position:0%
the one was one year old he was 168
 
06:17:36.048 --> 06:17:36.058 align:start position:0%
pounds so according to her logic there
 
06:17:37.250 --> 06:17:37.260 align:start position:0%
was absolutely no reason that I couldn't
 
06:17:39.708 --> 06:17:39.718 align:start position:0%
drive down the road consoling my dog
 
06:17:41.990 --> 06:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
because I loved him just as much as she
 
06:17:43.970 --> 06:17:43.980 align:start position:0%
loves her dog
 
06:17:46.670 --> 06:17:46.680 align:start position:0%
but apparently the only reason anybody
 
06:17:49.910 --> 06:17:49.920 align:start position:0%
has is because they love their dog
 
06:17:52.070 --> 06:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
I remember once upon a time when people
 
06:17:53.570 --> 06:17:53.580 align:start position:0%
would drive down the road with their
 
06:17:55.610 --> 06:17:55.620 align:start position:0%
children on their laps I was one of
 
06:17:56.990 --> 06:17:57.000 align:start position:0%
those people my mother used to hold me
 
06:17:58.970 --> 06:17:58.980 align:start position:0%
on her lap
 
06:18:01.730 --> 06:18:01.740 align:start position:0%
we don't do that anymore that is illegal
 
06:18:04.128 --> 06:18:04.138 align:start position:0%
it took something right a lot of bad
 
06:18:05.510 --> 06:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
things happen
 
06:18:07.490 --> 06:18:07.500 align:start position:0%
so while I was doing the research on
 
06:18:08.990 --> 06:18:09.000 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
06:18:10.730 --> 06:18:10.740 align:start position:0%
I know this is going to be a question so
 
06:18:12.890 --> 06:18:12.900 align:start position:0%
I would like to answer it currently
 
06:18:16.730 --> 06:18:16.740 align:start position:0%
Hawaii is the one and only state that
 
06:18:19.250 --> 06:18:19.260 align:start position:0%
has a law that specifically prohibits
 
06:18:21.230 --> 06:18:21.240 align:start position:0%
animals from being on a person's lap
 
06:18:23.990 --> 06:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
only Hawaii however
 
06:18:27.170 --> 06:18:27.180 align:start position:0%
many many states are far more
 
06:18:31.190 --> 06:18:31.200 align:start position:0%
restrictive Massachusetts says that
 
06:18:33.650 --> 06:18:33.660 align:start position:0%
a dog has to be
 
06:18:36.770 --> 06:18:36.780 align:start position:0%
restrained some way so if the person you
 
06:18:38.868 --> 06:18:38.878 align:start position:0%
know if the if the passenger is driving
 
06:18:40.250 --> 06:18:40.260 align:start position:0%
down the road it's okay for the
 
06:18:42.470 --> 06:18:42.480 align:start position:0%
passenger to be holding the dog but that
 
06:18:46.128 --> 06:18:46.138 align:start position:0%
dog or cat lizard whatever it may be is
 
06:18:47.690 --> 06:18:47.700 align:start position:0%
not allowed to basically cross that line
 
06:18:51.410 --> 06:18:51.420 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:51.420 --> 06:18:52.070 align:start position:0%
 
um

06:18:52.070 --> 06:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:18:59.048 --> 06:18:59.058 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:02.868 --> 06:19:02.878 align:start position:0%
so New Jersey
 
06:19:05.628 --> 06:19:05.638 align:start position:0%
Rhode Island Arizona Connecticut Hawaii
 
06:19:07.490 --> 06:19:07.500 align:start position:0%
as I mentioned Iowa Maine Massachusetts
 
06:19:10.670 --> 06:19:10.680 align:start position:0%
South Carolina Washington DC all have
 
06:19:12.350 --> 06:19:12.360 align:start position:0%
some kind of destructive driver's laws
 
06:19:15.470 --> 06:19:15.480 align:start position:0%
that say most of them say that the dog
 
06:19:17.510 --> 06:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
has to actually be
 
06:19:20.690 --> 06:19:20.700 align:start position:0%
or cat says that the animal has to be
 
06:19:23.270 --> 06:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
restrained a lot of the laws say that
 
06:19:25.730 --> 06:19:25.740 align:start position:0%
they actually have to be in a carrier or
 
06:19:27.650 --> 06:19:27.660 align:start position:0%
some kind of a seat belt
 
06:19:31.430 --> 06:19:31.440 align:start position:0%
so I was not trying to be you know that
 
06:19:32.750 --> 06:19:32.760 align:start position:0%
prohibitive and say that you actually
 
06:19:36.230 --> 06:19:36.240 align:start position:0%
have to restrain your dog or your cat
 
06:19:37.610 --> 06:19:37.620 align:start position:0%
um but I thought this was at least
 
06:19:37.620 --> 06:19:38.990 align:start position:0%
um but I thought this was at least
something

06:19:38.990 --> 06:19:39.000 align:start position:0%
something
 
06:19:42.350 --> 06:19:42.360 align:start position:0%
so the the statistics
 
06:19:46.490 --> 06:19:46.500 align:start position:0%
show that a dog that weighs 30 pounds if
 
06:19:48.830 --> 06:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
they were to be in a car crash would be
 
06:19:52.190 --> 06:19:52.200 align:start position:0%
exert roughly 300 pounds of pressure
 
06:19:55.070 --> 06:19:55.080 align:start position:0%
a dog that weighs 80 pounds
 
06:19:58.490 --> 06:19:58.500 align:start position:0%
says that it would be a dog that weighs
 
06:20:02.570 --> 06:20:02.580 align:start position:0%
80 pounds would exert approximately 2400
 
06:20:04.310 --> 06:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
pounds of force
 
06:20:06.470 --> 06:20:06.480 align:start position:0%
so needless to say if you're actually
 
06:20:08.270 --> 06:20:08.280 align:start position:0%
driving with this pet on your lap and
 
06:20:09.948 --> 06:20:09.958 align:start position:0%
the airbag deploys
 
06:20:13.490 --> 06:20:13.500 align:start position:0%
the dog the cat is going to get killed
 
06:20:14.810 --> 06:20:14.820 align:start position:0%
it's that simple it's going to get
 
06:20:14.820 --> 06:20:15.708 align:start position:0%
it's that simple it's going to get
killed

06:20:15.708 --> 06:20:15.718 align:start position:0%
killed
 
06:20:17.930 --> 06:20:17.940 align:start position:0%
however just because they're on the
 
06:20:19.970 --> 06:20:19.980 align:start position:0%
passenger seat there even if the airbag
 
06:20:21.530 --> 06:20:21.540 align:start position:0%
deploys which it may not because it
 
06:20:22.788 --> 06:20:22.798 align:start position:0%
might not weigh enough to make it if
 
06:20:24.170 --> 06:20:24.180 align:start position:0%
it's on your lap as you're the driver
 
06:20:26.990 --> 06:20:27.000 align:start position:0%
that is absolutely going to happen
 
06:20:28.788 --> 06:20:28.798 align:start position:0%
the problem that we have is there aren't
 
06:20:31.670 --> 06:20:31.680 align:start position:0%
any real statistics that show how many
 
06:20:34.310 --> 06:20:34.320 align:start position:0%
people or what the danger is
 
06:20:36.470 --> 06:20:36.480 align:start position:0%
and the other states that have been
 
06:20:38.090 --> 06:20:38.100 align:start position:0%
trying to pass laws where I actually
 
06:20:40.430 --> 06:20:40.440 align:start position:0%
found either the representatives or the
 
06:20:42.170 --> 06:20:42.180 align:start position:0%
senators all said the same thing that I
 
06:20:43.850 --> 06:20:43.860 align:start position:0%
have said that the pushback that they've
 
06:20:45.288 --> 06:20:45.298 align:start position:0%
got was that there aren't any real
 
06:20:47.030 --> 06:20:47.040 align:start position:0%
statistics that show that
 
06:20:49.430 --> 06:20:49.440 align:start position:0%
so according to AAA
 
06:20:49.440 --> 06:20:50.810 align:start position:0%
so according to AAA
um

06:20:50.810 --> 06:20:50.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:20:54.230 --> 06:20:54.240 align:start position:0%
they are saying that the the potential
 
06:20:56.810 --> 06:20:56.820 align:start position:0%
dangers are enough that legislators
 
06:20:58.670 --> 06:20:58.680 align:start position:0%
should be making some kind of decision
 
06:21:00.110 --> 06:21:00.120 align:start position:0%
on whether or not they're going to do
 
06:21:02.628 --> 06:21:02.638 align:start position:0%
this it goes on to talk about
 
06:21:02.638 --> 06:21:03.948 align:start position:0%
this it goes on to talk about
um

06:21:03.948 --> 06:21:03.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:21:06.048 --> 06:21:06.058 align:start position:0%
different studies that have been done
 
06:21:09.770 --> 06:21:09.780 align:start position:0%
over the years and it says
 
06:21:09.780 --> 06:21:10.970 align:start position:0%
over the years and it says
um

06:21:10.970 --> 06:21:10.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:21:14.868 --> 06:21:14.878 align:start position:0%
hold on a second here oh it talks about
 
06:21:17.330 --> 06:21:17.340 align:start position:0%
the fact that an animal is not allowed
 
06:21:18.890 --> 06:21:18.900 align:start position:0%
or doesn't have the ability to actually
 
06:21:20.750 --> 06:21:20.760 align:start position:0%
brace themselves if and when there was
 
06:21:23.208 --> 06:21:23.218 align:start position:0%
going to be any kind of an accident
 
06:21:26.510 --> 06:21:26.520 align:start position:0%
so with all that you know kind of to the
 
06:21:27.830 --> 06:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
to the point
 
06:21:29.510 --> 06:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
um being on
 
06:21:32.090 --> 06:21:32.100 align:start position:0%
criminal justice I know how
 
06:21:33.948 --> 06:21:33.958 align:start position:0%
some of the people in our committee can
 
06:21:36.470 --> 06:21:36.480 align:start position:0%
just take a bill right down to the bone
 
06:21:36.480 --> 06:21:38.090 align:start position:0%
just take a bill right down to the bone
and

06:21:38.090 --> 06:21:38.100 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:21:40.250 --> 06:21:40.260 align:start position:0%
you know find anything so the reason
 
06:21:42.230 --> 06:21:42.240 align:start position:0%
that I had to put you know anywhere in a
 
06:21:45.288 --> 06:21:45.298 align:start position:0%
person is because I could think of a
 
06:21:46.610 --> 06:21:46.620 align:start position:0%
couple Representatives that would say
 
06:21:48.170 --> 06:21:48.180 align:start position:0%
well it's not on my lap he's on my arm
 
06:21:50.270 --> 06:21:50.280 align:start position:0%
okay well that's okay
 
06:21:51.708 --> 06:21:51.718 align:start position:0%
um or they would say well it's not on my
 
06:21:54.288 --> 06:21:54.298 align:start position:0%
lap who's up on the dashboard so that is
 
06:21:56.090 --> 06:21:56.100 align:start position:0%
the reason that I you know kind of had
 
06:21:57.170 --> 06:21:57.180 align:start position:0%
to be
 
06:21:58.788 --> 06:21:58.798 align:start position:0%
you know a little bit more aggressive
 
06:22:01.070 --> 06:22:01.080 align:start position:0%
was because I was trying to think of
 
06:22:02.990 --> 06:22:03.000 align:start position:0%
some of the pushback that we've had from
 
06:22:04.190 --> 06:22:04.200 align:start position:0%
some of the other bills that I've heard
 
06:22:05.330 --> 06:22:05.340 align:start position:0%
over the time
 
06:22:07.010 --> 06:22:07.020 align:start position:0%
so that is
 
06:22:09.048 --> 06:22:09.058 align:start position:0%
my legislation thank you
 
06:22:10.730 --> 06:22:10.740 align:start position:0%
thank you representative any questions
 
06:22:13.490 --> 06:22:13.500 align:start position:0%
from the committee
 
06:22:16.368 --> 06:22:16.378 align:start position:0%
you do okay representative Gorski thank
 
06:22:17.690 --> 06:22:17.700 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you for taking
 
06:22:19.850 --> 06:22:19.860 align:start position:0%
my question you have here the violation
 
06:22:22.610 --> 06:22:22.620 align:start position:0%
for this is a hundred dollars yes
 
06:22:25.250 --> 06:22:25.260 align:start position:0%
what happens after the second time is it
 
06:22:26.750 --> 06:22:26.760 align:start position:0%
still a hundred dollars is it a hundred
 
06:22:28.250 --> 06:22:28.260 align:start position:0%
dollars every time
 
06:22:30.230 --> 06:22:30.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
06:22:33.410 --> 06:22:33.420 align:start position:0%
I did not come up with the penalty in
 
06:22:36.048 --> 06:22:36.058 align:start position:0%
what it should be I sent the the
 
06:22:38.150 --> 06:22:38.160 align:start position:0%
potential legislation over with a list
 
06:22:39.770 --> 06:22:39.780 align:start position:0%
of with a list of questions that I had
 
06:22:42.948 --> 06:22:42.958 align:start position:0%
and whether or not you know how the
 
06:22:45.350 --> 06:22:45.360 align:start position:0%
fines should be and this is what that
 
06:22:47.930 --> 06:22:47.940 align:start position:0%
this is what they had sent me back
 
06:22:50.690 --> 06:22:50.700 align:start position:0%
so on unfortunately I don't really have
 
06:22:52.610 --> 06:22:52.620 align:start position:0%
you know an answer that if it would be
 
06:22:54.170 --> 06:22:54.180 align:start position:0%
you know a stricter penalty the second
 
06:23:01.610 --> 06:23:01.620 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:03.110 --> 06:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
06:23:05.570 --> 06:23:05.580 align:start position:0%
representative sellers thank you Mr
 
06:23:08.270 --> 06:23:08.280 align:start position:0%
chair representative um
 
06:23:10.788 --> 06:23:10.798 align:start position:0%
what age group demographics does this
 
06:23:11.750 --> 06:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
really hit
 
06:23:14.208 --> 06:23:14.218 align:start position:0%
I mean has it been any study to say that
 
06:23:17.090 --> 06:23:17.100 align:start position:0%
people over 50 have dogs on their laps
 
06:23:20.208 --> 06:23:20.218 align:start position:0%
or people under 50.
 
06:23:22.910 --> 06:23:22.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
06:23:25.070 --> 06:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
it has been found that since the
 
06:23:27.830 --> 06:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
pandemic that pet ownership has reached
 
06:23:29.810 --> 06:23:29.820 align:start position:0%
an all-time high of over 70 percent of
 
06:23:32.390 --> 06:23:32.400 align:start position:0%
outs of households actually owning
 
06:23:35.090 --> 06:23:35.100 align:start position:0%
some form of a pet I think that you
 
06:23:37.128 --> 06:23:37.138 align:start position:0%
probably or everybody in this room has
 
06:23:40.128 --> 06:23:40.138 align:start position:0%
probably seen that going simply to the
 
06:23:41.990 --> 06:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
grocery store you're going to see a
 
06:23:44.030 --> 06:23:44.040 align:start position:0%
handful of people that now walk around
 
06:23:46.010 --> 06:23:46.020 align:start position:0%
with some kind of a pet
 
06:23:48.350 --> 06:23:48.360 align:start position:0%
so unfortunately I don't have an answer
 
06:23:51.770 --> 06:23:51.780 align:start position:0%
of the age group of people that actually
 
06:23:55.190 --> 06:23:55.200 align:start position:0%
drive with a pet on their lap but I
 
06:23:57.890 --> 06:23:57.900 align:start position:0%
assure you ever since I actually had the
 
06:23:59.990 --> 06:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
courage to put this in writing
 
06:24:02.750 --> 06:24:02.760 align:start position:0%
I've lost count at how many people drive
 
06:24:04.850 --> 06:24:04.860 align:start position:0%
down the road sadly not with just one
 
06:24:08.150 --> 06:24:08.160 align:start position:0%
but multiple pets on their arm and it's
 
06:24:11.628 --> 06:24:11.638 align:start position:0%
all ranges
 
06:24:14.330 --> 06:24:14.340 align:start position:0%
first drivers up until
 
06:24:19.190 --> 06:24:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:22.430 --> 06:24:22.440 align:start position:0%
any further questions representative
 
06:24:23.810 --> 06:24:23.820 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
06:24:25.190 --> 06:24:25.200 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
06:24:27.110 --> 06:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
um did you mention what the danger is to
 
06:24:29.750 --> 06:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
the driver in an accident with a that's
 
06:24:31.970 --> 06:24:31.980 align:start position:0%
that has a pet on their lap what the
 
06:24:33.650 --> 06:24:33.660 align:start position:0%
force would be
 
06:24:36.590 --> 06:24:36.600 align:start position:0%
you know driving the the pet into their
 
06:24:40.250 --> 06:24:40.260 align:start position:0%
body or you know the impact Force
 
06:24:42.288 --> 06:24:42.298 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
06:24:44.350 --> 06:24:44.360 align:start position:0%
I was not
 
06:24:47.390 --> 06:24:47.400 align:start position:0%
to answer your specific question none of
 
06:24:49.490 --> 06:24:49.500 align:start position:0%
that came up in any of the research that
 
06:24:52.190 --> 06:24:52.200 align:start position:0%
I did the only thing that came up was
 
06:24:56.208 --> 06:24:56.218 align:start position:0%
the danger to the pet itself which is
 
06:24:57.948 --> 06:24:57.958 align:start position:0%
um basically a lot most of the
 
06:25:00.230 --> 06:25:00.240 align:start position:0%
information I found was basically with
 
06:25:03.230 --> 06:25:03.240 align:start position:0%
AAA and the statistics that I read you
 
06:25:05.390 --> 06:25:05.400 align:start position:0%
are all from trip away and it just gives
 
06:25:07.250 --> 06:25:07.260 align:start position:0%
different examples of pets in their
 
06:25:09.288 --> 06:25:09.298 align:start position:0%
different size and continues to talk
 
06:25:10.850 --> 06:25:10.860 align:start position:0%
about the fact that you know if they go
 
06:25:13.910 --> 06:25:13.920 align:start position:0%
they go through the windshield and the
 
06:25:15.830 --> 06:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
other dangers that happen is if there is
 
06:25:19.070 --> 06:25:19.080 align:start position:0%
a collision when I spoke with some EMT
 
06:25:21.650 --> 06:25:21.660 align:start position:0%
First Responders that a lot of times
 
06:25:23.930 --> 06:25:23.940 align:start position:0%
whenever they get to the scene
 
06:25:26.030 --> 06:25:26.040 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the dog is running down
 
06:25:28.070 --> 06:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
the road because whenever they get hurt
 
06:25:31.368 --> 06:25:31.378 align:start position:0%
they run and or if the dog is hurt or
 
06:25:33.830 --> 06:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
the or their owner is hurt they won't
 
06:25:36.470 --> 06:25:36.480 align:start position:0%
allow the First Responders to actually
 
06:25:38.930 --> 06:25:38.940 align:start position:0%
get to the person to do whatever may be
 
06:25:41.208 --> 06:25:41.218 align:start position:0%
done because they're protecting them so
 
06:25:42.890 --> 06:25:42.900 align:start position:0%
I don't know what actually happens to
 
06:25:45.288 --> 06:25:45.298 align:start position:0%
the driver other than you know the real
 
06:25:46.490 --> 06:25:46.500 align:start position:0%
dangers of any other wreck that they
 
06:25:49.250 --> 06:25:49.260 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:53.030 --> 06:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:53.930 --> 06:25:53.940 align:start position:0%
um I heard you already had one
 
06:25:56.750 --> 06:25:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:59.990 --> 06:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:02.330 --> 06:26:02.340 align:start position:0%
microphone thank you representative for
 
06:26:04.070 --> 06:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
bringing this forward in uh I I just
 
06:26:07.128 --> 06:26:07.138 align:start position:0%
want to ask uh section 265 that you're
 
06:26:09.590 --> 06:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
amending is that a distracted driving
 
06:26:11.448 --> 06:26:11.458 align:start position:0%
section and I should have looked that up
 
06:26:14.930 --> 06:26:14.940 align:start position:0%
myself I didn't so I'm asking you so
 
06:26:17.090 --> 06:26:17.100 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question when I
 
06:26:19.070 --> 06:26:19.080 align:start position:0%
submitted this legislation I did say
 
06:26:20.990 --> 06:26:21.000 align:start position:0%
that I was you know basically looking to
 
06:26:22.850 --> 06:26:22.860 align:start position:0%
add this to the distracted driving laws
 
06:26:25.430 --> 06:26:25.440 align:start position:0%
which is what all the other states that
 
06:26:26.930 --> 06:26:26.940 align:start position:0%
I mentioned to you
 
06:26:29.810 --> 06:26:29.820 align:start position:0%
all say none of them necessarily say you
 
06:26:32.208 --> 06:26:32.218 align:start position:0%
can't have the pet but they just have
 
06:26:34.548 --> 06:26:34.558 align:start position:0%
that if you get that they can pull you
 
06:26:36.470 --> 06:26:36.480 align:start position:0%
over for that
 
06:26:38.868 --> 06:26:38.878 align:start position:0%
um so the way this was written is it was
 
06:26:40.910 --> 06:26:40.920 align:start position:0%
basically just a new section but my
 
06:26:42.470 --> 06:26:42.480 align:start position:0%
understanding is yes it's going to be
 
06:26:44.390 --> 06:26:44.400 align:start position:0%
with the distracted driving laws which
 
06:26:48.948 --> 06:26:48.958 align:start position:0%
are mostly all cell phone and if I could
 
06:26:51.230 --> 06:26:51.240 align:start position:0%
just add to that one of the things that
 
06:26:53.628 --> 06:26:53.638 align:start position:0%
I've gotten from several officers that
 
06:26:55.788 --> 06:26:55.798 align:start position:0%
have called me which have been a lot I
 
06:26:58.010 --> 06:26:58.020 align:start position:0%
reached out to the police Chiefs in my
 
06:26:59.510 --> 06:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
town I've reached out to friends that I
 
06:27:01.610 --> 06:27:01.620 align:start position:0%
have that are officers every single
 
06:27:02.750 --> 06:27:02.760 align:start position:0%
person was in support of it and
 
06:27:04.128 --> 06:27:04.138 align:start position:0%
unfortunately they're all working so
 
06:27:05.868 --> 06:27:05.878 align:start position:0%
they're not here but the first thing
 
06:27:07.310 --> 06:27:07.320 align:start position:0%
that a lot of people said to me was why
 
06:27:09.470 --> 06:27:09.480 align:start position:0%
aren't you adding makeup okay I mean one
 
06:27:10.730 --> 06:27:10.740 align:start position:0%
thing at a time I mean I think it's
 
06:27:12.048 --> 06:27:12.058 align:start position:0%
foolish to drive down the road putting
 
06:27:13.788 --> 06:27:13.798 align:start position:0%
makeup on as well
 
06:27:15.410 --> 06:27:15.420 align:start position:0%
um but again a lot of people think that
 
06:27:17.270 --> 06:27:17.280 align:start position:0%
that's already illegal but apparently if
 
06:27:20.150 --> 06:27:20.160 align:start position:0%
it's not in writing it it doesn't count
 
06:27:22.310 --> 06:27:22.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:27:24.708 --> 06:27:24.718 align:start position:0%
represent representative sellers
 
06:27:26.570 --> 06:27:26.580 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
06:27:29.628 --> 06:27:29.638 align:start position:0%
who's going to determine that it's if
 
06:27:32.208 --> 06:27:32.218 align:start position:0%
the animals on are in the person's hands
 
06:27:34.970 --> 06:27:34.980 align:start position:0%
or arms a lap that it's impeding his or
 
06:27:36.650 --> 06:27:36.660 align:start position:0%
her access
 
06:27:38.030 --> 06:27:38.040 align:start position:0%
I mean
 
06:27:39.410 --> 06:27:39.420 align:start position:0%
it could be different for every every
 
06:27:41.628 --> 06:27:41.638 align:start position:0%
person well thank you for your question
 
06:27:43.788 --> 06:27:43.798 align:start position:0%
which is exactly why it says that
 
06:27:47.030 --> 06:27:47.040 align:start position:0%
basically the pet cannot be
 
06:27:49.670 --> 06:27:49.680 align:start position:0%
in the driver's area for for the exact
 
06:27:51.948 --> 06:27:51.958 align:start position:0%
reasons that you just said right if a
 
06:27:53.330 --> 06:27:53.340 align:start position:0%
person's driving down the road and the
 
06:27:55.910 --> 06:27:55.920 align:start position:0%
dog is on their arm well the dog's not
 
06:27:57.830 --> 06:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
on my lap so that's okay
 
06:28:01.128 --> 06:28:01.138 align:start position:0%
right so the end of the day the pet
 
06:28:01.138 --> 06:28:02.990 align:start position:0%
right so the end of the day the pet
being

06:28:02.990 --> 06:28:03.000 align:start position:0%
being
 
06:28:04.850 --> 06:28:04.860 align:start position:0%
with the driver
 
06:28:07.610 --> 06:28:07.620 align:start position:0%
is clearly a distraction and that is
 
06:28:09.170 --> 06:28:09.180 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to prevent we're
 
06:28:10.670 --> 06:28:10.680 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
06:28:13.310 --> 06:28:13.320 align:start position:0%
help the dog and the safety of the dog
 
06:28:16.910 --> 06:28:16.920 align:start position:0%
which is clearly not in its and it's
 
06:28:19.070 --> 06:28:19.080 align:start position:0%
safe being you know transported in its
 
06:28:21.830 --> 06:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
safest manner and it certainly is a
 
06:28:23.208 --> 06:28:23.218 align:start position:0%
distraction to be driving down the road
 
06:28:25.310 --> 06:28:25.320 align:start position:0%
and have something you know that's
 
06:28:33.410 --> 06:28:33.420 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:36.708 --> 06:28:36.718 align:start position:0%
of Hill thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
06:28:38.030 --> 06:28:38.040 align:start position:0%
you representatives for coming and
 
06:28:39.430 --> 06:28:39.440 align:start position:0%
visiting us
 
06:28:41.590 --> 06:28:41.600 align:start position:0%
is there any
 
06:28:44.390 --> 06:28:44.400 align:start position:0%
thoughts or exclusions for service
 
06:28:44.400 --> 06:28:45.830 align:start position:0%
thoughts or exclusions for service
animals

06:28:45.830 --> 06:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
animals
 
06:28:46.788 --> 06:28:46.798 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
06:28:46.798 --> 06:28:49.430 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
representative

06:28:49.430 --> 06:28:49.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:28:51.650 --> 06:28:51.660 align:start position:0%
the service animal can certainly be in
 
06:28:53.570 --> 06:28:53.580 align:start position:0%
your vehicle
 
06:28:55.730 --> 06:28:55.740 align:start position:0%
right the service animal can be on
 
06:28:57.890 --> 06:28:57.900 align:start position:0%
according to this legislation the
 
06:28:59.510 --> 06:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
service animal can be sitting on the
 
06:29:02.570 --> 06:29:02.580 align:start position:0%
passenger on the passenger seat
 
06:29:02.580 --> 06:29:04.010 align:start position:0%
passenger on the passenger seat
I

06:29:04.010 --> 06:29:04.020 align:start position:0%
I
 
06:29:06.590 --> 06:29:06.600 align:start position:0%
I don't think that it makes any more
 
06:29:09.288 --> 06:29:09.298 align:start position:0%
sense to have the the service animal be
 
06:29:11.150 --> 06:29:11.160 align:start position:0%
on your lap
 
06:29:12.830 --> 06:29:12.840 align:start position:0%
than it does to have it sitting right
 
06:29:15.650 --> 06:29:15.660 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:18.650 --> 06:29:18.660 align:start position:0%
I I would have to say no
 
06:29:20.208 --> 06:29:20.218 align:start position:0%
although I find it hard to believe that
 
06:29:21.948 --> 06:29:21.958 align:start position:0%
a real service animal would be sitting
 
06:29:22.910 --> 06:29:22.920 align:start position:0%
on the lap
 
06:29:24.410 --> 06:29:24.420 align:start position:0%
you used to be sitting right next to
 
06:29:26.030 --> 06:29:26.040 align:start position:0%
them but any other questions from the
 
06:29:26.040 --> 06:29:27.110 align:start position:0%
them but any other questions from the
committee

06:29:27.110 --> 06:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
committee
 
06:29:31.548 --> 06:29:31.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:34.128 --> 06:29:34.138 align:start position:0%
uh next up chair recognizes Eli Rivera
 
06:29:36.230 --> 06:29:36.240 align:start position:0%
in support of the bill looking for two
 
06:29:39.230 --> 06:29:39.240 align:start position:0%
minutes uh representing himself are you
 
06:29:41.330 --> 06:29:41.340 align:start position:0%
also a sheriff
 
06:29:41.340 --> 06:29:43.970 align:start position:0%
also a sheriff
greetings

06:29:43.970 --> 06:29:43.980 align:start position:0%
greetings
 
06:29:46.548 --> 06:29:46.558 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr representative Welch
 
06:29:47.868 --> 06:29:47.878 align:start position:0%
and the members of the committee my name
 
06:29:49.788 --> 06:29:49.798 align:start position:0%
is Ila Rivera and I'm the sheriff in
 
06:29:51.288 --> 06:29:51.298 align:start position:0%
Cheshire county and I've been to share
 
06:29:52.910 --> 06:29:52.920 align:start position:0%
for 11 years
 
06:29:55.368 --> 06:29:55.378 align:start position:0%
I support this bill for a number of
 
06:29:57.170 --> 06:29:57.180 align:start position:0%
reasons and and I'm going to bring up we
 
06:30:00.470 --> 06:30:00.480 align:start position:0%
currently have a statue on 265.95 that
 
06:30:02.208 --> 06:30:02.218 align:start position:0%
talks about the obstruction to Driver's
 
06:30:04.610 --> 06:30:04.620 align:start position:0%
view or writing mechanism and it
 
06:30:06.288 --> 06:30:06.298 align:start position:0%
actually has to deal with passengers so
 
06:30:09.170 --> 06:30:09.180 align:start position:0%
if you try to squeeze in four passengers
 
06:30:11.208 --> 06:30:11.218 align:start position:0%
in a in a three passenger seat like
 
06:30:13.250 --> 06:30:13.260 align:start position:0%
before you have the bench seats and you
 
06:30:14.810 --> 06:30:14.820 align:start position:0%
can try to squeeze as many people as you
 
06:30:16.548 --> 06:30:16.558 align:start position:0%
could in the front seat and you drive
 
06:30:19.850 --> 06:30:19.860 align:start position:0%
right against the the driver door and
 
06:30:21.350 --> 06:30:21.360 align:start position:0%
you're doing one of these numbers you
 
06:30:23.270 --> 06:30:23.280 align:start position:0%
know that was kind of what that bill
 
06:30:24.948 --> 06:30:24.958 align:start position:0%
came into
 
06:30:27.288 --> 06:30:27.298 align:start position:0%
um or you know you just have
 
06:30:28.850 --> 06:30:28.860 align:start position:0%
um people that are leaning against the
 
06:30:30.288 --> 06:30:30.298 align:start position:0%
driver as they're driving or so kind of
 
06:30:32.090 --> 06:30:32.100 align:start position:0%
obstructing how the driver can reach
 
06:30:34.430 --> 06:30:34.440 align:start position:0%
either the emergency brakes or even the
 
06:30:38.390 --> 06:30:38.400 align:start position:0%
gears or all the steering wheel itself
 
06:30:40.670 --> 06:30:40.680 align:start position:0%
um and it also talks about obstructing
 
06:30:42.708 --> 06:30:42.718 align:start position:0%
The View you know um if you have
 
06:30:44.690 --> 06:30:44.700 align:start position:0%
stickers or even tinted windows you know
 
06:30:46.548 --> 06:30:46.558 align:start position:0%
obstruct your way to look out the side
 
06:30:48.590 --> 06:30:48.600 align:start position:0%
mirrors inside
 
06:30:50.510 --> 06:30:50.520 align:start position:0%
um Windows you know it kind of there's a
 
06:30:52.490 --> 06:30:52.500 align:start position:0%
legislation that talks about and and
 
06:30:56.090 --> 06:30:56.100 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:59.750 --> 06:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
um pets have sometimes in our mind I've
 
06:31:01.610 --> 06:31:01.620 align:start position:0%
seen dogs running back and forth between
 
06:31:04.070 --> 06:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
the front seat the back seat looking out
 
06:31:05.628 --> 06:31:05.638 align:start position:0%
one window looking out the other window
 
06:31:07.788 --> 06:31:07.798 align:start position:0%
and and I seen
 
06:31:10.010 --> 06:31:10.020 align:start position:0%
um drivers of pets that are
 
06:31:11.750 --> 06:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
well they're holding with their left
 
06:31:13.490 --> 06:31:13.500 align:start position:0%
hand and they're trying to look over the
 
06:31:15.350 --> 06:31:15.360 align:start position:0%
over the dog as they're driving down the
 
06:31:18.410 --> 06:31:18.420 align:start position:0%
road so it does cause a hazard and then
 
06:31:21.230 --> 06:31:21.240 align:start position:0%
if we are saying that you cannot have
 
06:31:22.788 --> 06:31:22.798 align:start position:0%
um any something anything that strucks
 
06:31:24.470 --> 06:31:24.480 align:start position:0%
you view if you have
 
06:31:27.430 --> 06:31:27.440 align:start position:0%
a dog of whatever size you know it is
 
06:31:29.390 --> 06:31:29.400 align:start position:0%
obstructing your view because when you
 
06:31:31.430 --> 06:31:31.440 align:start position:0%
look it might be reflecting your side of
 
06:31:32.868 --> 06:31:32.878 align:start position:0%
your mirror it can be struck and as you
 
06:31:34.548 --> 06:31:34.558 align:start position:0%
look out because the dog is right there
 
06:31:37.368 --> 06:31:37.378 align:start position:0%
in your view and it just kind of creates
 
06:31:39.350 --> 06:31:39.360 align:start position:0%
that distraction
 
06:31:39.360 --> 06:31:40.670 align:start position:0%
that distraction
um

06:31:40.670 --> 06:31:40.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:31:42.830 --> 06:31:42.840 align:start position:0%
over the years I have stopped people
 
06:31:45.830 --> 06:31:45.840 align:start position:0%
because I felt that that watching a dog
 
06:31:47.750 --> 06:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
you know was just kind of in a position
 
06:31:49.670 --> 06:31:49.680 align:start position:0%
back in the days when I was in the
 
06:31:51.410 --> 06:31:51.420 align:start position:0%
patrol I pulled people over because I
 
06:31:53.690 --> 06:31:53.700 align:start position:0%
felt that you know
 
06:31:55.670 --> 06:31:55.680 align:start position:0%
I understand you love your dog but you
 
06:31:58.430 --> 06:31:58.440 align:start position:0%
know how can you even drive with that
 
06:32:00.410 --> 06:32:00.420 align:start position:0%
dog when you can't even see out the
 
06:32:02.270 --> 06:32:02.280 align:start position:0%
front window or out to the side you know
 
06:32:04.490 --> 06:32:04.500 align:start position:0%
you might want to consider
 
06:32:06.288 --> 06:32:06.298 align:start position:0%
um putting him somewhere else and and
 
06:32:08.150 --> 06:32:08.160 align:start position:0%
consider whether that was considered
 
06:32:09.830 --> 06:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
negligent drive you know how can you
 
06:32:11.090 --> 06:32:11.100 align:start position:0%
drive when you you're obstructing
 
06:32:13.730 --> 06:32:13.740 align:start position:0%
yourself from what's in front of you or
 
06:32:15.948 --> 06:32:15.958 align:start position:0%
into the side of you
 
06:32:17.448 --> 06:32:17.458 align:start position:0%
um whether it's a Chihuahua whether it's
 
06:32:19.548 --> 06:32:19.558 align:start position:0%
a lab I've seen it every size dogs on
 
06:32:20.868 --> 06:32:20.878 align:start position:0%
people's lives you know if you start
 
06:32:22.850 --> 06:32:22.860 align:start position:0%
talking about something that's more than
 
06:32:25.670 --> 06:32:25.680 align:start position:0%
a you know 30 pound dog or whatever you
 
06:32:27.410 --> 06:32:27.420 align:start position:0%
know then that that really gets in the
 
06:32:30.350 --> 06:32:30.360 align:start position:0%
way and when the representative um asks
 
06:32:33.708 --> 06:32:33.718 align:start position:0%
about the um the airbag you know the
 
06:32:36.948 --> 06:32:36.958 align:start position:0%
airbag is meant to protect the driver or
 
06:32:39.288 --> 06:32:39.298 align:start position:0%
the passenger in the car if you have a
 
06:32:41.448 --> 06:32:41.458 align:start position:0%
dog or something in between the airbag
 
06:32:44.090 --> 06:32:44.100 align:start position:0%
and the person with the air bag deploys
 
06:32:46.548 --> 06:32:46.558 align:start position:0%
now you're obstructing the real purpose
 
06:32:48.288 --> 06:32:48.298 align:start position:0%
of that airbag because you have put
 
06:32:50.208 --> 06:32:50.218 align:start position:0%
place in obstruction in between the
 
06:32:52.730 --> 06:32:52.740 align:start position:0%
passage the the driver of the passenger
 
06:32:54.770 --> 06:32:54.780 align:start position:0%
whoever that is and the air back and
 
06:32:56.208 --> 06:32:56.218 align:start position:0%
that's going to most likely cause more
 
06:32:58.970 --> 06:32:58.980 align:start position:0%
harm or reduce the capabilities of the
 
06:33:01.128 --> 06:33:01.138 align:start position:0%
airbag as it deploys because now it's
 
06:33:02.990 --> 06:33:03.000 align:start position:0%
facing a destruction instead of being
 
06:33:05.628 --> 06:33:05.638 align:start position:0%
hit by the airbag you can emit my airbag
 
06:33:07.250 --> 06:33:07.260 align:start position:0%
that's pushing your dog into your face
 
06:33:09.590 --> 06:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
or whatever that is you know so there's
 
06:33:11.330 --> 06:33:11.340 align:start position:0%
some more serious consequences when you
 
06:33:13.788 --> 06:33:13.798 align:start position:0%
have a dog in your lap and and hopefully
 
06:33:15.470 --> 06:33:15.480 align:start position:0%
nothing ever happens but that airbag
 
06:33:17.208 --> 06:33:17.218 align:start position:0%
doesn't pause you're going to be hit
 
06:33:19.250 --> 06:33:19.260 align:start position:0%
with a lot more weight behind it because
 
06:33:20.628 --> 06:33:20.638 align:start position:0%
now you have something something
 
06:33:22.850 --> 06:33:22.860 align:start position:0%
obstructing it
 
06:33:24.650 --> 06:33:24.660 align:start position:0%
um again we have
 
06:33:26.750 --> 06:33:26.760 align:start position:0%
um legislation that does deal with the
 
06:33:28.730 --> 06:33:28.740 align:start position:0%
obstruction of you and and obstructing
 
06:33:31.128 --> 06:33:31.138 align:start position:0%
the driver's mechanism already in place
 
06:33:34.190 --> 06:33:34.200 align:start position:0%
adding that in addition to passengers or
 
06:33:36.110 --> 06:33:36.120 align:start position:0%
or any other
 
06:33:38.868 --> 06:33:38.878 align:start position:0%
item that you put on on your window that
 
06:33:42.170 --> 06:33:42.180 align:start position:0%
dogs can also cause that obstruction and
 
06:33:42.180 --> 06:33:43.250 align:start position:0%
dogs can also cause that obstruction and
and

06:33:43.250 --> 06:33:43.260 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:33:52.730 --> 06:33:52.740 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:54.470 --> 06:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
thank you very much any questions from
 
06:33:56.090 --> 06:33:56.100 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
06:33:59.208 --> 06:33:59.218 align:start position:0%
seeing then thank you again
 
06:34:02.628 --> 06:34:02.638 align:start position:0%
uh next up
 
06:34:04.610 --> 06:34:04.620 align:start position:0%
Lieutenant O'Leary
 
06:34:07.310 --> 06:34:07.320 align:start position:0%
from New Hampshire State Police Troop G
 
06:34:09.770 --> 06:34:09.780 align:start position:0%
uh no not taking a position on the bill
 
06:34:12.708 --> 06:34:12.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:14.030 --> 06:34:14.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair members of the
 
06:34:14.040 --> 06:34:15.770 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair members of the
committee

06:34:15.770 --> 06:34:15.780 align:start position:0%
committee
 
06:34:17.390 --> 06:34:17.400 align:start position:0%
um representative Rhodes to the
 
06:34:20.090 --> 06:34:20.100 align:start position:0%
phenomenal job setting this the uh this
 
06:34:21.650 --> 06:34:21.660 align:start position:0%
whole thing up because
 
06:34:23.750 --> 06:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
although we are not taking a position on
 
06:34:25.970 --> 06:34:25.980 align:start position:0%
this I think one of the things to
 
06:34:27.770 --> 06:34:27.780 align:start position:0%
um to understand and the point that she
 
06:34:30.410 --> 06:34:30.420 align:start position:0%
brought up being that our hands are
 
06:34:31.970 --> 06:34:31.980 align:start position:0%
somewhat tied when it comes to
 
06:34:33.650 --> 06:34:33.660 align:start position:0%
distracted driving and I think just by
 
06:34:35.390 --> 06:34:35.400 align:start position:0%
the nature of the term distracted
 
06:34:37.788 --> 06:34:37.798 align:start position:0%
driving the general public thinks that
 
06:34:40.430 --> 06:34:40.440 align:start position:0%
you know we have an authority to act on
 
06:34:42.410 --> 06:34:42.420 align:start position:0%
people who are distracted and and it's
 
06:34:44.330 --> 06:34:44.340 align:start position:0%
uh it's complicated it's a complicated
 
06:34:46.670 --> 06:34:46.680 align:start position:0%
matter there are only a couple of laws
 
06:34:49.070 --> 06:34:49.080 align:start position:0%
that specifically speak to distracted
 
06:34:51.410 --> 06:34:51.420 align:start position:0%
driving one being when you're using a
 
06:34:53.270 --> 06:34:53.280 align:start position:0%
cell phone and one being when you're
 
06:34:55.910 --> 06:34:55.920 align:start position:0%
texting those two specifically speak to
 
06:34:58.850 --> 06:34:58.860 align:start position:0%
to distracted driving now outside of
 
06:35:01.070 --> 06:35:01.080 align:start position:0%
that we have negligent driving and
 
06:35:02.990 --> 06:35:03.000 align:start position:0%
negligent driving is for someone who
 
06:35:05.208 --> 06:35:05.218 align:start position:0%
drives a vehicle that in a manner in
 
06:35:07.788 --> 06:35:07.798 align:start position:0%
which could cause uh harm to a person or
 
06:35:10.070 --> 06:35:10.080 align:start position:0%
property the difficult part in that law
 
06:35:14.390 --> 06:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
is that deciphering or articulating that
 
06:35:17.208 --> 06:35:17.218 align:start position:0%
event of is potentially could cause an
 
06:35:19.910 --> 06:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
issue so for example if I have somebody
 
06:35:21.590 --> 06:35:21.600 align:start position:0%
who is eating an ice cream and Crosses
 
06:35:23.270 --> 06:35:23.280 align:start position:0%
is over the yellow line and strike
 
06:35:25.070 --> 06:35:25.080 align:start position:0%
somebody I can certainly articulate that
 
06:35:27.230 --> 06:35:27.240 align:start position:0%
they're driving negligently however if I
 
06:35:29.510 --> 06:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
have someone eating an ice cream you
 
06:35:30.948 --> 06:35:30.958 align:start position:0%
know and only not paying attention only
 
06:35:32.868 --> 06:35:32.878 align:start position:0%
having one hand on the wheel that's not
 
06:35:34.730 --> 06:35:34.740 align:start position:0%
something I could stop them for as being
 
06:35:37.010 --> 06:35:37.020 align:start position:0%
distracted so in the case of an animal
 
06:35:38.330 --> 06:35:38.340 align:start position:0%
or anything that's going to be a
 
06:35:40.310 --> 06:35:40.320 align:start position:0%
distraction in this in this case being
 
06:35:41.170 --> 06:35:41.180 align:start position:0%
an animal
 
06:35:44.270 --> 06:35:44.280 align:start position:0%
we don't have a distracted driving law
 
06:35:45.890 --> 06:35:45.900 align:start position:0%
and and I think representative Rhodes
 
06:35:47.690 --> 06:35:47.700 align:start position:0%
did a great job of trying to to bring
 
06:35:49.670 --> 06:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
that to your attention because we again
 
06:35:51.410 --> 06:35:51.420 align:start position:0%
that's something that most people think
 
06:35:53.628 --> 06:35:53.638 align:start position:0%
that we have and we don't have
 
06:35:57.770 --> 06:35:57.780 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:59.390 --> 06:35:59.400 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much questions
 
06:36:01.128 --> 06:36:01.138 align:start position:0%
from the committee representative St
 
06:36:01.138 --> 06:36:03.948 align:start position:0%
from the committee representative St
Claire

06:36:03.948 --> 06:36:03.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:06.048 --> 06:36:06.058 align:start position:0%
I like to keep you busy I this is a
 
06:36:08.170 --> 06:36:08.180 align:start position:0%
question and we spoke earlier about this
 
06:36:11.030 --> 06:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
in your experience all the years on the
 
06:36:13.730 --> 06:36:13.740 align:start position:0%
force would you give up
 
06:36:16.190 --> 06:36:16.200 align:start position:0%
a shout out at maybe the percentage of
 
06:36:18.048 --> 06:36:18.058 align:start position:0%
people you think actually drive around
 
06:36:18.058 --> 06:36:19.368 align:start position:0%
people you think actually drive around
with

06:36:19.368 --> 06:36:19.378 align:start position:0%
with
 
06:36:22.850 --> 06:36:22.860 align:start position:0%
animals on their laps just just a guess
 
06:36:25.368 --> 06:36:25.378 align:start position:0%
so thank you for your question that's a
 
06:36:27.230 --> 06:36:27.240 align:start position:0%
difficult question I have seen it and I
 
06:36:28.310 --> 06:36:28.320 align:start position:0%
have seen people that have you know
 
06:36:30.048 --> 06:36:30.058 align:start position:0%
driven over the yellow line and such so
 
06:36:31.850 --> 06:36:31.860 align:start position:0%
those are you know circumstances which
 
06:36:34.368 --> 06:36:34.378 align:start position:0%
I'm acting on that secondary violation I
 
06:36:35.868 --> 06:36:35.878 align:start position:0%
you know I see the distraction not
 
06:36:37.310 --> 06:36:37.320 align:start position:0%
anything I can act on but I do see him
 
06:36:38.930 --> 06:36:38.940 align:start position:0%
cross the yellow line it is something
 
06:36:41.170 --> 06:36:41.180 align:start position:0%
that I have seen throughout my 20 years
 
06:36:43.310 --> 06:36:43.320 align:start position:0%
that being said I do know that
 
06:36:44.868 --> 06:36:44.878 align:start position:0%
distracted driving is one of the number
 
06:36:46.970 --> 06:36:46.980 align:start position:0%
one issues that we have in our state and
 
06:36:48.890 --> 06:36:48.900 align:start position:0%
across the country so
 
06:36:50.690 --> 06:36:50.700 align:start position:0%
um you know the difficult part is we
 
06:36:52.548 --> 06:36:52.558 align:start position:0%
don't capture information related to
 
06:36:54.590 --> 06:36:54.600 align:start position:0%
what the distraction is so if somebody's
 
06:36:56.868 --> 06:36:56.878 align:start position:0%
involved in a crash we show up we
 
06:36:58.910 --> 06:36:58.920 align:start position:0%
investigate we say yep it's uh you know
 
06:37:00.708 --> 06:37:00.718 align:start position:0%
contributing factors distracted driving
 
06:37:02.750 --> 06:37:02.760 align:start position:0%
that could be anything anything that's a
 
06:37:02.760 --> 06:37:04.490 align:start position:0%
that could be anything anything that's a
distraction

06:37:04.490 --> 06:37:04.500 align:start position:0%
distraction
 
06:37:05.810 --> 06:37:05.820 align:start position:0%
you're welcome thank you for your
 
06:37:06.910 --> 06:37:06.920 align:start position:0%
question what are the questions
 
06:37:09.350 --> 06:37:09.360 align:start position:0%
representative Coker uh thank you Mr
 
06:37:11.330 --> 06:37:11.340 align:start position:0%
chairman Lieutenant so a quick question
 
06:37:13.368 --> 06:37:13.378 align:start position:0%
I have so we the this you said
 
06:37:14.690 --> 06:37:14.700 align:start position:0%
distracted driving is kind of a
 
06:37:17.990 --> 06:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
secondary if I guess um offense you
 
06:37:21.650 --> 06:37:21.660 align:start position:0%
so the two laws that we have uh are for
 
06:37:23.208 --> 06:37:23.218 align:start position:0%
cell phone uses essentially whether
 
06:37:25.190 --> 06:37:25.200 align:start position:0%
you're hands-free or text messaging the
 
06:37:27.410 --> 06:37:27.420 align:start position:0%
negligent driving is is essentially the
 
06:37:29.628 --> 06:37:29.638 align:start position:0%
the captures anything that is as a
 
06:37:32.570 --> 06:37:32.580 align:start position:0%
result of distracted driving okay so do
 
06:37:34.788 --> 06:37:34.798 align:start position:0%
you think like maybe instead of um you
 
06:37:36.110 --> 06:37:36.120 align:start position:0%
know there's I feel like there might be
 
06:37:38.330 --> 06:37:38.340 align:start position:0%
like a lot of one-off situations where
 
06:37:40.128 --> 06:37:40.138 align:start position:0%
you're kind of adding you know like we
 
06:37:42.890 --> 06:37:42.900 align:start position:0%
had a bill for a dog in the lab stuff
 
06:37:45.708 --> 06:37:45.718 align:start position:0%
like that you think this might be an
 
06:37:48.470 --> 06:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
opportunity to possibly roll in just a
 
06:37:50.990 --> 06:37:51.000 align:start position:0%
blanket distracted driving type of
 
06:37:53.150 --> 06:37:53.160 align:start position:0%
legislation I mean with that I guess
 
06:37:54.530 --> 06:37:54.540 align:start position:0%
would would that help with enforcement
 
06:37:56.390 --> 06:37:56.400 align:start position:0%
or at least being able for you guys
 
06:37:58.310 --> 06:37:58.320 align:start position:0%
being able to pull people over for these
 
06:38:00.708 --> 06:38:00.718 align:start position:0%
issues and have you know basically
 
06:38:02.628 --> 06:38:02.638 align:start position:0%
having a legislative backing for it yeah
 
06:38:04.150 --> 06:38:04.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question right so
 
06:38:07.070 --> 06:38:07.080 align:start position:0%
that I I agree if we could find
 
06:38:09.350 --> 06:38:09.360 align:start position:0%
something that would you know basically
 
06:38:11.690 --> 06:38:11.700 align:start position:0%
capture all of those instances that
 
06:38:13.128 --> 06:38:13.138 align:start position:0%
would be awesome
 
06:38:15.530 --> 06:38:15.540 align:start position:0%
um however that obviously is challenging
 
06:38:17.390 --> 06:38:17.400 align:start position:0%
to be able to articulate what exactly is
 
06:38:19.010 --> 06:38:19.020 align:start position:0%
going to be straight distracting and not
 
06:38:21.048 --> 06:38:21.058 align:start position:0%
so if if the committee believes that
 
06:38:22.788 --> 06:38:22.798 align:start position:0%
we're able to capture that that would be
 
06:38:24.530 --> 06:38:24.540 align:start position:0%
great if we can capture this along with
 
06:38:26.150 --> 06:38:26.160 align:start position:0%
other distracted driving in some sort of
 
06:38:26.160 --> 06:38:27.890 align:start position:0%
other distracted driving in some sort of
legislation

06:38:27.890 --> 06:38:27.900 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
06:38:29.390 --> 06:38:29.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for question
 
06:38:31.610 --> 06:38:31.620 align:start position:0%
committees representative sellers thank
 
06:38:36.350 --> 06:38:36.360 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair so if we go that way uh
 
06:38:38.510 --> 06:38:38.520 align:start position:0%
I could be drinking a coffee in an
 
06:38:40.368 --> 06:38:40.378 align:start position:0%
office officer could see me and said
 
06:38:42.590 --> 06:38:42.600 align:start position:0%
you're distracted is that true
 
06:38:45.770 --> 06:38:45.780 align:start position:0%
if that's again where that's kind of a
 
06:38:47.990 --> 06:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
hypothetical proposal to legislation and
 
06:38:49.788 --> 06:38:49.798 align:start position:0%
I think that that's that's why we've
 
06:38:51.350 --> 06:38:51.360 align:start position:0%
gone with the negligent driving charge
 
06:38:52.730 --> 06:38:52.740 align:start position:0%
for so long because you could be
 
06:38:54.890 --> 06:38:54.900 align:start position:0%
drinking a coffee and uh and and
 
06:38:56.628 --> 06:38:56.638 align:start position:0%
nothing's happening but you could be
 
06:38:58.430 --> 06:38:58.440 align:start position:0%
reaching for that coffee and it spills
 
06:38:59.690 --> 06:38:59.700 align:start position:0%
in your lap and you cross the yellow
 
06:39:01.190 --> 06:39:01.200 align:start position:0%
line and hit somebody and now it's
 
06:39:02.990 --> 06:39:03.000 align:start position:0%
become negligent so it's that fine line
 
06:39:05.090 --> 06:39:05.100 align:start position:0%
between being distracted and what it you
 
06:39:06.470 --> 06:39:06.480 align:start position:0%
know what contributes to something
 
06:39:08.090 --> 06:39:08.100 align:start position:0%
that's negligent
 
06:39:11.330 --> 06:39:11.340 align:start position:0%
foreign any other questions
 
06:39:13.850 --> 06:39:13.860 align:start position:0%
I just have one so in summary obvious
 
06:39:15.590 --> 06:39:15.600 align:start position:0%
the negligences and after the fact
 
06:39:18.770 --> 06:39:18.780 align:start position:0%
charge yes sir and and you could
 
06:39:20.690 --> 06:39:20.700 align:start position:0%
uh probably charge somebody with
 
06:39:23.030 --> 06:39:23.040 align:start position:0%
negligence if you found the dog in
 
06:39:24.410 --> 06:39:24.420 align:start position:0%
between the steering wheel and the human
 
06:39:27.170 --> 06:39:27.180 align:start position:0%
being and so so that's pretty simple my
 
06:39:28.610 --> 06:39:28.620 align:start position:0%
question is
 
06:39:30.590 --> 06:39:30.600 align:start position:0%
do you think that the language that the
 
06:39:31.788 --> 06:39:31.798 align:start position:0%
way it's currently written would be
 
06:39:35.930 --> 06:39:35.940 align:start position:0%
enforceable for the for preventing it
 
06:39:37.850 --> 06:39:37.860 align:start position:0%
from from the distraction part of it
 
06:39:40.368 --> 06:39:40.378 align:start position:0%
from what I've read I mean on its face
 
06:39:42.230 --> 06:39:42.240 align:start position:0%
value it's simply if the dogs in the lap
 
06:39:44.810 --> 06:39:44.820 align:start position:0%
it's a violation and I think that if the
 
06:39:46.670 --> 06:39:46.680 align:start position:0%
committee finds that that's a you know a
 
06:39:48.470 --> 06:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
level distraction I think that that's uh
 
06:39:50.570 --> 06:39:50.580 align:start position:0%
that's pretty easy to be able to enforce
 
06:39:53.750 --> 06:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
on our end okay all right thank you
 
06:39:55.910 --> 06:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
um seeing no other questions thank you
 
06:39:57.890 --> 06:39:57.900 align:start position:0%
very much thank you sir uh no other pink
 
06:39:59.090 --> 06:39:59.100 align:start position:0%
cards I'm going to close the public
 
06:40:00.590 --> 06:40:00.600 align:start position:0%
hearing on
 
06:40:07.548 --> 06:40:07.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:10.010 --> 06:40:10.020 align:start position:0%
okay so that's the end of our business
 
06:40:10.020 --> 06:40:12.830 align:start position:0%
okay so that's the end of our business
today

06:40:12.830 --> 06:40:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:15.770 --> 06:40:15.780 align:start position:0%
I will be scheduling our early bills for
 
06:40:17.750 --> 06:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
next Tuesday
 
06:40:20.570 --> 06:40:20.580 align:start position:0%
um we've got seven of them actually the
 
06:40:22.190 --> 06:40:22.200 align:start position:0%
way we went today maybe that's all we're
 
06:40:24.948 --> 06:40:24.958 align:start position:0%
going to do next week is seven any other
 
06:40:27.650 --> 06:40:27.660 align:start position:0%
questions for me before we finish our
 
06:40:31.010 --> 06:40:31.020 align:start position:0%
business for the day what time Tuesday
 
06:40:33.230 --> 06:40:33.240 align:start position:0%
excuse me what time Tuesday
 
06:40:35.830 --> 06:40:35.840 align:start position:0%
um I typically I like to start early
 
06:40:38.868 --> 06:40:38.878 align:start position:0%
nine o'clock usually
 
06:40:41.208 --> 06:40:41.218 align:start position:0%
it won't be any earlier than that
 
06:40:43.250 --> 06:40:43.260 align:start position:0%
um but it depends on what I'll have to
 
06:40:44.330 --> 06:40:44.340 align:start position:0%
look at the bills if I think they're
 
06:40:47.270 --> 06:40:47.280 align:start position:0%
easy like I did today or how'd that work
 
06:40:50.448 --> 06:40:50.458 align:start position:0%
um I move it to ten but I think I think
 
06:40:53.830 --> 06:40:53.840 align:start position:0%
safe and safe enough uh
 
06:40:56.930 --> 06:40:56.940 align:start position:0%
we'll probably be starting at nine I'll
 
06:40:58.970 --> 06:40:58.980 align:start position:0%
speak with the ranking member also about
 
06:41:00.770 --> 06:41:00.780 align:start position:0%
any of the bills that we've heard today
 
06:41:02.390 --> 06:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
whether or not we want to exec them next
 
06:41:02.400 --> 06:41:03.770 align:start position:0%
whether or not we want to exec them next
week

06:41:03.770 --> 06:41:03.780 align:start position:0%
week
 
06:41:06.230 --> 06:41:06.240 align:start position:0%
um but the ones we heard today are not
 
06:41:09.048 --> 06:41:09.058 align:start position:0%
early so those aren't under a deadline
 
06:41:11.868 --> 06:41:11.878 align:start position:0%
yet so the next week's public herd bills
 
06:41:14.810 --> 06:41:14.820 align:start position:0%
are go ahead
 
06:41:18.048 --> 06:41:18.058 align:start position:0%
the three bills before us that are that
 
06:41:19.490 --> 06:41:19.500 align:start position:0%
we didn't act on today will they be
 
06:41:21.530 --> 06:41:21.540 align:start position:0%
agendaized for next Tuesday excuse me
 
06:41:24.708 --> 06:41:24.718 align:start position:0%
excuse me guys
 
06:41:27.650 --> 06:41:27.660 align:start position:0%
I didn't hear you excuse me
 
06:41:32.090 --> 06:41:32.100 align:start position:0%
gentlemen I can't hear please thank you
 
06:41:34.070 --> 06:41:34.080 align:start position:0%
no not yet I'm answering some so one
 
06:41:35.208 --> 06:41:35.218 align:start position:0%
more time no I'm just asking that
 
06:41:37.190 --> 06:41:37.200 align:start position:0%
there's three bills that were before us
 
06:41:38.990 --> 06:41:39.000 align:start position:0%
today that we are they going to be
 
06:41:41.030 --> 06:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
agendized for next Tuesday those bills I
 
06:41:42.230 --> 06:41:42.240 align:start position:0%
didn't even notice that we had three
 
06:41:43.850 --> 06:41:43.860 align:start position:0%
extra I just worked off the ones that I
 
06:41:45.230 --> 06:41:45.240 align:start position:0%
scheduled last week okay yeah I don't
 
06:41:46.730 --> 06:41:46.740 align:start position:0%
know why they're there okay you just put
 
06:41:50.330 --> 06:41:50.340 align:start position:0%
extra ones typically we might typically
 
06:41:52.368 --> 06:41:52.378 align:start position:0%
we get a copy of all of them from from
 
06:41:54.288 --> 06:41:54.298 align:start position:0%
committee Services
 
06:41:56.090 --> 06:41:56.100 align:start position:0%
um but I though things may be changing
 
06:41:57.350 --> 06:41:57.360 align:start position:0%
there because I know things are trying
 
06:41:59.690 --> 06:41:59.700 align:start position:0%
to go paperless so I'll confirm whether
 
06:42:00.830 --> 06:42:00.840 align:start position:0%
or not we're going to get a copy
 
06:42:02.750 --> 06:42:02.760 align:start position:0%
typically most of the representatives
 
06:42:05.690 --> 06:42:05.700 align:start position:0%
keep an index file and keep them all
 
06:42:07.730 --> 06:42:07.740 align:start position:0%
with all your notes um I still like
 
06:42:09.830 --> 06:42:09.840 align:start position:0%
doing it that way myself but I'll follow
 
06:42:12.590 --> 06:42:12.600 align:start position:0%
up and uh if you would like copies you
 
06:42:14.150 --> 06:42:14.160 align:start position:0%
can certainly request them from Lindsay
 
06:42:16.850 --> 06:42:16.860 align:start position:0%
uh yourself but
 
06:42:18.830 --> 06:42:18.840 align:start position:0%
while we have more bills we have 23
 
06:42:21.530 --> 06:42:21.540 align:start position:0%
totals so and I think we've only got it
 
06:42:24.708 --> 06:42:24.718 align:start position:0%
yeah so um representative Rumble I saw
 
06:42:26.930 --> 06:42:26.940 align:start position:0%
you you had a question no
 
06:42:26.940 --> 06:42:28.670 align:start position:0%
you you had a question no
okay
