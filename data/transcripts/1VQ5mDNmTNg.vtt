00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:32.720 align:start position:0%
we live in a world that has been widely
 
00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:37.280 align:start position:0%
impacted by covet 19 since february
 
00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:40.960 align:start position:0%
2020 every person in the united states
 
00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:43.600 align:start position:0%
has been impacted by the virus
 
00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:46.880 align:start position:0%
whether it be through infection directly
 
00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
or infection of their loved ones or
 
00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:52.320 align:start position:0%
through government impact on their lives
 
00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:54.720 align:start position:0%
in an attempt to stop the spread
 
00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:57.360 align:start position:0%
for a significant amount of time
 
00:05:59.749 --> 00:05:59.759 align:start position:0%
treatments and preventative measures
 
00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:01.600 align:start position:0%
have been well known to the general
 
00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:02.550 align:start position:0%
have been well known to the general
public

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:02.560 align:start position:0%
public
 
00:06:05.029 --> 00:06:05.039 align:start position:0%
people are aware of the risks and
 
00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:07.280 align:start position:0%
dangers of the virus and have the
 
00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
freedom to make their own decisions and
 
00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:13.440 align:start position:0%
how to best mitigate those risks
 
00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:15.440 align:start position:0%
again for almost
 
00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:17.919 align:start position:0%
two years we've been living through this
 
00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:19.350 align:start position:0%
two years we've been living through this
pandemic

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:19.360 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
00:06:22.629 --> 00:06:22.639 align:start position:0%
laws must be made through the regular
 
00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:25.000 align:start position:0%
legislative process
 
00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:27.520 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional vaccine mandates are
 
00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:30.880 align:start position:0%
coercing people into medical decisions
 
00:06:33.029 --> 00:06:33.039 align:start position:0%
right here in new hampshire
 
00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:35.039 align:start position:0%
one of the saddest things as a
 
00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
legislator has been
 
00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:39.120 align:start position:0%
calls from mothers
 
00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:41.120 align:start position:0%
who are in tears
 
00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:43.280 align:start position:0%
because they are choosing between taking
 
00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:47.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:50.080 align:start position:0%
or putting food on the table for their
 
00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:52.230 align:start position:0%
or putting food on the table for their
child

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:52.240 align:start position:0%
child
 
00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:54.720 align:start position:0%
our healthcare workers that were hailed
 
00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:56.560 align:start position:0%
as heroes
 
00:06:58.469 --> 00:06:58.479 align:start position:0%
not that long ago
 
00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:00.880 align:start position:0%
are now sadly being fired
 
00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:03.440 align:start position:0%
if they don't take the vaccine
 
00:07:06.629 --> 00:07:06.639 align:start position:0%
again right here in new hampshire
 
00:07:08.469 --> 00:07:08.479 align:start position:0%
people are asking
 
00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:10.880 align:start position:0%
how are we standing up
 
00:07:13.909 --> 00:07:13.919 align:start position:0%
for our health care heroes
 
00:07:15.749 --> 00:07:15.759 align:start position:0%
and let me be clear
 
00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:18.880 align:start position:0%
politicians and bureaucrats that violate
 
00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:21.560 align:start position:0%
our medical freedom by enforcing
 
00:07:25.029 --> 00:07:25.039 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional and unlawful mandates
 
00:07:27.749 --> 00:07:27.759 align:start position:0%
should go to prison
 
00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:30.880 align:start position:0%
the legislative process is sacred
 
00:07:33.749 --> 00:07:33.759 align:start position:0%
president joe biden is not a king
 
00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:36.160 align:start position:0%
and the executive departments cannot
 
00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:39.440 align:start position:0%
subvert the legislative process when it
 
00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:40.960 align:start position:0%
is convenient
 
00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:42.880 align:start position:0%
it is up to individual
 
00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:44.800 align:start position:0%
state legislatures
 
00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:47.360 align:start position:0%
and the united states congress to enact
 
00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:51.280 align:start position:0%
legislation that impacts the citizens
 
00:07:53.749 --> 00:07:53.759 align:start position:0%
executive orders written by the
 
00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:56.000 align:start position:0%
current administration have given the
 
00:07:59.589 --> 00:07:59.599 align:start position:0%
authority to osha to require employees
 
00:08:02.309 --> 00:08:02.319 align:start position:0%
to force medical interventions on their
 
00:08:02.319 --> 00:08:04.150 align:start position:0%
to force medical interventions on their
employees

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:04.160 align:start position:0%
employees
 
00:08:06.469 --> 00:08:06.479 align:start position:0%
it is well within the authority of the
 
00:08:08.629 --> 00:08:08.639 align:start position:0%
general court to protect its
 
00:08:08.639 --> 00:08:10.309 align:start position:0%
general court to protect its
constituents

00:08:10.309 --> 00:08:10.319 align:start position:0%
constituents
 
00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:13.120 align:start position:0%
from overreach of federal executive
 
00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:14.469 align:start position:0%
from overreach of federal executive
power

00:08:14.469 --> 00:08:14.479 align:start position:0%
power
 
00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:16.720 align:start position:0%
this bill aims to check the power of the
 
00:08:18.869 --> 00:08:18.879 align:start position:0%
federal government and to defend the
 
00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:20.720 align:start position:0%
people of our state from
 
00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:22.550 align:start position:0%
people of our state from
unconstitutional

00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional
 
00:08:25.029 --> 00:08:25.039 align:start position:0%
executive actions and decrees
 
00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
that encroach
 
00:08:28.629 --> 00:08:28.639 align:start position:0%
on their ability to conduct business
 
00:08:28.639 --> 00:08:29.749 align:start position:0%
on their ability to conduct business
freely

00:08:29.749 --> 00:08:29.759 align:start position:0%
freely
 
00:08:32.469 --> 00:08:32.479 align:start position:0%
this bill protects the right of private
 
00:08:35.269 --> 00:08:35.279 align:start position:0%
businesses to make their own decisions
 
00:08:37.829 --> 00:08:37.839 align:start position:0%
and what they require of their employees
 
00:08:40.310 --> 00:08:40.320 align:start position:0%
and frees them from being shackled by
 
00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:43.200 align:start position:0%
executive overreach
 
00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
we are at a tipping point
 
00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:47.200 align:start position:0%
the rights of the people of the state of
 
00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:50.160 align:start position:0%
new hampshire need to be safeguarded by
 
00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:51.360 align:start position:0%
this body
 
00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:53.120 align:start position:0%
the federal government through a
 
00:08:56.230 --> 00:08:56.240 align:start position:0%
grotesque amount of executive overreach
 
00:08:58.870 --> 00:08:58.880 align:start position:0%
has overstepped its constitutional
 
00:08:58.880 --> 00:08:59.910 align:start position:0%
has overstepped its constitutional
authority

00:08:59.910 --> 00:08:59.920 align:start position:0%
authority
 
00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:03.200 align:start position:0%
by directly disrupting the ability of
 
00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:05.680 align:start position:0%
the people of new hampshire to conduct
 
00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
business as a free people at this point
 
00:09:11.829 --> 00:09:11.839 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to take any questions about hb
 
00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:17.680 align:start position:0%

00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
the legislative process is a core
 
00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:33.440 align:start position:0%
process of our democracy
 
00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:34.870 align:start position:0%
process of our democracy
and

00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:34.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:37.200 align:start position:0%
a lot of people may think of
 
00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:40.310 align:start position:0%
a lot of people may think of
um

00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:43.440 align:start position:0%
treason as helping a foreign state
 
00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:44.800 align:start position:0%
but in fact
 
00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:46.720 align:start position:0%
not only is it helping a foreign state
 
00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
but undermining the core of our actual
 
00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:52.949 align:start position:0%
but undermining the core of our actual
state

00:10:52.949 --> 00:10:52.959 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:10:52.959 --> 00:10:53.910 align:start position:0%
state
and

00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:53.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
there are some people
 
00:10:58.069 --> 00:10:58.079 align:start position:0%
who wish to subvert
 
00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:00.640 align:start position:0%
that core aspect of the legislative
 
00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:01.990 align:start position:0%
that core aspect of the legislative
process

00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:04.240 align:start position:0%
in our country
 
00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:05.200 align:start position:0%
and that
 
00:11:09.829 --> 00:11:09.839 align:start position:0%
should be taken with the most utmost
 
00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:17.110 align:start position:0%
 
the

00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:17.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:11:19.829 --> 00:11:19.839 align:start position:0%
use of
 
00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:21.440 align:start position:0%
coven 19
 
00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:24.320 align:start position:0%
this far into a pandemic
 
00:11:26.829 --> 00:11:26.839 align:start position:0%
is not a
 
00:11:30.069 --> 00:11:30.079 align:start position:0%
legitimate claim of emergency the claim
 
00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:32.640 align:start position:0%
of emergencies that
 
00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:35.440 align:start position:0%
that go around our legislative process
 
00:11:38.069 --> 00:11:38.079 align:start position:0%
are used
 
00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:40.640 align:start position:0%
so that in a short amount of time that
 
00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
people can react to
 
00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:46.160 align:start position:0%
changing circumstance but two years into
 
00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:48.880 align:start position:0%
a pandemic the legislature has ample
 
00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:49.750 align:start position:0%
a pandemic the legislature has ample
time

00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:49.760 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:50.470 align:start position:0%
time
to

00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:50.480 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:51.509 align:start position:0%
to
assess

00:11:51.509 --> 00:11:51.519 align:start position:0%
assess
 
00:11:51.519 --> 00:11:52.470 align:start position:0%
assess
and

00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:52.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:53.829 align:start position:0%
and
respond

00:11:53.829 --> 00:11:53.839 align:start position:0%
respond
 
00:11:56.389 --> 00:11:56.399 align:start position:0%
legislatively and so going around that
 
00:11:58.310 --> 00:11:58.320 align:start position:0%
legislative process
 
00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:00.800 align:start position:0%
is now
 
00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:03.430 align:start position:0%
is now
unwarranted

00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:03.440 align:start position:0%
unwarranted
 
00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:06.480 align:start position:0%
and that is why
 
00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:07.829 align:start position:0%
and that is why
uses

00:12:07.829 --> 00:12:07.839 align:start position:0%
uses
 
00:12:09.590 --> 00:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
of whether it be
 
00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:11.680 align:start position:0%
the osha mandate or something that
 
00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:13.680 align:start position:0%
someone comes up tomorrow or the next
 
00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:15.670 align:start position:0%
someone comes up tomorrow or the next
day

00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:15.680 align:start position:0%
day
 
00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
claims of emergency
 
00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:21.040 align:start position:0%
and giving emergency power for new
 
00:12:23.509 --> 00:12:23.519 align:start position:0%

under
 
00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:26.320 align:start position:0%
that doesn't go through the normal
 
00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
hearing process
 
00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.750 align:start position:0%
hearing process
and

00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:29.760 align:start position:0%

00:12:31.509 --> 00:12:31.519 align:start position:0%
being heard by the general public and
 
00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:33.680 align:start position:0%

00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:35.440 align:start position:0%
normal things that a legislative process
 
00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:36.949 align:start position:0%
normal things that a legislative process
has

00:12:36.949 --> 00:12:36.959 align:start position:0%

should be held accountable
 
00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:53.200 align:start position:0%
and anyone that enforces any such rule
 
00:12:57.829 --> 00:12:57.839 align:start position:0%

england new hampshire born here in
 
00:13:40.949 --> 00:13:40.959 align:start position:0%
concord new hampshire
 
00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:43.040 align:start position:0%
a long time ago
 
00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:45.760 align:start position:0%
i used to be a very proud citizen of new
 
00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:48.720 align:start position:0%
hampshire since becoming involved since
 
00:13:51.269 --> 00:13:51.279 align:start position:0%
because of covet 19
 
00:13:51.279 --> 00:13:52.470 align:start position:0%
because of covet 19
that

00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:52.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:54.720 align:start position:0%
image has been tarnished a little bit
 
00:13:58.069 --> 00:13:58.079 align:start position:0%
um i became actively involved in the
 
00:14:00.069 --> 00:14:00.079 align:start position:0%
this process
 
00:14:04.389 --> 00:14:04.399 align:start position:0%
in the end of 2021 beginning of 2022
 
00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:06.880 align:start position:0%
and i was actually
 
00:14:09.189 --> 00:14:09.199 align:start position:0%
appalled with the way
 
00:14:11.509 --> 00:14:11.519 align:start position:0%
people are being discriminated against
 
00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:14.160 align:start position:0%
because of this pandemic
 
00:14:16.629 --> 00:14:16.639 align:start position:0%
not only in our communities but right
 
00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
here in our legislative body
 
00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:22.160 align:start position:0%
this bill would hold those people
 
00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:25.360 align:start position:0%
responsible and accountable
 
00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
at every level and it needs to be done i
 
00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:33.040 align:start position:0%
was in a senate hearing yesterday and um
 
00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:36.320 align:start position:0%
one of the senators who spoke
 
00:14:37.189 --> 00:14:37.199 align:start position:0%
actually it might have been a
 
00:14:39.509 --> 00:14:39.519 align:start position:0%
representative hearing but he said the
 
00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:41.680 align:start position:0%
bottom line is is that
 
00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:43.600 align:start position:0%
we don't want to approve this because we
 
00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:46.000 align:start position:0%
want everyone vaccinated that's not
 
00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:48.320 align:start position:0%
appropriate that is not appropriate for
 
00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:50.880 align:start position:0%
someone to take that kind of a stand
 
00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
he's representing the people of new
 
00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:54.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire not everyone in new hampshire
 
00:14:56.470 --> 00:14:56.480 align:start position:0%
wants this vaccine not everyone in new
 
00:14:58.550 --> 00:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire believes in this vaccine not
 
00:15:00.310 --> 00:15:00.320 align:start position:0%
everyone in new hampshire trusts our
 
00:15:02.389 --> 00:15:02.399 align:start position:0%
federal government or even our state
 
00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:03.920 align:start position:0%
government at this point
 
00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:06.720 align:start position:0%
i'm here today to support this bill
 
00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:08.240 align:start position:0%
it's a good start
 
00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:11.680 align:start position:0%
i'm not a proponent for more laws i like
 
00:15:13.829 --> 00:15:13.839 align:start position:0%
less laws unfortunately i feel it's the
 
00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:16.480 align:start position:0%
responsibility of this legislative body
 
00:15:19.189 --> 00:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
to rise up against a tyrannical
 
00:15:21.910 --> 00:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
government that's at the federal level
 
00:15:24.629 --> 00:15:24.639 align:start position:0%
and i feel that it's not a partisan
 
00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:27.920 align:start position:0%
issue it is actually a state issue and
 
00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
it's for the people of new hampshire
 
00:15:31.749 --> 00:15:31.759 align:start position:0%
and i hope you folks have the courage to
 
00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:33.680 align:start position:0%
support this bill thank you and i'll
 
00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:38.560 align:start position:0%

00:26:52.630 --> 00:26:52.640 align:start position:0%
on consent this time we'll now close the
 
00:26:55.110 --> 00:26:55.120 align:start position:0%
executive session on house bill
 
00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:59.029 align:start position:0%
executive session on house bill
1027

00:26:59.029 --> 00:26:59.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:04.630 --> 00:27:04.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:59.830 --> 00:27:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:04.870 --> 00:28:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:06.070 --> 00:28:06.080 align:start position:0%
no but the
 
00:28:07.830 --> 00:28:07.840 align:start position:0%
the microphones are live
 
00:28:10.630 --> 00:28:10.640 align:start position:0%
okay um i'm wondering if we can exact
 
00:28:13.830 --> 00:28:13.840 align:start position:0%
any bills that are not on today's docket
 
00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:22.789 --> 00:28:22.799 align:start position:0%
we were discussing the
 
00:28:25.430 --> 00:28:25.440 align:start position:0%
hb 1600
 
00:28:26.710 --> 00:28:26.720 align:start position:0%
and i think that's what we're going to
 
00:28:29.110 --> 00:28:29.120 align:start position:0%
move with open right now
 
00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:31.760 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering because
 
00:28:35.269 --> 00:28:35.279 align:start position:0%
usually this is on a right to know that
 
00:28:38.310 --> 00:28:38.320 align:start position:0%
it's not on the calendar for today so
 
00:28:42.149 --> 00:28:42.159 align:start position:0%
any bills that not on the calendar
 
00:28:46.789 --> 00:28:46.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:48.549 --> 00:28:48.559 align:start position:0%
actually when the when everything's
 
00:28:49.909 --> 00:28:49.919 align:start position:0%
noticed it's
 
00:28:49.919 --> 00:28:51.110 align:start position:0%
noticed it's
in

00:28:51.110 --> 00:28:51.120 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:28:52.950 --> 00:28:52.960 align:start position:0%
i'll just read the notice
 
00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:54.149 align:start position:0%
i'll just read the notice
executive

00:28:54.149 --> 00:28:54.159 align:start position:0%

it's preferred the microphone is on
 
00:29:29.510 --> 00:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
yeah i just in your explanation i just
 
00:29:31.350 --> 00:29:31.360 align:start position:0%
wanted to understand it so i understand
 
00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:32.470 align:start position:0%
wanted to understand it so i understand
process

00:29:32.470 --> 00:29:32.480 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:29:35.029 --> 00:29:35.039 align:start position:0%
it would be pending that would include
 
00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
all previous bills that have not been
 
00:29:41.430 --> 00:29:41.440 align:start position:0%
have a final vote have not been exact is
 
00:29:46.389 --> 00:29:46.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:48.470 --> 00:29:48.480 align:start position:0%
can you can you rephrase that i kind of
 
00:29:51.510 --> 00:29:51.520 align:start position:0%
yeah i there is a notice on the on the
 
00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:52.710 align:start position:0%
yeah i there is a notice on the on the
sheet

00:29:52.710 --> 00:29:52.720 align:start position:0%
sheet
 
00:29:55.669 --> 00:29:55.679 align:start position:0%
and it mentions pending legislation and
 
00:29:58.310 --> 00:29:58.320 align:start position:0%
i'm just curious as to
 
00:30:00.630 --> 00:30:00.640 align:start position:0%
that word i believe is the word that
 
00:30:03.350 --> 00:30:03.360 align:start position:0%
makes it able to be exact because it
 
00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:06.320 align:start position:0%
includes all legislation that we have
 
00:30:08.710 --> 00:30:08.720 align:start position:0%
heard and have not
 
00:30:11.990 --> 00:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
exact on is that correct
 
00:30:14.149 --> 00:30:14.159 align:start position:0%
yes that and this is exactly how we did
 
00:30:16.070 --> 00:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
it last year as well
 
00:30:18.230 --> 00:30:18.240 align:start position:0%
at this at this time we will now open
 
00:30:21.990 --> 00:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
the executive session on house bill
 
00:30:26.389 --> 00:30:26.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:27.909 --> 00:30:27.919 align:start position:0%

hp 1600
 
00:30:54.149 --> 00:30:54.159 align:start position:0%
is relative to
 
00:30:56.470 --> 00:30:56.480 align:start position:0%
mandatory body cams during custodial
 
00:30:58.710 --> 00:30:58.720 align:start position:0%
interrogation it conflicts with another
 
00:31:00.630 --> 00:31:00.640 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation
 
00:31:02.789 --> 00:31:02.799 align:start position:0%
that um speaks to custodial
 
00:31:05.029 --> 00:31:05.039 align:start position:0%
interrogation is currently before us
 
00:31:06.789 --> 00:31:06.799 align:start position:0%
also it
 
00:31:09.110 --> 00:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
quite possibly is an unfunded mandate
 
00:31:20.630 --> 00:31:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:21.990 --> 00:31:22.000 align:start position:0%

00:32:45.750 --> 00:32:45.760 align:start position:0%
by a vote of 17
 
00:32:46.789 --> 00:32:46.799 align:start position:0%
days and
 
00:32:48.950 --> 00:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
three nays
 
00:32:50.630 --> 00:32:50.640 align:start position:0%
the motion passes
 
00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
representative hearn
 
00:32:53.590 --> 00:32:53.600 align:start position:0%
i have a question for the chair is there
 
00:32:55.590 --> 00:32:55.600 align:start position:0%
going to be the practice today that we
 
00:32:57.350 --> 00:32:57.360 align:start position:0%
activate our
 
00:33:00.149 --> 00:33:00.159 align:start position:0%
mics when we're voting also
 
00:33:02.149 --> 00:33:02.159 align:start position:0%
it is prefer it is preferred that if you
 
00:33:04.389 --> 00:33:04.399 align:start position:0%
are speaking whether you're voting
 
00:33:05.830 --> 00:33:05.840 align:start position:0%
or just recognized to speak that you
 
00:33:07.350 --> 00:33:07.360 align:start position:0%
turn your microphone on and then
 
00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
immediately thereafter turn it off i i
 
00:33:12.470 --> 00:33:12.480 align:start position:0%
guess for ryan said only
 
00:33:14.470 --> 00:33:14.480 align:start position:0%
four microphones can be on at a time
 
00:33:16.230 --> 00:33:16.240 align:start position:0%
when the red light's on but when your
 
00:33:18.149 --> 00:33:18.159 align:start position:0%
microphone is off
 
00:33:20.950 --> 00:33:20.960 align:start position:0%
the there's a speaker that will actually
 
00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
allow audio for you to hear the
 
00:33:24.950 --> 00:33:24.960 align:start position:0%
microphone as well also
 
00:33:26.870 --> 00:33:26.880 align:start position:0%
and i received this criticism a lot that
 
00:33:28.710 --> 00:33:28.720 align:start position:0%
when the microphone's on the papers
 
00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:38.470 align:start position:0%
 
it

00:33:38.470 --> 00:33:38.480 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:33:39.990 --> 00:33:40.000 align:start position:0%
it's very distracting
 
00:33:41.830 --> 00:33:41.840 align:start position:0%
so if anyone sees them might go on i can
 
00:33:43.190 --> 00:33:43.200 align:start position:0%
turn them all off it also turns off the
 
00:33:46.870 --> 00:33:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:48.230 --> 00:33:48.240 align:start position:0%
can we
 
00:33:51.110 --> 00:33:51.120 align:start position:0%
if seconded by representative marston
 
00:34:01.110 --> 00:34:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:19.109 --> 00:34:19.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:22.950 --> 00:34:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:27.669 --> 00:34:27.679 align:start position:0%
object objection noted not unconsent
 
00:34:29.510 --> 00:34:29.520 align:start position:0%

00:34:31.510 --> 00:34:31.520 align:start position:0%

uh the sponsor of the bill i know
 
00:46:28.150 --> 00:46:28.160 align:start position:0%
couldn't be here today
 
00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:29.109 align:start position:0%
couldn't be here today
and

00:46:29.109 --> 00:46:29.119 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:46:31.510 --> 00:46:31.520 align:start position:0%
he's actually traveling so
 
00:46:34.710 --> 00:46:34.720 align:start position:0%
but in speaking with the sponsor
 
00:46:36.630 --> 00:46:36.640 align:start position:0%
in discussion this bill with it's his
 
00:46:37.829 --> 00:46:37.839 align:start position:0%
understanding that
 
00:46:39.990 --> 00:46:40.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of the intent of this bill is
 
00:46:42.230 --> 00:46:42.240 align:start position:0%
actually already existing law and
 
00:46:43.750 --> 00:46:43.760 align:start position:0%
therefore i mean there's no process for
 
00:46:44.870 --> 00:46:44.880 align:start position:0%
him to
 
00:46:47.349 --> 00:46:47.359 align:start position:0%
withdraw it but he
 
00:46:49.030 --> 00:46:49.040 align:start position:0%
is withdrawing his support for or the
 
00:46:51.109 --> 00:46:51.119 align:start position:0%
need for the bill
 
00:46:53.990 --> 00:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
so i'm introducing it in supporting it
 
00:46:55.510 --> 00:46:55.520 align:start position:0%
simply to introduce it but i would
 
00:46:57.510 --> 00:46:57.520 align:start position:0%

i'd like to move in expedient to

00:53:21.829 --> 00:53:21.839 align:start position:0%
during public testimony on this bill
 
00:53:24.230 --> 00:53:24.240 align:start position:0%
we heard from both the state police and
 
00:53:27.109 --> 00:53:27.119 align:start position:0%
the bill sponsors
 
00:53:29.030 --> 00:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
the state police
 
00:53:31.910 --> 00:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
while they admit the capability
 
00:53:33.510 --> 00:53:33.520 align:start position:0%
is there
 
00:53:33.520 --> 00:53:34.630 align:start position:0%
is there
they

00:53:34.630 --> 00:53:34.640 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:53:37.190 --> 00:53:37.200 align:start position:0%
were reticent to put that onus
 
00:53:39.430 --> 00:53:39.440 align:start position:0%
on the officers to determine a person's
 
00:53:39.440 --> 00:53:40.630 align:start position:0%
on the officers to determine a person's
race

00:53:40.630 --> 00:53:40.640 align:start position:0%
race
 
00:53:43.270 --> 00:53:43.280 align:start position:0%
and they also including the sponsor
 
00:53:44.630 --> 00:53:44.640 align:start position:0%
agreed that it would put the police in
 
00:53:46.470 --> 00:53:46.480 align:start position:0%
an awkward position to have to inquire
 
00:53:48.230 --> 00:53:48.240 align:start position:0%
as to race
 
00:53:51.430 --> 00:53:51.440 align:start position:0%
and we the sponsor included agreed that
 
00:53:53.750 --> 00:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
the proper solution would be to
 
00:53:55.990 --> 00:53:56.000 align:start position:0%
make it available on the driver's
 
00:53:58.309 --> 00:53:58.319 align:start position:0%
license for someone to self-identify
 
00:54:01.670 --> 00:54:01.680 align:start position:0%
their race should they be so inclined
 
00:54:03.190 --> 00:54:03.200 align:start position:0%
that would further the purpose of the
 
00:54:05.990 --> 00:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
bill by getting accurate information
 
00:54:07.190 --> 00:54:07.200 align:start position:0%
on which
 
00:54:08.829 --> 00:54:08.839 align:start position:0%
to base future
 
00:54:11.990 --> 00:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
legislation at best having an officer
 
00:54:14.470 --> 00:54:14.480 align:start position:0%
guess as to the race
 
00:54:16.309 --> 00:54:16.319 align:start position:0%
of someone they pull over is going to
 
00:54:17.510 --> 00:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
lead to
 
00:54:19.990 --> 00:54:20.000 align:start position:0%
inaccurate information
 
00:54:23.109 --> 00:54:23.119 align:start position:0%
and possibly complications
 
00:54:25.589 --> 00:54:25.599 align:start position:0%
and confrontations that are unnecessary
 
00:54:27.430 --> 00:54:27.440 align:start position:0%
on the roadside
 
00:54:35.510 --> 00:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:41.190 --> 00:54:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:42.549 --> 00:54:42.559 align:start position:0%
we're now discussing the bill is that
 
00:54:42.559 --> 00:54:43.589 align:start position:0%
we're now discussing the bill is that
correct

00:54:43.589 --> 00:54:43.599 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:54:45.270 --> 00:54:45.280 align:start position:0%
we're in executive session discussing
 
00:54:47.990 --> 00:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
the bill i want to make sure yes
 
00:54:49.430 --> 00:54:49.440 align:start position:0%
open questions
 
00:54:53.030 --> 00:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
in expedition to legislate thank you
 
00:54:55.349 --> 00:54:55.359 align:start position:0%
although everything that the vice chair
 
00:54:58.789 --> 00:54:58.799 align:start position:0%
said is absolutely true
 
00:55:00.630 --> 00:55:00.640 align:start position:0%
i believe it's not the best solution
 
00:55:02.630 --> 00:55:02.640 align:start position:0%
because we don't have it on the driver's
 
00:55:04.549 --> 00:55:04.559 align:start position:0%
license now
 
00:55:08.150 --> 00:55:08.160 align:start position:0%
i think we heard in the testimony
 
00:55:08.160 --> 00:55:09.270 align:start position:0%
i think we heard in the testimony
that

00:55:09.270 --> 00:55:09.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:55:11.190 --> 00:55:11.200 align:start position:0%
a lot of this information
 
00:55:15.670 --> 00:55:15.680 align:start position:0%
about race and ethnicity is currently
 
00:55:18.870 --> 00:55:18.880 align:start position:0%
required to be reported
 
00:55:21.109 --> 00:55:21.119 align:start position:0%
and the officers don't really guess that
 
00:55:23.829 --> 00:55:23.839 align:start position:0%
uh in the briefing that we that i
 
00:55:27.670 --> 00:55:27.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:31.270 --> 00:55:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:33.829 --> 00:55:33.839 align:start position:0%
they do have to report it and they they
 
00:55:35.030 --> 00:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
don't guess
 
00:55:37.510 --> 00:55:37.520 align:start position:0%
and they don't make a judgment
 
00:55:39.109 --> 00:55:39.119 align:start position:0%
they ask the person
 
00:55:41.030 --> 00:55:41.040 align:start position:0%
that has been arrested what their race
 
00:55:43.430 --> 00:55:43.440 align:start position:0%
in ethnicity is
 
00:55:45.190 --> 00:55:45.200 align:start position:0%
they're reported in a system that has
 
00:55:47.109 --> 00:55:47.119 align:start position:0%
drop down menus
 
00:55:50.150 --> 00:55:50.160 align:start position:0%
and i asked when the testimony was given
 
00:55:51.990 --> 00:55:52.000 align:start position:0%
that we'd be given a copy of the drop
 
00:55:54.069 --> 00:55:54.079 align:start position:0%
down menus in order that
 
00:55:55.990 --> 00:55:56.000 align:start position:0%
people could see and understand what is
 
00:55:57.990 --> 00:55:58.000 align:start position:0%
available how it's reported and whether
 
00:55:59.750 --> 00:55:59.760 align:start position:0%
it should be actually part of this
 
00:55:59.760 --> 00:56:02.150 align:start position:0%
it should be actually part of this
report

00:56:02.150 --> 00:56:02.160 align:start position:0%
report
 
00:56:04.710 --> 00:56:04.720 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:56:07.109 --> 00:56:07.119 align:start position:0%
i think that since that information is
 
00:56:09.430 --> 00:56:09.440 align:start position:0%
already reported people don't guess
 
00:56:11.750 --> 00:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
people actually do what they said they
 
00:56:13.829 --> 00:56:13.839 align:start position:0%
did in that briefing
 
00:56:13.839 --> 00:56:15.030 align:start position:0%
did in that briefing
that

00:56:15.030 --> 00:56:15.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:56:17.670 --> 00:56:17.680 align:start position:0%
in for transparency since that
 
00:56:19.670 --> 00:56:19.680 align:start position:0%
information is available it could be
 
00:56:21.670 --> 00:56:21.680 align:start position:0%
included in the report that is required
 
00:56:22.710 --> 00:56:22.720 align:start position:0%
by this
 
00:56:22.720 --> 00:56:24.230 align:start position:0%
by this
bill

00:56:24.230 --> 00:56:24.240 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:56:26.150 --> 00:56:26.160 align:start position:0%
and so for that reason i will not
 
00:56:28.390 --> 00:56:28.400 align:start position:0%
support the itl motion thank you mr
 
00:56:28.400 --> 00:56:33.190 align:start position:0%
support the itl motion thank you mr
chair

00:56:33.190 --> 00:56:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:34.710 --> 00:56:34.720 align:start position:0%
representative conley
 
00:56:36.470 --> 00:56:36.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i would add uh
 
00:56:38.630 --> 00:56:38.640 align:start position:0%
briefly that while i also agree with
 
00:56:42.630 --> 00:56:42.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:44.309 --> 00:56:44.319 align:start position:0%
there is a solution to that which we
 
00:56:45.510 --> 00:56:45.520 align:start position:0%
just heard
 
00:56:47.990 --> 00:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
that we now cannot pursue because the
 
00:56:50.390 --> 00:56:50.400 align:start position:0%
bill is intended for itl so
 
00:56:52.549 --> 00:56:52.559 align:start position:0%
uh given that we have identified a
 
00:56:54.870 --> 00:56:54.880 align:start position:0%
solution would it not be better to
 
00:56:56.950 --> 00:56:56.960 align:start position:0%
shelve this motion come back with an
 
00:56:59.030 --> 00:56:59.040 align:start position:0%
amendment to put this information on the
 
00:56:59.040 --> 00:57:00.549 align:start position:0%
amendment to put this information on the
license

00:57:00.549 --> 00:57:00.559 align:start position:0%
license
 
00:57:09.270 --> 00:57:09.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:11.270 --> 00:57:11.280 align:start position:0%
if i may understand are you
 
00:57:13.270 --> 00:57:13.280 align:start position:0%
the representative are you suggesting
 
00:57:15.829 --> 00:57:15.839 align:start position:0%
that you would support an amendment put
 
00:57:17.349 --> 00:57:17.359 align:start position:0%
putting an individual's race on a
 
00:57:21.510 --> 00:57:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:22.710 --> 00:57:22.720 align:start position:0%
mr chairman
 
00:57:24.470 --> 00:57:24.480 align:start position:0%
this question has come before the
 
00:57:24.480 --> 00:57:25.670 align:start position:0%
this question has come before the
committee

00:57:25.670 --> 00:57:25.680 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:57:28.150 --> 00:57:28.160 align:start position:0%
many times over the years twice that i
 
00:57:29.750 --> 00:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
can think of in the last two and we
 
00:57:32.150 --> 00:57:32.160 align:start position:0%
cannot seem to find a way to get this
 
00:57:35.750 --> 00:57:35.760 align:start position:0%
data and if that is the only hurdle to
 
00:57:37.589 --> 00:57:37.599 align:start position:0%
allowing our state agencies to collect
 
00:57:39.270 --> 00:57:39.280 align:start position:0%
this data then no i would have no
 
00:57:45.589 --> 00:57:45.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:45.599 --> 00:57:48.230 align:start position:0%
 
well

00:57:48.230 --> 00:57:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:49.990 --> 00:57:50.000 align:start position:0%
i'm just trying to i'm going to let
 
00:57:51.990 --> 00:57:52.000 align:start position:0%
everyone continue to speak and
 
00:57:57.750 --> 00:57:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:01.349 --> 00:58:01.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:03.829 --> 00:58:03.839 align:start position:0%
data on what we need
 
00:58:06.309 --> 00:58:06.319 align:start position:0%
but i'm trying to understand
 
00:58:09.990 --> 00:58:10.000 align:start position:0%
why we need this data and what we're
 
00:58:11.510 --> 00:58:11.520 align:start position:0%
going to do with it
 
00:58:13.990 --> 00:58:14.000 align:start position:0%
because if we're just going to collect
 
00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:14.710 align:start position:0%
because if we're just going to collect
it

00:58:14.710 --> 00:58:14.720 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:58:17.430 --> 00:58:17.440 align:start position:0%
and not use it i see no purpose in
 
00:58:19.990 --> 00:58:20.000 align:start position:0%
collecting it
 
00:58:21.910 --> 00:58:21.920 align:start position:0%
does anybody have a reason for
 
00:58:28.630 --> 00:58:28.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:31.270 --> 00:58:31.280 align:start position:0%
representative newman wished to respond
 
00:58:33.750 --> 00:58:33.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to respond
 
00:58:35.190 --> 00:58:35.200 align:start position:0%
for some reason
 
00:58:36.870 --> 00:58:36.880 align:start position:0%
the state police collects that
 
00:58:39.109 --> 00:58:39.119 align:start position:0%
information i have not had time to
 
00:58:41.589 --> 00:58:41.599 align:start position:0%
research the law to find out why but the
 
00:58:43.589 --> 00:58:43.599 align:start position:0%
court system requires that that
 
00:58:45.589 --> 00:58:45.599 align:start position:0%
information or some
 
00:58:47.510 --> 00:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
some entity in the government requires
 
00:58:49.349 --> 00:58:49.359 align:start position:0%
that information i don't know what they
 
00:58:50.710 --> 00:58:50.720 align:start position:0%
use it for
 
00:58:52.630 --> 00:58:52.640 align:start position:0%
but since it's available
 
00:58:55.349 --> 00:58:55.359 align:start position:0%
it would be also something that you they
 
00:58:57.589 --> 00:58:57.599 align:start position:0%
could reference when they get the
 
00:58:59.750 --> 00:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity to make further reports that
 
00:59:02.309 --> 00:59:02.319 align:start position:0%
we've seen before this committee before
 
00:59:04.470 --> 00:59:04.480 align:start position:0%
so that they could accurately
 
00:59:06.390 --> 00:59:06.400 align:start position:0%
put that information in any report
 
00:59:06.400 --> 00:59:08.069 align:start position:0%
put that information in any report
that's

00:59:08.069 --> 00:59:08.079 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:59:09.910 --> 00:59:09.920 align:start position:0%
required in the future
 
00:59:12.309 --> 00:59:12.319 align:start position:0%
and it would be just as accurate as it
 
00:59:19.109 --> 00:59:19.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:21.670 --> 00:59:21.680 align:start position:0%
representative roy
 
00:59:23.589 --> 00:59:23.599 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:59:26.710 --> 00:59:26.720 align:start position:0%
i agree with representative
 
00:59:30.870 --> 00:59:30.880 align:start position:0%
newman that the information is collected
 
00:59:30.880 --> 00:59:31.750 align:start position:0%
newman that the information is collected
but

00:59:31.750 --> 00:59:31.760 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:59:33.430 --> 00:59:33.440 align:start position:0%
there's a distinction it's currently
 
00:59:33.440 --> 00:59:34.470 align:start position:0%
there's a distinction it's currently
collected

00:59:34.470 --> 00:59:34.480 align:start position:0%
collected
 
00:59:36.069 --> 00:59:36.079 align:start position:0%
during arrest
 
00:59:37.910 --> 00:59:37.920 align:start position:0%
as part of the booking procedure and
 
00:59:40.710 --> 00:59:40.720 align:start position:0%
that information is required by the fbi
 
00:59:42.390 --> 00:59:42.400 align:start position:0%
and they use it to compile various
 
00:59:44.470 --> 00:59:44.480 align:start position:0%
statistics and and things of this nature
 
00:59:46.710 --> 00:59:46.720 align:start position:0%
that they put out every year with crime
 
00:59:46.720 --> 00:59:48.069 align:start position:0%
that they put out every year with crime
statistics

00:59:48.069 --> 00:59:48.079 align:start position:0%
statistics
 
00:59:50.150 --> 00:59:50.160 align:start position:0%
i think there is value in capturing the
 
00:59:52.309 --> 00:59:52.319 align:start position:0%
race as well as other
 
00:59:52.319 --> 00:59:53.990 align:start position:0%
race as well as other
biographical

00:59:53.990 --> 00:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
biographical
 
00:59:56.150 --> 00:59:56.160 align:start position:0%
information on the people
 
00:59:58.710 --> 00:59:58.720 align:start position:0%
but we have to do it in a proper manner
 
01:00:00.630 --> 01:00:00.640 align:start position:0%
and what if we do it
 
01:00:03.349 --> 01:00:03.359 align:start position:0%
roadside versus as it's already done
 
01:00:04.710 --> 01:00:04.720 align:start position:0%
during arrest
 
01:00:07.589 --> 01:00:07.599 align:start position:0%
it can lead to problems for example
 
01:00:10.150 --> 01:00:10.160 align:start position:0%
as part of the citation
 
01:00:12.150 --> 01:00:12.160 align:start position:0%
the officer says
 
01:00:14.150 --> 01:00:14.160 align:start position:0%
could you please identify your race well
 
01:00:16.470 --> 01:00:16.480 align:start position:0%
i'm african-american okay here's your
 
01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:17.510 align:start position:0%
i'm african-american okay here's your
ticket

01:00:17.510 --> 01:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
ticket
 
01:00:18.950 --> 01:00:18.960 align:start position:0%
it's going to lead to confrontations
 
01:00:20.630 --> 01:00:20.640 align:start position:0%
that are unnecessary
 
01:00:23.430 --> 01:00:23.440 align:start position:0%
i also agree with representative conley
 
01:00:26.390 --> 01:00:26.400 align:start position:0%
that we should in fact have a bill that
 
01:00:28.950 --> 01:00:28.960 align:start position:0%
enables people not mandates enables
 
01:00:30.870 --> 01:00:30.880 align:start position:0%
people to self-identify their race on
 
01:00:32.470 --> 01:00:32.480 align:start position:0%
the driver's license
 
01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:33.910 align:start position:0%
the driver's license
however

01:00:33.910 --> 01:00:33.920 align:start position:0%
however
 
01:00:36.069 --> 01:00:36.079 align:start position:0%
such a bill would not be in this
 
01:00:36.079 --> 01:00:37.030 align:start position:0%
such a bill would not be in this
committee

01:00:37.030 --> 01:00:37.040 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:00:38.950 --> 01:00:38.960 align:start position:0%
it would go to transportation it would
 
01:00:40.470 --> 01:00:40.480 align:start position:0%
require a new bill
 
01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:41.510 align:start position:0%
require a new bill
um

01:00:41.510 --> 01:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:42.470 align:start position:0%
um
so

01:00:42.470 --> 01:00:42.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:00:44.069 --> 01:00:44.079 align:start position:0%
i think the best thing to do is do it
 
01:00:46.470 --> 01:00:46.480 align:start position:0%
right start from scratch
 
01:00:48.309 --> 01:00:48.319 align:start position:0%
but i do agree that there is value in
 
01:00:50.390 --> 01:00:50.400 align:start position:0%
capturing the information so for that
 
01:00:51.910 --> 01:00:51.920 align:start position:0%
reason i'm going to stay with my
 
01:00:59.910 --> 01:00:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:02.309 --> 01:01:02.319 align:start position:0%
represent newman you wish to
 
01:01:02.319 --> 01:01:03.990 align:start position:0%
represent newman you wish to
speak

01:01:03.990 --> 01:01:04.000 align:start position:0%
speak
 
01:01:05.510 --> 01:01:05.520 align:start position:0%
thank you and um
 
01:01:08.150 --> 01:01:08.160 align:start position:0%
i i agree with that and and the
 
01:01:09.910 --> 01:01:09.920 align:start position:0%
officers that gave the briefing that we
 
01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:11.270 align:start position:0%
officers that gave the briefing that we
saw

01:01:11.270 --> 01:01:11.280 align:start position:0%
saw
 
01:01:13.030 --> 01:01:13.040 align:start position:0%
went to great lengths that they did not
 
01:01:14.549 --> 01:01:14.559 align:start position:0%
want to
 
01:01:16.230 --> 01:01:16.240 align:start position:0%
get the information
 
01:01:17.829 --> 01:01:17.839 align:start position:0%
on roadside
 
01:01:20.630 --> 01:01:20.640 align:start position:0%
and i agree with that 100 percent
 
01:01:23.510 --> 01:01:23.520 align:start position:0%
where i disagree with that is
 
01:01:25.829 --> 01:01:25.839 align:start position:0%
we get that information
 
01:01:27.750 --> 01:01:27.760 align:start position:0%
i don't know what the dr what
 
01:01:29.190 --> 01:01:29.200 align:start position:0%
improvements could be made to the drop
 
01:01:31.349 --> 01:01:31.359 align:start position:0%
down menu that they use now but maybe in
 
01:01:32.789 --> 01:01:32.799 align:start position:0%
result of
 
01:01:35.430 --> 01:01:35.440 align:start position:0%
legislation like this they might redo
 
01:01:38.309 --> 01:01:38.319 align:start position:0%
their menus but for right now they do it
 
01:01:40.630 --> 01:01:40.640 align:start position:0%
with arrests and it is accurate enough
 
01:01:41.589 --> 01:01:41.599 align:start position:0%
for the
 
01:01:41.599 --> 01:01:42.789 align:start position:0%
for the
fbi

01:01:42.789 --> 01:01:42.799 align:start position:0%
fbi
 
01:01:45.270 --> 01:01:45.280 align:start position:0%
and all i'm pro all i'm saying is that
 
01:01:48.069 --> 01:01:48.079 align:start position:0%
is wrong by itlling this bill
 
01:01:50.309 --> 01:01:50.319 align:start position:0%
is that we have a place where they get
 
01:01:52.549 --> 01:01:52.559 align:start position:0%
information the information is correct
 
01:01:55.430 --> 01:01:55.440 align:start position:0%
is is collected
 
01:01:57.589 --> 01:01:57.599 align:start position:0%
and sent to the fbi so we have that
 
01:01:59.750 --> 01:01:59.760 align:start position:0%
information available that is
 
01:02:02.390 --> 01:02:02.400 align:start position:0%
suitable for the fbi needs
 
01:02:04.150 --> 01:02:04.160 align:start position:0%
and i just believe if we have that
 
01:02:06.309 --> 01:02:06.319 align:start position:0%
information there's no reason why we
 
01:02:06.319 --> 01:02:07.349 align:start position:0%
information there's no reason why we
could

01:02:07.349 --> 01:02:07.359 align:start position:0%
could
 
01:02:09.510 --> 01:02:09.520 align:start position:0%
could not use it if we had if we were
 
01:02:12.069 --> 01:02:12.079 align:start position:0%
going to require a report here like is
 
01:02:14.630 --> 01:02:14.640 align:start position:0%
requested in the bill
 
01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:15.430 align:start position:0%
requested in the bill
and

01:02:15.430 --> 01:02:15.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:02:17.029 --> 01:02:17.039 align:start position:0%
and do it that way i just hate to see
 
01:02:20.150 --> 01:02:20.160 align:start position:0%
that information going to waste because
 
01:02:21.910 --> 01:02:21.920 align:start position:0%
we've just done it over and over year
 
01:02:23.190 --> 01:02:23.200 align:start position:0%
after year and this would be another
 
01:02:29.109 --> 01:02:29.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:29.119 --> 01:02:31.109 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:02:31.109 --> 01:02:31.119 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:02:33.029 --> 01:02:33.039 align:start position:0%
call me thank you mr chairman quickly
 
01:02:34.630 --> 01:02:34.640 align:start position:0%
one final point i'll make as we move
 
01:02:36.470 --> 01:02:36.480 align:start position:0%
toward what appears to be a vote is the
 
01:02:38.870 --> 01:02:38.880 align:start position:0%
trooper who addressed this committee
 
01:02:40.710 --> 01:02:40.720 align:start position:0%
indicated that this data would be
 
01:02:42.950 --> 01:02:42.960 align:start position:0%
extremely useful and go far beyond what
 
01:02:45.430 --> 01:02:45.440 align:start position:0%
the state police already produces
 
01:02:47.349 --> 01:02:47.359 align:start position:0%
so again we have a tool that we could
 
01:02:47.359 --> 01:02:48.470 align:start position:0%
so again we have a tool that we could
use

01:02:48.470 --> 01:02:48.480 align:start position:0%
use
 
01:02:50.630 --> 01:02:50.640 align:start position:0%
by getting by using that tool and
 
01:02:52.309 --> 01:02:52.319 align:start position:0%
putting it on the license transportation
 
01:02:53.829 --> 01:02:53.839 align:start position:0%
would have the ability to review this
 
01:02:53.839 --> 01:02:54.789 align:start position:0%
would have the ability to review this
bill

01:02:54.789 --> 01:02:54.799 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:02:56.470 --> 01:02:56.480 align:start position:0%
as a second committee there's ample time
 
01:02:57.589 --> 01:02:57.599 align:start position:0%
in the session
 
01:02:57.599 --> 01:02:59.270 align:start position:0%
in the session
so

01:02:59.270 --> 01:02:59.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:03:01.190 --> 01:03:01.200 align:start position:0%
rather than wait another year
 
01:03:03.270 --> 01:03:03.280 align:start position:0%
i would ask that we maybe take action
 
01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:04.150 align:start position:0%
i would ask that we maybe take action
now

01:03:04.150 --> 01:03:04.160 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:03:06.150 --> 01:03:06.160 align:start position:0%
and we have that uh opportunity thank
 
01:03:06.160 --> 01:03:09.190 align:start position:0%
and we have that uh opportunity thank
you

01:03:09.190 --> 01:03:09.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:11.109 --> 01:03:11.119 align:start position:0%
if i if i miss my inquiry and this is
 
01:03:13.349 --> 01:03:13.359 align:start position:0%
just a this is an open question
 
01:03:15.430 --> 01:03:15.440 align:start position:0%
if this report is made by the state
 
01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:16.630 align:start position:0%
if this report is made by the state
police

01:03:16.630 --> 01:03:16.640 align:start position:0%
police
 
01:03:19.029 --> 01:03:19.039 align:start position:0%
what what is the next step with once you
 
01:03:28.309 --> 01:03:28.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:31.270 --> 01:03:31.280 align:start position:0%
mr chairman the challenge that we have
 
01:03:33.430 --> 01:03:33.440 align:start position:0%
tried to address and i think
 
01:03:35.670 --> 01:03:35.680 align:start position:0%
members of both parties in good faith is
 
01:03:37.510 --> 01:03:37.520 align:start position:0%
getting a better sense
 
01:03:39.829 --> 01:03:39.839 align:start position:0%
of the demographic data
 
01:03:41.589 --> 01:03:41.599 align:start position:0%
of people who have interactions with
 
01:03:41.599 --> 01:03:42.870 align:start position:0%
of people who have interactions with
police

01:03:42.870 --> 01:03:42.880 align:start position:0%
police
 
01:03:45.109 --> 01:03:45.119 align:start position:0%
that struggle that we've repeatedly come
 
01:03:48.069 --> 01:03:48.079 align:start position:0%
up against is the inability to
 
01:03:49.670 --> 01:03:49.680 align:start position:0%
gather that data
 
01:03:51.670 --> 01:03:51.680 align:start position:0%
because we keep encountering this
 
01:03:52.950 --> 01:03:52.960 align:start position:0%
question of
 
01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:53.829 align:start position:0%
question of
uh

01:03:53.829 --> 01:03:53.839 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:03:56.470 --> 01:03:56.480 align:start position:0%
the inability to put police
 
01:03:58.870 --> 01:03:58.880 align:start position:0%
in the position or the the concern of
 
01:04:01.109 --> 01:04:01.119 align:start position:0%
putting police in the position of making
 
01:04:01.119 --> 01:04:02.309 align:start position:0%
putting police in the position of making
guesses

01:04:02.309 --> 01:04:02.319 align:start position:0%
guesses
 
01:04:04.710 --> 01:04:04.720 align:start position:0%
and that's a valid concern
 
01:04:06.150 --> 01:04:06.160 align:start position:0%
but the point i'm trying to make is we
 
01:04:07.829 --> 01:04:07.839 align:start position:0%
have a way
 
01:04:10.390 --> 01:04:10.400 align:start position:0%
of uh of having an official document
 
01:04:12.789 --> 01:04:12.799 align:start position:0%
that would contain this data how that
 
01:04:15.589 --> 01:04:15.599 align:start position:0%
data is then used is unanswerable at the
 
01:04:17.670 --> 01:04:17.680 align:start position:0%
moment but it provides information that
 
01:04:19.510 --> 01:04:19.520 align:start position:0%
we don't currently have and members of
 
01:04:25.589 --> 01:04:25.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:27.829 --> 01:04:27.839 align:start position:0%
so if there's a an interest to gather
 
01:04:30.069 --> 01:04:30.079 align:start position:0%
data to
 
01:04:30.079 --> 01:04:31.910 align:start position:0%
data to
investigate

01:04:31.910 --> 01:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
investigate
 
01:04:33.750 --> 01:04:33.760 align:start position:0%
with different different races and what
 
01:04:35.349 --> 01:04:35.359 align:start position:0%
how often they have interactions with
 
01:04:37.670 --> 01:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
law enforcement
 
01:04:39.029 --> 01:04:39.039 align:start position:0%
gathering the data
 
01:04:41.270 --> 01:04:41.280 align:start position:0%
is one thing what but what does that
 
01:04:43.109 --> 01:04:43.119 align:start position:0%
actually do to
 
01:04:46.230 --> 01:04:46.240 align:start position:0%
mitigate or prevent racial profiling i'm
 
01:04:47.510 --> 01:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
just saying i i you're trying to
 
01:04:49.589 --> 01:04:49.599 align:start position:0%
identify a problem but to me it's not
 
01:04:52.150 --> 01:04:52.160 align:start position:0%
that shouldn't be a matter of degree
 
01:04:53.910 --> 01:04:53.920 align:start position:0%
because once it's one too many in my
 
01:04:56.789 --> 01:04:56.799 align:start position:0%
mind i think for us
 
01:04:58.950 --> 01:04:58.960 align:start position:0%
we should still be trying to
 
01:05:00.950 --> 01:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
prevent that as much as possible and we
 
01:05:02.789 --> 01:05:02.799 align:start position:0%
would reject that just gathering the
 
01:05:04.950 --> 01:05:04.960 align:start position:0%
data to me just seems to be
 
01:05:06.230 --> 01:05:06.240 align:start position:0%
i mean is there a line i don't think
 
01:05:07.510 --> 01:05:07.520 align:start position:0%
there's a line in the sand that we would
 
01:05:09.109 --> 01:05:09.119 align:start position:0%
draw and say this is this is acceptable
 
01:05:10.870 --> 01:05:10.880 align:start position:0%
this is not i think one one time is
 
01:05:12.870 --> 01:05:12.880 align:start position:0%
unacceptable so what does the data do is
 
01:05:16.870 --> 01:05:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:18.950 --> 01:05:18.960 align:start position:0%
well the data answers
 
01:05:20.870 --> 01:05:20.880 align:start position:0%
the data tells us who is having
 
01:05:23.190 --> 01:05:23.200 align:start position:0%
interactions with police and what i
 
01:05:24.950 --> 01:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
would fully expect
 
01:05:26.950 --> 01:05:26.960 align:start position:0%
given the law enforcement we've
 
01:05:29.190 --> 01:05:29.200 align:start position:0%
encountered in this committee and many
 
01:05:31.190 --> 01:05:31.200 align:start position:0%
many of us know in our community is that
 
01:05:34.069 --> 01:05:34.079 align:start position:0%
there is not a widespread
 
01:05:36.789 --> 01:05:36.799 align:start position:0%
problem in our state but i think we
 
01:05:37.990 --> 01:05:38.000 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
01:05:40.630 --> 01:05:40.640 align:start position:0%
until we get the data and what would be
 
01:05:43.109 --> 01:05:43.119 align:start position:0%
tremendous is to see the data
 
01:05:45.190 --> 01:05:45.200 align:start position:0%
and not see any sort of disparity and to
 
01:05:46.870 --> 01:05:46.880 align:start position:0%
sort of put this issue to bed but how
 
01:05:48.710 --> 01:05:48.720 align:start position:0%
would we know until we have the data
 
01:05:50.950 --> 01:05:50.960 align:start position:0%
it's the circular situation we keep
 
01:05:54.950 --> 01:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:56.789 --> 01:05:56.799 align:start position:0%
i i understand the point but what i'm
 
01:05:58.789 --> 01:05:58.799 align:start position:0%
saying is even if it it the data
 
01:06:01.270 --> 01:06:01.280 align:start position:0%
suggests it's not an over happening or
 
01:06:03.589 --> 01:06:03.599 align:start position:0%
you know overwhelmingly or frequent if
 
01:06:04.950 --> 01:06:04.960 align:start position:0%
it's still happening that we should be
 
01:06:06.470 --> 01:06:06.480 align:start position:0%
identifying trying to prevent it from
 
01:06:06.480 --> 01:06:08.630 align:start position:0%
identifying trying to prevent it from
happening

01:06:08.630 --> 01:06:08.640 align:start position:0%
happening
 
01:06:11.190 --> 01:06:11.200 align:start position:0%
anytime so i guess i guess my point is
 
01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:12.230 align:start position:0%
anytime so i guess i guess my point is
what

01:06:12.230 --> 01:06:12.240 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:06:14.069 --> 01:06:14.079 align:start position:0%
is the data going to change anything
 
01:06:15.670 --> 01:06:15.680 align:start position:0%
that's being done already by law
 
01:06:17.670 --> 01:06:17.680 align:start position:0%
enforcement and i i would say that i
 
01:06:19.510 --> 01:06:19.520 align:start position:0%
would think so
 
01:06:19.520 --> 01:06:21.829 align:start position:0%
would think so
but

01:06:21.829 --> 01:06:21.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:23.510 --> 01:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
i raised my man three times you didn't
 
01:06:24.549 --> 01:06:24.559 align:start position:0%
see me
 
01:06:26.630 --> 01:06:26.640 align:start position:0%
no i represent remember same cathode i
 
01:06:27.990 --> 01:06:28.000 align:start position:0%
always try to encourage healthy
 
01:06:30.230 --> 01:06:30.240 align:start position:0%
conversations i hope my friend from
 
01:06:32.470 --> 01:06:32.480 align:start position:0%
dover here thinks we're having one but
 
01:06:32.480 --> 01:06:33.349 align:start position:0%
dover here thinks we're having one but
i'll

01:06:33.349 --> 01:06:33.359 align:start position:0%
i'll
 
01:06:34.710 --> 01:06:34.720 align:start position:0%
i just looked to this side of the room i
 
01:06:36.470 --> 01:06:36.480 align:start position:0%
apologized it was four hands raised and
 
01:06:37.990 --> 01:06:38.000 align:start position:0%
i do apologize
 
01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:43.510 align:start position:0%
i do apologize
but

01:06:43.510 --> 01:06:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:45.109 --> 01:06:45.119 align:start position:0%
i would gladly defer to the ranking
 
01:06:45.119 --> 01:06:46.870 align:start position:0%
i would gladly defer to the ranking
member

01:06:46.870 --> 01:06:46.880 align:start position:0%
member
 
01:06:48.309 --> 01:06:48.319 align:start position:0%
you but that's the point that i was
 
01:06:50.789 --> 01:06:50.799 align:start position:0%
trying to make
 
01:06:52.470 --> 01:06:52.480 align:start position:0%
represent representative harry katherine
 
01:06:53.990 --> 01:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
you were right i just wanted to add to
 
01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:54.630 align:start position:0%
you were right i just wanted to add to
it

01:06:54.630 --> 01:06:54.640 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:06:55.910 --> 01:06:55.920 align:start position:0%
you asked what's going to happen with
 
01:06:57.270 --> 01:06:57.280 align:start position:0%
that date it might mean that there's
 
01:06:58.710 --> 01:06:58.720 align:start position:0%
more training that's available for
 
01:07:00.390 --> 01:07:00.400 align:start position:0%
policemen you know
 
01:07:03.109 --> 01:07:03.119 align:start position:0%
that's it's up to them how they fix that
 
01:07:05.990 --> 01:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
but when i look at racial profiling
 
01:07:09.029 --> 01:07:09.039 align:start position:0%
which is real and live today
 
01:07:11.349 --> 01:07:11.359 align:start position:0%
and everyone knows that
 
01:07:11.359 --> 01:07:12.230 align:start position:0%
and everyone knows that
so

01:07:12.230 --> 01:07:12.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:07:14.230 --> 01:07:14.240 align:start position:0%
what do the policemen have to do to
 
01:07:15.990 --> 01:07:16.000 align:start position:0%
correct that situation because the data
 
01:07:18.309 --> 01:07:18.319 align:start position:0%
is going to show it and we already have
 
01:07:21.190 --> 01:07:21.200 align:start position:0%
data from them that shows it and i think
 
01:07:23.510 --> 01:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
when we first had this bill i don't have
 
01:07:26.230 --> 01:07:26.240 align:start position:0%
my paperwork with me i literally had a
 
01:07:29.510 --> 01:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
document a document that was printed and
 
01:07:32.150 --> 01:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
it gave the data for different towns in
 
01:07:34.549 --> 01:07:34.559 align:start position:0%
in in terms of racial profiling it was
 
01:07:36.390 --> 01:07:36.400 align:start position:0%
nashua it was portsmouth it was
 
01:07:39.029 --> 01:07:39.039 align:start position:0%
manchester and i think it was amherst it
 
01:07:40.150 --> 01:07:40.160 align:start position:0%
was several
 
01:07:42.950 --> 01:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
so it happens and i do know that it's
 
01:07:45.349 --> 01:07:45.359 align:start position:0%
become an issue a training issue as well
 
01:07:47.349 --> 01:07:47.359 align:start position:0%
and a disciplinary issue
 
01:07:49.270 --> 01:07:49.280 align:start position:0%
so we you know
 
01:07:51.190 --> 01:07:51.200 align:start position:0%
i just think that we need more data
 
01:08:06.710 --> 01:08:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:08.069 --> 01:08:08.079 align:start position:0%
and furthermore i thought the bill was a
 
01:08:09.910 --> 01:08:09.920 align:start position:0%
very good bill except that section there
 
01:08:11.670 --> 01:08:11.680 align:start position:0%
where they said they couldn't they did
 
01:08:11.680 --> 01:08:12.549 align:start position:0%
where they said they couldn't they did
say

01:08:12.549 --> 01:08:12.559 align:start position:0%
say
 
01:08:13.990 --> 01:08:14.000 align:start position:0%
they could not
 
01:08:15.990 --> 01:08:16.000 align:start position:0%
tell if someone was late
 
01:08:17.829 --> 01:08:17.839 align:start position:0%
it was something
 
01:08:19.590 --> 01:08:19.600 align:start position:0%
and that's what i thought needed to be
 
01:08:21.110 --> 01:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
carved out of there because they said
 
01:08:23.590 --> 01:08:23.600 align:start position:0%
they had nothing to do with the number
 
01:08:25.510 --> 01:08:25.520 align:start position:0%
citations paid late that type of
 
01:08:26.950 --> 01:08:26.960 align:start position:0%
information remember that was in the
 
01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:30.550 align:start position:0%
information remember that was in the
bill

01:08:30.550 --> 01:08:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:30.560 --> 01:08:31.349 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:08:31.349 --> 01:08:31.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:08:33.349 --> 01:08:33.359 align:start position:0%
when i visited when we went over to
 
01:08:36.789 --> 01:08:36.799 align:start position:0%
visit okay it was i forget his name i
 
01:08:39.269 --> 01:08:39.279 align:start position:0%
think it was vetter v-e-t-t-e-r i think
 
01:08:40.229 --> 01:08:40.239 align:start position:0%
it was
 
01:08:43.030 --> 01:08:43.040 align:start position:0%
and um when we went over to visit they
 
01:08:46.149 --> 01:08:46.159 align:start position:0%
actually said that or they have
 
01:08:46.159 --> 01:08:47.189 align:start position:0%
actually said that or they have
um

01:08:47.189 --> 01:08:47.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:49.590 --> 01:08:49.600 align:start position:0%
yes race depending on what the situation
 
01:08:52.470 --> 01:08:52.480 align:start position:0%
is okay and he literally sat there and
 
01:08:54.470 --> 01:08:54.480 align:start position:0%
said it does happen
 
01:08:55.990 --> 01:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
they don't want to
 
01:08:58.229 --> 01:08:58.239 align:start position:0%
but given what that circumstance might
 
01:08:59.829 --> 01:08:59.839 align:start position:0%
have been when they stopped that person
 
01:09:01.430 --> 01:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
and maybe they had a feeling that
 
01:09:02.470 --> 01:09:02.480 align:start position:0%
something was
 
01:09:04.070 --> 01:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
not quite right
 
01:09:10.390 --> 01:09:10.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:13.749 --> 01:09:13.759 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:16.470 --> 01:09:16.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i think
 
01:09:18.390 --> 01:09:18.400 align:start position:0%
overall this is a
 
01:09:20.470 --> 01:09:20.480 align:start position:0%
bill presents a solution
 
01:09:23.110 --> 01:09:23.120 align:start position:0%
in search of a problem
 
01:09:27.749 --> 01:09:27.759 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:29.590 --> 01:09:29.600 align:start position:0%
representative klein knight
 
01:09:33.269 --> 01:09:33.279 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um with all due
 
01:09:35.749 --> 01:09:35.759 align:start position:0%
prove respect or whether or not people
 
01:09:38.470 --> 01:09:38.480 align:start position:0%
are being racially profiled
 
01:09:40.470 --> 01:09:40.480 align:start position:0%
the concern is
 
01:09:43.510 --> 01:09:43.520 align:start position:0%
that i hear your concern about
 
01:09:46.630 --> 01:09:46.640 align:start position:0%
having this as a necessary precaution
 
01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:48.470 align:start position:0%
having this as a necessary precaution
with would

01:09:48.470 --> 01:09:48.480 align:start position:0%
with would
 
01:09:50.070 --> 01:09:50.080 align:start position:0%
further the
 
01:09:52.229 --> 01:09:52.239 align:start position:0%
act of racial profiling but that would
 
01:09:57.270 --> 01:09:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:00.550 --> 01:10:00.560 align:start position:0%
i i understand the point i i think
 
01:10:01.910 --> 01:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
the message of the question i was
 
01:10:03.189 --> 01:10:03.199 align:start position:0%
putting out there is i don't believe
 
01:10:05.510 --> 01:10:05.520 align:start position:0%
anyone is saying that racial profiling
 
01:10:09.030 --> 01:10:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:11.030 --> 01:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
but saying it never happens i don't
 
01:10:13.750 --> 01:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
think that that's something anyone's
 
01:10:15.669 --> 01:10:15.679 align:start position:0%
putting out there what i what i'm saying
 
01:10:17.030 --> 01:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
is if
 
01:10:18.870 --> 01:10:18.880 align:start position:0%
having a report telling you how often it
 
01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:19.990 align:start position:0%
having a report telling you how often it
happens

01:10:19.990 --> 01:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
happens
 
01:10:21.750 --> 01:10:21.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't do anything to prevent it from
 
01:10:25.350 --> 01:10:25.360 align:start position:0%
happening and i and i understand
 
01:10:26.709 --> 01:10:26.719 align:start position:0%
where representative harry garfield was
 
01:10:28.709 --> 01:10:28.719 align:start position:0%
saying that the police if if they see a
 
01:10:30.709 --> 01:10:30.719 align:start position:0%
report maybe they would adjust their
 
01:10:32.470 --> 01:10:32.480 align:start position:0%
training to try to identify
 
01:10:33.910 --> 01:10:33.920 align:start position:0%
ways to prevent it from happening that
 
01:10:36.310 --> 01:10:36.320 align:start position:0%
often but i would support
 
01:10:38.550 --> 01:10:38.560 align:start position:0%
that type of additional training whether
 
01:10:40.470 --> 01:10:40.480 align:start position:0%
it's happening often or not
 
01:10:41.910 --> 01:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
the idea is we want to prevent it from
 
01:10:43.430 --> 01:10:43.440 align:start position:0%
happening i don't think the report is
 
01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:44.790 align:start position:0%
happening i don't think the report is
necessary

01:10:44.790 --> 01:10:44.800 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
01:10:46.390 --> 01:10:46.400 align:start position:0%
for us to sit to try to prevent it from
 
01:10:47.590 --> 01:10:47.600 align:start position:0%
happening that's the point that i'm
 
01:10:47.600 --> 01:10:49.830 align:start position:0%
happening that's the point that i'm
making

01:10:49.830 --> 01:10:49.840 align:start position:0%
making
 
01:10:52.590 --> 01:10:52.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:09.430 --> 01:11:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:10.830 --> 01:11:10.840 align:start position:0%
it's been
 
01:11:15.030 --> 01:11:15.040 align:start position:0%
recorded representative o'hearn
 
01:11:16.630 --> 01:11:16.640 align:start position:0%
i guess i have a just a question maybe
 
01:11:18.550 --> 01:11:18.560 align:start position:0%
somebody can answer this this
 
01:11:21.110 --> 01:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
only affects state police
 
01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:22.149 align:start position:0%
only affects state police
so

01:11:22.149 --> 01:11:22.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:11:24.830 --> 01:11:24.840 align:start position:0%
i understand that you know
 
01:11:26.790 --> 01:11:26.800 align:start position:0%
what some of the representatives are
 
01:11:28.950 --> 01:11:28.960 align:start position:0%
looking to to get information but
 
01:11:30.550 --> 01:11:30.560 align:start position:0%
it's going to be limited information is
 
01:11:32.470 --> 01:11:32.480 align:start position:0%
it not just from the state police not
 
01:11:33.910 --> 01:11:33.920 align:start position:0%
for the towns
 
01:11:34.870 --> 01:11:34.880 align:start position:0%
and the
 
01:11:37.750 --> 01:11:37.760 align:start position:0%
other municipalities
 
01:11:39.590 --> 01:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
it it wouldn't be a full picture with
 
01:11:43.270 --> 01:11:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:44.950 --> 01:11:44.960 align:start position:0%
representative bourdain
 
01:11:46.149 --> 01:11:46.159 align:start position:0%
thank you for sharing i think it's a
 
01:11:47.750 --> 01:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
point of order uh
 
01:11:47.760 --> 01:11:48.630 align:start position:0%
point of order uh
uh

01:11:48.630 --> 01:11:48.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:11:50.310 --> 01:11:50.320 align:start position:0%
are you are you making a point of order
 
01:11:51.750 --> 01:11:51.760 align:start position:0%
yes i am
 
01:11:52.870 --> 01:11:52.880 align:start position:0%
you're recognized for your point
 
01:11:55.510 --> 01:11:55.520 align:start position:0%
representative uh klein knight
 
01:11:57.669 --> 01:11:57.679 align:start position:0%
as she was speaking was not speaking to
 
01:12:00.709 --> 01:12:00.719 align:start position:0%
a mic and this is a matter of uh
 
01:12:03.830 --> 01:12:03.840 align:start position:0%
uh an audience greater than in this room
 
01:12:05.910 --> 01:12:05.920 align:start position:0%
and i think they would like to hear what
 
01:12:07.350 --> 01:12:07.360 align:start position:0%
all the reps that are going to be
 
01:12:09.030 --> 01:12:09.040 align:start position:0%
talking uh
 
01:12:11.510 --> 01:12:11.520 align:start position:0%
have to say and without a mike
 
01:12:14.390 --> 01:12:14.400 align:start position:0%
she is silent oh
 
01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:16.870 align:start position:0%
she is silent oh
i

01:12:16.870 --> 01:12:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:19.030 --> 01:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
you're right there is first of all there
 
01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:19.750 align:start position:0%
you're right there is first of all there
is

01:12:19.750 --> 01:12:19.760 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:12:21.750 --> 01:12:21.760 align:start position:0%
no rule that i'm aware of that says you
 
01:12:23.750 --> 01:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
have to turn your microphone on
 
01:12:25.910 --> 01:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
but you should turn your microphone on
 
01:12:27.990 --> 01:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
uh seeing where the representative is
 
01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:29.750 align:start position:0%
uh seeing where the representative is
sitting

01:12:29.750 --> 01:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
sitting
 
01:12:33.189 --> 01:12:33.199 align:start position:0%
there is no microphone at that seat so i
 
01:12:35.030 --> 01:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
underst i will
 
01:12:37.910 --> 01:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
we will we will
 
01:12:40.709 --> 01:12:40.719 align:start position:0%
we will try to accommodate this but we
 
01:12:41.830 --> 01:12:41.840 align:start position:0%
are in the middle of the executive
 
01:12:43.350 --> 01:12:43.360 align:start position:0%
session so i
 
01:12:44.550 --> 01:12:44.560 align:start position:0%
having people move in the middle of the
 
01:12:47.030 --> 01:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
session is not something that i would
 
01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:54.229 align:start position:0%
session is not something that i would
encourage

01:12:54.229 --> 01:12:54.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:57.430 --> 01:12:57.440 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair um i
 
01:12:59.510 --> 01:12:59.520 align:start position:0%
want to answer a question that you had
 
01:13:02.950 --> 01:13:02.960 align:start position:0%
posed earlier um what what would we even
 
01:13:05.750 --> 01:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
do with the data and just to just to
 
01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:07.350 align:start position:0%
do with the data and just to just to
clarify

01:13:07.350 --> 01:13:07.360 align:start position:0%
clarify
 
01:13:09.669 --> 01:13:09.679 align:start position:0%
for you and for the committee that
 
01:13:12.669 --> 01:13:12.679 align:start position:0%
the department of justice gave out
 
01:13:15.590 --> 01:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
537 million dollars
 
01:13:18.790 --> 01:13:18.800 align:start position:0%
in law enforcement professional training
 
01:13:18.800 --> 01:13:20.070 align:start position:0%
in law enforcement professional training
grants

01:13:20.070 --> 01:13:20.080 align:start position:0%
grants
 
01:13:21.270 --> 01:13:21.280 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:13:22.950 --> 01:13:22.960 align:start position:0%
there's a breakdown of all these grants
 
01:13:24.310 --> 01:13:24.320 align:start position:0%
and a quick
 
01:13:28.709 --> 01:13:28.719 align:start position:0%
quick search of doj sponsored grants
 
01:13:31.350 --> 01:13:31.360 align:start position:0%
for law enforcement trainings actually
 
01:13:33.990 --> 01:13:34.000 align:start position:0%
require this kind of data so we'll we'll
 
01:13:35.430 --> 01:13:35.440 align:start position:0%
be free to
 
01:13:38.709 --> 01:13:38.719 align:start position:0%
pursue grant funding which we do with
 
01:13:41.590 --> 01:13:41.600 align:start position:0%
frequency in our law enforcement
 
01:13:44.070 --> 01:13:44.080 align:start position:0%
for training purposes
 
01:13:46.149 --> 01:13:46.159 align:start position:0%
but without this data our applications
 
01:13:48.229 --> 01:13:48.239 align:start position:0%
become exceptionally weak
 
01:13:50.470 --> 01:13:50.480 align:start position:0%
and we will get bumped to the bottom of
 
01:13:52.870 --> 01:13:52.880 align:start position:0%
the line for getting these kind of this
 
01:13:55.430 --> 01:13:55.440 align:start position:0%
kind of grant training funding um so
 
01:13:57.910 --> 01:13:57.920 align:start position:0%
that's one reason to collect this data
 
01:14:00.950 --> 01:14:00.960 align:start position:0%
is that we don't we repl we in the state
 
01:14:02.310 --> 01:14:02.320 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire
 
01:14:04.390 --> 01:14:04.400 align:start position:0%
rely heavily
 
01:14:08.310 --> 01:14:08.320 align:start position:0%
on getting grants that we either meet at
 
01:14:10.870 --> 01:14:10.880 align:start position:0%
halfway where we pit in half and the
 
01:14:13.430 --> 01:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
federal government puts in half or some
 
01:14:15.590 --> 01:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
in a lot of cases the federal government
 
01:14:18.149 --> 01:14:18.159 align:start position:0%
puts in more than two-thirds um and then
 
01:14:20.470 --> 01:14:20.480 align:start position:0%
we pony up the other third but without
 
01:14:20.480 --> 01:14:21.510 align:start position:0%
we pony up the other third but without
that

01:14:21.510 --> 01:14:21.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:14:21.520 --> 01:14:22.950 align:start position:0%
that
data

01:14:22.950 --> 01:14:22.960 align:start position:0%
data
 
01:14:25.590 --> 01:14:25.600 align:start position:0%
we're faced to either make a choice of
 
01:14:27.350 --> 01:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
not doing certain trainings not having
 
01:14:28.950 --> 01:14:28.960 align:start position:0%
those trainings available to us or
 
01:14:30.950 --> 01:14:30.960 align:start position:0%
paying full freight and we can't afford
 
01:14:34.550 --> 01:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
that so collecting data as anyone who
 
01:14:36.709 --> 01:14:36.719 align:start position:0%
works in a non-profit or a government
 
01:14:39.189 --> 01:14:39.199 align:start position:0%
agency knows that's the key to getting
 
01:14:40.830 --> 01:14:40.840 align:start position:0%
matching funding through the federal
 
01:14:44.630 --> 01:14:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:47.350 --> 01:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
if i can inquire has is there any was
 
01:14:48.550 --> 01:14:48.560 align:start position:0%
there any
 
01:14:50.070 --> 01:14:50.080 align:start position:0%
information presented to the committee
 
01:14:53.189 --> 01:14:53.199 align:start position:0%
that suggested that we were the state
 
01:14:54.630 --> 01:14:54.640 align:start position:0%
whether local or even the state police
 
01:14:57.590 --> 01:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
were not getting or being denied grants
 
01:14:59.510 --> 01:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
or funding from the federal government
 
01:14:59.520 --> 01:15:00.870 align:start position:0%
or funding from the federal government
because

01:15:00.870 --> 01:15:00.880 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:15:05.990 --> 01:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:07.990 --> 01:15:08.000 align:start position:0%
and i'm asking i actually i couldn't i
 
01:15:09.110 --> 01:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
wasn't here for the public hearing
 
01:15:13.189 --> 01:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:16.390 --> 01:15:16.400 align:start position:0%
if anyone can can address that
 
01:15:18.790 --> 01:15:18.800 align:start position:0%
no i can't but we've we've discussed a
 
01:15:21.030 --> 01:15:21.040 align:start position:0%
lot of things that we're not part of
 
01:15:24.790 --> 01:15:24.800 align:start position:0%
the testimony thank you
 
01:15:27.350 --> 01:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
um i'd like to i was watching this
 
01:15:29.830 --> 01:15:29.840 align:start position:0%
public testimony prior um and no that
 
01:15:32.470 --> 01:15:32.480 align:start position:0%
was not presented from anyone at the
 
01:15:32.480 --> 01:15:33.430 align:start position:0%
was not presented from anyone at the
desk

01:15:33.430 --> 01:15:33.440 align:start position:0%
desk
 
01:15:35.189 --> 01:15:35.199 align:start position:0%
but i will i will tell you from my
 
01:15:37.270 --> 01:15:37.280 align:start position:0%
perspective and from my experience with
 
01:15:39.430 --> 01:15:39.440 align:start position:0%
my own local law enforcement and our
 
01:15:42.390 --> 01:15:42.400 align:start position:0%
county law enforcement if you don't have
 
01:15:45.030 --> 01:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
all the information it's not worth the
 
01:15:47.510 --> 01:15:47.520 align:start position:0%
time and effort to apply for those
 
01:15:49.430 --> 01:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
grants and you end up leaving money
 
01:15:51.110 --> 01:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
potential money on the table for your
 
01:15:53.110 --> 01:15:53.120 align:start position:0%
county leaving money on the table for
 
01:15:55.430 --> 01:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
your municipality and we could be
 
01:15:57.110 --> 01:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
leaving money on the table for our state
 
01:15:59.990 --> 01:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
police so um
 
01:16:01.990 --> 01:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
saying that you know well have we ever
 
01:16:05.590 --> 01:16:05.600 align:start position:0%
been denied are we even applying because
 
01:16:07.189 --> 01:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
you know why put an application in that
 
01:16:08.709 --> 01:16:08.719 align:start position:0%
you can't finish
 
01:16:11.590 --> 01:16:11.600 align:start position:0%
so let's give our state police more data
 
01:16:13.350 --> 01:16:13.360 align:start position:0%
let's give our state more data and let's
 
01:16:14.790 --> 01:16:14.800 align:start position:0%
see what we can do with that and make
 
01:16:17.430 --> 01:16:17.440 align:start position:0%
something useful of it
 
01:16:19.830 --> 01:16:19.840 align:start position:0%
if i may inquire would would the
 
01:16:22.070 --> 01:16:22.080 align:start position:0%
representative support an amendment
 
01:16:24.790 --> 01:16:24.800 align:start position:0%
that would put an individual's race on
 
01:16:31.990 --> 01:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:33.990 --> 01:16:34.000 align:start position:0%
at this time i would support tabling
 
01:16:35.910 --> 01:16:35.920 align:start position:0%
this motion so that
 
01:16:39.110 --> 01:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
an appropriate amendment can be crafted
 
01:16:41.669 --> 01:16:41.679 align:start position:0%
that i believe the prime sponsor had
 
01:16:44.470 --> 01:16:44.480 align:start position:0%
reached out to members of this committee
 
01:16:49.110 --> 01:16:49.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:51.350 --> 01:16:51.360 align:start position:0%
but if if if an amen at the amendment
 
01:16:53.350 --> 01:16:53.360 align:start position:0%
included that putting race on on the
 
01:16:54.709 --> 01:16:54.719 align:start position:0%
driver's license because i know that
 
01:16:56.630 --> 01:16:56.640 align:start position:0%
that's been discussed in the past and
 
01:16:59.830 --> 01:16:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:02.149 --> 01:17:02.159 align:start position:0%
animated discussion so i'm just i
 
01:17:03.830 --> 01:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
understand why you might go that
 
01:17:05.030 --> 01:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
direction i'm just wondering if that's
 
01:17:09.669 --> 01:17:09.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:11.590 --> 01:17:11.600 align:start position:0%
is that for me yes
 
01:17:14.070 --> 01:17:14.080 align:start position:0%
so if that is supported by the prime
 
01:17:16.630 --> 01:17:16.640 align:start position:0%
sponsor and i believe the prime sponsor
 
01:17:18.390 --> 01:17:18.400 align:start position:0%
had conversations with other people on
 
01:17:22.630 --> 01:17:22.640 align:start position:0%
this committee i would support with
 
01:17:25.830 --> 01:17:25.840 align:start position:0%
withdrawing the motion to itl so that an
 
01:17:27.910 --> 01:17:27.920 align:start position:0%
amendment and a better offer a better
 
01:17:33.510 --> 01:17:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:36.149 --> 01:17:36.159 align:start position:0%
representative newman
 
01:17:37.350 --> 01:17:37.360 align:start position:0%
and the only reason i want to speak
 
01:17:39.270 --> 01:17:39.280 align:start position:0%
again is because there were three of us
 
01:17:41.110 --> 01:17:41.120 align:start position:0%
that actually had a briefing on this
 
01:17:43.189 --> 01:17:43.199 align:start position:0%
from the state police
 
01:17:45.270 --> 01:17:45.280 align:start position:0%
and i think that the information that
 
01:17:45.280 --> 01:17:46.310 align:start position:0%
and i think that the information that
that

01:17:46.310 --> 01:17:46.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:47.830 align:start position:0%
that
exists

01:17:47.830 --> 01:17:47.840 align:start position:0%
exists
 
01:17:50.229 --> 01:17:50.239 align:start position:0%
that is only taken when someone is
 
01:17:50.239 --> 01:17:51.830 align:start position:0%
that is only taken when someone is
arrested

01:17:51.830 --> 01:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
arrested
 
01:17:55.750 --> 01:17:55.760 align:start position:0%
showed how poor the input mechanism is
 
01:17:58.390 --> 01:17:58.400 align:start position:0%
in the software to be able to check
 
01:18:00.790 --> 01:18:00.800 align:start position:0%
those it's other or not
 
01:18:02.390 --> 01:18:02.400 align:start position:0%
i don't remember exactly what they are
 
01:18:04.390 --> 01:18:04.400 align:start position:0%
but they were insufficient
 
01:18:06.470 --> 01:18:06.480 align:start position:0%
and i think having that data that is
 
01:18:08.070 --> 01:18:08.080 align:start position:0%
already collected
 
01:18:10.709 --> 01:18:10.719 align:start position:0%
in a proper manner and is available if
 
01:18:13.189 --> 01:18:13.199 align:start position:0%
that could be included in a report
 
01:18:15.270 --> 01:18:15.280 align:start position:0%
that report would then be something that
 
01:18:16.950 --> 01:18:16.960 align:start position:0%
could be used in a lot of different
 
01:18:19.110 --> 01:18:19.120 align:start position:0%
places as has been already testified to
 
01:18:20.470 --> 01:18:20.480 align:start position:0%
to help
 
01:18:21.590 --> 01:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
not only
 
01:18:23.430 --> 01:18:23.440 align:start position:0%
get it on the license plate because
 
01:18:25.510 --> 01:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
people would understand what the issues
 
01:18:26.709 --> 01:18:26.719 align:start position:0%
are with that
 
01:18:27.750 --> 01:18:27.760 align:start position:0%
it would
 
01:18:30.870 --> 01:18:30.880 align:start position:0%
it would just also help to inform other
 
01:18:33.350 --> 01:18:33.360 align:start position:0%
localities that might be able to use
 
01:18:35.830 --> 01:18:35.840 align:start position:0%
whatever funds are available
 
01:18:37.990 --> 01:18:38.000 align:start position:0%
to improve their training based upon
 
01:18:40.870 --> 01:18:40.880 align:start position:0%
whatever that information showed as a
 
01:18:43.830 --> 01:18:43.840 align:start position:0%
conclusion as to what is going on when
 
01:18:45.910 --> 01:18:45.920 align:start position:0%
police inter when people interact with
 
01:18:48.790 --> 01:18:48.800 align:start position:0%
the police thank you
 
01:18:50.630 --> 01:18:50.640 align:start position:0%
representative bourdain
 
01:18:53.030 --> 01:18:53.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um
 
01:18:54.709 --> 01:18:54.719 align:start position:0%
well we can
 
01:18:57.910 --> 01:18:57.920 align:start position:0%
we can acknowledge that race is uh
 
01:19:00.229 --> 01:19:00.239 align:start position:0%
a controversial
 
01:19:03.350 --> 01:19:03.360 align:start position:0%
item for this particular bill
 
01:19:06.229 --> 01:19:06.239 align:start position:0%
other uh items in the
 
01:19:09.189 --> 01:19:09.199 align:start position:0%
data that was being gathered is also not
 
01:19:11.910 --> 01:19:11.920 align:start position:0%
available for
 
01:19:13.350 --> 01:19:13.360 align:start position:0%
law enforcement
 
01:19:15.750 --> 01:19:15.760 align:start position:0%
at that time for example the number of
 
01:19:15.760 --> 01:19:17.669 align:start position:0%
at that time for example the number of
citations

01:19:17.669 --> 01:19:17.679 align:start position:0%
citations
 
01:19:21.270 --> 01:19:21.280 align:start position:0%
issued the number of citations paid late
 
01:19:23.110 --> 01:19:23.120 align:start position:0%
and etc
 
01:19:26.470 --> 01:19:26.480 align:start position:0%
those are not available to uh
 
01:19:27.990 --> 01:19:28.000 align:start position:0%
the agency
 
01:19:30.630 --> 01:19:30.640 align:start position:0%
and i for that reason and that reason
 
01:19:33.669 --> 01:19:33.679 align:start position:0%
alone i would suggest that we contin do
 
01:19:36.470 --> 01:19:36.480 align:start position:0%
we uh itl just build
 
01:19:40.630 --> 01:19:40.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:43.110 --> 01:19:43.120 align:start position:0%
representative klein knight
 
01:19:46.870 --> 01:19:46.880 align:start position:0%
thank you chair um i can't speak for
 
01:19:49.030 --> 01:19:49.040 align:start position:0%
all of my colleagues but i would support
 
01:19:51.430 --> 01:19:51.440 align:start position:0%
an amendment that includes
 
01:19:53.990 --> 01:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
race identification markers but also
 
01:19:59.030 --> 01:19:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:00.630 --> 01:20:00.640 align:start position:0%
i think based on the
 
01:20:02.070 --> 01:20:02.080 align:start position:0%
conversations we've had and everyone's
 
01:20:03.430 --> 01:20:03.440 align:start position:0%
had a chance to speak i think what we
 
01:20:05.110 --> 01:20:05.120 align:start position:0%
can do is
 
01:20:07.270 --> 01:20:07.280 align:start position:0%
move the question and then we will go
 
01:20:09.510 --> 01:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
from there and
 
01:20:12.229 --> 01:20:12.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:20.790 --> 01:20:20.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:20.800 --> 01:20:42.149 align:start position:0%
 
them

01:20:42.149 --> 01:20:42.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:44.070 --> 01:20:44.080 align:start position:0%
at this time the matter will now be put
 
01:20:46.070 --> 01:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
to question if you were in support of
 
01:20:48.149 --> 01:20:48.159 align:start position:0%
the motion of inexpensive legislate
 
01:20:49.270 --> 01:20:49.280 align:start position:0%
please say
 
01:20:52.550 --> 01:20:52.560 align:start position:0%
yay if you were opposed please say nay
 
01:20:54.870 --> 01:20:54.880 align:start position:0%

happened to me in 20 um
 
01:34:10.870 --> 01:34:10.880 align:start position:0%
what is it now like 2020
 
01:34:12.470 --> 01:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
was it last year even how do you
 
01:34:14.390 --> 01:34:14.400 align:start position:0%
remember um
 
01:34:15.910 --> 01:34:15.920 align:start position:0%
in may of
 
01:34:19.270 --> 01:34:19.280 align:start position:0%
of last year with um you know in in my
 
01:34:22.229 --> 01:34:22.239 align:start position:0%
city of nashua on my in my community
 
01:34:25.430 --> 01:34:25.440 align:start position:0%
um we had defacement of public property
 
01:34:28.310 --> 01:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
we had on the national rail trail it's
 
01:34:30.229 --> 01:34:30.239 align:start position:0%
which is a you know a very
 
01:34:33.350 --> 01:34:33.360 align:start position:0%
um actually it was last year sorry um
 
01:34:35.350 --> 01:34:35.360 align:start position:0%
you know this is a pathway that most
 
01:34:37.990 --> 01:34:38.000 align:start position:0%
people most of my constituents walk
 
01:34:39.270 --> 01:34:39.280 align:start position:0%
through it's in the middle of my
 
01:34:42.709 --> 01:34:42.719 align:start position:0%
district um and there was defacement by
 
01:34:46.390 --> 01:34:46.400 align:start position:0%
these by this this this neo-nazi group
 
01:34:49.590 --> 01:34:49.600 align:start position:0%
um that basically put in you know this
 
01:34:51.510 --> 01:34:51.520 align:start position:0%
put swastikas
 
01:34:53.510 --> 01:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
they put up um
 
01:34:55.590 --> 01:34:55.600 align:start position:0%
this uh this you know
 
01:34:57.189 --> 01:34:57.199 align:start position:0%
make new england white
 
01:35:00.950 --> 01:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
um and it's a just incredibly um you
 
01:35:03.109 --> 01:35:03.119 align:start position:0%
know threatening to to a population of
 
01:35:05.189 --> 01:35:05.199 align:start position:0%
people that most of my cons have a
 
01:35:07.830 --> 01:35:07.840 align:start position:0%
pretty large latino district i think the
 
01:35:09.350 --> 01:35:09.360 align:start position:0%
largest in the state
 
01:35:11.189 --> 01:35:11.199 align:start position:0%
um and so
 
01:35:13.109 --> 01:35:13.119 align:start position:0%
and you know and also anti-semitic like
 
01:35:16.470 --> 01:35:16.480 align:start position:0%
i said so hurting the folks who are also
 
01:35:18.790 --> 01:35:18.800 align:start position:0%
of that faith uh who live in that area
 
01:35:18.800 --> 01:35:19.669 align:start position:0%
of that faith uh who live in that area
so

01:35:19.669 --> 01:35:19.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:35:21.270 --> 01:35:21.280 align:start position:0%
you know this would be
 
01:35:23.750 --> 01:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
this bill would aim to target like you
 
01:35:26.149 --> 01:35:26.159 align:start position:0%
know things like this where the public
 
01:35:28.149 --> 01:35:28.159 align:start position:0%
you know public place a place that many
 
01:35:30.149 --> 01:35:30.159 align:start position:0%
constituents walk through many cases get
 
01:35:31.109 --> 01:35:31.119 align:start position:0%
to see
 
01:35:33.109 --> 01:35:33.119 align:start position:0%
would have you know would
 
01:35:34.390 --> 01:35:34.400 align:start position:0%
it would basically make it so that you
 
01:35:36.149 --> 01:35:36.159 align:start position:0%
know if somebody were to do things like
 
01:35:37.750 --> 01:35:37.760 align:start position:0%
this that we would that that law
 
01:35:39.910 --> 01:35:39.920 align:start position:0%
enforcement could get involved and
 
01:35:42.390 --> 01:35:42.400 align:start position:0%
could actually do something do something
 
01:35:44.550 --> 01:35:44.560 align:start position:0%
to actually try to get folks like this
 
01:35:47.030 --> 01:35:47.040 align:start position:0%
it would also add you know issues around
 
01:35:47.040 --> 01:35:48.310 align:start position:0%
it would also add you know issues around
discrimination

01:35:48.310 --> 01:35:48.320 align:start position:0%
discrimination
 
01:35:49.990 --> 01:35:50.000 align:start position:0%
um for our
 
01:35:52.709 --> 01:35:52.719 align:start position:0%
um for our you know that target certain
 
01:35:52.719 --> 01:35:53.910 align:start position:0%
um for our you know that target certain
groups

01:35:53.910 --> 01:35:53.920 align:start position:0%
groups
 
01:35:55.990 --> 01:35:56.000 align:start position:0%
these groups have been you know i put
 
01:35:58.070 --> 01:35:58.080 align:start position:0%
these this list of folks together from
 
01:35:58.080 --> 01:35:59.350 align:start position:0%
these this list of folks together from
uh

01:35:59.350 --> 01:35:59.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:36:01.109 --> 01:36:01.119 align:start position:0%
from some of the you know from the
 
01:36:02.790 --> 01:36:02.800 align:start position:0%
language that was recently added into
 
01:36:05.990 --> 01:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
our budget from last year um so you know
 
01:36:06.870 --> 01:36:06.880 align:start position:0%
i think
 
01:36:09.270 --> 01:36:09.280 align:start position:0%
nobody deserves to live in fear nobody
 
01:36:11.109 --> 01:36:11.119 align:start position:0%
should be worried about you know whether
 
01:36:13.270 --> 01:36:13.280 align:start position:0%
they're taking their dog out for a walk
 
01:36:15.830 --> 01:36:15.840 align:start position:0%
whether they're you know going out to
 
01:36:18.229 --> 01:36:18.239 align:start position:0%
downtown to grab a drink with a friend
 
01:36:19.750 --> 01:36:19.760 align:start position:0%
on their way out there to feel like
 
01:36:21.590 --> 01:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
their life is being threatened feel like
 
01:36:23.830 --> 01:36:23.840 align:start position:0%
they've uh like that they that their
 
01:36:26.470 --> 01:36:26.480 align:start position:0%
faith is being is being threatened so
 
01:36:28.390 --> 01:36:28.400 align:start position:0%
um you know i put this bill out there
 
01:36:29.669 --> 01:36:29.679 align:start position:0%
and then the other reason was because
 
01:36:31.990 --> 01:36:32.000 align:start position:0%
after you know i called this called this
 
01:36:33.990 --> 01:36:34.000 align:start position:0%
public defacement out the group went
 
01:36:35.750 --> 01:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
after myself
 
01:36:37.109 --> 01:36:37.119 align:start position:0%
and so i
 
01:36:38.950 --> 01:36:38.960 align:start position:0%
you know just as they are going after
 
01:36:40.550 --> 01:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
folks right now in the seacoast it's
 
01:36:43.109 --> 01:36:43.119 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's wrong and we want to be
 
01:36:45.669 --> 01:36:45.679 align:start position:0%
able to try to get you know get folks
 
01:36:49.590 --> 01:36:49.600 align:start position:0%
like this and uh and you know be able to
 
01:36:53.669 --> 01:36:53.679 align:start position:0%
to be uh be able to to to prosecute them
 
01:36:56.310 --> 01:36:56.320 align:start position:0%
so um with that you know i can answer
 
01:36:57.510 --> 01:36:57.520 align:start position:0%

groups like this
 
01:38:09.590 --> 01:38:09.600 align:start position:0%
or other hate-based groups have
 
01:38:09.600 --> 01:38:10.790 align:start position:0%
or other hate-based groups have
threatened

01:38:10.790 --> 01:38:10.800 align:start position:0%

01:38:14.070 --> 01:38:14.080 align:start position:0%
uh citizens with posters or flyers
 
01:38:16.950 --> 01:38:16.960 align:start position:0%
in their communities yeah i uh thank you
 
01:38:18.070 --> 01:38:18.080 align:start position:0%
for the question yeah definitely i've
 
01:38:19.510 --> 01:38:19.520 align:start position:0%
seen it in uh like i said in the
 
01:38:21.030 --> 01:38:21.040 align:start position:0%
seacoast right now
 
01:38:23.510 --> 01:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
uh recently with um the targeting of a
 
01:38:26.950 --> 01:38:26.960 align:start position:0%
certain um uh it was a theatrical group
 
01:38:30.070 --> 01:38:30.080 align:start position:0%
so um yeah i mean it's real it's it's
 
01:38:32.390 --> 01:38:32.400 align:start position:0%
out there still and uh it's really
 
01:38:38.950 --> 01:38:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:42.149 --> 01:38:42.159 align:start position:0%
if i may inquire of a question was the
 
01:38:45.350 --> 01:38:45.360 align:start position:0%
individuals who uh
 
01:38:46.790 --> 01:38:46.800 align:start position:0%
made made their spray painted the
 
01:38:46.800 --> 01:38:48.070 align:start position:0%
made made their spray painted the
graffiti

01:38:48.070 --> 01:38:48.080 align:start position:0%
graffiti
 
01:38:50.390 --> 01:38:50.400 align:start position:0%
what not what what was the consequence
 
01:38:51.669 --> 01:38:51.679 align:start position:0%
of that
 
01:38:53.510 --> 01:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
um i mean currently there hasn't been
 
01:38:55.350 --> 01:38:55.360 align:start position:0%
any consequences for them they haven't
 
01:38:57.030 --> 01:38:57.040 align:start position:0%
been um
 
01:38:59.510 --> 01:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
nobody has been brought in for charges
 
01:39:01.430 --> 01:39:01.440 align:start position:0%
against them i know that it's probably
 
01:39:03.830 --> 01:39:03.840 align:start position:0%
an active investigation but nothing has
 
01:39:06.310 --> 01:39:06.320 align:start position:0%
been done of yet
 
01:39:06.320 --> 01:39:07.270 align:start position:0%
been done of yet
and

01:39:07.270 --> 01:39:07.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:39:10.310 --> 01:39:10.320 align:start position:0%
my my follow-up question is and i'm just
 
01:39:13.990 --> 01:39:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:15.910 --> 01:39:15.920 align:start position:0%
uh graffiti on public property isn't
 
01:39:15.920 --> 01:39:17.270 align:start position:0%
uh graffiti on public property isn't
that

01:39:17.270 --> 01:39:17.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:39:20.070 --> 01:39:20.080 align:start position:0%
a crime already so i'm just wondering is
 
01:39:21.510 --> 01:39:21.520 align:start position:0%
there any i don't i don't know the
 
01:39:23.189 --> 01:39:23.199 align:start position:0%
answer is what's happening with the
 
01:39:25.750 --> 01:39:25.760 align:start position:0%
status that yeah i think you know and i
 
01:39:27.510 --> 01:39:27.520 align:start position:0%
have i have friends who participate in
 
01:39:30.070 --> 01:39:30.080 align:start position:0%
graffiti art um some get commissioned
 
01:39:31.270 --> 01:39:31.280 align:start position:0%
and they get to put it up and they get
 
01:39:33.350 --> 01:39:33.360 align:start position:0%
paid for it but this so i'm i'm not
 
01:39:35.430 --> 01:39:35.440 align:start position:0%
against the practice of graffiti on like
 
01:39:37.590 --> 01:39:37.600 align:start position:0%
especially with commission but you know
 
01:39:41.590 --> 01:39:41.600 align:start position:0%
specific targeting of groups of hate of
 
01:39:43.669 --> 01:39:43.679 align:start position:0%
hate speech that's when i think you know
 
01:39:45.270 --> 01:39:45.280 align:start position:0%
when art i think believe crosses that
 
01:39:48.550 --> 01:39:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:49.430 --> 01:39:49.440 align:start position:0%
representative newman you were
 
01:39:49.440 --> 01:39:50.950 align:start position:0%
representative newman you were
recognized

01:39:50.950 --> 01:39:50.960 align:start position:0%
recognized
 
01:39:53.590 --> 01:39:53.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
01:39:56.390 --> 01:39:56.400 align:start position:0%
as i read the bill this is this is not
 
01:39:59.590 --> 01:39:59.600 align:start position:0%
aimed at just plain graffiti
 
01:40:02.709 --> 01:40:02.719 align:start position:0%
and it appears that it says the property
 
01:40:05.590 --> 01:40:05.600 align:start position:0%
of another with the purpose to coerce or
 
01:40:08.870 --> 01:40:08.880 align:start position:0%
terrorize any person or the people of
 
01:40:10.950 --> 01:40:10.960 align:start position:0%
and then it has several characteristics
 
01:40:13.189 --> 01:40:13.199 align:start position:0%
is that a correct understanding of what
 
01:40:15.109 --> 01:40:15.119 align:start position:0%
you intend with the bill right so yeah
 
01:40:17.189 --> 01:40:17.199 align:start position:0%
the first section b addresses graffiti
 
01:40:20.790 --> 01:40:20.800 align:start position:0%
section uh c addresses uh property much
 
01:40:22.550 --> 01:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
l is a much broader
 
01:40:22.560 --> 01:40:24.229 align:start position:0%
l is a much broader
um

01:40:24.229 --> 01:40:24.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:26.149 --> 01:40:26.159 align:start position:0%
aim at just property also owned by
 
01:40:28.470 --> 01:40:28.480 align:start position:0%
another um and i'll be i'll be clear
 
01:40:30.390 --> 01:40:30.400 align:start position:0%
very open to any amendments that the
 
01:40:32.229 --> 01:40:32.239 align:start position:0%
committee would like to do on the spell
 
01:40:33.830 --> 01:40:33.840 align:start position:0%
as well
 
01:40:34.830 --> 01:40:34.840 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
01:40:36.629 --> 01:40:36.639 align:start position:0%
mr representative newman you're
 
01:40:36.639 --> 01:40:37.750 align:start position:0%
mr representative newman you're
recognized

01:40:37.750 --> 01:40:37.760 align:start position:0%
recognized
 
01:40:40.470 --> 01:40:40.480 align:start position:0%
uh and it also appears that that phrase
 
01:40:43.109 --> 01:40:43.119 align:start position:0%
about terrorizing and coercing is in all
 
01:40:43.119 --> 01:40:44.070 align:start position:0%
about terrorizing and coercing is in all
three

01:40:44.070 --> 01:40:44.080 align:start position:0%
three
 
01:40:46.550 --> 01:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
paragraphs is that correct right thank
 
01:40:46.560 --> 01:40:50.950 align:start position:0%
paragraphs is that correct right thank
you

01:40:50.950 --> 01:40:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:52.950 --> 01:40:52.960 align:start position:0%
representative rory
 
01:40:54.709 --> 01:40:54.719 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh thank you for
 
01:40:55.990 --> 01:40:56.000 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:56.790 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

01:40:56.790 --> 01:40:56.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:00.390 --> 01:41:00.400 align:start position:0%
so the the current law
 
01:41:02.149 --> 01:41:02.159 align:start position:0%
already has the part about the the
 
01:41:05.669 --> 01:41:05.679 align:start position:0%
coercion and terrorizing any person
 
01:41:08.470 --> 01:41:08.480 align:start position:0%
this this adds public property
 
01:41:10.629 --> 01:41:10.639 align:start position:0%
but then it goes on
 
01:41:13.030 --> 01:41:13.040 align:start position:0%
so my question is why is it necessary to
 
01:41:15.350 --> 01:41:15.360 align:start position:0%
add all the different
 
01:41:17.109 --> 01:41:17.119 align:start position:0%
different identities when the current
 
01:41:19.750 --> 01:41:19.760 align:start position:0%
loss is any person
 
01:41:23.030 --> 01:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question i think um
 
01:41:25.189 --> 01:41:25.199 align:start position:0%
i think because of like for example this
 
01:41:26.950 --> 01:41:26.960 align:start position:0%
instance which is not this isn't an
 
01:41:28.790 --> 01:41:28.800 align:start position:0%
isolated instance as we've seen already
 
01:41:29.830 --> 01:41:29.840 align:start position:0%
this year
 
01:41:31.990 --> 01:41:32.000 align:start position:0%
um has been targeted specifically
 
01:41:35.109 --> 01:41:35.119 align:start position:0%
because of a person's you know uh sexual
 
01:41:36.709 --> 01:41:36.719 align:start position:0%
orientation uh
 
01:41:40.709 --> 01:41:40.719 align:start position:0%
people's faith and people's uh
 
01:41:42.390 --> 01:41:42.400 align:start position:0%
race and ethnicity specifically it
 
01:41:43.669 --> 01:41:43.679 align:start position:0%
wasn't like
 
01:41:46.229 --> 01:41:46.239 align:start position:0%
like ex-person you are the worst or it
 
01:41:48.149 --> 01:41:48.159 align:start position:0%
wasn't like it was it was specifically
 
01:41:51.669 --> 01:41:51.679 align:start position:0%
directed um at a at a certain at these
 
01:41:54.310 --> 01:41:54.320 align:start position:0%
different groups so
 
01:42:01.750 --> 01:42:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:04.390 --> 01:42:04.400 align:start position:0%
representative klein knight um thank you
 
01:42:04.400 --> 01:42:05.430 align:start position:0%
representative klein knight um thank you
chair

01:42:05.430 --> 01:42:05.440 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:42:07.590 --> 01:42:07.600 align:start position:0%
thank you representative espedia
 
01:42:10.390 --> 01:42:10.400 align:start position:0%
what happens to communities when
 
01:42:12.790 --> 01:42:12.800 align:start position:0%
this kind of hate crime goes uh
 
01:42:12.800 --> 01:42:14.709 align:start position:0%
this kind of hate crime goes uh
unpunished

01:42:14.709 --> 01:42:14.719 align:start position:0%
unpunished
 
01:42:16.709 --> 01:42:16.719 align:start position:0%
you know i thank you for the question i
 
01:42:17.990 --> 01:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
i think
 
01:42:19.910 --> 01:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
folks start to
 
01:42:22.229 --> 01:42:22.239 align:start position:0%
well there's two things one people start
 
01:42:22.239 --> 01:42:23.430 align:start position:0%
well there's two things one people start
feel

01:42:23.430 --> 01:42:23.440 align:start position:0%
feel
 
01:42:23.440 --> 01:42:25.510 align:start position:0%
feel
um

01:42:25.510 --> 01:42:25.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:26.870 --> 01:42:26.880 align:start position:0%
feel a little bit more struck to their
 
01:42:29.350 --> 01:42:29.360 align:start position:0%
core about how they feel as a person i
 
01:42:31.990 --> 01:42:32.000 align:start position:0%
know especially if if my i'll put it as
 
01:42:33.669 --> 01:42:33.679 align:start position:0%
an example if i was if i some
 
01:42:35.750 --> 01:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
anti-catholic you know rhetoric thrown
 
01:42:36.709 --> 01:42:36.719 align:start position:0%
at me
 
01:42:38.390 --> 01:42:38.400 align:start position:0%
i would feel a little bit more shocked
 
01:42:40.790 --> 01:42:40.800 align:start position:0%
to my you know my belief as a catholic
 
01:42:43.189 --> 01:42:43.199 align:start position:0%
united understand do i feel safe
 
01:42:45.350 --> 01:42:45.360 align:start position:0%
which is you know for a lot of for a lot
 
01:42:46.950 --> 01:42:46.960 align:start position:0%
of people the jewish faith that is
 
01:42:48.790 --> 01:42:48.800 align:start position:0%
somehow how they feel probably at this
 
01:42:48.800 --> 01:42:49.750 align:start position:0%
somehow how they feel probably at this
moment

01:42:49.750 --> 01:42:49.760 align:start position:0%
moment
 
01:42:52.310 --> 01:42:52.320 align:start position:0%
um so that's one and two
 
01:42:54.629 --> 01:42:54.639 align:start position:0%
one of the one of the few silver linings
 
01:42:56.470 --> 01:42:56.480 align:start position:0%
of the situation that happened
 
01:42:59.350 --> 01:42:59.360 align:start position:0%
was that a i think the community just
 
01:43:01.830 --> 01:43:01.840 align:start position:0%
became a little bit closer and had knows
 
01:43:03.910 --> 01:43:03.920 align:start position:0%
that you know they had to stick together
 
01:43:05.669 --> 01:43:05.679 align:start position:0%
so it served as a point of like you know
 
01:43:07.590 --> 01:43:07.600 align:start position:0%
we need to come together at this point
 
01:43:09.590 --> 01:43:09.600 align:start position:0%
but then b also
 
01:43:11.750 --> 01:43:11.760 align:start position:0%
i think folks started looking into it
 
01:43:12.709 --> 01:43:12.719 align:start position:0%
and taking it a little bit more
 
01:43:12.719 --> 01:43:18.550 align:start position:0%
and taking it a little bit more
seriously

01:43:18.550 --> 01:43:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:20.149 --> 01:43:20.159 align:start position:0%
represent klein knight you recognize for
 
01:43:21.590 --> 01:43:21.600 align:start position:0%
a follow-up
 
01:43:23.350 --> 01:43:23.360 align:start position:0%
thank you chair thank you uh
 
01:43:26.390 --> 01:43:26.400 align:start position:0%
representative espidia um
 
01:43:27.910 --> 01:43:27.920 align:start position:0%
would you say
 
01:43:29.910 --> 01:43:29.920 align:start position:0%
because it goes unaddressed as you were
 
01:43:32.070 --> 01:43:32.080 align:start position:0%
just saying uh that it would embolden
 
01:43:34.070 --> 01:43:34.080 align:start position:0%
more hate crimes possibly leading to
 
01:43:35.990 --> 01:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
what we experienced and witnessed in
 
01:43:39.109 --> 01:43:39.119 align:start position:0%
texas last week um thank you for the
 
01:43:39.119 --> 01:43:40.229 align:start position:0%
texas last week um thank you for the
question

01:43:40.229 --> 01:43:40.239 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:43:41.510 --> 01:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
i mean i think
 
01:43:43.030 --> 01:43:43.040 align:start position:0%
when you know
 
01:43:44.629 --> 01:43:44.639 align:start position:0%
things escalate so when one thing
 
01:43:46.310 --> 01:43:46.320 align:start position:0%
happens it goes unchecked they think it
 
01:43:49.350 --> 01:43:49.360 align:start position:0%
just continues to grow and it's you know
 
01:43:51.030 --> 01:43:51.040 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't want to link the two things
 
01:43:53.189 --> 01:43:53.199 align:start position:0%
together but i would say that there i
 
01:43:55.350 --> 01:43:55.360 align:start position:0%
personally think there is been a rise in
 
01:43:57.910 --> 01:43:57.920 align:start position:0%
anti-semitism in our in our country and
 
01:43:59.189 --> 01:43:59.199 align:start position:0%
i think you know
 
01:44:00.870 --> 01:44:00.880 align:start position:0%
part of it is we gotta we gotta step it
 
01:44:05.669 --> 01:44:05.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:10.229 --> 01:44:10.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:12.310 --> 01:44:12.320 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question
 
01:44:12.320 --> 01:44:13.109 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question
um

01:44:13.109 --> 01:44:13.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:14.629 --> 01:44:14.639 align:start position:0%
so pardon me i'm just trying to
 
01:44:17.350 --> 01:44:17.360 align:start position:0%
understand your intent with bill
 
01:44:17.360 --> 01:44:18.310 align:start position:0%
understand your intent with bill
um

01:44:18.310 --> 01:44:18.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:20.470 --> 01:44:20.480 align:start position:0%
it seems like your intent and i my
 
01:44:22.310 --> 01:44:22.320 align:start position:0%
question is am i representing it
 
01:44:24.629 --> 01:44:24.639 align:start position:0%
correctly i'm you know active listening
 
01:44:25.910 --> 01:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
i just want to say back to you and make
 
01:44:27.910 --> 01:44:27.920 align:start position:0%
sure i understand
 
01:44:29.910 --> 01:44:29.920 align:start position:0%
is do i understand correctly that your
 
01:44:33.109 --> 01:44:33.119 align:start position:0%
intent is that if an action
 
01:44:36.229 --> 01:44:36.239 align:start position:0%
is considered criminal threatening
 
01:44:38.149 --> 01:44:38.159 align:start position:0%
against an individual but we should
 
01:44:41.350 --> 01:44:41.360 align:start position:0%
expand that to also be considered
 
01:44:43.270 --> 01:44:43.280 align:start position:0%
criminal threatening
 
01:44:44.550 --> 01:44:44.560 align:start position:0%
that we should expand criminal
 
01:44:46.070 --> 01:44:46.080 align:start position:0%
threatening to include actions that are
 
01:44:47.910 --> 01:44:47.920 align:start position:0%
directed not at an individual but at a
 
01:44:50.790 --> 01:44:50.800 align:start position:0%
group an unspecified generic group
 
01:44:53.669 --> 01:44:53.679 align:start position:0%
basically so if someone says
 
01:44:55.910 --> 01:44:55.920 align:start position:0%
you know i'm going to kill joe
 
01:44:57.669 --> 01:44:57.679 align:start position:0%
that's that's criminal threatening
 
01:45:00.149 --> 01:45:00.159 align:start position:0%
currently and you want to expand that
 
01:45:02.629 --> 01:45:02.639 align:start position:0%
criminal threatening to be i'm gonna
 
01:45:02.639 --> 01:45:04.629 align:start position:0%
criminal threatening to be i'm gonna
kill

01:45:04.629 --> 01:45:04.639 align:start position:0%
kill
 
01:45:06.070 --> 01:45:06.080 align:start position:0%
all people who share joe's
 
01:45:08.390 --> 01:45:08.400 align:start position:0%
characteristics whether or not i can
 
01:45:10.310 --> 01:45:10.320 align:start position:0%
name them right
 
01:45:16.709 --> 01:45:16.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:18.229 --> 01:45:18.239 align:start position:0%
representative rhodes
 
01:45:19.750 --> 01:45:19.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
01:45:21.990 --> 01:45:22.000 align:start position:0%
taking my question um
 
01:45:25.030 --> 01:45:25.040 align:start position:0%
i'm actually reading um pretty much what
 
01:45:27.750 --> 01:45:27.760 align:start position:0%
representative roy read
 
01:45:30.390 --> 01:45:30.400 align:start position:0%
it i mean it actually says criminal
 
01:45:32.550 --> 01:45:32.560 align:start position:0%
threatening by physical conduct the
 
01:45:35.430 --> 01:45:35.440 align:start position:0%
person purposely places or attempts to
 
01:45:38.470 --> 01:45:38.480 align:start position:0%
place another in fear of imminent bodily
 
01:45:41.109 --> 01:45:41.119 align:start position:0%
injury or physical contact
 
01:45:43.669 --> 01:45:43.679 align:start position:0%
i think i'm just failing to realize what
 
01:45:46.310 --> 01:45:46.320 align:start position:0%
it what is the difference it
 
01:45:48.229 --> 01:45:48.239 align:start position:0%
i mean it actually says that place
 
01:45:50.229 --> 01:45:50.239 align:start position:0%
another in fear or imminent bodily
 
01:45:50.239 --> 01:45:51.830 align:start position:0%
another in fear or imminent bodily
injury

01:45:51.830 --> 01:45:51.840 align:start position:0%
injury
 
01:45:51.840 --> 01:45:53.830 align:start position:0%
injury
um

01:45:53.830 --> 01:45:53.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:55.350 --> 01:45:55.360 align:start position:0%
that's a good question i appreciate the
 
01:45:57.669 --> 01:45:57.679 align:start position:0%
question um
 
01:46:02.870 --> 01:46:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:04.709 --> 01:46:04.719 align:start position:0%
so like i'm trying to park in this back
 
01:46:06.629 --> 01:46:06.639 align:start position:0%
to the exam like what the situation that
 
01:46:08.470 --> 01:46:08.480 align:start position:0%
happened to myself like i think
 
01:46:08.480 --> 01:46:10.070 align:start position:0%
happened to myself like i think
um

01:46:10.070 --> 01:46:10.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:11.830 --> 01:46:11.840 align:start position:0%
i think it wasn't originally like you
 
01:46:14.070 --> 01:46:14.080 align:start position:0%
know it wasn't a
 
01:46:16.229 --> 01:46:16.239 align:start position:0%
it mentioned it and i said you know we
 
01:46:18.070 --> 01:46:18.080 align:start position:0%
want like when people directed i mean we
 
01:46:19.990 --> 01:46:20.000 align:start position:0%
want people like you out
 
01:46:22.310 --> 01:46:22.320 align:start position:0%
like like does that you know what does
 
01:46:24.229 --> 01:46:24.239 align:start position:0%
that mean um
 
01:46:26.470 --> 01:46:26.480 align:start position:0%
like and i think for myself i see that
 
01:46:26.480 --> 01:46:27.590 align:start position:0%
like and i think for myself i see that
as

01:46:27.590 --> 01:46:27.600 align:start position:0%
as
 
01:46:29.669 --> 01:46:29.679 align:start position:0%
like do we want to like like remove
 
01:46:31.189 --> 01:46:31.199 align:start position:0%
people that look like yourself so i
 
01:46:31.199 --> 01:46:31.910 align:start position:0%
people that look like yourself so i
think

01:46:31.910 --> 01:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:46:35.590 --> 01:46:35.600 align:start position:0%
i think looking at this as more of
 
01:46:37.830 --> 01:46:37.840 align:start position:0%
looking at a larger idea of like okay so
 
01:46:39.910 --> 01:46:39.920 align:start position:0%
it's not just myself but also like these
 
01:46:41.750 --> 01:46:41.760 align:start position:0%
groups is what i'm trying to get the aim
 
01:46:43.750 --> 01:46:43.760 align:start position:0%
out of like trying to expand it so make
 
01:46:45.430 --> 01:46:45.440 align:start position:0%
sure that you know people who are
 
01:46:46.950 --> 01:46:46.960 align:start position:0%
targeted because of their
 
01:46:49.510 --> 01:46:49.520 align:start position:0%
their their their race their religion
 
01:46:51.270 --> 01:46:51.280 align:start position:0%
their disability things like that that
 
01:46:52.950 --> 01:46:52.960 align:start position:0%
they that they are more protected as
 
01:46:57.750 --> 01:46:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:04.629 --> 01:47:04.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:05.990 --> 01:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
i was trying to figure out how i want to
 
01:47:07.590 --> 01:47:07.600 align:start position:0%
say this
 
01:47:10.310 --> 01:47:10.320 align:start position:0%
when i look at the addition with the
 
01:47:13.590 --> 01:47:13.600 align:start position:0%
people one age sex gender those types of
 
01:47:13.600 --> 01:47:16.149 align:start position:0%
people one age sex gender those types of
terms

01:47:16.149 --> 01:47:16.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:18.709 --> 01:47:18.719 align:start position:0%
i look at that as being person
 
01:47:21.510 --> 01:47:21.520 align:start position:0%
so when it says any person
 
01:47:23.510 --> 01:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
i think would cover all of that
 
01:47:26.310 --> 01:47:26.320 align:start position:0%
this is just a thought
 
01:47:29.030 --> 01:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
but i would add the religion and
 
01:47:31.109 --> 01:47:31.119 align:start position:0%
national origins
 
01:47:34.950 --> 01:47:34.960 align:start position:0%
but i do believe that the term person
 
01:47:36.950 --> 01:47:36.960 align:start position:0%
would cover all the others that are
 
01:47:39.030 --> 01:47:39.040 align:start position:0%
listed there
 
01:47:39.040 --> 01:47:45.830 align:start position:0%
listed there
okay

01:47:45.830 --> 01:47:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:48.310 --> 01:47:48.320 align:start position:0%
was there a question there well
 
01:47:49.830 --> 01:47:49.840 align:start position:0%
it's not a question that's a comment i
 
01:47:53.030 --> 01:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
think do i make a question
 
01:47:55.189 --> 01:47:55.199 align:start position:0%
would you be open to amending yes i
 
01:47:56.229 --> 01:47:56.239 align:start position:0%
would be i
 
01:47:57.830 --> 01:47:57.840 align:start position:0%
yeah as i mentioned i would be open to
 
01:48:00.310 --> 01:48:00.320 align:start position:0%
amending this and even if we wanted to
 
01:48:02.830 --> 01:48:02.840 align:start position:0%
have a have a work session on it
 
01:48:04.390 --> 01:48:04.400 align:start position:0%
representative harry gareth the former
 
01:48:05.430 --> 01:48:05.440 align:start position:0%
chair of this committee has taught me
 
01:48:05.440 --> 01:48:12.950 align:start position:0%
chair of this committee has taught me
well

01:48:12.950 --> 01:48:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:28.229 --> 01:48:28.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:29.669 --> 01:48:29.679 align:start position:0%
i believe that if they're referring to
 
01:48:32.229 --> 01:48:32.239 align:start position:0%
rsa 631
 
01:48:40.390 --> 01:48:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:41.990 --> 01:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
and if you are looking that up if you do
 
01:48:44.229 --> 01:48:44.239 align:start position:0%
go to the end of that rsa there is a
 
01:48:47.030 --> 01:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
definition for the term terrorize
 
01:48:57.189 --> 01:48:57.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:58.950 --> 01:48:58.960 align:start position:0%
and this time i want to thank the
 
01:49:00.709 --> 01:49:00.719 align:start position:0%
representative for his testimony
 
01:49:16.070 --> 01:49:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:22.709 --> 01:50:22.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:24.950 --> 01:50:24.960 align:start position:0%
right at this time we have to just
 
01:50:27.270 --> 01:50:27.280 align:start position:0%
recognize you
 
01:50:28.550 --> 01:50:28.560 align:start position:0%
at this time the committee will
 
01:50:28.560 --> 01:50:29.510 align:start position:0%
at this time the committee will
recognize

01:50:29.510 --> 01:50:29.520 align:start position:0%
recognize
 
01:50:35.430 --> 01:50:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:36.629 --> 01:50:36.639 align:start position:0%
there we go
 
01:50:38.229 --> 01:50:38.239 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to have
 
01:50:39.910 --> 01:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
public hearings and to discuss these
 
01:50:41.510 --> 01:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
matters absolutely under the
 
01:50:43.830 --> 01:50:43.840 align:start position:0%
circumstances of having um
 
01:50:46.149 --> 01:50:46.159 align:start position:0%
something anti-semitic on a railway is
 
01:50:48.310 --> 01:50:48.320 align:start position:0%
very alarming and not appropriate and
 
01:50:50.229 --> 01:50:50.239 align:start position:0%
not okay i would hope that we already
 
01:50:52.470 --> 01:50:52.480 align:start position:0%
have littering bills and hate crime
 
01:50:55.430 --> 01:50:55.440 align:start position:0%
bills laws that could be applied to
 
01:50:57.189 --> 01:50:57.199 align:start position:0%
groups especially when we can identify
 
01:50:59.589 --> 01:50:59.599 align:start position:0%
who did those types of acts
 
01:51:01.350 --> 01:51:01.360 align:start position:0%
the only thing the reason i wanted to
 
01:51:03.510 --> 01:51:03.520 align:start position:0%
speak is that it talks about anything
 
01:51:07.109 --> 01:51:07.119 align:start position:0%
that would coerce um in that includes
 
01:51:09.669 --> 01:51:09.679 align:start position:0%
like religion and national origin
 
01:51:12.629 --> 01:51:12.639 align:start position:0%
so my question is would this
 
01:51:15.750 --> 01:51:15.760 align:start position:0%
potentially be used that if say someone
 
01:51:15.760 --> 01:51:16.709 align:start position:0%
potentially be used that if say someone
said

01:51:16.709 --> 01:51:16.719 align:start position:0%
said
 
01:51:18.830 --> 01:51:18.840 align:start position:0%
you know the catholic church is having a
 
01:51:22.149 --> 01:51:22.159 align:start position:0%
potluck sunday at 2 p.m open to the
 
01:51:23.589 --> 01:51:23.599 align:start position:0%
public and they put it at an
 
01:51:23.599 --> 01:51:24.870 align:start position:0%
public and they put it at an
intersection

01:51:24.870 --> 01:51:24.880 align:start position:0%
intersection
 
01:51:27.589 --> 01:51:27.599 align:start position:0%
is that public coercion
 
01:51:30.149 --> 01:51:30.159 align:start position:0%
to participate in a specific race it
 
01:51:32.310 --> 01:51:32.320 align:start position:0%
just it feels like as we keep putting
 
01:51:34.470 --> 01:51:34.480 align:start position:0%
more and more legislation on the books
 
01:51:36.790 --> 01:51:36.800 align:start position:0%
that sometimes then later on you know
 
01:51:37.990 --> 01:51:38.000 align:start position:0%
someone put
 
01:51:40.629 --> 01:51:40.639 align:start position:0%
an elected official
 
01:51:42.870 --> 01:51:42.880 align:start position:0%
at an intersection that's a public
 
01:51:45.910 --> 01:51:45.920 align:start position:0%
spot is that now coercion
 
01:51:48.870 --> 01:51:48.880 align:start position:0%
for that political party that political
 
01:51:51.510 --> 01:51:51.520 align:start position:0%
elected official like i just don't want
 
01:51:53.750 --> 01:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
to stifle free speech
 
01:51:57.030 --> 01:51:57.040 align:start position:0%
when it's maybe coercion but not
 
01:52:00.149 --> 01:52:00.159 align:start position:0%
a hate crime so i guess the definition
 
01:52:03.030 --> 01:52:03.040 align:start position:0%
of coercing people to
 
01:52:06.390 --> 01:52:06.400 align:start position:0%
um participate in a special group
 
01:52:07.990 --> 01:52:08.000 align:start position:0%
would be at all
 
01:52:10.709 --> 01:52:10.719 align:start position:0%
at some point stifled
 
01:52:12.950 --> 01:52:12.960 align:start position:0%
in and unintentionally by what's trying
 
01:52:14.870 --> 01:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
to be accomplished here but that would
 
01:52:16.470 --> 01:52:16.480 align:start position:0%
just be a concern that i would have in
 
01:52:17.990 --> 01:52:18.000 align:start position:0%
the way it's currently written so it
 
01:52:19.589 --> 01:52:19.599 align:start position:0%
might need to be amended to make sure
 
01:52:21.350 --> 01:52:21.360 align:start position:0%
that we don't paint ourselves into a
 
01:52:24.390 --> 01:52:24.400 align:start position:0%
corner would be my concern
 
01:52:29.030 --> 01:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:31.910 --> 01:52:31.920 align:start position:0%
representative klein knight
 
01:52:33.270 --> 01:52:33.280 align:start position:0%
thank you chair
 
01:52:37.430 --> 01:52:37.440 align:start position:0%
um most of this is already law um
 
01:52:40.390 --> 01:52:40.400 align:start position:0%
would a potluck inspire fear or terror
 
01:52:45.350 --> 01:52:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:48.629 --> 01:52:48.639 align:start position:0%
it does state coerce or terrorize so if
 
01:52:51.669 --> 01:52:51.679 align:start position:0%
it coerces someone but gosh i didn't
 
01:52:53.990 --> 01:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
know that we had i know i'm just
 
01:52:55.589 --> 01:52:55.599 align:start position:0%
throwing it out there satanists in our
 
01:52:57.109 --> 01:52:57.119 align:start position:0%
community that are doing a potluck
 
01:52:59.109 --> 01:52:59.119 align:start position:0%
tomorrow afternoon you know what i mean
 
01:53:00.229 --> 01:53:00.239 align:start position:0%
would that
 
01:53:02.390 --> 01:53:02.400 align:start position:0%
you know coerce people to go check that
 
01:53:03.910 --> 01:53:03.920 align:start position:0%
out and with that then it'd be in
 
01:53:06.310 --> 01:53:06.320 align:start position:0%
violation of this i mean i'm just
 
01:53:09.830 --> 01:53:09.840 align:start position:0%
i know that the intent is one thing but
 
01:53:11.350 --> 01:53:11.360 align:start position:0%
i think we have to be very careful when
 
01:53:13.669 --> 01:53:13.679 align:start position:0%
we put things on the books
 
01:53:16.390 --> 01:53:16.400 align:start position:0%
that two three four five years down the
 
01:53:19.830 --> 01:53:19.840 align:start position:0%
road it's all all of a sudden considered
 
01:53:21.510 --> 01:53:21.520 align:start position:0%
that because someone's
 
01:53:25.030 --> 01:53:25.040 align:start position:0%
of a certain faith that maybe
 
01:53:27.030 --> 01:53:27.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't believe in same-sex marriage and
 
01:53:28.950 --> 01:53:28.960 align:start position:0%
that's their right to that religion to
 
01:53:30.310 --> 01:53:30.320 align:start position:0%
that belief
 
01:53:33.830 --> 01:53:33.840 align:start position:0%
is now terrorizing someone who is in a
 
01:53:36.629 --> 01:53:36.639 align:start position:0%
same-sex marriage and feels that that is
 
01:53:37.910 --> 01:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
not something they want to see at the
 
01:53:39.750 --> 01:53:39.760 align:start position:0%
intersection and it just happens to be a
 
01:53:41.990 --> 01:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
catholic church having a potluck so i
 
01:53:44.950 --> 01:53:44.960 align:start position:0%
just think that we've seen things go
 
01:53:47.510 --> 01:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:49.270 --> 01:53:49.280 align:start position:0%
we have laws on the book for littering
 
01:53:51.510 --> 01:53:51.520 align:start position:0%
we have laws on the book for true hate
 
01:53:51.520 --> 01:53:52.550 align:start position:0%
we have laws on the book for true hate
crimes

01:53:52.550 --> 01:53:52.560 align:start position:0%
crimes
 
01:53:54.790 --> 01:53:54.800 align:start position:0%
i think that when we say coerce that's a
 
01:53:57.189 --> 01:53:57.199 align:start position:0%
very loose word
 
01:53:59.750 --> 01:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
and for people to be stifled their
 
01:54:01.510 --> 01:54:01.520 align:start position:0%
freedom of speech
 
01:54:03.350 --> 01:54:03.360 align:start position:0%
whether it be their national origin
 
01:54:05.990 --> 01:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
whether it be their religion
 
01:54:08.070 --> 01:54:08.080 align:start position:0%
it might offend somebody else that i'm a
 
01:54:09.910 --> 01:54:09.920 align:start position:0%
christian it might offend somebody that
 
01:54:12.629 --> 01:54:12.639 align:start position:0%
i'm a republican at some point you know
 
01:54:13.830 --> 01:54:13.840 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:54:15.510 --> 01:54:15.520 align:start position:0%
right so
 
01:54:17.430 --> 01:54:17.440 align:start position:0%
we just want to make sure that we're not
 
01:54:19.030 --> 01:54:19.040 align:start position:0%
putting things on the books that later
 
01:54:21.109 --> 01:54:21.119 align:start position:0%
on could be used to someone hang their
 
01:54:23.189 --> 01:54:23.199 align:start position:0%
hat on i mean heaven forbid you get
 
01:54:25.189 --> 01:54:25.199 align:start position:0%
arrested for saying the word amen as you
 
01:54:26.629 --> 01:54:26.639 align:start position:0%
said quietly you know things are
 
01:54:29.270 --> 01:54:29.280 align:start position:0%
happening that are very alarming to us
 
01:54:30.709 --> 01:54:30.719 align:start position:0%
in the public
 
01:54:30.719 --> 01:54:33.990 align:start position:0%
in the public
poll

01:54:33.990 --> 01:54:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:36.390 --> 01:54:36.400 align:start position:0%
can i be recognized for paul
 
01:54:41.589 --> 01:54:41.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:51.990 --> 01:54:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:53.830 --> 01:54:53.840 align:start position:0%
at this time we will now close the
 
01:54:55.669 --> 01:54:55.679 align:start position:0%
public hearing on
 
01:55:17.830 --> 01:55:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:17.840 --> 01:55:48.310 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:55:48.310 --> 01:55:48.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:48.320 --> 01:55:50.709 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:55:50.709 --> 01:55:50.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:53.270 --> 01:55:53.280 align:start position:0%
at this time we're gonna
 
01:55:55.510 --> 01:55:55.520 align:start position:0%
we'll open the executive session on
 
01:55:57.350 --> 01:55:57.360 align:start position:0%
house bill
 
01:55:57.360 --> 01:55:59.350 align:start position:0%
house bill
1117.

01:55:59.350 --> 01:55:59.360 align:start position:0%
1117.
 
01:56:01.109 --> 01:56:01.119 align:start position:0%
i'm not recognizing any member to make
 
01:56:02.470 --> 01:56:02.480 align:start position:0%
any motion
 
01:56:05.510 --> 01:56:05.520 align:start position:0%
i just open up for discussion
 
01:56:05.520 --> 01:56:10.950 align:start position:0%
i just open up for discussion
and

01:56:10.950 --> 01:56:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:18.950 --> 01:56:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:21.030 --> 01:56:21.040 align:start position:0%
in in what when you're saying that what
 
01:56:22.870 --> 01:56:22.880 align:start position:0%
would if there were to be an amendment
 
01:56:24.709 --> 01:56:24.719 align:start position:0%
you would one be recognized you would
 
01:56:26.149 --> 01:56:26.159 align:start position:0%
have to be recognized for an ought to
 
01:56:44.070 --> 01:56:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:44.080 --> 01:57:00.470 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:57:00.470 --> 01:57:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:01.990 --> 01:57:02.000 align:start position:0%
so what i just
 
01:57:05.750 --> 01:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
my interpretation of what this would do
 
01:57:07.750 --> 01:57:07.760 align:start position:0%
c and d
 
01:57:10.310 --> 01:57:10.320 align:start position:0%
i i don't think i think under existing
 
01:57:10.320 --> 01:57:12.550 align:start position:0%
i i don't think i think under existing
law

01:57:12.550 --> 01:57:12.560 align:start position:0%
law
 
01:57:14.390 --> 01:57:14.400 align:start position:0%
would already cover what the objective
 
01:57:14.400 --> 01:57:15.030 align:start position:0%
would already cover what the objective
is

01:57:15.030 --> 01:57:15.040 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:57:15.040 --> 01:57:16.390 align:start position:0%
is
specifically

01:57:16.390 --> 01:57:16.400 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
01:57:17.669 --> 01:57:17.679 align:start position:0%
you know making a threat to commit a
 
01:57:20.310 --> 01:57:20.320 align:start position:0%
crime against the property of another
 
01:57:22.629 --> 01:57:22.639 align:start position:0%
you you that's you that's someone else's
 
01:57:24.149 --> 01:57:24.159 align:start position:0%
property you're threatening to commit a
 
01:57:25.589 --> 01:57:25.599 align:start position:0%
crime against that
 
01:57:27.830 --> 01:57:27.840 align:start position:0%
to corrosive terrorize the person
 
01:57:35.830 --> 01:57:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:38.470 --> 01:57:38.480 align:start position:0%
means to cause alarm fright or dread
 
01:57:39.830 --> 01:57:39.840 align:start position:0%
state of mind induced by the
 
01:57:41.350 --> 01:57:41.360 align:start position:0%
apprehension of hurt
 
01:57:44.149 --> 01:57:44.159 align:start position:0%
from someone hostile or threatening
 
01:57:46.629 --> 01:57:46.639 align:start position:0%
or threatening event or manifestation
 
01:57:47.990 --> 01:57:48.000 align:start position:0%
so i'm just
 
01:57:49.910 --> 01:57:49.920 align:start position:0%
my interpretation is that c and d would
 
01:57:51.350 --> 01:57:51.360 align:start position:0%
already cover the intent i guess the
 
01:57:52.709 --> 01:57:52.719 align:start position:0%
question really
 
01:57:52.719 --> 01:57:53.510 align:start position:0%
question really
is

01:57:53.510 --> 01:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:57:55.510 --> 01:57:55.520 align:start position:0%
b you're adding public property as
 
01:57:58.870 --> 01:57:58.880 align:start position:0%
opposed to a property of another
 
01:57:59.990 --> 01:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:58:02.550 --> 01:58:02.560 align:start position:0%
the only other question i would pose is
 
01:58:04.470 --> 01:58:04.480 align:start position:0%
would that
 
01:58:08.070 --> 01:58:08.080 align:start position:0%
if that graffiti or was that was a hate
 
01:58:11.189 --> 01:58:11.199 align:start position:0%
message whether it's based on religion
 
01:58:13.189 --> 01:58:13.199 align:start position:0%
race whatever would would that already
 
01:58:14.310 --> 01:58:14.320 align:start position:0%
be covered under the definition of
 
01:58:17.030 --> 01:58:17.040 align:start position:0%
terrorize now i understand what happened
 
01:58:18.709 --> 01:58:18.719 align:start position:0%
in nashua it didn't lead to any
 
01:58:20.390 --> 01:58:20.400 align:start position:0%
prosecution or arrest so that's the
 
01:58:21.990 --> 01:58:22.000 align:start position:0%
concern that
 
01:58:28.149 --> 01:58:28.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:30.229 --> 01:58:30.239 align:start position:0%
representative rhodes
 
01:58:31.990 --> 01:58:32.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:58:34.790 --> 01:58:34.800 align:start position:0%
so when the representative spoke
 
01:58:36.870 --> 01:58:36.880 align:start position:0%
if if i'm not mistaken
 
01:58:39.350 --> 01:58:39.360 align:start position:0%
i do believe that he's that there was a
 
01:58:41.669 --> 01:58:41.679 align:start position:0%
question asked and his answer was
 
01:58:41.679 --> 01:58:43.430 align:start position:0%
question asked and his answer was
that

01:58:43.430 --> 01:58:43.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:58:45.109 --> 01:58:45.119 align:start position:0%
the people were fearful
 
01:58:47.510 --> 01:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
and that about making them uncomfortable
 
01:58:49.669 --> 01:58:49.679 align:start position:0%
and you know was this
 
01:58:51.430 --> 01:58:51.440 align:start position:0%
were they being specifically targeted so
 
01:58:54.310 --> 01:58:54.320 align:start position:0%
he specifically did use the word fear
 
01:58:54.320 --> 01:58:55.510 align:start position:0%
he specifically did use the word fear
and

01:58:55.510 --> 01:58:55.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:58:57.430 --> 01:58:57.440 align:start position:0%
i mean it clearly definitely says that
 
01:58:59.430 --> 01:58:59.440 align:start position:0%
right here under a it
 
01:59:03.030 --> 01:59:03.040 align:start position:0%
attempts to place another in fear
 
01:59:05.830 --> 01:59:05.840 align:start position:0%
another i do believe is meant to be
 
01:59:08.070 --> 01:59:08.080 align:start position:0%
anybody anybody
 
01:59:10.629 --> 01:59:10.639 align:start position:0%
regardless of
 
01:59:13.109 --> 01:59:13.119 align:start position:0%
of who you are or what you look like you
 
01:59:15.430 --> 01:59:15.440 align:start position:0%
are a person
 
01:59:17.350 --> 01:59:17.360 align:start position:0%
i i just don't see what what this bill
 
01:59:23.830 --> 01:59:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:26.390 --> 01:59:26.400 align:start position:0%
i'm also a little i'm a little confused
 
01:59:28.870 --> 01:59:28.880 align:start position:0%
why if the person was not authorized by
 
01:59:30.709 --> 01:59:30.719 align:start position:0%
law to
 
01:59:33.030 --> 01:59:33.040 align:start position:0%
spray paint or make graffiti on the wall
 
01:59:34.550 --> 01:59:34.560 align:start position:0%
but there was nothing done about that
 
01:59:35.750 --> 01:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
that's not a question really we can
 
01:59:37.830 --> 01:59:37.840 align:start position:0%
answer i just i don't
 
01:59:39.830 --> 01:59:39.840 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that that regardless of
 
01:59:41.669 --> 01:59:41.679 align:start position:0%
the intent this this mere act of the
 
01:59:45.270 --> 01:59:45.280 align:start position:0%
graffiti is is a crime
 
01:59:46.870 --> 01:59:46.880 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding we have a bill on
 
01:59:48.790 --> 01:59:48.800 align:start position:0%
that coming up so maybe
 
01:59:53.270 --> 01:59:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:56.070 --> 01:59:56.080 align:start position:0%
representative sullivan um
 
01:59:59.430 --> 01:59:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:04.550 --> 02:00:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:07.830 --> 02:00:07.840 align:start position:0%
the way that it's written now
 
02:00:12.550 --> 02:00:12.560 align:start position:0%
it's specific to terrorizing a person
 
02:00:15.830 --> 02:00:15.840 align:start position:0%
not a class of people but a person
 
02:00:18.390 --> 02:00:18.400 align:start position:0%
so if you put up a piece of graffiti
 
02:00:20.229 --> 02:00:20.239 align:start position:0%
that says
 
02:00:22.390 --> 02:00:22.400 align:start position:0%
kill brian sullivan
 
02:00:24.790 --> 02:00:24.800 align:start position:0%
you're terrorizing me
 
02:00:26.550 --> 02:00:26.560 align:start position:0%
if it's if you put up a piece of
 
02:00:30.390 --> 02:00:30.400 align:start position:0%
graffiti that says kill the gays
 
02:00:30.400 --> 02:00:31.350 align:start position:0%
graffiti that says kill the gays
you're

02:00:31.350 --> 02:00:31.360 align:start position:0%
you're
 
02:00:33.189 --> 02:00:33.199 align:start position:0%
you're terrorizing
 
02:00:34.550 --> 02:00:34.560 align:start position:0%
not a person
 
02:00:36.629 --> 02:00:36.639 align:start position:0%
but a class of people
 
02:00:39.669 --> 02:00:39.679 align:start position:0%
and i think this bill
 
02:00:42.790 --> 02:00:42.800 align:start position:0%
would therefore be helpful to
 
02:00:42.800 --> 02:00:43.669 align:start position:0%
would therefore be helpful to
guide

02:00:43.669 --> 02:00:43.679 align:start position:0%
guide
 
02:00:45.589 --> 02:00:45.599 align:start position:0%
law enforcement to say
 
02:00:47.830 --> 02:00:47.840 align:start position:0%
this is terrorizing a group of people a
 
02:00:51.430 --> 02:00:51.440 align:start position:0%
class of people and it therefore would
 
02:00:55.270 --> 02:00:55.280 align:start position:0%
perhaps result in uh prosecution which
 
02:00:57.510 --> 02:00:57.520 align:start position:0%
as yet hasn't happened in the case that
 
02:01:00.070 --> 02:01:00.080 align:start position:0%
representative speedy have cited
 
02:01:05.270 --> 02:01:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:06.950 --> 02:01:06.960 align:start position:0%
representative klein knight
 
02:01:10.470 --> 02:01:10.480 align:start position:0%
thank you chair um yes uh with
 
02:01:12.950 --> 02:01:12.960 align:start position:0%
uh representative rhodes is correct i
 
02:01:14.390 --> 02:01:14.400 align:start position:0%
believe that this is more of a
 
02:01:16.790 --> 02:01:16.800 align:start position:0%
housekeeping bill we need to amend it
 
02:01:18.310 --> 02:01:18.320 align:start position:0%
and we
 
02:01:23.350 --> 02:01:23.360 align:start position:0%
simply if we add any person or peoples
 
02:01:25.910 --> 02:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
if we click if we correct some grammar
 
02:01:28.229 --> 02:01:28.239 align:start position:0%
we would be cleaning up the entire thing
 
02:01:30.390 --> 02:01:30.400 align:start position:0%
we might not need all this but
 
02:01:32.790 --> 02:01:32.800 align:start position:0%
um if we add a class of people rather
 
02:01:34.709 --> 02:01:34.719 align:start position:0%
than a singular person
 
02:01:37.350 --> 02:01:37.360 align:start position:0%
i think we would be protecting and doing
 
02:01:43.830 --> 02:01:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:46.870 --> 02:01:46.880 align:start position:0%
representative marston
 
02:01:49.510 --> 02:01:49.520 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you mr chairman i have a
 
02:01:52.229 --> 02:01:52.239 align:start position:0%
question of his history of this
 
02:01:54.310 --> 02:01:54.320 align:start position:0%
situation in this case
 
02:01:56.790 --> 02:01:56.800 align:start position:0%
were the police involved do we know and
 
02:01:58.629 --> 02:01:58.639 align:start position:0%
did any action
 
02:02:02.629 --> 02:02:02.639 align:start position:0%
been taken by law enforcement
 
02:02:04.709 --> 02:02:04.719 align:start position:0%
and someone correct me if i'm wrong my
 
02:02:06.629 --> 02:02:06.639 align:start position:0%
understanding that and this was
 
02:02:08.870 --> 02:02:08.880 align:start position:0%
this incident that inspired this bill
 
02:02:11.189 --> 02:02:11.199 align:start position:0%
was covered in the media
 
02:02:12.870 --> 02:02:12.880 align:start position:0%
i so i would presume that the law
 
02:02:15.669 --> 02:02:15.679 align:start position:0%
enforcement is aware of the situation
 
02:02:17.189 --> 02:02:17.199 align:start position:0%
and what i understand is that there was
 
02:02:19.430 --> 02:02:19.440 align:start position:0%
no arrest despite the fact that an
 
02:02:22.790 --> 02:02:22.800 align:start position:0%
organization took credit for
 
02:02:24.229 --> 02:02:24.239 align:start position:0%
what they did
 
02:02:24.239 --> 02:02:26.870 align:start position:0%
what they did
so

02:02:26.870 --> 02:02:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:29.910 --> 02:02:29.920 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm not sure why it was not ending
 
02:02:35.189 --> 02:02:35.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:35.199 --> 02:02:36.709 align:start position:0%
 
representative

02:02:36.709 --> 02:02:36.719 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:02:38.550 --> 02:02:38.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman for letting me
 
02:02:41.030 --> 02:02:41.040 align:start position:0%
speak um my question is about the
 
02:02:42.870 --> 02:02:42.880 align:start position:0%
threats sorry my comments about the
 
02:02:45.270 --> 02:02:45.280 align:start position:0%
threats to groups if it says death to
 
02:02:47.910 --> 02:02:47.920 align:start position:0%
gays would every single person who sees
 
02:02:49.510 --> 02:02:49.520 align:start position:0%
that who fits that description
 
02:02:51.750 --> 02:02:51.760 align:start position:0%
individually already be terrorized by
 
02:02:54.149 --> 02:02:54.159 align:start position:0%
that and have it covered by the statute
 
02:02:56.870 --> 02:02:56.880 align:start position:0%
that's already there and also i question
 
02:02:59.109 --> 02:02:59.119 align:start position:0%
if if this case that was clearly an
 
02:03:00.870 --> 02:03:00.880 align:start position:0%
egregious statement and should have been
 
02:03:03.750 --> 02:03:03.760 align:start position:0%
prosecuted wasn't do we fix it by
 
02:03:05.750 --> 02:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
creating more laws or we try and figure
 
02:03:07.910 --> 02:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
out why this wasn't taken seriously in
 
02:03:14.149 --> 02:03:14.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:17.030 --> 02:03:17.040 align:start position:0%
wallace thank you mr chairman just um
 
02:03:17.910 --> 02:03:17.920 align:start position:0%
one of the
 
02:03:19.990 --> 02:03:20.000 align:start position:0%
stark facts about crime and punishment
 
02:03:21.030 --> 02:03:21.040 align:start position:0%
is the
 
02:03:23.589 --> 02:03:23.599 align:start position:0%
capacity by which
 
02:03:25.830 --> 02:03:25.840 align:start position:0%
these can be dealt with um
 
02:03:27.430 --> 02:03:27.440 align:start position:0%
presently we're
 
02:03:28.470 --> 02:03:28.480 align:start position:0%
seeing some of the unintended
 
02:03:31.270 --> 02:03:31.280 align:start position:0%
consequences of bail reduction bail
 
02:03:34.470 --> 02:03:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:35.990 --> 02:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
reducing a lot of the crimes that we
 
02:03:38.390 --> 02:03:38.400 align:start position:0%
actually prosecute consequently
 
02:03:40.629 --> 02:03:40.639 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of property crimes that
 
02:03:43.030 --> 02:03:43.040 align:start position:0%
are going unprosecuted by deliberate
 
02:03:44.709 --> 02:03:44.719 align:start position:0%
action or lack thereof by county
 
02:03:46.310 --> 02:03:46.320 align:start position:0%
attorneys across all ten counties here
 
02:03:48.149 --> 02:03:48.159 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire they are understaffed
 
02:03:50.069 --> 02:03:50.079 align:start position:0%
and unable to prosecute these types of
 
02:03:52.069 --> 02:03:52.079 align:start position:0%
crimes so unless and until
 
02:03:54.229 --> 02:03:54.239 align:start position:0%
there's actual harm done and although i
 
02:03:56.470 --> 02:03:56.480 align:start position:0%
certainly appreciate the terror that may
 
02:03:56.480 --> 02:03:58.390 align:start position:0%
certainly appreciate the terror that may
be

02:03:58.390 --> 02:03:58.400 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:03:59.830 --> 02:03:59.840 align:start position:0%
instilled or
 
02:04:01.910 --> 02:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
may be caused i don't believe i don't
 
02:04:03.189 --> 02:04:03.199 align:start position:0%
want this to sound harsh that there's
 
02:04:06.310 --> 02:04:06.320 align:start position:0%
any actual harm done here and as such
 
02:04:11.430 --> 02:04:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:13.510 --> 02:04:13.520 align:start position:0%
now this on the committee this this
 
02:04:14.709 --> 02:04:14.719 align:start position:0%
occurred in nashua there's two
 
02:04:16.550 --> 02:04:16.560 align:start position:0%
representatives from nashua did do you
 
02:04:18.229 --> 02:04:18.239 align:start position:0%
have any additional information
 
02:04:20.229 --> 02:04:20.239 align:start position:0%
represent numero representative harry
 
02:04:22.470 --> 02:04:22.480 align:start position:0%
catholic you can provide
 
02:04:22.480 --> 02:04:23.589 align:start position:0%
catholic you can provide
on

02:04:23.589 --> 02:04:23.599 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:04:25.510 --> 02:04:25.520 align:start position:0%
what was done at the local level by law
 
02:04:25.520 --> 02:04:47.350 align:start position:0%
what was done at the local level by law
enforcement

02:04:47.350 --> 02:04:47.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:50.550 --> 02:04:50.560 align:start position:0%
a group claimed attribution
 
02:04:52.310 --> 02:04:52.320 align:start position:0%
but i don't think that that is probably
 
02:04:53.990 --> 02:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
enough evidence to do anything with it
 
02:04:56.550 --> 02:04:56.560 align:start position:0%
so i i assume that there was some reason
 
02:04:59.990 --> 02:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:02.950 --> 02:05:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:04.950 --> 02:05:04.960 align:start position:0%
i'm still baffled i mean this
 
02:05:06.870 --> 02:05:06.880 align:start position:0%
illegal graffiti spray painted on the
 
02:05:06.880 --> 02:05:08.470 align:start position:0%
illegal graffiti spray painted on the
wall

02:05:08.470 --> 02:05:08.480 align:start position:0%
wall
 
02:05:11.669 --> 02:05:11.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:14.069 --> 02:05:14.079 align:start position:0%
that's that's against the law
 
02:05:15.990 --> 02:05:16.000 align:start position:0%
a group owned up to doing it and nothing
 
02:05:18.390 --> 02:05:18.400 align:start position:0%
was done about it i mean i'm just i'm
 
02:05:21.350 --> 02:05:21.360 align:start position:0%
just i'm not even this bill aside i find
 
02:05:22.870 --> 02:05:22.880 align:start position:0%
that hard i'm just wondering that's what
 
02:05:25.350 --> 02:05:25.360 align:start position:0%
happened i'm just wondering
 
02:05:27.350 --> 02:05:27.360 align:start position:0%
i'm not a lawyer but i'm just wondering
 
02:05:27.360 --> 02:05:28.870 align:start position:0%
i'm not a lawyer but i'm just wondering
if

02:05:28.870 --> 02:05:28.880 align:start position:0%
if
 
02:05:33.669 --> 02:05:33.679 align:start position:0%
uh the nashua police department could
 
02:05:34.870 --> 02:05:34.880 align:start position:0%
could um
 
02:05:37.830 --> 02:05:37.840 align:start position:0%
prosecute the hate group
 
02:05:41.270 --> 02:05:41.280 align:start position:0%
that um took attribution for it or who
 
02:05:43.589 --> 02:05:43.599 align:start position:0%
was it that that how did they do it did
 
02:05:45.109 --> 02:05:45.119 align:start position:0%
they just write a statement that we did
 
02:05:47.270 --> 02:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
it or whatever i'm just i would think
 
02:05:48.470 --> 02:05:48.480 align:start position:0%
that that would be a difficult
 
02:05:52.550 --> 02:05:52.560 align:start position:0%
prosecution if they even could do that
 
02:05:52.560 --> 02:05:53.430 align:start position:0%
prosecution if they even could do that
it's

02:05:53.430 --> 02:05:53.440 align:start position:0%
it's
 
02:05:55.430 --> 02:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
my my humble opinions it's easy to
 
02:05:57.669 --> 02:05:57.679 align:start position:0%
prosecute a crime when they admit to
 
02:05:59.910 --> 02:05:59.920 align:start position:0%
admit to it but i see the point that
 
02:06:01.270 --> 02:06:01.280 align:start position:0%
you're making that the org you can't
 
02:06:03.189 --> 02:06:03.199 align:start position:0%
prosecute an organization but if you
 
02:06:09.750 --> 02:06:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:15.430 --> 02:06:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:17.669 --> 02:06:17.679 align:start position:0%
since we're executing this now and not
 
02:06:19.669 --> 02:06:19.679 align:start position:0%
um after we can research i've been
 
02:06:21.510 --> 02:06:21.520 align:start position:0%
researching during the
 
02:06:25.189 --> 02:06:25.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:25.199 --> 02:06:26.069 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:06:26.069 --> 02:06:26.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:29.189 --> 02:06:29.199 align:start position:0%
it looks like in nashua
 
02:06:30.790 --> 02:06:30.800 align:start position:0%
there was a man in nashua who spray
 
02:06:33.109 --> 02:06:33.119 align:start position:0%
painted some
 
02:06:35.030 --> 02:06:35.040 align:start position:0%
swastikas in concord
 
02:06:39.189 --> 02:06:39.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:40.790 --> 02:06:40.800 align:start position:0%
criminal mischief
 
02:06:40.800 --> 02:06:41.990 align:start position:0%
criminal mischief
and

02:06:41.990 --> 02:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:06:44.069 --> 02:06:44.079 align:start position:0%
not criminal threatening and the
 
02:06:46.149 --> 02:06:46.159 align:start position:0%
swastikas were spray-painted like on or
 
02:06:46.159 --> 02:06:47.270 align:start position:0%
swastikas were spray-painted like on or
near

02:06:47.270 --> 02:06:47.280 align:start position:0%
near
 
02:06:48.870 --> 02:06:48.880 align:start position:0%
the home of a
 
02:06:48.880 --> 02:06:50.229 align:start position:0%
the home of a
person

02:06:50.229 --> 02:06:50.239 align:start position:0%
person
 
02:06:53.430 --> 02:06:53.440 align:start position:0%
who's a new american so like a refugee
 
02:06:55.430 --> 02:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
um so that's definitely
 
02:06:56.950 --> 02:06:56.960 align:start position:0%
about their
 
02:06:56.960 --> 02:06:58.709 align:start position:0%
about their
origin

02:06:58.709 --> 02:06:58.719 align:start position:0%
origin
 
02:06:58.719 --> 02:06:59.990 align:start position:0%
origin
and

02:06:59.990 --> 02:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:07:02.229 --> 02:07:02.239 align:start position:0%
their entry into the country
 
02:07:03.510 --> 02:07:03.520 align:start position:0%
and he was charged with criminal
 
02:07:03.520 --> 02:07:04.870 align:start position:0%
and he was charged with criminal
mischief

02:07:04.870 --> 02:07:04.880 align:start position:0%
mischief
 
02:07:06.790 --> 02:07:06.800 align:start position:0%
there was a teenager
 
02:07:08.629 --> 02:07:08.639 align:start position:0%
in manchester who was spray painting
 
02:07:10.390 --> 02:07:10.400 align:start position:0%
swastikas on things he was charged with
 
02:07:12.470 --> 02:07:12.480 align:start position:0%
criminal mischief
 
02:07:12.480 --> 02:07:13.430 align:start position:0%
criminal mischief
and

02:07:13.430 --> 02:07:13.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:07:15.430 --> 02:07:15.440 align:start position:0%
then there were a couple of
 
02:07:17.270 --> 02:07:17.280 align:start position:0%
men who were spray painting their
 
02:07:17.280 --> 02:07:18.709 align:start position:0%
men who were spray painting their
initials

02:07:18.709 --> 02:07:18.719 align:start position:0%
initials
 
02:07:20.629 --> 02:07:20.639 align:start position:0%
all over the city in manchester and the
 
02:07:20.639 --> 02:07:21.910 align:start position:0%
all over the city in manchester and the
highways

02:07:21.910 --> 02:07:21.920 align:start position:0%
highways
 
02:07:23.270 --> 02:07:23.280 align:start position:0%
and they were charged with criminal
 
02:07:26.149 --> 02:07:26.159 align:start position:0%
mischief so it seems that and this is in
 
02:07:29.430 --> 02:07:29.440 align:start position:0%
the last five for six years
 
02:07:29.440 --> 02:07:30.550 align:start position:0%
the last five for six years
um

02:07:30.550 --> 02:07:30.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:07:32.390 --> 02:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
so it does seem like
 
02:07:34.390 --> 02:07:34.400 align:start position:0%
the application of the law currently is
 
02:07:36.470 --> 02:07:36.480 align:start position:0%
that regardless of whether what you're
 
02:07:38.709 --> 02:07:38.719 align:start position:0%
spray painting or graffiti
 
02:07:40.550 --> 02:07:40.560 align:start position:0%
is intended to
 
02:07:43.430 --> 02:07:43.440 align:start position:0%
terrorize someone or whether you're just
 
02:07:46.069 --> 02:07:46.079 align:start position:0%
claiming a portion of the retaining wall
 
02:07:48.629 --> 02:07:48.639 align:start position:0%
on the side of the highway for yourself
 
02:07:50.229 --> 02:07:50.239 align:start position:0%
and putting your initials on it it's
 
02:07:51.669 --> 02:07:51.679 align:start position:0%
treated the same
 
02:07:54.550 --> 02:07:54.560 align:start position:0%
and that doesn't seem appropriate given
 
02:07:57.669 --> 02:07:57.679 align:start position:0%
the intent behind the use of swastikas
 
02:07:59.109 --> 02:07:59.119 align:start position:0%
for example
 
02:08:02.069 --> 02:08:02.079 align:start position:0%
so i just wanted to share that
 
02:08:03.189 --> 02:08:03.199 align:start position:0%
so at
 
02:08:05.669 --> 02:08:05.679 align:start position:0%
just a thought at 11 15 there's a bill
 
02:08:07.430 --> 02:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
schedule that is actually
 
02:08:09.830 --> 02:08:09.840 align:start position:0%
would address criminal mischief so maybe
 
02:08:11.669 --> 02:08:11.679 align:start position:0%
it would make sense for us to
 
02:08:11.679 --> 02:08:12.550 align:start position:0%
it would make sense for us to
well

02:08:12.550 --> 02:08:12.560 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:08:12.560 --> 02:08:14.310 align:start position:0%
well
just

02:08:14.310 --> 02:08:14.320 align:start position:0%
just
 
02:08:15.910 --> 02:08:15.920 align:start position:0%
finish the sentence
 
02:08:18.229 --> 02:08:18.239 align:start position:0%
perhaps we can
 
02:08:20.470 --> 02:08:20.480 align:start position:0%
we can um
 
02:08:22.550 --> 02:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
recess the executive session and maybe
 
02:08:24.390 --> 02:08:24.400 align:start position:0%
hear testimony on the criminal mission
 
02:08:26.790 --> 02:08:26.800 align:start position:0%
film maybe come back to this
 
02:08:28.629 --> 02:08:28.639 align:start position:0%

district 13.
 
02:18:02.230 --> 02:18:02.240 align:start position:0%
and this bill is one that we heard
 
02:18:03.589 --> 02:18:03.599 align:start position:0%
last year
 
02:18:06.790 --> 02:18:06.800 align:start position:0%
as part of a senate omnibus bill
 
02:18:08.709 --> 02:18:08.719 align:start position:0%
so this is a
 
02:18:11.270 --> 02:18:11.280 align:start position:0%
another try
 
02:18:14.070 --> 02:18:14.080 align:start position:0%
this would make uh
 
02:18:17.030 --> 02:18:17.040 align:start position:0%
criminal mischief a class a misdemeanor
 
02:18:18.549 --> 02:18:18.559 align:start position:0%
which means there could be
 
02:18:20.790 --> 02:18:20.800 align:start position:0%
charges of class a misdemeanor depending
 
02:18:23.110 --> 02:18:23.120 align:start position:0%
on the type of
 
02:18:23.120 --> 02:18:23.990 align:start position:0%
on the type of
crime crime

02:18:23.990 --> 02:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
crime crime
 
02:18:25.589 --> 02:18:25.599 align:start position:0%
was or could be
 
02:18:25.599 --> 02:18:27.110 align:start position:0%
was or could be
down

02:18:27.110 --> 02:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
down
 
02:18:32.629 --> 02:18:32.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:35.750 --> 02:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
this was brought to my attention uh last
 
02:18:35.760 --> 02:18:36.790 align:start position:0%
this was brought to my attention uh last
year

02:18:36.790 --> 02:18:36.800 align:start position:0%
year

and uh we have
 
02:18:46.469 --> 02:18:46.479 align:start position:0%
had to pay some considerable sums
 
02:18:48.230 --> 02:18:48.240 align:start position:0%
on public property and it has been
 
02:18:50.469 --> 02:18:50.479 align:start position:0%
defaced and tampered with
 
02:18:53.190 --> 02:18:53.200 align:start position:0%
and i think that this is a a good bill
 
02:18:53.200 --> 02:18:54.070 align:start position:0%
and i think that this is a a good bill
and

02:18:54.070 --> 02:18:54.080 align:start position:0%

called me out of the blue and he
 
02:19:05.589 --> 02:19:05.599 align:start position:0%
supports this bill so
 
02:19:08.389 --> 02:19:08.399 align:start position:0%
take that for what it's worth
 
02:19:19.270 --> 02:19:19.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:29.030 --> 02:19:29.040 align:start position:0%

02:19:48.309 --> 02:19:48.319 align:start position:0%
the gcnh ourselves the general court das
 
02:19:50.150 --> 02:19:50.160 align:start position:0%
we were having some troubles on the
 
02:19:52.389 --> 02:19:52.399 align:start position:0%
front state house plaza
 
02:19:54.950 --> 02:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
and we really weren't at all able to
 
02:19:56.790 --> 02:19:56.800 align:start position:0%
charge anybody with anything prior to
 
02:19:58.389 --> 02:19:58.399 align:start position:0%
the last year's legislation getting
 
02:20:00.550 --> 02:20:00.560 align:start position:0%
passed as representative welch indicated
 
02:20:03.190 --> 02:20:03.200 align:start position:0%
with that omnibus bill so that made at
 
02:20:05.510 --> 02:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
least a violation so we could go up the
 
02:20:07.190 --> 02:20:07.200 align:start position:0%
original draft of this was from the
 
02:20:09.270 --> 02:20:09.280 align:start position:0%
department of justice the ag's office
 
02:20:10.870 --> 02:20:10.880 align:start position:0%
who wanted it as a misdemeanor because
 
02:20:11.990 --> 02:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
you can always go down from a
 
02:20:13.750 --> 02:20:13.760 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor as you know but you can't go
 
02:20:16.070 --> 02:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
up from a violation so in some of the
 
02:20:19.030 --> 02:20:19.040 align:start position:0%
severity of of some of the defacements
 
02:20:21.030 --> 02:20:21.040 align:start position:0%
and even things that are happening today
 
02:20:22.710 --> 02:20:22.720 align:start position:0%
we're in a kind of a different political
 
02:20:25.270 --> 02:20:25.280 align:start position:0%
profile so folks that advocate or
 
02:20:27.030 --> 02:20:27.040 align:start position:0%
protest for different things out there
 
02:20:27.040 --> 02:20:27.910 align:start position:0%
protest for different things out there
seem

02:20:27.910 --> 02:20:27.920 align:start position:0%
seem
 
02:20:30.389 --> 02:20:30.399 align:start position:0%
to get a little more um on edge and a
 
02:20:31.830 --> 02:20:31.840 align:start position:0%
little more violent especially with some
 
02:20:33.429 --> 02:20:33.439 align:start position:0%
of the public properties
 
02:20:36.550 --> 02:20:36.560 align:start position:0%
so the the defacement has gotten to be a
 
02:20:38.389 --> 02:20:38.399 align:start position:0%
point where it can
 
02:20:39.990 --> 02:20:40.000 align:start position:0%
really should raise to a misdemeanor
 
02:20:41.750 --> 02:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
level in my opinion and an opinion of
 
02:20:43.349 --> 02:20:43.359 align:start position:0%
the department of justice at least have
 
02:20:45.270 --> 02:20:45.280 align:start position:0%
that chargeability so that they can
 
02:20:46.790 --> 02:20:46.800 align:start position:0%
bring it down if they have to in a
 
02:20:48.710 --> 02:20:48.720 align:start position:0%
bargain plea bargain or something
 
02:20:49.910 --> 02:20:49.920 align:start position:0%
so that's a little of the history of
 
02:20:51.990 --> 02:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
where it came from and we still
 
02:20:53.590 --> 02:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
have certain
 
02:20:55.349 --> 02:20:55.359 align:start position:0%
issues out there i won't say they're
 
02:20:57.030 --> 02:20:57.040 align:start position:0%
problems they're challenges because the
 
02:20:59.590 --> 02:20:59.600 align:start position:0%
state house plaza is the is this town
 
02:21:02.550 --> 02:21:02.560 align:start position:0%
square for for the state so it's there
 
02:21:03.990 --> 02:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
it's a place where people exercise the
 
02:21:05.910 --> 02:21:05.920 align:start position:0%
first amendment rights we want them to
 
02:21:08.710 --> 02:21:08.720 align:start position:0%
we encourage them to do that out there
 
02:21:11.110 --> 02:21:11.120 align:start position:0%
as a body and as an institution
 
02:21:12.950 --> 02:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
but we wanted to do it peacefully and
 
02:21:15.349 --> 02:21:15.359 align:start position:0%
without damaging
 
02:21:17.030 --> 02:21:17.040 align:start position:0%
the property that's out there that
 
02:21:18.950 --> 02:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
everybody can enjoy
 
02:21:20.309 --> 02:21:20.319 align:start position:0%
for instance we have things that happen
 
02:21:21.590 --> 02:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
out there that you wouldn't want your
 
02:21:23.110 --> 02:21:23.120 align:start position:0%
fourth graders walking by the next
 
02:21:24.469 --> 02:21:24.479 align:start position:0%
morning when they're coming in to take a
 
02:21:24.479 --> 02:21:25.270 align:start position:0%
morning when they're coming in to take a
tour

02:21:25.270 --> 02:21:25.280 align:start position:0%
tour
 
02:21:26.790 --> 02:21:26.800 align:start position:0%
so these things
 
02:21:28.790 --> 02:21:28.800 align:start position:0%
it could prove to be a deterrent that's
 
02:21:30.469 --> 02:21:30.479 align:start position:0%
what the goal is of this is that if it's
 
02:21:32.710 --> 02:21:32.720 align:start position:0%
a violation it's a ticket if it's a
 
02:21:33.990 --> 02:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor it's something a little more
 
02:21:36.309 --> 02:21:36.319 align:start position:0%
substantial and it may
 
02:21:38.309 --> 02:21:38.319 align:start position:0%
create a deterrent as is what we really
 
02:21:40.389 --> 02:21:40.399 align:start position:0%
want nothing to happen but their active
 
02:21:41.670 --> 02:21:41.680 align:start position:0%
ability to exercise their first
 
02:21:42.870 --> 02:21:42.880 align:start position:0%
amendment rights
 
02:21:44.309 --> 02:21:44.319 align:start position:0%
so with that i'll
 
02:21:45.990 --> 02:21:46.000 align:start position:0%
take any questions mr chairman members
 
02:21:54.309 --> 02:21:54.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:56.070 --> 02:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
with that thank you very much appreciate
 
02:22:12.630 --> 02:22:12.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:14.870 --> 02:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
representative welch i may ask inquire
 
02:22:17.670 --> 02:22:17.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:21.510 --> 02:22:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:23.830 --> 02:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
so it's it's a class a misdemeanor the
 
02:22:25.349 --> 02:22:25.359 align:start position:0%
prior witness
 
02:22:25.359 --> 02:22:26.230 align:start position:0%
prior witness
mentioned

02:22:26.230 --> 02:22:26.240 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
02:22:28.150 --> 02:22:28.160 align:start position:0%
pleading it down
 
02:22:28.160 --> 02:22:29.270 align:start position:0%
pleading it down
which

02:22:29.270 --> 02:22:29.280 align:start position:0%
which
 
02:22:31.110 --> 02:22:31.120 align:start position:0%
i i understand
 
02:22:34.550 --> 02:22:34.560 align:start position:0%
you know how that could work but it
 
02:22:36.469 --> 02:22:36.479 align:start position:0%
any thought on if it just said
 
02:22:38.469 --> 02:22:38.479 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor so it can be charged as an a
 
02:22:39.670 --> 02:22:39.680 align:start position:0%
or b
 
02:22:41.349 --> 02:22:41.359 align:start position:0%
and obviously if it's an a it can be
 
02:22:43.510 --> 02:22:43.520 align:start position:0%
played down to a b
 
02:22:44.710 --> 02:22:44.720 align:start position:0%
is that
 
02:22:46.550 --> 02:22:46.560 align:start position:0%
an amendment that you perhaps
 
02:22:48.309 --> 02:22:48.319 align:start position:0%
have any opinion on
 
02:22:50.469 --> 02:22:50.479 align:start position:0%
my understanding is it
 
02:22:52.550 --> 02:22:52.560 align:start position:0%
as a class a misdemeanor it can be
 
02:22:55.349 --> 02:22:55.359 align:start position:0%
charged as a class b or
 
02:22:55.359 --> 02:22:56.389 align:start position:0%
charged as a class b or
uh

02:22:56.389 --> 02:22:56.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:22:57.830 --> 02:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
or violation
 
02:22:59.670 --> 02:22:59.680 align:start position:0%
all depends on the crime
 
02:23:01.510 --> 02:23:01.520 align:start position:0%
i always understood it and someone
 
02:23:03.030 --> 02:23:03.040 align:start position:0%
correct me if i'm wrong i
 
02:23:05.429 --> 02:23:05.439 align:start position:0%
act like i'm always right but i'm not
 
02:23:07.910 --> 02:23:07.920 align:start position:0%
if it says just misdemeanor that gives
 
02:23:10.630 --> 02:23:10.640 align:start position:0%
the discretion to pick an a or a b if
 
02:23:13.510 --> 02:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
it's expressly states a or expressly
 
02:23:14.790 --> 02:23:14.800 align:start position:0%
states b
 
02:23:17.830 --> 02:23:17.840 align:start position:0%
then that's what it's charged as so
 
02:23:19.670 --> 02:23:19.680 align:start position:0%
was going to say if it just said
 
02:23:21.990 --> 02:23:22.000 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor there will be the discretion
 
02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:23.030 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor there will be the discretion
to

02:23:23.030 --> 02:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:23:24.469 --> 02:23:24.479 align:start position:0%
start with an a
 
02:23:27.590 --> 02:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
ple down to a b but if it's already
 
02:23:30.309 --> 02:23:30.319 align:start position:0%
you can't go up but you can go down
 
02:23:32.389 --> 02:23:32.399 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure you can plead this down to
 
02:23:34.389 --> 02:23:34.399 align:start position:0%
a violation because it says shall be
 
02:23:35.910 --> 02:23:35.920 align:start position:0%
guilty of
 
02:23:37.030 --> 02:23:37.040 align:start position:0%
class a misdemeanor you would have to
 
02:23:38.870 --> 02:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
amend the charge
 
02:23:40.870 --> 02:23:40.880 align:start position:0%
to something different which does does
 
02:23:43.110 --> 02:23:43.120 align:start position:0%
happen but that's
 
02:23:45.190 --> 02:23:45.200 align:start position:0%
this has a restitution figure in there
 
02:23:47.270 --> 02:23:47.280 align:start position:0%
as well so you may lose that by amending
 
02:23:48.870 --> 02:23:48.880 align:start position:0%
the charge
 
02:23:51.110 --> 02:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
i agree with that as you generally
 
02:23:53.429 --> 02:23:53.439 align:start position:0%
described it
 
02:23:53.439 --> 02:23:54.150 align:start position:0%
described it
so

02:23:54.150 --> 02:23:54.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:23:55.590 --> 02:23:55.600 align:start position:0%
i think
 
02:23:57.429 --> 02:23:57.439 align:start position:0%
my impression is that if you say
 
02:24:00.710 --> 02:24:00.720 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor you could do a or b
 
02:24:01.910 --> 02:24:01.920 align:start position:0%
i don't know if you could go from
 
02:24:05.510 --> 02:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor down to to a violation
 
02:24:07.670 --> 02:24:07.680 align:start position:0%
but i think that would at least give you
 
02:24:09.510 --> 02:24:09.520 align:start position:0%
the discretion if you said misdemeanor
 
02:24:11.190 --> 02:24:11.200 align:start position:0%
that it could be charged as a
 
02:24:13.190 --> 02:24:13.200 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor where in this case it has to
 
02:24:15.270 --> 02:24:15.280 align:start position:0%
be charged as a class a
 
02:24:18.630 --> 02:24:18.640 align:start position:0%
that's just how i think about that
 
02:24:21.190 --> 02:24:21.200 align:start position:0%
does the prime sponsor have any
 
02:24:23.190 --> 02:24:23.200 align:start position:0%
opinion on that
 
02:24:25.910 --> 02:24:25.920 align:start position:0%
i also support it as written i i don't
 
02:24:27.030 --> 02:24:27.040 align:start position:0%
have a problem with
 
02:24:28.710 --> 02:24:28.720 align:start position:0%
how it's written i just throw it out
 
02:24:30.150 --> 02:24:30.160 align:start position:0%
yeah i guess
 
02:24:32.150 --> 02:24:32.160 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i would
 
02:24:34.389 --> 02:24:34.399 align:start position:0%
rely on the fact that the a.g
 
02:24:36.630 --> 02:24:36.640 align:start position:0%
crafted the uh
 
02:24:49.429 --> 02:24:49.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:51.270 --> 02:24:51.280 align:start position:0%
to testify again
 
02:24:54.389 --> 02:24:54.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:56.710 --> 02:24:56.720 align:start position:0%
uh thank you uh mr chairman and thank
 
02:24:58.950 --> 02:24:58.960 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony
 
02:24:58.960 --> 02:25:01.830 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony
um

02:25:01.830 --> 02:25:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:03.990 --> 02:25:04.000 align:start position:0%
i guess what i would like to see more
 
02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:04.870 align:start position:0%
i guess what i would like to see more
too

02:25:04.870 --> 02:25:04.880 align:start position:0%
too
 
02:25:06.150 --> 02:25:06.160 align:start position:0%
you know which i don't know how you can
 
02:25:08.950 --> 02:25:08.960 align:start position:0%
do this you know but be more specific on
 
02:25:08.960 --> 02:25:10.389 align:start position:0%
do this you know but be more specific on
what

02:25:10.389 --> 02:25:10.399 align:start position:0%
what
 
02:25:14.230 --> 02:25:14.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:17.270 --> 02:25:17.280 align:start position:0%
but i also would support the bill more
 
02:25:20.950 --> 02:25:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:20.960 --> 02:25:23.110 align:start position:0%
 
basically

02:25:23.110 --> 02:25:23.120 align:start position:0%
basically
 
02:25:24.950 --> 02:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
for public property this is what
 
02:25:27.190 --> 02:25:27.200 align:start position:0%
instituted the change
 
02:25:27.200 --> 02:25:29.590 align:start position:0%
instituted the change
um

02:25:29.590 --> 02:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:32.469 --> 02:25:32.479 align:start position:0%
i don't want to reference january 6 in
 
02:25:34.469 --> 02:25:34.479 align:start position:0%
washington but it could have happened
 
02:25:36.790 --> 02:25:36.800 align:start position:0%
here and all the destruction and so
 
02:25:38.630 --> 02:25:38.640 align:start position:0%
forth it seems kind of foolish that if
 
02:25:41.349 --> 02:25:41.359 align:start position:0%
we only had a violation
 
02:25:43.190 --> 02:25:43.200 align:start position:0%
to cover that destruction of property
 
02:25:50.870 --> 02:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:52.070 --> 02:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
representative parent catholic you
 
02:26:12.870 --> 02:26:12.880 align:start position:0%

um

02:26:20.550 --> 02:26:20.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:23.349 --> 02:26:23.359 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't uh believe that i think
 
02:26:26.550 --> 02:26:26.560 align:start position:0%
the the class a misdemeanor would cover
 
02:26:26.560 --> 02:26:27.750 align:start position:0%
the the class a misdemeanor would cover
uh

02:26:27.750 --> 02:26:27.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:26:30.309 --> 02:26:30.319 align:start position:0%
the more violent uh
 
02:26:31.910 --> 02:26:31.920 align:start position:0%
things that can happen
 
02:26:34.950 --> 02:26:34.960 align:start position:0%
uh it can certainly be uh
 
02:26:37.349 --> 02:26:37.359 align:start position:0%
brought down to a class b
 
02:26:38.630 --> 02:26:38.640 align:start position:0%
and it can be brought down to a
 
02:26:40.790 --> 02:26:40.800 align:start position:0%
violation all depends on on the plea
 
02:26:42.309 --> 02:26:42.319 align:start position:0%
bargain it won't have a plea bargain but
 
02:26:43.830 --> 02:26:43.840 align:start position:0%
it's a violation
 
02:26:46.389 --> 02:26:46.399 align:start position:0%
and the warby won't be any restitution
 
02:26:46.399 --> 02:26:47.510 align:start position:0%
and the warby won't be any restitution
that's

02:26:47.510 --> 02:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
that's
 
02:26:51.030 --> 02:26:51.040 align:start position:0%
that's what happened uh we had some uh
 
02:26:52.630 --> 02:26:52.640 align:start position:0%
some destruction out in the front of the
 
02:26:55.190 --> 02:26:55.200 align:start position:0%
state house and it was very costly to
 
02:26:55.200 --> 02:26:56.630 align:start position:0%
state house and it was very costly to
repair

02:26:56.630 --> 02:26:56.640 align:start position:0%
repair
 
02:26:59.110 --> 02:26:59.120 align:start position:0%

02:27:01.270 --> 02:27:01.280 align:start position:0%
spent a few thousand dollars to replace
 
02:27:01.280 --> 02:27:02.790 align:start position:0%
spent a few thousand dollars to replace
that

02:27:02.790 --> 02:27:02.800 align:start position:0%

originally opposed to this bill because
 
02:34:22.240 --> 02:34:22.950 align:start position:0%
originally opposed to this bill because
it

02:34:22.950 --> 02:34:22.960 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:34:26.150 --> 02:34:26.160 align:start position:0%
required a class to be a class a
 
02:34:26.160 --> 02:34:27.670 align:start position:0%
required a class to be a class a
misdemeanor

02:34:27.670 --> 02:34:27.680 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor
 
02:34:29.110 --> 02:34:29.120 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:34:35.510 --> 02:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:37.030 --> 02:34:37.040 align:start position:0%
any offense
 
02:34:39.750 --> 02:34:39.760 align:start position:0%
charged as a class a misdemeanor to like
 
02:34:42.389 --> 02:34:42.399 align:start position:0%
class b misdemeanor anytime with the
 
02:34:44.389 --> 02:34:44.399 align:start position:0%
agreement of the person charged
 
02:34:44.399 --> 02:34:46.630 align:start position:0%
agreement of the person charged
so

02:34:46.630 --> 02:34:46.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:34:49.349 --> 02:34:49.359 align:start position:0%
though it may be a reason maybe charge
 
02:34:49.359 --> 02:34:50.150 align:start position:0%
though it may be a reason maybe charge
class

02:34:50.150 --> 02:34:50.160 align:start position:0%
class
 
02:34:53.349 --> 02:34:53.359 align:start position:0%
egg misdemeanor uh the parties involved
 
02:34:56.070 --> 02:34:56.080 align:start position:0%
can plead it down to a
 
02:34:59.190 --> 02:34:59.200 align:start position:0%
class b and class b misdemeanor
 
02:35:05.750 --> 02:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:07.510 --> 02:35:07.520 align:start position:0%
so based on
 
02:35:10.550 --> 02:35:10.560 align:start position:0%
the severity of the crime
 
02:35:14.790 --> 02:35:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:17.349 --> 02:35:17.359 align:start position:0%
representative conley
 
02:35:18.870 --> 02:35:18.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman what i like about
 
02:35:20.710 --> 02:35:20.720 align:start position:0%
this bill and i intend to support it is
 
02:35:23.429 --> 02:35:23.439 align:start position:0%
that it offers some teeth particularly
 
02:35:25.110 --> 02:35:25.120 align:start position:0%
for cases of
 
02:35:25.120 --> 02:35:26.550 align:start position:0%
for cases of
vandalism

02:35:26.550 --> 02:35:26.560 align:start position:0%
vandalism
 
02:35:29.830 --> 02:35:29.840 align:start position:0%
and as we heard from two bills ago
 
02:35:31.190 --> 02:35:31.200 align:start position:0%
there seemed to be some problems
 
02:35:34.070 --> 02:35:34.080 align:start position:0%
addressing it i believe up to a year in
 
02:35:34.080 --> 02:35:35.190 align:start position:0%
addressing it i believe up to a year in
jail

02:35:35.190 --> 02:35:35.200 align:start position:0%
jail
 
02:35:38.469 --> 02:35:38.479 align:start position:0%
is a pretty uh substantial
 
02:35:40.950 --> 02:35:40.960 align:start position:0%
penalty and it offers an enhancement
 
02:35:42.550 --> 02:35:42.560 align:start position:0%
under the current law to address the
 
02:35:44.150 --> 02:35:44.160 align:start position:0%
situation we heard two bills ago so i
 
02:35:48.309 --> 02:35:48.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:50.389 --> 02:35:50.399 align:start position:0%
representative burke
 
02:35:52.830 --> 02:35:52.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
02:35:55.429 --> 02:35:55.439 align:start position:0%
um again i wished it was just a
 
02:35:55.439 --> 02:35:56.950 align:start position:0%
um again i wished it was just a
misdemeanor

02:35:56.950 --> 02:35:56.960 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor
 
02:35:56.960 --> 02:35:58.070 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor
but

02:35:58.070 --> 02:35:58.080 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:36:00.790 --> 02:36:00.800 align:start position:0%
where i guess my concern is
 
02:36:03.270 --> 02:36:03.280 align:start position:0%
and i really believe the majority of our
 
02:36:05.750 --> 02:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
police would not do this
 
02:36:08.710 --> 02:36:08.720 align:start position:0%
um but you get some kid
 
02:36:11.349 --> 02:36:11.359 align:start position:0%
you know 18 19
 
02:36:13.270 --> 02:36:13.280 align:start position:0%
and he chocks
 
02:36:14.469 --> 02:36:14.479 align:start position:0%
the front of the state house or
 
02:36:17.270 --> 02:36:17.280 align:start position:0%
something like that it's not permanent
 
02:36:20.230 --> 02:36:20.240 align:start position:0%
but he could still be charged
 
02:36:22.389 --> 02:36:22.399 align:start position:0%
and what concerns me is you know there
 
02:36:23.910 --> 02:36:23.920 align:start position:0%
goes this college and everything else
 
02:36:25.750 --> 02:36:25.760 align:start position:0%
because the charge is there
 
02:36:27.750 --> 02:36:27.760 align:start position:0%
so i guess i just have to look at that
 
02:36:27.760 --> 02:36:28.630 align:start position:0%
so i guess i just have to look at that
um

02:36:28.630 --> 02:36:28.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:36:30.550 --> 02:36:30.560 align:start position:0%

bill to a point um but again i just wish
 
02:36:42.150 --> 02:36:42.160 align:start position:0%
it was a misdemeanor
 
02:36:44.710 --> 02:36:44.720 align:start position:0%
which would make me a little easier
 
02:36:44.720 --> 02:36:45.590 align:start position:0%
which would make me a little easier
but

02:36:45.590 --> 02:36:45.600 align:start position:0%

a majority report
 
02:39:13.110 --> 02:39:13.120 align:start position:0%
this at this time we'll now close the
 
02:39:16.550 --> 02:39:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:19.990 --> 02:39:20.000 align:start position:0%
on house bill 1011

02:39:39.349 --> 02:39:39.359 align:start position:0%
my understanding every committee has
 
02:39:40.870 --> 02:39:40.880 align:start position:0%
their reports and before the end of the
 
02:39:40.880 --> 02:39:41.990 align:start position:0%
their reports and before the end of the
day

02:39:41.990 --> 02:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
day
 
02:39:43.830 --> 02:39:43.840 align:start position:0%
i am a little more lenient it has to be
 
02:39:45.110 --> 02:39:45.120 align:start position:0%
by noontime
 
02:39:46.710 --> 02:39:46.720 align:start position:0%
the following day because sometimes
 
02:39:47.910 --> 02:39:47.920 align:start position:0%
we're here late
 
02:39:50.469 --> 02:39:50.479 align:start position:0%
but if it's not received by then i spent
 
02:39:52.870 --> 02:39:52.880 align:start position:0%
more time tracking down reports
 
02:39:55.190 --> 02:39:55.200 align:start position:0%
i i understand that and i understand
 
02:39:57.270 --> 02:39:57.280 align:start position:0%
that and if it's not in by that time and
 
02:39:58.230 --> 02:39:58.240 align:start position:0%
you haven't
 
02:39:59.910 --> 02:39:59.920 align:start position:0%
discussed it with me in advance it's
 
02:40:01.030 --> 02:40:01.040 align:start position:0%
going to be rejected and you'll have to
 
02:40:02.230 --> 02:40:02.240 align:start position:0%
take it up with the speaker's office
 
02:40:04.389 --> 02:40:04.399 align:start position:0%
thank you a lot of time goes it goes
 
02:40:17.670 --> 02:40:17.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:20.150 --> 02:40:20.160 align:start position:0%
at this time we will now open the
 
02:40:28.950 --> 02:40:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:30.710 --> 02:40:30.720 align:start position:0%
representative conley
 
02:40:36.630 --> 02:40:36.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:39.110 --> 02:40:39.120 align:start position:0%
mr speaker um i believe we had a healthy
 
02:40:39.120 --> 02:40:40.309 align:start position:0%
mr speaker um i believe we had a healthy
discussion

02:40:40.309 --> 02:40:40.319 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
02:40:42.630 --> 02:40:42.640 align:start position:0%
uh percolating earlier this morning and
 
02:40:44.469 --> 02:40:44.479 align:start position:0%
i think it would be healthy to continue
 
02:40:46.550 --> 02:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
that discussion uh just for a little
 
02:40:48.389 --> 02:40:48.399 align:start position:0%
while longer to consider possible
 
02:40:48.399 --> 02:40:55.030 align:start position:0%
while longer to consider possible
amendments

02:40:55.030 --> 02:40:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:56.950 --> 02:40:56.960 align:start position:0%
but representative roy you wish you
 
02:41:00.070 --> 02:41:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:01.590 --> 02:41:01.600 align:start position:0%
i would move
 
02:41:05.269 --> 02:41:05.279 align:start position:0%
in expedient to legislate on house bill
 
02:41:09.110 --> 02:41:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:12.309 --> 02:41:12.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:14.870 --> 02:41:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:17.110 --> 02:41:17.120 align:start position:0%
the motion cannot be seconded or made by
 
02:41:17.120 --> 02:41:20.070 align:start position:0%
the motion cannot be seconded or made by
assad

02:41:20.070 --> 02:41:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:37.990 --> 02:41:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:40.469 --> 02:41:40.479 align:start position:0%
i believe that you told us as a group
 
02:41:42.710 --> 02:41:42.720 align:start position:0%
that if we had amendments that you would
 
02:41:45.830 --> 02:41:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:48.230 --> 02:41:48.240 align:start position:0%
is there but what let me ask you let me
 
02:41:49.269 --> 02:41:49.279 align:start position:0%
ask this question what would that
 
02:41:49.279 --> 02:41:51.510 align:start position:0%
ask this question what would that
amendment

02:41:51.510 --> 02:41:51.520 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
02:41:53.030 --> 02:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
look like
 
02:41:55.429 --> 02:41:55.439 align:start position:0%
i don't it was on people's and i think
 
02:41:57.190 --> 02:41:57.200 align:start position:0%
it was on uh
 
02:41:57.200 --> 02:41:58.469 align:start position:0%
it was on uh
religion

02:41:58.469 --> 02:41:58.479 align:start position:0%
religion
 
02:42:00.230 --> 02:42:00.240 align:start position:0%
and national origins
 
02:42:03.110 --> 02:42:03.120 align:start position:0%
i spoke to it he was amendable to
 
02:42:07.190 --> 02:42:07.200 align:start position:0%
amendment so i'm i'm just not sure
 
02:42:15.429 --> 02:42:15.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:17.590 --> 02:42:17.600 align:start position:0%
c and d i don't think has changed under
 
02:42:19.510 --> 02:42:19.520 align:start position:0%
the existing law
 
02:42:20.870 --> 02:42:20.880 align:start position:0%
you don't need to specify anything
 
02:42:22.389 --> 02:42:22.399 align:start position:0%
beyond person it's really the paragraph
 
02:42:25.429 --> 02:42:25.439 align:start position:0%
b it's expanding to public property then
 
02:42:26.630 --> 02:42:26.640 align:start position:0%
whether the
 
02:42:30.150 --> 02:42:30.160 align:start position:0%
target of the vandalism is
 
02:42:31.510 --> 02:42:31.520 align:start position:0%
is it
 
02:42:33.590 --> 02:42:33.600 align:start position:0%
a class of individuals as opposed to a
 
02:42:35.429 --> 02:42:35.439 align:start position:0%
specific person
 
02:42:35.439 --> 02:42:36.309 align:start position:0%
specific person
what

02:42:36.309 --> 02:42:36.319 align:start position:0%
what
 
02:42:39.750 --> 02:42:39.760 align:start position:0%
my my understanding is by changing that
 
02:42:41.670 --> 02:42:41.680 align:start position:0%
what would the change to that paragraph
 
02:42:43.990 --> 02:42:44.000 align:start position:0%
be that you would like to make on b and
 
02:42:47.030 --> 02:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
d on just the sub paragraph b if there
 
02:42:49.830 --> 02:42:49.840 align:start position:0%
was an amendment that you were to
 
02:43:06.230 --> 02:43:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:06.240 --> 02:43:07.429 align:start position:0%
 
religion

02:43:07.429 --> 02:43:07.439 align:start position:0%
religion
 
02:43:08.950 --> 02:43:08.960 align:start position:0%
was the um
 
02:43:11.990 --> 02:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:14.309 --> 02:43:14.319 align:start position:0%
so you would you would
 
02:43:16.950 --> 02:43:16.960 align:start position:0%
prefer to strike religion no i want
 
02:43:19.750 --> 02:43:19.760 align:start position:0%
religion in there
 
02:43:22.469 --> 02:43:22.479 align:start position:0%
religion we were striking
 
02:43:26.389 --> 02:43:26.399 align:start position:0%
some of the classes because i felt that
 
02:43:30.469 --> 02:43:30.479 align:start position:0%
persons would also identify as classes
 
02:43:32.070 --> 02:43:32.080 align:start position:0%
it doesn't you know
 
02:43:43.030 --> 02:43:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:44.870 --> 02:43:44.880 align:start position:0%
either way the point of the matter is
 
02:43:46.230 --> 02:43:46.240 align:start position:0%
like i said that
 
02:43:48.710 --> 02:43:48.720 align:start position:0%
what you have told us is that if we
 
02:43:50.710 --> 02:43:50.720 align:start position:0%
thought we had amendments
 
02:43:53.910 --> 02:43:53.920 align:start position:0%
um that you would not exact so i guess
 
02:43:56.150 --> 02:43:56.160 align:start position:0%
what you're saying if you agree
 
02:43:58.630 --> 02:43:58.640 align:start position:0%
we would not exec but if you disagree
 
02:44:00.790 --> 02:44:00.800 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering you know how did we get to
 
02:44:03.429 --> 02:44:03.439 align:start position:0%
where we are right now in this meeting
 
02:44:05.030 --> 02:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
in this committee
 
02:44:07.510 --> 02:44:07.520 align:start position:0%
my i think when we recessed the last
 
02:44:10.630 --> 02:44:10.640 align:start position:0%
this this executive session
 
02:44:13.349 --> 02:44:13.359 align:start position:0%
hospital 11 17 the
 
02:44:15.910 --> 02:44:15.920 align:start position:0%
purpose was that there was a
 
02:44:18.230 --> 02:44:18.240 align:start position:0%
bill on criminal mischief that would
 
02:44:18.240 --> 02:44:19.510 align:start position:0%
bill on criminal mischief that would
involve

02:44:19.510 --> 02:44:19.520 align:start position:0%
involve
 
02:44:22.150 --> 02:44:22.160 align:start position:0%
vandalism in spraying graffiti on public
 
02:44:23.429 --> 02:44:23.439 align:start position:0%
property which
 
02:44:27.030 --> 02:44:27.040 align:start position:0%
is what this bill also is addressing
 
02:44:28.630 --> 02:44:28.640 align:start position:0%
so we addressed that in the last hearing
 
02:44:31.510 --> 02:44:31.520 align:start position:0%
so my my understanding is if
 
02:44:34.550 --> 02:44:34.560 align:start position:0%
the prior bill which was
 
02:44:37.110 --> 02:44:37.120 align:start position:0%
was it house built 10 11.
 
02:44:38.630 --> 02:44:38.640 align:start position:0%
i'm just explaining i mean you asked the
 
02:44:40.150 --> 02:44:40.160 align:start position:0%
question to answer it so what i'm saying
 
02:44:40.160 --> 02:44:41.110 align:start position:0%
question to answer it so what i'm saying
is

02:44:41.110 --> 02:44:41.120 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:44:43.269 --> 02:44:43.279 align:start position:0%
in this scenario regardless of what the
 
02:44:45.590 --> 02:44:45.600 align:start position:0%
graffiti is it's now a class a it would
 
02:44:47.510 --> 02:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
be a class a misdemeanor
 
02:44:49.990 --> 02:44:50.000 align:start position:0%
that where under the current law
 
02:44:51.990 --> 02:44:52.000 align:start position:0%
it's a violation so a person spray
 
02:44:52.000 --> 02:44:53.269 align:start position:0%
it's a violation so a person spray
painting

02:44:53.269 --> 02:44:53.279 align:start position:0%
painting
 
02:44:55.750 --> 02:44:55.760 align:start position:0%
you know racist hate symbols on public
 
02:45:00.790 --> 02:45:00.800 align:start position:0%
property is is a violation it's a ticket
 
02:45:01.990 --> 02:45:02.000 align:start position:0%
it's now going to be a class a
 
02:45:06.469 --> 02:45:06.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:07.830 --> 02:45:07.840 align:start position:0%
the mere fact that they're spray
 
02:45:09.590 --> 02:45:09.600 align:start position:0%
painting on the on that property or
 
02:45:12.309 --> 02:45:12.319 align:start position:0%
doing that is now a class a misdemeanor
 
02:45:12.319 --> 02:45:13.670 align:start position:0%
doing that is now a class a misdemeanor
the

02:45:13.670 --> 02:45:13.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:45:16.790 --> 02:45:16.800 align:start position:0%
intent of what the symbol is
 
02:45:18.230 --> 02:45:18.240 align:start position:0%
i don't i think
 
02:45:19.670 --> 02:45:19.680 align:start position:0%
i'm not saying that's irrelevant that
 
02:45:21.110 --> 02:45:21.120 align:start position:0%
matters but it
 
02:45:22.630 --> 02:45:22.640 align:start position:0%
for the purposes of the elements of the
 
02:45:22.640 --> 02:45:23.750 align:start position:0%
for the purposes of the elements of the
offense

02:45:23.750 --> 02:45:23.760 align:start position:0%
offense
 
02:45:25.429 --> 02:45:25.439 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't have to prove that it was
 
02:45:27.190 --> 02:45:27.200 align:start position:0%
targeted at a group of people it's the
 
02:45:28.950 --> 02:45:28.960 align:start position:0%
mere fact of doing the act
 
02:45:30.630 --> 02:45:30.640 align:start position:0%
i'm reading between the lines here but
 
02:45:33.110 --> 02:45:33.120 align:start position:0%
that seems to me seems to me to think
 
02:45:35.990 --> 02:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
why was nothing done about what happened
 
02:45:38.150 --> 02:45:38.160 align:start position:0%
maybe that's because it was a violation
 
02:45:40.630 --> 02:45:40.640 align:start position:0%
and it's a ticket
 
02:45:42.630 --> 02:45:42.640 align:start position:0%
so even if you found the person who in
 
02:45:44.309 --> 02:45:44.319 align:start position:0%
the person owned up to it
 
02:45:46.550 --> 02:45:46.560 align:start position:0%
you were writing them a ticket
 
02:45:47.990 --> 02:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
apparel that's that's what you would be
 
02:45:48.000 --> 02:45:51.510 align:start position:0%
apparel that's that's what you would be
doing

02:45:51.510 --> 02:45:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:55.030 --> 02:45:55.040 align:start position:0%
i understand that it's a misdemeanor now
 
02:45:57.510 --> 02:45:57.520 align:start position:0%
i'm clear about that but this is more
 
02:45:59.750 --> 02:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
house cleaning as well
 
02:46:07.269 --> 02:46:07.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:07.279 --> 02:46:08.309 align:start position:0%
 
and

02:46:08.309 --> 02:46:08.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:46:11.590 --> 02:46:11.600 align:start position:0%
just to go back to my original comment
 
02:46:14.469 --> 02:46:14.479 align:start position:0%
was what you told us as a group
 
02:46:19.349 --> 02:46:19.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:21.269 --> 02:46:21.279 align:start position:0%
i i i understand that i already i've
 
02:46:22.630 --> 02:46:22.640 align:start position:0%
recognized someone for emotion of
 
02:46:30.950 --> 02:46:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:34.150 --> 02:46:34.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:35.750 --> 02:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
thank you i i'm
 
02:46:38.710 --> 02:46:38.720 align:start position:0%
i just want to clarify what we are now
 
02:46:41.110 --> 02:46:41.120 align:start position:0%
in executive sessions yes and the
 
02:46:42.309 --> 02:46:42.319 align:start position:0%
question is
 
02:46:43.750 --> 02:46:43.760 align:start position:0%
motion has been made
 
02:46:45.990 --> 02:46:46.000 align:start position:0%
to inexpensive legislation
 
02:46:49.349 --> 02:46:49.359 align:start position:0%
okay i understand that and now we have
 
02:46:51.269 --> 02:46:51.279 align:start position:0%
the ability to
 
02:46:54.550 --> 02:46:54.560 align:start position:0%
make comments or questions or
 
02:46:58.150 --> 02:46:58.160 align:start position:0%
what what may we do at this point
 
02:47:03.750 --> 02:47:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:06.230 --> 02:47:06.240 align:start position:0%
okay we are debating the question of the
 
02:47:09.030 --> 02:47:09.040 align:start position:0%
motion of inexpensive legislate
 
02:47:11.830 --> 02:47:11.840 align:start position:0%
that is what the question has been
 
02:47:14.550 --> 02:47:14.560 align:start position:0%
is going to be moved i am
 
02:47:17.349 --> 02:47:17.359 align:start position:0%
you are free to speak in support
 
02:47:20.710 --> 02:47:20.720 align:start position:0%
or against
 
02:47:20.720 --> 02:47:22.790 align:start position:0%
or against
follow-up

02:47:22.790 --> 02:47:22.800 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
02:47:25.030 --> 02:47:25.040 align:start position:0%
you're recognized to speak in support or
 
02:47:25.040 --> 02:47:25.990 align:start position:0%
you're recognized to speak in support or
against

02:47:25.990 --> 02:47:26.000 align:start position:0%
against
 
02:47:27.670 --> 02:47:27.680 align:start position:0%
or say you're undecided you have been
 
02:47:29.190 --> 02:47:29.200 align:start position:0%
recognized i don't know what else i can
 
02:47:39.990 --> 02:47:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:40.000 --> 02:47:40.870 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:47:40.870 --> 02:47:40.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:47:44.070 --> 02:47:44.080 align:start position:0%
well the previous bill does uh
 
02:47:45.990 --> 02:47:46.000 align:start position:0%
uh state a uh
 
02:47:49.349 --> 02:47:49.359 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor for uh
 
02:47:52.950 --> 02:47:52.960 align:start position:0%
mischievous uh conduct and
 
02:47:55.830 --> 02:47:55.840 align:start position:0%
but that is that the
 
02:47:58.389 --> 02:47:58.399 align:start position:0%
most likely the penalty
 
02:48:00.230 --> 02:48:00.240 align:start position:0%
that would incur
 
02:48:00.240 --> 02:48:01.269 align:start position:0%
that would incur
would

02:48:01.269 --> 02:48:01.279 align:start position:0%
would
 
02:48:05.670 --> 02:48:05.680 align:start position:0%
be based on the amount of cost for the
 
02:48:05.680 --> 02:48:07.510 align:start position:0%
be based on the amount of cost for the
damage

02:48:07.510 --> 02:48:07.520 align:start position:0%
damage
 
02:48:10.150 --> 02:48:10.160 align:start position:0%
and this bill
 
02:48:12.389 --> 02:48:12.399 align:start position:0%
even though it does talk about
 
02:48:15.750 --> 02:48:15.760 align:start position:0%
uh on private property
 
02:48:17.590 --> 02:48:17.600 align:start position:0%
the intent
 
02:48:19.830 --> 02:48:19.840 align:start position:0%
or the damage could be
 
02:48:23.670 --> 02:48:23.680 align:start position:0%
very small as far as cost-wise
 
02:48:23.680 --> 02:48:25.269 align:start position:0%
very small as far as cost-wise
but

02:48:25.269 --> 02:48:25.279 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:48:25.279 --> 02:48:26.389 align:start position:0%
but
the

02:48:26.389 --> 02:48:26.399 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:48:30.389 --> 02:48:30.399 align:start position:0%
intent of the crime is to
 
02:48:33.110 --> 02:48:33.120 align:start position:0%
be terroristic are
 
02:48:34.469 --> 02:48:34.479 align:start position:0%
for someone
 
02:48:34.479 --> 02:48:35.510 align:start position:0%
for someone
to

02:48:35.510 --> 02:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:48:37.030 --> 02:48:37.040 align:start position:0%
fear for
 
02:48:39.110 --> 02:48:39.120 align:start position:0%
their safety
 
02:48:42.230 --> 02:48:42.240 align:start position:0%
so i can't see that those two
 
02:48:44.870 --> 02:48:44.880 align:start position:0%
these two matters are equivalent even
 
02:48:47.429 --> 02:48:47.439 align:start position:0%
though the penalty is the same because
 
02:48:50.790 --> 02:48:50.800 align:start position:0%
with intent we have uh
 
02:48:52.870 --> 02:48:52.880 align:start position:0%
different really two different crimes
 
02:48:54.710 --> 02:48:54.720 align:start position:0%
being committed
 
02:48:57.429 --> 02:48:57.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:59.990 --> 02:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
representative roy you're recognized
 
02:49:01.670 --> 02:49:01.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
02:49:05.030 --> 02:49:05.040 align:start position:0%
um the reason i'm moving in expedient to
 
02:49:05.040 --> 02:49:06.309 align:start position:0%
um the reason i'm moving in expedient to
legislate

02:49:06.309 --> 02:49:06.319 align:start position:0%
legislate
 
02:49:08.950 --> 02:49:08.960 align:start position:0%
is because
 
02:49:13.030 --> 02:49:13.040 align:start position:0%
in in my mind any person covers all all
 
02:49:14.469 --> 02:49:14.479 align:start position:0%
these additions
 
02:49:17.510 --> 02:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
and when you try to add
 
02:49:19.590 --> 02:49:19.600 align:start position:0%
classes or or
 
02:49:21.830 --> 02:49:21.840 align:start position:0%
any type of specialized group of people
 
02:49:23.349 --> 02:49:23.359 align:start position:0%
to a bill like this
 
02:49:25.030 --> 02:49:25.040 align:start position:0%
you're inevitably going to leave some
 
02:49:28.309 --> 02:49:28.319 align:start position:0%
out um i don't see veterans
 
02:49:30.870 --> 02:49:30.880 align:start position:0%
um and and i'm you know
 
02:49:32.550 --> 02:49:32.560 align:start position:0%
we could be offended just as well
 
02:49:33.990 --> 02:49:34.000 align:start position:0%
there's other groups there's there's
 
02:49:36.550 --> 02:49:36.560 align:start position:0%
lots of groups so the best way is to be
 
02:49:40.230 --> 02:49:40.240 align:start position:0%
all-inclusive by saying persons
 
02:49:42.150 --> 02:49:42.160 align:start position:0%
and it covers everybody when we try to
 
02:49:45.110 --> 02:49:45.120 align:start position:0%
give special status we invariably leave
 
02:49:47.110 --> 02:49:47.120 align:start position:0%
somebody out that's why it's best to be
 
02:49:49.510 --> 02:49:49.520 align:start position:0%
all-inclusive and that's why i'm moving
 
02:49:54.070 --> 02:49:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:55.990 --> 02:49:56.000 align:start position:0%
representative klein knight
 
02:49:58.950 --> 02:49:58.960 align:start position:0%
thank you chair uh representative
 
02:50:01.110 --> 02:50:01.120 align:start position:0%
uh roy is correct it doesn't say persons
 
02:50:02.630 --> 02:50:02.640 align:start position:0%
it just says person which is why it
 
02:50:06.630 --> 02:50:06.640 align:start position:0%
needs to be amended and updated and
 
02:50:06.640 --> 02:50:09.269 align:start position:0%
needs to be amended and updated and
also

02:50:09.269 --> 02:50:09.279 align:start position:0%
also
 
02:50:12.230 --> 02:50:12.240 align:start position:0%
with all due respect the exasperation
 
02:50:13.990 --> 02:50:14.000 align:start position:0%
from my colleagues
 
02:50:15.910 --> 02:50:15.920 align:start position:0%
is really disappointing as a jewish
 
02:50:19.750 --> 02:50:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:19.760 --> 02:50:21.590 align:start position:0%
 
and

02:50:21.590 --> 02:50:21.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:50:22.950 --> 02:50:22.960 align:start position:0%
i want
 
02:50:25.670 --> 02:50:25.680 align:start position:0%
to ask the chair that if he thinks
 
02:50:27.670 --> 02:50:27.680 align:start position:0%
criminal mischief is the same thing as a
 
02:50:32.389 --> 02:50:32.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:34.950 --> 02:50:34.960 align:start position:0%
is that a question
 
02:50:37.269 --> 02:50:37.279 align:start position:0%
it's a completely different crime
 
02:50:39.269 --> 02:50:39.279 align:start position:0%
then why are we having this conversation
 
02:50:40.710 --> 02:50:40.720 align:start position:0%
with you trying to loop it into the
 
02:50:44.950 --> 02:50:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:47.510 --> 02:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
you're asking for the intent of the last
 
02:50:48.790 --> 02:50:48.800 align:start position:0%
comment i made
 
02:50:51.510 --> 02:50:51.520 align:start position:0%
i and i the point that i was making
 
02:50:53.349 --> 02:50:53.359 align:start position:0%
was when there was graffiti spray
 
02:50:56.870 --> 02:50:56.880 align:start position:0%
painted on the wall and an organization
 
02:50:58.630 --> 02:50:58.640 align:start position:0%
took credit for doing that
 
02:50:58.640 --> 02:50:59.349 align:start position:0%
took credit for doing that
and

02:50:59.349 --> 02:50:59.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:51:02.150 --> 02:51:02.160 align:start position:0%
it was a hate symbol i was concerned why
 
02:51:04.309 --> 02:51:04.319 align:start position:0%
there was no
 
02:51:07.590 --> 02:51:07.600 align:start position:0%
prosecution or charges brought against
 
02:51:10.150 --> 02:51:10.160 align:start position:0%
any individual and i thought that to be
 
02:51:11.590 --> 02:51:11.600 align:start position:0%
very odd
 
02:51:13.990 --> 02:51:14.000 align:start position:0%
it was on public property in the mere
 
02:51:16.070 --> 02:51:16.080 align:start position:0%
fact of the spray painting
 
02:51:18.950 --> 02:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
hate symbol aside i was my understanding
 
02:51:20.790 --> 02:51:20.800 align:start position:0%
against law
 
02:51:23.750 --> 02:51:23.760 align:start position:0%
the next bill thereafter involved
 
02:51:25.910 --> 02:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
graffiti on public property
 
02:51:27.750 --> 02:51:27.760 align:start position:0%
and in that case it's changing from a
 
02:51:31.030 --> 02:51:31.040 align:start position:0%
violation to a class a misdemeanor so
 
02:51:33.110 --> 02:51:33.120 align:start position:0%
the point that i was making
 
02:51:34.469 --> 02:51:34.479 align:start position:0%
is that
 
02:51:38.950 --> 02:51:38.960 align:start position:0%
the hate symbol aside it was actually
 
02:51:40.550 --> 02:51:40.560 align:start position:0%
all it was was a violation was the
 
02:51:42.070 --> 02:51:42.080 align:start position:0%
offense and
 
02:51:43.349 --> 02:51:43.359 align:start position:0%
my thought was
 
02:51:45.830 --> 02:51:45.840 align:start position:0%
perhaps that was one of the reasons why
 
02:51:48.150 --> 02:51:48.160 align:start position:0%
it wasn't a prosecution
 
02:51:48.160 --> 02:51:49.750 align:start position:0%
it wasn't a prosecution
behind

02:51:49.750 --> 02:51:49.760 align:start position:0%
behind
 
02:51:49.760 --> 02:51:50.550 align:start position:0%
behind
the

02:51:50.550 --> 02:51:50.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:51:52.230 --> 02:51:52.240 align:start position:0%
hateful spray paint that happened in
 
02:51:54.150 --> 02:51:54.160 align:start position:0%
nashua that's that's my under that's
 
02:51:56.630 --> 02:51:56.640 align:start position:0%
just what i was explaining
 
02:51:58.389 --> 02:51:58.399 align:start position:0%
i understand they hate the issue of the
 
02:52:00.870 --> 02:52:00.880 align:start position:0%
hate crime side of it but the mere act
 
02:52:02.710 --> 02:52:02.720 align:start position:0%
of the graffiti
 
02:52:04.870 --> 02:52:04.880 align:start position:0%
is now would be a class a misdemeanor as
 
02:52:06.710 --> 02:52:06.720 align:start position:0%
opposed to a violation so that would
 
02:52:08.630 --> 02:52:08.640 align:start position:0%
cover more than just the mere fact that
 
02:52:10.630 --> 02:52:10.640 align:start position:0%
it's a hate crime it's not discrediting
 
02:52:11.910 --> 02:52:11.920 align:start position:0%
or ignoring
 
02:52:14.710 --> 02:52:14.720 align:start position:0%
the other issue great caused by what
 
02:52:16.150 --> 02:52:16.160 align:start position:0%
that what happened in nashua i
 
02:52:18.550 --> 02:52:18.560 align:start position:0%
understand that and i appreciate that
 
02:52:18.560 --> 02:52:19.670 align:start position:0%
understand that and i appreciate that
but

02:52:19.670 --> 02:52:19.680 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:52:21.429 --> 02:52:21.439 align:start position:0%
the elements of the offense you wouldn't
 
02:52:23.110 --> 02:52:23.120 align:start position:0%
have to necessarily prove the intent the
 
02:52:25.269 --> 02:52:25.279 align:start position:0%
intent is that they were
 
02:52:27.510 --> 02:52:27.520 align:start position:0%
vandalizing public property
 
02:52:28.870 --> 02:52:28.880 align:start position:0%
spray painting would do that whether
 
02:52:31.110 --> 02:52:31.120 align:start position:0%
it's a hate symbol or a peace symbol
 
02:52:33.269 --> 02:52:33.279 align:start position:0%
that's the crime so it does address
 
02:52:35.269 --> 02:52:35.279 align:start position:0%
some of the concern there where it would
 
02:52:37.190 --> 02:52:37.200 align:start position:0%
prevent that from happening
 
02:52:39.030 --> 02:52:39.040 align:start position:0%
it just doesn't directly say it
 
02:52:40.550 --> 02:52:40.560 align:start position:0%
i'm not saying it solves the problem but
 
02:52:42.950 --> 02:52:42.960 align:start position:0%
it does address it so you're saying what
 
02:52:44.550 --> 02:52:44.560 align:start position:0%
happened in nashua wasn't a hate crime
 
02:52:49.910 --> 02:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:52.469 --> 02:52:52.479 align:start position:0%
and and to be to be clear
 
02:52:54.550 --> 02:52:54.560 align:start position:0%
any behavior relating to that anyone who
 
02:52:56.070 --> 02:52:56.080 align:start position:0%
does that that that should not be
 
02:52:58.469 --> 02:52:58.479 align:start position:0%
tolerated by our society and certainly
 
02:53:00.070 --> 02:53:00.080 align:start position:0%
not accepted by anyone that i know in
 
02:53:01.030 --> 02:53:01.040 align:start position:0%
this state
 
02:53:03.510 --> 02:53:03.520 align:start position:0%
then why are we tolerating not allowing
 
02:53:05.349 --> 02:53:05.359 align:start position:0%
an amendment to move forward to do
 
02:53:08.070 --> 02:53:08.080 align:start position:0%
housekeeping on this bill
 
02:53:09.670 --> 02:53:09.680 align:start position:0%
and represent klein knight if you were
 
02:53:11.910 --> 02:53:11.920 align:start position:0%
inclined to to prepare an amendment what
 
02:53:13.990 --> 02:53:14.000 align:start position:0%
would your amendment say
 
02:53:16.309 --> 02:53:16.319 align:start position:0%
i would add the word peoples after
 
02:53:16.319 --> 02:53:17.349 align:start position:0%
i would add the word peoples after
people

02:53:17.349 --> 02:53:17.359 align:start position:0%
people
 
02:53:19.030 --> 02:53:19.040 align:start position:0%
or persons
 
02:53:21.190 --> 02:53:21.200 align:start position:0%
for to insinuate a group of people and
 
02:53:22.230 --> 02:53:22.240 align:start position:0%
not just
 
02:53:25.110 --> 02:53:25.120 align:start position:0%
one person
 
02:53:25.120 --> 02:53:25.830 align:start position:0%
one person
so

02:53:25.830 --> 02:53:25.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:53:28.230 --> 02:53:28.240 align:start position:0%
so let me just clarify
 
02:53:30.870 --> 02:53:30.880 align:start position:0%
as opposed to listing
 
02:53:30.880 --> 02:53:31.910 align:start position:0%
as opposed to listing
several

02:53:31.910 --> 02:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
several
 
02:53:33.830 --> 02:53:33.840 align:start position:0%
classes of individuals
 
02:53:36.309 --> 02:53:36.319 align:start position:0%
you would just say
 
02:53:39.830 --> 02:53:39.840 align:start position:0%
terrorize any person or persons
 
02:53:41.830 --> 02:53:41.840 align:start position:0%
and that's all that's all the amen would
 
02:53:41.840 --> 02:53:42.870 align:start position:0%
and that's all that's all the amen would
say

02:53:42.870 --> 02:53:42.880 align:start position:0%
say
 
02:53:45.110 --> 02:53:45.120 align:start position:0%
i want to indicate the language that a
 
02:53:46.950 --> 02:53:46.960 align:start position:0%
group of people is still has the right
 
02:53:49.110 --> 02:53:49.120 align:start position:0%
to be just as protected as one person
 
02:53:49.120 --> 02:54:03.429 align:start position:0%
to be just as protected as one person
yes

02:54:03.429 --> 02:54:03.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:03.439 --> 02:54:07.910 align:start position:0%
 
it

02:54:07.910 --> 02:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:09.510 --> 02:54:09.520 align:start position:0%
represent representative you were
 
02:54:09.520 --> 02:54:10.550 align:start position:0%
represent representative you were
recognized

02:54:10.550 --> 02:54:10.560 align:start position:0%
recognized
 
02:54:13.030 --> 02:54:13.040 align:start position:0%
um thank you mr chairman i'm just trying
 
02:54:14.469 --> 02:54:14.479 align:start position:0%
to make sure that i understand this
 
02:54:16.550 --> 02:54:16.560 align:start position:0%
correctly um i understand that what
 
02:54:18.309 --> 02:54:18.319 align:start position:0%
happened in nashua was absolutely
 
02:54:20.870 --> 02:54:20.880 align:start position:0%
horrible and should not be accepted
 
02:54:22.710 --> 02:54:22.720 align:start position:0%
we're looking at this and looking at
 
02:54:25.030 --> 02:54:25.040 align:start position:0%
adding these specific groups of people
 
02:54:26.710 --> 02:54:26.720 align:start position:0%
so that we can classify this as a
 
02:54:26.720 --> 02:54:28.150 align:start position:0%
so that we can classify this as a
misdemeanor

02:54:28.150 --> 02:54:28.160 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor
 
02:54:28.160 --> 02:54:29.030 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor
and

02:54:29.030 --> 02:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:54:31.269 --> 02:54:31.279 align:start position:0%
what because that's what's listed as the
 
02:54:34.790 --> 02:54:34.800 align:start position:0%
penalty in here um the penalty so i'm
 
02:54:36.389 --> 02:54:36.399 align:start position:0%
just trying to understand how this isn't
 
02:54:39.590 --> 02:54:39.600 align:start position:0%
covered by what we did um the the action
 
02:54:39.600 --> 02:54:40.630 align:start position:0%
covered by what we did um the the action
itself

02:54:40.630 --> 02:54:40.640 align:start position:0%
itself
 
02:54:42.389 --> 02:54:42.399 align:start position:0%
um would be covered as a misdemeanor
 
02:54:46.070 --> 02:54:46.080 align:start position:0%
just as we're looking at here um and
 
02:54:48.150 --> 02:54:48.160 align:start position:0%
and the
 
02:54:49.269 --> 02:54:49.279 align:start position:0%
i'm just trying i'm just trying to
 
02:54:57.030 --> 02:54:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:59.510 --> 02:54:59.520 align:start position:0%
representative conley
 
02:55:00.950 --> 02:55:00.960 align:start position:0%
thank you and i apologize to the
 
02:55:02.870 --> 02:55:02.880 align:start position:0%
representative for shaking my head when
 
02:55:05.110 --> 02:55:05.120 align:start position:0%
you were speaking but i my understanding
 
02:55:08.070 --> 02:55:08.080 align:start position:0%
is uh this contemplates a class b felony
 
02:55:22.710 --> 02:55:22.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:26.469 --> 02:55:26.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:28.309 --> 02:55:28.319 align:start position:0%
i'll have to review the statute please
 
02:55:29.990 --> 02:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
forgive me
 
02:55:31.830 --> 02:55:31.840 align:start position:0%
just give me a moment i'll i can look
 
02:56:04.710 --> 02:56:04.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:06.070 --> 02:56:06.080 align:start position:0%
representative harry gareth right you're
 
02:56:06.080 --> 02:56:11.110 align:start position:0%
representative harry gareth right you're
recognized

02:56:11.110 --> 02:56:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:12.950 --> 02:56:12.960 align:start position:0%
if you use a deadly weapon
 
02:56:14.630 --> 02:56:14.640 align:start position:0%
then it's a felony
 
02:56:18.790 --> 02:56:18.800 align:start position:0%
other than that it's a misdemeanor
 
02:56:34.630 --> 02:56:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:37.030 --> 02:56:37.040 align:start position:0%
this is the question representative
 
02:56:38.550 --> 02:56:38.560 align:start position:0%
calmly what the point i was trying to
 
02:56:40.070 --> 02:56:40.080 align:start position:0%
make and i'm not sure if i communicated
 
02:56:41.030 --> 02:56:41.040 align:start position:0%
that well
 
02:56:42.150 --> 02:56:42.160 align:start position:0%
was that
 
02:56:44.950 --> 02:56:44.960 align:start position:0%
the prior build that we exact would make
 
02:56:46.870 --> 02:56:46.880 align:start position:0%
it a class a misdemeanor this is the yes
 
02:56:49.429 --> 02:56:49.439 align:start position:0%
it's a separate and distinct charge
 
02:56:50.469 --> 02:56:50.479 align:start position:0%
but it
 
02:56:52.790 --> 02:56:52.800 align:start position:0%
it's it isn't it would overlap a little
 
02:56:54.950 --> 02:56:54.960 align:start position:0%
bit there but i guess my question is if
 
02:56:58.469 --> 02:56:58.479 align:start position:0%
you made it person any person or persons
 
02:57:00.389 --> 02:57:00.399 align:start position:0%
i didn't read that as i don't interpret
 
02:57:02.070 --> 02:57:02.080 align:start position:0%
that as already being
 
02:57:03.349 --> 02:57:03.359 align:start position:0%
an individual
 
02:57:07.190 --> 02:57:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:09.590 --> 02:57:09.600 align:start position:0%
that's just my interpretation i i know
 
02:57:10.469 --> 02:57:10.479 align:start position:0%
representative solemn might have
 
02:57:12.469 --> 02:57:12.479 align:start position:0%
disagreed with that but i i didn't read
 
02:57:13.990 --> 02:57:14.000 align:start position:0%
it that way
 
02:57:15.830 --> 02:57:15.840 align:start position:0%
that it you would have to pluralize
 
02:57:17.830 --> 02:57:17.840 align:start position:0%
persons in order to apply to a
 
02:57:25.670 --> 02:57:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:27.670 --> 02:57:27.680 align:start position:0%
they can be more as written in the law
 
02:57:29.110 --> 02:57:29.120 align:start position:0%
today they can be more than one victim
 
02:57:30.389 --> 02:57:30.399 align:start position:0%
of said crime
 
02:57:32.469 --> 02:57:32.479 align:start position:0%
that's why i'm just trying to i i the
 
02:57:34.309 --> 02:57:34.319 align:start position:0%
points well taken by representative
 
02:57:34.319 --> 02:57:35.349 align:start position:0%
points well taken by representative
clinic

02:57:35.349 --> 02:57:35.359 align:start position:0%
clinic
 
02:57:38.309 --> 02:57:38.319 align:start position:0%
to pluralize it but
 
02:57:40.550 --> 02:57:40.560 align:start position:0%
is that necessary i just it's a quest
 
02:57:41.990 --> 02:57:42.000 align:start position:0%
it's just a question i mean
 
02:57:44.389 --> 02:57:44.399 align:start position:0%
representative sullivan
 
02:57:45.990 --> 02:57:46.000 align:start position:0%
i guess
 
02:57:48.710 --> 02:57:48.720 align:start position:0%
this is not just any list of individuals
 
02:57:50.950 --> 02:57:50.960 align:start position:0%
these are the protected class of people
 
02:57:53.510 --> 02:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
against discrimination this is not an
 
02:57:55.750 --> 02:57:55.760 align:start position:0%
accidental list
 
02:57:55.760 --> 02:57:56.469 align:start position:0%
accidental list
so

02:57:56.469 --> 02:57:56.479 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:57:58.870 --> 02:57:58.880 align:start position:0%
i think it's important to keep
 
02:58:00.870 --> 02:58:00.880 align:start position:0%
that list of
 
02:58:03.670 --> 02:58:03.680 align:start position:0%
individuals in here
 
02:58:05.750 --> 02:58:05.760 align:start position:0%
i can accept the fact that c and d might
 
02:58:08.710 --> 02:58:08.720 align:start position:0%
not uh be necessary but
 
02:58:10.550 --> 02:58:10.560 align:start position:0%
in b
 
02:58:12.950 --> 02:58:12.960 align:start position:0%
this is the list of protected classes of
 
02:58:15.750 --> 02:58:15.760 align:start position:0%
individuals from discrimination
 
02:58:18.389 --> 02:58:18.399 align:start position:0%
and i believe having that in here is
 
02:58:18.399 --> 02:58:19.830 align:start position:0%
and i believe having that in here is
meaningful

02:58:19.830 --> 02:58:19.840 align:start position:0%
meaningful
 
02:58:29.030 --> 02:58:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:31.269 --> 02:58:31.279 align:start position:0%
perhaps i just look at it is that if
 
02:58:33.269 --> 02:58:33.279 align:start position:0%
if someone were to do any any anything
 
02:58:35.110 --> 02:58:35.120 align:start position:0%
like this and direct it towards
 
02:58:37.030 --> 02:58:37.040 align:start position:0%
uh you know just use my race for an
 
02:58:37.040 --> 02:58:38.070 align:start position:0%
uh you know just use my race for an
example

02:58:38.070 --> 02:58:38.080 align:start position:0%
example
 
02:58:39.750 --> 02:58:39.760 align:start position:0%
i would put that i would just personally
 
02:58:41.349 --> 02:58:41.359 align:start position:0%
think it would fall into the definition
 
02:58:44.630 --> 02:58:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:50.230 --> 02:58:50.240 align:start position:0%

my colleagues and i

03:03:16.560 --> 03:03:17.510 align:start position:0%
where many of our customers have become

03:03:23.429 --> 03:03:23.439 align:start position:0%
as much as we care about them
 
03:03:26.070 --> 03:03:26.080 align:start position:0%
but in any given week our store is also
 
03:03:27.750 --> 03:03:27.760 align:start position:0%
a gathering place
 
03:03:30.070 --> 03:03:30.080 align:start position:0%
for thousands of people
 
03:03:32.230 --> 03:03:32.240 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic and the hardships it
 
03:03:33.670 --> 03:03:33.680 align:start position:0%
is presented
 
03:03:35.830 --> 03:03:35.840 align:start position:0%
people have been stressed sometimes to
 
03:03:38.070 --> 03:03:38.080 align:start position:0%
the breaking point
 
03:03:40.630 --> 03:03:40.640 align:start position:0%
i don't have to go into detail
 
03:03:42.630 --> 03:03:42.640 align:start position:0%
about the incidents of harassment
 
03:03:42.640 --> 03:03:43.670 align:start position:0%
about the incidents of harassment
threatening

03:03:43.670 --> 03:03:43.680 align:start position:0%
threatening
 
03:03:45.750 --> 03:03:45.760 align:start position:0%
assault and even murder that have
 
03:03:49.590 --> 03:03:49.600 align:start position:0%
occurred in places like grocery stores
 
03:03:52.309 --> 03:03:52.319 align:start position:0%
and contrary to what you may believe
 
03:03:54.150 --> 03:03:54.160 align:start position:0%
one of the most frightening incidents i
 
03:03:54.160 --> 03:03:55.429 align:start position:0%
one of the most frightening incidents i
encountered

03:03:55.429 --> 03:03:55.439 align:start position:0%
encountered
 
03:03:57.349 --> 03:03:57.359 align:start position:0%
came one night from a guest who was
 
03:03:59.830 --> 03:03:59.840 align:start position:0%
upset that other customers were not
 
03:04:01.910 --> 03:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
wearing masks
 
03:04:03.670 --> 03:04:03.680 align:start position:0%
and there was a mask ordinance in
 
03:04:06.630 --> 03:04:06.640 align:start position:0%
lebanon at the time
 
03:04:08.790 --> 03:04:08.800 align:start position:0%
it's not often in life that you see a
 
03:04:11.030 --> 03:04:11.040 align:start position:0%
short wall that divides you from another
 
03:04:11.040 --> 03:04:11.990 align:start position:0%
short wall that divides you from another
person

03:04:11.990 --> 03:04:12.000 align:start position:0%
person
 
03:04:14.150 --> 03:04:14.160 align:start position:0%
as a life-saving device
 
03:04:16.309 --> 03:04:16.319 align:start position:0%
but that night during that customer's
 
03:04:19.110 --> 03:04:19.120 align:start position:0%
fit of rage i knew that if that wall
 
03:04:21.429 --> 03:04:21.439 align:start position:0%
hadn't been there i would have been hit
 
03:04:23.510 --> 03:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
or worse
 
03:04:26.389 --> 03:04:26.399 align:start position:0%
i've had things shoved in my face
 
03:04:28.150 --> 03:04:28.160 align:start position:0%
in my eyes
 
03:04:30.630 --> 03:04:30.640 align:start position:0%
have had to move tearful colleagues away
 
03:04:32.230 --> 03:04:32.240 align:start position:0%
from situations
 
03:04:33.750 --> 03:04:33.760 align:start position:0%
where they've been so severely
 
03:04:35.750 --> 03:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
threatened that their hands are shaking
 
03:04:39.110 --> 03:04:39.120 align:start position:0%
too much to put groceries in bags
 
03:04:41.110 --> 03:04:41.120 align:start position:0%
i've seen our store manager call the
 
03:04:43.590 --> 03:04:43.600 align:start position:0%
local police on several occasions
 
03:04:46.070 --> 03:04:46.080 align:start position:0%
to escort angry customers on the verge
 
03:04:48.630 --> 03:04:48.640 align:start position:0%
of violence out of the store
 
03:04:50.469 --> 03:04:50.479 align:start position:0%
but that's all that can be done at this
 
03:04:50.479 --> 03:04:51.510 align:start position:0%
but that's all that can be done at this
point

03:04:51.510 --> 03:04:51.520 align:start position:0%
point
 
03:04:54.070 --> 03:04:54.080 align:start position:0%
those customers can and frequently do
 
03:04:56.550 --> 03:04:56.560 align:start position:0%
come back to repeat the behavior that
 
03:04:59.990 --> 03:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
got them into trouble in the first place
 
03:05:01.990 --> 03:05:02.000 align:start position:0%
i've proposed this bill
 
03:05:04.790 --> 03:05:04.800 align:start position:0%
which amends section 631 of the criminal
 
03:05:04.800 --> 03:05:05.830 align:start position:0%
which amends section 631 of the criminal
code

03:05:05.830 --> 03:05:05.840 align:start position:0%
code
 
03:05:08.469 --> 03:05:08.479 align:start position:0%
to give police more options in dealing
 
03:05:12.309 --> 03:05:12.319 align:start position:0%
with unruly customers patients or guests
 
03:05:14.870 --> 03:05:14.880 align:start position:0%
in any of the businesses in our state
 
03:05:17.030 --> 03:05:17.040 align:start position:0%
that are deemed essential
 
03:05:19.030 --> 03:05:19.040 align:start position:0%
i discussed the reasoning behind the
 
03:05:22.710 --> 03:05:22.720 align:start position:0%
bill and its potential impact excuse me
 
03:05:24.790 --> 03:05:24.800 align:start position:0%
with lebanon's chief of police phillip
 
03:05:27.910 --> 03:05:27.920 align:start position:0%
roberts who supports it strongly and
 
03:05:29.990 --> 03:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
agrees that it will give his officers
 
03:05:33.590 --> 03:05:33.600 align:start position:0%
more tools in their toolbox to work with
 
03:05:36.710 --> 03:05:36.720 align:start position:0%
i also see it as an ounce of prevention
 
03:05:39.429 --> 03:05:39.439 align:start position:0%
perhaps making people think twice
 
03:05:41.110 --> 03:05:41.120 align:start position:0%
if they know there may be harsh
 
03:05:43.590 --> 03:05:43.600 align:start position:0%
consequences for abusing an essential
 
03:05:43.600 --> 03:05:45.269 align:start position:0%
consequences for abusing an essential
worker

03:05:45.269 --> 03:05:45.279 align:start position:0%
worker
 
03:05:47.269 --> 03:05:47.279 align:start position:0%
i have seen some objections on the
 
03:05:49.030 --> 03:05:49.040 align:start position:0%
grounds that we should not treat these
 
03:05:51.590 --> 03:05:51.600 align:start position:0%
workers differently from others
 
03:05:53.590 --> 03:05:53.600 align:start position:0%
that everyone should be equal under the
 
03:05:53.600 --> 03:05:54.790 align:start position:0%
that everyone should be equal under the
law

03:05:54.790 --> 03:05:54.800 align:start position:0%
law
 
03:05:57.590 --> 03:05:57.600 align:start position:0%
but in new hampshire law we have already
 
03:06:00.309 --> 03:06:00.319 align:start position:0%
carved out specific penalties for
 
03:06:02.469 --> 03:06:02.479 align:start position:0%
harming elected officials
 
03:06:05.590 --> 03:06:05.600 align:start position:0%
law enforcement officers the elderly and
 
03:06:05.600 --> 03:06:07.030 align:start position:0%
law enforcement officers the elderly and
others

03:06:07.030 --> 03:06:07.040 align:start position:0%
others
 
03:06:10.309 --> 03:06:10.319 align:start position:0%
clearly the reasoning behind these laws
 
03:06:12.070 --> 03:06:12.080 align:start position:0%
acknowledged that some
 
03:06:14.790 --> 03:06:14.800 align:start position:0%
people while equal under the law
 
03:06:17.750 --> 03:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
are in professions or life situations
 
03:06:19.910 --> 03:06:19.920 align:start position:0%
that make them more vulnerable than
 
03:06:19.920 --> 03:06:21.910 align:start position:0%
that make them more vulnerable than
others

03:06:21.910 --> 03:06:21.920 align:start position:0%
others
 
03:06:24.950 --> 03:06:24.960 align:start position:0%
hp 1017 simply seeks
 
03:06:28.150 --> 03:06:28.160 align:start position:0%
to address the unique vulnerability of
 
03:06:30.710 --> 03:06:30.720 align:start position:0%
frontline workers who show up day after
 
03:06:30.720 --> 03:06:31.590 align:start position:0%
frontline workers who show up day after
day

03:06:31.590 --> 03:06:31.600 align:start position:0%
day
 
03:06:33.190 --> 03:06:33.200 align:start position:0%
even though they know it could put them
 
03:06:35.750 --> 03:06:35.760 align:start position:0%
in harm's way
 
03:06:37.670 --> 03:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
we've spent the last two and a half
 
03:06:37.680 --> 03:06:38.630 align:start position:0%
we've spent the last two and a half
years

03:06:38.630 --> 03:06:38.640 align:start position:0%
years
 
03:06:40.950 --> 03:06:40.960 align:start position:0%
thanking essential workers for doing the
 
03:06:43.910 --> 03:06:43.920 align:start position:0%
work that lets us get on with our lives
 
03:06:46.790 --> 03:06:46.800 align:start position:0%
despite pandemics constrained supply
 
03:06:50.710 --> 03:06:50.720 align:start position:0%
lines and any number of other challenges
 
03:06:52.550 --> 03:06:52.560 align:start position:0%
i hope you will consider an ought to
 
03:06:53.830 --> 03:06:53.840 align:start position:0%
pass vote
 
03:06:57.590 --> 03:06:57.600 align:start position:0%
for hb 1017 it will make those gestures
 
03:07:00.309 --> 03:07:00.319 align:start position:0%
of gratitude really meaningful
 
03:07:02.550 --> 03:07:02.560 align:start position:0%
under the difficult circumstances many
 
03:07:05.190 --> 03:07:05.200 align:start position:0%
essential workers and law enforcement
 
03:07:07.670 --> 03:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
officers manage every day
 
03:07:09.190 --> 03:07:09.200 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and i'm happy to
 
03:07:13.190 --> 03:07:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:15.429 --> 03:07:15.439 align:start position:0%
representative roy you're recognized
 
03:07:17.110 --> 03:07:17.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
03:07:19.190 --> 03:07:19.200 align:start position:0%
taking my question over here
 
03:07:19.200 --> 03:07:19.910 align:start position:0%
taking my question over here
hi

03:07:19.910 --> 03:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
hi
 
03:07:19.920 --> 03:07:21.269 align:start position:0%
hi
um

03:07:21.269 --> 03:07:21.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:07:21.279 --> 03:07:22.230 align:start position:0%
um
so

03:07:22.230 --> 03:07:22.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:07:26.630 --> 03:07:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:28.469 --> 03:07:28.479 align:start position:0%
the essential worker
 
03:07:28.479 --> 03:07:29.670 align:start position:0%
the essential worker
definition

03:07:29.670 --> 03:07:29.680 align:start position:0%
definition
 
03:07:32.950 --> 03:07:32.960 align:start position:0%
that is an exhibit i understand
 
03:07:35.510 --> 03:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
only applies during a state of emergency
 
03:07:37.510 --> 03:07:37.520 align:start position:0%
is it your intent with this statute to
 
03:07:39.830 --> 03:07:39.840 align:start position:0%
make these essential workers identified
 
03:07:42.230 --> 03:07:42.240 align:start position:0%
in the governor's order
 
03:07:43.830 --> 03:07:43.840 align:start position:0%
permanent even if there isn't a state of
 
03:07:43.840 --> 03:07:46.710 align:start position:0%
permanent even if there isn't a state of
emergency

03:07:46.710 --> 03:07:46.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:46.720 --> 03:07:48.230 align:start position:0%
 
yes

03:07:48.230 --> 03:07:48.240 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:07:48.240 --> 03:07:50.550 align:start position:0%
yes
follow-up

03:07:50.550 --> 03:07:50.560 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
03:07:52.070 --> 03:07:52.080 align:start position:0%
you reckon you were recognized for a
 
03:07:52.080 --> 03:07:53.830 align:start position:0%
you reckon you were recognized for a
follow-up

03:07:53.830 --> 03:07:53.840 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
03:07:54.870 --> 03:07:54.880 align:start position:0%
and again
 
03:07:56.230 --> 03:07:56.240 align:start position:0%
i'm going to probably ask almost the
 
03:07:58.950 --> 03:07:58.960 align:start position:0%
same question but in a different way so
 
03:08:01.429 --> 03:08:01.439 align:start position:0%
it's your intent that regardless of the
 
03:08:04.309 --> 03:08:04.319 align:start position:0%
state of emergency or the country if
 
03:08:06.950 --> 03:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
everything's going smoothly if someone
 
03:08:08.710 --> 03:08:08.720 align:start position:0%
threatens or or doesn't need things
 
03:08:11.110 --> 03:08:11.120 align:start position:0%
listed in here against a grocery store
 
03:08:13.349 --> 03:08:13.359 align:start position:0%
employee or any other person who was
 
03:08:15.110 --> 03:08:15.120 align:start position:0%
deemed essential by that governor's
 
03:08:15.120 --> 03:08:15.990 align:start position:0%
deemed essential by that governor's
order

03:08:15.990 --> 03:08:16.000 align:start position:0%
order
 
03:08:17.990 --> 03:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
they should be given this special
 
03:08:20.710 --> 03:08:20.720 align:start position:0%
protection of this law yeah and and i
 
03:08:23.429 --> 03:08:23.439 align:start position:0%
think i understand the intent of your
 
03:08:25.110 --> 03:08:25.120 align:start position:0%
question so let me see if i can try and
 
03:08:27.990 --> 03:08:28.000 align:start position:0%
address that okay thank you um in in
 
03:08:29.830 --> 03:08:29.840 align:start position:0%
crafting this bill
 
03:08:32.469 --> 03:08:32.479 align:start position:0%
i tried hard to arrive at that
 
03:08:34.469 --> 03:08:34.479 align:start position:0%
definition of essential workers because
 
03:08:37.269 --> 03:08:37.279 align:start position:0%
it didn't want it to kind of slop over
 
03:08:39.670 --> 03:08:39.680 align:start position:0%
into everyone right
 
03:08:43.269 --> 03:08:43.279 align:start position:0%
so um so i used the tool
 
03:08:46.550 --> 03:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
of the governor's emergency order
 
03:08:48.469 --> 03:08:48.479 align:start position:0%
as as the thing that
 
03:08:49.910 --> 03:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
might help this
 
03:08:52.550 --> 03:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
and bring some clarity to it
 
03:08:55.349 --> 03:08:55.359 align:start position:0%
but but i was not thinking that well
 
03:08:57.750 --> 03:08:57.760 align:start position:0%
this means we're in an indefinite state
 
03:09:00.710 --> 03:09:00.720 align:start position:0%
of emergency it was simply a tool to
 
03:09:02.550 --> 03:09:02.560 align:start position:0%
help clarify
 
03:09:05.590 --> 03:09:05.600 align:start position:0%
who under certain circumstances might be
 
03:09:07.990 --> 03:09:08.000 align:start position:0%
deemed essential workers and i know from
 
03:09:10.469 --> 03:09:10.479 align:start position:0%
my work in the private sector in private
 
03:09:12.070 --> 03:09:12.080 align:start position:0%
higher education
 
03:09:13.590 --> 03:09:13.600 align:start position:0%
that we
 
03:09:13.600 --> 03:09:15.110 align:start position:0%
that we
have

03:09:15.110 --> 03:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:09:16.630 --> 03:09:16.640 align:start position:0%
a group of people that are deemed
 
03:09:18.550 --> 03:09:18.560 align:start position:0%
essential workers
 
03:09:21.269 --> 03:09:21.279 align:start position:0%
regardless of the conditions going on
 
03:09:23.910 --> 03:09:23.920 align:start position:0%
around us you know we could a volcano
 
03:09:25.510 --> 03:09:25.520 align:start position:0%
could have exploded on the campus and
 
03:09:27.750 --> 03:09:27.760 align:start position:0%
we'd know who the essential workers were
 
03:09:31.110 --> 03:09:31.120 align:start position:0%
so that was the tool i had at hand
 
03:09:33.990 --> 03:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
under the law but i did not intend for
 
03:09:35.590 --> 03:09:35.600 align:start position:0%
this to be
 
03:09:38.150 --> 03:09:38.160 align:start position:0%
a perpetuation of a state of emergency
 
03:09:42.150 --> 03:09:42.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:43.910 --> 03:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
representative roy you recognize for a
 
03:09:46.790 --> 03:09:46.800 align:start position:0%
follow-up thank you again mr chairman um
 
03:09:49.110 --> 03:09:49.120 align:start position:0%
it does with regard to the definition
 
03:09:50.870 --> 03:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
i'm not i have no quibbling with what
 
03:09:53.190 --> 03:09:53.200 align:start position:0%
what you used to define an essential
 
03:09:53.200 --> 03:09:54.150 align:start position:0%
what you used to define an essential
worker

03:09:54.150 --> 03:09:54.160 align:start position:0%
worker
 
03:09:54.160 --> 03:09:55.830 align:start position:0%
worker
um

03:09:55.830 --> 03:09:55.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:09:58.469 --> 03:09:58.479 align:start position:0%
my question though is is why
 
03:10:01.030 --> 03:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
in other words essential workers is kind
 
03:10:03.590 --> 03:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
of this it's a new concept that was made
 
03:10:05.990 --> 03:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
by the state of emergency
 
03:10:08.710 --> 03:10:08.720 align:start position:0%
are you suggesting that in normal times
 
03:10:11.190 --> 03:10:11.200 align:start position:0%
when there's no state of emergency
 
03:10:13.670 --> 03:10:13.680 align:start position:0%
these people are are always essential
 
03:10:15.590 --> 03:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
workers and should always be have the
 
03:10:17.990 --> 03:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
extra protection or only if another
 
03:10:20.550 --> 03:10:20.560 align:start position:0%
state of emergency were to become
 
03:10:22.389 --> 03:10:22.399 align:start position:0%
active where
 
03:10:24.070 --> 03:10:24.080 align:start position:0%
the essential workers were identified
 
03:10:24.080 --> 03:10:25.190 align:start position:0%
the essential workers were identified
again

03:10:25.190 --> 03:10:25.200 align:start position:0%
again
 
03:10:27.830 --> 03:10:27.840 align:start position:0%
that's a really good question
 
03:10:27.840 --> 03:10:31.349 align:start position:0%
that's a really good question
um

03:10:31.349 --> 03:10:31.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:33.750 --> 03:10:33.760 align:start position:0%
as i said before
 
03:10:36.790 --> 03:10:36.800 align:start position:0%
in in my life in the private sector
 
03:10:38.790 --> 03:10:38.800 align:start position:0%
there is a pool of employees that are
 
03:10:41.190 --> 03:10:41.200 align:start position:0%
deemed essential regardless of what's
 
03:10:42.630 --> 03:10:42.640 align:start position:0%
going on
 
03:10:45.190 --> 03:10:45.200 align:start position:0%
i understand that may not be the case at
 
03:10:48.070 --> 03:10:48.080 align:start position:0%
the state level but it may
 
03:10:50.309 --> 03:10:50.319 align:start position:0%
because all states have to have chains
 
03:10:52.550 --> 03:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
of command in response to emergencies
 
03:10:54.550 --> 03:10:54.560 align:start position:0%
and so there may be a different
 
03:10:54.560 --> 03:10:55.990 align:start position:0%
and so there may be a different
definition

03:10:55.990 --> 03:10:56.000 align:start position:0%
definition
 
03:10:57.830 --> 03:10:57.840 align:start position:0%
that could be brought to bear in an
 
03:10:57.840 --> 03:10:59.030 align:start position:0%
that could be brought to bear in an
amendment

03:10:59.030 --> 03:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
03:10:59.040 --> 03:11:00.710 align:start position:0%
amendment
um

03:11:00.710 --> 03:11:00.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:11:02.710 --> 03:11:02.720 align:start position:0%
if it made people more comfortable i was
 
03:11:05.110 --> 03:11:05.120 align:start position:0%
just looking for a way
 
03:11:09.750 --> 03:11:09.760 align:start position:0%
to to classify a certain group of people
 
03:11:12.070 --> 03:11:12.080 align:start position:0%
where the brunt has fallen heavily on
 
03:11:12.080 --> 03:11:13.510 align:start position:0%
where the brunt has fallen heavily on
them

03:11:13.510 --> 03:11:13.520 align:start position:0%
them
 
03:11:15.030 --> 03:11:15.040 align:start position:0%
and not necessarily because of the
 
03:11:22.070 --> 03:11:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:23.990 --> 03:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
representative newman
 
03:11:25.750 --> 03:11:25.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
03:11:25.760 --> 03:11:27.030 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
um

03:11:27.030 --> 03:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:11:29.349 --> 03:11:29.359 align:start position:0%
when you wrote the bill and did your
 
03:11:31.750 --> 03:11:31.760 align:start position:0%
research about and referred to the
 
03:11:35.030 --> 03:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
definition that's in the emergency order
 
03:11:38.710 --> 03:11:38.720 align:start position:0%
um was there a reason why you
 
03:11:41.429 --> 03:11:41.439 align:start position:0%
didn't just take the definition that was
 
03:11:44.950 --> 03:11:44.960 align:start position:0%
in the in that order and put it into the
 
03:11:47.030 --> 03:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
into the law as the definition of
 
03:11:48.630 --> 03:11:48.640 align:start position:0%
essential worker for the purposes of
 
03:11:52.469 --> 03:11:52.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:54.550 --> 03:11:54.560 align:start position:0%
oh i'm so ashamed to say this but i
 
03:11:57.110 --> 03:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
think it was just laziness so
 
03:12:00.309 --> 03:12:00.319 align:start position:0%
it seemed it seemed easy to you know to
 
03:12:00.319 --> 03:12:01.910 align:start position:0%
it seemed it seemed easy to you know to
reference

03:12:01.910 --> 03:12:01.920 align:start position:0%
reference
 
03:12:03.269 --> 03:12:03.279 align:start position:0%
that order
 
03:12:05.590 --> 03:12:05.600 align:start position:0%
because to my knowledge and
 
03:12:07.910 --> 03:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
understanding and you folks have the
 
03:12:10.150 --> 03:12:10.160 align:start position:0%
expertise that i don't to know this more
 
03:12:11.830 --> 03:12:11.840 align:start position:0%
than me
 
03:12:14.229 --> 03:12:14.239 align:start position:0%
that was the only place that
 
03:12:16.469 --> 03:12:16.479 align:start position:0%
definition that classification existed
 
03:12:19.830 --> 03:12:19.840 align:start position:0%
if it exists elsewhere
 
03:12:21.590 --> 03:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
it would be good to know
 
03:12:24.389 --> 03:12:24.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:27.349 --> 03:12:27.359 align:start position:0%
um so would you be amenable if that
 
03:12:29.830 --> 03:12:29.840 align:start position:0%
if there were there were amendments that
 
03:12:33.349 --> 03:12:33.359 align:start position:0%
were to be made that quoted
 
03:12:35.349 --> 03:12:35.359 align:start position:0%
the definition that's in the emergency
 
03:12:35.359 --> 03:12:36.309 align:start position:0%
the definition that's in the emergency
order

03:12:36.309 --> 03:12:36.319 align:start position:0%
order
 
03:12:37.510 --> 03:12:37.520 align:start position:0%
and makes that
 
03:12:40.150 --> 03:12:40.160 align:start position:0%
the definition of essential worker
 
03:12:42.070 --> 03:12:42.080 align:start position:0%
for the purposes of this law and the law
 
03:12:43.990 --> 03:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
i absolutely would be amenable and i was
 
03:12:45.830 --> 03:12:45.840 align:start position:0%
looking forward to speaking with you
 
03:12:48.070 --> 03:12:48.080 align:start position:0%
today because i know that you have
 
03:12:49.750 --> 03:12:49.760 align:start position:0%
the expertise
 
03:12:52.229 --> 03:12:52.239 align:start position:0%
that that i lack coming from municipal
 
03:12:53.990 --> 03:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
and county government
 
03:12:55.269 --> 03:12:55.279 align:start position:0%
just to comment
 
03:12:57.110 --> 03:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
no one has ever
 
03:12:58.550 --> 03:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
referred to this committee in that way
 
03:13:07.510 --> 03:13:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:09.910 --> 03:13:09.920 align:start position:0%
representative bert
 
03:13:11.510 --> 03:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
03:13:11.520 --> 03:13:12.830 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
your

03:13:12.830 --> 03:13:12.840 align:start position:0%
your
 
03:13:17.910 --> 03:13:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:20.070 --> 03:13:20.080 align:start position:0%
would it allow a
 
03:13:22.550 --> 03:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
essential worker
 
03:13:22.560 --> 03:13:24.469 align:start position:0%
essential worker
to

03:13:24.469 --> 03:13:24.479 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:13:26.550 --> 03:13:26.560 align:start position:0%
call the police or file charges you know
 
03:13:27.670 --> 03:13:27.680 align:start position:0%
i think they'd have to call the police
 
03:13:29.349 --> 03:13:29.359 align:start position:0%
to file charges
 
03:13:32.389 --> 03:13:32.399 align:start position:0%
against an employer
 
03:13:32.399 --> 03:13:33.750 align:start position:0%
against an employer
against

03:13:33.750 --> 03:13:33.760 align:start position:0%
against
 
03:13:36.309 --> 03:13:36.319 align:start position:0%
a government official or a
 
03:13:38.870 --> 03:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
or the federal government
 
03:13:41.590 --> 03:13:41.600 align:start position:0%
if they require
 
03:13:43.110 --> 03:13:43.120 align:start position:0%
an employee
 
03:13:44.950 --> 03:13:44.960 align:start position:0%
to get the vaccine
 
03:13:47.269 --> 03:13:47.279 align:start position:0%
and they find it harmful
 
03:13:49.190 --> 03:13:49.200 align:start position:0%
to their body that they don't want the
 
03:13:51.429 --> 03:13:51.439 align:start position:0%
vaccine could they use this law if it
 
03:13:52.790 --> 03:13:52.800 align:start position:0%
was passed
 
03:13:55.750 --> 03:13:55.760 align:start position:0%
to file against a business or a
 
03:13:57.830 --> 03:13:57.840 align:start position:0%
company or or the federal government
 
03:14:03.269 --> 03:14:03.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:05.590 --> 03:14:05.600 align:start position:0%
i i guess the honest answer is i don't
 
03:14:13.030 --> 03:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:16.229 --> 03:14:16.239 align:start position:0%
it's not the intent of the bill
 
03:14:17.910 --> 03:14:17.920 align:start position:0%
but it's a really good question all
 
03:14:23.590 --> 03:14:23.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:25.750 --> 03:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
03:14:34.630 --> 03:14:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:36.630 --> 03:14:36.640 align:start position:0%
okay the committee now calls roscoe
 
03:14:36.640 --> 03:14:51.429 align:start position:0%
okay the committee now calls roscoe
putnam

03:14:51.429 --> 03:14:51.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:54.630 --> 03:14:54.640 align:start position:0%
i've never done this before
 
03:14:54.640 --> 03:14:55.590 align:start position:0%
i've never done this before
so

03:14:55.590 --> 03:14:55.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:14:58.070 --> 03:14:58.080 align:start position:0%
excuse me if my mouth gets dry
 
03:15:00.229 --> 03:15:00.239 align:start position:0%
or i lose my thoughts
 
03:15:01.429 --> 03:15:01.439 align:start position:0%
but i want to tell you a little bit
 
03:15:02.710 --> 03:15:02.720 align:start position:0%
about myself
 
03:15:04.790 --> 03:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
my name is roscoe putnam
 
03:15:06.469 --> 03:15:06.479 align:start position:0%

listen thrift store in lebanon new
 
03:15:10.550 --> 03:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire i never realized that i was
 
03:15:13.190 --> 03:15:13.200 align:start position:0%
going to become an essential worker
 
03:15:14.790 --> 03:15:14.800 align:start position:0%
listen provides services to the
 
03:15:18.469 --> 03:15:18.479 align:start position:0%
community for people that are homeless
 
03:15:18.479 --> 03:15:19.830 align:start position:0%
community for people that are homeless
hungry

03:15:19.830 --> 03:15:19.840 align:start position:0%
hungry
 
03:15:27.510 --> 03:15:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:30.150 --> 03:15:30.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:31.990 --> 03:15:32.000 align:start position:0%
september 19th
 
03:15:34.790 --> 03:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
i was working at the listen thrift store
 
03:15:37.510 --> 03:15:37.520 align:start position:0%
and an unmasked family
 
03:15:40.389 --> 03:15:40.399 align:start position:0%
came into the thrift store
 
03:15:42.550 --> 03:15:42.560 align:start position:0%
and i was alerted
 
03:15:45.510 --> 03:15:45.520 align:start position:0%
by a fellow staff person that we had
 
03:15:49.349 --> 03:15:49.359 align:start position:0%
unmaskers on the site
 
03:15:51.349 --> 03:15:51.359 align:start position:0%
the employee approached them
 
03:15:52.950 --> 03:15:52.960 align:start position:0%
and said you need to wear masks because
 
03:15:54.309 --> 03:15:54.319 align:start position:0%
there's a mandate in lebanon new
 
03:15:56.070 --> 03:15:56.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire that all
 
03:15:57.910 --> 03:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
people in a public place need to be
 
03:15:59.349 --> 03:15:59.359 align:start position:0%
wearing a mask
 
03:16:01.349 --> 03:16:01.359 align:start position:0%
it was done professionally it was done
 
03:16:05.269 --> 03:16:05.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:07.269 --> 03:16:07.279 align:start position:0%
i was then summoned
 
03:16:10.389 --> 03:16:10.399 align:start position:0%
to talk to the woman
 
03:16:13.429 --> 03:16:13.439 align:start position:0%
while the gentleman left the building
 
03:16:15.030 --> 03:16:15.040 align:start position:0%
i approached the woman and i said we
 
03:16:17.190 --> 03:16:17.200 align:start position:0%
have a mass policy in lebanon
 
03:16:20.630 --> 03:16:20.640 align:start position:0%
and i would like you to wear a mask
 
03:16:23.110 --> 03:16:23.120 align:start position:0%
at that point she began to get very
 
03:16:23.120 --> 03:16:24.950 align:start position:0%
at that point she began to get very
agitated

03:16:24.950 --> 03:16:24.960 align:start position:0%
agitated
 
03:16:27.349 --> 03:16:27.359 align:start position:0%
her agitation quickly turned to
 
03:16:27.359 --> 03:16:29.030 align:start position:0%
her agitation quickly turned to
threatening

03:16:29.030 --> 03:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
threatening
 
03:16:31.750 --> 03:16:31.760 align:start position:0%
threatening me and other customers in
 
03:16:34.550 --> 03:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:37.510 --> 03:16:37.520 align:start position:0%
i then went to the office called the
 
03:16:39.750 --> 03:16:39.760 align:start position:0%
lebanon police department and asked them
 
03:16:41.590 --> 03:16:41.600 align:start position:0%

03:16:41.600 --> 03:16:44.309 align:start position:0%

customer

03:16:44.309 --> 03:16:44.319 align:start position:0%
customer
 
03:16:45.990 --> 03:16:46.000 align:start position:0%
between the time i made that telephone
 
03:16:46.000 --> 03:16:47.510 align:start position:0%
between the time i made that telephone
call

03:16:47.510 --> 03:16:47.520 align:start position:0%
call
 
03:16:47.520 --> 03:16:48.710 align:start position:0%
call
and

03:16:48.710 --> 03:16:48.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:16:50.389 --> 03:16:50.399 align:start position:0%
the end of the incident which i'll go
 
03:16:52.229 --> 03:16:52.239 align:start position:0%
into in a moment
 
03:16:54.309 --> 03:16:54.319 align:start position:0%
the woman continued to escalate to the
 
03:16:55.990 --> 03:16:56.000 align:start position:0%
point where people were taking out their
 
03:16:57.429 --> 03:16:57.439 align:start position:0%
phones and
 
03:16:57.439 --> 03:16:58.710 align:start position:0%
phones and
videoing

03:16:58.710 --> 03:16:58.720 align:start position:0%
videoing
 
03:16:58.720 --> 03:16:59.830 align:start position:0%
videoing
her

03:16:59.830 --> 03:16:59.840 align:start position:0%
her
 
03:16:59.840 --> 03:17:01.750 align:start position:0%
her
meltdown

03:17:01.750 --> 03:17:01.760 align:start position:0%
meltdown
 
03:17:04.630 --> 03:17:04.640 align:start position:0%
she was throwing things at me
 
03:17:07.030 --> 03:17:07.040 align:start position:0%
yes they were pieces of jewelry
 
03:17:08.950 --> 03:17:08.960 align:start position:0%
they weren't harmful
 
03:17:10.710 --> 03:17:10.720 align:start position:0%
she was threatening me
 
03:17:13.590 --> 03:17:13.600 align:start position:0%
to take me to court
 
03:17:17.990 --> 03:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:20.550 --> 03:17:20.560 align:start position:0%
i then opened the front door and told
 
03:17:22.870 --> 03:17:22.880 align:start position:0%
her she needs to leave you need to leave
 
03:17:22.880 --> 03:17:23.750 align:start position:0%
her she needs to leave you need to leave
now

03:17:23.750 --> 03:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
now
 
03:17:25.510 --> 03:17:25.520 align:start position:0%
i'd never met this person before i had
 
03:17:27.830 --> 03:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
no communication with her other than
 
03:17:29.269 --> 03:17:29.279 align:start position:0%
that day
 
03:17:31.670 --> 03:17:31.680 align:start position:0%
she at that time said i hope
 
03:17:34.070 --> 03:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
you have a car accident on the way home
 
03:17:37.670 --> 03:17:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:39.269 --> 03:17:39.279 align:start position:0%
i didn't know what an essential worker
 
03:17:41.910 --> 03:17:41.920 align:start position:0%
was up until that day
 
03:17:43.670 --> 03:17:43.680 align:start position:0%
and then i realized that i was there to
 
03:17:45.910 --> 03:17:45.920 align:start position:0%
protect the public
 
03:17:48.870 --> 03:17:48.880 align:start position:0%
and my staff i'm an assistant manager at
 
03:17:52.630 --> 03:17:52.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:54.870 --> 03:17:54.880 align:start position:0%
as i opened the door
 
03:17:56.389 --> 03:17:56.399 align:start position:0%
there were now
 
03:18:00.710 --> 03:18:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:03.349 --> 03:18:03.359 align:start position:0%
i was telling her to leave
 
03:18:05.910 --> 03:18:05.920 align:start position:0%
i held the door open and as she went by
 
03:18:09.830 --> 03:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
me she took my right arm and bit me
 
03:18:14.309 --> 03:18:14.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:16.070 --> 03:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
i ended up having to go to the emergency
 
03:18:17.510 --> 03:18:17.520 align:start position:0%

i returned to work that day
 
03:18:30.309 --> 03:18:30.319 align:start position:0%
and i returned to work that day because
 
03:18:33.429 --> 03:18:33.439 align:start position:0%
i felt i needed to continue to protect
 
03:18:34.950 --> 03:18:34.960 align:start position:0%

03:18:50.229 --> 03:18:50.239 align:start position:0%
i don't know if that's been resolved yet
 
03:18:52.630 --> 03:18:52.640 align:start position:0%
i haven't followed through
 
03:18:54.630 --> 03:18:54.640 align:start position:0%
to follow it because i am continuing to
 
03:18:58.950 --> 03:18:58.960 align:start position:0%
work at listen community services
 
03:19:01.510 --> 03:19:01.520 align:start position:0%
i hope you will take this bill
 
03:19:01.520 --> 03:19:02.389 align:start position:0%
i hope you will take this bill
under

03:19:02.389 --> 03:19:02.399 align:start position:0%
under
 
03:19:02.399 --> 03:19:03.830 align:start position:0%
under
advisement

03:19:03.830 --> 03:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
advisement
 
03:19:06.469 --> 03:19:06.479 align:start position:0%
make amendments to make it clear what is
 
03:19:08.950 --> 03:19:08.960 align:start position:0%
an essential worker and what isn't
 
03:19:10.229 --> 03:19:10.239 align:start position:0%
and maybe you never thought a thrift
 
03:19:11.990 --> 03:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
store worker was an essential worker
 
03:19:13.750 --> 03:19:13.760 align:start position:0%
well i didn't either
 
03:19:16.790 --> 03:19:16.800 align:start position:0%
but i ask you to support this bill
 
03:19:18.389 --> 03:19:18.399 align:start position:0%
and give the police
 
03:19:18.399 --> 03:19:19.349 align:start position:0%
and give the police
that

03:19:19.349 --> 03:19:19.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:19:21.830 --> 03:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
the ammunition that they need to protect
 
03:19:24.309 --> 03:19:24.319 align:start position:0%
the essential workers
 
03:19:26.870 --> 03:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
from this type of an assault
 
03:19:28.309 --> 03:19:28.319 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and i'll be glad to
 
03:19:33.750 --> 03:19:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:42.150 --> 03:19:42.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:43.990 --> 03:19:44.000 align:start position:0%
we all set
 
03:19:45.590 --> 03:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you again for
 
03:19:47.110 --> 03:19:47.120 align:start position:0%
your testimony
 
03:19:49.110 --> 03:19:49.120 align:start position:0%
the committee now calls
 
03:19:58.790 --> 03:19:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:00.389 --> 03:20:00.399 align:start position:0%
thank you for allowing me to speak with
 
03:20:01.590 --> 03:20:01.600 align:start position:0%
you today
 
03:20:04.710 --> 03:20:04.720 align:start position:0%
although i completely understand and
 
03:20:06.710 --> 03:20:06.720 align:start position:0%
empathize with
 
03:20:08.790 --> 03:20:08.800 align:start position:0%
mr putnam's situation
 
03:20:12.710 --> 03:20:12.720 align:start position:0%
um and i understand no human
 
03:20:14.630 --> 03:20:14.640 align:start position:0%
should go through what he went through
 
03:20:17.190 --> 03:20:17.200 align:start position:0%
whether he's an essential worker or not
 
03:20:19.510 --> 03:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
and i think that's the bigger thing here
 
03:20:22.070 --> 03:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
is this is about this is a human rights
 
03:20:23.830 --> 03:20:23.840 align:start position:0%
thing this is not
 
03:20:26.389 --> 03:20:26.399 align:start position:0%
this is not an essential worker versus a
 
03:20:28.550 --> 03:20:28.560 align:start position:0%
non-essential worker
 
03:20:32.150 --> 03:20:32.160 align:start position:0%
we've already divided our our state and
 
03:20:35.190 --> 03:20:35.200 align:start position:0%
our people so much that unfortunately
 
03:20:36.550 --> 03:20:36.560 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
03:20:40.389 --> 03:20:40.399 align:start position:0%
in my opinion causes further division um
 
03:20:41.910 --> 03:20:41.920 align:start position:0%
that being said
 
03:20:44.710 --> 03:20:44.720 align:start position:0%
the appropriate i feel the appropriate
 
03:20:47.269 --> 03:20:47.279 align:start position:0%
action we have a criminal justice system
 
03:20:50.630 --> 03:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
that um arrested this individual and is
 
03:20:53.349 --> 03:20:53.359 align:start position:0%
prosecuting this individual and we have
 
03:20:58.630 --> 03:20:58.640 align:start position:0%
to rely on our municipalities and our
 
03:21:01.269 --> 03:21:01.279 align:start position:0%
our lower levels of government to be
 
03:21:04.790 --> 03:21:04.800 align:start position:0%
able to appropriately
 
03:21:07.030 --> 03:21:07.040 align:start position:0%
handle those type of situations
 
03:21:08.790 --> 03:21:08.800 align:start position:0%
the other thing
 
03:21:11.269 --> 03:21:11.279 align:start position:0%
my concern is is that
 
03:21:14.229 --> 03:21:14.239 align:start position:0%
we're going to make this bill would make
 
03:21:16.950 --> 03:21:16.960 align:start position:0%
it a felony
 
03:21:18.550 --> 03:21:18.560 align:start position:0%
um to
 
03:21:18.560 --> 03:21:20.070 align:start position:0%
um to
to

03:21:20.070 --> 03:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:21:22.229 --> 03:21:22.239 align:start position:0%
to um
 
03:21:22.239 --> 03:21:23.190 align:start position:0%
to um
to

03:21:23.190 --> 03:21:23.200 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:21:25.910 --> 03:21:25.920 align:start position:0%
my if they threaten
 
03:21:28.710 --> 03:21:28.720 align:start position:0%
how many of us have heard kids go i'm
 
03:21:30.229 --> 03:21:30.239 align:start position:0%
gonna kill you
 
03:21:32.870 --> 03:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
how many of us have heard we you know
 
03:21:35.990 --> 03:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
we're in the car and someone cuts us off
 
03:21:38.469 --> 03:21:38.479 align:start position:0%
and we make a threat
 
03:21:41.349 --> 03:21:41.359 align:start position:0%
this bill well if i'm essential if i'm
 
03:21:43.349 --> 03:21:43.359 align:start position:0%
if i'm a bus driver
 
03:21:43.359 --> 03:21:44.469 align:start position:0%
if i'm a bus driver
and

03:21:44.469 --> 03:21:44.479 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:21:46.309 --> 03:21:46.319 align:start position:0%
the passenger goes what are you trying
 
03:21:49.750 --> 03:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
to kill me i'm going to kill you
 
03:21:50.830 --> 03:21:50.840 align:start position:0%
that would
 
03:21:55.990 --> 03:21:56.000 align:start position:0%
cause a potential for a class b felony
 
03:21:58.469 --> 03:21:58.479 align:start position:0%
the crime does not
 
03:22:01.830 --> 03:22:01.840 align:start position:0%
does not fit the does not fit the um
 
03:22:04.309 --> 03:22:04.319 align:start position:0%
the offense so that's the other part of
 
03:22:07.510 --> 03:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
this that i have in opposing it
 
03:22:10.150 --> 03:22:10.160 align:start position:0%
like i said i certainly am not opposed
 
03:22:14.070 --> 03:22:14.080 align:start position:0%
to um anybody's human rights not to be
 
03:22:16.150 --> 03:22:16.160 align:start position:0%
attacked because of their beliefs
 
03:22:18.150 --> 03:22:18.160 align:start position:0%
because of their religion for
 
03:22:20.550 --> 03:22:20.560 align:start position:0%
discrimination is discrimination it has
 
03:22:22.870 --> 03:22:22.880 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with masking and unmasking
 
03:22:25.349 --> 03:22:25.359 align:start position:0%
it has nothing to do with you know
 
03:22:27.910 --> 03:22:27.920 align:start position:0%
our policy if it's a policy no shirt no
 
03:22:30.309 --> 03:22:30.319 align:start position:0%
shoes no service that's the policy of
 
03:22:32.550 --> 03:22:32.560 align:start position:0%
the store if someone wants to get in
 
03:22:35.110 --> 03:22:35.120 align:start position:0%
your face about that policy then you
 
03:22:36.790 --> 03:22:36.800 align:start position:0%
take the appropriate action you call the
 
03:22:38.710 --> 03:22:38.720 align:start position:0%
police and the police will
 
03:22:40.469 --> 03:22:40.479 align:start position:0%
manage the situation
 
03:22:43.990 --> 03:22:44.000 align:start position:0%
we have in this pandemic we have created
 
03:22:46.070 --> 03:22:46.080 align:start position:0%

03:22:46.080 --> 03:22:47.269 align:start position:0%

04:59:39.830 --> 04:59:39.840 align:start position:0%
put in that position
 
04:59:41.030 --> 04:59:41.040 align:start position:0%
you know i don't care what side of the
 
04:59:42.628 --> 04:59:42.638 align:start position:0%
fence you're on
 
04:59:45.270 --> 04:59:45.280 align:start position:0%
but i just look at it as
 
04:59:48.310 --> 04:59:48.320 align:start position:0%
you know we have current laws now
 
04:59:50.788 --> 04:59:50.798 align:start position:0%
and like the gentleman said that was bit
 
04:59:53.030 --> 04:59:53.040 align:start position:0%
um you know she's facing four
 
04:59:53.040 --> 04:59:56.390 align:start position:0%
um you know she's facing four
misdemeanors

04:59:56.390 --> 04:59:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:59.590 --> 04:59:59.600 align:start position:0%
you know so i think the the law works
 
05:00:02.470 --> 05:00:02.480 align:start position:0%
but to carve out
 
05:00:05.030 --> 05:00:05.040 align:start position:0%
you know essential workers and i have a
 
05:00:07.510 --> 05:00:07.520 align:start position:0%
bunch of nurses in my family my wife
 
05:00:09.750 --> 05:00:09.760 align:start position:0%
uh kids and um
 
05:00:12.948 --> 05:00:12.958 align:start position:0%
many nurse friends that my wife has
 
05:00:14.310 --> 05:00:14.320 align:start position:0%
and they were
 
05:00:15.990 --> 05:00:16.000 align:start position:0%
looking at this bill saying that they
 
05:00:17.430 --> 05:00:17.440 align:start position:0%
don't want anything special they just
 
05:00:19.430 --> 05:00:19.440 align:start position:0%
want to be protected
 
05:00:22.708 --> 05:00:22.718 align:start position:0%
under current law if something happens
 
05:00:24.150 --> 05:00:24.160 align:start position:0%
you know because we shouldn't be carving
 
05:00:25.670 --> 05:00:25.680 align:start position:0%
out different things
 
05:00:27.510 --> 05:00:27.520 align:start position:0%
you know i know sadly we do in other
 
05:00:27.520 --> 05:00:29.190 align:start position:0%
you know i know sadly we do in other
areas

05:00:29.190 --> 05:00:29.200 align:start position:0%

cutoff or is it two
 
05:02:24.788 --> 05:02:24.798 align:start position:0%
my understanding that you could it can

be put on consent with three you
 
05:02:27.670 --> 05:02:27.680 align:start position:0%

representative green
 
05:06:32.070 --> 05:06:32.080 align:start position:0%
i think it was the last session there
 
05:06:34.628 --> 05:06:34.638 align:start position:0%
was built either that or something very
 
05:06:36.788 --> 05:06:36.798 align:start position:0%
similar to it that we had
 
05:06:43.430 --> 05:06:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:45.750 --> 05:06:45.760 align:start position:0%

the uh
 
05:07:12.868 --> 05:07:12.878 align:start position:0%
after coving maybe that might have been
 
05:07:14.628 --> 05:07:14.638 align:start position:0%
the problem it was in an omnibus bill or
 
05:07:16.070 --> 05:07:16.080 align:start position:0%
something like that i don't know i
 
05:07:17.750 --> 05:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
assume it was that
 
05:07:20.230 --> 05:07:20.240 align:start position:0%
i i just was trying to figure it out but
 
05:07:21.990 --> 05:07:22.000 align:start position:0%
but it did pass the committee i think is
 
05:07:23.350 --> 05:07:23.360 align:start position:0%

05:08:13.670 --> 05:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
make a motion
 
05:08:13.680 --> 05:08:14.830 align:start position:0%
make a motion
so

05:08:14.830 --> 05:08:14.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:08:17.430 --> 05:08:17.440 align:start position:0%
just my apologies i thought i was
 
05:08:17.440 --> 05:08:19.430 align:start position:0%
just my apologies i thought i was
recognized

05:08:19.430 --> 05:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
recognized
 
05:08:22.230 --> 05:08:22.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:23.830 --> 05:08:23.840 align:start position:0%
could you just you were recognized for
 
05:08:25.110 --> 05:08:25.120 align:start position:0%
your point please state your point of
 
05:08:28.948 --> 05:08:28.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:32.230 --> 05:08:32.240 align:start position:0%
we can you repeat
 
05:08:34.708 --> 05:08:34.718 align:start position:0%
can you just repeat what the response
 
05:08:37.350 --> 05:08:37.360 align:start position:0%
was i did that that is
 
05:08:40.070 --> 05:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
that is not a point of order if i say
 
05:08:42.628 --> 05:08:42.638 align:start position:0%
something that you do not hear
 
05:08:43.670 --> 05:08:43.680 align:start position:0%
and you you
 
05:08:45.590 --> 05:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
at any time anyone on the commit please
 
05:08:48.628 --> 05:08:48.638 align:start position:0%
ask me to repeat whatever i said
 
05:08:50.708 --> 05:08:50.718 align:start position:0%
but asking me that's not a point of
 
05:08:53.990 --> 05:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
order just to clarify a point of order
 
05:08:56.868 --> 05:08:56.878 align:start position:0%
is when there's a rule
 
05:08:59.590 --> 05:08:59.600 align:start position:0%
that is not being followed by the chair
 
05:09:00.948 --> 05:09:00.958 align:start position:0%
of the committee
 
05:09:02.868 --> 05:09:02.878 align:start position:0%
and therefore you are basically stating
 
05:09:04.948 --> 05:09:04.958 align:start position:0%
an objection for not following that rule
 
05:09:06.550 --> 05:09:06.560 align:start position:0%
so that's
 
05:09:08.708 --> 05:09:08.718 align:start position:0%
not a valid point of order
 
05:09:11.510 --> 05:09:11.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair may i ask a question
 
05:09:13.190 --> 05:09:13.200 align:start position:0%
and should i preface it as a
 
05:09:15.430 --> 05:09:15.440 align:start position:0%
parliamentary inquiry i'm not quite sure
 
05:09:17.750 --> 05:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
how to be recognized properly
 
05:09:19.590 --> 05:09:19.600 align:start position:0%
you you have a question you you're
 
05:09:21.750 --> 05:09:21.760 align:start position:0%
recognized for a parliamentary inquiry
 
05:09:24.070 --> 05:09:24.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:09:25.990 --> 05:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
here's a question could would you please
 
05:09:28.390 --> 05:09:28.400 align:start position:0%
could you please repeat what your ruling
 
05:09:30.628 --> 05:09:30.638 align:start position:0%
was on the point of order is that an
 
05:09:34.230 --> 05:09:34.240 align:start position:0%
appropriate question i did not hear it
 
05:09:36.150 --> 05:09:36.160 align:start position:0%
in regards to your point of order it was
 
05:09:39.190 --> 05:09:39.200 align:start position:0%
not a valid point of order because you
 
05:09:41.590 --> 05:09:41.600 align:start position:0%
were basically said you did not hear
 
05:09:43.750 --> 05:09:43.760 align:start position:0%
what i said so that is not a point of
 
05:09:45.510 --> 05:09:45.520 align:start position:0%
vote there's no rule violation that i'm
 
05:09:46.868 --> 05:09:46.878 align:start position:0%
aware of
 
05:09:49.350 --> 05:09:49.360 align:start position:0%
and if you can reference one then
 
05:09:50.868 --> 05:09:50.878 align:start position:0%
that's the ruling
 
05:09:52.070 --> 05:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
so you're free to challenge the ruling
 
05:09:53.910 --> 05:09:53.920 align:start position:0%
of the chair but that's the ruling i
 
05:09:53.920 --> 05:09:54.708 align:start position:0%
of the chair but that's the ruling i
made

05:09:54.708 --> 05:09:54.718 align:start position:0%
made
 
05:09:56.788 --> 05:09:56.798 align:start position:0%
i have no no intention to
 
05:09:58.150 --> 05:09:58.160 align:start position:0%
challenge the ruling of the chair all i
 
05:10:00.470 --> 05:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
want to ask in whatever manner is
 
05:10:02.070 --> 05:10:02.080 align:start position:0%
appropriate whether you could please
 
05:10:02.080 --> 05:10:03.350 align:start position:0%
appropriate whether you could please
repeat

05:10:03.350 --> 05:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
repeat
 
05:10:05.350 --> 05:10:05.360 align:start position:0%
what you said to the representative when
 
05:10:06.708 --> 05:10:06.718 align:start position:0%
you were
 
05:10:09.430 --> 05:10:09.440 align:start position:0%
discussing her motion okay
 
05:10:10.628 --> 05:10:10.638 align:start position:0%
uh two things
 
05:10:11.910 --> 05:10:11.920 align:start position:0%
the representative is not recognized to
 
05:10:14.550 --> 05:10:14.560 align:start position:0%
make a motion number one number two
 
05:10:16.550 --> 05:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
and specifically a substitute is not
 
05:10:18.948 --> 05:10:18.958 align:start position:0%
allowed to make a motion or
 
05:10:21.110 --> 05:10:21.120 align:start position:0%
second the motion so even if i did
 
05:10:23.030 --> 05:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
recognize the representative to make a
 
05:10:24.628 --> 05:10:24.638 align:start position:0%
motion which i didn't
 
05:10:26.550 --> 05:10:26.560 align:start position:0%
it would be out of order for that member
 
05:10:28.628 --> 05:10:28.638 align:start position:0%
to make a motion
 
05:10:29.910 --> 05:10:29.920 align:start position:0%
so therefore
 
05:10:31.510 --> 05:10:31.520 align:start position:0%
which when i acknowledged the
 
05:10:33.030 --> 05:10:33.040 align:start position:0%
representative i assumed it was for
 
05:10:35.510 --> 05:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
anything but making a motion
 
05:10:35.520 --> 05:10:36.788 align:start position:0%
anything but making a motion
and

05:10:36.788 --> 05:10:36.798 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:10:39.190 --> 05:10:39.200 align:start position:0%
that that's it it was that's the ruling
 
05:10:40.550 --> 05:10:40.560 align:start position:0%
that i made
 
05:10:41.510 --> 05:10:41.520 align:start position:0%
and we're going to move on from the
 
05:10:41.520 --> 05:10:42.788 align:start position:0%
and we're going to move on from the
discussion

05:10:42.788 --> 05:10:42.798 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
05:10:44.230 --> 05:10:44.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:10:50.310 --> 05:10:50.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:52.628 --> 05:10:52.638 align:start position:0%
do you wish to be recognized to make a
 
05:10:52.638 --> 05:10:57.990 align:start position:0%
do you wish to be recognized to make a
motion

05:10:57.990 --> 05:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:00.550 --> 05:11:00.560 align:start position:0%
yes i would uh move
 
05:11:02.708 --> 05:11:02.718 align:start position:0%
that hp
 
05:11:06.150 --> 05:11:06.160 align:start position:0%
12 excuse me 11 27 be
 
05:11:11.510 --> 05:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:15.990 --> 05:11:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:17.910 --> 05:11:17.920 align:start position:0%
thank you that has been seconded by
 
05:11:19.510 --> 05:11:19.520 align:start position:0%
representative byrd
 
05:11:21.430 --> 05:11:21.440 align:start position:0%
do you representative roy do you wish to
 
05:11:24.070 --> 05:11:24.080 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion
 
05:11:27.510 --> 05:11:27.520 align:start position:0%
yes just shortly um the the the
 
05:11:29.830 --> 05:11:29.840 align:start position:0%
preliminary powers of the governor
 
05:11:32.550 --> 05:11:32.560 align:start position:0%
to pardon even posthumously
 
05:11:34.708 --> 05:11:34.718 align:start position:0%
exist currently there are also remedies
 
05:11:36.948 --> 05:11:36.958 align:start position:0%
within the court to have
 
05:11:40.550 --> 05:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
convictions set aside or reversed
 
05:11:42.070 --> 05:11:42.080 align:start position:0%
this is not
 
05:11:44.310 --> 05:11:44.320 align:start position:0%
a legislative act
 
05:11:46.070 --> 05:11:46.080 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't the legislatures not be
 
05:11:47.430 --> 05:11:47.440 align:start position:0%
getting into
 
05:11:49.670 --> 05:11:49.680 align:start position:0%
specific people who we should find not
 
05:11:51.670 --> 05:11:51.680 align:start position:0%
guilty posthumously
 
05:11:53.430 --> 05:11:53.440 align:start position:0%
um it it's
 
05:11:56.390 --> 05:11:56.400 align:start position:0%
it leads us down a road of political
 
05:11:58.708 --> 05:11:58.718 align:start position:0%
political acts that infringe upon the
 
05:12:01.270 --> 05:12:01.280 align:start position:0%
executive or the judicial branch these
 
05:12:01.280 --> 05:12:02.470 align:start position:0%
executive or the judicial branch these
these

05:12:02.470 --> 05:12:02.480 align:start position:0%
these
 
05:12:03.830 --> 05:12:03.840 align:start position:0%
things that are requested in this bill
 
05:12:05.590 --> 05:12:05.600 align:start position:0%
are already available
 
05:12:07.830 --> 05:12:07.840 align:start position:0%
to anyone to petition to the governor or
 
05:12:09.110 --> 05:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
the courts
 
05:12:10.868 --> 05:12:10.878 align:start position:0%
so therefore i move in expedient to
 
05:12:10.878 --> 05:12:22.628 align:start position:0%
so therefore i move in expedient to
legislate

05:12:22.628 --> 05:12:22.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:24.628 --> 05:12:24.638 align:start position:0%
representative tessman
 
05:12:24.638 --> 05:12:25.670 align:start position:0%
representative tessman
uh

05:12:25.670 --> 05:12:25.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:12:26.830 --> 05:12:26.840 align:start position:0%
just a
 
05:12:30.550 --> 05:12:30.560 align:start position:0%
question how did it pass
 
05:12:32.310 --> 05:12:32.320 align:start position:0%
last year
 
05:12:33.590 --> 05:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
if it
 
05:12:35.590 --> 05:12:35.600 align:start position:0%
isn't rightfully
 
05:12:38.150 --> 05:12:38.160 align:start position:0%
something we should have passed
 
05:12:40.550 --> 05:12:40.560 align:start position:0%
and got laid he got cleared of being
 
05:12:46.070 --> 05:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:47.430 --> 05:12:47.440 align:start position:0%
can i ask the committee researcher what
 
05:12:57.830 --> 05:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:59.750 --> 05:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
i don't know what what the roll call was
 
05:13:00.788 --> 05:13:00.798 align:start position:0%
i don't
 
05:13:03.190 --> 05:13:03.200 align:start position:0%
i don't have that information with me so
 
05:13:04.390 --> 05:13:04.400 align:start position:0%
i don't know
 
05:13:06.150 --> 05:13:06.160 align:start position:0%
how it
 
05:13:06.160 --> 05:13:07.030 align:start position:0%
how it
it

05:13:07.030 --> 05:13:07.040 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:13:09.590 --> 05:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
it did that's that's the record
 
05:13:12.550 --> 05:13:12.560 align:start position:0%
that it is it passed in the committee or
 
05:13:13.910 --> 05:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
whatever it did in the community it was
 
05:13:15.510 --> 05:13:15.520 align:start position:0%
what it was it passed in the house last
 
05:13:15.520 --> 05:13:33.830 align:start position:0%
what it was it passed in the house last
term

05:13:33.830 --> 05:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:37.990 --> 05:13:38.000 align:start position:0%
i think that's a mistake of the clerk
 
05:13:41.910 --> 05:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:46.150 --> 05:13:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:49.830 --> 05:13:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:52.788 --> 05:13:52.798 align:start position:0%
last term had passed but according to
 
05:13:54.310 --> 05:13:54.320 align:start position:0%
the the
 
05:13:58.230 --> 05:13:58.240 align:start position:0%
the vote that was recorded by
 
05:14:00.390 --> 05:14:00.400 align:start position:0%
harry gathright representative testman
 
05:14:02.470 --> 05:14:02.480 align:start position:0%
you and i both apparently support it i'm
 
05:14:07.750 --> 05:14:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:16.070 --> 05:14:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:17.990 --> 05:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
that's just just that's just that's just
 
05:14:19.830 --> 05:14:19.840 align:start position:0%
the facts it won't be the first time
 
05:14:21.350 --> 05:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
there's been a mistake in the recording
 
05:14:21.360 --> 05:14:22.150 align:start position:0%
there's been a mistake in the recording
but

05:14:22.150 --> 05:14:22.160 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:14:24.070 --> 05:14:24.080 align:start position:0%
that's what it says
 
05:14:26.390 --> 05:14:26.400 align:start position:0%
representative connolly
 
05:14:27.590 --> 05:14:27.600 align:start position:0%
thanks for making me look that up by the
 
05:14:27.600 --> 05:14:29.270 align:start position:0%
thanks for making me look that up by the
way

05:14:29.270 --> 05:14:29.280 align:start position:0%
way
 
05:14:31.190 --> 05:14:31.200 align:start position:0%
mr chairman committee members i did a
 
05:14:33.270 --> 05:14:33.280 align:start position:0%
tremendous disservice to the
 
05:14:35.190 --> 05:14:35.200 align:start position:0%
sponsor of this bill
 
05:14:37.910 --> 05:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
by not being prepared to discuss it
 
05:14:39.830 --> 05:14:39.840 align:start position:0%
and for that i'm sorry
 
05:14:41.750 --> 05:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
so what we just learned is that this
 
05:14:44.150 --> 05:14:44.160 align:start position:0%
came through this very committee
 
05:14:46.150 --> 05:14:46.160 align:start position:0%
two years ago
 
05:14:48.550 --> 05:14:48.560 align:start position:0%
and passed on consent
 
05:14:50.470 --> 05:14:50.480 align:start position:0%
we know the sponsor of this bill
 
05:14:53.990 --> 05:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
everyone in this room knows the sponsor
 
05:14:56.070 --> 05:14:56.080 align:start position:0%
knows how he
 
05:14:57.910 --> 05:14:57.920 align:start position:0%
the way he comports himself the way he
 
05:15:00.310 --> 05:15:00.320 align:start position:0%
prepares himself with legislation
 
05:15:02.550 --> 05:15:02.560 align:start position:0%
what this is clearly trying to do
 
05:15:03.830 --> 05:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
is a sim
 
05:15:05.910 --> 05:15:05.920 align:start position:0%
make a symbolic gesture
 
05:15:07.590 --> 05:15:07.600 align:start position:0%
to address two
 
05:15:09.750 --> 05:15:09.760 align:start position:0%
uh high-profile
 
05:15:11.590 --> 05:15:11.600 align:start position:0%
instances uh in which there was a
 
05:15:13.510 --> 05:15:13.520 align:start position:0%
miscarriage of justice
 
05:15:15.590 --> 05:15:15.600 align:start position:0%
there are paths where this could be done
 
05:15:17.750 --> 05:15:17.760 align:start position:0%
currently in law
 
05:15:17.760 --> 05:15:18.470 align:start position:0%
currently in law
but

05:15:18.470 --> 05:15:18.480 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:15:20.390 --> 05:15:20.400 align:start position:0%
i don't think i think this is quite
 
05:15:22.628 --> 05:15:22.638 align:start position:0%
clearly meant
 
05:15:25.830 --> 05:15:25.840 align:start position:0%
to be done as a symbolic move
 
05:15:27.190 --> 05:15:27.200 align:start position:0%
i believe if it passed this committee
 
05:15:30.390 --> 05:15:30.400 align:start position:0%
once it should pass again despite
 
05:15:33.030 --> 05:15:33.040 align:start position:0%
the uh poor introduction and uh
 
05:15:37.430 --> 05:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:39.030 --> 05:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
can you
 
05:15:40.550 --> 05:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
and this is a question for this anyone
 
05:15:43.110 --> 05:15:43.120 align:start position:0%
in the room can you actually an annul a
 
05:15:43.120 --> 05:15:45.510 align:start position:0%
in the room can you actually an annul a
rest

05:15:45.510 --> 05:15:45.520 align:start position:0%
rest
 
05:15:49.430 --> 05:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:51.670 --> 05:15:51.680 align:start position:0%
you can know the the conviction but i
 
05:15:51.680 --> 05:15:56.550 align:start position:0%
you can know the the conviction but i
guess

05:15:56.550 --> 05:15:56.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:58.230 --> 05:15:58.240 align:start position:0%
because this this came up on another i'm
 
05:16:00.868 --> 05:16:00.878 align:start position:0%
just i'm just throwing out there that
 
05:16:02.550 --> 05:16:02.560 align:start position:0%
when you named two individuals
 
05:16:04.070 --> 05:16:04.080 align:start position:0%
specifically by name and i'm not saying
 
05:16:05.750 --> 05:16:05.760 align:start position:0%
that they're not worthy of annulments or
 
05:16:07.910 --> 05:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
they're not worthy i'm not
 
05:16:09.430 --> 05:16:09.440 align:start position:0%
taking a position on that
 
05:16:12.550 --> 05:16:12.560 align:start position:0%
but does the legislator
 
05:16:14.788 --> 05:16:14.798 align:start position:0%
have the authority for those two and can
 
05:16:16.470 --> 05:16:16.480 align:start position:0%
we even do are we allowed permitted to
 
05:16:22.310 --> 05:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:24.310 --> 05:16:24.320 align:start position:0%
representative roy then president pratt
 
05:16:25.990 --> 05:16:26.000 align:start position:0%
then represented wall
 
05:16:26.000 --> 05:16:26.708 align:start position:0%
then represented wall
and

05:16:26.708 --> 05:16:26.718 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:16:28.230 --> 05:16:28.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and i think that
 
05:16:30.470 --> 05:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
goes directly to my point it's it's a
 
05:16:33.670 --> 05:16:33.680 align:start position:0%
separation of powers issue if if we if
 
05:16:35.830 --> 05:16:35.840 align:start position:0%
the court right or wrong in this case
 
05:16:37.190 --> 05:16:37.200 align:start position:0%
clearly wrong
 
05:16:39.110 --> 05:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
makes makes a decision
 
05:16:40.788 --> 05:16:40.798 align:start position:0%
it's upon the court to reverse its
 
05:16:43.190 --> 05:16:43.200 align:start position:0%
decision not upon the legislature to to
 
05:16:46.788 --> 05:16:46.798 align:start position:0%
go retroactively and and reverse it so i
 
05:16:48.390 --> 05:16:48.400 align:start position:0%
that's my point i don't think we have
 
05:16:50.230 --> 05:16:50.240 align:start position:0%
that power well i think you can annul a
 
05:16:52.150 --> 05:16:52.160 align:start position:0%
conviction like if you have a conviction
 
05:16:53.670 --> 05:16:53.680 align:start position:0%
of cannabis
 
05:16:54.948 --> 05:16:54.958 align:start position:0%
if it's under three possession on the
 
05:16:56.230 --> 05:16:56.240 align:start position:0%
three quarters of an ounce you can get
 
05:16:58.788 --> 05:16:58.798 align:start position:0%
the conviction unknown you can do it but
 
05:17:01.110 --> 05:17:01.120 align:start position:0%
i'm saying this is identifying a
 
05:17:03.510 --> 05:17:03.520 align:start position:0%
particular person yeah but by the court
 
05:17:05.270 --> 05:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
not by the legislature you still have to
 
05:17:07.110 --> 05:17:07.120 align:start position:0%
go into court and do and do it and get
 
05:17:08.550 --> 05:17:08.560 align:start position:0%
it approved
 
05:17:10.708 --> 05:17:10.718 align:start position:0%
is an annulment process
 
05:17:12.310 --> 05:17:12.320 align:start position:0%
so i'm just saying paragraph two and
 
05:17:17.670 --> 05:17:17.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:19.670 --> 05:17:19.680 align:start position:0%
representative pratt
 
05:17:21.750 --> 05:17:21.760 align:start position:0%
uh in the case of
 
05:17:25.830 --> 05:17:25.840 align:start position:0%
eunice uh in 1938
 
05:17:27.430 --> 05:17:27.440 align:start position:0%
the hampton re-tried that and found him
 
05:17:29.910 --> 05:17:29.920 align:start position:0%
not guilty found her not guilty
 
05:17:31.990 --> 05:17:32.000 align:start position:0%
so that was already retrialed and found
 
05:17:33.430 --> 05:17:33.440 align:start position:0%
not guilty so
 
05:17:41.910 --> 05:17:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:43.990 --> 05:17:44.000 align:start position:0%
it wasn't injustice at the time but they
 
05:17:45.590 --> 05:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
retried it and found him not guilty at
 
05:17:48.150 --> 05:17:48.160 align:start position:0%
that time so we're basically reaffirming
 
05:17:50.070 --> 05:17:50.080 align:start position:0%
what's already been done i guess why
 
05:17:54.310 --> 05:17:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:59.110 --> 05:17:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:02.788 --> 05:18:02.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:04.070 --> 05:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
is this
 
05:18:06.390 --> 05:18:06.400 align:start position:0%
thank you um first i want to apologize
 
05:18:09.190 --> 05:18:09.200 align:start position:0%
to the chair i'm sorry i did not
 
05:18:11.750 --> 05:18:11.760 align:start position:0%

05:18:13.750 --> 05:18:13.760 align:start position:0%
being able to make a motion so i
 
05:18:16.550 --> 05:18:16.560 align:start position:0%

this bill
um

05:18:25.030 --> 05:18:25.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:18:27.110 --> 05:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
i just want to draw the attention to the
 
05:18:29.430 --> 05:18:29.440 align:start position:0%
committee that um
 
05:18:31.990 --> 05:18:32.000 align:start position:0%
the bill is not asking to annul the
 
05:18:35.270 --> 05:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
arrests of willard uphouse
 
05:18:38.230 --> 05:18:38.240 align:start position:0%
and eunice goody cole in fact what it is
 
05:18:39.990 --> 05:18:40.000 align:start position:0%
asked what it is saying
 
05:18:41.990 --> 05:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
is that the activities
 
05:18:44.470 --> 05:18:44.480 align:start position:0%
the subversive activities act
 
05:18:47.110 --> 05:18:47.120 align:start position:0%
that willard uphouse was convicted and
 
05:18:51.110 --> 05:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
imprisoned on was a manifest injustice
 
05:18:53.030 --> 05:18:53.040 align:start position:0%
and this act
 
05:18:55.110 --> 05:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
this bill we are considering
 
05:18:57.670 --> 05:18:57.680 align:start position:0%
corrects that historical error and
 
05:19:00.550 --> 05:19:00.560 align:start position:0%
exonerates willard uphouse and annuls
 
05:19:02.310 --> 05:19:02.320 align:start position:0%
his conviction
 
05:19:05.830 --> 05:19:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:07.990 --> 05:19:08.000 align:start position:0%
the the second part of this
 
05:19:08.000 --> 05:19:09.190 align:start position:0%
the the second part of this
proposal

05:19:09.190 --> 05:19:09.200 align:start position:0%
proposal
 
05:19:10.628 --> 05:19:10.638 align:start position:0%
is that
 
05:19:13.750 --> 05:19:13.760 align:start position:0%
the legislator finds legislature we find
 
05:19:16.310 --> 05:19:16.320 align:start position:0%
that the arrest convictions floggings
 
05:19:18.788 --> 05:19:18.798 align:start position:0%
and imprisonment of eunice goody coal
 
05:19:21.510 --> 05:19:21.520 align:start position:0%
for witchcraft and familiarity with the
 
05:19:21.520 --> 05:19:22.390 align:start position:0%
for witchcraft and familiarity with the
devil

05:19:22.390 --> 05:19:22.400 align:start position:0%
devil
 
05:19:25.670 --> 05:19:25.680 align:start position:0%
was a manifest injustice and this act
 
05:19:28.868 --> 05:19:28.878 align:start position:0%
corrects historical error and exonerates
 
05:19:31.270 --> 05:19:31.280 align:start position:0%
eunice goody cole and annuls her
 
05:19:33.910 --> 05:19:33.920 align:start position:0%
convictions so we're not asking to annul
 
05:19:37.750 --> 05:19:37.760 align:start position:0%
anyone's arrest we're asking
 
05:19:37.760 --> 05:19:39.430 align:start position:0%
anyone's arrest we're asking
representative

05:19:39.430 --> 05:19:39.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:19:39.440 --> 05:19:40.390 align:start position:0%
representative
cushing

05:19:40.390 --> 05:19:40.400 align:start position:0%
cushing
 
05:19:42.788 --> 05:19:42.798 align:start position:0%
is asking to correct a manifest
 
05:19:44.628 --> 05:19:44.638 align:start position:0%
injustice and
 
05:19:44.638 --> 05:19:45.990 align:start position:0%
injustice and
using

05:19:45.990 --> 05:19:46.000 align:start position:0%
using
 
05:19:48.948 --> 05:19:48.958 align:start position:0%
our our power to correct that manifest
 
05:19:51.110 --> 05:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
injustice and also
 
05:19:57.510 --> 05:19:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:57.520 --> 05:19:58.550 align:start position:0%
 
tortured

05:19:58.550 --> 05:19:58.560 align:start position:0%
tortured
 
05:20:00.470 --> 05:20:00.480 align:start position:0%
for witchcraft
 
05:20:05.030 --> 05:20:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:08.070 --> 05:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
imprisoned for
 
05:20:11.110 --> 05:20:11.120 align:start position:0%
subversive actions so um just want to
 
05:20:12.708 --> 05:20:12.718 align:start position:0%
correct that we are not
 
05:20:14.470 --> 05:20:14.480 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
05:20:16.788 --> 05:20:16.798 align:start position:0%
annulling anyone's arrest that's that's
 
05:20:18.550 --> 05:20:18.560 align:start position:0%
not an issue
 
05:20:19.830 --> 05:20:19.840 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
05:20:22.230 --> 05:20:22.240 align:start position:0%
representative pratt
 
05:20:24.708 --> 05:20:24.718 align:start position:0%
the information you had about the
 
05:20:27.110 --> 05:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
conviction that was overturned and then
 
05:20:28.788 --> 05:20:28.798 align:start position:0%
found not guilty
 
05:20:28.798 --> 05:20:30.390 align:start position:0%
found not guilty
online

05:20:30.390 --> 05:20:30.400 align:start position:0%
online
 
05:20:30.400 --> 05:20:31.270 align:start position:0%
online
it

05:20:31.270 --> 05:20:31.280 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:20:34.868 --> 05:20:34.878 align:start position:0%
it's like no official source just online
 
05:20:36.948 --> 05:20:36.958 align:start position:0%
and then the second one there uh was not
 
05:20:38.868 --> 05:20:38.878 align:start position:0%
being charged for subversive activities
 
05:20:41.270 --> 05:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
but was being charged for uh
 
05:20:43.270 --> 05:20:43.280 align:start position:0%
a year in jail was put in jail for a
 
05:20:45.750 --> 05:20:45.760 align:start position:0%
year for not turning over records
 
05:20:47.270 --> 05:20:47.280 align:start position:0%
so that was a crime that was committed
 
05:20:49.510 --> 05:20:49.520 align:start position:0%
even though um
 
05:20:52.548 --> 05:20:52.558 align:start position:0%
that was during the cold war the war
 
05:20:54.788 --> 05:20:54.798 align:start position:0%
between uh the communists and the
 
05:20:57.910 --> 05:20:57.920 align:start position:0%
capitalism and then the korean war so
 
05:21:02.788 --> 05:21:02.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:05.590 --> 05:21:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:07.270 --> 05:21:07.280 align:start position:0%

just to follow on um furthermore the
 
05:21:10.798 --> 05:21:12.230 align:start position:0%

conviction

05:21:12.230 --> 05:21:12.240 align:start position:0%
conviction
 
05:21:12.240 --> 05:21:13.670 align:start position:0%
conviction
of

05:21:13.670 --> 05:21:13.680 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:21:16.548 --> 05:21:16.558 align:start position:0%
of mr up house
 
05:21:18.548 --> 05:21:18.558 align:start position:0%
was upheld it was a federal charge
 
05:21:20.230 --> 05:21:20.240 align:start position:0%

05:21:23.190 --> 05:21:23.200 align:start position:0%
i don't believe the new hampshire
 
05:21:25.830 --> 05:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
legislature has the ability to
 
05:22:02.708 --> 05:22:02.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:02.718 --> 05:22:03.590 align:start position:0%
 
oh

05:22:03.590 --> 05:22:03.600 align:start position:0%

thank you chair um
 
05:22:11.670 --> 05:22:11.680 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm finding it a little troubling
 
05:22:13.430 --> 05:22:13.440 align:start position:0%
that every
 
05:22:15.270 --> 05:22:15.280 align:start position:0%
buddy that was on this committee last
 
05:22:18.150 --> 05:22:18.160 align:start position:0%
year voted for this and not a single
 
05:22:21.030 --> 05:22:21.040 align:start position:0%
representative voted against it
 
05:22:21.040 --> 05:22:22.470 align:start position:0%
representative voted against it
um

05:22:22.470 --> 05:22:22.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:22:22.480 --> 05:22:24.868 align:start position:0%
um
representative

05:22:24.868 --> 05:22:24.878 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:22:27.590 --> 05:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
roy what can you tell explain to us what
 
05:22:28.948 --> 05:22:28.958 align:start position:0%
your first
 
05:22:31.350 --> 05:22:31.360 align:start position:0%
voting decision of yes was
 
05:22:31.360 --> 05:22:33.110 align:start position:0%
voting decision of yes was
sure

05:22:33.110 --> 05:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
sure
 
05:22:35.270 --> 05:22:35.280 align:start position:0%
that was two years ago not one year ago
 
05:22:36.628 --> 05:22:36.638 align:start position:0%
and i
 
05:22:38.470 --> 05:22:38.480 align:start position:0%
don't recall voting i don't know if i
 
05:22:44.230 --> 05:22:44.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:46.628 --> 05:22:46.638 align:start position:0%
and questioning the members of prior
 
05:22:48.150 --> 05:22:48.160 align:start position:0%
voting records members do have the
 
05:22:50.070 --> 05:22:50.080 align:start position:0%
ability to change their minds
 
05:22:52.470 --> 05:22:52.480 align:start position:0%
and i know myself there's been issues
 
05:22:54.628 --> 05:22:54.638 align:start position:0%
that even this year that i
 
05:22:56.708 --> 05:22:56.718 align:start position:0%
have changed my mind on
 
05:22:58.070 --> 05:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
certain things there's a bill that we
 
05:22:59.990 --> 05:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
vote on in this committee actually where
 
05:23:01.750 --> 05:23:01.760 align:start position:0%
i voted one way on the house vote i
 
05:23:02.708 --> 05:23:02.718 align:start position:0%
actually wrote a different way because i
 
05:23:04.548 --> 05:23:04.558 align:start position:0%
was convinced after the fact so it does
 
05:23:06.150 --> 05:23:06.160 align:start position:0%
happen i thought for healthy debate we
 
05:23:08.868 --> 05:23:08.878 align:start position:0%
are allowed to ask why a member has an
 
05:23:11.190 --> 05:23:11.200 align:start position:0%
opinion on or votes a certain way on
 
05:23:13.590 --> 05:23:13.600 align:start position:0%
something and the record does show that
 
05:23:15.670 --> 05:23:15.680 align:start position:0%
um representative roy did vote in favor
 
05:23:18.548 --> 05:23:18.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:20.390 --> 05:23:20.400 align:start position:0%
i i couldn't possibly
 
05:23:22.390 --> 05:23:22.400 align:start position:0%
tell you what i was thinking at the time
 
05:23:26.868 --> 05:23:26.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:26.878 --> 05:23:28.070 align:start position:0%
 
that

05:23:28.070 --> 05:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:23:29.670 --> 05:23:29.680 align:start position:0%
what i've already said
 
05:23:31.990 --> 05:23:32.000 align:start position:0%
stands i really can't speak to what what
 
05:23:34.070 --> 05:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
i did two years ago what the situation
 
05:23:34.080 --> 05:23:40.150 align:start position:0%
i did two years ago what the situation
was

05:23:40.150 --> 05:23:40.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:43.910 --> 05:23:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:45.590 --> 05:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
05:23:48.150 --> 05:23:48.160 align:start position:0%
i wasn't here two years ago but i'm
 
05:23:50.150 --> 05:23:50.160 align:start position:0%
understanding that this passed the
 
05:23:53.270 --> 05:23:53.280 align:start position:0%
committee and was on a consent calendar
 
05:23:55.990 --> 05:23:56.000 align:start position:0%
therefore did this go to the senate and
 
05:23:58.390 --> 05:23:58.400 align:start position:0%
get shot down is that
 
05:24:01.350 --> 05:24:01.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:03.350 --> 05:24:03.360 align:start position:0%
all right
 
05:24:04.708 --> 05:24:04.718 align:start position:0%
first of all we're not supposed to refer
 
05:24:05.910 --> 05:24:05.920 align:start position:0%
to the other
 
05:24:08.628 --> 05:24:08.638 align:start position:0%
party number one but it my understanding
 
05:24:10.788 --> 05:24:10.798 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of bills
 
05:24:12.070 --> 05:24:12.080 align:start position:0%
i can't hear you there was a lot of
 
05:24:12.080 --> 05:24:13.270 align:start position:0%
i can't hear you there was a lot of
bills

05:24:13.270 --> 05:24:13.280 align:start position:0%
bills
 
05:24:13.280 --> 05:24:14.150 align:start position:0%
bills
that

05:24:14.150 --> 05:24:14.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:24:16.070 --> 05:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
went to the other body that were not
 
05:24:17.430 --> 05:24:17.440 align:start position:0%
acted upon
 
05:24:18.868 --> 05:24:18.878 align:start position:0%
and the mere fact that they were not
 
05:24:20.708 --> 05:24:20.718 align:start position:0%
acted upon i wouldn't hold that against
 
05:24:23.350 --> 05:24:23.360 align:start position:0%
the merits of the bill
 
05:24:25.110 --> 05:24:25.120 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you
 
05:24:26.548 --> 05:24:26.558 align:start position:0%
pandemic so
 
05:24:27.910 --> 05:24:27.920 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't i wouldn't use that as a
 
05:24:29.590 --> 05:24:29.600 align:start position:0%
negative one way or another in this just
 
05:24:31.670 --> 05:24:31.680 align:start position:0%
i understand better now thank you
 
05:24:33.590 --> 05:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
representative testament
 
05:24:35.430 --> 05:24:35.440 align:start position:0%
uh just two points
 
05:24:38.548 --> 05:24:38.558 align:start position:0%
one to representative marston's thing
 
05:24:40.150 --> 05:24:40.160 align:start position:0%
if you remember remember
 
05:24:42.628 --> 05:24:42.638 align:start position:0%
we got into a third day
 
05:24:45.910 --> 05:24:45.920 align:start position:0%
uh that we had a lot of bills left left
 
05:24:49.830 --> 05:24:49.840 align:start position:0%
undone or not acted on and we just we
 
05:24:51.350 --> 05:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
tabled them all
 
05:24:53.830 --> 05:24:53.840 align:start position:0%
that's because of the pandemic
 
05:24:56.310 --> 05:24:56.320 align:start position:0%
let me just remind you even though we as
 
05:24:59.430 --> 05:24:59.440 align:start position:0%
a body are remiss and not practicing
 
05:25:01.030 --> 05:25:01.040 align:start position:0%
there's something in the constitution
 
05:25:04.470 --> 05:25:04.480 align:start position:0%
called a remonstrance it allows it
 
05:25:07.670 --> 05:25:07.680 align:start position:0%
allows a person who is wronged or in
 
05:25:08.948 --> 05:25:08.958 align:start position:0%
this case
 
05:25:08.958 --> 05:25:10.070 align:start position:0%
this case
probably

05:25:10.070 --> 05:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
probably
 
05:25:12.070 --> 05:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
do something you know
 
05:25:14.788 --> 05:25:14.798 align:start position:0%
have a person stand in for him
 
05:25:17.030 --> 05:25:17.040 align:start position:0%
to come before the general court and we
 
05:25:19.030 --> 05:25:19.040 align:start position:0%
were we used to be
 
05:25:20.788 --> 05:25:20.798 align:start position:0%
even though we don't we violate the
 
05:25:23.590 --> 05:25:23.600 align:start position:0%
constitution we used to be where people
 
05:25:26.230 --> 05:25:26.240 align:start position:0%
would come saying i have tried
 
05:25:28.310 --> 05:25:28.320 align:start position:0%
everything else
 
05:25:30.788 --> 05:25:30.798 align:start position:0%
all these other bodies are not taking
 
05:25:33.750 --> 05:25:33.760 align:start position:0%
you know not taking heed of me and i
 
05:25:35.270 --> 05:25:35.280 align:start position:0%
would like you to
 
05:25:36.948 --> 05:25:36.958 align:start position:0%
abc or d
 
05:25:39.510 --> 05:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
and that was a legitimate thing
 
05:25:42.070 --> 05:25:42.080 align:start position:0%
the current speaker and several others
 
05:25:46.230 --> 05:25:46.240 align:start position:0%
are being sued right now by a
 
05:25:47.910 --> 05:25:47.920 align:start position:0%
a constituent
 
05:25:49.350 --> 05:25:49.360 align:start position:0%
for not
 
05:25:51.110 --> 05:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
upholding those so
 
05:25:52.150 --> 05:25:52.160 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:25:54.150 --> 05:25:54.160 align:start position:0%
we're not practicing it now but there is
 
05:25:55.510 --> 05:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
a way
 
05:25:58.788 --> 05:25:58.798 align:start position:0%
for a person to come before the court
 
05:26:01.590 --> 05:26:01.600 align:start position:0%
and i don't know how you do it but we it
 
05:26:03.270 --> 05:26:03.280 align:start position:0%
might have been you know this would it
 
05:26:04.868 --> 05:26:04.878 align:start position:0%
would it wouldn't have been what renny
 
05:26:07.110 --> 05:26:07.120 align:start position:0%
was doing
 
05:26:08.708 --> 05:26:08.718 align:start position:0%
we got to refer to him as the our friend
 
05:26:12.830 --> 05:26:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:15.030 --> 05:26:15.040 align:start position:0%
uh i
 
05:26:17.030 --> 05:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
i guess i'm looking at it if anyone has
 
05:26:19.270 --> 05:26:19.280 align:start position:0%
been convicted of uh
 
05:26:19.280 --> 05:26:21.590 align:start position:0%
been convicted of uh
witchcraft

05:26:21.590 --> 05:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
witchcraft
 
05:26:23.030 --> 05:26:23.040 align:start position:0%
i mean wouldn't it
 
05:26:24.628 --> 05:26:24.638 align:start position:0%
i understand that in this situation
 
05:26:24.638 --> 05:26:26.310 align:start position:0%
i understand that in this situation
involving

05:26:26.310 --> 05:26:26.320 align:start position:0%
involving
 
05:26:26.320 --> 05:26:27.430 align:start position:0%
involving
um

05:26:27.430 --> 05:26:27.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:26:28.390 --> 05:26:28.400 align:start position:0%
this particular
 
05:26:29.910 --> 05:26:29.920 align:start position:0%
person identified in the bill was a
 
05:26:32.150 --> 05:26:32.160 align:start position:0%
horrible situation but i would say any
 
05:26:33.750 --> 05:26:33.760 align:start position:0%
person convicted of witchcraft would be
 
05:26:35.750 --> 05:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
worthy of annulment
 
05:26:37.190 --> 05:26:37.200 align:start position:0%
which we can do that i'm just saying by
 
05:26:40.310 --> 05:26:40.320 align:start position:0%
individually identifying a single person
 
05:26:41.110 --> 05:26:41.120 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
05:26:42.470 --> 05:26:42.480 align:start position:0%
is his wish
 
05:26:43.910 --> 05:26:43.920 align:start position:0%
it came to a massive is witchcraft still
 
05:26:45.270 --> 05:26:45.280 align:start position:0%
a crime under new hampshire law does
 
05:26:53.110 --> 05:26:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:55.030 --> 05:26:55.040 align:start position:0%
well we wouldn't be able to know a and
 
05:26:57.030 --> 05:26:57.040 align:start position:0%
not making granted pass law and not
 
05:26:58.548 --> 05:26:58.558 align:start position:0%
making an annulment for one person you
 
05:27:01.270 --> 05:27:01.280 align:start position:0%
could do it for
 
05:27:02.948 --> 05:27:02.958 align:start position:0%
i mean we've done it for cannabis last
 
05:27:02.958 --> 05:27:04.390 align:start position:0%
i mean we've done it for cannabis last
term

05:27:04.390 --> 05:27:04.400 align:start position:0%
term
 
05:27:04.400 --> 05:27:05.510 align:start position:0%
term
but

05:27:05.510 --> 05:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:27:08.150 --> 05:27:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:10.150 --> 05:27:10.160 align:start position:0%
no it's not i'm just putting that out
 
05:27:10.160 --> 05:27:17.110 align:start position:0%
no it's not i'm just putting that out
there

05:27:17.110 --> 05:27:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:18.548 --> 05:27:18.558 align:start position:0%
representative pratt
 
05:27:21.910 --> 05:27:21.920 align:start position:0%
not to play this any longer but um
 
05:27:23.670 --> 05:27:23.680 align:start position:0%
that was a we were part of massachusetts
 
05:27:24.788 --> 05:27:24.798 align:start position:0%
when that happened it was against the
 
05:27:26.548 --> 05:27:26.558 align:start position:0%
law in massachusetts
 
05:27:28.868 --> 05:27:28.878 align:start position:0%
and the area this happened was the area
 
05:27:30.230 --> 05:27:30.240 align:start position:0%
of land that this happened in hampton
 
05:27:31.590 --> 05:27:31.600 align:start position:0%
was part of massachusetts at the time i
 
05:27:32.868 --> 05:27:32.878 align:start position:0%
think this happened
 
05:27:34.390 --> 05:27:34.400 align:start position:0%
so it was a massachusetts law that was
 
05:27:35.990 --> 05:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
against the law to be witchcraft i took
 
05:27:47.110 --> 05:27:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:48.470 --> 05:27:48.480 align:start position:0%
it's mind me asking the source of that
 
05:28:07.990 --> 05:28:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:13.990 --> 05:28:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:15.750 --> 05:28:15.760 align:start position:0%
you're recognized for your parliamentary

05:28:42.150 --> 05:28:42.160 align:start position:0%

05:28:58.708 --> 05:28:58.718 align:start position:0%

05:29:00.948 --> 05:29:00.958 align:start position:0%
currently not in the voting mode we are
 
05:29:00.958 --> 05:29:02.470 align:start position:0%
currently not in the voting mode we are
debating

05:29:02.470 --> 05:29:02.480 align:start position:0%
debating
 
05:29:04.390 --> 05:29:04.400 align:start position:0%
the topic and i would say having a
 
05:29:06.390 --> 05:29:06.400 align:start position:0%
healthy discussion
 
05:29:08.708 --> 05:29:08.718 align:start position:0%
doing so so i don't
 
05:29:10.788 --> 05:29:10.798 align:start position:0%
thank you very much i i misunders i i
 
05:29:12.390 --> 05:29:12.400 align:start position:0%
did i thought you had called a motion
 
05:29:16.948 --> 05:29:16.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:17.670 --> 05:29:17.680 align:start position:0%
representative roy you have a
 
05:29:19.670 --> 05:29:19.680 align:start position:0%
parliamentary inquiry
 
05:29:21.110 --> 05:29:21.120 align:start position:0%
something like that
 
05:29:24.470 --> 05:29:24.480 align:start position:0%
could we possibly um
 
05:29:27.430 --> 05:29:27.440 align:start position:0%
change this to a concurrent resolution
 
05:29:29.350 --> 05:29:29.360 align:start position:0%
where we by
 
05:29:31.190 --> 05:29:31.200 align:start position:0%
resolve that
 
05:29:33.190 --> 05:29:33.200 align:start position:0%
in the opinion of the legislature this
 
05:29:33.200 --> 05:29:34.708 align:start position:0%
in the opinion of the legislature this
person

05:29:34.708 --> 05:29:34.718 align:start position:0%
person
 
05:29:38.310 --> 05:29:38.320 align:start position:0%
was unjustly convicted without trying to
 
05:29:40.390 --> 05:29:40.400 align:start position:0%
specifically tamper with historical
 
05:29:42.868 --> 05:29:42.878 align:start position:0%
records from we have a conviction in
 
05:29:45.430 --> 05:29:45.440 align:start position:0%
massachusetts another jurisdiction and a
 
05:29:47.110 --> 05:29:47.120 align:start position:0%
federal conviction or upheld by the
 
05:29:48.628 --> 05:29:48.638 align:start position:0%
supreme court
 
05:29:50.150 --> 05:29:50.160 align:start position:0%
i'm not even sure if we can do anything
 
05:29:52.070 --> 05:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
with that but we could make a concurrent
 
05:29:54.948 --> 05:29:54.958 align:start position:0%
resolution whereby we expressed that
 
05:29:57.510 --> 05:29:57.520 align:start position:0%
this was a wrongful conviction
 
05:30:00.628 --> 05:30:00.638 align:start position:0%
and we the legislature hereby find that
 
05:30:04.150 --> 05:30:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:05.910 --> 05:30:05.920 align:start position:0%
something to that effect
 
05:30:07.910 --> 05:30:07.920 align:start position:0%
we could certainly do that and that that
 
05:30:09.350 --> 05:30:09.360 align:start position:0%
would accomplish the goal of
 
05:30:11.510 --> 05:30:11.520 align:start position:0%
sending the message right
 
05:30:11.520 --> 05:30:23.430 align:start position:0%
sending the message right
and

05:30:23.430 --> 05:30:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:25.670 --> 05:30:25.680 align:start position:0%
is there any appetite to do anything of
 
05:30:29.270 --> 05:30:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:29.280 --> 05:30:30.070 align:start position:0%
 
so

05:30:30.070 --> 05:30:30.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:30:31.750 --> 05:30:31.760 align:start position:0%
we have a
 
05:30:34.230 --> 05:30:34.240 align:start position:0%
there is a motion
 
05:30:35.830 --> 05:30:35.840 align:start position:0%
that's been made if it's withdrawn i i
 
05:30:37.190 --> 05:30:37.200 align:start position:0%

05:30:39.190 --> 05:30:39.200 align:start position:0%

05:31:06.948 --> 05:31:06.958 align:start position:0%

05:31:06.958 --> 05:31:08.470 align:start position:0%
the motion would need to be withdrawn
first
