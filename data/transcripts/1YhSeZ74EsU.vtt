current bium the system of care for

healthy aging was included in hb2 and
 
00:10:56.910 --> 00:10:56.920 align:start position:0%
this provided the department a
 
00:11:00.829 --> 00:11:00.839 align:start position:0%
significant opportunity um to strengthen
 
00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:04.880 align:start position:0%
our system of care for adults um who are
 
00:11:06.629 --> 00:11:06.639 align:start position:0%

00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:35.269 --> 00:11:35.279 align:start position:0%

um with you today um just really quickly
 
00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:44.600 align:start position:0%
is a very highlevel overview snapshot of
 
00:11:46.829 --> 00:11:46.839 align:start position:0%
information that we've provided as part
 
00:11:49.949 --> 00:11:49.959 align:start position:0%
of the annual report just to talk about
 
00:11:53.269 --> 00:11:53.279 align:start position:0%
the progress that we've made um over the
 
00:11:56.269 --> 00:11:56.279 align:start position:0%
last year and a half for system of care
 
00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
for healthy aging and um first we wanted
 
00:12:05.509 --> 00:12:05.519 align:start position:0%
to just point to the visual uh diagram
 
00:12:07.949 --> 00:12:07.959 align:start position:0%
um this is part of our annual report but
 
00:12:09.629 --> 00:12:09.639 align:start position:0%
it's also something that we worked
 
00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:11.440 align:start position:0%
collaboratively on with the Commission
 
00:12:14.829 --> 00:12:14.839 align:start position:0%
on Aging to really develop a visual um
 
00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:19.800 align:start position:0%
to describe how we are also part of the
 
00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:24.360 align:start position:0%
DHHS uh road map as well as the elements
 
00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:28.040 align:start position:0%
and vision for system of care we talk a
 
00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
about that a little bit more in a little
 
00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:32.880 align:start position:0%
bit more detail in the annual report but
 
00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:35.440 align:start position:0%
the focus that I wanted to try to get to
 
00:12:37.629 --> 00:12:37.639 align:start position:0%
today is around what we've completed in
 
00:12:40.430 --> 00:12:40.440 align:start position:0%
that progress and what we're doing next
 
00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:44.760 align:start position:0%
um we uh completed um over the last year
 
00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:48.320 align:start position:0%
and a half um implementation of the rate
 
00:12:51.189 --> 00:12:51.199 align:start position:0%
increases that were part of hb2 for our
 
00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
choices for Independence waiver program
 
00:12:57.150 --> 00:12:57.160 align:start position:0%
we also implemented and began to
 
00:12:59.829 --> 00:12:59.839 align:start position:0%
operationalize last January
 
00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:02.240 align:start position:0%
um the eligibility changes that were
 
00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:06.760 align:start position:0%
part of the bill we've reoccured our
 
00:13:08.629 --> 00:13:08.639 align:start position:0%
aging and disability Resource Center
 
00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
contracts and included um several
 
00:13:13.509 --> 00:13:13.519 align:start position:0%
elements within the system of care into
 
00:13:13.519 --> 00:13:14.910 align:start position:0%
elements within the system of care into
their

00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:14.920 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:13:17.550 --> 00:13:17.560 align:start position:0%

service link um so we're um
 
00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:26.600 align:start position:0%
transitioning uh how we identify with
 
00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
the work that we're doing at the Aging
 
00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:30.720 align:start position:0%
indust disability Resource Centers and
 
00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:34.000 align:start position:0%

00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:38.000 align:start position:0%

there and we also uh filed our

status of that is that we are currently
 
00:15:11.269 --> 00:15:11.279 align:start position:0%
waiting for the centers for Medicare and
 
00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:15.240 align:start position:0%

start doing
 
00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:22.160 align:start position:0%

federal
 
00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:01.680 align:start position:0%
dollars that can contribute to the work
 
00:16:04.509 --> 00:16:04.519 align:start position:0%
that is being done um we will complete
 
00:16:07.309 --> 00:16:07.319 align:start position:0%

00:16:14.949 --> 00:16:14.959 align:start position:0%
of what those enhancements are and what
 
00:16:17.710 --> 00:16:17.720 align:start position:0%
to be expected um we will also be
 
00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:19.440 align:start position:0%

00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:24.800 align:start position:0%
process after the New Year um to do that
 
00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:26.720 align:start position:0%
and as part of our
 
00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:30.800 align:start position:0%
2627 budget request as part of DHHS we
 
00:16:34.590 --> 00:16:34.600 align:start position:0%
are monitoring and providing education
 
00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:36.880 align:start position:0%
um on the agency and prioritize needs
 
00:16:39.189 --> 00:16:39.199 align:start position:0%
that the bureau
 
00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:48.990 --> 00:16:49.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:51.389 --> 00:16:51.399 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:54.160 align:start position:0%
for taking my question and welcome back
 
00:16:56.509 --> 00:16:56.519 align:start position:0%
um I just had an overall question about
 
00:16:59.590 --> 00:16:59.600 align:start position:0%
the CMS waiver process because if you
 
00:17:02.389 --> 00:17:02.399 align:start position:0%
submit it in the spring and are still
 
00:17:05.549 --> 00:17:05.559 align:start position:0%
waiting for an initial response that
 
00:17:08.990 --> 00:17:09.000 align:start position:0%
seems a little dilatory on their parts
 
00:17:12.029 --> 00:17:12.039 align:start position:0%
is that is that H how long it normally
 
00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:13.520 align:start position:0%
takes for a waiver because I thought
 
00:17:15.390 --> 00:17:15.400 align:start position:0%
that they went most of them went through
 
00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:18.280 align:start position:0%
quicker than that and
 
00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:21.480 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering I wasn't sure if
 
00:17:23.069 --> 00:17:23.079 align:start position:0%
Henry might Henry might have some more
 
00:17:25.309 --> 00:17:25.319 align:start position:0%
detail on that but I think it I think it
 
00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:27.520 align:start position:0%
depends on what the request is and and
 
00:17:30.789 --> 00:17:30.799 align:start position:0%
the um staff within CMS who are
 
00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:32.760 align:start position:0%
reviewing it and what they have in Q
 
00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:36.520 align:start position:0%
also to review Henry Lipman we've got
 
00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:40.789 align:start position:0%
also to review Henry Lipman we've got
mics

00:17:40.789 --> 00:17:40.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:45.720 align:start position:0%
on yeah this is an Engineers WIS you're
 
00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:48.880 align:start position:0%
welcome you're welcome to any of those
 
00:17:51.669 --> 00:17:51.679 align:start position:0%
um so I guess the answer is that we have
 
00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:54.280 align:start position:0%
a commitment that we're going to um you
 
00:17:57.070 --> 00:17:57.080 align:start position:0%
know we've submitted it um there's an
 
00:18:00.310 --> 00:18:00.320 align:start position:0%
extraordinary number of of 11:15 waivers
 
00:18:02.350 --> 00:18:02.360 align:start position:0%
being done I'm going to be talking about
 
00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:05.440 align:start position:0%
what what we got in place we had uh to
 
00:18:08.350 --> 00:18:08.360 align:start position:0%
prioritize what could get approved um
 
00:18:12.669 --> 00:18:12.679 align:start position:0%
back in uh July and um this one was one
 
00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:14.280 align:start position:0%
that they needed more time to work
 
00:18:15.789 --> 00:18:15.799 align:start position:0%
through because it's not one they
 
00:18:17.669 --> 00:18:17.679 align:start position:0%
usually give where versus the others
 
00:18:19.669 --> 00:18:19.679 align:start position:0%
were ones that we already had to be
 
00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:23.120 align:start position:0%
renewed and were um if you will higher
 
00:18:25.549 --> 00:18:25.559 align:start position:0%
priorities for the administration to to
 
00:18:28.510 --> 00:18:28.520 align:start position:0%
get in place um but um I just met with
 
00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:29.430 align:start position:0%
get in place um but um I just met with
the

00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:29.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:18:31.669 --> 00:18:31.679 align:start position:0%
last week with the head of the the
 
00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
waiver group to make sure that we're
 
00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:36.600 align:start position:0%
still um expecting it back in July they
 
00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:39.760 align:start position:0%
told us it would probably be within uh
 
00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:42.640 align:start position:0%
calendar year 25 that we would see it um
 
00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
and that's I think I think we'll get it
 
00:18:48.789 --> 00:18:48.799 align:start position:0%
um and it's just they're they're just
 
00:18:50.470 --> 00:18:50.480 align:start position:0%
overrun at this moment in terms of all
 
00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:51.720 align:start position:0%
the things they're trying to do plus
 
00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:52.880 align:start position:0%
with the change in
 
00:18:55.909 --> 00:18:55.919 align:start position:0%
administrations y would you accept a
 
00:18:59.510 --> 00:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
recess appointment equivalent
 
00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:03.520 align:start position:0%
be happy to do it only if I just make M
 
00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:05.080 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I just wanted to make it
 
00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:06.760 align:start position:0%
very clear that I was not implying that
 
00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:09.000 align:start position:0%
anybody in our department was at all
 
00:19:11.909 --> 00:19:11.919 align:start position:0%
dilatory I just just seemed to me like
 
00:19:13.669 --> 00:19:13.679 align:start position:0%
seemed an extraordinary amount of time
 
00:19:15.789 --> 00:19:15.799 align:start position:0%
for the federal government to respond so
 
00:19:17.549 --> 00:19:17.559 align:start position:0%
thank you for the explanation I get it
 
00:19:19.149 --> 00:19:19.159 align:start position:0%
you're most welcome I think we've been
 
00:19:20.710 --> 00:19:20.720 align:start position:0%
treated pretty well as a state in terms
 
00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:22.880 align:start position:0%
of getting things done like with the
 
00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
dental U waivers that we needed and um
 
00:19:28.149 --> 00:19:28.159 align:start position:0%
they've they've tried to work with us
 
00:19:29.630 --> 00:19:29.640 align:start position:0%
and some they have to pay attention to
 
00:19:35.710 --> 00:19:35.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:40.240 align:start position:0%
you I think yes representative
 
00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:43.080 align:start position:0%
Edwards thank you for that and uh
 
00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:45.480 align:start position:0%
putting on uh the division three hat for
 
00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:49.440 align:start position:0%
a little while I I I I love the kind of
 
00:19:51.909 --> 00:19:51.919 align:start position:0%
the conceptual visual information aspect
 
00:19:55.630 --> 00:19:55.640 align:start position:0%
of this but it would be nice um uh and I
 
00:19:57.710 --> 00:19:57.720 align:start position:0%
know that you have tons of spreadsheets
 
00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:00.640 align:start position:0%
that Mr White's to show us but it would
 
00:20:03.909 --> 00:20:03.919 align:start position:0%
it would be useful in January or
 
00:20:05.630 --> 00:20:05.640 align:start position:0%
February whenever I guess it's going to
 
00:20:08.190 --> 00:20:08.200 align:start position:0%
be February when we get together to see
 
00:20:11.390 --> 00:20:11.400 align:start position:0%
something like this to and to show us
 
00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:13.840 align:start position:0%
what kind of general fund impact that
 
00:20:17.390 --> 00:20:17.400 align:start position:0%
these slides have and uh you know on
 
00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:20.240 align:start position:0%
this this circle of life you know where
 
00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:22.720 align:start position:0%
we're kind of spending money just to
 
00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:24.760 align:start position:0%
just to take this nice conceptual
 
00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:27.360 align:start position:0%
outline and give it some life in terms
 
00:20:29.549 --> 00:20:29.559 align:start position:0%
of what kind of res resources are being
 
00:20:32.350 --> 00:20:32.360 align:start position:0%
consumed in this this is this this could
 
00:20:35.549 --> 00:20:35.559 align:start position:0%
be just a little bit of of resource or
 
00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:38.720 align:start position:0%
could be a ton of resource and that that
 
00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:40.200 align:start position:0%
that's really going to be important
 
00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:42.760 align:start position:0%
going into this next budget cycle
 
00:20:44.789 --> 00:20:44.799 align:start position:0%
definitely yeah and so I'm not asking
 
00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:47.840 align:start position:0%
for feedback now I'm just telling you I
 
00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:50.520 align:start position:0%
I think this let's see this again in the
 
00:20:53.110 --> 00:20:53.120 align:start position:0%
future but but associate some resources
 
00:20:54.830 --> 00:20:54.840 align:start position:0%
with it
 
00:20:57.190 --> 00:20:57.200 align:start position:0%
please representative Merchant don't
 
00:20:58.870 --> 00:20:58.880 align:start position:0%
throw away your lawn signs with we want
 
00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
you back in two years thank you Mr chair
 
00:21:04.190 --> 00:21:04.200 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for this presentation as
 
00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:06.360 align:start position:0%
well one of the things that we're
 
00:21:08.430 --> 00:21:08.440 align:start position:0%
experiencing here in the state is an
 
00:21:12.350 --> 00:21:12.360 align:start position:0%
aging population and also when I talk to
 
00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
people there's more desire to stay at
 
00:21:17.870 --> 00:21:17.880 align:start position:0%
home AG in place which is non
 
00:21:21.190 --> 00:21:21.200 align:start position:0%
institutional care so trying to tie this
 
00:21:22.549 --> 00:21:22.559 align:start position:0%
all together goes back to repr of
 
00:21:25.310 --> 00:21:25.320 align:start position:0%
Edwards is looking for resources because
 
00:21:27.230 --> 00:21:27.240 align:start position:0%
ultimately if we have an aging
 
00:21:29.470 --> 00:21:29.480 align:start position:0%
population when you build the budget is
 
00:21:31.230 --> 00:21:31.240 align:start position:0%
we have enough resources into the
 
00:21:33.510 --> 00:21:33.520 align:start position:0%
homebased care that we put in
 
00:21:35.070 --> 00:21:35.080 align:start position:0%
institutional care because if that's
 
00:21:37.149 --> 00:21:37.159 align:start position:0%
where people want to stay I'd like to
 
00:21:39.310 --> 00:21:39.320 align:start position:0%
encourage us to do
 
00:21:42.830 --> 00:21:42.840 align:start position:0%
that it's also less expensive it is
 
00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:45.440 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards I do have a a
 
00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
supplemental thought um I I think for
 
00:21:50.190 --> 00:21:50.200 align:start position:0%
the second year I'm going to be wanting
 
00:21:52.789 --> 00:21:52.799 align:start position:0%
to take a look at if there are
 
00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:54.760 align:start position:0%
additional services that we want to
 
00:21:57.750 --> 00:21:57.760 align:start position:0%
migrate into a Managed Care structure
 
00:21:59.830 --> 00:21:59.840 align:start position:0%
and so I think one of the conversations
 
00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:03.240 align:start position:0%
we could have in February would be this
 
00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:05.840 align:start position:0%
is sort of a a roll your own State doing
 
00:22:08.789 --> 00:22:08.799 align:start position:0%
this for ourselves kind of thing what
 
00:22:10.430 --> 00:22:10.440 align:start position:0%
what would it look like if we were to
 
00:22:12.950 --> 00:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
try to put this into a Managed Care
 
00:22:15.630 --> 00:22:15.640 align:start position:0%
structure so and and again the resource
 
00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:20.400 align:start position:0%
implications of that um thank you thank
 
00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
you any further
 
00:22:30.029 --> 00:22:30.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:32.669 --> 00:22:32.679 align:start position:0%
great all right so as promised up next
 
00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
we'll have associate commissioner Ann
 
00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:36.480 align:start position:0%
Landry and Medicaid director Henry lman
 
00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:38.640 align:start position:0%
on community re-entry as well as the U
 
00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:52.789 --> 00:22:52.799 align:start position:0%
work good morning anry associate
 
00:22:55.029 --> 00:22:55.039 align:start position:0%

00:22:55.039 --> 00:22:56.350 align:start position:0%
commissioner Henry Litman for the record
Medicaid

00:22:56.350 --> 00:22:56.360 align:start position:0%
Medicaid
 
00:22:58.950 --> 00:22:58.960 align:start position:0%
director and we just wanted take a few
 
00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:01.440 align:start position:0%
minutes this morning to share some
 
00:23:05.870 --> 00:23:05.880 align:start position:0%
exciting news um as along lines that the
 
00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:07.840 align:start position:0%
Medicaid team along with Behavioral
 
00:23:09.029 --> 00:23:09.039 align:start position:0%
Health Team and Department of
 
00:23:11.149 --> 00:23:11.159 align:start position:0%
Corrections excuse me can I ask you to
 
00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:14.240 align:start position:0%
speak louder for these elderly ears sure
 
00:23:16.990 --> 00:23:17.000 align:start position:0%
sorry I do my voice does stop I'll be
 
00:23:20.350 --> 00:23:20.360 align:start position:0%
better voice um so for the past couple
 
00:23:22.269 --> 00:23:22.279 align:start position:0%
of years we've had a dedicated team
 
00:23:24.630 --> 00:23:24.640 align:start position:0%
working on an exciting program that is
 
00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
focused on the re-entry into the
 
00:23:30.149 --> 00:23:30.159 align:start position:0%
community from the for the incarcerated
 
00:23:32.669 --> 00:23:32.679 align:start position:0%
population for the adults and since July
 
00:23:34.190 --> 00:23:34.200 align:start position:0%
due to a mandate from the federal
 
00:23:36.149 --> 00:23:36.159 align:start position:0%
government we've also been working on a
 
00:23:39.789 --> 00:23:39.799 align:start position:0%
program to um focus on reintegrating
 
00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:42.640 align:start position:0%
youth back into the community um for
 
00:23:45.909 --> 00:23:45.919 align:start position:0%
those who are eligible 18 to 21 and then
 
00:23:48.909 --> 00:23:48.919 align:start position:0%
21 to 26 from for former foster care and
 
00:23:51.750 --> 00:23:51.760 align:start position:0%
so this has really been an incredible
 
00:23:53.870 --> 00:23:53.880 align:start position:0%
joint effort between the Department of
 
00:23:56.110 --> 00:23:56.120 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services and the
 
00:23:58.510 --> 00:23:58.520 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections and within the
 
00:23:59.830 --> 00:23:59.840 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:02.400 align:start position:0%
it's been a close collaboration with the
 
00:24:04.230 --> 00:24:04.240 align:start position:0%
division of Medicaid services division
 
00:24:06.390 --> 00:24:06.400 align:start position:0%
of Behavioral Health Services Division
 
00:24:08.510 --> 00:24:08.520 align:start position:0%
of children youth and families along
 
00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
with our eligibility team um in division
 
00:24:14.590 --> 00:24:14.600 align:start position:0%
of economic supports so it really
 
00:24:16.950 --> 00:24:16.960 align:start position:0%
highlights the the important work that
 
00:24:19.029 --> 00:24:19.039 align:start position:0%
we're doing together to ensure that
 
00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
these individuals receive Medicaid
 
00:24:24.350 --> 00:24:24.360 align:start position:0%
benefits um pre-release and then back
 
00:24:25.669 --> 00:24:25.679 align:start position:0%
into the community and with that I'll
 
00:24:29.389 --> 00:24:29.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:32.549 --> 00:24:32.559 align:start position:0%
make sure you can hear me well y okay
 
00:24:36.029 --> 00:24:36.039 align:start position:0%
good um so I think probably uh those who
 
00:24:39.909 --> 00:24:39.919 align:start position:0%
serve on in the house and oversee County
 
00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:41.840 align:start position:0%
are familiar with sort of the inmate
 
00:24:44.350 --> 00:24:44.360 align:start position:0%
exclusion where um Counties have to pick
 
00:24:47.549 --> 00:24:47.559 align:start position:0%
up medical cost because with only
 
00:24:49.430 --> 00:24:49.440 align:start position:0%
certain exceptions they only cover
 
00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:52.960 align:start position:0%
inpatient care this is actually um a
 
00:24:56.669 --> 00:24:56.679 align:start position:0%
chance for um both state corrections and
 
00:25:00.430 --> 00:25:00.440 align:start position:0%
for the um County corre uh jails to be
 
00:25:03.190 --> 00:25:03.200 align:start position:0%
able to tap into um some additional
 
00:25:05.870 --> 00:25:05.880 align:start position:0%
Federal funding to support um the
 
00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:09.360 align:start position:0%
successful transition um from
 
00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
incarceration to um the community you
 
00:25:15.269 --> 00:25:15.279 align:start position:0%
know the state uh and Counties have done
 
00:25:17.710 --> 00:25:17.720 align:start position:0%
work with the council state governments
 
00:25:19.269 --> 00:25:19.279 align:start position:0%
that you know one of the major reasons
 
00:25:22.590 --> 00:25:22.600 align:start position:0%
people have recidivism is is difficulty
 
00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:24.360 align:start position:0%
maintaining sobriety over with mental
 
00:25:27.190 --> 00:25:27.200 align:start position:0%
health issues um so uh commissioner
 
00:25:29.230 --> 00:25:29.240 align:start position:0%
Hanks approached us
 
00:25:31.230 --> 00:25:31.240 align:start position:0%
uh before there actually were criteria
 
00:25:34.389 --> 00:25:34.399 align:start position:0%
to apply for this Grant and asked us uh
 
00:25:36.669 --> 00:25:36.679 align:start position:0%
if we would make a waiver request a
 
00:25:39.430 --> 00:25:39.440 align:start position:0%
special request at the time um to obtain
 
00:25:44.950 --> 00:25:44.960 align:start position:0%
an 1115 waiver um and basically um we
 
00:25:48.870 --> 00:25:48.880 align:start position:0%
did apply in 2022 in 2023 the federal
 
00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:50.960 align:start position:0%
government came out with um actually
 
00:25:52.830 --> 00:25:52.840 align:start position:0%
criteria to apply we had to adjust what
 
00:25:55.789 --> 00:25:55.799 align:start position:0%
we had submitted um in July we receiv
 
00:25:58.070 --> 00:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
received that so the the net effect of
 
00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:00.960 align:start position:0%
it is that for adults
 
00:26:05.590 --> 00:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
um um that during the 45 days prior to
 
00:26:08.190 --> 00:26:08.200 align:start position:0%
release um Medicaid can come in and
 
00:26:12.630 --> 00:26:12.640 align:start position:0%
provide support for um mental health and
 
00:26:15.909 --> 00:26:15.919 align:start position:0%
sud um by starting to get the
 
00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:18.480 align:start position:0%
relationship and actually have U Managed
 
00:26:21.110 --> 00:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
Care visits if you will like with from
 
00:26:24.190 --> 00:26:24.200 align:start position:0%
the Mental Health Center or others uh to
 
00:26:27.430 --> 00:26:27.440 align:start position:0%
address those issues so that um upon
 
00:26:29.149 --> 00:26:29.159 align:start position:0%
release they've already have those
 
00:26:31.710 --> 00:26:31.720 align:start position:0%
relationships established we can support
 
00:26:33.789 --> 00:26:33.799 align:start position:0%
some of the cost of the those
 
00:26:37.070 --> 00:26:37.080 align:start position:0%
medications um during that 45-day period
 
00:26:38.430 --> 00:26:38.440 align:start position:0%
but probably probably one of the biggest
 
00:26:40.750 --> 00:26:40.760 align:start position:0%
savings and biggest success factors I
 
00:26:44.350 --> 00:26:44.360 align:start position:0%
think is that upon discharge that uh the
 
00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:46.240 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Program can the federal
 
00:26:47.590 --> 00:26:47.600 align:start position:0%
government will kick in to pay for a
 
00:26:50.510 --> 00:26:50.520 align:start position:0%
30-day supply of medications so that you
 
00:26:53.909 --> 00:26:53.919 align:start position:0%
know when they um they leave they don't
 
00:26:56.549 --> 00:26:56.559 align:start position:0%
end up in emergency rooms or you know
 
00:26:59.549 --> 00:26:59.559 align:start position:0%
seeking relief that they need to support
 
00:27:02.549 --> 00:27:02.559 align:start position:0%
either um a mental health or or sud
 
00:27:02.559 --> 00:27:04.070 align:start position:0%
either um a mental health or or sud
condition

00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
condition
 
00:27:08.029 --> 00:27:08.039 align:start position:0%
um so that's sort of the adult program
 
00:27:10.110 --> 00:27:10.120 align:start position:0%
um the idea also is to make sure that if
 
00:27:13.590 --> 00:27:13.600 align:start position:0%
they're eligible for Medicaid um to get
 
00:27:17.830 --> 00:27:17.840 align:start position:0%
that set up so again medical reasons
 
00:27:20.029 --> 00:27:20.039 align:start position:0%
mental health reasons pharmaceutical
 
00:27:23.430 --> 00:27:23.440 align:start position:0%
reasons aren't the reason for reiis and
 
00:27:25.029 --> 00:27:25.039 align:start position:0%
as I mentioned earlier the council state
 
00:27:26.389 --> 00:27:26.399 align:start position:0%
governments who studied a lot of New
 
00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:28.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's experience and you know Hank
 
00:27:32.750 --> 00:27:32.760 align:start position:0%
own um experiences a lot of those reism
 
00:27:34.669 --> 00:27:34.679 align:start position:0%
are related to you know health
 
00:27:38.470 --> 00:27:38.480 align:start position:0%
conditions so that that uh we were among
 
00:27:39.950 --> 00:27:39.960 align:start position:0%
uh the first states in the country to
 
00:27:42.269 --> 00:27:42.279 align:start position:0%
receive that waiver um we'll probably be
 
00:27:44.630 --> 00:27:44.640 align:start position:0%
second in the country to be implementing
 
00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:48.080 align:start position:0%
our we're um looking to implement um
 
00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
in January starting January with the
 
00:27:53.590 --> 00:27:53.600 align:start position:0%
state facilities um because we've been
 
00:27:55.909 --> 00:27:55.919 align:start position:0%
working for a long time as uh associate
 
00:27:58.710 --> 00:27:58.720 align:start position:0%
commissioner Landry mentioned um and you
 
00:28:01.470 --> 00:28:01.480 align:start position:0%
know I think we're fortunate to have um
 
00:28:03.789 --> 00:28:03.799 align:start position:0%
and commissioner Hank someone who is you
 
00:28:06.269 --> 00:28:06.279 align:start position:0%
know actively engaged in wanting to do
 
00:28:09.389 --> 00:28:09.399 align:start position:0%
this and and um so that's helpful so as
 
00:28:11.269 --> 00:28:11.279 align:start position:0%
uh commissioner Landry mentioned before
 
00:28:13.710 --> 00:28:13.720 align:start position:0%
you move on can can I make a qu ask a
 
00:28:16.190 --> 00:28:16.200 align:start position:0%
question about what you said so far so
 
00:28:18.149 --> 00:28:18.159 align:start position:0%
the idea is when somebody is released
 
00:28:22.590 --> 00:28:22.600 align:start position:0%
there's 30 days of medications
 
00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:26.310 align:start position:0%
there's 30 days of medications
supplied

00:28:26.310 --> 00:28:26.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:30.070 --> 00:28:30.080 align:start position:0%
um sorry uh 30 days of medication
 
00:28:32.509 --> 00:28:32.519 align:start position:0%
supplied and many presumably will not
 
00:28:34.990 --> 00:28:35.000 align:start position:0%
have a job to go to or so they would
 
00:28:38.310 --> 00:28:38.320 align:start position:0%
qualify for at least Medicare perhaps uh
 
00:28:40.870 --> 00:28:40.880 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Medicaid okay some will qualify
 
00:28:42.430 --> 00:28:42.440 align:start position:0%
for Medicare if they're older being
 
00:28:45.909 --> 00:28:45.919 align:start position:0%
released got it and that would mean that
 
00:28:48.630 --> 00:28:48.640 align:start position:0%
um you got a 30-day window to get them
 
00:28:51.149 --> 00:28:51.159 align:start position:0%
into this
 
00:28:53.590 --> 00:28:53.600 align:start position:0%
otherwise don't they can't afford their
 
00:28:56.070 --> 00:28:56.080 align:start position:0%
medications and right I mean I think you
 
00:28:58.149 --> 00:28:58.159 align:start position:0%
know if anybody just try to make a
 
00:29:00.590 --> 00:29:00.600 align:start position:0%
doctor's appointment today you know or
 
00:29:02.710 --> 00:29:02.720 align:start position:0%
establishes a new patient it's difficult
 
00:29:04.470 --> 00:29:04.480 align:start position:0%
and so what we don't want people to do
 
00:29:07.190 --> 00:29:07.200 align:start position:0%
is fail on all the good work that's been
 
00:29:09.590 --> 00:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
invested you know New Hampshire fulfills
 
00:29:11.190 --> 00:29:11.200 align:start position:0%
its constitutional responsibility for
 
00:29:14.149 --> 00:29:14.159 align:start position:0%
treatment within um you know the system
 
00:29:16.070 --> 00:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
and so you know you don't want it all
 
00:29:18.710 --> 00:29:18.720 align:start position:0%
that good work and time and effort to to
 
00:29:20.830 --> 00:29:20.840 align:start position:0%
then result in a bounceback because they
 
00:29:23.830 --> 00:29:23.840 align:start position:0%
haven't got the medicines and care that
 
00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:25.840 align:start position:0%
they need
 
00:29:28.190 --> 00:29:28.200 align:start position:0%
represent thank you and as a followup to
 
00:29:31.430 --> 00:29:31.440 align:start position:0%
that question uh was I hearing that
 
00:29:34.389 --> 00:29:34.399 align:start position:0%
during the 45 days when they're still
 
00:29:36.990 --> 00:29:37.000 align:start position:0%
incarcerated there's also an effort to
 
00:29:41.230 --> 00:29:41.240 align:start position:0%
make some Community connections so that
 
00:29:44.110 --> 00:29:44.120 align:start position:0%
upon release which is a big shock they
 
00:29:47.990 --> 00:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
might actually have already formed a
 
00:29:51.350 --> 00:29:51.360 align:start position:0%
connection as to where to go to
 
00:29:54.149 --> 00:29:54.159 align:start position:0%
continue with whatever kind of services
 
00:29:56.230 --> 00:29:56.240 align:start position:0%
they're needing is that you have it
 
00:29:59.909 --> 00:29:59.919 align:start position:0%
correct so the intake is terrific Y and
 
00:30:01.789 --> 00:30:01.799 align:start position:0%
hopefully U also there's a Care
 
00:30:03.470 --> 00:30:03.480 align:start position:0%
Management component which will be
 
00:30:06.789 --> 00:30:06.799 align:start position:0%
provided um by the mcos to make sure
 
00:30:08.110 --> 00:30:08.120 align:start position:0%
like if they need appointments that
 
00:30:09.990 --> 00:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
those are established before they hit
 
00:30:12.669 --> 00:30:12.679 align:start position:0%
the street if you will um and you know
 
00:30:14.630 --> 00:30:14.640 align:start position:0%
we'll be coordinating with the care
 
00:30:17.430 --> 00:30:17.440 align:start position:0%
coordination that happens within um the
 
00:30:21.310 --> 00:30:21.320 align:start position:0%
correction system thank you very
 
00:30:23.950 --> 00:30:23.960 align:start position:0%
much representative Edwards uh thank you
 
00:30:27.990 --> 00:30:28.000 align:start position:0%
Mr chair um so again I'm I'm just got my
 
00:30:30.509 --> 00:30:30.519 align:start position:0%
Financial hat on uh the the the adult
 
00:30:32.549 --> 00:30:32.559 align:start position:0%
community re-entry demonstration looks
 
00:30:35.350 --> 00:30:35.360 align:start position:0%
like it was our idea and it's a good one
 
00:30:38.230 --> 00:30:38.240 align:start position:0%
and but it's got a a cost implication
 
00:30:40.669 --> 00:30:40.679 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm I'm wondering if it's a a net
 
00:30:43.310 --> 00:30:43.320 align:start position:0%
reduction on state costs or if you think
 
00:30:46.310 --> 00:30:46.320 align:start position:0%
it's a net increase in state costs I
 
00:30:49.669 --> 00:30:49.679 align:start position:0%
believe it will be a net reduction that
 
00:30:51.549 --> 00:30:51.559 align:start position:0%
reduction like with dental when we
 
00:30:53.430 --> 00:30:53.440 align:start position:0%
talked about that doesn't not going to
 
00:30:55.710 --> 00:30:55.720 align:start position:0%
happen immediately okay just interested
 
00:30:57.389 --> 00:30:57.399 align:start position:0%
time that's really all I needed to hear
 
00:30:59.669 --> 00:30:59.679 align:start position:0%
and then if I may on the second one you
 
00:31:02.269 --> 00:31:02.279 align:start position:0%
may the same kind of question on the
 
00:31:04.269 --> 00:31:04.279 align:start position:0%
this the community re-entry
 
00:31:07.070 --> 00:31:07.080 align:start position:0%
demonstration uh this this looks like an
 
00:31:09.389 --> 00:31:09.399 align:start position:0%
unfunded mandate that is going to cost
 
00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
us more money and I'm not talking about
 
00:31:14.310 --> 00:31:14.320 align:start position:0%
the quality and value of the program I'm
 
00:31:17.990 --> 00:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
just looking at uh increased demands on
 
00:31:20.430 --> 00:31:20.440 align:start position:0%
on General funds what this this feels
 
00:31:22.470 --> 00:31:22.480 align:start position:0%
like an increase in demand on General
 
00:31:25.190 --> 00:31:25.200 align:start position:0%
funds if so can you give me an idea
 
00:31:27.590 --> 00:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
rough order of magnitude with the price
 
00:31:31.070 --> 00:31:31.080 align:start position:0%
tag guess so we're talking about youth
 
00:31:33.310 --> 00:31:33.320 align:start position:0%
re-entry now the the congressionally
 
00:31:37.830 --> 00:31:37.840 align:start position:0%
mandated piece yeah so it may relieve
 
00:31:40.789 --> 00:31:40.799 align:start position:0%
some costs at accting level um it may
 
00:31:45.350 --> 00:31:45.360 align:start position:0%
relieve some costs in in Corrections um
 
00:31:48.669 --> 00:31:48.679 align:start position:0%
and again like most of the when you
 
00:31:51.590 --> 00:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
think about children kids coming on syc
 
00:31:53.669 --> 00:31:53.679 align:start position:0%
you know we have them typically just for
 
00:31:56.789 --> 00:31:56.799 align:start position:0%
time I'm just talking about money okay I
 
00:31:59.430 --> 00:31:59.440 align:start position:0%
would say that net cost again over time
 
00:32:02.029 --> 00:32:02.039 align:start position:0%
will be less um than what we're spending
 
00:32:03.950 --> 00:32:03.960 align:start position:0%
today even though it's an unfunded
 
00:32:06.149 --> 00:32:06.159 align:start position:0%
Federal mandate well the feds are
 
00:32:09.590 --> 00:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
putting money in um as well um you know
 
00:32:13.909 --> 00:32:13.919 align:start position:0%
to uh to cover costs uh I think that
 
00:32:15.430 --> 00:32:15.440 align:start position:0%
since we have them in the program
 
00:32:17.830 --> 00:32:17.840 align:start position:0%
anyways if we have them in a plann
 
00:32:19.190 --> 00:32:19.200 align:start position:0%
fashion and we're doing it on a
 
00:32:21.590 --> 00:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
preventative basis we're going to you
 
00:32:22.909 --> 00:32:22.919 align:start position:0%
know dealing with people in emergency
 
00:32:24.909 --> 00:32:24.919 align:start position:0%
rooms dealing with boarding and dealing
 
00:32:26.710 --> 00:32:26.720 align:start position:0%
with other issues that we deal with I
 
00:32:28.870 --> 00:32:28.880 align:start position:0%
think the cost of the system as the
 
00:32:31.430 --> 00:32:31.440 align:start position:0%
state experience it should be less than
 
00:32:35.310 --> 00:32:35.320 align:start position:0%
what it is uh today and in terms of um
 
00:32:38.950 --> 00:32:38.960 align:start position:0%
the next uh uh Managed Care contract
 
00:32:40.990 --> 00:32:41.000 align:start position:0%
Amendment we do have some costs that we
 
00:32:43.549 --> 00:32:43.559 align:start position:0%
pay out but I think that the the cost
 
00:32:45.629 --> 00:32:45.639 align:start position:0%
that come back that we don't experience
 
00:32:48.310 --> 00:32:48.320 align:start position:0%
in the back end will offset that thank
 
00:32:52.710 --> 00:32:52.720 align:start position:0%
thank you this would be a good PL um ABC
 
00:32:54.750 --> 00:32:54.760 align:start position:0%
this would be a good B or C conversation
 
00:32:57.830 --> 00:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
to have offline sure please continue
 
00:32:57.840 --> 00:32:59.549 align:start position:0%
to have offline sure please continue
continue

00:32:59.549 --> 00:32:59.559 align:start position:0%
continue
 
00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:03.200 align:start position:0%
um so on the on the youth side um the
 
00:33:07.230 --> 00:33:07.240 align:start position:0%
benefits a little bit different um and
 
00:33:10.190 --> 00:33:10.200 align:start position:0%
basically there's uh 30 days prior to
 
00:33:14.509 --> 00:33:14.519 align:start position:0%
release there's basically um the epsdt
 
00:33:17.190 --> 00:33:17.200 align:start position:0%
basically the screening for um
 
00:33:21.350 --> 00:33:21.360 align:start position:0%
conditions um and diagnostic services
 
00:33:24.909 --> 00:33:24.919 align:start position:0%
can be covered um and so like a physical
 
00:33:27.350 --> 00:33:27.360 align:start position:0%
or or mental health assessment all those
 
00:33:30.190 --> 00:33:30.200 align:start position:0%
types of things are are um coverable
 
00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:32.760 align:start position:0%
Services plus after release whether
 
00:33:34.509 --> 00:33:34.519 align:start position:0%
they're on Medicaid or not they get 30
 
00:33:38.310 --> 00:33:38.320 align:start position:0%
days of of Care Management um the the
 
00:33:41.149 --> 00:33:41.159 align:start position:0%
other thing is that you know in Medicaid
 
00:33:43.190 --> 00:33:43.200 align:start position:0%
the definition of child is under 21 and
 
00:33:46.230 --> 00:33:46.240 align:start position:0%
the prison system it can be um you know
 
00:33:48.750 --> 00:33:48.760 align:start position:0%
different they might look at it as 18
 
00:33:50.830 --> 00:33:50.840 align:start position:0%
the other thing is former foster care
 
00:33:55.470 --> 00:33:55.480 align:start position:0%
children um up to um the their end of 26
 
00:33:56.909 --> 00:33:56.919 align:start position:0%
if you will when they turn 26 they lose
 
00:33:59.149 --> 00:33:59.159 align:start position:0%
it but the former foster care which
 
00:34:02.310 --> 00:34:02.320 align:start position:0%
nationally they say about 50% of the
 
00:34:05.149 --> 00:34:05.159 align:start position:0%
children that are in prison have had our
 
00:34:08.109 --> 00:34:08.119 align:start position:0%
former foster care so making sure that
 
00:34:11.190 --> 00:34:11.200 align:start position:0%
um they're getting supports as well um
 
00:34:12.909 --> 00:34:12.919 align:start position:0%
also in our Managed Care Program the
 
00:34:14.669 --> 00:34:14.679 align:start position:0%
general Managed Care Program we get
 
00:34:17.669 --> 00:34:17.679 align:start position:0%
there when we repr procured we have
 
00:34:21.589 --> 00:34:21.599 align:start position:0%
prioritized um uh Managed Care follow up
 
00:34:24.310 --> 00:34:24.320 align:start position:0%
on this this priority population of
 
00:34:26.109 --> 00:34:26.119 align:start position:0%
incarcerated individuals to follow them
 
00:34:28.829 --> 00:34:28.839 align:start position:0%
up for a year to make sure again that
 
00:34:31.430 --> 00:34:31.440 align:start position:0%
we're we're experiencing the cost at the
 
00:34:33.430 --> 00:34:33.440 align:start position:0%
lowest level by doing more things on a
 
00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:36.909 align:start position:0%
lowest level by doing more things on a
preventative

00:34:36.909 --> 00:34:36.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:40.190 --> 00:34:40.200 align:start position:0%
basis representative Merchant thank you
 
00:34:42.510 --> 00:34:42.520 align:start position:0%
Mr chair it's more of a comment than a
 
00:34:45.310 --> 00:34:45.320 align:start position:0%
question um I think when you I'm hearing
 
00:34:47.470 --> 00:34:47.480 align:start position:0%
is that this is more an investment than
 
00:34:50.430 --> 00:34:50.440 align:start position:0%
an expense um if we're investing in
 
00:34:52.669 --> 00:34:52.679 align:start position:0%
trying to help the individual get off on
 
00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:55.200 align:start position:0%
the right foot the long-term payback
 
00:34:57.390 --> 00:34:57.400 align:start position:0%
could be tremendous is that what I'm
 
00:34:59.430 --> 00:34:59.440 align:start position:0%
understanding yes I think both for
 
00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
Corrections and county jails in terms of
 
00:35:04.790 --> 00:35:04.800 align:start position:0%
recidivism and in Medicaid that that
 
00:35:06.349 --> 00:35:06.359 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with the problem at the
 
00:35:10.550 --> 00:35:10.560 align:start position:0%
right level not not in the ER not in
 
00:35:13.230 --> 00:35:13.240 align:start position:0%
institutions right trying to get you I
 
00:35:15.510 --> 00:35:15.520 align:start position:0%
may is in Sullivan County we actually
 
00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
have something called the Sullivan house
 
00:35:19.349 --> 00:35:19.359 align:start position:0%
because what we found out is that when
 
00:35:20.990 --> 00:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
you go through all the Investments
 
00:35:23.109 --> 00:35:23.119 align:start position:0%
whether in carcerated and to get them on
 
00:35:25.069 --> 00:35:25.079 align:start position:0%
the right foot they end up going back
 
00:35:26.550 --> 00:35:26.560 align:start position:0%
into the apartment which they came out
 
00:35:28.349 --> 00:35:28.359 align:start position:0%
of so we actually created the suvan
 
00:35:31.030 --> 00:35:31.040 align:start position:0%
house in order to help them for another
 
00:35:35.030 --> 00:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
6 months so expect maybe again if it's
 
00:35:36.910 --> 00:35:36.920 align:start position:0%
pilot is collecting some data from the
 
00:35:39.550 --> 00:35:39.560 align:start position:0%
suent house to show what it will mean as
 
00:35:41.990 --> 00:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
far as that investment if if I could
 
00:35:43.710 --> 00:35:43.720 align:start position:0%
make one comment I think I can end it
 
00:35:44.710 --> 00:35:44.720 align:start position:0%
this if you don't have any other
 
00:35:46.550 --> 00:35:46.560 align:start position:0%
questions is that uh we're already
 
00:35:48.390 --> 00:35:48.400 align:start position:0%
starting to meet with counties we've met
 
00:35:50.150 --> 00:35:50.160 align:start position:0%
with Sullivan County um we've met with
 
00:35:51.910 --> 00:35:51.920 align:start position:0%
six of the 10 so far and we hope in the
 
00:35:53.870 --> 00:35:53.880 align:start position:0%
next few weeks we'll accomplish the rest
 
00:35:57.030 --> 00:35:57.040 align:start position:0%
to make an assessment one of the things
 
00:35:58.470 --> 00:35:58.480 align:start position:0%
the differenti cheting factors here
 
00:35:59.550 --> 00:35:59.560 align:start position:0%
they'll point out that's in the
 
00:36:02.750 --> 00:36:02.760 align:start position:0%
presentation is that the the federal
 
00:36:05.069 --> 00:36:05.079 align:start position:0%
requirement and the waiver all are on
 
00:36:07.390 --> 00:36:07.400 align:start position:0%
people who are sentenced or adjudicated
 
00:36:09.750 --> 00:36:09.760 align:start position:0%
so if you're not sentenced which in the
 
00:36:12.670 --> 00:36:12.680 align:start position:0%
counties can be up to 75% of the
 
00:36:15.109 --> 00:36:15.119 align:start position:0%
population or more they're not eligible
 
00:36:18.030 --> 00:36:18.040 align:start position:0%
for the benefit um but and so we have to
 
00:36:21.470 --> 00:36:21.480 align:start position:0%
work with the counties to make sure that
 
00:36:24.109 --> 00:36:24.119 align:start position:0%
it the system to provide the medical
 
00:36:26.150 --> 00:36:26.160 align:start position:0%
services fits with what they're already
 
00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:27.950 align:start position:0%
services fits with what they're already
doing

00:36:27.950 --> 00:36:27.960 align:start position:0%
doing
 
00:36:31.950 --> 00:36:31.960 align:start position:0%
may I make a suggestion to you and to
 
00:36:33.190 --> 00:36:33.200 align:start position:0%
anybody else
 
00:36:35.870 --> 00:36:35.880 align:start position:0%
listening there are a certain number of
 
00:36:38.630 --> 00:36:38.640 align:start position:0%
people that I only can convince not on
 
00:36:40.430 --> 00:36:40.440 align:start position:0%
the basis of whether it's right or
 
00:36:43.230 --> 00:36:43.240 align:start position:0%
compassionate but that it is saving
 
00:36:46.870 --> 00:36:46.880 align:start position:0%
money and I can Intuit it that good
 
00:36:49.630 --> 00:36:49.640 align:start position:0%
things often save money they are truly
 
00:36:52.550 --> 00:36:52.560 align:start position:0%
Investments but some people need to see
 
00:36:55.470 --> 00:36:55.480 align:start position:0%
numbers and whether it is something at a
 
00:36:58.710 --> 00:36:58.720 align:start position:0%
beginning stage here or you make use of
 
00:37:01.150 --> 00:37:01.160 align:start position:0%
this being implemented in other states
 
00:37:04.430 --> 00:37:04.440 align:start position:0%
so there is a longitudinal study those
 
00:37:06.150 --> 00:37:06.160 align:start position:0%
numbers help me sell the
 
00:37:08.990 --> 00:37:09.000 align:start position:0%
product we do have a requirement under
 
00:37:10.950 --> 00:37:10.960 align:start position:0%
the 1115 waiver to do a formal
 
00:37:13.589 --> 00:37:13.599 align:start position:0%
independent evaluation of it um so
 
00:37:15.790 --> 00:37:15.800 align:start position:0%
there'll be an interim evaluation and um
 
00:37:18.190 --> 00:37:18.200 align:start position:0%
an evaluation after the five-year waiver
 
00:37:21.589 --> 00:37:21.599 align:start position:0%
length and we intend um to do evaluation
 
00:37:23.230 --> 00:37:23.240 align:start position:0%
on the federally required program as
 
00:37:24.670 --> 00:37:24.680 align:start position:0%
well good looking for bring that
 
00:37:27.950 --> 00:37:27.960 align:start position:0%
information to you thank you any further
 
00:37:30.430 --> 00:37:30.440 align:start position:0%
questions no thank you oh Medicaid
 
00:37:32.349 --> 00:37:32.359 align:start position:0%
schools I think was the other that's
 
00:37:35.030 --> 00:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
right well would you would you like to
 
00:37:37.230 --> 00:37:37.240 align:start position:0%
hear that today or do you want to do
 
00:37:39.550 --> 00:37:39.560 align:start position:0%
that can I have a three and a half
 
00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:40.589 align:start position:0%
that can I have a three and a half
minute

00:37:40.589 --> 00:37:40.599 align:start position:0%
minute
 
00:37:43.589 --> 00:37:43.599 align:start position:0%
version yes maybe even less
 
00:37:47.589 --> 00:37:47.599 align:start position:0%
um so thank you have on the clock um I
 
00:37:49.910 --> 00:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
think um representative Edwards brought
 
00:37:53.510 --> 00:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
up a concern around um parental uh
 
00:37:56.589 --> 00:37:56.599 align:start position:0%
knowledge of what's going on um and I'll
 
00:37:57.829 --> 00:37:57.839 align:start position:0%
differentiate what's going on the
 
00:38:00.589 --> 00:38:00.599 align:start position:0%
Medicaid schools which may happen in
 
00:38:02.510 --> 00:38:02.520 align:start position:0%
schools but not related to the Medicaid
 
00:38:04.470 --> 00:38:04.480 align:start position:0%
schools program the Medicaid schools
 
00:38:08.230 --> 00:38:08.240 align:start position:0%
program the parent has to sign off on um
 
00:38:11.270 --> 00:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
the plan of care um and changes in the
 
00:38:14.750 --> 00:38:14.760 align:start position:0%
plan of care um also in the Medicaid
 
00:38:17.309 --> 00:38:17.319 align:start position:0%
Program the parent is what we call the
 
00:38:19.390 --> 00:38:19.400 align:start position:0%
case head the case head is entitled to
 
00:38:20.829 --> 00:38:20.839 align:start position:0%
get any inform you know we have to
 
00:38:22.950 --> 00:38:22.960 align:start position:0%
provide the full if they ask for all
 
00:38:24.430 --> 00:38:24.440 align:start position:0%
their billing information to see what's
 
00:38:26.710 --> 00:38:26.720 align:start position:0%
going on with their child they they have
 
00:38:31.190 --> 00:38:31.200 align:start position:0%
a right to access that um and so I
 
00:38:32.950 --> 00:38:32.960 align:start position:0%
that's I think we talked a little bit
 
00:38:35.790 --> 00:38:35.800 align:start position:0%
about this at fiscal I don't know if we
 
00:38:37.990 --> 00:38:38.000 align:start position:0%
need more on that or not so I'll leave
 
00:38:40.870 --> 00:38:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:44.309 --> 00:38:44.319 align:start position:0%
you okay so I I I appreciate that I
 
00:38:46.030 --> 00:38:46.040 align:start position:0%
understand that I'm still concern
 
00:38:47.990 --> 00:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
concerned a little bit about this Edge
 
00:38:51.470 --> 00:38:51.480 align:start position:0%
case where kids age out while still in
 
00:38:54.950 --> 00:38:54.960 align:start position:0%
school to where they acrew a privacy
 
00:38:57.109 --> 00:38:57.119 align:start position:0%
right they didn't when they were younger
 
00:39:00.030 --> 00:39:00.040 align:start position:0%
is is there is there a a a group a
 
00:39:02.710 --> 00:39:02.720 align:start position:0%
demographic in the uh Medicaid for
 
00:39:06.950 --> 00:39:06.960 align:start position:0%
school program in which they uh adult
 
00:39:09.150 --> 00:39:09.160 align:start position:0%
medical privacy rights kick in and the
 
00:39:12.190 --> 00:39:12.200 align:start position:0%
parents are no longer um in the loop
 
00:39:14.910 --> 00:39:14.920 align:start position:0%
about what's happening to their care so
 
00:39:17.710 --> 00:39:17.720 align:start position:0%
as I understand the case head has full
 
00:39:22.790 --> 00:39:22.800 align:start position:0%
access to the um to the records that you
 
00:39:24.470 --> 00:39:24.480 align:start position:0%
know the the billing information and
 
00:39:28.030 --> 00:39:28.040 align:start position:0%
what have you so um
 
00:39:32.710 --> 00:39:32.720 align:start position:0%
I I think that um that I think that the
 
00:39:35.069 --> 00:39:35.079 align:start position:0%
the the protections under the Medicaid
 
00:39:37.309 --> 00:39:37.319 align:start position:0%
school program for Parental parent
 
00:39:39.190 --> 00:39:39.200 align:start position:0%
wanting to know what's going on are
 
00:39:41.270 --> 00:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
covered in in several different levels
 
00:39:42.990 --> 00:39:43.000 align:start position:0%
they have to do the approval initially
 
00:39:46.030 --> 00:39:46.040 align:start position:0%
of the plan schools don't want to to
 
00:39:48.470 --> 00:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
because schools have to pay money to
 
00:39:49.710 --> 00:39:49.720 align:start position:0%
have Medicaid to schools they have to
 
00:39:53.270 --> 00:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
pay half the cost or um and so you know
 
00:39:54.710 --> 00:39:54.720 align:start position:0%
they schools are not interested in
 
00:39:56.790 --> 00:39:56.800 align:start position:0%
picking up extra costs through that
 
00:39:59.470 --> 00:39:59.480 align:start position:0%
through that mechanism and then um if
 
00:40:00.950 --> 00:40:00.960 align:start position:0%
there's a change in it there's required
 
00:40:03.030 --> 00:40:03.040 align:start position:0%
sign off and to Bild Medicaid the parent
 
00:40:05.910 --> 00:40:05.920 align:start position:0%
has to sign off on um that's not to say
 
00:40:08.910 --> 00:40:08.920 align:start position:0%
a bad actor if you will might might do
 
00:40:10.150 --> 00:40:10.160 align:start position:0%
something that isn't right but the
 
00:40:12.190 --> 00:40:12.200 align:start position:0%
program I think is structured to to
 
00:40:14.069 --> 00:40:14.079 align:start position:0%
protect parental
 
00:40:16.829 --> 00:40:16.839 align:start position:0%
rights okay let's move on so so my
 
00:40:19.030 --> 00:40:19.040 align:start position:0%
editorial comment on that other than
 
00:40:22.710 --> 00:40:22.720 align:start position:0%
thanking you for following up is is that
 
00:40:25.069 --> 00:40:25.079 align:start position:0%
uh I I think it's critical in this
 
00:40:27.990 --> 00:40:28.000 align:start position:0%
environment that the transparent
 
00:40:30.510 --> 00:40:30.520 align:start position:0%
with the providers and the parents is
 
00:40:33.670 --> 00:40:33.680 align:start position:0%
maintained at a very high level in order
 
00:40:36.270 --> 00:40:36.280 align:start position:0%
for there to be faith and credibility in
 
00:40:37.710 --> 00:40:37.720 align:start position:0%
this program and therefore
 
00:40:40.470 --> 00:40:40.480 align:start position:0%
sustainability and without it becoming a
 
00:40:45.190 --> 00:40:45.200 align:start position:0%
a political distraction so I I I I I am
 
00:40:48.349 --> 00:40:48.359 align:start position:0%
uh glad to hear what your description
 
00:40:51.109 --> 00:40:51.119 align:start position:0%
and I I just hope we continue
 
00:40:53.990 --> 00:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
that one final comment there been in the
 
00:40:56.910 --> 00:40:56.920 align:start position:0%
media this past week about uh local
 
00:40:58.589 --> 00:40:58.599 align:start position:0%
community struggling and the state
 
00:41:01.069 --> 00:41:01.079 align:start position:0%
struggling with special education costs
 
00:41:03.470 --> 00:41:03.480 align:start position:0%
the medical component of that um you
 
00:41:05.349 --> 00:41:05.359 align:start position:0%
know one of our goals and we talk about
 
00:41:06.550 --> 00:41:06.560 align:start position:0%
this at another meeting because I'm want
 
00:41:08.710 --> 00:41:08.720 align:start position:0%
to stay within my three minutes there is
 
00:41:10.829 --> 00:41:10.839 align:start position:0%
help available through Medicaid to
 
00:41:12.710 --> 00:41:12.720 align:start position:0%
communities in dealing with some of
 
00:41:14.790 --> 00:41:14.800 align:start position:0%
their special ed costs and I think we
 
00:41:18.270 --> 00:41:18.280 align:start position:0%
need to work with them to to uh and we
 
00:41:20.109 --> 00:41:20.119 align:start position:0%
we have a plan to do that but I know we
 
00:41:21.630 --> 00:41:21.640 align:start position:0%
don't have time to talk to about good
 
00:41:22.910 --> 00:41:22.920 align:start position:0%
thank you and not counting
 
00:41:25.069 --> 00:41:25.079 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards comments I owe
 
00:41:27.349 --> 00:41:27.359 align:start position:0%
you 22 seconds next time you're here
 
00:41:27.359 --> 00:41:31.589 align:start position:0%
you 22 seconds next time you're here
thank

00:41:31.589 --> 00:41:31.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:34.710 --> 00:41:34.720 align:start position:0%
you um thank you for the great questions
 
00:41:37.430 --> 00:41:37.440 align:start position:0%
and and uh for inviting such an array of
 
00:41:39.150 --> 00:41:39.160 align:start position:0%
of updates if you want I can maybe do
 
00:41:41.230 --> 00:41:41.240 align:start position:0%
the 22nd on the two reports that you
 
00:41:43.829 --> 00:41:43.839 align:start position:0%
asked uh for feedback on but I guess
 
00:41:45.430 --> 00:41:45.440 align:start position:0%
what I would just say at a high level
 
00:41:47.430 --> 00:41:47.440 align:start position:0%
something that struck me listening to my
 
00:41:48.910 --> 00:41:48.920 align:start position:0%
colleagues is that everything you're
 
00:41:50.270 --> 00:41:50.280 align:start position:0%
hearing about today as part of our
 
00:41:52.349 --> 00:41:52.359 align:start position:0%
commissioner's update um or Deputy
 
00:41:54.510 --> 00:41:54.520 align:start position:0%
commissioner's update today is part of
 
00:41:56.349 --> 00:41:56.359 align:start position:0%
our DHHS road map that commissioner we
 
00:41:57.790 --> 00:41:57.800 align:start position:0%
ever presented to you all
 
00:41:59.990 --> 00:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
and it's about serving people in their
 
00:42:02.190 --> 00:42:02.200 align:start position:0%
communities um and not in institutional
 
00:42:05.270 --> 00:42:05.280 align:start position:0%
settings and to that end I want to just
 
00:42:07.190 --> 00:42:07.200 align:start position:0%
emphasize there are two quarterly
 
00:42:09.470 --> 00:42:09.480 align:start position:0%
reports that you have one I believe you
 
00:42:12.190 --> 00:42:12.200 align:start position:0%
have in print here today the other one
 
00:42:13.710 --> 00:42:13.720 align:start position:0%
um John Williams is going to help me
 
00:42:16.270 --> 00:42:16.280 align:start position:0%
distribute via email
 
00:42:18.349 --> 00:42:18.359 align:start position:0%
momentarily um and I just want to give
 
00:42:20.829 --> 00:42:20.839 align:start position:0%
the the 10 seconds on each of them so
 
00:42:24.710 --> 00:42:24.720 align:start position:0%
one is the quarterly report on HB 49 um
 
00:42:27.190 --> 00:42:27.200 align:start position:0%
which is the bill to replace the sen
 
00:42:30.750 --> 00:42:30.760 align:start position:0%
Services Center um and the big news
 
00:42:32.349 --> 00:42:32.359 align:start position:0%
there that is in that report that you
 
00:42:36.309 --> 00:42:36.319 align:start position:0%
have is that we have officially begun um
 
00:42:37.950 --> 00:42:37.960 align:start position:0%

will be located on the campus that is
 
00:42:44.349 --> 00:42:44.359 align:start position:0%
shared with Hamstead hospital um We are
 
00:42:47.150 --> 00:42:47.160 align:start position:0%

00:42:50.309 --> 00:42:50.319 align:start position:0%
community input um stakeholder input and
 
00:42:52.390 --> 00:42:52.400 align:start position:0%
make sure that this is in line with the
 
00:42:54.630 --> 00:42:54.640 align:start position:0%
expectations of HB 49 as well as the
 
00:42:55.790 --> 00:42:55.800 align:start position:0%
important concerns that have come
 
00:42:58.030 --> 00:42:58.040 align:start position:0%
forward from from local neighbors um
 
00:43:00.230 --> 00:43:00.240 align:start position:0%

1573 which was um sponsored by our own
 
00:43:13.670 --> 00:43:13.680 align:start position:0%
chairman representative Pearson and is a
 
00:43:16.109 --> 00:43:16.119 align:start position:0%
bill to allow the department to continue
 
00:43:19.710 --> 00:43:19.720 align:start position:0%
its work to strengthen oversight of
 
00:43:22.589 --> 00:43:22.599 align:start position:0%
Youth residential programs um and to
 
00:43:25.069 --> 00:43:25.079 align:start position:0%
ensure that in those increasingly rare
 
00:43:27.349 --> 00:43:27.359 align:start position:0%
times that we need to utilize programs
 
00:43:29.190 --> 00:43:29.200 align:start position:0%
especially those that are further from
 
00:43:31.750 --> 00:43:31.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um that we are doing so
 
00:43:33.670 --> 00:43:33.680 align:start position:0%
with a commitment to Quality and to
 
00:43:35.510 --> 00:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
short-term placement to ensure that kids
 
00:43:36.750 --> 00:43:36.760 align:start position:0%
are getting back to their homes and
 
00:43:39.349 --> 00:43:39.359 align:start position:0%
communities um with as many uh supports
 
00:43:41.430 --> 00:43:41.440 align:start position:0%
and as as promising a future as possible
 
00:43:43.150 --> 00:43:43.160 align:start position:0%
so really proud of our team and the
 
00:43:44.950 --> 00:43:44.960 align:start position:0%
progress that they're making on both
 
00:43:47.030 --> 00:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
fronts building a residential
 
00:43:48.870 --> 00:43:48.880 align:start position:0%
architecturally secure therapeutically
 
00:43:51.190 --> 00:43:51.200 align:start position:0%
oriented facility for our Juvenile
 
00:43:52.950 --> 00:43:52.960 align:start position:0%
Justice population that requires
 
00:43:55.309 --> 00:43:55.319 align:start position:0%
detention or commitment and also
 
00:43:57.230 --> 00:43:57.240 align:start position:0%
strengthening our oversight the
 
00:43:59.109 --> 00:43:59.119 align:start position:0%
residential treatment facilities on
 
00:44:00.990 --> 00:44:01.000 align:start position:0%
which we will continue to rely less and
 
00:44:02.390 --> 00:44:02.400 align:start position:0%
less as we come up with Community
 
00:44:04.349 --> 00:44:04.359 align:start position:0%
Alternatives probably more like 1 minute
 
00:44:07.109 --> 00:44:07.119 align:start position:0%
and 40 seconds but 1 minute and 23
 
00:44:09.230 --> 00:44:09.240 align:start position:0%
seconds but who any any questions before
 
00:44:12.990 --> 00:44:13.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:21.109 --> 00:44:21.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:41.710 --> 00:44:41.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:43.109 --> 00:44:43.119 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman I didn't mean
 
00:44:44.990 --> 00:44:45.000 align:start position:0%
to be presumptuous and just coming up
 
00:44:47.030 --> 00:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
but no you were covering for me because
 
00:44:48.670 --> 00:44:48.680 align:start position:0%
I was trying to find my place and I just
 
00:44:50.710 --> 00:44:50.720 align:start position:0%
doubted myself but thank you well yeah
 
00:44:52.150 --> 00:44:52.160 align:start position:0%
we're we'll keep you on track Mr
 
00:44:54.230 --> 00:44:54.240 align:start position:0%
chairman no worries for the record DJ
 
00:44:55.549 --> 00:44:55.559 align:start position:0%
beton Court commissioner of the New
 
00:44:57.430 --> 00:44:57.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire insurance department Kirk
 
00:44:59.109 --> 00:44:59.119 align:start position:0%
Williamson the executive director of the
 
00:45:00.910 --> 00:45:00.920 align:start position:0%
prescription drug affordability
 
00:45:03.510 --> 00:45:03.520 align:start position:0%
board so we are pleased to join you this
 
00:45:05.870 --> 00:45:05.880 align:start position:0%
morning to discuss the redundancy
 
00:45:09.030 --> 00:45:09.040 align:start position:0%
elimination report I would note at the
 
00:45:11.790 --> 00:45:11.800 align:start position:0%
outset that unfortunately I do apologize
 
00:45:14.750 --> 00:45:14.760 align:start position:0%
that our uh resident and I say this with
 
00:45:18.510 --> 00:45:18.520 align:start position:0%
the utmost admiration uh and kindness
 
00:45:22.109 --> 00:45:22.119 align:start position:0%
our resident data geek Dr Jason AIS who
 
00:45:24.109 --> 00:45:24.119 align:start position:0%
is the director of our data analytics
 
00:45:28.630 --> 00:45:28.640 align:start position:0%
unit unfortunately is away today so
 
00:45:31.069 --> 00:45:31.079 align:start position:0%
you're stuck with me I will highlight
 
00:45:34.069 --> 00:45:34.079 align:start position:0%
what I think are the uh pertinent
 
00:45:36.510 --> 00:45:36.520 align:start position:0%
aspects of this report in the best
 
00:45:39.750 --> 00:45:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:43.349 --> 00:45:43.359 align:start position:0%
it do we have a handout of some
 
00:45:48.069 --> 00:45:48.079 align:start position:0%
sort oh coincidentally
 
00:45:50.630 --> 00:45:50.640 align:start position:0%
yes all
 
00:45:54.950 --> 00:45:54.960 align:start position:0%
right got it wonderful so as I was
 
00:45:57.030 --> 00:45:57.040 align:start position:0%
saying I will do my best to hit what I
 
00:45:58.670 --> 00:45:58.680 align:start position:0%
think are the highlights in the best
 
00:46:01.829 --> 00:46:01.839 align:start position:0%
manner possible which is to say the uh
 
00:46:04.150 --> 00:46:04.160 align:start position:0%
to the extent that I understand all of
 
00:46:07.349 --> 00:46:07.359 align:start position:0%
this and if Dr AES doesn't like it well
 
00:46:09.950 --> 00:46:09.960 align:start position:0%
don't go on vacation next time when
 
00:46:12.309 --> 00:46:12.319 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to be here uh so and
 
00:46:13.790 --> 00:46:13.800 align:start position:0%
then and then obviously I'll turn it
 
00:46:16.190 --> 00:46:16.200 align:start position:0%
over you can declare him
 
00:46:19.430 --> 00:46:19.440 align:start position:0%
redundant certainly not I'm more likely
 
00:46:21.910 --> 00:46:21.920 align:start position:0%
to be found redundant than him uh but in
 
00:46:24.270 --> 00:46:24.280 align:start position:0%
any event this report came about as a
 
00:46:27.589 --> 00:46:27.599 align:start position:0%
result of a legislative request which is
 
00:46:29.670 --> 00:46:29.680 align:start position:0%
to say you all put it in statute which
 
00:46:33.030 --> 00:46:33.040 align:start position:0%
required us to do it and so Dr AES and
 
00:46:35.150 --> 00:46:35.160 align:start position:0%
his team really did throw themselves
 
00:46:38.829 --> 00:46:38.839 align:start position:0%
into this work Dr azis had the benefit
 
00:46:41.870 --> 00:46:41.880 align:start position:0%
of also serving as a member of PAB and
 
00:46:44.430 --> 00:46:44.440 align:start position:0%
so he was able to bring that background
 
00:46:46.870 --> 00:46:46.880 align:start position:0%
and that experience uh to bear in
 
00:46:50.270 --> 00:46:50.280 align:start position:0%
putting this together so at its root the
 
00:46:53.470 --> 00:46:53.480 align:start position:0%
purpose of this report was to identify
 
00:46:56.069 --> 00:46:56.079 align:start position:0%
and describe relevant oversight and or
 
00:46:58.390 --> 00:46:58.400 align:start position:0%
regulatory redundancies with regard to
 
00:47:01.270 --> 00:47:01.280 align:start position:0%
the collection analysis and Reporting on
 
00:47:03.710 --> 00:47:03.720 align:start position:0%
prescription drug prices among the
 
00:47:05.390 --> 00:47:05.400 align:start position:0%
Department of Insurance in the New
 
00:47:07.230 --> 00:47:07.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire pdab
 
00:47:10.349 --> 00:47:10.359 align:start position:0%
board I'm pleased to say that to my
 
00:47:12.910 --> 00:47:12.920 align:start position:0%
reading and my understanding what you
 
00:47:14.630 --> 00:47:14.640 align:start position:0%
see reflected in this
 
00:47:18.630 --> 00:47:18.640 align:start position:0%
report is about 80% consensus between
 
00:47:21.390 --> 00:47:21.400 align:start position:0%
the department and the pdab board there
 
00:47:24.750 --> 00:47:24.760 align:start position:0%
are some areas of diverging views and
 
00:47:27.470 --> 00:47:27.480 align:start position:0%
that's perfectly fine at the end of the
 
00:47:29.829 --> 00:47:29.839 align:start position:0%
day when it comes to this report I take
 
00:47:32.309 --> 00:47:32.319 align:start position:0%
the same attitude that I take anytime I
 
00:47:34.710 --> 00:47:34.720 align:start position:0%
appear before a legislative body which
 
00:47:37.270 --> 00:47:37.280 align:start position:0%
is to say we have put forward what we
 
00:47:39.710 --> 00:47:39.720 align:start position:0%
think is good work we have put forward
 
00:47:43.309 --> 00:47:43.319 align:start position:0%
what we think are solid recommendations
 
00:47:46.510 --> 00:47:46.520 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day it is up to you as
 
00:47:48.910 --> 00:47:48.920 align:start position:0%
the legislature as the policy makers to
 
00:47:51.589 --> 00:47:51.599 align:start position:0%
decide what you do and do not want to
 
00:47:54.589 --> 00:47:54.599 align:start position:0%
consider and or move forward with but
 
00:47:56.630 --> 00:47:56.640 align:start position:0%
this is the information uh that we've
 
00:47:59.549 --> 00:47:59.559 align:start position:0%
put before you do with that what you
 
00:48:02.829 --> 00:48:02.839 align:start position:0%
will and so again some of the highlights
 
00:48:05.829 --> 00:48:05.839 align:start position:0%
the first Focus was on data collection
 
00:48:07.910 --> 00:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
and you cannot have that particular
 
00:48:10.270 --> 00:48:10.280 align:start position:0%
conversation without first acknowledging
 
00:48:13.270 --> 00:48:13.280 align:start position:0%
the fact that the department has access
 
00:48:14.630 --> 00:48:14.640 align:start position:0%
as does the Department of Health and
 
00:48:17.150 --> 00:48:17.160 align:start position:0%
Human Services to an incredibly valuable
 
00:48:21.069 --> 00:48:21.079 align:start position:0%
tool the all claims database which is
 
00:48:24.910 --> 00:48:24.920 align:start position:0%
abbreviated to chis so as I've said DHHS
 
00:48:28.069 --> 00:48:28.079 align:start position:0%
has access to this PAB as the result of
 
00:48:30.510 --> 00:48:30.520 align:start position:0%
living kind of under the Department of
 
00:48:33.270 --> 00:48:33.280 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services also has
 
00:48:35.910 --> 00:48:35.920 align:start position:0%
access to that data the data that they
 
00:48:40.150 --> 00:48:40.160 align:start position:0%
may desire via the chis system via the
 
00:48:42.589 --> 00:48:42.599 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
00:48:45.390 --> 00:48:45.400 align:start position:0%
and so the report as you'll see does not
 
00:48:48.710 --> 00:48:48.720 align:start position:0%
see a reason for pdab to have to collect
 
00:48:50.950 --> 00:48:50.960 align:start position:0%
data now I will tell you
 
00:48:53.309 --> 00:48:53.319 align:start position:0%
philosophically that the collection of
 
00:48:56.109 --> 00:48:56.119 align:start position:0%
data on the one hand is unbelievably
 
00:48:56.119 --> 00:48:58.030 align:start position:0%
data on the one hand is unbelievably
important

00:48:58.030 --> 00:48:58.040 align:start position:0%
important
 
00:48:59.990 --> 00:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
but there's a limit to that data in the
 
00:49:03.510 --> 00:49:03.520 align:start position:0%
sense that you can drown yourself in it
 
00:49:05.349 --> 00:49:05.359 align:start position:0%
and so what you want to ensure that
 
00:49:06.990 --> 00:49:07.000 align:start position:0%
you're doing is that you are collecting
 
00:49:08.829 --> 00:49:08.839 align:start position:0%
data that is getting you toward some
 
00:49:10.870 --> 00:49:10.880 align:start position:0%
sort of a policy
 
00:49:12.870 --> 00:49:12.880 align:start position:0%
objective so that's in the first
 
00:49:14.549 --> 00:49:14.559 align:start position:0%
instance in the second instance you want
 
00:49:16.390 --> 00:49:16.400 align:start position:0%
to ensure that the individuals who are
 
00:49:19.710 --> 00:49:19.720 align:start position:0%
taking in and analyzing that data have
 
00:49:21.789 --> 00:49:21.799 align:start position:0%
the ability to understand it otherwise
 
00:49:24.510 --> 00:49:24.520 align:start position:0%
you're just getting numbers in you don't
 
00:49:27.710 --> 00:49:27.720 align:start position:0%
know what it's driving you towards
 
00:49:29.349 --> 00:49:29.359 align:start position:0%
in the best instance in the worst
 
00:49:31.510 --> 00:49:31.520 align:start position:0%
instance you don't understand it and
 
00:49:33.470 --> 00:49:33.480 align:start position:0%
therefore run the risk of having it be
 
00:49:36.630 --> 00:49:36.640 align:start position:0%
something that you make a decision on or
 
00:49:38.670 --> 00:49:38.680 align:start position:0%
begin to formulate thoughts around when
 
00:49:41.309 --> 00:49:41.319 align:start position:0%
you don't actually understand it
 
00:49:44.390 --> 00:49:44.400 align:start position:0%
so again the report would suggest that
 
00:49:47.589 --> 00:49:47.599 align:start position:0%
PAB um would have a very very difficult
 
00:49:50.069 --> 00:49:50.079 align:start position:0%
time if it attempted to try to get into
 
00:49:52.990 --> 00:49:53.000 align:start position:0%
the data collection
 
00:49:55.150 --> 00:49:55.160 align:start position:0%
business again under that headline we
 
00:49:57.789 --> 00:49:57.799 align:start position:0%
would point out the health C tool we
 
00:49:59.510 --> 00:49:59.520 align:start position:0%
always talk about that it's a great
 
00:50:01.750 --> 00:50:01.760 align:start position:0%
asset to Consumers as well as to policy
 
00:50:04.190 --> 00:50:04.200 align:start position:0%
makers and again uh that's a similar
 
00:50:06.589 --> 00:50:06.599 align:start position:0%
resource that should provide pdab with
 
00:50:10.190 --> 00:50:10.200 align:start position:0%
the data that it's looking for so again
 
00:50:12.670 --> 00:50:12.680 align:start position:0%
I understand that there are some who
 
00:50:16.430 --> 00:50:16.440 align:start position:0%
feel that pdab should have access to Raw
 
00:50:18.870 --> 00:50:18.880 align:start position:0%
data rather than the data that they
 
00:50:21.190 --> 00:50:21.200 align:start position:0%
would get via the insurance department
 
00:50:23.030 --> 00:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
or the Department of Health and Human
 
00:50:25.829 --> 00:50:25.839 align:start position:0%
Services again that is a decision for
 
00:50:27.910 --> 00:50:27.920 align:start position:0%
you and the legisl to make as to whether
 
00:50:30.710 --> 00:50:30.720 align:start position:0%
or not you want to give them that access
 
00:50:32.990 --> 00:50:33.000 align:start position:0%
again I would highlight two issues the
 
00:50:36.870 --> 00:50:36.880 align:start position:0%
first is again that comprehension piece
 
00:50:40.390 --> 00:50:40.400 align:start position:0%
uh how to best understand and interpret
 
00:50:43.069 --> 00:50:43.079 align:start position:0%
the raw data that you're getting that
 
00:50:45.349 --> 00:50:45.359 align:start position:0%
may very well be surmountable depending
 
00:50:46.990 --> 00:50:47.000 align:start position:0%
on the experience of the individual
 
00:50:50.829 --> 00:50:50.839 align:start position:0%
members making up pdab but you also have
 
00:50:53.750 --> 00:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
a pretty significant legal consideration
 
00:50:55.950 --> 00:50:55.960 align:start position:0%
to think through which is a lot of the
 
00:50:57.990 --> 00:50:58.000 align:start position:0%
raw data that exists Within These
 
00:51:01.910 --> 00:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
systems is proprietary data and so who
 
00:51:05.789 --> 00:51:05.799 align:start position:0%
has access to that data is very very
 
00:51:08.470 --> 00:51:08.480 align:start position:0%
carefully considered and and we'll get
 
00:51:11.829 --> 00:51:11.839 align:start position:0%
to that in a little bit so the second
 
00:51:14.789 --> 00:51:14.799 align:start position:0%
big piece of the report surrounds PBM
 
00:51:18.030 --> 00:51:18.040 align:start position:0%
reporting and I will admit that prior to
 
00:51:21.230 --> 00:51:21.240 align:start position:0%
the passage of Senate Bill 555 earlier
 
00:51:21.240 --> 00:51:22.069 align:start position:0%
the passage of Senate Bill 555 earlier
this

00:51:22.069 --> 00:51:22.079 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:51:25.230 --> 00:51:25.240 align:start position:0%
year um the department quite frankly did
 
00:51:27.589 --> 00:51:27.599 align:start position:0%
not have the tools that we needed to be
 
00:51:30.549 --> 00:51:30.559 align:start position:0%
able to get information that was useful
 
00:51:33.349 --> 00:51:33.359 align:start position:0%
not only to all of you as policy makers
 
00:51:35.990 --> 00:51:36.000 align:start position:0%
but useful to us as a department I was
 
00:51:39.470 --> 00:51:39.480 align:start position:0%
stunned when the first reporting
 
00:51:42.870 --> 00:51:42.880 align:start position:0%
requirement under the previous statute
 
00:51:45.829 --> 00:51:45.839 align:start position:0%
came up and legislators were asking me
 
00:51:47.270 --> 00:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
for the reports others were asking me
 
00:51:48.950 --> 00:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
for the reports and I said I need to see
 
00:51:50.829 --> 00:51:50.839 align:start position:0%
these reports and what I would get back
 
00:51:53.710 --> 00:51:53.720 align:start position:0%
are these one or two page
 
00:51:56.069 --> 00:51:56.079 align:start position:0%
attestations that told me absolutely
 
00:51:58.270 --> 00:51:58.280 align:start position:0%
nothing and therefore we're not going to
 
00:52:00.950 --> 00:52:00.960 align:start position:0%
be at all helpful to you and Senate Bill
 
00:52:04.309 --> 00:52:04.319 align:start position:0%
555 thankfully gave us the regulatory
 
00:52:06.510 --> 00:52:06.520 align:start position:0%
teeth that we need to get the
 
00:52:09.030 --> 00:52:09.040 align:start position:0%
information from the pbms that is going
 
00:52:12.150 --> 00:52:12.160 align:start position:0%
to be useful to us and ultimately useful
 
00:52:14.710 --> 00:52:14.720 align:start position:0%
to all of you as well but as a
 
00:52:18.309 --> 00:52:18.319 align:start position:0%
consequence of that Senate Bill 555 did
 
00:52:20.430 --> 00:52:20.440 align:start position:0%
create some redundancies that were not
 
00:52:23.870 --> 00:52:23.880 align:start position:0%
anticipated prior to the final version
 
00:52:26.870 --> 00:52:26.880 align:start position:0%
of Senate Bill 555 being finalized in
 
00:52:29.349 --> 00:52:29.359 align:start position:0%
Nei June or July I can't quite
 
00:52:31.670 --> 00:52:31.680 align:start position:0%
recall again I would highlight at this
 
00:52:34.870 --> 00:52:34.880 align:start position:0%
point and this I think is pertinent not
 
00:52:36.910 --> 00:52:36.920 align:start position:0%
only to this report but I think to the
 
00:52:40.309 --> 00:52:40.319 align:start position:0%
discussion of PAB and prescription drug
 
00:52:42.470 --> 00:52:42.480 align:start position:0%
data collection RIT
 
00:52:45.109 --> 00:52:45.119 align:start position:0%
large believe you me I am very
 
00:52:47.670 --> 00:52:47.680 align:start position:0%
frustrated sometimes in this position by
 
00:52:49.950 --> 00:52:49.960 align:start position:0%
the information that I am and am not
 
00:52:52.030 --> 00:52:52.040 align:start position:0%
legally permitted to
 
00:52:54.390 --> 00:52:54.400 align:start position:0%
disclose and when you are talking about
 
00:52:58.710 --> 00:52:58.720 align:start position:0%
PBM related items there is a lot of
 
00:53:01.710 --> 00:53:01.720 align:start position:0%
protection for proprietary
 
00:53:04.270 --> 00:53:04.280 align:start position:0%
information in the consequence of
 
00:53:06.589 --> 00:53:06.599 align:start position:0%
disclosing any of that proprietary
 
00:53:09.910 --> 00:53:09.920 align:start position:0%
information is that I or any individual
 
00:53:13.990 --> 00:53:14.000 align:start position:0%
who would disclose it becomes personally
 
00:53:17.950 --> 00:53:17.960 align:start position:0%
liable personally liable under the law
 
00:53:20.710 --> 00:53:20.720 align:start position:0%
to suffer the potential
 
00:53:23.470 --> 00:53:23.480 align:start position:0%
consequences of disclosing information
 
00:53:24.950 --> 00:53:24.960 align:start position:0%
that I'm not and I can assure you that
 
00:53:27.430 --> 00:53:27.440 align:start position:0%
the aeton court family budget does not
 
00:53:30.109 --> 00:53:30.119 align:start position:0%
have the capacity to defend uh any sort
 
00:53:33.470 --> 00:53:33.480 align:start position:0%
of a prosecution or lawsuit coming from
 
00:53:35.069 --> 00:53:35.079 align:start position:0%
a PBM or
 
00:53:37.710 --> 00:53:37.720 align:start position:0%
otherwise and I appreciate the fact that
 
00:53:40.309 --> 00:53:40.319 align:start position:0%
this generates a lot of frustration a
 
00:53:42.510 --> 00:53:42.520 align:start position:0%
lot of frustration for the legislature a
 
00:53:45.190 --> 00:53:45.200 align:start position:0%
lot of frustration for pdab we do the
 
00:53:47.910 --> 00:53:47.920 align:start position:0%
very best we can to be as transparent
 
00:53:51.870 --> 00:53:51.880 align:start position:0%
and forthcoming with the aggregated data
 
00:53:55.430 --> 00:53:55.440 align:start position:0%
that we are permitted to make available
 
00:53:57.109 --> 00:53:57.119 align:start position:0%
and so again I think those those
 
00:54:00.430 --> 00:54:00.440 align:start position:0%
proprietary and and privacy protections
 
00:54:02.950 --> 00:54:02.960 align:start position:0%
are a very pertinent issue that again
 
00:54:05.750 --> 00:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
crops up not only in terms of this
 
00:54:09.470 --> 00:54:09.480 align:start position:0%
report but again as it pertains to pdab
 
00:54:12.030 --> 00:54:12.040 align:start position:0%
as a whole the next item I would
 
00:54:15.030 --> 00:54:15.040 align:start position:0%
highlight is the drug manufacturer price
 
00:54:17.789 --> 00:54:17.799 align:start position:0%
reporting the issue there centers around
 
00:54:20.630 --> 00:54:20.640 align:start position:0%
the fact that both PAB and the insurance
 
00:54:23.030 --> 00:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
department have the authority to collect
 
00:54:26.069 --> 00:54:26.079 align:start position:0%
this data the question is a matter of
 
00:54:29.270 --> 00:54:29.280 align:start position:0%
who is going to do this work and who is
 
00:54:31.470 --> 00:54:31.480 align:start position:0%
more or I should say who is better
 
00:54:34.470 --> 00:54:34.480 align:start position:0%
positioned to do this work so the
 
00:54:36.549 --> 00:54:36.559 align:start position:0%
department right now has the experience
 
00:54:38.230 --> 00:54:38.240 align:start position:0%
we have the staff we have the resources
 
00:54:40.950 --> 00:54:40.960 align:start position:0%
to do it if you wanted pdab to do it
 
00:54:43.510 --> 00:54:43.520 align:start position:0%
that again is your decision and we'll
 
00:54:46.309 --> 00:54:46.319 align:start position:0%
abide by whatever you decide but it
 
00:54:49.069 --> 00:54:49.079 align:start position:0%
would require um a lot of staff and a
 
00:54:51.789 --> 00:54:51.799 align:start position:0%
lot of resources PAB would have to I
 
00:54:54.270 --> 00:54:54.280 align:start position:0%
would think bring on quite a few people
 
00:54:56.990 --> 00:54:57.000 align:start position:0%
to come help and so
 
00:54:58.750 --> 00:54:58.760 align:start position:0%
again that the redundancy there is we
 
00:55:00.549 --> 00:55:00.559 align:start position:0%
both have the authority that's not a
 
00:55:03.230 --> 00:55:03.240 align:start position:0%
question the question is who is better
 
00:55:05.789 --> 00:55:05.799 align:start position:0%
positioned and who would you prefer to
 
00:55:06.870 --> 00:55:06.880 align:start position:0%
do that
 
00:55:10.150 --> 00:55:10.160 align:start position:0%
work so uh the last piece of that I
 
00:55:12.510 --> 00:55:12.520 align:start position:0%
would also mention is that we are
 
00:55:15.910 --> 00:55:15.920 align:start position:0%
currently required to report this data
 
00:55:18.510 --> 00:55:18.520 align:start position:0%
to the Board of Pharmacy so if you
 
00:55:20.349 --> 00:55:20.359 align:start position:0%
decide ultimately that you wanted pdab
 
00:55:24.549 --> 00:55:24.559 align:start position:0%
to do this work don't forget to uh have
 
00:55:26.349 --> 00:55:26.359 align:start position:0%
them take on the responsibility for
 
00:55:28.029 --> 00:55:28.039 align:start position:0%
reporting it over to the Board of
 
00:55:31.390 --> 00:55:31.400 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy and taking it away from us so I
 
00:55:33.230 --> 00:55:33.240 align:start position:0%
think I've gone on quite long enough and
 
00:55:35.470 --> 00:55:35.480 align:start position:0%
I'll turn it over to my colleague here
 
00:55:37.549 --> 00:55:37.559 align:start position:0%
who is uh much smarter than I am on all
 
00:55:40.270 --> 00:55:40.280 align:start position:0%
of this so you can ask him all the tough
 
00:55:41.670 --> 00:55:41.680 align:start position:0%
questions and you can save the easy ones
 
00:55:45.230 --> 00:55:45.240 align:start position:0%
for me thank you Mr chairman no no no um
 
00:55:47.230 --> 00:55:47.240 align:start position:0%
thank you all for having me here um I do
 
00:55:50.029 --> 00:55:50.039 align:start position:0%
want to say um I we really appreciate as
 
00:55:51.630 --> 00:55:51.640 align:start position:0%
a board being able to collaborate with
 
00:55:53.190 --> 00:55:53.200 align:start position:0%
the insurance department I think that
 
00:55:55.670 --> 00:55:55.680 align:start position:0%
was key in getting this report across a
 
00:55:57.109 --> 00:55:57.119 align:start position:0%
Finish Line
 
00:55:59.069 --> 00:55:59.079 align:start position:0%
um and collaboration is crucial
 
00:56:01.109 --> 00:56:01.119 align:start position:0%
particularly with such a nuanced and
 
00:56:04.829 --> 00:56:04.839 align:start position:0%
complex issue um of such an opaque
 
00:56:08.470 --> 00:56:08.480 align:start position:0%
nature as prescription drug
 
00:56:11.069 --> 00:56:11.079 align:start position:0%
prices oh and I can remind you for the
 
00:56:12.470 --> 00:56:12.480 align:start position:0%
record I'm Kirk Williamson I'm the
 
00:56:14.549 --> 00:56:14.559 align:start position:0%
executive director of the prescription
 
00:56:16.990 --> 00:56:17.000 align:start position:0%
drug affordability board I'll say that
 
00:56:19.069 --> 00:56:19.079 align:start position:0%
the report did serve as an important
 
00:56:21.349 --> 00:56:21.359 align:start position:0%
moment of reflection I think it allowed
 
00:56:23.710 --> 00:56:23.720 align:start position:0%
us to systematically look across the
 
00:56:25.630 --> 00:56:25.640 align:start position:0%
state and see where we are collecting
 
00:56:28.069 --> 00:56:28.079 align:start position:0%
data where different data is housed
 
00:56:30.069 --> 00:56:30.079 align:start position:0%
whether it's in the apcd whether it's
 
00:56:32.230 --> 00:56:32.240 align:start position:0%
contained in the insurance department
 
00:56:35.150 --> 00:56:35.160 align:start position:0%
and whether the pdab has the existing um
 
00:56:37.750 --> 00:56:37.760 align:start position:0%
Authority orus in place to access that
 
00:56:41.470 --> 00:56:41.480 align:start position:0%
data to fulfill its Mission um the board
 
00:56:43.950 --> 00:56:43.960 align:start position:0%
did vote this year as part of its goals
 
00:56:46.950 --> 00:56:46.960 align:start position:0%
for 2025 to execute anou with the
 
00:56:48.829 --> 00:56:48.839 align:start position:0%
insurance department so that we can
 
00:56:51.470 --> 00:56:51.480 align:start position:0%
eliminate any redundancies and leverage
 
00:56:54.069 --> 00:56:54.079 align:start position:0%
everybody's shared work um of course
 
00:56:55.510 --> 00:56:55.520 align:start position:0%
there are protections that would need to
 
00:56:57.829 --> 00:56:57.839 align:start position:0%
be built in place place um particularly
 
00:57:00.510 --> 00:57:00.520 align:start position:0%
if we are accessing net price data or
 
00:57:03.910 --> 00:57:03.920 align:start position:0%
anything around rebates um and I would
 
00:57:06.430 --> 00:57:06.440 align:start position:0%
say that um you know because this is
 
00:57:08.309 --> 00:57:08.319 align:start position:0%
such a complex issue that we are
 
00:57:10.870 --> 00:57:10.880 align:start position:0%
interested in working with all agencies
 
00:57:13.430 --> 00:57:13.440 align:start position:0%
we have anou in place with HHS so that
 
00:57:16.589 --> 00:57:16.599 align:start position:0%
we can access chiz data we are um we
 
00:57:18.349 --> 00:57:18.359 align:start position:0%
have a goal to execute one with the
 
00:57:20.390 --> 00:57:20.400 align:start position:0%
insurance department which again shows
 
00:57:22.430 --> 00:57:22.440 align:start position:0%
our uh collaborative nature to tackling
 
00:57:25.270 --> 00:57:25.280 align:start position:0%
this issue for granite Staters um I
 
00:57:27.510 --> 00:57:27.520 align:start position:0%
think it's also important to remind the
 
00:57:29.549 --> 00:57:29.559 align:start position:0%
members that the insurance department
 
00:57:32.150 --> 00:57:32.160 align:start position:0%
and the PAB play distinct but
 
00:57:34.829 --> 00:57:34.839 align:start position:0%
complimentary roles um in addressing
 
00:57:36.589 --> 00:57:36.599 align:start position:0%
prescription drug affordability and I
 
00:57:39.589 --> 00:57:39.599 align:start position:0%
think our ability to meet we met last
 
00:57:41.549 --> 00:57:41.559 align:start position:0%
week to discuss a lot of these issues
 
00:57:43.870 --> 00:57:43.880 align:start position:0%
and I think that through theou we're
 
00:57:45.910 --> 00:57:45.920 align:start position:0%
able to eliminate any possible
 
00:57:48.390 --> 00:57:48.400 align:start position:0%
redundancies um and continue this work
 
00:57:51.150 --> 00:57:51.160 align:start position:0%
um with Vigor um I'll pause there um I
 
00:57:52.870 --> 00:57:52.880 align:start position:0%
know we've been speaking for a while so
 
00:57:56.829 --> 00:57:56.839 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to answer any questions
 
00:57:59.349 --> 00:57:59.359 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant thank you Mr
 
00:58:00.670 --> 00:58:00.680 align:start position:0%
chair and also thank you to both of you
 
00:58:04.190 --> 00:58:04.200 align:start position:0%
being here today um I'm sort of uh just
 
00:58:05.870 --> 00:58:05.880 align:start position:0%
for the record I also the chair of the
 
00:58:07.430 --> 00:58:07.440 align:start position:0%
prescription portability board so I want
 
00:58:09.589 --> 00:58:09.599 align:start position:0%
to be clear about where I'm coming from
 
00:58:11.190 --> 00:58:11.200 align:start position:0%
one of the things we talked about before
 
00:58:13.069 --> 00:58:13.079 align:start position:0%
I think commissioner Benton Court you
 
00:58:15.230 --> 00:58:15.240 align:start position:0%
talked about this is data
 
00:58:19.150 --> 00:58:19.160 align:start position:0%
collection when I was at Mary Hitchcock
 
00:58:20.990 --> 00:58:21.000 align:start position:0%
we started out with every Department not
 
00:58:22.710 --> 00:58:22.720 align:start position:0%
every a lot of departments collecting
 
00:58:25.390 --> 00:58:25.400 align:start position:0%
data what we migrated to was a data
 
00:58:28.470 --> 00:58:28.480 align:start position:0%
warehouse so that we had an entity
 
00:58:30.069 --> 00:58:30.079 align:start position:0%
within the organization that knew how to
 
00:58:32.750 --> 00:58:32.760 align:start position:0%
collect data so the Departments would
 
00:58:34.910 --> 00:58:34.920 align:start position:0%
then work with them to what data they
 
00:58:37.190 --> 00:58:37.200 align:start position:0%
needed to have and then the data
 
00:58:39.230 --> 00:58:39.240 align:start position:0%
warehouse would collect the data on
 
00:58:42.589 --> 00:58:42.599 align:start position:0%
their behalf is there any somewhere in
 
00:58:43.750 --> 00:58:43.760 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire are we
 
00:58:45.549 --> 00:58:45.559 align:start position:0%
working towards a comparable data
 
00:58:48.029 --> 00:58:48.039 align:start position:0%
warehouse because I do agree that
 
00:58:50.069 --> 00:58:50.079 align:start position:0%
collecting data and how you go about
 
00:58:53.150 --> 00:58:53.160 align:start position:0%
doing it the process itself can be
 
00:58:55.829 --> 00:58:55.839 align:start position:0%
honorous and it has to be done correctly
 
00:58:57.910 --> 00:58:57.920 align:start position:0%
but have redundancy again if we're
 
00:58:59.510 --> 00:58:59.520 align:start position:0%
having different agencies collecting
 
00:59:02.309 --> 00:59:02.319 align:start position:0%
data are we not by default creating
 
00:59:04.309 --> 00:59:04.319 align:start position:0%
redundancy in the data collection versus
 
00:59:06.750 --> 00:59:06.760 align:start position:0%
having a central Data Warehouse in the
 
00:59:08.470 --> 00:59:08.480 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire well I think a
 
00:59:10.910 --> 00:59:10.920 align:start position:0%
lot of that depends on which agency has
 
00:59:13.349 --> 00:59:13.359 align:start position:0%
the authority to collect which data and
 
00:59:15.190 --> 00:59:15.200 align:start position:0%
which data Falls underneath the mission
 
00:59:17.710 --> 00:59:17.720 align:start position:0%
statement of the particular agency so
 
00:59:19.510 --> 00:59:19.520 align:start position:0%
obviously the focus of the insurance
 
00:59:22.069 --> 00:59:22.079 align:start position:0%
department is different than say the
 
00:59:23.470 --> 00:59:23.480 align:start position:0%
mission of the Department of Health and
 
00:59:25.630 --> 00:59:25.640 align:start position:0%
Human Services we have access to
 
00:59:28.069 --> 00:59:28.079 align:start position:0%
different dat we have different focuses
 
00:59:29.670 --> 00:59:29.680 align:start position:0%
but I agree with you to have it in one
 
00:59:31.950 --> 00:59:31.960 align:start position:0%
centralized location is incredibly
 
00:59:34.750 --> 00:59:34.760 align:start position:0%
beneficial and dare I say efficient and
 
00:59:36.710 --> 00:59:36.720 align:start position:0%
I think that ultimately that's the ver
 
00:59:39.470 --> 00:59:39.480 align:start position:0%
that's the vision that we all have for
 
00:59:42.150 --> 00:59:42.160 align:start position:0%
the all claims database that is database
 
00:59:44.470 --> 00:59:44.480 align:start position:0%
system and we take it very very
 
00:59:46.390 --> 00:59:46.400 align:start position:0%
seriously we want that to be an
 
00:59:49.910 --> 00:59:49.920 align:start position:0%
incredibly useful uh and Powerful tool
 
00:59:52.270 --> 00:59:52.280 align:start position:0%
for not only the agencies to leverage
 
00:59:54.630 --> 00:59:54.640 align:start position:0%
But ultimately for all of you to be able
 
00:59:56.670 --> 00:59:56.680 align:start position:0%
to leverage as well and it's the reason
 
00:59:59.309 --> 00:59:59.319 align:start position:0%
why when the department did a when the
 
01:00:01.150 --> 01:00:01.160 align:start position:0%
insurance department did a recent
 
01:00:03.349 --> 01:00:03.359 align:start position:0%
reorganization of our operations we
 
01:00:06.150 --> 01:00:06.160 align:start position:0%
created a separate data analytics unit
 
01:00:08.270 --> 01:00:08.280 align:start position:0%
and part of their mission is to look at
 
01:00:10.789 --> 01:00:10.799 align:start position:0%
how we can enhance the all claims
 
01:00:12.670 --> 01:00:12.680 align:start position:0%
database System including how we can
 
01:00:15.750 --> 01:00:15.760 align:start position:0%
enhance it to collect information around
 
01:00:19.190 --> 01:00:19.200 align:start position:0%
pbms and prescription drugs so
 
01:00:22.630 --> 01:00:22.640 align:start position:0%
designating one agency to be the sole
 
01:00:25.670 --> 01:00:25.680 align:start position:0%
agency that oversees and plugs data into
 
01:00:25.680 --> 01:00:26.510 align:start position:0%
agency that oversees and plugs data into
chin

01:00:26.510 --> 01:00:26.520 align:start position:0%
chin
 
01:00:27.950 --> 01:00:27.960 align:start position:0%
I think would be problematic for the
 
01:00:30.190 --> 01:00:30.200 align:start position:0%
reasons I've described but having that
 
01:00:34.190 --> 01:00:34.200 align:start position:0%
one system I think that's very
 
01:00:37.470 --> 01:00:37.480 align:start position:0%
beneficial follow up thanks thank you
 
01:00:41.029 --> 01:00:41.039 align:start position:0%
for that commissioner so I want to be
 
01:00:44.589 --> 01:00:44.599 align:start position:0%
clear you're not saying that the board
 
01:00:46.309 --> 01:00:46.319 align:start position:0%
should not have authority to collect
 
01:00:47.950 --> 01:00:47.960 align:start position:0%
data but you're talking about trying to
 
01:00:50.190 --> 01:00:50.200 align:start position:0%
find a way to collect the data on behalf
 
01:00:51.430 --> 01:00:51.440 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:00:54.510 --> 01:00:54.520 align:start position:0%
board so I think the question becomes
 
01:00:57.190 --> 01:00:57.200 align:start position:0%
what do you have the capacity to take on
 
01:00:59.710 --> 01:00:59.720 align:start position:0%
and if you're going to take on trying to
 
01:00:59.720 --> 01:01:00.870 align:start position:0%
and if you're going to take on trying to
collect

01:01:00.870 --> 01:01:00.880 align:start position:0%
collect
 
01:01:03.990 --> 01:01:04.000 align:start position:0%
data I think you need to ensure that
 
01:01:06.069 --> 01:01:06.079 align:start position:0%
that data is not already being collected
 
01:01:07.789 --> 01:01:07.799 align:start position:0%
by either the insurance department or
 
01:01:09.589 --> 01:01:09.599 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health and Human
 
01:01:12.789 --> 01:01:12.799 align:start position:0%
Services and then how do you navigate
 
01:01:14.190 --> 01:01:14.200 align:start position:0%
the fact that you're going to need to
 
01:01:16.190 --> 01:01:16.200 align:start position:0%
bring to be level of expertise to be
 
01:01:17.789 --> 01:01:17.799 align:start position:0%
able to understand the data that's in
 
01:01:20.109 --> 01:01:20.119 align:start position:0%
front of you and what legal protections
 
01:01:22.109 --> 01:01:22.119 align:start position:0%
are you going to put in place should the
 
01:01:23.670 --> 01:01:23.680 align:start position:0%
data that you're attempting to collect
 
01:01:25.950 --> 01:01:25.960 align:start position:0%
be considered proprietary I think I
 
01:01:28.470 --> 01:01:28.480 align:start position:0%
think those are tricky issues to kind of
 
01:01:30.549 --> 01:01:30.559 align:start position:0%
work through particularly when you have
 
01:01:33.029 --> 01:01:33.039 align:start position:0%
resources like the expertise you see in
 
01:01:34.630 --> 01:01:34.640 align:start position:0%
the insurance department and the
 
01:01:37.670 --> 01:01:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:40.750 --> 01:01:40.760 align:start position:0%
Services representative Edwards all
 
01:01:42.430 --> 01:01:42.440 align:start position:0%
right so we have you surrounded we have
 
01:01:45.510 --> 01:01:45.520 align:start position:0%
the chair of the pdab here I I'm a I'm a
 
01:01:48.390 --> 01:01:48.400 align:start position:0%
sitting member of the PAB and I think I
 
01:01:50.750 --> 01:01:50.760 align:start position:0%
have another four years in my term for
 
01:01:54.309 --> 01:01:54.319 align:start position:0%
that um and uh I so I've been involved
 
01:01:57.029 --> 01:01:57.039 align:start position:0%
in this redundancy report for it its
 
01:01:59.549 --> 01:01:59.559 align:start position:0%
Inception I appreciate all the work I
 
01:02:02.510 --> 01:02:02.520 align:start position:0%
have worked with Dr ziz he's a great
 
01:02:05.589 --> 01:02:05.599 align:start position:0%
gentleman very smart too smart sometimes
 
01:02:08.430 --> 01:02:08.440 align:start position:0%
but um so just I want to summarize break
 
01:02:11.390 --> 01:02:11.400 align:start position:0%
it down to a simple level uh the result
 
01:02:13.670 --> 01:02:13.680 align:start position:0%
of the redundancy report is that there
 
01:02:16.150 --> 01:02:16.160 align:start position:0%
has been identified some redundancies in
 
01:02:18.510 --> 01:02:18.520 align:start position:0%
the way the pdab was initially
 
01:02:21.269 --> 01:02:21.279 align:start position:0%
legislated and and what the insurance
 
01:02:22.589 --> 01:02:22.599 align:start position:0%
department and probably other
 
01:02:24.309 --> 01:02:24.319 align:start position:0%
Departments of the state are doing so
 
01:02:28.309 --> 01:02:28.319 align:start position:0%
yes there there are redundancies uh two
 
01:02:30.750 --> 01:02:30.760 align:start position:0%
I I think some of the redundancies are
 
01:02:33.630 --> 01:02:33.640 align:start position:0%
significant uh and need to be addressed
 
01:02:36.910 --> 01:02:36.920 align:start position:0%
and and that this summary uh basically
 
01:02:39.430 --> 01:02:39.440 align:start position:0%
creates a list of of the significant
 
01:02:43.269 --> 01:02:43.279 align:start position:0%
ones that but it's not inclusive of all
 
01:02:46.069 --> 01:02:46.079 align:start position:0%
redundancies this is a summary of the
 
01:02:49.109 --> 01:02:49.119 align:start position:0%
significant ones I believe is that true
 
01:02:51.309 --> 01:02:51.319 align:start position:0%
that's correct we wanted to ensure that
 
01:02:52.549 --> 01:02:52.559 align:start position:0%
I mean the report at this point is
 
01:02:55.150 --> 01:02:55.160 align:start position:0%
already at Nine Pages we wanted to
 
01:02:56.549 --> 01:02:56.559 align:start position:0%
provide you with with the ones that we
 
01:02:58.109 --> 01:02:58.119 align:start position:0%
felt were
 
01:03:01.349 --> 01:03:01.359 align:start position:0%
most obvious so so so thank you so
 
01:03:04.870 --> 01:03:04.880 align:start position:0%
knowing that this was coming on uh a few
 
01:03:07.589 --> 01:03:07.599 align:start position:0%
of us legislators have been getting
 
01:03:10.390 --> 01:03:10.400 align:start position:0%
together to try to draft a bill a couple
 
01:03:13.390 --> 01:03:13.400 align:start position:0%
of bills as it turns out to uh
 
01:03:15.870 --> 01:03:15.880 align:start position:0%
anticipate the trajectory of this
 
01:03:18.390 --> 01:03:18.400 align:start position:0%
redundance report and to pick up on it
 
01:03:20.069 --> 01:03:20.079 align:start position:0%
and and try to address some of those
 
01:03:22.710 --> 01:03:22.720 align:start position:0%
redundancies in law specifically you
 
01:03:24.750 --> 01:03:24.760 align:start position:0%
know who's going to collect and store
 
01:03:26.950 --> 01:03:26.960 align:start position:0%
the data and protect the data that that
 
01:03:29.069 --> 01:03:29.079 align:start position:0%
that's something that uh proposed
 
01:03:31.910 --> 01:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
legislation is going to include and so
 
01:03:34.190 --> 01:03:34.200 align:start position:0%
um that that those bills are not uh
 
01:03:37.990 --> 01:03:38.000 align:start position:0%
ready yet to distribute more widely but
 
01:03:41.309 --> 01:03:41.319 align:start position:0%
I would love to be able to send uh you
 
01:03:42.950 --> 01:03:42.960 align:start position:0%
uh and of course Mr Williams you'll just
 
01:03:45.710 --> 01:03:45.720 align:start position:0%
get it automatically but to to to you Mr
 
01:03:48.470 --> 01:03:48.480 align:start position:0%
commissioner the our our proposed
 
01:03:51.349 --> 01:03:51.359 align:start position:0%
legislation so that if if we're Miss if
 
01:03:52.910 --> 01:03:52.920 align:start position:0%
I'm missing something as the prime
 
01:03:55.150 --> 01:03:55.160 align:start position:0%
sponsor that you uh shake and let me
 
01:03:57.390 --> 01:03:57.400 align:start position:0%
know certainly we're happy to do that we
 
01:04:00.510 --> 01:04:00.520 align:start position:0%
do that for legislators all the time and
 
01:04:02.589 --> 01:04:02.599 align:start position:0%
I would say philosophically I think
 
01:04:05.150 --> 01:04:05.160 align:start position:0%
we're all in favor of more efficiency in
 
01:04:06.630 --> 01:04:06.640 align:start position:0%
government I don't think that's a
 
01:04:08.589 --> 01:04:08.599 align:start position:0%
controversial position to take but in
 
01:04:10.470 --> 01:04:10.480 align:start position:0%
terms of the policy decisions those are
 
01:04:12.309 --> 01:04:12.319 align:start position:0%
yours to make but what I would tell you
 
01:04:14.190 --> 01:04:14.200 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards is if you say
 
01:04:16.950 --> 01:04:16.960 align:start position:0%
this is our goal and this is the
 
01:04:19.349 --> 01:04:19.359 align:start position:0%
language that we think gets us to our
 
01:04:21.990 --> 01:04:22.000 align:start position:0%
goal myself and uh the experts within
 
01:04:23.549 --> 01:04:23.559 align:start position:0%
the department will look to make sure
 
01:04:25.309 --> 01:04:25.319 align:start position:0%
that those two things are in alignment
 
01:04:28.029 --> 01:04:28.039 align:start position:0%
yeah and and I and I appreciate followup
 
01:04:30.510 --> 01:04:30.520 align:start position:0%
thanks and I just do appreciate the the
 
01:04:33.150 --> 01:04:33.160 align:start position:0%
the statement that was made that that in
 
01:04:35.349 --> 01:04:35.359 align:start position:0%
the last week you've had discussions
 
01:04:38.470 --> 01:04:38.480 align:start position:0%
about the redundancies and how to ensure
 
01:04:40.630 --> 01:04:40.640 align:start position:0%
the pdab and the other work done by the
 
01:04:43.150 --> 01:04:43.160 align:start position:0%
insurance company department and others
 
01:04:45.630 --> 01:04:45.640 align:start position:0%
are complimentary and not overlapping
 
01:04:47.630 --> 01:04:47.640 align:start position:0%
and so that's that's really been the
 
01:04:49.789 --> 01:04:49.799 align:start position:0%
objective of asking for this redundancy
 
01:04:52.829 --> 01:04:52.839 align:start position:0%
report so so thank you for uh helping us
 
01:04:54.870 --> 01:04:54.880 align:start position:0%
nail The Landing I hope any further
 
01:04:56.789 --> 01:04:56.799 align:start position:0%
questions where running behind our
 
01:04:59.710 --> 01:04:59.720 align:start position:0%
schedule so uh please make them succinct
 
01:05:02.150 --> 01:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
if you have them didto with the answer
 
01:05:04.069 --> 01:05:04.079 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for your members of
 
01:05:04.079 --> 01:05:05.029 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for your members of
the

we did what we were supposed to do and I
 
01:05:53.150 --> 01:05:53.160 align:start position:0%

01:06:10.870 --> 01:06:10.880 align:start position:0%
if if you think it meets the
 
01:06:13.150 --> 01:06:13.160 align:start position:0%
requirements of the of the person asking
 
01:06:15.510 --> 01:06:15.520 align:start position:0%
for it I don't I don't
 
01:06:19.589 --> 01:06:19.599 align:start position:0%
recall I don't I don't so I don't I'm
 
01:06:23.870 --> 01:06:23.880 align:start position:0%
sorry about that um I I remember that we
 
01:06:29.029 --> 01:06:29.039 align:start position:0%
had the discussion um um but and I'm I'm
 
01:06:31.829 --> 01:06:31.839 align:start position:0%
glad to have the
 
01:06:31.839 --> 01:06:34.910 align:start position:0%
glad to have the
information

01:06:34.910 --> 01:06:34.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:37.670 --> 01:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
um I'm trying to recall whether it was
 
01:06:40.750 --> 01:06:40.760 align:start position:0%
in the context of a bill that we had in
 
01:06:42.910 --> 01:06:42.920 align:start position:0%
front of us at at Health and Human
 
01:06:44.309 --> 01:06:44.319 align:start position:0%
Services and I think that that's
 
01:06:46.589 --> 01:06:46.599 align:start position:0%
probably the Genesis of it but I'm very
 
01:06:49.510 --> 01:06:49.520 align:start position:0%
sorry right at the moment I'm not
 
01:06:52.910 --> 01:06:52.920 align:start position:0%
remembering um perhaps director lipin
 
01:06:55.870 --> 01:06:55.880 align:start position:0%
remembers what I remember how the 90%
 
01:06:59.750 --> 01:06:59.760 align:start position:0%
came about and how was represent H um if
 
01:07:02.069 --> 01:07:02.079 align:start position:0%
I'm pronouncing his name correctly
 
01:07:04.750 --> 01:07:04.760 align:start position:0%
suggested that the 9% be tied to the
 
01:07:09.430 --> 01:07:09.440 align:start position:0%
January 1st uh January 2024 rate for
 
01:07:12.390 --> 01:07:12.400 align:start position:0%
Medicare at the time and that's that's I
 
01:07:14.910 --> 01:07:14.920 align:start position:0%
think it probably came about uh that
 
01:07:17.549 --> 01:07:17.559 align:start position:0%
confirming that that's what we did and
 
01:07:23.750 --> 01:07:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:27.549 --> 01:07:27.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:33.829 --> 01:07:33.839 align:start position:0%

one is um uh was was this the funds to
 
01:12:50.669 --> 01:12:50.679 align:start position:0%
set this up uh I I seem to recall it
 
01:12:53.510 --> 01:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
being uh positioned as one-time money
 
01:12:55.750 --> 01:12:55.760 align:start position:0%
and I don't remember if it was Federal
 
01:12:58.390 --> 01:12:58.400 align:start position:0%
art money or something but but is was
 
01:13:00.470 --> 01:13:00.480 align:start position:0%
this in the budget as a one-time
 
01:13:02.950 --> 01:13:02.960 align:start position:0%
investment or or is it
 
01:13:05.790 --> 01:13:05.800 align:start position:0%
ongoing uh currently this campaign and
 
01:13:06.910 --> 01:13:06.920 align:start position:0%

at the time that we were doing this um
 
01:13:26.149 --> 01:13:26.159 align:start position:0%
and this may be for Dr hen um is is that
 
01:13:29.110 --> 01:13:29.120 align:start position:0%

01:13:31.669 --> 01:13:31.679 align:start position:0%
program was going to get set up under
 
01:13:34.310 --> 01:13:34.320 align:start position:0%
your department and that we tried to
 
01:13:36.510 --> 01:13:36.520 align:start position:0%
encourage that you work with the public
 
01:13:39.189 --> 01:13:39.199 align:start position:0%
health people who had a similar public
 
01:13:42.310 --> 01:13:42.320 align:start position:0%
facing Mission and that in this next
 
01:13:46.709 --> 01:13:46.719 align:start position:0%
budget cycle that we were looking at one
 
01:13:50.149 --> 01:13:50.159 align:start position:0%
public facing uh advertising Marketing
 
01:13:53.310 --> 01:13:53.320 align:start position:0%
Group in DHHS and not proliferate in
 
01:13:55.590 --> 01:13:55.600 align:start position:0%
multiple departments or
 
01:13:57.629 --> 01:13:57.639 align:start position:0%
where are we at with making sure that
 
01:14:00.390 --> 01:14:00.400 align:start position:0%
we're aligned and and and we're pinning
 
01:14:02.590 --> 01:14:02.600 align:start position:0%
the rows on one
 
01:14:05.390 --> 01:14:05.400 align:start position:0%
entity um I I'll I'll start and then if
 
01:14:08.510 --> 01:14:08.520 align:start position:0%
MCA has anything to add she can add um
 
01:14:10.590 --> 01:14:10.600 align:start position:0%
many of the materials that we're looking
 
01:14:15.229 --> 01:14:15.239 align:start position:0%
to produce can be uh reproduced um and
 
01:14:17.709 --> 01:14:17.719 align:start position:0%
be done in an ongoing basis because it
 
01:14:21.070 --> 01:14:21.080 align:start position:0%
is brain health um we do expect that
 
01:14:23.070 --> 01:14:23.080 align:start position:0%
we'll have some coordination and
 
01:14:24.709 --> 01:14:24.719 align:start position:0%
collaboration with Public Health in
 
01:14:28.830 --> 01:14:28.840 align:start position:0%
terms of any um resources or funding
 
01:14:31.110 --> 01:14:31.120 align:start position:0%
that we can collaborate on between both
 
01:14:34.390 --> 01:14:34.400 align:start position:0%
our Bureau and uh population Health
 
01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:36.470 align:start position:0%

01:14:41.669 --> 01:14:41.679 align:start position:0%
dph okay so what so so what I think I
 
01:14:43.070 --> 01:14:43.080 align:start position:0%
just heard you say is that you'll
 
01:14:45.070 --> 01:14:45.080 align:start position:0%
continue to remain the subject matter
 
01:14:48.430 --> 01:14:48.440 align:start position:0%
experts to update the materials but that
 
01:14:50.709 --> 01:14:50.719 align:start position:0%
the people who are responsible for
 
01:14:52.470 --> 01:14:52.480 align:start position:0%
coordinating the Contracting and

development and distribution and website
 
01:14:56.470 --> 01:14:56.480 align:start position:0%

would be a partnership between um no I'm
 
01:15:05.669 --> 01:15:05.679 align:start position:0%

in black and white but it does have the
 
01:15:55.189 --> 01:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:56.910 --> 01:15:56.920 align:start position:0%
should be titled developmental
 
01:15:59.790 --> 01:15:59.800 align:start position:0%
disabilities acquired brain disorder yes
 
01:16:01.430 --> 01:16:01.440 align:start position:0%
that is the
 
01:16:01.440 --> 01:16:04.390 align:start position:0%
that is the
one

01:16:04.390 --> 01:16:04.400 align:start position:0%

so as we come again and Report out to
 
01:16:11.790 --> 01:16:11.800 align:start position:0%
this committee we still continue to have
 
01:16:14.390 --> 01:16:14.400 align:start position:0%
no funding weight list but as this
 
01:16:15.950 --> 01:16:15.960 align:start position:0%
committee has expressed an interest as
 
01:16:17.950 --> 01:16:17.960 align:start position:0%
well as the bureau um of Developmental
 
01:16:21.350 --> 01:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
Services we really want to try to focus
 
01:16:23.350 --> 01:16:23.360 align:start position:0%
on who is actually getting those
 
01:16:25.270 --> 01:16:25.280 align:start position:0%
services that have been funded what are
 
01:16:27.430 --> 01:16:27.440 align:start position:0%
the reasons that they might not be are
 
01:16:29.229 --> 01:16:29.239 align:start position:0%
they getting full Services partial
 
01:16:31.750 --> 01:16:31.760 align:start position:0%
services and we really continue to hone
 
01:16:34.430 --> 01:16:34.440 align:start position:0%
our data as some of you may recall last
 
01:16:36.709 --> 01:16:36.719 align:start position:0%
year the New Hampshire lead system that
 
01:16:38.870 --> 01:16:38.880 align:start position:0%
we utilized in partnership with our area
 
01:16:41.830 --> 01:16:41.840 align:start position:0%
agencies was sunset necessarily due to
 
01:16:44.709 --> 01:16:44.719 align:start position:0%
some system issues and we transition to
 
01:16:47.189 --> 01:16:47.199 align:start position:0%
a state operated system New Hampshire
 
01:16:48.629 --> 01:16:48.639 align:start position:0%
easy or sometimes you'll hear it
 
01:16:51.390 --> 01:16:51.400 align:start position:0%
referred to as new heights this is where
 
01:16:54.189 --> 01:16:54.199 align:start position:0%
the information is now logged stored and
 
01:16:57.229 --> 01:16:57.239 align:start position:0%
we are starting to get um I'm proud to
 
01:16:59.070 --> 01:16:59.080 align:start position:0%
say we are starting to get additional
 
01:17:01.830 --> 01:17:01.840 align:start position:0%
and helpful data to start to isolate and
 
01:17:04.270 --> 01:17:04.280 align:start position:0%
Target initiatives and give us
 
01:17:06.270 --> 01:17:06.280 align:start position:0%
information on where we can best align
 
01:17:08.270 --> 01:17:08.280 align:start position:0%
resources and focus efforts and getting
 
01:17:11.790 --> 01:17:11.800 align:start position:0%
people access to their services um also
 
01:17:14.990 --> 01:17:15.000 align:start position:0%
on June 28th or July 1st uh right in
 
01:17:16.950 --> 01:17:16.960 align:start position:0%
that time period we rolled out a couple
 
01:17:19.189 --> 01:17:19.199 align:start position:0%
of pretty significant it enhancements
 
01:17:20.590 --> 01:17:20.600 align:start position:0%
that we had mentioned the last time we
 
01:17:23.709 --> 01:17:23.719 align:start position:0%
came and presented um one was a provider
 
01:17:26.629 --> 01:17:26.639 align:start position:0%
View and access ACC to our New Hampshire
 
01:17:28.590 --> 01:17:28.600 align:start position:0%
easy portal so that they could see the
 
01:17:30.550 --> 01:17:30.560 align:start position:0%
status of those authorizations for
 
01:17:33.790 --> 01:17:33.800 align:start position:0%
services those um that requirement that
 
01:17:35.629 --> 01:17:35.639 align:start position:0%
allows them to bill and be paid for
 
01:17:38.229 --> 01:17:38.239 align:start position:0%
services rendered in addition we've
 
01:17:41.510 --> 01:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
automated the start dates as well um in
 
01:17:43.830 --> 01:17:43.840 align:start position:0%
capturing that data so it's no longer a
 
01:17:46.750 --> 01:17:46.760 align:start position:0%
manual process so based on that service
 
01:17:49.110 --> 01:17:49.120 align:start position:0%
authorization once that's entered the
 
01:17:51.350 --> 01:17:51.360 align:start position:0%
start date is also now logged so that we
 
01:17:53.910 --> 01:17:53.920 align:start position:0%
can start to get more timely data um
 
01:17:55.990 --> 01:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
more point in time data rather on when
 
01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:59.030 align:start position:0%
more point in time data rather on when
Services

01:17:59.030 --> 01:17:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:01.590 --> 01:18:01.600 align:start position:0%
begin also working in partnership with
 
01:18:04.550 --> 01:18:04.560 align:start position:0%
our area agency staff the entry of these
 
01:18:06.709 --> 01:18:06.719 align:start position:0%
delay reasons we've presented and
 
01:18:08.390 --> 01:18:08.400 align:start position:0%
discussed in in previous committee
 
01:18:10.790 --> 01:18:10.800 align:start position:0%
meetings that this was a manual process
 
01:18:12.910 --> 01:18:12.920 align:start position:0%
and given the amount of work and the
 
01:18:14.669 --> 01:18:14.679 align:start position:0%
effort that everyone in our service
 
01:18:17.350 --> 01:18:17.360 align:start position:0%
system was putting forth in prioritizing
 
01:18:18.990 --> 01:18:19.000 align:start position:0%
those payments for services to get
 
01:18:22.270 --> 01:18:22.280 align:start position:0%
individuals faster access to Services we
 
01:18:24.750 --> 01:18:24.760 align:start position:0%
delayed the the manual entry of those
 
01:18:27.950 --> 01:18:27.960 align:start position:0%
Del reasons but as of July 1st we've
 
01:18:30.669 --> 01:18:30.679 align:start position:0%
started uh working and entering that
 
01:18:33.070 --> 01:18:33.080 align:start position:0%
data and it is starting to come in so
 
01:18:34.910 --> 01:18:34.920 align:start position:0%
that we can now include that information
 
01:18:36.709 --> 01:18:36.719 align:start position:0%
on the report that you have in front of
 
01:18:39.669 --> 01:18:39.679 align:start position:0%
you so with that said I'll dive into the
 
01:18:43.229 --> 01:18:43.239 align:start position:0%
report data if that's okay all right so
 
01:18:44.910 --> 01:18:44.920 align:start position:0%
for our developmental disabilities
 
01:18:47.750 --> 01:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
waiver which is our largest waiver we in
 
01:18:50.229 --> 01:18:50.239 align:start position:0%
quarter 4 had 100 individuals who
 
01:18:51.790 --> 01:18:51.800 align:start position:0%
requested to start
 
01:18:54.590 --> 01:18:54.600 align:start position:0%
Services um nine individuals withdrew
 
01:18:56.910 --> 01:18:56.920 align:start position:0%
the request which can happen sometimes
 
01:19:00.910 --> 01:19:00.920 align:start position:0%
so of those 91 remaining individuals 86
 
01:19:03.030 --> 01:19:03.040 align:start position:0%
were projected to start their services
 
01:19:07.110 --> 01:19:07.120 align:start position:0%
within the quarter of those 86 25 began
 
01:19:10.629 --> 01:19:10.639 align:start position:0%
their services and the remaining 61 that
 
01:19:13.310 --> 01:19:13.320 align:start position:0%
did not start their services had delay
 
01:19:15.350 --> 01:19:15.360 align:start position:0%
reasons that are laid out within the
 
01:19:19.390 --> 01:19:19.400 align:start position:0%
report the top three being their in
 
01:19:21.629 --> 01:19:21.639 align:start position:0%
trying to secure a provider agency find
 
01:19:23.669 --> 01:19:23.679 align:start position:0%
a a provider who is able to offer those
 
01:19:25.470 --> 01:19:25.480 align:start position:0%
services in the way the individual was
 
01:19:28.070 --> 01:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
looking for them um individual and
 
01:19:31.110 --> 01:19:31.120 align:start position:0%
family request I I will say given the
 
01:19:33.510 --> 01:19:33.520 align:start position:0%
quarter being quarter 4 because a lot of
 
01:19:34.910 --> 01:19:34.920 align:start position:0%
the folks who are newly requesting
 
01:19:37.390 --> 01:19:37.400 align:start position:0%
services are transitioning out of school
 
01:19:39.669 --> 01:19:39.679 align:start position:0%
it's not uncommon to see a request to
 
01:19:41.830 --> 01:19:41.840 align:start position:0%
delay Services until maybe after the
 
01:19:44.830 --> 01:19:44.840 align:start position:0%
summer um and then the other reason is
 
01:19:46.669 --> 01:19:46.679 align:start position:0%
um folks attempting to access the
 
01:19:48.149 --> 01:19:48.159 align:start position:0%
Medicaid benefit going through the
 
01:19:49.830 --> 01:19:49.840 align:start position:0%
application process and making sure
 
01:19:52.629 --> 01:19:52.639 align:start position:0%
everything gets put
 
01:19:55.070 --> 01:19:55.080 align:start position:0%
through looking at our inhome support
 
01:19:57.310 --> 01:19:57.320 align:start position:0%
waiver for children and young adults who
 
01:19:59.270 --> 01:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
are still in the school district and
 
01:20:01.110 --> 01:20:01.120 align:start position:0%
accessing services within their family
 
01:20:03.830 --> 01:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
home there were 10 folks who asked
 
01:20:06.390 --> 01:20:06.400 align:start position:0%
accessed um excuse me requested funding
 
01:20:09.590 --> 01:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
and who were funded um of those nine be
 
01:20:12.310 --> 01:20:12.320 align:start position:0%
began their services and one individual
 
01:20:13.950 --> 01:20:13.960 align:start position:0%
did not start Services due to an
 
01:20:15.990 --> 01:20:16.000 align:start position:0%
individual in family
 
01:20:18.310 --> 01:20:18.320 align:start position:0%
request and on our required brain
 
01:20:21.110 --> 01:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
disorder waiver one individual requested
 
01:20:23.709 --> 01:20:23.719 align:start position:0%
Services uh excuse me requested funding
 
01:20:26.390 --> 01:20:26.400 align:start position:0%
and we did fund that individual they
 
01:20:28.790 --> 01:20:28.800 align:start position:0%
were pending their Medicaid benefit to
 
01:20:31.390 --> 01:20:31.400 align:start position:0%
begin so they had not started services
 
01:20:33.350 --> 01:20:33.360 align:start position:0%
within the
 
01:20:37.030 --> 01:20:37.040 align:start position:0%
quarter so as you know we've discussed
 
01:20:39.149 --> 01:20:39.159 align:start position:0%
us really looking at how do we get in
 
01:20:41.950 --> 01:20:41.960 align:start position:0%
there the the top reason really does
 
01:20:44.149 --> 01:20:44.159 align:start position:0%
remain as it's reported both anecdotally
 
01:20:46.110 --> 01:20:46.120 align:start position:0%
from family service coordinators and as
 
01:20:48.310 --> 01:20:48.320 align:start position:0%
our data is starting to show we're
 
01:20:50.830 --> 01:20:50.840 align:start position:0%
continuing to struggle in the area of
 
01:20:53.669 --> 01:20:53.679 align:start position:0%
Workforce so the department has put
 
01:20:55.870 --> 01:20:55.880 align:start position:0%
forward a number of Workforce grants
 
01:20:58.750 --> 01:20:58.760 align:start position:0%
totaling over $155 million as well as
 
01:21:01.270 --> 01:21:01.280 align:start position:0%
over $7 million to service coordinators
 
01:21:03.510 --> 01:21:03.520 align:start position:0%
or case managers in our service delivery
 
01:21:06.189 --> 01:21:06.199 align:start position:0%
system to try to infuse some funding
 
01:21:08.510 --> 01:21:08.520 align:start position:0%
into efforts around um Workforce
 
01:21:09.709 --> 01:21:09.719 align:start position:0%
retention and
 
01:21:12.110 --> 01:21:12.120 align:start position:0%
recruitment um our Service Coordination
 
01:21:14.990 --> 01:21:15.000 align:start position:0%
agencies and the bureau have focused
 
01:21:16.310 --> 01:21:16.320 align:start position:0%
efforts on ensuring service
 
01:21:19.149 --> 01:21:19.159 align:start position:0%
authorizations were in place um this is
 
01:21:21.709 --> 01:21:21.719 align:start position:0%
a reason that in past meetings we have
 
01:21:24.590 --> 01:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
reported was also impacting delay and
 
01:21:26.950 --> 01:21:26.960 align:start position:0%
we're really proud to say that through
 
01:21:28.750 --> 01:21:28.760 align:start position:0%
partnership and work with our area
 
01:21:30.350 --> 01:21:30.360 align:start position:0%
agencies our Service Coordination
 
01:21:32.629 --> 01:21:32.639 align:start position:0%
agencies and the bureau as of the
 
01:21:34.629 --> 01:21:34.639 align:start position:0%
writing of this report only three
 
01:21:38.110 --> 01:21:38.120 align:start position:0%
service authorizations were over 14 days
 
01:21:39.990 --> 01:21:40.000 align:start position:0%
and waiting for the bureau to have an
 
01:21:42.550 --> 01:21:42.560 align:start position:0%
initial review of that so the data is
 
01:21:44.830 --> 01:21:44.840 align:start position:0%
starting to really help both in getting
 
01:21:47.189 --> 01:21:47.199 align:start position:0%
folks access to services but also in our
 
01:21:49.149 --> 01:21:49.159 align:start position:0%
ability to prioritize and organized
 
01:21:51.390 --> 01:21:51.400 align:start position:0%
workload so that we have that view on
 
01:21:53.229 --> 01:21:53.239 align:start position:0%
what's coming in and and make sure that
 
01:21:55.270 --> 01:21:55.280 align:start position:0%
we're getting that work done as quickly
 
01:21:58.229 --> 01:21:58.239 align:start position:0%
as possible on the bureau side as well
 
01:22:00.390 --> 01:22:00.400 align:start position:0%
um we continue to facilitate ongoing
 
01:22:02.189 --> 01:22:02.199 align:start position:0%
meetings with our Service Coordination
 
01:22:05.030 --> 01:22:05.040 align:start position:0%
agencies our provider agencies and now
 
01:22:06.990 --> 01:22:07.000 align:start position:0%
our intake coordinators at our area
 
01:22:09.110 --> 01:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
agencies so that we can all exchange
 
01:22:11.470 --> 01:22:11.480 align:start position:0%
information talk about workflow talk
 
01:22:13.709 --> 01:22:13.719 align:start position:0%
about the data and what enhancements
 
01:22:16.350 --> 01:22:16.360 align:start position:0%
might be needed within the it system it
 
01:22:18.070 --> 01:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
it's been a great process and moving
 
01:22:20.870 --> 01:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
into this data um in this database and
 
01:22:23.270 --> 01:22:23.280 align:start position:0%
as we get data it shows us what we would
 
01:22:25.390 --> 01:22:25.400 align:start position:0%
also like to see different ways to slice
 
01:22:27.950 --> 01:22:27.960 align:start position:0%
and dice and um put those requests in
 
01:22:30.390 --> 01:22:30.400 align:start position:0%
and try to uh find additional
 
01:22:32.470 --> 01:22:32.480 align:start position:0%
opportunity for us to just efficiently
 
01:22:35.470 --> 01:22:35.480 align:start position:0%
View and organize the
 
01:22:38.390 --> 01:22:38.400 align:start position:0%
workload representative representative
 
01:22:42.910 --> 01:22:42.920 align:start position:0%
Edwards uh uh thank you uh I I I think
 
01:22:45.229 --> 01:22:45.239 align:start position:0%
this may be the most spectacular thing
 
01:22:47.709 --> 01:22:47.719 align:start position:0%
I've seen coming out of the state in all
 
01:22:50.830 --> 01:22:50.840 align:start position:0%
of 2024 because we had been asking for
 
01:22:53.590 --> 01:22:53.600 align:start position:0%
the real weight List information for
 
01:22:56.270 --> 01:22:56.280 align:start position:0%
what 3 years now something like that and
 
01:22:59.070 --> 01:22:59.080 align:start position:0%
so you've accomplished something that uh
 
01:23:02.270 --> 01:23:02.280 align:start position:0%
is just wonderful uh to know that and
 
01:23:04.030 --> 01:23:04.040 align:start position:0%
and it isn't just that you've gotten it
 
01:23:06.470 --> 01:23:06.480 align:start position:0%
done it feels like you have pretty
 
01:23:09.070 --> 01:23:09.080 align:start position:0%
strong data confidence that you know the
 
01:23:11.990 --> 01:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
data is real and and that you you've
 
01:23:14.590 --> 01:23:14.600 align:start position:0%
developed a work plan on how to continue
 
01:23:17.590 --> 01:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
to improve it so that's all excellent uh
 
01:23:19.870 --> 01:23:19.880 align:start position:0%
I would just recommend you include a
 
01:23:23.070 --> 01:23:23.080 align:start position:0%
point of contact in the report to to
 
01:23:25.229 --> 01:23:25.239 align:start position:0%
take credit for all the good work and to
 
01:23:27.830 --> 01:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
and to get the occasional uh ad a boy
 
01:23:31.390 --> 01:23:31.400 align:start position:0%
and you know supplemental question but
 
01:23:34.149 --> 01:23:34.159 align:start position:0%
but uh thank thank thank seriously thank
 
01:23:37.350 --> 01:23:37.360 align:start position:0%
you three years of asking for this I
 
01:23:39.669 --> 01:23:39.679 align:start position:0%
would also want to say thank you because
 
01:23:41.830 --> 01:23:41.840 align:start position:0%
earlier in my time in the house I had
 
01:23:44.070 --> 01:23:44.080 align:start position:0%
been quite active working with area a
 
01:23:47.030 --> 01:23:47.040 align:start position:0%
couple of area agencies and so on and
 
01:23:48.110 --> 01:23:48.120 align:start position:0%
there was this
 
01:23:50.990 --> 01:23:51.000 align:start position:0%
frustration uh on the part of individual
 
01:23:52.990 --> 01:23:53.000 align:start position:0%
citizens that they weren't being heard
 
01:23:54.990 --> 01:23:55.000 align:start position:0%
they didn't have a chance I don't hear
 
01:23:56.750 --> 01:23:56.760 align:start position:0%
that much I mean there's always going to
 
01:23:59.270 --> 01:23:59.280 align:start position:0%
be some people who say that but I I find
 
01:24:02.669 --> 01:24:02.679 align:start position:0%
it's in a manageable amount now compared
 
01:24:05.830 --> 01:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
so again thank you and um what's your
 
01:24:07.950 --> 01:24:07.960 align:start position:0%
contact information because it's not in
 
01:24:10.470 --> 01:24:10.480 align:start position:0%
my phone I will bring some business
 
01:24:12.950 --> 01:24:12.960 align:start position:0%
cards up shortly that I can bring some
 
01:24:15.229 --> 01:24:15.239 align:start position:0%
business cards up short great yeah I
 
01:24:17.990 --> 01:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
love cards thank you any other questions
 
01:24:20.950 --> 01:24:20.960 align:start position:0%
yes representative Weber so now that we
 
01:24:24.629 --> 01:24:24.639 align:start position:0%
have all this great data and I I add my
 
01:24:27.750 --> 01:24:27.760 align:start position:0%
thanks to everybody else's I'm wondering
 
01:24:31.070 --> 01:24:31.080 align:start position:0%
if um you could elaborate a little bit
 
01:24:34.750 --> 01:24:34.760 align:start position:0%
on the no current Medicaid open category
 
01:24:36.629 --> 01:24:36.639 align:start position:0%
because that seems to be one of the
 
01:24:39.950 --> 01:24:39.960 align:start position:0%
roadblocks and is that a matter of
 
01:24:43.070 --> 01:24:43.080 align:start position:0%
people needing help to finish the
 
01:24:46.270 --> 01:24:46.280 align:start position:0%
application process uh or is is are
 
01:24:47.590 --> 01:24:47.600 align:start position:0%
there things that you see that we could
 
01:24:51.070 --> 01:24:51.080 align:start position:0%
be doing to facilitate getting that
 
01:24:53.070 --> 01:24:53.080 align:start position:0%
category down cuz I understand the other
 
01:24:55.149 --> 01:24:55.159 align:start position:0%
ones sometime if the people aren't there
 
01:24:57.870 --> 01:24:57.880 align:start position:0%
they're aren't there but yeah it it
 
01:24:59.790 --> 01:24:59.800 align:start position:0%
could be for a number of reasons um
 
01:25:03.229 --> 01:25:03.239 align:start position:0%
folks sometimes will um apply and maybe
 
01:25:06.070 --> 01:25:06.080 align:start position:0%
not offer the the verifications or the
 
01:25:08.109 --> 01:25:08.119 align:start position:0%
documents that the Medicaid office needs
 
01:25:10.229 --> 01:25:10.239 align:start position:0%
to determine if that individual might be
 
01:25:12.550 --> 01:25:12.560 align:start position:0%
eligible particularly around the look
 
01:25:14.070 --> 01:25:14.080 align:start position:0%
back requirement if folks have heard
 
01:25:15.830 --> 01:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
that terminology and looking at those
 
01:25:18.830 --> 01:25:18.840 align:start position:0%
assets over the last several years um in
 
01:25:21.430 --> 01:25:21.440 align:start position:0%
some cases you know folks maybe need
 
01:25:23.229 --> 01:25:23.239 align:start position:0%
some support in filing those
 
01:25:25.430 --> 01:25:25.440 align:start position:0%
applications and we've been able to
 
01:25:27.229 --> 01:25:27.239 align:start position:0%
create really strong collaboration and
 
01:25:28.870 --> 01:25:28.880 align:start position:0%
partnership with our Bureau of family
 
01:25:30.709 --> 01:25:30.719 align:start position:0%
assistance and also with the service
 
01:25:32.430 --> 01:25:32.440 align:start position:0%
link aging and disability Resource
 
01:25:34.510 --> 01:25:34.520 align:start position:0%
Centers um overseen by my colleague
 
01:25:36.990 --> 01:25:37.000 align:start position:0%
Wendy and making sure that folks have
 
01:25:38.950 --> 01:25:38.960 align:start position:0%
access to those supports too if they
 
01:25:41.310 --> 01:25:41.320 align:start position:0%
need just a little extra you know some
 
01:25:42.790 --> 01:25:42.800 align:start position:0%
arms wrapped around them and the
 
01:25:44.510 --> 01:25:44.520 align:start position:0%
application process to help them
 
01:25:47.229 --> 01:25:47.239 align:start position:0%
navigate that and what can often be a
 
01:25:50.229 --> 01:25:50.239 align:start position:0%
very trying point in time in their life
 
01:25:52.189 --> 01:25:52.199 align:start position:0%
so we understand more supports are
 
01:25:54.430 --> 01:25:54.440 align:start position:0%
needed those are typically the reasons
 
01:25:56.510 --> 01:25:56.520 align:start position:0%
we see that delay thank you you're
 
01:25:59.149 --> 01:25:59.159 align:start position:0%
welcome thank you very much for that any
 
01:26:01.350 --> 01:26:01.360 align:start position:0%
further questions thank you M Gordon

care
 
01:26:09.550 --> 01:26:09.560 align:start position:0%
now a report update regarding the use of
 
01:26:11.550 --> 01:26:11.560 align:start position:0%
restraint and the use of different modes
 
01:26:13.310 --> 01:26:13.320 align:start position:0%
of transportation of patients to New
 
01:26:16.229 --> 01:26:16.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital or other designated
 
01:26:18.990 --> 01:26:19.000 align:start position:0%
receiving facilities and in the matter
 
01:26:21.669 --> 01:26:21.679 align:start position:0%

01:27:33.189 --> 01:27:33.199 align:start position:0%
from the emergency room which they are
 
01:27:35.629 --> 01:27:35.639 align:start position:0%
seen to either New Hampshire hospital or
 
01:27:37.750 --> 01:27:37.760 align:start position:0%
one of the other six designated
 
01:27:38.950 --> 01:27:38.960 align:start position:0%
receiving facilities throughout the
 
01:27:40.790 --> 01:27:40.800 align:start position:0%
state there they will get the
 
01:27:42.750 --> 01:27:42.760 align:start position:0%
appropriate inpatient psychiatric
 
01:27:45.550 --> 01:27:45.560 align:start position:0%
treatment that they need historically
 
01:27:48.189 --> 01:27:48.199 align:start position:0%
before 2020 all these transports were
 
01:27:51.550 --> 01:27:51.560 align:start position:0%
done by law enforcement but Senate Bill
 
01:27:55.189 --> 01:27:55.199 align:start position:0%
177 gave the explicit option of using an
 
01:27:57.550 --> 01:27:57.560 align:start position:0%
ambulance in addition to the option of
 
01:27:59.709 --> 01:27:59.719 align:start position:0%
law enforcement and the idea there was
 
01:28:01.950 --> 01:28:01.960 align:start position:0%
to reduce the use of restraints in these
 
01:28:04.070 --> 01:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
transports and the associated trauma
 
01:28:06.629 --> 01:28:06.639 align:start position:0%
with that um while keeping the safety of
 
01:28:09.629 --> 01:28:09.639 align:start position:0%
everyone involved at top of
 
01:28:13.870 --> 01:28:13.880 align:start position:0%
mind so now a provider um who designates
 
01:28:16.350 --> 01:28:16.360 align:start position:0%
an IA gets to choose whether law
 
01:28:19.750 --> 01:28:19.760 align:start position:0%
enforcement or ambulance is appropriate
 
01:28:22.149 --> 01:28:22.159 align:start position:0%
and then the uh transport agency
 
01:28:24.550 --> 01:28:24.560 align:start position:0%
themselves ultimately gets to decide if
 
01:28:27.430 --> 01:28:27.440 align:start position:0%
restraint usage is appropriate in that
 
01:28:30.189 --> 01:28:30.199 align:start position:0%
case so this is now the fifth report
 
01:28:33.310 --> 01:28:33.320 align:start position:0%
that we are presenting to this uh
 
01:28:37.750 --> 01:28:37.760 align:start position:0%
committee um all the law also said that
 
01:28:40.149 --> 01:28:40.159 align:start position:0%
all the drfs had to report on a yearly
 
01:28:42.550 --> 01:28:42.560 align:start position:0%
basis their data to this committee that
 
01:28:44.790 --> 01:28:44.800 align:start position:0%
included the number of transports broken
 
01:28:47.709 --> 01:28:47.719 align:start position:0%
down by age type of transport and
 
01:28:47.719 --> 01:28:49.350 align:start position:0%
down by age type of transport and
restraint

01:28:49.350 --> 01:28:49.360 align:start position:0%
restraint
 
01:28:52.430 --> 01:28:52.440 align:start position:0%
usage uh none of the drfs reported Data
 
01:28:54.870 --> 01:28:54.880 align:start position:0%
before 2020 so we have anything to
 
01:28:58.109 --> 01:28:58.119 align:start position:0%
compare to before the law went into
 
01:29:01.310 --> 01:29:01.320 align:start position:0%
effect so this like I said this is the
 
01:29:03.870 --> 01:29:03.880 align:start position:0%
year five report and this represents
 
01:29:07.070 --> 01:29:07.080 align:start position:0%
September or October 2023 excuse me to
 
01:29:07.080 --> 01:29:08.470 align:start position:0%
September or October 2023 excuse me to
September

01:29:08.470 --> 01:29:08.480 align:start position:0%
September
 
01:29:11.790 --> 01:29:11.800 align:start position:0%
2024 um the top of page one you can see
 
01:29:13.709 --> 01:29:13.719 align:start position:0%
there is a bit more background
 
01:29:16.550 --> 01:29:16.560 align:start position:0%
information on the law as well as a
 
01:29:18.830 --> 01:29:18.840 align:start position:0%
stakeholder group that came together uh
 
01:29:21.430 --> 01:29:21.440 align:start position:0%
to give input to this process at the
 
01:29:23.070 --> 01:29:23.080 align:start position:0%
bottom we see some summary statistics
 
01:29:25.109 --> 01:29:25.119 align:start position:0%
for the year so we had
 
01:29:29.229 --> 01:29:29.239 align:start position:0%
1251 ieas that's an average of 104 per
 
01:29:32.270 --> 01:29:32.280 align:start position:0%
month 99% were adults there were only
 
01:29:36.149 --> 01:29:36.159 align:start position:0%
four child transports for this year 40%
 
01:29:39.310 --> 01:29:39.320 align:start position:0%
of transports went by ambulance 59% by
 
01:29:41.669 --> 01:29:41.679 align:start position:0%
law enforcement and the remaining few is
 
01:29:43.629 --> 01:29:43.639 align:start position:0%
in other category and that's almost
 
01:29:46.669 --> 01:29:46.679 align:start position:0%
always a family member or facility staff
 
01:29:49.709 --> 01:29:49.719 align:start position:0%
member transporting the patient a little
 
01:29:51.709 --> 01:29:51.719 align:start position:0%
less than half of transports occurred
 
01:29:54.030 --> 01:29:54.040 align:start position:0%
without restraints there are a handful
 
01:29:57.870 --> 01:29:57.880 align:start position:0%
full of unknowns um and the breakdown of
 
01:30:00.390 --> 01:30:00.400 align:start position:0%
type of restraints used the majority
 
01:30:04.189 --> 01:30:04.199 align:start position:0%
were either waist belt or a
 
01:30:07.109 --> 01:30:07.119 align:start position:0%
combination top of page two you can see
 
01:30:11.310 --> 01:30:11.320 align:start position:0%
all the transports uh broken down by drf
 
01:30:13.990 --> 01:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
and by month just to give you a sense of
 
01:30:16.870 --> 01:30:16.880 align:start position:0%
volume the following sections give a
 
01:30:19.390 --> 01:30:19.400 align:start position:0%
summary on the mode of transportation
 
01:30:22.310 --> 01:30:22.320 align:start position:0%
restraints used um usage and the type of
 
01:30:23.629 --> 01:30:23.639 align:start position:0%
restraints used but you can see more
 
01:30:26.590 --> 01:30:26.600 align:start position:0%
detail in the appendix if you are
 
01:30:29.709 --> 01:30:29.719 align:start position:0%
interested so for motive transportation
 
01:30:32.750 --> 01:30:32.760 align:start position:0%
again since 99% were uh adults and this
 
01:30:35.350 --> 01:30:35.360 align:start position:0%
is for adults only we're seeing the same
 
01:30:39.189 --> 01:30:39.199 align:start position:0%
breakdown of 40% ambulance and roughly
 
01:30:41.550 --> 01:30:41.560 align:start position:0%
60% law enforcement but there is some
 
01:30:43.470 --> 01:30:43.480 align:start position:0%
variation from month to month throughout
 
01:30:43.480 --> 01:30:44.350 align:start position:0%
variation from month to month throughout
the

01:30:44.350 --> 01:30:44.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:30:47.669 --> 01:30:47.679 align:start position:0%
year uh restraint application really
 
01:30:51.669 --> 01:30:51.679 align:start position:0%
depends heavily on the type of uh motor
 
01:30:54.790 --> 01:30:54.800 align:start position:0%
Transportation you're in so 86% of law
 
01:30:57.830 --> 01:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
enforcement transports used restraints
 
01:30:59.830 --> 01:30:59.840 align:start position:0%
were compared to ambulance there were
 
01:31:02.590 --> 01:31:02.600 align:start position:0%
only two cases of restraints used
 
01:31:04.430 --> 01:31:04.440 align:start position:0%
throughout the entire
 
01:31:08.350 --> 01:31:08.360 align:start position:0%
year and on page four you see the
 
01:31:10.550 --> 01:31:10.560 align:start position:0%
visualization of the types of restraints
 
01:31:14.990 --> 01:31:15.000 align:start position:0%
used um again no one is overwhelmingly
 
01:31:17.310 --> 01:31:17.320 align:start position:0%
used but the waist belt and the
 
01:31:20.669 --> 01:31:20.679 align:start position:0%
combination were the most heavily um
 
01:31:23.310 --> 01:31:23.320 align:start position:0%
favored for child transports again there
 
01:31:25.470 --> 01:31:25.480 align:start position:0%
were only four four the whole year three
 
01:31:28.669 --> 01:31:28.679 align:start position:0%
by ambulance one by law enforcement with
 
01:31:32.510 --> 01:31:32.520 align:start position:0%
no restraints used in any of the
 
01:31:35.750 --> 01:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
cases on page five uh and six have
 
01:31:38.629 --> 01:31:38.639 align:start position:0%
provided some trending data for you to
 
01:31:41.590 --> 01:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
see um how different metrics have
 
01:31:43.669 --> 01:31:43.679 align:start position:0%
progressed over the Year we're over the
 
01:31:46.030 --> 01:31:46.040 align:start position:0%
years we're really not seeing a lot of
 
01:31:48.390 --> 01:31:48.400 align:start position:0%
variation we did see a slight increase
 
01:31:50.950 --> 01:31:50.960 align:start position:0%
in the number of transports in year five
 
01:31:53.030 --> 01:31:53.040 align:start position:0%
partly due to the fact all New Hampshire
 
01:31:55.070 --> 01:31:55.080 align:start position:0%
hospitals hard work they were able to
 
01:31:57.590 --> 01:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
open the 12 additional beds back in
 
01:32:01.550 --> 01:32:01.560 align:start position:0%
April of this year okay and the last
 
01:32:04.550 --> 01:32:04.560 align:start position:0%
page um again a couple visualizations
 
01:32:07.830 --> 01:32:07.840 align:start position:0%
just to show you the trends uh over the
 
01:32:11.790 --> 01:32:11.800 align:start position:0%
year of all ieas by month and then
 
01:32:14.990 --> 01:32:15.000 align:start position:0%
restraint usage between ambulance and
 
01:32:17.149 --> 01:32:17.159 align:start position:0%
law enforcement transports over the 5
 
01:32:19.790 --> 01:32:19.800 align:start position:0%
years as well and then the appendix
 
01:32:22.470 --> 01:32:22.480 align:start position:0%
follows that so I no just thre a lot of
 
01:32:25.709 --> 01:32:25.719 align:start position:0%
numbers at you to take any questions on
 
01:32:25.719 --> 01:32:28.990 align:start position:0%
numbers at you to take any questions on
this

01:32:28.990 --> 01:32:29.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:31.870 --> 01:32:31.880 align:start position:0%
data representative Edwards thank you Mr
 
01:32:35.310 --> 01:32:35.320 align:start position:0%
chair uh really nice report I I on page
 
01:32:39.109 --> 01:32:39.119 align:start position:0%
three um in the second line it says that
 
01:32:41.830 --> 01:32:41.840 align:start position:0%
the uh restraint application that that's
 
01:32:43.830 --> 01:32:43.840 align:start position:0%
going to tell this report will tell us
 
01:32:46.030 --> 01:32:46.040 align:start position:0%
whether the application was before or
 
01:32:48.510 --> 01:32:48.520 align:start position:0%
during transfer and then when I look at
 
01:32:51.870 --> 01:32:51.880 align:start position:0%
the key I I can see the before transport
 
01:32:54.750 --> 01:32:54.760 align:start position:0%
but not sort of the dur during transport
 
01:32:57.709 --> 01:32:57.719 align:start position:0%
I see start only I I I don't know if
 
01:33:00.430 --> 01:33:00.440 align:start position:0%
that's meant to be the indicator for
 
01:33:03.669 --> 01:33:03.679 align:start position:0%
restraints added during trans transport
 
01:33:04.990 --> 01:33:05.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question yes let me
 
01:33:07.870 --> 01:33:07.880 align:start position:0%
clarify so before transport that's the
 
01:33:09.910 --> 01:33:09.920 align:start position:0%
vast majority that means restraints were
 
01:33:12.030 --> 01:33:12.040 align:start position:0%
applied to the patient before and then
 
01:33:14.350 --> 01:33:14.360 align:start position:0%
Remain the whole time um there was one
 
01:33:15.790 --> 01:33:15.800 align:start position:0%
case of restraints applied at the
 
01:33:17.510 --> 01:33:17.520 align:start position:0%
beginning and then apparently removed
 
01:33:19.750 --> 01:33:19.760 align:start position:0%
during transport which is an option that
 
01:33:21.870 --> 01:33:21.880 align:start position:0%
they had that was what was reported to
 
01:33:24.629 --> 01:33:24.639 align:start position:0%
me right I'm just I'm yes please I'm
 
01:33:26.990 --> 01:33:27.000 align:start position:0%
just pointing out uh that the narrative
 
01:33:30.390 --> 01:33:30.400 align:start position:0%
says or during transfer and there's no
 
01:33:34.109 --> 01:33:34.119 align:start position:0%
legend that tells us if if it was done
 
01:33:37.590 --> 01:33:37.600 align:start position:0%
during transport I there's a there's a
 
01:33:39.510 --> 01:33:39.520 align:start position:0%
conflict between the words and the
 
01:33:42.189 --> 01:33:42.199 align:start position:0%
legend is what I'm trying to say than
 
01:33:45.470 --> 01:33:45.480 align:start position:0%
inartfully and then follow up follow up
 
01:33:47.750 --> 01:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
and then I'm looking at the the graph on
 
01:33:50.590 --> 01:33:50.600 align:start position:0%
page six bottom right yep uh it looks
 
01:33:54.709 --> 01:33:54.719 align:start position:0%
like uh this data is from 2020
 
01:33:58.750 --> 01:33:58.760 align:start position:0%
2024 and as I look at the relationship
 
01:34:01.470 --> 01:34:01.480 align:start position:0%
between restraint used and transport yes
 
01:34:05.750 --> 01:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
or no it it feels at first glance that
 
01:34:09.910 --> 01:34:09.920 align:start position:0%
it's a conflict with the data on page
 
01:34:12.350 --> 01:34:12.360 align:start position:0%
three because page three seems to
 
01:34:14.550 --> 01:34:14.560 align:start position:0%
indicate that we have a tremendous
 
01:34:17.189 --> 01:34:17.199 align:start position:0%
amount of no restraint when you count
 
01:34:17.199 --> 01:34:18.510 align:start position:0%
amount of no restraint when you count
the

01:34:18.510 --> 01:34:18.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:34:21.750 --> 01:34:21.760 align:start position:0%
ambulances and that this chart doesn't
 
01:34:25.910 --> 01:34:25.920 align:start position:0%
seem to reflect the ambulance lack of
 
01:34:28.629 --> 01:34:28.639 align:start position:0%
restraint right so on the left on the
 
01:34:30.669 --> 01:34:30.679 align:start position:0%
bottom of page six is the ambulance so
 
01:34:34.189 --> 01:34:34.199 align:start position:0%
it's showing almost 100 100% oh okay
 
01:34:36.750 --> 01:34:36.760 align:start position:0%
that's my fault I I was looking for a
 
01:34:39.830 --> 01:34:39.840 align:start position:0%
blended um graph and and you didn't put
 
01:34:42.470 --> 01:34:42.480 align:start position:0%
one there so thank you for the
 
01:34:45.109 --> 01:34:45.119 align:start position:0%
clarification you're welcome thank you
 
01:34:46.629 --> 01:34:46.639 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant I'll make it
 
01:34:49.470 --> 01:34:49.480 align:start position:0%
quick thank you Mr chair in regards to
 
01:34:51.310 --> 01:34:51.320 align:start position:0%
the discrepancy or or the variance you
 
01:34:52.990 --> 01:34:53.000 align:start position:0%
should say between law enforcement
 
01:34:55.390 --> 01:34:55.400 align:start position:0%
restraints of the ambulance can you
 
01:34:57.750 --> 01:34:57.760 align:start position:0%
speak to what is driving that is it
 
01:34:59.149 --> 01:34:59.159 align:start position:0%
because of the nature of the person
 
01:35:02.270 --> 01:35:02.280 align:start position:0%
being transported it's because of the
 
01:35:05.149 --> 01:35:05.159 align:start position:0%
philosophical or the the way somebody
 
01:35:07.350 --> 01:35:07.360 align:start position:0%
approaches transportation in other words
 
01:35:09.189 --> 01:35:09.199 align:start position:0%
it's law enforcement more likely to use
 
01:35:10.990 --> 01:35:11.000 align:start position:0%
restraints because it's kind of the way
 
01:35:13.790 --> 01:35:13.800 align:start position:0%
their DNA is structured or is it more
 
01:35:15.669 --> 01:35:15.679 align:start position:0%
because of the way the person who's
 
01:35:17.109 --> 01:35:17.119 align:start position:0%
inside of the law enforcement
 
01:35:19.430 --> 01:35:19.440 align:start position:0%
transportation is requiring it trying to
 
01:35:20.870 --> 01:35:20.880 align:start position:0%
understand which is driving
 
01:35:23.350 --> 01:35:23.360 align:start position:0%
it I can't speak with certainty on
 
01:35:25.270 --> 01:35:25.280 align:start position:0%
what's driving it but as a clinician and
 
01:35:26.629 --> 01:35:26.639 align:start position:0%
and someone who works at New Hampshire
 
01:35:29.350 --> 01:35:29.360 align:start position:0%
hospital um the emergency rooms decide
 
01:35:30.189 --> 01:35:30.199 align:start position:0%
whether they're going to call an
 
01:35:32.629 --> 01:35:32.639 align:start position:0%
ambulance or um the sheriff's department
 
01:35:37.510 --> 01:35:37.520 align:start position:0%
and clinicians are going to um lean into
 
01:35:40.430 --> 01:35:40.440 align:start position:0%
calling law enforcement for more acute
 
01:35:43.030 --> 01:35:43.040 align:start position:0%
and potentially violent person to begin
 
01:35:45.709 --> 01:35:45.719 align:start position:0%
with um and so I mean there could be
 
01:35:48.629 --> 01:35:48.639 align:start position:0%
also some bias in law enforcement to
 
01:35:50.870 --> 01:35:50.880 align:start position:0%
tend to want to always use restraints
 
01:35:53.669 --> 01:35:53.679 align:start position:0%
but it's already skewed by the fact that
 
01:35:55.229 --> 01:35:55.239 align:start position:0%
the emergency room has decided that
 
01:35:56.790 --> 01:35:56.800 align:start position:0%
they're not calling an ambulance because
 
01:35:58.510 --> 01:35:58.520 align:start position:0%
this person's too potentially violent
 
01:36:01.310 --> 01:36:01.320 align:start position:0%
for an ambulance thank you
 
01:36:04.470 --> 01:36:04.480 align:start position:0%
representative Weber and just as a
 
01:36:06.350 --> 01:36:06.360 align:start position:0%
comment when when we drafted the
 
01:36:08.709 --> 01:36:08.719 align:start position:0%
legislation that was the subject of a
 
01:36:12.629 --> 01:36:12.639 align:start position:0%
significant amount of uh discussion and
 
01:36:16.030 --> 01:36:16.040 align:start position:0%
compromise and listening to everybody so
 
01:36:18.149 --> 01:36:18.159 align:start position:0%
we felt that the clinician at the
 
01:36:23.229 --> 01:36:23.239 align:start position:0%
emergency room was in the best place to
 
01:36:23.239 --> 01:36:24.229 align:start position:0%
emergency room was in the best place to
assess

01:36:24.229 --> 01:36:24.239 align:start position:0%
assess
 
01:36:26.910 --> 01:36:26.920 align:start position:0%
what would be in the best in their
 
01:36:30.430 --> 01:36:30.440 align:start position:0%
clinical opinion in the best interest of
 
01:36:31.790 --> 01:36:31.800 align:start position:0%
the person being
 
01:36:34.590 --> 01:36:34.600 align:start position:0%
transported but the folks doing the
 
01:36:39.070 --> 01:36:39.080 align:start position:0%
transporting got to decide on the level
 
01:36:41.430 --> 01:36:41.440 align:start position:0%
that they felt comfortable with for both
 
01:36:43.229 --> 01:36:43.239 align:start position:0%
the safety of the patient and the safety
 
01:36:46.590 --> 01:36:46.600 align:start position:0%
of their personnel which was a of great
 
01:36:49.070 --> 01:36:49.080 align:start position:0%
concern to everybody so that that's kind
 
01:36:52.189 --> 01:36:52.199 align:start position:0%
of the way the decisionmaking tree came
 
01:36:55.270 --> 01:36:55.280 align:start position:0%
out and obviously I think the clinical
 
01:36:58.030 --> 01:36:58.040 align:start position:0%
decision at the at the emergency room
 
01:37:02.030 --> 01:37:02.040 align:start position:0%
level would drive some of the
 
01:37:03.950 --> 01:37:03.960 align:start position:0%
assumptions about what was needed in
 
01:37:07.189 --> 01:37:07.199 align:start position:0%
terms of restraint for for uh
 
01:37:10.430 --> 01:37:10.440 align:start position:0%
transport representative
 
01:37:14.390 --> 01:37:14.400 align:start position:0%
McDonald thank you Mr chairman um so in
 
01:37:16.870 --> 01:37:16.880 align:start position:0%
terms of designated receiving facilities
 
01:37:19.030 --> 01:37:19.040 align:start position:0%
in the state there's seven of them is
 
01:37:19.040 --> 01:37:20.270 align:start position:0%
in the state there's seven of them is
that

01:37:20.270 --> 01:37:20.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:37:23.790 --> 01:37:23.800 align:start position:0%
correct um followup followup yeah uh
 
01:37:26.229 --> 01:37:26.239 align:start position:0%
cypress center where is that located
 
01:37:29.910 --> 01:37:29.920 align:start position:0%
yeah Manchester Manchester okay and
 
01:37:32.550 --> 01:37:32.560 align:start position:0%
another followup Mr followup um so it
 
01:37:34.709 --> 01:37:34.719 align:start position:0%
seems like and and understandably this
 
01:37:36.950 --> 01:37:36.960 align:start position:0%
is pretty much the population centers of
 
01:37:38.790 --> 01:37:38.800 align:start position:0%
the state but the western side of the
 
01:37:41.470 --> 01:37:41.480 align:start position:0%
state the nor more northern areas uh
 
01:37:42.910 --> 01:37:42.920 align:start position:0%
what happens up there they have to be
 
01:37:44.510 --> 01:37:44.520 align:start position:0%
transported to Franklin or something
 
01:37:45.669 --> 01:37:45.679 align:start position:0%
like that or
 
01:37:49.950 --> 01:37:49.960 align:start position:0%
to um I'm not but they'll they'll be so
 
01:37:52.709 --> 01:37:52.719 align:start position:0%
the way that um the care traffic control
 
01:37:54.750 --> 01:37:54.760 align:start position:0%
team works now at New Hampshire hospital
 
01:37:56.669 --> 01:37:56.679 align:start position:0%
we receive all the IIA referrals and we
 
01:37:59.070 --> 01:37:59.080 align:start position:0%
make referrals out to what we feel would
 
01:38:03.109 --> 01:38:03.119 align:start position:0%
be the most appropriate drf and we do
 
01:38:05.430 --> 01:38:05.440 align:start position:0%
take into consideration how close that
 
01:38:08.030 --> 01:38:08.040 align:start position:0%
drf is to that patient's home and to
 
01:38:10.270 --> 01:38:10.280 align:start position:0%
your point there are fewer available
 
01:38:14.149 --> 01:38:14.159 align:start position:0%
drfs in the North Country um and so you
 
01:38:15.470 --> 01:38:15.480 align:start position:0%
know and we also have to take into
 
01:38:16.870 --> 01:38:16.880 align:start position:0%
consideration the weight for any
 
01:38:18.390 --> 01:38:18.400 align:start position:0%
particular bed I we don't want someone
 
01:38:19.950 --> 01:38:19.960 align:start position:0%
waiting in the emergency room longer
 
01:38:21.950 --> 01:38:21.960 align:start position:0%
than necessary and so we want to move
 
01:38:24.070 --> 01:38:24.080 align:start position:0%
them to a drf bed as soon as possible
 
01:38:26.830 --> 01:38:26.840 align:start position:0%
but um yeah there are some part areas
 
01:38:28.510 --> 01:38:28.520 align:start position:0%
geographically in the state that don't
 
01:38:31.589 --> 01:38:31.599 align:start position:0%
have as many drf beds available one more
 
01:38:34.030 --> 01:38:34.040 align:start position:0%
followup yes followup are there thoughts
 
01:38:36.030 --> 01:38:36.040 align:start position:0%
about perhaps developing anything in the
 
01:38:38.350 --> 01:38:38.360 align:start position:0%
more Western areas or northern areas or
 
01:38:41.109 --> 01:38:41.119 align:start position:0%
is that that maybe down the road the
 
01:38:43.390 --> 01:38:43.400 align:start position:0%
state's always open to other facilities
 
01:38:46.709 --> 01:38:46.719 align:start position:0%
who want to apply for certification as a
 
01:38:50.629 --> 01:38:50.639 align:start position:0%
drf thank you and just to add to that um
 
01:38:53.790 --> 01:38:53.800 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth is opening for Dr is there
 
01:38:55.109 --> 01:38:55.119 align:start position:0%
four drf
 
01:38:58.350 --> 01:38:58.360 align:start position:0%
beds five thank you five drf beds um in
 
01:39:01.109 --> 01:39:01.119 align:start position:0%
the next couple of months Marissa so
 
01:39:02.589 --> 01:39:02.599 align:start position:0%
yeah so at least we'll have a few more
 
01:39:05.149 --> 01:39:05.159 align:start position:0%
in the Dartmouth area thank you
 
01:39:07.790 --> 01:39:07.800 align:start position:0%
representative Weber I will just say
 
01:39:10.629 --> 01:39:10.639 align:start position:0%
that it is um a matter of some grief to
 
01:39:13.390 --> 01:39:13.400 align:start position:0%
me but uh Cheshire Medical Center had an
 
01:39:15.870 --> 01:39:15.880 align:start position:0%
8-bed psychiatric unit and when our
 
01:39:20.229 --> 01:39:20.239 align:start position:0%
psychiatrist retired we were unable my
 
01:39:21.629 --> 01:39:21.639 align:start position:0%
understanding is that the hospital was
 
01:39:25.030 --> 01:39:25.040 align:start position:0%
unable to find another individual to
 
01:39:28.669 --> 01:39:28.679 align:start position:0%
take on the job of supervising that unit
 
01:39:30.870 --> 01:39:30.880 align:start position:0%
and the unit has now obviously been
 
01:39:34.430 --> 01:39:34.440 align:start position:0%
repurposed to something else and it's um
 
01:39:37.790 --> 01:39:37.800 align:start position:0%
it's a real loss to the to the um
 
01:39:40.750 --> 01:39:40.760 align:start position:0%
Southwestern portion of the state but
 
01:39:44.790 --> 01:39:44.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:47.189 --> 01:39:47.199 align:start position:0%
is no further questions have anything
 
01:39:57.229 --> 01:39:57.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:59.790 --> 01:39:59.800 align:start position:0%

commission so I thought I would
 
01:41:00.599 --> 01:41:02.709 align:start position:0%
commission so I thought I would
start

01:41:02.709 --> 01:41:02.719 align:start position:0%
start
 
01:41:07.109 --> 01:41:07.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:09.550 --> 01:41:09.560 align:start position:0%
report and start with a little bit of a
 
01:41:11.709 --> 01:41:11.719 align:start position:0%
brief history on the commission so the
 
01:41:12.990 --> 01:41:13.000 align:start position:0%
commission was established during the
 
01:41:16.189 --> 01:41:16.199 align:start position:0%
2019 legislative session the key charge
 
01:41:17.709 --> 01:41:17.719 align:start position:0%
for the commission is to advise the
 
01:41:19.709 --> 01:41:19.719 align:start position:0%
governor and legislature on policy and
 
01:41:22.470 --> 01:41:22.480 align:start position:0%
planning related to aging we study areas
 
01:41:24.470 --> 01:41:24.480 align:start position:0%
of public policy
 
01:41:26.350 --> 01:41:26.360 align:start position:0%
and that impact older adults and
 
01:41:28.070 --> 01:41:28.080 align:start position:0%
annually produce a report on our
 
01:41:29.550 --> 01:41:29.560 align:start position:0%
findings that includes recommendations
 
01:41:32.390 --> 01:41:32.400 align:start position:0%
for change the report is just one way in
 
01:41:34.950 --> 01:41:34.960 align:start position:0%
which we carry out our charge we also
 
01:41:36.629 --> 01:41:36.639 align:start position:0%
have a fabulous newsletter that is
 
01:41:39.430 --> 01:41:39.440 align:start position:0%
edited by a volunteer that uh comes into
 
01:41:41.750 --> 01:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
your inboxes um every month it also goes
 
01:41:44.030 --> 01:41:44.040 align:start position:0%
out to many New Hampshire citizens who
 
01:41:45.589 --> 01:41:45.599 align:start position:0%
find it of
 
01:41:48.870 --> 01:41:48.880 align:start position:0%
value and um so in a in a brief time I'm
 
01:41:49.950 --> 01:41:49.960 align:start position:0%
going to give an overview of the
 
01:41:52.030 --> 01:41:52.040 align:start position:0%
organization of the annual report
 
01:41:53.589 --> 01:41:53.599 align:start position:0%
priority recommendations for the
 
01:41:55.750 --> 01:41:55.760 align:start position:0%
upcoming session and areas where
 
01:41:57.430 --> 01:41:57.440 align:start position:0%
discussions by policy makers such as
 
01:42:00.270 --> 01:42:00.280 align:start position:0%
yourselves uh are needed to develop
 
01:42:02.189 --> 01:42:02.199 align:start position:0%
consensus so if you'd like to follow
 
01:42:05.229 --> 01:42:05.239 align:start position:0%
along with me on page three um is a
 
01:42:06.790 --> 01:42:06.800 align:start position:0%
message for myself and the outgoing
 
01:42:09.390 --> 01:42:09.400 align:start position:0%
chair of the commission zuka the key
 
01:42:11.310 --> 01:42:11.320 align:start position:0%
message that's in there is that New
 
01:42:13.709 --> 01:42:13.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire right now is experiencing a
 
01:42:15.790 --> 01:42:15.800 align:start position:0%
significant demographic shift whereby
 
01:42:18.030 --> 01:42:18.040 align:start position:0%
our communities are increasingly compre
 
01:42:20.550 --> 01:42:20.560 align:start position:0%
comprised of more older adults and fewer
 
01:42:23.229 --> 01:42:23.239 align:start position:0%
younger people the shift is not only
 
01:42:25.629 --> 01:42:25.639 align:start position:0%
happening fast but it is a permanent
 
01:42:27.990 --> 01:42:28.000 align:start position:0%
change to the makeup of our communities
 
01:42:30.830 --> 01:42:30.840 align:start position:0%
it's not just baby boomers aging it is
 
01:42:32.709 --> 01:42:32.719 align:start position:0%
driven by declining birth rates and
 
01:42:35.390 --> 01:42:35.400 align:start position:0%
people living longer lives and it's a
 
01:42:37.629 --> 01:42:37.639 align:start position:0%
trend that's not going away so it's time
 
01:42:40.470 --> 01:42:40.480 align:start position:0%
for um New Hampshire's older for all of
 
01:42:41.830 --> 01:42:41.840 align:start position:0%
us to start seeing New Hampshire's older
 
01:42:43.950 --> 01:42:43.960 align:start position:0%
adults as a as a valuable natural
 
01:42:46.669 --> 01:42:46.679 align:start position:0%
resource our state has we can amplify
 
01:42:48.430 --> 01:42:48.440 align:start position:0%
the opportunity through reforming our
 
01:42:52.189 --> 01:42:52.199 align:start position:0%
systems of care employment models e um
 
01:42:54.229 --> 01:42:54.239 align:start position:0%
housing and transport ation options and
 
01:42:55.870 --> 01:42:55.880 align:start position:0%
harnessing the economic engine and
 
01:42:58.550 --> 01:42:58.560 align:start position:0%
talents of our in increasingly capable
 
01:42:58.560 --> 01:42:59.629 align:start position:0%
talents of our in increasingly capable
older

01:42:59.629 --> 01:42:59.639 align:start position:0%
older
 
01:43:02.589 --> 01:43:02.599 align:start position:0%
residents so page five uh includes the
 
01:43:03.910 --> 01:43:03.920 align:start position:0%
vision mission and values of the
 
01:43:05.310 --> 01:43:05.320 align:start position:0%
commission and list the commission
 
01:43:08.030 --> 01:43:08.040 align:start position:0%
members who were um at who were on the
 
01:43:09.030 --> 01:43:09.040 align:start position:0%
people on the Comm who were on the
 
01:43:10.270 --> 01:43:10.280 align:start position:0%
commission at the time this vote was
 
01:43:14.350 --> 01:43:14.360 align:start position:0%
reported upon um page six highlights the
 
01:43:15.830 --> 01:43:15.840 align:start position:0%
activities of the Commission on Aging
 
01:43:18.149 --> 01:43:18.159 align:start position:0%
over the past year and Page seven Begins
 
01:43:20.229 --> 01:43:20.239 align:start position:0%
the dive into the priorities new ham uh
 
01:43:21.990 --> 01:43:22.000 align:start position:0%
the Commission on Aging has identified
 
01:43:24.350 --> 01:43:24.360 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire
 
01:43:26.189 --> 01:43:26.199 align:start position:0%
these are the same four priorities that
 
01:43:28.270 --> 01:43:28.280 align:start position:0%
we had last year it's strengthening
 
01:43:30.470 --> 01:43:30.480 align:start position:0%
systems of care for healthy aging it is
 
01:43:32.830 --> 01:43:32.840 align:start position:0%
growing the Direct Care Workforce it is
 
01:43:34.910 --> 01:43:34.920 align:start position:0%
advancing age-friendly policy systems
 
01:43:37.030 --> 01:43:37.040 align:start position:0%
and environments and calling for the
 
01:43:39.070 --> 01:43:39.080 align:start position:0%
development of a multi- sector plan for
 
01:43:41.870 --> 01:43:41.880 align:start position:0%
Aging in in New Hampshire what we're
 
01:43:43.990 --> 01:43:44.000 align:start position:0%
calling an age well NH
 
01:43:48.229 --> 01:43:48.239 align:start position:0%
plan so in the next Pages we um for each
 
01:43:50.589 --> 01:43:50.599 align:start position:0%
priority we make a case for the priority
 
01:43:52.149 --> 01:43:52.159 align:start position:0%
and then we list recommendations for
 
01:43:53.870 --> 01:43:53.880 align:start position:0%
policy changes that will strengthen our
 
01:43:56.390 --> 01:43:56.400 align:start position:0%
state uh for reference it's those parts
 
01:43:58.750 --> 01:43:58.760 align:start position:0%
are in uh those pages are outlined have
 
01:44:01.030 --> 01:44:01.040 align:start position:0%
a blue box that outlin the
 
01:44:02.589 --> 01:44:02.599 align:start position:0%
recommendations many of the
 
01:44:04.830 --> 01:44:04.840 align:start position:0%
recommendations do have a price tag
 
01:44:07.189 --> 01:44:07.199 align:start position:0%
others um have less of an economic
 
01:44:09.109 --> 01:44:09.119 align:start position:0%
impact for instance one of the
 
01:44:11.310 --> 01:44:11.320 align:start position:0%
recommendations under the system of care
 
01:44:13.510 --> 01:44:13.520 align:start position:0%
is to make the life um safety
 
01:44:17.070 --> 01:44:17.080 align:start position:0%
inspections and the um complaint uh
 
01:44:19.390 --> 01:44:19.400 align:start position:0%
finding um complaint reports with
 
01:44:21.669 --> 01:44:21.679 align:start position:0%
findings um publicly available in
 
01:44:23.270 --> 01:44:23.280 align:start position:0%
assisted living facilities like is
 
01:44:26.350 --> 01:44:26.360 align:start position:0%
already available for nursing
 
01:44:29.109 --> 01:44:29.119 align:start position:0%
facilities so starting on page 24 we
 
01:44:30.589 --> 01:44:30.599 align:start position:0%
highlight the progress made on each
 
01:44:33.510 --> 01:44:33.520 align:start position:0%
priority over the last year um some are
 
01:44:35.910 --> 01:44:35.920 align:start position:0%
programmatic exp uh advances but there's
 
01:44:39.189 --> 01:44:39.199 align:start position:0%
a larger emphasis on the changes um that
 
01:44:41.990 --> 01:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
are result of um changes made by the
 
01:44:45.589 --> 01:44:45.599 align:start position:0%
legislature to public policy so page 34
 
01:44:48.750 --> 01:44:48.760 align:start position:0%
starts our appendices appendix B on page
 
01:44:51.790 --> 01:44:51.800 align:start position:0%
35 provides an overview um provides
 
01:44:54.350 --> 01:44:54.360 align:start position:0%
overview comments made at the 2024
 
01:44:56.709 --> 01:44:56.719 align:start position:0%
long-term care Sumit in Portsmith by two
 
01:44:58.990 --> 01:44:59.000 align:start position:0%
economists looking at how long-term
 
01:45:00.990 --> 01:45:01.000 align:start position:0%
services and supports are funded in our
 
01:45:03.229 --> 01:45:03.239 align:start position:0%
state it also includes additional
 
01:45:05.189 --> 01:45:05.199 align:start position:0%
research by the commission uh to round
 
01:45:08.030 --> 01:45:08.040 align:start position:0%
out the information that was provided um
 
01:45:10.030 --> 01:45:10.040 align:start position:0%
this appendix calls for policy makers to
 
01:45:12.589 --> 01:45:12.599 align:start position:0%
look at diversifying funding streams for
 
01:45:14.629 --> 01:45:14.639 align:start position:0%
Medicaid programs that provide long-term
 
01:45:16.870 --> 01:45:16.880 align:start position:0%
services and supports to low-income
 
01:45:19.350 --> 01:45:19.360 align:start position:0%
individuals the Confluence of a larger
 
01:45:21.510 --> 01:45:21.520 align:start position:0%
older adult population and increasing
 
01:45:23.589 --> 01:45:23.599 align:start position:0%
trends of poverty amongst older adults
 
01:45:26.030 --> 01:45:26.040 align:start position:0%
creates the potential for a larger pool
 
01:45:27.870 --> 01:45:27.880 align:start position:0%
of eligible individuals and suggests
 
01:45:30.189 --> 01:45:30.199 align:start position:0%
significant more dollars will be needed
 
01:45:32.189 --> 01:45:32.199 align:start position:0%
down the road for these
 
01:45:34.629 --> 01:45:34.639 align:start position:0%
programs appendix C the final two pages
 
01:45:36.310 --> 01:45:36.320 align:start position:0%
of the report provides a demographic
 
01:45:38.310 --> 01:45:38.320 align:start position:0%
snapshot of the older adult population
 
01:45:40.790 --> 01:45:40.800 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire the projection chart on
 
01:45:42.629 --> 01:45:42.639 align:start position:0%
the bottom of page 40 might be of
 
01:45:44.430 --> 01:45:44.440 align:start position:0%
greatest greatest interest it really
 
01:45:46.109 --> 01:45:46.119 align:start position:0%
shows the growth of the older adult
 
01:45:48.350 --> 01:45:48.360 align:start position:0%
population that is expected here in New
 
01:45:50.790 --> 01:45:50.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um and that data was developed
 
01:45:52.109 --> 01:45:52.119 align:start position:0%
by the Department of Business and
 
01:45:54.229 --> 01:45:54.239 align:start position:0%
economic affairs
 
01:45:55.550 --> 01:45:55.560 align:start position:0%
um now I'm going to turn the uh the
 
01:45:57.430 --> 01:45:57.440 align:start position:0%
microphone over to Lori Duff who's going
 
01:45:58.790 --> 01:45:58.800 align:start position:0%
to take a little bit more of a deeper
 
01:46:02.669 --> 01:46:02.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:05.109 --> 01:46:05.119 align:start position:0%
plan the first priority I want to speak
 
01:46:07.270 --> 01:46:07.280 align:start position:0%
about is um strengthening the system of
 
01:46:10.229 --> 01:46:10.239 align:start position:0%
care for healthy aging um a system of
 
01:46:12.750 --> 01:46:12.760 align:start position:0%
healthy of care for healthy aging was
 
01:46:15.350 --> 01:46:15.360 align:start position:0%
established in House Bill 2 during the
 
01:46:18.790 --> 01:46:18.800 align:start position:0%
2023 legislative session looking at a
 
01:46:22.390 --> 01:46:22.400 align:start position:0%
particular page no no sir no um you
 
01:46:25.390 --> 01:46:25.400 align:start position:0%
could um it would be
 
01:46:25.400 --> 01:46:28.790 align:start position:0%
could um it would be
page

01:46:28.790 --> 01:46:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:31.830 --> 01:46:31.840 align:start position:0%
eight this recognized that there are an
 
01:46:34.430 --> 01:46:34.440 align:start position:0%
array of needs a person might experience
 
01:46:36.470 --> 01:46:36.480 align:start position:0%
as they age here in the granite state
 
01:46:38.229 --> 01:46:38.239 align:start position:0%
and then ensuring the availability of
 
01:46:41.390 --> 01:46:41.400 align:start position:0%
services was in our best interest the
 
01:46:44.109 --> 01:46:44.119 align:start position:0%
changes made in that house bill too have
 
01:46:45.550 --> 01:46:45.560 align:start position:0%
been helpful towards Shifting the
 
01:46:48.310 --> 01:46:48.320 align:start position:0%
Reliance on long-term supports and
 
01:46:50.629 --> 01:46:50.639 align:start position:0%
services facility-based care such as
 
01:46:50.639 --> 01:46:51.510 align:start position:0%
services facility-based care such as
nursing

01:46:51.510 --> 01:46:51.520 align:start position:0%
nursing
 
01:46:53.910 --> 01:46:53.920 align:start position:0%
homes which is the most expensive
 
01:46:55.870 --> 01:46:55.880 align:start position:0%
setting for care to more Home and
 
01:46:57.430 --> 01:46:57.440 align:start position:0%
Community Based
 
01:46:59.669 --> 01:46:59.679 align:start position:0%
care continuing to strengthen the
 
01:47:01.950 --> 01:47:01.960 align:start position:0%
accessibility of these services will
 
01:47:04.030 --> 01:47:04.040 align:start position:0%
continue to support a shift away from
 
01:47:07.910 --> 01:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
facility based care avoid unnecessary
 
01:47:10.189 --> 01:47:10.199 align:start position:0%
hospitalizations and improve quality of
 
01:47:12.910 --> 01:47:12.920 align:start position:0%
life for older adults in need of support
 
01:47:14.030 --> 01:47:14.040 align:start position:0%
and their
 
01:47:16.550 --> 01:47:16.560 align:start position:0%
caregivers there are a number of good
 
01:47:20.070 --> 01:47:20.080 align:start position:0%
ideas uh you'll see on page 10 and 11 to
 
01:47:22.990 --> 01:47:23.000 align:start position:0%
strengthen the system of care given that
 
01:47:24.910 --> 01:47:24.920 align:start position:0%
this is a very tight budget year we
 
01:47:26.350 --> 01:47:26.360 align:start position:0%
trust that you will see the importance
 
01:47:28.669 --> 01:47:28.679 align:start position:0%
of this and attend that the Bureau of
 
01:47:31.430 --> 01:47:31.440 align:start position:0%
aging and adults Services budget in
 
01:47:33.270 --> 01:47:33.280 align:start position:0%
particular the person centered
 
01:47:35.870 --> 01:47:35.880 align:start position:0%
counseling funds and in the prioritized
 
01:47:38.669 --> 01:47:38.679 align:start position:0%
needs budget choices for independent
 
01:47:41.950 --> 01:47:41.960 align:start position:0%

and increase in reimbursement
 
01:47:56.310 --> 01:47:56.320 align:start position:0%

2023 going to discuss now the second
 
01:48:10.910 --> 01:48:10.920 align:start position:0%
priority in the Council on AG's report
 
01:48:12.830 --> 01:48:12.840 align:start position:0%
is to grow the Direct Care
 
01:48:15.589 --> 01:48:15.599 align:start position:0%
Workforce we all know of the workforce
 
01:48:18.750 --> 01:48:18.760 align:start position:0%
crisis our state is experiencing the
 
01:48:21.189 --> 01:48:21.199 align:start position:0%
commission focuses on the Direct Care
 
01:48:24.950 --> 01:48:24.960 align:start position:0%
Workforce because as often low wage
 
01:48:27.030 --> 01:48:27.040 align:start position:0%
workers they have unique needs that are
 
01:48:30.189 --> 01:48:30.199 align:start position:0%
larger than Workforce initiatives that
 
01:48:32.189 --> 01:48:32.199 align:start position:0%
that aren't attended to and they are
 
01:48:35.790 --> 01:48:35.800 align:start position:0%
critical to the well-being of many older
 
01:48:38.430 --> 01:48:38.440 align:start position:0%
adults it doesn't matter how deep your
 
01:48:40.990 --> 01:48:41.000 align:start position:0%
pokets are to pay for privately pay
 
01:48:43.149 --> 01:48:43.159 align:start position:0%
privately for Services New Hampshire
 
01:48:45.310 --> 01:48:45.320 align:start position:0%
does not have enough workers willing and
 
01:48:48.550 --> 01:48:48.560 align:start position:0%
able to provide the care data cited on
 
01:48:51.310 --> 01:48:51.320 align:start position:0%
page 11 suggests that new New Hampshire
 
01:48:54.589 --> 01:48:54.599 align:start position:0%
has 28 home home healthcare workers per
 
01:48:58.510 --> 01:48:58.520 align:start position:0%
1,000 adults age 65 and older compared

01:49:14.189 --> 01:49:14.199 align:start position:0%
Workforce likely you will see this
 
01:49:17.790 --> 01:49:17.800 align:start position:0%
session a Workforce Omnibus Bill that
 
01:49:21.030 --> 01:49:21.040 align:start position:0%
includes ideas for investments into all

01:49:28.310 --> 01:49:28.320 align:start position:0%
workers another initiative addressing
 
01:49:31.310 --> 01:49:31.320 align:start position:0%
this issue is New Hampshire needs
 
01:49:33.669 --> 01:49:33.679 align:start position:0%
caregivers out of consideration for time
 
01:49:37.350 --> 01:49:37.360 align:start position:0%
I'll point to Pages 16 and 17 for policy
 
01:49:39.310 --> 01:49:39.320 align:start position:0%
recommendations that will serve to
 
01:49:41.550 --> 01:49:41.560 align:start position:0%
support the financial well-being of
 
01:49:43.790 --> 01:49:43.800 align:start position:0%
older adults by helping them to stay in
 
01:49:45.790 --> 01:49:45.800 align:start position:0%
the workforce
 
01:49:48.470 --> 01:49:48.480 align:start position:0%
longer address New Hampshire's housing
 
01:49:50.669 --> 01:49:50.679 align:start position:0%
challenges with innovative ideas for
 
01:49:53.189 --> 01:49:53.199 align:start position:0%
expanding needed housing options for
 
01:49:57.030 --> 01:49:57.040 align:start position:0%
both the older adults and the workforce
 
01:50:00.149 --> 01:50:00.159 align:start position:0%

01:50:02.629 --> 01:50:02.639 align:start position:0%

engagement and mostly decreasing social
 
01:50:14.149 --> 01:50:14.159 align:start position:0%
isolation the final call to action in
 
01:50:17.149 --> 01:50:17.159 align:start position:0%
the report is for policy makers to
 
01:50:19.550 --> 01:50:19.560 align:start position:0%
Advocate the concept of developing a
 
01:50:22.830 --> 01:50:22.840 align:start position:0%
multi- sector plan on Aging while what
 
01:50:25.750 --> 01:50:25.760 align:start position:0%
we call Ag well New Hampshire
 
01:50:28.750 --> 01:50:28.760 align:start position:0%
plan what we've done in this report is a
 
01:50:31.149 --> 01:50:31.159 align:start position:0%
start based on the study the Commission
 
01:50:34.070 --> 01:50:34.080 align:start position:0%
on Aging has done but we need to have a
 
01:50:36.510 --> 01:50:36.520 align:start position:0%
larger audience policy makers like
 
01:50:38.950 --> 01:50:38.960 align:start position:0%
yourself participate in a 10-y year
 
01:50:41.669 --> 01:50:41.679 align:start position:0%
visioning process to address the impacts
 
01:50:43.950 --> 01:50:43.960 align:start position:0%
of the rapidly changing demographics our
 
01:50:45.030 --> 01:50:45.040 align:start position:0%
state is
 
01:50:47.189 --> 01:50:47.199 align:start position:0%
experiencing to best take advantage of
 
01:50:49.589 --> 01:50:49.599 align:start position:0%
the opportunities of this change as well
 
01:50:51.270 --> 01:50:51.280 align:start position:0%
as to address the
 
01:50:53.310 --> 01:50:53.320 align:start position:0%
challenges we will be approaching the
 
01:50:55.550 --> 01:50:55.560 align:start position:0%
new governor to create an executive
 
01:50:58.990 --> 01:50:59.000 align:start position:0%
order calling for this multi- sector
 
01:51:00.270 --> 01:51:00.280 align:start position:0%
plan on
 
01:51:02.669 --> 01:51:02.679 align:start position:0%
Aging we hope that you will see the need
 
01:51:06.069 --> 01:51:06.079 align:start position:0%
as well and also call for the
 
01:51:08.270 --> 01:51:08.280 align:start position:0%
participation in this
 
01:51:10.430 --> 01:51:10.440 align:start position:0%
planning we will be reaching out to you
 
01:51:12.589 --> 01:51:12.599 align:start position:0%
over the coming year to learn your
 
01:51:14.870 --> 01:51:14.880 align:start position:0%
ideas of what would make New Hampshire
 
01:51:16.950 --> 01:51:16.960 align:start position:0%
an even better place to
 
01:51:19.270 --> 01:51:19.280 align:start position:0%
age and we hope that you reach out to
 
01:51:22.189 --> 01:51:22.199 align:start position:0%
your constituents to be asking a similar
 
01:51:24.669 --> 01:51:24.679 align:start position:0%
question the more prepared we are the
 
01:51:27.470 --> 01:51:27.480 align:start position:0%
more resilient we will be we're happy to
 
01:51:30.910 --> 01:51:30.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:33.149 --> 01:51:33.159 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
01:51:35.310 --> 01:51:35.320 align:start position:0%
Merchant uh thank you for this report
 
01:51:37.390 --> 01:51:37.400 align:start position:0%
and thank you Mr chair take the
 
01:51:40.709 --> 01:51:40.719 align:start position:0%
question I really have a passion for
 
01:51:43.629 --> 01:51:43.639 align:start position:0%
this um for multiple reasons but one of
 
01:51:45.310 --> 01:51:45.320 align:start position:0%
the things I'm looking for is the
 
01:51:47.310 --> 01:51:47.320 align:start position:0%
demographics and you talk about that
 
01:51:49.229 --> 01:51:49.239 align:start position:0%
earlier when you look at the
 
01:51:51.589 --> 01:51:51.599 align:start position:0%
demographics um and we have such a
 
01:51:53.550 --> 01:51:53.560 align:start position:0%
disparity between the elderly and the
 
01:51:57.510 --> 01:51:57.520 align:start position:0%
ones behind them providing the service
 
01:52:00.030 --> 01:52:00.040 align:start position:0%
is there any thought or place that
 
01:52:02.189 --> 01:52:02.199 align:start position:0%
people can go because many times a
 
01:52:03.910 --> 01:52:03.920 align:start position:0%
spouse could become a caregiver somebody
 
01:52:05.910 --> 01:52:05.920 align:start position:0%
in the family could become a caregiver
 
01:52:07.950 --> 01:52:07.960 align:start position:0%
is a way for them to be compensated for
 
01:52:10.030 --> 01:52:10.040 align:start position:0%
some of the work that they're doing and
 
01:52:12.550 --> 01:52:12.560 align:start position:0%
then also is there any funds available
 
01:52:15.629 --> 01:52:15.639 align:start position:0%
to help them stay in their home either
 
01:52:18.470 --> 01:52:18.480 align:start position:0%
bathroom facilities um ramps getting
 
01:52:20.910 --> 01:52:20.920 align:start position:0%
into the house it's very expensive to go
 
01:52:22.310 --> 01:52:22.320 align:start position:0%
to institutional care they don't want to
 
01:52:24.470 --> 01:52:24.480 align:start position:0%
go there is very costly so what can we
 
01:52:27.870 --> 01:52:27.880 align:start position:0%
do to help offset some of that
 
01:52:30.149 --> 01:52:30.159 align:start position:0%
cost um do you want to answer the first
 
01:52:33.629 --> 01:52:33.639 align:start position:0%
part about um funds for pay
 
01:52:36.870 --> 01:52:36.880 align:start position:0%
for yes current currently um there are
 
01:52:39.189 --> 01:52:39.199 align:start position:0%
funds um through the choices for
 
01:52:42.750 --> 01:52:42.760 align:start position:0%
Independence program um that enables um
 
01:52:45.229 --> 01:52:45.239 align:start position:0%
a loved one or a a family member or a
 
01:52:48.550 --> 01:52:48.560 align:start position:0%
friend to be paid um through that U that
 
01:52:50.189 --> 01:52:50.199 align:start position:0%
program to take care of an individual
 
01:52:51.790 --> 01:52:51.800 align:start position:0%
there's no other Pro there's no other
 
01:52:53.709 --> 01:52:53.719 align:start position:0%
program other than than that one that is
 
01:52:57.709 --> 01:52:57.719 align:start position:0%
currently paying um and they um are um
 
01:52:59.629 --> 01:52:59.639 align:start position:0%
the individual needs to be high the
 
01:53:01.550 --> 01:53:01.560 align:start position:0%
family member or friend needs to be
 
01:53:05.870 --> 01:53:05.880 align:start position:0%
hired by um um an employer that is
 
01:53:08.310 --> 01:53:08.320 align:start position:0%
providing that service um and then they
 
01:53:10.669 --> 01:53:10.679 align:start position:0%
get a certain number of hours um that's
 
01:53:13.109 --> 01:53:13.119 align:start position:0%
that's provided to them so that but that
 
01:53:14.830 --> 01:53:14.840 align:start position:0%
is the only one that I'm aware of that's
 
01:53:16.550 --> 01:53:16.560 align:start position:0%
that's happening for caregivers so like
 
01:53:21.470 --> 01:53:21.480 align:start position:0%
so Easter sales is does do that yes and
 
01:53:23.030 --> 01:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
um regarding the second question about
 
01:53:25.750 --> 01:53:25.760 align:start position:0%
home modification um you know there are
 
01:53:27.669 --> 01:53:27.679 align:start position:0%
other states that do put more funds into
 
01:53:30.109 --> 01:53:30.119 align:start position:0%
home modification I I'd actually if
 
01:53:32.310 --> 01:53:32.320 align:start position:0%
possible um if Wendy might be willing
 
01:53:33.669 --> 01:53:33.679 align:start position:0%
just to talk a little bit about it the
 
01:53:35.229 --> 01:53:35.239 align:start position:0%
commission itself is a 26 member
 
01:53:36.709 --> 01:53:36.719 align:start position:0%
commission that does has representation
 
01:53:39.390 --> 01:53:39.400 align:start position:0%
from eight state agencies um I do know
 
01:53:43.390 --> 01:53:43.400 align:start position:0%
that DHHS um what had um utilized some
 
01:53:46.229 --> 01:53:46.239 align:start position:0%
covid funds uh during the pandemic to
 
01:53:48.310 --> 01:53:48.320 align:start position:0%
for a home modification program that the
 
01:53:49.910 --> 01:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
people who were participating in the CFI
 
01:53:51.950 --> 01:53:51.960 align:start position:0%
program were able to take advantage of
 
01:53:53.669 --> 01:53:53.679 align:start position:0%
um I don't know about the continuation
 
01:53:56.750 --> 01:53:56.760 align:start position:0%
of those funds um uh I see Wendy shaking
 
01:53:59.430 --> 01:53:59.440 align:start position:0%
her head um I also know that there are
 
01:54:02.350 --> 01:54:02.360 align:start position:0%
some other programs I know um chesher
 
01:54:05.109 --> 01:54:05.119 align:start position:0%
County um sees the benefit of helping of
 
01:54:06.229 --> 01:54:06.239 align:start position:0%
helping people to stay in their
 
01:54:08.430 --> 01:54:08.440 align:start position:0%
communities and so um they have um
 
01:54:09.950 --> 01:54:09.960 align:start position:0%
dedicated some of their own County funds
 
01:54:13.589 --> 01:54:13.599 align:start position:0%
to that purpose um um you know it's a
 
01:54:15.830 --> 01:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
referral program through uh uh social
 
01:54:18.390 --> 01:54:18.400 align:start position:0%
service agencies that that um allow
 
01:54:20.069 --> 01:54:20.079 align:start position:0%
people to get access to those funds to
 
01:54:21.470 --> 01:54:21.480 align:start position:0%
do some home notifications but it's a
 
01:54:23.109 --> 01:54:23.119 align:start position:0%
it's a it's an area where our state
 
01:54:25.069 --> 01:54:25.079 align:start position:0%
needs to do have a lot whole lot more
 
01:54:25.079 --> 01:54:30.550 align:start position:0%
needs to do have a lot whole lot more
development

01:54:30.550 --> 01:54:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:34.270 --> 01:54:34.280 align:start position:0%
happening representative Weber and and
 
01:54:36.270 --> 01:54:36.280 align:start position:0%
in full disclosure I am the chesher
 
01:54:39.669 --> 01:54:39.679 align:start position:0%
county uh member of the Commission on
 
01:54:44.750 --> 01:54:44.760 align:start position:0%
Aging uh and in our County it became
 
01:54:49.030 --> 01:54:49.040 align:start position:0%
clear to us that um investment in home
 
01:54:53.390 --> 01:54:53.400 align:start position:0%
care saves us a lot of expenditure in
 
01:54:57.270 --> 01:54:57.280 align:start position:0%
nursing home care and I guess my
 
01:55:00.629 --> 01:55:00.639 align:start position:0%
question to you is
 
01:55:03.950 --> 01:55:03.960 align:start position:0%
um is in part the purpose of the multis
 
01:55:07.790 --> 01:55:07.800 align:start position:0%
sector plan on Aging HL New
 
01:55:11.189 --> 01:55:11.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh a way of creating something
 
01:55:15.310 --> 01:55:15.320 align:start position:0%
that is in the same nature as our tenure
 
01:55:18.390 --> 01:55:18.400 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Plan where we are planning
 
01:55:20.629 --> 01:55:20.639 align:start position:0%
Beyond an individual
 
01:55:24.910 --> 01:55:24.920 align:start position:0%
bium and as as we heard in a number of
 
01:55:30.629 --> 01:55:30.639 align:start position:0%
areas earlier today the argument and the
 
01:55:34.510 --> 01:55:34.520 align:start position:0%
documentation for the expenditure of
 
01:55:37.030 --> 01:55:37.040 align:start position:0%
certain funds
 
01:55:42.030 --> 01:55:42.040 align:start position:0%
upfront which will then be an investment
 
01:55:42.040 --> 01:55:43.069 align:start position:0%
upfront which will then be an investment
that

01:55:43.069 --> 01:55:43.079 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:55:46.950 --> 01:55:46.960 align:start position:0%
provides significant savings down the
 
01:55:49.990 --> 01:55:50.000 align:start position:0%
road because with a
 
01:55:52.750 --> 01:55:52.760 align:start position:0%
2year banial budget
 
01:55:52.760 --> 01:55:53.790 align:start position:0%
2year banial budget
it's

01:55:53.790 --> 01:55:53.800 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:55:57.550 --> 01:55:57.560 align:start position:0%
always easiest to look at what's going
 
01:56:03.470 --> 01:56:03.480 align:start position:0%
on right now and not plan for how we can
 
01:56:07.550 --> 01:56:07.560 align:start position:0%
leverage advantages going
 
01:56:10.270 --> 01:56:10.280 align:start position:0%
forward um that's that's absolutely
 
01:56:12.310 --> 01:56:12.320 align:start position:0%
correct um and that that's a little bit
 
01:56:14.030 --> 01:56:14.040 align:start position:0%
of the point of that appendix B that I
 
01:56:16.669 --> 01:56:16.679 align:start position:0%
pointed out is is that um there is going
 
01:56:19.470 --> 01:56:19.480 align:start position:0%
to be increasing needs and uh increasing
 
01:56:22.550 --> 01:56:22.560 align:start position:0%
strains on our our programs and services
 
01:56:24.270 --> 01:56:24.280 align:start position:0%
and and we need to look further out than
 
01:56:27.069 --> 01:56:27.079 align:start position:0%
two years we need a 10-year vision and
 
01:56:30.669 --> 01:56:30.679 align:start position:0%
and and that uh creates bench marks
 
01:56:33.550 --> 01:56:33.560 align:start position:0%
along the way that um towards uh the
 
01:56:35.350 --> 01:56:35.360 align:start position:0%
change that we we need to have in our
 
01:56:37.470 --> 01:56:37.480 align:start position:0%
state uh and we can't turn on and off
 
01:56:39.310 --> 01:56:39.320 align:start position:0%
that light switch uh there needs to be
 
01:56:46.470 --> 01:56:46.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:48.910 --> 01:56:48.920 align:start position:0%
along you have two
 
01:56:51.350 --> 01:56:51.360 align:start position:0%
minutes no I just want to make in this
 
01:56:52.709 --> 01:56:52.719 align:start position:0%
part of the room not over over there
 
01:56:55.069 --> 01:56:55.079 align:start position:0%
somehow okay Mr chairman I just want to
 
01:56:58.229 --> 01:56:58.239 align:start position:0%
make a public comment that has been a
