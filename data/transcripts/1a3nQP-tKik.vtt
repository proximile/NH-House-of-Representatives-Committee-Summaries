people that might have some type of
 
00:29:09.350 --> 00:29:09.360 align:start position:0%
authority is very important um a little
 
00:29:11.590 --> 00:29:11.600 align:start position:0%
bit about myself my name is Maryann jock
 
00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:13.840 align:start position:0%

country of New Hampshire I grew up in
 
00:29:18.710 --> 00:29:18.720 align:start position:0%
Lisbon New Hampshire lived for 15 years
 
00:29:20.509 --> 00:29:20.519 align:start position:0%
in Pittsburgh New Hampshire my husband
 
00:29:23.909 --> 00:29:23.919 align:start position:0%
is also from the North Country I was a
 
00:29:26.389 --> 00:29:26.399 align:start position:0%
public school teacher in New Hampshire
 
00:29:28.630 --> 00:29:28.640 align:start position:0%

00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
business currently I am out of the
 
00:29:37.830 --> 00:29:37.840 align:start position:0%
teaching profession and I am a career

00:29:44.070 --> 00:29:44.080 align:start position:0%
elected president of Romance Writers of
 
00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
America which is the only Trade
 
00:29:49.630 --> 00:29:49.640 align:start position:0%
Organization for that industry in the
 
00:29:53.990 --> 00:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
United States so I am well aware of the
 
00:29:57.070 --> 00:29:57.080 align:start position:0%
importance of all of these things um the
 
00:29:59.830 --> 00:29:59.840 align:start position:0%
reason Reon why I took the position
 
00:30:02.269 --> 00:30:02.279 align:start position:0%
there was to help increase diversity and
 
00:30:04.590 --> 00:30:04.600 align:start position:0%
inclusion within the romance industry
 
00:30:07.149 --> 00:30:07.159 align:start position:0%
but the publishing industry as a whole
 
00:30:12.430 --> 00:30:12.440 align:start position:0%
so um why am I here I am here because in
 
00:30:14.470 --> 00:30:14.480 align:start position:0%
October of
 
00:30:18.750 --> 00:30:18.760 align:start position:0%
2021 my tiny little Street of Eight
 
00:30:21.509 --> 00:30:21.519 align:start position:0%
houses Dead End Street in Lisbon New
 
00:30:26.909 --> 00:30:26.919 align:start position:0%
Hampshire was um turned upside down we
 
00:30:30.110 --> 00:30:30.120 align:start position:0%
had a family that moved in and we did
 
00:30:33.909 --> 00:30:33.919 align:start position:0%
not know at the time that the husband in
 
00:30:36.269 --> 00:30:36.279 align:start position:0%
the family was about to be let out on
 
00:30:42.509 --> 00:30:42.519 align:start position:0%
parole for um uh the the current uh
 
00:30:46.110 --> 00:30:46.120 align:start position:0%
charge that he was serving time for was
 
00:30:49.310 --> 00:30:49.320 align:start position:0%
extortion of the Elliott hospital and
 
00:30:54.669 --> 00:30:54.679 align:start position:0%
that was after a long line of time in
 
00:30:57.430 --> 00:30:57.440 align:start position:0%
the system he is 52 years old he has has
 
00:31:00.029 --> 00:31:00.039 align:start position:0%
more convictions and many of them
 
00:31:03.950 --> 00:31:03.960 align:start position:0%
felonies than he has years of life he
 
00:31:07.549 --> 00:31:07.559 align:start position:0%
understands the justice system to he
 
00:31:07.559 --> 00:31:09.310 align:start position:0%
understands the justice system to he
could

00:31:09.310 --> 00:31:09.320 align:start position:0%
could
 
00:31:12.269 --> 00:31:12.279 align:start position:0%
probably give any lawyer a run for their
 
00:31:14.549 --> 00:31:14.559 align:start position:0%
money as far as what he can and cannot
 
00:31:18.190 --> 00:31:18.200 align:start position:0%
get away with the unfortunate thing is I
 
00:31:20.029 --> 00:31:20.039 align:start position:0%
grew up in a middle class neighborhood
 
00:31:23.750 --> 00:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
raised by family that were lifetime New
 
00:31:27.230 --> 00:31:27.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents with a work ethic a
 
00:31:29.909 --> 00:31:29.919 align:start position:0%
belief in volunteering and a belief in
 
00:31:31.710 --> 00:31:31.720 align:start position:0%
if you see something that you can make
 
00:31:33.389 --> 00:31:33.399 align:start position:0%
better you should do
 
00:31:37.430 --> 00:31:37.440 align:start position:0%
that um I don't know the system I've
 
00:31:40.389 --> 00:31:40.399 align:start position:0%
never been in the system I've never had
 
00:31:43.350 --> 00:31:43.360 align:start position:0%
to deal with the justice system I was
 
00:31:45.470 --> 00:31:45.480 align:start position:0%
raised with the belief that the justice
 
00:31:49.110 --> 00:31:49.120 align:start position:0%
system was put in place to protect
 
00:31:51.269 --> 00:31:51.279 align:start position:0%
citizens that followed the
 
00:31:54.590 --> 00:31:54.600 align:start position:0%
rules and that if I ever got into a
 
00:31:56.789 --> 00:31:56.799 align:start position:0%
position where I needed somebody to
 
00:31:59.269 --> 00:31:59.279 align:start position:0%
protect to me and help me that law
 
00:32:01.269 --> 00:32:01.279 align:start position:0%
enforcement would be able to do that
 
00:32:03.350 --> 00:32:03.360 align:start position:0%
because they protect their citizens
 
00:32:06.830 --> 00:32:06.840 align:start position:0%
that's their job I have since
 
00:32:10.710 --> 00:32:10.720 align:start position:0%
learned that the system is not there to
 
00:32:14.230 --> 00:32:14.240 align:start position:0%
do that because in order to have a
 
00:32:16.669 --> 00:32:16.679 align:start position:0%
system that works for you you have to be
 
00:32:18.750 --> 00:32:18.760 align:start position:0%
educated in that system and as a
 
00:32:20.470 --> 00:32:20.480 align:start position:0%
law-abiding citizen who never had to
 
00:32:21.990 --> 00:32:22.000 align:start position:0%
deal with it I never had to educate
 
00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
myself about it um we have been told
 
00:32:28.029 --> 00:32:28.039 align:start position:0%
repeatedly by the police that that
 
00:32:30.269 --> 00:32:30.279 align:start position:0%
anything they could do would not be
 
00:32:32.710 --> 00:32:32.720 align:start position:0%
enough and there's no point in doing it
 
00:32:34.669 --> 00:32:34.679 align:start position:0%
until he is
 
00:32:37.669 --> 00:32:37.679 align:start position:0%
violent and I fully trust that the
 
00:32:40.470 --> 00:32:40.480 align:start position:0%
police are doing everything they can
 
00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:43.080 align:start position:0%
this man could you um could you tell us
 
00:32:45.669 --> 00:32:45.679 align:start position:0%
what he did since moving in that caused
 
00:32:49.950 --> 00:32:49.960 align:start position:0%
us uh what hasn't he done um one of the
 
00:32:52.389 --> 00:32:52.399 align:start position:0%
things that is terribly upsetting and
 
00:32:54.990 --> 00:32:55.000 align:start position:0%
I'm sure all of you most of you maybe
 
00:32:57.110 --> 00:32:57.120 align:start position:0%
have the same experience that the the
 
00:32:59.389 --> 00:32:59.399 align:start position:0%
idea of living a in a place where people
 
00:33:00.590 --> 00:33:00.600 align:start position:0%
just start
 
00:33:04.190 --> 00:33:04.200 align:start position:0%
screaming swears and veiled threats and
 
00:33:07.269 --> 00:33:07.279 align:start position:0%
not so veiled threats through through
 
00:33:09.909 --> 00:33:09.919 align:start position:0%
the neighborhood is something that
 
00:33:14.590 --> 00:33:14.600 align:start position:0%
happens on a TV show in New York City in
 
00:33:17.669 --> 00:33:17.679 align:start position:0%
in you know a a very low socioeconomic
 
00:33:22.470 --> 00:33:22.480 align:start position:0%
area this is our daily reality um he
 
00:33:24.509 --> 00:33:24.519 align:start position:0%
when he first moved in started screaming
 
00:33:26.230 --> 00:33:26.240 align:start position:0%
that he was going to burn all our houses
 
00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
down that he was going to have his
 
00:33:31.350 --> 00:33:31.360 align:start position:0%
buddies come and take care of
 
00:33:35.470 --> 00:33:35.480 align:start position:0%
us um he has the tendency right now he
 
00:33:39.149 --> 00:33:39.159 align:start position:0%
focuses on me I refuse to allow him to
 
00:33:40.990 --> 00:33:41.000 align:start position:0%
make me a victim and therefore I will
 
00:33:44.350 --> 00:33:44.360 align:start position:0%
not react to anything he does but that
 
00:33:47.990 --> 00:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
just puts the focus more on me um we did
 
00:33:50.110 --> 00:33:50.120 align:start position:0%
have a safety net with him being on
 
00:33:54.830 --> 00:33:54.840 align:start position:0%
parole because he many times um violated
 
00:33:56.710 --> 00:33:56.720 align:start position:0%
his parole and ended up going back to
 
00:33:58.389 --> 00:33:58.399 align:start position:0%
prison prison the first time it was like
 
00:34:00.909 --> 00:34:00.919 align:start position:0%
30 days then it was 60 days and then I
 
00:34:03.830 --> 00:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
believe this last stint was 3 months
 
00:34:09.030 --> 00:34:09.040 align:start position:0%
when he came back from um his parole
 
00:34:11.669 --> 00:34:11.679 align:start position:0%
this last time he had finished serving
 
00:34:14.190 --> 00:34:14.200 align:start position:0%
out his sentence he is no longer on
 
00:34:16.909 --> 00:34:16.919 align:start position:0%
parole and under supervision and two
 
00:34:19.349 --> 00:34:19.359 align:start position:0%
days after he came back he stood in the
 
00:34:21.790 --> 00:34:21.800 align:start position:0%
middle of our street and screamed up the
 
00:34:23.710 --> 00:34:23.720 align:start position:0%
street that there was nobody to protect
 
00:34:27.149 --> 00:34:27.159 align:start position:0%
us now and we could call the cops all we
 
00:34:30.310 --> 00:34:30.320 align:start position:0%
wanted but he would just go and pay his3
 
00:34:32.710 --> 00:34:32.720 align:start position:0%
or $40 and be home in two hours to
 
00:34:34.909 --> 00:34:34.919 align:start position:0%
continue what he was
 
00:34:38.149 --> 00:34:38.159 align:start position:0%
doing we again have talked repeatedly to
 
00:34:42.669 --> 00:34:42.679 align:start position:0%
the police and they say call they say we
 
00:34:44.669 --> 00:34:44.679 align:start position:0%
we have at my house what I call the book
 
00:34:46.710 --> 00:34:46.720 align:start position:0%
of and I'm not going to say his his
 
00:34:50.629 --> 00:34:50.639 align:start position:0%
first name but we have been keeping that
 
00:34:53.230 --> 00:34:53.240 align:start position:0%
and recording the things that he does
 
00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:55.200 align:start position:0%
and the things that he screams we have
 
00:34:57.510 --> 00:34:57.520 align:start position:0%
had to buy security cameras
 
00:35:00.510 --> 00:35:00.520 align:start position:0%
and put no posted uh no trespassing
 
00:35:03.310 --> 00:35:03.320 align:start position:0%
signs on our house I work from home I am
 
00:35:06.150 --> 00:35:06.160 align:start position:0%
usually the only one on the street
 
00:35:09.150 --> 00:35:09.160 align:start position:0%
during the day by myself I have to have
 
00:35:11.630 --> 00:35:11.640 align:start position:0%
my house locked all the time because he
 
00:35:13.710 --> 00:35:13.720 align:start position:0%
knows I'm home alone and he knows that
 
00:35:15.510 --> 00:35:15.520 align:start position:0%
there's nobody else on the street he
 
00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
does not work nobody in the house Works
 
00:35:23.510 --> 00:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
um currently we're in a situation where
 
00:35:26.349 --> 00:35:26.359 align:start position:0%
he's also abusing the stalking and
 
00:35:30.310 --> 00:35:30.320 align:start position:0%
harassment order process he has stocking
 
00:35:32.710 --> 00:35:32.720 align:start position:0%
and harassment orders out on my husband
 
00:35:35.990 --> 00:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
and myself conveniently my husband is a
 
00:35:38.030 --> 00:35:38.040 align:start position:0%
hunter and it just happens to be opening
 
00:35:40.150 --> 00:35:40.160 align:start position:0%
day next Wednesday and my husband has
 
00:35:43.710 --> 00:35:43.720 align:start position:0%
had to relinquish all of his guns to the
 
00:35:46.470 --> 00:35:46.480 align:start position:0%
police department because as soon as
 
00:35:48.230 --> 00:35:48.240 align:start position:0%
there's a stalking or harassment order
 
00:35:50.670 --> 00:35:50.680 align:start position:0%
put on you for safety reasons they do
 
00:35:52.790 --> 00:35:52.800 align:start position:0%
that and and we both understand why
 
00:35:54.990 --> 00:35:55.000 align:start position:0%
stocking and harassment and restrainment
 
00:35:59.190 --> 00:35:59.200 align:start position:0%
orders are set up that way um and in a
 
00:36:01.109 --> 00:36:01.119 align:start position:0%
perfect system where somebody is not
 
00:36:03.950 --> 00:36:03.960 align:start position:0%
abusing it and using it by proxy to
 
00:36:07.710 --> 00:36:07.720 align:start position:0%
torment or harass good citizens I
 
00:36:10.630 --> 00:36:10.640 align:start position:0%
understand why it works um I have I have
 
00:36:12.430 --> 00:36:12.440 align:start position:0%
I own a shotgun because I used to go
 
00:36:16.390 --> 00:36:16.400 align:start position:0%
bird hunting I now own a Sig sour
 
00:36:20.150 --> 00:36:20.160 align:start position:0%
Pro of of my own that I make sure is
 
00:36:22.950 --> 00:36:22.960 align:start position:0%
between myself and my front door every
 
00:36:26.230 --> 00:36:26.240 align:start position:0%
single day at home in a tiny little dead
 
00:36:28.190 --> 00:36:28.200 align:start position:0%
end Street in Lisbon New Hampshire that
 
00:36:31.190 --> 00:36:31.200 align:start position:0%
has eight houses on it that I grew up in
 
00:36:33.910 --> 00:36:33.920 align:start position:0%
the house I own now is four generations
 
00:36:36.190 --> 00:36:36.200 align:start position:0%
in my family and I'm actually
 
00:36:38.430 --> 00:36:38.440 align:start position:0%
considering is it just is it worth it to
 
00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:39.390 align:start position:0%
considering is it just is it worth it to
keep

00:36:39.390 --> 00:36:39.400 align:start position:0%
keep
 
00:36:43.470 --> 00:36:43.480 align:start position:0%
it and um the reason why I'm here
 
00:36:46.950 --> 00:36:46.960 align:start position:0%
today is because first off I do not
 
00:36:49.589 --> 00:36:49.599 align:start position:0%
believe in just accepting my lot in
 
00:36:52.550 --> 00:36:52.560 align:start position:0%
life there there's always a solution
 
00:36:55.630 --> 00:36:55.640 align:start position:0%
there's always a better way and in
 
00:36:58.069 --> 00:36:58.079 align:start position:0%
trying to learn Le what we need to do in
 
00:36:59.910 --> 00:36:59.920 align:start position:0%
this system because we don't know the
 
00:37:02.030 --> 00:37:02.040 align:start position:0%
police can only tell us what they know
 
00:37:04.550 --> 00:37:04.560 align:start position:0%
parole can only tell us what they know
 
00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:06.640 align:start position:0%
and for some reason one hand does not
 
00:37:08.670 --> 00:37:08.680 align:start position:0%
know what the other is doing most of the
 
00:37:12.910 --> 00:37:12.920 align:start position:0%
time and I called the parole department
 
00:37:15.309 --> 00:37:15.319 align:start position:0%
for grafting County and again I'm not
 
00:37:17.030 --> 00:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
going to say names I'm not here to point
 
00:37:19.710 --> 00:37:19.720 align:start position:0%
any fingers but I talked to somebody in
 
00:37:23.710 --> 00:37:23.720 align:start position:0%
charge there and that person did not
 
00:37:26.750 --> 00:37:26.760 align:start position:0%
know anything about me other than that I
 
00:37:28.750 --> 00:37:28.760 align:start position:0%
had this particular person living next
 
00:37:32.150 --> 00:37:32.160 align:start position:0%
to me and that I was clearly a woman um
 
00:37:34.190 --> 00:37:34.200 align:start position:0%
the first five minutes of the
 
00:37:37.069 --> 00:37:37.079 align:start position:0%
conversation literally went like I was
 
00:37:40.069 --> 00:37:40.079 align:start position:0%
wasting this man's time and he treated
 
00:37:42.750 --> 00:37:42.760 align:start position:0%
me and excuse the the term but it's the
 
00:37:45.790 --> 00:37:45.800 align:start position:0%
only way I could think of what I was was
 
00:37:48.550 --> 00:37:48.560 align:start position:0%
in his mind that I was the crack hor
 
00:37:52.109 --> 00:37:52.119 align:start position:0%
next door in the slum house and that I
 
00:37:56.430 --> 00:37:56.440 align:start position:0%
was just completely wasting his time and
 
00:37:59.470 --> 00:37:59.480 align:start position:0%
um um I took a breath and I said let us
 
00:38:02.030 --> 00:38:02.040 align:start position:0%
get something straight I probably have
 
00:38:03.670 --> 00:38:03.680 align:start position:0%
more college degrees than you I
 
00:38:05.670 --> 00:38:05.680 align:start position:0%
definitely have a better vocabulary than
 
00:38:09.030 --> 00:38:09.040 align:start position:0%
you and I do not live in a place where I
 
00:38:11.430 --> 00:38:11.440 align:start position:0%
also have warrants out for my arrest I
 
00:38:15.309 --> 00:38:15.319 align:start position:0%
have power in my voice and you need to
 
00:38:17.950 --> 00:38:17.960 align:start position:0%
listen to me because I'm a
 
00:38:21.150 --> 00:38:21.160 align:start position:0%
citizen and he did change his attitude a
 
00:38:23.150 --> 00:38:23.160 align:start position:0%
little bit I did not get any further
 
00:38:25.430 --> 00:38:25.440 align:start position:0%
answers the only answers I got was that
 
00:38:29.109 --> 00:38:29.119 align:start position:0%
he actually wasn't even aware aware of
 
00:38:32.150 --> 00:38:32.160 align:start position:0%
the the provisions of him being out on
 
00:38:35.190 --> 00:38:35.200 align:start position:0%
parole I only knew them because I had
 
00:38:36.550 --> 00:38:36.560 align:start position:0%
gone to the bail
 
00:38:38.589 --> 00:38:38.599 align:start position:0%
hearing or not the bail hearing the
 
00:38:40.870 --> 00:38:40.880 align:start position:0%
parole hearing my husband and I have
 
00:38:42.950 --> 00:38:42.960 align:start position:0%
made it a point to go to all of those
 
00:38:45.069 --> 00:38:45.079 align:start position:0%
parole hearings because it was the only
 
00:38:47.390 --> 00:38:47.400 align:start position:0%
way we could learn anything and know how
 
00:38:50.589 --> 00:38:50.599 align:start position:0%
to protect ourselves in this
 
00:38:53.870 --> 00:38:53.880 align:start position:0%
situation um as an independent who
 
00:38:58.109 --> 00:38:58.119 align:start position:0%
swings very liberal I I
 
00:39:00.750 --> 00:39:00.760 align:start position:0%
appreciate the
 
00:39:05.470 --> 00:39:05.480 align:start position:0%
um the intent in bail law I do not
 
00:39:07.870 --> 00:39:07.880 align:start position:0%
believe that people with a first offense
 
00:39:09.870 --> 00:39:09.880 align:start position:0%
or somebody that's in the wrong place at
 
00:39:13.150 --> 00:39:13.160 align:start position:0%
the wrong time or God forbid a teenager
 
00:39:15.069 --> 00:39:15.079 align:start position:0%
that has had trauma that's trying to
 
00:39:17.589 --> 00:39:17.599 align:start position:0%
work through it deserves to be sitting
 
00:39:20.510 --> 00:39:20.520 align:start position:0%
in a jail cell for months on end before
 
00:39:23.030 --> 00:39:23.040 align:start position:0%
they have a chance to have a hearing I
 
00:39:26.950 --> 00:39:26.960 align:start position:0%
understand the intent of bail reform the
 
00:39:29.030 --> 00:39:29.040 align:start position:0%
the follow through through and the
 
00:39:33.030 --> 00:39:33.040 align:start position:0%
reality of it leaves a lot to be desired
 
00:39:35.670 --> 00:39:35.680 align:start position:0%
and I think it has not come to light
 
00:39:39.990 --> 00:39:40.000 align:start position:0%
because most people here and most people
 
00:39:42.750 --> 00:39:42.760 align:start position:0%
that that feel that their vote has
 
00:39:45.750 --> 00:39:45.760 align:start position:0%
something to do or or has some power in
 
00:39:48.710 --> 00:39:48.720 align:start position:0%
this state have not had to live
 
00:39:51.390 --> 00:39:51.400 align:start position:0%
surrounded by these
 
00:39:55.270 --> 00:39:55.280 align:start position:0%
people that that are taking the bail
 
00:39:57.550 --> 00:39:57.560 align:start position:0%
reform and th throwing it back in the
 
00:40:00.510 --> 00:40:00.520 align:start position:0%
state's face those are the people that
 
00:40:02.829 --> 00:40:02.839 align:start position:0%
don't have the voice that feel like they
 
00:40:06.349 --> 00:40:06.359 align:start position:0%
don't have the power
 
00:40:09.750 --> 00:40:09.760 align:start position:0%
and I do I can come in here and I can
 
00:40:14.589 --> 00:40:14.599 align:start position:0%
speak to all of you on an even level and
 
00:40:16.790 --> 00:40:16.800 align:start position:0%
understand that my voice does
 
00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:19.710 align:start position:0%
understand that my voice does
matter

00:40:19.710 --> 00:40:19.720 align:start position:0%
matter
 
00:40:23.109 --> 00:40:23.119 align:start position:0%
so I said I wasn't going to cry it's
 
00:40:25.670 --> 00:40:25.680 align:start position:0%
more rage cry women in here probably
 
00:40:28.309 --> 00:40:28.319 align:start position:0%
understand the the the whole thing but
 
00:40:30.990 --> 00:40:31.000 align:start position:0%
um you know it's just
 
00:40:35.510 --> 00:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
frustrating because I'm scared in my own
 
00:40:39.470 --> 00:40:39.480 align:start position:0%
home and the police have basically
 
00:40:42.630 --> 00:40:42.640 align:start position:0%
said until he hurts somebody and it's a
 
00:40:44.990 --> 00:40:45.000 align:start position:0%
felony level offense and there's blood
 
00:40:47.870 --> 00:40:47.880 align:start position:0%
involved we can't do much other than
 
00:40:52.309 --> 00:40:52.319 align:start position:0%
show up and record it and go
 
00:40:55.790 --> 00:40:55.800 align:start position:0%
home so my next step is to go to the
 
00:40:58.190 --> 00:40:58.200 align:start position:0%
people that make make the decisions and
 
00:41:01.990 --> 00:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
tell you my story so you understand that
 
00:41:05.109 --> 00:41:05.119 align:start position:0%
this is a serious problem his mental
 
00:41:08.069 --> 00:41:08.079 align:start position:0%
illness whatever it may be should not
 
00:41:10.710 --> 00:41:10.720 align:start position:0%
Trump my own mental health and sense of
 
00:41:14.670 --> 00:41:14.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:17.910 --> 00:41:17.920 align:start position:0%
home ma'am could you tell us um what you
 
00:41:21.710 --> 00:41:21.720 align:start position:0%
would like to see us do as as as far as
 
00:41:24.790 --> 00:41:24.800 align:start position:0%
this goes with relate to R to bail you
 
00:41:28.109 --> 00:41:28.119 align:start position:0%
know from what I've Been Told by law
 
00:41:30.829 --> 00:41:30.839 align:start position:0%
enforcement it now that he's out on
 
00:41:33.150 --> 00:41:33.160 align:start position:0%
parole that he's
 
00:41:36.109 --> 00:41:36.119 align:start position:0%
basically it it's kind of a clean slate
 
00:41:38.589 --> 00:41:38.599 align:start position:0%
that one thing doesn't he he can be
 
00:41:41.109 --> 00:41:41.119 align:start position:0%
pulled in for one thing this week and
 
00:41:44.109 --> 00:41:44.119 align:start position:0%
pays his bail and goes home and he can
 
00:41:45.870 --> 00:41:45.880 align:start position:0%
have something happen next week and he
 
00:41:48.309 --> 00:41:48.319 align:start position:0%
goes and pays his bail and goes home and
 
00:41:50.470 --> 00:41:50.480 align:start position:0%
there's no okay well you've been in here
 
00:41:54.109 --> 00:41:54.119 align:start position:0%
four times this week with chargeable
 
00:41:56.630 --> 00:41:56.640 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor you know maybe this is needs
 
00:41:58.390 --> 00:41:58.400 align:start position:0%
to maybe you need to stay until you can
 
00:42:02.230 --> 00:42:02.240 align:start position:0%
see a judge maybe after four
 
00:42:05.150 --> 00:42:05.160 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors you know we bump it up to a
 
00:42:08.150 --> 00:42:08.160 align:start position:0%
felony charge I I do not know because I
 
00:42:10.430 --> 00:42:10.440 align:start position:0%
have not done all of the resources uh
 
00:42:13.309 --> 00:42:13.319 align:start position:0%
research but I do know that he's not
 
00:42:16.950 --> 00:42:16.960 align:start position:0%
only causing my family financial
 
00:42:19.470 --> 00:42:19.480 align:start position:0%
hardship because we're having to pay for
 
00:42:22.349 --> 00:42:22.359 align:start position:0%
secur uh for surveillance cameras I've
 
00:42:24.910 --> 00:42:24.920 align:start position:0%
had to buy a dash camera I've had to buy
 
00:42:28.549 --> 00:42:28.559 align:start position:0%
a handgun we just had to um get our
 
00:42:30.309 --> 00:42:30.319 align:start position:0%
lawyer involved because of these
 
00:42:33.190 --> 00:42:33.200 align:start position:0%
restraining orders and it's just an
 
00:42:37.309 --> 00:42:37.319 align:start position:0%
ongoing thing and I know 100% that it's
 
00:42:40.109 --> 00:42:40.119 align:start position:0%
putting a strain on the
 
00:42:43.710 --> 00:42:43.720 align:start position:0%
municipality of the town because he's
 
00:42:45.510 --> 00:42:45.520 align:start position:0%
not the only one in town that does this
 
00:42:48.710 --> 00:42:48.720 align:start position:0%
we have four full-time police officers
 
00:42:52.349 --> 00:42:52.359 align:start position:0%
and they right now have 400 open cases
 
00:42:55.430 --> 00:42:55.440 align:start position:0%
in tiny little Lisbon New Hampshire and
 
00:42:59.150 --> 00:42:59.160 align:start position:0%
I'm a taxpayer so I fully know how much
 
00:43:03.390 --> 00:43:03.400 align:start position:0%
this Ridiculousness is costing me as a
 
00:43:07.750 --> 00:43:07.760 align:start position:0%
taxpayer and my town we can't do things
 
00:43:10.150 --> 00:43:10.160 align:start position:0%
that we would want for the citizens of
 
00:43:11.630 --> 00:43:11.640 align:start position:0%
the town because we have to put our
 
00:43:15.030 --> 00:43:15.040 align:start position:0%
money over here and it just feels like
 
00:43:18.109 --> 00:43:18.119 align:start position:0%
every single place I look they're just
 
00:43:20.589 --> 00:43:20.599 align:start position:0%
chasing their tails and there's nothing
 
00:43:22.950 --> 00:43:22.960 align:start position:0%
happening could um could you tell us
 
00:43:25.150 --> 00:43:25.160 align:start position:0%
what what the status is how did you
 
00:43:27.069 --> 00:43:27.079 align:start position:0%
already have a hearing in court on the
 
00:43:28.790 --> 00:43:28.800 align:start position:0%
um stocking orders he got against your
 
00:43:31.069 --> 00:43:31.079 align:start position:0%
husband um we have had stocking orders
 
00:43:34.910 --> 00:43:34.920 align:start position:0%
in the past on us what the first one was
 
00:43:37.750 --> 00:43:37.760 align:start position:0%
dropped before the hearing even happened
 
00:43:41.390 --> 00:43:41.400 align:start position:0%
the second one uh we actually I got to
 
00:43:44.190 --> 00:43:44.200 align:start position:0%
the courthouse with my lawyer I walked
 
00:43:48.069 --> 00:43:48.079 align:start position:0%
in and his wife who because he was in
 
00:43:51.349 --> 00:43:51.359 align:start position:0%
prison at the time his wife dropped the
 
00:43:53.750 --> 00:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
suit or dropped the order before the
 
00:43:56.829 --> 00:43:56.839 align:start position:0%
hearing started in there this one
 
00:43:59.829 --> 00:43:59.839 align:start position:0%
because my husband's because hunting
 
00:44:01.470 --> 00:44:01.480 align:start position:0%
season starts on Wednesday and he's
 
00:44:03.190 --> 00:44:03.200 align:start position:0%
supposed to be leaving Sunday for
 
00:44:07.630 --> 00:44:07.640 align:start position:0%
hunting camp um we went to the the court
 
00:44:10.349 --> 00:44:10.359 align:start position:0%
yesterday and asked for a quicker
 
00:44:13.990 --> 00:44:14.000 align:start position:0%
hearing and we have a hearing on Tuesday
 
00:44:16.309 --> 00:44:16.319 align:start position:0%
that we will have our lawyer at and I've
 
00:44:18.829 --> 00:44:18.839 align:start position:0%
been compiling surveillance videos and
 
00:44:20.990 --> 00:44:21.000 align:start position:0%
writing up my statements and doing
 
00:44:23.270 --> 00:44:23.280 align:start position:0%
everything that I shouldn't be doing
 
00:44:25.150 --> 00:44:25.160 align:start position:0%
because I have other more pressing
 
00:44:26.870 --> 00:44:26.880 align:start position:0%
things to do
 
00:44:29.109 --> 00:44:29.119 align:start position:0%
did um okay so the the order that's in
 
00:44:30.910 --> 00:44:30.920 align:start position:0%
place now against your husband or both
 
00:44:33.630 --> 00:44:33.640 align:start position:0%
of you is just the temporary order until
 
00:44:35.470 --> 00:44:35.480 align:start position:0%
it gets to the what happens is when you
 
00:44:37.230 --> 00:44:37.240 align:start position:0%
have a stocking or harassment order put
 
00:44:39.270 --> 00:44:39.280 align:start position:0%
against you immediately first off you
 
00:44:41.630 --> 00:44:41.640 align:start position:0%
lose your second amendment rights and
 
00:44:45.230 --> 00:44:45.240 align:start position:0%
whatever the plaintiff wrote in the
 
00:44:48.030 --> 00:44:48.040 align:start position:0%
stocking order about what they
 
00:44:51.549 --> 00:44:51.559 align:start position:0%
want um the defendant to have to follow
 
00:44:53.750 --> 00:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
the if the judge chooses to sign off on
 
00:44:57.990 --> 00:44:58.000 align:start position:0%
it without any proof of that behavior at
 
00:45:01.470 --> 00:45:01.480 align:start position:0%
all that is that so I can't go 300 feet
 
00:45:03.309 --> 00:45:03.319 align:start position:0%
towards his house which it is now
 
00:45:05.270 --> 00:45:05.280 align:start position:0%
November I don't go out into my yard
 
00:45:07.309 --> 00:45:07.319 align:start position:0%
until it's 70 degrees again so that
 
00:45:11.630 --> 00:45:11.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't impact me at all I have to um I
 
00:45:13.549 --> 00:45:13.559 align:start position:0%
have to drive past his house to get off
 
00:45:16.230 --> 00:45:16.240 align:start position:0%
my street it's a dead end street so for
 
00:45:18.349 --> 00:45:18.359 align:start position:0%
a while the first time that was a
 
00:45:19.950 --> 00:45:19.960 align:start position:0%
question whether I was even going to be
 
00:45:22.990 --> 00:45:23.000 align:start position:0%
able to leave my house if he's outside
 
00:45:24.950 --> 00:45:24.960 align:start position:0%
and I'm on my property I have to go
 
00:45:28.069 --> 00:45:28.079 align:start position:0%
inside because my house is not 300 ft
 
00:45:32.069 --> 00:45:32.079 align:start position:0%
from his house um he wanted us to take
 
00:45:34.230 --> 00:45:34.240 align:start position:0%
down our surveillance cameras because he
 
00:45:37.589 --> 00:45:37.599 align:start position:0%
says they're shining into his house the
 
00:45:40.309 --> 00:45:40.319 align:start position:0%
um all of the police in town have seen
 
00:45:42.510 --> 00:45:42.520 align:start position:0%
surveillance camera his lawyer has seen
 
00:45:44.670 --> 00:45:44.680 align:start position:0%
surveillance footage from that the
 
00:45:46.750 --> 00:45:46.760 align:start position:0%
parole board has seen surveillance
 
00:45:48.910 --> 00:45:48.920 align:start position:0%
footage from that nobody has said that
 
00:45:51.150 --> 00:45:51.160 align:start position:0%
it's illegal so we have refused to take
 
00:45:53.670 --> 00:45:53.680 align:start position:0%
down the camera and the police have
 
00:45:55.870 --> 00:45:55.880 align:start position:0%
looked at it live and said no you can't
 
00:45:59.589 --> 00:45:59.599 align:start position:0%
can't see in there um so we haven't done
 
00:46:01.510 --> 00:46:01.520 align:start position:0%
that again my husband had to give up all
 
00:46:02.510 --> 00:46:02.520 align:start position:0%
of his
 
00:46:06.069 --> 00:46:06.079 align:start position:0%
guns um and that goes into effect
 
00:46:07.990 --> 00:46:08.000 align:start position:0%
immediately when the police show up at
 
00:46:10.549 --> 00:46:10.559 align:start position:0%
your house and then that stays in effect
 
00:46:13.309 --> 00:46:13.319 align:start position:0%
until you get to the hearing and then
 
00:46:15.069 --> 00:46:15.079 align:start position:0%
the judge decides if it's going to stay
 
00:46:19.829 --> 00:46:19.839 align:start position:0%
in effect for 365 days or not did the
 
00:46:21.589 --> 00:46:21.599 align:start position:0%
judge who signed off on this is he the
 
00:46:23.230 --> 00:46:23.240 align:start position:0%
same one who was sitting on the cases
 
00:46:24.589 --> 00:46:24.599 align:start position:0%
that were dismissed before they were
 
00:46:27.390 --> 00:46:27.400 align:start position:0%
started no that the other problem is
 
00:46:29.549 --> 00:46:29.559 align:start position:0%
that again one hand does not know what
 
00:46:31.549 --> 00:46:31.559 align:start position:0%
the other hand is doing so this is an
 
00:46:35.230 --> 00:46:35.240 align:start position:0%
actual a new judge in the circuit court
 
00:46:39.710 --> 00:46:39.720 align:start position:0%
and um so they probably have no context
 
00:46:41.510 --> 00:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
for what this person is because we have
 
00:46:43.470 --> 00:46:43.480 align:start position:0%
been told by the police you know once
 
00:46:45.510 --> 00:46:45.520 align:start position:0%
this happens a couple of times the judge
 
00:46:47.150 --> 00:46:47.160 align:start position:0%
is going to get wise to it and they
 
00:46:50.150 --> 00:46:50.160 align:start position:0%
won't they won't approve it but again
 
00:46:52.069 --> 00:46:52.079 align:start position:0%
you know there's a new judge now we have
 
00:46:54.790 --> 00:46:54.800 align:start position:0%
to start this all over again okay thank
 
00:46:58.549 --> 00:46:58.559 align:start position:0%
you any questions from the
 
00:47:01.790 --> 00:47:01.800 align:start position:0%
committee yes representative
 
00:47:04.430 --> 00:47:04.440 align:start position:0%
Muse sorry my teach my old teacher came
 
00:47:06.510 --> 00:47:06.520 align:start position:0%
out on me put your hand up I'll call on
 
00:47:09.309 --> 00:47:09.319 align:start position:0%
you thanks for coming in to testify you
 
00:47:12.589 --> 00:47:12.599 align:start position:0%
you you had said that um uh there have
 
00:47:14.349 --> 00:47:14.359 align:start position:0%
been at least one occasion where he's
 
00:47:17.270 --> 00:47:17.280 align:start position:0%
been arrested multiple times on
 
00:47:19.589 --> 00:47:19.599 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor charges in the
 
00:47:24.190 --> 00:47:24.200 align:start position:0%
neighborhood uh um what were the charges
 
00:47:26.270 --> 00:47:26.280 align:start position:0%
and what were the circumstances that
 
00:47:29.870 --> 00:47:29.880 align:start position:0%
were involved in that um most recently
 
00:47:32.109 --> 00:47:32.119 align:start position:0%
and he actually I don't believe has
 
00:47:34.150 --> 00:47:34.160 align:start position:0%
gotten the arrest warrant yet they were
 
00:47:37.790 --> 00:47:37.800 align:start position:0%
working on it him and his wife egged my
 
00:47:37.800 --> 00:47:39.309 align:start position:0%
working on it him and his wife egged my
neighbor's

00:47:39.309 --> 00:47:39.319 align:start position:0%
neighbor's
 
00:47:41.549 --> 00:47:41.559 align:start position:0%
car um which was caught on my
 
00:47:45.470 --> 00:47:45.480 align:start position:0%
surveillance camera he has been um
 
00:47:49.390 --> 00:47:49.400 align:start position:0%
charged with disorderly conduct um
 
00:47:51.870 --> 00:47:51.880 align:start position:0%
destruction of property the last thing
 
00:47:55.790 --> 00:47:55.800 align:start position:0%
that sent him away um because of a par
 
00:48:00.230 --> 00:48:00.240 align:start position:0%
violation was he moved a property pin
 
00:48:02.390 --> 00:48:02.400 align:start position:0%
and it was caught on camera that he
 
00:48:04.510 --> 00:48:04.520 align:start position:0%
moved the pin and and took it completely
 
00:48:06.069 --> 00:48:06.079 align:start position:0%
out of the ground and walked away with
 
00:48:10.230 --> 00:48:10.240 align:start position:0%
it um threatening a lot of threatening
 
00:48:13.230 --> 00:48:13.240 align:start position:0%
but the police as overwhelmed as they
 
00:48:16.109 --> 00:48:16.119 align:start position:0%
are you know it's to their discretion to
 
00:48:18.670 --> 00:48:18.680 align:start position:0%
decide if it's a chargeable offense and
 
00:48:20.790 --> 00:48:20.800 align:start position:0%
it's paperwork and it's a lot of
 
00:48:23.109 --> 00:48:23.119 align:start position:0%
paperwork and it's time that they aren't
 
00:48:26.390 --> 00:48:26.400 align:start position:0%
spending on more important things I
 
00:48:28.309 --> 00:48:28.319 align:start position:0%
understand that in the grand scheme of
 
00:48:32.109 --> 00:48:32.119 align:start position:0%
things my inconvenience as a citizen is
 
00:48:34.510 --> 00:48:34.520 align:start position:0%
not as important as somebody else's
 
00:48:38.430 --> 00:48:38.440 align:start position:0%
trauma um but you know so a lot of the
 
00:48:40.790 --> 00:48:40.800 align:start position:0%
things that
 
00:48:44.630 --> 00:48:44.640 align:start position:0%
we um fill out statements for it it
 
00:48:47.150 --> 00:48:47.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't really go
 
00:48:50.069 --> 00:48:50.079 align:start position:0%
anywhere so but I believe the last time
 
00:48:53.349 --> 00:48:53.359 align:start position:0%
he had a total of 17 charges when he
 
00:48:56.150 --> 00:48:56.160 align:start position:0%
ended up um violating parole and this
 
00:48:58.349 --> 00:48:58.359 align:start position:0%
this was in in in the span of like a
 
00:49:00.190 --> 00:49:00.200 align:start position:0%
couple of months cuz he' come out of
 
00:49:03.270 --> 00:49:03.280 align:start position:0%
parole or out of jail on parole and
 
00:49:05.750 --> 00:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
within a couple of months it was like 17
 
00:49:07.750 --> 00:49:07.760 align:start position:0%
charges could you narrow it down though
 
00:49:09.789 --> 00:49:09.799 align:start position:0%
to the to the times where he was
 
00:49:12.230 --> 00:49:12.240 align:start position:0%
arrested for her misdemeanor and bailed
 
00:49:14.710 --> 00:49:14.720 align:start position:0%
and then rearrested and bailed do you do
 
00:49:16.349 --> 00:49:16.359 align:start position:0%
you have we we don't get that
 
00:49:19.230 --> 00:49:19.240 align:start position:0%
information really um you know we will
 
00:49:22.710 --> 00:49:22.720 align:start position:0%
put in a statement MH and I know there
 
00:49:24.950 --> 00:49:24.960 align:start position:0%
was one time and it's the statute of
 
00:49:27.230 --> 00:49:27.240 align:start position:0%
limitations is probably cleared on this
 
00:49:29.510 --> 00:49:29.520 align:start position:0%
cuz it was early on when they first
 
00:49:32.750 --> 00:49:32.760 align:start position:0%
moved here he had his wife get in the
 
00:49:36.069 --> 00:49:36.079 align:start position:0%
car and drive to the end of our street
 
00:49:37.910 --> 00:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
at a very high rate of speed and again
 
00:49:39.789 --> 00:49:39.799 align:start position:0%
we're at a dead end Street the woman
 
00:49:42.390 --> 00:49:42.400 align:start position:0%
that lives at the end of the street is a
 
00:49:45.230 --> 00:49:45.240 align:start position:0%
single mother with a teenage daughter
 
00:49:48.829 --> 00:49:48.839 align:start position:0%
and he started screaming at her in the
 
00:49:50.910 --> 00:49:50.920 align:start position:0%
driveway that she better sleep with one
 
00:49:52.710 --> 00:49:52.720 align:start position:0%
eye open and that she has to leave her
 
00:49:52.720 --> 00:49:53.710 align:start position:0%
eye open and that she has to leave her
house

00:49:53.710 --> 00:49:53.720 align:start position:0%
house
 
00:49:56.549 --> 00:49:56.559 align:start position:0%
sometime and on his way back down the
 
00:49:58.670 --> 00:49:58.680 align:start position:0%
road our other neighbor had come out to
 
00:50:00.950 --> 00:50:00.960 align:start position:0%
see if he had to go up and help our
 
00:50:05.069 --> 00:50:05.079 align:start position:0%
neighbor at all and as he's coming down
 
00:50:06.950 --> 00:50:06.960 align:start position:0%
the street in the car his wife is
 
00:50:08.670 --> 00:50:08.680 align:start position:0%
driving he's got the door open he's
 
00:50:11.470 --> 00:50:11.480 align:start position:0%
screaming run him over hit him run him
 
00:50:14.670 --> 00:50:14.680 align:start position:0%
over hit him as they're coming down the
 
00:50:17.870 --> 00:50:17.880 align:start position:0%
street um he was he did get charged with
 
00:50:20.030 --> 00:50:20.040 align:start position:0%
that but I I do not

01:29:02.590 --> 01:29:02.600 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:29:04.870 --> 01:29:04.880 align:start position:0%
appointment and that's what we're going
 
01:29:07.430 --> 01:29:07.440 align:start position:0%
to do with regard to the bail
 
01:29:09.550 --> 01:29:09.560 align:start position:0%
Commissioners and now that's open for
 
01:29:11.430 --> 01:29:11.440 align:start position:0%
discussion anybody have any questions or
 
01:29:13.070 --> 01:29:13.080 align:start position:0%
points on the
 
01:29:16.390 --> 01:29:16.400 align:start position:0%
committee everyone representative Reed
 
01:29:18.390 --> 01:29:18.400 align:start position:0%
thank you um what about the access to
 
01:29:20.830 --> 01:29:20.840 align:start position:0%
the computer system will they um
 
01:29:23.030 --> 01:29:23.040 align:start position:0%
eventually be able to um access
 
01:29:26.470 --> 01:29:26.480 align:start position:0%
information on the yeah Network we're
 
01:29:29.030 --> 01:29:29.040 align:start position:0%
going to uh I'm in talking to the
 
01:29:31.149 --> 01:29:31.159 align:start position:0%
representatives from the court now about
 
01:29:33.590 --> 01:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
how that would work um I don't know that
 
01:29:35.470 --> 01:29:35.480 align:start position:0%
we're ready to put it in statute right
 
01:29:36.950 --> 01:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
now because I don't think that the
 
01:29:39.669 --> 01:29:39.679 align:start position:0%
infrastructure is quite there yet we are
 
01:29:41.950 --> 01:29:41.960 align:start position:0%
going to address what we addressed last
 
01:29:43.830 --> 01:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
year with getting the money for the
 
01:29:45.590 --> 01:29:45.600 align:start position:0%
police departments to be able to access
 
01:29:47.750 --> 01:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
it so at the very least they'll be able
 
01:29:49.430 --> 01:29:49.440 align:start position:0%
to show the bail commissioner the
 
01:29:52.790 --> 01:29:52.800 align:start position:0%
records there so the the the key part of
 
01:29:54.270 --> 01:29:54.280 align:start position:0%
that is informing a bail commissioner if
 
01:29:55.669 --> 01:29:55.679 align:start position:0%
somebody's already out on bail when they
 
01:29:57.430 --> 01:29:57.440 align:start position:0%
come to bail them so that they can make
 
01:29:59.390 --> 01:29:59.400 align:start position:0%
an informed decision and we're going to
 
01:30:02.550 --> 01:30:02.560 align:start position:0%
address that by at least in the in the
 
01:30:04.870 --> 01:30:04.880 align:start position:0%
short term by ensuring the police have
 
01:30:06.830 --> 01:30:06.840 align:start position:0%
access to all that information so I'm
 
01:30:08.229 --> 01:30:08.239 align:start position:0%
still trying to figure that out with the
 
01:30:09.950 --> 01:30:09.960 align:start position:0%
court but we are going to address it
 
01:30:11.990 --> 01:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
this um representative rhods then
 
01:30:13.790 --> 01:30:13.800 align:start position:0%
representative wheeler thank you Mr
 
01:30:16.870 --> 01:30:16.880 align:start position:0%
chairman um the one thing that I just
 
01:30:18.709 --> 01:30:18.719 align:start position:0%
wanted to bring up was you know we heard
 
01:30:20.709 --> 01:30:20.719 align:start position:0%
so much about training of the bill
 
01:30:23.950 --> 01:30:23.960 align:start position:0%
Commissioners and and going through my
 
01:30:26.870 --> 01:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
handy dandy little
 
01:30:29.070 --> 01:30:29.080 align:start position:0%
notebook um it's interesting because
 
01:30:31.910 --> 01:30:31.920 align:start position:0%
there actually is I think a three-page
 
01:30:34.430 --> 01:30:34.440 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry a three paragraph section
 
01:30:36.350 --> 01:30:36.360 align:start position:0%
where it is already a law that the bill
 
01:30:37.750 --> 01:30:37.760 align:start position:0%
commissioner is supposed to get paid but
 
01:30:39.350 --> 01:30:39.360 align:start position:0%
somewhere along the way it appears that
 
01:30:42.310 --> 01:30:42.320 align:start position:0%
has just been completely disregarded so
 
01:30:44.270 --> 01:30:44.280 align:start position:0%
the we're not actually changing anything
 
01:30:47.470 --> 01:30:47.480 align:start position:0%
we're just adding to that about um
 
01:30:50.550 --> 01:30:50.560 align:start position:0%
minimum hours and and so forth you mean
 
01:30:52.550 --> 01:30:52.560 align:start position:0%
trained that is exactly what I meant
 
01:30:55.790 --> 01:30:55.800 align:start position:0%
thank you um so you know if you guys are
 
01:30:57.310 --> 01:30:57.320 align:start position:0%
looking in there and you see that you
 
01:30:58.990 --> 01:30:59.000 align:start position:0%
may be as surprised as we were to see
 
01:31:01.590 --> 01:31:01.600 align:start position:0%
that it already is a law um but we just
 
01:31:02.790 --> 01:31:02.800 align:start position:0%
you know tweak a little bit of it we
 
01:31:04.669 --> 01:31:04.679 align:start position:0%
didn't take anything out of that and
 
01:31:08.830 --> 01:31:08.840 align:start position:0%
also we are going to add um that the uh
 
01:31:11.669 --> 01:31:11.679 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court um chief justice or
 
01:31:13.790 --> 01:31:13.800 align:start position:0%
whoever their designate is reports
 
01:31:15.950 --> 01:31:15.960 align:start position:0%
annually to the president of the Senate
 
01:31:18.990 --> 01:31:19.000 align:start position:0%
and the speaker of the house um on the
 
01:31:21.470 --> 01:31:21.480 align:start position:0%
status of the bill Commissioners with
 
01:31:23.510 --> 01:31:23.520 align:start position:0%
regard to how many there are their
 
01:31:27.189 --> 01:31:27.199 align:start position:0%
annual training is um complied with Etc
 
01:31:29.590 --> 01:31:29.600 align:start position:0%
so that um in the legislature We Have
 
01:31:31.470 --> 01:31:31.480 align:start position:0%
Eyes on at least what's going on in the
 
01:31:32.990 --> 01:31:33.000 align:start position:0%
status of all the bail Commissioners in
 
01:31:36.149 --> 01:31:36.159 align:start position:0%
the state does everyone agree with that
 
01:31:38.790 --> 01:31:38.800 align:start position:0%
yes we also added Judiciary and criminal
 
01:31:40.790 --> 01:31:40.800 align:start position:0%
justice committee as well yeah we we
 
01:31:42.910 --> 01:31:42.920 align:start position:0%
were going to add the um Judiciary
 
01:31:44.790 --> 01:31:44.800 align:start position:0%
criminal justice committee and the
 
01:31:46.590 --> 01:31:46.600 align:start position:0%
equivalent in the Senate as well as the
 
01:31:49.229 --> 01:31:49.239 align:start position:0%
president and the uh the
 
01:31:52.470 --> 01:31:52.480 align:start position:0%
speaker um and and I think that about
 
01:31:54.830 --> 01:31:54.840 align:start position:0%
covers it um any further represent
 
01:31:56.510 --> 01:31:56.520 align:start position:0%
wheeler sorry the only thing I wanted to
 
01:31:58.189 --> 01:31:58.199 align:start position:0%
uplift Mr chairman is that we heard a
 
01:31:59.750 --> 01:31:59.760 align:start position:0%
lot from the bail Commissioners that
 
01:32:01.790 --> 01:32:01.800 align:start position:0%
came to testify that there was a lack of
 
01:32:03.669 --> 01:32:03.679 align:start position:0%
standardization in the system when it
 
01:32:05.030 --> 01:32:05.040 align:start position:0%
came to the bail Commissioners and I
 
01:32:07.030 --> 01:32:07.040 align:start position:0%
think that are adding the eight hours of
 
01:32:08.990 --> 01:32:09.000 align:start position:0%
annual training for them to be able to
 
01:32:10.390 --> 01:32:10.400 align:start position:0%
look at the statutes and look through it
 
01:32:11.669 --> 01:32:11.679 align:start position:0%
will actually really help in
 
01:32:13.270 --> 01:32:13.280 align:start position:0%
standardizing the system and making it
 
01:32:16.470 --> 01:32:16.480 align:start position:0%
so that no one's getting out uh based on
 
01:32:19.390 --> 01:32:19.400 align:start position:0%
a statute that is in the law and should
 
01:32:22.270 --> 01:32:22.280 align:start position:0%
be keeping them in yeah uh and that's a
 
01:32:24.550 --> 01:32:24.560 align:start position:0%
good point I think that often when we do
 
01:32:27.270 --> 01:32:27.280 align:start position:0%
laws we have to um we have to write to
 
01:32:29.790 --> 01:32:29.800 align:start position:0%
the lowest common denominator and we
 
01:32:31.910 --> 01:32:31.920 align:start position:0%
know that some courts and some bail
 
01:32:33.790 --> 01:32:33.800 align:start position:0%
Commissioners um they have excellent
 
01:32:35.910 --> 01:32:35.920 align:start position:0%
programs the judges have excellent
 
01:32:38.990 --> 01:32:39.000 align:start position:0%
training um and some from our testimony
 
01:32:41.790 --> 01:32:41.800 align:start position:0%
we heard it's kind of the Wild West so
 
01:32:44.470 --> 01:32:44.480 align:start position:0%
we have to write for the wild west and
 
01:32:46.590 --> 01:32:46.600 align:start position:0%
um so um some bail Commissioners may
 
01:32:49.910 --> 01:32:49.920 align:start position:0%
feel this isn't necessary but others do
 
01:32:51.149 --> 01:32:51.159 align:start position:0%
so we we're going to make sure that
 
01:32:52.669 --> 01:32:52.679 align:start position:0%
everyone gets gets it at least
 
01:32:52.679 --> 01:32:53.750 align:start position:0%
everyone gets gets it at least
representative

01:32:53.750 --> 01:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:32:56.790 --> 01:32:56.800 align:start position:0%
cther um did you mention that um any Law
 
01:33:00.070 --> 01:33:00.080 align:start position:0%
changes during the year oh yeah also um
 
01:33:02.950 --> 01:33:02.960 align:start position:0%
my notes are lacking in that um training
 
01:33:06.310 --> 01:33:06.320 align:start position:0%
it would say eight hours um annually 16
 
01:33:09.870 --> 01:33:09.880 align:start position:0%
initial and any changes to the law
 
01:33:13.390 --> 01:33:13.400 align:start position:0%
occurring during the year that are
 
01:33:15.790 --> 01:33:15.800 align:start position:0%
driven by a court decision or new action
 
01:33:18.629 --> 01:33:18.639 align:start position:0%
of the legislature so for example if
 
01:33:20.070 --> 01:33:20.080 align:start position:0%
they just had their eight hours of
 
01:33:22.870 --> 01:33:22.880 align:start position:0%
training uh two month later a court
 
01:33:24.310 --> 01:33:24.320 align:start position:0%
decision comes down from the Supreme
 
01:33:26.629 --> 01:33:26.639 align:start position:0%
Court addressing bail they would have to
 
01:33:29.310 --> 01:33:29.320 align:start position:0%
be called back and retrained on that um
 
01:33:30.669 --> 01:33:30.679 align:start position:0%
but I don't I don't know that we're
 
01:33:32.270 --> 01:33:32.280 align:start position:0%
going to put in statute that it has to
 
01:33:34.350 --> 01:33:34.360 align:start position:0%
be inperson physical for an update like
 
01:33:36.550 --> 01:33:36.560 align:start position:0%
that it could just be that the whoever's
 
01:33:38.830 --> 01:33:38.840 align:start position:0%
in charge we just have to put in in that
 
01:33:41.189 --> 01:33:41.199 align:start position:0%
they will be trained on any updates
 
01:33:42.390 --> 01:33:42.400 align:start position:0%
because I don't want to put that burden
 
01:33:44.430 --> 01:33:44.440 align:start position:0%
on the court or the um magistrates to
 
01:33:45.870 --> 01:33:45.880 align:start position:0%
have to go in again just to hear about
 
01:33:45.880 --> 01:33:47.870 align:start position:0%
have to go in again just to hear about
one

01:33:47.870 --> 01:33:47.880 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:33:50.750 --> 01:33:50.760 align:start position:0%
case but we will mandate that they they
 
01:33:52.390 --> 01:33:52.400 align:start position:0%
do be trained on
 
01:33:54.390 --> 01:33:54.400 align:start position:0%
it represent
 
01:33:58.310 --> 01:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
Muse yeah just a just a couple of things
 
01:34:00.669 --> 01:34:00.679 align:start position:0%
um one of the things that we've done for
 
01:34:03.510 --> 01:34:03.520 align:start position:0%
workers and other situations where you
 
01:34:06.590 --> 01:34:06.600 align:start position:0%
know retention is an issue not not just
 
01:34:09.750 --> 01:34:09.760 align:start position:0%
attraction um is set things set it up so
 
01:34:12.470 --> 01:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
that uh uh people can receive retention
 
01:34:14.390 --> 01:34:14.400 align:start position:0%
bonuses or Rewards or something like
 
01:34:15.830 --> 01:34:15.840 align:start position:0%
that it would be nice to see something
 
01:34:23.229 --> 01:34:23.239 align:start position:0%
like that uh included in here um another
 
01:34:27.550 --> 01:34:27.560 align:start position:0%
another issue is um who actually
 
01:34:29.910 --> 01:34:29.920 align:start position:0%
oversees this you know and and I think
 
01:34:32.950 --> 01:34:32.960 align:start position:0%
it's something that we raised uh earlier
 
01:34:34.990 --> 01:34:35.000 align:start position:0%
uh perhaps creating a part-time position
 
01:34:36.470 --> 01:34:36.480 align:start position:0%
in I think I have an answer for you
 
01:34:39.470 --> 01:34:39.480 align:start position:0%
before we get too further um we we are
 
01:34:41.109 --> 01:34:41.119 align:start position:0%
discussions right now representative
 
01:34:43.950 --> 01:34:43.960 align:start position:0%
gaite and I with the um with the courts
 
01:34:47.870 --> 01:34:47.880 align:start position:0%
and we are looking at um potential for
 
01:34:51.189 --> 01:34:51.199 align:start position:0%
actually bringing in magistrates to um
 
01:34:52.790 --> 01:34:52.800 align:start position:0%
in I don't want to get too far Mye of
 
01:34:54.070 --> 01:34:54.080 align:start position:0%
myself because this is a separate
 
01:34:55.629 --> 01:34:55.639 align:start position:0%
statute we're going to be dealing with
 
01:34:58.270 --> 01:34:58.280 align:start position:0%
in the next couple days um that would
 
01:35:00.470 --> 01:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
oversee bail Commissioners within their
 
01:35:02.149 --> 01:35:02.159 align:start position:0%
region in other words we're not
 
01:35:03.830 --> 01:35:03.840 align:start position:0%
replacing bail Commissioners we're going
 
01:35:06.270 --> 01:35:06.280 align:start position:0%
to be adding a position um that's going
 
01:35:08.109 --> 01:35:08.119 align:start position:0%
to have certain other duties um but they
 
01:35:09.709 --> 01:35:09.719 align:start position:0%
would be in charge that way you don't
 
01:35:11.590 --> 01:35:11.600 align:start position:0%
have one person trying to oversee all of
 
01:35:14.390 --> 01:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
them in the state each geographic region
 
01:35:15.950 --> 01:35:15.960 align:start position:0%
will know how many bail Commissioners
 
01:35:17.709 --> 01:35:17.719 align:start position:0%
they have in their region they'll be
 
01:35:19.350 --> 01:35:19.360 align:start position:0%
responsible for training they'll bear
 
01:35:20.790 --> 01:35:20.800 align:start position:0%
and Reporting back to the court that
 
01:35:23.070 --> 01:35:23.080 align:start position:0%
they have complied with the training Etc
 
01:35:24.310 --> 01:35:24.320 align:start position:0%
so we're going to make sure there's a
 
01:35:27.189 --> 01:35:27.199 align:start position:0%
chain of answerability as far as that
 
01:35:29.229 --> 01:35:29.239 align:start position:0%
goes but I I don't want to get too far
 
01:35:33.030 --> 01:35:33.040 align:start position:0%
ahead of that yet just follow um one of
 
01:35:34.510 --> 01:35:34.520 align:start position:0%
the bills that we've retained that's in
 
01:35:36.830 --> 01:35:36.840 align:start position:0%
front of us is HB 318 which would
 
01:35:39.149 --> 01:35:39.159 align:start position:0%
actually eliminate Bill Commissioners
 
01:35:40.430 --> 01:35:40.440 align:start position:0%
one of the things we might want to
 
01:35:42.350 --> 01:35:42.360 align:start position:0%
consider doing is just quickly executing
 
01:35:44.030 --> 01:35:44.040 align:start position:0%
that um no we're using that as the
 
01:35:46.030 --> 01:35:46.040 align:start position:0%
vehicle for we're using that yeah yeah
 
01:35:49.030 --> 01:35:49.040 align:start position:0%
we're GNA we're going to um amend that
 
01:35:51.629 --> 01:35:51.639 align:start position:0%
and since it's fairly Germaine um we're
 
01:35:53.950 --> 01:35:53.960 align:start position:0%
going to just go ahead and change it um
 
01:35:56.669 --> 01:35:56.679 align:start position:0%
representative Stone thank you Mr chair
 
01:35:58.189 --> 01:35:58.199 align:start position:0%
I'd like to say that uh the bill
 
01:35:59.550 --> 01:35:59.560 align:start position:0%
commissioner system that we currently
 
01:36:01.590 --> 01:36:01.600 align:start position:0%
use uh shouldn't never have been thought
 
01:36:03.310 --> 01:36:03.320 align:start position:0%
of to be abandoned I think these
 
01:36:05.390 --> 01:36:05.400 align:start position:0%
compromises operationally will put us
 
01:36:07.109 --> 01:36:07.119 align:start position:0%
back on track where we should be and I
 
01:36:08.229 --> 01:36:08.239 align:start position:0%
think the bill Commissioners that we
 
01:36:10.189 --> 01:36:10.199 align:start position:0%
currently have have really endured a lot
 
01:36:13.030 --> 01:36:13.040 align:start position:0%
over the last uh decade or so of serving
 
01:36:14.750 --> 01:36:14.760 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers of New Hampshire very
 
01:36:17.870 --> 01:36:17.880 align:start position:0%
fiscally and I support all these changes
 
01:36:19.590 --> 01:36:19.600 align:start position:0%
thank you uh represent Stone I I agree
 
01:36:22.430 --> 01:36:22.440 align:start position:0%
totally I think that the system as it is
 
01:36:23.910 --> 01:36:23.920 align:start position:0%
um would crumble without the bail
 
01:36:26.430 --> 01:36:26.440 align:start position:0%
Commissioners um they're intricate um
 
01:36:29.550 --> 01:36:29.560 align:start position:0%
and necessary part and um as far as as
 
01:36:31.669 --> 01:36:31.679 align:start position:0%
long as I'm here we won't be considering
 
01:36:34.790 --> 01:36:34.800 align:start position:0%
uh getting rid of them at all um but we
 
01:36:37.350 --> 01:36:37.360 align:start position:0%
will we will make sure that they finally
 
01:36:39.510 --> 01:36:39.520 align:start position:0%
get paid and we will make sure that
 
01:36:41.430 --> 01:36:41.440 align:start position:0%
there is consistent training across the
 
01:36:44.270 --> 01:36:44.280 align:start position:0%
board for all of them um did you raise
 
01:36:49.070 --> 01:36:49.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:50.910 --> 01:36:50.920 align:start position:0%
representative so as you're not going to
 
01:36:53.070 --> 01:36:53.080 align:start position:0%
shoot down our ideas otherwise you're
 
01:36:55.590 --> 01:36:55.600 align:start position:0%
going to have to wait so it's you can
 
01:36:57.750 --> 01:36:57.760 align:start position:0%
nibble go ahead
 
01:37:02.310 --> 01:37:02.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:05.910 --> 01:37:05.920 align:start position:0%
away time to nibble yes okay thank you
 
01:37:09.550 --> 01:37:09.560 align:start position:0%
um you asked about uh day-to-day
 
01:37:12.270 --> 01:37:12.280 align:start position:0%
supervision of bail Commissioners fine
 
01:37:14.830 --> 01:37:14.840 align:start position:0%
if you want magistrates but the de facto
 
01:37:16.430 --> 01:37:16.440 align:start position:0%
the way that's done it's the clerk of
 
01:37:20.030 --> 01:37:20.040 align:start position:0%
the court does that Y and I am routinely
 
01:37:23.750 --> 01:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
spanked for a form that's not right or I
 
01:37:26.910 --> 01:37:26.920 align:start position:0%
didn't use it's never really a judgment
 
01:37:29.990 --> 01:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
call uh it's that's really not it's Mo
 
01:37:31.709 --> 01:37:31.719 align:start position:0%
mostly a
 
01:37:34.109 --> 01:37:34.119 align:start position:0%
technical uh
 
01:37:36.870 --> 01:37:36.880 align:start position:0%
issue um I am
 
01:37:41.030 --> 01:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
not supporter of increasing the pay what
 
01:37:46.589 --> 01:37:46.599 align:start position:0%
I am a big fan of is getting the them
 
01:37:48.870 --> 01:37:48.880 align:start position:0%
paid I don't think the that their
 
01:37:51.350 --> 01:37:51.360 align:start position:0%
complaint is whether it's 40 or 50 the
 
01:37:54.390 --> 01:37:54.400 align:start position:0%
complaint is that they're not paid so
 
01:37:59.149 --> 01:37:59.159 align:start position:0%
that I think we may be overreaching and
 
01:38:03.910 --> 01:38:03.920 align:start position:0%
I'm that's that's a a nibble another
 
01:38:06.629 --> 01:38:06.639 align:start position:0%
perhaps nibble that is a more much more
 
01:38:08.830 --> 01:38:08.840 align:start position:0%
personal one and this this whether I was
 
01:38:12.589 --> 01:38:12.599 align:start position:0%
on Edna or here I do not like fixed
 
01:38:15.390 --> 01:38:15.400 align:start position:0%
hours we're going to come eight hours a
 
01:38:17.229 --> 01:38:17.239 align:start position:0%
year and what are we going to do I'd
 
01:38:20.350 --> 01:38:20.360 align:start position:0%
like to ask for input from the court
 
01:38:21.629 --> 01:38:21.639 align:start position:0%
what they think
 
01:38:24.589 --> 01:38:24.599 align:start position:0%
before we fix before we carve this in
 
01:38:28.550 --> 01:38:28.560 align:start position:0%
stone is 16 the right number of hours
 
01:38:31.430 --> 01:38:31.440 align:start position:0%
for the initial I don't really too worry
 
01:38:32.830 --> 01:38:32.840 align:start position:0%
too much about the
 
01:38:36.589 --> 01:38:36.599 align:start position:0%
initial I I like the court to to to to
 
01:38:39.430 --> 01:38:39.440 align:start position:0%
pass on that before we say it I'd like
 
01:38:42.430 --> 01:38:42.440 align:start position:0%
to see something like a minimum of four
 
01:38:46.870 --> 01:38:46.880 align:start position:0%
a minimum of four hours and for uh
 
01:38:49.950 --> 01:38:49.960 align:start position:0%
yearly allow me just to interrupt um
 
01:38:52.629 --> 01:38:52.639 align:start position:0%
because uh I I it it's my fault for not
 
01:38:55.830 --> 01:38:55.840 align:start position:0%
saying it first this um structure was
 
01:38:58.390 --> 01:38:58.400 align:start position:0%
come up came up with in conjunction with
 
01:39:01.070 --> 01:39:01.080 align:start position:0%
the court speaking with um uh the
 
01:39:03.870 --> 01:39:03.880 align:start position:0%
Court's representative Aaron um I forgot
 
01:39:07.189 --> 01:39:07.199 align:start position:0%
her name pardon me um the hours the the
 
01:39:08.830 --> 01:39:08.840 align:start position:0%
money the training all of it was in
 
01:39:11.589 --> 01:39:11.599 align:start position:0%
conjunction talking with the courts so
 
01:39:13.189 --> 01:39:13.199 align:start position:0%
oh all
 
01:39:17.510 --> 01:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
right uh no vacuums but um uh I agree
 
01:39:22.550 --> 01:39:22.560 align:start position:0%
though 16 we in discussion um there may
 
01:39:24.870 --> 01:39:24.880 align:start position:0%
not be 16 well 16 there's certainly
 
01:39:26.589 --> 01:39:26.599 align:start position:0%
enough uh two days training for a new
 
01:39:28.950 --> 01:39:28.960 align:start position:0%
bill commissioner the 8 hours and they
 
01:39:30.709 --> 01:39:30.719 align:start position:0%
can use it to Shadow they can use it
 
01:39:33.149 --> 01:39:33.159 align:start position:0%
however they want also the the eight
 
01:39:35.350 --> 01:39:35.360 align:start position:0%
hours annually even if there's only four
 
01:39:37.910 --> 01:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
hours worth of talking um I think
 
01:39:39.310 --> 01:39:39.320 align:start position:0%
getting the bill Commissioners together
 
01:39:40.790 --> 01:39:40.800 align:start position:0%
for a couple hours from the various
 
01:39:43.149 --> 01:39:43.159 align:start position:0%
regions to talk to each other share best
 
01:39:45.109 --> 01:39:45.119 align:start position:0%
practices I I don't think anything bad
 
01:39:47.229 --> 01:39:47.239 align:start position:0%
can come from them actually getting
 
01:39:48.589 --> 01:39:48.599 align:start position:0%
together and seeing each
 
01:39:52.189 --> 01:39:52.199 align:start position:0%
other I I just want that to be a serious
 
01:39:54.709 --> 01:39:54.719 align:start position:0%
thing because you if you have two hours
 
01:39:56.790 --> 01:39:56.800 align:start position:0%
of talk and four hours to fill now
 
01:39:59.510 --> 01:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
you're maybe trivializing the thing I
 
01:40:01.790 --> 01:40:01.800 align:start position:0%
agree and that that that's really what's
 
01:40:03.990 --> 01:40:04.000 align:start position:0%
at the bottom of my concern I want that
 
01:40:07.189 --> 01:40:07.199 align:start position:0%
to be meaty time in fact the 16 hours if
 
01:40:10.390 --> 01:40:10.400 align:start position:0%
that's going to include laboratory time
 
01:40:12.629 --> 01:40:12.639 align:start position:0%
I know the last the bail commissioner I
 
01:40:14.189 --> 01:40:14.199 align:start position:0%
trained actually he's probably better
 
01:40:16.870 --> 01:40:16.880 align:start position:0%
than he's very good one he came with me
 
01:40:19.870 --> 01:40:19.880 align:start position:0%
and it I'm talking 20 hours I me he was
 
01:40:22.470 --> 01:40:22.480 align:start position:0%
with me for
 
01:40:24.790 --> 01:40:24.800 align:start position:0%
many bales that I'm talking about I
 
01:40:26.629 --> 01:40:26.639 align:start position:0%
couldn't wake him he didn't mind being
 
01:40:30.709 --> 01:40:30.719 align:start position:0%
wake or he never admitted uh objecting
 
01:40:34.910 --> 01:40:34.920 align:start position:0%
to be awakened at night one final note I
 
01:40:36.629 --> 01:40:36.639 align:start position:0%
all right my nibbles aren't you're
 
01:40:38.790 --> 01:40:38.800 align:start position:0%
you're defanging me and I don't like it
 
01:40:41.589 --> 01:40:41.599 align:start position:0%
but anyway um I do everything in
 
01:40:44.589 --> 01:40:44.599 align:start position:0%
anticipation of your bites the um we
 
01:40:46.910 --> 01:40:46.920 align:start position:0%
just had our bail commissioner's meeting
 
01:40:49.669 --> 01:40:49.679 align:start position:0%
and I'm a little put out at it we had
 
01:40:53.950 --> 01:40:53.960 align:start position:0%
two judges one was wanted to be engaged
 
01:40:56.109 --> 01:40:56.119 align:start position:0%
and involved the
 
01:40:58.470 --> 01:40:58.480 align:start position:0%
other uh it was his birthday he wanted
 
01:41:01.270 --> 01:41:01.280 align:start position:0%
to get out of there he was not welcoming
 
01:41:04.510 --> 01:41:04.520 align:start position:0%
it questions that I had and I said you
 
01:41:05.950 --> 01:41:05.960 align:start position:0%
might like to hear what's going on with
 
01:41:07.629 --> 01:41:07.639 align:start position:0%
the criminal justice committee nope if
 
01:41:09.950 --> 01:41:09.960 align:start position:0%
it's not an RSA I don't want to hear
 
01:41:13.430 --> 01:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
it what that's that's the at that was
 
01:41:16.629 --> 01:41:16.639 align:start position:0%
the attitude of a judge I you'd think
 
01:41:19.390 --> 01:41:19.400 align:start position:0%
that he would want to know what's what's
 
01:41:21.589 --> 01:41:21.599 align:start position:0%
rustling what's happening
 
01:41:24.430 --> 01:41:24.440 align:start position:0%
he he I was I I don't want to my
 
01:41:26.109 --> 01:41:26.119 align:start position:0%
feelings were hurt but they were a
 
01:41:28.470 --> 01:41:28.480 align:start position:0%
little hurt yeah well certainly
 
01:41:30.550 --> 01:41:30.560 align:start position:0%
disrespectful I then yeah it it just
 
01:41:34.629 --> 01:41:34.639 align:start position:0%
wasn't anyway a little glimpse
 
01:41:38.629 --> 01:41:38.639 align:start position:0%
into my my world of about two weeks ago
 
01:41:40.390 --> 01:41:40.400 align:start position:0%
anyway thank you for listening and thank
 
01:41:43.430 --> 01:41:43.440 align:start position:0%
you for sharing um represent wheeler and
 
01:41:44.830 --> 01:41:44.840 align:start position:0%
then represent
 
01:41:47.709 --> 01:41:47.719 align:start position:0%
me I mean excuse me wayer represent
 
01:41:52.109 --> 01:41:52.119 align:start position:0%
Stone thank you Mr I muffins in my mind
 
01:41:55.229 --> 01:41:55.239 align:start position:0%
yes uh thank you Mr chair the hairs in
 
01:41:56.589 --> 01:41:56.599 align:start position:0%
regards to the hours I think the hours
 
01:41:58.589 --> 01:41:58.599 align:start position:0%
are okay being allotted and I certainly
 
01:42:00.910 --> 01:42:00.920 align:start position:0%
don't want to see anything micromanaged
 
01:42:03.229 --> 01:42:03.239 align:start position:0%
the Judiciary and that I have a feeling
 
01:42:04.910 --> 01:42:04.920 align:start position:0%
they can be responsible enough to
 
01:42:06.109 --> 01:42:06.119 align:start position:0%
dictate the hours of how they want to
 
01:42:07.629 --> 01:42:07.639 align:start position:0%
break them down within that year for
 
01:42:09.669 --> 01:42:09.679 align:start position:0%
training yeah and I I think
 
01:42:13.270 --> 01:42:13.280 align:start position:0%
representative um scitec um suggestion
 
01:42:16.030 --> 01:42:16.040 align:start position:0%
is actually very um good that we we put
 
01:42:18.229 --> 01:42:18.239 align:start position:0%
in there uh that at least some of that
 
01:42:21.830 --> 01:42:21.840 align:start position:0%
should be used to Shadow on on baales
 
01:42:24.310 --> 01:42:24.320 align:start position:0%
because that uh hearing about it in the
 
01:42:26.310 --> 01:42:26.320 align:start position:0%
class versus actually getting out there
 
01:42:28.270 --> 01:42:28.280 align:start position:0%
in the field and seeing it is is totally
 
01:42:29.950 --> 01:42:29.960 align:start position:0%
different experience so I I think that
 
01:42:32.149 --> 01:42:32.159 align:start position:0%
is important and we will take that under
 
01:42:33.910 --> 01:42:33.920 align:start position:0%
enisman as we draft this uh
 
01:42:33.920 --> 01:42:35.149 align:start position:0%
enisman as we draft this uh
representative

01:42:35.149 --> 01:42:35.159 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:42:39.149 --> 01:42:39.159 align:start position:0%
Muse yeah one one one hopefully minor
 
01:42:42.270 --> 01:42:42.280 align:start position:0%
issue that I hope we can address is um
 
01:42:45.350 --> 01:42:45.360 align:start position:0%
allowing the court to collect regardless
 
01:42:48.189 --> 01:42:48.199 align:start position:0%
of indigency for up to two years kind of
 
01:42:52.270 --> 01:42:52.280 align:start position:0%
fires our torpedo into the whole concept
 
01:42:55.830 --> 01:42:55.840 align:start position:0%
of indig indigency it's you know people
 
01:43:00.189 --> 01:43:00.199 align:start position:0%
basically can't pay um and as a
 
01:43:02.669 --> 01:43:02.679 align:start position:0%
practical matter when we're talking $40
 
01:43:05.990 --> 01:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
or $50 chasing people for two years to
 
01:43:09.550 --> 01:43:09.560 align:start position:0%
pay 40 or $50 doesn't might not be the
 
01:43:11.510 --> 01:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
most efficient use of the Court system's
 
01:43:13.149 --> 01:43:13.159 align:start position:0%
time that's why I think that we're going
 
01:43:14.910 --> 01:43:14.920 align:start position:0%
to leave it up to them to decide if they
 
01:43:16.950 --> 01:43:16.960 align:start position:0%
want to pursue that but if you start
 
01:43:19.189 --> 01:43:19.199 align:start position:0%
talking about you know four five 600
 
01:43:23.629 --> 01:43:23.639 align:start position:0%
defendants with $ in per year it adds up
 
01:43:25.030 --> 01:43:25.040 align:start position:0%
to significant amount of money that
 
01:43:26.790 --> 01:43:26.800 align:start position:0%
would be coming out of their budget but
 
01:43:29.030 --> 01:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
we will leave it up to them to say we
 
01:43:31.070 --> 01:43:31.080 align:start position:0%
will say if they're Indigent the court
 
01:43:34.070 --> 01:43:34.080 align:start position:0%
May wave um I mean I I don't want
 
01:43:36.030 --> 01:43:36.040 align:start position:0%
because someone may be Indigent today
 
01:43:37.669 --> 01:43:37.679 align:start position:0%
and get a job six months from now and
 
01:43:39.310 --> 01:43:39.320 align:start position:0%
they could pay that $50 if they are the
 
01:43:41.189 --> 01:43:41.199 align:start position:0%
stay so that's why I'm leaving it up to
 
01:43:42.510 --> 01:43:42.520 align:start position:0%
the court and the two years was just the
 
01:43:44.229 --> 01:43:44.239 align:start position:0%
number I picked that we don't have to
 
01:43:46.430 --> 01:43:46.440 align:start position:0%
put any time liit they you know I just I
 
01:43:47.669 --> 01:43:47.679 align:start position:0%
want to leave it with them with the
 
01:43:50.189 --> 01:43:50.199 align:start position:0%
ability to decide this person can now
 
01:43:53.430 --> 01:43:53.440 align:start position:0%
pay or they just can't and for us to do
 
01:43:56.589 --> 01:43:56.599 align:start position:0%
it from here we could be hurting uh
 
01:43:58.709 --> 01:43:58.719 align:start position:0%
their budget and our budget because
 
01:44:00.830 --> 01:44:00.840 align:start position:0%
someone could have a job six weeks later
 
01:44:04.510 --> 01:44:04.520 align:start position:0%
and easily pay the $50 and it was waved
 
01:44:06.030 --> 01:44:06.040 align:start position:0%
six months ago and now they're off the
 
01:44:08.270 --> 01:44:08.280 align:start position:0%
hook on it and the taxpayers have to
 
01:44:10.030 --> 01:44:10.040 align:start position:0%
pick it up so I I feel like if we leave
 
01:44:11.629 --> 01:44:11.639 align:start position:0%
the court the the room to make the
 
01:44:13.669 --> 01:44:13.679 align:start position:0%
decision I trust that they'll make the
 
01:44:15.669 --> 01:44:15.679 align:start position:0%
right decision um as to whether or not
 
01:44:17.510 --> 01:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
someone's you know you get someone
 
01:44:19.629 --> 01:44:19.639 align:start position:0%
homeless who who has mental health
 
01:44:21.870 --> 01:44:21.880 align:start position:0%
issues they're never going to get $50
 
01:44:23.589 --> 01:44:23.599 align:start position:0%
and I'm hoping the court will be wise
 
01:44:25.870 --> 01:44:25.880 align:start position:0%
enough to see that and not pursue it um
 
01:44:28.430 --> 01:44:28.440 align:start position:0%
so if we leave in there the court May
 
01:44:31.950 --> 01:44:31.960 align:start position:0%
wave um when a defendant is found
 
01:44:31.960 --> 01:44:33.830 align:start position:0%
wave um when a defendant is found
Indigent

01:44:33.830 --> 01:44:33.840 align:start position:0%
Indigent
 
01:44:37.470 --> 01:44:37.480 align:start position:0%
or pursue it at a later date I mean but
 
01:44:39.229 --> 01:44:39.239 align:start position:0%
there there's nothing in the changes
 
01:44:42.750 --> 01:44:42.760 align:start position:0%
that we'd be doing that would actually
 
01:44:45.629 --> 01:44:45.639 align:start position:0%
um keep an Indigent person who can
 
01:44:48.189 --> 01:44:48.199 align:start position:0%
afford a baill commissioner um from
 
01:44:49.550 --> 01:44:49.560 align:start position:0%
actually using a baill commissioner oh
 
01:44:52.390 --> 01:44:52.400 align:start position:0%
no no no no they no okay no absolutely
 
01:44:53.910 --> 01:44:53.920 align:start position:0%
not they get the bail commit all that's
 
01:44:56.790 --> 01:44:56.800 align:start position:0%
taken care of after the F thank you yeah
 
01:44:58.990 --> 01:44:59.000 align:start position:0%
representative um rhods thank you Mr
 
01:45:00.629 --> 01:45:00.639 align:start position:0%
chairman okay
 
01:45:03.510 --> 01:45:03.520 align:start position:0%
so to to representative Muse's question
 
01:45:05.709 --> 01:45:05.719 align:start position:0%
we do have that written out more
 
01:45:08.350 --> 01:45:08.360 align:start position:0%
specifically here yeah um better than I
 
01:45:10.550 --> 01:45:10.560 align:start position:0%
RAM and you know the court is authorized
 
01:45:12.270 --> 01:45:12.280 align:start position:0%
to make the determination whether or not
 
01:45:13.990 --> 01:45:14.000 align:start position:0%
they have to pay or not but I think the
 
01:45:17.470 --> 01:45:17.480 align:start position:0%
thing to keep in mind is you know what
 
01:45:20.830 --> 01:45:20.840 align:start position:0%
we're saying here is not the entire that
 
01:45:22.709 --> 01:45:22.719 align:start position:0%
has to be written because there's a lot
 
01:45:24.470 --> 01:45:24.480 align:start position:0%
of areas where one thing is going to
 
01:45:26.189 --> 01:45:26.199 align:start position:0%
overwrite another and that's the
 
01:45:28.070 --> 01:45:28.080 align:start position:0%
attorneys are you going to help us with
 
01:45:32.070 --> 01:45:32.080 align:start position:0%
that and uh chairman Roy and I met last
 
01:45:33.589 --> 01:45:33.599 align:start position:0%
week after our house session with the
 
01:45:34.830 --> 01:45:34.840 align:start position:0%
attorney that's going to that's actually
 
01:45:36.310 --> 01:45:36.320 align:start position:0%
was assigned to this specifically to
 
01:45:39.189 --> 01:45:39.199 align:start position:0%
help us and already has a list of all
 
01:45:41.470 --> 01:45:41.480 align:start position:0%
the the rsas we're looking at because a
 
01:45:43.470 --> 01:45:43.480 align:start position:0%
lot of them are intertwined and I think
 
01:45:45.470 --> 01:45:45.480 align:start position:0%
the other thing that I I would like to
 
01:45:47.470 --> 01:45:47.480 align:start position:0%
stress for everybody to keep in mind is
 
01:45:49.030 --> 01:45:49.040 align:start position:0%
we heard from a whole whole lot of
 
01:45:52.149 --> 01:45:52.159 align:start position:0%
people and there there is not one single
 
01:45:53.990 --> 01:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
thing that every person in this room is
 
01:45:55.950 --> 01:45:55.960 align:start position:0%
going to love every single part of we
 
01:45:58.550 --> 01:45:58.560 align:start position:0%
are really trying to go to the entire
 
01:46:00.430 --> 01:46:00.440 align:start position:0%
state of what is best for every single
 
01:46:02.550 --> 01:46:02.560 align:start position:0%
person not just the people in this room
 
01:46:04.430 --> 01:46:04.440 align:start position:0%
or a couple of the people that testified
 
01:46:06.629 --> 01:46:06.639 align:start position:0%
every single person because all 10
 
01:46:08.149 --> 01:46:08.159 align:start position:0%
counties are completely different and
 
01:46:09.950 --> 01:46:09.960 align:start position:0%
need something a little bit different
 
01:46:12.390 --> 01:46:12.400 align:start position:0%
and remember we have a whole another
 
01:46:15.629 --> 01:46:15.639 align:start position:0%
body that we have to also get this past
 
01:46:17.790 --> 01:46:17.800 align:start position:0%
and then a corner office so I think the
 
01:46:19.109 --> 01:46:19.119 align:start position:0%
thing to keep in mind when we're doing
 
01:46:21.589 --> 01:46:21.599 align:start position:0%
this is we're not all going to get
 
01:46:23.629 --> 01:46:23.639 align:start position:0%
everything we want we're not going to
 
01:46:25.030 --> 01:46:25.040 align:start position:0%
get everything out that we don't want
 
01:46:26.790 --> 01:46:26.800 align:start position:0%
representative gaite and I back there
 
01:46:28.669 --> 01:46:28.679 align:start position:0%
had to you know go into our separate
 
01:46:31.709 --> 01:46:31.719 align:start position:0%
corners for a minute but that's to be
 
01:46:33.510 --> 01:46:33.520 align:start position:0%
expected but we still came up with
 
01:46:36.030 --> 01:46:36.040 align:start position:0%
language that we both could agree on
 
01:46:37.510 --> 01:46:37.520 align:start position:0%
thinking that we all could agree on that
 
01:46:39.830 --> 01:46:39.840 align:start position:0%
so when we're moving forward I would
 
01:46:41.669 --> 01:46:41.679 align:start position:0%
just ask everybody to please keep that
 
01:46:43.950 --> 01:46:43.960 align:start position:0%
in mind it's not about one single person
 
01:46:46.510 --> 01:46:46.520 align:start position:0%
or one per one County it's about all 10
 
01:46:47.550 --> 01:46:47.560 align:start position:0%
and the last thing we want is the
 
01:46:49.470 --> 01:46:49.480 align:start position:0%
taxpayers to have to be paying for
 
01:46:50.990 --> 01:46:51.000 align:start position:0%
somebody's bail commissioner fees so we
 
01:46:53.750 --> 01:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
need to make it work for everybody I'm
 
01:46:55.589 --> 01:46:55.599 align:start position:0%
done with my rant thank you yeah thank
 
01:46:58.510 --> 01:46:58.520 align:start position:0%
you for that um I I would just say that
 
01:47:00.550 --> 01:47:00.560 align:start position:0%
I I would like the uh the ability for
 
01:47:02.830 --> 01:47:02.840 align:start position:0%
the court to get it if they can and if
 
01:47:04.790 --> 01:47:04.800 align:start position:0%
the you can't get blood from a stone so
 
01:47:06.870 --> 01:47:06.880 align:start position:0%
I don't want the court going after
 
01:47:09.109 --> 01:47:09.119 align:start position:0%
someone who who has not the ability to
 
01:47:11.310 --> 01:47:11.320 align:start position:0%
pay so I think that we just have we I
 
01:47:12.550 --> 01:47:12.560 align:start position:0%
mean we trust them whether or not to
 
01:47:14.470 --> 01:47:14.480 align:start position:0%
send someone to jail we should be able
 
01:47:16.030 --> 01:47:16.040 align:start position:0%
to trust them whether or not to go after
 
01:47:18.070 --> 01:47:18.080 align:start position:0%
money um from a person who cannot afford
 
01:47:21.589 --> 01:47:21.599 align:start position:0%
it and I would think that um
 
01:47:23.149 --> 01:47:23.159 align:start position:0%
they they're they're certainly wise
 
01:47:25.229 --> 01:47:25.239 align:start position:0%
enough to make that decision um we just
 
01:47:28.310 --> 01:47:28.320 align:start position:0%
want to leave them latitude um represent
 
01:47:31.629 --> 01:47:31.639 align:start position:0%
Murray thank you Mr chair do you know if
 
01:47:35.149 --> 01:47:35.159 align:start position:0%
um right now if someone is unable to pay
 
01:47:37.390 --> 01:47:37.400 align:start position:0%
that fee like or their release like they
 
01:47:39.870 --> 01:47:39.880 align:start position:0%
have unpaid fees if they can then be
 
01:47:42.030 --> 01:47:42.040 align:start position:0%
like arrested again for not paying those
 
01:47:44.430 --> 01:47:44.440 align:start position:0%
fees I do not believe so representative
 
01:47:47.430 --> 01:47:47.440 align:start position:0%
scitec do you have any insight into
 
01:47:50.149 --> 01:47:50.159 align:start position:0%
that I'm I'm not sure I understood the
 
01:47:52.589 --> 01:47:52.599 align:start position:0%
question question but you are bailed no
 
01:47:54.950 --> 01:47:54.960 align:start position:0%
matter what yeah but can you be um have
 
01:47:56.910 --> 01:47:56.920 align:start position:0%
you ever heard of a so when someone's
 
01:47:59.070 --> 01:47:59.080 align:start position:0%
determined Eng by the court they don't
 
01:48:01.669 --> 01:48:01.679 align:start position:0%
go after the bail fee later and someone
 
01:48:03.910 --> 01:48:03.920 align:start position:0%
be arrested for I've never heard of that
 
01:48:05.709 --> 01:48:05.719 align:start position:0%
yeah nor have I I it's my understanding
 
01:48:07.830 --> 01:48:07.840 align:start position:0%
that once you detered inent it's just
 
01:48:09.709 --> 01:48:09.719 align:start position:0%
written off but at the same time the
 
01:48:11.830 --> 01:48:11.840 align:start position:0%
bill Commissioners aren't get paid so
 
01:48:12.870 --> 01:48:12.880 align:start position:0%
because that's where they get their
 
01:48:15.709 --> 01:48:15.719 align:start position:0%
money from now we're putting that onus
 
01:48:17.669 --> 01:48:17.679 align:start position:0%
on the court to say you're paying the
 
01:48:18.910 --> 01:48:18.920 align:start position:0%
baill Commissioners and if you decide
 
01:48:20.750 --> 01:48:20.760 align:start position:0%
the W of the money that's on you that's
 
01:48:20.760 --> 01:48:23.149 align:start position:0%
the W of the money that's on you that's
your

01:48:23.149 --> 01:48:23.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:25.750 --> 01:48:25.760 align:start position:0%
budget with the allowance that if
 
01:48:28.149 --> 01:48:28.159 align:start position:0%
someone is Indigent the court can wave
 
01:48:30.589 --> 01:48:30.599 align:start position:0%
that um representative wheeler well I
 
01:48:31.709 --> 01:48:31.719 align:start position:0%
just want thank you Mr chairman I just
 
01:48:33.189 --> 01:48:33.199 align:start position:0%
wanted to say it's it's important if
 
01:48:35.229 --> 01:48:35.239 align:start position:0%
someone's Indigent and that we make sure
 
01:48:37.390 --> 01:48:37.400 align:start position:0%
that we are being compassionate if
 
01:48:38.790 --> 01:48:38.800 align:start position:0%
someone doesn't have enough funds but
 
01:48:41.070 --> 01:48:41.080 align:start position:0%
it's also important that to note bill
 
01:48:43.030 --> 01:48:43.040 align:start position:0%
Commissioners are doing a incredibly
 
01:48:45.229 --> 01:48:45.239 align:start position:0%
important service and they're driving
 
01:48:47.910 --> 01:48:47.920 align:start position:0%
far distances at late hours to be able
 
01:48:49.910 --> 01:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
to go out and and do what you said this
 
01:48:52.149 --> 01:48:52.159 align:start position:0%
is a very critical piece to our system
 
01:48:54.669 --> 01:48:54.679 align:start position:0%
here and they need to be paid um so I
 
01:48:56.629 --> 01:48:56.639 align:start position:0%
think that's sort of yeah we're going to
 
01:48:58.669 --> 01:48:58.679 align:start position:0%
try and balance that exctly exactly yeah
 
01:49:02.149 --> 01:49:02.159 align:start position:0%
agreed um and also just to address what
 
01:49:03.709 --> 01:49:03.719 align:start position:0%
representative scitech about he wasn't a
 
01:49:06.189 --> 01:49:06.199 align:start position:0%
big fan of the Rays um we heard a lot
 
01:49:07.750 --> 01:49:07.760 align:start position:0%
about you know the distances some of
 
01:49:09.910 --> 01:49:09.920 align:start position:0%
these folks have to drive the price of
 
01:49:12.750 --> 01:49:12.760 align:start position:0%
gasoline is ridiculous right now rather
 
01:49:14.709 --> 01:49:14.719 align:start position:0%
than getting into a system where they
 
01:49:16.550 --> 01:49:16.560 align:start position:0%
were reimburse for mileage you'd have to
 
01:49:19.750 --> 01:49:19.760 align:start position:0%
hire employees just to track the mileage
 
01:49:21.589 --> 01:49:21.599 align:start position:0%
it's us to say okay we're going to bump
 
01:49:22.350 --> 01:49:22.360 align:start position:0%
it to
 
01:49:25.669 --> 01:49:25.679 align:start position:0%
$50 um it hasn't been raised since
 
01:49:28.550 --> 01:49:28.560 align:start position:0%
inflation has been spiking um so frankly
 
01:49:30.510 --> 01:49:30.520 align:start position:0%
I I don't think $10 is that big a deal
 
01:49:31.830 --> 01:49:31.840 align:start position:0%
and it's in line with what other states
 
01:49:35.390 --> 01:49:35.400 align:start position:0%
are charging to so further questions
 
01:49:37.390 --> 01:49:37.400 align:start position:0%
comments okay what I'd like to do now is
 
01:49:40.430 --> 01:49:40.440 align:start position:0%
hold an informal vote um if everyone's
 
01:49:43.109 --> 01:49:43.119 align:start position:0%
in favor Mr chairman yes sir ju just a
 
01:49:45.310 --> 01:49:45.320 align:start position:0%
quick note from the field as somebody
 
01:49:47.750 --> 01:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
who has bailed Indigent people that's
 
01:49:49.910 --> 01:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
not a problem I don't mind that at at
 
01:49:49.920 --> 01:49:50.830 align:start position:0%
not a problem I don't mind that at at
all

01:49:50.830 --> 01:49:50.840 align:start position:0%
all
 
01:49:53.030 --> 01:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
that's you do that for the team and he's
 
01:49:56.030 --> 01:49:56.040 align:start position:0%
still Mr Jones as far as I'm concerned
 
01:49:58.189 --> 01:49:58.199 align:start position:0%
despite many issues I'll tell you what
 
01:50:00.149 --> 01:50:00.159 align:start position:0%
ra bail Commissioners res I'm not sure
 
01:50:02.270 --> 01:50:02.280 align:start position:0%
we're going to do anything here but when
 
01:50:06.070 --> 01:50:06.080 align:start position:0%
you know a defendant knows he cannot be
 
01:50:08.229 --> 01:50:08.239 align:start position:0%
bailed and he still asks for a bail
 
01:50:10.149 --> 01:50:10.159 align:start position:0%
commissioner to come in and say that he
 
01:50:11.790 --> 01:50:11.800 align:start position:0%
doesn't have the money but he just wants
 
01:50:15.189 --> 01:50:15.199 align:start position:0%
to cycle you that it isn't a good faith
 
01:50:18.750 --> 01:50:18.760 align:start position:0%
indent it's a guy it doesn't happen
 
01:50:21.070 --> 01:50:21.080 align:start position:0%
explain how how how he knows he can't be
 
01:50:24.950 --> 01:50:24.960 align:start position:0%
bailed because there may be a bench
 
01:50:28.149 --> 01:50:28.159 align:start position:0%
warrant for him yeah and I'm looking at
 
01:50:31.109 --> 01:50:31.119 align:start position:0%
it and I'm saying based on what the
 
01:50:32.950 --> 01:50:32.960 align:start position:0%
police have said there are no
 
01:50:35.229 --> 01:50:35.239 align:start position:0%
circumstances under which I want to let
 
01:50:37.510 --> 01:50:37.520 align:start position:0%
this person out without has having seen
 
01:50:40.550 --> 01:50:40.560 align:start position:0%
a judge okay so I want them to ask to
 
01:50:43.790 --> 01:50:43.800 align:start position:0%
decline a bail commissioner and see a
 
01:50:45.990 --> 01:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
judge in the morning because I'm not
 
01:50:48.709 --> 01:50:48.719 align:start position:0%
comfortable letting this person out and
 
01:50:50.430 --> 01:50:50.440 align:start position:0%
I tell them that you're not allowed to
 
01:50:53.270 --> 01:50:53.280 align:start position:0%
set a bail by phone but there are some
 
01:50:54.990 --> 01:50:55.000 align:start position:0%
black and white situations where you
 
01:50:57.189 --> 01:50:57.199 align:start position:0%
just know I want to see a bail
 
01:50:58.990 --> 01:50:59.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner I come in I said I've told
 
01:51:01.390 --> 01:51:01.400 align:start position:0%
you this why are you doing this yeah I
 
01:51:05.030 --> 01:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
want my bail he had no money by the way
 
01:51:07.669 --> 01:51:07.679 align:start position:0%
it isn't in that case it's not the money
 
01:51:10.109 --> 01:51:10.119 align:start position:0%
I'm telling you I don't mind I'm wasting
 
01:51:14.149 --> 01:51:14.159 align:start position:0%
time now I don't mind a Indigent I I
 
01:51:16.189 --> 01:51:16.199 align:start position:0%
that's a human being this guy is his
 
01:51:17.709 --> 01:51:17.719 align:start position:0%
life is lost I'm going to go home to a
 
01:51:21.550 --> 01:51:21.560 align:start position:0%
warm bed this guy is where is his life
 
01:51:25.870 --> 01:51:25.880 align:start position:0%
going it's very easy to un not to be
 
01:51:28.149 --> 01:51:28.159 align:start position:0%
resentful of that it's the people
 
01:51:30.270 --> 01:51:30.280 align:start position:0%
jerking the system around that are the
 
01:51:33.350 --> 01:51:33.360 align:start position:0%
anoying thank you yeah thank you
 
01:51:34.990 --> 01:51:35.000 align:start position:0%
fortunately I I don't I don't know that
 
01:51:36.629 --> 01:51:36.639 align:start position:0%
there's anything we can do about that
 
01:51:39.390 --> 01:51:39.400 align:start position:0%
other than try to raise better children
 
01:51:42.430 --> 01:51:42.440 align:start position:0%
um representative uh Muse yeah one one
 
01:51:44.790 --> 01:51:44.800 align:start position:0%
last thing um one thing that would be
 
01:51:47.390 --> 01:51:47.400 align:start position:0%
good to do would be to put something in
 
01:51:50.149 --> 01:51:50.159 align:start position:0%
here that makes tellah herings more of
 
01:51:52.270 --> 01:51:52.280 align:start position:0%
an option um those are something that
 
01:51:53.550 --> 01:51:53.560 align:start position:0%
that's something that we actually
 
01:51:55.750 --> 01:51:55.760 align:start position:0%
considered as an experiment pre-co when
 
01:51:57.589 --> 01:51:57.599 align:start position:0%
we had the original Commission on bail
 
01:51:59.750 --> 01:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
commissioner pay yeah and I think one of
 
01:52:01.390 --> 01:52:01.400 align:start position:0%
the things that we learned kind of
 
01:52:03.550 --> 01:52:03.560 align:start position:0%
during the whole Co experience was that
 
01:52:06.149 --> 01:52:06.159 align:start position:0%
was something that actually works so one
 
01:52:09.390 --> 01:52:09.400 align:start position:0%
of the things we heard from some of the
 
01:52:11.910 --> 01:52:11.920 align:start position:0%
uh you know some of the police officers
 
01:52:13.550 --> 01:52:13.560 align:start position:0%
and some of the county jail Personnel
 
01:52:15.270 --> 01:52:15.280 align:start position:0%
were just times when bail Commissioners
 
01:52:17.589 --> 01:52:17.599 align:start position:0%
simply aren't available and as much as
 
01:52:21.229 --> 01:52:21.239 align:start position:0%
we'd like to try and resolve the
 
01:52:23.870 --> 01:52:23.880 align:start position:0%
attraction and retention situation there
 
01:52:25.750 --> 01:52:25.760 align:start position:0%
are going to continue to be issue you
 
01:52:28.709 --> 01:52:28.719 align:start position:0%
know times when having a bail commission
 
01:52:31.189 --> 01:52:31.199 align:start position:0%
you know basically not having a bail
 
01:52:33.589 --> 01:52:33.599 align:start position:0%
commissioner could mean that somebody is
 
01:52:35.189 --> 01:52:35.199 align:start position:0%
sitting in jail longer than they need to
 
01:52:38.310 --> 01:52:38.320 align:start position:0%
be sitting in jail so you know one of
 
01:52:41.069 --> 01:52:41.079 align:start position:0%
the things that you know that that I
 
01:52:43.510 --> 01:52:43.520 align:start position:0%
would uh that I think maybe we should
 
01:52:45.550 --> 01:52:45.560 align:start position:0%
consider part of this is is actually
 
01:52:49.229 --> 01:52:49.239 align:start position:0%
making uh tah hearings uh basically
 
01:52:52.069 --> 01:52:52.079 align:start position:0%
putting the money equal footing I I'm
 
01:52:53.390 --> 01:52:53.400 align:start position:0%
I'm correct me if I'm wrong one of the
 
01:52:54.990 --> 01:52:55.000 align:start position:0%
bail Commissioners that testified she
 
01:52:57.270 --> 01:52:57.280 align:start position:0%
said that she was still doing um
 
01:52:59.310 --> 01:52:59.320 align:start position:0%
telephonic bail hearings she did them
 
01:53:01.470 --> 01:53:01.480 align:start position:0%
during Co and she's still so I I'm not
 
01:53:03.470 --> 01:53:03.480 align:start position:0%
sure that anywhere in statute it's
 
01:53:05.830 --> 01:53:05.840 align:start position:0%
prohibited um from conducting a bail
 
01:53:08.069 --> 01:53:08.079 align:start position:0%
hearing via telephone representative
 
01:53:10.149 --> 01:53:10.159 align:start position:0%
Stone I would think that this is getting
 
01:53:11.310 --> 01:53:11.320 align:start position:0%
kind of out of the weeds of what we're
 
01:53:13.550 --> 01:53:13.560 align:start position:0%
looking at currently and I think at this
 
01:53:16.149 --> 01:53:16.159 align:start position:0%
point we should focus back on the core
 
01:53:19.270 --> 01:53:19.280 align:start position:0%
issues operationally if uh the court
 
01:53:21.550 --> 01:53:21.560 align:start position:0%
seems to in emergency orders situation
 
01:53:22.830 --> 01:53:22.840 align:start position:0%
where the governor May declare one I
 
01:53:23.830 --> 01:53:23.840 align:start position:0%
think that should be handled at a
 
01:53:25.589 --> 01:53:25.599 align:start position:0%
discretionary by the Judiciary and not
 
01:53:28.950 --> 01:53:28.960 align:start position:0%
by legislative codified no I I just if
 
01:53:31.229 --> 01:53:31.239 align:start position:0%
uh representative M's point just struck
 
01:53:34.229 --> 01:53:34.239 align:start position:0%
me that if if it's prohibited I would
 
01:53:37.830 --> 01:53:37.840 align:start position:0%
not object to saying the court May if it
 
01:53:39.950 --> 01:53:39.960 align:start position:0%
so chooses conduct or authorize the
 
01:53:42.109 --> 01:53:42.119 align:start position:0%
conduction due to the shortage in staff
 
01:53:44.470 --> 01:53:44.480 align:start position:0%
or something like that allow them to do
 
01:53:46.229 --> 01:53:46.239 align:start position:0%
it but if it's not blocked already it
 
01:53:47.390 --> 01:53:47.400 align:start position:0%
seems to me they're allowed to do it
 
01:53:50.830 --> 01:53:50.840 align:start position:0%
that seems like a mo Point yeah um
 
01:53:53.830 --> 01:53:53.840 align:start position:0%
anything else okay so can I just get by
 
01:53:55.790 --> 01:53:55.800 align:start position:0%
a show of hands all in favor of us
 
01:53:57.910 --> 01:53:57.920 align:start position:0%
sending what we just discussed over to
 
01:54:02.149 --> 01:54:02.159 align:start position:0%
the um over to lb to be drafted so that
 
01:54:05.390 --> 01:54:05.400 align:start position:0%
we can have an actual real vote on it um
 
01:54:05.400 --> 01:54:06.990 align:start position:0%
we can have an actual real vote on it um
hopefully

01:54:06.990 --> 01:54:07.000 align:start position:0%
hopefully
 
01:54:09.550 --> 01:54:09.560 align:start position:0%
tomorrow all in
 
01:54:12.069 --> 01:54:12.079 align:start position:0%
favor good everyone let the record
 
01:54:14.709 --> 01:54:14.719 align:start position:0%
reflect everyone let the record reflect
 
01:54:17.350 --> 01:54:17.360 align:start position:0%
everyone voted yes and we will send this
 
01:54:19.990 --> 01:54:20.000 align:start position:0%
over to uh legislative services today
 
01:54:22.149 --> 01:54:22.159 align:start position:0%
and we will vote on it tomorrow to send
 
01:54:23.669 --> 01:54:23.679 align:start position:0%
to the full
 
01:54:27.149 --> 01:54:27.159 align:start position:0%
committee and with that we are going to
 
01:54:29.350 --> 01:54:29.360 align:start position:0%
close for the day tomorrow is going to
 
01:54:31.189 --> 01:54:31.199 align:start position:0%
be a little more in depth and probably
 
01:54:33.629 --> 01:54:33.639 align:start position:0%
plan on being here a little bit longer
 
01:54:35.310 --> 01:54:35.320 align:start position:0%
um we're going to start delving into the
 
01:54:38.550 --> 01:54:38.560 align:start position:0%
actual issue of reoffending while on
 
01:54:41.470 --> 01:54:41.480 align:start position:0%
bail tomorrow um that one might not go
 
01:54:45.629 --> 01:54:45.639 align:start position:0%
as smoothly um but I'm hoping it will
 
01:54:48.910 --> 01:54:48.920 align:start position:0%
and next week uh we're going to get into
 
01:54:50.669 --> 01:54:50.679 align:start position:0%

01:54:53.310 --> 01:54:53.320 align:start position:0%
second ago about um the the management
 
01:54:57.189 --> 01:54:57.199 align:start position:0%
