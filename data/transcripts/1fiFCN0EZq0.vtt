00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 align:start position:0%
pink cards at the moment so are we
 
00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 align:start position:0%
yes yes someone should should somebody's
 
00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 align:start position:0%

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.570 align:start position:0%
already working on it but
yeah

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chair members of the
 
00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.089 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chair members of the
committee

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:14.099 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 align:start position:0%
I'm Carol McGuire representing Merrimack
 
00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 align:start position:0%
District 27 which is Allenstown
 
00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 align:start position:0%
Dunbarton Epsom and Hooksett
 
00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 align:start position:0%
this bill is a recommendation of the
 
00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 align:start position:0%
study committee on oplc operations
 
00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 align:start position:0%
and it is essentially a recodification
 
00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 align:start position:0%
of the Licensing Laws to clarify who is
 
00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 align:start position:0%
responsible for what and how and what
 
00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 align:start position:0%
the relationships are
 
00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 align:start position:0%
so the first part of the bill starting
 
00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 align:start position:0%
on page two is an overview of the office
 
00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 align:start position:0%
of professional licensure and
 
00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 align:start position:0%
certification it's got the list of
 
00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 align:start position:0%
boards which is all of Page Three and
 
00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 align:start position:0%
most of all of page two and most of Page
 
00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 align:start position:0%
Three it's got the unclassified officer
 
00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.190 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:03:17.149 --> 00:03:17.159 align:start position:0%
on on page five Roman 2 which starts on
 
00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 align:start position:0%
line 10 is actually a bit of a a
 
00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 align:start position:0%
duplication of
 
00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 align:start position:0%
house bill
 
00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.760 align:start position:0%
house bill
um

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:28.770 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:30.350 align:start position:0%
um
[Music]

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:32.819 align:start position:0%
where's that 445
 
00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 align:start position:0%
so we we will need to consider how to
 
00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 align:start position:0%
handle the duplication because it's not
 
00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 align:start position:0%
identical but it's very close including
 
00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 align:start position:0%
the five million dollar cap on the fund
 
00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 align:start position:0%
uh what else we got there
 
00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 align:start position:0%
the next fund is the
 
00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:54.299 align:start position:0%
impaired professionals fund which is
 
00:03:59.149 --> 00:03:59.159 align:start position:0%
which covers the cost of treatment for
 
00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:01.799 align:start position:0%
doctors dentists Pharmacists and nurses
 
00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 align:start position:0%
that I'm sure of and possibly others
 
00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 align:start position:0%
that are impaired by drugs and or
 
00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:11.580 align:start position:0%
alcohol and so they are that those
 
00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:15.360 align:start position:0%
people pay pay for this and are assured
 
00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 align:start position:0%
to it
 
00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 align:start position:0%
and what else then there is the
 
00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
rulemaking authority
 
00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 align:start position:0%
which includes a
 
00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 align:start position:0%
um a notice that any existing law any
 
00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:31.979 align:start position:0%
existing rule
 
00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:33.770 align:start position:0%
existing rule
is

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:36.780 align:start position:0%
still valid until it is revised
 
00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 align:start position:0%
or repealed so that we don't have to
 
00:04:41.749 --> 00:04:41.759 align:start position:0%
worry about uh
 
00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 align:start position:0%
repealing all of our existing rules when
 
00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:48.660 align:start position:0%
the the loss change
 
00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460 align:start position:0%
and then there are temporary licenses
 
00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 align:start position:0%
license renewals procedures complaints
 
00:04:58.969 --> 00:04:58.979 align:start position:0%
and investigations
 
00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.280 align:start position:0%
more complaints sanctions licensing
 
00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.189 align:start position:0%
more complaints sanctions licensing
procedures

00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:04.199 align:start position:0%
procedures
 
00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:05.570 align:start position:0%
procedures
Etc

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:05.580 align:start position:0%
Etc
 
00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:07.860 align:start position:0%
and then there is the oversight
 
00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.440 align:start position:0%
committee which was established by
 
00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:13.979 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 330 last year
 
00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.320 align:start position:0%
which is in effect it has not been
 
00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 align:start position:0%
staffed yet that is nobody's been
 
00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:20.639 align:start position:0%
appointed to it that I know of
 
00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:23.460 align:start position:0%
so we would that needs to be confirmed
 
00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:25.440 align:start position:0%
that that's correct
 
00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 align:start position:0%
I think it's fun
 
00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:30.180 align:start position:0%
and then starting on page
 
00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:33.539 align:start position:0%
13 there's a whole list of repeals
 
00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:38.039 align:start position:0%
and both of sections and
 
00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:40.919 align:start position:0%
line outs in other
 
00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:44.639 align:start position:0%
in the in continuing sections of law
 
00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
in order to coordinate with the first
 
00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
part of the bill it starts with the
 
00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:51.240 align:start position:0%
board of accountancy
 
00:05:54.529 --> 00:05:54.539 align:start position:0%
and goes on down to um who's the last
 
00:05:54.539 --> 00:05:58.510 align:start position:0%
and goes on down to um who's the last
one

00:05:58.510 --> 00:05:58.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:01.740 align:start position:0%
reflexologists and Physicians
 
00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:02.510 align:start position:0%
reflexologists and Physicians
Etc

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:02.520 align:start position:0%
Etc
 
00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:04.249 align:start position:0%
Etc
so

00:06:04.249 --> 00:06:04.259 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:06:04.259 --> 00:06:05.689 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:06:05.689 --> 00:06:05.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:10.129 --> 00:06:10.139 align:start position:0%
the intent is to clarify that the oplc
 
00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
takes care of administrative
 
00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:16.500 align:start position:0%
duties and the boards are responsible
 
00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:17.689 align:start position:0%
duties and the boards are responsible
for

00:06:17.689 --> 00:06:17.699 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:21.740 align:start position:0%
the items that need professional skill
 
00:06:25.309 --> 00:06:25.319 align:start position:0%
reviewing any license application that
 
00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:27.740 align:start position:0%
is not perfectly obviously
 
00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:31.020 align:start position:0%
suitable including criminal records that
 
00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:32.660 align:start position:0%
are not perfect
 
00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:36.300 align:start position:0%
discipline and sanction responsibility
 
00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:39.360 align:start position:0%
of the of the boards
 
00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:42.120 align:start position:0%
and what else and a continuing education
 
00:06:44.809 --> 00:06:44.819 align:start position:0%
approving continuing education courses
 
00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:47.880 align:start position:0%
those are the the responsibilities of
 
00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:49.020 align:start position:0%
the board
 
00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:52.620 align:start position:0%
and the oplc is in
 
00:06:57.650 --> 00:06:57.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:59.510 --> 00:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
and I believe this bill is going to
 
00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:01.800 align:start position:0%
subcommittee on Friday
 
00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:03.560 align:start position:0%
so if
 
00:07:05.749 --> 00:07:05.759 align:start position:0%
I may not be able to answer your
 
00:07:08.809 --> 00:07:08.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:10.860 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative
 
00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:13.880 align:start position:0%
any questions yes representative Lucas
 
00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:16.740 align:start position:0%
so you mentioned that the disciplinary
 
00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:18.600 align:start position:0%
stuff is belongs to the board but to
 
00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:21.120 align:start position:0%
what extent is like organization and
 
00:07:22.969 --> 00:07:22.979 align:start position:0%
administrative support and all that
 
00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:27.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:31.129 --> 00:07:31.139 align:start position:0%
it should mostly be handled by oplc so
 
00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:33.780 align:start position:0%
they would have the staff that produces
 
00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:36.120 align:start position:0%
the licenses that produces the agendas
 
00:07:39.469 --> 00:07:39.479 align:start position:0%
for the board meetings that refers the
 
00:07:42.529 --> 00:07:42.539 align:start position:0%
questions the complaints that look like
 
00:07:44.689 --> 00:07:44.699 align:start position:0%
they they need to be resolved to the
 
00:07:44.699 --> 00:07:46.129 align:start position:0%
they they need to be resolved to the
board

00:07:46.129 --> 00:07:46.139 align:start position:0%
board
 
00:07:48.529 --> 00:07:48.539 align:start position:0%
okay follow-up follow-up so basically
 
00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:50.340 align:start position:0%
the board would wouldn't have to would
 
00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:52.800 align:start position:0%
just look at them make decisions based
 
00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:54.180 align:start position:0%
on the professional
 
00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:56.340 align:start position:0%
experience and then that would then go
 
00:07:58.850 --> 00:07:58.860 align:start position:0%
back to oplc for whatever that's the
 
00:08:00.529 --> 00:08:00.539 align:start position:0%
intent except that in the case of
 
00:08:03.589 --> 00:08:03.599 align:start position:0%
discipline the board is essentially the
 
00:08:03.599 --> 00:08:04.430 align:start position:0%
discipline the board is essentially the
jury

00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:04.440 align:start position:0%
jury
 
00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:08.160 align:start position:0%
and they determine whether discipline is
 
00:08:11.089 --> 00:08:11.099 align:start position:0%
required and if so what if any penalty
 
00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:14.460 align:start position:0%
should be applied they have the choice
 
00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:16.070 align:start position:0%
should be applied they have the choice
of

00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:08:18.610 --> 00:08:18.620 align:start position:0%
uh sanctions yanking the license
 
00:08:23.089 --> 00:08:23.099 align:start position:0%
additional training fines they have a
 
00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:26.280 align:start position:0%
full gamut of penalties as appropriate
 
00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:29.900 align:start position:0%
for the discipline okay thank you
 
00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:33.000 align:start position:0%

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:06.170 align:start position:0%
representative will infantine uh from
Manchester

00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:06.180 align:start position:0%
Manchester
 
00:09:09.170 --> 00:09:09.180 align:start position:0%
I'm an insurance agent by trade but I'm
 
00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:10.920 align:start position:0%
also the vice chairman of the
 
00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:12.240 align:start position:0%
electricians board
 
00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
and I've been serving for about
 
00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:19.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:21.769 --> 00:09:21.779 align:start position:0%
I wrote on my pink card I wasn't sure if
 
00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:24.120 align:start position:0%
I liked this bill or not as parts of it
 
00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:26.160 align:start position:0%
I do there's parts of it I don't
 
00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:28.740 align:start position:0%
now I did not attend some of the summer
 
00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:31.080 align:start position:0%
meetings but I'd have read
 
00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:33.980 align:start position:0%
every single page of all the minutes
 
00:09:36.170 --> 00:09:36.180 align:start position:0%
that were produced from this up
 
00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:37.860 align:start position:0%
committee this summer
 
00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:39.470 align:start position:0%
committee this summer
and

00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:39.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:42.300 align:start position:0%
I don't have a problem per se with the
 
00:09:45.970 --> 00:09:45.980 align:start position:0%
fact that the oplc was this big animal
 
00:09:48.769 --> 00:09:48.779 align:start position:0%
that needed to be better organized
 
00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
without question
 
00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:52.670 align:start position:0%
without question
um

00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:52.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:55.490 --> 00:09:55.500 align:start position:0%
the commissioner or um
 
00:09:57.829 --> 00:09:57.839 align:start position:0%
tells us that well there were different
 
00:09:59.690 --> 00:09:59.700 align:start position:0%
boards that don't meet they don't show
 
00:10:02.269 --> 00:10:02.279 align:start position:0%
up we can't get a quorum they have their
 
00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:04.440 align:start position:0%
own different letterhead and all kinds
 
00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
of things were just going all over the
 
00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:08.040 align:start position:0%
place so she's made Herculean efforts to
 
00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:09.720 align:start position:0%
try to organize things
 
00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:11.940 align:start position:0%
but I'm very cautious and very concerned
 
00:10:14.509 --> 00:10:14.519 align:start position:0%
that some of the things have made gone a
 
00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:15.720 align:start position:0%
little too far
 
00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:17.210 align:start position:0%
little too far
and

00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:17.220 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:19.380 align:start position:0%
part of the reason is because there are
 
00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:20.820 align:start position:0%
so many of these different organizations
 
00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:22.920 align:start position:0%
within the oplc
 
00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:26.220 align:start position:0%
and not everyone has the same issues you
 
00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:29.160 align:start position:0%
have a bunch of
 
00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:32.100 align:start position:0%
from construction people to a massage
 
00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
therapists to Funeral Directors they
 
00:10:36.769 --> 00:10:36.779 align:start position:0%
don't all have the same things in common
 
00:10:38.389 --> 00:10:38.399 align:start position:0%
they don't have all the same types of
 
00:10:38.399 --> 00:10:39.769 align:start position:0%
they don't have all the same types of
issues

00:10:39.769 --> 00:10:39.779 align:start position:0%
issues
 
00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:42.120 align:start position:0%
I would rather see this broken down into
 
00:10:44.389 --> 00:10:44.399 align:start position:0%
three subsections within the oplc I'm
 
00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
not trying to create anything different
 
00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:49.320 align:start position:0%
but the construction related trades are
 
00:10:52.069 --> 00:10:52.079 align:start position:0%
one thing the health and related trades
 
00:10:53.389 --> 00:10:53.399 align:start position:0%
are another and then the professional
 
00:10:56.389 --> 00:10:56.399 align:start position:0%
related trades are another
 
00:10:58.910 --> 00:10:58.920 align:start position:0%
and I think the
 
00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:02.100 align:start position:0%
trying to put all these things into one
 
00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:05.820 align:start position:0%
it really doesn't match now
 
00:11:08.569 --> 00:11:08.579 align:start position:0%
there's something in here about fines
 
00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
the electrician's board has never had
 
00:11:12.889 --> 00:11:12.899 align:start position:0%
fines when we have disciplinary issues
 
00:11:14.569 --> 00:11:14.579 align:start position:0%
we bring someone in and we have
 
00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:16.500 align:start position:0%
mechanisms allowing us to suspend their
 
00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:18.540 align:start position:0%
license to make them go to additional
 
00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:21.240 align:start position:0%
education we can ask them to have to
 
00:11:23.329 --> 00:11:23.339 align:start position:0%
present every month where their jobs are
 
00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:24.540 align:start position:0%
going to be so they can be inspected
 
00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:25.860 align:start position:0%
more often and make sure they're doing
 
00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:28.860 align:start position:0%
things now that may be much different
 
00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:31.620 align:start position:0%
from a different organization
 
00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
that maybe is used to or the only way to
 
00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:37.260 align:start position:0%
get people to pay attention is to give
 
00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
them a three thousand dollar fine
 
00:11:41.090 --> 00:11:41.100 align:start position:0%
but I'm not sure it needs to be across
 
00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:43.560 align:start position:0%
the board my biggest issue has to do
 
00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:46.260 align:start position:0%
with page 20 of the bill
 
00:11:48.050 --> 00:11:48.060 align:start position:0%
if if you see that has to do with
 
00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:50.090 align:start position:0%
if if you see that has to do with
electricians

00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:50.100 align:start position:0%
electricians
 
00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:51.170 align:start position:0%
electricians
um

00:11:51.170 --> 00:11:51.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:53.100 align:start position:0%
they've repealed a lot of their our
 
00:11:55.850 --> 00:11:55.860 align:start position:0%
decision-making ability right now people
 
00:11:58.850 --> 00:11:58.860 align:start position:0%
volunteer like myself to be in these
 
00:11:58.860 --> 00:11:59.810 align:start position:0%
volunteer like myself to be in these
boards

00:11:59.810 --> 00:11:59.820 align:start position:0%
boards
 
00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:02.030 align:start position:0%
boards
and

00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:02.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:12:03.710 --> 00:12:03.720 align:start position:0%
as the chairman told me you know
 
00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:05.160 align:start position:0%
sometimes we are the electrical
 
00:12:07.370 --> 00:12:07.380 align:start position:0%
contractors police
 
00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
people get in trouble they come to us we
 
00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
adjudicate these things and there seems
 
00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:14.160 align:start position:0%
to be a movement toward getting rid of
 
00:12:16.130 --> 00:12:16.140 align:start position:0%
having boards be in that position
 
00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:18.050 align:start position:0%
having boards be in that position
anymore

00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:18.060 align:start position:0%
anymore
 
00:12:19.850 --> 00:12:19.860 align:start position:0%
they want to have
 
00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:21.230 align:start position:0%
they want to have
um

00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:21.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:23.449 --> 00:12:23.459 align:start position:0%
experts brought in they don't they want
 
00:12:25.610 --> 00:12:25.620 align:start position:0%
professionals to deal with
 
00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:28.449 align:start position:0%
professionals to deal with
um

00:12:28.449 --> 00:12:28.459 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:31.130 --> 00:12:31.140 align:start position:0%
investigating a situation and giving a
 
00:12:32.569 --> 00:12:32.579 align:start position:0%
fine or doing whatever going through
 
00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:34.320 align:start position:0%
that whole hearings process when someone
 
00:12:36.530 --> 00:12:36.540 align:start position:0%
has done something wrong well if that's
 
00:12:38.389 --> 00:12:38.399 align:start position:0%
the case what are we here for
 
00:12:41.210 --> 00:12:41.220 align:start position:0%
why do I bother with my time
 
00:12:44.269 --> 00:12:44.279 align:start position:0%
10 months 10 10 meetings a year
 
00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:46.320 align:start position:0%
and if you take away all the board's
 
00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:48.600 align:start position:0%
Authority then why would why would
 
00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:51.240 align:start position:0%
people like me volunteer why bother
 
00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:52.740 align:start position:0%
you're going to have people even wanting
 
00:12:55.490 --> 00:12:55.500 align:start position:0%
to go when the real meat and potatoes of
 
00:12:57.230 --> 00:12:57.240 align:start position:0%
what we're supposed to do as our peers
 
00:13:00.829 --> 00:13:00.839 align:start position:0%
through our through our trade
 
00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:03.800 align:start position:0%
I can't really do anything
 
00:13:06.410 --> 00:13:06.420 align:start position:0%
happened and I don't know what it is and
 
00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:07.800 align:start position:0%
no one will tell me and I'm not a
 
00:13:09.170 --> 00:13:09.180 align:start position:0%
conspiracy theorist but something
 
00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:10.730 align:start position:0%
conspiracy theorist but something
happened

00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:10.740 align:start position:0%
happened
 
00:13:13.069 --> 00:13:13.079 align:start position:0%
where someone got in trouble or someone
 
00:13:14.449 --> 00:13:14.459 align:start position:0%
didn't do what they were supposed to do
 
00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:16.440 align:start position:0%
because there's been a major change in
 
00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:17.940 align:start position:0%
the last year of what's going on in the
 
00:13:20.329 --> 00:13:20.339 align:start position:0%
electrician's board we used to ask for a
 
00:13:21.710 --> 00:13:21.720 align:start position:0%
lawyer to come in if we had a situation
 
00:13:23.090 --> 00:13:23.100 align:start position:0%
now they're automatically there at every
 
00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:24.230 align:start position:0%
now they're automatically there at every
meeting

00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:24.240 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
now that the oplc wants to create a
 
00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:28.190 align:start position:0%
now that the oplc wants to create a
matrix

00:13:28.190 --> 00:13:28.200 align:start position:0%
matrix
 
00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:29.880 align:start position:0%
of if someone gets in trouble what the
 
00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:31.620 align:start position:0%
fines can be and what the procedure is
 
00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:33.600 align:start position:0%
well if you tell everybody out in the
 
00:13:35.329 --> 00:13:35.339 align:start position:0%
industry and everybody knows what the
 
00:13:37.370 --> 00:13:37.380 align:start position:0%
the the the
 
00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:37.970 align:start position:0%
the the the
um

00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:37.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:41.930 --> 00:13:41.940 align:start position:0%
penalty will be for violating the rules
 
00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:43.560 align:start position:0%
don't make a business decision whether
 
00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
or not oh well that's always going to
 
00:13:46.610 --> 00:13:46.620 align:start position:0%
happen to me
 
00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:48.350 align:start position:0%
happen to me
okay

00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:48.360 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:13:50.210 --> 00:13:50.220 align:start position:0%
I guess that's a business decision I'll
 
00:13:52.069 --> 00:13:52.079 align:start position:0%
take that three thousand dollar fine or
 
00:13:55.730 --> 00:13:55.740 align:start position:0%
I'll take that uh fine that is in this
 
00:13:57.350 --> 00:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
this Matrix and it's not always that
 
00:13:59.569 --> 00:13:59.579 align:start position:0%
simple nothing is ever easy we had the
 
00:14:02.389 --> 00:14:02.399 align:start position:0%
hardest meeting we ever had yesterday
 
00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:04.440 align:start position:0%
with a convicted felon who created a
 
00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
heinous crime and we had to make a
 
00:14:08.389 --> 00:14:08.399 align:start position:0%
decision whether or not they should get
 
00:14:10.430 --> 00:14:10.440 align:start position:0%
their license that's not going to be in
 
00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:12.720 align:start position:0%
your Matrix
 
00:14:14.990 --> 00:14:15.000 align:start position:0%
I don't want to go into every detail on
 
00:14:16.129 --> 00:14:16.139 align:start position:0%
every single page here because I know
 
00:14:17.090 --> 00:14:17.100 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a subcommittee in
 
00:14:18.530 --> 00:14:18.540 align:start position:0%
two days
 
00:14:21.410 --> 00:14:21.420 align:start position:0%
my opinion is there's been some major
 
00:14:25.730 --> 00:14:25.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:27.480 align:start position:0%
but you can't put everyone in the same
 
00:14:29.569 --> 00:14:29.579 align:start position:0%
category and this bill kind of does that
 
00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:33.120 align:start position:0%
and the same time on page 20 you take
 
00:14:35.930 --> 00:14:35.940 align:start position:0%
away all these rulemaking disciplinary
 
00:14:39.490 --> 00:14:39.500 align:start position:0%
action hearings appeals investigation
 
00:14:43.009 --> 00:14:43.019 align:start position:0%
Authority that is in lines 13 through 21
 
00:14:45.490 --> 00:14:45.500 align:start position:0%
that you want to appeal
 
00:14:47.689 --> 00:14:47.699 align:start position:0%
some of it's just going a little too far
 
00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
for me as a member of the electrician's
 
00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
board so
 
00:14:54.050 --> 00:14:54.060 align:start position:0%
great job by the subcommittee
 
00:14:55.610 --> 00:14:55.620 align:start position:0%
um members of goalie and and everyone
 
00:14:57.650 --> 00:14:57.660 align:start position:0%
else that was on that
 
00:15:00.290 --> 00:15:00.300 align:start position:0%
um great start a lot of good things in
 
00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:03.000 align:start position:0%
here to clean things up but
 
00:15:04.850 --> 00:15:04.860 align:start position:0%
one of the things I've learned here in
 
00:15:08.329 --> 00:15:08.339 align:start position:0%
my in my ninth term as a representative
 
00:15:08.339 --> 00:15:09.230 align:start position:0%
my in my ninth term as a representative
is

00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:09.240 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:10.920 align:start position:0%
to be cautious about going too far
 
00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
because sometimes we do and then we have
 
00:15:14.269 --> 00:15:14.279 align:start position:0%
to repeal it the following year and I
 
00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:15.660 align:start position:0%
just want us to be very cautious with
 
00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:18.829 align:start position:0%
just want us to be very cautious with
this

00:15:18.829 --> 00:15:18.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:20.269 --> 00:15:20.279 align:start position:0%

00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:37.560 align:start position:0%
I'll win it right down to one question
 
00:15:40.189 --> 00:15:40.199 align:start position:0%
because I think to the degree you can be
 
00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
here for the subcommittee on Friday
 
00:15:44.930 --> 00:15:44.940 align:start position:0%

these individual details uh you know
 
00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
under the microscope your expertise
 
00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:52.920 align:start position:0%
could be really helpful and I'm
 
00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:53.880 align:start position:0%
wondering whether you're going to be

well in relation to representative
 
00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:19.800 align:start position:0%
Schmidt's question do you think you will
 
00:16:22.189 --> 00:16:22.199 align:start position:0%
be able to come to our subcommittee
 
00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:24.420 align:start position:0%
meeting Friday morning yes I'll be there
 
00:16:26.930 --> 00:16:26.940 align:start position:0%
thank you oops I'll wait for my
 
00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:28.260 align:start position:0%
questions then
 
00:16:29.689 --> 00:16:29.699 align:start position:0%
yeah you know I understand there's a
 
00:16:31.310 --> 00:16:31.320 align:start position:0%
hearing there's a lot here
 
00:16:33.650 --> 00:16:33.660 align:start position:0%
um I I was daunting when I looked at 77
 
00:16:35.210 --> 00:16:35.220 align:start position:0%
pages and started going through it but a
 
00:16:36.410 --> 00:16:36.420 align:start position:0%
lot of is obviously after the page 20
 
00:16:38.329 --> 00:16:38.339 align:start position:0%
it's not a repeat but
 
00:16:38.339 --> 00:16:39.050 align:start position:0%
it's not a repeat but
um

00:16:39.050 --> 00:16:39.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:40.970 --> 00:16:40.980 align:start position:0%
it's amazing sometimes how one little
 
00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:41.880 align:start position:0%
change and there'll be some people
 
00:16:44.210 --> 00:16:44.220 align:start position:0%
testifying after me one little sentence
 
00:16:46.009 --> 00:16:46.019 align:start position:0%
or two or three little words that I
 
00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:47.160 align:start position:0%
didn't even think of reading it through
 
00:16:49.069 --> 00:16:49.079 align:start position:0%
the first time that have some major
 
00:16:49.079 --> 00:16:51.050 align:start position:0%
the first time that have some major
consequences

00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:51.060 align:start position:0%
consequences
 
00:16:54.290 --> 00:16:54.300 align:start position:0%
um and um so unfortunately it does have
 
00:16:58.310 --> 00:16:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:02.629 --> 00:17:02.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:19.549 --> 00:17:19.559 align:start position:0%
good morning honorable committee members
 
00:17:22.309 --> 00:17:22.319 align:start position:0%
thank you for hearing my testimony
 
00:17:23.870 --> 00:17:23.880 align:start position:0%
um my name is Elizabeth Eaton and I am
 
00:17:26.329 --> 00:17:26.339 align:start position:0%
an attorney at oplc and I'm here on
 
00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:28.140 align:start position:0%
behalf of the board of psychologists
 
00:17:31.850 --> 00:17:31.860 align:start position:0%
today so I'm taking off my oplc hat and
 
00:17:33.650 --> 00:17:33.660 align:start position:0%
won't take questions regarding the
 
00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:36.900 align:start position:0%
agency but I will be testifying on
 
00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:39.240 align:start position:0%
behalf of the board today I have a
 
00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:40.640 align:start position:0%
letter that the board
 
00:17:44.210 --> 00:17:44.220 align:start position:0%
issued and I'll be reading that and I
 
00:17:46.850 --> 00:17:46.860 align:start position:0%
have Dr walrath with me here he is also
 
00:17:49.909 --> 00:17:49.919 align:start position:0%
on the board of psychologists
 
00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
so the letter States
 
00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:52.970 align:start position:0%
so the letter States
um

00:17:52.970 --> 00:17:52.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:54.770 --> 00:17:54.780 align:start position:0%
and it's regarding sections applicable
 
00:17:57.169 --> 00:17:57.179 align:start position:0%
to the board of psychologists
 
00:17:58.850 --> 00:17:58.860 align:start position:0%
the board of psychologists understands
 
00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:00.720 align:start position:0%
that an efficient consolidation of
 
00:18:02.330 --> 00:18:02.340 align:start position:0%
administration will be a positive
 
00:18:04.669 --> 00:18:04.679 align:start position:0%
direction for the Department yet the
 
00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
board is very concerned that the
 
00:18:08.270 --> 00:18:08.280 align:start position:0%
statutory changes proposed in the new
 
00:18:10.850 --> 00:18:10.860 align:start position:0%
oplc bill will greatly diminish the
 
00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:12.600 align:start position:0%
effectiveness of the board the
 
00:18:15.110 --> 00:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
protection of the public and fairness to
 
00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:17.640 align:start position:0%
the occupations of the psychologists it
 
00:18:20.210 --> 00:18:20.220 align:start position:0%
regulates the board sees many problems
 
00:18:22.549 --> 00:18:22.559 align:start position:0%
with this bill and strongly urges the
 
00:18:24.409 --> 00:18:24.419 align:start position:0%
committee to retain the bill in
 
00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
committee to study the bill so that many
 
00:18:28.850 --> 00:18:28.860 align:start position:0%
details that are harmful can be known
 
00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:31.260 align:start position:0%
and resolved before sending it to any
 
00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:33.360 align:start position:0%
further action in the house
 
00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:35.640 align:start position:0%
below are just some of the major areas
 
00:18:38.090 --> 00:18:38.100 align:start position:0%
of our grave concerns about the bill
 
00:18:40.370 --> 00:18:40.380 align:start position:0%
we hope that the details of these and
 
00:18:42.529 --> 00:18:42.539 align:start position:0%
our other issues could be discussed in
 
00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:44.760 align:start position:0%
detail along with our other professions
 
00:18:46.909 --> 00:18:46.919 align:start position:0%
as your committee could keep and study
 
00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:47.880 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:18:50.210 --> 00:18:50.220 align:start position:0%
while the board wishes to cooperate with
 
00:18:53.029 --> 00:18:53.039 align:start position:0%
consolidating administrative supports it
 
00:18:54.289 --> 00:18:54.299 align:start position:0%
is seriously concerned about the
 
00:18:55.730 --> 00:18:55.740 align:start position:0%
eliminations in the bill that would
 
00:18:57.289 --> 00:18:57.299 align:start position:0%
seriously affect the well-being of
 
00:18:59.630 --> 00:18:59.640 align:start position:0%
patients and the due process of the
 
00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:01.010 align:start position:0%
patients and the due process of the
board

00:19:01.010 --> 00:19:01.020 align:start position:0%
board
 
00:19:02.930 --> 00:19:02.940 align:start position:0%
So Below I'm gonna
 
00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
elaborate on some of the issues that the
 
00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:07.980 align:start position:0%
board has the bill eliminates an
 
00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:10.260 align:start position:0%
important protection to the individual's
 
00:19:14.090 --> 00:19:14.100 align:start position:0%
private medical records in the repeal of
 
00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:19.080 align:start position:0%
RSA 329b 22 6. this important privacy
 
00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
protection safeguards the privacy of
 
00:19:23.930 --> 00:19:23.940 align:start position:0%
medical records in the process of
 
00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:25.860 align:start position:0%
Investigations when the person
 
00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:28.320 align:start position:0%
complaining is not the patient and does
 
00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:32.340 align:start position:0%
not have the right to share the records
 
00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:34.440 align:start position:0%
another section the bill repeals an
 
00:19:35.890 --> 00:19:35.900 align:start position:0%
important part of due process
 
00:19:38.810 --> 00:19:38.820 align:start position:0%
eliminating the summary of findings from
 
00:19:41.029 --> 00:19:41.039 align:start position:0%
an investigation that currently is
 
00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:43.200 align:start position:0%
shared with the licensee before facing
 
00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:45.480 align:start position:0%
settlement a step which gives a licensee
 
00:19:47.570 --> 00:19:47.580 align:start position:0%
a review of the facts that have been
 
00:19:50.210 --> 00:19:50.220 align:start position:0%
assembled against them the bill repeals
 
00:19:54.890 --> 00:19:54.900 align:start position:0%
RSA 329b 22 9 which provides this Fair
 
00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
due process
 
00:20:01.370 --> 00:20:01.380 align:start position:0%
the bill also repeals RSA 329 B 22 8
 
00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
that requires the immediate notification
 
00:20:07.010 --> 00:20:07.020 align:start position:0%
of an allegation sending the copy to the
 
00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:08.150 align:start position:0%
of an allegation sending the copy to the
licensee

00:20:08.150 --> 00:20:08.160 align:start position:0%
licensee
 
00:20:10.490 --> 00:20:10.500 align:start position:0%
the board sees the value of informing
 
00:20:12.350 --> 00:20:12.360 align:start position:0%
the psychologist because it protects the
 
00:20:14.450 --> 00:20:14.460 align:start position:0%
public and brings immediate awareness to
 
00:20:16.130 --> 00:20:16.140 align:start position:0%
the doctor of the issues that offended
 
00:20:19.490 --> 00:20:19.500 align:start position:0%
the alleger especially important in
 
00:20:22.610 --> 00:20:22.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:26.950 --> 00:20:26.960 align:start position:0%
the bill also repeals RSA 329 B 2210
 
00:20:29.570 --> 00:20:29.580 align:start position:0%
which will lose the distinction between
 
00:20:31.850 --> 00:20:31.860 align:start position:0%
the status of an allegation versus a
 
00:20:33.770 --> 00:20:33.780 align:start position:0%
complaint which is a very important
 
00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:36.480 align:start position:0%
Safeguard of our boards statutes and
 
00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:37.370 align:start position:0%
Safeguard of our boards statutes and
process

00:20:37.370 --> 00:20:37.380 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:20:39.710 --> 00:20:39.720 align:start position:0%
only after the board has determined that
 
00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
an allegation could violate practice
 
00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
laws it is elevated to be a complaint
 
00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:48.240 align:start position:0%
and then it is formally investigated
 
00:20:51.169 --> 00:20:51.179 align:start position:0%
under current law the allegation which
 
00:20:53.450 --> 00:20:53.460 align:start position:0%
is the first communication to the
 
00:20:56.090 --> 00:20:56.100 align:start position:0%
department is completely confidential in
 
00:20:58.430 --> 00:20:58.440 align:start position:0%
all respects being protected in statute
 
00:21:00.169 --> 00:21:00.179 align:start position:0%
from reporting by the licensee
 
00:21:01.669 --> 00:21:01.679 align:start position:0%
practicing their occupation of
 
00:21:01.679 --> 00:21:03.230 align:start position:0%

00:21:05.990 --> 00:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
once it becomes a complaint if
 
00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
reportable in the doctor's
 
00:21:11.210 --> 00:21:11.220 align:start position:0%
professional accountability it is
 
00:21:12.590 --> 00:21:12.600 align:start position:0%
reportable in the doctor's professional

practice associations
 
00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:18.720 align:start position:0%
finally the board of psychologist hopes
 
00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:20.520 align:start position:0%
to be helpful in the process of making
 
00:21:22.610 --> 00:21:22.620 align:start position:0%
the department streamlined but also
 
00:21:25.789 --> 00:21:25.799 align:start position:0%
effective in protecting the public and
 
00:21:27.350 --> 00:21:27.360 align:start position:0%
In fairness to the individuals
 
00:21:29.450 --> 00:21:29.460 align:start position:0%
practicing their occupations
 
00:21:31.970 --> 00:21:31.980 align:start position:0%
the board requests that you retain the
 
00:21:33.529 --> 00:21:33.539 align:start position:0%
billing committee so that we and others
 
00:21:35.870 --> 00:21:35.880 align:start position:0%
can facilitate the reconciliation of
 
00:21:38.210 --> 00:21:38.220 align:start position:0%
these issues for Better Health boards
 
00:21:40.010 --> 00:21:40.020 align:start position:0%
safer practice and fairness to the
 
00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:42.649 align:start position:0%
safer practice and fairness to the
occupations

00:21:42.649 --> 00:21:42.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:44.210 --> 00:21:44.220 align:start position:0%

okay while wrath can also help me answer
 
00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:52.880 align:start position:0%

00:21:59.390 --> 00:21:59.400 align:start position:0%
already been alluded to this bill is
 
00:22:01.909 --> 00:22:01.919 align:start position:0%
going to subcommittee uh where we can
 
00:22:04.370 --> 00:22:04.380 align:start position:0%
get into the these details and try to
 
00:22:07.730 --> 00:22:07.740 align:start position:0%
work them out uh so are you are you or
 
00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:09.840 align:start position:0%

00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:14.760 align:start position:0%
task on Friday
 
00:22:16.190 --> 00:22:16.200 align:start position:0%
um personally I have to look at my
 
00:22:17.630 --> 00:22:17.640 align:start position:0%
calendar as I'm representing other
 
00:22:20.450 --> 00:22:20.460 align:start position:0%
boards in front of committees I would
 
00:22:23.450 --> 00:22:23.460 align:start position:0%
if I can be there I will
 
00:22:25.430 --> 00:22:25.440 align:start position:0%
I'll certainly make every effort to be
 
00:22:27.529 --> 00:22:27.539 align:start position:0%
there right now I have some conflicts
 
00:22:29.710 --> 00:22:29.720 align:start position:0%
but I think I can work those out
 
00:22:34.010 --> 00:22:34.020 align:start position:0%
follow-up so uh you you I'm speaking now
 
00:22:35.570 --> 00:22:35.580 align:start position:0%

00:22:42.770 --> 00:22:42.780 align:start position:0%
the details of issues that you have a
 
00:22:46.490 --> 00:22:46.500 align:start position:0%
problem with so the question is uh how
 
00:22:47.770 --> 00:22:47.780 align:start position:0%
we can
 
00:22:50.390 --> 00:22:50.400 align:start position:0%
other than just striking that particular
 
00:22:53.690 --> 00:22:53.700 align:start position:0%
section of the bill getting at it is is
 
00:22:56.570 --> 00:22:56.580 align:start position:0%
going to require some kind of a list to
 
00:22:58.730 --> 00:22:58.740 align:start position:0%

00:23:15.409 --> 00:23:15.419 align:start position:0%

within within this bill
 
00:23:38.330 --> 00:23:38.340 align:start position:0%
um during its creation during the
 
00:23:40.669 --> 00:23:40.679 align:start position:0%
process of it were the boards
 
00:23:43.310 --> 00:23:43.320 align:start position:0%
um invited into the conversation
 
00:23:48.049 --> 00:23:48.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:48.059 --> 00:23:49.370 align:start position:0%
 
sure

00:23:49.370 --> 00:23:49.380 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:51.360 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm not aware of that that hasn't
 
00:23:53.330 --> 00:23:53.340 align:start position:0%

00:23:56.390 --> 00:23:56.400 align:start position:0%
meetings okay very good
 
00:24:03.049 --> 00:24:03.059 align:start position:0%

00:24:30.179 --> 00:24:31.909 align:start position:0%
 
morning

00:24:31.909 --> 00:24:31.919 align:start position:0%

not yet good morning I'm Mike Porter I'm
 
00:24:37.850 --> 00:24:37.860 align:start position:0%
the investigations bureau chief uh oplc
 
00:24:41.390 --> 00:24:41.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:43.310 --> 00:24:43.320 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr Vice chair and members
 
00:24:44.330 --> 00:24:44.340 align:start position:0%
of the committee my name is Douglas
 
00:24:46.430 --> 00:24:46.440 align:start position:0%
osterhau and I am currently general
 
00:24:49.250 --> 00:24:49.260 align:start position:0%
counsel for oplc executive director
 
00:24:52.070 --> 00:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
Courtney uh gives your apologies for not
 
00:24:53.330 --> 00:24:53.340 align:start position:0%
being able to be here today she's
 
00:24:55.669 --> 00:24:55.679 align:start position:0%
currently back on her way back from
 
00:24:57.770 --> 00:24:57.780 align:start position:0%
Washington D.C but she will be at the
 
00:25:01.730 --> 00:25:01.740 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meeting on Friday as will I
 
00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:03.360 align:start position:0%
um so I do have the ability to answer
 
00:25:05.630 --> 00:25:05.640 align:start position:0%
questions today but just so everyone's
 
00:25:08.149 --> 00:25:08.159 align:start position:0%
aware I'll be at both
 
00:25:10.190 --> 00:25:10.200 align:start position:0%
um I think representative McGuire did an
 
00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:12.240 align:start position:0%
excellent job of sort of presenting the
 
00:25:15.169 --> 00:25:15.179 align:start position:0%
bill oplc does not take a position on
 
00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
the bill we were actively involved in
 
00:25:21.409 --> 00:25:21.419 align:start position:0%
the SB 330 study committee that occurred
 
00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:24.360 align:start position:0%
last year we were asked at the end of
 
00:25:27.909 --> 00:25:27.919 align:start position:0%
that study committee to propose language
 
00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:30.120 align:start position:0%
at the that would meet the
 
00:25:32.029 --> 00:25:32.039 align:start position:0%
recommendations of that subcommittee so
 
00:25:34.490 --> 00:25:34.500 align:start position:0%
I do have some of those listed today
 
00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
um but I think we've heard a lot of
 
00:25:37.850 --> 00:25:37.860 align:start position:0%
those already it was the main point of
 
00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:39.360 align:start position:0%
that was to carve out sort of
 
00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:42.240 align:start position:0%
responsibilities between the boards and
 
00:25:45.049 --> 00:25:45.059 align:start position:0%
between the oplc and a lot of that came
 
00:25:49.549 --> 00:25:49.559 align:start position:0%
down to who would process licenses I
 
00:25:52.010 --> 00:25:52.020 align:start position:0%
think there's a lot of concerns and I
 
00:25:53.810 --> 00:25:53.820 align:start position:0%
can I can either address things today or
 
00:25:55.669 --> 00:25:55.679 align:start position:0%
we can wait till Friday I think that's
 
00:25:57.529 --> 00:25:57.539 align:start position:0%
sort of
 
00:25:59.570 --> 00:25:59.580 align:start position:0%
a little guidance as to how you would
 
00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:01.080 align:start position:0%
like me approach
 
00:26:02.570 --> 00:26:02.580 align:start position:0%
I think for the most part we'll leave
 
00:26:04.730 --> 00:26:04.740 align:start position:0%
the larger detail for the Friday
 
00:26:06.470 --> 00:26:06.480 align:start position:0%
subcommittee yeah I think that's where a
 
00:26:09.049 --> 00:26:09.059 align:start position:0%
lot of that will happen Okay so so then
 
00:26:11.810 --> 00:26:11.820 align:start position:0%
just the the broad overview then
 
00:26:14.870 --> 00:26:14.880 align:start position:0%
um we carved out the sort of discipline
 
00:26:16.909 --> 00:26:16.919 align:start position:0%
in process but the administrative side
 
00:26:16.919 --> 00:26:18.890 align:start position:0%
in process but the administrative side
so

00:26:18.890 --> 00:26:18.900 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
um Council for individuals hearings
 
00:26:24.049 --> 00:26:24.059 align:start position:0%
officers when investigations could be
 
00:26:26.450 --> 00:26:26.460 align:start position:0%
triggered previously every if we were to
 
00:26:27.950 --> 00:26:27.960 align:start position:0%
receive a complaint an investigation
 
00:26:29.690 --> 00:26:29.700 align:start position:0%
would need to go before the board we
 
00:26:32.870 --> 00:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
would need authority to investigate and
 
00:26:34.450 --> 00:26:34.460 align:start position:0%
this is just one example
 
00:26:36.890 --> 00:26:36.900 align:start position:0%
oftentimes depending on when a complaint
 
00:26:40.370 --> 00:26:40.380 align:start position:0%
would come in there could be
 
00:26:42.110 --> 00:26:42.120 align:start position:0%
significant delay in actually
 
00:26:44.210 --> 00:26:44.220 align:start position:0%
investigating this just does things like
 
00:26:46.669 --> 00:26:46.679 align:start position:0%
give the oplc the authority to begin
 
00:26:48.950 --> 00:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
investigations immediately as soon as a
 
00:26:51.950 --> 00:26:51.960 align:start position:0%
complaint comes up the the overall
 
00:26:54.230 --> 00:26:54.240 align:start position:0%
arching theme of this entire bill is
 
00:26:57.529 --> 00:26:57.539 align:start position:0%
oplc controls the process right
 
00:26:59.870 --> 00:26:59.880 align:start position:0%
licensing applications come in we're
 
00:27:01.970 --> 00:27:01.980 align:start position:0%
able to process applications if there's
 
00:27:04.669 --> 00:27:04.679 align:start position:0%
any difficulty if there's any denials if
 
00:27:07.909 --> 00:27:07.919 align:start position:0%
there's any discretion those things go
 
00:27:10.430 --> 00:27:10.440 align:start position:0%
before the board complaints come in we
 
00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:12.240 align:start position:0%
review those complaints in the first
 
00:27:14.210 --> 00:27:14.220 align:start position:0%
instance we're able to investigate them
 
00:27:16.730 --> 00:27:16.740 align:start position:0%
we make recommendations to the boards
 
00:27:18.769 --> 00:27:18.779 align:start position:0%
the boards still retain the authority to
 
00:27:20.450 --> 00:27:20.460 align:start position:0%
make the decision on whether to proceed
 
00:27:22.850 --> 00:27:22.860 align:start position:0%
with discipline they still have the
 
00:27:25.549 --> 00:27:25.559 align:start position:0%
authority to hear the case and decide if
 
00:27:26.930 --> 00:27:26.940 align:start position:0%
discipline is appropriate they still
 
00:27:30.710 --> 00:27:30.720 align:start position:0%
have the abort authority to make the
 
00:27:32.570 --> 00:27:32.580 align:start position:0%
sanctions that that's all in their
 
00:27:34.789 --> 00:27:34.799 align:start position:0%
control still other things that are
 
00:27:36.950 --> 00:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
still in their control the license might
 
00:27:38.990 --> 00:27:39.000 align:start position:0%
come into us we might do the criminal
 
00:27:41.330 --> 00:27:41.340 align:start position:0%
background check the board words still
 
00:27:43.810 --> 00:27:43.820 align:start position:0%
have the authority to set criteria
 
00:27:47.390 --> 00:27:47.400 align:start position:0%
for what what needs to be contained in
 
00:27:50.570 --> 00:27:50.580 align:start position:0%
the application the type of education
 
00:27:53.149 --> 00:27:53.159 align:start position:0%
that's necessary the kind of in on the
 
00:27:55.430 --> 00:27:55.440 align:start position:0%
field training those sorts of things all
 
00:27:57.590 --> 00:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
that criteria still
 
00:28:00.529 --> 00:28:00.539 align:start position:0%
set by the board word processing the
 
00:28:02.930 --> 00:28:02.940 align:start position:0%
license as administrative function
 
00:28:04.669 --> 00:28:04.679 align:start position:0%
so these are the types of changes there
 
00:28:10.130 --> 00:28:10.140 align:start position:0%
was mention of a non-lapsing fund at
 
00:28:11.990 --> 00:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
it's currently at the end of the
 
00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:15.360 align:start position:0%
biennium oplc any funds uh will lapse
 
00:28:16.909 --> 00:28:16.919 align:start position:0%
into the general fund it was the
 
00:28:19.549 --> 00:28:19.559 align:start position:0%
recommendation of the subcommittee that
 
00:28:22.250 --> 00:28:22.260 align:start position:0%
the funds oplc being a self-funded
 
00:28:24.110 --> 00:28:24.120 align:start position:0%
agency our money comes from the
 
00:28:26.930 --> 00:28:26.940 align:start position:0%
licensees and the belief was that money
 
00:28:29.870 --> 00:28:29.880 align:start position:0%
should be spent on the licensees so the
 
00:28:32.870 --> 00:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing fund was created or was
 
00:28:36.230 --> 00:28:36.240 align:start position:0%
proposed in an effort to keep that money
 
00:28:38.390 --> 00:28:38.400 align:start position:0%
where it should be hopefully lower costs
 
00:28:40.430 --> 00:28:40.440 align:start position:0%
because we aren't resetting back to zero
 
00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
every two years and then also allow us
 
00:28:45.669 --> 00:28:45.679 align:start position:0%
to retain some money for
 
00:28:48.830 --> 00:28:48.840 align:start position:0%
basic functions maintaining laptops new
 
00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
desks the sort of regular the
 
00:28:54.890 --> 00:28:54.900 align:start position:0%
requirements of an agency
 
00:28:54.900 --> 00:29:01.850 align:start position:0%
requirements of an agency
um

00:29:01.850 --> 00:29:01.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:05.390 --> 00:29:05.400 align:start position:0%
I think a lot of the
 
00:29:07.070 --> 00:29:07.080 align:start position:0%
other information that I could present
 
00:29:08.930 --> 00:29:08.940 align:start position:0%
to you today would be probably more
 
00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:12.360 align:start position:0%
appropriate for Friday I do have
 
00:29:16.370 --> 00:29:16.380 align:start position:0%
responses to the board of psychology's
 
00:29:19.430 --> 00:29:19.440 align:start position:0%
letter written testimony today I also
 
00:29:21.049 --> 00:29:21.059 align:start position:0%
provided before the hearing started
 
00:29:23.330 --> 00:29:23.340 align:start position:0%
written testimony everyone should have
 
00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:25.140 align:start position:0%
received a copy of that from the
 
00:29:27.830 --> 00:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
executive director sort of explaining
 
00:29:31.310 --> 00:29:31.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:33.769 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:29:33.769 --> 00:29:33.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:35.630 --> 00:29:35.640 align:start position:0%
so we are we are here to answer
 
00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
questions if you have any and uh again
 
00:29:42.289 --> 00:29:42.299 align:start position:0%
we will be present Friday
 
00:29:44.029 --> 00:29:44.039 align:start position:0%
um great before we do thought would you
 
00:29:45.710 --> 00:29:45.720 align:start position:0%
mind just giving some brief responses to
 
00:29:47.510 --> 00:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
the board of psychology it would give us
 
00:29:49.190 --> 00:29:49.200 align:start position:0%
a sense I think of potential other
 
00:29:50.450 --> 00:29:50.460 align:start position:0%
conflicts that will come if we won't
 
00:29:52.310 --> 00:29:52.320 align:start position:0%
have to go into every group in detail
 
00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:53.450 align:start position:0%
have to go into every group in detail
but

00:29:53.450 --> 00:29:53.460 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:29:55.610 --> 00:29:55.620 align:start position:0%
absolutely some rationale for why
 
00:29:57.590 --> 00:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
certain things were repealed would be
 
00:29:57.600 --> 00:30:00.110 align:start position:0%
certain things were repealed would be
helpful

00:30:00.110 --> 00:30:00.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:03.110 --> 00:30:03.120 align:start position:0%
so I I know you don't have
 
00:30:06.769 --> 00:30:06.779 align:start position:0%
a copy of the boards written testimony
 
00:30:09.769 --> 00:30:09.779 align:start position:0%
in front of you but essentially
 
00:30:09.779 --> 00:30:10.610 align:start position:0%
in front of you but essentially
um

00:30:10.610 --> 00:30:10.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:12.590 --> 00:30:12.600 align:start position:0%
I was attorney Eaton went through and
 
00:30:14.450 --> 00:30:14.460 align:start position:0%
read the four bullet points I had
 
00:30:16.669 --> 00:30:16.679 align:start position:0%
responses to the four bullet points so
 
00:30:18.830 --> 00:30:18.840 align:start position:0%
bullet point one reference privacy and
 
00:30:22.970 --> 00:30:22.980 align:start position:0%

00:30:25.490 --> 00:30:25.500 align:start position:0%

00:30:30.049 --> 00:30:30.059 align:start position:0%

00:30:33.350 --> 00:30:33.360 align:start position:0%

00:30:35.389 --> 00:30:35.399 align:start position:0%

00:30:48.830 --> 00:30:48.840 align:start position:0%
requirements under RSA 91a and then it
 
00:30:50.149 --> 00:30:50.159 align:start position:0%
goes on unless such information
 
00:30:52.549 --> 00:30:52.559 align:start position:0%
subsequently becomes part of a hearing
 
00:30:55.610 --> 00:30:55.620 align:start position:0%

necessary to make a recommendation as to
 
00:33:16.850 --> 00:33:16.860 align:start position:0%
whether further action should be taken

based on the allegation
 
00:33:21.950 --> 00:33:21.960 align:start position:0%
in question the practice of the lplc is
 
00:33:24.350 --> 00:33:24.360 align:start position:0%
when a complaint is received one of the
 
00:33:26.930 --> 00:33:26.940 align:start position:0%
first things we do in a typical case is
 
00:33:28.850 --> 00:33:28.860 align:start position:0%
to reach out to the subject of the
 
00:33:31.250 --> 00:33:31.260 align:start position:0%
complaint and ask for a response there
 
00:33:33.889 --> 00:33:33.899 align:start position:0%
may be situations here and there where
 
00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:36.960 align:start position:0%
at the request of a law enforcement
 
00:33:39.710 --> 00:33:39.720 align:start position:0%
agency we hold back but that is standard
 
00:33:41.930 --> 00:33:41.940 align:start position:0%
practice that's that's how it works and
 
00:33:45.470 --> 00:33:45.480 align:start position:0%
it's in rule and then the final bullet
 
00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:46.250 align:start position:0%
it's in rule and then the final bullet
um

00:33:46.250 --> 00:33:46.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:50.389 --> 00:33:50.399 align:start position:0%
Bill repeals 329 b22x
 
00:33:52.490 --> 00:33:52.500 align:start position:0%
um which will lose the distinction
 
00:33:54.590 --> 00:33:54.600 align:start position:0%
between a status of an allegation versus
 
00:33:59.149 --> 00:33:59.159 align:start position:0%
a complaint RSA 31094 which is in the
 
00:34:02.450 --> 00:34:02.460 align:start position:0%
bill page 7 line 34.
 
00:34:04.490 --> 00:34:04.500 align:start position:0%
allegations of misconduct received by
 
00:34:06.230 --> 00:34:06.240 align:start position:0%
the office information and Records
 
00:34:07.669 --> 00:34:07.679 align:start position:0%
acquired by the office during an
 
00:34:07.679 --> 00:34:09.349 align:start position:0%
acquired by the office during an
investigation

00:34:09.349 --> 00:34:09.359 align:start position:0%
investigation
 
00:34:11.210 --> 00:34:11.220 align:start position:0%
and reports and Records made by the
 
00:34:12.829 --> 00:34:12.839 align:start position:0%
office because of its investigation
 
00:34:15.950 --> 00:34:15.960 align:start position:0%
shall be held confidential it's the same
 
00:34:19.550 --> 00:34:19.560 align:start position:0%
it is the same logic or languages before
 
00:34:21.050 --> 00:34:21.060 align:start position:0%
that I already cited so I'm not going to
 
00:34:25.909 --> 00:34:25.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:25.919 --> 00:34:27.050 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:34:27.050 --> 00:34:27.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:29.810 --> 00:34:29.820 align:start position:0%
but from the office's perspective the
 
00:34:31.849 --> 00:34:31.859 align:start position:0%
complaint is is just the vessel through
 
00:34:33.589 --> 00:34:33.599 align:start position:0%
which the allegation right a complaint
 
00:34:35.690 --> 00:34:35.700 align:start position:0%
is the form the allegation is on that
 
00:34:38.450 --> 00:34:38.460 align:start position:0%
form we aren't making the distinction at
 
00:34:40.849 --> 00:34:40.859 align:start position:0%
the lplc between the complaint and the
 
00:34:42.889 --> 00:34:42.899 align:start position:0%
allegation we don't see there being a
 
00:34:44.510 --> 00:34:44.520 align:start position:0%
functional distinction between a
 
00:34:46.129 --> 00:34:46.139 align:start position:0%
complaint and an allegation other than
 
00:34:48.349 --> 00:34:48.359 align:start position:0%
one might be a piece of paperwork one is
 
00:34:50.349 --> 00:34:50.359 align:start position:0%
the words on that piece of paper
 
00:34:53.810 --> 00:34:53.820 align:start position:0%
so we don't hopefully these answers
 
00:34:55.430 --> 00:34:55.440 align:start position:0%
alleviate some of the concerns we're
 
00:34:58.670 --> 00:34:58.680 align:start position:0%
very concerned about the confidentiality
 
00:35:00.290 --> 00:35:00.300 align:start position:0%
of our records we're very concerned
 
00:35:02.870 --> 00:35:02.880 align:start position:0%
about the privacy of the citizens of New
 
00:35:04.670 --> 00:35:04.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and these things we believe
 
00:35:07.970 --> 00:35:07.980 align:start position:0%
have been approached in the proposed
 
00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:09.710 align:start position:0%
have been approached in the proposed
language

00:35:09.710 --> 00:35:09.720 align:start position:0%
language
 
00:35:12.410 --> 00:35:12.420 align:start position:0%
uh so that's what I had for the board of
 
00:35:15.109 --> 00:35:15.119 align:start position:0%
psychology you are representative Simon
 
00:35:17.450 --> 00:35:17.460 align:start position:0%
Vice chair also had a question about
 
00:35:20.210 --> 00:35:20.220 align:start position:0%
were the boards given an opportunity to
 
00:35:23.210 --> 00:35:23.220 align:start position:0%
get uh the public hearing SB 330 it was
 
00:35:25.430 --> 00:35:25.440 align:start position:0%
public many members of boards did come
 
00:35:27.770 --> 00:35:27.780 align:start position:0%
and testify before that uh study
 
00:35:29.390 --> 00:35:29.400 align:start position:0%
committing last year and had an
 
00:35:32.450 --> 00:35:32.460 align:start position:0%
opportunity to provide input into
 
00:35:32.460 --> 00:35:33.230 align:start position:0%
opportunity to provide input into
um

00:35:33.230 --> 00:35:33.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:35.450 --> 00:35:35.460 align:start position:0%
into sort of the final product
 
00:35:37.370 --> 00:35:37.380 align:start position:0%
so and the recommendations that came out
 
00:35:38.450 --> 00:35:38.460 align:start position:0%
of the board
 
00:35:42.530 --> 00:35:42.540 align:start position:0%
great yes representative Schmidt
 
00:35:44.810 --> 00:35:44.820 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:35:47.990 --> 00:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
perhaps I can I'm very appreciative of
 
00:35:49.849 --> 00:35:49.859 align:start position:0%
the testimony you've offered up to this
 
00:35:50.990 --> 00:35:51.000 align:start position:0%
point and I know you're going to be
 
00:35:54.109 --> 00:35:54.119 align:start position:0%
available on Friday but perhaps when we
 
00:35:55.790 --> 00:35:55.800 align:start position:0%
where we have the whole committee here
 
00:35:58.130 --> 00:35:58.140 align:start position:0%
and also a number of practitioners in
 
00:36:01.310 --> 00:36:01.320 align:start position:0%
their uh their uh board members and so
 
00:36:03.530 --> 00:36:03.540 align:start position:0%
forth perhaps I can drill down into one
 
00:36:05.030 --> 00:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
thing that that I think will be
 
00:36:07.609 --> 00:36:07.619 align:start position:0%
understandable uh to the to the group
 
00:36:11.390 --> 00:36:11.400 align:start position:0%
even if this is a first uh investigation
 
00:36:14.630 --> 00:36:14.640 align:start position:0%
of this sort that they've done and I was
 
00:36:16.790 --> 00:36:16.800 align:start position:0%
part of a subcommittee about I don't
 
00:36:19.370 --> 00:36:19.380 align:start position:0%
know 10 or 12 years ago that involved
 
00:36:21.550 --> 00:36:21.560 align:start position:0%
former representative Neil Kirk
 
00:36:24.470 --> 00:36:24.480 align:start position:0%
and former Attorney General Sarah
 
00:36:26.810 --> 00:36:26.820 align:start position:0%
Blodgett representation we have a ton of
 
00:36:28.130 --> 00:36:28.140 align:start position:0%
pink cards so if we could get to the
 
00:36:29.870 --> 00:36:29.880 align:start position:0%
question quickly okay here comes the
 
00:36:33.710 --> 00:36:33.720 align:start position:0%
question so uh the the the the the issue
 
00:36:36.410 --> 00:36:36.420 align:start position:0%
it at hand at that particular time was
 
00:36:39.829 --> 00:36:39.839 align:start position:0%
the privacy of individual patients
 
00:36:39.839 --> 00:36:41.470 align:start position:0%
the privacy of individual patients
Records

00:36:41.470 --> 00:36:41.480 align:start position:0%
Records
 
00:36:45.890 --> 00:36:45.900 align:start position:0%
who have seen psychologists or other
 
00:36:48.950 --> 00:36:48.960 align:start position:0%
mental health practitioners and it was
 
00:36:51.650 --> 00:36:51.660 align:start position:0%
recognized in this and the statute was
 
00:36:55.849 --> 00:36:55.859 align:start position:0%
amended to bring in the idea that these
 
00:36:59.150 --> 00:36:59.160 align:start position:0%
records uh needed to be absolutely
 
00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:02.640 align:start position:0%
secure and they could not be made
 
00:37:07.130 --> 00:37:07.140 align:start position:0%
available uh in a large scale for some
 
00:37:08.329 --> 00:37:08.339 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
00:37:11.270 --> 00:37:11.280 align:start position:0%
I don't want to call it data mining but
 
00:37:13.730 --> 00:37:13.740 align:start position:0%
if you if you if you were after a
 
00:37:17.650 --> 00:37:17.660 align:start position:0%
psychologist perhaps for a
 
00:37:20.390 --> 00:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
billing violation
 
00:37:22.790 --> 00:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
you didn't really have to see that that
 
00:37:26.329 --> 00:37:26.339 align:start position:0%
the records of the patient uh their
 
00:37:26.339 --> 00:37:28.089 align:start position:0%
the records of the patient uh their
actual

00:37:28.089 --> 00:37:28.099 align:start position:0%
actual
 
00:37:31.190 --> 00:37:31.200 align:start position:0%
consultation with the psychologist and
 
00:37:33.170 --> 00:37:33.180 align:start position:0%
the idea that that potentially is going
 
00:37:35.690 --> 00:37:35.700 align:start position:0%
to be repealed here is very troubling to
 
00:37:38.510 --> 00:37:38.520 align:start position:0%
me because the people go to mental
 
00:37:41.329 --> 00:37:41.339 align:start position:0%
health practitioners obviously for uh
 
00:37:43.970 --> 00:37:43.980 align:start position:0%
for consultation with regard to their
 
00:37:46.910 --> 00:37:46.920 align:start position:0%
deepest issues and problems that cannot
 
00:37:49.730 --> 00:37:49.740 align:start position:0%
be available to the to anyone other than
 
00:37:52.010 --> 00:37:52.020 align:start position:0%
that psychologist and the patient in my
 
00:37:56.450 --> 00:37:56.460 align:start position:0%
view so this proposed repeal how it will
 
00:38:00.730 --> 00:38:00.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:04.069 --> 00:38:04.079 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for your question so right
 
00:38:06.290 --> 00:38:06.300 align:start position:0%
now every every piece of paper that we
 
00:38:07.910 --> 00:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
receive during an investigation an
 
00:38:09.829 --> 00:38:09.839 align:start position:0%
ongoing active investigation is held
 
00:38:09.839 --> 00:38:11.750 align:start position:0%
ongoing active investigation is held
confidential

00:38:11.750 --> 00:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
confidential
 
00:38:14.690 --> 00:38:14.700 align:start position:0%
if the matter reaches a level of
 
00:38:17.270 --> 00:38:17.280 align:start position:0%
adjudication where the board has
 
00:38:20.210 --> 00:38:20.220 align:start position:0%
determined that this matter needs to be
 
00:38:22.210 --> 00:38:22.220 align:start position:0%
heard before the board
 
00:38:25.130 --> 00:38:25.140 align:start position:0%
aspects certain aspects of those records
 
00:38:27.650 --> 00:38:27.660 align:start position:0%
would become public but I also want to
 
00:38:31.370 --> 00:38:31.380 align:start position:0%
say that for and I'll use juveniles for
 
00:38:34.130 --> 00:38:34.140 align:start position:0%
example juveniles or sexual assault
 
00:38:36.530 --> 00:38:36.540 align:start position:0%
victims and so forth those can be heard
 
00:38:38.810 --> 00:38:38.820 align:start position:0%
and non-public there are certain
 
00:38:41.390 --> 00:38:41.400 align:start position:0%
documents that would remain sealed as
 
00:38:44.270 --> 00:38:44.280 align:start position:0%
part of the record the respondent the
 
00:38:46.550 --> 00:38:46.560 align:start position:0%
licensee who's been charged would have
 
00:38:48.170 --> 00:38:48.180 align:start position:0%
access to review it to prepare their
 
00:38:50.870 --> 00:38:50.880 align:start position:0%
defense for due process purposes but at
 
00:38:52.490 --> 00:38:52.500 align:start position:0%
the end of the day every document we
 
00:38:56.390 --> 00:38:56.400 align:start position:0%
receive is held under confidentiality
 
00:38:59.690 --> 00:38:59.700 align:start position:0%
part of an investigation that that and
 
00:39:01.670 --> 00:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
we run into this with with attorneys uh
 
00:39:03.770 --> 00:39:03.780 align:start position:0%
all the time defense counsel or when
 
00:39:06.230 --> 00:39:06.240 align:start position:0%
we're trying to subpoena records
 
00:39:08.329 --> 00:39:08.339 align:start position:0%
um oftentimes they require a subpoena
 
00:39:11.990 --> 00:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
under HIPAA and then they will determine
 
00:39:15.050 --> 00:39:15.060 align:start position:0%
the records that need to be sent and and
 
00:39:17.030 --> 00:39:17.040 align:start position:0%
sometimes we have you know spirited
 
00:39:19.069 --> 00:39:19.079 align:start position:0%
conversations on those
 
00:39:21.290 --> 00:39:21.300 align:start position:0%
um but records that we receive from
 
00:39:23.170 --> 00:39:23.180 align:start position:0%
Health Care Providers are held to the
 
00:39:26.150 --> 00:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
strictest of confidentiality and even
 
00:39:27.829 --> 00:39:27.839 align:start position:0%
during the hearing process at times
 
00:39:29.810 --> 00:39:29.820 align:start position:0%
boards will go into non-public even
 
00:39:31.730 --> 00:39:31.740 align:start position:0%
during a public hearing to discuss
 
00:39:33.890 --> 00:39:33.900 align:start position:0%
sensitive information that is ongoing
 
00:39:37.490 --> 00:39:37.500 align:start position:0%
now we had a medical case we had a
 
00:39:38.990 --> 00:39:39.000 align:start position:0%
um a couple of medical cases couple
 
00:39:41.150 --> 00:39:41.160 align:start position:0%
Board of Nursing cases one involved the
 
00:39:43.130 --> 00:39:43.140 align:start position:0%
juvenile who was severely abused and
 
00:39:44.630 --> 00:39:44.640 align:start position:0%
they were able to go into non-public to
 
00:39:47.630 --> 00:39:47.640 align:start position:0%
discuss those very sensitive records
 
00:39:49.190 --> 00:39:49.200 align:start position:0%
um while still giving them the
 
00:39:50.990 --> 00:39:51.000 align:start position:0%
respondent due process because that's
 
00:39:52.730 --> 00:39:52.740 align:start position:0%
the key here so I hope that answered
 
00:39:54.650 --> 00:39:54.660 align:start position:0%
your question
 
00:39:56.569 --> 00:39:56.579 align:start position:0%
we'll look at it more on Friday thank
 
00:39:56.579 --> 00:39:58.910 align:start position:0%
we'll look at it more on Friday thank
you

00:39:58.910 --> 00:39:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:00.650 --> 00:40:00.660 align:start position:0%
any other questions yes representative
 
00:40:00.660 --> 00:40:02.089 align:start position:0%
any other questions yes representative
Gerhard

00:40:02.089 --> 00:40:02.099 align:start position:0%
Gerhard
 
00:40:04.190 --> 00:40:04.200 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman
 
00:40:05.690 --> 00:40:05.700 align:start position:0%
as far as
 
00:40:07.550 --> 00:40:07.560 align:start position:0%
there's no fiscal note I'm just curious
 
00:40:09.470 --> 00:40:09.480 align:start position:0%
as to how much do you expect says it
 
00:40:12.589 --> 00:40:12.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:12.599 --> 00:40:13.849 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:40:13.849 --> 00:40:13.859 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:40:16.069 --> 00:40:16.079 align:start position:0%
as far as the workload that you expect
 
00:40:17.930 --> 00:40:17.940 align:start position:0%
to increase do you have any idea if I'm
 
00:40:19.370 --> 00:40:19.380 align:start position:0%
just looking at how much of the fee is
 
00:40:22.730 --> 00:40:22.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:24.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question actually I
 
00:40:26.630 --> 00:40:26.640 align:start position:0%
think the opposite is true I think what
 
00:40:28.130 --> 00:40:28.140 align:start position:0%
we're doing is
 
00:40:28.140 --> 00:40:28.790 align:start position:0%
we're doing is
um

00:40:28.790 --> 00:40:28.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:30.589 --> 00:40:30.599 align:start position:0%
putting ourselves in an opportunity to
 
00:40:33.829 --> 00:40:33.839 align:start position:0%
lower the fees for the licensees both by
 
00:40:35.650 --> 00:40:35.660 align:start position:0%
streamlining processes across the board
 
00:40:39.470 --> 00:40:39.480 align:start position:0%
out lowering costs and then also with
 
00:40:42.050 --> 00:40:42.060 align:start position:0%
the non-lapsing fund the ability to use
 
00:40:45.829 --> 00:40:45.839 align:start position:0%
those funds for things down the road the
 
00:40:49.370 --> 00:40:49.380 align:start position:0%
goal is to lower fees for licensees
 
00:40:51.430 --> 00:40:51.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:40:54.410 --> 00:40:54.420 align:start position:0%
yes representative O'Brien
 
00:40:56.810 --> 00:40:56.820 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman just a quick question
 
00:41:00.470 --> 00:41:00.480 align:start position:0%
um can you answer under 91a there is
 
00:41:02.109 --> 00:41:02.119 align:start position:0%
that like you say cause for
 
00:41:04.730 --> 00:41:04.740 align:start position:0%
confidentiality reasons when the person
 
00:41:06.890 --> 00:41:06.900 align:start position:0%
may be harmed or such in the case of
 
00:41:08.870 --> 00:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
HIPAA and everything else like that
 
00:41:11.630 --> 00:41:11.640 align:start position:0%
could you quote that number so that the
 
00:41:14.569 --> 00:41:14.579 align:start position:0%
committee can research it themselves and
 
00:41:19.910 --> 00:41:19.920 align:start position:0%
see exactly what it says RSA 91a5 A5 yes
 
00:41:21.530 --> 00:41:21.540 align:start position:0%
sir thank you
 
00:41:21.540 --> 00:41:23.870 align:start position:0%
sir thank you
foreign

00:41:23.870 --> 00:41:23.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:26.089 --> 00:41:26.099 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
00:41:28.490 --> 00:41:28.500 align:start position:0%
yes representative true
 
00:41:29.990 --> 00:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:41:31.430 --> 00:41:31.440 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:41:33.410 --> 00:41:33.420 align:start position:0%
um somebody had testified earlier I
 
00:41:34.670 --> 00:41:34.680 align:start position:0%
think it was electrician but I'm not
 
00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:35.450 align:start position:0%
think it was electrician but I'm not
sure

00:41:35.450 --> 00:41:35.460 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:41:36.770 --> 00:41:36.780 align:start position:0%
uh that
 
00:41:38.870 --> 00:41:38.880 align:start position:0%
he was concerned about the board the
 
00:41:40.490 --> 00:41:40.500 align:start position:0%
electrician's board being stripped of
 
00:41:41.750 --> 00:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
its Authority
 
00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:43.550 align:start position:0%
its Authority
and

00:41:43.550 --> 00:41:43.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:41:45.230 --> 00:41:45.240 align:start position:0%
and why would people want to be on the
 
00:41:46.670 --> 00:41:46.680 align:start position:0%
board anymore
 
00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:48.720 align:start position:0%
I thought I heard you say that the
 
00:41:51.410 --> 00:41:51.420 align:start position:0%
boards would not be losing
 
00:41:54.109 --> 00:41:54.119 align:start position:0%
could you address that absolutely thank
 
00:41:55.310 --> 00:41:55.320 align:start position:0%
you for the question I think that's a
 
00:41:57.770 --> 00:41:57.780 align:start position:0%
good point of clarification uh so so
 
00:41:59.270 --> 00:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
some of the authority that would come
 
00:42:02.750 --> 00:42:02.760 align:start position:0%
away from the from the board would be
 
00:42:04.550 --> 00:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
um sort of kick-starting the
 
00:42:06.829 --> 00:42:06.839 align:start position:0%
investigation would be appointing the
 
00:42:09.530 --> 00:42:09.540 align:start position:0%
hearing officer would be appointing
 
00:42:13.370 --> 00:42:13.380 align:start position:0%
counsel to adjudicate the matter they
 
00:42:16.130 --> 00:42:16.140 align:start position:0%
again that's all process related these
 
00:42:17.329 --> 00:42:17.339 align:start position:0%
are things we are currently doing
 
00:42:19.010 --> 00:42:19.020 align:start position:0%
currently we have to wait for board
 
00:42:21.050 --> 00:42:21.060 align:start position:0%
approval to start an investigation which
 
00:42:24.950 --> 00:42:24.960 align:start position:0%
can cause significant delays the boards
 
00:42:27.430 --> 00:42:27.440 align:start position:0%
however would still retain the authority
 
00:42:31.910 --> 00:42:31.920 align:start position:0%
to set the criteria necessary for
 
00:42:33.849 --> 00:42:33.859 align:start position:0%
licensure including
 
00:42:36.650 --> 00:42:36.660 align:start position:0%
education the kind of schooling maybe
 
00:42:39.050 --> 00:42:39.060 align:start position:0%
apprenticeships out in the field sort of
 
00:42:40.849 --> 00:42:40.859 align:start position:0%
work experience those types of things
 
00:42:43.490 --> 00:42:43.500 align:start position:0%
they would retain the ability to decide
 
00:42:46.069 --> 00:42:46.079 align:start position:0%
whether a matter goes to adjudication or
 
00:42:48.410 --> 00:42:48.420 align:start position:0%
not they would sit there and be the
 
00:42:50.390 --> 00:42:50.400 align:start position:0%
final decision makers as to whether
 
00:42:52.490 --> 00:42:52.500 align:start position:0%
discipline occurs or sanctions are
 
00:42:57.530 --> 00:42:57.540 align:start position:0%
applied so so really we're trying to
 
00:42:57.540 --> 00:42:58.790 align:start position:0%
applied so so really we're trying to
again

00:42:58.790 --> 00:42:58.800 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:43:02.329 --> 00:43:02.339 align:start position:0%
give oplc control over the process and
 
00:43:04.370 --> 00:43:04.380 align:start position:0%
the board's control over the substance
 
00:43:05.990 --> 00:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
the criteria
 
00:43:08.390 --> 00:43:08.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:43:12.650 --> 00:43:12.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:15.230 --> 00:43:15.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair so I understand that
 
00:43:17.329 --> 00:43:17.339 align:start position:0%
oplc is trying to go to an online
 
00:43:22.130 --> 00:43:22.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:25.069 --> 00:43:25.079 align:start position:0%
that's a question I understand is that
 
00:43:25.079 --> 00:43:28.190 align:start position:0%
that's a question I understand is that
correct

00:43:28.190 --> 00:43:28.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:30.650 --> 00:43:30.660 align:start position:0%
yes that is correct uh we we currently
 
00:43:32.770 --> 00:43:32.780 align:start position:0%
do have ability
 
00:43:36.349 --> 00:43:36.359 align:start position:0%
to receive applications online one of
 
00:43:38.750 --> 00:43:38.760 align:start position:0%
the major things we are trying to do to
 
00:43:40.550 --> 00:43:40.560 align:start position:0%
streamline the process to keep costs
 
00:43:43.730 --> 00:43:43.740 align:start position:0%
down to improve customer service for all
 
00:43:45.050 --> 00:43:45.060 align:start position:0%
licensees in New Hampshire all
 
00:43:48.230 --> 00:43:48.240 align:start position:0%
applicants is a better system and we
 
00:43:51.950 --> 00:43:51.960 align:start position:0%
actually are implementing very soon a
 
00:43:54.650 --> 00:43:54.660 align:start position:0%
newer better system for licensees so
 
00:43:56.750 --> 00:43:56.760 align:start position:0%
that is correct yes
 
00:43:58.069 --> 00:43:58.079 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
00:44:00.470 --> 00:44:00.480 align:start position:0%
so is it necessary for this type of
 
00:44:02.990 --> 00:44:03.000 align:start position:0%
legislation to be carry forth if we want
 
00:44:05.270 --> 00:44:05.280 align:start position:0%
to use that online process in the manner
 
00:44:11.390 --> 00:44:11.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:15.050 --> 00:44:15.060 align:start position:0%
I believe so I think the majority of the
 
00:44:17.510 --> 00:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
language in the bill is sort of
 
00:44:20.150 --> 00:44:20.160 align:start position:0%
pre-existing language in 310 A1A right
 
00:44:22.609 --> 00:44:22.619 align:start position:0%
now and as uh director Courtney likes to
 
00:44:25.609 --> 00:44:25.619 align:start position:0%
joke we're running out of letters so one
 
00:44:27.829 --> 00:44:27.839 align:start position:0%
of our shifts is to 310 but a lot of the
 
00:44:31.210 --> 00:44:31.220 align:start position:0%
language it's very very similar and then
 
00:44:35.809 --> 00:44:35.819 align:start position:0%
as multiple people have pointed out uh
 
00:44:39.109 --> 00:44:39.119 align:start position:0%
roughly the back 50 pages of this bill
 
00:44:41.870 --> 00:44:41.880 align:start position:0%
is sort of that clean up language in
 
00:44:44.030 --> 00:44:44.040 align:start position:0%
order just to clarify who has fee
 
00:44:46.630 --> 00:44:46.640 align:start position:0%
setting Authority who can appoint
 
00:44:48.890 --> 00:44:48.900 align:start position:0%
investigators who can appoint hearing
 
00:44:50.630 --> 00:44:50.640 align:start position:0%
officers those types of things again
 
00:44:55.730 --> 00:44:55.740 align:start position:0%
clean up for process versus criteria
 
00:44:57.230 --> 00:44:57.240 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
00:45:00.290 --> 00:45:00.300 align:start position:0%
so in determining the administration of
 
00:45:02.450 --> 00:45:02.460 align:start position:0%
these things it's your it's the opl
 
00:45:07.730 --> 00:45:07.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:09.589 --> 00:45:09.599 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry let me rephrase that question
 
00:45:11.750 --> 00:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
you're the one under under the division
 
00:45:16.250 --> 00:45:16.260 align:start position:0%
of enforcement for example how those
 
00:45:16.260 --> 00:45:17.089 align:start position:0%
of enforcement for example how those
um

00:45:17.089 --> 00:45:17.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:18.589 --> 00:45:18.599 align:start position:0%
how the
 
00:45:21.309 --> 00:45:21.319 align:start position:0%
complaints are enforced and how
 
00:45:23.569 --> 00:45:23.579 align:start position:0%
basically everything that's underneath
 
00:45:23.579 --> 00:45:25.250 align:start position:0%
basically everything that's underneath
oplc

00:45:25.250 --> 00:45:25.260 align:start position:0%
oplc
 
00:45:27.829 --> 00:45:27.839 align:start position:0%
is administered whether it's through
 
00:45:30.010 --> 00:45:30.020 align:start position:0%
enforcement or whether it's through
 
00:45:32.930 --> 00:45:32.940 align:start position:0%
legislative legislation appearances it's
 
00:45:35.510 --> 00:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
all done through oplc it is it is your
 
00:45:38.990 --> 00:45:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:40.849 --> 00:45:40.859 align:start position:0%
that's a great question representative
 
00:45:42.650 --> 00:45:42.660 align:start position:0%
So currently for the I can speak for the
 
00:45:42.660 --> 00:45:44.150 align:start position:0%
So currently for the I can speak for the
enforcement

00:45:44.150 --> 00:45:44.160 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
00:45:45.950 --> 00:45:45.960 align:start position:0%
um not every board has the same
 
00:45:48.410 --> 00:45:48.420 align:start position:0%
complaint process so we have
 
00:45:51.170 --> 00:45:51.180 align:start position:0%
approximately 54 different boards and
 
00:45:52.370 --> 00:45:52.380 align:start position:0%
I'll give you an example Real Estate
 
00:45:54.950 --> 00:45:54.960 align:start position:0%
Commission every complaint that comes in
 
00:45:57.589 --> 00:45:57.599 align:start position:0%
shall be investigated regardless of
 
00:45:59.990 --> 00:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
whether it warrants it or not whereas
 
00:46:01.910 --> 00:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
Board of Nursing reviews all complaints
 
00:46:05.270 --> 00:46:05.280 align:start position:0%
first and then those that meet the
 
00:46:08.030 --> 00:46:08.040 align:start position:0%
threshold are then sent to us Board of
 
00:46:10.370 --> 00:46:10.380 align:start position:0%
Medicine receives a complaint the Board
 
00:46:11.750 --> 00:46:11.760 align:start position:0%
of Medicine is very unique in that we
 
00:46:14.390 --> 00:46:14.400 align:start position:0%
receive written complaints we receive
 
00:46:18.109 --> 00:46:18.119 align:start position:0%
lawsuits from Superior Court we receive
 
00:46:20.809 --> 00:46:20.819 align:start position:0%
insurance claims and then we also have
 
00:46:22.670 --> 00:46:22.680 align:start position:0%
hospitals or other medical facilities
 
00:46:25.010 --> 00:46:25.020 align:start position:0%
that report potential wrongdoing so
 
00:46:27.230 --> 00:46:27.240 align:start position:0%
there's four Avenues there
 
00:46:30.230 --> 00:46:30.240 align:start position:0%
what this does is it streamlines the
 
00:46:32.690 --> 00:46:32.700 align:start position:0%
process for just jump starting the
 
00:46:35.150 --> 00:46:35.160 align:start position:0%
complaint for the public right so for
 
00:46:36.950 --> 00:46:36.960 align:start position:0%
the public if they if they feel they've
 
00:46:39.290 --> 00:46:39.300 align:start position:0%
been aggrieved they don't have to worry
 
00:46:40.790 --> 00:46:40.800 align:start position:0%
about saying well geez does this board
 
00:46:42.829 --> 00:46:42.839 align:start position:0%
do this or that it's going to be one
 
00:46:44.690 --> 00:46:44.700 align:start position:0%
process across the board for how we
 
00:46:47.510 --> 00:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
receive the complaint okay which which
 
00:46:51.650 --> 00:46:51.660 align:start position:0%
in turn houses the allegations inside
 
00:46:53.450 --> 00:46:53.460 align:start position:0%
um that would streamline that for us and
 
00:46:55.150 --> 00:46:55.160 align:start position:0%
as attorney osterhout had mentioned
 
00:46:57.589 --> 00:46:57.599 align:start position:0%
there have been unfortunate times where
 
00:47:00.410 --> 00:47:00.420 align:start position:0%
there's been significant delays as a
 
00:47:02.450 --> 00:47:02.460 align:start position:0%
result of the complaint process and I
 
00:47:04.849 --> 00:47:04.859 align:start position:0%
won't give you the specific case
 
00:47:07.069 --> 00:47:07.079 align:start position:0%
some delays come in when we have to
 
00:47:08.589 --> 00:47:08.599 align:start position:0%
potentially pull a board together
 
00:47:12.829 --> 00:47:12.839 align:start position:0%
emergently not for a suspension but in
 
00:47:15.109 --> 00:47:15.119 align:start position:0%
order to begin an act what's called an
 
00:47:17.390 --> 00:47:17.400 align:start position:0%
ex parte investigation we've received
 
00:47:20.390 --> 00:47:20.400 align:start position:0%
information of alleged wrongdoing that
 
00:47:23.510 --> 00:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
that may place an individual in Jeopardy
 
00:47:27.890 --> 00:47:27.900 align:start position:0%
we Loop in law enforcement and we
 
00:47:29.690 --> 00:47:29.700 align:start position:0%
ourselves want to get that investigation
 
00:47:32.329 --> 00:47:32.339 align:start position:0%
underway it can take because people have
 
00:47:34.849 --> 00:47:34.859 align:start position:0%
schedules it can take days to get that
 
00:47:37.190 --> 00:47:37.200 align:start position:0%
when those days those precious hours
 
00:47:39.589 --> 00:47:39.599 align:start position:0%
could be the difference so from an
 
00:47:42.950 --> 00:47:42.960 align:start position:0%
enforcement perspective this this really
 
00:47:45.530 --> 00:47:45.540 align:start position:0%
streamlines the complaint process and
 
00:47:47.690 --> 00:47:47.700 align:start position:0%
how we accept those complaints the
 
00:47:50.809 --> 00:47:50.819 align:start position:0%
boards are the ultimate Arbiter of every
 
00:47:52.790 --> 00:47:52.800 align:start position:0%
complaint they will decide whether they
 
00:47:54.890 --> 00:47:54.900 align:start position:0%
dismiss it whether it goes to adjudice
 
00:47:57.109 --> 00:47:57.119 align:start position:0%
they wish to issue discipline post post
 
00:48:00.589 --> 00:48:00.599 align:start position:0%
adjudication that remember
 
00:48:03.050 --> 00:48:03.060 align:start position:0%
remains all with the boards and then I
 
00:48:05.930 --> 00:48:05.940 align:start position:0%
want to be very clear thank you
 
00:48:07.970 --> 00:48:07.980 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:48:10.510 --> 00:48:10.520 align:start position:0%
representative Aber
 
00:48:13.790 --> 00:48:13.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:48:18.710 --> 00:48:18.720 align:start position:0%
a little Act of listening on my part so
 
00:48:21.050 --> 00:48:21.060 align:start position:0%
as I've been listening to the testimony
 
00:48:24.109 --> 00:48:24.119 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to figure out and I think I
 
00:48:25.849 --> 00:48:25.859 align:start position:0%
finally understand where we're going
 
00:48:28.430 --> 00:48:28.440 align:start position:0%
with this so what you're saying is you
 
00:48:31.910 --> 00:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
have several you have olpc on top and
 
00:48:33.349 --> 00:48:33.359 align:start position:0%
then you've got several boards sitting
 
00:48:35.930 --> 00:48:35.940 align:start position:0%
all underneath
 
00:48:38.750 --> 00:48:38.760 align:start position:0%
a complaint of anything that could come
 
00:48:41.630 --> 00:48:41.640 align:start position:0%
in that could have legal ramifications
 
00:48:43.670 --> 00:48:43.680 align:start position:0%
comes in where an investigation is
 
00:48:45.770 --> 00:48:45.780 align:start position:0%
necessary to launch it and what you're
 
00:48:48.829 --> 00:48:48.839 align:start position:0%
trying to do is streamline it at an olpc
 
00:48:52.370 --> 00:48:52.380 align:start position:0%
level to make sure that it's all treated
 
00:48:55.849 --> 00:48:55.859 align:start position:0%
consistently so if I compare it to a
 
00:48:57.829 --> 00:48:57.839 align:start position:0%
harassment complaint that we would get
 
00:49:01.490 --> 00:49:01.500 align:start position:0%
in my own company we have one in a very
 
00:49:01.500 --> 00:49:03.410 align:start position:0%
in my own company we have one in a very
small

00:49:03.410 --> 00:49:03.420 align:start position:0%
small
 
00:49:06.530 --> 00:49:06.540 align:start position:0%
um small example we have one set of
 
00:49:08.510 --> 00:49:08.520 align:start position:0%
harassment officers they treat those
 
00:49:11.089 --> 00:49:11.099 align:start position:0%
cases of whatever may come in the same
 
00:49:14.329 --> 00:49:14.339 align:start position:0%
exact way every single time and follow
 
00:49:16.190 --> 00:49:16.200 align:start position:0%
the same policy and so what you're
 
00:49:17.510 --> 00:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
saying is
 
00:49:19.970 --> 00:49:19.980 align:start position:0%
having several boards and several
 
00:49:22.750 --> 00:49:22.760 align:start position:0%
different people creates more
 
00:49:25.849 --> 00:49:25.859 align:start position:0%
inconsistencies in opening the state up
 
00:49:28.910 --> 00:49:28.920 align:start position:0%
for lawsuits that were treated One Way
 
00:49:30.589 --> 00:49:30.599 align:start position:0%
versus another way and very
 
00:49:33.050 --> 00:49:33.060 align:start position:0%
inconsistently is that basically what
 
00:49:35.630 --> 00:49:35.640 align:start position:0%
this is thank you I couldn't have said
 
00:49:39.069 --> 00:49:39.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:43.010 --> 00:49:43.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:49.730 --> 00:49:49.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:51.770 --> 00:49:51.780 align:start position:0%
Lynn Stanley
 
00:50:09.710 --> 00:50:09.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:12.349 --> 00:50:12.359 align:start position:0%
there you go there we go thank you
 
00:50:14.510 --> 00:50:14.520 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Lynn Stanley
 
00:50:16.309 --> 00:50:16.319 align:start position:0%
I'm the executive director of the
 
00:50:18.109 --> 00:50:18.119 align:start position:0%
National Association of Social Workers
 
00:50:21.349 --> 00:50:21.359 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire chapter my testimony will
 
00:50:24.530 --> 00:50:24.540 align:start position:0%
be incredibly brief we on the whole are
 
00:50:26.569 --> 00:50:26.579 align:start position:0%
very much in support of this bill we
 
00:50:32.390 --> 00:50:32.400 align:start position:0%
applaud oplc's efforts to streamline uh
 
00:50:36.230 --> 00:50:36.240 align:start position:0%
what it must be a Herculean task uh our
 
00:50:40.430 --> 00:50:40.440 align:start position:0%
only concern that or our primary concern
 
00:50:43.910 --> 00:50:43.920 align:start position:0%
is specifically naming who is on the
 
00:50:43.920 --> 00:50:45.290 align:start position:0%
is specifically naming who is on the
investigation

00:50:45.290 --> 00:50:45.300 align:start position:0%
investigation
 
00:50:49.609 --> 00:50:49.619 align:start position:0%
and so it can be assigned we would like
 
00:50:52.910 --> 00:50:52.920 align:start position:0%
to have uh the content expert be
 
00:50:55.250 --> 00:50:55.260 align:start position:0%
somebody who is who shares the same
 
00:50:56.870 --> 00:50:56.880 align:start position:0%
license as the person who's being
 
00:50:59.510 --> 00:50:59.520 align:start position:0%
investigated uh in the case of social
 
00:51:02.809 --> 00:51:02.819 align:start position:0%
workers this would be other licsws who
 
00:51:04.309 --> 00:51:04.319 align:start position:0%
are also governed by the board of mental
 
00:51:06.170 --> 00:51:06.180 align:start position:0%
health practice we will have a
 
00:51:09.109 --> 00:51:09.119 align:start position:0%
representative at the Friday meeting and
 
00:51:11.030 --> 00:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take any questions if there
 
00:51:12.170 --> 00:51:12.180 align:start position:0%
are any
 
00:51:14.089 --> 00:51:14.099 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
00:51:17.030 --> 00:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
yes representative shewitt thank you Mr
 
00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:17.930 align:start position:0%
yes representative shewitt thank you Mr
chair

00:51:17.930 --> 00:51:17.940 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:51:20.690 --> 00:51:20.700 align:start position:0%
um I assume you have looked at the the
 
00:51:22.329 --> 00:51:22.339 align:start position:0%
bill that
 
00:51:26.510 --> 00:51:26.520 align:start position:0%
deals with your particular profession uh
 
00:51:28.430 --> 00:51:28.440 align:start position:0%
did you see anything in that that would
 
00:51:31.130 --> 00:51:31.140 align:start position:0%
indicate that you would not have input
 
00:51:33.950 --> 00:51:33.960 align:start position:0%
as to an investigator
 
00:51:37.309 --> 00:51:37.319 align:start position:0%
uh there is in the language and I don't
 
00:51:40.130 --> 00:51:40.140 align:start position:0%
have it in front of me that it may be
 
00:51:42.349 --> 00:51:42.359 align:start position:0%
content experts
 
00:51:44.510 --> 00:51:44.520 align:start position:0%
and we would just want the language to
 
00:51:46.549 --> 00:51:46.559 align:start position:0%
indicate that there that there is a
 
00:51:48.410 --> 00:51:48.420 align:start position:0%
Content expert that there is somebody
 
00:51:51.049 --> 00:51:51.059 align:start position:0%
who is who shares the same license as
 
00:51:53.450 --> 00:51:53.460 align:start position:0%
the person who's being investigated
 
00:51:55.670 --> 00:51:55.680 align:start position:0%
but we'd uh if I can continue with that
 
00:51:58.309 --> 00:51:58.319 align:start position:0%
we absolutely see a benefit to having
 
00:52:00.530 --> 00:52:00.540 align:start position:0%
somebody who is experienced with Pros
 
00:52:03.890 --> 00:52:03.900 align:start position:0%
due process law administration also
 
00:52:07.609 --> 00:52:07.619 align:start position:0%
being a part of the that process
 
00:52:11.809 --> 00:52:11.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:13.309 --> 00:52:13.319 align:start position:0%
yes representative can you be available
 
00:52:15.470 --> 00:52:15.480 align:start position:0%
for this subcommittee on Friday we will
 
00:52:18.170 --> 00:52:18.180 align:start position:0%
have a representative there uh on Friday
 
00:52:19.430 --> 00:52:19.440 align:start position:0%
for the subcommittee thank you
 
00:52:19.440 --> 00:52:21.770 align:start position:0%
for the subcommittee thank you
absolutely

00:52:21.770 --> 00:52:21.780 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
00:52:23.150 --> 00:52:23.160 align:start position:0%
no notes
 
00:52:27.670 --> 00:52:27.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:32.030 --> 00:52:32.040 align:start position:0%
Celia Oliver PhD
 
00:52:41.770 --> 00:52:41.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:45.950 --> 00:52:45.960 align:start position:0%
good morning I'm Dr Celia Oliver
 
00:52:48.530 --> 00:52:48.540 align:start position:0%
and I'm very happy to be here today and
 
00:52:51.710 --> 00:52:51.720 align:start position:0%
to speak with you I am representing the
 
00:52:53.990 --> 00:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Psychological Association
 
00:52:57.770 --> 00:52:57.780 align:start position:0%
and that is a state chapter of the
 
00:53:00.950 --> 00:53:00.960 align:start position:0%
American Psychological Association
 
00:53:04.190 --> 00:53:04.200 align:start position:0%
and just a non-profit member
 
00:53:06.650 --> 00:53:06.660 align:start position:0%
professional supported
 
00:53:06.660 --> 00:53:08.210 align:start position:0%
professional supported
um organization

00:53:08.210 --> 00:53:08.220 align:start position:0%
um organization
 
00:53:08.220 --> 00:53:09.650 align:start position:0%
um organization
so

00:53:09.650 --> 00:53:09.660 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:53:11.510 --> 00:53:11.520 align:start position:0%
um I'm here at state to provide both
 
00:53:15.109 --> 00:53:15.119 align:start position:0%
verbal and written testimony on behalf
 
00:53:16.849 --> 00:53:16.859 align:start position:0%
of nhpa
 
00:53:20.089 --> 00:53:20.099 align:start position:0%
and we are essentially supporting this
 
00:53:22.970 --> 00:53:22.980 align:start position:0%
legislation and along with our
 
00:53:24.950 --> 00:53:24.960 align:start position:0%
colleagues at the board of psychologists
 
00:53:27.650 --> 00:53:27.660 align:start position:0%
licensing board and
 
00:53:29.450 --> 00:53:29.460 align:start position:0%
um to a somewhat lesser extent the
 
00:53:31.309 --> 00:53:31.319 align:start position:0%
social workers although we have a lot in
 
00:53:33.829 --> 00:53:33.839 align:start position:0%
common with them we have a number of
 
00:53:36.710 --> 00:53:36.720 align:start position:0%
concerns and so
 
00:53:39.349 --> 00:53:39.359 align:start position:0%
um we just want to make sure that while
 
00:53:42.530 --> 00:53:42.540 align:start position:0%
we're supporting this the intent of
 
00:53:44.270 --> 00:53:44.280 align:start position:0%
everything being streamlined and more
 
00:53:46.609 --> 00:53:46.619 align:start position:0%
consistent that we don't lose some of
 
00:53:48.890 --> 00:53:48.900 align:start position:0%
the things that are working for us I
 
00:53:50.690 --> 00:53:50.700 align:start position:0%
know that others have already addressed
 
00:53:53.150 --> 00:53:53.160 align:start position:0%
the confidentiality I just want to bring
 
00:53:56.089 --> 00:53:56.099 align:start position:0%
it up again it's an incredibly important
 
00:53:58.190 --> 00:53:58.200 align:start position:0%
aspect of the work that we do and it's
 
00:53:59.930 --> 00:53:59.940 align:start position:0%
important for the citizens and our
 
00:54:02.870 --> 00:54:02.880 align:start position:0%
patients to have this confidentiality
 
00:54:05.450 --> 00:54:05.460 align:start position:0%
and especially in circumstances where an
 
00:54:08.390 --> 00:54:08.400 align:start position:0%
allegation might be filed by essentially
 
00:54:10.730 --> 00:54:10.740 align:start position:0%
a third party like family member it
 
00:54:12.829 --> 00:54:12.839 align:start position:0%
could even be an ex-spouse
 
00:54:16.430 --> 00:54:16.440 align:start position:0%
or where disclosure feels necessary to
 
00:54:19.549 --> 00:54:19.559 align:start position:0%
another agency like law enforcement so
 
00:54:21.170 --> 00:54:21.180 align:start position:0%
in those areas you really open
 
00:54:24.170 --> 00:54:24.180 align:start position:0%
yourselves up for information sensitive
 
00:54:26.569 --> 00:54:26.579 align:start position:0%
information getting out from the medical
 
00:54:26.579 --> 00:54:27.650 align:start position:0%
information getting out from the medical
record

00:54:27.650 --> 00:54:27.660 align:start position:0%
record
 
00:54:27.660 --> 00:54:29.030 align:start position:0%
record
so

00:54:29.030 --> 00:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:54:32.329 --> 00:54:32.339 align:start position:0%
um we are concerned about that we're
 
00:54:34.790 --> 00:54:34.800 align:start position:0%
also really concerned about this
 
00:54:37.609 --> 00:54:37.619 align:start position:0%
differentiation of allegation versus
 
00:54:40.630 --> 00:54:40.640 align:start position:0%
complaint because for us
 
00:54:43.849 --> 00:54:43.859 align:start position:0%
along with an excuse me
 
00:54:46.750 --> 00:54:46.760 align:start position:0%
along with a number of other
 
00:54:49.910 --> 00:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Providers we are frequent
 
00:54:52.250 --> 00:54:52.260 align:start position:0%
we're constantly being recrudentialed
 
00:54:55.849 --> 00:54:55.859 align:start position:0%
and we're asked in these recondentialing
 
00:55:00.109 --> 00:55:00.119 align:start position:0%
um applications is there any pending
 
00:55:00.119 --> 00:55:01.609 align:start position:0%
um applications is there any pending
complaint

00:55:01.609 --> 00:55:01.619 align:start position:0%
complaint
 
00:55:03.710 --> 00:55:03.720 align:start position:0%
well if something is navigation then
 
00:55:06.470 --> 00:55:06.480 align:start position:0%
we're under no obligation to report it
 
00:55:08.510 --> 00:55:08.520 align:start position:0%
and that all that allegation could be
 
00:55:10.490 --> 00:55:10.500 align:start position:0%
something very trivial so of course
 
00:55:12.589 --> 00:55:12.599 align:start position:0%
we're not going to report that but if it
 
00:55:15.230 --> 00:55:15.240 align:start position:0%
has moved into a complaint then we are
 
00:55:17.930 --> 00:55:17.940 align:start position:0%
required to report that and most likely
 
00:55:20.270 --> 00:55:20.280 align:start position:0%
our credentialing will either be denied
 
00:55:23.450 --> 00:55:23.460 align:start position:0%
or severely restricted so that
 
00:55:26.329 --> 00:55:26.339 align:start position:0%
distinction is very important to us also
 
00:55:27.650 --> 00:55:27.660 align:start position:0%
as the board of psychologists has
 
00:55:30.170 --> 00:55:30.180 align:start position:0%
pointed out knowing that an allegation
 
00:55:32.210 --> 00:55:32.220 align:start position:0%
has been made because we are treating
 
00:55:34.430 --> 00:55:34.440 align:start position:0%
very sensitive potentially volatile
 
00:55:37.790 --> 00:55:37.800 align:start position:0%
cases and we need to know that something
 
00:55:39.470 --> 00:55:39.480 align:start position:0%
is not going right with this this
 
00:55:40.910 --> 00:55:40.920 align:start position:0%
patient that we might not have been
 
00:55:43.069 --> 00:55:43.079 align:start position:0%
aware of before although you know
 
00:55:45.170 --> 00:55:45.180 align:start position:0%
hopefully we were but sometimes that
 
00:55:47.210 --> 00:55:47.220 align:start position:0%
happens so we need to know what's going
 
00:55:49.430 --> 00:55:49.440 align:start position:0%
on we need that done as quickly and
 
00:55:51.530 --> 00:55:51.540 align:start position:0%
timely as possible
 
00:55:54.589 --> 00:55:54.599 align:start position:0%
and then in terms of an investigation of
 
00:55:57.950 --> 00:55:57.960 align:start position:0%
potential misconduct again like our
 
00:55:59.870 --> 00:55:59.880 align:start position:0%
colleagues the social workers and along
 
00:56:01.970 --> 00:56:01.980 align:start position:0%
with the board of psychologists were
 
00:56:03.470 --> 00:56:03.480 align:start position:0%
very concerned about who's being
 
00:56:06.770 --> 00:56:06.780 align:start position:0%
assigned to those investigations
 
00:56:09.589 --> 00:56:09.599 align:start position:0%
our profession like many others is very
 
00:56:13.130 --> 00:56:13.140 align:start position:0%
complex and has many subcategories I've
 
00:56:15.470 --> 00:56:15.480 align:start position:0%
been a licensed psychologist in New
 
00:56:19.549 --> 00:56:19.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for 25 years and so I was
 
00:56:21.290 --> 00:56:21.300 align:start position:0%
licensed originally with Board of mental
 
00:56:22.790 --> 00:56:22.800 align:start position:0%
health practice and then under the board
 
00:56:25.130 --> 00:56:25.140 align:start position:0%
of psychologists I've been very active
 
00:56:27.650 --> 00:56:27.660 align:start position:0%
in the profession for all those years
 
00:56:27.660 --> 00:56:29.450 align:start position:0%
in the profession for all those years
and

00:56:29.450 --> 00:56:29.460 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:56:32.030 --> 00:56:32.040 align:start position:0%
in terms of Investigations because we
 
00:56:35.569 --> 00:56:35.579 align:start position:0%
have such complex areas of specialty
 
00:56:38.690 --> 00:56:38.700 align:start position:0%
I would not for instance be at all
 
00:56:41.030 --> 00:56:41.040 align:start position:0%
qualified to investigate one of my
 
00:56:43.670 --> 00:56:43.680 align:start position:0%
colleagues who's a neuropsychologist I'm
 
00:56:46.309 --> 00:56:46.319 align:start position:0%
a clinical psychologist I would not be
 
00:56:48.109 --> 00:56:48.119 align:start position:0%
able to understand the nuances that
 
00:56:50.390 --> 00:56:50.400 align:start position:0%
they're professional enough to make an
 
00:56:53.030 --> 00:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
ethical investigation so I'm very
 
00:56:56.630 --> 00:56:56.640 align:start position:0%
concerned not only that the investigator
 
00:56:59.690 --> 00:56:59.700 align:start position:0%
is licensed as a psychologist but also
 
00:57:02.329 --> 00:57:02.339 align:start position:0%
that there is some sort of pool of
 
00:57:04.370 --> 00:57:04.380 align:start position:0%
investigators that can be pulled from
 
00:57:07.190 --> 00:57:07.200 align:start position:0%
that matches up and you're a
 
00:57:09.109 --> 00:57:09.119 align:start position:0%
psychologist with a neuropsychological
 
00:57:09.119 --> 00:57:11.510 align:start position:0%
psychologist with a neuropsychological
investigation

00:57:11.510 --> 00:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
investigation
 
00:57:14.510 --> 00:57:14.520 align:start position:0%
and that this pull-up investigators
 
00:57:17.270 --> 00:57:17.280 align:start position:0%
because if you only have one expert then
 
00:57:20.390 --> 00:57:20.400 align:start position:0%
you can imagine how there's opening for
 
00:57:22.490 --> 00:57:22.500 align:start position:0%
personal bias that maybe that
 
00:57:25.010 --> 00:57:25.020 align:start position:0%
investigator isn't even aware of but if
 
00:57:27.049 --> 00:57:27.059 align:start position:0%
you're working together then your
 
00:57:29.329 --> 00:57:29.339 align:start position:0%
colleagues can hold to each other's
 
00:57:32.690 --> 00:57:32.700 align:start position:0%
accountable and I always believe more
 
00:57:35.870 --> 00:57:35.880 align:start position:0%
brains are better than one so
 
00:57:38.569 --> 00:57:38.579 align:start position:0%
these are some of our concerns we will
 
00:57:41.510 --> 00:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
have a representative at the
 
00:57:45.109 --> 00:57:45.119 align:start position:0%
um working committee on Friday and that
 
00:57:50.390 --> 00:57:50.400 align:start position:0%
is John dojoy and so I am open to any
 
00:57:52.549 --> 00:57:52.559 align:start position:0%
questions or anything I can provide and
 
00:57:54.230 --> 00:57:54.240 align:start position:0%
I appreciate you hearing my testimony
 
00:57:56.089 --> 00:57:56.099 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for your testimony
 
00:57:58.549 --> 00:57:58.559 align:start position:0%
any questions yes representative a bear
 
00:58:00.349 --> 00:58:00.359 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:58:04.730 --> 00:58:04.740 align:start position:0%
so what you're asking for is more of an
 
00:58:07.309 --> 00:58:07.319 align:start position:0%
accountability from olpc during the
 
00:58:10.370 --> 00:58:10.380 align:start position:0%
investigation back to you
 
00:58:15.470 --> 00:58:15.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:19.790 --> 00:58:19.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:22.609 --> 00:58:22.619 align:start position:0%
I think what you mean is accountability
 
00:58:25.430 --> 00:58:25.440 align:start position:0%
back to the board not back to the
 
00:58:27.770 --> 00:58:27.780 align:start position:0%
licensee is that correct
 
00:58:30.170 --> 00:58:30.180 align:start position:0%
it depends on the situation that we're
 
00:58:32.750 --> 00:58:32.760 align:start position:0%
talking about because a specific
 
00:58:34.609 --> 00:58:34.619 align:start position:0%
allegation would be about a specific
 
00:58:34.619 --> 00:58:36.049 align:start position:0%
allegation would be about a specific
licensee

00:58:36.049 --> 00:58:36.059 align:start position:0%
licensee
 
00:58:38.150 --> 00:58:38.160 align:start position:0%
so we would want the license C to be
 
00:58:41.089 --> 00:58:41.099 align:start position:0%
informed and fully kept prized there
 
00:58:42.710 --> 00:58:42.720 align:start position:0%
would also be circumstances where we
 
00:58:45.589 --> 00:58:45.599 align:start position:0%
would want Ford who is making the
 
00:58:45.599 --> 00:58:47.049 align:start position:0%
would want Ford who is making the
disciplinary

00:58:47.049 --> 00:58:47.059 align:start position:0%
disciplinary
 
00:58:47.059 --> 00:58:48.890 align:start position:0%
disciplinary
determinations

00:58:48.890 --> 00:58:48.900 align:start position:0%
determinations
 
00:58:50.390 --> 00:58:50.400 align:start position:0%
and I think
 
00:58:53.270 --> 00:58:53.280 align:start position:0%
possibly other decisions prior to that
 
00:58:55.549 --> 00:58:55.559 align:start position:0%
where the board of psychologists would
 
00:58:57.589 --> 00:58:57.599 align:start position:0%
be the ones to be notified
 
00:59:02.870 --> 00:59:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:09.109 --> 00:59:09.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:12.349 --> 00:59:12.359 align:start position:0%
shouldn't wouldn't it be wise for that
 
00:59:16.970 --> 00:59:16.980 align:start position:0%
to go from in just a hierarchy of
 
00:59:20.750 --> 00:59:20.760 align:start position:0%
in the hierarchy pyramid to go from olpc
 
00:59:23.569 --> 00:59:23.579 align:start position:0%
to the board an appointed board member
 
00:59:24.890 --> 00:59:24.900 align:start position:0%
and I would like to hear from the
 
00:59:26.870 --> 00:59:26.880 align:start position:0%
electrical Association again on that
 
00:59:30.230 --> 00:59:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:33.289 --> 00:59:33.299 align:start position:0%
I am not certain what I'm concerned
 
00:59:35.510 --> 00:59:35.520 align:start position:0%
about in that potential scenario that
 
00:59:38.750 --> 00:59:38.760 align:start position:0%
I'm imagining as a practitioner is that
 
00:59:40.789 --> 00:59:40.799 align:start position:0%
there would be such a delay if it was
 
00:59:44.150 --> 00:59:44.160 align:start position:0%
going from the oplc to the board and
 
00:59:46.609 --> 00:59:46.619 align:start position:0%
then to me as the practitioner
 
00:59:48.589 --> 00:59:48.599 align:start position:0%
where it might be something I need to
 
00:59:52.309 --> 00:59:52.319 align:start position:0%
know directly and as close to immediate
 
00:59:54.349 --> 00:59:54.359 align:start position:0%
as possible
 
00:59:57.349 --> 00:59:57.359 align:start position:0%
so those are our concerns and again this
 
00:59:59.030 --> 00:59:59.040 align:start position:0%
is about how these things get
 
00:59:59.040 --> 01:00:01.329 align:start position:0%
is about how these things get
implemented

01:00:01.329 --> 01:00:01.339 align:start position:0%
implemented
 
01:00:03.829 --> 01:00:03.839 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:00:07.250 --> 01:00:07.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:08.690 --> 01:00:08.700 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much for your
 
01:00:10.670 --> 01:00:10.680 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you
 
01:00:12.289 --> 01:00:12.299 align:start position:0%

members
 
01:00:28.910 --> 01:00:28.920 align:start position:0%
um I want to speak uh about this bill in
 
01:00:30.470 --> 01:00:30.480 align:start position:0%
a couple of ways one is is that there
 
01:00:32.089 --> 01:00:32.099 align:start position:0%
are parts of it that I support I believe
 
01:00:33.589 --> 01:00:33.599 align:start position:0%
that there are many ways that we could
 
01:00:35.630 --> 01:00:35.640 align:start position:0%
increase I'm sorry Mr chair can you
 
01:00:37.670 --> 01:00:37.680 align:start position:0%
please can you also please restate your
 
01:00:40.010 --> 01:00:40.020 align:start position:0%
name because sure my name is Dr Michael
 
01:00:42.410 --> 01:00:42.420 align:start position:0%

01:00:47.930 --> 01:00:47.940 align:start position:0%
Bedford
 
01:00:49.910 --> 01:00:49.920 align:start position:0%
um I was present during the hearings
 
01:00:52.430 --> 01:00:52.440 align:start position:0%
about 10 to 12 years ago where we
 
01:00:54.770 --> 01:00:54.780 align:start position:0%
revised the protocols for the board of
 
01:00:56.329 --> 01:00:56.339 align:start position:0%
mental health practice to address some
 
01:00:59.270 --> 01:00:59.280 align:start position:0%
of these issues and despite what the
 
01:01:01.190 --> 01:01:01.200 align:start position:0%
council for the oplc had said about
 
01:01:05.470 --> 01:01:05.480 align:start position:0%
these things never happening where uh uh
 
01:01:07.609 --> 01:01:07.619 align:start position:0%
licensees would not be aware of the
 
01:01:09.650 --> 01:01:09.660 align:start position:0%
strength of the case against them that
 
01:01:13.670 --> 01:01:13.680 align:start position:0%
was routine practice before we reformed
 
01:01:15.349 --> 01:01:15.359 align:start position:0%
the rules going through gel car three
 
01:01:16.670 --> 01:01:16.680 align:start position:0%
times against the board of mental health
 
01:01:19.609 --> 01:01:19.619 align:start position:0%
practice back then in addition licensees
 
01:01:20.809 --> 01:01:20.819 align:start position:0%
were not informed that they had
 
01:01:23.270 --> 01:01:23.280 align:start position:0%
complaints against them at that time and
 
01:01:25.010 --> 01:01:25.020 align:start position:0%
we had situations where there were
 
01:01:28.849 --> 01:01:28.859 align:start position:0%
people who were unstable and they would
 
01:01:30.470 --> 01:01:30.480 align:start position:0%
generate a complaint and that could
 
01:01:32.569 --> 01:01:32.579 align:start position:0%
create risk both for them and for the
 
01:01:34.309 --> 01:01:34.319 align:start position:0%
psychologists to continue to treat them
 
01:01:36.170 --> 01:01:36.180 align:start position:0%
while we were waiting to be informed
 
01:01:38.089 --> 01:01:38.099 align:start position:0%
that there was in fact a complaint filed
 
01:01:39.710 --> 01:01:39.720 align:start position:0%
these are the things that we were
 
01:01:41.510 --> 01:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
concerned about back then and that's why
 
01:01:43.430 --> 01:01:43.440 align:start position:0%
we argued for those rules and they got
 
01:01:46.069 --> 01:01:46.079 align:start position:0%
those rules in place and we're now
 
01:01:47.750 --> 01:01:47.760 align:start position:0%
looking at having all of that revoked
 
01:01:49.970 --> 01:01:49.980 align:start position:0%
again and recreating those dangerous
 
01:01:52.430 --> 01:01:52.440 align:start position:0%
situations in practice and that's really
 
01:01:53.829 --> 01:01:53.839 align:start position:0%
important to us
 
01:01:57.349 --> 01:01:57.359 align:start position:0%
I have a number of objections to this uh
 
01:01:59.690 --> 01:01:59.700 align:start position:0%
Bill I'm going to limit my speech today
 
01:02:00.829 --> 01:02:00.839 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to submit written
 
01:02:03.770 --> 01:02:03.780 align:start position:0%
testimony to be considered on Friday but
 
01:02:05.150 --> 01:02:05.160 align:start position:0%
I want to just kind of talk about it
 
01:02:07.130 --> 01:02:07.140 align:start position:0%
more globally because I think that we
 
01:02:10.130 --> 01:02:10.140 align:start position:0%
have a balancing act here on one hand we
 
01:02:12.410 --> 01:02:12.420 align:start position:0%
have administrative Simplicity or
 
01:02:14.329 --> 01:02:14.339 align:start position:0%
efficiency and on the other hand we have
 
01:02:17.329 --> 01:02:17.339 align:start position:0%
accuracy and Justice and we can't lean
 
01:02:19.370 --> 01:02:19.380 align:start position:0%
in either direction on this we have to
 
01:02:21.349 --> 01:02:21.359 align:start position:0%
balance both I mean if you want to get
 
01:02:23.690 --> 01:02:23.700 align:start position:0%
administrative Simplicity we could flip
 
01:02:25.250 --> 01:02:25.260 align:start position:0%
a coin every time a complaint comes in
 
01:02:26.690 --> 01:02:26.700 align:start position:0%
it would be really fast we'd have a
 
01:02:28.849 --> 01:02:28.859 align:start position:0%
decision immediately we would have very
 
01:02:30.530 --> 01:02:30.540 align:start position:0%
little Justice and accuracy right
 
01:02:33.049 --> 01:02:33.059 align:start position:0%
nobody's proposing that we do that but I
 
01:02:35.270 --> 01:02:35.280 align:start position:0%
believe that this bill leans heavily in
 
01:02:36.349 --> 01:02:36.359 align:start position:0%
the direction of administrative
 
01:02:36.359 --> 01:02:37.690 align:start position:0%
the direction of administrative
Simplicity

01:02:37.690 --> 01:02:37.700 align:start position:0%
Simplicity
 
01:02:41.270 --> 01:02:41.280 align:start position:0%
and it costs us in terms of justice and
 
01:02:43.190 --> 01:02:43.200 align:start position:0%
and accuracy
 
01:02:46.670 --> 01:02:46.680 align:start position:0%
um I think that right now we're trying
 
01:02:49.490 --> 01:02:49.500 align:start position:0%
to simplify a process for 53 very
 
01:02:51.650 --> 01:02:51.660 align:start position:0%
different boards or 54 very different
 
01:02:55.069 --> 01:02:55.079 align:start position:0%
boards into one routine process it's one
 
01:02:57.530 --> 01:02:57.540 align:start position:0%
size fits all and as a really big guy
 
01:02:59.750 --> 01:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
I've had familiarity with one size fits
 
01:03:02.690 --> 01:03:02.700 align:start position:0%
all and typically it's one size fits no
 
01:03:04.849 --> 01:03:04.859 align:start position:0%
one and I think that's what I'm trying
 
01:03:07.789 --> 01:03:07.799 align:start position:0%
to avoid and this kind of a circumstance
 
01:03:10.970 --> 01:03:10.980 align:start position:0%
um you know the the intent as stated is
 
01:03:12.530 --> 01:03:12.540 align:start position:0%
laudable that the boards are going to
 
01:03:14.690 --> 01:03:14.700 align:start position:0%
retain authority over profession related
 
01:03:18.230 --> 01:03:18.240 align:start position:0%
information and I and that uh you know
 
01:03:21.230 --> 01:03:21.240 align:start position:0%
that the just the nuts and bolts of you
 
01:03:23.329 --> 01:03:23.339 align:start position:0%
know administering licensing and things
 
01:03:25.190 --> 01:03:25.200 align:start position:0%
like that is going to be with the oplc
 
01:03:27.410 --> 01:03:27.420 align:start position:0%
but that's not what the bill says the
 
01:03:29.630 --> 01:03:29.640 align:start position:0%
bill doesn't say that at all
 
01:03:33.589 --> 01:03:33.599 align:start position:0%
um basically uh you know what they do is
 
01:03:35.630 --> 01:03:35.640 align:start position:0%
they tend to take away all of our
 
01:03:38.450 --> 01:03:38.460 align:start position:0%
rulemaking Authority they take away our
 
01:03:41.089 --> 01:03:41.099 align:start position:0%
ability to run the hearings and write
 
01:03:43.670 --> 01:03:43.680 align:start position:0%
rules that would regulate the hearings
 
01:03:45.710 --> 01:03:45.720 align:start position:0%
um and so I think that these are
 
01:03:49.490 --> 01:03:49.500 align:start position:0%
significant pieces uh that we would need
 
01:03:52.190 --> 01:03:52.200 align:start position:0%
to be able to have an effective and fair
 
01:03:54.109 --> 01:03:54.119 align:start position:0%
set of solutions when we're adjudicating
 
01:03:56.990 --> 01:03:57.000 align:start position:0%
hearings they Define us as triers of
 
01:03:59.930 --> 01:03:59.940 align:start position:0%
fact but the investigation is conducted
 
01:04:02.170 --> 01:04:02.180 align:start position:0%
by the oplc not necessarily with
 
01:04:04.789 --> 01:04:04.799 align:start position:0%
professionals that are informed about
 
01:04:04.799 --> 01:04:06.470 align:start position:0%
professionals that are informed about
the

01:04:06.470 --> 01:04:06.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:04:08.329 --> 01:04:08.339 align:start position:0%
um the ethics of our profession which
 
01:04:10.190 --> 01:04:10.200 align:start position:0%
are very complex or even the
 
01:04:12.829 --> 01:04:12.839 align:start position:0%
professional specifics uh the presiding
 
01:04:15.530 --> 01:04:15.540 align:start position:0%
officers are appointed by the oplc the
 
01:04:17.510 --> 01:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
procedures in the hearing are written by
 
01:04:21.049 --> 01:04:21.059 align:start position:0%
the oplc again in a one-size-fits-all uh
 
01:04:25.069 --> 01:04:25.079 align:start position:0%
kind of a fashion and um and that's not
 
01:04:27.710 --> 01:04:27.720 align:start position:0%
going to work it didn't work in the past
 
01:04:29.450 --> 01:04:29.460 align:start position:0%
which is what led to the effort to
 
01:04:31.789 --> 01:04:31.799 align:start position:0%
reform all of these rules 10 to 12 years
 
01:04:34.250 --> 01:04:34.260 align:start position:0%
ago and now we're aiming back in that
 
01:04:36.230 --> 01:04:36.240 align:start position:0%
direction again and I think it could it
 
01:04:38.870 --> 01:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
it's going to be a big problem
 
01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:39.710 align:start position:0%
it's going to be a big problem
um

01:04:39.710 --> 01:04:39.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:42.109 --> 01:04:42.119 align:start position:0%
I think uh at least with psychologists
 
01:04:44.809 --> 01:04:44.819 align:start position:0%
in addition there are some unwarranted
 
01:04:46.609 --> 01:04:46.619 align:start position:0%
increases in penalties that are going to
 
01:04:49.190 --> 01:04:49.200 align:start position:0%
create a potential burden on licensees
 
01:04:51.890 --> 01:04:51.900 align:start position:0%
the potential fines have been increased
 
01:04:55.069 --> 01:04:55.079 align:start position:0%
by 50 percent from 2 000 uh to three
 
01:04:57.530 --> 01:04:57.540 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars for an individual uh
 
01:05:00.049 --> 01:05:00.059 align:start position:0%
fine and 200 per day to three hundred
 
01:05:01.670 --> 01:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
dollars per day but that's really the
 
01:05:04.789 --> 01:05:04.799 align:start position:0%
smallest piece of it uh section 310
 
01:05:08.569 --> 01:05:08.579 align:start position:0%
colon 12 Roman 5 grants the ability to
 
01:05:10.789 --> 01:05:10.799 align:start position:0%
charge the licensee for the cost of the
 
01:05:12.829 --> 01:05:12.839 align:start position:0%
investigation and the prosecution of the
 
01:05:15.770 --> 01:05:15.780 align:start position:0%
complaint against them this I believe is
 
01:05:18.710 --> 01:05:18.720 align:start position:0%
an egregious uh violation of due process
 
01:05:21.230 --> 01:05:21.240 align:start position:0%
it builds Upon A previously passed
 
01:05:22.630 --> 01:05:22.640 align:start position:0%
statute that
 
01:05:22.640 --> 01:05:24.609 align:start position:0%
statute that
RSA

01:05:24.609 --> 01:05:24.619 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
01:05:28.370 --> 01:05:28.380 align:start position:0%
332-g colon 11 which somehow passed in
 
01:05:31.130 --> 01:05:31.140 align:start position:0%
2016 without commentary from a single
 
01:05:31.140 --> 01:05:32.329 align:start position:0%
2016 without commentary from a single
board

01:05:32.329 --> 01:05:32.339 align:start position:0%
board
 
01:05:36.410 --> 01:05:36.420 align:start position:0%
um and uh at least that statute had a
 
01:05:38.390 --> 01:05:38.400 align:start position:0%
ten thousand dollar limitation
 
01:05:40.370 --> 01:05:40.380 align:start position:0%
as it's proposed within this current
 
01:05:43.069 --> 01:05:43.079 align:start position:0%
bill there is no limitation so if
 
01:05:44.210 --> 01:05:44.220 align:start position:0%
there's a hundred thousand dollar
 
01:05:46.309 --> 01:05:46.319 align:start position:0%
investigation or a five hundred thousand
 
01:05:48.349 --> 01:05:48.359 align:start position:0%
dollar investigation
 
01:05:50.089 --> 01:05:50.099 align:start position:0%
um the uh
 
01:05:51.589 --> 01:05:51.599 align:start position:0%
you know they have the ability to
 
01:05:54.049 --> 01:05:54.059 align:start position:0%
enforce that the collection of that onto
 
01:05:55.970 --> 01:05:55.980 align:start position:0%
a licensee
 
01:05:58.130 --> 01:05:58.140 align:start position:0%
that to me seems
 
01:06:00.170 --> 01:06:00.180 align:start position:0%
um completely unfair
 
01:06:03.230 --> 01:06:03.240 align:start position:0%
um in addition uh the standard of proof
 
01:06:05.030 --> 01:06:05.040 align:start position:0%
and licensure complaints is very low
 
01:06:07.130 --> 01:06:07.140 align:start position:0%
from somewhere depending upon the issue
 
01:06:09.770 --> 01:06:09.780 align:start position:0%
preponderance of the evidence to uh
 
01:06:11.210 --> 01:06:11.220 align:start position:0%
clear and convincing evidence that's
 
01:06:15.650 --> 01:06:15.660 align:start position:0%
between 51 to 75 percent certainty
 
01:06:17.870 --> 01:06:17.880 align:start position:0%
um uh the standard of proof in criminal
 
01:06:19.789 --> 01:06:19.799 align:start position:0%
cases is beyond a reasonable doubt which
 
01:06:21.710 --> 01:06:21.720 align:start position:0%
is typically thought of as about 95
 
01:06:25.130 --> 01:06:25.140 align:start position:0%
certainty right but in criminal cases
 
01:06:27.589 --> 01:06:27.599 align:start position:0%
they don't charge for the cost of the
 
01:06:30.349 --> 01:06:30.359 align:start position:0%
investigation to the criminal who's
 
01:06:32.569 --> 01:06:32.579 align:start position:0%
being charged you know and so we're
 
01:06:35.089 --> 01:06:35.099 align:start position:0%
looking at this huge potential penalty
 
01:06:38.270 --> 01:06:38.280 align:start position:0%
to be enforced upon licensees
 
01:06:40.730 --> 01:06:40.740 align:start position:0%
um and I gotta ask why and I think one
 
01:06:43.250 --> 01:06:43.260 align:start position:0%
of the things is that it goes back to
 
01:06:45.289 --> 01:06:45.299 align:start position:0%
what we talked about initially
 
01:06:47.569 --> 01:06:47.579 align:start position:0%
um the way the boards used to do
 
01:06:49.730 --> 01:06:49.740 align:start position:0%
business is they would sit you down and
 
01:06:52.789 --> 01:06:52.799 align:start position:0%
say you know this is what we're offering
 
01:06:54.230 --> 01:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
you we're not going to tell you the
 
01:06:56.150 --> 01:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
strength of our case against you but it
 
01:06:58.789 --> 01:06:58.799 align:start position:0%
could be a lot worse if you don't agree
 
01:07:01.910 --> 01:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
to a settlement and they would use that
 
01:07:03.829 --> 01:07:03.839 align:start position:0%
leverage to achieve settlements and this
 
01:07:06.289 --> 01:07:06.299 align:start position:0%
is pre-2010 right so it's a long time
 
01:07:09.049 --> 01:07:09.059 align:start position:0%
ago since then things have gotten a lot
 
01:07:10.849 --> 01:07:10.859 align:start position:0%
better back at that time we were
 
01:07:12.529 --> 01:07:12.539 align:start position:0%
identified as the most dangerous state
 
01:07:14.510 --> 01:07:14.520 align:start position:0%
in the country to practice and we
 
01:07:15.950 --> 01:07:15.960 align:start position:0%
couldn't get psychologists to come to
 
01:07:19.010 --> 01:07:19.020 align:start position:0%
this state okay since then that's not
 
01:07:20.450 --> 01:07:20.460 align:start position:0%
the case psychologists are coming here
 
01:07:22.730 --> 01:07:22.740 align:start position:0%
regularly our population of licensed
 
01:07:25.430 --> 01:07:25.440 align:start position:0%
psychologists has grown I think that's a
 
01:07:28.190 --> 01:07:28.200 align:start position:0%
good thing I don't think the solution is
 
01:07:29.990 --> 01:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
just open the doors to make license or
 
01:07:31.309 --> 01:07:31.319 align:start position:0%
easy I think we want to bring in
 
01:07:33.529 --> 01:07:33.539 align:start position:0%
competent qualified people we want to
 
01:07:35.809 --> 01:07:35.819 align:start position:0%
hold them to good standard practice we
 
01:07:37.490 --> 01:07:37.500 align:start position:0%
want to be able to enforce penalties as
 
01:07:39.230 --> 01:07:39.240 align:start position:0%
we need to if they violate those
 
01:07:42.650 --> 01:07:42.660 align:start position:0%
standards but we don't want to make it
 
01:07:44.390 --> 01:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
so onerous that nobody wants to come and
 
01:07:46.789 --> 01:07:46.799 align:start position:0%
work here that would be a bad outcome
 
01:07:49.730 --> 01:07:49.740 align:start position:0%
and I think that's where that's headed
 
01:07:51.770 --> 01:07:51.780 align:start position:0%
um I think we can do much better than
 
01:07:53.690 --> 01:07:53.700 align:start position:0%
this we need to do much better than this
 
01:07:55.549 --> 01:07:55.559 align:start position:0%
I think this bill needs a lot of work
 
01:07:58.010 --> 01:07:58.020 align:start position:0%
it's like a cake that's been in the oven
 
01:08:00.109 --> 01:08:00.119 align:start position:0%
for about 20 minutes it has some shape
 
01:08:03.049 --> 01:08:03.059 align:start position:0%
but it can't hold its own and it's not
 
01:08:06.170 --> 01:08:06.180 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:07.430 --> 01:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony any
 
01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:08.870 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony any
questions

01:08:08.870 --> 01:08:08.880 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:08:12.049 --> 01:08:12.059 align:start position:0%
yes representative Schmidt
 
01:08:14.569 --> 01:08:14.579 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman good morning Dr
 
01:08:18.410 --> 01:08:18.420 align:start position:0%
Phillips uh so you referenced a moment
 
01:08:20.809 --> 01:08:20.819 align:start position:0%
ago an increase from two thousand to
 
01:08:24.590 --> 01:08:24.600 align:start position:0%
three thousand is that up to 3 000 or is
 
01:08:27.709 --> 01:08:27.719 align:start position:0%
it 3 000 on the news I think it's up to
 
01:08:30.349 --> 01:08:30.359 align:start position:0%
up to yeah okay so there's some
 
01:08:32.990 --> 01:08:33.000 align:start position:0%
reflection for increased costs and so
 
01:08:35.990 --> 01:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
forth so it it could it still could be
 
01:08:39.530 --> 01:08:39.540 align:start position:0%
two it could still could be 1999 as
 
01:08:40.809 --> 01:08:40.819 align:start position:0%
opposed to
 
01:08:44.269 --> 01:08:44.279 align:start position:0%
2001 right it could be um I think in in
 
01:08:47.030 --> 01:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
many kinds of cases you'll you can have
 
01:08:48.769 --> 01:08:48.779 align:start position:0%
protection against claims like that
 
01:08:50.329 --> 01:08:50.339 align:start position:0%
where your insurance will cover the cost
 
01:08:53.510 --> 01:08:53.520 align:start position:0%
of fines I consulted with the APA trust
 
01:08:55.669 --> 01:08:55.679 align:start position:0%
who I have my malpractice insurance they
 
01:08:57.650 --> 01:08:57.660 align:start position:0%
don't cover the cost of fines and so
 
01:08:59.510 --> 01:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
that would come out of my pocket not the
 
01:09:01.430 --> 01:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
just the 3000 if I had to pay for the
 
01:09:03.410 --> 01:09:03.420 align:start position:0%
investigation my malpractice insurance
 
01:09:05.269 --> 01:09:05.279 align:start position:0%
would not cover that that would be a
 
01:09:07.430 --> 01:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
direct bill to me
 
01:09:09.950 --> 01:09:09.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:09:12.349 --> 01:09:12.359 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
01:09:13.910 --> 01:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
01:09:17.870 --> 01:09:17.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:19.729 --> 01:09:19.739 align:start position:0%
I have to apologize I can't quite make
 
01:09:21.829 --> 01:09:21.839 align:start position:0%
out the last name but Robert Wallace
 
01:09:24.289 --> 01:09:24.299 align:start position:0%
maybe board of psychology
 
01:09:29.630 --> 01:09:29.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:40.970 --> 01:09:40.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:42.169 --> 01:09:42.179 align:start position:0%
um if you could turn your microphone on
 
01:09:44.510 --> 01:09:44.520 align:start position:0%
please for us oh did I turn it up okay
 
01:09:47.329 --> 01:09:47.339 align:start position:0%
I'm Elizabeth Rupp I live in Manchester
 
01:09:49.189 --> 01:09:49.199 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I am a licensed
 
01:09:51.349 --> 01:09:51.359 align:start position:0%
acupuncturist I neither serve on the
 
01:09:52.669 --> 01:09:52.679 align:start position:0%
board nor am I part of the State
 
01:09:54.830 --> 01:09:54.840 align:start position:0%
Association I've been before this
 
01:09:56.750 --> 01:09:56.760 align:start position:0%
committee before to say that neither one
 
01:09:59.810 --> 01:09:59.820 align:start position:0%
of those organizations represent me or
 
01:10:02.450 --> 01:10:02.460 align:start position:0%
my co-workers that's why I'm here I work
 
01:10:05.350 --> 01:10:05.360 align:start position:0%
at a low-cost high volume practice
 
01:10:07.910 --> 01:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
whereas the rest of the acupuncturists
 
01:10:11.150 --> 01:10:11.160 align:start position:0%
work more in a high cost low volume
 
01:10:11.160 --> 01:10:12.410 align:start position:0%
work more in a high cost low volume
practice

01:10:12.410 --> 01:10:12.420 align:start position:0%
practice
 
01:10:14.270 --> 01:10:14.280 align:start position:0%
so I'll come to the some sub
 
01:10:16.310 --> 01:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meeting I just saw that
 
01:10:18.470 --> 01:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
acupuncture was in this bill I can't
 
01:10:20.390 --> 01:10:20.400 align:start position:0%
even find it right now because this is
 
01:10:22.070 --> 01:10:22.080 align:start position:0%
so long and I saw things were being
 
01:10:23.930 --> 01:10:23.940 align:start position:0%
repealed but I couldn't tell what so I'm
 
01:10:25.850 --> 01:10:25.860 align:start position:0%
just here to find out more
 
01:10:27.610 --> 01:10:27.620 align:start position:0%
do you have any questions
 
01:10:30.530 --> 01:10:30.540 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
01:10:36.770 --> 01:10:36.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:38.750 --> 01:10:38.760 align:start position:0%
um Kelly lootkey
 
01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:46.130 align:start position:0%
um Kelly lootkey
latke

01:10:46.130 --> 01:10:46.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:48.169 --> 01:10:48.179 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman maybe we could have people
 
01:10:50.930 --> 01:10:50.940 align:start position:0%
with somewhat unusual names spell their
 
01:10:53.030 --> 01:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
names because I don't like
 
01:10:55.430 --> 01:10:55.440 align:start position:0%
approximations in that regard would you
 
01:10:57.470 --> 01:10:57.480 align:start position:0%
mind spelling your name please that
 
01:11:00.070 --> 01:11:00.080 align:start position:0%
husband of mine gave me this name
 
01:11:05.270 --> 01:11:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:08.689 --> 01:11:08.699 align:start position:0%
K as in Kelly e is an echo can you tell
 
01:11:12.770 --> 01:11:12.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:16.250 --> 01:11:16.260 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is Kelly ludke I am
 
01:11:20.149 --> 01:11:20.159 align:start position:0%
the board chair for the laidak board
 
01:11:21.649 --> 01:11:21.659 align:start position:0%
um and I have been involved in the
 
01:11:23.330 --> 01:11:23.340 align:start position:0%
laidak board
 
01:11:23.340 --> 01:11:24.770 align:start position:0%
laidak board
probably

01:11:24.770 --> 01:11:24.780 align:start position:0%
probably
 
01:11:28.270 --> 01:11:28.280 align:start position:0%
um geez since 2011.
 
01:11:30.290 --> 01:11:30.300 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry
 
01:11:32.810 --> 01:11:32.820 align:start position:0%
um it's the board for Alcohol and Other
 
01:11:38.090 --> 01:11:38.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:39.350 --> 01:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
um so I've been involved with the board
 
01:11:42.169 --> 01:11:42.179 align:start position:0%
for since about 2011
 
01:11:44.810 --> 01:11:44.820 align:start position:0%
um but I'm testifying
 
01:11:47.810 --> 01:11:47.820 align:start position:0%
as just a licensee as an m laidac in the
 
01:11:49.790 --> 01:11:49.800 align:start position:0%
state because my board doesn't meet till
 
01:11:52.790 --> 01:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
tomorrow so I didn't get a board vote
 
01:11:55.790 --> 01:11:55.800 align:start position:0%
um I I'm going to keep this brief
 
01:11:58.970 --> 01:11:58.980 align:start position:0%
I have a few things I guess I wanted you
 
01:12:00.950 --> 01:12:00.960 align:start position:0%
all to know which is I wasn't even aware
 
01:12:04.450 --> 01:12:04.460 align:start position:0%
of this bill until about four days ago
 
01:12:08.570 --> 01:12:08.580 align:start position:0%
so that means I was never approached and
 
01:12:10.669 --> 01:12:10.679 align:start position:0%
asked for my opinion on any of this
 
01:12:13.790 --> 01:12:13.800 align:start position:0%
during the study committee so I felt a
 
01:12:17.689 --> 01:12:17.699 align:start position:0%
little blindsided by it and
 
01:12:21.410 --> 01:12:21.420 align:start position:0%
I want to say that I believe in a spirit
 
01:12:24.709 --> 01:12:24.719 align:start position:0%
of collaboration of working together
 
01:12:27.649 --> 01:12:27.659 align:start position:0%
and so the testimony that I prepared is
 
01:12:29.149 --> 01:12:29.159 align:start position:0%
written I'm not going to go through each
 
01:12:31.850 --> 01:12:31.860 align:start position:0%
of them I'll I'll submit this
 
01:12:31.860 --> 01:12:32.750 align:start position:0%
of them I'll I'll submit this
um

01:12:32.750 --> 01:12:32.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:35.870 --> 01:12:35.880 align:start position:0%
but I feel like this bill really does
 
01:12:40.270 --> 01:12:40.280 align:start position:0%
strip the authority of the laidac board
 
01:12:44.870 --> 01:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
I feel that the oplc coming in because
 
01:12:46.370 --> 01:12:46.380 align:start position:0%
when I first came on the board there was
 
01:12:49.490 --> 01:12:49.500 align:start position:0%
no oplc we met at the Bureau of drug and
 
01:12:51.470 --> 01:12:51.480 align:start position:0%
alcohol services and we did everything
 
01:12:51.480 --> 01:12:52.729 align:start position:0%
alcohol services and we did everything
ourselves

01:12:52.729 --> 01:12:52.739 align:start position:0%
ourselves
 
01:12:54.830 --> 01:12:54.840 align:start position:0%
and it was cumbersome it was burdensome
 
01:12:57.709 --> 01:12:57.719 align:start position:0%
it was difficult so when oplc came in
 
01:12:59.950 --> 01:12:59.960 align:start position:0%
and they said hey Kelly we're going to
 
01:13:02.630 --> 01:13:02.640 align:start position:0%
assign you a lawyer that you can consult
 
01:13:04.790 --> 01:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
with I'm like wow this is great we're
 
01:13:06.229 --> 01:13:06.239 align:start position:0%
going to assign somebody to do your
 
01:13:09.890 --> 01:13:09.900 align:start position:0%
investigations great I love that it
 
01:13:11.209 --> 01:13:11.219 align:start position:0%
really took a lot of Burden off the
 
01:13:11.219 --> 01:13:12.229 align:start position:0%
really took a lot of Burden off the
board

01:13:12.229 --> 01:13:12.239 align:start position:0%
board
 
01:13:12.239 --> 01:13:13.970 align:start position:0%
board
however

01:13:13.970 --> 01:13:13.980 align:start position:0%
however
 
01:13:18.110 --> 01:13:18.120 align:start position:0%
I I don't believe at this time the oplc
 
01:13:21.590 --> 01:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
is ready to take on
 
01:13:24.590 --> 01:13:24.600 align:start position:0%
all of the administrative duties that
 
01:13:28.010 --> 01:13:28.020 align:start position:0%
it's asking to do with repealing
 
01:13:31.310 --> 01:13:31.320 align:start position:0%
so many of our state statutes
 
01:13:35.270 --> 01:13:35.280 align:start position:0%
um one very quick example would be one
 
01:13:37.790 --> 01:13:37.800 align:start position:0%
of the first laws they were trying to
 
01:13:40.490 --> 01:13:40.500 align:start position:0%
repeal is the board not having the
 
01:13:45.050 --> 01:13:45.060 align:start position:0%
authority to have a advisory committee
 
01:13:47.930 --> 01:13:47.940 align:start position:0%
why what is the purpose of that we need
 
01:13:49.490 --> 01:13:49.500 align:start position:0%
our advisory committee we have one
 
01:13:51.590 --> 01:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
called the peer review committee and
 
01:13:53.330 --> 01:13:53.340 align:start position:0%
they are essential
 
01:13:55.610 --> 01:13:55.620 align:start position:0%
to getting our work done right now our
 
01:13:57.709 --> 01:13:57.719 align:start position:0%
average board meeting begins at 8 A.M
 
01:14:00.830 --> 01:14:00.840 align:start position:0%
and ends at about 5 to 6 pm
 
01:14:02.990 --> 01:14:03.000 align:start position:0%
we're volunteers we all work full-time
 
01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:04.310 align:start position:0%
we're volunteers we all work full-time
jobs

01:14:04.310 --> 01:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
jobs
 
01:14:05.810 --> 01:14:05.820 align:start position:0%
if we didn't have our peer review
 
01:14:09.169 --> 01:14:09.179 align:start position:0%
committee to review all new applications
 
01:14:12.950 --> 01:14:12.960 align:start position:0%
for laidac and laidac crsw and LCS
 
01:14:15.770 --> 01:14:15.780 align:start position:0%
we'd probably be there until midnight I
 
01:14:17.750 --> 01:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
mean this this is an essential committee
 
01:14:21.110 --> 01:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
to us and there's a lot there's um in
 
01:14:23.270 --> 01:14:23.280 align:start position:0%
this bill they want to repeal us being
 
01:14:24.950 --> 01:14:24.960 align:start position:0%
able to establish those advisory
 
01:14:27.050 --> 01:14:27.060 align:start position:0%
committees that doesn't make any sense
 
01:14:30.590 --> 01:14:30.600 align:start position:0%
to me there are other things where they
 
01:14:34.130 --> 01:14:34.140 align:start position:0%
want to take our rights away our duty
 
01:14:36.709 --> 01:14:36.719 align:start position:0%
our authority to conduct our own
 
01:14:36.719 --> 01:14:38.330 align:start position:0%
our authority to conduct our own
investigations

01:14:38.330 --> 01:14:38.340 align:start position:0%
investigations
 
01:14:40.430 --> 01:14:40.440 align:start position:0%
right now
 
01:14:43.130 --> 01:14:43.140 align:start position:0%
I I believe that our investigations
 
01:14:47.330 --> 01:14:47.340 align:start position:0%
oftentimes need a person with expertise
 
01:14:50.810 --> 01:14:50.820 align:start position:0%
to maybe work collaboratively on the
 
01:14:50.820 --> 01:14:52.430 align:start position:0%
to maybe work collaboratively on the
investigation

01:14:52.430 --> 01:14:52.440 align:start position:0%
investigation
 
01:14:54.830 --> 01:14:54.840 align:start position:0%
and I really think the work that the
 
01:14:56.570 --> 01:14:56.580 align:start position:0%
oplc has been doing has been wonderful
 
01:14:58.430 --> 01:14:58.440 align:start position:0%
I'm not here to say anything bad about
 
01:15:00.410 --> 01:15:00.420 align:start position:0%
anybody except
 
01:15:03.050 --> 01:15:03.060 align:start position:0%
I think we can work together I don't
 
01:15:05.330 --> 01:15:05.340 align:start position:0%
think we need to repeal State statutes
 
01:15:08.209 --> 01:15:08.219 align:start position:0%
to get the work done
 
01:15:08.219 --> 01:15:08.990 align:start position:0%
to get the work done
um

01:15:08.990 --> 01:15:09.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:13.550 --> 01:15:13.560 align:start position:0%
I think there was some testimony around
 
01:15:17.810 --> 01:15:17.820 align:start position:0%
this being streamlined because
 
01:15:20.350 --> 01:15:20.360 align:start position:0%
there tends to be delays from the board
 
01:15:22.970 --> 01:15:22.980 align:start position:0%
and frankly that kind of hit me in the
 
01:15:25.610 --> 01:15:25.620 align:start position:0%
heart because I thought what I've given
 
01:15:28.189 --> 01:15:28.199 align:start position:0%
investigation my cell phone number told
 
01:15:30.830 --> 01:15:30.840 align:start position:0%
them to call me any time of the day with
 
01:15:32.450 --> 01:15:32.460 align:start position:0%
any questions and anything they ever
 
01:15:32.460 --> 01:15:34.189 align:start position:0%
any questions and anything they ever
needed

01:15:34.189 --> 01:15:34.199 align:start position:0%
needed
 
01:15:34.199 --> 01:15:34.850 align:start position:0%
needed
um

01:15:34.850 --> 01:15:34.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:38.030 --> 01:15:38.040 align:start position:0%
so that doesn't it doesn't feel accurate
 
01:15:40.070 --> 01:15:40.080 align:start position:0%
to me I feel like there's a lot more to
 
01:15:43.070 --> 01:15:43.080 align:start position:0%
say around each and every statue that
 
01:15:45.169 --> 01:15:45.179 align:start position:0%
they're asking to repeal but again I'll
 
01:15:46.610 --> 01:15:46.620 align:start position:0%
keep that
 
01:15:48.709 --> 01:15:48.719 align:start position:0%
in written testimony
 
01:15:50.330 --> 01:15:50.340 align:start position:0%
and I don't even know if I'm in
 
01:15:52.070 --> 01:15:52.080 align:start position:0%
opposition of the whole bill I can only
 
01:15:53.930 --> 01:15:53.940 align:start position:0%
say what I know about the laidac board
 
01:15:55.610 --> 01:15:55.620 align:start position:0%
you know I don't know what every other
 
01:15:57.950 --> 01:15:57.960 align:start position:0%
board does so I can't say I'm 100 in
 
01:16:00.350 --> 01:16:00.360 align:start position:0%
opposition but I'm in opposition to
 
01:16:02.209 --> 01:16:02.219 align:start position:0%
every single one of the state statutes
 
01:16:03.649 --> 01:16:03.659 align:start position:0%
they want to repeal
 
01:16:06.290 --> 01:16:06.300 align:start position:0%
for the late deck board
 
01:16:08.450 --> 01:16:08.460 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for your testimony
 
01:16:10.310 --> 01:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
will you take questions
 
01:16:14.209 --> 01:16:14.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:19.669 --> 01:16:19.679 align:start position:0%

01:17:33.590 --> 01:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
to the Board of Medicine and I'm
 
01:17:36.970 --> 01:17:36.980 align:start position:0%
testifying in support of the the
 
01:17:39.709 --> 01:17:39.719 align:start position:0%
legislation broadly and specifically
 
01:17:41.990 --> 01:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
want to talk about why it will be
 
01:17:44.149 --> 01:17:44.159 align:start position:0%
helpful in improving the functioning of
 
01:17:46.030 --> 01:17:46.040 align:start position:0%
the Board of Medicine
 
01:17:49.310 --> 01:17:49.320 align:start position:0%
as you all may be aware from the
 
01:17:51.950 --> 01:17:51.960 align:start position:0%
articles in the Boston Globe and the
 
01:17:53.810 --> 01:17:53.820 align:start position:0%
Manchester Union leader this summer
 
01:17:58.250 --> 01:17:58.260 align:start position:0%
about a surgeon who had over 20
 
01:18:00.770 --> 01:18:00.780 align:start position:0%
malpractice cases against him but had
 
01:18:03.470 --> 01:18:03.480 align:start position:0%
had no action taken against him by the
 
01:18:05.930 --> 01:18:05.940 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Board of Medicine the
 
01:18:08.390 --> 01:18:08.400 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine is not functioning
 
01:18:12.350 --> 01:18:12.360 align:start position:0%
well the globe Spotlight series looked
 
01:18:15.649 --> 01:18:15.659 align:start position:0%
at the rates of attorney excuse me of
 
01:18:17.810 --> 01:18:17.820 align:start position:0%
physician discipline across the country
 
01:18:20.689 --> 01:18:20.699 align:start position:0%
and found that New Hampshire has the
 
01:18:23.689 --> 01:18:23.699 align:start position:0%
lowest rate of new of a physician
 
01:18:26.990 --> 01:18:27.000 align:start position:0%
discipline in the entire nation and with
 
01:18:29.689 --> 01:18:29.699 align:start position:0%
respect to the surgeon who was the focus
 
01:18:31.330 --> 01:18:31.340 align:start position:0%
of that Spotlight
 
01:18:34.790 --> 01:18:34.800 align:start position:0%
investigation there was no other surgeon
 
01:18:37.189 --> 01:18:37.199 align:start position:0%
in the country who had had as many
 
01:18:39.229 --> 01:18:39.239 align:start position:0%
malpractice claims brought against him
 
01:18:41.870 --> 01:18:41.880 align:start position:0%
so there's something wrong with how the
 
01:18:43.310 --> 01:18:43.320 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine is currently
 
01:18:45.770 --> 01:18:45.780 align:start position:0%
functioning and I think when the folks
 
01:18:48.530 --> 01:18:48.540 align:start position:0%
from the oplc were up here they
 
01:18:50.689 --> 01:18:50.699 align:start position:0%
mentioned that the Board of Medicine has
 
01:18:53.390 --> 01:18:53.400 align:start position:0%
actually been treated differently and so
 
01:18:57.890 --> 01:18:57.900 align:start position:0%
the rules of the oplc the the rules that
 
01:19:01.970 --> 01:19:01.980 align:start position:0%
this statute would apply would bring the
 
01:19:05.169 --> 01:19:05.179 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine process into
 
01:19:08.090 --> 01:19:08.100 align:start position:0%
conformance with the process that's
 
01:19:11.330 --> 01:19:11.340 align:start position:0%
applied to other boards and I think the
 
01:19:13.970 --> 01:19:13.980 align:start position:0%
problem that has existed with a board of
 
01:19:16.250 --> 01:19:16.260 align:start position:0%
medicine is really a result of the fact
 
01:19:17.990 --> 01:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
that they've been treated differently
 
01:19:23.810 --> 01:19:23.820 align:start position:0%
they've had a system where they from
 
01:19:27.550 --> 01:19:27.560 align:start position:0%
start to finish have discretion
 
01:19:31.550 --> 01:19:31.560 align:start position:0%
to police themselves and I think all of
 
01:19:33.290 --> 01:19:33.300 align:start position:0%
us know all of us have had the
 
01:19:35.689 --> 01:19:35.699 align:start position:0%
experience that it's hard to call a
 
01:19:39.070 --> 01:19:39.080 align:start position:0%
colleague out it's hard to
 
01:19:43.070 --> 01:19:43.080 align:start position:0%
say to a colleague or impose some
 
01:19:43.080 --> 01:19:44.270 align:start position:0%
say to a colleague or impose some
um

01:19:44.270 --> 01:19:44.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:46.610 --> 01:19:46.620 align:start position:0%
punishment on a colleague that's
 
01:19:48.350 --> 01:19:48.360 align:start position:0%
something really difficult to do when I
 
01:19:50.570 --> 01:19:50.580 align:start position:0%
was teaching at the law school I
 
01:19:53.570 --> 01:19:53.580 align:start position:0%
remember teaching big classes 150
 
01:19:56.689 --> 01:19:56.699 align:start position:0%
students and at time the time it came to
 
01:19:58.669 --> 01:19:58.679 align:start position:0%
be doing the grading for a very
 
01:20:01.189 --> 01:20:01.199 align:start position:0%
foundational course that was a real
 
01:20:04.970 --> 01:20:04.980 align:start position:0%
screen for who was competent to become a
 
01:20:07.130 --> 01:20:07.140 align:start position:0%
lawyer and who wasn't I was going to
 
01:20:09.110 --> 01:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
need to fail people
 
01:20:09.120 --> 01:20:10.610 align:start position:0%
need to fail people
and

01:20:10.610 --> 01:20:10.620 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:20:13.250 --> 01:20:13.260 align:start position:0%
my grading the grading at the law school
 
01:20:14.810 --> 01:20:14.820 align:start position:0%
was anonymous
 
01:20:20.030 --> 01:20:20.040 align:start position:0%
it was far easier for me to honestly and
 
01:20:23.090 --> 01:20:23.100 align:start position:0%
objectively grade an exam when I didn't
 
01:20:25.130 --> 01:20:25.140 align:start position:0%
know whose it was
 
01:20:28.310 --> 01:20:28.320 align:start position:0%
and I think that's what this process is
 
01:20:29.990 --> 01:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
going to bring to the Board of Medicine
 
01:20:33.669 --> 01:20:33.679 align:start position:0%
it's going to take that original
 
01:20:37.729 --> 01:20:37.739 align:start position:0%
screening the complaint will come in and
 
01:20:40.790 --> 01:20:40.800 align:start position:0%
be handled by the office of professional
 
01:20:44.390 --> 01:20:44.400 align:start position:0%
licensure and certification instead of
 
01:20:47.450 --> 01:20:47.460 align:start position:0%
the medical review subcommittee of The
 
01:20:49.610 --> 01:20:49.620 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine which is where that
 
01:20:53.450 --> 01:20:53.460 align:start position:0%
current initial screening happens and
 
01:20:55.610 --> 01:20:55.620 align:start position:0%
the medical review subcommittee is a
 
01:20:57.370 --> 01:20:57.380 align:start position:0%
committee made up of volunteers
 
01:21:01.729 --> 01:21:01.739 align:start position:0%
Physicians it's a small committee and
 
01:21:04.729 --> 01:21:04.739 align:start position:0%
they often don't have the expertise the
 
01:21:06.590 --> 01:21:06.600 align:start position:0%
members of the committee don't have the
 
01:21:10.790 --> 01:21:10.800 align:start position:0%
expertise to actually be evaluating the
 
01:21:13.729 --> 01:21:13.739 align:start position:0%
conduct of the physician involved in the
 
01:21:15.830 --> 01:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
complaint you might have a psychologist
 
01:21:20.030 --> 01:21:20.040 align:start position:0%
looking at a Cardiology claim
 
01:21:22.850 --> 01:21:22.860 align:start position:0%
um by bringing all of this into the oplc
 
01:21:26.990 --> 01:21:27.000 align:start position:0%
having oplc uh do the first level of
 
01:21:30.350 --> 01:21:30.360 align:start position:0%
screening bring in people with subject
 
01:21:33.110 --> 01:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
matter expertise for that uh
 
01:21:35.450 --> 01:21:35.460 align:start position:0%
investigation and then hand it to the
 
01:21:38.330 --> 01:21:38.340 align:start position:0%
board of medicine for a determination of
 
01:21:41.870 --> 01:21:41.880 align:start position:0%
whether it goes further and uh having
 
01:21:44.770 --> 01:21:44.780 align:start position:0%
somebody a professional and unbiased
 
01:21:49.850 --> 01:21:49.860 align:start position:0%
person from the oplc making a decision
 
01:21:53.689 --> 01:21:53.699 align:start position:0%
about how best to prosecute that claim
 
01:21:56.450 --> 01:21:56.460 align:start position:0%
in front of the Board of Medicine that's
 
01:21:58.970 --> 01:21:58.980 align:start position:0%
an objective person kind of serving in
 
01:22:01.750 --> 01:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
the role of the prosecutor of the claim
 
01:22:04.070 --> 01:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
I think we're going to get better
 
01:22:06.590 --> 01:22:06.600 align:start position:0%
outcomes from the Board of Medicine so
 
01:22:06.600 --> 01:22:08.030 align:start position:0%
outcomes from the Board of Medicine so
the

01:22:08.030 --> 01:22:08.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:22:11.510 --> 01:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
effort in this legislation to bring the
 
01:22:15.410 --> 01:22:15.420 align:start position:0%
board of medicines processes into line
 
01:22:18.950 --> 01:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
with those of the other boards will I
 
01:22:21.970 --> 01:22:21.980 align:start position:0%
think improve the quality of the
 
01:22:25.729 --> 01:22:25.739 align:start position:0%
evaluation of physician conduct that the
 
01:22:28.310 --> 01:22:28.320 align:start position:0%
board has to undertake
 
01:22:31.070 --> 01:22:31.080 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to take questions thank you
 
01:22:32.990 --> 01:22:33.000 align:start position:0%
so much any questions
 
01:22:35.810 --> 01:22:35.820 align:start position:0%
yes representative Schmidt
 
01:22:38.810 --> 01:22:38.820 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for your
 
01:22:41.090 --> 01:22:41.100 align:start position:0%
somewhat disconcerting testimony with
 
01:22:45.229 --> 01:22:45.239 align:start position:0%
regard to the Board of Medicine but
 
01:22:45.239 --> 01:22:45.950 align:start position:0%
regard to the Board of Medicine but
um

01:22:45.950 --> 01:22:45.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:49.729 --> 01:22:49.739 align:start position:0%
and you've highlighted uh advantages in
 
01:22:53.090 --> 01:22:53.100 align:start position:0%
the in the contemplated process of this
 
01:22:56.990 --> 01:22:57.000 align:start position:0%
bill uh do you see any any deficits with
 
01:22:58.490 --> 01:22:58.500 align:start position:0%
regard to some of the issues that have
 
01:23:01.729 --> 01:23:01.739 align:start position:0%
been raised by previous Witnesses
 
01:23:05.450 --> 01:23:05.460 align:start position:0%
I have not looked uh specifically at
 
01:23:08.169 --> 01:23:08.179 align:start position:0%
issues relating to the psychology board
 
01:23:11.630 --> 01:23:11.640 align:start position:0%
the social worker board or the board
 
01:23:14.390 --> 01:23:14.400 align:start position:0%
relating to alcohol practitioners or
 
01:23:17.870 --> 01:23:17.880 align:start position:0%
electricians but I would say that from
 
01:23:20.689 --> 01:23:20.699 align:start position:0%
what I know of the board of medicines
 
01:23:20.699 --> 01:23:22.630 align:start position:0%
what I know of the board of medicines
um

01:23:22.630 --> 01:23:22.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:25.790 --> 01:23:25.800 align:start position:0%
processes I don't anticipate that there
 
01:23:27.470 --> 01:23:27.480 align:start position:0%
would be issues with confidentiality
 
01:23:29.450 --> 01:23:29.460 align:start position:0%
which is what came up and I think would
 
01:23:32.630 --> 01:23:32.640 align:start position:0%
be you know of concern I didn't see
 
01:23:35.390 --> 01:23:35.400 align:start position:0%
anything in the bill that made me think
 
01:23:38.090 --> 01:23:38.100 align:start position:0%
that there was a risk of
 
01:23:40.250 --> 01:23:40.260 align:start position:0%
um confidential information becoming
 
01:23:42.410 --> 01:23:42.420 align:start position:0%
public that the board can still do
 
01:23:44.810 --> 01:23:44.820 align:start position:0%
everything it would do now if it was
 
01:23:47.750 --> 01:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
holding a public hearing to protect the
 
01:23:49.970 --> 01:23:49.980 align:start position:0%
confidentiality of the patient making
 
01:23:52.790 --> 01:23:52.800 align:start position:0%
the claim so that didn't seem like an
 
01:23:54.290 --> 01:23:54.300 align:start position:0%
issue to me
 
01:23:58.490 --> 01:23:58.500 align:start position:0%
yep follow up thank you so uh your
 
01:24:01.729 --> 01:24:01.739 align:start position:0%
experience uh that you alluded to uh
 
01:24:05.030 --> 01:24:05.040 align:start position:0%
your background uh would make you I
 
01:24:07.790 --> 01:24:07.800 align:start position:0%
think a valuable member of the uh the
 
01:24:11.209 --> 01:24:11.219 align:start position:0%
pool of of uh
 
01:24:11.219 --> 01:24:12.350 align:start position:0%
pool of of uh
of

01:24:12.350 --> 01:24:12.360 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:24:14.330 --> 01:24:14.340 align:start position:0%
um people involved in the subcommittee
 
01:24:16.370 --> 01:24:16.380 align:start position:0%
workshop that we will be having on
 
01:24:18.709 --> 01:24:18.719 align:start position:0%

01:24:25.850 --> 01:24:25.860 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
01:24:27.649 --> 01:24:27.659 align:start position:0%
sing none thank you very much all right
 
01:24:29.930 --> 01:24:29.940 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:24:44.990 --> 01:24:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:47.330 --> 01:24:47.340 align:start position:0%
good morning or afternoon no still
 
01:24:49.970 --> 01:24:49.980 align:start position:0%
morning committee chair members my name
 
01:24:51.890 --> 01:24:51.900 align:start position:0%
is Stephen ranquet I'm a licensed
 
01:24:52.910 --> 01:24:52.920 align:start position:0%
electrician in state of New Hampshire
 
01:24:55.430 --> 01:24:55.440 align:start position:0%
and I'm also the executive director of
 
01:24:56.689 --> 01:24:56.699 align:start position:0%
the electrical contract is Business
 
01:24:58.790 --> 01:24:58.800 align:start position:0%
Association I'm here representing them
 
01:25:00.470 --> 01:25:00.480 align:start position:0%
as well
 
01:25:02.030 --> 01:25:02.040 align:start position:0%
um I did take quite a bit of time to go
 
01:25:03.530 --> 01:25:03.540 align:start position:0%
through the um the bill and make some
 
01:25:05.810 --> 01:25:05.820 align:start position:0%
notes and I don't think you guys want to
 
01:25:07.010 --> 01:25:07.020 align:start position:0%
hear it all right now so we'll probably
 
01:25:08.689 --> 01:25:08.699 align:start position:0%
save that for some committee maybe I'll
 
01:25:10.729 --> 01:25:10.739 align:start position:0%
get some brownie points for that
 
01:25:12.110 --> 01:25:12.120 align:start position:0%
um I did have a few points that I wanted
 
01:25:14.390 --> 01:25:14.400 align:start position:0%
to make and I'll kind of just put them
 
01:25:15.709 --> 01:25:15.719 align:start position:0%
out there and then whether they want to
 
01:25:17.330 --> 01:25:17.340 align:start position:0%
have some questions discuss them or go
 
01:25:19.610 --> 01:25:19.620 align:start position:0%
to subcommittee we can do
 
01:25:22.070 --> 01:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
um some of the concerns that have been
 
01:25:24.590 --> 01:25:24.600 align:start position:0%
brought up or we we Echo as well the the
 
01:25:25.850 --> 01:25:25.860 align:start position:0%
um concerns of allegations and
 
01:25:25.860 --> 01:25:27.169 align:start position:0%
um concerns of allegations and
complaints

01:25:27.169 --> 01:25:27.179 align:start position:0%
complaints
 
01:25:28.970 --> 01:25:28.980 align:start position:0%
um just a brief brief little stories
 
01:25:30.470 --> 01:25:30.480 align:start position:0%
talk what happened to me we have this
 
01:25:32.330 --> 01:25:32.340 align:start position:0%
allegation to complaint we're concerned
 
01:25:33.590 --> 01:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
about how it's treated if you just have
 
01:25:35.689 --> 01:25:35.699 align:start position:0%
a standard and they don't have the
 
01:25:37.430 --> 01:25:37.440 align:start position:0%
impact of the uh or consult from the
 
01:25:39.229 --> 01:25:39.239 align:start position:0%
board or somebody because a complaint
 
01:25:40.970 --> 01:25:40.980 align:start position:0%
was issued against me some years ago
 
01:25:43.850 --> 01:25:43.860 align:start position:0%
they called up the state they complained
 
01:25:45.950 --> 01:25:45.960 align:start position:0%
about me and they uh I got a call from
 
01:25:47.270 --> 01:25:47.280 align:start position:0%
the state inspector
 
01:25:49.189 --> 01:25:49.199 align:start position:0%
we discussed the situation I explained
 
01:25:51.649 --> 01:25:51.659 align:start position:0%
to him and what happened is the customer
 
01:25:53.689 --> 01:25:53.699 align:start position:0%
I was hired by a contractor I was
 
01:25:55.310 --> 01:25:55.320 align:start position:0%
working for the contractor the
 
01:25:56.930 --> 01:25:56.940 align:start position:0%
contractor did not call me back to go
 
01:25:58.189 --> 01:25:58.199 align:start position:0%
and finish the electrical work because
 
01:26:00.530 --> 01:26:00.540 align:start position:0%
he wasn't getting paid
 
01:26:03.410 --> 01:26:03.420 align:start position:0%
the homeowner called the state and
 
01:26:05.030 --> 01:26:05.040 align:start position:0%
complained and put an allegation against
 
01:26:08.570 --> 01:26:08.580 align:start position:0%
me and I had to go and and protect and
 
01:26:10.430 --> 01:26:10.440 align:start position:0%
defend myself and explain to him that
 
01:26:13.370 --> 01:26:13.380 align:start position:0%
and we came to a compromise but you know
 
01:26:16.250 --> 01:26:16.260 align:start position:0%
an allegation or a complaint has to have
 
01:26:16.260 --> 01:26:17.209 align:start position:0%
an allegation or a complaint has to have
some

01:26:17.209 --> 01:26:17.219 align:start position:0%
some
 
01:26:20.689 --> 01:26:20.699 align:start position:0%
um some Merit to it in the boards are
 
01:26:23.450 --> 01:26:23.460 align:start position:0%
the most qualified to do that if you
 
01:26:25.970 --> 01:26:25.980 align:start position:0%
start a process that just is here's what
 
01:26:28.550 --> 01:26:28.560 align:start position:0%
we do ABCD it takes away that
 
01:26:30.830 --> 01:26:30.840 align:start position:0%
information and that knowledge this was
 
01:26:33.050 --> 01:26:33.060 align:start position:0%
simply about money he wasn't paying the
 
01:26:34.550 --> 01:26:34.560 align:start position:0%
contractor and he was trying to force me
 
01:26:36.830 --> 01:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
to finish and he went and had some other
 
01:26:39.169 --> 01:26:39.179 align:start position:0%
people do some work the Well Company and
 
01:26:41.209 --> 01:26:41.219 align:start position:0%
left a mess and they put that on my
 
01:26:44.510 --> 01:26:44.520 align:start position:0%
complaint so just as an example there's
 
01:26:46.610 --> 01:26:46.620 align:start position:0%
a lot more to it than just I file you
 
01:26:47.870 --> 01:26:47.880 align:start position:0%
know somebody files a complaint if you
 
01:26:50.390 --> 01:26:50.400 align:start position:0%
file a complaint on allegation and
 
01:26:53.570 --> 01:26:53.580 align:start position:0%
it's not it's the board decides it
 
01:26:55.550 --> 01:26:55.560 align:start position:0%
wasn't you weren't wrong you didn't do
 
01:26:57.290 --> 01:26:57.300 align:start position:0%
anything what happens to all that
 
01:26:58.610 --> 01:26:58.620 align:start position:0%
paperwork and information from
 
01:27:00.410 --> 01:27:00.420 align:start position:0%
confidentially does it get expunged
 
01:27:02.030 --> 01:27:02.040 align:start position:0%
stuff like that right so there's a lot
 
01:27:04.910 --> 01:27:04.920 align:start position:0%
with that whole issue that's concerned
 
01:27:06.649 --> 01:27:06.659 align:start position:0%
um without getting the input from the
 
01:27:08.209 --> 01:27:08.219 align:start position:0%
board again which goes back to what
 
01:27:09.770 --> 01:27:09.780 align:start position:0%
they're repealing the board's Authority
 
01:27:11.330 --> 01:27:11.340 align:start position:0%
so to speak when they talk about
 
01:27:13.070 --> 01:27:13.080 align:start position:0%
repealing the authority and there's
 
01:27:14.390 --> 01:27:14.400 align:start position:0%
still plenty there yeah they're taking
 
01:27:15.950 --> 01:27:15.960 align:start position:0%
all the meat and potatoes you know
 
01:27:17.810 --> 01:27:17.820 align:start position:0%
they're just it's showpiece at this
 
01:27:19.610 --> 01:27:19.620 align:start position:0%
point when you start taking half of this
 
01:27:22.189 --> 01:27:22.199 align:start position:0%
away the rulemaking authority the fees
 
01:27:24.229 --> 01:27:24.239 align:start position:0%
license renewal disciplinary action
 
01:27:26.689 --> 01:27:26.699 align:start position:0%
hearings appeals investigations I mean
 
01:27:30.110 --> 01:27:30.120 align:start position:0%
you know you can see what the board has
 
01:27:31.729 --> 01:27:31.739 align:start position:0%
and the highlighted ones of what they're
 
01:27:32.810 --> 01:27:32.820 align:start position:0%
taking away
 
01:27:35.629 --> 01:27:35.639 align:start position:0%
provide that I'm sorry but so that needs
 
01:27:37.490 --> 01:27:37.500 align:start position:0%
to be looked at a little better
 
01:27:39.649 --> 01:27:39.659 align:start position:0%
um it's not a one size fit all fits all
 
01:27:41.450 --> 01:27:41.460 align:start position:0%
for this
 
01:27:41.460 --> 01:27:42.770 align:start position:0%
for this
the

01:27:42.770 --> 01:27:42.780 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:27:44.930 --> 01:27:44.940 align:start position:0%
every word is different we've had pretty
 
01:27:46.310 --> 01:27:46.320 align:start position:0%
good luck as our board not having some
 
01:27:47.149 --> 01:27:47.159 align:start position:0%
of the issues that have been brought
 
01:27:50.090 --> 01:27:50.100 align:start position:0%
forth to you and we think that it's
 
01:27:51.890 --> 01:27:51.900 align:start position:0%
going to be difficult to do use the one
 
01:27:54.590 --> 01:27:54.600 align:start position:0%
size fits all to to fix this completely
 
01:27:57.410 --> 01:27:57.420 align:start position:0%
the confidentiality who has access to it
 
01:27:59.990 --> 01:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
does every employee in oplc have access
 
01:28:01.970 --> 01:28:01.980 align:start position:0%
to it how does that work and I'm sure
 
01:28:03.590 --> 01:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
the people behind us can explain that
 
01:28:04.970 --> 01:28:04.980 align:start position:0%
again these are just questions that
 
01:28:06.950 --> 01:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
we're concerned about there's a lot more
 
01:28:08.870 --> 01:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
employees in oplc than we used to have
 
01:28:10.850 --> 01:28:10.860 align:start position:0%
on our board electricians board right we
 
01:28:13.189 --> 01:28:13.199 align:start position:0%
had two one maybe two people who did the
 
01:28:13.199 --> 01:28:14.209 align:start position:0%
had two one maybe two people who did the
admin

01:28:14.209 --> 01:28:14.219 align:start position:0%
admin
 
01:28:15.890 --> 01:28:15.900 align:start position:0%
that's all that might have access to it
 
01:28:19.010 --> 01:28:19.020 align:start position:0%
for us now is there a hundred people in
 
01:28:21.709 --> 01:28:21.719 align:start position:0%
oplc that has access to all this or does
 
01:28:23.209 --> 01:28:23.219 align:start position:0%
it stay under the investigations and
 
01:28:25.250 --> 01:28:25.260 align:start position:0%
only a few people
 
01:28:26.810 --> 01:28:26.820 align:start position:0%
um some concerns with the turnover and
 
01:28:29.570 --> 01:28:29.580 align:start position:0%
just the because of the size of oplc had
 
01:28:31.669 --> 01:28:31.679 align:start position:0%
a discussion with someone that the other
 
01:28:33.110 --> 01:28:33.120 align:start position:0%
day that a couple weeks back they had a
 
01:28:34.490 --> 01:28:34.500 align:start position:0%
meeting almost 50 percent of the
 
01:28:36.290 --> 01:28:36.300 align:start position:0%
employees are new
 
01:28:37.970 --> 01:28:37.980 align:start position:0%
what do they know about electrical
 
01:28:40.490 --> 01:28:40.500 align:start position:0%
health profession medical and they're
 
01:28:42.350 --> 01:28:42.360 align:start position:0%
processing this just based on this
 
01:28:44.270 --> 01:28:44.280 align:start position:0%
agenda while we think the procedure in
 
01:28:46.030 --> 01:28:46.040 align:start position:0%
trying to get consistent is important
 
01:28:48.770 --> 01:28:48.780 align:start position:0%
there's got to be a fine line
 
01:28:48.780 --> 01:28:49.570 align:start position:0%
there's got to be a fine line
um

01:28:49.570 --> 01:28:49.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:53.090 --> 01:28:53.100 align:start position:0%
balancing the the political and Justice
 
01:28:54.590 --> 01:28:54.600 align:start position:0%
as well as the administrative Simplicity
 
01:28:57.410 --> 01:28:57.420 align:start position:0%
as mentioned earlier is very important
 
01:28:59.390 --> 01:28:59.400 align:start position:0%
um maybe breaking up into three sections
 
01:29:00.950 --> 01:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
like representative emmentine mentioned
 
01:29:03.290 --> 01:29:03.300 align:start position:0%
so that maybe some of the laws apply to
 
01:29:05.030 --> 01:29:05.040 align:start position:0%
the three different sections and it's
 
01:29:07.610 --> 01:29:07.620 align:start position:0%
still somewhat easy to administer
 
01:29:09.590 --> 01:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
um fines are in there you know and
 
01:29:10.610 --> 01:29:10.620 align:start position:0%
that's something new you talk about
 
01:29:11.990 --> 01:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
three thousand dollars and fines for a
 
01:29:13.970 --> 01:29:13.980 align:start position:0%
licensed electrician depending on but
 
01:29:16.070 --> 01:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
they're not as stiff for the
 
01:29:18.410 --> 01:29:18.420 align:start position:0%
non-electricians when they do an
 
01:29:22.010 --> 01:29:22.020 align:start position:0%
investigation what do employees from the
 
01:29:25.729 --> 01:29:25.739 align:start position:0%
oplc know about wire rating termination
 
01:29:28.910 --> 01:29:28.920 align:start position:0%
or installation methods they don't but
 
01:29:29.990 --> 01:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
they're going to determine whether this
 
01:29:32.209 --> 01:29:32.219 align:start position:0%
is a just cause and then do we need to
 
01:29:33.890 --> 01:29:33.900 align:start position:0%
hire somebody it's in there in the bill
 
01:29:35.629 --> 01:29:35.639 align:start position:0%
they can hire somebody when our board
 
01:29:37.070 --> 01:29:37.080 align:start position:0%
has the expertise with our state
 
01:29:39.169 --> 01:29:39.179 align:start position:0%
inspectors we have licensed electricians
 
01:29:42.350 --> 01:29:42.360 align:start position:0%
on the board and as many other boards do
 
01:29:44.510 --> 01:29:44.520 align:start position:0%
um the
 
01:29:46.729 --> 01:29:46.739 align:start position:0%
content expert again I think that our
 
01:29:48.470 --> 01:29:48.480 align:start position:0%
board can provide that and don't
 
01:29:49.669 --> 01:29:49.679 align:start position:0%
necessarily need to be hiring somebody
 
01:29:51.050 --> 01:29:51.060 align:start position:0%
every time so those are some of the
 
01:29:53.629 --> 01:29:53.639 align:start position:0%
changes and just again that it's you
 
01:29:55.970 --> 01:29:55.980 align:start position:0%
know it seems like 10 10 of the boards
 
01:29:58.070 --> 01:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
that are having problems are affecting
 
01:29:59.629 --> 01:29:59.639 align:start position:0%
90 of the boards that don't and
 
01:30:01.610 --> 01:30:01.620 align:start position:0%
hopefully we find a compromise in there
 
01:30:03.410 --> 01:30:03.420 align:start position:0%
we don't disagree with the
 
01:30:04.610 --> 01:30:04.620 align:start position:0%
administrative part and trying to make
 
01:30:06.830 --> 01:30:06.840 align:start position:0%
it consistent and find some methods but
 
01:30:08.390 --> 01:30:08.400 align:start position:0%
we feel that there's some middle ground
 
01:30:10.550 --> 01:30:10.560 align:start position:0%
that needs to be addressed and uh we'll
 
01:30:13.010 --> 01:30:13.020 align:start position:0%
conclude thank you for your testimony
 
01:30:14.149 --> 01:30:14.159 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
01:30:17.090 --> 01:30:17.100 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
01:30:20.330 --> 01:30:20.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:22.610 --> 01:30:22.620 align:start position:0%
I get exactly
 
01:30:24.110 --> 01:30:24.120 align:start position:0%
what you're saying a little active
 
01:30:26.450 --> 01:30:26.460 align:start position:0%
listening is that you're you're saying
 
01:30:29.689 --> 01:30:29.699 align:start position:0%
that the Board needs to be part of that
 
01:30:29.699 --> 01:30:31.129 align:start position:0%
that the Board needs to be part of that
process

01:30:31.129 --> 01:30:31.139 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:30:35.330 --> 01:30:35.340 align:start position:0%
and if there was something
 
01:30:38.450 --> 01:30:38.460 align:start position:0%
added to say that an appointed board
 
01:30:42.010 --> 01:30:42.020 align:start position:0%
member would ride the investigation with
 
01:30:45.410 --> 01:30:45.420 align:start position:0%
oplc would that be
 
01:30:47.390 --> 01:30:47.400 align:start position:0%
would that
 
01:30:49.910 --> 01:30:49.920 align:start position:0%
make this better it would definitely
 
01:30:51.169 --> 01:30:51.179 align:start position:0%
help I think we'd have to see the
 
01:30:52.970 --> 01:30:52.980 align:start position:0%
wording because does it also talk about
 
01:30:54.110 --> 01:30:54.120 align:start position:0%
from the very beginning of the
 
01:30:56.149 --> 01:30:56.159 align:start position:0%
allegation you know with somebody you
 
01:30:58.790 --> 01:30:58.800 align:start position:0%
know when my my particular situation the
 
01:31:00.110 --> 01:31:00.120 align:start position:0%
state inspector Chief electrical
 
01:31:01.250 --> 01:31:01.260 align:start position:0%
inspector is the one that called me I
 
01:31:02.930 --> 01:31:02.940 align:start position:0%
explained to him the situation he
 
01:31:04.790 --> 01:31:04.800 align:start position:0%
understood what was going on and he
 
01:31:06.530 --> 01:31:06.540 align:start position:0%
simply asked me will you go take care of
 
01:31:09.350 --> 01:31:09.360 align:start position:0%
that so we can just put it to bed so I
 
01:31:11.090 --> 01:31:11.100 align:start position:0%
went back and finished it for free and
 
01:31:13.790 --> 01:31:13.800 align:start position:0%
did stuff just to make it right but so
 
01:31:15.470 --> 01:31:15.480 align:start position:0%
at the very beginning as well I guess
 
01:31:19.250 --> 01:31:19.260 align:start position:0%
not just that during it
 
01:31:19.260 --> 01:31:20.990 align:start position:0%
not just that during it
follow-up

01:31:20.990 --> 01:31:21.000 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:25.310 align:start position:0%
follow-up
follow-up

01:31:25.310 --> 01:31:25.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:27.830 --> 01:31:27.840 align:start position:0%
I can absolutely understand why it's
 
01:31:29.689 --> 01:31:29.699 align:start position:0%
essential to have somebody that's from
 
01:31:32.870 --> 01:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
the field to help with that initial
 
01:31:35.270 --> 01:31:35.280 align:start position:0%
investigation is any complaint that
 
01:31:38.990 --> 01:31:39.000 align:start position:0%
comes through is not just a
 
01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:40.610 align:start position:0%
comes through is not just a
plain

01:31:40.610 --> 01:31:40.620 align:start position:0%
plain
 
01:31:45.530 --> 01:31:45.540 align:start position:0%
it's harassment it might be that I was
 
01:31:48.050 --> 01:31:48.060 align:start position:0%
in your case
 
01:31:51.410 --> 01:31:51.420 align:start position:0%
I was installing conduit two feet down
 
01:31:55.689 --> 01:31:55.699 align:start position:0%
three feet away from the deck
 
01:31:59.149 --> 01:31:59.159 align:start position:0%
oplc may not quite understand the full
 
01:31:59.159 --> 01:32:00.590 align:start position:0%
oplc may not quite understand the full
complaint

01:32:00.590 --> 01:32:00.600 align:start position:0%
complaint
 
01:32:02.330 --> 01:32:02.340 align:start position:0%
is that what you're saying that's
 
01:32:04.430 --> 01:32:04.440 align:start position:0%
correct without that expertise and those
 
01:32:06.050 --> 01:32:06.060 align:start position:0%
employees that are taking that
 
01:32:09.709 --> 01:32:09.719 align:start position:0%
information in don't have that yes
 
01:32:11.629 --> 01:32:11.639 align:start position:0%
yes representative Gerhart thank you
 
01:32:11.639 --> 01:32:13.310 align:start position:0%
yes representative Gerhart thank you
chairman

01:32:13.310 --> 01:32:13.320 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:32:15.470 --> 01:32:15.480 align:start position:0%
making the complaint info public you're
 
01:32:17.810 --> 01:32:17.820 align:start position:0%
against because it could be just
 
01:32:20.810 --> 01:32:20.820 align:start position:0%
arbitrary but with online reviews these
 
01:32:22.310 --> 01:32:22.320 align:start position:0%
days does that really matter I'm just
 
01:32:24.410 --> 01:32:24.420 align:start position:0%
one especially electricians that say are
 
01:32:25.729 --> 01:32:25.739 align:start position:0%
people just
 
01:32:27.410 --> 01:32:27.420 align:start position:0%
are people doing some background before
 
01:32:28.850 --> 01:32:28.860 align:start position:0%
they hire an electrician or the
 
01:32:30.110 --> 01:32:30.120 align:start position:0%
contractor that's hiring them in their
 
01:32:31.490 --> 01:32:31.500 align:start position:0%
subs that you they know who they're
 
01:32:32.990 --> 01:32:33.000 align:start position:0%
hiring would you say I'm just wondering
 
01:32:34.129 --> 01:32:34.139 align:start position:0%
if that's as much of a concern because
 
01:32:36.110 --> 01:32:36.120 align:start position:0%
like with the hospital situation having
 
01:32:38.209 --> 01:32:38.219 align:start position:0%
those complaints public somebody's going
 
01:32:40.669 --> 01:32:40.679 align:start position:0%
for surgery is going to do whoa so I'm
 
01:32:43.250 --> 01:32:43.260 align:start position:0%
just wondering if there's
 
01:32:45.169 --> 01:32:45.179 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I I think
 
01:32:47.750 --> 01:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
that it varies based on the profession
 
01:32:51.770 --> 01:32:51.780 align:start position:0%
or the because most electricians we're
 
01:32:54.169 --> 01:32:54.179 align:start position:0%
not online we're working the customer
 
01:32:57.410 --> 01:32:57.420 align:start position:0%
might go and look but honestly I don't
 
01:32:59.330 --> 01:32:59.340 align:start position:0%
think they you know you can put good
 
01:33:02.030 --> 01:33:02.040 align:start position:0%
reviews online we happen to know of an
 
01:33:03.709 --> 01:33:03.719 align:start position:0%
electrician that lost his license and he
 
01:33:05.390 --> 01:33:05.400 align:start position:0%
still you go online now he's advertising
 
01:33:06.470 --> 01:33:06.480 align:start position:0%
someone else he's got all these great
 
01:33:08.629 --> 01:33:08.639 align:start position:0%
reviews his license was revoked by the
 
01:33:10.370 --> 01:33:10.380 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire and he's still
 
01:33:13.189 --> 01:33:13.199 align:start position:0%
doing work so I don't know how much
 
01:33:15.169 --> 01:33:15.179 align:start position:0%
weight it plays into it some people do
 
01:33:17.689 --> 01:33:17.699 align:start position:0%
do the um diligent background and check
 
01:33:20.270 --> 01:33:20.280 align:start position:0%
but I don't think a lot do so I don't
 
01:33:21.770 --> 01:33:21.780 align:start position:0%
think the online part is going to show
 
01:33:21.780 --> 01:33:22.729 align:start position:0%
think the online part is going to show
that

01:33:22.729 --> 01:33:22.739 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:33:26.090 --> 01:33:26.100 align:start position:0%
you know my situation was put online or
 
01:33:27.229 --> 01:33:27.239 align:start position:0%
something because that I mean he may
 
01:33:29.270 --> 01:33:29.280 align:start position:0%
post something on there but
 
01:33:31.070 --> 01:33:31.080 align:start position:0%
I don't know how it would affect
 
01:33:33.110 --> 01:33:33.120 align:start position:0%
compared to having somebody involved to
 
01:33:34.850 --> 01:33:34.860 align:start position:0%
make sure that it wasn't a just a
 
01:33:38.750 --> 01:33:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:40.490 --> 01:33:40.500 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
01:33:43.310 --> 01:33:43.320 align:start position:0%
thank you so much thank you
 
01:33:54.530 --> 01:33:54.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:56.870 --> 01:33:56.880 align:start position:0%
thank you so much I am so happy to be
 
01:33:59.870 --> 01:33:59.880 align:start position:0%
here it is a privilege to be able to
 
01:34:02.629 --> 01:34:02.639 align:start position:0%
testify I'm Dr Deborah Warner I'm from
 
01:34:05.149 --> 01:34:05.159 align:start position:0%
Littleton New Hampshire I'm representing
 
01:34:07.490 --> 01:34:07.500 align:start position:0%
myself and my practice Bright Day
 
01:34:11.030 --> 01:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
psychology pllc
 
01:34:14.209 --> 01:34:14.219 align:start position:0%
I um have been in practice in for
 
01:34:18.709 --> 01:34:18.719 align:start position:0%
decades I have had occasions to work in
 
01:34:21.410 --> 01:34:21.420 align:start position:0%
private practice in a non-profit agency
 
01:34:24.790 --> 01:34:24.800 align:start position:0%
which I directed for more than 10 years
 
01:34:28.010 --> 01:34:28.020 align:start position:0%
in the state system I worked for the GOC
 
01:34:30.110 --> 01:34:30.120 align:start position:0%
and also youth
 
01:34:34.610 --> 01:34:34.620 align:start position:0%
I also worked for the VA I've had a lot
 
01:34:37.310 --> 01:34:37.320 align:start position:0%
of experience in different settings and
 
01:34:39.649 --> 01:34:39.659 align:start position:0%
I've supervised many psychologists and
 
01:34:41.870 --> 01:34:41.880 align:start position:0%
other mental health professionals along
 
01:34:44.270 --> 01:34:44.280 align:start position:0%
the way I'm very well informed about
 
01:34:47.450 --> 01:34:47.460 align:start position:0%
this legislation and also what led up to
 
01:34:51.950 --> 01:34:51.960 align:start position:0%
it this legislation is 18 days old it's
 
01:34:54.830 --> 01:34:54.840 align:start position:0%
just a little one come out of the
 
01:34:54.840 --> 01:34:57.169 align:start position:0%
just a little one come out of the
nursery

01:34:57.169 --> 01:34:57.179 align:start position:0%
nursery
 
01:34:59.870 --> 01:34:59.880 align:start position:0%
the I can say that the boys were not
 
01:35:02.930 --> 01:35:02.940 align:start position:0%
consulted they it was not under
 
01:35:05.870 --> 01:35:05.880 align:start position:0%
development in the study committee that
 
01:35:09.410 --> 01:35:09.420 align:start position:0%
happened last year in September I regret
 
01:35:11.330 --> 01:35:11.340 align:start position:0%
that I was not able to attend I had
 
01:35:13.189 --> 01:35:13.199 align:start position:0%
coveted at that time
 
01:35:15.649 --> 01:35:15.659 align:start position:0%
all better real good
 
01:35:17.990 --> 01:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
um and so it was
 
01:35:21.649 --> 01:35:21.659 align:start position:0%
um there were no board members or boards
 
01:35:23.810 --> 01:35:23.820 align:start position:0%
represented on that committee or
 
01:35:25.910 --> 01:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
testified on that there were no
 
01:35:27.890 --> 01:35:27.900 align:start position:0%
professionals there were no professional
 
01:35:31.070 --> 01:35:31.080 align:start position:0%
associations who testified in that study
 
01:35:33.410 --> 01:35:33.420 align:start position:0%
committee it was you know all the
 
01:35:35.870 --> 01:35:35.880 align:start position:0%
representatives and the senator and then
 
01:35:39.169 --> 01:35:39.179 align:start position:0%
representatives from oplc that's who
 
01:35:42.290 --> 01:35:42.300 align:start position:0%
came up with this and um and so it's
 
01:35:45.890 --> 01:35:45.900 align:start position:0%
kind of uh one-sided I guess I'd say in
 
01:35:47.270 --> 01:35:47.280 align:start position:0%
terms of whose perspective is
 
01:35:49.790 --> 01:35:49.800 align:start position:0%
represented here I want to bring up some
 
01:35:52.790 --> 01:35:52.800 align:start position:0%
points I am in full agreement with the
 
01:35:55.270 --> 01:35:55.280 align:start position:0%
points made by the board of psychology
 
01:35:58.490 --> 01:35:58.500 align:start position:0%
and I there are many more points as well
 
01:36:01.610 --> 01:36:01.620 align:start position:0%
I I'm going to go over them globally and
 
01:36:04.910 --> 01:36:04.920 align:start position:0%
correct some misunderstandings that seem
 
01:36:06.530 --> 01:36:06.540 align:start position:0%
to have come about
 
01:36:08.810 --> 01:36:08.820 align:start position:0%
um the
 
01:36:13.070 --> 01:36:13.080 align:start position:0%
the privacy of medical records is not
 
01:36:15.410 --> 01:36:15.420 align:start position:0%
really it was a
 
01:36:18.169 --> 01:36:18.179 align:start position:0%
two years in the making with
 
01:36:20.090 --> 01:36:20.100 align:start position:0%
representative Neil Kirk a dozen years
 
01:36:22.129 --> 01:36:22.139 align:start position:0%
ago I was involved in that process I
 
01:36:24.590 --> 01:36:24.600 align:start position:0%
don't that's how I got to meet this
 
01:36:27.590 --> 01:36:27.600 align:start position:0%
board originally and
 
01:36:31.669 --> 01:36:31.679 align:start position:0%
it's not about locks and Q you know keys
 
01:36:34.250 --> 01:36:34.260 align:start position:0%
and security or about any of the
 
01:36:37.430 --> 01:36:37.440 align:start position:0%
esteemed attorneys doing badly or
 
01:36:38.870 --> 01:36:38.880 align:start position:0%
anything with leaking documents or
 
01:36:41.450 --> 01:36:41.460 align:start position:0%
anything like that we have my port is a
 
01:36:43.970 --> 01:36:43.980 align:start position:0%
very good attorney I appreciate how
 
01:36:46.910 --> 01:36:46.920 align:start position:0%
disciplined he had at his work it's not
 
01:36:49.189 --> 01:36:49.199 align:start position:0%
about that the privacy of your medical
 
01:36:52.189 --> 01:36:52.199 align:start position:0%
records is that when you make a
 
01:36:55.550 --> 01:36:55.560 align:start position:0%
complaint to the state about your
 
01:36:57.830 --> 01:36:57.840 align:start position:0%
conditions of treatment whatever board
 
01:36:59.270 --> 01:36:59.280 align:start position:0%
it was on
 
01:37:02.030 --> 01:37:02.040 align:start position:0%
inside of that is the understanding and
 
01:37:05.649 --> 01:37:05.659 align:start position:0%
also in the statute for the psychologist
 
01:37:09.709 --> 01:37:09.719 align:start position:0%
it is exactly that when you do that you
 
01:37:12.169 --> 01:37:12.179 align:start position:0%
are waiving your own privilege of
 
01:37:15.290 --> 01:37:15.300 align:start position:0%
confidentiality on your own notes and
 
01:37:16.970 --> 01:37:16.980 align:start position:0%
that they can be shared with the state
 
01:37:19.910 --> 01:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
so that it can be evaluated
 
01:37:22.370 --> 01:37:22.380 align:start position:0%
and that's important that makes sense
 
01:37:26.450 --> 01:37:26.460 align:start position:0%
but if if you are subject of a third
 
01:37:29.810 --> 01:37:29.820 align:start position:0%
party investigation let's say your
 
01:37:33.169 --> 01:37:33.179 align:start position:0%
ex-spouse thinks that your psychologist
 
01:37:37.790 --> 01:37:37.800 align:start position:0%
did a bad job because they divorced you
 
01:37:42.050 --> 01:37:42.060 align:start position:0%
those records of your spouse or you
 
01:37:45.770 --> 01:37:45.780 align:start position:0%
are then absconded they're taken to the
 
01:37:45.780 --> 01:37:46.669 align:start position:0%
are then absconded they're taken to the
state

01:37:46.669 --> 01:37:46.679 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:37:46.679 --> 01:37:49.490 align:start position:0%
state
this

01:37:49.490 --> 01:37:49.500 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:37:51.709 --> 01:37:51.719 align:start position:0%
this point of this metal record this
 
01:37:53.510 --> 01:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
privacy is that they cannot be taken
 
01:37:55.250 --> 01:37:55.260 align:start position:0%
because they're a third party
 
01:37:56.810 --> 01:37:56.820 align:start position:0%
they cannot
 
01:37:59.689 --> 01:37:59.699 align:start position:0%
your records cannot be released without
 
01:38:02.990 --> 01:38:03.000 align:start position:0%
your knowledge and consent
 
01:38:04.910 --> 01:38:04.920 align:start position:0%
now the board in the process of an
 
01:38:07.250 --> 01:38:07.260 align:start position:0%
investigation might say well we think
 
01:38:09.649 --> 01:38:09.659 align:start position:0%
there's incompetence going on we need to
 
01:38:13.729 --> 01:38:13.739 align:start position:0%
see a pattern across patients hey Dr so
 
01:38:17.330 --> 01:38:17.340 align:start position:0%
and so give us 10 more patient records
 
01:38:19.790 --> 01:38:19.800 align:start position:0%
this statute that was brought about
 
01:38:22.790 --> 01:38:22.800 align:start position:0%
through a two-year process that involved
 
01:38:25.510 --> 01:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
a house concurrent resolution
 
01:38:28.250 --> 01:38:28.260 align:start position:0%
unanimously passed and bipartisan
 
01:38:30.830 --> 01:38:30.840 align:start position:0%
legislation from the House and Senate
 
01:38:33.950 --> 01:38:33.960 align:start position:0%
that was unanimously passed to protect
 
01:38:38.030 --> 01:38:38.040 align:start position:0%
your records from being taken in these
 
01:38:41.270 --> 01:38:41.280 align:start position:0%
third-party cases in
 
01:38:42.910 --> 01:38:42.920 align:start position:0%
the the
 
01:38:46.129 --> 01:38:46.139 align:start position:0%
expansion of an investigation that way
 
01:38:48.649 --> 01:38:48.659 align:start position:0%
your records don't go somewhere to the
 
01:38:50.390 --> 01:38:50.400 align:start position:0%
state without your knowledge or consent
 
01:38:52.430 --> 01:38:52.440 align:start position:0%
and they don't end up in archives and
 
01:38:54.050 --> 01:38:54.060 align:start position:0%
they don't end up looked at by people
 
01:38:56.990 --> 01:38:57.000 align:start position:0%
that you you never even conceived of
 
01:38:59.750 --> 01:38:59.760 align:start position:0%
I am a psychologist I take it seriously
 
01:39:02.169 --> 01:39:02.179 align:start position:0%
people come to me with very precious
 
01:39:05.689 --> 01:39:05.699 align:start position:0%
private issues it is an honor and a
 
01:39:09.229 --> 01:39:09.239 align:start position:0%
privilege to help them in that space I
 
01:39:12.229 --> 01:39:12.239 align:start position:0%
keep my mouth shut about that their
 
01:39:15.169 --> 01:39:15.179 align:start position:0%
records are very secure I only release
 
01:39:17.330 --> 01:39:17.340 align:start position:0%
them without their with their consent
 
01:39:19.669 --> 01:39:19.679 align:start position:0%
and knowledge
 
01:39:22.490 --> 01:39:22.500 align:start position:0%
and that's what is protected here it's
 
01:39:25.490 --> 01:39:25.500 align:start position:0%
not that once any records come to the
 
01:39:27.709 --> 01:39:27.719 align:start position:0%
state to for investigation that they
 
01:39:29.209 --> 01:39:29.219 align:start position:0%
could be leaked it has nothing to do
 
01:39:30.410 --> 01:39:30.420 align:start position:0%
with that
 
01:39:33.770 --> 01:39:33.780 align:start position:0%
it has to do with you knowing and many
 
01:39:35.689 --> 01:39:35.699 align:start position:0%
people here in the audience or even
 
01:39:37.729 --> 01:39:37.739 align:start position:0%
among the Reps
 
01:39:39.770 --> 01:39:39.780 align:start position:0%
might have gone to see a counselor I
 
01:39:42.169 --> 01:39:42.179 align:start position:0%
might have told them private things I
 
01:39:44.090 --> 01:39:44.100 align:start position:0%
don't think you would want those records
 
01:39:44.100 --> 01:39:45.350 align:start position:0%
don't think you would want those records
taken

01:39:45.350 --> 01:39:45.360 align:start position:0%
taken
 
01:39:47.750 --> 01:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
without your knowledge or concern that
 
01:39:49.669 --> 01:39:49.679 align:start position:0%
is the point of that it has nothing to
 
01:39:53.750 --> 01:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
do with 91a it has to do with your
 
01:39:55.490 --> 01:39:55.500 align:start position:0%
records going into the hands of the
 
01:39:55.500 --> 01:39:57.050 align:start position:0%
records going into the hands of the
state

01:39:57.050 --> 01:39:57.060 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:40:00.169 --> 01:40:00.179 align:start position:0%
I can say one of the things that
 
01:40:02.330 --> 01:40:02.340 align:start position:0%
we do need to get things
 
01:40:04.790 --> 01:40:04.800 align:start position:0%
that are operating and so on the
 
01:40:07.550 --> 01:40:07.560 align:start position:0%
psychology board uh became independent
 
01:40:09.290 --> 01:40:09.300 align:start position:0%
nine years ago
 
01:40:11.390 --> 01:40:11.400 align:start position:0%
and in that time they've had 13
 
01:40:11.400 --> 01:40:13.850 align:start position:0%
and in that time they've had 13
secretaries

01:40:13.850 --> 01:40:13.860 align:start position:0%
secretaries
 
01:40:15.590 --> 01:40:15.600 align:start position:0%
and you wonder why there might be some
 
01:40:17.330 --> 01:40:17.340 align:start position:0%
delays now and then they're
 
01:40:19.490 --> 01:40:19.500 align:start position:0%
restructuring oplc is a brand new place
 
01:40:21.470 --> 01:40:21.480 align:start position:0%
brand new Department they're
 
01:40:23.090 --> 01:40:23.100 align:start position:0%
restructuring all the time they're
 
01:40:26.510 --> 01:40:26.520 align:start position:0%
getting things more organized
 
01:40:29.290 --> 01:40:29.300 align:start position:0%
they're developing it's a growing
 
01:40:32.209 --> 01:40:32.219 align:start position:0%
evolving system which is fine they're
 
01:40:33.669 --> 01:40:33.679 align:start position:0%
doing things
 
01:40:36.470 --> 01:40:36.480 align:start position:0%
and we do need to do what we can but
 
01:40:38.689 --> 01:40:38.699 align:start position:0%
this is as they said not one size fits
 
01:40:41.209 --> 01:40:41.219 align:start position:0%
all and there does they're also I'm
 
01:40:42.709 --> 01:40:42.719 align:start position:0%
going to take my glasses off so I can
 
01:40:44.930 --> 01:40:44.940 align:start position:0%
see a little bit on here one of the
 
01:40:46.970 --> 01:40:46.980 align:start position:0%
problems with this is in my first page
 
01:40:48.950 --> 01:40:48.960 align:start position:0%
of my written testimony that you can see
 
01:40:51.410 --> 01:40:51.420 align:start position:0%
that looks like this has my name at the
 
01:40:53.209 --> 01:40:53.219 align:start position:0%
top Deborah Warner
 
01:40:55.510 --> 01:40:55.520 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:41:01.910 --> 01:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
the investigation needs to be defined it
 
01:41:03.890 --> 01:41:03.900 align:start position:0%
needs to happen when the as the way it's
 
01:41:06.310 --> 01:41:06.320 align:start position:0%
written now when the allegation comes in
 
01:41:08.870 --> 01:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
oplc just gets right to work in the
 
01:41:10.729 --> 01:41:10.739 align:start position:0%
enforcement department and starts
 
01:41:10.739 --> 01:41:13.250 align:start position:0%
enforcement department and starts
investigating

01:41:13.250 --> 01:41:13.260 align:start position:0%
investigating
 
01:41:15.649 --> 01:41:15.659 align:start position:0%
that's the way it's written
 
01:41:17.689 --> 01:41:17.699 align:start position:0%
that that's certainly There Are Rules
 
01:41:20.090 --> 01:41:20.100 align:start position:0%
otherwise that we'll probably fall off
 
01:41:22.610 --> 01:41:22.620 align:start position:0%
as their made congruent with what
 
01:41:25.070 --> 01:41:25.080 align:start position:0%
they've written in their statute
 
01:41:25.080 --> 01:41:26.870 align:start position:0%
they've written in their statute
but

01:41:26.870 --> 01:41:26.880 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:41:29.810 --> 01:41:29.820 align:start position:0%
you cannot have a
 
01:41:32.169 --> 01:41:32.179 align:start position:0%
an un
 
01:41:36.890 --> 01:41:36.900 align:start position:0%
defined investigation go on for a doctor
 
01:41:39.350 --> 01:41:39.360 align:start position:0%
or any of the trades
 
01:41:41.990 --> 01:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
that doesn't have charges in it
 
01:41:45.590 --> 01:41:45.600 align:start position:0%
the the license is not even notified of
 
01:41:47.689 --> 01:41:47.699 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in here that says they
 
01:41:49.669 --> 01:41:49.679 align:start position:0%
have to be notified currently in our
 
01:41:51.410 --> 01:41:51.420 align:start position:0%
statute the doctor gets notified
 
01:41:54.530 --> 01:41:54.540 align:start position:0%
immediately when an allegation comes in
 
01:41:57.410 --> 01:41:57.420 align:start position:0%
that's important and in fact they are
 
01:41:59.750 --> 01:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
given an opportunity voluntarily to
 
01:41:59.760 --> 01:42:01.850 align:start position:0%
given an opportunity voluntarily to
respond

01:42:01.850 --> 01:42:01.860 align:start position:0%
respond
 
01:42:03.770 --> 01:42:03.780 align:start position:0%
the board then looks at the allegation
 
01:42:05.990 --> 01:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
side by side with the response and they
 
01:42:09.350 --> 01:42:09.360 align:start position:0%
determine whether it violated the codes
 
01:42:12.770 --> 01:42:12.780 align:start position:0%
and laws and rules
 
01:42:15.890 --> 01:42:15.900 align:start position:0%
and whether or not it's trivial I mean
 
01:42:17.930 --> 01:42:17.940 align:start position:0%
it might be nothing might be you don't
 
01:42:19.910 --> 01:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
have enough Kleenex or something like
 
01:42:19.920 --> 01:42:21.229 align:start position:0%
have enough Kleenex or something like
that

01:42:21.229 --> 01:42:21.239 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:42:21.239 --> 01:42:22.189 align:start position:0%
that
um

01:42:22.189 --> 01:42:22.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:25.550 --> 01:42:25.560 align:start position:0%
they can dismiss it they can say oh this
 
01:42:28.490 --> 01:42:28.500 align:start position:0%
is an allegation we can say oh is this
 
01:42:30.530 --> 01:42:30.540 align:start position:0%
serious we're going to investigate they
 
01:42:33.410 --> 01:42:33.420 align:start position:0%
write an order of complaint and they
 
01:42:35.149 --> 01:42:35.159 align:start position:0%
convert it from an allegation to a
 
01:42:35.159 --> 01:42:36.410 align:start position:0%
convert it from an allegation to a
complaint

01:42:36.410 --> 01:42:36.420 align:start position:0%
complaint
 
01:42:40.250 --> 01:42:40.260 align:start position:0%
and then they can Define that order of
 
01:42:43.609 --> 01:42:43.619 align:start position:0%
complaint also to be an order of formal
 
01:42:45.950 --> 01:42:45.960 align:start position:0%
investigation where they lay out the
 
01:42:48.950 --> 01:42:48.960 align:start position:0%
charges to be investigated
 
01:42:51.050 --> 01:42:51.060 align:start position:0%
those become the guard rails they the
 
01:42:53.149 --> 01:42:53.159 align:start position:0%
scope of the investigation those are the
 
01:42:55.850 --> 01:42:55.860 align:start position:0%
guard rails for the investigation team
 
01:42:58.550 --> 01:42:58.560 align:start position:0%
then it goes over to enforcement and
 
01:43:01.250 --> 01:43:01.260 align:start position:0%
they get to do that work that's missing
 
01:43:01.260 --> 01:43:02.450 align:start position:0%
they get to do that work that's missing
here

01:43:02.450 --> 01:43:02.460 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:43:04.970 --> 01:43:04.980 align:start position:0%
Reach Out
 
01:43:07.669 --> 01:43:07.679 align:start position:0%
a person has a right a licensee has a
 
01:43:09.890 --> 01:43:09.900 align:start position:0%
right to know something has happened and
 
01:43:12.290 --> 01:43:12.300 align:start position:0%
that they've been complained about
 
01:43:15.050 --> 01:43:15.060 align:start position:0%
it's as Dr Phillips said earlier it's
 
01:43:17.510 --> 01:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
dangerous to not know if you're treating
 
01:43:20.930 --> 01:43:20.940 align:start position:0%
mental health issues if somebody has uh
 
01:43:23.390 --> 01:43:23.400 align:start position:0%
you know broken down and they're they're
 
01:43:26.870 --> 01:43:26.880 align:start position:0%
making strange or even frivolous
 
01:43:28.689 --> 01:43:28.699 align:start position:0%
um or or
 
01:43:32.330 --> 01:43:32.340 align:start position:0%
unrealistic complaints about them the
 
01:43:32.340 --> 01:43:34.010 align:start position:0%
unrealistic complaints about them the
psychologist

01:43:34.010 --> 01:43:34.020 align:start position:0%
psychologist
 
01:43:36.050 --> 01:43:36.060 align:start position:0%
if the department says well this is just
 
01:43:37.370 --> 01:43:37.380 align:start position:0%
crazy we're going to dismiss it and
 
01:43:38.270 --> 01:43:38.280 align:start position:0%
we're not even going to tell the
 
01:43:39.709 --> 01:43:39.719 align:start position:0%
psychologist that's psychologist it
 
01:43:41.330 --> 01:43:41.340 align:start position:0%
doesn't know that their patient is
 
01:43:43.250 --> 01:43:43.260 align:start position:0%
breaking down
 
01:43:46.129 --> 01:43:46.139 align:start position:0%
that's unsafe for that patient it's
 
01:43:47.810 --> 01:43:47.820 align:start position:0%
unsafe for the psychologist they need to
 
01:43:49.970 --> 01:43:49.980 align:start position:0%
know immediately they're not going to be
 
01:43:52.129 --> 01:43:52.139 align:start position:0%
mean they just need to know it's
 
01:43:52.139 --> 01:43:54.890 align:start position:0%
mean they just need to know it's
important

01:43:54.890 --> 01:43:54.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:56.510 --> 01:43:56.520 align:start position:0%
there are some other things about that
 
01:43:58.310 --> 01:43:58.320 align:start position:0%
bifurcated process between the
 
01:44:01.490 --> 01:44:01.500 align:start position:0%
allegation and the complaint once it's a
 
01:44:04.669 --> 01:44:04.679 align:start position:0%
complaint it is certainly reportable by
 
01:44:06.169 --> 01:44:06.179 align:start position:0%
the doctor
 
01:44:08.930 --> 01:44:08.940 align:start position:0%
to everybody that who asks that they
 
01:44:10.370 --> 01:44:10.380 align:start position:0%
have a professional relationship with
 
01:44:13.189 --> 01:44:13.199 align:start position:0%
among hospital privileges I've got
 
01:44:16.490 --> 01:44:16.500 align:start position:0%
insurance panels I have my own practice
 
01:44:19.550 --> 01:44:19.560 align:start position:0%
insurance there's medical societies and
 
01:44:22.010 --> 01:44:22.020 align:start position:0%
such that all say do you have have you
 
01:44:24.050 --> 01:44:24.060 align:start position:0%
ever had a complaint
 
01:44:26.750 --> 01:44:26.760 align:start position:0%
but our statute
 
01:44:30.290 --> 01:44:30.300 align:start position:0%
says if you have an allegation that's
 
01:44:32.390 --> 01:44:32.400 align:start position:0%
not reportable and in fact insurance
 
01:44:34.729 --> 01:44:34.739 align:start position:0%
companies and professional organizations
 
01:44:37.010 --> 01:44:37.020 align:start position:0%
and institutions are prohibited from
 
01:44:39.709 --> 01:44:39.719 align:start position:0%
asking about an allegation
 
01:44:41.149 --> 01:44:41.159 align:start position:0%
that's going to be wiped out that's
 
01:44:43.490 --> 01:44:43.500 align:start position:0%
going to be repealed
 
01:44:46.550 --> 01:44:46.560 align:start position:0%
so there are things I understand that um
 
01:44:50.390 --> 01:44:50.400 align:start position:0%
the reply from director Courtney was
 
01:44:53.750 --> 01:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
that this is all 90 91a stuff and don't
 
01:44:55.189 --> 01:44:55.199 align:start position:0%
worry everything's secure that has
 
01:44:57.530 --> 01:44:57.540 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with it I walk out of
 
01:44:59.270 --> 01:44:59.280 align:start position:0%
something and if I have a complaint or
 
01:45:01.189 --> 01:45:01.199 align:start position:0%
an allegation I'm in a different status
 
01:45:04.430 --> 01:45:04.440 align:start position:0%
for my whole profession and in fact if I
 
01:45:07.129 --> 01:45:07.139 align:start position:0%
tell them that I've had an allegation if
 
01:45:08.390 --> 01:45:08.400 align:start position:0%
I have to
 
01:45:10.970 --> 01:45:10.980 align:start position:0%
because it's not protected by law if I
 
01:45:13.129 --> 01:45:13.139 align:start position:0%
then have to tell them then I'm going to
 
01:45:15.290 --> 01:45:15.300 align:start position:0%
be kicked off of insurance panels and
 
01:45:17.270 --> 01:45:17.280 align:start position:0%
you know whole Realms of patients won't
 
01:45:19.189 --> 01:45:19.199 align:start position:0%
be able to have reimbursement seeing me
 
01:45:20.990 --> 01:45:21.000 align:start position:0%
I might still be licensed but I won't be
 
01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:22.370 align:start position:0%
I might still be licensed but I won't be
reimbursable

01:45:22.370 --> 01:45:22.380 align:start position:0%
reimbursable
 
01:45:25.310 --> 01:45:25.320 align:start position:0%
I might have an upgrade in my in
 
01:45:27.890 --> 01:45:27.900 align:start position:0%
practice insurance I might not get
 
01:45:27.900 --> 01:45:29.330 align:start position:0%
practice insurance I might not get
insurance

01:45:29.330 --> 01:45:29.340 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
01:45:31.669 --> 01:45:31.679 align:start position:0%
things like this will happen kicked off
 
01:45:34.189 --> 01:45:34.199 align:start position:0%
of my hospital privileges all of these
 
01:45:35.689 --> 01:45:35.699 align:start position:0%
things can happen because of that and
 
01:45:39.410 --> 01:45:39.420 align:start position:0%
this is a protection in the law
 
01:45:39.420 --> 01:45:46.270 align:start position:0%
this is a protection in the law
currently

01:45:46.270 --> 01:45:46.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:56.830 --> 01:45:56.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:00.050 --> 01:46:00.060 align:start position:0%
I can stop here
 
01:46:03.169 --> 01:46:03.179 align:start position:0%
I will be here Friday there are so many
 
01:46:06.770 --> 01:46:06.780 align:start position:0%
pieces of this I strongly urge the
 
01:46:10.669 --> 01:46:10.679 align:start position:0%
committee to retain this bill it could
 
01:46:12.229 --> 01:46:12.239 align:start position:0%
be good
 
01:46:14.870 --> 01:46:14.880 align:start position:0%
I have had experience doing things like
 
01:46:18.169 --> 01:46:18.179 align:start position:0%
this I will apply myself to this process
 
01:46:20.870 --> 01:46:20.880 align:start position:0%
if you retain it you'll see a lot of me
 
01:46:23.030 --> 01:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
in those subcommittees and I'm a good
 
01:46:26.870 --> 01:46:26.880 align:start position:0%
worker as people know from my past so
 
01:46:26.880 --> 01:46:27.950 align:start position:0%
worker as people know from my past so
um

01:46:27.950 --> 01:46:27.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:30.350 --> 01:46:30.360 align:start position:0%
have I clarified this thing about
 
01:46:32.510 --> 01:46:32.520 align:start position:0%
patient privacy
 
01:46:35.629 --> 01:46:35.639 align:start position:0%
that it's not a 91a issue
 
01:46:37.370 --> 01:46:37.380 align:start position:0%
it's it's about
 
01:46:40.790 --> 01:46:40.800 align:start position:0%
your medical records and where they go
 
01:46:42.770 --> 01:46:42.780 align:start position:0%
and I've
 
01:46:46.310 --> 01:46:46.320 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you for a testimony
 
01:46:49.310 --> 01:46:49.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:51.709 --> 01:46:51.719 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
01:46:54.770 --> 01:46:54.780 align:start position:0%
uh yes representative gold
 
01:46:56.689 --> 01:46:56.699 align:start position:0%
thank you Dr Warner and thank you for
 
01:46:58.729 --> 01:46:58.739 align:start position:0%
coming down thank you representative
 
01:47:01.729 --> 01:47:01.739 align:start position:0%
having worked with um child welfare
 
01:47:04.910 --> 01:47:04.920 align:start position:0%
abuse and neglect allegations and the
 
01:47:06.830 --> 01:47:06.840 align:start position:0%
intake process for that and trying to
 
01:47:08.810 --> 01:47:08.820 align:start position:0%
consolidate that for the 13 different
 
01:47:13.129 --> 01:47:13.139 align:start position:0%
districts around the state I am
 
01:47:16.310 --> 01:47:16.320 align:start position:0%
I cannot imagine trying to do an intake
 
01:47:19.450 --> 01:47:19.460 align:start position:0%
process a screening process for
 
01:47:22.910 --> 01:47:22.920 align:start position:0%
complaints against so many different
 
01:47:22.920 --> 01:47:23.570 align:start position:0%
complaints against so many different
um

01:47:23.570 --> 01:47:23.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:26.209 --> 01:47:26.219 align:start position:0%
disciplines and and be able to ferret
 
01:47:28.070 --> 01:47:28.080 align:start position:0%
those out through a central office can
 
01:47:30.410 --> 01:47:30.420 align:start position:0%
you talk about how you can Envision that
 
01:47:33.490 --> 01:47:33.500 align:start position:0%
kind of a process happening in this case
 
01:47:35.649 --> 01:47:35.659 align:start position:0%
well I think
 
01:47:38.330 --> 01:47:38.340 align:start position:0%
badly yes
 
01:47:40.729 --> 01:47:40.739 align:start position:0%
um I think that if if you know you have
 
01:47:43.370 --> 01:47:43.380 align:start position:0%
a small Department of attorneys and they
 
01:47:46.250 --> 01:47:46.260 align:start position:0%
have on occasion they draw in some of
 
01:47:49.550 --> 01:47:49.560 align:start position:0%
the practitioners and they can call them
 
01:47:52.010 --> 01:47:52.020 align:start position:0%
um and then they look that over
 
01:47:54.530 --> 01:47:54.540 align:start position:0%
could be good but there's nothing in
 
01:47:56.330 --> 01:47:56.340 align:start position:0%
this that says that they need to have a
 
01:47:59.270 --> 01:47:59.280 align:start position:0%
professional of that practice involved
 
01:48:02.629 --> 01:48:02.639 align:start position:0%
in any part of that investigation the
 
01:48:05.209 --> 01:48:05.219 align:start position:0%
board would not know about an allegation
 
01:48:08.990 --> 01:48:09.000 align:start position:0%
or a complaint until it's done with the
 
01:48:11.330 --> 01:48:11.340 align:start position:0%
investigative process and then it comes
 
01:48:12.729 --> 01:48:12.739 align:start position:0%
at them in a report
 
01:48:15.410 --> 01:48:15.420 align:start position:0%
one other thing that does remind me as
 
01:48:17.470 --> 01:48:17.480 align:start position:0%
well thank you for jogging my memory
 
01:48:20.149 --> 01:48:20.159 align:start position:0%
once the board sees a report of
 
01:48:24.410 --> 01:48:24.420 align:start position:0%
Investigation they then have uh the duty
 
01:48:26.570 --> 01:48:26.580 align:start position:0%
to determine whether or not to take it
 
01:48:29.510 --> 01:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
further and to do discipline
 
01:48:32.209 --> 01:48:32.219 align:start position:0%
and they might recommend that there be a
 
01:48:34.669 --> 01:48:34.679 align:start position:0%
settlement offered which is pretty
 
01:48:37.729 --> 01:48:37.739 align:start position:0%
frequent from what I gather
 
01:48:41.450 --> 01:48:41.460 align:start position:0%
at that point the licensee doesn't
 
01:48:43.490 --> 01:48:43.500 align:start position:0%
hasn't seen anything
 
01:48:47.330 --> 01:48:47.340 align:start position:0%
all they get is in this in this bill all
 
01:48:49.370 --> 01:48:49.380 align:start position:0%
they would get is
 
01:48:51.109 --> 01:48:51.119 align:start position:0%
an offer
 
01:48:54.169 --> 01:48:54.179 align:start position:0%
with 20 pages long of well here you're
 
01:48:55.550 --> 01:48:55.560 align:start position:0%
going to have restricted practice or
 
01:48:57.229 --> 01:48:57.239 align:start position:0%
you'll be suspended for a year or you
 
01:48:58.870 --> 01:48:58.880 align:start position:0%
have to do corrective supervision
 
01:49:01.870 --> 01:49:01.880 align:start position:0%
whatever it might be and they've never
 
01:49:05.450 --> 01:49:05.460 align:start position:0%
seen the allegation they've never seen
 
01:49:09.530 --> 01:49:09.540 align:start position:0%
the evidence against them currently in
 
01:49:12.890 --> 01:49:12.900 align:start position:0%
our statute before they were asked to
 
01:49:15.770 --> 01:49:15.780 align:start position:0%
get into settlement negotiations they
 
01:49:17.870 --> 01:49:17.880 align:start position:0%
would be given discovery
 
01:49:20.390 --> 01:49:20.400 align:start position:0%
now a lot of us watch enough TV shows we
 
01:49:22.490 --> 01:49:22.500 align:start position:0%
know what Discovery is and that's the
 
01:49:25.550 --> 01:49:25.560 align:start position:0%
the other side gets to show what they've
 
01:49:28.370 --> 01:49:28.380 align:start position:0%
collected that's relevant to the case
 
01:49:32.330 --> 01:49:32.340 align:start position:0%
and it's in our statute right now that
 
01:49:34.870 --> 01:49:34.880 align:start position:0%
when you as a doctor are being
 
01:49:37.669 --> 01:49:37.679 align:start position:0%
approached for a negotiation you get to
 
01:49:39.290 --> 01:49:39.300 align:start position:0%
see an accumulation of the evidence
 
01:49:42.169 --> 01:49:42.179 align:start position:0%
that's been assembled against you
 
01:49:44.270 --> 01:49:44.280 align:start position:0%
you don't get through legal analysis you
 
01:49:46.550 --> 01:49:46.560 align:start position:0%
just get that and you get today and so
 
01:49:48.530 --> 01:49:48.540 align:start position:0%
you can look at it and you can say well
 
01:49:50.450 --> 01:49:50.460 align:start position:0%
it was so-and-so telling the truth well
 
01:49:51.950 --> 01:49:51.960 align:start position:0%
I guess yeah they're saying it that way
 
01:49:54.050 --> 01:49:54.060 align:start position:0%
and the board's taking it that way I I
 
01:49:56.629 --> 01:49:56.639 align:start position:0%
guess I'll consider settling I'll talk
 
01:49:58.430 --> 01:49:58.440 align:start position:0%
about it but if they look and say oh my
 
01:50:00.169 --> 01:50:00.179 align:start position:0%
goodness this never happened
 
01:50:02.030 --> 01:50:02.040 align:start position:0%
oh my goodness I wasn't even treating
 
01:50:03.590 --> 01:50:03.600 align:start position:0%
them at that point or you know things
 
01:50:06.229 --> 01:50:06.239 align:start position:0%
like that absolutely I'm gonna go to
 
01:50:09.350 --> 01:50:09.360 align:start position:0%
hearing I'm gonna do that currently
 
01:50:09.360 --> 01:50:11.629 align:start position:0%
hearing I'm gonna do that currently
actually

01:50:11.629 --> 01:50:11.639 align:start position:0%
actually
 
01:50:13.669 --> 01:50:13.679 align:start position:0%
currently they get that report if they
 
01:50:15.950 --> 01:50:15.960 align:start position:0%
didn't get the report after they might
 
01:50:18.290 --> 01:50:18.300 align:start position:0%
choose to go to hearing then they would
 
01:50:20.870 --> 01:50:20.880 align:start position:0%
get the regular kind of Discovery but
 
01:50:22.669 --> 01:50:22.679 align:start position:0%
it's at that point where you're signing
 
01:50:24.649 --> 01:50:24.659 align:start position:0%
away your occupation
 
01:50:27.470 --> 01:50:27.480 align:start position:0%
that you you need that information it's
 
01:50:29.930 --> 01:50:29.940 align:start position:0%
reasonable to do and in fact it's in the
 
01:50:33.169 --> 01:50:33.179 align:start position:0%
law now I just
 
01:50:35.629 --> 01:50:35.639 align:start position:0%
may I just say something yes I think
 
01:50:37.790 --> 01:50:37.800 align:start position:0%
that this is also something that we can
 
01:50:39.470 --> 01:50:39.480 align:start position:0%
talk about at the subcommittee hearing
 
01:50:42.050 --> 01:50:42.060 align:start position:0%
I'm just you know concerned about the
 
01:50:44.689 --> 01:50:44.699 align:start position:0%
time and I'm thinking that maybe this is
 
01:50:45.950 --> 01:50:45.960 align:start position:0%
something we can talk about at the
 
01:50:48.250 --> 01:50:48.260 align:start position:0%
subcommittee hearing on Friday okay I'll
 
01:50:50.990 --> 01:50:51.000 align:start position:0%
say a closing comment then
 
01:50:52.490 --> 01:50:52.500 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:50:52.500 --> 01:50:53.149 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

01:50:53.149 --> 01:50:53.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:58.270 --> 01:50:58.280 align:start position:0%
when you are taking away rights and and
 
01:51:01.490 --> 01:51:01.500 align:start position:0%
protections that are already in statute
 
01:51:05.149 --> 01:51:05.159 align:start position:0%
you really need to justify why they're
 
01:51:06.830 --> 01:51:06.840 align:start position:0%
taking that away
 
01:51:08.750 --> 01:51:08.760 align:start position:0%
I think that's been misunderstood by
 
01:51:12.950 --> 01:51:12.960 align:start position:0%
oplc unfortunately in their rebuttal but
 
01:51:16.070 --> 01:51:16.080 align:start position:0%
that's I think if the onus is on them to
 
01:51:18.410 --> 01:51:18.420 align:start position:0%
let us know why they could take that
 
01:51:18.420 --> 01:51:19.550 align:start position:0%
let us know why they could take that
away

01:51:19.550 --> 01:51:19.560 align:start position:0%
away
 
01:51:21.530 --> 01:51:21.540 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for your testimony
 
01:51:23.330 --> 01:51:23.340 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:51:24.890 --> 01:51:24.900 align:start position:0%
um that was the last pink card I had did
 
01:51:40.669 --> 01:51:40.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:40.679 --> 01:51:49.870 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:51:49.870 --> 01:51:49.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:51.830 --> 01:51:51.840 align:start position:0%
would you mind turning your microphone
 
01:51:51.840 --> 01:51:53.090 align:start position:0%
would you mind turning your microphone
on

01:51:53.090 --> 01:51:53.100 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:51:54.709 --> 01:51:54.719 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:51:58.010 --> 01:51:58.020 align:start position:0%
can you hear me okay yes thanks
 
01:51:59.750 --> 01:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
uh good morning shangulay with the
 
01:52:01.250 --> 01:52:01.260 align:start position:0%
office of professional licensure and
 
01:52:03.770 --> 01:52:03.780 align:start position:0%

03:05:10.849 --> 03:05:10.859 align:start position:0%
I got one that that we were placing

03:05:16.010 --> 03:05:18.650 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

all right well
 
03:05:22.670 --> 03:05:22.680 align:start position:0%
if you say so I'll assume it's
 
03:05:26.510 --> 03:05:26.520 align:start position:0%
legitimate but please send it to me
 
03:05:32.990 --> 03:05:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:37.670 --> 03:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
our the plan for today is to
 
03:05:39.650 --> 03:05:39.660 align:start position:0%
vote on
 
03:05:42.290 --> 03:05:42.300 align:start position:0%
our early bills
 
03:05:45.889 --> 03:05:45.899 align:start position:0%
and the first section of bills listed in
 
03:05:49.010 --> 03:05:49.020 align:start position:0%
the notice are the early bills
 
03:05:49.020 --> 03:05:50.750 align:start position:0%
the notice are the early bills
um

03:05:50.750 --> 03:05:50.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:05:54.290 --> 03:05:54.300 align:start position:0%
the second group is bills that we have
 
03:05:58.130 --> 03:05:58.140 align:start position:0%
heard but are not early but I'd like to
 
03:05:58.140 --> 03:05:59.630 align:start position:0%
heard but are not early but I'd like to
to

03:05:59.630 --> 03:05:59.640 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:06:01.910 --> 03:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
get as many of them out of the committee
 
03:06:04.070 --> 03:06:04.080 align:start position:0%
as possible but we're going to start
 
03:06:07.309 --> 03:06:07.319 align:start position:0%
with the early bills
 
03:06:07.319 --> 03:06:13.849 align:start position:0%
with the early bills
and

03:06:13.849 --> 03:06:13.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:16.910 --> 03:06:16.920 align:start position:0%
let's see using ones first or hard ones
 
03:06:16.920 --> 03:06:17.990 align:start position:0%
let's see using ones first or hard ones
first

03:06:17.990 --> 03:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
first
 
03:06:19.429 --> 03:06:19.439 align:start position:0%
easy one
 
03:06:23.830 --> 03:06:23.840 align:start position:0%
okay so let's start with House Bill 337
 
03:06:26.630 --> 03:06:26.640 align:start position:0%
which is about notice of public meetings
 
03:06:29.690 --> 03:06:29.700 align:start position:0%
and an opportunity to comment I believe
 
03:06:33.469 --> 03:06:33.479 align:start position:0%
that went to the licensing subcommittee
 
03:06:55.670 --> 03:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:58.490 --> 03:06:58.500 align:start position:0%
yes Matt and Cherry uh you should not
 
03:06:58.500 --> 03:07:00.170 align:start position:0%
yes Matt and Cherry uh you should not
have

03:07:00.170 --> 03:07:00.180 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:07:05.330 --> 03:07:05.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:08.630 --> 03:07:08.640 align:start position:0%
ah amendment number zero one eight zero
 
03:07:12.170 --> 03:07:12.180 align:start position:0%
is that the one correct okay we have I
 
03:07:13.429 --> 03:07:13.439 align:start position:0%
have that one
 
03:07:16.849 --> 03:07:16.859 align:start position:0%
and I will first move that Amendment
 
03:07:20.570 --> 03:07:20.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:20.580 --> 03:07:22.670 align:start position:0%
 
sorry

03:07:22.670 --> 03:07:22.680 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
03:07:24.410 --> 03:07:24.420 align:start position:0%
okay so you're moving on to pass with
 
03:07:28.389 --> 03:07:28.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:31.969 --> 03:07:31.979 align:start position:0%
okay so that is by schuette seconded by
 
03:07:34.849 --> 03:07:34.859 align:start position:0%
leckis the committee heard during the
 
03:07:38.809 --> 03:07:38.819 align:start position:0%
hearing that the sponsor learned that
 
03:07:42.429 --> 03:07:42.439 align:start position:0%
the there was an incorrect RSA site
 
03:07:46.250 --> 03:07:46.260 align:start position:0%
listed which unfortunately precipitated
 
03:07:49.130 --> 03:07:49.140 align:start position:0%
the FM that's attached to the bill which
 
03:07:52.670 --> 03:07:52.680 align:start position:0%
does not really apply once that RSA site
 
03:07:56.450 --> 03:07:56.460 align:start position:0%
was corrected the amendment corrects
 
03:08:01.330 --> 03:08:01.340 align:start position:0%
that RSA site to what you now see
 
03:08:06.650 --> 03:08:06.660 align:start position:0%
310-a colon 1 hyphen d as in David
 
03:08:09.670 --> 03:08:09.680 align:start position:0%
and then some of the language
 
03:08:12.790 --> 03:08:12.800 align:start position:0%
in the actual first section of the bill
 
03:08:16.389 --> 03:08:16.399 align:start position:0%
had concerns for oplc
 
03:08:20.870 --> 03:08:20.880 align:start position:0%
that their confidentiality Clauses were
 
03:08:23.750 --> 03:08:23.760 align:start position:0%
not properly protected
 
03:08:28.490 --> 03:08:28.500 align:start position:0%
so oplc and the sponsor worked on the
 
03:08:31.429 --> 03:08:31.439 align:start position:0%
language that you see in this amendment
 
03:08:34.490 --> 03:08:34.500 align:start position:0%
and they're both happy with it the
 
03:08:37.309 --> 03:08:37.319 align:start position:0%
sponsor feels that it allows the
 
03:08:40.610 --> 03:08:40.620 align:start position:0%
transparency that he was seeking and the
 
03:08:43.929 --> 03:08:43.939 align:start position:0%
better notice for public meetings
 
03:08:47.630 --> 03:08:47.640 align:start position:0%
and oplc feels that the confidentiality
 
03:08:52.250 --> 03:08:52.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:54.650 --> 03:08:54.660 align:start position:0%
excellent representative thank you I
 
03:08:56.269 --> 03:08:56.279 align:start position:0%
agree with all that I'll just expand a
 
03:08:58.190 --> 03:08:58.200 align:start position:0%
little on the fiscal note issue I know
 
03:08:59.630 --> 03:08:59.640 align:start position:0%
there was some people are concerned with
 
03:09:01.910 --> 03:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
that what happened was they put it in
 
03:09:03.830 --> 03:09:03.840 align:start position:0%
the section having to do with hearings
 
03:09:06.650 --> 03:09:06.660 align:start position:0%
and disciplinary stuff which meant that
 
03:09:08.269 --> 03:09:08.279 align:start position:0%
everything they were going to release
 
03:09:10.070 --> 03:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
had to be reviewed by a lawyer which
 
03:09:11.510 --> 03:09:11.520 align:start position:0%
meant they would have had to hire a
 
03:09:13.849 --> 03:09:13.859 align:start position:0%
number of new lawyers and that was just
 
03:09:17.389 --> 03:09:17.399 align:start position:0%
an error and this corrects that the
 
03:09:19.849 --> 03:09:19.859 align:start position:0%
other concern o'plc had was in cases
 
03:09:19.859 --> 03:09:20.750 align:start position:0%
other concern o'plc had was in cases
where

03:09:20.750 --> 03:09:20.760 align:start position:0%
where
 
03:09:23.389 --> 03:09:23.399 align:start position:0%
something had to be dealt with in sort
 
03:09:25.610 --> 03:09:25.620 align:start position:0%
of a not emergency but a short-term
 
03:09:27.530 --> 03:09:27.540 align:start position:0%
basis and there's some allowance for
 
03:09:30.170 --> 03:09:30.180 align:start position:0%
that here but I think it's a good
 
03:09:34.150 --> 03:09:34.160 align:start position:0%
Amendment and and suggests we support it
 
03:09:36.950 --> 03:09:36.960 align:start position:0%
does anyone else wish to comment on
 
03:09:38.450 --> 03:09:38.460 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
03:09:45.950 --> 03:09:45.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:48.110 --> 03:09:48.120 align:start position:0%
replaces the entire build
 
03:09:50.570 --> 03:09:50.580 align:start position:0%
so if we adopt the amendment the rest
 
03:09:53.990 --> 03:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
that's all there is anyone else
 
03:09:54.000 --> 03:09:55.490 align:start position:0%
that's all there is anyone else
good

03:09:55.490 --> 03:09:55.500 align:start position:0%
good
 
03:09:56.750 --> 03:09:56.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:09:59.269 --> 03:09:59.279 align:start position:0%
all right in that case the motion is to
 
03:10:01.210 --> 03:10:01.220 align:start position:0%

yes seeing none will put it on consent
 
03:12:19.010 --> 03:12:19.020 align:start position:0%
it is a fiscal note is it so we don't
 
03:12:21.830 --> 03:12:21.840 align:start position:0%
the amendment calculates the expense and
 
03:12:24.469 --> 03:12:24.479 align:start position:0%
I'm sure the committee report will make
 
03:12:28.370 --> 03:12:28.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:31.190 --> 03:12:31.200 align:start position:0%
okay speaking of that committee reports
 
03:12:34.610 --> 03:12:34.620 align:start position:0%

03:12:37.190 --> 03:12:37.200 align:start position:0%
can get in the calendar for next week
 
03:12:39.769 --> 03:12:39.779 align:start position:0%

03:12:42.349 --> 03:12:42.359 align:start position:0%

03:12:46.370 --> 03:12:46.380 align:start position:0%

I like to see somebody prepared so yes
 
03:12:56.210 --> 03:12:56.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:56.220 --> 03:12:57.889 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:12:57.889 --> 03:12:57.899 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:12:57.899 --> 03:13:01.130 align:start position:0%
okay
um

03:13:01.130 --> 03:13:01.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:03.170 --> 03:13:03.180 align:start position:0%
let's do something
 
03:13:06.650 --> 03:13:06.660 align:start position:0%
uh represent on House Bill 449
 
03:13:08.450 --> 03:13:08.460 align:start position:0%
representative Goldie I believe you have
 
03:13:10.429 --> 03:13:10.439 align:start position:0%
a motion
 
03:13:13.190 --> 03:13:13.200 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh I moved to
 
03:13:22.370 --> 03:13:22.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:22.380 --> 03:13:25.610 align:start position:0%
 
sure

03:13:25.610 --> 03:13:25.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:25.620 --> 03:13:27.110 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:13:27.110 --> 03:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:13:29.690 --> 03:13:29.700 align:start position:0%
we have another bill that'll be coming
 
03:13:31.730 --> 03:13:31.740 align:start position:0%
before this committee dealing with uh
 
03:13:35.170 --> 03:13:35.180 align:start position:0%
this issue and that being Hospital
 
03:13:38.030 --> 03:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
436 that has an amendment that
 
03:13:40.610 --> 03:13:40.620 align:start position:0%
subcommittee will be hearing I think
 
03:13:40.620 --> 03:13:41.750 align:start position:0%
subcommittee will be hearing I think
that

03:13:41.750 --> 03:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:13:44.330 --> 03:13:44.340 align:start position:0%
takes care of the issue we're looking at
 
03:13:47.150 --> 03:13:47.160 align:start position:0%
so therefore until that bill goes
 
03:13:48.769 --> 03:13:48.779 align:start position:0%
forward and is taken care of that I
 
03:13:50.510 --> 03:13:50.520 align:start position:0%
think to retain it is the appropriate
 
03:13:51.650 --> 03:13:51.660 align:start position:0%
thing to do
 
03:13:53.510 --> 03:13:53.520 align:start position:0%
yes thank you we'll
 
03:13:55.610 --> 03:13:55.620 align:start position:0%
it'll be good to have something in case
 
03:13:57.950 --> 03:13:57.960 align:start position:0%
the Senate makes major changes to our
 
03:14:00.230 --> 03:14:00.240 align:start position:0%

03:14:05.690 --> 03:14:05.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:08.150 --> 03:14:08.160 align:start position:0%

amendment that representative Pearson
 
03:15:32.950 --> 03:15:32.960 align:start position:0%
has put a lot of work into it completely
 
03:15:35.750 --> 03:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
overhauls 436 as it stands and we need
 
03:15:37.490 --> 03:15:37.500 align:start position:0%
an extra day of committee subcommittee
 
03:15:39.530 --> 03:15:39.540 align:start position:0%
work to to look at that we'll bring it
 
03:15:41.510 --> 03:15:41.520 align:start position:0%
back to you next week
 
03:15:50.690 --> 03:15:50.700 align:start position:0%

03:15:58.010 --> 03:15:58.020 align:start position:0%
okay see what their availability is we
 
03:16:00.590 --> 03:16:00.600 align:start position:0%
need that's it's an important bill and
 
03:16:04.790 --> 03:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
we need to get to work on it so we will
 
03:16:09.650 --> 03:16:09.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:11.990 --> 03:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
either Friday yeah my only concern with
 
03:16:13.610 --> 03:16:13.620 align:start position:0%
Friday is I know people wanted some time
 
03:16:15.650 --> 03:16:15.660 align:start position:0%
to look at it and it's a fairly
 
03:16:15.660 --> 03:16:17.269 align:start position:0%
to look at it and it's a fairly
substantial

03:16:17.269 --> 03:16:17.279 align:start position:0%
substantial
 
03:16:19.370 --> 03:16:19.380 align:start position:0%
um Amendment
 
03:16:22.250 --> 03:16:22.260 align:start position:0%
well we'll we'll decide by the end of

the day today when we will do that
 
03:16:28.550 --> 03:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
uh it will be no later than next
 
03:16:30.710 --> 03:16:30.720 align:start position:0%
Wednesday because that is absolutely
 
03:16:38.570 --> 03:16:38.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:42.349 --> 03:16:42.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:44.210 --> 03:16:44.220 align:start position:0%
we know whether representative Pearson
 
03:16:49.990 --> 03:16:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:52.429 --> 03:16:52.439 align:start position:0%
would you care to share that with US
 
03:16:52.439 --> 03:16:56.809 align:start position:0%
would you care to share that with US
Representative

03:16:56.809 --> 03:16:56.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:58.550 --> 03:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
Friday morning or Wednesday morning of
 
03:17:02.750 --> 03:17:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:05.150 --> 03:17:05.160 align:start position:0%
um no when the subcommittee can meet
 
03:17:08.570 --> 03:17:08.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:11.269 --> 03:17:11.279 align:start position:0%
Wednesday unfortunately we do have a
 
03:17:14.090 --> 03:17:14.100 align:start position:0%
fairly low we do have scheduled public
 
03:17:16.490 --> 03:17:16.500 align:start position:0%
hearings so you would want to have it
 
03:17:19.510 --> 03:17:19.520 align:start position:0%
ready to exec on Wednesday
 
03:17:22.250 --> 03:17:22.260 align:start position:0%
is it possible for the subcommittee to
 
03:17:24.950 --> 03:17:24.960 align:start position:0%
meet after this exact session since the
 
03:17:28.610 --> 03:17:28.620 align:start position:0%
subcommittee can meet after this they
 
03:17:30.530 --> 03:17:30.540 align:start position:0%
24-hour notice
 
03:17:32.750 --> 03:17:32.760 align:start position:0%
does a continuance of a work session
 
03:17:35.690 --> 03:17:35.700 align:start position:0%
require notice since it was 24 hours
 
03:17:38.210 --> 03:17:38.220 align:start position:0%
yeah it does right
 
03:17:40.490 --> 03:17:40.500 align:start position:0%
this is not a work session
 
03:17:43.010 --> 03:17:43.020 align:start position:0%
I'm sure you can find a room on Monday
 
03:17:47.690 --> 03:17:47.700 align:start position:0%
or Tuesday if you need to but and like I
 
03:17:50.269 --> 03:17:50.279 align:start position:0%
said Friday morning is available
 
03:17:52.610 --> 03:17:52.620 align:start position:0%
I know for sure that the rooms are
 
03:17:54.290 --> 03:17:54.300 align:start position:0%
available because no other committee is
 
03:17:57.110 --> 03:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
meeting on Friday okay so you can have a
 
03:18:01.910 --> 03:18:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:01.920 --> 03:18:04.690 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:18:04.690 --> 03:18:04.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:07.550 --> 03:18:07.560 align:start position:0%
all right then
 
03:18:11.990 --> 03:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
I'll spill 250. representative Simon
 
03:18:13.790 --> 03:18:13.800 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I
 
03:18:17.389 --> 03:18:17.399 align:start position:0%
um we'll move itl on HB 250.
 
03:18:22.790 --> 03:18:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:25.910 --> 03:18:25.920 align:start position:0%
Fitzpatrick okay
 
03:18:27.769 --> 03:18:27.779 align:start position:0%
uh do you wish to speak to your motion
 
03:18:27.779 --> 03:18:29.690 align:start position:0%
uh do you wish to speak to your motion
yes

03:18:29.690 --> 03:18:29.700 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:18:31.490 --> 03:18:31.500 align:start position:0%
um my apologies to the committee this
 
03:18:32.870 --> 03:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
actually came out of the subcommittee
 
03:18:36.050 --> 03:18:36.060 align:start position:0%
all to pass 3-2 I was the deciding vote
 
03:18:38.870 --> 03:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
on that since that time I've gained a
 
03:18:40.250 --> 03:18:40.260 align:start position:0%
better understanding of the bill I
 
03:18:42.250 --> 03:18:42.260 align:start position:0%
missed the original public hearing
 
03:18:45.230 --> 03:18:45.240 align:start position:0%
my understanding right now is that if an
 
03:18:47.929 --> 03:18:47.939 align:start position:0%
officer or is anybody in group two dies
 
03:18:47.939 --> 03:18:48.710 align:start position:0%
officer or is anybody in group two dies
um

03:18:48.710 --> 03:18:48.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:18:52.130 --> 03:18:52.140 align:start position:0%
they receive 50 of a year salary a
 
03:18:53.330 --> 03:18:53.340 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars out of the
 
03:18:55.070 --> 03:18:55.080 align:start position:0%
general fund and they're still still
 
03:18:58.550 --> 03:18:58.560 align:start position:0%
have their regular uh retirement package
 
03:19:01.610 --> 03:19:01.620 align:start position:0%
accessible as it always would
 
03:19:03.469 --> 03:19:03.479 align:start position:0%
um obviously we can't put a monetary
 
03:19:05.870 --> 03:19:05.880 align:start position:0%
value on somebody giving their life and
 
03:19:07.910 --> 03:19:07.920 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't even pretend to try to do
 
03:19:10.250 --> 03:19:10.260 align:start position:0%
that our gratitude goes out to those
 
03:19:11.929 --> 03:19:11.939 align:start position:0%
those people
 
03:19:13.969 --> 03:19:13.979 align:start position:0%
um but we do have to make decisions
 
03:19:16.250 --> 03:19:16.260 align:start position:0%
practical decisions as well and I feel
 
03:19:18.290 --> 03:19:18.300 align:start position:0%
like that's uh
 
03:19:20.030 --> 03:19:20.040 align:start position:0%
we are honoring them with the package
 
03:19:22.370 --> 03:19:22.380 align:start position:0%
that we're that we're offering
 
03:19:22.380 --> 03:19:24.290 align:start position:0%
that we're that we're offering

get paid if they die
 
03:20:08.269 --> 03:20:08.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:10.969 --> 03:20:10.979 align:start position:0%
it's representative goalie
 
03:20:12.830 --> 03:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and I too will be
 
03:20:14.650 --> 03:20:14.660 align:start position:0%
voting against us I think we heard
 
03:20:19.250 --> 03:20:19.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:22.330 --> 03:20:22.340 align:start position:0%
if someone retires and chooses the
 
03:20:25.070 --> 03:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
benefit that allows their surviving
 
03:20:27.170 --> 03:20:27.180 align:start position:0%
spouse to get a hundred percent
 
03:20:29.330 --> 03:20:29.340 align:start position:0%
that option is available
 
03:20:32.450 --> 03:20:32.460 align:start position:0%
so once that person is passes away and
 
03:20:34.250 --> 03:20:34.260 align:start position:0%
dies that the spouse continues to
 
03:20:36.790 --> 03:20:36.800 align:start position:0%
receive a hundred percent this goes
 
03:20:39.349 --> 03:20:39.359 align:start position:0%
backwards and says that
 
03:20:42.769 --> 03:20:42.779 align:start position:0%
if someone is killed in the line of duty
 
03:20:45.170 --> 03:20:45.180 align:start position:0%
the spouse only receives 50 of that
 
03:20:49.670 --> 03:20:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:52.070 --> 03:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
so I think it was a matter of fairness
 
03:20:53.809 --> 03:20:53.819 align:start position:0%
that we heard
 
03:20:56.690 --> 03:20:56.700 align:start position:0%
and it codifies a statute that allows
 
03:20:57.769 --> 03:20:57.779 align:start position:0%
100 percent
 
03:21:02.630 --> 03:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
going forward upon the accidental death
 
03:21:05.870 --> 03:21:05.880 align:start position:0%
while in duty of service so I cannot
 
03:21:10.429 --> 03:21:10.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:13.490 --> 03:21:13.500 align:start position:0%
representative blackis and then O'Brien
 
03:21:15.590 --> 03:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
um yeah I had some initial confusion
 
03:21:17.410 --> 03:21:17.420 align:start position:0%
about that my understanding and if it's
 
03:21:20.210 --> 03:21:20.220 align:start position:0%
incorrect and the chair wants to ask Mr
 
03:21:22.130 --> 03:21:22.140 align:start position:0%
Carland to make it clear we can do that
 
03:21:24.469 --> 03:21:24.479 align:start position:0%
but I believe that those are two
 
03:21:25.969 --> 03:21:25.979 align:start position:0%
completely different things that this
 
03:21:27.950 --> 03:21:27.960 align:start position:0%
bill is
 
03:21:31.190 --> 03:21:31.200 align:start position:0%
raising the one-year amount they get
 
03:21:34.610 --> 03:21:34.620 align:start position:0%
if they die from 50 to 100 with the on
 
03:21:36.710 --> 03:21:36.720 align:start position:0%
top of the hundred thousand that's there
 
03:21:36.720 --> 03:21:38.030 align:start position:0%
top of the hundred thousand that's there
but

03:21:38.030 --> 03:21:38.040 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:21:39.590 --> 03:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
um if they're retired they can get a
 
03:21:41.929 --> 03:21:41.939 align:start position:0%
hundred percent but that
 
03:21:44.210 --> 03:21:44.220 align:start position:0%
um that's a selection by the person who
 
03:21:46.250 --> 03:21:46.260 align:start position:0%
retired and they're paying for that by
 
03:21:49.550 --> 03:21:49.560 align:start position:0%
accepting lower uh pension payments at
 
03:21:51.490 --> 03:21:51.500 align:start position:0%
least that's my understanding so
 
03:21:54.469 --> 03:21:54.479 align:start position:0%
I initially had similar thoughts as to
 
03:21:56.630 --> 03:21:56.640 align:start position:0%
what represent goalie said but I don't
 
03:21:59.269 --> 03:21:59.279 align:start position:0%
think that's how it works it we're
 
03:22:02.809 --> 03:22:02.819 align:start position:0%
talking about 50 or 100 percent of two
 
03:22:04.550 --> 03:22:04.560 align:start position:0%
different numbers
 
03:22:08.710 --> 03:22:08.720 align:start position:0%
this would raise the
 
03:22:12.370 --> 03:22:12.380 align:start position:0%
total value of the
 
03:22:15.469 --> 03:22:15.479 align:start position:0%
this would make the amount that this
 
03:22:17.450 --> 03:22:17.460 align:start position:0%
Widow would receive
 
03:22:21.590 --> 03:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
to be up from 50 to 100 percent of their
 
03:22:24.889 --> 03:22:24.899 align:start position:0%
annual rate of earnable compensation
 
03:22:27.769 --> 03:22:27.779 align:start position:0%
which is not the same as the amount of
 
03:22:32.870 --> 03:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:34.730 --> 03:22:34.740 align:start position:0%
that's what it says a hundred percent of
 
03:22:39.349 --> 03:22:39.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:41.450 --> 03:22:41.460 align:start position:0%
is that not correct representative bully
 
03:22:43.849 --> 03:22:43.859 align:start position:0%
it's the state annuity so it's the full
 
03:22:45.290 --> 03:22:45.300 align:start position:0%
term of the
 
03:22:45.300 --> 03:22:46.309 align:start position:0%
term of the
payment

03:22:46.309 --> 03:22:46.319 align:start position:0%
payment
 
03:22:48.830 --> 03:22:48.840 align:start position:0%
going out right so it's 100 going
 
03:22:50.870 --> 03:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
forward right same thing that if a
 
03:22:53.450 --> 03:22:53.460 align:start position:0%
member chose the 100 option upon
 
03:22:55.190 --> 03:22:55.200 align:start position:0%
retirement at their death that their
 
03:23:01.490 --> 03:23:01.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:06.050 --> 03:23:06.060 align:start position:0%
100 option which many do the amount they
 
03:23:08.750 --> 03:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
get is not the same as their annual
 
03:23:10.849 --> 03:23:10.859 align:start position:0%
compensation it's the amount of their
 
03:23:13.969 --> 03:23:13.979 align:start position:0%
pension lowered to to make it for two
 
03:23:20.050 --> 03:23:20.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:24.530 --> 03:23:24.540 align:start position:0%
Mr Carlin if you could uh help us with
 
03:23:28.849 --> 03:23:28.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:31.849 --> 03:23:31.859 align:start position:0%
I'm getting confused and I'm sure I'm
 
03:23:35.870 --> 03:23:35.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:37.309 --> 03:23:37.319 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair for the record
 
03:23:38.870 --> 03:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
Marty garland from New Hampshire
 
03:23:41.450 --> 03:23:41.460 align:start position:0%
retirement system so the question is
 
03:23:43.610 --> 03:23:43.620 align:start position:0%
what what the current accidental death
 
03:23:46.490 --> 03:23:46.500 align:start position:0%
benefit for a group two member who who
 
03:23:49.070 --> 03:23:49.080 align:start position:0%
is uh killed uh in a job related
 
03:23:53.469 --> 03:23:53.479 align:start position:0%
incident the surviving spouse would get
 
03:23:57.889 --> 03:23:57.899 align:start position:0%
50 percent for life of the members you
 
03:23:59.330 --> 03:23:59.340 align:start position:0%
know last year of earnable compensation
 
03:24:01.969 --> 03:24:01.979 align:start position:0%
so whatever their current rate of uh
 
03:24:04.550 --> 03:24:04.560 align:start position:0%
earnings were 50 of that as a lifetime
 
03:24:08.030 --> 03:24:08.040 align:start position:0%
benefit plus a refund of the members
 
03:24:10.370 --> 03:24:10.380 align:start position:0%
accumulated contributions towards the re
 
03:24:11.690 --> 03:24:11.700 align:start position:0%
you know towards their own retirement
 
03:24:12.950 --> 03:24:12.960 align:start position:0%
you know the money that they were
 
03:24:15.290 --> 03:24:15.300 align:start position:0%
putting in over the years before the
 
03:24:17.630 --> 03:24:17.640 align:start position:0%
incident so that this bill would
 
03:24:20.510 --> 03:24:20.520 align:start position:0%
increase that to 100 of the you know the
 
03:24:23.510 --> 03:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
last year's earnable compensation and
 
03:24:25.610 --> 03:24:25.620 align:start position:0%
the lump sum piece stays in there is a
 
03:24:27.889 --> 03:24:27.899 align:start position:0%
payout the hundred thousand dollar death
 
03:24:30.110 --> 03:24:30.120 align:start position:0%
benefits your reference is a separate uh
 
03:24:31.910 --> 03:24:31.920 align:start position:0%
appropriation outside the retirement
 
03:24:34.190 --> 03:24:34.200 align:start position:0%
system that's a general fund
 
03:24:37.370 --> 03:24:37.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:37.380 --> 03:24:39.290 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:24:39.290 --> 03:24:39.300 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:24:43.790 --> 03:24:43.800 align:start position:0%
but at retirement if the member were to
 
03:24:45.889 --> 03:24:45.899 align:start position:0%
select the 100 option just for
 
03:24:48.769 --> 03:24:48.779 align:start position:0%
simplicity's sake the amount that he got
 
03:24:51.410 --> 03:24:51.420 align:start position:0%
would not be necessarily equal to his
 
03:24:51.420 --> 03:24:52.790 align:start position:0%
would not be necessarily equal to his
last

03:24:52.790 --> 03:24:52.800 align:start position:0%
last
 
03:24:54.950 --> 03:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
Year's earnable compensation is that
 
03:24:57.769 --> 03:24:57.779 align:start position:0%
correct correct I mean it you know if
 
03:24:59.630 --> 03:24:59.640 align:start position:0%
the you know the last year was in the
 
03:25:01.550 --> 03:25:01.560 align:start position:0%
high three or the high five it would be
 
03:25:03.469 --> 03:25:03.479 align:start position:0%
you know a friend you know a portion of
 
03:25:06.650 --> 03:25:06.660 align:start position:0%
that but uh you know when a benefit is
 
03:25:08.450 --> 03:25:08.460 align:start position:0%
um calculated is What's called the
 
03:25:10.370 --> 03:25:10.380 align:start position:0%
maximum option which is the benefit is
 
03:25:12.410 --> 03:25:12.420 align:start position:0%
paid to the retiree for their lifetime
 
03:25:14.510 --> 03:25:14.520 align:start position:0%
and and as as discussed there's
 
03:25:16.490 --> 03:25:16.500 align:start position:0%
something called the survivorship option
 
03:25:19.490 --> 03:25:19.500 align:start position:0%
where the member can make a choice at
 
03:25:22.429 --> 03:25:22.439 align:start position:0%
retirement to leave some or all of their
 
03:25:26.510 --> 03:25:26.520 align:start position:0%
pension to uh one or more individuals
 
03:25:27.950 --> 03:25:27.960 align:start position:0%
um you know there's some statutory
 
03:25:30.170 --> 03:25:30.180 align:start position:0%
limitations on who can give that to and
 
03:25:31.670 --> 03:25:31.680 align:start position:0%
and if you're leaving a survivorship
 
03:25:35.150 --> 03:25:35.160 align:start position:0%
option uh there is a reduction in the
 
03:25:37.670 --> 03:25:37.680 align:start position:0%
monthly benefit from the outset
 
03:25:39.710 --> 03:25:39.720 align:start position:0%
um related to the so basically based on
 
03:25:41.210 --> 03:25:41.220 align:start position:0%
the age of the member and the age of the
 
03:25:43.610 --> 03:25:43.620 align:start position:0%
beneficiary uh you know it's sort of a
 
03:25:47.030 --> 03:25:47.040 align:start position:0%
life expectancy calculation
 
03:25:47.040 --> 03:25:48.710 align:start position:0%
life expectancy calculation
okay

03:25:48.710 --> 03:25:48.720 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:25:52.790 --> 03:25:52.800 align:start position:0%
so that the fact that this benefit is
 
03:25:55.370 --> 03:25:55.380 align:start position:0%
100 of or fifty percent of earnable
 
03:25:58.130 --> 03:25:58.140 align:start position:0%
compensation is not necessarily related
 
03:26:00.550 --> 03:26:00.560 align:start position:0%
to what the pension would be even at 100
 
03:26:03.950 --> 03:26:03.960 align:start position:0%
Survivor benefit correct it is there's a
 
03:26:05.809 --> 03:26:05.819 align:start position:0%
little bit of a variation in the statute
 
03:26:07.729 --> 03:26:07.739 align:start position:0%
the group one accidental death benefit
 
03:26:09.710 --> 03:26:09.720 align:start position:0%
is 50 of their average final
 
03:26:11.750 --> 03:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
compensation the group two is fifty
 
03:26:14.690 --> 03:26:14.700 align:start position:0%
percent of their you know um current you
 
03:26:16.490 --> 03:26:16.500 align:start position:0%
know annual rate of compensation that
 
03:26:17.630 --> 03:26:17.640 align:start position:0%
you know I'm
 
03:26:20.570 --> 03:26:20.580 align:start position:0%
not sure how much more different that is
 
03:26:22.490 --> 03:26:22.500 align:start position:0%
for some people but you know it is set
 
03:26:23.750 --> 03:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
up differently in the statute already
 
03:26:26.150 --> 03:26:26.160 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure what the history on that is
 
03:26:29.809 --> 03:26:29.819 align:start position:0%
okay so that the maximum pension would
 
03:26:32.090 --> 03:26:32.100 align:start position:0%
be 50 of
 
03:26:35.630 --> 03:26:35.640 align:start position:0%
earnable compensation for
 
03:26:38.330 --> 03:26:38.340 align:start position:0%
last three years or whatever and that
 
03:26:40.969 --> 03:26:40.979 align:start position:0%
would be reduced to allow for it to
 
03:26:43.070 --> 03:26:43.080 align:start position:0%
continue Over The spouse's life as well
 
03:26:45.229 --> 03:26:45.239 align:start position:0%
as or the beneficiary's life as well as
 
03:26:47.330 --> 03:26:47.340 align:start position:0%
the with the service retirement yeah yes
 
03:26:49.670 --> 03:26:49.680 align:start position:0%
yeah okay there's no age-based
 
03:26:51.650 --> 03:26:51.660 align:start position:0%
reductions or anything in the the death
 
03:26:54.830 --> 03:26:54.840 align:start position:0%
benefit okay thank you representative uh
 
03:26:56.710 --> 03:26:56.720 align:start position:0%
O'Brien you had a question
 
03:27:00.349 --> 03:27:00.359 align:start position:0%
thank you madam ships
 
03:27:03.410 --> 03:27:03.420 align:start position:0%
um by going judging by your questions uh
 
03:27:05.269 --> 03:27:05.279 align:start position:0%
first I'm not going to support this
 
03:27:07.729 --> 03:27:07.739 align:start position:0%
obviously but I do agree with
 
03:27:09.849 --> 03:27:09.859 align:start position:0%
representative Cooley and what he said
 
03:27:12.889 --> 03:27:12.899 align:start position:0%
but it seems to be the focus in the
 
03:27:16.250 --> 03:27:16.260 align:start position:0%
questions is at the end of the career
 
03:27:18.530 --> 03:27:18.540 align:start position:0%
I'm more concerned at the beginning of
 
03:27:21.469 --> 03:27:21.479 align:start position:0%
the career we were all young men all
 
03:27:24.710 --> 03:27:24.720 align:start position:0%
young ladies once and we know our
 
03:27:26.990 --> 03:27:27.000 align:start position:0%
financial obligations at that particular
 
03:27:29.870 --> 03:27:29.880 align:start position:0%
time we were in a very critical moment
 
03:27:32.990 --> 03:27:33.000 align:start position:0%
we went out and purchased houses cars
 
03:27:35.150 --> 03:27:35.160 align:start position:0%
different things and we're blessed with
 
03:27:37.729 --> 03:27:37.739 align:start position:0%
children along the way and had those
 
03:27:41.090 --> 03:27:41.100 align:start position:0%
other expenses that came up but most of
 
03:27:43.849 --> 03:27:43.859 align:start position:0%
the contractual stipulations and
 
03:27:46.190 --> 03:27:46.200 align:start position:0%
departments you work in a tiered
 
03:27:49.610 --> 03:27:49.620 align:start position:0%
environment for every single year you
 
03:27:52.070 --> 03:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
come on at probably probation every rate
 
03:27:54.290 --> 03:27:54.300 align:start position:0%
of pay like I say and then you work
 
03:27:58.250 --> 03:27:58.260 align:start position:0%
yourself up to basically TOP Step so if
 
03:28:00.710 --> 03:28:00.720 align:start position:0%
you had it were a firefighter on
 
03:28:00.720 --> 03:28:02.330 align:start position:0%
you had it were a firefighter on
probation

03:28:02.330 --> 03:28:02.340 align:start position:0%
probation
 
03:28:05.389 --> 03:28:05.399 align:start position:0%
married with children and were killed in
 
03:28:07.550 --> 03:28:07.560 align:start position:0%
the line of duty you're talking to Mia
 
03:28:07.560 --> 03:28:08.809 align:start position:0%
the line of duty you're talking to Mia
pittance

03:28:08.809 --> 03:28:08.819 align:start position:0%
pittance
 
03:28:11.450 --> 03:28:11.460 align:start position:0%
but this and that's going to put that
 
03:28:14.690 --> 03:28:14.700 align:start position:0%
family into a financial strain and this
 
03:28:17.349 --> 03:28:17.359 align:start position:0%
is the reason why this bill came forward
 
03:28:22.130 --> 03:28:22.140 align:start position:0%
it is it's talking about fortunately a
 
03:28:24.410 --> 03:28:24.420 align:start position:0%
very rare event
 
03:28:27.769 --> 03:28:27.779 align:start position:0%
that occurs okay it's not like we lose a
 
03:28:30.229 --> 03:28:30.239 align:start position:0%
firefighter a mouth or a police officer
 
03:28:32.570 --> 03:28:32.580 align:start position:0%
a month if you did who wouldn't want to
 
03:28:35.150 --> 03:28:35.160 align:start position:0%
work those jobs you know it's very
 
03:28:38.389 --> 03:28:38.399 align:start position:0%
difficult so in the rare cases as it
 
03:28:41.330 --> 03:28:41.340 align:start position:0%
does happen it protects at all
 
03:28:43.610 --> 03:28:43.620 align:start position:0%
yes it will protect the guy that's at
 
03:28:46.610 --> 03:28:46.620 align:start position:0%
the high end closer to retirement but
 
03:28:49.370 --> 03:28:49.380 align:start position:0%
don't forget about the young guy
 
03:28:52.130 --> 03:28:52.140 align:start position:0%
that is trying to start the family he's
 
03:28:53.690 --> 03:28:53.700 align:start position:0%
at the weakest
 
03:28:56.630 --> 03:28:56.640 align:start position:0%
financially at that particular time and
 
03:28:58.910 --> 03:28:58.920 align:start position:0%
needs our protection so I am not going
 
03:29:00.469 --> 03:29:00.479 align:start position:0%
to support this Bill thank you Matt
 
03:29:02.630 --> 03:29:02.640 align:start position:0%
Madam chair and may I have a question of
 
03:29:04.550 --> 03:29:04.560 align:start position:0%
the chair please it seems with
 
03:29:06.650 --> 03:29:06.660 align:start position:0%
additional information do you think we
 
03:29:08.630 --> 03:29:08.640 align:start position:0%
would want more time to digest Mr
 
03:29:11.150 --> 03:29:11.160 align:start position:0%
Collins remarks or do you want to have
 
03:29:14.450 --> 03:29:14.460 align:start position:0%
the vote stand well I'm because there's
 
03:29:15.530 --> 03:29:15.540 align:start position:0%
a couple of people that have already
 
03:29:17.870 --> 03:29:17.880 align:start position:0%
wanted signed up to speak so we'll let
 
03:29:20.690 --> 03:29:20.700 align:start position:0%
them talk okay thank you madam chances
 
03:29:22.090 --> 03:29:22.100 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
03:29:24.170 --> 03:29:24.180 align:start position:0%
pause on this we can do that
 
03:29:27.530 --> 03:29:27.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:29.330 --> 03:29:29.340 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
03:29:33.110 --> 03:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
it would it would be my sentiment to
 
03:29:35.090 --> 03:29:35.100 align:start position:0%
have a little bit more time on this
 
03:29:37.969 --> 03:29:37.979 align:start position:0%
based on the confusion among the
 
03:29:41.269 --> 03:29:41.279 align:start position:0%
committee and my own confusion thank you
 
03:29:43.070 --> 03:29:43.080 align:start position:0%
all right thank you representative
 
03:29:43.080 --> 03:29:44.269 align:start position:0%
all right thank you representative
shuitt

03:29:44.269 --> 03:29:44.279 align:start position:0%
shuitt
 
03:29:47.030 --> 03:29:47.040 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I don't know if he
 
03:29:49.490 --> 03:29:49.500 align:start position:0%
knows the answer to this but I'm curious
 
03:29:53.530 --> 03:29:53.540 align:start position:0%
if Mr Carlin could give us an idea of
 
03:29:56.870 --> 03:29:56.880 align:start position:0%
approximately how often this kind of
 
03:29:59.389 --> 03:29:59.399 align:start position:0%
thing happens on the job
 
03:30:02.929 --> 03:30:02.939 align:start position:0%
um I I can if I went back to my chair
 
03:30:04.729 --> 03:30:04.739 align:start position:0%
and looked on my phone I could I could
 
03:30:07.070 --> 03:30:07.080 align:start position:0%
find out exactly in a couple of minutes
 
03:30:10.370 --> 03:30:10.380 align:start position:0%
I I off and I will do that after I leave
 
03:30:12.650 --> 03:30:12.660 align:start position:0%
this this seat and wave my hands if I'm
 
03:30:14.330 --> 03:30:14.340 align:start position:0%
wrong but I believe there's currently
 
03:30:16.429 --> 03:30:16.439 align:start position:0%
about somewhere in the vicinity of 20
 
03:30:19.670 --> 03:30:19.680 align:start position:0%
group 2 job related death benefits being
 
03:30:22.610 --> 03:30:22.620 align:start position:0%
currently paid to to survivors at this
 
03:30:25.010 --> 03:30:25.020 align:start position:0%
point I think it's you know 19 or 20 or
 
03:30:27.110 --> 03:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
something like that but if I'm way off
 
03:30:29.030 --> 03:30:29.040 align:start position:0%
I'll wave my arms but I'm pretty pretty
 
03:30:31.250 --> 03:30:31.260 align:start position:0%
sure that's what we're what the current
 
03:30:33.349 --> 03:30:33.359 align:start position:0%
landscape is this would not be
 
03:30:35.570 --> 03:30:35.580 align:start position:0%
retroactive though those those people
 
03:30:39.530 --> 03:30:39.540 align:start position:0%
what I'm what I'm my question was is if
 
03:30:42.889 --> 03:30:42.899 align:start position:0%
you have a a sense and I know it's not
 
03:30:47.510 --> 03:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
totally accurate how often we lose one
 
03:30:50.750 --> 03:30:50.760 align:start position:0%
of these people on the job okay I I
 
03:30:52.610 --> 03:30:52.620 align:start position:0%
don't have a strong sense I mean
 
03:30:54.590 --> 03:30:54.600 align:start position:0%
typically when something a tragedy like
 
03:30:56.030 --> 03:30:56.040 align:start position:0%
that happens you know it does get news
 
03:30:58.790 --> 03:30:58.800 align:start position:0%
coverage and I can certainly recall you
 
03:31:01.010 --> 03:31:01.020 align:start position:0%
know you know more than more than a
 
03:31:02.630 --> 03:31:02.640 align:start position:0%
couple in recent years but I don't have
 
03:31:04.250 --> 03:31:04.260 align:start position:0%
a count maybe
 
03:31:05.870 --> 03:31:05.880 align:start position:0%
um you know somebody else with one of
 
03:31:09.110 --> 03:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
the employer a member organizations has
 
03:31:11.750 --> 03:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
has a better idea of the incidence of
 
03:31:15.769 --> 03:31:15.779 align:start position:0%
this but um you know it it happens sadly
 
03:31:19.490 --> 03:31:19.500 align:start position:0%
but rarely yes representative a bear
 
03:31:21.370 --> 03:31:21.380 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
03:31:24.849 --> 03:31:24.859 align:start position:0%
may I suggest on all future
 
03:31:28.849 --> 03:31:28.859 align:start position:0%
retirement bills that there be a graph
 
03:31:30.710 --> 03:31:30.720 align:start position:0%
that's not
 
03:31:33.650 --> 03:31:33.660 align:start position:0%
like the graphs that we get perhaps you
 
03:31:35.570 --> 03:31:35.580 align:start position:0%
should talk to the retirement system Mr
 
03:31:37.849 --> 03:31:37.859 align:start position:0%
Carlin is the person involved thank you
 
03:31:40.550 --> 03:31:40.560 align:start position:0%
may I talk directly to Marty yes Marty
 
03:31:46.190 --> 03:31:46.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:48.710 --> 03:31:48.720 align:start position:0%
yes I can express your frustration with
 
03:31:50.809 --> 03:31:50.819 align:start position:0%
some of the data information we get it's
 
03:31:53.750 --> 03:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
not always the best Mr Widow I'd like to
 
03:31:55.790 --> 03:31:55.800 align:start position:0%
say this is not a public hearing we are
 
03:31:58.130 --> 03:31:58.140 align:start position:0%
not taking testimony from the committee
 
03:32:00.830 --> 03:32:00.840 align:start position:0%
from from the public it is purely a
 
03:32:03.110 --> 03:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
discussion in the committee to vote on
 
03:32:04.190 --> 03:32:04.200 align:start position:0%
the bills
 
03:32:06.710 --> 03:32:06.720 align:start position:0%
we might ask as in this case someone
 
03:32:09.229 --> 03:32:09.239 align:start position:0%
that has special knowledge but we are
 
03:32:12.349 --> 03:32:12.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:14.990 --> 03:32:15.000 align:start position:0%
the public hearing was a while ago on
 
03:32:17.330 --> 03:32:17.340 align:start position:0%
House Bill 180.
 
03:32:18.590 --> 03:32:18.600 align:start position:0%
all right
 
03:32:20.330 --> 03:32:20.340 align:start position:0%
um any other questions representative
 
03:32:23.330 --> 03:32:23.340 align:start position:0%
Simon thank you madam chair I'm in a bit
 
03:32:25.429 --> 03:32:25.439 align:start position:0%
of a awkward quandary at the moment
 
03:32:29.750 --> 03:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
because after Mr Carlin's testimony it
 
03:32:32.990 --> 03:32:33.000 align:start position:0%
this is closer to what I thought it was
 
03:32:35.110 --> 03:32:35.120 align:start position:0%
initially than what I was led to believe
 
03:32:39.110 --> 03:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
secondarily so I don't really support my
 
03:32:40.910 --> 03:32:40.920 align:start position:0%
own motion
 
03:32:40.920 --> 03:32:41.690 align:start position:0%
own motion
um

03:32:41.690 --> 03:32:41.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:32:43.550 --> 03:32:43.560 align:start position:0%
well that's a very awkward situation
 
03:32:45.110 --> 03:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
it's an awkward situation for me to be
 
03:32:47.210 --> 03:32:47.220 align:start position:0%
in and just offer acceptance if I'm
 
03:32:48.710 --> 03:32:48.720 align:start position:0%
allowed to withdraw my motion I would
 
03:32:53.330 --> 03:32:53.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:55.610 --> 03:32:55.620 align:start position:0%
minutes and go on to the next bill
 
03:32:58.670 --> 03:32:58.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:01.670 --> 03:33:01.680 align:start position:0%
offer accepted
 
03:33:05.990 --> 03:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
offer accepted okay thank you
 
03:33:13.030 --> 03:33:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:17.990 --> 03:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
okay so house bill 371.
 
03:33:19.969 --> 03:33:19.979 align:start position:0%
well let's finish the retirement house
 
03:33:23.330 --> 03:33:23.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:25.429 --> 03:33:25.439 align:start position:0%
Simon that do you have a motion on that
 
03:33:27.889 --> 03:33:27.899 align:start position:0%
yes I move in expedient to legislate
 
03:33:27.899 --> 03:33:29.269 align:start position:0%
yes I move in expedient to legislate
manager

03:33:29.269 --> 03:33:29.279 align:start position:0%
manager
 
03:33:33.889 --> 03:33:33.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:37.790 --> 03:33:37.800 align:start position:0%
is there a second on itl for a second
 
03:33:37.800 --> 03:33:43.729 align:start position:0%
is there a second on itl for a second
okay

03:33:43.729 --> 03:33:43.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:45.650 --> 03:33:45.660 align:start position:0%
do you care to speak to your motion uh
 
03:33:47.450 --> 03:33:47.460 align:start position:0%
yes Madam chair thank you
 
03:33:49.490 --> 03:33:49.500 align:start position:0%
um as I stated in the subcommittee
 
03:33:52.969 --> 03:33:52.979 align:start position:0%
um this year 436 has got to be our our
 
03:33:55.490 --> 03:33:55.500 align:start position:0%
main priority and focus and it's going
 
03:33:57.590 --> 03:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
to be quite expensive
 
03:33:58.969 --> 03:33:58.979 align:start position:0%
um a lot of people are finding
 
03:33:59.990 --> 03:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
themselves where they're in their
 
03:34:01.250 --> 03:34:01.260 align:start position:0%
they're in group two or not they're
 
03:34:02.389 --> 03:34:02.399 align:start position:0%
finding themselves in precarious
 
03:34:04.429 --> 03:34:04.439 align:start position:0%
situations financially uh due to
 
03:34:04.439 --> 03:34:05.929 align:start position:0%
situations financially uh due to
inflation

03:34:05.929 --> 03:34:05.939 align:start position:0%
inflation
 
03:34:08.929 --> 03:34:08.939 align:start position:0%
um and I don't want to force people who
 
03:34:10.309 --> 03:34:10.319 align:start position:0%
are not in group two who are in
 
03:34:13.849 --> 03:34:13.859 align:start position:0%
precarious situations to pay extra taxes
 
03:34:15.769 --> 03:34:15.779 align:start position:0%
um for this at this particular point in
 
03:34:15.779 --> 03:34:17.150 align:start position:0%
um for this at this particular point in
time

03:34:17.150 --> 03:34:17.160 align:start position:0%
time
 
03:34:18.710 --> 03:34:18.720 align:start position:0%
um so for those reasons I move and
 
03:34:20.690 --> 03:34:20.700 align:start position:0%
experience legislate all right
 
03:34:26.750 --> 03:34:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:29.210 --> 03:34:29.220 align:start position:0%
oh yeah no further comment thank you
 
03:34:31.969 --> 03:34:31.979 align:start position:0%
what I don't uh everything you said was
 
03:34:33.950 --> 03:34:33.960 align:start position:0%
great okay
 
03:34:36.410 --> 03:34:36.420 align:start position:0%
all right does anyone else wish to speak
 
03:34:40.130 --> 03:34:40.140 align:start position:0%
representative they bear and then Goldie
 
03:34:42.889 --> 03:34:42.899 align:start position:0%
thank you I support this motion but I
 
03:34:45.290 --> 03:34:45.300 align:start position:0%
want to make it clear why I do
 
03:34:49.969 --> 03:34:49.979 align:start position:0%
that I truly believe that 436 needs a
 
03:34:52.670 --> 03:34:52.680 align:start position:0%
lot of work as representative Simon
 
03:34:56.330 --> 03:34:56.340 align:start position:0%
indicated and that I
 
03:35:00.050 --> 03:35:00.060 align:start position:0%
am hesitant to push through too much and
 
03:35:02.929 --> 03:35:02.939 align:start position:0%
have us lose everything
 
03:35:05.210 --> 03:35:05.220 align:start position:0%
we know how contentious this has been
 
03:35:08.450 --> 03:35:08.460 align:start position:0%
year over year over year and I think our
 
03:35:11.570 --> 03:35:11.580 align:start position:0%
Focus needs to be on 436 it is not my
 
03:35:15.469 --> 03:35:15.479 align:start position:0%
intention to put retired firefighters
 
03:35:18.170 --> 03:35:18.180 align:start position:0%
over retired firefighters and police
 
03:35:18.180 --> 03:35:19.130 align:start position:0%
over retired firefighters and police
over

03:35:19.130 --> 03:35:19.140 align:start position:0%
over
 
03:35:21.650 --> 03:35:21.660 align:start position:0%
active firefighters and police
 
03:35:24.410 --> 03:35:24.420 align:start position:0%
that is not what this is about
 
03:35:25.969 --> 03:35:25.979 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:35:28.610 --> 03:35:28.620 align:start position:0%
okay other represent goalie
 
03:35:30.950 --> 03:35:30.960 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and let me try and
 
03:35:32.690 --> 03:35:32.700 align:start position:0%
win over representative Simon one more
 
03:35:32.700 --> 03:35:35.210 align:start position:0%
win over representative Simon one more
time

03:35:35.210 --> 03:35:35.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:36.889 --> 03:35:36.899 align:start position:0%
no to be honest
 
03:35:36.899 --> 03:35:37.610 align:start position:0%
no to be honest
um

03:35:37.610 --> 03:35:37.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:35:40.670 --> 03:35:40.680 align:start position:0%
I cannot support the itl motion
 
03:35:43.670 --> 03:35:43.680 align:start position:0%
um we are a policy committee not a money
 
03:35:47.330 --> 03:35:47.340 align:start position:0%
committee that is to be done in finance
 
03:35:49.969 --> 03:35:49.979 align:start position:0%
and I think the true policy here is
 
03:35:54.229 --> 03:35:54.239 align:start position:0%
whether or not those retirees uh deserve
 
03:35:56.809 --> 03:35:56.819 align:start position:0%
a cost of living adjustment
 
03:36:00.170 --> 03:36:00.180 align:start position:0%
we have to remember group two members
 
03:36:02.990 --> 03:36:03.000 align:start position:0%
do not pay into Social Security
 
03:36:05.750 --> 03:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
well that is for the jobs they're
 
03:36:07.910 --> 03:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
working as police fire or Corrections
 
03:36:10.309 --> 03:36:10.319 align:start position:0%
some may have a side job and pay social
 
03:36:12.469 --> 03:36:12.479 align:start position:0%
security on the other end but when they
 
03:36:13.670 --> 03:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
go to collect that Social Security
 
03:36:16.190 --> 03:36:16.200 align:start position:0%
they're getting it at probably 70
 
03:36:18.050 --> 03:36:18.060 align:start position:0%
percent of what they're entitled to
 
03:36:20.269 --> 03:36:20.279 align:start position:0%
because of what is called the windfall
 
03:36:23.269 --> 03:36:23.279 align:start position:0%
present um windfall Act that doesn't
 
03:36:25.070 --> 03:36:25.080 align:start position:0%
allow them to collect the full amount of
 
03:36:28.010 --> 03:36:28.020 align:start position:0%
Social Security they pay into
 
03:36:29.929 --> 03:36:29.939 align:start position:0%
group one members pay both Social
 
03:36:32.150 --> 03:36:32.160 align:start position:0%
Security and retirement they're able to
 
03:36:33.650 --> 03:36:33.660 align:start position:0%
collect on the cost of living
 
03:36:35.210 --> 03:36:35.220 align:start position:0%
adjustments that were just handed out
 
03:36:38.929 --> 03:36:38.939 align:start position:0%
this year by the federal government and
 
03:36:43.250 --> 03:36:43.260 align:start position:0%
group two employees don't see that so
 
03:36:46.010 --> 03:36:46.020 align:start position:0%
to stay up with the economy and as we
 
03:36:47.929 --> 03:36:47.939 align:start position:0%
all see cost of living increases in our
 
03:36:51.170 --> 03:36:51.180 align:start position:0%
food heating oil gas prices
 
03:36:56.090 --> 03:36:56.100 align:start position:0%
um I look at this as going forward
 
03:36:58.610 --> 03:36:58.620 align:start position:0%
a policy issue that this committee needs
 
03:37:00.830 --> 03:37:00.840 align:start position:0%
to address how it's funded or whether
 
03:37:04.070 --> 03:37:04.080 align:start position:0%
it's funded I believe belongs in finance
 
03:37:06.170 --> 03:37:06.180 align:start position:0%
so I'm not going to support the ITIL
 
03:37:08.290 --> 03:37:08.300 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
03:37:12.830 --> 03:37:12.840 align:start position:0%
representative O'Brien and then
 
03:37:17.150 --> 03:37:17.160 align:start position:0%
no Brian okay thank you madam chip I uh
 
03:37:20.510 --> 03:37:20.520 align:start position:0%
I am not going to support this and yet I
 
03:37:23.150 --> 03:37:23.160 align:start position:0%
agree totally to what uh representative
 
03:37:26.030 --> 03:37:26.040 align:start position:0%
goalie has said but to come up with his
 
03:37:30.110 --> 03:37:30.120 align:start position:0%
own uh when I sit in this chair
 
03:37:32.809 --> 03:37:32.819 align:start position:0%
I try to judge as best as I possibly can
 
03:37:34.849 --> 03:37:34.859 align:start position:0%
without fear and favor and not
 
03:37:38.990 --> 03:37:39.000 align:start position:0%
intimidated by any other committee
 
03:37:41.809 --> 03:37:41.819 align:start position:0%
that is not up to me to judge that what
 
03:37:44.690 --> 03:37:44.700 align:start position:0%
another committee is going to do when as
 
03:37:46.429 --> 03:37:46.439 align:start position:0%
you know as Representatives when we
 
03:37:49.130 --> 03:37:49.140 align:start position:0%
write a bill we hand a bill over to the
 
03:37:52.070 --> 03:37:52.080 align:start position:0%
committee it's no longer our bill
 
03:37:54.590 --> 03:37:54.600 align:start position:0%
it becomes a property of that committee
 
03:37:56.929 --> 03:37:56.939 align:start position:0%
and they make that particular decision
 
03:37:59.809 --> 03:37:59.819 align:start position:0%
on what they want to adjudicate on as
 
03:38:03.170 --> 03:38:03.180 align:start position:0%
far as their decision we are a policy
 
03:38:03.180 --> 03:38:04.309 align:start position:0%
far as their decision we are a policy
committee

03:38:04.309 --> 03:38:04.319 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:38:06.530 --> 03:38:06.540 align:start position:0%
okay and with deep respective
 
03:38:08.510 --> 03:38:08.520 align:start position:0%
representative Simon I understand
 
03:38:10.849 --> 03:38:10.859 align:start position:0%
sometimes you can go to the well too
 
03:38:13.130 --> 03:38:13.140 align:start position:0%
much in the gorgeous help with water you
 
03:38:15.530 --> 03:38:15.540 align:start position:0%
can ask too many times I completely it's
 
03:38:18.110 --> 03:38:18.120 align:start position:0%
a well-thought idea but then that's
 
03:38:21.889 --> 03:38:21.899 align:start position:0%
ruling by fear and favor because what
 
03:38:25.550 --> 03:38:25.560 align:start position:0%
would happen is all it seems in the past
 
03:38:27.830 --> 03:38:27.840 align:start position:0%
that I'm not pointing any blames but
 
03:38:30.469 --> 03:38:30.479 align:start position:0%
this particular group has been very a
 
03:38:33.410 --> 03:38:33.420 align:start position:0%
lot of mileage in years since the last
 
03:38:35.269 --> 03:38:35.279 align:start position:0%
time they received a cost of living
 
03:38:38.090 --> 03:38:38.100 align:start position:0%
increase if the time isn't right now
 
03:38:40.429 --> 03:38:40.439 align:start position:0%
then I gotta ask you the proverbial
 
03:38:43.370 --> 03:38:43.380 align:start position:0%
question is next year correct
 
03:38:45.050 --> 03:38:45.060 align:start position:0%
or the year after
 
03:38:48.650 --> 03:38:48.660 align:start position:0%
when are we gonna you know find out when
 
03:38:51.650 --> 03:38:51.660 align:start position:0%
the proper time is going to be so the
 
03:38:53.809 --> 03:38:53.819 align:start position:0%
thing is this is why we have our former
 
03:38:56.269 --> 03:38:56.279 align:start position:0%
government where the policy committee we
 
03:38:57.889 --> 03:38:57.899 align:start position:0%
should push this forward to the next
 
03:39:00.229 --> 03:39:00.239 align:start position:0%
committee which would be financed and
 
03:39:02.630 --> 03:39:02.640 align:start position:0%
allow them to determine if they can
 
03:39:05.450 --> 03:39:05.460 align:start position:0%
afford this if they cannot we'll write
 
03:39:07.969 --> 03:39:07.979 align:start position:0%
back to where we are in the in the
 
03:39:11.630 --> 03:39:11.640 align:start position:0%
position of itl my recommendation is
 
03:39:13.729 --> 03:39:13.739 align:start position:0%
that to change the vote and go for ought
 
03:39:15.889 --> 03:39:15.899 align:start position:0%
to pass to assist the people who
 
03:39:18.229 --> 03:39:18.239 align:start position:0%
dedicated their lives to their own
 
03:39:20.210 --> 03:39:20.220 align:start position:0%
respected communities
 
03:39:27.769 --> 03:39:27.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:30.050 --> 03:39:30.060 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
03:39:31.910 --> 03:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
thank you representative O'Brien for
 
03:39:33.410 --> 03:39:33.420 align:start position:0%
that testimony
 
03:39:34.910 --> 03:39:34.920 align:start position:0%
I'd like to take a different tact on
 
03:39:34.920 --> 03:39:35.809 align:start position:0%
I'd like to take a different tact on
this

03:39:35.809 --> 03:39:35.819 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:39:38.389 --> 03:39:38.399 align:start position:0%
my concern is that we're both what we're
 
03:39:39.830 --> 03:39:39.840 align:start position:0%
doing if we go forward with this and
 
03:39:42.050 --> 03:39:42.060 align:start position:0%
just OTP it we're pitting one group of
 
03:39:43.670 --> 03:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
seniors against another group so in my
 
03:39:45.769 --> 03:39:45.779 align:start position:0%
town Northfield there's 65 I believe it
 
03:39:47.090 --> 03:39:47.100 align:start position:0%
was seniors that are applying for
 
03:39:49.490 --> 03:39:49.500 align:start position:0%
property tax exemptions well waivers for
 
03:39:51.590 --> 03:39:51.600 align:start position:0%
the um interest fees because they can't
 
03:39:53.929 --> 03:39:53.939 align:start position:0%
pay their property taxes and I'm just
 
03:39:55.610 --> 03:39:55.620 align:start position:0%
worrying that by benefiting this group
 
03:39:57.050 --> 03:39:57.060 align:start position:0%
now we're going to be putting them in
 
03:39:59.330 --> 03:39:59.340 align:start position:0%
danger of losing their homes so my whole
 
03:40:00.769 --> 03:40:00.779 align:start position:0%
issue is inflation's coming from the
 
03:40:02.330 --> 03:40:02.340 align:start position:0%
federal government why aren't we dealing
 
03:40:03.650 --> 03:40:03.660 align:start position:0%
with that at that level and I believe
 
03:40:05.929 --> 03:40:05.939 align:start position:0%
there's mechanisms that we can do so for
 
03:40:07.490 --> 03:40:07.500 align:start position:0%
instance there's a dollar per pack it's
 
03:40:09.950 --> 03:40:09.960 align:start position:0%
actually 101 per pack of cigarettes
 
03:40:11.750 --> 03:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
there has to be some mechanism why we
 
03:40:13.250 --> 03:40:13.260 align:start position:0%
can say where we can say okay you know
 
03:40:14.630 --> 03:40:14.640 align:start position:0%
what we're tired of sending you money
 
03:40:16.490 --> 03:40:16.500 align:start position:0%
because obviously you're just deflating
 
03:40:18.530 --> 03:40:18.540 align:start position:0%
our currency as it is that's my whole
 
03:40:20.389 --> 03:40:20.399 align:start position:0%
position on that I I'm just worried
 
03:40:21.469 --> 03:40:21.479 align:start position:0%
about pitting one group against another
 
03:40:23.510 --> 03:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
group one real our real problem is who's
 
03:40:24.889 --> 03:40:24.899 align:start position:0%
praying the money like it's going out of
 
03:40:24.899 --> 03:40:26.330 align:start position:0%
praying the money like it's going out of
style

03:40:26.330 --> 03:40:26.340 align:start position:0%
style
 
03:40:29.269 --> 03:40:29.279 align:start position:0%
uh thank you and Madam chair this is not
 
03:40:31.670 --> 03:40:31.680 align:start position:0%
going to be a debate I respect the
 
03:40:35.269 --> 03:40:35.279 align:start position:0%
gentleman's uh point of view but from my
 
03:40:36.950 --> 03:40:36.960 align:start position:0%
experience as vice president on the
 
03:40:39.229 --> 03:40:39.239 align:start position:0%
board of aldermen we do give out elderly
 
03:40:42.710 --> 03:40:42.720 align:start position:0%
exemptions okay but that liability
 
03:40:44.630 --> 03:40:44.640 align:start position:0%
you know that isn't a gift from City
 
03:40:44.640 --> 03:40:45.469 align:start position:0%
you know that isn't a gift from City
Hall

03:40:45.469 --> 03:40:45.479 align:start position:0%
Hall
 
03:40:48.889 --> 03:40:48.899 align:start position:0%
that is met by somebody else and in in
 
03:40:51.650 --> 03:40:51.660 align:start position:0%
this particular case yes it would be met
 
03:40:55.490 --> 03:40:55.500 align:start position:0%
but the thing is this is people uh if I
 
03:40:58.070 --> 03:40:58.080 align:start position:0%
had my most idyllic world and
 
03:40:59.990 --> 03:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
fortunately you're a young fella you're
 
03:41:02.150 --> 03:41:02.160 align:start position:0%
not ready to cross that elderly bridge
 
03:41:04.849 --> 03:41:04.859 align:start position:0%
yet and God bless you for that but the
 
03:41:07.010 --> 03:41:07.020 align:start position:0%
point I'm trying to make is as you get
 
03:41:09.610 --> 03:41:09.620 align:start position:0%
older your spending power are
 
03:41:13.370 --> 03:41:13.380 align:start position:0%
receivables decreases okay and when if
 
03:41:15.590 --> 03:41:15.600 align:start position:0%
you're on a defined benefit program such
 
03:41:18.290 --> 03:41:18.300 align:start position:0%
as this which the guy most of the
 
03:41:20.690 --> 03:41:20.700 align:start position:0%
firefighters and group two employees do
 
03:41:22.910 --> 03:41:22.920 align:start position:0%
not get the social security so they're
 
03:41:24.410 --> 03:41:24.420 align:start position:0%
not getting the bump up at that
 
03:41:26.990 --> 03:41:27.000 align:start position:0%
particular time so they're frozen in
 
03:41:28.550 --> 03:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
time you might as well and Cake them in
 
03:41:28.560 --> 03:41:29.330 align:start position:0%
time you might as well and Cake them in
nice

03:41:29.330 --> 03:41:29.340 align:start position:0%
nice
 
03:41:31.969 --> 03:41:31.979 align:start position:0%
okay and they are going to be the
 
03:41:34.309 --> 03:41:34.319 align:start position:0%
problem in the community because what's
 
03:41:36.950 --> 03:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
going to happen at some point without a
 
03:41:39.830 --> 03:41:39.840 align:start position:0%
cola they're going to become less means
 
03:41:42.170 --> 03:41:42.180 align:start position:0%
to be able to afford their housing
 
03:41:43.910 --> 03:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
they may be kicked out of their
 
03:41:46.729 --> 03:41:46.739 align:start position:0%
particular housing might be defaults
 
03:41:49.250 --> 03:41:49.260 align:start position:0%
worst case scenarios can happen when you
 
03:41:51.469 --> 03:41:51.479 align:start position:0%
have no other means of income you've got
 
03:41:53.929 --> 03:41:53.939 align:start position:0%
to tell an 80 year old guy to go out and
 
03:42:00.790 --> 03:42:00.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:03.729 --> 03:42:03.739 align:start position:0%
presenting a very extreme position
 
03:42:05.809 --> 03:42:05.819 align:start position:0%
representative Simon
 
03:42:07.910 --> 03:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and uh
 
03:42:10.429 --> 03:42:10.439 align:start position:0%
representative O'Brien the respect is is
 
03:42:12.769 --> 03:42:12.779 align:start position:0%
absolutely Mutual
 
03:42:14.389 --> 03:42:14.399 align:start position:0%
um I just want to clarify I'm not making
 
03:42:17.030 --> 03:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
an argument simply based off of money
 
03:42:18.590 --> 03:42:18.600 align:start position:0%
and whether or not we should be spending
 
03:42:20.929 --> 03:42:20.939 align:start position:0%
the 82 or 84 million dollars that this
 
03:42:24.769 --> 03:42:24.779 align:start position:0%
bill is asking us to spend my contention
 
03:42:26.330 --> 03:42:26.340 align:start position:0%
with it is that
 
03:42:30.769 --> 03:42:30.779 align:start position:0%
when the members of group 2 agreed to
 
03:42:33.590 --> 03:42:33.600 align:start position:0%
their defined benefits package they were
 
03:42:35.630 --> 03:42:35.640 align:start position:0%
agreeing to a package and that package
 
03:42:40.190 --> 03:42:40.200 align:start position:0%
did not include a yearly Cola
 
03:42:42.290 --> 03:42:42.300 align:start position:0%
um it didn't it didn't agree to a cola
 
03:42:44.570 --> 03:42:44.580 align:start position:0%
at any point in the future so from my
 
03:42:46.490 --> 03:42:46.500 align:start position:0%
perspective this is a policy decision in
 
03:42:47.990 --> 03:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
which I
 
03:42:51.110 --> 03:42:51.120 align:start position:0%
fully uh sympathetic to the difficult
 
03:42:52.729 --> 03:42:52.739 align:start position:0%
situations that we all find ourselves in
 
03:42:54.290 --> 03:42:54.300 align:start position:0%
as we get older
 
03:42:55.910 --> 03:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
um group two members are no different
 
03:42:57.650 --> 03:42:57.660 align:start position:0%
than that but neither are any other
 
03:42:57.660 --> 03:42:59.090 align:start position:0%
than that but neither are any other
citizen

03:42:59.090 --> 03:42:59.100 align:start position:0%
citizen
 
03:43:01.010 --> 03:43:01.020 align:start position:0%
um in the state and because the benefit
 
03:43:05.210 --> 03:43:05.220 align:start position:0%
package did not include a cola
 
03:43:07.250 --> 03:43:07.260 align:start position:0%
I don't feel that we're under obligation
 
03:43:09.170 --> 03:43:09.180 align:start position:0%
to favor them because at that point we
 
03:43:10.670 --> 03:43:10.680 align:start position:0%
are it wasn't in their benefits package
 
03:43:12.710 --> 03:43:12.720 align:start position:0%
we're favoring them over other people
 
03:43:14.570 --> 03:43:14.580 align:start position:0%
and those other people are the ones who
 
03:43:15.650 --> 03:43:15.660 align:start position:0%
are going to be footing the bill for
 
03:43:17.750 --> 03:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
this so all of the examples that you
 
03:43:19.670 --> 03:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
just gave in your testimony
 
03:43:22.010 --> 03:43:22.020 align:start position:0%
um can be applied to people outside of
 
03:43:23.150 --> 03:43:23.160 align:start position:0%
group 2.
 
03:43:25.670 --> 03:43:25.680 align:start position:0%
and once again furthermore because of
 
03:43:27.290 --> 03:43:27.300 align:start position:0%
the way that we fund this
 
03:43:28.969 --> 03:43:28.979 align:start position:0%
those other people who can find
 
03:43:30.830 --> 03:43:30.840 align:start position:0%
themselves in the same situation are
 
03:43:33.530 --> 03:43:33.540 align:start position:0%
then going to be taxed more in order to
 
03:43:36.290 --> 03:43:36.300 align:start position:0%
pay for this benefit and so it's it's
 
03:43:39.590 --> 03:43:39.600 align:start position:0%
not a in my perspective from that's that
 
03:43:41.570 --> 03:43:41.580 align:start position:0%
is a policy issue I am making that
 
03:43:43.010 --> 03:43:43.020 align:start position:0%
determination on a policy issue and
 
03:43:45.050 --> 03:43:45.060 align:start position:0%
that's why that's the primary reason why
 
03:43:47.450 --> 03:43:47.460 align:start position:0%
I'm moving itl I could I could stomach
 
03:43:49.610 --> 03:43:49.620 align:start position:0%
the 84 million if you know like if it
 
03:43:51.229 --> 03:43:51.239 align:start position:0%
was a good enough reason
 
03:43:52.490 --> 03:43:52.500 align:start position:0%
um it's a policy thing that's got me
 
03:43:52.500 --> 03:43:54.349 align:start position:0%
um it's a policy thing that's got me
concerned

03:43:54.349 --> 03:43:54.359 align:start position:0%
concerned
 
03:43:54.359 --> 03:43:55.849 align:start position:0%
concerned
okay

03:43:55.849 --> 03:43:55.859 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:43:58.670 --> 03:43:58.680 align:start position:0%
representative goalie thank you madam
 
03:44:01.490 --> 03:44:01.500 align:start position:0%
chair and just to address the cost of
 
03:44:03.650 --> 03:44:03.660 align:start position:0%
living adjustment Marty correct me if
 
03:44:05.570 --> 03:44:05.580 align:start position:0%
I'm wrong was there not a supplemental
 
03:44:07.849 --> 03:44:07.859 align:start position:0%
account that provided some colas
 
03:44:07.859 --> 03:44:09.830 align:start position:0%
account that provided some colas
previously

03:44:09.830 --> 03:44:09.840 align:start position:0%
previously
 
03:44:11.450 --> 03:44:11.460 align:start position:0%
in the retirement system or what's the
 
03:44:12.889 --> 03:44:12.899 align:start position:0%
history of that answer that question
 
03:44:15.889 --> 03:44:15.899 align:start position:0%
there was a cola there was a a special
 
03:44:17.690 --> 03:44:17.700 align:start position:0%
account that funded cost of living
 
03:44:20.210 --> 03:44:20.220 align:start position:0%
increases but the money that went into
 
03:44:24.250 --> 03:44:24.260 align:start position:0%
it was only made available by
 
03:44:27.550 --> 03:44:27.560 align:start position:0%
inaccurate and in hindsight foolish
 
03:44:30.889 --> 03:44:30.899 align:start position:0%
Actuarial assumptions
 
03:44:33.710 --> 03:44:33.720 align:start position:0%
if I may respond but there was colas
 
03:44:35.809 --> 03:44:35.819 align:start position:0%
being provided which we just heard there
 
03:44:37.309 --> 03:44:37.319 align:start position:0%
were not and when the people signed up
 
03:44:40.670 --> 03:44:40.680 align:start position:0%
but there were colas that were provided
 
03:44:43.490 --> 03:44:43.500 align:start position:0%
yes there have been cost to living
 
03:44:47.510 --> 03:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
increases granted periodically through
 
03:44:51.969 --> 03:44:51.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:55.309 --> 03:44:55.319 align:start position:0%
absolutely right anyone I would like to
 
03:44:57.830 --> 03:44:57.840 align:start position:0%
comment that I think the approach to
 
03:45:01.030 --> 03:45:01.040 align:start position:0%
this bill by
 
03:45:03.950 --> 03:45:03.960 align:start position:0%
specifying only group two members
 
03:45:03.960 --> 03:45:05.469 align:start position:0%
specifying only group two members
is

03:45:05.469 --> 03:45:05.479 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:45:10.010 --> 03:45:10.020 align:start position:0%
divisive and somewhat discriminatory and
 
03:45:12.170 --> 03:45:12.180 align:start position:0%
I understand why you did it because it
 
03:45:15.290 --> 03:45:15.300 align:start position:0%
is somewhat a supplement to Social
 
03:45:18.170 --> 03:45:18.180 align:start position:0%
Security but I think that the approach
 
03:45:18.180 --> 03:45:19.790 align:start position:0%
Security but I think that the approach
is

03:45:19.790 --> 03:45:19.800 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:45:19.800 --> 03:45:21.290 align:start position:0%
is
um

03:45:21.290 --> 03:45:21.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:45:24.830 --> 03:45:24.840 align:start position:0%
is bad policy in my opinion
 
03:45:28.429 --> 03:45:28.439 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to be supporting the motion
 
03:45:30.530 --> 03:45:30.540 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
03:45:33.309 --> 03:45:33.319 align:start position:0%
yes representative O'Brien
 
03:45:36.410 --> 03:45:36.420 align:start position:0%
you tweaked my melon that I got for her
 
03:45:39.050 --> 03:45:39.060 align:start position:0%
years that I was born with if if Madam
 
03:45:41.510 --> 03:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
chair if you feel that way are you in
 
03:45:43.670 --> 03:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
essence saying that maybe we're going
 
03:45:45.650 --> 03:45:45.660 align:start position:0%
around this the wrong way and maybe this
 
03:45:47.929 --> 03:45:47.939 align:start position:0%
bill could be held in work for further
 
03:45:51.410 --> 03:45:51.420 align:start position:0%
amendments that that you feel that any
 
03:45:53.630 --> 03:45:53.640 align:start position:0%
uh way to go it because we are talking
 
03:45:56.929 --> 03:45:56.939 align:start position:0%
about a very very important issue and
 
03:45:59.330 --> 03:45:59.340 align:start position:0%
supplementing the income of some of uh
 
03:46:02.929 --> 03:46:02.939 align:start position:0%
less fortunate who only sin is
 
03:46:05.990 --> 03:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:08.690 --> 03:46:08.700 align:start position:0%
yes well I would wouldn't say that
 
03:46:10.929 --> 03:46:10.939 align:start position:0%
that's their only sin
 
03:46:14.870 --> 03:46:14.880 align:start position:0%
uh I'm old I'm retired and I know that
 
03:46:17.150 --> 03:46:17.160 align:start position:0%
when I was working I had a defined
 
03:46:20.090 --> 03:46:20.100 align:start position:0%
benefit pension and I looked at it and
 
03:46:21.590 --> 03:46:21.600 align:start position:0%
said I'm not going to be able to live on
 
03:46:21.600 --> 03:46:22.370 align:start position:0%
said I'm not going to be able to live on
this

03:46:22.370 --> 03:46:22.380 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:46:24.650 --> 03:46:24.660 align:start position:0%
and so I took steps to make sure I had
 
03:46:27.050 --> 03:46:27.060 align:start position:0%
other funds available and I would not
 
03:46:29.150 --> 03:46:29.160 align:start position:0%
insult the intelligence of our police
 
03:46:31.670 --> 03:46:31.680 align:start position:0%
and firefighters to say that they
 
03:46:33.710 --> 03:46:33.720 align:start position:0%
couldn't have realized that themselves
 
03:46:37.250 --> 03:46:37.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:41.090 --> 03:46:41.100 align:start position:0%
and the same for our group one employees
 
03:46:44.750 --> 03:46:44.760 align:start position:0%
I mean we all all of us retirees were
 
03:46:47.450 --> 03:46:47.460 align:start position:0%
working in the late 70s and early 80s
 
03:46:50.469 --> 03:46:50.479 align:start position:0%
when inflation was rampant
 
03:46:53.570 --> 03:46:53.580 align:start position:0%
we we know that it can happen
 
03:46:56.389 --> 03:46:56.399 align:start position:0%
so if we didn't take steps we are
 
03:46:59.630 --> 03:46:59.640 align:start position:0%
gambling on the charity and the mercy of
 
03:47:01.849 --> 03:47:01.859 align:start position:0%
the legislature
 
03:47:04.250 --> 03:47:04.260 align:start position:0%
to to give us money and to charge our
 
03:47:07.790 --> 03:47:07.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:11.990 --> 03:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
that's that's my position on the policy
 
03:47:14.330 --> 03:47:14.340 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up
 
03:47:16.490 --> 03:47:16.500 align:start position:0%
that's your position so there's no
 
03:47:18.050 --> 03:47:18.060 align:start position:0%
saving of this
 
03:47:20.030 --> 03:47:20.040 align:start position:0%
that you can see we'll see what the
 
03:47:21.710 --> 03:47:21.720 align:start position:0%
committee decides I'm not the only one
 
03:47:24.590 --> 03:47:24.600 align:start position:0%
with the position thank you madam chair
 
03:47:26.870 --> 03:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
all right anyone else
 
03:47:29.330 --> 03:47:29.340 align:start position:0%
representative Dolan yes uh thank you
 
03:47:30.650 --> 03:47:30.660 align:start position:0%
madam chair I just would encourage you
 
03:47:32.510 --> 03:47:32.520 align:start position:0%
to move the question
 
03:47:34.250 --> 03:47:34.260 align:start position:0%
what's that I would just encourage you
 
03:47:36.190 --> 03:47:36.200 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
03:47:38.630 --> 03:47:38.640 align:start position:0%
uh thank you we can't do that in
 
03:47:42.050 --> 03:47:42.060 align:start position:0%
committee debate in committee executive
 
03:47:44.150 --> 03:47:44.160 align:start position:0%
session cannot be cut short for any
 
03:47:44.160 --> 03:47:45.469 align:start position:0%
session cannot be cut short for any
reason

03:47:45.469 --> 03:47:45.479 align:start position:0%
reason
 
03:47:47.690 --> 03:47:47.700 align:start position:0%
except of course lack of Interest by the
 
03:47:49.610 --> 03:47:49.620 align:start position:0%
other members when they uh
 
03:47:52.250 --> 03:47:52.260 align:start position:0%
that's the only reason all right
 
03:47:54.830 --> 03:47:54.840 align:start position:0%
anyone else representative a bear
 
03:47:57.229 --> 03:47:57.239 align:start position:0%
so could I just get clarification before
 
03:48:00.830 --> 03:48:00.840 align:start position:0%
the vote was there a cola and then there
 
03:48:02.510 --> 03:48:02.520 align:start position:0%
wasn't a cola and now we're trying to
 
03:48:05.630 --> 03:48:05.640 align:start position:0%
put a cola back in no ever since the
 
03:48:07.809 --> 03:48:07.819 align:start position:0%
retirement system
 
03:48:10.550 --> 03:48:10.560 align:start position:0%
started there have been various
 
03:48:13.130 --> 03:48:13.140 align:start position:0%
increases given in pensions sometimes
 
03:48:15.530 --> 03:48:15.540 align:start position:0%
one-time payments sometimes complete
 
03:48:19.190 --> 03:48:19.200 align:start position:0%
colas they were always ad hoc and at the
 
03:48:21.410 --> 03:48:21.420 align:start position:0%
will of the legislature they are not in
 
03:48:23.809 --> 03:48:23.819 align:start position:0%
the plan there's no money saved up for
 
03:48:27.410 --> 03:48:27.420 align:start position:0%
them and they are not guaranteed
 
03:48:30.290 --> 03:48:30.300 align:start position:0%
so there there have been many cases in
 
03:48:33.950 --> 03:48:33.960 align:start position:0%
the past where colas were given
 
03:48:38.389 --> 03:48:38.399 align:start position:0%
but again they they're not in the plan
 
03:48:43.190 --> 03:48:43.200 align:start position:0%
representative thank you uh possible
 
03:48:43.200 --> 03:48:43.849 align:start position:0%
representative thank you uh possible
um

03:48:43.849 --> 03:48:43.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:48:46.670 --> 03:48:46.680 align:start position:0%
clarification of Representative Aver's
 
03:48:51.710 --> 03:48:51.720 align:start position:0%
question the last term there was a
 
03:48:54.590 --> 03:48:54.600 align:start position:0%
one-time payment that was made to
 
03:48:57.830 --> 03:48:57.840 align:start position:0%
retirees but it was only to those who
 
03:49:01.190 --> 03:49:01.200 align:start position:0%
made thirty thousand dollars or less
 
03:49:05.929 --> 03:49:05.939 align:start position:0%
in most cases group 2 retirements are
 
03:49:09.349 --> 03:49:09.359 align:start position:0%
slightly more than that however so they
 
03:49:12.050 --> 03:49:12.060 align:start position:0%
were not included because it was capped
 
03:49:13.790 --> 03:49:13.800 align:start position:0%
at that amount and it was a one-time
 
03:49:15.830 --> 03:49:15.840 align:start position:0%
only payment
 
03:49:15.840 --> 03:49:17.450 align:start position:0%
only payment
and

03:49:17.450 --> 03:49:17.460 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:49:20.210 --> 03:49:20.220 align:start position:0%
um most of the group two retirees
 
03:49:23.690 --> 03:49:23.700 align:start position:0%
probably make around 40
 
03:49:27.349 --> 03:49:27.359 align:start position:0%
000 maybe 50 000 in retirement but don't
 
03:49:29.630 --> 03:49:29.640 align:start position:0%
get anything added to that in the way of
 
03:49:32.570 --> 03:49:32.580 align:start position:0%
Social Security bear that in mind so
 
03:49:35.090 --> 03:49:35.100 align:start position:0%
they were basically excluded from that
 
03:49:36.830 --> 03:49:36.840 align:start position:0%
one-time payment
 
03:49:39.710 --> 03:49:39.720 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair yes that is
 
03:49:41.929 --> 03:49:41.939 align:start position:0%
correct anyone else
 
03:49:44.809 --> 03:49:44.819 align:start position:0%
okay in that case the motion is
 
03:49:46.849 --> 03:49:46.859 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate by
 
03:49:49.670 --> 03:49:49.680 align:start position:0%

all right
 
03:53:04.729 --> 03:53:04.739 align:start position:0%
moving away from pensions for a moment
 
03:53:09.110 --> 03:53:09.120 align:start position:0%
uh House Bill 341 establishing licensure
 
03:53:11.929 --> 03:53:11.939 align:start position:0%

okay
 
03:53:27.710 --> 03:53:27.720 align:start position:0%
I do wish to speak to your motion
 
03:53:31.969 --> 03:53:31.979 align:start position:0%
yes uh 341 uh it looks like the intent
 
03:53:34.849 --> 03:53:34.859 align:start position:0%
to establish licensing for massages is
 
03:53:38.570 --> 03:53:38.580 align:start position:0%
to prevent uh sex trafficking
 
03:53:40.849 --> 03:53:40.859 align:start position:0%
um and I don't believe that this is
 
03:53:45.170 --> 03:53:45.180 align:start position:0%
gonna solve the problem uh the um it's
 
03:53:46.729 --> 03:53:46.739 align:start position:0%
kind of uh we already have like law
 
03:53:48.650 --> 03:53:48.660 align:start position:0%
enforcement to look into these things
 
03:53:50.150 --> 03:53:50.160 align:start position:0%
and produce warrants to enter
 
03:53:53.229 --> 03:53:53.239 align:start position:0%
establishments and uh the
 
03:53:57.590 --> 03:53:57.600 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor for not registering uh is
 
03:53:58.969 --> 03:53:58.979 align:start position:0%
that's not going to be enough incentive
 
03:54:01.250 --> 03:54:01.260 align:start position:0%
for people to to either just continue
 
03:54:02.870 --> 03:54:02.880 align:start position:0%
doing it without a license they're not
 
03:54:05.210 --> 03:54:05.220 align:start position:0%
gonna comply with this if they are
 
03:54:07.010 --> 03:54:07.020 align:start position:0%
actually doing uh having a sex
 
03:54:08.809 --> 03:54:08.819 align:start position:0%
trafficking operation they're not going
 
03:54:10.190 --> 03:54:10.200 align:start position:0%
to go ahead and get licensed so they can
 
03:54:12.110 --> 03:54:12.120 align:start position:0%
business can be looked into so I don't
 
03:54:16.370 --> 03:54:16.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:18.170 --> 03:54:18.180 align:start position:0%
representative Gerhard
 
03:54:20.090 --> 03:54:20.100 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
03:54:21.889 --> 03:54:21.899 align:start position:0%
going back to the original testimony on
 
03:54:23.450 --> 03:54:23.460 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
03:54:25.969 --> 03:54:25.979 align:start position:0%
there was a massage
 
03:54:28.130 --> 03:54:28.140 align:start position:0%
masseuse who submitted testimony that
 
03:54:30.610 --> 03:54:30.620 align:start position:0%
she contacted the police for
 
03:54:32.929 --> 03:54:32.939 align:start position:0%
propositions of Performing services that
 
03:54:35.090 --> 03:54:35.100 align:start position:0%
are extracurricular in the field and the
 
03:54:36.950 --> 03:54:36.960 align:start position:0%
police weren't interested as well as the
 
03:54:39.410 --> 03:54:39.420 align:start position:0%
fact that local police we were told were
 
03:54:41.570 --> 03:54:41.580 align:start position:0%
not enforcing ordinances they just
 
03:54:43.969 --> 03:54:43.979 align:start position:0%
didn't feel his priority so if local
 
03:54:45.710 --> 03:54:45.720 align:start position:0%
entities are not concerned with this I
 
03:54:47.330 --> 03:54:47.340 align:start position:0%
don't see the point in having the state
 
03:54:48.650 --> 03:54:48.660 align:start position:0%
step in
 
03:54:56.030 --> 03:54:56.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:58.550 --> 03:54:58.560 align:start position:0%
excuse me I'll be voting against the itl
 
03:55:02.210 --> 03:55:02.220 align:start position:0%
motion in testimony the bill was brought
 
03:55:05.650 --> 03:55:05.660 align:start position:0%
forth because other businesses are also
 
03:55:07.790 --> 03:55:07.800 align:start position:0%
licensed such as the pharmaceutical
 
03:55:11.090 --> 03:55:11.100 align:start position:0%
board and other similar boards and this
 
03:55:13.330 --> 03:55:13.340 align:start position:0%
is not a law enforcement
 
03:55:16.790 --> 03:55:16.800 align:start position:0%
proposition this is a public safety bill
 
03:55:19.910 --> 03:55:19.920 align:start position:0%
and lastly I do have an amendment to
 
03:55:23.330 --> 03:55:23.340 align:start position:0%
House Bill 341 which I can introduce at
 
03:55:25.490 --> 03:55:25.500 align:start position:0%
a later time so I'll be voting against
 
03:55:29.809 --> 03:55:29.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:32.570 --> 03:55:32.580 align:start position:0%
uh I'd like to comment that a
 
03:55:35.689 --> 03:55:35.699 align:start position:0%
substantial portion of the regulated
 
03:55:38.689 --> 03:55:38.699 align:start position:0%
Community was opposed to the bill which
 
03:55:41.450 --> 03:55:41.460 align:start position:0%
is generally a red flag for imposing a
 
03:55:42.950 --> 03:55:42.960 align:start position:0%
new license
 
03:55:42.960 --> 03:55:44.330 align:start position:0%
new license
uh

03:55:44.330 --> 03:55:44.340 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:55:46.729 --> 03:55:46.739 align:start position:0%
they may have been organized by a group
 
03:55:49.130 --> 03:55:49.140 align:start position:0%
outside the state representative Schmidt
 
03:55:51.469 --> 03:55:51.479 align:start position:0%
but they are in fact New Hampshire
 
03:55:54.410 --> 03:55:54.420 align:start position:0%
businesses and they are they are working
 
03:55:56.570 --> 03:55:56.580 align:start position:0%
here they're licensed by the board of
 
03:55:59.030 --> 03:55:59.040 align:start position:0%
massage therapists and they don't want
 
03:56:01.250 --> 03:56:01.260 align:start position:0%
to have this additional license imposed
 
03:56:04.910 --> 03:56:04.920 align:start position:0%
on them I'm very much concerned that we
 
03:56:04.920 --> 03:56:05.689 align:start position:0%
on them I'm very much concerned that we
are

03:56:05.689 --> 03:56:05.699 align:start position:0%
are
 
03:56:08.090 --> 03:56:08.100 align:start position:0%
putting restrictions on our small
 
03:56:10.969 --> 03:56:10.979 align:start position:0%
businesses in order to make it easier
 
03:56:13.370 --> 03:56:13.380 align:start position:0%
for law enforcement to Target some of
 
03:56:16.969 --> 03:56:16.979 align:start position:0%
the bigger ones that are uh that are the
 
03:56:18.410 --> 03:56:18.420 align:start position:0%
bad apples
 
03:56:20.450 --> 03:56:20.460 align:start position:0%
and that's something that I don't think
 
03:56:23.269 --> 03:56:23.279 align:start position:0%
is right I'm also very concerned that
 
03:56:23.279 --> 03:56:24.050 align:start position:0%
is right I'm also very concerned that
we're

03:56:24.050 --> 03:56:24.060 align:start position:0%
we're
 
03:56:26.809 --> 03:56:26.819 align:start position:0%
willing to use our
 
03:56:30.050 --> 03:56:30.060 align:start position:0%
licensing organization as law
 
03:56:32.689 --> 03:56:32.699 align:start position:0%
enforcement I can't imagine
 
03:56:35.090 --> 03:56:35.100 align:start position:0%
getting your license CL somebody from
 
03:56:37.370 --> 03:56:37.380 align:start position:0%
the oplc saying hi I'm here from the
 
03:56:39.950 --> 03:56:39.960 align:start position:0%
oplc please show me your your licenses
 
03:56:43.429 --> 03:56:43.439 align:start position:0%
into a sex trafficking operation
 
03:56:45.050 --> 03:56:45.060 align:start position:0%
I mean
 
03:56:45.060 --> 03:56:46.969 align:start position:0%
I mean
that's

03:56:46.969 --> 03:56:46.979 align:start position:0%
that's
 
03:56:49.189 --> 03:56:49.199 align:start position:0%
a very unsafe position to put those
 
03:56:50.330 --> 03:56:50.340 align:start position:0%
people into
 
03:56:52.370 --> 03:56:52.380 align:start position:0%
representative Dola
 
03:56:55.070 --> 03:56:55.080 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I'll be voting uh
 
03:56:57.530 --> 03:56:57.540 align:start position:0%
in favor of the itl
 
03:56:57.540 --> 03:56:58.370 align:start position:0%
in favor of the itl
um

03:56:58.370 --> 03:56:58.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:57:01.910 --> 03:57:01.920 align:start position:0%
but I'm uh I am concerned that this that
 
03:57:03.950 --> 03:57:03.960 align:start position:0%
the state is not doing enough to stop
 
03:57:06.710 --> 03:57:06.720 align:start position:0%
human trafficking
 
03:57:09.349 --> 03:57:09.359 align:start position:0%
okay thank you other comments
 
03:57:11.570 --> 03:57:11.580 align:start position:0%
representative Bailey
 
03:57:13.610 --> 03:57:13.620 align:start position:0%
I I think there's been some kind of
 
03:57:16.130 --> 03:57:16.140 align:start position:0%
mistake I mean this is not a licensing
 
03:57:17.750 --> 03:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
function this is some kind of law
 
03:57:19.610 --> 03:57:19.620 align:start position:0%
enforcement function and if you have any
 
03:57:21.290 --> 03:57:21.300 align:start position:0%
doubt of that there was a parade of
 
03:57:22.729 --> 03:57:22.739 align:start position:0%
police officers all the way up to
 
03:57:24.889 --> 03:57:24.899 align:start position:0%
Homeland Security testifying in favor of
 
03:57:28.550 --> 03:57:28.560 align:start position:0%
this and not a single masseuse or
 
03:57:32.570 --> 03:57:32.580 align:start position:0%
massage parlor and a proprietor or
 
03:57:32.580 --> 03:57:33.290 align:start position:0%
massage parlor and a proprietor or
um

03:57:33.290 --> 03:57:33.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:57:36.769 --> 03:57:36.779 align:start position:0%
with apologies to Sherlock Holmes it's
 
03:57:39.830 --> 03:57:39.840 align:start position:0%
not the function of Licensing to supply
 
03:57:43.550 --> 03:57:43.560 align:start position:0%
the deficiencies of the official police
 
03:57:48.710 --> 03:57:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:51.229 --> 03:57:51.239 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt
 
03:57:53.570 --> 03:57:53.580 align:start position:0%
well we're capitulating in in the face
 
03:57:57.910 --> 03:57:57.920 align:start position:0%
of uh a clear public nuisance a public
 
03:58:02.090 --> 03:58:02.100 align:start position:0%
anti-safety situation uh when we had
 
03:58:05.929 --> 03:58:05.939 align:start position:0%
people from uh one of the towns that
 
03:58:08.809 --> 03:58:08.819 align:start position:0%
indicated uh that they were having a
 
03:58:11.570 --> 03:58:11.580 align:start position:0%
major problem with this and there's
 
03:58:13.849 --> 03:58:13.859 align:start position:0%
something like 35 or 40 of these
 
03:58:16.729 --> 03:58:16.739 align:start position:0%
establishments uh so if you're going to
 
03:58:18.889 --> 03:58:18.899 align:start position:0%
talk about law enforcement the reality
 
03:58:22.790 --> 03:58:22.800 align:start position:0%
is it's only a misdemeanor uh and so
 
03:58:25.370 --> 03:58:25.380 align:start position:0%
it's it really isn't worth the police's
 
03:58:29.809 --> 03:58:29.819 align:start position:0%
time to bounce somebody who can they get
 
03:58:33.290 --> 03:58:33.300 align:start position:0%
their uh fine paid they get shipped out
 
03:58:35.330 --> 03:58:35.340 align:start position:0%
of town they get replaced immediately
 
03:58:37.670 --> 03:58:37.680 align:start position:0%
the operation goes on and the police
 
03:58:40.010 --> 03:58:40.020 align:start position:0%
feel completely frustrated and their
 
03:58:43.070 --> 03:58:43.080 align:start position:0%
inability to have a positive impact on
 
03:58:46.429 --> 03:58:46.439 align:start position:0%
this uh and so to the degree that the
 
03:58:48.290 --> 03:58:48.300 align:start position:0%
legitimate therapeutic massage
 
03:58:48.300 --> 03:58:49.410 align:start position:0%
legitimate therapeutic massage
practitioners

03:58:49.410 --> 03:58:49.420 align:start position:0%
practitioners
 
03:58:49.420 --> 03:58:51.309 align:start position:0%
practitioners
[Music]

03:58:51.309 --> 03:58:51.319 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:58:54.229 --> 03:58:54.239 align:start position:0%
are in some cases even being conflated
 
03:58:58.309 --> 03:58:58.319 align:start position:0%
with these illegal sex traffickers is is
 
03:59:03.050 --> 03:59:03.060 align:start position:0%
something that uh was was used to uh in
 
03:59:06.950 --> 03:59:06.960 align:start position:0%
my opinion uh improperly influence the
 
03:59:09.290 --> 03:59:09.300 align:start position:0%
people we heard from a very small number
 
03:59:11.750 --> 03:59:11.760 align:start position:0%
of people by the way the practitioners
 
03:59:11.760 --> 03:59:13.490 align:start position:0%
of people by the way the practitioners
so

03:59:13.490 --> 03:59:13.500 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:59:13.500 --> 03:59:14.349 align:start position:0%
so
um

03:59:14.349 --> 03:59:14.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:59:18.290 --> 03:59:18.300 align:start position:0%
if we are going to do nothing then we
 
03:59:19.910 --> 03:59:19.920 align:start position:0%
might as well go home but I ain't going
 
03:59:22.010 --> 03:59:22.020 align:start position:0%
home I'm voting against this and I'm
 
03:59:24.410 --> 03:59:24.420 align:start position:0%
going to continue to try to get us to do
 
03:59:27.110 --> 03:59:27.120 align:start position:0%
something responsible to for the
 
03:59:29.330 --> 03:59:29.340 align:start position:0%
communities that are being plagued
 
03:59:31.450 --> 03:59:31.460 align:start position:0%
Dairy four or five of these places
 
03:59:34.130 --> 03:59:34.140 align:start position:0%
Merrimack four or five of these places
 
03:59:36.830 --> 03:59:36.840 align:start position:0%
for a total of about 40 in the state of
 
03:59:38.630 --> 03:59:38.640 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and we are doing nothing
 
03:59:41.210 --> 03:59:41.220 align:start position:0%
but we could be doing something
 
03:59:44.150 --> 03:59:44.160 align:start position:0%
perhaps we should be making it more than
 
03:59:45.950 --> 03:59:45.960 align:start position:0%
just a misdemeanor so that the local
 
03:59:49.790 --> 03:59:49.800 align:start position:0%
police are incentivized to take stronger
 
03:59:52.370 --> 03:59:52.380 align:start position:0%
action would representative Gould and
 
03:59:53.630 --> 03:59:53.640 align:start position:0%
then Simon
 
03:59:56.929 --> 03:59:56.939 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I
 
03:59:59.689 --> 03:59:59.699 align:start position:0%
I don't see this I mean I hear the
 
04:00:02.290 --> 04:00:02.300 align:start position:0%
testimony breaking down on the
 
04:00:05.750 --> 04:00:05.760 align:start position:0%
bipartisan lines and for me it's very
 
04:00:07.729 --> 04:00:07.739 align:start position:0%
important to take a look at who it is
 
04:00:10.490 --> 04:00:10.500 align:start position:0%
the policy should be helping
 
04:00:14.389 --> 04:00:14.399 align:start position:0%
and I did not hear from
 
04:00:17.570 --> 04:00:17.580 align:start position:0%
hardly the few massage par power
 
04:00:20.990 --> 04:00:21.000 align:start position:0%
therapists I heard from were opposed to
 
04:00:23.210 --> 04:00:23.220 align:start position:0%
it and so
 
04:00:23.220 --> 04:00:25.250 align:start position:0%
it and so
um

04:00:25.250 --> 04:00:25.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:00:27.650 --> 04:00:27.660 align:start position:0%
though it may be very unpopular I am
 
04:00:31.250 --> 04:00:31.260 align:start position:0%
going about to support the Ito
 
04:00:33.830 --> 04:00:33.840 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Simon thank you
 
04:00:36.469 --> 04:00:36.479 align:start position:0%
madam chair I would just like to say I
 
04:00:37.849 --> 04:00:37.859 align:start position:0%
don't think that this is an issue of us
 
04:00:37.859 --> 04:00:39.349 align:start position:0%
don't think that this is an issue of us
capitulating

04:00:39.349 --> 04:00:39.359 align:start position:0%
capitulating
 
04:00:39.359 --> 04:00:40.429 align:start position:0%
capitulating
um

04:00:40.429 --> 04:00:40.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:00:43.189 --> 04:00:43.199 align:start position:0%
I hate human trafficking I hate sexual
 
04:00:45.650 --> 04:00:45.660 align:start position:0%
human trafficking I am more than happy
 
04:00:49.670 --> 04:00:49.680 align:start position:0%
to fight on every reasonable front to to
 
04:00:52.189 --> 04:00:52.199 align:start position:0%
stop that practice from happening but I
 
04:00:53.630 --> 04:00:53.640 align:start position:0%
think we should be honest about what
 
04:00:57.229 --> 04:00:57.239 align:start position:0%
we're doing and oplc has a lot of
 
04:00:59.469 --> 04:00:59.479 align:start position:0%
inspectors in a lot of different areas
 
04:01:02.689 --> 04:01:02.699 align:start position:0%
they go in to make their inspections
 
04:01:05.269 --> 04:01:05.279 align:start position:0%
for a reason and a purpose and that is
 
04:01:09.290 --> 04:01:09.300 align:start position:0%
so that the public is safe specifically
 
04:01:10.610 --> 04:01:10.620 align:start position:0%
regarding the service that they're
 
04:01:13.309 --> 04:01:13.319 align:start position:0%
providing and I don't really want
 
04:01:13.319 --> 04:01:14.110 align:start position:0%
providing and I don't really want
um

04:01:14.110 --> 04:01:14.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:01:16.610 --> 04:01:16.620 align:start position:0%
oplc investigators coming into my
 
04:01:20.570 --> 04:01:20.580 align:start position:0%
business as a as a convenience store
 
04:01:23.990 --> 04:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
Deli looking for money laundering
 
04:01:25.550 --> 04:01:25.560 align:start position:0%
um I feel like that that is a Law
 
04:01:28.729 --> 04:01:28.739 align:start position:0%
Enforcement issue I don't think oplc is
 
04:01:31.670 --> 04:01:31.680 align:start position:0%
uh because they're not law enforcement I
 
04:01:33.110 --> 04:01:33.120 align:start position:0%
don't think they're in a position to do
 
04:01:35.630 --> 04:01:35.640 align:start position:0%
that safely that is not their area of
 
04:01:38.929 --> 04:01:38.939 align:start position:0%
expertise if we can come up with another
 
04:01:41.450 --> 04:01:41.460 align:start position:0%
solution to this that that does go
 
04:01:42.710 --> 04:01:42.720 align:start position:0%
primarily in the law enforcement
 
04:01:45.349 --> 04:01:45.359 align:start position:0%
Direction Mr meaner in my opinion is
 
04:01:48.410 --> 04:01:48.420 align:start position:0%
ridiculous and that needs to be adjusted
 
04:01:50.150 --> 04:01:50.160 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to work on that I'd be happy
 
04:01:52.010 --> 04:01:52.020 align:start position:0%
to to um
 
04:01:53.809 --> 04:01:53.819 align:start position:0%
be a prime sponsor on a bill like that
 
04:01:57.349 --> 04:01:57.359 align:start position:0%
but I think that this approach is
 
04:01:57.359 --> 04:01:58.910 align:start position:0%
but I think that this approach is
dishonest

04:01:58.910 --> 04:01:58.920 align:start position:0%
dishonest
 
04:02:00.590 --> 04:02:00.600 align:start position:0%
um I think it muddies the water too much
 
04:02:03.170 --> 04:02:03.180 align:start position:0%
and I think it puts people at risk that
 
04:02:05.269 --> 04:02:05.279 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be at risk and in order to
 
04:02:10.370 --> 04:02:10.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:12.950 --> 04:02:12.960 align:start position:0%
there's no dishonesty in this bill and
 
04:02:15.410 --> 04:02:15.420 align:start position:0%
there's no dishonest intent
 
04:02:18.170 --> 04:02:18.180 align:start position:0%
and I am offended by that
 
04:02:21.050 --> 04:02:21.060 align:start position:0%
this bill is a licensing bill for Public
 
04:02:24.710 --> 04:02:24.720 align:start position:0%
Safety and it allows the inspection of
 
04:02:27.530 --> 04:02:27.540 align:start position:0%
massage establishments just like we
 
04:02:30.790 --> 04:02:30.800 align:start position:0%
allow inspections of hairdressers
 
04:02:34.910 --> 04:02:34.920 align:start position:0%
cosmetologists estheticians anybody who
 
04:02:37.969 --> 04:02:37.979 align:start position:0%
is serving the public so please let's
 
04:02:40.370 --> 04:02:40.380 align:start position:0%
stick to the subject
 
04:02:43.010 --> 04:02:43.020 align:start position:0%
yes thank you thank you representative
 
04:02:45.830 --> 04:02:45.840 align:start position:0%
Broda we you can't know why someone is
 
04:02:47.809 --> 04:02:47.819 align:start position:0%
doing something and it is
 
04:02:49.910 --> 04:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
thoroughly improper to attack their
 
04:02:49.920 --> 04:02:50.990 align:start position:0%
thoroughly improper to attack their
motives

04:02:50.990 --> 04:02:51.000 align:start position:0%
motives
 
04:02:54.050 --> 04:02:54.060 align:start position:0%
the effects yes but not their motives
 
04:02:54.060 --> 04:02:55.790 align:start position:0%
the effects yes but not their motives
so

04:02:55.790 --> 04:02:55.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:02:57.830 --> 04:02:57.840 align:start position:0%
if I may I had no intention of doing
 
04:02:59.269 --> 04:02:59.279 align:start position:0%
that and I didn't even realize that I
 
04:03:02.030 --> 04:03:02.040 align:start position:0%
had so I sincerely apologize that's not
 
04:03:03.110 --> 04:03:03.120 align:start position:0%
the way that I meant for her to come
 
04:03:06.469 --> 04:03:06.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:09.830 --> 04:03:09.840 align:start position:0%
thank you any other comments questions
 
04:03:12.170 --> 04:03:12.180 align:start position:0%
yes representative Gould
 
04:03:13.910 --> 04:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
I just want to follow up that I really
 
04:03:16.189 --> 04:03:16.199 align:start position:0%
appreciate the intent of Representative
 
04:03:18.170 --> 04:03:18.180 align:start position:0%
Grody on this bill and others that
 
04:03:20.389 --> 04:03:20.399 align:start position:0%
worked really really hard on it and
 
04:03:22.969 --> 04:03:22.979 align:start position:0%
um and I support a hundred percent that
 
04:03:25.010 --> 04:03:25.020 align:start position:0%
the bill got
 
04:03:25.020 --> 04:03:26.450 align:start position:0%
the bill got
um

04:03:26.450 --> 04:03:26.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:03:29.150 --> 04:03:29.160 align:start position:0%
hijacked by this whole sex trafficking
 
04:03:31.490 --> 04:03:31.500 align:start position:0%
and what I found particularly offensive
 
04:03:34.070 --> 04:03:34.080 align:start position:0%
was the whole issue became focused on
 
04:03:37.429 --> 04:03:37.439 align:start position:0%
one minority group and we know that who
 
04:03:39.889 --> 04:03:39.899 align:start position:0%
work in the field that the problem is
 
04:03:42.830 --> 04:03:42.840 align:start position:0%
much bigger so I support representative
 
04:03:44.929 --> 04:03:44.939 align:start position:0%
grody's efforts but
 
04:03:47.030 --> 04:03:47.040 align:start position:0%
the way the bill got presented in the
 
04:03:48.950 --> 04:03:48.960 align:start position:0%
hearing I cannot support it
 
04:03:51.950 --> 04:03:51.960 align:start position:0%
thank you anyone else
 
04:03:51.960 --> 04:03:53.929 align:start position:0%

uh representative Broda do you wish to
 
04:05:07.189 --> 04:05:07.199 align:start position:0%

[Music]

04:05:25.910 --> 04:05:25.920 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:05:30.050 --> 04:05:30.060 align:start position:0%
House Bill 620 representative is sure
 
04:05:32.410 --> 04:05:32.420 align:start position:0%
why you had a motion
 
04:05:35.269 --> 04:05:35.279 align:start position:0%
representative has a motion yes
 
04:05:40.130 --> 04:05:40.140 align:start position:0%
um to move uh itl on hb620
 
04:05:46.550 --> 04:05:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:46.560 --> 04:05:47.929 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:05:47.929 --> 04:05:47.939 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:05:50.630 --> 04:05:50.640 align:start position:0%
do you wish to speak to your motion I do
 
04:05:53.570 --> 04:05:53.580 align:start position:0%
um first of all from the the Edna point
 
04:05:55.849 --> 04:05:55.859 align:start position:0%
of view I think um
 
04:05:58.969 --> 04:05:58.979 align:start position:0%
the idea of standing up a whole separate
 
04:06:01.969 --> 04:06:01.979 align:start position:0%
department for the purpose of a
 
04:06:05.330 --> 04:06:05.340 align:start position:0%
basically a pilot program is a very
 
04:06:07.849 --> 04:06:07.859 align:start position:0%
strange odd and inappropriate one
 
04:06:09.410 --> 04:06:09.420 align:start position:0%
and I've heard there's some discussion
 
04:06:11.150 --> 04:06:11.160 align:start position:0%
about maybe
 
04:06:13.370 --> 04:06:13.380 align:start position:0%
amending it to change that maybe put it
 
04:06:15.650 --> 04:06:15.660 align:start position:0%
into the doe or somewhere else and my
 
04:06:18.349 --> 04:06:18.359 align:start position:0%
issue with that is
 
04:06:19.910 --> 04:06:19.920 align:start position:0%
I mean the question or whether or not
 
04:06:21.530 --> 04:06:21.540 align:start position:0%
that's a good idea
 
04:06:23.570 --> 04:06:23.580 align:start position:0%
is not one that I think is appropriate
 
04:06:25.309 --> 04:06:25.319 align:start position:0%
for Edna I mean that's an education
 
04:06:25.319 --> 04:06:26.570 align:start position:0%
for Edna I mean that's an education
question

04:06:26.570 --> 04:06:26.580 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:06:28.490 --> 04:06:28.500 align:start position:0%
and that should go to that committee and
 
04:06:29.990 --> 04:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
if people want to do that they could
 
04:06:31.550 --> 04:06:31.560 align:start position:0%
there could be a bill
 
04:06:33.229 --> 04:06:33.239 align:start position:0%
that would address that separately
 
04:06:34.670 --> 04:06:34.680 align:start position:0%
without trying to stand up a whole
 
04:06:36.469 --> 04:06:36.479 align:start position:0%
department just for that
 
04:06:39.530 --> 04:06:39.540 align:start position:0%
and uh on a somewhat not serious note I
 
04:06:41.929 --> 04:06:41.939 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want to step on my wife's uh
 
04:06:45.590 --> 04:06:45.600 align:start position:0%
uh feet or toes on taking over education
 
04:06:45.600 --> 04:06:47.150 align:start position:0%
uh feet or toes on taking over education
bills

04:06:47.150 --> 04:06:47.160 align:start position:0%
bills
 
04:06:49.849 --> 04:06:49.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:51.830 --> 04:06:51.840 align:start position:0%
representative Sasser do you wish to
 
04:06:53.150 --> 04:06:53.160 align:start position:0%
speak to your second
 
04:06:55.189 --> 04:06:55.199 align:start position:0%
uh I concur with uh Tony Lucas's
 
04:06:57.950 --> 04:06:57.960 align:start position:0%
comments okay
 
04:07:01.189 --> 04:07:01.199 align:start position:0%
representative Broda
 
04:07:03.110 --> 04:07:03.120 align:start position:0%
thank you so there was a subcommittee
 
04:07:05.450 --> 04:07:05.460 align:start position:0%
meeting on House Bill 620
 
04:07:07.849 --> 04:07:07.859 align:start position:0%
and the Department of Education attended
 
04:07:09.530 --> 04:07:09.540 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee meeting
 
04:07:12.650 --> 04:07:12.660 align:start position:0%
and there were three subcommittee
 
04:07:15.650 --> 04:07:15.660 align:start position:0%
members there myself
 
04:07:17.450 --> 04:07:17.460 align:start position:0%
representative Wilhelm and Mr
 
04:07:19.969 --> 04:07:19.979 align:start position:0%
representative Center nastazo
 
04:07:22.910 --> 04:07:22.920 align:start position:0%
and a an amendment was discussed because
 
04:07:25.370 --> 04:07:25.380 align:start position:0%
the department of education does want
 
04:07:28.070 --> 04:07:28.080 align:start position:0%
this under their jurisdiction
 
04:07:30.769 --> 04:07:30.779 align:start position:0%
and the amendment was written so that
 
04:07:30.779 --> 04:07:32.330 align:start position:0%
and the amendment was written so that
the

04:07:32.330 --> 04:07:32.340 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:07:35.090 --> 04:07:35.100 align:start position:0%
Department of Education would have it
 
04:07:37.969 --> 04:07:37.979 align:start position:0%
would establish a division not have a
 
04:07:40.610 --> 04:07:40.620 align:start position:0%
separate Department therefore
 
04:07:42.950 --> 04:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
I would encourage the committee we can
 
04:07:45.110 --> 04:07:45.120 align:start position:0%
do two things we can continue obviously
 
04:07:47.030 --> 04:07:47.040 align:start position:0%
on the vote but I also would like to
 
04:07:49.910 --> 04:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
suggest that the subcommittee which did
 
04:07:52.370 --> 04:07:52.380 align:start position:0%
not look at this
 
04:07:52.380 --> 04:07:54.189 align:start position:0%
not look at this
um

04:07:54.189 --> 04:07:54.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:07:57.950 --> 04:07:57.960 align:start position:0%
Amendment and you can meet again with
 
04:07:59.929 --> 04:07:59.939 align:start position:0%
all its members present
 
04:08:03.950 --> 04:08:03.960 align:start position:0%
could take a look at it and comment on
 
04:08:05.809 --> 04:08:05.819 align:start position:0%
the sub on the amendment to the
 
04:08:07.670 --> 04:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
committee thank you but I will not
 
04:08:10.070 --> 04:08:10.080 align:start position:0%
support an itl motion
 
04:08:12.410 --> 04:08:12.420 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:08:17.809 --> 04:08:17.819 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:21.110 --> 04:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
I I'd like to say myself that I attended
 
04:08:24.170 --> 04:08:24.180 align:start position:0%
part of that subcommittee meeting and
 
04:08:27.290 --> 04:08:27.300 align:start position:0%
it seemed to me that the department
 
04:08:29.689 --> 04:08:29.699 align:start position:0%
that there wasn't much of a need for a
 
04:08:29.699 --> 04:08:30.550 align:start position:0%
that there wasn't much of a need for a
bill

04:08:30.550 --> 04:08:30.560 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:08:34.790 --> 04:08:34.800 align:start position:0%
the at the 10 at the hearing the Depo
 
04:08:37.389 --> 04:08:37.399 align:start position:0%
the board of education for Manchester
 
04:08:41.030 --> 04:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
spoke in favor of this but they already
 
04:08:43.370 --> 04:08:43.380 align:start position:0%
have a
 
04:08:46.309 --> 04:08:46.319 align:start position:0%
pilot program very similar as far as I
 
04:08:47.870 --> 04:08:47.880 align:start position:0%
could tell to what this bill would
 
04:08:47.880 --> 04:08:49.429 align:start position:0%
could tell to what this bill would
create

04:08:49.429 --> 04:08:49.439 align:start position:0%
create
 
04:08:51.950 --> 04:08:51.960 align:start position:0%
and so I don't see the need for us to
 
04:08:54.969 --> 04:08:54.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:58.309 --> 04:08:58.319 align:start position:0%
and I'm also very much against forming a
 
04:09:00.349 --> 04:09:00.359 align:start position:0%
new division or a department
 
04:09:03.650 --> 04:09:03.660 align:start position:0%
for something that I'm not convinced is
 
04:09:06.830 --> 04:09:06.840 align:start position:0%
actually a state responsibility
 
04:09:08.990 --> 04:09:09.000 align:start position:0%
so that's my position
 
04:09:12.830 --> 04:09:12.840 align:start position:0%
representing a bear and then Groton
 
04:09:14.570 --> 04:09:14.580 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
04:09:16.330 --> 04:09:16.340 align:start position:0%
I will be
 
04:09:20.330 --> 04:09:20.340 align:start position:0%
I will be supporting itl against HB 620
 
04:09:20.340 --> 04:09:21.889 align:start position:0%
I will be supporting itl against HB 620
FN

04:09:21.889 --> 04:09:21.899 align:start position:0%
FN
 
04:09:25.729 --> 04:09:25.739 align:start position:0%
for the one fact that during testimony
 
04:09:29.090 --> 04:09:29.100 align:start position:0%
what we heard is arpa funds were used to
 
04:09:33.950 --> 04:09:33.960 align:start position:0%
establish this pilot in Manchester and
 
04:09:36.469 --> 04:09:36.479 align:start position:0%
I ran on Lower taxes
 
04:09:39.050 --> 04:09:39.060 align:start position:0%
and don't believe that anything used
 
04:09:42.650 --> 04:09:42.660 align:start position:0%
with anything with any arpa fund should
 
04:09:49.750 --> 04:09:49.760 align:start position:0%
be a one-time thing and done and this is
 
04:09:54.410 --> 04:09:54.420 align:start position:0%
growth of the education department so I
 
04:09:59.510 --> 04:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:59.520 --> 04:10:02.090 align:start position:0%
 
representative

04:10:02.090 --> 04:10:02.100 align:start position:0%

04:12:05.269 --> 04:12:05.279 align:start position:0%
so the amendment creates a division this
 
04:12:07.010 --> 04:12:07.020 align:start position:0%
was this amendment was written in
 
04:12:09.650 --> 04:12:09.660 align:start position:0%
conjunction with um the representative
 
04:12:11.389 --> 04:12:11.399 align:start position:0%
from the Department of Education during
 
04:12:12.950 --> 04:12:12.960 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee meeting
 
04:12:15.590 --> 04:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
and um representative Heath the bill
 
04:12:17.389 --> 04:12:17.399 align:start position:0%
sponsor was also there
 
04:12:20.389 --> 04:12:20.399 align:start position:0%
and this bill creates a division of
 
04:12:22.010 --> 04:12:22.020 align:start position:0%
Early Education in the Department of
 
04:12:24.410 --> 04:12:24.420 align:start position:0%
Education and it's whether or not we all
 
04:12:26.570 --> 04:12:26.580 align:start position:0%
believe we all think of when education
 
04:12:29.450 --> 04:12:29.460 align:start position:0%
starts there's a start Pre-K or does
 
04:12:30.950 --> 04:12:30.960 align:start position:0%
occur we're in kindergarten to start
 
04:12:33.229 --> 04:12:33.239 align:start position:0%
when you're in first grade when did you
 
04:12:35.389 --> 04:12:35.399 align:start position:0%
think children
 
04:12:35.399 --> 04:12:36.110 align:start position:0%
think children
um

04:12:36.110 --> 04:12:36.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:12:38.570 --> 04:12:38.580 align:start position:0%
should be begin their their formal
 
04:12:38.580 --> 04:12:40.189 align:start position:0%
should be begin their their formal
education

04:12:40.189 --> 04:12:40.199 align:start position:0%
education
 
04:12:43.370 --> 04:12:43.380 align:start position:0%
um the um it's a pilot program so it's
 
04:12:45.469 --> 04:12:45.479 align:start position:0%
not something that
 
04:12:49.250 --> 04:12:49.260 align:start position:0%
um it does have a um restrictions on
 
04:12:51.610 --> 04:12:51.620 align:start position:0%
that and it does give the financial
 
04:12:54.349 --> 04:12:54.359 align:start position:0%
responsibility for the program to the
 
04:12:56.269 --> 04:12:56.279 align:start position:0%
Department of Education so they're the
 
04:12:58.189 --> 04:12:58.199 align:start position:0%
ones that will decide how to fund it and
 
04:13:00.830 --> 04:13:00.840 align:start position:0%
how to implement it it gives them the
 
04:13:03.290 --> 04:13:03.300 align:start position:0%
authority to do so so what we're saying
 
04:13:05.870 --> 04:13:05.880 align:start position:0%
is that we're going to amend the bill so
 
04:13:08.450 --> 04:13:08.460 align:start position:0%
that it gives the responsibility of
 
04:13:10.189 --> 04:13:10.199 align:start position:0%
creating this pilot program to the
 
04:13:12.590 --> 04:13:12.600 align:start position:0%
Department of Education with their rules
 
04:13:14.269 --> 04:13:14.279 align:start position:0%
that they think should be applied to the
 
04:13:14.279 --> 04:13:16.550 align:start position:0%
that they think should be applied to the
program

04:13:16.550 --> 04:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:18.769 --> 04:13:18.779 align:start position:0%
thank you represent gold you wish to
 
04:13:20.269 --> 04:13:20.279 align:start position:0%
speak to your second
 
04:13:22.429 --> 04:13:22.439 align:start position:0%
no I think representative Grody said it
 
04:13:25.189 --> 04:13:25.199 align:start position:0%
all okay any comments representative
 
04:13:25.199 --> 04:13:27.050 align:start position:0%
all okay any comments representative
blackis

04:13:27.050 --> 04:13:27.060 align:start position:0%
blackis
 
04:13:29.510 --> 04:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
um an actual I'll answer the the good
 
04:13:31.550 --> 04:13:31.560 align:start position:0%
question that was posed which is I do
 
04:13:33.469 --> 04:13:33.479 align:start position:0%
not believe that formal education should
 
04:13:36.349 --> 04:13:36.359 align:start position:0%
start as early as Pre-K so on the policy
 
04:13:37.670 --> 04:13:37.680 align:start position:0%
point of view I don't agree with the
 
04:13:37.680 --> 04:13:39.110 align:start position:0%
point of view I don't agree with the
bill

04:13:39.110 --> 04:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:13:40.550 --> 04:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
I'd like to say something yes
 
04:13:40.560 --> 04:13:41.750 align:start position:0%
I'd like to say something yes
representative

04:13:41.750 --> 04:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:13:44.450 --> 04:13:44.460 align:start position:0%
so here's my stance on this um I would
 
04:13:47.570 --> 04:13:47.580 align:start position:0%
never support this bill whatsoever until
 
04:13:49.309 --> 04:13:49.319 align:start position:0%
we could actually get a handle on the
 
04:13:50.809 --> 04:13:50.819 align:start position:0%
indoctrination that's going on in our
 
04:13:52.189 --> 04:13:52.199 align:start position:0%
schools and it is going on in our
 
04:13:53.570 --> 04:13:53.580 align:start position:0%
schools because I've been speaking with
 
04:13:55.610 --> 04:13:55.620 align:start position:0%
the teachers and the parents and they
 
04:13:57.650 --> 04:13:57.660 align:start position:0%
all agree that this is getting out of
 
04:13:59.330 --> 04:13:59.340 align:start position:0%
control so until we could get a handle
 
04:14:01.370 --> 04:14:01.380 align:start position:0%
on that I would never Vote for This Bill
 
04:14:05.450 --> 04:14:05.460 align:start position:0%
thank you okay other representative care
 
04:14:05.460 --> 04:14:06.530 align:start position:0%
thank you okay other representative care
heart

04:14:06.530 --> 04:14:06.540 align:start position:0%
heart
 
04:14:08.330 --> 04:14:08.340 align:start position:0%
I would just say that in general
 
04:14:09.590 --> 04:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
from what I've seen at least in my
 
04:14:11.389 --> 04:14:11.399 align:start position:0%
district the public school the the
 
04:14:13.729 --> 04:14:13.739 align:start position:0%
proficiency rates are just really really
 
04:14:15.349 --> 04:14:15.359 align:start position:0%
bad and I just don't think adding more
 
04:14:16.969 --> 04:14:16.979 align:start position:0%
to their plate at this time is the right
 
04:14:18.889 --> 04:14:18.899 align:start position:0%
way to go
 
04:14:21.410 --> 04:14:21.420 align:start position:0%
thank you anyone else
 
04:14:24.050 --> 04:14:24.060 align:start position:0%
Jefferson Bieber
 
04:14:26.630 --> 04:14:26.640 align:start position:0%
just one more comment
 
04:14:29.410 --> 04:14:29.420 align:start position:0%
during testimony it was made clear that
 
04:14:32.150 --> 04:14:32.160 align:start position:0%
the parents
 
04:14:36.410 --> 04:14:36.420 align:start position:0%
would be involved in these three and
 
04:14:39.590 --> 04:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
four-year-olds three years old sitting
 
04:14:42.950 --> 04:14:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:45.050 --> 04:14:45.060 align:start position:0%
um trying to learn I think that we've
 
04:14:47.929 --> 04:14:47.939 align:start position:0%
all heard how what a disaster
 
04:14:51.050 --> 04:14:51.060 align:start position:0%
remote learning during covid was so
 
04:14:54.110 --> 04:14:54.120 align:start position:0%
that's also why I will vote ITF thank
 
04:14:55.610 --> 04:14:55.620 align:start position:0%
you madam
 
04:14:57.410 --> 04:14:57.420 align:start position:0%
represent Dolan
 
04:15:00.530 --> 04:15:00.540 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair my calling raised
 
04:15:03.590 --> 04:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
a key point that concerns me that if the
 
04:15:06.410 --> 04:15:06.420 align:start position:0%
if the availability of funds for this
 
04:15:10.090 --> 04:15:10.100 align:start position:0%
program was a one-time uh
 
04:15:14.090 --> 04:15:14.100 align:start position:0%
insertion into the uh into the budget
 
04:15:17.330 --> 04:15:17.340 align:start position:0%
uh yet this bill would make the
 
04:15:19.130 --> 04:15:19.140 align:start position:0%
expenditure of those funds a permanent
 
04:15:22.490 --> 04:15:22.500 align:start position:0%
recurring event uh to me that's a
 
04:15:25.010 --> 04:15:25.020 align:start position:0%
disconnect that's uh
 
04:15:28.429 --> 04:15:28.439 align:start position:0%
hits it under the funding side and quite
 
04:15:32.150 --> 04:15:32.160 align:start position:0%
frankly could be a violation of uh of
 
04:15:34.429 --> 04:15:34.439 align:start position:0%
our constitution as an unspunded mandate
 
04:15:37.130 --> 04:15:37.140 align:start position:0%

I'm going to vote Yes because I think
 
04:17:44.950 --> 04:17:44.960 align:start position:0%
the amendment improves the bill
 
04:17:48.769 --> 04:17:48.779 align:start position:0%
drastically okay I stand corrected

04:17:56.809 --> 04:17:56.819 align:start position:0%
emotion represent the uh representative
 
04:18:00.410 --> 04:18:00.420 align:start position:0%
crota yes I have a motion of otter pass
 
04:18:03.170 --> 04:18:03.180 align:start position:0%
with Amendment otpa on House Bill 620
 
04:18:05.889 --> 04:18:05.899 align:start position:0%
with Amendment
 
04:18:09.349 --> 04:18:09.359 align:start position:0%
376. is there a second
 
04:18:09.359 --> 04:18:11.330 align:start position:0%
376. is there a second
second

04:18:11.330 --> 04:18:11.340 align:start position:0%

04:18:25.189 --> 04:18:25.199 align:start position:0%
I will say that I voted in favor of the
 
04:18:27.290 --> 04:18:27.300 align:start position:0%
amendment because it eliminates
 
04:18:30.050 --> 04:18:30.060 align:start position:0%
the department which I was strongly
 
04:18:31.429 --> 04:18:31.439 align:start position:0%
opposed to
 
04:18:33.290 --> 04:18:33.300 align:start position:0%
but I'm still going to vote against
 
04:18:34.849 --> 04:18:34.859 align:start position:0%
ought to pass with Amendment because I
 
04:18:36.290 --> 04:18:36.300 align:start position:0%
don't think
 
04:18:38.650 --> 04:18:38.660 align:start position:0%
we should be getting involved in pre-k
 
04:18:42.170 --> 04:18:42.180 align:start position:0%
education on as a government certainly
 
04:18:44.870 --> 04:18:44.880 align:start position:0%
not at the state level
 
04:18:47.330 --> 04:18:47.340 align:start position:0%
anywhere else
 
04:18:47.340 --> 04:18:48.650 align:start position:0%
anywhere else
okay

a little lighter
 
04:20:19.560 --> 04:20:21.050 align:start position:0%

04:20:33.530 --> 04:20:33.540 align:start position:0%
I'll spell 183. okay is there is a
 
04:20:35.929 --> 04:20:35.939 align:start position:0%
second okay second is by representative
 
04:20:37.670 --> 04:20:37.680 align:start position:0%
Simon do you wish to speak to your
 
04:20:37.680 --> 04:20:38.809 align:start position:0%
Simon do you wish to speak to your
motion

04:20:38.809 --> 04:20:38.819 align:start position:0%
motion
 
04:20:38.819 --> 04:20:41.870 align:start position:0%
motion
sure

04:20:41.870 --> 04:20:41.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:44.870 --> 04:20:44.880 align:start position:0%
I I think I mean we heard the breakdown
 
04:20:50.210 --> 04:20:50.220 align:start position:0%
was basically 75 25 on
 
04:20:52.370 --> 04:20:52.380 align:start position:0%
retired versus firefighters who are
 
04:20:55.670 --> 04:20:55.680 align:start position:0%
employed working at the Academy but
 
04:20:57.889 --> 04:20:57.899 align:start position:0%
um and watching the subcommittee and
 
04:20:59.809 --> 04:20:59.819 align:start position:0%
looking at the numbers coming out we
 
04:21:01.550 --> 04:21:01.560 align:start position:0%
couldn't get a real handle on the actual
 
04:21:04.670 --> 04:21:04.680 align:start position:0%
numbers of retired firefighters and how
 
04:21:06.530 --> 04:21:06.540 align:start position:0%
many of those that are retired working
 
04:21:09.229 --> 04:21:09.239 align:start position:0%
at the Academy would take advantage of
 
04:21:11.450 --> 04:21:11.460 align:start position:0%
increasing hours I think it would be
 
04:21:14.570 --> 04:21:14.580 align:start position:0%
helpful if we had exact numbers because
 
04:21:16.130 --> 04:21:16.140 align:start position:0%
if this is only going to benefit four or
 
04:21:19.309 --> 04:21:19.319 align:start position:0%
five individuals passing legislation for
 
04:21:21.590 --> 04:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
a small group of people I don't think is
 
04:21:23.330 --> 04:21:23.340 align:start position:0%
necessary and I think until we have
 
04:21:25.490 --> 04:21:25.500 align:start position:0%
those actual numbers that we can work
 
04:21:28.010 --> 04:21:28.020 align:start position:0%
off of to see if this would work to get
 
04:21:30.410 --> 04:21:30.420 align:start position:0%
more people working over at the Academy
 
04:21:33.050 --> 04:21:33.060 align:start position:0%
or not we need those Baseline and so
 
04:21:36.410 --> 04:21:36.420 align:start position:0%
until we get that moving retain we okay
 
04:21:38.210 --> 04:21:38.220 align:start position:0%
representative Simon thank you madam
 
04:21:41.030 --> 04:21:41.040 align:start position:0%
chair there were a number of unanswered
 
04:21:42.590 --> 04:21:42.600 align:start position:0%
questions and a lot of information that
 
04:21:44.210 --> 04:21:44.220 align:start position:0%
we didn't have
 
04:21:44.220 --> 04:21:44.929 align:start position:0%
we didn't have
um

04:21:44.929 --> 04:21:44.939 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:21:46.670 --> 04:21:46.680 align:start position:0%
if we were to pass this piece of
 
04:21:48.469 --> 04:21:48.479 align:start position:0%
legislation right now it has the
 
04:21:49.910 --> 04:21:49.920 align:start position:0%
potential to affect
 
04:21:49.920 --> 04:21:50.630 align:start position:0%
potential to affect
um

04:21:50.630 --> 04:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:21:52.610 --> 04:21:52.620 align:start position:0%
other other groups as well who may want
 
04:21:54.769 --> 04:21:54.779 align:start position:0%
to do the same thing and I would like to
 
04:21:56.570 --> 04:21:56.580 align:start position:0%
have a better handle on what the
 
04:21:59.330 --> 04:21:59.340 align:start position:0%
ramifications of that would be I also
 
04:22:00.410 --> 04:22:00.420 align:start position:0%
don't want to just kill it because I
 
04:22:01.729 --> 04:22:01.739 align:start position:0%
think it has Meriden it's something that
 
04:22:03.650 --> 04:22:03.660 align:start position:0%
we need to be concerned about so we'd
 
04:22:15.349 --> 04:22:15.359 align:start position:0%

04:24:08.630 --> 04:24:08.640 align:start position:0%
this was at the request of
 
04:24:12.229 --> 04:24:12.239 align:start position:0%
the retirement system some of them were
 
04:24:13.849 --> 04:24:13.859 align:start position:0%
where there were conflicting areas in
 
04:24:15.950 --> 04:24:15.960 align:start position:0%
the statute um
 
04:24:18.650 --> 04:24:18.660 align:start position:0%
there was a change in the name of one of
 
04:24:21.710 --> 04:24:21.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:23.330 --> 04:24:23.340 align:start position:0%
you know the standards boards that
 
04:24:25.010 --> 04:24:25.020 align:start position:0%
they're required to adhere to and that
 
04:24:27.110 --> 04:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
had to require changes in here the
 
04:24:28.969 --> 04:24:28.979 align:start position:0%
amendment has to do with teacher job
 
04:24:31.130 --> 04:24:31.140 align:start position:0%
share and um
 
04:24:33.170 --> 04:24:33.180 align:start position:0%
I guess for teachers there are
 
04:24:35.990 --> 04:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
situations where two of them share
 
04:24:40.550 --> 04:24:40.560 align:start position:0%
a job and that was not um
 
04:24:42.590 --> 04:24:42.600 align:start position:0%
and and it's and the other then
 
04:24:44.870 --> 04:24:44.880 align:start position:0%
originally the bill allowed for that but
 
04:24:47.150 --> 04:24:47.160 align:start position:0%
only if they were on different days
 
04:24:49.309 --> 04:24:49.319 align:start position:0%
and it turns out that some of them will
 
04:24:50.630 --> 04:24:50.640 align:start position:0%
do the morning some of the afternoon
 
04:24:53.389 --> 04:24:53.399 align:start position:0%
still split days and then there was a
 
04:24:55.010 --> 04:24:55.020 align:start position:0%
further redo the amendment that they're
 
04:24:56.330 --> 04:24:56.340 align:start position:0%
not always
 
04:25:00.650 --> 04:25:00.660 align:start position:0%
um 50 50. so the amendment allows
 
04:25:03.950 --> 04:25:03.960 align:start position:0%
um a little more variance than that and
 
04:25:06.650 --> 04:25:06.660 align:start position:0%
it's uh the amendment is is okayed by
 
04:25:08.510 --> 04:25:08.520 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
04:25:10.429 --> 04:25:10.439 align:start position:0%
by the retirement system I was actually
 
04:25:14.090 --> 04:25:14.100 align:start position:0%
at the request of the teachers union so
 
04:25:14.100 --> 04:25:17.990 align:start position:0%
at the request of the teachers union so
okay

04:25:17.990 --> 04:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:21.650 --> 04:25:21.660 align:start position:0%
no I think it was explained very well
 
04:25:27.530 --> 04:25:27.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:30.490 --> 04:25:30.500 align:start position:0%

Susie
 
04:27:46.910 --> 04:27:46.920 align:start position:0%
and the chair yes 20 years uh Madam
 
04:27:49.490 --> 04:27:49.500 align:start position:0%
chair I appear I may be a good speaker
 
04:27:51.830 --> 04:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
but I'm not as organized I should be I
 
04:27:53.750 --> 04:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
gave you the wrong amendment number
 
04:27:57.110 --> 04:27:57.120 align:start position:0%
uh that was the earlier version
 
04:27:59.870 --> 04:27:59.880 align:start position:0%
um so can we reconsider or whatever the
 
04:28:01.969 --> 04:28:01.979 align:start position:0%
correct yeah
 
04:28:04.370 --> 04:28:04.380 align:start position:0%
I think that's an editorial correction
 
04:28:06.469 --> 04:28:06.479 align:start position:0%
since we know that you meant the right
 
04:28:09.050 --> 04:28:09.060 align:start position:0%
Amendment what is the correct zero two
 
04:28:11.870 --> 04:28:11.880 align:start position:0%
six nine H and my apologies to the
 
04:28:11.880 --> 04:28:13.130 align:start position:0%
six nine H and my apologies to the
committee

04:28:13.130 --> 04:28:13.140 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:28:16.010 --> 04:28:16.020 align:start position:0%
oh 269 and perhaps you have copies of
 
04:28:17.450 --> 04:28:17.460 align:start position:0%
that Amendment
 
04:28:17.460 --> 04:28:20.630 align:start position:0%
that Amendment
um

04:28:20.630 --> 04:28:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:23.030 --> 04:28:23.040 align:start position:0%
don't we all have to have a copy of the
 
04:28:25.370 --> 04:28:25.380 align:start position:0%
amendment to vote on it or no
 
04:28:26.689 --> 04:28:26.699 align:start position:0%
depends on how much you trust
 
04:28:28.729 --> 04:28:28.739 align:start position:0%
representative blackis now I don't know
 
04:28:31.250 --> 04:28:31.260 align:start position:0%
how much you do uh it is though zero two
 
04:28:34.370 --> 04:28:34.380 align:start position:0%
six nine H is as I described and the
 
04:28:38.210 --> 04:28:38.220 align:start position:0%
difference between 22h and 0269h
 
04:28:41.750 --> 04:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
is the allowing for splits other than 50
 
04:28:46.490 --> 04:28:46.500 align:start position:0%
50. it allows 50 50 60 40 and 70 30.
 
04:28:48.170 --> 04:28:48.180 align:start position:0%
which the retirement system was all
 
04:28:49.370 --> 04:28:49.380 align:start position:0%
right with they didn't want it to go
 
04:28:51.830 --> 04:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
further than that all right I think we
 
04:28:51.840 --> 04:28:53.469 align:start position:0%
further than that all right I think we
will

04:28:53.469 --> 04:28:53.479 align:start position:0%
will
 
04:28:56.510 --> 04:28:56.520 align:start position:0%
going at this for I think we will take a
 
04:28:59.750 --> 04:28:59.760 align:start position:0%
short break to end representative
 
04:29:01.370 --> 04:29:01.380 align:start position:0%
blackis will get copies of that
 
04:29:04.370 --> 04:29:04.380 align:start position:0%
Amendment for all of us and we will
 
04:29:07.250 --> 04:29:07.260 align:start position:0%
decide if we need to whether that's what
 
04:29:09.110 --> 04:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
we thought we were voting on or not how
 
04:29:11.990 --> 04:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
short is the break 10 minutes I'll run
 
04:29:14.330 --> 04:29:14.340 align:start position:0%
right up
 
04:29:16.929 --> 04:29:16.939 align:start position:0%
yeah it just splits it down to 70 30.
 
04:29:16.939 --> 04:29:23.229 align:start position:0%
yeah it just splits it down to 70 30.
yeah

04:29:23.229 --> 04:29:23.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:25.429 --> 04:29:25.439 align:start position:0%
did you pick them up
 
04:29:28.070 --> 04:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
no okay representative person I don't
 
04:29:30.769 --> 04:29:30.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:30.779 --> 04:29:33.769 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:29:33.769 --> 04:29:33.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:37.550 --> 04:29:37.560 align:start position:0%
okay so I'm just my only concern is I
 
04:29:39.170 --> 04:29:39.180 align:start position:0%
mean I guess it doesn't matter all that
 
04:29:40.790 --> 04:29:40.800 align:start position:0%
much just making sure that everybody is
 
04:29:42.229 --> 04:29:42.239 align:start position:0%
in support and doesn't have any problems
 
04:29:44.809 --> 04:29:44.819 align:start position:0%
with it that's why you have to meet
 
04:29:47.510 --> 04:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
that's why you have I mean OLS will be
 
04:29:47.520 --> 04:29:52.389 align:start position:0%
that's why you have I mean OLS will be
there

04:29:52.389 --> 04:29:52.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:28.550 --> 04:42:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:31.070 --> 04:42:31.080 align:start position:0%
for the committee we have we have
 
04:42:34.010 --> 04:42:34.020 align:start position:0%
received a very nice thank you note from
 
04:42:36.890 --> 04:42:36.900 align:start position:0%
Heather it's posted on the board
 
04:42:40.030 --> 04:42:40.040 align:start position:0%
she thanks us for our our farewell gift
 
04:42:43.430 --> 04:42:43.440 align:start position:0%
and invite us to stay in touch so we
 
04:42:45.650 --> 04:42:45.660 align:start position:0%
will do so
 
04:42:45.660 --> 04:42:48.190 align:start position:0%
will do so
and

04:42:48.190 --> 04:42:48.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:42:50.990 --> 04:42:51.000 align:start position:0%
has everyone had a chance to look at
 
04:42:57.650 --> 04:42:57.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:00.530 --> 04:43:00.540 align:start position:0%
I guess so okay is this what you thought
 
04:43:04.610 --> 04:43:04.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:07.970 --> 04:43:07.980 align:start position:0%
yes okay in that case we will consider
 
04:43:10.430 --> 04:43:10.440 align:start position:0%
the previous amendment number and
 
04:43:13.250 --> 04:43:13.260 align:start position:0%
editorial mistake and
 
04:43:22.730 --> 04:43:22.740 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:26.930 --> 04:43:26.940 align:start position:0%
all right on House Bill 258 uh I don't
 
04:43:30.708 --> 04:43:30.718 align:start position:0%
want to take that up today because
 
04:43:30.718 --> 04:43:31.970 align:start position:0%
want to take that up today because
um

04:43:31.970 --> 04:43:31.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:43:34.310 --> 04:43:34.320 align:start position:0%
the the chiropractors and the
 
04:43:36.170 --> 04:43:36.180 align:start position:0%
veterinarians are still talking about it
 
04:43:38.868 --> 04:43:38.878 align:start position:0%
is that correct representative Lucas
 
04:43:41.628 --> 04:43:41.638 align:start position:0%
uh Yes actually the Chiropractic board
 
04:43:43.550 --> 04:43:43.560 align:start position:0%
is okay with what we're looking at doing
 
04:43:45.770 --> 04:43:45.780 align:start position:0%
which was just require nationally
 
04:43:47.930 --> 04:43:47.940 align:start position:0%
recognized certification I heard back
 
04:43:50.510 --> 04:43:50.520 align:start position:0%
from one member of the vet board that
 
04:43:52.070 --> 04:43:52.080 align:start position:0%
they're okay with the plan but the whole
 
04:43:53.810 --> 04:43:53.820 align:start position:0%
board doesn't meet till the 15th so we
 
04:43:55.190 --> 04:43:55.200 align:start position:0%
have to hear their I want to wait to
 
04:43:57.530 --> 04:43:57.540 align:start position:0%
hear their official okay response and
 
04:43:59.750 --> 04:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
that is not a an early bill so we can

is that the one you get or did I get I
 
04:48:07.128 --> 04:48:07.138 align:start position:0%

04:48:10.310 --> 04:48:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:12.708 --> 04:48:12.718 align:start position:0%
I have a lovely Amendment here that came
 
04:48:15.230 --> 04:48:15.240 align:start position:0%
as a result of a subcommittee meeting
 
04:48:17.990 --> 04:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
that we had with the sponsor of the bill
 
04:48:20.448 --> 04:48:20.458 align:start position:0%
and the DHHS
 
04:48:24.350 --> 04:48:24.360 align:start position:0%
which I will pass out there you go
 
04:48:28.690 --> 04:48:28.700 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:33.410 --> 04:48:33.420 align:start position:0%
152h and essentially
 
04:48:36.170 --> 04:48:36.180 align:start position:0%
the um
 
04:48:38.270 --> 04:48:38.280 align:start position:0%
okay the amendment before you speak on
 
04:48:44.590 --> 04:48:44.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:48.170 --> 04:48:48.180 align:start position:0%
thank you so um and they were this part
 
04:48:50.390 --> 04:48:50.400 align:start position:0%
had this Bill had two parts the first
 
04:48:52.788 --> 04:48:52.798 align:start position:0%
part was the part that we were all
 
04:48:55.150 --> 04:48:55.160 align:start position:0%
having issues with the second part
 
04:48:58.190 --> 04:48:58.200 align:start position:0%
changed the reporting from six months to
 
04:49:00.410 --> 04:49:00.420 align:start position:0%
a year which
 
04:49:00.420 --> 04:49:01.430 align:start position:0%
a year which
um

04:49:01.430 --> 04:49:01.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:49:04.310 --> 04:49:04.320 align:start position:0%
stayed unchanged as a result of the
 
04:49:06.050 --> 04:49:06.060 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meeting everyone's in
 
04:49:09.110 --> 04:49:09.120 align:start position:0%
agreement with part two and um so the
 
04:49:11.690 --> 04:49:11.700 align:start position:0%
only the only thing that Amendment the
 
04:49:14.628 --> 04:49:14.638 align:start position:0%
amendment does is Char change part one
 
04:49:18.410 --> 04:49:18.420 align:start position:0%
and merely updates the language to enter
 
04:49:21.350 --> 04:49:21.360 align:start position:0%
into a memorandum of understanding we no
 
04:49:23.990 --> 04:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
longer use a memorandum of agreement as
 
04:49:26.110 --> 04:49:26.120 align:start position:0%
the nomenclature
 
04:49:26.120 --> 04:49:27.650 align:start position:0%
the nomenclature
so

04:49:27.650 --> 04:49:27.660 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:49:30.230 --> 04:49:30.240 align:start position:0%
um we changed it to update into a
 
04:49:32.390 --> 04:49:32.400 align:start position:0%
memorandum of understanding on
 
04:49:34.670 --> 04:49:34.680 align:start position:0%
Cooperative regarding data sharing
 
04:49:36.050 --> 04:49:36.060 align:start position:0%
between the Department of Health and
 
04:49:37.610 --> 04:49:37.620 align:start position:0%
Human Services and the Department of
 
04:49:39.530 --> 04:49:39.540 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services
 
04:49:41.448 --> 04:49:41.458 align:start position:0%
which is something that everybody agreed
 
04:49:43.550 --> 04:49:43.560 align:start position:0%
to and they do appreciate having the
 
04:49:46.730 --> 04:49:46.740 align:start position:0%
testing going from every six months to
 
04:49:49.788 --> 04:49:49.798 align:start position:0%
every year so I hope that the committee
 
04:49:49.798 --> 04:49:50.890 align:start position:0%
every year so I hope that the committee
will

04:49:50.890 --> 04:49:50.900 align:start position:0%
will
 
04:49:54.050 --> 04:49:54.060 align:start position:0%

House Bill 409
 
04:53:38.930 --> 04:53:38.940 align:start position:0%
um the language was to the original
 
04:53:43.128 --> 04:53:43.138 align:start position:0%
language was to strike the sentence
 
04:53:44.990 --> 04:53:45.000 align:start position:0%
um other states licensing requirements
 
04:53:46.788 --> 04:53:46.798 align:start position:0%
are substantially equivalent or higher
 
04:53:48.470 --> 04:53:48.480 align:start position:0%
two than those of the state
 
04:53:51.830 --> 04:53:51.840 align:start position:0%
and the recommendation from oplc rightly
 
04:53:53.810 --> 04:53:53.820 align:start position:0%
so was to make sure that the applicant
 
04:53:56.628 --> 04:53:56.638 align:start position:0%
held the current license in the in that
 
04:54:00.708 --> 04:54:00.718 align:start position:0%
other state that was in good standing
 
04:54:04.190 --> 04:54:04.200 align:start position:0%
and the definition of good standing is
 
04:54:06.650 --> 04:54:06.660 align:start position:0%
that which is defined by rules which are
 
04:54:09.410 --> 04:54:09.420 align:start position:0%
the current board rules which are found
 
04:54:14.868 --> 04:54:14.878 align:start position:0%

okay
 
05:03:42.530 --> 05:03:42.540 align:start position:0%
um so House Bill 266 and I'm sorry I
 
05:03:44.570 --> 05:03:44.580 align:start position:0%
don't have my bill in front of me but it
 
05:03:46.730 --> 05:03:46.740 align:start position:0%
does um basically codify what should be
 
05:03:50.208 --> 05:03:50.218 align:start position:0%
happening in for hybrid and and virtual
 
05:03:50.218 --> 05:03:51.730 align:start position:0%
happening in for hybrid and and virtual
agencies

05:03:51.730 --> 05:03:51.740 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
05:03:55.430 --> 05:03:55.440 align:start position:0%
hybrid meetings I'm so sorry let me let
 
05:03:57.490 --> 05:03:57.500 align:start position:0%
me start that over
 
05:03:59.810 --> 05:03:59.820 align:start position:0%
this is what is actually should be
 
05:04:02.570 --> 05:04:02.580 align:start position:0%
happening with hybrid and virtual agency
 
05:04:04.730 --> 05:04:04.740 align:start position:0%
meetings because we went from a
 
05:04:06.530 --> 05:04:06.540 align:start position:0%
situation where we were having all
 
05:04:08.570 --> 05:04:08.580 align:start position:0%
virtual meetings to those hybrid
 
05:04:12.230 --> 05:04:12.240 align:start position:0%
meetings there was some discussion and
 
05:04:12.240 --> 05:04:13.070 align:start position:0%
meetings there was some discussion and
some

05:04:13.070 --> 05:04:13.080 align:start position:0%
some
 
05:04:15.470 --> 05:04:15.480 align:start position:0%
um it was it was necessary for us to
 
05:04:18.110 --> 05:04:18.120 align:start position:0%
actually write to codify what should be
 
05:04:21.110 --> 05:04:21.120 align:start position:0%
happening in these agency meetings so
 
05:04:23.208 --> 05:04:23.218 align:start position:0%
that was the purpose of this bill
 
05:04:23.218 --> 05:04:24.650 align:start position:0%
that was the purpose of this bill
yeah

05:04:24.650 --> 05:04:24.660 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:04:28.788 --> 05:04:28.798 align:start position:0%
maybe I'd like to say that it was it it
 
05:04:31.730 --> 05:04:31.740 align:start position:0%
is essentially what the governor imposed
 
05:04:34.250 --> 05:04:34.260 align:start position:0%
as emergency rules during the emergency
 
05:04:38.090 --> 05:04:38.100 align:start position:0%
of covid and it worked out fairly well
 
05:04:39.948 --> 05:04:39.958 align:start position:0%
for some meetings
 
05:04:39.958 --> 05:04:41.330 align:start position:0%
for some meetings
does

05:04:41.330 --> 05:04:41.340 align:start position:0%
does
 
05:04:45.170 --> 05:04:45.180 align:start position:0%
meet the requirements of 91a but it does
 
05:04:47.330 --> 05:04:47.340 align:start position:0%
not authorize any remote or hybrid
 
05:04:47.340 --> 05:04:48.530 align:start position:0%
not authorize any remote or hybrid
meetings

05:04:48.530 --> 05:04:48.540 align:start position:0%
meetings
 
05:04:50.448 --> 05:04:50.458 align:start position:0%
it just says if you're going to have one
 
05:04:52.550 --> 05:04:52.560 align:start position:0%
this is what you have to do
 
05:04:56.150 --> 05:04:56.160 align:start position:0%
and so that's the intent of the bill
 
05:04:58.868 --> 05:04:58.878 align:start position:0%
anyone else have a comment or a question
 
05:05:03.708 --> 05:05:03.718 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt okay good
 
05:05:06.110 --> 05:05:06.120 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you yes
 
05:05:08.208 --> 05:05:08.218 align:start position:0%
representative since we're no longer
 
05:05:11.570 --> 05:05:11.580 align:start position:0%
under the emergency order from the
 
05:05:13.430 --> 05:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
governor does this does that complicate
 
05:05:13.440 --> 05:05:14.270 align:start position:0%
governor does this does that complicate
uh

05:05:14.270 --> 05:05:14.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:05:17.930 --> 05:05:17.940 align:start position:0%
processing it yes it means that they
 
05:05:22.610 --> 05:05:22.620 align:start position:0%
that if a board wishes say to hold a
 
05:05:26.150 --> 05:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
hybrid hearing on their rules so that's
 
05:05:29.208 --> 05:05:29.218 align:start position:0%
more convenient for people to call in
 
05:05:31.390 --> 05:05:31.400 align:start position:0%
or witness it
 
05:05:33.590 --> 05:05:33.600 align:start position:0%
without actually having to come to
 
05:05:35.990 --> 05:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
Concord this says these are the things
 
05:05:37.910 --> 05:05:37.920 align:start position:0%
you have to do to comply with the right
 
05:05:40.190 --> 05:05:40.200 align:start position:0%
to know law
 
05:05:42.530 --> 05:05:42.540 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:05:44.570 --> 05:05:44.580 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
05:05:47.810 --> 05:05:47.820 align:start position:0%
all right seeing seeing no one else the
 
05:05:49.610 --> 05:05:49.620 align:start position:0%
motion is ought to pass on House Bill
 
05:05:52.970 --> 05:05:52.980 align:start position:0%
266 and the clerk can call the roll and
 
05:05:54.770 --> 05:05:54.780 align:start position:0%
can I just ask that the clerk not call
 
05:05:58.010 --> 05:05:58.020 align:start position:0%

okay Schmidt and Bailey
 
05:07:06.590 --> 05:07:06.600 align:start position:0%
you wish to speak to your motion
 
05:07:11.570 --> 05:07:11.580 align:start position:0%
uh yes uh everybody should know uh so
 
05:07:14.570 --> 05:07:14.580 align:start position:0%
as much as I admire representative the
 
05:07:16.550 --> 05:07:16.560 align:start position:0%
sponsor shall I say the sponsor's
 
05:07:19.730 --> 05:07:19.740 align:start position:0%
enthusiasm for the exciting potential of
 
05:07:23.750 --> 05:07:23.760 align:start position:0%
a lieutenant governor uh I I don't think
 
05:07:27.350 --> 05:07:27.360 align:start position:0%
that should be a real Criterion for our
 
05:07:29.090 --> 05:07:29.100 align:start position:0%
decision as to whether this is a wise
 
05:07:32.270 --> 05:07:32.280 align:start position:0%
idea and the bottom line really for me
 
05:07:35.750 --> 05:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
is that this is this system has been in
 
05:07:39.650 --> 05:07:39.660 align:start position:0%
effect for something like 240 years in
 
05:07:42.410 --> 05:07:42.420 align:start position:0%
that time to my knowledge we've had
 
05:07:45.050 --> 05:07:45.060 align:start position:0%
three occasions in which the lieutenant
 
05:07:47.628 --> 05:07:47.638 align:start position:0%
governor uh certainly in the last 100
 
05:07:50.208 --> 05:07:50.218 align:start position:0%
years or so three occasions in which the
 
05:07:52.430 --> 05:07:52.440 align:start position:0%
lieutenant in which a lieutenant
 
05:07:55.128 --> 05:07:55.138 align:start position:0%
governor had we had one would have had
 
05:07:57.590 --> 05:07:57.600 align:start position:0%
to step in for the governor two of them
 
05:08:01.190 --> 05:08:01.200 align:start position:0%
were when former governors resigned
 
05:08:04.310 --> 05:08:04.320 align:start position:0%
their office a day or two before the end
 
05:08:07.628 --> 05:08:07.638 align:start position:0%
of their term to be able to be sworn in
 
05:08:11.448 --> 05:08:11.458 align:start position:0%
uh as U.S senators okay one was governor
 
05:08:13.850 --> 05:08:13.860 align:start position:0%
Hassle and the other one was governor
 
05:08:16.628 --> 05:08:16.638 align:start position:0%
Greg I think I may be wrong about that
 
05:08:19.430 --> 05:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
the other occasion was when former
 
05:08:23.350 --> 05:08:23.360 align:start position:0%
Governor Hugh Allen died in office
 
05:08:27.708 --> 05:08:27.718 align:start position:0%
and and the Senate President took over
 
05:08:27.718 --> 05:08:28.850 align:start position:0%
and and the Senate President took over
for

05:08:28.850 --> 05:08:28.860 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:08:31.610 --> 05:08:31.620 align:start position:0%
I think about a month
 
05:08:35.570 --> 05:08:35.580 align:start position:0%
so the system works the framers put it
 
05:08:40.850 --> 05:08:40.860 align:start position:0%
together uh to be Thrifty and we still
 
05:08:43.730 --> 05:08:43.740 align:start position:0%
try to be Thrifty here I think in New
 
05:08:47.090 --> 05:08:47.100 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and and and so that's on the
 
05:08:49.750 --> 05:08:49.760 align:start position:0%
one side but also I think that
 
05:08:54.050 --> 05:08:54.060 align:start position:0%
this plan is very ill-defined in terms
 
05:08:56.990 --> 05:08:57.000 align:start position:0%
of how it would work and what it would
 
05:08:57.000 --> 05:08:58.788 align:start position:0%
of how it would work and what it would
cost

05:08:58.788 --> 05:08:58.798 align:start position:0%
cost
 
05:09:02.390 --> 05:09:02.400 align:start position:0%
what it would cost I the sponsor seems
 
05:09:04.730 --> 05:09:04.740 align:start position:0%
to think it could be done for one
 
05:09:04.740 --> 05:09:05.890 align:start position:0%
to think it could be done for one
person's

05:09:05.890 --> 05:09:05.900 align:start position:0%
person's
 
05:09:08.090 --> 05:09:08.100 align:start position:0%
150 a year
 
05:09:11.448 --> 05:09:11.458 align:start position:0%
uh dependium and so forth
 
05:09:15.110 --> 05:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
and I think the the lieutenant governor
 
05:09:17.448 --> 05:09:17.458 align:start position:0%
would have to have a driver you're not
 
05:09:19.310 --> 05:09:19.320 align:start position:0%
going to have this person driving all
 
05:09:21.530 --> 05:09:21.540 align:start position:0%
over the state speaking on behalf of the
 
05:09:23.448 --> 05:09:23.458 align:start position:0%
governor because he or she is going to
 
05:09:25.910 --> 05:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
do something besides sit there and and
 
05:09:27.770 --> 05:09:27.780 align:start position:0%
wait for the governor to become
 
05:09:27.780 --> 05:09:29.570 align:start position:0%
wait for the governor to become
incapacitated

05:09:29.570 --> 05:09:29.580 align:start position:0%
incapacitated
 
05:09:33.350 --> 05:09:33.360 align:start position:0%
and as I said we have not had that so
 
05:09:34.850 --> 05:09:34.860 align:start position:0%
the person is going to have a driver
 
05:09:36.890 --> 05:09:36.900 align:start position:0%
slash bodyguard just like the governor
 
05:09:40.010 --> 05:09:40.020 align:start position:0%
does it's a State Trooper okay but
 
05:09:41.448 --> 05:09:41.458 align:start position:0%
somebody's going to answer the telephone
 
05:09:43.368 --> 05:09:43.378 align:start position:0%
the lieutenant governor is not going to
 
05:09:46.128 --> 05:09:46.138 align:start position:0%
be answering his or her own telephone uh
 
05:09:47.390 --> 05:09:47.400 align:start position:0%
and they're going to be some staff
 
05:09:50.030 --> 05:09:50.040 align:start position:0%
people so I think this is going to be a
 
05:09:51.708 --> 05:09:51.718 align:start position:0%
lot pricier than
 
05:09:57.350 --> 05:09:57.360 align:start position:0%
than what the sponsor thinks and it it
 
05:10:00.890 --> 05:10:00.900 align:start position:0%
is as I used to say Ann Landers said if
 
05:10:03.948 --> 05:10:03.958 align:start position:0%
it ain't broke don't fix it our system
 
05:10:07.128 --> 05:10:07.138 align:start position:0%
is not broken and we should not do this
 
05:10:09.770 --> 05:10:09.780 align:start position:0%
so thank you all answer any questions if
 
05:10:12.050 --> 05:10:12.060 align:start position:0%
anybody has one
 
05:10:12.060 --> 05:10:13.190 align:start position:0%
anybody has one
really

05:10:13.190 --> 05:10:13.200 align:start position:0%
really
 
05:10:15.470 --> 05:10:15.480 align:start position:0%
I believe representative Schmitz
 
05:10:17.448 --> 05:10:17.458 align:start position:0%
hit it right on my head oh all right
 
05:10:18.948 --> 05:10:18.958 align:start position:0%
thank you anyone else representative
 
05:10:21.530 --> 05:10:21.540 align:start position:0%
fleckis and then shewitt thank you
 
05:10:23.270 --> 05:10:23.280 align:start position:0%
um yeah the prime sponsor is a good
 
05:10:25.730 --> 05:10:25.740 align:start position:0%
friend and he raised what is potentially
 
05:10:28.490 --> 05:10:28.500 align:start position:0%
a real issue which could have been uh to
 
05:10:30.770 --> 05:10:30.780 align:start position:0%
one side serious disadvantage in 2019
 
05:10:33.650 --> 05:10:33.660 align:start position:0%
and 2020 however
 
05:10:36.170 --> 05:10:36.180 align:start position:0%
um you know adding having someone who is
 
05:10:38.330 --> 05:10:38.340 align:start position:0%
elected but has nothing to do I think is
 
05:10:38.340 --> 05:10:39.170 align:start position:0%
elected but has nothing to do I think is
a

05:10:39.170 --> 05:10:39.180 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:10:42.590 --> 05:10:42.600 align:start position:0%
an opportunity for mischief and uh and
 
05:10:44.208 --> 05:10:44.218 align:start position:0%
I'm willing to accept that risk and the
 
05:10:46.670 --> 05:10:46.680 align:start position:0%
risk is on both sides so uh
 
05:10:48.948 --> 05:10:48.958 align:start position:0%
I don't think we need to do this thanks
 
05:10:50.330 --> 05:10:50.340 align:start position:0%
I'm sure
 
05:10:52.128 --> 05:10:52.138 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
05:10:55.310 --> 05:10:55.320 align:start position:0%
yeah I think first off that this is a
 
05:10:59.510 --> 05:10:59.520 align:start position:0%
little unrealistic that at the cost that
 
05:11:02.390 --> 05:11:02.400 align:start position:0%
was put forward particularly I will
 
05:11:04.970 --> 05:11:04.980 align:start position:0%
state in answer to representative
 
05:11:08.510 --> 05:11:08.520 align:start position:0%
Schmidt's comment and on behalf of the
 
05:11:12.110 --> 05:11:12.120 align:start position:0%
women who are in government the person
 
05:11:14.930 --> 05:11:14.940 align:start position:0%
who did replace
 
05:11:18.170 --> 05:11:18.180 align:start position:0%
Governor Hugh Allen was destroy the
 
05:11:20.030 --> 05:11:20.040 align:start position:0%
Senate President thus becoming
 
05:11:22.368 --> 05:11:22.378 align:start position:0%
technically the first female governor of
 
05:11:25.070 --> 05:11:25.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so that worked out to be a
 
05:11:26.448 --> 05:11:26.458 align:start position:0%
good thing
 
05:11:29.750 --> 05:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
okay excellent representative
 
05:11:32.750 --> 05:11:32.760 align:start position:0%
yes just one comment so
 
05:11:36.050 --> 05:11:36.060 align:start position:0%
um I I respect the sponsor however I
 
05:11:37.670 --> 05:11:37.680 align:start position:0%
agree with everybody's comments and then
 
05:11:41.990 --> 05:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
one last comment is that the Senate
 
05:11:45.650 --> 05:11:45.660 align:start position:0%
President does not make sense for any
 
05:11:47.690 --> 05:11:47.700 align:start position:0%
checks and balances in place and so
 
05:11:50.390 --> 05:11:50.400 align:start position:0%
maybe in the future this legislative
 
05:11:53.270 --> 05:11:53.280 align:start position:0%
body May might come up with a bill that
 
05:11:55.490 --> 05:11:55.500 align:start position:0%
would support someone else on staff such
 
05:11:58.010 --> 05:11:58.020 align:start position:0%
as the five executive counselors that
 
05:12:00.650 --> 05:12:00.660 align:start position:0%
exist right below the governor and still
 
05:12:03.410 --> 05:12:03.420 align:start position:0%
in the governor's Branch thank you
 
05:12:06.830 --> 05:12:06.840 align:start position:0%
thank you anyone else have a comment
 
05:12:09.110 --> 05:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none the motion is an
 
05:12:12.288 --> 05:12:12.298 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate on cacr1 by

representative Schmidt and the clerk can
 
05:12:16.128 --> 05:12:16.138 align:start position:0%

consent the motion passed 20-0
 
05:13:00.110 --> 05:13:00.120 align:start position:0%
I'd known you were going to be unanimous
 
05:13:03.470 --> 05:13:03.480 align:start position:0%
I would made motions more often
 
05:13:05.570 --> 05:13:05.580 align:start position:0%
it's due to your eloquence
 
05:13:07.670 --> 05:13:07.680 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt
 
05:13:09.890 --> 05:13:09.900 align:start position:0%
and good
 
05:13:13.128 --> 05:13:13.138 align:start position:0%
ah it's also due to good selection of
 
05:13:16.070 --> 05:13:16.080 align:start position:0%
bills to make motions on
 
05:13:17.990 --> 05:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
all right we'll put this one on consent
 
05:13:21.230 --> 05:13:21.240 align:start position:0%
also and
 
05:13:23.750 --> 05:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
all right let's go back to house bill
 
05:13:23.760 --> 05:13:25.550 align:start position:0%
all right let's go back to house bill

05:13:25.550 --> 05:13:25.560 align:start position:0%
250.
 
05:13:28.190 --> 05:13:28.200 align:start position:0%

HB 250.
 
05:13:38.810 --> 05:13:38.820 align:start position:0%
okay is there a second representative
 
05:13:40.610 --> 05:13:40.620 align:start position:0%
goalie second
 
05:13:46.190 --> 05:13:46.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:48.650 --> 05:13:48.660 align:start position:0%
you should speak to your motion
 
05:13:50.570 --> 05:13:50.580 align:start position:0%
um yes after a testimony from the New
 
05:13:52.070 --> 05:13:52.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire retirement system it's
 
05:13:52.080 --> 05:13:53.628 align:start position:0%
Hampshire retirement system it's
representative

05:13:53.628 --> 05:13:53.638 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:13:53.638 --> 05:13:54.350 align:start position:0%
representative
um

05:13:54.350 --> 05:13:54.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:13:56.510 --> 05:13:56.520 align:start position:0%
the intent of the bill was what I had
 
05:13:57.708 --> 05:13:57.718 align:start position:0%
previously thought or close to
 
05:13:59.990 --> 05:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
previously what I thought it was
 
05:14:01.990 --> 05:14:02.000 align:start position:0%
um I feel like if one of our group two
 
05:14:05.330 --> 05:14:05.340 align:start position:0%
employees dies uh
 
05:14:08.810 --> 05:14:08.820 align:start position:0%
in the line of duty protecting us that
 
05:14:10.070 --> 05:14:10.080 align:start position:0%
this is the least that we can do for
 
05:14:12.288 --> 05:14:12.298 align:start position:0%
them and once again the fiscal note on
 
05:14:13.730 --> 05:14:13.740 align:start position:0%
an assessed small that can barely
 
05:14:16.670 --> 05:14:16.680 align:start position:0%
calculate it so just seems reasonable
 
05:14:18.830 --> 05:14:18.840 align:start position:0%
and common sense to me
 
05:14:20.990 --> 05:14:21.000 align:start position:0%
representative goalie to speak to you
 
05:14:23.990 --> 05:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair yes
 
05:14:27.530 --> 05:14:27.540 align:start position:0%
as was said earlier that
 
05:14:30.890 --> 05:14:30.900 align:start position:0%
there is the option to choose 100 for
 
05:14:33.350 --> 05:14:33.360 align:start position:0%
your surviving spouse have you should
 
05:14:34.810 --> 05:14:34.820 align:start position:0%
you retain
 
05:14:37.368 --> 05:14:37.378 align:start position:0%
retirement age
 
05:14:40.670 --> 05:14:40.680 align:start position:0%
and pass away after you retire
 
05:14:43.610 --> 05:14:43.620 align:start position:0%
so if you retired
 
05:14:46.310 --> 05:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
and heaven forbid you dropped it two
 
05:14:47.930 --> 05:14:47.940 align:start position:0%
days after retirement your spouse can
 
05:14:50.330 --> 05:14:50.340 align:start position:0%
collect 100 percent
 
05:14:52.910 --> 05:14:52.920 align:start position:0%
currently the way the law is
 
05:14:56.448 --> 05:14:56.458 align:start position:0%
if you die in the line of duty
 
05:14:59.208 --> 05:14:59.218 align:start position:0%
you only get 50 percent
 
05:15:01.250 --> 05:15:01.260 align:start position:0%
now if that line of duty death could be
 
05:15:02.810 --> 05:15:02.820 align:start position:0%
one day before retirement had you
 
05:15:04.550 --> 05:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
retired and dropped a day later you'd
 
05:15:06.590 --> 05:15:06.600 align:start position:0%
get the 100 so I think it's a matter of
 
05:15:08.330 --> 05:15:08.340 align:start position:0%
codifying the statutes and making sure
 
05:15:10.788 --> 05:15:10.798 align:start position:0%
you have the ability to get the same
 
05:15:10.798 --> 05:15:16.010 align:start position:0%
you have the ability to get the same
amount

05:15:16.010 --> 05:15:16.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:18.770 --> 05:15:18.780 align:start position:0%
just uh my opposition before was based
 
05:15:20.990 --> 05:15:21.000 align:start position:0%
on confusion over the bill which luckily
 
05:15:23.150 --> 05:15:23.160 align:start position:0%
we got cleared up okay thank you
 
05:15:25.670 --> 05:15:25.680 align:start position:0%
represent baber and then she would thank
 
05:15:28.670 --> 05:15:28.680 align:start position:0%
you madam chair I'll just uh Echo what
 
05:15:31.788 --> 05:15:31.798 align:start position:0%
representative O'Brien presented which I
 
05:15:33.830 --> 05:15:33.840 align:start position:0%
thought was rather poignant uh
 
05:15:36.430 --> 05:15:36.440 align:start position:0%
particularly if a young
 
05:15:39.350 --> 05:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
first responder dies in the line of duty
 
05:15:41.090 --> 05:15:41.100 align:start position:0%
his family has
 
05:15:44.150 --> 05:15:44.160 align:start position:0%
set up their whole budget to pay the
 
05:15:46.670 --> 05:15:46.680 align:start position:0%
house payment to put the kids through
 
05:15:51.170 --> 05:15:51.180 align:start position:0%
college what have you and if he or she
 
05:15:51.180 --> 05:15:53.628 align:start position:0%
college what have you and if he or she
is

05:15:53.628 --> 05:15:53.638 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:15:57.470 --> 05:15:57.480 align:start position:0%
income gets reduced by 50 percent that
 
05:15:59.890 --> 05:15:59.900 align:start position:0%
upsets that plan for that whole family
 
05:16:03.650 --> 05:16:03.660 align:start position:0%
and perhaps even prevents them from
 
05:16:06.350 --> 05:16:06.360 align:start position:0%
being able to pay off the house puts
 
05:16:09.230 --> 05:16:09.240 align:start position:0%
them on the street that's just not right
 
05:16:12.350 --> 05:16:12.360 align:start position:0%
so I definitely support ought to pass
 
05:16:12.360 --> 05:16:14.690 align:start position:0%
so I definitely support ought to pass
representative

05:16:14.690 --> 05:16:14.700 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:16:17.690 --> 05:16:17.700 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I support
 
05:16:21.590 --> 05:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
ought to pass also and during the break
 
05:16:23.930 --> 05:16:23.940 align:start position:0%
I did speak with Marty from our
 
05:16:26.628 --> 05:16:26.638 align:start position:0%
retirement system in
 
05:16:28.910 --> 05:16:28.920 align:start position:0%
in a corrective action
 
05:16:31.850 --> 05:16:31.860 align:start position:0%
for myself alone that I will share with
 
05:16:34.610 --> 05:16:34.620 align:start position:0%
everybody else I've asked Marty to fill
 
05:16:37.850 --> 05:16:37.860 align:start position:0%
out a graph that I filled out for him
 
05:16:40.550 --> 05:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
that will give us very clear specifics
 
05:16:43.490 --> 05:16:43.500 align:start position:0%
give us a
 
05:16:43.500 --> 05:16:44.330 align:start position:0%
give us a
um

05:16:44.330 --> 05:16:44.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:16:48.230 --> 05:16:48.240 align:start position:0%
a real life example and will give us a
 
05:16:51.530 --> 05:16:51.540 align:start position:0%
before and after graph with monies tied
 
05:16:55.430 --> 05:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
to it with number of people affected and
 
05:16:56.750 --> 05:16:56.760 align:start position:0%
um that's what we use in the Aerospace
 
05:16:58.610 --> 05:16:58.620 align:start position:0%
and defense industry and I think it will
 
05:17:01.550 --> 05:17:01.560 align:start position:0%
work well for our committee as well and
 
05:17:03.410 --> 05:17:03.420 align:start position:0%
prevent what happened a few minutes ago
 
05:17:07.010 --> 05:17:07.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:07.020 --> 05:17:09.050 align:start position:0%
 
representative

05:17:09.050 --> 05:17:09.060 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:17:11.150 --> 05:17:11.160 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
05:17:14.390 --> 05:17:14.400 align:start position:0%
um I I cannot support the the ought to
 
05:17:14.400 --> 05:17:16.490 align:start position:0%
um I I cannot support the the ought to
pass

05:17:16.490 --> 05:17:16.500 align:start position:0%
pass
 
05:17:19.010 --> 05:17:19.020 align:start position:0%
for a number of reasons
 
05:17:19.020 --> 05:17:19.970 align:start position:0%
for a number of reasons
um

05:17:19.970 --> 05:17:19.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:17:22.850 --> 05:17:22.860 align:start position:0%
I don't know when this accidental
 
05:17:26.208 --> 05:17:26.218 align:start position:0%
benefit was first created
 
05:17:28.310 --> 05:17:28.320 align:start position:0%
but I will assume it's been on the books
 
05:17:29.510 --> 05:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
for a while
 
05:17:31.128 --> 05:17:31.138 align:start position:0%
and that
 
05:17:34.070 --> 05:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
people coming under this provision of
 
05:17:35.448 --> 05:17:35.458 align:start position:0%
the retirement
 
05:17:35.458 --> 05:17:36.708 align:start position:0%
the retirement
new

05:17:36.708 --> 05:17:36.718 align:start position:0%
new
 
05:17:40.430 --> 05:17:40.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:40.440 --> 05:17:42.650 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:17:42.650 --> 05:17:42.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:45.770 --> 05:17:45.780 align:start position:0%
if if towns wanted
 
05:17:47.690 --> 05:17:47.700 align:start position:0%
to come up with an accidental death
 
05:17:49.970 --> 05:17:49.980 align:start position:0%
benefit for their employees
 
05:17:51.650 --> 05:17:51.660 align:start position:0%
I'm sure that there's a way they could
 
05:17:53.208 --> 05:17:53.218 align:start position:0%
come up with a very inexpensive term
 
05:17:54.948 --> 05:17:54.958 align:start position:0%
life policy
 
05:17:56.570 --> 05:17:56.580 align:start position:0%
for the employees if that's something
 
05:18:01.788 --> 05:18:01.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:07.128 --> 05:18:07.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:09.050 --> 05:18:09.060 align:start position:0%
and because I don't have it right in
 
05:18:11.930 --> 05:18:11.940 align:start position:0%
front of me I will paraphrase Thou shalt
 
05:18:16.430 --> 05:18:16.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:21.050 --> 05:18:21.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:23.030 --> 05:18:23.040 align:start position:0%
you can downshift if it's just a little
 
05:18:23.040 --> 05:18:25.310 align:start position:0%
you can downshift if it's just a little
bit

05:18:25.310 --> 05:18:25.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:27.530 --> 05:18:27.540 align:start position:0%
it doesn't say that
 
05:18:31.490 --> 05:18:31.500 align:start position:0%
it just says Thou shalt not downshift
 
05:18:35.510 --> 05:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
and if the state wants to pay for this
 
05:18:38.208 --> 05:18:38.218 align:start position:0%
that's certainly another issue
 
05:18:40.310 --> 05:18:40.320 align:start position:0%
but in this case
 
05:18:43.490 --> 05:18:43.500 align:start position:0%
this benefit costs money
 
05:18:45.770 --> 05:18:45.780 align:start position:0%
and who's paying for it
 
05:18:49.730 --> 05:18:49.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:51.830 --> 05:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
and that is why I cannot support the
 
05:18:51.840 --> 05:18:52.910 align:start position:0%
and that is why I cannot support the
bill

05:18:52.910 --> 05:18:52.920 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:18:56.150 --> 05:18:56.160 align:start position:0%
because Thou shalt not downshift not
 
05:18:58.128 --> 05:18:58.138 align:start position:0%
even just a little bit
 
05:19:00.410 --> 05:19:00.420 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair okay
 
05:19:05.510 --> 05:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:08.990 --> 05:19:09.000 align:start position:0%
well yes representative Bailey
 
05:19:12.530 --> 05:19:12.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:17.150 --> 05:19:17.160 align:start position:0%
uh article 28a mandated programs the
 
05:19:19.910 --> 05:19:19.920 align:start position:0%
state shall not mandate or assign any
 
05:19:22.550 --> 05:19:22.560 align:start position:0%
new expanded or modified programs or
 
05:19:24.470 --> 05:19:24.480 align:start position:0%
responsibilities to any political
 
05:19:27.530 --> 05:19:27.540 align:start position:0%
subdivision in such a way as necessitate
 
05:19:29.990 --> 05:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
additional local expenditures by the
 
05:19:32.510 --> 05:19:32.520 align:start position:0%
political subdivision unless such
 
05:19:35.090 --> 05:19:35.100 align:start position:0%
programs or responsibilities are fully
 
05:19:35.100 --> 05:19:36.230 align:start position:0%
programs or responsibilities are fully
funded

05:19:36.230 --> 05:19:36.240 align:start position:0%
funded
 
05:19:38.930 --> 05:19:38.940 align:start position:0%
by the state or unless some such
 
05:19:40.550 --> 05:19:40.560 align:start position:0%
programs or responsibilities are
 
05:19:42.470 --> 05:19:42.480 align:start position:0%
approved for funding by a vote of the
 
05:19:44.690 --> 05:19:44.700 align:start position:0%
local legislative body of the political
 
05:19:44.700 --> 05:19:48.470 align:start position:0%
local legislative body of the political
subdivision

05:19:48.470 --> 05:19:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:52.550 --> 05:19:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:54.410 --> 05:19:54.420 align:start position:0%
in accordance with 28a would it be
 
05:19:55.788 --> 05:19:55.798 align:start position:0%
possible to
 
05:19:58.250 --> 05:19:58.260 align:start position:0%
have the political subdivisions vote if
 
05:20:00.890 --> 05:20:00.900 align:start position:0%
they wish to Institute such a
 
05:20:02.270 --> 05:20:02.280 align:start position:0%
benefit or
 
05:20:07.610 --> 05:20:07.620 align:start position:0%
no they do have they do vote to accept
 
05:20:11.810 --> 05:20:11.820 align:start position:0%
the retirement system it's it's the
 
05:20:14.890 --> 05:20:14.900 align:start position:0%
modified that makes it an issue
 
05:20:17.448 --> 05:20:17.458 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up I'm saying in this
 
05:20:17.458 --> 05:20:18.530 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up I'm saying in this
particular

05:20:18.530 --> 05:20:18.540 align:start position:0%
particular
 
05:20:21.350 --> 05:20:21.360 align:start position:0%
bill could they vote to opt-in
 
05:20:21.360 --> 05:20:22.670 align:start position:0%
bill could they vote to opt-in
no

05:20:22.670 --> 05:20:22.680 align:start position:0%
no
 
05:20:22.680 --> 05:20:25.550 align:start position:0%
no
no it

05:20:25.550 --> 05:20:25.560 align:start position:0%
no it
 
05:20:29.448 --> 05:20:29.458 align:start position:0%
it's the legislator votes to modify the
 
05:20:31.910 --> 05:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
pension system to this extent the towns
 
05:20:33.708 --> 05:20:33.718 align:start position:0%
will accept it
 
05:20:37.788 --> 05:20:37.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:46.670 --> 05:20:46.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:50.570 --> 05:20:50.580 align:start position:0%
ah so that the 50 of pay is
 
05:20:53.090 --> 05:20:53.100 align:start position:0%
was adopted by the towns and
 
05:20:55.010 --> 05:20:55.020 align:start position:0%
municipalities when they went into the
 
05:20:57.590 --> 05:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
pension system but the going to 100
 
05:20:59.330 --> 05:20:59.340 align:start position:0%
percent is a
 
05:21:03.470 --> 05:21:03.480 align:start position:0%
the 20th 2023 change that is not going
 
05:21:09.170 --> 05:21:09.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:11.208 --> 05:21:11.218 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt
 
05:21:13.628 --> 05:21:13.638 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if it's 100
 
05:21:16.910 --> 05:21:16.920 align:start position:0%
no apropos for this particular situation
 
05:21:20.570 --> 05:21:20.580 align:start position:0%
but uh about I don't know 17 or years
 
05:21:23.150 --> 05:21:23.160 align:start position:0%
ago or something like that we had a
 
05:21:26.390 --> 05:21:26.400 align:start position:0%
proposal for uh I think a hundred
 
05:21:30.590 --> 05:21:30.600 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar payout for uh Jeff
 
05:21:33.288 --> 05:21:33.298 align:start position:0%
represent Gauley that comes out of the
 
05:21:35.510 --> 05:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
general fund representative say what
 
05:21:38.330 --> 05:21:38.340 align:start position:0%
100 000 dollar benefit comes out of the
 
05:21:40.368 --> 05:21:40.378 align:start position:0%
of the fund exactly what but the thing
 
05:21:43.310 --> 05:21:43.320 align:start position:0%
was that there was a proposal for I
 
05:21:45.110 --> 05:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
think I was the only one here here then
 
05:21:47.510 --> 05:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
uh other than that representative goalie
 
05:21:49.190 --> 05:21:49.200 align:start position:0%
that's why I'm asking him to pay
 
05:21:51.590 --> 05:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
attention so that because I want you to
 
05:21:55.010 --> 05:21:55.020 align:start position:0%
corroborate or correct me if I'm wrong
 
05:21:56.868 --> 05:21:56.878 align:start position:0%
um there was a proposal for a hundred
 
05:21:59.448 --> 05:21:59.458 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar death penalty for First
 
05:22:02.150 --> 05:22:02.160 align:start position:0%
Responders as I recall right
 
05:22:04.310 --> 05:22:04.320 align:start position:0%
um and we looked at initially it was
 
05:22:06.708 --> 05:22:06.718 align:start position:0%
going to be an insurance policy of some
 
05:22:09.530 --> 05:22:09.540 align:start position:0%
sort and they looked at the we looked at
 
05:22:11.708 --> 05:22:11.718 align:start position:0%
it and the cost of the insurance policy
 
05:22:14.090 --> 05:22:14.100 align:start position:0%
vis-a-vis the likelihood that there
 
05:22:17.330 --> 05:22:17.340 align:start position:0%
would be such a death penal benefit
 
05:22:20.208 --> 05:22:20.218 align:start position:0%
um was so much disparate that that we
 
05:22:22.490 --> 05:22:22.500 align:start position:0%
decided to do it out of the general fund
 
05:22:25.128 --> 05:22:25.138 align:start position:0%
and we've had very few of those in the
 
05:22:27.288 --> 05:22:27.298 align:start position:0%
16 or 17 years since that's happened
 
05:22:29.288 --> 05:22:29.298 align:start position:0%
they saved a lot of money in other words
 
05:22:31.788 --> 05:22:31.798 align:start position:0%
vis-a-vis what we would have paid for an
 
05:22:33.770 --> 05:22:33.780 align:start position:0%
insurance policy so I'm not sure if
 
05:22:35.628 --> 05:22:35.638 align:start position:0%
that's absolutely germane to this
 
05:22:37.550 --> 05:22:37.560 align:start position:0%
discussion but I wanted to make sure
 
05:22:39.708 --> 05:22:39.718 align:start position:0%
everybody knew
 
05:22:43.510 --> 05:22:43.520 align:start position:0%
uh yes it's not exactly Jermaine because
 
05:22:46.850 --> 05:22:46.860 align:start position:0%
this benefit increase is being charged
 
05:22:51.788 --> 05:22:51.798 align:start position:0%
to the retirement system and unless we
 
05:22:54.770 --> 05:22:54.780 align:start position:0%
terminally funded up front it will be
 
05:23:00.230 --> 05:23:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:05.330 --> 05:23:05.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:11.288 --> 05:23:11.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:13.628 --> 05:23:13.638 align:start position:0%
right I'm
 
05:23:16.930 --> 05:23:16.940 align:start position:0%
inclined to vote for this although if
 
05:23:19.670 --> 05:23:19.680 align:start position:0%
bills related similar to this are having
 
05:23:22.550 --> 05:23:22.560 align:start position:0%
similar facts come in the future I think
 
05:23:24.110 --> 05:23:24.120 align:start position:0%
a number should be more comfortable if
 
05:23:27.170 --> 05:23:27.180 align:start position:0%
they were fully funded by the state and
 
05:23:31.610 --> 05:23:31.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:31.620 --> 05:23:35.570 align:start position:0%

05:25:13.310 --> 05:25:13.320 align:start position:0%
it's here all right so I'm not finishing
 
05:25:15.410 --> 05:25:15.420 align:start position:0%
on a high note House Bill 180
 
05:25:18.110 --> 05:25:18.120 align:start position:0%
representative Rhoda you have a motion
 
05:25:24.650 --> 05:25:24.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:27.350 --> 05:25:27.360 align:start position:0%
I would like to move Amendment zero
 
05:25:30.830 --> 05:25:30.840 align:start position:0%
three five two authored by myself and
 
05:25:33.110 --> 05:25:33.120 align:start position:0%
representative Lucas
 
05:25:36.050 --> 05:25:36.060 align:start position:0%
and I will second it okay if you'd pass
 
05:25:38.628 --> 05:25:38.638 align:start position:0%
the amendment around oh of course I'm so
 
05:25:40.788 --> 05:25:40.798 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm looking at all the copies and
 
05:25:45.230 --> 05:25:45.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:58.430 --> 05:25:58.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:01.970 --> 05:26:01.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:04.970 --> 05:26:04.980 align:start position:0%
yes so
 
05:26:07.910 --> 05:26:07.920 align:start position:0%
I would like to know how many um I have
 
05:26:09.830 --> 05:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
I don't know the answer to this but I've
 
05:26:11.570 --> 05:26:11.580 align:start position:0%
we've heard this bill at least three
 
05:26:13.970 --> 05:26:13.980 align:start position:0%
times in my lifetime probably more
 
05:26:13.980 --> 05:26:15.350 align:start position:0%
times in my lifetime probably more
and

05:26:15.350 --> 05:26:15.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:26:18.708 --> 05:26:18.718 align:start position:0%
um the main concern that everyone seems
 
05:26:21.948 --> 05:26:21.958 align:start position:0%
to have in addition to having an
 
05:26:24.470 --> 05:26:24.480 align:start position:0%
indigenous people's day is having it on
 
05:26:27.670 --> 05:26:27.680 align:start position:0%
this particular day which is actually
 
05:26:31.430 --> 05:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
not really celebrated as Columbus Day it
 
05:26:33.350 --> 05:26:33.360 align:start position:0%
is actually celebrated as Italian
 
05:26:35.090 --> 05:26:35.100 align:start position:0%
Heritage today
 
05:26:37.430 --> 05:26:37.440 align:start position:0%
so this is a
 
05:26:40.788 --> 05:26:40.798 align:start position:0%
strong step in One Direction
 
05:26:45.050 --> 05:26:45.060 align:start position:0%
to change the name of Columbus Day as
 
05:26:48.830 --> 05:26:48.840 align:start position:0%
Italian Heritage day as one of the
 
05:26:51.830 --> 05:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
holidays that is celebrated in New
 
05:26:51.840 --> 05:26:54.288 align:start position:0%
holidays that is celebrated in New
Hampshire

05:26:54.288 --> 05:26:54.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:56.330 --> 05:26:56.340 align:start position:0%
and that's it we're just changing the
 
05:26:58.430 --> 05:26:58.440 align:start position:0%
name of Columbus Day to Italian Heritage
 
05:26:58.440 --> 05:26:59.810 align:start position:0%
name of Columbus Day to Italian Heritage
day

05:26:59.810 --> 05:26:59.820 align:start position:0%
day
 
05:27:01.910 --> 05:27:01.920 align:start position:0%
thank you representative you should
 
05:27:04.128 --> 05:27:04.138 align:start position:0%
speak to your second I do
 
05:27:06.288 --> 05:27:06.298 align:start position:0%
um I did this I support this for a
 
05:27:09.050 --> 05:27:09.060 align:start position:0%
number of reasons one is um
 
05:27:11.030 --> 05:27:11.040 align:start position:0%
I won't say anything unpleasant about
 
05:27:12.470 --> 05:27:12.480 align:start position:0%
some of the folks that came to testify
 
05:27:15.110 --> 05:27:15.120 align:start position:0%
before this committee but uh they made a
 
05:27:16.310 --> 05:27:16.320 align:start position:0%
threat which is they're going to come
 
05:27:19.910 --> 05:27:19.920 align:start position:0%
back forever until they uh get it passed
 
05:27:21.288 --> 05:27:21.298 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
05:27:23.690 --> 05:27:23.700 align:start position:0%
I figured this takes some ammo away from
 
05:27:28.128 --> 05:27:28.138 align:start position:0%
that effort which which I support and um
 
05:27:29.690 --> 05:27:29.700 align:start position:0%
the other thing that may be a little
 
05:27:31.730 --> 05:27:31.740 align:start position:0%
more comfortable is uh well uh represent
 
05:27:33.230 --> 05:27:33.240 align:start position:0%
I think petrigno
 
05:27:35.390 --> 05:27:35.400 align:start position:0%
who yeah he was the one who spoke
 
05:27:37.910 --> 05:27:37.920 align:start position:0%
eloquently against this bill
 
05:27:41.930 --> 05:27:41.940 align:start position:0%
is on board with this amendment
 
05:27:41.940 --> 05:27:42.770 align:start position:0%
is on board with this amendment
um

05:27:42.770 --> 05:27:42.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:27:45.948 --> 05:27:45.958 align:start position:0%
and uh well I'm not entirely comfortable
 
05:27:48.110 --> 05:27:48.120 align:start position:0%
with this going along this trend of
 
05:27:49.490 --> 05:27:49.500 align:start position:0%
erasing people from history almost
 
05:27:51.230 --> 05:27:51.240 align:start position:0%
anybody of significance from history has
 
05:27:54.650 --> 05:27:54.660 align:start position:0%
done Terrible Things Columbus included
 
05:27:58.850 --> 05:27:58.860 align:start position:0%
I think this is uh I don't feel strongly
 
05:27:58.860 --> 05:27:59.930 align:start position:0%
I think this is uh I don't feel strongly
but

05:27:59.930 --> 05:27:59.940 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:27:59.940 --> 05:28:00.830 align:start position:0%
but
um

05:28:00.830 --> 05:28:00.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:28:04.190 --> 05:28:04.200 align:start position:0%
those people irritated me I'm sorry to
 
05:28:06.350 --> 05:28:06.360 align:start position:0%
say yes representative like as we
 
05:28:08.090 --> 05:28:08.100 align:start position:0%

05:29:14.690 --> 05:29:14.700 align:start position:0%
about that this and if we send it in and
 
05:29:17.208 --> 05:29:17.218 align:start position:0%
it is determined to be non-germaine we
 
05:29:19.250 --> 05:29:19.260 align:start position:0%
will hold a
 
05:29:21.770 --> 05:29:21.780 align:start position:0%
public hearing on the amendment and then
 
05:29:24.590 --> 05:29:24.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:27.530 --> 05:29:27.540 align:start position:0%
but I think it it's close enough to
 
05:29:30.830 --> 05:29:30.840 align:start position:0%
Jermaine for in my opinion yes represent
 
05:29:30.840 --> 05:29:31.970 align:start position:0%
Jermaine for in my opinion yes represent
Gould

05:29:31.970 --> 05:29:31.980 align:start position:0%
Gould
 
05:29:34.430 --> 05:29:34.440 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I just want to say
 
05:29:38.810 --> 05:29:38.820 align:start position:0%
that for many of us who are Abenaki who
 
05:29:40.788 --> 05:29:40.798 align:start position:0%
are native American we feel very
 
05:29:42.830 --> 05:29:42.840 align:start position:0%
strongly that
 
05:29:44.990 --> 05:29:45.000 align:start position:0%
um what what people choose to celebrate
 
05:29:48.230 --> 05:29:48.240 align:start position:0%
is their business and so
 
05:29:49.550 --> 05:29:49.560 align:start position:0%
um I think that representative
 
05:29:52.610 --> 05:29:52.620 align:start position:0%
petrigno's testimony and then especially
 
05:29:56.390 --> 05:29:56.400 align:start position:0%
representative O'Brien's comments about
 
05:29:56.400 --> 05:29:58.010 align:start position:0%
representative O'Brien's comments about
um

05:29:58.010 --> 05:29:58.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:30:03.050 --> 05:30:03.060 align:start position:0%
about what the real start of of
 
05:30:06.708 --> 05:30:06.718 align:start position:0%
um the day was about and and the fact
 
05:30:09.410 --> 05:30:09.420 align:start position:0%
that it started in the north end with a
 
05:30:13.610 --> 05:30:13.620 align:start position:0%
a horrible horrible bigoted hate kind of
 
05:30:15.590 --> 05:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
situation so
 
05:30:16.788 --> 05:30:16.798 align:start position:0%
um I really appreciate all the work
 
05:30:18.830 --> 05:30:18.840 align:start position:0%
everybody's done and I strongly support
 
05:30:20.990 --> 05:30:21.000 align:start position:0%
this all right thank you representative
 
05:30:22.970 --> 05:30:22.980 align:start position:0%
Dolan yes thank you madam chair I'm
 
05:30:25.250 --> 05:30:25.260 align:start position:0%
going to be supporting the amendment uh
 
05:30:29.150 --> 05:30:29.160 align:start position:0%
but I I believe that the bill ought to
 
05:30:31.310 --> 05:30:31.320 align:start position:0%
be ideal
 
05:30:33.470 --> 05:30:33.480 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
05:30:35.990 --> 05:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt
 
05:30:38.390 --> 05:30:38.400 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair well I've only
 
05:30:40.430 --> 05:30:40.440 align:start position:0%
been to Italy one time and it was just
 
05:30:43.610 --> 05:30:43.620 align:start position:0%
nipping down in the in the in the corner
 
05:30:46.670 --> 05:30:46.680 align:start position:0%
and wasn't able to to visit any of the
 
05:30:49.550 --> 05:30:49.560 align:start position:0%
fabulous cities of of Italy
 
05:30:52.190 --> 05:30:52.200 align:start position:0%
um I certainly have seen plenty of
 
05:30:52.200 --> 05:30:53.150 align:start position:0%
um I certainly have seen plenty of
um

05:30:53.150 --> 05:30:53.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:30:56.890 --> 05:30:56.900 align:start position:0%
plenty of pictures of you know
 
05:31:00.230 --> 05:31:00.240 align:start position:0%
Milano and many of the other great
 
05:31:02.050 --> 05:31:02.060 align:start position:0%
cities of of
 
05:31:05.270 --> 05:31:05.280 align:start position:0%
Italy and so forth and and you only have
 
05:31:07.788 --> 05:31:07.798 align:start position:0%
to if you can even stand
 
05:31:10.208 --> 05:31:10.218 align:start position:0%
Opera at all
 
05:31:13.430 --> 05:31:13.440 align:start position:0%
and you've heard any of the operas of
 
05:31:13.440 --> 05:31:14.650 align:start position:0%
and you've heard any of the operas of
Verdi

05:31:14.650 --> 05:31:14.660 align:start position:0%
Verdi
 
05:31:19.850 --> 05:31:19.860 align:start position:0%
Aida and you know so many others as a
 
05:31:24.050 --> 05:31:24.060 align:start position:0%
singer myself I've performed the manzoni
 
05:31:27.010 --> 05:31:27.020 align:start position:0%
Requiem by PRD and a number of other
 
05:31:29.230 --> 05:31:29.240 align:start position:0%
works of his
 
05:31:33.850 --> 05:31:33.860 align:start position:0%
and the great Italian sculptors painters
 
05:31:36.890 --> 05:31:36.900 align:start position:0%
and when you think that the initial
 
05:31:40.330 --> 05:31:40.340 align:start position:0%
purpose of Columbus Day was to
 
05:31:43.910 --> 05:31:43.920 align:start position:0%
rehabilitate the reputation of Italians
 
05:31:45.830 --> 05:31:45.840 align:start position:0%
at a time when they were under
 
05:31:49.010 --> 05:31:49.020 align:start position:0%
considerable assault in areas of this
 
05:31:51.530 --> 05:31:51.540 align:start position:0%
country and Columbus was somebody
 
05:31:53.510 --> 05:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
everybody had heard of even if he'd
 
05:31:55.730 --> 05:31:55.740 align:start position:0%
never been to this to the American
 
05:31:55.740 --> 05:31:58.990 align:start position:0%
never been to this to the American
Shores

05:31:58.990 --> 05:31:59.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:02.628 --> 05:32:02.638 align:start position:0%
so I think the idea of Italian Heritage
 
05:32:04.190 --> 05:32:04.200 align:start position:0%
is something that if you don't know
 
05:32:07.550 --> 05:32:07.560 align:start position:0%
enough about it yet uh well you can
 
05:32:10.430 --> 05:32:10.440 align:start position:0%
start with pizza anyway in spaghetti I
 
05:32:12.350 --> 05:32:12.360 align:start position:0%
can you can always make me happy by
 
05:32:14.570 --> 05:32:14.580 align:start position:0%
inviting me for a spaghetti dinner or
 
05:32:18.170 --> 05:32:18.180 align:start position:0%
pizza so I I think this is as
 
05:32:20.570 --> 05:32:20.580 align:start position:0%
representative O'Brien said a moment ago
 
05:32:22.910 --> 05:32:22.920 align:start position:0%
in Olive Branch in the direction of
 
05:32:24.948 --> 05:32:24.958 align:start position:0%
getting out from underneath the idea of
 
05:32:27.410 --> 05:32:27.420 align:start position:0%
trading Columbus Day for indigenous
 
05:32:30.110 --> 05:32:30.120 align:start position:0%
peoples day and it's a step in the right
 
05:32:31.910 --> 05:32:31.920 align:start position:0%
direction so I'm going to be voting yes
 
05:32:34.670 --> 05:32:34.680 align:start position:0%
thank you yes representative Gould and
 
05:32:37.310 --> 05:32:37.320 align:start position:0%
let me just say that um President Biden
 
05:32:39.350 --> 05:32:39.360 align:start position:0%
this year declared both indigenous
 
05:32:43.368 --> 05:32:43.378 align:start position:0%
people's day and Columbus Day for that
 
05:32:46.010 --> 05:32:46.020 align:start position:0%
Tuesday in October and certainly we all
 
05:32:47.810 --> 05:32:47.820 align:start position:0%
know as indigenous people or as
 
05:32:49.610 --> 05:32:49.620 align:start position:0%
Abernathy people we can go to the
 
05:32:51.530 --> 05:32:51.540 align:start position:0%
governor and ask for Proclamation
 
05:32:53.750 --> 05:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in this action we're
 
05:32:57.590 --> 05:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
taking today that prohibits or goes
 
05:32:59.930 --> 05:32:59.940 align:start position:0%
against all the towns and municipalities
 
05:33:02.448 --> 05:33:02.458 align:start position:0%
that have chosen to celebrate indigenous
 
05:33:04.310 --> 05:33:04.320 align:start position:0%
people's day
 
05:33:06.050 --> 05:33:06.060 align:start position:0%
good good to know anyone else
 
05:33:07.850 --> 05:33:07.860 align:start position:0%
representative Simon
 
05:33:09.890 --> 05:33:09.900 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I don't have any
 
05:33:11.690 --> 05:33:11.700 align:start position:0%
particular malice towards the amendment
 
05:33:13.490 --> 05:33:13.500 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if I'll support it yet or
 
05:33:16.190 --> 05:33:16.200 align:start position:0%
not I'm still thinking about it some of
 
05:33:18.410 --> 05:33:18.420 align:start position:0%
my concerns are just by moving in the
 
05:33:19.788 --> 05:33:19.798 align:start position:0%
direction of changing Columbus Day to
 
05:33:21.948 --> 05:33:21.958 align:start position:0%
Italian Heritage day
 
05:33:21.958 --> 05:33:23.270 align:start position:0%
Italian Heritage day
um

05:33:23.270 --> 05:33:23.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:33:25.550 --> 05:33:25.560 align:start position:0%
I guess it opened like representative
 
05:33:27.530 --> 05:33:27.540 align:start position:0%
O'Brien said should we change St Patty's
 
05:33:30.170 --> 05:33:30.180 align:start position:0%
Day to Irish heritage celebration day I
 
05:33:31.550 --> 05:33:31.560 align:start position:0%
didn't think you'd be as excited about
 
05:33:31.560 --> 05:33:32.390 align:start position:0%
didn't think you'd be as excited about
that

05:33:32.390 --> 05:33:32.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:33:33.890 --> 05:33:33.900 align:start position:0%
um I also just wonder we you know
 
05:33:35.208 --> 05:33:35.218 align:start position:0%
obviously I have a great deal of respect
 
05:33:35.218 --> 05:33:36.590 align:start position:0%
obviously I have a great deal of respect
for

05:33:36.590 --> 05:33:36.600 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:33:38.628 --> 05:33:38.638 align:start position:0%
um all of the Italian members of the
 
05:33:39.830 --> 05:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
United States of America and the state
 
05:33:41.090 --> 05:33:41.100 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire
 
05:33:43.368 --> 05:33:43.378 align:start position:0%
um but we are representative of just
 
05:33:46.730 --> 05:33:46.740 align:start position:0%
about every nation on the planet and if
 
05:33:50.090 --> 05:33:50.100 align:start position:0%
we start naming things after countries
 
05:33:52.010 --> 05:33:52.020 align:start position:0%
Heritage days
 
05:33:54.470 --> 05:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
um I think we open up a whole slew of
 
05:33:56.030 --> 05:33:56.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity for
 
05:33:58.430 --> 05:33:58.440 align:start position:0%
um where's my Lebanese Heritage day and
 
05:34:01.310 --> 05:34:01.320 align:start position:0%
where's my French heritage day
 
05:34:01.320 --> 05:34:02.030 align:start position:0%
where's my French heritage day
um

05:34:02.030 --> 05:34:02.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:34:04.788 --> 05:34:04.798 align:start position:0%
so that that is uh so one of the
 
05:34:06.708 --> 05:34:06.718 align:start position:0%
concerns that I have uh with going in
 
05:34:08.390 --> 05:34:08.400 align:start position:0%
this direction uh my other concern to
 
05:34:12.288 --> 05:34:12.298 align:start position:0%
representative leikis's comments is I
 
05:34:13.368 --> 05:34:13.378 align:start position:0%
don't think this will actually
 
05:34:13.378 --> 05:34:14.690 align:start position:0%
don't think this will actually
ameliorate

05:34:14.690 --> 05:34:14.700 align:start position:0%
ameliorate
 
05:34:16.430 --> 05:34:16.440 align:start position:0%
um them from coming back again I I think
 
05:34:17.390 --> 05:34:17.400 align:start position:0%
they're looking for something very
 
05:34:18.830 --> 05:34:18.840 align:start position:0%
specific and they're very passionate
 
05:34:20.270 --> 05:34:20.280 align:start position:0%
about it and I think they'll return even
 
05:34:21.650 --> 05:34:21.660 align:start position:0%
if we do this
 
05:34:22.850 --> 05:34:22.860 align:start position:0%
um because they're looking for the
 
05:34:24.470 --> 05:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
indigenous people's day to be codified
 
05:34:24.480 --> 05:34:25.730 align:start position:0%
indigenous people's day to be codified
so

05:34:25.730 --> 05:34:25.740 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:34:26.930 --> 05:34:26.940 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure that it fixes that
 
05:34:28.310 --> 05:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
problem and I think it opens us up to
 
05:34:30.170 --> 05:34:30.180 align:start position:0%
potentially other problems as well so
 
05:34:30.180 --> 05:34:32.030 align:start position:0%
potentially other problems as well so
representative

05:34:32.030 --> 05:34:32.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:34:33.590 --> 05:34:33.600 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
05:34:36.288 --> 05:34:36.298 align:start position:0%
my my main concern with this is really
 
05:34:37.730 --> 05:34:37.740 align:start position:0%
just having the government dictate
 
05:34:39.770 --> 05:34:39.780 align:start position:0%
what's a holiday anyway when really a
 
05:34:41.690 --> 05:34:41.700 align:start position:0%
holiday is a holy day and I think that's
 
05:34:44.208 --> 05:34:44.218 align:start position:0%
kind of a personal decision so to go to
 
05:34:45.890 --> 05:34:45.900 align:start position:0%
the people with the guns and say we want
 
05:34:47.690 --> 05:34:47.700 align:start position:0%
this to be the official holy day I think
 
05:34:49.368 --> 05:34:49.378 align:start position:0%
is kind of getting into weird territory
 
05:34:52.070 --> 05:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
but on the federal level I always tend
 
05:34:55.368 --> 05:34:55.378 align:start position:0%
to end up there the we are up to now 44
 
05:34:58.310 --> 05:34:58.320 align:start position:0%
paid days for federal employees for all
 
05:35:01.128 --> 05:35:01.138 align:start position:0%
the various holidays and I just
 
05:35:03.110 --> 05:35:03.120 align:start position:0%
I think we've kind of gone over my point
 
05:35:04.970 --> 05:35:04.980 align:start position:0%
being there's a point is I just don't
 
05:35:06.110 --> 05:35:06.120 align:start position:0%
want to see New Hampshire end up
 
05:35:08.090 --> 05:35:08.100 align:start position:0%
following the same route where we end up
 
05:35:10.310 --> 05:35:10.320 align:start position:0%
with more paid days and work days
 
05:35:13.368 --> 05:35:13.378 align:start position:0%
column this first of all even for the
 
05:35:15.770 --> 05:35:15.780 align:start position:0%
the government holidays are not
 
05:35:17.868 --> 05:35:17.878 align:start position:0%
necessarily paid days off
 
05:35:17.878 --> 05:35:19.730 align:start position:0%
necessarily paid days off
and

05:35:19.730 --> 05:35:19.740 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:35:22.550 --> 05:35:22.560 align:start position:0%
um Columbus Day is in fact a Federal
 
05:35:25.850 --> 05:35:25.860 align:start position:0%
holiday under that name
 
05:35:27.890 --> 05:35:27.900 align:start position:0%
yes follow-up follow-up this is actually
 
05:35:29.810 --> 05:35:29.820 align:start position:0%
from a Forbes article and the quote was
 
05:35:31.970 --> 05:35:31.980 align:start position:0%
this makes 44 paid days off the average
 
05:35:33.770 --> 05:35:33.780 align:start position:0%
federal employee annually which is
 
05:35:35.750 --> 05:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
nearly nine full weeks of paid time off
 
05:35:38.090 --> 05:35:38.100 align:start position:0%
each year so
 
05:35:40.430 --> 05:35:40.440 align:start position:0%
okay a representative wrote it and then
 
05:35:45.910 --> 05:35:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:48.830 --> 05:35:48.840 align:start position:0%
I just want people to understand this is
 
05:35:50.390 --> 05:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
not complicated
 
05:35:53.030 --> 05:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
we are just codifying what we are
 
05:35:55.368 --> 05:35:55.378 align:start position:0%
actually doing we're not adding any
 
05:35:58.128 --> 05:35:58.138 align:start position:0%
holidays we're not changing anything
 
05:36:01.250 --> 05:36:01.260 align:start position:0%
other than the name of the day to
 
05:36:04.850 --> 05:36:04.860 align:start position:0%
represent what people are actually doing
 
05:36:07.010 --> 05:36:07.020 align:start position:0%
they are celebrating their Italian
 
05:36:10.788 --> 05:36:10.798 align:start position:0%
Heritage and we are codifying that by
 
05:36:14.510 --> 05:36:14.520 align:start position:0%
changing the name of the day that's it
 
05:36:17.208 --> 05:36:17.218 align:start position:0%
okay representative yep ditto it doesn't
 
05:36:19.550 --> 05:36:19.560 align:start position:0%
add nobody gets another day off with
 
05:36:19.560 --> 05:36:23.628 align:start position:0%
add nobody gets another day off with
this

05:36:23.628 --> 05:36:23.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:25.730 --> 05:36:25.740 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
05:36:28.070 --> 05:36:28.080 align:start position:0%
I can remember back in my youth
 
05:36:31.010 --> 05:36:31.020 align:start position:0%
uh listening to uh Mao Zedong give a
 
05:36:31.020 --> 05:36:33.050 align:start position:0%
uh listening to uh Mao Zedong give a
speech

05:36:33.050 --> 05:36:33.060 align:start position:0%
speech
 
05:36:35.150 --> 05:36:35.160 align:start position:0%
and I'm paraphrasing because my Mandarin
 
05:36:37.070 --> 05:36:37.080 align:start position:0%
is really really rough
 
05:36:40.128 --> 05:36:40.138 align:start position:0%
but he was saying that for their
 
05:36:41.990 --> 05:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
cultural revolution they had to get rid
 
05:36:44.330 --> 05:36:44.340 align:start position:0%
of the four holes
 
05:36:47.330 --> 05:36:47.340 align:start position:0%
uh I think it was the old ways the old
 
05:36:47.340 --> 05:36:48.530 align:start position:0%
uh I think it was the old ways the old
customs

05:36:48.530 --> 05:36:48.540 align:start position:0%
customs
 
05:36:55.070 --> 05:36:55.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:57.050 --> 05:36:57.060 align:start position:0%
and that is what that's why I don't
 
05:36:58.788 --> 05:36:58.798 align:start position:0%
support the amendment I don't support
 
05:37:00.050 --> 05:37:00.060 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
05:37:02.750 --> 05:37:02.760 align:start position:0%
because that's what I see this as
 
05:37:06.230 --> 05:37:06.240 align:start position:0%
a continuation of Erasure
 
05:37:08.390 --> 05:37:08.400 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
05:37:09.830 --> 05:37:09.840 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
05:37:12.050 --> 05:37:12.060 align:start position:0%
I like to say that I'm opposed to it
 
05:37:15.530 --> 05:37:15.540 align:start position:0%
because I think Columbus accomplished a
 
05:37:17.930 --> 05:37:17.940 align:start position:0%
great deal and regardless of his
 
05:37:20.570 --> 05:37:20.580 align:start position:0%
personal moral failings
 
05:37:24.110 --> 05:37:24.120 align:start position:0%
he changed the history of the world and
 
05:37:26.690 --> 05:37:26.700 align:start position:0%
I think that's worthy of note
 
05:37:30.170 --> 05:37:30.180 align:start position:0%
so I'm I'm not not in support
 
05:37:32.270 --> 05:37:32.280 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
05:37:34.850 --> 05:37:34.860 align:start position:0%

assumed it was in English so that's it
 
05:41:17.690 --> 05:41:17.700 align:start position:0%
all right the motion the motion passes
 
05:41:21.170 --> 05:41:21.180 align:start position:0%
13 to 7. so that will go on the regular
 
05:41:21.180 --> 05:41:22.610 align:start position:0%
13 to 7. so that will go on the regular
calendar

05:41:22.610 --> 05:41:22.620 align:start position:0%
calendar
 
05:41:26.030 --> 05:41:26.040 align:start position:0%

05:41:47.218 --> 05:41:49.070 align:start position:0%
I think that's the last we have to do
and

05:41:49.070 --> 05:41:49.080 align:start position:0%

05:42:08.208 --> 05:42:08.218 align:start position:0%
and House Bill 258 will be exact at some
 
05:42:10.670 --> 05:42:10.680 align:start position:0%
point I believe we have to make it a
 
05:42:12.770 --> 05:42:12.780 align:start position:0%
Time known so I'll put it on the 15th
 
05:42:15.410 --> 05:42:15.420 align:start position:0%
