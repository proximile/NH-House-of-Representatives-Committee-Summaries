00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 align:start position:0%
so last time we were here about a month
 
00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.110 align:start position:0%
so last time we were here about a month
ago

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 align:start position:0%
ago
 
00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 align:start position:0%
um i i went through
 
00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:51.519 align:start position:0%
in quite a bit of detail the the
 
00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:52.710 align:start position:0%
in quite a bit of detail the the
documents

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 align:start position:0%
documents
 
00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 align:start position:0%
before you um that set up the claims
 
00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:57.519 align:start position:0%
process and and settlement guidelines
 
00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 align:start position:0%
for the ydc settlement fund i thought
 
00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 align:start position:0%
what would be helpful this morning is to
 
00:04:04.869 --> 00:04:04.879 align:start position:0%
to walk through the changes we've made
 
00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 align:start position:0%
um after our discussion with the
 
00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 align:start position:0%
committee on august 10th and also after
 
00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 align:start position:0%
our discussions that we've had with
 
00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:14.239 align:start position:0%
claimants council since the last meeting
 
00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 align:start position:0%
most of the documents are the same but
 
00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 align:start position:0%
we've made some some key changes that i
 
00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:20.079 align:start position:0%
want to walk through and then i'm happy
 
00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:20.789 align:start position:0%
want to walk through and then i'm happy
to

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 align:start position:0%
to take questions either on the changes
 
00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 align:start position:0%
or of course on any of the substance of
 
00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 align:start position:0%
the documents
 
00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 align:start position:0%
so what we did after the last meeting we
 
00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 align:start position:0%
we went back and we first cataloged all
 
00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:35.040 align:start position:0%
of the comments we got from the
 
00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:37.280 align:start position:0%
committee just to try to make sure that
 
00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 align:start position:0%
we had captured all of the feedback
 
00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:42.400 align:start position:0%
um that you all had provided to us and
 
00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:45.040 align:start position:0%
we also have had some pretty extensive
 
00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 align:start position:0%
conversations with with claimants
 
00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.030 align:start position:0%
conversations with with claimants
council

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:49.040 align:start position:0%
council
 
00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 align:start position:0%
not specifically with nixon peabody
 
00:04:53.749 --> 00:04:53.759 align:start position:0%
they they've generally chosen not to
 
00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080 align:start position:0%
engage in the process but we have had
 
00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.000 align:start position:0%
some very productive conversations with
 
00:04:59.590 --> 00:04:59.600 align:start position:0%
other claimants council
 
00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240 align:start position:0%
since since the last meeting and i think
 
00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 align:start position:0%
that we have reached a good compromise
 
00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:08.560 align:start position:0%
on some changes and i think that
 
00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:10.000 align:start position:0%
you know i feel comfortable sitting here
 
00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:11.440 align:start position:0%
today telling you that we have an
 
00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:13.919 align:start position:0%
indication both from claimants counsel
 
00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:14.960 align:start position:0%
who have written letters to the
 
00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:17.120 align:start position:0%
committee and also other claimants
 
00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:18.070 align:start position:0%
committee and also other claimants
counsel

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:18.080 align:start position:0%
counsel
 
00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
who may not have written letters but
 
00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:22.400 align:start position:0%
have indicated that they have clients
 
00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240 align:start position:0%
who they believe will participate in
 
00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:26.080 align:start position:0%
this process i think the general
 
00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:27.270 align:start position:0%
this process i think the general
feedback

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:27.280 align:start position:0%
feedback
 
00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:29.120 align:start position:0%
from many of the claimants council out
 
00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:31.600 align:start position:0%
there is that this process is not
 
00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:33.520 align:start position:0%
perfect and we of course would never
 
00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:35.680 align:start position:0%
claim it would be but
 
00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:37.280 align:start position:0%
we believe that many claimants counsel
 
00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:39.600 align:start position:0%
now feel that this will be workable for
 
00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:42.400 align:start position:0%
many clients who are out there
 
00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:44.639 align:start position:0%
so that that is generally i think where
 
00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:46.320 align:start position:0%
we sit here today but i will walk
 
00:05:47.749 --> 00:05:47.759 align:start position:0%
through some of the
 
00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:50.479 align:start position:0%
some of the specific changes we've made
 
00:05:51.909 --> 00:05:51.919 align:start position:0%
actually before i do that one thing i
 
00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
also want to add is that we've had
 
00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
productive discussions with claimants
 
00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:58.240 align:start position:0%
council about who the administrator
 
00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:00.160 align:start position:0%
might be and while you know we're not
 
00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:02.960 align:start position:0%
prepared to name names publicly today
 
00:06:04.469 --> 00:06:04.479 align:start position:0%
i think that we have a good
 
00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:06.240 align:start position:0%
understanding between our office and
 
00:06:07.749 --> 00:06:07.759 align:start position:0%
claimants council on who would make a
 
00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:09.520 align:start position:0%
good administrator and i'm confident
 
00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:11.840 align:start position:0%
that if this process is approved we will
 
00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:14.080 align:start position:0%
be able to come to agreement on who the
 
00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:16.960 align:start position:0%
administrator will be very quickly and i
 
00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
think that will be important as this
 
00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:20.880 align:start position:0%
process moves forward if it gets
 
00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:22.880 align:start position:0%
approved because once this committee
 
00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:25.120 align:start position:0%
approves this process
 
00:06:27.029 --> 00:06:27.039 align:start position:0%
if the committee approves the process
 
00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:29.360 align:start position:0%
and once the administrator is appointed
 
00:06:31.029 --> 00:06:31.039 align:start position:0%
the administrator will sort of take
 
00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:32.720 align:start position:0%
control of this process and it will be
 
00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:34.560 align:start position:0%
the administrator who
 
00:06:36.629 --> 00:06:36.639 align:start position:0%
can come back to request changes from
 
00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
the committee i think that's an
 
00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:39.840 align:start position:0%
important thing to keep in mind as we
 
00:06:41.749 --> 00:06:41.759 align:start position:0%
walk through the documents today because
 
00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:43.840 align:start position:0%
the administrator
 
00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:45.280 align:start position:0%
will be
 
00:06:47.909 --> 00:06:47.919 align:start position:0%
i think seen by many claimants as a more
 
00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:49.280 align:start position:0%
neutral party
 
00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:06:52.469 --> 00:06:52.479 align:start position:0%
the fact that the administrator will
 
00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:54.720 align:start position:0%
sort of take control of this process and
 
00:06:56.309 --> 00:06:56.319 align:start position:0%
take control of requesting future
 
00:06:58.790 --> 00:06:58.800 align:start position:0%
changes should give some comfort to
 
00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:01.360 align:start position:0%
those who who may still feel that there
 
00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:02.960 align:start position:0%
are some tweaks that can be made as we
 
00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:04.400 align:start position:0%
go forward and as we see how this
 
00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:07.280 align:start position:0%
process is implemented
 
00:07:09.589 --> 00:07:09.599 align:start position:0%
so with that i'll walk through the
 
00:07:11.189 --> 00:07:11.199 align:start position:0%
changes we've made since the last
 
00:07:11.199 --> 00:07:12.230 align:start position:0%
changes we've made since the last
meeting

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:12.240 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:14.560 align:start position:0%
the first overall change we made based
 
00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:16.160 align:start position:0%
on i think feedback from representative
 
00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
emmerich was to split the documents into
 
00:07:20.629 --> 00:07:20.639 align:start position:0%
separate documents
 
00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:22.960 align:start position:0%
uh it was always our intention for these
 
00:07:25.189 --> 00:07:25.199 align:start position:0%
documents to be presented to claimants
 
00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:27.840 align:start position:0%
as separate documents but i think
 
00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
presenting them to the committee as
 
00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
separate documents is helpful in seeing
 
00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:34.000 align:start position:0%
what this looks like if each document
 
00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
stands on its own
 
00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:39.360 align:start position:0%
so last time we had three documents that
 
00:07:41.189 --> 00:07:41.199 align:start position:0%
were packaged together
 
00:07:43.189 --> 00:07:43.199 align:start position:0%
you now have four documents in front of
 
00:07:45.589 --> 00:07:45.599 align:start position:0%
you because we added a notice document
 
00:07:47.189 --> 00:07:47.199 align:start position:0%
based on feedback that we got at the
 
00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:49.280 align:start position:0%
last meeting i'll walk through that when
 
00:07:50.869 --> 00:07:50.879 align:start position:0%
i get to it but i thought it would be
 
00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:52.000 align:start position:0%
most helpful to walk through the
 
00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:57.189 --> 00:07:57.199 align:start position:0%
so the first document that you have in
 
00:08:03.029 --> 00:08:03.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:05.440 align:start position:0%
this as we discussed last time is the
 
00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:08.960 align:start position:0%
claims process document
 
00:08:10.629 --> 00:08:10.639 align:start position:0%
as we talked about at the last meeting
 
00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:12.800 align:start position:0%
the claims process document is really
 
00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:14.400 align:start position:0%
meant to be
 
00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
sort of the the governing document for
 
00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:19.680 align:start position:0%
for the settlement process it's the
 
00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:21.680 align:start position:0%
rules of the road if you will
 
00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:22.550 align:start position:0%
rules of the road if you will
so

00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:25.280 align:start position:0%
the claimant themselves will not have to
 
00:08:27.909 --> 00:08:27.919 align:start position:0%
go through and digest the claims process
 
00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
document the claims process document is
 
00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:32.800 align:start position:0%
really for the administrator and the
 
00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:34.800 align:start position:0%
attorneys who are involved
 
00:08:37.509 --> 00:08:37.519 align:start position:0%
because it's it's the rules or put
 
00:08:39.829 --> 00:08:39.839 align:start position:0%
another way the law that will govern the
 
00:08:41.509 --> 00:08:41.519 align:start position:0%
settlement process
 
00:08:44.149 --> 00:08:44.159 align:start position:0%
when and if it's approved
 
00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:47.120 align:start position:0%
so we made a couple changes to this
 
00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:49.440 align:start position:0%
this document not anything major because
 
00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:50.800 align:start position:0%
most of the feedback was on other
 
00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:53.200 align:start position:0%
documents but the first change
 
00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:54.480 align:start position:0%
that we made
 
00:08:58.550 --> 00:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
based on feedback at the last meeting
 
00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:05.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:07.509 --> 00:09:07.519 align:start position:0%
this is the section of the process
 
00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:10.160 align:start position:0%
regarding notice to claimants of what
 
00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
their options are after they get a
 
00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:17.120 align:start position:0%
proposed award from the aeg designee
 
00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:19.120 align:start position:0%
if the claimant does not
 
00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:20.630 align:start position:0%
if the claimant does not
agree

00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
agree
 
00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:22.800 align:start position:0%
with the ag designee's position or
 
00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:24.070 align:start position:0%
with the ag designee's position or
proposal

00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:24.080 align:start position:0%
proposal
 
00:09:25.269 --> 00:09:25.279 align:start position:0%
or actually i should say when the
 
00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
claimant gets the ag designee's position
 
00:09:28.949 --> 00:09:28.959 align:start position:0%
or proposal
 
00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
the claimant has the option of accepting
 
00:09:33.829 --> 00:09:33.839 align:start position:0%
that position
 
00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:36.800 align:start position:0%
um of requesting that the
 
00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
the process go to the administrator so
 
00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
that a proceeding be scheduled in front
 
00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:42.160 align:start position:0%
of the administrator
 
00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:43.680 align:start position:0%
and then the third option the claimant
 
00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
has is to withdraw their claim from
 
00:09:47.829 --> 00:09:47.839 align:start position:0%
further processing and we just wanted to
 
00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:50.320 align:start position:0%
make clear that if that happens the
 
00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:52.880 align:start position:0%
claimant can then proceed with any
 
00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:54.560 align:start position:0%
pending litigation
 
00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:56.240 align:start position:0%
the reason this clarification was
 
00:09:58.870 --> 00:09:58.880 align:start position:0%
important is that if a claimant enters
 
00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:00.240 align:start position:0%
this process
 
00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:02.480 align:start position:0%
and they've already filed a lawsuit they
 
00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:04.640 align:start position:0%
would have been required to sign an
 
00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
agreement to stay that lawsuit while
 
00:10:09.509 --> 00:10:09.519 align:start position:0%
they go through this process so we
 
00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:11.200 align:start position:0%
wanted to make clear that as part of
 
00:10:13.509 --> 00:10:13.519 align:start position:0%
option three as part of withdrawing
 
00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:15.680 align:start position:0%
their claim from this process they can
 
00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:17.680 align:start position:0%
continue with their litigation so we
 
00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:20.160 align:start position:0%
just clarified that at the top of page
 
00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:22.949 align:start position:0%
just clarified that at the top of page
10.

00:10:22.949 --> 00:10:22.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:24.560 align:start position:0%
another clarification we made in the
 
00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:26.720 align:start position:0%
claims process document and we made this
 
00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:28.640 align:start position:0%
clarification throughout the various
 
00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:29.990 align:start position:0%
clarification throughout the various
documents

00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
documents
 
00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:38.160 align:start position:0%
and this is where we defined
 
00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
former ydc resident we just wanted to
 
00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:42.320 align:start position:0%
make clear that
 
00:10:44.069 --> 00:10:44.079 align:start position:0%
a current resident
 
00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
is considered a former ydc resident for
 
00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:48.560 align:start position:0%
purposes of the statute
 
00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:50.720 align:start position:0%
because the statute defines a ydc
 
00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:53.200 align:start position:0%
resident as someone who resided at ydc
 
00:10:57.350 --> 00:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
so for example if someone on a say a
 
00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:03.360 align:start position:0%
current ydc resident on a tuesday claims
 
00:11:05.269 --> 00:11:05.279 align:start position:0%
they suffered abuse either earlier that
 
00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:08.480 align:start position:0%
day or the day before they they fall
 
00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:10.160 align:start position:0%
into this definition and so they they
 
00:11:12.829 --> 00:11:12.839 align:start position:0%
could use this
 
00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:15.040 align:start position:0%
process and then there's one additional
 
00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
change we made this was based on
 
00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:18.240 align:start position:0%
discussion with claimants council and i
 
00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:20.160 align:start position:0%
apologize i went out of order but this
 
00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:30.949 --> 00:11:30.959 align:start position:0%
it's about the middle of page 16 section
 
00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
27. this is the language that deals with
 
00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:36.160 align:start position:0%
attorneys fees and costs we wanted to
 
00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:38.720 align:start position:0%
just simplify this language a bit
 
00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:39.910 align:start position:0%
just simplify this language a bit
um

00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:39.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
the statute provides that the the
 
00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
the top attorney fee award can be no
 
00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:48.640 align:start position:0%
more than 33.3 percent
 
00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:51.120 align:start position:0%
and rather than have a number of factors
 
00:11:53.509 --> 00:11:53.519 align:start position:0%
that the administrator weighs we just we
 
00:11:56.069 --> 00:11:56.079 align:start position:0%
figured it would be easier to note that
 
00:11:57.990 --> 00:11:58.000 align:start position:0%
the administrator can take into account
 
00:12:00.069 --> 00:12:00.079 align:start position:0%
a fee agreement that a
 
00:12:02.069 --> 00:12:02.079 align:start position:0%
claimant might have with their lawyer
 
00:12:04.389 --> 00:12:04.399 align:start position:0%
and that the administrator should just
 
00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:06.880 align:start position:0%
review an attorney fee request to ensure
 
00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:09.200 align:start position:0%
that it complies with new hampshire rule
 
00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:12.160 align:start position:0%
of professional conduct 1.5 because that
 
00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:16.480 align:start position:0%
that rule already governs attorneys um
 
00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:18.720 align:start position:0%
governs attorneys on on what fee they
 
00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
might take especially if it's a
 
00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:21.920 align:start position:0%
contingency fee and that rule is meant
 
00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
to ensure that that fees are reasonable
 
00:12:25.509 --> 00:12:25.519 align:start position:0%
so we thought it would make more sense
 
00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
to tie that type of review
 
00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:31.680 align:start position:0%
to rule 1.5 than to try to have some
 
00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:33.760 align:start position:0%
you know different standard that might
 
00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
be separate from that or have factors
 
00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:38.800 align:start position:0%
that are separate from that
 
00:12:40.389 --> 00:12:40.399 align:start position:0%
so those are the changes we made in the
 
00:12:42.389 --> 00:12:42.399 align:start position:0%
claims process document
 
00:12:44.389 --> 00:12:44.399 align:start position:0%
again this these were based on feedback
 
00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:46.160 align:start position:0%
from the committee and also feedback
 
00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:47.670 align:start position:0%
from the committee and also feedback
from

00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:47.680 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:12:52.310 --> 00:12:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:53.829 --> 00:12:53.839 align:start position:0%
the next document that you have in front
 
00:12:56.550 --> 00:12:56.560 align:start position:0%
of you is a new document and it's fairly
 
00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:59.110 align:start position:0%
of you is a new document and it's fairly
short

00:12:59.110 --> 00:12:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:00.800 align:start position:0%
but this is
 
00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:05.990 align:start position:0%
but this is
fis-22-308

00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:07.829 --> 00:13:07.839 align:start position:0%
and this is an additional document we
 
00:13:07.839 --> 00:13:09.509 align:start position:0%
and this is an additional document we
added

00:13:09.509 --> 00:13:09.519 align:start position:0%
added
 
00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:14.560 align:start position:0%
at the last meeting of the fiscal
 
00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
committee and based on conversations
 
00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:18.560 align:start position:0%
with claimants council we received
 
00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:20.560 align:start position:0%
feedback that
 
00:13:22.949 --> 00:13:22.959 align:start position:0%
we really needed to beef up
 
00:13:24.949 --> 00:13:24.959 align:start position:0%
the notice section a bit to make sure
 
00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:26.560 align:start position:0%
that we were we were going to be doing
 
00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
everything we can that the administrator
 
00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
would do everything they can
 
00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
to provide notice to any potential
 
00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:34.880 align:start position:0%
claimants that might be out there
 
00:13:37.269 --> 00:13:37.279 align:start position:0%
so this document what this document does
 
00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:40.240 align:start position:0%
is provide guidance to the administrator
 
00:13:41.829 --> 00:13:41.839 align:start position:0%
on providing notice to potential
 
00:13:41.839 --> 00:13:43.189 align:start position:0%
on providing notice to potential
claimants

00:13:43.189 --> 00:13:43.199 align:start position:0%
claimants
 
00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
and it covers mechanisms that were
 
00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
already covered in the statute
 
00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:49.040 align:start position:0%
so the mechanisms that were already
 
00:13:50.629 --> 00:13:50.639 align:start position:0%
covered in the statute were notice in
 
00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:53.600 align:start position:0%
newspapers notice on social media
 
00:13:55.269 --> 00:13:55.279 align:start position:0%
postings at correctional facilities
 
00:13:59.110 --> 00:13:59.120 align:start position:0%
press releases and website postings
 
00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:01.680 align:start position:0%
and based on discussions with claimants
 
00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:02.629 align:start position:0%
and based on discussions with claimants
counsel

00:14:02.629 --> 00:14:02.639 align:start position:0%
counsel
 
00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
and based on discussions discussions at
 
00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:06.560 align:start position:0%
the last fiscal committee meeting we
 
00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
talked about how it would also be
 
00:14:09.829 --> 00:14:09.839 align:start position:0%
helpful to post notice
 
00:14:12.389 --> 00:14:12.399 align:start position:0%
in courthouses and in clerks offices
 
00:14:14.069 --> 00:14:14.079 align:start position:0%
in community mental health center
 
00:14:17.269 --> 00:14:17.279 align:start position:0%
centers and where we can in private
 
00:14:19.189 --> 00:14:19.199 align:start position:0%
offices of mental uh private mental
 
00:14:21.269 --> 00:14:21.279 align:start position:0%
health practitioners
 
00:14:23.269 --> 00:14:23.279 align:start position:0%
so the idea being that we want to try to
 
00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:26.160 align:start position:0%
cover any potential place where
 
00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:28.000 align:start position:0%
someone who who might be a potential
 
00:14:29.189 --> 00:14:29.199 align:start position:0%
claimant that would go through this
 
00:14:29.199 --> 00:14:30.550 align:start position:0%
claimant that would go through this
process

00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:30.560 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:37.189 --> 00:14:37.199 align:start position:0%
so we expect that the administrator will
 
00:14:37.199 --> 00:14:38.470 align:start position:0%
so we expect that the administrator will
also

00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:38.480 align:start position:0%
also
 
00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
you know when when that person is
 
00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
appointed we'll take a look at this and
 
00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:43.680 align:start position:0%
frankly may come up with even additional
 
00:14:46.389 --> 00:14:46.399 align:start position:0%
ideas of where we would post notice but
 
00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:48.240 align:start position:0%
we wanted to give them as much guidance
 
00:14:51.269 --> 00:14:51.279 align:start position:0%
as we could so we added this document
 
00:14:53.189 --> 00:14:53.199 align:start position:0%
this document also
 
00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:54.880 align:start position:0%
helps to just sort of highlight how
 
00:14:57.189 --> 00:14:57.199 align:start position:0%
important notice is because at the end
 
00:14:58.389 --> 00:14:58.399 align:start position:0%
of the day we could have the best
 
00:14:58.399 --> 00:14:59.590 align:start position:0%
of the day we could have the best
process

00:14:59.590 --> 00:14:59.600 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:01.680 align:start position:0%
in the world and if people don't know
 
00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:03.120 align:start position:0%
about it if potential claimants don't
 
00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
know about it it's not going to be
 
00:15:05.829 --> 00:15:05.839 align:start position:0%
helpful to them
 
00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:08.480 align:start position:0%
we also recognize that
 
00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:10.720 align:start position:0%
you know after so many years
 
00:15:12.389 --> 00:15:12.399 align:start position:0%
and when we're dealing with such a large
 
00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:14.800 align:start position:0%
number of potential claimants that you
 
00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
know we can't make any assumptions about
 
00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:18.160 align:start position:0%
the circumstances
 
00:15:20.069 --> 00:15:20.079 align:start position:0%
the current circumstances of a potential
 
00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
claimant who's out there someone could
 
00:15:23.509 --> 00:15:23.519 align:start position:0%
find their cell find themselves at this
 
00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:25.120 align:start position:0%
point in any number of life
 
00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
circumstances and we want to take that
 
00:15:29.269 --> 00:15:29.279 align:start position:0%
into account when we're trying to make
 
00:15:31.269 --> 00:15:31.279 align:start position:0%
sure we cover all our bases with
 
00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:34.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:36.069 --> 00:15:36.079 align:start position:0%
so that is document
 
00:15:36.079 --> 00:15:52.949 align:start position:0%
so that is document
fis-22-308

00:15:52.949 --> 00:15:52.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:54.240 align:start position:0%
representative edward you have a
 
00:15:57.430 --> 00:15:57.440 align:start position:0%
question uh yes ma'am thank you um so uh
 
00:15:59.590 --> 00:15:59.600 align:start position:0%
mr attorney general um
 
00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:00.470 align:start position:0%
mr attorney general um
is

00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:00.480 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
what would be the process in a few years
 
00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
if um somebody who had wanted to file a
 
00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:09.120 align:start position:0%
claim or had an argument that they
 
00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:12.160 align:start position:0%
should file a claim if they if they find
 
00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:15.920 align:start position:0%
these notices inadequate is there is
 
00:16:18.629 --> 00:16:18.639 align:start position:0%
this appealable is this um
 
00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:20.560 align:start position:0%
something that they can come back and
 
00:16:22.949 --> 00:16:22.959 align:start position:0%
say that we were negligent on this is
 
00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:24.880 align:start position:0%
probably pretty comprehensive but i'm
 
00:16:26.629 --> 00:16:26.639 align:start position:0%
just curious what their
 
00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
recourse and what the outstanding risk
 
00:16:31.269 --> 00:16:31.279 align:start position:0%
would be to the state
 
00:16:31.279 --> 00:16:31.990 align:start position:0%
would be to the state
i

00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:33.920 align:start position:0%
you know the the statute that was passed
 
00:16:36.069 --> 00:16:36.079 align:start position:0%
provides a deadline of december 31st
 
00:16:36.079 --> 00:16:37.509 align:start position:0%
provides a deadline of december 31st
2024

00:16:37.509 --> 00:16:37.519 align:start position:0%
2024
 
00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:40.240 align:start position:0%
i think that if someone
 
00:16:42.389 --> 00:16:42.399 align:start position:0%
didn't get the notice
 
00:16:44.389 --> 00:16:44.399 align:start position:0%
their recourse really would be to to
 
00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:46.480 align:start position:0%
come back and make an and the deadline
 
00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:48.480 align:start position:0%
had passed i think their recourse would
 
00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:50.320 align:start position:0%
be to make an appeal to the legislature
 
00:16:52.389 --> 00:16:52.399 align:start position:0%
to extend the deadline
 
00:16:54.069 --> 00:16:54.079 align:start position:0%
or to
 
00:16:56.310 --> 00:16:56.320 align:start position:0%
to bring their claim in court i don't
 
00:16:58.949 --> 00:16:58.959 align:start position:0%
see a lot of exposure for the state on a
 
00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:00.720 align:start position:0%
claim that we didn't do a good enough
 
00:17:02.629 --> 00:17:02.639 align:start position:0%
job providing notice of what's
 
00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:04.160 align:start position:0%
essentially an alternative dispute
 
00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:05.350 align:start position:0%
essentially an alternative dispute
resolution

00:17:05.350 --> 00:17:05.360 align:start position:0%
resolution
 
00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:07.520 align:start position:0%
process but it will absolutely be our
 
00:17:08.549 --> 00:17:08.559 align:start position:0%
goal to
 
00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
to make the notice so widespread that if
 
00:17:13.590 --> 00:17:13.600 align:start position:0%
someone doesn't file a claim it won't be
 
00:17:14.870 --> 00:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
because they didn't know about it it
 
00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:16.480 align:start position:0%
would be because they decided not to
 
00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:26.480 align:start position:0%
so the next document you have in front
 
00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:27.520 align:start position:0%
of you
 
00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:29.440 align:start position:0%
again now is a separate document is
 
00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:34.549 align:start position:0%
again now is a separate document is
fis22-309

00:17:34.549 --> 00:17:34.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:36.160 align:start position:0%
this document
 
00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:37.190 align:start position:0%
this document
is

00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:37.200 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:40.880 align:start position:0%
the guidelines for valuing claims
 
00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:42.880 align:start position:0%
so in this document we made a couple of
 
00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
of significant changes
 
00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
based on our discussions with claimants
 
00:17:50.710 --> 00:17:50.720 align:start position:0%
council and i believe that
 
00:17:52.390 --> 00:17:52.400 align:start position:0%
these changes will represent a good
 
00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:54.480 align:start position:0%
compromise on how to value these claims
 
00:17:57.110 --> 00:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
and and these changes are sort of key
 
00:17:59.430 --> 00:17:59.440 align:start position:0%
or a key piece of getting a number of
 
00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:01.440 align:start position:0%
these claimants counsel on board with
 
00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
feeling that this process would work for
 
00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:08.320 align:start position:0%
so the first the first change is one
 
00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:09.520 align:start position:0%
i've already mentioned but i'll just
 
00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:12.240 align:start position:0%
note that it also appears
 
00:18:14.789 --> 00:18:14.799 align:start position:0%
in the guidelines um and it appears in a
 
00:18:16.549 --> 00:18:16.559 align:start position:0%
couple different places but this again
 
00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:19.760 align:start position:0%
is the definition of former ydc resident
 
00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:21.360 align:start position:0%
so there are a couple of places in this
 
00:18:23.669 --> 00:18:23.679 align:start position:0%
document on pages three and seven
 
00:18:25.510 --> 00:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
specifically that we again are just
 
00:18:29.029 --> 00:18:29.039 align:start position:0%
clarifying that a current resident who
 
00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:31.360 align:start position:0%
might be in ydc now or in the sununu
 
00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:33.520 align:start position:0%
what's now the sununu center now
 
00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
would be considered a former ydc
 
00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:37.440 align:start position:0%
resident for purposes of the statute and
 
00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:43.669 --> 00:18:43.679 align:start position:0%
the next change
 
00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:55.909 --> 00:18:55.919 align:start position:0%
this is near the top of page nine but
 
00:18:58.390 --> 00:18:58.400 align:start position:0%
this is in the frequency multiplier
 
00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:00.549 align:start position:0%
this is in the frequency multiplier
table

00:19:00.549 --> 00:19:00.559 align:start position:0%
table
 
00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
in the first draft of this process that
 
00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:06.160 align:start position:0%
we brought before you you'll recall that
 
00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:06.870 align:start position:0%
we brought before you you'll recall that
uh

00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:06.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
sort of the the
 
00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
range if you will of number of incidents
 
00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
spanned all the way from 1 to 25 or more
 
00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:20.160 align:start position:0%
and the multiplier went from 1 to 15.
 
00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:21.760 align:start position:0%
based on discussion that we had at the
 
00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
last committee meeting and discussions
 
00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:25.760 align:start position:0%
we had with claimants counsel
 
00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:28.720 align:start position:0%
we've we've had a lot of
 
00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:31.520 align:start position:0%
a lot of exchange about the need to
 
00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:32.789 align:start position:0%
a lot of exchange about the need to
recognize

00:19:32.789 --> 00:19:32.799 align:start position:0%
recognize
 
00:19:32.799 --> 00:19:36.310 align:start position:0%
recognize
that

00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:36.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:38.080 align:start position:0%
you know for someone who suffers sexual
 
00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:40.320 align:start position:0%
or physical abuse
 
00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:41.520 align:start position:0%
you know there may be a difference
 
00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:43.840 align:start position:0%
between one incident and two incidents
 
00:19:46.630 --> 00:19:46.640 align:start position:0%
but once you get beyond one
 
00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:48.480 align:start position:0%
uh based on the harm and the trauma that
 
00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
you suffer it really is necessary to
 
00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:55.360 align:start position:0%
to not require so many incidents in
 
00:19:57.430 --> 00:19:57.440 align:start position:0%
order to get to the top the top of the
 
00:20:00.070 --> 00:20:00.080 align:start position:0%
range as far as the value of settlements
 
00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:02.149 align:start position:0%
range as far as the value of settlements
goes

00:20:02.149 --> 00:20:02.159 align:start position:0%
goes
 
00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
given that the cap
 
00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:07.200 align:start position:0%
in this process is 1.5 million
 
00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:09.360 align:start position:0%
i think everyone recognized that that
 
00:20:12.549 --> 00:20:12.559 align:start position:0%
it's also important to
 
00:20:13.669 --> 00:20:13.679 align:start position:0%
to have
 
00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
some recognition that those who may have
 
00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
suffered more incidents of abuse
 
00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
should get more compensation to a point
 
00:20:23.590 --> 00:20:23.600 align:start position:0%
than than someone who suffered less
 
00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:26.000 align:start position:0%
incidence of abuse so those were the two
 
00:20:27.909 --> 00:20:27.919 align:start position:0%
considerations we were trying to balance
 
00:20:29.590 --> 00:20:29.600 align:start position:0%
when coming up with
 
00:20:33.669 --> 00:20:33.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:36.149 --> 00:20:36.159 align:start position:0%
when we had a were initially discussing
 
00:20:37.909 --> 00:20:37.919 align:start position:0%
this process before we even brought the
 
00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:40.000 align:start position:0%
first draft to you
 
00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:42.640 align:start position:0%
we had had a proposal from from certain
 
00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:44.720 align:start position:0%
claimants council that
 
00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:48.720 align:start position:0%
the frequency multiplier table
 
00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
go from only one to eight so with one
 
00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:53.840 align:start position:0%
incident you got a certain multiplier
 
00:20:55.350 --> 00:20:55.360 align:start position:0%
once you hit three incidents you got the
 
00:20:57.830 --> 00:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
next highest multiplier and then once
 
00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:01.029 align:start position:0%
next highest multiplier and then once
you

00:21:01.029 --> 00:21:01.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
that it only required eight to get to
 
00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:05.840 align:start position:0%
the highest multiplier
 
00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:08.240 align:start position:0%
we had put that out to
 
00:21:09.669 --> 00:21:09.679 align:start position:0%
to sort of the full universe of
 
00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:11.360 align:start position:0%
claimants council and we didn't get
 
00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:13.840 align:start position:0%
feedback one way or another on that at
 
00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:16.640 align:start position:0%
the time and so that was why we decided
 
00:21:18.789 --> 00:21:18.799 align:start position:0%
to bring our original proposal to you
 
00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:22.000 align:start position:0%
which had the wider range
 
00:21:23.909 --> 00:21:23.919 align:start position:0%
based on the committee's feedback and
 
00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:25.760 align:start position:0%
based on the discussions we've had with
 
00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
claimants council since
 
00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
i think we have arrived at a good
 
00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:31.830 align:start position:0%
i think we have arrived at a good
compromise

00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:31.840 align:start position:0%
compromise
 
00:21:35.669 --> 00:21:35.679 align:start position:0%
that that i think many claimants counsel
 
00:21:37.590 --> 00:21:37.600 align:start position:0%
generally support
 
00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
and and
 
00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:41.120 align:start position:0%
that many claimants counsel
 
00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:42.230 align:start position:0%
that many claimants counsel
see

00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:42.240 align:start position:0%
see
 
00:21:44.390 --> 00:21:44.400 align:start position:0%
and it makes them feel that this this is
 
00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
a process that will work for for many of
 
00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
their clients and that is the frequency
 
00:21:50.149 --> 00:21:50.159 align:start position:0%
multiplier you see before you now
 
00:21:52.390 --> 00:21:52.400 align:start position:0%
um it spans from
 
00:21:54.549 --> 00:21:54.559 align:start position:0%
from one incident
 
00:21:56.470 --> 00:21:56.480 align:start position:0%
it's the bottom category the top
 
00:21:58.549 --> 00:21:58.559 align:start position:0%
category is 10 or more
 
00:22:01.909 --> 00:22:01.919 align:start position:0%
and the multipliers step up 1 3 7 and
 
00:22:01.919 --> 00:22:03.110 align:start position:0%
and the multipliers step up 1 3 7 and
12.

00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
12.
 
00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:06.640 align:start position:0%
so i think what this does is balance
 
00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:09.200 align:start position:0%
it recognizes the fact that
 
00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
values of settlement should should step
 
00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
up quicker
 
00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
based on a smaller number of incidents
 
00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
but that there also should be some range
 
00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:19.190 align:start position:0%
but that there also should be some range
between

00:22:19.190 --> 00:22:19.200 align:start position:0%
between
 
00:22:21.510 --> 00:22:21.520 align:start position:0%
you know one incident in 10 or more so
 
00:22:23.029 --> 00:22:23.039 align:start position:0%
that we are
 
00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:25.280 align:start position:0%
we're giving recogni you know we're
 
00:22:27.430 --> 00:22:27.440 align:start position:0%
recognizing from a value perspective the
 
00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:29.440 align:start position:0%
fact that you know say seven or eight
 
00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:31.600 align:start position:0%
incidents are more harmful than than one
 
00:22:34.789 --> 00:22:34.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:36.390 --> 00:22:36.400 align:start position:0%
as i've said repeatedly throughout this
 
00:22:39.669 --> 00:22:39.679 align:start position:0%
process there really is no perfect way
 
00:22:41.669 --> 00:22:41.679 align:start position:0%
to do something like this you know
 
00:22:43.029 --> 00:22:43.039 align:start position:0%
there's no
 
00:22:44.070 --> 00:22:44.080 align:start position:0%
there's no
 
00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:46.240 align:start position:0%
amount of money that really compensates
 
00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:48.640 align:start position:0%
someone for for experiencing sexual or
 
00:22:49.990 --> 00:22:50.000 align:start position:0%
physical abuse
 
00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:52.400 align:start position:0%
and there's never going to be a perfect
 
00:22:54.470 --> 00:22:54.480 align:start position:0%
way at which you can arrive at
 
00:22:56.230 --> 00:22:56.240 align:start position:0%
at a value
 
00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:57.110 align:start position:0%
at a value
um

00:22:57.110 --> 00:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
or a way to to value
 
00:23:01.909 --> 00:23:01.919 align:start position:0%
compensation that someone should receive
 
00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:04.400 align:start position:0%
for for that type of harm
 
00:23:07.350 --> 00:23:07.360 align:start position:0%
what we tried to do with this is
 
00:23:09.029 --> 00:23:09.039 align:start position:0%
put a lot of thought into it have a lot
 
00:23:10.710 --> 00:23:10.720 align:start position:0%
of conversations
 
00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:12.320 align:start position:0%
think about all the considerations at
 
00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:14.880 align:start position:0%
play and arrive at
 
00:23:17.190 --> 00:23:17.200 align:start position:0%
at a compromise that does the best we
 
00:23:18.710 --> 00:23:18.720 align:start position:0%
can to balance the different
 
00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:20.480 align:start position:0%
considerations that are there and i i
 
00:23:23.270 --> 00:23:23.280 align:start position:0%
think this table does it and i think
 
00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:25.520 align:start position:0%
that is reflected in the letters that
 
00:23:27.110 --> 00:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
you will have received from claimant's
 
00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:28.070 align:start position:0%
you will have received from claimant's
counsel

00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
counsel
 
00:23:29.669 --> 00:23:29.679 align:start position:0%
and it's reflected in conversations
 
00:23:31.350 --> 00:23:31.360 align:start position:0%
we've had with other claimants counsel
 
00:23:33.430 --> 00:23:33.440 align:start position:0%
who while they they were not comfortable
 
00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:35.120 align:start position:0%
sending a public letter
 
00:23:37.270 --> 00:23:37.280 align:start position:0%
um they they indicated that their their
 
00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:39.440 align:start position:0%
clients or many of their clients they
 
00:23:41.110 --> 00:23:41.120 align:start position:0%
thought would participate in this
 
00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:43.669 align:start position:0%
thought would participate in this
process

00:23:43.669 --> 00:23:43.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:45.430 --> 00:23:45.440 align:start position:0%
so that is that's probably the most
 
00:23:48.149 --> 00:23:48.159 align:start position:0%
major change made in in the
 
00:23:50.070 --> 00:23:50.080 align:start position:0%
in the guide the valuation guidelines
 
00:23:51.750 --> 00:23:51.760 align:start position:0%
the other thing you'll notice is that we
 
00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:54.240 align:start position:0%
no longer have two separate tables for
 
00:23:57.029 --> 00:23:57.039 align:start position:0%
sexual abuse and physical abuse this
 
00:23:59.830 --> 00:23:59.840 align:start position:0%
revised frequency multiplier table
 
00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:02.640 align:start position:0%
applies to both sexual abuse and
 
00:24:08.950 --> 00:24:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:12.480 align:start position:0%
a couple of other changes we've
 
00:24:14.149 --> 00:24:14.159 align:start position:0%
we've made
 
00:24:16.870 --> 00:24:16.880 align:start position:0%
when it comes to valuing settlements
 
00:24:19.350 --> 00:24:19.360 align:start position:0%
were we're based again on discussions
 
00:24:22.149 --> 00:24:22.159 align:start position:0%
with claimants council
 
00:24:24.470 --> 00:24:24.480 align:start position:0%
the first one i'll point out
 
00:24:26.149 --> 00:24:26.159 align:start position:0%
well they're both on page nine but the
 
00:24:27.990 --> 00:24:28.000 align:start position:0%
first one i'll point out is down in
 
00:24:31.110 --> 00:24:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:32.960 align:start position:0%
these are the aggregate aggravating
 
00:24:37.430 --> 00:24:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:38.789 --> 00:24:38.799 align:start position:0%
and this
 
00:24:40.549 --> 00:24:40.559 align:start position:0%
this first change
 
00:24:42.149 --> 00:24:42.159 align:start position:0%
is on the value
 
00:24:44.549 --> 00:24:44.559 align:start position:0%
of the aggravating factor associated
 
00:24:46.390 --> 00:24:46.400 align:start position:0%
with photographs or video recordings
 
00:24:47.669 --> 00:24:47.679 align:start position:0%
that might have been taken during an
 
00:24:50.710 --> 00:24:50.720 align:start position:0%
incident of abuse
 
00:24:51.909 --> 00:24:51.919 align:start position:0%
as we've talked about this with
 
00:24:53.669 --> 00:24:53.679 align:start position:0%
claimants counsel we we have talked
 
00:24:55.750 --> 00:24:55.760 align:start position:0%
about the fact that for someone who
 
00:24:57.269 --> 00:24:57.279 align:start position:0%
suffers abuse
 
00:24:59.590 --> 00:24:59.600 align:start position:0%
the fact that that photos or video might
 
00:25:03.029 --> 00:25:03.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:04.720 align:start position:0%
is something that can sort of cause
 
00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:06.640 align:start position:0%
continuous trauma because if you have
 
00:25:08.390 --> 00:25:08.400 align:start position:0%
suffered abuse even if it's years and
 
00:25:10.470 --> 00:25:10.480 align:start position:0%
years ago if you have reason to think
 
00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
that there are of their photos or videos
 
00:25:15.510 --> 00:25:15.520 align:start position:0%
that exist of that abuse you live in
 
00:25:17.430 --> 00:25:17.440 align:start position:0%
constant fear that those photos or
 
00:25:20.310 --> 00:25:20.320 align:start position:0%
videos could could resurface and
 
00:25:21.430 --> 00:25:21.440 align:start position:0%
and that
 
00:25:23.590 --> 00:25:23.600 align:start position:0%
that sort of causes a continuous trauma
 
00:25:25.350 --> 00:25:25.360 align:start position:0%
continuous harm from the abuse you've
 
00:25:28.149 --> 00:25:28.159 align:start position:0%
suffered even if it's decades ago so
 
00:25:30.470 --> 00:25:30.480 align:start position:0%
we've increased this aggravating factor
 
00:25:32.789 --> 00:25:32.799 align:start position:0%
from fifty thousand dollars to a hundred
 
00:25:37.110 --> 00:25:37.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:39.750 --> 00:25:39.760 align:start position:0%
the other change we made
 
00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
here is in the
 
00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:43.760 align:start position:0%
the aggravating factor that is
 
00:25:46.310 --> 00:25:46.320 align:start position:0%
associated with the duration of abuse so
 
00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
the amount the length of time during
 
00:25:50.390 --> 00:25:50.400 align:start position:0%
which someone might have suffered abuse
 
00:25:54.470 --> 00:25:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:57.750 --> 00:25:57.760 align:start position:0%
it's near the top of the page
 
00:25:59.590 --> 00:25:59.600 align:start position:0%
but what we've done in the original
 
00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:01.750 align:start position:0%
but what we've done in the original
proposal

00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:01.760 align:start position:0%
proposal
 
00:26:03.190 --> 00:26:03.200 align:start position:0%
uh the course of conduct would have had
 
00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
to continue for 24 months for this
 
00:26:07.590 --> 00:26:07.600 align:start position:0%
aggravating factor to come into play
 
00:26:09.750 --> 00:26:09.760 align:start position:0%
we've reduced that period from 24 months
 
00:26:11.190 --> 00:26:11.200 align:start position:0%
to 12 months
 
00:26:12.710 --> 00:26:12.720 align:start position:0%
based on discussions with claimants
 
00:26:14.470 --> 00:26:14.480 align:start position:0%
counsel and we've increased the
 
00:26:21.350 --> 00:26:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:23.029 --> 00:26:23.039 align:start position:0%
so again this is
 
00:26:24.710 --> 00:26:24.720 align:start position:0%
i think this is another change that came
 
00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
out of what were were very um
 
00:26:29.029 --> 00:26:29.039 align:start position:0%
thoughtful and and productive
 
00:26:30.630 --> 00:26:30.640 align:start position:0%
conversations with claimants council
 
00:26:32.070 --> 00:26:32.080 align:start position:0%
about different things we needed to
 
00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:34.310 align:start position:0%
about different things we needed to
recognize

00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:34.320 align:start position:0%
recognize
 
00:26:36.630 --> 00:26:36.640 align:start position:0%
when it comes to valuation
 
00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:43.029 --> 00:26:43.039 align:start position:0%
the last
 
00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:53.269 --> 00:26:53.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:58.230 --> 00:26:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:59.990 --> 00:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
but this was the section
 
00:27:02.470 --> 00:27:02.480 align:start position:0%
related to issues of credibility
 
00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:04.720 align:start position:0%
in in the last version of of this
 
00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:07.360 align:start position:0%
document we had a sentence that said
 
00:27:09.430 --> 00:27:09.440 align:start position:0%
that you know statements made by a
 
00:27:11.590 --> 00:27:11.600 align:start position:0%
claimant made under oath and notarized
 
00:27:12.870 --> 00:27:12.880 align:start position:0%
would be would
 
00:27:15.269 --> 00:27:15.279 align:start position:0%
we would presume them to be credible
 
00:27:17.669 --> 00:27:17.679 align:start position:0%
unless shown otherwise
 
00:27:19.350 --> 00:27:19.360 align:start position:0%
um with that statement we were just
 
00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
trying we were trying to reflect
 
00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:23.029 align:start position:0%
trying we were trying to reflect
that

00:27:23.029 --> 00:27:23.039 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:27:24.389 --> 00:27:24.399 align:start position:0%
you know we would not assume any
 
00:27:25.830 --> 00:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
claimant who comes to this process is
 
00:27:27.750 --> 00:27:27.760 align:start position:0%
not telling the truth we would treat
 
00:27:29.830 --> 00:27:29.840 align:start position:0%
every claimant with respect and dignity
 
00:27:31.510 --> 00:27:31.520 align:start position:0%
but based on discussions with the
 
00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:33.269 align:start position:0%
but based on discussions with the
committee

00:27:33.269 --> 00:27:33.279 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:27:34.789 --> 00:27:34.799 align:start position:0%
and looking back at the legislative
 
00:27:34.799 --> 00:27:36.470 align:start position:0%
and looking back at the legislative
history

00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:36.480 align:start position:0%
history
 
00:27:38.389 --> 00:27:38.399 align:start position:0%
i mean we ultimately determined that we
 
00:27:40.789 --> 00:27:40.799 align:start position:0%
we did not need to have that sentence in
 
00:27:42.389 --> 00:27:42.399 align:start position:0%
there and really should not have it in
 
00:27:44.470 --> 00:27:44.480 align:start position:0%
there because
 
00:27:46.630 --> 00:27:46.640 align:start position:0%
um it would lead to a concern that we
 
00:27:48.389 --> 00:27:48.399 align:start position:0%
were say shifting the burden of proof
 
00:27:50.789 --> 00:27:50.799 align:start position:0%
from the claimant to
 
00:27:52.630 --> 00:27:52.640 align:start position:0%
to the state
 
00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:54.310 align:start position:0%
to the state
and

00:27:54.310 --> 00:27:54.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:27:55.669 --> 00:27:55.679 align:start position:0%
you know also in looking back at the
 
00:27:57.669 --> 00:27:57.679 align:start position:0%
legislative history there were specific
 
00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:00.240 align:start position:0%
discussions about that issue and the
 
00:28:01.909 --> 00:28:01.919 align:start position:0%
language regarding treating every
 
00:28:03.830 --> 00:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
claimant with respect and dignity was
 
00:28:06.630 --> 00:28:06.640 align:start position:0%
was put in there i think specifically as
 
00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
a as a way to reflect that value without
 
00:28:11.269 --> 00:28:11.279 align:start position:0%
having language that sounded like it
 
00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:13.200 align:start position:0%
would be burden-shifting and so we
 
00:28:14.950 --> 00:28:14.960 align:start position:0%
ultimately determined based on feedback
 
00:28:16.710 --> 00:28:16.720 align:start position:0%
from the from the committee and looking
 
00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
back at the legislative history that
 
00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:20.080 align:start position:0%
that sentence really should come out so
 
00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:21.760 align:start position:0%
we've pulled that sentence out of this
 
00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:23.029 align:start position:0%
we've pulled that sentence out of this
section

00:28:23.029 --> 00:28:23.039 align:start position:0%
section
 
00:28:25.190 --> 00:28:25.200 align:start position:0%
i think
 
00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
you know these documents still
 
00:28:28.630 --> 00:28:28.640 align:start position:0%
absolutely reflect the value that we
 
00:28:30.870 --> 00:28:30.880 align:start position:0%
will treat every claimant that comes to
 
00:28:32.630 --> 00:28:32.640 align:start position:0%
this process with respect
 
00:28:34.549 --> 00:28:34.559 align:start position:0%
with dignity will listen to their
 
00:28:36.950 --> 00:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
stories take in their information
 
00:28:38.870 --> 00:28:38.880 align:start position:0%
certainly not assume anyone is not
 
00:28:41.510 --> 00:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
telling the truth but at the same time
 
00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:43.440 align:start position:0%
it's important not to
 
00:28:44.789 --> 00:28:44.799 align:start position:0%
not to have language in there that looks
 
00:28:47.350 --> 00:28:47.360 align:start position:0%
like it's a burden uh a language it
 
00:28:51.190 --> 00:28:51.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:54.710 --> 00:28:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:57.190 --> 00:28:57.200 align:start position:0%
kind of the the final major change that
 
00:28:58.950 --> 00:28:58.960 align:start position:0%
we we made to
 
00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:15.269 --> 00:29:15.279 align:start position:0%
the last document that you have in front
 
00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
of you
 
00:29:24.230 --> 00:29:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:27.190 --> 00:29:27.200 align:start position:0%
and this is the
 
00:29:29.430 --> 00:29:29.440 align:start position:0%
the claim packet which includes the
 
00:29:30.870 --> 00:29:30.880 align:start position:0%
claim form
 
00:29:33.110 --> 00:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
and the worksheet
 
00:29:34.950 --> 00:29:34.960 align:start position:0%
um we've tried to make a number of
 
00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:37.440 align:start position:0%
changes here to
 
00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
to make this
 
00:29:42.549 --> 00:29:42.559 align:start position:0%
more accessible to victims of slash
 
00:29:42.559 --> 00:29:44.149 align:start position:0%
more accessible to victims of slash
claimants

00:29:44.149 --> 00:29:44.159 align:start position:0%
claimants
 
00:29:46.470 --> 00:29:46.480 align:start position:0%
and to
 
00:29:49.110 --> 00:29:49.120 align:start position:0%
to make it more user friendly
 
00:29:53.029 --> 00:29:53.039 align:start position:0%
and to make it even clearer that
 
00:29:56.070 --> 00:29:56.080 align:start position:0%
you know we recognize that any victim
 
00:29:58.230 --> 00:29:58.240 align:start position:0%
or claimant will come to this process in
 
00:29:59.669 --> 00:29:59.679 align:start position:0%
a different situation in different
 
00:29:59.679 --> 00:30:01.190 align:start position:0%
a different situation in different
circumstances

00:30:01.190 --> 00:30:01.200 align:start position:0%
circumstances
 
00:30:03.190 --> 00:30:03.200 align:start position:0%
with perhaps different capacity to
 
00:30:05.269 --> 00:30:05.279 align:start position:0%
really grapple with
 
00:30:07.669 --> 00:30:07.679 align:start position:0%
a document that no matter how we try to
 
00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:09.440 align:start position:0%
simplify it is going to be
 
00:30:11.590 --> 00:30:11.600 align:start position:0%
somewhat complicated just because we are
 
00:30:13.190 --> 00:30:13.200 align:start position:0%
dealing with
 
00:30:15.990 --> 00:30:16.000 align:start position:0%
with frankly complicated issues but we
 
00:30:17.669 --> 00:30:17.679 align:start position:0%
have tried to
 
00:30:20.389 --> 00:30:20.399 align:start position:0%
to make it as simple as we can
 
00:30:22.789 --> 00:30:22.799 align:start position:0%
the first thing we've done based on
 
00:30:25.350 --> 00:30:25.360 align:start position:0%
feedback at the last committee meeting
 
00:30:27.510 --> 00:30:27.520 align:start position:0%
was just to improve the line spacing so
 
00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:28.710 align:start position:0%
was just to improve the line spacing so
where

00:30:28.710 --> 00:30:28.720 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:30:30.630 --> 00:30:30.640 align:start position:0%
you'll just notice where that there's
 
00:30:32.789 --> 00:30:32.799 align:start position:0%
there's a section for writing in
 
00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:34.960 align:start position:0%
content we've tried to improve that line
 
00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:36.389 align:start position:0%
content we've tried to improve that line
spacing

00:30:36.389 --> 00:30:36.399 align:start position:0%
spacing
 
00:30:38.789 --> 00:30:38.799 align:start position:0%
i do think that
 
00:30:40.470 --> 00:30:40.480 align:start position:0%
you know it's important to remember that
 
00:30:42.630 --> 00:30:42.640 align:start position:0%
in many cases someone might just attach
 
00:30:44.470 --> 00:30:44.480 align:start position:0%
additional sheets so they may not rely
 
00:30:47.190 --> 00:30:47.200 align:start position:0%
on what's here to to write in what they
 
00:30:48.710 --> 00:30:48.720 align:start position:0%
want to write in they may have a
 
00:30:50.789 --> 00:30:50.799 align:start position:0%
separate piece of paper where they write
 
00:30:52.870 --> 00:30:52.880 align:start position:0%
they write additional information but
 
00:30:54.310 --> 00:30:54.320 align:start position:0%
we've at least
 
00:30:57.110 --> 00:30:57.120 align:start position:0%
tried to widen that spacing out so it
 
00:30:58.950 --> 00:30:58.960 align:start position:0%
looks a little more
 
00:31:01.350 --> 00:31:01.360 align:start position:0%
it just is easier to get get the writing
 
00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:03.509 align:start position:0%
it just is easier to get get the writing
in

00:31:03.509 --> 00:31:03.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:05.350 --> 00:31:05.360 align:start position:0%
we have also throughout this document
 
00:31:07.669 --> 00:31:07.679 align:start position:0%
based on feedback from the committee
 
00:31:09.509 --> 00:31:09.519 align:start position:0%
and again we've had discussions about
 
00:31:11.669 --> 00:31:11.679 align:start position:0%
the the deadline for submitting claims
 
00:31:14.789 --> 00:31:14.799 align:start position:0%
we've just tried to add and highlight um
 
00:31:16.950 --> 00:31:16.960 align:start position:0%
the notice about what the deadline is to
 
00:31:19.509 --> 00:31:19.519 align:start position:0%
submit your claim in various places so
 
00:31:20.950 --> 00:31:20.960 align:start position:0%
you'll see that throughout this document
 
00:31:21.909 --> 00:31:21.919 align:start position:0%
i won't
 
00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:23.600 align:start position:0%
you know turn to every place where that
 
00:31:25.190 --> 00:31:25.200 align:start position:0%
appears but we've
 
00:31:27.029 --> 00:31:27.039 align:start position:0%
tried to put a black box around it tried
 
00:31:28.789 --> 00:31:28.799 align:start position:0%
to put it in more places so that it is
 
00:31:29.990 --> 00:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
very clear
 
00:31:31.909 --> 00:31:31.919 align:start position:0%
what what the deadline is it's december
 
00:31:38.950 --> 00:31:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:40.470 --> 00:31:40.480 align:start position:0%
at the last committee meeting and in
 
00:31:42.470 --> 00:31:42.480 align:start position:0%
discussions with with claimants council
 
00:31:44.710 --> 00:31:44.720 align:start position:0%
and our victim witness advocates victim
 
00:31:46.789 --> 00:31:46.799 align:start position:0%
witness specialists
 
00:31:50.149 --> 00:31:50.159 align:start position:0%
we had a lot of discussion about the
 
00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
you know this issue of what what is
 
00:31:55.509 --> 00:31:55.519 align:start position:0%
required versus what is optional
 
00:31:58.310 --> 00:31:58.320 align:start position:0%
and ultimately
 
00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:00.720 align:start position:0%
the way we've tried to address that here
 
00:32:02.870 --> 00:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
is to set this up so that that no
 
00:32:05.990 --> 00:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
information is required that we make it
 
00:32:07.830 --> 00:32:07.840 align:start position:0%
clear to claimants that the more
 
00:32:10.389 --> 00:32:10.399 align:start position:0%
information they submit the better um
 
00:32:10.399 --> 00:32:11.830 align:start position:0%
information they submit the better um
that

00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:11.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:13.600 align:start position:0%
that certain information may eventually
 
00:32:15.509 --> 00:32:15.519 align:start position:0%
be required obviously we will need to
 
00:32:17.269 --> 00:32:17.279 align:start position:0%
know someone's name we'll need to have
 
00:32:19.190 --> 00:32:19.200 align:start position:0%
sufficient identifying information but
 
00:32:22.149 --> 00:32:22.159 align:start position:0%
that that a claimant should just put in
 
00:32:24.389 --> 00:32:24.399 align:start position:0%
to this form as much information as they
 
00:32:24.399 --> 00:32:25.269 align:start position:0%
to this form as much information as they
can

00:32:25.269 --> 00:32:25.279 align:start position:0%
can
 
00:32:26.549 --> 00:32:26.559 align:start position:0%
and that
 
00:32:28.630 --> 00:32:28.640 align:start position:0%
not only is assistance available but
 
00:32:31.190 --> 00:32:31.200 align:start position:0%
also once a form is submitted if the
 
00:32:33.269 --> 00:32:33.279 align:start position:0%
administrator determines that additional
 
00:32:35.029 --> 00:32:35.039 align:start position:0%
information is needed the administrator
 
00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:37.840 align:start position:0%
will contact the claimant and work to to
 
00:32:41.269 --> 00:32:41.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:43.669 --> 00:32:43.679 align:start position:0%
what we've really done here is
 
00:32:45.909 --> 00:32:45.919 align:start position:0%
is put this in the hands of the
 
00:32:47.509 --> 00:32:47.519 align:start position:0%
administrator who will be the third
 
00:32:49.269 --> 00:32:49.279 align:start position:0%
party neutral it will ultimately be up
 
00:32:51.269 --> 00:32:51.279 align:start position:0%
to the administrator to take a look at
 
00:32:53.750 --> 00:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
what's submitted and make determinations
 
00:32:55.430 --> 00:32:55.440 align:start position:0%
as to what additional information is
 
00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:56.389 align:start position:0%
as to what additional information is
needed

00:32:56.389 --> 00:32:56.399 align:start position:0%
needed
 
00:33:00.950 --> 00:33:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:03.200 align:start position:0%
i think that is a good way to balance
 
00:33:05.830 --> 00:33:05.840 align:start position:0%
the need to collect information with the
 
00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:09.760 align:start position:0%
need to make this accessible to victims
 
00:33:12.789 --> 00:33:12.799 align:start position:0%
ultimately in my mind it is
 
00:33:14.950 --> 00:33:14.960 align:start position:0%
it is actually helpful to a claimant or
 
00:33:16.149 --> 00:33:16.159 align:start position:0%
a victim
 
00:33:18.789 --> 00:33:18.799 align:start position:0%
to ask for certain information even if
 
00:33:20.549 --> 00:33:20.559 align:start position:0%
we're not going to require it because
 
00:33:22.630 --> 00:33:22.640 align:start position:0%
what we're doing when we do that is that
 
00:33:24.389 --> 00:33:24.399 align:start position:0%
we're providing we're providing sort of
 
00:33:27.430 --> 00:33:27.440 align:start position:0%
the guide posts and and the direction as
 
00:33:29.590 --> 00:33:29.600 align:start position:0%
as to what information
 
00:33:32.630 --> 00:33:32.640 align:start position:0%
will make their claims stronger will
 
00:33:34.389 --> 00:33:34.399 align:start position:0%
strengthen their ability to get a higher
 
00:33:36.710 --> 00:33:36.720 align:start position:0%
award i think that asking for that
 
00:33:38.470 --> 00:33:38.480 align:start position:0%
information is
 
00:33:40.870 --> 00:33:40.880 align:start position:0%
is i would submit is helpful to
 
00:33:43.029 --> 00:33:43.039 align:start position:0%
claimants and actually makes this victim
 
00:33:43.039 --> 00:33:44.549 align:start position:0%
claimants and actually makes this victim
friendly

00:33:44.549 --> 00:33:44.559 align:start position:0%
friendly
 
00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
but we do recognize that that we need to
 
00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:49.590 align:start position:0%
but we do recognize that that we need to
provide

00:33:49.590 --> 00:33:49.600 align:start position:0%
provide
 
00:33:51.269 --> 00:33:51.279 align:start position:0%
a fair amount of flexibility in what we
 
00:33:53.430 --> 00:33:53.440 align:start position:0%
would require to be submitted and so
 
00:33:54.630 --> 00:33:54.640 align:start position:0%
while we
 
00:33:56.070 --> 00:33:56.080 align:start position:0%
i think what we've achieved here by
 
00:33:56.080 --> 00:33:57.430 align:start position:0%
i think what we've achieved here by
making

00:33:57.430 --> 00:33:57.440 align:start position:0%
making
 
00:33:59.509 --> 00:33:59.519 align:start position:0%
this information generally optional is
 
00:34:00.950 --> 00:34:00.960 align:start position:0%
we have given
 
00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:02.070 align:start position:0%
we have given
um

00:34:02.070 --> 00:34:02.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:04.710 --> 00:34:04.720 align:start position:0%
some guideposts and a roadmap
 
00:34:07.750 --> 00:34:07.760 align:start position:0%
for a claimant on what is helpful
 
00:34:09.589 --> 00:34:09.599 align:start position:0%
and what will help them strengthen their
 
00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:12.240 align:start position:0%
claim without requiring them to submit
 
00:34:14.550 --> 00:34:14.560 align:start position:0%
it to have their claim processed and so
 
00:34:15.990 --> 00:34:16.000 align:start position:0%
it really
 
00:34:18.550 --> 00:34:18.560 align:start position:0%
it gives the claimant options as to how
 
00:34:21.030 --> 00:34:21.040 align:start position:0%
much they want to bring forward and it
 
00:34:23.030 --> 00:34:23.040 align:start position:0%
puts the discretion in the hands of the
 
00:34:25.349 --> 00:34:25.359 align:start position:0%
administrator who will be the neutral
 
00:34:28.310 --> 00:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
party in this process to determine
 
00:34:30.069 --> 00:34:30.079 align:start position:0%
you know what might be missing and what
 
00:34:33.430 --> 00:34:33.440 align:start position:0%
they need to go back and ask for
 
00:34:35.750 --> 00:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
so that that's reflected in a couple
 
00:34:37.669 --> 00:34:37.679 align:start position:0%
different places in this document you
 
00:34:39.750 --> 00:34:39.760 align:start position:0%
first see it on page two
 
00:34:41.430 --> 00:34:41.440 align:start position:0%
where we
 
00:34:43.349 --> 00:34:43.359 align:start position:0%
take out any reference to required
 
00:34:45.829 --> 00:34:45.839 align:start position:0%
information and just ask that a claimant
 
00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
do their best to provide as much
 
00:34:51.669 --> 00:34:51.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:56.149 --> 00:34:56.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:56.159 --> 00:34:57.109 align:start position:0%
 
where

00:34:57.109 --> 00:34:57.119 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:34:58.550 --> 00:34:58.560 align:start position:0%
even for some of the required
 
00:35:01.030 --> 00:35:01.040 align:start position:0%
identifying information
 
00:35:02.710 --> 00:35:02.720 align:start position:0%
we note that that might eventually be
 
00:35:04.150 --> 00:35:04.160 align:start position:0%
required but it's not going to be
 
00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:05.680 align:start position:0%
required in order for
 
00:35:07.750 --> 00:35:07.760 align:start position:0%
their a claim to be taken in and for the
 
00:35:09.109 --> 00:35:09.119 align:start position:0%
review to begin and for the
 
00:35:11.990 --> 00:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
administrator um to take a look at it
 
00:35:13.990 --> 00:35:14.000 align:start position:0%
and begin the process
 
00:35:15.829 --> 00:35:15.839 align:start position:0%
of reaching back out to the claimant if
 
00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:18.240 align:start position:0%
necessary to collect identifying
 
00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:19.430 align:start position:0%
necessary to collect identifying
information

00:35:19.430 --> 00:35:19.440 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:35:21.270 --> 00:35:21.280 align:start position:0%
again there there's there's some basic
 
00:35:23.190 --> 00:35:23.200 align:start position:0%
things that we will need
 
00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:24.470 align:start position:0%
things that we will need
eventually

00:35:24.470 --> 00:35:24.480 align:start position:0%
eventually
 
00:35:26.390 --> 00:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
for a claimant if they submit a claim
 
00:35:28.150 --> 00:35:28.160 align:start position:0%
and and money's going to be paid out on
 
00:35:30.069 --> 00:35:30.079 align:start position:0%
that claim we'll need to make sure that
 
00:35:32.069 --> 00:35:32.079 align:start position:0%
we know who that person is we'll need to
 
00:35:34.310 --> 00:35:34.320 align:start position:0%
make sure that we can confirm it but we
 
00:35:36.069 --> 00:35:36.079 align:start position:0%
want to make this as user friendly as
 
00:35:38.069 --> 00:35:38.079 align:start position:0%
possible and we want to make it clear
 
00:35:38.079 --> 00:35:38.950 align:start position:0%
possible and we want to make it clear
that

00:35:38.950 --> 00:35:38.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
this process will be set up in such a
 
00:35:42.950 --> 00:35:42.960 align:start position:0%
way that everything possible will be
 
00:35:45.910 --> 00:35:45.920 align:start position:0%
done to assist someone in providing the
 
00:35:48.950 --> 00:35:48.960 align:start position:0%
necessary information so giving them
 
00:35:50.710 --> 00:35:50.720 align:start position:0%
guidance on what information is helpful
 
00:35:52.790 --> 00:35:52.800 align:start position:0%
and also giving them assistance on on
 
00:35:54.069 --> 00:35:54.079 align:start position:0%
collecting it
 
00:35:56.150 --> 00:35:56.160 align:start position:0%
we certainly don't want the collection
 
00:35:57.910 --> 00:35:57.920 align:start position:0%
the need to collect information to be
 
00:36:06.150 --> 00:36:06.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:07.670 --> 00:36:07.680 align:start position:0%
so those are really
 
00:36:08.950 --> 00:36:08.960 align:start position:0%
these changes just kind of appear
 
00:36:10.310 --> 00:36:10.320 align:start position:0%
throughout the packet but those are
 
00:36:13.990 --> 00:36:14.000 align:start position:0%
really the the major the major change
 
00:36:15.829 --> 00:36:15.839 align:start position:0%
made to the claim packet
 
00:36:17.829 --> 00:36:17.839 align:start position:0%
is setting it up so that it's the
 
00:36:20.069 --> 00:36:20.079 align:start position:0%
information is optional
 
00:36:22.150 --> 00:36:22.160 align:start position:0%
in the worksheet which again is is an
 
00:36:24.470 --> 00:36:24.480 align:start position:0%
optional tool for a claimant i'll just
 
00:36:26.950 --> 00:36:26.960 align:start position:0%
note that we have um
 
00:36:31.109 --> 00:36:31.119 align:start position:0%
again made the changes necessary to
 
00:36:32.470 --> 00:36:32.480 align:start position:0%
to align with the fact that the
 
00:36:33.829 --> 00:36:33.839 align:start position:0%
multiplier is now going to look
 
00:36:33.839 --> 00:36:35.109 align:start position:0%
multiplier is now going to look
different

00:36:35.109 --> 00:36:35.119 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:36:37.349 --> 00:36:37.359 align:start position:0%
and made the changes necessary to align
 
00:36:38.829 --> 00:36:38.839 align:start position:0%
with the fact that
 
00:36:41.510 --> 00:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
um the aggravating factor for
 
00:36:44.950 --> 00:36:44.960 align:start position:0%
photographs or video is is now up to 125
 
00:36:46.310 --> 00:36:46.320 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:47.670 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
and

00:36:47.670 --> 00:36:47.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:36:49.270 --> 00:36:49.280 align:start position:0%
the duration
 
00:36:51.430 --> 00:36:51.440 align:start position:0%
the change to sort of uh the aggravating
 
00:36:53.270 --> 00:36:53.280 align:start position:0%
factor for the conduct occurring over
 
00:36:56.390 --> 00:36:56.400 align:start position:0%
the over a period of time has been we've
 
00:36:58.230 --> 00:36:58.240 align:start position:0%
reduced that time period from 24 months
 
00:36:59.430 --> 00:36:59.440 align:start position:0%
to 12 months and increased the
 
00:37:02.150 --> 00:37:02.160 align:start position:0%
multiplier from 0.25 to 0.5
 
00:37:04.710 --> 00:37:04.720 align:start position:0%
you'll see those two changes on pages 8
 
00:37:06.550 --> 00:37:06.560 align:start position:0%
and 9
 
00:37:14.470 --> 00:37:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:16.230 --> 00:37:16.240 align:start position:0%
so again they're just identical changes
 
00:37:17.990 --> 00:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
that were they're identical to the chain
 
00:37:19.270 --> 00:37:19.280 align:start position:0%
the same changes we made in the
 
00:37:25.750 --> 00:37:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:27.430 --> 00:37:27.440 align:start position:0%
in addition to the
 
00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
or i should just say just to kind of sum
 
00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:29.990 align:start position:0%
or i should just say just to kind of sum
up

00:37:29.990 --> 00:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:37:34.470 --> 00:37:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:36.150 --> 00:37:36.160 align:start position:0%
i would say you know there aren't a
 
00:37:38.550 --> 00:37:38.560 align:start position:0%
large number of changes to what we
 
00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:40.240 align:start position:0%
presented last time but i think the
 
00:37:42.069 --> 00:37:42.079 align:start position:0%
changes that were made were some very
 
00:37:43.510 --> 00:37:43.520 align:start position:0%
key changes
 
00:37:46.310 --> 00:37:46.320 align:start position:0%
the multiplier table was was a very i
 
00:37:48.150 --> 00:37:48.160 align:start position:0%
think fundamental change made to the
 
00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:49.510 align:start position:0%
think fundamental change made to the
valuation

00:37:49.510 --> 00:37:49.520 align:start position:0%
valuation
 
00:37:51.990 --> 00:37:52.000 align:start position:0%
guidelines that
 
00:37:54.710 --> 00:37:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:56.870 align:start position:0%
 
addressed

00:37:56.870 --> 00:37:56.880 align:start position:0%
addressed
 
00:37:59.430 --> 00:37:59.440 align:start position:0%
perhaps the most significant concern we
 
00:38:01.589 --> 00:38:01.599 align:start position:0%
heard from many claimants council out
 
00:38:03.109 --> 00:38:03.119 align:start position:0%
there regarding
 
00:38:05.109 --> 00:38:05.119 align:start position:0%
requiring less incidents to get to the
 
00:38:06.950 --> 00:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
top value
 
00:38:08.470 --> 00:38:08.480 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:38:10.790 --> 00:38:10.800 align:start position:0%
shifting the the packet and the
 
00:38:13.670 --> 00:38:13.680 align:start position:0%
worksheet from required information to
 
00:38:16.390 --> 00:38:16.400 align:start position:0%
information that's all optional
 
00:38:19.270 --> 00:38:19.280 align:start position:0%
i i think
 
00:38:21.589 --> 00:38:21.599 align:start position:0%
really goes a long way to addressing the
 
00:38:22.950 --> 00:38:22.960 align:start position:0%
concern that the
 
00:38:24.950 --> 00:38:24.960 align:start position:0%
claim form and the worksheet is too
 
00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:27.589 align:start position:0%
claim form and the worksheet is too
complicated

00:38:27.589 --> 00:38:27.599 align:start position:0%
complicated
 
00:38:29.750 --> 00:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
again there there was no
 
00:38:31.589 --> 00:38:31.599 align:start position:0%
i think there was no way to really put
 
00:38:34.230 --> 00:38:34.240 align:start position:0%
together the the claim packet
 
00:38:35.910 --> 00:38:35.920 align:start position:0%
and the form
 
00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:37.190 align:start position:0%
and the form
without

00:38:37.190 --> 00:38:37.200 align:start position:0%
without
 
00:38:39.430 --> 00:38:39.440 align:start position:0%
having a number of questions and
 
00:38:41.270 --> 00:38:41.280 align:start position:0%
requests for information and then the
 
00:38:43.750 --> 00:38:43.760 align:start position:0%
reason again for that is that by asking
 
00:38:46.310 --> 00:38:46.320 align:start position:0%
those questions and showing claimants
 
00:38:48.550 --> 00:38:48.560 align:start position:0%
what information will be helpful to them
 
00:38:51.349 --> 00:38:51.359 align:start position:0%
we're actually giving them a road map to
 
00:38:53.349 --> 00:38:53.359 align:start position:0%
to what can lead them to potentially
 
00:38:55.109 --> 00:38:55.119 align:start position:0%
higher settlement value
 
00:38:58.310 --> 00:38:58.320 align:start position:0%
but by making that optional we're not
 
00:39:00.150 --> 00:39:00.160 align:start position:0%
requiring that all of that information
 
00:39:01.910 --> 00:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
be submitted and we're not
 
00:39:04.150 --> 00:39:04.160 align:start position:0%
ending up in a situation where
 
00:39:05.829 --> 00:39:05.839 align:start position:0%
having to answer a large number of
 
00:39:07.430 --> 00:39:07.440 align:start position:0%
questions submit a large number of
 
00:39:10.150 --> 00:39:10.160 align:start position:0%
information at the outset
 
00:39:11.670 --> 00:39:11.680 align:start position:0%
ends up discouraging someone from
 
00:39:13.430 --> 00:39:13.440 align:start position:0%
participating in the process or or
 
00:39:15.030 --> 00:39:15.040 align:start position:0%
coming into the process in the first
 
00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:16.630 align:start position:0%
coming into the process in the first
place

00:39:16.630 --> 00:39:16.640 align:start position:0%
place
 
00:39:18.630 --> 00:39:18.640 align:start position:0%
so i i think the changes we've made here
 
00:39:20.390 --> 00:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
again while they're not they're not a
 
00:39:22.550 --> 00:39:22.560 align:start position:0%
large number of changes they're they're
 
00:39:24.310 --> 00:39:24.320 align:start position:0%
significant changes that make this
 
00:39:26.310 --> 00:39:26.320 align:start position:0%
process both more accessible
 
00:39:30.150 --> 00:39:30.160 align:start position:0%
and also address the most fundamental
 
00:39:31.670 --> 00:39:31.680 align:start position:0%
concerns i think we heard from many
 
00:39:33.829 --> 00:39:33.839 align:start position:0%
claimants council about how we're we're
 
00:39:37.670 --> 00:39:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:39.270 --> 00:39:39.280 align:start position:0%
we also had submitted to you a letter
 
00:39:40.630 --> 00:39:40.640 align:start position:0%
from the department of corrections and
 
00:39:42.550 --> 00:39:42.560 align:start position:0%
commissioner hanks was was kind enough
 
00:39:44.550 --> 00:39:44.560 align:start position:0%
to take the time to appear before you
 
00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:46.560 align:start position:0%
today to answer questions
 
00:39:49.589 --> 00:39:49.599 align:start position:0%
with regard to how how a resident at one
 
00:39:50.630 --> 00:39:50.640 align:start position:0%
of our
 
00:39:52.470 --> 00:39:52.480 align:start position:0%
one of our facilities might interact
 
00:39:54.790 --> 00:39:54.800 align:start position:0%
with this process
 
00:39:55.990 --> 00:39:56.000 align:start position:0%
so the department of corrections did
 
00:39:57.430 --> 00:39:57.440 align:start position:0%
submit a letter to you that just
 
00:39:57.440 --> 00:39:59.190 align:start position:0%
submit a letter to you that just
outlined

00:39:59.190 --> 00:39:59.200 align:start position:0%
outlined
 
00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:00.069 align:start position:0%
outlined
um

00:40:00.069 --> 00:40:00.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:01.990 --> 00:40:02.000 align:start position:0%
the process they would use for providing
 
00:40:03.510 --> 00:40:03.520 align:start position:0%
notice of something like this to
 
00:40:06.790 --> 00:40:06.800 align:start position:0%
residents and that letter discusses the
 
00:40:08.710 --> 00:40:08.720 align:start position:0%
the tablet method residents do have
 
00:40:10.950 --> 00:40:10.960 align:start position:0%
access to tablets and also closed
 
00:40:13.510 --> 00:40:13.520 align:start position:0%
circuit television and that letter noted
 
00:40:15.349 --> 00:40:15.359 align:start position:0%
that notice could be published even on a
 
00:40:17.030 --> 00:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
weekly notice of this process could be
 
00:40:19.190 --> 00:40:19.200 align:start position:0%
published even on a weekly basis
 
00:40:20.790 --> 00:40:20.800 align:start position:0%
and that the department of corrections
 
00:40:22.470 --> 00:40:22.480 align:start position:0%
would work with the administrator once
 
00:40:25.589 --> 00:40:25.599 align:start position:0%
that person is appointed on the language
 
00:40:27.430 --> 00:40:27.440 align:start position:0%
of that notice
 
00:40:28.710 --> 00:40:28.720 align:start position:0%
the department of corrections letter
 
00:40:31.349 --> 00:40:31.359 align:start position:0%
also noted that residents
 
00:40:33.510 --> 00:40:33.520 align:start position:0%
have access to facility libraries and
 
00:40:34.790 --> 00:40:34.800 align:start position:0%
it's through those facilities that they
 
00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:36.309 align:start position:0%
it's through those facilities that they
usually

00:40:36.309 --> 00:40:36.319 align:start position:0%
usually
 
00:40:38.150 --> 00:40:38.160 align:start position:0%
or they usually use those facilities to
 
00:40:40.950 --> 00:40:40.960 align:start position:0%
contact council
 
00:40:42.470 --> 00:40:42.480 align:start position:0%
and the department noted in their letter
 
00:40:43.990 --> 00:40:44.000 align:start position:0%
that they could make the list of
 
00:40:45.750 --> 00:40:45.760 align:start position:0%
available attorneys
 
00:40:47.829 --> 00:40:47.839 align:start position:0%
or or the published list of attorneys
 
00:40:49.829 --> 00:40:49.839 align:start position:0%
they could make that available
 
00:40:53.430 --> 00:40:53.440 align:start position:0%
through the tablet system
 
00:40:54.790 --> 00:40:54.800 align:start position:0%
the department also noted in their
 
00:40:57.430 --> 00:40:57.440 align:start position:0%
letter that residents who litigate have
 
00:40:59.670 --> 00:40:59.680 align:start position:0%
access to notaries through assigned
 
00:41:01.829 --> 00:41:01.839 align:start position:0%
counselors and case managers and that
 
00:41:03.510 --> 00:41:03.520 align:start position:0%
notary services would continue to be
 
00:41:05.510 --> 00:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
available to residents
 
00:41:07.030 --> 00:41:07.040 align:start position:0%
and that residents have access to a
 
00:41:08.470 --> 00:41:08.480 align:start position:0%
phone system
 
00:41:10.390 --> 00:41:10.400 align:start position:0%
the department did note that the
 
00:41:11.910 --> 00:41:11.920 align:start position:0%
administrator would need to be able to
 
00:41:14.230 --> 00:41:14.240 align:start position:0%
take accept collect calls but i'm sure
 
00:41:16.470 --> 00:41:16.480 align:start position:0%
we can work with the administrator
 
00:41:18.790 --> 00:41:18.800 align:start position:0%
to to make that happen
 
00:41:20.950 --> 00:41:20.960 align:start position:0%
the one thing the department did note is
 
00:41:24.309 --> 00:41:24.319 align:start position:0%
that residents do not have access to to
 
00:41:25.990 --> 00:41:26.000 align:start position:0%
in the internet
 
00:41:28.390 --> 00:41:28.400 align:start position:0%
and i um and that's something that would
 
00:41:30.470 --> 00:41:30.480 align:start position:0%
not change with this process
 
00:41:30.480 --> 00:41:31.430 align:start position:0%
not change with this process
but

00:41:31.430 --> 00:41:31.440 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:41:33.109 --> 00:41:33.119 align:start position:0%
i think as the department notes in their
 
00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
letter there are a number of other tools
 
00:41:36.790 --> 00:41:36.800 align:start position:0%
that can be made available to ensure
 
00:41:39.349 --> 00:41:39.359 align:start position:0%
that residents will will have access
 
00:41:42.950 --> 00:41:42.960 align:start position:0%
to getting their claim forms in and it
 
00:41:44.230 --> 00:41:44.240 align:start position:0%
we may be able to work with the
 
00:41:46.630 --> 00:41:46.640 align:start position:0%
department of corrections to to find
 
00:41:48.630 --> 00:41:48.640 align:start position:0%
some way to allow some type of
 
00:41:50.790 --> 00:41:50.800 align:start position:0%
electronic interaction with
 
00:41:53.109 --> 00:41:53.119 align:start position:0%
with this
 
00:41:55.510 --> 00:41:55.520 align:start position:0%
with this process but
 
00:41:56.790 --> 00:41:56.800 align:start position:0%
we'd have to have further discussion
 
00:41:58.309 --> 00:41:58.319 align:start position:0%
about that with the department and we'd
 
00:42:00.470 --> 00:42:00.480 align:start position:0%
have to of course balance
 
00:42:02.309 --> 00:42:02.319 align:start position:0%
the need to make this accessible to
 
00:42:03.910 --> 00:42:03.920 align:start position:0%
residents while not
 
00:42:07.270 --> 00:42:07.280 align:start position:0%
um not making any fundamental changes to
 
00:42:08.870 --> 00:42:08.880 align:start position:0%
current restrictions the department of
 
00:42:10.710 --> 00:42:10.720 align:start position:0%
corrections has in place
 
00:42:12.470 --> 00:42:12.480 align:start position:0%
because i i'm confident that there are
 
00:42:14.710 --> 00:42:14.720 align:start position:0%
very good reasons for
 
00:42:16.950 --> 00:42:16.960 align:start position:0%
for why the department of corrections
 
00:42:18.710 --> 00:42:18.720 align:start position:0%
has things set up the way they have it
 
00:42:20.630 --> 00:42:20.640 align:start position:0%
currently set up so the commissioner of
 
00:42:22.309 --> 00:42:22.319 align:start position:0%
corrections is here again to answer any
 
00:42:23.430 --> 00:42:23.440 align:start position:0%
further questions on that if the
 
00:42:24.870 --> 00:42:24.880 align:start position:0%
committee has questions but i just
 
00:42:26.950 --> 00:42:26.960 align:start position:0%
wanted to outline what the department
 
00:42:30.230 --> 00:42:30.240 align:start position:0%
had provided in their letter
 
00:42:32.309 --> 00:42:32.319 align:start position:0%
in addition to
 
00:42:35.430 --> 00:42:35.440 align:start position:0%
the changes i've just noted here we did
 
00:42:37.190 --> 00:42:37.200 align:start position:0%
you know also try to go through these
 
00:42:39.030 --> 00:42:39.040 align:start position:0%
documents and make any type
 
00:42:41.829 --> 00:42:41.839 align:start position:0%
typographical errors um i'm hoping we
 
00:42:43.190 --> 00:42:43.200 align:start position:0%
caught all of them
 
00:42:45.270 --> 00:42:45.280 align:start position:0%
if we i think there were a couple that
 
00:42:46.950 --> 00:42:46.960 align:start position:0%
we missed that representative lin has
 
00:42:49.349 --> 00:42:49.359 align:start position:0%
already pointed out but
 
00:42:52.069 --> 00:42:52.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:54.630 --> 00:42:54.640 align:start position:0%
make sure that those are
 
00:42:57.270 --> 00:42:57.280 align:start position:0%
if the committee would permit us to make
 
00:43:00.470 --> 00:43:00.480 align:start position:0%
only typo type corrections not anything
 
00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:01.829 align:start position:0%
only typo type corrections not anything
else

00:43:01.829 --> 00:43:01.839 align:start position:0%
else
 
00:43:03.589 --> 00:43:03.599 align:start position:0%
so we have not asked for
 
00:43:04.870 --> 00:43:04.880 align:start position:0%
permission to make you know
 
00:43:07.030 --> 00:43:07.040 align:start position:0%
non-substantive changes or anything like
 
00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:07.829 align:start position:0%
non-substantive changes or anything like
that

00:43:07.829 --> 00:43:07.839 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:43:10.230 --> 00:43:10.240 align:start position:0%
i would propose that the committee
 
00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:11.510 align:start position:0%
i would propose that the committee
give

00:43:11.510 --> 00:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
give
 
00:43:14.069 --> 00:43:14.079 align:start position:0%
the department of justice um
 
00:43:16.710 --> 00:43:16.720 align:start position:0%
the authority only to make what would be
 
00:43:19.109 --> 00:43:19.119 align:start position:0%
what would be typographical corrections
 
00:43:21.030 --> 00:43:21.040 align:start position:0%
so that we can address any
 
00:43:24.470 --> 00:43:24.480 align:start position:0%
any typos that we might find but
 
00:43:26.150 --> 00:43:26.160 align:start position:0%
we can also bootstrap that with the
 
00:43:28.069 --> 00:43:28.079 align:start position:0%
administrator if the administrator finds
 
00:43:30.309 --> 00:43:30.319 align:start position:0%
any more significant tweaks that are
 
00:43:31.910 --> 00:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
needed the administrator once that
 
00:43:33.190 --> 00:43:33.200 align:start position:0%
person is appointed will have the
 
00:43:35.670 --> 00:43:35.680 align:start position:0%
authority to come back to fiscal and ask
 
00:43:37.670 --> 00:43:37.680 align:start position:0%
for those changes and as i mentioned
 
00:43:39.670 --> 00:43:39.680 align:start position:0%
earlier i think that
 
00:43:41.510 --> 00:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
the administrator coming back to ask for
 
00:43:43.670 --> 00:43:43.680 align:start position:0%
those changes probably gives even more
 
00:43:45.190 --> 00:43:45.200 align:start position:0%
comfort to claimants because the
 
00:43:46.710 --> 00:43:46.720 align:start position:0%
administrator will be
 
00:43:49.190 --> 00:43:49.200 align:start position:0%
will be the the objective third party in
 
00:43:51.829 --> 00:43:51.839 align:start position:0%
this process
 
00:43:53.109 --> 00:43:53.119 align:start position:0%
with that those are those are the
 
00:43:55.030 --> 00:43:55.040 align:start position:0%
changes we've made
 
00:43:57.030 --> 00:43:57.040 align:start position:0%
i just want to say i really appreciate
 
00:43:58.630 --> 00:43:58.640 align:start position:0%
the conversation we had at the last
 
00:44:00.470 --> 00:44:00.480 align:start position:0%
meeting i think we got a lot of good
 
00:44:01.750 --> 00:44:01.760 align:start position:0%
feedback we had some really good
 
00:44:03.349 --> 00:44:03.359 align:start position:0%
discussion on how to make this process
 
00:44:03.359 --> 00:44:04.470 align:start position:0%
discussion on how to make this process
better

00:44:04.470 --> 00:44:04.480 align:start position:0%
better
 
00:44:06.230 --> 00:44:06.240 align:start position:0%
i really appreciate the conversations
 
00:44:07.829 --> 00:44:07.839 align:start position:0%
we've had with claimants council
 
00:44:09.750 --> 00:44:09.760 align:start position:0%
especially since the last meeting i
 
00:44:11.190 --> 00:44:11.200 align:start position:0%
think we had very thoughtful and
 
00:44:13.190 --> 00:44:13.200 align:start position:0%
productive discussions i want to
 
00:44:14.790 --> 00:44:14.800 align:start position:0%
particularly recognize senior assistant
 
00:44:16.550 --> 00:44:16.560 align:start position:0%
attorney general jen ramsey who you all
 
00:44:18.790 --> 00:44:18.800 align:start position:0%
know who is here today i think she has
 
00:44:20.790 --> 00:44:20.800 align:start position:0%
done an excellent job in really taking
 
00:44:22.710 --> 00:44:22.720 align:start position:0%
the lead in in facilitating those
 
00:44:24.950 --> 00:44:24.960 align:start position:0%
discussions she's spent hours
 
00:44:27.270 --> 00:44:27.280 align:start position:0%
hours with these guys really trying to
 
00:44:29.829 --> 00:44:29.839 align:start position:0%
to find solutions where we can
 
00:44:31.670 --> 00:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
to again make this process one that is
 
00:44:33.589 --> 00:44:33.599 align:start position:0%
not perfect
 
00:44:36.950 --> 00:44:36.960 align:start position:0%
it will not work for every claimant but
 
00:44:38.790 --> 00:44:38.800 align:start position:0%
i think what you have before you is a
 
00:44:42.309 --> 00:44:42.319 align:start position:0%
process that can work for many claimants
 
00:44:43.829 --> 00:44:43.839 align:start position:0%
many victims
 
00:44:46.630 --> 00:44:46.640 align:start position:0%
and and give give them at least an
 
00:44:48.870 --> 00:44:48.880 align:start position:0%
option that is far more
 
00:44:50.870 --> 00:44:50.880 align:start position:0%
victim-centered and trauma-informed than
 
00:44:52.710 --> 00:44:52.720 align:start position:0%
traditional litigation i think that's
 
00:44:54.230 --> 00:44:54.240 align:start position:0%
reflected in the letters that you've
 
00:44:56.069 --> 00:44:56.079 align:start position:0%
received from some claimants counsel i
 
00:44:57.510 --> 00:44:57.520 align:start position:0%
think that's also reflected in the
 
00:44:59.750 --> 00:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
indications we've gotten from claimants
 
00:45:01.270 --> 00:45:01.280 align:start position:0%
counsel who while they haven't submitted
 
00:45:03.670 --> 00:45:03.680 align:start position:0%
a letter do believe that they have many
 
00:45:06.069 --> 00:45:06.079 align:start position:0%
clients who can use this process
 
00:45:08.150 --> 00:45:08.160 align:start position:0%
so with that i'm happy to take any
 
00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:10.390 align:start position:0%
so with that i'm happy to take any
questions

00:45:10.390 --> 00:45:10.400 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:45:11.829 --> 00:45:11.839 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from the
 
00:45:11.839 --> 00:45:15.510 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from the
committee

00:45:15.510 --> 00:45:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:15.520 --> 00:45:16.829 align:start position:0%
 
represent

00:45:16.829 --> 00:45:16.839 align:start position:0%
represent
 
00:45:20.870 --> 00:45:20.880 align:start position:0%
lynn thank you madam chair um yes i uh
 
00:45:22.309 --> 00:45:22.319 align:start position:0%
first of all i want to say i think dude

00:45:27.349 --> 00:45:27.359 align:start position:0%
job in this um
 
00:45:28.710 --> 00:45:28.720 align:start position:0%

00:45:31.430 --> 00:45:31.440 align:start position:0%
i i have no i have really no
 
00:45:34.630 --> 00:45:34.640 align:start position:0%
uh substantive to the issues and with
 
00:45:36.870 --> 00:45:36.880 align:start position:0%
regard to the to the typo kind of things
 
00:45:39.910 --> 00:45:39.920 align:start position:0%
i mean that's just that that that
 
00:45:41.349 --> 00:45:41.359 align:start position:0%
it's entirely
 
00:45:43.109 --> 00:45:43.119 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's very easy to see how that
 
00:45:44.230 --> 00:45:44.240 align:start position:0%
kind of thing could happen and i
 
00:45:45.430 --> 00:45:45.440 align:start position:0%
personally i don't know why the rest of
 
00:45:47.030 --> 00:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
the committee i have no problem at all
 
00:45:49.349 --> 00:45:49.359 align:start position:0%
with saying that non-substantive
 
00:45:51.190 --> 00:45:51.200 align:start position:0%
typo correction kind of things can be
 
00:45:52.630 --> 00:45:52.640 align:start position:0%
should be able to be done
 
00:45:54.790 --> 00:45:54.800 align:start position:0%
um if i could though i'd like to ask
 
00:45:56.630 --> 00:45:56.640 align:start position:0%
just a couple of questions
 
00:46:00.510 --> 00:46:00.520 align:start position:0%
um and i refer specifically to fis
 
00:46:03.670 --> 00:46:03.680 align:start position:0%
309 which is the
 
00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:05.030 align:start position:0%
309 which is the
guidelines

00:46:05.030 --> 00:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
guidelines
 
00:46:05.040 --> 00:46:06.069 align:start position:0%
guidelines
um

00:46:06.069 --> 00:46:06.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:09.349 --> 00:46:09.359 align:start position:0%
and in particular um
 
00:46:11.829 --> 00:46:11.839 align:start position:0%
my understanding i base my this question
 
00:46:13.510 --> 00:46:13.520 align:start position:0%
on a discussion i had with attorney
 
00:46:15.430 --> 00:46:15.440 align:start position:0%
scolambrini who i see in the back of the
 
00:46:16.390 --> 00:46:16.400 align:start position:0%
room and i think you've probably
 
00:46:17.990 --> 00:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
discussed it with him also
 
00:46:19.910 --> 00:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
one of the things that he points out and
 
00:46:21.990 --> 00:46:22.000 align:start position:0%
i think it's a fair
 
00:46:24.150 --> 00:46:24.160 align:start position:0%
point to make although
 
00:46:26.069 --> 00:46:26.079 align:start position:0%
i'm not quite sure what the i'm not
 
00:46:27.829 --> 00:46:27.839 align:start position:0%
suggesting that necessary that changes
 
00:46:29.349 --> 00:46:29.359 align:start position:0%
have to be made i'm not suggesting that
 
00:46:31.510 --> 00:46:31.520 align:start position:0%
but i do think it's something that ought
 
00:46:32.950 --> 00:46:32.960 align:start position:0%
to be sort of
 
00:46:34.790 --> 00:46:34.800 align:start position:0%
on the record so to speak and something
 
00:46:36.309 --> 00:46:36.319 align:start position:0%
that the administrator ought to take
 
00:46:37.589 --> 00:46:37.599 align:start position:0%
into account
 
00:46:42.630 --> 00:46:42.640 align:start position:0%
is that um in the categorization of um
 
00:46:44.390 --> 00:46:44.400 align:start position:0%
the levels of abuse
 
00:46:45.910 --> 00:46:45.920 align:start position:0%
i'm on page
 
00:46:45.920 --> 00:46:46.790 align:start position:0%
i'm on page
five

00:46:46.790 --> 00:46:46.800 align:start position:0%
five
 
00:46:48.069 --> 00:46:48.079 align:start position:0%
of uh
 
00:46:48.079 --> 00:46:49.349 align:start position:0%
of uh
309

00:46:49.349 --> 00:46:49.359 align:start position:0%
309
 
00:46:53.109 --> 00:46:53.119 align:start position:0%
in the in the categorization of
 
00:46:54.950 --> 00:46:54.960 align:start position:0%
of abuse
 
00:46:57.109 --> 00:46:57.119 align:start position:0%
um well and actually i should say maybe
 
00:46:59.270 --> 00:46:59.280 align:start position:0%
because it also goes back to page two
 
00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:00.470 align:start position:0%
because it also goes back to page two
um

00:47:00.470 --> 00:47:00.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:01.349 align:start position:0%
um
the

00:47:01.349 --> 00:47:01.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:47:01.359 --> 00:47:03.829 align:start position:0%
the
um

00:47:03.829 --> 00:47:03.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:05.910 --> 00:47:05.920 align:start position:0%
key point attorney solembrini points out
 
00:47:08.150 --> 00:47:08.160 align:start position:0%
i think correctly that there
 
00:47:10.870 --> 00:47:10.880 align:start position:0%
at least arguably could be
 
00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:11.910 align:start position:0%
at least arguably could be
um

00:47:11.910 --> 00:47:11.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:13.990 --> 00:47:14.000 align:start position:0%
situations in which
 
00:47:16.790 --> 00:47:16.800 align:start position:0%
the abuse in which
 
00:47:19.430 --> 00:47:19.440 align:start position:0%
sort of a similar level of abuse
 
00:47:21.990 --> 00:47:22.000 align:start position:0%
of a male victim versus a female victim
 
00:47:23.990 --> 00:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
might be treated differently and what in
 
00:47:27.270 --> 00:47:27.280 align:start position:0%
particular what he points out is that
 
00:47:29.270 --> 00:47:29.280 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:30.790 align:start position:0%
in terms of
digital

00:47:30.790 --> 00:47:30.800 align:start position:0%
digital
 
00:47:34.710 --> 00:47:34.720 align:start position:0%
abuse of a female it's almost any
 
00:47:37.030 --> 00:47:37.040 align:start position:0%
touching of female genitalia is very
 
00:47:38.790 --> 00:47:38.800 align:start position:0%
likely to involve some kind of
 
00:47:41.109 --> 00:47:41.119 align:start position:0%
penetration which would bring it into
 
00:47:42.790 --> 00:47:42.800 align:start position:0%
category a
 
00:47:45.570 --> 00:47:45.580 align:start position:0%
whereas with a male victim
 
00:47:45.580 --> 00:47:46.870 align:start position:0%
whereas with a male victim
[Music]

00:47:46.870 --> 00:47:46.880 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:47:49.270 --> 00:47:49.280 align:start position:0%
a touching of let's say a touching of a
 
00:47:51.829 --> 00:47:51.839 align:start position:0%
male penis would not involve it would
 
00:47:53.589 --> 00:47:53.599 align:start position:0%
not involve penetration which there
 
00:47:55.670 --> 00:47:55.680 align:start position:0%
would therefore mean that it would be in
 
00:47:57.190 --> 00:47:57.200 align:start position:0%
category c
 
00:47:59.270 --> 00:47:59.280 align:start position:0%
and depending on the circumstances those
 
00:48:01.190 --> 00:48:01.200 align:start position:0%
could there could be it's easy to
 
00:48:03.270 --> 00:48:03.280 align:start position:0%
imagine situations in which
 
00:48:05.990 --> 00:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
the the that the same sort of level of
 
00:48:08.150 --> 00:48:08.160 align:start position:0%
abuse would be treated differently i'm
 
00:48:09.589 --> 00:48:09.599 align:start position:0%
not sure there's a
 
00:48:11.589 --> 00:48:11.599 align:start position:0%
good answer to that but i think it's
 
00:48:13.589 --> 00:48:13.599 align:start position:0%
something that the administrator
 
00:48:15.349 --> 00:48:15.359 align:start position:0%
you know ought to take in mind perhaps
 
00:48:18.150 --> 00:48:18.160 align:start position:0%
in evaluating in evaluating individual
 
00:48:20.549 --> 00:48:20.559 align:start position:0%
claims um i don't know if you had any
 
00:48:22.710 --> 00:48:22.720 align:start position:0%
comment on that
 
00:48:25.430 --> 00:48:25.440 align:start position:0%
yeah i i think i would i would agree
 
00:48:26.870 --> 00:48:26.880 align:start position:0%
that that that is something the
 
00:48:28.630 --> 00:48:28.640 align:start position:0%
administrator could take into account
 
00:48:31.030 --> 00:48:31.040 align:start position:0%
and and to the extent you know i i don't
 
00:48:32.870 --> 00:48:32.880 align:start position:0%
have any
 
00:48:34.470 --> 00:48:34.480 align:start position:0%
changes that i feel like i could sit
 
00:48:36.309 --> 00:48:36.319 align:start position:0%
here and comfortably say i i think would
 
00:48:38.150 --> 00:48:38.160 align:start position:0%
address that that would be appropriate
 
00:48:38.160 --> 00:48:39.349 align:start position:0%
address that that would be appropriate
but

00:48:39.349 --> 00:48:39.359 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:48:42.069 --> 00:48:42.079 align:start position:0%
i i would say i would again kind of
 
00:48:44.390 --> 00:48:44.400 align:start position:0%
say that the administrator
 
00:48:45.829 --> 00:48:45.839 align:start position:0%
once that person is appointed would have
 
00:48:46.870 --> 00:48:46.880 align:start position:0%
the ability to come back to this
 
00:48:48.950 --> 00:48:48.960 align:start position:0%
committee and and request changes and
 
00:48:51.430 --> 00:48:51.440 align:start position:0%
there may through further discussion be
 
00:48:52.870 --> 00:48:52.880 align:start position:0%
be something that could be developed on
 
00:48:55.270 --> 00:48:55.280 align:start position:0%
that front but we did discuss that issue
 
00:48:56.870 --> 00:48:56.880 align:start position:0%
with attorney scolombrini and we were
 
00:48:58.630 --> 00:48:58.640 align:start position:0%
not able to arrive at any
 
00:49:00.390 --> 00:49:00.400 align:start position:0%
changes that we thought could could
 
00:49:04.150 --> 00:49:04.160 align:start position:0%
address that issue but but i i certainly
 
00:49:06.470 --> 00:49:06.480 align:start position:0%
the point was was taken and i think it's
 
00:49:07.510 --> 00:49:07.520 align:start position:0%
something that
 
00:49:10.150 --> 00:49:10.160 align:start position:0%
deserves potential future or further
 
00:49:13.349 --> 00:49:13.359 align:start position:0%
consideration all right let me ask one
 
00:49:14.870 --> 00:49:14.880 align:start position:0%
question and then the other thing this
 
00:49:16.549 --> 00:49:16.559 align:start position:0%
is this is it's a little bit different
 
00:49:18.870 --> 00:49:18.880 align:start position:0%
but somewhat related you may recall that
 
00:49:21.510 --> 00:49:21.520 align:start position:0%
that i had asked a question um the last
 
00:49:23.589 --> 00:49:23.599 align:start position:0%
time about whether
 
00:49:25.109 --> 00:49:25.119 align:start position:0%
um there was
 
00:49:27.750 --> 00:49:27.760 align:start position:0%
there was really any difference
 
00:49:30.309 --> 00:49:30.319 align:start position:0%
with regard to i'm back on page two
 
00:49:30.319 --> 00:49:31.430 align:start position:0%
with regard to i'm back on page two
between

00:49:31.430 --> 00:49:31.440 align:start position:0%
between
 
00:49:31.440 --> 00:49:33.109 align:start position:0%
between
uh

00:49:33.109 --> 00:49:33.119 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:49:35.349 --> 00:49:35.359 align:start position:0%
category c intimate sexual touching
 
00:49:37.750 --> 00:49:37.760 align:start position:0%
parenthesis masturbation and then d
 
00:49:40.870 --> 00:49:40.880 align:start position:0%
other touchings and i think miss ramsey
 
00:49:43.109 --> 00:49:43.119 align:start position:0%
correctly pointed out that there is a
 
00:49:45.589 --> 00:49:45.599 align:start position:0%
difference in the definitions in the
 
00:49:47.910 --> 00:49:47.920 align:start position:0%
guidelines and i and i i completely
 
00:49:49.430 --> 00:49:49.440 align:start position:0%
agree with the definite distinction
 
00:49:51.670 --> 00:49:51.680 align:start position:0%
she's pointed out um
 
00:49:51.680 --> 00:49:52.390 align:start position:0%
she's pointed out um
but

00:49:52.390 --> 00:49:52.400 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:49:52.400 --> 00:49:53.510 align:start position:0%
but
what

00:49:53.510 --> 00:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:49:55.829 --> 00:49:55.839 align:start position:0%
what that's what that does
 
00:49:57.510 --> 00:49:57.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't completely address is that
 
00:49:58.950 --> 00:49:58.960 align:start position:0%
they're now
 
00:50:01.030 --> 00:50:01.040 align:start position:0%
there are overlaps
 
00:50:04.630 --> 00:50:04.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:06.549 --> 00:50:06.559 align:start position:0%
c and d in other words there's some
 
00:50:08.470 --> 00:50:08.480 align:start position:0%
things that could be categorized either
 
00:50:10.150 --> 00:50:10.160 align:start position:0%
as falling into d
 
00:50:13.030 --> 00:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
or falling into c and i again assume
 
00:50:15.030 --> 00:50:15.040 align:start position:0%
that the admit that
 
00:50:17.750 --> 00:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
that you know whether it falls into d or
 
00:50:20.549 --> 00:50:20.559 align:start position:0%
c in some sense would involve
 
00:50:23.030 --> 00:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
the the administrator determining how
 
00:50:25.430 --> 00:50:25.440 align:start position:0%
how significant was this
 
00:50:28.309 --> 00:50:28.319 align:start position:0%
particular incident of abuse and that is
 
00:50:30.390 --> 00:50:30.400 align:start position:0%
i mean is that your understanding also
 
00:50:32.710 --> 00:50:32.720 align:start position:0%
yes i i think that's
 
00:50:35.109 --> 00:50:35.119 align:start position:0%
you know yes i think that's an area
 
00:50:36.950 --> 00:50:36.960 align:start position:0%
where the administrator will will just
 
00:50:38.710 --> 00:50:38.720 align:start position:0%
have to make some determinations based
 
00:50:42.069 --> 00:50:42.079 align:start position:0%
on the specific facts of a case
 
00:50:42.950 --> 00:50:42.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:50:43.910 --> 00:50:43.920 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:50:45.589 --> 00:50:45.599 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry just the only thing i want to
 
00:50:47.829 --> 00:50:47.839 align:start position:0%
point out was just the uh the
 
00:50:50.470 --> 00:50:50.480 align:start position:0%
i saw the typos if that's if that's okay
 
00:50:53.670 --> 00:50:53.680 align:start position:0%
um so i guess i would say um in terms of
 
00:50:53.680 --> 00:50:54.630 align:start position:0%
um so i guess i would say um in terms of
uh

00:50:54.630 --> 00:50:54.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:50:58.549 --> 00:50:58.559 align:start position:0%
on again on on document 22 309
 
00:51:01.190 --> 00:51:01.200 align:start position:0%
um the um
 
00:51:03.030 --> 00:51:03.040 align:start position:0%
the typos that i think need to be
 
00:51:09.670 --> 00:51:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:12.069 --> 00:51:12.079 align:start position:0%
oh no i'm sorry
 
00:51:15.910 --> 00:51:15.920 align:start position:0%
should be on 310 i'm sorry uh fs
 
00:51:18.150 --> 00:51:18.160 align:start position:0%
fis 22 310
 
00:51:19.109 --> 00:51:19.119 align:start position:0%
think that
 
00:51:21.270 --> 00:51:21.280 align:start position:0%
typos that need to be corrected are on
 
00:51:24.870 --> 00:51:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:29.990 --> 00:51:30.000 align:start position:0%
uh in the in the num number three
 
00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:30.870 align:start position:0%
uh in the in the num number three
um

00:51:30.870 --> 00:51:30.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:34.069 --> 00:51:34.079 align:start position:0%
it says how old were how old you were
 
00:51:38.470 --> 00:51:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:40.790 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:51:40.790 --> 00:51:40.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:51:42.630 --> 00:51:42.640 align:start position:0%
i think the first you should go or maybe
 
00:51:46.309 --> 00:51:46.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:49.270 --> 00:51:49.280 align:start position:0%
um and then on page
 
00:51:53.109 --> 00:51:53.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:54.950 --> 00:51:54.960 align:start position:0%
the worksheet one
 
00:51:57.750 --> 00:51:57.760 align:start position:0%
yeah the worksheet one yeah um i think
 
00:51:57.760 --> 00:51:58.790 align:start position:0%
yeah the worksheet one yeah um i think
there

00:51:58.790 --> 00:51:58.800 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:51:58.800 --> 00:52:01.109 align:start position:0%
there
um

00:52:01.109 --> 00:52:01.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:03.030 --> 00:52:03.040 align:start position:0%
it it it says
 
00:52:05.910 --> 00:52:05.920 align:start position:0%
we're talking about category c
 
00:52:08.870 --> 00:52:08.880 align:start position:0%
but the lines say right in category a
 
00:52:10.470 --> 00:52:10.480 align:start position:0%
and it really really
 
00:52:12.470 --> 00:52:12.480 align:start position:0%
in the first line it should be write the
 
00:52:14.630 --> 00:52:14.640 align:start position:0%
number of incidents of category c the
 
00:52:16.069 --> 00:52:16.079 align:start position:0%
second line should say write the number
 
00:52:19.109 --> 00:52:19.119 align:start position:0%
of incidents of category d rather than b
 
00:52:20.870 --> 00:52:20.880 align:start position:0%
the third one write the number of
 
00:52:23.670 --> 00:52:23.680 align:start position:0%
instances of category e rather than c
 
00:52:25.990 --> 00:52:26.000 align:start position:0%
and then the next line down add
 
00:52:28.150 --> 00:52:28.160 align:start position:0%
incidence of d and e i think that's i
 
00:52:29.750 --> 00:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
think that's right that's
 
00:52:29.760 --> 00:52:30.950 align:start position:0%
think that's right that's
simple

00:52:30.950 --> 00:52:30.960 align:start position:0%
simple
 
00:52:33.750 --> 00:52:33.760 align:start position:0%
uh and i think there was one more that i
 
00:52:36.470 --> 00:52:36.480 align:start position:0%
pointed out to miss ramsay but just uh
 
00:52:39.829 --> 00:52:39.839 align:start position:0%
oh in the on page uh
 
00:52:42.230 --> 00:52:42.240 align:start position:0%
the next to last page in the uh notice
 
00:52:43.589 --> 00:52:43.599 align:start position:0%
of filing
 
00:52:45.589 --> 00:52:45.599 align:start position:0%
again i think there's just a typo on the
 
00:52:48.230 --> 00:52:48.240 align:start position:0%
second line there where it says uh
 
00:52:51.910 --> 00:52:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:53.670 --> 00:52:53.680 align:start position:0%
the word for is there but shouldn't be
 
00:52:55.190 --> 00:52:55.200 align:start position:0%
there should i have filed a claim with
 
00:52:56.950 --> 00:52:56.960 align:start position:0%
the administrator i think so there's
 
00:52:59.030 --> 00:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
just an extra word there other than that
 
00:53:01.829 --> 00:53:01.839 align:start position:0%
um as i say i think this is uh
 
00:53:03.349 --> 00:53:03.359 align:start position:0%
i think you guys have done an
 
00:53:05.910 --> 00:53:05.920 align:start position:0%
extraordinary amount of work and it's uh
 
00:53:07.030 --> 00:53:07.040 align:start position:0%
it looks
 
00:53:09.349 --> 00:53:09.359 align:start position:0%
it looks very good to me and i plan to
 
00:53:12.470 --> 00:53:12.480 align:start position:0%
vote yes to accept it
 
00:53:15.030 --> 00:53:15.040 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions uh
 
00:53:17.109 --> 00:53:17.119 align:start position:0%
senator rosenwald thank you madam chair
 
00:53:19.430 --> 00:53:19.440 align:start position:0%
i do have a few questions
 
00:53:19.440 --> 00:53:20.309 align:start position:0%
i do have a few questions
um

00:53:20.309 --> 00:53:20.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:23.030 --> 00:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
good morning thanks for being back here
 
00:53:25.670 --> 00:53:25.680 align:start position:0%
um first i'd like to ask how much you
 
00:53:25.680 --> 00:53:27.030 align:start position:0%
um first i'd like to ask how much you
expect

00:53:27.030 --> 00:53:27.040 align:start position:0%
expect
 
00:53:30.230 --> 00:53:30.240 align:start position:0%
to pay both the administrator
 
00:53:33.030 --> 00:53:33.040 align:start position:0%
and the private law firm that you've
 
00:53:35.270 --> 00:53:35.280 align:start position:0%
hired out of the fund i'm wondering how
 
00:53:37.430 --> 00:53:37.440 align:start position:0%
much money will actually be
 
00:53:40.549 --> 00:53:40.559 align:start position:0%
available after those expenses to settle
 
00:53:40.559 --> 00:53:42.150 align:start position:0%
available after those expenses to settle
claims

00:53:42.150 --> 00:53:42.160 align:start position:0%
claims
 
00:53:43.510 --> 00:53:43.520 align:start position:0%
so the
 
00:53:46.069 --> 00:53:46.079 align:start position:0%
the administrator is
 
00:53:48.309 --> 00:53:48.319 align:start position:0%
can be a part-time or full-time employee
 
00:53:50.710 --> 00:53:50.720 align:start position:0%
and paid at this at the same salary or
 
00:53:52.870 --> 00:53:52.880 align:start position:0%
no more than a superior court judge i
 
00:53:55.670 --> 00:53:55.680 align:start position:0%
believe is what the statute says so
 
00:53:57.910 --> 00:53:57.920 align:start position:0%
and so if if the administrator's
 
00:53:59.349 --> 00:53:59.359 align:start position:0%
full-time they'll probably be paid
 
00:54:00.950 --> 00:54:00.960 align:start position:0%
around the same salary as a superior
 
00:54:02.549 --> 00:54:02.559 align:start position:0%
court judge if they're part-time they'll
 
00:54:04.790 --> 00:54:04.800 align:start position:0%
be paid at whatever that same rate would
 
00:54:04.800 --> 00:54:05.589 align:start position:0%
be paid at whatever that same rate would
be

00:54:05.589 --> 00:54:05.599 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:54:07.270 --> 00:54:07.280 align:start position:0%
so calculate that out to be an hourly
 
00:54:10.309 --> 00:54:10.319 align:start position:0%
rate they'll be paid around that rate
 
00:54:13.750 --> 00:54:13.760 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch may need to
 
00:54:16.069 --> 00:54:16.079 align:start position:0%
hire additional staff
 
00:54:17.829 --> 00:54:17.839 align:start position:0%
to help the administrator which would
 
00:54:19.750 --> 00:54:19.760 align:start position:0%
come out of the fund
 
00:54:19.760 --> 00:54:21.750 align:start position:0%
come out of the fund
so

00:54:21.750 --> 00:54:21.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:54:23.109 --> 00:54:23.119 align:start position:0%
you know superior court judge i believe
 
00:54:26.710 --> 00:54:26.720 align:start position:0%
makes around 170 180 000 a year
 
00:54:29.510 --> 00:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
then if you add in benefits
 
00:54:30.790 --> 00:54:30.800 align:start position:0%
i think it would be a few hundred
 
00:54:32.549 --> 00:54:32.559 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars for administrator and
 
00:54:34.470 --> 00:54:34.480 align:start position:0%
their staff i don't expect to be more
 
00:54:36.309 --> 00:54:36.319 align:start position:0%
than a million a year but probably in
 
00:54:38.870 --> 00:54:38.880 align:start position:0%
the hundreds of thousands per year
 
00:54:41.510 --> 00:54:41.520 align:start position:0%
and then as far as the
 
00:54:44.230 --> 00:54:44.240 align:start position:0%
outside counsel we've retained for
 
00:54:44.240 --> 00:54:46.710 align:start position:0%
outside counsel we've retained for
the

00:54:46.710 --> 00:54:46.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:50.069 --> 00:54:50.079 align:start position:0%
the settlement process
 
00:54:52.309 --> 00:54:52.319 align:start position:0%
i don't expect that that would be more
 
00:54:54.630 --> 00:54:54.640 align:start position:0%
than a million dollars a year
 
00:54:54.640 --> 00:54:55.670 align:start position:0%
than a million dollars a year
um

00:54:55.670 --> 00:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:58.710 --> 00:54:58.720 align:start position:0%
it's gonna sort of depend on
 
00:55:00.309 --> 00:55:00.319 align:start position:0%
how many
 
00:55:02.549 --> 00:55:02.559 align:start position:0%
how many claims we get in
 
00:55:04.630 --> 00:55:04.640 align:start position:0%
and what this really looks like as we
 
00:55:06.470 --> 00:55:06.480 align:start position:0%
ramp up but we have not
 
00:55:08.230 --> 00:55:08.240 align:start position:0%
i don't expect that we would spend more
 
00:55:10.309 --> 00:55:10.319 align:start position:0%
than a million dollars a year on outside
 
00:55:12.230 --> 00:55:12.240 align:start position:0%
assistance and even that is i'm not
 
00:55:13.510 --> 00:55:13.520 align:start position:0%
saying that we think it would approach a
 
00:55:15.190 --> 00:55:15.200 align:start position:0%
million a year but to give you an
 
00:55:17.190 --> 00:55:17.200 align:start position:0%
estimate that with some certainty i just
 
00:55:20.549 --> 00:55:20.559 align:start position:0%
want to be very so total of up to four
 
00:55:20.559 --> 00:55:21.589 align:start position:0%
want to be very so total of up to four
million

00:55:21.589 --> 00:55:21.599 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:55:24.470 --> 00:55:24.480 align:start position:0%
between the administrator
 
00:55:26.549 --> 00:55:26.559 align:start position:0%
and the law firm because it's a two-year
 
00:55:26.559 --> 00:55:29.270 align:start position:0%
and the law firm because it's a two-year
process

00:55:29.270 --> 00:55:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:33.430 --> 00:55:33.440 align:start position:0%
yes okay so um thank you can i thank you
 
00:55:35.349 --> 00:55:35.359 align:start position:0%
let's let me just let me just say one
 
00:55:38.150 --> 00:55:38.160 align:start position:0%
thing on that it may go longer than two
 
00:55:38.160 --> 00:55:39.190 align:start position:0%
thing on that it may go longer than two
years

00:55:39.190 --> 00:55:39.200 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:55:41.910 --> 00:55:41.920 align:start position:0%
because two years is the application
 
00:55:41.920 --> 00:55:43.030 align:start position:0%
because two years is the application
process

00:55:43.030 --> 00:55:43.040 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:55:45.670 --> 00:55:45.680 align:start position:0%
and so if someone applies
 
00:55:47.750 --> 00:55:47.760 align:start position:0%
in december of
 
00:55:51.589 --> 00:55:51.599 align:start position:0%
24 that may in fact run a little bit
 
00:55:54.470 --> 00:55:54.480 align:start position:0%
longer right or you know some amount of
 
00:55:55.750 --> 00:55:55.760 align:start position:0%
time so
 
00:55:57.750 --> 00:55:57.760 align:start position:0%
i i think that
 
00:56:01.030 --> 00:56:01.040 align:start position:0%
the attorney general is is correct that
 
00:56:03.829 --> 00:56:03.839 align:start position:0%
we're probably looking at four million
 
00:56:05.109 --> 00:56:05.119 align:start position:0%
even though
 
00:56:07.430 --> 00:56:07.440 align:start position:0%
it could be more than two years right
 
00:56:09.030 --> 00:56:09.040 align:start position:0%
okay and we'll of course try to keep
 
00:56:10.950 --> 00:56:10.960 align:start position:0%
that number as low as we
 
00:56:12.789 --> 00:56:12.799 align:start position:0%
of course
 
00:56:15.270 --> 00:56:15.280 align:start position:0%
um so the last time you were here you
 
00:56:16.470 --> 00:56:16.480 align:start position:0%
told us
 
00:56:19.030 --> 00:56:19.040 align:start position:0%
that you had in mind
 
00:56:22.309 --> 00:56:22.319 align:start position:0%
an average maximum award of
 
00:56:24.870 --> 00:56:24.880 align:start position:0%
uh between six and seven
 
00:56:27.510 --> 00:56:27.520 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars or in other
 
00:56:29.829 --> 00:56:29.839 align:start position:0%
words less than fifty percent of the
 
00:56:31.910 --> 00:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
statutory cap
 
00:56:31.920 --> 00:56:33.510 align:start position:0%
statutory cap
um

00:56:33.510 --> 00:56:33.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:36.309 --> 00:56:36.319 align:start position:0%
and that you made the multipliers and
 
00:56:38.309 --> 00:56:38.319 align:start position:0%
aggravating factors
 
00:56:41.910 --> 00:56:41.920 align:start position:0%
work to achieve that are you still
 
00:56:41.920 --> 00:56:43.589 align:start position:0%
work to achieve that are you still
imagining

00:56:43.589 --> 00:56:43.599 align:start position:0%
imagining
 
00:56:47.589 --> 00:56:47.599 align:start position:0%
that average maximum award of 700 000
 
00:56:49.430 --> 00:56:49.440 align:start position:0%
with your revision
 
00:56:53.430 --> 00:56:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:55.349 --> 00:56:55.359 align:start position:0%
i think what i would say to that is that
 
00:56:57.190 --> 00:56:57.200 align:start position:0%
that's always been a very
 
00:56:57.200 --> 00:56:59.589 align:start position:0%
that's always been a very
rough

00:56:59.589 --> 00:56:59.599 align:start position:0%
rough
 
00:57:01.589 --> 00:57:01.599 align:start position:0%
calculation so
 
00:57:02.789 --> 00:57:02.799 align:start position:0%
you know when we were going through the
 
00:57:04.950 --> 00:57:04.960 align:start position:0%
legislative process
 
00:57:06.950 --> 00:57:06.960 align:start position:0%
as part of
 
00:57:08.309 --> 00:57:08.319 align:start position:0%
figuring out what the caps and the
 
00:57:10.829 --> 00:57:10.839 align:start position:0%
legislation would be we did we did the
 
00:57:14.630 --> 00:57:14.640 align:start position:0%
research to try to determine an average
 
00:57:16.150 --> 00:57:16.160 align:start position:0%
settlement award amount for similar
 
00:57:17.829 --> 00:57:17.839 align:start position:0%
claims around the country and that's
 
00:57:20.870 --> 00:57:20.880 align:start position:0%
that ended up around 700 000.
 
00:57:23.829 --> 00:57:23.839 align:start position:0%
that was just one factor in the
 
00:57:25.990 --> 00:57:26.000 align:start position:0%
in the original document we submitted to
 
00:57:28.630 --> 00:57:28.640 align:start position:0%
you is trying to stay roughly within
 
00:57:31.670 --> 00:57:31.680 align:start position:0%
that range give or take even
 
00:57:33.589 --> 00:57:33.599 align:start position:0%
a hundred thousand or maybe even a
 
00:57:34.950 --> 00:57:34.960 align:start position:0%
little more
 
00:57:34.960 --> 00:57:35.750 align:start position:0%
little more
um

00:57:35.750 --> 00:57:35.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:37.829 --> 00:57:37.839 align:start position:0%
i don't think the changes we've made
 
00:57:37.839 --> 00:57:38.549 align:start position:0%
i don't think the changes we've made
will

00:57:38.549 --> 00:57:38.559 align:start position:0%
will
 
00:57:41.589 --> 00:57:41.599 align:start position:0%
will fundamentally alter that
 
00:57:43.349 --> 00:57:43.359 align:start position:0%
but that's also again because it was
 
00:57:45.349 --> 00:57:45.359 align:start position:0%
based on some pretty rough calculations
 
00:57:47.990 --> 00:57:48.000 align:start position:0%
and based on only some information about
 
00:57:49.589 --> 00:57:49.599 align:start position:0%
some claimants
 
00:57:52.150 --> 00:57:52.160 align:start position:0%
it's certainly not not an exact
 
00:57:54.950 --> 00:57:54.960 align:start position:0%
science can i continue
 
00:57:57.270 --> 00:57:57.280 align:start position:0%
yes you may please thank you ask just go
 
00:57:59.109 --> 00:57:59.119 align:start position:0%
ahead and ask all your questions based
 
00:58:01.990 --> 00:58:02.000 align:start position:0%
on all the information you've
 
00:58:04.789 --> 00:58:04.799 align:start position:0%
reviewed internally what do you think
 
00:58:06.390 --> 00:58:06.400 align:start position:0%
the median
 
00:58:09.270 --> 00:58:09.280 align:start position:0%
award will be and what do you think
 
00:58:11.750 --> 00:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
the most frequent
 
00:58:17.510 --> 00:58:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:17.520 --> 00:58:18.870 align:start position:0%
 
it's

00:58:18.870 --> 00:58:18.880 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:58:20.710 --> 00:58:20.720 align:start position:0%
i apologize senator but i really don't
 
00:58:22.710 --> 00:58:22.720 align:start position:0%
think that's an estimate i can give you
 
00:58:25.349 --> 00:58:25.359 align:start position:0%
because even the estimates we can give
 
00:58:27.589 --> 00:58:27.599 align:start position:0%
would be based on
 
00:58:29.750 --> 00:58:29.760 align:start position:0%
just looking at
 
00:58:32.230 --> 00:58:32.240 align:start position:0%
say a spreadsheet list of numbers of
 
00:58:34.390 --> 00:58:34.400 align:start position:0%
incidents that
 
00:58:38.309 --> 00:58:38.319 align:start position:0%
that claimants might allege but
 
00:58:40.630 --> 00:58:40.640 align:start position:0%
it's really not going to be until we
 
00:58:40.640 --> 00:58:41.829 align:start position:0%
it's really not going to be until we
until

00:58:41.829 --> 00:58:41.839 align:start position:0%
until
 
00:58:43.990 --> 00:58:44.000 align:start position:0%
we have individuals who
 
00:58:45.990 --> 00:58:46.000 align:start position:0%
who tell their stories and really tell
 
00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:46.710 align:start position:0%
who tell their stories and really tell
us

00:58:46.710 --> 00:58:46.720 align:start position:0%
us
 
00:58:48.950 --> 00:58:48.960 align:start position:0%
more details about what happened to them
 
00:58:50.789 --> 00:58:50.799 align:start position:0%
and we have more details about the
 
00:58:52.710 --> 00:58:52.720 align:start position:0%
information they have surrounding what
 
00:58:53.990 --> 00:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
happened to them
 
00:58:55.349 --> 00:58:55.359 align:start position:0%
it's not going to be until we get that
 
00:58:58.069 --> 00:58:58.079 align:start position:0%
that that we could start to
 
00:59:00.549 --> 00:59:00.559 align:start position:0%
determine what what those numbers might
 
00:59:02.390 --> 00:59:02.400 align:start position:0%
look like there's there's still just a
 
00:59:04.789 --> 00:59:04.799 align:start position:0%
lot we we don't know
 
00:59:08.309 --> 00:59:08.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:10.069 --> 00:59:10.079 align:start position:0%
you know this is a opportunity to remind
 
00:59:11.670 --> 00:59:11.680 align:start position:0%
everyone of the the parallel process
 
00:59:13.030 --> 00:59:13.040 align:start position:0%
we've got going on the criminal side
 
00:59:13.990 --> 00:59:14.000 align:start position:0%
where we're doing the criminal
 
00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:15.510 align:start position:0%
where we're doing the criminal
investigation

00:59:15.510 --> 00:59:15.520 align:start position:0%
investigation
 
00:59:17.910 --> 00:59:17.920 align:start position:0%
you know we have looked deeply into
 
00:59:20.870 --> 00:59:20.880 align:start position:0%
allegations on the criminal side that
 
00:59:22.470 --> 00:59:22.480 align:start position:0%
are within the statute of limitations
 
00:59:23.910 --> 00:59:23.920 align:start position:0%
and where we think we might be able to
 
00:59:26.150 --> 00:59:26.160 align:start position:0%
bring criminal charges with many many
 
00:59:27.589 --> 00:59:27.599 align:start position:0%
people who would be outside of that
 
00:59:30.150 --> 00:59:30.160 align:start position:0%
statute of limitations and so we haven't
 
00:59:32.549 --> 00:59:32.559 align:start position:0%
we haven't conducted
 
00:59:34.549 --> 00:59:34.559 align:start position:0%
a full criminal investigation so we just
 
00:59:36.549 --> 00:59:36.559 align:start position:0%
have less details for that
 
00:59:39.430 --> 00:59:39.440 align:start position:0%
that population we also only have we
 
00:59:41.349 --> 00:59:41.359 align:start position:0%
have some details about some of the
 
00:59:43.349 --> 00:59:43.359 align:start position:0%
claimants on the civil side less details
 
00:59:45.829 --> 00:59:45.839 align:start position:0%
about others
 
00:59:47.270 --> 00:59:47.280 align:start position:0%
there's there's enough left that we
 
00:59:48.950 --> 00:59:48.960 align:start position:0%
don't know that i'm just not able to
 
00:59:50.630 --> 00:59:50.640 align:start position:0%
give you a good answer to that these are
 
00:59:52.390 --> 00:59:52.400 align:start position:0%
very what we've been able to give so far
 
00:59:53.910 --> 00:59:53.920 align:start position:0%
are very rough estimates when it comes
 
00:59:55.829 --> 00:59:55.839 align:start position:0%
to averages but when it comes to median
 
01:00:00.470 --> 01:00:00.480 align:start position:0%
and what would be the most common number
 
01:00:01.829 --> 01:00:01.839 align:start position:0%
it's just it's unfortunately not
 
01:00:03.990 --> 01:00:04.000 align:start position:0%
something i can estimate i just wonder
 
01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:05.430 align:start position:0%
something i can estimate i just wonder
because

01:00:05.430 --> 01:00:05.440 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:00:07.910 --> 01:00:07.920 align:start position:0%
we need to think how far this
 
01:00:12.789 --> 01:00:12.799 align:start position:0%
100 million dollars or 94 96 million
 
01:00:15.270 --> 01:00:15.280 align:start position:0%
is actually going to go it seems like
 
01:00:17.670 --> 01:00:17.680 align:start position:0%
your department would have
 
01:00:20.470 --> 01:00:20.480 align:start position:0%
been able to look at
 
01:00:22.150 --> 01:00:22.160 align:start position:0%
all of the
 
01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:23.510 align:start position:0%
all of the
alleged

01:00:23.510 --> 01:00:23.520 align:start position:0%
alleged
 
01:00:26.630 --> 01:00:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:30.150 --> 01:00:30.160 align:start position:0%
come up with these numbers based on
 
01:00:32.789 --> 01:00:32.799 align:start position:0%
where you think it's going to land but
 
01:00:32.799 --> 01:00:35.030 align:start position:0%
where you think it's going to land but
um

01:00:35.030 --> 01:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:36.390 --> 01:00:36.400 align:start position:0%
in another
 
01:00:38.549 --> 01:00:38.559 align:start position:0%
area i know that
 
01:00:42.630 --> 01:00:42.640 align:start position:0%
you've changed the frequency multipliers
 
01:00:46.309 --> 01:00:46.319 align:start position:0%
and it looks when i see your spreadsheet
 
01:00:46.319 --> 01:00:47.190 align:start position:0%
and it looks when i see your spreadsheet
that

01:00:47.190 --> 01:00:47.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:00:48.309 --> 01:00:48.319 align:start position:0%
it would
 
01:00:49.829 --> 01:00:49.839 align:start position:0%
take 10
 
01:00:53.510 --> 01:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
genital anal or oral rapes to hit the
 
01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:55.190 align:start position:0%
genital anal or oral rapes to hit the
cap

01:00:55.190 --> 01:00:55.200 align:start position:0%
cap
 
01:00:57.670 --> 01:00:57.680 align:start position:0%
there's a big jump between nine and ten
 
01:01:00.309 --> 01:01:00.319 align:start position:0%
rapes it's still a lot of rape
 
01:01:00.319 --> 01:01:01.589 align:start position:0%
rapes it's still a lot of rape
um

01:01:01.589 --> 01:01:01.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:03.270 --> 01:01:03.280 align:start position:0%
and under your
 
01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:04.549 align:start position:0%
and under your
new

01:01:04.549 --> 01:01:04.559 align:start position:0%
new
 
01:01:07.829 --> 01:01:07.839 align:start position:0%
duration multiplier going from 24 months
 
01:01:09.430 --> 01:01:09.440 align:start position:0%
to 12
 
01:01:12.870 --> 01:01:12.880 align:start position:0%
victims hit would hit that cap sooner
 
01:01:15.910 --> 01:01:15.920 align:start position:0%
if the rapes occur over a longer period
 
01:01:17.270 --> 01:01:17.280 align:start position:0%
of time
 
01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:18.150 align:start position:0%
of time
but

01:01:18.150 --> 01:01:18.160 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:01:21.190 --> 01:01:21.200 align:start position:0%
even going back 10 years which was
 
01:01:23.190 --> 01:01:23.200 align:start position:0%
all the information i could get out of
 
01:01:26.150 --> 01:01:26.160 align:start position:0%
the child protection division
 
01:01:28.549 --> 01:01:28.559 align:start position:0%
the average length of stay
 
01:01:31.270 --> 01:01:31.280 align:start position:0%
for committed youth was only seven
 
01:01:32.630 --> 01:01:32.640 align:start position:0%
months so
 
01:01:34.870 --> 01:01:34.880 align:start position:0%
the shortened duration
 
01:01:38.870 --> 01:01:38.880 align:start position:0%
looks good on paper but it's not likely
 
01:01:41.990 --> 01:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
to be applicable to the majority of
 
01:01:44.230 --> 01:01:44.240 align:start position:0%
claimants so
 
01:01:47.109 --> 01:01:47.119 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm really wondering and struggling
 
01:01:47.119 --> 01:01:48.069 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm really wondering and struggling
with

01:01:48.069 --> 01:01:48.079 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:01:48.079 --> 01:01:49.510 align:start position:0%
with
why

01:01:49.510 --> 01:01:49.520 align:start position:0%
why
 
01:01:51.430 --> 01:01:51.440 align:start position:0%
you would award
 
01:01:54.309 --> 01:01:54.319 align:start position:0%
more money to someone who
 
01:01:57.510 --> 01:01:57.520 align:start position:0%
had been repeatedly raped over a longer
 
01:01:59.349 --> 01:01:59.359 align:start position:0%
period of time
 
01:02:01.750 --> 01:02:01.760 align:start position:0%
than over a shorter period of time
 
01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:02.710 align:start position:0%
than over a shorter period of time
because

01:02:02.710 --> 01:02:02.720 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:02:05.190 --> 01:02:05.200 align:start position:0%
it seems counterintuitive and i'm
 
01:02:07.430 --> 01:02:07.440 align:start position:0%
wondering what the department's
 
01:02:12.470 --> 01:02:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:14.069 --> 01:02:14.079 align:start position:0%
yeah i think there's a there's a couple
 
01:02:15.190 --> 01:02:15.200 align:start position:0%
issues in there so i'm going to try to
 
01:02:17.430 --> 01:02:17.440 align:start position:0%
hit all of them and if i miss any please
 
01:02:19.109 --> 01:02:19.119 align:start position:0%
just thank you feel free to follow up
 
01:02:20.710 --> 01:02:20.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:02:22.710 --> 01:02:22.720 align:start position:0%
the the first thing i would just note on
 
01:02:27.589 --> 01:02:27.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:28.870 --> 01:02:28.880 align:start position:0%
you know you
 
01:02:30.710 --> 01:02:30.720 align:start position:0%
a claimant could end up
 
01:02:33.990 --> 01:02:34.000 align:start position:0%
hitting the cap with
 
01:02:35.750 --> 01:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
with only
 
01:02:37.190 --> 01:02:37.200 align:start position:0%
five or six
 
01:02:39.430 --> 01:02:39.440 align:start position:0%
of the of the worst incidents or even
 
01:02:41.829 --> 01:02:41.839 align:start position:0%
four or four of the worst incidents
 
01:02:44.710 --> 01:02:44.720 align:start position:0%
because they might also have additional
 
01:02:47.029 --> 01:02:47.039 align:start position:0%
incidents of um
 
01:02:50.069 --> 01:02:50.079 align:start position:0%
i i hesitate to use the word less severe
 
01:02:51.670 --> 01:02:51.680 align:start position:0%
abuse but let's just say abuse that
 
01:02:53.430 --> 01:02:53.440 align:start position:0%
falls in a different place scientific
 
01:02:55.990 --> 01:02:56.000 align:start position:0%
facts that a claimant or a victim would
 
01:02:58.069 --> 01:02:58.079 align:start position:0%
bring bring to this process so that's
 
01:03:00.230 --> 01:03:00.240 align:start position:0%
that's just the first thing i would note
 
01:03:01.670 --> 01:03:01.680 align:start position:0%
you know you certainly don't have to get
 
01:03:04.549 --> 01:03:04.559 align:start position:0%
to 10 and have a multiplier of 12 to hit
 
01:03:06.470 --> 01:03:06.480 align:start position:0%
the cap depending on what
 
01:03:07.910 --> 01:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
what incidence
 
01:03:09.670 --> 01:03:09.680 align:start position:0%
or what types of abuse
 
01:03:10.950 --> 01:03:10.960 align:start position:0%
you're alleging
 
01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:14.230 align:start position:0%
you're alleging
um

01:03:14.230 --> 01:03:14.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:15.270 align:start position:0%
 
i

01:03:15.270 --> 01:03:15.280 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:03:17.430 --> 01:03:17.440 align:start position:0%
we have some information on the average
 
01:03:19.349 --> 01:03:19.359 align:start position:0%
length of stay i think which would show
 
01:03:21.510 --> 01:03:21.520 align:start position:0%
that say prior to 10 years ago the
 
01:03:23.270 --> 01:03:23.280 align:start position:0%
average length was a lot higher than
 
01:03:26.069 --> 01:03:26.079 align:start position:0%
seven months and i might even
 
01:03:26.079 --> 01:03:27.349 align:start position:0%
seven months and i might even
ask

01:03:27.349 --> 01:03:27.359 align:start position:0%
ask
 
01:03:28.870 --> 01:03:28.880 align:start position:0%
senior assistant attorney general ramsey
 
01:03:30.230 --> 01:03:30.240 align:start position:0%
to come up to talk about that a little
 
01:03:31.349 --> 01:03:31.359 align:start position:0%
bit because i
 
01:03:33.109 --> 01:03:33.119 align:start position:0%
i do think we have we have some of that
 
01:03:34.230 --> 01:03:34.240 align:start position:0%
info so
 
01:03:36.470 --> 01:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
so i do think that that longer duration
 
01:03:38.230 --> 01:03:38.240 align:start position:0%
would come into play given that many of
 
01:03:39.910 --> 01:03:39.920 align:start position:0%
these claimants were from long enough
 
01:03:42.309 --> 01:03:42.319 align:start position:0%
ago when the average length of stay was
 
01:03:44.390 --> 01:03:44.400 align:start position:0%
longer we've seen that length of stay
 
01:03:47.750 --> 01:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
come down over time and in recent years
 
01:03:49.670 --> 01:03:49.680 align:start position:0%
especially the last 10 the average
 
01:03:50.789 --> 01:03:50.799 align:start position:0%
length is
 
01:03:53.029 --> 01:03:53.039 align:start position:0%
is a lot lower but if you start to go
 
01:03:55.430 --> 01:03:55.440 align:start position:0%
back in time you'd see that the average
 
01:03:57.750 --> 01:03:57.760 align:start position:0%
lengths of stay at ydc where we're a lot
 
01:03:57.760 --> 01:03:59.109 align:start position:0%
lengths of stay at ydc where we're a lot
longer

01:03:59.109 --> 01:03:59.119 align:start position:0%
longer
 
01:04:01.270 --> 01:04:01.280 align:start position:0%
you could share that with us because
 
01:04:04.150 --> 01:04:04.160 align:start position:0%
absolutely director ribson told me that
 
01:04:07.910 --> 01:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
his information only went back to 2011.
 
01:04:10.069 --> 01:04:10.079 align:start position:0%
yep we can absolutely share that
 
01:04:10.079 --> 01:04:10.829 align:start position:0%
yep we can absolutely share that
and

01:04:10.829 --> 01:04:10.839 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:04:10.839 --> 01:04:12.390 align:start position:0%
and
then

01:04:12.390 --> 01:04:12.400 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:13.270 align:start position:0%
then
on

01:04:13.270 --> 01:04:13.280 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:04:15.270 --> 01:04:15.280 align:start position:0%
you know a higher value for a longer
 
01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:18.309 align:start position:0%
you know a higher value for a longer
duration

01:04:18.309 --> 01:04:18.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:20.630 --> 01:04:20.640 align:start position:0%
again there's no there's no what i would
 
01:04:23.109 --> 01:04:23.119 align:start position:0%
say is a correct way to value these
 
01:04:24.870 --> 01:04:24.880 align:start position:0%
things you know we try to take into
 
01:04:27.430 --> 01:04:27.440 align:start position:0%
account the research that's available we
 
01:04:29.109 --> 01:04:29.119 align:start position:0%
take into account our discussions with
 
01:04:30.710 --> 01:04:30.720 align:start position:0%
claimants counsel
 
01:04:33.270 --> 01:04:33.280 align:start position:0%
but i think the reasoning for
 
01:04:34.870 --> 01:04:34.880 align:start position:0%
for valuing
 
01:04:36.710 --> 01:04:36.720 align:start position:0%
incidents at a higher level or at least
 
01:04:38.230 --> 01:04:38.240 align:start position:0%
having an aggravating factor if they
 
01:04:41.349 --> 01:04:41.359 align:start position:0%
occur over a longer period of time
 
01:04:44.470 --> 01:04:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:46.789 --> 01:04:46.799 align:start position:0%
there i think there's research to show
 
01:04:48.549 --> 01:04:48.559 align:start position:0%
that if
 
01:04:52.150 --> 01:04:52.160 align:start position:0%
especially a child if if if they suffer
 
01:04:53.589 --> 01:04:53.599 align:start position:0%
even if they suffer the same incidence
 
01:04:55.270 --> 01:04:55.280 align:start position:0%
of abuse if that
 
01:04:57.349 --> 01:04:57.359 align:start position:0%
occurs over a longer period of time so
 
01:04:59.270 --> 01:04:59.280 align:start position:0%
it doesn't occur say within two months
 
01:05:00.630 --> 01:05:00.640 align:start position:0%
and then it's done
 
01:05:02.309 --> 01:05:02.319 align:start position:0%
it occurs once
 
01:05:03.990 --> 01:05:04.000 align:start position:0%
and then it occurs again a couple months
 
01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:04.950 align:start position:0%
and then it occurs again a couple months
later

01:05:04.950 --> 01:05:04.960 align:start position:0%
later
 
01:05:07.430 --> 01:05:07.440 align:start position:0%
again a couple months later again a
 
01:05:09.510 --> 01:05:09.520 align:start position:0%
couple months later that that
 
01:05:12.950 --> 01:05:12.960 align:start position:0%
that often is is more harmful and causes
 
01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:15.510 align:start position:0%
that often is is more harmful and causes
um

01:05:15.510 --> 01:05:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:17.510 --> 01:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
longer lasting
 
01:05:19.510 --> 01:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
trauma or a different type and a more
 
01:05:21.750 --> 01:05:21.760 align:start position:0%
significant type of trauma again there's
 
01:05:24.710 --> 01:05:24.720 align:start position:0%
no though perfect uh there's no exact
 
01:05:27.190 --> 01:05:27.200 align:start position:0%
science to this because every person is
 
01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:28.390 align:start position:0%
science to this because every person is
different

01:05:28.390 --> 01:05:28.400 align:start position:0%
different
 
01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:29.270 align:start position:0%
different
and

01:05:29.270 --> 01:05:29.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:05:31.430 --> 01:05:31.440 align:start position:0%
every victim is impacted differently by
 
01:05:32.950 --> 01:05:32.960 align:start position:0%
the harm they suffer
 
01:05:32.960 --> 01:05:34.069 align:start position:0%
the harm they suffer
so

01:05:34.069 --> 01:05:34.079 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:05:36.309 --> 01:05:36.319 align:start position:0%
i wish i could tell you that we made
 
01:05:38.470 --> 01:05:38.480 align:start position:0%
that change and it would work perfectly
 
01:05:40.630 --> 01:05:40.640 align:start position:0%
and it perfectly fits every single
 
01:05:43.990 --> 01:05:44.000 align:start position:0%
victim i think on the whole
 
01:05:46.230 --> 01:05:46.240 align:start position:0%
it's a change that is warranted because
 
01:05:48.950 --> 01:05:48.960 align:start position:0%
on the whole if you play this out over
 
01:05:51.589 --> 01:05:51.599 align:start position:0%
over an entire population of victims
 
01:05:53.109 --> 01:05:53.119 align:start position:0%
there is research to show that the
 
01:05:55.109 --> 01:05:55.119 align:start position:0%
trauma is worse if it occurs repeatedly
 
01:05:56.950 --> 01:05:56.960 align:start position:0%
over a longer period of time
 
01:05:58.630 --> 01:05:58.640 align:start position:0%
so that that was the reasoning for that
 
01:06:01.270 --> 01:06:01.280 align:start position:0%
but i do acknowledge that
 
01:06:03.349 --> 01:06:03.359 align:start position:0%
um there's no exact science to this and
 
01:06:04.950 --> 01:06:04.960 align:start position:0%
that every
 
01:06:06.230 --> 01:06:06.240 align:start position:0%
you know it
 
01:06:08.069 --> 01:06:08.079 align:start position:0%
every victim
 
01:06:10.069 --> 01:06:10.079 align:start position:0%
the harm plays out in different ways for
 
01:06:11.750 --> 01:06:11.760 align:start position:0%
that victim and the impact is is
 
01:06:11.760 --> 01:06:12.630 align:start position:0%
that victim and the impact is is
different

01:06:12.630 --> 01:06:12.640 align:start position:0%
different
 
01:06:15.349 --> 01:06:15.359 align:start position:0%
but 12 months is the
 
01:06:15.359 --> 01:06:16.710 align:start position:0%
but 12 months is the
magic

01:06:16.710 --> 01:06:16.720 align:start position:0%
magic
 
01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:19.109 align:start position:0%
magic
line

01:06:19.109 --> 01:06:19.119 align:start position:0%
line
 
01:06:20.950 --> 01:06:20.960 align:start position:0%
i i wouldn't say it's a magic line i
 
01:06:24.069 --> 01:06:24.079 align:start position:0%
would say it's our best attempt at
 
01:06:26.630 --> 01:06:26.640 align:start position:0%
at drawing a line but i would never sit
 
01:06:27.990 --> 01:06:28.000 align:start position:0%
here and tell you i think that's that's
 
01:06:29.510 --> 01:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
a magic line
 
01:06:31.190 --> 01:06:31.200 align:start position:0%
thank you and finally
 
01:06:34.710 --> 01:06:34.720 align:start position:0%
i share representative lynn's concern
 
01:06:36.390 --> 01:06:36.400 align:start position:0%
about the
 
01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:37.190 align:start position:0%
about the
um

01:06:37.190 --> 01:06:37.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:39.190 align:start position:0%
um
this

01:06:39.190 --> 01:06:39.200 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:06:41.430 --> 01:06:41.440 align:start position:0%
process and the way it contemplates
 
01:06:41.440 --> 01:06:43.109 align:start position:0%
process and the way it contemplates
gender

01:06:43.109 --> 01:06:43.119 align:start position:0%
gender
 
01:06:45.190 --> 01:06:45.200 align:start position:0%
and anatomy
 
01:06:47.910 --> 01:06:47.920 align:start position:0%
so because
 
01:06:50.230 --> 01:06:50.240 align:start position:0%
boy's anatomy makes it
 
01:06:51.910 --> 01:06:51.920 align:start position:0%
more likely that
 
01:06:55.109 --> 01:06:55.119 align:start position:0%
the assault would be category c for
 
01:06:55.119 --> 01:06:57.029 align:start position:0%
the assault would be category c for
masturbation

01:06:57.029 --> 01:06:57.039 align:start position:0%
masturbation
 
01:06:59.589 --> 01:06:59.599 align:start position:0%
rather than um
 
01:07:04.069 --> 01:07:04.079 align:start position:0%
the anal or genital rape or oral rape
 
01:07:07.190 --> 01:07:07.200 align:start position:0%
there are so many more boys
 
01:07:11.029 --> 01:07:11.039 align:start position:0%
at the sununu center that
 
01:07:12.789 --> 01:07:12.799 align:start position:0%
the a and b
 
01:07:15.190 --> 01:07:15.200 align:start position:0%
awards for boys are
 
01:07:16.630 --> 01:07:16.640 align:start position:0%
less likely
 
01:07:18.870 --> 01:07:18.880 align:start position:0%
to occur
 
01:07:21.349 --> 01:07:21.359 align:start position:0%
and the higher awards
 
01:07:24.870 --> 01:07:24.880 align:start position:0%
for girls are less likely to occur but
 
01:07:26.309 --> 01:07:26.319 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure
 
01:07:28.789 --> 01:07:28.799 align:start position:0%
that the victims turn experience of
 
01:07:28.799 --> 01:07:30.390 align:start position:0%
that the victims turn experience of
trauma

01:07:30.390 --> 01:07:30.400 align:start position:0%
trauma
 
01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:31.990 align:start position:0%
trauma
is

01:07:31.990 --> 01:07:32.000 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:07:35.109 --> 01:07:35.119 align:start position:0%
different and matches up with
 
01:07:39.270 --> 01:07:39.280 align:start position:0%
the distinctions on monetary award and i
 
01:07:43.750 --> 01:07:43.760 align:start position:0%
wonder if you could just comment on that
 
01:07:45.670 --> 01:07:45.680 align:start position:0%
i think again the best response i can
 
01:07:47.510 --> 01:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
give to that is you know we've we've
 
01:07:49.589 --> 01:07:49.599 align:start position:0%
just arrived at these distinctions based
 
01:07:51.510 --> 01:07:51.520 align:start position:0%
on the various research that's available
 
01:07:54.069 --> 01:07:54.079 align:start position:0%
and then the conversations we've we've
 
01:07:55.430 --> 01:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
had with
 
01:07:57.109 --> 01:07:57.119 align:start position:0%
with all involved
 
01:07:58.950 --> 01:07:58.960 align:start position:0%
i think as i said to representative lin
 
01:08:00.710 --> 01:08:00.720 align:start position:0%
you know i think there's there's room
 
01:08:02.230 --> 01:08:02.240 align:start position:0%
for the administrator to take that into
 
01:08:02.240 --> 01:08:03.190 align:start position:0%
for the administrator to take that into
account

01:08:03.190 --> 01:08:03.200 align:start position:0%
account
 
01:08:05.190 --> 01:08:05.200 align:start position:0%
and there is certainly room for the
 
01:08:07.430 --> 01:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
administrator who will be
 
01:08:09.029 --> 01:08:09.039 align:start position:0%
an even more objective third party
 
01:08:10.789 --> 01:08:10.799 align:start position:0%
neutral in this process to take a look
 
01:08:11.670 --> 01:08:11.680 align:start position:0%
at that
 
01:08:13.510 --> 01:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
listen to what claimants counsel may
 
01:08:15.510 --> 01:08:15.520 align:start position:0%
have to say on that front and if the
 
01:08:17.990 --> 01:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
administrator determines that
 
01:08:19.749 --> 01:08:19.759 align:start position:0%
they should come back and request a
 
01:08:21.430 --> 01:08:21.440 align:start position:0%
change to that
 
01:08:23.189 --> 01:08:23.199 align:start position:0%
the administrator will be able to do
 
01:08:28.070 --> 01:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:31.189 --> 01:08:31.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:34.789 --> 01:08:34.799 align:start position:0%
yes senator susie thank you madam chair
 
01:08:37.510 --> 01:08:37.520 align:start position:0%
um good morning i don't apologize i'm
 
01:08:39.110 --> 01:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
sitting in for senator d'alessandro so i
 
01:08:40.870 --> 01:08:40.880 align:start position:0%
wasn't at the previous meeting although
 
01:08:41.749 --> 01:08:41.759 align:start position:0%
i did
 
01:08:44.309 --> 01:08:44.319 align:start position:0%
refer to um the handouts and and
 
01:08:46.070 --> 01:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
certainly have reviewed them but i did
 
01:08:50.470 --> 01:08:50.480 align:start position:0%
have two questions one was about um
 
01:08:52.950 --> 01:08:52.960 align:start position:0%
your characterization of trauma-informed
 
01:08:55.910 --> 01:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
and a victim-centered process
 
01:08:58.149 --> 01:08:58.159 align:start position:0%
and i wondered if in designing the
 
01:09:01.430 --> 01:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
program you had consulted anyone um
 
01:09:03.189 --> 01:09:03.199 align:start position:0%
beyond those
 
01:09:05.829 --> 01:09:05.839 align:start position:0%
advocacy groups or
 
01:09:07.990 --> 01:09:08.000 align:start position:0%
victim advocates
 
01:09:09.910 --> 01:09:09.920 align:start position:0%
that are not employed by your office
 
01:09:13.910 --> 01:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
have you gone beyond just the office
 
01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:15.189 align:start position:0%
have you gone beyond just the office
so

01:09:15.189 --> 01:09:15.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:09:17.430 --> 01:09:17.440 align:start position:0%
certainly as the legislation was going
 
01:09:19.030 --> 01:09:19.040 align:start position:0%
was going through the process we
 
01:09:21.269 --> 01:09:21.279 align:start position:0%
consulted with with a number of outside
 
01:09:24.470 --> 01:09:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:27.189 --> 01:09:27.199 align:start position:0%
the legislation contemplates
 
01:09:29.269 --> 01:09:29.279 align:start position:0%
really negotiating and discussing this
 
01:09:31.269 --> 01:09:31.279 align:start position:0%
process with claimants counsel and and
 
01:09:31.279 --> 01:09:32.229 align:start position:0%
process with claimants counsel and and
our

01:09:32.229 --> 01:09:32.239 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:09:33.990 --> 01:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
victim witness advocates within the
 
01:09:35.910 --> 01:09:35.920 align:start position:0%
department of justice
 
01:09:37.749 --> 01:09:37.759 align:start position:0%
you know i will say our our victim
 
01:09:40.630 --> 01:09:40.640 align:start position:0%
witness advocates work with with all of
 
01:09:44.229 --> 01:09:44.239 align:start position:0%
these outside groups and they do
 
01:09:45.669 --> 01:09:45.679 align:start position:0%
they do
 
01:09:48.149 --> 01:09:48.159 align:start position:0%
an enormous amount of amazing work with
 
01:09:50.309 --> 01:09:50.319 align:start position:0%
all these groups and i think they
 
01:09:52.630 --> 01:09:52.640 align:start position:0%
they're in a very good position to to
 
01:09:54.550 --> 01:09:54.560 align:start position:0%
provide feedback
 
01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:56.070 align:start position:0%
provide feedback
that

01:09:56.070 --> 01:09:56.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:09:57.669 --> 01:09:57.679 align:start position:0%
takes into account
 
01:09:59.990 --> 01:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
the feedback that many of these groups
 
01:10:03.110 --> 01:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
would provide we also um
 
01:10:05.750 --> 01:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
again looked at outside research and and
 
01:10:07.430 --> 01:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
other sources
 
01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:08.390 align:start position:0%
other sources
we

01:10:08.390 --> 01:10:08.400 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:10:09.750 --> 01:10:09.760 align:start position:0%
did not
 
01:10:12.390 --> 01:10:12.400 align:start position:0%
you know have extensive discussions with
 
01:10:15.110 --> 01:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
with uh with outside groups beyond our
 
01:10:17.030 --> 01:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
victim witness advocates again because
 
01:10:18.790 --> 01:10:18.800 align:start position:0%
they were they work with all these
 
01:10:21.030 --> 01:10:21.040 align:start position:0%
groups they're in a great position to
 
01:10:22.709 --> 01:10:22.719 align:start position:0%
to take that type of information into
 
01:10:24.550 --> 01:10:24.560 align:start position:0%
account and also because that's what was
 
01:10:27.510 --> 01:10:27.520 align:start position:0%
contemplated by the legislation
 
01:10:29.350 --> 01:10:29.360 align:start position:0%
okay and then i just have one additional
 
01:10:32.149 --> 01:10:32.159 align:start position:0%
question if i may and this one is about
 
01:10:34.149 --> 01:10:34.159 align:start position:0%
sort of the i think
 
01:10:35.910 --> 01:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
i would view as a challenge but within
 
01:10:37.910 --> 01:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
the department of justice the role of
 
01:10:39.110 --> 01:10:39.120 align:start position:0%
having to
 
01:10:41.110 --> 01:10:41.120 align:start position:0%
defend the state on the criminal side in
 
01:10:44.630 --> 01:10:44.640 align:start position:0%
these cases and then also prosecuting on
 
01:10:47.590 --> 01:10:47.600 align:start position:0%
the civil side and my question is about
 
01:10:50.310 --> 01:10:50.320 align:start position:0%
how you segregate information
 
01:10:52.470 --> 01:10:52.480 align:start position:0%
so you've gained information at this
 
01:10:54.630 --> 01:10:54.640 align:start position:0%
point i'm sure through discovery on the
 
01:10:56.830 --> 01:10:56.840 align:start position:0%
criminal side that's informed the
 
01:10:59.669 --> 01:10:59.679 align:start position:0%
process i'm wondering how you would
 
01:11:02.070 --> 01:11:02.080 align:start position:0%
protect claimant information that might
 
01:11:04.390 --> 01:11:04.400 align:start position:0%
be involved in other cases
 
01:11:07.270 --> 01:11:07.280 align:start position:0%
even if it's unrelated to this process
 
01:11:09.510 --> 01:11:09.520 align:start position:0%
and if you've contemplated going forward
 
01:11:13.270 --> 01:11:13.280 align:start position:0%
any segregation for that information of
 
01:11:15.270 --> 01:11:15.280 align:start position:0%
the claimants yeah
 
01:11:15.280 --> 01:11:16.149 align:start position:0%
the claimants yeah
so

01:11:16.149 --> 01:11:16.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:11:18.709 --> 01:11:18.719 align:start position:0%
within the department of justice we have
 
01:11:20.709 --> 01:11:20.719 align:start position:0%
very strict walls that are
 
01:11:22.790 --> 01:11:22.800 align:start position:0%
that are in place between
 
01:11:24.470 --> 01:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
the criminal side of this process and
 
01:11:26.390 --> 01:11:26.400 align:start position:0%
the civil side of this process and
 
01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:28.790 align:start position:0%
the civil side of this process and
generally

01:11:28.790 --> 01:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
generally
 
01:11:30.950 --> 01:11:30.960 align:start position:0%
obviously i as the attorney general have
 
01:11:33.430 --> 01:11:33.440 align:start position:0%
access to both and i try
 
01:11:35.270 --> 01:11:35.280 align:start position:0%
and it's just a challenge every attorney
 
01:11:36.709 --> 01:11:36.719 align:start position:0%
general has had to confront over the
 
01:11:37.990 --> 01:11:38.000 align:start position:0%
years you know i have to be very
 
01:11:39.750 --> 01:11:39.760 align:start position:0%
disciplined and do my best not to let
 
01:11:41.189 --> 01:11:41.199 align:start position:0%
that information
 
01:11:43.350 --> 01:11:43.360 align:start position:0%
cross the walls
 
01:11:44.870 --> 01:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
the determination has been made and it's
 
01:11:46.790 --> 01:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
always been the office's practice that
 
01:11:48.390 --> 01:11:48.400 align:start position:0%
ultimately the attorney general is the
 
01:11:50.390 --> 01:11:50.400 align:start position:0%
one who has to make
 
01:11:52.229 --> 01:11:52.239 align:start position:0%
the decisions at the top level and
 
01:11:54.630 --> 01:11:54.640 align:start position:0%
resolve conflicts so so they have to
 
01:11:56.950 --> 01:11:56.960 align:start position:0%
have access to both sides but but the
 
01:11:59.830 --> 01:11:59.840 align:start position:0%
information really is segregated and and
 
01:12:01.669 --> 01:12:01.679 align:start position:0%
neither side has access to the other
 
01:12:03.750 --> 01:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
side's information
 
01:12:06.870 --> 01:12:06.880 align:start position:0%
the caveat to that is that defendants in
 
01:12:08.630 --> 01:12:08.640 align:start position:0%
a criminal case have
 
01:12:10.470 --> 01:12:10.480 align:start position:0%
have of course certain rights to access
 
01:12:12.310 --> 01:12:12.320 align:start position:0%
information that may be exculpatory and
 
01:12:14.950 --> 01:12:14.960 align:start position:0%
relevant to their case so
 
01:12:17.830 --> 01:12:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:19.350 --> 01:12:19.360 align:start position:0%
i wish i could sit here and tell you
 
01:12:20.950 --> 01:12:20.960 align:start position:0%
that i know exactly how that's going to
 
01:12:23.910 --> 01:12:23.920 align:start position:0%
play out in cases where we've charged
 
01:12:26.950 --> 01:12:26.960 align:start position:0%
we've brought criminal charges
 
01:12:28.630 --> 01:12:28.640 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't know exactly what
 
01:12:30.550 --> 01:12:30.560 align:start position:0%
information may ultimately have to make
 
01:12:33.750 --> 01:12:33.760 align:start position:0%
its way into a criminal case but
 
01:12:35.910 --> 01:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
but we will certainly do everything we
 
01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:36.950 align:start position:0%
but we will certainly do everything we
can

01:12:36.950 --> 01:12:36.960 align:start position:0%
can
 
01:12:40.310 --> 01:12:40.320 align:start position:0%
to keep any sensitive information
 
01:12:40.320 --> 01:12:41.510 align:start position:0%
to keep any sensitive information
um

01:12:41.510 --> 01:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:42.630 align:start position:0%
um
that

01:12:42.630 --> 01:12:42.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:12:45.189 --> 01:12:45.199 align:start position:0%
that could cause harm to a claimant if
 
01:12:47.110 --> 01:12:47.120 align:start position:0%
it became public to keep it
 
01:12:48.709 --> 01:12:48.719 align:start position:0%
keep it private we'll do everything we
 
01:12:50.790 --> 01:12:50.800 align:start position:0%
can within the confines of a defendant's
 
01:12:52.550 --> 01:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights on the criminal
 
01:12:52.560 --> 01:12:53.830 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights on the criminal
side

01:12:53.830 --> 01:12:53.840 align:start position:0%
side
 
01:12:56.870 --> 01:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:58.709 --> 01:12:58.719 align:start position:0%
we'll have many many claimants for whom
 
01:13:00.709 --> 01:13:00.719 align:start position:0%
we cannot bring criminal charges and so
 
01:13:02.390 --> 01:13:02.400 align:start position:0%
we won't have that dynamic in which
 
01:13:04.070 --> 01:13:04.080 align:start position:0%
there's a criminal case that's relevant
 
01:13:06.149 --> 01:13:06.159 align:start position:0%
to their allegations going on at the
 
01:13:08.229 --> 01:13:08.239 align:start position:0%
same time that they might be either
 
01:13:10.630 --> 01:13:10.640 align:start position:0%
bringing a claim through this process or
 
01:13:13.430 --> 01:13:13.440 align:start position:0%
or pursuing their claims in in court but
 
01:13:15.430 --> 01:13:15.440 align:start position:0%
but the best answer i can give is that
 
01:13:16.630 --> 01:13:16.640 align:start position:0%
we have strict walls within the
 
01:13:19.110 --> 01:13:19.120 align:start position:0%
department to segregate the information
 
01:13:20.630 --> 01:13:20.640 align:start position:0%
and that while
 
01:13:21.990 --> 01:13:22.000 align:start position:0%
some of that information may have to
 
01:13:24.149 --> 01:13:24.159 align:start position:0%
cross over in a criminal case based on
 
01:13:26.470 --> 01:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
the requirements that that exculpatory
 
01:13:27.990 --> 01:13:28.000 align:start position:0%
information be provided to a criminal
 
01:13:30.149 --> 01:13:30.159 align:start position:0%
defendant we'll do everything we
 
01:13:32.630 --> 01:13:32.640 align:start position:0%
possibly can to to keep sensitive
 
01:13:34.790 --> 01:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
information private
 
01:13:36.950 --> 01:13:36.960 align:start position:0%
and could i just ask one follow-up to to
 
01:13:40.310 --> 01:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
that point um general formella
 
01:13:42.149 --> 01:13:42.159 align:start position:0%
would you see a scenario where perhaps
 
01:13:44.310 --> 01:13:44.320 align:start position:0%
the administrator once appointed and
 
01:13:47.189 --> 01:13:47.199 align:start position:0%
into their responsibilities might come
 
01:13:49.910 --> 01:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
before this committee or
 
01:13:52.229 --> 01:13:52.239 align:start position:0%
recommend additional legislation to try
 
01:13:52.239 --> 01:13:53.350 align:start position:0%
recommend additional legislation to try
to

01:13:53.350 --> 01:13:53.360 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:13:55.669 --> 01:13:55.679 align:start position:0%
further ensure privacy for claimants so
 
01:13:57.189 --> 01:13:57.199 align:start position:0%
that that line is
 
01:13:59.669 --> 01:13:59.679 align:start position:0%
a little bit brighter
 
01:14:01.510 --> 01:14:01.520 align:start position:0%
sure i could envision that especially as
 
01:14:03.510 --> 01:14:03.520 align:start position:0%
this process begins to get set up and
 
01:14:05.270 --> 01:14:05.280 align:start position:0%
implemented and the administrator gets
 
01:14:07.270 --> 01:14:07.280 align:start position:0%
their arms around it that that could be
 
01:14:08.550 --> 01:14:08.560 align:start position:0%
the type of thing the administrator
 
01:14:10.870 --> 01:14:10.880 align:start position:0%
comes back to this committee or or
 
01:14:12.149 --> 01:14:12.159 align:start position:0%
brings forward recommendations to the
 
01:14:14.709 --> 01:14:14.719 align:start position:0%
legislature on thank you
 
01:14:17.669 --> 01:14:17.679 align:start position:0%
or this committee requests his presence
 
01:14:20.149 --> 01:14:20.159 align:start position:0%
or her presence right i don't want to
 
01:14:22.630 --> 01:14:22.640 align:start position:0%
make an assumption uh representative
 
01:14:25.110 --> 01:14:25.120 align:start position:0%
edwards you had a question uh uh thank
 
01:14:27.910 --> 01:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
you madam chair and uh i'm gonna i'm
 
01:14:30.709 --> 01:14:30.719 align:start position:0%
gonna basically leap frog off of what
 
01:14:34.149 --> 01:14:34.159 align:start position:0%
senator soucy just said um and and take
 
01:14:35.990 --> 01:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
this in a little bit different direction
 
01:14:37.990 --> 01:14:38.000 align:start position:0%
uh than the rest of the questions have
 
01:14:41.750 --> 01:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
been but as i as i look at section 310
 
01:14:45.510 --> 01:14:45.520 align:start position:0%
the document 310 page six
 
01:14:47.830 --> 01:14:47.840 align:start position:0%
at the bottom of that there's a a very
 
01:14:47.840 --> 01:14:48.790 align:start position:0%
at the bottom of that there's a a very
nice

01:14:48.790 --> 01:14:48.800 align:start position:0%
nice
 
01:14:51.830 --> 01:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
concise executive summary of the legal
 
01:14:55.669 --> 01:14:55.679 align:start position:0%
notice dash privacy and confidentiality
 
01:15:00.070 --> 01:15:00.080 align:start position:0%
and i i i view this this write-up
 
01:15:02.790 --> 01:15:02.800 align:start position:0%
as being necessary but perhaps not
 
01:15:02.800 --> 01:15:03.990 align:start position:0%
as being necessary but perhaps not
sufficient

01:15:03.990 --> 01:15:04.000 align:start position:0%
sufficient
 
01:15:05.030 --> 01:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:15:07.510 --> 01:15:07.520 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm i'm curious
 
01:15:09.510 --> 01:15:09.520 align:start position:0%
particularly listening to the response
 
01:15:11.669 --> 01:15:11.679 align:start position:0%
to senator susie's questions
 
01:15:13.830 --> 01:15:13.840 align:start position:0%
about the sharing of information within
 
01:15:15.750 --> 01:15:15.760 align:start position:0%
the department
 
01:15:16.870 --> 01:15:16.880 align:start position:0%
whether or not
 
01:15:19.430 --> 01:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
there should be an explicit written
 
01:15:21.910 --> 01:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
privacy policy which is the way we did
 
01:15:23.990 --> 01:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
it in the corporate world we would write
 
01:15:26.229 --> 01:15:26.239 align:start position:0%
a privacy policy that was probably
 
01:15:28.630 --> 01:15:28.640 align:start position:0%
multiple pages in length and one of the
 
01:15:30.229 --> 01:15:30.239 align:start position:0%
things that we would touch upon in a
 
01:15:31.910 --> 01:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
privacy policy
 
01:15:34.630 --> 01:15:34.640 align:start position:0%
is um the the extent to which sharing
 
01:15:37.990 --> 01:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
would uh of the data within the company
 
01:15:41.350 --> 01:15:41.360 align:start position:0%
between third-party agencies uh could be
 
01:15:44.470 --> 01:15:44.480 align:start position:0%
done or had to be protected and stopped
 
01:15:46.709 --> 01:15:46.719 align:start position:0%
right so there's a sharing component of
 
01:15:49.510 --> 01:15:49.520 align:start position:0%
it that i think doc or doctor excuse me
 
01:15:52.709 --> 01:15:52.719 align:start position:0%
uh senator susie has touched on
 
01:15:54.870 --> 01:15:54.880 align:start position:0%
then there are two other parts
 
01:15:56.790 --> 01:15:56.800 align:start position:0%
that just jump out at me as things that
 
01:15:59.430 --> 01:15:59.440 align:start position:0%
you might find in a privacy policy
 
01:15:59.440 --> 01:16:00.630 align:start position:0%
you might find in a privacy policy
um

01:16:00.630 --> 01:16:00.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:02.550 --> 01:16:02.560 align:start position:0%
one would be
 
01:16:05.910 --> 01:16:05.920 align:start position:0%
the individual who's filed a claim
 
01:16:09.030 --> 01:16:09.040 align:start position:0%
what rights do they have to
 
01:16:11.430 --> 01:16:11.440 align:start position:0%
request the termination of their claim
 
01:16:13.510 --> 01:16:13.520 align:start position:0%
and the deletion and destruction of any
 
01:16:15.750 --> 01:16:15.760 align:start position:0%
information that they had provided to
 
01:16:18.390 --> 01:16:18.400 align:start position:0%
the state it's basically in europe it's
 
01:16:21.350 --> 01:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
referred to as the right to be forgotten
 
01:16:23.270 --> 01:16:23.280 align:start position:0%
and i'm just curious if we've
 
01:16:25.750 --> 01:16:25.760 align:start position:0%
anticipated that we might ever have a
 
01:16:29.030 --> 01:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
claimant want to just withdraw and have
 
01:16:31.030 --> 01:16:31.040 align:start position:0%
any state knowledge of what they've
 
01:16:33.750 --> 01:16:33.760 align:start position:0%
provided uh destroyed so that that's the
 
01:16:37.510 --> 01:16:37.520 align:start position:0%
second aspect and then the third um
 
01:16:41.510 --> 01:16:41.520 align:start position:0%
typically in a in a privacy policy it'll
 
01:16:43.910 --> 01:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
state specifically what a retention
 
01:16:46.709 --> 01:16:46.719 align:start position:0%
period might be um
 
01:16:48.950 --> 01:16:48.960 align:start position:0%
how long will this information be
 
01:16:50.790 --> 01:16:50.800 align:start position:0%
retained by the state
 
01:16:53.030 --> 01:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
you know 10 years after the settlement
 
01:16:55.350 --> 01:16:55.360 align:start position:0%
20 years after the settlement at some
 
01:16:58.390 --> 01:16:58.400 align:start position:0%
point we should be able to put a stake
 
01:17:00.790 --> 01:17:00.800 align:start position:0%
in the ground and say after this date
 
01:17:02.790 --> 01:17:02.800 align:start position:0%
this information this is the type of
 
01:17:04.630 --> 01:17:04.640 align:start position:0%
information that shall be destroyed now
 
01:17:07.030 --> 01:17:07.040 align:start position:0%
certainly there's probably always going
 
01:17:10.229 --> 01:17:10.239 align:start position:0%
to be some component of the information
 
01:17:12.950 --> 01:17:12.960 align:start position:0%
that needs to be retained but
 
01:17:14.310 --> 01:17:14.320 align:start position:0%
parts of it
 
01:17:16.470 --> 01:17:16.480 align:start position:0%
that can be expunged and destroyed ought
 
01:17:18.550 --> 01:17:18.560 align:start position:0%
to be as a matter of
 
01:17:21.830 --> 01:17:21.840 align:start position:0%
programmatic policy so so again i want
 
01:17:23.350 --> 01:17:23.360 align:start position:0%
to come back and i want to say this is a
 
01:17:25.590 --> 01:17:25.600 align:start position:0%
really nice executive summary of the
 
01:17:28.310 --> 01:17:28.320 align:start position:0%
privacy and confidentiality
 
01:17:31.430 --> 01:17:31.440 align:start position:0%
limits or rules of engagement
 
01:17:33.590 --> 01:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
and and i'm just curious the extent that
 
01:17:35.350 --> 01:17:35.360 align:start position:0%
there's a
 
01:17:37.750 --> 01:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
maybe a supplemental uh
 
01:17:40.149 --> 01:17:40.159 align:start position:0%
privacy policy that's uh broader and
 
01:17:51.830 --> 01:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:51.840 --> 01:17:55.830 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:17:55.830 --> 01:17:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:57.990 --> 01:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
i think to the extent that we're talking
 
01:17:59.430 --> 01:17:59.440 align:start position:0%
about you know the sharing of
 
01:18:01.590 --> 01:18:01.600 align:start position:0%
information within the department of
 
01:18:03.990 --> 01:18:04.000 align:start position:0%
justice we we have very routine just
 
01:18:07.030 --> 01:18:07.040 align:start position:0%
sort of procedures on on how we handle
 
01:18:10.630 --> 01:18:10.640 align:start position:0%
how we handle that when someone is
 
01:18:13.590 --> 01:18:13.600 align:start position:0%
okay i i just in the interest of time i
 
01:18:16.070 --> 01:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
i just want to keep the question
 
01:18:18.149 --> 01:18:18.159 align:start position:0%
simpler which is
 
01:18:21.669 --> 01:18:21.679 align:start position:0%
d do you do you see that there's a need
 
01:18:21.679 --> 01:18:22.709 align:start position:0%
d do you do you see that there's a need
for

01:18:22.709 --> 01:18:22.719 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:18:25.270 --> 01:18:25.280 align:start position:0%
another document around the privacy
 
01:18:28.149 --> 01:18:28.159 align:start position:0%
issues that are broader and deeper than
 
01:18:30.870 --> 01:18:30.880 align:start position:0%
this statement on page six it's kind of
 
01:18:33.189 --> 01:18:33.199 align:start position:0%
more of a yes or no and then there's
 
01:18:36.790 --> 01:18:36.800 align:start position:0%
plenty of time to talk details but um
 
01:18:38.470 --> 01:18:38.480 align:start position:0%
yes i think there certainly could be
 
01:18:40.149 --> 01:18:40.159 align:start position:0%
room for that i would just note without
 
01:18:42.550 --> 01:18:42.560 align:start position:0%
taking up too much time i promise that
 
01:18:44.950 --> 01:18:44.960 align:start position:0%
we we discussed this in the legislative
 
01:18:46.950 --> 01:18:46.960 align:start position:0%
process and i know there's
 
01:18:48.630 --> 01:18:48.640 align:start position:0%
there was a balance between the need to
 
01:18:51.270 --> 01:18:51.280 align:start position:0%
maintain privacy and also
 
01:18:55.110 --> 01:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
maintain generally the the access to
 
01:18:57.110 --> 01:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
to records of all of this that the
 
01:18:58.790 --> 01:18:58.800 align:start position:0%
public may have an interest in and i
 
01:19:01.350 --> 01:19:01.360 align:start position:0%
think this this is based on that balance
 
01:19:03.270 --> 01:19:03.280 align:start position:0%
we ultimately arrived at the legislation
 
01:19:07.030 --> 01:19:07.040 align:start position:0%
but but i think yes this will warrant
 
01:19:09.110 --> 01:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
further and i think continuing
 
01:19:11.270 --> 01:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
conversation as this process plays out
 
01:19:16.709 --> 01:19:16.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:20.070 --> 01:19:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:21.110 --> 01:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:19:23.350 --> 01:19:23.360 align:start position:0%
um mr attorney general
 
01:19:25.110 --> 01:19:25.120 align:start position:0%
while i was sitting here we received a
 
01:19:25.120 --> 01:19:25.990 align:start position:0%
while i was sitting here we received a
letter

01:19:25.990 --> 01:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
letter
 
01:19:28.470 --> 01:19:28.480 align:start position:0%
from commissioner hanks
 
01:19:30.550 --> 01:19:30.560 align:start position:0%
and in her letter i've been trying to
 
01:19:33.189 --> 01:19:33.199 align:start position:0%
skim it really quickly in her letter she
 
01:19:36.470 --> 01:19:36.480 align:start position:0%
brings up a couple of concerns um
 
01:19:39.750 --> 01:19:39.760 align:start position:0%
one about um that they at the
 
01:19:42.070 --> 01:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
prison they cannot use internet for
 
01:19:42.080 --> 01:19:43.510 align:start position:0%
prison they cannot use internet for
filing

01:19:43.510 --> 01:19:43.520 align:start position:0%
filing
 
01:19:46.070 --> 01:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
these claims and the other being around
 
01:19:47.669 --> 01:19:47.679 align:start position:0%
the phone system
 
01:19:51.189 --> 01:19:51.199 align:start position:0%
used by the residents at the prisons and
 
01:19:52.149 --> 01:19:52.159 align:start position:0%
that they
 
01:19:54.310 --> 01:19:54.320 align:start position:0%
would only be able to make collect
 
01:19:55.669 --> 01:19:55.679 align:start position:0%
collect calls
 
01:19:57.590 --> 01:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
and i wondered if you had
 
01:20:00.070 --> 01:20:00.080 align:start position:0%
discussed with her how you will
 
01:20:04.390 --> 01:20:04.400 align:start position:0%
proceed with those two issues
 
01:20:07.110 --> 01:20:07.120 align:start position:0%
yes so so the collect calls piece i
 
01:20:08.550 --> 01:20:08.560 align:start position:0%
think we can certainly work with the
 
01:20:10.629 --> 01:20:10.639 align:start position:0%
administrator on that to
 
01:20:12.310 --> 01:20:12.320 align:start position:0%
to um
 
01:20:13.990 --> 01:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
and charge the administrator with
 
01:20:14.950 --> 01:20:14.960 align:start position:0%
working with the department of
 
01:20:19.270 --> 01:20:19.280 align:start position:0%
corrections to to facilitate um
 
01:20:21.350 --> 01:20:21.360 align:start position:0%
facilitate a resident's ability to make
 
01:20:23.910 --> 01:20:23.920 align:start position:0%
calls to the administrator so i i think
 
01:20:25.830 --> 01:20:25.840 align:start position:0%
we certainly will we can work with both
 
01:20:26.870 --> 01:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
the administrator and the department of
 
01:20:28.550 --> 01:20:28.560 align:start position:0%
corrections on that
 
01:20:31.110 --> 01:20:31.120 align:start position:0%
on the access to the internet piece
 
01:20:32.870 --> 01:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
i i think i mentioned earlier in my
 
01:20:32.880 --> 01:20:34.229 align:start position:0%
i i think i mentioned earlier in my
remarks

01:20:34.229 --> 01:20:34.239 align:start position:0%
remarks
 
01:20:37.830 --> 01:20:37.840 align:start position:0%
you know i'm not sure there's a way to
 
01:20:40.229 --> 01:20:40.239 align:start position:0%
to alter that policy on residents not
 
01:20:42.229 --> 01:20:42.239 align:start position:0%
having access to the internet
 
01:20:42.239 --> 01:20:43.430 align:start position:0%
having access to the internet
but

01:20:43.430 --> 01:20:43.440 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:20:45.990 --> 01:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
you know we certainly are willing to and
 
01:20:47.590 --> 01:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
will you know discuss with the
 
01:20:49.110 --> 01:20:49.120 align:start position:0%
department of corrections discuss with
 
01:20:50.950 --> 01:20:50.960 align:start position:0%
the administrator once that person is
 
01:20:53.750 --> 01:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
appointed whether there's some other way
 
01:20:55.669 --> 01:20:55.679 align:start position:0%
to enable a resident to interact with
 
01:20:57.990 --> 01:20:58.000 align:start position:0%
this process electronically i don't know
 
01:21:00.070 --> 01:21:00.080 align:start position:0%
if there will be but if there is a way
 
01:21:03.110 --> 01:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
to do it that that doesn't
 
01:21:04.470 --> 01:21:04.480 align:start position:0%
raise concerns of the department of
 
01:21:06.470 --> 01:21:06.480 align:start position:0%
corrections and that is possible will
 
01:21:09.430 --> 01:21:09.440 align:start position:0%
will certainly do it so i i'm committed
 
01:21:15.110 --> 01:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:17.270 --> 01:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
thank you yes go thank you i wondered if
 
01:21:20.070 --> 01:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
um commissioner hanks has would want to
 
01:21:22.310 --> 01:21:22.320 align:start position:0%
say anything about these two areas of
 
01:21:29.910 --> 01:21:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:31.750 --> 01:21:31.760 align:start position:0%
i don't know if it's morning so maybe
 
01:21:33.189 --> 01:21:33.199 align:start position:0%
good afternoon or good morning thank you
 
01:21:35.110 --> 01:21:35.120 align:start position:0%
for that opportunity for the record uh
 
01:21:36.310 --> 01:21:36.320 align:start position:0%
helen hanks commissioner of the
 
01:21:37.910 --> 01:21:37.920 align:start position:0%
department of corrections and thank you
 
01:21:40.950 --> 01:21:40.960 align:start position:0%
for those um two specific questions the
 
01:21:43.830 --> 01:21:43.840 align:start position:0%
internet will be a challenge because of
 
01:21:45.510 --> 01:21:45.520 align:start position:0%
our requirement to meet what's called
 
01:21:47.590 --> 01:21:47.600 align:start position:0%
sieges criminal justice information
 
01:21:49.750 --> 01:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
system requirements and not allowing
 
01:21:51.910 --> 01:21:51.920 align:start position:0%
people who are incarcerated onto our
 
01:21:53.669 --> 01:21:53.679 align:start position:0%
internet we do not have a separate
 
01:21:56.790 --> 01:21:56.800 align:start position:0%
resident network and then we have
 
01:21:58.310 --> 01:21:58.320 align:start position:0%
a significant number of individuals
 
01:21:59.910 --> 01:21:59.920 align:start position:0%
incarcerated for
 
01:21:59.920 --> 01:22:01.350 align:start position:0%
incarcerated for
offenses

01:22:01.350 --> 01:22:01.360 align:start position:0%
offenses
 
01:22:04.470 --> 01:22:04.480 align:start position:0%
excuse me sexual offenses who have
 
01:22:06.470 --> 01:22:06.480 align:start position:0%
computer access prohibited as part of
 
01:22:08.830 --> 01:22:08.840 align:start position:0%
their sentencing document
 
01:22:08.840 --> 01:22:10.390 align:start position:0%
their sentencing document
um

01:22:10.390 --> 01:22:10.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:13.510 --> 01:22:13.520 align:start position:0%
we can find a path forward i'm sure i'm
 
01:22:15.830 --> 01:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
not sure it will be through the internet
 
01:22:17.750 --> 01:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
um and we do have individuals who
 
01:22:19.590 --> 01:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
obviously are filing claims on a daily
 
01:22:21.590 --> 01:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
basis and we do have notaries and we are
 
01:22:21.600 --> 01:22:22.550 align:start position:0%
basis and we do have notaries and we are
still

01:22:22.550 --> 01:22:22.560 align:start position:0%
still
 
01:22:25.189 --> 01:22:25.199 align:start position:0%
helping them process paper
 
01:22:26.950 --> 01:22:26.960 align:start position:0%
and so that is the fastest most
 
01:22:29.830 --> 01:22:29.840 align:start position:0%
efficient way but to ask
 
01:22:32.149 --> 01:22:32.159 align:start position:0%
correctional staff for example to then
 
01:22:35.669 --> 01:22:35.679 align:start position:0%
be a steward to file e-claims would put
 
01:22:37.430 --> 01:22:37.440 align:start position:0%
i think both the claimant and the
 
01:22:39.910 --> 01:22:39.920 align:start position:0%
employee in an awkward situation so i do
 
01:22:41.510 --> 01:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
think access to the internet will be a
 
01:22:43.990 --> 01:22:44.000 align:start position:0%
challenge if there was a
 
01:22:46.149 --> 01:22:46.159 align:start position:0%
hypothetical conversation around a legal
 
01:22:49.110 --> 01:22:49.120 align:start position:0%
liaison we could set up an office space
 
01:22:51.350 --> 01:22:51.360 align:start position:0%
and give that person as a steward to the
 
01:22:51.360 --> 01:22:52.550 align:start position:0%
and give that person as a steward to the
administrator

01:22:52.550 --> 01:22:52.560 align:start position:0%
administrator
 
01:22:54.629 --> 01:22:54.639 align:start position:0%
access to the internet but we want to
 
01:22:56.709 --> 01:22:56.719 align:start position:0%
make sure that the person facilitating
 
01:22:58.229 --> 01:22:58.239 align:start position:0%
internet access has control of the
 
01:23:01.350 --> 01:23:01.360 align:start position:0%
internet and is an impartial third party
 
01:23:02.790 --> 01:23:02.800 align:start position:0%
to the process
 
01:23:04.629 --> 01:23:04.639 align:start position:0%
so that's the first response i would
 
01:23:06.950 --> 01:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
make with regard to the internet
 
01:23:09.350 --> 01:23:09.360 align:start position:0%
the uh phone system
 
01:23:10.950 --> 01:23:10.960 align:start position:0%
uh been trying to come
 
01:23:13.270 --> 01:23:13.280 align:start position:0%
contemplate a solution to that because
 
01:23:14.950 --> 01:23:14.960 align:start position:0%
certainly we do not want to create an
 
01:23:16.950 --> 01:23:16.960 align:start position:0%
impediment to contacting the
 
01:23:19.270 --> 01:23:19.280 align:start position:0%
administrator um and as we allow
 
01:23:22.709 --> 01:23:22.719 align:start position:0%
individuals to have attorney calls um
 
01:23:25.270 --> 01:23:25.280 align:start position:0%
i'm working with our current vendor on
 
01:23:27.510 --> 01:23:27.520 align:start position:0%
what that might look like to create a
 
01:23:29.590 --> 01:23:29.600 align:start position:0%
here is the phone number here's a point
 
01:23:31.830 --> 01:23:31.840 align:start position:0%
to point access on the phone system that
 
01:23:34.470 --> 01:23:34.480 align:start position:0%
does not allow for a charge on either
 
01:23:34.480 --> 01:23:35.590 align:start position:0%
does not allow for a charge on either
party

01:23:35.590 --> 01:23:35.600 align:start position:0%
party
 
01:23:37.990 --> 01:23:38.000 align:start position:0%
so i i think that is the something that
 
01:23:40.149 --> 01:23:40.159 align:start position:0%
we can overcome and establish a plan
 
01:23:42.310 --> 01:23:42.320 align:start position:0%
with the goj and the administrator on
 
01:23:44.310 --> 01:23:44.320 align:start position:0%
that point so i hope that provides some
 
01:23:46.229 --> 01:23:46.239 align:start position:0%
additional information
 
01:23:47.990 --> 01:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
and certainly willing to answer any
 
01:23:51.350 --> 01:23:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:53.270 --> 01:23:53.280 align:start position:0%
senator roosevelt you have a question i
 
01:23:56.149 --> 01:23:56.159 align:start position:0%
do thank you commissioner hanks
 
01:23:58.629 --> 01:23:58.639 align:start position:0%
or general formella if you had
 
01:24:01.189 --> 01:24:01.199 align:start position:0%
discussion with the county houses of
 
01:24:01.199 --> 01:24:02.629 align:start position:0%
discussion with the county houses of
corrections

01:24:02.629 --> 01:24:02.639 align:start position:0%
corrections
 
01:24:04.550 --> 01:24:04.560 align:start position:0%
to see if they
 
01:24:08.149 --> 01:24:08.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:11.270 --> 01:24:11.280 align:start position:0%
good access to notaries and
 
01:24:14.629 --> 01:24:14.639 align:start position:0%
telephones even collect as
 
01:24:16.550 --> 01:24:16.560 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:24:16.560 --> 01:24:19.030 align:start position:0%
the state
facilities

01:24:19.030 --> 01:24:19.040 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
01:24:21.270 --> 01:24:21.280 align:start position:0%
senator roosevelt certainly i have not
 
01:24:22.950 --> 01:24:22.960 align:start position:0%
um i know some information about who
 
01:24:25.590 --> 01:24:25.600 align:start position:0%
have similar systems and who do not but
 
01:24:29.430 --> 01:24:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:31.510 --> 01:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
we have not but we could certainly do
 
01:24:31.520 --> 01:24:35.910 align:start position:0%
we have not but we could certainly do
that

01:24:35.910 --> 01:24:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:37.910 --> 01:24:37.920 align:start position:0%
thank you senator rosenwald that was one
 
01:24:39.830 --> 01:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
of my questions as well
 
01:24:39.840 --> 01:24:41.430 align:start position:0%
of my questions as well
because

01:24:41.430 --> 01:24:41.440 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:24:45.189 --> 01:24:45.199 align:start position:0%
yeah we we did not discuss at all
 
01:24:48.310 --> 01:24:48.320 align:start position:0%
the county uh correctional facilities
 
01:24:49.990 --> 01:24:50.000 align:start position:0%
and i think that
 
01:24:53.110 --> 01:24:53.120 align:start position:0%
we need to make sure that uh that that's
 
01:24:53.120 --> 01:24:54.550 align:start position:0%
we need to make sure that uh that that's
included

01:24:54.550 --> 01:24:54.560 align:start position:0%
included
 
01:24:57.430 --> 01:24:57.440 align:start position:0%
okay i do have
 
01:24:58.470 --> 01:24:58.480 align:start position:0%
two questions
 
01:25:00.470 --> 01:25:00.480 align:start position:0%
besides that one
 
01:25:03.590 --> 01:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
first of all i notice that you are
 
01:25:06.870 --> 01:25:06.880 align:start position:0%
identifying one granite place
 
01:25:09.669 --> 01:25:09.679 align:start position:0%
as the place for the
 
01:25:09.679 --> 01:25:11.590 align:start position:0%
as the place for the
administrator

01:25:11.590 --> 01:25:11.600 align:start position:0%
administrator
 
01:25:13.669 --> 01:25:13.679 align:start position:0%
are you going to be in that building by
 
01:25:17.189 --> 01:25:17.199 align:start position:0%
then or is the administrator going to
 
01:25:21.270 --> 01:25:21.280 align:start position:0%
live there all by him or herself
 
01:25:23.510 --> 01:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
well i think right now the courts are
 
01:25:26.550 --> 01:25:26.560 align:start position:0%
over there so so that yeah so i don't
 
01:25:29.189 --> 01:25:29.199 align:start position:0%
know if we'll be in there by then but
 
01:25:31.030 --> 01:25:31.040 align:start position:0%
we'll be in there eventually but given
 
01:25:32.229 --> 01:25:32.239 align:start position:0%
that the administrative office of the
 
01:25:34.310 --> 01:25:34.320 align:start position:0%
courts is over there that's why the
 
01:25:35.669 --> 01:25:35.679 align:start position:0%
administrator is going to be there
 
01:25:36.790 --> 01:25:36.800 align:start position:0%
because they're working in the judicial
 
01:25:39.590 --> 01:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
branch okay fine i just
 
01:25:41.669 --> 01:25:41.679 align:start position:0%
that was good news to me actually thank
 
01:25:41.679 --> 01:25:42.629 align:start position:0%
that was good news to me actually thank
you

01:25:42.629 --> 01:25:42.639 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:25:44.950 --> 01:25:44.960 align:start position:0%
and my other question is is that we had
 
01:25:48.149 --> 01:25:48.159 align:start position:0%
talked about um
 
01:25:51.350 --> 01:25:51.360 align:start position:0%
putting the claim form up on the web
 
01:25:53.430 --> 01:25:53.440 align:start position:0%
with a fill in the blank
 
01:25:54.629 --> 01:25:54.639 align:start position:0%
kind of thing
 
01:25:58.149 --> 01:25:58.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:59.990 --> 01:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
it will be progressing
 
01:26:03.430 --> 01:26:03.440 align:start position:0%
yes okay we've had discussions with with
 
01:26:07.030 --> 01:26:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:09.750 --> 01:26:09.760 align:start position:0%
okay so you're hoping to have that done
 
01:26:12.229 --> 01:26:12.239 align:start position:0%
by the first of december
 
01:26:14.310 --> 01:26:14.320 align:start position:0%
or before
 
01:26:16.149 --> 01:26:16.159 align:start position:0%
certainly i think january 1 is when the
 
01:26:18.149 --> 01:26:18.159 align:start position:0%
claims window opens so certainly by the
 
01:26:19.830 --> 01:26:19.840 align:start position:0%
time the claims
 
01:26:23.430 --> 01:26:23.440 align:start position:0%
window opens on january one yes okay
 
01:26:26.629 --> 01:26:26.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:26.639 --> 01:26:28.709 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:26:28.709 --> 01:26:28.719 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:26:32.070 --> 01:26:32.080 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions
 
01:26:34.830 --> 01:26:34.840 align:start position:0%
i would entertain
 
01:26:40.149 --> 01:26:40.159 align:start position:0%
emotion to approve fis 307
 
01:26:40.159 --> 01:26:41.990 align:start position:0%
emotion to approve fis 307
308

01:26:41.990 --> 01:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
308
 
01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:43.990 align:start position:0%
308
309

01:26:43.990 --> 01:26:44.000 align:start position:0%
309
 
01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:45.669 align:start position:0%
309
310

01:26:45.669 --> 01:26:45.679 align:start position:0%
310
 
01:26:48.790 --> 01:26:48.800 align:start position:0%
and add the comment that the ag
 
01:26:51.270 --> 01:26:51.280 align:start position:0%
can correct typos
 
01:26:54.229 --> 01:26:54.239 align:start position:0%
in the document without coming back to
 
01:26:57.350 --> 01:26:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:59.750 --> 01:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
thank you second
 
01:26:59.760 --> 01:27:00.629 align:start position:0%
thank you second
chair

01:27:00.629 --> 01:27:00.639 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:27:00.639 --> 01:27:02.149 align:start position:0%
chair
yes

01:27:02.149 --> 01:27:02.159 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:27:04.149 --> 01:27:04.159 align:start position:0%
to that motion about correcting the
 
01:27:07.030 --> 01:27:07.040 align:start position:0%
typos it would seem prudent that they
 
01:27:09.350 --> 01:27:09.360 align:start position:0%
should either get reviewed by
 
01:27:12.310 --> 01:27:12.320 align:start position:0%
the chair or approved by the chair
 
01:27:12.320 --> 01:27:13.350 align:start position:0%
the chair or approved by the chair
um

01:27:13.350 --> 01:27:13.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:15.510 --> 01:27:15.520 align:start position:0%
as a matter of course just so that there
 
01:27:17.990 --> 01:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
is a connection with with this committee
 
01:27:20.629 --> 01:27:20.639 align:start position:0%
i was wondering if that modification the
 
01:27:22.709 --> 01:27:22.719 align:start position:0%
motion can be made it's certainly a
 
01:27:25.510 --> 01:27:25.520 align:start position:0%
decision made between approval
 
01:27:25.520 --> 01:27:27.030 align:start position:0%
decision made between approval
or

01:27:27.030 --> 01:27:27.040 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:27:29.590 --> 01:27:29.600 align:start position:0%
notification okay i have i have no
 
01:27:30.950 --> 01:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
problem with that
 
01:27:32.870 --> 01:27:32.880 align:start position:0%
i love this document i've read it so
 
01:27:34.790 --> 01:27:34.800 align:start position:0%
many times i
 
01:27:40.390 --> 01:27:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:43.590 --> 01:27:43.600 align:start position:0%
is there any further discussion
 
01:27:45.030 --> 01:27:45.040 align:start position:0%
senator bradley
 
01:27:46.709 --> 01:27:46.719 align:start position:0%
uh thank you very much madam chair i
 
01:27:49.750 --> 01:27:49.760 align:start position:0%
think that this is a very reasonable way
 
01:27:49.760 --> 01:27:51.270 align:start position:0%
think that this is a very reasonable way
to

01:27:51.270 --> 01:27:51.280 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:27:52.870 --> 01:27:52.880 align:start position:0%
move forward
 
01:27:55.590 --> 01:27:55.600 align:start position:0%
i appreciate in particular the changes
 
01:27:58.629 --> 01:27:58.639 align:start position:0%
to the multiplier as i think that
 
01:27:58.639 --> 01:27:59.510 align:start position:0%
to the multiplier as i think that
um

01:27:59.510 --> 01:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:59.520 --> 01:28:00.550 align:start position:0%
um
really

01:28:00.550 --> 01:28:00.560 align:start position:0%
really
 
01:28:03.510 --> 01:28:03.520 align:start position:0%
solidifies the the process and the
 
01:28:06.149 --> 01:28:06.159 align:start position:0%
document i think it's also important and
 
01:28:08.790 --> 01:28:08.800 align:start position:0%
we haven't really discussed the letters
 
01:28:12.830 --> 01:28:12.840 align:start position:0%
that we've received but going back to
 
01:28:15.830 --> 01:28:15.840 align:start position:0%
when um representative umberger filed
 
01:28:17.910 --> 01:28:17.920 align:start position:0%
the legislation
 
01:28:19.990 --> 01:28:20.000 align:start position:0%
i don't think it ever was envisioned
 
01:28:22.950 --> 01:28:22.960 align:start position:0%
that this was going to work for
 
01:28:24.950 --> 01:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
absolutely everybody that there were
 
01:28:28.149 --> 01:28:28.159 align:start position:0%
still some claims that were going to um
 
01:28:31.830 --> 01:28:31.840 align:start position:0%
go forward through the court system and
 
01:28:34.310 --> 01:28:34.320 align:start position:0%
so i go back to the letters that we've
 
01:28:37.590 --> 01:28:37.600 align:start position:0%
received and i think it it bears note
 
01:28:39.590 --> 01:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
that um
 
01:28:42.950 --> 01:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
the letters talk about the fact that
 
01:28:45.270 --> 01:28:45.280 align:start position:0%
and these are from the attorneys that
 
01:28:48.229 --> 01:28:48.239 align:start position:0%
represent some of the claimants that
 
01:28:48.239 --> 01:28:49.430 align:start position:0%
represent some of the claimants that
um

01:28:49.430 --> 01:28:49.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:51.350 --> 01:28:51.360 align:start position:0%
some of the issues have been resolved by
 
01:28:53.510 --> 01:28:53.520 align:start position:0%
the process and so that's you know
 
01:28:56.310 --> 01:28:56.320 align:start position:0%
obviously to your credit and to the
 
01:28:57.830 --> 01:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
credit of
 
01:28:59.830 --> 01:28:59.840 align:start position:0%
the attorney some of whom were here
 
01:28:59.840 --> 01:29:01.350 align:start position:0%
the attorney some of whom were here
today

01:29:01.350 --> 01:29:01.360 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:29:03.910 --> 01:29:03.920 align:start position:0%
but they also talk about that it's a
 
01:29:06.550 --> 01:29:06.560 align:start position:0%
fair way and i'm going from
 
01:29:08.709 --> 01:29:08.719 align:start position:0%
tony scalimbrini's letter a fair way to
 
01:29:11.270 --> 01:29:11.280 align:start position:0%
resolve liability for many but not all
 
01:29:13.750 --> 01:29:13.760 align:start position:0%
of the children that were abused by
 
01:29:16.390 --> 01:29:16.400 align:start position:0%
the state authority that is consistent i
 
01:29:18.709 --> 01:29:18.719 align:start position:0%
think with the process that was outlined
 
01:29:20.709 --> 01:29:20.719 align:start position:0%
in the legislature and then also mr
 
01:29:22.229 --> 01:29:22.239 align:start position:0%
rainbow's letter
 
01:29:22.239 --> 01:29:23.270 align:start position:0%
rainbow's letter
um

01:29:23.270 --> 01:29:23.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:26.229 --> 01:29:26.239 align:start position:0%
says something very similar we strongly
 
01:29:28.950 --> 01:29:28.960 align:start position:0%
believe that if the administered
 
01:29:31.830 --> 01:29:31.840 align:start position:0%
is efficiently and equitably a large
 
01:29:31.840 --> 01:29:33.110 align:start position:0%
is efficiently and equitably a large
majority

01:29:33.110 --> 01:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
majority
 
01:29:35.430 --> 01:29:35.440 align:start position:0%
of the claimants will strongly favor the
 
01:29:38.470 --> 01:29:38.480 align:start position:0%
program for two main factors time
 
01:29:40.870 --> 01:29:40.880 align:start position:0%
and process so i think
 
01:29:40.880 --> 01:29:42.709 align:start position:0%
and process so i think
while

01:29:42.709 --> 01:29:42.719 align:start position:0%
while
 
01:29:45.750 --> 01:29:45.760 align:start position:0%
no legislation this included is ever
 
01:29:47.669 --> 01:29:47.679 align:start position:0%
perfect for everybody
 
01:29:50.310 --> 01:29:50.320 align:start position:0%
it's it's a very reasonable way of
 
01:29:52.470 --> 01:29:52.480 align:start position:0%
proceeding i think it's also important
 
01:29:54.470 --> 01:29:54.480 align:start position:0%
that we've heard
 
01:29:54.480 --> 01:29:55.270 align:start position:0%
that we've heard
from

01:29:55.270 --> 01:29:55.280 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:29:57.510 --> 01:29:57.520 align:start position:0%
not only yourself but
 
01:29:59.350 --> 01:29:59.360 align:start position:0%
in the conversations that you've had
 
01:30:01.669 --> 01:30:01.679 align:start position:0%
with some of the claimant attorneys a
 
01:30:04.149 --> 01:30:04.159 align:start position:0%
process for choosing the administrator
 
01:30:05.430 --> 01:30:05.440 align:start position:0%
that's going to be
 
01:30:07.270 --> 01:30:07.280 align:start position:0%
very important and i think the
 
01:30:07.280 --> 01:30:09.430 align:start position:0%
very important and i think the
commitment

01:30:09.430 --> 01:30:09.440 align:start position:0%
commitment
 
01:30:11.110 --> 01:30:11.120 align:start position:0%
that's been made today that the
 
01:30:11.120 --> 01:30:12.550 align:start position:0%
that's been made today that the
administrator

01:30:12.550 --> 01:30:12.560 align:start position:0%
administrator
 
01:30:15.510 --> 01:30:15.520 align:start position:0%
can come forward either to the fiscal
 
01:30:17.189 --> 01:30:17.199 align:start position:0%
committee or potential even the full
 
01:30:17.199 --> 01:30:18.629 align:start position:0%
committee or potential even the full
legislature

01:30:18.629 --> 01:30:18.639 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
01:30:22.310 --> 01:30:22.320 align:start position:0%
um with possible changes based on you
 
01:30:24.950 --> 01:30:24.960 align:start position:0%
know what happens i think is also
 
01:30:27.990 --> 01:30:28.000 align:start position:0%
effective so i think you know
 
01:30:30.310 --> 01:30:30.320 align:start position:0%
you've done a really good job i think
 
01:30:31.590 --> 01:30:31.600 align:start position:0%
you know i want to
 
01:30:35.030 --> 01:30:35.040 align:start position:0%
give a shout out to tony scalimbrini and
 
01:30:36.629 --> 01:30:36.639 align:start position:0%
a couple of the other attorneys that
 
01:30:38.709 --> 01:30:38.719 align:start position:0%
worked long and hard with your office
 
01:30:40.709 --> 01:30:40.719 align:start position:0%
with miss ramsey
 
01:30:42.470 --> 01:30:42.480 align:start position:0%
so i think it's a reasonable way to
 
01:30:45.910 --> 01:30:45.920 align:start position:0%
proceed and hopefully bring closure for
 
01:30:49.510 --> 01:30:49.520 align:start position:0%
a number of people that
 
01:30:51.590 --> 01:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
just having to rely on the court system
 
01:30:54.790 --> 01:30:54.800 align:start position:0%
is is not going to work for them because
 
01:30:56.950 --> 01:30:56.960 align:start position:0%
of what was outlined in terms of time
 
01:30:59.030 --> 01:30:59.040 align:start position:0%
and process so
 
01:31:01.750 --> 01:31:01.760 align:start position:0%
i am pleased to second center daniel's
 
01:31:01.760 --> 01:31:04.390 align:start position:0%
i am pleased to second center daniel's
motion

01:31:04.390 --> 01:31:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:04.400 --> 01:31:05.350 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:31:05.350 --> 01:31:05.360 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:31:07.590 --> 01:31:07.600 align:start position:0%
i think you have to third it
 
01:31:07.600 --> 01:31:08.629 align:start position:0%
i think you have to third it
because

01:31:08.629 --> 01:31:08.639 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:31:10.870 --> 01:31:10.880 align:start position:0%
okay representative lynn
 
01:31:12.310 --> 01:31:12.320 align:start position:0%
i think
 
01:31:14.709 --> 01:31:14.719 align:start position:0%
i heard that in my ear but that's okay
 
01:31:18.709 --> 01:31:18.719 align:start position:0%
okay are there any further discussion
 
01:31:23.350 --> 01:31:23.360 align:start position:0%

i would i would like to just say that um

i know and i think we all know that uh
 
01:32:21.590 --> 01:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
if we had
 
01:32:23.270 --> 01:32:23.280 align:start position:0%
a million years
 
01:32:25.669 --> 01:32:25.679 align:start position:0%
to try to get this process absolutely
 
01:32:25.679 --> 01:32:26.629 align:start position:0%
to try to get this process absolutely
perfect

01:32:26.629 --> 01:32:26.639 align:start position:0%
perfect
 
01:32:28.709 --> 01:32:28.719 align:start position:0%
we might make it
 
01:32:32.950 --> 01:32:32.960 align:start position:0%
uh we've had roughly three months
 
01:32:35.910 --> 01:32:35.920 align:start position:0%
and i do want to stress
 
01:32:35.920 --> 01:32:37.030 align:start position:0%
and i do want to stress
that

01:32:37.030 --> 01:32:37.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:32:40.229 --> 01:32:40.239 align:start position:0%
the person that is appointed as
 
01:32:40.239 --> 01:32:41.990 align:start position:0%
the person that is appointed as
administrator

01:32:41.990 --> 01:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
administrator
 
01:32:44.470 --> 01:32:44.480 align:start position:0%
we'll re-look at this
 
01:32:46.870 --> 01:32:46.880 align:start position:0%
see if there are things that he or she
 
01:32:49.750 --> 01:32:49.760 align:start position:0%
thinks need to be adjusted
 
01:32:49.760 --> 01:32:51.830 align:start position:0%
thinks need to be adjusted
and

01:32:51.830 --> 01:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:32:52.950 --> 01:32:52.960 align:start position:0%
and we're
 
01:32:56.229 --> 01:32:56.239 align:start position:0%
open at any time on the fiscal committee
 
01:32:59.430 --> 01:32:59.440 align:start position:0%
for the administrator to return
 
01:33:02.310 --> 01:33:02.320 align:start position:0%

another step forward
 
01:33:48.070 --> 01:33:48.080 align:start position:0%
without spending
 
01:33:51.030 --> 01:33:51.040 align:start position:0%
time and money trying to go through
 
01:33:52.870 --> 01:33:52.880 align:start position:0%
uh the court
 
01:33:54.709 --> 01:33:54.719 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:33:57.590 --> 01:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
as i think we all understand
 
01:33:57.600 --> 01:33:58.550 align:start position:0%
as i think we all understand
if

01:33:58.550 --> 01:33:58.560 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:34:00.950 --> 01:34:00.960 align:start position:0%
the people go through the court
 
01:34:02.709 --> 01:34:02.719 align:start position:0%
we're looking at
 
01:34:04.870 --> 01:34:04.880 align:start position:0%
probably years and years
 
01:34:07.910 --> 01:34:07.920 align:start position:0%
before that process can be completed
 
01:34:10.149 --> 01:34:10.159 align:start position:0%
but for those that
 
01:34:13.669 --> 01:34:13.679 align:start position:0%
feel very strongly that this process the
 
01:34:16.149 --> 01:34:16.159 align:start position:0%
this alternative process is not going to
 
01:34:19.189 --> 01:34:19.199 align:start position:0%
work for them then yes they should in
 
01:34:21.110 --> 01:34:21.120 align:start position:0%
fact go to court
 
01:34:25.350 --> 01:34:25.360 align:start position:0%
