00:08:09.749 --> 00:08:09.759 align:start position:0%
and also hb607 which is our second
 
00:08:11.589 --> 00:08:11.599 align:start position:0%
education savings account
 
00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation
 
00:08:15.189 --> 00:08:15.199 align:start position:0%
so starting out
 
00:08:19.029 --> 00:08:19.039 align:start position:0%
we're going to start with hb613
 
00:08:21.029 --> 00:08:21.039 align:start position:0%
i'm going to
 
00:08:23.749 --> 00:08:23.759 align:start position:0%
do what i did the other day
 
00:08:25.589 --> 00:08:25.599 align:start position:0%
i'm going to open this up to discussion
 
00:08:27.589 --> 00:08:27.599 align:start position:0%
during this discussion period i will
 
00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:29.440 align:start position:0%
absolutely take no
 
00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:32.640 align:start position:0%
no uh motions for either
 
00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:36.560 align:start position:0%
otp itl anything else retain etc
 
00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:38.240 align:start position:0%
there are some issues i think which we
 
00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
all need become more familiar with in
 
00:08:41.589 --> 00:08:41.599 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
and that is the amending language for
 
00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
the special education aid and for those
 
00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:48.240 align:start position:0%
that are used to it this is used to be
 
00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:50.480 align:start position:0%
called catastrophic aid
 
00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:51.920 align:start position:0%
and it's
 
00:08:55.269 --> 00:08:55.279 align:start position:0%
just a huge huge expense for local
 
00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
school districts
 
00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:57.829 align:start position:0%
school districts
and

00:08:57.829 --> 00:08:57.839 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:01.040 align:start position:0%
i'm hoping that today we can discuss
 
00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:03.360 align:start position:0%
uh the amendment which is being put
 
00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:04.640 align:start position:0%
forth by
 
00:09:07.509 --> 00:09:07.519 align:start position:0%
i will put for it forth but uh the
 
00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:10.320 align:start position:0%
really the the people behind this have
 
00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:12.240 align:start position:0%
been representative hill
 
00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:14.800 align:start position:0%
and actuary support
 
00:09:17.509 --> 00:09:17.519 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out a way that we can
 
00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:20.160 align:start position:0%
avoid this really awful mess we're in in
 
00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:22.880 align:start position:0%
terms of taking a huge part of the
 
00:09:25.509 --> 00:09:25.519 align:start position:0%
catastrophic costs from
 
00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:28.800 align:start position:0%
our operating costs uh the the state
 
00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:32.000 align:start position:0%
coughs up uh very little of that and so
 
00:09:34.389 --> 00:09:34.399 align:start position:0%
does the feds the the 40 we're supposed
 
00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:36.880 align:start position:0%
to receive we've never received that in
 
00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:39.760 align:start position:0%
the life of of that legislation
 
00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
so i'd like to get on with this
 
00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:44.160 align:start position:0%
and with the
 
00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:46.320 align:start position:0%

as far as i know both
experts

00:11:10.389 --> 00:11:10.399 align:start position:0%
experts
 
00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:12.640 align:start position:0%

technical questions which i can't answer
 
00:11:23.829 --> 00:11:23.839 align:start position:0%
um these are both actuaries firms one is
 
00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:25.760 align:start position:0%
the department of insurance
 
00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:28.160 align:start position:0%
and they did the preliminary actuary
 
00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:28.949 align:start position:0%
and they did the preliminary actuary
work

00:11:28.949 --> 00:11:28.959 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:31.120 align:start position:0%
and then we went for an rfp
 
00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:34.000 align:start position:0%
um by this kansas firm
 
00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:34.949 align:start position:0%
um by this kansas firm
called

00:11:34.949 --> 00:11:34.959 align:start position:0%
called
 
00:11:37.269 --> 00:11:37.279 align:start position:0%
lewis and ellis and the vice president
 
00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:39.680 align:start position:0%
of lewis and ellis is on the line as
 
00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:40.630 align:start position:0%
of lewis and ellis is on the line as
well

00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:40.640 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:11:42.389 --> 00:11:42.399 align:start position:0%
so perhaps it might be wise than
 
00:11:43.829 --> 00:11:43.839 align:start position:0%
representative that that you give a
 
00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:45.680 align:start position:0%
brief overview of the bill first the
 
00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:46.790 align:start position:0%
brief overview of the bill first the
amendment

00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:50.160 align:start position:0%
so that uh folks understand some of the
 
00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:53.200 align:start position:0%
the language and and terms within it
 
00:11:56.630 --> 00:11:56.640 align:start position:0%
and then we can get into questions or
 
00:11:58.870 --> 00:11:58.880 align:start position:0%
for for our technical support as we've
 
00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:02.160 align:start position:0%
done previously in many bills
 
00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
uh happy to do that um
 
00:12:07.269 --> 00:12:07.279 align:start position:0%
i will tell you that uh while this may
 
00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:10.320 align:start position:0%
seem like a last-minute
 
00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:14.000 align:start position:0%
bill uh this concept is years old um i
 
00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:16.480 align:start position:0%
actually started working on this policy
 
00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:17.590 align:start position:0%
actually started working on this policy
idea

00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:17.600 align:start position:0%
idea
 
00:12:20.389 --> 00:12:20.399 align:start position:0%
uh when chairman lad and i were sitting
 
00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
on the education committee back in 2012.
 
00:12:26.389 --> 00:12:26.399 align:start position:0%
just in the last two years it's been
 
00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:28.720 align:start position:0%
revitalized with
 
00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
with commissioner edelblut and
 
00:12:33.269 --> 00:12:33.279 align:start position:0%
and we brought the concept to the new
 
00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:35.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire department of insurance two
 
00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:36.720 align:start position:0%
summers ago
 
00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:40.160 align:start position:0%
um commissioner edelblut brought in the
 
00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:41.110 align:start position:0%
um commissioner edelblut brought in the
uh

00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:41.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:41.829 align:start position:0%
uh
the

00:12:41.829 --> 00:12:41.839 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:43.680 align:start position:0%
insurance commissioner
 
00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
and uh and we were introduced to the
 
00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:48.880 align:start position:0%
actuary from the insurance department
 
00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:51.760 align:start position:0%

they did very fine work and uh
 
00:12:56.710 --> 00:12:56.720 align:start position:0%
and that led us to at the department of
 
00:13:00.069 --> 00:13:00.079 align:start position:0%
education request a national nationwide
 
00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
rfp for an actuary firm
 
00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:05.600 align:start position:0%
to provide an analysis
 
00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire's special ed claims
 
00:13:10.949 --> 00:13:10.959 align:start position:0%
data and create tools to predict future
 
00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:14.240 align:start position:0%
costs by each district
 
00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:15.920 align:start position:0%
the vice president of the winning
 
00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:18.560 align:start position:0%
actuary firm lewis and ellis is also on
 
00:13:20.949 --> 00:13:20.959 align:start position:0%
the call today from her location in
 
00:13:20.959 --> 00:13:23.990 align:start position:0%
the call today from her location in
kansas

00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:26.560 align:start position:0%
i want to just let you know that in new
 
00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:29.440 align:start position:0%
hampshire it's a well-known as chairman
 
00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:31.360 align:start position:0%
lad just outlined
 
00:13:33.190 --> 00:13:33.200 align:start position:0%
that school district budget committees
 
00:13:35.590 --> 00:13:35.600 align:start position:0%
school boards and superintendents fear
 
00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:37.600 align:start position:0%
unexpected high
 
00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
special ed expenses arriving after
 
00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:42.560 align:start position:0%
school budgets have been voted on and
 
00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:43.750 align:start position:0%
school budgets have been voted on and
fixed

00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
fixed
 
00:13:46.069 --> 00:13:46.079 align:start position:0%
the volatility of special ed costs
 
00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:48.160 align:start position:0%
especially in smaller districts is a
 
00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:50.240 align:start position:0%
huge concern
 
00:13:52.629 --> 00:13:52.639 align:start position:0%
the data analysis done by our department
 
00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
of insurance pointed out something
 
00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:55.670 align:start position:0%
of insurance pointed out something
interesting

00:13:55.670 --> 00:13:55.680 align:start position:0%
interesting
 
00:13:57.829 --> 00:13:57.839 align:start position:0%
while districts can see important and
 
00:14:00.389 --> 00:14:00.399 align:start position:0%
measurable volatility statewide the
 
00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
special education costs remain fairly
 
00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:04.790 align:start position:0%
special education costs remain fairly
predictable

00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:04.800 align:start position:0%
predictable
 
00:14:06.389 --> 00:14:06.399 align:start position:0%
all districts are aware of these
 
00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:08.480 align:start position:0%
negative effects to a budget
 
00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:11.360 align:start position:0%
and that's why 117 districts in new
 
00:14:14.389 --> 00:14:14.399 align:start position:0%
hampshire currently have what some call
 
00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:18.320 align:start position:0%
rainy day funds or non-lapsing capital
 
00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:19.760 align:start position:0%
reserve funds
 
00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:22.720 align:start position:0%
to self-insure against unexpected
 
00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:24.880 align:start position:0%
special ed expenses
 
00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:26.320 align:start position:0%
these accounts
 
00:14:29.829 --> 00:14:29.839 align:start position:0%
statewide total about 6 million dollars
 
00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:33.680 align:start position:0%
that averages 50 000 per district but in
 
00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:35.920 align:start position:0%
reality the size of the accounts vary
 
00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:37.829 align:start position:0%
reality the size of the accounts vary
enormously

00:14:37.829 --> 00:14:37.839 align:start position:0%
enormously
 
00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:40.160 align:start position:0%
up until now self-insuring has been the
 
00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:42.720 align:start position:0%
single best way of handling the option
 
00:14:44.629 --> 00:14:44.639 align:start position:0%
but some districts have rejected this
 
00:14:44.639 --> 00:14:46.949 align:start position:0%
but some districts have rejected this
option

00:14:46.949 --> 00:14:46.959 align:start position:0%
option
 
00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:48.560 align:start position:0%
the amendment you have in front of you
 
00:14:50.629 --> 00:14:50.639 align:start position:0%
simply enables school districts
 
00:14:50.639 --> 00:14:51.990 align:start position:0%
simply enables school districts
themselves

00:14:51.990 --> 00:14:52.000 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
00:14:54.790 --> 00:14:54.800 align:start position:0%
to create and join risk pool
 
00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:56.550 align:start position:0%
to create and join risk pool
associations

00:14:56.550 --> 00:14:56.560 align:start position:0%
associations
 
00:14:58.629 --> 00:14:58.639 align:start position:0%
which we believe will create a solution
 
00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:01.120 align:start position:0%
to their fears and concerns of budget
 
00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:04.240 align:start position:0%
busting non-reimbursed special ed costs
 
00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:06.560 align:start position:0%
and much of the volatility
 
00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
by creating a single budgetable expense
 
00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:12.160 align:start position:0%
and for those districts who are
 
00:15:13.990 --> 00:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
attempting to self-insure
 
00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:15.920 align:start position:0%
we believe a collective risk pool is a
 
00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:18.160 align:start position:0%
much better solution
 
00:15:19.590 --> 00:15:19.600 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire through the
 
00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:22.160 align:start position:0%
secretary of state currently authorizes
 
00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:25.600 align:start position:0%
the use of what we what are called 5b
 
00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:27.920 align:start position:0%
risk pools
 
00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:30.560 align:start position:0%
5b because that is the rsa that covers
 
00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:32.480 align:start position:0%
these instruments
 
00:15:34.389 --> 00:15:34.399 align:start position:0%
currently reimbursing special ed
 
00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
expenses is not a listed and approved
 
00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
use of risk pools
 
00:15:41.509 --> 00:15:41.519 align:start position:0%
in that rsa
 
00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
this amendment first fixes that
 
00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
municipal risk pools are a
 
00:15:48.629 --> 00:15:48.639 align:start position:0%
well-recognized tool throughout the
 
00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:51.440 align:start position:0%
united states i actually spoke with the
 
00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:53.360 align:start position:0%
executive director for the national
 
00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:54.790 align:start position:0%
executive director for the national
association

00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:54.800 align:start position:0%
association
 
00:15:57.590 --> 00:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
of municipal risk pools about her
 
00:15:59.910 --> 00:15:59.920 align:start position:0%
membership and while she knew of no risk
 
00:16:01.269 --> 00:16:01.279 align:start position:0%
pools designed
 
00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:03.040 align:start position:0%
for special ed costs she could only
 
00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:05.920 align:start position:0%
confirm that none of her members of her
 
00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:07.430 align:start position:0%
confirm that none of her members of her
organization

00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
organization
 
00:16:09.829 --> 00:16:09.839 align:start position:0%
utilize these tools
 
00:16:11.829 --> 00:16:11.839 align:start position:0%
most of her members are health insurance
 
00:16:14.389 --> 00:16:14.399 align:start position:0%
related and in fact the three municipal
 
00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
risk schools currently in new hampshire
 
00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:20.240 align:start position:0%
are also health insurance related
 
00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
this amendment allows school district
 
00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:24.880 align:start position:0%
superintendents to form a special
 
00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:28.320 align:start position:0%
education risk pool association with as
 
00:16:30.310 --> 00:16:30.320 align:start position:0%
few as five district
 
00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:31.829 align:start position:0%
few as five district
members

00:16:31.829 --> 00:16:31.839 align:start position:0%
members
 
00:16:33.269 --> 00:16:33.279 align:start position:0%
the associations will be
 
00:16:33.279 --> 00:16:34.949 align:start position:0%
the associations will be
self-administered

00:16:34.949 --> 00:16:34.959 align:start position:0%
self-administered
 
00:16:37.189 --> 00:16:37.199 align:start position:0%
the associations will have access to the
 
00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
tools to predict costs and premiums
 
00:16:43.189 --> 00:16:43.199 align:start position:0%
the associations will choose whether to
 
00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
self-insure or apply for third-party
 
00:16:49.269 --> 00:16:49.279 align:start position:0%
insurance or a combination of both
 
00:16:51.749 --> 00:16:51.759 align:start position:0%
the associations can decide whether to
 
00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:54.160 align:start position:0%
reimburse at one hundred percent or
 
00:16:56.470 --> 00:16:56.480 align:start position:0%
eighty percent or any percentage they
 
00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:58.069 align:start position:0%
eighty percent or any percentage they
choose

00:16:58.069 --> 00:16:58.079 align:start position:0%
choose
 
00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:00.480 align:start position:0%
the associations for the most part
 
00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
will control the rules they want by the
 
00:17:05.350 --> 00:17:05.360 align:start position:0%
way their organizational documents are
 
00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:07.510 align:start position:0%
way their organizational documents are
drafted

00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:07.520 align:start position:0%
drafted
 
00:17:09.909 --> 00:17:09.919 align:start position:0%
the department of education for their
 
00:17:12.309 --> 00:17:12.319 align:start position:0%
part continues to operate in the
 
00:17:14.949 --> 00:17:14.959 align:start position:0%
adjudication of special ed claims
 
00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:16.880 align:start position:0%
the department by this amendment will
 
00:17:20.309 --> 00:17:20.319 align:start position:0%
have one additional responsibility
 
00:17:22.309 --> 00:17:22.319 align:start position:0%
which is because of their duty to
 
00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:25.280 align:start position:0%
maintain student privacy protections
 
00:17:28.549 --> 00:17:28.559 align:start position:0%
and so they are required to issue rfps
 
00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:31.840 align:start position:0%
for firms to update the claims data
 
00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:34.720 align:start position:0%
that assures the cost predictor tools
 
00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:37.360 align:start position:0%
can most accurate can provide most
 
00:17:39.669 --> 00:17:39.679 align:start position:0%
accurate predictions of future premiums
 
00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
for the school districts
 
00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:44.240 align:start position:0%
with that i think i'll end my testimony
 
00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:47.200 align:start position:0%
and offer to answer questions
 
00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
i'm especially hopeful that you'll find
 
00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:50.480 align:start position:0%
that superintendents will appreciate
 
00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:53.120 align:start position:0%
this new option to help them create a
 
00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:54.230 align:start position:0%
this new option to help them create a
budgetable

00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:54.240 align:start position:0%
budgetable
 
00:17:56.950 --> 00:17:56.960 align:start position:0%
insurance against budget busting
 
00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
surprise without the need to build their
 
00:18:03.669 --> 00:18:03.679 align:start position:0%
own single entity risk pools
 
00:18:04.630 --> 00:18:04.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:06.400 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh represent hill i
 
00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:09.440 align:start position:0%
do have one question for you um
 
00:18:11.669 --> 00:18:11.679 align:start position:0%
the premium costs that the individual
 
00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:12.880 align:start position:0%
districts within one of these
 
00:18:14.710 --> 00:18:14.720 align:start position:0%
associations would be paying you've
 
00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:17.200 align:start position:0%
indicated can it be determined by that
 
00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:19.200 align:start position:0%
particular association
 
00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:21.760 align:start position:0%
eighty percent forty percent 100 percent
 
00:18:23.909 --> 00:18:23.919 align:start position:0%
uh coverage
 
00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:27.360 align:start position:0%
have you done any um calculations or as
 
00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
the insurance uh department
 
00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:30.630 align:start position:0%
the insurance uh department
or

00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:30.640 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:34.160 align:start position:0%
any actuary uh firm here that has
 
00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:36.640 align:start position:0%
identified what the actual premium cost
 
00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:40.320 align:start position:0%
might be for a a a small a middle or
 
00:18:42.789 --> 00:18:42.799 align:start position:0%
large school district
 
00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:44.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question mr chairman
 
00:18:47.190 --> 00:18:47.200 align:start position:0%
um so the answer
 
00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:50.160 align:start position:0%
is it depends um unfortunately it
 
00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:52.400 align:start position:0%
depends on who the membership of that
 
00:18:54.390 --> 00:18:54.400 align:start position:0%
organization would be
 
00:18:56.150 --> 00:18:56.160 align:start position:0%
each of the
 
00:19:00.789 --> 00:19:00.799 align:start position:0%
each district is uh rated on their
 
00:19:00.799 --> 00:19:02.070 align:start position:0%
each district is uh rated on their
experience

00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:02.080 align:start position:0%
experience
 
00:19:04.549 --> 00:19:04.559 align:start position:0%
so they would um
 
00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:06.960 align:start position:0%
there is a tool and that was the purpose
 
00:19:08.549 --> 00:19:08.559 align:start position:0%
of the rfp
 
00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
for the actuary firm in kansas to create
 
00:19:14.950 --> 00:19:14.960 align:start position:0%
a tool to predict the the annual cost
 
00:19:16.870 --> 00:19:16.880 align:start position:0%
for this coming year
 
00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:19.840 align:start position:0%
and and so it depends on who the members
 
00:19:23.669 --> 00:19:23.679 align:start position:0%
of our are of the association
 
00:19:26.150 --> 00:19:26.160 align:start position:0%
the cost would be for each individual
 
00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:27.669 align:start position:0%
the cost would be for each individual
district

00:19:27.669 --> 00:19:27.679 align:start position:0%
district
 
00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
and i think probably um that can be
 
00:19:32.549 --> 00:19:32.559 align:start position:0%
better explained i know it can
 
00:19:34.230 --> 00:19:34.240 align:start position:0%
by the actuary
 
00:19:36.549 --> 00:19:36.559 align:start position:0%
we have in our possession now at the
 
00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:39.440 align:start position:0%
department of education a cost predictor
 
00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:40.630 align:start position:0%
department of education a cost predictor
tool

00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:40.640 align:start position:0%
tool
 
00:19:43.029 --> 00:19:43.039 align:start position:0%
that took the claims i think it went
 
00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
back to 2014
 
00:19:46.549 --> 00:19:46.559 align:start position:0%
took the claims for each of the
 
00:19:46.559 --> 00:19:47.590 align:start position:0%
took the claims for each of the
districts

00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:47.600 align:start position:0%
districts
 
00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
and was able to create a predictor tool
 
00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:54.080 align:start position:0%
there's three different models within
 
00:19:56.230 --> 00:19:56.240 align:start position:0%
this tool i'm told
 
00:19:58.950 --> 00:19:58.960 align:start position:0%
and two of the tools
 
00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
would allow all special ed costs
 
00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
and the third tool
 
00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
would indicate just the cat aid
 
00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:08.390 align:start position:0%
would indicate just the cat aid
risk

00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
risk
 
00:20:09.909 --> 00:20:09.919 align:start position:0%
for the future
 
00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:13.600 align:start position:0%
so it is um it is in this we have the
 
00:20:16.150 --> 00:20:16.160 align:start position:0%
tool available now i guess is the answer
 
00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:18.640 align:start position:0%
the short answer to your question and
 
00:20:21.669 --> 00:20:21.679 align:start position:0%
and um so it would depend on which
 
00:20:24.549 --> 00:20:24.559 align:start position:0%
community we're talking about
 
00:20:27.669 --> 00:20:27.679 align:start position:0%
thank you are there questions from uh
 
00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:29.120 align:start position:0%
represent milor
 
00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:32.000 align:start position:0%
uh thank you uh thank you mr chairman
 
00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:33.360 align:start position:0%
uh the question i have for
 
00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:34.720 align:start position:0%
representative hill
 
00:20:37.669 --> 00:20:37.679 align:start position:0%
is what conversations have taken place
 
00:20:40.390 --> 00:20:40.400 align:start position:0%
uh with the special ed community
 
00:20:43.909 --> 00:20:43.919 align:start position:0%
and the um superintendent's community
 
00:20:45.669 --> 00:20:45.679 align:start position:0%
regarding this uh
 
00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:48.720 align:start position:0%
novel idea thank you uh thank you for
 
00:20:51.029 --> 00:20:51.039 align:start position:0%
your question representative um
 
00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
as far as i as far as the special ed
 
00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:55.760 align:start position:0%
community uh the only conversation that
 
00:20:57.669 --> 00:20:57.679 align:start position:0%
i have had personally
 
00:21:00.789 --> 00:21:00.799 align:start position:0%
um is with the coordinator at doe
 
00:21:03.350 --> 00:21:03.360 align:start position:0%
um i am aware however that uh
 
00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
commissioner edelblut has
 
00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:07.760 align:start position:0%
floated the idea or talked about the
 
00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:10.960 align:start position:0%
idea with uh with his collection of
 
00:21:12.789 --> 00:21:12.799 align:start position:0%
superintendents that meet with him on a
 
00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:14.240 align:start position:0%
regular basis
 
00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
um whether that has included any special
 
00:21:20.789 --> 00:21:20.799 align:start position:0%
ed coordinators i i don't know
 
00:21:23.669 --> 00:21:23.679 align:start position:0%
a follow-up please yes you may yeah i
 
00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:26.000 align:start position:0%
think i think this is uh important
 
00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.510 align:start position:0%
think i think this is uh important
because

00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:21:29.909 --> 00:21:29.919 align:start position:0%
obviously uh represent hill this is a
 
00:21:32.870 --> 00:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
kind of a novel idea at least from my
 
00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:34.070 align:start position:0%
kind of a novel idea at least from my
perspective

00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:36.400 align:start position:0%
uh has some potential
 
00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:38.720 align:start position:0%
um my concern though is really in
 
00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:40.480 align:start position:0%
dealing with those who
 
00:21:41.990 --> 00:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
are actually
 
00:21:43.350 --> 00:21:43.360 align:start position:0%
in the field
 
00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:45.520 align:start position:0%
having to deal with the complexities
 
00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:46.960 align:start position:0%
that you've outlined as far as the
 
00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:49.440 align:start position:0%
funding et cetera so that would be my
 
00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:51.760 align:start position:0%
concern regarding um
 
00:21:53.510 --> 00:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
moving this forward of having some kind
 
00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:55.520 align:start position:0%
of some time
 
00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:56.549 align:start position:0%
of some time
for

00:21:56.549 --> 00:21:56.559 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:21:58.470 --> 00:21:58.480 align:start position:0%
those individuals to basically look at
 
00:22:01.190 --> 00:22:01.200 align:start position:0%
this and uh to do some evaluation of it
 
00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:02.720 align:start position:0%
so uh thank you for bringing this
 
00:22:04.549 --> 00:22:04.559 align:start position:0%
forward to our committee
 
00:22:04.559 --> 00:22:06.070 align:start position:0%
forward to our committee
um

00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:06.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
welcome i i do have a quick response to
 
00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
that if that would be appropriate go
 
00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:12.710 align:start position:0%
that if that would be appropriate go
ahead

00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:12.720 align:start position:0%
ahead
 
00:22:16.149 --> 00:22:16.159 align:start position:0%
um so it would seem that uh the the
 
00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:18.640 align:start position:0%
day-to-day operations of the of the
 
00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:21.360 align:start position:0%
districts would remain the same
 
00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:22.149 align:start position:0%
districts would remain the same
um

00:22:22.149 --> 00:22:22.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:25.110 --> 00:22:25.120 align:start position:0%
the only difference that would occur
 
00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:29.120 align:start position:0%
the reimbursement that takes place
 
00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:29.990 align:start position:0%
the reimbursement that takes place
um

00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:32.149 --> 00:22:32.159 align:start position:0%
either at the end of the year
 
00:22:34.950 --> 00:22:34.960 align:start position:0%
once once the final payment is made by
 
00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
the by the department of education and
 
00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:41.120 align:start position:0%
we know what that unreimbursed amount is
 
00:22:43.669 --> 00:22:43.679 align:start position:0%
um that's when the the work of the
 
00:22:43.679 --> 00:22:45.190 align:start position:0%
um that's when the the work of the
association

00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:45.200 align:start position:0%
association
 
00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:47.600 align:start position:0%
would kick in to determine as
 
00:22:49.909 --> 00:22:49.919 align:start position:0%
rep lead or chairman lad mentioned
 
00:22:52.630 --> 00:22:52.640 align:start position:0%
whether it's 100 reimbursement of the
 
00:22:55.430 --> 00:22:55.440 align:start position:0%
unreimbursed amount or whether it's 80
 
00:22:57.029 --> 00:22:57.039 align:start position:0%
or whether it's 40
 
00:22:59.590 --> 00:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
but the work of the the the day-to-day
 
00:23:02.310 --> 00:23:02.320 align:start position:0%
work of the special ed community within
 
00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:09.990 --> 00:23:10.000 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative lay
 
00:23:11.430 --> 00:23:11.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
00:23:12.789 --> 00:23:12.799 align:start position:0%
representative hill for taking the
 
00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:15.520 align:start position:0%
question um it's a i'm just trying to
 
00:23:17.350 --> 00:23:17.360 align:start position:0%
understand something here so on on page
 
00:23:18.710 --> 00:23:18.720 align:start position:0%
two line eight
 
00:23:20.789 --> 00:23:20.799 align:start position:0%
of the uh bill of the amendment i should
 
00:23:20.799 --> 00:23:21.909 align:start position:0%
of the uh bill of the amendment i should
say

00:23:21.909 --> 00:23:21.919 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:24.080 align:start position:0%
it references or just simply says is one
 
00:23:26.710 --> 00:23:26.720 align:start position:0%
of the purposes is to minimize the state
 
00:23:30.549 --> 00:23:30.559 align:start position:0%
regulatory oversight of the pool
 
00:23:32.870 --> 00:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
so my question is simply uh why would
 
00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:36.320 align:start position:0%
that be stated as a purpose and what
 
00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:37.990 align:start position:0%
that be stated as a purpose and what
minimization

00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:38.000 align:start position:0%
minimization
 
00:23:41.430 --> 00:23:41.440 align:start position:0%
is planned here for state oversight of
 
00:23:43.669 --> 00:23:43.679 align:start position:0%
this pool
 
00:23:43.679 --> 00:23:44.789 align:start position:0%
this pool
so

00:23:44.789 --> 00:23:44.799 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:23:45.990 --> 00:23:46.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:48.480 align:start position:0%
representative the idea
 
00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
as far as the purpose statement goes
 
00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:55.440 align:start position:0%
we wanted uh the associations um which
 
00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:56.230 align:start position:0%
we wanted uh the associations um which
are

00:23:56.230 --> 00:23:56.240 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:23:59.510 --> 00:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
are run by um at least five
 
00:24:02.230 --> 00:24:02.240 align:start position:0%
uh superintendents on their board we
 
00:24:04.789 --> 00:24:04.799 align:start position:0%
wanted them to be able to control
 
00:24:09.029 --> 00:24:09.039 align:start position:0%
their product their their um idea of
 
00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
whether to self-insure it whether to
 
00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:13.520 align:start position:0%
take it to the market whether to do a
 
00:24:15.269 --> 00:24:15.279 align:start position:0%
combination of both whether to pay it at
 
00:24:18.549 --> 00:24:18.559 align:start position:0%
100 80 whatever percentage
 
00:24:20.789 --> 00:24:20.799 align:start position:0%
we didn't want that to be anything that
 
00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:25.200 align:start position:0%
was handed to them we wanted um the the
 
00:24:28.470 --> 00:24:28.480 align:start position:0%
superintendents and and the associations
 
00:24:29.990 --> 00:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
to um
 
00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
to grab this because it affects them
 
00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:35.440 align:start position:0%
more than it affects anyone else or any
 
00:24:37.669 --> 00:24:37.679 align:start position:0%
other regulation at the state
 
00:24:39.029 --> 00:24:39.039 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:41.840 align:start position:0%
this is truly an an enabling piece of
 
00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:45.360 align:start position:0%
legislation um and that enabling those
 
00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:48.720 align:start position:0%
municipal risk pools to operate
 
00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
on their on their own with very
 
00:24:53.190 --> 00:24:53.200 align:start position:0%
very slight moderate
 
00:24:56.870 --> 00:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
uh with very slight input from
 
00:24:58.789 --> 00:24:58.799 align:start position:0%
or oversight from
 
00:25:00.710 --> 00:25:00.720 align:start position:0%
the state part
 
00:25:02.549 --> 00:25:02.559 align:start position:0%
the dollars themselves are going to be
 
00:25:06.549 --> 00:25:06.559 align:start position:0%
held by the state treasurer but um but
 
00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:09.360 align:start position:0%
how the program is designed from each
 
00:25:11.909 --> 00:25:11.919 align:start position:0%
association standpoint would be up to
 
00:25:14.470 --> 00:25:14.480 align:start position:0%
them that's the point follow-up mr
 
00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
chairman yeshumi thank you um
 
00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:19.110 align:start position:0%
chairman yeshumi thank you um
so

00:25:19.110 --> 00:25:19.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:20.070 align:start position:0%
so
is

00:25:20.070 --> 00:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:25:22.149 --> 00:25:22.159 align:start position:0%
clearly there would be in some degree i
 
00:25:24.470 --> 00:25:24.480 align:start position:0%
suppose some element of risk in these
 
00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
risk pools however they're designed is
 
00:25:29.029 --> 00:25:29.039 align:start position:0%
it possible that these
 
00:25:31.669 --> 00:25:31.679 align:start position:0%
uh pools in one of the various ways that
 
00:25:33.590 --> 00:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
they're put together could actually fail
 
00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:35.840 align:start position:0%
and if so who would be liable and
 
00:25:38.149 --> 00:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
responsible then
 
00:25:41.029 --> 00:25:41.039 align:start position:0%
so there's a couple of ideas there um we
 
00:25:43.909 --> 00:25:43.919 align:start position:0%
obviously have the um
 
00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
the risk pool that would or the
 
00:25:47.510 --> 00:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
association that would create the
 
00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
documents for this so
 
00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
they have the ability to build in
 
00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:52.950 align:start position:0%
they have the ability to build in
um

00:25:52.950 --> 00:25:52.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:55.110 --> 00:25:55.120 align:start position:0%
any kind of a factor that they want to
 
00:25:59.029 --> 00:25:59.039 align:start position:0%
within their within their uh 5b
 
00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:02.240 align:start position:0%
organization schedule they can they can
 
00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:05.440 align:start position:0%
create whatever they want inside that so
 
00:26:07.590 --> 00:26:07.600 align:start position:0%
that level of risk
 
00:26:10.710 --> 00:26:10.720 align:start position:0%
can be managed at their local level the
 
00:26:12.390 --> 00:26:12.400 align:start position:0%
second part of this
 
00:26:15.430 --> 00:26:15.440 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't apply to this amendment
 
00:26:17.110 --> 00:26:17.120 align:start position:0%
which is why you don't see it referenced
 
00:26:19.269 --> 00:26:19.279 align:start position:0%
here but there's another bill coming out
 
00:26:20.549 --> 00:26:20.559 align:start position:0%
of the senate
 
00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:22.320 align:start position:0%
that will be
 
00:26:24.710 --> 00:26:24.720 align:start position:0%
a funding source that
 
00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:27.360 align:start position:0%
um i've already spoken with the senator
 
00:26:30.310 --> 00:26:30.320 align:start position:0%
and the idea is for that money to be
 
00:26:32.710 --> 00:26:32.720 align:start position:0%
utilized as a
 
00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
safety net um if if there's something
 
00:26:39.190 --> 00:26:39.200 align:start position:0%
that um that creates a problem with the
 
00:26:40.710 --> 00:26:40.720 align:start position:0%
numbers um
 
00:26:43.269 --> 00:26:43.279 align:start position:0%
so that that's the idea there's a uh
 
00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:46.240 align:start position:0%
there's a backup of fail-safe i guess
 
00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
great thank you
 
00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:49.120 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh
 
00:26:51.430 --> 00:26:51.440 align:start position:0%
represent woodcock
 
00:26:53.029 --> 00:26:53.039 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you
 
00:26:54.390 --> 00:26:54.400 align:start position:0%
representative phil for taking my
 
00:26:56.950 --> 00:26:56.960 align:start position:0%
question i have just very specific ones
 
00:26:59.510 --> 00:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
uh three actually uh
 
00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:02.000 align:start position:0%
the initial figure represents hill that
 
00:27:04.310 --> 00:27:04.320 align:start position:0%
on page one of the cost of the average
 
00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
special education per annum
 
00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
is that the catastrophic cost or is that
 
00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:11.840 align:start position:0%
the uh total student education special
 
00:27:13.990 --> 00:27:14.000 align:start position:0%
education cost per student at seventy
 
00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
four thousand dollars
 
00:27:18.390 --> 00:27:18.400 align:start position:0%
yeah that that was just taken um that's
 
00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
a doe number actually from um
 
00:27:24.310 --> 00:27:24.320 align:start position:0%
i believe the entire special ed
 
00:27:27.190 --> 00:27:27.200 align:start position:0%
um divided by um
 
00:27:28.630 --> 00:27:28.640 align:start position:0%
what they
 
00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:30.480 align:start position:0%
what they received
 
00:27:33.110 --> 00:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
or no there was their total expenses for
 
00:27:36.149 --> 00:27:36.159 align:start position:0%
that for the 2018 year
 
00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:37.600 align:start position:0%
i think divided by the number of
 
00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:39.669 align:start position:0%
i think divided by the number of
students

00:27:39.669 --> 00:27:39.679 align:start position:0%
students
 
00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:41.840 align:start position:0%
follow-up mr chair yes
 
00:27:43.669 --> 00:27:43.679 align:start position:0%
so so uh
 
00:27:47.590 --> 00:27:47.600 align:start position:0%
hill so it's not that 74 000 strictly is
 
00:27:50.230 --> 00:27:50.240 align:start position:0%
it's all the special ed youngsters
 
00:27:52.390 --> 00:27:52.400 align:start position:0%
compressed into one figure and divided
 
00:27:53.909 --> 00:27:53.919 align:start position:0%
okay i think so yeah it doesn't it
 
00:27:55.510 --> 00:27:55.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't yeah
 
00:27:58.230 --> 00:27:58.240 align:start position:0%
it wasn't meant to be a um
 
00:28:00.789 --> 00:28:00.799 align:start position:0%
you know a specific
 
00:28:02.549 --> 00:28:02.559 align:start position:0%
you know it's not down to the penny it
 
00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:05.360 align:start position:0%
was a uh it was the total number right i
 
00:28:06.710 --> 00:28:06.720 align:start position:0%
might be able to give you the numbers
 
00:28:07.669 --> 00:28:07.679 align:start position:0%
that you used
 
00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:09.360 align:start position:0%
well that's fine if i can follow just
 
00:28:10.789 --> 00:28:10.799 align:start position:0%
clarify a little further if i may miss
 
00:28:13.269 --> 00:28:13.279 align:start position:0%
the chair so i thought the bill when i
 
00:28:15.190 --> 00:28:15.200 align:start position:0%
first read it and it's always kind of
 
00:28:17.350 --> 00:28:17.360 align:start position:0%
interesting at least the amendment i
 
00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:19.840 align:start position:0%
thought it was for to have oversight of
 
00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
the catastrophic problems we don't
 
00:28:24.310 --> 00:28:24.320 align:start position:0%
anticipate but yet your your price is
 
00:28:26.070 --> 00:28:26.080 align:start position:0%
based on your figures based on all
 
00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:27.350 align:start position:0%
based on your figures based on all
students

00:28:27.350 --> 00:28:27.360 align:start position:0%
students
 
00:28:29.909 --> 00:28:29.919 align:start position:0%
um thank you for your for your question
 
00:28:29.919 --> 00:28:31.029 align:start position:0%
um thank you for your for your question
um

00:28:31.029 --> 00:28:31.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:34.470 --> 00:28:34.480 align:start position:0%
the point is um that the association i
 
00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:35.990 align:start position:0%
the point is um that the association i
believe

00:28:35.990 --> 00:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
believe
 
00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:39.360 align:start position:0%
can can decide each each uh association
 
00:28:41.830 --> 00:28:41.840 align:start position:0%
can decide whether they are
 
00:28:44.549 --> 00:28:44.559 align:start position:0%
uh targeting strictly the catastrophic
 
00:28:48.389 --> 00:28:48.399 align:start position:0%
um what used to be called cat a right um
 
00:28:51.269 --> 00:28:51.279 align:start position:0%
uh and and so that would be obviously a
 
00:28:53.909 --> 00:28:53.919 align:start position:0%
much less cost uh to each individual
 
00:28:57.990 --> 00:28:58.000 align:start position:0%
district so in in my head um
 
00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:00.240 align:start position:0%
i would expect that there would be one
 
00:29:02.230 --> 00:29:02.240 align:start position:0%
association that may do
 
00:29:04.549 --> 00:29:04.559 align:start position:0%
nothing but cat aid and and there may be
 
00:29:06.070 --> 00:29:06.080 align:start position:0%
districts that want to join that
 
00:29:09.190 --> 00:29:09.200 align:start position:0%
association for that purpose at a lower
 
00:29:11.830 --> 00:29:11.840 align:start position:0%
cost than trying to self-insure thank
 
00:29:13.669 --> 00:29:13.679 align:start position:0%
you one more fall for me and i'll be
 
00:29:16.070 --> 00:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
done mr chair thank you
 
00:29:18.470 --> 00:29:18.480 align:start position:0%
uh representative one one last one you
 
00:29:19.830 --> 00:29:19.840 align:start position:0%
talked about this is enabling
 
00:29:21.990 --> 00:29:22.000 align:start position:0%
legislation so the opportunity for local
 
00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
school districts to participate or not
 
00:29:27.029 --> 00:29:27.039 align:start position:0%
participate uh and the pro one of the
 
00:29:27.039 --> 00:29:28.310 align:start position:0%
participate uh and the pro one of the
parameters

00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:28.320 align:start position:0%
parameters
 
00:29:31.990 --> 00:29:32.000 align:start position:0%
is that it has to be a five school unit
 
00:29:33.590 --> 00:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
to participate
 
00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
as a group um but then on page 33 you're
 
00:29:39.190 --> 00:29:39.200 align:start position:0%
talking about doe being the one that
 
00:29:42.710 --> 00:29:42.720 align:start position:0%
that creates the creates the uh the uh
 
00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:43.990 align:start position:0%
that creates the creates the uh the uh
draft

00:29:43.990 --> 00:29:44.000 align:start position:0%
draft
 
00:29:45.909 --> 00:29:45.919 align:start position:0%
yeah so i was wondering if if it's
 
00:29:48.789 --> 00:29:48.799 align:start position:0%
enabling i'm sorry i lost you here if
 
00:29:50.630 --> 00:29:50.640 align:start position:0%
it's enabling legislation
 
00:29:53.750 --> 00:29:53.760 align:start position:0%
um and it's done by the five districts
 
00:29:55.510 --> 00:29:55.520 align:start position:0%
why is d.o.e going oh yeah you're on the
 
00:29:56.470 --> 00:29:56.480 align:start position:0%
screen sorry
 
00:29:58.470 --> 00:29:58.480 align:start position:0%
why why are they gonna you jumped around
 
00:30:00.789 --> 00:30:00.799 align:start position:0%
why are they going to be um uh
 
00:30:03.430 --> 00:30:03.440 align:start position:0%
controlling that group
 
00:30:05.669 --> 00:30:05.679 align:start position:0%
um purely thanks for your question
 
00:30:08.470 --> 00:30:08.480 align:start position:0%
purely for the security
 
00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:10.149 align:start position:0%
purely for the security
concerns

00:30:10.149 --> 00:30:10.159 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
00:30:11.430 --> 00:30:11.440 align:start position:0%
there are
 
00:30:14.470 --> 00:30:14.480 align:start position:0%
this this rfp that the doe is going to
 
00:30:17.830 --> 00:30:17.840 align:start position:0%
have to update periodically
 
00:30:20.870 --> 00:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:24.149 --> 00:30:24.159 align:start position:0%
specific information of uh concerning
 
00:30:27.750 --> 00:30:27.760 align:start position:0%
student privacy and uh and so the doe
 
00:30:30.230 --> 00:30:30.240 align:start position:0%
has that information it wasn't anything
 
00:30:33.190 --> 00:30:33.200 align:start position:0%
that we wanted um each association to be
 
00:30:34.389 --> 00:30:34.399 align:start position:0%
able to see
 
00:30:35.909 --> 00:30:35.919 align:start position:0%
the information that comes from a
 
00:30:37.750 --> 00:30:37.760 align:start position:0%
neighboring district or something like
 
00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:38.549 align:start position:0%
neighboring district or something like
that

00:30:38.549 --> 00:30:38.559 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:30:40.230 --> 00:30:40.240 align:start position:0%
okay thank you mr chairman thank you mr
 
00:30:42.549 --> 00:30:42.559 align:start position:0%
hill you're more than welcome
 
00:30:49.990 --> 00:30:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:51.510 --> 00:30:51.520 align:start position:0%
i can't hear you are you unmuted
 
00:30:53.430 --> 00:30:53.440 align:start position:0%

got it down now can you hear me now yes
 
00:30:59.590 --> 00:30:59.600 align:start position:0%
okay uh thank you mr chair and thank you
 
00:31:01.110 --> 00:31:01.120 align:start position:0%
representative hill for taking my
 
00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:02.070 align:start position:0%
representative hill for taking my
question

00:31:02.070 --> 00:31:02.080 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:31:05.350 --> 00:31:05.360 align:start position:0%
um i know that um there's a difference
 
00:31:07.990 --> 00:31:08.000 align:start position:0%
uh between the smaller districts and
 
00:31:10.549 --> 00:31:10.559 align:start position:0%
also poorer districts and their and the
 
00:31:14.149 --> 00:31:14.159 align:start position:0%
uh poverty rich or poverty property rich
 
00:31:17.350 --> 00:31:17.360 align:start position:0%
districts and larger districts having
 
00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:19.760 align:start position:0%
their own um like you said rainy day
 
00:31:22.149 --> 00:31:22.159 align:start position:0%
fund the smaller districts aren't able
 
00:31:25.350 --> 00:31:25.360 align:start position:0%
to to amass enough for
 
00:31:27.990 --> 00:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
for example a special ed student who
 
00:31:30.230 --> 00:31:30.240 align:start position:0%
comes into the district and is a hundred
 
00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:31.110 align:start position:0%
comes into the district and is a hundred
thousand

00:31:31.110 --> 00:31:31.120 align:start position:0%
thousand
 
00:31:32.870 --> 00:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
out of district placement
 
00:31:35.269 --> 00:31:35.279 align:start position:0%
um and they've talked about this this
 
00:31:37.029 --> 00:31:37.039 align:start position:0%
pool i'm just wondering
 
00:31:40.789 --> 00:31:40.799 align:start position:0%
if you see uh any issues
 
00:31:43.669 --> 00:31:43.679 align:start position:0%
that would um create more inequality
 
00:31:46.470 --> 00:31:46.480 align:start position:0%
among the districts uh by setting up
 
00:31:48.630 --> 00:31:48.640 align:start position:0%
this enabling legislation and not in
 
00:31:50.389 --> 00:31:50.399 align:start position:0%
other words um
 
00:31:50.399 --> 00:31:51.110 align:start position:0%
other words um
the

00:31:51.110 --> 00:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:53.840 align:start position:0%
the well-off districts will be able to
 
00:31:53.840 --> 00:31:54.710 align:start position:0%
the well-off districts will be able to
um

00:31:54.710 --> 00:31:54.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:56.310 --> 00:31:56.320 align:start position:0%
fund themselves and the smaller
 
00:31:58.470 --> 00:31:58.480 align:start position:0%
districts will they be able to
 
00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:00.720 align:start position:0%
will they be able to actually get the
 
00:32:05.350 --> 00:32:05.360 align:start position:0%
money to get into this insurance pool
 
00:32:07.190 --> 00:32:07.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question um and i
 
00:32:09.190 --> 00:32:09.200 align:start position:0%
would have thought exactly the same
 
00:32:13.269 --> 00:32:13.279 align:start position:0%
thing um until i received back from
 
00:32:13.279 --> 00:32:14.470 align:start position:0%
thing um until i received back from
caitlyn

00:32:14.470 --> 00:32:14.480 align:start position:0%
caitlyn
 
00:32:17.509 --> 00:32:17.519 align:start position:0%
at d.o.e uh the
 
00:32:20.710 --> 00:32:20.720 align:start position:0%
the she was able to split off for me
 
00:32:23.590 --> 00:32:23.600 align:start position:0%
by district the amount of money that uh
 
00:32:26.470 --> 00:32:26.480 align:start position:0%
that of those 117 districts that have
 
00:32:29.110 --> 00:32:29.120 align:start position:0%
created this rainy day fund
 
00:32:31.269 --> 00:32:31.279 align:start position:0%
she's given me the snapshot from june
 
00:32:33.190 --> 00:32:33.200 align:start position:0%
30th of last year
 
00:32:35.669 --> 00:32:35.679 align:start position:0%
and it is remarkable
 
00:32:37.909 --> 00:32:37.919 align:start position:0%
how um
 
00:32:37.919 --> 00:32:38.630 align:start position:0%
how um
how

00:32:38.630 --> 00:32:38.640 align:start position:0%
how
 
00:32:41.350 --> 00:32:41.360 align:start position:0%
these districts have uh created this
 
00:32:44.389 --> 00:32:44.399 align:start position:0%
these pools of money um in their rainy
 
00:32:47.350 --> 00:32:47.360 align:start position:0%
day funds i'll call them um
 
00:32:49.430 --> 00:32:49.440 align:start position:0%
because there's no rhyme or reason that
 
00:32:52.870 --> 00:32:52.880 align:start position:0%
shows uh a a poor district um can
 
00:32:54.789 --> 00:32:54.799 align:start position:0%
operate any differently than a than a
 
00:32:56.310 --> 00:32:56.320 align:start position:0%
wealthy district and i'll give you two
 
00:32:56.320 --> 00:32:57.430 align:start position:0%
wealthy district and i'll give you two
examples

00:32:57.430 --> 00:32:57.440 align:start position:0%
examples
 
00:32:57.440 --> 00:32:58.470 align:start position:0%
examples
um

00:32:58.470 --> 00:32:58.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:00.870 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:33:00.870 --> 00:33:00.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:02.070 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:33:02.070 --> 00:33:02.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:33:03.990 --> 00:33:04.000 align:start position:0%
looking at it um
 
00:33:06.630 --> 00:33:06.640 align:start position:0%
claremont uh claremont's able to set
 
00:33:10.389 --> 00:33:10.399 align:start position:0%
aside 220 000 into the account
 
00:33:13.110 --> 00:33:13.120 align:start position:0%
nashua has nothing in the account
 
00:33:15.430 --> 00:33:15.440 align:start position:0%
manchester has two million something in
 
00:33:17.590 --> 00:33:17.600 align:start position:0%
the account
 
00:33:19.509 --> 00:33:19.519 align:start position:0%
franklin has a hundred and eighty
 
00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
thousand in their account
 
00:33:24.630 --> 00:33:24.640 align:start position:0%
laconia has nothing um it's all over the
 
00:33:27.350 --> 00:33:27.360 align:start position:0%
board it's it's um you know there are
 
00:33:30.230 --> 00:33:30.240 align:start position:0%
some districts uh here that that go down
 
00:33:32.509 --> 00:33:32.519 align:start position:0%
to as low as uh
 
00:33:35.909 --> 00:33:35.919 align:start position:0%
43.86 in their account um
 
00:33:39.750 --> 00:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
so i'm not sure but i think
 
00:33:41.269 --> 00:33:41.279 align:start position:0%
i think the short answer to your
 
00:33:43.190 --> 00:33:43.200 align:start position:0%
question is
 
00:33:45.909 --> 00:33:45.919 align:start position:0%
um all districts can't afford not to do
 
00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
something like this
 
00:33:50.789 --> 00:33:50.799 align:start position:0%
it's a much bigger concern when they
 
00:33:52.950 --> 00:33:52.960 align:start position:0%
when they run into that cost that they
 
00:33:54.870 --> 00:33:54.880 align:start position:0%
can't control um
 
00:33:57.350 --> 00:33:57.360 align:start position:0%
this is this is much less cost uh
 
00:34:00.070 --> 00:34:00.080 align:start position:0%
predicted to be and uh
 
00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
and hopefully there is not a situation
 
00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:03.669 align:start position:0%
and hopefully there is not a situation
where

00:34:03.669 --> 00:34:03.679 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:34:05.830 --> 00:34:05.840 align:start position:0%
a district can't afford to be in this
 
00:34:07.350 --> 00:34:07.360 align:start position:0%
risk school
 
00:34:09.750 --> 00:34:09.760 align:start position:0%
could i have a follow-up mr chair uh yes
 
00:34:11.270 --> 00:34:11.280 align:start position:0%
one quick follow-up and then what i'd
 
00:34:13.750 --> 00:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
like to do is that we've had some folks
 
00:34:15.990 --> 00:34:16.000 align:start position:0%
uh that are professionals in this area
 
00:34:17.190 --> 00:34:17.200 align:start position:0%
that have been listening to our
 
00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:18.310 align:start position:0%
that have been listening to our
discussion

00:34:18.310 --> 00:34:18.320 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
00:34:20.069 --> 00:34:20.079 align:start position:0%
and i'd just like to ask them following
 
00:34:21.430 --> 00:34:21.440 align:start position:0%
your your question your follow-up
 
00:34:23.109 --> 00:34:23.119 align:start position:0%
question here uh representative tanner
 
00:34:24.950 --> 00:34:24.960 align:start position:0%
if they have any
 
00:34:26.869 --> 00:34:26.879 align:start position:0%
uh uh the
 
00:34:29.510 --> 00:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
input to what we've been discussing or
 
00:34:31.349 --> 00:34:31.359 align:start position:0%
information that we should um might want
 
00:34:33.510 --> 00:34:33.520 align:start position:0%
to take under consideration represent
 
00:34:35.669 --> 00:34:35.679 align:start position:0%
tanner go ahead with your question
 
00:34:37.829 --> 00:34:37.839 align:start position:0%
uh yes and and thank you representative
 
00:34:39.909 --> 00:34:39.919 align:start position:0%
hill for pointing that out i was more
 
00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
concerned really with the
 
00:34:44.869 --> 00:34:44.879 align:start position:0%
smaller schools like plainfield um
 
00:34:49.190 --> 00:34:49.200 align:start position:0%
so what happens to the rainy day funds
 
00:34:51.990 --> 00:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
after if they join this risk pool can
 
00:34:53.909 --> 00:34:53.919 align:start position:0%
they still maintain their rainy day
 
00:34:53.919 --> 00:34:55.349 align:start position:0%
they still maintain their rainy day
funds

00:34:55.349 --> 00:34:55.359 align:start position:0%
funds
 
00:34:57.030 --> 00:34:57.040 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for your question yes
 
00:34:58.790 --> 00:34:58.800 align:start position:0%
absolutely um
 
00:35:01.589 --> 00:35:01.599 align:start position:0%
there's no reason anyone has to join
 
00:35:03.589 --> 00:35:03.599 align:start position:0%
an association they can keep going the
 
00:35:05.990 --> 00:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
way they're they're going
 
00:35:07.990 --> 00:35:08.000 align:start position:0%
there is also
 
00:35:10.870 --> 00:35:10.880 align:start position:0%
no limitation i've already
 
00:35:12.390 --> 00:35:12.400 align:start position:0%
checked on
 
00:35:14.390 --> 00:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
this the specifics
 
00:35:17.430 --> 00:35:17.440 align:start position:0%
or the statute that governs those rainy
 
00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
day funds and it appears depending on
 
00:35:21.349 --> 00:35:21.359 align:start position:0%
how it's drafted
 
00:35:23.430 --> 00:35:23.440 align:start position:0%
at each individual district level it
 
00:35:25.030 --> 00:35:25.040 align:start position:0%
appears that they would be able to use
 
00:35:26.790 --> 00:35:26.800 align:start position:0%
those rainy day funds
 
00:35:29.349 --> 00:35:29.359 align:start position:0%
as their premium
 
00:35:31.829 --> 00:35:31.839 align:start position:0%
so-called premium for for the
 
00:35:34.710 --> 00:35:34.720 align:start position:0%
association membership um and since you
 
00:35:36.950 --> 00:35:36.960 align:start position:0%
mentioned plainfield i'm looking at it
 
00:35:39.910 --> 00:35:39.920 align:start position:0%
with two hundred and
 
00:35:41.670 --> 00:35:41.680 align:start position:0%
two hundred and thirty-five thousand
 
00:35:43.030 --> 00:35:43.040 align:start position:0%
sitting in their
 
00:35:45.750 --> 00:35:45.760 align:start position:0%
rainy day fund
 
00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:47.200 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:48.069 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
uh

00:35:48.069 --> 00:35:48.079 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:35:49.910 --> 00:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
representative hill you have uh several
 
00:35:51.910 --> 00:35:51.920 align:start position:0%
uh professionals out there one from the
 
00:35:53.829 --> 00:35:53.839 align:start position:0%
department of insurance and and the
 
00:35:56.310 --> 00:35:56.320 align:start position:0%
other from the firm in kansas
 
00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:57.109 align:start position:0%
other from the firm in kansas
um

00:35:57.109 --> 00:35:57.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:59.510 --> 00:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
could you introduce them please
 
00:36:01.430 --> 00:36:01.440 align:start position:0%
um sure you just didn't want to
 
00:36:04.230 --> 00:36:04.240 align:start position:0%
pronounce uh
 
00:36:06.390 --> 00:36:06.400 align:start position:0%
chris's christian's name right is that
 
00:36:09.349 --> 00:36:09.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:11.109 --> 00:36:11.119 align:start position:0%
so i just call him christian but
 
00:36:14.230 --> 00:36:14.240 align:start position:0%
christian is uh is uh one of the lead if
 
00:36:16.390 --> 00:36:16.400 align:start position:0%
not the lead actuary at the department
 
00:36:19.349 --> 00:36:19.359 align:start position:0%
of insurance uh christian citarella um
 
00:36:22.950 --> 00:36:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:25.270 --> 00:36:25.280 align:start position:0%
christian are you there
 
00:36:26.630 --> 00:36:26.640 align:start position:0%
i am
 
00:36:30.150 --> 00:36:30.160 align:start position:0%
and do in listening to our conversation
 
00:36:32.630 --> 00:36:32.640 align:start position:0%
uh is there anything that you might add
 
00:36:34.550 --> 00:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
from a technical perspective or might
 
00:36:38.230 --> 00:36:38.240 align:start position:0%
clarify some points that have been asked
 
00:36:41.349 --> 00:36:41.359 align:start position:0%
um no not necessarily um i was uh
 
00:36:42.870 --> 00:36:42.880 align:start position:0%
representative hill approached me about
 
00:36:45.430 --> 00:36:45.440 align:start position:0%
two years ago and uh along with
 
00:36:48.310 --> 00:36:48.320 align:start position:0%
commissioner edelbut and just uh
 
00:36:50.390 --> 00:36:50.400 align:start position:0%
asked whether this
 
00:36:54.470 --> 00:36:54.480 align:start position:0%
concept was um were this risk to to uh
 
00:36:57.750 --> 00:36:57.760 align:start position:0%
districts was an insurable risk and so
 
00:37:00.310 --> 00:37:00.320 align:start position:0%
you know um i did a very what i would
 
00:37:03.430 --> 00:37:03.440 align:start position:0%
consider a back of the envelope analysis
 
00:37:06.150 --> 00:37:06.160 align:start position:0%
of it um this isn't my area of expertise
 
00:37:09.270 --> 00:37:09.280 align:start position:0%
but in some ways
 
00:37:11.349 --> 00:37:11.359 align:start position:0%
it's a very new product
 
00:37:15.589 --> 00:37:15.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:17.270 --> 00:37:17.280 align:start position:0%
i did a like i said i did a back of the
 
00:37:19.109 --> 00:37:19.119 align:start position:0%
envelope uh
 
00:37:21.670 --> 00:37:21.680 align:start position:0%
you know estimation uh it does appear to
 
00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:23.430 align:start position:0%
you know estimation uh it does appear to
be

00:37:23.430 --> 00:37:23.440 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:37:25.589 --> 00:37:25.599 align:start position:0%
it does have the potential to be a
 
00:37:25.599 --> 00:37:26.710 align:start position:0%
it does have the potential to be a
working

00:37:26.710 --> 00:37:26.720 align:start position:0%
working
 
00:37:30.470 --> 00:37:30.480 align:start position:0%
uh insurable model um i then
 
00:37:34.069 --> 00:37:34.079 align:start position:0%
recommended that they find uh
 
00:37:34.079 --> 00:37:35.030 align:start position:0%
recommended that they find uh
folks

00:37:35.030 --> 00:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
folks
 
00:37:36.550 --> 00:37:36.560 align:start position:0%
whose expertise
 
00:37:38.390 --> 00:37:38.400 align:start position:0%
are closer to
 
00:37:40.390 --> 00:37:40.400 align:start position:0%
this particular problem um i'm a
 
00:37:42.710 --> 00:37:42.720 align:start position:0%
property and casualty actuary uh by
 
00:37:46.550 --> 00:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
training and uh this type of risk um
 
00:37:48.310 --> 00:37:48.320 align:start position:0%
lends itself more
 
00:37:52.870 --> 00:37:52.880 align:start position:0%
towards the expertise of a what what are
 
00:37:55.510 --> 00:37:55.520 align:start position:0%
called life and health actuaries uh so
 
00:37:57.670 --> 00:37:57.680 align:start position:0%
you know because of the nature of of the
 
00:37:57.680 --> 00:37:58.710 align:start position:0%
you know because of the nature of of the
risk

00:37:58.710 --> 00:37:58.720 align:start position:0%
risk
 
00:37:58.720 --> 00:37:59.430 align:start position:0%
risk
it

00:37:59.430 --> 00:37:59.440 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:38:02.390 --> 00:38:02.400 align:start position:0%
probably would lean more towards uh like
 
00:38:05.430 --> 00:38:05.440 align:start position:0%
a more more like a health risk than a
 
00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:07.200 align:start position:0%
property or casualty risk
 
00:38:09.109 --> 00:38:09.119 align:start position:0%
and so um
 
00:38:09.119 --> 00:38:10.069 align:start position:0%
and so um
they

00:38:10.069 --> 00:38:10.079 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:38:12.230 --> 00:38:12.240 align:start position:0%
they put out the rfp and uh so i just
 
00:38:14.470 --> 00:38:14.480 align:start position:0%
wanted to say uh
 
00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:16.150 align:start position:0%
wanted to say uh
um

00:38:16.150 --> 00:38:16.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:19.109 --> 00:38:19.119 align:start position:0%
andrea rome who's on the line somewhere
 
00:38:20.870 --> 00:38:20.880 align:start position:0%
from lewis and ellis
 
00:38:23.990 --> 00:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
is a very qualified uh life and health
 
00:38:27.430 --> 00:38:27.440 align:start position:0%
actuary and i've worked with the um with
 
00:38:29.270 --> 00:38:29.280 align:start position:0%
her firm in the past and so i just
 
00:38:32.470 --> 00:38:32.480 align:start position:0%
wanted to kind of lend a little
 
00:38:35.270 --> 00:38:35.280 align:start position:0%
you know legitimacy or or
 
00:38:37.430 --> 00:38:37.440 align:start position:0%
you know um credibility
 
00:38:40.390 --> 00:38:40.400 align:start position:0%
to that firm and uh what and i did take
 
00:38:42.710 --> 00:38:42.720 align:start position:0%
a look at what they produced and um the
 
00:38:46.710 --> 00:38:46.720 align:start position:0%
tool does look really really good um
 
00:38:49.109 --> 00:38:49.119 align:start position:0%
used uh several different uh actuarial
 
00:38:52.470 --> 00:38:52.480 align:start position:0%
techniques for modeling um
 
00:38:53.910 --> 00:38:53.920 align:start position:0%
does uh
 
00:38:56.870 --> 00:38:56.880 align:start position:0%
lend credence to it and um
 
00:39:00.390 --> 00:39:00.400 align:start position:0%
in the work that they produce so
 
00:39:01.829 --> 00:39:01.839 align:start position:0%
if you have questions for me i'm happy
 
00:39:03.589 --> 00:39:03.599 align:start position:0%
to but uh andrea is the person to talk
 
00:39:03.599 --> 00:39:04.470 align:start position:0%
to but uh andrea is the person to talk
to

00:39:04.470 --> 00:39:04.480 align:start position:0%

better understanding this legislation
 
00:39:35.270 --> 00:39:35.280 align:start position:0%
yes absolutely and and good morning to
 
00:39:36.950 --> 00:39:36.960 align:start position:0%
all of you and and thank you for
 
00:39:38.710 --> 00:39:38.720 align:start position:0%
inviting me here today
 
00:39:41.990 --> 00:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
uh so as was stated i'm i'm from louis
 
00:39:44.630 --> 00:39:44.640 align:start position:0%
nellis we are an actuarial firm we've
 
00:39:45.910 --> 00:39:45.920 align:start position:0%
been in
 
00:39:50.230 --> 00:39:50.240 align:start position:0%
uh business ever since 1968. uh a.m best
 
00:39:52.870 --> 00:39:52.880 align:start position:0%
regularly ranks us as one of the top
 
00:39:55.670 --> 00:39:55.680 align:start position:0%
actuarial firms in the nation
 
00:39:58.150 --> 00:39:58.160 align:start position:0%
so i'm coming to you from kansas city
 
00:39:59.990 --> 00:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:40:01.430 --> 00:40:01.440 align:start position:0%
i want to talk to you a little bit about
 
00:40:03.990 --> 00:40:04.000 align:start position:0%
the model that i built this is a cost
 
00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:05.750 align:start position:0%
the model that i built this is a cost
predictor

00:40:05.750 --> 00:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
predictor
 
00:40:08.950 --> 00:40:08.960 align:start position:0%
we use predictive analytics techniques
 
00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:10.470 align:start position:0%
we use predictive analytics techniques
to

00:40:10.470 --> 00:40:10.480 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:40:13.109 --> 00:40:13.119 align:start position:0%
try and determine
 
00:40:16.069 --> 00:40:16.079 align:start position:0%
these catastrophic costs by school
 
00:40:16.079 --> 00:40:17.910 align:start position:0%
these catastrophic costs by school
district

00:40:17.910 --> 00:40:17.920 align:start position:0%
district
 
00:40:19.750 --> 00:40:19.760 align:start position:0%
specifically the catastrophic costs
 
00:40:22.870 --> 00:40:22.880 align:start position:0%
around the special education students
 
00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:24.470 align:start position:0%
around the special education students
um

00:40:24.470 --> 00:40:24.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:27.990 --> 00:40:28.000 align:start position:0%
so i i did want to add that
 
00:40:29.910 --> 00:40:29.920 align:start position:0%
there was some concern about the smaller
 
00:40:31.430 --> 00:40:31.440 align:start position:0%
school districts because they
 
00:40:35.829 --> 00:40:35.839 align:start position:0%
particularly get hit hard by um volatile
 
00:40:35.839 --> 00:40:38.630 align:start position:0%
particularly get hit hard by um volatile
costs

00:40:38.630 --> 00:40:38.640 align:start position:0%
costs
 
00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
a student could completely blow up
 
00:40:43.670 --> 00:40:43.680 align:start position:0%
whatever they budgeted for special
 
00:40:45.430 --> 00:40:45.440 align:start position:0%
education students
 
00:40:47.349 --> 00:40:47.359 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:40:49.990 --> 00:40:50.000 align:start position:0%
i i think the plan to try and predict
 
00:40:52.710 --> 00:40:52.720 align:start position:0%
these costs and also to create a pool to
 
00:40:54.470 --> 00:40:54.480 align:start position:0%
cover some of these catastrophic costs
 
00:40:56.150 --> 00:40:56.160 align:start position:0%
is helpful for the small school
 
00:40:56.160 --> 00:40:57.589 align:start position:0%
is helpful for the small school
districts

00:40:57.589 --> 00:40:57.599 align:start position:0%
districts
 
00:40:59.510 --> 00:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
simply because it gives them more
 
00:41:01.510 --> 00:41:01.520 align:start position:0%
financial stability than they would
 
00:41:04.950 --> 00:41:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:07.270 --> 00:41:07.280 align:start position:0%
we noticed when we were building the
 
00:41:09.190 --> 00:41:09.200 align:start position:0%
predictive model that
 
00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:11.349 align:start position:0%
predictive model that
it's

00:41:11.349 --> 00:41:11.359 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:41:14.069 --> 00:41:14.079 align:start position:0%
the prior year is often very predictive
 
00:41:17.190 --> 00:41:17.200 align:start position:0%
the prior year catastrophic costs
 
00:41:19.109 --> 00:41:19.119 align:start position:0%
a lot of times are very predictive of
 
00:41:21.430 --> 00:41:21.440 align:start position:0%
what will occur
 
00:41:23.190 --> 00:41:23.200 align:start position:0%
in the following
 
00:41:25.829 --> 00:41:25.839 align:start position:0%
year but not always
 
00:41:28.790 --> 00:41:28.800 align:start position:0%
and it's those cases where
 
00:41:30.790 --> 00:41:30.800 align:start position:0%
the current year is nothing like the
 
00:41:32.870 --> 00:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
prior year where you really your budget
 
00:41:34.710 --> 00:41:34.720 align:start position:0%
gets blown up and
 
00:41:37.270 --> 00:41:37.280 align:start position:0%
and you run into financial issues
 
00:41:37.280 --> 00:41:38.390 align:start position:0%
and you run into financial issues
um

00:41:38.390 --> 00:41:38.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:41.109 --> 00:41:41.119 align:start position:0%
hence this idea to maybe create a risk
 
00:41:44.150 --> 00:41:44.160 align:start position:0%
pool so i'll stop there and i'm happy to
 
00:41:47.030 --> 00:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
answer any questions you may have
 
00:41:48.950 --> 00:41:48.960 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are are there any
 
00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:54.790 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are are there any
questions

00:41:54.790 --> 00:41:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:56.550 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:41:56.550 --> 00:41:56.560 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:41:58.870 --> 00:41:58.880 align:start position:0%
so my question is whether she could
 
00:42:01.990 --> 00:42:02.000 align:start position:0%
expand on the uh the idea of being able
 
00:42:03.109 --> 00:42:03.119 align:start position:0%
to use
 
00:42:06.230 --> 00:42:06.240 align:start position:0%
the predictor the cost predictor for
 
00:42:12.790 --> 00:42:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:15.510 --> 00:42:15.520 align:start position:0%
uh yes representative hill that's a good
 
00:42:17.510 --> 00:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
question right now we have built the
 
00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:18.710 align:start position:0%
question right now we have built the
model

00:42:18.710 --> 00:42:18.720 align:start position:0%
model
 
00:42:23.349 --> 00:42:23.359 align:start position:0%
specifically to predict cad a costs
 
00:42:24.390 --> 00:42:24.400 align:start position:0%
we do
 
00:42:26.550 --> 00:42:26.560 align:start position:0%
of the three different modeling
 
00:42:28.470 --> 00:42:28.480 align:start position:0%
techniques that are in the cost
 
00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:29.589 align:start position:0%
techniques that are in the cost
predictor

00:42:29.589 --> 00:42:29.599 align:start position:0%
predictor
 
00:42:31.589 --> 00:42:31.599 align:start position:0%
all three of them are focused on
 
00:42:34.630 --> 00:42:34.640 align:start position:0%
predicting those catastrophic costs
 
00:42:37.829 --> 00:42:37.839 align:start position:0%
there is one of the methodologies that
 
00:42:40.470 --> 00:42:40.480 align:start position:0%
we've used that also predicts
 
00:42:43.510 --> 00:42:43.520 align:start position:0%
total costs for sped students
 
00:42:45.030 --> 00:42:45.040 align:start position:0%
but the model
 
00:42:47.589 --> 00:42:47.599 align:start position:0%
the cost predictor is really focused on
 
00:42:50.790 --> 00:42:50.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:52.950 --> 00:42:52.960 align:start position:0%
uh follow-up please mr chair
 
00:42:55.510 --> 00:42:55.520 align:start position:0%
yeah one quick one from you greg then if
 
00:42:57.349 --> 00:42:57.359 align:start position:0%
there's any committee members
 
00:42:59.829 --> 00:42:59.839 align:start position:0%
yep um so i'm just trying to clarify
 
00:43:02.390 --> 00:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
some of this um would it would it be
 
00:43:04.550 --> 00:43:04.560 align:start position:0%
possible for a
 
00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:06.069 align:start position:0%
possible for a
um

00:43:06.069 --> 00:43:06.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:08.470 --> 00:43:08.480 align:start position:0%
an association one of the associations
 
00:43:11.109 --> 00:43:11.119 align:start position:0%
that started up to be able to
 
00:43:14.790 --> 00:43:14.800 align:start position:0%
accurately or or be able to predict
 
00:43:18.309 --> 00:43:18.319 align:start position:0%
or know what the premium would be to a
 
00:43:20.710 --> 00:43:20.720 align:start position:0%
district or group of districts if they
 
00:43:22.950 --> 00:43:22.960 align:start position:0%
wanted to use
 
00:43:22.960 --> 00:43:24.230 align:start position:0%
wanted to use
total

00:43:24.230 --> 00:43:24.240 align:start position:0%
total
 
00:43:26.470 --> 00:43:26.480 align:start position:0%
sped costs rather than just cat aid
 
00:43:30.950 --> 00:43:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:33.430 --> 00:43:33.440 align:start position:0%
it's possible with the tool to predict
 
00:43:35.990 --> 00:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
total costs uh but again i would say
 
00:43:37.990 --> 00:43:38.000 align:start position:0%
that this cost predictor tool is
 
00:43:40.710 --> 00:43:40.720 align:start position:0%
primarily for cat a cost
 
00:43:44.069 --> 00:43:44.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:46.550 --> 00:43:46.560 align:start position:0%
um i have a question mr chair
 
00:43:49.990 --> 00:43:50.000 align:start position:0%
oh let's see who who is leon and then
 
00:43:53.030 --> 00:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
rep rep miler has had his hand raised
 
00:43:55.829 --> 00:43:55.839 align:start position:0%
for a while so i'm not sure if that's
 
00:43:57.349 --> 00:43:57.359 align:start position:0%
old or
 
00:43:59.589 --> 00:43:59.599 align:start position:0%
um new or continuing
 
00:44:01.510 --> 00:44:01.520 align:start position:0%
yeah i'll go first with representative
 
00:44:02.950 --> 00:44:02.960 align:start position:0%
leon because she has not asked any
 
00:44:03.990 --> 00:44:04.000 align:start position:0%
questions then we'll go to
 
00:44:05.990 --> 00:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
representative milo who has had you know
 
00:44:08.470 --> 00:44:08.480 align:start position:0%
a previous opportunity
 
00:44:11.190 --> 00:44:11.200 align:start position:0%
are you thank you mister our mel you got
 
00:44:13.750 --> 00:44:13.760 align:start position:0%
take your hand your your
 
00:44:17.270 --> 00:44:17.280 align:start position:0%
okay i'll take care of it thank you yeah
 
00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:18.150 align:start position:0%
okay i'll take care of it thank you yeah
okay

00:44:18.150 --> 00:44:18.160 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:19.430 align:start position:0%
okay
leon

00:44:19.430 --> 00:44:19.440 align:start position:0%
leon
 
00:44:21.430 --> 00:44:21.440 align:start position:0%
well thank you mr chair and thank you
 
00:44:24.390 --> 00:44:24.400 align:start position:0%
miss rome this is a fascinating tool and
 
00:44:26.470 --> 00:44:26.480 align:start position:0%
i'm a former i'm an economist and former
 
00:44:28.390 --> 00:44:28.400 align:start position:0%
options trader so
 
00:44:30.150 --> 00:44:30.160 align:start position:0%
i'll try not to get too deep into these
 
00:44:31.750 --> 00:44:31.760 align:start position:0%
questions with you
 
00:44:33.990 --> 00:44:34.000 align:start position:0%
this sounds like a phenomenal model to
 
00:44:35.829 --> 00:44:35.839 align:start position:0%
look at this risk is this something
 
00:44:38.630 --> 00:44:38.640 align:start position:0%
where the more of these small districts
 
00:44:40.870 --> 00:44:40.880 align:start position:0%
participate the better that they'll be
 
00:44:43.349 --> 00:44:43.359 align:start position:0%
able to smooth those costs and
 
00:44:45.190 --> 00:44:45.200 align:start position:0%
really be able to lower that volatility
 
00:44:49.990 --> 00:44:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:53.190 --> 00:44:53.200 align:start position:0%
yes absolutely and and that goes back to
 
00:44:55.750 --> 00:44:55.760 align:start position:0%
your insurance principles of the more
 
00:44:57.510 --> 00:44:57.520 align:start position:0%
people you have in the pool the more
 
00:45:00.470 --> 00:45:00.480 align:start position:0%
likely it's going to tend towards your
 
00:45:02.710 --> 00:45:02.720 align:start position:0%
average expected costs
 
00:45:05.510 --> 00:45:05.520 align:start position:0%
um so if you can pool more of these
 
00:45:08.790 --> 00:45:08.800 align:start position:0%
small districts together the more able
 
00:45:11.430 --> 00:45:11.440 align:start position:0%
they're going to be to be predict uh
 
00:45:13.430 --> 00:45:13.440 align:start position:0%
these sped costs
 
00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:15.190 align:start position:0%
these sped costs
um

00:45:15.190 --> 00:45:15.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:17.349 --> 00:45:17.359 align:start position:0%
so yeah that's a that's a great thing to
 
00:45:19.349 --> 00:45:19.359 align:start position:0%
point out
 
00:45:21.510 --> 00:45:21.520 align:start position:0%
and if i may have a quick follow-up yes
 
00:45:22.550 --> 00:45:22.560 align:start position:0%
you may
 
00:45:25.510 --> 00:45:25.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um and are you were
 
00:45:27.190 --> 00:45:27.200 align:start position:0%
you able to see the amount that these
 
00:45:28.950 --> 00:45:28.960 align:start position:0%
districts had in their rainy day funds
 
00:45:30.870 --> 00:45:30.880 align:start position:0%
and do you have any sort of
 
00:45:33.030 --> 00:45:33.040 align:start position:0%
um judgment as to whether those costs
 
00:45:35.670 --> 00:45:35.680 align:start position:0%
would cover on say some level of
 
00:45:37.750 --> 00:45:37.760 align:start position:0%
coverage for these for these towns or if
 
00:45:43.109 --> 00:45:43.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:45.109 --> 00:45:45.119 align:start position:0%
that's something we did not look at was
 
00:45:47.270 --> 00:45:47.280 align:start position:0%
the rainy day fund
 
00:45:49.030 --> 00:45:49.040 align:start position:0%
it's something we could incorporate
 
00:45:51.510 --> 00:45:51.520 align:start position:0%
going forward and look and see kind of
 
00:45:53.430 --> 00:45:53.440 align:start position:0%
the range of results and if the rainy
 
00:45:56.069 --> 00:45:56.079 align:start position:0%
day fund would cover
 
00:45:59.349 --> 00:45:59.359 align:start position:0%
extreme cases moderately adverse cases
 
00:45:59.359 --> 00:46:00.390 align:start position:0%
extreme cases moderately adverse cases
or

00:46:00.390 --> 00:46:00.400 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:46:03.190 --> 00:46:03.200 align:start position:0%
the average of what we'd expect
 
00:46:04.870 --> 00:46:04.880 align:start position:0%
that would be fascinating thank you so
 
00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:05.990 align:start position:0%
that would be fascinating thank you so
much

00:46:05.990 --> 00:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
much
 
00:46:08.309 --> 00:46:08.319 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh are there further
 
00:46:11.349 --> 00:46:11.359 align:start position:0%
questions of miss rome
 
00:46:13.670 --> 00:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
not seeing any on my screen
 
00:46:14.870 --> 00:46:14.880 align:start position:0%
representative hobson do you see
 
00:46:16.069 --> 00:46:16.079 align:start position:0%

00:46:17.750 --> 00:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
i don't no
 
00:46:19.430 --> 00:46:19.440 align:start position:0%

specialists from from the insurance
 
00:46:24.069 --> 00:46:24.079 align:start position:0%
company and out there in kansas uh we're
 
00:46:25.990 --> 00:46:26.000 align:start position:0%
sorry your chiefs didn't do as well as
 
00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:28.230 align:start position:0%
sorry your chiefs didn't do as well as
they

00:46:28.230 --> 00:46:28.240 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:46:30.470 --> 00:46:30.480 align:start position:0%
may have but they're up against a pretty
 
00:46:32.390 --> 00:46:32.400 align:start position:0%
powerful quarterback
 
00:46:33.990 --> 00:46:34.000 align:start position:0%
from florida
 
00:46:38.150 --> 00:46:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:39.589 --> 00:46:39.599 align:start position:0%
for the rest
 
00:46:41.589 --> 00:46:41.599 align:start position:0%
thank you for the rest of the committee
 
00:46:42.550 --> 00:46:42.560 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:46:42.560 --> 00:46:44.390 align:start position:0%
right now
um

00:46:44.390 --> 00:46:44.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:46.069 --> 00:46:46.079 align:start position:0%
we don't have a motion on the floor but
 
00:46:47.670 --> 00:46:47.680 align:start position:0%
i think there's still a little room for
 
00:46:49.270 --> 00:46:49.280 align:start position:0%
some discussion
 
00:46:50.630 --> 00:46:50.640 align:start position:0%
one of the
 
00:46:52.950 --> 00:46:52.960 align:start position:0%
rep heath has her hand raised i don't
 
00:46:54.390 --> 00:46:54.400 align:start position:0%
know if she can
 
00:46:58.630 --> 00:46:58.640 align:start position:0%
represent heath thank you mr chair um
 
00:47:01.589 --> 00:47:01.599 align:start position:0%
i this is a significant
 
00:47:01.599 --> 00:47:02.470 align:start position:0%
i this is a significant
um

00:47:02.470 --> 00:47:02.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:06.550 --> 00:47:06.560 align:start position:0%
ground shaking actually shift from the
 
00:47:09.910 --> 00:47:09.920 align:start position:0%
way the department of ed has worked
 
00:47:12.470 --> 00:47:12.480 align:start position:0%
for these costs with what we formally
 
00:47:15.030 --> 00:47:15.040 align:start position:0%
know as catastrophic aid
 
00:47:18.230 --> 00:47:18.240 align:start position:0%
i am extremely concerned about um
 
00:47:20.550 --> 00:47:20.560 align:start position:0%
adopting such an amendment at this point
 
00:47:24.550 --> 00:47:24.560 align:start position:0%
in time without um a hearing uh that
 
00:47:26.790 --> 00:47:26.800 align:start position:0%
would address the concerns
 
00:47:29.270 --> 00:47:29.280 align:start position:0%
we really need to delve into this at a
 
00:47:33.510 --> 00:47:33.520 align:start position:0%
much deeper level and um unless we had a
 
00:47:35.270 --> 00:47:35.280 align:start position:0%
hearing and and
 
00:47:39.190 --> 00:47:39.200 align:start position:0%
um publicly advertise this i i really
 
00:47:41.670 --> 00:47:41.680 align:start position:0%
think this is not a good
 
00:47:43.750 --> 00:47:43.760 align:start position:0%
amendment to proceed with at this point
 
00:47:46.309 --> 00:47:46.319 align:start position:0%
in time thank you mr chair
 
00:47:47.270 --> 00:47:47.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:47:51.190 --> 00:47:51.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:54.870 --> 00:47:54.880 align:start position:0%
uh rep leon has her hand raised and uh
 
00:47:57.829 --> 00:47:57.839 align:start position:0%
representative miler
 
00:47:59.910 --> 00:47:59.920 align:start position:0%
uh i i didn't hear who the first rep was
 
00:48:03.109 --> 00:48:03.119 align:start position:0%
that you mentioned uh uh rep leon
 
00:48:04.790 --> 00:48:04.800 align:start position:0%
okay we'll go represent mile or then
 
00:48:07.829 --> 00:48:07.839 align:start position:0%
represent lyon look i would i would uh
 
00:48:10.230 --> 00:48:10.240 align:start position:0%
thank you uh mr chair i would concur
 
00:48:12.710 --> 00:48:12.720 align:start position:0%
with uh representative
 
00:48:14.550 --> 00:48:14.560 align:start position:0%
heath's comment i mean
 
00:48:17.030 --> 00:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
this is very intriguing
 
00:48:19.430 --> 00:48:19.440 align:start position:0%
and i'm i'm interested in how this might
 
00:48:19.440 --> 00:48:20.630 align:start position:0%
and i'm i'm interested in how this might
work

00:48:20.630 --> 00:48:20.640 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:21.510 align:start position:0%
work
but

00:48:21.510 --> 00:48:21.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:48:24.230 --> 00:48:24.240 align:start position:0%
unless we can really hear from those
 
00:48:25.990 --> 00:48:26.000 align:start position:0%
who would be participating in these
 
00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:28.390 align:start position:0%
who would be participating in these
collectives

00:48:28.390 --> 00:48:28.400 align:start position:0%
collectives
 
00:48:30.630 --> 00:48:30.640 align:start position:0%
and those who would benefit from these
 
00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:31.829 align:start position:0%
and those who would benefit from these
collectives

00:48:31.829 --> 00:48:31.839 align:start position:0%
collectives
 
00:48:33.510 --> 00:48:33.520 align:start position:0%
i really think
 
00:48:36.069 --> 00:48:36.079 align:start position:0%
this takes a little more time
 
00:48:38.390 --> 00:48:38.400 align:start position:0%
to look at this
 
00:48:43.510 --> 00:48:43.520 align:start position:0%
big change i mean i i i i'm intrigued
 
00:48:45.510 --> 00:48:45.520 align:start position:0%
by this
 
00:48:47.109 --> 00:48:47.119 align:start position:0%
how it might
 
00:48:50.150 --> 00:48:50.160 align:start position:0%
be implemented and that's my concern uh
 
00:48:51.829 --> 00:48:51.839 align:start position:0%
mr chair
 
00:48:53.829 --> 00:48:53.839 align:start position:0%
i think we i think it needs more time
 
00:48:53.839 --> 00:48:55.430 align:start position:0%
i think we i think it needs more time
here

00:48:55.430 --> 00:48:55.440 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:48:56.549 --> 00:48:56.559 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:48:58.950 --> 00:48:58.960 align:start position:0%
thank you representative leon you were
 
00:49:00.950 --> 00:49:00.960 align:start position:0%
the next person
 
00:49:03.190 --> 00:49:03.200 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair i do think that
 
00:49:05.030 --> 00:49:05.040 align:start position:0%
there are some very interesting points
 
00:49:07.349 --> 00:49:07.359 align:start position:0%
raised here and i would love to dig into
 
00:49:10.470 --> 00:49:10.480 align:start position:0%
these details but to me it i don't see
 
00:49:12.390 --> 00:49:12.400 align:start position:0%
where this impacts the day-to-day
 
00:49:14.710 --> 00:49:14.720 align:start position:0%
operations of education in the state i
 
00:49:17.270 --> 00:49:17.280 align:start position:0%
see this as a purely financial product
 
00:49:19.670 --> 00:49:19.680 align:start position:0%
one that is exactly the kind of risks
 
00:49:22.230 --> 00:49:22.240 align:start position:0%
that financial instruments are designed
 
00:49:23.270 --> 00:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
to cover
 
00:49:24.870 --> 00:49:24.880 align:start position:0%
and while we could have a hearing in
 
00:49:27.349 --> 00:49:27.359 align:start position:0%
education i don't i quite frankly don't
 
00:49:28.790 --> 00:49:28.800 align:start position:0%
think that we would be the appropriate
 
00:49:30.710 --> 00:49:30.720 align:start position:0%
place for a hearing to dive into the
 
00:49:33.030 --> 00:49:33.040 align:start position:0%
financial aspects of this especially
 
00:49:36.069 --> 00:49:36.079 align:start position:0%
relating to actuaries and all of the
 
00:49:38.390 --> 00:49:38.400 align:start position:0%
details that are involved i do know that
 
00:49:39.990 --> 00:49:40.000 align:start position:0%
this if it does move out of our
 
00:49:41.829 --> 00:49:41.839 align:start position:0%
committee we'll be going to finance and
 
00:49:43.270 --> 00:49:43.280 align:start position:0%
i believe that they are the perfect
 
00:49:45.829 --> 00:49:45.839 align:start position:0%
place to hear these financial details
 
00:49:47.670 --> 00:49:47.680 align:start position:0%
because that is their bread and butter
 
00:49:50.790 --> 00:49:50.800 align:start position:0%
we're policy and they have the expertise
 
00:49:52.790 --> 00:49:52.800 align:start position:0%
to look at risk analysis models and
 
00:49:54.630 --> 00:49:54.640 align:start position:0%
insurance modeling
 
00:49:57.190 --> 00:49:57.200 align:start position:0%
thank you representative tanner
 
00:49:58.790 --> 00:49:58.800 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for taking my question
 
00:50:00.230 --> 00:50:00.240 align:start position:0%
while i thoroughly agree with
 
00:50:02.790 --> 00:50:02.800 align:start position:0%
representative leon uh the small
 
00:50:05.190 --> 00:50:05.200 align:start position:0%
districts up as i said before up in my
 
00:50:07.750 --> 00:50:07.760 align:start position:0%
area have been kind of looking at this
 
00:50:10.230 --> 00:50:10.240 align:start position:0%
um as a possibility
 
00:50:13.510 --> 00:50:13.520 align:start position:0%
for a number of years now um they
 
00:50:16.790 --> 00:50:16.800 align:start position:0%
they've talked about it and i do think
 
00:50:18.870 --> 00:50:18.880 align:start position:0%
that there's a policy side to this as
 
00:50:18.880 --> 00:50:19.670 align:start position:0%
that there's a policy side to this as
well

00:50:19.670 --> 00:50:19.680 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:50:22.390 --> 00:50:22.400 align:start position:0%
um that needs to be
 
00:50:26.549 --> 00:50:26.559 align:start position:0%
looked at um more in depth uh about how
 
00:50:27.829 --> 00:50:27.839 align:start position:0%
it's going to
 
00:50:29.270 --> 00:50:29.280 align:start position:0%
play out on
 
00:50:31.910 --> 00:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
in these small school districts um how
 
00:50:35.190 --> 00:50:35.200 align:start position:0%
the payments are made uh you know what
 
00:50:36.870 --> 00:50:36.880 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
00:50:39.430 --> 00:50:39.440 align:start position:0%
questions superintendents and business
 
00:50:41.109 --> 00:50:41.119 align:start position:0%
managers will have
 
00:50:44.790 --> 00:50:44.800 align:start position:0%
about the the initial setup of
 
00:50:46.790 --> 00:50:46.800 align:start position:0%
the way it's um you know the
 
00:50:49.190 --> 00:50:49.200 align:start position:0%
associations are put together uh how
 
00:50:51.750 --> 00:50:51.760 align:start position:0%
people can leave the associations or not
 
00:50:54.309 --> 00:50:54.319 align:start position:0%
that sort of thing so i would agree with
 
00:50:55.990 --> 00:50:56.000 align:start position:0%
representative heath
 
00:50:57.990 --> 00:50:58.000 align:start position:0%
that um
 
00:50:59.910 --> 00:50:59.920 align:start position:0%
it's really intriguing
 
00:51:02.309 --> 00:51:02.319 align:start position:0%
like i said uh districts in my area
 
00:51:04.390 --> 00:51:04.400 align:start position:0%
small small districts have been looking
 
00:51:06.309 --> 00:51:06.319 align:start position:0%
at this possibility
 
00:51:08.790 --> 00:51:08.800 align:start position:0%
um i'd like to pursue it further but i
 
00:51:08.800 --> 00:51:10.150 align:start position:0%
um i'd like to pursue it further but i
really

00:51:10.150 --> 00:51:10.160 align:start position:0%
really
 
00:51:12.390 --> 00:51:12.400 align:start position:0%
think that you know they would like a
 
00:51:13.829 --> 00:51:13.839 align:start position:0%
chance to come in and ask their
 
00:51:15.589 --> 00:51:15.599 align:start position:0%
questions as well so
 
00:51:15.599 --> 00:51:16.470 align:start position:0%
questions as well so
um

00:51:16.470 --> 00:51:16.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:18.950 --> 00:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
that's that's what i have to say
 
00:51:20.230 --> 00:51:20.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:51:23.589 --> 00:51:23.599 align:start position:0%
um i i just like to go back to daily
 
00:51:26.309 --> 00:51:26.319 align:start position:0%
day-to-day operations that uh we've
 
00:51:28.950 --> 00:51:28.960 align:start position:0%
heard that that terminology used and
 
00:51:30.549 --> 00:51:30.559 align:start position:0%
there's a district that's just south of
 
00:51:30.559 --> 00:51:31.430 align:start position:0%
there's a district that's just south of
me

00:51:31.430 --> 00:51:31.440 align:start position:0%
me
 
00:51:33.829 --> 00:51:33.839 align:start position:0%
that had two
 
00:51:36.069 --> 00:51:36.079 align:start position:0%
cad aid i you know we should be using
 
00:51:38.150 --> 00:51:38.160 align:start position:0%
the word special education aid
 
00:51:40.710 --> 00:51:40.720 align:start position:0%
but that that these two youngsters
 
00:51:42.790 --> 00:51:42.800 align:start position:0%
appeared in the same year
 
00:51:45.190 --> 00:51:45.200 align:start position:0%
and had not been enrolled the previous
 
00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:46.230 align:start position:0%
and had not been enrolled the previous
year

00:51:46.230 --> 00:51:46.240 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:51:48.470 --> 00:51:48.480 align:start position:0%
and this is a small district with under
 
00:51:51.430 --> 00:51:51.440 align:start position:0%
a hundred students in it
 
00:51:54.710 --> 00:51:54.720 align:start position:0%
it was totally devastating
 
00:51:54.720 --> 00:51:55.589 align:start position:0%
it was totally devastating
and

00:51:55.589 --> 00:51:55.599 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:51:59.109 --> 00:51:59.119 align:start position:0%
it it did impact their uh
 
00:51:59.119 --> 00:52:00.470 align:start position:0%
it it did impact their uh
operations

00:52:00.470 --> 00:52:00.480 align:start position:0%
operations
 
00:52:02.309 --> 00:52:02.319 align:start position:0%
in terms of they were seeking dollars
 
00:52:04.470 --> 00:52:04.480 align:start position:0%
from any avenue or venue they could find
 
00:52:06.710 --> 00:52:06.720 align:start position:0%
within their budget to support this this
 
00:52:08.549 --> 00:52:08.559 align:start position:0%
need which they're required by law to
 
00:52:08.559 --> 00:52:09.670 align:start position:0%
need which they're required by law to
provide

00:52:09.670 --> 00:52:09.680 align:start position:0%
provide
 
00:52:11.990 --> 00:52:12.000 align:start position:0%
and they didn't they were not objecting
 
00:52:15.109 --> 00:52:15.119 align:start position:0%
to you know you know the the need it's
 
00:52:18.470 --> 00:52:18.480 align:start position:0%
just that it was a total financial
 
00:52:21.589 --> 00:52:21.599 align:start position:0%
issue that you know meant either in in
 
00:52:24.230 --> 00:52:24.240 align:start position:0%
their their their reserve fund the the
 
00:52:25.910 --> 00:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
monies which they put aside in this
 
00:52:28.549 --> 00:52:28.559 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing reserve they it was just
 
00:52:30.630 --> 00:52:30.640 align:start position:0%
basically nothing there
 
00:52:33.030 --> 00:52:33.040 align:start position:0%
uh they've never had the wherewithal to
 
00:52:34.549 --> 00:52:34.559 align:start position:0%
put something into that account it's
 
00:52:36.390 --> 00:52:36.400 align:start position:0%
probably one of those districts with 46
 
00:52:38.390 --> 00:52:38.400 align:start position:0%
dollars and some odd cents
 
00:52:39.990 --> 00:52:40.000 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:52:42.710 --> 00:52:42.720 align:start position:0%
it is a real pressing issue
 
00:52:42.720 --> 00:52:43.750 align:start position:0%
it is a real pressing issue
and

00:52:43.750 --> 00:52:43.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:52:45.349 --> 00:52:45.359 align:start position:0%
i i
 
00:52:47.510 --> 00:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
i think for it to continue i don't want
 
00:52:49.670 --> 00:52:49.680 align:start position:0%
to see something like this die
 
00:52:52.309 --> 00:52:52.319 align:start position:0%
uh we need to really look at a way to
 
00:52:55.030 --> 00:52:55.040 align:start position:0%
get out of this this path we've been in
 
00:52:57.030 --> 00:52:57.040 align:start position:0%
ever since i've been in the house and
 
00:53:00.150 --> 00:53:00.160 align:start position:0%
heard about this it's been a question
 
00:53:03.270 --> 00:53:03.280 align:start position:0%
and how do we fund this this special
 
00:53:05.829 --> 00:53:05.839 align:start position:0%
education aid and and there's so many
 
00:53:05.839 --> 00:53:07.190 align:start position:0%
education aid and and there's so many
unknowns

00:53:07.190 --> 00:53:07.200 align:start position:0%
unknowns
 
00:53:07.200 --> 00:53:07.990 align:start position:0%
unknowns
so

00:53:07.990 --> 00:53:08.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:53:10.950 --> 00:53:10.960 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm i would like to see
 
00:53:12.870 --> 00:53:12.880 align:start position:0%
something occur i'm not objecting
 
00:53:14.870 --> 00:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
necessarily to having hearings i think
 
00:53:17.589 --> 00:53:17.599 align:start position:0%
what represent leon said is correct that
 
00:53:20.150 --> 00:53:20.160 align:start position:0%
we're now recognizing by policy we've
 
00:53:22.150 --> 00:53:22.160 align:start position:0%
got to do something
 
00:53:26.069 --> 00:53:26.079 align:start position:0%
and this is the best uh idea that i've
 
00:53:28.790 --> 00:53:28.800 align:start position:0%
seen come down regarding how we handle
 
00:53:31.270 --> 00:53:31.280 align:start position:0%
catastrophic aid with developing
 
00:53:33.190 --> 00:53:33.200 align:start position:0%
individual associations which is
 
00:53:35.910 --> 00:53:35.920 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation you can take your
 
00:53:37.829 --> 00:53:37.839 align:start position:0%
five or six or seven districts around
 
00:53:40.549 --> 00:53:40.559 align:start position:0%
about one certain area where a child
 
00:53:42.470 --> 00:53:42.480 align:start position:0%
might be bound
 
00:53:44.470 --> 00:53:44.480 align:start position:0%
they usually move from one district to
 
00:53:44.480 --> 00:53:45.589 align:start position:0%
they usually move from one district to
another

00:53:45.589 --> 00:53:45.599 align:start position:0%
another
 
00:53:47.670 --> 00:53:47.680 align:start position:0%
when they either become unhappy with the
 
00:53:50.150 --> 00:53:50.160 align:start position:0%
way it's been provided in past or they
 
00:53:52.230 --> 00:53:52.240 align:start position:0%
they they have to move for economics
 
00:53:54.309 --> 00:53:54.319 align:start position:0%
within the family
 
00:53:56.870 --> 00:53:56.880 align:start position:0%
and so i i would like to see us you know
 
00:53:58.870 --> 00:53:58.880 align:start position:0%
push this forward and have that
 
00:54:01.589 --> 00:54:01.599 align:start position:0%
discussion within the committee which
 
00:54:03.670 --> 00:54:03.680 align:start position:0%
looks for this type of discussion
 
00:54:05.510 --> 00:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
education finance
 
00:54:07.910 --> 00:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
and if they deem it necessary to put
 
00:54:10.390 --> 00:54:10.400 align:start position:0%
this off for a year then i will respect
 
00:54:12.790 --> 00:54:12.800 align:start position:0%
that motion but i i i think we'd be in
 
00:54:15.510 --> 00:54:15.520 align:start position:0%
air if we tried to hold this for another
 
00:54:17.030 --> 00:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
another go around
 
00:54:19.349 --> 00:54:19.359 align:start position:0%
especially during covet
 
00:54:20.470 --> 00:54:20.480 align:start position:0%
uh further
 
00:54:23.430 --> 00:54:23.440 align:start position:0%
mr chair we have a hand raised from
 
00:54:25.190 --> 00:54:25.200 align:start position:0%
representative leon and then
 
00:54:27.430 --> 00:54:27.440 align:start position:0%
representative lay
 
00:54:28.390 --> 00:54:28.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:54:29.910 --> 00:54:29.920 align:start position:0%
represent leon
 
00:54:32.470 --> 00:54:32.480 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair uh representative
 
00:54:34.230 --> 00:54:34.240 align:start position:0%
tanner i think brings up a good point
 
00:54:36.549 --> 00:54:36.559 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure how many of her districts
 
00:54:38.950 --> 00:54:38.960 align:start position:0%
are looking for a product like this
 
00:54:38.960 --> 00:54:39.750 align:start position:0%
are looking for a product like this
um

00:54:39.750 --> 00:54:39.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:42.470 --> 00:54:42.480 align:start position:0%
if if there are districts within within
 
00:54:45.349 --> 00:54:45.359 align:start position:0%
her area that need this and potentially
 
00:54:47.510 --> 00:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
one of the ones near chairman ladd is in
 
00:54:50.230 --> 00:54:50.240 align:start position:0%
need of this that may already be five
 
00:54:52.309 --> 00:54:52.319 align:start position:0%
districts who may choose under this
 
00:54:54.549 --> 00:54:54.559 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation to further pursue
 
00:54:57.349 --> 00:54:57.359 align:start position:0%
this on a policy basis i think that that
 
00:54:59.030 --> 00:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
actually demonstrates the need and
 
00:55:00.950 --> 00:55:00.960 align:start position:0%
because this doesn't force anybody to
 
00:55:03.270 --> 00:55:03.280 align:start position:0%
take any particular actions
 
00:55:05.670 --> 00:55:05.680 align:start position:0%
i think that this is an opportunity that
 
00:55:08.309 --> 00:55:08.319 align:start position:0%
we owe to these towns we need to let
 
00:55:10.069 --> 00:55:10.079 align:start position:0%
this go to finance so that they can work
 
00:55:12.230 --> 00:55:12.240 align:start position:0%
through the details on it but i think we
 
00:55:14.390 --> 00:55:14.400 align:start position:0%
owe them the opportunity to solve this
 
00:55:14.400 --> 00:55:15.670 align:start position:0%
owe them the opportunity to solve this
problem

00:55:15.670 --> 00:55:15.680 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:55:17.109 --> 00:55:17.119 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:55:18.790 --> 00:55:18.800 align:start position:0%
representative lay
 
00:55:21.109 --> 00:55:21.119 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um would it be
 
00:55:23.430 --> 00:55:23.440 align:start position:0%
appropriate that if this amendment were
 
00:55:25.190 --> 00:55:25.200 align:start position:0%
adopted that this bill actually should
 
00:55:27.349 --> 00:55:27.359 align:start position:0%
go to commerce as a second policy
 
00:55:28.710 --> 00:55:28.720 align:start position:0%
committee because it does deal with
 
00:55:30.950 --> 00:55:30.960 align:start position:0%
insurance and that's what commerce does
 
00:55:31.990 --> 00:55:32.000 align:start position:0%
as well
 
00:55:33.589 --> 00:55:33.599 align:start position:0%
before it goes to finance that's
 
00:55:34.950 --> 00:55:34.960 align:start position:0%
question one
 
00:55:37.270 --> 00:55:37.280 align:start position:0%
and then this my second question
 
00:55:37.280 --> 00:55:38.630 align:start position:0%
and then this my second question
is

00:55:38.630 --> 00:55:38.640 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:55:41.109 --> 00:55:41.119 align:start position:0%
if if this is beneficial and and it
 
00:55:43.670 --> 00:55:43.680 align:start position:0%
seems like it has potential
 
00:55:45.910 --> 00:55:45.920 align:start position:0%
what is the what is the benefit or what
 
00:55:46.870 --> 00:55:46.880 align:start position:0%
is why
 
00:55:48.630 --> 00:55:48.640 align:start position:0%
what would be the preference
 
00:55:50.470 --> 00:55:50.480 align:start position:0%
currently now it seems to be to have a
 
00:55:52.789 --> 00:55:52.799 align:start position:0%
number of these smaller pools why not
 
00:55:55.109 --> 00:55:55.119 align:start position:0%
have a single statewide pool that any
 
00:55:58.230 --> 00:55:58.240 align:start position:0%
district could enter into
 
00:56:00.390 --> 00:56:00.400 align:start position:0%
represent lay you asked two wonderful
 
00:56:00.400 --> 00:56:01.990 align:start position:0%
represent lay you asked two wonderful
questions

00:56:01.990 --> 00:56:02.000 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:56:03.109 --> 00:56:03.119 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:56:05.030 --> 00:56:05.040 align:start position:0%
and not necessarily questions the first
 
00:56:07.910 --> 00:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
one is is very accurate in the past we
 
00:56:09.990 --> 00:56:10.000 align:start position:0%
have had bills that need to go to a
 
00:56:12.630 --> 00:56:12.640 align:start position:0%
second and a third committee and that's
 
00:56:16.309 --> 00:56:16.319 align:start position:0%
very plausible and i agree this is uh
 
00:56:18.309 --> 00:56:18.319 align:start position:0%
has to deal with commerce
 
00:56:21.430 --> 00:56:21.440 align:start position:0%
and and uh it'd probably be apropos that
 
00:56:23.190 --> 00:56:23.200 align:start position:0%
something like this occur
 
00:56:25.589 --> 00:56:25.599 align:start position:0%
uh they're the ones that would be able
 
00:56:27.910 --> 00:56:27.920 align:start position:0%
to delve into some of w where this is
 
00:56:29.910 --> 00:56:29.920 align:start position:0%
coming from how we manage it
 
00:56:29.920 --> 00:56:31.510 align:start position:0%
coming from how we manage it
etc

00:56:31.510 --> 00:56:31.520 align:start position:0%
etc
 
00:56:33.510 --> 00:56:33.520 align:start position:0%
more so than i think education policy
 
00:56:36.630 --> 00:56:36.640 align:start position:0%
can i have heard nobody say this is
 
00:56:38.549 --> 00:56:38.559 align:start position:0%
downright wrong
 
00:56:40.390 --> 00:56:40.400 align:start position:0%
there's folks that have been raising
 
00:56:42.470 --> 00:56:42.480 align:start position:0%
those questions which are legitimate
 
00:56:42.480 --> 00:56:43.990 align:start position:0%
those questions which are legitimate
concerns

00:56:43.990 --> 00:56:44.000 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
00:56:46.309 --> 00:56:46.319 align:start position:0%
but we all recognize that catastrophic
 
00:56:48.470 --> 00:56:48.480 align:start position:0%
aid needs to be
 
00:56:49.829 --> 00:56:49.839 align:start position:0%
looked at
 
00:56:51.670 --> 00:56:51.680 align:start position:0%
and for us to
 
00:56:53.990 --> 00:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
put this into another small subcommittee
 
00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:55.030 align:start position:0%
put this into another small subcommittee
within

00:56:55.030 --> 00:56:55.040 align:start position:0%
within
 
00:56:55.040 --> 00:56:55.829 align:start position:0%
within
uh

00:56:55.829 --> 00:56:55.839 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:56:58.710 --> 00:56:58.720 align:start position:0%
our group right here i personally don't
 
00:57:00.630 --> 00:57:00.640 align:start position:0%
think we're loaded with the
 
00:57:03.910 --> 00:57:03.920 align:start position:0%
the expertise that this bill other
 
00:57:05.510 --> 00:57:05.520 align:start position:0%
representative leon you i'm not
 
00:57:08.870 --> 00:57:08.880 align:start position:0%
degrading your background but uh mine is
 
00:57:11.589 --> 00:57:11.599 align:start position:0%
that of an educator of being a teacher
 
00:57:14.230 --> 00:57:14.240 align:start position:0%
being a school principal
 
00:57:16.470 --> 00:57:16.480 align:start position:0%
i would love to see something like this
 
00:57:19.670 --> 00:57:19.680 align:start position:0%
occur i as an administrator
 
00:57:19.680 --> 00:57:20.710 align:start position:0%
occur i as an administrator
had

00:57:20.710 --> 00:57:20.720 align:start position:0%
had
 
00:57:23.430 --> 00:57:23.440 align:start position:0%
always looked at where can i steal some
 
00:57:25.589 --> 00:57:25.599 align:start position:0%
money to support the ever increasing
 
00:57:27.990 --> 00:57:28.000 align:start position:0%
costs on this side of the ledger
 
00:57:30.870 --> 00:57:30.880 align:start position:0%
but it was robbing peter to play paul
 
00:57:32.470 --> 00:57:32.480 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:57:34.630 --> 00:57:34.640 align:start position:0%
truthfully i would love to see this bill
 
00:57:36.710 --> 00:57:36.720 align:start position:0%
float on to another policy-oriented
 
00:57:38.549 --> 00:57:38.559 align:start position:0%
committee that had some other horses to
 
00:57:41.030 --> 00:57:41.040 align:start position:0%
ask the questions that i think represent
 
00:57:45.829 --> 00:57:45.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:48.950 --> 00:57:48.960 align:start position:0%
further understandings here
 
00:57:51.109 --> 00:57:51.119 align:start position:0%
i'll certainly defer to representative
 
00:57:51.119 --> 00:57:52.870 align:start position:0%

um i i i would prefer to try if it to
 
00:59:05.910 --> 00:59:05.920 align:start position:0%
have a motion which we dealt with the
 
00:59:08.069 --> 00:59:08.079 align:start position:0%
most current amendment rather than this
 
00:59:08.079 --> 00:59:09.430 align:start position:0%
most current amendment rather than this
and

00:59:09.430 --> 00:59:09.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:59:11.910 --> 00:59:11.920 align:start position:0%
ols i know is swamped representative
 
00:59:14.950 --> 00:59:14.960 align:start position:0%
cordelli could you please contact ols
 
00:59:18.630 --> 00:59:18.640 align:start position:0%
and find out what the status of this is
 
00:59:22.710 --> 00:59:22.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:25.670 --> 00:59:25.680 align:start position:0%
okay um so i'm not going to be accepting
 
00:59:27.270 --> 00:59:27.280 align:start position:0%
a motion on this at this particular
 
00:59:27.280 --> 00:59:29.270 align:start position:0%
a motion on this at this particular
point

00:59:29.270 --> 00:59:29.280 align:start position:0%
point
 
00:59:29.280 --> 00:59:31.349 align:start position:0%
point
so

00:59:31.349 --> 00:59:31.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:59:33.670 --> 00:59:33.680 align:start position:0%
i guess what we can do is that if is
 
00:59:35.990 --> 00:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
there anything else that you know we we
 
00:59:39.109 --> 00:59:39.119 align:start position:0%

time allows
um

01:00:13.109 --> 01:00:13.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:14.870 --> 01:00:14.880 align:start position:0%
that that is an issue that we did
 
01:00:18.309 --> 01:00:18.319 align:start position:0%
discuss earlier um and we we did retain
 
01:00:20.069 --> 01:00:20.079 align:start position:0%
one bill 214
 
01:00:23.270 --> 01:00:23.280 align:start position:0%
and we were looking at 594 as possibly
 
01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:24.150 align:start position:0%
and we were looking at 594 as possibly
um

01:00:24.150 --> 01:00:24.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:26.470 --> 01:00:26.480 align:start position:0%
trying to address some of the issues
 
01:00:29.510 --> 01:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
that we see and that we can come to
 
01:00:32.630 --> 01:00:32.640 align:start position:0%
grasp are in terms of a common
 
01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:33.589 align:start position:0%
grasp are in terms of a common
goal

01:00:33.589 --> 01:00:33.599 align:start position:0%
goal
 
01:00:37.510 --> 01:00:37.520 align:start position:0%
to move 594 forward
 
01:00:39.190 --> 01:00:39.200 align:start position:0%
i did have a
 
01:00:42.150 --> 01:00:42.160 align:start position:0%
amendment for that that has been sent
 
01:00:43.750 --> 01:00:43.760 align:start position:0%
out by
 
01:00:46.069 --> 01:00:46.079 align:start position:0%
ols this morning and i ask that it be
 
01:00:48.549 --> 01:00:48.559 align:start position:0%
sent to all committee members
 
01:00:52.870 --> 01:00:52.880 align:start position:0%
uh i'll ask if anybody's received that
 
01:00:56.710 --> 01:00:56.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:56.720 --> 01:01:00.789 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:01:00.789 --> 01:01:00.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:03.109 --> 01:01:03.119 align:start position:0%
so what we can do now uh until
 
01:01:05.670 --> 01:01:05.680 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli um
 
01:01:08.069 --> 01:01:08.079 align:start position:0%

yep are we okay out there
 
01:01:22.150 --> 01:01:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:24.390 --> 01:01:24.400 align:start position:0%
okay so what we're gonna do is
 
01:01:27.430 --> 01:01:27.440 align:start position:0%
um we'll take about 20 minutes here and
 
01:01:29.829 --> 01:01:29.839 align:start position:0%
try to do some follow-up with ols and
 
01:01:33.589 --> 01:01:33.599 align:start position:0%
come back my my uh time says about 1002
 
01:01:36.069 --> 01:01:36.079 align:start position:0%

thank you barb representatives do you
 
01:02:19.190 --> 01:02:19.200 align:start position:0%

01:02:22.069 --> 01:02:22.079 align:start position:0%
well i just um it was sort of question
 
01:02:24.069 --> 01:02:24.079 align:start position:0%
comment i'm not sure which
 
01:02:24.079 --> 01:02:25.510 align:start position:0%
comment i'm not sure which
um

01:02:25.510 --> 01:02:25.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:27.750 --> 01:02:27.760 align:start position:0%
as far as a statewide
 
01:02:30.230 --> 01:02:30.240 align:start position:0%
one this it looks to me like it could
 
01:02:33.109 --> 01:02:33.119 align:start position:0%
potentially grow to be one statewide one
 
01:02:34.390 --> 01:02:34.400 align:start position:0%
if that's what
 
01:02:36.470 --> 01:02:36.480 align:start position:0%
towns wanted to do am i right or wrong
 
01:02:39.670 --> 01:02:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:41.910 --> 01:02:41.920 align:start position:0%
i i i don't have an answer for that it's
 
01:02:44.950 --> 01:02:44.960 align:start position:0%
all conjecture right now uh it's it's
 
01:02:47.109 --> 01:02:47.119 align:start position:0%
the those associations are locally
 
01:02:49.990 --> 01:02:50.000 align:start position:0%
brewed and designed and
 
01:02:52.230 --> 01:02:52.240 align:start position:0%
they decide how much they're gonna what
 
01:02:54.230 --> 01:02:54.240 align:start position:0%
kind of premium they're gonna have and
 
01:02:55.990 --> 01:02:56.000 align:start position:0%
maybe a wealthy district may have some
 
01:02:58.630 --> 01:02:58.640 align:start position:0%
money still in that reserve rainy day
 
01:03:00.549 --> 01:03:00.559 align:start position:0%
account and they use that to pay their
 
01:03:02.870 --> 01:03:02.880 align:start position:0%
premiums or the difference between
 
01:03:05.589 --> 01:03:05.599 align:start position:0%
you know the the premium and and what
 
01:03:08.630 --> 01:03:08.640 align:start position:0%
the actual costs of this special student
 
01:03:09.750 --> 01:03:09.760 align:start position:0%
may be
 
01:03:12.950 --> 01:03:12.960 align:start position:0%
so um i i couldn't venture a guess on
 
01:03:17.670 --> 01:03:17.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:20.549 --> 01:03:20.559 align:start position:0%
uh mr chairman if i might yes
 
01:03:23.270 --> 01:03:23.280 align:start position:0%
um i contacted ols and they're checking
 
01:03:25.029 --> 01:03:25.039 align:start position:0%
on the status of that and will call me
 
01:03:25.039 --> 01:03:26.309 align:start position:0%
on the status of that and will call me
back

01:03:26.309 --> 01:03:26.319 align:start position:0%
back
 
01:03:26.319 --> 01:03:27.270 align:start position:0%
back
okay

01:03:27.270 --> 01:03:27.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:03:30.470 --> 01:03:30.480 align:start position:0%
rep leon has a hand raised represented
 
01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:31.430 align:start position:0%
rep leon has a hand raised represented
leon

01:03:31.430 --> 01:03:31.440 align:start position:0%
leon
 
01:03:34.150 --> 01:03:34.160 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair it's uh to my i'm
 
01:03:36.390 --> 01:03:36.400 align:start position:0%
speaking to the point of the
 
01:03:39.270 --> 01:03:39.280 align:start position:0%
this growing to a statewide pool i think
 
01:03:41.270 --> 01:03:41.280 align:start position:0%
that the way that it's written it has
 
01:03:43.270 --> 01:03:43.280 align:start position:0%
the flexibility where it can grow to
 
01:03:45.750 --> 01:03:45.760 align:start position:0%
whichever size is most most efficient
 
01:03:48.549 --> 01:03:48.559 align:start position:0%
and competing pools can better serve
 
01:03:50.309 --> 01:03:50.319 align:start position:0%
different needs so i think it's
 
01:03:53.349 --> 01:03:53.359 align:start position:0%
fascinating i also do think that even
 
01:03:55.829 --> 01:03:55.839 align:start position:0%
though this is my area of expertise this
 
01:03:57.990 --> 01:03:58.000 align:start position:0%
is where i would be asking questions of
 
01:03:59.910 --> 01:03:59.920 align:start position:0%
people who know this better which is why
 
01:04:01.430 --> 01:04:01.440 align:start position:0%
i do think that it goes well to another
 
01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:02.549 align:start position:0%
i do think that it goes well to another
committee

01:04:02.549 --> 01:04:02.559 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:04:04.309 --> 01:04:04.319 align:start position:0%
yeah well that thank you very much the
 
01:04:05.670 --> 01:04:05.680 align:start position:0%
other option which we can do right now
 
01:04:07.349 --> 01:04:07.359 align:start position:0%
and i think i will do this is that we
 
01:04:09.829 --> 01:04:09.839 align:start position:0%
had another bill to exact today
 
01:04:11.589 --> 01:04:11.599 align:start position:0%
that we can jump around we always have
 
01:04:11.599 --> 01:04:12.870 align:start position:0%
that we can jump around we always have
before

01:04:12.870 --> 01:04:12.880 align:start position:0%
before
 
01:04:17.430 --> 01:04:17.440 align:start position:0%
in our exec sessions uh hb 607 education
 
01:04:19.349 --> 01:04:19.359 align:start position:0%
savings account
 
01:04:22.630 --> 01:04:22.640 align:start position:0%
and then come back and resolve uh 613
 
01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:23.710 align:start position:0%
and then come back and resolve uh 613
following

01:04:23.710 --> 01:04:23.720 align:start position:0%
following
 
01:04:23.720 --> 01:04:25.670 align:start position:0%
following
607.

01:04:25.670 --> 01:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
607.
 
01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:26.870 align:start position:0%
607.
so

01:04:26.870 --> 01:04:26.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:04:29.349 --> 01:04:29.359 align:start position:0%
mr chair rep uh mullen has her hand
 
01:04:32.390 --> 01:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
raised and i just saw rep mylar have has
 
01:04:34.710 --> 01:04:34.720 align:start position:0%
his hand raised as well yes represent
 
01:04:37.270 --> 01:04:37.280 align:start position:0%
mullen thank you uh mr chairman and
 
01:04:39.029 --> 01:04:39.039 align:start position:0%
thank you representative hobson for
 
01:04:40.390 --> 01:04:40.400 align:start position:0%
paying attention
 
01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:41.829 align:start position:0%
paying attention
um

01:04:41.829 --> 01:04:41.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:44.710 --> 01:04:44.720 align:start position:0%
i just do we have any information from
 
01:04:47.190 --> 01:04:47.200 align:start position:0%
other places in the country where this
 
01:04:51.990 --> 01:04:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:53.910 --> 01:04:53.920 align:start position:0%
i do not have any information myself on
 
01:04:55.349 --> 01:04:55.359 align:start position:0%
that no
 
01:04:57.430 --> 01:04:57.440 align:start position:0%
i mean i know that we're uh just as a as
 
01:04:59.109 --> 01:04:59.119 align:start position:0%
an aside i know that we're referring to
 
01:05:01.029 --> 01:05:01.039 align:start position:0%
this as ground bait breaking in new
 
01:05:03.510 --> 01:05:03.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire is it groundbreaking
 
01:05:06.549 --> 01:05:06.559 align:start position:0%
nationally or
 
01:05:09.270 --> 01:05:09.280 align:start position:0%
i i mean i i just um i'm just looking
 
01:05:10.230 --> 01:05:10.240 align:start position:0%
for some
 
01:05:12.789 --> 01:05:12.799 align:start position:0%
sort of backup data if there is any
 
01:05:16.309 --> 01:05:16.319 align:start position:0%
north carolina is using that
 
01:05:18.870 --> 01:05:18.880 align:start position:0%
north carolina is okay but we don't have
 
01:05:22.150 --> 01:05:22.160 align:start position:0%
any current data on how it's going in
 
01:05:23.750 --> 01:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
north carolina
 
01:05:25.510 --> 01:05:25.520 align:start position:0%
um no
 
01:05:27.990 --> 01:05:28.000 align:start position:0%
not at the moment i'm wondering if um
 
01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:29.589 align:start position:0%
not at the moment i'm wondering if um
well

01:05:29.589 --> 01:05:29.599 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:05:31.829 --> 01:05:31.839 align:start position:0%
would we want to bring in anyone to for
 
01:05:34.870 --> 01:05:34.880 align:start position:0%
testimony on that rep um chairman lad
 
01:05:37.910 --> 01:05:37.920 align:start position:0%
well the the areas this is one of those
 
01:05:40.950 --> 01:05:40.960 align:start position:0%
categorical grant areas that we have in
 
01:05:43.670 --> 01:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
education and we have several others too
 
01:05:46.390 --> 01:05:46.400 align:start position:0%
as well you know building building aid
 
01:05:49.029 --> 01:05:49.039 align:start position:0%
as a category grant area a special
 
01:05:52.630 --> 01:05:52.640 align:start position:0%
education cat aid is a categorical grant
 
01:05:54.630 --> 01:05:54.640 align:start position:0%
area and there's also in the in the past
 
01:05:56.150 --> 01:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
been discussions whether we should do
 
01:05:58.390 --> 01:05:58.400 align:start position:0%
the same thing for transportation
 
01:05:58.400 --> 01:05:59.270 align:start position:0%
the same thing for transportation
um

01:05:59.270 --> 01:05:59.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:01.829 --> 01:06:01.839 align:start position:0%
those areas are above and beyond our
 
01:06:04.950 --> 01:06:04.960 align:start position:0%
adequacy funding formula and there are
 
01:06:07.829 --> 01:06:07.839 align:start position:0%
states though that have incorporated
 
01:06:10.549 --> 01:06:10.559 align:start position:0%
some of these aspects of these cat
 
01:06:13.270 --> 01:06:13.280 align:start position:0%
categorical grant funds into their
 
01:06:15.109 --> 01:06:15.119 align:start position:0%
funding formula
 
01:06:17.910 --> 01:06:17.920 align:start position:0%
so we in looking at that
 
01:06:20.230 --> 01:06:20.240 align:start position:0%
this is a complex issue when you start
 
01:06:22.230 --> 01:06:22.240 align:start position:0%
looking at other states because you have
 
01:06:24.549 --> 01:06:24.559 align:start position:0%
to look at their total funding
 
01:06:27.270 --> 01:06:27.280 align:start position:0%
formula for education and where the
 
01:06:29.750 --> 01:06:29.760 align:start position:0%
monies are parked uh there are some
 
01:06:31.349 --> 01:06:31.359 align:start position:0%
states that believe that for example
 
01:06:34.150 --> 01:06:34.160 align:start position:0%
school building aid is part of the basic
 
01:06:37.270 --> 01:06:37.280 align:start position:0%
requirement for an adequate education
 
01:06:39.829 --> 01:06:39.839 align:start position:0%
we've always had that outside
 
01:06:43.109 --> 01:06:43.119 align:start position:0%
seeing that back in 2008
 
01:06:44.630 --> 01:06:44.640 align:start position:0%
when we looked at it through the joint
 
01:06:46.230 --> 01:06:46.240 align:start position:0%
legislative oversight committee on
 
01:06:48.549 --> 01:06:48.559 align:start position:0%
costing and education
 
01:06:50.549 --> 01:06:50.559 align:start position:0%
building aid was being funded
 
01:06:53.430 --> 01:06:53.440 align:start position:0%
and so that by statute so there was no
 
01:06:55.670 --> 01:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
need to include it but other states have
 
01:06:59.990 --> 01:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
so as far as this this area of cad aid
 
01:07:02.309 --> 01:07:02.319 align:start position:0%
i think it'd be very difficult to
 
01:07:04.309 --> 01:07:04.319 align:start position:0%
mimic another state unless we looked at
 
01:07:07.029 --> 01:07:07.039 align:start position:0%
their whole structure of funding
 
01:07:07.039 --> 01:07:07.910 align:start position:0%
their whole structure of funding
and

01:07:07.910 --> 01:07:07.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:07:09.910 --> 01:07:09.920 align:start position:0%
i think we are in a groundbreaking area
 
01:07:11.910 --> 01:07:11.920 align:start position:0%
here i have not done any research on
 
01:07:14.309 --> 01:07:14.319 align:start position:0%
this so i want to be very clear on that
 
01:07:14.319 --> 01:07:15.270 align:start position:0%
this so i want to be very clear on that
um

01:07:15.270 --> 01:07:15.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:17.829 --> 01:07:17.839 align:start position:0%
and but i am very concerned
 
01:07:22.230 --> 01:07:22.240 align:start position:0%
a rep miler and rep cordelli um and then
 
01:07:24.069 --> 01:07:24.079 align:start position:0%
rep tanner
 
01:07:26.150 --> 01:07:26.160 align:start position:0%
yeah okay thank you and thank you mr
 
01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:27.990 align:start position:0%
yeah okay thank you and thank you mr
chair

01:07:27.990 --> 01:07:28.000 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:07:31.589 --> 01:07:31.599 align:start position:0%
i think there are several issues here
 
01:07:35.029 --> 01:07:35.039 align:start position:0%
one is is the policy question
 
01:07:37.670 --> 01:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
the issue is is this a good idea
 
01:07:39.829 --> 01:07:39.839 align:start position:0%
and i think that does reside with this
 
01:07:39.839 --> 01:07:41.109 align:start position:0%
and i think that does reside with this
committee

01:07:41.109 --> 01:07:41.119 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:07:43.510 --> 01:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
the second question then if this is a
 
01:07:45.190 --> 01:07:45.200 align:start position:0%
good idea
 
01:07:47.029 --> 01:07:47.039 align:start position:0%
how then might it work
 
01:07:48.710 --> 01:07:48.720 align:start position:0%
and this goes back to representative
 
01:07:50.069 --> 01:07:50.079 align:start position:0%
lay's comment
 
01:07:52.230 --> 01:07:52.240 align:start position:0%
of moving this then if we think it from
 
01:07:54.710 --> 01:07:54.720 align:start position:0%
a policy standpoint it's a good idea it
 
01:07:57.829 --> 01:07:57.839 align:start position:0%
then should go probably to commerce
 
01:08:00.230 --> 01:08:00.240 align:start position:0%
i do not believe that this should go
 
01:08:02.309 --> 01:08:02.319 align:start position:0%
directly to finance
 
01:08:05.670 --> 01:08:05.680 align:start position:0%
i mean finance has a lot to deal with
 
01:08:06.870 --> 01:08:06.880 align:start position:0%
and frankly
 
01:08:09.349 --> 01:08:09.359 align:start position:0%
they don't have the time
 
01:08:12.150 --> 01:08:12.160 align:start position:0%
to deal with the intricacies of this
 
01:08:14.150 --> 01:08:14.160 align:start position:0%
kind of a concept
 
01:08:15.910 --> 01:08:15.920 align:start position:0%
i would i would really caution this
 
01:08:15.920 --> 01:08:17.349 align:start position:0%
i would i would really caution this
committee

01:08:17.349 --> 01:08:17.359 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:08:20.470 --> 01:08:20.480 align:start position:0%
to move forward this in a real rapid way
 
01:08:20.480 --> 01:08:21.590 align:start position:0%
to move forward this in a real rapid way
because

01:08:21.590 --> 01:08:21.600 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:08:23.510 --> 01:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
as i said before i think we need to hear
 
01:08:24.709 --> 01:08:24.719 align:start position:0%
from those who are going to have to
 
01:08:26.870 --> 01:08:26.880 align:start position:0%
implement this out in the field and we
 
01:08:28.950 --> 01:08:28.960 align:start position:0%
just haven't heard that that voice yet
 
01:08:30.550 --> 01:08:30.560 align:start position:0%
to this morning
 
01:08:32.550 --> 01:08:32.560 align:start position:0%
so i think we should be cautious as we
 
01:08:36.229 --> 01:08:36.239 align:start position:0%
move forward on this thank you
 
01:08:40.950 --> 01:08:40.960 align:start position:0%
representative uh was tanner next or was
 
01:08:40.960 --> 01:08:42.309 align:start position:0%
representative uh was tanner next or was
cordelli

01:08:42.309 --> 01:08:42.319 align:start position:0%
cordelli
 
01:08:42.319 --> 01:08:44.229 align:start position:0%
cordelli
okay

01:08:44.229 --> 01:08:44.239 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:08:46.390 --> 01:08:46.400 align:start position:0%
now we have um rep luna
 
01:08:46.400 --> 01:08:47.910 align:start position:0%
now we have um rep luna
also

01:08:47.910 --> 01:08:47.920 align:start position:0%
also
 
01:08:52.550 --> 01:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
go ahead uh thank you mr chairman um i
 
01:08:54.789 --> 01:08:54.799 align:start position:0%
agree with some of the previous speakers
 
01:08:54.799 --> 01:08:57.189 align:start position:0%
agree with some of the previous speakers
that

01:08:57.189 --> 01:08:57.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:59.349 --> 01:08:59.359 align:start position:0%
commerce probably would be the best
 
01:09:01.910 --> 01:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
place to follow up on this
 
01:09:05.110 --> 01:09:05.120 align:start position:0%
they have more expertise in this area
 
01:09:06.550 --> 01:09:06.560 align:start position:0%
and can hold
 
01:09:07.990 --> 01:09:08.000 align:start position:0%
public hearings
 
01:09:09.110 --> 01:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
that would
 
01:09:11.749 --> 01:09:11.759 align:start position:0%
better get the information that's needed
 
01:09:14.550 --> 01:09:14.560 align:start position:0%
and i think that there's no reason to
 
01:09:17.990 --> 01:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
hold it further in this committee
 
01:09:21.590 --> 01:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:23.669 --> 01:09:23.679 align:start position:0%
uh represent tanner
 
01:09:27.430 --> 01:09:27.440 align:start position:0%
um i withdraw my question oh thank you
 
01:09:29.669 --> 01:09:29.679 align:start position:0%
in in the past we have had these bills
 
01:09:29.679 --> 01:09:30.390 align:start position:0%
in in the past we have had these bills
go

01:09:30.390 --> 01:09:30.400 align:start position:0%
go
 
01:09:32.070 --> 01:09:32.080 align:start position:0%
not not this type of bill but we've had
 
01:09:33.590 --> 01:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
bills go to health and human services
 
01:09:35.990 --> 01:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
we've had it go to children family law
 
01:09:38.950 --> 01:09:38.960 align:start position:0%
which are follow-up policies where
 
01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:39.990 align:start position:0%
which are follow-up policies where
issues

01:09:39.990 --> 01:09:40.000 align:start position:0%
issues
 
01:09:42.229 --> 01:09:42.239 align:start position:0%
dealing with things such as medicaid and
 
01:09:44.229 --> 01:09:44.239 align:start position:0%
schools can be better handled with the
 
01:09:46.789 --> 01:09:46.799 align:start position:0%
expertise that's on the other committees
 
01:09:49.590 --> 01:09:49.600 align:start position:0%
and i i also concur i believe the place
 
01:09:52.309 --> 01:09:52.319 align:start position:0%
this bill should go next is to commerce
 
01:09:54.310 --> 01:09:54.320 align:start position:0%
another policy committee and i like the
 
01:09:56.790 --> 01:09:56.800 align:start position:0%
idea there they can
 
01:09:58.550 --> 01:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
um better
 
01:10:02.229 --> 01:10:02.239 align:start position:0%
hear it and discuss it then i think we
 
01:10:02.239 --> 01:10:03.189 align:start position:0%
hear it and discuss it then i think we
are

01:10:03.189 --> 01:10:03.199 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:10:05.430 --> 01:10:05.440 align:start position:0%
we are not really oriented around some
 
01:10:06.950 --> 01:10:06.960 align:start position:0%
of the questions which we're hearing
 
01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:07.750 align:start position:0%
of the questions which we're hearing
here

01:10:07.750 --> 01:10:07.760 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:10:10.630 --> 01:10:10.640 align:start position:0%
um it it's at the beginning if this if
 
01:10:13.189 --> 01:10:13.199 align:start position:0%
i'd known about this at the very start
 
01:10:15.189 --> 01:10:15.199 align:start position:0%
of this i probably would have vacated
 
01:10:16.709 --> 01:10:16.719 align:start position:0%
this bill to them
 
01:10:18.630 --> 01:10:18.640 align:start position:0%
um where where
 
01:10:22.149 --> 01:10:22.159 align:start position:0%
it belongs um like we vacated one of our
 
01:10:23.910 --> 01:10:23.920 align:start position:0%
bills to finance where we were just
 
01:10:26.070 --> 01:10:26.080 align:start position:0%
dealing with changing a dollar amount it
 
01:10:27.910 --> 01:10:27.920 align:start position:0%
had nothing to do with policy this does
 
01:10:30.470 --> 01:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
have something to do with policy however
 
01:10:32.950 --> 01:10:32.960 align:start position:0%
i and we it's
 
01:10:35.110 --> 01:10:35.120 align:start position:0%
at this point in time we've heard it
 
01:10:37.189 --> 01:10:37.199 align:start position:0%
ourselves not from the public's
 
01:10:37.199 --> 01:10:38.310 align:start position:0%
ourselves not from the public's
perspective

01:10:38.310 --> 01:10:38.320 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
01:10:40.870 --> 01:10:40.880 align:start position:0%
but i i think the involvement the next
 
01:10:43.270 --> 01:10:43.280 align:start position:0%
step would be commerce uh
 
01:10:45.030 --> 01:10:45.040 align:start position:0%
can i um
 
01:10:47.830 --> 01:10:47.840 align:start position:0%
it's sorry chairman lad uh rep luno
 
01:10:49.590 --> 01:10:49.600 align:start position:0%
withdrew his hand
 
01:10:52.790 --> 01:10:52.800 align:start position:0%

an hour so
 
01:11:28.790 --> 01:11:28.800 align:start position:0%

01:11:32.390 --> 01:11:32.400 align:start position:0%
uh chairman hopson knows more than uh
 
01:11:34.550 --> 01:11:34.560 align:start position:0%

01:11:42.630 --> 01:11:42.640 align:start position:0%
it's coming by email should i send it to
 
01:11:44.630 --> 01:11:44.640 align:start position:0%
the whole committee or
 
01:11:46.870 --> 01:11:46.880 align:start position:0%
yes it came to my book in fact i've
 
01:11:48.870 --> 01:11:48.880 align:start position:0%
already sent that message to ols today
 
01:11:51.430 --> 01:11:51.440 align:start position:0%
that it be when it's done to be sent to
 
01:11:54.470 --> 01:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
everybody on the committee okay so you
 
01:11:56.470 --> 01:11:56.480 align:start position:0%
know this bill
 
01:11:58.470 --> 01:11:58.480 align:start position:0%
any bill that is
 
01:12:01.430 --> 01:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
sent to another committee uh as
 
01:12:03.510 --> 01:12:03.520 align:start position:0%
i recommended to the speaker earlier
 
01:12:05.510 --> 01:12:05.520 align:start position:0%
this year with one bill the speaker
 
01:12:08.310 --> 01:12:08.320 align:start position:0%
makes that decision and it will would go
 
01:12:10.709 --> 01:12:10.719 align:start position:0%
to that particular committee where it's
 
01:12:10.719 --> 01:12:11.990 align:start position:0%
to that particular committee where it's
better

01:12:11.990 --> 01:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
better
 
01:12:15.669 --> 01:12:15.679 align:start position:0%
going to have a better hearing um so
 
01:12:18.149 --> 01:12:18.159 align:start position:0%
we have about a half hour here
 
01:12:21.030 --> 01:12:21.040 align:start position:0%
we can and i want folks to have an
 
01:12:24.229 --> 01:12:24.239 align:start position:0%
opportunity to look at that amendment
 
01:12:25.350 --> 01:12:25.360 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:12:27.830 --> 01:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
note where those changes are i think the
 
01:12:30.550 --> 01:12:30.560 align:start position:0%
changes are basically the same page and
 
01:12:32.310 --> 01:12:32.320 align:start position:0%
line numbers that
 
01:12:34.950 --> 01:12:34.960 align:start position:0%
i sent those changes out to folks
 
01:12:36.950 --> 01:12:36.960 align:start position:0%
yesterday i believe
 
01:12:39.110 --> 01:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
it's all coming together here
 
01:12:40.470 --> 01:12:40.480 align:start position:0%
to look at
 
01:12:44.310 --> 01:12:44.320 align:start position:0%
um so at this point in time it is uh
 
01:12:46.790 --> 01:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
10 15
 
01:12:49.110 --> 01:12:49.120 align:start position:0%
or thereabouts um
 
01:12:51.110 --> 01:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
i'd like to uh
 
01:12:53.270 --> 01:12:53.280 align:start position:0%
you know recess this for about 15
 
01:12:56.070 --> 01:12:56.080 align:start position:0%
minutes where everybody can
 
01:12:58.550 --> 01:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
have you actually receive this on your
 
01:13:03.510 --> 01:13:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:03.520 --> 01:13:06.709 align:start position:0%
 
no

01:13:06.709 --> 01:13:06.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:09.110 --> 01:13:09.120 align:start position:0%

01:13:12.470 --> 01:13:12.480 align:start position:0%

oh you know what the uh
 
01:13:20.070 --> 01:13:20.080 align:start position:0%

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:52.229 align:start position:0%
i don't see anything in mind
okay

01:13:52.229 --> 01:13:52.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:53.990 --> 01:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
representative woodcock has his hand
 
01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:55.510 align:start position:0%
representative woodcock has his hand
raised

01:13:55.510 --> 01:13:55.520 align:start position:0%

01:13:58.229 --> 01:13:58.239 align:start position:0%
go go ahead represent woodcock
 
01:13:59.750 --> 01:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr representative just a quick
 
01:14:01.189 --> 01:14:01.199 align:start position:0%
question i'm sitting here listening to
 
01:14:02.790 --> 01:14:02.800 align:start position:0%
all this um
 
01:14:05.430 --> 01:14:05.440 align:start position:0%
it's relative so i'll ask it
 
01:14:07.030 --> 01:14:07.040 align:start position:0%
they said that they had a predictive
 
01:14:09.830 --> 01:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
model to help the the actuaries to
 
01:14:12.630 --> 01:14:12.640 align:start position:0%
develop this piece i wonder in that
 
01:14:15.590 --> 01:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
predictive model um was there any
 
01:14:18.790 --> 01:14:18.800 align:start position:0%
speculation on what a premium would be
 
01:14:20.229 --> 01:14:20.239 align:start position:0%
i'm just curious what a premium might
 
01:14:22.790 --> 01:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
cost a school a school or small school
 
01:14:25.270 --> 01:14:25.280 align:start position:0%
or school
 
01:14:30.950 --> 01:14:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:33.030 --> 01:14:33.040 align:start position:0%
we sort of got around to that question a
 
01:14:34.310 --> 01:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
little bit when we were talking about
 
01:14:35.830 --> 01:14:35.840 align:start position:0%
the levels of premiums the
 
01:14:35.840 --> 01:14:37.990 align:start position:0%
the levels of premiums the
percentage-wise

01:14:37.990 --> 01:14:38.000 align:start position:0%
percentage-wise
 
01:14:40.390 --> 01:14:40.400 align:start position:0%
of what it would assume or take the cost
 
01:14:42.470 --> 01:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
of those unpredicted costs
 
01:14:42.480 --> 01:14:43.750 align:start position:0%
of those unpredicted costs
um

01:14:43.750 --> 01:14:43.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:46.630 --> 01:14:46.640 align:start position:0%
but we never did discuss the you know
 
01:14:48.149 --> 01:14:48.159 align:start position:0%
what the
 
01:14:51.510 --> 01:14:51.520 align:start position:0%
average premium might be
 
01:14:53.990 --> 01:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
yeah i don't think that's capable we're
 
01:14:56.390 --> 01:14:56.400 align:start position:0%
capable of doing that seeing that the
 
01:14:58.630 --> 01:14:58.640 align:start position:0%
size of the association would be a a
 
01:15:00.630 --> 01:15:00.640 align:start position:0%
definite impactor
 
01:15:03.910 --> 01:15:03.920 align:start position:0%
um the you know when we try to get you
 
01:15:06.390 --> 01:15:06.400 align:start position:0%
know a sick lead bank within a school
 
01:15:09.110 --> 01:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
district the larger number of
 
01:15:11.430 --> 01:15:11.440 align:start position:0%
teachers in that district
 
01:15:14.310 --> 01:15:14.320 align:start position:0%
really really do support
 
01:15:15.910 --> 01:15:15.920 align:start position:0%
costs in the amount that have to be
 
01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:18.070 align:start position:0%
costs in the amount that have to be
contributed

01:15:18.070 --> 01:15:18.080 align:start position:0%
contributed
 
01:15:20.709 --> 01:15:20.719 align:start position:0%
and that also goes when we're looking at
 
01:15:23.430 --> 01:15:23.440 align:start position:0%
counties trying to get together and find
 
01:15:26.390 --> 01:15:26.400 align:start position:0%
a cheaper way for utilities when you
 
01:15:29.270 --> 01:15:29.280 align:start position:0%
join as a as a total group you can knock
 
01:15:31.189 --> 01:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
down your costs first only two or three
 
01:15:33.030 --> 01:15:33.040 align:start position:0%
getting together so
 
01:15:35.030 --> 01:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
i i don't think we have that information
 
01:15:37.110 --> 01:15:37.120 align:start position:0%
represented woodcock um
 
01:15:38.390 --> 01:15:38.400 align:start position:0%
that's right thank you thank you
 
01:15:40.709 --> 01:15:40.719 align:start position:0%
residents here appreciate it yeah
 
01:15:44.070 --> 01:15:44.080 align:start position:0%
mr mr chairman i i just did receive
 
01:15:44.080 --> 01:15:45.430 align:start position:0%
mr mr chairman i i just did receive
information

01:15:45.430 --> 01:15:45.440 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:15:47.910 --> 01:15:47.920 align:start position:0%
uh from jane bergeron
 
01:15:51.430 --> 01:15:51.440 align:start position:0%
who is the uh executive director of the
 
01:15:54.149 --> 01:15:54.159 align:start position:0%
special ed coordinators and she has said
 
01:15:56.790 --> 01:15:56.800 align:start position:0%
that there has been no conversation
 
01:15:58.630 --> 01:15:58.640 align:start position:0%
with the coordinators
 
01:16:00.470 --> 01:16:00.480 align:start position:0%
coming from the they meet with the
 
01:16:04.390 --> 01:16:04.400 align:start position:0%
department coordinator on a weekly basis
 
01:16:06.550 --> 01:16:06.560 align:start position:0%
and she said this is all new to them
 
01:16:07.990 --> 01:16:08.000 align:start position:0%
that they've not seen this at all
 
01:16:09.990 --> 01:16:10.000 align:start position:0%
they've not looked at the amendment
 
01:16:12.470 --> 01:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
and there is some concern about the
 
01:16:12.480 --> 01:16:13.750 align:start position:0%
and there is some concern about the
impact

01:16:13.750 --> 01:16:13.760 align:start position:0%
impact
 
01:16:15.990 --> 01:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
that this could have without them having
 
01:16:18.310 --> 01:16:18.320 align:start position:0%
a chance to really look and study this
 
01:16:20.709 --> 01:16:20.719 align:start position:0%
uh in a definitive kind of a way i
 
01:16:21.990 --> 01:16:22.000 align:start position:0%
thought the committee should know that
 
01:16:24.470 --> 01:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you
 
01:16:26.310 --> 01:16:26.320 align:start position:0%
oh mr chairman
 
01:16:29.350 --> 01:16:29.360 align:start position:0%
has her hand raised
 
01:16:32.950 --> 01:16:32.960 align:start position:0%
if i may mr chair represent
 
01:16:34.390 --> 01:16:34.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
01:16:34.400 --> 01:16:35.110 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
so

01:16:35.110 --> 01:16:35.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:16:38.470 --> 01:16:38.480 align:start position:0%
it is it is un unknowable right now to
 
01:16:40.229 --> 01:16:40.239 align:start position:0%
price the premiums because there are too
 
01:16:41.510 --> 01:16:41.520 align:start position:0%
many variables and too many
 
01:16:43.750 --> 01:16:43.760 align:start position:0%
uncertainties there is absolutely no way
 
01:16:45.590 --> 01:16:45.600 align:start position:0%
that we could have any sort of useful
 
01:16:48.790 --> 01:16:48.800 align:start position:0%
premium what we do know is that there
 
01:16:50.550 --> 01:16:50.560 align:start position:0%
are already districts that are doing
 
01:16:52.870 --> 01:16:52.880 align:start position:0%
this in the least efficient way possible
 
01:16:55.350 --> 01:16:55.360 align:start position:0%
these rainy day funds are the most
 
01:16:57.750 --> 01:16:57.760 align:start position:0%
expensive way to do this they have the
 
01:17:00.229 --> 01:17:00.239 align:start position:0%
highest opportunity cost yet it is still
 
01:17:02.229 --> 01:17:02.239 align:start position:0%
valuable enough for enough of these
 
01:17:04.229 --> 01:17:04.239 align:start position:0%
these districts that they are doing this
 
01:17:06.390 --> 01:17:06.400 align:start position:0%
in the most inefficient way possible
 
01:17:09.430 --> 01:17:09.440 align:start position:0%
this is something that that i think
 
01:17:11.510 --> 01:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
it will not impact the day-to-day
 
01:17:13.270 --> 01:17:13.280 align:start position:0%
operations this is something where
 
01:17:15.030 --> 01:17:15.040 align:start position:0%
instead of having an inefficient rainy
 
01:17:16.390 --> 01:17:16.400 align:start position:0%
day fund we can have something more
 
01:17:18.470 --> 01:17:18.480 align:start position:0%
sophisticated and provides a better
 
01:17:21.110 --> 01:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
value so i think i think that this is a
 
01:17:23.030 --> 01:17:23.040 align:start position:0%
phenomenal tool what i did was price
 
01:17:25.270 --> 01:17:25.280 align:start position:0%
risk that is what i did on the options
 
01:17:27.750 --> 01:17:27.760 align:start position:0%
floor and i am so excited about this
 
01:17:29.270 --> 01:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
opportunity and i can't wait to see what
 
01:17:31.110 --> 01:17:31.120 align:start position:0%
commerce has to say because they know
 
01:17:33.110 --> 01:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
these details better than we do
 
01:17:34.709 --> 01:17:34.719 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:17:36.070 --> 01:17:36.080 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:17:39.669 --> 01:17:39.679 align:start position:0%
uh i'm going to take a break here for
 
01:17:39.679 --> 01:17:40.870 align:start position:0%
uh i'm going to take a break here for
uh

01:17:40.870 --> 01:17:40.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:17:44.070 --> 01:17:44.080 align:start position:0%
15 or 20 minutes here to look at that
 
01:17:46.790 --> 01:17:46.800 align:start position:0%
amendment read it over i haven't had a
 
01:17:48.390 --> 01:17:48.400 align:start position:0%
chance to look it over and i would
 
01:17:51.430 --> 01:17:51.440 align:start position:0%
advise everybody to take this recess
 
01:17:53.189 --> 01:17:53.199 align:start position:0%
get something out of your refrigerator
 
01:17:55.030 --> 01:17:55.040 align:start position:0%
get a cup of coffee look it over please
 
01:17:58.229 --> 01:17:58.239 align:start position:0%
and we'll come back in about 20 minutes
 
01:18:00.709 --> 01:18:00.719 align:start position:0%
so it's right now it's it's 10 20 we'll
 
01:18:04.550 --> 01:18:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:07.189 --> 01:18:07.199 align:start position:0%
so everybody okay with that
 
01:18:08.470 --> 01:18:08.480 align:start position:0%

take your mid-morning break
 
01:19:44.229 --> 01:19:44.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:44.239 --> 01:20:58.709 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:20:58.709 --> 01:20:58.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:58.719 --> 01:22:14.470 align:start position:0%
 
this

01:22:14.470 --> 01:22:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:14.480 --> 01:22:32.550 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:22:32.550 --> 01:22:32.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:32.560 --> 01:23:10.709 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:23:10.709 --> 01:23:10.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:10.719 --> 01:23:28.149 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:23:28.159 --> 01:24:37.110 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:24:37.110 --> 01:24:37.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:37.120 --> 01:27:09.030 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:27:09.040 --> 01:27:40.550 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:27:40.560 --> 01:28:49.910 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:28:49.910 --> 01:28:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:49.920 --> 01:29:17.669 align:start position:0%

thing working now if i can figure out
 
01:39:09.750 --> 01:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
how to mute myself again
 
01:39:12.629 --> 01:39:12.639 align:start position:0%
i think sometimes uh when you have two
 
01:39:12.639 --> 01:39:15.189 align:start position:0%
i think sometimes uh when you have two
devices

01:39:15.189 --> 01:39:15.199 align:start position:0%
devices
 
01:39:17.510 --> 01:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
on your you know within each other if
 
01:39:19.830 --> 01:39:19.840 align:start position:0%
you're not muted it'll when they're both
 
01:39:21.990 --> 01:39:22.000 align:start position:0%
yeah i i knew that was the problem
 
01:39:24.229 --> 01:39:24.239 align:start position:0%
that's but i couldn't figure out how to
 
01:39:27.030 --> 01:39:27.040 align:start position:0%
shut this one off because i'm not using
 
01:39:29.910 --> 01:39:29.920 align:start position:0%
it it's 10 40 and it's time for us to
 
01:39:29.920 --> 01:39:31.990 align:start position:0%
it it's 10 40 and it's time for us to
continue

01:39:31.990 --> 01:39:32.000 align:start position:0%
continue
 
01:39:33.669 --> 01:39:33.679 align:start position:0%
i hope everybody had a chance to get a
 
01:39:36.229 --> 01:39:36.239 align:start position:0%
cup of coffee or a glass of water or
 
01:39:44.149 --> 01:39:44.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:44.159 --> 01:39:45.030 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:39:45.030 --> 01:39:45.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:39:48.550 --> 01:39:48.560 align:start position:0%
okay so here we are um dealing with the
 
01:39:48.560 --> 01:39:50.229 align:start position:0%
okay so here we are um dealing with the
613

01:39:50.229 --> 01:39:50.239 align:start position:0%
613
 
01:39:52.390 --> 01:39:52.400 align:start position:0%
and we've got quite a discussion here
 
01:39:55.510 --> 01:39:55.520 align:start position:0%
and on the amending language uh i i
 
01:39:57.830 --> 01:39:57.840 align:start position:0%
think it's now time we're
 
01:39:59.350 --> 01:39:59.360 align:start position:0%
because we do have the other bill to
 
01:40:00.870 --> 01:40:00.880 align:start position:0%
this morning as well
 
01:40:04.470 --> 01:40:04.480 align:start position:0%
to you know to uh move forward
 
01:40:07.430 --> 01:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
uh and uh get emotion on the floor so
 
01:40:08.950 --> 01:40:08.960 align:start position:0%
i'm going to
 
01:40:11.430 --> 01:40:11.440 align:start position:0%

as ought to pass as amended
 
01:40:25.189 --> 01:40:25.199 align:start position:0%
is there a second
 
01:40:26.550 --> 01:40:26.560 align:start position:0%
the motion would be to adopt the
 
01:40:28.550 --> 01:40:28.560 align:start position:0%
amendment oh
 
01:40:30.390 --> 01:40:30.400 align:start position:0%

01:40:32.229 --> 01:40:32.239 align:start position:0%
oh sorry i knew
 
01:40:35.830 --> 01:40:35.840 align:start position:0%
so i moved to adopt the amendment um 356
 
01:40:35.840 --> 01:40:37.910 align:start position:0%
so i moved to adopt the amendment um 356
each

01:40:37.910 --> 01:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
each
 
01:40:39.830 --> 01:40:39.840 align:start position:0%
at the correct way to state that
 
01:40:41.910 --> 01:40:41.920 align:start position:0%
so there was a second from was that you
 
01:40:44.790 --> 01:40:44.800 align:start position:0%
represent allard yes it was okay thank
 
01:40:46.629 --> 01:40:46.639 align:start position:0%

01:40:49.990 --> 01:40:50.000 align:start position:0%
okay so we have a motion on the floor to
 
01:40:54.790 --> 01:40:54.800 align:start position:0%
approve the amendment for 613
 
01:40:54.800 --> 01:40:57.830 align:start position:0%
approve the amendment for 613
discussion

01:40:57.830 --> 01:40:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:00.229 --> 01:41:00.239 align:start position:0%
represent myler
 
01:41:03.590 --> 01:41:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:05.590 --> 01:41:05.600 align:start position:0%
this is unfortunate that we have this at
 
01:41:08.790 --> 01:41:08.800 align:start position:0%
this point in time uh this is uh
 
01:41:10.870 --> 01:41:10.880 align:start position:0%
an amendment that has come in at the
 
01:41:13.109 --> 01:41:13.119 align:start position:0%
11th hour
 
01:41:15.750 --> 01:41:15.760 align:start position:0%
it has significant implications
 
01:41:16.830 --> 01:41:16.840 align:start position:0%
uh for
 
01:41:19.990 --> 01:41:20.000 align:start position:0%
uh special education funding and how we
 
01:41:21.350 --> 01:41:21.360 align:start position:0%
do it
 
01:41:23.510 --> 01:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
uh the concept
 
01:41:25.669 --> 01:41:25.679 align:start position:0%
there may soon be some some relevance
 
01:41:28.149 --> 01:41:28.159 align:start position:0%
for that concept but we clearly have not
 
01:41:30.229 --> 01:41:30.239 align:start position:0%
had an opportunity
 
01:41:33.750 --> 01:41:33.760 align:start position:0%
to really ferret all the issues out here
 
01:41:35.350 --> 01:41:35.360 align:start position:0%
and i think it's premature and
 
01:41:38.149 --> 01:41:38.159 align:start position:0%
unfortunate because uh
 
01:41:40.310 --> 01:41:40.320 align:start position:0%
although i may agree with the concept
 
01:41:41.350 --> 01:41:41.360 align:start position:0%
once we
 
01:41:43.109 --> 01:41:43.119 align:start position:0%
hear all of it
 
01:41:44.950 --> 01:41:44.960 align:start position:0%
i can't vote for this at this point in
 
01:41:47.030 --> 01:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
time unfortunately because
 
01:41:49.910 --> 01:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
of uh it being rushed through
 
01:41:51.990 --> 01:41:52.000 align:start position:0%
and i don't think it's a i don't think
 
01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:52.950 align:start position:0%
and i don't think it's a i don't think
it's

01:41:52.950 --> 01:41:52.960 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:41:55.510 --> 01:41:55.520 align:start position:0%
i don't think it's appropriate
 
01:41:57.430 --> 01:41:57.440 align:start position:0%
for us to move this without
 
01:41:59.750 --> 01:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
understanding the full impact of the
 
01:42:01.350 --> 01:42:01.360 align:start position:0%
policy here
 
01:42:03.109 --> 01:42:03.119 align:start position:0%
we can have somebody else look at the
 
01:42:05.910 --> 01:42:05.920 align:start position:0%
issue of risk fuel and insurance and all
 
01:42:07.910 --> 01:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
that other stuff this is not going to go
 
01:42:09.990 --> 01:42:10.000 align:start position:0%
to finance this is a second bill that's
 
01:42:12.310 --> 01:42:12.320 align:start position:0%
going to probably go to commerce
 
01:42:14.550 --> 01:42:14.560 align:start position:0%
but i think we need to have a full
 
01:42:14.560 --> 01:42:16.550 align:start position:0%
but i think we need to have a full
disclosure

01:42:16.550 --> 01:42:16.560 align:start position:0%

funding
 
01:42:22.870 --> 01:42:22.880 align:start position:0%
i would really encourage you not to vote
 
01:42:25.270 --> 01:42:25.280 align:start position:0%
this but we should retain this bill
 
01:42:28.470 --> 01:42:28.480 align:start position:0%
and have more time to look at it
 
01:42:31.430 --> 01:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
frustrated thank you mister
 
01:42:35.590 --> 01:42:35.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:38.550 --> 01:42:38.560 align:start position:0%
uh uh representative a late land you
 
01:42:40.470 --> 01:42:40.480 align:start position:0%
didn't have it you made the motion so
 
01:42:43.109 --> 01:42:43.119 align:start position:0%
you should have an opportunity to
 
01:42:45.030 --> 01:42:45.040 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion
 
01:42:46.790 --> 01:42:46.800 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair
 
01:42:49.270 --> 01:42:49.280 align:start position:0%
i recognize that this amendment did come
 
01:42:52.390 --> 01:42:52.400 align:start position:0%
in um to us at this late date however i
 
01:42:54.229 --> 01:42:54.239 align:start position:0%
believe that this policy is already
 
01:42:56.470 --> 01:42:56.480 align:start position:0%
implemented currently we have talent we
 
01:42:58.390 --> 01:42:58.400 align:start position:0%
have districts across the state that are
 
01:43:00.550 --> 01:43:00.560 align:start position:0%
in self-insuring for the same exact
 
01:43:03.510 --> 01:43:03.520 align:start position:0%
exact risk the policy already is to
 
01:43:05.109 --> 01:43:05.119 align:start position:0%
address these risks through an insurance
 
01:43:07.350 --> 01:43:07.360 align:start position:0%
system however it's the expensive
 
01:43:09.990 --> 01:43:10.000 align:start position:0%
and high opportunity cost self-insurance
 
01:43:12.629 --> 01:43:12.639 align:start position:0%
policy at this point this allows the
 
01:43:15.030 --> 01:43:15.040 align:start position:0%
towns an opportunity to find a more
 
01:43:17.109 --> 01:43:17.119 align:start position:0%
cost-effective method in order to
 
01:43:18.629 --> 01:43:18.639 align:start position:0%
address these risks that they as a
 
01:43:21.430 --> 01:43:21.440 align:start position:0%
policy already addressed i believe that
 
01:43:23.669 --> 01:43:23.679 align:start position:0%
this this does fit with the current
 
01:43:25.830 --> 01:43:25.840 align:start position:0%
policy and the current implementation
 
01:43:28.229 --> 01:43:28.239 align:start position:0%
and it's simply a matter of financial
 
01:43:29.830 --> 01:43:29.840 align:start position:0%
management and i believe that moving
 
01:43:31.750 --> 01:43:31.760 align:start position:0%
this to commerce is the correct move at
 
01:43:33.990 --> 01:43:34.000 align:start position:0%
this point thank you
 
01:43:37.189 --> 01:43:37.199 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh representative uh
 
01:43:43.270 --> 01:43:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:45.910 --> 01:43:45.920 align:start position:0%
representative mullen thank you mr chair
 
01:43:45.920 --> 01:43:46.870 align:start position:0%
representative mullen thank you mr chair
um

01:43:46.870 --> 01:43:46.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:50.629 --> 01:43:50.639 align:start position:0%
with all due respect my uh my issue here
 
01:43:53.910 --> 01:43:53.920 align:start position:0%
is not necessarily with the policy
 
01:43:57.030 --> 01:43:57.040 align:start position:0%
though i would say that uh i don't feel
 
01:43:59.830 --> 01:43:59.840 align:start position:0%
that i've had an adequate opportunity to
 
01:44:02.149 --> 01:44:02.159 align:start position:0%
hear information to even know whether or
 
01:44:04.870 --> 01:44:04.880 align:start position:0%
not i agree with the policy or disagree
 
01:44:08.629 --> 01:44:08.639 align:start position:0%
with the policy but my concern
 
01:44:11.669 --> 01:44:11.679 align:start position:0%
and it is a grave concern is with the
 
01:44:14.470 --> 01:44:14.480 align:start position:0%
process that has been used uh this
 
01:44:17.350 --> 01:44:17.360 align:start position:0%
morning because i feel a responsibility
 
01:44:19.430 --> 01:44:19.440 align:start position:0%
to every one of my constituents to be
 
01:44:22.870 --> 01:44:22.880 align:start position:0%
able to go back and explain to them what
 
01:44:25.189 --> 01:44:25.199 align:start position:0%
has happened here this morning and
 
01:44:27.830 --> 01:44:27.840 align:start position:0%
without an adequate opportunity to have
 
01:44:30.149 --> 01:44:30.159 align:start position:0%
a hearing on the amendment and an
 
01:44:32.629 --> 01:44:32.639 align:start position:0%
opportunity to be able to discuss this
 
01:44:35.109 --> 01:44:35.119 align:start position:0%
and ask questions further i don't feel
 
01:44:37.590 --> 01:44:37.600 align:start position:0%
that i'm in a position where i could
 
01:44:39.750 --> 01:44:39.760 align:start position:0%
even uh
 
01:44:41.910 --> 01:44:41.920 align:start position:0%
venture a guess as to whether or not i
 
01:44:44.550 --> 01:44:44.560 align:start position:0%
agree with the policy or not and
 
01:44:47.270 --> 01:44:47.280 align:start position:0%
uh as i said i have grave concerns about
 
01:44:49.430 --> 01:44:49.440 align:start position:0%
that thank you
 
01:44:56.149 --> 01:44:56.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:56.159 --> 01:44:58.070 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:44:58.070 --> 01:44:58.080 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:44:59.430 --> 01:44:59.440 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure
 
01:45:01.510 --> 01:45:01.520 align:start position:0%
if we had a public hearing and we
 
01:45:03.189 --> 01:45:03.199 align:start position:0%
discussed all this and everything if
 
01:45:04.950 --> 01:45:04.960 align:start position:0%
we'd be any farther along than we are
 
01:45:04.960 --> 01:45:06.229 align:start position:0%
we'd be any farther along than we are
now

01:45:06.229 --> 01:45:06.239 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:45:08.390 --> 01:45:08.400 align:start position:0%
because most of us
 
01:45:10.870 --> 01:45:10.880 align:start position:0%
don't actually understand all this stuff
 
01:45:12.870 --> 01:45:12.880 align:start position:0%
in great detail
 
01:45:15.189 --> 01:45:15.199 align:start position:0%
and it seems to me that the policy
 
01:45:16.870 --> 01:45:16.880 align:start position:0%
basically is
 
01:45:21.189 --> 01:45:21.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:23.510 --> 01:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
an insurance
 
01:45:23.520 --> 01:45:24.790 align:start position:0%
an insurance
form

01:45:24.790 --> 01:45:24.800 align:start position:0%
form
 
01:45:27.030 --> 01:45:27.040 align:start position:0%
that they can enter into
 
01:45:29.109 --> 01:45:29.119 align:start position:0%
and all those details and all those
 
01:45:30.950 --> 01:45:30.960 align:start position:0%
things that need to be gone through and
 
01:45:33.030 --> 01:45:33.040 align:start position:0%
looked at and all that stuff should be
 
01:45:35.030 --> 01:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
done with commerce people who really
 
01:45:37.030 --> 01:45:37.040 align:start position:0%
know what they're doing and not
 
01:45:41.189 --> 01:45:41.199 align:start position:0%
education and our job is to say
 
01:45:44.790 --> 01:45:44.800 align:start position:0%
yes this is needed here take it and
 
01:45:47.350 --> 01:45:47.360 align:start position:0%
do whatever with it please
 
01:45:52.390 --> 01:45:52.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:54.709 --> 01:45:54.719 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh
 
01:45:56.390 --> 01:45:56.400 align:start position:0%
yeah i i'm
 
01:45:58.790 --> 01:45:58.800 align:start position:0%
disappointed here i suppose
 
01:46:01.669 --> 01:46:01.679 align:start position:0%
i do believe that this needs
 
01:46:04.709 --> 01:46:04.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:06.950 --> 01:46:06.960 align:start position:0%
the implementation and the implications
 
01:46:08.629 --> 01:46:08.639 align:start position:0%
of this
 
01:46:11.590 --> 01:46:11.600 align:start position:0%
we don't know at this point
 
01:46:14.229 --> 01:46:14.239 align:start position:0%
we have not heard from superintendents
 
01:46:15.669 --> 01:46:15.679 align:start position:0%
we have not heard from any of the
 
01:46:17.750 --> 01:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
financial managers within the school
 
01:46:20.310 --> 01:46:20.320 align:start position:0%
districts themselves we have not heard a
 
01:46:25.430 --> 01:46:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:27.590 --> 01:46:27.600 align:start position:0%
that would be directly affected those
 
01:46:30.390 --> 01:46:30.400 align:start position:0%
requiring this aid um and benefiting
 
01:46:32.070 --> 01:46:32.080 align:start position:0%
from this sort of aid
 
01:46:34.310 --> 01:46:34.320 align:start position:0%
there may be no impact on them that that
 
01:46:37.109 --> 01:46:37.119 align:start position:0%
may be the case but we do not know that
 
01:46:37.119 --> 01:46:38.070 align:start position:0%
may be the case but we do not know that
yet

01:46:38.070 --> 01:46:38.080 align:start position:0%
yet
 
01:46:40.870 --> 01:46:40.880 align:start position:0%
and while i recognize that this is a
 
01:46:43.830 --> 01:46:43.840 align:start position:0%
financial instrument
 
01:46:46.149 --> 01:46:46.159 align:start position:0%
financial instruments
 
01:46:47.669 --> 01:46:47.679 align:start position:0%
almost always
 
01:46:51.030 --> 01:46:51.040 align:start position:0%
carry potential policy and social
 
01:46:53.590 --> 01:46:53.600 align:start position:0%
implications they do not exist in a
 
01:46:53.600 --> 01:46:55.109 align:start position:0%
implications they do not exist in a
vacuum

01:46:55.109 --> 01:46:55.119 align:start position:0%
vacuum
 
01:46:57.350 --> 01:46:57.360 align:start position:0%
they carry policy and social
 
01:47:00.070 --> 01:47:00.080 align:start position:0%
implications and that is the job of this
 
01:47:00.080 --> 01:47:01.189 align:start position:0%
implications and that is the job of this
committee

01:47:01.189 --> 01:47:01.199 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:47:03.910 --> 01:47:03.920 align:start position:0%
is to examine and
 
01:47:06.550 --> 01:47:06.560 align:start position:0%
and understand what those implications
 
01:47:09.990 --> 01:47:10.000 align:start position:0%
possibly could be before we move this
 
01:47:12.070 --> 01:47:12.080 align:start position:0%
forward into
 
01:47:14.629 --> 01:47:14.639 align:start position:0%
the the into commerce where the
 
01:47:16.550 --> 01:47:16.560 align:start position:0%
financial pieces themselves can be
 
01:47:18.310 --> 01:47:18.320 align:start position:0%
looked at so
 
01:47:20.550 --> 01:47:20.560 align:start position:0%
i i feel like this is a derogation of
 
01:47:23.669 --> 01:47:23.679 align:start position:0%
duty or dereliction of duty on the part
 
01:47:26.310 --> 01:47:26.320 align:start position:0%
of this committee and i i find that that
 
01:47:27.830 --> 01:47:27.840 align:start position:0%
somewhat sad
 
01:47:30.629 --> 01:47:30.639 align:start position:0%
that we would do that so i will
 
01:47:33.350 --> 01:47:33.360 align:start position:0%
reluctantly vote against the amendment
 
01:47:35.510 --> 01:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
and uh vote against the bill because i
 
01:47:37.030 --> 01:47:37.040 align:start position:0%
think it should be retained and we
 
01:47:40.229 --> 01:47:40.239 align:start position:0%
should be examining it um more closely i
 
01:47:42.790 --> 01:47:42.800 align:start position:0%
don't see what the immediate rush is on
 
01:47:42.800 --> 01:47:43.669 align:start position:0%
don't see what the immediate rush is on
this

01:47:43.669 --> 01:47:43.679 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:47:46.550 --> 01:47:46.560 align:start position:0%
um we could take the time we should take
 
01:47:48.629 --> 01:47:48.639 align:start position:0%
the time that's the job of this
 
01:47:51.270 --> 01:47:51.280 align:start position:0%
committee that's the job of education
 
01:47:53.910 --> 01:47:53.920 align:start position:0%
and educators thank you
 
01:47:59.910 --> 01:47:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:01.830 --> 01:48:01.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:48:05.270 --> 01:48:05.280 align:start position:0%
not passing this bill or an amendment
 
01:48:07.430 --> 01:48:07.440 align:start position:0%
faculty will kill the bill for this year
 
01:48:09.910 --> 01:48:09.920 align:start position:0%
which something we don't want to do
 
01:48:13.669 --> 01:48:13.679 align:start position:0%
and as for amendments for hearings
 
01:48:13.679 --> 01:48:14.629 align:start position:0%
and as for amendments for hearings
when

01:48:14.629 --> 01:48:14.639 align:start position:0%
when
 
01:48:16.870 --> 01:48:16.880 align:start position:0%
have we ever had a hearing on an
 
01:48:19.109 --> 01:48:19.119 align:start position:0%
amendment when we're
 
01:48:21.910 --> 01:48:21.920 align:start position:0%
when we're executing a bill that's
 
01:48:24.870 --> 01:48:24.880 align:start position:0%
we don't do that we have amendments for
 
01:48:27.270 --> 01:48:27.280 align:start position:0%
bills when we do exact and that's always
 
01:48:29.750 --> 01:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
happened so
 
01:48:32.149 --> 01:48:32.159 align:start position:0%
this is something we need to do if if
 
01:48:35.270 --> 01:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
this was going nowhere but to pass yeah
 
01:48:37.030 --> 01:48:37.040 align:start position:0%
then i wouldn't be for it but it's going
 
01:48:38.790 --> 01:48:38.800 align:start position:0%
to a second and maybe even a third
 
01:48:40.790 --> 01:48:40.800 align:start position:0%
committee where all this stuff can be
 
01:48:42.790 --> 01:48:42.800 align:start position:0%
hashed out so
 
01:48:45.590 --> 01:48:45.600 align:start position:0%
let's move on thank you
 
01:48:47.109 --> 01:48:47.119 align:start position:0%
representative shaw did you have your
 
01:48:54.550 --> 01:48:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:57.830 --> 01:48:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:57.840 --> 01:48:58.709 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:48:58.709 --> 01:48:58.719 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:49:00.870 --> 01:49:00.880 align:start position:0%
i did sorry
 
01:49:00.880 --> 01:49:02.470 align:start position:0%
i did sorry
um

01:49:02.470 --> 01:49:02.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:06.149 --> 01:49:06.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:08.790 --> 01:49:08.800 align:start position:0%
i just i embrace this idea there's no
 
01:49:10.870 --> 01:49:10.880 align:start position:0%
doubt about it we this this could
 
01:49:13.669 --> 01:49:13.679 align:start position:0%
probably be a very very significant
 
01:49:13.679 --> 01:49:14.629 align:start position:0%
probably be a very very significant
change

01:49:14.629 --> 01:49:14.639 align:start position:0%
change
 
01:49:17.270 --> 01:49:17.280 align:start position:0%
uh to our districts and and to the the
 
01:49:20.390 --> 01:49:20.400 align:start position:0%
funding of of the catastrophic aid and
 
01:49:20.400 --> 01:49:21.350 align:start position:0%
funding of of the catastrophic aid and
i

01:49:21.350 --> 01:49:21.360 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:49:23.109 --> 01:49:23.119 align:start position:0%
but i agree
 
01:49:25.189 --> 01:49:25.199 align:start position:0%
completely with uh
 
01:49:28.229 --> 01:49:28.239 align:start position:0%
uh representative lay
 
01:49:32.550 --> 01:49:32.560 align:start position:0%
we this bill is screaming retention
 
01:49:35.109 --> 01:49:35.119 align:start position:0%
if you want to do something right and
 
01:49:38.149 --> 01:49:38.159 align:start position:0%
have a grip on it and really understand
 
01:49:41.350 --> 01:49:41.360 align:start position:0%
what's coming out of our committee which
 
01:49:43.350 --> 01:49:43.360 align:start position:0%
is the way we've always done things in
 
01:49:45.590 --> 01:49:45.600 align:start position:0%
the past is to really
 
01:49:48.310 --> 01:49:48.320 align:start position:0%
study it and retain it and then
 
01:49:50.709 --> 01:49:50.719 align:start position:0%
after we understand it and we get the
 
01:49:50.719 --> 01:49:51.910 align:start position:0%
after we understand it and we get the
impact

01:49:51.910 --> 01:49:51.920 align:start position:0%
impact
 
01:49:54.070 --> 01:49:54.080 align:start position:0%
statements from the superintendents and
 
01:49:56.550 --> 01:49:56.560 align:start position:0%
from everyone that's going to be dealing
 
01:49:57.590 --> 01:49:57.600 align:start position:0%
with this
 
01:49:57.600 --> 01:49:58.790 align:start position:0%
with this
uh

01:49:58.790 --> 01:49:58.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:50:01.590 --> 01:50:01.600 align:start position:0%
i i have no idea what my city would
 
01:50:03.830 --> 01:50:03.840 align:start position:0%
think of something like this and and i
 
01:50:05.430 --> 01:50:05.440 align:start position:0%
don't feel right
 
01:50:07.270 --> 01:50:07.280 align:start position:0%
passing something that i don't even know
 
01:50:09.669 --> 01:50:09.679 align:start position:0%
what my city would want to do with it or
 
01:50:12.470 --> 01:50:12.480 align:start position:0%
my superintendent so i think that
 
01:50:15.510 --> 01:50:15.520 align:start position:0%
retention would be a much better idea
 
01:50:19.669 --> 01:50:19.679 align:start position:0%
and so what if it goes to next year
 
01:50:21.910 --> 01:50:21.920 align:start position:0%
what's one year what difference does it
 
01:50:24.790 --> 01:50:24.800 align:start position:0%
make if it's going to be beneficial for
 
01:50:27.750 --> 01:50:27.760 align:start position:0%
30 years down the road then one year is
 
01:50:30.149 --> 01:50:30.159 align:start position:0%
not going to make a difference and
 
01:50:31.030 --> 01:50:31.040 align:start position:0%
and i
 
01:50:32.790 --> 01:50:32.800 align:start position:0%
appreciate you letting me speak thank
 
01:50:32.800 --> 01:50:33.590 align:start position:0%
appreciate you letting me speak thank
you

01:50:33.590 --> 01:50:33.600 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:50:37.030 --> 01:50:37.040 align:start position:0%
thank you representative woodcock
 
01:50:39.109 --> 01:50:39.119 align:start position:0%
thank you represent lad um
 
01:50:41.189 --> 01:50:41.199 align:start position:0%
and i admit upfront that i'm a novice
 
01:50:42.629 --> 01:50:42.639 align:start position:0%
when it comes to
 
01:50:44.870 --> 01:50:44.880 align:start position:0%
moving bills through the house
 
01:50:47.109 --> 01:50:47.119 align:start position:0%
but i i got to tell you
 
01:50:48.629 --> 01:50:48.639 align:start position:0%
i'm a little just
 
01:50:50.229 --> 01:50:50.239 align:start position:0%
amazed here
 
01:50:53.910 --> 01:50:53.920 align:start position:0%
january 26th we had the hearing i took
 
01:50:56.870 --> 01:50:56.880 align:start position:0%
three pages of notes on a two-page bill
 
01:50:58.950 --> 01:50:58.960 align:start position:0%
that you and my friend representative
 
01:51:00.550 --> 01:51:00.560 align:start position:0%
allen put in
 
01:51:02.709 --> 01:51:02.719 align:start position:0%
and your comment was this bill is not
 
01:51:04.629 --> 01:51:04.639 align:start position:0%
fully developed yet it's not plausible
 
01:51:08.149 --> 01:51:08.159 align:start position:0%
that's your comment back in january 26th
 
01:51:11.189 --> 01:51:11.199 align:start position:0%
20 days later 20 days later i get a bill
 
01:51:13.510 --> 01:51:13.520 align:start position:0%
yesterday at six and a half pages last
 
01:51:16.390 --> 01:51:16.400 align:start position:0%
night that i'm trying to understand i
 
01:51:17.669 --> 01:51:17.679 align:start position:0%
get to the first screen we know it's
 
01:51:19.430 --> 01:51:19.440 align:start position:0%
about cash flow began i think there's a
 
01:51:21.189 --> 01:51:21.199 align:start position:0%
need to do this i think there's a need
 
01:51:23.669 --> 01:51:23.679 align:start position:0%
to do this just not this way it's to me
 
01:51:25.830 --> 01:51:25.840 align:start position:0%
it's a whole brand new bill uh mr
 
01:51:27.750 --> 01:51:27.760 align:start position:0%
chairman and and i'm and i'm
 
01:51:28.870 --> 01:51:28.880 align:start position:0%
you know i have a hard enough time i
 
01:51:30.390 --> 01:51:30.400 align:start position:0%
understand these things that it is and
 
01:51:31.990 --> 01:51:32.000 align:start position:0%
then when it comes on like this a day a
 
01:51:34.229 --> 01:51:34.239 align:start position:0%
day before if we had 20 days to look at
 
01:51:36.390 --> 01:51:36.400 align:start position:0%
it that that makes me nervous i'm just
 
01:51:39.589 --> 01:51:39.599 align:start position:0%
figuring out 35 and 65 percent and two
 
01:51:40.870 --> 01:51:40.880 align:start position:0%
and a half and three and a half percent
 
01:51:42.950 --> 01:51:42.960 align:start position:0%
and you're 20 80. i finally get my hand
 
01:51:45.189 --> 01:51:45.199 align:start position:0%
on all that and you bring an entirely
 
01:51:46.310 --> 01:51:46.320 align:start position:0%
new bill
 
01:51:48.470 --> 01:51:48.480 align:start position:0%
so i would appreciate the fact of it
 
01:51:50.390 --> 01:51:50.400 align:start position:0%
because i think it's needed but i sure
 
01:51:51.669 --> 01:51:51.679 align:start position:0%
would like the idea to have everybody
 
01:51:53.030 --> 01:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
talk more about it so we can understand
 
01:51:55.109 --> 01:51:55.119 align:start position:0%
it more fully and be lost on a bill i
 
01:51:57.189 --> 01:51:57.199 align:start position:0%
heard 20 days ago
 
01:51:58.870 --> 01:51:58.880 align:start position:0%

01:52:07.109 --> 01:52:07.119 align:start position:0%
as i've stated before you know some of
 
01:52:10.149 --> 01:52:10.159 align:start position:0%
the small districts in my floaterial
 
01:52:13.750 --> 01:52:13.760 align:start position:0%
have uh been talking about this so i am
 
01:52:15.990 --> 01:52:16.000 align:start position:0%
really really interested in supporting
 
01:52:17.350 --> 01:52:17.360 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:52:17.360 --> 01:52:19.990 align:start position:0%
this bill
however

01:52:19.990 --> 01:52:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:22.149 --> 01:52:22.159 align:start position:0%
as everybody before me has stated i
 
01:52:24.070 --> 01:52:24.080 align:start position:0%
haven't had a chance to go back and talk
 
01:52:26.229 --> 01:52:26.239 align:start position:0%
to the people in those communities
 
01:52:27.430 --> 01:52:27.440 align:start position:0%
to see
 
01:52:30.390 --> 01:52:30.400 align:start position:0%
if this is what they envisioned if
 
01:52:32.070 --> 01:52:32.080 align:start position:0%
they had some
 
01:52:34.229 --> 01:52:34.239 align:start position:0%
ideas about it if there's going to be
 
01:52:37.030 --> 01:52:37.040 align:start position:0%
some unintended consequences
 
01:52:39.270 --> 01:52:39.280 align:start position:0%
with passing a bill like this with the
 
01:52:41.430 --> 01:52:41.440 align:start position:0%
payment in special ed or with
 
01:52:43.430 --> 01:52:43.440 align:start position:0%
contracting with services
 
01:52:45.350 --> 01:52:45.360 align:start position:0%
is the insurance company like a health
 
01:52:47.189 --> 01:52:47.199 align:start position:0%
insurance company going to decide
 
01:52:51.189 --> 01:52:51.199 align:start position:0%
whether things are necessary
 
01:52:53.030 --> 01:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
are they going to decide whether they're
 
01:52:55.830 --> 01:52:55.840 align:start position:0%
going to pay the premium or the payment
 
01:52:58.310 --> 01:52:58.320 align:start position:0%
out to the schools or not
 
01:53:00.390 --> 01:53:00.400 align:start position:0%
there are so many questions with this
 
01:53:03.430 --> 01:53:03.440 align:start position:0%
and people have talked about it already
 
01:53:05.430 --> 01:53:05.440 align:start position:0%
i thoroughly agree with what
 
01:53:07.910 --> 01:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
representative shaw said and
 
01:53:11.350 --> 01:53:11.360 align:start position:0%
representative lay i would like to see
 
01:53:13.510 --> 01:53:13.520 align:start position:0%
more time spent with this
 
01:53:15.109 --> 01:53:15.119 align:start position:0%
get some people in from special
 
01:53:16.950 --> 01:53:16.960 align:start position:0%
education get the people from my
 
01:53:19.430 --> 01:53:19.440 align:start position:0%
district in to talk about it have a
 
01:53:22.149 --> 01:53:22.159 align:start position:0%
chance for us to go back and talk to our
 
01:53:24.870 --> 01:53:24.880 align:start position:0%
constituents about it
 
01:53:27.030 --> 01:53:27.040 align:start position:0%
this is a complicated
 
01:53:29.189 --> 01:53:29.199 align:start position:0%
complicated um
 
01:53:32.229 --> 01:53:32.239 align:start position:0%

um and again with possible unintended
consequences

01:53:40.229 --> 01:53:40.239 align:start position:0%

02:01:38.550 --> 02:01:38.560 align:start position:0%
they can go online and click oppose and
 
02:01:38.560 --> 02:01:39.669 align:start position:0%
they can go online and click oppose and
support

02:01:39.669 --> 02:01:39.679 align:start position:0%
support
 
02:01:42.229 --> 02:01:42.239 align:start position:0%
that that's not part of the executive
 
02:01:42.239 --> 02:01:43.589 align:start position:0%
that that's not part of the executive
session

02:01:43.589 --> 02:01:43.599 align:start position:0%
session
 
02:01:43.599 --> 02:01:48.390 align:start position:0%
session
okay

02:01:48.390 --> 02:01:48.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:52.870 --> 02:01:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:55.109 --> 02:01:55.119 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you i'm sorry i missed that
 
02:01:57.750 --> 02:01:57.760 align:start position:0%
my internet went down i guess i don't
 
02:02:00.470 --> 02:02:00.480 align:start position:0%
know might be something local
 
02:02:02.310 --> 02:02:02.320 align:start position:0%
well thank you uh oh i think it's
 
02:02:04.070 --> 02:02:04.080 align:start position:0%
happening all over the state frankly
 
02:02:06.470 --> 02:02:06.480 align:start position:0%
i've had the same problem yes it is
 
02:02:08.550 --> 02:02:08.560 align:start position:0%
occurring up here as we rebooted my
 
02:02:10.870 --> 02:02:10.880 align:start position:0%
cable motor anyway it went down
 
02:02:12.390 --> 02:02:12.400 align:start position:0%
it went down at the wrong time but i'm
 
02:02:12.400 --> 02:02:14.790 align:start position:0%
it went down at the wrong time but i'm
back

02:02:14.790 --> 02:02:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:17.189 --> 02:02:17.199 align:start position:0%
thank you may i add something to what uh
 
02:02:19.430 --> 02:02:19.440 align:start position:0%
you just told representative cannell
 
02:02:21.430 --> 02:02:21.440 align:start position:0%
actually on this bill
 
02:02:21.440 --> 02:02:22.390 align:start position:0%
actually on this bill
uh

02:02:22.390 --> 02:02:22.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:02:25.350 --> 02:02:25.360 align:start position:0%
there was like zero zero that came
 
02:02:29.350 --> 02:02:29.360 align:start position:0%
through on the uh to the to the uh to
 
02:02:32.550 --> 02:02:32.560 align:start position:0%
jennifer this morning and she said that
 
02:02:34.390 --> 02:02:34.400 align:start position:0%
uh they think there was some kind of a
 
02:02:36.629 --> 02:02:36.639 align:start position:0%
glitch in the in the system because
 
02:02:38.390 --> 02:02:38.400 align:start position:0%
nothing came through
 
02:02:41.669 --> 02:02:41.679 align:start position:0%
support or or opposed or anything and
 
02:02:44.310 --> 02:02:44.320 align:start position:0%
and so they're looking into it
 
02:02:45.589 --> 02:02:45.599 align:start position:0%
well um
 
02:02:48.870 --> 02:02:48.880 align:start position:0%
i called jen this morning i believe that
 
02:02:51.510 --> 02:02:51.520 align:start position:0%
because it's executive session
 
02:02:53.750 --> 02:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
uh we wouldn't be getting any of that
 
02:02:55.910 --> 02:02:55.920 align:start position:0%
information but i'm not
 
02:02:58.629 --> 02:02:58.639 align:start position:0%
uh so i called jen to tell her that she
 
02:03:00.470 --> 02:03:00.480 align:start position:0%
was concerned and thought there was a
 
02:03:03.189 --> 02:03:03.199 align:start position:0%
problem jen did you want to um that's
 
02:03:05.430 --> 02:03:05.440 align:start position:0%
that's exactly correct i
 
02:03:08.470 --> 02:03:08.480 align:start position:0%
on our dashboard it just um
 
02:03:10.790 --> 02:03:10.800 align:start position:0%
it doesn't read whether whether it's an
 
02:03:12.390 --> 02:03:12.400 align:start position:0%
executive session or a public hearing
 
02:03:14.390 --> 02:03:14.400 align:start position:0%
when i saw zero
 
02:03:15.910 --> 02:03:15.920 align:start position:0%
it was just completely my mistake for
 
02:03:17.669 --> 02:03:17.679 align:start position:0%
not double checking to see that it was
 
02:03:19.589 --> 02:03:19.599 align:start position:0%
an exact session so everything is fine
 
02:03:21.270 --> 02:03:21.280 align:start position:0%
on that side we shouldn't have expected
 
02:03:22.550 --> 02:03:22.560 align:start position:0%
any data
 
02:03:25.189 --> 02:03:25.199 align:start position:0%
on those and gcts has
 
02:03:27.189 --> 02:03:27.199 align:start position:0%
actually just since this morning
 
02:03:28.870 --> 02:03:28.880 align:start position:0%
improved what our screen looks like on
 
02:03:31.189 --> 02:03:31.199 align:start position:0%
this side so that um that confusion will
 
02:03:32.470 --> 02:03:32.480 align:start position:0%
pop up again
 
02:03:34.550 --> 02:03:34.560 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry rep shaw i should have told
 
02:03:37.430 --> 02:03:37.440 align:start position:0%
you i wasn't sure uh that i didn't know
 
02:03:39.910 --> 02:03:39.920 align:start position:0%
that you were on that email as well
 
02:03:39.920 --> 02:03:41.589 align:start position:0%
that you were on that email as well
so

02:03:41.589 --> 02:03:41.599 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:03:44.470 --> 02:03:44.480 align:start position:0%
just just to clarify for everybody in an
 
02:03:47.189 --> 02:03:47.199 align:start position:0%
executive session we do not read off
 
02:03:49.510 --> 02:03:49.520 align:start position:0%
those supporting and against
 
02:03:51.030 --> 02:03:51.040 align:start position:0%
this is
 
02:03:53.270 --> 02:03:53.280 align:start position:0%
this is our decision now this is a
 
02:03:55.510 --> 02:03:55.520 align:start position:0%
meeting of this committee
 
02:03:56.950 --> 02:03:56.960 align:start position:0%
and that's why everybody has the
 
02:03:58.390 --> 02:03:58.400 align:start position:0%
opportunity to voice whether they're
 
02:03:59.990 --> 02:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
supportive or against during that
 
02:04:02.709 --> 02:04:02.719 align:start position:0%
committee but to go back and do the
 
02:04:04.470 --> 02:04:04.480 align:start position:0%
hearing process and
 
02:04:07.270 --> 02:04:07.280 align:start position:0%
it's just not the way it's ever worked
 
02:04:09.750 --> 02:04:09.760 align:start position:0%
we have the opportunity to really exact
 
02:04:12.390 --> 02:04:12.400 align:start position:0%
any bill that we've heard at any time
 
02:04:14.070 --> 02:04:14.080 align:start position:0%
based with the notes that are in the
 
02:04:16.950 --> 02:04:16.960 align:start position:0%
calendar so represent lay i see you have
 
02:04:18.550 --> 02:04:18.560 align:start position:0%
a finger up there
 
02:04:18.560 --> 02:04:19.589 align:start position:0%
a finger up there
yeah

02:04:19.589 --> 02:04:19.599 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:04:21.189 --> 02:04:21.199 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i mean i think
 
02:04:23.189 --> 02:04:23.199 align:start position:0%
representative cornell was simply asking
 
02:04:26.149 --> 02:04:26.159 align:start position:0%
to go back into the record just as uh uh
 
02:04:28.149 --> 02:04:28.159 align:start position:0%
to just be reminded what those numbers
 
02:04:31.030 --> 02:04:31.040 align:start position:0%
were just as we could and we often do in
 
02:04:33.750 --> 02:04:33.760 align:start position:0%
executive session we ask for um
 
02:04:36.149 --> 02:04:36.159 align:start position:0%
a reminder or uh
 
02:04:38.149 --> 02:04:38.159 align:start position:0%
going back and looking at um some piece
 
02:04:40.229 --> 02:04:40.239 align:start position:0%
of testimony uh just to remind us what
 
02:04:41.910 --> 02:04:41.920 align:start position:0%
it was i mean that's not out of order i
 
02:04:43.750 --> 02:04:43.760 align:start position:0%
think that's all she's asking here is
 
02:04:45.350 --> 02:04:45.360 align:start position:0%
just what it was just what the number
 
02:04:47.350 --> 02:04:47.360 align:start position:0%
was at the end of the at the end of the
 
02:04:49.270 --> 02:04:49.280 align:start position:0%
hearing there it's i i fully understand
 
02:04:51.109 --> 02:04:51.119 align:start position:0%
nothing gets added in terms of the exact
 
02:04:54.070 --> 02:04:54.080 align:start position:0%
session so that that's a fair question
 
02:04:57.350 --> 02:04:57.360 align:start position:0%
and that's the way it it should work uh
 
02:04:59.669 --> 02:04:59.679 align:start position:0%
if during our discussions at any time
 
02:05:01.990 --> 02:05:02.000 align:start position:0%
somebody wants to ask that question the
 
02:05:03.910 --> 02:05:03.920 align:start position:0%
data is available
 
02:05:05.430 --> 02:05:05.440 align:start position:0%
but there's nothing going to be
 
02:05:07.589 --> 02:05:07.599 align:start position:0%
available as a result of people calling
 
02:05:10.229 --> 02:05:10.239 align:start position:0%
in on the executive session that's the
 
02:05:10.239 --> 02:05:11.350 align:start position:0%
in on the executive session that's the
point

02:05:11.350 --> 02:05:11.360 align:start position:0%
point
 
02:05:11.360 --> 02:05:13.350 align:start position:0%
point
okay

02:05:13.350 --> 02:05:13.360 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:05:13.360 --> 02:05:15.510 align:start position:0%
okay
yes

02:05:15.510 --> 02:05:15.520 align:start position:0%

02:05:22.629 --> 02:05:22.639 align:start position:0%
median of the ninth and i have i have
 
02:05:24.709 --> 02:05:24.719 align:start position:0%
the numbers that testify the numbers in
 
02:05:27.189 --> 02:05:27.199 align:start position:0%
favor number against the number neutral
 
02:05:29.109 --> 02:05:29.119 align:start position:0%
that you gave us at that point
 
02:05:31.430 --> 02:05:31.440 align:start position:0%
um in my notes here so i could i could
 
02:05:32.950 --> 02:05:32.960 align:start position:0%
clarify that for representative cornell
 
02:05:34.870 --> 02:05:34.880 align:start position:0%

02:05:41.520 --> 02:05:44.229 align:start position:0%
 
8607

02:05:48.790 --> 02:05:48.800 align:start position:0%
you're talking 607 that's fine we can
 
02:05:52.709 --> 02:05:52.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:55.669 --> 02:05:55.679 align:start position:0%
well i i have we have 16 testify
 
02:06:00.830 --> 02:06:00.840 align:start position:0%

okay are there is there further
 
02:06:03.280 --> 02:06:06.550 align:start position:0%
okay are there is there further
discussion

02:06:06.550 --> 02:06:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:09.189 --> 02:06:09.199 align:start position:0%
uh representative your hand is up is
 
02:06:12.790 --> 02:06:12.800 align:start position:0%
that are you you're you're not
 
02:06:15.189 --> 02:06:15.199 align:start position:0%
i did are you recognizing me mr chair
 
02:06:17.830 --> 02:06:17.840 align:start position:0%
well you see you you yeah yeah i have it
 
02:06:19.669 --> 02:06:19.679 align:start position:0%
up on the on the participant side as
 
02:06:21.990 --> 02:06:22.000 align:start position:0%
well uh just a brief thing i just the
 
02:06:23.990 --> 02:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
only reason i think it's worthwhile or
 
02:06:26.070 --> 02:06:26.080 align:start position:0%
um to ask what the numbers are is
 
02:06:28.870 --> 02:06:28.880 align:start position:0%
because the the uh registering supporter
 
02:06:30.550 --> 02:06:30.560 align:start position:0%
opposition i believe is open until
 
02:06:32.310 --> 02:06:32.320 align:start position:0%
midnight uh
 
02:06:33.990 --> 02:06:34.000 align:start position:0%
of the day of the hearing and so while
 
02:06:36.069 --> 02:06:36.079 align:start position:0%
the hearing we had a number at the time
 
02:06:37.669 --> 02:06:37.679 align:start position:0%
of the hearing but there may be
 
02:06:40.390 --> 02:06:40.400 align:start position:0%
additional supports or oppositions to a
 
02:06:42.470 --> 02:06:42.480 align:start position:0%
bill that come in up until midnight and
 
02:06:44.550 --> 02:06:44.560 align:start position:0%
so i think it's always useful to just
 
02:06:46.629 --> 02:06:46.639 align:start position:0%
get that at the final sort of tally
 
02:06:49.830 --> 02:06:49.840 align:start position:0%
that's all um because it is open in in
 
02:06:51.669 --> 02:06:51.679 align:start position:0%
you know in normal times the blue sheets
 
02:06:53.109 --> 02:06:53.119 align:start position:0%
would be collected and that's it it's
 
02:06:55.189 --> 02:06:55.199 align:start position:0%
done but apparently digitally it's open
 
02:06:56.950 --> 02:06:56.960 align:start position:0%
for a number of hours afterwards that's
 
02:06:58.629 --> 02:06:58.639 align:start position:0%
all thank you
 
02:07:00.310 --> 02:07:00.320 align:start position:0%
representative allard
 
02:07:03.109 --> 02:07:03.119 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman yet just just a
 
02:07:04.470 --> 02:07:04.480 align:start position:0%
point uh i
 
02:07:07.109 --> 02:07:07.119 align:start position:0%
like representative cordelli uh i too
 
02:07:09.189 --> 02:07:09.199 align:start position:0%
have had
 
02:07:11.669 --> 02:07:11.679 align:start position:0%
long conversations with the bill's prime
 
02:07:15.189 --> 02:07:15.199 align:start position:0%
sponsor and uh i very much support
 
02:07:15.199 --> 02:07:17.990 align:start position:0%
sponsor and uh i very much support
retention

02:07:17.990 --> 02:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:20.390 --> 02:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
further comments represent miler
 
02:07:22.870 --> 02:07:22.880 align:start position:0%
yes i'm going to vote no on this
 
02:07:25.510 --> 02:07:25.520 align:start position:0%
i i believe that this bill
 
02:07:27.910 --> 02:07:27.920 align:start position:0%
does not deserve to be retained
 
02:07:29.430 --> 02:07:29.440 align:start position:0%
we have house bill 20 which we're going
 
02:07:30.950 --> 02:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
to be looking at later in this week
 
02:07:33.109 --> 02:07:33.119 align:start position:0%
which i think is the primary issue
 
02:07:35.030 --> 02:07:35.040 align:start position:0%
dealing with vouchers
 
02:07:38.790 --> 02:07:38.800 align:start position:0%
and this particular bill i think is just
 
02:07:41.030 --> 02:07:41.040 align:start position:0%
way out there and i i don't think it
 
02:07:42.709 --> 02:07:42.719 align:start position:0%
deserves to be retained thank you very
 
02:07:45.109 --> 02:07:45.119 align:start position:0%
much thank you
 
02:07:53.189 --> 02:07:53.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:59.910 --> 02:07:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:01.109 --> 02:08:01.119 align:start position:0%
got it
 
02:08:03.189 --> 02:08:03.199 align:start position:0%
uh the thing about this bill is it's
 
02:08:07.589 --> 02:08:07.599 align:start position:0%
just enabling legislation
 
02:08:07.599 --> 02:08:08.629 align:start position:0%
just enabling legislation
and

02:08:08.629 --> 02:08:08.639 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:08:11.189 --> 02:08:11.199 align:start position:0%
i don't suspect very many towns are
 
02:08:12.950 --> 02:08:12.960 align:start position:0%
going to go for this
 
02:08:12.960 --> 02:08:13.830 align:start position:0%
going to go for this
but

02:08:13.830 --> 02:08:13.840 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:08:15.910 --> 02:08:15.920 align:start position:0%
there may be the few i can think of a
 
02:08:17.910 --> 02:08:17.920 align:start position:0%
couple who only have a very small
 
02:08:20.470 --> 02:08:20.480 align:start position:0%
elementary school and after that they
 
02:08:22.950 --> 02:08:22.960 align:start position:0%
have to tuition out their kids for most
 
02:08:25.589 --> 02:08:25.599 align:start position:0%
of everything anyways and they might go
 
02:08:28.629 --> 02:08:28.639 align:start position:0%
for this just to say that way
 
02:08:30.390 --> 02:08:30.400 align:start position:0%
instead of trying to decide where all
 
02:08:32.069 --> 02:08:32.079 align:start position:0%
their kids are going to go
 
02:08:33.830 --> 02:08:33.840 align:start position:0%
the parents can decide where to send
 
02:08:35.830 --> 02:08:35.840 align:start position:0%
their kids after like fourth grade i
 
02:08:37.669 --> 02:08:37.679 align:start position:0%
know there's one that just is k through
 
02:08:37.679 --> 02:08:38.470 align:start position:0%
know there's one that just is k through
four

02:08:38.470 --> 02:08:38.480 align:start position:0%
four
 
02:08:38.480 --> 02:08:39.750 align:start position:0%
four
so

02:08:39.750 --> 02:08:39.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:08:39.760 --> 02:08:40.870 align:start position:0%
so
um

02:08:40.870 --> 02:08:40.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:43.510 --> 02:08:43.520 align:start position:0%
that's really all it's for i don't see
 
02:08:46.310 --> 02:08:46.320 align:start position:0%
otherwise many towns taking this up but
 
02:08:48.629 --> 02:08:48.639 align:start position:0%
it should be available for those who do
 
02:08:51.350 --> 02:08:51.360 align:start position:0%
want to do it
 
02:08:53.510 --> 02:08:53.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
02:08:53.520 --> 02:08:55.350 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
i

02:08:55.350 --> 02:08:55.360 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:08:57.030 --> 02:08:57.040 align:start position:0%
represent shaw
 
02:08:57.040 --> 02:08:57.910 align:start position:0%
represent shaw
yes

02:08:57.910 --> 02:08:57.920 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:08:57.920 --> 02:08:59.270 align:start position:0%
yes
um

02:08:59.270 --> 02:08:59.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:59.280 --> 02:09:00.069 align:start position:0%
um
the

02:09:00.069 --> 02:09:00.079 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:09:02.550 --> 02:09:02.560 align:start position:0%
towns can already do that
 
02:09:04.470 --> 02:09:04.480 align:start position:0%
because i know in candia even though
 
02:09:06.470 --> 02:09:06.480 align:start position:0%
they have a a
 
02:09:09.109 --> 02:09:09.119 align:start position:0%
a distinct um
 
02:09:11.589 --> 02:09:11.599 align:start position:0%
or they have one school that they send
 
02:09:13.589 --> 02:09:13.599 align:start position:0%
them to they have in their
 
02:09:15.910 --> 02:09:15.920 align:start position:0%
own school board charter that the
 
02:09:17.830 --> 02:09:17.840 align:start position:0%
parents can
 
02:09:21.030 --> 02:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
appeal to the board and that the child
 
02:09:23.189 --> 02:09:23.199 align:start position:0%
can go to a different
 
02:09:26.629 --> 02:09:26.639 align:start position:0%
school so i think this is unnecessary i
 
02:09:28.629 --> 02:09:28.639 align:start position:0%
don't think we need to retain it
 
02:09:31.990 --> 02:09:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:38.229 --> 02:09:38.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:40.149 --> 02:09:40.159 align:start position:0%
represent layer your hand is still up
 
02:09:45.109 --> 02:09:45.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:47.109 --> 02:09:47.119 align:start position:0%
now i'd like to just offer my comments
 
02:09:49.189 --> 02:09:49.199 align:start position:0%
just very briefly which is that um i
 
02:09:51.030 --> 02:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
also would oppose retention i think this
 
02:09:53.990 --> 02:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
bill should be uh uh itld at this point
 
02:09:55.510 --> 02:09:55.520 align:start position:0%
um there are so many problems with the
 
02:09:57.990 --> 02:09:58.000 align:start position:0%
bill there's no fiscal note whatsoever
 
02:10:00.310 --> 02:10:00.320 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor himself could offer no
 
02:10:03.270 --> 02:10:03.280 align:start position:0%
insight into potential costs um even in
 
02:10:05.430 --> 02:10:05.440 align:start position:0%
his own town the bill i'm just going to
 
02:10:07.270 --> 02:10:07.280 align:start position:0%
name a couple of things i mean the bill
 
02:10:10.069 --> 02:10:10.079 align:start position:0%
says that um uh
 
02:10:11.830 --> 02:10:11.840 align:start position:0%
the monies can be used for private
 
02:10:13.750 --> 02:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
schools but current private school
 
02:10:16.629 --> 02:10:16.639 align:start position:0%
students are not eligible uh the prime
 
02:10:19.030 --> 02:10:19.040 align:start position:0%
sponsor couldn't figure that piece out
 
02:10:20.870 --> 02:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
there's nothing about how to define
 
02:10:24.069 --> 02:10:24.079 align:start position:0%
education services providers there's no
 
02:10:26.950 --> 02:10:26.960 align:start position:0%
surety bonds for those providers
 
02:10:29.030 --> 02:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
and i thought the most interesting and
 
02:10:32.229 --> 02:10:32.239 align:start position:0%
and probably uh uh
 
02:10:34.629 --> 02:10:34.639 align:start position:0%
i won't say dan well the mo the most
 
02:10:36.629 --> 02:10:36.639 align:start position:0%
interesting comment was simply when the
 
02:10:38.229 --> 02:10:38.239 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor was asked can i pay my
 
02:10:39.910 --> 02:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
sister to serve as a tutor and the
 
02:10:41.750 --> 02:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
answer was yes
 
02:10:44.390 --> 02:10:44.400 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether my sister has any
 
02:10:47.030 --> 02:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
capability or abilities whatsoever uh to
 
02:10:49.910 --> 02:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
do so so i think this bill is it's it is
 
02:10:52.310 --> 02:10:52.320 align:start position:0%
it is light years from being ready for
 
02:10:55.270 --> 02:10:55.280 align:start position:0%
prime time and uh should not even be
 
02:10:57.510 --> 02:10:57.520 align:start position:0%
retained the fact that we are willing to
 
02:10:59.589 --> 02:10:59.599 align:start position:0%
retain this bill but we are not willing
 
02:11:02.709 --> 02:11:02.719 align:start position:0%
to retain the prior bill um i think is
 
02:11:04.950 --> 02:11:04.960 align:start position:0%
is is not a very uh
 
02:11:07.510 --> 02:11:07.520 align:start position:0%
positive commentary upon um
 
02:11:09.030 --> 02:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
the actions of this committee today
 
02:11:10.390 --> 02:11:10.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:11:14.229 --> 02:11:14.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:17.510 --> 02:11:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:19.990 --> 02:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
here we go thank you mr chair um i just
 
02:11:22.550 --> 02:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
want to concur with representative lay i
 
02:11:25.990 --> 02:11:26.000 align:start position:0%
think this bill has so many issues um
 
02:11:28.550 --> 02:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
and just as as a member of the finance
 
02:11:31.270 --> 02:11:31.280 align:start position:0%
division two committee i certainly um
 
02:11:34.870 --> 02:11:34.880 align:start position:0%
would find it confusing and um
 
02:11:37.669 --> 02:11:37.679 align:start position:0%
would be tracked from um work that we
 
02:11:40.069 --> 02:11:40.079 align:start position:0%
really need to get done i i just don't
 
02:11:43.189 --> 02:11:43.199 align:start position:0%
think it's worthy of a lot of attention
 
02:11:44.229 --> 02:11:44.239 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:11:47.910 --> 02:11:47.920 align:start position:0%

03:43:32.950 --> 03:43:32.960 align:start position:0%
and addresses the
 
03:43:34.710 --> 03:43:34.720 align:start position:0%
problem with stabilization grant
 
03:43:34.720 --> 03:43:36.150 align:start position:0%
problem with stabilization grant
reductions

03:43:36.150 --> 03:43:36.160 align:start position:0%
reductions
 
03:43:39.189 --> 03:43:39.199 align:start position:0%
a little after i believe 2011 a new
 
03:43:41.349 --> 03:43:41.359 align:start position:0%
education funding formula was passed to
 
03:43:43.510 --> 03:43:43.520 align:start position:0%
address the donor town issue
 
03:43:45.349 --> 03:43:45.359 align:start position:0%
and that meant that a lot of money that
 
03:43:47.429 --> 03:43:47.439 align:start position:0%
had previously gone to towns would stop
 
03:43:50.070 --> 03:43:50.080 align:start position:0%
going to towns it was so much money
 
03:43:50.080 --> 03:43:51.110 align:start position:0%
going to towns it was so much money
that

03:43:51.110 --> 03:43:51.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:43:53.510 --> 03:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
nothing was done right then and then in
 
03:43:57.429 --> 03:43:57.439 align:start position:0%
2013 a 14 a gradual phase down began now
 
03:43:59.510 --> 03:43:59.520 align:start position:0%
when i say gradual
 
03:44:02.070 --> 03:44:02.080 align:start position:0%
to get a handle on this there are 5 000
 
03:44:03.670 --> 03:44:03.680 align:start position:0%
people in my town
 
03:44:06.150 --> 03:44:06.160 align:start position:0%
and the gradual is a hundred thousand
 
03:44:08.710 --> 03:44:08.720 align:start position:0%
dollars less in education funding over
 
03:44:11.670 --> 03:44:11.680 align:start position:0%
25 years that's just
 
03:44:14.150 --> 03:44:14.160 align:start position:0%
there's also uh claremont that will lose
 
03:44:16.389 --> 03:44:16.399 align:start position:0%
a whole lot more newport loses some
 
03:44:19.429 --> 03:44:19.439 align:start position:0%
franklin does manchester certainly
 
03:44:21.429 --> 03:44:21.439 align:start position:0%
and we haven't done anything about
 
03:44:23.990 --> 03:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
coming up with a new method to address
 
03:44:27.110 --> 03:44:27.120 align:start position:0%
property poor towns and
 
03:44:28.229 --> 03:44:28.239 align:start position:0%
towns that
 
03:44:30.630 --> 03:44:30.640 align:start position:0%
don't have the property base
 
03:44:32.469 --> 03:44:32.479 align:start position:0%
to deal with this uh the reduction i
 
03:44:33.990 --> 03:44:34.000 align:start position:0%
mean five thousand people a hundred
 
03:44:36.710 --> 03:44:36.720 align:start position:0%
grand a year that's a lot of money
 
03:44:38.150 --> 03:44:38.160 align:start position:0%
well why don't why don't they just spend
 
03:44:41.590 --> 03:44:41.600 align:start position:0%
less well we try to however
 
03:44:43.750 --> 03:44:43.760 align:start position:0%
they are one town in a five town
 
03:44:45.910 --> 03:44:45.920 align:start position:0%
district and my town consistently votes
 
03:44:47.670 --> 03:44:47.680 align:start position:0%
down the budget but the fact is that
 
03:44:49.269 --> 03:44:49.279 align:start position:0%
when we had that level of funding
 
03:44:50.630 --> 03:44:50.640 align:start position:0%
commitments were made
 
03:44:52.790 --> 03:44:52.800 align:start position:0%
staff were hired things were built and
 
03:44:55.189 --> 03:44:55.199 align:start position:0%
those bills don't go away so even if
 
03:44:57.590 --> 03:44:57.600 align:start position:0%
you've gone back to the default budget
 
03:44:59.590 --> 03:44:59.600 align:start position:0%
it's just not a sustainable model for
 
03:45:02.150 --> 03:45:02.160 align:start position:0%
these towns that have you know a
 
03:45:04.070 --> 03:45:04.080 align:start position:0%
disadvantaged population
 
03:45:06.790 --> 03:45:06.800 align:start position:0%
to continue to bear this now
 
03:45:08.309 --> 03:45:08.319 align:start position:0%
some of the urgency
 
03:45:09.990 --> 03:45:10.000 align:start position:0%
got taken away when we come up with
 
03:45:12.229 --> 03:45:12.239 align:start position:0%
one-time money one-time money is not a
 
03:45:15.269 --> 03:45:15.279 align:start position:0%
fix because well it's one-time money so
 
03:45:17.510 --> 03:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
even if the effect wasn't felt quite as
 
03:45:20.150 --> 03:45:20.160 align:start position:0%
hard in one year they have no security
 
03:45:22.070 --> 03:45:22.080 align:start position:0%
and no way to plan for what may happen
 
03:45:24.870 --> 03:45:24.880 align:start position:0%
the next year 608 is an attempt to to
 
03:45:27.590 --> 03:45:27.600 align:start position:0%
address that and a
 
03:45:30.150 --> 03:45:30.160 align:start position:0%
two-year study committee
 
03:45:31.670 --> 03:45:31.680 align:start position:0%
delved into this they met with
 
03:45:34.229 --> 03:45:34.239 align:start position:0%
stakeholders from across the spectrum
 
03:45:36.870 --> 03:45:36.880 align:start position:0%
voters the superintendents association
 
03:45:38.309 --> 03:45:38.319 align:start position:0%
the school districts themselves the
 
03:45:40.550 --> 03:45:40.560 align:start position:0%
education commissioner and produced
 
03:45:44.070 --> 03:45:44.080 align:start position:0%
report 2018 with a formula that would
 
03:45:46.950 --> 03:45:46.960 align:start position:0%
address this now a quick note
 
03:45:48.870 --> 03:45:48.880 align:start position:0%
why can't we just keep giving them the
 
03:45:50.870 --> 03:45:50.880 align:start position:0%
stabilization grants because they're
 
03:45:53.510 --> 03:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
based on 2011 student populations and
 
03:45:55.670 --> 03:45:55.680 align:start position:0%
the legislature cannot send adequacy
 
03:45:58.309 --> 03:45:58.319 align:start position:0%
funds for students who may or may not be
 
03:46:00.950 --> 03:46:00.960 align:start position:0%
there anymore so i agree stabilization
 
03:46:02.950 --> 03:46:02.960 align:start position:0%
grants have to go but the support must
 
03:46:02.960 --> 03:46:04.070 align:start position:0%
grants have to go but the support must
stay

03:46:04.070 --> 03:46:04.080 align:start position:0%
stay
 
03:46:06.229 --> 03:46:06.239 align:start position:0%
the roots of that report became house
 
03:46:08.389 --> 03:46:08.399 align:start position:0%
bill 709 in a previous session which
 
03:46:10.229 --> 03:46:10.239 align:start position:0%
made it out of this committee and then
 
03:46:11.830 --> 03:46:11.840 align:start position:0%
died in finance
 
03:46:14.070 --> 03:46:14.080 align:start position:0%
ultimately what we got was another
 
03:46:17.830 --> 03:46:17.840 align:start position:0%
two-year study and still no solution and
 
03:46:17.840 --> 03:46:18.870 align:start position:0%
two-year study and still no solution and
still

03:46:18.870 --> 03:46:18.880 align:start position:0%
still
 
03:46:23.030 --> 03:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
the aid going down every single year so
 
03:46:26.950 --> 03:46:26.960 align:start position:0%
my plea to you is stop the bleeding um
 
03:46:26.960 --> 03:46:27.670 align:start position:0%
my plea to you is stop the bleeding um
the

03:46:27.670 --> 03:46:27.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:46:29.830 --> 03:46:29.840 align:start position:0%
arguments about income tax capital gains
 
03:46:31.590 --> 03:46:31.600 align:start position:0%
tax this source of funding that source
 
03:46:34.550 --> 03:46:34.560 align:start position:0%
funding you know what i don't care
 
03:46:37.349 --> 03:46:37.359 align:start position:0%
please pass the bill as is amend the
 
03:46:39.590 --> 03:46:39.600 align:start position:0%
bill i don't care what you do as long as
 
03:46:42.389 --> 03:46:42.399 align:start position:0%
it solves the problem of small towns
 
03:46:44.309 --> 03:46:44.319 align:start position:0%
through no fault of their own at this
 
03:46:46.469 --> 03:46:46.479 align:start position:0%
point through multiple administrations
 
03:46:48.790 --> 03:46:48.800 align:start position:0%
of different select boards and school
 
03:46:51.030 --> 03:46:51.040 align:start position:0%
board members finding themselves having
 
03:46:52.950 --> 03:46:52.960 align:start position:0%
to deal with hundreds of thousands of
 
03:46:56.150 --> 03:46:56.160 align:start position:0%
dollars in reduced aid every single year
 
03:46:58.070 --> 03:46:58.080 align:start position:0%
um that's my pitch and i leave it in
 
03:47:02.790 --> 03:47:02.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:05.030 --> 03:47:05.040 align:start position:0%
thank key representative do we have uh
 
03:47:09.030 --> 03:47:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:14.710 --> 03:47:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:19.030 --> 03:47:19.040 align:start position:0%
yes i was curious um back last
 
03:47:19.040 --> 03:47:20.389 align:start position:0%
yes i was curious um back last
biennium

03:47:20.389 --> 03:47:20.399 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
03:47:22.389 --> 03:47:22.399 align:start position:0%
when we went through funding
 
03:47:24.950 --> 03:47:24.960 align:start position:0%
we took all of our step functions out
 
03:47:26.870 --> 03:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
and replaced them with straight line
 
03:47:26.880 --> 03:47:28.150 align:start position:0%
and replaced them with straight line
functions

03:47:28.150 --> 03:47:28.160 align:start position:0%
functions
 
03:47:31.590 --> 03:47:31.600 align:start position:0%
and i was wondering um why you didn't do
 
03:47:33.269 --> 03:47:33.279 align:start position:0%
that this time
 
03:47:35.830 --> 03:47:35.840 align:start position:0%
because just one student can make a huge
 
03:47:37.990 --> 03:47:38.000 align:start position:0%
difference in what a town gets
 
03:47:39.830 --> 03:47:39.840 align:start position:0%
and i are just a small amount of
 
03:47:39.840 --> 03:47:41.110 align:start position:0%
and i are just a small amount of
difference

03:47:41.110 --> 03:47:41.120 align:start position:0%
difference
 
03:47:42.550 --> 03:47:42.560 align:start position:0%
so i'm
 
03:47:44.790 --> 03:47:44.800 align:start position:0%
just wondering
 
03:47:47.590 --> 03:47:47.600 align:start position:0%
the advice of education policy folks
 
03:47:49.830 --> 03:47:49.840 align:start position:0%
smarter than myself i was asked to
 
03:47:51.269 --> 03:47:51.279 align:start position:0%
change the initial version of a bill
 
03:47:54.070 --> 03:47:54.080 align:start position:0%
that i filed and i concurred um eric
 
03:47:55.910 --> 03:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
said it i don't really care what the
 
03:47:57.030 --> 03:47:57.040 align:start position:0%
method is
 
03:47:58.309 --> 03:47:58.319 align:start position:0%
some of the things that were brought up
 
03:47:59.750 --> 03:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
with a look at free and reduced lunch
 
03:48:02.389 --> 03:48:02.399 align:start position:0%
populations and assigned grants to that
 
03:48:04.150 --> 03:48:04.160 align:start position:0%
adding in performance
 
03:48:06.630 --> 03:48:06.640 align:start position:0%
i literally don't care on what the
 
03:48:08.309 --> 03:48:08.319 align:start position:0%
method is and i imagine that your
 
03:48:10.550 --> 03:48:10.560 align:start position:0%
committee will probably amend the bill
 
03:48:12.950 --> 03:48:12.960 align:start position:0%
if it solves the problem of these grant
 
03:48:15.429 --> 03:48:15.439 align:start position:0%
reductions to these towns
 
03:48:20.870 --> 03:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:22.469 --> 03:48:22.479 align:start position:0%
any further questions for the
 
03:48:22.479 --> 03:48:25.750 align:start position:0%
any further questions for the
representative

03:48:25.750 --> 03:48:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:29.030 --> 03:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
i do not see any uh so thank you very
 
03:48:31.510 --> 03:48:31.520 align:start position:0%
much representative smith thank you mr
 
03:48:36.309 --> 03:48:36.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:39.429 --> 03:48:39.439 align:start position:0%
representative hopson um
 
03:48:42.550 --> 03:48:42.560 align:start position:0%
we have uh jeff nick lynch scheduled to
 
03:48:44.710 --> 03:48:44.720 align:start position:0%
testify next and i've promoted him to
 
03:48:48.630 --> 03:48:48.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:52.550 --> 03:48:52.560 align:start position:0%
um um mr chair point of order
 
03:48:52.560 --> 03:48:53.510 align:start position:0%
um um mr chair point of order
yes

03:48:53.510 --> 03:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:48:56.150 --> 03:48:56.160 align:start position:0%
um so thanks very much mr chair i know
 
03:48:59.110 --> 03:48:59.120 align:start position:0%
representative ladd i think had um had
 
03:49:01.189 --> 03:49:01.199 align:start position:0%
sent an amendment over
 
03:49:04.150 --> 03:49:04.160 align:start position:0%
yesterday to the committee
 
03:49:04.160 --> 03:49:04.870 align:start position:0%
yesterday to the committee
and

03:49:04.870 --> 03:49:04.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:49:07.590 --> 03:49:07.600 align:start position:0%
the amendment replaces the
 
03:49:09.910 --> 03:49:09.920 align:start position:0%
every the amendment essentially replaces
 
03:49:12.150 --> 03:49:12.160 align:start position:0%
the bill all after the enacting clause
 
03:49:14.870 --> 03:49:14.880 align:start position:0%
and i was just wondering is this a um a
 
03:49:16.870 --> 03:49:16.880 align:start position:0%
hearing on the
 
03:49:18.790 --> 03:49:18.800 align:start position:0%
bill are we talking about the bill as
 
03:49:20.870 --> 03:49:20.880 align:start position:0%
amended or are we talking about
 
03:49:23.349 --> 03:49:23.359 align:start position:0%
the bill is not amended
 
03:49:27.429 --> 03:49:27.439 align:start position:0%
right now the uh the bill itself um
 
03:49:29.030 --> 03:49:29.040 align:start position:0%
the amendment has not been introduced
 
03:49:31.670 --> 03:49:31.680 align:start position:0%
yet no i i understand but the bill
 
03:49:33.269 --> 03:49:33.279 align:start position:0%
hasn't real i mean we're we're just
 
03:49:35.030 --> 03:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
starting this hearing and i was just
 
03:49:37.110 --> 03:49:37.120 align:start position:0%
wondering what what um what
 
03:49:39.429 --> 03:49:39.439 align:start position:0%
representative ladd would would like to
 
03:49:41.349 --> 03:49:41.359 align:start position:0%
do as far as what we're talking about
 
03:49:41.359 --> 03:49:43.189 align:start position:0%
do as far as what we're talking about
here

03:49:43.189 --> 03:49:43.199 align:start position:0%
here
 
03:49:44.870 --> 03:49:44.880 align:start position:0%
representative land
 
03:49:48.309 --> 03:49:48.319 align:start position:0%
yeah i i uh mr chair
 
03:49:50.870 --> 03:49:50.880 align:start position:0%
there is an amendment and the amendment
 
03:49:53.429 --> 03:49:53.439 align:start position:0%
as representative states replaces the
 
03:49:53.439 --> 03:49:54.710 align:start position:0%
as representative states replaces the
bill

03:49:54.710 --> 03:49:54.720 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:49:57.429 --> 03:49:57.439 align:start position:0%
and the amendment has
 
03:49:59.269 --> 03:49:59.279 align:start position:0%
been sent out to all people on the
 
03:49:59.279 --> 03:50:00.469 align:start position:0%
been sent out to all people on the
committee

03:50:00.469 --> 03:50:00.479 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:50:03.189 --> 03:50:03.199 align:start position:0%
i think it's appropriate that
 
03:50:06.309 --> 03:50:06.319 align:start position:0%
seeing that the original bill as it was
 
03:50:06.319 --> 03:50:07.429 align:start position:0%
seeing that the original bill as it was
written

03:50:07.429 --> 03:50:07.439 align:start position:0%
written
 
03:50:09.670 --> 03:50:09.680 align:start position:0%
uh was a reflection of one of the
 
03:50:11.510 --> 03:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
amendments that came up
 
03:50:13.429 --> 03:50:13.439 align:start position:0%
what was it several years ago when we're
 
03:50:16.950 --> 03:50:16.960 align:start position:0%
dealing with hb 709
 
03:50:18.469 --> 03:50:18.479 align:start position:0%
and it
 
03:50:21.349 --> 03:50:21.359 align:start position:0%
included uh components which
 
03:50:23.830 --> 03:50:23.840 align:start position:0%
uh obviously uh
 
03:50:27.590 --> 03:50:27.600 align:start position:0%
were not accepted uh so i think for
 
03:50:29.590 --> 03:50:29.600 align:start position:0%
for sake of time here
 
03:50:32.550 --> 03:50:32.560 align:start position:0%
i think represent luno is is correct in
 
03:50:33.750 --> 03:50:33.760 align:start position:0%
saying that are we going to be
 
03:50:33.760 --> 03:50:35.349 align:start position:0%
saying that are we going to be
discussing

03:50:35.349 --> 03:50:35.359 align:start position:0%
discussing
 
03:50:37.510 --> 03:50:37.520 align:start position:0%
something that's not really on the board
 
03:50:39.429 --> 03:50:39.439 align:start position:0%
at all as far as you know
 
03:50:41.349 --> 03:50:41.359 align:start position:0%
logically i don't think we should be
 
03:50:43.110 --> 03:50:43.120 align:start position:0%
talking about the bill as it was
 
03:50:43.120 --> 03:50:44.389 align:start position:0%
talking about the bill as it was
introduced

03:50:44.389 --> 03:50:44.399 align:start position:0%
introduced
 
03:50:46.950 --> 03:50:46.960 align:start position:0%
unless you want to get into a great lot
 
03:50:49.429 --> 03:50:49.439 align:start position:0%
of discussion regarding swep at this
 
03:50:49.439 --> 03:50:50.790 align:start position:0%
of discussion regarding swep at this
time

03:50:50.790 --> 03:50:50.800 align:start position:0%
time
 
03:50:53.110 --> 03:50:53.120 align:start position:0%
and and or do you want to get involved
 
03:50:56.070 --> 03:50:56.080 align:start position:0%
with the the bill as it probably will
 
03:51:02.389 --> 03:51:02.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:05.510 --> 03:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
representative la uh chairman led uh i
 
03:51:06.710 --> 03:51:06.720 align:start position:0%

03:51:09.590 --> 03:51:09.600 align:start position:0%

03:51:11.750 --> 03:51:11.760 align:start position:0%
i did not see that amendment did you say
 
03:51:13.750 --> 03:51:13.760 align:start position:0%

03:51:17.670 --> 03:51:17.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:17.680 --> 03:51:19.910 align:start position:0%

for the record my name is rick ladd i am
 
03:51:59.110 --> 03:51:59.120 align:start position:0%
a representative from the town of
 
03:51:59.120 --> 03:52:00.550 align:start position:0%
a representative from the town of
haverhill

03:52:00.550 --> 03:52:00.560 align:start position:0%
haverhill
 
03:52:03.590 --> 03:52:03.600 align:start position:0%
and i will address this bill
 
03:52:05.950 --> 03:52:05.960 align:start position:0%
primarily from the focus of amendment
 
03:52:09.750 --> 03:52:09.760 align:start position:0%
0323h which you all have
 
03:52:13.189 --> 03:52:13.199 align:start position:0%
a couple just overarching type points
 
03:52:14.790 --> 03:52:14.800 align:start position:0%
about this bill
 
03:52:17.110 --> 03:52:17.120 align:start position:0%
as amend as it would be amended with
 
03:52:19.349 --> 03:52:19.359 align:start position:0%
this amendment one
 
03:52:23.269 --> 03:52:23.279 align:start position:0%
there it uh there is no change in terms
 
03:52:26.309 --> 03:52:26.319 align:start position:0%
of incorp there is a change in terms of
 
03:52:28.550 --> 03:52:28.560 align:start position:0%
incorporating swept in the bill swept is
 
03:52:30.229 --> 03:52:30.239 align:start position:0%
not in this bill
 
03:52:32.070 --> 03:52:32.080 align:start position:0%
so the changes to it
 
03:52:34.790 --> 03:52:34.800 align:start position:0%
to excess swept monies
 
03:52:38.710 --> 03:52:38.720 align:start position:0%
remains unchanged the town which is the
 
03:52:40.950 --> 03:52:40.960 align:start position:0%
wealthy town now that can teach
 
03:52:43.110 --> 03:52:43.120 align:start position:0%
keep excess dollar
 
03:52:44.950 --> 03:52:44.960 align:start position:0%
keeps excess dollar
 
03:52:47.349 --> 03:52:47.359 align:start position:0%
so that's as it is right now
 
03:52:47.359 --> 03:52:48.950 align:start position:0%
so that's as it is right now
stabilization

03:52:48.950 --> 03:52:48.960 align:start position:0%
stabilization
 
03:52:51.910 --> 03:52:51.920 align:start position:0%
in this uh bill or this as it would be
 
03:52:56.070 --> 03:52:56.080 align:start position:0%
amended stabilization is totally gone
 
03:52:58.070 --> 03:52:58.080 align:start position:0%
that was a recommendation that came out
 
03:53:00.710 --> 03:53:00.720 align:start position:0%
of the 2013 report
 
03:53:03.590 --> 03:53:03.600 align:start position:0%
and i believe it was a recommendation
 
03:53:05.349 --> 03:53:05.359 align:start position:0%
also from the funding commission this
 
03:53:07.429 --> 03:53:07.439 align:start position:0%
summer and fall that
 
03:53:10.150 --> 03:53:10.160 align:start position:0%
stabilization does nothing that's really
 
03:53:10.160 --> 03:53:11.110 align:start position:0%
stabilization does nothing that's really
good

03:53:11.110 --> 03:53:11.120 align:start position:0%
good
 
03:53:13.910 --> 03:53:13.920 align:start position:0%
for education it's not reliable it
 
03:53:16.469 --> 03:53:16.479 align:start position:0%
deducts each year that four percent
 
03:53:19.189 --> 03:53:19.199 align:start position:0%
which is i i think even
 
03:53:21.830 --> 03:53:21.840 align:start position:0%
deputy speaker smith talked about that
 
03:53:24.229 --> 03:53:24.239 align:start position:0%
how it's it's it's tearing charlestown
 
03:53:26.070 --> 03:53:26.080 align:start position:0%
apart it's tearing a lot of little towns
 
03:53:26.080 --> 03:53:26.950 align:start position:0%
apart it's tearing a lot of little towns
apart

03:53:26.950 --> 03:53:26.960 align:start position:0%
apart
 
03:53:29.349 --> 03:53:29.359 align:start position:0%
the cpi
 
03:53:31.590 --> 03:53:31.600 align:start position:0%
which we have that at the beginning of
 
03:53:33.349 --> 03:53:33.359 align:start position:0%
every biennium
 
03:53:35.590 --> 03:53:35.600 align:start position:0%
certain costs within the
 
03:53:37.910 --> 03:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
adequate education formula are increased
 
03:53:41.349 --> 03:53:41.359 align:start position:0%
according to the cpi that continues that
 
03:53:41.359 --> 03:53:42.870 align:start position:0%
according to the cpi that continues that
continues

03:53:42.870 --> 03:53:42.880 align:start position:0%
continues
 
03:53:45.429 --> 03:53:45.439 align:start position:0%
does this uh amended version have
 
03:53:48.070 --> 03:53:48.080 align:start position:0%
physical capacity disparity aid yes it
 
03:53:51.110 --> 03:53:51.120 align:start position:0%
does and i will get into the components
 
03:53:53.189 --> 03:53:53.199 align:start position:0%
the two areas within the bill that have
 
03:53:55.910 --> 03:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
fiscal capacity disparity aid physical
 
03:53:58.469 --> 03:53:58.479 align:start position:0%
capacity disparity aid was once in the
 
03:54:01.830 --> 03:54:01.840 align:start position:0%
joint resolution that came out of 2008
 
03:54:02.830 --> 03:54:02.840 align:start position:0%
the joint
 
03:54:05.750 --> 03:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
legislative legislation for the costing
 
03:54:07.590 --> 03:54:07.600 align:start position:0%
of an adequate education it came out
 
03:54:10.229 --> 03:54:10.239 align:start position:0%
there it was taken out of
 
03:54:10.239 --> 03:54:11.030 align:start position:0%
there it was taken out of
the

03:54:11.030 --> 03:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:54:12.550 --> 03:54:12.560 align:start position:0%
current formula
 
03:54:12.560 --> 03:54:13.429 align:start position:0%
current formula
uh

03:54:13.429 --> 03:54:13.439 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:54:14.630 --> 03:54:14.640 align:start position:0%
of almost
 
03:54:14.640 --> 03:54:15.510 align:start position:0%
of almost
now

03:54:15.510 --> 03:54:15.520 align:start position:0%
now
 
03:54:19.030 --> 03:54:19.040 align:start position:0%
a good eight years ago
 
03:54:21.189 --> 03:54:21.199 align:start position:0%
going further
 
03:54:21.199 --> 03:54:22.630 align:start position:0%
going further
there

03:54:22.630 --> 03:54:22.640 align:start position:0%
there
 
03:54:26.309 --> 03:54:26.319 align:start position:0%
additional aid based on free and reduced
 
03:54:29.349 --> 03:54:29.359 align:start position:0%
meal plan this aid is provided both to
 
03:54:31.429 --> 03:54:31.439 align:start position:0%
the traditional school and the charter
 
03:54:31.439 --> 03:54:33.750 align:start position:0%
the traditional school and the charter
schools

03:54:33.750 --> 03:54:33.760 align:start position:0%
schools
 
03:54:36.309 --> 03:54:36.319 align:start position:0%
okay additional aid based upon equalized
 
03:54:38.550 --> 03:54:38.560 align:start position:0%
valuation and testing scores as part of
 
03:54:40.950 --> 03:54:40.960 align:start position:0%
fiscal capacity disparity aid that has
 
03:54:42.070 --> 03:54:42.080 align:start position:0%
also been
 
03:54:45.030 --> 03:54:45.040 align:start position:0%
added into this bill
 
03:54:47.110 --> 03:54:47.120 align:start position:0%
so i will get into these these
 
03:54:49.990 --> 03:54:50.000 align:start position:0%
components as i uh
 
03:54:52.150 --> 03:54:52.160 align:start position:0%
go through the amendment
 
03:54:55.110 --> 03:54:55.120 align:start position:0%
um i would also like to state one as one
 
03:54:56.710 --> 03:54:56.720 align:start position:0%
thing right here which is a
 
03:54:59.269 --> 03:54:59.279 align:start position:0%
constitutional issue when it comes to
 
03:54:59.279 --> 03:55:01.429 align:start position:0%
constitutional issue when it comes to
funding

03:55:01.429 --> 03:55:01.439 align:start position:0%
funding
 
03:55:03.189 --> 03:55:03.199 align:start position:0%
whatever the state identifies as
 
03:55:05.269 --> 03:55:05.279 align:start position:0%
comprising a constitutional adequate
 
03:55:08.790 --> 03:55:08.800 align:start position:0%
education the state must pay for
 
03:55:11.429 --> 03:55:11.439 align:start position:0%
none of that financial obligation
 
03:55:14.150 --> 03:55:14.160 align:start position:0%
can be shifted to local districts
 
03:55:18.389 --> 03:55:18.399 align:start position:0%
regardless of their wealth or need
 
03:55:20.950 --> 03:55:20.960 align:start position:0%
okay that comes out of the londonderry
 
03:55:20.960 --> 03:55:22.790 align:start position:0%
okay that comes out of the londonderry
case

03:55:22.790 --> 03:55:22.800 align:start position:0%
case
 
03:55:22.800 --> 03:55:24.389 align:start position:0%
case
so

03:55:24.389 --> 03:55:24.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:55:27.110 --> 03:55:27.120 align:start position:0%
and it's also the constitutional
 
03:55:27.120 --> 03:55:29.910 align:start position:0%
and it's also the constitutional
responsibility

03:55:29.910 --> 03:55:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:31.910 --> 03:55:31.920 align:start position:0%
of the legislature
 
03:55:31.920 --> 03:55:33.189 align:start position:0%
of the legislature
to

03:55:33.189 --> 03:55:33.199 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:55:35.830 --> 03:55:35.840 align:start position:0%
define adequate education
 
03:55:37.269 --> 03:55:37.279 align:start position:0%
and those are two points which i've
 
03:55:39.990 --> 03:55:40.000 align:start position:0%
tried to follow as i went through and
 
03:55:43.830 --> 03:55:43.840 align:start position:0%
and developed this amending language
 
03:55:46.150 --> 03:55:46.160 align:start position:0%
there are components to and the other
 
03:55:47.670 --> 03:55:47.680 align:start position:0%
thing i would like to mention right from
 
03:55:49.670 --> 03:55:49.680 align:start position:0%
the onset i know that there's going to
 
03:55:51.670 --> 03:55:51.680 align:start position:0%
be questions that where is the fiscal
 
03:55:51.680 --> 03:55:53.110 align:start position:0%
be questions that where is the fiscal
note

03:55:53.110 --> 03:55:53.120 align:start position:0%
note
 
03:55:55.510 --> 03:55:55.520 align:start position:0%
i i've contacted legislative budget
 
03:55:55.520 --> 03:55:56.710 align:start position:0%
i i've contacted legislative budget
office

03:55:56.710 --> 03:55:56.720 align:start position:0%
office
 
03:56:00.710 --> 03:56:00.720 align:start position:0%
assistant and they have not gotten that
 
03:56:02.550 --> 03:56:02.560 align:start position:0%
uh information together in fact they
 
03:56:04.870 --> 03:56:04.880 align:start position:0%
haven't been even given this amendment
 
03:56:09.110 --> 03:56:09.120 align:start position:0%
which has been out now since february 10
 
03:56:11.830 --> 03:56:11.840 align:start position:0%
so i have contacted the department of
 
03:56:14.150 --> 03:56:14.160 align:start position:0%
education and i've been assured there
 
03:56:15.670 --> 03:56:15.680 align:start position:0%
will be a
 
03:56:17.429 --> 03:56:17.439 align:start position:0%
fiscal analysis
 
03:56:20.550 --> 03:56:20.560 align:start position:0%
as developed by them by tomorrow
 
03:56:20.560 --> 03:56:23.590 align:start position:0%
as developed by them by tomorrow
afternoon

03:56:23.590 --> 03:56:23.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:25.830 --> 03:56:25.840 align:start position:0%
so moving on down here
 
03:56:29.510 --> 03:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
one of the things that this bill
 
03:56:31.030 --> 03:56:31.040 align:start position:0%
tries to avoid
 
03:56:33.110 --> 03:56:33.120 align:start position:0%
is additional taxes
 
03:56:33.120 --> 03:56:34.309 align:start position:0%
is additional taxes
um

03:56:34.309 --> 03:56:34.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:56:37.349 --> 03:56:37.359 align:start position:0%
uh of any great magnitude and we i
 
03:56:39.670 --> 03:56:39.680 align:start position:0%
understand that revenue and expenditures
 
03:56:42.229 --> 03:56:42.239 align:start position:0%
are part of this whole thing
 
03:56:44.389 --> 03:56:44.399 align:start position:0%
and they must be discussed but there
 
03:56:47.110 --> 03:56:47.120 align:start position:0%
will be no tax dollar taken from a
 
03:56:50.150 --> 03:56:50.160 align:start position:0%
wealthy town to pay the the needs for
 
03:56:52.790 --> 03:56:52.800 align:start position:0%
education in a poorer town
 
03:56:55.750 --> 03:56:55.760 align:start position:0%
that is not part of this equation
 
03:56:59.269 --> 03:56:59.279 align:start position:0%
um for so increased costing for the
 
03:57:01.830 --> 03:57:01.840 align:start position:0%
lower town will not be subsidized by
 
03:57:04.550 --> 03:57:04.560 align:start position:0%
increasing or doubling the tax rate for
 
03:57:06.550 --> 03:57:06.560 align:start position:0%
the community which has that higher
 
03:57:10.309 --> 03:57:10.319 align:start position:0%
level of uh of ability to raise uh
 
03:57:12.870 --> 03:57:12.880 align:start position:0%
dollars right now
 
03:57:15.429 --> 03:57:15.439 align:start position:0%
so going on down through this bill as as
 
03:57:15.439 --> 03:57:16.710 align:start position:0%
so going on down through this bill as as
amended

03:57:16.710 --> 03:57:16.720 align:start position:0%
amended
 
03:57:19.590 --> 03:57:19.600 align:start position:0%
there we still have a component called
 
03:57:21.349 --> 03:57:21.359 align:start position:0%
base cost
 
03:57:24.070 --> 03:57:24.080 align:start position:0%
base cost is the old cost which was
 
03:57:26.389 --> 03:57:26.399 align:start position:0%
developed back in 3008
 
03:57:28.309 --> 03:57:28.319 align:start position:0%
and at that time it was three thousand
 
03:57:30.469 --> 03:57:30.479 align:start position:0%
four hundred and fifty six dollars and
 
03:57:32.389 --> 03:57:32.399 align:start position:0%
that was the universal cost based upon
 
03:57:34.710 --> 03:57:34.720 align:start position:0%
the high school and the lower end the
 
03:57:36.790 --> 03:57:36.800 align:start position:0%
elementary middle school levels they
 
03:57:39.750 --> 03:57:39.760 align:start position:0%
combined it and they had the one cost
 
03:57:42.790 --> 03:57:42.800 align:start position:0%
now what i've got there in this bill as
 
03:57:46.790 --> 03:57:46.800 align:start position:0%
the cost for the education in 2021 would
 
03:57:50.469 --> 03:57:50.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:52.950 --> 03:57:52.960 align:start position:0%
that's cpi adjustments that's just
 
03:57:55.830 --> 03:57:55.840 align:start position:0%
moving along where we are right now
 
03:57:59.189 --> 03:57:59.199 align:start position:0%
so the base basically changes based upon
 
03:58:01.590 --> 03:58:01.600 align:start position:0%
the cpi for the beginning of each
 
03:58:01.600 --> 03:58:03.990 align:start position:0%
the cpi for the beginning of each
biennium

03:58:03.990 --> 03:58:04.000 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
03:58:06.790 --> 03:58:06.800 align:start position:0%
there also are components within this
 
03:58:06.800 --> 03:58:07.670 align:start position:0%
there also are components within this
where

03:58:07.670 --> 03:58:07.680 align:start position:0%
where
 
03:58:11.349 --> 03:58:11.359 align:start position:0%
adequacy is comprised of two categories
 
03:58:13.910 --> 03:58:13.920 align:start position:0%
one of which is the base cost and the
 
03:58:16.389 --> 03:58:16.399 align:start position:0%
other is your differentiated cost that
 
03:58:18.550 --> 03:58:18.560 align:start position:0%
is the portion of dollars in funding
 
03:58:20.950 --> 03:58:20.960 align:start position:0%
which supports the child who needs
 
03:58:22.790 --> 03:58:22.800 align:start position:0%
additional support
 
03:58:24.070 --> 03:58:24.080 align:start position:0%
to meet these
 
03:58:25.990 --> 03:58:26.000 align:start position:0%
based needs
 
03:58:26.000 --> 03:58:26.950 align:start position:0%
based needs
and

03:58:26.950 --> 03:58:26.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:58:29.830 --> 03:58:29.840 align:start position:0%
that those categories are the ones we're
 
03:58:32.389 --> 03:58:32.399 align:start position:0%
all familiar with with the
 
03:58:34.150 --> 03:58:34.160 align:start position:0%
free and reduced with the english
 
03:58:35.830 --> 03:58:35.840 align:start position:0%
language warrant learner
 
03:58:39.269 --> 03:58:39.279 align:start position:0%
and the special education costs i do not
 
03:58:41.429 --> 03:58:41.439 align:start position:0%
have linked in this particular bill the
 
03:58:43.750 --> 03:58:43.760 align:start position:0%
monies which if you don't qualify in the
 
03:58:46.070 --> 03:58:46.080 align:start position:0%
other areas those three areas you would
 
03:58:49.030 --> 03:58:49.040 align:start position:0%
get support for the third grade reading
 
03:58:51.349 --> 03:58:51.359 align:start position:0%
that was not really a significant hunk
 
03:58:53.830 --> 03:58:53.840 align:start position:0%
of money and i think it's better spent
 
03:58:55.750 --> 03:58:55.760 align:start position:0%
if we allocate that dollar through
 
03:59:01.990 --> 03:59:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:04.870 --> 03:59:04.880 align:start position:0%
there is accountability within
 
03:59:07.670 --> 03:59:07.680 align:start position:0%
this formula which develop is developed
 
03:59:10.070 --> 03:59:10.080 align:start position:0%
for how we develop the adequacy
 
03:59:11.590 --> 03:59:11.600 align:start position:0%
education aid
 
03:59:15.030 --> 03:59:15.040 align:start position:0%
and the attic that accountability is on
 
03:59:19.269 --> 03:59:19.279 align:start position:0%
page two of the amendment under 198 40-b
 
03:59:21.189 --> 03:59:21.199 align:start position:0%
and you can read through that much of
 
03:59:23.269 --> 03:59:23.279 align:start position:0%
that language is language which came
 
03:59:26.630 --> 03:59:26.640 align:start position:0%
from the 2008 report
 
03:59:29.110 --> 03:59:29.120 align:start position:0%
so we're using similar language for
 
03:59:32.150 --> 03:59:32.160 align:start position:0%
accountability whereas the money that's
 
03:59:35.349 --> 03:59:35.359 align:start position:0%
used for this has to be used towards an
 
03:59:37.429 --> 03:59:37.439 align:start position:0%
activity or to
 
03:59:40.630 --> 03:59:40.640 align:start position:0%
helping uh attain the
 
03:59:40.640 --> 03:59:41.910 align:start position:0%
helping uh attain the
necessary

03:59:41.910 --> 03:59:41.920 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
03:59:44.309 --> 03:59:44.319 align:start position:0%
elements and needs that are associated
 
03:59:47.510 --> 03:59:47.520 align:start position:0%
with adequacy
 
03:59:49.510 --> 03:59:49.520 align:start position:0%
and as you know that we have we've
 
03:59:52.790 --> 03:59:52.800 align:start position:0%
included those components for adequacy
 
03:59:55.910 --> 03:59:55.920 align:start position:0%
and we did that the other day in hb 242.
 
03:59:58.309 --> 03:59:58.319 align:start position:0%
those are the same components
 
04:00:01.910 --> 04:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
that are within and put forth by the
 
04:00:06.070 --> 04:00:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:08.229 --> 04:00:08.239 align:start position:0%
how those components are changed in
 
04:00:10.389 --> 04:00:10.399 align:start position:0%
terms of funding is a legislative
 
04:00:12.870 --> 04:00:12.880 align:start position:0%
responsibility and i don't address that
 
04:00:14.790 --> 04:00:14.800 align:start position:0%
here in this bill that's a legislative
 
04:00:17.269 --> 04:00:17.279 align:start position:0%
responsibility to adjust those whether
 
04:00:19.429 --> 04:00:19.439 align:start position:0%
you're going to be funding a classroom
 
04:00:22.550 --> 04:00:22.560 align:start position:0%
based upon a 25 to 1 ratio or a 30 to 1
 
04:00:25.830 --> 04:00:25.840 align:start position:0%
ratio or a 20 to 1 ratio or even lower
 
04:00:27.189 --> 04:00:27.199 align:start position:0%
that is
 
04:00:29.830 --> 04:00:29.840 align:start position:0%
that's a legislative responsibility and
 
04:00:32.870 --> 04:00:32.880 align:start position:0%
both the report in 2018 that came out
 
04:00:36.070 --> 04:00:36.080 align:start position:0%
and said we are good with the ratios and
 
04:00:39.110 --> 04:00:39.120 align:start position:0%
the funding processes that for the
 
04:00:42.309 --> 04:00:42.319 align:start position:0%
components within base adequacy that
 
04:00:44.389 --> 04:00:44.399 align:start position:0%
define how we're going to achieve the
 
04:00:46.710 --> 04:00:46.720 align:start position:0%
substituent criteria for an adequate
 
04:00:46.720 --> 04:00:49.990 align:start position:0%
substituent criteria for an adequate
education

04:00:49.990 --> 04:00:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:51.670 --> 04:00:51.680 align:start position:0%
like to talk for a minute about the
 
04:00:54.710 --> 04:00:54.720 align:start position:0%
fiscal capacity component aid compel
 
04:00:57.189 --> 04:00:57.199 align:start position:0%
component because i think it's it's it's
 
04:01:00.229 --> 04:01:00.239 align:start position:0%
agreeable that we all understand
 
04:01:01.670 --> 04:01:01.680 align:start position:0%
that there is a
 
04:01:05.269 --> 04:01:05.279 align:start position:0%
a real need to assist those communities
 
04:01:07.830 --> 04:01:07.840 align:start position:0%
which represent representative smith
 
04:01:10.550 --> 04:01:10.560 align:start position:0%
and others als all spring summer and
 
04:01:12.229 --> 04:01:12.239 align:start position:0%
fall have testified before the
 
04:01:15.269 --> 04:01:15.279 align:start position:0%
commission for funding that we help the
 
04:01:18.229 --> 04:01:18.239 align:start position:0%
disparities that exist between our are
 
04:01:21.269 --> 04:01:21.279 align:start position:0%
in our schools between certain groups
 
04:01:24.070 --> 04:01:24.080 align:start position:0%
of students and between districts and
 
04:01:26.150 --> 04:01:26.160 align:start position:0%
eliminate the inequities of one district
 
04:01:28.469 --> 04:01:28.479 align:start position:0%
being able to afford the quality
 
04:01:30.710 --> 04:01:30.720 align:start position:0%
education that we and all know
 
04:01:32.469 --> 04:01:32.479 align:start position:0%
and the next district maybe not even to
 
04:01:36.550 --> 04:01:36.560 align:start position:0%
be able to afford uh ap courses
 
04:01:38.710 --> 04:01:38.720 align:start position:0%
and so we need to balance that out and
 
04:01:41.429 --> 04:01:41.439 align:start position:0%
we can do that through this portion of
 
04:01:43.349 --> 04:01:43.359 align:start position:0%
our funding formula
 
04:01:46.950 --> 04:01:46.960 align:start position:0%
and it's based upon two criteria
 
04:01:50.790 --> 04:01:50.800 align:start position:0%
the funding that came out of hb709
 
04:01:52.710 --> 04:01:52.720 align:start position:0%
used primarily equalized property
 
04:01:54.950 --> 04:01:54.960 align:start position:0%
valuation per pupil
 
04:01:57.990 --> 04:01:58.000 align:start position:0%
this formula does that but it also
 
04:02:01.590 --> 04:02:01.600 align:start position:0%
recognizes that there are communities
 
04:02:02.790 --> 04:02:02.800 align:start position:0%
which have
 
04:02:06.070 --> 04:02:06.080 align:start position:0%
high property values per pupil
 
04:02:08.150 --> 04:02:08.160 align:start position:0%
but also have
 
04:02:11.189 --> 04:02:11.199 align:start position:0%
low achievement scores or low medium
 
04:02:13.990 --> 04:02:14.000 align:start position:0%
income other words the properties are
 
04:02:17.349 --> 04:02:17.359 align:start position:0%
most likely owned or rented or leased by
 
04:02:20.150 --> 04:02:20.160 align:start position:0%
somebody's not living in that town
 
04:02:21.830 --> 04:02:21.840 align:start position:0%
however there's such a high demand you
 
04:02:24.870 --> 04:02:24.880 align:start position:0%
see the property high and the difficult
 
04:02:26.830 --> 04:02:26.840 align:start position:0%
like a lincoln new
 
04:02:30.309 --> 04:02:30.319 align:start position:0%
hampshire and so what we've got is that
 
04:02:32.469 --> 04:02:32.479 align:start position:0%
if the property value
 
04:02:32.479 --> 04:02:33.590 align:start position:0%
if the property value
is

04:02:33.590 --> 04:02:33.600 align:start position:0%
is

04:02:55.349 --> 04:02:55.359 align:start position:0%
then you would fall eligible within this
 
04:02:58.229 --> 04:02:58.239 align:start position:0%
category down to a level of four hundred
 
04:02:59.750 --> 04:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
04:03:01.110 --> 04:03:01.120 align:start position:0%
if you're at the lower end you're going
 
04:03:03.349 --> 04:03:03.359 align:start position:0%
to receive twenty five dollars per per
 
04:03:05.590 --> 04:03:05.600 align:start position:0%
student twenty five hundred dollars per
 
04:03:08.830 --> 04:03:08.840 align:start position:0%
student on top of your base
 
04:03:11.429 --> 04:03:11.439 align:start position:0%
adequacy and as you gradually get
 
04:03:14.070 --> 04:03:14.080 align:start position:0%
towards that middle point as we had in
 
04:03:16.070 --> 04:03:16.080 align:start position:0%
the bills all the bills we let dealt
 
04:03:18.870 --> 04:03:18.880 align:start position:0%
with last year the funding for that
 
04:03:21.590 --> 04:03:21.600 align:start position:0%
individual decreases
 
04:03:23.750 --> 04:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
and to the point where you get up to
 
04:03:27.750 --> 04:03:27.760 align:start position:0%
above one point i'll call it 1.14
 
04:03:30.229 --> 04:03:30.239 align:start position:0%
million dollars per pupil there is no
 
04:03:31.510 --> 04:03:31.520 align:start position:0%
extra of
 
04:03:33.510 --> 04:03:33.520 align:start position:0%
capacity aid available
 
04:03:37.429 --> 04:03:37.439 align:start position:0%
however this bill also like the 2018
 
04:03:37.439 --> 04:03:38.790 align:start position:0%
however this bill also like the 2018
report

04:03:38.790 --> 04:03:38.800 align:start position:0%
report
 
04:03:41.189 --> 04:03:41.199 align:start position:0%
only we changed it somewhat
 
04:03:43.030 --> 04:03:43.040 align:start position:0%
where there was extra support given
 
04:03:46.309 --> 04:03:46.319 align:start position:0%
based upon title 1 participation
 
04:03:48.950 --> 04:03:48.960 align:start position:0%
however that information and that data
 
04:03:51.349 --> 04:03:51.359 align:start position:0%
is not readily available from the
 
04:03:54.790 --> 04:03:54.800 align:start position:0%
department as as as well as we might
 
04:03:54.800 --> 04:03:55.670 align:start position:0%
department as as as well as we might
find

04:03:55.670 --> 04:03:55.680 align:start position:0%
find
 
04:03:55.680 --> 04:03:56.630 align:start position:0%
find
the

04:03:56.630 --> 04:03:56.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:03:58.710 --> 04:03:58.720 align:start position:0%
level one level two level three level
 
04:04:01.349 --> 04:04:01.359 align:start position:0%
four on the statewide assessment
 
04:04:03.510 --> 04:04:03.520 align:start position:0%
back in 2018
 
04:04:05.910 --> 04:04:05.920 align:start position:0%
when we were looking at this
 
04:04:08.950 --> 04:04:08.960 align:start position:0%
situation of school funding i did a
 
04:04:10.469 --> 04:04:10.479 align:start position:0%
report and presented it to that
 
04:04:13.830 --> 04:04:13.840 align:start position:0%
committee showing achievement scores
 
04:04:15.670 --> 04:04:15.680 align:start position:0%
of students which are in the lower
 
04:04:17.349 --> 04:04:17.359 align:start position:0%
quartile and the highest quartile in
 
04:04:20.389 --> 04:04:20.399 align:start position:0%
terms of equalized property valuation
 
04:04:22.710 --> 04:04:22.720 align:start position:0%
and you can imagine and guess how it
 
04:04:24.950 --> 04:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
worked the ones in the lower quartile
 
04:04:26.950 --> 04:04:26.960 align:start position:0%
had lower achievement the ones in the
 
04:04:29.910 --> 04:04:29.920 align:start position:0%
higher quartile had much higher
 
04:04:32.950 --> 04:04:32.960 align:start position:0%
achievement but there were pockets
 
04:04:34.870 --> 04:04:34.880 align:start position:0%
within both of those quartiles and
 
04:04:36.790 --> 04:04:36.800 align:start position:0%
quartiles in between
 
04:04:41.670 --> 04:04:41.680 align:start position:0%
where you had high numbers of low low l1
 
04:04:44.870 --> 04:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
and l2 level 1 and level 2 performers
 
04:04:47.110 --> 04:04:47.120 align:start position:0%
level 2 is you're not
 
04:04:50.229 --> 04:04:50.239 align:start position:0%
a proficient and level one is you're
 
04:04:52.790 --> 04:04:52.800 align:start position:0%
really not at proficient level three is
 
04:04:55.269 --> 04:04:55.279 align:start position:0%
you're for proficient and level four is
 
04:04:58.469 --> 04:04:58.479 align:start position:0%
you're way above proficiency
 
04:04:59.830 --> 04:04:59.840 align:start position:0%
and so
 
04:05:03.030 --> 04:05:03.040 align:start position:0%
the second part of this disparity aid
 
04:05:07.189 --> 04:05:07.199 align:start position:0%
program provides support to any school
 
04:05:10.070 --> 04:05:10.080 align:start position:0%
that ha above that 1.14
 
04:05:12.469 --> 04:05:12.479 align:start position:0%
million dollars that has
 
04:05:14.150 --> 04:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
for each of these students to the tune
 
04:05:17.189 --> 04:05:17.199 align:start position:0%
of fifteen hundred dollars per pupil
 
04:05:19.189 --> 04:05:19.199 align:start position:0%
so they will receive an additional for
 
04:05:21.590 --> 04:05:21.600 align:start position:0%
every child that's not
 
04:05:23.510 --> 04:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
at the level we want in terms of
 
04:05:25.910 --> 04:05:25.920 align:start position:0%
performance or and growth
 
04:05:28.830 --> 04:05:28.840 align:start position:0%
and there's a direct relationship
 
04:05:32.070 --> 04:05:32.080 align:start position:0%
between low levels and poverty are free
 
04:05:33.269 --> 04:05:33.279 align:start position:0%
and reduced
 
04:05:35.510 --> 04:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
but there are those exceptions and we
 
04:05:37.429 --> 04:05:37.439 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that all children are
 
04:05:40.150 --> 04:05:40.160 align:start position:0%
being addressed in a in a fair and in
 
04:05:42.550 --> 04:05:42.560 align:start position:0%
balanced manner so that they they
 
04:05:44.070 --> 04:05:44.080 align:start position:0%
receive the opportunity for an
 
04:05:47.429 --> 04:05:47.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:50.710 --> 04:05:50.720 align:start position:0%
so that is basically the crux of where
 
04:05:51.910 --> 04:05:51.920 align:start position:0%
we are
 
04:05:55.510 --> 04:05:55.520 align:start position:0%
um one of the amended analysis in the
 
04:05:57.429 --> 04:05:57.439 align:start position:0%
this report
 
04:05:59.189 --> 04:05:59.199 align:start position:0%
indicates it says
 
04:06:01.590 --> 04:06:01.600 align:start position:0%
it increases the base per pupil cost for
 
04:06:04.550 --> 04:06:04.560 align:start position:0%
inadequate education by way of cpi
 
04:06:06.389 --> 04:06:06.399 align:start position:0%
two increases differentiate
 
04:06:08.309 --> 04:06:08.319 align:start position:0%
differentiated aid available to eligible
 
04:06:08.319 --> 04:06:09.429 align:start position:0%
differentiated aid available to eligible
pupils

04:06:09.429 --> 04:06:09.439 align:start position:0%
pupils
 
04:06:11.910 --> 04:06:11.920 align:start position:0%
attac establishes fiscal capacity
 
04:06:14.870 --> 04:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
disparity aid to municipalities based on
 
04:06:17.189 --> 04:06:17.199 align:start position:0%
property valuation and
 
04:06:19.110 --> 04:06:19.120 align:start position:0%
student proficiency
 
04:06:21.110 --> 04:06:21.120 align:start position:0%
so there's two levels there
 
04:06:22.790 --> 04:06:22.800 align:start position:0%
and number three requires school
 
04:06:24.229 --> 04:06:24.239 align:start position:0%
districts to report on the use of
 
04:06:26.389 --> 04:06:26.399 align:start position:0%
adequate education grant funds
 
04:06:28.630 --> 04:06:28.640 align:start position:0%
and men's amends the law governing
 
04:06:31.110 --> 04:06:31.120 align:start position:0%
transportation of pupils in kindergarten
 
04:06:34.150 --> 04:06:34.160 align:start position:0%
through grade 12. we have always funded
 
04:06:36.469 --> 04:06:36.479 align:start position:0%
transportation by the way in the base
 
04:06:38.790 --> 04:06:38.800 align:start position:0%
adequacy formula
 
04:06:41.990 --> 04:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
so that will con that continues
 
04:06:43.990 --> 04:06:44.000 align:start position:0%
and it repeals of course anything to do
 
04:06:47.349 --> 04:06:47.359 align:start position:0%
with stabilization so mr chairman that's
 
04:06:49.349 --> 04:06:49.359 align:start position:0%
a quick summary
 
04:06:50.710 --> 04:06:50.720 align:start position:0%
of this bill
 
04:06:52.830 --> 04:06:52.840 align:start position:0%
uh the difference between this bill for
 
04:06:54.710 --> 04:06:54.720 align:start position:0%
example and
 
04:06:56.469 --> 04:06:56.479 align:start position:0%
where we were on the funding commission
 
04:06:58.710 --> 04:06:58.720 align:start position:0%
which i was a member and of course i was
 
04:07:01.910 --> 04:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
one that objected to the report and not
 
04:07:04.950 --> 04:07:04.960 align:start position:0%
all the report there's many real
 
04:07:07.030 --> 04:07:07.040 align:start position:0%
wonderful aspects of the report provided
 
04:07:10.309 --> 04:07:10.319 align:start position:0%
in terms of the need to help youngsters
 
04:07:12.790 --> 04:07:12.800 align:start position:0%
in our state all have the opportunity
 
04:07:12.800 --> 04:07:13.510 align:start position:0%
in our state all have the opportunity
for

04:07:13.510 --> 04:07:13.520 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:07:16.870 --> 04:07:16.880 align:start position:0%
that education we really recognize as as
 
04:07:19.110 --> 04:07:19.120 align:start position:0%
what we call adequate
 
04:07:21.510 --> 04:07:21.520 align:start position:0%
the bill we had 242 really defines
 
04:07:23.670 --> 04:07:23.680 align:start position:0%
adequacy the elements that are part of
 
04:07:23.680 --> 04:07:24.309 align:start position:0%
adequacy the elements that are part of
it

04:07:24.309 --> 04:07:24.319 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:07:26.389 --> 04:07:26.399 align:start position:0%
but this formula
 
04:07:28.550 --> 04:07:28.560 align:start position:0%
costs those out it's an input-based
 
04:07:31.269 --> 04:07:31.279 align:start position:0%
model rather than the model which came
 
04:07:33.429 --> 04:07:33.439 align:start position:0%
out of the commission is a performance
 
04:07:35.429 --> 04:07:35.439 align:start position:0%
outcome based model
 
04:07:38.469 --> 04:07:38.479 align:start position:0%
based upon our total spending and that's
 
04:07:41.670 --> 04:07:41.680 align:start position:0%
derived from the doe 25 form so we take
 
04:07:44.710 --> 04:07:44.720 align:start position:0%
the average cost there of a child
 
04:07:47.510 --> 04:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
and then we try to provide that level of
 
04:07:50.070 --> 04:07:50.080 align:start position:0%
funding seeing that our state is on the
 
04:07:52.389 --> 04:07:52.399 align:start position:0%
in the top five always in terms of
 
04:07:54.229 --> 04:07:54.239 align:start position:0%
achievement in this country so we're
 
04:07:56.150 --> 04:07:56.160 align:start position:0%
using that as a gauge
 
04:07:56.160 --> 04:07:57.030 align:start position:0%
using that as a gauge
and

04:07:57.030 --> 04:07:57.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:07:59.670 --> 04:07:59.680 align:start position:0%
then the the amount that has to be
 
04:08:02.070 --> 04:08:02.080 align:start position:0%
raised to get to that level
 
04:08:04.389 --> 04:08:04.399 align:start position:0%
is distributed according to
 
04:08:07.269 --> 04:08:07.279 align:start position:0%
where the the weighted needs are in
 
04:08:10.630 --> 04:08:10.640 align:start position:0%
differentiated aid and base adequacy
 
04:08:12.710 --> 04:08:12.720 align:start position:0%
this base adequacy and the bill you have
 
04:08:14.229 --> 04:08:14.239 align:start position:0%
in front of you today
 
04:08:17.189 --> 04:08:17.199 align:start position:0%
maintains it and only increases at the
 
04:08:17.199 --> 04:08:18.389 align:start position:0%
maintains it and only increases at the
cpi

04:08:18.389 --> 04:08:18.399 align:start position:0%
cpi
 
04:08:21.110 --> 04:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
where the other formula increases and
 
04:08:23.189 --> 04:08:23.199 align:start position:0%
jumps it to approximately a little less
 
04:08:25.830 --> 04:08:25.840 align:start position:0%
than six thousand dollars per student
 
04:08:28.469 --> 04:08:28.479 align:start position:0%
but then in terms of differentiated aid
 
04:08:30.309 --> 04:08:30.319 align:start position:0%
giving weights out
 
04:08:32.630 --> 04:08:32.640 align:start position:0%
it weights a special education student
 
04:08:36.870 --> 04:08:36.880 align:start position:0%
for example at 4.2 times the base
 
04:08:39.110 --> 04:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
plus that base
 
04:08:39.120 --> 04:08:40.150 align:start position:0%
plus that base
and

04:08:40.150 --> 04:08:40.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:08:43.189 --> 04:08:43.199 align:start position:0%
that that to me leaves some room for
 
04:08:45.910 --> 04:08:45.920 align:start position:0%
discussion that a kid that's in special
 
04:08:48.229 --> 04:08:48.239 align:start position:0%
ed for only a half hour a week
 
04:08:50.630 --> 04:08:50.640 align:start position:0%
is going to get funded that at that rate
 
04:08:52.550 --> 04:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
if you change that weighted amount
 
04:08:53.670 --> 04:08:53.680 align:start position:0%
you're going to have to increase the
 
04:08:55.670 --> 04:08:55.680 align:start position:0%
weighted amount somewhere else you've
 
04:08:57.910 --> 04:08:57.920 align:start position:0%
got to come up with this average
 
04:09:00.469 --> 04:09:00.479 align:start position:0%
and it's not based upon the inputs it's
 
04:09:04.309 --> 04:09:04.319 align:start position:0%
based upon that output based on doe 25
 
04:09:06.790 --> 04:09:06.800 align:start position:0%
forms as submitted by the school
 
04:09:08.950 --> 04:09:08.960 align:start position:0%
districts which include
 
04:09:11.269 --> 04:09:11.279 align:start position:0%
all kinds of components
 
04:09:14.630 --> 04:09:14.640 align:start position:0%
that are not part of adequacy
 
04:09:17.750 --> 04:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
so in conclusion this does conclude my
 
04:09:20.469 --> 04:09:20.479 align:start position:0%
report and and describes the amendment
 
04:09:22.469 --> 04:09:22.479 align:start position:0%
in a a brief way
 
04:09:24.950 --> 04:09:24.960 align:start position:0%
uh of where where this goes in terms of
 
04:09:26.870 --> 04:09:26.880 align:start position:0%
the costing of an education funding
 
04:09:29.990 --> 04:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
formula thank you very much mr chair
 
04:09:31.750 --> 04:09:31.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
04:09:34.229 --> 04:09:34.239 align:start position:0%
i see representative baum has his
 
04:09:34.239 --> 04:09:39.030 align:start position:0%
i see representative baum has his
handout

04:09:39.030 --> 04:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:41.349 --> 04:09:41.359 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker and thank you
 
04:09:43.429 --> 04:09:43.439 align:start position:0%
representative left taking the question
 
04:09:44.870 --> 04:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
uh since
 
04:09:47.349 --> 04:09:47.359 align:start position:0%
2005 6 when i'm here we've been voting
 
04:09:49.189 --> 04:09:49.199 align:start position:0%
on a lot of different
 
04:09:51.030 --> 04:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
education funding
 
04:09:52.710 --> 04:09:52.720 align:start position:0%
but one of the things we've always had
 
04:09:55.030 --> 04:09:55.040 align:start position:0%
is a spreadsheet showing
 
04:09:57.349 --> 04:09:57.359 align:start position:0%
how your town will make money or lose
 
04:10:01.990 --> 04:10:02.000 align:start position:0%
money and i don't think this will pass
 
04:10:03.910 --> 04:10:03.920 align:start position:0%
when we go to the full house unless we
 
04:10:06.630 --> 04:10:06.640 align:start position:0%
have that spreadsheet because i know for
 
04:10:08.710 --> 04:10:08.720 align:start position:0%
one i am not going to vote for any
 
04:10:11.670 --> 04:10:11.680 align:start position:0%
education funding where my town loses a
 
04:10:14.550 --> 04:10:14.560 align:start position:0%
lot of money or much money so i think
 
04:10:16.630 --> 04:10:16.640 align:start position:0%
that's always been the issue
 
04:10:18.389 --> 04:10:18.399 align:start position:0%
so will we have
 
04:10:20.309 --> 04:10:20.319 align:start position:0%
a spreadsheet showing
 
04:10:22.950 --> 04:10:22.960 align:start position:0%
comparison of town data
 
04:10:25.030 --> 04:10:25.040 align:start position:0%
now and with this bill
 
04:10:25.040 --> 04:10:25.990 align:start position:0%
now and with this bill
yes

04:10:25.990 --> 04:10:26.000 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:10:30.710 --> 04:10:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:34.389 --> 04:10:34.399 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh representative luno
 
04:10:36.309 --> 04:10:36.319 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair and thank
 
04:10:38.150 --> 04:10:38.160 align:start position:0%
you very much representative ladd for
 
04:10:40.870 --> 04:10:40.880 align:start position:0%
for presenting um 608
 
04:10:43.030 --> 04:10:43.040 align:start position:0%
and i think there's uh there's there's
 
04:10:45.750 --> 04:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
probably some very good good pieces in
 
04:10:48.229 --> 04:10:48.239 align:start position:0%
it and i'll be looking forward to the um
 
04:10:49.670 --> 04:10:49.680 align:start position:0%
to seeing the
 
04:10:51.590 --> 04:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
the department's fiscal
 
04:10:52.870 --> 04:10:52.880 align:start position:0%
note on this
 
04:10:54.950 --> 04:10:54.960 align:start position:0%
tomorrow but um
 
04:10:56.870 --> 04:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
and so much as you talked about some of
 
04:10:58.710 --> 04:10:58.720 align:start position:0%
the the commission's work in
 
04:10:58.720 --> 04:11:00.469 align:start position:0%
the the commission's work in
particularly

04:11:00.469 --> 04:11:00.479 align:start position:0%
particularly
 
04:11:02.229 --> 04:11:02.239 align:start position:0%
how the how the commission's
 
04:11:04.389 --> 04:11:04.399 align:start position:0%
recommendations calculate the cost of an
 
04:11:07.189 --> 04:11:07.199 align:start position:0%
adequate education based on based on
 
04:11:08.630 --> 04:11:08.640 align:start position:0%
student performance
 
04:11:10.550 --> 04:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
wasn't quite out it wasn't quite
 
04:11:13.269 --> 04:11:13.279 align:start position:0%
accurate and um and i was wondering when
 
04:11:15.189 --> 04:11:15.199 align:start position:0%
we might have an opportunity
 
04:11:16.950 --> 04:11:16.960 align:start position:0%
um uh well of course there is an
 
04:11:19.349 --> 04:11:19.359 align:start position:0%
opportunity coming up next monday
 
04:11:22.790 --> 04:11:22.800 align:start position:0%
february 22nd at 2 p.m on zoom
 
04:11:24.630 --> 04:11:24.640 align:start position:0%
it's a notice in the house and senate
 
04:11:26.389 --> 04:11:26.399 align:start position:0%
calendars for a
 
04:11:27.510 --> 04:11:27.520 align:start position:0%
for a
 
04:11:29.110 --> 04:11:29.120 align:start position:0%
briefing of all representative
 
04:11:29.120 --> 04:11:30.389 align:start position:0%
briefing of all representative
legislators

04:11:30.389 --> 04:11:30.399 align:start position:0%
legislators
 
04:11:32.790 --> 04:11:32.800 align:start position:0%
to the commission report but i guess
 
04:11:36.870 --> 04:11:36.880 align:start position:0%
wondering when we may be able to to um
 
04:11:36.880 --> 04:11:37.590 align:start position:0%
wondering when we may be able to to um
and

04:11:37.590 --> 04:11:37.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:11:39.990 --> 04:11:40.000 align:start position:0%
maybe it's after we get through this
 
04:11:42.550 --> 04:11:42.560 align:start position:0%
early this plug of early bills
 
04:11:45.030 --> 04:11:45.040 align:start position:0%
when we might be able to um to have a
 
04:11:47.429 --> 04:11:47.439 align:start position:0%
zoom session with the house education
 
04:11:50.790 --> 04:11:50.800 align:start position:0%
committee to really um you know dig down
 
04:11:53.429 --> 04:11:53.439 align:start position:0%
into uh
 
04:11:56.469 --> 04:11:56.479 align:start position:0%
what's what really goes into an outcome
 
04:11:58.550 --> 04:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
or student performance
 
04:12:01.269 --> 04:12:01.279 align:start position:0%
driven costing formula
 
04:12:02.309 --> 04:12:02.319 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much
 
04:12:05.510 --> 04:12:05.520 align:start position:0%
representative luno and i i
 
04:12:08.309 --> 04:12:08.319 align:start position:0%
i know that you and i both
 
04:12:10.790 --> 04:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
want the best for our kids in this state
 
04:12:14.469 --> 04:12:14.479 align:start position:0%
and so i'm very open to a presentation
 
04:12:17.030 --> 04:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
as i mentioned to represent mylar
 
04:12:19.990 --> 04:12:20.000 align:start position:0%
a week ago or a couple weeks ago
 
04:12:24.389 --> 04:12:24.399 align:start position:0%
that it i i would welcome that uh to
 
04:12:27.910 --> 04:12:27.920 align:start position:0%
occur with our education committee um
 
04:12:29.990 --> 04:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
and i mentioned then i'd like to have
 
04:12:31.510 --> 04:12:31.520 align:start position:0%
that done after
 
04:12:33.830 --> 04:12:33.840 align:start position:0%
the busy schedule we're in right now
 
04:12:36.870 --> 04:12:36.880 align:start position:0%
and it'd be after thursday this week
 
04:12:39.830 --> 04:12:39.840 align:start position:0%
then and i'd be glad then to coordinate
 
04:12:41.750 --> 04:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
a time with you
 
04:12:43.670 --> 04:12:43.680 align:start position:0%
um seeing you were the chair of that
 
04:12:46.469 --> 04:12:46.479 align:start position:0%
particular commission and represent
 
04:12:49.110 --> 04:12:49.120 align:start position:0%
milor the ranking uh democrat on our
 
04:12:51.510 --> 04:12:51.520 align:start position:0%
committee right now um i think we need
 
04:12:53.910 --> 04:12:53.920 align:start position:0%
to have an open discussion i think we
 
04:12:56.150 --> 04:12:56.160 align:start position:0%
need to have a fair discussion
 
04:12:58.870 --> 04:12:58.880 align:start position:0%
uh one of which um
 
04:13:02.309 --> 04:13:02.319 align:start position:0%
is driving towards the same end to
 
04:13:05.110 --> 04:13:05.120 align:start position:0%
have a fiscally responsible
 
04:13:05.120 --> 04:13:06.149 align:start position:0%
have a fiscally responsible
outcome

04:13:06.149 --> 04:13:06.159 align:start position:0%
outcome
 
04:13:09.510 --> 04:13:09.520 align:start position:0%
that con that best serves these kids and
 
04:13:11.030 --> 04:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
these towns where we have these
 
04:13:12.870 --> 04:13:12.880 align:start position:0%
inequities in disparity i don't think
 
04:13:16.309 --> 04:13:16.319 align:start position:0%
anybody dave is is questioning that we
 
04:13:18.149 --> 04:13:18.159 align:start position:0%
don't have these disparities in these
 
04:13:20.389 --> 04:13:20.399 align:start position:0%
inequities i think where we are right
 
04:13:23.429 --> 04:13:23.439 align:start position:0%
now is at least where i am it's just how
 
04:13:24.309 --> 04:13:24.319 align:start position:0%
do we
 
04:13:27.189 --> 04:13:27.199 align:start position:0%
how do we raise that revenue and and
 
04:13:31.030 --> 04:13:31.040 align:start position:0%
and how do we account for those needs uh
 
04:13:33.429 --> 04:13:33.439 align:start position:0%
through our funding formula
 
04:13:35.510 --> 04:13:35.520 align:start position:0%
great great well happy to work with you
 
04:13:37.110 --> 04:13:37.120 align:start position:0%
on getting that set up
 
04:13:39.910 --> 04:13:39.920 align:start position:0%
yep be pleased to do that great thank
 
04:13:42.070 --> 04:13:42.080 align:start position:0%
you representative milor
 
04:13:44.229 --> 04:13:44.239 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman and let me just
 
04:13:45.910 --> 04:13:45.920 align:start position:0%
follow up with what
 
04:13:47.349 --> 04:13:47.359 align:start position:0%
dave was saying
 
04:13:50.550 --> 04:13:50.560 align:start position:0%
uh let me be real clear about
 
04:13:53.189 --> 04:13:53.199 align:start position:0%
my issue on this and that is
 
04:13:57.189 --> 04:13:57.199 align:start position:0%
i am i'm not a um
 
04:14:00.229 --> 04:14:00.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:02.870 --> 04:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
a fact sheet guy i mean i i i have a
 
04:14:06.389 --> 04:14:06.399 align:start position:0%
hard time looking at um
 
04:14:06.399 --> 04:14:09.189 align:start position:0%
hard time looking at um
uh

04:14:09.189 --> 04:14:09.199 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:14:11.030 --> 04:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
information that's that's on a
 
04:14:11.040 --> 04:14:12.389 align:start position:0%
information that's that's on a
spreadsheet

04:14:12.389 --> 04:14:12.399 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet
 
04:14:15.750 --> 04:14:15.760 align:start position:0%
um some people like spreadsheets i i
 
04:14:18.229 --> 04:14:18.239 align:start position:0%
in all candor i maybe it's because of my
 
04:14:19.750 --> 04:14:19.760 align:start position:0%
age but i
 
04:14:21.990 --> 04:14:22.000 align:start position:0%
dave lunos never met a spreadsheet he
 
04:14:23.830 --> 04:14:23.840 align:start position:0%
hasn't loved all right
 
04:14:25.990 --> 04:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
that's not me but what i was concerned
 
04:14:27.670 --> 04:14:27.680 align:start position:0%
about when we got into this funding
 
04:14:27.680 --> 04:14:28.710 align:start position:0%
about when we got into this funding
thing

04:14:28.710 --> 04:14:28.720 align:start position:0%
thing
 
04:14:32.229 --> 04:14:32.239 align:start position:0%
was how is this done
 
04:14:34.790 --> 04:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
and what what you have before you and i
 
04:14:37.189 --> 04:14:37.199 align:start position:0%
think what you're going to learn
 
04:14:39.189 --> 04:14:39.199 align:start position:0%
is the two different ways
 
04:14:42.630 --> 04:14:42.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:44.870 --> 04:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
rick has basically proposed here a
 
04:14:44.880 --> 04:14:46.630 align:start position:0%
rick has basically proposed here a
continuation

04:14:46.630 --> 04:14:46.640 align:start position:0%
continuation
 
04:14:48.950 --> 04:14:48.960 align:start position:0%
of an input model
 
04:14:52.229 --> 04:14:52.239 align:start position:0%
and an input model was created back when
 
04:14:53.990 --> 04:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
it's been one we've been using and what
 
04:14:55.990 --> 04:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
we mean by an input
 
04:14:58.870 --> 04:14:58.880 align:start position:0%
it's more of an accounting model
 
04:15:01.429 --> 04:15:01.439 align:start position:0%
in essence what does it cost
 
04:15:03.429 --> 04:15:03.439 align:start position:0%
for an average teacher salary what's it
 
04:15:05.830 --> 04:15:05.840 align:start position:0%
cost for an average principal what's a
 
04:15:05.840 --> 04:15:07.189 align:start position:0%
cost for an average principal what's a
cost

04:15:07.189 --> 04:15:07.199 align:start position:0%
cost
 
04:15:09.590 --> 04:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
for internet i mean it's it's a thing
 
04:15:12.070 --> 04:15:12.080 align:start position:0%
kind of costing
 
04:15:13.990 --> 04:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
and that's what we had forever because
 
04:15:15.750 --> 04:15:15.760 align:start position:0%
we never had
 
04:15:18.550 --> 04:15:18.560 align:start position:0%
the ability to really look at student
 
04:15:18.560 --> 04:15:20.870 align:start position:0%
the ability to really look at student
performance

04:15:20.870 --> 04:15:20.880 align:start position:0%
performance
 
04:15:23.830 --> 04:15:23.840 align:start position:0%
we have that ability now
 
04:15:25.910 --> 04:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
with the various metrics
 
04:15:27.269 --> 04:15:27.279 align:start position:0%
that we have
 
04:15:31.189 --> 04:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
from kids who take exams etc
 
04:15:33.429 --> 04:15:33.439 align:start position:0%
we now can target
 
04:15:35.830 --> 04:15:35.840 align:start position:0%
where students are doing who are the
 
04:15:38.950 --> 04:15:38.960 align:start position:0%
performance of students across the state
 
04:15:41.670 --> 04:15:41.680 align:start position:0%
and what the commission found
 
04:15:44.870 --> 04:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
was that in those low poverty areas
 
04:15:47.110 --> 04:15:47.120 align:start position:0%
it was very clear
 
04:15:49.750 --> 04:15:49.760 align:start position:0%
that students in those low poverty areas
 
04:15:51.670 --> 04:15:51.680 align:start position:0%
were not
 
04:15:51.680 --> 04:15:52.790 align:start position:0%
were not
able

04:15:52.790 --> 04:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
able
 
04:15:54.790 --> 04:15:54.800 align:start position:0%
to receive the same kind of an
 
04:15:57.189 --> 04:15:57.199 align:start position:0%
educational opportunity as those are the
 
04:15:59.189 --> 04:15:59.199 align:start position:0%
more wealthy ones
 
04:16:01.030 --> 04:16:01.040 align:start position:0%
and so the commission began to look
 
04:16:03.269 --> 04:16:03.279 align:start position:0%
without getting into the specifics of it
 
04:16:05.189 --> 04:16:05.199 align:start position:0%
but the commission began to look at a
 
04:16:07.030 --> 04:16:07.040 align:start position:0%
different way
 
04:16:09.189 --> 04:16:09.199 align:start position:0%
of funding schools
 
04:16:11.510 --> 04:16:11.520 align:start position:0%
where you could take the performance of
 
04:16:11.520 --> 04:16:14.070 align:start position:0%
where you could take the performance of
students

04:16:14.070 --> 04:16:14.080 align:start position:0%
students
 
04:16:16.950 --> 04:16:16.960 align:start position:0%
and see where they were and provide
 
04:16:16.960 --> 04:16:18.149 align:start position:0%
and see where they were and provide
additional

04:16:18.149 --> 04:16:18.159 align:start position:0%
additional
 
04:16:18.159 --> 04:16:19.429 align:start position:0%
additional
dollars

04:16:19.429 --> 04:16:19.439 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
04:16:21.990 --> 04:16:22.000 align:start position:0%
into those school districts
 
04:16:24.389 --> 04:16:24.399 align:start position:0%
to help them attain a higher level of
 
04:16:24.399 --> 04:16:25.750 align:start position:0%
to help them attain a higher level of
performance

04:16:25.750 --> 04:16:25.760 align:start position:0%
performance
 
04:16:28.550 --> 04:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
that's the outcome based model
 
04:16:30.710 --> 04:16:30.720 align:start position:0%
and those are the two models that that
 
04:16:33.110 --> 04:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
are out there right now the traditional
 
04:16:36.070 --> 04:16:36.080 align:start position:0%
input which rick is talking about
 
04:16:38.710 --> 04:16:38.720 align:start position:0%
and the outcome base the on the outcome
 
04:16:40.870 --> 04:16:40.880 align:start position:0%
base is not only student
 
04:16:42.469 --> 04:16:42.479 align:start position:0%
test scores
 
04:16:45.590 --> 04:16:45.600 align:start position:0%
but the level of which students perform
 
04:16:47.750 --> 04:16:47.760 align:start position:0%
as they graduate and don't forget
 
04:16:49.830 --> 04:16:49.840 align:start position:0%
graduation standards
 
04:16:52.790 --> 04:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
are created at the local level
 
04:16:55.429 --> 04:16:55.439 align:start position:0%
so if a student graduates it means that
 
04:16:58.870 --> 04:16:58.880 align:start position:0%
they have in essence met that standard
 
04:17:00.950 --> 04:17:00.960 align:start position:0%
so those are the two different ways that
 
04:17:03.830 --> 04:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
we are looking at performing
 
04:17:05.750 --> 04:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
funding of schools one is the
 
04:17:08.710 --> 04:17:08.720 align:start position:0%
traditional input the other is tradition
 
04:17:10.550 --> 04:17:10.560 align:start position:0%
is a new way of looking at taking
 
04:17:12.309 --> 04:17:12.319 align:start position:0%
existing monies
 
04:17:15.110 --> 04:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
we're not talking about new revenues but
 
04:17:17.349 --> 04:17:17.359 align:start position:0%
existing monies
 
04:17:17.359 --> 04:17:18.389 align:start position:0%
existing monies
and

04:17:18.389 --> 04:17:18.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:17:21.189 --> 04:17:21.199 align:start position:0%
making a fair allocation of that state
 
04:17:25.590 --> 04:17:25.600 align:start position:0%
monies to locals that are really in need
 
04:17:27.269 --> 04:17:27.279 align:start position:0%
and that's what you begin to hear about
 
04:17:28.870 --> 04:17:28.880 align:start position:0%
that's what we'll talk about
 
04:17:30.870 --> 04:17:30.880 align:start position:0%
at the briefing session next week and
 
04:17:33.349 --> 04:17:33.359 align:start position:0%
then follow up with what rick was saying
 
04:17:35.429 --> 04:17:35.439 align:start position:0%
earlier but i just wanted to point out
 
04:17:37.030 --> 04:17:37.040 align:start position:0%
to the committee because when i first
 
04:17:38.389 --> 04:17:38.399 align:start position:0%
got on this committee i didn't have a
 
04:17:38.399 --> 04:17:39.670 align:start position:0%
got on this committee i didn't have a
clue

04:17:39.670 --> 04:17:39.680 align:start position:0%
clue
 
04:17:41.349 --> 04:17:41.359 align:start position:0%
how this stuff was done
 
04:17:42.950 --> 04:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
i have a little better understanding of
 
04:17:44.870 --> 04:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
it now and i just wanted to kind of
 
04:17:48.389 --> 04:17:48.399 align:start position:0%
share those two options with you now
 
04:17:49.349 --> 04:17:49.359 align:start position:0%
can i
 
04:17:53.030 --> 04:17:53.040 align:start position:0%
yes please uh please represent no i i
 
04:17:55.510 --> 04:17:55.520 align:start position:0%
think uh representative miler is
 
04:17:55.520 --> 04:17:56.389 align:start position:0%
think uh representative miler is
uh

04:17:56.389 --> 04:17:56.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:17:59.590 --> 04:17:59.600 align:start position:0%
on the track that um
 
04:18:02.550 --> 04:18:02.560 align:start position:0%
that i think we all can enjoy or
 
04:18:02.560 --> 04:18:03.670 align:start position:0%
that i think we all can enjoy or
appreciate

04:18:03.670 --> 04:18:03.680 align:start position:0%
appreciate
 
04:18:03.680 --> 04:18:04.710 align:start position:0%
appreciate
um

04:18:04.710 --> 04:18:04.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:18:06.469 --> 04:18:06.479 align:start position:0%
one thing i want to really clarify
 
04:18:08.870 --> 04:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
though that i believe input is extremely
 
04:18:12.309 --> 04:18:12.319 align:start position:0%
important and i i think our identifying
 
04:18:15.269 --> 04:18:15.279 align:start position:0%
specifics and in terms of unadequate
 
04:18:15.279 --> 04:18:16.550 align:start position:0%
specifics and in terms of unadequate
education

04:18:16.550 --> 04:18:16.560 align:start position:0%
education
 
04:18:18.710 --> 04:18:18.720 align:start position:0%
of those necessary key elements to
 
04:18:22.070 --> 04:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
attain that those knowledge domains but
 
04:18:24.469 --> 04:18:24.479 align:start position:0%
i also believe that we have another
 
04:18:24.479 --> 04:18:25.590 align:start position:0%
i also believe that we have another
component

04:18:25.590 --> 04:18:25.600 align:start position:0%
component
 
04:18:28.389 --> 04:18:28.399 align:start position:0%
performance outcomes which we measure
 
04:18:30.630 --> 04:18:30.640 align:start position:0%
so i think you need both
 
04:18:34.309 --> 04:18:34.319 align:start position:0%
and why i say that is that
 
04:18:37.269 --> 04:18:37.279 align:start position:0%
um we we want students that graduate
 
04:18:38.790 --> 04:18:38.800 align:start position:0%
from high school here to be able to
 
04:18:41.750 --> 04:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
apply that knowledge and that's that's a
 
04:18:43.750 --> 04:18:43.760 align:start position:0%
a a
 
04:18:46.149 --> 04:18:46.159 align:start position:0%
an element which is kind of relatively
 
04:18:48.550 --> 04:18:48.560 align:start position:0%
new in terms of our terminology and how
 
04:18:50.870 --> 04:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
we address education we've always
 
04:18:53.269 --> 04:18:53.279 align:start position:0%
measured it solely from achievement but
 
04:18:55.670 --> 04:18:55.680 align:start position:0%
we have to also apply that
 
04:18:57.349 --> 04:18:57.359 align:start position:0%
knowledge somehow
 
04:18:57.359 --> 04:18:58.229 align:start position:0%
knowledge somehow
and

04:18:58.229 --> 04:18:58.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:19:00.149 --> 04:19:00.159 align:start position:0%
this is an issue that came out of the
 
04:19:03.269 --> 04:19:03.279 align:start position:0%
funding commission and uh
 
04:19:05.269 --> 04:19:05.279 align:start position:0%
not just the funding commission but out
 
04:19:07.510 --> 04:19:07.520 align:start position:0%
of the advisory commission for queer
 
04:19:09.349 --> 04:19:09.359 align:start position:0%
technical education
 
04:19:09.359 --> 04:19:10.469 align:start position:0%
technical education
that

04:19:10.469 --> 04:19:10.479 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:19:10.479 --> 04:19:11.269 align:start position:0%
that
these

04:19:11.269 --> 04:19:11.279 align:start position:0%
these
 
04:19:13.830 --> 04:19:13.840 align:start position:0%
if you look at cte programs
 
04:19:17.030 --> 04:19:17.040 align:start position:0%
three of the 14 key indicators of a
 
04:19:19.349 --> 04:19:19.359 align:start position:0%
student being able to be ready to
 
04:19:22.790 --> 04:19:22.800 align:start position:0%
graduate and receive that are based upon
 
04:19:25.110 --> 04:19:25.120 align:start position:0%
cte type indicators
 
04:19:27.750 --> 04:19:27.760 align:start position:0%
so when i look at the the group right
 
04:19:30.630 --> 04:19:30.640 align:start position:0%
here number four which is in the top
 
04:19:33.990 --> 04:19:34.000 align:start position:0%
quartile in terms of property valuations
 
04:19:36.229 --> 04:19:36.239 align:start position:0%
i see 60 percent
 
04:19:38.870 --> 04:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
of our kids are achieving on a
 
04:19:41.189 --> 04:19:41.199 align:start position:0%
proficient or above level
 
04:19:42.950 --> 04:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
but in those communities and these are
 
04:19:45.030 --> 04:19:45.040 align:start position:0%
the wealthy communities
 
04:19:47.269 --> 04:19:47.279 align:start position:0%
i'm seeing forty percent of the kids
 
04:19:50.389 --> 04:19:50.399 align:start position:0%
still at level one and level two
 
04:19:52.710 --> 04:19:52.720 align:start position:0%
this is why i've made an effort in this
 
04:19:55.110 --> 04:19:55.120 align:start position:0%
particular bill to also provide support
 
04:19:56.309 --> 04:19:56.319 align:start position:0%
and funding
 
04:19:58.630 --> 04:19:58.640 align:start position:0%
to those level two one and twos
 
04:20:01.910 --> 04:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
regardless of the quartile they may be
 
04:20:01.920 --> 04:20:02.790 align:start position:0%
regardless of the quartile they may be
in

04:20:02.790 --> 04:20:02.800 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:20:05.670 --> 04:20:05.680 align:start position:0%
so i i look forward uh represent mylar
 
04:20:08.229 --> 04:20:08.239 align:start position:0%
and represent luna to this discussion
 
04:20:11.750 --> 04:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
um we have a long way to go as a state
 
04:20:14.790 --> 04:20:14.800 align:start position:0%
in in funding our our education process
 
04:20:17.030 --> 04:20:17.040 align:start position:0%
correctly and ensuring that the dollars
 
04:20:19.429 --> 04:20:19.439 align:start position:0%
we are funding are used for those
 
04:20:21.429 --> 04:20:21.439 align:start position:0%
particular tasks which we hope to
 
04:20:23.910 --> 04:20:23.920 align:start position:0%
achieve with kids
 
04:20:24.950 --> 04:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:20:27.670 --> 04:20:27.680 align:start position:0%
representative moffett
 
04:20:30.630 --> 04:20:30.640 align:start position:0%
uh yeah thank you mr chair uh
 
04:20:32.389 --> 04:20:32.399 align:start position:0%
question is for representative vlad or
 
04:20:34.870 --> 04:20:34.880 align:start position:0%
representative miler or anyone
 
04:20:38.229 --> 04:20:38.239 align:start position:0%
uh is is anyone else concerned that the
 
04:20:41.030 --> 04:20:41.040 align:start position:0%
the notion of targeting districts with
 
04:20:43.030 --> 04:20:43.040 align:start position:0%
low test scores creates a little bit of
 
04:20:47.269 --> 04:20:47.279 align:start position:0%
a perverse incentive to to not do well
 
04:20:47.279 --> 04:20:48.309 align:start position:0%
a perverse incentive to to not do well
uh

04:20:48.309 --> 04:20:48.319 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:20:50.149 --> 04:20:50.159 align:start position:0%
in other words if if you don't do well
 
04:20:53.030 --> 04:20:53.040 align:start position:0%
you get more money is that a
 
04:20:56.149 --> 04:20:56.159 align:start position:0%
concern to anyone else
 
04:20:58.070 --> 04:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
well i think one of i think one of the
 
04:21:00.389 --> 04:21:00.399 align:start position:0%
issues if i may rick
 
04:21:02.630 --> 04:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
one of the issues uh mike that we need
 
04:21:05.110 --> 04:21:05.120 align:start position:0%
to look at
 
04:21:08.469 --> 04:21:08.479 align:start position:0%
is we can we can worry about just our
 
04:21:08.479 --> 04:21:09.910 align:start position:0%
is we can we can worry about just our
kids

04:21:09.910 --> 04:21:09.920 align:start position:0%
kids
 
04:21:12.149 --> 04:21:12.159 align:start position:0%
in our community right
 
04:21:13.830 --> 04:21:13.840 align:start position:0%
but yet on the other hand we then
 
04:21:15.189 --> 04:21:15.199 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be talking about workforce
 
04:21:17.750 --> 04:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
development across the state
 
04:21:19.349 --> 04:21:19.359 align:start position:0%
because we should be worried about all
 
04:21:22.149 --> 04:21:22.159 align:start position:0%
the kids in the state
 
04:21:23.189 --> 04:21:23.199 align:start position:0%
and one of the things that the
 
04:21:25.910 --> 04:21:25.920 align:start position:0%
commission was focusing on
 
04:21:28.710 --> 04:21:28.720 align:start position:0%
the issue that you raised was how do we
 
04:21:31.910 --> 04:21:31.920 align:start position:0%
begin to make sure that every child has
 
04:21:34.469 --> 04:21:34.479 align:start position:0%
an equal educational opportunity
 
04:21:37.110 --> 04:21:37.120 align:start position:0%
and if i'm in a district like dairy for
 
04:21:37.120 --> 04:21:38.710 align:start position:0%
and if i'm in a district like dairy for
example

04:21:38.710 --> 04:21:38.720 align:start position:0%
example
 
04:21:38.720 --> 04:21:39.590 align:start position:0%
example
where

04:21:39.590 --> 04:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
where
 
04:21:41.590 --> 04:21:41.600 align:start position:0%
you know you there are problems down
 
04:21:43.910 --> 04:21:43.920 align:start position:0%
there as it relates to funding as well
 
04:21:46.229 --> 04:21:46.239 align:start position:0%
as claremont or newport or berlin or
 
04:21:46.239 --> 04:21:47.349 align:start position:0%
as claremont or newport or berlin or
whatever

04:21:47.349 --> 04:21:47.359 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
04:21:49.670 --> 04:21:49.680 align:start position:0%
how do we begin to create a fairer
 
04:21:51.189 --> 04:21:51.199 align:start position:0%
funding system
 
04:21:53.910 --> 04:21:53.920 align:start position:0%
so that those students in those
 
04:21:56.710 --> 04:21:56.720 align:start position:0%
impoverished areas or the the
 
04:21:58.870 --> 04:21:58.880 align:start position:0%
those that don't have the same kind of
 
04:22:01.429 --> 04:22:01.439 align:start position:0%
equity in their property taxes how do we
 
04:22:03.510 --> 04:22:03.520 align:start position:0%
help them
 
04:22:05.349 --> 04:22:05.359 align:start position:0%
join that workforce
 
04:22:07.990 --> 04:22:08.000 align:start position:0%
so that they have an equal opportunity
 
04:22:09.750 --> 04:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
just as those students that are in
 
04:22:12.550 --> 04:22:12.560 align:start position:0%
wealthy areas and i think
 
04:22:14.229 --> 04:22:14.239 align:start position:0%
you don't want to you want we don't want
 
04:22:16.870 --> 04:22:16.880 align:start position:0%
to stigmatize anybody but as we looked
 
04:22:19.510 --> 04:22:19.520 align:start position:0%
at the data that came before us it was
 
04:22:20.950 --> 04:22:20.960 align:start position:0%
very clear
 
04:22:23.349 --> 04:22:23.359 align:start position:0%
that those students in those lower
 
04:22:26.149 --> 04:22:26.159 align:start position:0%
poorest school districts they don't have
 
04:22:28.070 --> 04:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
the same opportunities they've got
 
04:22:29.990 --> 04:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
teacher turnover because they can't pay
 
04:22:32.070 --> 04:22:32.080 align:start position:0%
kids they've got an administrative
 
04:22:34.149 --> 04:22:34.159 align:start position:0%
turnover and when you don't have that
 
04:22:36.309 --> 04:22:36.319 align:start position:0%
same kind of continuity that you have in
 
04:22:38.630 --> 04:22:38.640 align:start position:0%
the more wealthier districts and so this
 
04:22:41.030 --> 04:22:41.040 align:start position:0%
is a long-term issue i mean this is not
 
04:22:42.790 --> 04:22:42.800 align:start position:0%
something that we're going to resolve
 
04:22:45.189 --> 04:22:45.199 align:start position:0%
today or tomorrow but as we begin to
 
04:22:46.550 --> 04:22:46.560 align:start position:0%
look beyond
 
04:22:48.950 --> 04:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
where we have been we now have greater
 
04:22:51.189 --> 04:22:51.199 align:start position:0%
data that we can really look at student
 
04:22:53.429 --> 04:22:53.439 align:start position:0%
performance in a way that we never have
 
04:22:55.110 --> 04:22:55.120 align:start position:0%
before and i think that's really what
 
04:22:56.790 --> 04:22:56.800 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do is how do we provide
 
04:22:59.189 --> 04:22:59.199 align:start position:0%
greater parity greater opportunity
 
04:23:01.349 --> 04:23:01.359 align:start position:0%
for for an equal opportunity for school
 
04:23:03.670 --> 04:23:03.680 align:start position:0%
for schooling
 
04:23:05.030 --> 04:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
i'm not trying to answer your question
 
04:23:07.670 --> 04:23:07.680 align:start position:0%
mike but that but but that's that was
 
04:23:09.429 --> 04:23:09.439 align:start position:0%
the issue i mean and you'll see in some
 
04:23:11.349 --> 04:23:11.359 align:start position:0%
of the graphs that we have that we
 
04:23:14.469 --> 04:23:14.479 align:start position:0%
developed based upon uh the
 
04:23:17.269 --> 04:23:17.279 align:start position:0%
form 25 from the doe after looking at
 
04:23:19.110 --> 04:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
for 10 years you really begin to see
 
04:23:21.590 --> 04:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
some drastic we do well generally across
 
04:23:24.309 --> 04:23:24.319 align:start position:0%
the state but we have pockets within the
 
04:23:27.670 --> 04:23:27.680 align:start position:0%
state that are in in great need
 
04:23:31.429 --> 04:23:31.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:33.030 --> 04:23:33.040 align:start position:0%
did you want to uh
 
04:23:34.790 --> 04:23:34.800 align:start position:0%
win yeah i i i
 
04:23:36.550 --> 04:23:36.560 align:start position:0%
i think you covered it really really
 
04:23:39.670 --> 04:23:39.680 align:start position:0%
well um no but uh i'll look forward to
 
04:23:43.110 --> 04:23:43.120 align:start position:0%
the opportunity on monday to present to
 
04:23:45.990 --> 04:23:46.000 align:start position:0%
all legislators and then later on
 
04:23:48.469 --> 04:23:48.479 align:start position:0%
to the members on this on this committee
 
04:23:50.389 --> 04:23:50.399 align:start position:0%
um and we can really really get down
 
04:23:52.870 --> 04:23:52.880 align:start position:0%
into the the commission's findings
 
04:23:55.269 --> 04:23:55.279 align:start position:0%
thank you hey please have one last
 
04:23:57.110 --> 04:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
comment yes
 
04:23:57.120 --> 04:23:58.870 align:start position:0%
comment yes
um

04:23:58.870 --> 04:23:58.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:24:01.030 --> 04:24:01.040 align:start position:0%
it's not going to be just dollars which
 
04:24:03.590 --> 04:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
fix what we have in this state
 
04:24:03.600 --> 04:24:05.269 align:start position:0%
fix what we have in this state
um

04:24:05.269 --> 04:24:05.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:24:07.670 --> 04:24:07.680 align:start position:0%
and i heard somebody earlier today say
 
04:24:10.389 --> 04:24:10.399 align:start position:0%
education is a shared responsibility
 
04:24:13.429 --> 04:24:13.439 align:start position:0%
between local and state and it is
 
04:24:14.870 --> 04:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
and we all know the instruction
 
04:24:18.070 --> 04:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
curriculum is a local issue
 
04:24:20.790 --> 04:24:20.800 align:start position:0%
and we also know that there's different
 
04:24:20.800 --> 04:24:22.469 align:start position:0%
and we also know that there's different
aspirations

04:24:22.469 --> 04:24:22.479 align:start position:0%
aspirations
 
04:24:24.790 --> 04:24:24.800 align:start position:0%
for towards education in many
 
04:24:26.790 --> 04:24:26.800 align:start position:0%
communities we also know there's
 
04:24:28.710 --> 04:24:28.720 align:start position:0%
different education levels
 
04:24:31.269 --> 04:24:31.279 align:start position:0%
in communities of the general population
 
04:24:33.110 --> 04:24:33.120 align:start position:0%
that general demographic
 
04:24:35.030 --> 04:24:35.040 align:start position:0%
we also know that there's differences
 
04:24:36.870 --> 04:24:36.880 align:start position:0%
from one school to another school in
 
04:24:39.510 --> 04:24:39.520 align:start position:0%
terms of leadership and supervision in
 
04:24:40.870 --> 04:24:40.880 align:start position:0%
that school
 
04:24:43.349 --> 04:24:43.359 align:start position:0%
we know there's differences between a
 
04:24:45.590 --> 04:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
great chemistry teacher and a teacher
 
04:24:47.429 --> 04:24:47.439 align:start position:0%
that's in there just filling that hole
 
04:24:48.950 --> 04:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
that's you know you can't find anybody
 
04:24:50.710 --> 04:24:50.720 align:start position:0%
to teach chemistry
 
04:24:54.550 --> 04:24:54.560 align:start position:0%
um there there there's all these issues
 
04:24:55.750 --> 04:24:55.760 align:start position:0%
which are
 
04:24:59.189 --> 04:24:59.199 align:start position:0%
are are relevant to this discussion so
 
04:25:01.189 --> 04:25:01.199 align:start position:0%
it's not going to be just dollars that
 
04:25:03.590 --> 04:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
fix it the dollars are imperative in
 
04:25:05.189 --> 04:25:05.199 align:start position:0%
certain locations where we have these
 
04:25:07.590 --> 04:25:07.600 align:start position:0%
inequities in these disparities
 
04:25:09.590 --> 04:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
and we got to make sure that we're also
 
04:25:12.630 --> 04:25:12.640 align:start position:0%
funding our education in terms of what
 
04:25:15.349 --> 04:25:15.359 align:start position:0%
we define as adequacy
 
04:25:17.510 --> 04:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
those are all key issues
 
04:25:20.070 --> 04:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
and the legislature has responsibility
 
04:25:22.229 --> 04:25:22.239 align:start position:0%
to delve into that and hopefully the
 
04:25:25.510 --> 04:25:25.520 align:start position:0%
education committee will in in this year
 
04:25:28.309 --> 04:25:28.319 align:start position:0%
and next year and really take a serious
 
04:25:31.110 --> 04:25:31.120 align:start position:0%
look at that so there's a lot to this
 
04:25:33.269 --> 04:25:33.279 align:start position:0%
but we do need a funding formula of
 
04:25:35.189 --> 04:25:35.199 align:start position:0%
sorts because we're right there
 
04:25:37.590 --> 04:25:37.600 align:start position:0%
in another another year developing a
 
04:25:39.830 --> 04:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
budget for fy23
 
04:25:42.710 --> 04:25:42.720 align:start position:0%
and and that's right now so something's
 
04:25:44.630 --> 04:25:44.640 align:start position:0%
going to have to happen when all this
 
04:25:48.710 --> 04:25:48.720 align:start position:0%
happens over in division two thank you
 
04:25:50.070 --> 04:25:50.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:25:52.790 --> 04:25:52.800 align:start position:0%
i see representative lakers has a
 
04:25:52.800 --> 04:26:00.830 align:start position:0%
i see representative lakers has a
question

04:26:00.830 --> 04:26:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:04.950 --> 04:26:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:07.349 --> 04:26:07.359 align:start position:0%
yes as as um
 
04:26:09.670 --> 04:26:09.680 align:start position:0%
chairman ladd was saying it's very
 
04:26:13.189 --> 04:26:13.199 align:start position:0%
complicated educating people
 
04:26:13.199 --> 04:26:14.149 align:start position:0%
complicated educating people
and

04:26:14.149 --> 04:26:14.159 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:26:16.550 --> 04:26:16.560 align:start position:0%
according to the um
 
04:26:18.790 --> 04:26:18.800 align:start position:0%
community college studies
 
04:26:22.389 --> 04:26:22.399 align:start position:0%
they have found that the more a person
 
04:26:24.870 --> 04:26:24.880 align:start position:0%
the more education a person has
 
04:26:27.030 --> 04:26:27.040 align:start position:0%
the more they make and one of the
 
04:26:29.429 --> 04:26:29.439 align:start position:0%
differences even in communities that you
 
04:26:31.269 --> 04:26:31.279 align:start position:0%
see a rich community and then kids who
 
04:26:32.550 --> 04:26:32.560 align:start position:0%
don't do well
 
04:26:36.070 --> 04:26:36.080 align:start position:0%
other lots of studies have shown that
 
04:26:38.389 --> 04:26:38.399 align:start position:0%
how well a kid does in school is very
 
04:26:40.550 --> 04:26:40.560 align:start position:0%
much dependent on the education level of
 
04:26:42.630 --> 04:26:42.640 align:start position:0%
the parents
 
04:26:45.189 --> 04:26:45.199 align:start position:0%
and um
 
04:26:47.830 --> 04:26:47.840 align:start position:0%
i guess i'm not in some ways sure how
 
04:26:47.840 --> 04:26:48.990 align:start position:0%
i guess i'm not in some ways sure how
just

04:26:48.990 --> 04:26:49.000 align:start position:0%
just
 
04:26:52.149 --> 04:26:52.159 align:start position:0%
incentivizing schools to
 
04:26:53.510 --> 04:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
04:26:55.349 --> 04:26:55.359 align:start position:0%
the other thing is people work based on
 
04:26:57.030 --> 04:26:57.040 align:start position:0%
incentives right
 
04:26:57.040 --> 04:26:59.030 align:start position:0%
incentives right
so

04:26:59.030 --> 04:26:59.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:27:02.070 --> 04:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure how throwing money around
 
04:27:04.229 --> 04:27:04.239 align:start position:0%
solves the problem of the education of
 
04:27:07.189 --> 04:27:07.199 align:start position:0%
the parents unless we're giving it to
 
04:27:09.830 --> 04:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
charter school i mean not to um
 
04:27:12.630 --> 04:27:12.640 align:start position:0%
community colleges to help parents get
 
04:27:14.710 --> 04:27:14.720 align:start position:0%
higher levels of education
 
04:27:16.229 --> 04:27:16.239 align:start position:0%
which that's
 
04:27:18.070 --> 04:27:18.080 align:start position:0%
64 by
 
04:27:21.510 --> 04:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
65 by 25 they're working on
 
04:27:21.520 --> 04:27:24.870 align:start position:0%
65 by 25 they're working on
and

04:27:24.870 --> 04:27:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:26.870 --> 04:27:26.880 align:start position:0%
incentivizing to me
 
04:27:29.510 --> 04:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
okay so you give this extra money to
 
04:27:32.070 --> 04:27:32.080 align:start position:0%
begin with like like we are in here
 
04:27:33.830 --> 04:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
giving some extra money
 
04:27:35.750 --> 04:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
to schools who are
 
04:27:37.590 --> 04:27:37.600 align:start position:0%
not to students who are not doing as
 
04:27:40.870 --> 04:27:40.880 align:start position:0%
well but i think we need to be
 
04:27:43.990 --> 04:27:44.000 align:start position:0%
almost incentivizing for improvement so
 
04:27:46.389 --> 04:27:46.399 align:start position:0%
you get extra money as a school
 
04:27:48.950 --> 04:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
if you can show a certain percentage of
 
04:27:50.950 --> 04:27:50.960 align:start position:0%
improvement because here we're
 
04:27:54.630 --> 04:27:54.640 align:start position:0%
incentivizing as um
 
04:27:54.640 --> 04:27:55.830 align:start position:0%
incentivizing as um
um

04:27:55.830 --> 04:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:27:58.229 --> 04:27:58.239 align:start position:0%
brett moffatt said incentivizing for
 
04:27:58.239 --> 04:27:59.269 align:start position:0%
brett moffatt said incentivizing for
failure

04:27:59.269 --> 04:27:59.279 align:start position:0%
failure
 
04:28:01.189 --> 04:28:01.199 align:start position:0%
and i think we need to incentivize for
 
04:28:01.199 --> 04:28:03.030 align:start position:0%
and i think we need to incentivize for
improvement

04:28:03.030 --> 04:28:03.040 align:start position:0%
improvement
 
04:28:04.630 --> 04:28:04.640 align:start position:0%
is did you have a question for
 
04:28:06.630 --> 04:28:06.640 align:start position:0%
representative lab
 
04:28:08.469 --> 04:28:08.479 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i was just joining in on the
 
04:28:11.990 --> 04:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:12.000 --> 04:28:13.110 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:28:13.110 --> 04:28:13.120 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:28:16.070 --> 04:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
um we have rep mullen
 
04:28:18.309 --> 04:28:18.319 align:start position:0%
and uh red blue now
 
04:28:20.309 --> 04:28:20.319 align:start position:0%
okay representative mullen
 
04:28:22.229 --> 04:28:22.239 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative
 
04:28:23.750 --> 04:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
cordelli um
 
04:28:25.670 --> 04:28:25.680 align:start position:0%
representative ladd thank you for taking
 
04:28:28.950 --> 04:28:28.960 align:start position:0%
the question on page two i actually have
 
04:28:32.070 --> 04:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
specific questions on page two
 
04:28:33.990 --> 04:28:34.000 align:start position:0%
line four
 
04:28:37.830 --> 04:28:37.840 align:start position:0%
the words an opportunity for are added
 
04:28:40.550 --> 04:28:40.560 align:start position:0%
prior to the phrase and adequate
 
04:28:43.670 --> 04:28:43.680 align:start position:0%
education could you explain to me what
 
04:28:46.950 --> 04:28:46.960 align:start position:0%
you hope to accomplish with the language
 
04:28:51.030 --> 04:28:51.040 align:start position:0%
change in that section of the bill
 
04:28:53.269 --> 04:28:53.279 align:start position:0%
well you know the we've always had you
 
04:28:54.550 --> 04:28:54.560 align:start position:0%
know just plain
 
04:28:57.510 --> 04:28:57.520 align:start position:0%
cost of an adequate education
 
04:29:00.309 --> 04:29:00.319 align:start position:0%
but i think the word opportunity is more
 
04:29:02.790 --> 04:29:02.800 align:start position:0%
in keeping with where we need to go in
 
04:29:05.750 --> 04:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
terms of supporting and providing that
 
04:29:08.469 --> 04:29:08.479 align:start position:0%
opportunity you know you're what how are
 
04:29:10.309 --> 04:29:10.319 align:start position:0%
you going to measure just
 
04:29:12.229 --> 04:29:12.239 align:start position:0%
adequate education is it going to be a
 
04:29:15.510 --> 04:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
test or we can measure through the input
 
04:29:15.520 --> 04:29:16.710 align:start position:0%
test or we can measure through the input
process

04:29:16.710 --> 04:29:16.720 align:start position:0%
process
 
04:29:18.950 --> 04:29:18.960 align:start position:0%
that they're providing the opportunity
 
04:29:20.469 --> 04:29:20.479 align:start position:0%
they have
 
04:29:22.710 --> 04:29:22.720 align:start position:0%
media specialists they have librarians
 
04:29:24.790 --> 04:29:24.800 align:start position:0%
they have teachers they have textbooks
 
04:29:27.189 --> 04:29:27.199 align:start position:0%
they have the supply money they have the
 
04:29:28.229 --> 04:29:28.239 align:start position:0%
maintenance money they have the
 
04:29:31.750 --> 04:29:31.760 align:start position:0%
transportation now is we are providing
 
04:29:33.429 --> 04:29:33.439 align:start position:0%
the opportunity
 
04:29:33.439 --> 04:29:34.469 align:start position:0%
the opportunity
for

04:29:34.469 --> 04:29:34.479 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:29:37.990 --> 04:29:38.000 align:start position:0%
an adequate education we're not
 
04:29:40.229 --> 04:29:40.239 align:start position:0%
we and we are also providing the
 
04:29:43.110 --> 04:29:43.120 align:start position:0%
adequate education yes but
 
04:29:44.710 --> 04:29:44.720 align:start position:0%
i think it's important that our
 
04:29:47.429 --> 04:29:47.439 align:start position:0%
phraseology which it does in many places
 
04:29:49.510 --> 04:29:49.520 align:start position:0%
throughout this legislation when you
 
04:29:51.590 --> 04:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
look at the cost of an opportunity for
 
04:29:54.070 --> 04:29:54.080 align:start position:0%
an adequate education that's right there
 
04:29:56.389 --> 04:29:56.399 align:start position:0%
in 198.48
 
04:29:59.189 --> 04:29:59.199 align:start position:0%
they use the word opportunity uh i i
 
04:30:01.910 --> 04:30:01.920 align:start position:0%
guess i guess what i was looking for was
 
04:30:04.149 --> 04:30:04.159 align:start position:0%
whether or not there was a definition
 
04:30:07.269 --> 04:30:07.279 align:start position:0%
anywhere of what an opportunity for an
 
04:30:10.550 --> 04:30:10.560 align:start position:0%
adequate education actually consisted of
 
04:30:10.560 --> 04:30:11.590 align:start position:0%
adequate education actually consisted of
um

04:30:11.590 --> 04:30:11.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:30:13.590 --> 04:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
because i like you i've seen it in other
 
04:30:16.550 --> 04:30:16.560 align:start position:0%
places but i can't find a definition of
 
04:30:19.030 --> 04:30:19.040 align:start position:0%
it i was hoping that that's where your
 
04:30:21.429 --> 04:30:21.439 align:start position:0%
language change came from
 
04:30:22.950 --> 04:30:22.960 align:start position:0%
no it's going to come back from
 
04:30:24.630 --> 04:30:24.640 align:start position:0%
discerning what you're how you're
 
04:30:26.830 --> 04:30:26.840 align:start position:0%
defining education back in
 
04:30:29.030 --> 04:30:29.040 align:start position:0%
193a and you're going to have to go back
 
04:30:31.990 --> 04:30:32.000 align:start position:0%
to that level of statute to find this
 
04:30:33.349 --> 04:30:33.359 align:start position:0%
because right here we're talking about
 
04:30:35.110 --> 04:30:35.120 align:start position:0%
the costing of this
 
04:30:37.269 --> 04:30:37.279 align:start position:0%
that back there it's the policy section
 
04:30:39.030 --> 04:30:39.040 align:start position:0%
where we're really defining
 
04:30:40.790 --> 04:30:40.800 align:start position:0%
what are the components what are the
 
04:30:43.510 --> 04:30:43.520 align:start position:0%
elements what are what is that adequate
 
04:30:45.590 --> 04:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity opportunity for an adequate
 
04:30:45.600 --> 04:30:46.950 align:start position:0%
opportunity opportunity for an adequate
education

04:30:46.950 --> 04:30:46.960 align:start position:0%
education
 
04:30:49.590 --> 04:30:49.600 align:start position:0%
and it's that rigorous academic study
 
04:30:51.349 --> 04:30:51.359 align:start position:0%
that we talked about a little earlier on
 
04:30:51.359 --> 04:30:52.710 align:start position:0%
that we talked about a little earlier on
242

04:30:52.710 --> 04:30:52.720 align:start position:0%
242
 
04:30:53.830 --> 04:30:53.840 align:start position:0%
it's the
 
04:30:56.149 --> 04:30:56.159 align:start position:0%
the all those components that lifts
 
04:30:58.710 --> 04:30:58.720 align:start position:0%
those domains underneath it
 
04:31:01.429 --> 04:31:01.439 align:start position:0%
um the substance criteria
 
04:31:03.349 --> 04:31:03.359 align:start position:0%
for an adequate education that's what we
 
04:31:05.670 --> 04:31:05.680 align:start position:0%
have to hike back and look at
 
04:31:07.110 --> 04:31:07.120 align:start position:0%
all right i thank you for that if i
 
04:31:08.870 --> 04:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
could just ask my second question
 
04:31:10.550 --> 04:31:10.560 align:start position:0%
representative cordelia i would be
 
04:31:13.110 --> 04:31:13.120 align:start position:0%
indebted to you
 
04:31:16.070 --> 04:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
representative ladd in the bill analysis
 
04:31:17.429 --> 04:31:17.439 align:start position:0%
it says
 
04:31:19.590 --> 04:31:19.600 align:start position:0%
roman numeral 3
 
04:31:19.600 --> 04:31:23.269 align:start position:0%
roman numeral 3
that

04:31:23.269 --> 04:31:23.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:25.910 --> 04:31:25.920 align:start position:0%
the law governing transportation of
 
04:31:28.550 --> 04:31:28.560 align:start position:0%
pupils in kindergarten
 
04:31:31.110 --> 04:31:31.120 align:start position:0%
through grade 12 is amended
 
04:31:34.070 --> 04:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
and i for the life of me cannot find it
 
04:31:36.309 --> 04:31:36.319 align:start position:0%
in this amendment can you just
 
04:31:38.790 --> 04:31:38.800 align:start position:0%
point me in the direction of where the
 
04:31:40.630 --> 04:31:40.640 align:start position:0%
language is that amends the
 
04:31:43.189 --> 04:31:43.199 align:start position:0%
transportation language when i spoke
 
04:31:45.750 --> 04:31:45.760 align:start position:0%
with mickey landrigan over an lba
 
04:31:48.469 --> 04:31:48.479 align:start position:0%
after our exact sessions this morning i
 
04:31:50.950 --> 04:31:50.960 align:start position:0%
said mickey that number three is i don't
 
04:31:52.790 --> 04:31:52.800 align:start position:0%
know who put that in you
 
04:31:55.590 --> 04:31:55.600 align:start position:0%
but he said a lot of times
 
04:31:58.469 --> 04:31:58.479 align:start position:0%
there are bills that come out of
 
04:31:58.479 --> 04:31:59.269 align:start position:0%
there are bills that come out of
uh

04:31:59.269 --> 04:31:59.279 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:32:01.189 --> 04:32:01.199 align:start position:0%
legislative services
 
04:32:03.110 --> 04:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
that have components in there which are
 
04:32:05.030 --> 04:32:05.040 align:start position:0%
just not reflective
 
04:32:07.269 --> 04:32:07.279 align:start position:0%
and where they find most of this stuff
 
04:32:10.149 --> 04:32:10.159 align:start position:0%
is when they're dealing with hp too
 
04:32:11.910 --> 04:32:11.920 align:start position:0%
and and that's where a lot of these
 
04:32:15.510 --> 04:32:15.520 align:start position:0%
errors are found so no this does not do
 
04:32:17.189 --> 04:32:17.199 align:start position:0%
anything the transportation is still
 
04:32:20.149 --> 04:32:20.159 align:start position:0%
provided for our k-12 youngsters and
 
04:32:22.149 --> 04:32:22.159 align:start position:0%
we're looking at costly and the costing
 
04:32:24.950 --> 04:32:24.960 align:start position:0%
is the only place we cost that out is in
 
04:32:27.910 --> 04:32:27.920 align:start position:0%
base adequacy okay good great thank you
 
04:32:30.389 --> 04:32:30.399 align:start position:0%
i thought i i'm telling you i read this
 
04:32:33.110 --> 04:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
amendment 16 different times trying to
 
04:32:35.910 --> 04:32:35.920 align:start position:0%
find it so i couldn't find it
 
04:32:38.149 --> 04:32:38.159 align:start position:0%
that's good that's very affirming for me
 
04:32:39.990 --> 04:32:40.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:32:44.229 --> 04:32:44.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:46.550 --> 04:32:46.560 align:start position:0%
thank you very much to be able to go
 
04:32:49.750 --> 04:32:49.760 align:start position:0%
back to the uh representative moffat and
 
04:32:51.429 --> 04:32:51.439 align:start position:0%
lucas comet
 
04:32:54.070 --> 04:32:54.080 align:start position:0%
if i may so i'm not asking a question if
 
04:32:57.910 --> 04:32:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:57.920 --> 04:32:59.189 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:32:59.189 --> 04:32:59.199 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:33:00.830 --> 04:33:00.840 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
04:33:01.990 --> 04:33:02.000 align:start position:0%
representative uh
 
04:33:05.189 --> 04:33:05.199 align:start position:0%
i'm get i get concerned when i hear
 
04:33:07.109 --> 04:33:07.119 align:start position:0%
public education funding
 
04:33:08.949 --> 04:33:08.959 align:start position:0%
based on incentivizing
 
04:33:08.959 --> 04:33:10.949 align:start position:0%
based on incentivizing
uh

04:33:10.949 --> 04:33:10.959 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:33:10.959 --> 04:33:12.470 align:start position:0%
uh
resources

04:33:12.470 --> 04:33:12.480 align:start position:0%
resources
 
04:33:14.230 --> 04:33:14.240 align:start position:0%
it reminds me of the gentleman who
 
04:33:16.390 --> 04:33:16.400 align:start position:0%
testified last week when he was talking
 
04:33:18.789 --> 04:33:18.799 align:start position:0%
about mcdonald's and the french fries he
 
04:33:20.390 --> 04:33:20.400 align:start position:0%
said take more money away and they'll
 
04:33:23.670 --> 04:33:23.680 align:start position:0%
get better it reminds me of military
 
04:33:26.230 --> 04:33:26.240 align:start position:0%
people who are involved in the military
 
04:33:29.189 --> 04:33:29.199 align:start position:0%
who if we don't put money into r d how
 
04:33:30.551 --> 04:33:30.561 align:start position:0%
do we expect our weapons to keep our
 
04:33:33.189 --> 04:33:33.199 align:start position:0%
military forces to be successful it's
 
04:33:35.189 --> 04:33:35.199 align:start position:0%
the same thing here if we don't put our
 
04:33:38.150 --> 04:33:38.160 align:start position:0%
resources in those schools or systems
 
04:33:40.150 --> 04:33:40.160 align:start position:0%
that need the additional help how do we
 
04:33:41.750 --> 04:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
expect to have those youngsters get
 
04:33:43.670 --> 04:33:43.680 align:start position:0%
better you take resources away from a
 
04:33:45.910 --> 04:33:45.920 align:start position:0%
system that's already hurting and then
 
04:33:48.070 --> 04:33:48.080 align:start position:0%
you just make it worse you clearly not
 
04:33:50.709 --> 04:33:50.719 align:start position:0%
gonna be competitive at all um you know
 
04:33:52.390 --> 04:33:52.400 align:start position:0%
it's like a team with five basketballs
 
04:33:54.310 --> 04:33:54.320 align:start position:0%
or a team with one it's a lot less time
 
04:33:55.189 --> 04:33:55.199 align:start position:0%
to practice when you have five
 
04:33:57.029 --> 04:33:57.039 align:start position:0%
basketballs and one i guess that whole
 
04:33:59.189 --> 04:33:59.199 align:start position:0%
that whole concept of taking money away
 
04:34:00.390 --> 04:34:00.400 align:start position:0%
i'm not suggesting it shouldn't be
 
04:34:02.070 --> 04:34:02.080 align:start position:0%
directed in a better manner i'm not
 
04:34:04.390 --> 04:34:04.400 align:start position:0%
suggesting that but just taking it away
 
04:34:06.230 --> 04:34:06.240 align:start position:0%
it makes me nervous thank you for the
 
04:34:08.310 --> 04:34:08.320 align:start position:0%
privilege of representative codelli
 
04:34:10.470 --> 04:34:10.480 align:start position:0%
thank you representative luna i believe
 
04:34:11.590 --> 04:34:11.600 align:start position:0%
is next
 
04:34:14.470 --> 04:34:14.480 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair and um and
 
04:34:16.629 --> 04:34:16.639 align:start position:0%
uh thanks again rick for taking the
 
04:34:20.150 --> 04:34:20.160 align:start position:0%
question um uh representative smith who
 
04:34:22.310 --> 04:34:22.320 align:start position:0%
who was the prime sponsor of the of the
 
04:34:22.320 --> 04:34:23.189 align:start position:0%
who was the prime sponsor of the of the
bill

04:34:23.189 --> 04:34:23.199 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:34:25.189 --> 04:34:25.199 align:start position:0%
spoke a little bit about the urgency of
 
04:34:28.150 --> 04:34:28.160 align:start position:0%
of the school funding issue
 
04:34:30.629 --> 04:34:30.639 align:start position:0%
certainly as it relates to the the towns
 
04:34:32.949 --> 04:34:32.959 align:start position:0%
that he represents and you mentioned it
 
04:34:34.789 --> 04:34:34.799 align:start position:0%
yourself just a couple of minutes ago
 
04:34:36.709 --> 04:34:36.719 align:start position:0%
that we're right there now working on
 
04:34:39.670 --> 04:34:39.680 align:start position:0%
the fy 22 fy 23 budget
 
04:34:41.269 --> 04:34:41.279 align:start position:0%
and that we need to do something here
 
04:34:42.551 --> 04:34:42.561 align:start position:0%
and i was wondering if you could talk to
 
04:34:44.789 --> 04:34:44.799 align:start position:0%
the effective date and how
 
04:34:46.869 --> 04:34:46.879 align:start position:0%
how that
 
04:34:49.029 --> 04:34:49.039 align:start position:0%
works with all this
 
04:34:51.590 --> 04:34:51.600 align:start position:0%
well my goal on this represent luna is
 
04:34:54.789 --> 04:34:54.799 align:start position:0%
that this uh and i agree urgency is
 
04:34:54.799 --> 04:34:56.070 align:start position:0%
that this uh and i agree urgency is
imperative

04:34:56.070 --> 04:34:56.080 align:start position:0%
imperative
 
04:34:58.949 --> 04:34:58.959 align:start position:0%
uh it would get to finance
 
04:34:58.959 --> 04:35:00.709 align:start position:0%
uh it would get to finance
and

04:35:00.709 --> 04:35:00.719 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:35:03.349 --> 04:35:03.359 align:start position:0%
the issues which are described here
 
04:35:05.429 --> 04:35:05.439 align:start position:0%
i don't give a darn and nor does
 
04:35:07.349 --> 04:35:07.359 align:start position:0%
representative smith whether this bill
 
04:35:09.830 --> 04:35:09.840 align:start position:0%
is the bill that does it but we got to
 
04:35:09.840 --> 04:35:10.949 align:start position:0%
is the bill that does it but we got to
inform

04:35:10.949 --> 04:35:10.959 align:start position:0%
inform
 
04:35:13.590 --> 04:35:13.600 align:start position:0%
uh division two and those people are
 
04:35:16.869 --> 04:35:16.879 align:start position:0%
putting together hb1 and hb2
 
04:35:19.670 --> 04:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
to include somewhere in there
 
04:35:19.680 --> 04:35:20.470 align:start position:0%
to include somewhere in there
the

04:35:20.470 --> 04:35:20.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:35:22.789 --> 04:35:22.799 align:start position:0%
issues those principles those concepts
 
04:35:25.029 --> 04:35:25.039 align:start position:0%
which we all are addressing
 
04:35:26.789 --> 04:35:26.799 align:start position:0%
the the one issue i think where we
 
04:35:30.230 --> 04:35:30.240 align:start position:0%
diverge is i'm concerned where the
 
04:35:32.230 --> 04:35:32.240 align:start position:0%
revenue comes from
 
04:35:34.310 --> 04:35:34.320 align:start position:0%
and and uh the
 
04:35:36.629 --> 04:35:36.639 align:start position:0%
the amount of costing for some of those
 
04:35:39.590 --> 04:35:39.600 align:start position:0%
particular areas uh within uh which i
 
04:35:41.990 --> 04:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
spoke to earlier this afternoon
 
04:35:43.189 --> 04:35:43.199 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
04:35:45.750 --> 04:35:45.760 align:start position:0%
my concerns are i'd like to see this put
 
04:35:47.349 --> 04:35:47.359 align:start position:0%
in effect for the beginning of the next
 
04:35:47.359 --> 04:35:51.029 align:start position:0%
in effect for the beginning of the next
biennium

04:35:51.029 --> 04:35:51.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:51.990 --> 04:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:35:52.869 --> 04:35:52.879 align:start position:0%

04:35:59.670 --> 04:35:59.680 align:start position:0%
represent acting chair cordelli we have
 
04:35:59.680 --> 04:36:00.709 align:start position:0%
represent acting chair cordelli we have
uh

04:36:00.709 --> 04:36:00.719 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:36:02.869 --> 04:36:02.879 align:start position:0%
representative shaw would like to ask a
 
04:36:06.629 --> 04:36:06.639 align:start position:0%

from way back
 
04:36:19.349 --> 04:36:19.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:22.949 --> 04:36:22.959 align:start position:0%

uh that it wasn't in even
 
04:36:32.480 --> 04:36:35.189 align:start position:0%
uh that it wasn't in even
uh

04:36:35.189 --> 04:36:35.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:38.150 --> 04:36:38.160 align:start position:0%

04:36:58.150 --> 04:36:58.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:00.869 --> 04:37:00.879 align:start position:0%
uh seen
 
04:37:00.879 --> 04:37:01.910 align:start position:0%
uh seen
uh

04:37:01.910 --> 04:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:37:03.349 --> 04:37:03.359 align:start position:0%
representative hopson i think we have a
 
04:37:05.109 --> 04:37:05.119 align:start position:0%
member of the public
 
04:37:06.869 --> 04:37:06.879 align:start position:0%
yep uh
 
04:37:06.879 --> 04:37:08.310 align:start position:0%
yep uh
deagon

04:37:08.310 --> 04:37:08.320 align:start position:0%
deagon
 
04:37:11.189 --> 04:37:11.199 align:start position:0%
mckern i'm gonna uh allow you to talk go
 
04:37:12.390 --> 04:37:12.400 align:start position:0%
ahead please
 
04:37:15.830 --> 04:37:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:18.070 --> 04:37:18.080 align:start position:0%
thank you uh
 
04:37:21.510 --> 04:37:21.520 align:start position:0%
chair and members of the committee um
 
04:37:24.070 --> 04:37:24.080 align:start position:0%
it seems as though uh not being on the
 
04:37:27.269 --> 04:37:27.279 align:start position:0%
committee myself uh was not uh privy to
 
04:37:29.109 --> 04:37:29.119 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
04:37:31.029 --> 04:37:31.039 align:start position:0%
it seems that the
 
04:37:32.390 --> 04:37:32.400 align:start position:0%
the donor town
 
04:37:35.269 --> 04:37:35.279 align:start position:0%
issue has been resolved from this bill
 
04:37:37.990 --> 04:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
for the moment
 
04:37:40.709 --> 04:37:40.719 align:start position:0%
i would just like to
 
04:37:44.230 --> 04:37:44.240 align:start position:0%
to add um on that it's it's difficult to
 
04:37:47.349 --> 04:37:47.359 align:start position:0%
hear uh i guess repeatedly how much
 
04:37:50.390 --> 04:37:50.400 align:start position:0%
um it's it's cut into uh wealthy towns
 
04:37:52.629 --> 04:37:52.639 align:start position:0%
and and not wealthy towns and i don't
 
04:37:55.029 --> 04:37:55.039 align:start position:0%
necessarily believe that that speaks to
 
04:37:57.029 --> 04:37:57.039 align:start position:0%
the issue
 
04:37:59.510 --> 04:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
at hand and i don't want to return
 
04:38:01.590 --> 04:38:01.600 align:start position:0%
to the donor town language i do believe
 
04:38:01.600 --> 04:38:02.629 align:start position:0%
to the donor town language i do believe
that

04:38:02.629 --> 04:38:02.639 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:38:04.629 --> 04:38:04.639 align:start position:0%
you know it was seven when the new
 
04:38:06.070 --> 04:38:06.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire community sued the state
 
04:38:07.709 --> 04:38:07.719 align:start position:0%
arguing that education funding was
 
04:38:10.470 --> 04:38:10.480 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional and 30 years later i do
 
04:38:10.480 --> 04:38:11.750 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional and 30 years later i do
agree

04:38:11.750 --> 04:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
agree
 
04:38:13.510 --> 04:38:13.520 align:start position:0%
and that new hampshire is one community
 
04:38:15.910 --> 04:38:15.920 align:start position:0%
i heard that stressed by a number of
 
04:38:17.429 --> 04:38:17.439 align:start position:0%
committee members that we have to think
 
04:38:19.189 --> 04:38:19.199 align:start position:0%
of children that don't live in our
 
04:38:20.869 --> 04:38:20.879 align:start position:0%
district as they are our own children
 
04:38:22.949 --> 04:38:22.959 align:start position:0%
and i strive to do that
 
04:38:25.510 --> 04:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
but in portsmouth um
 
04:38:27.830 --> 04:38:27.840 align:start position:0%
you know this idea that that everyone uh
 
04:38:27.840 --> 04:38:28.789 align:start position:0%
you know this idea that that everyone uh
is

04:38:28.789 --> 04:38:28.799 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:38:30.709 --> 04:38:30.719 align:start position:0%
is equally able to
 
04:38:32.629 --> 04:38:32.639 align:start position:0%
afford that the house that the level
 
04:38:34.310 --> 04:38:34.320 align:start position:0%
it's being assessed at
 
04:38:36.949 --> 04:38:36.959 align:start position:0%
um it's it's just not uh it doesn't jive
 
04:38:38.709 --> 04:38:38.719 align:start position:0%
with everything that i've seen
 
04:38:41.429 --> 04:38:41.439 align:start position:0%
um as a city council member
 
04:38:43.670 --> 04:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
um and you know
 
04:38:46.230 --> 04:38:46.240 align:start position:0%
i didn't have to listen to my dad to to
 
04:38:48.150 --> 04:38:48.160 align:start position:0%
believe that that portsmouth has changed
 
04:38:50.470 --> 04:38:50.480 align:start position:0%
i've seen it you've likely seen it for
 
04:38:52.230 --> 04:38:52.240 align:start position:0%
yourself if you just look at the tax
 
04:38:52.240 --> 04:38:53.349 align:start position:0%
yourself if you just look at the tax
receipts

04:38:53.349 --> 04:38:53.359 align:start position:0%
receipts
 
04:38:55.670 --> 04:38:55.680 align:start position:0%
for the rooms and meals uh tax you would
 
04:38:57.750 --> 04:38:57.760 align:start position:0%
believe that that there wasn't a single
 
04:39:00.310 --> 04:39:00.320 align:start position:0%
home cook in in all of portsmouth but
 
04:39:03.189 --> 04:39:03.199 align:start position:0%
it's equally foolish to believe that uh
 
04:39:05.510 --> 04:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
that everyone in portsmouth can afford
 
04:39:07.750 --> 04:39:07.760 align:start position:0%
to buy their house or even the taxes of
 
04:39:09.830 --> 04:39:09.840 align:start position:0%
the assessed value of their house
 
04:39:12.310 --> 04:39:12.320 align:start position:0%
today so i look forward to seeing what
 
04:39:13.750 --> 04:39:13.760 align:start position:0%
comes out of
 
04:39:15.269 --> 04:39:15.279 align:start position:0%
this committee
 
04:39:17.029 --> 04:39:17.039 align:start position:0%
and the future of new hampshire very
 
04:39:18.869 --> 04:39:18.879 align:start position:0%
much depends upon
 
04:39:20.789 --> 04:39:20.799 align:start position:0%
that you guys come together and do a
 
04:39:22.390 --> 04:39:22.400 align:start position:0%
great job so i thank you for your
 
04:39:24.629 --> 04:39:24.639 align:start position:0%
service to new hampshire
 
04:39:25.670 --> 04:39:25.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:39:26.869 --> 04:39:26.879 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:39:28.949 --> 04:39:28.959 align:start position:0%
do you have any questions
 
04:39:31.990 --> 04:39:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:33.109 --> 04:39:33.119 align:start position:0%
see none
 
04:39:33.119 --> 04:39:34.070 align:start position:0%
see none
uh

04:39:34.070 --> 04:39:34.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:39:36.470 --> 04:39:36.480 align:start position:0%
oh excuse me i do see one representative
 
04:39:39.750 --> 04:39:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:42.390 --> 04:39:42.400 align:start position:0%
yes i was just wondering um what you
 
04:39:44.390 --> 04:39:44.400 align:start position:0%
were saying has a lot to do with what
 
04:39:46.868 --> 04:39:46.878 align:start position:0%
i've been thinking a lot about
 
04:39:52.310 --> 04:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:54.310 --> 04:39:54.320 align:start position:0%
from what you see in portsmouth and what
 
04:39:57.270 --> 04:39:57.280 align:start position:0%
others in the state see it makes more
 
04:40:00.390 --> 04:40:00.400 align:start position:0%
sense to base the extra money on
 
04:40:03.350 --> 04:40:03.360 align:start position:0%
the ability to pay as opposed to
 
04:40:05.110 --> 04:40:05.120 align:start position:0%
what um
 
04:40:07.510 --> 04:40:07.520 align:start position:0%
a house is assessed at which may be
 
04:40:10.390 --> 04:40:10.400 align:start position:0%
artificially large just because there's
 
04:40:13.430 --> 04:40:13.440 align:start position:0%
high demand in that area not because
 
04:40:15.750 --> 04:40:15.760 align:start position:0%
uh people are deaf are necessarily
 
04:40:18.550 --> 04:40:18.560 align:start position:0%
wealthy and so if maybe some other
 
04:40:21.230 --> 04:40:21.240 align:start position:0%
method that's based more on
 
04:40:21.240 --> 04:40:22.550 align:start position:0%
method that's based more on
[Music]

04:40:22.550 --> 04:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:40:24.550 --> 04:40:24.560 align:start position:0%
what people make
 
04:40:24.560 --> 04:40:25.430 align:start position:0%
what people make
whether

04:40:25.430 --> 04:40:25.440 align:start position:0%
whether
 
04:40:27.030 --> 04:40:27.040 align:start position:0%
that or
 
04:40:29.190 --> 04:40:29.200 align:start position:0%
some way of measuring that people's
 
04:40:32.070 --> 04:40:32.080 align:start position:0%
ability to pay as opposed to
 
04:40:34.788 --> 04:40:34.798 align:start position:0%
property values what do you think
 
04:40:37.030 --> 04:40:37.040 align:start position:0%
well i'm happy to take the question i'm
 
04:40:39.590 --> 04:40:39.600 align:start position:0%
now a bit over my skis because i i i
 
04:40:41.030 --> 04:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
don't know if i can speak for the city
 
04:40:44.070 --> 04:40:44.080 align:start position:0%
of portsmouth uh in this but as dangling
 
04:40:45.670 --> 04:40:45.680 align:start position:0%
mcagren's citizen
 
04:40:48.150 --> 04:40:48.160 align:start position:0%
uh and council member uh i do believe
 
04:40:50.310 --> 04:40:50.320 align:start position:0%
that we should take into account one's
 
04:40:52.230 --> 04:40:52.240 align:start position:0%
ability to pay you know a house doesn't
 
04:40:54.708 --> 04:40:54.718 align:start position:0%
pay property taxes people always pay
 
04:40:56.470 --> 04:40:56.480 align:start position:0%
property taxes and i you know i was
 
04:40:58.470 --> 04:40:58.480 align:start position:0%
listening to the senate testimony
 
04:41:01.110 --> 04:41:01.120 align:start position:0%
on uh you know i'm forgetting the the
 
04:41:04.230 --> 04:41:04.240 align:start position:0%
bill it was uh senate bill 158 uh and
 
04:41:06.628 --> 04:41:06.638 align:start position:0%
often was referred to by the commission
 
04:41:09.270 --> 04:41:09.280 align:start position:0%
uh i think it was charter 70 from
 
04:41:11.670 --> 04:41:11.680 align:start position:0%
massachusetts uh that figured this out
 
04:41:13.910 --> 04:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
and how to pay uh for an adequate
 
04:41:15.910 --> 04:41:15.920 align:start position:0%
education but they do take in the
 
04:41:17.830 --> 04:41:17.840 align:start position:0%
ability they do take the resident's
 
04:41:20.868 --> 04:41:20.878 align:start position:0%
ability to pay they take into account uh
 
04:41:24.628 --> 04:41:24.638 align:start position:0%
the wealth uh and the incomes of those
 
04:41:26.310 --> 04:41:26.320 align:start position:0%
of those individuals in addition to the
 
04:41:29.270 --> 04:41:29.280 align:start position:0%
housing values when they identify how
 
04:41:31.590 --> 04:41:31.600 align:start position:0%
much those uh those different houses or
 
04:41:33.190 --> 04:41:33.200 align:start position:0%
how much those different
 
04:41:34.310 --> 04:41:34.320 align:start position:0%
communities are going to have to
 
04:41:37.030 --> 04:41:37.040 align:start position:0%
contribute and until we do that i don't
 
04:41:38.708 --> 04:41:38.718 align:start position:0%
believe that we're going to have a fair
 
04:41:42.390 --> 04:41:42.400 align:start position:0%
funding model in in new hampshire uh
 
04:41:44.230 --> 04:41:44.240 align:start position:0%
frankly but again that's me speaking as
 
04:41:45.430 --> 04:41:45.440 align:start position:0%
an individual
 
04:41:47.190 --> 04:41:47.200 align:start position:0%
uh answering a question
 
04:41:50.788 --> 04:41:50.798 align:start position:0%
and not for a town of 23 000 people
 
04:41:51.910 --> 04:41:51.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:41:54.390 --> 04:41:54.400 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
04:41:56.470 --> 04:41:56.480 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh no further
 
04:41:58.628 --> 04:41:58.638 align:start position:0%
questions i thank you very much for your
 
04:42:02.390 --> 04:42:02.400 align:start position:0%
testimony and being here this afternoon
 
04:42:05.430 --> 04:42:05.440 align:start position:0%
um and i think we have uh another
 
04:42:07.830 --> 04:42:07.840 align:start position:0%
representative who just
 
04:42:16.628 --> 04:42:16.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:18.550 --> 04:42:18.560 align:start position:0%
good afternoon everyone thank you so
 
04:42:20.628 --> 04:42:20.638 align:start position:0%
much i don't want to take up too much
 
04:42:24.230 --> 04:42:24.240 align:start position:0%
time i did send in testimony i have been
 
04:42:26.948 --> 04:42:26.958 align:start position:0%
listening in i i didn't i'm sorry i
 
04:42:29.270 --> 04:42:29.280 align:start position:0%
couldn't join you at the beginning
 
04:42:29.280 --> 04:42:30.230 align:start position:0%
couldn't join you at the beginning
um

04:42:30.230 --> 04:42:30.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:42:31.830 --> 04:42:31.840 align:start position:0%
but you know one thing with this
 
04:42:34.550 --> 04:42:34.560 align:start position:0%
particular bill is that i would really
 
04:42:37.670 --> 04:42:37.680 align:start position:0%
like to see the stabilization grants go
 
04:42:40.390 --> 04:42:40.400 align:start position:0%
away and and take that money that we're
 
04:42:42.070 --> 04:42:42.080 align:start position:0%
spending on that
 
04:42:44.708 --> 04:42:44.718 align:start position:0%
and put it into the adequacy money
 
04:42:46.788 --> 04:42:46.798 align:start position:0%
that way because the adequacy money
 
04:42:50.470 --> 04:42:50.480 align:start position:0%
really is is based on current um
 
04:42:52.788 --> 04:42:52.798 align:start position:0%
enrollments and and i you know that's
 
04:42:54.628 --> 04:42:54.638 align:start position:0%
where the kids are
 
04:42:54.638 --> 04:42:55.670 align:start position:0%
where the kids are
so

04:42:55.670 --> 04:42:55.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:42:58.310 --> 04:42:58.320 align:start position:0%
you know i i just would like to see that
 
04:42:58.320 --> 04:42:59.270 align:start position:0%
you know i i just would like to see that
happen

04:42:59.270 --> 04:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
happen
 
04:43:03.270 --> 04:43:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:05.510 --> 04:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative
 
04:43:05.520 --> 04:43:06.708 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative
um

04:43:06.708 --> 04:43:06.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:43:09.110 --> 04:43:09.120 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee that i see
 
04:43:11.110 --> 04:43:11.120 align:start position:0%
so uh i thank you very much and enjoy
 
04:43:12.868 --> 04:43:12.878 align:start position:0%
the rest of your afternoon
 
04:43:12.878 --> 04:43:13.910 align:start position:0%
the rest of your afternoon
thanks

04:43:13.910 --> 04:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
04:43:16.788 --> 04:43:16.798 align:start position:0%
next we have paul de shane
 
04:43:20.470 --> 04:43:20.480 align:start position:0%
welcome to education go ahead please
 
04:43:23.110 --> 04:43:23.120 align:start position:0%
uh thank you my name is uh paul duchaine
 
04:43:24.788 --> 04:43:24.798 align:start position:0%
and i'm a project manager with the town
 
04:43:25.990 --> 04:43:26.000 align:start position:0%
of newington
 
04:43:28.470 --> 04:43:28.480 align:start position:0%
i didn't anticipate speaking today but
 
04:43:30.628 --> 04:43:30.638 align:start position:0%
the introduction of the amendment
 
04:43:33.350 --> 04:43:33.360 align:start position:0%
uh changes the perspective newington has
 
04:43:36.230 --> 04:43:36.240 align:start position:0%
on uh house bill 608
 
04:43:39.430 --> 04:43:39.440 align:start position:0%
i had initially lodged an opposition
 
04:43:41.030 --> 04:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
position to that and
 
04:43:42.390 --> 04:43:42.400 align:start position:0%
you'll have a
 
04:43:44.628 --> 04:43:44.638 align:start position:0%
subsequent written comment from the town
 
04:43:46.390 --> 04:43:46.400 align:start position:0%
on knowington
 
04:43:47.750 --> 04:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
in that vein
 
04:43:49.510 --> 04:43:49.520 align:start position:0%
however i wanted to say with the
 
04:43:51.350 --> 04:43:51.360 align:start position:0%
introduction to the amendment preserving
 
04:43:53.670 --> 04:43:53.680 align:start position:0%
right to see and review and comment
 
04:43:53.680 --> 04:43:54.550 align:start position:0%
right to see and review and comment
later

04:43:54.550 --> 04:43:54.560 align:start position:0%
later
 
04:43:56.470 --> 04:43:56.480 align:start position:0%
it would appear that our objection has
 
04:43:58.628 --> 04:43:58.638 align:start position:0%
now been overcome since most of our
 
04:44:00.550 --> 04:44:00.560 align:start position:0%
objection is related to
 
04:44:03.910 --> 04:44:03.920 align:start position:0%
again the use of excess swept being
 
04:44:06.550 --> 04:44:06.560 align:start position:0%
a return to a donor town receiver town
 
04:44:06.560 --> 04:44:07.510 align:start position:0%
a return to a donor town receiver town
model

04:44:07.510 --> 04:44:07.520 align:start position:0%
model
 
04:44:10.070 --> 04:44:10.080 align:start position:0%
that we feel is non-productive
 
04:44:11.750 --> 04:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
for the entire state of new hampshire
 
04:44:13.350 --> 04:44:13.360 align:start position:0%
for for various reasons that you'll see
 
04:44:15.110 --> 04:44:15.120 align:start position:0%
in my written comments so
 
04:44:16.948 --> 04:44:16.958 align:start position:0%
i i thank you
 
04:44:19.190 --> 04:44:19.200 align:start position:0%
for this opportunity to address you and
 
04:44:21.350 --> 04:44:21.360 align:start position:0%
now correct or or
 
04:44:22.708 --> 04:44:22.718 align:start position:0%
amend my own
 
04:44:22.718 --> 04:44:23.910 align:start position:0%
amend my own
uh

04:44:23.910 --> 04:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:44:25.670 --> 04:44:25.680 align:start position:0%
opposition originally on behalf of the
 
04:44:28.708 --> 04:44:28.718 align:start position:0%
town and uh i look forward to continue
 
04:44:30.628 --> 04:44:30.638 align:start position:0%
to working with you all as uh we all
 
04:44:33.670 --> 04:44:33.680 align:start position:0%
need to address this issue
 
04:44:35.270 --> 04:44:35.280 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
04:44:38.470 --> 04:44:38.480 align:start position:0%
um i do not see any questions so uh
 
04:44:42.310 --> 04:44:42.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for uh your testimony today
 
04:44:44.470 --> 04:44:44.480 align:start position:0%
okay it looks like last we have eric
 
04:44:44.480 --> 04:44:45.830 align:start position:0%
okay it looks like last we have eric
froworth

04:44:45.830 --> 04:44:45.840 align:start position:0%
froworth
 
04:44:49.430 --> 04:44:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:51.270 --> 04:44:51.280 align:start position:0%
uh good afternoon thank you
 
04:44:52.788 --> 04:44:52.798 align:start position:0%
my name is eric frowarth i am the
 
04:44:54.550 --> 04:44:54.560 align:start position:0%
administrator for the bureau of career
 
04:44:56.868 --> 04:44:56.878 align:start position:0%
development for the department of
 
04:44:56.878 --> 04:44:58.390 align:start position:0%
development for the department of
education

04:44:58.390 --> 04:44:58.400 align:start position:0%
education
 
04:44:59.990 --> 04:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
and as i reviewed the original bill and
 
04:45:02.550 --> 04:45:02.560 align:start position:0%
again i also have not seen the amendment
 
04:45:04.628 --> 04:45:04.638 align:start position:0%
but in the conversation it doesn't look
 
04:45:06.708 --> 04:45:06.718 align:start position:0%
like the subject i'd like to address was
 
04:45:06.718 --> 04:45:09.030 align:start position:0%
like the subject i'd like to address was
addressed

04:45:09.030 --> 04:45:09.040 align:start position:0%
addressed
 
04:45:11.270 --> 04:45:11.280 align:start position:0%
i would like to talk about uh the
 
04:45:11.280 --> 04:45:12.868 align:start position:0%
i would like to talk about uh the
inclusion

04:45:12.868 --> 04:45:12.878 align:start position:0%
inclusion
 
04:45:16.390 --> 04:45:16.400 align:start position:0%
funds specifically for students in cte
 
04:45:18.628 --> 04:45:18.638 align:start position:0%
into this adequacy bill
 
04:45:19.590 --> 04:45:19.600 align:start position:0%
a quick
 
04:45:23.030 --> 04:45:23.040 align:start position:0%
word search of rsa 193e which is the law
 
04:45:25.190 --> 04:45:25.200 align:start position:0%
covering an adequate education
 
04:45:27.190 --> 04:45:27.200 align:start position:0%
reveals some very telling uh
 
04:45:27.200 --> 04:45:28.628 align:start position:0%
reveals some very telling uh
terminologies

04:45:28.628 --> 04:45:28.638 align:start position:0%
terminologies
 
04:45:31.110 --> 04:45:31.120 align:start position:0%
the terminology computer science appears
 
04:45:31.120 --> 04:45:32.150 align:start position:0%
the terminology computer science appears
twice

04:45:32.150 --> 04:45:32.160 align:start position:0%
twice
 
04:45:34.470 --> 04:45:34.480 align:start position:0%
mathematics four times
 
04:45:36.230 --> 04:45:36.240 align:start position:0%
science six
 
04:45:37.990 --> 04:45:38.000 align:start position:0%
language 7
 
04:45:41.110 --> 04:45:41.120 align:start position:0%
and career 10 times
 
04:45:42.310 --> 04:45:42.320 align:start position:0%
while this may not be a direct
 
04:45:44.310 --> 04:45:44.320 align:start position:0%
correlation to the intended significance
 
04:45:45.510 --> 04:45:45.520 align:start position:0%
of the terms
 
04:45:47.350 --> 04:45:47.360 align:start position:0%
the fact that the word career appears
 
04:45:49.190 --> 04:45:49.200 align:start position:0%
more than any of the other quote unquote
 
04:45:51.430 --> 04:45:51.440 align:start position:0%
core academic courses
 
04:45:52.788 --> 04:45:52.798 align:start position:0%
is certainly an indication that the
 
04:45:55.030 --> 04:45:55.040 align:start position:0%
drafters of 193
 
04:45:56.390 --> 04:45:56.400 align:start position:0%
felt that preparing new hampshire
 
04:45:58.788 --> 04:45:58.798 align:start position:0%
students for a career was a vital
 
04:46:01.350 --> 04:46:01.360 align:start position:0%
component of an adequate education
 
04:46:03.030 --> 04:46:03.040 align:start position:0%
as such i would ask this committee to
 
04:46:05.030 --> 04:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
consider the inclusion of differential
 
04:46:07.590 --> 04:46:07.600 align:start position:0%
aid for students participating in career
 
04:46:09.830 --> 04:46:09.840 align:start position:0%
and tech education programs
 
04:46:11.590 --> 04:46:11.600 align:start position:0%
as many of you are aware the current
 
04:46:14.070 --> 04:46:14.080 align:start position:0%
tuition and transportation allocation
 
04:46:16.708 --> 04:46:16.718 align:start position:0%
is directed solely at students attending
 
04:46:20.868 --> 04:46:20.878 align:start position:0%
cte from non-host high school
 
04:46:22.948 --> 04:46:22.958 align:start position:0%
our recent study shows that that
 
04:46:26.310 --> 04:46:26.320 align:start position:0%
population represents only about 29 of
 
04:46:28.550 --> 04:46:28.560 align:start position:0%
students in cte
 
04:46:30.628 --> 04:46:30.638 align:start position:0%
what that means is as an average host
 
04:46:32.628 --> 04:46:32.638 align:start position:0%
high school districts are covering the
 
04:46:35.110 --> 04:46:35.120 align:start position:0%
cost of 71 percent of the cte
 
04:46:37.190 --> 04:46:37.200 align:start position:0%
enrollments in their center with
 
04:46:39.430 --> 04:46:39.440 align:start position:0%
absolutely no additional help from the
 
04:46:39.440 --> 04:46:40.230 align:start position:0%
absolutely no additional help from the
state

04:46:40.230 --> 04:46:40.240 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:46:41.830 --> 04:46:41.840 align:start position:0%
in some school districts such as
 
04:46:41.840 --> 04:46:43.350 align:start position:0%
in some school districts such as
rochester

04:46:43.350 --> 04:46:43.360 align:start position:0%
rochester
 
04:46:46.150 --> 04:46:46.160 align:start position:0%
this number is as high as 98 percent
 
04:46:49.830 --> 04:46:49.840 align:start position:0%
now just like special education and ell
 
04:46:52.948 --> 04:46:52.958 align:start position:0%
cte education costs more
 
04:46:55.670 --> 04:46:55.680 align:start position:0%
than a traditional classroom education
 
04:46:57.750 --> 04:46:57.760 align:start position:0%
so as such again i would ask
 
04:46:59.510 --> 04:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
that you would consider adding another
 
04:47:02.470 --> 04:47:02.480 align:start position:0%
amendment including a differentiated aid
 
04:47:05.110 --> 04:47:05.120 align:start position:0%
for students participating in cte
 
04:47:08.230 --> 04:47:08.240 align:start position:0%
as was noted in the commission report
 
04:47:10.390 --> 04:47:10.400 align:start position:0%
regarding adequate education and i'm
 
04:47:13.030 --> 04:47:13.040 align:start position:0%
more than happy to uh discuss questions
 
04:47:15.670 --> 04:47:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:17.270 --> 04:47:17.280 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
04:47:21.830 --> 04:47:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:32.390 --> 04:47:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:32.400 --> 04:47:33.350 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

04:47:33.350 --> 04:47:33.360 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:47:35.830 --> 04:47:35.840 align:start position:0%
my unmute button just i can tap it it
 
04:47:37.430 --> 04:47:37.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't like to on you
 
04:47:37.440 --> 04:47:38.390 align:start position:0%
doesn't like to on you
um

04:47:38.390 --> 04:47:38.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:47:40.868 --> 04:47:40.878 align:start position:0%
yeah my question was since it sounds
 
04:47:43.430 --> 04:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
like you've done some research on this
 
04:47:46.550 --> 04:47:46.560 align:start position:0%
can you make a an estimate of how much
 
04:47:48.708 --> 04:47:48.718 align:start position:0%
more it
 
04:47:51.910 --> 04:47:51.920 align:start position:0%
it costs a cte student than a regular
 
04:47:52.990 --> 04:47:53.000 align:start position:0%
than a
 
04:47:55.030 --> 04:47:55.040 align:start position:0%
non-cete student
 
04:47:57.430 --> 04:47:57.440 align:start position:0%
sure we're all irregular so that's okay
 
04:47:59.430 --> 04:47:59.440 align:start position:0%
um yes
 
04:48:02.628 --> 04:48:02.638 align:start position:0%
it it does vary uh from school to school
 
04:48:05.110 --> 04:48:05.120 align:start position:0%
as does the cost of any education from
 
04:48:07.590 --> 04:48:07.600 align:start position:0%
school to school uh some of our programs
 
04:48:09.350 --> 04:48:09.360 align:start position:0%
like business programs may only be a
 
04:48:12.948 --> 04:48:12.958 align:start position:0%
small increase where auto or cosmetology
 
04:48:14.628 --> 04:48:14.638 align:start position:0%
or some of the stem-based ones would be
 
04:48:14.638 --> 04:48:16.390 align:start position:0%
or some of the stem-based ones would be
higher

04:48:16.390 --> 04:48:16.400 align:start position:0%
higher
 
04:48:16.400 --> 04:48:17.510 align:start position:0%
higher
currently

04:48:17.510 --> 04:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
currently
 
04:48:20.550 --> 04:48:20.560 align:start position:0%
uh the way the funding happens
 
04:48:22.390 --> 04:48:22.400 align:start position:0%
it it is whatever is left in the pot of
 
04:48:24.628 --> 04:48:24.638 align:start position:0%
money was divided among students and it
 
04:48:24.638 --> 04:48:25.590 align:start position:0%
money was divided among students and it
come

04:48:25.590 --> 04:48:25.600 align:start position:0%
come
 
04:48:28.550 --> 04:48:28.560 align:start position:0%
last year to about 3 800
 
04:48:31.030 --> 04:48:31.040 align:start position:0%
uh was what the state uh put in for
 
04:48:33.030 --> 04:48:33.040 align:start position:0%
those students and as we looked around
 
04:48:36.708 --> 04:48:36.718 align:start position:0%
the country uh between 3 500 and 4 500
 
04:48:37.910 --> 04:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
was about
 
04:48:40.788 --> 04:48:40.798 align:start position:0%
um average around the country for what
 
04:48:44.070 --> 04:48:44.080 align:start position:0%
um cte education costs above and beyond
 
04:48:46.390 --> 04:48:46.400 align:start position:0%
um and to to just give you the dollar
 
04:48:49.590 --> 04:48:49.600 align:start position:0%
figure of that if we used that figure
 
04:48:53.670 --> 04:48:53.680 align:start position:0%
for all 10 000 of our cte students
 
04:48:56.150 --> 04:48:56.160 align:start position:0%
that would be about a 37 million dollar
 
04:49:01.190 --> 04:49:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:02.310 --> 04:49:02.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:49:04.310 --> 04:49:04.320 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
04:49:09.030 --> 04:49:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:11.030 --> 04:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
i thank you very much for being here
 
04:49:13.990 --> 04:49:14.000 align:start position:0%
this afternoon thank you
 
04:49:15.590 --> 04:49:15.600 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
04:49:18.310 --> 04:49:18.320 align:start position:0%
i know that there was a mr mcclinch who
 
04:49:26.868 --> 04:49:26.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:30.230 --> 04:49:30.240 align:start position:0%
okay go ahead please mr mc lynch
 
04:49:31.830 --> 04:49:31.840 align:start position:0%
uh thank you very much can the members
 
04:49:33.350 --> 04:49:33.360 align:start position:0%
of the committee hear me
 
04:49:35.910 --> 04:49:35.920 align:start position:0%
yes yes wonderful uh well chairman ladd
 
04:49:37.190 --> 04:49:37.200 align:start position:0%
representative milor members of the
 
04:49:38.788 --> 04:49:38.798 align:start position:0%
committee thank you for the opportunity
 
04:49:40.470 --> 04:49:40.480 align:start position:0%
to offer testimony this afternoon on
 
04:49:43.030 --> 04:49:43.040 align:start position:0%
house bill 608 for the record my name is
 
04:49:44.628 --> 04:49:44.638 align:start position:0%
jeff mcglinch and i'm the project
 
04:49:46.070 --> 04:49:46.080 align:start position:0%
director of the new hampshire school
 
04:49:48.150 --> 04:49:48.160 align:start position:0%
funding fairness project
 
04:49:50.788 --> 04:49:50.798 align:start position:0%
as initially introduced house bill 608
 
04:49:52.390 --> 04:49:52.400 align:start position:0%
contained a number of provisions that
 
04:49:53.510 --> 04:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
would have strengthened new hampshire's
 
04:49:55.030 --> 04:49:55.040 align:start position:0%
school funding system
 
04:49:56.948 --> 04:49:56.958 align:start position:0%
for solve damaging declines in state
 
04:49:58.868 --> 04:49:58.878 align:start position:0%
education aid in the coming year
 
04:50:00.390 --> 04:50:00.400 align:start position:0%
and mitigated some of the inequities
 
04:50:01.590 --> 04:50:01.600 align:start position:0%
that now plagued new hampshire's
 
04:50:03.190 --> 04:50:03.200 align:start position:0%
property tax system
 
04:50:05.270 --> 04:50:05.280 align:start position:0%
uh as i understand it the amendment to
 
04:50:07.190 --> 04:50:07.200 align:start position:0%
the bill that's now before the committee
 
04:50:09.030 --> 04:50:09.040 align:start position:0%
would preserve several of the key key
 
04:50:11.110 --> 04:50:11.120 align:start position:0%
elements of that measure and address its
 
04:50:12.788 --> 04:50:12.798 align:start position:0%
principle shortcoming
 
04:50:14.550 --> 04:50:14.560 align:start position:0%
but it would also effectively strike too
 
04:50:16.310 --> 04:50:16.320 align:start position:0%
much needed changes in the underlying
 
04:50:16.320 --> 04:50:17.190 align:start position:0%
much needed changes in the underlying
bill

04:50:17.190 --> 04:50:17.200 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:50:19.110 --> 04:50:19.120 align:start position:0%
and delay its implementation until
 
04:50:21.350 --> 04:50:21.360 align:start position:0%
fiscal 2024.
 
04:50:22.628 --> 04:50:22.638 align:start position:0%
the the new hampshire school funding
 
04:50:24.310 --> 04:50:24.320 align:start position:0%
fairness project respectfully urges the
 
04:50:25.830 --> 04:50:25.840 align:start position:0%
committee to restore those two sets of
 
04:50:25.840 --> 04:50:26.868 align:start position:0%
committee to restore those two sets of
provisions

04:50:26.868 --> 04:50:26.878 align:start position:0%
provisions
 
04:50:28.310 --> 04:50:28.320 align:start position:0%
and to return the bill's effective date
 
04:50:30.788 --> 04:50:30.798 align:start position:0%
to later this year before approving it
 
04:50:32.708 --> 04:50:32.718 align:start position:0%
in its executive session
 
04:50:34.868 --> 04:50:34.878 align:start position:0%
just to expand upon those points
 
04:50:36.470 --> 04:50:36.480 align:start position:0%
one of the more immediate gains found in
 
04:50:38.868 --> 04:50:38.878 align:start position:0%
the original version of 608 was that it
 
04:50:40.708 --> 04:50:40.718 align:start position:0%
created a new floor for state education
 
04:50:40.718 --> 04:50:41.510 align:start position:0%
created a new floor for state education
aid

04:50:41.510 --> 04:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
aid
 
04:50:43.030 --> 04:50:43.040 align:start position:0%
to ensure that the amount of aid to
 
04:50:45.350 --> 04:50:45.360 align:start position:0%
municipality receives in a given year
 
04:50:46.708 --> 04:50:46.718 align:start position:0%
is no less than what i received in the
 
04:50:48.470 --> 04:50:48.480 align:start position:0%
preceding year
 
04:50:49.990 --> 04:50:50.000 align:start position:0%
and so doing that version of the bill
 
04:50:51.190 --> 04:50:51.200 align:start position:0%
would have offered some measure of
 
04:50:51.200 --> 04:50:52.230 align:start position:0%
would have offered some measure of
protection

04:50:52.230 --> 04:50:52.240 align:start position:0%
protection
 
04:50:54.310 --> 04:50:54.320 align:start position:0%
against the pandemic's possible impact
 
04:50:56.150 --> 04:50:56.160 align:start position:0%
on school finances
 
04:50:58.230 --> 04:50:58.240 align:start position:0%
i don't believe that language is now in
 
04:50:59.990 --> 04:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
the committee's amendment and so we
 
04:51:01.270 --> 04:51:01.280 align:start position:0%
would respectfully ask that the
 
04:51:03.430 --> 04:51:03.440 align:start position:0%
committee reinstate some form of a floor
 
04:51:05.670 --> 04:51:05.680 align:start position:0%
for state education aid for at least
 
04:51:08.550 --> 04:51:08.560 align:start position:0%
fiscal 22 when it considers the bill in
 
04:51:11.350 --> 04:51:11.360 align:start position:0%
executive session and you know just
 
04:51:13.830 --> 04:51:13.840 align:start position:0%
the original version really recognize
 
04:51:15.350 --> 04:51:15.360 align:start position:0%
the student counts we're seeing now and
 
04:51:16.788 --> 04:51:16.798 align:start position:0%
i'm sure you're well aware of the
 
04:51:16.798 --> 04:51:17.990 align:start position:0%
i'm sure you're well aware of the
declines

04:51:17.990 --> 04:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
declines
 
04:51:19.510 --> 04:51:19.520 align:start position:0%
that those counts are not likely to
 
04:51:21.190 --> 04:51:21.200 align:start position:0%
reflect the situation schools will face
 
04:51:22.788 --> 04:51:22.798 align:start position:0%
this fall fall
 
04:51:24.550 --> 04:51:24.560 align:start position:0%
and set a floor under state education
 
04:51:26.550 --> 04:51:26.560 align:start position:0%
aid to prevent those declines from
 
04:51:28.070 --> 04:51:28.080 align:start position:0%
having a very real impact on school's
 
04:51:29.990 --> 04:51:30.000 align:start position:0%
ability to provide every child
 
04:51:32.390 --> 04:51:32.400 align:start position:0%
with a quality education
 
04:51:34.310 --> 04:51:34.320 align:start position:0%
i should add that both the bill is
 
04:51:36.230 --> 04:51:36.240 align:start position:0%
introduced and my understanding of the
 
04:51:37.830 --> 04:51:37.840 align:start position:0%
amendment is that
 
04:51:39.190 --> 04:51:39.200 align:start position:0%
it would build upon the progress
 
04:51:41.350 --> 04:51:41.360 align:start position:0%
legislature made in the current budget
 
04:51:42.948 --> 04:51:42.958 align:start position:0%
in bolstering state education aid for
 
04:51:44.628 --> 04:51:44.638 align:start position:0%
communities most need
 
04:51:45.830 --> 04:51:45.840 align:start position:0%
both in the form of additional
 
04:51:45.840 --> 04:51:46.948 align:start position:0%
both in the form of additional
assistance

04:51:46.948 --> 04:51:46.958 align:start position:0%
assistance
 
04:51:49.590 --> 04:51:49.600 align:start position:0%
and fiscal capacity disparity aid
 
04:51:51.270 --> 04:51:51.280 align:start position:0%
however we're concerned that the
 
04:51:52.628 --> 04:51:52.638 align:start position:0%
amendment would not institute those
 
04:51:55.590 --> 04:51:55.600 align:start position:0%
reforms until fiscal 24.
 
04:51:57.110 --> 04:51:57.120 align:start position:0%
given the long-standing problems that
 
04:51:58.390 --> 04:51:58.400 align:start position:0%
have plagued new hampshire's school
 
04:52:00.150 --> 04:52:00.160 align:start position:0%
funding system as well as the new
 
04:52:01.910 --> 04:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
challenges students families and schools
 
04:52:01.920 --> 04:52:02.788 align:start position:0%
challenges students families and schools
face

04:52:02.788 --> 04:52:02.798 align:start position:0%
face
 
04:52:04.070 --> 04:52:04.080 align:start position:0%
we would encourage the committee to
 
04:52:06.470 --> 04:52:06.480 align:start position:0%
accelerate their implementation
 
04:52:09.750 --> 04:52:09.760 align:start position:0%
into the upcoming fiscal 22-23 biennium
 
04:52:11.830 --> 04:52:11.840 align:start position:0%
and i certainly appreciate that
 
04:52:13.350 --> 04:52:13.360 align:start position:0%
this committee wants to work with its
 
04:52:15.910 --> 04:52:15.920 align:start position:0%
counterparts in finance as the budget is
 
04:52:18.310 --> 04:52:18.320 align:start position:0%
crafted but i think a very strong signal
 
04:52:21.910 --> 04:52:21.920 align:start position:0%
from um this committee about the urgency
 
04:52:24.390 --> 04:52:24.400 align:start position:0%
of that issue and the need to address it
 
04:52:26.470 --> 04:52:26.480 align:start position:0%
would certainly help to inform their
 
04:52:26.480 --> 04:52:28.230 align:start position:0%
would certainly help to inform their
deliberations

04:52:28.230 --> 04:52:28.240 align:start position:0%
deliberations
 
04:52:30.150 --> 04:52:30.160 align:start position:0%
one other point i wanted to raise is
 
04:52:30.160 --> 04:52:31.190 align:start position:0%
one other point i wanted to raise is
that

04:52:31.190 --> 04:52:31.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:52:33.830 --> 04:52:33.840 align:start position:0%
the original version of house bill 608
 
04:52:35.270 --> 04:52:35.280 align:start position:0%
would have improved upon new hampshire's
 
04:52:37.270 --> 04:52:37.280 align:start position:0%
existing approach to school funding in
 
04:52:39.430 --> 04:52:39.440 align:start position:0%
another very critical way as it would
 
04:52:41.030 --> 04:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
have ended the preferential treatment
 
04:52:42.070 --> 04:52:42.080 align:start position:0%
that some property wealthy
 
04:52:42.080 --> 04:52:43.430 align:start position:0%
that some property wealthy
municipalities

04:52:43.430 --> 04:52:43.440 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
04:52:45.430 --> 04:52:45.440 align:start position:0%
now enjoy under the statewide education
 
04:52:47.750 --> 04:52:47.760 align:start position:0%
property tax and require every community
 
04:52:50.550 --> 04:52:50.560 align:start position:0%
to pay the full amount of that tax
 
04:52:52.390 --> 04:52:52.400 align:start position:0%
as this committee knows the new
 
04:52:53.670 --> 04:52:53.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire supreme court ruled in
 
04:52:55.110 --> 04:52:55.120 align:start position:0%
claremont 2
 
04:52:57.670 --> 04:52:57.680 align:start position:0%
that to the extent and this is a quote
 
04:52:59.510 --> 04:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
to the extent of the property taxes used
 
04:53:01.030 --> 04:53:01.040 align:start position:0%
in the future to fund the provision of
 
04:53:02.628 --> 04:53:02.638 align:start position:0%
an adequate education
 
04:53:04.390 --> 04:53:04.400 align:start position:0%
the tax must be administered in a manner
 
04:53:06.788 --> 04:53:06.798 align:start position:0%
that is equal in valuation and uniform
 
04:53:08.470 --> 04:53:08.480 align:start position:0%
in rate throughout the state
 
04:53:10.230 --> 04:53:10.240 align:start position:0%
in its current form the swept is far
 
04:53:12.150 --> 04:53:12.160 align:start position:0%
from uniform cities and towns with
 
04:53:13.910 --> 04:53:13.920 align:start position:0%
comparatively high property wealth are
 
04:53:15.670 --> 04:53:15.680 align:start position:0%
permitted to retain any revenue from the
 
04:53:18.310 --> 04:53:18.320 align:start position:0%
tax over and above what is needed to
 
04:53:20.550 --> 04:53:20.560 align:start position:0%
meet the cost of inadequate education
 
04:53:22.708 --> 04:53:22.718 align:start position:0%
consequently this the swept now
 
04:53:24.390 --> 04:53:24.400 align:start position:0%
exacerbates the wide disparities in
 
04:53:26.390 --> 04:53:26.400 align:start position:0%
school property tax rates that exist
 
04:53:28.070 --> 04:53:28.080 align:start position:0%
throughout the state and the trail of
 
04:53:29.510 --> 04:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
the opportunities available to students
 
04:53:31.670 --> 04:53:31.680 align:start position:0%
in less well to do areas
 
04:53:32.948 --> 04:53:32.958 align:start position:0%
restoring the swept is certainly
 
04:53:35.350 --> 04:53:35.360 align:start position:0%
consistent with the findings of the
 
04:53:36.628 --> 04:53:36.638 align:start position:0%
recent commission to study school
 
04:53:36.638 --> 04:53:37.510 align:start position:0%
recent commission to study school
funding

04:53:37.510 --> 04:53:37.520 align:start position:0%
funding
 
04:53:39.190 --> 04:53:39.200 align:start position:0%
and again while the original version of
 
04:53:41.910 --> 04:53:41.920 align:start position:0%
the bill included those provisions um
 
04:53:43.910 --> 04:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
this bill as representative vlad as
 
04:53:45.910 --> 04:53:45.920 align:start position:0%
chairman ladd has described do not
 
04:53:48.788 --> 04:53:48.798 align:start position:0%
include it we urge you to reinsert them
 
04:53:50.550 --> 04:53:50.560 align:start position:0%
lastly there had been one problem with
 
04:53:52.150 --> 04:53:52.160 align:start position:0%
the original bill in terms of the dollar
 
04:53:54.868 --> 04:53:54.878 align:start position:0%
amounts used in the adequacy formula it
 
04:53:56.230 --> 04:53:56.240 align:start position:0%
appears that the amendment now before
 
04:53:58.788 --> 04:53:58.798 align:start position:0%
the committee remedies that problem and
 
04:54:01.110 --> 04:54:01.120 align:start position:0%
we're happy to see that so in closing i
 
04:54:02.708 --> 04:54:02.718 align:start position:0%
hope that we at the new hampshire school
 
04:54:04.628 --> 04:54:04.638 align:start position:0%
funding fairness project will have the
 
04:54:05.830 --> 04:54:05.840 align:start position:0%
chance to work with the members of the
 
04:54:07.910 --> 04:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
committee and the sponsors of the bill
 
04:54:09.430 --> 04:54:09.440 align:start position:0%
to address the concerns i've outlined
 
04:54:11.510 --> 04:54:11.520 align:start position:0%
here and ultimately to build a school
 
04:54:13.510 --> 04:54:13.520 align:start position:0%
funding system that fulfills the state's
 
04:54:15.350 --> 04:54:15.360 align:start position:0%
responsibilities and that leads to
 
04:54:16.550 --> 04:54:16.560 align:start position:0%
greater equity for students and
 
04:54:18.788 --> 04:54:18.798 align:start position:0%
taxpayers like i thank you again for the
 
04:54:20.628 --> 04:54:20.638 align:start position:0%
chance to provide this testimony and i'd
 
04:54:21.990 --> 04:54:22.000 align:start position:0%
be happy to try to answer any questions

04:54:25.030 --> 04:54:25.040 align:start position:0%
thank you very much

are there any questions from the
 
04:54:26.638 --> 04:54:30.150 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from the
committee

04:54:30.150 --> 04:54:30.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:32.948 --> 04:54:32.958 align:start position:0%

thank you very much i better unmute
 
04:54:49.430 --> 04:54:49.440 align:start position:0%
myself here huh
 
04:54:50.390 --> 04:54:50.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:54:50.400 --> 04:54:51.590 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

04:54:51.590 --> 04:54:51.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:54:53.590 --> 04:54:53.600 align:start position:0%
there's an interesting conversation you
 
04:54:55.990 --> 04:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
just had with uh members of the public
 
04:54:57.830 --> 04:54:57.840 align:start position:0%
um and there are some things i think
 
04:55:00.150 --> 04:55:00.160 align:start position:0%
that we need to be looking at
 
04:55:02.550 --> 04:55:02.560 align:start position:0%
uh one of the things as the maker of
 
04:55:04.948 --> 04:55:04.958 align:start position:0%
this amendment i i um
 
04:55:06.868 --> 04:55:06.878 align:start position:0%
and somewhat concerned that it's not
 
04:55:07.990 --> 04:55:08.000 align:start position:0%
starting at the beginning of the
 
04:55:11.430 --> 04:55:11.440 align:start position:0%
biennium biennium fy 22.
 
04:55:14.390 --> 04:55:14.400 align:start position:0%
um it should i think that's just another
 
04:55:16.550 --> 04:55:16.560 align:start position:0%
you know catch within that particular
 
04:55:16.560 --> 04:55:17.670 align:start position:0%
you know catch within that particular
bill

04:55:17.670 --> 04:55:17.680 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:55:17.680 --> 04:55:19.270 align:start position:0%
bill
um

04:55:19.270 --> 04:55:19.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:55:22.470 --> 04:55:22.480 align:start position:0%
so there are are a lot of issues and if
 
04:55:23.910 --> 04:55:23.920 align:start position:0%
we have a second or two maybe we can
 
04:55:26.470 --> 04:55:26.480 align:start position:0%
open up the discussion and and maybe
 
04:55:28.470 --> 04:55:28.480 align:start position:0%
discuss some of that the last thing i'd
 
04:55:30.150 --> 04:55:30.160 align:start position:0%
like to mention
 
04:55:31.990 --> 04:55:32.000 align:start position:0%
is there's
 
04:55:34.550 --> 04:55:34.560 align:start position:0%
there there was one topic that always
 
04:55:36.310 --> 04:55:36.320 align:start position:0%
generated a lot of discussion with the
 
04:55:37.910 --> 04:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
funding commission this previous year
 
04:55:40.310 --> 04:55:40.320 align:start position:0%
and that was queer technical education
 
04:55:43.190 --> 04:55:43.200 align:start position:0%
is that a categorical grant function or
 
04:55:44.788 --> 04:55:44.798 align:start position:0%
is it a function that should be right
 
04:55:44.798 --> 04:55:45.830 align:start position:0%
is it a function that should be right
within

04:55:45.830 --> 04:55:45.840 align:start position:0%
within
 
04:55:47.830 --> 04:55:47.840 align:start position:0%
adequacy itself
 
04:55:47.840 --> 04:55:49.110 align:start position:0%
adequacy itself
um

04:55:49.110 --> 04:55:49.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:55:49.120 --> 04:55:50.230 align:start position:0%
um
that

04:55:50.230 --> 04:55:50.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:55:53.190 --> 04:55:53.200 align:start position:0%
i i don't think we ever got to ground
 
04:55:55.670 --> 04:55:55.680 align:start position:0%
zero on that with a decision but we
 
04:55:58.310 --> 04:55:58.320 align:start position:0%
recognize that there's much that has to
 
04:56:00.868 --> 04:56:00.878 align:start position:0%
be discussed where is the perkins money
 
04:56:04.788 --> 04:56:04.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:06.868 --> 04:56:06.878 align:start position:0%
in regard to attracting more students to
 
04:56:09.110 --> 04:56:09.120 align:start position:0%
the cte program how do we do that we
 
04:56:12.070 --> 04:56:12.080 align:start position:0%
need to have some funding transportation
 
04:56:14.310 --> 04:56:14.320 align:start position:0%
is an issue tuition an issue and that's
 
04:56:16.708 --> 04:56:16.718 align:start position:0%
basically why we put together this this
 
04:56:18.470 --> 04:56:18.480 align:start position:0%
bill and passed it unanimously on the
 
04:56:20.948 --> 04:56:20.958 align:start position:0%
first day we had a session that was hb
 
04:56:24.230 --> 04:56:24.240 align:start position:0%
304 there needs to be a healthy look at
 
04:56:27.350 --> 04:56:27.360 align:start position:0%
that um sticking it into adequacy right
 
04:56:29.910 --> 04:56:29.920 align:start position:0%
now i think would uh
 
04:56:31.750 --> 04:56:31.760 align:start position:0%
you know um
 
04:56:34.390 --> 04:56:34.400 align:start position:0%
i i i i don't have all the answers i
 
04:56:36.230 --> 04:56:36.240 align:start position:0%
don't know where the perkins stuff and
 
04:56:37.990 --> 04:56:38.000 align:start position:0%
how that's around nine million dollars
 
04:56:41.270 --> 04:56:41.280 align:start position:0%
total and and uh
 
04:56:43.270 --> 04:56:43.280 align:start position:0%
you we look at the tuition ranges in
 
04:56:44.868 --> 04:56:44.878 align:start position:0%
this state from rochester where it's
 
04:56:47.590 --> 04:56:47.600 align:start position:0%
thirty one hundred dollars per pupil
 
04:56:49.510 --> 04:56:49.520 align:start position:0%
and we go to berlin which is seven
 
04:56:51.190 --> 04:56:51.200 align:start position:0%
thousand three hundred dollars per pupil
 
04:56:52.868 --> 04:56:52.878 align:start position:0%
with the average cost from five thousand
 
04:56:54.550 --> 04:56:54.560 align:start position:0%
one hundred dollars those are the
 
04:56:56.150 --> 04:56:56.160 align:start position:0%
figures that the commission was given
 
04:56:57.830 --> 04:56:57.840 align:start position:0%
this summer
 
04:57:00.708 --> 04:57:00.718 align:start position:0%
uh so um there are a lot of issues that
 
04:57:03.110 --> 04:57:03.120 align:start position:0%
come into play here um
 
04:57:05.110 --> 04:57:05.120 align:start position:0%
we need to take a healthy look at this
 
04:57:08.230 --> 04:57:08.240 align:start position:0%
whole whole thing any other questions or
 
04:57:10.948 --> 04:57:10.958 align:start position:0%
ideas that you know came up during this
 
04:57:13.430 --> 04:57:13.440 align:start position:0%
previous hearing and i'd like to hear it
 
04:57:13.440 --> 04:57:18.948 align:start position:0%
previous hearing and i'd like to hear it
representing

04:57:18.948 --> 04:57:18.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:20.470 --> 04:57:20.480 align:start position:0%
where did i go
 
04:57:22.628 --> 04:57:22.638 align:start position:0%
can you hear me did it work
 
04:57:22.638 --> 04:57:23.670 align:start position:0%
can you hear me did it work
yes

04:57:23.670 --> 04:57:23.680 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:57:23.680 --> 04:57:25.430 align:start position:0%
yes
um

04:57:25.430 --> 04:57:25.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:57:27.350 --> 04:57:27.360 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to say
 
04:57:28.948 --> 04:57:28.958 align:start position:0%
well i wanted to say a couple things i
 
04:57:31.350 --> 04:57:31.360 align:start position:0%
really like figuring out how to
 
04:57:33.830 --> 04:57:33.840 align:start position:0%
see what we can do about cte i think cte
 
04:57:35.830 --> 04:57:35.840 align:start position:0%
is one of the more
 
04:57:37.830 --> 04:57:37.840 align:start position:0%
one of the more important things that we
 
04:57:40.628 --> 04:57:40.638 align:start position:0%
do in schools these days um
 
04:57:42.948 --> 04:57:42.958 align:start position:0%
it's no longer limited to the few things
 
04:57:46.470 --> 04:57:46.480 align:start position:0%
it was 28 years ago
 
04:57:49.110 --> 04:57:49.120 align:start position:0%
and it does include a number of higher
 
04:57:49.120 --> 04:57:50.310 align:start position:0%
and it does include a number of higher
tech

04:57:50.310 --> 04:57:50.320 align:start position:0%
tech
 
04:57:50.320 --> 04:57:51.830 align:start position:0%
tech
areas

04:57:51.830 --> 04:57:51.840 align:start position:0%
areas
 
04:57:54.070 --> 04:57:54.080 align:start position:0%
i think it's very important
 
04:57:54.080 --> 04:57:55.270 align:start position:0%
i think it's very important
and

04:57:55.270 --> 04:57:55.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:57:57.270 --> 04:57:57.280 align:start position:0%
how we do that i'm not sure but i think
 
04:57:58.868 --> 04:57:58.878 align:start position:0%
i agree that's something we really need
 
04:58:01.110 --> 04:58:01.120 align:start position:0%
to be looking at and the other thing
 
04:58:02.150 --> 04:58:02.160 align:start position:0%
just for
 
04:58:04.550 --> 04:58:04.560 align:start position:0%
representative luno i wasn't talking
 
04:58:07.110 --> 04:58:07.120 align:start position:0%
about taking any money away i was saying
 
04:58:09.830 --> 04:58:09.840 align:start position:0%
started a base where we give money extra
 
04:58:11.910 --> 04:58:11.920 align:start position:0%
money but then
 
04:58:14.788 --> 04:58:14.798 align:start position:0%
the first year and then give rewards for
 
04:58:17.430 --> 04:58:17.440 align:start position:0%
improvement it was to incentivize
 
04:58:20.150 --> 04:58:20.160 align:start position:0%
improvement but start with here's here's
 
04:58:22.390 --> 04:58:22.400 align:start position:0%
money which i think should be based not
 
04:58:22.400 --> 04:58:23.670 align:start position:0%
money which i think should be based not
on

04:58:23.670 --> 04:58:23.680 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:58:26.150 --> 04:58:26.160 align:start position:0%
valuation but should be based on whether
 
04:58:28.310 --> 04:58:28.320 align:start position:0%
it's free and reduced lunch or median
 
04:58:30.230 --> 04:58:30.240 align:start position:0%
income or whatever is going to most
 
04:58:30.240 --> 04:58:31.270 align:start position:0%
income or whatever is going to most
capture

04:58:31.270 --> 04:58:31.280 align:start position:0%
capture
 
04:58:33.910 --> 04:58:33.920 align:start position:0%
the ability of the residents of a town
 
04:58:36.390 --> 04:58:36.400 align:start position:0%
to pay
 
04:58:39.190 --> 04:58:39.200 align:start position:0%
give it based on that as a
 
04:58:41.830 --> 04:58:41.840 align:start position:0%
here's a chunk to fix things now
 
04:58:43.670 --> 04:58:43.680 align:start position:0%
fix things and will
 
04:58:43.680 --> 04:58:45.030 align:start position:0%
fix things and will
somehow

04:58:45.030 --> 04:58:45.040 align:start position:0%
somehow
 
04:58:47.990 --> 04:58:48.000 align:start position:0%
reward you for improvement
 
04:58:50.390 --> 04:58:50.400 align:start position:0%
that was at any rate that was just an
 
04:58:52.788 --> 04:58:52.798 align:start position:0%
idea to bounce around
 
04:58:55.110 --> 04:58:55.120 align:start position:0%
i don't even think i'd commented on it
 
04:58:56.550 --> 04:58:56.560 align:start position:0%
uh mr chair
 
04:58:56.560 --> 04:58:57.430 align:start position:0%
uh mr chair
yes

04:58:57.430 --> 04:58:57.440 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:58:59.590 --> 04:58:59.600 align:start position:0%
um so so i think what you're talking
 
04:59:01.670 --> 04:59:01.680 align:start position:0%
about here with cte is is really
 
04:59:01.680 --> 04:59:02.708 align:start position:0%
about here with cte is is really
important

04:59:02.708 --> 04:59:02.718 align:start position:0%
important
 
04:59:05.590 --> 04:59:05.600 align:start position:0%
and um but you know it's all part of the
 
04:59:06.708 --> 04:59:06.718 align:start position:0%
it's all part of the problem we're
 
04:59:09.270 --> 04:59:09.280 align:start position:0%
trying to solve you know getting getting
 
04:59:13.030 --> 04:59:13.040 align:start position:0%
districts to be able to um to to fund to
 
04:59:14.708 --> 04:59:14.718 align:start position:0%
to reach a funding
 
04:59:16.708 --> 04:59:16.718 align:start position:0%
uh point or have the have the
 
04:59:19.510 --> 04:59:19.520 align:start position:0%
availability of funds to fund their cte
 
04:59:21.750 --> 04:59:21.760 align:start position:0%
programs it's the same problem districts
 
04:59:24.310 --> 04:59:24.320 align:start position:0%
have about funding all their educational
 
04:59:28.470 --> 04:59:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:29.830 --> 04:59:29.840 align:start position:0%
and you know the
 
04:59:33.430 --> 04:59:33.440 align:start position:0%
the the fact that that are our cost of
 
04:59:36.070 --> 04:59:36.080 align:start position:0%
inadequate education the way it's set up
 
04:59:37.830 --> 04:59:37.840 align:start position:0%
right now and the way it's been defined
 
04:59:41.990 --> 04:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
for um you know for for for decades now
 
04:59:44.788 --> 04:59:44.798 align:start position:0%
it's just so far off of the um the
 
04:59:47.670 --> 04:59:47.680 align:start position:0%
actual cost whether it's cte or whether
 
04:59:49.830 --> 04:59:49.840 align:start position:0%
it's other educational programs
 
04:59:51.110 --> 04:59:51.120 align:start position:0%
and um
 
04:59:53.270 --> 04:59:53.280 align:start position:0%
and i think you know more important than
 
04:59:54.628 --> 04:59:54.638 align:start position:0%
anything else
 
04:59:57.990 --> 04:59:58.000 align:start position:0%
is it and and whether it's cte or
 
04:59:59.750 --> 04:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
whether it's anything else
 
05:00:02.628 --> 05:00:02.638 align:start position:0%
um is uh is making sure that districts
 
05:00:05.590 --> 05:00:05.600 align:start position:0%
number one that that that that that
 
05:00:09.110 --> 05:00:09.120 align:start position:0%
estimated cost be the um you know
 
05:00:12.310 --> 05:00:12.320 align:start position:0%
somewhat closer to accurate and or real
 
05:00:15.030 --> 05:00:15.040 align:start position:0%
and number two that we that we use the
 
05:00:17.670 --> 05:00:17.680 align:start position:0%
limited state dollars to be able to help
 
05:00:20.470 --> 05:00:20.480 align:start position:0%
districts get there and um you know
 
05:00:22.310 --> 05:00:22.320 align:start position:0%
right now we're basically you know
 
05:00:24.948 --> 05:00:24.958 align:start position:0%
throwing a pile of cash to for every
 
05:00:27.430 --> 05:00:27.440 align:start position:0%
every student it's the same you know on
 
05:00:29.750 --> 05:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
average what is it 4 600 bucks here you
 
05:00:31.190 --> 05:00:31.200 align:start position:0%
go good luck
 
05:00:33.990 --> 05:00:34.000 align:start position:0%
and um and that doesn't do anything for
 
05:00:36.708 --> 05:00:36.718 align:start position:0%
um uh for districts that need the extra
 
05:00:36.718 --> 05:00:37.510 align:start position:0%
um uh for districts that need the extra
help

05:00:37.510 --> 05:00:37.520 align:start position:0%
help
 
05:00:40.150 --> 05:00:40.160 align:start position:0%
um so you know these are the things that
 
05:00:43.030 --> 05:00:43.040 align:start position:0%
that and again it's absolutely true of
 
05:00:43.040 --> 05:00:44.470 align:start position:0%
that and again it's absolutely true of
cte

05:00:44.470 --> 05:00:44.480 align:start position:0%
cte
 
05:00:48.628 --> 05:00:48.638 align:start position:0%
um but it's it's it's true the entire
 
05:00:48.638 --> 05:00:51.510 align:start position:0%
um but it's it's it's true the entire
program

05:00:51.510 --> 05:00:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:53.670 --> 05:00:53.680 align:start position:0%
you know it's it's a hard one to crack
 
05:00:55.350 --> 05:00:55.360 align:start position:0%
you know we're dealing with
 
05:00:57.190 --> 05:00:57.200 align:start position:0%
you know all these constitutional
 
05:00:57.200 --> 05:00:58.708 align:start position:0%
you know all these constitutional
decisions

05:00:58.708 --> 05:00:58.718 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
05:00:58.718 --> 05:00:59.510 align:start position:0%
decisions
and

05:00:59.510 --> 05:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:01:01.030 --> 05:01:01.040 align:start position:0%
and and uh
 
05:01:02.948 --> 05:01:02.958 align:start position:0%
trying to weave
 
05:01:04.628 --> 05:01:04.638 align:start position:0%
a path through them
 
05:01:06.628 --> 05:01:06.638 align:start position:0%
where you can quote one but then there's
 
05:01:08.788 --> 05:01:08.798 align:start position:0%
another one saying that we can't slight
 
05:01:10.788 --> 05:01:10.798 align:start position:0%
those even the property poor towns or
 
05:01:12.948 --> 05:01:12.958 align:start position:0%
the property wealthy towns
 
05:01:15.270 --> 05:01:15.280 align:start position:0%
does that we have to support adequacy to
 
05:01:16.470 --> 05:01:16.480 align:start position:0%
them all
 
05:01:20.310 --> 05:01:20.320 align:start position:0%
and and so to shift dollars you know
 
05:01:22.230 --> 05:01:22.240 align:start position:0%
they're there you're trying to you know
 
05:01:24.390 --> 05:01:24.400 align:start position:0%
walk through this minefield
 
05:01:26.868 --> 05:01:26.878 align:start position:0%
and and i i think that's one of the
 
05:01:29.350 --> 05:01:29.360 align:start position:0%
the issues and there's so many of them
 
05:01:31.270 --> 05:01:31.280 align:start position:0%
you mentioned the categoricals at the
 
05:01:33.110 --> 05:01:33.120 align:start position:0%
beginning there we have the same issue
 
05:01:35.910 --> 05:01:35.920 align:start position:0%
with cat aid we have the same issue with
 
05:01:37.190 --> 05:01:37.200 align:start position:0%
building aid
 
05:01:41.990 --> 05:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
uh as we do with this area cte aid
 
05:01:44.628 --> 05:01:44.638 align:start position:0%
and it's all funding oriented
 
05:01:46.708 --> 05:01:46.718 align:start position:0%
uh we have the same issue with capital
 
05:01:49.030 --> 05:01:49.040 align:start position:0%
projects for cte programs rotating them
 
05:01:50.868 --> 05:01:50.878 align:start position:0%
every 28 years
 
05:01:53.430 --> 05:01:53.440 align:start position:0%
on the 28th year your place is looking
 
05:01:55.030 --> 05:01:55.040 align:start position:0%
like that garage in the street that's no
 
05:01:56.868 --> 05:01:56.878 align:start position:0%
longer in business
 
05:02:01.030 --> 05:02:01.040 align:start position:0%
uh so you know i we we have a huge issue
 
05:02:03.430 --> 05:02:03.440 align:start position:0%
in terms of how we look at education
 
05:02:03.440 --> 05:02:04.470 align:start position:0%
in terms of how we look at education
but

05:02:04.470 --> 05:02:04.480 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:02:06.708 --> 05:02:06.718 align:start position:0%
my suggestion is that we look at it we
 
05:02:08.788 --> 05:02:08.798 align:start position:0%
have to prioritize and we're not going
 
05:02:10.948 --> 05:02:10.958 align:start position:0%
to be able to do it all
 
05:02:13.190 --> 05:02:13.200 align:start position:0%
brett miler had his hand up
 
05:02:13.200 --> 05:02:13.990 align:start position:0%
brett miler had his hand up
and

05:02:13.990 --> 05:02:14.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:02:16.390 --> 05:02:16.400 align:start position:0%
yeah i think that's it miler i just want
 
05:02:18.230 --> 05:02:18.240 align:start position:0%
to comment on a couple things that we've
 
05:02:19.990 --> 05:02:20.000 align:start position:0%
been talking about
 
05:02:23.190 --> 05:02:23.200 align:start position:0%
one one of the things we found is that
 
05:02:25.510 --> 05:02:25.520 align:start position:0%
some of the uh communities
 
05:02:26.628 --> 05:02:26.638 align:start position:0%
that have
 
05:02:28.948 --> 05:02:28.958 align:start position:0%
poor property value are making a
 
05:02:31.190 --> 05:02:31.200 align:start position:0%
tremendous effort
 
05:02:33.990 --> 05:02:34.000 align:start position:0%
in trying to be competitive with
 
05:02:35.990 --> 05:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
surrounding towns
 
05:02:38.628 --> 05:02:38.638 align:start position:0%
and and yet in their effort they still
 
05:02:40.788 --> 05:02:40.798 align:start position:0%
fall far short
 
05:02:42.708 --> 05:02:42.718 align:start position:0%
one of the things we did find that in
 
05:02:45.430 --> 05:02:45.440 align:start position:0%
the in this study over the summer
 
05:02:47.350 --> 05:02:47.360 align:start position:0%
is that there was a question regarding
 
05:02:48.788 --> 05:02:48.798 align:start position:0%
about well how do you value this
 
05:02:48.798 --> 05:02:49.990 align:start position:0%
about well how do you value this
property

05:02:49.990 --> 05:02:50.000 align:start position:0%
property
 
05:02:52.470 --> 05:02:52.480 align:start position:0%
i mean what's the value of of a a
 
05:02:55.670 --> 05:02:55.680 align:start position:0%
newport versus a hopkinton for example
 
05:02:56.788 --> 05:02:56.798 align:start position:0%
and one of the things that the
 
05:02:58.708 --> 05:02:58.718 align:start position:0%
department of revenue administration has
 
05:03:01.190 --> 05:03:01.200 align:start position:0%
created and this is fairly new
 
05:03:02.868 --> 05:03:02.878 align:start position:0%
that they now have a system it's called
 
05:03:04.788 --> 05:03:04.798 align:start position:0%
the mosaic system
 
05:03:07.110 --> 05:03:07.120 align:start position:0%
that basically provides much greater
 
05:03:10.470 --> 05:03:10.480 align:start position:0%
equity as relates to how you evaluate
 
05:03:13.830 --> 05:03:13.840 align:start position:0%
property so that's that's a real plus
 
05:03:15.030 --> 05:03:15.040 align:start position:0%
the other thing that was mentioned
 
05:03:17.350 --> 05:03:17.360 align:start position:0%
earlier and that is how do you deal with
 
05:03:19.670 --> 05:03:19.680 align:start position:0%
people who just can't afford stuff
 
05:03:22.390 --> 05:03:22.400 align:start position:0%
and the commission did look took a long
 
05:03:24.070 --> 05:03:24.080 align:start position:0%
look at the issue
 
05:03:26.470 --> 05:03:26.480 align:start position:0%
of of how do you get some property tax
 
05:03:26.480 --> 05:03:27.510 align:start position:0%
of of how do you get some property tax
relief

05:03:27.510 --> 05:03:27.520 align:start position:0%
relief
 
05:03:29.350 --> 05:03:29.360 align:start position:0%
and what we found was that the current
 
05:03:31.670 --> 05:03:31.680 align:start position:0%
program there is a current program
 
05:03:33.190 --> 05:03:33.200 align:start position:0%
that it really hadn't been looked at for
 
05:03:35.590 --> 05:03:35.600 align:start position:0%
over 20 years and the dra
 
05:03:38.230 --> 05:03:38.240 align:start position:0%
basically said this needs to be revised
 
05:03:41.350 --> 05:03:41.360 align:start position:0%
and so there is a bill of house bill 504
 
05:03:42.550 --> 05:03:42.560 align:start position:0%
that's currently
 
05:03:44.470 --> 05:03:44.480 align:start position:0%
before the legislature
 
05:03:46.708 --> 05:03:46.718 align:start position:0%
that will address the issue of property
 
05:03:46.718 --> 05:03:47.670 align:start position:0%
that will address the issue of property
tax

05:03:47.670 --> 05:03:47.680 align:start position:0%
tax
 
05:03:49.270 --> 05:03:49.280 align:start position:0%
that will move
 
05:03:51.910 --> 05:03:51.920 align:start position:0%
the potential of somebody being able to
 
05:03:54.708 --> 05:03:54.718 align:start position:0%
get a thousand dollars
 
05:03:57.270 --> 05:03:57.280 align:start position:0%
rebate in their taxes to try to help
 
05:03:59.030 --> 05:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
with deal with that issue
 
05:04:00.868 --> 05:04:00.878 align:start position:0%
so the commission looked at both the
 
05:04:03.190 --> 05:04:03.200 align:start position:0%
issue of not only what we're looking at
 
05:04:05.110 --> 05:04:05.120 align:start position:0%
right here as far as the funding
 
05:04:07.590 --> 05:04:07.600 align:start position:0%
but how is the funding generated what
 
05:04:09.270 --> 05:04:09.280 align:start position:0%
are the options for it
 
05:04:10.948 --> 05:04:10.958 align:start position:0%
and i think that was in representative
 
05:04:13.110 --> 05:04:13.120 align:start position:0%
moffat talked about the issue of poor
 
05:04:13.120 --> 05:04:14.150 align:start position:0%
moffat talked about the issue of poor
towns

05:04:14.150 --> 05:04:14.160 align:start position:0%
towns
 
05:04:16.070 --> 05:04:16.080 align:start position:0%
this is a problem it's not that the poor
 
05:04:17.670 --> 05:04:17.680 align:start position:0%
towns aren't making an effort they're
 
05:04:19.510 --> 05:04:19.520 align:start position:0%
making a heck of an effort
 
05:04:22.310 --> 05:04:22.320 align:start position:0%
but they just can't raise the money
 
05:04:25.510 --> 05:04:25.520 align:start position:0%
as much as you can a wealthy town
 
05:04:27.190 --> 05:04:27.200 align:start position:0%
and the the thing that's important here
 
05:04:28.550 --> 05:04:28.560 align:start position:0%
is that when you begin to look at
 
05:04:31.750 --> 05:04:31.760 align:start position:0%
outcome-based assessment
 
05:04:32.948 --> 05:04:32.958 align:start position:0%
you can
 
05:04:35.190 --> 05:04:35.200 align:start position:0%
then if a property if a property poor
 
05:04:38.150 --> 05:04:38.160 align:start position:0%
town begins to get additional money
 
05:04:40.628 --> 05:04:40.638 align:start position:0%
you can actually then begin to say are
 
05:04:42.230 --> 05:04:42.240 align:start position:0%
they improving
 
05:04:44.070 --> 05:04:44.080 align:start position:0%
over a period of time it's not gonna
 
05:04:46.390 --> 05:04:46.400 align:start position:0%
it's not a magic wand here but over a
 
05:04:48.708 --> 05:04:48.718 align:start position:0%
period of three to five years if they
 
05:04:51.190 --> 05:04:51.200 align:start position:0%
begin to get additional resources and
 
05:04:53.670 --> 05:04:53.680 align:start position:0%
allocate those resources in a way those
 
05:04:53.680 --> 05:04:54.628 align:start position:0%
allocate those resources in a way those
students

05:04:54.628 --> 05:04:54.638 align:start position:0%
students
 
05:04:57.510 --> 05:04:57.520 align:start position:0%
should be able to improve and in fact in
 
05:04:59.270 --> 05:04:59.280 align:start position:0%
the couple of the states that this is in
 
05:05:01.350 --> 05:05:01.360 align:start position:0%
kansas et cetera where they have done
 
05:05:04.310 --> 05:05:04.320 align:start position:0%
this the students have in fact improved
 
05:05:06.230 --> 05:05:06.240 align:start position:0%
with that additional income and
 
05:05:08.390 --> 05:05:08.400 align:start position:0%
additional support from the state thank
 
05:05:08.400 --> 05:05:10.708 align:start position:0%
additional support from the state thank
you

05:05:10.708 --> 05:05:10.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:12.708 --> 05:05:12.718 align:start position:0%
is there more is there anything else for
 
05:05:14.708 --> 05:05:14.718 align:start position:0%
the uh discussion here it's a good
 
05:05:14.718 --> 05:05:15.990 align:start position:0%
the uh discussion here it's a good
discussion

05:05:15.990 --> 05:05:16.000 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
05:05:17.510 --> 05:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
uh and it's of course you know we're
 
05:05:19.270 --> 05:05:19.280 align:start position:0%
gonna get to have to get some resolution
 
05:05:21.270 --> 05:05:21.280 align:start position:0%
here seeing that
 
05:05:24.070 --> 05:05:24.080 align:start position:0%
we'll be creating hp1 and hb2 shortly
 
05:05:24.080 --> 05:05:25.030 align:start position:0%
we'll be creating hp1 and hb2 shortly
here

05:05:25.030 --> 05:05:25.040 align:start position:0%
here
 
05:05:25.040 --> 05:05:25.910 align:start position:0%
here
um

05:05:25.910 --> 05:05:25.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:05:28.150 --> 05:05:28.160 align:start position:0%
and and all this is going to contribute
 
05:05:29.910 --> 05:05:29.920 align:start position:0%
to it
 
05:05:29.920 --> 05:05:30.788 align:start position:0%
to it
rick

05:05:30.788 --> 05:05:30.798 align:start position:0%
rick
 
05:05:34.628 --> 05:05:34.638 align:start position:0%
yes yeah so so um just in the in the
 
05:05:36.708 --> 05:05:36.718 align:start position:0%
big picture of things obviously you know
 
05:05:39.270 --> 05:05:39.280 align:start position:0%
we just heard 608 that's
 
05:05:42.550 --> 05:05:42.560 align:start position:0%
in this in this basket of bills
 
05:05:45.430 --> 05:05:45.440 align:start position:0%
um so is um senator hennessey's bill
 
05:05:48.070 --> 05:05:48.080 align:start position:0%
senate bill 135
 
05:05:51.270 --> 05:05:51.280 align:start position:0%
senator conn's bill 145.
 
05:05:51.280 --> 05:05:52.230 align:start position:0%
senator conn's bill 145.
um

05:05:52.230 --> 05:05:52.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:05:55.030 --> 05:05:55.040 align:start position:0%
senator carncon's comprehensive bill
 
05:05:58.230 --> 05:05:58.240 align:start position:0%
senate bill 158
 
05:06:01.750 --> 05:06:01.760 align:start position:0%
house bill 623 i think was just retained
 
05:06:04.868 --> 05:06:04.878 align:start position:0%
in um in the finance committee
 
05:06:09.030 --> 05:06:09.040 align:start position:0%
this morning and that's an fy 22
 
05:06:12.070 --> 05:06:12.080 align:start position:0%
23 hold harmless um bill
 
05:06:13.750 --> 05:06:13.760 align:start position:0%
sort of what uh
 
05:06:15.030 --> 05:06:15.040 align:start position:0%
what um
 
05:06:17.110 --> 05:06:17.120 align:start position:0%
mr mc lynch was talking about you know
 
05:06:18.708 --> 05:06:18.718 align:start position:0%
we've seen sort of an artificial
 
05:06:20.868 --> 05:06:20.878 align:start position:0%
collapse in student enrollment during
 
05:06:24.628 --> 05:06:24.638 align:start position:0%
the pandemic that would you know
 
05:06:27.110 --> 05:06:27.120 align:start position:0%
drive the uh the adequacy
 
05:06:30.150 --> 05:06:30.160 align:start position:0%
uh funding for the next school year and
 
05:06:33.190 --> 05:06:33.200 align:start position:0%
so fixing that so these the the there's
 
05:06:35.670 --> 05:06:35.680 align:start position:0%
there's there's a package of bills all
 
05:06:39.190 --> 05:06:39.200 align:start position:0%
in here and um you know like i said i
 
05:06:40.708 --> 05:06:40.718 align:start position:0%
like to say you know there's a pony in
 
05:06:43.590 --> 05:06:43.600 align:start position:0%
here somewhere and um
 
05:06:45.910 --> 05:06:45.920 align:start position:0%
and you know uh but these are things
 
05:06:47.590 --> 05:06:47.600 align:start position:0%
that i hope members of this committee
 
05:06:49.030 --> 05:06:49.040 align:start position:0%
are gonna gonna
 
05:06:51.430 --> 05:06:51.440 align:start position:0%
take a look at following closely not all
 
05:06:52.788 --> 05:06:52.798 align:start position:0%
of them are going to be coming through
 
05:06:54.550 --> 05:06:54.560 align:start position:0%
this committee
 
05:06:57.030 --> 05:06:57.040 align:start position:0%
yeah you know i recognize that i i knew
 
05:06:58.390 --> 05:06:58.400 align:start position:0%
you had uh
 
05:07:01.990 --> 05:07:02.000 align:start position:0%
the uh bill at the hold harmless at 623
 
05:07:03.510 --> 05:07:03.520 align:start position:0%
over there that's what was in waste
 
05:07:03.520 --> 05:07:04.470 align:start position:0%
over there that's what was in waste
means

05:07:04.470 --> 05:07:04.480 align:start position:0%
means
 
05:07:07.990 --> 05:07:08.000 align:start position:0%
uh finance fine excuse me finance yeah
 
05:07:08.000 --> 05:07:08.708 align:start position:0%
uh finance fine excuse me finance yeah
um

05:07:08.708 --> 05:07:08.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:07:11.430 --> 05:07:11.440 align:start position:0%
yeah and i i i somewhere along the way i
 
05:07:13.990 --> 05:07:14.000 align:start position:0%
i we're going to have to come up to
 
05:07:15.430 --> 05:07:15.440 align:start position:0%
agreement on
 
05:07:17.990 --> 05:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
some of those broad
 
05:07:20.150 --> 05:07:20.160 align:start position:0%
broad elements that we've been in our
 
05:07:22.868 --> 05:07:22.878 align:start position:0%
formulas in the past i for one can say
 
05:07:25.910 --> 05:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
right now i'm not a fan of stabilization
 
05:07:28.070 --> 05:07:28.080 align:start position:0%
and i never have been stabilization
 
05:07:29.670 --> 05:07:29.680 align:start position:0%
becomes permanent
 
05:07:29.680 --> 05:07:30.628 align:start position:0%
becomes permanent
um

05:07:30.628 --> 05:07:30.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:07:30.638 --> 05:07:31.430 align:start position:0%
um
it's

05:07:31.430 --> 05:07:31.440 align:start position:0%
it's
 
05:07:34.708 --> 05:07:34.718 align:start position:0%
something we've used we used it the 2008
 
05:07:38.070 --> 05:07:38.080 align:start position:0%
formula had a hold harmless in it not to
 
05:07:40.230 --> 05:07:40.240 align:start position:0%
the same degree i think it was only it
 
05:07:41.910 --> 05:07:41.920 align:start position:0%
was underneath 30 million dollars
 
05:07:45.030 --> 05:07:45.040 align:start position:0%
probably around 25 26 million dollars
 
05:07:47.270 --> 05:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
and and and then
 
05:07:49.510 --> 05:07:49.520 align:start position:0%
we have stabilization was created and
 
05:07:52.868 --> 05:07:52.878 align:start position:0%
then you know back what 2012
 
05:07:54.470 --> 05:07:54.480 align:start position:0%
um and then
 
05:07:56.948 --> 05:07:56.958 align:start position:0%
slowly eliminated and people were
 
05:07:58.948 --> 05:07:58.958 align:start position:0%
learning to live off of that
 
05:08:01.350 --> 05:08:01.360 align:start position:0%
and and to compound it we have this
 
05:08:03.830 --> 05:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
really decreasing demographic
 
05:08:06.310 --> 05:08:06.320 align:start position:0%
uh which is and and we still have this
 
05:08:08.788 --> 05:08:08.798 align:start position:0%
per capita formula you know somewhere a
 
05:08:10.470 --> 05:08:10.480 align:start position:0%
long way i was just hoping maybe we can
 
05:08:13.910 --> 05:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
get a formula be a built upon program
 
05:08:15.670 --> 05:08:15.680 align:start position:0%
rather than per capita but i don't think
 
05:08:17.750 --> 05:08:17.760 align:start position:0%
that's going to happen that's just a
 
05:08:20.788 --> 05:08:20.798 align:start position:0%
monster of a task and
 
05:08:22.948 --> 05:08:22.958 align:start position:0%
i can't see it so
 
05:08:25.190 --> 05:08:25.200 align:start position:0%
dave we got a long way to go here and
 
05:08:27.110 --> 05:08:27.120 align:start position:0%
somewhere in these bills i hope we do
 
05:08:28.868 --> 05:08:28.878 align:start position:0%
find that that
 
05:08:32.628 --> 05:08:32.638 align:start position:0%
point that's going to contribute to hb1
 
05:08:35.910 --> 05:08:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:38.390 --> 05:08:38.400 align:start position:0%
who knows what it's going to look like
 
05:08:38.400 --> 05:08:40.310 align:start position:0%
who knows what it's going to look like
so

05:08:40.310 --> 05:08:40.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:08:42.150 --> 05:08:42.160 align:start position:0%
let's it's going to be the fight is
 
05:08:46.070 --> 05:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
going to occur in division two
 
05:08:47.430 --> 05:08:47.440 align:start position:0%
and then on the floor
 
05:08:47.440 --> 05:08:49.430 align:start position:0%
and then on the floor
um

05:08:49.430 --> 05:08:49.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:08:51.110 --> 05:08:51.120 align:start position:0%
i don't have anything else to say today
 
05:08:53.430 --> 05:08:53.440 align:start position:0%
guys you know i've said this for for
 
05:08:55.030 --> 05:08:55.040 align:start position:0%
months and months and months and i know
 
05:08:57.030 --> 05:08:57.040 align:start position:0%
others right here have done the same
 
05:09:00.628 --> 05:09:00.638 align:start position:0%
thing so it's uh
 
05:09:02.390 --> 05:09:02.400 align:start position:0%
so is it time to call it quits for the
 
05:09:02.400 --> 05:09:06.550 align:start position:0%
so is it time to call it quits for the
day

05:09:06.550 --> 05:09:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:08.788 --> 05:09:08.798 align:start position:0%
i see mel going up and down so i guess
 
05:09:11.110 --> 05:09:11.120 align:start position:0%
it is
 
05:09:11.120 --> 05:09:11.510 align:start position:0%
it is
this um

05:09:11.510 --> 05:09:11.520 align:start position:0%
this um
 
05:09:13.190 --> 05:09:13.200 align:start position:0%
this is representative uh just to let
 
05:09:15.110 --> 05:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
you know my
 
05:09:17.510 --> 05:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
checking with uh litchfield uh facebook
 
05:09:19.270 --> 05:09:19.280 align:start position:0%
page other people have had internet
 
05:09:22.948 --> 05:09:22.958 align:start position:0%
problems from 10 15 it seems to like one
 
05:09:22.958 --> 05:09:24.070 align:start position:0%
problems from 10 15 it seems to like one
so

05:09:24.070 --> 05:09:24.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:09:27.030 --> 05:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
and since one i've been okay so
 
05:09:29.270 --> 05:09:29.280 align:start position:0%
so i'm sorry i missed that one vote this
 
05:09:31.190 --> 05:09:31.200 align:start position:0%
morning right right when you're ready to
 
05:09:34.948 --> 05:09:34.958 align:start position:0%
vote bam the internet goes so anyway
 
05:09:37.110 --> 05:09:37.120 align:start position:0%
i've had that same quote i've had that
 
05:09:39.190 --> 05:09:39.200 align:start position:0%
same problem ralph today too thank you
 
05:09:41.350 --> 05:09:41.360 align:start position:0%
