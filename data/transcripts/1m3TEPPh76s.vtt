you uh dear chairman abbas or chairman
 
00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 align:start position:0%
roy and honorable members of the
 
00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 align:start position:0%
committee the new hampshire sheriff's
 
00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 align:start position:0%
association asked me to bring forward
 
00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 align:start position:0%
senate bill 303 relative to
 
00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 align:start position:0%
reimbursement of sheriff's offices
 
00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 align:start position:0%
for prisoner custody and control the
 
00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:51.599 align:start position:0%
sheriff's departments are reimbursed by
 
00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
the courts for providing prisoner
 
00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 align:start position:0%
custody and control services these
 
00:02:56.869 --> 00:02:56.879 align:start position:0%
services include transporting prisoners
 
00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 align:start position:0%
and staying with them at their hearings
 
00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 align:start position:0%
in the courthouse the sheriffs are
 
00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 align:start position:0%
currently reimbursed about half of what
 
00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 align:start position:0%
the current per diem rate is for bailiff
 
00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:06.879 align:start position:0%
service in the courthouse this bill
 
00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 align:start position:0%
would bring parity between the two rates
 
00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 align:start position:0%
and fix an oversight in the budget
 
00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 align:start position:0%
although the bill has a fiscal note
 
00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 align:start position:0%
there is no additional appropriation for
 
00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 align:start position:0%
the rate increase with the increase in
 
00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 align:start position:0%
virtual court services the instances of
 
00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 align:start position:0%
custody and control are going down
 
00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.360 align:start position:0%
the budget amount appropriated to the
 
00:03:24.869 --> 00:03:24.879 align:start position:0%
judicial branch for court security
 
00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 align:start position:0%
including custody and control can absorb
 
00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 align:start position:0%
the rate increase if virtual appearances
 
00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 align:start position:0%
continue at current rates
 
00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 align:start position:0%
representatives from the sheriff's
 
00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 align:start position:0%
departments are here to testify in favor
 
00:03:35.589 --> 00:03:35.599 align:start position:0%
of the bill and we'll be able to answer

the committee now calls christopher
 
00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:11.990 align:start position:0%
the committee now calls christopher
connolly

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:13.429 --> 00:04:13.439 align:start position:0%
good morning mr chairman and members of
 
00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 align:start position:0%
the committee thank you for the
 
00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak uh
 
00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120 align:start position:0%
before you on um
 
00:04:21.189 --> 00:04:21.199 align:start position:0%
uh senate bill 303
 
00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 align:start position:0%
um for those of you that are not
 
00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 align:start position:0%
familiar uh the sheriff's office
 
00:04:27.189 --> 00:04:27.199 align:start position:0%
provides custody and control uh within
 
00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 align:start position:0%
our courthouses in the state so
 
00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:31.040 align:start position:0%
essentially what that means is uh we
 
00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:32.479 align:start position:0%
move inmates
 
00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 align:start position:0%
from the various correctional facilities
 
00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
to their court appearances at the
 
00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 align:start position:0%
different courts we have court offices
 
00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:39.440 align:start position:0%
that provide
 
00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840 align:start position:0%
custody and control
 
00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 align:start position:0%
for those folks once they arrive at the
 
00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:45.919 align:start position:0%
courthouses so that means that they work
 
00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:48.080 align:start position:0%
in the cell blocks they remove the
 
00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:49.189 align:start position:0%
in the cell blocks they remove the
inmates

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:49.199 align:start position:0%
inmates
 
00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:50.240 align:start position:0%
from the
 
00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.280 align:start position:0%
cell holding areas transport them back
 
00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:55.280 align:start position:0%
and forth within the courthouse to the
 
00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 align:start position:0%
various courtrooms in the building so
 
00:04:59.909 --> 00:04:59.919 align:start position:0%
this is a inherently uh difficult and
 
00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:01.600 align:start position:0%
dangerous job
 
00:05:03.749 --> 00:05:03.759 align:start position:0%
so certainly we feel that they should be
 
00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
reimbursed at the same rate
 
00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:08.160 align:start position:0%
as other court security officer
 
00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.270 align:start position:0%
as other court security officer
functions

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.280 align:start position:0%
functions
 
00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:11.360 align:start position:0%
is currently at about half of
 
00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:13.919 align:start position:0%
that as mr bosse indicated
 
00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:15.680 align:start position:0%
when he introduced the
 
00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240 align:start position:0%
the bill on senator hennessey's behalf
 
00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:18.950 align:start position:0%
the bill on senator hennessey's behalf
so

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
really what we're doing is seeking
 
00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
parity for those inherently difficult
 
00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:25.520 align:start position:0%
jobs and dangerous jobs that these folks
 
00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.189 align:start position:0%
jobs and dangerous jobs that these folks
perform

00:05:27.189 --> 00:05:27.199 align:start position:0%
perform
 
00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 align:start position:0%
we have a great difficulty
 
00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:30.790 align:start position:0%
we have a great difficulty
in

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:30.800 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:32.639 align:start position:0%
recruiting and retaining folks for these
 
00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:34.390 align:start position:0%
recruiting and retaining folks for these
positions

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:34.400 align:start position:0%
positions
 
00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:36.720 align:start position:0%
you know when folks can look at for
 
00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:38.400 align:start position:0%
instance the posting possibly from
 
00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.080 align:start position:0%
dunkin donuts or one of the fast food
 
00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:42.800 align:start position:0%
chains uh and look at that type of work
 
00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:45.680 align:start position:0%
as compared to moving some potentially
 
00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:47.440 align:start position:0%
violent and dangerous individuals around
 
00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
a court uh house it certainly does not
 
00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:52.880 align:start position:0%
always make an attractive proposition to
 
00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
work a custody control function
 
00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:57.680 align:start position:0%
so it's really important that we
 
00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.240 align:start position:0%
try to achieve parity with the pay that
 
00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
our folks that are moving these
 
00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:05.120 align:start position:0%
dangerous folks within our courtrooms
 
00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:07.440 align:start position:0%
are are performing those duties and
 
00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:09.600 align:start position:0%
they're also uh obviously during the
 
00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:11.360 align:start position:0%
performance of those duties ensuring the
 
00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:13.840 align:start position:0%
safety uh of those attending for a court
 
00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:16.160 align:start position:0%
appearance uh the judge attorneys uh
 
00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:18.160 align:start position:0%
witnesses jurors and things like that so
 
00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:20.160 align:start position:0%
it's an extremely important
 
00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:22.240 align:start position:0%
function that they perform
 
00:06:29.029 --> 00:06:29.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um could you tell
 
00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:39.600 align:start position:0%
me sir what was done before
 
00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:41.600 align:start position:0%
uh this is the first i've ever heard of
 
00:06:48.309 --> 00:06:48.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:50.560 align:start position:0%
there we go okay uh so the state
 
00:06:52.469 --> 00:06:52.479 align:start position:0%
actually has been reimbursing uh the
 
00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
counties um
 
00:06:55.749 --> 00:06:55.759 align:start position:0%
for custody and control but it's been at
 
00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:57.440 align:start position:0%
a different rate so the rate of
 
00:06:59.189 --> 00:06:59.199 align:start position:0%
reimbursement is about half what the
 
00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
state reimburses other court officer
 
00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:04.960 align:start position:0%
functions for so um for many years
 
00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
there's been a disparity in that pay so
 
00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:10.400 align:start position:0%
this actually is not a new concept
 
00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
in the state reimbursing for the
 
00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:14.800 align:start position:0%
services provided by the court officers
 
00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:16.880 align:start position:0%
but what it is is um
 
00:07:19.029 --> 00:07:19.039 align:start position:0%
attempt to achieve parity in what they
 
00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:21.120 align:start position:0%
are being paid
 
00:07:23.589 --> 00:07:23.599 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome
 
00:07:25.589 --> 00:07:25.599 align:start position:0%
a question from the chair
 
00:07:25.599 --> 00:07:26.950 align:start position:0%
a question from the chair
um

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:26.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:29.440 align:start position:0%
are these officers are they sheriff's
 
00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:31.120 align:start position:0%
deputies are they part of the sheriff's
 
00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:32.790 align:start position:0%
deputies are they part of the sheriff's
department

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:32.800 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:34.720 align:start position:0%
so they um work for the sheriff's
 
00:07:37.189 --> 00:07:37.199 align:start position:0%
department but they are court officers
 
00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:39.680 align:start position:0%
uh the vast majority are not sworn so
 
00:07:41.589 --> 00:07:41.599 align:start position:0%
they're not deputy sheriffs that per
 
00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:44.720 align:start position:0%
diem uh court officers that that come in
 
00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:46.800 align:start position:0%
and work as needed for us in those
 
00:07:48.309 --> 00:07:48.319 align:start position:0%
various roles
 
00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:50.960 align:start position:0%
okay so they're not they're not salaried
 
00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:54.080 align:start position:0%
employees with benefits and such as part
 
00:07:55.589 --> 00:07:55.599 align:start position:0%
of the sheriff's department that is
 
00:07:58.150 --> 00:07:58.160 align:start position:0%
correct they're per diem no benefits uh
 
00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:00.720 align:start position:0%
received by these folks okay one last
 
00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:02.400 align:start position:0%
thing i don't know if you said when you
 
00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
started if you could just say your name
 
00:08:05.909 --> 00:08:05.919 align:start position:0%
and your position don't buy apologize mr
 
00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:07.360 align:start position:0%
chair yes my name is christopher
 
00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:09.440 align:start position:0%
connolly i'm the hillsborough county
 
00:08:11.189 --> 00:08:11.199 align:start position:0%
sheriff i've been new hampshire law
 
00:08:13.749 --> 00:08:13.759 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer for uh just about 35
 
00:08:14.869 --> 00:08:14.879 align:start position:0%
years now
 
00:08:16.869 --> 00:08:16.879 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you mr chair
 
00:08:19.749 --> 00:08:19.759 align:start position:0%
any further uh yes representative burt
 
00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:21.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:23.360 align:start position:0%
coming today
 
00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:25.280 align:start position:0%
so currently they're only you know the
 
00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:28.720 align:start position:0%
state reimburses you about half the cost
 
00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:30.800 align:start position:0%
so once
 
00:08:32.389 --> 00:08:32.399 align:start position:0%
if this passed
 
00:08:34.310 --> 00:08:34.320 align:start position:0%
and was signed into law
 
00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
then would the money come from the
 
00:08:38.389 --> 00:08:38.399 align:start position:0%
county residents for each county and
 
00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:40.640 align:start position:0%
they would pay for their portion you
 
00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:41.670 align:start position:0%
they would pay for their portion you
know

00:08:41.670 --> 00:08:41.680 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:44.320 align:start position:0%
of those you know the duties here
 
00:08:47.269 --> 00:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
so currently uh custody and control uh
 
00:08:50.949 --> 00:08:50.959 align:start position:0%
court officers uh reimbursed at 65 a day
 
00:08:52.949 --> 00:08:52.959 align:start position:0%
in our perimeter and security which are
 
00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:54.800 align:start position:0%
the folks that uh that you would see at
 
00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:56.320 align:start position:0%
the front door for instance as you get
 
00:08:59.190 --> 00:08:59.200 align:start position:0%
screened through the magnetometer are uh
 
00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:00.880 align:start position:0%
reimbursed through the state at a rate
 
00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:03.040 align:start position:0%
of 121
 
00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:05.360 align:start position:0%
and uh change
 
00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:08.560 align:start position:0%
let's see 121 i'm sorry 120 dollars and
 
00:09:15.509 --> 00:09:15.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:17.200 align:start position:0%
so would the money still come from the
 
00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:19.600 align:start position:0%
state you know if this passes or will it
 
00:09:20.949 --> 00:09:20.959 align:start position:0%
come from the county so the
 
00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:22.800 align:start position:0%
reimbursement uh so what would this
 
00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:24.720 align:start position:0%
would do is increase the reimbursement
 
00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:27.360 align:start position:0%
for those custody and control positions
 
00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:29.440 align:start position:0%
that we receive from the state so the
 
00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:32.240 align:start position:0%
county uh bills uh that various counties
 
00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:34.480 align:start position:0%
bill the state um for those
 
00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:37.040 align:start position:0%
reimbursement services but the issue now
 
00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:38.720 align:start position:0%
is that the perimeter
 
00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:40.640 align:start position:0%
perimeter and security folks are
 
00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:42.880 align:start position:0%
reimbursed at one rate and the custody
 
00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:45.040 align:start position:0%
and control are reimbursed at a at a
 
00:09:47.269 --> 00:09:47.279 align:start position:0%
lesser rate about half
 
00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:48.880 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
and just to be clear the the services
 
00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
that these folks are providing are for
 
00:09:57.350 --> 00:09:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:00.389 --> 00:10:00.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
thank you it sounds like
 
00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
your current situation reimburses people
 
00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:06.160 align:start position:0%
about half what they could make at
 
00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:07.509 align:start position:0%
about half what they could make at
mcdonald's

00:10:07.509 --> 00:10:07.519 align:start position:0%
mcdonald's
 
00:10:09.269 --> 00:10:09.279 align:start position:0%
and this might bring you up to pretty
 
00:10:12.389 --> 00:10:12.399 align:start position:0%
close to parity with uh people that work
 
00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:14.720 align:start position:0%
in those types of jobs is that incorrect
 
00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:16.069 align:start position:0%
in those types of jobs is that incorrect
mathematics

00:10:16.069 --> 00:10:16.079 align:start position:0%
mathematics
 
00:10:18.069 --> 00:10:18.079 align:start position:0%
yes the pay is quite low for the
 
00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:19.680 align:start position:0%
responsibility and inherent danger
 
00:10:21.829 --> 00:10:21.839 align:start position:0%
involved in these positions for sure so
 
00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
this is just a pretty good step
 
00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:26.000 align:start position:0%
thank you yes that was just my opinion
 
00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:28.640 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry thank you
 
00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:30.640 align:start position:0%
another question to the chair if
 
00:10:32.389 --> 00:10:32.399 align:start position:0%
someone's injured performing those
 
00:10:34.949 --> 00:10:34.959 align:start position:0%
duties um are they paid
 
00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:37.120 align:start position:0%
for their injuries from the from the
 
00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:38.720 align:start position:0%
state or from the county so they
 
00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
actually would fall under uh workers
 
00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:42.150 align:start position:0%
actually would fall under uh workers
compensation

00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:42.160 align:start position:0%
compensation
 
00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:44.240 align:start position:0%
if those injuries you know were
 
00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
sustained during the course of their
 
00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:47.110 align:start position:0%
sustained during the course of their
duties

00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:47.120 align:start position:0%
duties
 
00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:49.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:50.800 align:start position:0%
there'd be no further questions oh one
 
00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:53.600 align:start position:0%
more go ahead representative
 
00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:55.600 align:start position:0%
uh thank you chair uh thank you protect
 
00:10:57.750 --> 00:10:57.760 align:start position:0%
my question absolutely
 
00:11:00.389 --> 00:11:00.399 align:start position:0%
so does a county ever
 
00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:02.320 align:start position:0%
supplement the pay
 
00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:04.720 align:start position:0%
for these people so it depends on the
 
00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
county um some counties do
 
00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:08.800 align:start position:0%
some don't
 
00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:11.120 align:start position:0%
some pay at additional rate
 
00:11:12.949 --> 00:11:12.959 align:start position:0%
if their county delegations authorize
 
00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:14.880 align:start position:0%
that so that which makes it a bit more
 
00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:16.150 align:start position:0%
that so that which makes it a bit more
attractive

00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:16.160 align:start position:0%
attractive
 
00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
obviously to recruit folks
 
00:11:21.269 --> 00:11:21.279 align:start position:0%
and some counties make up the difference
 
00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:23.920 align:start position:0%
uh currently from the 65 dollars to the
 
00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:26.000 align:start position:0%
120 for that parity so it's really the
 
00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:29.360 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rate that is not um
 
00:11:31.269 --> 00:11:31.279 align:start position:0%
on on power
 
00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
oh thank you i don't understand how you
 
00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:35.200 align:start position:0%
can recruit anybody to do those
 
00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:37.600 align:start position:0%
positions for such a low pay
 
00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:40.160 align:start position:0%
it is a challenge and it's getting more
 
00:11:42.069 --> 00:11:42.079 align:start position:0%
and more challenging thank you very much
 
00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:46.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
thank you uh
 
00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:55.760 align:start position:0%
isn't it true that the only
 
00:11:57.590 --> 00:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
court officers who are getting that high
 
00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:00.800 align:start position:0%
pay now work at the supreme court
 
00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
uh so i am not sure what the supreme
 
00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
court court officers make
 
00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
i know that the language in this bill
 
00:12:10.389 --> 00:12:10.399 align:start position:0%
refers to the um the administrative
 
00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:12.160 align:start position:0%
office of courts the contract that they
 
00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
have with their court officers so
 
00:12:15.829 --> 00:12:15.839 align:start position:0%
essentially it would bring all court
 
00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
officers into this um
 
00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:20.160 align:start position:0%
same pay scale and bring parity but i do
 
00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:21.920 align:start position:0%
not know what the supreme court folks
 
00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:23.670 align:start position:0%
not know what the supreme court folks
make

00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:23.680 align:start position:0%
make
 
00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:24.949 align:start position:0%
make
recall

00:12:24.949 --> 00:12:24.959 align:start position:0%
recall
 
00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
it took about three years to get you
 
00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:29.600 align:start position:0%
this payment in the first place so i'm
 
00:12:31.829 --> 00:12:31.839 align:start position:0%
i'm in favor of this would you believe
 
00:12:35.829 --> 00:12:35.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:38.720 align:start position:0%
yes representative newman yes
 
00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:40.720 align:start position:0%
thank you regarding your staffing how
 
00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
many people currently do you have doing
 
00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
this and how many would it how many
 
00:12:47.829 --> 00:12:47.839 align:start position:0%
would you ideally like to have
 
00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:50.000 align:start position:0%
uh that's gonna vary depending on the
 
00:12:52.389 --> 00:12:52.399 align:start position:0%
counties uh speaking for my county
 
00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:53.920 align:start position:0%
hillsborough county is the largest
 
00:12:56.230 --> 00:12:56.240 align:start position:0%
county we actually have two superior
 
00:12:58.310 --> 00:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
courthouses that we staff along with a
 
00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:01.360 align:start position:0%
number of circuit courts um
 
00:13:03.509 --> 00:13:03.519 align:start position:0%
so right now i'd say that i am probably
 
00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
right around
 
00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:07.680 align:start position:0%
between 50 and 60 court officers
 
00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:10.000 align:start position:0%
now not all of them are able to work
 
00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
five days a week so we have to mix and
 
00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:14.800 align:start position:0%
match so it's it's um i'm not able to
 
00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:16.240 align:start position:0%
give you a concrete answer it's kind of
 
00:13:18.389 --> 00:13:18.399 align:start position:0%
a moving target frankly uh and we'll
 
00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:20.800 align:start position:0%
have additional folks that come in if we
 
00:13:23.190 --> 00:13:23.200 align:start position:0%
have a long duration trial a jury trial
 
00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:24.880 align:start position:0%
or things like that sometimes we have to
 
00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
ramp up um
 
00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:30.160 align:start position:0%
but uh ideally uh i mean i would love to
 
00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:32.560 align:start position:0%
have an additional 20 or so to choose
 
00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
from in that in that pool so we'd be
 
00:13:38.629 --> 00:13:38.639 align:start position:0%
able to to ramp up and adequately staff
 
00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
you're welcome thank you
 
00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:46.550 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:47.670 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:47.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:13:50.629 --> 00:13:50.639 align:start position:0%
do these people on a per diem basis
 
00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:52.160 align:start position:0%
perform many of the
 
00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:53.920 align:start position:0%
many of the functions that the other
 
00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:56.480 align:start position:0%
court officers do other than just
 
00:13:59.910 --> 00:13:59.920 align:start position:0%
transport people around or so um again
 
00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:02.320 align:start position:0%
speaking for hillsborough county all the
 
00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:04.480 align:start position:0%
court officers that i have are
 
00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:06.880 align:start position:0%
cross-trained so they're able to provide
 
00:14:09.269 --> 00:14:09.279 align:start position:0%
functions both for instance in the cell
 
00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:12.160 align:start position:0%
block uh and or running the magnetometer
 
00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:14.320 align:start position:0%
at the front door so all those folks are
 
00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
able to to fit into a position depending
 
00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:18.240 align:start position:0%
on where the need is for that particular
 
00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:20.560 align:start position:0%
day follow-up follow-up
 
00:14:22.069 --> 00:14:22.079 align:start position:0%
whether they're per diem or not i'm just
 
00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:23.120 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out if there's a
 
00:14:25.189 --> 00:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
difference between people oh i'm sorry i
 
00:14:27.829 --> 00:14:27.839 align:start position:0%
misunderstood they they're all per damn
 
00:14:29.269 --> 00:14:29.279 align:start position:0%
they're all per diem they're all the
 
00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:30.800 align:start position:0%
team that we see are pediatrics that's
 
00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:32.480 align:start position:0%
correct some get a higher rate than
 
00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:34.480 align:start position:0%
others it depends on the county some of
 
00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:36.320 align:start position:0%
the counties are paying a higher rate
 
00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:38.160 align:start position:0%
than different counties so it really
 
00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
depends all the court officers that you
 
00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
would see for instance if you went into
 
00:14:44.310 --> 00:14:44.320 align:start position:0%
the hillsborough superior court are
 
00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:45.920 align:start position:0%
being paid the same whether you're at
 
00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:48.480 align:start position:0%
the north or south courthouse or any of
 
00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:50.800 align:start position:0%
our circuit courts in the county
 
00:14:53.189 --> 00:14:53.199 align:start position:0%
one more follow-up
 
00:14:53.199 --> 00:14:54.389 align:start position:0%
one more follow-up
even

00:14:54.389 --> 00:14:54.399 align:start position:0%
even
 
00:14:57.430 --> 00:14:57.440 align:start position:0%
so they are all there are they are
 
00:14:59.110 --> 00:14:59.120 align:start position:0%
i thought i when i heard your previous
 
00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
testimony i thought you said
 
00:15:03.430 --> 00:15:03.440 align:start position:0%
are they all per diem that's correct
 
00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:04.720 align:start position:0%
they're all predicting them okay thank
 
00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:10.389 --> 00:15:10.399 align:start position:0%

00:16:56.870 --> 00:16:56.880 align:start position:0%

representative welch you wish to be
 
00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:07.669 --> 00:20:07.679 align:start position:0%
yes i i would recommend an octopass with
 
00:20:13.909 --> 00:20:13.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
i'm going to
 
00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
give respect to the dean and
 
00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:19.120 align:start position:0%
acknowledge representative pantelock
 
00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:25.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:26.400 align:start position:0%
representative welch do you wish to
 
00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:29.440 align:start position:0%
speak to speak to the motion
 
00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:30.390 align:start position:0%
speak to speak to the motion
uh

00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:30.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:32.640 align:start position:0%
this bill actually immense language that
 
00:20:34.870 --> 00:20:34.880 align:start position:0%
we put on several years back
 
00:20:37.029 --> 00:20:37.039 align:start position:0%
it was a three-year fight with a
 
00:20:38.789 --> 00:20:38.799 align:start position:0%
judicial branch
 
00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:41.200 align:start position:0%
to get them any money at all because up
 
00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:43.440 align:start position:0%
until then it was a county
 
00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:46.480 align:start position:0%
responsibility to pay
 
00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:48.400 align:start position:0%
these folks
 
00:20:50.789 --> 00:20:50.799 align:start position:0%
and one of the reasons that we
 
00:20:50.799 --> 00:20:53.750 align:start position:0%
and one of the reasons that we
negotiated

00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:56.149 --> 00:20:56.159 align:start position:0%
we got it in all the courts except the
 
00:20:58.310 --> 00:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
supreme court and i think if you look at
 
00:21:00.149 --> 00:21:00.159 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:21:02.149 --> 00:21:02.159 align:start position:0%
at the statutes you'll see that they
 
00:21:02.159 --> 00:21:02.870 align:start position:0%
at the statutes you'll see that they
have

00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:06.320 align:start position:0%
supreme court security officers
 
00:21:09.029 --> 00:21:09.039 align:start position:0%
this puts them on a power
 
00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:10.960 align:start position:0%
i think it's long overdue we would have
 
00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:13.520 align:start position:0%
done it back then but it was a big fight
 
00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
actually it actually cause the
 
00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:17.600 align:start position:0%
impeachment of the chiefs to stay with
 
00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:18.950 align:start position:0%
impeachment of the chiefs to stay with
brock

00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
brock
 
00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:20.549 align:start position:0%
brock
and

00:21:20.549 --> 00:21:20.559 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
i think
 
00:21:24.070 --> 00:21:24.080 align:start position:0%
passing this will just make everything
 
00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:37.990 align:start position:0%
passing this will just make everything
equal

00:21:37.990 --> 00:21:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:41.029 --> 00:21:41.039 align:start position:0%
so i'm like 100 supportive of this and
 
00:21:44.149 --> 00:21:44.159 align:start position:0%
would you know probably ought to pass um
 
00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:46.240 align:start position:0%
my only question i have is that there is
 
00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:46.950 align:start position:0%
my only question i have is that there is
just

00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:46.960 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:50.080 align:start position:0%
i think the front uh my friend from
 
00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
from portsmouth uh representative
 
00:21:53.029 --> 00:21:53.039 align:start position:0%
pencillock was raised was just a
 
00:21:56.070 --> 00:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
question about the the methodology on
 
00:21:59.029 --> 00:21:59.039 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note on talking about the
 
00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:04.070 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:06.480 align:start position:0%
and i just did it a little weird
 
00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:12.149 --> 00:22:12.159 align:start position:0%
it might have been left behind from
 
00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:13.840 align:start position:0%
another amendment
 
00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:14.710 align:start position:0%
another amendment
what

00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:14.720 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:16.720 align:start position:0%
what's the exact question i mean it's
 
00:22:18.230 --> 00:22:18.240 align:start position:0%
not well it's not a question we're we're
 
00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:20.480 align:start position:0%
an exec so um but my well my but my
 
00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:22.240 align:start position:0%
issue is i just i don't know how what
 
00:22:25.110 --> 00:22:25.120 align:start position:0%
that has to do with with sheriff
 
00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:33.190 --> 00:22:33.200 align:start position:0%
representative welch you want to give
 
00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:37.830 --> 00:22:37.840 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure how this bill was before it
 
00:22:40.870 --> 00:22:40.880 align:start position:0%
was amended to the senate but clearly it
 
00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:42.880 align:start position:0%
has nothing to do with state police
 
00:22:45.990 --> 00:22:46.000 align:start position:0%
right that's the question that that's
 
00:22:47.669 --> 00:22:47.679 align:start position:0%
fiscal note was probably written on the
 
00:22:50.710 --> 00:22:50.720 align:start position:0%
original bill yeah and then it was taken
 
00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:51.510 align:start position:0%
original bill yeah and then it was taken
out

00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:51.520 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:52.960 align:start position:0%
i mean it's fine with me i'm going to
 
00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:02.310 --> 00:23:02.320 align:start position:0%
although this isn't a hearing where
 
00:23:04.149 --> 00:23:04.159 align:start position:0%
where we would receive any input from
 
00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:08.080 align:start position:0%
the public i do see some
 
00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
sheriffs if if we're saying anything
 
00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:12.880 align:start position:0%
that's not that's if that's not
 
00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:14.240 align:start position:0%
consistent with the intent of the bill
 
00:23:19.350 --> 00:23:19.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
representative burt
 
00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:23:25.909 --> 00:23:25.919 align:start position:0%
if i understood correctly the answer
 
00:23:28.710 --> 00:23:28.720 align:start position:0%
from the officer
 
00:23:30.149 --> 00:23:30.159 align:start position:0%
you know the money is going to come from
 
00:23:31.350 --> 00:23:31.360 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:33.360 align:start position:0%
which i believe really should come from
 
00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:34.960 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:36.480 align:start position:0%
and right now some of it's coming from
 
00:23:38.549 --> 00:23:38.559 align:start position:0%
the county
 
00:23:40.149 --> 00:23:40.159 align:start position:0%
i mean even though it's all the same
 
00:23:41.669 --> 00:23:41.679 align:start position:0%
money i mean it's coming out of the left
 
00:23:43.510 --> 00:23:43.520 align:start position:0%
pocket or the right pocket but you know
 
00:23:45.190 --> 00:23:45.200 align:start position:0%
bottom line it should come from the
 
00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:49.029 align:start position:0%
bottom line it should come from the
state

00:23:49.029 --> 00:23:49.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:50.390 --> 00:23:50.400 align:start position:0%
oh it does now
 
00:23:52.549 --> 00:23:52.559 align:start position:0%
okay all right yeah that's where i was
 
00:23:55.270 --> 00:23:55.280 align:start position:0%
confused was if if
 
00:23:57.430 --> 00:23:57.440 align:start position:0%
you know if the county is paying for
 
00:23:59.029 --> 00:23:59.039 align:start position:0%
some of this now
 
00:23:59.039 --> 00:24:00.070 align:start position:0%
some of this now
and

00:24:00.070 --> 00:24:00.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:01.430 align:start position:0%
and
yeah

00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:01.440 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:24:02.870 --> 00:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
you know the county's losing money on
 
00:24:04.630 --> 00:24:04.640 align:start position:0%
this presley yeah so clean up the
 
00:24:07.029 --> 00:24:07.039 align:start position:0%
language thank you mr chairman
 
00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:09.200 align:start position:0%
representative newman
 
00:24:11.669 --> 00:24:11.679 align:start position:0%
yeah just a parliamentary inquiry i i'm
 
00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:13.440 align:start position:0%
reading the language about the fiscal
 
00:24:15.990 --> 00:24:16.000 align:start position:0%
note if the fiscal note has an error in
 
00:24:17.669 --> 00:24:17.679 align:start position:0%
it or or it doesn't make sense it
 
00:24:19.029 --> 00:24:19.039 align:start position:0%
doesn't really have an effect on the
 
00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:23.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:25.120 align:start position:0%
it does not what becomes law is not the
 
00:24:27.190 --> 00:24:27.200 align:start position:0%
fiscal note but becomes large is the
 
00:24:29.190 --> 00:24:29.200 align:start position:0%
balance thank you and typically the
 
00:24:31.590 --> 00:24:31.600 align:start position:0%
fiscal note isn't amended with
 
00:24:33.430 --> 00:24:33.440 align:start position:0%
a bill amendment well if you attach it
 
00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:35.600 align:start position:0%
so if you attach it to the bill then it
 
00:24:37.510 --> 00:24:37.520 align:start position:0%
has an effect
 
00:24:40.470 --> 00:24:40.480 align:start position:0%
but you won't you don't
 
00:24:42.630 --> 00:24:42.640 align:start position:0%
not exactly what becomes law is the
 
00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:45.360 align:start position:0%
actual bill the fiscal note really
 
00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
offers maybe some input on the
 
00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:49.760 align:start position:0%
well the financial the fiscal impact of
 
00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
what what the bill would thank you if it
 
00:24:53.029 --> 00:24:53.039 align:start position:0%
became law
 
00:24:55.830 --> 00:24:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:57.350 --> 00:24:57.360 align:start position:0%

nami new hampshire
 
00:52:45.510 --> 00:52:45.520 align:start position:0%
is strongly in support
 
00:52:46.950 --> 00:52:46.960 align:start position:0%
of senate bill
 
00:52:46.960 --> 00:52:48.470 align:start position:0%
of senate bill
376

00:52:48.470 --> 00:52:48.480 align:start position:0%
376
 
00:52:51.270 --> 00:52:51.280 align:start position:0%
which as you just heard would create
 
00:52:53.750 --> 00:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
a study committee to look at putting
 
00:52:56.069 --> 00:52:56.079 align:start position:0%
together a review board
 
00:52:57.750 --> 00:52:57.760 align:start position:0%
for incidents
 
00:52:59.430 --> 00:52:59.440 align:start position:0%
where there's an officer involved
 
00:53:01.990 --> 00:53:02.000 align:start position:0%
shooting and it would also provide some
 
00:53:06.309 --> 00:53:06.319 align:start position:0%
additional funding for cit training
 
00:53:08.870 --> 00:53:08.880 align:start position:0%
based on an analysis done by the concord
 
00:53:11.430 --> 00:53:11.440 align:start position:0%
monitor in new hampshire
 
00:53:14.230 --> 00:53:14.240 align:start position:0%
more than 60 percent of the people shot
 
00:53:16.870 --> 00:53:16.880 align:start position:0%
and killed by police
 
00:53:19.030 --> 00:53:19.040 align:start position:0%
in the last decade had a mental health
 
00:53:19.040 --> 00:53:21.349 align:start position:0%
in the last decade had a mental health
issue

00:53:21.349 --> 00:53:21.359 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:53:24.230 --> 00:53:24.240 align:start position:0%
right now there is no federal or state
 
00:53:27.349 --> 00:53:27.359 align:start position:0%
agency that collects data on the role
 
00:53:29.430 --> 00:53:29.440 align:start position:0%
that mental illness plays
 
00:53:32.390 --> 00:53:32.400 align:start position:0%
in these incidents
 
00:53:35.430 --> 00:53:35.440 align:start position:0%
but in looking at
 
00:53:37.430 --> 00:53:37.440 align:start position:0%
data that's been compiled across the
 
00:53:38.790 --> 00:53:38.800 align:start position:0%
country by
 
00:53:41.750 --> 00:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
certain news agencies
 
00:53:44.069 --> 00:53:44.079 align:start position:0%
when you compare it to new hampshire new
 
00:53:45.910 --> 00:53:45.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire has a higher
 
00:53:45.920 --> 00:53:47.270 align:start position:0%
hampshire has a higher
incidence

00:53:47.270 --> 00:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
incidence
 
00:53:47.280 --> 00:53:48.870 align:start position:0%
incidence
of

00:53:48.870 --> 00:53:48.880 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:53:50.549 --> 00:53:50.559 align:start position:0%
folks that have mental illness that are
 
00:53:51.990 --> 00:53:52.000 align:start position:0%
involved in these
 
00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:53.109 align:start position:0%
involved in these
incidents

00:53:53.109 --> 00:53:53.119 align:start position:0%
incidents
 
00:53:55.190 --> 00:53:55.200 align:start position:0%
and i do believe higher incidents in
 
00:53:59.190 --> 00:53:59.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:01.109 --> 00:54:01.119 align:start position:0%
having a review board to look at these
 
00:54:01.119 --> 00:54:02.309 align:start position:0%
having a review board to look at these
incidents

00:54:02.309 --> 00:54:02.319 align:start position:0%
incidents
 
00:54:04.549 --> 00:54:04.559 align:start position:0%
is paramount in assessing
 
00:54:06.790 --> 00:54:06.800 align:start position:0%
whether different interventions could be
 
00:54:11.670 --> 00:54:11.680 align:start position:0%
used to achieve a different outcome
 
00:54:14.150 --> 00:54:14.160 align:start position:0%
the review board could assess the timing
 
00:54:15.750 --> 00:54:15.760 align:start position:0%
of interventions
 
00:54:18.069 --> 00:54:18.079 align:start position:0%
and what training is needed
 
00:54:19.750 --> 00:54:19.760 align:start position:0%
to execute these
 
00:54:22.829 --> 00:54:22.839 align:start position:0%
interventions to achieve positive
 
00:54:25.910 --> 00:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
outcomes and so the study committee
 
00:54:29.589 --> 00:54:29.599 align:start position:0%
that's created by senate bill 376 would
 
00:54:31.510 --> 00:54:31.520 align:start position:0%
be able to gather information from all
 
00:54:34.069 --> 00:54:34.079 align:start position:0%
the key stakeholders to recommend
 
00:54:35.990 --> 00:54:36.000 align:start position:0%
what the review board should look like
 
00:54:38.630 --> 00:54:38.640 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
00:54:38.640 --> 00:54:39.750 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
secondly

00:54:39.750 --> 00:54:39.760 align:start position:0%
secondly
 
00:54:43.349 --> 00:54:43.359 align:start position:0%
this bill appropriates some funds for
 
00:54:43.359 --> 00:54:44.790 align:start position:0%
this bill appropriates some funds for
cit

00:54:44.790 --> 00:54:44.800 align:start position:0%
cit
 
00:54:46.710 --> 00:54:46.720 align:start position:0%
training for
 
00:54:48.390 --> 00:54:48.400 align:start position:0%
specifically for
 
00:54:50.470 --> 00:54:50.480 align:start position:0%
the smaller departments
 
00:54:54.630 --> 00:54:54.640 align:start position:0%
and for the more rural departments
 
00:54:58.870 --> 00:54:58.880 align:start position:0%
it appropriates funds that can be used
 
00:55:00.710 --> 00:55:00.720 align:start position:0%
for the overtime backfilling for the
 
00:55:00.720 --> 00:55:02.309 align:start position:0%
for the overtime backfilling for the
overtime

00:55:02.309 --> 00:55:02.319 align:start position:0%
overtime
 
00:55:04.790 --> 00:55:04.800 align:start position:0%
as well as travel and
 
00:55:04.800 --> 00:55:05.589 align:start position:0%
as well as travel and
and

00:55:05.589 --> 00:55:05.599 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:55:08.549 --> 00:55:08.559 align:start position:0%
meal expenses
 
00:55:08.559 --> 00:55:10.790 align:start position:0%
meal expenses
um

00:55:10.790 --> 00:55:10.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:13.270 --> 00:55:13.280 align:start position:0%
and we we strongly uh support this
 
00:55:15.030 --> 00:55:15.040 align:start position:0%
aspect of the bill as well but we would
 
00:55:17.750 --> 00:55:17.760 align:start position:0%
suggest one minor amendment and i do
 
00:55:17.760 --> 00:55:18.630 align:start position:0%
suggest one minor amendment and i do
have

00:55:18.630 --> 00:55:18.640 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:55:21.349 --> 00:55:21.359 align:start position:0%
copies of some suggested language if the
 
00:55:22.870 --> 00:55:22.880 align:start position:0%
if the
 
00:55:25.030 --> 00:55:25.040 align:start position:0%
committee would like to look at that
 
00:55:26.150 --> 00:55:26.160 align:start position:0%
which would
 
00:55:30.710 --> 00:55:30.720 align:start position:0%
just add um into the language
 
00:55:30.720 --> 00:55:33.270 align:start position:0%
just add um into the language
um

00:55:33.270 --> 00:55:33.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:37.309 --> 00:55:37.319 align:start position:0%
that this money could also be used for
 
00:55:40.390 --> 00:55:40.400 align:start position:0%
facilitation and instruction
 
00:55:44.150 --> 00:55:44.160 align:start position:0%
of additional training sessions
 
00:55:47.750 --> 00:55:47.760 align:start position:0%
uh as it is right now the appropriation
 
00:55:47.760 --> 00:55:48.710 align:start position:0%
uh as it is right now the appropriation
is

00:55:48.710 --> 00:55:48.720 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:55:51.829 --> 00:55:51.839 align:start position:0%
only to be used for the back filling
 
00:55:53.109 --> 00:55:53.119 align:start position:0%
and for
 
00:55:55.750 --> 00:55:55.760 align:start position:0%
meals and travel but there's but it
 
00:55:57.750 --> 00:55:57.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't i think
 
00:56:01.510 --> 00:56:01.520 align:start position:0%
they left out um additional funds for
 
00:56:04.950 --> 00:56:04.960 align:start position:0%
the the cost of the training itself so
 
00:56:06.549 --> 00:56:06.559 align:start position:0%
we have some suggested language that
 
00:56:08.630 --> 00:56:08.640 align:start position:0%
would just put that back in and as i
 
00:56:10.630 --> 00:56:10.640 align:start position:0%
said i don't know if the committee would
 
00:56:10.640 --> 00:56:11.670 align:start position:0%
said i don't know if the committee would
like

00:56:11.670 --> 00:56:11.680 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:56:13.829 --> 00:56:13.839 align:start position:0%
a copy of
 
00:56:17.109 --> 00:56:17.119 align:start position:0%
what we've suggested
 
00:56:19.030 --> 00:56:19.040 align:start position:0%
you may you may pass up any materials
 
00:56:49.030 --> 00:56:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:50.630 --> 00:56:50.640 align:start position:0%
so in wrapping up i know there's some
 
00:56:52.950 --> 00:56:52.960 align:start position:0%
folks that that have a lot
 
00:56:54.710 --> 00:56:54.720 align:start position:0%
more personal
 
00:56:56.950 --> 00:56:56.960 align:start position:0%
intimate knowledge about this bill
 
00:56:58.950 --> 00:56:58.960 align:start position:0%
so i will leave it there
 
00:57:01.270 --> 00:57:01.280 align:start position:0%
and just say that we
 
00:57:05.510 --> 00:57:05.520 align:start position:0%
urge the committee to vote ought to pass
 
00:57:08.069 --> 00:57:08.079 align:start position:0%
and consider the amendment that
 
00:57:08.079 --> 00:57:08.950 align:start position:0%
and consider the amendment that
we

00:57:08.950 --> 00:57:08.960 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:57:08.960 --> 00:57:10.630 align:start position:0%
we
suggested

00:57:10.630 --> 00:57:10.640 align:start position:0%
suggested
 
00:57:24.789 --> 00:57:24.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:28.069 --> 00:57:28.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:29.990 --> 00:57:30.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
00:57:32.630 --> 00:57:32.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
00:57:35.829 --> 00:57:35.839 align:start position:0%
you want this board to be set up
 
00:57:38.150 --> 00:57:38.160 align:start position:0%
inside of the police standard and
 
00:57:38.160 --> 00:57:39.109 align:start position:0%
inside of the police standard and
training

00:57:39.109 --> 00:57:39.119 align:start position:0%
training
 
00:57:40.870 --> 00:57:40.880 align:start position:0%
is that correct
 
00:57:42.630 --> 00:57:42.640 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for the question this
 
00:57:44.150 --> 00:57:44.160 align:start position:0%
isn't something that
 
00:57:46.950 --> 00:57:46.960 align:start position:0%
nami new hampshire wants the programs
 
00:57:50.470 --> 00:57:50.480 align:start position:0%
the pro the cit program itself right now
 
00:57:52.309 --> 00:57:52.319 align:start position:0%
that is existing
 
00:57:55.030 --> 00:57:55.040 align:start position:0%
is set up through the police standards
 
00:57:57.190 --> 00:57:57.200 align:start position:0%
and training they get the funding and
 
00:57:59.910 --> 00:57:59.920 align:start position:0%
then they contract out to the vendors to
 
00:58:01.910 --> 00:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
provide the training
 
00:58:04.150 --> 00:58:04.160 align:start position:0%
just so happens that nami new hampshire
 
00:58:06.470 --> 00:58:06.480 align:start position:0%
is the vendor currently that provides
 
00:58:07.750 --> 00:58:07.760 align:start position:0%
that training
 
00:58:07.760 --> 00:58:11.030 align:start position:0%
that training
so

00:58:11.030 --> 00:58:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:13.750 --> 00:58:13.760 align:start position:0%
we just want the the program to
 
00:58:17.109 --> 00:58:17.119 align:start position:0%
expand and continue um
 
00:58:20.069 --> 00:58:20.079 align:start position:0%
we're not the entity that is behind
 
00:58:22.470 --> 00:58:22.480 align:start position:0%
where that money goes i think direct
 
00:58:24.870 --> 00:58:24.880 align:start position:0%
commissioner skipper director skipper
 
00:58:27.750 --> 00:58:27.760 align:start position:0%
director skipper is here um that can
 
00:58:30.230 --> 00:58:30.240 align:start position:0%
they answer any questions about um you
 
00:58:31.829 --> 00:58:31.839 align:start position:0%
know why the funding goes through to
 
00:58:42.069 --> 00:58:42.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:42.079 --> 00:58:43.990 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:58:43.990 --> 00:58:44.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:58:45.910 --> 00:58:45.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman if i understood
 
00:58:48.549 --> 00:58:48.559 align:start position:0%
you correctly you said that the
 
00:58:50.870 --> 00:58:50.880 align:start position:0%
cit program was
 
00:58:52.950 --> 00:58:52.960 align:start position:0%
uh in your view
 
00:58:55.670 --> 00:58:55.680 align:start position:0%
primarily for rural and smaller towns
 
00:58:56.710 --> 00:58:56.720 align:start position:0%
could you
 
00:59:00.150 --> 00:59:00.160 align:start position:0%
both explain why that is and how that
 
00:59:01.670 --> 00:59:01.680 align:start position:0%
would work within the context of the
 
00:59:06.230 --> 00:59:06.240 align:start position:0%
spill yeah uh so the cit which is the
 
00:59:09.190 --> 00:59:09.200 align:start position:0%
uh crisis uh intervention crisis
 
00:59:11.190 --> 00:59:11.200 align:start position:0%
intervention team training
 
00:59:11.200 --> 00:59:12.470 align:start position:0%
intervention team training
um

00:59:12.470 --> 00:59:12.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:12.480 --> 00:59:13.510 align:start position:0%
um
isn't

00:59:13.510 --> 00:59:13.520 align:start position:0%
isn't
 
00:59:16.069 --> 00:59:16.079 align:start position:0%
just for rural and small
 
00:59:18.309 --> 00:59:18.319 align:start position:0%
it's for any police officer any first
 
00:59:21.109 --> 00:59:21.119 align:start position:0%
responder actually there's a lot of
 
00:59:22.870 --> 00:59:22.880 align:start position:0%
fire and ems that go through this as
 
00:59:22.880 --> 00:59:24.069 align:start position:0%
fire and ems that go through this as
well

00:59:24.069 --> 00:59:24.079 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:59:25.829 --> 00:59:25.839 align:start position:0%
the the
 
00:59:28.950 --> 00:59:28.960 align:start position:0%
what we found though is that for the
 
00:59:28.960 --> 00:59:32.230 align:start position:0%
what we found though is that for the
smaller

00:59:32.230 --> 00:59:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:33.910 --> 00:59:33.920 align:start position:0%
departments and the departments that are
 
00:59:35.670 --> 00:59:35.680 align:start position:0%
more rural
 
00:59:37.750 --> 00:59:37.760 align:start position:0%
they don't have enough personnel to be
 
00:59:39.910 --> 00:59:39.920 align:start position:0%
able to send somebody to a 40 hour a
 
00:59:42.150 --> 00:59:42.160 align:start position:0%
week course
 
00:59:44.870 --> 00:59:44.880 align:start position:0%
so in order to be able to make this
 
00:59:47.430 --> 00:59:47.440 align:start position:0%
available to them as well
 
00:59:48.870 --> 00:59:48.880 align:start position:0%
this funding
 
00:59:51.589 --> 00:59:51.599 align:start position:0%
will help those departments backfill
 
00:59:54.710 --> 00:59:54.720 align:start position:0%
and get personnel in to cover
 
00:59:58.309 --> 00:59:58.319 align:start position:0%
when that officer is gone for that week
 
01:00:00.390 --> 01:00:00.400 align:start position:0%
because otherwise they wouldn't be able
 
01:00:02.390 --> 01:00:02.400 align:start position:0%
to participate and it would only be open
 
01:00:04.630 --> 01:00:04.640 align:start position:0%
to the bigger departments and the state
 
01:00:07.270 --> 01:00:07.280 align:start position:0%
police that have ample
 
01:00:09.510 --> 01:00:09.520 align:start position:0%
staff to be able to uh
 
01:00:18.470 --> 01:00:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:21.030 --> 01:00:21.040 align:start position:0%
representative marston
 
01:00:22.630 --> 01:00:22.640 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:00:26.549 --> 01:00:26.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:28.950 --> 01:00:28.960 align:start position:0%
i have a question in regards to mental
 
01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:31.270 align:start position:0%
i have a question in regards to mental
health

01:00:31.270 --> 01:00:31.280 align:start position:0%
health
 
01:00:34.630 --> 01:00:34.640 align:start position:0%
why or is there is the mental health
 
01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:35.829 align:start position:0%
why or is there is the mental health
of

01:00:35.829 --> 01:00:35.839 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:00:37.750 --> 01:00:37.760 align:start position:0%
people doing more to help people with
 
01:00:39.910 --> 01:00:39.920 align:start position:0%
these kinds of problems because what i'm
 
01:00:42.710 --> 01:00:42.720 align:start position:0%
hearing you say in this bill is that we
 
01:00:45.430 --> 01:00:45.440 align:start position:0%
want the state through the police to do
 
01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:46.549 align:start position:0%
want the state through the police to do
something

01:00:46.549 --> 01:00:46.559 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:00:48.950 --> 01:00:48.960 align:start position:0%
and that's fine and dandy
 
01:00:51.349 --> 01:00:51.359 align:start position:0%
but i'm also looking at
 
01:00:53.510 --> 01:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
what is mental health people we have a
 
01:00:55.670 --> 01:00:55.680 align:start position:0%
mental health in manchester and
 
01:00:56.390 --> 01:00:56.400 align:start position:0%
are they
 
01:00:58.870 --> 01:00:58.880 align:start position:0%
doing things and families have to go to
 
01:01:00.470 --> 01:01:00.480 align:start position:0%
them first because i would think they
 
01:01:02.950 --> 01:01:02.960 align:start position:0%
don't go to the police looking for help
 
01:01:06.390 --> 01:01:06.400 align:start position:0%
because i think that's the issue is
 
01:01:09.349 --> 01:01:09.359 align:start position:0%
we have them on the streets all over
 
01:01:12.069 --> 01:01:12.079 align:start position:0%
and it becomes a problem and then all of
 
01:01:13.750 --> 01:01:13.760 align:start position:0%
a sudden an issue comes up with the
 
01:01:16.069 --> 01:01:16.079 align:start position:0%
police are involved and they don't know
 
01:01:17.670 --> 01:01:17.680 align:start position:0%
how to handle it but
 
01:01:19.990 --> 01:01:20.000 align:start position:0%
how do we handle the mental health issue
 
01:01:22.549 --> 01:01:22.559 align:start position:0%
prior to the police getting involved
 
01:01:25.750 --> 01:01:25.760 align:start position:0%
and thank you for the question um
 
01:01:29.270 --> 01:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
the state uh just recently on january 1
 
01:01:31.190 --> 01:01:31.200 align:start position:0%
of this year
 
01:01:33.990 --> 01:01:34.000 align:start position:0%
we had enacted statewide
 
01:01:36.950 --> 01:01:36.960 align:start position:0%
mobile crisis response within the state
 
01:01:38.549 --> 01:01:38.559 align:start position:0%
and there's a centralized number that
 
01:01:40.390 --> 01:01:40.400 align:start position:0%
anybody can call for a mental health
 
01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:41.589 align:start position:0%
anybody can call for a mental health
crisis

01:01:41.589 --> 01:01:41.599 align:start position:0%
crisis
 
01:01:44.309 --> 01:01:44.319 align:start position:0%
so that is also another system that's
 
01:01:47.190 --> 01:01:47.200 align:start position:0%
working in parallel with this so that
 
01:01:49.829 --> 01:01:49.839 align:start position:0%
um there is another option other than
 
01:01:51.109 --> 01:01:51.119 align:start position:0%
just calling
 
01:01:53.510 --> 01:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
and having the police show up
 
01:01:56.150 --> 01:01:56.160 align:start position:0%
that being said there are still going to
 
01:01:56.160 --> 01:01:56.870 align:start position:0%
that being said there are still going to
be

01:01:56.870 --> 01:01:56.880 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:01:56.880 --> 01:01:58.230 align:start position:0%
be
those

01:01:58.230 --> 01:01:58.240 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:02:01.109 --> 01:02:01.119 align:start position:0%
times when the police are called or are
 
01:02:02.549 --> 01:02:02.559 align:start position:0%
are needed
 
01:02:06.069 --> 01:02:06.079 align:start position:0%
and when those times happen
 
01:02:08.309 --> 01:02:08.319 align:start position:0%
it's best to have an officer who's been
 
01:02:09.829 --> 01:02:09.839 align:start position:0%
through this training
 
01:02:15.829 --> 01:02:15.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:20.630 --> 01:02:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:21.990 --> 01:02:22.000 align:start position:0%
representative marston you recognize for
 
01:02:23.589 --> 01:02:23.599 align:start position:0%
a follow-up
 
01:02:25.670 --> 01:02:25.680 align:start position:0%
can you tell us where we would find like
 
01:02:27.910 --> 01:02:27.920 align:start position:0%
a number to reach these people that do
 
01:02:29.910 --> 01:02:29.920 align:start position:0%
this kind of intervention
 
01:02:34.470 --> 01:02:34.480 align:start position:0%
the mobile public side by the state
 
01:02:37.990 --> 01:02:38.000 align:start position:0%
there is a i don't have the 800 number
 
01:02:39.510 --> 01:02:39.520 align:start position:0%
with me right now but i can certainly
 
01:02:41.750 --> 01:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
get it to you and as of
 
01:02:45.430 --> 01:02:45.440 align:start position:0%
i think it's july 15th or 16th um
 
01:02:47.109 --> 01:02:47.119 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a
 
01:02:47.119 --> 01:02:48.549 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a
nationwide

01:02:48.549 --> 01:02:48.559 align:start position:0%
nationwide
 
01:02:50.309 --> 01:02:50.319 align:start position:0%
mental health crisis number that's going
 
01:02:53.349 --> 01:02:53.359 align:start position:0%
to go into effect that's 988 but that's
 
01:02:55.670 --> 01:02:55.680 align:start position:0%
not going into effect until july
 
01:02:58.150 --> 01:02:58.160 align:start position:0%
until then we've got the the 1 800
 
01:02:58.160 --> 01:02:59.349 align:start position:0%
until then we've got the the 1 800
number

01:02:59.349 --> 01:02:59.359 align:start position:0%
number
 
01:03:01.109 --> 01:03:01.119 align:start position:0%
that will still remain live even after
 
01:03:02.870 --> 01:03:02.880 align:start position:0%
the 988 so i can get that for you
 
01:03:09.750 --> 01:03:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:11.109 --> 01:03:11.119 align:start position:0%
see no hands raised i want to thank the

before you today and i thank senator

gaida and the other sponsors of this
 
01:05:09.029 --> 01:05:09.039 align:start position:0%
bill the interest in this bill um
 
01:05:11.190 --> 01:05:11.200 align:start position:0%
is several-fold and it includes
 
01:05:13.109 --> 01:05:13.119 align:start position:0%
as holly stevens stated the high number
 
01:05:14.470 --> 01:05:14.480 align:start position:0%
of people with mental illness who are
 
01:05:16.309 --> 01:05:16.319 align:start position:0%
victims of officer-involved shootings in
 
01:05:17.510 --> 01:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
01:05:19.750 --> 01:05:19.760 align:start position:0%
and how training and policies could be
 
01:05:21.430 --> 01:05:21.440 align:start position:0%
improved to reduce the incidence of
 
01:05:23.349 --> 01:05:23.359 align:start position:0%
those shootings and then the mental
 
01:05:25.349 --> 01:05:25.359 align:start position:0%
health impacts on the families of people
 
01:05:26.710 --> 01:05:26.720 align:start position:0%
who are killed or injured in an
 
01:05:28.870 --> 01:05:28.880 align:start position:0%
officer-involved shooting as well as the
 
01:05:30.870 --> 01:05:30.880 align:start position:0%
mental health impacts on the officers
 
01:05:34.390 --> 01:05:34.400 align:start position:0%
themselves and on their families
 
01:05:36.630 --> 01:05:36.640 align:start position:0%
the bill is two parts as she explained
 
01:05:38.390 --> 01:05:38.400 align:start position:0%
there's the crisis intervention team
 
01:05:42.069 --> 01:05:42.079 align:start position:0%
training component of it and uh cit as
 
01:05:43.829 --> 01:05:43.839 align:start position:0%
it's called is considered the gold
 
01:05:46.549 --> 01:05:46.559 align:start position:0%
standard for law enforcement and first
 
01:05:48.710 --> 01:05:48.720 align:start position:0%
responders relative to training about
 
01:05:50.950 --> 01:05:50.960 align:start position:0%
mental illness and de-escalation of a
 
01:05:50.960 --> 01:05:52.069 align:start position:0%
mental illness and de-escalation of a
crisis

01:05:52.069 --> 01:05:52.079 align:start position:0%
crisis
 
01:05:54.950 --> 01:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
and the 2015
 
01:05:57.430 --> 01:05:57.440 align:start position:0%
president's task force force on 21st
 
01:05:59.270 --> 01:05:59.280 align:start position:0%
century policing
 
01:06:00.950 --> 01:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
recommended that every
 
01:06:02.789 --> 01:06:02.799 align:start position:0%
law enforcement officer receive the
 
01:06:05.430 --> 01:06:05.440 align:start position:0%
40-hour crisis intervention team
 
01:06:08.549 --> 01:06:08.559 align:start position:0%
training and there is some as holly
 
01:06:10.630 --> 01:06:10.640 align:start position:0%
mentioned some current cit training
 
01:06:13.029 --> 01:06:13.039 align:start position:0%
occurring in the state of new hampshire
 
01:06:13.039 --> 01:06:14.069 align:start position:0%
occurring in the state of new hampshire
by

01:06:14.069 --> 01:06:14.079 align:start position:0%
by
 
01:06:16.390 --> 01:06:16.400 align:start position:0%
nami new hampshire together with police
 
01:06:17.990 --> 01:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
standards and training and also a
 
01:06:20.630 --> 01:06:20.640 align:start position:0%
component of it under a federal grant
 
01:06:22.630 --> 01:06:22.640 align:start position:0%
but as holly testified the biggest
 
01:06:25.190 --> 01:06:25.200 align:start position:0%
barrier to
 
01:06:27.029 --> 01:06:27.039 align:start position:0%
to getting people to the training
 
01:06:29.109 --> 01:06:29.119 align:start position:0%
particularly for the smaller communities
 
01:06:31.349 --> 01:06:31.359 align:start position:0%
is the cost of sending an officer for 40
 
01:06:33.829 --> 01:06:33.839 align:start position:0%
hours and then having to backfill
 
01:06:36.950 --> 01:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
either with overtime or to pay
 
01:06:38.710 --> 01:06:38.720 align:start position:0%
for them to come and that's part of what
 
01:06:42.390 --> 01:06:42.400 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note in this bill addresses
 
01:06:45.029 --> 01:06:45.039 align:start position:0%
she mentioned the december 2021
 
01:06:46.630 --> 01:06:46.640 align:start position:0%
three-part series and the concord
 
01:06:48.710 --> 01:06:48.720 align:start position:0%
monitor called shots fired which
 
01:06:50.710 --> 01:06:50.720 align:start position:0%
recently won a national award and i
 
01:06:53.190 --> 01:06:53.200 align:start position:0%
encourage you all to read that series
 
01:06:57.109 --> 01:06:57.119 align:start position:0%
there's a link in my written testimony
 
01:06:59.910 --> 01:06:59.920 align:start position:0%
about the 60 of people in new hampshire
 
01:07:01.430 --> 01:07:01.440 align:start position:0%
involved in
 
01:07:03.109 --> 01:07:03.119 align:start position:0%
officer-involved shootings with mental
 
01:07:03.119 --> 01:07:04.710 align:start position:0%
officer-involved shootings with mental
illness

01:07:04.710 --> 01:07:04.720 align:start position:0%
illness
 
01:07:07.190 --> 01:07:07.200 align:start position:0%
and that series was three parts the
 
01:07:09.109 --> 01:07:09.119 align:start position:0%
first part was sort of the
 
01:07:10.630 --> 01:07:10.640 align:start position:0%
how um
 
01:07:13.029 --> 01:07:13.039 align:start position:0%
how police came to be on the front lines
 
01:07:15.029 --> 01:07:15.039 align:start position:0%
of crisis intervention for people in a
 
01:07:17.270 --> 01:07:17.280 align:start position:0%
mental health or substance abuse crisis
 
01:07:17.280 --> 01:07:18.069 align:start position:0%
mental health or substance abuse crisis
and

01:07:18.069 --> 01:07:18.079 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:07:20.069 --> 01:07:20.079 align:start position:0%
and also as holly mentioned that is
 
01:07:21.990 --> 01:07:22.000 align:start position:0%
transforming right now but it's still
 
01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:23.270 align:start position:0%
transforming right now but it's still
certainly

01:07:23.270 --> 01:07:23.280 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
01:07:25.990 --> 01:07:26.000 align:start position:0%
a key issue and the second part was
 
01:07:28.470 --> 01:07:28.480 align:start position:0%
about the impact of the family whose
 
01:07:31.270 --> 01:07:31.280 align:start position:0%
loved one was killed by police this was
 
01:07:32.950 --> 01:07:32.960 align:start position:0%
an incident in meredith and the third
 
01:07:35.029 --> 01:07:35.039 align:start position:0%
part of the series was actually focused
 
01:07:36.870 --> 01:07:36.880 align:start position:0%
on the officer the officer has never
 
01:07:38.789 --> 01:07:38.799 align:start position:0%
returned to duty
 
01:07:40.630 --> 01:07:40.640 align:start position:0%
has severe post-traumatic stress
 
01:07:44.150 --> 01:07:44.160 align:start position:0%
disorder from that incident is disabled
 
01:07:46.870 --> 01:07:46.880 align:start position:0%
and anxiety and it has had a profound
 
01:07:50.870 --> 01:07:50.880 align:start position:0%
impact on him and his family
 
01:07:50.880 --> 01:07:51.670 align:start position:0%
impact on him and his family
the

01:07:51.670 --> 01:07:51.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:53.109 align:start position:0%
the
um

01:07:53.109 --> 01:07:53.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:55.109 --> 01:07:55.119 align:start position:0%
the purpose i want to be clear about the
 
01:07:56.630 --> 01:07:56.640 align:start position:0%
second part of this bill that the
 
01:07:58.470 --> 01:07:58.480 align:start position:0%
purpose of the committee would not be to
 
01:08:00.470 --> 01:08:00.480 align:start position:0%
review the determination of the attorney
 
01:08:03.349 --> 01:08:03.359 align:start position:0%
general's office about whether
 
01:08:05.670 --> 01:08:05.680 align:start position:0%
a shooting was legally justified or not
 
01:08:07.670 --> 01:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
the purpose would be to
 
01:08:07.680 --> 01:08:09.829 align:start position:0%
the purpose would be to
examine

01:08:09.829 --> 01:08:09.839 align:start position:0%
examine
 
01:08:11.910 --> 01:08:11.920 align:start position:0%
what happened before that which might
 
01:08:14.150 --> 01:08:14.160 align:start position:0%
have averted the use of deadly force and
 
01:08:15.430 --> 01:08:15.440 align:start position:0%
what lessons learned might be
 
01:08:17.669 --> 01:08:17.679 align:start position:0%
incorporated into policy and procedure
 
01:08:20.070 --> 01:08:20.080 align:start position:0%
as well as improved training and i would
 
01:08:21.349 --> 01:08:21.359 align:start position:0%
note that
 
01:08:23.990 --> 01:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
that the current reports by the attorney
 
01:08:25.829 --> 01:08:25.839 align:start position:0%
general's office contain this
 
01:08:28.950 --> 01:08:28.960 align:start position:0%
boilerplate language in every report
 
01:08:30.630 --> 01:08:30.640 align:start position:0%
and it says the attorney general does
 
01:08:32.630 --> 01:08:32.640 align:start position:0%
not investigate or opine on the
 
01:08:34.950 --> 01:08:34.960 align:start position:0%
particular procedures or tactics used by
 
01:08:37.269 --> 01:08:37.279 align:start position:0%
law enforcement officers instead the
 
01:08:38.630 --> 01:08:38.640 align:start position:0%
attorney general's review of
 
01:08:41.030 --> 01:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
officer-involved use of deadly force
 
01:08:42.550 --> 01:08:42.560 align:start position:0%
incidents consists of a criminal
 
01:08:44.229 --> 01:08:44.239 align:start position:0%
investigation which is limited to
 
01:08:47.030 --> 01:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
determining whether officers comply with
 
01:08:49.349 --> 01:08:49.359 align:start position:0%
the applicable law
 
01:08:52.149 --> 01:08:52.159 align:start position:0%
and as a specific example i mean i think
 
01:08:54.870 --> 01:08:54.880 align:start position:0%
that the public wants to see some more
 
01:08:56.709 --> 01:08:56.719 align:start position:0%
accountability relative to
 
01:08:59.590 --> 01:08:59.600 align:start position:0%
officer-involved shootings as do members
 
01:09:02.470 --> 01:09:02.480 align:start position:0%
of law enforcement um and the specific
 
01:09:05.829 --> 01:09:05.839 align:start position:0%
specific example which kind of
 
01:09:07.829 --> 01:09:07.839 align:start position:0%
was the catalyst for this coming forward
 
01:09:09.749 --> 01:09:09.759 align:start position:0%
was the shooting in claremont which
 
01:09:09.759 --> 01:09:11.430 align:start position:0%
was the shooting in claremont which
occurred

01:09:11.430 --> 01:09:11.440 align:start position:0%
occurred
 
01:09:13.189 --> 01:09:13.199 align:start position:0%
and the report from the attorney
 
01:09:14.950 --> 01:09:14.960 align:start position:0%
general's office which came out in
 
01:09:17.110 --> 01:09:17.120 align:start position:0%
august of 2021
 
01:09:20.390 --> 01:09:20.400 align:start position:0%
and a 144-page report
 
01:09:20.400 --> 01:09:21.269 align:start position:0%
and a 144-page report
and

01:09:21.269 --> 01:09:21.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:09:23.030 --> 01:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
i think one of the key questions and
 
01:09:25.269 --> 01:09:25.279 align:start position:0%
there are many and i have some more of
 
01:09:27.430 --> 01:09:27.440 align:start position:0%
them in my written testimony but one of
 
01:09:28.870 --> 01:09:28.880 align:start position:0%
the key questions and this was the
 
01:09:31.110 --> 01:09:31.120 align:start position:0%
question that senator gaida called me
 
01:09:34.550 --> 01:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
the next morning and uh and said
 
01:09:36.550 --> 01:09:36.560 align:start position:0%
why did the clermont police fail to take
 
01:09:39.110 --> 01:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
this individual into protective custody
 
01:09:41.269 --> 01:09:41.279 align:start position:0%
or seek to do a compulsory mental status
 
01:09:43.669 --> 01:09:43.679 align:start position:0%
exam when they had contact with him
 
01:09:45.669 --> 01:09:45.679 align:start position:0%
three and a half hours before the
 
01:09:47.669 --> 01:09:47.679 align:start position:0%
incident which then resulted in the swat
 
01:09:47.679 --> 01:09:49.030 align:start position:0%
incident which then resulted in the swat
team

01:09:49.030 --> 01:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
team
 
01:09:51.990 --> 01:09:52.000 align:start position:0%
being called they observed him to be
 
01:09:54.709 --> 01:09:54.719 align:start position:0%
hearing voices to be paranoid and he
 
01:09:56.390 --> 01:09:56.400 align:start position:0%
admitted to
 
01:09:58.470 --> 01:09:58.480 align:start position:0%
having thoughts of suicide
 
01:10:00.550 --> 01:10:00.560 align:start position:0%
and um and there are a number of other
 
01:10:03.270 --> 01:10:03.280 align:start position:0%
things that then transpired relative to
 
01:10:05.669 --> 01:10:05.679 align:start position:0%
the swat team being involved i mean i
 
01:10:07.990 --> 01:10:08.000 align:start position:0%
another question i would ask is whether
 
01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:09.110 align:start position:0%
another question i would ask is whether
um

01:10:09.110 --> 01:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:11.590 --> 01:10:11.600 align:start position:0%
poking in the door of an individual
 
01:10:14.470 --> 01:10:14.480 align:start position:0%
who's known to be armed and um
 
01:10:17.750 --> 01:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
and paranoid um with an armored the pole
 
01:10:20.630 --> 01:10:20.640 align:start position:0%
of an armored vehicle um is the best
 
01:10:23.910 --> 01:10:23.920 align:start position:0%
strategy for resulting in uh a peaceful
 
01:10:26.709 --> 01:10:26.719 align:start position:0%
resolution of this type of incident but
 
01:10:29.830 --> 01:10:29.840 align:start position:0%
um more more questions about that in my
 
01:10:32.070 --> 01:10:32.080 align:start position:0%
written testimony so the purpose of this
 
01:10:34.310 --> 01:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
committee would not be
 
01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:35.910 align:start position:0%
committee would not be
for

01:10:35.910 --> 01:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:10:37.830 --> 01:10:37.840 align:start position:0%
shaming and blaming but it would be to
 
01:10:39.510 --> 01:10:39.520 align:start position:0%
look at how we can reduce these
 
01:10:41.510 --> 01:10:41.520 align:start position:0%
incidents and unless we look more
 
01:10:43.830 --> 01:10:43.840 align:start position:0%
carefully at these incidents
 
01:10:45.510 --> 01:10:45.520 align:start position:0%
we're going to continue with the same
 
01:10:47.990 --> 01:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
outcomes we've had and i would just note
 
01:10:49.750 --> 01:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
that new hampshire has
 
01:10:51.990 --> 01:10:52.000 align:start position:0%
established similar confidential
 
01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:53.510 align:start position:0%
established similar confidential
committees

01:10:53.510 --> 01:10:53.520 align:start position:0%
committees
 
01:10:56.630 --> 01:10:56.640 align:start position:0%
statutory legislative committees for
 
01:10:58.709 --> 01:10:58.719 align:start position:0%
infant and child mortality
 
01:11:03.510 --> 01:11:03.520 align:start position:0%
for suicide for incapacitated um and and
 
01:11:06.149 --> 01:11:06.159 align:start position:0%
older adults so all of these committees
 
01:11:06.159 --> 01:11:07.590 align:start position:0%
older adults so all of these committees
exist

01:11:07.590 --> 01:11:07.600 align:start position:0%
exist
 
01:11:11.110 --> 01:11:11.120 align:start position:0%
and they do investigations in confidence
 
01:11:13.189 --> 01:11:13.199 align:start position:0%
and they report out
 
01:11:15.830 --> 01:11:15.840 align:start position:0%
to particular sources what findings they
 
01:11:17.430 --> 01:11:17.440 align:start position:0%
have that might
 
01:11:19.510 --> 01:11:19.520 align:start position:0%
reduce the incidence of these types of
 
01:11:21.110 --> 01:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
things so these fatality review
 
01:11:24.229 --> 01:11:24.239 align:start position:0%
committees already exist in in the state
 
01:11:27.350 --> 01:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
through the attorney general's office um
 
01:11:29.430 --> 01:11:29.440 align:start position:0%
and i you know also want to clarify i
 
01:11:30.950 --> 01:11:30.960 align:start position:0%
know that there have been some concerns
 
01:11:33.030 --> 01:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
expressed about this bill but want to
 
01:11:35.910 --> 01:11:35.920 align:start position:0%
say very clearly that um of those folks
 
01:11:37.750 --> 01:11:37.760 align:start position:0%
in attendance when the the bill was
 
01:11:39.350 --> 01:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
crafted which included the commissioner
 
01:11:40.950 --> 01:11:40.960 align:start position:0%
of safety commissioner health and human
 
01:11:42.790 --> 01:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
services the attorney general senator
 
01:11:45.830 --> 01:11:45.840 align:start position:0%
guida senator rosenwald a colonel from
 
01:11:47.270 --> 01:11:47.280 align:start position:0%
the state police
 
01:11:49.669 --> 01:11:49.679 align:start position:0%
that that the agreement was that this is
 
01:11:51.510 --> 01:11:51.520 align:start position:0%
a study committee
 
01:11:53.350 --> 01:11:53.360 align:start position:0%
that we're not getting into the details
 
01:11:55.110 --> 01:11:55.120 align:start position:0%
of who should be on the committee how
 
01:11:56.950 --> 01:11:56.960 align:start position:0%
the committee should report out what
 
01:11:59.350 --> 01:11:59.360 align:start position:0%
cases the the committee should choose
 
01:12:00.790 --> 01:12:00.800 align:start position:0%
we're really
 
01:12:03.510 --> 01:12:03.520 align:start position:0%
tasking the legislature with
 
01:12:06.070 --> 01:12:06.080 align:start position:0%
with with studying this and making those
 
01:12:06.080 --> 01:12:07.750 align:start position:0%
with with studying this and making those
recommendations

01:12:07.750 --> 01:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
recommendations
 
01:12:10.229 --> 01:12:10.239 align:start position:0%
i believe that senate bill 376 offers
 
01:12:13.030 --> 01:12:13.040 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to significantly improve
 
01:12:14.950 --> 01:12:14.960 align:start position:0%
law enforcement response to people in a
 
01:12:17.189 --> 01:12:17.199 align:start position:0%
mental health crisis and reduce the use
 
01:12:19.590 --> 01:12:19.600 align:start position:0%
of deadly force in our state and reduce
 
01:12:21.430 --> 01:12:21.440 align:start position:0%
the negative mental health outcomes both
 
01:12:24.149 --> 01:12:24.159 align:start position:0%
for officers involved and for
 
01:12:26.470 --> 01:12:26.480 align:start position:0%
their families and i ask you to vote
 
01:12:28.229 --> 01:12:28.239 align:start position:0%
this bill is ought to pass and i'd be
 
01:12:30.070 --> 01:12:30.080 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions people
 
01:12:30.080 --> 01:12:34.870 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions people
have

01:12:34.870 --> 01:12:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:37.750 --> 01:12:37.760 align:start position:0%
represented muse
 
01:12:39.110 --> 01:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for taking my
 
01:12:42.310 --> 01:12:42.320 align:start position:0%
question um i just have a question about
 
01:12:44.070 --> 01:12:44.080 align:start position:0%
the experience of other states i know
 
01:12:46.070 --> 01:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
that these incidents have taken place
 
01:12:47.990 --> 01:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
not only in new hampshire but but across
 
01:12:49.110 --> 01:12:49.120 align:start position:0%
the country
 
01:12:51.350 --> 01:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
and one of the things i'm curious about
 
01:12:53.750 --> 01:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
is whether other states have taken a
 
01:12:56.070 --> 01:12:56.080 align:start position:0%
similar approach and whether you might
 
01:12:56.080 --> 01:12:57.350 align:start position:0%
similar approach and whether you might
know

01:12:57.350 --> 01:12:57.360 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:12:59.510 --> 01:12:59.520 align:start position:0%
what the outcome has been of some of
 
01:13:01.910 --> 01:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
those commissions that have been set up
 
01:13:03.750 --> 01:13:03.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question um and it's
 
01:13:05.910 --> 01:13:05.920 align:start position:0%
a it's a great question i do know that
 
01:13:08.790 --> 01:13:08.800 align:start position:0%
maine established a public
 
01:13:11.189 --> 01:13:11.199 align:start position:0%
committee legislatively and so it's not
 
01:13:13.910 --> 01:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
a confidential committee but it is
 
01:13:13.920 --> 01:13:15.510 align:start position:0%
a confidential committee but it is
um

01:13:15.510 --> 01:13:15.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:17.510 --> 01:13:17.520 align:start position:0%
and you can google it and and find it it
 
01:13:19.830 --> 01:13:19.840 align:start position:0%
was established i think legislatively
 
01:13:21.590 --> 01:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
two years ago and i believe they just
 
01:13:23.590 --> 01:13:23.600 align:start position:0%
started meeting last year to look at
 
01:13:25.350 --> 01:13:25.360 align:start position:0%
incidents of officer-involved shootings
 
01:13:27.750 --> 01:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
and it names a number of different
 
01:13:29.990 --> 01:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
law enforcement and uh and
 
01:13:32.950 --> 01:13:32.960 align:start position:0%
community players on that committee
 
01:13:36.390 --> 01:13:36.400 align:start position:0%
the um state of connecticut recently
 
01:13:38.709 --> 01:13:38.719 align:start position:0%
they legislatively
 
01:13:42.390 --> 01:13:42.400 align:start position:0%
passed uh created a position of um an
 
01:13:46.070 --> 01:13:46.080 align:start position:0%
investigator general to look at
 
01:13:48.950 --> 01:13:48.960 align:start position:0%
at these incidents in connecticut and
 
01:13:51.350 --> 01:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
and they recently named the person that
 
01:13:53.270 --> 01:13:53.280 align:start position:0%
is going to take that position it's a
 
01:13:55.189 --> 01:13:55.199 align:start position:0%
retired chief justice of their supreme
 
01:13:55.199 --> 01:13:56.390 align:start position:0%
retired chief justice of their supreme
court

01:13:56.390 --> 01:13:56.400 align:start position:0%
court
 
01:13:58.149 --> 01:13:58.159 align:start position:0%
so there there are the some of these
 
01:14:00.790 --> 01:14:00.800 align:start position:0%
committees in other states some many of
 
01:14:02.790 --> 01:14:02.800 align:start position:0%
them are public
 
01:14:06.709 --> 01:14:06.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:06.719 --> 01:14:07.750 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:14:07.750 --> 01:14:07.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:14:09.910 --> 01:14:09.920 align:start position:0%
recognize for a follow-up
 
01:14:12.070 --> 01:14:12.080 align:start position:0%
thank you so so part of the purpose of
 
01:14:14.630 --> 01:14:14.640 align:start position:0%
this committee would be to determine uh
 
01:14:16.229 --> 01:14:16.239 align:start position:0%
what type of structure might be most
 
01:14:18.229 --> 01:14:18.239 align:start position:0%
appropriate for new hampshire given the
 
01:14:20.310 --> 01:14:20.320 align:start position:0%
fact that there is some variability in
 
01:14:22.550 --> 01:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
other states correct yes thanks for your
 
01:14:24.070 --> 01:14:24.080 align:start position:0%
question that's correct
 
01:14:26.630 --> 01:14:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:29.110 --> 01:14:29.120 align:start position:0%
representative pandolakis
 
01:14:31.510 --> 01:14:31.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
01:14:35.030 --> 01:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
taking my question but my question is
 
01:14:37.590 --> 01:14:37.600 align:start position:0%
how do we decide
 
01:14:40.390 --> 01:14:40.400 align:start position:0%
uh how does a police officer decide that
 
01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:41.189 align:start position:0%
uh how does a police officer decide that
a

01:14:41.189 --> 01:14:41.199 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:14:44.149 --> 01:14:44.159 align:start position:0%
person has a mental problem
 
01:14:46.229 --> 01:14:46.239 align:start position:0%
i mean we have a right to
 
01:14:48.229 --> 01:14:48.239 align:start position:0%
have two people talking on our head
 
01:14:51.350 --> 01:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
don't we and things like that
 
01:14:53.350 --> 01:14:53.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question and um and
 
01:14:56.550 --> 01:14:56.560 align:start position:0%
yes that can be a challenge um uh you
 
01:14:59.669 --> 01:14:59.679 align:start position:0%
know and a challenge sometimes um in in
 
01:15:01.669 --> 01:15:01.679 align:start position:0%
many different ways um
 
01:15:03.830 --> 01:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
but that's a lot of what the
 
01:15:05.669 --> 01:15:05.679 align:start position:0%
crisis intervention team training the
 
01:15:08.630 --> 01:15:08.640 align:start position:0%
cit training teaches is how to recognize
 
01:15:11.430 --> 01:15:11.440 align:start position:0%
that how to communicate effectively with
 
01:15:13.350 --> 01:15:13.360 align:start position:0%
somebody that that may have a mental
 
01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:14.790 align:start position:0%
somebody that that may have a mental
illness

01:15:14.790 --> 01:15:14.800 align:start position:0%
illness
 
01:15:16.950 --> 01:15:16.960 align:start position:0%
i think that part of the
 
01:15:18.870 --> 01:15:18.880 align:start position:0%
part of what's unfortunate about these
 
01:15:21.830 --> 01:15:21.840 align:start position:0%
incidents is in that 60 percent is many
 
01:15:24.229 --> 01:15:24.239 align:start position:0%
of these people were known to have a
 
01:15:27.110 --> 01:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
mental illness and um and as the
 
01:15:29.590 --> 01:15:29.600 align:start position:0%
officers responding dispatch is telling
 
01:15:31.510 --> 01:15:31.520 align:start position:0%
them or they've been to that address
 
01:15:36.790 --> 01:15:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:38.790 --> 01:15:38.800 align:start position:0%
so i but i think
 
01:15:40.870 --> 01:15:40.880 align:start position:0%
whether a person has a mental illness or
 
01:15:43.350 --> 01:15:43.360 align:start position:0%
not de-escalation techniques and things
 
01:15:45.750 --> 01:15:45.760 align:start position:0%
that can um that might avert the
 
01:15:48.630 --> 01:15:48.640 align:start position:0%
situation in a more peaceful manner are
 
01:15:51.350 --> 01:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
good skills to have um in any crisis
 
01:15:51.360 --> 01:15:52.950 align:start position:0%
good skills to have um in any crisis
situation

01:15:52.950 --> 01:15:52.960 align:start position:0%
situation
 
01:15:57.270 --> 01:15:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:59.750 --> 01:15:59.760 align:start position:0%
representative harry katherine
 
01:16:02.149 --> 01:16:02.159 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um i
 
01:16:04.070 --> 01:16:04.080 align:start position:0%
it's sort of on the same as
 
01:16:07.030 --> 01:16:07.040 align:start position:0%
my friend from the coast
 
01:16:07.040 --> 01:16:08.470 align:start position:0%
my friend from the coast
um

01:16:08.470 --> 01:16:08.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:11.189 --> 01:16:11.199 align:start position:0%
i wanted to my question is how to see it
 
01:16:13.510 --> 01:16:13.520 align:start position:0%
what does cit look like
 
01:16:15.350 --> 01:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
and i think you kind of hit on it a
 
01:16:17.189 --> 01:16:17.199 align:start position:0%
little bit there because
 
01:16:19.430 --> 01:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
crisis interventions training but what
 
01:16:21.270 --> 01:16:21.280 align:start position:0%
does it actually look like when you guys
 
01:16:25.110 --> 01:16:25.120 align:start position:0%
are training the police department or
 
01:16:26.630 --> 01:16:26.640 align:start position:0%
wherever this is
 
01:16:29.189 --> 01:16:29.199 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for your question and it's
 
01:16:31.910 --> 01:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
it's a really important question because
 
01:16:33.910 --> 01:16:33.920 align:start position:0%
it is internationally recognized and
 
01:16:35.910 --> 01:16:35.920 align:start position:0%
there are parameters for what it is to
 
01:16:37.189 --> 01:16:37.199 align:start position:0%
look like
 
01:16:38.630 --> 01:16:38.640 align:start position:0%
but i think one of the things that's
 
01:16:41.110 --> 01:16:41.120 align:start position:0%
important to know that's somewhat unique
 
01:16:43.030 --> 01:16:43.040 align:start position:0%
to cit is that
 
01:16:44.870 --> 01:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire we use over 20
 
01:16:46.470 --> 01:16:46.480 align:start position:0%
different faculty
 
01:16:48.470 --> 01:16:48.480 align:start position:0%
that come in over the course of that 40
 
01:16:51.030 --> 01:16:51.040 align:start position:0%
hours and almost an equal number of
 
01:16:53.270 --> 01:16:53.280 align:start position:0%
volunteers and
 
01:16:55.510 --> 01:16:55.520 align:start position:0%
those volunteers are trained and they're
 
01:16:57.750 --> 01:16:57.760 align:start position:0%
people with lived experience with mental
 
01:16:57.760 --> 01:16:59.189 align:start position:0%
people with lived experience with mental
illness

01:16:59.189 --> 01:16:59.199 align:start position:0%
illness
 
01:16:59.199 --> 01:17:00.149 align:start position:0%
illness
so

01:17:00.149 --> 01:17:00.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:17:02.709 --> 01:17:02.719 align:start position:0%
in the role play scenarios they may be
 
01:17:04.870 --> 01:17:04.880 align:start position:0%
uh called to deal with a person who's
 
01:17:06.709 --> 01:17:06.719 align:start position:0%
not locked in the bathroom and says
 
01:17:08.390 --> 01:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
they're going to
 
01:17:10.550 --> 01:17:10.560 align:start position:0%
end their life by cutting their wrists
 
01:17:10.560 --> 01:17:11.350 align:start position:0%
end their life by cutting their wrists
and

01:17:11.350 --> 01:17:11.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:17:13.430 --> 01:17:13.440 align:start position:0%
and they go through a role play of
 
01:17:15.189 --> 01:17:15.199 align:start position:0%
trying to talk to the person through the
 
01:17:18.790 --> 01:17:18.800 align:start position:0%
door to get them to open the door
 
01:17:21.590 --> 01:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
and what works and what doesn't work and
 
01:17:23.910 --> 01:17:23.920 align:start position:0%
then they're given feedback at the end
 
01:17:26.149 --> 01:17:26.159 align:start position:0%
and then a lot of times that person who
 
01:17:28.229 --> 01:17:28.239 align:start position:0%
was leading the role play says by the
 
01:17:30.070 --> 01:17:30.080 align:start position:0%
way i was the person locked in the
 
01:17:32.709 --> 01:17:32.719 align:start position:0%
bathroom five years ago
 
01:17:35.030 --> 01:17:35.040 align:start position:0%
wanting to end my life and i think it's
 
01:17:37.590 --> 01:17:37.600 align:start position:0%
really powerful when or i was the mom
 
01:17:40.550 --> 01:17:40.560 align:start position:0%
who called about you know my son
 
01:17:40.560 --> 01:17:42.070 align:start position:0%
who called about you know my son
when

01:17:42.070 --> 01:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
when
 
01:17:44.070 --> 01:17:44.080 align:start position:0%
when he was threatening our family you
 
01:17:46.390 --> 01:17:46.400 align:start position:0%
know and i think it's very powerful to
 
01:17:48.870 --> 01:17:48.880 align:start position:0%
have that experience of communicating
 
01:17:51.430 --> 01:17:51.440 align:start position:0%
with other people and realizing that we
 
01:17:53.910 --> 01:17:53.920 align:start position:0%
are all you know um
 
01:17:56.709 --> 01:17:56.719 align:start position:0%
potentially i'm at risk of having a
 
01:17:58.790 --> 01:17:58.800 align:start position:0%
mental illness at some point in time or
 
01:18:00.790 --> 01:18:00.800 align:start position:0%
feeling like our life isn't worth living
 
01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:01.590 align:start position:0%
feeling like our life isn't worth living
and

01:18:01.590 --> 01:18:01.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:18:04.070 --> 01:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
and it just really humanizes
 
01:18:06.790 --> 01:18:06.800 align:start position:0%
the situation those 20 faculty are very
 
01:18:09.669 --> 01:18:09.679 align:start position:0%
highly regarded folks in our state from
 
01:18:11.030 --> 01:18:11.040 align:start position:0%
from a range of different law
 
01:18:13.990 --> 01:18:14.000 align:start position:0%
enforcement mental health providers
 
01:18:16.310 --> 01:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
family members and
 
01:18:17.669 --> 01:18:17.679 align:start position:0%
and other mental health service
 
01:18:19.830 --> 01:18:19.840 align:start position:0%
providers so coordinating this i mean a
 
01:18:21.350 --> 01:18:21.360 align:start position:0%
lot of the questions are well why can't
 
01:18:23.350 --> 01:18:23.360 align:start position:0%
we just do you know multiple trainings
 
01:18:24.950 --> 01:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
and have you know whatever trained
 
01:18:27.590 --> 01:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
trainers um because it's not the type of
 
01:18:29.430 --> 01:18:29.440 align:start position:0%
training in 40 hours where you know
 
01:18:31.350 --> 01:18:31.360 align:start position:0%
you're dealing with a powerpoint or one
 
01:18:33.510 --> 01:18:33.520 align:start position:0%
trainer who's doing or two trainers who
 
01:18:35.510 --> 01:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
are doing the training it's coordinating
 
01:18:38.070 --> 01:18:38.080 align:start position:0%
these faculty and many of the faculty
 
01:18:41.110 --> 01:18:41.120 align:start position:0%
volunteer and so their ability to
 
01:18:42.790 --> 01:18:42.800 align:start position:0%
provide this training on an ongoing
 
01:18:45.110 --> 01:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
basis and to you know to participate is
 
01:18:46.550 --> 01:18:46.560 align:start position:0%
limited as well
 
01:18:49.110 --> 01:18:49.120 align:start position:0%
so that's that's a good example an idea
 
01:18:51.189 --> 01:18:51.199 align:start position:0%
of what crisis intervention team looks
 
01:18:58.070 --> 01:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:01.430 --> 01:19:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:02.790 --> 01:19:02.800 align:start position:0%
thank you chair
 
01:19:05.510 --> 01:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for taking my question
 
01:19:07.910 --> 01:19:07.920 align:start position:0%
and my understanding is it is not
 
01:19:11.350 --> 01:19:11.360 align:start position:0%
against the law to be mentally ill
 
01:19:14.870 --> 01:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
and if you ring this incident of
 
01:19:18.390 --> 01:19:18.400 align:start position:0%
a man in claremont demonstrating
 
01:19:22.709 --> 01:19:22.719 align:start position:0%
signs of schizophrenia or other mental
 
01:19:22.719 --> 01:19:25.350 align:start position:0%
signs of schizophrenia or other mental
illnesses

01:19:25.350 --> 01:19:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:26.709 --> 01:19:26.719 align:start position:0%
what gives
 
01:19:26.719 --> 01:19:27.750 align:start position:0%
what gives
how

01:19:27.750 --> 01:19:27.760 align:start position:0%
how
 
01:19:30.470 --> 01:19:30.480 align:start position:0%
what is the justification for a police
 
01:19:32.310 --> 01:19:32.320 align:start position:0%
officer to
 
01:19:35.110 --> 01:19:35.120 align:start position:0%
intervene in this instant
 
01:19:37.189 --> 01:19:37.199 align:start position:0%
thanks for your question um
 
01:19:39.030 --> 01:19:39.040 align:start position:0%
yeah i mean this is a very challenging
 
01:19:42.149 --> 01:19:42.159 align:start position:0%
part of um of the law relative to
 
01:19:44.229 --> 01:19:44.239 align:start position:0%
detaining somebody civilly for
 
01:19:46.550 --> 01:19:46.560 align:start position:0%
experiencing um
 
01:19:48.310 --> 01:19:48.320 align:start position:0%
instances of mental illness but the law
 
01:19:51.910 --> 01:19:51.920 align:start position:0%
does provide for law enforcement to take
 
01:19:53.910 --> 01:19:53.920 align:start position:0%
a person into protective custody if they
 
01:19:55.189 --> 01:19:55.199 align:start position:0%
believe that they're a danger to
 
01:19:57.510 --> 01:19:57.520 align:start position:0%
themselves or others
 
01:19:59.110 --> 01:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
and or to
 
01:20:01.910 --> 01:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
fill out or any which anybody can do to
 
01:20:04.709 --> 01:20:04.719 align:start position:0%
fill out a compulsory mental status exam
 
01:20:07.189 --> 01:20:07.199 align:start position:0%
form to have the person brought into the
 
01:20:10.229 --> 01:20:10.239 align:start position:0%
emergency room to be evaluated
 
01:20:11.990 --> 01:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
which would be likewise what you know
 
01:20:13.990 --> 01:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
the police would be bringing taking that
 
01:20:15.830 --> 01:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
person into protective custody to bring
 
01:20:17.350 --> 01:20:17.360 align:start position:0%
them in to have a mental health
 
01:20:19.189 --> 01:20:19.199 align:start position:0%
evaluation done by a mental health
 
01:20:21.669 --> 01:20:21.679 align:start position:0%
professional to see whether
 
01:20:23.430 --> 01:20:23.440 align:start position:0%
there was imminent danger and see
 
01:20:25.110 --> 01:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
whether they met the criteria for an
 
01:20:32.149 --> 01:20:32.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:32.159 --> 01:20:33.110 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:20:33.110 --> 01:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:20:35.830 --> 01:20:35.840 align:start position:0%
but can that intervention actually uh
 
01:20:38.229 --> 01:20:38.239 align:start position:0%
cause more distress for the individual
 
01:20:41.750 --> 01:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
than uh what they're now experiencing
 
01:20:43.750 --> 01:20:43.760 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question it's a
 
01:20:46.390 --> 01:20:46.400 align:start position:0%
great question um depending on who you
 
01:20:48.070 --> 01:20:48.080 align:start position:0%
asked that question of the answer would
 
01:20:50.149 --> 01:20:50.159 align:start position:0%
be yes or no
 
01:20:52.630 --> 01:20:52.640 align:start position:0%
yes certainly an involuntary
 
01:20:55.030 --> 01:20:55.040 align:start position:0%
admission and and you know part of this
 
01:20:56.070 --> 01:20:56.080 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:20:57.830 --> 01:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
typically that
 
01:20:59.669 --> 01:20:59.679 align:start position:0%
being taken into custody involves
 
01:21:01.750 --> 01:21:01.760 align:start position:0%
handcuffs we've had a previous bill
 
01:21:03.510 --> 01:21:03.520 align:start position:0%
which we've you know passed in new
 
01:21:05.990 --> 01:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire relative to the transport if
 
01:21:08.550 --> 01:21:08.560 align:start position:0%
the person is determined to go to meet
 
01:21:10.870 --> 01:21:10.880 align:start position:0%
the criteria that the transport might
 
01:21:13.110 --> 01:21:13.120 align:start position:0%
not involve handcuffs but being taken to
 
01:21:14.630 --> 01:21:14.640 align:start position:0%
the emergency room or taken into
 
01:21:17.189 --> 01:21:17.199 align:start position:0%
protective custody involves handcuffs
 
01:21:19.669 --> 01:21:19.679 align:start position:0%
and being put into a police cruiser
 
01:21:21.910 --> 01:21:21.920 align:start position:0%
which can be very traumatizing to that
 
01:21:21.920 --> 01:21:23.590 align:start position:0%
which can be very traumatizing to that
individual

01:21:23.590 --> 01:21:23.600 align:start position:0%
individual
 
01:21:27.110 --> 01:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
it can also be life-saving and um and i
 
01:21:29.350 --> 01:21:29.360 align:start position:0%
think it's really hard sometimes to sort
 
01:21:31.510 --> 01:21:31.520 align:start position:0%
out what you know what that's going to
 
01:21:33.350 --> 01:21:33.360 align:start position:0%
be but i think a lot of it also really
 
01:21:34.709 --> 01:21:34.719 align:start position:0%
depends on
 
01:21:37.350 --> 01:21:37.360 align:start position:0%
uh the response of the first responders
 
01:21:39.189 --> 01:21:39.199 align:start position:0%
what their communication level is with
 
01:21:40.950 --> 01:21:40.960 align:start position:0%
the person how they walk the person
 
01:21:44.390 --> 01:21:44.400 align:start position:0%
through you know those next steps and
 
01:21:47.110 --> 01:21:47.120 align:start position:0%
and what the potential outcome
 
01:21:47.990 --> 01:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
will be
 
01:21:51.669 --> 01:21:51.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:54.070 --> 01:21:54.080 align:start position:0%
representative newman
 
01:21:55.430 --> 01:21:55.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:21:58.390 --> 01:21:58.400 align:start position:0%
i noticed in your testimony you you um
 
01:22:01.189 --> 01:22:01.199 align:start position:0%
referenced a uh mandatory training that
 
01:22:03.510 --> 01:22:03.520 align:start position:0%
was not accomplished in in a particular
 
01:22:03.520 --> 01:22:04.790 align:start position:0%
was not accomplished in in a particular
incident

01:22:04.790 --> 01:22:04.800 align:start position:0%
incident
 
01:22:07.189 --> 01:22:07.199 align:start position:0%
um is that the cit training and would
 
01:22:09.189 --> 01:22:09.199 align:start position:0%
you be looking into the factors of why
 
01:22:12.950 --> 01:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
that wasn't uh accomplished and
 
01:22:14.790 --> 01:22:14.800 align:start position:0%
statewide whether there is a problem
 
01:22:16.950 --> 01:22:16.960 align:start position:0%
something like that or
 
01:22:19.830 --> 01:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
you also mentioned um
 
01:22:21.990 --> 01:22:22.000 align:start position:0%
you know armored vehicles and and those
 
01:22:24.709 --> 01:22:24.719 align:start position:0%
kind of tactics how you should do that
 
01:22:26.550 --> 01:22:26.560 align:start position:0%
so my question is
 
01:22:28.310 --> 01:22:28.320 align:start position:0%
so you look at these instances because
 
01:22:31.510 --> 01:22:31.520 align:start position:0%
you look at these cases and then you you
 
01:22:33.030 --> 01:22:33.040 align:start position:0%
write a report
 
01:22:36.149 --> 01:22:36.159 align:start position:0%
and the report goes back to someone
 
01:22:38.790 --> 01:22:38.800 align:start position:0%
and then they either correct state laws
 
01:22:41.510 --> 01:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
if they're existent and then
 
01:22:43.990 --> 01:22:44.000 align:start position:0%
or write new laws to to meet that
 
01:22:45.510 --> 01:22:45.520 align:start position:0%
whatever you find out and things ought
 
01:22:46.629 --> 01:22:46.639 align:start position:0%
to be fixed
 
01:22:48.950 --> 01:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
based on your studies that is that how
 
01:22:51.430 --> 01:22:51.440 align:start position:0%
it goes how does it go from a report to
 
01:22:51.440 --> 01:22:52.470 align:start position:0%
it goes how does it go from a report to
actually

01:22:52.470 --> 01:22:52.480 align:start position:0%
actually
 
01:22:54.709 --> 01:22:54.719 align:start position:0%
having effect on correcting the the
 
01:22:57.430 --> 01:22:57.440 align:start position:0%
problems that you that you find
 
01:23:00.070 --> 01:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for your question um
 
01:23:01.669 --> 01:23:01.679 align:start position:0%
i i think that there are several parts
 
01:23:04.709 --> 01:23:04.719 align:start position:0%
of it so the first part was that that
 
01:23:06.629 --> 01:23:06.639 align:start position:0%
that recommendation that cit be
 
01:23:09.030 --> 01:23:09.040 align:start position:0%
mandatory um
 
01:23:11.189 --> 01:23:11.199 align:start position:0%
was from the president's
 
01:23:13.350 --> 01:23:13.360 align:start position:0%
21st century policing report that was a
 
01:23:15.350 --> 01:23:15.360 align:start position:0%
national report
 
01:23:16.790 --> 01:23:16.800 align:start position:0%
i will say that
 
01:23:18.870 --> 01:23:18.880 align:start position:0%
when the leak commission the governor's
 
01:23:20.470 --> 01:23:20.480 align:start position:0%
commission law enforcement
 
01:23:22.390 --> 01:23:22.400 align:start position:0%
accountability community transparency
 
01:23:24.870 --> 01:23:24.880 align:start position:0%
commission discussed that
 
01:23:27.030 --> 01:23:27.040 align:start position:0%
it was a consensus of that committee
 
01:23:28.950 --> 01:23:28.960 align:start position:0%
that it not be
 
01:23:31.590 --> 01:23:31.600 align:start position:0%
mandatory as part of
 
01:23:34.070 --> 01:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
the initial training at police standards
 
01:23:36.229 --> 01:23:36.239 align:start position:0%
and training i'll let director skippa
 
01:23:38.950 --> 01:23:38.960 align:start position:0%
maybe reference some of the complexities
 
01:23:41.189 --> 01:23:41.199 align:start position:0%
of that but i think that
 
01:23:43.110 --> 01:23:43.120 align:start position:0%
and i should say back up a step and say
 
01:23:45.669 --> 01:23:45.679 align:start position:0%
nami new hampshire does provide 16 hours
 
01:23:47.830 --> 01:23:47.840 align:start position:0%
a block of 16 hours of training at
 
01:23:49.430 --> 01:23:49.440 align:start position:0%
police standards and training for every
 
01:23:51.910 --> 01:23:51.920 align:start position:0%
recruit that comes through
 
01:23:53.990 --> 01:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
much of that is some of the basics of
 
01:23:56.390 --> 01:23:56.400 align:start position:0%
what crisis intervention team training
 
01:23:58.950 --> 01:23:58.960 align:start position:0%
was i think in conversations we've had
 
01:23:58.960 --> 01:24:00.390 align:start position:0%
was i think in conversations we've had
informally

01:24:00.390 --> 01:24:00.400 align:start position:0%
informally
 
01:24:03.270 --> 01:24:03.280 align:start position:0%
if if that were to be mandatory it might
 
01:24:05.350 --> 01:24:05.360 align:start position:0%
be a lot better doing it a year out when
 
01:24:06.790 --> 01:24:06.800 align:start position:0%
they're you know when they're not sort
 
01:24:09.590 --> 01:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
of in that um fire hose of training that
 
01:24:11.830 --> 01:24:11.840 align:start position:0%
that comes through the academy so
 
01:24:11.840 --> 01:24:12.629 align:start position:0%
that comes through the academy so
um

01:24:12.629 --> 01:24:12.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:14.310 --> 01:24:14.320 align:start position:0%
but you know i will also say that some
 
01:24:17.110 --> 01:24:17.120 align:start position:0%
departments have chosen to make cit
 
01:24:19.350 --> 01:24:19.360 align:start position:0%
training mandatory in new hampshire they
 
01:24:20.950 --> 01:24:20.960 align:start position:0%
tend to be the larger departments that
 
01:24:23.910 --> 01:24:23.920 align:start position:0%
have more resources available to them
 
01:24:26.390 --> 01:24:26.400 align:start position:0%
the second part of your question
 
01:24:30.550 --> 01:24:30.560 align:start position:0%
i think is a little more complicated and
 
01:24:30.560 --> 01:24:31.510 align:start position:0%
i think is a little more complicated and
and

01:24:31.510 --> 01:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:24:33.430 --> 01:24:33.440 align:start position:0%
i will try to answer but i will preface
 
01:24:35.510 --> 01:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
it by saying that that's really what the
 
01:24:37.430 --> 01:24:37.440 align:start position:0%
study committee would look at is you
 
01:24:40.310 --> 01:24:40.320 align:start position:0%
know making recommendations for how
 
01:24:42.070 --> 01:24:42.080 align:start position:0%
how those reports would be issued who
 
01:24:44.229 --> 01:24:44.239 align:start position:0%
would have access to those reports but
 
01:24:46.870 --> 01:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
you know generally speaking i
 
01:24:48.629 --> 01:24:48.639 align:start position:0%
i don't think it would necessarily be
 
01:24:50.470 --> 01:24:50.480 align:start position:0%
legislative things that would be coming
 
01:24:52.070 --> 01:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
out of it it would be recommendations
 
01:24:53.990 --> 01:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
about policies and procedures and
 
01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:55.510 align:start position:0%
about policies and procedures and
training

01:24:55.510 --> 01:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
training
 
01:24:57.110 --> 01:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
and again would like would defer to
 
01:24:59.030 --> 01:24:59.040 align:start position:0%
director skipa but you know i know in
 
01:25:01.750 --> 01:25:01.760 align:start position:0%
conversations that we have had um that
 
01:25:03.430 --> 01:25:03.440 align:start position:0%
i've had with him he's talked about the
 
01:25:05.910 --> 01:25:05.920 align:start position:0%
ability to use some of these incidents
 
01:25:08.550 --> 01:25:08.560 align:start position:0%
um as part of the simulations that they
 
01:25:11.990 --> 01:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
do at the police academy um and
 
01:25:14.390 --> 01:25:14.400 align:start position:0%
particularly after there was some types
 
01:25:16.310 --> 01:25:16.320 align:start position:0%
of recommendations made about how things
 
01:25:19.189 --> 01:25:19.199 align:start position:0%
might have happened differently
 
01:25:24.550 --> 01:25:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:26.709 --> 01:25:26.719 align:start position:0%
representative muse
 
01:25:28.310 --> 01:25:28.320 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for taking my question
 
01:25:29.910 --> 01:25:29.920 align:start position:0%
again um
 
01:25:29.920 --> 01:25:31.270 align:start position:0%
again um
uh

01:25:31.270 --> 01:25:31.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:25:33.430 --> 01:25:33.440 align:start position:0%
this has been uh something that has been
 
01:25:36.870 --> 01:25:36.880 align:start position:0%
out there i think since 2018 or 2019
 
01:25:39.189 --> 01:25:39.199 align:start position:0%
according to the concord monitor article
 
01:25:39.199 --> 01:25:40.790 align:start position:0%
according to the concord monitor article
and

01:25:40.790 --> 01:25:40.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:25:43.110 --> 01:25:43.120 align:start position:0%
the article also says 60
 
01:25:44.950 --> 01:25:44.960 align:start position:0%
of uh officer
 
01:25:46.870 --> 01:25:46.880 align:start position:0%
uh involved shootings do involve people
 
01:25:49.030 --> 01:25:49.040 align:start position:0%
with mental health issues
 
01:25:51.510 --> 01:25:51.520 align:start position:0%
something i'm curious about is
 
01:25:54.870 --> 01:25:54.880 align:start position:0%
what have we seen in terms of
 
01:25:57.110 --> 01:25:57.120 align:start position:0%
results so i guess we hear about the
 
01:25:57.120 --> 01:25:58.390 align:start position:0%
results so i guess we hear about the
negative

01:25:58.390 --> 01:25:58.400 align:start position:0%
negative
 
01:26:00.470 --> 01:26:00.480 align:start position:0%
the negative cases we hear about the
 
01:26:00.480 --> 01:26:03.030 align:start position:0%
the negative cases we hear about the
shootings

01:26:03.030 --> 01:26:03.040 align:start position:0%
shootings
 
01:26:04.950 --> 01:26:04.960 align:start position:0%
what are we not hearing
 
01:26:07.270 --> 01:26:07.280 align:start position:0%
in terms of how this intervention has
 
01:26:09.270 --> 01:26:09.280 align:start position:0%
actually helped officers
 
01:26:12.149 --> 01:26:12.159 align:start position:0%
handle these incidents uh more
 
01:26:13.910 --> 01:26:13.920 align:start position:0%
successfully and with that with better
 
01:26:15.990 --> 01:26:16.000 align:start position:0%
outcomes are there are there stories
 
01:26:18.149 --> 01:26:18.159 align:start position:0%
there that we should know
 
01:26:20.229 --> 01:26:20.239 align:start position:0%
thanks for your question and uh yes it's
 
01:26:23.030 --> 01:26:23.040 align:start position:0%
a it's a it's a great question um there
 
01:26:25.030 --> 01:26:25.040 align:start position:0%
are a lot of stories about i mean one
 
01:26:26.550 --> 01:26:26.560 align:start position:0%
that comes to mind i think it was the
 
01:26:28.470 --> 01:26:28.480 align:start position:0%
first cit training that we did in the
 
01:26:28.480 --> 01:26:30.310 align:start position:0%
first cit training that we did in the
state

01:26:30.310 --> 01:26:30.320 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:26:32.229 --> 01:26:32.239 align:start position:0%
which was three and a half years ago and
 
01:26:34.790 --> 01:26:34.800 align:start position:0%
within several days
 
01:26:36.629 --> 01:26:36.639 align:start position:0%
a state trooper pulled somebody over for
 
01:26:38.950 --> 01:26:38.960 align:start position:0%
speeding and um
 
01:26:42.950 --> 01:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
and things escalated and uh and
 
01:26:45.430 --> 01:26:45.440 align:start position:0%
they were about to make an arrest
 
01:26:47.350 --> 01:26:47.360 align:start position:0%
i don't remember the exact particulars
 
01:26:48.870 --> 01:26:48.880 align:start position:0%
but realized that what they were dealing
 
01:26:51.110 --> 01:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
with was a mental health problem and
 
01:26:53.430 --> 01:26:53.440 align:start position:0%
they instead brought the person to the
 
01:26:56.709 --> 01:26:56.719 align:start position:0%
emergency room the person did say later
 
01:26:58.229 --> 01:26:58.239 align:start position:0%
that they were intent on killing
 
01:27:00.550 --> 01:27:00.560 align:start position:0%
themselves and that you know that that
 
01:27:03.030 --> 01:27:03.040 align:start position:0%
intervention saved their life
 
01:27:04.470 --> 01:27:04.480 align:start position:0%
you know unfortunately
 
01:27:06.629 --> 01:27:06.639 align:start position:0%
as we know with the media we focus on
 
01:27:08.390 --> 01:27:08.400 align:start position:0%
negative events rather than positive
 
01:27:11.350 --> 01:27:11.360 align:start position:0%
events and um and as we look to try to
 
01:27:13.990 --> 01:27:14.000 align:start position:0%
change the culture um relative to law
 
01:27:16.229 --> 01:27:16.239 align:start position:0%
enforcement i i keep talking about you
 
01:27:18.550 --> 01:27:18.560 align:start position:0%
know that we need to have ceremonies and
 
01:27:21.270 --> 01:27:21.280 align:start position:0%
have awards for law enforcement officers
 
01:27:23.430 --> 01:27:23.440 align:start position:0%
that do make these decisions that you
 
01:27:25.750 --> 01:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
know that end up with a positive outcome
 
01:27:25.760 --> 01:27:26.629 align:start position:0%
know that end up with a positive outcome
um

01:27:26.629 --> 01:27:26.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:28.950 --> 01:27:28.960 align:start position:0%
that might have gone the other way so
 
01:27:31.110 --> 01:27:31.120 align:start position:0%
there's there are certainly many stories
 
01:27:32.550 --> 01:27:32.560 align:start position:0%
of how
 
01:27:32.560 --> 01:27:33.830 align:start position:0%
of how
effective

01:27:33.830 --> 01:27:33.840 align:start position:0%

01:27:36.870 --> 01:27:36.880 align:start position:0%
crisis intervention team training is in
 
01:27:38.070 --> 01:27:38.080 align:start position:0%
in changing
 
01:27:39.910 --> 01:27:39.920 align:start position:0%
response of first responders after
 
01:27:46.790 --> 01:27:46.800 align:start position:0%

of that first million
 
01:30:41.110 --> 01:30:41.120 align:start position:0%
it looks like
 
01:30:46.870 --> 01:30:46.880 align:start position:0%
we only have 114 000 left to allocate
 
01:30:50.310 --> 01:30:50.320 align:start position:0%
in senate bill 401 it sends 67 million
 
01:30:52.470 --> 01:30:52.480 align:start position:0%
of our project projected fiscal year
 
01:30:52.480 --> 01:30:53.910 align:start position:0%
of our project projected fiscal year

01:30:56.390 --> 01:30:56.400 align:start position:0%
surplus back to the taxpayers
 
01:30:58.470 --> 01:30:58.480 align:start position:0%
lastly at the request of the department
 
01:31:01.350 --> 01:31:01.360 align:start position:0%
of transportation we added language
 
01:31:03.430 --> 01:31:03.440 align:start position:0%
adding the department
 
01:31:06.070 --> 01:31:06.080 align:start position:0%
to operate dash cams in its fleet of
 
01:31:06.080 --> 01:31:07.270 align:start position:0%
to operate dash cams in its fleet of
vehicles

01:31:07.270 --> 01:31:07.280 align:start position:0%
vehicles
 
01:31:09.830 --> 01:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
this does not negate restrictions on
 
01:31:12.390 --> 01:31:12.400 align:start position:0%
video surveillance at the turnpike toll
 
01:31:12.400 --> 01:31:13.669 align:start position:0%
video surveillance at the turnpike toll
plazas

01:31:13.669 --> 01:31:13.679 align:start position:0%
plazas
 
01:31:15.590 --> 01:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
when the state collects more revenue
 
01:31:17.430 --> 01:31:17.440 align:start position:0%
than it expects we should return it to
 
01:31:19.590 --> 01:31:19.600 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers of new hampshire we should
 
01:31:21.910 --> 01:31:21.920 align:start position:0%
not use the surplus to increase the
 
01:31:24.070 --> 01:31:24.080 align:start position:0%
baseline of state spending
 
01:31:26.470 --> 01:31:26.480 align:start position:0%
that is unsustainable and will leave us
 
01:31:28.310 --> 01:31:28.320 align:start position:0%
in a hole when the legislature starts
 
01:31:30.390 --> 01:31:30.400 align:start position:0%
putting together the next budget
 
01:31:32.310 --> 01:31:32.320 align:start position:0%
with prices rising on everything from
 
01:31:34.390 --> 01:31:34.400 align:start position:0%
gas to groceries new hampshire families
 
01:31:36.709 --> 01:31:36.719 align:start position:0%
need a break providing property tax
 
01:31:39.430 --> 01:31:39.440 align:start position:0%
relief through senate bill 401
 
01:31:41.510 --> 01:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
is how we can put a share of the state
 
01:31:43.510 --> 01:31:43.520 align:start position:0%
surplus in their pockets
 
01:31:46.229 --> 01:31:46.239 align:start position:0%
this bill received a 24-0 vote in the
 
01:31:47.750 --> 01:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
new hampshire senate and i'm hoping to
 
01:31:49.990 --> 01:31:50.000 align:start position:0%
receive a unanimous approval as well
 
01:31:51.750 --> 01:31:51.760 align:start position:0%
from the house i thank you for
 
01:31:53.990 --> 01:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
consideration and ask for your support
 
01:32:02.149 --> 01:32:02.159 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chair and thank you for

think you know all of us here support
 
01:32:13.590 --> 01:32:13.600 align:start position:0%
making sure we have good bridges good
 
01:32:15.510 --> 01:32:15.520 align:start position:0%
roads um the part that i think that
 
01:32:18.070 --> 01:32:18.080 align:start position:0%
really relates to us is the body cams
 
01:32:20.550 --> 01:32:20.560 align:start position:0%
and the dashboard cameras how much
 
01:32:22.310 --> 01:32:22.320 align:start position:0%
so i know we're getting a million which
 
01:32:23.990 --> 01:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
you know getting any money any funding
 
01:32:26.390 --> 01:32:26.400 align:start position:0%
for it is great um how much would it
 
01:32:28.629 --> 01:32:28.639 align:start position:0%
cost to get like you know to make sure
 
01:32:31.189 --> 01:32:31.199 align:start position:0%
we actually implement like uh the
 
01:32:34.149 --> 01:32:34.159 align:start position:0%
full-on program for the body cams and
 
01:32:36.070 --> 01:32:36.080 align:start position:0%
and dash cams well the department's here
 
01:32:38.350 --> 01:32:38.360 align:start position:0%
to speak to that but the piece of
 
01:32:40.870 --> 01:32:40.880 align:start position:0%
legislation that
 
01:32:43.350 --> 01:32:43.360 align:start position:0%
made this happen in the senate had a 20
 
01:32:45.910 --> 01:32:45.920 align:start position:0%
million dollar estimate it was about 3
 
01:32:47.990 --> 01:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
300 offices
 
01:32:49.990 --> 01:32:50.000 align:start position:0%
if you fully equip them
 
01:32:57.030 --> 01:32:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:58.550 --> 01:32:58.560 align:start position:0%
seeing no hands raised thank you senator
 
01:33:00.550 --> 01:33:00.560 align:start position:0%
for your testimony thank you
 
01:33:03.750 --> 01:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:14.229 --> 01:33:14.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:15.910 --> 01:33:15.920 align:start position:0%
good morning mr chairman and members of
 
01:33:17.669 --> 01:33:17.679 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is katherine heck
 
01:33:19.430 --> 01:33:19.440 align:start position:0%
i represent the new hampshire municipal
 
01:33:21.350 --> 01:33:21.360 align:start position:0%
association and we are here to strongly
 
01:33:25.430 --> 01:33:25.440 align:start position:0%
support senate bill 401 as amended
 
01:33:27.430 --> 01:33:27.440 align:start position:0%
spending money on our bridges we have
 
01:33:29.350 --> 01:33:29.360 align:start position:0%
currently a 10-year waiting list for our
 
01:33:31.750 --> 01:33:31.760 align:start position:0%
red listed bridges and 6.8 million
 
01:33:34.149 --> 01:33:34.159 align:start position:0%
dollars in the budget right now so 30
 
01:33:36.470 --> 01:33:36.480 align:start position:0%
million dollars 36 million dollars is
 
01:33:39.189 --> 01:33:39.199 align:start position:0%
going to go far to move forward some of
 
01:33:41.350 --> 01:33:41.360 align:start position:0%
those other projects that are in the
 
01:33:41.360 --> 01:33:42.470 align:start position:0%
those other projects that are in the
queue

01:33:42.470 --> 01:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
queue
 
01:33:44.709 --> 01:33:44.719 align:start position:0%
our highways and roads as you know are
 
01:33:46.310 --> 01:33:46.320 align:start position:0%
highway block grants that this would
 
01:33:48.790 --> 01:33:48.800 align:start position:0%
fund will also help municipalities
 
01:33:50.870 --> 01:33:50.880 align:start position:0%
be able to continue with that road work
 
01:33:53.350 --> 01:33:53.360 align:start position:0%
that we know is so important however the
 
01:33:55.669 --> 01:33:55.679 align:start position:0%
only thing we're requesting is that some
 
01:33:57.189 --> 01:33:57.199 align:start position:0%
language be amended so that
 
01:33:59.830 --> 01:33:59.840 align:start position:0%
municipalities can in fact receive these
 
01:33:59.840 --> 01:34:01.030 align:start position:0%
municipalities can in fact receive these
funds

01:34:01.030 --> 01:34:01.040 align:start position:0%
funds
 
01:34:02.870 --> 01:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
as unanticipated money has to be
 
01:34:06.229 --> 01:34:06.239 align:start position:0%
accepted under rsa 3195b
 
01:34:08.149 --> 01:34:08.159 align:start position:0%
and that provision has to be adopted by
 
01:34:11.590 --> 01:34:11.600 align:start position:0%
the legislative body so in 2017 when
 
01:34:13.910 --> 01:34:13.920 align:start position:0%
similar legislation passed they added
 
01:34:16.950 --> 01:34:16.960 align:start position:0%
this language that we've supplied to
 
01:34:18.629 --> 01:34:18.639 align:start position:0%
ensure that municipalities will be able
 
01:34:20.950 --> 01:34:20.960 align:start position:0%
to accept and receive these funds as our
 
01:34:22.790 --> 01:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
annual meetings have just
 
01:34:24.070 --> 01:34:24.080 align:start position:0%
we've just gone through our annual
 
01:34:25.669 --> 01:34:25.679 align:start position:0%
meetings or we're about to have them and
 
01:34:28.310 --> 01:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
these funds will become available in 22
 
01:34:30.550 --> 01:34:30.560 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately towns receiving those
 
01:34:32.310 --> 01:34:32.320 align:start position:0%
funds would not be able to use them
 
01:34:34.189 --> 01:34:34.199 align:start position:0%
because they can't accept them until
 
01:34:34.199 --> 01:34:35.750 align:start position:0%
because they can't accept them until
2023

01:34:35.750 --> 01:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
2023
 
01:34:37.750 --> 01:34:37.760 align:start position:0%
so i can certainly take any questions
 
01:34:39.189 --> 01:34:39.199 align:start position:0%
you might have for me and i thank you
 
01:34:41.030 --> 01:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
for your time and we are excited for
 
01:34:51.350 --> 01:34:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:53.990 --> 01:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
representative pandolakis
 
01:34:55.750 --> 01:34:55.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
01:34:58.709 --> 01:34:58.719 align:start position:0%
does that law also cover
 
01:35:02.070 --> 01:35:02.080 align:start position:0%
the towns and cities being able to use
 
01:35:02.080 --> 01:35:02.950 align:start position:0%
the towns and cities being able to use
this

01:35:02.950 --> 01:35:02.960 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:35:05.990 --> 01:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
money for what they choose to use it for
 
01:35:08.550 --> 01:35:08.560 align:start position:0%
such as a bridge or a road
 
01:35:10.310 --> 01:35:10.320 align:start position:0%
so um as
 
01:35:12.229 --> 01:35:12.239 align:start position:0%
the grant the monies would have to be
 
01:35:14.149 --> 01:35:14.159 align:start position:0%
accepted under the rsa through a public
 
01:35:15.990 --> 01:35:16.000 align:start position:0%
hearing and they have to be used for
 
01:35:17.669 --> 01:35:17.679 align:start position:0%
what they were intended for the language
 
01:35:19.910 --> 01:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
we're adding to the bill
 
01:35:22.070 --> 01:35:22.080 align:start position:0%
as you can if you read the written
 
01:35:24.629 --> 01:35:24.639 align:start position:0%
testimony i presented would prohibit
 
01:35:28.070 --> 01:35:28.080 align:start position:0%
municipalities from supplanting so just
 
01:35:29.910 --> 01:35:29.920 align:start position:0%
they would have to supplement and move
 
01:35:32.470 --> 01:35:32.480 align:start position:0%
projects forward do additional projects
 
01:35:34.390 --> 01:35:34.400 align:start position:0%
so that it is in fact getting the
 
01:35:36.229 --> 01:35:36.239 align:start position:0%
communities forward this was the same
 
01:35:38.790 --> 01:35:38.800 align:start position:0%
language used in 2017
 
01:35:40.390 --> 01:35:40.400 align:start position:0%
and they would have to use the funds for
 
01:35:41.990 --> 01:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
the purpose for which they were intended
 
01:35:43.750 --> 01:35:43.760 align:start position:0%
so the highway block grant can only be
 
01:35:46.550 --> 01:35:46.560 align:start position:0%
used to maintain roads or purchase the
 
01:35:48.550 --> 01:35:48.560 align:start position:0%
equipment directly associated with
 
01:35:51.030 --> 01:35:51.040 align:start position:0%
maintaining roads or for matching grants
 
01:35:53.270 --> 01:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
for say federal dollars the bridge aid
 
01:35:55.510 --> 01:35:55.520 align:start position:0%
can only be used for bridge repair and
 
01:35:57.910 --> 01:35:57.920 align:start position:0%
reconstruction and of course the body
 
01:35:59.270 --> 01:35:59.280 align:start position:0%
dash cam
 
01:36:01.350 --> 01:36:01.360 align:start position:0%
is a grant that you apply for so it has
 
01:36:03.270 --> 01:36:03.280 align:start position:0%
a very specific purpose and can only be
 
01:36:05.350 --> 01:36:05.360 align:start position:0%
used in that manner
 
01:36:09.430 --> 01:36:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:12.470 --> 01:36:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:14.149 --> 01:36:14.159 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh thank you for
 
01:36:15.910 --> 01:36:15.920 align:start position:0%
taking my question the amendment you
 
01:36:18.550 --> 01:36:18.560 align:start position:0%
were talking about is that rep is that
 
01:36:18.560 --> 01:36:19.669 align:start position:0%
were talking about is that rep is that
uh

01:36:19.669 --> 01:36:19.679 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:36:23.270 --> 01:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:25.830 --> 01:36:25.840 align:start position:0%
i don't have any any amount i didn't see
 
01:36:27.350 --> 01:36:27.360 align:start position:0%
any amenities like the language we were
 
01:36:28.550 --> 01:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
01:36:31.030 --> 01:36:31.040 align:start position:0%
we were represented at last yesterday
 
01:36:32.790 --> 01:36:32.800 align:start position:0%
afternoon representative that wasn't
 
01:36:33.990 --> 01:36:34.000 align:start position:0%
shared with us
 
01:36:35.990 --> 01:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
in fairness to the witness to ask her
 
01:36:37.030 --> 01:36:37.040 align:start position:0%
they asked the witness about an
 
01:36:38.950 --> 01:36:38.960 align:start position:0%
amendment that she doesn't have if a
 
01:36:38.960 --> 01:36:39.910 align:start position:0%
amendment that she doesn't have if a
member

01:36:39.910 --> 01:36:39.920 align:start position:0%
member
 
01:36:42.870 --> 01:36:42.880 align:start position:0%
would like to hand it to the witness and
 
01:36:44.629 --> 01:36:44.639 align:start position:0%
if the witness wishes to comment on some
 
01:36:54.390 --> 01:36:54.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:55.990 --> 01:36:56.000 align:start position:0%
well i did hear some discussion that
 
01:36:57.510 --> 01:36:57.520 align:start position:0%
this was being considered and we just
 
01:37:00.390 --> 01:37:00.400 align:start position:0%
wanted to be sure um i certainly could
 
01:37:01.990 --> 01:37:02.000 align:start position:0%
take a few moments
 
01:37:03.910 --> 01:37:03.920 align:start position:0%
and ensure that it meets all the
 
01:37:06.790 --> 01:37:06.800 align:start position:0%
statutory requirements but we were not
 
01:37:08.229 --> 01:37:08.239 align:start position:0%
aware that the amendment had actually
 
01:37:09.350 --> 01:37:09.360 align:start position:0%
gone through
 
01:37:09.360 --> 01:37:10.390 align:start position:0%
gone through
um

01:37:10.390 --> 01:37:10.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:11.669 --> 01:37:11.679 align:start position:0%
the office's legislative statement and
 
01:37:13.189 --> 01:37:13.199 align:start position:0%
just declared that that amendment has
 
01:37:14.870 --> 01:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
not been approved it was just literally
 
01:37:16.550 --> 01:37:16.560 align:start position:0%
handed to the committee about
 
01:37:18.229 --> 01:37:18.239 align:start position:0%
five minutes ago oh and that happens all
 
01:37:20.629 --> 01:37:20.639 align:start position:0%
the time that's no problem sir
 
01:37:22.310 --> 01:37:22.320 align:start position:0%
so if i could just take some time to
 
01:37:23.910 --> 01:37:23.920 align:start position:0%
review that we just want to make sure
 
01:37:25.910 --> 01:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
there's no holes or gaps so these funds
 
01:37:28.470 --> 01:37:28.480 align:start position:0%
if approved by the house can be used for
 
01:37:29.990 --> 01:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
the purpose in which you all have
 
01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:33.510 align:start position:0%
the purpose in which you all have
intended

01:37:33.510 --> 01:37:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:35.270 --> 01:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
so may i email the chair of the
 
01:37:37.030 --> 01:37:37.040 align:start position:0%
committee um after the meeting so i
 
01:37:38.550 --> 01:37:38.560 align:start position:0%

01:37:40.550 --> 01:37:40.560 align:start position:0%

and i'll call some other witnesses thank
 
01:37:52.310 --> 01:37:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:57.030 --> 01:37:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:06.790 --> 01:38:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:08.149 --> 01:38:08.159 align:start position:0%
good morning mr chair members of the
 
01:38:09.590 --> 01:38:09.600 align:start position:0%
committee steve lavoy i'm the director
 
01:38:11.430 --> 01:38:11.440 align:start position:0%
of administration for the department of
 
01:38:13.910 --> 01:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
safety um the department of safety does
 
01:38:16.950 --> 01:38:16.960 align:start position:0%
not take any position on this this bill
 
01:38:18.550 --> 01:38:18.560 align:start position:0%
as is although we do
 
01:38:20.709 --> 01:38:20.719 align:start position:0%
support the use of body cameras
 
01:38:22.390 --> 01:38:22.400 align:start position:0%
throughout the state
 
01:38:23.910 --> 01:38:23.920 align:start position:0%
i'm here to provide
 
01:38:25.669 --> 01:38:25.679 align:start position:0%
some information about the body camera
 
01:38:27.590 --> 01:38:27.600 align:start position:0%
grant program and answer any questions
 
01:38:29.270 --> 01:38:29.280 align:start position:0%
associated with that
 
01:38:32.070 --> 01:38:32.080 align:start position:0%
as senator morse mentioned the first
 
01:38:34.070 --> 01:38:34.080 align:start position:0%
round of funding was a million dollars
 
01:38:35.669 --> 01:38:35.679 align:start position:0%
that was appropriated to the body camera
 
01:38:36.629 --> 01:38:36.639 align:start position:0%
and dash
 
01:38:38.390 --> 01:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
camera fund
 
01:38:41.109 --> 01:38:41.119 align:start position:0%
there were 29 applicants all 29
 
01:38:41.119 --> 01:38:42.550 align:start position:0%
there were 29 applicants all 29
applications

01:38:42.550 --> 01:38:42.560 align:start position:0%
applications
 
01:38:44.550 --> 01:38:44.560 align:start position:0%
are receiving funding in some way shape
 
01:38:46.550 --> 01:38:46.560 align:start position:0%
or form and there is approximately a
 
01:38:48.310 --> 01:38:48.320 align:start position:0%
hundred and fourteen thousand dollars
 
01:38:50.550 --> 01:38:50.560 align:start position:0%
remaining within that fund so this bill
 
01:38:52.629 --> 01:38:52.639 align:start position:0%
would add one million dollars
 
01:38:54.229 --> 01:38:54.239 align:start position:0%
to the dashboard
 
01:38:57.189 --> 01:38:57.199 align:start position:0%
and body camera fund allowing us to
 
01:38:59.590 --> 01:38:59.600 align:start position:0%
go through with another grant
 
01:39:01.750 --> 01:39:01.760 align:start position:0%
another grant process
 
01:39:01.760 --> 01:39:02.550 align:start position:0%
another grant process
there's

01:39:02.550 --> 01:39:02.560 align:start position:0%
there's
 
01:39:04.629 --> 01:39:04.639 align:start position:0%
as we mentioned there were there were 29
 
01:39:04.639 --> 01:39:06.070 align:start position:0%
as we mentioned there were there were 29
applicants

01:39:06.070 --> 01:39:06.080 align:start position:0%
applicants
 
01:39:07.990 --> 01:39:08.000 align:start position:0%
over 200 municipalities in the state we
 
01:39:09.669 --> 01:39:09.679 align:start position:0%
do believe that there are others that
 
01:39:11.510 --> 01:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
might be interested in submitting
 
01:39:13.590 --> 01:39:13.600 align:start position:0%
applications and i'm happy to address
 
01:39:17.910 --> 01:39:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:20.550 --> 01:39:20.560 align:start position:0%
representative espio
 
01:39:22.229 --> 01:39:22.239 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and
 
01:39:23.430 --> 01:39:23.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question just
 
01:39:25.910 --> 01:39:25.920 align:start position:0%
similar question that i asked earlier
 
01:39:28.629 --> 01:39:28.639 align:start position:0%
how much would it cost to fully you know
 
01:39:31.109 --> 01:39:31.119 align:start position:0%
to to really pay for i mean i love the
 
01:39:32.709 --> 01:39:32.719 align:start position:0%
idea of grants and being able to provide
 
01:39:33.910 --> 01:39:33.920 align:start position:0%
some funding but how much would it
 
01:39:35.830 --> 01:39:35.840 align:start position:0%
actually cost to like you know do it
 
01:39:36.870 --> 01:39:36.880 align:start position:0%
throughout the entire state of new
 
01:39:36.880 --> 01:39:38.070 align:start position:0%
throughout the entire state of new
hampshire

01:39:38.070 --> 01:39:38.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:39:39.270 --> 01:39:39.280 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for the question so as
 
01:39:41.109 --> 01:39:41.119 align:start position:0%
senator morse um
 
01:39:43.750 --> 01:39:43.760 align:start position:0%
indicated there's over 3 300 law
 
01:39:46.629 --> 01:39:46.639 align:start position:0%
enforcement officers in the state um
 
01:39:49.109 --> 01:39:49.119 align:start position:0%
during the senate consideration for this
 
01:39:49.119 --> 01:39:50.070 align:start position:0%
during the senate consideration for this
bill

01:39:50.070 --> 01:39:50.080 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:39:52.149 --> 01:39:52.159 align:start position:0%
we worked with with the senate to come
 
01:39:53.669 --> 01:39:53.679 align:start position:0%
up with those estimates the 20 million
 
01:39:56.629 --> 01:39:56.639 align:start position:0%
dollars is the full cost amount
 
01:39:58.310 --> 01:39:58.320 align:start position:0%
there were just questions about funding
 
01:40:00.149 --> 01:40:00.159 align:start position:0%
50 of that which would obviously bring
 
01:40:02.390 --> 01:40:02.400 align:start position:0%
it down to around 11 million
 
01:40:05.030 --> 01:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
the only concern or consideration would
 
01:40:06.070 --> 01:40:06.080 align:start position:0%
be if
 
01:40:07.990 --> 01:40:08.000 align:start position:0%
if the program were expanded to that
 
01:40:09.750 --> 01:40:09.760 align:start position:0%
size we would have some additional
 
01:40:12.149 --> 01:40:12.159 align:start position:0%
staffing requirements um
 
01:40:13.750 --> 01:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
with a million dollars we feel
 
01:40:14.950 --> 01:40:14.960 align:start position:0%
comfortable that there won't be any
 
01:40:17.270 --> 01:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
additional uh staffing requirements to
 
01:40:22.149 --> 01:40:22.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:24.629 --> 01:40:24.639 align:start position:0%
representative pandolakis
 
01:40:28.629 --> 01:40:28.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:31.350 --> 01:40:31.360 align:start position:0%
in the past we've been told that
 
01:40:33.830 --> 01:40:33.840 align:start position:0%
uh these body cameras
 
01:40:36.629 --> 01:40:36.639 align:start position:0%
would cost our cities and towns
 
01:40:39.189 --> 01:40:39.199 align:start position:0%
a lot of money in the future for the
 
01:40:42.790 --> 01:40:42.800 align:start position:0%
cloud is that covered in any way
 
01:40:44.709 --> 01:40:44.719 align:start position:0%
uh yes thank you for the question the
 
01:40:47.669 --> 01:40:47.679 align:start position:0%
the cost of storage of the data in the
 
01:40:50.390 --> 01:40:50.400 align:start position:0%
video is covered by the grants it is a
 
01:40:52.709 --> 01:40:52.719 align:start position:0%
significant cost the the equipment is is
 
01:40:52.719 --> 01:40:54.070 align:start position:0%
significant cost the the equipment is is
actually

01:40:54.070 --> 01:40:54.080 align:start position:0%
actually
 
01:40:55.750 --> 01:40:55.760 align:start position:0%
a small component if you look at the
 
01:40:58.070 --> 01:40:58.080 align:start position:0%
entire program but this would fund the
 
01:41:00.390 --> 01:41:00.400 align:start position:0%
entire program equipment and also data
 
01:41:00.400 --> 01:41:01.590 align:start position:0%
entire program equipment and also data
storage

01:41:01.590 --> 01:41:01.600 align:start position:0%
storage
 
01:41:05.590 --> 01:41:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:07.750 --> 01:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
represent the muse
 
01:41:09.350 --> 01:41:09.360 align:start position:0%
yes just have some questions about the
 
01:41:12.149 --> 01:41:12.159 align:start position:0%
status of the of the program so
 
01:41:14.470 --> 01:41:14.480 align:start position:0%
there were 29 applicants i would assume
 
01:41:16.070 --> 01:41:16.080 align:start position:0%
that um
 
01:41:19.189 --> 01:41:19.199 align:start position:0%
there were 29 grants
 
01:41:21.590 --> 01:41:21.600 align:start position:0%
yes so there were 29 applicants
 
01:41:24.629 --> 01:41:24.639 align:start position:0%
each application was deemed eligible
 
01:41:27.510 --> 01:41:27.520 align:start position:0%
and has been funded in some way shape or
 
01:41:29.910 --> 01:41:29.920 align:start position:0%
form i'm not saying each component was
 
01:41:31.430 --> 01:41:31.440 align:start position:0%
fully funded there may have been a few
 
01:41:33.189 --> 01:41:33.199 align:start position:0%
individual elements that didn't meet the
 
01:41:35.189 --> 01:41:35.199 align:start position:0%
criteria but every applicant is
 
01:41:37.270 --> 01:41:37.280 align:start position:0%
receiving some level of funding those
 
01:41:39.350 --> 01:41:39.360 align:start position:0%
were approved by the commissioner of
 
01:41:41.510 --> 01:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
safety this week and we're moving
 
01:41:45.030 --> 01:41:45.040 align:start position:0%
forward with the grant app uh the grant
 
01:41:49.510 --> 01:41:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:51.109 --> 01:41:51.119 align:start position:0%
representative muse
 
01:41:54.629 --> 01:41:54.639 align:start position:0%
so so an additional question would be um
 
01:41:57.350 --> 01:41:57.360 align:start position:0%
it sounds like we're we're funding um
 
01:41:59.990 --> 01:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
body cams incrementally which means body
 
01:42:02.149 --> 01:42:02.159 align:start position:0%
cams are probably
 
01:42:04.149 --> 01:42:04.159 align:start position:0%
getting into patrol cars and onto
 
01:42:08.310 --> 01:42:08.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:11.510 --> 01:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
what percentage of new hampshire police
 
01:42:14.629 --> 01:42:14.639 align:start position:0%
officers at the 2300 that you uh that
 
01:42:17.669 --> 01:42:17.679 align:start position:0%
you that you referenced um do you think
 
01:42:21.109 --> 01:42:21.119 align:start position:0%
uh currently are equipped with uh with
 
01:42:23.910 --> 01:42:23.920 align:start position:0%
body cams and dash cams
 
01:42:26.310 --> 01:42:26.320 align:start position:0%
um i i don't have the percentage of the
 
01:42:29.270 --> 01:42:29.280 align:start position:0%
3 300
 
01:42:32.629 --> 01:42:32.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:34.550 --> 01:42:34.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:42:37.590 --> 01:42:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:39.350 --> 01:42:39.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
01:42:40.629 --> 01:42:40.639 align:start position:0%
my question
 
01:42:43.590 --> 01:42:43.600 align:start position:0%
uh would these uh
 
01:42:45.669 --> 01:42:45.679 align:start position:0%
cameras be used exclusively for law
 
01:42:48.149 --> 01:42:48.159 align:start position:0%
enforcement vehicles only
 
01:42:49.669 --> 01:42:49.679 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question it'd be
 
01:42:53.270 --> 01:42:53.280 align:start position:0%
law enforcement vehicles or body cameras
 
01:42:56.310 --> 01:42:56.320 align:start position:0%
uh both
 
01:42:58.550 --> 01:42:58.560 align:start position:0%
either or or both yes
 
01:43:02.470 --> 01:43:02.480 align:start position:0%
all the above okay thank you
 
01:43:02.480 --> 01:43:04.790 align:start position:0%
all the above okay thank you
representative

01:43:04.790 --> 01:43:04.800 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:43:06.310 --> 01:43:06.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
01:43:09.109 --> 01:43:09.119 align:start position:0%
if i understood you correctly uh
 
01:43:11.430 --> 01:43:11.440 align:start position:0%
the um
 
01:43:13.669 --> 01:43:13.679 align:start position:0%
the larger part of the
 
01:43:16.149 --> 01:43:16.159 align:start position:0%
uh grant was going to
 
01:43:18.390 --> 01:43:18.400 align:start position:0%
data storage then to the equipment
 
01:43:18.400 --> 01:43:20.070 align:start position:0%
data storage then to the equipment
itself

01:43:20.070 --> 01:43:20.080 align:start position:0%
itself
 
01:43:20.080 --> 01:43:20.950 align:start position:0%
itself
which

01:43:20.950 --> 01:43:20.960 align:start position:0%
which
 
01:43:23.189 --> 01:43:23.199 align:start position:0%
suggests to me that there's
 
01:43:25.270 --> 01:43:25.280 align:start position:0%
there is or would be a running cost for
 
01:43:28.229 --> 01:43:28.239 align:start position:0%
this over time could you with respect to
 
01:43:30.629 --> 01:43:30.639 align:start position:0%
that 20 million dollar figure that
 
01:43:32.470 --> 01:43:32.480 align:start position:0%
you've referred to what what part of
 
01:43:34.790 --> 01:43:34.800 align:start position:0%
that is a running cost that would be
 
01:43:38.390 --> 01:43:38.400 align:start position:0%
incurred each year
 
01:43:40.229 --> 01:43:40.239 align:start position:0%
so it varies there's i i don't have a
 
01:43:43.350 --> 01:43:43.360 align:start position:0%
good answer because each system is um is
 
01:43:47.030 --> 01:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
unique and and different um and if i can
 
01:43:48.950 --> 01:43:48.960 align:start position:0%
clarify about the difference between the
 
01:43:53.109 --> 01:43:53.119 align:start position:0%
equipment and the and the data costs
 
01:43:54.950 --> 01:43:54.960 align:start position:0%
each municipality
 
01:43:56.790 --> 01:43:56.800 align:start position:0%
may approach this in a different way
 
01:43:58.870 --> 01:43:58.880 align:start position:0%
some are looking at
 
01:44:00.310 --> 01:44:00.320 align:start position:0%
a leased option
 
01:44:02.950 --> 01:44:02.960 align:start position:0%
where the equipment is is leased the
 
01:44:07.109 --> 01:44:07.119 align:start position:0%
space is hosted for for data
 
01:44:09.270 --> 01:44:09.280 align:start position:0%
for data storage and and that's a
 
01:44:11.750 --> 01:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
monthly payment structure some may
 
01:44:14.149 --> 01:44:14.159 align:start position:0%
choose to purchase cameras outright uh
 
01:44:16.390 --> 01:44:16.400 align:start position:0%
purchase servers and store data locally
 
01:44:19.030 --> 01:44:19.040 align:start position:0%
uh so this this grant program allows the
 
01:44:21.270 --> 01:44:21.280 align:start position:0%
the local law enforcement entity to
 
01:44:24.229 --> 01:44:24.239 align:start position:0%
decide which model meets their needs
 
01:44:26.310 --> 01:44:26.320 align:start position:0%
the best so the answer really depends
 
01:44:28.790 --> 01:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
upon which direction they go in
 
01:44:31.830 --> 01:44:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:35.270 --> 01:44:35.280 align:start position:0%
data storage becomes the big uh ongoing
 
01:44:36.870 --> 01:44:36.880 align:start position:0%
question how long do you maintain the
 
01:44:40.390 --> 01:44:40.400 align:start position:0%
video how much space is required um and
 
01:44:42.390 --> 01:44:42.400 align:start position:0%
and that's an ongoing cost if you
 
01:44:44.070 --> 01:44:44.080 align:start position:0%
purchase the equipment you'll need to
 
01:44:45.669 --> 01:44:45.679 align:start position:0%
replace that maybe every three to five
 
01:44:47.830 --> 01:44:47.840 align:start position:0%
years based on
 
01:44:49.270 --> 01:44:49.280 align:start position:0%
based on other other technol
 
01:44:51.590 --> 01:44:51.600 align:start position:0%
technological equipment replacements
 
01:44:53.270 --> 01:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
but your storage costs will continue
 
01:45:00.629 --> 01:45:00.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:02.470 --> 01:45:02.480 align:start position:0%
i see no hands raised i want to thank
 
01:45:06.390 --> 01:45:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:10.310 --> 01:45:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:44.790 --> 01:45:44.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:46.310 --> 01:45:46.320 align:start position:0%
all right i think that's right good
 
01:45:47.990 --> 01:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
morning mr chair members of the
 
01:45:50.070 --> 01:45:50.080 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is
 
01:45:52.550 --> 01:45:52.560 align:start position:0%
david rodrigue director of operations
 
01:45:54.790 --> 01:45:54.800 align:start position:0%
for the department of transportation
 
01:45:56.870 --> 01:45:56.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for hearing my testimony this
 
01:45:59.910 --> 01:45:59.920 align:start position:0%
morning i also want to thank senator d
 
01:46:02.790 --> 01:46:02.800 align:start position:0%
alessandro and senator morse for the
 
01:46:04.790 --> 01:46:04.800 align:start position:0%
amendment to 401
 
01:46:09.990 --> 01:46:10.000 align:start position:0%
um that amends rsa 236 130. so if you
 
01:46:14.390 --> 01:46:14.400 align:start position:0%
look at the bill there is a a section 4
 
01:46:17.350 --> 01:46:17.360 align:start position:0%
amending highway surveillance prohibited
 
01:46:21.350 --> 01:46:21.360 align:start position:0%
exception for dax dash cams and and new
 
01:46:25.030 --> 01:46:25.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire d.o.t fleet vehicles
 
01:46:29.590 --> 01:46:29.600 align:start position:0%
rsa 236 130 prohibits video surveillance
 
01:46:31.830 --> 01:46:31.840 align:start position:0%
and as written prevents the department
 
01:46:35.030 --> 01:46:35.040 align:start position:0%
from installing a dashboard camera in
 
01:46:37.270 --> 01:46:37.280 align:start position:0%
any of our vehicles and recording that
 
01:46:39.669 --> 01:46:39.679 align:start position:0%
image this amendment will allow the
 
01:46:42.149 --> 01:46:42.159 align:start position:0%
department to install the cameras to
 
01:46:44.870 --> 01:46:44.880 align:start position:0%
record the video and to store the video
 
01:46:47.270 --> 01:46:47.280 align:start position:0%
for three days the amendment allows
 
01:46:50.149 --> 01:46:50.159 align:start position:0%
storage of particular video for longer
 
01:46:52.470 --> 01:46:52.480 align:start position:0%
than three days if requested by the
 
01:46:54.790 --> 01:46:54.800 align:start position:0%
department of transportation or another
 
01:46:56.950 --> 01:46:56.960 align:start position:0%
legal entity
 
01:46:59.910 --> 01:46:59.920 align:start position:0%
dash cam video and retention of selected
 
01:47:01.990 --> 01:47:02.000 align:start position:0%
segments is important to the department
 
01:47:04.149 --> 01:47:04.159 align:start position:0%
of transportation as well as new
 
01:47:06.950 --> 01:47:06.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire citizens and visitors in that
 
01:47:09.669 --> 01:47:09.679 align:start position:0%
it will allow us to better manage an
 
01:47:12.070 --> 01:47:12.080 align:start position:0%
incident with the person in the vehicle
 
01:47:14.070 --> 01:47:14.080 align:start position:0%
threatening or causing harm to our
 
01:47:16.950 --> 01:47:16.960 align:start position:0%

01:47:27.990 --> 01:47:28.000 align:start position:0%
we are assisting dot internal training
 
01:47:29.990 --> 01:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
assuring we are assisting the vehicle
 
01:47:31.590 --> 01:47:31.600 align:start position:0%
per protocol
 
01:47:33.430 --> 01:47:33.440 align:start position:0%
we will use it for public safety
 
01:47:36.229 --> 01:47:36.239 align:start position:0%
campaigns to urge drivers to slow down
 
01:47:40.950 --> 01:47:40.960 align:start position:0%
and move over as required in rsa 230 265
 
01:47:40.960 --> 01:47:42.550 align:start position:0%

37a
 
01:47:45.350 --> 01:47:45.360 align:start position:0%
and a future goal um would be to have
 
01:47:47.590 --> 01:47:47.600 align:start position:0%
the video link to our transportation
 
01:47:50.390 --> 01:47:50.400 align:start position:0%
management center video wall so we can
 
01:47:52.709 --> 01:47:52.719 align:start position:0%
keep an eye on our service patrol folks
 
01:47:54.149 --> 01:47:54.159 align:start position:0%
who are out there
 
01:47:57.270 --> 01:47:57.280 align:start position:0%
alone in dangerous circumstances
 
01:47:59.590 --> 01:47:59.600 align:start position:0%
i've distributed several pictures of
 
01:48:02.229 --> 01:48:02.239 align:start position:0%
damage to service patrol vehicles caused
 
01:48:05.189 --> 01:48:05.199 align:start position:0%
by drivers who have refused to slow down
 
01:48:07.109 --> 01:48:07.119 align:start position:0%
and move over when approaching our
 
01:48:09.430 --> 01:48:09.440 align:start position:0%
vehicles believe it or not there have
 
01:48:11.109 --> 01:48:11.119 align:start position:0%
been motorists that have hit our
 
01:48:14.310 --> 01:48:14.320 align:start position:0%
vehicles or people and continued to
 
01:48:16.470 --> 01:48:16.480 align:start position:0%
travel without stopping
 
01:48:18.470 --> 01:48:18.480 align:start position:0%
one of these times occurred a year or
 
01:48:20.629 --> 01:48:20.639 align:start position:0%
two ago when one of our patrol foreman
 
01:48:22.629 --> 01:48:22.639 align:start position:0%
was struck by a vehicle when removing
 
01:48:25.510 --> 01:48:25.520 align:start position:0%
debris from the roadway fortunately he
 
01:48:28.390 --> 01:48:28.400 align:start position:0%
was able on his own to call for help
 
01:48:31.189 --> 01:48:31.199 align:start position:0%
you may have seen the video recently on
 
01:48:34.149 --> 01:48:34.159 align:start position:0%
channel 9 of a strike of one of our
 
01:48:37.990 --> 01:48:38.000 align:start position:0%
service patrol vehicles on march 11 2022
 
01:48:41.430 --> 01:48:41.440 align:start position:0%
on wmur we are thankful that our driver
 
01:48:44.149 --> 01:48:44.159 align:start position:0%
and the tow truck operators working on a
 
01:48:46.149 --> 01:48:46.159 align:start position:0%
broken down vehicle in front of our
 
01:48:49.189 --> 01:48:49.199 align:start position:0%
driver was unharmed in addition to the
 
01:48:51.990 --> 01:48:52.000 align:start position:0%
many flashing amber lights this vehicle
 
01:48:54.229 --> 01:48:54.239 align:start position:0%
was also equipped and had deployed a
 
01:48:56.709 --> 01:48:56.719 align:start position:0%
large message sign on the back of the
 
01:48:56.719 --> 01:48:57.830 align:start position:0%

thank you for your consideration of this
 
01:49:02.310 --> 01:49:02.320 align:start position:0%
amendment and i am hopeful you will pass
 
01:49:04.950 --> 01:49:04.960 align:start position:0%
the bill to allow the use of dashboard
 
01:49:07.590 --> 01:49:07.600 align:start position:0%
cameras as a tool to better protect our
 
01:49:10.310 --> 01:49:10.320 align:start position:0%

hello i'm over here
 
01:49:21.910 --> 01:49:21.920 align:start position:0%
um on the bridge money does that have to
 
01:49:24.310 --> 01:49:24.320 align:start position:0%
go through the 10-year plan or would
 
01:49:27.430 --> 01:49:27.440 align:start position:0%
just be uh expedient
 
01:49:29.830 --> 01:49:29.840 align:start position:0%
so the bridge money would not have to go
 
01:49:31.910 --> 01:49:31.920 align:start position:0%
through the 10-year plan that would be
 
01:49:34.470 --> 01:49:34.480 align:start position:0%
money that will be available to the
 
01:49:36.950 --> 01:49:36.960 align:start position:0%
towns and communities as once the bill
 
01:49:40.229 --> 01:49:40.239 align:start position:0%
is is passed through the regular um
 
01:49:42.709 --> 01:49:42.719 align:start position:0%
bridge program state bridge aid program
 
01:49:46.870 --> 01:49:46.880 align:start position:0%

uh thank you mr chairman thank you mr
 
01:49:52.390 --> 01:49:52.400 align:start position:0%
rodriguez it's a little unusual to have
 
01:49:53.830 --> 01:49:53.840 align:start position:0%
highway funding coming through this can
 
01:49:55.430 --> 01:49:55.440 align:start position:0%
you educate the committee a little bit
 
01:49:57.590 --> 01:49:57.600 align:start position:0%
about how many bridges could be
 
01:49:59.830 --> 01:49:59.840 align:start position:0%
accelerated with this money and how many
 
01:50:02.790 --> 01:50:02.800 align:start position:0%
miles of municipal road could be
 
01:50:05.510 --> 01:50:05.520 align:start position:0%
could be uh repaired with this
 
01:50:06.870 --> 01:50:06.880 align:start position:0%
right so
 
01:50:10.550 --> 01:50:10.560 align:start position:0%
um please forgive me i'm not here fully
 
01:50:13.990 --> 01:50:14.000 align:start position:0%
educated and able to to speak on the
 
01:50:16.390 --> 01:50:16.400 align:start position:0%
bridge aid or the block grant aid
 
01:50:19.750 --> 01:50:19.760 align:start position:0%
funding i am more here to support the
 
01:50:22.709 --> 01:50:22.719 align:start position:0%
the amendment so any estimation i would
 
01:50:28.310 --> 01:50:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:30.950 --> 01:50:30.960 align:start position:0%
representative marston
 
01:50:33.109 --> 01:50:33.119 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:50:35.030 --> 01:50:35.040 align:start position:0%
your testimony
 
01:50:37.590 --> 01:50:37.600 align:start position:0%
listening to your testimony i came up
 
01:50:39.590 --> 01:50:39.600 align:start position:0%
with this question has there been
 
01:50:43.189 --> 01:50:43.199 align:start position:0%
opposition to cameras being within your
 
01:50:43.199 --> 01:50:45.830 align:start position:0%
opposition to cameras being within your
department

01:50:45.830 --> 01:50:45.840 align:start position:0%
department
 
01:50:48.550 --> 01:50:48.560 align:start position:0%
there certainly were some privacy
 
01:50:51.270 --> 01:50:51.280 align:start position:0%
concerns particularly as we deployed
 
01:50:53.189 --> 01:50:53.199 align:start position:0%
what we call our intelligent
 
01:50:55.189 --> 01:50:55.199 align:start position:0%
transportation system
 
01:50:58.149 --> 01:50:58.159 align:start position:0%
which includes cameras on high mass
 
01:51:01.669 --> 01:51:01.679 align:start position:0%
poles on the interstate and so forth and
 
01:51:04.709 --> 01:51:04.719 align:start position:0%
also as we deployed cameras through our
 
01:51:08.790 --> 01:51:08.800 align:start position:0%
toll system um for for tow enforcement
 
01:51:11.750 --> 01:51:11.760 align:start position:0%
um there were some privacy concerns that
 
01:51:15.430 --> 01:51:15.440 align:start position:0%
those devices could be used to surveil
 
01:51:17.830 --> 01:51:17.840 align:start position:0%
individuals and there's there's
 
01:51:21.990 --> 01:51:22.000 align:start position:0%
recording um prohibition prohibitions to
 
01:51:25.109 --> 01:51:25.119 align:start position:0%
protect against that in which exceptions
 
01:51:27.109 --> 01:51:27.119 align:start position:0%
have been made for the department when
 
01:51:29.270 --> 01:51:29.280 align:start position:0%
it's necessary for the department's
 
01:51:29.280 --> 01:51:33.750 align:start position:0%
it's necessary for the department's
operations

01:51:33.750 --> 01:51:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:36.629 --> 01:51:36.639 align:start position:0%
you're recognized representative
 
01:51:39.669 --> 01:51:39.679 align:start position:0%
in regards to that
 
01:51:42.070 --> 01:51:42.080 align:start position:0%
who was the opposition somebody such as
 
01:51:44.950 --> 01:51:44.960 align:start position:0%
the aclu or others
 
01:51:48.790 --> 01:51:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:51.030 --> 01:51:51.040 align:start position:0%
in fairness to the witness
 
01:51:52.550 --> 01:51:52.560 align:start position:0%
he should it's probably fair for the
 
01:51:54.470 --> 01:51:54.480 align:start position:0%
witness to testify on his own behalf or
 
01:51:55.830 --> 01:51:55.840 align:start position:0%
on behalf of whatever organization he's
 
01:51:59.030 --> 01:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
here for not he's not here on behalf of
 
01:52:00.709 --> 01:52:00.719 align:start position:0%
the aclu or
 
01:52:02.790 --> 01:52:02.800 align:start position:0%
so i would
 
01:52:07.910 --> 01:52:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:09.830 --> 01:52:09.840 align:start position:0%
representative bert
 
01:52:11.510 --> 01:52:11.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:52:13.270 --> 01:52:13.280 align:start position:0%
um you know i guess that's what i'm
 
01:52:15.350 --> 01:52:15.360 align:start position:0%
looking at is the privacy part now for
 
01:52:18.790 --> 01:52:18.800 align:start position:0%
the three days that you have this video
 
01:52:21.430 --> 01:52:21.440 align:start position:0%
could it be downloaded to another
 
01:52:24.629 --> 01:52:24.639 align:start position:0%
server and then you scrub it but it will
 
01:52:27.750 --> 01:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
be out there forever
 
01:52:30.790 --> 01:52:30.800 align:start position:0%
you know on this other server
 
01:52:32.390 --> 01:52:32.400 align:start position:0%
so could somebody
 
01:52:35.430 --> 01:52:35.440 align:start position:0%
maliciously nefariously record the video
 
01:52:38.709 --> 01:52:38.719 align:start position:0%
on another device and keep keep that no
 
01:52:40.310 --> 01:52:40.320 align:start position:0%
would could you
 
01:52:42.149 --> 01:52:42.159 align:start position:0%
could your department okay i'm assuming
 
01:52:44.870 --> 01:52:44.880 align:start position:0%
the the right
 
01:52:47.669 --> 01:52:47.679 align:start position:0%
for the three days it's somewhat secure
 
01:52:50.629 --> 01:52:50.639 align:start position:0%
i mean of course hacks can get in right
 
01:52:52.390 --> 01:52:52.400 align:start position:0%
so it's going to be secure for three
 
01:52:54.950 --> 01:52:54.960 align:start position:0%
days but then it has to be deleted
 
01:52:54.960 --> 01:52:56.229 align:start position:0%
days but then it has to be deleted
right

01:52:56.229 --> 01:52:56.239 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:52:59.350 --> 01:52:59.360 align:start position:0%
in between those three days could you or
 
01:53:01.910 --> 01:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
the police or some government agency
 
01:53:04.070 --> 01:53:04.080 align:start position:0%
grab that and say you know what you'll
 
01:53:06.229 --> 01:53:06.239 align:start position:0%
delete it eventually but we're gonna
 
01:53:08.950 --> 01:53:08.960 align:start position:0%
store it over here yes we could yes we
 
01:53:12.070 --> 01:53:12.080 align:start position:0%
could and that permission is is written
 
01:53:15.109 --> 01:53:15.119 align:start position:0%
into the wording so if we were to
 
01:53:16.870 --> 01:53:16.880 align:start position:0%
have some video
 
01:53:19.109 --> 01:53:19.119 align:start position:0%
for instance that showed a hit-and-run
 
01:53:21.589 --> 01:53:21.599 align:start position:0%
vehicle in which we could identify that
 
01:53:24.310 --> 01:53:24.320 align:start position:0%
vehicle we would definitely turn that
 
01:53:26.629 --> 01:53:26.639 align:start position:0%
over to to police
 
01:53:29.030 --> 01:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
if we had other video that would be
 
01:53:31.669 --> 01:53:31.679 align:start position:0%
valuable for our training of other
 
01:53:34.310 --> 01:53:34.320 align:start position:0%
employees for how to park on the
 
01:53:37.350 --> 01:53:37.360 align:start position:0%
shoulder and and so forth we would save
 
01:53:40.470 --> 01:53:40.480 align:start position:0%
that as well being very careful because
 
01:53:42.790 --> 01:53:42.800 align:start position:0%
we are we do understand the privacy
 
01:53:46.229 --> 01:53:46.239 align:start position:0%
concerns being very careful not to
 
01:53:46.239 --> 01:53:47.270 align:start position:0%
concerns being very careful not to
um

01:53:47.270 --> 01:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:50.629 --> 01:53:50.639 align:start position:0%
provide any information that that would
 
01:53:54.390 --> 01:53:54.400 align:start position:0%
um violate that but in in it i can
 
01:53:56.470 --> 01:53:56.480 align:start position:0%
assure you in no way
 
01:53:59.669 --> 01:53:59.679 align:start position:0%
would this video be of such a quality
 
01:54:02.870 --> 01:54:02.880 align:start position:0%
and such a use to keep track of where
 
01:54:05.270 --> 01:54:05.280 align:start position:0%
people are traveling on uh on our
 
01:54:05.280 --> 01:54:06.870 align:start position:0%
people are traveling on uh on our
highway

01:54:06.870 --> 01:54:06.880 align:start position:0%
highway
 
01:54:11.030 --> 01:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:14.390 --> 01:54:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:16.070 --> 01:54:16.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for thank you for sharing
 
01:54:17.270 --> 01:54:17.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question do you
 
01:54:19.589 --> 01:54:19.599 align:start position:0%
also like you have other incidents with
 
01:54:21.669 --> 01:54:21.679 align:start position:0%
let's say snowplows or things like that
 
01:54:23.510 --> 01:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
where it comes to you know
 
01:54:25.830 --> 01:54:25.840 align:start position:0%
where we have accidents and how handy
 
01:54:27.510 --> 01:54:27.520 align:start position:0%
would it be with you know to have these
 
01:54:29.030 --> 01:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
dash cams
 
01:54:32.070 --> 01:54:32.080 align:start position:0%
we do have those those instances and
 
01:54:35.030 --> 01:54:35.040 align:start position:0%
it's quite common for many states around
 
01:54:37.430 --> 01:54:37.440 align:start position:0%
the country that do not have the same
 
01:54:39.910 --> 01:54:39.920 align:start position:0%
unique privacy concerns as new hampshire
 
01:54:43.510 --> 01:54:43.520 align:start position:0%
has at some times to use dash cams in
 
01:54:46.470 --> 01:54:46.480 align:start position:0%
those videos they then put those to a
 
01:54:48.709 --> 01:54:48.719 align:start position:0%
public website where the public can
 
01:54:51.669 --> 01:54:51.679 align:start position:0%
actually log in see where the snow plow
 
01:54:54.790 --> 01:54:54.800 align:start position:0%
is and see what they see as
 
01:54:56.470 --> 01:54:56.480 align:start position:0%
as they're treating
 
01:54:58.550 --> 01:54:58.560 align:start position:0%
the roadway people find that quite
 
01:55:00.709 --> 01:55:00.719 align:start position:0%
helpful for for road condition
 
01:55:03.430 --> 01:55:03.440 align:start position:0%
information and and so forth and i
 
01:55:05.990 --> 01:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
assure you that they are not violating
 
01:55:08.229 --> 01:55:08.239 align:start position:0%
privacy when they're when they're doing
 
01:55:16.830 --> 01:55:16.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:19.189 --> 01:55:19.199 align:start position:0%
quality right seeing no hands raised i
 
01:55:20.070 --> 01:55:20.080 align:start position:0%
want to thank the witness for his
 
01:55:20.080 --> 01:55:21.669 align:start position:0%
want to thank the witness for his
testimony

01:55:21.669 --> 01:55:21.679 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:55:32.470 --> 01:55:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:34.149 --> 01:55:34.159 align:start position:0%
are there any members of the public who
 
01:55:36.229 --> 01:55:36.239 align:start position:0%
wish to testify that have haven't
 
01:55:37.910 --> 01:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
testified already or if you have
 
01:55:39.830 --> 01:55:39.840 align:start position:0%
testified already and wish to speak to
 
01:55:48.709 --> 01:55:48.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:50.390 --> 01:55:50.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and member of the
 
01:55:51.990 --> 01:55:52.000 align:start position:0%
committee for offering me the
 
01:55:53.589 --> 01:55:53.599 align:start position:0%
flexibility and the opportunity to
 
01:55:55.510 --> 01:55:55.520 align:start position:0%
review the amendment um that was
 
01:55:57.750 --> 01:55:57.760 align:start position:0%
presented to you all so
 
01:55:59.750 --> 01:55:59.760 align:start position:0%
the amendment as presented is very
 
01:56:01.510 --> 01:56:01.520 align:start position:0%
similar to the language that we are
 
01:56:03.510 --> 01:56:03.520 align:start position:0%
presenting i did want to point out a
 
01:56:06.229 --> 01:56:06.239 align:start position:0%
very minor technicality on line 9 and 18
 
01:56:08.149 --> 01:56:08.159 align:start position:0%
it uses the word town rather than
 
01:56:10.629 --> 01:56:10.639 align:start position:0%
political subdivision and town is not a
 
01:56:13.189 --> 01:56:13.199 align:start position:0%
legally defined term in the rsa so we
 
01:56:16.470 --> 01:56:16.480 align:start position:0%
just would like to be very clear
 
01:56:16.480 --> 01:56:17.350 align:start position:0%
just would like to be very clear
and

01:56:17.350 --> 01:56:17.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:56:18.870 --> 01:56:18.880 align:start position:0%
section three
 
01:56:21.669 --> 01:56:21.679 align:start position:0%
of the body cam is not addressed
 
01:56:24.070 --> 01:56:24.080 align:start position:0%
in this amendment and we would just ask
 
01:56:26.149 --> 01:56:26.159 align:start position:0%
that the language that we provided were
 
01:56:26.159 --> 01:56:27.270 align:start position:0%
that the language that we provided were
similar

01:56:27.270 --> 01:56:27.280 align:start position:0%
similar
 
01:56:29.910 --> 01:56:29.920 align:start position:0%
be added so that towns who wish and
 
01:56:32.070 --> 01:56:32.080 align:start position:0%
municipalities political subdivisions
 
01:56:34.870 --> 01:56:34.880 align:start position:0%
who wish to apply for these funds again
 
01:56:37.430 --> 01:56:37.440 align:start position:0%
prior to um if they're
 
01:56:39.270 --> 01:56:39.280 align:start position:0%
available in 2022 they have the
 
01:56:41.109 --> 01:56:41.119 align:start position:0%
opportunity to apply for these funds if
 
01:56:42.950 --> 01:56:42.960 align:start position:0%
they have not adopted the provisions of
 
01:56:42.960 --> 01:56:44.950 align:start position:0%
they have not adopted the provisions of
3195b

01:56:44.950 --> 01:56:44.960 align:start position:0%
3195b
 
01:56:46.790 --> 01:56:46.800 align:start position:0%
and we did put in there that this
 
01:56:49.750 --> 01:56:49.760 align:start position:0%
provision would expire in fiscal year at
 
01:56:52.390 --> 01:56:52.400 align:start position:0%
the end of fiscal year 2023 so on june
 
01:56:55.109 --> 01:56:55.119 align:start position:0%
30th of 2023 giving towns the
 
01:56:57.510 --> 01:56:57.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity to then plan differently if
 
01:56:59.669 --> 01:56:59.679 align:start position:0%
they wish to apply for these funds so we
 
01:57:01.990 --> 01:57:02.000 align:start position:0%
ask for that one year opportunity that
 
01:57:04.950 --> 01:57:04.960 align:start position:0%
if communities would like this
 
01:57:06.629 --> 01:57:06.639 align:start position:0%
to apply for this fifty thousand dollar
 
01:57:08.310 --> 01:57:08.320 align:start position:0%
grant that they may have the opportunity
 
01:57:12.470 --> 01:57:12.480 align:start position:0%
to do so in the next 18 months
 
01:57:14.950 --> 01:57:14.960 align:start position:0%
if it pleases the chair i could answer a
 
01:57:17.109 --> 01:57:17.119 align:start position:0%
previous question or provide some
 
01:57:20.310 --> 01:57:20.320 align:start position:0%
information about town
 
01:57:22.390 --> 01:57:22.400 align:start position:0%
bridges and aid
 
01:57:24.790 --> 01:57:24.800 align:start position:0%
that was asked earlier may speak freely
 
01:57:27.750 --> 01:57:27.760 align:start position:0%
thank you so currently we have a list
 
01:57:29.589 --> 01:57:29.599 align:start position:0%
created by the state of our red listed
 
01:57:31.109 --> 01:57:31.119 align:start position:0%
bridges i'd be happy to email the
 
01:57:32.629 --> 01:57:32.639 align:start position:0%
committee that list
 
01:57:34.950 --> 01:57:34.960 align:start position:0%
we have 6.8 million dollars in this
 
01:57:37.589 --> 01:57:37.599 align:start position:0%
biennium budget per year for the next
 
01:57:40.229 --> 01:57:40.239 align:start position:0%
two years to help assist the communities
 
01:57:42.709 --> 01:57:42.719 align:start position:0%
with these red listed bridges there is a
 
01:57:45.430 --> 01:57:45.440 align:start position:0%
a small match program
 
01:57:48.629 --> 01:57:48.639 align:start position:0%
what this bill does is give 425 percent
 
01:57:51.589 --> 01:57:51.599 align:start position:0%
more to that program and each bridge of
 
01:57:52.950 --> 01:57:52.960 align:start position:0%
course is going to cost a different
 
01:57:54.709 --> 01:57:54.719 align:start position:0%
amount of money so how far along the
 
01:57:56.149 --> 01:57:56.159 align:start position:0%
list they would get
 
01:57:57.830 --> 01:57:57.840 align:start position:0%
is going to be determined on the size of
 
01:57:59.510 --> 01:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
each project but i can certainly send
 
01:58:00.870 --> 01:58:00.880 align:start position:0%
you the list of
 
01:58:02.950 --> 01:58:02.960 align:start position:0%
approximate over 100 bridges that are on
 
01:58:06.149 --> 01:58:06.159 align:start position:0%
this red list as of 2022 and in the
 
01:58:08.470 --> 01:58:08.480 align:start position:0%
highway block grant funds in this
 
01:58:11.270 --> 01:58:11.280 align:start position:0%
biennium budget we have 34 million
 
01:58:13.830 --> 01:58:13.840 align:start position:0%
dollars per year allocated to towns
 
01:58:16.550 --> 01:58:16.560 align:start position:0%
based on partly their population as per
 
01:58:18.709 --> 01:58:18.719 align:start position:0%
against the state population and miles
 
01:58:21.750 --> 01:58:21.760 align:start position:0%
of road class four and five road in
 
01:58:23.589 --> 01:58:23.599 align:start position:0%
their community and that's how the funds
 
01:58:25.270 --> 01:58:25.280 align:start position:0%
are apportioned and i'd be happy to also
 
01:58:26.709 --> 01:58:26.719 align:start position:0%
send you the schedule so you can see
 
01:58:28.629 --> 01:58:28.639 align:start position:0%
what each community gets in dollars if
 
01:58:45.750 --> 01:58:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:47.270 --> 01:58:47.280 align:start position:0%

01:58:50.709 --> 01:58:50.719 align:start position:0%
uh i have a question uh that you were
 
01:58:51.990 --> 01:58:52.000 align:start position:0%
talking about the highway block grant
 
01:58:53.669 --> 01:58:53.679 align:start position:0%
and that information is available is
 
01:58:55.189 --> 01:58:55.199 align:start position:0%
that available online or is that
 
01:58:56.950 --> 01:58:56.960 align:start position:0%
something you'd send out it is also
 
01:58:59.750 --> 01:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
available online on the dot website um
 
01:59:02.229 --> 01:59:02.239 align:start position:0%
it does take a little bit of
 
01:59:03.589 --> 01:59:03.599 align:start position:0%
clicking to get there that's why i'm
 
01:59:04.709 --> 01:59:04.719 align:start position:0%
happy to just provide it to the
 
01:59:06.070 --> 01:59:06.080 align:start position:0%
committee if it's the pleasure of the
 
01:59:06.080 --> 01:59:07.510 align:start position:0%
committee if it's the pleasure of the
chair

01:59:07.510 --> 01:59:07.520 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:59:09.350 --> 01:59:09.360 align:start position:0%
as well as the red listed bridges that's
 
01:59:11.109 --> 01:59:11.119 align:start position:0%
also available online these are public
 
01:59:11.119 --> 01:59:13.350 align:start position:0%
also available online these are public
documents

01:59:13.350 --> 01:59:13.360 align:start position:0%
documents
 
01:59:16.950 --> 01:59:16.960 align:start position:0%
i think that'd be very helpful thank you
 
01:59:19.030 --> 01:59:19.040 align:start position:0%
representative rory
 
01:59:20.149 --> 01:59:20.159 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:59:22.629 --> 01:59:22.639 align:start position:0%
up here sorry that's okay
 
01:59:23.990 --> 01:59:24.000 align:start position:0%
if you're aware
 
01:59:25.910 --> 01:59:25.920 align:start position:0%
does the state provide a grant program
 
01:59:30.310 --> 01:59:30.320 align:start position:0%
to municipalities for body armor
 
01:59:32.550 --> 01:59:32.560 align:start position:0%
i am not as well versus i should be in
 
01:59:35.030 --> 01:59:35.040 align:start position:0%
all um public safety and criminal
 
01:59:37.270 --> 01:59:37.280 align:start position:0%
justice grants i there have been at
 
01:59:39.589 --> 01:59:39.599 align:start position:0%
different times and do you mean bullet
 
01:59:41.669 --> 01:59:41.679 align:start position:0%
proof that yes that's what i mean um i
 
01:59:43.669 --> 01:59:43.679 align:start position:0%
do my no my own police department at
 
01:59:45.189 --> 01:59:45.199 align:start position:0%
different times has received grant
 
01:59:46.950 --> 01:59:46.960 align:start position:0%
funding for those types of things but i
 
01:59:48.229 --> 01:59:48.239 align:start position:0%
think there's people in the audience
 
01:59:50.790 --> 01:59:50.800 align:start position:0%
that might be better versed to speak to
 
01:59:57.669 --> 01:59:57.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:59.750 --> 01:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
representative bert
 
02:00:01.510 --> 02:00:01.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
02:00:03.189 --> 02:00:03.199 align:start position:0%
when you send the
 
02:00:06.629 --> 02:00:06.639 align:start position:0%
list of the red listed bridges
 
02:00:09.830 --> 02:00:09.840 align:start position:0%
is there any way you could
 
02:00:09.840 --> 02:00:11.510 align:start position:0%
is there any way you could
separate

02:00:11.510 --> 02:00:11.520 align:start position:0%
separate
 
02:00:12.950 --> 02:00:12.960 align:start position:0%
you know i'm trying to think how to word
 
02:00:12.960 --> 02:00:14.470 align:start position:0%
you know i'm trying to think how to word
it

02:00:14.470 --> 02:00:14.480 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:00:16.470 --> 02:00:16.480 align:start position:0%
what is really ready to fall into the
 
02:00:19.990 --> 02:00:20.000 align:start position:0%
river and then also what is
 
02:00:22.310 --> 02:00:22.320 align:start position:0%
just out of compliance with today's
 
02:00:25.510 --> 02:00:25.520 align:start position:0%
standards because i remember the town i
 
02:00:27.669 --> 02:00:27.679 align:start position:0%
grew up in in vermont they had these two
 
02:00:30.470 --> 02:00:30.480 align:start position:0%
bridges for red listed
 
02:00:32.550 --> 02:00:32.560 align:start position:0%
a flood came through
 
02:00:34.149 --> 02:00:34.159 align:start position:0%
moved him a couple inches but when the
 
02:00:37.270 --> 02:00:37.280 align:start position:0%
guys showed up to take them down
 
02:00:38.790 --> 02:00:38.800 align:start position:0%
they said these bridges would have
 
02:00:40.310 --> 02:00:40.320 align:start position:0%
lasted another hundred years because
 
02:00:42.550 --> 02:00:42.560 align:start position:0%
they didn't come down
 
02:00:43.990 --> 02:00:44.000 align:start position:0%
so i was just wondering but they were on
 
02:00:45.750 --> 02:00:45.760 align:start position:0%
the red list so is there any way to but
 
02:00:47.350 --> 02:00:47.360 align:start position:0%
they weren't in compliance with today's
 
02:00:49.669 --> 02:00:49.679 align:start position:0%
standards is there a way to do that so
 
02:00:49.679 --> 02:00:50.470 align:start position:0%
standards is there a way to do that so
um

02:00:50.470 --> 02:00:50.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:52.390 --> 02:00:52.400 align:start position:0%
i'm with the municipal association and
 
02:00:55.189 --> 02:00:55.199 align:start position:0%
the dot and their engineers do a great
 
02:00:57.350 --> 02:00:57.360 align:start position:0%
job of going around and determining
 
02:00:59.910 --> 02:00:59.920 align:start position:0%
priority need and bridges are get
 
02:01:02.550 --> 02:01:02.560 align:start position:0%
allocated funds based on priority need
 
02:01:04.629 --> 02:01:04.639 align:start position:0%
and the list i'll send you will indicate
 
02:01:07.030 --> 02:01:07.040 align:start position:0%
that but that is out of our scope to be
 
02:01:08.550 --> 02:01:08.560 align:start position:0%
able to determine
 
02:01:10.310 --> 02:01:10.320 align:start position:0%
who would get funding first that that's
 
02:01:11.350 --> 02:01:11.360 align:start position:0%
a state
 
02:01:13.510 --> 02:01:13.520 align:start position:0%
in the state jurisdiction
 
02:01:18.629 --> 02:01:18.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:21.030 --> 02:01:21.040 align:start position:0%
representative uh thank you mr chairman
 
02:01:23.750 --> 02:01:23.760 align:start position:0%
uh would you agree with me that that a
 
02:01:25.109 --> 02:01:25.119 align:start position:0%
redless bridge
 
02:01:27.189 --> 02:01:27.199 align:start position:0%
can no longer simply be functionally
 
02:01:29.430 --> 02:01:29.440 align:start position:0%
obsolete as the representative from
 
02:01:32.390 --> 02:01:32.400 align:start position:0%
goffstown referred to but it has to be
 
02:01:34.550 --> 02:01:34.560 align:start position:0%
it has to be structurally deficient as
 
02:01:37.430 --> 02:01:37.440 align:start position:0%
well in at least one axis
 
02:01:40.070 --> 02:01:40.080 align:start position:0%
that is my my personal understanding of
 
02:01:41.910 --> 02:01:41.920 align:start position:0%
how the process works sir but i am not
 
02:01:46.950 --> 02:01:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:48.229 --> 02:01:48.239 align:start position:0%
seeing no hands raised i want to thank
 
02:01:49.830 --> 02:01:49.840 align:start position:0%

02:01:59.109 --> 02:01:59.119 align:start position:0%
are there any members of the public who
 
02:02:01.109 --> 02:02:01.119 align:start position:0%
wish to testify that have not testified
 
02:02:01.119 --> 02:02:05.669 align:start position:0%
wish to testify that have not testified

02:02:05.669 --> 02:02:05.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:07.430 --> 02:02:07.440 align:start position:0%
seeing no hands raised at this time we
 
02:02:09.589 --> 02:02:09.599 align:start position:0%
will now close the public hearing on
 
02:02:13.109 --> 02:02:13.119 align:start position:0%
senate bill 401
 
02:02:13.119 --> 02:02:19.510 align:start position:0%
senate bill 401
we'll

02:02:19.510 --> 02:02:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:19.520 --> 02:02:21.589 align:start position:0%
 
uh

02:02:21.589 --> 02:02:21.599 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:02:23.189 --> 02:02:23.199 align:start position:0%
yeah if
 
02:02:25.109 --> 02:02:25.119 align:start position:0%
the next public hearing schedule for 11
 
02:02:25.119 --> 02:02:27.030 align:start position:0%
the next public hearing schedule for 11
15

02:02:27.030 --> 02:02:27.040 align:start position:0%
15
 
02:02:28.470 --> 02:02:28.480 align:start position:0%
i uh
 
02:02:30.870 --> 02:02:30.880 align:start position:0%
if i can just address the committee i
 
02:02:33.430 --> 02:02:33.440 align:start position:0%
i know last i didn't do this the last
 
02:02:35.189 --> 02:02:35.199 align:start position:0%
time we were scheduled to be here
 
02:02:37.830 --> 02:02:37.840 align:start position:0%
but prior to that hearing that
 
02:02:39.350 --> 02:02:39.360 align:start position:0%
we had the passing of
 
02:02:41.510 --> 02:02:41.520 align:start position:0%
the former chair of this committee
 
02:02:43.350 --> 02:02:43.360 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
02:02:45.189 --> 02:02:45.199 align:start position:0%
if anyone wanted to take any time of
 
02:02:49.990 --> 02:02:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:51.510 --> 02:02:51.520 align:start position:0%
it's a public hearing and the floor will
 
02:02:55.589 --> 02:02:55.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:57.350 --> 02:02:57.360 align:start position:0%
i can start if it makes it makes it
 
02:02:59.430 --> 02:02:59.440 align:start position:0%
easier i know last term was my first
 
02:03:02.070 --> 02:03:02.080 align:start position:0%
term and i served with
 
02:03:05.350 --> 02:03:05.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:06.390 --> 02:03:06.400 align:start position:0%
and he was the chairman of this
 
02:03:07.669 --> 02:03:07.679 align:start position:0%
committee and believe it or not he
 
02:03:09.750 --> 02:03:09.760 align:start position:0%
taught me a lot
 
02:03:11.109 --> 02:03:11.119 align:start position:0%
i didn't use everything that he taught
 
02:03:14.470 --> 02:03:14.480 align:start position:0%
me to make his life easier but when i
 
02:03:15.750 --> 02:03:15.760 align:start position:0%
asked him why he would do such a thing
 
02:03:17.830 --> 02:03:17.840 align:start position:0%
he said it was about public service
 
02:03:17.840 --> 02:03:19.270 align:start position:0%
he said it was about public service
so

02:03:19.270 --> 02:03:19.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:03:22.950 --> 02:03:22.960 align:start position:0%
i carry that with me and you know
 
02:03:24.870 --> 02:03:24.880 align:start position:0%
i sometimes try to explain procedures to
 
02:03:27.189 --> 02:03:27.199 align:start position:0%
some other reps then use that to make
 
02:03:28.870 --> 02:03:28.880 align:start position:0%
my job more difficult
 
02:03:30.550 --> 02:03:30.560 align:start position:0%
but again it's about public service so
 
02:03:32.390 --> 02:03:32.400 align:start position:0%
that's what i learned from
 
02:03:34.470 --> 02:03:34.480 align:start position:0%
serving with representative cushing and
 
02:03:36.470 --> 02:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
that was meant a lot to me
 
02:03:36.480 --> 02:03:37.910 align:start position:0%
that was meant a lot to me
so

02:03:37.910 --> 02:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:03:39.669 --> 02:03:39.679 align:start position:0%
if anyone else wish to make any comments
 
02:03:40.830 --> 02:03:40.840 align:start position:0%
they'll be so
 
02:03:43.270 --> 02:03:43.280 align:start position:0%
recognized he also gave me some good
 
02:03:43.280 --> 02:03:45.270 align:start position:0%
recognized he also gave me some good
advice

02:03:45.270 --> 02:03:45.280 align:start position:0%
advice
 
02:03:46.870 --> 02:03:46.880 align:start position:0%
when i was appointed as chair the one
 
02:03:48.229 --> 02:03:48.239 align:start position:0%
thing he said was don't mess with the
 
02:03:48.239 --> 02:03:56.790 align:start position:0%
thing he said was don't mess with the
dean

02:03:56.790 --> 02:03:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:59.669 --> 02:03:59.679 align:start position:0%
that's the only advice he gave me and
 
02:03:59.679 --> 02:04:00.950 align:start position:0%
that's the only advice he gave me and
i've

02:04:00.950 --> 02:04:00.960 align:start position:0%
i've
 
02:04:26.950 --> 02:04:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:34.310 --> 02:04:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:36.790 --> 02:04:36.800 align:start position:0%
anyone any other members wish to
 
02:04:39.350 --> 02:04:39.360 align:start position:0%
represent muse
 
02:04:41.030 --> 02:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
i had um
 
02:04:42.709 --> 02:04:42.719 align:start position:0%
interesting experience with
 
02:04:42.719 --> 02:04:43.910 align:start position:0%
interesting experience with
representative

02:04:43.910 --> 02:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:04:45.830 --> 02:04:45.840 align:start position:0%
cushing having covered him
 
02:04:47.189 --> 02:04:47.199 align:start position:0%
as a reporter
 
02:04:49.910 --> 02:04:49.920 align:start position:0%
during his uh his seabrook days
 
02:04:49.920 --> 02:04:50.709 align:start position:0%
during his uh his seabrook days
and

02:04:50.709 --> 02:04:50.719 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:04:52.870 --> 02:04:52.880 align:start position:0%
looking at new hampshire from afar over
 
02:04:54.709 --> 02:04:54.719 align:start position:0%
the years
 
02:04:57.830 --> 02:04:57.840 align:start position:0%
i was out of state i had a 25-year gap
 
02:04:57.840 --> 02:04:59.189 align:start position:0%
i was out of state i had a 25-year gap
between

02:04:59.189 --> 02:04:59.199 align:start position:0%
between
 
02:05:00.709 --> 02:05:00.719 align:start position:0%
the jobs i had in new hampshire the
 
02:05:02.229 --> 02:05:02.239 align:start position:0%
first time and
 
02:05:05.350 --> 02:05:05.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:07.189 --> 02:05:07.199 align:start position:0%
and one of the things that uh that
 
02:05:10.070 --> 02:05:10.080 align:start position:0%
surprised me was how
 
02:05:12.790 --> 02:05:12.800 align:start position:0%
after so much time um
 
02:05:16.390 --> 02:05:16.400 align:start position:0%
he was still at it um you know not only
 
02:05:18.950 --> 02:05:18.960 align:start position:0%
trying to fight the good fight around um
 
02:05:21.910 --> 02:05:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:24.149 --> 02:05:24.159 align:start position:0%
around things like nuclear power but had
 
02:05:25.990 --> 02:05:26.000 align:start position:0%
expanded it
 
02:05:28.470 --> 02:05:28.480 align:start position:0%
into areas like the death penalty and i
 
02:05:28.480 --> 02:05:29.350 align:start position:0%
into areas like the death penalty and i
know

02:05:29.350 --> 02:05:29.360 align:start position:0%
know
 
02:05:32.229 --> 02:05:32.239 align:start position:0%
not all of us were always on the same
 
02:05:33.910 --> 02:05:33.920 align:start position:0%
page i think
 
02:05:36.470 --> 02:05:36.480 align:start position:0%
even some of us democrats sometimes
 
02:05:38.709 --> 02:05:38.719 align:start position:0%
were not necessarily always on the same
 
02:05:40.629 --> 02:05:40.639 align:start position:0%
page with everything that he advocated
 
02:05:40.639 --> 02:05:42.709 align:start position:0%
page with everything that he advocated
for

02:05:42.709 --> 02:05:42.719 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:05:43.990 --> 02:05:44.000 align:start position:0%
but we had
 
02:05:45.830 --> 02:05:45.840 align:start position:0%
great admiration
 
02:05:48.310 --> 02:05:48.320 align:start position:0%
for his passion and one of the things
 
02:05:51.270 --> 02:05:51.280 align:start position:0%
that he also did that i admired as a new
 
02:05:54.070 --> 02:05:54.080 align:start position:0%
legislator was
 
02:05:54.080 --> 02:05:55.430 align:start position:0%
legislator was
he

02:05:55.430 --> 02:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
he
 
02:05:58.550 --> 02:05:58.560 align:start position:0%
he made it a point to become skilled
 
02:06:00.229 --> 02:06:00.239 align:start position:0%
when it came to
 
02:06:02.709 --> 02:06:02.719 align:start position:0%
things like parliamentary motions and
 
02:06:05.189 --> 02:06:05.199 align:start position:0%
understanding how the process worked
 
02:06:06.790 --> 02:06:06.800 align:start position:0%
you know he clearly loved the new
 
02:06:09.270 --> 02:06:09.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire house uh his work with the
 
02:06:11.109 --> 02:06:11.119 align:start position:0%
anniversary committee
 
02:06:11.119 --> 02:06:11.910 align:start position:0%
anniversary committee
um

02:06:11.910 --> 02:06:11.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:14.149 --> 02:06:14.159 align:start position:0%
you know was really amazing and
 
02:06:14.159 --> 02:06:15.030 align:start position:0%
you know was really amazing and
uh

02:06:15.030 --> 02:06:15.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:06:18.070 --> 02:06:18.080 align:start position:0%
just a it it's an interesting thing to
 
02:06:20.790 --> 02:06:20.800 align:start position:0%
leave a place in your late 20s uh and
 
02:06:22.950 --> 02:06:22.960 align:start position:0%
come back and you're in your late 50s
 
02:06:24.550 --> 02:06:24.560 align:start position:0%
and to find some of the same people
 
02:06:27.189 --> 02:06:27.199 align:start position:0%
still in place uh and still making a
 
02:06:29.030 --> 02:06:29.040 align:start position:0%
difference um
 
02:06:31.109 --> 02:06:31.119 align:start position:0%
and he was somebody who through his
 
02:06:32.629 --> 02:06:32.639 align:start position:0%
entire life
 
02:06:32.639 --> 02:06:33.750 align:start position:0%
entire life
um

02:06:33.750 --> 02:06:33.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:35.270 --> 02:06:35.280 align:start position:0%
made a difference for the state and made
 
02:06:37.510 --> 02:06:37.520 align:start position:0%
a difference for the people around him
 
02:06:39.189 --> 02:06:39.199 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
02:06:42.470 --> 02:06:42.480 align:start position:0%
i know i miss him every day um
 
02:06:46.550 --> 02:06:46.560 align:start position:0%
and uh and i agree for his family um
 
02:06:49.030 --> 02:06:49.040 align:start position:0%
and for the state um
 
02:06:50.950 --> 02:06:50.960 align:start position:0%
he was an amazing individual and we're
 
02:06:52.950 --> 02:06:52.960 align:start position:0%
not gonna see too many more
 
02:06:54.229 --> 02:06:54.239 align:start position:0%
like him
 
02:07:07.830 --> 02:07:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:10.149 --> 02:07:10.159 align:start position:0%
well like i said i'm before the house
 
02:07:14.709 --> 02:07:14.719 align:start position:0%
i've known money since the seabrook days
 
02:07:17.030 --> 02:07:17.040 align:start position:0%
and i we're on different sides of the
 
02:07:19.270 --> 02:07:19.280 align:start position:0%
fence then
 
02:07:21.189 --> 02:07:21.199 align:start position:0%
one of the things i always admired about
 
02:07:23.990 --> 02:07:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:25.910 --> 02:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
is trying to do things for the public
 
02:07:25.920 --> 02:07:27.990 align:start position:0%
is trying to do things for the public
good

02:07:27.990 --> 02:07:28.000 align:start position:0%
good
 
02:07:31.990 --> 02:07:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:34.629 --> 02:07:34.639 align:start position:0%
i think most of us have that same goal
 
02:07:38.069 --> 02:07:38.079 align:start position:0%
we're all here for the same reasons
 
02:07:40.390 --> 02:07:40.400 align:start position:0%
sometimes those goals
 
02:07:40.400 --> 02:07:42.310 align:start position:0%
sometimes those goals
differ

02:07:42.310 --> 02:07:42.320 align:start position:0%
differ
 
02:07:44.790 --> 02:07:44.800 align:start position:0%
i always respected them
 
02:07:45.990 --> 02:07:46.000 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
02:07:48.390 --> 02:07:48.400 align:start position:0%
i liked them
 
02:07:50.390 --> 02:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
even though i didn't agree with them all
 
02:07:51.830 --> 02:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
that often
 
02:08:04.069 --> 02:08:04.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:04.079 --> 02:08:04.950 align:start position:0%
 
well

02:08:04.950 --> 02:08:04.960 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:08:04.960 --> 02:08:05.750 align:start position:0%
well
if

02:08:05.750 --> 02:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
if
 
02:08:07.589 --> 02:08:07.599 align:start position:0%
at this time we'll we're going to be in
 
02:08:10.550 --> 02:08:10.560 align:start position:0%
recess to 11 15 but if at any point a
 
02:08:12.470 --> 02:08:12.480 align:start position:0%
day any other members wish to
 
02:08:14.470 --> 02:08:14.480 align:start position:0%
take a moment of any personal privilege
 
02:08:16.149 --> 02:08:16.159 align:start position:0%
on that topic they would be so
 
02:08:16.159 --> 02:08:23.589 align:start position:0%
on that topic they would be so
recognized

02:08:23.589 --> 02:08:23.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:23.599 --> 02:08:24.390 align:start position:0%

legislation and this bill helps
 
02:23:23.910 --> 02:23:23.920 align:start position:0%
consolidate the goals of the house and
 
02:23:25.270 --> 02:23:25.280 align:start position:0%
the senate along with the various

02:23:28.990 --> 02:23:29.000 align:start position:0%
consensus solution
 
02:23:31.349 --> 02:23:31.359 align:start position:0%

02:24:11.429 --> 02:24:11.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:13.590 --> 02:24:13.600 align:start position:0%

sorry if i'm not as prepared as i would
 
02:24:22.389 --> 02:24:22.399 align:start position:0%
like to be but i have testified on
 
02:24:24.950 --> 02:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
similar bills uh before you on a similar
 
02:24:27.510 --> 02:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
bill before you hb1682
 
02:24:29.510 --> 02:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
this bill is functionally
 
02:24:31.830 --> 02:24:31.840 align:start position:0%
verbatim there is one change that had
 
02:24:34.870 --> 02:24:34.880 align:start position:0%
flagged for the committee
 
02:24:36.790 --> 02:24:36.800 align:start position:0%
there was an amendment in the senate
 
02:24:36.800 --> 02:24:39.429 align:start position:0%
there was an amendment in the senate
version

02:24:39.429 --> 02:24:39.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:43.830 --> 02:24:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:43.840 --> 02:24:44.630 align:start position:0%
 
2

02:24:44.630 --> 02:24:44.640 align:start position:0%
2
 
02:24:44.640 --> 02:24:45.830 align:start position:0%
2
3

02:24:45.830 --> 02:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
3
 
02:24:47.990 --> 02:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
of the bill lines
 
02:24:51.990 --> 02:24:52.000 align:start position:0%
34 35 and 36 were added
 
02:24:55.190 --> 02:24:55.200 align:start position:0%
i believe it was at after the inquiry of
 
02:24:58.230 --> 02:24:58.240 align:start position:0%
senator khan
 
02:24:58.240 --> 02:24:59.030 align:start position:0%
senator khan
who

02:24:59.030 --> 02:24:59.040 align:start position:0%
who
 
02:25:00.309 --> 02:25:00.319 align:start position:0%
thought it would be a good idea to
 
02:25:03.830 --> 02:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
define administrative suspension
 
02:25:05.830 --> 02:25:05.840 align:start position:0%
and so there's a definition in there
 
02:25:08.870 --> 02:25:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:11.110 --> 02:25:11.120 align:start position:0%
other than that it's uh basically
 
02:25:14.070 --> 02:25:14.080 align:start position:0%
verbatim um there wasn't an uh the house
 
02:25:15.670 --> 02:25:15.680 align:start position:0%
bill um
 
02:25:15.680 --> 02:25:16.389 align:start position:0%
bill um
the

02:25:16.389 --> 02:25:16.399 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:25:18.950 --> 02:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
when when it went to finance committee
 
02:25:21.270 --> 02:25:21.280 align:start position:0%
they slashed the appropriation in half
 
02:25:23.030 --> 02:25:23.040 align:start position:0%
the idea being is that the effective
 
02:25:25.910 --> 02:25:25.920 align:start position:0%
date was uh january 1st for this
 
02:25:27.349 --> 02:25:27.359 align:start position:0%
legislation and that they would only
 
02:25:29.429 --> 02:25:29.439 align:start position:0%
need six months of funding uh for the
 
02:25:33.030 --> 02:25:33.040 align:start position:0%
end of the biennium so um they they that
 
02:25:35.510 --> 02:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
that was their prerogative on that um i
 
02:25:37.670 --> 02:25:37.680 align:start position:0%
believe that's the version that had
 
02:25:40.950 --> 02:25:40.960 align:start position:0%
ended up passing the full house
 
02:25:42.790 --> 02:25:42.800 align:start position:0%
so other than that there are
 
02:25:46.230 --> 02:25:46.240 align:start position:0%
this bill is verbatim to which to hb
 
02:25:48.070 --> 02:25:48.080 align:start position:0%
1682 which this
 
02:25:48.080 --> 02:25:49.110 align:start position:0%
1682 which this
committee

02:25:49.110 --> 02:25:49.120 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:25:51.190 --> 02:25:51.200 align:start position:0%
passed unanimously which the house had
 
02:25:53.270 --> 02:25:53.280 align:start position:0%
passed unanimously
 
02:25:55.110 --> 02:25:55.120 align:start position:0%
so it therefore it serves the same
 
02:25:56.870 --> 02:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
purpose which is
 
02:25:58.309 --> 02:25:58.319 align:start position:0%
to provide
 
02:25:59.670 --> 02:25:59.680 align:start position:0%
oversight and accountability and
 
02:26:01.670 --> 02:26:01.680 align:start position:0%
investigations into police misconduct
 
02:26:03.670 --> 02:26:03.680 align:start position:0%
increased transparency for confirmed
 
02:26:06.230 --> 02:26:06.240 align:start position:0%
violations of police misconduct it
 
02:26:08.230 --> 02:26:08.240 align:start position:0%
promotes consistency and uniformity
 
02:26:09.990 --> 02:26:10.000 align:start position:0%
among police departments as to what
 
02:26:13.110 --> 02:26:13.120 align:start position:0%
constitutes reportable misconduct and it
 
02:26:15.030 --> 02:26:15.040 align:start position:0%
balances all of these important
 
02:26:17.670 --> 02:26:17.680 align:start position:0%
interests with maintaining the privacy
 
02:26:20.469 --> 02:26:20.479 align:start position:0%
interests of individual police officers
 
02:26:22.230 --> 02:26:22.240 align:start position:0%
who are the subject of frivolous
 
02:26:22.240 --> 02:26:23.429 align:start position:0%
who are the subject of frivolous
complaints

02:26:23.429 --> 02:26:23.439 align:start position:0%
complaints
 
02:26:25.270 --> 02:26:25.280 align:start position:0%
but it also allows local police chiefs
 
02:26:27.670 --> 02:26:27.680 align:start position:0%
to maintain local control over their
 
02:26:30.070 --> 02:26:30.080 align:start position:0%
employee discipline matters
 
02:26:32.309 --> 02:26:32.319 align:start position:0%
feedback that we've heard
 
02:26:34.469 --> 02:26:34.479 align:start position:0%
on all of these issues from diverse
 
02:26:36.870 --> 02:26:36.880 align:start position:0%
community stakeholders this was uh the
 
02:26:38.950 --> 02:26:38.960 align:start position:0%
brainchild of the governor's lee act
 
02:26:40.469 --> 02:26:40.479 align:start position:0%
commission um
 
02:26:42.790 --> 02:26:42.800 align:start position:0%
and it um
 
02:26:45.750 --> 02:26:45.760 align:start position:0%
it brought together people from all of
 
02:26:48.790 --> 02:26:48.800 align:start position:0%
over the the community
 
02:26:51.590 --> 02:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
and both law enforcement and non non-law
 
02:26:53.670 --> 02:26:53.680 align:start position:0%
enforcement and this was a unanimous
 
02:26:55.349 --> 02:26:55.359 align:start position:0%
recommendation from that committee as
 
02:26:57.990 --> 02:26:58.000 align:start position:0%
well to to stand this thing up there's
 
02:26:59.750 --> 02:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
about two years of work that went into
 
02:26:59.760 --> 02:27:00.550 align:start position:0%
about two years of work that went into
this

02:27:00.550 --> 02:27:00.560 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:27:03.110 --> 02:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation with a with a
 
02:27:06.230 --> 02:27:06.240 align:start position:0%
diverse group of of people
 
02:27:10.070 --> 02:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
and it it strikes a much needed balance
 
02:27:11.429 --> 02:27:11.439 align:start position:0%
and makes
 
02:27:13.670 --> 02:27:13.680 align:start position:0%
great progress in an area that new
 
02:27:16.309 --> 02:27:16.319 align:start position:0%
hampshire has already been a leader on
 
02:27:17.190 --> 02:27:17.200 align:start position:0%
which is
 
02:27:17.200 --> 02:27:19.270 align:start position:0%
which is
increasing

02:27:19.270 --> 02:27:19.280 align:start position:0%
increasing
 
02:27:19.280 --> 02:27:20.630 align:start position:0%
increasing
accountability

02:27:20.630 --> 02:27:20.640 align:start position:0%
accountability
 
02:27:22.550 --> 02:27:22.560 align:start position:0%
in policing but doing it in new
 
02:27:24.630 --> 02:27:24.640 align:start position:0%
hampshire's way
 
02:27:24.640 --> 02:27:26.389 align:start position:0%
hampshire's way
so

02:27:26.389 --> 02:27:26.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:27:29.670 --> 02:27:29.680 align:start position:0%

committee that was appointed by the

attention
 
02:28:30.309 --> 02:28:30.319 align:start position:0%
and i certainly stand ready for any
 
02:28:31.750 --> 02:28:31.760 align:start position:0%
questions or concerns that you might
 
02:28:35.110 --> 02:28:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:37.190 --> 02:28:37.200 align:start position:0%
a question to the chairs is there any
 
02:28:39.190 --> 02:28:39.200 align:start position:0%
advantage that you see to this
 
02:28:41.910 --> 02:28:41.920 align:start position:0%
particular bill over the house version
 
02:28:44.710 --> 02:28:44.720 align:start position:0%
it is uh my understanding that uh the
 
02:28:44.720 --> 02:28:45.670 align:start position:0%
it is uh my understanding that uh the
two

02:28:45.670 --> 02:28:45.680 align:start position:0%
two
 
02:28:48.309 --> 02:28:48.319 align:start position:0%
bills as amended uh
 
02:28:51.590 --> 02:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
are uh duplicative they they uh are
 
02:28:54.309 --> 02:28:54.319 align:start position:0%
exactly the same
 
02:28:56.230 --> 02:28:56.240 align:start position:0%
except for the i think the funding which
 
02:28:57.830 --> 02:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
was the only difference
 
02:29:01.110 --> 02:29:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:03.910 --> 02:29:03.920 align:start position:0%
representative panelakis
 
02:29:06.950 --> 02:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh director could
 
02:29:08.790 --> 02:29:08.800 align:start position:0%
you uh
 
02:29:09.750 --> 02:29:09.760 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
02:29:12.230 --> 02:29:12.240 align:start position:0%
walk me through how this works
 
02:29:14.230 --> 02:29:14.240 align:start position:0%
uh does this take it away from the
 
02:29:16.070 --> 02:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
chiefs level or
 
02:29:17.910 --> 02:29:17.920 align:start position:0%
how it works
 
02:29:19.910 --> 02:29:19.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question and that uh
 
02:29:19.920 --> 02:29:20.790 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question and that uh
uh

02:29:20.790 --> 02:29:20.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:29:22.870 --> 02:29:22.880 align:start position:0%
you make a terrific observation we
 
02:29:25.110 --> 02:29:25.120 align:start position:0%
really wanted to balance
 
02:29:25.120 --> 02:29:26.070 align:start position:0%
really wanted to balance
uh

02:29:26.070 --> 02:29:26.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:29:28.630 --> 02:29:28.640 align:start position:0%
the interests of making sure that the
 
02:29:30.710 --> 02:29:30.720 align:start position:0%
local police chief
 
02:29:32.870 --> 02:29:32.880 align:start position:0%
had um
 
02:29:34.790 --> 02:29:34.800 align:start position:0%
we did not take away any authority from
 
02:29:36.870 --> 02:29:36.880 align:start position:0%
that local police chief
 
02:29:38.070 --> 02:29:38.080 align:start position:0%
to handle
 
02:29:40.630 --> 02:29:40.640 align:start position:0%
his or her employees
 
02:29:43.030 --> 02:29:43.040 align:start position:0%
and really this
 
02:29:44.870 --> 02:29:44.880 align:start position:0%
as this bill is designed it's really a
 
02:29:47.190 --> 02:29:47.200 align:start position:0%
belt and suspender kind of
 
02:29:49.910 --> 02:29:49.920 align:start position:0%
situation where the the investigation
 
02:29:51.830 --> 02:29:51.840 align:start position:0%
would occur at a local level
 
02:29:53.910 --> 02:29:53.920 align:start position:0%
and then that investigation
 
02:29:56.230 --> 02:29:56.240 align:start position:0%
just to to um
 
02:29:58.790 --> 02:29:58.800 align:start position:0%
provide objective review would then come
 
02:30:01.110 --> 02:30:01.120 align:start position:0%
to the uh misconduct committee that they
 
02:30:03.750 --> 02:30:03.760 align:start position:0%
could look at it uh in a very objective
 
02:30:05.429 --> 02:30:05.439 align:start position:0%
way and make sure that it was done
 
02:30:08.710 --> 02:30:08.720 align:start position:0%
appropriately uh that the uh allegation
 
02:30:09.990 --> 02:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
was addressed
 
02:30:12.389 --> 02:30:12.399 align:start position:0%
and uh that the facts were found or
 
02:30:15.510 --> 02:30:15.520 align:start position:0%
sought out and that the uh facts
 
02:30:17.990 --> 02:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
resulted in the ultimate
 
02:30:19.990 --> 02:30:20.000 align:start position:0%
finding of that investigation whether
 
02:30:22.070 --> 02:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
it's sustained or not sustained
 
02:30:23.750 --> 02:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
but we wanted to make sure that we we
 
02:30:25.830 --> 02:30:25.840 align:start position:0%
did not in any way
 
02:30:27.750 --> 02:30:27.760 align:start position:0%
impede on that local
 
02:30:30.630 --> 02:30:30.640 align:start position:0%
chief law enforcement officer
 
02:30:33.830 --> 02:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
thank you very much you're welcome man
 
02:30:35.270 --> 02:30:35.280 align:start position:0%
another question of the chair if you
 
02:30:36.230 --> 02:30:36.240 align:start position:0%
don't mind
 
02:30:38.469 --> 02:30:38.479 align:start position:0%
what um is there a mandatory reporting
 
02:30:41.670 --> 02:30:41.680 align:start position:0%
requirement by by chiefs for um once
 
02:30:43.270 --> 02:30:43.280 align:start position:0%
they make a disciplinary action against
 
02:30:45.030 --> 02:30:45.040 align:start position:0%
an officer to you
 
02:30:48.710 --> 02:30:48.720 align:start position:0%
uh within this bill sir yes yes uh the
 
02:30:51.349 --> 02:30:51.359 align:start position:0%
the bill would require that um in the
 
02:30:52.710 --> 02:30:52.720 align:start position:0%
first instance
 
02:30:54.950 --> 02:30:54.960 align:start position:0%
uh we'll have some outward facing ways
 
02:30:57.910 --> 02:30:57.920 align:start position:0%
to collect allegations and complaints
 
02:31:00.710 --> 02:31:00.720 align:start position:0%
and then we would in document that that
 
02:31:02.950 --> 02:31:02.960 align:start position:0%
it came in we would then refer that to
 
02:31:05.030 --> 02:31:05.040 align:start position:0%
the chief law enforcement officer
 
02:31:07.110 --> 02:31:07.120 align:start position:0%
uh with with the understanding that the
 
02:31:08.790 --> 02:31:08.800 align:start position:0%
chief law enforcement officer will then
 
02:31:10.710 --> 02:31:10.720 align:start position:0%
conduct that internal investigation and
 
02:31:12.230 --> 02:31:12.240 align:start position:0%
then the results of that would come back
 
02:31:15.030 --> 02:31:15.040 align:start position:0%
to the the conduct review committee
 
02:31:16.790 --> 02:31:16.800 align:start position:0%
they would review that uh there's going
 
02:31:19.349 --> 02:31:19.359 align:start position:0%
to be an attorney that was going to
 
02:31:21.510 --> 02:31:21.520 align:start position:0%
run that that review
 
02:31:23.670 --> 02:31:23.680 align:start position:0%
uh if if the committee felt that it was
 
02:31:25.590 --> 02:31:25.600 align:start position:0%
not done appropriately or there was more
 
02:31:28.790 --> 02:31:28.800 align:start position:0%
facts that needed to be sought out
 
02:31:30.469 --> 02:31:30.479 align:start position:0%
we would have investigators that would
 
02:31:32.710 --> 02:31:32.720 align:start position:0%
come and help that local police chief do
 
02:31:32.720 --> 02:31:34.870 align:start position:0%
come and help that local police chief do
that

02:31:34.870 --> 02:31:34.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:31:34.880 --> 02:31:36.950 align:start position:0%
that
likewise

02:31:36.950 --> 02:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
likewise
 
02:31:39.670 --> 02:31:39.680 align:start position:0%
this bill also provides a mandatory
 
02:31:41.830 --> 02:31:41.840 align:start position:0%
report so if if somebody goes directly
 
02:31:43.510 --> 02:31:43.520 align:start position:0%
to the chief and says hey one of your
 
02:31:46.550 --> 02:31:46.560 align:start position:0%
officers uh acted inappropriately and we
 
02:31:48.309 --> 02:31:48.319 align:start position:0%
feel that falls within the definition of
 
02:31:48.319 --> 02:31:49.750 align:start position:0%
feel that falls within the definition of
misconduct

02:31:49.750 --> 02:31:49.760 align:start position:0%
misconduct
 
02:31:49.760 --> 02:31:50.710 align:start position:0%
misconduct
uh

02:31:50.710 --> 02:31:50.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:31:52.150 --> 02:31:52.160 align:start position:0%
they would have to report that they
 
02:31:54.230 --> 02:31:54.240 align:start position:0%
received that complaint and that they
 
02:31:55.830 --> 02:31:55.840 align:start position:0%
are following up on an internal
 
02:31:55.840 --> 02:31:57.190 align:start position:0%
are following up on an internal
investigation

02:31:57.190 --> 02:31:57.200 align:start position:0%
investigation
 
02:31:58.630 --> 02:31:58.640 align:start position:0%
and then the same process would hold
 
02:32:01.590 --> 02:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
true once that ia is completed it would
 
02:32:03.910 --> 02:32:03.920 align:start position:0%
come to our review committee uh it would
 
02:32:05.990 --> 02:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
be vetted to make sure that it was done
 
02:32:07.910 --> 02:32:07.920 align:start position:0%
appropriately that the facts
 
02:32:09.910 --> 02:32:09.920 align:start position:0%
support the finding
 
02:32:11.110 --> 02:32:11.120 align:start position:0%
and then
 
02:32:12.469 --> 02:32:12.479 align:start position:0%
if need be
 
02:32:14.950 --> 02:32:14.960 align:start position:0%
then that attorney
 
02:32:14.960 --> 02:32:16.710 align:start position:0%
then that attorney
would

02:32:16.710 --> 02:32:16.720 align:start position:0%
would
 
02:32:19.110 --> 02:32:19.120 align:start position:0%
bring an action to
 
02:32:21.349 --> 02:32:21.359 align:start position:0%
police standards and training council
 
02:32:24.870 --> 02:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
on that officer's certification
 
02:32:27.910 --> 02:32:27.920 align:start position:0%
and so it kind of it helps separate the
 
02:32:31.110 --> 02:32:31.120 align:start position:0%
uh the investigative function from the
 
02:32:32.550 --> 02:32:32.560 align:start position:0%
those folks that are going to be making
 
02:32:34.790 --> 02:32:34.800 align:start position:0%
the ultimate decision on on the officer
 
02:32:34.800 --> 02:32:37.190 align:start position:0%
the ultimate decision on on the officer
certification

02:32:37.190 --> 02:32:37.200 align:start position:0%
certification
 
02:32:38.950 --> 02:32:38.960 align:start position:0%
thank you and so
 
02:32:43.190 --> 02:32:43.200 align:start position:0%
if an officer is being investigated um
 
02:32:46.630 --> 02:32:46.640 align:start position:0%
and the officer chooses to resign
 
02:32:48.950 --> 02:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
the the reporting requirement cannot be
 
02:32:51.990 --> 02:32:52.000 align:start position:0%
waived is that correct that is correct
 
02:32:54.790 --> 02:32:54.800 align:start position:0%
and in fact um
 
02:32:54.800 --> 02:32:56.070 align:start position:0%
and in fact um
presently

02:32:56.070 --> 02:32:56.080 align:start position:0%
presently
 
02:32:56.080 --> 02:32:56.870 align:start position:0%
presently
uh

02:32:56.870 --> 02:32:56.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:32:59.349 --> 02:32:59.359 align:start position:0%
that's how we handle it we still require
 
02:33:02.150 --> 02:33:02.160 align:start position:0%
that that police chief report to us that
 
02:33:02.160 --> 02:33:03.030 align:start position:0%
that that police chief report to us that
the

02:33:03.030 --> 02:33:03.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:33:05.030 --> 02:33:05.040 align:start position:0%
the particular officer was a target of
 
02:33:08.389 --> 02:33:08.399 align:start position:0%
an ia and that they resigned
 
02:33:10.550 --> 02:33:10.560 align:start position:0%
during an investigation or in lieu of
 
02:33:10.560 --> 02:33:12.070 align:start position:0%
during an investigation or in lieu of
termination

02:33:12.070 --> 02:33:12.080 align:start position:0%
termination
 
02:33:14.150 --> 02:33:14.160 align:start position:0%
so we
 
02:33:15.990 --> 02:33:16.000 align:start position:0%
tried to be as very transparent as
 
02:33:18.389 --> 02:33:18.399 align:start position:0%
possible collecting that information
 
02:33:18.399 --> 02:33:19.750 align:start position:0%
possible collecting that information
and

02:33:19.750 --> 02:33:19.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:33:21.830 --> 02:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
we have
 
02:33:24.309 --> 02:33:24.319 align:start position:0%
in furtherance of that we are
 
02:33:26.150 --> 02:33:26.160 align:start position:0%
we're trying to work through our
 
02:33:28.710 --> 02:33:28.720 align:start position:0%
administrative rules and our process to
 
02:33:31.429 --> 02:33:31.439 align:start position:0%
to make those kinds of records
 
02:33:35.349 --> 02:33:35.359 align:start position:0%
you know uh public uh that is uh
 
02:33:36.870 --> 02:33:36.880 align:start position:0%
we would still have some work ahead of
 
02:33:40.309 --> 02:33:40.319 align:start position:0%
us with regard to that but we we do um
 
02:33:43.190 --> 02:33:43.200 align:start position:0%
try to to respond to any kind of 91a
 
02:33:45.190 --> 02:33:45.200 align:start position:0%
request with regard to that balancing
 
02:33:48.950 --> 02:33:48.960 align:start position:0%
the interest of the of the officer
 
02:33:51.990 --> 02:33:52.000 align:start position:0%
representative panamakis
 
02:33:53.910 --> 02:33:53.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
02:33:55.110 --> 02:33:55.120 align:start position:0%
you cannot
 
02:33:57.830 --> 02:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
excuse me for so many questions not at
 
02:34:01.510 --> 02:34:01.520 align:start position:0%
all but can a citizen from the town or
 
02:34:03.750 --> 02:34:03.760 align:start position:0%
city that the police officer
 
02:34:04.790 --> 02:34:04.800 align:start position:0%
is in
 
02:34:07.510 --> 02:34:07.520 align:start position:0%
come to you with this uh problem before
 
02:34:08.870 --> 02:34:08.880 align:start position:0%
the chief
 
02:34:08.880 --> 02:34:09.990 align:start position:0%
the chief
absolutely

02:34:09.990 --> 02:34:10.000 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
02:34:11.349 --> 02:34:11.359 align:start position:0%
and we would we would take that
 
02:34:11.359 --> 02:34:12.469 align:start position:0%
and we would we would take that
complaint

02:34:12.469 --> 02:34:12.479 align:start position:0%
complaint
 
02:34:14.870 --> 02:34:14.880 align:start position:0%
and then uh by virtue of this bill then
 
02:34:15.990 --> 02:34:16.000 align:start position:0%
we would
 
02:34:18.070 --> 02:34:18.080 align:start position:0%
let that police chief know this is what
 
02:34:18.080 --> 02:34:19.030 align:start position:0%
let that police chief know this is what
happened

02:34:19.030 --> 02:34:19.040 align:start position:0%
happened
 
02:34:21.590 --> 02:34:21.600 align:start position:0%
and it needs to be investigated or
 
02:34:23.830 --> 02:34:23.840 align:start position:0%
we may take the complaint and it may not
 
02:34:26.630 --> 02:34:26.640 align:start position:0%
fit the definition of misconduct as
 
02:34:28.950 --> 02:34:28.960 align:start position:0%
outlined in this bill
 
02:34:30.870 --> 02:34:30.880 align:start position:0%
so as inclusive as we want to be to make
 
02:34:32.950 --> 02:34:32.960 align:start position:0%
sure we're addressing misconduct
 
02:34:33.990 --> 02:34:34.000 align:start position:0%
if it's a
 
02:34:36.230 --> 02:34:36.240 align:start position:0%
if it's a in-house issue if it's a
 
02:34:38.150 --> 02:34:38.160 align:start position:0%
personnel issue if it's a
 
02:34:41.510 --> 02:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
performance issue like work um
 
02:34:43.510 --> 02:34:43.520 align:start position:0%
those would not come under the purview
 
02:34:46.150 --> 02:34:46.160 align:start position:0%
of of this committee
 
02:34:48.230 --> 02:34:48.240 align:start position:0%
i i just think it would have been better
 
02:34:50.630 --> 02:34:50.640 align:start position:0%
for portsmouth that you've been around
 
02:34:51.910 --> 02:34:51.920 align:start position:0%
to do this
 
02:34:54.389 --> 02:34:54.399 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome
 
02:34:57.190 --> 02:34:57.200 align:start position:0%
representative marston
 
02:34:59.110 --> 02:34:59.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
02:35:01.750 --> 02:35:01.760 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:35:04.389 --> 02:35:04.399 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering about in the bill is there
 
02:35:07.190 --> 02:35:07.200 align:start position:0%
guidelines for people that make false
 
02:35:10.309 --> 02:35:10.319 align:start position:0%
testimonies or false accusations and is
 
02:35:13.190 --> 02:35:13.200 align:start position:0%
there a follow-up were there
 
02:35:15.990 --> 02:35:16.000 align:start position:0%
prosecuted or brought to justice
 
02:35:18.550 --> 02:35:18.560 align:start position:0%
that that is a a
 
02:35:21.590 --> 02:35:21.600 align:start position:0%
a topic that uh law enforcement has had
 
02:35:25.429 --> 02:35:25.439 align:start position:0%
to deal with uh forever and during my
 
02:35:28.309 --> 02:35:28.319 align:start position:0%
experiences as a law enforcement officer
 
02:35:30.469 --> 02:35:30.479 align:start position:0%
and and running a police department uh
 
02:35:31.910 --> 02:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
there was always
 
02:35:31.920 --> 02:35:33.030 align:start position:0%
there was always
uh

02:35:33.030 --> 02:35:33.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:35:35.349 --> 02:35:35.359 align:start position:0%
that notion of making sure that you know
 
02:35:37.030 --> 02:35:37.040 align:start position:0%
people are telling the truth when they
 
02:35:39.590 --> 02:35:39.600 align:start position:0%
file a report and if they file a false
 
02:35:41.670 --> 02:35:41.680 align:start position:0%
police report
 
02:35:44.230 --> 02:35:44.240 align:start position:0%
they do extend themselves into the
 
02:35:47.110 --> 02:35:47.120 align:start position:0%
liability of of being subject to
 
02:35:49.990 --> 02:35:50.000 align:start position:0%
being criminally charged for that
 
02:35:51.800 --> 02:35:51.810 align:start position:0%
i think it's important to
 
02:35:51.810 --> 02:35:53.349 align:start position:0%
i think it's important to
[Music]

02:35:53.349 --> 02:35:53.359 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:35:57.110 --> 02:35:57.120 align:start position:0%
really make sure that if if the charges
 
02:35:58.870 --> 02:35:58.880 align:start position:0%
were going to be brought
 
02:35:58.880 --> 02:36:00.230 align:start position:0%
were going to be brought
uh

02:36:00.230 --> 02:36:00.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:36:02.230 --> 02:36:02.240 align:start position:0%
that it is it was
 
02:36:04.150 --> 02:36:04.160 align:start position:0%
clearly falsely reported because they
 
02:36:06.870 --> 02:36:06.880 align:start position:0%
were trying to cause harm
 
02:36:09.590 --> 02:36:09.600 align:start position:0%
to the officer as opposed to just their
 
02:36:12.230 --> 02:36:12.240 align:start position:0%
perception of what may have happened and
 
02:36:13.990 --> 02:36:14.000 align:start position:0%
that's uh you know that's that's
 
02:36:16.469 --> 02:36:16.479 align:start position:0%
something that we we deal with every day
 
02:36:18.150 --> 02:36:18.160 align:start position:0%
um so there there
 
02:36:19.990 --> 02:36:20.000 align:start position:0%
just need to be a lot of common sense
 
02:36:22.469 --> 02:36:22.479 align:start position:0%
applied to this if we're going to charge
 
02:36:25.830 --> 02:36:25.840 align:start position:0%
somebody for filing a false report but
 
02:36:29.349 --> 02:36:29.359 align:start position:0%
but that is available absolutely
 
02:36:31.270 --> 02:36:31.280 align:start position:0%
so my follow-up question there is
 
02:36:34.950 --> 02:36:34.960 align:start position:0%
guidelines within this that cover that
 
02:36:36.790 --> 02:36:36.800 align:start position:0%
i don't believe that there's guidelines
 
02:36:39.670 --> 02:36:39.680 align:start position:0%
specific to this but this bill does not
 
02:36:42.710 --> 02:36:42.720 align:start position:0%
negate the ability for us
 
02:36:42.720 --> 02:36:43.670 align:start position:0%
negate the ability for us
to

02:36:43.670 --> 02:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:36:47.510 --> 02:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
uh bring forward charges of an unflaunt
 
02:36:51.670 --> 02:36:51.680 align:start position:0%
unsworn false uh force falsification
 
02:36:53.030 --> 02:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
or uh
 
02:36:55.830 --> 02:36:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:57.670 --> 02:36:57.680 align:start position:0%
report that's not accurate you know we
 
02:36:59.349 --> 02:36:59.359 align:start position:0%
we could bring those charges under state
 
02:36:59.359 --> 02:37:00.309 align:start position:0%
we could bring those charges under state
law

02:37:00.309 --> 02:37:00.319 align:start position:0%
law
 
02:37:02.309 --> 02:37:02.319 align:start position:0%
thank you if i might clarify it
 
02:37:04.309 --> 02:37:04.319 align:start position:0%
currently exists within the law for to
 
02:37:05.830 --> 02:37:05.840 align:start position:0%
for to bring a charge for a false
 
02:37:07.830 --> 02:37:07.840 align:start position:0%
statement so it's not required in the
 
02:37:09.910 --> 02:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
bill um representative newman you had a
 
02:37:09.920 --> 02:37:10.870 align:start position:0%
bill um representative newman you had a
question

02:37:10.870 --> 02:37:10.880 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:37:14.309 --> 02:37:14.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:17.270 --> 02:37:17.280 align:start position:0%
thank you does this um would this have
 
02:37:17.280 --> 02:37:18.550 align:start position:0%
thank you does this um would this have
any

02:37:18.550 --> 02:37:18.560 align:start position:0%
any
 
02:37:21.110 --> 02:37:21.120 align:start position:0%
work in collaboration with the local
 
02:37:23.590 --> 02:37:23.600 align:start position:0%
police commissions or is it a totally
 
02:37:25.110 --> 02:37:25.120 align:start position:0%
separate thing or do you work
 
02:37:27.590 --> 02:37:27.600 align:start position:0%
collaboratively thank you
 
02:37:30.070 --> 02:37:30.080 align:start position:0%
that's a wonderful question and candidly
 
02:37:31.910 --> 02:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
i will tell you that i i don't know that
 
02:37:33.990 --> 02:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
that came up during the conversation
 
02:37:36.950 --> 02:37:36.960 align:start position:0%
when we were uh fashioning this bill
 
02:37:39.030 --> 02:37:39.040 align:start position:0%
uh i don't believe
 
02:37:39.040 --> 02:37:40.550 align:start position:0%
uh i don't believe
uh

02:37:40.550 --> 02:37:40.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:37:42.550 --> 02:37:42.560 align:start position:0%
that we brought that topic up and i
 
02:37:44.950 --> 02:37:44.960 align:start position:0%
think really our our concern was to make
 
02:37:46.469 --> 02:37:46.479 align:start position:0%
sure that we were
 
02:37:48.630 --> 02:37:48.640 align:start position:0%
not excluding the chief law enforcement
 
02:37:50.630 --> 02:37:50.640 align:start position:0%
officer who has
 
02:37:52.710 --> 02:37:52.720 align:start position:0%
the statutory authority
 
02:37:54.950 --> 02:37:54.960 align:start position:0%
and responsibility to manage the
 
02:37:59.190 --> 02:37:59.200 align:start position:0%
employees under his or her control
 
02:38:00.710 --> 02:38:00.720 align:start position:0%
i i don't know
 
02:38:00.720 --> 02:38:01.830 align:start position:0%
i i don't know
uh

02:38:01.830 --> 02:38:01.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:38:04.469 --> 02:38:04.479 align:start position:0%
how that interaction would occur based
 
02:38:07.270 --> 02:38:07.280 align:start position:0%
on the bill as it is presented i mean
 
02:38:09.110 --> 02:38:09.120 align:start position:0%
candidly we're all in this together and
 
02:38:10.950 --> 02:38:10.960 align:start position:0%
we would all need to work together to
 
02:38:12.230 --> 02:38:12.240 align:start position:0%
make sure that
 
02:38:12.240 --> 02:38:13.190 align:start position:0%
make sure that
uh

02:38:13.190 --> 02:38:13.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:38:15.190 --> 02:38:15.200 align:start position:0%
a police officer that commits misconduct
 
02:38:17.030 --> 02:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
as defined as held accountable for that
 
02:38:19.750 --> 02:38:19.760 align:start position:0%
and if that would include a local police
 
02:38:21.510 --> 02:38:21.520 align:start position:0%
commission to be part of that discussion
 
02:38:23.349 --> 02:38:23.359 align:start position:0%
then uh i'm sure
 
02:38:25.510 --> 02:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
that that that would happen but it is
 
02:38:27.270 --> 02:38:27.280 align:start position:0%
not addressed in the legislation has
 
02:38:27.280 --> 02:38:29.349 align:start position:0%
not addressed in the legislation has
proposed

02:38:29.349 --> 02:38:29.359 align:start position:0%
proposed
 
02:38:31.349 --> 02:38:31.359 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome
 
02:38:32.870 --> 02:38:32.880 align:start position:0%
to be clear though if there is a
 
02:38:34.950 --> 02:38:34.960 align:start position:0%
reporting requirement from a chief to a
 
02:38:36.870 --> 02:38:36.880 align:start position:0%
police commission this bill would not in
 
02:38:38.469 --> 02:38:38.479 align:start position:0%
any way negate that or waive that
 
02:38:40.230 --> 02:38:40.240 align:start position:0%
correct that is correct mr chairman
 
02:38:43.990 --> 02:38:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:45.510 --> 02:38:45.520 align:start position:0%
representative burt
 
02:38:47.429 --> 02:38:47.439 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
02:38:49.910 --> 02:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
and uh thank you for your testimony uh
 
02:38:53.349 --> 02:38:53.359 align:start position:0%
my understanding is uh just to clarify
 
02:38:56.469 --> 02:38:56.479 align:start position:0%
the false accusation law
 
02:38:58.950 --> 02:38:58.960 align:start position:0%
that it's virtually never
 
02:39:02.150 --> 02:39:02.160 align:start position:0%
used um so could you do you know when
 
02:39:03.750 --> 02:39:03.760 align:start position:0%
the last time anybody's ever been
 
02:39:06.230 --> 02:39:06.240 align:start position:0%
charged with it because it is
 
02:39:08.309 --> 02:39:08.319 align:start position:0%
so vague or i guess this is what i'm
 
02:39:10.550 --> 02:39:10.560 align:start position:0%
being told that it's very vague that
 
02:39:12.790 --> 02:39:12.800 align:start position:0%
i may believe what i wrote
 
02:39:14.550 --> 02:39:14.560 align:start position:0%
but it's really a lie
 
02:39:15.990 --> 02:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
and all i have to do is go to court and
 
02:39:17.990 --> 02:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
say i believe what i wrote and it's
 
02:39:19.830 --> 02:39:19.840 align:start position:0%
pretty much a done deal that's it's
 
02:39:19.840 --> 02:39:21.190 align:start position:0%
pretty much a done deal that's it's
dismissed

02:39:21.190 --> 02:39:21.200 align:start position:0%
dismissed
 
02:39:23.429 --> 02:39:23.439 align:start position:0%
i thank you for your question sir i i
 
02:39:26.469 --> 02:39:26.479 align:start position:0%
cannot speak with with uh any accuracy
 
02:39:29.110 --> 02:39:29.120 align:start position:0%
with regard to when the last time
 
02:39:32.070 --> 02:39:32.080 align:start position:0%
anyone has ever been charged with that
 
02:39:34.309 --> 02:39:34.319 align:start position:0%
i can tell you in my experience as a
 
02:39:37.510 --> 02:39:37.520 align:start position:0%
police chief and as a police officer
 
02:39:39.830 --> 02:39:39.840 align:start position:0%
there were times when uh
 
02:39:41.510 --> 02:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
an investigation
 
02:39:43.190 --> 02:39:43.200 align:start position:0%
was launched because of an allegation
 
02:39:43.200 --> 02:39:44.150 align:start position:0%
was launched because of an allegation
made

02:39:44.150 --> 02:39:44.160 align:start position:0%
made
 
02:39:46.070 --> 02:39:46.080 align:start position:0%
and it turned out
 
02:39:47.349 --> 02:39:47.359 align:start position:0%
during the investigation that the
 
02:39:49.830 --> 02:39:49.840 align:start position:0%
allegation was false and we if we could
 
02:39:52.389 --> 02:39:52.399 align:start position:0%
prove that beyond a reasonable doubt and
 
02:39:55.190 --> 02:39:55.200 align:start position:0%
we felt that the culpability of that
 
02:39:59.190 --> 02:39:59.200 align:start position:0%
that false report was such to cause harm
 
02:40:01.750 --> 02:40:01.760 align:start position:0%
uh then we felt confident to bring those
 
02:40:03.349 --> 02:40:03.359 align:start position:0%
charges forward
 
02:40:06.389 --> 02:40:06.399 align:start position:0%
uh there are some times when you know uh
 
02:40:06.399 --> 02:40:07.990 align:start position:0%
uh there are some times when you know uh
people

02:40:07.990 --> 02:40:08.000 align:start position:0%
people
 
02:40:09.750 --> 02:40:09.760 align:start position:0%
they they know the truth as their own
 
02:40:11.910 --> 02:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
perception of what they saw
 
02:40:14.550 --> 02:40:14.560 align:start position:0%
and uh and again you know going back to
 
02:40:16.630 --> 02:40:16.640 align:start position:0%
my earlier comment uh there are
 
02:40:19.349 --> 02:40:19.359 align:start position:0%
sometimes that the the spirit of the law
 
02:40:21.990 --> 02:40:22.000 align:start position:0%
would not apply uh in a case where maybe
 
02:40:23.910 --> 02:40:23.920 align:start position:0%
a report was filed
 
02:40:27.190 --> 02:40:27.200 align:start position:0%
in in a passionate way where they really
 
02:40:28.870 --> 02:40:28.880 align:start position:0%
were not
 
02:40:31.510 --> 02:40:31.520 align:start position:0%
lying in so much as they were speaking
 
02:40:36.710 --> 02:40:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:39.030 --> 02:40:39.040 align:start position:0%
i would tell you that
 
02:40:40.790 --> 02:40:40.800 align:start position:0%
when emotions are high
 
02:40:42.710 --> 02:40:42.720 align:start position:0%
people believe that they said and did
 
02:40:46.150 --> 02:40:46.160 align:start position:0%
things and when we look at video
 
02:40:49.110 --> 02:40:49.120 align:start position:0%
of that same event uh oftentimes it is
 
02:40:51.349 --> 02:40:51.359 align:start position:0%
different because human beings are
 
02:40:52.790 --> 02:40:52.800 align:start position:0%
involved so
 
02:40:53.910 --> 02:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
i don't know if that answers your
 
02:40:55.429 --> 02:40:55.439 align:start position:0%
question sir but i appreciate the
 
02:40:57.750 --> 02:40:57.760 align:start position:0%
question it does and thank you uh you
 
02:40:59.670 --> 02:40:59.680 align:start position:0%
know i just that's why i love uh body
 
02:40:59.680 --> 02:41:00.830 align:start position:0%
know i just that's why i love uh body
cameras

02:41:00.830 --> 02:41:00.840 align:start position:0%
cameras
 
02:41:07.590 --> 02:41:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:09.990 --> 02:41:10.000 align:start position:0%
uh quick question to the chair
 
02:41:11.910 --> 02:41:11.920 align:start position:0%
when you move against an officer
 
02:41:13.910 --> 02:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
certification what's the standard of
 
02:41:15.429 --> 02:41:15.439 align:start position:0%
proof um
 
02:41:15.439 --> 02:41:16.469 align:start position:0%
proof um
i

02:41:16.469 --> 02:41:16.479 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:41:18.710 --> 02:41:18.720 align:start position:0%
presently it's uh beyond a preponderance
 
02:41:21.190 --> 02:41:21.200 align:start position:0%
of the evidence so it would be the same
 
02:41:23.190 --> 02:41:23.200 align:start position:0%
level of proof needed to prove a civil
 
02:41:25.830 --> 02:41:25.840 align:start position:0%
case in trial it is not uh
 
02:41:28.070 --> 02:41:28.080 align:start position:0%
that higher burden of beyond a
 
02:41:30.710 --> 02:41:30.720 align:start position:0%
reasonable doubt
 
02:41:32.070 --> 02:41:32.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:41:33.830 --> 02:41:33.840 align:start position:0%
uh there'd be no further questions thank
 
02:41:38.309 --> 02:41:38.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:39.670 --> 02:41:39.680 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else here wishing to
 
02:41:41.270 --> 02:41:41.280 align:start position:0%

02:41:41.280 --> 02:41:43.590 align:start position:0%
testify on this bill who has not yet
testified

02:41:43.590 --> 02:41:43.600 align:start position:0%

here being done i will now close the
 
02:41:47.590 --> 02:41:47.600 align:start position:0%
public hearing on this bill
 
02:41:50.630 --> 02:41:50.640 align:start position:0%
and the committee will be in recess
 
02:41:56.950 --> 02:41:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:56.960 --> 04:44:53.670 align:start position:0%
 
145.

04:44:53.670 --> 04:44:53.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:53.680 --> 04:44:54.470 align:start position:0%
 
on

04:44:54.470 --> 04:44:54.480 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:45:06.390 --> 04:45:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:08.708 --> 04:45:08.718 align:start position:0%
afternoon mr chairman and members of the
 
04:45:10.868 --> 04:45:10.878 align:start position:0%
house criminal justice committee for the
 
04:45:13.350 --> 04:45:13.360 align:start position:0%
record my name is sharon carson and i
 
04:45:15.270 --> 04:45:15.280 align:start position:0%
have the pleasure of representing senate
 
04:45:17.910 --> 04:45:17.920 align:start position:0%
district 14 comprising the towns of
 
04:45:20.628 --> 04:45:20.638 align:start position:0%
londonderry hudson and auburn and i have
 
04:45:22.628 --> 04:45:22.638 align:start position:0%
for your consideration this afternoon
 
04:45:24.708 --> 04:45:24.718 align:start position:0%
senate bill 222
 
04:45:24.718 --> 04:45:25.510 align:start position:0%
senate bill 222
which

04:45:25.510 --> 04:45:25.520 align:start position:0%
which
 
04:45:27.270 --> 04:45:27.280 align:start position:0%
addresses the elements required for
 
04:45:31.030 --> 04:45:31.040 align:start position:0%
charging a felony or misdemeanor escape
 
04:45:33.510 --> 04:45:33.520 align:start position:0%
this bill was amended um
 
04:45:34.708 --> 04:45:34.718 align:start position:0%
when a
 
04:45:37.430 --> 04:45:37.440 align:start position:0%
house a senate judiciary had it and it
 
04:45:40.070 --> 04:45:40.080 align:start position:0%
amends the penalty for escape and this
 
04:45:41.590 --> 04:45:41.600 align:start position:0%
was a request of the department of
 
04:45:41.600 --> 04:45:42.708 align:start position:0%
was a request of the department of
corrections

04:45:42.708 --> 04:45:42.718 align:start position:0%
corrections
 
04:45:45.670 --> 04:45:45.680 align:start position:0%
a change in the statute in 2015 hindered
 
04:45:48.470 --> 04:45:48.480 align:start position:0%
the state's ability to consistently or
 
04:45:50.788 --> 04:45:50.798 align:start position:0%
successfully prosecute individuals that
 
04:45:53.110 --> 04:45:53.120 align:start position:0%
escape from state facilities
 
04:45:55.430 --> 04:45:55.440 align:start position:0%
this bill as amended corrects that issue
 
04:45:57.830 --> 04:45:57.840 align:start position:0%
moving forward enacting clear and
 
04:45:59.830 --> 04:45:59.840 align:start position:0%
appropriate lines about the penalties
 
04:46:01.910 --> 04:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
that are in place when an individual
 
04:46:05.350 --> 04:46:05.360 align:start position:0%
escapes whether or not force is used
 
04:46:07.590 --> 04:46:07.600 align:start position:0%
and again this language was a compromise
 
04:46:09.190 --> 04:46:09.200 align:start position:0%
between the department of corrections
 
04:46:11.430 --> 04:46:11.440 align:start position:0%
and law enforcement to address concerns
 
04:46:13.350 --> 04:46:13.360 align:start position:0%
that were raised
 
04:46:15.670 --> 04:46:15.680 align:start position:0%
mr chairman at this time i will conclude
 
04:46:18.390 --> 04:46:18.400 align:start position:0%
my testimony there are individuals from
 
04:46:20.230 --> 04:46:20.240 align:start position:0%

04:48:09.110 --> 04:48:09.120 align:start position:0%
why this is important for the new
 
04:48:11.030 --> 04:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire department of corrections what
 
04:48:13.590 --> 04:48:13.600 align:start position:0%
we have seen since 2015 when there was
 
04:48:15.430 --> 04:48:15.440 align:start position:0%
an amendment to the bill
 
04:48:18.470 --> 04:48:18.480 align:start position:0%
is an issue with
 
04:48:20.310 --> 04:48:20.320 align:start position:0%
any county prosecutor wanting to
 
04:48:22.948 --> 04:48:22.958 align:start position:0%
prosecute an escape from one of our
 
04:48:22.958 --> 04:48:24.788 align:start position:0%
prosecute an escape from one of our
facilities

04:48:24.788 --> 04:48:24.798 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
04:48:27.910 --> 04:48:27.920 align:start position:0%
in that the penalty for an escape where
 
04:48:31.750 --> 04:48:31.760 align:start position:0%
there is no force or injury used or
 
04:48:33.670 --> 04:48:33.680 align:start position:0%
excuse me no force used or injury
 
04:48:36.390 --> 04:48:36.400 align:start position:0%
sustained so the person or others that
 
04:48:38.868 --> 04:48:38.878 align:start position:0%
were escaping
 
04:48:40.550 --> 04:48:40.560 align:start position:0%
is a misdemeanor
 
04:48:40.560 --> 04:48:41.430 align:start position:0%
is a misdemeanor
and

04:48:41.430 --> 04:48:41.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:48:43.510 --> 04:48:43.520 align:start position:0%
in a misdemeanor we have someone for
 
04:48:45.670 --> 04:48:45.680 align:start position:0%
example that might walk away from one of
 
04:48:48.150 --> 04:48:48.160 align:start position:0%
our halfway houses and go on a crime
 
04:48:48.160 --> 04:48:49.110 align:start position:0%
our halfway houses and go on a crime
spree

04:48:49.110 --> 04:48:49.120 align:start position:0%
spree
 
04:48:50.788 --> 04:48:50.798 align:start position:0%
now they could be picked up and
 
04:48:53.910 --> 04:48:53.920 align:start position:0%
certainly charged with those crimes from
 
04:48:56.948 --> 04:48:56.958 align:start position:0%
the crime spree but they would only be
 
04:48:59.270 --> 04:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
facing a one-year
 
04:49:02.390 --> 04:49:02.400 align:start position:0%
sentence on the escape
 
04:49:05.030 --> 04:49:05.040 align:start position:0%
in that it's only a misdemeanor and what
 
04:49:07.990 --> 04:49:08.000 align:start position:0%
county prosecutors do sometimes is they
 
04:49:11.110 --> 04:49:11.120 align:start position:0%
they just don't bring those charges or
 
04:49:13.270 --> 04:49:13.280 align:start position:0%
they'll bring the charge get a
 
04:49:16.150 --> 04:49:16.160 align:start position:0%
conviction but the sentence is stand
 
04:49:17.990 --> 04:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
committed time
 
04:49:19.830 --> 04:49:19.840 align:start position:0%
it's not an additional
 
04:49:22.788 --> 04:49:22.798 align:start position:0%
sanction on top of whatever else they're
 
04:49:24.788 --> 04:49:24.798 align:start position:0%
serving so it doesn't serve as a
 
04:49:27.750 --> 04:49:27.760 align:start position:0%
deterrent to individuals from
 
04:49:30.550 --> 04:49:30.560 align:start position:0%
leaving the halfway house or even
 
04:49:32.628 --> 04:49:32.638 align:start position:0%
administrative home confinement and not
 
04:49:34.628 --> 04:49:34.638 align:start position:0%
checking back in
 
04:49:36.628 --> 04:49:36.638 align:start position:0%
we can't necessarily on that individual
 
04:49:39.110 --> 04:49:39.120 align:start position:0%
that doesn't have a crime spree that's
 
04:49:41.270 --> 04:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
committed while they're absconded from
 
04:49:43.510 --> 04:49:43.520 align:start position:0%
our jurisdiction or from our our
 
04:49:43.520 --> 04:49:44.948 align:start position:0%
our jurisdiction or from our our
security

04:49:44.948 --> 04:49:44.958 align:start position:0%
security
 
04:49:47.190 --> 04:49:47.200 align:start position:0%
we if they don't do that there's no
 
04:49:50.150 --> 04:49:50.160 align:start position:0%
charge that is then associated with it
 
04:49:53.190 --> 04:49:53.200 align:start position:0%
because again county prosecutors are
 
04:49:56.550 --> 04:49:56.560 align:start position:0%
reluctant to bring any additional charge
 
04:49:59.590 --> 04:49:59.600 align:start position:0%
when it's only a misdemeanor
 
04:50:01.510 --> 04:50:01.520 align:start position:0%
where this becomes
 
04:50:03.030 --> 04:50:03.040 align:start position:0%
critical to us
 
04:50:05.910 --> 04:50:05.920 align:start position:0%
is when it's not just the halfway house
 
04:50:08.628 --> 04:50:08.638 align:start position:0%
but when it is somebody that escapes
 
04:50:10.470 --> 04:50:10.480 align:start position:0%
from potentially behind the walls
 
04:50:13.830 --> 04:50:13.840 align:start position:0%
without using force and if i can bring
 
04:50:15.670 --> 04:50:15.680 align:start position:0%
you back to a time
 
04:50:17.510 --> 04:50:17.520 align:start position:0%
and many of you may have seen the movie
 
04:50:20.550 --> 04:50:20.560 align:start position:0%
or which is a real life documentary on
 
04:50:23.670 --> 04:50:23.680 align:start position:0%
the escape from denmara which is a new
 
04:50:26.150 --> 04:50:26.160 align:start position:0%
york facility a clinton correctional
 
04:50:28.310 --> 04:50:28.320 align:start position:0%
facility in new york state where two
 
04:50:31.750 --> 04:50:31.760 align:start position:0%
individuals escaped from that facility
 
04:50:33.990 --> 04:50:34.000 align:start position:0%
without using force they dug through
 
04:50:35.910 --> 04:50:35.920 align:start position:0%
tunnels and this was just
 
04:50:41.590 --> 04:50:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:45.030 --> 04:50:45.040 align:start position:0%
tunnels where the heating system went
 
04:50:46.708 --> 04:50:46.718 align:start position:0%
through and came out on the other side
 
04:50:49.510 --> 04:50:49.520 align:start position:0%
of the facility up through a manhole
 
04:50:51.910 --> 04:50:51.920 align:start position:0%
now if that was new hampshire and that's
 
04:50:54.070 --> 04:50:54.080 align:start position:0%
all that happened those individuals
 
04:50:55.430 --> 04:50:55.440 align:start position:0%
would only have been charged with a
 
04:50:55.440 --> 04:50:57.030 align:start position:0%
would only have been charged with a
misdemeanor

04:50:57.030 --> 04:50:57.040 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor
 
04:50:59.190 --> 04:50:59.200 align:start position:0%
that's a concern that there is no
 
04:51:04.230 --> 04:51:04.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:07.830 --> 04:51:07.840 align:start position:0%
this wasn't a problem until 2015 and in
 
04:51:10.708 --> 04:51:10.718 align:start position:0%
2015 the statute changed to only make it
 
04:51:12.628 --> 04:51:12.638 align:start position:0%
a misdemeanor it used to be a class b
 
04:51:15.750 --> 04:51:15.760 align:start position:0%
felony if there was no force used in
 
04:51:15.760 --> 04:51:17.910 align:start position:0%
felony if there was no force used in
2015

04:51:17.910 --> 04:51:17.920 align:start position:0%
2015
 
04:51:20.628 --> 04:51:20.638 align:start position:0%
the legislative history shows that an
 
04:51:23.750 --> 04:51:23.760 align:start position:0%
individual who was arrested a young
 
04:51:27.190 --> 04:51:27.200 align:start position:0%
woman arrested fleeing a
 
04:51:29.270 --> 04:51:29.280 align:start position:0%
party where she was under
 
04:51:32.708 --> 04:51:32.718 align:start position:0%
21 that had beer at the party
 
04:51:35.430 --> 04:51:35.440 align:start position:0%
was charged with an escape from that
 
04:51:35.440 --> 04:51:36.628 align:start position:0%
was charged with an escape from that
detention

04:51:36.628 --> 04:51:36.638 align:start position:0%
detention
 
04:51:39.750 --> 04:51:39.760 align:start position:0%
and was charged with that class b felony
 
04:51:41.750 --> 04:51:41.760 align:start position:0%
and people
 
04:51:43.670 --> 04:51:43.680 align:start position:0%
were concerned that that type of
 
04:51:46.628 --> 04:51:46.638 align:start position:0%
behavior would lead someone to a class b
 
04:51:50.470 --> 04:51:50.480 align:start position:0%
having a sentence of a class b felony
 
04:51:52.868 --> 04:51:52.878 align:start position:0%
we were trying to rectify that working
 
04:51:54.948 --> 04:51:54.958 align:start position:0%
with law enforcement to the bill that
 
04:51:57.750 --> 04:51:57.760 align:start position:0%
you see today so that it is a class b
 
04:52:00.390 --> 04:52:00.400 align:start position:0%
felony for those individuals that are
 
04:52:02.628 --> 04:52:02.638 align:start position:0%
previously sentenced and incarcerated
 
04:52:07.590 --> 04:52:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:09.350 --> 04:52:09.360 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions
 
04:52:11.750 --> 04:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
04:52:14.310 --> 04:52:14.320 align:start position:0%
question uh from the chair it would seem
 
04:52:15.910 --> 04:52:15.920 align:start position:0%
also that
 
04:52:19.030 --> 04:52:19.040 align:start position:0%
if you were to pursue
 
04:52:21.350 --> 04:52:21.360 align:start position:0%
somebody who was escaping
 
04:52:23.270 --> 04:52:23.280 align:start position:0%
you're not allowed to cross state lines
 
04:52:25.030 --> 04:52:25.040 align:start position:0%
to pursue for a misdemeanor but you are
 
04:52:27.430 --> 04:52:27.440 align:start position:0%
for a felony so technically is it not
 
04:52:28.868 --> 04:52:28.878 align:start position:0%
true that you'd actually have to stop at
 
04:52:30.550 --> 04:52:30.560 align:start position:0%
the vermont border and watch them
 
04:52:32.470 --> 04:52:32.480 align:start position:0%
continue on into the sunrise that is
 
04:52:35.270 --> 04:52:35.280 align:start position:0%
correct and and it's also difficult for
 
04:52:37.990 --> 04:52:38.000 align:start position:0%
a misdemeanor to get a warrant out of
 
04:52:39.190 --> 04:52:39.200 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
04:52:41.830 --> 04:52:41.840 align:start position:0%
for new england we had an individual for
 
04:52:41.840 --> 04:52:43.030 align:start position:0%
for new england we had an individual for
example

04:52:43.030 --> 04:52:43.040 align:start position:0%
example
 
04:52:46.150 --> 04:52:46.160 align:start position:0%
that walked away from our halfway house
 
04:52:49.350 --> 04:52:49.360 align:start position:0%
went to all the way to virginia
 
04:52:51.750 --> 04:52:51.760 align:start position:0%
his and it's in the testimony his
 
04:52:53.910 --> 04:52:53.920 align:start position:0%
girlfriend helped him by
 
04:52:56.708 --> 04:52:56.718 align:start position:0%
renting a car for him by running a hotel
 
04:52:58.948 --> 04:52:58.958 align:start position:0%
the first night by producing getting a
 
04:53:00.310 --> 04:53:00.320 align:start position:0%
weapon for him
 
04:53:02.788 --> 04:53:02.798 align:start position:0%
and at first we could not get that
 
04:53:05.430 --> 04:53:05.440 align:start position:0%
warrant new england wide
 
04:53:08.310 --> 04:53:08.320 align:start position:0%
and then east coast wide it took some
 
04:53:10.150 --> 04:53:10.160 align:start position:0%
doing to finally be able to get that
 
04:53:10.160 --> 04:53:11.270 align:start position:0%
doing to finally be able to get that
warrant

04:53:11.270 --> 04:53:11.280 align:start position:0%
warrant
 
04:53:13.910 --> 04:53:13.920 align:start position:0%
because it was only a misdemeanor where
 
04:53:16.310 --> 04:53:16.320 align:start position:0%
there was no force that was used
 
04:53:17.990 --> 04:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:53:19.590 --> 04:53:19.600 align:start position:0%
any other questions okay uh
 
04:53:21.350 --> 04:53:21.360 align:start position:0%
representative burt
 
04:53:23.830 --> 04:53:23.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh thank you
 
04:53:23.840 --> 04:53:24.948 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh thank you

uh
 
04:53:27.590 --> 04:53:27.600 align:start position:0%
you brought up dana mora
 
04:53:30.788 --> 04:53:30.798 align:start position:0%
now when those two broke out with
 
04:53:34.390 --> 04:53:34.400 align:start position:0%
assistance from prison staff
 
04:53:34.400 --> 04:53:36.310 align:start position:0%
assistance from prison staff
um

04:53:36.310 --> 04:53:36.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:53:38.390 --> 04:53:38.400 align:start position:0%
what what would the fine be over there i
 
04:53:39.910 --> 04:53:39.920 align:start position:0%
know that i think both of them ended up
 
04:53:42.948 --> 04:53:42.958 align:start position:0%
dead um but one did one did not one's
 
04:53:45.190 --> 04:53:45.200 align:start position:0%
back did survive yes one's back in the
 
04:53:45.200 --> 04:53:46.550 align:start position:0%
back did survive yes one's back in the
facility

04:53:46.550 --> 04:53:46.560 align:start position:0%
facility
 
04:53:48.390 --> 04:53:48.400 align:start position:0%
what would the crime been there would
 
04:53:50.230 --> 04:53:50.240 align:start position:0%
have been a felony or was it a
 
04:53:52.708 --> 04:53:52.718 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor it was a a felony for the
 
04:53:55.190 --> 04:53:55.200 align:start position:0%
escape and then obviously
 
04:53:58.150 --> 04:53:58.160 align:start position:0%
um that one that died he did
 
04:54:01.030 --> 04:54:01.040 align:start position:0%
shoot at state police um during the time
 
04:54:02.390 --> 04:54:02.400 align:start position:0%
so there were other
 
04:54:04.470 --> 04:54:04.480 align:start position:0%
crimes that were committed the one that
 
04:54:07.350 --> 04:54:07.360 align:start position:0%
was brought back in was only on the run
 
04:54:09.110 --> 04:54:09.120 align:start position:0%
or on the lamb
 
04:54:11.110 --> 04:54:11.120 align:start position:0%
so-called on the lamp for that period of
 
04:54:13.910 --> 04:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
time and had a felony escape charge when
 
04:54:18.948 --> 04:54:18.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:20.550 --> 04:54:20.560 align:start position:0%
representative gasser did you have a
 
04:54:23.350 --> 04:54:23.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:25.590 --> 04:54:25.600 align:start position:0%
yes thank you thank you for taking my
 
04:54:28.070 --> 04:54:28.080 align:start position:0%
question um i was just observing but i
 
04:54:30.310 --> 04:54:30.320 align:start position:0%
didn't read this whole chapter here but
 
04:54:33.110 --> 04:54:33.120 align:start position:0%
in line six when it talks about juvenile
 
04:54:34.788 --> 04:54:34.798 align:start position:0%
correction facility
 
04:54:38.788 --> 04:54:38.798 align:start position:0%
is that current and current law correct
 
04:54:41.190 --> 04:54:41.200 align:start position:0%
i was just surprised to read juvenile
 
04:54:44.070 --> 04:54:44.080 align:start position:0%
yes that's already in in law there's no
 
04:54:46.230 --> 04:54:46.240 align:start position:0%
change to that it's just the phrase
 
04:54:47.350 --> 04:54:47.360 align:start position:0%
before it
 
04:54:49.910 --> 04:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
um where we inserted regat regardless of
 
04:54:52.550 --> 04:54:52.560 align:start position:0%
whether force is used
 
04:54:54.788 --> 04:54:54.798 align:start position:0%
so current law reads the offense is a
 
04:54:57.190 --> 04:54:57.200 align:start position:0%
class b felony if the actor was on
 
04:54:59.990 --> 04:55:00.000 align:start position:0%
parole and it's that last line
 
04:55:02.868 --> 04:55:02.878 align:start position:0%
um because
 
04:55:04.230 --> 04:55:04.240 align:start position:0%
of the
 
04:55:06.230 --> 04:55:06.240 align:start position:0%
entire section
 
04:55:08.788 --> 04:55:08.798 align:start position:0%
where in where it says if no physical
 
04:55:11.270 --> 04:55:11.280 align:start position:0%
force was used it is a class
 
04:55:14.550 --> 04:55:14.560 align:start position:0%
a misdemeanor and that's where the
 
04:55:16.708 --> 04:55:16.718 align:start position:0%
county attorneys are saying without the
 
04:55:19.350 --> 04:55:19.360 align:start position:0%
language that you that we've asked for
 
04:55:21.750 --> 04:55:21.760 align:start position:0%
they will only ever prosecute it as a
 
04:55:26.070 --> 04:55:26.080 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor when no force is used
 
04:55:29.350 --> 04:55:29.360 align:start position:0%
so the language um regardless of whether
 
04:55:32.070 --> 04:55:32.080 align:start position:0%
force is used
 
04:55:34.708 --> 04:55:34.718 align:start position:0%
corrects that that dichotomy that would
 
04:55:34.718 --> 04:55:38.628 align:start position:0%
corrects that that dichotomy that would
exist

04:55:38.628 --> 04:55:38.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:40.868 --> 04:55:40.878 align:start position:0%
representative expedia
 
04:55:42.708 --> 04:55:42.718 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um and thank you for
 
04:55:44.948 --> 04:55:44.958 align:start position:0%
taking my question how often do do
 
04:55:47.350 --> 04:55:47.360 align:start position:0%
escapes happen in our in our facilities
 
04:55:49.670 --> 04:55:49.680 align:start position:0%
certainly so in the last five years we
 
04:55:53.190 --> 04:55:53.200 align:start position:0%
have had 30 walk-aways now those so it's
 
04:55:55.750 --> 04:55:55.760 align:start position:0%
about five to six a year
 
04:55:59.750 --> 04:55:59.760 align:start position:0%
those walkaways range from anything to
 
04:56:01.590 --> 04:56:01.600 align:start position:0%
gone a number of hours
 
04:56:04.470 --> 04:56:04.480 align:start position:0%
to gone in one case the one case where i
 
04:56:06.550 --> 04:56:06.560 align:start position:0%
mentioned the individual in virginia
 
04:56:10.550 --> 04:56:10.560 align:start position:0%
three months there was a another month
 
04:56:12.390 --> 04:56:12.400 align:start position:0%
where an individual walked away from one
 
04:56:15.350 --> 04:56:15.360 align:start position:0%
of our halfway houses got a ride with
 
04:56:15.360 --> 04:56:16.470 align:start position:0%
of our halfway houses got a ride with
again

04:56:16.470 --> 04:56:16.480 align:start position:0%
again
 
04:56:19.590 --> 04:56:19.600 align:start position:0%
a girlfriend the girlfriend and he
 
04:56:21.990 --> 04:56:22.000 align:start position:0%
made their way through atlantic city
 
04:56:25.190 --> 04:56:25.200 align:start position:0%
down to tennessee and into texas and it
 
04:56:25.200 --> 04:56:25.910 align:start position:0%
down to tennessee and into texas and it
was

04:56:25.910 --> 04:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
was
 
04:56:28.390 --> 04:56:28.400 align:start position:0%
almost a month before we brought that
 
04:56:33.670 --> 04:56:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:34.628 --> 04:56:34.638 align:start position:0%
at a
 
04:56:37.910 --> 04:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
at a good cost too to
 
04:56:41.990 --> 04:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
to try to to get them back here
 
04:56:44.948 --> 04:56:44.958 align:start position:0%
um question for the chi from the chair
 
04:56:46.708 --> 04:56:46.718 align:start position:0%
people on an electronic monitoring
 
04:56:49.270 --> 04:56:49.280 align:start position:0%
bracelet um would it constitute an
 
04:56:51.990 --> 04:56:52.000 align:start position:0%
escape if they were to cut that off and
 
04:56:52.000 --> 04:56:52.788 align:start position:0%
escape if they were to cut that off and
leave

04:56:52.788 --> 04:56:52.798 align:start position:0%
leave
 
04:56:55.190 --> 04:56:55.200 align:start position:0%
yes so that's what we're saying and here
 
04:56:57.110 --> 04:56:57.120 align:start position:0%
anybody that what we say is that
 
04:56:59.670 --> 04:56:59.680 align:start position:0%
administrative home confinement somebody
 
04:57:01.750 --> 04:57:01.760 align:start position:0%
that is has that electronic monitoring
 
04:57:05.030 --> 04:57:05.040 align:start position:0%
bracelet we have had a case of that
 
04:57:07.430 --> 04:57:07.440 align:start position:0%
sort where the individual
 
04:57:10.470 --> 04:57:10.480 align:start position:0%
we say absconded it's an escape
 
04:57:13.030 --> 04:57:13.040 align:start position:0%
cut their bracelet off it sent warnings
 
04:57:16.070 --> 04:57:16.080 align:start position:0%
that it was off we went to find them
 
04:57:17.830 --> 04:57:17.840 align:start position:0%
could not find him did some
 
04:57:20.708 --> 04:57:20.718 align:start position:0%
investigation um he had
 
04:57:23.350 --> 04:57:23.360 align:start position:0%
left and was in massachusetts with
 
04:57:27.190 --> 04:57:27.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:28.948 --> 04:57:28.958 align:start position:0%
representative burke
 
04:57:31.430 --> 04:57:31.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman you brought up a
 
04:57:33.510 --> 04:57:33.520 align:start position:0%
you know a question in my head
 
04:57:33.520 --> 04:57:35.030 align:start position:0%
you know a question in my head
if

04:57:35.030 --> 04:57:35.040 align:start position:0%
if
 
04:57:37.670 --> 04:57:37.680 align:start position:0%
to have home confinement can
 
04:57:39.670 --> 04:57:39.680 align:start position:0%
you couldn't be you know charged with a
 
04:57:42.550 --> 04:57:42.560 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor and be home
 
04:57:44.788 --> 04:57:44.798 align:start position:0%
on an ankle brace that can you
 
04:57:48.310 --> 04:57:48.320 align:start position:0%
i believe the statute in 651 i think it
 
04:57:49.590 --> 04:57:49.600 align:start position:0%
is 18
 
04:57:52.788 --> 04:57:52.798 align:start position:0%
allows the county facility to allow to
 
04:57:55.110 --> 04:57:55.120 align:start position:0%
send people out on administrative home
 
04:57:59.110 --> 04:57:59.120 align:start position:0%
confinement with an ankle bracelet yes
 
04:58:01.430 --> 04:58:01.440 align:start position:0%
criminal sentencing with a felony
 
04:58:04.948 --> 04:58:04.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:07.670 --> 04:58:07.680 align:start position:0%
that they have been of good behavior
 
04:58:09.430 --> 04:58:09.440 align:start position:0%
and we have to get court approval to
 
04:58:11.110 --> 04:58:11.120 align:start position:0%
allow that administrative home
 
04:58:13.350 --> 04:58:13.360 align:start position:0%
confinement to occur a little different
 
04:58:15.430 --> 04:58:15.440 align:start position:0%
for the county facilities
 
04:58:15.440 --> 04:58:16.470 align:start position:0%
for the county facilities
follow-up

04:58:16.470 --> 04:58:16.480 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
04:58:17.590 --> 04:58:17.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:58:19.350 --> 04:58:19.360 align:start position:0%
so somebody with a misdemeanor could be
 
04:58:21.350 --> 04:58:21.360 align:start position:0%
home with an ankle bracelet and if they
 
04:58:25.670 --> 04:58:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:29.750 --> 04:58:29.760 align:start position:0%
good question i i'm not certain of that
 
04:58:29.760 --> 04:58:33.590 align:start position:0%
good question i i'm not certain of that
um

04:58:33.590 --> 04:58:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:40.390 --> 04:58:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:42.390 --> 04:58:42.400 align:start position:0%
that they would be a consider they could
 
04:58:44.708 --> 04:58:44.718 align:start position:0%
be charged with that class b felony for
 
04:58:46.390 --> 04:58:46.400 align:start position:0%
absconding from
 
04:58:48.550 --> 04:58:48.560 align:start position:0%
from administrative home confinement yes
 
04:58:56.948 --> 04:58:56.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:00.788 --> 04:59:00.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:03.430 --> 04:59:03.440 align:start position:0%
thank you um in the in in the new york
 
04:59:05.830 --> 04:59:05.840 align:start position:0%
case um
 
04:59:07.670 --> 04:59:07.680 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that the two
 
04:59:09.750 --> 04:59:09.760 align:start position:0%
offenders are being held for very
 
04:59:12.310 --> 04:59:12.320 align:start position:0%
serious charges what i what i don't
 
04:59:15.430 --> 04:59:15.440 align:start position:0%
understand if if we look at the 30 folks
 
04:59:17.510 --> 04:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
that have uh that have affected escapes
 
04:59:19.430 --> 04:59:19.440 align:start position:0%
over the last five years
 
04:59:19.440 --> 04:59:20.470 align:start position:0%
over the last five years
um

04:59:20.470 --> 04:59:20.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:59:21.910 --> 04:59:21.920 align:start position:0%
what are the what are the charges like
 
04:59:23.350 --> 04:59:23.360 align:start position:0%
and where are they escaping from are
 
04:59:24.948 --> 04:59:24.958 align:start position:0%
most of them
 
04:59:27.030 --> 04:59:27.040 align:start position:0%
convicted of fairly minor charges
 
04:59:29.670 --> 04:59:29.680 align:start position:0%
walking away from halfway houses or
 
04:59:31.590 --> 04:59:31.600 align:start position:0%
are we talking about
 
04:59:33.750 --> 04:59:33.760 align:start position:0%
serious felons escaping
 
04:59:35.750 --> 04:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
from prison facilities
 
04:59:38.948 --> 04:59:38.958 align:start position:0%
so of those 30 that i have um told you
 
04:59:41.190 --> 04:59:41.200 align:start position:0%
about in the last five years none of
 
04:59:43.670 --> 04:59:43.680 align:start position:0%
them were from behind the walls of our
 
04:59:46.150 --> 04:59:46.160 align:start position:0%
of our prison they were all from either
 
04:59:48.788 --> 04:59:48.798 align:start position:0%
the temporary the excuse me transitional
 
04:59:50.868 --> 04:59:50.878 align:start position:0%
housing unit or th you
 
04:59:52.550 --> 04:59:52.560 align:start position:0%
or a
 
04:59:55.990 --> 04:59:56.000 align:start position:0%
temporary work center the twc so th us
 
04:59:57.750 --> 04:59:57.760 align:start position:0%
would include calumet house down in
 
04:59:59.990 --> 05:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
manchester where we see
 
05:00:01.430 --> 05:00:01.440 align:start position:0%
quite a few
 
05:00:02.390 --> 05:00:02.400 align:start position:0%
and i'll
 
05:00:04.708 --> 05:00:04.718 align:start position:0%
explain what those are and potentially
 
05:00:07.430 --> 05:00:07.440 align:start position:0%
who those people could be our shae farm
 
05:00:09.750 --> 05:00:09.760 align:start position:0%
which is our women's halfway house
 
05:00:11.190 --> 05:00:11.200 align:start position:0%
we have no
 
05:00:13.350 --> 05:00:13.360 align:start position:0%
walk aways from shea farm
 
05:00:14.708 --> 05:00:14.718 align:start position:0%
i guess
 
05:00:18.470 --> 05:00:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:21.110 --> 05:00:21.120 align:start position:0%
and north end house is another
 
05:00:23.590 --> 05:00:23.600 align:start position:0%
thu transitional housing unit right next
 
05:00:25.750 --> 05:00:25.760 align:start position:0%
to the prison in concord we've had a few
 
05:00:28.788 --> 05:00:28.798 align:start position:0%
from there and then the temporary
 
05:00:30.788 --> 05:00:30.798 align:start position:0%
transitional work center
 
05:00:33.270 --> 05:00:33.280 align:start position:0%
which is next to the north end house
 
05:00:37.350 --> 05:00:37.360 align:start position:0%
they are individuals that are not
 
05:00:40.310 --> 05:00:40.320 align:start position:0%
clas or classified as c
 
05:00:42.788 --> 05:00:42.798 align:start position:0%
they are c2s still they are not
 
05:00:45.430 --> 05:00:45.440 align:start position:0%
classified as c1 being our lowest
 
05:00:48.868 --> 05:00:48.878 align:start position:0%
classification level minimum security
 
05:00:51.510 --> 05:00:51.520 align:start position:0%
and they work for example you might see
 
05:00:53.670 --> 05:00:53.680 align:start position:0%
them if you drive along main street you
 
05:00:56.948 --> 05:00:56.958 align:start position:0%
might see them wearing the orange vests
 
05:00:59.510 --> 05:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
cleaning parking lots or walking up to
 
05:01:03.350 --> 05:01:03.360 align:start position:0%
the farm or the
 
05:01:05.910 --> 05:01:05.920 align:start position:0%
walking to the
 
05:01:08.550 --> 05:01:08.560 align:start position:0%
shop where we sell in industries
 
05:01:11.350 --> 05:01:11.360 align:start position:0%
products they work in those locations
 
05:01:12.868 --> 05:01:12.878 align:start position:0%
and what happens
 
05:01:14.788 --> 05:01:14.798 align:start position:0%
on one occasion
 
05:01:17.750 --> 05:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
we know that somebody left the twc to
 
05:01:19.030 --> 05:01:19.040 align:start position:0%
walk up there
 
05:01:22.550 --> 05:01:22.560 align:start position:0%
a car met them we had some advanced
 
05:01:24.310 --> 05:01:24.320 align:start position:0%
notice because of phone calls that we
 
05:01:27.190 --> 05:01:27.200 align:start position:0%
were listening to and were able to stop
 
05:01:29.110 --> 05:01:29.120 align:start position:0%
that person before they
 
05:01:29.120 --> 05:01:30.470 align:start position:0%
that person before they
absconded

05:01:30.470 --> 05:01:30.480 align:start position:0%
absconded
 
05:01:32.788 --> 05:01:32.798 align:start position:0%
in other cases we don't have that
 
05:01:34.550 --> 05:01:34.560 align:start position:0%
good intelligence or advanced notice and
 
05:01:37.110 --> 05:01:37.120 align:start position:0%
they may get in that car and and drive
 
05:01:40.390 --> 05:01:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:42.390 --> 05:01:42.400 align:start position:0%
those individuals could
 
05:01:42.400 --> 05:01:43.190 align:start position:0%
those individuals could
be

05:01:43.190 --> 05:01:43.200 align:start position:0%
be
 
05:01:45.510 --> 05:01:45.520 align:start position:0%
um charged with
 
05:01:48.150 --> 05:01:48.160 align:start position:0%
murder and are now
 
05:01:49.030 --> 05:01:49.040 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:01:51.590 --> 05:01:51.600 align:start position:0%
they were serving a 30-year sentence say
 
05:01:53.990 --> 05:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
they're now two years outside they've
 
05:01:56.550 --> 05:01:56.560 align:start position:0%
served 28 years
 
05:01:58.310 --> 05:01:58.320 align:start position:0%
to have two years left and they could
 
05:02:01.030 --> 05:02:01.040 align:start position:0%
walk away they could be someone that is
 
05:02:03.190 --> 05:02:03.200 align:start position:0%
a sexual predator um
 
05:02:04.550 --> 05:02:04.560 align:start position:0%
they could be somebody just with
 
05:02:07.750 --> 05:02:07.760 align:start position:0%
substance abuse issues and and um
 
05:02:10.310 --> 05:02:10.320 align:start position:0%
we're charged with um
 
05:02:13.030 --> 05:02:13.040 align:start position:0%
controlled drug possession
 
05:02:16.470 --> 05:02:16.480 align:start position:0%
so it's the gambit of individuals
 
05:02:19.670 --> 05:02:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:22.150 --> 05:02:22.160 align:start position:0%
representative welch
 
05:02:23.990 --> 05:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
05:02:25.990 --> 05:02:26.000 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
05:02:28.070 --> 05:02:28.080 align:start position:0%
a number of years ago
 
05:02:29.910 --> 05:02:29.920 align:start position:0%
there was two people who escaped from
 
05:02:31.590 --> 05:02:31.600 align:start position:0%
the prison
 
05:02:33.750 --> 05:02:33.760 align:start position:0%
and i think one of them ended up dead
 
05:02:36.390 --> 05:02:36.400 align:start position:0%
and the fellow who
 
05:02:39.670 --> 05:02:39.680 align:start position:0%
helped him out he committed suicide
 
05:02:41.750 --> 05:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
but we did an investigation of that we
 
05:02:44.788 --> 05:02:44.798 align:start position:0%
found out that the guards and the towers
 
05:02:47.830 --> 05:02:47.840 align:start position:0%
had no ammunition in their firearms
 
05:02:51.910 --> 05:02:51.920 align:start position:0%
do you know if that has been corrected
 
05:02:54.390 --> 05:02:54.400 align:start position:0%
unfortunately i cannot i don't know the
 
05:02:56.708 --> 05:02:56.718 align:start position:0%
status of the weapons that they when
 
05:02:59.590 --> 05:02:59.600 align:start position:0%
they're in the towers
 
05:03:01.350 --> 05:03:01.360 align:start position:0%
i i don't even want to make an
 
05:03:03.270 --> 05:03:03.280 align:start position:0%
assumption to you i would believe that
 
05:03:05.030 --> 05:03:05.040 align:start position:0%
they have ammunition
 
05:03:07.510 --> 05:03:07.520 align:start position:0%
but i cannot sit here and tell you
 
05:03:09.750 --> 05:03:09.760 align:start position:0%
with 100 certainty that's the case
 
05:03:09.760 --> 05:03:13.110 align:start position:0%
with 100 certainty that's the case
follow-up

05:03:13.110 --> 05:03:13.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:15.270 --> 05:03:15.280 align:start position:0%
during that investigation we also found
 
05:03:15.280 --> 05:03:16.708 align:start position:0%
during that investigation we also found
out

05:03:16.708 --> 05:03:16.718 align:start position:0%
out
 
05:03:18.868 --> 05:03:18.878 align:start position:0%
that they were tipped off about the
 
05:03:18.878 --> 05:03:20.550 align:start position:0%
that they were tipped off about the
escape

05:03:20.550 --> 05:03:20.560 align:start position:0%
escape
 
05:03:23.110 --> 05:03:23.120 align:start position:0%
that they found wire cutters between the
 
05:03:25.270 --> 05:03:25.280 align:start position:0%
fences this is on the
 
05:03:27.110 --> 05:03:27.120 align:start position:0%
north side of the
 
05:03:31.590 --> 05:03:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:33.430 --> 05:03:33.440 align:start position:0%
the the other activity takes place i
 
05:03:36.150 --> 05:03:36.160 align:start position:0%
forget what it is now
 
05:03:36.160 --> 05:03:39.190 align:start position:0%
forget what it is now
but

05:03:39.190 --> 05:03:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:43.030 --> 05:03:43.040 align:start position:0%
they ignored all the tips i i would
 
05:03:45.510 --> 05:03:45.520 align:start position:0%
i'm assuming that we have good
 
05:03:48.470 --> 05:03:48.480 align:start position:0%
investigative material over there
 
05:03:51.910 --> 05:03:51.920 align:start position:0%
so um under my purview as the director
 
05:03:54.070 --> 05:03:54.080 align:start position:0%
of professional standards i do have 14
 
05:03:56.628 --> 05:03:56.638 align:start position:0%
investigators who are very hardworking
 
05:03:56.638 --> 05:03:58.070 align:start position:0%
investigators who are very hardworking
individuals

05:03:58.070 --> 05:03:58.080 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
05:04:01.430 --> 05:04:01.440 align:start position:0%
who listen to phone calls and
 
05:04:04.390 --> 05:04:04.400 align:start position:0%
many times and i would say
 
05:04:06.788 --> 05:04:06.798 align:start position:0%
the majority of the time stop something
 
05:04:08.470 --> 05:04:08.480 align:start position:0%
before it happens
 
05:04:10.868 --> 05:04:10.878 align:start position:0%
there are instances in which the
 
05:04:15.110 --> 05:04:15.120 align:start position:0%
intelligence either is not there or
 
05:04:17.190 --> 05:04:17.200 align:start position:0%
new hampshire has the second largest
 
05:04:21.030 --> 05:04:21.040 align:start position:0%
call volume of any facility meaning
 
05:04:23.430 --> 05:04:23.440 align:start position:0%
their the ability to make phone calls
 
05:04:25.350 --> 05:04:25.360 align:start position:0%
for residents through their tablets or
 
05:04:25.360 --> 05:04:26.390 align:start position:0%
for residents through their tablets or
through

05:04:26.390 --> 05:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
through
 
05:04:28.868 --> 05:04:28.878 align:start position:0%
pay phones of any facility in the
 
05:04:28.878 --> 05:04:30.390 align:start position:0%
pay phones of any facility in the
country

05:04:30.390 --> 05:04:30.400 align:start position:0%
country
 
05:04:32.390 --> 05:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
so we cannot listen to
 
05:04:34.788 --> 05:04:34.798 align:start position:0%
the 30 000 hours of phone calls that
 
05:04:34.798 --> 05:04:35.750 align:start position:0%
the 30 000 hours of phone calls that
occur

05:04:35.750 --> 05:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
occur
 
05:04:38.550 --> 05:04:38.560 align:start position:0%
on a monthly basis
 
05:04:39.670 --> 05:04:39.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:04:43.190 --> 05:04:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:45.190 --> 05:04:45.200 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i think you've taken my
 
05:04:47.830 --> 05:04:47.840 align:start position:0%
question i'm a little
 
05:04:49.350 --> 05:04:49.360 align:start position:0%
puzzled by the
 
05:04:49.360 --> 05:04:50.310 align:start position:0%
puzzled by the
by

05:04:50.310 --> 05:04:50.320 align:start position:0%
by
 
05:04:52.708 --> 05:04:52.718 align:start position:0%
the language in this bill
 
05:04:56.070 --> 05:04:56.080 align:start position:0%
because it says on line for
 
05:04:58.550 --> 05:04:58.560 align:start position:0%
the fence is a class b felony regardless
 
05:05:01.350 --> 05:05:01.360 align:start position:0%
of whether force is used
 
05:05:03.190 --> 05:05:03.200 align:start position:0%
and then on line
 
05:05:05.990 --> 05:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
9 it says in all other cases if no
 
05:05:08.868 --> 05:05:08.878 align:start position:0%
physical force was used by the actor or
 
05:05:10.868 --> 05:05:10.878 align:start position:0%
no persons other than the actors staying
 
05:05:13.030 --> 05:05:13.040 align:start position:0%
body injury
 
05:05:15.910 --> 05:05:15.920 align:start position:0%
the offenses of class b misdemeanor
 
05:05:18.470 --> 05:05:18.480 align:start position:0%
i don't understand
 
05:05:20.788 --> 05:05:20.798 align:start position:0%
so the regardless of whether force is
 
05:05:23.110 --> 05:05:23.120 align:start position:0%
used is modifying the
 
05:05:25.750 --> 05:05:25.760 align:start position:0%
those actors if they were on parole
 
05:05:28.868 --> 05:05:28.878 align:start position:0%
subject to a bail order or a prisoner
 
05:05:30.948 --> 05:05:30.958 align:start position:0%
the in all other cases would be that
 
05:05:33.430 --> 05:05:33.440 align:start position:0%
individual for example that was detained
 
05:05:35.110 --> 05:05:35.120 align:start position:0%
that young woman that i talked about
 
05:05:37.110 --> 05:05:37.120 align:start position:0%
earlier who um
 
05:05:39.590 --> 05:05:39.600 align:start position:0%
was at an under underage at a drinking
 
05:05:39.600 --> 05:05:40.550 align:start position:0%
was at an under underage at a drinking
party

05:05:40.550 --> 05:05:40.560 align:start position:0%
party
 
05:05:42.550 --> 05:05:42.560 align:start position:0%
that would be in that case in all other
 
05:05:44.230 --> 05:05:44.240 align:start position:0%
cases so
 
05:05:47.270 --> 05:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
the qualifier or the modifier is
 
05:05:48.788 --> 05:05:48.798 align:start position:0%
in cases
 
05:05:50.788 --> 05:05:50.798 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether force is used if
 
05:05:52.230 --> 05:05:52.240 align:start position:0%
they were
 
05:05:53.510 --> 05:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
a prisoner
 
05:05:54.868 --> 05:05:54.878 align:start position:0%
a parolee
 
05:05:56.788 --> 05:05:56.798 align:start position:0%
somebody on administrative home can find
 
05:05:56.798 --> 05:05:59.270 align:start position:0%
somebody on administrative home can find
met

05:05:59.270 --> 05:05:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:08.470 --> 05:06:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:13.190 --> 05:06:13.200 align:start position:0%
i think it's poorly written myself i i
 
05:06:13.200 --> 05:06:14.390 align:start position:0%
i think it's poorly written myself i i
i

05:06:14.390 --> 05:06:14.400 align:start position:0%
i
 
05:06:15.910 --> 05:06:15.920 align:start position:0%
is it clear to you
 
05:06:18.070 --> 05:06:18.080 align:start position:0%
so um
 
05:06:21.990 --> 05:06:22.000 align:start position:0%
it is yes um in the sense that we
 
05:06:24.550 --> 05:06:24.560 align:start position:0%
worked with the state police we worked
 
05:06:27.190 --> 05:06:27.200 align:start position:0%
with other law enforcement to make sure
 
05:06:30.390 --> 05:06:30.400 align:start position:0%
that we met the needs of of them through
 
05:06:33.590 --> 05:06:33.600 align:start position:0%
this notion that we're not trying to
 
05:06:38.550 --> 05:06:38.560 align:start position:0%
effectuate a class b felony on anyone
 
05:06:41.430 --> 05:06:41.440 align:start position:0%
other than those individuals that have
 
05:06:43.750 --> 05:06:43.760 align:start position:0%
walked away or escaped from
 
05:06:45.430 --> 05:06:45.440 align:start position:0%
a prison
 
05:06:46.708 --> 05:06:46.718 align:start position:0%
a parolee
 
05:06:49.830 --> 05:06:49.840 align:start position:0%
administrative home confinement
 
05:06:49.840 --> 05:06:51.750 align:start position:0%
administrative home confinement
so

05:06:51.750 --> 05:06:51.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:06:54.310 --> 05:06:54.320 align:start position:0%
yes i guess it does make sense to me
 
05:06:58.070 --> 05:06:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:00.070 --> 05:07:00.080 align:start position:0%
question from the chair in all of the
 
05:07:03.350 --> 05:07:03.360 align:start position:0%
cases would that would that also um
 
05:07:05.910 --> 05:07:05.920 align:start position:0%
apply to arrestees that's exactly my
 
05:07:07.030 --> 05:07:07.040 align:start position:0%
point yes thank you for that
 
05:07:12.150 --> 05:07:12.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:13.510 --> 05:07:13.520 align:start position:0%
representative byrd
 
05:07:16.550 --> 05:07:16.560 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair um i do apologize
 
05:07:18.830 --> 05:07:18.840 align:start position:0%
for three questions and one
 
05:07:20.550 --> 05:07:20.560 align:start position:0%
time um
 
05:07:23.510 --> 05:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
you said that there was 30 approximately
 
05:07:26.230 --> 05:07:26.240 align:start position:0%
30 people is that a year or what was the
 
05:07:29.750 --> 05:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
um in a five year period so five years
 
05:07:32.868 --> 05:07:32.878 align:start position:0%
for example we have had two so far this
 
05:07:35.110 --> 05:07:35.120 align:start position:0%
year where there was a walk away one of
 
05:07:37.350 --> 05:07:37.360 align:start position:0%
them was a for about two hours
 
05:07:40.150 --> 05:07:40.160 align:start position:0%
and in that situation it was somebody
 
05:07:42.470 --> 05:07:42.480 align:start position:0%
that was coming home from a workplace so
 
05:07:45.350 --> 05:07:45.360 align:start position:0%
it as they live in the transitional
 
05:07:48.628 --> 05:07:48.638 align:start position:0%
housing units they go out to
 
05:07:50.310 --> 05:07:50.320 align:start position:0%
many different types of work
 
05:07:52.150 --> 05:07:52.160 align:start position:0%
situations in this case it was a
 
05:07:54.310 --> 05:07:54.320 align:start position:0%
restaurant here in concord
 
05:07:56.628 --> 05:07:56.638 align:start position:0%
they were supposed to report back at a
 
05:07:58.948 --> 05:07:58.958 align:start position:0%
certain time from their shift at the
 
05:08:00.708 --> 05:08:00.718 align:start position:0%
at the restaurant
 
05:08:03.030 --> 05:08:03.040 align:start position:0%
and didn't report back
 
05:08:04.868 --> 05:08:04.878 align:start position:0%
somebody then called my investigator and
 
05:08:06.708 --> 05:08:06.718 align:start position:0%
said it looks like we have an escape or
 
05:08:09.270 --> 05:08:09.280 align:start position:0%
somebody that's absconded and within two
 
05:08:10.868 --> 05:08:10.878 align:start position:0%
hours we were able to bring them back
 
05:08:13.750 --> 05:08:13.760 align:start position:0%
but we still counted that as
 
05:08:15.990 --> 05:08:16.000 align:start position:0%
a walk away escape where the
 
05:08:18.628 --> 05:08:18.638 align:start position:0%
investigator had to use resources to get
 
05:08:21.750 --> 05:08:21.760 align:start position:0%
that person back so that's
 
05:08:23.910 --> 05:08:23.920 align:start position:0%
one of the types of
 
05:08:26.070 --> 05:08:26.080 align:start position:0%
30 that i mentioned so it is about five
 
05:08:28.708 --> 05:08:28.718 align:start position:0%
to six a year okay uh well and what my
 
05:08:30.628 --> 05:08:30.638 align:start position:0%
question was is um
 
05:08:33.350 --> 05:08:33.360 align:start position:0%
you know was that but it's um also
 
05:08:34.788 --> 05:08:34.798 align:start position:0%
what crimes
 
05:08:37.910 --> 05:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
did those 30 if any crimes did they
 
05:08:40.390 --> 05:08:40.400 align:start position:0%
commit while before that you caught up
 
05:08:41.830 --> 05:08:41.840 align:start position:0%
to him and tapped him on the shoulder
 
05:08:43.430 --> 05:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
and said please come with me
 
05:08:46.868 --> 05:08:46.878 align:start position:0%
so in some cases they were also felons
 
05:08:49.350 --> 05:08:49.360 align:start position:0%
in possession where they had a weapon
 
05:08:51.990 --> 05:08:52.000 align:start position:0%
they were a felon that had secured
 
05:08:52.000 --> 05:08:53.350 align:start position:0%
they were a felon that had secured
somehow

05:08:53.350 --> 05:08:53.360 align:start position:0%
somehow
 
05:08:54.788 --> 05:08:54.798 align:start position:0%
in the one case i told you about the
 
05:08:56.788 --> 05:08:56.798 align:start position:0%
girlfriend had provided the individual
 
05:08:58.708 --> 05:08:58.718 align:start position:0%
weapon so that's a crime that they
 
05:08:58.718 --> 05:09:00.070 align:start position:0%
weapon so that's a crime that they
committed

05:09:00.070 --> 05:09:00.080 align:start position:0%
committed
 
05:09:00.080 --> 05:09:01.750 align:start position:0%
committed
they

05:09:01.750 --> 05:09:01.760 align:start position:0%
they
 
05:09:04.390 --> 05:09:04.400 align:start position:0%
were in virginia and i believe
 
05:09:07.190 --> 05:09:07.200 align:start position:0%
they were caught trying to
 
05:09:08.628 --> 05:09:08.638 align:start position:0%
the the way that we caught them in
 
05:09:11.590 --> 05:09:11.600 align:start position:0%
virginia is there was the warrant and
 
05:09:14.390 --> 05:09:14.400 align:start position:0%
they were trying to rob a convenience
 
05:09:17.430 --> 05:09:17.440 align:start position:0%
store down in virginia
 
05:09:17.440 --> 05:09:19.110 align:start position:0%
store down in virginia
so

05:09:19.110 --> 05:09:19.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:09:21.510 --> 05:09:21.520 align:start position:0%
it's again a myriad of of types of
 
05:09:23.830 --> 05:09:23.840 align:start position:0%
offenses that they could commit
 
05:09:25.510 --> 05:09:25.520 align:start position:0%
i do know
 
05:09:27.110 --> 05:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
a little bit different
 
05:09:30.150 --> 05:09:30.160 align:start position:0%
experience not necessarily an escapee
 
05:09:32.230 --> 05:09:32.240 align:start position:0%
but somebody who was on parole
 
05:09:34.868 --> 05:09:34.878 align:start position:0%
that had not shown up for there's a
 
05:09:36.868 --> 05:09:36.878 align:start position:0%
warrant out for that individual on
 
05:09:40.310 --> 05:09:40.320 align:start position:0%
parole this doesn't necessarily affect
 
05:09:42.868 --> 05:09:42.878 align:start position:0%
this what i'm telling you but um we do
 
05:09:44.708 --> 05:09:44.718 align:start position:0%
know that a parolee has
 
05:09:46.470 --> 05:09:46.480 align:start position:0%
murdered somebody after
 
05:09:48.708 --> 05:09:48.718 align:start position:0%
not showing up for for parole down in
 
05:09:52.788 --> 05:09:52.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:54.628 --> 05:09:54.638 align:start position:0%
it could be anything
 
05:09:57.590 --> 05:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:59.110 --> 05:09:59.120 align:start position:0%
go ahead represent
 
05:10:00.550 --> 05:10:00.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman members thank you
 
05:10:02.628 --> 05:10:02.638 align:start position:0%
for taking my question i appreciate all
 
05:10:03.910 --> 05:10:03.920 align:start position:0%
of the
 
05:10:05.830 --> 05:10:05.840 align:start position:0%
issues of severity that
 
05:10:07.430 --> 05:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
for example the ones who just addressed
 
05:10:10.070 --> 05:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
and bodily injury or force used
 
05:10:12.230 --> 05:10:12.240 align:start position:0%
but correct me if i'm wrong does would
 
05:10:14.150 --> 05:10:14.160 align:start position:0%
this allow
 
05:10:17.030 --> 05:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
someone who was convicted of a
 
05:10:17.040 --> 05:10:18.390 align:start position:0%
someone who was convicted of a
misdemeanor

05:10:18.390 --> 05:10:18.400 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor
 
05:10:18.400 --> 05:10:20.788 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor
and

05:10:20.788 --> 05:10:20.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:25.030 --> 05:10:25.040 align:start position:0%
for example um assigned to um
 
05:10:26.550 --> 05:10:26.560 align:start position:0%
home confinement
 
05:10:29.030 --> 05:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
who maybe wasn't very bright and just
 
05:10:30.868 --> 05:10:30.878 align:start position:0%
without even ripping the thing off
 
05:10:33.110 --> 05:10:33.120 align:start position:0%
walked down to the local
 
05:10:35.430 --> 05:10:35.440 align:start position:0%
convenience store to get a
 
05:10:37.190 --> 05:10:37.200 align:start position:0%
soft drink or something
 
05:10:39.510 --> 05:10:39.520 align:start position:0%
i mean they they could then be charged
 
05:10:41.910 --> 05:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
with the felony under this law is that
 
05:10:46.070 --> 05:10:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:48.948 --> 05:10:48.958 align:start position:0%
i guess there is the possibility that a
 
05:10:50.708 --> 05:10:50.718 align:start position:0%
prosecutor might
 
05:10:50.718 --> 05:10:51.990 align:start position:0%
prosecutor might
somebody

05:10:51.990 --> 05:10:52.000 align:start position:0%
somebody
 
05:10:54.948 --> 05:10:54.958 align:start position:0%
the probation or parole officer that is
 
05:10:56.628 --> 05:10:56.638 align:start position:0%
monitoring that individual on
 
05:10:58.470 --> 05:10:58.480 align:start position:0%
administrative home confinement would
 
05:11:00.948 --> 05:11:00.958 align:start position:0%
have the discretion as to what they were
 
05:11:03.350 --> 05:11:03.360 align:start position:0%
going to do for next steps
 
05:11:05.590 --> 05:11:05.600 align:start position:0%
i don't believe that a prosecutor would
 
05:11:07.670 --> 05:11:07.680 align:start position:0%
ever take that case
 
05:11:07.680 --> 05:11:09.270 align:start position:0%
ever take that case
but

05:11:09.270 --> 05:11:09.280 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:11:11.110 --> 05:11:11.120 align:start position:0%
to to be frank that
 
05:11:12.470 --> 05:11:12.480 align:start position:0%
someone may
 
05:11:14.708 --> 05:11:14.718 align:start position:0%
interpret it that they could
 
05:11:16.948 --> 05:11:16.958 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:11:19.590 --> 05:11:19.600 align:start position:0%
um question of the chair is is there
 
05:11:22.708 --> 05:11:22.718 align:start position:0%
um is there a definition in statute of
 
05:11:22.718 --> 05:11:23.750 align:start position:0%
um is there a definition in statute of
escape

05:11:23.750 --> 05:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
escape
 
05:11:26.470 --> 05:11:26.480 align:start position:0%
is it there is not i i did look at that
 
05:11:27.910 --> 05:11:27.920 align:start position:0%
and that's why it's
 
05:11:27.920 --> 05:11:29.750 align:start position:0%
and that's why it's
that

05:11:29.750 --> 05:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:11:31.430 --> 05:11:31.440 align:start position:0%
the statute does not have that
 
05:11:34.230 --> 05:11:34.240 align:start position:0%
definition at the forefront of it nor
 
05:11:35.750 --> 05:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
does the definition
 
05:11:37.590 --> 05:11:37.600 align:start position:0%
section of
 
05:11:41.190 --> 05:11:41.200 align:start position:0%
the statute which i think is in rsa
 
05:11:42.708 --> 05:11:42.718 align:start position:0%
i'm not even going to guess i can't okay
 
05:11:43.750 --> 05:11:43.760 align:start position:0%
that's fine
 
05:11:46.150 --> 05:11:46.160 align:start position:0%
um could you just uh because i sense
 
05:11:47.750 --> 05:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
from the committee's questioning that we
 
05:11:51.750 --> 05:11:51.760 align:start position:0%
have concerns about um people um with
 
05:11:53.190 --> 05:11:53.200 align:start position:0%
serving time for misdemeanors being
 
05:11:55.190 --> 05:11:55.200 align:start position:0%
charged with a felony for escape could
 
05:11:56.788 --> 05:11:56.798 align:start position:0%
you um
 
05:11:58.628 --> 05:11:58.638 align:start position:0%
briefly just tell the committee what's
 
05:12:01.670 --> 05:12:01.680 align:start position:0%
involved in in in apprehending someone
 
05:12:04.310 --> 05:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
who's escaped that it would in your mind
 
05:12:07.430 --> 05:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
rise to the level of a felony um
 
05:12:09.910 --> 05:12:09.920 align:start position:0%
offense in other words danger to
 
05:12:11.910 --> 05:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
responders expenses things of this
 
05:12:15.910 --> 05:12:15.920 align:start position:0%
nature certainly so um anytime someone
 
05:12:17.830 --> 05:12:17.840 align:start position:0%
that is
 
05:12:20.310 --> 05:12:20.320 align:start position:0%
incarcerated and is a felon
 
05:12:21.750 --> 05:12:21.760 align:start position:0%
and when they
 
05:12:21.760 --> 05:12:23.990 align:start position:0%
and when they
leave

05:12:23.990 --> 05:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
leave
 
05:12:27.030 --> 05:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
they potentially may go out and do
 
05:12:29.670 --> 05:12:29.680 align:start position:0%
commit further criminal events so when
 
05:12:32.628 --> 05:12:32.638 align:start position:0%
we first find that they have left
 
05:12:35.590 --> 05:12:35.600 align:start position:0%
in an esc if we
 
05:12:38.470 --> 05:12:38.480 align:start position:0%
see them trying to leave the facility
 
05:12:42.310 --> 05:12:42.320 align:start position:0%
we are able to pursue them and make the
 
05:12:45.270 --> 05:12:45.280 align:start position:0%
effectuate an arrest in pursuit during
 
05:12:46.948 --> 05:12:46.958 align:start position:0%
that pursuit
 
05:12:48.708 --> 05:12:48.718 align:start position:0%
you may
 
05:12:48.718 --> 05:12:50.070 align:start position:0%
you may
encounter

05:12:50.070 --> 05:12:50.080 align:start position:0%
encounter
 
05:12:50.080 --> 05:12:52.070 align:start position:0%
encounter
the

05:12:52.070 --> 05:12:52.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:12:53.830 --> 05:12:53.840 align:start position:0%
high-speed chase
 
05:12:56.390 --> 05:12:56.400 align:start position:0%
that could potentially result in
 
05:12:58.708 --> 05:12:58.718 align:start position:0%
an incident occurring anywhere on the
 
05:13:00.310 --> 05:13:00.320 align:start position:0%
highway with
 
05:13:03.590 --> 05:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
civilians that aren't involved at all
 
05:13:06.150 --> 05:13:06.160 align:start position:0%
the state police would have to be
 
05:13:07.430 --> 05:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
get involved
 
05:13:09.270 --> 05:13:09.280 align:start position:0%
that warrant that i talked about trying
 
05:13:11.270 --> 05:13:11.280 align:start position:0%
to get a warrant that
 
05:13:13.990 --> 05:13:14.000 align:start position:0%
is outside of just new hampshire new
 
05:13:14.000 --> 05:13:15.750 align:start position:0%
is outside of just new hampshire new
england

05:13:15.750 --> 05:13:15.760 align:start position:0%
england
 
05:13:17.670 --> 05:13:17.680 align:start position:0%
the east coast
 
05:13:20.788 --> 05:13:20.798 align:start position:0%
that's an expense trying to in one case
 
05:13:22.550 --> 05:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
we knew an individual
 
05:13:25.350 --> 05:13:25.360 align:start position:0%
had absconded we set up
 
05:13:29.030 --> 05:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
with local police and state police
 
05:13:31.590 --> 05:13:31.600 align:start position:0%
surveillance around the house
 
05:13:35.110 --> 05:13:35.120 align:start position:0%
knowing that it was a house that
 
05:13:37.590 --> 05:13:37.600 align:start position:0%
sold or manufactured methamphetamine
 
05:13:39.110 --> 05:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
from it
 
05:13:40.470 --> 05:13:40.480 align:start position:0%
so there's
 
05:13:43.590 --> 05:13:43.600 align:start position:0%
potential issues with that type of
 
05:13:43.600 --> 05:13:44.470 align:start position:0%
potential issues with that type of
of

05:13:44.470 --> 05:13:44.480 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:13:46.390 --> 05:13:46.400 align:start position:0%
trying to go into a house like that and
 
05:13:49.350 --> 05:13:49.360 align:start position:0%
bring somebody out
 
05:13:50.390 --> 05:13:50.400 align:start position:0%
i could
 
05:13:52.948 --> 05:13:52.958 align:start position:0%
potentially keep going with the
 
05:13:55.750 --> 05:13:55.760 align:start position:0%
the issues that that arise and there's
 
05:13:57.590 --> 05:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
maybe some in the room that are in law
 
05:14:00.788 --> 05:14:00.798 align:start position:0%
enforcement that might be better able to
 
05:14:03.830 --> 05:14:03.840 align:start position:0%
explain some of the
 
05:14:03.840 --> 05:14:04.868 align:start position:0%
explain some of the
real

05:14:04.868 --> 05:14:04.878 align:start position:0%
real
 
05:14:08.070 --> 05:14:08.080 align:start position:0%
concerns about the cost and
 
05:14:08.080 --> 05:14:08.788 align:start position:0%
concerns about the cost and
the

05:14:08.788 --> 05:14:08.798 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:14:10.948 --> 05:14:10.958 align:start position:0%
bodily injury that may result
 
05:14:13.350 --> 05:14:13.360 align:start position:0%
from trying to effectuate getting
 
05:14:15.750 --> 05:14:15.760 align:start position:0%
somebody back
 
05:14:18.788 --> 05:14:18.798 align:start position:0%
and just one more question
 
05:14:20.550 --> 05:14:20.560 align:start position:0%
because someone's serving time for a
 
05:14:22.788 --> 05:14:22.798 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor that's not necessarily what
 
05:14:24.628 --> 05:14:24.638 align:start position:0%
they were charged with is it isn't it
 
05:14:26.390 --> 05:14:26.400 align:start position:0%
possible that they pled that and
 
05:14:27.990 --> 05:14:28.000 align:start position:0%
accepted it and they could actually have
 
05:14:29.830 --> 05:14:29.840 align:start position:0%
committed a felony
 
05:14:31.030 --> 05:14:31.040 align:start position:0%
that is true
 
05:14:31.040 --> 05:14:32.470 align:start position:0%
that is true
um

was serving for a misdemeanor sentence

was serving for a misdemeanor sentence
um

05:14:59.270 --> 05:14:59.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:15:01.190 --> 05:15:01.200 align:start position:0%
more than one year so they get the a

05:15:13.510 --> 05:15:13.520 align:start position:0%
prison
 
05:15:15.510 --> 05:15:15.520 align:start position:0%
but it's the prosecutor and that defense
 
05:15:17.270 --> 05:15:17.280 align:start position:0%
counsel that have
 
05:15:19.030 --> 05:15:19.040 align:start position:0%
and i hate to use the word manipulate
 
05:15:21.910 --> 05:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
but have somehow managed to
 
05:15:25.430 --> 05:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
to change the structure of the sentence
 
05:15:27.910 --> 05:15:27.920 align:start position:0%
in an attempt that they don't go to
 
05:15:27.920 --> 05:15:29.830 align:start position:0%
in an attempt that they don't go to
prison

05:15:29.830 --> 05:15:29.840 align:start position:0%
prison
 
05:15:31.430 --> 05:15:31.440 align:start position:0%
that they stay at the house of
 
05:15:34.390 --> 05:15:34.400 align:start position:0%
corrections but it really is
 
05:15:36.948 --> 05:15:36.958 align:start position:0%
in all other respects it would have been
 
05:15:38.948 --> 05:15:38.958 align:start position:0%
a felony but for the way that they were
 
05:15:40.868 --> 05:15:40.878 align:start position:0%
sentenced so i hope that answers your
 
05:15:40.878 --> 05:15:41.830 align:start position:0%
sentenced so i hope that answers your
question

05:15:41.830 --> 05:15:41.840 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:15:43.190 --> 05:15:43.200 align:start position:0%
mr chair
 
05:15:46.708 --> 05:15:46.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:49.110 --> 05:15:49.120 align:start position:0%
i apologize for going over the current
 
05:15:50.628 --> 05:15:50.638 align:start position:0%
wording but the current wording has an
 
05:15:52.550 --> 05:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
effect when it's changed
 
05:15:54.628 --> 05:15:54.638 align:start position:0%
and could you just explain
 
05:15:57.190 --> 05:15:57.200 align:start position:0%
the crime is effect and escape
 
05:15:58.550 --> 05:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
and i'm just wondering what
 
05:16:00.868 --> 05:16:00.878 align:start position:0%
circumstances or or how you would
 
05:16:03.350 --> 05:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
adjudicate that on a person that's on
 
05:16:03.360 --> 05:16:04.708 align:start position:0%
adjudicate that on a person that's on
parole

05:16:04.708 --> 05:16:04.718 align:start position:0%
parole
 
05:16:06.868 --> 05:16:06.878 align:start position:0%
if they're out what what do they have to
 
05:16:08.390 --> 05:16:08.400 align:start position:0%
escape from
 
05:16:11.350 --> 05:16:11.360 align:start position:0%
so they're still on serving a sentence
 
05:16:12.390 --> 05:16:12.400 align:start position:0%
under the
 
05:16:15.190 --> 05:16:15.200 align:start position:0%
um their their minimus says
 
05:16:17.910 --> 05:16:17.920 align:start position:0%
that they have it's a 10 to 20 year for
 
05:16:21.350 --> 05:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
example and 15 years into that sentence
 
05:16:23.510 --> 05:16:23.520 align:start position:0%
they are sent out on parole so they
 
05:16:26.550 --> 05:16:26.560 align:start position:0%
still have that five years left on that
 
05:16:26.560 --> 05:16:27.830 align:start position:0%
still have that five years left on that
sentence

05:16:27.830 --> 05:16:27.840 align:start position:0%
sentence
 
05:16:30.310 --> 05:16:30.320 align:start position:0%
so they're still serving a
 
05:16:31.750 --> 05:16:31.760 align:start position:0%
sentence in new hampshire we're still
 
05:16:33.910 --> 05:16:33.920 align:start position:0%
subject to the correction department
 
05:16:36.310 --> 05:16:36.320 align:start position:0%
thank you yes sir
 
05:16:36.320 --> 05:16:37.190 align:start position:0%
thank you yes sir
and

05:16:37.190 --> 05:16:37.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:16:39.030 --> 05:16:39.040 align:start position:0%
to answer represent newman they would
 
05:16:40.868 --> 05:16:40.878 align:start position:0%
also as conditions of the parole might
 
05:16:42.550 --> 05:16:42.560 align:start position:0%
say you can't leave the state without
 
05:16:44.390 --> 05:16:44.400 align:start position:0%
permission to be rural officer and if
 
05:16:47.190 --> 05:16:47.200 align:start position:0%
they did that would constitute an escape
 
05:16:49.110 --> 05:16:49.120 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
05:16:49.120 --> 05:16:50.070 align:start position:0%
any further questions
good

05:16:50.070 --> 05:16:50.080 align:start position:0%
good
 
05:16:51.830 --> 05:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
i was just thinking without any
 
05:16:53.510 --> 05:16:53.520 align:start position:0%
conditions how would they do it but they
 
05:16:54.390 --> 05:16:54.400 align:start position:0%
are still
 
05:16:56.310 --> 05:16:56.320 align:start position:0%
in the big scheme of things under the
 
05:16:58.550 --> 05:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
the uh control of the corrections
 
05:17:01.030 --> 05:17:01.040 align:start position:0%

and one that i believe is uh in
 
05:17:50.070 --> 05:17:50.080 align:start position:0%
significant need within our state it's

no secret
 
05:17:53.670 --> 05:17:53.680 align:start position:0%
uh with the mental health issues that
 
05:17:55.750 --> 05:17:55.760 align:start position:0%
are going on
 
05:17:58.470 --> 05:17:58.480 align:start position:0%
the last four shootings by police fatal
 
05:18:00.310 --> 05:18:00.320 align:start position:0%
shootings have been people that were
 
05:18:02.628 --> 05:18:02.638 align:start position:0%
known to be
 
05:18:05.030 --> 05:18:05.040 align:start position:0%
to have mental health issues
 
05:18:07.990 --> 05:18:08.000 align:start position:0%

um

05:18:37.110 --> 05:18:37.120 align:start position:0%

and we met several times and and i
 
05:18:43.910 --> 05:18:43.920 align:start position:0%
finally said hey okay
 
05:18:45.430 --> 05:18:45.440 align:start position:0%
we're talking but we're not solving
 
05:18:47.670 --> 05:18:47.680 align:start position:0%
anything and so i said let's develop a
 
05:18:49.350 --> 05:18:49.360 align:start position:0%
program so that we get one police
 
05:18:50.788 --> 05:18:50.798 align:start position:0%
officer in every jurisdiction in the
 
05:18:52.788 --> 05:18:52.798 align:start position:0%
state that includes county sheriffs that
 
05:18:55.430 --> 05:18:55.440 align:start position:0%
includes prisons and and uh correctional
 
05:18:55.440 --> 05:18:56.470 align:start position:0%
includes prisons and and uh correctional
facilities

05:18:56.470 --> 05:18:56.480 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
05:18:56.480 --> 05:18:57.430 align:start position:0%
facilities
um

05:18:57.430 --> 05:18:57.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:18:59.110 --> 05:18:59.120 align:start position:0%
trained in cit
 
05:19:02.310 --> 05:19:02.320 align:start position:0%
we have mobile crisis units that are
 
05:19:04.470 --> 05:19:04.480 align:start position:0%
coming online all right but still the
 
05:19:06.708 --> 05:19:06.718 align:start position:0%
first person on on scene is almost
 
05:19:06.718 --> 05:19:07.910 align:start position:0%
first person on on scene is almost
always

05:19:07.910 --> 05:19:07.920 align:start position:0%
always
 
05:19:09.990 --> 05:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
an officer of the law and we want to
 
05:19:12.788 --> 05:19:12.798 align:start position:0%
give my belief a former fbi agent and i
 
05:19:14.708 --> 05:19:14.718 align:start position:0%
know a number of my friends are local
 
05:19:16.868 --> 05:19:16.878 align:start position:0%
law enforcement and state police as well
 
05:19:18.948 --> 05:19:18.958 align:start position:0%
give them the tools
 
05:19:21.990 --> 05:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
so that they have at least the ability
 
05:19:22.000 --> 05:19:22.390 align:start position:0%
so that they have at least the ability
to

05:19:22.390 --> 05:19:22.400 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:19:22.400 --> 05:19:25.270 align:start position:0%
to
[Music]

05:19:25.270 --> 05:19:25.280 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:19:27.110 --> 05:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
effectively deal with a person that is

mentally unstable
 
05:19:31.990 --> 05:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
we see that the department of i'm sorry
 
05:19:34.230 --> 05:19:34.240 align:start position:0%
the attorney general the ag
 
05:19:35.990 --> 05:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
does an investigation after each fatal
 
05:19:38.628 --> 05:19:38.638 align:start position:0%
shooting it's very narrowly scoped it is
 
05:19:40.628 --> 05:19:40.638 align:start position:0%
scoped exclusively to determine whether
 
05:19:41.830 --> 05:19:41.840 align:start position:0%
or not the officer's actions were
 
05:19:42.948 --> 05:19:42.958 align:start position:0%
criminal or not did they meet the
 
05:19:45.270 --> 05:19:45.280 align:start position:0%
statute statutory requirements for use
 
05:19:47.270 --> 05:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
of lethal force that's it
 
05:19:47.280 --> 05:19:48.230 align:start position:0%
of lethal force that's it
but

05:19:48.230 --> 05:19:48.240 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:19:50.150 --> 05:19:50.160 align:start position:0%
there's never any discussion of whether
 
05:19:52.230 --> 05:19:52.240 align:start position:0%
it's justified i'm sorry whether it's
 
05:19:52.240 --> 05:19:53.750 align:start position:0%
it's justified i'm sorry whether it's
necessary

05:19:53.750 --> 05:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
05:19:55.590 --> 05:19:55.600 align:start position:0%
and that's where my concern is all right
 
05:19:57.750 --> 05:19:57.760 align:start position:0%
we part of this bill sets up money to
 
05:19:59.030 --> 05:19:59.040 align:start position:0%
train one police officer in every
 
05:20:00.948 --> 05:20:00.958 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction in the state
 
05:20:03.990 --> 05:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
in that cit training
 
05:20:05.510 --> 05:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
the second part of the bill sets up a
 
05:20:07.030 --> 05:20:07.040 align:start position:0%
study committee
 
05:20:08.150 --> 05:20:08.160 align:start position:0%
and and
 
05:20:09.990 --> 05:20:10.000 align:start position:0%
instead of going directly to setting up
 
05:20:11.830 --> 05:20:11.840 align:start position:0%
a committee to review
 
05:20:15.270 --> 05:20:15.280 align:start position:0%
shootings involving mental health
 
05:20:15.280 --> 05:20:16.310 align:start position:0%
shootings involving mental health
issues

05:20:16.310 --> 05:20:16.320 align:start position:0%
issues
 
05:20:17.990 --> 05:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
we want to study it because it's it's
 
05:20:20.070 --> 05:20:20.080 align:start position:0%
rife with concern and i think
 
05:20:22.230 --> 05:20:22.240 align:start position:0%
justifiably from our police officers
 
05:20:24.070 --> 05:20:24.080 align:start position:0%
this if you read the language in the
 
05:20:24.080 --> 05:20:24.948 align:start position:0%
this if you read the language in the
bill

05:20:24.948 --> 05:20:24.958 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:20:27.670 --> 05:20:27.680 align:start position:0%
uh very clearly articulates it mirrors
 
05:20:29.350 --> 05:20:29.360 align:start position:0%
the language and the intent of the
 
05:20:31.190 --> 05:20:31.200 align:start position:0%
hospital board they review incidents in
 
05:20:32.708 --> 05:20:32.718 align:start position:0%
hospitals periodically and they take a
 
05:20:34.230 --> 05:20:34.240 align:start position:0%
look and say we should have done this
 
05:20:35.190 --> 05:20:35.200 align:start position:0%
and we didn't do that and we should
 
05:20:36.390 --> 05:20:36.400 align:start position:0%
improve our training with the other
 
05:20:36.400 --> 05:20:37.430 align:start position:0%
improve our training with the other
thing

05:20:37.430 --> 05:20:37.440 align:start position:0%
thing
 
05:20:38.868 --> 05:20:38.878 align:start position:0%
this would do that very same thing it
 
05:20:42.628 --> 05:20:42.638 align:start position:0%
would ensure statutorily that
 
05:20:46.550 --> 05:20:46.560 align:start position:0%
any review is non-punitive non-public
 
05:20:48.310 --> 05:20:48.320 align:start position:0%
and absolutely cannot be used in any
 
05:20:50.628 --> 05:20:50.638 align:start position:0%
prosecution any any civil case or any of
 
05:20:52.390 --> 05:20:52.400 align:start position:0%
the sort because at the end of the day
 
05:20:54.150 --> 05:20:54.160 align:start position:0%
what we're looking to do is to improve
 
05:20:56.550 --> 05:20:56.560 align:start position:0%
the procedures that our police officers
 
05:20:58.310 --> 05:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
use so they'd review an incident in
 
05:21:00.868 --> 05:21:00.878 align:start position:0%
which a person was killed or not shot
 
05:21:03.670 --> 05:21:03.680 align:start position:0%
okay and non-fatal and they look at it
 
05:21:04.708 --> 05:21:04.718 align:start position:0%
and say you know
 
05:21:06.390 --> 05:21:06.400 align:start position:0%
our training does this but it doesn't do
 
05:21:08.788 --> 05:21:08.798 align:start position:0%
that and that's the sole purpose of this
 
05:21:10.390 --> 05:21:10.400 align:start position:0%
but we're setting up a study committee
 
05:21:12.230 --> 05:21:12.240 align:start position:0%
to study that
 
05:21:14.070 --> 05:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
not a committee to actually do that
 
05:21:15.830 --> 05:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
because i think that we our officers
 
05:21:18.948 --> 05:21:18.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:20.868 --> 05:21:20.878 align:start position:0%
chief goldstein had expressed concern
 
05:21:22.708 --> 05:21:22.718 align:start position:0%
with respect to
 
05:21:24.550 --> 05:21:24.560 align:start position:0%
well what happens if the law changes
 
05:21:26.390 --> 05:21:26.400 align:start position:0%
after we implement this
 
05:21:28.390 --> 05:21:28.400 align:start position:0%
committee i said well you know what i
 
05:21:30.310 --> 05:21:30.320 align:start position:0%
would suspect that a number of law
 
05:21:32.390 --> 05:21:32.400 align:start position:0%
enforcement agencies attorney general
 
05:21:34.070 --> 05:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
and so forth by the way turned
 
05:21:35.350 --> 05:21:35.360 align:start position:0%
informella was also part of these
 
05:21:35.360 --> 05:21:36.708 align:start position:0%
informella was also part of these
discussions

05:21:36.708 --> 05:21:36.718 align:start position:0%
discussions
 
05:21:36.718 --> 05:21:39.110 align:start position:0%
discussions
um

05:21:39.110 --> 05:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:40.550 --> 05:21:40.560 align:start position:0%
that if that comes before the
 
05:21:42.310 --> 05:21:42.320 align:start position:0%
legislature i think that the legislature
 
05:21:43.910 --> 05:21:43.920 align:start position:0%
would have the wisdom to say we're not
 
05:21:45.750 --> 05:21:45.760 align:start position:0%
interested in in using this in a
 
05:21:45.760 --> 05:21:47.190 align:start position:0%
interested in in using this in a
punitive

05:21:47.190 --> 05:21:47.200 align:start position:0%
punitive
 
05:21:48.550 --> 05:21:48.560 align:start position:0%
interested in using is in a learning
 
05:21:50.390 --> 05:21:50.400 align:start position:0%
tool we do this in the airlines again
 
05:21:53.030 --> 05:21:53.040 align:start position:0%
i'm 31 year captain for united airlines
 
05:21:55.270 --> 05:21:55.280 align:start position:0%
and we self-disci we self-disclose we
 
05:21:56.550 --> 05:21:56.560 align:start position:0%
make a mistake
 
05:21:58.708 --> 05:21:58.718 align:start position:0%
and you also get a you get a buy you get
 
05:22:00.550 --> 05:22:00.560 align:start position:0%
one chance every five years to say and
 
05:22:02.070 --> 05:22:02.080 align:start position:0%
oops if you go to two now you're in
 
05:22:03.750 --> 05:22:03.760 align:start position:0%
front of the faa and it's not fun it's a
 
05:22:05.590 --> 05:22:05.600 align:start position:0%
long green table never been there don't
 
05:22:07.270 --> 05:22:07.280 align:start position:0%
plan on going
 
05:22:07.280 --> 05:22:07.990 align:start position:0%
plan on going
but

05:22:07.990 --> 05:22:08.000 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:22:10.628 --> 05:22:10.638 align:start position:0%
again the intent is in no way nor should
 
05:22:12.550 --> 05:22:12.560 align:start position:0%
it ever be construed to be punitive but
 
05:22:14.150 --> 05:22:14.160 align:start position:0%
rather let's make the resources our
 
05:22:15.590 --> 05:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
officers have the best they can be in
 
05:22:17.350 --> 05:22:17.360 align:start position:0%
the training
 
05:22:19.190 --> 05:22:19.200 align:start position:0%
to that end i have
 
05:22:21.510 --> 05:22:21.520 align:start position:0%
a language not an ols drafted amendment
 
05:22:23.190 --> 05:22:23.200 align:start position:0%
but language that was developed by
 
05:22:25.350 --> 05:22:25.360 align:start position:0%
director skipper because in the drafting
 
05:22:26.868 --> 05:22:26.878 align:start position:0%
of this bill and numbers of iterations
 
05:22:28.230 --> 05:22:28.240 align:start position:0%
that it went through
 
05:22:29.990 --> 05:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
we didn't provide him with a program
 
05:22:31.750 --> 05:22:31.760 align:start position:0%
administrator to run this thing all
 
05:22:31.760 --> 05:22:32.868 align:start position:0%
administrator to run this thing all
right

05:22:32.868 --> 05:22:32.878 align:start position:0%
right
 
05:22:34.390 --> 05:22:34.400 align:start position:0%
when this program is complete there'll
 
05:22:36.070 --> 05:22:36.080 align:start position:0%
be one police officer in every
 
05:22:37.910 --> 05:22:37.920 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction in the state we anticipate
 
05:22:39.670 --> 05:22:39.680 align:start position:0%
that taking about eight to nine months
 
05:22:40.868 --> 05:22:40.878 align:start position:0%
believe it or not
 
05:22:42.390 --> 05:22:42.400 align:start position:0%
because they can train him 30 at a time
 
05:22:43.590 --> 05:22:43.600 align:start position:0%
there's a very good cooperative
 
05:22:45.350 --> 05:22:45.360 align:start position:0%
agreement with the national guard over
 
05:22:47.510 --> 05:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
the new facility out there
 
05:22:48.708 --> 05:22:48.718 align:start position:0%
and so
 
05:22:50.708 --> 05:22:50.718 align:start position:0%
this would accomplish that objective it
 
05:22:53.110 --> 05:22:53.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't address going forward do we want
 
05:22:55.030 --> 05:22:55.040 align:start position:0%
to do we want to train more people or
 
05:22:56.470 --> 05:22:56.480 align:start position:0%
whatever that's up to the next budget
 
05:22:58.628 --> 05:22:58.638 align:start position:0%
cycle but this closes the gap and in the
 
05:22:59.910 --> 05:22:59.920 align:start position:0%
next eight to nine months we can have
 
05:23:01.590 --> 05:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
one officer in every jurisdiction in the
 
05:23:01.600 --> 05:23:02.948 align:start position:0%
one officer in every jurisdiction in the
state

05:23:02.948 --> 05:23:02.958 align:start position:0%
state
 
05:23:04.390 --> 05:23:04.400 align:start position:0%
police state police have a hundred
 
05:23:06.310 --> 05:23:06.320 align:start position:0%
already trained there's 48 communities
 
05:23:07.590 --> 05:23:07.600 align:start position:0%
already have most of those are more
 
05:23:09.190 --> 05:23:09.200 align:start position:0%
affluent communities that can afford to
 
05:23:11.110 --> 05:23:11.120 align:start position:0%
spring an officer for the weeks it's a
 
05:23:12.390 --> 05:23:12.400 align:start position:0%
hour course
 
05:23:16.310 --> 05:23:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:18.390 --> 05:23:18.400 align:start position:0%
and so i'll with that i'll conclude my
 
05:23:24.948 --> 05:23:24.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:26.628 --> 05:23:26.638 align:start position:0%
there be no questions thank you senator
 
05:23:28.070 --> 05:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
uh will you provide us with a copy of
 
05:23:30.310 --> 05:23:30.320 align:start position:0%
that is that a suggested amendment it is
 
05:23:33.270 --> 05:23:33.280 align:start position:0%
okay director skip and nanny both um who
 
05:23:34.788 --> 05:23:34.798 align:start position:0%

05:34:41.030 --> 05:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
bail commissioners to be there to help
 
05:34:43.110 --> 05:34:43.120 align:start position:0%
them secure their release without having
 
05:34:46.310 --> 05:34:46.320 align:start position:0%
to wait hours or even days for a judge
 
05:34:47.830 --> 05:34:47.840 align:start position:0%
the legislature has supported the
 
05:34:49.350 --> 05:34:49.360 align:start position:0%
principle that no one should be denied
 
05:34:51.030 --> 05:34:51.040 align:start position:0%
bail simply because they can't afford to
 
05:34:52.628 --> 05:34:52.638 align:start position:0%
pay it but are not a threat to the
 
05:34:52.638 --> 05:34:54.070 align:start position:0%
pay it but are not a threat to the
community

05:34:54.070 --> 05:34:54.080 align:start position:0%
community
 
05:34:55.350 --> 05:34:55.360 align:start position:0%
for this vital service bail
 
05:34:58.548 --> 05:34:58.558 align:start position:0%
commissioners charge just forty dollars
 
05:35:00.470 --> 05:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
this amount doesn't take their expenses
 
05:35:02.788 --> 05:35:02.798 align:start position:0%
into consideration giving a call on a
 
05:35:04.548 --> 05:35:04.558 align:start position:0%
saturday night and driving across the
 
05:35:06.548 --> 05:35:06.558 align:start position:0%
county can burn up a tank of gas in
 
05:35:08.708 --> 05:35:08.718 align:start position:0%
these days that's more expensive than
 
05:35:11.590 --> 05:35:11.600 align:start position:0%
ever bail commissioners average 60 calls
 
05:35:15.750 --> 05:35:15.760 align:start position:0%
per month and 2100 miles
 
05:35:18.070 --> 05:35:18.080 align:start position:0%
senator gannon introduced sb 361 in
 
05:35:20.070 --> 05:35:20.080 align:start position:0%
order to authorize bail commissioners to
 
05:35:23.270 --> 05:35:23.280 align:start position:0%
collect mileage in addition to the 40
 
05:35:25.430 --> 05:35:25.440 align:start position:0%
flat fee you're all familiar with the
 
05:35:27.270 --> 05:35:27.280 align:start position:0%
irs mileage system this would be based
 
05:35:29.030 --> 05:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
on actual miles driven
 
05:35:31.350 --> 05:35:31.360 align:start position:0%
reimbursed at the irs rate
 
05:35:33.110 --> 05:35:33.120 align:start position:0%
like the fee the mileage charge would be
 
05:35:36.470 --> 05:35:36.480 align:start position:0%
waived if the defendant were indigent
 
05:35:39.110 --> 05:35:39.120 align:start position:0%
sb 361 received unanimous support of the
 
05:35:41.510 --> 05:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
senate judiciary and finance committees
 
05:35:42.948 --> 05:35:42.958 align:start position:0%
and cleared the senate floor twice
 
05:35:45.030 --> 05:35:45.040 align:start position:0%
without opposition senator gannon thanks
 
05:35:46.948 --> 05:35:46.958 align:start position:0%
you for your consideration and ask for
 
05:35:49.270 --> 05:35:49.280 align:start position:0%
your support of sb 361 if you have any
 
05:35:51.110 --> 05:35:51.120 align:start position:0%
questions for senator gannon i am happy
 
05:35:52.868 --> 05:35:52.878 align:start position:0%
to make sure he gets you an answer but i
 
05:35:54.310 --> 05:35:54.320 align:start position:0%
would defer to some bail commissioners
 
05:35:56.548 --> 05:35:56.558 align:start position:0%
who are here today to tell you directly
 
05:35:59.030 --> 05:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
about their experiences in the field
 
05:36:00.470 --> 05:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
thank you again for allowing me to bring
 
05:36:02.708 --> 05:36:02.718 align:start position:0%
in this bill on senator gannon's behalf
 
05:36:14.708 --> 05:36:14.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:21.350 --> 05:36:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:23.190 --> 05:36:23.200 align:start position:0%
thank you ladies and gentlemen

this is my fifth year as a bail
 
05:36:33.910 --> 05:36:33.920 align:start position:0%
commissioner starting
 
05:36:36.628 --> 05:36:36.638 align:start position:0%
it's a fascinating interesting job
 
05:36:39.670 --> 05:36:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:41.430 --> 05:36:41.440 align:start position:0%
obviously you know i support all the
 
05:36:43.270 --> 05:36:43.280 align:start position:0%
police departments
 
05:36:45.270 --> 05:36:45.280 align:start position:0%

05:36:46.788 --> 05:36:46.798 align:start position:0%
and state police

in any other department that needs me
 
05:36:54.230 --> 05:36:54.240 align:start position:0%
he's right the mr bosse said we go out
 
05:36:55.830 --> 05:36:55.840 align:start position:0%
all hours of the day and night and it
 
05:36:57.590 --> 05:36:57.600 align:start position:0%
does happen
 
05:36:59.670 --> 05:36:59.680 align:start position:0%
sometimes the when the weather's warmer
 
05:37:01.510 --> 05:37:01.520 align:start position:0%
you get a lot more calls from different
 
05:37:01.520 --> 05:37:02.868 align:start position:0%
you get a lot more calls from different
departments

05:37:02.868 --> 05:37:02.878 align:start position:0%
departments
 
05:37:04.948 --> 05:37:04.958 align:start position:0%
and we're there to serve the
 
05:37:06.708 --> 05:37:06.718 align:start position:0%
people of new hampshire
 
05:37:10.548 --> 05:37:10.558 align:start position:0%
and make sure everybody is stay safe
 
05:37:12.868 --> 05:37:12.878 align:start position:0%
it's always our biggest concern
 
05:37:14.628 --> 05:37:14.638 align:start position:0%
i have uh submitted some papers here
 
05:37:16.150 --> 05:37:16.160 align:start position:0%
from police chiefs
 
05:37:18.230 --> 05:37:18.240 align:start position:0%
uh they're somewhere
 
05:37:20.150 --> 05:37:20.160 align:start position:0%
i would have more signatures if i had
 
05:37:21.670 --> 05:37:21.680 align:start position:0%
more time
 
05:37:23.030 --> 05:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
they're all in favor of us getting
 
05:37:25.750 --> 05:37:25.760 align:start position:0%
mileage it's an important factor i also
 
05:37:27.030 --> 05:37:27.040 align:start position:0%
submitted another
 
05:37:29.430 --> 05:37:29.440 align:start position:0%
about the 18 police stations that i
 
05:37:29.440 --> 05:37:30.708 align:start position:0%
about the 18 police stations that i
cover

05:37:30.708 --> 05:37:30.718 align:start position:0%
cover
 
05:37:32.548 --> 05:37:32.558 align:start position:0%
three hospitals
 
05:37:32.558 --> 05:37:34.390 align:start position:0%
three hospitals
obviously

05:37:34.390 --> 05:37:34.400 align:start position:0%
obviously
 
05:37:36.868 --> 05:37:36.878 align:start position:0%
rockingham county jail and the mileage
 
05:37:38.868 --> 05:37:38.878 align:start position:0%
to and fro from my house
 
05:37:40.230 --> 05:37:40.240 align:start position:0%
i don't know how all this is going to
 
05:37:42.070 --> 05:37:42.080 align:start position:0%
pan out but we definitely need my
 
05:37:42.080 --> 05:37:43.670 align:start position:0%
pan out but we definitely need my
mileage

05:37:43.670 --> 05:37:43.680 align:start position:0%
mileage
 
05:37:43.680 --> 05:37:44.948 align:start position:0%
mileage
um

05:37:44.948 --> 05:37:44.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:37:46.868 --> 05:37:46.878 align:start position:0%
not just because the mile the cost of
 
05:37:48.548 --> 05:37:48.558 align:start position:0%
fuel has gone way up but the maintenance
 
05:37:49.830 --> 05:37:49.840 align:start position:0%
of a vehicle
 
05:37:52.548 --> 05:37:52.558 align:start position:0%
is obviously a chief concern
 
05:37:54.390 --> 05:37:54.400 align:start position:0%
i want to tell you i definitely enjoy
 
05:37:56.470 --> 05:37:56.480 align:start position:0%
doing this job
 
05:37:59.030 --> 05:37:59.040 align:start position:0%
it's very fascinating
 
05:38:00.868 --> 05:38:00.878 align:start position:0%
i take it with a phenomenal
 
05:38:03.910 --> 05:38:03.920 align:start position:0%
responsibility to the public
 
05:38:05.910 --> 05:38:05.920 align:start position:0%
and for the police office the offices
 
05:38:10.548 --> 05:38:10.558 align:start position:0%
that i serve mostly in the jail
 
05:38:12.390 --> 05:38:12.400 align:start position:0%
if you have any other questions i i
 
05:38:13.910 --> 05:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
don't want to go off topic or anything
 
05:38:25.830 --> 05:38:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:29.110 --> 05:38:29.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:33.510 --> 05:38:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:35.430 --> 05:38:35.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:38:36.868 --> 05:38:36.878 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for taking my
 
05:38:40.390 --> 05:38:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:42.868 --> 05:38:42.878 align:start position:0%
is if i read this correctly
 
05:38:44.868 --> 05:38:44.878 align:start position:0%
this mileage is not going to be paid by
 
05:38:47.270 --> 05:38:47.280 align:start position:0%
the state or the county or whoever this
 
05:38:50.948 --> 05:38:50.958 align:start position:0%
is paid by the person the defendant yeah
 
05:38:53.350 --> 05:38:53.360 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
05:38:55.430 --> 05:38:55.440 align:start position:0%
how many defendants
 
05:38:56.628 --> 05:38:56.638 align:start position:0%
pay the
 
05:38:59.110 --> 05:38:59.120 align:start position:0%
40 bucks in the first place
 
05:39:01.350 --> 05:39:01.360 align:start position:0%
let alone the mileage i only can speak
 
05:39:02.868 --> 05:39:02.878 align:start position:0%
for myself
 
05:39:06.948 --> 05:39:06.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:08.230 --> 05:39:08.240 align:start position:0%
and i can
 
05:39:10.548 --> 05:39:10.558 align:start position:0%
if i can
 
05:39:12.788 --> 05:39:12.798 align:start position:0%
i use venmo a lot of
 
05:39:14.628 --> 05:39:14.638 align:start position:0%
probably 50 percent
 
05:39:16.230 --> 05:39:16.240 align:start position:0%
of shade right around there paid by
 
05:39:17.590 --> 05:39:17.600 align:start position:0%
credit card
 
05:39:19.030 --> 05:39:19.040 align:start position:0%
debit card
 
05:39:21.270 --> 05:39:21.280 align:start position:0%
um paypal
 
05:39:25.030 --> 05:39:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:27.910 --> 05:39:27.920 align:start position:0%
in one more follow-up
 
05:39:29.670 --> 05:39:29.680 align:start position:0%
no okay no
 
05:39:31.270 --> 05:39:31.280 align:start position:0%
okay no no i'll wait for another
 
05:39:34.310 --> 05:39:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:34.320 --> 05:39:36.868 align:start position:0%
 
well

05:39:36.868 --> 05:39:36.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:38.070 --> 05:39:38.080 align:start position:0%
some people say well they're not going
 
05:39:39.110 --> 05:39:39.120 align:start position:0%
to have the money or we're going to have
 
05:39:40.310 --> 05:39:40.320 align:start position:0%
to make change we're going to have to do
 
05:39:42.150 --> 05:39:42.160 align:start position:0%
this to do that
 
05:39:44.948 --> 05:39:44.958 align:start position:0%
i don't mind making change if i have to
 
05:39:47.350 --> 05:39:47.360 align:start position:0%
whatever it takes
 
05:39:49.910 --> 05:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
i mean with mileage is i think a very
 
05:39:52.548 --> 05:39:52.558 align:start position:0%
fair thing for us to get
 
05:39:54.310 --> 05:39:54.320 align:start position:0%
what we put the time and effort that we
 
05:39:55.990 --> 05:39:56.000 align:start position:0%
put in
 
05:40:01.670 --> 05:40:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:04.788 --> 05:40:04.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:06.470 --> 05:40:06.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman

that will be kicked down the road with
 
05:41:15.030 --> 05:41:15.040 align:start position:0%
as feel-good legislation
 
05:41:16.310 --> 05:41:16.320 align:start position:0%
we as bail commissioners have been
 
05:41:18.310 --> 05:41:18.320 align:start position:0%
before you for the past four years to
 
05:41:19.590 --> 05:41:19.600 align:start position:0%
try and get payment that's already
 
05:41:22.470 --> 05:41:22.480 align:start position:0%
required by law but to no avail everyone
 
05:41:23.750 --> 05:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
that has testified in front of you has
 
05:41:25.590 --> 05:41:25.600 align:start position:0%
agreed the bail commissioners perform a
 
05:41:27.110 --> 05:41:27.120 align:start position:0%
vital function
 
05:41:29.110 --> 05:41:29.120 align:start position:0%
but nobody including the legislature or
 
05:41:31.270 --> 05:41:31.280 align:start position:0%
the judiciary has done anything or
 
05:41:32.150 --> 05:41:32.160 align:start position:0%
followed through to make those
 
05:41:35.830 --> 05:41:35.840 align:start position:0%
worthwhile steps uh actually happen
 
05:41:38.150 --> 05:41:38.160 align:start position:0%
instead there's now a bill to pay
 
05:41:40.150 --> 05:41:40.160 align:start position:0%
for mileage which is nothing more than a
 
05:41:42.070 --> 05:41:42.080 align:start position:0%
feel-good legislation
 
05:41:43.830 --> 05:41:43.840 align:start position:0%
most of the bail commissioners actually
 
05:41:45.190 --> 05:41:45.200 align:start position:0%
all of the bail commissioners that i've
 
05:41:48.390 --> 05:41:48.400 align:start position:0%
spoken with are against this
 
05:41:50.708 --> 05:41:50.718 align:start position:0%
not so much for against mileage but
 
05:41:52.150 --> 05:41:52.160 align:start position:0%
because they aren't paid the forty
 
05:41:52.160 --> 05:41:53.110 align:start position:0%
because they aren't paid the forty
dollars

05:41:53.110 --> 05:41:53.120 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
05:41:54.390 --> 05:41:54.400 align:start position:0%
there are people and you'll hear from
 
05:41:54.400 --> 05:41:55.190 align:start position:0%
there are people and you'll hear from
one

05:41:55.190 --> 05:41:55.200 align:start position:0%
one
 
05:41:57.110 --> 05:41:57.120 align:start position:0%
that are out twenty thirty forty
 
05:41:59.110 --> 05:41:59.120 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
05:42:00.788 --> 05:42:00.798 align:start position:0%
for coming out getting out at two
 
05:42:03.830 --> 05:42:03.840 align:start position:0%
o'clock in the morning to set bail
 
05:42:05.990 --> 05:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
the mileage is a feel-good thing it's
 
05:42:08.070 --> 05:42:08.080 align:start position:0%
not it's it's it's not resolving a
 
05:42:10.310 --> 05:42:10.320 align:start position:0%
problem you've not re you have tried to
 
05:42:12.230 --> 05:42:12.240 align:start position:0%
resolve the problem the problem still
 
05:42:15.350 --> 05:42:15.360 align:start position:0%
exists the court does nothing for us
 
05:42:17.910 --> 05:42:17.920 align:start position:0%
and the statute does nothing as well
 
05:42:17.920 --> 05:42:19.270 align:start position:0%
and the statute does nothing as well
um

05:42:19.270 --> 05:42:19.280 align:start position:0%

so they'll we can download the the forms
 
05:43:11.350 --> 05:43:11.360 align:start position:0%
online and then we have to print them

uh cash bails we have to if we can't
 
05:43:23.350 --> 05:43:23.360 align:start position:0%
bring them to the court we then have to
 
05:43:27.590 --> 05:43:27.600 align:start position:0%
go to the post office or bank buy a
 
05:43:29.910 --> 05:43:29.920 align:start position:0%

all right thank you
 
05:43:51.910 --> 05:43:51.920 align:start position:0%
representative panalakis
 
05:43:53.830 --> 05:43:53.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
05:43:57.350 --> 05:43:57.360 align:start position:0%
do you have to give them bail
 
05:43:57.360 --> 05:43:59.830 align:start position:0%
do you have to give them bail
well

05:43:59.830 --> 05:43:59.840 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:44:03.430 --> 05:44:03.440 align:start position:0%
it depends um we can cash bail we can uh
 
05:44:05.830 --> 05:44:05.840 align:start position:0%
send them to we can lock them up for
 
05:44:08.070 --> 05:44:08.080 align:start position:0%
offenses uh domestic violence offenses
 
05:44:10.150 --> 05:44:10.160 align:start position:0%
or other things like that the job of the
 
05:44:12.548 --> 05:44:12.558 align:start position:0%
bail commissioners to ensure that a they
 
05:44:13.750 --> 05:44:13.760 align:start position:0%
show up for court and they're not a
 
05:44:15.590 --> 05:44:15.600 align:start position:0%
threat to themselves or others other
 
05:44:17.270 --> 05:44:17.280 align:start position:0%
than that just because they don't have
 
05:44:17.280 --> 05:44:18.230 align:start position:0%
than that just because they don't have
money

05:44:18.230 --> 05:44:18.240 align:start position:0%
money
 
05:44:20.390 --> 05:44:20.400 align:start position:0%
does not mean that we can't bail them
 
05:44:22.390 --> 05:44:22.400 align:start position:0%
so we have to allow them and then we we
 
05:44:24.150 --> 05:44:24.160 align:start position:0%
might give them envelope say here pay
 
05:44:26.548 --> 05:44:26.558 align:start position:0%
this you know send this bring this back
 
05:44:29.590 --> 05:44:29.600 align:start position:0%
to the pd i actually write it in as a as
 
05:44:32.390 --> 05:44:32.400 align:start position:0%
a an order that they have to pay me i
 
05:44:34.230 --> 05:44:34.240 align:start position:0%
i come up with a date that says you know
 
05:44:35.750 --> 05:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
when's when can you bring me the forty
 
05:44:35.760 --> 05:44:36.708 align:start position:0%
when's when can you bring me the forty
dollars

05:44:36.708 --> 05:44:36.718 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
05:44:36.718 --> 05:44:37.910 align:start position:0%
dollars
um

05:44:37.910 --> 05:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:44:40.788 --> 05:44:40.798 align:start position:0%
and some do some don't
 
05:44:43.110 --> 05:44:43.120 align:start position:0%
a lot of judges don't allow
 
05:44:45.670 --> 05:44:45.680 align:start position:0%
them to the bail commissioners to charge
 
05:44:48.948 --> 05:44:48.958 align:start position:0%
criminally for theft of services
 
05:44:50.390 --> 05:44:50.400 align:start position:0%
other judges
 
05:44:51.910 --> 05:44:51.920 align:start position:0%
have said that you can but nobody's done
 
05:44:53.510 --> 05:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
it yet
 
05:44:55.990 --> 05:44:56.000 align:start position:0%
but that was looked dimly before uh by
 
05:44:57.990 --> 05:44:58.000 align:start position:0%
the court on on bail commissioners doing
 
05:44:59.190 --> 05:44:59.200 align:start position:0%
that i've been involved in law
 
05:45:00.948 --> 05:45:00.958 align:start position:0%
enforcement for 30 years so i've i've
 
05:45:02.150 --> 05:45:02.160 align:start position:0%
seen a lot of
 
05:45:04.390 --> 05:45:04.400 align:start position:0%
this happen in the past
 
05:45:06.470 --> 05:45:06.480 align:start position:0%
could i have a follow-up maybe i should
 
05:45:09.990 --> 05:45:10.000 align:start position:0%
have phrased this differently okay
 
05:45:13.110 --> 05:45:13.120 align:start position:0%
do you have to let them go
 
05:45:14.708 --> 05:45:14.718 align:start position:0%
say fail them
 
05:45:17.190 --> 05:45:17.200 align:start position:0%
is it something that you have to do
 
05:45:19.670 --> 05:45:19.680 align:start position:0%
or you do it and allow them
 
05:45:23.030 --> 05:45:23.040 align:start position:0%
to owe it to you we have to we can't not
 
05:45:24.310 --> 05:45:24.320 align:start position:0%
bail somebody because they don't have
 
05:45:27.990 --> 05:45:28.000 align:start position:0%
the feed okay thank you yes ma'am yep
 
05:45:29.350 --> 05:45:29.360 align:start position:0%
question um
 
05:45:31.030 --> 05:45:31.040 align:start position:0%
from the chair
 
05:45:34.310 --> 05:45:34.320 align:start position:0%
does the court ever order
 
05:45:36.948 --> 05:45:36.958 align:start position:0%
your reimbursement as part of a fine or
 
05:45:39.110 --> 05:45:39.120 align:start position:0%
part of anything in the sentencing no
 
05:45:41.910 --> 05:45:41.920 align:start position:0%
sir i've not seen that happen they also
 
05:45:44.070 --> 05:45:44.080 align:start position:0%
you you when you wrote the statute last
 
05:45:45.430 --> 05:45:45.440 align:start position:0%
time you said that they're supposed to
 
05:45:45.440 --> 05:45:46.310 align:start position:0%
time you said that they're supposed to
pay

05:45:46.310 --> 05:45:46.320 align:start position:0%
pay
 
05:45:48.150 --> 05:45:48.160 align:start position:0%
as they could have you know as as would
 
05:45:50.310 --> 05:45:50.320 align:start position:0%
it allow
 
05:45:52.310 --> 05:45:52.320 align:start position:0%
and or they should have indigency
 
05:45:54.070 --> 05:45:54.080 align:start position:0%
hearings and to my knowledge and to the
 
05:45:55.990 --> 05:45:56.000 align:start position:0%
other bail commissioners i've spoken to
 
05:45:58.230 --> 05:45:58.240 align:start position:0%
none of that has happened
 
05:46:00.628 --> 05:46:00.638 align:start position:0%
they used to
 
05:46:03.030 --> 05:46:03.040 align:start position:0%
judges used to say you're the the bail
 
05:46:05.030 --> 05:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
commissioner go get the money and bring
 
05:46:06.708 --> 05:46:06.718 align:start position:0%
it back before you leave the court um
 
05:46:08.948 --> 05:46:08.958 align:start position:0%
but evidently that was squashed by
 
05:46:11.430 --> 05:46:11.440 align:start position:0%
um either the aoc or
 
05:46:13.510 --> 05:46:13.520 align:start position:0%
their bosses
 
05:46:16.628 --> 05:46:16.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:18.948 --> 05:46:18.958 align:start position:0%
representative gathering
 
05:46:18.958 --> 05:46:19.910 align:start position:0%
representative gathering
um

05:46:19.910 --> 05:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:46:21.190 --> 05:46:21.200 align:start position:0%
i don't know if there's a question
 
05:46:21.200 --> 05:46:21.990 align:start position:0%
i don't know if there's a question
though

05:46:21.990 --> 05:46:22.000 align:start position:0%
though
 
05:46:23.750 --> 05:46:23.760 align:start position:0%
can i make a comment
 
05:46:26.150 --> 05:46:26.160 align:start position:0%
does it have to be a question um
 
05:46:28.230 --> 05:46:28.240 align:start position:0%
would you believe i had a conversation
 
05:46:30.948 --> 05:46:30.958 align:start position:0%
with the senator
 
05:46:34.470 --> 05:46:34.480 align:start position:0%
and um she said that um
 
05:46:36.788 --> 05:46:36.798 align:start position:0%
the bill that we passed before the folks
 
05:46:38.310 --> 05:46:38.320 align:start position:0%
never got the money and one of the
 
05:46:41.670 --> 05:46:41.680 align:start position:0%
reasons was that 10 of the money um
 
05:46:44.390 --> 05:46:44.400 align:start position:0%
they had to cut their budget 10 percent
 
05:46:45.670 --> 05:46:45.680 align:start position:0%

or an average bail amount that
 
05:47:33.990 --> 05:47:34.000 align:start position:0%
a bail commissioner might have to
 
05:47:35.670 --> 05:47:35.680 align:start position:0%
provide for somebody
 
05:47:37.430 --> 05:47:37.440 align:start position:0%
it could range personal recognizance
 
05:47:39.030 --> 05:47:39.040 align:start position:0%
bail where there's no money but you have
 
05:47:40.948 --> 05:47:40.958 align:start position:0%

for clarification
 
05:48:01.510 --> 05:48:01.520 align:start position:0%
then you or another bail commissioner
 
05:48:02.628 --> 05:48:02.638 align:start position:0%
might have
 
05:48:05.030 --> 05:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
i don't know what you'd call it loaned
 
05:48:06.868 --> 05:48:06.878 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars for someone to be

don't get paid
 
05:48:13.910 --> 05:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
we don't we don't collect that the
 
05:48:16.948 --> 05:48:16.958 align:start position:0%
statute allows us to get forty dollars
 
05:48:18.868 --> 05:48:18.878 align:start position:0%
for each bale that we set
 
05:48:20.470 --> 05:48:20.480 align:start position:0%

05:48:26.628 --> 05:48:26.638 align:start position:0%
recourse for us to receive that payment
 
05:48:26.638 --> 05:48:32.628 align:start position:0%
recourse for us to receive that payment
back

05:48:32.628 --> 05:48:32.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:36.788 --> 05:48:36.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:39.270 --> 05:48:39.280 align:start position:0%
thank you yes sir if the chair may
 
05:48:41.110 --> 05:48:41.120 align:start position:0%
inquire with the question i do apologize
 
05:48:45.590 --> 05:48:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:47.510 --> 05:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
as a member as a
 
05:48:49.430 --> 05:48:49.440 align:start position:0%
bail commissioner
 
05:48:51.270 --> 05:48:51.280 align:start position:0%
what what are you classified as an
 
05:48:52.788 --> 05:48:52.798 align:start position:0%
employee independent contra what's the
 
05:48:52.798 --> 05:48:54.548 align:start position:0%
employee independent contra what's the
classification

05:48:54.548 --> 05:48:54.558 align:start position:0%
classification
 
05:48:57.350 --> 05:48:57.360 align:start position:0%
we are classified as a contract employee
 
05:48:59.270 --> 05:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
we're a contractor we're not an employee
 
05:49:01.270 --> 05:49:01.280 align:start position:0%
then the court makes sure that we we are
 
05:49:03.350 --> 05:49:03.360 align:start position:0%
not however
 
05:49:05.030 --> 05:49:05.040 align:start position:0%
they give us regulations they give us
 
05:49:06.628 --> 05:49:06.638 align:start position:0%
rules they have a manual for us they
 
05:49:08.708 --> 05:49:08.718 align:start position:0%
make the rules that we can can and can't
 
05:49:08.718 --> 05:49:09.910 align:start position:0%
make the rules that we can can and can't
do

05:49:09.910 --> 05:49:09.920 align:start position:0%
do
 
05:49:12.390 --> 05:49:12.400 align:start position:0%
but um we're not allowed we're not
 
05:49:14.230 --> 05:49:14.240 align:start position:0%
employees of the court
 
05:49:16.390 --> 05:49:16.400 align:start position:0%
and if i may ask for a follow-up
 
05:49:17.990 --> 05:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
question and thank you for taking my
 
05:49:21.190 --> 05:49:21.200 align:start position:0%
questions of course so right on the
 
05:49:23.270 --> 05:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
existing law today if
 
05:49:27.750 --> 05:49:27.760 align:start position:0%
you see the round trip was 25 miles
 
05:49:30.628 --> 05:49:30.638 align:start position:0%
when taxes are filed i is a bail
 
05:49:32.708 --> 05:49:32.718 align:start position:0%
commissioner able to
 
05:49:35.190 --> 05:49:35.200 align:start position:0%
get a tax credit for those
 
05:49:36.708 --> 05:49:36.718 align:start position:0%
miles already
 
05:49:38.310 --> 05:49:38.320 align:start position:0%
i believe so a matter of fact i just
 
05:49:39.830 --> 05:49:39.840 align:start position:0%
gave my stuff to the accountant and i
 
05:49:42.230 --> 05:49:42.240 align:start position:0%
think he said that
 
05:49:48.390 --> 05:49:48.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:50.390 --> 05:49:50.400 align:start position:0%
and can you clarify what that is when
 
05:49:52.070 --> 05:49:52.080 align:start position:0%
you report your miles on your tax return
 
05:49:54.230 --> 05:49:54.240 align:start position:0%
what is that what is that in the form of
 
05:49:58.628 --> 05:49:58.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:00.868 --> 05:50:00.878 align:start position:0%
uh i am financially foolish
 
05:50:02.868 --> 05:50:02.878 align:start position:0%
so i give my stuff to an accountant i
 
05:50:04.230 --> 05:50:04.240 align:start position:0%
give him the mileage that i've
 
05:50:04.240 --> 05:50:05.670 align:start position:0%
give him the mileage that i've
accumulated

05:50:05.670 --> 05:50:05.680 align:start position:0%
accumulated
 
05:50:07.430 --> 05:50:07.440 align:start position:0%
throughout the whole year
 
05:50:09.670 --> 05:50:09.680 align:start position:0%
and he does whatever it is that he does
 
05:50:15.590 --> 05:50:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:16.948 --> 05:50:16.958 align:start position:0%

05:51:44.958 --> 05:51:46.230 align:start position:0%
with the police just so we understand
better

05:51:46.230 --> 05:51:46.240 align:start position:0%

you have what
 
05:51:58.310 --> 05:51:58.320 align:start position:0%
how are you trained or how well
 
05:52:00.788 --> 05:52:00.798 align:start position:0%
you consider whether they there should
 
05:52:00.798 --> 05:52:01.670 align:start position:0%
you consider whether they there should
be

05:52:01.670 --> 05:52:01.680 align:start position:0%
be
 
05:52:04.548 --> 05:52:04.558 align:start position:0%

hearings and things like that
well

05:52:10.708 --> 05:52:10.718 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:52:12.708 --> 05:52:12.718 align:start position:0%
if i just make that's this completely
 
05:52:14.948 --> 05:52:14.958 align:start position:0%
separate bill and another this the
 
05:52:16.628 --> 05:52:16.638 align:start position:0%
witness is not capable of responding to
 
05:52:18.070 --> 05:52:18.080 align:start position:0%
that but
 
05:52:19.990 --> 05:52:20.000 align:start position:0%
i would rule that way outside the
 
05:52:20.000 --> 05:52:21.270 align:start position:0%
i would rule that way outside the
purview

05:52:21.270 --> 05:52:21.280 align:start position:0%
purview
 
05:52:24.070 --> 05:52:24.080 align:start position:0%
that's we are having a work session on
 
05:52:27.190 --> 05:52:27.200 align:start position:0%
senate bill 294 on wednesday
 
05:52:27.200 --> 05:52:27.910 align:start position:0%
senate bill 294 on wednesday
but

05:52:27.910 --> 05:52:27.920 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:52:29.350 --> 05:52:29.360 align:start position:0%
this has to do strictly with the miles
 
05:52:30.628 --> 05:52:30.638 align:start position:0%
reimbursement so let's try to leave the
 
05:52:32.548 --> 05:52:32.558 align:start position:0%
questions to that
 
05:52:33.990 --> 05:52:34.000 align:start position:0%
if we open up that door we'll be here
 
05:52:34.000 --> 05:52:34.830 align:start position:0%
if we open up that door we'll be here
tomorrow

05:52:34.830 --> 05:52:34.840 align:start position:0%
tomorrow
 
05:52:37.270 --> 05:52:37.280 align:start position:0%
morning i also follow orders well so i'm
 
05:52:37.280 --> 05:52:41.510 align:start position:0%
morning i also follow orders well so i'm
good

05:52:41.510 --> 05:52:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:41.520 --> 05:52:43.990 align:start position:0%
 
i

05:52:43.990 --> 05:52:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:45.750 --> 05:52:45.760 align:start position:0%
i just thought even with the mileage if
 
05:52:47.670 --> 05:52:47.680 align:start position:0%
we understand what they did it would be
 
05:52:55.110 --> 05:52:55.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:56.470 --> 05:52:56.480 align:start position:0%
seeing no hands raised i want to thank
 
05:52:57.830 --> 05:52:57.840 align:start position:0%
the witness for his testimony thank you
 
05:52:59.910 --> 05:52:59.920 align:start position:0%
ladies and gentlemen i appreciate it
 
05:53:24.230 --> 05:53:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:25.910 --> 05:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
good afternoon mr chairman and members
 
05:53:27.750 --> 05:53:27.760 align:start position:0%
of the committee for the record my name
 
05:53:30.310 --> 05:53:30.320 align:start position:0%
is paul leary i live at 709 central
 
05:53:32.548 --> 05:53:32.558 align:start position:0%
street in franklin new hampshire i am a
 
05:53:35.030 --> 05:53:35.040 align:start position:0%
bail commissioner and have been so since
 
05:53:37.670 --> 05:53:37.680 align:start position:0%
march the 9th 2016
 
05:53:39.190 --> 05:53:39.200 align:start position:0%
i sit here
 
05:53:41.030 --> 05:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
rather than stand here opposed to the
 
05:53:41.040 --> 05:53:41.990 align:start position:0%
rather than stand here opposed to the
bill

05:53:41.990 --> 05:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:53:44.070 --> 05:53:44.080 align:start position:0%
for the same reasons that
 
05:53:45.750 --> 05:53:45.760 align:start position:0%
mini bayer ketty brought up it's
 
05:53:47.430 --> 05:53:47.440 align:start position:0%
basically feel good
 
05:53:50.150 --> 05:53:50.160 align:start position:0%
my problem is i'm not paid by roughly 32
 
05:53:53.190 --> 05:53:53.200 align:start position:0%
to 38 of the people i bail
 
05:53:55.990 --> 05:53:56.000 align:start position:0%
so the other 62 to 68 depending upon the
 
05:53:56.000 --> 05:53:57.030 align:start position:0%
so the other 62 to 68 depending upon the
year

05:53:57.030 --> 05:53:57.040 align:start position:0%
year
 
05:53:58.310 --> 05:53:58.320 align:start position:0%
are the ones that are going to have to
 
05:54:00.230 --> 05:54:00.240 align:start position:0%
pick up the reason that you're doing
 
05:54:02.390 --> 05:54:02.400 align:start position:0%
this feel good thing
 
05:54:04.470 --> 05:54:04.480 align:start position:0%
my problem because of covert and the
 
05:54:06.390 --> 05:54:06.400 align:start position:0%
lack of bail commissioners
 
05:54:07.750 --> 05:54:07.760 align:start position:0%
my range is
 
05:54:07.760 --> 05:54:09.270 align:start position:0%
my range is
ex

05:54:09.270 --> 05:54:09.280 align:start position:0%
ex
 
05:54:09.280 --> 05:54:10.310 align:start position:0%
ex
grown

05:54:10.310 --> 05:54:10.320 align:start position:0%
grown
 
05:54:12.150 --> 05:54:12.160 align:start position:0%
to four counties
 
05:54:14.510 --> 05:54:14.520 align:start position:0%
i just picked up another one they're
 
05:54:18.548 --> 05:54:18.558 align:start position:0%
61.5 miles from my house
 
05:54:22.948 --> 05:54:22.958 align:start position:0%
so we're looking at 122 123 miles times
 
05:54:25.110 --> 05:54:25.120 align:start position:0%
the standard so basically someone's
 
05:54:27.430 --> 05:54:27.440 align:start position:0%
going to have to pay me an additional 61
 
05:54:29.670 --> 05:54:29.680 align:start position:0%
if i have to go there plus the forty
 
05:54:29.680 --> 05:54:31.590 align:start position:0%
if i have to go there plus the forty
dollars

05:54:31.590 --> 05:54:31.600 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
05:54:33.190 --> 05:54:33.200 align:start position:0%
is that fair to the ones that are
 
05:54:35.430 --> 05:54:35.440 align:start position:0%
actually paying the forty dollars the
 
05:54:37.350 --> 05:54:37.360 align:start position:0%
reason i say this like i say i've been
 
05:54:40.868 --> 05:54:40.878 align:start position:0%
doing this since march 9 2016.
 
05:54:45.430 --> 05:54:45.440 align:start position:0%
i mowed 43 959
 
05:54:48.230 --> 05:54:48.240 align:start position:0%
that i will never see
 
05:54:50.948 --> 05:54:50.958 align:start position:0%
i'm also required when i go there with i
 
05:54:53.750 --> 05:54:53.760 align:start position:0%
have multiple bails for the same person
 
05:54:56.230 --> 05:54:56.240 align:start position:0%
i'm only a lot allowed to charge forty
 
05:54:56.240 --> 05:54:57.510 align:start position:0%
i'm only a lot allowed to charge forty
dollars

05:54:57.510 --> 05:54:57.520 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
05:55:00.070 --> 05:55:00.080 align:start position:0%
the problem is a lot of times our
 
05:55:01.910 --> 05:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
frequent flyers the ones that don't pay
 
05:55:03.030 --> 05:55:03.040 align:start position:0%
me anyway
 
05:55:05.030 --> 05:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
they'll have eight or nine electronic
 
05:55:08.470 --> 05:55:08.480 align:start position:0%
bench warrants each one of them require
 
05:55:11.430 --> 05:55:11.440 align:start position:0%
a set of paperwork so all of a sudden i
 
05:55:13.350 --> 05:55:13.360 align:start position:0%
may be there three and a half to five
 
05:55:15.910 --> 05:55:15.920 align:start position:0%
and a half hours to accomplish this
 
05:55:18.788 --> 05:55:18.798 align:start position:0%
i then leave then i go home
 
05:55:21.030 --> 05:55:21.040 align:start position:0%
then i have to take each one of these
 
05:55:23.270 --> 05:55:23.280 align:start position:0%
put them in an envelope address it put a
 
05:55:25.430 --> 05:55:25.440 align:start position:0%
stamp on it and eventually go to the
 
05:55:27.670 --> 05:55:27.680 align:start position:0%
post office and drop them off if there's
 
05:55:29.590 --> 05:55:29.600 align:start position:0%
any cash involved i have to stop and
 
05:55:31.990 --> 05:55:32.000 align:start position:0%
make a deposit at the bank
 
05:55:34.150 --> 05:55:34.160 align:start position:0%
so the thing is everyone thinks it's
 
05:55:36.230 --> 05:55:36.240 align:start position:0%
just this little tiny sliver sometimes
 
05:55:38.150 --> 05:55:38.160 align:start position:0%
we're giving an awful lot for that forty
 
05:55:38.160 --> 05:55:39.990 align:start position:0%
we're giving an awful lot for that forty
dollars

05:55:39.990 --> 05:55:40.000 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
05:55:42.310 --> 05:55:42.320 align:start position:0%
into speaking about mileage basically
 
05:55:45.510 --> 05:55:45.520 align:start position:0%
this year i've only done 846 but i'm a
 
05:55:47.270 --> 05:55:47.280 align:start position:0%
kind of a heavy user of what we call
 
05:55:49.430 --> 05:55:49.440 align:start position:0%
tele-bail or remote bailing that the
 
05:55:51.910 --> 05:55:51.920 align:start position:0%
court system allowed when covet hit and
 
05:55:53.830 --> 05:55:53.840 align:start position:0%
i think that's part of the reason why my
 
05:55:55.910 --> 05:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
area of coverage has grown
 
05:55:57.590 --> 05:55:57.600 align:start position:0%
but the numbers that are still paying
 
05:55:59.430 --> 05:55:59.440 align:start position:0%
are still floating when i first started
 
05:56:01.910 --> 05:56:01.920 align:start position:0%
judge gordon told me i would receive
 
05:56:04.470 --> 05:56:04.480 align:start position:0%
three out of five paying
 
05:56:06.310 --> 05:56:06.320 align:start position:0%
which is 60
 
05:56:09.510 --> 05:56:09.520 align:start position:0%
and he told me that back in uh late 2015
 
05:56:13.510 --> 05:56:13.520 align:start position:0%
early 2016 so that hasn't changed much
 
05:56:15.110 --> 05:56:15.120 align:start position:0%
the only thing that this is ever going
 
05:56:16.788 --> 05:56:16.798 align:start position:0%
to become fair and equitable for the
 
05:56:18.310 --> 05:56:18.320 align:start position:0%
bail commissioners as you've heard we're
 
05:56:21.430 --> 05:56:21.440 align:start position:0%
the only ones that of the whole process
 
05:56:23.750 --> 05:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
that don't always get paid
 
05:56:26.470 --> 05:56:26.480 align:start position:0%
is that basically every bail
 
05:56:28.150 --> 05:56:28.160 align:start position:0%
form that i write
 
05:56:30.948 --> 05:56:30.958 align:start position:0%
whether it be one two five or seven i
 
05:56:33.110 --> 05:56:33.120 align:start position:0%
get paid forty dollars for each one of
 
05:56:33.120 --> 05:56:35.030 align:start position:0%
get paid forty dollars for each one of
those

05:56:35.030 --> 05:56:35.040 align:start position:0%
those
 
05:56:37.910 --> 05:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
the court pays us every two weeks
 
05:56:40.230 --> 05:56:40.240 align:start position:0%
by the paperwork we turn in the end of
 
05:56:42.628 --> 05:56:42.638 align:start position:0%
the year they give us a 10.99 we remain
 
05:56:44.948 --> 05:56:44.958 align:start position:0%
an agent or a contracted
 
05:56:44.958 --> 05:56:45.990 align:start position:0%
an agent or a contracted
agent

05:56:45.990 --> 05:56:46.000 align:start position:0%
agent
 
05:56:48.548 --> 05:56:48.558 align:start position:0%
with the state we get the 1099 that
 
05:56:51.110 --> 05:56:51.120 align:start position:0%
keeps irs and everyone else happy bail
 
05:56:53.190 --> 05:56:53.200 align:start position:0%
commissioners are getting paid and the
 
05:56:55.190 --> 05:56:55.200 align:start position:0%
thing that really adds frosting to the
 
05:56:57.990 --> 05:56:58.000 align:start position:0%
cake is that the judge can waive
 
05:57:00.708 --> 05:57:00.718 align:start position:0%
my bail commissioner for you 40
 
05:57:03.270 --> 05:57:03.280 align:start position:0%
because the client is indigent i've
 
05:57:05.670 --> 05:57:05.680 align:start position:0%
already given it the office
 
05:57:07.990 --> 05:57:08.000 align:start position:0%
32 to 38 percent
 
05:57:09.270 --> 05:57:09.280 align:start position:0%
now upbeat
 
05:57:11.510 --> 05:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
truth and menu type thing that's only
 
05:57:14.070 --> 05:57:14.080 align:start position:0%
happened once but when it happened it
 
05:57:15.910 --> 05:57:15.920 align:start position:0%
irritated me that it's like you're
 
05:57:18.150 --> 05:57:18.160 align:start position:0%
giving my money away
 
05:57:20.230 --> 05:57:20.240 align:start position:0%
even though the law says i'm entitled to
 
05:57:20.240 --> 05:57:21.190 align:start position:0%
even though the law says i'm entitled to
it

05:57:21.190 --> 05:57:21.200 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:57:24.150 --> 05:57:24.160 align:start position:0%
so that's another challenge and then as
 
05:57:25.990 --> 05:57:26.000 align:start position:0%
they said with the bills that we've had
 
05:57:28.948 --> 05:57:28.958 align:start position:0%
the last few to the extent of available
 
05:57:31.830 --> 05:57:31.840 align:start position:0%
funding utilize all possible means to
 
05:57:34.310 --> 05:57:34.320 align:start position:0%
pay the pay the bail commissioner's fee
 
05:57:36.390 --> 05:57:36.400 align:start position:0%
and shall include written evidence of
 
05:57:39.350 --> 05:57:39.360 align:start position:0%
fee payment in the offender's case file
 
05:57:41.430 --> 05:57:41.440 align:start position:0%
the problem is the court for as long as
 
05:57:43.750 --> 05:57:43.760 align:start position:0%
i can remember has been underfunded so
 
05:57:46.150 --> 05:57:46.160 align:start position:0%
there's never any available funds
 
05:57:47.670 --> 05:57:47.680 align:start position:0%
but i question
 
05:57:50.708 --> 05:57:50.718 align:start position:0%
you you know to use all means possible
 
05:57:52.788 --> 05:57:52.798 align:start position:0%
the judge could order it
 
05:57:55.350 --> 05:57:55.360 align:start position:0%
as part of the fine structure
 
05:57:57.350 --> 05:57:57.360 align:start position:0%
and the first forty dollars instead of
 
05:57:59.670 --> 05:57:59.680 align:start position:0%
us being the last one in the payment fee
 
05:58:03.270 --> 05:58:03.280 align:start position:0%
schedule let us be the first one
 
05:58:05.270 --> 05:58:05.280 align:start position:0%
those are some things that they could do
 
05:58:06.470 --> 05:58:06.480 align:start position:0%
that could help
 
05:58:08.628 --> 05:58:08.638 align:start position:0%
because the thing is this morning i did
 
05:58:11.270 --> 05:58:11.280 align:start position:0%
receive a check through the system
 
05:58:13.270 --> 05:58:13.280 align:start position:0%
but some years i only receive eight or
 
05:58:15.030 --> 05:58:15.040 align:start position:0%
nine from the court
 
05:58:16.788 --> 05:58:16.798 align:start position:0%
so the thing is we're not getting that
 
05:58:18.230 --> 05:58:18.240 align:start position:0%
many where they're going to the court
 
05:58:20.390 --> 05:58:20.400 align:start position:0%
and paying our bail commissioners fees
 
05:58:22.470 --> 05:58:22.480 align:start position:0%
and that's indicated in my numbers i
 
05:58:24.310 --> 05:58:24.320 align:start position:0%
only have one copy and i'll leave mr
 
05:58:25.830 --> 05:58:25.840 align:start position:0%
chairman if you want i will leave that
 
05:58:27.830 --> 05:58:27.840 align:start position:0%
so that you'll have it my breakdown of
 
05:58:30.390 --> 05:58:30.400 align:start position:0%
the mileage all my expenses not my
 
05:58:32.708 --> 05:58:32.718 align:start position:0%
expenses but the number of bails i've
 
05:58:34.310 --> 05:58:34.320 align:start position:0%
done over the time
 
05:58:36.230 --> 05:58:36.240 align:start position:0%
and this is the same testimony i used
 
05:58:39.270 --> 05:58:39.280 align:start position:0%
when we started back on house bill
 
05:58:43.430 --> 05:58:43.440 align:start position:0%
uh excuse me senate bill 772 in 2019 and
 
05:58:45.350 --> 05:58:45.360 align:start position:0%
just been updating this each time as i
 
05:58:47.350 --> 05:58:47.360 align:start position:0%
come back and basically tell you the
 
05:58:49.430 --> 05:58:49.440 align:start position:0%
same thing the only fair and equitable
 
05:58:51.190 --> 05:58:51.200 align:start position:0%
way is that we get paid for everything
 
05:58:52.150 --> 05:58:52.160 align:start position:0%
we write
 
05:58:54.788 --> 05:58:54.798 align:start position:0%
the court pays us and then they get it
 
05:58:56.628 --> 05:58:56.638 align:start position:0%
from the defendant
 
05:58:58.310 --> 05:58:58.320 align:start position:0%
and the thing is eventually hopefully it
 
05:58:59.590 --> 05:58:59.600 align:start position:0%
would be a wash
 
05:59:01.350 --> 05:59:01.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
05:59:03.670 --> 05:59:03.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony and if the
 
05:59:05.350 --> 05:59:05.360 align:start position:0%
chairman inquired with the question and
 
05:59:07.030 --> 05:59:07.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question it's
 
05:59:09.030 --> 05:59:09.040 align:start position:0%
similar to the question i asked the
 
05:59:10.868 --> 05:59:10.878 align:start position:0%
prior witness i'm just not sure if you
 
05:59:12.390 --> 05:59:12.400 align:start position:0%
can answer it
 
05:59:14.868 --> 05:59:14.878 align:start position:0%
as an independent contractor
 
05:59:17.990 --> 05:59:18.000 align:start position:0%
if your miles are recorded
 
05:59:20.548 --> 05:59:20.558 align:start position:0%
when you file your taxes is there a tax
 
05:59:22.948 --> 05:59:22.958 align:start position:0%
credit received from the what exactly
 
05:59:26.150 --> 05:59:26.160 align:start position:0%
tax credit but as you heard vinnie say
 
05:59:27.750 --> 05:59:27.760 align:start position:0%
and one of the representatives kind of
 
05:59:29.990 --> 05:59:30.000 align:start position:0%
concurred i hire an accountant
 
05:59:32.310 --> 05:59:32.320 align:start position:0%
i was i spent almost 35 years in public
 
05:59:34.948 --> 05:59:34.958 align:start position:0%
safety in law enforcement and this is
 
05:59:36.548 --> 05:59:36.558 align:start position:0%
i'm in my seventh year doing this so
 
05:59:39.110 --> 05:59:39.120 align:start position:0%
basically 41 years of doing this stuff
 
05:59:41.270 --> 05:59:41.280 align:start position:0%
but i learned at an early age
 
05:59:43.350 --> 05:59:43.360 align:start position:0%
the irs tax code is way above me but
 
05:59:45.750 --> 05:59:45.760 align:start position:0%
what happens is i have to tell my
 
05:59:45.760 --> 05:59:47.110 align:start position:0%
what happens is i have to tell my
accountant

05:59:47.110 --> 05:59:47.120 align:start position:0%
accountant
 
05:59:49.510 --> 05:59:49.520 align:start position:0%
my car payment how much i registered my
 
05:59:51.190 --> 05:59:51.200 align:start position:0%
vehicle what my insurance is and any
 
05:59:53.270 --> 05:59:53.280 align:start position:0%
expenses on that vehicle
 
05:59:55.510 --> 05:59:55.520 align:start position:0%
then i have to keep track of my bail
 
05:59:58.070 --> 05:59:58.080 align:start position:0%
commissioner miles i also have another
 
05:59:59.830 --> 05:59:59.840 align:start position:0%
business i have to keep track of those
 
06:00:02.310 --> 06:00:02.320 align:start position:0%
miles and then personal miles i give
 
06:00:04.230 --> 06:00:04.240 align:start position:0%
that to the account the accountant goes
 
06:00:06.150 --> 06:00:06.160 align:start position:0%
through and puts okay that's a business
 
06:00:08.070 --> 06:00:08.080 align:start position:0%
it's a business expense
 
06:00:09.590 --> 06:00:09.600 align:start position:0%
and there's a line in there i think it's
 
06:00:12.230 --> 06:00:12.240 align:start position:0%
schedule c if i remember correctly that
 
06:00:13.990 --> 06:00:14.000 align:start position:0%
they list all of that stuff on and the
 
06:00:16.390 --> 06:00:16.400 align:start position:0%
breakdown and the expenses are there
 
06:00:18.708 --> 06:00:18.718 align:start position:0%
but still it's
 
06:00:21.350 --> 06:00:21.360 align:start position:0%
it and here's the thing
 
06:00:24.070 --> 06:00:24.080 align:start position:0%
i have to sit down and figure now to
 
06:00:25.670 --> 06:00:25.680 align:start position:0%
keep people happy
 
06:00:28.708 --> 06:00:28.718 align:start position:0%
where do i get my mileage figure from
 
06:00:30.948 --> 06:00:30.958 align:start position:0%
the odometer or do i use a map program
 
06:00:33.430 --> 06:00:33.440 align:start position:0%
if i use a map program what map program
 
06:00:35.110 --> 06:00:35.120 align:start position:0%
but at three o'clock in the morning out
 
06:00:37.350 --> 06:00:37.360 align:start position:0%
in the middle of the woods with nowhere
 
06:00:39.670 --> 06:00:39.680 align:start position:0%
it's been probably at least 60 years
 
06:00:41.190 --> 06:00:41.200 align:start position:0%
since i carried one of those little
 
06:00:43.750 --> 06:00:43.760 align:start position:0%
change making things on my belt but it's
 
06:00:45.390 --> 06:00:45.400 align:start position:0%
like when we get a bale
 
06:00:47.910 --> 06:00:47.920 align:start position:0%
143 dollars and
 
06:00:50.708 --> 06:00:50.718 align:start position:0%
32 cents
 
06:00:54.150 --> 06:00:54.160 align:start position:0%
guys got 150 dollars
 
06:00:56.470 --> 06:00:56.480 align:start position:0%
i gotta make change i don't carry
 
06:00:58.628 --> 06:00:58.638 align:start position:0%
pennies nickels and dimes anymore in my
 
06:01:01.510 --> 06:01:01.520 align:start position:0%
pocket i may have a few quarters we go
 
06:01:02.708 --> 06:01:02.718 align:start position:0%
through the drawers in the police
 
06:01:05.190 --> 06:01:05.200 align:start position:0%
department trying to find that so i mean
 
06:01:06.628 --> 06:01:06.638 align:start position:0%
now we're going to complicate it even
 
06:01:09.110 --> 06:01:09.120 align:start position:0%
more with the mileage so i mean this you
 
06:01:10.628 --> 06:01:10.638 align:start position:0%
know when you start looking at the
 
06:01:12.788 --> 06:01:12.798 align:start position:0%
totality of what you're doing it may
 
06:01:14.948 --> 06:01:14.958 align:start position:0%
look good on the surface but in reality
 
06:01:17.350 --> 06:01:17.360 align:start position:0%
and getting the rubber meeting the road
 
06:01:18.868 --> 06:01:18.878 align:start position:0%
i don't think so
 
06:01:21.510 --> 06:01:21.520 align:start position:0%
sorry i want a little outside of that
 
06:01:24.948 --> 06:01:24.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:27.430 --> 06:01:27.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr
 
06:01:27.440 --> 06:01:27.830 align:start position:0%
thank you mr
with chairman

06:01:27.830 --> 06:01:27.840 align:start position:0%
with chairman
 
06:01:30.390 --> 06:01:30.400 align:start position:0%
amount of money that use
 
06:01:33.270 --> 06:01:33.280 align:start position:0%
you is owed to you now did you say there
 
06:01:36.150 --> 06:01:36.160 align:start position:0%
is no way for you to collect it
 
06:01:37.990 --> 06:01:38.000 align:start position:0%
to the best of my job knowledge and
 
06:01:39.990 --> 06:01:40.000 align:start position:0%
belief at this juncture of time and if
 
06:01:41.190 --> 06:01:41.200 align:start position:0%
it sounds like i've been dealing with
 
06:01:43.590 --> 06:01:43.600 align:start position:0%
attorneys too long yes uh
 
06:01:45.510 --> 06:01:45.520 align:start position:0%
i do not believe so
 
06:01:47.510 --> 06:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
because i was told i can't take him for
 
06:01:49.510 --> 06:01:49.520 align:start position:0%
theft services even though the form says
 
06:01:52.150 --> 06:01:52.160 align:start position:0%
it the court will not entertain it
 
06:01:58.628 --> 06:01:58.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:02.070 --> 06:02:02.080 align:start position:0%
and this is the state is telling you
 
06:02:05.910 --> 06:02:05.920 align:start position:0%
that you have to get them bail
 
06:02:07.910 --> 06:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
the way it's written if the phone rings
 
06:02:10.708 --> 06:02:10.718 align:start position:0%
and i answer the phone
 
06:02:12.390 --> 06:02:12.400 align:start position:0%
the last thing i want to hear out of
 
06:02:15.270 --> 06:02:15.280 align:start position:0%
them is they don't have the fee
 
06:02:17.190 --> 06:02:17.200 align:start position:0%
because once they do that i'm stuck i
 
06:02:18.788 --> 06:02:18.798 align:start position:0%
have to go
 
06:02:20.390 --> 06:02:20.400 align:start position:0%
if they don't tell me that and i make
 
06:02:22.150 --> 06:02:22.160 align:start position:0%
the decision being on where the location
 
06:02:24.470 --> 06:02:24.480 align:start position:0%
the time the weather and the offense
 
06:02:25.990 --> 06:02:26.000 align:start position:0%
it's like nah you can write in my hand
 
06:02:28.230 --> 06:02:28.240 align:start position:0%
summons i don't really need to come out
 
06:02:30.070 --> 06:02:30.080 align:start position:0%
and then i can say no but if they tell
 
06:02:31.510 --> 06:02:31.520 align:start position:0%
me they don't have the money i'm not
 
06:02:38.390 --> 06:02:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:42.310 --> 06:02:42.320 align:start position:0%
a lot of phrases me
 
06:02:44.788 --> 06:02:44.798 align:start position:0%
you have to go out the state requires
 
06:02:47.350 --> 06:02:47.360 align:start position:0%
you to give them this fail
 
06:02:49.590 --> 06:02:49.600 align:start position:0%
and yet we do not give you
 
06:02:53.430 --> 06:02:53.440 align:start position:0%
any way to collect it is that correct
 
06:02:56.230 --> 06:02:56.240 align:start position:0%
at least in practice ma'am
 
06:02:58.230 --> 06:02:58.240 align:start position:0%
okay thank you in writing i'm sure it
 
06:03:00.230 --> 06:03:00.240 align:start position:0%
allows us somehow or other but in the
 
06:03:04.830 --> 06:03:04.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:08.390 --> 06:03:08.400 align:start position:0%
you representative boardney
 
06:03:10.070 --> 06:03:10.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman well thank you for
 
06:03:11.510 --> 06:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
06:03:11.520 --> 06:03:12.470 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

06:03:12.470 --> 06:03:12.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:03:15.510 --> 06:03:15.520 align:start position:0%
when you go to uh
 
06:03:15.520 --> 06:03:16.390 align:start position:0%
when you go to uh
um

06:03:16.390 --> 06:03:16.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:03:18.548 --> 06:03:18.558 align:start position:0%
serve a cl defendant
 
06:03:20.868 --> 06:03:20.878 align:start position:0%
do you ever have more than one defendant
 
06:03:22.628 --> 06:03:22.638 align:start position:0%
at that time
 
06:03:24.788 --> 06:03:24.798 align:start position:0%
uh yes the most i've had at one time was
 
06:03:28.628 --> 06:03:28.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:30.708 --> 06:03:30.718 align:start position:0%
uh so if this bill were to become a law
 
06:03:32.390 --> 06:03:32.400 align:start position:0%
when actually
 
06:03:36.628 --> 06:03:36.638 align:start position:0%
maori was actually rewarded someday um
 
06:03:39.350 --> 06:03:39.360 align:start position:0%
would you receive mountish for
 
06:03:42.070 --> 06:03:42.080 align:start position:0%
one trip or would it be for nine trips
 
06:03:44.868 --> 06:03:44.878 align:start position:0%
and who would pay them outage
 
06:03:47.110 --> 06:03:47.120 align:start position:0%
it would be one trip and whoever had the
 
06:03:49.510 --> 06:03:49.520 align:start position:0%
misfortunes of being the first one or
 
06:03:51.670 --> 06:03:51.680 align:start position:0%
the last one depending upon how the day
 
06:03:51.680 --> 06:03:52.548 align:start position:0%
the last one depending upon how the day
went

06:03:52.548 --> 06:03:52.558 align:start position:0%
went
 
06:03:57.990 --> 06:03:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:59.750 --> 06:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
representative thank you mr chairman
 
06:04:01.350 --> 06:04:01.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question you you
 
06:04:03.990 --> 06:04:04.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned that your uh territory had
 
06:04:05.910 --> 06:04:05.920 align:start position:0%
recently expanded did you get the
 
06:04:07.990 --> 06:04:08.000 align:start position:0%
impression that that was because there
 
06:04:09.910 --> 06:04:09.920 align:start position:0%
were not enough people
 
06:04:12.390 --> 06:04:12.400 align:start position:0%
available to do the work
 
06:04:13.990 --> 06:04:14.000 align:start position:0%
do you want me to answer that what you
 
06:04:15.110 --> 06:04:15.120 align:start position:0%
want to hear do you want me to be
 
06:04:17.910 --> 06:04:17.920 align:start position:0%
truthful truthful please truthful is
 
06:04:21.110 --> 06:04:21.120 align:start position:0%
before covert we had over 150 bail
 
06:04:23.030 --> 06:04:23.040 align:start position:0%
commissioners now we're down in the 90s
 
06:04:24.948 --> 06:04:24.958 align:start position:0%
or high 80s
 
06:04:27.110 --> 06:04:27.120 align:start position:0%
the reason frankly is if anyone asks us
 
06:04:29.350 --> 06:04:29.360 align:start position:0%
it's like what are you crazy
 
06:04:30.708 --> 06:04:30.718 align:start position:0%
to do it
 
06:04:33.190 --> 06:04:33.200 align:start position:0%
the thing is we have expenses
 
06:04:34.788 --> 06:04:34.798 align:start position:0%
like when you start out if you don't
 
06:04:36.788 --> 06:04:36.798 align:start position:0%
have it you end up going and getting
 
06:04:38.548 --> 06:04:38.558 align:start position:0%
some kind of a tablet some kind of a
 
06:04:40.788 --> 06:04:40.798 align:start position:0%
printer so that you can have the ability
 
06:04:42.390 --> 06:04:42.400 align:start position:0%
to go because most police departments
 
06:04:44.788 --> 06:04:44.798 align:start position:0%
you go into you can't use their systems
 
06:04:46.788 --> 06:04:46.798 align:start position:0%
there's no place for you to log in so
 
06:04:48.310 --> 06:04:48.320 align:start position:0%
the thing is you have a lot of startup
 
06:04:50.708 --> 06:04:50.718 align:start position:0%
expenses in the beginning and i mean i
 
06:04:52.948 --> 06:04:52.958 align:start position:0%
just hit starting into my seventh year i
 
06:04:55.230 --> 06:04:55.240 align:start position:0%
had to replace my printer that was
 
06:04:57.750 --> 06:04:57.760 align:start position:0%
415 dollars
 
06:04:59.510 --> 06:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
so the thing is but at least i got five
 
06:05:01.110 --> 06:05:01.120 align:start position:0%
years out of the first one but the thing
 
06:05:03.670 --> 06:05:03.680 align:start position:0%
is it's still all expenses that we pick
 
06:05:08.230 --> 06:05:08.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:10.070 --> 06:05:10.080 align:start position:0%
representative sue newman
 
06:05:12.868 --> 06:05:12.878 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
06:05:15.510 --> 06:05:15.520 align:start position:0%
are you aware do other states do
 
06:05:18.150 --> 06:05:18.160 align:start position:0%
anything like this ma'am to be frank i
 
06:05:19.830 --> 06:05:19.840 align:start position:0%
have enough problems taking care of what
 
06:05:21.350 --> 06:05:21.360 align:start position:0%
i do here in new hampshire i don't care
 
06:05:22.948 --> 06:05:22.958 align:start position:0%
what someone does elsewhere with all due
 
06:05:22.958 --> 06:05:24.070 align:start position:0%
what someone does elsewhere with all due
respect

06:05:24.070 --> 06:05:24.080 align:start position:0%
respect
 
06:05:26.470 --> 06:05:26.480 align:start position:0%
that's not my job follow just a
 
06:05:26.480 --> 06:05:27.510 align:start position:0%
that's not my job follow just a
follow-up

06:05:27.510 --> 06:05:27.520 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
06:05:30.230 --> 06:05:30.240 align:start position:0%
realtors are independent contractors but
 
06:05:32.310 --> 06:05:32.320 align:start position:0%
there is a national association of
 
06:05:32.320 --> 06:05:33.430 align:start position:0%
there is a national association of
realtors

06:05:33.430 --> 06:05:33.440 align:start position:0%
realtors
 
06:05:36.948 --> 06:05:36.958 align:start position:0%
do you have any kind of an association
 
06:05:38.470 --> 06:05:38.480 align:start position:0%
to the best of my knowledge and belief
 
06:05:40.150 --> 06:05:40.160 align:start position:0%
at this juncture of time the answer to
 
06:05:42.788 --> 06:05:42.798 align:start position:0%
that is no but however each state how
 
06:05:45.110 --> 06:05:45.120 align:start position:0%
they call us in the job functionality we
 
06:05:47.430 --> 06:05:47.440 align:start position:0%
do are different so it would be an
 
06:05:48.948 --> 06:05:48.958 align:start position:0%
interest it's not like realtors where
 
06:05:50.150 --> 06:05:50.160 align:start position:0%
you're selling
 
06:05:52.150 --> 06:05:52.160 align:start position:0%
you know or
 
06:05:55.110 --> 06:05:55.120 align:start position:0%
moving real estate as it depends upon
 
06:05:56.868 --> 06:05:56.878 align:start position:0%
the court system the state setups and
 
06:05:58.310 --> 06:05:58.320 align:start position:0%
all of that yeah so each one of those
 
06:05:59.830 --> 06:05:59.840 align:start position:0%
could be different representative thank
 
06:05:59.840 --> 06:06:02.070 align:start position:0%
could be different representative thank
you

06:06:02.070 --> 06:06:02.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:03.590 --> 06:06:03.600 align:start position:0%
representative green
 
06:06:05.430 --> 06:06:05.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
06:06:08.070 --> 06:06:08.080 align:start position:0%
my question you stated earlier that it
 
06:06:10.470 --> 06:06:10.480 align:start position:0%
would be better if they put your 40 or
 
06:06:12.230 --> 06:06:12.240 align:start position:0%
whatever the amount be
 
06:06:13.670 --> 06:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
in with the fine
 
06:06:15.590 --> 06:06:15.600 align:start position:0%
and the court would collect it and then
 
06:06:17.110 --> 06:06:17.120 align:start position:0%
give it to you
 
06:06:18.548 --> 06:06:18.558 align:start position:0%
if that was to be the way they were
 
06:06:20.708 --> 06:06:20.718 align:start position:0%
caught wanted to do it
 
06:06:23.110 --> 06:06:23.120 align:start position:0%
but the thing is the caveat has to be we
 
06:06:25.670 --> 06:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
get the money first not last because
 
06:06:28.628 --> 06:06:28.638 align:start position:0%
currently if they owe a fine of like 700
 
06:06:28.638 --> 06:06:29.990 align:start position:0%
currently if they owe a fine of like 700
800

06:06:29.990 --> 06:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
800
 
06:06:31.750 --> 06:06:31.760 align:start position:0%
the court gets all of that and then our
 
06:06:39.270 --> 06:06:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:40.708 --> 06:06:40.718 align:start position:0%
representative roy
 
06:06:42.230 --> 06:06:42.240 align:start position:0%
thank you uh thanks for taking the
 
06:06:42.240 --> 06:06:43.350 align:start position:0%
thank you uh thanks for taking the
question

06:06:43.350 --> 06:06:43.360 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:06:45.750 --> 06:06:45.760 align:start position:0%
have you noticed the change
 
06:06:47.510 --> 06:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
are you getting paid less often than you
 
06:06:48.788 --> 06:06:48.798 align:start position:0%
used to say
 
06:06:50.628 --> 06:06:50.638 align:start position:0%
70 years ago has it been pretty much
 
06:06:53.030 --> 06:06:53.040 align:start position:0%
consistent since you started is like i
 
06:06:55.030 --> 06:06:55.040 align:start position:0%
said judge gordon told me expect getting
 
06:06:57.510 --> 06:06:57.520 align:start position:0%
three out of five i know my clientele
 
06:06:59.270 --> 06:06:59.280 align:start position:0%
base at least when i first started in
 
06:07:00.948 --> 06:07:00.958 align:start position:0%
the you know around northfield franklin
 
06:07:03.110 --> 06:07:03.120 align:start position:0%
tilton san beniton they're not affluent
 
06:07:05.750 --> 06:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
communities in most cases so the thing
 
06:07:07.830 --> 06:07:07.840 align:start position:0%
was that was the reality of it but now
 
06:07:09.110 --> 06:07:09.120 align:start position:0%
like i say
 
06:07:10.548 --> 06:07:10.558 align:start position:0%
it's grown
 
06:07:12.948 --> 06:07:12.958 align:start position:0%
kind of but when i look at my numbers
 
06:07:14.628 --> 06:07:14.638 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to leave the sheet with i
 
06:07:17.670 --> 06:07:17.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:19.670 --> 06:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
it's basically the same i float between
 
06:07:22.708 --> 06:07:22.718 align:start position:0%
62 and 68 that are paying
 
06:07:24.390 --> 06:07:24.400 align:start position:0%
but i'm also with a friend of mine
 
06:07:26.070 --> 06:07:26.080 align:start position:0%
that's just over and a couple of towns
 
06:07:28.548 --> 06:07:28.558 align:start position:0%
over he's only collecting 48 to 50 of
 
06:07:30.948 --> 06:07:30.958 align:start position:0%
the time so i think it all depends upon
 
06:07:32.868 --> 06:07:32.878 align:start position:0%
where you're where you're working and
 
06:07:35.510 --> 06:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
what the you know the clientele base is
 
06:07:37.110 --> 06:07:37.120 align:start position:0%
i have a lot of what i call frequent
 
06:07:39.350 --> 06:07:39.360 align:start position:0%
flyers i have some that haven't paid me
 
06:07:40.788 --> 06:07:40.798 align:start position:0%
in seven years that i've been bailing
 
06:07:43.270 --> 06:07:43.280 align:start position:0%
them so we're on first name basis tell
 
06:07:44.470 --> 06:07:44.480 align:start position:0%
them i don't want to see them again and
 
06:07:46.628 --> 06:07:46.638 align:start position:0%
sure enough three four weeks later it's
 
06:07:49.110 --> 06:07:49.120 align:start position:0%
back again so usually sometimes i bail
 
06:07:50.948 --> 06:07:50.958 align:start position:0%
them four or five times a year
 
06:07:50.958 --> 06:07:57.910 align:start position:0%
them four or five times a year
so

06:07:57.910 --> 06:07:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:59.430 --> 06:07:59.440 align:start position:0%
see no hands raise one thank the witness
 
06:08:02.150 --> 06:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
for his testimony thank you mr chairman
 
06:08:16.868 --> 06:08:16.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:19.190 --> 06:08:19.200 align:start position:0%
good afternoon everybody mr chair
 
06:08:20.628 --> 06:08:20.638 align:start position:0%
my name is trixie lafave and i'm from
 
06:08:22.708 --> 06:08:22.718 align:start position:0%
londonderry uh i've been a bail
 
06:08:24.788 --> 06:08:24.798 align:start position:0%
commissioner for 13 years
 
06:08:27.510 --> 06:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
um and i'm here again to speak about
 
06:08:29.670 --> 06:08:29.680 align:start position:0%
senate bill 361 in opposition to the
 
06:08:29.680 --> 06:08:31.510 align:start position:0%
senate bill 361 in opposition to the
bill

06:08:31.510 --> 06:08:31.520 align:start position:0%
bill
 
06:08:33.910 --> 06:08:33.920 align:start position:0%
this bill as we all have been speaking
 
06:08:33.920 --> 06:08:35.190 align:start position:0%
this bill as we all have been speaking
um

06:08:35.190 --> 06:08:35.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:08:37.030 --> 06:08:37.040 align:start position:0%
is intended to provide reimbursement for
 
06:08:38.470 --> 06:08:38.480 align:start position:0%
mileage but doesn't give us any
 
06:08:40.868 --> 06:08:40.878 align:start position:0%
enforcement for this collection
 
06:08:43.110 --> 06:08:43.120 align:start position:0%
which is the same issue that we have
 
06:08:44.310 --> 06:08:44.320 align:start position:0%
with the forty dollar bail
 
06:08:46.310 --> 06:08:46.320 align:start position:0%
commissioner's fee we do not have any
 
06:08:48.230 --> 06:08:48.240 align:start position:0%
enforcement personal enforcement to
 
06:08:50.150 --> 06:08:50.160 align:start position:0%
collect this fee
 
06:08:52.150 --> 06:08:52.160 align:start position:0%
the bail commissioner community we are
 
06:08:54.310 --> 06:08:54.320 align:start position:0%
no further along in gaining support from
 
06:08:56.628 --> 06:08:56.638 align:start position:0%
the legislative body for this particular
 
06:09:00.390 --> 06:09:00.400 align:start position:0%
problem we've been here since 2019 every
 
06:09:03.430 --> 06:09:03.440 align:start position:0%
single year i have given testimony over
 
06:09:06.628 --> 06:09:06.638 align:start position:0%
and over again trying to get something
 
06:09:08.230 --> 06:09:08.240 align:start position:0%
to benefit the bail commissioner
 
06:09:10.708 --> 06:09:10.718 align:start position:0%
community just to give us to ensure that
 
06:09:12.948 --> 06:09:12.958 align:start position:0%
we get that forty dollars paid
 
06:09:14.548 --> 06:09:14.558 align:start position:0%
of the fork bail commissioners that
 
06:09:17.670 --> 06:09:17.680 align:start position:0%
spoke at the january hearing three spoke
 
06:09:20.310 --> 06:09:20.320 align:start position:0%
against this proposal and um i'm one of
 
06:09:22.548 --> 06:09:22.558 align:start position:0%
those individuals but additionally
 
06:09:24.390 --> 06:09:24.400 align:start position:0%
observations from some of my fellow bail
 
06:09:25.990 --> 06:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
commissioners are and these are quotes
 
06:09:27.670 --> 06:09:27.680 align:start position:0%
from their emails to me
 
06:09:29.350 --> 06:09:29.360 align:start position:0%
if we're not being paid for our services
 
06:09:30.708 --> 06:09:30.718 align:start position:0%
now i don't think they're going to pay
 
06:09:32.548 --> 06:09:32.558 align:start position:0%
us for mileage either
 
06:09:34.548 --> 06:09:34.558 align:start position:0%
that's nice but the bc fee would be
 
06:09:34.558 --> 06:09:35.750 align:start position:0%
that's nice but the bc fee would be
better

06:09:35.750 --> 06:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
better
 
06:09:37.030 --> 06:09:37.040 align:start position:0%
if we can't get the fee from the
 
06:09:38.868 --> 06:09:38.878 align:start position:0%
defendant we certainly won't get mileage
 
06:09:38.878 --> 06:09:40.070 align:start position:0%
defendant we certainly won't get mileage
too

06:09:40.070 --> 06:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
too
 
06:09:41.910 --> 06:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
something else the bc won't be able to
 
06:09:43.670 --> 06:09:43.680 align:start position:0%
collect those are commentaries from
 
06:09:45.510 --> 06:09:45.520 align:start position:0%
other bail commissioners
 
06:09:47.110 --> 06:09:47.120 align:start position:0%
the senate moved ahead and they voted in
 
06:09:49.430 --> 06:09:49.440 align:start position:0%
favor of this bill despite the testimony
 
06:09:51.030 --> 06:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
to the contrary
 
06:09:53.350 --> 06:09:53.360 align:start position:0%
and then in january as i had stated i
 
06:09:55.910 --> 06:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
don't want to appear unappreciative of
 
06:09:57.430 --> 06:09:57.440 align:start position:0%
the fact that someone is trying to look
 
06:10:00.548 --> 06:10:00.558 align:start position:0%
out for our mileage but i would like for
 
06:10:02.470 --> 06:10:02.480 align:start position:0%
the legislative body the state of new
 
06:10:04.788 --> 06:10:04.798 align:start position:0%
hampshire to cure the the real problem
 
06:10:05.750 --> 06:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
which is
 
06:10:07.910 --> 06:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
allowing us to be paid for our services
 
06:10:10.948 --> 06:10:10.958 align:start position:0%
that we provide 24 hours a day seven
 
06:10:13.990 --> 06:10:14.000 align:start position:0%
days a week regardless of weather
 
06:10:14.000 --> 06:10:14.868 align:start position:0%
days a week regardless of weather
um

06:10:14.868 --> 06:10:14.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:10:17.510 --> 06:10:17.520 align:start position:0%
we are the currently the email list that
 
06:10:20.310 --> 06:10:20.320 align:start position:0%
i have which i've had to culminate on my
 
06:10:22.310 --> 06:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
own because the state of new hampshire
 
06:10:24.628 --> 06:10:24.638 align:start position:0%
doesn't afford the bail commissioner's
 
06:10:26.628 --> 06:10:26.638 align:start position:0%
contact information for our fellow bail
 
06:10:26.638 --> 06:10:27.990 align:start position:0%
contact information for our fellow bail
commissioners

06:10:27.990 --> 06:10:28.000 align:start position:0%
commissioners
 
06:10:30.310 --> 06:10:30.320 align:start position:0%
but what i have gained from some of my
 
06:10:31.990 --> 06:10:32.000 align:start position:0%
contacts is that there's about a 60 to
 
06:10:33.830 --> 06:10:33.840 align:start position:0%
65 percent
 
06:10:36.310 --> 06:10:36.320 align:start position:0%
of collection from this community
 
06:10:38.150 --> 06:10:38.160 align:start position:0%
we continue to answer the calls despite
 
06:10:40.548 --> 06:10:40.558 align:start position:0%
the fact that it's 60 to 65 percent and
 
06:10:43.190 --> 06:10:43.200 align:start position:0%
as was just reported the fall off of the
 
06:10:46.470 --> 06:10:46.480 align:start position:0%
population to have lost so many bail
 
06:10:48.708 --> 06:10:48.718 align:start position:0%
commissioners it's really hard to sell
 
06:10:50.628 --> 06:10:50.638 align:start position:0%
this particular
 
06:10:52.310 --> 06:10:52.320 align:start position:0%
gig when you're telling someone you're
 
06:10:54.230 --> 06:10:54.240 align:start position:0%
going to probably collect about 60 to 65
 
06:10:56.070 --> 06:10:56.080 align:start position:0%
percent of the time even though the
 
06:10:58.230 --> 06:10:58.240 align:start position:0%
statute says 100 you know 40 dollars for
 
06:10:59.590 --> 06:10:59.600 align:start position:0%
every single trip
 
06:11:02.230 --> 06:11:02.240 align:start position:0%
but during the 2021 session there was
 
06:11:04.548 --> 06:11:04.558 align:start position:0%
hope with house bill 498 that it would
 
06:11:06.708 --> 06:11:06.718 align:start position:0%
bring bring relief to our community but
 
06:11:09.030 --> 06:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
at the end of the 2021 session the
 
06:11:11.030 --> 06:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
judicial branch attached a fiscal note
 
06:11:13.190 --> 06:11:13.200 align:start position:0%
to that house bill which said that the
 
06:11:16.708 --> 06:11:16.718 align:start position:0%
bill would be in excess of 636 thousand
 
06:11:19.590 --> 06:11:19.600 align:start position:0%
dollars for 2022 and then got climbed to
 
06:11:22.070 --> 06:11:22.080 align:start position:0%
over 850 000
 
06:11:25.510 --> 06:11:25.520 align:start position:0%
for their fiscal note if we add mileage
 
06:11:28.150 --> 06:11:28.160 align:start position:0%
to the bail commissioners presently then
 
06:11:30.390 --> 06:11:30.400 align:start position:0%
that fiscal note
 
06:11:32.390 --> 06:11:32.400 align:start position:0%
is a hurdle that we will never be able
 
06:11:34.150 --> 06:11:34.160 align:start position:0%
to get over because we are a fiscally
 
06:11:35.910 --> 06:11:35.920 align:start position:0%
conservative state
 
06:11:38.310 --> 06:11:38.320 align:start position:0%
so prior to passage of this bill i would
 
06:11:40.390 --> 06:11:40.400 align:start position:0%
ask if the legislative body to please
 
06:11:43.190 --> 06:11:43.200 align:start position:0%
introduce support pass a bill that
 
06:11:45.030 --> 06:11:45.040 align:start position:0%
ensures that our professional community
 
06:11:46.470 --> 06:11:46.480 align:start position:0%
gets paid for the services that we
 
06:11:48.070 --> 06:11:48.080 align:start position:0%
continue to provide
 
06:11:51.430 --> 06:11:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:53.830 --> 06:11:53.840 align:start position:0%
representative testament
 
06:11:55.270 --> 06:11:55.280 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
06:11:55.280 --> 06:11:58.310 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
question

06:11:58.310 --> 06:11:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:00.310 --> 06:12:00.320 align:start position:0%
we seem to be
 
06:12:03.110 --> 06:12:03.120 align:start position:0%
nibbling around the edges
 
06:12:05.350 --> 06:12:05.360 align:start position:0%
on what the real problem is
 
06:12:05.360 --> 06:12:07.110 align:start position:0%
on what the real problem is
uh

06:12:07.110 --> 06:12:07.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:12:09.270 --> 06:12:09.280 align:start position:0%
what do you think of
 
06:12:13.430 --> 06:12:13.440 align:start position:0%
a situation where we had 24-hour
 
06:12:16.868 --> 06:12:16.878 align:start position:0%
seven days a week judges or magistrates
 
06:12:19.670 --> 06:12:19.680 align:start position:0%
we you'd lose a job but we get the job
 
06:12:19.680 --> 06:12:20.788 align:start position:0%
we you'd lose a job but we get the job
done

06:12:20.788 --> 06:12:20.798 align:start position:0%
done
 
06:12:22.788 --> 06:12:22.798 align:start position:0%
by people because you we're you're just
 
06:12:24.548 --> 06:12:24.558 align:start position:0%
a stop gap to the
 
06:12:27.430 --> 06:12:27.440 align:start position:0%
to the judge
 
06:12:27.440 --> 06:12:28.310 align:start position:0%
to the judge
i

06:12:28.310 --> 06:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
i
 
06:12:32.390 --> 06:12:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:32.400 --> 06:12:33.670 align:start position:0%
 
the

06:12:33.670 --> 06:12:33.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:12:36.390 --> 06:12:36.400 align:start position:0%
judiciary um i believe the purpose of
 
06:12:38.230 --> 06:12:38.240 align:start position:0%
the bail commissioner was to be able to
 
06:12:42.150 --> 06:12:42.160 align:start position:0%
relieve the role of judges to not be
 
06:12:43.430 --> 06:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
judges are
 
06:12:45.830 --> 06:12:45.840 align:start position:0%
available for search warrants and other
 
06:12:48.868 --> 06:12:48.878 align:start position:0%
scenarios i mean i have my judge's
 
06:12:48.878 --> 06:12:49.830 align:start position:0%
scenarios i mean i have my judge's
personal

06:12:49.830 --> 06:12:49.840 align:start position:0%
personal
 
06:12:51.990 --> 06:12:52.000 align:start position:0%
email i mean cell phone number in the
 
06:12:53.590 --> 06:12:53.600 align:start position:0%
event that i have a situation that comes
 
06:12:55.830 --> 06:12:55.840 align:start position:0%
up during my on call that i would need
 
06:12:58.548 --> 06:12:58.558 align:start position:0%
to have him assist me with my decision
 
06:13:00.230 --> 06:13:00.240 align:start position:0%
making but
 
06:13:02.070 --> 06:13:02.080 align:start position:0%
to have judges on call you'd probably
 
06:13:03.590 --> 06:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
have to expand
 
06:13:05.030 --> 06:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
the number of judges that you have
 
06:13:07.590 --> 06:13:07.600 align:start position:0%
appointed because 24 hours a day seven
 
06:13:10.310 --> 06:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
days a week 365 days a year that's a lot
 
06:13:11.670 --> 06:13:11.680 align:start position:0%
of judge time
 
06:13:13.270 --> 06:13:13.280 align:start position:0%
and that's a big expense to the state of
 
06:13:14.548 --> 06:13:14.558 align:start position:0%
new hampshire as well because then
 
06:13:15.670 --> 06:13:15.680 align:start position:0%
you're going to have to absorb their
 
06:13:17.910 --> 06:13:17.920 align:start position:0%
salary their retirement all of those
 
06:13:17.920 --> 06:13:19.190 align:start position:0%
salary their retirement all of those
things

06:13:19.190 --> 06:13:19.200 align:start position:0%
things
 
06:13:23.830 --> 06:13:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:25.430 --> 06:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
representative rhodes
 
06:13:27.350 --> 06:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
06:13:29.750 --> 06:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
so my understanding is if you if you
 
06:13:31.990 --> 06:13:32.000 align:start position:0%
answer the phone a bail commissioner has
 
06:13:34.150 --> 06:13:34.160 align:start position:0%
to go right
 
06:13:36.390 --> 06:13:36.400 align:start position:0%
what would it look like
 
06:13:42.390 --> 06:13:42.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:43.270 --> 06:13:43.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:13:45.750 --> 06:13:45.760 align:start position:0%
what was the word i was looking for
 
06:13:48.230 --> 06:13:48.240 align:start position:0%
if the if the if the bill commissioners
 
06:13:49.830 --> 06:13:49.840 align:start position:0%
were to organize themselves over a
 
06:13:51.510 --> 06:13:51.520 align:start position:0%
weekend or whatever it was and say you
 
06:13:52.948 --> 06:13:52.958 align:start position:0%
know what we're not answering the phone
 
06:13:54.788 --> 06:13:54.798 align:start position:0%
what what would the consequence of that
 
06:13:56.470 --> 06:13:56.480 align:start position:0%
look like
 
06:13:56.480 --> 06:13:57.270 align:start position:0%
look like
the

06:13:57.270 --> 06:13:57.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:13:58.948 --> 06:13:58.958 align:start position:0%
pandemonium in the within the police
 
06:14:00.708 --> 06:14:00.718 align:start position:0%
departments absolute pandemonium it
 
06:14:02.070 --> 06:14:02.080 align:start position:0%
would not no i don't think that much
 
06:14:03.110 --> 06:14:03.120 align:start position:0%
would happen
 
06:14:05.510 --> 06:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
in the courts monday through friday
 
06:14:06.948 --> 06:14:06.958 align:start position:0%
on during their work their business
 
06:14:09.190 --> 06:14:09.200 align:start position:0%
hours but your police departments would
 
06:14:11.590 --> 06:14:11.600 align:start position:0%
be overwhelmed the cells would be full i
 
06:14:13.110 --> 06:14:13.120 align:start position:0%
can't imagine that they or they'd be
 
06:14:15.110 --> 06:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
releasing people out to the community
 
06:14:17.030 --> 06:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
that shouldn't be released
 
06:14:18.628 --> 06:14:18.638 align:start position:0%
if they're trying to
 
06:14:20.788 --> 06:14:20.798 align:start position:0%
not fill their cells so it would be it
 
06:14:23.350 --> 06:14:23.360 align:start position:0%
would be chaos utter chaos
 
06:14:25.990 --> 06:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
and we can't organize because as i
 
06:14:27.510 --> 06:14:27.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier
 
06:14:29.750 --> 06:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
we can't get a list of who the bail
 
06:14:32.150 --> 06:14:32.160 align:start position:0%
commissioners are in this here in the
 
06:14:32.160 --> 06:14:33.030 align:start position:0%
commissioners are in this here in the
state

06:14:33.030 --> 06:14:33.040 align:start position:0%
state
 
06:14:42.548 --> 06:14:42.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:45.510 --> 06:14:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:48.390 --> 06:14:48.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and
 
06:14:50.628 --> 06:14:50.638 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
06:14:53.910 --> 06:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
so it i'm trying to understand
 
06:14:55.990 --> 06:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
what your position is i mean currently
 
06:14:58.548 --> 06:14:58.558 align:start position:0%
you don't get the forty dollars
 
06:15:00.788 --> 06:15:00.798 align:start position:0%
and you would then have to calculate
 
06:15:02.548 --> 06:15:02.558 align:start position:0%
what your mileage you expected your
 
06:15:04.390 --> 06:15:04.400 align:start position:0%
mileage to be
 
06:15:06.548 --> 06:15:06.558 align:start position:0%
as you went to the place double that
 
06:15:08.310 --> 06:15:08.320 align:start position:0%
figure out which mileage is and now
 
06:15:10.868 --> 06:15:10.878 align:start position:0%
instead of not getting your
 
06:15:13.590 --> 06:15:13.600 align:start position:0%
forty dollars all we would do by passing
 
06:15:15.830 --> 06:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
this bill would mean that you would not
 
06:15:18.868 --> 06:15:18.878 align:start position:0%
get your hundred dollars or 55 yes sir
 
06:15:22.230 --> 06:15:22.240 align:start position:0%
that's absolutely right thank you
 
06:15:23.590 --> 06:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
and again i just want to point out it
 
06:15:25.270 --> 06:15:25.280 align:start position:0%
would drive up any fiscal note for any
 
06:15:26.830 --> 06:15:26.840 align:start position:0%
potential new
 
06:15:30.708 --> 06:15:30.718 align:start position:0%
legislation representative marston
 
06:15:31.990 --> 06:15:32.000 align:start position:0%

chairman and thank you for taking my
questions

06:15:36.470 --> 06:15:36.480 align:start position:0%

i sometimes ask the wrong questions so
 
06:15:43.030 --> 06:15:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:46.548 --> 06:15:46.558 align:start position:0%
if we you're not in favor of this bill
 
06:15:49.190 --> 06:15:49.200 align:start position:0%
you're in an opposition
 
06:15:51.590 --> 06:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
based on that testimony
 
06:15:54.470 --> 06:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
if some of us were to decide to itl this
 
06:15:56.708 --> 06:15:56.718 align:start position:0%
bill that would not offend you
 
06:15:59.110 --> 06:15:59.120 align:start position:0%
i would not be offended and i apologize
 
06:16:00.628 --> 06:16:00.638 align:start position:0%
to any other bail commissioners which
 
06:16:02.788 --> 06:16:02.798 align:start position:0%
are there are very few right that would
 
06:16:05.030 --> 06:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
be offended um because we would really
 
06:16:07.830 --> 06:16:07.840 align:start position:0%
like the focus to be on as i've stated
 
06:16:09.670 --> 06:16:09.680 align:start position:0%
and i agree with that and thank you for
 
06:16:14.470 --> 06:16:14.480 align:start position:0%

06:18:07.190 --> 06:18:07.200 align:start position:0%
i honestly
 
06:18:09.510 --> 06:18:09.520 align:start position:0%
you know the pay was not an issue having
 
06:18:10.470 --> 06:18:10.480 align:start position:0%
said that
 
06:18:13.110 --> 06:18:13.120 align:start position:0%
i didn't expect to work for free
 
06:18:13.120 --> 06:18:14.070 align:start position:0%
i didn't expect to work for free
currently

06:18:14.070 --> 06:18:14.080 align:start position:0%
currently
 
06:18:16.470 --> 06:18:16.480 align:start position:0%
after three years my average is between
 
06:18:19.910 --> 06:18:19.920 align:start position:0%
60 and 70 percent getting paid
 
06:18:22.230 --> 06:18:22.240 align:start position:0%
um last year i
 
06:18:25.110 --> 06:18:25.120 align:start position:0%
clocked in approximately 4 000 miles
 
06:18:25.120 --> 06:18:26.310 align:start position:0%
clocked in approximately 4 000 miles
um

06:18:26.310 --> 06:18:26.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:18:26.320 --> 06:18:27.190 align:start position:0%
um
i'm

06:18:27.190 --> 06:18:27.200 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
06:18:29.510 --> 06:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
testifying in opposition to this bill
 
06:18:30.788 --> 06:18:30.798 align:start position:0%
for most of the reasons that we're
 
06:18:32.628 --> 06:18:32.638 align:start position:0%
already stated
 
06:18:34.150 --> 06:18:34.160 align:start position:0%
you know mileage is not the issue
 
06:18:37.190 --> 06:18:37.200 align:start position:0%
getting paid our 40 fees is the issue
 
06:18:38.628 --> 06:18:38.638 align:start position:0%
um the
 
06:18:40.948 --> 06:18:40.958 align:start position:0%
representative over here asked about um
 
06:18:42.708 --> 06:18:42.718 align:start position:0%
you know seeing multiple
 
06:18:45.670 --> 06:18:45.680 align:start position:0%
defendants in manchester i have no idea
 
06:18:47.350 --> 06:18:47.360 align:start position:0%
how many people i'm gonna see anytime i
 
06:18:49.750 --> 06:18:49.760 align:start position:0%
get a call it starts with one and i end
 
06:18:51.590 --> 06:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
up with five or six
 
06:18:51.600 --> 06:18:52.470 align:start position:0%
up with five or six
um

06:18:52.470 --> 06:18:52.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:18:55.510 --> 06:18:55.520 align:start position:0%
how to uh charge you know each of these
 
06:18:57.270 --> 06:18:57.280 align:start position:0%
defendants you know when i'm not when i
 
06:18:58.948 --> 06:18:58.958 align:start position:0%
don't know who i'm gonna see
 
06:19:02.150 --> 06:19:02.160 align:start position:0%
um i see actually is a penalty um
 
06:19:04.150 --> 06:19:04.160 align:start position:0%
you know if i charge one you know the
 
06:19:06.310 --> 06:19:06.320 align:start position:0%
entire amount and and no one else
 
06:19:08.708 --> 06:19:08.718 align:start position:0%
you know i don't think that's fair um
 
06:19:11.110 --> 06:19:11.120 align:start position:0%
but again you know as uh most the other
 
06:19:13.430 --> 06:19:13.440 align:start position:0%
bail commissioners stated the 40 fee is
 
06:19:16.390 --> 06:19:16.400 align:start position:0%
is the issue not mileage um and
 
06:19:18.470 --> 06:19:18.480 align:start position:0%
representative abbas um i'm not an
 
06:19:20.470 --> 06:19:20.480 align:start position:0%
accountant but i'm married to one
 
06:19:20.480 --> 06:19:21.590 align:start position:0%
accountant but i'm married to one
um

06:19:21.590 --> 06:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:19:24.708 --> 06:19:24.718 align:start position:0%
so for mileage and expenses um is you
 
06:19:27.430 --> 06:19:27.440 align:start position:0%
know if you itemize your taxes uh it's a
 
06:19:27.440 --> 06:19:28.548 align:start position:0%
know if you itemize your taxes uh it's a
deduction

06:19:28.548 --> 06:19:28.558 align:start position:0%
deduction
 
06:19:32.070 --> 06:19:32.080 align:start position:0%
um it will it will not equal um mileage
 
06:19:33.510 --> 06:19:33.520 align:start position:0%
for instance that if we did get paid
 
06:19:35.590 --> 06:19:35.600 align:start position:0%
through this bill it will be less but at
 
06:19:37.910 --> 06:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
least it's something so we can claim you
 
06:19:40.390 --> 06:19:40.400 align:start position:0%
know mileage office supplies you know
 
06:19:42.150 --> 06:19:42.160 align:start position:0%
envelopes stamps you know things of that
 
06:19:42.160 --> 06:19:43.910 align:start position:0%
envelopes stamps you know things of that
nature

06:19:43.910 --> 06:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
nature
 
06:19:45.030 --> 06:19:45.040 align:start position:0%
and thank you for your testimony my
 
06:19:47.670 --> 06:19:47.680 align:start position:0%
concern was that if this were to become
 
06:19:49.110 --> 06:19:49.120 align:start position:0%
law that you would not be able to
 
06:19:51.590 --> 06:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
itemize that anymore in future tax
 
06:19:53.430 --> 06:19:53.440 align:start position:0%
filings that is correct and i'm not sure
 
06:19:54.708 --> 06:19:54.718 align:start position:0%
which one's more equitable that's why i
 
06:19:56.310 --> 06:19:56.320 align:start position:0%
was when i was getting that but i think
 
06:19:58.310 --> 06:19:58.320 align:start position:0%
i think the mileage in this bill would
 
06:20:00.390 --> 06:20:00.400 align:start position:0%
actually pay us more however
 
06:20:03.430 --> 06:20:03.440 align:start position:0%
again you know with with the pay rate
 
06:20:05.750 --> 06:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
it may it may balance out i don't know
 
06:20:07.270 --> 06:20:07.280 align:start position:0%
um you know because again if we're only
 
06:20:09.670 --> 06:20:09.680 align:start position:0%
getting paid 60 to 70 of the time and
 
06:20:12.070 --> 06:20:12.080 align:start position:0%
not collecting those mileage fees uh it
 
06:20:13.910 --> 06:20:13.920 align:start position:0%
may be more beneficial to to claim it on
 
06:20:16.628 --> 06:20:16.638 align:start position:0%
our taxes as an expense
 
06:20:17.990 --> 06:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
would it be possible that you might
 
06:20:19.670 --> 06:20:19.680 align:start position:0%
actually get paid less
 
06:20:19.680 --> 06:20:21.430 align:start position:0%
actually get paid less
potentially

06:20:21.430 --> 06:20:21.440 align:start position:0%
potentially
 
06:20:24.230 --> 06:20:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:26.470 --> 06:20:26.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:20:26.480 --> 06:20:29.030 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

06:20:29.030 --> 06:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:30.868 --> 06:20:30.878 align:start position:0%
i have no further comments again most of
 
06:20:30.878 --> 06:20:31.990 align:start position:0%
i have no further comments again most of
the

06:20:31.990 --> 06:20:32.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:20:33.750 --> 06:20:33.760 align:start position:0%
other bail commissioners already covered
 
06:20:36.310 --> 06:20:36.320 align:start position:0%
what uh i wanted to cover so thank you
 
06:20:39.350 --> 06:20:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:40.628 --> 06:20:40.638 align:start position:0%
seeing no hands raised i want to thank
 
06:20:44.868 --> 06:20:44.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:46.230 --> 06:20:46.240 align:start position:0%
are there any members of the public
 
06:20:47.670 --> 06:20:47.680 align:start position:0%
present who wish to testify that have
 
06:20:50.628 --> 06:20:50.638 align:start position:0%
not testified already
 
06:20:52.868 --> 06:20:52.878 align:start position:0%
seeing no hands raised we will now close
 
06:20:58.070 --> 06:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:58.080 --> 06:21:09.190 align:start position:0%
 
361.

06:21:09.190 --> 06:21:09.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:10.150 --> 06:21:10.160 align:start position:0%
just to the members of the community
 
06:21:12.628 --> 06:21:12.638 align:start position:0%
we're going to do several exec executive
 
06:21:14.470 --> 06:21:14.480 align:start position:0%
sessions in a row now
 
06:21:16.788 --> 06:21:16.798 align:start position:0%
some of these are early deadline bills
 
06:21:20.070 --> 06:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
the deadline is thursday the the 14th
 
06:21:22.868 --> 06:21:22.878 align:start position:0%
they were they were assigned on friday
 
06:21:24.390 --> 06:21:24.400 align:start position:0%
actually representative speaker we spoke
 
06:21:25.910 --> 06:21:25.920 align:start position:0%
that morning i gave you the list of
 
06:21:28.390 --> 06:21:28.400 align:start position:0%
bills and then
 
06:21:30.230 --> 06:21:30.240 align:start position:0%
by that afternoon that list changed i
 
06:21:33.990 --> 06:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
hope you didn't call me a liar because
 
06:21:35.590 --> 06:21:35.600 align:start position:0%
but but we
 
06:21:37.990 --> 06:21:38.000 align:start position:0%
we let's get them all done okay
 
06:21:40.390 --> 06:21:40.400 align:start position:0%
so at this time
 
06:21:42.150 --> 06:21:42.160 align:start position:0%
at this time when i opened the executive
 
06:21:46.628 --> 06:21:46.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:48.788 --> 06:21:48.798 align:start position:0%
instead establishing a law enforcement
 
06:21:50.788 --> 06:21:50.798 align:start position:0%
conduct review committee
 
06:21:52.070 --> 06:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
in the police standards and training
 
06:21:53.670 --> 06:21:53.680 align:start position:0%
council on making an appropriation
 
06:21:53.680 --> 06:21:56.470 align:start position:0%
council on making an appropriation
therefore

06:21:56.470 --> 06:21:56.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:57.910 --> 06:21:57.920 align:start position:0%
at this time the chair recognizes
 
06:22:01.190 --> 06:22:01.200 align:start position:0%
representative welch to make a motion
 
06:22:04.150 --> 06:22:04.160 align:start position:0%
i move the senate bill 456 be referred
 
06:22:06.868 --> 06:22:06.878 align:start position:0%
for interim study
 
06:22:08.150 --> 06:22:08.160 align:start position:0%
is there a second the second by
 
06:22:10.708 --> 06:22:10.718 align:start position:0%
representative boarding
 
06:22:12.788 --> 06:22:12.798 align:start position:0%
and the reason i say that is because
 
06:22:17.670 --> 06:22:17.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:19.110 --> 06:22:19.120 align:start position:0%
it doesn't make sense to have the
 
06:22:21.190 --> 06:22:21.200 align:start position:0%
finance committee convene another
 
06:22:21.200 --> 06:22:22.310 align:start position:0%
finance committee convene another
session

06:22:22.310 --> 06:22:22.320 align:start position:0%
session
 
06:22:25.030 --> 06:22:25.040 align:start position:0%
to do what they've already done
 
06:22:27.110 --> 06:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
and i just think it makes sense
 
06:22:31.910 --> 06:22:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:33.750 --> 06:22:33.760 align:start position:0%
very well said
 
06:22:36.548 --> 06:22:36.558 align:start position:0%
anyways anyone else wish to speak
 
06:22:39.590 --> 06:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
representative ray newman
 
06:22:41.590 --> 06:22:41.600 align:start position:0%
i just have a parliamentary inquiry what
 
06:22:43.990 --> 06:22:44.000 align:start position:0%
so if we kill the senate bill then they
 
06:22:45.910 --> 06:22:45.920 align:start position:0%
kill the bill over there
 
06:22:47.510 --> 06:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
there's just something else in it that's
 
06:22:47.520 --> 06:22:48.310 align:start position:0%
there's just something else in it that's
god

06:22:48.310 --> 06:22:48.320 align:start position:0%
god
 
06:22:49.750 --> 06:22:49.760 align:start position:0%
when you say the term kill i believe
 
06:22:51.670 --> 06:22:51.680 align:start position:0%
your kill i mean if we in extreme
 
06:22:51.680 --> 06:22:52.788 align:start position:0%
your kill i mean if we in extreme
legislation

06:22:52.788 --> 06:22:52.798 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
06:22:55.270 --> 06:22:55.280 align:start position:0%
right inexpedient to legislate
 
06:22:57.190 --> 06:22:57.200 align:start position:0%
is it possible that that would happen in
 
06:22:59.110 --> 06:22:59.120 align:start position:0%
the senate and then you don't have this
 
06:22:59.120 --> 06:23:00.948 align:start position:0%
the senate and then you don't have this
or

06:23:00.948 --> 06:23:00.958 align:start position:0%
or
 
06:23:00.958 --> 06:23:01.910 align:start position:0%
or
is

06:23:01.910 --> 06:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
is
 
06:23:03.910 --> 06:23:03.920 align:start position:0%
that's my problem don't worry i don't i
 
06:23:06.708 --> 06:23:06.718 align:start position:0%
don't want to say it's impossible i
 
06:23:07.830 --> 06:23:07.840 align:start position:0%
i don't want to
 
06:23:09.670 --> 06:23:09.680 align:start position:0%
i've been in some communication with
 
06:23:12.150 --> 06:23:12.160 align:start position:0%
some members of the other body and
 
06:23:13.670 --> 06:23:13.680 align:start position:0%
explained to him what
 
06:23:15.430 --> 06:23:15.440 align:start position:0%
we intended on doing
 
06:23:17.830 --> 06:23:17.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr with this one so
 
06:23:22.830 --> 06:23:22.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:25.110 --> 06:23:25.120 align:start position:0%
representative yes i'd like to add one
 
06:23:27.590 --> 06:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
thing just to kind of clear this up
 
06:23:29.990 --> 06:23:30.000 align:start position:0%
when we had the commission where we
 
06:23:30.000 --> 06:23:30.868 align:start position:0%
when we had the commission where we
uh

06:23:30.868 --> 06:23:30.878 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:23:33.030 --> 06:23:33.040 align:start position:0%
basically came up with this bill
 
06:23:35.910 --> 06:23:35.920 align:start position:0%
i asked senator carson who was the only
 
06:23:38.708 --> 06:23:38.718 align:start position:0%
other legislative member of that
 
06:23:38.718 --> 06:23:39.910 align:start position:0%
other legislative member of that
committee

06:23:39.910 --> 06:23:39.920 align:start position:0%
committee
 
06:23:41.510 --> 06:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
if she was going to do it and she said
 
06:23:41.520 --> 06:23:42.708 align:start position:0%
if she was going to do it and she said
no

06:23:42.708 --> 06:23:42.718 align:start position:0%
no
 
06:23:45.910 --> 06:23:45.920 align:start position:0%
i said well then i'll do it
 
06:23:48.150 --> 06:23:48.160 align:start position:0%
i figure at this point
 
06:23:49.750 --> 06:23:49.760 align:start position:0%
she didn't want to do it she doesn't
 
06:23:49.760 --> 06:23:50.830 align:start position:0%
she didn't want to do it she doesn't
have

06:23:50.830 --> 06:23:50.840 align:start position:0%
have
 
06:23:55.350 --> 06:23:55.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:00.470 --> 06:24:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:00.480 --> 06:24:02.708 align:start position:0%
 
representative

06:24:02.708 --> 06:24:02.718 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:24:07.510 --> 06:24:07.520 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i i want to note that
 
06:24:09.190 --> 06:24:09.200 align:start position:0%
the motion is
 
06:24:12.390 --> 06:24:12.400 align:start position:0%
inter study which means that if the
 
06:24:15.590 --> 06:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
senate were to kill the house of bill
 
06:24:19.110 --> 06:24:19.120 align:start position:0%
we could probably reintroduce
 
06:24:22.470 --> 06:24:22.480 align:start position:0%
this back to the house floor
 
06:24:25.270 --> 06:24:25.280 align:start position:0%
and just for a point of clarification i
 
06:24:26.628 --> 06:24:26.638 align:start position:0%
would not want to put this on the
 
06:24:28.390 --> 06:24:28.400 align:start position:0%
consent count the reason why is that i
 
06:24:30.868 --> 06:24:30.878 align:start position:0%
would likely move to table
 
06:24:30.878 --> 06:24:31.750 align:start position:0%
would likely move to table
this

06:24:31.750 --> 06:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:24:31.760 --> 06:24:32.548 align:start position:0%
this
bill

06:24:32.548 --> 06:24:32.558 align:start position:0%
bill
 
06:24:34.150 --> 06:24:34.160 align:start position:0%
it's on the consent calendar it gets a
 
06:24:37.030 --> 06:24:37.040 align:start position:0%
little so please don't
 
06:24:38.230 --> 06:24:38.240 align:start position:0%
we don't need to have someone
 
06:24:39.670 --> 06:24:39.680 align:start position:0%
necessarily again we just won't put it
 
06:24:41.350 --> 06:24:41.360 align:start position:0%
on and then
 
06:24:42.788 --> 06:24:42.798 align:start position:0%
if for some reason i'm not there someone
 
06:24:44.310 --> 06:24:44.320 align:start position:0%
do that in my honor but we'll do that
 
06:24:46.070 --> 06:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
and we can always if things go fall we
 
06:24:47.430 --> 06:24:47.440 align:start position:0%
can then take it off the table and go
 
06:24:49.990 --> 06:24:50.000 align:start position:0%
that route okay
 
06:24:51.590 --> 06:24:51.600 align:start position:0%

yes

and then seconded by representative
 
06:27:03.270 --> 06:27:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:04.708 --> 06:27:04.718 align:start position:0%
represented bertie wish to speak to your
 
06:27:10.788 --> 06:27:10.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:12.150 --> 06:27:12.160 align:start position:0%
i believe
 
06:27:16.070 --> 06:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
senate bill 376 is very needed
 
06:27:18.868 --> 06:27:18.878 align:start position:0%
and the reason is
 
06:27:22.948 --> 06:27:22.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:24.708 --> 06:27:24.718 align:start position:0%
senator guida said
 
06:27:26.548 --> 06:27:26.558 align:start position:0%
is very narrow
 
06:27:29.990 --> 06:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
guided on what he can do which is is it
 
06:27:30.000 --> 06:27:31.430 align:start position:0%
guided on what he can do which is is it
justified

06:27:31.430 --> 06:27:31.440 align:start position:0%
justified
 
06:27:33.590 --> 06:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
a police shooting or was it not
 
06:27:38.390 --> 06:27:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:41.670 --> 06:27:41.680 align:start position:0%
i personally uh
 
06:27:44.230 --> 06:27:44.240 align:start position:0%
have seen two cases myself in new
 
06:27:45.830 --> 06:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire where
 
06:27:48.230 --> 06:27:48.240 align:start position:0%
i think other alternatives could have
 
06:27:51.030 --> 06:27:51.040 align:start position:0%
happened even though the a.g in one of
 
06:27:53.110 --> 06:27:53.120 align:start position:0%
the cases said that it was justified the
 
06:27:56.230 --> 06:27:56.240 align:start position:0%
other case he said we don't know
 
06:27:56.240 --> 06:27:58.230 align:start position:0%
other case he said we don't know
um

06:27:58.230 --> 06:27:58.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:27:59.190 --> 06:27:59.200 align:start position:0%
that they're
 
06:28:03.350 --> 06:28:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:06.708 --> 06:28:06.718 align:start position:0%
could come to learn and learn from and
 
06:28:09.270 --> 06:28:09.280 align:start position:0%
to teach the the law enforcement that
 
06:28:11.590 --> 06:28:11.600 align:start position:0%
there are other alternatives if that's
 
06:28:13.270 --> 06:28:13.280 align:start position:0%
the case after reviewing those
 
06:28:13.280 --> 06:28:14.628 align:start position:0%
the case after reviewing those
situations

06:28:14.628 --> 06:28:14.638 align:start position:0%
situations
 
06:28:16.390 --> 06:28:16.400 align:start position:0%
so that's why i support this i think
 
06:28:19.190 --> 06:28:19.200 align:start position:0%
it's very needed and i very much welcome
 
06:28:25.190 --> 06:28:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:27.990 --> 06:28:28.000 align:start position:0%
representative espio
 
06:28:30.708 --> 06:28:30.718 align:start position:0%
i think it's chair um i agree with her
 
06:28:32.948 --> 06:28:32.958 align:start position:0%
with my colleague from goffstown i think
 
06:28:34.708 --> 06:28:34.718 align:start position:0%
this is definitely something that's
 
06:28:34.718 --> 06:28:36.468 align:start position:0%
this is definitely something that's
needed

06:28:36.468 --> 06:28:36.478 align:start position:0%
needed
 
06:28:38.708 --> 06:28:38.718 align:start position:0%
and you know i know that law enforcement
 
06:28:40.788 --> 06:28:40.798 align:start position:0%
has a difficult job and just making sure
 
06:28:42.788 --> 06:28:42.798 align:start position:0%
we can find ways to help them and
 
06:28:45.030 --> 06:28:45.040 align:start position:0%
provide some accountability is important
 
06:28:47.270 --> 06:28:47.280 align:start position:0%
i i roast my head because i also you
 
06:28:49.910 --> 06:28:49.920 align:start position:0%
know i know that senator guida had
 
06:28:53.430 --> 06:28:53.440 align:start position:0%
proposed an amendment on this bill um
 
06:28:55.750 --> 06:28:55.760 align:start position:0%
he's that he passed out about
 
06:28:58.310 --> 06:28:58.320 align:start position:0%
having a program administrator
 
06:28:58.320 --> 06:28:59.910 align:start position:0%
having a program administrator
um

06:28:59.910 --> 06:28:59.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:29:03.990 --> 06:29:04.000 align:start position:0%
that would help kind of guide the
 
06:29:05.350 --> 06:29:05.360 align:start position:0%
you know help
 
06:29:07.350 --> 06:29:07.360 align:start position:0%
help guide us along and make sure that
 
06:29:08.548 --> 06:29:08.558 align:start position:0%
you know if they needed any help that
 
06:29:10.070 --> 06:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
they would be a staff person to help
 
06:29:11.270 --> 06:29:11.280 align:start position:0%
them through that
 
06:29:14.390 --> 06:29:14.400 align:start position:0%
um do we want to consider this some this
 
06:29:16.310 --> 06:29:16.320 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment i mean we'd have to
 
06:29:22.868 --> 06:29:22.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:25.030 --> 06:29:25.040 align:start position:0%
my understanding was the the amendment
 
06:29:26.628 --> 06:29:26.638 align:start position:0%
but it's not an
 
06:29:29.030 --> 06:29:29.040 align:start position:0%
amendment but the suggested language was
 
06:29:30.868 --> 06:29:30.878 align:start position:0%
just adding and one under that
 
06:29:32.708 --> 06:29:32.718 align:start position:0%
underlying section for facilitation
 
06:29:34.708 --> 06:29:34.718 align:start position:0%
instruction of additional training
 
06:29:37.670 --> 06:29:37.680 align:start position:0%
sessions yeah so if i
 
06:29:37.680 --> 06:29:39.270 align:start position:0%
sessions yeah so if i
oh

06:29:39.270 --> 06:29:39.280 align:start position:0%
oh
 
06:29:40.548 --> 06:29:40.558 align:start position:0%
so he said
 
06:29:42.708 --> 06:29:42.718 align:start position:0%
so yes and then he gave us another one
 
06:29:47.430 --> 06:29:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:49.350 --> 06:29:49.360 align:start position:0%
so there's two of them yeah so there's
 
06:29:51.030 --> 06:29:51.040 align:start position:0%
so yeah there's the one that holly
 
06:29:52.468 --> 06:29:52.478 align:start position:0%
originally gave us and then there was
 
06:29:53.910 --> 06:29:53.920 align:start position:0%
another one that the center gave us in
 
06:30:22.628 --> 06:30:22.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:24.230 --> 06:30:24.240 align:start position:0%
for your point of order please please
 
06:30:26.150 --> 06:30:26.160 align:start position:0%
state your point of order
 
06:30:28.468 --> 06:30:28.478 align:start position:0%
uh amendment has been talked about but i
 
06:30:30.868 --> 06:30:30.878 align:start position:0%
don't see it nor does it have a number
 
06:30:40.868 --> 06:30:40.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:42.788 --> 06:30:42.798 align:start position:0%
i have to rule on the point
 
06:30:45.910 --> 06:30:45.920 align:start position:0%
you what you're saying is is correct uh
 
06:30:47.190 --> 06:30:47.200 align:start position:0%
there is no
 
06:30:48.788 --> 06:30:48.798 align:start position:0%
drafted amendment
 
06:30:51.350 --> 06:30:51.360 align:start position:0%
before the committee at this time
 
06:30:53.430 --> 06:30:53.440 align:start position:0%
uh i believe the representative from
 
06:30:53.440 --> 06:30:55.590 align:start position:0%
uh i believe the representative from
nashua

06:30:55.590 --> 06:30:55.600 align:start position:0%
nashua
 
06:30:55.600 --> 06:30:57.030 align:start position:0%
nashua
well

06:30:57.030 --> 06:30:57.040 align:start position:0%
well
 
06:31:01.350 --> 06:31:01.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:04.150 --> 06:31:04.160 align:start position:0%
was mentioning just
 
06:31:06.150 --> 06:31:06.160 align:start position:0%
bringing to our attention i think the
 
06:31:07.990 --> 06:31:08.000 align:start position:0%
chair was not in the was not present
 
06:31:10.310 --> 06:31:10.320 align:start position:0%
when the senator was discussing this i
 
06:31:12.230 --> 06:31:12.240 align:start position:0%
assumed he was just
 
06:31:14.230 --> 06:31:14.240 align:start position:0%
bringing it up to me not trying to be
 
06:31:16.390 --> 06:31:16.400 align:start position:0%
out of order so i i would
 
06:31:20.070 --> 06:31:20.080 align:start position:0%
with that being said if
 
06:31:21.350 --> 06:31:21.360 align:start position:0%
it's the will of the committee to not
 
06:31:23.270 --> 06:31:23.280 align:start position:0%
pass it because
 
06:31:25.510 --> 06:31:25.520 align:start position:0%
if we're not gonna if you want this um
 
06:31:27.190 --> 06:31:27.200 align:start position:0%
what this language is to be an amendment
 
06:31:28.468 --> 06:31:28.478 align:start position:0%
i would suppose
 
06:31:30.070 --> 06:31:30.080 align:start position:0%
you oppose the author pass and we'll see
 
06:31:31.430 --> 06:31:31.440 align:start position:0%
where we're at
 
06:31:31.440 --> 06:31:32.628 align:start position:0%
where we're at
um

06:31:32.628 --> 06:31:32.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:31:34.708 --> 06:31:34.718 align:start position:0%
creating a new position i i don't i
 
06:31:36.548 --> 06:31:36.558 align:start position:0%
don't know what the new position is i
 
06:31:39.270 --> 06:31:39.280 align:start position:0%
wouldn't know where to begin with that
 
06:31:42.548 --> 06:31:42.558 align:start position:0%
i've never heard
 
06:31:44.230 --> 06:31:44.240 align:start position:0%
an amendment boy
 
06:31:51.670 --> 06:31:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:53.350 --> 06:31:53.360 align:start position:0%
it would have to be prepared i think
 
06:31:54.628 --> 06:31:54.638 align:start position:0%
what what the
 
06:31:56.230 --> 06:31:56.240 align:start position:0%
the understanding was if we would want
 
06:31:57.750 --> 06:31:57.760 align:start position:0%
to consent to consider that we would
 
06:31:57.760 --> 06:31:58.548 align:start position:0%
to consent to consider that we would
need

06:31:58.548 --> 06:31:58.558 align:start position:0%
need
 
06:32:01.670 --> 06:32:01.680 align:start position:0%
to to do that if we vote ought to pass
 
06:32:04.788 --> 06:32:04.798 align:start position:0%
uh i i will also say this we are on a
 
06:32:07.750 --> 06:32:07.760 align:start position:0%
extremely tight deadline
 
06:32:09.590 --> 06:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
if for some reason
 
06:32:11.830 --> 06:32:11.840 align:start position:0%
someone were to prepare if we were to
 
06:32:14.708 --> 06:32:14.718 align:start position:0%
pass this and there were to be
 
06:32:16.628 --> 06:32:16.638 align:start position:0%
an amendment drafted we always can move
 
06:32:18.468 --> 06:32:18.478 align:start position:0%
for reconsideration provide the bill is
 
06:32:20.310 --> 06:32:20.320 align:start position:0%
still in the committee
 
06:32:23.350 --> 06:32:23.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:35.510 --> 06:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:36.628 --> 06:32:36.638 align:start position:0%
i would say that again but turn your
 
06:32:39.750 --> 06:32:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:45.670 --> 06:32:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:48.390 --> 06:32:48.400 align:start position:0%
representative thank you uh if i
 
06:32:50.150 --> 06:32:50.160 align:start position:0%
understood right
 
06:32:52.948 --> 06:32:52.958 align:start position:0%
the bill as is will work
 
06:32:54.708 --> 06:32:54.718 align:start position:0%
it's just something that they wanted to
 
06:32:56.390 --> 06:32:56.400 align:start position:0%
add if i
 
06:33:00.230 --> 06:33:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:01.670 --> 06:33:01.680 align:start position:0%
but you know bottom line the committee
 
06:33:03.750 --> 06:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
can uh the senate or the other body can
 
06:33:05.110 --> 06:33:05.120 align:start position:0%
request a committee of conference and
 
06:33:08.548 --> 06:33:08.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:10.868 --> 06:33:10.878 align:start position:0%
is a chance at this late stage
 
06:33:15.510 --> 06:33:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:19.270 --> 06:33:19.280 align:start position:0%
representative marston yeah
 
06:33:21.990 --> 06:33:22.000 align:start position:0%
an inquiry of the chair could we not
 
06:33:28.310 --> 06:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:31.350 --> 06:33:31.360 align:start position:0%
there's no rule saying you can't do one
 
06:33:34.230 --> 06:33:34.240 align:start position:0%
thank you that's all i wanted to know
 
06:33:35.750 --> 06:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
there are some procedural restrictions
 
06:33:40.868 --> 06:33:40.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:43.190 --> 06:33:43.200 align:start position:0%
representative harry gathered um the
 
06:33:45.110 --> 06:33:45.120 align:start position:0%
bill also says this act shall take
 
06:33:47.110 --> 06:33:47.120 align:start position:0%
effect upon this passage
 
06:33:50.150 --> 06:33:50.160 align:start position:0%
but on the amendment it says um june
 
06:33:52.628 --> 06:33:52.638 align:start position:0%
30th 2023.
 
06:34:05.910 --> 06:34:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:09.270 --> 06:34:09.280 align:start position:0%
so if the committee really wants to have
 
06:34:11.750 --> 06:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
to consider a mimic can we withdraw the
 
06:34:15.030 --> 06:34:15.040 align:start position:0%
motion to ought to pass and have it
 
06:34:16.150 --> 06:34:16.160 align:start position:0%
brought up
 
06:34:19.510 --> 06:34:19.520 align:start position:0%
on the next wednesday for the next
 
06:34:19.520 --> 06:34:21.430 align:start position:0%
on the next wednesday for the next
session

06:34:21.430 --> 06:34:21.440 align:start position:0%
session
 
06:34:23.510 --> 06:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
i will tell you this my recommendations
 
06:34:25.510 --> 06:34:25.520 align:start position:0%
is just i'm one person which
 
06:34:27.990 --> 06:34:28.000 align:start position:0%
quite often is not followed
 
06:34:30.628 --> 06:34:30.638 align:start position:0%
is if we were to vote on the ought to
 
06:34:33.830 --> 06:34:33.840 align:start position:0%
pass even if we were unanimous on
 
06:34:35.750 --> 06:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
if provided the bill is still in the
 
06:34:37.430 --> 06:34:37.440 align:start position:0%
committee which means
 
06:34:38.468 --> 06:34:38.478 align:start position:0%
i don't
 
06:34:41.190 --> 06:34:41.200 align:start position:0%
we haven't turned it
 
06:34:42.708 --> 06:34:42.718 align:start position:0%
we haven't turned it into the clerk of
 
06:34:43.830 --> 06:34:43.840 align:start position:0%
the house once it's delivered to the
 
06:34:45.590 --> 06:34:45.600 align:start position:0%
clerk it's out of the committee
 
06:34:47.990 --> 06:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
we could consider
 
06:34:48.000 --> 06:34:49.510 align:start position:0%
we could consider
reconsideration

06:34:49.510 --> 06:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
reconsideration
 
06:34:52.070 --> 06:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
on wednesday our deadline
 
06:34:54.708 --> 06:34:54.718 align:start position:0%
is thursday the 14th
 
06:34:54.718 --> 06:34:55.590 align:start position:0%
is thursday the 14th
so

06:34:55.590 --> 06:34:55.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:34:59.830 --> 06:34:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:59.840 --> 06:35:00.628 align:start position:0%
 
we

06:35:00.628 --> 06:35:00.638 align:start position:0%
we
 
06:35:02.708 --> 06:35:02.718 align:start position:0%
pass the bill if someone really feels
 
06:35:04.868 --> 06:35:04.878 align:start position:0%
strongly about
 
06:35:06.310 --> 06:35:06.320 align:start position:0%
the the
 
06:35:08.390 --> 06:35:08.400 align:start position:0%
a proposed amendment down the line and
 
06:35:11.910 --> 06:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
they were to have it together and i
 
06:35:14.390 --> 06:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
get over overwhelmed by the large number
 
06:35:15.750 --> 06:35:15.760 align:start position:0%
of members of the committee i would
 
06:35:15.760 --> 06:35:16.868 align:start position:0%
of members of the committee i would
consider

06:35:16.868 --> 06:35:16.878 align:start position:0%
consider
 
06:35:19.670 --> 06:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
reopening the executive session to
 
06:35:21.670 --> 06:35:21.680 align:start position:0%
reconsider it to then we can go from
 
06:35:23.350 --> 06:35:23.360 align:start position:0%
that route or the senator could go to
 
06:35:25.270 --> 06:35:25.280 align:start position:0%
ols and get it himself
 
06:35:28.948 --> 06:35:28.958 align:start position:0%
or if or perhaps as the our friend from
 
06:35:32.150 --> 06:35:32.160 align:start position:0%
portsmouth recommended that it can be
 
06:35:33.510 --> 06:35:33.520 align:start position:0%
done by a member of the other body as
 
06:35:33.520 --> 06:35:36.070 align:start position:0%
done by a member of the other body as
well

06:35:36.070 --> 06:35:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:38.070 --> 06:35:38.080 align:start position:0%
there is a problem with the
 
06:35:40.948 --> 06:35:40.958 align:start position:0%
other body drafting a amendment since
 
06:35:43.990 --> 06:35:44.000 align:start position:0%
it's already passed the senate as
 
06:35:47.190 --> 06:35:47.200 align:start position:0%
written and it comes to us as
 
06:35:50.070 --> 06:35:50.080 align:start position:0%
and we pass it as a they amended it
 
06:35:53.030 --> 06:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
there is no need for anything
 
06:35:56.070 --> 06:35:56.080 align:start position:0%
that the senate can do because there is
 
06:35:57.990 --> 06:35:58.000 align:start position:0%
it's because we've already concurred
 
06:36:01.190 --> 06:36:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:02.708 --> 06:36:02.718 align:start position:0%
i i don't know if that's entirely
 
06:36:02.718 --> 06:36:04.708 align:start position:0%
i i don't know if that's entirely
accurate

06:36:04.708 --> 06:36:04.718 align:start position:0%
accurate
 
06:36:04.718 --> 06:36:08.708 align:start position:0%
accurate
but

06:36:08.708 --> 06:36:08.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:10.548 --> 06:36:10.558 align:start position:0%
the they can
 
06:36:11.830 --> 06:36:11.840 align:start position:0%
the house
 
06:36:14.468 --> 06:36:14.478 align:start position:0%
can approve an amendment separate from
 
06:36:16.948 --> 06:36:16.958 align:start position:0%
what the other body has done
 
06:36:18.628 --> 06:36:18.638 align:start position:0%
right all right
 
06:36:18.638 --> 06:36:19.830 align:start position:0%
right all right
it

06:36:19.830 --> 06:36:19.840 align:start position:0%
it
 
06:36:22.948 --> 06:36:22.958 align:start position:0%
a senator excuse me for saying that
 
06:36:24.468 --> 06:36:24.478 align:start position:0%
can file
 
06:36:26.390 --> 06:36:26.400 align:start position:0%
or sponsor an amendment
 
06:36:29.030 --> 06:36:29.040 align:start position:0%
for a senate bill that's in the house
 
06:36:30.868 --> 06:36:30.878 align:start position:0%
they can still do that provided a member
 
06:36:33.430 --> 06:36:33.440 align:start position:0%
of this committee were to introduce it
 
06:36:35.030 --> 06:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
so it would have to be introduced by
 
06:36:36.310 --> 06:36:36.320 align:start position:0%
someone on the committee that's not a
 
06:36:36.320 --> 06:36:38.708 align:start position:0%
someone on the committee that's not a
substitute

06:36:38.708 --> 06:36:38.718 align:start position:0%
substitute
 
06:36:38.718 --> 06:36:40.948 align:start position:0%
substitute
so

06:36:40.948 --> 06:36:40.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:44.310 --> 06:36:44.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:44.320 --> 06:36:46.070 align:start position:0%
 
inquiry

06:36:46.070 --> 06:36:46.080 align:start position:0%
inquiry
 
06:36:49.510 --> 06:36:49.520 align:start position:0%
is it for certain that if we uh
 
06:36:51.910 --> 06:36:51.920 align:start position:0%
pass this bill today
 
06:36:54.868 --> 06:36:54.878 align:start position:0%
that we can reconsider the bill at
 
06:36:54.878 --> 06:36:57.990 align:start position:0%
that we can reconsider the bill at
another

06:36:57.990 --> 06:36:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:59.990 --> 06:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
we would have to reconsider it but the
 
06:37:02.230 --> 06:37:02.240 align:start position:0%
only day that we are scheduled to meet
 
06:37:04.628 --> 06:37:04.638 align:start position:0%
before the deadline is wednesday i
 
06:37:06.070 --> 06:37:06.080 align:start position:0%
although it's unlikely for us to have a
 
06:37:06.080 --> 06:37:07.830 align:start position:0%
although it's unlikely for us to have a
snowstorm

06:37:07.830 --> 06:37:07.840 align:start position:0%
snowstorm
 
06:37:07.840 --> 06:37:08.628 align:start position:0%
snowstorm
we

06:37:08.628 --> 06:37:08.638 align:start position:0%
we
 
06:37:10.390 --> 06:37:10.400 align:start position:0%
we had a lot of subcommittee hearings
 
06:37:12.628 --> 06:37:12.638 align:start position:0%
snowed out and i'm just saying if for
 
06:37:13.670 --> 06:37:13.680 align:start position:0%
some reason
 
06:37:15.110 --> 06:37:15.120 align:start position:0%
something whatever's going on that we
 
06:37:16.468 --> 06:37:16.478 align:start position:0%
can't make it on wednesday we don't meet
 
06:37:17.990 --> 06:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
the deadline so i would prefer to move
 
06:37:19.830 --> 06:37:19.840 align:start position:0%
it along at least we have a
 
06:37:19.840 --> 06:37:21.590 align:start position:0%
it along at least we have a
opportunity

06:37:21.590 --> 06:37:21.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
06:37:23.670 --> 06:37:23.680 align:start position:0%
and then then
 
06:37:23.680 --> 06:37:24.390 align:start position:0%
and then then
but

06:37:24.390 --> 06:37:24.400 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:37:26.628 --> 06:37:26.638 align:start position:0%
is it guaranteed
 
06:37:28.150 --> 06:37:28.160 align:start position:0%
i suppose i don't i have the as the
 
06:37:29.430 --> 06:37:29.440 align:start position:0%
chair have the discretion whether to
 
06:37:34.468 --> 06:37:34.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:36.390 --> 06:37:36.400 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you thank you
 
06:37:39.110 --> 06:37:39.120 align:start position:0%
we can they can clean this up in a uh
 
06:37:41.910 --> 06:37:41.920 align:start position:0%
in a committee of conference or not
 
06:37:43.270 --> 06:37:43.280 align:start position:0%
pass it now
 
06:37:44.548 --> 06:37:44.558 align:start position:0%
all right represent representative
 
06:37:44.558 --> 06:37:46.310 align:start position:0%
all right represent representative
welcome

06:37:46.310 --> 06:37:46.320 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
06:37:48.230 --> 06:37:48.240 align:start position:0%
yes this uh
 
06:37:51.590 --> 06:37:51.600 align:start position:0%
amendment it creates a position
 
06:37:53.270 --> 06:37:53.280 align:start position:0%
for the training
 
06:37:54.708 --> 06:37:54.718 align:start position:0%
why would we
 
06:37:56.390 --> 06:37:56.400 align:start position:0%

in light of the testimony we heard um
 
06:41:50.240 --> 06:41:51.270 align:start position:0%
in light of the testimony we heard um
from

06:41:51.270 --> 06:41:51.280 align:start position:0%
from
 
06:41:53.590 --> 06:41:53.600 align:start position:0%
that people who actually do the work
 
06:41:56.948 --> 06:41:56.958 align:start position:0%
they don't want this bill um and
 
06:41:59.110 --> 06:41:59.120 align:start position:0%
far be it for us to force them to accept
 
06:42:00.390 --> 06:42:00.400 align:start position:0%
money that they're never gonna get
 
06:42:04.230 --> 06:42:04.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:06.310 --> 06:42:06.320 align:start position:0%
representative espitia
 
06:42:06.320 --> 06:42:07.750 align:start position:0%
representative espitia
so

06:42:07.750 --> 06:42:07.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:42:10.230 --> 06:42:10.240 align:start position:0%
i agree with like you know i think
 
06:42:11.350 --> 06:42:11.360 align:start position:0%
i think they definitely don't want it
 
06:42:14.150 --> 06:42:14.160 align:start position:0%
and i get it um i think i want i was
 
06:42:16.230 --> 06:42:16.240 align:start position:0%
actually thinking about moving in um
 
06:42:18.230 --> 06:42:18.240 align:start position:0%
interim study i think i think that there
 
06:42:19.510 --> 06:42:19.520 align:start position:0%
is work that needs to be done on
 
06:42:21.190 --> 06:42:21.200 align:start position:0%
studying ways that we can actually pay
 
06:42:24.628 --> 06:42:24.638 align:start position:0%
our bill commissioners um because it is
 
06:42:27.430 --> 06:42:27.440 align:start position:0%
i mean it sounds like a rough gig um and
 
06:42:27.440 --> 06:42:28.230 align:start position:0%
i mean it sounds like a rough gig um and
and

06:42:28.230 --> 06:42:28.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:42:30.150 --> 06:42:30.160 align:start position:0%
um and they provide a service that's
 
06:42:32.150 --> 06:42:32.160 align:start position:0%
important to our state and the fact that
 
06:42:33.830 --> 06:42:33.840 align:start position:0%
they're not being properly compensated
 
06:42:36.628 --> 06:42:36.638 align:start position:0%
is is pretty it's pretty bad but um no
 
06:42:39.350 --> 06:42:39.360 align:start position:0%
i'll be supporting the itl motion and uh
 
06:42:39.360 --> 06:42:41.910 align:start position:0%
i'll be supporting the itl motion and uh
yeah

06:42:41.910 --> 06:42:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:46.390 --> 06:42:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:50.310 --> 06:42:50.320 align:start position:0%
yes i just had a question of uh we
 
06:42:52.150 --> 06:42:52.160 align:start position:0%
passed a bill in this committee i
 
06:42:53.590 --> 06:42:53.600 align:start position:0%
thought that said
 
06:42:56.548 --> 06:42:56.558 align:start position:0%
that the state would reimburse them did
 
06:43:00.868 --> 06:43:00.878 align:start position:0%
that get killed along the way
 
06:43:04.468 --> 06:43:04.478 align:start position:0%
i believe you're referring to hp 498. uh
 
06:43:05.750 --> 06:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
representative mitch i believe you were
 
06:43:05.760 --> 06:43:06.948 align:start position:0%
representative mitch i believe you were
a

06:43:06.948 --> 06:43:06.958 align:start position:0%
a
 
06:43:09.430 --> 06:43:09.440 align:start position:0%
sponsor a co-sponsor that bill what was
 
06:43:10.628 --> 06:43:10.638 align:start position:0%
do you mind just telling the me what the
 
06:43:15.190 --> 06:43:15.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:17.590 --> 06:43:17.600 align:start position:0%
i believe that i
 
06:43:19.030 --> 06:43:19.040 align:start position:0%
i would have to i would actually have to
 
06:43:20.948 --> 06:43:20.958 align:start position:0%
look it up to be honest with you i know
 
06:43:22.868 --> 06:43:22.878 align:start position:0%
it it passed in this committee with a
 
06:43:24.708 --> 06:43:24.718 align:start position:0%
positive recommendation passed it passed
 
06:43:26.390 --> 06:43:26.400 align:start position:0%
on the house floor as well what i'm not
 
06:43:28.390 --> 06:43:28.400 align:start position:0%
sure of is what happened in the senate
 
06:43:30.390 --> 06:43:30.400 align:start position:0%
uh and what happened with funding which
 
06:43:30.400 --> 06:43:31.510 align:start position:0%
uh and what happened with funding which
was

06:43:31.510 --> 06:43:31.520 align:start position:0%
was
 
06:43:33.590 --> 06:43:33.600 align:start position:0%
it it may not have made it out it was a
 
06:43:34.628 --> 06:43:34.638 align:start position:0%
may not have made out of the house
 
06:43:37.750 --> 06:43:37.760 align:start position:0%
finance committee either way it's it
 
06:43:39.430 --> 06:43:39.440 align:start position:0%
i was fine it did not make it out of the
 
06:43:41.750 --> 06:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
house finance committee so that that was
 
06:43:41.760 --> 06:43:42.868 align:start position:0%
house finance committee so that that was
the

06:43:42.868 --> 06:43:42.878 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:43:45.030 --> 06:43:45.040 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chairman
 
06:43:51.990 --> 06:43:52.000 align:start position:0%
uh one of the reasons i
 
06:43:54.310 --> 06:43:54.320 align:start position:0%
oppose the itl motion
 
06:43:55.590 --> 06:43:55.600 align:start position:0%
is because
 
06:43:55.600 --> 06:43:56.788 align:start position:0%
is because
um

06:43:56.788 --> 06:43:56.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:43:58.948 --> 06:43:58.958 align:start position:0%
i realize that the bill commissioners
 
06:44:00.230 --> 06:44:00.240 align:start position:0%
are being
 
06:44:00.240 --> 06:44:01.430 align:start position:0%
are being
stiffed

06:44:01.430 --> 06:44:01.440 align:start position:0%
stiffed
 
06:44:04.070 --> 06:44:04.080 align:start position:0%
for both their fees
 
06:44:05.430 --> 06:44:05.440 align:start position:0%
and their
 
06:44:05.440 --> 06:44:06.548 align:start position:0%
and their
uh

06:44:06.548 --> 06:44:06.558 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:44:06.558 --> 06:44:07.990 align:start position:0%
uh
outage

06:44:07.990 --> 06:44:08.000 align:start position:0%
outage
 
06:44:10.390 --> 06:44:10.400 align:start position:0%
but i'm hoping that one day
 
06:44:10.400 --> 06:44:11.190 align:start position:0%
but i'm hoping that one day
that

06:44:11.190 --> 06:44:11.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:44:14.948 --> 06:44:14.958 align:start position:0%
uh they will become uh
 
06:44:18.788 --> 06:44:18.798 align:start position:0%
actually employed by the the court
 
06:44:22.310 --> 06:44:22.320 align:start position:0%
and be paid for their services
 
06:44:25.590 --> 06:44:25.600 align:start position:0%
and at that time we will have be on the
 
06:44:28.708 --> 06:44:28.718 align:start position:0%
record that the outage that they would
 
06:44:28.718 --> 06:44:29.590 align:start position:0%
record that the outage that they would
be

06:44:29.590 --> 06:44:29.600 align:start position:0%
be
 
06:44:29.600 --> 06:44:30.708 align:start position:0%
be
uh

06:44:30.708 --> 06:44:30.718 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:44:31.830 --> 06:44:31.840 align:start position:0%
paid for
 
06:44:34.310 --> 06:44:34.320 align:start position:0%
are is already on record that they
 
06:44:35.830 --> 06:44:35.840 align:start position:0%
should be paid for
 
06:44:35.840 --> 06:44:36.948 align:start position:0%
should be paid for
so

06:44:36.948 --> 06:44:36.958 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:44:40.070 --> 06:44:40.080 align:start position:0%
having a policy in
 
06:44:42.230 --> 06:44:42.240 align:start position:0%
rsas say
 
06:44:45.670 --> 06:44:45.680 align:start position:0%
that they are entitled to mileage
 
06:44:48.628 --> 06:44:48.638 align:start position:0%
if they are then paid by the court would
 
06:44:50.548 --> 06:44:50.558 align:start position:0%
not only get their fee
 
06:44:53.350 --> 06:44:53.360 align:start position:0%
but also their knowledge
 
06:44:55.030 --> 06:44:55.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:44:55.040 --> 06:44:55.830 align:start position:0%
thank you
and

06:44:55.830 --> 06:44:55.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:44:57.910 --> 06:44:57.920 align:start position:0%
if there was ever any type of magistrate
 
06:44:57.920 --> 06:45:01.670 align:start position:0%
if there was ever any type of magistrate
system

06:45:01.670 --> 06:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:03.430 --> 06:45:03.440 align:start position:0%
if there was ever a magistrate system i
 
06:45:04.628 --> 06:45:04.638 align:start position:0%
would hope that
 
06:45:06.788 --> 06:45:06.798 align:start position:0%
that policy would give or provide some
 
06:45:08.468 --> 06:45:08.478 align:start position:0%
type of special consideration for the
 
06:45:10.150 --> 06:45:10.160 align:start position:0%
bail commissioners who've worked very
 
06:45:12.708 --> 06:45:12.718 align:start position:0%
hard doing a public service for a long
 
06:45:15.430 --> 06:45:15.440 align:start position:0%
time and have you said
 
06:45:15.440 --> 06:45:16.468 align:start position:0%
time and have you said
been

06:45:16.468 --> 06:45:16.478 align:start position:0%
been
 
06:45:16.478 --> 06:45:18.070 align:start position:0%
been
been

06:45:18.070 --> 06:45:18.080 align:start position:0%
been
 
06:45:22.070 --> 06:45:22.080 align:start position:0%
been stiffed as we say on being paid so
 
06:45:23.670 --> 06:45:23.680 align:start position:0%
that's just my take on it representative
 
06:45:23.680 --> 06:45:25.270 align:start position:0%
that's just my take on it representative
pandelagas

06:45:25.270 --> 06:45:25.280 align:start position:0%
pandelagas
 
06:45:27.190 --> 06:45:27.200 align:start position:0%
i just couldn't vote for it because i
 
06:45:30.150 --> 06:45:30.160 align:start position:0%
don't think it's fair if you have nine
 
06:45:30.160 --> 06:45:31.510 align:start position:0%
don't think it's fair if you have nine
clients

06:45:31.510 --> 06:45:31.520 align:start position:0%
clients
 
06:45:33.590 --> 06:45:33.600 align:start position:0%
got the merrimack jail
 
06:45:35.270 --> 06:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
and only one of them is going to be
 
06:45:51.430 --> 06:45:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:53.990 --> 06:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
representative harry garth
 
06:45:55.110 --> 06:45:55.120 align:start position:0%
i don't know i think i'm feeling a
 
06:45:56.628 --> 06:45:56.638 align:start position:0%
little differently about this because i
 
06:45:59.190 --> 06:45:59.200 align:start position:0%
looked at the hearing notes from the
 
06:45:59.200 --> 06:46:00.150 align:start position:0%
looked at the hearing notes from the
senate

06:46:00.150 --> 06:46:00.160 align:start position:0%
senate
 
06:46:02.070 --> 06:46:02.080 align:start position:0%
and it says summary of testimony
 
06:46:05.830 --> 06:46:05.840 align:start position:0%
presented in opposition none
 
06:46:07.670 --> 06:46:07.680 align:start position:0%
so i'm just curious
 
06:46:09.510 --> 06:46:09.520 align:start position:0%
and it lists some of the same folks that
 
06:46:09.520 --> 06:46:10.788 align:start position:0%
and it lists some of the same folks that
testified

06:46:10.788 --> 06:46:10.798 align:start position:0%
testified
 
06:46:12.390 --> 06:46:12.400 align:start position:0%
and i'm just
 
06:46:15.190 --> 06:46:15.200 align:start position:0%
i think if if the senator was here might
 
06:46:16.708 --> 06:46:16.718 align:start position:0%
have went differently
 
06:46:18.948 --> 06:46:18.958 align:start position:0%
i i will tell you that
 
06:46:20.708 --> 06:46:20.718 align:start position:0%
assuming that information is accurate i
 
06:46:22.548 --> 06:46:22.558 align:start position:0%
can say they clearly change their mind
 
06:46:22.558 --> 06:46:23.670 align:start position:0%
can say they clearly change their mind
no

06:46:23.670 --> 06:46:23.680 align:start position:0%
no
 
06:46:25.510 --> 06:46:25.520 align:start position:0%
but they're all shaking their head no
 
06:46:27.510 --> 06:46:27.520 align:start position:0%
but even if even if they were yes
 
06:46:29.190 --> 06:46:29.200 align:start position:0%
they've changed their mind clearly based
 
06:46:31.350 --> 06:46:31.360 align:start position:0%
on the testimony given to this committee
 
06:46:32.468 --> 06:46:32.478 align:start position:0%
that's true
 
06:46:34.070 --> 06:46:34.080 align:start position:0%
but i i from what i understand they even
 
06:46:35.190 --> 06:46:35.200 align:start position:0%
disagree that he changed their mind
 
06:46:36.468 --> 06:46:36.478 align:start position:0%
they're saying that they were opposed to
 
06:46:42.230 --> 06:46:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:45.030 --> 06:46:45.040 align:start position:0%
blame it on the clerk
 
06:46:49.670 --> 06:46:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:51.670 --> 06:46:51.680 align:start position:0%
i i believe the committee report was
 
06:46:55.270 --> 06:46:55.280 align:start position:0%
referring to remote testimony
 
06:46:57.190 --> 06:46:57.200 align:start position:0%
uh submitted against i'm not sure it may
 
06:46:58.788 --> 06:46:58.798 align:start position:0%
just be an error in the committee report
 
06:47:00.468 --> 06:47:00.478 align:start position:0%
but there were these people were at the
 
06:47:01.750 --> 06:47:01.760 align:start position:0%
senate hearing and did oppose the bill
 
06:47:03.510 --> 06:47:03.520 align:start position:0%
at the time
 
06:47:07.670 --> 06:47:07.680 align:start position:0%

uh i believe it was one of the bills
 
06:47:23.110 --> 06:47:23.120 align:start position:0%
that didn't make it because of covet

06:50:52.948 --> 06:50:52.958 align:start position:0%
because it
 
06:50:52.958 --> 06:50:55.990 align:start position:0%
because it
it's

06:50:55.990 --> 06:50:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:56.000 --> 06:50:56.708 align:start position:0%
 
but

06:50:56.708 --> 06:50:56.718 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:50:56.718 --> 06:50:57.670 align:start position:0%
but
um

06:50:57.670 --> 06:50:57.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:50:59.190 --> 06:50:59.200 align:start position:0%
but that was on the
 
06:51:01.430 --> 06:51:01.440 align:start position:0%
um amen
 
06:51:03.110 --> 06:51:03.120 align:start position:0%
it's not proposed there's a drafted
 
06:51:05.030 --> 06:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
amendment actually drafted
 
06:51:05.040 --> 06:51:06.070 align:start position:0%
amendment actually drafted
correctly

06:51:06.070 --> 06:51:06.080 align:start position:0%
correctly
 
06:51:09.670 --> 06:51:09.680 align:start position:0%
that's amendment number 2022-1
 
06:51:11.990 --> 06:51:12.000 align:start position:0%
339s which
 
06:51:14.708 --> 06:51:14.718 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't support the amendment myself
 
06:51:16.230 --> 06:51:16.240 align:start position:0%
but what i'm saying is with this
 
06:51:17.910 --> 06:51:17.920 align:start position:0%
amendment yeah
 
06:51:17.920 --> 06:51:18.788 align:start position:0%
amendment yeah
uh

06:51:18.788 --> 06:51:18.798 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:51:19.910 --> 06:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
they're talking about the language and
 
06:51:22.548 --> 06:51:22.558 align:start position:0%
the amendment uh the motion is ought to
 
06:51:25.510 --> 06:51:25.520 align:start position:0%
pass on the under just so and also they
 
06:51:26.948 --> 06:51:26.958 align:start position:0%
did say though the reason they need the
 
06:51:28.868 --> 06:51:28.878 align:start position:0%
amendment is so that they can be able to
 
06:51:29.990 --> 06:51:30.000 align:start position:0%
give the money straight to
 
06:51:30.000 --> 06:51:32.150 align:start position:0%
give the money straight to
municipalities

06:51:32.150 --> 06:51:32.160 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
06:51:33.990 --> 06:51:34.000 align:start position:0%
because otherwise as drafted right now
 
06:51:35.910 --> 06:51:35.920 align:start position:0%
apparently they don't have the mechanism
 
06:51:37.590 --> 06:51:37.600 align:start position:0%
to do that but you can give that to the
 
06:51:40.868 --> 06:51:40.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:43.670 --> 06:51:43.680 align:start position:0%
so my interest my understanding is right
 
06:51:45.670 --> 06:51:45.680 align:start position:0%
right now if this
 
06:51:48.390 --> 06:51:48.400 align:start position:0%
the money can't be used to offset
 
06:51:49.510 --> 06:51:49.520 align:start position:0%
local funds that have already been
 
06:51:51.670 --> 06:51:51.680 align:start position:0%
budgeted or appropriate
 
06:51:51.680 --> 06:51:52.548 align:start position:0%
budgeted or appropriate
so

06:51:52.548 --> 06:51:52.558 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:51:54.150 --> 06:51:54.160 align:start position:0%
if that's the case
 
06:51:54.160 --> 06:51:55.670 align:start position:0%
if that's the case
any

06:51:55.670 --> 06:51:55.680 align:start position:0%
any
 
06:51:58.468 --> 06:51:58.478 align:start position:0%
these funds for the year of 2022
 
06:52:00.070 --> 06:52:00.080 align:start position:0%
suppose unless the town didn't pass a
 
06:52:00.080 --> 06:52:01.830 align:start position:0%
suppose unless the town didn't pass a
budget

06:52:01.830 --> 06:52:01.840 align:start position:0%
budget
 
06:52:03.350 --> 06:52:03.360 align:start position:0%
they would have already appropriated at
 
06:52:04.548 --> 06:52:04.558 align:start position:0%
least they're in the process of doing
 
06:52:04.558 --> 06:52:05.670 align:start position:0%
least they're in the process of doing
that

06:52:05.670 --> 06:52:05.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:52:05.680 --> 06:52:06.390 align:start position:0%
that
so

06:52:06.390 --> 06:52:06.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:52:08.070 --> 06:52:08.080 align:start position:0%
for 20 it would have to be for something
 
06:52:11.910 --> 06:52:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:13.670 --> 06:52:13.680 align:start position:0%
which the underlying bill would do so i
 
06:52:15.110 --> 06:52:15.120 align:start position:0%
was not clear that the amendment was
 
06:52:16.548 --> 06:52:16.558 align:start position:0%
that's just my interpretation that that
 
06:52:18.548 --> 06:52:18.558 align:start position:0%
amendment would not have
 
06:52:19.430 --> 06:52:19.440 align:start position:0%
if i'm
 
06:52:21.350 --> 06:52:21.360 align:start position:0%
and that's just my
 
06:52:22.788 --> 06:52:22.798 align:start position:0%
i always like to say i sound correct it
 
06:52:25.910 --> 06:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean i am i i understood that it
 
06:52:28.310 --> 06:52:28.320 align:start position:0%
needed to change because you could not
 
06:52:30.310 --> 06:52:30.320 align:start position:0%
use it on
 
06:52:37.030 --> 06:52:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:39.030 --> 06:52:39.040 align:start position:0%
that is in the proposed amendment the
 
06:52:41.110 --> 06:52:41.120 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment contains that flaw if
 
06:52:42.868 --> 06:52:42.878 align:start position:0%
it were to be entertained by the
 
06:52:44.708 --> 06:52:44.718 align:start position:0%
committee would need to have some
 
06:52:47.430 --> 06:52:47.440 align:start position:0%
grammatical changes representative
 
06:52:49.430 --> 06:52:49.440 align:start position:0%
and my understanding of what the
 
06:52:51.590 --> 06:52:51.600 align:start position:0%
municipal association person was saying
 
06:52:52.708 --> 06:52:52.718 align:start position:0%
was that
 
06:52:55.510 --> 06:52:55.520 align:start position:0%
the funds couldn't supplement
 
06:52:58.868 --> 06:52:58.878 align:start position:0%
monies that were otherwise to be used
 
06:53:00.310 --> 06:53:00.320 align:start position:0%
but that
 
06:53:02.708 --> 06:53:02.718 align:start position:0%
in the case of monies that could be
 
06:53:05.990 --> 06:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
available in 2022
 
06:53:08.150 --> 06:53:08.160 align:start position:0%
the town couldn't accept them if they
 
06:53:09.830 --> 06:53:09.840 align:start position:0%
hadn't passed
 
06:53:12.948 --> 06:53:12.958 align:start position:0%
a certain rsa applicable to their town
 
06:53:15.350 --> 06:53:15.360 align:start position:0%
without this
 
06:53:17.590 --> 06:53:17.600 align:start position:0%
enabling aspect
 
06:53:17.600 --> 06:53:18.468 align:start position:0%
enabling aspect
um

06:53:18.468 --> 06:53:18.478 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:53:20.390 --> 06:53:20.400 align:start position:0%
and that was what she was trying to
 
06:53:22.868 --> 06:53:22.878 align:start position:0%
correct with the addition
 
06:53:22.878 --> 06:53:24.390 align:start position:0%
correct with the addition
uh

06:53:24.390 --> 06:53:24.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:53:27.510 --> 06:53:27.520 align:start position:0%
not the town one but the other one
 
06:53:29.590 --> 06:53:29.600 align:start position:0%
my own point is if the town hasn't
 
06:53:30.788 --> 06:53:30.798 align:start position:0%
improved the use of the money because
 
06:53:33.270 --> 06:53:33.280 align:start position:0%
that money is only going to apply to a
 
06:53:33.280 --> 06:53:34.310 align:start position:0%
that money is only going to apply to a
partial

06:53:34.310 --> 06:53:34.320 align:start position:0%
partial
 
06:53:36.230 --> 06:53:36.240 align:start position:0%
part of the project here
 
06:53:37.910 --> 06:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
if the town hasn't approved it yet that
 
06:53:39.910 --> 06:53:39.920 align:start position:0%
money could be held up waiting for that
 
06:53:41.910 --> 06:53:41.920 align:start position:0%
town to approve it and it may not even
 
06:53:43.750 --> 06:53:43.760 align:start position:0%
get approved meanwhile other communities
 
06:53:43.760 --> 06:53:44.948 align:start position:0%
get approved meanwhile other communities
may

06:53:44.948 --> 06:53:44.958 align:start position:0%
may
 
06:53:45.830 --> 06:53:45.840 align:start position:0%
have may
 
06:53:47.590 --> 06:53:47.600 align:start position:0%
already approved it and they would be
 
06:53:49.270 --> 06:53:49.280 align:start position:0%
they might not be eligible
 
06:53:51.670 --> 06:53:51.680 align:start position:0%
i mean every town has the opportunity to
 
06:53:53.430 --> 06:53:53.440 align:start position:0%
put these applications in whether it's
 
06:53:55.590 --> 06:53:55.600 align:start position:0%
through warrendark whatever their their
 
06:53:57.990 --> 06:53:58.000 align:start position:0%
local government system is so they're
 
06:53:59.830 --> 06:53:59.840 align:start position:0%
all entitled to do that
 
06:54:01.350 --> 06:54:01.360 align:start position:0%
so i don't if they haven't done that
 
06:54:01.360 --> 06:54:02.230 align:start position:0%
so i don't if they haven't done that
already

06:54:02.230 --> 06:54:02.240 align:start position:0%
already
 
06:54:04.390 --> 06:54:04.400 align:start position:0%
but that money could be held up i mean
 
06:54:05.750 --> 06:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
that in a bad way but let's say they
 
06:54:07.190 --> 06:54:07.200 align:start position:0%
hold it up in the town for whatever
 
06:54:09.990 --> 06:54:10.000 align:start position:0%
reason doesn't pass the warrant article
 
06:54:10.000 --> 06:54:11.590 align:start position:0%
reason doesn't pass the warrant article
so

06:54:11.590 --> 06:54:11.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:54:14.390 --> 06:54:14.400 align:start position:0%
representative another freshman question
 
06:54:16.468 --> 06:54:16.478 align:start position:0%
um since this is going to a second
 
06:54:18.390 --> 06:54:18.400 align:start position:0%
committee can a
 
06:54:20.948 --> 06:54:20.958 align:start position:0%
representative from this committee who
 
06:54:23.670 --> 06:54:23.680 align:start position:0%
likes the amendment and wants to fix it
 
06:54:25.110 --> 06:54:25.120 align:start position:0%
can they get it
 
06:54:27.590 --> 06:54:27.600 align:start position:0%
fixed and run through ols and present it
 
06:54:30.548 --> 06:54:30.558 align:start position:0%
at the next committee
 
06:54:50.868 --> 06:54:50.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:52.708 --> 06:54:52.718 align:start position:0%
this is a second committee bill
 
06:54:52.718 --> 06:54:53.590 align:start position:0%
this is a second committee bill
that's

06:54:53.590 --> 06:54:53.600 align:start position:0%
that's
 
06:54:58.390 --> 06:54:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:01.030 --> 06:55:01.040 align:start position:0%
i'm just explaining i'm not sure the
 
06:55:04.468 --> 06:55:04.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:06.548 --> 06:55:06.558 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure it's necessary for what
 
06:55:09.430 --> 06:55:09.440 align:start position:0%
this is trying to accomplish
 
06:55:09.440 --> 06:55:10.310 align:start position:0%
this is trying to accomplish
so

06:55:10.310 --> 06:55:10.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:55:12.868 --> 06:55:12.878 align:start position:0%
another 29 applications
 
06:55:15.590 --> 06:55:15.600 align:start position:0%
made for the camera grants 29 were
 
06:55:15.600 --> 06:55:18.070 align:start position:0%
made for the camera grants 29 were
granted

06:55:18.070 --> 06:55:18.080 align:start position:0%
granted
 
06:55:26.230 --> 06:55:26.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:27.510 --> 06:55:27.520 align:start position:0%
the reason i brought it up is i don't
 
06:55:29.750 --> 06:55:29.760 align:start position:0%
think the municipal association would
 
06:55:31.670 --> 06:55:31.680 align:start position:0%
have brought it up to us if they didn't
 
06:55:33.270 --> 06:55:33.280 align:start position:0%
think it was important if they were just
 
06:55:35.590 --> 06:55:35.600 align:start position:0%
like oh it's not a big deal like i think
 
06:55:37.430 --> 06:55:37.440 align:start position:0%
i think they meant to but like i said
 
06:55:39.590 --> 06:55:39.600 align:start position:0%
can we handle another committee so it's
 
06:55:39.600 --> 06:55:40.788 align:start position:0%
can we handle another committee so it's
funny

06:55:40.788 --> 06:55:40.798 align:start position:0%
funny
 
06:55:40.798 --> 06:55:41.990 align:start position:0%
funny
well

06:55:41.990 --> 06:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
well
 
06:55:44.070 --> 06:55:44.080 align:start position:0%
i think it's it's in fairness someone
 
06:55:45.990 --> 06:55:46.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned an amendment i don't the
 
06:55:48.548 --> 06:55:48.558 align:start position:0%
witness i haven't looked at that we gave
 
06:55:49.750 --> 06:55:49.760 align:start position:0%
her the witness an opportunity to look
 
06:55:52.948 --> 06:55:52.958 align:start position:0%
at it and they said well if you were to
 
06:55:55.030 --> 06:55:55.040 align:start position:0%
consider that this is some grammatical
 
06:55:55.040 --> 06:55:55.990 align:start position:0%
consider that this is some grammatical
issues

06:55:55.990 --> 06:55:56.000 align:start position:0%
issues
 
06:55:57.510 --> 06:55:57.520 align:start position:0%
there was more guidance on which was
 
06:55:59.270 --> 06:55:59.280 align:start position:0%
appreciated but i don't
 
06:56:00.628 --> 06:56:00.638 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure we're going to consider
 
06:56:02.788 --> 06:56:02.798 align:start position:0%
that amendment
 
06:56:04.868 --> 06:56:04.878 align:start position:0%
representative walls thank you mr
 
06:56:06.548 --> 06:56:06.558 align:start position:0%
chairman the
 
06:56:09.270 --> 06:56:09.280 align:start position:0%
catherine from the municipal association
 
06:56:11.750 --> 06:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
and i quote strongly supports and
 
06:56:15.030 --> 06:56:15.040 align:start position:0%
suggests an amendment so
 
06:56:16.708 --> 06:56:16.718 align:start position:0%
just take it you know as it is she
 
06:56:18.468 --> 06:56:18.478 align:start position:0%
strongly supports it but would suggest
 
06:56:24.230 --> 06:56:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:56:26.070 --> 06:56:26.080 align:start position:0%
okay mr chairman
 
06:56:27.750 --> 06:56:27.760 align:start position:0%
representative i might point out that
 
06:56:29.830 --> 06:56:29.840 align:start position:0%
this will probably go to finance and the

especially for communities that
 
06:58:27.270 --> 06:58:27.280 align:start position:0%

06:58:28.788 --> 06:58:28.798 align:start position:0%
might need the money to cover all their
 
06:58:28.798 --> 06:58:31.270 align:start position:0%
might need the money to cover all their
stuff

06:58:31.270 --> 06:58:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:33.350 --> 06:58:33.360 align:start position:0%

06:58:43.030 --> 06:58:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:45.590 --> 06:58:45.600 align:start position:0%
is the uh privacy
 
06:58:45.600 --> 06:58:46.628 align:start position:0%
is the uh privacy
issues

06:58:46.628 --> 06:58:46.638 align:start position:0%
issues
 
06:58:50.390 --> 06:58:50.400 align:start position:0%
uh with d.o.t i support d.o.t having
 
06:58:53.750 --> 06:58:53.760 align:start position:0%
dash cams in rear cams i have them in my
 
06:58:53.760 --> 06:58:56.468 align:start position:0%
dash cams in rear cams i have them in my
vehicle

06:58:56.468 --> 06:58:56.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:58.230 --> 06:58:58.240 align:start position:0%
i think it's smart for everybody to have
 
06:58:59.750 --> 06:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
a dash cam
 
06:59:01.510 --> 06:59:01.520 align:start position:0%
where i have a problem is when the
 
06:59:03.270 --> 06:59:03.280 align:start position:0%
gentleman said
 
06:59:05.910 --> 06:59:05.920 align:start position:0%
when i asked him what is going to happen
 
06:59:07.750 --> 06:59:07.760 align:start position:0%
you know within that three days before
 
06:59:09.110 --> 06:59:09.120 align:start position:0%
it's deleted
 
06:59:11.830 --> 06:59:11.840 align:start position:0%
can somebody else another department or
 
06:59:13.270 --> 06:59:13.280 align:start position:0%
anybody really
 
06:59:16.310 --> 06:59:16.320 align:start position:0%
come in and grab that footage and he
 
06:59:18.628 --> 06:59:18.638 align:start position:0%
said yes
 
06:59:21.110 --> 06:59:21.120 align:start position:0%
i know the dot
 
06:59:24.070 --> 06:59:24.080 align:start position:0%
easy pass is deleted fairly quickly i
 
06:59:26.230 --> 06:59:26.240 align:start position:0%
think almost immediately once uh you
 
06:59:28.310 --> 06:59:28.320 align:start position:0%
know a member here said that
 
06:59:29.590 --> 06:59:29.600 align:start position:0%
the plate is
 
06:59:33.350 --> 06:59:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:59:35.990 --> 06:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
that is what i want to support as if
 
06:59:38.150 --> 06:59:38.160 align:start position:0%
that dash cam there was no accidents
 
06:59:40.230 --> 06:59:40.240 align:start position:0%
that day there was no murders in front
 
06:59:42.390 --> 06:59:42.400 align:start position:0%
of that vehicle uh there was no
 
06:59:44.788 --> 06:59:44.798 align:start position:0%
robberies in front of that vehicle um
 
06:59:46.868 --> 06:59:46.878 align:start position:0%
you know there was no crimes around that
 
06:59:51.590 --> 06:59:51.600 align:start position:0%
vehicle then in my eyes for privacy
 
06:59:53.030 --> 06:59:53.040 align:start position:0%
it should be
 
06:59:55.030 --> 06:59:55.040 align:start position:0%
removed immediately
 
06:59:55.040 --> 06:59:56.628 align:start position:0%
removed immediately
because

06:59:56.628 --> 06:59:56.638 align:start position:0%
because
 
06:59:59.030 --> 06:59:59.040 align:start position:0%
i do not want the government to have one
 
07:00:00.948 --> 07:00:00.958 align:start position:0%
more avenue
 
07:00:00.958 --> 07:00:02.390 align:start position:0%
more avenue
of

07:00:02.390 --> 07:00:02.400 align:start position:0%
of
 
07:00:04.628 --> 07:00:04.638 align:start position:0%
seeing who's doing what driving down
 
07:00:05.990 --> 07:00:06.000 align:start position:0%
what road
 
07:00:08.708 --> 07:00:08.718 align:start position:0%
we have been very clear in new hampshire
 
07:00:11.350 --> 07:00:11.360 align:start position:0%
against that we passed constitutional
 
07:00:14.310 --> 07:00:14.320 align:start position:0%
amendments to make sure that our privacy
 
07:00:16.708 --> 07:00:16.718 align:start position:0%
is upheld in new hampshire
 
07:00:18.948 --> 07:00:18.958 align:start position:0%
and here we are going to
 
07:00:21.990 --> 07:00:22.000 align:start position:0%
support a bill that can allow somebody
 
07:00:24.230 --> 07:00:24.240 align:start position:0%
to go in and grab that footage before
 
07:00:25.430 --> 07:00:25.440 align:start position:0%
the d.o.t
 
07:00:27.750 --> 07:00:27.760 align:start position:0%
deletes it on the third day
 
07:00:30.310 --> 07:00:30.320 align:start position:0%
and he even said yeah we can keep it if
 
07:00:30.320 --> 07:00:31.030 align:start position:0%
and he even said yeah we can keep it if
we

07:00:31.030 --> 07:00:31.040 align:start position:0%
we
 
07:00:32.628 --> 07:00:32.638 align:start position:0%
think we should use it for training
 
07:00:32.638 --> 07:00:33.830 align:start position:0%
think we should use it for training
purposes

07:00:33.830 --> 07:00:33.840 align:start position:0%
purposes
 
07:00:36.310 --> 07:00:36.320 align:start position:0%
um you know this is not what this is
 
07:00:39.030 --> 07:00:39.040 align:start position:0%
supposed to be for is to protect the
 
07:00:39.040 --> 07:00:41.350 align:start position:0%
supposed to be for is to protect the
workers

07:00:41.350 --> 07:00:41.360 align:start position:0%
workers
 
07:00:44.948 --> 07:00:44.958 align:start position:0%
you know in crashes uh it protects
 
07:00:46.788 --> 07:00:46.798 align:start position:0%
you know our our
 
07:00:49.510 --> 07:00:49.520 align:start position:0%
cost of the vehicles um you know to make
 
07:00:51.590 --> 07:00:51.600 align:start position:0%
sure that we know who is did the
 
07:00:54.390 --> 07:00:54.400 align:start position:0%
accident you know whose fault um
 
07:00:56.628 --> 07:00:56.638 align:start position:0%
you know i support cameras
 
07:00:59.430 --> 07:00:59.440 align:start position:0%
um it's just this one piece and i do
 
07:00:59.440 --> 07:01:00.468 align:start position:0%
um it's just this one piece and i do
support

07:01:00.468 --> 07:01:00.478 align:start position:0%
support
 
07:01:02.390 --> 07:01:02.400 align:start position:0%
the bridges um
 
07:01:05.430 --> 07:01:05.440 align:start position:0%
you know that need to be fixed so i hope
 
07:01:07.990 --> 07:01:08.000 align:start position:0%
the senate fixes this problem so at the
 
07:01:10.390 --> 07:01:10.400 align:start position:0%
end i can vote for it in the house but
 
07:01:16.230 --> 07:01:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:01:21.990 --> 07:01:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:01:22.000 --> 07:01:25.750 align:start position:0%
 
yes

07:01:25.750 --> 07:01:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:01:25.760 --> 07:01:26.548 align:start position:0%
 
uh

07:01:26.548 --> 07:01:26.558 align:start position:0%
uh
 
07:01:26.558 --> 07:01:27.830 align:start position:0%
uh
on

07:01:27.830 --> 07:01:27.840 align:start position:0%
on
 
07:01:29.270 --> 07:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
on lines
 
07:01:31.910 --> 07:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
22 to 24 it says the stored recording
 
07:01:34.310 --> 07:01:34.320 align:start position:0%
may only be used by the requesting party
 
07:01:36.390 --> 07:01:36.400 align:start position:0%
for a lawful purpose including as
 
07:01:36.400 --> 07:01:37.510 align:start position:0%
for a lawful purpose including as
evidence

07:01:37.510 --> 07:01:37.520 align:start position:0%
evidence
 
07:01:39.110 --> 07:01:39.120 align:start position:0%
in a judicial or administrative
 
07:01:39.120 --> 07:01:42.230 align:start position:0%
in a judicial or administrative
proceeding

07:01:42.230 --> 07:01:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:01:42.240 --> 07:01:43.750 align:start position:0%
 
so

07:01:43.750 --> 07:01:43.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:01:45.430 --> 07:01:45.440 align:start position:0%
i'm asking
 
07:01:47.190 --> 07:01:47.200 align:start position:0%
if someone were just to walk into the
 
07:01:47.200 --> 07:01:48.788 align:start position:0%
if someone were just to walk into the
room

07:01:48.788 --> 07:01:48.798 align:start position:0%
room
 
07:01:48.798 --> 07:01:49.990 align:start position:0%
room
from

07:01:49.990 --> 07:01:50.000 align:start position:0%
from
 
07:01:52.070 --> 07:01:52.080 align:start position:0%
whatever part of the government without
 
07:01:54.548 --> 07:01:54.558 align:start position:0%
any explanation why they want to make
 
07:01:56.708 --> 07:01:56.718 align:start position:0%
a copy of the recording
 
07:01:58.868 --> 07:01:58.878 align:start position:0%
do you believe that that would be
 
07:02:01.110 --> 07:02:01.120 align:start position:0%
permitted under the paragraph i mean i
 
07:02:02.628 --> 07:02:02.638 align:start position:0%
read that as they have to have a lawful
 
07:02:04.788 --> 07:02:04.798 align:start position:0%
purpose for asking for it to be stored
 
07:02:06.230 --> 07:02:06.240 align:start position:0%
longer than three days
 
07:02:23.590 --> 07:02:23.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:02:26.310 --> 07:02:26.320 align:start position:0%
the way i'm reading it is that another
 
07:02:29.350 --> 07:02:29.360 align:start position:0%
government agency can request
 
07:02:31.270 --> 07:02:31.280 align:start position:0%
the footage
 
07:02:33.990 --> 07:02:34.000 align:start position:0%
and at that point then it's free as far
 
07:02:36.468 --> 07:02:36.478 align:start position:0%
as i'm concerned for that agency you
 
07:02:39.510 --> 07:02:39.520 align:start position:0%
know i i'd be nervous on why they need
 
07:02:41.590 --> 07:02:41.600 align:start position:0%
it and what it's for
 
07:02:43.830 --> 07:02:43.840 align:start position:0%
again new hampshire we've passed
 
07:02:47.350 --> 07:02:47.360 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendments that's huge
 
07:02:50.868 --> 07:02:50.878 align:start position:0%
to protect our privacy against
 
07:02:50.878 --> 07:02:51.910 align:start position:0%
to protect our privacy against
government

07:02:51.910 --> 07:02:51.920 align:start position:0%
government
 
07:02:54.468 --> 07:02:54.478 align:start position:0%
and we have to maintain that in new
 
07:02:54.478 --> 07:02:55.990 align:start position:0%
and we have to maintain that in new
hampshire

07:02:55.990 --> 07:02:56.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
07:02:58.230 --> 07:02:58.240 align:start position:0%
and so the way i'm reading it is you
 
07:02:59.750 --> 07:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
know they have to delete it in three
 
07:02:59.760 --> 07:03:02.230 align:start position:0%
know they have to delete it in three
days

07:03:02.230 --> 07:03:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:03:04.070 --> 07:03:04.080 align:start position:0%
but if i understood the gentleman from
 
07:03:07.350 --> 07:03:07.360 align:start position:0%
d.o.t he said that they can keep the you
 
07:03:09.510 --> 07:03:09.520 align:start position:0%
know which is right here it says it here
 
07:03:11.670 --> 07:03:11.680 align:start position:0%
that they can keep it if they seem
 
07:03:13.670 --> 07:03:13.680 align:start position:0%
you know that they want to keep it
 
07:03:15.910 --> 07:03:15.920 align:start position:0%
um and i'm reading administrative
 
07:03:15.920 --> 07:03:17.750 align:start position:0%
um and i'm reading administrative
proceedings

07:03:17.750 --> 07:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
proceedings
 
07:03:17.760 --> 07:03:18.708 align:start position:0%
proceedings
or

07:03:18.708 --> 07:03:18.718 align:start position:0%
or
 
07:03:18.718 --> 07:03:20.310 align:start position:0%
or
judiciary

07:03:20.310 --> 07:03:20.320 align:start position:0%
judiciary
 
07:03:22.230 --> 07:03:22.240 align:start position:0%
you know that
 
07:03:25.030 --> 07:03:25.040 align:start position:0%
other departments police
 
07:03:27.190 --> 07:03:27.200 align:start position:0%
could come and grab this
 
07:03:29.190 --> 07:03:29.200 align:start position:0%
and and you know that's not what new
 
07:03:32.868 --> 07:03:32.878 align:start position:0%
hampshire stands for
 
07:03:32.878 --> 07:03:35.030 align:start position:0%
hampshire stands for
well

07:03:35.030 --> 07:03:35.040 align:start position:0%
well
 
07:03:36.868 --> 07:03:36.878 align:start position:0%
my question to you is wouldn't them
 
07:03:39.030 --> 07:03:39.040 align:start position:0%
grabbing it need to be for a lawful
 
07:03:39.040 --> 07:03:40.230 align:start position:0%
grabbing it need to be for a lawful
purpose

07:03:40.230 --> 07:03:40.240 align:start position:0%
purpose
 
07:03:40.240 --> 07:03:41.030 align:start position:0%
purpose
and

07:03:41.030 --> 07:03:41.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:03:42.788 --> 07:03:42.798 align:start position:0%
if they cannot demonstrate a lawful
 
07:03:42.798 --> 07:03:43.750 align:start position:0%
if they cannot demonstrate a lawful
purpose

07:03:43.750 --> 07:03:43.760 align:start position:0%
purpose
 
07:03:45.350 --> 07:03:45.360 align:start position:0%
then i would i would agree with you that
 
07:03:47.270 --> 07:03:47.280 align:start position:0%
that would not be permitted under the
 
07:03:47.280 --> 07:03:50.150 align:start position:0%
that would not be permitted under the
law

07:03:50.150 --> 07:03:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:03:55.030 --> 07:03:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:03:57.510 --> 07:03:57.520 align:start position:0%
you know unlawful
 
07:04:00.548 --> 07:04:00.558 align:start position:0%
you know where is that in the the rsas
 
07:04:03.270 --> 07:04:03.280 align:start position:0%
what is lawful they could go in and say
 
07:04:06.150 --> 07:04:06.160 align:start position:0%
you know we just want this one footage
 
07:04:07.750 --> 07:04:07.760 align:start position:0%
because we believe
 
07:04:07.760 --> 07:04:09.430 align:start position:0%
because we believe
uh

07:04:09.430 --> 07:04:09.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
07:04:11.270 --> 07:04:11.280 align:start position:0%
representative welch drove down this
 
07:04:14.070 --> 07:04:14.080 align:start position:0%
road and he said he didn't
 
07:04:17.030 --> 07:04:17.040 align:start position:0%
so we want to grab that
 
07:04:18.628 --> 07:04:18.638 align:start position:0%
and that's not the
 
07:04:21.190 --> 07:04:21.200 align:start position:0%
in my eyes that's not the intent of this
 
07:04:21.200 --> 07:04:22.230 align:start position:0%
in my eyes that's not the intent of this
bill

07:04:22.230 --> 07:04:22.240 align:start position:0%
bill
 
07:04:25.670 --> 07:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
it's not to spy on us it is to help the
 
07:04:27.670 --> 07:04:27.680 align:start position:0%
public roads the bridges that we need to
 
07:04:27.680 --> 07:04:28.390 align:start position:0%
public roads the bridges that we need to
fix

07:04:28.390 --> 07:04:28.400 align:start position:0%
fix
 
07:04:30.548 --> 07:04:30.558 align:start position:0%
and to protect
 
07:04:33.910 --> 07:04:33.920 align:start position:0%
you know these accidents that do happen
 
07:04:33.920 --> 07:04:34.868 align:start position:0%
you know these accidents that do happen
um

07:04:34.868 --> 07:04:34.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:04:36.468 --> 07:04:36.478 align:start position:0%
you know to protect the scene and to
 
07:04:39.030 --> 07:04:39.040 align:start position:0%
protect you know what happened you know
 
07:04:40.310 --> 07:04:40.320 align:start position:0%
we're going to find out what's going to
 
07:04:42.468 --> 07:04:42.478 align:start position:0%
happen because of that footage and i
 
07:04:44.948 --> 07:04:44.958 align:start position:0%
support all that it's
 
07:04:47.350 --> 07:04:47.360 align:start position:0%
that three-day hold
 
07:04:49.830 --> 07:04:49.840 align:start position:0%
in if somebody grabs that which this
 
07:04:51.270 --> 07:04:51.280 align:start position:0%
says they can
 
07:04:53.270 --> 07:04:53.280 align:start position:0%
um what will they do with that through
 
07:04:56.948 --> 07:04:56.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:04:56.958 --> 07:04:58.310 align:start position:0%
 
question

07:04:58.310 --> 07:04:58.320 align:start position:0%
question
 
07:05:01.270 --> 07:05:01.280 align:start position:0%
representative testament
 
07:05:03.590 --> 07:05:03.600 align:start position:0%
the constitution clearly says
 
07:05:07.750 --> 07:05:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:05:11.110 --> 07:05:11.120 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't say for lawful purposes
 
07:05:12.788 --> 07:05:12.798 align:start position:0%
for unlawful purposes you say we have a
 
07:05:14.310 --> 07:05:14.320 align:start position:0%
right to privacy
 
07:05:14.320 --> 07:05:15.350 align:start position:0%
right to privacy
uh

07:05:15.350 --> 07:05:15.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
07:05:17.670 --> 07:05:17.680 align:start position:0%
i'm not even sure i like them having
 
07:05:19.110 --> 07:05:19.120 align:start position:0%
video cameras
 
07:05:20.708 --> 07:05:20.718 align:start position:0%
you know i think there's a violation of
 
07:05:22.948 --> 07:05:22.958 align:start position:0%
our privacy we keep saying well it's not
 
07:05:25.830 --> 07:05:25.840 align:start position:0%
much but you know
 
07:05:27.190 --> 07:05:27.200 align:start position:0%
you know
 
07:05:30.070 --> 07:05:30.080 align:start position:0%
the three days clearly is too much
 
07:05:32.468 --> 07:05:32.478 align:start position:0%
you know i think if if they drive if
 
07:05:34.548 --> 07:05:34.558 align:start position:0%
they can drive the truck home
 
07:05:36.708 --> 07:05:36.718 align:start position:0%
you know they don't need the video
 
07:05:39.910 --> 07:05:39.920 align:start position:0%
so just to clarify when we speak of
 
07:05:42.310 --> 07:05:42.320 align:start position:0%
expectations of privacy
 
07:05:44.628 --> 07:05:44.638 align:start position:0%
when these cameras
 
07:05:46.468 --> 07:05:46.478 align:start position:0%
these vehicles are
 
07:05:47.910 --> 07:05:47.920 align:start position:0%
in public
 
07:05:50.390 --> 07:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
it's on you when you're in public you're
 
07:05:52.150 --> 07:05:52.160 align:start position:0%
on a public road when representative
 
07:05:53.670 --> 07:05:53.680 align:start position:0%
welts is driving
 
07:05:56.390 --> 07:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
on whatever road
 
07:05:58.708 --> 07:05:58.718 align:start position:0%
route 93 whatever road it's a public
 
07:06:00.548 --> 07:06:00.558 align:start position:0%
road so to say you have an expectation
 
07:06:02.868 --> 07:06:02.878 align:start position:0%
of privacy when you're on a public road
 
07:06:04.948 --> 07:06:04.958 align:start position:0%
is inconsistent with the term privacy
 
07:06:07.350 --> 07:06:07.360 align:start position:0%
the expectation of privacy would be if
 
07:06:09.510 --> 07:06:09.520 align:start position:0%
they're filming inside your house
 
07:06:11.750 --> 07:06:11.760 align:start position:0%
that type of situation on private
 
07:06:13.190 --> 07:06:13.200 align:start position:0%
property if anyone shows up with a
 
07:06:14.948 --> 07:06:14.958 align:start position:0%
camera on your pr you tell them to turn
 
07:06:16.468 --> 07:06:16.478 align:start position:0%
that off if that makes you comfortable
 
07:06:19.270 --> 07:06:19.280 align:start position:0%
because it's your property i'm saying
 
07:06:21.030 --> 07:06:21.040 align:start position:0%
we're talking about when someone's in
 
07:06:21.040 --> 07:06:22.150 align:start position:0%
we're talking about when someone's in
public

07:06:22.150 --> 07:06:22.160 align:start position:0%
public
 
07:06:23.990 --> 07:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
all right and these accidents that we're
 
07:06:27.270 --> 07:06:27.280 align:start position:0%
hearing about is public property so
 
07:06:29.110 --> 07:06:29.120 align:start position:0%
i understand and i respect people's
 
07:06:30.708 --> 07:06:30.718 align:start position:0%
right to privacy
 
07:06:33.830 --> 07:06:33.840 align:start position:0%
this is not this is not violating that
 
07:06:34.948 --> 07:06:34.958 align:start position:0%
because it's
 
07:06:36.310 --> 07:06:36.320 align:start position:0%
has to do
 
07:06:38.548 --> 07:06:38.558 align:start position:0%
with when they're on public property so
 
07:06:40.628 --> 07:06:40.638 align:start position:0%
i i'm just confused by
 
07:06:42.390 --> 07:06:42.400 align:start position:0%
i understand that the concern about this
 
07:06:44.548 --> 07:06:44.558 align:start position:0%
video being misused
 
07:06:46.390 --> 07:06:46.400 align:start position:0%
just understand you are in
 
07:06:47.990 --> 07:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
in a public place and if someone's
 
07:06:49.190 --> 07:06:49.200 align:start position:0%
recording you
 
07:06:51.910 --> 07:06:51.920 align:start position:0%
government or a private person
 
07:06:53.350 --> 07:06:53.360 align:start position:0%
how can you say you have an expectation
 
07:06:58.230 --> 07:06:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:06:59.510 --> 07:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
i'll let representative rhodes speak to
 
07:07:00.830 --> 07:07:00.840 align:start position:0%
him represent burger you can
 
07:07:03.830 --> 07:07:03.840 align:start position:0%
respond thank you mr chairman i i would
 
07:07:06.230 --> 07:07:06.240 align:start position:0%
like to point out that
 
07:07:09.030 --> 07:07:09.040 align:start position:0%
a tesla vehicle has
 
07:07:12.390 --> 07:07:12.400 align:start position:0%
cameras on the on their doors
 
07:07:14.070 --> 07:07:14.080 align:start position:0%
so when you're driving on the road and
 
07:07:17.190 --> 07:07:17.200 align:start position:0%
you pass a tesla you've been recorded
 
07:07:18.708 --> 07:07:18.718 align:start position:0%
whether you guys realize that or not you
 
07:07:19.910 --> 07:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
have been
 
07:07:22.070 --> 07:07:22.080 align:start position:0%
and i think also
 
07:07:24.548 --> 07:07:24.558 align:start position:0%
this might come out really wrong
 
07:07:27.270 --> 07:07:27.280 align:start position:0%
god knows i'm famous for that
 
07:07:28.628 --> 07:07:28.638 align:start position:0%
sometimes you have to give up the right
 
07:07:31.110 --> 07:07:31.120 align:start position:0%
to be right i i think that
 
07:07:32.948 --> 07:07:32.958 align:start position:0%
people are looking for this to say
 
07:07:35.750 --> 07:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
something that it does not say
 
07:07:38.390 --> 07:07:38.400 align:start position:0%
and are looking at for it to try to
 
07:07:40.390 --> 07:07:40.400 align:start position:0%
accomplish something that it's
 
07:07:41.670 --> 07:07:41.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't say that it's going to
 
07:07:41.680 --> 07:07:44.070 align:start position:0%
doesn't say that it's going to
accomplish

07:07:44.070 --> 07:07:44.080 align:start position:0%
accomplish
 
07:07:48.070 --> 07:07:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
07:07:50.310 --> 07:07:50.320 align:start position:0%
the constitution says it could be the
 
07:07:52.628 --> 07:07:52.638 align:start position:0%
right for privacy individuals right to
 
07:07:54.868 --> 07:07:54.878 align:start position:0%
live free from governmental intrusion
 
07:07:57.030 --> 07:07:57.040 align:start position:0%
and private or personal information is
 
07:07:59.830 --> 07:07:59.840 align:start position:0%
natural essentially inherent i don't see
 
07:08:03.430 --> 07:08:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:08:05.430 --> 07:08:05.440 align:start position:0%
that license plate on your vehicle that
 
07:08:07.750 --> 07:08:07.760 align:start position:0%
they can see no no well that's what i
 
07:08:09.510 --> 07:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
was going to say was
 
07:08:11.190 --> 07:08:11.200 align:start position:0%
the tesla
 
07:08:13.510 --> 07:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
right john burt driving down the road
 
07:08:15.510 --> 07:08:15.520 align:start position:0%
getting your license plate that's all
 
07:08:15.520 --> 07:08:17.190 align:start position:0%
getting your license plate that's all
private

07:08:17.190 --> 07:08:17.200 align:start position:0%
private
 
07:08:21.030 --> 07:08:21.040 align:start position:0%
it says the supreme court has ruled that
 
07:08:24.548 --> 07:08:24.558 align:start position:0%
the government cannot spy on us
 
07:08:24.558 --> 07:08:25.510 align:start position:0%
the government cannot spy on us
in

07:08:25.510 --> 07:08:25.520 align:start position:0%
in
 
07:08:26.468 --> 07:08:26.478 align:start position:0%
you know and
 
07:08:28.948 --> 07:08:28.958 align:start position:0%
you know i don't go you know
 
07:08:31.110 --> 07:08:31.120 align:start position:0%
you know so when i say that you know i i
 
07:08:32.788 --> 07:08:32.798 align:start position:0%
like the dash cam
 
07:08:34.868 --> 07:08:34.878 align:start position:0%
and it's only going to be used for that
 
07:08:37.430 --> 07:08:37.440 align:start position:0%
specific reason is for crash or
 
07:08:40.548 --> 07:08:40.558 align:start position:0%
or a crime around it um you know i guess
 
07:08:42.150 --> 07:08:42.160 align:start position:0%
i'd even you know have to look at that
 
07:08:43.990 --> 07:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
but the supreme court has been very
 
07:08:44.000 --> 07:08:45.990 align:start position:0%
but the supreme court has been very
clear

07:08:45.990 --> 07:08:46.000 align:start position:0%
clear
 
07:08:47.910 --> 07:08:47.920 align:start position:0%
i can stand on the side of the road and
 
07:08:50.788 --> 07:08:50.798 align:start position:0%
videotape anybody i want in pro in
 
07:08:50.798 --> 07:08:52.310 align:start position:0%
videotape anybody i want in pro in
public

07:08:52.310 --> 07:08:52.320 align:start position:0%
public
 
07:08:56.150 --> 07:08:56.160 align:start position:0%
the government can't we don't have
 
07:08:56.160 --> 07:08:57.590 align:start position:0%
the government can't we don't have
um

07:08:57.590 --> 07:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:08:59.190 --> 07:08:59.200 align:start position:0%
red light
 
07:09:02.548 --> 07:09:02.558 align:start position:0%
cameras for a reason
 
07:09:05.190 --> 07:09:05.200 align:start position:0%
because we've all both sides have always
 
07:09:07.430 --> 07:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
voted those down because we don't want
 
07:09:09.510 --> 07:09:09.520 align:start position:0%
to be spied on by the government we
 
07:09:12.230 --> 07:09:12.240 align:start position:0%
passed a constitutional amendment which
 
07:09:13.510 --> 07:09:13.520 align:start position:0%
is huge
 
07:09:16.310 --> 07:09:16.320 align:start position:0%
because we don't want to be spied on
 
07:09:18.868 --> 07:09:18.878 align:start position:0%
and for somebody to go in a you know
 
07:09:21.110 --> 07:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
department a government department to
 
07:09:22.788 --> 07:09:22.798 align:start position:0%
grab this video
 
07:09:25.270 --> 07:09:25.280 align:start position:0%
i can't do it
 
07:09:26.150 --> 07:09:26.160 align:start position:0%
if i
 
07:09:28.150 --> 07:09:28.160 align:start position:0%
so how would you let me just ask this
 
07:09:29.910 --> 07:09:29.920 align:start position:0%
how exactly
 
07:09:31.510 --> 07:09:31.520 align:start position:0%
how much time do you want them to have
 
07:09:33.110 --> 07:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
to be able to hold the video because if
 
07:09:35.350 --> 07:09:35.360 align:start position:0%
you're not restoring if you record
 
07:09:37.430 --> 07:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
something and you don't store it all it
 
07:09:39.510 --> 07:09:39.520 align:start position:0%
is is just a live feed
 
07:09:42.310 --> 07:09:42.320 align:start position:0%
so it has to be recorded and stored for
 
07:09:44.628 --> 07:09:44.638 align:start position:0%
some period of time in order to make the
 
07:09:46.788 --> 07:09:46.798 align:start position:0%
determination whether that
 
07:09:48.390 --> 07:09:48.400 align:start position:0%
that recording
 
07:09:48.400 --> 07:09:49.270 align:start position:0%
that recording
is

07:09:49.270 --> 07:09:49.280 align:start position:0%
is
 
07:09:50.788 --> 07:09:50.798 align:start position:0%
you know there's a crash or if there's
 
07:09:52.390 --> 07:09:52.400 align:start position:0%
whatever those examples there needs to
 
07:09:54.868 --> 07:09:54.878 align:start position:0%
be a certain period of time that they
 
07:09:56.548 --> 07:09:56.558 align:start position:0%
need to figure okay we gotta now
 
07:09:58.788 --> 07:09:58.798 align:start position:0%
maintain this footage
 
07:10:01.270 --> 07:10:01.280 align:start position:0%
i'm saying if three days is too long if
 
07:10:02.788 --> 07:10:02.798 align:start position:0%
we change that to two days would that
 
07:10:04.868 --> 07:10:04.878 align:start position:0%
change anyone's mind here i'm just at
 
07:10:05.990 --> 07:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
some point
 
07:10:08.230 --> 07:10:08.240 align:start position:0%
it i'm not really sure what we're
 
07:10:09.990 --> 07:10:10.000 align:start position:0%
talking about it's not an invasion of
 
07:10:12.390 --> 07:10:12.400 align:start position:0%
privacy if it's stored for three days
 
07:10:14.150 --> 07:10:14.160 align:start position:0%
or sorry if it's stored for one day or
 
07:10:15.750 --> 07:10:15.760 align:start position:0%
two days but it is if it's stored for
 
07:10:17.510 --> 07:10:17.520 align:start position:0%
three days because we're worried about
 
07:10:19.510 --> 07:10:19.520 align:start position:0%
someone somehow accessing a computer
 
07:10:19.520 --> 07:10:20.788 align:start position:0%
someone somehow accessing a computer
system

07:10:20.788 --> 07:10:20.798 align:start position:0%
system
 
07:10:22.230 --> 07:10:22.240 align:start position:0%
and keep in mind someone who works
 
07:10:23.750 --> 07:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to assist them in doing
 
07:10:24.868 --> 07:10:24.878 align:start position:0%
that because
 
07:10:25.990 --> 07:10:26.000 align:start position:0%
they're going to have to work for the
 
07:10:27.830 --> 07:10:27.840 align:start position:0%
department to give them the video
 
07:10:29.430 --> 07:10:29.440 align:start position:0%
and they're not going to provide any
 
07:10:31.030 --> 07:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
explanation why
 
07:10:32.070 --> 07:10:32.080 align:start position:0%
they need the video that he's going to
 
07:10:33.350 --> 07:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
give it away
 
07:10:35.750 --> 07:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
and for what's what's happening here a
 
07:10:38.628 --> 07:10:38.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:10:40.948 --> 07:10:40.958 align:start position:0%
you know what we're all feel good is if
 
07:10:43.430 --> 07:10:43.440 align:start position:0%
it excludes any
 
07:10:47.030 --> 07:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
recording being used uh being released
 
07:10:48.788 --> 07:10:48.798 align:start position:0%
you know if it says that it cannot be
 
07:10:48.798 --> 07:10:49.990 align:start position:0%
you know if it says that it cannot be
released

07:10:49.990 --> 07:10:50.000 align:start position:0%
released
 
07:10:53.270 --> 07:10:53.280 align:start position:0%
because the only purpose for this is
 
07:10:53.280 --> 07:10:54.948 align:start position:0%
because the only purpose for this is
accidents

07:10:54.948 --> 07:10:54.958 align:start position:0%
accidents
 
07:10:56.868 --> 07:10:56.878 align:start position:0%
around this vehicle
 
07:10:58.230 --> 07:10:58.240 align:start position:0%
because that's the intent that's what
 
07:11:00.310 --> 07:11:00.320 align:start position:0%
the gentleman said you know we want this
 
07:11:00.320 --> 07:11:01.830 align:start position:0%
the gentleman said you know we want this
camera

07:11:01.830 --> 07:11:01.840 align:start position:0%
camera
 
07:11:04.310 --> 07:11:04.320 align:start position:0%
in case our car get our state car gets
 
07:11:04.320 --> 07:11:06.150 align:start position:0%
in case our car get our state car gets
hit

07:11:06.150 --> 07:11:06.160 align:start position:0%
hit
 
07:11:07.750 --> 07:11:07.760 align:start position:0%
you know and he says that's the only
 
07:11:09.270 --> 07:11:09.280 align:start position:0%
reason we want it or for training
 
07:11:11.510 --> 07:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
purposes which i disagree with that one
 
07:11:12.868 --> 07:11:12.878 align:start position:0%
but you know so if you wanted to make an
 
07:11:14.788 --> 07:11:14.798 align:start position:0%
amendment saying that there's no release
 
07:11:17.110 --> 07:11:17.120 align:start position:0%
of this video and after three days
 
07:11:19.910 --> 07:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
the videos cleared i would support it
 
07:11:21.350 --> 07:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
because i support everything else in
 
07:11:23.990 --> 07:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
this bill it's the privacy part because
 
07:11:26.468 --> 07:11:26.478 align:start position:0%
we've worked too hard to get where new
 
07:11:29.510 --> 07:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire is to protect the privacy
 
07:11:31.430 --> 07:11:31.440 align:start position:0%
and that's from both sides both sides
 
07:11:33.350 --> 07:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
have worked hard for this
 
07:11:33.360 --> 07:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
have worked hard for this
and

07:11:36.000 --> 07:11:36.010 align:start position:0%
 
07:11:36.010 --> 07:11:38.788 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

07:11:38.788 --> 07:11:38.798 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
07:11:41.990 --> 07:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
mr chairman our our cars
 
07:11:44.468 --> 07:11:44.478 align:start position:0%
classed as government cars
 
07:11:47.510 --> 07:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:11:49.270 --> 07:11:49.280 align:start position:0%
yes and normally they're distinctly
 
07:11:51.910 --> 07:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
marked even if they're not
 
07:11:53.990 --> 07:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
07:11:56.468 --> 07:11:56.478 align:start position:0%
my question would be to representative
 
07:11:56.478 --> 07:11:58.070 align:start position:0%
my question would be to representative
burke

07:11:58.070 --> 07:11:58.080 align:start position:0%
burke
 
07:12:01.510 --> 07:12:01.520 align:start position:0%
did you say you had a cam
 
07:12:02.868 --> 07:12:02.878 align:start position:0%
in your car
 
07:12:06.150 --> 07:12:06.160 align:start position:0%
do you have our plates on it
 
07:12:08.150 --> 07:12:08.160 align:start position:0%
wouldn't you say that you were invading
 
07:12:21.830 --> 07:12:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:12:24.788 --> 07:12:24.798 align:start position:0%
but i'm just saying you are saying this
 
07:12:26.070 --> 07:12:26.080 align:start position:0%
about a
 
07:12:29.190 --> 07:12:29.200 align:start position:0%
vehicle that would be taking pictures of
 
07:12:31.030 --> 07:12:31.040 align:start position:0%
a car accident
 
07:12:34.070 --> 07:12:34.080 align:start position:0%
that could go back to the person
 
07:12:34.080 --> 07:12:35.190 align:start position:0%
that could go back to the person
that

07:12:35.190 --> 07:12:35.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:12:37.190 --> 07:12:37.200 align:start position:0%
might not have the evidence that they
 
07:12:37.200 --> 07:12:39.190 align:start position:0%
might not have the evidence that they
need

07:12:39.190 --> 07:12:39.200 align:start position:0%
need
 
07:12:41.910 --> 07:12:41.920 align:start position:0%
and they're a government vehicle but so
 
07:12:44.628 --> 07:12:44.638 align:start position:0%
are ours but why wouldn't that be all
 
07:12:44.638 --> 07:12:45.670 align:start position:0%
are ours but why wouldn't that be all
right

07:12:45.670 --> 07:12:45.680 align:start position:0%
right
 
07:12:50.070 --> 07:12:50.080 align:start position:0%
i support that part i support if if the
 
07:12:52.628 --> 07:12:52.638 align:start position:0%
state truck caught an accident or was in
 
07:12:54.150 --> 07:12:54.160 align:start position:0%
an accident you know he's picking up
 
07:12:55.830 --> 07:12:55.840 align:start position:0%
trash on the side of the road and in
 
07:12:57.990 --> 07:12:58.000 align:start position:0%
some tractor trailer or a car or a
 
07:13:01.270 --> 07:13:01.280 align:start position:0%
camper somebody cleans him out the car
 
07:13:03.510 --> 07:13:03.520 align:start position:0%
i want that footage so i support that
 
07:13:07.190 --> 07:13:07.200 align:start position:0%
part it is the possibility of the police
 
07:13:09.030 --> 07:13:09.040 align:start position:0%
going in or someone else going in
 
07:13:10.788 --> 07:13:10.798 align:start position:0%
another government agency which is
 
07:13:12.548 --> 07:13:12.558 align:start position:0%
against the constitution and grabbing
 
07:13:14.948 --> 07:13:14.958 align:start position:0%
that video the supreme court's been very
 
07:13:16.230 --> 07:13:16.240 align:start position:0%
clear on it
 
07:13:18.788 --> 07:13:18.798 align:start position:0%
they can't do it or they shouldn't do it
 
07:13:20.628 --> 07:13:20.638 align:start position:0%
representative burke but when would the
 
07:13:22.390 --> 07:13:22.400 align:start position:0%
you hit the record button there's just
 
07:13:24.230 --> 07:13:24.240 align:start position:0%
been an accident someone needs to be
 
07:13:26.868 --> 07:13:26.878 align:start position:0%
start the recording no record 20 record
 
07:13:28.708 --> 07:13:28.718 align:start position:0%
24 hours
 
07:13:31.750 --> 07:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
the video is not allowed to leave
 
07:13:33.990 --> 07:13:34.000 align:start position:0%
if there's an accident then the video is
 
07:13:36.788 --> 07:13:36.798 align:start position:0%
to be used at the end of the day or the
 
07:13:38.788 --> 07:13:38.798 align:start position:0%
end of three days if there's no
 
07:13:41.270 --> 07:13:41.280 align:start position:0%
accidents in those three days nobody can
 
07:13:44.230 --> 07:13:44.240 align:start position:0%
grab that video just like the um tolls
 
07:13:46.708 --> 07:13:46.718 align:start position:0%
nobody can grab those plates
 
07:13:48.548 --> 07:13:48.558 align:start position:0%
in the tolls
 
07:13:50.708 --> 07:13:50.718 align:start position:0%
i can't go to easy pass and say you know
 
07:13:52.150 --> 07:13:52.160 align:start position:0%
i want to see every car that goes
 
07:13:53.270 --> 07:13:53.280 align:start position:0%
through because i want to know if
 
07:13:54.788 --> 07:13:54.798 align:start position:0%
representative welch went through the
 
07:13:55.910 --> 07:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
toll today
 
07:13:57.590 --> 07:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
i i can't do it
 
07:14:00.548 --> 07:14:00.558 align:start position:0%
i just i just think that uh there was no
 
07:14:03.910 --> 07:14:03.920 align:start position:0%
video cameras when the constitution was
 
07:14:07.030 --> 07:14:07.040 align:start position:0%
written yes so we have to start some
 
07:14:09.110 --> 07:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
presidents someplace well but the
 
07:14:12.310 --> 07:14:12.320 align:start position:0%
constitution is very clear on privacy
 
07:14:15.670 --> 07:14:15.680 align:start position:0%
it says government shall not
 
07:14:19.510 --> 07:14:19.520 align:start position:0%
uh surveil the government or the public
 
07:14:21.270 --> 07:14:21.280 align:start position:0%
in in back when the constitution was
 
07:14:23.110 --> 07:14:23.120 align:start position:0%
written that means there won't be a
 
07:14:24.948 --> 07:14:24.958 align:start position:0%
policeman on every corner with
 
07:14:27.110 --> 07:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
binoculars going okay who's coming down
 
07:14:29.350 --> 07:14:29.360 align:start position:0%
and make a log of it would you believe
 
07:14:30.868 --> 07:14:30.878 align:start position:0%
mr burke
 
07:14:33.030 --> 07:14:33.040 align:start position:0%
representative burke there was no police
 
07:14:35.750 --> 07:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
officers at that time that's true yes
 
07:14:37.590 --> 07:14:37.600 align:start position:0%
back in the good days
 
07:14:39.350 --> 07:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
when we didn't need them all right let
 
07:14:41.190 --> 07:14:41.200 align:start position:0%
let's let some representative marston is
 
07:14:41.200 --> 07:14:42.230 align:start position:0%
let's let some representative marston is
not

07:14:42.230 --> 07:14:42.240 align:start position:0%
not
 
07:14:45.990 --> 07:14:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:14:48.070 --> 07:14:48.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
07:14:50.868 --> 07:14:50.878 align:start position:0%
if i understand my fellow representative
 
07:14:53.670 --> 07:14:53.680 align:start position:0%
bert saying that it's illegal and it's
 
07:14:56.070 --> 07:14:56.080 align:start position:0%
based on a supreme court ruling
 
07:14:58.390 --> 07:14:58.400 align:start position:0%
then if somebody went in and grabbed it
 
07:15:01.350 --> 07:15:01.360 align:start position:0%
it would not be admissible in court and
 
07:15:03.590 --> 07:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
would get thrown out based on the
 
07:15:06.150 --> 07:15:06.160 align:start position:0%
supreme court's ruling so it becomes a
 
07:15:10.788 --> 07:15:10.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:15:12.468 --> 07:15:12.478 align:start position:0%
representative morrison that as well put
 
07:15:15.830 --> 07:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
it in a legal government recording
 
07:15:17.670 --> 07:15:17.680 align:start position:0%
uh would be
 
07:15:20.150 --> 07:15:20.160 align:start position:0%
it would be suppressed
 
07:15:21.590 --> 07:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:15:23.110 --> 07:15:23.120 align:start position:0%

and it happened during the testimony
here

07:15:31.990 --> 07:15:32.000 align:start position:0%
here
 
07:15:33.830 --> 07:15:33.840 align:start position:0%
that they are putting cameras up on the
 
07:15:36.310 --> 07:15:36.320 align:start position:0%
poles on the highways and i've counted
 
07:15:41.190 --> 07:15:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:15:43.030 --> 07:15:43.040 align:start position:0%
it's camera
 
07:15:44.868 --> 07:15:44.878 align:start position:0%
surveilling the public
 
07:15:48.230 --> 07:15:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:15:51.510 --> 07:15:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:15:55.030 --> 07:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
we'll now move the question
 
07:15:55.040 --> 07:15:55.910 align:start position:0%
we'll now move the question
oh

07:15:55.910 --> 07:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
oh
 
07:15:58.628 --> 07:15:58.638 align:start position:0%
represent walls i apologize thank you mr
 
07:16:00.788 --> 07:16:00.798 align:start position:0%
chairman actually there are the majority
 
07:16:02.628 --> 07:16:02.638 align:start position:0%
of all motor vehicles manufactured after
 
07:16:05.910 --> 07:16:05.920 align:start position:0%
2016 have at least
 
07:16:07.830 --> 07:16:07.840 align:start position:0%
two or three sometimes 10 cameras in
 
07:16:11.270 --> 07:16:11.280 align:start position:0%
them including suvs tahoes pickup trucks
 
07:16:13.990 --> 07:16:14.000 align:start position:0%
uh even bmw motorcycles all have the
 
07:16:15.430 --> 07:16:15.440 align:start position:0%
cameras so
 
07:16:17.990 --> 07:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
presume you're being recorded you are
 
07:16:23.030 --> 07:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
this is 1984 on steroids
 
07:16:24.548 --> 07:16:24.558 align:start position:0%
this time
 
07:16:26.390 --> 07:16:26.400 align:start position:0%
representative pratt you recognized
 
07:16:27.830 --> 07:16:27.840 align:start position:0%
i just had one concern and i'm pretty
 
07:16:28.868 --> 07:16:28.878 align:start position:0%
sure it's gonna get caught in the
 
07:16:31.270 --> 07:16:31.280 align:start position:0%
finance committee but um
 
07:16:32.948 --> 07:16:32.958 align:start position:0%
they're talking about a million dollars
 
07:16:32.958 --> 07:16:33.750 align:start position:0%
they're talking about a million dollars
for

07:16:33.750 --> 07:16:33.760 align:start position:0%
for
 
07:16:35.830 --> 07:16:35.840 align:start position:0%
body cams police officers and 30 million
 
07:16:38.468 --> 07:16:38.478 align:start position:0%
dollars for dwr department of
 
07:16:40.070 --> 07:16:40.080 align:start position:0%
transportation vehicles
 
07:16:42.868 --> 07:16:42.878 align:start position:0%
i think the priority is backwards there
 
07:16:44.628 --> 07:16:44.638 align:start position:0%
by quite a bit but i think that'll be
 
07:16:46.548 --> 07:16:46.558 align:start position:0%
caught in finance so i'm still going to
 
07:16:48.868 --> 07:16:48.878 align:start position:0%
vote yes for it
 
07:16:51.670 --> 07:16:51.680 align:start position:0%
even though i could say
 
07:16:52.948 --> 07:16:52.958 align:start position:0%
at this time we will now move the
 
07:16:54.390 --> 07:16:54.400 align:start position:0%
