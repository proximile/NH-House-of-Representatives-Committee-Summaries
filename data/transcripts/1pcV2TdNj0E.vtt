okay so
 
00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:55.139 align:start position:0%
um I always say that every session is um
 
00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 align:start position:0%
another chapter in my book
 
00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.560 align:start position:0%
and and uh meeting in this room I can
 
00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 align:start position:0%
now add this chapter has something very
 
00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 align:start position:0%
unique is I get to not only
 
00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 align:start position:0%
sit in the speaker's chair but I now can
 
00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:13.139 align:start position:0%
see in this uh Infamous committee room
 
00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:15.540 align:start position:0%
which is the finance committee room in
 
00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:17.040 align:start position:0%
which uh
 
00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060 align:start position:0%
um so much happens occurs here so this
 
00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:22.610 align:start position:0%
um so much happens occurs here so this
uh

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:22.620 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:24.800 align:start position:0%
but it's a big room isn't it
 
00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:30.600 align:start position:0%
um we'll introduce Amelia garaldi from
 
00:05:32.689 --> 00:05:32.699 align:start position:0%
the bank commissioner
 
00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:36.840 align:start position:0%
and who will introduce the bill and the
 
00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:46.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:50.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:53.629 --> 00:05:53.639 align:start position:0%
uh so good morning for the record my
 
00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
name is Amelia galderi I'm the bank
 
00:05:56.689 --> 00:05:56.699 align:start position:0%
commissioner for the State of New
 
00:05:58.370 --> 00:05:58.380 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh thank you for this
 
00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:00.419 align:start position:0%
opportunity to provide information about
 
00:06:02.689 --> 00:06:02.699 align:start position:0%
house bill 520.
 
00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:05.880 align:start position:0%
um House Bill 520 was drafted at the
 
00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:07.560 align:start position:0%
request of the New Hampshire banking
 
00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:10.620 align:start position:0%
Department it started out as a technical
 
00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:12.720 align:start position:0%
fix so
 
00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:15.600 align:start position:0%
um about two years ago the legislature
 
00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:16.919 align:start position:0%
um again at the request of the banking
 
00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:19.139 align:start position:0%
Department working with industry
 
00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:21.600 align:start position:0%
um made a change to how
 
00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:24.600 align:start position:0%
um the interest rate for escrow accounts
 
00:06:26.689 --> 00:06:26.699 align:start position:0%
is calculated so if you have a mortgage
 
00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:29.460 align:start position:0%
and you have an escrow account the bank
 
00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:32.160 align:start position:0%
or lending institution might be holding
 
00:06:34.189 --> 00:06:34.199 align:start position:0%
an amount in escrow to pay for your more
 
00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:38.580 align:start position:0%
your homeowners insurance your taxes Etc
 
00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:42.600 align:start position:0%
um and the banking Department set the
 
00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:45.780 align:start position:0%
interest rate on that account so the way
 
00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:47.460 align:start position:0%
we used to set it is we would do this
 
00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:49.340 align:start position:0%
kind of administratively burdensome
 
00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:52.380 align:start position:0%
request of our chartered entities to
 
00:06:53.809 --> 00:06:53.819 align:start position:0%
find out how much they're paying on
 
00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:56.280 align:start position:0%
deposit accounts we would tally that all
 
00:06:58.730 --> 00:06:58.740 align:start position:0%
up subtract one and that would be the
 
00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:00.900 align:start position:0%
interest rate and because that was
 
00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:03.120 align:start position:0%
burdensome on us to gather that
 
00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:04.500 align:start position:0%
information burst them on the entities
 
00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:06.840 align:start position:0%
that we regulated we worked with the
 
00:07:10.309 --> 00:07:10.319 align:start position:0%
industry to change that and we attempted
 
00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:14.400 align:start position:0%
to tie it to the FED funds index at the
 
00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:16.800 align:start position:0%
time it was Zero it seemed like an easy
 
00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:18.050 align:start position:0%
time it was Zero it seemed like an easy
solution

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:18.060 align:start position:0%
solution
 
00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:21.240 align:start position:0%
less administrative burden good
 
00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:24.780 align:start position:0%
um however we realized about six months
 
00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:27.000 align:start position:0%
after that legislation was passed that
 
00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
there was a cross-reference to that law
 
00:07:31.969 --> 00:07:31.979 align:start position:0%
in our Mortgage Bankers and Brokers
 
00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:35.280 align:start position:0%
statute yep so um and we had missed that
 
00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:38.400 align:start position:0%
cross-reference so then even though the
 
00:07:40.189 --> 00:07:40.199 align:start position:0%
banks were going forward with the new
 
00:07:41.689 --> 00:07:41.699 align:start position:0%
calculation we still had to do the old
 
00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:43.860 align:start position:0%
calculation for the Mortgage Bankers so
 
00:07:46.189 --> 00:07:46.199 align:start position:0%
this bill as it's currently drafted was
 
00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:50.220 align:start position:0%
meant to fix that and make them the same
 
00:07:53.749 --> 00:07:53.759 align:start position:0%
um after we saw uh as this excuse me as
 
00:07:57.050 --> 00:07:57.060 align:start position:0%
this uh progressed we um heard from the
 
00:07:59.210 --> 00:07:59.220 align:start position:0%
bankers Association in particular but
 
00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:00.589 align:start position:0%
bankers Association in particular but
that

00:08:00.589 --> 00:08:00.599 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:08:04.129 --> 00:08:04.139 align:start position:0%
um they because the FED fed funds the
 
00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:06.660 align:start position:0%
has been the FED funds rate has been
 
00:08:08.089 --> 00:08:08.099 align:start position:0%
increasing obviously as we're all aware
 
00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:09.720 align:start position:0%
in the news
 
00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:11.400 align:start position:0%
um and it was becoming somewhat
 
00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:13.560 align:start position:0%
unmanageable even from a logistical
 
00:08:14.689 --> 00:08:14.699 align:start position:0%
standpoint because it was always
 
00:08:16.309 --> 00:08:16.319 align:start position:0%
changing they would have to go and back
 
00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:18.240 align:start position:0%
date and it was a moving Target
 
00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:20.270 align:start position:0%
date and it was a moving Target
basically

00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:20.280 align:start position:0%
basically
 
00:08:22.969 --> 00:08:22.979 align:start position:0%
so we worked with the bankers to come up
 
00:08:22.979 --> 00:08:24.110 align:start position:0%
so we worked with the bankers to come up
with

00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:24.120 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:26.580 align:start position:0%
um the amendment that's been circulated
 
00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:29.460 align:start position:0%
that um effectively
 
00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
one ties it to a new rate a new index
 
00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
set by the FDIC on
 
00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:38.580 align:start position:0%
um the national deposit rate for savings
 
00:08:41.089 --> 00:08:41.099 align:start position:0%
accounts that's published by the FDIC so
 
00:08:42.829 --> 00:08:42.839 align:start position:0%
we liked it because it was tied to an
 
00:08:43.969 --> 00:08:43.979 align:start position:0%
index so we don't have to do the
 
00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:46.920 align:start position:0%
administrative burden additionally
 
00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:48.540 align:start position:0%
um this amendment
 
00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:49.310 align:start position:0%
um this amendment
um

00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:49.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:51.949 --> 00:08:51.959 align:start position:0%
sets the rate every six months
 
00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:53.940 align:start position:0%
so that takes away the moving Target
 
00:08:57.050 --> 00:08:57.060 align:start position:0%
aspect of it and then we also requested
 
00:08:59.690 --> 00:08:59.700 align:start position:0%
there be a floor in a ceiling so that
 
00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:03.000 align:start position:0%
there's a minimum of 0.5 percent per
 
00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:04.200 align:start position:0%
year that would be the minimum interest
 
00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:07.140 align:start position:0%
rate and then there's a a cap of um I'm
 
00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:09.300 align:start position:0%
sorry point zero five percent is the
 
00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:12.600 align:start position:0%
floor 0.5 percent is the cap
 
00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:13.190 align:start position:0%
floor 0.5 percent is the cap
um

00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:13.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:15.660 align:start position:0%
for the interest rate that would be
 
00:09:18.769 --> 00:09:18.779 align:start position:0%
applied to this the escrow accounts and
 
00:09:20.389 --> 00:09:20.399 align:start position:0%
then additionally you'll notice there's
 
00:09:21.949 --> 00:09:21.959 align:start position:0%
two sections because we caught at this
 
00:09:26.449 --> 00:09:26.459 align:start position:0%
time there's the RSA 397a change which
 
00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:30.240 align:start position:0%
mirrors the RSA 383b so those two are
 
00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:31.980 align:start position:0%
effectively the same just one governs
 
00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:34.740 align:start position:0%
mortgage companies and the other governs
 
00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:37.070 align:start position:0%
mortgage companies and the other governs
Banks

00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:37.080 align:start position:0%
Banks
 
00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:39.720 align:start position:0%
so that's all that's the explanation for
 
00:09:41.389 --> 00:09:41.399 align:start position:0%
what's in front of you and I'm happy to
 
00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:43.500 align:start position:0%
answer any questions
 
00:09:45.949 --> 00:09:45.959 align:start position:0%
um that you may have
 
00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:49.200 align:start position:0%
okay representative magular I just have
 
00:09:51.829 --> 00:09:51.839 align:start position:0%
one question and in the original bill
 
00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:54.320 align:start position:0%
you were using the the overnight rate
 
00:09:56.329 --> 00:09:56.339 align:start position:0%
and and now
 
00:09:58.490 --> 00:09:58.500 align:start position:0%
um this rate this rate is likely to be
 
00:10:00.889 --> 00:10:00.899 align:start position:0%
higher than the overnight rate isn't it
 
00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:03.240 align:start position:0%
I don't think this rate I think is
 
00:10:05.389 --> 00:10:05.399 align:start position:0%
currently lower than the credit funds
 
00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:06.740 align:start position:0%
index okay thank you
 
00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:08.389 align:start position:0%
index okay thank you
[Music]

00:10:08.389 --> 00:10:08.399 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:10.740 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:12.660 align:start position:0%
my only question is
 
00:10:15.889 --> 00:10:15.899 align:start position:0%
um this is not a and it's not stamped
 
00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:17.820 align:start position:0%
unapproved amendments yeah this is yeah
 
00:10:20.269 --> 00:10:20.279 align:start position:0%
this is from her so we would take this
 
00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:22.200 align:start position:0%
over to legislative services and have a
 
00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:23.820 align:start position:0%
full Amendment drawn up okay and it
 
00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:25.740 align:start position:0%
replaces take it up in subcommittee okay
 
00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:27.480 align:start position:0%
and then approve it all right but it
 
00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:29.100 align:start position:0%
didn't it didn't make sense to discuss
 
00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:31.320 align:start position:0%
the bill in its current uniform when
 
00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
there was already a proposed amendment
 
00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:10:36.889 --> 00:10:36.899 align:start position:0%
any other questions oh representative
 
00:10:36.899 --> 00:10:40.910 align:start position:0%
any other questions oh representative
Herbert

00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:45.000 align:start position:0%
uh you're going to use the FDIC
 
00:10:48.170 --> 00:10:48.180 align:start position:0%
for which is updated every six months I
 
00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:50.160 align:start position:0%
think you said it's updated more often
 
00:10:52.490 --> 00:10:52.500 align:start position:0%
than that but we set two dates in time
 
00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:56.160 align:start position:0%
to to tie it to so what I uh so
 
00:10:58.190 --> 00:10:58.200 align:start position:0%
basically whatever
 
00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:01.740 align:start position:0%
the fed the I'm sorry the rate is on
 
00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:05.880 align:start position:0%
October 1st will be oh no I'm sorry July
 
00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:07.860 align:start position:0%
so it gets published in July
 
00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
October 1st it gets set and then it gets
 
00:11:12.829 --> 00:11:12.839 align:start position:0%
published in January and April it gets
 
00:11:15.769 --> 00:11:15.779 align:start position:0%
set based on the January rate okay so we
 
00:11:17.389 --> 00:11:17.399 align:start position:0%
tied it to a point in time to make it
 
00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:19.560 align:start position:0%
administratively easier to for the banks
 
00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:21.720 align:start position:0%
to apply I get that I just was I was
 
00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
just trying to figure out exactly what
 
00:11:27.829 --> 00:11:27.839 align:start position:0%
that FDIC rate was being applied to and
 
00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:31.620 align:start position:0%
it's you're uh is is your mortgages your
 
00:11:34.970 --> 00:11:34.980 align:start position:0%
escrow account if you have one
 
00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:37.980 align:start position:0%
they're all escrow accounts yeah
 
00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
okay yep is there another any other uh
 
00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.370 align:start position:0%
okay yep is there another any other uh
similar

00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:43.380 align:start position:0%
similar
 
00:11:47.389 --> 00:11:47.399 align:start position:0%
I I I thought I heard too you did FDIC
 
00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:50.040 align:start position:0%
but is there another index that you're
 
00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:51.420 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
00:11:53.389 --> 00:11:53.399 align:start position:0%
no this is
 
00:12:01.009 --> 00:12:01.019 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:03.000 align:start position:0%
um but that will be no more if this
 
00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
passes and the two rsas are the two
 
00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:12.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:15.170 --> 00:12:15.180 align:start position:0%
yes and and Banks both of which have the
 
00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:16.620 align:start position:0%
thing in common that they might hold
 
00:12:18.769 --> 00:12:18.779 align:start position:0%
they might require that their customers
 
00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:20.760 align:start position:0%
have an escrow account and this governs
 
00:12:23.269 --> 00:12:23.279 align:start position:0%
those escrow accounts thank you
 
00:12:28.190 --> 00:12:28.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:29.449 --> 00:12:29.459 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
this is for my own information because
 
00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:35.000 align:start position:0%
I'm new at this but uh section 9
 
00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:37.820 align:start position:0%
describes a person that is allowed to
 
00:12:40.610 --> 00:12:40.620 align:start position:0%
collect this money or transmit this
 
00:12:42.769 --> 00:12:42.779 align:start position:0%
money that has no licenses
 
00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:45.000 align:start position:0%
and I'm trying to describe what kind of
 
00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
a person is this it sounds like somebody
 
00:12:48.769 --> 00:12:48.779 align:start position:0%
just walking off the street I think
 
00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:51.180 align:start position:0%
you're on the next bill that's 522. I'm
 
00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:52.920 align:start position:0%
so sorry we'll get rid of that one you
 
00:12:54.290 --> 00:12:54.300 align:start position:0%
see okay once again you're going to see
 
00:12:58.310 --> 00:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:01.380 align:start position:0%
representative Terry thank you uh just a
 
00:13:02.930 --> 00:13:02.940 align:start position:0%
suggestion with respect to the document
 
00:13:04.970 --> 00:13:04.980 align:start position:0%
that you provided for us it might be
 
00:13:06.889 --> 00:13:06.899 align:start position:0%
helpful and if if you do this in the
 
00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:09.240 align:start position:0%
future if you would just indicate it at
 
00:13:11.629 --> 00:13:11.639 align:start position:0%
the top of the document stayed in one or
 
00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:14.160 align:start position:0%
two sentences what the rationale is for
 
00:13:16.850 --> 00:13:16.860 align:start position:0%
the changes that you're recommending and
 
00:13:19.509 --> 00:13:19.519 align:start position:0%
so um because it's not there let me just
 
00:13:23.629 --> 00:13:23.639 align:start position:0%
uh just for to for you to confirm to me
 
00:13:25.730 --> 00:13:25.740 align:start position:0%
my understanding or to correct my
 
00:13:27.650 --> 00:13:27.660 align:start position:0%
understand misunderstanding
 
00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:29.880 align:start position:0%
the reason that you're going to be using
 
00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
a less shall we say Dynamic rate and
 
00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
move to a more static rate because
 
00:13:36.769 --> 00:13:36.779 align:start position:0%
you're going to change this twice a year
 
00:13:39.889 --> 00:13:39.899 align:start position:0%
is to make it administratively easier
 
00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:42.540 align:start position:0%
for the banks in the mortgages companies
 
00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
to to administer is just a yes yes okay
 
00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:49.260 align:start position:0%
and and also I would add for for us as
 
00:13:50.449 --> 00:13:50.459 align:start position:0%
the banking Department because to the
 
00:13:52.069 --> 00:13:52.079 align:start position:0%
extent we receive a Consumer complaint
 
00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
about an escrow account this makes it
 
00:13:56.569 --> 00:13:56.579 align:start position:0%
much easier like a common complaint that
 
00:13:59.509 --> 00:13:59.519 align:start position:0%
we get is my escrow account is not being
 
00:14:01.490 --> 00:14:01.500 align:start position:0%
accounted for properly you know they
 
00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:03.720 align:start position:0%
didn't pay taxes at the right time fill
 
00:14:05.090 --> 00:14:05.100 align:start position:0%
in the blank
 
00:14:07.129 --> 00:14:07.139 align:start position:0%
um so this will make it easier for us to
 
00:14:08.930 --> 00:14:08.940 align:start position:0%
review as well follow
 
00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
for the question thank you uh do do you
 
00:14:14.389 --> 00:14:14.399 align:start position:0%
foresee that there be any adverse impact
 
00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:17.220 align:start position:0%
upon uh borrowers consumers
 
00:14:19.490 --> 00:14:19.500 align:start position:0%
no I don't I don't think so I mean
 
00:14:23.269 --> 00:14:23.279 align:start position:0%
currently the FED fund rate is higher
 
00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
than this contemplates but it's such a
 
00:14:28.970 --> 00:14:28.980 align:start position:0%
small like there's not tons and tons of
 
00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:31.320 align:start position:0%
money tied up at any given moment in an
 
00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:33.480 align:start position:0%
escrow account there is some there's a
 
00:14:36.530 --> 00:14:36.540 align:start position:0%
cushion but it's not a voluminous amount
 
00:14:38.990 --> 00:14:39.000 align:start position:0%
so I think there would be minimal and
 
00:14:41.569 --> 00:14:41.579 align:start position:0%
that rate has only been in effect for
 
00:14:44.509 --> 00:14:44.519 align:start position:0%
like a year that that's been changing so
 
00:14:46.730 --> 00:14:46.740 align:start position:0%
I think it's pretty de minimis okay
 
00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:48.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:14:50.569 --> 00:14:50.579 align:start position:0%
okay anybody else
 
00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:52.860 align:start position:0%
oh representative
 
00:14:54.949 --> 00:14:54.959 align:start position:0%
what do you say oh
 
00:14:57.350 --> 00:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:14:58.970 --> 00:14:58.980 align:start position:0%
uh just trying to understand the last
 
00:15:00.889 --> 00:15:00.899 align:start position:0%
sentence the uh
 
00:15:04.069 --> 00:15:04.079 align:start position:0%
the 0.5 cap
 
00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
um because maybe it's escrow that's it's
 
00:15:08.389 --> 00:15:08.399 align:start position:0%
different than a savings account right
 
00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:10.440 align:start position:0%
but we're used to near zero interest
 
00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:13.860 align:start position:0%
rates but as the FED has been tightening
 
00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:16.440 align:start position:0%
we're going to see interest rates on
 
00:15:18.829 --> 00:15:18.839 align:start position:0%
savings accounts go up I'm looking at
 
00:15:20.329 --> 00:15:20.339 align:start position:0%
bank rate it's between three and four
 
00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:22.740 align:start position:0%
percent right now so if you just help me
 
00:15:24.949 --> 00:15:24.959 align:start position:0%
understand the cap on the half a percent
 
00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:28.620 align:start position:0%
sure so um an escrow account is both a
 
00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:29.509 align:start position:0%
sure so um an escrow account is both a
service

00:15:29.509 --> 00:15:29.519 align:start position:0%
service
 
00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:31.500 align:start position:0%
it's like some it's something that the
 
00:15:34.189 --> 00:15:34.199 align:start position:0%
bank requires of most consumers but it
 
00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:36.120 align:start position:0%
also assists the consumer so there's a
 
00:15:37.610 --> 00:15:37.620 align:start position:0%
balance right
 
00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:39.240 align:start position:0%
um the bank is interested in having the
 
00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
Escrow because it helps protect the
 
00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:43.860 align:start position:0%
collateral make sure that the taxes are
 
00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:46.680 align:start position:0%
paid the consumer also benefits in some
 
00:15:49.069 --> 00:15:49.079 align:start position:0%
ways because the bank is effectively
 
00:15:51.650 --> 00:15:51.660 align:start position:0%
paying their taxes they're providing a
 
00:15:54.350 --> 00:15:54.360 align:start position:0%
service so we felt like that cap was a a
 
00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:56.160 align:start position:0%
reasonable compromise of those two
 
00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:58.009 align:start position:0%
reasonable compromise of those two
interests

00:15:58.009 --> 00:15:58.019 align:start position:0%
interests
 
00:16:00.530 --> 00:16:00.540 align:start position:0%
will beg the interest how how high would
 
00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:02.040 align:start position:0%
the interest rate to be higher than the
 
00:16:03.470 --> 00:16:03.480 align:start position:0%
half percent
 
00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:06.240 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry well so this based on right
 
00:16:07.910 --> 00:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
now our interest rates are like four
 
00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:10.260 align:start position:0%
percent right or five percent or yeah
 
00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
for for a mortgage well so a mortgage is
 
00:16:14.629 --> 00:16:14.639 align:start position:0%
different this is for the escrow
 
00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:16.320 align:start position:0%
accounts so
 
00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:16.910 align:start position:0%
accounts so
um

00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:16.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:19.189 --> 00:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
there's a range I mean I think that New
 
00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:21.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Charter Banks like which is
 
00:16:23.449 --> 00:16:23.459 align:start position:0%
what we based it on in the past so for
 
00:16:26.090 --> 00:16:26.100 align:start position:0%
13 years this rate has been zero because
 
00:16:28.490 --> 00:16:28.500 align:start position:0%
we would take we would take in all the
 
00:16:31.310 --> 00:16:31.320 align:start position:0%
the rates the interest rates chart uh
 
00:16:34.189 --> 00:16:34.199 align:start position:0%
provided by Banks New Hampshire Charter
 
00:16:36.410 --> 00:16:36.420 align:start position:0%
banks on their savings account
 
00:16:38.749 --> 00:16:38.759 align:start position:0%
average them out and subtract one that's
 
00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:40.440 align:start position:0%
how it used to be that's impact one
 
00:16:42.590 --> 00:16:42.600 align:start position:0%
right yeah we subtract one so it was
 
00:16:44.569 --> 00:16:44.579 align:start position:0%
it's been zero for the whole time I've
 
00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:47.160 align:start position:0%
been at the banking Department
 
00:16:49.189 --> 00:16:49.199 align:start position:0%
um because it's an escrow account not
 
00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
but I remember the days when interest
 
00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:54.720 align:start position:0%
rates were 16 so oh expense but while I
 
00:16:56.689 --> 00:16:56.699 align:start position:0%
say that because for 13 years it's been
 
00:16:59.210 --> 00:16:59.220 align:start position:0%
zero but I don't think for 13 maybe for
 
00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:00.600 align:start position:0%
13 years now
 
00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:03.000 align:start position:0%
I think there's been a range of
 
00:17:05.090 --> 00:17:05.100 align:start position:0%
potential if you have money in a savings
 
00:17:06.590 --> 00:17:06.600 align:start position:0%
account that you can get if you move it
 
00:17:08.569 --> 00:17:08.579 align:start position:0%
around or whatever
 
00:17:11.210 --> 00:17:11.220 align:start position:0%
um so I think this is the goal is to be
 
00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:14.640 align:start position:0%
not burdensome and to strike that
 
00:17:16.490 --> 00:17:16.500 align:start position:0%
balance because it's always a balance
 
00:17:19.309 --> 00:17:19.319 align:start position:0%
between you know the consumer's interest
 
00:17:22.549 --> 00:17:22.559 align:start position:0%
and the service provided by the bank so
 
00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
this struck us that this was a good
 
00:17:25.669 --> 00:17:25.679 align:start position:0%
balance based on that because this will
 
00:17:27.230 --> 00:17:27.240 align:start position:0%
make it not zero like it's never going
 
00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:28.860 align:start position:0%
to be zero again and it's been zero for
 
00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:31.440 align:start position:0%
13 years so
 
00:17:33.530 --> 00:17:33.540 align:start position:0%
um by setting that cap I mean that floor
 
00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:35.029 align:start position:0%
um by setting that cap I mean that floor
so

00:17:35.029 --> 00:17:35.039 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:17:37.970 --> 00:17:37.980 align:start position:0%
like it's it's a compromise right
 
00:17:40.610 --> 00:17:40.620 align:start position:0%
well yeah I guess so if I just think one
 
00:17:43.010 --> 00:17:43.020 align:start position:0%
so that for discussion purposes that's
 
00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:48.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:51.529 --> 00:17:51.539 align:start position:0%
you can't but an assets are higher now
 
00:17:53.870 --> 00:17:53.880 align:start position:0%
aren't they higher than that now it
 
00:17:55.850 --> 00:17:55.860 align:start position:0%
depends on where you look
 
00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:57.409 align:start position:0%
depends on where you look
um

00:17:57.409 --> 00:17:57.419 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:57.419 --> 00:17:58.610 align:start position:0%
um
okay

00:17:58.610 --> 00:17:58.620 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:18:01.549 --> 00:18:01.559 align:start position:0%
but with with a CD you're trying to hide
 
00:18:03.650 --> 00:18:03.660 align:start position:0%
the money up at that specific period of
 
00:18:06.110 --> 00:18:06.120 align:start position:0%
time yeah so you can really compare it
 
00:18:07.850 --> 00:18:07.860 align:start position:0%
it's because again they're providing
 
00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
that service where they pay the taxes
 
00:18:11.210 --> 00:18:11.220 align:start position:0%
and there's an admit there's a burden on
 
00:18:13.010 --> 00:18:13.020 align:start position:0%
that there's assumption that the the
 
00:18:15.110 --> 00:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
financial institution is not using that
 
00:18:16.490 --> 00:18:16.500 align:start position:0%
cash for anything else other than
 
00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:19.200 align:start position:0%
sitting in correct in in the Escrow
 
00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
because it has to so most of them
 
00:18:22.490 --> 00:18:22.500 align:start position:0%
require it to be a cushion of so many
 
00:18:25.010 --> 00:18:25.020 align:start position:0%
months every six months you're paying
 
00:18:27.710 --> 00:18:27.720 align:start position:0%
them so there's yeah death in taxes
 
00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:29.340 align:start position:0%
twice a year that's a diet twice a year
 
00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:30.909 align:start position:0%
twice a year that's a diet twice a year
yep

00:18:30.909 --> 00:18:30.919 align:start position:0%
yep
 
00:18:33.770 --> 00:18:33.780 align:start position:0%
okay representative so in fact the money
 
00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:36.240 align:start position:0%
that are in the escrow accounts cannot
 
00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:37.980 align:start position:0%
be used for any other purposes they're
 
00:18:40.850 --> 00:18:40.860 align:start position:0%
walled off that's a question for I would
 
00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:42.840 align:start position:0%
because that really goes to the heart of
 
00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:44.340 align:start position:0%
the question that the chairman is
 
00:18:46.970 --> 00:18:46.980 align:start position:0%
Raising and and uh representative Ammon
 
00:18:50.210 --> 00:18:50.220 align:start position:0%
that if if interest rates are two three
 
00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:53.400 align:start position:0%
four five percent and you've set a
 
00:18:56.630 --> 00:18:56.640 align:start position:0%
ceiling of 0.5 percent in the banks or
 
00:18:59.390 --> 00:18:59.400 align:start position:0%
the mortgage lenders have an opportunity
 
00:19:01.610 --> 00:19:01.620 align:start position:0%
to take that money while it's in escrow
 
00:19:04.789 --> 00:19:04.799 align:start position:0%
and invest it then um they're making out
 
00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:08.220 align:start position:0%
pretty well when interest rates are are
 
00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:13.260 align:start position:0%
higher than 0.5 zero percent am I not
 
00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:16.440 align:start position:0%
understanding this so I would defer to
 
00:19:19.010 --> 00:19:19.020 align:start position:0%
the bankers Association because they and
 
00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
I can't remember the date of the exact
 
00:19:22.490 --> 00:19:22.500 align:start position:0%
numbers that they present me I would
 
00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
need to do a little bit of research I
 
00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:25.020 align:start position:0%
could probably get you that information
 
00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:26.940 align:start position:0%
for the subcommittee work session to
 
00:19:28.789 --> 00:19:28.799 align:start position:0%
give you the numbers on how much they
 
00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:30.120 align:start position:0%
cost because
 
00:19:32.930 --> 00:19:32.940 align:start position:0%
operating an escrow account costs the
 
00:19:34.909 --> 00:19:34.919 align:start position:0%
bank money is my understanding and I
 
00:19:36.409 --> 00:19:36.419 align:start position:0%
would have to go and look at those exact
 
00:19:36.419 --> 00:19:37.430 align:start position:0%
would have to go and look at those exact
numbers

00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:37.440 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
00:19:38.930 --> 00:19:38.940 align:start position:0%
I do understand what your question but
 
00:19:41.570 --> 00:19:41.580 align:start position:0%
that's a huge yeah well it's huge only
 
00:19:44.090 --> 00:19:44.100 align:start position:0%
that's a huge that's a huge uh
 
00:19:46.669 --> 00:19:46.679 align:start position:0%
difference as with respect to whether or
 
00:19:48.409 --> 00:19:48.419 align:start position:0%
not they can take all of the the
 
00:19:51.289 --> 00:19:51.299 align:start position:0%
aggregate sums of All the Monies that
 
00:19:54.529 --> 00:19:54.539 align:start position:0%
are in escrow and invest them on a
 
00:19:56.390 --> 00:19:56.400 align:start position:0%
dynamic basis which I'm sure they're
 
00:19:58.850 --> 00:19:58.860 align:start position:0%
very capable of doing
 
00:20:02.029 --> 00:20:02.039 align:start position:0%
or not being able to do that and I mean
 
00:20:04.010 --> 00:20:04.020 align:start position:0%
that so yes I would like to answer that
 
00:20:05.690 --> 00:20:05.700 align:start position:0%
question because I think it's absolutely
 
00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:11.090 --> 00:20:11.100 align:start position:0%
let me buy correct they did some
 
00:20:14.090 --> 00:20:14.100 align:start position:0%
analysis on the the costs versus the
 
00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:16.200 align:start position:0%
benefit of the escrow account that I'm
 
00:20:17.930 --> 00:20:17.940 align:start position:0%
sure that they can provide you and I'm
 
00:20:19.730 --> 00:20:19.740 align:start position:0%
happy to go back and research your
 
00:20:22.190 --> 00:20:22.200 align:start position:0%
question further
 
00:20:24.650 --> 00:20:24.660 align:start position:0%
yeah so actually it kind of begs the
 
00:20:26.150 --> 00:20:26.160 align:start position:0%
question of how people feel about the
 
00:20:27.529 --> 00:20:27.539 align:start position:0%
escrow accounts because I know for
 
00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
myself that
 
00:20:32.150 --> 00:20:32.160 align:start position:0%
um my financial institution
 
00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't require Escrow because I have
 
00:20:37.730 --> 00:20:37.740 align:start position:0%
direct payment I have automatic payments
 
00:20:38.990 --> 00:20:39.000 align:start position:0%
yeah it
 
00:20:42.169 --> 00:20:42.179 align:start position:0%
in the terms of any any given mortgage
 
00:20:43.850 --> 00:20:43.860 align:start position:0%
and that is set between
 
00:20:46.549 --> 00:20:46.559 align:start position:0%
and the bank at the time they contract
 
00:20:46.559 --> 00:20:47.450 align:start position:0%
and the bank at the time they contract
um

00:20:47.450 --> 00:20:47.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:49.909 --> 00:20:49.919 align:start position:0%
it really depends on the a lot of
 
00:20:51.230 --> 00:20:51.240 align:start position:0%
different factors the financial where
 
00:20:53.870 --> 00:20:53.880 align:start position:0%
with all of the um applicant for the
 
00:20:57.650 --> 00:20:57.660 align:start position:0%
loan the collateral all sorts of
 
00:20:59.570 --> 00:20:59.580 align:start position:0%
calculations go into whether or not you
 
00:21:01.789 --> 00:21:01.799 align:start position:0%
have an escrow so not you're correct not
 
00:21:04.190 --> 00:21:04.200 align:start position:0%
everyone has an escrow account
 
00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:05.090 align:start position:0%
everyone has an escrow account
um

00:21:05.090 --> 00:21:05.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:07.789 --> 00:21:07.799 align:start position:0%
okay sometimes it's mandatory some yeah
 
00:21:10.669 --> 00:21:10.679 align:start position:0%
it's mandatory you say it's mandatory
 
00:21:15.230 --> 00:21:15.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:16.549 --> 00:21:16.559 align:start position:0%
we're talking about a mortgage talking
 
00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:25.130 --> 00:21:25.140 align:start position:0%
no I'm saying if I have a mortgage and
 
00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
the conversation was about do uh you
 
00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:29.640 align:start position:0%
know in terms of escrowing
 
00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:31.130 align:start position:0%
know in terms of escrowing
taxes

00:21:31.130 --> 00:21:31.140 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
00:21:35.210 --> 00:21:35.220 align:start position:0%
I can wave that escrow on your taxes if
 
00:21:37.430 --> 00:21:37.440 align:start position:0%
I give them direct you know automatic
 
00:21:39.529 --> 00:21:39.539 align:start position:0%
payment right it's only if the bank
 
00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:42.480 align:start position:0%
insists on an escrow that because they
 
00:21:43.610 --> 00:21:43.620 align:start position:0%
want to make sure to pay you the
 
00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
insurance and the taxes that this would
 
00:21:48.110 --> 00:21:48.120 align:start position:0%
come into play right yeah it depends on
 
00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
a lot of different factors um any given
 
00:21:52.730 --> 00:21:52.740 align:start position:0%
person may or may not have an escrow
 
00:21:54.289 --> 00:21:54.299 align:start position:0%
account if they have a mortgage it's
 
00:21:56.570 --> 00:21:56.580 align:start position:0%
credit worthiness it's collateral
 
00:21:57.950 --> 00:21:57.960 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of other there's a lot of
 
00:21:59.570 --> 00:21:59.580 align:start position:0%
factors that go into weather loan to
 
00:22:01.909 --> 00:22:01.919 align:start position:0%
value loan to value exactly
 
00:22:03.529 --> 00:22:03.539 align:start position:0%
um all sorts of factors
 
00:22:03.539 --> 00:22:05.330 align:start position:0%
um all sorts of factors
okay

00:22:05.330 --> 00:22:05.340 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:22:07.549 --> 00:22:07.559 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you all right
 
00:22:09.169 --> 00:22:09.179 align:start position:0%
the chair will call on Ryan Hale from
 
00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:24.230 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:22:24.230 --> 00:22:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:27.409 --> 00:22:27.419 align:start position:0%
good morning chairman members of the
 
00:22:29.330 --> 00:22:29.340 align:start position:0%
Commerce Committee for the record my
 
00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:30.720 align:start position:0%
name is Ryan Hale I'm vice president
 
00:22:32.090 --> 00:22:32.100 align:start position:0%
governor relations for New Hampshire
 
00:22:35.029 --> 00:22:35.039 align:start position:0%
Bankers we represent 38 member banks
 
00:22:37.250 --> 00:22:37.260 align:start position:0%
which employ roughly 6 000 employees
 
00:22:39.470 --> 00:22:39.480 align:start position:0%
here in the state of New Hampshire
 
00:22:42.289 --> 00:22:42.299 align:start position:0%
um I come before the committee uh not in
 
00:22:44.990 --> 00:22:45.000 align:start position:0%
uh not a position on the underlying bill
 
00:22:48.649 --> 00:22:48.659 align:start position:0%
but in support of the language that
 
00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
commissioner galtiari has provided the
 
00:22:54.169 --> 00:22:54.179 align:start position:0%
committee we really appreciate her and
 
00:22:56.690 --> 00:22:56.700 align:start position:0%
her team's work on this to trying to
 
00:23:00.049 --> 00:23:00.059 align:start position:0%
address our concerns back when this bill
 
00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:02.960 align:start position:0%
passed two years ago
 
00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
we we were supportive of it but after
 
00:23:09.289 --> 00:23:09.299 align:start position:0%
the rollout there were some issues that
 
00:23:10.730 --> 00:23:10.740 align:start position:0%
did come up
 
00:23:13.630 --> 00:23:13.640 align:start position:0%
um as far as the implementation
 
00:23:16.850 --> 00:23:16.860 align:start position:0%
especially as the FED continued to raise
 
00:23:19.970 --> 00:23:19.980 align:start position:0%
interest rates and how it played with
 
00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
banks core providers which are the back
 
00:23:24.490 --> 00:23:24.500 align:start position:0%
end systems that
 
00:23:27.590 --> 00:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
that transact um that that manage the
 
00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:30.720 align:start position:0%
transactions uh for for the banks
 
00:23:34.310 --> 00:23:34.320 align:start position:0%
um in the in the original language of
 
00:23:36.409 --> 00:23:36.419 align:start position:0%
that bill that passed two years ago it
 
00:23:40.610 --> 00:23:40.620 align:start position:0%
didn't specify exactly when uh that
 
00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
um the interest rate had to be changed
 
00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:44.760 align:start position:0%
so one would assume that it was
 
00:23:47.330 --> 00:23:47.340 align:start position:0%
immediate when the FED raised the rate
 
00:23:51.409 --> 00:23:51.419 align:start position:0%
and so the concern was uh what we heard
 
00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
from some of our members was
 
00:23:55.250 --> 00:23:55.260 align:start position:0%
um whether or not having to back date
 
00:23:58.250 --> 00:23:58.260 align:start position:0%
and if you missed a day or uh missed it
 
00:24:01.370 --> 00:24:01.380 align:start position:0%
by a day we were told by one member in
 
00:24:03.169 --> 00:24:03.179 align:start position:0%
particular that they would have to then
 
00:24:05.570 --> 00:24:05.580 align:start position:0%
manually go in and change the interest
 
00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:07.980 align:start position:0%
rate on all 1800 of their escrow
 
00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:09.409 align:start position:0%
rate on all 1800 of their escrow
accounts

00:24:09.409 --> 00:24:09.419 align:start position:0%
accounts
 
00:24:13.130 --> 00:24:13.140 align:start position:0%
um so it it did prove to be a very um uh
 
00:24:14.930 --> 00:24:14.940 align:start position:0%
tedious process
 
00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:17.400 align:start position:0%
um and with it changing now monthly
 
00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:20.640 align:start position:0%
um this this language addresses that
 
00:24:25.930 --> 00:24:25.940 align:start position:0%
concern uh by one tying it to the f DIC
 
00:24:28.610 --> 00:24:28.620 align:start position:0%
savings account rate as well as giving
 
00:24:32.110 --> 00:24:32.120 align:start position:0%
on ramp to when that has to be changed
 
00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
I think the commissioner did a really
 
00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:36.960 align:start position:0%
good job explaining the you know escrow
 
00:24:38.450 --> 00:24:38.460 align:start position:0%
accounts there are high maintenance
 
00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:39.770 align:start position:0%
accounts there are high maintenance
accounts

00:24:39.770 --> 00:24:39.780 align:start position:0%
accounts
 
00:24:42.409 --> 00:24:42.419 align:start position:0%
um one of my Bankers shared that there's
 
00:24:44.390 --> 00:24:44.400 align:start position:0%
two individuals within the bank that
 
00:24:48.169 --> 00:24:48.179 align:start position:0%
manage these accounts for uh for the
 
00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:52.320 align:start position:0%
bank they have to monitor uh all the
 
00:24:54.529 --> 00:24:54.539 align:start position:0%
municipalities and changes to their
 
00:24:58.190 --> 00:24:58.200 align:start position:0%
taxes and then issue checks um twice
 
00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:00.240 align:start position:0%
twice a year in some cases as well as
 
00:25:03.770 --> 00:25:03.780 align:start position:0%
pay the insurance it is a service to the
 
00:25:05.330 --> 00:25:05.340 align:start position:0%
to the consumer
 
00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:09.360 align:start position:0%
um and it it is uh it is a way to help
 
00:25:11.570 --> 00:25:11.580 align:start position:0%
protect the interest also of the bank by
 
00:25:15.289 --> 00:25:15.299 align:start position:0%
ensuring taxes are up to up to date so
 
00:25:16.789 --> 00:25:16.799 align:start position:0%
at that point I will pause uh
 
00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:18.480 align:start position:0%
representative Terry great question
 
00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:19.669 align:start position:0%
representative Terry great question
about

00:25:19.669 --> 00:25:19.679 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:25:22.370 --> 00:25:22.380 align:start position:0%
um whether or not they can invest I I'm
 
00:25:24.289 --> 00:25:24.299 align:start position:0%
not clear sure about the answer but I'm
 
00:25:26.390 --> 00:25:26.400 align:start position:0%
happy to look into that and get you get
 
00:25:28.850 --> 00:25:28.860 align:start position:0%
back to you so happy to take any further
 
00:25:30.830 --> 00:25:30.840 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
00:25:33.769 --> 00:25:33.779 align:start position:0%
right representative Ammon
 
00:25:36.169 --> 00:25:36.179 align:start position:0%
thank you for testifying Mr Hill
 
00:25:38.090 --> 00:25:38.100 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chair
 
00:25:40.850 --> 00:25:40.860 align:start position:0%
the current statute says that the
 
00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:43.440 align:start position:0%
interest rate is posted on the
 
00:25:46.490 --> 00:25:46.500 align:start position:0%
commissioner's website if
 
00:25:48.350 --> 00:25:48.360 align:start position:0%
the commissioner shall post the rate on
 
00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
the department's website and so I'm
 
00:26:05.169 --> 00:26:05.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:07.490 --> 00:26:07.500 align:start position:0%
so I guess I'm interested in what the
 
00:26:10.250 --> 00:26:10.260 align:start position:0%
rate is right now that that would be
 
00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:12.240 align:start position:0%
so it's if somewhere on this website it
 
00:26:14.510 --> 00:26:14.520 align:start position:0%
says zero percent okay all right thank
 
00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:18.610 align:start position:0%
says zero percent okay all right thank
you

00:26:18.610 --> 00:26:18.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:22.690 --> 00:26:22.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:27.970 --> 00:26:27.980 align:start position:0%
and is it zero because of the minus one
 
00:26:30.649 --> 00:26:30.659 align:start position:0%
but it's the minus one that that brought
 
00:26:41.450 --> 00:26:41.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:41.460 --> 00:26:44.750 align:start position:0%
 
right

00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:44.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:47.210 --> 00:26:47.220 align:start position:0%
so you have to look when you look at CD
 
00:26:48.890 --> 00:26:48.900 align:start position:0%
accounts you got to look at New
 
00:26:50.570 --> 00:26:50.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Banks not
 
00:26:52.730 --> 00:26:52.740 align:start position:0%
that Capital One which he was looking at
 
00:26:55.130 --> 00:26:55.140 align:start position:0%
which is three and a half percent five
 
00:26:55.140 --> 00:27:04.310 align:start position:0%
which is three and a half percent five
percent

00:27:04.310 --> 00:27:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:06.289 --> 00:27:06.299 align:start position:0%
never used anyways right and their
 
00:27:07.610 --> 00:27:07.620 align:start position:0%
demand savings I'm looking at the
 
00:27:09.350 --> 00:27:09.360 align:start position:0%
department website no I understand that
 
00:27:10.730 --> 00:27:10.740 align:start position:0%
but I was at the screen you looked at
 
00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:12.480 align:start position:0%
before which which shows you higher
 
00:27:15.049 --> 00:27:15.059 align:start position:0%
interest rates representative Herbert
 
00:27:15.059 --> 00:27:17.570 align:start position:0%
interest rates representative Herbert
um

00:27:17.570 --> 00:27:17.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:19.440 align:start position:0%
it's a good thing you have Escrow
 
00:27:21.049 --> 00:27:21.059 align:start position:0%
because I mean that's a
 
00:27:24.409 --> 00:27:24.419 align:start position:0%
a hedge but uh
 
00:27:26.930 --> 00:27:26.940 align:start position:0%
and I'm assuming most people do have
 
00:27:29.450 --> 00:27:29.460 align:start position:0%
escrows on mortgages not everybody goes
 
00:27:31.370 --> 00:27:31.380 align:start position:0%
in and pays cash for
 
00:27:33.710 --> 00:27:33.720 align:start position:0%
a piece of property
 
00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:34.610 align:start position:0%
a piece of property
um

00:27:34.610 --> 00:27:34.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:36.480 align:start position:0%
what happens
 
00:27:39.409 --> 00:27:39.419 align:start position:0%
and maybe 13 years is not more than
 
00:27:41.210 --> 00:27:41.220 align:start position:0%
ironic uh
 
00:27:43.250 --> 00:27:43.260 align:start position:0%
what happens when all of a sudden
 
00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:44.630 align:start position:0%
what happens when all of a sudden
um

00:27:44.630 --> 00:27:44.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:46.789 --> 00:27:46.799 align:start position:0%
a pant load of people go unemployed all
 
00:27:49.130 --> 00:27:49.140 align:start position:0%
of a sudden because the Federal Reserve
 
00:27:50.930 --> 00:27:50.940 align:start position:0%
created a recession
 
00:27:54.649 --> 00:27:54.659 align:start position:0%
does that what's the impact on your
 
00:27:56.450 --> 00:27:56.460 align:start position:0%
on the banks
 
00:27:59.269 --> 00:27:59.279 align:start position:0%
uh in terms of these people now can't
 
00:27:59.279 --> 00:28:01.310 align:start position:0%
uh in terms of these people now can't
pay

00:28:01.310 --> 00:28:01.320 align:start position:0%
pay
 
00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:03.360 align:start position:0%
you know 13 years ago I think that was
 
00:28:05.090 --> 00:28:05.100 align:start position:0%
the situation
 
00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
definitely a common so I'm curious as to
 
00:28:12.590 --> 00:28:12.600 align:start position:0%
what what do you do if the Federal
 
00:28:16.430 --> 00:28:16.440 align:start position:0%
Reserve becomes successful and puts 20
 
00:28:21.310 --> 00:28:21.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:25.130 --> 00:28:25.140 align:start position:0%
so I'm not uh so uh I mean I think you
 
00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
have a hedge but uh
 
00:28:28.909 --> 00:28:28.919 align:start position:0%
now they're not going to be paying I I
 
00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
just don't uh
 
00:28:32.810 --> 00:28:32.820 align:start position:0%
what happened the last time this
 
00:28:35.810 --> 00:28:35.820 align:start position:0%
happened uh we'll we'll work on figuring
 
00:28:45.370 --> 00:28:45.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:49.850 --> 00:28:49.860 align:start position:0%
yes representative Terry so the the uh
 
00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
account so the rates that you're
 
00:28:54.529 --> 00:28:54.539 align:start position:0%
surveying are State chartered Banks
 
00:28:58.789 --> 00:28:58.799 align:start position:0%
yes and they're they're what we might
 
00:29:01.310 --> 00:29:01.320 align:start position:0%
call demand savings accounts rates not
 
00:29:03.470 --> 00:29:03.480 align:start position:0%
time deposits
 
00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:05.090 align:start position:0%
time deposits
what

00:29:05.090 --> 00:29:05.100 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:29:08.570 --> 00:29:08.580 align:start position:0%
what rates are you surveying on on what
 
00:29:11.090 --> 00:29:11.100 align:start position:0%
kinds of accounts
 
00:29:14.570 --> 00:29:14.580 align:start position:0%
yeah anybody so so you have to where we
 
00:29:16.190 --> 00:29:16.200 align:start position:0%
have actually kind of sidetracked the
 
00:29:18.350 --> 00:29:18.360 align:start position:0%
whole conversation when we brought in
 
00:29:22.610 --> 00:29:22.620 align:start position:0%
CDs okay in CD interests what we have
 
00:29:26.029 --> 00:29:26.039 align:start position:0%
heard from the bank commissioner is that
 
00:29:28.450 --> 00:29:28.460 align:start position:0%
is probably not the right thing to do
 
00:29:31.370 --> 00:29:31.380 align:start position:0%
because no one is in that position to
 
00:29:33.409 --> 00:29:33.419 align:start position:0%
say is well do I want to have an escrow
 
00:29:35.630 --> 00:29:35.640 align:start position:0%
or do I want to put the money in the CD
 
00:29:37.850 --> 00:29:37.860 align:start position:0%
and earn a higher interest rate and then
 
00:29:40.010 --> 00:29:40.020 align:start position:0%
tell the bank oh you can have you can
 
00:29:42.769 --> 00:29:42.779 align:start position:0%
have that uh you can have that as
 
00:29:45.470 --> 00:29:45.480 align:start position:0%
collateral to making sure I pay my taxes
 
00:29:47.810 --> 00:29:47.820 align:start position:0%
on time okay so that conversation
 
00:29:51.169 --> 00:29:51.179 align:start position:0%
doesn't exist the issue was that when
 
00:29:52.730 --> 00:29:52.740 align:start position:0%
representative Ammon brought up it says
 
00:29:54.889 --> 00:29:54.899 align:start position:0%
boy this is pretty low percent
 
00:29:59.029 --> 00:29:59.039 align:start position:0%
you know why is it so low because in the
 
00:30:01.909 --> 00:30:01.919 align:start position:0%
reality for banks evidently
 
00:30:04.549 --> 00:30:04.559 align:start position:0%
it's really a burden to run these escrow
 
00:30:06.590 --> 00:30:06.600 align:start position:0%
accounts because they got to hire
 
00:30:08.810 --> 00:30:08.820 align:start position:0%
multiple employees they've got to
 
00:30:11.149 --> 00:30:11.159 align:start position:0%
segment the money they got to write that
 
00:30:14.269 --> 00:30:14.279 align:start position:0%
check you know twice a year they've got
 
00:30:16.370 --> 00:30:16.380 align:start position:0%
to keep track of it and so they're
 
00:30:19.430 --> 00:30:19.440 align:start position:0%
saying is how do you factor in the cost
 
00:30:22.430 --> 00:30:22.440 align:start position:0%
that the bank has to maintain that
 
00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:24.480 align:start position:0%
escrow account which you would not have
 
00:30:27.289 --> 00:30:27.299 align:start position:0%
if you were saying oh that money's in my
 
00:30:30.529 --> 00:30:30.539 align:start position:0%
CD and uh and I have my CD set up to
 
00:30:33.350 --> 00:30:33.360 align:start position:0%
roll over every six months so that it
 
00:30:35.450 --> 00:30:35.460 align:start position:0%
can make my payment for my property tax
 
00:30:35.460 --> 00:30:37.010 align:start position:0%
can make my payment for my property tax
bill

00:30:37.010 --> 00:30:37.020 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:30:38.510 --> 00:30:38.520 align:start position:0%
well that's that's a reasonable
 
00:30:41.930 --> 00:30:41.940 align:start position:0%
supposition uh which you've just laid
 
00:30:43.490 --> 00:30:43.500 align:start position:0%
out there
 
00:30:46.310 --> 00:30:46.320 align:start position:0%
but but if but the way I was attempting
 
00:30:49.130 --> 00:30:49.140 align:start position:0%
to frame the question is if if if past
 
00:30:50.690 --> 00:30:50.700 align:start position:0%
books that we used to call past book
 
00:30:52.909 --> 00:30:52.919 align:start position:0%
savings accounts are paying get to a
 
00:30:54.110 --> 00:30:54.120 align:start position:0%
point where they're paying three percent
 
00:30:55.970 --> 00:30:55.980 align:start position:0%
or four percent
 
00:30:59.690 --> 00:30:59.700 align:start position:0%
and the escrow cap is 0.5
 
00:31:01.730 --> 00:31:01.740 align:start position:0%
um and I had the option of whether or
 
00:31:02.990 --> 00:31:03.000 align:start position:0%
not I wanted to have an escrow account
 
00:31:04.669 --> 00:31:04.679 align:start position:0%
I'd be out of my mind financially
 
00:31:06.769 --> 00:31:06.779 align:start position:0%
speaking to opt for an escrow account
 
00:31:08.990 --> 00:31:09.000 align:start position:0%
when I could be making four percent on
 
00:31:11.269 --> 00:31:11.279 align:start position:0%
his passbook but what we're getting at
 
00:31:13.490 --> 00:31:13.500 align:start position:0%
here is the people who are mandated to
 
00:31:15.710 --> 00:31:15.720 align:start position:0%
have Esco accounts and they they would
 
00:31:17.870 --> 00:31:17.880 align:start position:0%
only be able to get 0.5 under this time
 
00:31:20.990 --> 00:31:21.000 align:start position:0%
I believe it's a mortgage is a very
 
00:31:23.810 --> 00:31:23.820 align:start position:0%
active Marketplace and so no one is
 
00:31:26.029 --> 00:31:26.039 align:start position:0%
being mandated to have that escrow
 
00:31:28.250 --> 00:31:28.260 align:start position:0%
account that would be the relationship
 
00:31:30.409 --> 00:31:30.419 align:start position:0%
that you have with that bank that is
 
00:31:32.870 --> 00:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
giving you that mortgage and if you
 
00:31:34.909 --> 00:31:34.919 align:start position:0%
don't like it if you don't want to do
 
00:31:36.950 --> 00:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
the escrow account you certainly are
 
00:31:39.950 --> 00:31:39.960 align:start position:0%
free to go shop around to another bank
 
00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:41.870 align:start position:0%
free to go shop around to another bank
perhaps

00:31:41.870 --> 00:31:41.880 align:start position:0%
perhaps
 
00:31:44.210 --> 00:31:44.220 align:start position:0%
practically speaking if your loan to
 
00:31:47.750 --> 00:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
value is 98 or 99 I would challenge you
 
00:31:49.789 --> 00:31:49.799 align:start position:0%
to find a lending institution that is
 
00:31:51.649 --> 00:31:51.659 align:start position:0%
going to give you the option of not
 
00:31:53.330 --> 00:31:53.340 align:start position:0%
having an escrow accountant and I speak
 
00:31:56.870 --> 00:31:56.880 align:start position:0%
on personal experience okay okay so I
 
00:31:58.310 --> 00:31:58.320 align:start position:0%
think we're getting a little off the
 
00:32:01.010 --> 00:32:01.020 align:start position:0%
subject here so so you know I mean in
 
00:32:03.049 --> 00:32:03.059 align:start position:0%
terms of do we want to clean this up
 
00:32:04.970 --> 00:32:04.980 align:start position:0%
this is something that it seems a
 
00:32:06.710 --> 00:32:06.720 align:start position:0%
reasonable compromise between the
 
00:32:08.149 --> 00:32:08.159 align:start position:0%
banking Department trying to do this
 
00:32:10.490 --> 00:32:10.500 align:start position:0%
efficiently and for the banks if you
 
00:32:11.690 --> 00:32:11.700 align:start position:0%
don't want it if you want to leave the
 
00:32:13.549 --> 00:32:13.559 align:start position:0%
Old Law you don't want to pass anything
 
00:32:15.769 --> 00:32:15.779 align:start position:0%
but in terms of changing this half a
 
00:32:18.409 --> 00:32:18.419 align:start position:0%
percent they have in my mind they have
 
00:32:20.570 --> 00:32:20.580 align:start position:0%
made a case for why it's such a low
 
00:32:23.269 --> 00:32:23.279 align:start position:0%
number and like I say is is as I know
 
00:32:25.310 --> 00:32:25.320 align:start position:0%
for myself personally there are banks
 
00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:26.389 align:start position:0%
for myself personally there are banks
that

00:32:26.389 --> 00:32:26.399 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:32:28.909 --> 00:32:28.919 align:start position:0%
there are banks that will waive it so
 
00:32:30.950 --> 00:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs thank you Mr
 
00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:32.149 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs thank you Mr
chairman

00:32:32.149 --> 00:32:32.159 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:32:32.159 --> 00:32:33.409 align:start position:0%
chairman
um

00:32:33.409 --> 00:32:33.419 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:35.870 --> 00:32:35.880 align:start position:0%
first of all I'm not challenging the
 
00:32:38.750 --> 00:32:38.760 align:start position:0%
amendment to the bill at all uh
 
00:32:41.269 --> 00:32:41.279 align:start position:0%
I just have a question that I think is
 
00:32:43.669 --> 00:32:43.679 align:start position:0%
closely related to it
 
00:32:45.289 --> 00:32:45.299 align:start position:0%
um and I probably should have asked this
 
00:32:47.149 --> 00:32:47.159 align:start position:0%
question of the previous
 
00:32:49.669 --> 00:32:49.679 align:start position:0%
um uh person who testified so if you
 
00:32:52.430 --> 00:32:52.440 align:start position:0%
can't answer it just say so
 
00:32:56.690 --> 00:32:56.700 align:start position:0%
um but my question is uh how does this
 
00:32:58.669 --> 00:32:58.679 align:start position:0%
requirement for how do these
 
00:33:03.049 --> 00:33:03.059 align:start position:0%
requirements for interest apply when a
 
00:33:04.610 --> 00:33:04.620 align:start position:0%
mortgage is purchased through the
 
00:33:10.130 --> 00:33:10.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:14.880 align:start position:0%
so I I I believe that when it's sent off
 
00:33:17.090 --> 00:33:17.100 align:start position:0%
to when it's sold off to the secondary
 
00:33:20.330 --> 00:33:20.340 align:start position:0%
Market the bank still maintains the
 
00:33:22.490 --> 00:33:22.500 align:start position:0%
retains the servicing rights it's my
 
00:33:24.529 --> 00:33:24.539 align:start position:0%
understanding and they will they would
 
00:33:27.710 --> 00:33:27.720 align:start position:0%
then I believe still pay the
 
00:33:30.169 --> 00:33:30.179 align:start position:0%
um Insurance in taxes
 
00:33:32.630 --> 00:33:32.640 align:start position:0%
um further inquiry further inquiry
 
00:33:35.389 --> 00:33:35.399 align:start position:0%
um would you believe that from personal
 
00:33:37.190 --> 00:33:37.200 align:start position:0%
experience I can tell you this is not
 
00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
the case uh because my mortgage was
 
00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
purchased by a bank in Florida and it
 
00:33:46.430 --> 00:33:46.440 align:start position:0%
took me a considerable amount of time to
 
00:33:48.710 --> 00:33:48.720 align:start position:0%
persuade them that in New Hampshire you
 
00:33:52.130 --> 00:33:52.140 align:start position:0%
have to send the property taxes uh to
 
00:33:55.370 --> 00:33:55.380 align:start position:0%
the city and not the county they kept
 
00:33:58.430 --> 00:33:58.440 align:start position:0%
trying to send my property taxes uh to
 
00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
the county which of course it was not
 
00:34:03.230 --> 00:34:03.240 align:start position:0%
going to work in New Hampshire so the uh
 
00:34:05.210 --> 00:34:05.220 align:start position:0%
taxes from the escrow account were
 
00:34:07.970 --> 00:34:07.980 align:start position:0%
definitely being handled by the bank in
 
00:34:10.129 --> 00:34:10.139 align:start position:0%
Florida that had bought out the mortgage
 
00:34:13.490 --> 00:34:13.500 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I misunderst I apologize but I
 
00:34:15.290 --> 00:34:15.300 align:start position:0%
misunderstood your question the original
 
00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:16.430 align:start position:0%
misunderstood your question the original
question

00:34:16.430 --> 00:34:16.440 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:34:18.649 --> 00:34:18.659 align:start position:0%
um as far as the secondary Market but I
 
00:34:20.389 --> 00:34:20.399 align:start position:0%
believe I understand now what you're
 
00:34:22.669 --> 00:34:22.679 align:start position:0%
saying is if it was sold to another out
 
00:34:25.010 --> 00:34:25.020 align:start position:0%
of state bank
 
00:34:26.930 --> 00:34:26.940 align:start position:0%
um they would be on that out of state
 
00:34:29.510 --> 00:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
bank to
 
00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:30.050 align:start position:0%
bank to
um

00:34:30.050 --> 00:34:30.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:33.050 --> 00:34:33.060 align:start position:0%
still take the escrow they require the
 
00:34:34.790 --> 00:34:34.800 align:start position:0%
escrow and pay those
 
00:34:38.329 --> 00:34:38.339 align:start position:0%
pay those taxes and insurance
 
00:34:40.970 --> 00:34:40.980 align:start position:0%
for the question may inquire
 
00:34:44.329 --> 00:34:44.339 align:start position:0%
sorry for the question uh
 
00:34:47.329 --> 00:34:47.339 align:start position:0%
clarification yeah thank you
 
00:34:49.129 --> 00:34:49.139 align:start position:0%
um and the requirement my original
 
00:34:51.470 --> 00:34:51.480 align:start position:0%
question was how do these requirements
 
00:34:52.810 --> 00:34:52.820 align:start position:0%
for interest
 
00:34:56.510 --> 00:34:56.520 align:start position:0%
regarding interest apply to that out of
 
00:34:57.710 --> 00:34:57.720 align:start position:0%
state bank
 
00:35:00.950 --> 00:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
so it's again thank you for the question
 
00:35:03.109 --> 00:35:03.119 align:start position:0%
um it's Meijer stated that
 
00:35:05.630 --> 00:35:05.640 align:start position:0%
um these if it's a and I think the
 
00:35:07.730 --> 00:35:07.740 align:start position:0%
commissioner may be able to help with
 
00:35:10.250 --> 00:35:10.260 align:start position:0%
this but it's my understanding that um
 
00:35:12.050 --> 00:35:12.060 align:start position:0%
out of State Banks if it's a mortgage in
 
00:35:14.270 --> 00:35:14.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that is required to pay
 
00:35:17.990 --> 00:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
interest on escrow or I'm sorry that
 
00:35:19.490 --> 00:35:19.500 align:start position:0%
takes an escrow
 
00:35:21.890 --> 00:35:21.900 align:start position:0%
um they fall under the the requirement
 
00:35:24.829 --> 00:35:24.839 align:start position:0%
to pay interest on that escrow if it's a
 
00:35:26.750 --> 00:35:26.760 align:start position:0%
mortgage in New Hampshire and again I I
 
00:35:28.730 --> 00:35:28.740 align:start position:0%
would ask to turn to the commissioner
 
00:35:32.750 --> 00:35:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:34.730 --> 00:35:34.740 align:start position:0%
yeah why don't you come up to the mic
 
00:35:38.030 --> 00:35:38.040 align:start position:0%
yeah I can project pretty good yeah but
 
00:35:39.890 --> 00:35:39.900 align:start position:0%
um but people at home can't hear you
 
00:35:41.329 --> 00:35:41.339 align:start position:0%
okay okay
 
00:35:43.609 --> 00:35:43.619 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:35:46.670 --> 00:35:46.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:48.410 --> 00:35:48.420 align:start position:0%
apologize I couldn't quite hear from
 
00:35:49.730 --> 00:35:49.740 align:start position:0%
back there everything that was being
 
00:35:52.670 --> 00:35:52.680 align:start position:0%
said my understanding is is you had a
 
00:35:54.890 --> 00:35:54.900 align:start position:0%
mortgage that was perhaps originated by
 
00:35:57.829 --> 00:35:57.839 align:start position:0%
an entity that was a state Chartered
 
00:36:00.650 --> 00:36:00.660 align:start position:0%
Bank it was sold to a Florida State
 
00:36:02.990 --> 00:36:03.000 align:start position:0%
Chartered Bank
 
00:36:04.190 --> 00:36:04.200 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if we've ever been
 
00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:06.720 align:start position:0%
presented with that question before
 
00:36:10.490 --> 00:36:10.500 align:start position:0%
um the RSA 383b applies to State
 
00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:12.480 align:start position:0%
chartered Banks
 
00:36:16.670 --> 00:36:16.680 align:start position:0%
um RSA 397a applies to Mortgage Bankers
 
00:36:19.130 --> 00:36:19.140 align:start position:0%
mortgage brokers mortgage servicers that
 
00:36:21.470 --> 00:36:21.480 align:start position:0%
are licensed with us if it was a
 
00:36:24.770 --> 00:36:24.780 align:start position:0%
licensed entity no doubt yes if it was a
 
00:36:27.770 --> 00:36:27.780 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Bank no doubt yes I've
 
00:36:29.450 --> 00:36:29.460 align:start position:0%
never been presented with this that
 
00:36:31.550 --> 00:36:31.560 align:start position:0%
version of it I would have to do some
 
00:36:33.950 --> 00:36:33.960 align:start position:0%
research I would also say that based on
 
00:36:35.150 --> 00:36:35.160 align:start position:0%
the beginning of your question if you
 
00:36:37.609 --> 00:36:37.619 align:start position:0%
had that much trouble with the entity
 
00:36:38.690 --> 00:36:38.700 align:start position:0%
um you're welcome to file a complaint
 
00:36:40.849 --> 00:36:40.859 align:start position:0%
with us and we would look into it
 
00:36:43.069 --> 00:36:43.079 align:start position:0%
um that's that's that would be my advice
 
00:36:44.450 --> 00:36:44.460 align:start position:0%
and then we could do a deeper dive into
 
00:36:44.460 --> 00:36:45.589 align:start position:0%
and then we could do a deeper dive into
it

00:36:45.589 --> 00:36:45.599 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:36:48.650 --> 00:36:48.660 align:start position:0%
um but off the top of my head I'm I'm
 
00:36:50.930 --> 00:36:50.940 align:start position:0%
not sure this statute applies to State
 
00:36:53.810 --> 00:36:53.820 align:start position:0%

00:37:41.030 --> 00:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
having me introducing the bill would be
 
00:37:43.010 --> 00:37:43.020 align:start position:0%
a waste of time
 
00:37:46.609 --> 00:37:46.619 align:start position:0%

00:38:22.130 --> 00:38:22.140 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the opportunity to
 
00:38:24.890 --> 00:38:24.900 align:start position:0%
testify this morning regarding HB 522
 
00:38:26.630 --> 00:38:26.640 align:start position:0%
this is an act relative to money
 
00:38:30.170 --> 00:38:30.180 align:start position:0%
transmitters this bill was drafted uh by
 
00:38:32.210 --> 00:38:32.220 align:start position:0%
the banking Department staff and we
 
00:38:35.089 --> 00:38:35.099 align:start position:0%
sought sponsorship for this bill
 
00:38:40.490 --> 00:38:40.500 align:start position:0%
uh HB 522 adds nine exemptions into New
 
00:38:43.010 --> 00:38:43.020 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law from What's called the
 
00:38:45.650 --> 00:38:45.660 align:start position:0%
model money transmission modernization
 
00:38:45.660 --> 00:38:46.609 align:start position:0%
model money transmission modernization
Act

00:38:46.609 --> 00:38:46.619 align:start position:0%
Act
 
00:38:49.130 --> 00:38:49.140 align:start position:0%
so before getting into the details I
 
00:38:50.329 --> 00:38:50.339 align:start position:0%
think it'd be helpful for me to give
 
00:38:53.390 --> 00:38:53.400 align:start position:0%
some general background about money
 
00:38:55.190 --> 00:38:55.200 align:start position:0%
transmitter regulation so what's a money
 
00:38:57.349 --> 00:38:57.359 align:start position:0%
transmitter under current state law
 
00:38:59.510 --> 00:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
money transmitters are companies that
 
00:39:01.370 --> 00:39:01.380 align:start position:0%
receive money for transmission to
 
00:39:04.190 --> 00:39:04.200 align:start position:0%
another location or sell or issue
 
00:39:07.250 --> 00:39:07.260 align:start position:0%
payment instruments or stored value
 
00:39:09.710 --> 00:39:09.720 align:start position:0%
persons who are who are engaged in the
 
00:39:11.089 --> 00:39:11.099 align:start position:0%
non-exempt business of money
 
00:39:11.099 --> 00:39:12.890 align:start position:0%
non-exempt business of money
transmission

00:39:12.890 --> 00:39:12.900 align:start position:0%
transmission
 
00:39:12.900 --> 00:39:13.790 align:start position:0%
transmission
um

00:39:13.790 --> 00:39:13.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:15.470 --> 00:39:15.480 align:start position:0%
are subject to the banking Department's
 
00:39:17.930 --> 00:39:17.940 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction and regulation
 
00:39:19.730 --> 00:39:19.740 align:start position:0%
now money transmitters that may be
 
00:39:21.829 --> 00:39:21.839 align:start position:0%
familiar to you would include Western
 
00:39:25.370 --> 00:39:25.380 align:start position:0%
Union Moneygram PayPal that's just to
 
00:39:26.930 --> 00:39:26.940 align:start position:0%
name a few of the Departments
 
00:39:30.250 --> 00:39:30.260 align:start position:0%
approximately 175 licensees
 
00:39:32.750 --> 00:39:32.760 align:start position:0%
many of these companies are nationwide
 
00:39:35.810 --> 00:39:35.820 align:start position:0%
some are Global and and there are some
 
00:39:37.910 --> 00:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
that are Regional uh the money
 
00:39:39.950 --> 00:39:39.960 align:start position:0%
transmitter industry has shown
 
00:39:41.870 --> 00:39:41.880 align:start position:0%
significant growth both in transmission
 
00:39:44.930 --> 00:39:44.940 align:start position:0%
volume and in the variety of companies
 
00:39:46.849 --> 00:39:46.859 align:start position:0%
that operate in this space
 
00:39:49.069 --> 00:39:49.079 align:start position:0%
nationally operating companies have more
 
00:39:51.530 --> 00:39:51.540 align:start position:0%
than doubled since 2015 and this is
 
00:39:53.329 --> 00:39:53.339 align:start position:0%
largely driven by the Boom in what we
 
00:39:56.390 --> 00:39:56.400 align:start position:0%
call fintech payment providers
 
00:39:58.250 --> 00:39:58.260 align:start position:0%
so what does all this mean New
 
00:39:59.870 --> 00:39:59.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's money transmitter law is due
 
00:40:01.849 --> 00:40:01.859 align:start position:0%
for modernization when a company
 
00:40:03.829 --> 00:40:03.839 align:start position:0%
operates in all 50 states you can
 
00:40:06.109 --> 00:40:06.119 align:start position:0%
imagine the burden that it creates on
 
00:40:08.150 --> 00:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
the company when they have to operate
 
00:40:10.490 --> 00:40:10.500 align:start position:0%
under a patchwork of 50 different state
 
00:40:13.430 --> 00:40:13.440 align:start position:0%
statute statutory regimes and variations
 
00:40:14.569 --> 00:40:14.579 align:start position:0%
in the law
 
00:40:16.730 --> 00:40:16.740 align:start position:0%
so bringing We Believe bringing
 
00:40:18.770 --> 00:40:18.780 align:start position:0%
uniformities to the state laws in this
 
00:40:20.750 --> 00:40:20.760 align:start position:0%
area is better for business it's better
 
00:40:22.310 --> 00:40:22.320 align:start position:0%
for the regulators and it's ultimately
 
00:40:24.349 --> 00:40:24.359 align:start position:0%
better for the consumers
 
00:40:24.359 --> 00:40:25.670 align:start position:0%
better for the consumers
so

00:40:25.670 --> 00:40:25.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:40:28.910 --> 00:40:28.920 align:start position:0%
um let me talk about the the the what I
 
00:40:30.890 --> 00:40:30.900 align:start position:0%
refer to as the model money transmission
 
00:40:33.589 --> 00:40:33.599 align:start position:0%
modernization act and this is where the
 
00:40:36.349 --> 00:40:36.359 align:start position:0%
exemptions that are in our bill that's
 
00:40:39.050 --> 00:40:39.060 align:start position:0%
where they come from so the model law
 
00:40:41.630 --> 00:40:41.640 align:start position:0%
was developed by a joint working group
 
00:40:44.530 --> 00:40:44.540 align:start position:0%
of State regulators and Industry experts
 
00:40:47.270 --> 00:40:47.280 align:start position:0%
and it the the purpose of it is to set
 
00:40:49.609 --> 00:40:49.619 align:start position:0%
Nationwide standards and requirements
 
00:40:52.130 --> 00:40:52.140 align:start position:0%
for money transmission that are designed
 
00:40:54.290 --> 00:40:54.300 align:start position:0%
to protect consumers and also enable
 
00:40:56.990 --> 00:40:57.000 align:start position:0%
local innovation
 
00:40:59.329 --> 00:40:59.339 align:start position:0%
um the standardization of exemptions
 
00:41:01.550 --> 00:41:01.560 align:start position:0%
from money transmitter licensing will
 
00:41:03.290 --> 00:41:03.300 align:start position:0%
promote consistency among the states
 
00:41:05.450 --> 00:41:05.460 align:start position:0%
it'll make it easier for companies to
 
00:41:08.089 --> 00:41:08.099 align:start position:0%
operate in multiple multiple States and
 
00:41:10.310 --> 00:41:10.320 align:start position:0%
it will also make it uh easier for State
 
00:41:13.069 --> 00:41:13.079 align:start position:0%
Regulators to leverage common practices
 
00:41:16.250 --> 00:41:16.260 align:start position:0%
and Analysis the common standards will
 
00:41:18.589 --> 00:41:18.599 align:start position:0%
eliminate unnecessary barriers barriers
 
00:41:20.690 --> 00:41:20.700 align:start position:0%
to interstate commerce they will
 
00:41:23.030 --> 00:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
eliminate inconsistency across the state
 
00:41:25.430 --> 00:41:25.440 align:start position:0%
regulatory regimes and they will protect
 
00:41:27.710 --> 00:41:27.720 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's interests against the
 
00:41:29.990 --> 00:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
threat of federal preemption in this
 
00:41:33.470 --> 00:41:33.480 align:start position:0%
area so this this the idea is to keep
 
00:41:35.329 --> 00:41:35.339 align:start position:0%
accountability for money transmitters at
 
00:41:37.190 --> 00:41:37.200 align:start position:0%
the state level
 
00:41:40.010 --> 00:41:40.020 align:start position:0%
um HB 522 this bill represents New
 
00:41:41.930 --> 00:41:41.940 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's first step in implementing
 
00:41:44.930 --> 00:41:44.940 align:start position:0%
the model law so this exemptions these
 
00:41:46.609 --> 00:41:46.619 align:start position:0%
these exempt these additional exemptions
 
00:41:49.550 --> 00:41:49.560 align:start position:0%
that we are seeking to add into our law
 
00:41:51.950 --> 00:41:51.960 align:start position:0%
um are are a small our piece of the
 
00:41:53.630 --> 00:41:53.640 align:start position:0%
model law or the although they're a
 
00:41:55.430 --> 00:41:55.440 align:start position:0%
significant piece for industry and
 
00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:56.870 align:start position:0%
significant piece for industry and
Regulators

00:41:56.870 --> 00:41:56.880 align:start position:0%
Regulators
 
00:42:00.050 --> 00:42:00.060 align:start position:0%
um and I think in next year the banking
 
00:42:02.390 --> 00:42:02.400 align:start position:0%
Department intends to incorporate a much
 
00:42:05.630 --> 00:42:05.640 align:start position:0%
broader swath of the model law
 
00:42:07.430 --> 00:42:07.440 align:start position:0%
um and that will be next year we we
 
00:42:10.370 --> 00:42:10.380 align:start position:0%
decided this year to focus on this piece
 
00:42:11.750 --> 00:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
since it was important to the industry
 
00:42:14.089 --> 00:42:14.099 align:start position:0%
and regulators and take undertake that
 
00:42:15.349 --> 00:42:15.359 align:start position:0%
larger effort
 
00:42:17.930 --> 00:42:17.940 align:start position:0%
um next year so
 
00:42:21.170 --> 00:42:21.180 align:start position:0%
um HP 522 it specifically adds nine
 
00:42:23.150 --> 00:42:23.160 align:start position:0%
separate exemptions to our money
 
00:42:25.370 --> 00:42:25.380 align:start position:0%
transmitter law as a general matter
 
00:42:27.290 --> 00:42:27.300 align:start position:0%
these new exemptions have two common
 
00:42:29.690 --> 00:42:29.700 align:start position:0%
themes the first is they provide
 
00:42:31.250 --> 00:42:31.260 align:start position:0%
exemptions and situations where
 
00:42:33.530 --> 00:42:33.540 align:start position:0%
consumers upon sending their funds
 
00:42:35.870 --> 00:42:35.880 align:start position:0%
they're no longer liable to the ultimate
 
00:42:38.270 --> 00:42:38.280 align:start position:0%
intended recipient of the funds if those
 
00:42:40.490 --> 00:42:40.500 align:start position:0%
funds are never received and then the
 
00:42:42.410 --> 00:42:42.420 align:start position:0%
second piece is they provide exemptions
 
00:42:44.630 --> 00:42:44.640 align:start position:0%
for entities that are regulated under
 
00:42:47.089 --> 00:42:47.099 align:start position:0%
federal law you know one of the
 
00:42:49.430 --> 00:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
exemptions is for the the USPS the U.S
 
00:42:52.190 --> 00:42:52.200 align:start position:0%
the U.S Postal Service
 
00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:53.030 align:start position:0%
the U.S Postal Service
um

00:42:53.030 --> 00:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:54.950 --> 00:42:54.960 align:start position:0%
so um I
 
00:42:56.870 --> 00:42:56.880 align:start position:0%
in the bottom half of the handout I go
 
00:42:58.730 --> 00:42:58.740 align:start position:0%
through uh there's there's a description
 
00:43:01.069 --> 00:43:01.079 align:start position:0%
of each of the nine exemptions in some
 
00:43:03.589 --> 00:43:03.599 align:start position:0%
detail so I I'd refer you to that for
 
00:43:05.150 --> 00:43:05.160 align:start position:0%
the sort of the technical details of the
 
00:43:06.890 --> 00:43:06.900 align:start position:0%
name exemptions
 
00:43:08.270 --> 00:43:08.280 align:start position:0%
um and thank you for consideration of
 
00:43:09.950 --> 00:43:09.960 align:start position:0%
this bill and I'd be happy to answer any
 
00:43:12.410 --> 00:43:12.420 align:start position:0%
questions you may have
 
00:43:15.170 --> 00:43:15.180 align:start position:0%
but yes representative Herbert
 
00:43:17.510 --> 00:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
um is this
 
00:43:20.690 --> 00:43:20.700 align:start position:0%
I've been uh is this part of the
 
00:43:22.849 --> 00:43:22.859 align:start position:0%
what's the organization and you you see
 
00:43:26.150 --> 00:43:26.160 align:start position:0%
no that would be insurance would be coil
 
00:43:29.750 --> 00:43:29.760 align:start position:0%
but it has a similar entity but so this
 
00:43:31.609 --> 00:43:31.619 align:start position:0%
was developed by What's called the
 
00:43:33.589 --> 00:43:33.599 align:start position:0%
conference of State Bank supervisors in
 
00:43:35.870 --> 00:43:35.880 align:start position:0%
connection with with industry um so it's
 
00:43:39.230 --> 00:43:39.240 align:start position:0%
the csbs I think we were we we spoke a
 
00:43:40.910 --> 00:43:40.920 align:start position:0%
little bit about the csbs at one of the
 
00:43:43.910 --> 00:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
uh the orientations session um with this
 
00:43:45.589 --> 00:43:45.599 align:start position:0%
committee all right
 
00:43:47.210 --> 00:43:47.220 align:start position:0%
different than the uniform law committee
 
00:43:49.490 --> 00:43:49.500 align:start position:0%
the uniform lock or commission I can't
 
00:43:50.630 --> 00:43:50.640 align:start position:0%
remember it's a committee or commission
 
00:43:53.150 --> 00:43:53.160 align:start position:0%
they're the ones who developed the UCC
 
00:43:53.160 --> 00:43:54.130 align:start position:0%
they're the ones who developed the UCC
um

00:43:54.130 --> 00:43:54.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:57.710 --> 00:43:57.720 align:start position:0%
this is a different entity yep
 
00:44:00.230 --> 00:44:00.240 align:start position:0%
right but it's more like coil you know
 
00:44:02.750 --> 00:44:02.760 align:start position:0%
Council of insurance legislators or or
 
00:44:05.569 --> 00:44:05.579 align:start position:0%
not Quail but uh ins and natural
 
00:44:08.510 --> 00:44:08.520 align:start position:0%
associate of insurance commissioner NAIC
 
00:44:10.609 --> 00:44:10.619 align:start position:0%
has the commissioner they do it at that
 
00:44:12.829 --> 00:44:12.839 align:start position:0%
level they do I think that's correct I'm
 
00:44:14.150 --> 00:44:14.160 align:start position:0%
not so familiar with the insurance
 
00:44:16.609 --> 00:44:16.619 align:start position:0%
version right
 
00:44:19.670 --> 00:44:19.680 align:start position:0%
okay yes representative oh thank you I
 
00:44:22.069 --> 00:44:22.079 align:start position:0%
would say that I'm I'm breaking our
 
00:44:24.349 --> 00:44:24.359 align:start position:0%
rules to letting you and I testify on
 
00:44:25.790 --> 00:44:25.800 align:start position:0%
this bill like questions questions
 
00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:28.309 align:start position:0%
this bill like questions questions
exactly

00:44:28.309 --> 00:44:28.319 align:start position:0%
exactly
 
00:44:30.530 --> 00:44:30.540 align:start position:0%
um my question is this as I read but you
 
00:44:32.210 --> 00:44:32.220 align:start position:0%
didn't testify that's why you're allowed
 
00:44:32.220 --> 00:44:32.930 align:start position:0%
didn't testify that's why you're allowed
to

00:44:32.930 --> 00:44:32.940 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:44:36.230 --> 00:44:36.240 align:start position:0%
yeah as I'm reading this as I read the
 
00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:37.670 align:start position:0%
yeah as I'm reading this as I read the
bill

00:44:37.670 --> 00:44:37.680 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:44:40.309 --> 00:44:40.319 align:start position:0%
um it seemed to me that you could have
 
00:44:40.319 --> 00:44:41.290 align:start position:0%
um it seemed to me that you could have
a

00:44:41.290 --> 00:44:41.300 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:44:44.569 --> 00:44:44.579 align:start position:0%
organization or a money transfer who is
 
00:44:47.329 --> 00:44:47.339 align:start position:0%
exempt on this much of his business but
 
00:44:50.150 --> 00:44:50.160 align:start position:0%
not exempt on that if that's the case to
 
00:44:52.809 --> 00:44:52.819 align:start position:0%
the only report on the business they're
 
00:44:55.190 --> 00:44:55.200 align:start position:0%
non-exempt from or does that make them
 
00:44:58.490 --> 00:44:58.500 align:start position:0%
cover the exempt as well
 
00:45:01.190 --> 00:45:01.200 align:start position:0%
uh yeah we will only regulate the
 
00:45:03.530 --> 00:45:03.540 align:start position:0%
non-exempt portion of their business got
 
00:45:06.230 --> 00:45:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:09.829 --> 00:45:09.839 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
00:45:11.990 --> 00:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you is there
 
00:45:13.609 --> 00:45:13.619 align:start position:0%
anybody else here would like to testify
 
00:45:17.030 --> 00:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 522
 
00:45:19.970 --> 00:45:19.980 align:start position:0%
see none it will close the public
 
00:45:19.980 --> 00:45:33.530 align:start position:0%
see none it will close the public
hearing

00:45:33.530 --> 00:45:33.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:35.990 --> 00:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
so for the next bill anybody who wants
 
00:46:57.230 --> 00:46:57.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:59.870 --> 00:46:59.880 align:start position:0%
okay we'll open up the public hearing on
 
00:47:02.630 --> 00:47:02.640 align:start position:0%
the house bill 595 and hear from our
 
00:47:06.410 --> 00:47:06.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:06.420 --> 00:47:12.890 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:47:12.890 --> 00:47:12.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:14.990 --> 00:47:15.000 align:start position:0%
good morning again for the record my
 
00:47:16.430 --> 00:47:16.440 align:start position:0%
name is Amelia galderi I'm the bank
 
00:47:17.569 --> 00:47:17.579 align:start position:0%
commissioner for this day of New
 
00:47:19.970 --> 00:47:19.980 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I don't have anything super
 
00:47:21.950 --> 00:47:21.960 align:start position:0%
prepared for this we're neutral on this
 
00:47:23.510 --> 00:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
bill I just wanted to make myself
 
00:47:25.309 --> 00:47:25.319 align:start position:0%
available to answer any questions you
 
00:47:28.370 --> 00:47:28.380 align:start position:0%
may have this was drafted as a result I
 
00:47:31.190 --> 00:47:31.200 align:start position:0%
believe of a study committee from last
 
00:47:33.050 --> 00:47:33.060 align:start position:0%
year and this was the recommendation
 
00:47:35.450 --> 00:47:35.460 align:start position:0%
from it I would point out
 
00:47:39.050 --> 00:47:39.060 align:start position:0%
um that there is a slight issue with it
 
00:47:41.270 --> 00:47:41.280 align:start position:0%
um they basically how this how this got
 
00:47:43.130 --> 00:47:43.140 align:start position:0%
drafted I imagine is it got lifted out
 
00:47:45.050 --> 00:47:45.060 align:start position:0%
of the bank commissioner's law and is
 
00:47:47.450 --> 00:47:47.460 align:start position:0%
now being placed under the treasurer's
 
00:47:49.309 --> 00:47:49.319 align:start position:0%
um State treasure yeah jurisdiction
 
00:47:49.319 --> 00:47:50.750 align:start position:0%
um State treasure yeah jurisdiction
however

00:47:50.750 --> 00:47:50.760 align:start position:0%
however
 
00:47:52.849 --> 00:47:52.859 align:start position:0%
um when they did that lift they left in
 
00:47:55.970 --> 00:47:55.980 align:start position:0%
a reference to our costs so we have a
 
00:47:58.130 --> 00:47:58.140 align:start position:0%
provision under current law that allows
 
00:48:00.230 --> 00:48:00.240 align:start position:0%
us to charge the pool for banking
 
00:48:01.970 --> 00:48:01.980 align:start position:0%
Department's costs in administering the
 
00:48:05.390 --> 00:48:05.400 align:start position:0%
pool and that reference is on sorry I
 
00:48:06.530 --> 00:48:06.540 align:start position:0%
should have had it right at my
 
00:48:09.710 --> 00:48:09.720 align:start position:0%
fingertips but it's uh I think it's at
 
00:48:12.470 --> 00:48:12.480 align:start position:0%
the end I was repealing a bunch of stuff
 
00:48:16.550 --> 00:48:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:18.609 align:start position:0%
 
22.

00:48:18.609 --> 00:48:18.619 align:start position:0%
22.
 
00:48:20.990 --> 00:48:21.000 align:start position:0%
on page one
 
00:48:22.790 --> 00:48:22.800 align:start position:0%
yeah page one
 
00:48:27.710 --> 00:48:27.720 align:start position:0%
um of the bill line 22. RSA 3 83 11. so
 
00:48:29.210 --> 00:48:29.220 align:start position:0%
that would need to be changed because
 
00:48:31.970 --> 00:48:31.980 align:start position:0%
that's our that's how we calculate our
 
00:48:34.130 --> 00:48:34.140 align:start position:0%
per diem rate and I'd imagine the state
 
00:48:36.170 --> 00:48:36.180 align:start position:0%
treasurer has a different way that she
 
00:48:38.390 --> 00:48:38.400 align:start position:0%
would like her cost factored in okay um
 
00:48:40.190 --> 00:48:40.200 align:start position:0%
but other than that that's just more of
 
00:48:42.170 --> 00:48:42.180 align:start position:0%
a technical issue
 
00:48:42.180 --> 00:48:43.190 align:start position:0%
a technical issue
um

00:48:43.190 --> 00:48:43.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:45.109 --> 00:48:45.119 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to answer any questions
 
00:48:48.829 --> 00:48:48.839 align:start position:0%
about the representative spear
 
00:48:51.470 --> 00:48:51.480 align:start position:0%
I think I'm on the right bill this time
 
00:48:55.430 --> 00:48:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:57.410 --> 00:48:57.420 align:start position:0%
in reading this and I don't know the
 
00:48:59.510 --> 00:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
history but in reading this I looked up
 
00:49:02.569 --> 00:49:02.579 align:start position:0%
the account that it's in and it's a AAA
 
00:49:04.609 --> 00:49:04.619 align:start position:0%
rated account so it's apparently managed
 
00:49:07.670 --> 00:49:07.680 align:start position:0%
very well or at least very safely
 
00:49:11.329 --> 00:49:11.339 align:start position:0%
and into the account goes money from all
 
00:49:13.550 --> 00:49:13.560 align:start position:0%
kinds of municipalities and all sorts of
 
00:49:16.430 --> 00:49:16.440 align:start position:0%
things that go into this uh oh I forgot
 
00:49:18.410 --> 00:49:18.420 align:start position:0%
the name public deposit investment pool
 
00:49:20.150 --> 00:49:20.160 align:start position:0%
the investment pool
 
00:49:22.550 --> 00:49:22.560 align:start position:0%
and now what we're suggesting in this
 
00:49:24.710 --> 00:49:24.720 align:start position:0%
bill is to put it under the state
 
00:49:29.390 --> 00:49:29.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:31.870 --> 00:49:31.880 align:start position:0%
as opposed to the banking
 
00:49:34.190 --> 00:49:34.200 align:start position:0%
commission which is where it was managed
 
00:49:36.050 --> 00:49:36.060 align:start position:0%
up to now and doing well
 
00:49:38.750 --> 00:49:38.760 align:start position:0%
why are we doing that so generally
 
00:49:41.089 --> 00:49:41.099 align:start position:0%
broadly speaking we testified to this
 
00:49:42.950 --> 00:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
before the study committee so the
 
00:49:44.930 --> 00:49:44.940 align:start position:0%
banking department is a regulatory
 
00:49:47.750 --> 00:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
agency what we specialize in is going
 
00:49:49.790 --> 00:49:49.800 align:start position:0%
into entities and examining them and
 
00:49:50.990 --> 00:49:51.000 align:start position:0%
determining whether they're complying
 
00:49:52.670 --> 00:49:52.680 align:start position:0%
with laws rules and safety and soundness
 
00:49:56.030 --> 00:49:56.040 align:start position:0%
regulations we're not in like we're not
 
00:49:57.710 --> 00:49:57.720 align:start position:0%
investment advisors although sometimes
 
00:50:00.470 --> 00:50:00.480 align:start position:0%
our paths cross with them and I think
 
00:50:04.190 --> 00:50:04.200 align:start position:0%
that um the better person to handle
 
00:50:06.410 --> 00:50:06.420 align:start position:0%
these is the state treasurer because
 
00:50:08.390 --> 00:50:08.400 align:start position:0%
that's more their area of expertise just
 
00:50:10.069 --> 00:50:10.079 align:start position:0%
from a high level there's all sorts of
 
00:50:11.690 --> 00:50:11.700 align:start position:0%
nitty-gritty other reasons that I could
 
00:50:13.370 --> 00:50:13.380 align:start position:0%
give you but I think that in my mind is
 
00:50:16.130 --> 00:50:16.140 align:start position:0%
the biggest highest level additionally
 
00:50:19.309 --> 00:50:19.319 align:start position:0%
um there's an element where Banks stage
 
00:50:20.809 --> 00:50:20.819 align:start position:0%
hard banks that are regulated by the
 
00:50:22.550 --> 00:50:22.560 align:start position:0%
bank commissioner
 
00:50:24.410 --> 00:50:24.420 align:start position:0%
um compete with the pool for these
 
00:50:26.990 --> 00:50:27.000 align:start position:0%
deposits and so that creates a conflict
 
00:50:28.609 --> 00:50:28.619 align:start position:0%
for me as the bank commissioner because
 
00:50:30.710 --> 00:50:30.720 align:start position:0%
on one hand I have to sort of promote
 
00:50:33.170 --> 00:50:33.180 align:start position:0%
this pool and then on the other hand
 
00:50:34.910 --> 00:50:34.920 align:start position:0%
ensure the safety and soundness of these
 
00:50:37.130 --> 00:50:37.140 align:start position:0%
entities that are competing with it
 
00:50:39.290 --> 00:50:39.300 align:start position:0%
um it's just a little strange
 
00:50:40.730 --> 00:50:40.740 align:start position:0%
um so I think it's a better fit under
 
00:50:42.890 --> 00:50:42.900 align:start position:0%
the state treasurer right that as a
 
00:50:44.750 --> 00:50:44.760 align:start position:0%
member of this of the over the study
 
00:50:49.569 --> 00:50:49.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:52.730 --> 00:50:52.740 align:start position:0%
I agree with that point exactly as I was
 
00:50:54.230 --> 00:50:54.240 align:start position:0%
reading through this it seemed to me
 
00:50:55.970 --> 00:50:55.980 align:start position:0%
that there had to be a little bit of
 
00:50:58.549 --> 00:50:58.559 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest if banks
 
00:51:02.150 --> 00:51:02.160 align:start position:0%
um but going back on this does this did
 
00:51:04.549 --> 00:51:04.559 align:start position:0%
this is this taking place because a few
 
00:51:08.329 --> 00:51:08.339 align:start position:0%
years ago they allowed the uh this
 
00:51:12.589 --> 00:51:12.599 align:start position:0%
investment pool to go beyond uh fixed
 
00:51:16.609 --> 00:51:16.619 align:start position:0%
income and so now they're looking for uh
 
00:51:18.650 --> 00:51:18.660 align:start position:0%
maybe and it also said investment
 
00:51:21.109 --> 00:51:21.119 align:start position:0%
advisor it didn't talk about multiple
 
00:51:23.510 --> 00:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
advisors and I was a little concerned
 
00:51:25.730 --> 00:51:25.740 align:start position:0%
about that that they couldn't hire you
 
00:51:26.870 --> 00:51:26.880 align:start position:0%
know two or three or four different
 
00:51:28.849 --> 00:51:28.859 align:start position:0%
investment advisors to handle different
 
00:51:28.859 --> 00:51:33.230 align:start position:0%
investment advisors to handle different
sectors

00:51:33.230 --> 00:51:33.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:35.530 --> 00:51:35.540 align:start position:0%
part of your question I'm not quite sure
 
00:51:39.230 --> 00:51:39.240 align:start position:0%
the pool was set up in 1991 I think that
 
00:51:42.890 --> 00:51:42.900 align:start position:0%
given I was not around at that time but
 
00:51:46.309 --> 00:51:46.319 align:start position:0%
given the um economic situation I think
 
00:51:48.650 --> 00:51:48.660 align:start position:0%
there was concern that
 
00:51:51.650 --> 00:51:51.660 align:start position:0%
um public deposits be have this option
 
00:51:54.230 --> 00:51:54.240 align:start position:0%
available public municipalities and so
 
00:51:55.309 --> 00:51:55.319 align:start position:0%
on and so forth the entities of the
 
00:51:57.349 --> 00:51:57.359 align:start position:0%
deposit into the pool have this option
 
00:52:00.349 --> 00:52:00.359 align:start position:0%
to safely deposit their funds I believe
 
00:52:03.170 --> 00:52:03.180 align:start position:0%
that's in a nutshell the history
 
00:52:05.390 --> 00:52:05.400 align:start position:0%
um and then there is just one investment
 
00:52:06.950 --> 00:52:06.960 align:start position:0%
advisor that's how it's set up by the
 
00:52:10.130 --> 00:52:10.140 align:start position:0%
statute we do an RFP every five or ten
 
00:52:11.690 --> 00:52:11.700 align:start position:0%
years I can't quite remember whatever it
 
00:52:13.730 --> 00:52:13.740 align:start position:0%
says in the statute to make sure that we
 
00:52:13.740 --> 00:52:14.510 align:start position:0%
says in the statute to make sure that we
have

00:52:14.510 --> 00:52:14.520 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:52:17.750 --> 00:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
um a investment advisor who can handle
 
00:52:21.170 --> 00:52:21.180 align:start position:0%
the fun follow the question main choir
 
00:52:23.089 --> 00:52:23.099 align:start position:0%
do you know who the investment advisor
 
00:52:25.849 --> 00:52:25.859 align:start position:0%
is at this point it's on pfm
 
00:52:28.490 --> 00:52:28.500 align:start position:0%
um and they've been doing it pursuant to
 
00:52:30.770 --> 00:52:30.780 align:start position:0%
the RFP they won the bid and they've
 
00:52:32.930 --> 00:52:32.940 align:start position:0%
been managing it now for I think a long
 
00:52:35.510 --> 00:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
time a long time yeah 10 years eight I
 
00:52:36.710 --> 00:52:36.720 align:start position:0%
I've done
 
00:52:38.270 --> 00:52:38.280 align:start position:0%
but I've been at the bank department for
 
00:52:39.770 --> 00:52:39.780 align:start position:0%
10 years and it's been them basically
 
00:52:41.809 --> 00:52:41.819 align:start position:0%
the whole time someone's here to
 
00:52:48.170 --> 00:52:48.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:50.450 --> 00:52:50.460 align:start position:0%
that it was cut water an entity called
 
00:52:52.069 --> 00:52:52.079 align:start position:0%
cut water was the investment advisor
 
00:52:53.390 --> 00:52:53.400 align:start position:0%
you've just different to follow up but
 
00:52:57.170 --> 00:52:57.180 align:start position:0%
my question is I believe that that at
 
00:52:59.210 --> 00:52:59.220 align:start position:0%
the time they took this over it was
 
00:53:01.010 --> 00:53:01.020 align:start position:0%
basically under the what we'll call it
 
00:53:03.410 --> 00:53:03.420 align:start position:0%
the prudent man rule and now I think
 
00:53:06.589 --> 00:53:06.599 align:start position:0%
it's under the prudent investment uh
 
00:53:08.870 --> 00:53:08.880 align:start position:0%
investor which allows these
 
00:53:11.990 --> 00:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities to uh to invest more
 
00:53:14.390 --> 00:53:14.400 align:start position:0%
aggressively so for example I'm a
 
00:53:16.630 --> 00:53:16.640 align:start position:0%
trustee of the trust funds in in Jackson
 
00:53:19.309 --> 00:53:19.319 align:start position:0%
and when I came on there that this is
 
00:53:22.730 --> 00:53:22.740 align:start position:0%
all they had and they were earning 0.38
 
00:53:26.630 --> 00:53:26.640 align:start position:0%
and so we moved to a uh took out the
 
00:53:28.430 --> 00:53:28.440 align:start position:0%
money out of there and put it with an
 
00:53:31.430 --> 00:53:31.440 align:start position:0%
investment advisor and now we're we're
 
00:53:34.309 --> 00:53:34.319 align:start position:0%
investing in stocks and all that stuff
 
00:53:37.849 --> 00:53:37.859 align:start position:0%
so I I thought that they had this com
 
00:53:41.390 --> 00:53:41.400 align:start position:0%
this pool had the option to do that and
 
00:53:44.329 --> 00:53:44.339 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm trying to find out
 
00:53:48.290 --> 00:53:48.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:49.730 --> 00:53:49.740 align:start position:0%
talking about and I'll have to think
 
00:53:51.650 --> 00:53:51.660 align:start position:0%
about this a little bit more so
 
00:53:55.309 --> 00:53:55.319 align:start position:0%
um bear with me I think that where a
 
00:53:57.950 --> 00:53:57.960 align:start position:0%
town can invest their funds say use a
 
00:53:59.270 --> 00:53:59.280 align:start position:0%
town as an example there's all sorts of
 
00:54:00.950 --> 00:54:00.960 align:start position:0%
entities that might be depositing money
 
00:54:04.549 --> 00:54:04.559 align:start position:0%
in the pool but where a town for example
 
00:54:06.290 --> 00:54:06.300 align:start position:0%
can invest its funds is governed by
 
00:54:08.210 --> 00:54:08.220 align:start position:0%
another statute altogether that's not
 
00:54:09.530 --> 00:54:09.540 align:start position:0%
under my jurisdiction I think it's an
 
00:54:12.650 --> 00:54:12.660 align:start position:0%
RSA 21. I want to say or seven it's a
 
00:54:14.630 --> 00:54:14.640 align:start position:0%
low number RSA yeah
 
00:54:17.990 --> 00:54:18.000 align:start position:0%
um local government okay
 
00:54:20.809 --> 00:54:20.819 align:start position:0%
um and that that sets out a variety of
 
00:54:24.049 --> 00:54:24.059 align:start position:0%
investment options for towns with their
 
00:54:25.609 --> 00:54:25.619 align:start position:0%
funds so I think that's what you're
 
00:54:28.609 --> 00:54:28.619 align:start position:0%
getting at not necessarily this
 
00:54:30.950 --> 00:54:30.960 align:start position:0%
um but I could be misunderstanding I
 
00:54:33.349 --> 00:54:33.359 align:start position:0%
apologize we will be taking this home in
 
00:54:35.210 --> 00:54:35.220 align:start position:0%
subcommittee so you can pursue this yeah
 
00:54:38.210 --> 00:54:38.220 align:start position:0%
and please like
 
00:54:39.530 --> 00:54:39.540 align:start position:0%
talk about your question so I can be
 
00:54:41.270 --> 00:54:41.280 align:start position:0%
sure to get you an answer thank you so
 
00:54:43.490 --> 00:54:43.500 align:start position:0%
uh I have no more cards to say treasure
 
00:54:45.770 --> 00:54:45.780 align:start position:0%
would you like to testify at all or and
 
00:54:48.049 --> 00:54:48.059 align:start position:0%
it's it's an honor to have you here and
 
00:55:03.770 --> 00:55:03.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:07.730 --> 00:55:07.740 align:start position:0%
not going to crucify because my only um
 
00:55:10.670 --> 00:55:10.680 align:start position:0%
my only comment was uh pointing out that
 
00:55:13.970 --> 00:55:13.980 align:start position:0%
technical defect of the bill other than
 
00:55:16.190 --> 00:55:16.200 align:start position:0%
that the state treasury doesn't take a
 
00:55:18.829 --> 00:55:18.839 align:start position:0%
position we will simply follow the
 
00:55:20.569 --> 00:55:20.579 align:start position:0%
direction of the legislature in this
 
00:55:20.579 --> 00:55:21.710 align:start position:0%
direction of the legislature in this
case

00:55:21.710 --> 00:55:21.720 align:start position:0%
case
 
00:55:23.809 --> 00:55:23.819 align:start position:0%
um the only comment I will I will add to
 
00:55:26.390 --> 00:55:26.400 align:start position:0%
that is that again we will be willing to
 
00:55:29.930 --> 00:55:29.940 align:start position:0%
to administer uh the pool
 
00:55:29.940 --> 00:55:31.010 align:start position:0%
to administer uh the pool
um

00:55:31.010 --> 00:55:31.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:33.410 --> 00:55:33.420 align:start position:0%
if it comes to us great and do you know
 
00:55:36.170 --> 00:55:36.180 align:start position:0%
what the correct RSA should be we don't
 
00:55:38.510 --> 00:55:38.520 align:start position:0%
really have a specific methodology the
 
00:55:41.990 --> 00:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
way that banking department does so we
 
00:55:44.870 --> 00:55:44.880 align:start position:0%
will simply track our time and also we
 
00:55:46.609 --> 00:55:46.619 align:start position:0%
will learn how much of our
 
00:55:49.609 --> 00:55:49.619 align:start position:0%
Administration will take so um again
 
00:55:51.530 --> 00:55:51.540 align:start position:0%
we'll simply just track our time and
 
00:55:53.270 --> 00:55:53.280 align:start position:0%
perhaps charge the pool based on that
 
00:55:54.829 --> 00:55:54.839 align:start position:0%
right so we're going to just delete
 
00:55:57.410 --> 00:55:57.420 align:start position:0%
after the word uh per diem examination
 
00:56:01.150 --> 00:56:01.160 align:start position:0%
charge delete established in the RSA
 
00:56:05.890 --> 00:56:05.900 align:start position:0%
3831 colon eleven one right just
 
00:56:08.630 --> 00:56:08.640 align:start position:0%
provided the requirement the cost of
 
00:56:11.089 --> 00:56:11.099 align:start position:0%
personnel assistant through
 
00:56:14.329 --> 00:56:14.339 align:start position:0%
the end of the sentence shall not apply
 
00:56:17.870 --> 00:56:17.880 align:start position:0%
so from 9 22 to line 25.
 
00:56:19.849 --> 00:56:19.859 align:start position:0%
okay so the whole sentence right right
 
00:56:19.859 --> 00:56:21.710 align:start position:0%
okay so the whole sentence right right
okay

00:56:21.710 --> 00:56:21.720 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:56:24.049 --> 00:56:24.059 align:start position:0%
that will still allowed the private
 
00:56:24.059 --> 00:56:28.250 align:start position:0%
that will still allowed the private
Investments

00:56:28.250 --> 00:56:28.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:32.030 --> 00:56:32.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:33.710 --> 00:56:33.720 align:start position:0%
well then I'll be happy to answer right
 
00:56:35.690 --> 00:56:35.700 align:start position:0%
so at this moment I'm going to start I'm
 
00:56:37.370 --> 00:56:37.380 align:start position:0%
gonna remain do you want the whole
 
00:56:39.049 --> 00:56:39.059 align:start position:0%
sentence the cost of personnel assist in
 
00:56:40.670 --> 00:56:40.680 align:start position:0%
the operation the pool shall be
 
00:56:42.410 --> 00:56:42.420 align:start position:0%
determined in accordance with per diem
 
00:56:44.569 --> 00:56:44.579 align:start position:0%
examination you want that delete also
 
00:56:46.309 --> 00:56:46.319 align:start position:0%
you want the whole sentence deleted or
 
00:56:47.870 --> 00:56:47.880 align:start position:0%
you want to leave just that per diem
 
00:56:50.569 --> 00:56:50.579 align:start position:0%
that will work uh Miss chairman just
 
00:56:52.910 --> 00:56:52.920 align:start position:0%
because we do not have that specific
 
00:56:52.920 --> 00:56:55.130 align:start position:0%
because we do not have that specific
methodology

00:56:55.130 --> 00:56:55.140 align:start position:0%
methodology
 
00:56:56.990 --> 00:56:57.000 align:start position:0%
um again we will have to figure it out
 
00:56:59.089 --> 00:56:59.099 align:start position:0%
really a methodology for us but we will
 
00:57:00.710 --> 00:57:00.720 align:start position:0%
probably start tracking our time so
 
00:57:02.150 --> 00:57:02.160 align:start position:0%
we're going to do a subcommittee so it'd
 
00:57:03.710 --> 00:57:03.720 align:start position:0%
be great if you guys spend a little time
 
00:57:06.470 --> 00:57:06.480 align:start position:0%
and if you want to create something for
 
00:57:08.030 --> 00:57:08.040 align:start position:0%
us that would be helpful absolutely
 
00:57:11.710 --> 00:57:11.720 align:start position:0%
happy to do that great thank you
 
00:57:17.170 --> 00:57:17.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:20.690 --> 00:57:20.700 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I forgot your name but but
 
00:57:24.410 --> 00:57:24.420 align:start position:0%
you're you're all set okay all right so
 
00:57:26.150 --> 00:57:26.160 align:start position:0%
I have no other cards
 
00:57:28.130 --> 00:57:28.140 align:start position:0%
and no one wants to speak we will close
 
00:57:32.270 --> 00:57:32.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:34.069 --> 00:57:34.079 align:start position:0%
let's see
 
00:57:37.430 --> 00:57:37.440 align:start position:0%
to Marvel how I do that huh
 
00:57:37.440 --> 01:00:22.789 align:start position:0%
to Marvel how I do that huh
okay

01:00:22.789 --> 01:00:22.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:25.069 --> 01:00:25.079 align:start position:0%
all right we'll open up the public
 
01:00:28.010 --> 01:00:28.020 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill 648 and hear from
 
01:00:31.370 --> 01:00:31.380 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor representative Gerhart
 
01:00:33.770 --> 01:00:33.780 align:start position:0%
you did fill out a pink card right I see
 
01:00:36.289 --> 01:00:36.299 align:start position:0%
you have a pink card in your hand
 
01:00:38.089 --> 01:00:38.099 align:start position:0%
okay you'll get it to me afterwards
 
01:00:48.670 --> 01:00:48.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:51.349 --> 01:00:51.359 align:start position:0%
good morning good morning thank you
 
01:00:55.069 --> 01:00:55.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:56.809 --> 01:00:56.819 align:start position:0%
Bill my name is Jason gerhardt I
 
01:01:01.910 --> 01:01:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:03.589 --> 01:01:03.599 align:start position:0%
Bill 648
 
01:01:06.530 --> 01:01:06.540 align:start position:0%
establishing a state-owned bank sounds
 
01:01:08.870 --> 01:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
very intensive but it's really not that
 
01:01:11.329 --> 01:01:11.339 align:start position:0%
complicated the state of North Dakota
 
01:01:14.690 --> 01:01:14.700 align:start position:0%
has had a state-owned bank since 1919.
 
01:01:17.089 --> 01:01:17.099 align:start position:0%
it was in regards to a essentially a
 
01:01:19.910 --> 01:01:19.920 align:start position:0%
farmer's revolt against the powers that
 
01:01:21.530 --> 01:01:21.540 align:start position:0%
ought not be back East that controlled
 
01:01:23.569 --> 01:01:23.579 align:start position:0%
the banking sector so they said hold on
 
01:01:25.370 --> 01:01:25.380 align:start position:0%
we can just do this ourselves
 
01:01:28.130 --> 01:01:28.140 align:start position:0%
they take all tax revenue by law put it
 
01:01:29.930 --> 01:01:29.940 align:start position:0%
into the state-owned bank
 
01:01:31.430 --> 01:01:31.440 align:start position:0%
and then they're able to leverage it
 
01:01:34.370 --> 01:01:34.380 align:start position:0%
which you only need 10 of you know Banks
 
01:01:34.380 --> 01:01:35.510 align:start position:0%
which you only need 10 of you know Banks
Reserves

01:01:35.510 --> 01:01:35.520 align:start position:0%
Reserves
 
01:01:37.910 --> 01:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
so they can loan out essentially nine
 
01:01:40.130 --> 01:01:40.140 align:start position:0%
times what they have in their vaults to
 
01:01:42.890 --> 01:01:42.900 align:start position:0%
the state for state infrastructure now
 
01:01:45.349 --> 01:01:45.359 align:start position:0%
North Dakota has extended their their
 
01:01:47.030 --> 01:01:47.040 align:start position:0%
Banks purview a little bit they've
 
01:01:48.829 --> 01:01:48.839 align:start position:0%
actually got into dealing with student
 
01:01:50.990 --> 01:01:51.000 align:start position:0%
loans and some other things that
 
01:01:52.430 --> 01:01:52.440 align:start position:0%
actually benefit the people of the state
 
01:01:54.710 --> 01:01:54.720 align:start position:0%
so it's one of those things where
 
01:01:56.450 --> 01:01:56.460 align:start position:0%
obviously it can be tailored to the
 
01:01:58.730 --> 01:01:58.740 align:start position:0%
desires of the state and the people's
 
01:02:01.250 --> 01:02:01.260 align:start position:0%
needs so it's not just you know
 
01:02:05.210 --> 01:02:05.220 align:start position:0%
this structure that can't be altered
 
01:02:07.250 --> 01:02:07.260 align:start position:0%
I have
 
01:02:10.730 --> 01:02:10.740 align:start position:0%
given you a packet of paper which the
 
01:02:13.010 --> 01:02:13.020 align:start position:0%
first two pages is what I want to
 
01:02:16.309 --> 01:02:16.319 align:start position:0%
discuss first in that this bill well the
 
01:02:18.650 --> 01:02:18.660 align:start position:0%
state-owned bank does not does not
 
01:02:21.589 --> 01:02:21.599 align:start position:0%
compete with local banks it is actually
 
01:02:24.250 --> 01:02:24.260 align:start position:0%
there to support them to provide
 
01:02:26.450 --> 01:02:26.460 align:start position:0%
liquidity to them for instance look at
 
01:02:28.490 --> 01:02:28.500 align:start position:0%
the chart on page two
 
01:02:30.410 --> 01:02:30.420 align:start position:0%
North Dakota
 
01:02:30.420 --> 01:02:31.849 align:start position:0%
North Dakota
has

01:02:31.849 --> 01:02:31.859 align:start position:0%
has
 
01:02:34.910 --> 01:02:34.920 align:start position:0%
like way more Banks per 100 000 people
 
01:02:37.549 --> 01:02:37.559 align:start position:0%
they have nearly 12 Banks where the U.S
 
01:02:39.589 --> 01:02:39.599 align:start position:0%
average is two
 
01:02:41.630 --> 01:02:41.640 align:start position:0%
so obviously you've been doing something
 
01:02:43.190 --> 01:02:43.200 align:start position:0%
writing on the first page the second
 
01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:44.390 align:start position:0%
writing on the first page the second
paragraph

01:02:44.390 --> 01:02:44.400 align:start position:0%
paragraph
 
01:02:46.130 --> 01:02:46.140 align:start position:0%
the small state of North Dakota has more
 
01:02:48.530 --> 01:02:48.540 align:start position:0%
Community Banks than Hawaii Maine and
 
01:02:50.150 --> 01:02:50.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire combined these states
 
01:02:51.589 --> 01:02:51.599 align:start position:0%
together have more than six times as
 
01:02:53.930 --> 01:02:53.940 align:start position:0%
many residents as North Dakota and this
 
01:02:55.490 --> 01:02:55.500 align:start position:0%
is from a
 
01:02:57.970 --> 01:02:57.980 align:start position:0%
I have it here it's a Northeast Midwest
 
01:03:00.710 --> 01:03:00.720 align:start position:0%
public policy Institute paper just
 
01:03:03.170 --> 01:03:03.180 align:start position:0%
detailing the the applicability of
 
01:03:04.910 --> 01:03:04.920 align:start position:0%
public Banks to that sector of the
 
01:03:04.920 --> 01:03:06.289 align:start position:0%
public Banks to that sector of the
country

01:03:06.289 --> 01:03:06.299 align:start position:0%
country
 
01:03:09.650 --> 01:03:09.660 align:start position:0%
now in the facts page this is from the
 
01:03:12.130 --> 01:03:12.140 align:start position:0%
public banking Institute which is
 
01:03:14.990 --> 01:03:15.000 align:start position:0%
uh run by a woman named Ellen Brown
 
01:03:16.370 --> 01:03:16.380 align:start position:0%
she's an attorney actually out in
 
01:03:18.170 --> 01:03:18.180 align:start position:0%
California but she's been pushing this
 
01:03:20.150 --> 01:03:20.160 align:start position:0%
public banking concept for a long time
 
01:03:22.069 --> 01:03:22.079 align:start position:0%
and the information they have on the
 
01:03:23.390 --> 01:03:23.400 align:start position:0%
website is amazing I was actually just
 
01:03:24.650 --> 01:03:24.660 align:start position:0%
in touch with them late into the hours
 
01:03:26.450 --> 01:03:26.460 align:start position:0%
last night getting everything squared
 
01:03:26.460 --> 01:03:27.589 align:start position:0%
last night getting everything squared
away

01:03:27.589 --> 01:03:27.599 align:start position:0%
away
 
01:03:30.530 --> 01:03:30.540 align:start position:0%
and she submitted to you guys a two-page
 
01:03:33.049 --> 01:03:33.059 align:start position:0%
written testimony that was emailed to
 
01:03:34.730 --> 01:03:34.740 align:start position:0%
so I'll just kind of talk a little bit
 
01:03:37.910 --> 01:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
about that but I won't detail it
 
01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:41.569 align:start position:0%
about that but I won't detail it
so

01:03:41.569 --> 01:03:41.579 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:45.230 --> 01:03:45.240 align:start position:0%
let's okay let me go this route
 
01:03:47.150 --> 01:03:47.160 align:start position:0%
does the Bank of North Dakota actually
 
01:03:49.490 --> 01:03:49.500 align:start position:0%
make any money for the state that's kind
 
01:03:50.750 --> 01:03:50.760 align:start position:0%
of critical to this whole thing it's not
 
01:03:53.809 --> 01:03:53.819 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:55.250 --> 01:03:55.260 align:start position:0%
according to the Wall Street Journal
 
01:03:57.650 --> 01:03:57.660 align:start position:0%
this is a 2014 article
 
01:03:58.910 --> 01:03:58.920 align:start position:0%
the Bank of North Dakota is more
 
01:04:00.770 --> 01:04:00.780 align:start position:0%
profitable even in Goldman Sachs and
 
01:04:02.930 --> 01:04:02.940 align:start position:0%
JPMorgan Chase perch's latest annual
 
01:04:05.150 --> 01:04:05.160 align:start position:0%
report in 2021
 
01:04:07.130 --> 01:04:07.140 align:start position:0%
the Bank of North Dakota had a return of
 
01:04:09.829 --> 01:04:09.839 align:start position:0%
investment of 15 10 billion in assets
 
01:04:12.109 --> 01:04:12.119 align:start position:0%
and an s p rating of a plus stable that
 
01:04:14.210 --> 01:04:14.220 align:start position:0%
same year JPMorgan Chase had an Roi of
 
01:04:16.010 --> 01:04:16.020 align:start position:0%
eight percent
 
01:04:17.270 --> 01:04:17.280 align:start position:0%
it's pretty impressive when you look at
 
01:04:18.950 --> 01:04:18.960 align:start position:0%
it and what I like the most about the
 
01:04:20.930 --> 01:04:20.940 align:start position:0%
concept is that it's completely publicly
 
01:04:22.789 --> 01:04:22.799 align:start position:0%
accessible we know where all the money
 
01:04:25.190 --> 01:04:25.200 align:start position:0%
is going and it stays within the state
 
01:04:27.170 --> 01:04:27.180 align:start position:0%
so we're not dealing with Bank of
 
01:04:28.849 --> 01:04:28.859 align:start position:0%
America whatever any of these major Mega
 
01:04:30.289 --> 01:04:30.299 align:start position:0%
Banks where they're taking the money and
 
01:04:31.730 --> 01:04:31.740 align:start position:0%
just shipping it out all the money is
 
01:04:34.250 --> 01:04:34.260 align:start position:0%
staying here four things we need
 
01:04:36.589 --> 01:04:36.599 align:start position:0%
so when you build a bridge or any kind
 
01:04:38.210 --> 01:04:38.220 align:start position:0%
of public infrastructure half the cost
 
01:04:39.470 --> 01:04:39.480 align:start position:0%
of that project goes to interest
 
01:04:41.569 --> 01:04:41.579 align:start position:0%
payments and especially now that if
 
01:04:43.730 --> 01:04:43.740 align:start position:0%
their interest rates are going up
 
01:04:45.950 --> 01:04:45.960 align:start position:0%
why would we spend double the amount of
 
01:04:47.569 --> 01:04:47.579 align:start position:0%
money we need to build a bridge when we
 
01:04:49.309 --> 01:04:49.319 align:start position:0%
can just do it ourselves with our own
 
01:04:49.319 --> 01:04:50.510 align:start position:0%
can just do it ourselves with our own
money

01:04:50.510 --> 01:04:50.520 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:04:53.089 --> 01:04:53.099 align:start position:0%
it just I don't see the rationale and
 
01:04:53.099 --> 01:04:54.349 align:start position:0%
it just I don't see the rationale and
especially

01:04:54.349 --> 01:04:54.359 align:start position:0%
especially
 
01:04:56.390 --> 01:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
if she addresses this in her
 
01:04:56.400 --> 01:04:59.210 align:start position:0%
if she addresses this in her
her

01:04:59.210 --> 01:04:59.220 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:59.220 --> 01:05:03.470 align:start position:0%
 
testimony

01:05:03.470 --> 01:05:03.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:05.690 --> 01:05:05.700 align:start position:0%
so what about risk-free rights the
 
01:05:06.829 --> 01:05:06.839 align:start position:0%
largest Wall Street Banks where most
 
01:05:08.510 --> 01:05:08.520 align:start position:0%
States currently Bank are facing massive
 
01:05:10.069 --> 01:05:10.079 align:start position:0%
hidden risks in the forms of trillions
 
01:05:12.109 --> 01:05:12.119 align:start position:0%
of dollars in derivative Holdings JP
 
01:05:14.150 --> 01:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
Morgan Chase alone has 55 trillion in
 
01:05:16.250 --> 01:05:16.260 align:start position:0%
derivatives some Financial commentators
 
01:05:17.510 --> 01:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
are pointing to these speculative bets
 
01:05:18.650 --> 01:05:18.660 align:start position:0%
is the Black Swan that could take down
 
01:05:21.770 --> 01:05:21.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:23.630 --> 01:05:23.640 align:start position:0%
she doesn't it's in here somewhere but I
 
01:05:24.410 --> 01:05:24.420 align:start position:0%
don't know where it is and I want to
 
01:05:26.210 --> 01:05:26.220 align:start position:0%
waste your time but also we have the
 
01:05:28.430 --> 01:05:28.440 align:start position:0%
issue of bail-ins so we're all familiar
 
01:05:29.870 --> 01:05:29.880 align:start position:0%
with bailouts and the government comes
 
01:05:31.430 --> 01:05:31.440 align:start position:0%
and gives Banks a bunch of money that
 
01:05:33.710 --> 01:05:33.720 align:start position:0%
just disappears but in Cyprus and
 
01:05:35.870 --> 01:05:35.880 align:start position:0%
elsewhere they actually took depositors
 
01:05:38.990 --> 01:05:39.000 align:start position:0%
money to cover their losses that's what
 
01:05:41.990 --> 01:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
they call a bail-in so I
 
01:05:43.609 --> 01:05:43.619 align:start position:0%
I see no reason why we should put the
 
01:05:45.230 --> 01:05:45.240 align:start position:0%
people of New Hampshire at risk for that
 
01:05:48.289 --> 01:05:48.299 align:start position:0%
if our state tax money is going to these
 
01:05:49.430 --> 01:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
Banks and all of a sudden they say hey
 
01:05:51.530 --> 01:05:51.540 align:start position:0%
guess what guys we're broke we are all
 
01:05:53.210 --> 01:05:53.220 align:start position:0%
in this together I don't want to be in
 
01:05:54.470 --> 01:05:54.480 align:start position:0%
it together with them
 
01:05:57.109 --> 01:05:57.119 align:start position:0%
I think we should just go our own way
 
01:05:59.690 --> 01:05:59.700 align:start position:0%
and I mean
 
01:06:03.170 --> 01:06:03.180 align:start position:0%
it's it's a it's an American
 
01:06:05.809 --> 01:06:05.819 align:start position:0%
tradition I mean the bankers I mean the
 
01:06:07.970 --> 01:06:07.980 align:start position:0%
farmers out in North Dakota said we're
 
01:06:09.470 --> 01:06:09.480 align:start position:0%
done and I just I don't know I just find
 
01:06:12.530 --> 01:06:12.540 align:start position:0%
that so amazing so
 
01:06:17.150 --> 01:06:17.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:19.130 --> 01:06:19.140 align:start position:0%
the transparency is obvious so
 
01:06:21.589 --> 01:06:21.599 align:start position:0%
politicians can't take this over
 
01:06:23.270 --> 01:06:23.280 align:start position:0%
I would really like to answer some of
 
01:06:24.650 --> 01:06:24.660 align:start position:0%
your questions instead of just going on
 
01:06:32.710 --> 01:06:32.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:34.910 --> 01:06:34.920 align:start position:0%
your first
 
01:06:36.529 --> 01:06:36.539 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
01:06:39.289 --> 01:06:39.299 align:start position:0%
question over here okay
 
01:06:41.690 --> 01:06:41.700 align:start position:0%
um my question is my understanding is
 
01:06:45.170 --> 01:06:45.180 align:start position:0%
North Dakota is the only state bank in
 
01:06:46.430 --> 01:06:46.440 align:start position:0%
the country
 
01:06:48.890 --> 01:06:48.900 align:start position:0%
so this thing has been so wildly
 
01:06:51.589 --> 01:06:51.599 align:start position:0%
successful why is why are they the only
 
01:06:52.970 --> 01:06:52.980 align:start position:0%
one doing this
 
01:06:55.849 --> 01:06:55.859 align:start position:0%
one answer one one word answer lobbyists
 
01:06:57.950 --> 01:06:57.960 align:start position:0%
so there was actually a white paper put
 
01:06:59.270 --> 01:06:59.280 align:start position:0%
out I believe it was I was trying to
 
01:07:00.890 --> 01:07:00.900 align:start position:0%
look for it last night but I couldn't
 
01:07:04.130 --> 01:07:04.140 align:start position:0%
it's out there somewhere but
 
01:07:06.230 --> 01:07:06.240 align:start position:0%
I forget what it is the Rockefeller
 
01:07:07.609 --> 01:07:07.619 align:start position:0%
funded something this actually has
 
01:07:09.770 --> 01:07:09.780 align:start position:0%
Rockefeller right in it but they put out
 
01:07:12.109 --> 01:07:12.119 align:start position:0%
a white paper in 2017 or so saying that
 
01:07:13.849 --> 01:07:13.859 align:start position:0%
you know New Hampshire doesn't need this
 
01:07:16.190 --> 01:07:16.200 align:start position:0%
bank and blah blah blah the established
 
01:07:16.200 --> 01:07:18.049 align:start position:0%
bank and blah blah blah the established
Banks

01:07:18.049 --> 01:07:18.059 align:start position:0%
Banks
 
01:07:20.329 --> 01:07:20.339 align:start position:0%
they would stand to lose a lot
 
01:07:22.490 --> 01:07:22.500 align:start position:0%
in the way of fees so another thing
 
01:07:23.750 --> 01:07:23.760 align:start position:0%
that's interesting and they got caught
 
01:07:26.270 --> 01:07:26.280 align:start position:0%
red-handed I mean the mega banks are
 
01:07:28.910 --> 01:07:28.920 align:start position:0%
pretty they're felons on a whole nother
 
01:07:30.289 --> 01:07:30.299 align:start position:0%
level but
 
01:07:32.390 --> 01:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
literally they've they just paid the
 
01:07:33.710 --> 01:07:33.720 align:start position:0%
fines and write them off on their taxes
 
01:07:35.029 --> 01:07:35.039 align:start position:0%
and keep it moving
 
01:07:37.490 --> 01:07:37.500 align:start position:0%
but there was a scandal where they were
 
01:07:40.130 --> 01:07:40.140 align:start position:0%
manipulating the the interest rates paid
 
01:07:41.690 --> 01:07:41.700 align:start position:0%
to town so if I want to build a bridge I
 
01:07:43.549 --> 01:07:43.559 align:start position:0%
get a 50 million loan to build it or
 
01:07:44.750 --> 01:07:44.760 align:start position:0%
School let's say
 
01:07:46.670 --> 01:07:46.680 align:start position:0%
you don't spend all that money at once
 
01:07:49.430 --> 01:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
so you slowly take out of that and the
 
01:07:50.630 --> 01:07:50.640 align:start position:0%
money that's remaining in that account
 
01:07:51.950 --> 01:07:51.960 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to pay you interest on
 
01:07:54.049 --> 01:07:54.059 align:start position:0%
which is competitive market rate well
 
01:07:55.370 --> 01:07:55.380 align:start position:0%
they were playing games with their other
 
01:07:56.569 --> 01:07:56.579 align:start position:0%
friends and keeping the rate
 
01:07:58.849 --> 01:07:58.859 align:start position:0%
artificially low that was a big Scandal
 
01:08:02.329 --> 01:08:02.339 align:start position:0%
I want us don't quote me on the exact
 
01:08:03.710 --> 01:08:03.720 align:start position:0%
name of it but if you want I will submit
 
01:08:05.450 --> 01:08:05.460 align:start position:0%
testimony as regards to that Rolling
 
01:08:07.190 --> 01:08:07.200 align:start position:0%
Stone Matt taby actually did an article
 
01:08:08.990 --> 01:08:09.000 align:start position:0%
on it it was he's a really good writer
 
01:08:11.390 --> 01:08:11.400 align:start position:0%
and that was very well done but
 
01:08:14.750 --> 01:08:14.760 align:start position:0%
follow-up for the question may inquire
 
01:08:17.150 --> 01:08:17.160 align:start position:0%
other organizations
 
01:08:17.160 --> 01:08:17.829 align:start position:0%
other organizations
um

01:08:17.829 --> 01:08:17.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:21.289 --> 01:08:21.299 align:start position:0%
banking every the banking Department who
 
01:08:22.849 --> 01:08:22.859 align:start position:0%
else has been involved in putting this
 
01:08:25.430 --> 01:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
bill together and who have you consulted
 
01:08:28.309 --> 01:08:28.319 align:start position:0%
who would be impacted
 
01:08:30.769 --> 01:08:30.779 align:start position:0%
not many so getting elected I didn't
 
01:08:32.390 --> 01:08:32.400 align:start position:0%
realize the timeline was so tight in
 
01:08:34.669 --> 01:08:34.679 align:start position:0%
submitting bills so I'm not gonna lie I
 
01:08:37.010 --> 01:08:37.020 align:start position:0%
kind of was but I wanted to get this in
 
01:08:38.749 --> 01:08:38.759 align:start position:0%
because I campaigned on this I literally
 
01:08:40.130 --> 01:08:40.140 align:start position:0%
went door to door in Franklin or
 
01:08:42.470 --> 01:08:42.480 align:start position:0%
Northfield and people are excited about
 
01:08:44.450 --> 01:08:44.460 align:start position:0%
this I mean why would you want to spend
 
01:08:46.070 --> 01:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
double on a public infrastructure
 
01:08:48.370 --> 01:08:48.380 align:start position:0%
project it doesn't make any sense
 
01:08:50.749 --> 01:08:50.759 align:start position:0%
there's no justification for it we're
 
01:08:51.829 --> 01:08:51.839 align:start position:0%
going to go through an institution that
 
01:08:53.870 --> 01:08:53.880 align:start position:0%
has less transparency could eventually
 
01:08:55.970 --> 01:08:55.980 align:start position:0%
steal your money and besides that I mean
 
01:08:56.990 --> 01:08:57.000 align:start position:0%
they're engaged in a whole bunch of
 
01:08:58.729 --> 01:08:58.739 align:start position:0%
shady stuff anyway at least we'll know
 
01:09:00.289 --> 01:09:00.299 align:start position:0%
now that money is somewhere safe and
 
01:09:01.729 --> 01:09:01.739 align:start position:0%
stays in New Hampshire that's the
 
01:09:03.050 --> 01:09:03.060 align:start position:0%
critical thing to this as far as I'm
 
01:09:04.610 --> 01:09:04.620 align:start position:0%
concerned keeping the money here it's
 
01:09:06.050 --> 01:09:06.060 align:start position:0%
our money
 
01:09:08.990 --> 01:09:09.000 align:start position:0%
representative Spears next
 
01:09:11.269 --> 01:09:11.279 align:start position:0%
I glanced through the papers that you
 
01:09:12.530 --> 01:09:12.540 align:start position:0%
gave and I found most of those online
 
01:09:16.130 --> 01:09:16.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:18.530 --> 01:09:18.540 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire collects its taxes and its

New Hampshire collects its taxes and its
fees

01:09:19.910 --> 01:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
fees
 
01:09:19.920 --> 01:09:21.110 align:start position:0%

keeps

01:09:21.110 --> 01:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
keeps
 
01:09:22.910 --> 01:09:22.920 align:start position:0%
the generate what it does with that
 
01:09:26.090 --> 01:09:26.100 align:start position:0%
money is controlled oftentimes very
 
01:09:28.490 --> 01:09:28.500 align:start position:0%
locally at municipalities like property
 
01:09:28.500 --> 01:09:29.570 align:start position:0%
locally at municipalities like property
taxes

01:09:29.570 --> 01:09:29.580 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
01:09:32.450 --> 01:09:32.460 align:start position:0%
state taxes are used for things within
 
01:09:34.010 --> 01:09:34.020 align:start position:0%

no one consults anybody outside of the

no one consults anybody outside of the

state
 
01:09:41.450 --> 01:09:41.460 align:start position:0%
we don't give our money to people to
 
01:09:43.610 --> 01:09:43.620 align:start position:0%
control it as they did when new when
 
01:09:46.249 --> 01:09:46.259 align:start position:0%
North Dakota started their problem
 
01:09:48.709 --> 01:09:48.719 align:start position:0%
we don't do that here it's not like we
 
01:09:50.809 --> 01:09:50.819 align:start position:0%
go and ask a bank in New York are we
 
01:09:52.490 --> 01:09:52.500 align:start position:0%
allowed to build a bridge we don't
 
01:09:56.930 --> 01:09:56.940 align:start position:0%
everything is done locally here
 
01:09:59.030 --> 01:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
in order to do this we would have to
 
01:10:01.010 --> 01:10:01.020 align:start position:0%
take our money from the taxes and
 
01:10:02.689 --> 01:10:02.699 align:start position:0%
instead of the state treasurer and
 
01:10:04.930 --> 01:10:04.940 align:start position:0%
everybody else who we have
 
01:10:07.310 --> 01:10:07.320 align:start position:0%
constituted to take care of that money
 
01:10:09.890 --> 01:10:09.900 align:start position:0%
for us with a triple threat a triple A
 
01:10:09.900 --> 01:10:11.330 align:start position:0%
for us with a triple threat a triple A
rating

01:10:11.330 --> 01:10:11.340 align:start position:0%
rating
 
01:10:13.790 --> 01:10:13.800 align:start position:0%
we're going to ask a new bank to take
 
01:10:16.010 --> 01:10:16.020 align:start position:0%
that money instead is that what we're
 
01:10:17.630 --> 01:10:17.640 align:start position:0%
asking them to do
 
01:10:20.750 --> 01:10:20.760 align:start position:0%
start up just a whole nother new bank
 
01:10:23.270 --> 01:10:23.280 align:start position:0%
to make up for all the laws and all the
 
01:10:25.669 --> 01:10:25.679 align:start position:0%
control we have on what happens to our
 
01:10:27.229 --> 01:10:27.239 align:start position:0%
money now
 
01:10:29.689 --> 01:10:29.699 align:start position:0%
is that what you're asking for
 
01:10:32.570 --> 01:10:32.580 align:start position:0%
no I would say that the treasurer is
 
01:10:34.430 --> 01:10:34.440 align:start position:0%
intimately involved with the the
 
01:10:36.169 --> 01:10:36.179 align:start position:0%
Runnings of this bank this is not some
 
01:10:37.250 --> 01:10:37.260 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
01:10:40.250 --> 01:10:40.260 align:start position:0%
shade ball operation Opera it's so Bank
 
01:10:42.350 --> 01:10:42.360 align:start position:0%
of North Dakota has one
 
01:10:44.149 --> 01:10:44.159 align:start position:0%
building that's it there's no branches
 
01:10:46.370 --> 01:10:46.380 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't compete this I know that
 
01:10:48.050 --> 01:10:48.060 align:start position:0%
wasn't your question but
 
01:10:50.689 --> 01:10:50.699 align:start position:0%
It's contained within that one aspect
 
01:10:52.790 --> 01:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
and what I would say is when we're
 
01:10:54.350 --> 01:10:54.360 align:start position:0%
taking our taxes and we're putting it
 
01:10:56.270 --> 01:10:56.280 align:start position:0%
into any account any municipality
 
01:10:58.850 --> 01:10:58.860 align:start position:0%
whatever it may be that let's say it's a
 
01:11:00.110 --> 01:11:00.120 align:start position:0%
million dollars that million dollars
 
01:11:01.850 --> 01:11:01.860 align:start position:0%
just sits there now yes we're getting
 
01:11:05.090 --> 01:11:05.100 align:start position:0%
interest whatever one percent but with
 
01:11:07.310 --> 01:11:07.320 align:start position:0%
the magic of fractional instead of
 
01:11:10.689 --> 01:11:10.699 align:start position:0%
banking you can multiply that in loans
 
01:11:13.490 --> 01:11:13.500 align:start position:0%
essentially 10 times so if I have a
 
01:11:15.530 --> 01:11:15.540 align:start position:0%
Million Dollars in My Vault I can loan
 
01:11:17.330 --> 01:11:17.340 align:start position:0%
up to nine times I only need ten percent
 
01:11:19.370 --> 01:11:19.380 align:start position:0%
of that sitting in the vault if this
 
01:11:20.630 --> 01:11:20.640 align:start position:0%
makes any sense I know it doesn't really
 
01:11:22.310 --> 01:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
make sense and it really shouldn't be
 
01:11:23.870 --> 01:11:23.880 align:start position:0%
this way but this is the magic of
 
01:11:25.550 --> 01:11:25.560 align:start position:0%
fractional Reserve Banking and hence our
 
01:11:27.950 --> 01:11:27.960 align:start position:0%
problems since the Federal Reserve but
 
01:11:30.110 --> 01:11:30.120 align:start position:0%
so you're actually able to multiply that
 
01:11:32.090 --> 01:11:32.100 align:start position:0%
money and then use it for loans and
 
01:11:33.770 --> 01:11:33.780 align:start position:0%
you're loaning it to to entities that
 
01:11:35.689 --> 01:11:35.699 align:start position:0%
aren't going to go out of business if we
 
01:11:37.070 --> 01:11:37.080 align:start position:0%
build a bridge in Concord is Concord
 
01:11:38.270 --> 01:11:38.280 align:start position:0%
going to disappear tomorrow are they
 
01:11:39.290 --> 01:11:39.300 align:start position:0%
going to run off with the money and go
 
01:11:41.090 --> 01:11:41.100 align:start position:0%
to the Bahamas it's one of those kind of
 
01:11:42.410 --> 01:11:42.420 align:start position:0%
things where these are these are
 
01:11:44.030 --> 01:11:44.040 align:start position:0%
investments that are extremely stable
 
01:11:45.890 --> 01:11:45.900 align:start position:0%
and I just want to add unrelated but
 
01:11:45.900 --> 01:11:46.970 align:start position:0%
and I just want to add unrelated but
related

01:11:46.970 --> 01:11:46.980 align:start position:0%
related
 
01:11:49.610 --> 01:11:49.620 align:start position:0%
that I'm on e-dna and we've been dealing
 
01:11:51.770 --> 01:11:51.780 align:start position:0%
with a lot of pension issues and there's
 
01:11:53.030 --> 01:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
actually people throughout the country
 
01:11:55.729 --> 01:11:55.739 align:start position:0%
that are looking into taking
 
01:11:57.470 --> 01:11:57.480 align:start position:0%
the the pension money that's just
 
01:11:58.669 --> 01:11:58.679 align:start position:0%
sitting there I mean you know it's
 
01:12:00.410 --> 01:12:00.420 align:start position:0%
making six and a half percent or
 
01:12:01.850 --> 01:12:01.860 align:start position:0%
whatever their their figures are their
 
01:12:04.010 --> 01:12:04.020 align:start position:0%
targets but if we could take that money
 
01:12:05.870 --> 01:12:05.880 align:start position:0%
and then multiply it
 
01:12:09.110 --> 01:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
nine times you're there's no loss if
 
01:12:10.310 --> 01:12:10.320 align:start position:0%
they're all secure loans and you don't
 
01:12:11.330 --> 01:12:11.340 align:start position:0%
have to mult you don't have to leverage
 
01:12:13.070 --> 01:12:13.080 align:start position:0%
it to the max I'm just saying that's one
 
01:12:15.110 --> 01:12:15.120 align:start position:0%
idea one Theory and this there's other
 
01:12:16.990 --> 01:12:17.000 align:start position:0%
bills inside the states
 
01:12:22.850 --> 01:12:22.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:26.530 --> 01:12:26.540 align:start position:0%
why would those loans be any more secure
 
01:12:29.930 --> 01:12:29.940 align:start position:0%
than whatever the banks are doing now
 
01:12:31.790 --> 01:12:31.800 align:start position:0%
people I
 
01:12:34.669 --> 01:12:34.679 align:start position:0%
I got you I got you so I mean um the
 
01:12:36.950 --> 01:12:36.960 align:start position:0%
issue is fees generally
 
01:12:41.209 --> 01:12:41.219 align:start position:0%
so she discusses it here here we go
 
01:12:43.610 --> 01:12:43.620 align:start position:0%
all right according to Moody's Municipal
 
01:12:46.689 --> 01:12:46.699 align:start position:0%
Bond default rate between 1970 2012 was
 
01:12:50.270 --> 01:12:50.280 align:start position:0%
0.012 virtually Zero versus 3.6 for
 
01:12:51.770 --> 01:12:51.780 align:start position:0%
corporate bonds okay so they're very
 
01:12:51.780 --> 01:12:52.490 align:start position:0%
corporate bonds okay so they're very
safe

01:12:52.490 --> 01:12:52.500 align:start position:0%
safe
 
01:12:55.010 --> 01:12:55.020 align:start position:0%
yet a costly and involved certification
 
01:12:57.590 --> 01:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
process is required to qualify municipal
 
01:13:00.590 --> 01:13:00.600 align:start position:0%
bonds and bond Underwriters get the fees
 
01:13:02.270 --> 01:13:02.280 align:start position:0%
these big out-of-state banks have caught
 
01:13:03.770 --> 01:13:03.780 align:start position:0%
have been caught in collusion which I
 
01:13:05.330 --> 01:13:05.340 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier bid rigging and bad
 
01:13:07.310 --> 01:13:07.320 align:start position:0%
swap advice paying over 2 billion in
 
01:13:10.130 --> 01:13:10.140 align:start position:0%
fines and fees since 2000.
 
01:13:11.510 --> 01:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
to avoid those fees some local
 
01:13:12.830 --> 01:13:12.840 align:start position:0%
governments have been borrowing directly
 
01:13:14.209 --> 01:13:14.219 align:start position:0%
from the banks according to Moody's
 
01:13:15.590 --> 01:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
twenty percent of new Municipal
 
01:13:17.510 --> 01:13:17.520 align:start position:0%
borrowings are direct bank loans
 
01:13:19.370 --> 01:13:19.380 align:start position:0%
advantages include lower rates fuel
 
01:13:21.470 --> 01:13:21.480 align:start position:0%
regulatory hurdles and lower transaction
 
01:13:23.450 --> 01:13:23.460 align:start position:0%
costs including avoiding fees for rating
 
01:13:25.790 --> 01:13:25.800 align:start position:0%
agents credit enhancements Bond trustees
 
01:13:27.290 --> 01:13:27.300 align:start position:0%
and their attorneys
 
01:13:29.510 --> 01:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
there's also no need for voter approval
 
01:13:31.189 --> 01:13:31.199 align:start position:0%
new money is created as credit for the
 
01:13:33.050 --> 01:13:33.060 align:start position:0%
local economy and rather than paying
 
01:13:35.270 --> 01:13:35.280 align:start position:0%
interest for 30 years on a jumbo Bond
 
01:13:37.310 --> 01:13:37.320 align:start position:0%
municipality can just draw on its credit
 
01:13:40.010 --> 01:13:40.020 align:start position:0%
line with the bank as needed does that
 
01:13:42.709 --> 01:13:42.719 align:start position:0%
kind of make sense
 
01:13:44.689 --> 01:13:44.699 align:start position:0%
look I'm not gonna lie I'm a car no I'm
 
01:13:46.550 --> 01:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
not gonna lie I'm a carpenter so this
 
01:13:47.689 --> 01:13:47.699 align:start position:0%
banking stuff's a little bit new but
 
01:13:49.610 --> 01:13:49.620 align:start position:0%
just to me it's very basic and I I just
 
01:13:50.750 --> 01:13:50.760 align:start position:0%
love the fact that a bunch of farmers
 
01:13:52.310 --> 01:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
said hold on we're done and I'm not
 
01:13:53.689 --> 01:13:53.699 align:start position:0%
saying that this bill that I submitted
 
01:13:55.790 --> 01:13:55.800 align:start position:0%
is perfect it most likely can use some
 
01:13:56.810 --> 01:13:56.820 align:start position:0%
work and there's actually some
 
01:13:58.430 --> 01:13:58.440 align:start position:0%
suggestions that we were discussing
 
01:13:59.750 --> 01:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
about it
 
01:14:02.090 --> 01:14:02.100 align:start position:0%
but I think the basic concept is solid
 
01:14:02.100 --> 01:14:03.290 align:start position:0%
but I think the basic concept is solid
so

01:14:03.290 --> 01:14:03.300 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:14:05.510 --> 01:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
okay we have a lot of questions next up
 
01:14:08.209 --> 01:14:08.219 align:start position:0%
is representative Gibbs
 
01:14:10.669 --> 01:14:10.679 align:start position:0%
and thank you sir thank you
 
01:14:14.149 --> 01:14:14.159 align:start position:0%
you've given us Pages 21 and 22 of a
 
01:14:16.729 --> 01:14:16.739 align:start position:0%
document can you tell us what that yes
 
01:14:19.490 --> 01:14:19.500 align:start position:0%
what that document is and where we can
 
01:14:20.810 --> 01:14:20.820 align:start position:0%
find the rest of it I will submit it to
 
01:14:22.010 --> 01:14:22.020 align:start position:0%
you I was worried about setting you
 
01:14:23.570 --> 01:14:23.580 align:start position:0%
three million Pages before the hearing
 
01:14:25.729 --> 01:14:25.739 align:start position:0%
go oh and everybody just taken call in
 
01:14:27.890 --> 01:14:27.900 align:start position:0%
sick today it's the Northeast Midwest
 
01:14:29.930 --> 01:14:29.940 align:start position:0%
Institute white people white paper
 
01:14:31.550 --> 01:14:31.560 align:start position:0%
public banking in the Northeast and
 
01:14:34.250 --> 01:14:34.260 align:start position:0%
midwest states September of 2019. I will
 
01:14:36.709 --> 01:14:36.719 align:start position:0%
submit it to the now if you just submit
 
01:14:38.689 --> 01:14:38.699 align:start position:0%
the link send the whole thing you know
 
01:14:40.550 --> 01:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
email let me just want the whole report
 
01:14:44.390 --> 01:14:44.400 align:start position:0%
yeah as PDF yeah done yeah it doesn't no
 
01:14:46.189 --> 01:14:46.199 align:start position:0%
printing paper unless they print it on
 
01:14:47.570 --> 01:14:47.580 align:start position:0%
their own well no it's 90 pages I was
 
01:14:48.530 --> 01:14:48.540 align:start position:0%
gonna print it I was going to send you
 
01:14:49.970 --> 01:14:49.980 align:start position:0%
the link but I'll send a PDF if you want
 
01:14:54.050 --> 01:14:54.060 align:start position:0%
no problem we've seen big big stuff okay
 
01:14:57.530 --> 01:14:57.540 align:start position:0%
uh representative thank you um obviously
 
01:14:59.990 --> 01:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
this is going to take some Capital
 
01:15:02.330 --> 01:15:02.340 align:start position:0%
um and that's my question how much
 
01:15:04.669 --> 01:15:04.679 align:start position:0%
Capital do you think it's going to be
 
01:15:07.010 --> 01:15:07.020 align:start position:0%
required to get it started and what
 
01:15:09.770 --> 01:15:09.780 align:start position:0%
sources out of in New Hampshire or do
 
01:15:11.890 --> 01:15:11.900 align:start position:0%
you think it'll come from
 
01:15:14.030 --> 01:15:14.040 align:start position:0%
there's a paragraph that addresses that
 
01:15:16.669 --> 01:15:16.679 align:start position:0%
exact issue so but so what about Capital
 
01:15:18.229 --> 01:15:18.239 align:start position:0%
the amount required and where to get it
 
01:15:19.729 --> 01:15:19.739 align:start position:0%
depend on state regulations and what you
 
01:15:21.290 --> 01:15:21.300 align:start position:0%
want the bank to do that's the critical
 
01:15:22.729 --> 01:15:22.739 align:start position:0%
thing we have to figure out what we want
 
01:15:25.130 --> 01:15:25.140 align:start position:0%
this bank to do it's scope but we've
 
01:15:26.630 --> 01:15:26.640 align:start position:0%
seen figures ranging from 10 million to
 
01:15:27.950 --> 01:15:27.960 align:start position:0%
35 million depending on the state
 
01:15:29.510 --> 01:15:29.520 align:start position:0%
sources could include a budget
 
01:15:31.669 --> 01:15:31.679 align:start position:0%
appropriation bond issue or debt for
 
01:15:33.410 --> 01:15:33.420 align:start position:0%
Equity swaps trading Securities for
 
01:15:37.790 --> 01:15:37.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:40.430 --> 01:15:40.440 align:start position:0%
you do realize a bond issue is illegal
 
01:15:42.370 --> 01:15:42.380 align:start position:0%
under the banking Department's
 
01:15:45.350 --> 01:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
collateral requirement I mean a cash
 
01:15:48.290 --> 01:15:48.300 align:start position:0%
value in other words it has to be real
 
01:15:50.450 --> 01:15:50.460 align:start position:0%
money to be invested in a bank in New
 
01:15:50.460 --> 01:15:51.110 align:start position:0%
money to be invested in a bank in New
Hampshire

01:15:51.110 --> 01:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:15:52.550 --> 01:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
you would be violating New Hampshire
 
01:15:54.470 --> 01:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
State Bank regulation okay I'll have to
 
01:15:56.209 --> 01:15:56.219 align:start position:0%
work on that then okay that could be a
 
01:15:56.219 --> 01:15:57.709 align:start position:0%
work on that then okay that could be a
problem

01:15:57.709 --> 01:15:57.719 align:start position:0%
problem
 
01:16:00.169 --> 01:16:00.179 align:start position:0%
representative Terry thank you
 
01:16:04.010 --> 01:16:04.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:06.590 --> 01:16:06.600 align:start position:0%
uh you've given us a lot yes and a lot
 
01:16:09.890 --> 01:16:09.900 align:start position:0%
to think about uh I find this to be a
 
01:16:09.900 --> 01:16:11.810 align:start position:0%
to think about uh I find this to be a
fascinating

01:16:11.810 --> 01:16:11.820 align:start position:0%
fascinating
 
01:16:11.820 --> 01:16:14.750 align:start position:0%
fascinating
proposal

01:16:14.750 --> 01:16:14.760 align:start position:0%
proposal
 
01:16:18.830 --> 01:16:18.840 align:start position:0%
the states are are Laboratories for
 
01:16:21.470 --> 01:16:21.480 align:start position:0%
Innovation that's one of the beauties of
 
01:16:22.910 --> 01:16:22.920 align:start position:0%
our federal system
 
01:16:22.920 --> 01:16:24.370 align:start position:0%
our federal system
I'm

01:16:24.370 --> 01:16:24.380 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
01:16:28.970 --> 01:16:28.980 align:start position:0%
you're new you've just presented this uh
 
01:16:31.370 --> 01:16:31.380 align:start position:0%
for the first time I'm wondering if you
 
01:16:35.030 --> 01:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
would be at all amenable to uh a
 
01:16:36.950 --> 01:16:36.960 align:start position:0%
suggestion of a study committee or a
 
01:16:41.709 --> 01:16:41.719 align:start position:0%
study commission so that uh more
 
01:16:44.830 --> 01:16:44.840 align:start position:0%
broadly representative
 
01:16:48.050 --> 01:16:48.060 align:start position:0%
input could be provided to this
 
01:16:48.060 --> 01:16:50.090 align:start position:0%
input could be provided to this
committee

01:16:50.090 --> 01:16:50.100 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:16:53.090 --> 01:16:53.100 align:start position:0%
definitely I yes I think the more people
 
01:16:54.530 --> 01:16:54.540 align:start position:0%
we can get involved especially the state
 
01:16:56.570 --> 01:16:56.580 align:start position:0%
agencies and try to figure out what we
 
01:16:57.950 --> 01:16:57.960 align:start position:0%
want this bank to do what it's you know
 
01:17:00.890 --> 01:17:00.900 align:start position:0%
indeed thank you thank you okay
 
01:17:03.110 --> 01:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
representative Burroughs thank you I
 
01:17:05.990 --> 01:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
just needed a clarification because
 
01:17:07.310 --> 01:17:07.320 align:start position:0%
um it's you know in the beginning of the
 
01:17:09.470 --> 01:17:09.480 align:start position:0%
bill it said that this is
 
01:17:09.480 --> 01:17:11.390 align:start position:0%
bill it said that this is
um

01:17:11.390 --> 01:17:11.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:14.270 --> 01:17:14.280 align:start position:0%
narrowly focus on public funds but yeah
 
01:17:16.310 --> 01:17:16.320 align:start position:0%
and on page two it said that the board
 
01:17:18.590 --> 01:17:18.600 align:start position:0%
advisory committee is going to actively
 
01:17:20.270 --> 01:17:20.280 align:start position:0%
enlist the help of private interest
 
01:17:22.729 --> 01:17:22.739 align:start position:0%
price and encourage the use of the bang
 
01:17:25.070 --> 01:17:25.080 align:start position:0%
so could you explain that well I would
 
01:17:27.649 --> 01:17:27.659 align:start position:0%
say that ref that's more related to the
 
01:17:29.510 --> 01:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
first page when we're talking about how
 
01:17:31.189 --> 01:17:31.199 align:start position:0%
North Dakota has the most banks per
 
01:17:33.709 --> 01:17:33.719 align:start position:0%
capita this bank is designed to support
 
01:17:35.870 --> 01:17:35.880 align:start position:0%
the smaller Banks who are really being
 
01:17:37.250 --> 01:17:37.260 align:start position:0%
squeezed out
 
01:17:39.229 --> 01:17:39.239 align:start position:0%
that's the main goal as far as I'm
 
01:17:41.270 --> 01:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
concerned because smaller banks are more
 
01:17:43.030 --> 01:17:43.040 align:start position:0%
intimately involved with their their
 
01:17:45.169 --> 01:17:45.179 align:start position:0%
corresponding neighborhoods and whatever
 
01:17:47.149 --> 01:17:47.159 align:start position:0%
you want to call it
 
01:17:47.159 --> 01:17:48.169 align:start position:0%
you want to call it
so

01:17:48.169 --> 01:17:48.179 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:17:51.770 --> 01:17:51.780 align:start position:0%
if we have many smaller Banks it
 
01:17:55.310 --> 01:17:55.320 align:start position:0%
provides more competition lower rates
 
01:17:57.530 --> 01:17:57.540 align:start position:0%
and better service for the individual
 
01:17:58.910 --> 01:17:58.920 align:start position:0%
communities involved instead of just
 
01:18:00.649 --> 01:18:00.659 align:start position:0%
having Mega bank that everybody's got to
 
01:18:02.689 --> 01:18:02.699 align:start position:0%
travel to it does that make any sense am
 
01:18:03.830 --> 01:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
I answering the question follow up yeah
 
01:18:06.709 --> 01:18:06.719 align:start position:0%
I'm still confused how are you
 
01:18:09.290 --> 01:18:09.300 align:start position:0%
separating public and private funds if
 
01:18:11.390 --> 01:18:11.400 align:start position:0%
you're getting you know how are the let
 
01:18:14.090 --> 01:18:14.100 align:start position:0%
me rephrase it how are these Community
 
01:18:17.630 --> 01:18:17.640 align:start position:0%
Banks involved if the if their State
 
01:18:20.870 --> 01:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
Bank is basically just overseeing public
 
01:18:20.880 --> 01:18:24.950 align:start position:0%
Bank is basically just overseeing public
funds

01:18:24.950 --> 01:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:27.709 --> 01:18:27.719 align:start position:0%
so instead of having to go to
 
01:18:30.169 --> 01:18:30.179 align:start position:0%
the Federal Reserve essentially for a
 
01:18:32.390 --> 01:18:32.400 align:start position:0%
line of credit they would go to the
 
01:18:34.250 --> 01:18:34.260 align:start position:0%
State Bank
 
01:18:36.229 --> 01:18:36.239 align:start position:0%
that's my point does that make any sense
 
01:18:38.570 --> 01:18:38.580 align:start position:0%
so they're not dealing with
 
01:18:40.610 --> 01:18:40.620 align:start position:0%
the major
 
01:18:42.770 --> 01:18:42.780 align:start position:0%
okay well I think we'll clarify that as
 
01:18:44.450 --> 01:18:44.460 align:start position:0%
well yes okay I'm probably answering it
 
01:18:45.950 --> 01:18:45.960 align:start position:0%
wrong so I'm not I apologize
 
01:18:50.330 --> 01:18:50.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:51.830 --> 01:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:18:54.890 --> 01:18:54.900 align:start position:0%
um some laptop is useful for doing the
 
01:18:58.250 --> 01:18:58.260 align:start position:0%
research would you believe this is the
 
01:19:00.169 --> 01:19:00.179 align:start position:0%
sixth time this bill has come before
 
01:19:03.229 --> 01:19:03.239 align:start position:0%
this committee it's a bipartisan issue
 
01:19:06.050 --> 01:19:06.060 align:start position:0%
the last time it was submitted in 2019
 
01:19:08.450 --> 01:19:08.460 align:start position:0%
it was sponsored by representative
 
01:19:08.460 --> 01:19:09.590 align:start position:0%
it was sponsored by representative
Marple

01:19:09.590 --> 01:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
Marple
 
01:19:12.410 --> 01:19:12.420 align:start position:0%
and representative Horrigan so that's a
 
01:19:14.510 --> 01:19:14.520 align:start position:0%
bipartisan bill
 
01:19:14.520 --> 01:19:15.110 align:start position:0%
bipartisan bill
um

01:19:15.110 --> 01:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:18.229 --> 01:19:18.239 align:start position:0%
so we have some history to go through uh
 
01:19:20.450 --> 01:19:20.460 align:start position:0%
would you believe to uh see why it
 
01:19:22.370 --> 01:19:22.380 align:start position:0%
didn't pass this committee uh five other
 
01:19:22.380 --> 01:19:24.530 align:start position:0%
didn't pass this committee uh five other
times

01:19:24.530 --> 01:19:24.540 align:start position:0%
times
 
01:19:27.649 --> 01:19:27.659 align:start position:0%
yes that would be more than welcome and
 
01:19:29.330 --> 01:19:29.340 align:start position:0%
I would just say it most likely has to
 
01:19:30.709 --> 01:19:30.719 align:start position:0%
do with the powers that ought not be
 
01:19:32.930 --> 01:19:32.940 align:start position:0%
trying to put the squash on it I think
 
01:19:35.390 --> 01:19:35.400 align:start position:0%
this is a this is a very
 
01:19:38.030 --> 01:19:38.040 align:start position:0%
very big deal
 
01:19:40.250 --> 01:19:40.260 align:start position:0%
not not me unless I but the bill the
 
01:19:41.570 --> 01:19:41.580 align:start position:0%
idea of just having a public bank for
 
01:19:43.430 --> 01:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
instance Tennessee right now there's a
 
01:19:45.110 --> 01:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
senator nicely that's pushing their bank
 
01:19:46.669 --> 01:19:46.679 align:start position:0%
but they're actually combining it with a
 
01:19:48.229 --> 01:19:48.239 align:start position:0%
gold depository
 
01:19:50.330 --> 01:19:50.340 align:start position:0%
and I think that's an interesting twist
 
01:19:52.430 --> 01:19:52.440 align:start position:0%
that might have some interest in the
 
01:19:54.169 --> 01:19:54.179 align:start position:0%
state but just the idea of it's all
 
01:19:56.149 --> 01:19:56.159 align:start position:0%
about keeping our wealth here
 
01:19:57.169 --> 01:19:57.179 align:start position:0%
I don't know if that I'm getting that
 
01:20:00.590 --> 01:20:00.600 align:start position:0%
message across but yes
 
01:20:00.600 --> 01:20:03.130 align:start position:0%
message across but yes
yeah

01:20:03.130 --> 01:20:03.140 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:20:05.630 --> 01:20:05.640 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs thank you Mr
 
01:20:05.640 --> 01:20:07.070 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs thank you Mr
chairman

01:20:07.070 --> 01:20:07.080 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:20:09.550 --> 01:20:09.560 align:start position:0%
um I need to request some clarification
 
01:20:12.890 --> 01:20:12.900 align:start position:0%
earlier it sounded as if
 
01:20:12.900 --> 01:20:14.090 align:start position:0%
earlier it sounded as if
um

01:20:14.090 --> 01:20:14.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:17.149 --> 01:20:17.159 align:start position:0%
the purpose of this bill and the purpose
 
01:20:20.410 --> 01:20:20.420 align:start position:0%
of establishing a state bank was to
 
01:20:23.510 --> 01:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
provide a better means of funding public
 
01:20:23.520 --> 01:20:25.669 align:start position:0%
provide a better means of funding public
projects

01:20:25.669 --> 01:20:25.679 align:start position:0%
projects
 
01:20:27.350 --> 01:20:27.360 align:start position:0%
um but
 
01:20:27.360 --> 01:20:28.390 align:start position:0%
um but
um

01:20:28.390 --> 01:20:28.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:32.689 --> 01:20:32.699 align:start position:0%
you also just said that the main goal
 
01:20:34.270 --> 01:20:34.280 align:start position:0%
was to
 
01:20:37.850 --> 01:20:37.860 align:start position:0%
support smaller Banks could you clarify
 
01:20:41.330 --> 01:20:41.340 align:start position:0%
a little bit about uh the goals of this
 
01:20:43.669 --> 01:20:43.679 align:start position:0%
proposal well the smaller Banks could
 
01:20:43.679 --> 01:20:45.050 align:start position:0%
proposal well the smaller Banks could
provide

01:20:45.050 --> 01:20:45.060 align:start position:0%
provide
 
01:20:47.689 --> 01:20:47.699 align:start position:0%
money for public infrastructure projects
 
01:20:49.970 --> 01:20:49.980 align:start position:0%
it's all really how we format the bank
 
01:20:53.149 --> 01:20:53.159 align:start position:0%
and what the authority like if if the
 
01:20:54.890 --> 01:20:54.900 align:start position:0%
smaller bank has the ability to provide
 
01:20:56.930 --> 01:20:56.940 align:start position:0%
the loan at a competitive rate
 
01:20:58.189 --> 01:20:58.199 align:start position:0%
then I think we should go that route
 
01:20:59.450 --> 01:20:59.460 align:start position:0%
instead of going directly to the
 
01:21:01.430 --> 01:21:01.440 align:start position:0%
state-owned bank it's just there this
 
01:21:03.350 --> 01:21:03.360 align:start position:0%
they're the Clearinghouse that's that's
 
01:21:07.070 --> 01:21:07.080 align:start position:0%
basically what I'm trying to get across
 
01:21:10.010 --> 01:21:10.020 align:start position:0%
great so uh Before I Let You Go
 
01:21:12.169 --> 01:21:12.179 align:start position:0%
um you you do know that like for student
 
01:21:14.689 --> 01:21:14.699 align:start position:0%
loans we have nifa we have that set up
 
01:21:17.390 --> 01:21:17.400 align:start position:0%
and we have the Bia for business loans
 
01:21:19.610 --> 01:21:19.620 align:start position:0%
so that that all those things that that
 
01:21:22.610 --> 01:21:22.620 align:start position:0%
bank does we actually have here in New
 
01:21:24.649 --> 01:21:24.659 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but we just have it structured
 
01:21:27.050 --> 01:21:27.060 align:start position:0%
differently than having it through their
 
01:21:28.610 --> 01:21:28.620 align:start position:0%
one statement you do know that right
 
01:21:30.590 --> 01:21:30.600 align:start position:0%
well I would say are they able to
 
01:21:31.970 --> 01:21:31.980 align:start position:0%
leverage it though
 
01:21:34.189 --> 01:21:34.199 align:start position:0%
potentially nine to one uh
 
01:21:36.050 --> 01:21:36.060 align:start position:0%
20 that they have
 
01:21:38.330 --> 01:21:38.340 align:start position:0%
okay so I'm not sure where you're going
 
01:21:39.770 --> 01:21:39.780 align:start position:0%
with that but let me ask you another
 
01:21:42.410 --> 01:21:42.420 align:start position:0%
question that is is uh you kept talking
 
01:21:44.270 --> 01:21:44.280 align:start position:0%
about Banks
 
01:21:46.310 --> 01:21:46.320 align:start position:0%
um so New Hampshire is very lucky to
 
01:21:49.910 --> 01:21:49.920 align:start position:0%
have the very first credit union which
 
01:21:51.649 --> 01:21:51.659 align:start position:0%
is a non-profit
 
01:21:55.130 --> 01:21:55.140 align:start position:0%
Community oriented yep
 
01:21:56.200 --> 01:21:56.210 align:start position:0%
you didn't mention
 
01:21:56.210 --> 01:21:57.350 align:start position:0%
you didn't mention
[Music]

01:21:57.350 --> 01:21:57.360 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:21:59.270 --> 01:21:59.280 align:start position:0%
them Credit Unions at all when you're
 
01:22:01.070 --> 01:22:01.080 align:start position:0%
talking about your comparison to other
 
01:22:02.990 --> 01:22:03.000 align:start position:0%
states with banks
 
01:22:05.570 --> 01:22:05.580 align:start position:0%
and I would say is that we have a very
 
01:22:09.530 --> 01:22:09.540 align:start position:0%
Lively Credit Union uh uh Association
 
01:22:13.010 --> 01:22:13.020 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire that uh would be
 
01:22:14.930 --> 01:22:14.940 align:start position:0%
doing those Community loans and be
 
01:22:16.490 --> 01:22:16.500 align:start position:0%
focused on the communities and taking
 
01:22:18.470 --> 01:22:18.480 align:start position:0%
care of the communities that much which
 
01:22:20.510 --> 01:22:20.520 align:start position:0%
you were hoping this tank State Bank
 
01:22:22.910 --> 01:22:22.920 align:start position:0%
would be and the last thing I'll leave
 
01:22:24.590 --> 01:22:24.600 align:start position:0%
you with because we have had this bill
 
01:22:28.189 --> 01:22:28.199 align:start position:0%
before and I have been around
 
01:22:31.310 --> 01:22:31.320 align:start position:0%
for a fair amount of time that the
 
01:22:33.110 --> 01:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
number one issue
 
01:22:36.350 --> 01:22:36.360 align:start position:0%
was that North Dakota was able to start
 
01:22:38.990 --> 01:22:39.000 align:start position:0%
their bank because at the time they had
 
01:22:43.669 --> 01:22:43.679 align:start position:0%
a huge windfall tax on resources that
 
01:22:46.790 --> 01:22:46.800 align:start position:0%
were being mined out of the state
 
01:22:49.490 --> 01:22:49.500 align:start position:0%
and the what they were trying to do is
 
01:22:52.189 --> 01:22:52.199 align:start position:0%
what should we do with this money
 
01:22:54.110 --> 01:22:54.120 align:start position:0%
well how about let's make sure the
 
01:22:56.810 --> 01:22:56.820 align:start position:0%
farmers can borrow it that's make sure
 
01:22:59.510 --> 01:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
the farmers can tap into it and that's
 
01:23:01.850 --> 01:23:01.860 align:start position:0%
why they created that State Bank because
 
01:23:05.209 --> 01:23:05.219 align:start position:0%
they had a windfall unless we can figure
 
01:23:07.189 --> 01:23:07.199 align:start position:0%
out how we can get more people to buy
 
01:23:07.199 --> 01:23:08.630 align:start position:0%
out how we can get more people to buy
granite

01:23:08.630 --> 01:23:08.640 align:start position:0%
granite
 
01:23:11.390 --> 01:23:11.400 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure we have any resource here
 
01:23:13.550 --> 01:23:13.560 align:start position:0%
that somebody wants to come and Quarry
 
01:23:17.030 --> 01:23:17.040 align:start position:0%
and give the state a huge windfall
 
01:23:18.770 --> 01:23:18.780 align:start position:0%
appreciate that as far as credit unions
 
01:23:22.070 --> 01:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
go the problem is they can't multiply
 
01:23:24.890 --> 01:23:24.900 align:start position:0%
their money as Banks can
 
01:23:26.570 --> 01:23:26.580 align:start position:0%
so if they have a hundred dollars in
 
01:23:29.990 --> 01:23:30.000 align:start position:0%
their vault they can't now loan out nine
 
01:23:31.669 --> 01:23:31.679 align:start position:0%
times that amount they don't have the
 
01:23:33.770 --> 01:23:33.780 align:start position:0%
reserve requirements aren't 10 like they
 
01:23:35.510 --> 01:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
are for commercial Banks that's the
 
01:23:37.310 --> 01:23:37.320 align:start position:0%
difference does that make any sense so
 
01:23:40.250 --> 01:23:40.260 align:start position:0%
we have we have requirements on you know
 
01:23:41.870 --> 01:23:41.880 align:start position:0%
under our banking statutes that the
 
01:23:43.970 --> 01:23:43.980 align:start position:0%
credit union has to comply with just
 
01:23:47.450 --> 01:23:47.460 align:start position:0%
like any Bank requires okay so when you
 
01:23:51.110 --> 01:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
talk about their resources the money and
 
01:23:53.090 --> 01:23:53.100 align:start position:0%
and the last time I saw this bill not
 
01:23:54.770 --> 01:23:54.780 align:start position:0%
marples bill I don't remember that one
 
01:23:54.780 --> 01:23:55.689 align:start position:0%
marples bill I don't remember that one
but

01:23:55.689 --> 01:23:55.699 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:23:58.550 --> 01:23:58.560 align:start position:0%
representative Valley Frazier put it was
 
01:24:01.189 --> 01:24:01.199 align:start position:0%
was the idea of that if you could take
 
01:24:03.290 --> 01:24:03.300 align:start position:0%
the state's checking account and just
 
01:24:06.050 --> 01:24:06.060 align:start position:0%
put it over there but you can't call
 
01:24:07.610 --> 01:24:07.620 align:start position:0%
that Reserves
 
01:24:09.470 --> 01:24:09.480 align:start position:0%
because that's a moving account that
 
01:24:12.169 --> 01:24:12.179 align:start position:0%
money is going in and out reserves is
 
01:24:15.709 --> 01:24:15.719 align:start position:0%
sunk you know Capital that's in an
 
01:24:15.719 --> 01:24:16.850 align:start position:0%
sunk you know Capital that's in an
institution

01:24:16.850 --> 01:24:16.860 align:start position:0%
institution
 
01:24:19.490 --> 01:24:19.500 align:start position:0%
that's what you need to find is you need
 
01:24:22.070 --> 01:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
to find a hundred million dollars that
 
01:24:24.530 --> 01:24:24.540 align:start position:0%
you can give to this institution
 
01:24:28.490 --> 01:24:28.500 align:start position:0%
and that is their asset then they can
 
01:24:32.090 --> 01:24:32.100 align:start position:0%
loan based on the nine the formula that
 
01:24:34.430 --> 01:24:34.440 align:start position:0%
you're talking about
 
01:24:36.890 --> 01:24:36.900 align:start position:0%
I would I would love to work on that as
 
01:24:38.810 --> 01:24:38.820 align:start position:0%
Mr representative Terry mentioned I
 
01:24:40.070 --> 01:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
would I think we can find it I think
 
01:24:42.350 --> 01:24:42.360 align:start position:0%
it's it's desirable enough and it's it's
 
01:24:44.149 --> 01:24:44.159 align:start position:0%
profitable enough to make it worth the
 
01:24:46.570 --> 01:24:46.580 align:start position:0%
effort fair enough
 
01:24:48.649 --> 01:24:48.659 align:start position:0%
representative Herbert has another
 
01:24:48.659 --> 01:24:49.790 align:start position:0%
representative Herbert has another
question

01:24:49.790 --> 01:24:49.800 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:24:51.649 --> 01:24:51.659 align:start position:0%
would you believe
 
01:24:53.630 --> 01:24:53.640 align:start position:0%
there's actually a book
 
01:24:56.470 --> 01:24:56.480 align:start position:0%
everybody can read about public Banking
 
01:25:00.410 --> 01:25:00.420 align:start position:0%
and it goes beyond just North Dakota
 
01:25:03.590 --> 01:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
so and around the world there are a lot
 
01:25:06.530 --> 01:25:06.540 align:start position:0%
of public Banks there there's common as
 
01:25:10.610 --> 01:25:10.620 align:start position:0%
dirt so it's not a it's not a
 
01:25:13.850 --> 01:25:13.860 align:start position:0%
some sort of strange uh you know balloon
 
01:25:15.229 --> 01:25:15.239 align:start position:0%
in this guy
 
01:25:17.630 --> 01:25:17.640 align:start position:0%
they're all over the place we the United
 
01:25:20.090 --> 01:25:20.100 align:start position:0%
States doesn't have but one
 
01:25:24.950 --> 01:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
and uh I've read the book and I've
 
01:25:28.070 --> 01:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
gone through it but brown brown solution
 
01:25:31.310 --> 01:25:31.320 align:start position:0%
yeah public Bank Solutions but but the
 
01:25:33.530 --> 01:25:33.540 align:start position:0%
point is it's just a bank
 
01:25:37.070 --> 01:25:37.080 align:start position:0%
and it has does banking functions know
 
01:25:38.770 --> 01:25:38.780 align:start position:0%
more differently than
 
01:25:42.169 --> 01:25:42.179 align:start position:0%
the private banking system except that
 
01:25:44.149 --> 01:25:44.159 align:start position:0%
there's a couple of differences and one
 
01:25:46.729 --> 01:25:46.739 align:start position:0%
is the money does stay in the state
 
01:25:49.850 --> 01:25:49.860 align:start position:0%
and number two the priorities on where
 
01:25:51.890 --> 01:25:51.900 align:start position:0%
that money goes goes into Community
 
01:25:55.010 --> 01:25:55.020 align:start position:0%
Banks and and the result of that has
 
01:25:58.129 --> 01:25:58.139 align:start position:0%
been a very strong robust bank one of
 
01:26:00.050 --> 01:26:00.060 align:start position:0%
the best in the country
 
01:26:03.890 --> 01:26:03.900 align:start position:0%
uh and it came 2019 did that happen
 
01:26:06.470 --> 01:26:06.480 align:start position:0%
that's a that's an interesting year was
 
01:26:08.689 --> 01:26:08.699 align:start position:0%
that suffrage okay anyway would you
 
01:26:10.669 --> 01:26:10.679 align:start position:0%
believe the question I think he said no
 
01:26:12.470 --> 01:26:12.480 align:start position:0%
would you believe that he did say that
 
01:26:15.050 --> 01:26:15.060 align:start position:0%
he's not as complicated as some people
 
01:26:19.510 --> 01:26:19.520 align:start position:0%
here obviously think and uh fair enough
 
01:26:22.729 --> 01:26:22.739 align:start position:0%
it's on if I'm if I may just briefly
 
01:26:24.950 --> 01:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
it's unfortunate that banking has been
 
01:26:27.350 --> 01:26:27.360 align:start position:0%
given this shroud of incomprehensibility
 
01:26:30.229 --> 01:26:30.239 align:start position:0%
to anybody that isn't you know initiated
 
01:26:31.490 --> 01:26:31.500 align:start position:0%
in the art
 
01:26:31.500 --> 01:26:33.470 align:start position:0%
in the art
money

01:26:33.470 --> 01:26:33.480 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:26:35.629 --> 01:26:35.639 align:start position:0%
as well as she wrote in the summer books
 
01:26:37.189 --> 01:26:37.199 align:start position:0%
but money is public infrastructure as
 
01:26:39.470 --> 01:26:39.480 align:start position:0%
far as I'm concerned the currency we all
 
01:26:41.390 --> 01:26:41.400 align:start position:0%
need it as it's as important as the
 
01:26:43.010 --> 01:26:43.020 align:start position:0%
roads and it truly is a means of
 
01:26:45.050 --> 01:26:45.060 align:start position:0%
transportation between transactions and
 
01:26:47.390 --> 01:26:47.400 align:start position:0%
I just I don't see why we've
 
01:26:48.770 --> 01:26:48.780 align:start position:0%
essentially gone against the
 
01:26:50.450 --> 01:26:50.460 align:start position:0%
Constitution given this power to these
 
01:26:52.430 --> 01:26:52.440 align:start position:0%
private corporations private Banks
 
01:26:54.050 --> 01:26:54.060 align:start position:0%
including the Federal Reserve so thank
 
01:26:56.570 --> 01:26:56.580 align:start position:0%
you so I would hope this committee since
 
01:26:58.250 --> 01:26:58.260 align:start position:0%
the original name of this committee was
 
01:27:01.610 --> 01:27:01.620 align:start position:0%
banks that I hope we aren't too shrouded
 
01:27:03.709 --> 01:27:03.719 align:start position:0%
in in the secrecy
 
01:27:06.229 --> 01:27:06.239 align:start position:0%
representative Terry Mr chairman uh
 
01:27:08.450 --> 01:27:08.460 align:start position:0%
thank you and for the benefit of the uh
 
01:27:10.310 --> 01:27:10.320 align:start position:0%
tens of thousands who are watching live
 
01:27:13.010 --> 01:27:13.020 align:start position:0%
on YouTube and would not uh be able to
 
01:27:15.890 --> 01:27:15.900 align:start position:0%
uh gain this information
 
01:27:17.570 --> 01:27:17.580 align:start position:0%
um otherwise because I would have
 
01:27:20.270 --> 01:27:20.280 align:start position:0%
mentioned it to you during the break uh
 
01:27:21.649 --> 01:27:21.659 align:start position:0%
your question with respect to credit
 
01:27:23.930 --> 01:27:23.940 align:start position:0%
unions is actually addressed in the
 
01:27:26.209 --> 01:27:26.219 align:start position:0%
document that the sponsor has provided
 
01:27:28.970 --> 01:27:28.980 align:start position:0%
us on an unnumbered page which I think
 
01:27:32.570 --> 01:27:32.580 align:start position:0%
once again underscores uh how important
 
01:27:36.470 --> 01:27:36.480 align:start position:0%
it is that we move to the subcommittee a
 
01:27:38.689 --> 01:27:38.699 align:start position:0%
level consideration and perhaps think
 
01:27:42.410 --> 01:27:42.420 align:start position:0%
about a study committee or a study
 
01:27:44.570 --> 01:27:44.580 align:start position:0%
Commission because here in New Hampshire
 
01:27:46.490 --> 01:27:46.500 align:start position:0%
we don't shoot things down just because
 
01:27:49.970 --> 01:27:49.980 align:start position:0%
they've never been done before thank you
 
01:27:51.649 --> 01:27:51.659 align:start position:0%
that's a would you believe it's a
 
01:27:53.270 --> 01:27:53.280 align:start position:0%
Chinese balloon and representative
 
01:27:53.280 --> 01:27:55.610 align:start position:0%
Chinese balloon and representative
spirit

01:27:55.610 --> 01:27:55.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:58.490 --> 01:27:58.500 align:start position:0%
after it's off the coast
 
01:28:00.590 --> 01:28:00.600 align:start position:0%
I don't think the issue is the fact that
 
01:28:02.390 --> 01:28:02.400 align:start position:0%
it's a bank I don't think that's the
 
01:28:04.129 --> 01:28:04.139 align:start position:0%
issue at all setting up a bank is known
 
01:28:05.990 --> 01:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
people do it all the time it's done all
 
01:28:08.209 --> 01:28:08.219 align:start position:0%
over the place this is another bank and
 
01:28:10.490 --> 01:28:10.500 align:start position:0%
in fact the chairman of this bank has
 
01:28:12.229 --> 01:28:12.239 align:start position:0%
said if you want to set up a public Bank
 
01:28:13.910 --> 01:28:13.920 align:start position:0%
you better hire Bankers because no one
 
01:28:17.330 --> 01:28:17.340 align:start position:0%
else is going to do it right fine
 
01:28:19.850 --> 01:28:19.860 align:start position:0%
the question I have is
 
01:28:24.110 --> 01:28:24.120 align:start position:0%
we have very many established
 
01:28:24.120 --> 01:28:24.770 align:start position:0%
we have very many established
um

01:28:24.770 --> 01:28:24.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:27.350 --> 01:28:27.360 align:start position:0%
organizations or departments within this
 
01:28:29.510 --> 01:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
state that do so many of the things
 
01:28:31.430 --> 01:28:31.440 align:start position:0%
you're talking about
 
01:28:34.370 --> 01:28:34.380 align:start position:0%
and what you're suggesting is tear them
 
01:28:37.070 --> 01:28:37.080 align:start position:0%
all apart and start all over again and
 
01:28:40.550 --> 01:28:40.560 align:start position:0%
do it this other way that's a very huge
 
01:28:40.560 --> 01:28:42.229 align:start position:0%
do it this other way that's a very huge
burden

01:28:42.229 --> 01:28:42.239 align:start position:0%
burden
 
01:28:43.910 --> 01:28:43.920 align:start position:0%
if I
 
01:28:46.430 --> 01:28:46.440 align:start position:0%
would you believe no
 
01:28:49.189 --> 01:28:49.199 align:start position:0%
would you believe me no I would say that
 
01:28:51.590 --> 01:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
this Bank well first off the bill is in
 
01:28:52.610 --> 01:28:52.620 align:start position:0%
your hands
 
01:28:55.610 --> 01:28:55.620 align:start position:0%
you weak you can decide to have this
 
01:28:57.770 --> 01:28:57.780 align:start position:0%
Bank do as little or as much as you want
 
01:29:00.050 --> 01:29:00.060 align:start position:0%
in consultation with I'd say interested
 
01:29:01.729 --> 01:29:01.739 align:start position:0%
parties which is important
 
01:29:04.669 --> 01:29:04.679 align:start position:0%
but I once you start looking at the nuts
 
01:29:06.110 --> 01:29:06.120 align:start position:0%
and bolts of this I think your opinion
 
01:29:07.070 --> 01:29:07.080 align:start position:0%
will change
 
01:29:09.830 --> 01:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
it's it's just very
 
01:29:11.570 --> 01:29:11.580 align:start position:0%
just look into it a little bit I'm just
 
01:29:13.310 --> 01:29:13.320 align:start position:0%
saying I think it has a lot of legs it
 
01:29:14.930 --> 01:29:14.940 align:start position:0%
has a lot it has legs it can do a lot of
 
01:29:20.209 --> 01:29:20.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:24.050 --> 01:29:24.060 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you thank you okay so uh
 
01:29:27.110 --> 01:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
since it is banking day we have the bank
 
01:29:30.229 --> 01:29:30.239 align:start position:0%
commissioner one more time
 
01:29:30.239 --> 01:29:33.470 align:start position:0%
commissioner one more time
foreign

01:29:33.470 --> 01:29:33.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:35.689 --> 01:29:35.699 align:start position:0%
Todd Wells
 
01:29:38.870 --> 01:29:38.880 align:start position:0%
nice to see you Todd
 
01:29:40.669 --> 01:29:40.679 align:start position:0%
good morning again for the record my
 
01:29:42.169 --> 01:29:42.179 align:start position:0%
name is Amelia galderi I'm the bank
 
01:29:43.310 --> 01:29:43.320 align:start position:0%
commissioner for the State of New

Hampshire with me is Chief Bank examiner
 
01:29:48.590 --> 01:29:48.600 align:start position:0%
Todd Wells uh the banking thank you for
 
01:29:49.910 --> 01:29:49.920 align:start position:0%
this opportunity to provide information
 
01:29:52.910 --> 01:29:52.920 align:start position:0%
on this bill the banking department has
 
01:29:55.129 --> 01:29:55.139 align:start position:0%
no position on the bill uh the
 
01:29:56.570 --> 01:29:56.580 align:start position:0%
underlying politics of whether or not to
 
01:29:59.750 --> 01:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
form a State Bank however we are here to
 
01:30:01.370 --> 01:30:01.380 align:start position:0%
answer any questions you might have and
 
01:30:01.380 --> 01:30:02.450 align:start position:0%
answer any questions you might have and
additionally

01:30:02.450 --> 01:30:02.460 align:start position:0%
additionally
 
01:30:02.460 --> 01:30:03.470 align:start position:0%
additionally
um

01:30:03.470 --> 01:30:03.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:05.629 --> 01:30:05.639 align:start position:0%
point out some issues with the bill the
 
01:30:07.610 --> 01:30:07.620 align:start position:0%
way it's drafted and perhaps some
 
01:30:10.070 --> 01:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
general questions that you would need to
 
01:30:12.470 --> 01:30:12.480 align:start position:0%
think about if you wanted to do this I
 
01:30:14.209 --> 01:30:14.219 align:start position:0%
will say that forming a bank is a
 
01:30:16.129 --> 01:30:16.139 align:start position:0%
complicated and expensive process I
 
01:30:18.169 --> 01:30:18.179 align:start position:0%
understand that transparency is
 
01:30:21.590 --> 01:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
important and I do value that but um it
 
01:30:23.270 --> 01:30:23.280 align:start position:0%
is a there are things to think about if
 
01:30:25.070 --> 01:30:25.080 align:start position:0%
you want to do this
 
01:30:26.810 --> 01:30:26.820 align:start position:0%
um so just some general data on public
 
01:30:28.430 --> 01:30:28.440 align:start position:0%
Banks it's probably addressed in the
 
01:30:29.930 --> 01:30:29.940 align:start position:0%
materials that you've already been given
 
01:30:32.689 --> 01:30:32.699 align:start position:0%
but in the last 100 years or so in the
 
01:30:34.729 --> 01:30:34.739 align:start position:0%
United States and Associated territories
 
01:30:38.510 --> 01:30:38.520 align:start position:0%
there have been about 29 public Banks
 
01:30:41.330 --> 01:30:41.340 align:start position:0%
chartered out of the 29 that have been
 
01:30:42.590 --> 01:30:42.600 align:start position:0%
chartered in the last hundred years only
 
01:30:45.830 --> 01:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
two remain one is the Bank of North
 
01:30:47.990 --> 01:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
Dakota I apologize in advance if I say
 
01:30:49.189 --> 01:30:49.199 align:start position:0%
South Dakota I've been saying South
 
01:30:50.930 --> 01:30:50.940 align:start position:0%
Dakota all day it is North Dakota just
 
01:30:52.490 --> 01:30:52.500 align:start position:0%
for the record there are credit card
 
01:30:55.070 --> 01:30:55.080 align:start position:0%
people South Dakota maybe I feel like
 
01:30:56.510 --> 01:30:56.520 align:start position:0%
yeah I don't I don't quite know why
 
01:30:59.090 --> 01:30:59.100 align:start position:0%
where my brain is it is North Dakota
 
01:31:02.450 --> 01:31:02.460 align:start position:0%
and the other remaining
 
01:31:04.850 --> 01:31:04.860 align:start position:0%
America some since the territorial Bank
 
01:31:06.890 --> 01:31:06.900 align:start position:0%
of American Samoa
 
01:31:09.649 --> 01:31:09.659 align:start position:0%
those two banks have something in common
 
01:31:11.870 --> 01:31:11.880 align:start position:0%
about how they were formed both of them
 
01:31:14.570 --> 01:31:14.580 align:start position:0%
were formed with a specific purpose to
 
01:31:17.570 --> 01:31:17.580 align:start position:0%
address a need so my understanding is
 
01:31:19.850 --> 01:31:19.860 align:start position:0%
that in America some American Samoa
 
01:31:22.490 --> 01:31:22.500 align:start position:0%
there is not sufficient access no banks
 
01:31:24.290 --> 01:31:24.300 align:start position:0%
are there so they need a bank to provide
 
01:31:25.729 --> 01:31:25.739 align:start position:0%
services to the people who live there
 
01:31:28.970 --> 01:31:28.980 align:start position:0%
basically in summary I I think a lot of
 
01:31:30.229 --> 01:31:30.239 align:start position:0%
it has been said about the North Dakota
 
01:31:31.910 --> 01:31:31.920 align:start position:0%
Bank but my understanding it's sort of a
 
01:31:33.709 --> 01:31:33.719 align:start position:0%
similar scenario there was like a unique
 
01:31:36.770 --> 01:31:36.780 align:start position:0%
circumstance that was very specific to
 
01:31:40.729 --> 01:31:40.739 align:start position:0%
North Dakota that led to its formation
 
01:31:44.629 --> 01:31:44.639 align:start position:0%
um so just as a data point the other 27
 
01:31:46.010 --> 01:31:46.020 align:start position:0%
banks that have been formed in the last
 
01:31:47.870 --> 01:31:47.880 align:start position:0%
hundred years have all been closed due
 
01:31:50.450 --> 01:31:50.460 align:start position:0%
to either regulatory order
 
01:31:52.610 --> 01:31:52.620 align:start position:0%
um Financial failure or the state just
 
01:31:54.950 --> 01:31:54.960 align:start position:0%
chose to go in a different direction so
 
01:31:56.930 --> 01:31:56.940 align:start position:0%
that's kind of the high level history on
 
01:31:58.550 --> 01:31:58.560 align:start position:0%
public Banks
 
01:31:58.560 --> 01:31:59.209 align:start position:0%
public Banks
um

01:31:59.209 --> 01:31:59.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:02.390 --> 01:32:02.400 align:start position:0%
a big question that needs to be answered
 
01:32:03.649 --> 01:32:03.659 align:start position:0%
um well there's a number of big
 
01:32:05.510 --> 01:32:05.520 align:start position:0%
questions but the two big questions I'd
 
01:32:06.830 --> 01:32:06.840 align:start position:0%
say that need to be answered if you're
 
01:32:09.350 --> 01:32:09.360 align:start position:0%
thinking about forming a public bank is
 
01:32:11.450 --> 01:32:11.460 align:start position:0%
number one will it be subject to the
 
01:32:13.790 --> 01:32:13.800 align:start position:0%
banking Department's regulation and
 
01:32:16.910 --> 01:32:16.920 align:start position:0%
related to that if it is
 
01:32:19.070 --> 01:32:19.080 align:start position:0%
um it would require FDIC insurance and
 
01:32:20.930 --> 01:32:20.940 align:start position:0%
have to comply with the fdic's capital
 
01:32:20.940 --> 01:32:22.070 align:start position:0%
have to comply with the fdic's capital
rules

01:32:22.070 --> 01:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
rules
 
01:32:24.649 --> 01:32:24.659 align:start position:0%
right now if you want to form a private
 
01:32:28.070 --> 01:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
bank a plain vanilla one nothing too
 
01:32:29.930 --> 01:32:29.940 align:start position:0%
complicated I'd say this would probably
 
01:32:32.450 --> 01:32:32.460 align:start position:0%
be in the complicated bucket but if you
 
01:32:33.709 --> 01:32:33.719 align:start position:0%
want to form a plain one you're a
 
01:32:35.629 --> 01:32:35.639 align:start position:0%
private entity wanting to do that you
 
01:32:37.970 --> 01:32:37.980 align:start position:0%
need like some seed money you need
 
01:32:37.980 --> 01:32:38.870 align:start position:0%
need like some seed money you need
probably

01:32:38.870 --> 01:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
probably
 
01:32:41.090 --> 01:32:41.100 align:start position:0%
five million of seed money three up to
 
01:32:43.550 --> 01:32:43.560 align:start position:0%
up to five million of seed money
 
01:32:45.229 --> 01:32:45.239 align:start position:0%
um just to form it just to make the
 
01:32:48.229 --> 01:32:48.239 align:start position:0%
plans get it operational and then to
 
01:32:50.270 --> 01:32:50.280 align:start position:0%
comply with the capital requirements of
 
01:32:52.250 --> 01:32:52.260 align:start position:0%
the FDIC you'd need about 20 to 30
 
01:32:54.229 --> 01:32:54.239 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
01:32:56.930 --> 01:32:56.940 align:start position:0%
um just to get the doors open and FDIC
 
01:32:58.610 --> 01:32:58.620 align:start position:0%
insurance if that's the route you want
 
01:33:00.169 --> 01:33:00.179 align:start position:0%
to go
 
01:33:03.110 --> 01:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
um then after it's formed there's what
 
01:33:05.390 --> 01:33:05.400 align:start position:0%
we call a capital burn so the bank
 
01:33:07.370 --> 01:33:07.380 align:start position:0%
doesn't make money for a while because
 
01:33:09.169 --> 01:33:09.179 align:start position:0%
it's getting up and running it's hiring
 
01:33:11.209 --> 01:33:11.219 align:start position:0%
all the people it's getting the deposits
 
01:33:13.250 --> 01:33:13.260 align:start position:0%
in it's doing all that stuff so you
 
01:33:15.229 --> 01:33:15.239 align:start position:0%
would have a number of years before this
 
01:33:17.930 --> 01:33:17.940 align:start position:0%
bank would be profitable
 
01:33:20.750 --> 01:33:20.760 align:start position:0%
comparing it to a private bank
 
01:33:20.760 --> 01:33:21.290 align:start position:0%
comparing it to a private bank
um

01:33:21.290 --> 01:33:21.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:23.209 --> 01:33:23.219 align:start position:0%
so those are kind of the big picture
 
01:33:23.219 --> 01:33:24.229 align:start position:0%
so those are kind of the big picture
things

01:33:24.229 --> 01:33:24.239 align:start position:0%
things
 
01:33:26.149 --> 01:33:26.159 align:start position:0%
um some other issues kind of
 
01:33:28.729 --> 01:33:28.739 align:start position:0%
tangentially related to that if it's
 
01:33:30.110 --> 01:33:30.120 align:start position:0%
going to be regulated by the New
 
01:33:32.510 --> 01:33:32.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire banking Department first off
 
01:33:33.950 --> 01:33:33.960 align:start position:0%
this bill would need to change to say
 
01:33:37.070 --> 01:33:37.080 align:start position:0%
that very clearly we would be going in
 
01:33:39.110 --> 01:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
and doing examinations we would be
 
01:33:41.570 --> 01:33:41.580 align:start position:0%
charging the entity our examinations our
 
01:33:43.790 --> 01:33:43.800 align:start position:0%
reports of examinations are confidential
 
01:33:43.800 --> 01:33:46.250 align:start position:0%
reports of examinations are confidential
because

01:33:46.250 --> 01:33:46.260 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:33:46.260 --> 01:33:47.629 align:start position:0%
because
um

01:33:47.629 --> 01:33:47.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:50.030 --> 01:33:50.040 align:start position:0%
we want to prevent basically a run on a
 
01:33:52.070 --> 01:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
bank like you want to keep that
 
01:33:53.930 --> 01:33:53.940 align:start position:0%
information is for the bank to come into
 
01:33:55.970 --> 01:33:55.980 align:start position:0%
compliance with laws and rules and those
 
01:33:57.470 --> 01:33:57.480 align:start position:0%
are that's the kind of the policy
 
01:33:59.330 --> 01:33:59.340 align:start position:0%
reasons behind why reports of
 
01:34:00.709 --> 01:34:00.719 align:start position:0%
examination are confidential their
 
01:34:02.270 --> 01:34:02.280 align:start position:0%
private entities performing private
 
01:34:02.280 --> 01:34:03.410 align:start position:0%
private entities performing private
services

01:34:03.410 --> 01:34:03.420 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:34:05.990 --> 01:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
so that's like another wrinkle that you
 
01:34:07.729 --> 01:34:07.739 align:start position:0%
would want to think about if this is the
 
01:34:09.189 --> 01:34:09.199 align:start position:0%
route you want to go
 
01:34:11.330 --> 01:34:11.340 align:start position:0%
another additional thing that I would
 
01:34:13.250 --> 01:34:13.260 align:start position:0%
note is banks that are formed in New
 
01:34:14.209 --> 01:34:14.219 align:start position:0%
Hampshire have to be either a
 
01:34:16.729 --> 01:34:16.739 align:start position:0%
corporation or an LLC under our law so
 
01:34:17.750 --> 01:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
you would need to pick one of those
 
01:34:19.669 --> 01:34:19.679 align:start position:0%
buckets to make it kind of a corporate
 
01:34:19.679 --> 01:34:21.350 align:start position:0%
buckets to make it kind of a corporate
entity

01:34:21.350 --> 01:34:21.360 align:start position:0%
entity
 
01:34:21.360 --> 01:34:21.950 align:start position:0%
entity
um

01:34:21.950 --> 01:34:21.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:23.750 --> 01:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to list off some other
 
01:34:25.910 --> 01:34:25.920 align:start position:0%
things to think about too
 
01:34:25.920 --> 01:34:26.510 align:start position:0%
things to think about too
um

01:34:26.510 --> 01:34:26.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:28.790 --> 01:34:28.800 align:start position:0%
first this the way this bill is set up
 
01:34:30.110 --> 01:34:30.120 align:start position:0%
the bank commissioner would be an
 
01:34:32.629 --> 01:34:32.639 align:start position:0%
ex-officio member of the bank so
 
01:34:34.729 --> 01:34:34.739 align:start position:0%
I can't run the bank and examine the
 
01:34:38.090 --> 01:34:38.100 align:start position:0%
bank that's a conflict additionally
 
01:34:38.100 --> 01:34:38.689 align:start position:0%
bank that's a conflict additionally
um

01:34:38.689 --> 01:34:38.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:40.189 --> 01:34:40.199 align:start position:0%
if the bank is going to provide the
 
01:34:42.649 --> 01:34:42.659 align:start position:0%
services that have been enumerated
 
01:34:45.530 --> 01:34:45.540 align:start position:0%
um it would be the same kind of conflict
 
01:34:47.209 --> 01:34:47.219 align:start position:0%
as the public deposit investment pool
 
01:34:49.070 --> 01:34:49.080 align:start position:0%
that we spoke about earlier
 
01:34:52.550 --> 01:34:52.560 align:start position:0%
I would be examined like basically I
 
01:34:54.050 --> 01:34:54.060 align:start position:0%
would be running a bank that competes
 
01:34:56.510 --> 01:34:56.520 align:start position:0%
with the other banks that I regulate so
 
01:34:59.270 --> 01:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
that conflict would exist again
 
01:34:59.280 --> 01:35:00.169 align:start position:0%
that conflict would exist again
um

01:35:00.169 --> 01:35:00.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:02.270 --> 01:35:02.280 align:start position:0%
let's see there's definitions that
 
01:35:04.610 --> 01:35:04.620 align:start position:0%
conflict with our statutes
 
01:35:06.470 --> 01:35:06.480 align:start position:0%
um I would also say that there would be
 
01:35:08.629 --> 01:35:08.639 align:start position:0%
a similar problem with there seems to be
 
01:35:10.550 --> 01:35:10.560 align:start position:0%
an advisory committee that would consist
 
01:35:13.729 --> 01:35:13.739 align:start position:0%
of Private Bank Bankers so they would
 
01:35:15.649 --> 01:35:15.659 align:start position:0%
also have that conflict they'd be tasked
 
01:35:17.750 --> 01:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
with like running a bank that competes
 
01:35:19.129 --> 01:35:19.139 align:start position:0%
with them
 
01:35:21.050 --> 01:35:21.060 align:start position:0%
um so these are just all things that you
 
01:35:22.310 --> 01:35:22.320 align:start position:0%
need to think about pretty carefully
 
01:35:24.169 --> 01:35:24.179 align:start position:0%
before you do this
 
01:35:24.179 --> 01:35:24.950 align:start position:0%
before you do this
um

01:35:24.950 --> 01:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:28.729 --> 01:35:28.739 align:start position:0%
I could go on and on um I think that's I
 
01:35:30.410 --> 01:35:30.420 align:start position:0%
I Pro I don't want to I don't want to
 
01:35:32.810 --> 01:35:32.820 align:start position:0%
like have you guys all like I'm happy to
 
01:35:34.129 --> 01:35:34.139 align:start position:0%
discuss it and provide any information
 
01:35:35.810 --> 01:35:35.820 align:start position:0%
you may need
 
01:35:38.030 --> 01:35:38.040 align:start position:0%
um but it is a complicated process you
 
01:35:39.110 --> 01:35:39.120 align:start position:0%
need to think about conflicts of
 
01:35:40.310 --> 01:35:40.320 align:start position:0%
interest you need to think about what
 
01:35:42.830 --> 01:35:42.840 align:start position:0%
business the bank is going to do I agree
 
01:35:44.810 --> 01:35:44.820 align:start position:0%
with some of the earlier testimony that
 
01:35:46.250 --> 01:35:46.260 align:start position:0%
a lot of these services are already
 
01:35:47.750 --> 01:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
provided by entities like the public
 
01:35:49.850 --> 01:35:49.860 align:start position:0%
deposit investment pool like you know
 
01:35:51.770 --> 01:35:51.780 align:start position:0%
any of the entities that were already
 
01:35:53.570 --> 01:35:53.580 align:start position:0%
listed so these are all things you need
 
01:35:55.129 --> 01:35:55.139 align:start position:0%
to think about
 
01:35:55.139 --> 01:35:56.209 align:start position:0%
to think about
um

01:35:56.209 --> 01:35:56.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:59.149 --> 01:35:59.159 align:start position:0%
and also I think this is my fourth time
 
01:36:01.189 --> 01:36:01.199 align:start position:0%
hearing about a public bank before the
 
01:36:02.810 --> 01:36:02.820 align:start position:0%
house Commerce Committee and I believe
 
01:36:04.729 --> 01:36:04.739 align:start position:0%
not the last time but the time before
 
01:36:07.070 --> 01:36:07.080 align:start position:0%
that there was an interim study done
 
01:36:09.169 --> 01:36:09.179 align:start position:0%
pretty extensively we dove into it a lot
 
01:36:11.390 --> 01:36:11.400 align:start position:0%
and I think they issued a report
 
01:36:13.729 --> 01:36:13.739 align:start position:0%
um I think representative Frazier was
 
01:36:17.090 --> 01:36:17.100 align:start position:0%
the uh sponsor yeah so I think if if
 
01:36:19.129 --> 01:36:19.139 align:start position:0%
you're looking for that data you can go
 
01:36:21.050 --> 01:36:21.060 align:start position:0%
and review that um report you know how
 
01:36:23.090 --> 01:36:23.100 align:start position:0%
that can be accessed I believe through
 
01:36:24.770 --> 01:36:24.780 align:start position:0%
the website they redid the website so
 
01:36:26.030 --> 01:36:26.040 align:start position:0%
I'll make sure we get that for
 
01:36:29.090 --> 01:36:29.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:33.310 --> 01:36:33.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:37.490 --> 01:36:37.500 align:start position:0%
okay but are you going to ask a question
 
01:36:40.129 --> 01:36:40.139 align:start position:0%
is this yeah sure I can ask one I can
 
01:36:43.010 --> 01:36:43.020 align:start position:0%
ask 50. but but the first one I would
 
01:36:45.350 --> 01:36:45.360 align:start position:0%
say the banks that failed
 
01:36:47.750 --> 01:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
do you know when that happened I don't
 
01:36:49.550 --> 01:36:49.560 align:start position:0%
have a timeline for all of them but I
 
01:36:50.930 --> 01:36:50.940 align:start position:0%
believe it's been studied in various
 
01:36:52.790 --> 01:36:52.800 align:start position:0%
reports so I'm happy to go and get that
 
01:36:55.310 --> 01:36:55.320 align:start position:0%
information for you would you believe I
 
01:36:56.750 --> 01:36:56.760 align:start position:0%
I would think the majority of them
 
01:36:58.790 --> 01:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
happen during the Great Depression when
 
01:37:01.010 --> 01:37:01.020 align:start position:0%
a lot of banks went under
 
01:37:04.129 --> 01:37:04.139 align:start position:0%
the other thing is uh we
 
01:37:04.139 --> 01:37:06.229 align:start position:0%
the other thing is uh we
um

01:37:06.229 --> 01:37:06.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:09.649 --> 01:37:09.659 align:start position:0%
would you believe that a lot of what you
 
01:37:12.950 --> 01:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
just said about changing uh being having
 
01:37:16.070 --> 01:37:16.080 align:start position:0%
conflicts of interest and whatnot
 
01:37:20.330 --> 01:37:20.340 align:start position:0%
this isn't actually a really new bank it
 
01:37:23.750 --> 01:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
it would be formed in such a way as to
 
01:37:26.209 --> 01:37:26.219 align:start position:0%
do the least amount of
 
01:37:28.850 --> 01:37:28.860 align:start position:0%
uh changes in the government you would
 
01:37:30.229 --> 01:37:30.239 align:start position:0%
still be the banking commissioner is
 
01:37:31.850 --> 01:37:31.860 align:start position:0%
this a question
 
01:37:34.550 --> 01:37:34.560 align:start position:0%
would you believe oh it's changing well
 
01:37:37.070 --> 01:37:37.080 align:start position:0%
I mean okay I'll stop you're you're on
 
01:37:38.570 --> 01:37:38.580 align:start position:0%
the Banking Committee yeah so it wasn't
 
01:37:42.350 --> 01:37:42.360 align:start position:0%
you can express all your feelings off my
 
01:37:44.450 --> 01:37:44.460 align:start position:0%
book I know thank you for your question
 
01:37:47.390 --> 01:37:47.400 align:start position:0%
all right everybody else had any other
 
01:37:47.400 --> 01:37:48.350 align:start position:0%
all right everybody else had any other
questions

01:37:48.350 --> 01:37:48.360 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:37:51.470 --> 01:37:51.480 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you I have one
 
01:37:55.070 --> 01:37:55.080 align:start position:0%
more card left Ryan Hale from the evil
 
01:37:56.689 --> 01:37:56.699 align:start position:0%
lobbyist organization called the New
 
01:38:10.430 --> 01:38:10.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:11.810 --> 01:38:11.820 align:start position:0%
well I'll be sure because I think the
 
01:38:13.490 --> 01:38:13.500 align:start position:0%
commissioner did a great job uh
 
01:38:15.649 --> 01:38:15.659 align:start position:0%
highlighting some of the uh some of the
 
01:38:17.750 --> 01:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
concerns that we share
 
01:38:20.990 --> 01:38:21.000 align:start position:0%
um with this bill but uh uh chairman uh
 
01:38:22.669 --> 01:38:22.679 align:start position:0%
honorable members of the House Commerce
 
01:38:24.229 --> 01:38:24.239 align:start position:0%
consumer affairs committee for the
 
01:38:26.330 --> 01:38:26.340 align:start position:0%
record my name is Ryan Hale again vice
 
01:38:27.709 --> 01:38:27.719 align:start position:0%
president of government relations for
 
01:38:31.370 --> 01:38:31.380 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Bankers Association we
 
01:38:33.350 --> 01:38:33.360 align:start position:0%
represent 38 member banks employing
 
01:38:35.570 --> 01:38:35.580 align:start position:0%
roughly 6 000 people
 
01:38:38.030 --> 01:38:38.040 align:start position:0%
um I'm here today to testify in strong
 
01:38:43.610 --> 01:38:43.620 align:start position:0%
opposition to house bills 648 as drafted
 
01:38:46.189 --> 01:38:46.199 align:start position:0%
um and previously mentioned uh this Bank
 
01:38:48.470 --> 01:38:48.480 align:start position:0%
directs a state to establish a state-run
 
01:38:51.050 --> 01:38:51.060 align:start position:0%
bank to take uh public deposits and make
 
01:38:53.450 --> 01:38:53.460 align:start position:0%
loans to public entities not private
 
01:38:56.330 --> 01:38:56.340 align:start position:0%
individuals or legal entities
 
01:39:00.110 --> 01:39:00.120 align:start position:0%
um we heard some uh arguments on why uh
 
01:39:03.410 --> 01:39:03.420 align:start position:0%
this institution uh is needed but the
 
01:39:05.990 --> 01:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
cost potential problems we see are
 
01:39:09.110 --> 01:39:09.120 align:start position:0%
numerous in particular we see this
 
01:39:10.669 --> 01:39:10.679 align:start position:0%
legislation raises several questions
 
01:39:12.950 --> 01:39:12.960 align:start position:0%
which uh we think Warren's particular
 
01:39:15.729 --> 01:39:15.739 align:start position:0%
attention for example
 
01:39:18.709 --> 01:39:18.719 align:start position:0%
is this is there a need for a public
 
01:39:21.770 --> 01:39:21.780 align:start position:0%
State Bank as already mentioned there's
 
01:39:25.970 --> 01:39:25.980 align:start position:0%
many public quasi-government lending
 
01:39:27.590 --> 01:39:27.600 align:start position:0%
agencies within the state we have the
 
01:39:29.030 --> 01:39:29.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire business Finance Authority
 
01:39:31.129 --> 01:39:31.139 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Housing Finance Authority
 
01:39:33.590 --> 01:39:33.600 align:start position:0%
we have the public deposit investment
 
01:39:37.970 --> 01:39:37.980 align:start position:0%
pool all provide services to State and
 
01:39:41.090 --> 01:39:41.100 align:start position:0%
local municipalities
 
01:39:43.070 --> 01:39:43.080 align:start position:0%
um as mentioned also this is the sixth
 
01:39:45.470 --> 01:39:45.480 align:start position:0%
time in the past 15 years this proposal
 
01:39:47.450 --> 01:39:47.460 align:start position:0%
has come up I believe this this proposal
 
01:39:50.570 --> 01:39:50.580 align:start position:0%
is nearly identical to the 2019 proposal
 
01:39:52.610 --> 01:39:52.620 align:start position:0%
which I think failed
 
01:39:54.649 --> 01:39:54.659 align:start position:0%
um uh and committee or received an
 
01:39:56.810 --> 01:39:56.820 align:start position:0%
experience to legislate almost I believe
 
01:39:59.149 --> 01:39:59.159 align:start position:0%
almost if not unanimous recommendation
 
01:40:01.970 --> 01:40:01.980 align:start position:0%
out of this committee there is also
 
01:40:05.030 --> 01:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
um as part of the Cannabis legalization
 
01:40:07.370 --> 01:40:07.380 align:start position:0%
Bill last year there was a State Bank
 
01:40:09.950 --> 01:40:09.960 align:start position:0%
proposal that was put in there
 
01:40:12.169 --> 01:40:12.179 align:start position:0%
um for to establish a State Bank of
 
01:40:13.970 --> 01:40:13.980 align:start position:0%
financial services were not made
 
01:40:17.410 --> 01:40:17.420 align:start position:0%
available to the state in ways and means
 
01:40:21.410 --> 01:40:21.420 align:start position:0%
they quickly removed that provision
 
01:40:23.510 --> 01:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
um after we were we articulated the
 
01:40:28.010 --> 01:40:28.020 align:start position:0%
concerns of establishing a State Bank
 
01:40:30.890 --> 01:40:30.900 align:start position:0%
um the commissioner mentioned uh between
 
01:40:35.510 --> 01:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
2000 or 1917 2017 there were 29 public
 
01:40:38.570 --> 01:40:38.580 align:start position:0%
Banks only two exist today North Dakota
 
01:40:41.390 --> 01:40:41.400 align:start position:0%
as well as American small Bank
 
01:40:43.310 --> 01:40:43.320 align:start position:0%
um again for the reason at the time it
 
01:40:46.729 --> 01:40:46.739 align:start position:0%
was not sufficient banking services
 
01:40:49.910 --> 01:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
uh well the other question we have is
 
01:40:52.790 --> 01:40:52.800 align:start position:0%
will the public funds be insured uh this
 
01:40:55.189 --> 01:40:55.199 align:start position:0%
bill is unclear uh whether or not these
 
01:40:57.410 --> 01:40:57.420 align:start position:0%
funds will be insured uh State Charter
 
01:40:58.669 --> 01:40:58.679 align:start position:0%
banks in New Hampshire required to have
 
01:41:01.610 --> 01:41:01.620 align:start position:0%
FDIC Insurance question comes about is
 
01:41:03.830 --> 01:41:03.840 align:start position:0%
what happens if this Bank fails who's
 
01:41:03.840 --> 01:41:05.450 align:start position:0%
what happens if this Bank fails who's
responsible

01:41:05.450 --> 01:41:05.460 align:start position:0%
responsible
 
01:41:07.610 --> 01:41:07.620 align:start position:0%
um it's our understanding most likely
 
01:41:09.169 --> 01:41:09.179 align:start position:0%
could it would be the taxpayers that
 
01:41:11.750 --> 01:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
would be responsible for failure of that
 
01:41:11.760 --> 01:41:14.110 align:start position:0%
would be responsible for failure of that
bank

01:41:14.110 --> 01:41:14.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:16.550 --> 01:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
uh the commissioner did a good job I
 
01:41:18.110 --> 01:41:18.120 align:start position:0%
think highlighting
 
01:41:20.330 --> 01:41:20.340 align:start position:0%
um the conflicts of interest
 
01:41:23.510 --> 01:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
um one additional is unclear as as the
 
01:41:25.550 --> 01:41:25.560 align:start position:0%
Department's funded by its regulated
 
01:41:25.560 --> 01:41:26.870 align:start position:0%
Department's funded by its regulated
entities

01:41:26.870 --> 01:41:26.880 align:start position:0%
entities
 
01:41:28.370 --> 01:41:28.380 align:start position:0%
um it's unclear would these regulated
 
01:41:30.350 --> 01:41:30.360 align:start position:0%
entities subsidize the cost of the
 
01:41:30.360 --> 01:41:31.250 align:start position:0%
entities subsidize the cost of the
department

01:41:31.250 --> 01:41:31.260 align:start position:0%
department
 
01:41:34.550 --> 01:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
um overseeing the State Bank
 
01:41:34.560 --> 01:41:35.629 align:start position:0%
um overseeing the State Bank
um

01:41:35.629 --> 01:41:35.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:37.790 --> 01:41:37.800 align:start position:0%
that would need to be addressed
 
01:41:40.189 --> 01:41:40.199 align:start position:0%
and then also how much will the bank
 
01:41:42.050 --> 01:41:42.060 align:start position:0%
cost to operate
 
01:41:44.510 --> 01:41:44.520 align:start position:0%
um it's tremendously expensive uh the
 
01:41:48.290 --> 01:41:48.300 align:start position:0%
question about Capital was raised
 
01:41:50.450 --> 01:41:50.460 align:start position:0%
um this bill and there wasn't a fiscal
 
01:41:52.010 --> 01:41:52.020 align:start position:0%
note however if you look back I believe
 
01:41:55.370 --> 01:41:55.380 align:start position:0%
in the 2019 proposal I believe again is
 
01:41:57.890 --> 01:41:57.900 align:start position:0%
nearly identical to this bill
 
01:42:00.050 --> 01:42:00.060 align:start position:0%
um I believe the treasurer's analysis at
 
01:42:01.850 --> 01:42:01.860 align:start position:0%
the time was about 50 million dollars in
 
01:42:05.109 --> 01:42:05.119 align:start position:0%
capital uh for that bank
 
01:42:07.850 --> 01:42:07.860 align:start position:0%
additionally uh the sponsor mentioned
 
01:42:09.590 --> 01:42:09.600 align:start position:0%
the Nelson a Rockefeller Center at
 
01:42:12.050 --> 01:42:12.060 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth they analyzed the 2000 I think
 
01:42:15.109 --> 01:42:15.119 align:start position:0%
16 State Bank and it concluded it would
 
01:42:17.870 --> 01:42:17.880 align:start position:0%
need as much as 63 million in capital to
 
01:42:19.609 --> 01:42:19.619 align:start position:0%
meet the minimum Capital requirements at
 
01:42:21.250 --> 01:42:21.260 align:start position:0%
that time
 
01:42:23.689 --> 01:42:23.699 align:start position:0%
Additionally the California state
 
01:42:25.850 --> 01:42:25.860 align:start position:0%
treasurer and this is very narrowly
 
01:42:27.890 --> 01:42:27.900 align:start position:0%
focused but they commissioned a study
 
01:42:31.669 --> 01:42:31.679 align:start position:0%
back in 2018 they used level 4 Ventures
 
01:42:34.729 --> 01:42:34.739 align:start position:0%
uh to look at establishing a state bank
 
01:42:37.070 --> 01:42:37.080 align:start position:0%
for cannabis and again very narrow but
 
01:42:38.470 --> 01:42:38.480 align:start position:0%
in the end
 
01:42:40.850 --> 01:42:40.860 align:start position:0%
and it speaks to some of the points the
 
01:42:43.370 --> 01:42:43.380 align:start position:0%
commissioner made uh just under a
 
01:42:44.689 --> 01:42:44.699 align:start position:0%
billion dollars would be needed in
 
01:42:46.669 --> 01:42:46.679 align:start position:0%
capital again different different
 
01:42:49.129 --> 01:42:49.139 align:start position:0%
economic environment however
 
01:42:51.410 --> 01:42:51.420 align:start position:0%
um to just illustrate that additionally
 
01:42:53.810 --> 01:42:53.820 align:start position:0%
the bank would lose money for what they
 
01:42:56.870 --> 01:42:56.880 align:start position:0%
said was about 12 years and wouldn't see
 
01:42:59.570 --> 01:42:59.580 align:start position:0%
net dividends for 25 to 30 years after
 
01:43:01.810 --> 01:43:01.820 align:start position:0%
the bank opens its doors
 
01:43:05.629 --> 01:43:05.639 align:start position:0%
so in closing uh actually before or it
 
01:43:07.450 --> 01:43:07.460 align:start position:0%
closed just a couple other
 
01:43:10.070 --> 01:43:10.080 align:start position:0%
points I'd like to make the sponsor had
 
01:43:12.050 --> 01:43:12.060 align:start position:0%
mentioned that this wouldn't compete
 
01:43:14.810 --> 01:43:14.820 align:start position:0%
with st with the banks in the state
 
01:43:18.109 --> 01:43:18.119 align:start position:0%
um I would argue that our State Banks as
 
01:43:21.370 --> 01:43:21.380 align:start position:0%
well as National Banks uh have Public
 
01:43:24.770 --> 01:43:24.780 align:start position:0%
Public Accounts public deposit Municipal
 
01:43:28.129 --> 01:43:28.139 align:start position:0%
deposit accounts and do bank with the
 
01:43:30.490 --> 01:43:30.500 align:start position:0%
state as well as municipalities
 
01:43:33.590 --> 01:43:33.600 align:start position:0%
as far as money leaving the state there
 
01:43:35.629 --> 01:43:35.639 align:start position:0%
was a bill a couple years ago that
 
01:43:37.669 --> 01:43:37.679 align:start position:0%
opened the door to out-of-state
 
01:43:40.070 --> 01:43:40.080 align:start position:0%
chartered Banks coming into the state to
 
01:43:42.470 --> 01:43:42.480 align:start position:0%
take Municipal deposits and one of the
 
01:43:44.149 --> 01:43:44.159 align:start position:0%
things we were concerned with was the
 
01:43:45.770 --> 01:43:45.780 align:start position:0%
money leaving the state so we put a
 
01:43:48.290 --> 01:43:48.300 align:start position:0%
lending test in we we worked with the
 
01:43:50.270 --> 01:43:50.280 align:start position:0%
sponsor to include a lending test
 
01:43:54.709 --> 01:43:54.719 align:start position:0%
requiring that that the bank these out
 
01:43:56.629 --> 01:43:56.639 align:start position:0%
of state Charter Banks must lend equal
 
01:43:59.750 --> 01:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
to the amount of deposits they take to
 
01:44:01.669 --> 01:44:01.679 align:start position:0%
ensure the money is invested back in New
 
01:44:04.070 --> 01:44:04.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I think the last thing is
 
01:44:08.050 --> 01:44:08.060 align:start position:0%
when a bank is a or bank takes Municipal
 
01:44:10.850 --> 01:44:10.860 align:start position:0%
State funds public funds they have a
 
01:44:13.550 --> 01:44:13.560 align:start position:0%
fiduciary responsibility to ensure
 
01:44:15.649 --> 01:44:15.659 align:start position:0%
um you know to to the to the state to
 
01:44:18.470 --> 01:44:18.480 align:start position:0%
the municipality so in closing for all
 
01:44:21.050 --> 01:44:21.060 align:start position:0%
the reasons I listed uh we're in strong
 
01:44:24.229 --> 01:44:24.239 align:start position:0%
opposition to House Bill 648
 
01:44:27.950 --> 01:44:27.960 align:start position:0%
um it's it's uh
 
01:44:31.790 --> 01:44:31.800 align:start position:0%
uh you know it's expensive it's risky
 
01:44:33.830 --> 01:44:33.840 align:start position:0%
and I would respectfully ask the
 
01:44:35.990 --> 01:44:36.000 align:start position:0%
committee to do as this committee has
 
01:44:38.149 --> 01:44:38.159 align:start position:0%
done in the past and move in expedient
 
01:44:39.709 --> 01:44:39.719 align:start position:0%
to legislative I'm happy to take any
 
01:44:41.450 --> 01:44:41.460 align:start position:0%
questions the committee may have and I
 
01:44:43.370 --> 01:44:43.380 align:start position:0%
do have written testimony that I will
 
01:44:45.169 --> 01:44:45.179 align:start position:0%
hand out clerk appreciates that yes
 
01:44:47.090 --> 01:44:47.100 align:start position:0%
sorry I forgot to mention that at the
 
01:44:48.950 --> 01:44:48.960 align:start position:0%
beginning but I do ever in testimony
 
01:44:48.960 --> 01:44:49.970 align:start position:0%
beginning but I do ever in testimony
okay

01:44:49.970 --> 01:44:49.980 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:44:53.270 --> 01:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
any questions oh my God representative
 
01:44:55.010 --> 01:44:55.020 align:start position:0%
and you really have a question this time
 
01:44:56.990 --> 01:44:57.000 align:start position:0%
do you and I don't know if you know the
 
01:44:59.090 --> 01:44:59.100 align:start position:0%
answer to this question but uh
 
01:45:03.709 --> 01:45:03.719 align:start position:0%
there is a a lot of deposits of
 
01:45:06.410 --> 01:45:06.420 align:start position:0%
State monies are City monies Municipal
 
01:45:09.470 --> 01:45:09.480 align:start position:0%
monies here and there and everywhere and
 
01:45:11.450 --> 01:45:11.460 align:start position:0%
they're scattered in
 
01:45:13.250 --> 01:45:13.260 align:start position:0%
I was just wondering maybe the
 
01:45:15.830 --> 01:45:15.840 align:start position:0%
commissioner can answer this is what is
 
01:45:18.229 --> 01:45:18.239 align:start position:0%
the largest single deposit of public
 
01:45:18.239 --> 01:45:20.870 align:start position:0%
the largest single deposit of public
money

01:45:20.870 --> 01:45:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:25.609 --> 01:45:25.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:27.830 --> 01:45:27.840 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question
 
01:45:31.250 --> 01:45:31.260 align:start position:0%
um I do not know the answer to uh the
 
01:45:36.350 --> 01:45:36.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:36.360 --> 01:45:38.390 align:start position:0%
 
but

01:45:38.390 --> 01:45:38.400 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:45:38.400 --> 01:45:39.729 align:start position:0%
but
okay

01:45:39.729 --> 01:45:39.739 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:45:42.649 --> 01:45:42.659 align:start position:0%
anybody else we're all set
 
01:45:45.470 --> 01:45:45.480 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you I have no
 
01:45:47.209 --> 01:45:47.219 align:start position:0%
more cards
 
01:45:50.229 --> 01:45:50.239 align:start position:0%
anybody else want to testify seeing none
 
01:45:52.669 --> 01:45:52.679 align:start position:0%
we close the public hearing on House
 
01:45:54.830 --> 01:45:54.840 align:start position:0%
Bill 648 and we'll send it to the
 
01:46:17.270 --> 01:46:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:17.280 --> 01:46:22.490 align:start position:0%
 
yet

01:46:22.490 --> 01:46:22.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:22.500 --> 01:46:27.129 align:start position:0%
 
eventually

01:46:27.129 --> 01:46:27.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:53.470 --> 01:46:53.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:15.290 --> 01:47:15.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:15.300 --> 01:47:19.689 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:47:19.689 --> 01:47:19.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:46.689 --> 01:47:46.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:02.530 --> 01:48:02.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:08.930 --> 01:48:08.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:30.649 --> 01:48:30.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:30.659 --> 01:48:44.930 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:48:44.930 --> 01:48:44.940 align:start position:0%

03:21:36.830 --> 03:21:36.840 align:start position:0%
so this um past year I was on two study
 
03:21:39.110 --> 03:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
committees the first one we did this
 
03:21:40.910 --> 03:21:40.920 align:start position:0%
morning the public deposit investment
 
03:21:40.920 --> 03:21:42.230 align:start position:0%
morning the public deposit investment
pool

03:21:42.230 --> 03:21:42.240 align:start position:0%
pool
 
03:21:44.809 --> 03:21:44.819 align:start position:0%
and then I'm also appointed to the his
 
03:21:47.330 --> 03:21:47.340 align:start position:0%
history committee
 
03:21:50.330 --> 03:21:50.340 align:start position:0%
and um and David Welch who used to be on
 
03:21:53.330 --> 03:21:53.340 align:start position:0%
but he didn't run so I'm now
 
03:21:56.150 --> 03:21:56.160 align:start position:0%
I'm now on I'm not supposed to know the
 
03:21:58.730 --> 03:21:58.740 align:start position:0%
history of this building and well this
 
03:22:02.450 --> 03:22:02.460 align:start position:0%
is a post office but the state house and
 
03:22:04.550 --> 03:22:04.560 align:start position:0%
um so my one of my very first meetings
 
03:22:07.849 --> 03:22:07.859 align:start position:0%
uh the subject of liquor came up and
 
03:22:09.410 --> 03:22:09.420 align:start position:0%
they said aren't you aren't they glad
 
03:22:13.309 --> 03:22:13.319 align:start position:0%
that I'm here and so so uh what you're
 
03:22:17.809 --> 03:22:17.819 align:start position:0%
going to learn now is uh uh a another
 
03:22:21.170 --> 03:22:21.180 align:start position:0%
inside Department inside baseball type
 
03:22:24.469 --> 03:22:24.479 align:start position:0%
issue of how the liquor committee helps
 
03:22:35.210 --> 03:22:35.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:37.429 --> 03:22:37.439 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah so I just saw I'm clear
 
03:22:42.110 --> 03:22:42.120 align:start position:0%
we're talking about 248. 248 okay right
 
03:22:43.849 --> 03:22:43.859 align:start position:0%
so yeah I believe the intent of this
 
03:22:46.490 --> 03:22:46.500 align:start position:0%
bill is um as you all know we have our
 
03:22:48.590 --> 03:22:48.600 align:start position:0%
commemorative bottles
 
03:22:50.330 --> 03:22:50.340 align:start position:0%
um that come out and I believe the
 
03:22:53.269 --> 03:22:53.279 align:start position:0%
intent of this bill is to allow the
 
03:22:55.910 --> 03:22:55.920 align:start position:0%
legislative historical committee to use
 
03:22:57.650 --> 03:22:57.660 align:start position:0%
that money for
 
03:22:57.660 --> 03:22:58.370 align:start position:0%
that money for
um

03:22:58.370 --> 03:22:58.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:23:01.250 --> 03:23:01.260 align:start position:0%
for other responsibilities
 
03:23:02.929 --> 03:23:02.939 align:start position:0%
um as you can see the the language here
 
03:23:05.210 --> 03:23:05.220 align:start position:0%
that's deleted is
 
03:23:05.220 --> 03:23:06.170 align:start position:0%
that's deleted is
um

03:23:06.170 --> 03:23:06.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:23:09.469 --> 03:23:09.479 align:start position:0%
relative to directing funds towards the
 
03:23:12.650 --> 03:23:12.660 align:start position:0%
preservation of the Hall of flags and
 
03:23:14.330 --> 03:23:14.340 align:start position:0%
this would simply allow them to use that
 
03:23:18.229 --> 03:23:18.239 align:start position:0%
money for for other instances
 
03:23:20.990 --> 03:23:21.000 align:start position:0%
right the the problem was it was limited
 
03:23:23.090 --> 03:23:23.100 align:start position:0%
to the hall of flags the fund was
 
03:23:25.190 --> 03:23:25.200 align:start position:0%
already existing so we want to expand
 
03:23:28.130 --> 03:23:28.140 align:start position:0%
broaden its capabilities correct because
 
03:23:29.510 --> 03:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
it's kind of hard to put the Hall of
 
03:23:32.330 --> 03:23:32.340 align:start position:0%
flags in a commemorative bottle that's
 
03:23:36.769 --> 03:23:36.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:36.779 --> 03:23:39.590 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

03:23:39.590 --> 03:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:43.910 --> 03:23:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:43.920 --> 03:23:47.750 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:23:47.750 --> 03:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:51.050 --> 03:23:51.060 align:start position:0%
so any questions uh in terms of the
 
03:23:52.190 --> 03:23:52.200 align:start position:0%
intent of this bill it's pretty
 
03:23:52.200 --> 03:23:55.190 align:start position:0%
intent of this bill it's pretty
straightforward

03:23:55.190 --> 03:23:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:58.729 --> 03:23:58.739 align:start position:0%
to see none thank you very much
 
03:24:02.090 --> 03:24:02.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:02.100 --> 03:24:07.790 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:24:07.790 --> 03:24:07.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:09.229 --> 03:24:09.239 align:start position:0%
chairman would you like us to stay up
 
03:24:13.130 --> 03:24:13.140 align:start position:0%
here for 407 or why not
 
03:24:16.190 --> 03:24:16.200 align:start position:0%
oh okay I have the gavel hasn't hit yet
 
03:24:16.200 --> 03:24:17.510 align:start position:0%
oh okay I have the gavel hasn't hit yet
okay

03:24:17.510 --> 03:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:24:20.030 --> 03:24:20.040 align:start position:0%
um the bottles themselves
 
03:24:24.170 --> 03:24:24.180 align:start position:0%
um who who selects the designs who or
 
03:24:28.429 --> 03:24:28.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:32.090 --> 03:24:32.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:34.370 --> 03:24:34.380 align:start position:0%
um I apologize I don't actually know the
 
03:24:35.809 --> 03:24:35.819 align:start position:0%
answer to that
 
03:24:37.490 --> 03:24:37.500 align:start position:0%
um but I can we can certainly get that
 
03:24:38.750 --> 03:24:38.760 align:start position:0%
for you
 
03:24:38.760 --> 03:24:39.410 align:start position:0%
for you
um

03:24:39.410 --> 03:24:39.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:24:42.830 --> 03:24:42.840 align:start position:0%
that's more done by the commission side
 
03:24:44.690 --> 03:24:44.700 align:start position:0%
in the Marketing Group so I'll have to
 
03:24:46.309 --> 03:24:46.319 align:start position:0%
talk with them to see who actually is
 
03:24:47.929 --> 03:24:47.939 align:start position:0%
the one that chooses those and Designs
 
03:24:49.610 --> 03:24:49.620 align:start position:0%
those so yeah just make sure the
 
03:24:50.690 --> 03:24:50.700 align:start position:0%
marketing is there when we do the
 
03:24:53.030 --> 03:24:53.040 align:start position:0%
subcommittee okay okay I can definitely
 
03:24:55.250 --> 03:24:55.260 align:start position:0%
do that because I we all want to know
 
03:24:57.290 --> 03:24:57.300 align:start position:0%
where it really comes from
 
03:25:04.429 --> 03:25:04.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:06.650 --> 03:25:06.660 align:start position:0%
um well I was I was kind of hoping it
 
03:25:10.809 --> 03:25:10.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:13.729 --> 03:25:13.739 align:start position:0%
Sazerac right Tesseract should make it
 
03:25:16.070 --> 03:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
yes but I don't think they do but I

thank you chairman and committee members
 
03:30:02.630 --> 03:30:02.640 align:start position:0%
uh the HB 407 uh is a bill that has six
 
03:30:05.389 --> 03:30:05.399 align:start position:0%
parts to it and really it is just
 
03:30:07.429 --> 03:30:07.439 align:start position:0%
addressing some of the
 
03:30:09.410 --> 03:30:09.420 align:start position:0%
um inconsistencies that have developed
 
03:30:12.469 --> 03:30:12.479 align:start position:0%
uh from other Law changes over the year
 
03:30:13.969 --> 03:30:13.979 align:start position:0%
um I can bring you through each of the
 
03:30:16.729 --> 03:30:16.739 align:start position:0%
sections uh they will move quite quickly
 
03:30:19.610 --> 03:30:19.620 align:start position:0%
starting with Section number one
 
03:30:23.090 --> 03:30:23.100 align:start position:0%
it inserts illegal into paragraph six to
 
03:30:24.590 --> 03:30:24.600 align:start position:0%
read license sheet shall not allow
 
03:30:27.170 --> 03:30:27.180 align:start position:0%
illegal gambling or wagering on their
 
03:30:28.849 --> 03:30:28.859 align:start position:0%
license premises
 
03:30:31.070 --> 03:30:31.080 align:start position:0%
licensees throughout the state are
 
03:30:32.630 --> 03:30:32.640 align:start position:0%
currently authorized to conduct gambling
 
03:30:34.190 --> 03:30:34.200 align:start position:0%
operations on their licensed premise
 
03:30:36.290 --> 03:30:36.300 align:start position:0%
through New Hampshire Lottery Commission
 
03:30:38.929 --> 03:30:38.939 align:start position:0%
so this just inserts the word illegal to
 
03:30:40.910 --> 03:30:40.920 align:start position:0%
prohibit illegal gambling charitable
 
03:30:43.070 --> 03:30:43.080 align:start position:0%

03:30:48.110 --> 03:30:48.120 align:start position:0%
exactly the charitable gaming yeah
 
03:30:50.809 --> 03:30:50.819 align:start position:0%
um section number two
 
03:30:53.210 --> 03:30:53.220 align:start position:0%
is in reference to employment employment
 
03:30:55.729 --> 03:30:55.739 align:start position:0%
of minors in felon exceptions
 
03:30:57.590 --> 03:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
it removes language in paragraph four
 
03:30:59.570 --> 03:30:59.580 align:start position:0%
pertaining to designated persons in
 
03:31:01.250 --> 03:31:01.260 align:start position:0%
charge being required to complete an
 
03:31:03.110 --> 03:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
affidavit and file the affidavit with a
 
03:31:06.410 --> 03:31:06.420 align:start position:0%
commission in 2018 paragraphs five and
 
03:31:08.090 --> 03:31:08.100 align:start position:0%
six were repealed from the statute
 
03:31:10.309 --> 03:31:10.319 align:start position:0%
making it no longer a requirement for
 
03:31:11.870 --> 03:31:11.880 align:start position:0%
employees to obtain a felon waiver
 
03:31:11.880 --> 03:31:13.309 align:start position:0%
employees to obtain a felon waiver
exception

03:31:13.309 --> 03:31:13.319 align:start position:0%
exception
 
03:31:15.349 --> 03:31:15.359 align:start position:0%
the existing language requires an
 
03:31:17.809 --> 03:31:17.819 align:start position:0%
employee to file an affidavit a testing
 
03:31:19.790 --> 03:31:19.800 align:start position:0%
they have not been convicted of a felony
 
03:31:23.090 --> 03:31:23.100 align:start position:0%
with no way to provide for an exception
 
03:31:25.010 --> 03:31:25.020 align:start position:0%
this language is no longer required in
 
03:31:26.750 --> 03:31:26.760 align:start position:0%
the statute since the intent of the 2018
 
03:31:28.849 --> 03:31:28.859 align:start position:0%
change was to allow employees with
 
03:31:31.210 --> 03:31:31.220 align:start position:0%
felony convictions to be employees
 
03:31:34.610 --> 03:31:34.620 align:start position:0%
without exception
 
03:31:38.090 --> 03:31:38.100 align:start position:0%
I will note too that the uh upon passage
 
03:31:40.429 --> 03:31:40.439 align:start position:0%
of this bill the administrative's rules
 
03:31:43.130 --> 03:31:43.140 align:start position:0%
will be updated to reflect those changes
 
03:31:45.889 --> 03:31:45.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:49.849 --> 03:31:49.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:53.150 --> 03:31:53.160 align:start position:0%
pertains to 178 22 on-premises cocktail
 
03:31:56.570 --> 03:31:56.580 align:start position:0%
lounge licenses licensees and this
 
03:31:58.670 --> 03:31:58.680 align:start position:0%
simply removes duplic duplicative
 
03:32:01.969 --> 03:32:01.979 align:start position:0%
language quote unquote and Lounge from
 
03:32:09.590 --> 03:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:13.370 --> 03:32:13.380 align:start position:0%
so is this rewriting of Q or that is Q
 
03:32:14.990 --> 03:32:15.000 align:start position:0%
already in statue
 
03:32:17.750 --> 03:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
Q's already in statute just striking out
 
03:32:21.290 --> 03:32:21.300 align:start position:0%
the in Lodge twice written twice
 
03:32:24.349 --> 03:32:24.359 align:start position:0%
how could
 
03:32:26.090 --> 03:32:26.100 align:start position:0%
section number four
 
03:32:29.150 --> 03:32:29.160 align:start position:0%
is in reference to RSA 178 26 additional

03:32:32.809 --> 03:32:32.819 align:start position:0%
and in paragraph one uh this bill
 
03:32:34.910 --> 03:32:34.920 align:start position:0%
inserts the Nano Brewery license with
 
03:32:36.710 --> 03:32:36.720 align:start position:0%
other manufacturers who produce
 
03:32:39.530 --> 03:32:39.540 align:start position:0%
beverages relative to the fees at 30
 
03:32:41.450 --> 03:32:41.460 align:start position:0%
cents a gallon of sales and penalties
 
03:32:43.910 --> 03:32:43.920 align:start position:0%
for failure to pay those fees in
 
03:32:46.550 --> 03:32:46.560 align:start position:0%
paragraph two it will insert the Nano
 
03:32:47.750 --> 03:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
Brewery license with the other
 
03:32:49.570 --> 03:32:49.580 align:start position:0%

the 10th day of the month covering sales
 
03:32:57.950 --> 03:32:57.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:59.990 --> 03:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
essentially it's creating parity with
 
03:33:01.550 --> 03:33:01.560 align:start position:0%
the other manufacturers who produce
 
03:33:01.560 --> 03:33:05.630 align:start position:0%

an on sale restaurant license combined
 
03:33:56.630 --> 03:33:56.640 align:start position:0%

03:36:23.690 --> 03:36:23.700 align:start position:0%
Newington New Hampton and landaf with
 
03:36:27.830 --> 03:36:27.840 align:start position:0%
exceptions pursuant to RSA 541a39 all
 
03:36:29.750 --> 03:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
municipalities are contacted by the
 
03:36:31.429 --> 03:36:31.439 align:start position:0%
division to allow reasonable opportunity
 
03:36:33.650 --> 03:36:33.660 align:start position:0%
to submit data views and comments with
 
03:36:35.389 --> 03:36:35.399 align:start position:0%
respect to the issuance of the permit
 
03:36:37.070 --> 03:36:37.080 align:start position:0%
license or any action within its
 
03:36:38.450 --> 03:36:38.460 align:start position:0%
boundaries that directly affects the
 
03:36:40.550 --> 03:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
municipality so just like the prior
 
03:36:43.309 --> 03:36:43.319 align:start position:0%
statute change this would apply for the
 
03:36:45.650 --> 03:36:45.660 align:start position:0%
same you just said New Hampton I see
 
03:36:48.110 --> 03:36:48.120 align:start position:0%
Newington Newington New Hampton and
 
03:36:51.229 --> 03:36:51.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:54.050 --> 03:36:54.060 align:start position:0%
oh okay
 
03:36:54.060 --> 03:36:56.090 align:start position:0%
oh okay
Newington

03:36:56.090 --> 03:36:56.100 align:start position:0%
Newington
 
03:36:59.929 --> 03:36:59.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:01.969 --> 03:37:01.979 align:start position:0%
the current statute does happen you're
 
03:37:04.070 --> 03:37:04.080 align:start position:0%
taking Hampton because they've
 
03:37:05.889 --> 03:37:05.899 align:start position:0%
they now have a
 
03:37:08.269 --> 03:37:08.279 align:start position:0%
off-premise licensee now
 
03:37:12.650 --> 03:37:12.660 align:start position:0%
yes they all do the it this should read
 
03:37:17.389 --> 03:37:17.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:17.399 --> 03:37:31.670 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:37:31.670 --> 03:37:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:33.710 --> 03:37:33.720 align:start position:0%
so that's New Hampton right
 
03:37:36.050 --> 03:37:36.060 align:start position:0%
Newington the way the statue currently
 
03:37:38.269 --> 03:37:38.279 align:start position:0%
reads is the towns of Newington New
 
03:37:44.450 --> 03:37:44.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:44.460 --> 03:37:47.210 align:start position:0%
 
M okay

03:37:47.210 --> 03:37:47.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:49.670 --> 03:37:49.680 align:start position:0%
so a couple things for the committee
 
03:37:52.790 --> 03:37:52.800 align:start position:0%
this is actually great to see how a
 
03:37:53.929 --> 03:37:53.939 align:start position:0%
section of the bills these little
 
03:37:55.490 --> 03:37:55.500 align:start position:0%
numbers there I remember for years I
 
03:37:56.570 --> 03:37:56.580 align:start position:0%
couldn't figure out why those little
 
03:37:58.790 --> 03:37:58.800 align:start position:0%
numbers were there and then it's because
 
03:38:01.550 --> 03:38:01.560 align:start position:0%
it really is a separate section of the
 
03:38:04.550 --> 03:38:04.560 align:start position:0%
bill and and it's a disconnect that each
 
03:38:07.250 --> 03:38:07.260 align:start position:0%
one is a different RSA that are mending
 
03:38:09.650 --> 03:38:09.660 align:start position:0%
so uh whenever you see a bill like this
 
03:38:12.110 --> 03:38:12.120 align:start position:0%
where it has five or six sections now
 
03:38:13.729 --> 03:38:13.739 align:start position:0%
you say oh my God this is a nightmare
 
03:38:16.330 --> 03:38:16.340 align:start position:0%
because now I've got to take the statute
 
03:38:20.269 --> 03:38:20.279 align:start position:0%
and figure out how where they fit into
 
03:38:22.969 --> 03:38:22.979 align:start position:0%
the statue you know which we obviously
 
03:38:25.610 --> 03:38:25.620 align:start position:0%
don't see uh when they're doing this so
 
03:38:28.130 --> 03:38:28.140 align:start position:0%
that I remember doing that and that
 
03:38:29.389 --> 03:38:29.399 align:start position:0%
actually believe it or not I actually
 
03:38:31.790 --> 03:38:31.800 align:start position:0%
bought the rsas I used to get the rsas
 
03:38:33.469 --> 03:38:33.479 align:start position:0%
this has been long before they were on
 
03:38:36.830 --> 03:38:36.840 align:start position:0%
the computer and uh and then I
 
03:38:38.809 --> 03:38:38.819 align:start position:0%
um so I could actually follow along
 
03:38:42.530 --> 03:38:42.540 align:start position:0%
because in the old days I couldn't but
 
03:38:45.110 --> 03:38:45.120 align:start position:0%
okay so we need an amendment for New
 
03:38:45.120 --> 03:38:49.490 align:start position:0%
okay so we need an amendment for New
Hampton

03:38:49.490 --> 03:38:49.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:51.650 --> 03:38:51.660 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee members
 
03:38:51.660 --> 03:38:53.269 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee members
representing

03:38:53.269 --> 03:38:53.279 align:start position:0%
representing
 
03:38:53.279 --> 03:38:54.410 align:start position:0%
representing
polio

03:38:54.410 --> 03:38:54.420 align:start position:0%
polio
 
03:38:57.050 --> 03:38:57.060 align:start position:0%
oh good
 
03:38:59.929 --> 03:38:59.939 align:start position:0%
um number it's at the top uh line three
 
03:39:01.729 --> 03:39:01.739 align:start position:0%
uh Roman numeral
 
03:39:04.490 --> 03:39:04.500 align:start position:0%
um six licensees shall not allow illegal
 
03:39:07.070 --> 03:39:07.080 align:start position:0%
gambling or wagering on their premises
 
03:39:11.170 --> 03:39:11.180 align:start position:0%
can you expand on that I mean it's just
 
03:39:13.490 --> 03:39:13.500 align:start position:0%
liquor licensees
 
03:39:15.590 --> 03:39:15.600 align:start position:0%
he can't
 
03:39:17.690 --> 03:39:17.700 align:start position:0%
so the way that the current statute
 
03:39:19.250 --> 03:39:19.260 align:start position:0%
reads and thank you representative the
 
03:39:20.750 --> 03:39:20.760 align:start position:0%
way the current statute reads is
 
03:39:22.490 --> 03:39:22.500 align:start position:0%
licensees shall not allow gambling or
 
03:39:24.170 --> 03:39:24.180 align:start position:0%
wagering on their premises
 
03:39:24.180 --> 03:39:24.910 align:start position:0%
wagering on their premises
so

03:39:24.910 --> 03:39:24.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:39:27.469 --> 03:39:27.479 align:start position:0%
there's many licensees throughout the
 
03:39:28.910 --> 03:39:28.920 align:start position:0%
state through New Hampshire lottery
 
03:39:31.250 --> 03:39:31.260 align:start position:0%
commissioned or racing and charitable
 
03:39:34.550 --> 03:39:34.560 align:start position:0%
gaming who issue issues those charitable
 
03:39:38.150 --> 03:39:38.160 align:start position:0%
gaming licenses which is gambling
 
03:39:40.490 --> 03:39:40.500 align:start position:0%
so gambling is a defined term in their
 
03:39:44.090 --> 03:39:44.100 align:start position:0%
statutes and it puts it
 
03:39:46.250 --> 03:39:46.260 align:start position:0%
this portion of the statute puts it in
 
03:39:47.750 --> 03:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
direct conflict with
 
03:39:50.450 --> 03:39:50.460 align:start position:0%
what they're issuing so by inserting the
 
03:39:52.849 --> 03:39:52.859 align:start position:0%
word illegal of course that is legal
 
03:39:55.610 --> 03:39:55.620 align:start position:0%
gambling this would just limit the
 
03:40:01.070 --> 03:40:01.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:06.469 --> 03:40:06.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:08.330 --> 03:40:08.340 align:start position:0%
casinos in the state
 
03:40:12.229 --> 03:40:12.239 align:start position:0%
yes there are but they're not casinos as
 
03:40:15.229 --> 03:40:15.239 align:start position:0%
you would you know yeah yeah because no
 
03:40:16.969 --> 03:40:16.979 align:start position:0%
they're charitable they're charitable
 
03:40:18.170 --> 03:40:18.180 align:start position:0%
they're charitable they're terrible but
 
03:40:19.790 --> 03:40:19.800 align:start position:0%
they are called some of them are called
 
03:40:21.229 --> 03:40:21.239 align:start position:0%
casinos you definitely call them because
 
03:40:23.630 --> 03:40:23.640 align:start position:0%
yes but they're all charitable gaming
 
03:40:25.130 --> 03:40:25.140 align:start position:0%
that's how they're licensed through New
 
03:40:26.570 --> 03:40:26.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Lottery
 
03:40:30.309 --> 03:40:30.319 align:start position:0%
and they don't have slot machines or
 
03:40:33.050 --> 03:40:33.060 align:start position:0%
I don't think they do actually well
 
03:40:36.650 --> 03:40:36.660 align:start position:0%
there's a commercial that's coming soon
 
03:40:40.550 --> 03:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
really do we allow that no
 
03:40:42.650 --> 03:40:42.660 align:start position:0%
okay not yet I didn't think so I don't
 
03:40:44.630 --> 03:40:44.640 align:start position:0%
think I I didn't think I don't know the
 
03:40:46.370 --> 03:40:46.380 align:start position:0%
specific parameters of the charitable
 
03:40:49.070 --> 03:40:49.080 align:start position:0%
gaming license I'm not sure that they're
 
03:40:51.950 --> 03:40:51.960 align:start position:0%
actually called slot machines yeah
 
03:40:54.889 --> 03:40:54.899 align:start position:0%
that's why they might look like yeah I
 
03:40:57.290 --> 03:40:57.300 align:start position:0%
don't know the the oh I know they're the
 
03:41:00.309 --> 03:41:00.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:02.510 --> 03:41:02.520 align:start position:0%
historic horse racing but they're on
 
03:41:04.670 --> 03:41:04.680 align:start position:0%
they're on the TV rather than you're
 
03:41:07.010 --> 03:41:07.020 align:start position:0%
sharing it yeah but again it's something
 
03:41:09.170 --> 03:41:09.180 align:start position:0%
that we allow now with the charitable
 
03:41:09.180 --> 03:41:10.370 align:start position:0%
that we allow now with the charitable
gaming

03:41:10.370 --> 03:41:10.380 align:start position:0%
gaming
 
03:41:12.950 --> 03:41:12.960 align:start position:0%
and just uh another question about
 
03:41:14.750 --> 03:41:14.760 align:start position:0%
social clubs
 
03:41:17.150 --> 03:41:17.160 align:start position:0%
Social Clubs they do gamble there
 
03:41:19.130 --> 03:41:19.140 align:start position:0%
because they have this tickets do you
 
03:41:22.010 --> 03:41:22.020 align:start position:0%
govern the tickets we do not that is all
 
03:41:23.090 --> 03:41:23.100 align:start position:0%
done through the New Hampshire Lottery
 
03:41:25.490 --> 03:41:25.500 align:start position:0%
Commission too but they are all licensed
 
03:41:26.809 --> 03:41:26.819 align:start position:0%
to do that yes
 
03:41:26.819 --> 03:41:28.070 align:start position:0%
to do that yes
and

03:41:28.070 --> 03:41:28.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:41:29.809 --> 03:41:29.819 align:start position:0%
um follow-up for the question one more
 
03:41:29.819 --> 03:41:31.190 align:start position:0%
um follow-up for the question one more
time

03:41:31.190 --> 03:41:31.200 align:start position:0%
time
 
03:41:31.200 --> 03:41:32.090 align:start position:0%
time
um

03:41:32.090 --> 03:41:32.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:41:34.130 --> 03:41:34.140 align:start position:0%
does the Liquor Commission
 
03:41:36.950 --> 03:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
um investigate or just go into you know
 
03:41:39.590 --> 03:41:39.600 align:start position:0%
Social Clubs like they do you know
 
03:41:43.250 --> 03:41:43.260 align:start position:0%
restaurants or bars thank you for that
 
03:41:45.110 --> 03:41:45.120 align:start position:0%
question representative and yes we do
 
03:41:47.570 --> 03:41:47.580 align:start position:0%
the the premise inspections by our
 
03:41:50.150 --> 03:41:50.160 align:start position:0%
investigators are conducted on all New
 
03:41:53.870 --> 03:41:53.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire licensees so thanks yes thank
 
03:41:53.880 --> 03:41:55.130 align:start position:0%
Hampshire licensees so thanks yes thank
you

03:41:55.130 --> 03:41:55.140 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:41:59.929 --> 03:41:59.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:03.769 --> 03:42:03.779 align:start position:0%
this is a request for clarification
 
03:42:07.790 --> 03:42:07.800 align:start position:0%
um looking at the specificity of the
 
03:42:09.410 --> 03:42:09.420 align:start position:0%
language as I understand it the language
 
03:42:11.870 --> 03:42:11.880 align:start position:0%
of the existing statute particularly in
 
03:42:14.389 --> 03:42:14.399 align:start position:0%
regard to the operation of restaurants
 
03:42:17.090 --> 03:42:17.100 align:start position:0%
and cocktail lounges
 
03:42:19.849 --> 03:42:19.859 align:start position:0%
um my question is why is this level of
 
03:42:23.990 --> 03:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
specificity in the statute at all why
 
03:42:26.269 --> 03:42:26.279 align:start position:0%
isn't this left to administrative
 
03:42:26.279 --> 03:42:29.210 align:start position:0%
isn't this left to administrative
regulation

03:42:29.210 --> 03:42:29.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:32.269 --> 03:42:32.279 align:start position:0%
thank you representative in in which
 
03:42:33.950 --> 03:42:33.960 align:start position:0%
statute were you referring to on that
 
03:42:38.150 --> 03:42:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:38.160 --> 03:42:39.769 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

03:42:39.769 --> 03:42:39.779 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:42:42.830 --> 03:42:42.840 align:start position:0%
so I can actually answer this question
 
03:42:42.840 --> 03:42:44.030 align:start position:0%
so I can actually answer this question
um

03:42:44.030 --> 03:42:44.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:42:48.590 --> 03:42:48.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:52.130 --> 03:42:52.140 align:start position:0%
we only have restaurants
 
03:42:55.130 --> 03:42:55.140 align:start position:0%
and that a restaurant as long as it's
 
03:42:56.929 --> 03:42:56.939 align:start position:0%
serving food
 
03:42:59.809 --> 03:42:59.819 align:start position:0%
actually has a cheaper license
 
03:43:02.690 --> 03:43:02.700 align:start position:0%
than if they um
 
03:43:06.229 --> 03:43:06.239 align:start position:0%
want to close the restaurant
 
03:43:08.750 --> 03:43:08.760 align:start position:0%
and the rest and that that moment of
 
03:43:10.490 --> 03:43:10.500 align:start position:0%
closing which is usually nine o'clock I
 
03:43:13.309 --> 03:43:13.319 align:start position:0%
think is when the magic hour and then
 
03:43:15.889 --> 03:43:15.899 align:start position:0%
they have a a space that they're going
 
03:43:18.769 --> 03:43:18.779 align:start position:0%
to call the cocktail lounge
 
03:43:21.110 --> 03:43:21.120 align:start position:0%
and so yes there is a this very
 
03:43:24.050 --> 03:43:24.060 align:start position:0%
distinctive statute you can see in terms
 
03:43:25.729 --> 03:43:25.739 align:start position:0%
of the operating three hours I've been
 
03:43:29.090 --> 03:43:29.100 align:start position:0%
open this is all because we're now
 
03:43:33.530 --> 03:43:33.540 align:start position:0%
articulating what makes it permissible
 
03:43:37.550 --> 03:43:37.560 align:start position:0%
for that restaurant to stay open
 
03:43:41.269 --> 03:43:41.279 align:start position:0%
without the restaurant staying open
 
03:43:44.030 --> 03:43:44.040 align:start position:0%
because otherwise because now for all
 
03:43:45.950 --> 03:43:45.960 align:start position:0%
intents and purposes it's a bar so
 
03:43:48.170 --> 03:43:48.180 align:start position:0%
that's why we have this long statute and
 
03:43:49.729 --> 03:43:49.739 align:start position:0%
the only reason I know all about this
 
03:43:54.769 --> 03:43:54.779 align:start position:0%
was way back when when I did the um I
 
03:43:56.750 --> 03:43:56.760 align:start position:0%
was chair of the subcommittee for the
 
03:43:58.070 --> 03:43:58.080 align:start position:0%
smoking Act
 
03:44:00.229 --> 03:44:00.239 align:start position:0%
and the indoor smoking act we were
 
03:44:02.150 --> 03:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
basically changing the law in New
 
03:44:04.429 --> 03:44:04.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire from where you can just look
 
03:44:07.490 --> 03:44:07.500 align:start position:0%
for non-smoking signs to now you only
 
03:44:09.830 --> 03:44:09.840 align:start position:0%
can go where there are designated
 
03:44:11.389 --> 03:44:11.399 align:start position:0%
smoking areas
 
03:44:14.570 --> 03:44:14.580 align:start position:0%
and the hot spot was what we're going to
 
03:44:16.070 --> 03:44:16.080 align:start position:0%
do about restaurants
 
03:44:18.530 --> 03:44:18.540 align:start position:0%
and so we specifically I we came to this
 
03:44:20.570 --> 03:44:20.580 align:start position:0%
found in a statute and I never really
 
03:44:22.250 --> 03:44:22.260 align:start position:0%
this is long before I ever did any
 
03:44:25.190 --> 03:44:25.200 align:start position:0%
liquor laws legislation where we came in
 
03:44:27.229 --> 03:44:27.239 align:start position:0%
with the restaurant hospital by the way
 
03:44:30.950 --> 03:44:30.960 align:start position:0%
there's this definition of a cocktail
 
03:44:34.190 --> 03:44:34.200 align:start position:0%
lounge and that was Bingo that was where
 
03:44:38.150 --> 03:44:38.160 align:start position:0%
we were going to allow smoking up until
 
03:44:39.650 --> 03:44:39.660 align:start position:0%
um about 10 years later and that got
 
03:44:39.660 --> 03:44:40.910 align:start position:0%
um about 10 years later and that got
repealed

03:44:40.910 --> 03:44:40.920 align:start position:0%
repealed
 
03:44:43.130 --> 03:44:43.140 align:start position:0%
in terms of smoking in a cocktail lounge
 
03:44:45.530 --> 03:44:45.540 align:start position:0%
so that's why
 
03:44:47.570 --> 03:44:47.580 align:start position:0%
accept of your well social clubs are
 
03:44:50.269 --> 03:44:50.279 align:start position:0%
different but so that's why this is so
 
03:44:52.849 --> 03:44:52.859 align:start position:0%
particular in detail was to really
 
03:44:56.750 --> 03:44:56.760 align:start position:0%
articulate what is that space that
 
03:44:59.450 --> 03:44:59.460 align:start position:0%
um is is is is for all sense of purpose
 
03:45:01.969 --> 03:45:01.979 align:start position:0%
it's a bar but it's a bar inside a
 
03:45:01.979 --> 03:45:03.290 align:start position:0%
it's a bar but it's a bar inside a
restaurant

03:45:03.290 --> 03:45:03.300 align:start position:0%
restaurant
 
03:45:11.389 --> 03:45:11.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:12.889 --> 03:45:12.899 align:start position:0%
yeah I guess I still have the question
 
03:45:15.469 --> 03:45:15.479 align:start position:0%
this is uh subcommittee no you go ahead
 
03:45:16.910 --> 03:45:16.920 align:start position:0%
go with your question
 
03:45:18.229 --> 03:45:18.239 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:45:22.190 --> 03:45:22.200 align:start position:0%
um why isn't that level of detail left
 
03:45:24.590 --> 03:45:24.600 align:start position:0%
to administrative regulation by rules I
 
03:45:27.410 --> 03:45:27.420 align:start position:0%
was in left to rules I sorry that's what
 
03:45:29.150 --> 03:45:29.160 align:start position:0%
we call it rules yeah why wasn't it left
 
03:45:32.330 --> 03:45:32.340 align:start position:0%
to rules yes yeah so um
 
03:45:34.610 --> 03:45:34.620 align:start position:0%
you know I used to have a running joke I
 
03:45:36.650 --> 03:45:36.660 align:start position:0%
said you know what I think all rules
 
03:45:39.170 --> 03:45:39.180 align:start position:0%
should expire and we should then bring
 
03:45:41.090 --> 03:45:41.100 align:start position:0%
them in and put them in the rsas so
 
03:45:42.590 --> 03:45:42.600 align:start position:0%
people didn't have to go look at two
 
03:45:44.389 --> 03:45:44.399 align:start position:0%
different places for all the laws of the
 
03:45:44.399 --> 03:45:45.229 align:start position:0%
different places for all the laws of the
land

03:45:45.229 --> 03:45:45.239 align:start position:0%
land
 
03:45:48.170 --> 03:45:48.180 align:start position:0%
but what happens is is that the
 
03:45:50.929 --> 03:45:50.939 align:start position:0%
legislature in its wisdom can create a
 
03:45:52.729 --> 03:45:52.739 align:start position:0%
concept and create something
 
03:45:55.490 --> 03:45:55.500 align:start position:0%
but that if we were to spend the time to
 
03:45:57.469 --> 03:45:57.479 align:start position:0%
go through and there's a lot of words
 
03:45:57.479 --> 03:45:58.309 align:start position:0%
go through and there's a lot of words
here

03:45:58.309 --> 03:45:58.319 align:start position:0%
here
 
03:46:00.410 --> 03:46:00.420 align:start position:0%
so we were to go to through this and
 
03:46:03.290 --> 03:46:03.300 align:start position:0%
create this all these words you would
 
03:46:05.809 --> 03:46:05.819 align:start position:0%
say oh my God you know it'll take
 
03:46:07.309 --> 03:46:07.319 align:start position:0%
forever it would take for it to pass
 
03:46:09.349 --> 03:46:09.359 align:start position:0%
well it probably did take a long time
 
03:46:11.830 --> 03:46:11.840 align:start position:0%
for this section to pass
 
03:46:11.840 --> 03:46:13.550 align:start position:0%
for this section to pass
rules

03:46:13.550 --> 03:46:13.560 align:start position:0%
rules
 
03:46:16.429 --> 03:46:16.439 align:start position:0%
um for some committees rules are great
 
03:46:18.410 --> 03:46:18.420 align:start position:0%
let's just do everything by rules
 
03:46:21.290 --> 03:46:21.300 align:start position:0%
and other committees know we we want to
 
03:46:23.630 --> 03:46:23.640 align:start position:0%
have a lot of Statute have a lot of
 
03:46:23.640 --> 03:46:24.769 align:start position:0%
have a lot of Statute have a lot of
Statute

03:46:24.769 --> 03:46:24.779 align:start position:0%
Statute
 
03:46:26.530 --> 03:46:26.540 align:start position:0%
um I grant you this is a very long
 
03:46:30.650 --> 03:46:30.660 align:start position:0%
rulemaking section but it was compelled
 
03:46:33.889 --> 03:46:33.899 align:start position:0%
that uh to make this clear they I I
 
03:46:35.630 --> 03:46:35.640 align:start position:0%
would say this didn't pass in the year
 
03:46:38.210 --> 03:46:38.220 align:start position:0%
it took a while for them to get all
 
03:46:40.910 --> 03:46:40.920 align:start position:0%
these words together and
 
03:46:44.269 --> 03:46:44.279 align:start position:0%
um it is for both people who are who
 
03:46:46.190 --> 03:46:46.200 align:start position:0%
have to read the laws that if I were a
 
03:46:49.250 --> 03:46:49.260 align:start position:0%
liquor licensee it'd be nice to see
 
03:46:51.650 --> 03:46:51.660 align:start position:0%
things in the statute rather than having
 
03:46:54.229 --> 03:46:54.239 align:start position:0%
to go look at rules that's all no
 
03:46:56.210 --> 03:46:56.220 align:start position:0%
particular reason thank you
 
03:46:56.220 --> 03:46:57.830 align:start position:0%
particular reason thank you
okay

03:46:57.830 --> 03:46:57.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:46:59.929 --> 03:46:59.939 align:start position:0%
yes representative field
 
03:47:02.210 --> 03:47:02.220 align:start position:0%
two questions related to the section
 
03:47:04.729 --> 03:47:04.739 align:start position:0%
about uh persons in charge of the
 
03:47:07.670 --> 03:47:07.680 align:start position:0%
premises okay the first is that uh We've
 
03:47:09.229 --> 03:47:09.239 align:start position:0%
struck the language related to an
 
03:47:11.389 --> 03:47:11.399 align:start position:0%
affidavit for the person in charge that
 
03:47:13.190 --> 03:47:13.200 align:start position:0%
they're over 18 and not convicted of a
 
03:47:13.200 --> 03:47:14.090 align:start position:0%
they're over 18 and not convicted of a
felony

03:47:14.090 --> 03:47:14.100 align:start position:0%
felony
 
03:47:15.530 --> 03:47:15.540 align:start position:0%
but then at the end of the paragraph
 
03:47:17.389 --> 03:47:17.399 align:start position:0%
there's added language that licenses
 
03:47:18.710 --> 03:47:18.720 align:start position:0%
shall maintain a record of all
 
03:47:21.590 --> 03:47:21.600 align:start position:0%
affidavits for persons in charge
 
03:47:23.330 --> 03:47:23.340 align:start position:0%
so we created a contradiction there that
 
03:47:25.070 --> 03:47:25.080 align:start position:0%
we no longer require an affidavit but
 
03:47:27.849 --> 03:47:27.859 align:start position:0%
we're requiring an affidavit
 
03:47:30.349 --> 03:47:30.359 align:start position:0%
thank you representative so there's
 
03:47:32.630 --> 03:47:32.640 align:start position:0%
really essentially two
 
03:47:32.640 --> 03:47:33.410 align:start position:0%
really essentially two
um

03:47:33.410 --> 03:47:33.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:47:35.690 --> 03:47:35.700 align:start position:0%
different scenarios where affidavits
 
03:47:38.690 --> 03:47:38.700 align:start position:0%
were presented one was for persons in
 
03:47:41.330 --> 03:47:41.340 align:start position:0%
charge and one was for ownership so the
 
03:47:43.969 --> 03:47:43.979 align:start position:0%
ownership and felon exception waiver
 
03:47:47.150 --> 03:47:47.160 align:start position:0%
process still exists in statute so we do
 
03:47:49.250 --> 03:47:49.260 align:start position:0%
need that affidavit still
 
03:47:50.809 --> 03:47:50.819 align:start position:0%
and that's what this affidavit is
 
03:47:54.469 --> 03:47:54.479 align:start position:0%
referring to which uh is is why I
 
03:47:56.150 --> 03:47:56.160 align:start position:0%
explained an administrative rule that's
 
03:47:58.250 --> 03:47:58.260 align:start position:0%
where that's going to be cleaned up so
 
03:48:01.490 --> 03:48:01.500 align:start position:0%
we intend on having a form to designate
 
03:48:03.889 --> 03:48:03.899 align:start position:0%
the person in charge and the affidavit
 
03:48:06.469 --> 03:48:06.479 align:start position:0%
will apply to the ownership for which
 
03:48:10.969 --> 03:48:10.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:14.690 --> 03:48:14.700 align:start position:0%
uh and as a clear part of the statute
 
03:48:16.370 --> 03:48:16.380 align:start position:0%
are they the earlier part of the statute
 
03:48:19.070 --> 03:48:19.080 align:start position:0%
uh we're on page one on line six through
 
03:48:21.710 --> 03:48:21.720 align:start position:0%
13. we're on right now you're looking at
 
03:48:25.849 --> 03:48:25.859 align:start position:0%
uh paragraph uh four paragraphs so we're
 
03:48:28.729 --> 03:48:28.739 align:start position:0%
looking at now
 
03:48:30.530 --> 03:48:30.540 align:start position:0%
so looking at the struck language in
 
03:48:32.570 --> 03:48:32.580 align:start position:0%
lines six through eight as compared to
 
03:48:40.030 --> 03:48:40.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:44.570 --> 03:48:44.580 align:start position:0%
correct if I could clarify we are
 
03:48:47.210 --> 03:48:47.220 align:start position:0%
um getting rid of the language that says
 
03:48:49.610 --> 03:48:49.620 align:start position:0%
the person in charge has to have it at
 
03:48:52.070 --> 03:48:52.080 align:start position:0%
the affidavit on file that attests to
 
03:48:54.050 --> 03:48:54.060 align:start position:0%
their felony conviction
 
03:48:56.030 --> 03:48:56.040 align:start position:0%
the request there's still a requirement
 
03:48:58.250 --> 03:48:58.260 align:start position:0%
for them to designate a person in charge
 
03:49:01.010 --> 03:49:01.020 align:start position:0%
but this language is specific to the
 
03:49:03.769 --> 03:49:03.779 align:start position:0%
person in charge affidavit attesting to
 
03:49:06.650 --> 03:49:06.660 align:start position:0%
their their criminal background that is
 
03:49:08.630 --> 03:49:08.640 align:start position:0%
no longer needed because a waiver is no
 
03:49:11.469 --> 03:49:11.479 align:start position:0%
longer applied for that so that language
 
03:49:14.269 --> 03:49:14.279 align:start position:0%
removes the requirement of the affidavit
 
03:49:16.309 --> 03:49:16.319 align:start position:0%
to speak about their their criminal
 
03:49:18.290 --> 03:49:18.300 align:start position:0%
background it keeps the language in
 
03:49:19.969 --> 03:49:19.979 align:start position:0%
there that um if you look a little
 
03:49:21.410 --> 03:49:21.420 align:start position:0%
further that for the purposes of this
 
03:49:23.750 --> 03:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
section any corporate officer member of
 
03:49:25.309 --> 03:49:25.319 align:start position:0%
liability companies shall be deemed a
 
03:49:26.929 --> 03:49:26.939 align:start position:0%
person in charge of the license premise
 
03:49:29.690 --> 03:49:29.700 align:start position:0%
those corporate officers those members
 
03:49:31.670 --> 03:49:31.680 align:start position:0%
of the limited liability companies are
 
03:49:33.590 --> 03:49:33.600 align:start position:0%
persons in charge they're automatically
 
03:49:36.349 --> 03:49:36.359 align:start position:0%
persons in charge they have other
 
03:49:38.450 --> 03:49:38.460 align:start position:0%
requirements regarding their criminal
 
03:49:40.610 --> 03:49:40.620 align:start position:0%
status so they have to apply an
 
03:49:42.650 --> 03:49:42.660 align:start position:0%
affidavit so that is the affidavit that
 
03:49:44.630 --> 03:49:44.640 align:start position:0%
they're speaking to here we're just
 
03:49:46.849 --> 03:49:46.859 align:start position:0%
striking the language that says the
 
03:49:48.830 --> 03:49:48.840 align:start position:0%
person in charge has to have affidavit
 
03:49:51.050 --> 03:49:51.060 align:start position:0%
on file attesting to their criminal
 
03:49:53.630 --> 03:49:53.640 align:start position:0%
history wouldn't it be better to say
 
03:49:57.590 --> 03:49:57.600 align:start position:0%
records of all affidavits including
 
03:50:01.309 --> 03:50:01.319 align:start position:0%
a felony conviction in other words
 
03:50:03.469 --> 03:50:03.479 align:start position:0%
because it just says all affidavits it's
 
03:50:05.090 --> 03:50:05.100 align:start position:0%
sort of they all affidavits are kind of
 
03:50:06.410 --> 03:50:06.420 align:start position:0%
hanging out there
 
03:50:09.410 --> 03:50:09.420 align:start position:0%
shouldn't you have some saying or you
 
03:50:10.849 --> 03:50:10.859 align:start position:0%
know the records of all affidaves
 
03:50:12.410 --> 03:50:12.420 align:start position:0%
including which is what the paragraph
 
03:50:19.910 --> 03:50:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:22.790 --> 03:50:22.800 align:start position:0%
and thank you chairman and I can see the
 
03:50:25.610 --> 03:50:25.620 align:start position:0%
confusion that that may cause if you
 
03:50:27.530 --> 03:50:27.540 align:start position:0%
would like we can work on language for
 
03:50:29.510 --> 03:50:29.520 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee on that I think I was a
 
03:50:33.830 --> 03:50:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:35.870 --> 03:50:35.880 align:start position:0%
just to clarify because I you know all
 
03:50:37.610 --> 03:50:37.620 align:start position:0%
affidavits how many other affidavits are
 
03:50:37.620 --> 03:50:39.849 align:start position:0%
affidavits how many other affidavits are
there

03:50:39.849 --> 03:50:39.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:42.110 --> 03:50:42.120 align:start position:0%
right we have a lot of paperwork it's
 
03:50:43.429 --> 03:50:43.439 align:start position:0%
not about all of them it's about
 
03:50:45.889 --> 03:50:45.899 align:start position:0%
affidavits related to felony correct
 
03:50:47.750 --> 03:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
right not the word all so I would be
 
03:50:49.309 --> 03:50:49.319 align:start position:0%
scratching the word all and that the
 
03:50:54.710 --> 03:50:54.720 align:start position:0%
records of of any affidavits for
 
03:50:54.720 --> 03:50:56.510 align:start position:0%
records of of any affidavits for
felonies

03:50:56.510 --> 03:50:56.520 align:start position:0%
felonies
 
03:51:00.110 --> 03:51:00.120 align:start position:0%
perfect we'll work on that thank you
 
03:51:01.670 --> 03:51:01.680 align:start position:0%
and then one other question related to
 
03:51:03.349 --> 03:51:03.359 align:start position:0%
the section uh you've struck the
 
03:51:04.910 --> 03:51:04.920 align:start position:0%
language related to a person in charge
 
03:51:07.910 --> 03:51:07.920 align:start position:0%
uh and a felony conviction but also in
 
03:51:10.250 --> 03:51:10.260 align:start position:0%
that same area that struck uh struck the
 
03:51:11.750 --> 03:51:11.760 align:start position:0%
requirement they'd be 18 years of age
 
03:51:13.370 --> 03:51:13.380 align:start position:0%
and older well I'd imagine there's
 
03:51:15.050 --> 03:51:15.060 align:start position:0%
elsewhere in the stature that requires
 
03:51:18.650 --> 03:51:18.660 align:start position:0%
that the person uh not be a minor uh it
 
03:51:20.090 --> 03:51:20.100 align:start position:0%
may seem a little awkward here to have
 
03:51:21.830 --> 03:51:21.840 align:start position:0%
struck that specifically in this section
 
03:51:24.290 --> 03:51:24.300 align:start position:0%
would it be desirable to still say that
 
03:51:25.910 --> 03:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
a person in charge needs to be 18 years
 
03:51:28.910 --> 03:51:28.920 align:start position:0%
of age or older and then also still
 
03:51:30.229 --> 03:51:30.239 align:start position:0%
allow that person to be a corporate
 
03:51:30.239 --> 03:51:38.510 align:start position:0%
allow that person to be a corporate
officer

03:51:38.510 --> 03:51:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:40.610 --> 03:51:40.620 align:start position:0%
thank you representative I believe that
 
03:51:43.190 --> 03:51:43.200 align:start position:0%
is covered in RSA 1783 and we'll we're
 
03:51:45.590 --> 03:51:45.600 align:start position:0%
checking on that now
 
03:51:47.990 --> 03:51:48.000 align:start position:0%
um but yes during the application
 
03:51:50.150 --> 03:51:50.160 align:start position:0%
process that's where on all of our
 
03:51:52.130 --> 03:51:52.140 align:start position:0%
applications which are governed by rule
 
03:51:53.929 --> 03:51:53.939 align:start position:0%
those questions are asked on those
 
03:51:55.910 --> 03:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
documents as well right I'm just saying
 
03:51:57.590 --> 03:51:57.600 align:start position:0%
that perhaps for consistency sake we
 
03:51:59.150 --> 03:51:59.160 align:start position:0%
should leave the the language here that
 
03:52:00.769 --> 03:52:00.779 align:start position:0%
the person is required to be 18 years of
 
03:52:02.809 --> 03:52:02.819 align:start position:0%
age or older particularly for creating
 
03:52:04.250 --> 03:52:04.260 align:start position:0%
legislative history if we strike it here
 
03:52:05.450 --> 03:52:05.460 align:start position:0%
but leave it elsewhere it creates an
 
03:52:05.460 --> 03:52:13.550 align:start position:0%
but leave it elsewhere it creates an
ambiguity

03:52:13.550 --> 03:52:13.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:16.729 --> 03:52:16.739 align:start position:0%
yeah sometimes redundancy is okay
 
03:52:18.349 --> 03:52:18.359 align:start position:0%
if if
 
03:52:20.389 --> 03:52:20.399 align:start position:0%
it's a different thought I mean one
 
03:52:22.370 --> 03:52:22.380 align:start position:0%
thought is you know that's that's the
 
03:52:22.380 --> 03:52:23.750 align:start position:0%
thought is you know that's that's the
ownership

03:52:23.750 --> 03:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
ownership
 
03:52:25.550 --> 03:52:25.560 align:start position:0%
but if this is about
 
03:52:46.670 --> 03:52:46.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:50.090 --> 03:52:50.100 align:start position:0%
correct if that were to remain then we
 
03:52:53.510 --> 03:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
would have to still file an Affidavit of
 
03:52:55.969 --> 03:52:55.979 align:start position:0%
testing that there are 18 years of age
 
03:52:57.889 --> 03:52:57.899 align:start position:0%
correct which would be a very simple
 
03:52:59.990 --> 03:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
affidavit but it's probably an important
 
03:53:04.550 --> 03:53:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:06.769 --> 03:53:06.779 align:start position:0%
didn't file
 
03:53:08.630 --> 03:53:08.640 align:start position:0%
and presumably you don't want a minor
 
03:53:13.070 --> 03:53:13.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:14.929 --> 03:53:14.939 align:start position:0%
if you would like I can certainly uh
 
03:53:18.469 --> 03:53:18.479 align:start position:0%
research that for the subcommittee in in
 
03:53:18.479 --> 03:53:20.210 align:start position:0%
research that for the subcommittee in in
um

03:53:20.210 --> 03:53:20.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:53:21.830 --> 03:53:21.840 align:start position:0%
if needed we'll add that to the
 
03:53:24.830 --> 03:53:24.840 align:start position:0%
amendment yeah just
 
03:53:27.170 --> 03:53:27.180 align:start position:0%
I I mean almost
 
03:53:29.090 --> 03:53:29.100 align:start position:0%
change what is the purpose of this
 
03:53:30.410 --> 03:53:30.420 align:start position:0%
paragraph is this purpose of this
 
03:53:33.170 --> 03:53:33.180 align:start position:0%
paragraph originally maybe was the
 
03:53:36.769 --> 03:53:36.779 align:start position:0%
felony issue okay but now since the
 
03:53:38.510 --> 03:53:38.520 align:start position:0%
family's been taken out so now the
 
03:53:42.650 --> 03:53:42.660 align:start position:0%
purpose of this paragraph is affidavit
 
03:53:46.210 --> 03:53:46.220 align:start position:0%
that that the person in charge
 
03:53:49.010 --> 03:53:49.020 align:start position:0%
exactly we were trying
 
03:53:51.950 --> 03:53:51.960 align:start position:0%
to limit the number of affidavits and
 
03:53:54.170 --> 03:53:54.180 align:start position:0%
think of it in this context we have 62
 
03:53:58.309 --> 03:53:58.319 align:start position:0%
60 to 6400 licensees in the state all of
 
03:53:58.319 --> 03:53:59.690 align:start position:0%
60 to 6400 licensees in the state all of
whom

03:53:59.690 --> 03:53:59.700 align:start position:0%
whom
 
03:54:02.870 --> 03:54:02.880 align:start position:0%
um are sending in multiple affidavits
 
03:54:06.290 --> 03:54:06.300 align:start position:0%
per business so that's literally tens of
 
03:54:07.910 --> 03:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
thousands of documents that are being
 
03:54:10.849 --> 03:54:10.859 align:start position:0%
retained and since the felony exception
 
03:54:13.610 --> 03:54:13.620 align:start position:0%
for the persons in charge has been
 
03:54:13.620 --> 03:54:15.590 align:start position:0%
for the persons in charge has been
repealed

03:54:15.590 --> 03:54:15.600 align:start position:0%
repealed
 
03:54:17.450 --> 03:54:17.460 align:start position:0%
the thought was that there was no reason
 
03:54:19.550 --> 03:54:19.560 align:start position:0%
to submit that affidavit anymore and
 
03:54:23.570 --> 03:54:23.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:23.580 --> 03:54:24.590 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:54:24.590 --> 03:54:24.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:54:27.110 --> 03:54:27.120 align:start position:0%
uh the I think the part that we're
 
03:54:29.510 --> 03:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
missing here is this is a
 
03:54:31.790 --> 03:54:31.800 align:start position:0%
um edit to paragraph one
 
03:54:35.269 --> 03:54:35.279 align:start position:0%
further on in that statute section two
 
03:54:37.010 --> 03:54:37.020 align:start position:0%
says a person at least 18 year years of
 
03:54:38.330 --> 03:54:38.340 align:start position:0%
age shall be in attendance and be
 
03:54:39.889 --> 03:54:39.899 align:start position:0%
designated a person in charge of the
 
03:54:42.170 --> 03:54:42.180 align:start position:0%
employees and the business and then in
 
03:54:44.210 --> 03:54:44.220 align:start position:0%
paragraph three it says the provisions
 
03:54:45.889 --> 03:54:45.899 align:start position:0%
of this section shall in no way prohibit
 
03:54:47.630 --> 03:54:47.640 align:start position:0%
an on-premise or off-premise licensee
 
03:54:49.969 --> 03:54:49.979 align:start position:0%
from employing person's 18 year age or
 
03:54:51.769 --> 03:54:51.779 align:start position:0%
older to sell server otherwise handle or
 
03:54:53.750 --> 03:54:53.760 align:start position:0%
be left in charge of the business so
 
03:54:55.550 --> 03:54:55.560 align:start position:0%
it's it's actually in the statute
 
03:54:57.290 --> 03:54:57.300 align:start position:0%
further down twice
 
03:54:59.630 --> 03:54:59.640 align:start position:0%
so what I want you to do is rewrite this
 
03:55:01.910 --> 03:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
paragraph and turn it upside down
 
03:55:04.250 --> 03:55:04.260 align:start position:0%
and bait this paragraph is about when do
 
03:55:08.630 --> 03:55:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:10.790 --> 03:55:10.800 align:start position:0%
we can definitely and that they must be
 
03:55:14.809 --> 03:55:14.819 align:start position:0%
maintained and it must be maintained
 
03:55:16.309 --> 03:55:16.319 align:start position:0%
perfect thank you
 
03:55:20.450 --> 03:55:20.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:22.010 --> 03:55:22.020 align:start position:0%
representative filo does that make sense
 
03:55:22.969 --> 03:55:22.979 align:start position:0%
to you
 
03:55:24.950 --> 03:55:24.960 align:start position:0%
I think that makes it that really what
 
03:55:26.689 --> 03:55:26.699 align:start position:0%
you're trying to do is specify when and
 
03:55:29.689 --> 03:55:29.699 align:start position:0%
affidavit is needed to uh eliminate the
 
03:55:30.889 --> 03:55:30.899 align:start position:0%
burden on your behalf of how much
 
03:55:32.269 --> 03:55:32.279 align:start position:0%
paperwork you're getting so really
 
03:55:33.229 --> 03:55:33.239 align:start position:0%
you're actually creating more of an
 
03:55:35.030 --> 03:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
exception to win an affidavit is needed
 
03:55:37.130 --> 03:55:37.140 align:start position:0%
or not dated correct correct that's
 
03:55:38.689 --> 03:55:38.699 align:start position:0%
correct so yeah I think it makes sense
 
03:55:40.550 --> 03:55:40.560 align:start position:0%
to flip it over and say when when do you
 
03:55:41.510 --> 03:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
not want to be bothered with the
 
03:55:41.520 --> 03:55:43.370 align:start position:0%
not want to be bothered with the
paperwork

03:55:43.370 --> 03:55:43.380 align:start position:0%
paperwork
 
03:55:46.849 --> 03:55:46.859 align:start position:0%
okay perfect thank you all right
 
03:55:51.290 --> 03:55:51.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:56.510 --> 03:55:56.520 align:start position:0%
all right any other questions uh for 407
 
03:55:58.969 --> 03:55:58.979 align:start position:0%
so much for housekeeping thank you thank
 
03:56:06.969 --> 03:56:06.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:09.710 --> 03:56:09.720 align:start position:0%
that's it right
 
03:56:09.720 --> 03:56:13.250 align:start position:0%
that's it right
okay

03:56:13.250 --> 03:56:13.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:18.590 --> 03:56:18.600 align:start position:0%
okay so close of 407 okay so 304 the uh
 
03:56:20.870 --> 03:56:20.880 align:start position:0%
sponsor which actually had a bill after
 
03:56:22.370 --> 03:56:22.380 align:start position:0%
that and he told me he won and released
 
03:56:24.290 --> 03:56:24.300 align:start position:0%
but he didn't realize that 304 was there
 
03:56:26.030 --> 03:56:26.040 align:start position:0%
also so
 
03:56:28.130 --> 03:56:28.140 align:start position:0%
um we are going to open the hearing in
 
03:56:30.530 --> 03:56:30.540 align:start position:0%
304 and close the hearing because I know
 
03:56:32.330 --> 03:56:32.340 align:start position:0%
there are a couple of people here here
 
03:56:36.710 --> 03:56:36.720 align:start position:0%
for 304 and we will reschedule uh 304
 
03:56:41.150 --> 03:56:41.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:52.030 --> 03:56:52.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:55.910 --> 03:56:55.920 align:start position:0%
yeah and I'm sure we all have used
 
03:57:00.530 --> 03:57:00.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:00.540 --> 03:57:02.450 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:57:02.450 --> 03:57:02.460 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:57:06.290 --> 03:57:06.300 align:start position:0%
and so I will recess this Harry
 
03:57:10.389 --> 03:57:10.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:13.610 --> 03:57:13.620 align:start position:0%
okay so we are we have a very busy day
 
03:57:13.620 --> 03:57:16.010 align:start position:0%
okay so we are we have a very busy day
tomorrow

03:57:16.010 --> 03:57:16.020 align:start position:0%
tomorrow
 
03:57:16.020 --> 03:57:18.349 align:start position:0%
tomorrow
and

03:57:18.349 --> 03:57:18.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:57:22.429 --> 03:57:22.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:26.630 --> 03:57:26.640 align:start position:0%
the 215 got canceled and um
 
03:57:29.090 --> 03:57:29.100 align:start position:0%
and then because these last two were
 
03:57:31.610 --> 03:57:31.620 align:start position:0%
representative Magoo's bills and
 
03:57:34.370 --> 03:57:34.380 align:start position:0%
evidently he's in Toronto
 
03:57:36.590 --> 03:57:36.600 align:start position:0%
um all right so uh just so you have a
 
03:57:39.170 --> 03:57:39.180 align:start position:0%
picture for next week next week
 
03:57:41.210 --> 03:57:41.220 align:start position:0%
um obviously Tuesday is a session day
 
03:57:43.610 --> 03:57:43.620 align:start position:0%
where we're gonna hear from the governor
 
03:57:45.889 --> 03:57:45.899 align:start position:0%
and the governor's budget
 
03:57:48.110 --> 03:57:48.120 align:start position:0%
um and then it's a session so let's see
 
03:57:50.809 --> 03:57:50.819 align:start position:0%
what bills get uh attended to
 
03:57:53.030 --> 03:57:53.040 align:start position:0%
um if you guys all get your blurbs in to
 
03:57:55.309 --> 03:57:55.319 align:start position:0%
me who else am I missing I guess I
 
03:57:58.030 --> 03:57:58.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:01.849 --> 03:58:01.859 align:start position:0%

so then we'll have some of things on the
 
03:58:04.969 --> 03:58:04.979 align:start position:0%

04:18:42.910 --> 04:18:42.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:18:46.610 --> 04:18:46.620 align:start position:0%
the opening of the conversation here and
 
04:18:48.530 --> 04:18:48.540 align:start position:0%
that is evidently there was a fair
 
04:18:51.950 --> 04:18:51.960 align:start position:0%
amount of mailings that went out to
 
04:18:54.889 --> 04:18:54.899 align:start position:0%
uh well I don't know I don't I don't
 
04:18:56.630 --> 04:18:56.640 align:start position:0%
remember seeing all these but I guess I
 
04:19:00.290 --> 04:19:00.300 align:start position:0%
wasn't paying attention enough but uh uh
 
04:19:02.570 --> 04:19:02.580 align:start position:0%
of people who were upset that that
 
04:19:06.170 --> 04:19:06.180 align:start position:0%
things were taken out of uh in my
 
04:19:08.210 --> 04:19:08.220 align:start position:0%
Amendment they were taken out of
 
04:19:11.689 --> 04:19:11.699 align:start position:0%
6 30 the original bill that they would
 
04:19:13.490 --> 04:19:13.500 align:start position:0%
like to see back in
 
04:19:16.130 --> 04:19:16.140 align:start position:0%
so one of the issues was the
 
04:19:16.140 --> 04:19:18.410 align:start position:0%
so one of the issues was the
self-cultivation

04:19:18.410 --> 04:19:18.420 align:start position:0%
self-cultivation
 
04:19:21.290 --> 04:19:21.300 align:start position:0%
all right self-cultivation is actually
 
04:19:24.889 --> 04:19:24.899 align:start position:0%
another bill that's in Criminal Justice
 
04:19:28.309 --> 04:19:28.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:30.469 --> 04:19:30.479 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
04:19:30.479 --> 04:19:32.349 align:start position:0%
okay so
um

04:19:32.349 --> 04:19:32.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:19:35.809 --> 04:19:35.819 align:start position:0%
uh so what else one of my next thing is
 
04:19:35.819 --> 04:19:38.870 align:start position:0%
uh so what else one of my next thing is
licensing

04:19:38.870 --> 04:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:38.880 --> 04:19:40.130 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:19:40.130 --> 04:19:40.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:19:42.469 --> 04:19:42.479 align:start position:0%
which may include so what so what are my
 
04:19:47.210 --> 04:19:47.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:48.830 --> 04:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
it's just a list of all the concerns
 
04:19:50.870 --> 04:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
with the amendment okay so let's I guess
 
04:19:53.450 --> 04:19:53.460 align:start position:0%
we'll go through this list here
 
04:19:56.450 --> 04:19:56.460 align:start position:0%
all right personal Liberty and annulment
 
04:19:59.210 --> 04:19:59.220 align:start position:0%
okay uh unlike the introduce the bill no
 
04:20:01.849 --> 04:20:01.859 align:start position:0%
it does not allow secure home called I'm
 
04:20:03.530 --> 04:20:03.540 align:start position:0%
explaining why I took home cultivation
 
04:20:05.269 --> 04:20:05.279 align:start position:0%
out you know it's going to be addressed
 
04:20:07.309 --> 04:20:07.319 align:start position:0%
in other bills so why why do we want to
 
04:20:08.990 --> 04:20:09.000 align:start position:0%
address it in this bill
 
04:20:11.150 --> 04:20:11.160 align:start position:0%
removes the robust enrollment and
 
04:20:13.010 --> 04:20:13.020 align:start position:0%
resentencing Provisions for past
 
04:20:15.590 --> 04:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
cannabis conviction again that's in
 
04:20:18.469 --> 04:20:18.479 align:start position:0%
that's in uh criminal justice
 
04:20:19.969 --> 04:20:19.979 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman
 
04:20:22.250 --> 04:20:22.260 align:start position:0%
yes Ms Jared over here yeah sorry uh
 
04:20:25.250 --> 04:20:25.260 align:start position:0%
yeah so just on just that logic not even
 
04:20:26.990 --> 04:20:27.000 align:start position:0%
necessarily this point but it was kind
 
04:20:28.849 --> 04:20:28.859 align:start position:0%
of I kind of equate that to the the Nano
 
04:20:30.889 --> 04:20:30.899 align:start position:0%
Brewery where we were thinking yeah it
 
04:20:32.030 --> 04:20:32.040 align:start position:0%
might be in another bill but what if
 
04:20:34.849 --> 04:20:34.859 align:start position:0%
that bill doesn't pass and so if it's a
 
04:20:36.110 --> 04:20:36.120 align:start position:0%
good piece
 
04:20:37.910 --> 04:20:37.920 align:start position:0%
shouldn't we pass it and then if there's
 
04:20:39.110 --> 04:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
another bill that passes something
 
04:20:40.550 --> 04:20:40.560 align:start position:0%
similar then we can kind of deal with
 
04:20:42.530 --> 04:20:42.540 align:start position:0%
them but we would would hate to exclude
 
04:20:44.389 --> 04:20:44.399 align:start position:0%
something that we do think is important
 
04:20:46.790 --> 04:20:46.800 align:start position:0%
because it's in another bill and then
 
04:20:48.349 --> 04:20:48.359 align:start position:0%
that other bill passes and it's now
 
04:20:52.370 --> 04:20:52.380 align:start position:0%
missing from okay so if you guys want to
 
04:20:56.510 --> 04:20:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:59.870 --> 04:20:59.880 align:start position:0%
into 639
 
04:21:02.750 --> 04:21:02.760 align:start position:0%
um I guess I just need to know you know
 
04:21:06.290 --> 04:21:06.300 align:start position:0%
if it basically if I take this all this
 
04:21:09.769 --> 04:21:09.779 align:start position:0%
list of stuff here and go find it in in
 
04:21:11.750 --> 04:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
the original 639
 
04:21:14.750 --> 04:21:14.760 align:start position:0%
and stick it on the amendment
 
04:21:16.910 --> 04:21:16.920 align:start position:0%
well I mean obviously do you but do you
 
04:21:18.469 --> 04:21:18.479 align:start position:0%
believe me when I say that we don't
 
04:21:20.630 --> 04:21:20.640 align:start position:0%
really want to muck up this bill with
 
04:21:22.130 --> 04:21:22.140 align:start position:0%
with home
 
04:21:31.070 --> 04:21:31.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:33.410 --> 04:21:33.420 align:start position:0%
we're hearing you just want to pass 639
 
04:21:43.790 --> 04:21:43.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:45.469 --> 04:21:45.479 align:start position:0%
well look you can we can go two ways
 
04:21:48.410 --> 04:21:48.420 align:start position:0%
with this one we can make a statement
 
04:21:51.229 --> 04:21:51.239 align:start position:0%
about what a large Coalition of people
 
04:21:53.870 --> 04:21:53.880 align:start position:0%
want and just watch it die
 
04:21:56.450 --> 04:21:56.460 align:start position:0%
or we can pass something that we think
 
04:21:59.110 --> 04:21:59.120 align:start position:0%
has a shot of being signed into law
 
04:22:02.210 --> 04:22:02.220 align:start position:0%
on this home Grove piece in particular I
 
04:22:05.210 --> 04:22:05.220 align:start position:0%
know that's a deal killer this bill will
 
04:22:07.010 --> 04:22:07.020 align:start position:0%
not be signed into law with home grow on
 
04:22:07.020 --> 04:22:08.330 align:start position:0%
not be signed into law with home grow on
it

04:22:08.330 --> 04:22:08.340 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:22:10.790 --> 04:22:10.800 align:start position:0%
um that's something I think we need to
 
04:22:13.550 --> 04:22:13.560 align:start position:0%
go after in the future okay kind of like
 
04:22:16.429 --> 04:22:16.439 align:start position:0%
uh on with hobby Brewing right you know
 
04:22:18.290 --> 04:22:18.300 align:start position:0%
we didn't have hobby Brewing back in the
 
04:22:20.510 --> 04:22:20.520 align:start position:0%
day but over the course of time we added
 
04:22:22.729 --> 04:22:22.739 align:start position:0%
it I think one day in the future after
 
04:22:25.070 --> 04:22:25.080 align:start position:0%
people see that you know the sky is not
 
04:22:26.990 --> 04:22:27.000 align:start position:0%
falling and you know people aren't
 
04:22:28.250 --> 04:22:28.260 align:start position:0%
running around
 
04:22:30.590 --> 04:22:30.600 align:start position:0%
creating Carnage on the streets as we
 
04:22:33.710 --> 04:22:33.720 align:start position:0%
heard in testimony that home grow is
 
04:22:35.870 --> 04:22:35.880 align:start position:0%
going to be a much more viable uh thing
 
04:22:42.050 --> 04:22:42.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:44.630 --> 04:22:44.640 align:start position:0%
yes and I'll say the same thing for the
 
04:22:47.650 --> 04:22:47.660 align:start position:0%
annulment piece as well
 
04:22:49.670 --> 04:22:49.680 align:start position:0%
that's that's another one that's not
 
04:22:58.790 --> 04:22:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:00.710 --> 04:23:00.720 align:start position:0%
I mean do we really think that is going
 
04:23:02.809 --> 04:23:02.819 align:start position:0%
to sign anything I mean didn't he say
 
04:23:04.370 --> 04:23:04.380 align:start position:0%
he's just basically against any
 
04:23:07.070 --> 04:23:07.080 align:start position:0%
marijuana bill am I wrong on that
 
04:23:10.429 --> 04:23:10.439 align:start position:0%
uh let me put it this way I I don't
 
04:23:11.809 --> 04:23:11.819 align:start position:0%
really spend a lot of time worrying
 
04:23:13.550 --> 04:23:13.560 align:start position:0%
about what the governor is going or not
 
04:23:17.510 --> 04:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
going to do right okay what I was uh
 
04:23:20.389 --> 04:23:20.399 align:start position:0%
trying to do was
 
04:23:20.399 --> 04:23:22.610 align:start position:0%
trying to do was
um

04:23:22.610 --> 04:23:22.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:26.689 --> 04:23:26.699 align:start position:0%
uh I I'm a big believer kiss
 
04:23:31.309 --> 04:23:31.319 align:start position:0%
and to do a piece of legislation that is
 
04:23:33.170 --> 04:23:33.180 align:start position:0%
um in in this case it's just as simple
 
04:23:36.050 --> 04:23:36.060 align:start position:0%
as I could how could I shrink it down so
 
04:23:39.050 --> 04:23:39.060 align:start position:0%
it's very straightforward and simple
 
04:23:41.630 --> 04:23:41.640 align:start position:0%
um that it even in in the way this bill
 
04:23:43.130 --> 04:23:43.140 align:start position:0%
you know what I did with the bill is
 
04:23:45.229 --> 04:23:45.239 align:start position:0%
that you know I haven't put in a tax
 
04:23:47.570 --> 04:23:47.580 align:start position:0%
structure I didn't put in you know eight
 
04:23:50.210 --> 04:23:50.220 align:start position:0%
and a half percent tax what I did is
 
04:23:53.210 --> 04:23:53.220 align:start position:0%
instead is is that the Liquor Commission
 
04:23:55.550 --> 04:23:55.560 align:start position:0%
will have hearings
 
04:23:57.889 --> 04:23:57.899 align:start position:0%
and once they have hired somebody who's
 
04:23:59.389 --> 04:23:59.399 align:start position:0%
a little more of an expert on the market
 
04:24:02.330 --> 04:24:02.340 align:start position:0%
and done a market analysis then we're
 
04:24:05.210 --> 04:24:05.220 align:start position:0%
better able to decide what is the best
 
04:24:08.510 --> 04:24:08.520 align:start position:0%
place for the fees for instance I I'm
 
04:24:10.910 --> 04:24:10.920 align:start position:0%
more apt to say we should be uh charging
 
04:24:13.790 --> 04:24:13.800 align:start position:0%
the fees or whatever Revenue to start it
 
04:24:16.429 --> 04:24:16.439 align:start position:0%
at the cultivation level
 
04:24:19.309 --> 04:24:19.319 align:start position:0%
that the cultivators when they ship the
 
04:24:21.229 --> 04:24:21.239 align:start position:0%
product when they sell the product to
 
04:24:23.750 --> 04:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
wherever they sell it to at that point
 
04:24:25.250 --> 04:24:25.260 align:start position:0%
is where I think we should be getting
 
04:24:28.309 --> 04:24:28.319 align:start position:0%
our cut much like we do with the beer
 
04:24:30.769 --> 04:24:30.779 align:start position:0%
tax we charge it at the at the
 
04:24:32.030 --> 04:24:32.040 align:start position:0%
production level
 
04:24:35.389 --> 04:24:35.399 align:start position:0%
so um that but it you know in terms of
 
04:24:37.189 --> 04:24:37.199 align:start position:0%
other states and that was the big thing
 
04:24:39.229 --> 04:24:39.239 align:start position:0%
when so we was looking at what all these
 
04:24:41.510 --> 04:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
other different states some of them have
 
04:24:43.969 --> 04:24:43.979 align:start position:0%
a a myriad of tax you know Revenue
 
04:24:47.090 --> 04:24:47.100 align:start position:0%
sources so they took they charged it all
 
04:24:50.570 --> 04:24:50.580 align:start position:0%
all steps of the of the process so we
 
04:24:53.090 --> 04:24:53.100 align:start position:0%
might want to do that but again that is
 
04:24:55.370 --> 04:24:55.380 align:start position:0%
something I if if we get into start
 
04:24:57.889 --> 04:24:57.899 align:start position:0%
putting specific things then you get
 
04:24:59.510 --> 04:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
friends and enemies
 
04:25:02.689 --> 04:25:02.699 align:start position:0%
on any one given issue so what I was
 
04:25:05.570 --> 04:25:05.580 align:start position:0%
trying to do was try to keep it simple
 
04:25:08.090 --> 04:25:08.100 align:start position:0%
and straightforward its Liquor
 
04:25:09.769 --> 04:25:09.779 align:start position:0%
Commission is going to be doing hearings
 
04:25:12.050 --> 04:25:12.060 align:start position:0%
process they have 16 months to go
 
04:25:14.450 --> 04:25:14.460 align:start position:0%
through all these different hearing you
 
04:25:17.389 --> 04:25:17.399 align:start position:0%
know process of what each level and as
 
04:25:18.830 --> 04:25:18.840 align:start position:0%
representative Gibb says you know why
 
04:25:20.269 --> 04:25:20.279 align:start position:0%
isn't this done by rule making well
 
04:25:23.090 --> 04:25:23.100 align:start position:0%
that's what this uh my amendment was
 
04:25:25.670 --> 04:25:25.680 align:start position:0%
attempting to do was to do it by rule
 
04:25:27.889 --> 04:25:27.899 align:start position:0%
making each step of the way that there
 
04:25:29.630 --> 04:25:29.640 align:start position:0%
would be plenty of input from the public
 
04:25:32.630 --> 04:25:32.640 align:start position:0%
from these people who are all care so
 
04:25:35.210 --> 04:25:35.220 align:start position:0%
much who want certain things they would
 
04:25:37.070 --> 04:25:37.080 align:start position:0%
have that opportunity to express it so
 
04:25:39.410 --> 04:25:39.420 align:start position:0%
if it's if some people say well you know
 
04:25:41.389 --> 04:25:41.399 align:start position:0%
we don't like how you're giving up the
 
04:25:43.969 --> 04:25:43.979 align:start position:0%
money in terms of towns and and Health
 
04:25:45.830 --> 04:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
and Human Services they want to see it
 
04:25:47.750 --> 04:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
to give into something else that should
 
04:25:49.910 --> 04:25:49.920 align:start position:0%
be happen in a Health and Human Service
 
04:25:52.189 --> 04:25:52.199 align:start position:0%
process if we really get down to going
 
04:25:54.229 --> 04:25:54.239 align:start position:0%
through all the stuff that's in this
 
04:25:56.269 --> 04:25:56.279 align:start position:0%
bill then this bill is not getting out
 
04:25:58.729 --> 04:25:58.739 align:start position:0%
now we're going to be holding on to this
 
04:26:00.590 --> 04:26:00.600 align:start position:0%
bill tonight Mr chair but isn't one of
 
04:26:03.229 --> 04:26:03.239 align:start position:0%
the main issues that
 
04:26:05.330 --> 04:26:05.340 align:start position:0%
from the folks who put this together not
 
04:26:07.670 --> 04:26:07.680 align:start position:0%
having the Liquors commissioned oversee
 
04:26:08.689 --> 04:26:08.699 align:start position:0%
this that it was going to be an
 
04:26:08.699 --> 04:26:09.769 align:start position:0%
this that it was going to be an
independent

04:26:09.769 --> 04:26:09.779 align:start position:0%
independent
 
04:26:11.570 --> 04:26:11.580 align:start position:0%
they had an independent commission yeah
 
04:26:15.530 --> 04:26:15.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:16.910 --> 04:26:16.920 align:start position:0%
how did you come up with that Amendment
 
04:26:18.410 --> 04:26:18.420 align:start position:0%
it took you you half an hour to come up
 
04:26:19.729 --> 04:26:19.739 align:start position:0%
with that amendment that you were
 
04:26:22.309 --> 04:26:22.319 align:start position:0%
proposing last time we met like who
 
04:26:23.990 --> 04:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
helped you with that Amendment yes the
 
04:26:26.149 --> 04:26:26.159 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission I did go through it
 
04:26:29.269 --> 04:26:29.279 align:start position:0%
with the Liquor Commission yes
 
04:26:31.250 --> 04:26:31.260 align:start position:0%
yes I like to ask Mr Osborne
 
04:26:32.689 --> 04:26:32.699 align:start position:0%
representative Osborne how you feel
 
04:26:34.910 --> 04:26:34.920 align:start position:0%
about the Liquor Commission overseeing
 
04:26:37.070 --> 04:26:37.080 align:start position:0%
it since you were a sponsor
 
04:26:38.510 --> 04:26:38.520 align:start position:0%
look um
 
04:26:41.149 --> 04:26:41.159 align:start position:0%
I I don't like it I don't like the
 
04:26:43.670 --> 04:26:43.680 align:start position:0%
original bill I um in a co-sponsor of a
 
04:26:45.050 --> 04:26:45.060 align:start position:0%
bill over in criminal justice that I
 
04:26:47.750 --> 04:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
prefer that simply just eliminates the
 
04:26:49.910 --> 04:26:49.920 align:start position:0%
statutory reference to marijuana but uh
 
04:26:51.469 --> 04:26:51.479 align:start position:0%
that's you know I live in the real world
 
04:26:54.229 --> 04:26:54.239 align:start position:0%
we gotta try to figure out what we can
 
04:26:56.809 --> 04:26:56.819 align:start position:0%
actually get passed through the entire
 
04:26:56.819 --> 04:26:58.370 align:start position:0%
actually get passed through the entire
process

04:26:58.370 --> 04:26:58.380 align:start position:0%
process
 
04:27:00.769 --> 04:27:00.779 align:start position:0%
um and like I said I'm I'm fine you know
 
04:27:03.710 --> 04:27:03.720 align:start position:0%
I filed this bill on behalf of uh of a
 
04:27:06.590 --> 04:27:06.600 align:start position:0%
coalition and I I will uh you know stand
 
04:27:09.410 --> 04:27:09.420 align:start position:0%
by whatever you know everybody wants to
 
04:27:09.420 --> 04:27:10.670 align:start position:0%
by whatever you know everybody wants to
do

04:27:10.670 --> 04:27:10.680 align:start position:0%
do
 
04:27:12.830 --> 04:27:12.840 align:start position:0%
um so if everybody wants to just make
 
04:27:14.990 --> 04:27:15.000 align:start position:0%
the statement about what you know our
 
04:27:17.389 --> 04:27:17.399 align:start position:0%
Ideal World that we would like to live
 
04:27:21.349 --> 04:27:21.359 align:start position:0%
in is uh I'm fine with that but if we
 
04:27:24.229 --> 04:27:24.239 align:start position:0%
want to try to actually get something
 
04:27:27.290 --> 04:27:27.300 align:start position:0%
passed into law The Liquor Commission is
 
04:27:27.300 --> 04:27:28.429 align:start position:0%
passed into law The Liquor Commission is
the

04:27:28.429 --> 04:27:28.439 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:27:31.729 --> 04:27:31.739 align:start position:0%
path to get that done
 
04:27:34.070 --> 04:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
so I'm not quite sure why you
 
04:27:37.550 --> 04:27:37.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:39.889 --> 04:27:39.899 align:start position:0%
other agents
 
04:27:41.750 --> 04:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
agents that took them a year to like
 
04:27:44.389 --> 04:27:44.399 align:start position:0%
weren't like were you a part of putting
 
04:27:45.889 --> 04:27:45.899 align:start position:0%
together this bill or did you just put
 
04:27:47.450 --> 04:27:47.460 align:start position:0%
your name on it
 
04:27:49.490 --> 04:27:49.500 align:start position:0%
uh they came to me at the end of the the
 
04:27:49.500 --> 04:27:52.250 align:start position:0%
uh they came to me at the end of the the
process

04:27:52.250 --> 04:27:52.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:53.990 --> 04:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
so he has the answers yeah he put his
 
04:27:56.090 --> 04:27:56.100 align:start position:0%
name on when they asked him
 
04:27:57.950 --> 04:27:57.960 align:start position:0%
that's all I wanted was an answer that's
 
04:27:57.960 --> 04:27:59.809 align:start position:0%
that's all I wanted was an answer that's
it

04:27:59.809 --> 04:27:59.819 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:28:01.729 --> 04:28:01.739 align:start position:0%
so are we
 
04:28:05.269 --> 04:28:05.279 align:start position:0%
are we really I mean
 
04:28:07.550 --> 04:28:07.560 align:start position:0%
I mean you you talk about you think this
 
04:28:09.830 --> 04:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
could get through which is I mean it'd
 
04:28:11.030 --> 04:28:11.040 align:start position:0%
be great if we get something through I
 
04:28:12.530 --> 04:28:12.540 align:start position:0%
I'm definitely I definitely want that
 
04:28:12.540 --> 04:28:14.149 align:start position:0%
I'm definitely I definitely want that
but

04:28:14.149 --> 04:28:14.159 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:28:15.530 --> 04:28:15.540 align:start position:0%
obviously we have to go through what we
 
04:28:17.149 --> 04:28:17.159 align:start position:0%
we want in there for sure whatever we
 
04:28:19.429 --> 04:28:19.439 align:start position:0%
push through this committee but also
 
04:28:21.170 --> 04:28:21.180 align:start position:0%
do we think that there's any reasonable
 
04:28:23.990 --> 04:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
chance that this is going I mean if the
 
04:28:25.910 --> 04:28:25.920 align:start position:0%
governor is going to veto it most likely
 
04:28:28.790 --> 04:28:28.800 align:start position:0%
if we take him out his word then
 
04:28:31.309 --> 04:28:31.319 align:start position:0%
I would say let's let's lean on a
 
04:28:32.809 --> 04:28:32.819 align:start position:0%
statement of what the best build is we
 
04:28:35.929 --> 04:28:35.939 align:start position:0%
can signal for next year or whenever in
 
04:28:37.610 --> 04:28:37.620 align:start position:0%
the future that that's my thinking on it
 
04:28:39.110 --> 04:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
but if somebody else has a different
 
04:28:40.790 --> 04:28:40.800 align:start position:0%
view on it let me know I mean I think
 
04:28:43.189 --> 04:28:43.199 align:start position:0%
let's put the best Bill we think we
 
04:28:45.410 --> 04:28:45.420 align:start position:0%
would like to see and if we can't get
 
04:28:47.450 --> 04:28:47.460 align:start position:0%
that then release because it sounds like
 
04:28:48.710 --> 04:28:48.720 align:start position:0%
we're going to get nothing is my guess
 
04:28:50.929 --> 04:28:50.939 align:start position:0%
if I'm wrong in that then you know right
 
04:28:53.269 --> 04:28:53.279 align:start position:0%
tell me you think I'm wrong but if if we
 
04:28:55.250 --> 04:28:55.260 align:start position:0%
actually think the chances of us passing
 
04:28:58.309 --> 04:28:58.319 align:start position:0%
anything related to this topic are slim
 
04:29:00.170 --> 04:29:00.180 align:start position:0%
to none then let's push through what we
 
04:29:02.090 --> 04:29:02.100 align:start position:0%
think is is best to give a blueprint for
 
04:29:02.990 --> 04:29:03.000 align:start position:0%
the next
 
04:29:04.969 --> 04:29:04.979 align:start position:0%
the next session the next year then
 
04:29:06.710 --> 04:29:06.720 align:start position:0%
whatever when maybe we have a more
 
04:29:08.689 --> 04:29:08.699 align:start position:0%
favorable environment that that's my
 
04:29:09.950 --> 04:29:09.960 align:start position:0%
view on it
 
04:29:13.610 --> 04:29:13.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:16.070 --> 04:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
I I I'm just I'm at a loss I feel like
 
04:29:18.830 --> 04:29:18.840 align:start position:0%
this is like uh binge watching The Jerry
 
04:29:20.990 --> 04:29:21.000 align:start position:0%
Springer Show I mean it just you know
 
04:29:24.050 --> 04:29:24.060 align:start position:0%
one one episode after another another I
 
04:29:26.630 --> 04:29:26.640 align:start position:0%
think it's been how many times six and
 
04:29:28.309 --> 04:29:28.319 align:start position:0%
um I'd really like to figure out a way
 
04:29:29.809 --> 04:29:29.819 align:start position:0%
that we could we could get something
 
04:29:31.610 --> 04:29:31.620 align:start position:0%
through but
 
04:29:31.620 --> 04:29:32.870 align:start position:0%
through but
um

04:29:32.870 --> 04:29:32.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:29:34.370 --> 04:29:34.380 align:start position:0%
I don't know what the answer is I really
 
04:29:34.380 --> 04:29:35.090 align:start position:0%
I don't know what the answer is I really
don't

04:29:35.090 --> 04:29:35.100 align:start position:0%
don't
 
04:29:37.849 --> 04:29:37.859 align:start position:0%
well I think I had the answer that's the
 
04:29:40.670 --> 04:29:40.680 align:start position:0%
whole point that I I I the signals the
 
04:29:43.670 --> 04:29:43.680 align:start position:0%
hand signals that I was getting is from
 
04:29:46.010 --> 04:29:46.020 align:start position:0%
when from the Senators
 
04:29:47.510 --> 04:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
okay and I'm not talking about the
 
04:29:48.530 --> 04:29:48.540 align:start position:0%
governor now
 
04:29:50.210 --> 04:29:50.220 align:start position:0%
from the Senators
 
04:29:53.030 --> 04:29:53.040 align:start position:0%
well Comfort level was
 
04:29:55.610 --> 04:29:55.620 align:start position:0%
um was what we had you know originally
 
04:29:57.410 --> 04:29:57.420 align:start position:0%
introduced you know last year which was
 
04:29:59.450 --> 04:29:59.460 align:start position:0%
the idea that the Liquor Commission was
 
04:30:01.610 --> 04:30:01.620 align:start position:0%
going to run it
 
04:30:04.130 --> 04:30:04.140 align:start position:0%
obviously after thinking about it and
 
04:30:05.870 --> 04:30:05.880 align:start position:0%
trying really hard to figure out a way
 
04:30:08.870 --> 04:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
to make that work it's obvious that that
 
04:30:11.689 --> 04:30:11.699 align:start position:0%
the the right way to do it is the way
 
04:30:13.729 --> 04:30:13.739 align:start position:0%
the Liquor Commission Now enforces not
 
04:30:15.469 --> 04:30:15.479 align:start position:0%
so much the liquor but how we enforce
 
04:30:17.870 --> 04:30:17.880 align:start position:0%
the tobacco and that is we deal with
 
04:30:20.450 --> 04:30:20.460 align:start position:0%
licensees and the licensees deal with
 
04:30:24.410 --> 04:30:24.420 align:start position:0%
you know the the producers and the tax
 
04:30:27.349 --> 04:30:27.359 align:start position:0%
um and you know I think I've no one's
 
04:30:28.969 --> 04:30:28.979 align:start position:0%
ever complained to me or ever said
 
04:30:30.290 --> 04:30:30.300 align:start position:0%
anything that the Liquor Commission does
 
04:30:33.830 --> 04:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
a lousy job of regulating uh cigarettes
 
04:30:35.450 --> 04:30:35.460 align:start position:0%
you know in terms of the taxing and
 
04:30:38.050 --> 04:30:38.060 align:start position:0%
enforcement and and doing their stings
 
04:30:40.370 --> 04:30:40.380 align:start position:0%
and making sure that young people don't
 
04:30:43.189 --> 04:30:43.199 align:start position:0%
get you know sold so that that the idea
 
04:30:47.630 --> 04:30:47.640 align:start position:0%
was that I realized that everybody had
 
04:30:47.640 --> 04:30:48.410 align:start position:0%
was that I realized that everybody had
um

04:30:48.410 --> 04:30:48.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:30:50.689 --> 04:30:50.699 align:start position:0%
there are lots of other issues I'm going
 
04:30:52.610 --> 04:30:52.620 align:start position:0%
to listen to law enforcement and I
 
04:30:54.229 --> 04:30:54.239 align:start position:0%
listened to you know in terms of these
 
04:30:55.490 --> 04:30:55.500 align:start position:0%
different organizations who are looking
 
04:30:58.250 --> 04:30:58.260 align:start position:0%
for monies and how to get the money or
 
04:31:01.130 --> 04:31:01.140 align:start position:0%
or even the at you know the uh the the
 
04:31:03.349 --> 04:31:03.359 align:start position:0%
medical marijuana atcs whatever they
 
04:31:05.769 --> 04:31:05.779 align:start position:0%
call them so
 
04:31:09.229 --> 04:31:09.239 align:start position:0%
my goal was to take out of the bill all
 
04:31:11.649 --> 04:31:11.659 align:start position:0%
that stuff extraneous stuff
 
04:31:16.070 --> 04:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
and keep it simple to that
 
04:31:18.769 --> 04:31:18.779 align:start position:0%
that is a framework
 
04:31:21.590 --> 04:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
to get this legislation passed
 
04:31:24.410 --> 04:31:24.420 align:start position:0%
knowing full well that that yes it gives
 
04:31:26.929 --> 04:31:26.939 align:start position:0%
a lot of power to the rulemaking process
 
04:31:29.630 --> 04:31:29.640 align:start position:0%
at the you know the Liquor Commission
 
04:31:31.670 --> 04:31:31.680 align:start position:0%
you know because they obviously they're
 
04:31:33.229 --> 04:31:33.239 align:start position:0%
the ones who certainly have done plenty
 
04:31:35.090 --> 04:31:35.100 align:start position:0%
of rulemaking and and when it comes to
 
04:31:37.969 --> 04:31:37.979 align:start position:0%
either cigarettes or alcohol but they
 
04:31:40.130 --> 04:31:40.140 align:start position:0%
have a process and he'll have plenty of
 
04:31:42.649 --> 04:31:42.659 align:start position:0%
opportunity for public input in all
 
04:31:45.969 --> 04:31:45.979 align:start position:0%
those steps to get there
 
04:31:49.130 --> 04:31:49.140 align:start position:0%
and that when it comes to what is the
 
04:31:51.349 --> 04:31:51.359 align:start position:0%
right taxation what is the right I mean
 
04:31:52.910 --> 04:31:52.920 align:start position:0%
what is the right uh what is it
 
04:31:54.889 --> 04:31:54.899 align:start position:0%
someone's complaining about how much THC
 
04:31:57.889 --> 04:31:57.899 align:start position:0%
is in there you know all those things we
 
04:31:59.269 --> 04:31:59.279 align:start position:0%
have written in this bill the way I've
 
04:32:01.070 --> 04:32:01.080 align:start position:0%
written it it was that's going to go
 
04:32:03.469 --> 04:32:03.479 align:start position:0%
through a rule making process and have
 
04:32:05.330 --> 04:32:05.340 align:start position:0%
it processed and I and I just think that
 
04:32:08.149 --> 04:32:08.159 align:start position:0%
that when it comes to people who have
 
04:32:08.159 --> 04:32:09.349 align:start position:0%
that when it comes to people who have
been

04:32:09.349 --> 04:32:09.359 align:start position:0%
been
 
04:32:11.750 --> 04:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
um fearful of passing the marrow the
 
04:32:14.590 --> 04:32:14.600 align:start position:0%
original marijuana bills is because
 
04:32:17.929 --> 04:32:17.939 align:start position:0%
you're worried about this piece or that
 
04:32:19.370 --> 04:32:19.380 align:start position:0%
piece or this affirmative value this
 
04:32:21.170 --> 04:32:21.180 align:start position:0%
thing but when the end of the day's here
 
04:32:22.729 --> 04:32:22.739 align:start position:0%
do you really want to pass it or not and
 
04:32:24.050 --> 04:32:24.060 align:start position:0%
they said well I want to pass something
 
04:32:26.389 --> 04:32:26.399 align:start position:0%
so the only way we can get moving
 
04:32:28.849 --> 04:32:28.859 align:start position:0%
forward is to begin that process to
 
04:32:30.950 --> 04:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
having hearing process to take those
 
04:32:32.510 --> 04:32:32.520 align:start position:0%
different steps
 
04:32:34.429 --> 04:32:34.439 align:start position:0%
but at the end of the day it's about
 
04:32:37.309 --> 04:32:37.319 align:start position:0%
licensure and as much as I would love to
 
04:32:37.319 --> 04:32:38.210 align:start position:0%
licensure and as much as I would love to
have

04:32:38.210 --> 04:32:38.220 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:32:39.830 --> 04:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
State Stores that's just not going to
 
04:32:39.840 --> 04:32:41.030 align:start position:0%
State Stores that's just not going to
happen

04:32:41.030 --> 04:32:41.040 align:start position:0%
happen
 
04:32:44.030 --> 04:32:44.040 align:start position:0%
um but it you know it is to have
 
04:32:46.189 --> 04:32:46.199 align:start position:0%
um as someone who an entity that's known
 
04:32:48.349 --> 04:32:48.359 align:start position:0%
how to do this they do a good I think
 
04:32:50.269 --> 04:32:50.279 align:start position:0%
they do a good job they bring in a hell
 
04:32:52.490 --> 04:32:52.500 align:start position:0%
of a lot of money to the state because
 
04:32:54.110 --> 04:32:54.120 align:start position:0%
their motivations are in the right place
 
04:32:57.769 --> 04:32:57.779 align:start position:0%
how to maximize the profit and I realize
 
04:32:59.030 --> 04:32:59.040 align:start position:0%
that I'm not going to please all the
 
04:33:01.490 --> 04:33:01.500 align:start position:0%
people all the time but if there's you
 
04:33:03.410 --> 04:33:03.420 align:start position:0%
know specific things in this list of
 
04:33:05.570 --> 04:33:05.580 align:start position:0%
what they were looking at
 
04:33:07.849 --> 04:33:07.859 align:start position:0%
um that you really think that needs to
 
04:33:11.209 --> 04:33:11.219 align:start position:0%
be addressed or need to be solved rather
 
04:33:13.730 --> 04:33:13.740 align:start position:0%
than waiting for rules then uh certainly
 
04:33:16.849 --> 04:33:16.859 align:start position:0%
willing to discuss it but to pass that
 
04:33:19.250 --> 04:33:19.260 align:start position:0%
bill in its current form
 
04:33:22.369 --> 04:33:22.379 align:start position:0%
it's just it's got too many too many
 
04:33:24.769 --> 04:33:24.779 align:start position:0%
words on it I guess of the way I would
 
04:33:26.869 --> 04:33:26.879 align:start position:0%
call it well thought out I'd no doubt is
 
04:33:28.131 --> 04:33:28.141 align:start position:0%
well thought out because they covered
 
04:33:30.349 --> 04:33:30.359 align:start position:0%
everything but did I mean maybe I'm
 
04:33:31.849 --> 04:33:31.859 align:start position:0%
wrong I thought that you had pulled that
 
04:33:33.949 --> 04:33:33.959 align:start position:0%
Amendment that's what we had heard that
 
04:33:35.390 --> 04:33:35.400 align:start position:0%
you pulled that Amendment what do you
 
04:33:37.490 --> 04:33:37.500 align:start position:0%
mean by pulled that you pulled that you
 
04:33:38.810 --> 04:33:38.820 align:start position:0%
were not putting it Forward anymore
 
04:33:40.250 --> 04:33:40.260 align:start position:0%
that's not true
 
04:33:43.730 --> 04:33:43.740 align:start position:0%
I I the the the the amendment I have in
 
04:33:45.590 --> 04:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
front of you is is the amendment that I
 
04:33:46.730 --> 04:33:46.740 align:start position:0%
want to go okay you do want to go
 
04:33:49.070 --> 04:33:49.080 align:start position:0%
through okay that what the problem was
 
04:33:51.650 --> 04:33:51.660 align:start position:0%
is I was misspoke speaking about what I
 
04:33:54.289 --> 04:33:54.299 align:start position:0%
thought was in it okay because I had
 
04:33:57.769 --> 04:33:57.779 align:start position:0%
this concept and it and it changed so
 
04:34:01.789 --> 04:34:01.799 align:start position:0%
that and the the big change was that we
 
04:34:03.590 --> 04:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
were not going to do the rfps for the
 
04:34:05.330 --> 04:34:05.340 align:start position:0%
life you know who would be operating the
 
04:34:07.609 --> 04:34:07.619 align:start position:0%
stores that we are going to have a
 
04:34:11.330 --> 04:34:11.340 align:start position:0%
licensing and that um we will certainly
 
04:34:13.490 --> 04:34:13.500 align:start position:0%
give guidelines for the zoning and let
 
04:34:15.650 --> 04:34:15.660 align:start position:0%
in terms of towns and what you know what
 
04:34:17.570 --> 04:34:17.580 align:start position:0%
they're going to do with zoning and they
 
04:34:19.551 --> 04:34:19.561 align:start position:0%
will determine where or how many they
 
04:34:21.529 --> 04:34:21.539 align:start position:0%
want in their Community
 
04:34:23.990 --> 04:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
um in terms of so that so there really
 
04:34:26.209 --> 04:34:26.219 align:start position:0%
is no limit to the amount of numbers of
 
04:34:28.070 --> 04:34:28.080 align:start position:0%
them even though it says in the end that
 
04:34:29.869 --> 04:34:29.879 align:start position:0%
the commission may limit to them so so
 
04:34:31.730 --> 04:34:31.740 align:start position:0%
the commission will have a public
 
04:34:31.740 --> 04:34:32.750 align:start position:0%
the commission will have a public
hearing

04:34:32.750 --> 04:34:32.760 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
04:34:35.810 --> 04:34:35.820 align:start position:0%
and get inputs from all anybody who
 
04:34:38.209 --> 04:34:38.219 align:start position:0%
wants to input on what is the
 
04:34:39.890 --> 04:34:39.900 align:start position:0%
appropriate whether we should limit
 
04:34:42.769 --> 04:34:42.779 align:start position:0%
license or not or whether you know or or
 
04:34:44.869 --> 04:34:44.879 align:start position:0%
what that is so that would done all by
 
04:34:46.131 --> 04:34:46.141 align:start position:0%
public hearing and to be a public
 
04:34:48.470 --> 04:34:48.480 align:start position:0%
process rather than for me to just pick
 
04:34:50.390 --> 04:34:50.400 align:start position:0%
a number and pull out of my you know my
 
04:34:52.429 --> 04:34:52.439 align:start position:0%
hat and just stick it in there
 
04:34:54.830 --> 04:34:54.840 align:start position:0%
um you know it it it gives it
 
04:34:56.631 --> 04:34:56.641 align:start position:0%
opportunity so that all these people
 
04:34:58.010 --> 04:34:58.020 align:start position:0%
were all these issues that they have
 
04:35:00.289 --> 04:35:00.299 align:start position:0%
they can certainly bring them but I
 
04:35:02.869 --> 04:35:02.879 align:start position:0%
didn't want to I absolutely I'll have
 
04:35:02.879 --> 04:35:04.070 align:start position:0%
didn't want to I absolutely I'll have
I'm

04:35:04.070 --> 04:35:04.080 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
04:35:07.490 --> 04:35:07.500 align:start position:0%
we'll admit no I was taking out things
 
04:35:10.730 --> 04:35:10.740 align:start position:0%
that were unrelated to how we were going
 
04:35:13.010 --> 04:35:13.020 align:start position:0%
to structure a system to sell it in the
 
04:35:14.631 --> 04:35:14.641 align:start position:0%
state and that is that like the
 
04:35:16.670 --> 04:35:16.680 align:start position:0%
Homegrown you know I just said this you
 
04:35:18.051 --> 04:35:18.061 align:start position:0%
know and and
 
04:35:20.150 --> 04:35:20.160 align:start position:0%
like I say I once I found out it was in
 
04:35:22.789 --> 04:35:22.799 align:start position:0%
already that bill is already exists you
 
04:35:25.910 --> 04:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
know why why put it in this bill why we
 
04:35:27.590 --> 04:35:27.600 align:start position:0%
don't you know I have the old saying we
 
04:35:28.849 --> 04:35:28.859 align:start position:0%
don't want to create a Christmas tree
 
04:35:32.510 --> 04:35:32.520 align:start position:0%
here we want to keep it simple and keep
 
04:35:34.970 --> 04:35:34.980 align:start position:0%
the focused on what this bill what's the
 
04:35:36.470 --> 04:35:36.480 align:start position:0%
bill is attempting to do
 
04:35:40.131 --> 04:35:40.141 align:start position:0%
so all I ask is is uh read it read the
 
04:35:42.650 --> 04:35:42.660 align:start position:0%
read that Amendment with that light that
 
04:35:44.510 --> 04:35:44.520 align:start position:0%
you know what that is there something if
 
04:35:45.949 --> 04:35:45.959 align:start position:0%
you see something in these where people
 
04:35:48.170 --> 04:35:48.180 align:start position:0%
say we really need to create this issue
 
04:35:51.170 --> 04:35:51.180 align:start position:0%
or put it in there you know uh
 
04:35:52.910 --> 04:35:52.920 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
04:35:55.070 --> 04:35:55.080 align:start position:0%
this is a big change do you think we
 
04:35:57.349 --> 04:35:57.359 align:start position:0%
should um like have like a public
 
04:35:59.810 --> 04:35:59.820 align:start position:0%
hearings exactly what I'm thinking this
 
04:36:01.131 --> 04:36:01.141 align:start position:0%
isn't like a little Amendment this is
 
04:36:03.349 --> 04:36:03.359 align:start position:0%
like yeah plus I think I think a lot of
 
04:36:04.849 --> 04:36:04.859 align:start position:0%
the Republicans have not seen that
 
04:36:04.859 --> 04:36:05.990 align:start position:0%
the Republicans have not seen that
document

04:36:05.990 --> 04:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
document
 
04:36:07.849 --> 04:36:07.859 align:start position:0%
um delineating what what some of the
 
04:36:09.949 --> 04:36:09.959 align:start position:0%
perceived problems are from that that
 
04:36:11.570 --> 04:36:11.580 align:start position:0%
group that put the original Bill
 
04:36:14.330 --> 04:36:14.340 align:start position:0%
together right I agree with Jared 100 I
 
04:36:16.789 --> 04:36:16.799 align:start position:0%
I'd like to hear from the stakeholders
 
04:36:16.799 --> 04:36:18.289 align:start position:0%
I'd like to hear from the stakeholders
okay

04:36:18.289 --> 04:36:18.299 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:36:20.029 --> 04:36:20.039 align:start position:0%
but but they're going to be asking to
 
04:36:21.470 --> 04:36:21.480 align:start position:0%
put some of these things back into the
 
04:36:23.689 --> 04:36:23.699 align:start position:0%
building probably yeah so I what I'm
 
04:36:26.269 --> 04:36:26.279 align:start position:0%
asking you is do you get you go through
 
04:36:28.010 --> 04:36:28.020 align:start position:0%
and tell me which ones you think really
 
04:36:29.869 --> 04:36:29.879 align:start position:0%
should be put back in the bill well
 
04:36:31.910 --> 04:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
again I think I couldn't tell you for
 
04:36:34.609 --> 04:36:34.619 align:start position:0%
sure the one that bothers me the most is
 
04:36:37.010 --> 04:36:37.020 align:start position:0%
the idea that there could be anybody
 
04:36:38.689 --> 04:36:38.699 align:start position:0%
saying that there should be a fixed
 
04:36:40.189 --> 04:36:40.199 align:start position:0%
number and I know that you just
 
04:36:41.810 --> 04:36:41.820 align:start position:0%
explained that that's not what you're it
 
04:36:43.970 --> 04:36:43.980 align:start position:0%
actually it did it did it say that in
 
04:36:45.709 --> 04:36:45.719 align:start position:0%
the bill I might when I read the
 
04:36:47.209 --> 04:36:47.219 align:start position:0%
amendment it said the commission will
 
04:36:49.490 --> 04:36:49.500 align:start position:0%
determine you know and that's what I'm
 
04:36:50.929 --> 04:36:50.939 align:start position:0%
concerned about I I don't think that
 
04:36:53.390 --> 04:36:53.400 align:start position:0%
there should be anybody determining I
 
04:36:55.310 --> 04:36:55.320 align:start position:0%
think if somebody is qualified based on
 
04:36:57.289 --> 04:36:57.299 align:start position:0%
whatever the rules are that are decided
 
04:36:58.310 --> 04:36:58.320 align:start position:0%
at some point in the future it sounds
 
04:36:59.990 --> 04:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
like to the rulemaking process so if
 
04:37:01.429 --> 04:37:01.439 align:start position:0%
those rules are I don't know you can't
 
04:37:02.750 --> 04:37:02.760 align:start position:0%
have a felony and you have to be
 
04:37:04.970 --> 04:37:04.980 align:start position:0%
financially sound and you some other
 
04:37:06.830 --> 04:37:06.840 align:start position:0%
regulation okay then you should get
 
04:37:09.051 --> 04:37:09.061 align:start position:0%
approved I don't think I think we could
 
04:37:11.090 --> 04:37:11.100 align:start position:0%
easily here's what I'm afraid of I think
 
04:37:13.789 --> 04:37:13.799 align:start position:0%
we could easily end up in the New York
 
04:37:16.490 --> 04:37:16.500 align:start position:0%
City taxi cab medallion situation where
 
04:37:18.830 --> 04:37:18.840 align:start position:0%
we start off yep with money initial
 
04:37:20.209 --> 04:37:20.219 align:start position:0%
rules and then next thing you know those
 
04:37:21.529 --> 04:37:21.539 align:start position:0%
people are fighting tooth and nail never
 
04:37:23.869 --> 04:37:23.879 align:start position:0%
to be 20. I I absolutely we want to
 
04:37:27.789 --> 04:37:27.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:30.590 --> 04:37:30.600 align:start position:0%
if you take that amendment I would we
 
04:37:32.209 --> 04:37:32.219 align:start position:0%
could remove that line that rulemaking
 
04:37:34.970 --> 04:37:34.980 align:start position:0%
line because it's in rule making
 
04:37:44.810 --> 04:37:44.820 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:49.070 --> 04:37:49.080 align:start position:0%
all over the state so now it's the bill
 
04:37:51.230 --> 04:37:51.240 align:start position:0%
that you don't want to pass you're just
 
04:37:52.910 --> 04:37:52.920 align:start position:0%
saying that the amendment that my
 
04:37:54.709 --> 04:37:54.719 align:start position:0%
amendment has that where where does my
 
04:37:57.949 --> 04:37:57.959 align:start position:0%
amendment has it creates cultivators
 
04:38:00.769 --> 04:38:00.779 align:start position:0%
it creates manufacturers who then
 
04:38:03.410 --> 04:38:03.420 align:start position:0%
process that cannabis and creates
 
04:38:06.109 --> 04:38:06.119 align:start position:0%
retailers all theoretically could be
 
04:38:07.670 --> 04:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
small businesses I don't understand why
 
04:38:09.949 --> 04:38:09.959 align:start position:0%
you weren't the commission and how you
 
04:38:11.570 --> 04:38:11.580 align:start position:0%
adjust what do you mean whatever I mean
 
04:38:13.789 --> 04:38:13.799 align:start position:0%
it the committee to
 
04:38:21.109 --> 04:38:21.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:23.090 --> 04:38:23.100 align:start position:0%
it's the way we should proceed I think
 
04:38:25.070 --> 04:38:25.080 align:start position:0%
we need to be representing the people
 
04:38:28.250 --> 04:38:28.260 align:start position:0%
and not agencies and not the governor
 
04:38:31.670 --> 04:38:31.680 align:start position:0%
I and I I'm again this is not about the
 
04:38:35.029 --> 04:38:35.039 align:start position:0%
governor for me for me it's about
 
04:38:37.970 --> 04:38:37.980 align:start position:0%
um this is what I do as a as a and
 
04:38:39.289 --> 04:38:39.299 align:start position:0%
you've seen me over the years Paul
 
04:38:41.390 --> 04:38:41.400 align:start position:0%
rabbit you know I I pull rabbits out of
 
04:38:44.269 --> 04:38:44.279 align:start position:0%
that I take bills complicated issues and
 
04:38:46.131 --> 04:38:46.141 align:start position:0%
I find a solution that we all can agree
 
04:38:49.910 --> 04:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
on and so what I was doing is that that
 
04:38:52.310 --> 04:38:52.320 align:start position:0%
I was taking a bill that had was chock
 
04:38:55.189 --> 04:38:55.199 align:start position:0%
full of lots of stuff in it no doubt and
 
04:38:57.470 --> 04:38:57.480 align:start position:0%
then we and we still have another bill
 
04:38:59.090 --> 04:38:59.100 align:start position:0%
you know we still have two bills yep
 
04:39:02.390 --> 04:39:02.400 align:start position:0%
okay and this one unfortunately has had
 
04:39:04.490 --> 04:39:04.500 align:start position:0%
an early departure date so that's why I
 
04:39:06.349 --> 04:39:06.359 align:start position:0%
was working from this
 
04:39:06.359 --> 04:39:07.551 align:start position:0%
was working from this
but

04:39:07.551 --> 04:39:07.561 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:39:09.830 --> 04:39:09.840 align:start position:0%
um if you guys you know if you're really
 
04:39:13.010 --> 04:39:13.020 align:start position:0%
if you really want to pass it as in that
 
04:39:15.410 --> 04:39:15.420 align:start position:0%
current form and then see it I don't
 
04:39:16.849 --> 04:39:16.859 align:start position:0%
even think that one will make out of the
 
04:39:19.970 --> 04:39:19.980 align:start position:0%
Senate okay so and then have it die and
 
04:39:22.010 --> 04:39:22.020 align:start position:0%
then we still have the other bill and we
 
04:39:23.810 --> 04:39:23.820 align:start position:0%
can just retain that and then we can
 
04:39:27.709 --> 04:39:27.719 align:start position:0%
spend all summer you know wait all fall
 
04:39:30.349 --> 04:39:30.359 align:start position:0%
getting people to buy into it and then
 
04:39:32.929 --> 04:39:32.939 align:start position:0%
bring it up bring something out in in
 
04:39:36.650 --> 04:39:36.660 align:start position:0%
January I just feel our committee today
 
04:39:39.050 --> 04:39:39.060 align:start position:0%
is handicapped because I know some of
 
04:39:41.330 --> 04:39:41.340 align:start position:0%
you haven't seen this I I presume
 
04:39:42.708 --> 04:39:42.718 align:start position:0%
representative post you haven't seen
 
04:39:45.230 --> 04:39:45.240 align:start position:0%
this document and representative for
 
04:39:48.110 --> 04:39:48.120 align:start position:0%
Sally you
 
04:39:52.430 --> 04:39:52.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:55.130 --> 04:39:55.140 align:start position:0%
okay but you're allowed to to talk
 
04:39:57.830 --> 04:39:57.840 align:start position:0%
during the students everybody can have
 
04:40:00.230 --> 04:40:00.240 align:start position:0%
an opinion representative filio do you
 
04:40:02.868 --> 04:40:02.878 align:start position:0%
have a comment
 
04:40:05.330 --> 04:40:05.340 align:start position:0%
uh no no comment just listening to the
 
04:40:08.448 --> 04:40:08.458 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:10.130 --> 04:40:10.140 align:start position:0%
no opinion
 
04:40:11.750 --> 04:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
I have plenty of opinions there's none
 
04:40:13.310 --> 04:40:13.320 align:start position:0%
I'm going to state
 
04:40:17.270 --> 04:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:19.910 --> 04:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
well I just I wonder if you know we
 
04:40:21.590 --> 04:40:21.600 align:start position:0%
could give people in this room an
 
04:40:24.350 --> 04:40:24.360 align:start position:0%
opportunity to review all this and maybe
 
04:40:26.750 --> 04:40:26.760 align:start position:0%
we come back with the stakeholders and
 
04:40:28.430 --> 04:40:28.440 align:start position:0%
we hash out what we can live with and
 
04:40:30.530 --> 04:40:30.540 align:start position:0%
what we can't live with
 
04:40:32.990 --> 04:40:33.000 align:start position:0%
so who mailed it out whose email that's
 
04:40:36.530 --> 04:40:36.540 align:start position:0%
from the um marijuana policy what what
 
04:40:38.090 --> 04:40:38.100 align:start position:0%
would have been the email person who
 
04:40:42.350 --> 04:40:42.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:45.610 --> 04:40:45.620 align:start position:0%
says my name on the top yeah well
 
04:40:51.170 --> 04:40:51.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:53.630 --> 04:40:53.640 align:start position:0%
marijuana policy project
 
04:40:57.590 --> 04:40:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:57.600 --> 04:40:58.730 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:40:58.730 --> 04:40:58.740 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:40:58.740 --> 04:41:04.550 align:start position:0%
okay
uh

04:41:04.550 --> 04:41:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:08.208 --> 04:41:08.218 align:start position:0%
reject chairman Hunt's Amendment okay
 
04:41:10.730 --> 04:41:10.740 align:start position:0%
okay so is there anybody here who wrote
 
04:41:12.890 --> 04:41:12.900 align:start position:0%
These memos
 
04:41:12.900 --> 04:41:15.530 align:start position:0%
These memos
nothing

04:41:15.530 --> 04:41:15.540 align:start position:0%
nothing
 
04:41:17.810 --> 04:41:17.820 align:start position:0%
you can cover your face does anybody
 
04:41:19.190 --> 04:41:19.200 align:start position:0%
want to come up here and tell me what's
 
04:41:20.990 --> 04:41:21.000 align:start position:0%
really missing from my amendment that
 
04:41:23.930 --> 04:41:23.940 align:start position:0%
they want to see back in it
 
04:41:28.010 --> 04:41:28.020 align:start position:0%
it just is atcs okay
 
04:41:30.590 --> 04:41:30.600 align:start position:0%
so yes I took atcs out because they have
 
04:41:33.770 --> 04:41:33.780 align:start position:0%
a law they have a structure that if the
 
04:41:37.610 --> 04:41:37.620 align:start position:0%
atcs want to uh to be in this business
 
04:41:40.250 --> 04:41:40.260 align:start position:0%
and and you know wanted to do it that
 
04:41:41.868 --> 04:41:41.878 align:start position:0%
there there's nothing stopping them from
 
04:41:57.190 --> 04:41:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:00.050 --> 04:42:00.060 align:start position:0%
what's that
 
04:42:01.970 --> 04:42:01.980 align:start position:0%
no the nonprofit I've killed that bill
 
04:42:03.530 --> 04:42:03.540 align:start position:0%
multiple times I don't know about your
 
04:42:03.540 --> 04:42:08.930 align:start position:0%
multiple times I don't know about your
time

04:42:08.930 --> 04:42:08.940 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:15.530 --> 04:42:15.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:20.690 --> 04:42:20.700 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:22.990 --> 04:42:23.000 align:start position:0%
no no that's not not when I was chair
 
04:42:25.310 --> 04:42:25.320 align:start position:0%
that was when I was I was in the
 
04:42:25.320 --> 04:42:29.208 align:start position:0%
that was when I was I was in the
minority

04:42:29.208 --> 04:42:29.218 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:29.218 --> 04:42:31.690 align:start position:0%
 
really

04:42:31.690 --> 04:42:31.700 align:start position:0%
really
 
04:42:34.430 --> 04:42:34.440 align:start position:0%
I guess I guess I'm getting old in my
 
04:42:37.128 --> 04:42:37.138 align:start position:0%
Village okay so I've always been about
 
04:42:39.110 --> 04:42:39.120 align:start position:0%
against this non-profit side they you
 
04:42:40.670 --> 04:42:40.680 align:start position:0%
know this is the thing that it gets me
 
04:42:43.010 --> 04:42:43.020 align:start position:0%
when somebody makes a deal
 
04:42:44.930 --> 04:42:44.940 align:start position:0%
well you make it I got a guy that one
 
04:42:47.990 --> 04:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
guy you know in in Derry and he's
 
04:42:50.330 --> 04:42:50.340 align:start position:0%
bitching about the five percent and he
 
04:42:53.030 --> 04:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
wants to go to beer 30 and when I
 
04:42:56.270 --> 04:42:56.280 align:start position:0%
explained to him that his forefather he
 
04:42:57.530 --> 04:42:57.540 align:start position:0%
might have not been in the room his
 
04:42:59.510 --> 04:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
Winery was in the business but all the
 
04:43:00.830 --> 04:43:00.840 align:start position:0%
other guys in the wine business were
 
04:43:02.990 --> 04:43:03.000 align:start position:0%
perfectly fine with the five percent so
 
04:43:04.610 --> 04:43:04.620 align:start position:0%
to come back and say for us to change it
 
04:43:06.708 --> 04:43:06.718 align:start position:0%
now was ridiculous so were you in the
 
04:43:07.788 --> 04:43:07.798 align:start position:0%
room when they came up with that
 
04:43:09.948 --> 04:43:09.958 align:start position:0%
non-profit did you agree to that were
 
04:43:19.690 --> 04:43:19.700 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:23.750 --> 04:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
okay so here's my attitude about them
 
04:43:27.350 --> 04:43:27.360 align:start position:0%
my attitude is that if they want if we
 
04:43:30.230 --> 04:43:30.240 align:start position:0%
do pass a marijuana legislation
 
04:43:32.270 --> 04:43:32.280 align:start position:0%
if we do pass it
 
04:43:35.330 --> 04:43:35.340 align:start position:0%
and they come in and said we want to
 
04:43:38.690 --> 04:43:38.700 align:start position:0%
open up our own retail store
 
04:43:44.090 --> 04:43:44.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:47.090 --> 04:43:47.100 align:start position:0%
because I because I was ignoring the
 
04:43:49.190 --> 04:43:49.200 align:start position:0%
atcs I was trying to keep them out of
 
04:43:57.850 --> 04:43:57.860 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:01.070 --> 04:44:01.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:01.080 --> 04:44:02.390 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:44:02.390 --> 04:44:02.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:44:06.470 --> 04:44:06.480 align:start position:0%
okay I I can certainly revise that
 
04:44:09.288 --> 04:44:09.298 align:start position:0%
I can certainly revise that is it uh
 
04:44:11.868 --> 04:44:11.878 align:start position:0%
um yeah but we could certainly look and
 
04:44:15.530 --> 04:44:15.540 align:start position:0%
so you would you think that the ATC well
 
04:44:16.910 --> 04:44:16.920 align:start position:0%
actually I would think it'd be great for
 
04:44:20.090 --> 04:44:20.100 align:start position:0%
the atcs to become licensed
 
04:44:22.910 --> 04:44:22.920 align:start position:0%
but that means HHS might not be happy
 
04:44:24.170 --> 04:44:24.180 align:start position:0%
that they're not they're going to lose
 
04:44:29.390 --> 04:44:29.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:31.128 --> 04:44:31.138 align:start position:0%
no just take it started in their own
 
04:44:32.930 --> 04:44:32.940 align:start position:0%
business yeah why wouldn't they want to
 
04:44:40.610 --> 04:44:40.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:45.970 --> 04:44:45.980 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:48.890 --> 04:44:48.900 align:start position:0%
no no no no no
 
04:44:51.350 --> 04:44:51.360 align:start position:0%
that because that's a policy decision
 
04:44:53.868 --> 04:44:53.878 align:start position:0%
that is separate from this bill this
 
04:44:56.990 --> 04:44:57.000 align:start position:0%
bill is about how do we allow legal
 
04:44:59.330 --> 04:44:59.340 align:start position:0%
cannabis use
 
04:45:02.208 --> 04:45:02.218 align:start position:0%
for recreational purposes they're not
 
04:45:10.910 --> 04:45:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:12.650 --> 04:45:12.660 align:start position:0%
okay here's what here's what I would
 
04:45:15.230 --> 04:45:15.240 align:start position:0%
like to do when we take up this next
 
04:45:15.240 --> 04:45:16.128 align:start position:0%
like to do when we take up this next
week

04:45:16.128 --> 04:45:16.138 align:start position:0%
week
 
04:45:18.110 --> 04:45:18.120 align:start position:0%
would you draw up an amendment for me
 
04:45:20.810 --> 04:45:20.820 align:start position:0%
that you would like to see in what's
 
04:45:23.090 --> 04:45:23.100 align:start position:0%
written in my Amendment how you would
 
04:45:27.170 --> 04:45:27.180 align:start position:0%
like to see that corrected for your atcs
 
04:45:30.170 --> 04:45:30.180 align:start position:0%
great good
 
04:45:32.628 --> 04:45:32.638 align:start position:0%
okay I'm I'm certainly willing to look
 
04:45:37.850 --> 04:45:37.860 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:40.368 --> 04:45:40.378 align:start position:0%
asking one person to fix the bill
 
04:45:43.490 --> 04:45:43.500 align:start position:0%
without getting input and I I'm not
 
04:45:45.708 --> 04:45:45.718 align:start position:0%
comfortable with that well you it that
 
04:45:47.690 --> 04:45:47.700 align:start position:0%
believe you me if we get to Wednesday
 
04:45:50.930 --> 04:45:50.940 align:start position:0%
and all the stuff is no no good
 
04:45:53.628 --> 04:45:53.638 align:start position:0%
then we can just retain the bill
 
04:45:55.550 --> 04:45:55.560 align:start position:0%
I guess the issue is going to be whether
 
04:45:58.010 --> 04:45:58.020 align:start position:0%
we go to the floor we or we retain it
 
04:45:59.810 --> 04:45:59.820 align:start position:0%
yeah do you want it do you want to go to
 
04:46:02.390 --> 04:46:02.400 align:start position:0%
the bill which clearly is
 
04:46:06.350 --> 04:46:06.360 align:start position:0%
the the original bill as sponsored is is
 
04:46:09.470 --> 04:46:09.480 align:start position:0%
got just as many enemies
 
04:46:11.810 --> 04:46:11.820 align:start position:0%
against it do you really want to go with
 
04:46:13.850 --> 04:46:13.860 align:start position:0%
that or do you want to hold off and do
 
04:46:14.990 --> 04:46:15.000 align:start position:0%
something I'd like to hear what people
 
04:46:16.788 --> 04:46:16.798 align:start position:0%
in the room want to do okay
 
04:46:19.190 --> 04:46:19.200 align:start position:0%
to her anybody else want to offer up
 
04:46:20.208 --> 04:46:20.218 align:start position:0%
what they think we should do
 
04:46:23.868 --> 04:46:23.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:25.430 --> 04:46:25.440 align:start position:0%
I think we need more time to really
 
04:46:27.350 --> 04:46:27.360 align:start position:0%
digest this I think a public hearing for
 
04:46:29.090 --> 04:46:29.100 align:start position:0%
more than just the amendment might be
 
04:46:31.550 --> 04:46:31.560 align:start position:0%
needed to review it I need more time to
 
04:46:34.610 --> 04:46:34.620 align:start position:0%
go over it and um I did read that I
 
04:46:36.170 --> 04:46:36.180 align:start position:0%
think there were a couple of very valid
 
04:46:38.690 --> 04:46:38.700 align:start position:0%
points on that email I think all of us
 
04:46:40.190 --> 04:46:40.200 align:start position:0%
should have that in front of us so we
 
04:46:41.868 --> 04:46:41.878 align:start position:0%
can evaluate it and really come at this
 
04:46:44.330 --> 04:46:44.340 align:start position:0%
and do it properly I understand what was
 
04:46:46.850 --> 04:46:46.860 align:start position:0%
trying to be done with the Amendments
 
04:46:48.230 --> 04:46:48.240 align:start position:0%
um I
 
04:46:50.448 --> 04:46:50.458 align:start position:0%
I'm not making an opinion one way or the
 
04:46:52.190 --> 04:46:52.200 align:start position:0%
other I just think we need more time to
 
04:46:54.110 --> 04:46:54.120 align:start position:0%
digest this properly I know it's a
 
04:46:56.090 --> 04:46:56.100 align:start position:0%
speedy bill but I think there's a lot of
 
04:46:58.670 --> 04:46:58.680 align:start position:0%
moving parts and dumbing it down is
 
04:47:01.128 --> 04:47:01.138 align:start position:0%
never a bad idea but we need to be very
 
04:47:03.948 --> 04:47:03.958 align:start position:0%
careful about what we're doing
 
04:47:03.958 --> 04:47:06.230 align:start position:0%
careful about what we're doing
good

04:47:06.230 --> 04:47:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:08.448 --> 04:47:08.458 align:start position:0%
this this one is an early bill but we
 
04:47:13.430 --> 04:47:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:13.440 --> 04:47:16.730 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:47:16.730 --> 04:47:16.740 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:18.890 --> 04:47:18.900 align:start position:0%
no you want to pass it
 
04:47:20.690 --> 04:47:20.700 align:start position:0%
well I'd like to have another public
 
04:47:23.510 --> 04:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
hearing on on all the changes or I don't
 
04:47:24.708 --> 04:47:24.718 align:start position:0%
think we have time because the bill that
 
04:47:27.230 --> 04:47:27.240 align:start position:0%
we have we don't have we don't have time
 
04:47:29.868 --> 04:47:29.878 align:start position:0%
for if for 6 39 yeah
 
04:47:31.430 --> 04:47:31.440 align:start position:0%
we don't have time
 
04:47:33.650 --> 04:47:33.660 align:start position:0%
for the other five whatever's what's the
 
04:47:34.910 --> 04:47:34.920 align:start position:0%
other one five
 
04:47:37.010 --> 04:47:37.020 align:start position:0%
forty four five forty four we can
 
04:47:38.930 --> 04:47:38.940 align:start position:0%
absolutely have another public hearing
 
04:47:41.090 --> 04:47:41.100 align:start position:0%
on another on its own if we were to do
 
04:47:42.410 --> 04:47:42.420 align:start position:0%
Amendment for that
 
04:47:44.868 --> 04:47:44.878 align:start position:0%
but 639 has to be out of this committee
 
04:47:50.628 --> 04:47:50.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:55.430 --> 04:47:55.440 align:start position:0%
and just keep 639 uh in advance yes uh
 
04:47:57.050 --> 04:47:57.060 align:start position:0%
first of all um we don't have to have a
 
04:47:58.310 --> 04:47:58.320 align:start position:0%
public hearing for you to invite people
 
04:48:01.190 --> 04:48:01.200 align:start position:0%
to speak correct that is true okay also
 
04:48:03.230 --> 04:48:03.240 align:start position:0%
if if we do anything to that other bill
 
04:48:04.970 --> 04:48:04.980 align:start position:0%
that adds money onto it it becomes an
 
04:48:05.948 --> 04:48:05.958 align:start position:0%
early bill
 
04:48:09.050 --> 04:48:09.060 align:start position:0%
right so it it has the same reporting
 
04:48:09.060 --> 04:48:10.670 align:start position:0%
right so it it has the same reporting
deadlines

04:48:10.670 --> 04:48:10.680 align:start position:0%
deadlines
 
04:48:10.680 --> 04:48:12.110 align:start position:0%
deadlines
so

04:48:12.110 --> 04:48:12.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:48:14.690 --> 04:48:14.700 align:start position:0%
so it's either past something next week
 
04:48:17.510 --> 04:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
or hold it off until next year I will
 
04:48:19.730 --> 04:48:19.740 align:start position:0%
point out to all of you that uh you know
 
04:48:21.288 --> 04:48:21.298 align:start position:0%
next year is an election year maybe you
 
04:48:23.090 --> 04:48:23.100 align:start position:0%
might want to have this vote
 
04:48:25.430 --> 04:48:25.440 align:start position:0%
in an election year as opposed to first
 
04:48:26.708 --> 04:48:26.718 align:start position:0%
year I don't know
 
04:48:29.030 --> 04:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
anybody out in the audience want to come
 
04:48:30.890 --> 04:48:30.900 align:start position:0%
in and sort of explain why we should
 
04:48:33.170 --> 04:48:33.180 align:start position:0%
move forward with 639 in its current
 
04:48:35.030 --> 04:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
form is anybody here for 639 in its
 
04:48:41.448 --> 04:48:41.458 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:41.458 --> 04:48:49.070 align:start position:0%
 
great

04:48:49.070 --> 04:48:49.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:51.110 --> 04:48:51.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity Matt Simon
 
04:48:53.570 --> 04:48:53.580 align:start position:0%
I work for Prime ATC formally of the
 
04:48:56.208 --> 04:48:56.218 align:start position:0%
marijuana policy project and again I
 
04:48:58.910 --> 04:48:58.920 align:start position:0%
don't speak for the whole Coalition I
 
04:49:01.128 --> 04:49:01.138 align:start position:0%
will say first of all the idea of the
 
04:49:03.530 --> 04:49:03.540 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission being the regulator is
 
04:49:05.208 --> 04:49:05.218 align:start position:0%
not my preference I don't think it was
 
04:49:07.970 --> 04:49:07.980 align:start position:0%
any of our first choices that alone is
 
04:49:09.830 --> 04:49:09.840 align:start position:0%
not something the Coalition views as a
 
04:49:12.410 --> 04:49:12.420 align:start position:0%
deal breaker that's been confirmed via
 
04:49:14.868 --> 04:49:14.878 align:start position:0%
email today all of us have said that
 
04:49:16.970 --> 04:49:16.980 align:start position:0%
alone is not a deal breaker what we have
 
04:49:18.948 --> 04:49:18.958 align:start position:0%
said is that if the if Liquor Commission
 
04:49:21.230 --> 04:49:21.240 align:start position:0%
is going to be the regulator that there
 
04:49:24.288 --> 04:49:24.298 align:start position:0%
needs to be more statutory guidance and
 
04:49:25.970 --> 04:49:25.980 align:start position:0%
there needs to be some kind of
 
04:49:27.890 --> 04:49:27.900 align:start position:0%
independent oversight and transparency
 
04:49:30.650 --> 04:49:30.660 align:start position:0%
into the process having rules approved
 
04:49:34.010 --> 04:49:34.020 align:start position:0%
by gel car is one step of that but we
 
04:49:35.270 --> 04:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
think the independent advisory
 
04:49:37.310 --> 04:49:37.320 align:start position:0%
commission that was in the original bill
 
04:49:39.230 --> 04:49:39.240 align:start position:0%
should be retained that that would
 
04:49:41.208 --> 04:49:41.218 align:start position:0%
provide the kind of transparency we're
 
04:49:43.128 --> 04:49:43.138 align:start position:0%
talking about it's an awesome
 
04:49:44.868 --> 04:49:44.878 align:start position:0%
responsibility and a one-time
 
04:49:48.110 --> 04:49:48.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity to try to transition from a
 
04:49:50.270 --> 04:49:50.280 align:start position:0%
Prohibition Market to a regulated market
 
04:49:52.490 --> 04:49:52.500 align:start position:0%
we think it's really important to do
 
04:49:54.230 --> 04:49:54.240 align:start position:0%
that in an atmosphere where people
 
04:49:57.110 --> 04:49:57.120 align:start position:0%
understand what's going on and
 
04:49:59.330 --> 04:49:59.340 align:start position:0%
understand in particular that cannabis
 
04:50:01.670 --> 04:50:01.680 align:start position:0%
is not liquor that is a fundamentally
 
04:50:04.190 --> 04:50:04.200 align:start position:0%
different product in many ways first of
 
04:50:07.128 --> 04:50:07.138 align:start position:0%
all it's a Botanical product that goes
 
04:50:09.350 --> 04:50:09.360 align:start position:0%
bad after a certain time so freshness
 
04:50:12.770 --> 04:50:12.780 align:start position:0%
matters and consumers are interested in
 
04:50:16.368 --> 04:50:16.378 align:start position:0%
some different things than a bottle on a
 
04:50:18.650 --> 04:50:18.660 align:start position:0%
shelf there's another key difference
 
04:50:20.150 --> 04:50:20.160 align:start position:0%
which is that
 
04:50:22.070 --> 04:50:22.080 align:start position:0%
a lot of people enjoy alcohol but I've
 
04:50:23.868 --> 04:50:23.878 align:start position:0%
never had somebody tell me you know what
 
04:50:27.288 --> 04:50:27.298 align:start position:0%
my wife was really screwed up I didn't
 
04:50:29.510 --> 04:50:29.520 align:start position:0%
know if I wanted to go on living until I
 
04:50:32.570 --> 04:50:32.580 align:start position:0%
found Bourbon and bourbon really changed
 
04:50:34.430 --> 04:50:34.440 align:start position:0%
my life and made me want to live again
 
04:50:37.128 --> 04:50:37.138 align:start position:0%
and I feel I can be a better father to
 
04:50:39.530 --> 04:50:39.540 align:start position:0%
my kids Etc blah blah blah I've never
 
04:50:41.930 --> 04:50:41.940 align:start position:0%
heard that about alcohol I work at a
 
04:50:43.430 --> 04:50:43.440 align:start position:0%
cannabis dispensary and I hear that from
 
04:50:46.490 --> 04:50:46.500 align:start position:0%
patients on a regular basis so for that
 
04:50:49.070 --> 04:50:49.080 align:start position:0%
reason I think the service we provide to
 
04:50:51.050 --> 04:50:51.060 align:start position:0%
14 000 patients in the state is
 
04:50:54.110 --> 04:50:54.120 align:start position:0%
incredibly important we don't treat them
 
04:50:56.208 --> 04:50:56.218 align:start position:0%
like somebody who's here to buy a bottle
 
04:50:59.628 --> 04:50:59.638 align:start position:0%
of bourbon we ask them what they know
 
04:51:01.490 --> 04:51:01.500 align:start position:0%
about cannabis and we meet them where
 
04:51:03.470 --> 04:51:03.480 align:start position:0%
they are if they know nothing we teach
 
04:51:05.570 --> 04:51:05.580 align:start position:0%
them we're trying to help create a
 
04:51:08.150 --> 04:51:08.160 align:start position:0%
culture of responsible use around this
 
04:51:10.850 --> 04:51:10.860 align:start position:0%
product and we do not trust that simply
 
04:51:12.590 --> 04:51:12.600 align:start position:0%
putting it into the liquor model is
 
04:51:15.948 --> 04:51:15.958 align:start position:0%
going to achieve that result so we think
 
04:51:17.570 --> 04:51:17.580 align:start position:0%
the therapeutic cannabis program is very
 
04:51:19.490 --> 04:51:19.500 align:start position:0%
important I'd ask that you hear from the
 
04:51:21.070 --> 04:51:21.080 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and and services
 
04:51:26.930 --> 04:51:26.940 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:28.788 --> 04:51:28.798 align:start position:0%
I guess that's what I'd say from the
 
04:51:30.410 --> 04:51:30.420 align:start position:0%
coalition's perspective if this is a
 
04:51:32.570 --> 04:51:32.580 align:start position:0%
policy conversation of how to do this in
 
04:51:33.770 --> 04:51:33.780 align:start position:0%
a way that works under the WIC
 
04:51:37.010 --> 04:51:37.020 align:start position:0%
commission will participate in that and
 
04:51:39.170 --> 04:51:39.180 align:start position:0%
if it's rushing something that does not
 
04:51:40.910 --> 04:51:40.920 align:start position:0%
give them oversight and transparency
 
04:51:42.708 --> 04:51:42.718 align:start position:0%
then that's going to be much more
 
04:51:42.718 --> 04:51:43.970 align:start position:0%
then that's going to be much more
problematic

04:51:43.970 --> 04:51:43.980 align:start position:0%
problematic
 
04:51:46.368 --> 04:51:46.378 align:start position:0%
I'll also comment just From primeatc's
 
04:51:49.310 --> 04:51:49.320 align:start position:0%
perspective on the the for-profit piece
 
04:51:50.930 --> 04:51:50.940 align:start position:0%
we've actually been neutral on that
 
04:51:52.970 --> 04:51:52.980 align:start position:0%
throughout primes never taken a position
 
04:51:55.190 --> 04:51:55.200 align:start position:0%
one way or the other on that
 
04:51:57.530 --> 04:51:57.540 align:start position:0%
but our position within the context of
 
04:51:59.030 --> 04:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
transitioning to an adult use Market
 
04:52:01.788 --> 04:52:01.798 align:start position:0%
this is a bill that is going to allow
 
04:52:03.708 --> 04:52:03.718 align:start position:0%
for-profit businesses to come to New
 
04:52:06.170 --> 04:52:06.180 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and make lots of money and in
 
04:52:08.930 --> 04:52:08.940 align:start position:0%
that context to tell the atcs who have
 
04:52:10.850 --> 04:52:10.860 align:start position:0%
for the last six years been complying
 
04:52:13.610 --> 04:52:13.620 align:start position:0%
with every Rule and Regulation and have
 
04:52:15.530 --> 04:52:15.540 align:start position:0%
resulted in no negative headlines no
 
04:52:17.628 --> 04:52:17.638 align:start position:0%
problems that I've heard about to tell
 
04:52:19.670 --> 04:52:19.680 align:start position:0%
them that they have to remain non-profit
 
04:52:22.128 --> 04:52:22.138 align:start position:0%
while big companies are coming in and
 
04:52:24.590 --> 04:52:24.600 align:start position:0%
operating on a for-profit basis we think
 
04:52:27.050 --> 04:52:27.060 align:start position:0%
that's fundamentally unfair and and a
 
04:52:29.510 --> 04:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
big problem if the amendment were to go
 
04:52:30.948 --> 04:52:30.958 align:start position:0%
into effect is written we think that
 
04:52:32.690 --> 04:52:32.700 align:start position:0%
would destroy the therapeutic cannabis
 
04:52:35.570 --> 04:52:35.580 align:start position:0%
program it would incentivize the atcs to
 
04:52:37.368 --> 04:52:37.378 align:start position:0%
create separate for-profit businesses
 
04:52:39.530 --> 04:52:39.540 align:start position:0%
and pursue for-profit licenses they
 
04:52:41.750 --> 04:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
would have no reason to continue serving
 
04:52:44.448 --> 04:52:44.458 align:start position:0%
patients if they did so they would be
 
04:52:45.890 --> 04:52:45.900 align:start position:0%
putting themselves into difficult
 
04:52:48.830 --> 04:52:48.840 align:start position:0%
financial position and the state would
 
04:52:51.110 --> 04:52:51.120 align:start position:0%
be selling tax-free cannabis so usually
 
04:52:54.590 --> 04:52:54.600 align:start position:0%
what keeps a medical cannabis program
 
04:52:56.868 --> 04:52:56.878 align:start position:0%
functioning and in every state that's
 
04:52:59.330 --> 04:52:59.340 align:start position:0%
done this but one they have maintained a
 
04:53:01.128 --> 04:53:01.138 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program that
 
04:53:02.750 --> 04:53:02.760 align:start position:0%
continues to serve patients it's
 
04:53:05.030 --> 04:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
important for a few reasons one is that
 
04:53:06.230 --> 04:53:06.240 align:start position:0%
adult use
 
04:53:08.030 --> 04:53:08.040 align:start position:0%
it's only 21 and older we have
 
04:53:10.010 --> 04:53:10.020 align:start position:0%
registered patients who are under 21 so
 
04:53:12.400 --> 04:53:12.410 align:start position:0%
somebody needs to continue serving them
 
04:53:12.410 --> 04:53:13.788 align:start position:0%
somebody needs to continue serving them
[Music]

04:53:13.788 --> 04:53:13.798 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:53:16.730 --> 04:53:16.740 align:start position:0%
usually it's a tax-free situation for
 
04:53:19.310 --> 04:53:19.320 align:start position:0%
registered patients whereas adult use
 
04:53:21.708 --> 04:53:21.718 align:start position:0%
consumers have to pay the tax so that
 
04:53:23.628 --> 04:53:23.638 align:start position:0%
incentivize patients to to remain
 
04:53:23.638 --> 04:53:24.890 align:start position:0%
incentivize patients to to remain
registered

04:53:24.890 --> 04:53:24.900 align:start position:0%
registered
 
04:53:28.430 --> 04:53:28.440 align:start position:0%
and patients usually have access to a
 
04:53:31.368 --> 04:53:31.378 align:start position:0%
broader range of products and potencies
 
04:53:34.128 --> 04:53:34.138 align:start position:0%
than adult use consumers for example
 
04:53:36.350 --> 04:53:36.360 align:start position:0%
Edibles are usually limited to five
 
04:53:38.930 --> 04:53:38.940 align:start position:0%
milligrams per per unit in an adult use
 
04:53:41.990 --> 04:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
Market patients often use much higher
 
04:53:43.490 --> 04:53:43.500 align:start position:0%
Doses and have been using for much
 
04:53:45.890 --> 04:53:45.900 align:start position:0%
longer period of time so they have
 
04:53:50.030 --> 04:53:50.040 align:start position:0%
access to a broader range of products so
 
04:53:52.670 --> 04:53:52.680 align:start position:0%
the education we provide to patients the
 
04:53:55.070 --> 04:53:55.080 align:start position:0%
ongoing counseling we provide
 
04:53:57.410 --> 04:53:57.420 align:start position:0%
the products we provide that will not be
 
04:53:59.470 --> 04:53:59.480 align:start position:0%
viable in adult use market for example
 
04:54:01.610 --> 04:54:01.620 align:start position:0%
suppositories are not something you're
 
04:54:03.230 --> 04:54:03.240 align:start position:0%
going to see in an adult use Market but
 
04:54:04.970 --> 04:54:04.980 align:start position:0%
we have those
 
04:54:04.980 --> 04:54:05.750 align:start position:0%
we have those
um

04:54:05.750 --> 04:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:54:07.788 --> 04:54:07.798 align:start position:0%
so for a number of reasons we think the
 
04:54:09.110 --> 04:54:09.120 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program is really
 
04:54:11.150 --> 04:54:11.160 align:start position:0%
important and needs to be maintained and
 
04:54:12.470 --> 04:54:12.480 align:start position:0%
we're happy to talk about all the rest
 
04:54:13.970 --> 04:54:13.980 align:start position:0%
if we're talking about how to make good
 
04:54:13.980 --> 04:54:16.010 align:start position:0%
if we're talking about how to make good
policy

04:54:16.010 --> 04:54:16.020 align:start position:0%
policy
 
04:54:19.670 --> 04:54:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:19.680 --> 04:54:21.830 align:start position:0%
 
buddy

04:54:21.830 --> 04:54:21.840 align:start position:0%
buddy
 
04:54:21.840 --> 04:54:23.530 align:start position:0%
buddy
yes

04:54:23.530 --> 04:54:23.540 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:54:26.510 --> 04:54:26.520 align:start position:0%
thanks for uh speaking to us so you've
 
04:54:27.948 --> 04:54:27.958 align:start position:0%
thought about this more than probably
 
04:54:30.050 --> 04:54:30.060 align:start position:0%
the majority of us on this committee
 
04:54:30.060 --> 04:54:31.250 align:start position:0%
the majority of us on this committee
anyways

04:54:31.250 --> 04:54:31.260 align:start position:0%
anyways
 
04:54:32.930 --> 04:54:32.940 align:start position:0%
as you see you need a few things were
 
04:54:34.070 --> 04:54:34.080 align:start position:0%
there things in here that you think
 
04:54:35.810 --> 04:54:35.820 align:start position:0%
should be a must-have that have been
 
04:54:37.070 --> 04:54:37.080 align:start position:0%
omitted in the amendment and we're
 
04:54:38.270 --> 04:54:38.280 align:start position:0%
talking about changing the amendment
 
04:54:40.430 --> 04:54:40.440 align:start position:0%
what things do you think we should make
 
04:54:45.288 --> 04:54:45.298 align:start position:0%
sure is not excluded or is now
 
04:54:47.690 --> 04:54:47.700 align:start position:0%
you know retained from the original bill
 
04:54:50.330 --> 04:54:50.340 align:start position:0%
yeah number one for me is we spent a lot
 
04:54:51.830 --> 04:54:51.840 align:start position:0%
of time crafting a thoughtful
 
04:54:54.050 --> 04:54:54.060 align:start position:0%
deliberative transition for the
 
04:54:56.030 --> 04:54:56.040 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program in a way
 
04:54:58.250 --> 04:54:58.260 align:start position:0%
that made sense for everybody that
 
04:55:00.770 --> 04:55:00.780 align:start position:0%
wouldn't leave patients behind the atcs
 
04:55:02.208 --> 04:55:02.218 align:start position:0%
were not asking for any special
 
04:55:04.730 --> 04:55:04.740 align:start position:0%
treatment we just wanted a viable path
 
04:55:04.740 --> 04:55:05.810 align:start position:0%
treatment we just wanted a viable path
forward

04:55:05.810 --> 04:55:05.820 align:start position:0%
forward
 
04:55:08.208 --> 04:55:08.218 align:start position:0%
so what we did in the original bill was
 
04:55:11.030 --> 04:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
the atcs would be able to convert to
 
04:55:13.190 --> 04:55:13.200 align:start position:0%
for-profit they would be able to get a
 
04:55:14.930 --> 04:55:14.940 align:start position:0%
retail license there would be
 
04:55:16.670 --> 04:55:16.680 align:start position:0%
requirements that they continue serving
 
04:55:18.410 --> 04:55:18.420 align:start position:0%
patients that they not Jack up prices
 
04:55:20.570 --> 04:55:20.580 align:start position:0%
that they continue to to do what they're
 
04:55:23.090 --> 04:55:23.100 align:start position:0%
doing it would also expand access for
 
04:55:25.368 --> 04:55:25.378 align:start position:0%
patients and opportunities for adult use
 
04:55:26.810 --> 04:55:26.820 align:start position:0%
businesses because the adult use
 
04:55:29.570 --> 04:55:29.580 align:start position:0%
businesses would be able to apply for a
 
04:55:32.448 --> 04:55:32.458 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis endorsement so if a
 
04:55:34.190 --> 04:55:34.200 align:start position:0%
retailer wants to sell to patients
 
04:55:34.200 --> 04:55:35.270 align:start position:0%
retailer wants to sell to patients
tax-free

04:55:35.270 --> 04:55:35.280 align:start position:0%
tax-free
 
04:55:37.070 --> 04:55:37.080 align:start position:0%
they have to meet the standards that are
 
04:55:38.330 --> 04:55:38.340 align:start position:0%
established by the Department of Health
 
04:55:40.550 --> 04:55:40.560 align:start position:0%
and Human Services for the atcs and if
 
04:55:43.250 --> 04:55:43.260 align:start position:0%
they choose to do that they can that's a
 
04:55:44.690 --> 04:55:44.700 align:start position:0%
model borrowed from Washington state
 
04:55:46.670 --> 04:55:46.680 align:start position:0%
that we thought made a lot of sense for
 
04:55:47.750 --> 04:55:47.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
04:55:47.760 --> 04:55:49.330 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
and

04:55:49.330 --> 04:55:49.340 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:55:52.190 --> 04:55:52.200 align:start position:0%
if we don't expand access for patients
 
04:55:53.810 --> 04:55:53.820 align:start position:0%
patients will only have seven
 
04:55:55.970 --> 04:55:55.980 align:start position:0%
dispensaries that they can shop at but
 
04:55:58.550 --> 04:55:58.560 align:start position:0%
adults will have potentially a much
 
04:56:01.190 --> 04:56:01.200 align:start position:0%
larger number of stores so we want to
 
04:56:03.410 --> 04:56:03.420 align:start position:0%
expand access for adults and patients we
 
04:56:04.850 --> 04:56:04.860 align:start position:0%
want to expand business opportunities
 
04:56:08.030 --> 04:56:08.040 align:start position:0%
for both the atcs and everybody else and
 
04:56:09.948 --> 04:56:09.958 align:start position:0%
do it in a way that makes sense I think
 
04:56:12.050 --> 04:56:12.060 align:start position:0%
the original Bill does that I'm not
 
04:56:13.430 --> 04:56:13.440 align:start position:0%
entirely sure how that works with the
 
04:56:14.810 --> 04:56:14.820 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission I'd be interested in
 
04:56:16.190 --> 04:56:16.200 align:start position:0%
hearing the Department of Health and
 
04:56:20.270 --> 04:56:20.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:22.310 --> 04:56:22.320 align:start position:0%
well the way I was treating it was that
 
04:56:24.708 --> 04:56:24.718 align:start position:0%
you would just continue as you are now
 
04:56:26.390 --> 04:56:26.400 align:start position:0%
nothing would change
 
04:56:29.750 --> 04:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
if we continue as we are now and adult
 
04:56:31.788 --> 04:56:31.798 align:start position:0%
use stores regulated by the state open
 
04:56:34.910 --> 04:56:34.920 align:start position:0%
up and serve patients tax-free they will
 
04:56:37.368 --> 04:56:37.378 align:start position:0%
be competing directly with us as
 
04:56:39.770 --> 04:56:39.780 align:start position:0%
for-profits they have access to Capital
 
04:56:41.750 --> 04:56:41.760 align:start position:0%
that we don't have they'll be able to
 
04:56:44.390 --> 04:56:44.400 align:start position:0%
build massive cultivation facilities
 
04:56:46.430 --> 04:56:46.440 align:start position:0%
they'll be able to poach our staff
 
04:56:48.410 --> 04:56:48.420 align:start position:0%
members they'll be able to destroy us
 
04:56:51.350 --> 04:56:51.360 align:start position:0%
and and so they will be able to sell
 
04:56:53.708 --> 04:56:53.718 align:start position:0%
marijuana cheaper than you
 
04:56:56.750 --> 04:56:56.760 align:start position:0%
uh I I believe they would if if they've
 
04:56:58.610 --> 04:56:58.620 align:start position:0%
chosen that the whole point of the
 
04:57:01.128 --> 04:57:01.138 align:start position:0%
non-profit was that you guys were never
 
04:57:03.948 --> 04:57:03.958 align:start position:0%
that that you're going to keep your your
 
04:57:06.650 --> 04:57:06.660 align:start position:0%
marijuana cheapest I believe the point
 
04:57:08.448 --> 04:57:08.458 align:start position:0%
of the non-profit status was to make
 
04:57:10.368 --> 04:57:10.378 align:start position:0%
legislators feel comfortable with the
 
04:57:12.230 --> 04:57:12.240 align:start position:0%
original Bill a number of States
 
04:57:14.990 --> 04:57:15.000 align:start position:0%
originally required dispensaries to be
 
04:57:17.090 --> 04:57:17.100 align:start position:0%
non-profit I'm not aware of any that
 
04:57:20.868 --> 04:57:20.878 align:start position:0%
still do uh what really happens in each
 
04:57:23.390 --> 04:57:23.400 align:start position:0%
case each of the nonprofits had to seek
 
04:57:25.788 --> 04:57:25.798 align:start position:0%
outside funding and interact with large
 
04:57:27.650 --> 04:57:27.660 align:start position:0%
organizations just to be able to
 
04:57:29.208 --> 04:57:29.218 align:start position:0%
complete their build out and and get
 
04:57:31.368 --> 04:57:31.378 align:start position:0%
into business so
 
04:57:31.378 --> 04:57:32.208 align:start position:0%
into business so
um

04:57:32.208 --> 04:57:32.218 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:57:35.990 --> 04:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
it's complicated but non-profit status
 
04:57:39.470 --> 04:57:39.480 align:start position:0%
did not create the best opportunities
 
04:57:41.868 --> 04:57:41.878 align:start position:0%
for this business and it's become clear
 
04:57:41.878 --> 04:57:42.948 align:start position:0%
for this business and it's become clear
so

04:57:42.948 --> 04:57:42.958 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:57:45.530 --> 04:57:45.540 align:start position:0%
this is just a fairness issue for us and
 
04:57:48.470 --> 04:57:48.480 align:start position:0%
uh the reality is a large company I'll
 
04:57:49.970 --> 04:57:49.980 align:start position:0%
give you an example in Maine a very
 
04:57:52.490 --> 04:57:52.500 align:start position:0%
large company has moved into Maine and
 
04:57:54.230 --> 04:57:54.240 align:start position:0%
they're publicly funded and they have
 
04:57:56.150 --> 04:57:56.160 align:start position:0%
very Deep Pockets so they're able to
 
04:57:59.628 --> 04:57:59.638 align:start position:0%
sell 75 ounces of cannabis in an attempt
 
04:58:01.970 --> 04:58:01.980 align:start position:0%
to put as many other businesses out of
 
04:58:04.550 --> 04:58:04.560 align:start position:0%
out of business as they possibly can
 
04:58:07.788 --> 04:58:07.798 align:start position:0%
so there are large companies there is
 
04:58:09.470 --> 04:58:09.480 align:start position:0%
Big cannabis and they do want to come to
 
04:58:11.750 --> 04:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and
 
04:58:13.128 --> 04:58:13.138 align:start position:0%
when I was working on this issue in
 
04:58:15.890 --> 04:58:15.900 align:start position:0%
Vermont we often heard legislators frame
 
04:58:17.868 --> 04:58:17.878 align:start position:0%
it as do we want to create the Budweiser
 
04:58:19.850 --> 04:58:19.860 align:start position:0%
of cannabis or do we want to create the
 
04:58:21.530 --> 04:58:21.540 align:start position:0%
heady topper of cannabis do we want
 
04:58:24.110 --> 04:58:24.120 align:start position:0%
there to be small craft businesses that
 
04:58:26.990 --> 04:58:27.000 align:start position:0%
are focused on quality that
 
04:58:29.330 --> 04:58:29.340 align:start position:0%
live by New Hampshire values or do we
 
04:58:30.650 --> 04:58:30.660 align:start position:0%
want to open it up to a bunch of big
 
04:58:32.868 --> 04:58:32.878 align:start position:0%
companies to come in and run everything
 
04:58:34.730 --> 04:58:34.740 align:start position:0%
I think that's an important fundamental
 
04:58:40.910 --> 04:58:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:43.490 --> 04:58:43.500 align:start position:0%
I I don't know how you control that
 
04:58:46.010 --> 04:58:46.020 align:start position:0%
I mean I mean unless you want to say
 
04:58:47.750 --> 04:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
that you can only do so much about a
 
04:58:47.760 --> 04:58:48.948 align:start position:0%
that you can only do so much about a
business

04:58:48.948 --> 04:58:48.958 align:start position:0%
business
 
04:58:50.930 --> 04:58:50.940 align:start position:0%
that you're going to the legislation
 
04:58:54.170 --> 04:58:54.180 align:start position:0%
would say you can only you have a
 
04:58:55.550 --> 04:58:55.560 align:start position:0%
certain maximum amount of amount of
 
04:58:57.830 --> 04:58:57.840 align:start position:0%
volume they can do yeah well that's a
 
04:59:00.708 --> 04:59:00.718 align:start position:0%
policy choice so in Massachusetts each
 
04:59:02.868 --> 04:59:02.878 align:start position:0%
business can have up to three licenses
 
04:59:05.930 --> 04:59:05.940 align:start position:0%
of each type in Vermont they were so
 
04:59:07.610 --> 04:59:07.620 align:start position:0%
interested in keeping big marijuana out
 
04:59:09.708 --> 04:59:09.718 align:start position:0%
that they limited it to one license of
 
04:59:13.070 --> 04:59:13.080 align:start position:0%
each type so a big company can have one
 
04:59:15.770 --> 04:59:15.780 align:start position:0%
cultivation one manufacturing One retail
 
04:59:17.208 --> 04:59:17.218 align:start position:0%
but you better make it a good retail
 
04:59:18.350 --> 04:59:18.360 align:start position:0%
because it's the only only one you're
 
04:59:21.110 --> 04:59:21.120 align:start position:0%
going to have they also set sizes for
 
04:59:23.868 --> 04:59:23.878 align:start position:0%
the for the cultivation tiers and they
 
04:59:25.970 --> 04:59:25.980 align:start position:0%
did not license any very large
 
04:59:28.368 --> 04:59:28.378 align:start position:0%
cultivators they licensed a lot of small
 
04:59:30.530 --> 04:59:30.540 align:start position:0%
cultivators and some medium-sized
 
04:59:30.540 --> 04:59:32.030 align:start position:0%
cultivators and some medium-sized
cultivators

04:59:32.030 --> 04:59:32.040 align:start position:0%
cultivators
 
04:59:34.930 --> 04:59:34.940 align:start position:0%
there will be no big cannabis in Vermont
 
04:59:37.430 --> 04:59:37.440 align:start position:0%
until and I think this is a very
 
04:59:38.810 --> 04:59:38.820 align:start position:0%
important Point too and I'm sorry I
 
04:59:40.490 --> 04:59:40.500 align:start position:0%
didn't mention it until now
 
04:59:42.410 --> 04:59:42.420 align:start position:0%
interstate commerce is going to change
 
04:59:44.570 --> 04:59:44.580 align:start position:0%
this picture completely
 
04:59:45.890 --> 04:59:45.900 align:start position:0%
and there have been a number of court
 
04:59:48.170 --> 04:59:48.180 align:start position:0%
rulings in other states already that
 
04:59:51.530 --> 04:59:51.540 align:start position:0%
suggest that these siled state-by-state
 
04:59:54.050 --> 04:59:54.060 align:start position:0%
markets are likely to become a thing of
 
04:59:55.610 --> 04:59:55.620 align:start position:0%
the past pretty soon
 
04:59:57.350 --> 04:59:57.360 align:start position:0%
Congress probably isn't going to do
 
04:59:59.810 --> 04:59:59.820 align:start position:0%
anything but a court May strike down
 
05:00:01.610 --> 05:00:01.620 align:start position:0%
prohibitions on interstate commerce
 
05:00:04.010 --> 05:00:04.020 align:start position:0%
which would mean that whoever gets to do
 
05:00:06.110 --> 05:00:06.120 align:start position:0%
retail in New Hampshire is going to be
 
05:00:08.570 --> 05:00:08.580 align:start position:0%
who makes the money cultivation of
 
05:00:10.490 --> 05:00:10.500 align:start position:0%
cannabis in New Hampshire is not going
 
05:00:14.150 --> 05:00:14.160 align:start position:0%
to be a very viable business after
 
05:00:16.610 --> 05:00:16.620 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire retailers can order from
 
05:00:19.368 --> 05:00:19.378 align:start position:0%
you know California and places like that
 
05:00:21.890 --> 05:00:21.900 align:start position:0%
the Liquor Commission succeeds in its
 
05:00:23.390 --> 05:00:23.400 align:start position:0%
liquor model because they're able to
 
05:00:25.910 --> 05:00:25.920 align:start position:0%
create stores that have everything you
 
05:00:27.890 --> 05:00:27.900 align:start position:0%
could possibly want at prices that are
 
05:00:29.270 --> 05:00:29.280 align:start position:0%
competitive if not better than
 
05:00:31.850 --> 05:00:31.860 align:start position:0%
everywhere else and
 
05:00:33.770 --> 05:00:33.780 align:start position:0%
if everything has to come from New
 
05:00:33.780 --> 05:00:35.208 align:start position:0%
if everything has to come from New
Hampshire

05:00:35.208 --> 05:00:35.218 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
05:00:36.770 --> 05:00:36.780 align:start position:0%
that's only the first phase of the
 
05:00:37.970 --> 05:00:37.980 align:start position:0%
market we don't know whether it'll be
 
05:00:40.430 --> 05:00:40.440 align:start position:0%
one year three years or ten years but at
 
05:00:41.868 --> 05:00:41.878 align:start position:0%
some point interstate commerce is going
 
05:00:44.330 --> 05:00:44.340 align:start position:0%
to happen and if for example the atcs
 
05:00:46.310 --> 05:00:46.320 align:start position:0%
can only be cultivators well that's
 
05:00:48.410 --> 05:00:48.420 align:start position:0%
that's just not going to be a viable
 
05:00:51.650 --> 05:00:51.660 align:start position:0%
business in the future in all likelihood
 
05:00:51.660 --> 05:00:53.030 align:start position:0%
business in the future in all likelihood
so

05:00:53.030 --> 05:00:53.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:00:55.250 --> 05:00:55.260 align:start position:0%
you just made a great case for us not to
 
05:00:58.128 --> 05:00:58.138 align:start position:0%
do anything and wait until until the
 
05:00:59.930 --> 05:00:59.940 align:start position:0%
Interstate Commerce Act
 
05:01:03.470 --> 05:01:03.480 align:start position:0%
is is fixed and at that point then we
 
05:01:07.670 --> 05:01:07.680 align:start position:0%
can open up our state liquor model and
 
05:01:10.730 --> 05:01:10.740 align:start position:0%
make shitload of money
 
05:01:12.708 --> 05:01:12.718 align:start position:0%
that's a policy choice I think we wrote
 
05:01:15.288 --> 05:01:15.298 align:start position:0%
HP 639 with the idea that we wanted to
 
05:01:17.750 --> 05:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
anticipate those potential changes and
 
05:01:17.760 --> 05:01:18.770 align:start position:0%
anticipate those potential changes and
set

05:01:18.770 --> 05:01:18.780 align:start position:0%
set
 
05:01:21.110 --> 05:01:21.120 align:start position:0%
all these businesses up and the state up
 
05:01:23.448 --> 05:01:23.458 align:start position:0%
for potential success while also
 
05:01:25.550 --> 05:01:25.560 align:start position:0%
minimizing any harms associated with
 
05:01:28.910 --> 05:01:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:33.410 --> 05:01:33.420 align:start position:0%
well how so how did you protect how did
 
05:01:34.670 --> 05:01:34.680 align:start position:0%
we protect Public Safety in public
 
05:01:36.708 --> 05:01:36.718 align:start position:0%
health yeah well by requiring
 
05:01:38.690 --> 05:01:38.700 align:start position:0%
independent lab testing for products
 
05:01:40.490 --> 05:01:40.500 align:start position:0%
that was in the draft we created it's
 
05:01:42.530 --> 05:01:42.540 align:start position:0%
not actually in the introduced bill but
 
05:01:44.948 --> 05:01:44.958 align:start position:0%
we think that's an absolute must add
 
05:01:47.090 --> 05:01:47.100 align:start position:0%
there will be no confidence in the
 
05:01:48.830 --> 05:01:48.840 align:start position:0%
testing regime if companies are allowed
 
05:01:50.270 --> 05:01:50.280 align:start position:0%
to test their own cannabis and put
 
05:01:52.970 --> 05:01:52.980 align:start position:0%
whatever numbers they want on the labels
 
05:01:55.550 --> 05:01:55.560 align:start position:0%
um but the the original Bill include
 
05:01:57.650 --> 05:01:57.660 align:start position:0%
statutory language directing the
 
05:01:59.208 --> 05:01:59.218 align:start position:0%
Cannabis commission to come up with
 
05:02:01.788 --> 05:02:01.798 align:start position:0%
rules that prioritize public health and
 
05:02:04.368 --> 05:02:04.378 align:start position:0%
safety labeling not having products that
 
05:02:06.288 --> 05:02:06.298 align:start position:0%
appeal to Children things like that
 
05:02:08.690 --> 05:02:08.700 align:start position:0%
restricting advertising
 
05:02:08.700 --> 05:02:09.410 align:start position:0%
restricting advertising
um

05:02:09.410 --> 05:02:09.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:02:11.150 --> 05:02:11.160 align:start position:0%
there's quite a bit in in the original
 
05:02:13.910 --> 05:02:13.920 align:start position:0%
Bill I know it is over 40 pages I'll
 
05:02:15.410 --> 05:02:15.420 align:start position:0%
just point out the Illinois Bill that
 
05:02:17.570 --> 05:02:17.580 align:start position:0%
legalized cannabis was 600 and some
 
05:02:19.670 --> 05:02:19.680 align:start position:0%
pages the bill that implemented adult
 
05:02:22.010 --> 05:02:22.020 align:start position:0%
use regulated markets in Vermont was
 
05:02:24.410 --> 05:02:24.420 align:start position:0%
over 100 Pages I've actually never seen
 
05:02:26.510 --> 05:02:26.520 align:start position:0%
a cannabis legalization bill as short as
 
05:02:30.050 --> 05:02:30.060 align:start position:0%
HB 639 so I understand the preference
 
05:02:32.810 --> 05:02:32.820 align:start position:0%
for shorter legislation but there are a
 
05:02:35.448 --> 05:02:35.458 align:start position:0%
lot of moving Parts here and uh it's
 
05:02:37.550 --> 05:02:37.560 align:start position:0%
okay to take one or two things out and
 
05:02:39.470 --> 05:02:39.480 align:start position:0%
maybe address them in separate bills but
 
05:02:39.480 --> 05:02:40.490 align:start position:0%
maybe address them in separate bills but
uh

05:02:40.490 --> 05:02:40.500 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:02:42.890 --> 05:02:42.900 align:start position:0%
there is a fairness issue as well not
 
05:02:44.690 --> 05:02:44.700 align:start position:0%
just fairness the atcs if people are
 
05:02:45.830 --> 05:02:45.840 align:start position:0%
going to be making millions of dollars
 
05:02:48.288 --> 05:02:48.298 align:start position:0%
off of cannabis and yet there are still
 
05:02:49.610 --> 05:02:49.620 align:start position:0%
Granite Staters walking around with
 
05:02:52.070 --> 05:02:52.080 align:start position:0%
criminal records for possession
 
05:02:53.930 --> 05:02:53.940 align:start position:0%
we'd love to see annulment included if
 
05:02:55.730 --> 05:02:55.740 align:start position:0%
it can be
 
05:02:58.910 --> 05:02:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:01.010 --> 05:03:01.020 align:start position:0%
yes representative Sullivan um you're
 
05:03:02.270 --> 05:03:02.280 align:start position:0%
talking about the independent testing
 
05:03:04.850 --> 05:03:04.860 align:start position:0%
which I get the logic behind it I'm
 
05:03:06.350 --> 05:03:06.360 align:start position:0%
curious do you or does anybody in this
 
05:03:08.868 --> 05:03:08.878 align:start position:0%
room know who tests like when I buy a
 
05:03:10.490 --> 05:03:10.500 align:start position:0%
bottle of beer sometimes it's you know
 
05:03:12.230 --> 05:03:12.240 align:start position:0%
five percent alcohol sometimes it's nine
 
05:03:14.690 --> 05:03:14.700 align:start position:0%
percent alcohol is that just the
 
05:03:16.310 --> 05:03:16.320 align:start position:0%
manufacturer selling us or is there some
 
05:03:18.948 --> 05:03:18.958 align:start position:0%
sort of process that is third party so
 
05:03:20.628 --> 05:03:20.638 align:start position:0%
that we can because I don't know of
 
05:03:23.628 --> 05:03:23.638 align:start position:0%
anybody not trusting what's it's not
 
05:03:25.490 --> 05:03:25.500 align:start position:0%
tested it's just the manufacturer's
 
05:03:29.208 --> 05:03:29.218 align:start position:0%
labeling so okay so thank you for the
 
05:03:30.650 --> 05:03:30.660 align:start position:0%
question I think cannabis is different
 
05:03:33.170 --> 05:03:33.180 align:start position:0%
in the sense that a lot of unregulated
 
05:03:35.510 --> 05:03:35.520 align:start position:0%
Market cannabis is Tainted with
 
05:03:39.110 --> 05:03:39.120 align:start position:0%
pesticides with fungicides with mold
 
05:03:42.650 --> 05:03:42.660 align:start position:0%
with heavy metals uh so a regulated
 
05:03:45.110 --> 05:03:45.120 align:start position:0%
market is the way to make that not
 
05:03:48.470 --> 05:03:48.480 align:start position:0%
happen in a legal Market the atcs have
 
05:03:51.708 --> 05:03:51.718 align:start position:0%
stringent testing requirements we have
 
05:03:53.930 --> 05:03:53.940 align:start position:0%
to have all of our cannabis each batch
 
05:03:56.510 --> 05:03:56.520 align:start position:0%
independently lab tested all of our
 
05:04:00.230 --> 05:04:00.240 align:start position:0%
labels include not just the THC content
 
05:04:03.050 --> 05:04:03.060 align:start position:0%
but all of the cannabinoids that show up
 
05:04:05.110 --> 05:04:05.120 align:start position:0%
on the test get included the percentages
 
05:04:07.430 --> 05:04:07.440 align:start position:0%
include all the terpenes which are the
 
05:04:10.010 --> 05:04:10.020 align:start position:0%
flavor molecules in cannabis we do very
 
05:04:12.350 --> 05:04:12.360 align:start position:0%
rigorous testing and we inform patients
 
05:04:14.628 --> 05:04:14.638 align:start position:0%
about everything that's in in their
 
05:04:14.638 --> 05:04:16.010 align:start position:0%
about everything that's in in their
cannabis

05:04:16.010 --> 05:04:16.020 align:start position:0%
cannabis
 
05:04:18.530 --> 05:04:18.540 align:start position:0%
another question yep for the question
 
05:04:18.540 --> 05:04:19.850 align:start position:0%
another question yep for the question
um so

05:04:19.850 --> 05:04:19.860 align:start position:0%
um so
 
05:04:21.890 --> 05:04:21.900 align:start position:0%
basically you're saying because right
 
05:04:24.410 --> 05:04:24.420 align:start position:0%
now it's an illicit Market we need this
 
05:04:26.208 --> 05:04:26.218 align:start position:0%
testing to give confidence to the people
 
05:04:28.670 --> 05:04:28.680 align:start position:0%
in third party testing is is why you're
 
05:04:29.868 --> 05:04:29.878 align:start position:0%
pushing for third-party testing versus
 
05:04:31.490 --> 05:04:31.500 align:start position:0%
looking at the liquor model where people
 
05:04:33.530 --> 05:04:33.540 align:start position:0%
will test their own yeah I just think
 
05:04:35.030 --> 05:04:35.040 align:start position:0%
it's one of the most important reasons
 
05:04:37.190 --> 05:04:37.200 align:start position:0%
to have a regulated market for cannabis
 
05:04:43.190 --> 05:04:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:45.890 --> 05:04:45.900 align:start position:0%
um no problem for me to add that into my
 
05:04:49.850 --> 05:04:49.860 align:start position:0%
Amendment but uh very good evidently uh
 
05:04:51.890 --> 05:04:51.900 align:start position:0%
yeah representative
 
05:04:51.900 --> 05:04:53.330 align:start position:0%
yeah representative
Osborne

05:04:53.330 --> 05:04:53.340 align:start position:0%
Osborne
 
05:04:55.430 --> 05:04:55.440 align:start position:0%
um so yeah we'd already talked about the
 
05:04:57.410 --> 05:04:57.420 align:start position:0%
independent testing earlier today yeah
 
05:04:59.570 --> 05:04:59.580 align:start position:0%
um but um we also talked about the
 
05:05:02.090 --> 05:05:02.100 align:start position:0%
independent Advisory Board and uh I know
 
05:05:04.390 --> 05:05:04.400 align:start position:0%
you're not a fan of that
 
05:05:06.830 --> 05:05:06.840 align:start position:0%
what do you think the possibility of
 
05:05:09.230 --> 05:05:09.240 align:start position:0%
bolting something like I heard two
 
05:05:11.810 --> 05:05:11.820 align:start position:0%
things The Advisory Board and then a new
 
05:05:11.820 --> 05:05:13.850 align:start position:0%
things The Advisory Board and then a new
Commission

05:05:13.850 --> 05:05:13.860 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
05:05:15.948 --> 05:05:15.958 align:start position:0%
well yeah I mean that was there which
 
05:05:17.510 --> 05:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
one is which the original bill was to
 
05:05:19.128 --> 05:05:19.138 align:start position:0%
create a commission and an Advisory
 
05:05:21.770 --> 05:05:21.780 align:start position:0%
board right that that I that was I was
 
05:05:23.930 --> 05:05:23.940 align:start position:0%
really but in your model of handing it
 
05:05:25.310 --> 05:05:25.320 align:start position:0%
over to the Liquor Commission instead
 
05:05:26.570 --> 05:05:26.580 align:start position:0%
because there already exists they know
 
05:05:28.550 --> 05:05:28.560 align:start position:0%
how to do business and whatnot right but
 
05:05:30.830 --> 05:05:30.840 align:start position:0%
what about bolting on an independent
 
05:05:33.170 --> 05:05:33.180 align:start position:0%
cannabis Advisory Board just to make
 
05:05:34.850 --> 05:05:34.860 align:start position:0%
sure what is the purpose of The Advisory
 
05:05:36.948 --> 05:05:36.958 align:start position:0%
Board well because the Liquor Commission
 
05:05:38.810 --> 05:05:38.820 align:start position:0%
uh they they don't know anything about
 
05:05:40.430 --> 05:05:40.440 align:start position:0%
cannabis right right well I see I
 
05:05:41.990 --> 05:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
thought we we have the electric
 
05:05:43.490 --> 05:05:43.500 align:start position:0%
commission is going to be hiring
 
05:05:45.890 --> 05:05:45.900 align:start position:0%
somebody you know who knows where they
 
05:05:47.270 --> 05:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
come from maybe Washington or Colorado
 
05:05:50.570 --> 05:05:50.580 align:start position:0%
but or Oklahoma somebody who knows about
 
05:05:52.490 --> 05:05:52.500 align:start position:0%
what's going on and then and would be
 
05:05:53.930 --> 05:05:53.940 align:start position:0%
head of that division
 
05:05:58.010 --> 05:05:58.020 align:start position:0%
but in terms of The Advisory Board I
 
05:06:00.050 --> 05:06:00.060 align:start position:0%
guess I was really fuzzy on what are
 
05:06:02.448 --> 05:06:02.458 align:start position:0%
they advising when it's the commission
 
05:06:04.610 --> 05:06:04.620 align:start position:0%
that is the one is the actual operating
 
05:06:07.190 --> 05:06:07.200 align:start position:0%
of the licenses but so I was trying
 
05:06:08.868 --> 05:06:08.878 align:start position:0%
again I was trying to keep it simple but
 
05:06:11.208 --> 05:06:11.218 align:start position:0%
go ahead so Matt if I could ask you what
 
05:06:12.830 --> 05:06:12.840 align:start position:0%
would you say would be the difference
 
05:06:14.510 --> 05:06:14.520 align:start position:0%
between having an independent Advisory
 
05:06:16.128 --> 05:06:16.138 align:start position:0%
board about cannabis to The Liquor
 
05:06:17.570 --> 05:06:17.580 align:start position:0%
Commission versus having the Liquor
 
05:06:19.490 --> 05:06:19.500 align:start position:0%
Commission having a department within
 
05:06:21.650 --> 05:06:21.660 align:start position:0%
its own agency where they hire cannabis
 
05:06:21.660 --> 05:06:23.930 align:start position:0%
its own agency where they hire cannabis
professionals

05:06:23.930 --> 05:06:23.940 align:start position:0%
professionals
 
05:06:25.610 --> 05:06:25.620 align:start position:0%
I think the value of an independent
 
05:06:27.890 --> 05:06:27.900 align:start position:0%
Advisory Board is that it provides
 
05:06:29.990 --> 05:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
public transparency and it allows
 
05:06:31.910 --> 05:06:31.920 align:start position:0%
experts from a variety of different
 
05:06:34.250 --> 05:06:34.260 align:start position:0%
perspectives to be at the table when
 
05:06:36.770 --> 05:06:36.780 align:start position:0%
rules are being developed so somebody
 
05:06:38.628 --> 05:06:38.638 align:start position:0%
with experience with expertise in public
 
05:06:40.550 --> 05:06:40.560 align:start position:0%
health is asking those kinds of
 
05:06:42.650 --> 05:06:42.660 align:start position:0%
questions and making sure that there's
 
05:06:44.770 --> 05:06:44.780 align:start position:0%
there's scrutiny from that perspective
 
05:06:47.150 --> 05:06:47.160 align:start position:0%
somebody from that cares about Public
 
05:06:48.948 --> 05:06:48.958 align:start position:0%
Safety is there somebody who actually
 
05:06:51.650 --> 05:06:51.660 align:start position:0%
knows the Cannabis industry is there
 
05:06:53.510 --> 05:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
having all of this
 
05:06:56.090 --> 05:06:56.100 align:start position:0%
having them look over the shoulders of
 
05:06:57.350 --> 05:06:57.360 align:start position:0%
the Liquor Commission as they're
 
05:06:59.810 --> 05:06:59.820 align:start position:0%
developing rules and making sure that it
 
05:07:02.208 --> 05:07:02.218 align:start position:0%
is not a back room thing that somebody's
 
05:07:05.270 --> 05:07:05.280 align:start position:0%
coming up with rules and then bringing
 
05:07:07.128 --> 05:07:07.138 align:start position:0%
them into gel car and not anybody
 
05:07:09.350 --> 05:07:09.360 align:start position:0%
knowing what they are
 
05:07:11.390 --> 05:07:11.400 align:start position:0%
as I've said before it's a one-time
 
05:07:13.910 --> 05:07:13.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity and a lot of people have a
 
05:07:15.530 --> 05:07:15.540 align:start position:0%
lot of perspectives on how this should
 
05:07:18.170 --> 05:07:18.180 align:start position:0%
go other states have made some good
 
05:07:20.750 --> 05:07:20.760 align:start position:0%
choices and some bad choices and we
 
05:07:22.490 --> 05:07:22.500 align:start position:0%
should always be striving to learn from
 
05:07:25.250 --> 05:07:25.260 align:start position:0%
other states and try not to repeat
 
05:07:28.910 --> 05:07:28.920 align:start position:0%
mistakes if they're avoidable but I mean
 
05:07:30.530 --> 05:07:30.540 align:start position:0%
I don't know you skipped the step that
 
05:07:32.448 --> 05:07:32.458 align:start position:0%
in the rules committee where I hear that
 
05:07:35.590 --> 05:07:35.600 align:start position:0%
they ask for suggestions and proposals
 
05:07:38.330 --> 05:07:38.340 align:start position:0%
and they take you know work those
 
05:07:40.490 --> 05:07:40.500 align:start position:0%
through I the idea that there's back
 
05:07:43.128 --> 05:07:43.138 align:start position:0%
room dealing with rulemaking you're the
 
05:07:45.530 --> 05:07:45.540 align:start position:0%
first person who's ever said that to me
 
05:07:47.570 --> 05:07:47.580 align:start position:0%
in all my years
 
05:07:50.330 --> 05:07:50.340 align:start position:0%
interesting no one has ever said there
 
05:07:51.770 --> 05:07:51.780 align:start position:0%
was a backroom deal when it came to
 
05:07:53.570 --> 05:07:53.580 align:start position:0%
rulemaking I've never heard that I've
 
05:07:55.010 --> 05:07:55.020 align:start position:0%
always heard about the public hearings
 
05:07:57.708 --> 05:07:57.718 align:start position:0%
and the public process I did hear that
 
05:07:58.970 --> 05:07:58.980 align:start position:0%
we don't make the lobbyists wear their
 
05:08:01.550 --> 05:08:01.560 align:start position:0%
orange tag at rulemaking hearing so that
 
05:08:03.470 --> 05:08:03.480 align:start position:0%
I did that I did here you didn't have to
 
05:08:04.788 --> 05:08:04.798 align:start position:0%
wear that when you go to the room of
 
05:08:06.650 --> 05:08:06.660 align:start position:0%
making but
 
05:08:08.930 --> 05:08:08.940 align:start position:0%
okay well like I say all of this is
 
05:08:10.788 --> 05:08:10.798 align:start position:0%
going to take time so yeah
 
05:08:13.250 --> 05:08:13.260 align:start position:0%
representative Philip
 
05:08:15.050 --> 05:08:15.060 align:start position:0%
it would seem that the the value of the
 
05:08:17.930 --> 05:08:17.940 align:start position:0%
independent advisory committee or board
 
05:08:20.448 --> 05:08:20.458 align:start position:0%
would be simply that advisory and
 
05:08:22.310 --> 05:08:22.320 align:start position:0%
provide a central point for the industry
 
05:08:24.948 --> 05:08:24.958 align:start position:0%
to provide advice that could then be
 
05:08:27.170 --> 05:08:27.180 align:start position:0%
passed on to the commission it would be
 
05:08:29.810 --> 05:08:29.820 align:start position:0%
efficiency I think of having one Central
 
05:08:32.090 --> 05:08:32.100 align:start position:0%
repository where the industry could go
 
05:08:34.730 --> 05:08:34.740 align:start position:0%
to then to provide its input to then be
 
05:08:37.788 --> 05:08:37.798 align:start position:0%
passed on to the commission and provide
 
05:08:39.470 --> 05:08:39.480 align:start position:0%
also that transparency it essentially
 
05:08:41.390 --> 05:08:41.400 align:start position:0%
would be a public committee that could
 
05:08:43.610 --> 05:08:43.620 align:start position:0%
then have that public record of the
 
05:08:45.470 --> 05:08:45.480 align:start position:0%
entire industry providing that input
 
05:08:47.510 --> 05:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
that could then be passed on right to
 
05:08:49.550 --> 05:08:49.560 align:start position:0%
the commission it actually would provide
 
05:08:51.948 --> 05:08:51.958 align:start position:0%
I think efficiency to the commission of
 
05:08:53.868 --> 05:08:53.878 align:start position:0%
having a central repository of this
 
05:08:55.310 --> 05:08:55.320 align:start position:0%
public testimony that could then be
 
05:08:57.110 --> 05:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
passed on rather than getting that all
 
05:08:59.750 --> 05:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
through noticing of rulemaking to the
 
05:09:03.230 --> 05:09:03.240 align:start position:0%
atcs do they have an Advisory Board
 
05:09:06.470 --> 05:09:06.480 align:start position:0%
no so I was part of
 
05:09:08.930 --> 05:09:08.940 align:start position:0%
the rule making process for therapeutic
 
05:09:11.570 --> 05:09:11.580 align:start position:0%
cannabis and uh
 
05:09:13.430 --> 05:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
I will say that I had to show up at a
 
05:09:16.010 --> 05:09:16.020 align:start position:0%
whole lot of in-person meetings
 
05:09:17.750 --> 05:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
usually by myself sometimes with
 
05:09:19.310 --> 05:09:19.320 align:start position:0%
somebody from the ACLU of New Hampshire
 
05:09:21.708 --> 05:09:21.718 align:start position:0%
and we were the only two Patient
 
05:09:23.510 --> 05:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
Advocates who remained involved
 
05:09:25.190 --> 05:09:25.200 align:start position:0%
throughout that process and we took it
 
05:09:27.110 --> 05:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
upon ourselves to always be in the room
 
05:09:29.208 --> 05:09:29.218 align:start position:0%
when rules were being debated and
 
05:09:32.090 --> 05:09:32.100 align:start position:0%
discussed and uh
 
05:09:34.850 --> 05:09:34.860 align:start position:0%
there was an advisory Council that was
 
05:09:38.150 --> 05:09:38.160 align:start position:0%
created to oversee that program but it
 
05:09:40.010 --> 05:09:40.020 align:start position:0%
was still trying to figure out what was
 
05:09:42.770 --> 05:09:42.780 align:start position:0%
going on so um
 
05:09:44.690 --> 05:09:44.700 align:start position:0%
does this still exist now the advisory
 
05:09:46.910 --> 05:09:46.920 align:start position:0%
Council no it was repealed and replaced
 
05:09:48.230 --> 05:09:48.240 align:start position:0%
with a therapeutic cannabis medical
 
05:09:50.390 --> 05:09:50.400 align:start position:0%
oversight board so now we have a an
 
05:09:52.190 --> 05:09:52.200 align:start position:0%
independent Board of medical
 
05:09:54.350 --> 05:09:54.360 align:start position:0%
professionals primarily and one patient
 
05:09:56.330 --> 05:09:56.340 align:start position:0%
who who provide the oversight that the
 
05:09:58.368 --> 05:09:58.378 align:start position:0%
advisory Council used to have one of the
 
05:10:00.170 --> 05:10:00.180 align:start position:0%
issues with the advisory council is that
 
05:10:02.030 --> 05:10:02.040 align:start position:0%
many of the opponents of therapeutic
 
05:10:03.708 --> 05:10:03.718 align:start position:0%
cannabis were then named of the advisory
 
05:10:05.868 --> 05:10:05.878 align:start position:0%
Council so we had to fight some of the
 
05:10:09.110 --> 05:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
same battles all over again
 
05:10:11.208 --> 05:10:11.218 align:start position:0%
trying to get the bill implemented that
 
05:10:13.250 --> 05:10:13.260 align:start position:0%
we'd had to fight to get the bill passed
 
05:10:15.170 --> 05:10:15.180 align:start position:0%
okay so the reason we don't want one of
 
05:10:17.448 --> 05:10:17.458 align:start position:0%
these advisory is because the governor
 
05:10:20.510 --> 05:10:20.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:22.190 --> 05:10:22.200 align:start position:0%
well they're spelled out in the bill and
 
05:10:23.868 --> 05:10:23.878 align:start position:0%
and some of them are are left to the
 
05:10:23.878 --> 05:10:24.770 align:start position:0%
and some of them are are left to the
governor

05:10:24.770 --> 05:10:24.780 align:start position:0%
governor
 
05:10:28.670 --> 05:10:28.680 align:start position:0%
so the problem is who who gets appointed
 
05:10:30.230 --> 05:10:30.240 align:start position:0%
that's the problem with these these
 
05:10:32.150 --> 05:10:32.160 align:start position:0%
oversight well isn't isn't that
 
05:10:33.288 --> 05:10:33.298 align:start position:0%
something that we can just deal with in
 
05:10:34.490 --> 05:10:34.500 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
05:10:37.430 --> 05:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
right not put them in right and they're
 
05:10:39.650 --> 05:10:39.660 align:start position:0%
saying is that you know you know how
 
05:10:41.930 --> 05:10:41.940 align:start position:0%
they get a point it's political that
 
05:10:44.510 --> 05:10:44.520 align:start position:0%
that the appointment comes in so when it
 
05:10:45.948 --> 05:10:45.958 align:start position:0%
was like the speaker of the house and
 
05:10:47.270 --> 05:10:47.280 align:start position:0%
the Senate President they make
 
05:10:47.280 --> 05:10:48.948 align:start position:0%
the Senate President they make
appointments

05:10:48.948 --> 05:10:48.958 align:start position:0%
appointments
 
05:10:52.690 --> 05:10:52.700 align:start position:0%
it's all spelled out in hb639 yeah
 
05:10:54.948 --> 05:10:54.958 align:start position:0%
no in terms of the I was talking about
 
05:10:57.288 --> 05:10:57.298 align:start position:0%
the ATC one
 
05:10:59.930 --> 05:10:59.940 align:start position:0%
the ATC advisor The Advisory Council
 
05:11:03.050 --> 05:11:03.060 align:start position:0%
that has since been repealed yes
 
05:11:04.670 --> 05:11:04.680 align:start position:0%
I mean it was a representative from the
 
05:11:06.350 --> 05:11:06.360 align:start position:0%
police Chiefs Association and a
 
05:11:07.730 --> 05:11:07.740 align:start position:0%
representative of the Attorney General's
 
05:11:10.910 --> 05:11:10.920 align:start position:0%
office and a representing yeah a number
 
05:11:13.368 --> 05:11:13.378 align:start position:0%
of them were named and then there was
 
05:11:15.708 --> 05:11:15.718 align:start position:0%
a patient representative who was to be
 
05:11:17.150 --> 05:11:17.160 align:start position:0%
named by the governor but then the
 
05:11:18.708 --> 05:11:18.718 align:start position:0%
governor named a patient that none of us
 
05:11:20.090 --> 05:11:20.100 align:start position:0%
had ever heard of and never came to a
 
05:11:20.100 --> 05:11:20.810 align:start position:0%
had ever heard of and never came to a
meeting

05:11:20.810 --> 05:11:20.820 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
05:11:24.948 --> 05:11:24.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:24.958 --> 05:11:27.110 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:11:27.110 --> 05:11:27.120 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:11:30.050 --> 05:11:30.060 align:start position:0%
so you know it's fine if people want to
 
05:11:31.670 --> 05:11:31.680 align:start position:0%
pass 639
 
05:11:33.350 --> 05:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
we can make some changes
 
05:11:34.970 --> 05:11:34.980 align:start position:0%
how are you gonna make changes in one
 
05:11:39.830 --> 05:11:39.840 align:start position:0%
week right yeah all right so we will uh
 
05:11:42.410 --> 05:11:42.420 align:start position:0%
if you have suggestions that you want to
 
05:11:47.090 --> 05:11:47.100 align:start position:0%
make to 639 changing 639 as is uh please
 
05:11:49.128 --> 05:11:49.138 align:start position:0%
get it to the committee
 
05:11:52.190 --> 05:11:52.200 align:start position:0%
and we will uh take him up one one by
 
05:11:59.930 --> 05:11:59.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:04.788 --> 05:12:04.798 align:start position:0%
question so it's still illegal federally
 
05:12:08.270 --> 05:12:08.280 align:start position:0%
right so I'm not sure if this bill needs
 
05:12:11.448 --> 05:12:11.458 align:start position:0%
to determine what the issues are between
 
05:12:14.208 --> 05:12:14.218 align:start position:0%
the federal laws and the state laws and
 
05:12:15.830 --> 05:12:15.840 align:start position:0%
how they would be
 
05:12:15.840 --> 05:12:20.030 align:start position:0%
how they would be
adjudicated

05:12:20.030 --> 05:12:20.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:22.190 --> 05:12:22.200 align:start position:0%
so the federal government has its laws
 
05:12:23.750 --> 05:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
and the state of New Hampshire has its
 
05:12:25.850 --> 05:12:25.860 align:start position:0%
laws New Hampshire law enforcement
 
05:12:28.490 --> 05:12:28.500 align:start position:0%
enforces New Hampshire laws
 
05:12:31.310 --> 05:12:31.320 align:start position:0%
99 percent of cannabis arrests are made
 
05:12:32.810 --> 05:12:32.820 align:start position:0%
by state state and local police
 
05:12:36.890 --> 05:12:36.900 align:start position:0%
enforcing state laws so if the federal
 
05:12:38.990 --> 05:12:39.000 align:start position:0%
government wanted to send DEA agents to
 
05:12:41.150 --> 05:12:41.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and arrest all of us who
 
05:12:42.830 --> 05:12:42.840 align:start position:0%
consume cannabis all of us that run the
 
05:12:44.270 --> 05:12:44.280 align:start position:0%
atcs they
 
05:12:45.890 --> 05:12:45.900 align:start position:0%
technically have the authority to done
 
05:12:48.288 --> 05:12:48.298 align:start position:0%
that do that Congress has checked that
 
05:12:51.050 --> 05:12:51.060 align:start position:0%
Authority by passing budget writers that
 
05:12:53.090 --> 05:12:53.100 align:start position:0%
tell them not to spend money to
 
05:12:55.550 --> 05:12:55.560 align:start position:0%
undermine State regulated cannabis
 
05:12:57.948 --> 05:12:57.958 align:start position:0%
markets so so far they haven't I was
 
05:13:00.948 --> 05:13:00.958 align:start position:0%
thinking more like Banking and you know
 
05:13:02.810 --> 05:13:02.820 align:start position:0%
I don't know applying for federal jobs
 
05:13:05.208 --> 05:13:05.218 align:start position:0%
things like that
 
05:13:07.970 --> 05:13:07.980 align:start position:0%
with banking I'm pleased to report we've
 
05:13:10.368 --> 05:13:10.378 align:start position:0%
had access to banking throughout the
 
05:13:14.510 --> 05:13:14.520 align:start position:0%
atc's existence we've never had to
 
05:13:17.030 --> 05:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
deal with cash the way some markets Out
 
05:13:19.250 --> 05:13:19.260 align:start position:0%
West have
 
05:13:22.610 --> 05:13:22.620 align:start position:0%
I don't know if that will be an issue
 
05:13:24.770 --> 05:13:24.780 align:start position:0%
for adult use cannabis but the only
 
05:13:26.208 --> 05:13:26.218 align:start position:0%
people who can fix it are the federal
 
05:13:27.890 --> 05:13:27.900 align:start position:0%
government there's a bill called the
 
05:13:30.110 --> 05:13:30.120 align:start position:0%
safe Banking Act that's been debated in
 
05:13:32.090 --> 05:13:32.100 align:start position:0%
Congress for years and
 
05:13:33.530 --> 05:13:33.540 align:start position:0%
they could certainly make it a lot
 
05:13:35.628 --> 05:13:35.638 align:start position:0%
easier for financial institutions to do
 
05:13:37.490 --> 05:13:37.500 align:start position:0%
business with with cannabis businesses
 
05:13:39.830 --> 05:13:39.840 align:start position:0%
but as is in the Northeast the vast
 
05:13:41.810 --> 05:13:41.820 align:start position:0%
majority of businesses do have limited
 
05:13:43.550 --> 05:13:43.560 align:start position:0%
banking services now to be clear we
 
05:13:45.288 --> 05:13:45.298 align:start position:0%
can't get loans we can't get business
 
05:13:48.288 --> 05:13:48.298 align:start position:0%
the kinds of products are available to
 
05:13:49.670 --> 05:13:49.680 align:start position:0%
most businesses are completely off
 
05:13:51.890 --> 05:13:51.900 align:start position:0%
limits we can pay very high fees for
 
05:13:55.788 --> 05:13:55.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:55.798 --> 05:13:58.490 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:13:58.490 --> 05:13:58.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:01.250 --> 05:14:01.260 align:start position:0%
would it make sense would it make sense
 
05:14:03.350 --> 05:14:03.360 align:start position:0%
for you and and a couple of your
 
05:14:05.628 --> 05:14:05.638 align:start position:0%
colleagues on the coalition to provide
 
05:14:07.970 --> 05:14:07.980 align:start position:0%
us as quickly as possible with a list of
 
05:14:09.890 --> 05:14:09.900 align:start position:0%
what you can live with and what you what
 
05:14:11.690 --> 05:14:11.700 align:start position:0%
you can't live with in terms of the
 
05:14:11.700 --> 05:14:14.690 align:start position:0%
you can't live with in terms of the
amendment

05:14:14.690 --> 05:14:14.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:18.350 --> 05:14:18.360 align:start position:0%
I I can certainly provide what Prime ATC
 
05:14:20.690 --> 05:14:20.700 align:start position:0%
thinks is important for the amendment I
 
05:14:22.490 --> 05:14:22.500 align:start position:0%
don't know if the Coalition will agree
 
05:14:25.330 --> 05:14:25.340 align:start position:0%
on a United set of things
 
05:14:29.090 --> 05:14:29.100 align:start position:0%
we were United on a drafting process
 
05:14:31.610 --> 05:14:31.620 align:start position:0%
and process of getting feedback on our
 
05:14:34.250 --> 05:14:34.260 align:start position:0%
draft and now the Bill's been introduced
 
05:14:36.050 --> 05:14:36.060 align:start position:0%
so we're we we each have slightly
 
05:14:37.730 --> 05:14:37.740 align:start position:0%
different views and opinions on some of
 
05:14:40.250 --> 05:14:40.260 align:start position:0%
the details I'm happy to get I'm happy
 
05:14:43.610 --> 05:14:43.620 align:start position:0%
to try to facilitate a coherent response
 
05:14:45.708 --> 05:14:45.718 align:start position:0%
from the Coalition if not get every
 
05:14:47.810 --> 05:14:47.820 align:start position:0%
member to weigh in with what they think
 
05:14:52.368 --> 05:14:52.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:54.050 --> 05:14:54.060 align:start position:0%
so um
 
05:14:55.910 --> 05:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
do you guys care much about the other
 
05:14:55.920 --> 05:14:57.110 align:start position:0%
do you guys care much about the other
bill

05:14:57.110 --> 05:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:15:00.530 --> 05:15:00.540 align:start position:0%
leave five what is it five
 
05:15:02.448 --> 05:15:02.458 align:start position:0%
five Forty Four
 
05:15:04.730 --> 05:15:04.740 align:start position:0%
do you have any love love
 
05:15:07.310 --> 05:15:07.320 align:start position:0%
hey any feelings towards that
 
05:15:09.110 --> 05:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
because I'm thinking that what we'll do
 
05:15:12.288 --> 05:15:12.298 align:start position:0%
is uh you guys want to pass 639 it's
 
05:15:14.750 --> 05:15:14.760 align:start position:0%
current form or whatever amendments that
 
05:15:16.310 --> 05:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
you can hammer out
 
05:15:19.910 --> 05:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
we passed that out and then we have a
 
05:15:22.070 --> 05:15:22.080 align:start position:0%
month through 5 44.
 
05:15:24.110 --> 05:15:24.120 align:start position:0%
and try to address some of these issues
 
05:15:29.330 --> 05:15:29.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:32.330 --> 05:15:32.340 align:start position:0%
I in terms of I don't know where the
 
05:15:35.810 --> 05:15:35.820 align:start position:0%
consensus is that is that uh I guess uh
 
05:15:38.510 --> 05:15:38.520 align:start position:0%
I was saying that two is better than ten
 
05:15:40.628 --> 05:15:40.638 align:start position:0%
one or none
 
05:15:44.270 --> 05:15:44.280 align:start position:0%
or in terms of is it
 
05:15:45.830 --> 05:15:45.840 align:start position:0%
to retain which one you want to retain
 
05:15:46.970 --> 05:15:46.980 align:start position:0%
no we have to
 
05:15:48.770 --> 05:15:48.780 align:start position:0%
I don't want to retain it
 
05:15:51.770 --> 05:15:51.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:53.750 --> 05:15:53.760 align:start position:0%
let's get it let's get a list of things
 
05:15:56.448 --> 05:15:56.458 align:start position:0%
we can live with and do it let's just do
 
05:15:58.070 --> 05:15:58.080 align:start position:0%
it right you know I don't want this to
 
05:16:01.368 --> 05:16:01.378 align:start position:0%
go away no really right well then on it
 
05:16:03.470 --> 05:16:03.480 align:start position:0%
next week and then then let the Senate
 
05:16:06.230 --> 05:16:06.240 align:start position:0%
decide which one they like better
 
05:16:08.628 --> 05:16:08.638 align:start position:0%
I don't care about the Senate I do well
 
05:16:11.590 --> 05:16:11.600 align:start position:0%
yes we do we're in the house
 
05:16:14.930 --> 05:16:14.940 align:start position:0%
no we know that the Senate is has their
 
05:16:17.570 --> 05:16:17.580 align:start position:0%
knives out so we we so talk to all the
 
05:16:20.390 --> 05:16:20.400 align:start position:0%
Senators I have talked to Senators yes
 
05:16:22.788 --> 05:16:22.798 align:start position:0%
but notwithstanding this I'm trying to
 
05:16:26.510 --> 05:16:26.520 align:start position:0%
be I'm trying to facilitate passage so
 
05:16:29.510 --> 05:16:29.520 align:start position:0%
if there's a a interest that says that
 
05:16:32.628 --> 05:16:32.638 align:start position:0%
yet their heart set on 679 because they
 
05:16:34.690 --> 05:16:34.700 align:start position:0%
all work so hard on it and believe
 
05:16:37.730 --> 05:16:37.740 align:start position:0%
believe in what's in it and you guys
 
05:16:39.890 --> 05:16:39.900 align:start position:0%
have decided that you
 
05:16:43.368 --> 05:16:43.378 align:start position:0%
believe in them yeah then I think we
 
05:16:45.530 --> 05:16:45.540 align:start position:0%
should do a bill you're you know we have
 
05:16:48.050 --> 05:16:48.060 align:start position:0%
to we we're it's a tight window
 
05:16:51.170 --> 05:16:51.180 align:start position:0%
you get an amendment done and ready and
 
05:16:54.230 --> 05:16:54.240 align:start position:0%
we'll vote on Wednesday uh and send it
 
05:16:56.510 --> 05:16:56.520 align:start position:0%
to the house floor it still has to go to
 
05:16:58.910 --> 05:16:58.920 align:start position:0%
finance or a second committee anyways I
 
05:17:00.650 --> 05:17:00.660 align:start position:0%
think it's Finance
 
05:17:04.190 --> 05:17:04.200 align:start position:0%
um and in the meantime then I can work
 
05:17:06.110 --> 05:17:06.120 align:start position:0%
on the other bill
 
05:17:09.050 --> 05:17:09.060 align:start position:0%
and have my Amendment and take what
 
05:17:11.150 --> 05:17:11.160 align:start position:0%
those things that I I think are worth
 
05:17:13.970 --> 05:17:13.980 align:start position:0%
working on and and uh people want to you
 
05:17:15.288 --> 05:17:15.298 align:start position:0%
know think it's really important to know
 
05:17:17.510 --> 05:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
what the tax structure is right away and
 
05:17:18.590 --> 05:17:18.600 align:start position:0%
they don't want to have a hearings
 
05:17:21.410 --> 05:17:21.420 align:start position:0%
process because they think they're
 
05:17:24.410 --> 05:17:24.420 align:start position:0%
behind the scenes stuff going on in a
 
05:17:26.690 --> 05:17:26.700 align:start position:0%
hearings process then we'll try to I'll
 
05:17:28.850 --> 05:17:28.860 align:start position:0%
try to limit limit shrink some of those
 
05:17:28.860 --> 05:17:32.750 align:start position:0%
try to limit limit shrink some of those
down

05:17:32.750 --> 05:17:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:35.570 --> 05:17:35.580 align:start position:0%
hopefully be quickly
 
05:17:37.550 --> 05:17:37.560 align:start position:0%
could we have a zoom or something just
 
05:17:40.070 --> 05:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
to see what we agree on what's what kind
 
05:17:42.230 --> 05:17:42.240 align:start position:0%
of process can we do well we don't need
 
05:17:45.230 --> 05:17:45.240 align:start position:0%
Zoom I can I mean you we can schedule
 
05:17:46.850 --> 05:17:46.860 align:start position:0%
I mean I would do is I would schedule
 
05:17:48.770 --> 05:17:48.780 align:start position:0%
after if you want it they will have
 
05:17:50.510 --> 05:17:50.520 align:start position:0%
should have it you could have it by
 
05:17:53.150 --> 05:17:53.160 align:start position:0%
Tuesday so we could do after after
 
05:17:53.160 --> 05:17:54.530 align:start position:0%
Tuesday so we could do after after
session

05:17:54.530 --> 05:17:54.540 align:start position:0%
session
 
05:17:56.030 --> 05:17:56.040 align:start position:0%
I'll put it on the schedule that after
 
05:17:59.990 --> 05:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
session we'll have a subcommittee on 639
 
05:18:02.208 --> 05:18:02.218 align:start position:0%
and hopefully we'll Hammer up some you
 
05:18:04.368 --> 05:18:04.378 align:start position:0%
know what what you want to run with
 
05:18:07.010 --> 05:18:07.020 align:start position:0%
and and but I will be frank that I'm I
 
05:18:10.128 --> 05:18:10.138 align:start position:0%
still think I'm right that should that
 
05:18:12.110 --> 05:18:12.120 align:start position:0%
this bill this bill is never going to
 
05:18:15.050 --> 05:18:15.060 align:start position:0%
make it and and so therefore I'll that's
 
05:18:17.030 --> 05:18:17.040 align:start position:0%
give the Senate a choice
 
05:18:19.070 --> 05:18:19.080 align:start position:0%
I'm pro-choice so would you be able to
 
05:18:20.810 --> 05:18:20.820 align:start position:0%
get us something before Tuesday next
 
05:18:23.208 --> 05:18:23.218 align:start position:0%
Tuesday yeah yeah I certainly can from
 
05:18:25.368 --> 05:18:25.378 align:start position:0%
from our perspective okay great thank
 
05:18:25.378 --> 05:18:26.690 align:start position:0%
from our perspective okay great thank
you

05:18:26.690 --> 05:18:26.700 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:18:29.150 --> 05:18:29.160 align:start position:0%
if we wanted to we could continue this
 
05:18:32.330 --> 05:18:32.340 align:start position:0%
meeting to tomorrow the next day or any
 
05:18:33.770 --> 05:18:33.780 align:start position:0%
other time correct
 
05:18:35.868 --> 05:18:35.878 align:start position:0%
uh week this is a subcommittee so we
 
05:18:37.970 --> 05:18:37.980 align:start position:0%
could schedule right away yeah so we
 
05:18:39.770 --> 05:18:39.780 align:start position:0%
could we could get out there
 
05:18:44.090 --> 05:18:44.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:44.100 --> 05:18:48.470 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:18:48.470 --> 05:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:51.350 --> 05:18:51.360 align:start position:0%
you know the structure the structure is
 
05:18:54.288 --> 05:18:54.298 align:start position:0%
you use well I guess what structure
 
05:18:56.090 --> 05:18:56.100 align:start position:0%
which Bill are you working from what did
 
05:18:57.350 --> 05:18:57.360 align:start position:0%
you want them
 
05:18:59.930 --> 05:18:59.940 align:start position:0%
to be fixed working on that we want on
 
05:19:02.090 --> 05:19:02.100 align:start position:0%
work on the original 639 in its current
 
05:19:02.100 --> 05:19:06.170 align:start position:0%
work on the original 639 in its current
form

05:19:06.170 --> 05:19:06.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:08.090 --> 05:19:08.100 align:start position:0%
well I assume all these things here are
 
05:19:09.530 --> 05:19:09.540 align:start position:0%
in 639
 
05:19:12.288 --> 05:19:12.298 align:start position:0%
yeah the original yeah so there's that's
 
05:19:16.190 --> 05:19:16.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:16.200 --> 05:19:20.990 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:19:20.990 --> 05:19:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:24.230 --> 05:19:24.240 align:start position:0%
Simon and your amendment to see what we
 
05:19:26.090 --> 05:19:26.100 align:start position:0%
can pull which but which Bill are you
 
05:19:30.110 --> 05:19:30.120 align:start position:0%
working from which one as an unamended
 
05:19:34.430 --> 05:19:34.440 align:start position:0%
original right so but you're asking
 
05:19:37.250 --> 05:19:37.260 align:start position:0%
them to make changes to six or nine and
 
05:19:38.570 --> 05:19:38.580 align:start position:0%
they don't have it I don't assume they
 
05:19:44.510 --> 05:19:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:46.250 --> 05:19:46.260 align:start position:0%
or with the
 
05:19:48.170 --> 05:19:48.180 align:start position:0%
with the changes that we were just
 
05:19:50.208 --> 05:19:50.218 align:start position:0%
discussing to make it
 
05:19:54.128 --> 05:19:54.138 align:start position:0%
an easy path an easier pass for for uh
 
05:19:57.050 --> 05:19:57.060 align:start position:0%
commission you know okay I think it's a
 
05:19:59.090 --> 05:19:59.100 align:start position:0%
question of what changes
 
05:20:02.090 --> 05:20:02.100 align:start position:0%
um his organization can live with
 
05:20:04.430 --> 05:20:04.440 align:start position:0%
that yeah that would have been that
 
05:20:06.770 --> 05:20:06.780 align:start position:0%
would have been with my Amendment you
 
05:20:08.448 --> 05:20:08.458 align:start position:0%
didn't discuss with them your Amendment
 
05:20:10.310 --> 05:20:10.320 align:start position:0%
so that's what I'm saying I'm a little
 
05:20:12.230 --> 05:20:12.240 align:start position:0%
fuzzy in what we're doing because I just
 
05:20:14.510 --> 05:20:14.520 align:start position:0%
heard a presentation to say that we like
 
05:20:18.288 --> 05:20:18.298 align:start position:0%
639 as presented in its original format
 
05:20:19.730 --> 05:20:19.740 align:start position:0%
but they're willing to make some
 
05:20:21.288 --> 05:20:21.298 align:start position:0%
adjustment yeah he said he was willing
 
05:20:23.930 --> 05:20:23.940 align:start position:0%
to compromise he said so you guys are
 
05:20:26.208 --> 05:20:26.218 align:start position:0%
ready and rearing to make changes to the
 
05:20:28.128 --> 05:20:28.138 align:start position:0%
bill as introduced
 
05:20:30.708 --> 05:20:30.718 align:start position:0%
to consult with them
 
05:20:30.718 --> 05:20:36.708 align:start position:0%
to consult with them
yeah

05:20:36.708 --> 05:20:36.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:39.050 --> 05:20:39.060 align:start position:0%
I gotcha okay I guess I didn't hear that
 
05:20:40.610 --> 05:20:40.620 align:start position:0%
part yeah no okay I didn't hear this
 
05:20:40.620 --> 05:20:45.010 align:start position:0%
part yeah no okay I didn't hear this
okay

05:20:45.010 --> 05:20:45.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:47.448 --> 05:20:47.458 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I've already spoken with a
 
05:20:49.070 --> 05:20:49.080 align:start position:0%
number of other members of the Coalition
 
05:20:51.650 --> 05:20:51.660 align:start position:0%
and have asked them similarly to provide
 
05:20:54.708 --> 05:20:54.718 align:start position:0%
a list of their requirements within the
 
05:20:56.208 --> 05:20:56.218 align:start position:0%
framework that you provided under the
 
05:20:58.550 --> 05:20:58.560 align:start position:0%
liquor community so okay everybody is on
 
05:21:03.830 --> 05:21:03.840 align:start position:0%

do people want to come in on Thursday
 
05:21:18.830 --> 05:21:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:20.810 --> 05:21:20.820 align:start position:0%
all right we're already here so what
 
05:21:22.490 --> 05:21:22.500 align:start position:0%
time what's the what's anybody has the
 
05:21:30.288 --> 05:21:30.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:35.350 --> 05:21:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:41.990 --> 05:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:44.570 --> 05:21:44.580 align:start position:0%
no Keith yeah that'll be quick the
 
05:21:47.628 --> 05:21:47.638 align:start position:0%
crypto it'll be quick okay so uh we'll
 
05:21:50.270 --> 05:21:50.280 align:start position:0%
schedule it we'll schedule it for 2 45
 
05:21:54.708 --> 05:21:54.718 align:start position:0%
we'll recess till 2 45 till tomorrow or
 
05:21:56.510 --> 05:21:56.520 align:start position:0%
yeah excuse me
 
05:21:56.520 --> 05:21:58.010 align:start position:0%
yeah excuse me
tomorrow

05:21:58.010 --> 05:21:58.020 align:start position:0%
tomorrow
 
05:22:00.530 --> 05:22:00.540 align:start position:0%
and in which case
 
05:22:04.910 --> 05:22:04.920 align:start position:0%
we'll hope to have uh taking
 
05:22:07.970 --> 05:22:07.980 align:start position:0%
from the amendment taking uh making the
 
05:22:10.850 --> 05:22:10.860 align:start position:0%
or excuse me from the original 649
 
05:22:13.910 --> 05:22:13.920 align:start position:0%
you'll take in the qualities of the
 
05:22:16.670 --> 05:22:16.680 align:start position:0%
amendment into that is that the
 
05:22:18.948 --> 05:22:18.958 align:start position:0%
versus the other way around what do you
 
05:22:21.170 --> 05:22:21.180 align:start position:0%
think Jason yes I think everyone
 
05:22:23.208 --> 05:22:23.218 align:start position:0%
understands we're trying to work within
 
05:22:24.890 --> 05:22:24.900 align:start position:0%
the framework of the Liquor Commission
 
05:22:27.850 --> 05:22:27.860 align:start position:0%
but we want to get all the results that
 
05:22:30.910 --> 05:22:30.920 align:start position:0%
we initially intended I've already
 
05:22:33.948 --> 05:22:33.958 align:start position:0%
talked with multiple people about the
 
05:22:35.628 --> 05:22:35.638 align:start position:0%
issues of Home growing annulment in
 
05:22:37.448 --> 05:22:37.458 align:start position:0%
particular that those are non-starters
 
05:22:39.530 --> 05:22:39.540 align:start position:0%
but they're they're very concerned
 
05:22:39.540 --> 05:22:40.910 align:start position:0%
but they're they're very concerned
around

05:22:40.910 --> 05:22:40.920 align:start position:0%
around
 
05:22:42.470 --> 05:22:42.480 align:start position:0%
um what Matt was just talking about the
 
05:22:44.810 --> 05:22:44.820 align:start position:0%
the independent testing what was the
 
05:22:47.750 --> 05:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
thing Advisory board and the um and just
 
05:22:49.670 --> 05:22:49.680 align:start position:0%
the the whole the flavor of the thing
 
05:22:52.010 --> 05:22:52.020 align:start position:0%
where we're just giving so much uh
 
05:22:53.448 --> 05:22:53.458 align:start position:0%
authority over the Liquor Commission
 
05:22:53.458 --> 05:22:54.890 align:start position:0%
authority over the Liquor Commission
without

05:22:54.890 --> 05:22:54.900 align:start position:0%
without
 
05:22:56.868 --> 05:22:56.878 align:start position:0%
any guidelines when we when we already
 
05:22:59.990 --> 05:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
have a bipartisan uh effort right now to
 
05:23:03.770 --> 05:23:03.780 align:start position:0%
try to range that in uh fortunately
 
05:23:05.270 --> 05:23:05.280 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission is being very well
 
05:23:07.850 --> 05:23:07.860 align:start position:0%
behaved at the moment some of these
 
05:23:11.288 --> 05:23:11.298 align:start position:0%
other agencies not not so much but
 
05:23:15.830 --> 05:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
okay so all right do you is it is your
 
05:23:17.810 --> 05:23:17.820 align:start position:0%
everybody's charge clear then
 
05:23:20.050 --> 05:23:20.060 align:start position:0%
uh so are you okay
 
05:23:22.070 --> 05:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman
 
05:23:22.080 --> 05:23:22.850 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman
um

05:23:22.850 --> 05:23:22.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:23:25.430 --> 05:23:25.440 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman are you asking that they
 
05:23:25.440 --> 05:23:26.510 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman are you asking that they
submit

05:23:26.510 --> 05:23:26.520 align:start position:0%
submit
 
05:23:29.330 --> 05:23:29.340 align:start position:0%
um their proposed changes by tomorrow or
 
05:23:37.330 --> 05:23:37.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:39.948 --> 05:23:39.958 align:start position:0%
okay so we'll start with the HHS what
 
05:23:42.890 --> 05:23:42.900 align:start position:0%
what is your concerns
 
05:23:46.250 --> 05:23:46.260 align:start position:0%
you have to come up to the mic sorry
 
05:23:52.070 --> 05:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:54.708 --> 05:23:54.718 align:start position:0%
we might need it tomorrow
 
05:23:56.330 --> 05:23:56.340 align:start position:0%
hello everybody my name is Michael Holt
 
05:23:57.708 --> 05:23:57.718 align:start position:0%
I'm the administrator of the therapeutic
 
05:23:58.910 --> 05:23:58.920 align:start position:0%
cannabis program within the Department
 
05:24:00.708 --> 05:24:00.718 align:start position:0%
of Health and Human Services Division of
 
05:24:02.810 --> 05:24:02.820 align:start position:0%
Public Health Services
 
05:24:05.570 --> 05:24:05.580 align:start position:0%
um my concerns are that I'm I've not
 
05:24:07.670 --> 05:24:07.680 align:start position:0%
been able to follow the uh where we've
 
05:24:07.680 --> 05:24:08.690 align:start position:0%
been able to follow the uh where we've
landed

05:24:08.690 --> 05:24:08.700 align:start position:0%
landed
 
05:24:11.090 --> 05:24:11.100 align:start position:0%
um uh and so I'm not sure which which
 
05:24:14.270 --> 05:24:14.280 align:start position:0%
bill was being amended in what way so
 
05:24:15.708 --> 05:24:15.718 align:start position:0%
that was my that I just have a general
 
05:24:17.810 --> 05:24:17.820 align:start position:0%
concern about not knowing the direction
 
05:24:20.208 --> 05:24:20.218 align:start position:0%
that's being uh that's being followed
 
05:24:20.218 --> 05:24:21.288 align:start position:0%
that's being uh that's being followed
here

05:24:21.288 --> 05:24:21.298 align:start position:0%
here
 
05:24:21.298 --> 05:24:22.150 align:start position:0%
here
um

05:24:22.150 --> 05:24:22.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:24:26.208 --> 05:24:26.218 align:start position:0%
639 is a thoughtful Coalition develop
 
05:24:30.110 --> 05:24:30.120 align:start position:0%
bill that is uh is uh creates a soft
 
05:24:32.628 --> 05:24:32.638 align:start position:0%
Landing for the atcs has social justice
 
05:24:35.930 --> 05:24:35.940 align:start position:0%
Provisions in it regarding annulment has
 
05:24:38.330 --> 05:24:38.340 align:start position:0%
an independent Advisory Board
 
05:24:41.390 --> 05:24:41.400 align:start position:0%
um has some has quite quite a bit of
 
05:24:42.830 --> 05:24:42.840 align:start position:0%
um pays quite a bit of attention to
 
05:24:44.330 --> 05:24:44.340 align:start position:0%
public health issues
 
05:24:44.340 --> 05:24:45.170 align:start position:0%
public health issues
so

05:24:45.170 --> 05:24:45.180 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:24:49.190 --> 05:24:49.200 align:start position:0%
639 is is generally a a good bill it's a
 
05:24:51.708 --> 05:24:51.718 align:start position:0%
good framework to to work on
 
05:24:54.230 --> 05:24:54.240 align:start position:0%
um the regulatory challenge I think is
 
05:24:57.170 --> 05:24:57.180 align:start position:0%
creating a new agency a cannabis
 
05:24:59.990 --> 05:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
commission out of whole cloth so what
 
05:25:02.510 --> 05:25:02.520 align:start position:0%
I'm hearing in this room is that the the
 
05:25:04.128 --> 05:25:04.138 align:start position:0%
there are people that want to give this
 
05:25:06.770 --> 05:25:06.780 align:start position:0%
responsibility not to a new commission
 
05:25:10.430 --> 05:25:10.440 align:start position:0%
but to The Liquor Commission to run I'd
 
05:25:12.708 --> 05:25:12.718 align:start position:0%
be interested in seeing a bill that
 
05:25:15.350 --> 05:25:15.360 align:start position:0%
replaces cannabis Commission
 
05:25:18.470 --> 05:25:18.480 align:start position:0%
in 639 with Liquor Commission and leaves
 
05:25:20.810 --> 05:25:20.820 align:start position:0%
everything else the same yeah and what
 
05:25:22.910 --> 05:25:22.920 align:start position:0%
is what does that bill look like
 
05:25:24.948 --> 05:25:24.958 align:start position:0%
um I I I'm not aware of what are
 
05:25:26.030 --> 05:25:26.040 align:start position:0%
non-staughters and what are not
 
05:25:27.590 --> 05:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
non-starters and I'm not saying that we
 
05:25:30.530 --> 05:25:30.540 align:start position:0%
you know you know HHS doesn't support or
 
05:25:31.970 --> 05:25:31.980 align:start position:0%
oppose legalization at this point we're
 
05:25:35.208 --> 05:25:35.218 align:start position:0%
neutral on it my interest is in the
 
05:25:37.670 --> 05:25:37.680 align:start position:0%
viability of maintaining
 
05:25:40.128 --> 05:25:40.138 align:start position:0%
um the therapeutic cannabis program the
 
05:25:43.550 --> 05:25:43.560 align:start position:0%
atcs and 639 has that structure in place
 
05:25:43.560 --> 05:25:44.930 align:start position:0%
atcs and 639 has that structure in place
that

05:25:44.930 --> 05:25:44.940 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:25:46.310 --> 05:25:46.320 align:start position:0%
um that
 
05:25:48.708 --> 05:25:48.718 align:start position:0%
that possibly does that
 
05:25:50.990 --> 05:25:51.000 align:start position:0%
um 544 does not
 
05:25:52.670 --> 05:25:52.680 align:start position:0%
um and the amendment that we've that we
 
05:25:54.288 --> 05:25:54.298 align:start position:0%
that we've been discussing does not
 
05:25:58.850 --> 05:25:58.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:01.128 --> 05:26:01.138 align:start position:0%
in in my opinion
 
05:26:03.770 --> 05:26:03.780 align:start position:0%
one option would be to
 
05:26:05.690 --> 05:26:05.700 align:start position:0%
pursue both bills
 
05:26:07.730 --> 05:26:07.740 align:start position:0%
your Amendment representative hunt to
 
05:26:10.270 --> 05:26:10.280 align:start position:0%
544 right
 
05:26:14.330 --> 05:26:14.340 align:start position:0%
on its own merits and see which one you
 
05:26:16.368 --> 05:26:16.378 align:start position:0%
know gets more traction in the house and
 
05:26:17.868 --> 05:26:17.878 align:start position:0%
then to the Senate and then with the
 
05:26:17.878 --> 05:26:18.830 align:start position:0%
then to the Senate and then with the
governor

05:26:18.830 --> 05:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
governor
 
05:26:21.470 --> 05:26:21.480 align:start position:0%
is there a way to make 639 more
 
05:26:24.170 --> 05:26:24.180 align:start position:0%
palatable to all those interests
 
05:26:27.288 --> 05:26:27.298 align:start position:0%
would that method be to replace
 
05:26:30.010 --> 05:26:30.020 align:start position:0%
cannabis commission a brand new agency
 
05:26:32.448 --> 05:26:32.458 align:start position:0%
with Liquor Commission
 
05:26:32.458 --> 05:26:34.190 align:start position:0%
with Liquor Commission
Maybe

05:26:34.190 --> 05:26:34.200 align:start position:0%
Maybe
 
05:26:36.110 --> 05:26:36.120 align:start position:0%
um but we haven't we haven't had that
 
05:26:37.910 --> 05:26:37.920 align:start position:0%
conversation you know what we have what
 
05:26:40.010 --> 05:26:40.020 align:start position:0%
we've had is you know let's get rid of
 
05:26:42.230 --> 05:26:42.240 align:start position:0%
all the good work in 639 let's replace
 
05:26:45.830 --> 05:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
it with a clone of 544.
 
05:26:45.840 --> 05:26:46.730 align:start position:0%
it with a clone of 544.
um

05:26:46.730 --> 05:26:46.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:26:48.170 --> 05:26:48.180 align:start position:0%
it doesn't make sense to me that we
 
05:26:52.250 --> 05:26:52.260 align:start position:0%
would use 639 as a uh as as a Liquor
 
05:26:54.170 --> 05:26:54.180 align:start position:0%
Commission Bill we should make forty
 
05:26:56.030 --> 05:26:56.040 align:start position:0%
five Forty Four The Liquor Commission
 
05:26:57.948 --> 05:26:57.958 align:start position:0%
bill you know okay and have them both
 
05:26:59.690 --> 05:26:59.700 align:start position:0%
have them both you know parallel tracks
 
05:27:01.788 --> 05:27:01.798 align:start position:0%
see what gets most traction the the only
 
05:27:03.230 --> 05:27:03.240 align:start position:0%
compromise that I can see if we only
 
05:27:06.708 --> 05:27:06.718 align:start position:0%
want one bill is what does 639 look like
 
05:27:08.690 --> 05:27:08.700 align:start position:0%
as is
 
05:27:11.628 --> 05:27:11.638 align:start position:0%
with Liquor Commission running it
 
05:27:14.390 --> 05:27:14.400 align:start position:0%
okay so that that's our goal is my my
 
05:27:15.948 --> 05:27:15.958 align:start position:0%
understanding that was the goal that
 
05:27:19.490 --> 05:27:19.500 align:start position:0%
we're going to try to change 639 to at
 
05:27:23.330 --> 05:27:23.340 align:start position:0%
least have the enforcement mechanism uh
 
05:27:25.610 --> 05:27:25.620 align:start position:0%
being The Liquor Commission
 
05:27:28.128 --> 05:27:28.138 align:start position:0%
is that agreed is everybody does anybody
 
05:27:29.930 --> 05:27:29.940 align:start position:0%
disagree if somebody disagreed check
 
05:27:31.190 --> 05:27:31.200 align:start position:0%
their head like this
 
05:27:33.410 --> 05:27:33.420 align:start position:0%
okay all right so I don't see anybody
 
05:27:36.230 --> 05:27:36.240 align:start position:0%
shaking their heads and then uh that has
 
05:27:37.730 --> 05:27:37.740 align:start position:0%
to be out of the committee so we don't
 
05:27:40.788 --> 05:27:40.798 align:start position:0%
even have to worry about 544 until the
 
05:27:43.850 --> 05:27:43.860 align:start position:0%
dust is settled once we where we're at
 
05:27:47.090 --> 05:27:47.100 align:start position:0%
when we take up 639 on the house floor
 
05:27:47.100 --> 05:27:49.910 align:start position:0%
when we take up 639 on the house floor
okay

05:27:49.910 --> 05:27:49.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:27:51.770 --> 05:27:51.780 align:start position:0%
all right so where direction is clearer
 
05:27:54.708 --> 05:27:54.718 align:start position:0%
yes now you're happy right now you're no
 
05:27:56.390 --> 05:27:56.400 align:start position:0%
I'm not I'm not happy I I'm not sure
 
05:27:57.948 --> 05:27:57.958 align:start position:0%
that the Liquor Commission is the best
 
05:27:59.930 --> 05:27:59.940 align:start position:0%
agency to be doing this right um but I
 
05:28:01.730 --> 05:28:01.740 align:start position:0%
also you know as a regulator you know
 
05:28:03.650 --> 05:28:03.660 align:start position:0%
with with Health and Human Services you
 
05:28:05.270 --> 05:28:05.280 align:start position:0%
know yeah it would be a challenge to
 
05:28:07.128 --> 05:28:07.138 align:start position:0%
create a brand new agency out of whole
 
05:28:09.288 --> 05:28:09.298 align:start position:0%
cloth and expect that this work is going
 
05:28:11.030 --> 05:28:11.040 align:start position:0%
to get done within the time frames
 
05:28:13.550 --> 05:28:13.560 align:start position:0%
contained within 6 6 39 right you know
 
05:28:15.948 --> 05:28:15.958 align:start position:0%
so I I see that as a at a place of
 
05:28:15.958 --> 05:28:16.970 align:start position:0%
so I I see that as a at a place of
compromise

05:28:16.970 --> 05:28:16.980 align:start position:0%
compromise
 
05:28:18.650 --> 05:28:18.660 align:start position:0%
um is it the best you know is it the
 
05:28:20.990 --> 05:28:21.000 align:start position:0%
best landing place I don't know that
 
05:28:22.910 --> 05:28:22.920 align:start position:0%
um so I
 
05:28:25.310 --> 05:28:25.320 align:start position:0%
I'm happy with the clarity you know is
 
05:28:28.070 --> 05:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
everybody clear everybody happy yes
 
05:28:28.080 --> 05:28:29.330 align:start position:0%
everybody clear everybody happy yes
yes okay

05:28:29.330 --> 05:28:29.340 align:start position:0%
yes okay
 
05:28:31.810 --> 05:28:31.820 align:start position:0%
yo yes
 
05:28:34.368 --> 05:28:34.378 align:start position:0%
thank you very much you have somebody
 
05:28:39.890 --> 05:28:39.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:42.230 --> 05:28:42.240 align:start position:0%
are you still a foot doctor you still do
 
05:28:45.830 --> 05:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:48.410 --> 05:28:48.420 align:start position:0%
all right thank you uh johannan former
 
05:28:50.750 --> 05:28:50.760 align:start position:0%
Commerce person I guess
 
05:28:53.570 --> 05:28:53.580 align:start position:0%
um I um I was part of the Coalition I'm
 
05:28:56.090 --> 05:28:56.100 align:start position:0%
not speaking for the Coalition uh I was
 
05:28:58.128 --> 05:28:58.138 align:start position:0%
also one of the people on the uh
 
05:28:59.930 --> 05:28:59.940 align:start position:0%
cannabis marijuana study commission back
 
05:29:01.910 --> 05:29:01.920 align:start position:0%
in 2018 that was the last large
 
05:29:04.368 --> 05:29:04.378 align:start position:0%
commission to study it uh another member
 
05:29:06.350 --> 05:29:06.360 align:start position:0%
of our Coalition is also was also on
 
05:29:08.270 --> 05:29:08.280 align:start position:0%
that and he and I Paul too and I were
 
05:29:09.650 --> 05:29:09.660 align:start position:0%
people that researched all the
 
05:29:11.628 --> 05:29:11.638 align:start position:0%
scientific literature to contribute to
 
05:29:13.670 --> 05:29:13.680 align:start position:0%
that study uh we talked to people back
 
05:29:16.190 --> 05:29:16.200 align:start position:0%
and this is what five six years ago we
 
05:29:17.990 --> 05:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
talked to people from everywhere that
 
05:29:20.390 --> 05:29:20.400 align:start position:0%
had legalized already and had tons of
 
05:29:21.770 --> 05:29:21.780 align:start position:0%
meetings with people about how to do it
 
05:29:24.110 --> 05:29:24.120 align:start position:0%
there wasn't a single person that left
 
05:29:26.030 --> 05:29:26.040 align:start position:0%
that commission thinking that the Laker
 
05:29:27.890 --> 05:29:27.900 align:start position:0%
commission was the best option and I
 
05:29:29.270 --> 05:29:29.280 align:start position:0%
even asked the liquor commissioner at
 
05:29:30.708 --> 05:29:30.718 align:start position:0%
the time I think was chairman Malika and
 
05:29:31.850 --> 05:29:31.860 align:start position:0%
some enforcement people that were there
 
05:29:34.010 --> 05:29:34.020 align:start position:0%
I commended them on making such a great
 
05:29:35.270 --> 05:29:35.280 align:start position:0%
amount of money for the State of New
 
05:29:36.650 --> 05:29:36.660 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they've made at that point I
 
05:29:38.270 --> 05:29:38.280 align:start position:0%
think it was three and a half almost 3.7
 
05:29:41.330 --> 05:29:41.340 align:start position:0%
billion dollars in 85 years for us
 
05:29:43.610 --> 05:29:43.620 align:start position:0%
um and uh they're one of the largest
 
05:29:44.868 --> 05:29:44.878 align:start position:0%
retailers in the country I think they're
 
05:29:46.610 --> 05:29:46.620 align:start position:0%
one of the top 10 largest retailers in
 
05:29:49.490 --> 05:29:49.500 align:start position:0%
the U.S for for alcohol
 
05:29:51.470 --> 05:29:51.480 align:start position:0%
I thought that was great and I said so
 
05:29:53.030 --> 05:29:53.040 align:start position:0%
if we want to sell as much cannabis as
 
05:29:54.170 --> 05:29:54.180 align:start position:0%
possible we should put it in the state
 
05:29:55.610 --> 05:29:55.620 align:start position:0%
stores or have the Liquor Commission be
 
05:29:57.470 --> 05:29:57.480 align:start position:0%
in charge of it and they were like you
 
05:29:59.868 --> 05:29:59.878 align:start position:0%
know not actually the the goal uh
 
05:30:01.010 --> 05:30:01.020 align:start position:0%
interestingly enough a few years ago
 
05:30:03.590 --> 05:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
chairman Malika said uh I don't remember
 
05:30:04.910 --> 05:30:04.920 align:start position:0%
where he said it but I can find out if
 
05:30:05.990 --> 05:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
you need to know
 
05:30:08.628 --> 05:30:08.638 align:start position:0%
our goal is to revitalize the brand the
 
05:30:10.430 --> 05:30:10.440 align:start position:0%
way you recognize Disney McDonald's or
 
05:30:13.070 --> 05:30:13.080 align:start position:0%
Walmart we want people to recognize us
 
05:30:16.190 --> 05:30:16.200 align:start position:0%
so if we put a cannabis leaf on the
 
05:30:19.368 --> 05:30:19.378 align:start position:0%
liquor commission's web on their brand
 
05:30:21.170 --> 05:30:21.180 align:start position:0%
how drastically is that going to change
 
05:30:23.570 --> 05:30:23.580 align:start position:0%
the liquor commission's brand uh is that
 
05:30:24.708 --> 05:30:24.718 align:start position:0%
the brand that New Hampshire actually
 
05:30:27.288 --> 05:30:27.298 align:start position:0%
wants to to have you know we've had
 
05:30:29.810 --> 05:30:29.820 align:start position:0%
prohibition of cannabis for so many
 
05:30:31.670 --> 05:30:31.680 align:start position:0%
years and now we're going to legalize it
 
05:30:33.170 --> 05:30:33.180 align:start position:0%
but the state's going to get most of the
 
05:30:35.208 --> 05:30:35.218 align:start position:0%
benefits the state will get benefits if
 
05:30:37.610 --> 05:30:37.620 align:start position:0%
there are other retailers the free
 
05:30:39.110 --> 05:30:39.120 align:start position:0%
market can provide I think better than
 
05:30:40.910 --> 05:30:40.920 align:start position:0%
even the state can in that regard the
 
05:30:42.170 --> 05:30:42.180 align:start position:0%
liquor commissions and I know the
 
05:30:43.250 --> 05:30:43.260 align:start position:0%
chairman is a big fan of the Liquor
 
05:30:44.570 --> 05:30:44.580 align:start position:0%
Commission model and we've had these
 
05:30:46.850 --> 05:30:46.860 align:start position:0%
discussions when I was here about who
 
05:30:48.890 --> 05:30:48.900 align:start position:0%
whose responsibility this should be in
 
05:30:50.868 --> 05:30:50.878 align:start position:0%
the beginning of probe after prohibition
 
05:30:52.670 --> 05:30:52.680 align:start position:0%
was repealed liquor commissions were
 
05:30:54.368 --> 05:30:54.378 align:start position:0%
instituted in States
 
05:30:57.230 --> 05:30:57.240 align:start position:0%
uh basically to discourage the purchases
 
05:30:58.610 --> 05:30:58.620 align:start position:0%
of alcoholic beverages by making it
 
05:31:00.470 --> 05:31:00.480 align:start position:0%
inconvenient as expensive as possible it
 
05:31:01.850 --> 05:31:01.860 align:start position:0%
wasn't so that we can get as much out
 
05:31:03.230 --> 05:31:03.240 align:start position:0%
there and make as much money for New
 
05:31:05.448 --> 05:31:05.458 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as possible it was to decrease
 
05:31:05.458 --> 05:31:07.190 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as possible it was to decrease
availability

05:31:07.190 --> 05:31:07.200 align:start position:0%
availability
 
05:31:09.530 --> 05:31:09.540 align:start position:0%
so we're going to put and and that was
 
05:31:11.030 --> 05:31:11.040 align:start position:0%
the goal at the time I can talk about
 
05:31:12.830 --> 05:31:12.840 align:start position:0%
Virginia the governor actually said we
 
05:31:14.990 --> 05:31:15.000 align:start position:0%
have to do something about it
 
05:31:17.330 --> 05:31:17.340 align:start position:0%
um you know it was considered a new
 
05:31:19.850 --> 05:31:19.860 align:start position:0%
weapon against this age-old evil it's
 
05:31:21.530 --> 05:31:21.540 align:start position:0%
become a big business even in New
 
05:31:22.788 --> 05:31:22.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that is not the goal anymore
 
05:31:24.770 --> 05:31:24.780 align:start position:0%
there is a good regulatory system in
 
05:31:26.510 --> 05:31:26.520 align:start position:0%
place I heard chairman give a speech at
 
05:31:27.708 --> 05:31:27.718 align:start position:0%
the opening of a liquor store in Epping
 
05:31:29.570 --> 05:31:29.580 align:start position:0%
when I was a State Rep it was about a
 
05:31:32.090 --> 05:31:32.100 align:start position:0%
responsible product for adult use and to
 
05:31:33.230 --> 05:31:33.240 align:start position:0%
you know all these different wonderful
 
05:31:35.208 --> 05:31:35.218 align:start position:0%
things if you replace the word cannabis
 
05:31:37.010 --> 05:31:37.020 align:start position:0%
for alcohol for cannabis it would have
 
05:31:39.350 --> 05:31:39.360 align:start position:0%
been the same speech I think legalizing
 
05:31:41.208 --> 05:31:41.218 align:start position:0%
it we all agree is the right option but
 
05:31:43.010 --> 05:31:43.020 align:start position:0%
who should be doing that the person
 
05:31:44.208 --> 05:31:44.218 align:start position:0%
that's going to be responsible for
 
05:31:46.368 --> 05:31:46.378 align:start position:0%
selling as much as possible or leave it
 
05:31:47.868 --> 05:31:47.878 align:start position:0%
to the free market and let people
 
05:31:49.368 --> 05:31:49.378 align:start position:0%
actually decide what they want where
 
05:31:50.570 --> 05:31:50.580 align:start position:0%
they want and how it's going to happen
 
05:31:52.310 --> 05:31:52.320 align:start position:0%
we can still have a cannabis control
 
05:31:54.890 --> 05:31:54.900 align:start position:0%
board having these uh discussions about
 
05:31:56.510 --> 05:31:56.520 align:start position:0%
you know selling to minors and
 
05:31:57.890 --> 05:31:57.900 align:start position:0%
advertising things like that similar to
 
05:32:00.890 --> 05:32:00.900 align:start position:0%
what the lyric commission does but
 
05:32:02.270 --> 05:32:02.280 align:start position:0%
um you know and like other people have
 
05:32:03.830 --> 05:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
said I'm not against it if that's the
 
05:32:05.270 --> 05:32:05.280 align:start position:0%
the deal breaker if it's only going to
 
05:32:07.310 --> 05:32:07.320 align:start position:0%
pass with the Liquor Commission uh being
 
05:32:09.050 --> 05:32:09.060 align:start position:0%
in charge of it I can get behind that
 
05:32:10.310 --> 05:32:10.320 align:start position:0%
but I don't think it's the preferred
 
05:32:13.250 --> 05:32:13.260 align:start position:0%
method uh for reasons I explained I mean
 
05:32:14.510 --> 05:32:14.520 align:start position:0%
if we want to sell as much as possible
 
05:32:16.910 --> 05:32:16.920 align:start position:0%
and make it our state brand
 
05:32:18.770 --> 05:32:18.780 align:start position:0%
um you know is that what we want to be
 
05:32:20.448 --> 05:32:20.458 align:start position:0%
known for as chairman Malika said like
 
05:32:22.250 --> 05:32:22.260 align:start position:0%
McDonald's or Walmart is you know New
 
05:32:26.448 --> 05:32:26.458 align:start position:0%
Hampshire alcohol and cannabis go for it
 
05:32:27.890 --> 05:32:27.900 align:start position:0%
um but I think there was another option
 
05:32:29.750 --> 05:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
I believe we should pass both bills
 
05:32:30.830 --> 05:32:30.840 align:start position:0%
through the house and see what happens
 
05:32:33.110 --> 05:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
if they both get to the Senate let them
 
05:32:34.250 --> 05:32:34.260 align:start position:0%
decide instead of worrying about what
 
05:32:35.930 --> 05:32:35.940 align:start position:0%
the Senate's going to do pass both
 
05:32:38.750 --> 05:32:38.760 align:start position:0%
options that's my personal opinion
 
05:32:38.760 --> 05:32:39.470 align:start position:0%
options that's my personal opinion
um

05:32:39.470 --> 05:32:39.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:32:39.480 --> 05:32:41.090 align:start position:0%
um
anyway

05:32:41.090 --> 05:32:41.100 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
05:32:42.530 --> 05:32:42.540 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to take questions I notice
 
05:32:43.970 --> 05:32:43.980 align:start position:0%
that hearing and taking me to go yeah
 
05:32:43.980 --> 05:32:47.868 align:start position:0%
that hearing and taking me to go yeah
thanks

05:32:47.868 --> 05:32:47.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:47.878 --> 05:32:51.770 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:32:51.770 --> 05:32:51.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:53.810 --> 05:32:53.820 align:start position:0%
remember we're not taking testimony here
 
05:32:57.350 --> 05:32:57.360 align:start position:0%
we're just here talking about the
 
05:32:57.360 --> 05:32:59.390 align:start position:0%
we're just here talking about the
yes

05:32:59.390 --> 05:32:59.400 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:33:01.670 --> 05:33:01.680 align:start position:0%
sorry Kate frying the vice president
 
05:33:04.128 --> 05:33:04.138 align:start position:0%
advocacy at new features I just want to
 
05:33:05.690 --> 05:33:05.700 align:start position:0%
be really clear we don't we're not
 
05:33:07.970 --> 05:33:07.980 align:start position:0%
picking with which side as far as who
 
05:33:10.368 --> 05:33:10.378 align:start position:0%
regulates it that's up to the
 
05:33:12.590 --> 05:33:12.600 align:start position:0%
legislature to decide we are looking at
 
05:33:15.230 --> 05:33:15.240 align:start position:0%
it totally as a public health approach
 
05:33:18.650 --> 05:33:18.660 align:start position:0%
to this so whatever model uh this
 
05:33:21.650 --> 05:33:21.660 align:start position:0%
committee um chooses to go forward with
 
05:33:23.448 --> 05:33:23.458 align:start position:0%
we have to ensure that there's
 
05:33:25.070 --> 05:33:25.080 align:start position:0%
protections for Children and Youth
 
05:33:27.350 --> 05:33:27.360 align:start position:0%
promoting social justice opportunities
 
05:33:29.750 --> 05:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
and Equity protecting public health and
 
05:33:32.030 --> 05:33:32.040 align:start position:0%
population health and ensuring that the
 
05:33:34.128 --> 05:33:34.138 align:start position:0%
funding from Cannabis Revenue goes to
 
05:33:37.430 --> 05:33:37.440 align:start position:0%
direct to reduce harms so there's some
 
05:33:41.810 --> 05:33:41.820 align:start position:0%
of that in 6 30 uh 639 it doesn't go far
 
05:33:44.030 --> 05:33:44.040 align:start position:0%
enough there's some of that in the
 
05:33:46.010 --> 05:33:46.020 align:start position:0%
amendment I think that you had at one
 
05:33:48.770 --> 05:33:48.780 align:start position:0%
point that doesn't go far enough and
 
05:33:51.230 --> 05:33:51.240 align:start position:0%
there's some of that in HB 544 I can
 
05:33:53.030 --> 05:33:53.040 align:start position:0%
provide you the language that meets all
 
05:33:55.010 --> 05:33:55.020 align:start position:0%
of these principles and in the meantime
 
05:33:56.390 --> 05:33:56.400 align:start position:0%
I believe I passed this out in the
 
05:33:58.550 --> 05:33:58.560 align:start position:0%
committee but just so you have it it has
 
05:34:00.410 --> 05:34:00.420 align:start position:0%
our principles what what's in the bill
 
05:34:02.990 --> 05:34:03.000 align:start position:0%
and what the resolution is to meet those
 
05:34:05.150 --> 05:34:05.160 align:start position:0%
principles I think that's a great thing
 
05:34:06.288 --> 05:34:06.298 align:start position:0%
to pass out
 
05:34:08.570 --> 05:34:08.580 align:start position:0%
okay since uh I get to have the last
 
05:34:10.850 --> 05:34:10.860 align:start position:0%
word the only thing I would like to
 
05:34:15.050 --> 05:34:15.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:25.190 --> 05:34:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:28.788 --> 05:34:28.798 align:start position:0%
room temperature change or whatever but
 
05:34:31.610 --> 05:34:31.620 align:start position:0%
um my name is Heather Marie Brown I am
 
05:34:34.128 --> 05:34:34.138 align:start position:0%
the patient representative on the
 
05:34:36.050 --> 05:34:36.060 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis medical oversight
 
05:34:36.060 --> 05:34:37.490 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis medical oversight
board

05:34:37.490 --> 05:34:37.500 align:start position:0%
board
 
05:34:39.830 --> 05:34:39.840 align:start position:0%
um so although the medical oversight
 
05:34:41.930 --> 05:34:41.940 align:start position:0%
board didn't necessarily take a position
 
05:34:45.110 --> 05:34:45.120 align:start position:0%
as far as whether we would support any
 
05:34:47.410 --> 05:34:47.420 align:start position:0%
specific legalization Bill
 
05:34:51.948 --> 05:34:51.958 align:start position:0%
what we did decide is that we're not
 
05:34:54.788 --> 05:34:54.798 align:start position:0%
okay with any bill that's going to
 
05:34:57.770 --> 05:34:57.780 align:start position:0%
jeopardize the therapeutic cannabis
 
05:35:00.708 --> 05:35:00.718 align:start position:0%
program for our patients
 
05:35:02.690 --> 05:35:02.700 align:start position:0%
um you know I think representative hunt
 
05:35:06.110 --> 05:35:06.120 align:start position:0%
you did an absolutely wonderful job with
 
05:35:08.750 --> 05:35:08.760 align:start position:0%
your amendment I would dare say that you
 
05:35:11.330 --> 05:35:11.340 align:start position:0%
should probably have just submitted that
 
05:35:14.208 --> 05:35:14.218 align:start position:0%
has a entire bill on its own it's that
 
05:35:16.670 --> 05:35:16.680 align:start position:0%
in depth as far as being the largest
 
05:35:19.850 --> 05:35:19.860 align:start position:0%
Amendment I've ever seen thanks but
 
05:35:19.860 --> 05:35:20.510 align:start position:0%
Amendment I've ever seen thanks but
um

05:35:20.510 --> 05:35:20.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:35:23.690 --> 05:35:23.700 align:start position:0%
I I do not I think that's an important
 
05:35:26.750 --> 05:35:26.760 align:start position:0%
aspect is unfortunately your Amendment
 
05:35:30.288 --> 05:35:30.298 align:start position:0%
doesn't include that it doesn't protect
 
05:35:34.010 --> 05:35:34.020 align:start position:0%
the therapeutic cannabis program it
 
05:35:37.490 --> 05:35:37.500 align:start position:0%
doesn't protect the patients uh if our
 
05:35:40.610 --> 05:35:40.620 align:start position:0%
atcs go out of business then our
 
05:35:43.910 --> 05:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
patients have no place to go where they
 
05:35:47.208 --> 05:35:47.218 align:start position:0%
can receive the education the guidance
 
05:35:50.690 --> 05:35:50.700 align:start position:0%
and the safety and the quality and
 
05:35:52.250 --> 05:35:52.260 align:start position:0%
everything else that comes along with
 
05:35:55.128 --> 05:35:55.138 align:start position:0%
being part of the program so I just ask
 
05:35:57.948 --> 05:35:57.958 align:start position:0%
that the group remember that in the back
 
05:35:59.868 --> 05:35:59.878 align:start position:0%
of their minds as they're going through
 
05:36:02.810 --> 05:36:02.820 align:start position:0%
and picking and choosing and piecing and
 
05:36:05.628 --> 05:36:05.638 align:start position:0%
gluing and you know hopefully that that
 
05:36:09.948 --> 05:36:09.958 align:start position:0%
is made to be a important factor moving
 
05:36:12.230 --> 05:36:12.240 align:start position:0%
forward no matter how you choose to
 
05:36:13.910 --> 05:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
decide to move forward
 
05:36:16.670 --> 05:36:16.680 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much
 
05:36:19.610 --> 05:36:19.620 align:start position:0%
okay so as I was saying since I get to
 
05:36:21.410 --> 05:36:21.420 align:start position:0%
have the last word
 
05:36:23.948 --> 05:36:23.958 align:start position:0%
um the only thing I would urge everyone
 
05:36:26.810 --> 05:36:26.820 align:start position:0%
to keep in their minds
 
05:36:29.090 --> 05:36:29.100 align:start position:0%
is that the Liquor Commission has
 
05:36:30.890 --> 05:36:30.900 align:start position:0%
another task
 
05:36:34.850 --> 05:36:34.860 align:start position:0%
and yes I did write the the law I wasn't
 
05:36:38.090 --> 05:36:38.100 align:start position:0%
it was done a scitex uh bill but I'm the
 
05:36:40.550 --> 05:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
one who fixed it it amended it and got
 
05:36:44.510 --> 05:36:44.520 align:start position:0%
it passed uh and that is that it also
 
05:36:47.208 --> 05:36:47.218 align:start position:0%
does tobacco
 
05:36:50.448 --> 05:36:50.458 align:start position:0%
and if you look at the model that I did
 
05:36:54.830 --> 05:36:54.840 align:start position:0%
it is very much like our tobacco stature
 
05:36:57.530 --> 05:36:57.540 align:start position:0%
so uh as much as you want to throw
 
05:37:00.050 --> 05:37:00.060 align:start position:0%
liquor and say this marijuana has
 
05:37:02.150 --> 05:37:02.160 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with liquor I want you to
 
05:37:05.750 --> 05:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
reread that Amendment and think tobacco
 
05:37:07.430 --> 05:37:07.440 align:start position:0%
and what's the difference between
 
05:37:09.850 --> 05:37:09.860 align:start position:0%
tobacco and marijuana I guess maybe
 
05:37:13.368 --> 05:37:13.378 align:start position:0%
tobacco is not fresh I don't know it's
 
05:37:16.970 --> 05:37:16.980 align:start position:0%
uh but um I I just want everybody to
 
05:37:19.310 --> 05:37:19.320 align:start position:0%
know that when I was working this model
 
05:37:23.448 --> 05:37:23.458 align:start position:0%
it was how in the new the new model now
 
05:37:27.110 --> 05:37:27.120 align:start position:0%
as it's as as you see it is it's the
 
05:37:28.368 --> 05:37:28.378 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission is not doing anything
 
05:37:30.470 --> 05:37:30.480 align:start position:0%
different than what it does now for
 
05:37:33.470 --> 05:37:33.480 align:start position:0%
tobacco and even Kate knows that and she
 
05:37:35.390 --> 05:37:40.690 align:start position:0%
doesn't like cigarettes
 
05:37:40.690 --> 05:37:40.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:43.970 --> 05:37:43.980 align:start position:0%
oh the indoor smoking part yes right no
 
05:37:45.770 --> 05:37:45.780 align:start position:0%
I I still think restaurants should be
 
05:37:47.530 --> 05:37:47.540 align:start position:0%
able to have smoking if they want to but
 
05:37:51.590 --> 05:37:51.600 align:start position:0%
but I'm pro-choice okay with that we
 
05:37:53.690 --> 05:37:53.700 align:start position:0%
will adjourn and we'll be see you all
 
05:37:58.190 --> 05:37:58.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:05.090 --> 05:38:05.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:08.090 --> 05:38:08.100 align:start position:0%
so we're in the house tomorrow yeah 10.
 
05:38:10.810 --> 05:38:10.820 align:start position:0%
in the morning
 
05:38:13.448 --> 05:38:13.458 align:start position:0%
oh wait do we have a yes
 
05:38:16.368 --> 05:38:16.378 align:start position:0%
yeah I'll be there
 
05:38:18.050 --> 05:38:18.060 align:start position:0%
yes we're on our own committee room
 
05:38:18.060 --> 05:38:19.250 align:start position:0%
yes we're on our own committee room
tomorrow

05:38:19.250 --> 05:38:19.260 align:start position:0%
tomorrow
 
05:38:24.470 --> 05:38:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:25.910 --> 05:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
because otherwise I have to write it
 
05:38:25.920 --> 05:38:45.490 align:start position:0%
because otherwise I have to write it
myself

05:38:45.490 --> 05:38:45.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:07.368 --> 05:39:07.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:07.378 --> 05:39:26.708 align:start position:0%
 
technology

05:39:26.708 --> 05:39:26.718 align:start position:0%
