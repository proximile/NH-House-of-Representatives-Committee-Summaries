00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:15.000 align:start position:0%
good morning I'm going to call together
 
00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
the um subcommittee on um House Bill
 
00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:22.600 align:start position:0%
1573 and I'm going to start by calling
 
00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:24.800 align:start position:0%
on um Christa
 
00:11:28.389 --> 00:11:28.399 align:start position:0%
Morris and um is Chris are you going to
 
00:11:29.829 --> 00:11:29.839 align:start position:0%
have anyone else from the department
 
00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:31.600 align:start position:0%
join you or
 
00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:35.600 align:start position:0%
just okay just fine uh and we do have a
 
00:11:38.389 --> 00:11:38.399 align:start position:0%
new Amendment and I've ask her to go
 
00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:41.800 align:start position:0%
through that Amendment and um we have a
 
00:11:44.389 --> 00:11:44.399 align:start position:0%
nice side by side which will be really
 
00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:47.800 align:start position:0%
helpful for us thank you yes uh thank
 
00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:49.240 align:start position:0%
you and I don't know if you need my name
 
00:11:51.269 --> 00:11:51.279 align:start position:0%
but it's Christa Morris I'm with DHHS as
 
00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:52.720 align:start position:0%
the Director of intergovernmental
 
00:11:57.310 --> 00:11:57.320 align:start position:0%
Affairs um as you can tell hb1 1573 was
 
00:11:59.829 --> 00:11:59.839 align:start position:0%
a bit complicated and so what we had to
 
00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:02.920 align:start position:0%
do as I explained to you earlier um some
 
00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:05.440 align:start position:0%
of the Amendments or some of the changes
 
00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
in this amendment were merely a copy
 
00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:11.120 align:start position:0%
paste issue with um all the back and
 
00:12:13.829 --> 00:12:13.839 align:start position:0%
forth with the OCA we had a lot of edits
 
00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:15.440 align:start position:0%
a lot of track changes and so when
 
00:12:17.269 --> 00:12:17.279 align:start position:0%
things copy pasted over they didn't get
 
00:12:19.629 --> 00:12:19.639 align:start position:0%
in so there are a few items in here that
 
00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:21.920 align:start position:0%
that are that um and then there were
 
00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
other changes that we worked with OCA on
 
00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:26.880 align:start position:0%
to make technical amendments um just
 
00:12:28.629 --> 00:12:28.639 align:start position:0%
kind of clarifying some language making
 
00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:31.040 align:start position:0%
sure that the intent matches the
 
00:12:32.509 --> 00:12:32.519 align:start position:0%
language or the language matches the
 
00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:35.160 align:start position:0%
intent of the bill and then on top of
 
00:12:38.629 --> 00:12:38.639 align:start position:0%
that we um added some language regarding
 
00:12:40.829 --> 00:12:40.839 align:start position:0%
uh Juvenile Justice from
 
00:12:45.629 --> 00:12:45.639 align:start position:0%
jrpg they had some edits just kind of
 
00:12:48.030 --> 00:12:48.040 align:start position:0%
again word smithing changing some words
 
00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
to meet the federal um requirements and
 
00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:52.680 align:start position:0%
I'll go through them line by line I just
 
00:12:55.189 --> 00:12:55.199 align:start position:0%
wanted to give a high high level and
 
00:12:57.670 --> 00:12:57.680 align:start position:0%
then also there are some edits uh as
 
00:12:59.310 --> 00:12:59.320 align:start position:0%
charged by representative Edwards
 
00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:03.160 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson to try to uh
 
00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:07.160 align:start position:0%
reduce the number of visits or anything
 
00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
make changes that would possibly reduce
 
00:13:11.550 --> 00:13:11.560 align:start position:0%
the fiscal impact to the department and
 
00:13:13.389 --> 00:13:13.399 align:start position:0%
so all of those changes are in this
 
00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:14.880 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment and we will go
 
00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:17.000 align:start position:0%
through the six pages and just kind of
 
00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
highlight some of those
 
00:13:21.269 --> 00:13:21.279 align:start position:0%
okay thank
 
00:13:25.509 --> 00:13:25.519 align:start position:0%
you all right so first we have strike
 
00:13:27.509 --> 00:13:27.519 align:start position:0%
qualified qualified residential
 
00:13:30.189 --> 00:13:30.199 align:start position:0%
treatment program um I think I explained
 
00:13:32.470 --> 00:13:32.480 align:start position:0%
that last time that was just for some
 
00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:37.480 align:start position:0%
facilities apply to be a qrtp qrtp yes
 
00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:39.800 align:start position:0%
um make sure I got those letters correct
 
00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:43.120 align:start position:0%
uh when you use letters would you would
 
00:13:46.069 --> 00:13:46.079 align:start position:0%
you tell us what they stand for sure so
 
00:13:47.629 --> 00:13:47.639 align:start position:0%
the qualified residential treatment
 
00:13:50.269 --> 00:13:50.279 align:start position:0%
program we removed the queue from the
 
00:13:53.550 --> 00:13:53.560 align:start position:0%
qrtp and that's only because that is a
 
00:13:57.670 --> 00:13:57.680 align:start position:0%
federal uh designation if a facility
 
00:13:59.590 --> 00:13:59.600 align:start position:0%
wants to apply for federal
 
00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:02.720 align:start position:0%
uh title for foster care funding they
 
00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:05.680 align:start position:0%
have to go through the qrtp process some
 
00:14:07.949 --> 00:14:07.959 align:start position:0%
states do not engage in that process so
 
00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:10.480 align:start position:0%
their their facilities in the state
 
00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:13.000 align:start position:0%
wouldn't apply to be a qrtp doesn't mean
 
00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:15.240 align:start position:0%
that that's a lower quality program it's
 
00:14:18.389 --> 00:14:18.399 align:start position:0%
just a a funding mechanism title
 
00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:20.560 align:start position:0%
essentially so we went through to make
 
00:14:22.269 --> 00:14:22.279 align:start position:0%
sure that that didn't reduce the number
 
00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
of facilities that we could send
 
00:14:26.670 --> 00:14:26.680 align:start position:0%
children to and so we just wanted to
 
00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:28.040 align:start position:0%
make sure that that was lined out
 
00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:29.870 align:start position:0%
make sure that that was lined out
correctly

00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:29.880 align:start position:0%
correctly
 
00:14:34.949 --> 00:14:34.959 align:start position:0%
so next if you go to section one part
 
00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:38.320 align:start position:0%
two that is under purpose and statements
 
00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:41.240 align:start position:0%
so that's going to obviously have a zero
 
00:14:46.949 --> 00:14:46.959 align:start position:0%
impact um it is some rewarding to again
 
00:14:51.509 --> 00:14:51.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:54.430 --> 00:14:54.440 align:start position:0%
sorry as um Miss Morris is going through
 
00:14:56.710 --> 00:14:56.720 align:start position:0%
this uh because I've not seen this it
 
00:14:59.430 --> 00:14:59.440 align:start position:0%
would be good if you could just give us
 
00:15:02.269 --> 00:15:02.279 align:start position:0%
pause so I can read it before she starts
 
00:15:05.949 --> 00:15:05.959 align:start position:0%
to explain it MH yep I can do that real
 
00:15:05.959 --> 00:15:27.749 align:start position:0%
to explain it MH yep I can do that real
working

00:15:27.749 --> 00:15:27.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:30.749 --> 00:15:30.759 align:start position:0%
okay okay so again that's where we are
 
00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:32.920 align:start position:0%
making sure that the language uh
 
00:15:35.949 --> 00:15:35.959 align:start position:0%
reflects the intent of the bill prior uh
 
00:15:39.389 --> 00:15:39.399 align:start position:0%
it it it was a broader statement so it
 
00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:41.360 align:start position:0%
included many more youth placed in
 
00:15:42.990 --> 00:15:43.000 align:start position:0%
residential facilities including those
 
00:15:44.629 --> 00:15:44.639 align:start position:0%
that are voluntary youth you know their
 
00:15:46.949 --> 00:15:46.959 align:start position:0%
parents send them versus the state and
 
00:15:48.749 --> 00:15:48.759 align:start position:0%
so we wanted to make sure that this is
 
00:15:51.069 --> 00:15:51.079 align:start position:0%
intended for children under the care of
 
00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:53.600 align:start position:0%
the state and so that's why those
 
00:15:57.230 --> 00:15:57.240 align:start position:0%
specific rsas are labeled in this bill
 
00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:08.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:19.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:22.680 align:start position:0%
yeah so to understand the context of
 
00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:24.600 align:start position:0%
this question let let me tell you where
 
00:16:27.629 --> 00:16:27.639 align:start position:0%
I'm coming from um The Epiphany I had
 
00:16:30.949 --> 00:16:30.959 align:start position:0%
the other day of about that whatever we
 
00:16:34.590 --> 00:16:34.600 align:start position:0%
put into this law uh will open the state
 
00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:38.120 align:start position:0%
up to lawsuit if we don't comply with it
 
00:16:41.710 --> 00:16:41.720 align:start position:0%
uh has has just got me thinking that uh
 
00:16:45.309 --> 00:16:45.319 align:start position:0%
we should uh try where we can to make
 
00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
distinctions between uh shall and may uh
 
00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:52.040 align:start position:0%
like later we're going to talk about
 
00:16:56.269 --> 00:16:56.279 align:start position:0%
visits um and you know uh when we get to
 
00:16:59.670 --> 00:16:59.680 align:start position:0%
that if it's a it's a we we shall do X
 
00:17:05.590 --> 00:17:05.600 align:start position:0%
number I'm I'm wondering if we do um uh
 
00:17:09.069 --> 00:17:09.079 align:start position:0%
we shall do a x which is a lower number
 
00:17:11.949 --> 00:17:11.959 align:start position:0%
with an aspirational goal or we may do
 
00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:16.480 align:start position:0%
as many as four so that there's shs that
 
00:17:19.630 --> 00:17:19.640 align:start position:0%
set it down and ma that will will
 
00:17:22.110 --> 00:17:22.120 align:start position:0%
definitely aim at from a budget
 
00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:25.640 align:start position:0%
perspective in this instance on line
 
00:17:30.029 --> 00:17:30.039 align:start position:0%
seven we use the word insure and ensure
 
00:17:33.669 --> 00:17:33.679 align:start position:0%
feels like a good word to sue us because
 
00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:37.880 align:start position:0%
if we don't and and and because it says
 
00:17:40.789 --> 00:17:40.799 align:start position:0%
appropriate appropri we ensure
 
00:17:43.630 --> 00:17:43.640 align:start position:0%
appropriate appropriate is a poorly
 
00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:47.600 align:start position:0%
defined word and is subject to the
 
00:17:50.710 --> 00:17:50.720 align:start position:0%
Judgment of a you potentially a jury or
 
00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
a judge right so so I'm I'm
 
00:17:55.789 --> 00:17:55.799 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable with the combination of
 
00:17:58.029 --> 00:17:58.039 align:start position:0%
those two words in this sentence Ure
 
00:17:58.039 --> 00:17:59.390 align:start position:0%
those two words in this sentence Ure
appropriate

00:17:59.390 --> 00:17:59.400 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:02.400 align:start position:0%
so that's an observation Madam chair
 
00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:03.909 align:start position:0%
so that's an observation Madam chair
thank

00:18:03.909 --> 00:18:03.919 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:18:07.230 --> 00:18:07.240 align:start position:0%
you and so that's one of those where I
 
00:18:09.909 --> 00:18:09.919 align:start position:0%
noticed today on the Gen Court website
 
00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:12.400 align:start position:0%
there are multiple dates for this bill
 
00:18:15.070 --> 00:18:15.080 align:start position:0%
so um my goal is after today going
 
00:18:17.669 --> 00:18:17.679 align:start position:0%
through this with you that these edits
 
00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:19.360 align:start position:0%
these recommendations you make I will go
 
00:18:21.390 --> 00:18:21.400 align:start position:0%
back with the OCA and and work out to
 
00:18:24.909 --> 00:18:24.919 align:start position:0%
see what we can what we can do and and
 
00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:26.960 align:start position:0%
of course that's just my opinion and and
 
00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee would have to
 
00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
take a position but that that's just my
 
00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:34.640 align:start position:0%
personal first blush yeah let's let's
 
00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:37.480 align:start position:0%
continue on with going through it and we
 
00:18:39.669 --> 00:18:39.679 align:start position:0%
do want to get the response from um the
 
00:18:42.029 --> 00:18:42.039 align:start position:0%
office of The troud Advocate and from
 
00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:44.480 align:start position:0%
and from the court around um what they
 
00:18:46.669 --> 00:18:46.679 align:start position:0%
see here and then we'll work on
 
00:18:48.669 --> 00:18:48.679 align:start position:0%
wordsmithing it right yeah that's what I
 
00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:51.480 align:start position:0%
me even though we love to
 
00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:55.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:59.470 --> 00:18:59.480 align:start position:0%
so next we have section one Roman
 
00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:02.710 align:start position:0%
so next we have section one Roman
four

00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:02.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:04.990 --> 00:19:05.000 align:start position:0%
and so this is where I'm going to call
 
00:19:07.029 --> 00:19:07.039 align:start position:0%
in the OCA a little
 
00:19:09.669 --> 00:19:09.679 align:start position:0%
bit some of these are your edits from
 
00:19:09.679 --> 00:19:10.430 align:start position:0%
bit some of these are your edits from
the

00:19:10.430 --> 00:19:10.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:19:13.149 --> 00:19:13.159 align:start position:0%
jrpg and so I can't speak to those as
 
00:19:13.159 --> 00:19:16.270 align:start position:0%
jrpg and so I can't speak to those as
well

00:19:16.270 --> 00:19:16.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:18.029 --> 00:19:18.039 align:start position:0%
unfortunately sorry I should have called
 
00:19:20.149 --> 00:19:20.159 align:start position:0%
you up here to begin
 
00:19:20.159 --> 00:19:27.710 align:start position:0%
you up here to begin
with

00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:27.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:57.789 align:start position:0%
 
yep

00:19:57.789 --> 00:19:57.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:00.590 --> 00:20:00.600 align:start position:0%
so if I could just nothing in this
 
00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
finding section is a substantive change
 
00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:05.240 align:start position:0%
in policy from what already passed
 
00:20:07.909 --> 00:20:07.919 align:start position:0%
through the house like Christa mentioned
 
00:20:11.230 --> 00:20:11.240 align:start position:0%
a little bit was just word smithing here
 
00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:15.440 align:start position:0%
we added just two one partial sentence
 
00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:18.640 align:start position:0%
in lines 12 and 13 a shortage or lack of
 
00:20:20.669 --> 00:20:20.679 align:start position:0%
foster family homes or community- based
 
00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:22.440 align:start position:0%
resources shall not be an acceptable
 
00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:24.080 align:start position:0%
reason for placement in a residential
 
00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:26.760 align:start position:0%
facility and that just helps this align
 
00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:28.480 align:start position:0%
with the other pieces of the bill this
 
00:20:31.390 --> 00:20:31.400 align:start position:0%
is mentioned other places so we just
 
00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure that was upfront in
 
00:20:35.909 --> 00:20:35.919 align:start position:0%
the purpose and findings um and that
 
00:20:37.669 --> 00:20:37.679 align:start position:0%
also aligns with some some federal
 
00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
standards that you cannot put kids in a
 
00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:41.640 align:start position:0%
more restrictive placement because a
 
00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:43.240 align:start position:0%
residential facility is the most
 
00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
restrictive placement just because you
 
00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:48.240 align:start position:0%
have failed to provide less restrictive
 
00:20:49.669 --> 00:20:49.679 align:start position:0%
resources so that really was just kind
 
00:20:52.669 --> 00:20:52.679 align:start position:0%
of aligning the language throughout the
 
00:20:56.510 --> 00:20:56.520 align:start position:0%
bill so this is a 1 a and 1B question
 
00:20:58.750 --> 00:20:58.760 align:start position:0%
when you say there's no policy changes
 
00:21:01.110 --> 00:21:01.120 align:start position:0%
and from what the house has done do do
 
00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:03.080 align:start position:0%
you do you mean I I just want to be
 
00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
clear we're not talking about the
 
00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:07.600 align:start position:0%
current law we're talking about what
 
00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:11.120 align:start position:0%
passed in 1573 previously as the as a
 
00:21:14.430 --> 00:21:14.440 align:start position:0%
kind of a new policy correct okay in in
 
00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:16.760 align:start position:0%
in this finding section so we are in
 
00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:19.080 align:start position:0%
fact changing policy in order to get the
 
00:21:22.510 --> 00:21:22.520 align:start position:0%
numbers to work so so um so we're going
 
00:21:25.230 --> 00:21:25.240 align:start position:0%
to probably break some eggs along the
 
00:21:27.710 --> 00:21:27.720 align:start position:0%
way here from what the house has already
 
00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:29.240 align:start position:0%
passed as my guess
 
00:21:31.149 --> 00:21:31.159 align:start position:0%
so the B part of
 
00:21:36.669 --> 00:21:36.679 align:start position:0%
this is um as a as a person who has
 
00:21:40.789 --> 00:21:40.799 align:start position:0%
worked in the real world if a shortage
 
00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:43.480 align:start position:0%
of a resource if there is a shortage of
 
00:21:47.710 --> 00:21:47.720 align:start position:0%
a resource it does obviously impact the
 
00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:51.200 align:start position:0%
decisions that get made and so um
 
00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:53.840 align:start position:0%
without understanding the stronger
 
00:21:55.950 --> 00:21:55.960 align:start position:0%
context to this the fact that we're
 
00:21:59.190 --> 00:21:59.200 align:start position:0%
saying a shortage or lack of Foster
 
00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:01.440 align:start position:0%
family homes or community-based
 
00:22:03.870 --> 00:22:03.880 align:start position:0%
resources shall not be an acceptable
 
00:22:06.310 --> 00:22:06.320 align:start position:0%
reason I I I think by definition it
 
00:22:09.390 --> 00:22:09.400 align:start position:0%
becomes an acceptable reason to come to
 
00:22:11.390 --> 00:22:11.400 align:start position:0%
an alternative because you have no
 
00:22:15.149 --> 00:22:15.159 align:start position:0%
resources so I I my my first instinct
 
00:22:18.149 --> 00:22:18.159 align:start position:0%
would just be to strike that subp
 
00:22:22.110 --> 00:22:22.120 align:start position:0%
paragraph what do you en sub paragraph
 
00:22:25.870 --> 00:22:25.880 align:start position:0%
no no no from where it says a shortage
 
00:22:28.990 --> 00:22:29.000 align:start position:0%
to the end where it says in a
 
00:22:31.470 --> 00:22:31.480 align:start position:0%
residential facility I think shortages
 
00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:34.760 align:start position:0%
are the real world and matter and I
 
00:22:37.830 --> 00:22:37.840 align:start position:0%
think that a shortage of foster family
 
00:22:40.950 --> 00:22:40.960 align:start position:0%
homes or Community Resources is not a
 
00:22:42.549 --> 00:22:42.559 align:start position:0%
reason to take a
 
00:22:45.630 --> 00:22:45.640 align:start position:0%
child's um freedoms and place them in a
 
00:22:47.669 --> 00:22:47.679 align:start position:0%
very restriced facility that is intended
 
00:22:56.830 --> 00:22:56.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:59.149 --> 00:22:59.159 align:start position:0%
use if you don't have something you
 
00:23:03.070 --> 00:23:03.080 align:start position:0%
can't use it that that seems fairly
 
00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:05.440 align:start position:0%
obvious absolutely understandable that
 
00:23:07.590 --> 00:23:07.600 align:start position:0%
the the shortage of resources does lead
 
00:23:10.230 --> 00:23:10.240 align:start position:0%
to needing to take a look at alternative
 
00:23:11.909 --> 00:23:11.919 align:start position:0%
placement options or we're saying here
 
00:23:13.549 --> 00:23:13.559 align:start position:0%
is there's a difference between getting
 
00:23:15.149 --> 00:23:15.159 align:start position:0%
creative with an alternative placement
 
00:23:17.590 --> 00:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
option and putting a child in a setting
 
00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:20.080 align:start position:0%
that is considered highly restrictive as
 
00:23:22.830 --> 00:23:22.840 align:start position:0%
Lissa mentioned is the entire intention
 
00:23:24.590 --> 00:23:24.600 align:start position:0%
of these facilities is to be providing a
 
00:23:26.630 --> 00:23:26.640 align:start position:0%
therapeutic treatment and if that child
 
00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:28.000 align:start position:0%
isn't in need of that therapeutic
 
00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:30.480 align:start position:0%
treatment what are they gaining by being
 
00:23:31.950 --> 00:23:31.960 align:start position:0%
in that facility and it could actually
 
00:23:33.870 --> 00:23:33.880 align:start position:0%
become much more harmful and research
 
00:23:35.789 --> 00:23:35.799 align:start position:0%
tells us can lead to more problematic
 
00:23:37.669 --> 00:23:37.679 align:start position:0%
Behavior down the line if children
 
00:23:39.470 --> 00:23:39.480 align:start position:0%
aren't in an appropriate setting from
 
00:23:41.470 --> 00:23:41.480 align:start position:0%
the beginning of placement so so I don't
 
00:23:43.070 --> 00:23:43.080 align:start position:0%
have a problem with anything you just
 
00:23:45.750 --> 00:23:45.760 align:start position:0%
said other than this is written in the
 
00:23:48.909 --> 00:23:48.919 align:start position:0%
negative this is saying Thou shalt not
 
00:23:51.789 --> 00:23:51.799 align:start position:0%
and if you have a a good alternative
 
00:23:54.510 --> 00:23:54.520 align:start position:0%
when we do not have these resources
 
00:23:57.950 --> 00:23:57.960 align:start position:0%
could we write what a good alternative
 
00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:00.600 align:start position:0%
would be so that we have uh an
 
00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:03.720 align:start position:0%
affirmative direction to go instead of
 
00:24:07.230 --> 00:24:07.240 align:start position:0%
um a reduction to a negative statement
 
00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:09.480 align:start position:0%
the reason excuse me the reason an
 
00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
alternative has not been provided in
 
00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:14.400 align:start position:0%
writing here is we do not want to lock
 
00:24:16.350 --> 00:24:16.360 align:start position:0%
them into one and only one option
 
00:24:19.310 --> 00:24:19.320 align:start position:0%
alternative it is constantly evolving
 
00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:21.480 align:start position:0%
the director of DCF has been getting
 
00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
very creative around children where who
 
00:24:25.870 --> 00:24:25.880 align:start position:0%
are coming into care where there is not
 
00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:27.240 align:start position:0%
an option for placement and is not
 
00:24:28.750 --> 00:24:28.760 align:start position:0%
immediately going to residential coming
 
00:24:30.909 --> 00:24:30.919 align:start position:0%
up with other creative options maybe
 
00:24:32.430 --> 00:24:32.440 align:start position:0%
adding additional services in other
 
00:24:34.230 --> 00:24:34.240 align:start position:0%
areas to have a child plac there so
 
00:24:36.070 --> 00:24:36.080 align:start position:0%
we're trying not to give them a one only
 
00:24:38.389 --> 00:24:38.399 align:start position:0%
option we're trying to allow them the
 
00:24:41.710 --> 00:24:41.720 align:start position:0%
freedom saying we can't move this child
 
00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:44.080 align:start position:0%
to that restrictive setting but you have
 
00:24:45.470 --> 00:24:45.480 align:start position:0%
the freedom to come up with other
 
00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
creative options and that's constantly
 
00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:50.520 align:start position:0%
evolving currently month by month we're
 
00:24:52.630 --> 00:24:52.640 align:start position:0%
having new um Alternatives that we're
 
00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:54.480 align:start position:0%
that the state agency is coming up with
 
00:24:56.269 --> 00:24:56.279 align:start position:0%
to get creative around placement of
 
00:24:57.950 --> 00:24:57.960 align:start position:0%
children and I would also just point out
 
00:25:01.149 --> 00:25:01.159 align:start position:0%
since we are in finance um residential
 
00:25:03.789 --> 00:25:03.799 align:start position:0%
facilities are exponentially more
 
00:25:07.630 --> 00:25:07.640 align:start position:0%
expensive per day than any other type of
 
00:25:09.149 --> 00:25:09.159 align:start position:0%
placement as well as I I heard you
 
00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
mentioned liability earlier you know you
 
00:25:14.669 --> 00:25:14.679 align:start position:0%
do open yourself up when you're putting
 
00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:16.640 align:start position:0%
children in placements that are not
 
00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:18.080 align:start position:0%
appropriate for them that are more
 
00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:20.880 align:start position:0%
restrictive that are traumatic for them
 
00:25:23.909 --> 00:25:23.919 align:start position:0%
so I I think and also part of the word
 
00:25:25.870 --> 00:25:25.880 align:start position:0%
smithing was this is language that
 
00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:28.640 align:start position:0%
aligns with current federal Court
 
00:25:31.909 --> 00:25:31.919 align:start position:0%
standards about placement of children um
 
00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:34.640 align:start position:0%
so as well as Federal funding the family
 
00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:36.600 align:start position:0%
first Prevention Services act which
 
00:25:38.510 --> 00:25:38.520 align:start position:0%
provides funding to the states if
 
00:25:40.750 --> 00:25:40.760 align:start position:0%
they're utilizing Residential Care
 
00:25:41.909 --> 00:25:41.919 align:start position:0%
appropriately then they can receive
 
00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
additional funding to to miss sanz's
 
00:25:47.710 --> 00:25:47.720 align:start position:0%
point about there being creativity and
 
00:25:49.909 --> 00:25:49.919 align:start position:0%
Alternatives and some smart things we
 
00:25:53.789 --> 00:25:53.799 align:start position:0%
can do uh there's nothing uh in this
 
00:25:57.230 --> 00:25:57.240 align:start position:0%
paragraph from lines 10 to 18 that are
 
00:26:01.389 --> 00:26:01.399 align:start position:0%
suggestive of what might be done in lie
 
00:26:04.789 --> 00:26:04.799 align:start position:0%
of in in the presence of a shortage and
 
00:26:07.029 --> 00:26:07.039 align:start position:0%
and if we could have some language in
 
00:26:11.149 --> 00:26:11.159 align:start position:0%
here uh to explain what sort of
 
00:26:13.470 --> 00:26:13.480 align:start position:0%
Alternatives or thought process would be
 
00:26:16.470 --> 00:26:16.480 align:start position:0%
appropriate I think that would be useful
 
00:26:18.789 --> 00:26:18.799 align:start position:0%
to the to the
 
00:26:21.630 --> 00:26:21.640 align:start position:0%
bill your words were great they're just
 
00:26:27.230 --> 00:26:27.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:31.110 --> 00:26:31.120 align:start position:0%
saying I think they heard what you were
 
00:26:33.710 --> 00:26:33.720 align:start position:0%
saying and let's move on maybe Christa
 
00:26:36.310 --> 00:26:36.320 align:start position:0%
can move to the next section
 
00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:39.360 align:start position:0%
sure so next if you on the amendment
 
00:26:44.549 --> 00:26:44.559 align:start position:0%
line 19 Section one room and numeral 6
 
00:26:47.350 --> 00:26:47.360 align:start position:0%
uh I believe this was more word smithing
 
00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:48.909 align:start position:0%
uh I believe this was more word smithing
to

00:26:48.909 --> 00:26:48.919 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:26:51.990 --> 00:26:52.000 align:start position:0%
align time out read
 
00:26:57.230 --> 00:26:57.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:57.240 --> 00:27:27.149 align:start position:0%
 
that

00:27:27.149 --> 00:27:27.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:27.159 --> 00:27:49.149 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:27:49.149 --> 00:27:49.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:49.159 --> 00:27:51.630 align:start position:0%
 
ready

00:27:51.630 --> 00:27:51.640 align:start position:0%
ready
 
00:27:54.509 --> 00:27:54.519 align:start position:0%
okay we'll come back to that one oh
 
00:27:56.310 --> 00:27:56.320 align:start position:0%
we're going to come back to that one
 
00:27:58.630 --> 00:27:58.640 align:start position:0%
okay because I'm going through copy
 
00:27:59.789 --> 00:27:59.799 align:start position:0%
pasted so I'm
 
00:28:01.830 --> 00:28:01.840 align:start position:0%
wondering sorry if I could I think it
 
00:28:04.430 --> 00:28:04.440 align:start position:0%
adds and oversight process the first
 
00:28:06.509 --> 00:28:06.519 align:start position:0%
sentence y thank you I think we're a
 
00:28:11.470 --> 00:28:11.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:15.360 align:start position:0%
just so the modifications is line 21 it
 
00:28:23.590 --> 00:28:23.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:25.549 --> 00:28:25.559 align:start position:0%
okay and
 
00:28:27.789 --> 00:28:27.799 align:start position:0%
let's I think we've got that one let's
 
00:28:30.830 --> 00:28:30.840 align:start position:0%
move move on to the next session oh you
 
00:28:33.310 --> 00:28:33.320 align:start position:0%
have't okay representative Edwards has a
 
00:28:36.110 --> 00:28:36.120 align:start position:0%
question thank you madam chair so on
 
00:28:39.110 --> 00:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
line 26 we specifically say effective 6
 
00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:42.480 align:start position:0%
months later and uh is is it the
 
00:28:45.990 --> 00:28:46.000 align:start position:0%
Department's position that creating the
 
00:28:49.310 --> 00:28:49.320 align:start position:0%
job descriptions creating the structure
 
00:28:52.350 --> 00:28:52.360 align:start position:0%
doing the hiring the availability of
 
00:28:55.230 --> 00:28:55.240 align:start position:0%
potential Workforce that all of those
 
00:28:57.710 --> 00:28:57.720 align:start position:0%
factors that go go into building this
 
00:29:00.909 --> 00:29:00.919 align:start position:0%
can be done in six
 
00:29:03.669 --> 00:29:03.679 align:start position:0%
months if we work really hard it could
 
00:29:06.430 --> 00:29:06.440 align:start position:0%
happen in six months um I spoke to our
 
00:29:08.430 --> 00:29:08.440 align:start position:0%
finance so right now um governor and
 
00:29:09.830 --> 00:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
council is going on so our Chief
 
00:29:11.990 --> 00:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
Financial Officer Nate naan he's over
 
00:29:14.789 --> 00:29:14.799 align:start position:0%
there he will come over here afterward
 
00:29:17.149 --> 00:29:17.159 align:start position:0%
um but he explained you know between
 
00:29:19.310 --> 00:29:19.320 align:start position:0%
getting through Das or you know to get a
 
00:29:22.149 --> 00:29:22.159 align:start position:0%
position number to get it posted to get
 
00:29:23.470 --> 00:29:23.480 align:start position:0%
all of those
 
00:29:26.310 --> 00:29:26.320 align:start position:0%
steps we might have someone hired in six
 
00:29:29.110 --> 00:29:29.120 align:start position:0%
months yeah because I'm I'm still
 
00:29:32.430 --> 00:29:32.440 align:start position:0%
paranoid about the litigation potential
 
00:29:35.870 --> 00:29:35.880 align:start position:0%
and and so I I would be more comfortable
 
00:29:40.149 --> 00:29:40.159 align:start position:0%
with a a kind of an uh
 
00:29:47.230 --> 00:29:47.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:49.870 --> 00:29:49.880 align:start position:0%
date if I may respond to that from from
 
00:29:51.990 --> 00:29:52.000 align:start position:0%
the OC excuse me from the OCA
 
00:29:54.190 --> 00:29:54.200 align:start position:0%
perspective um we do understand it will
 
00:29:56.269 --> 00:29:56.279 align:start position:0%
take additional positions to fulfill
 
00:29:58.070 --> 00:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
this fully but there are positions that
 
00:30:00.750 --> 00:30:00.760 align:start position:0%
currently exist that are in this role so
 
00:30:02.350 --> 00:30:02.360 align:start position:0%
they need additional positions but there
 
00:30:04.669 --> 00:30:04.679 align:start position:0%
are folks about two or three that are
 
00:30:06.909 --> 00:30:06.919 align:start position:0%
already doing the certification so it's
 
00:30:08.509 --> 00:30:08.519 align:start position:0%
not that you're building a completely
 
00:30:10.350 --> 00:30:10.360 align:start position:0%
new division you're adding bodies to the
 
00:30:13.630 --> 00:30:13.640 align:start position:0%
division which over time um can be done
 
00:30:15.269 --> 00:30:15.279 align:start position:0%
and I do believe that six Monon time
 
00:30:17.190 --> 00:30:17.200 align:start position:0%
frame is achievable for that and then it
 
00:30:18.710 --> 00:30:18.720 align:start position:0%
will just add to the number of them that
 
00:30:21.549 --> 00:30:21.559 align:start position:0%
can get out and see these facilities we
 
00:30:24.870 --> 00:30:24.880 align:start position:0%
also disagree about the number of
 
00:30:28.230 --> 00:30:28.240 align:start position:0%
positions necessary frankly in this this
 
00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:30.720 align:start position:0%
bill the way it is currently written the
 
00:30:32.870 --> 00:30:32.880 align:start position:0%
OCA believes that two to three positions
 
00:30:34.789 --> 00:30:34.799 align:start position:0%
in BCB should cover it there should not
 
00:30:37.389 --> 00:30:37.399 align:start position:0%
need to be any more positions in dcyf
 
00:30:39.630 --> 00:30:39.640 align:start position:0%
related to monthly visits we haven't
 
00:30:41.310 --> 00:30:41.320 align:start position:0%
really gotten to talk to the court in
 
00:30:45.230 --> 00:30:45.240 align:start position:0%
depth but we and this is why we came
 
00:30:49.149 --> 00:30:49.159 align:start position:0%
that we believe that the request is far
 
00:30:51.350 --> 00:30:51.360 align:start position:0%
overreaching and really truly
 
00:30:54.710 --> 00:30:54.720 align:start position:0%
unnecessary to even meet what was passed
 
00:30:57.990 --> 00:30:58.000 align:start position:0%
in the house um and so we we did
 
00:30:59.509 --> 00:30:59.519 align:start position:0%
disagree that there would need to be any
 
00:31:01.789 --> 00:31:01.799 align:start position:0%
additional time the six months should be
 
00:31:03.269 --> 00:31:03.279 align:start position:0%
enough to build out two or three more
 
00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
positions in bcbh um and I hear uh
 
00:31:08.549 --> 00:31:08.559 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards your concerns
 
00:31:08.559 --> 00:31:09.509 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards your concerns
about

00:31:09.509 --> 00:31:09.519 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:31:13.190 --> 00:31:13.200 align:start position:0%
liability from a legal standpoint and I
 
00:31:15.029 --> 00:31:15.039 align:start position:0%
have been an attorney for dcyf as well
 
00:31:16.669 --> 00:31:16.679 align:start position:0%
as a parent side attorney so I've done
 
00:31:19.070 --> 00:31:19.080 align:start position:0%
both sides of this work I think the
 
00:31:21.750 --> 00:31:21.760 align:start position:0%
release of the bledo report in all the
 
00:31:24.470 --> 00:31:24.480 align:start position:0%
conversations that have occurred last
 
00:31:28.110 --> 00:31:28.120 align:start position:0%
summer last fall at the policy
 
00:31:30.669 --> 00:31:30.679 align:start position:0%
committees in both the House and Senate
 
00:31:32.509 --> 00:31:32.519 align:start position:0%
there's already a liability issue
 
00:31:34.310 --> 00:31:34.320 align:start position:0%
because the frankly the division is
 
00:31:36.710 --> 00:31:36.720 align:start position:0%
really already required to do almost
 
00:31:39.669 --> 00:31:39.679 align:start position:0%
everything that is in this bill already
 
00:31:41.990 --> 00:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
and it was not being done to the
 
00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:44.960 align:start position:0%
standard that was protecting children so
 
00:31:46.830 --> 00:31:46.840 align:start position:0%
I hear your concerns about liability but
 
00:31:48.110 --> 00:31:48.120 align:start position:0%
I think just having had these
 
00:31:50.750 --> 00:31:50.760 align:start position:0%
conversations that liability is already
 
00:31:54.070 --> 00:31:54.080 align:start position:0%
there now thank you so so I can
 
00:31:56.110 --> 00:31:56.120 align:start position:0%
appreciate that but I'm not going to
 
00:31:58.549 --> 00:31:58.559 align:start position:0%
contribute to making it easy here for
 
00:32:02.029 --> 00:32:02.039 align:start position:0%
somebody to go go against the state with
 
00:32:04.710 --> 00:32:04.720 align:start position:0%
by putting it into law uh I I I'm I
 
00:32:09.070 --> 00:32:09.080 align:start position:0%
don't want to do that so
 
00:32:13.789 --> 00:32:13.799 align:start position:0%
um okay go ahead yeah thank you so much
 
00:32:19.669 --> 00:32:19.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:23.750 --> 00:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
okay so the last row on page one starts
 
00:32:25.669 --> 00:32:25.679 align:start position:0%
on line 29 of the
 
00:32:28.590 --> 00:32:28.600 align:start position:0%
amendment and that
 
00:32:32.389 --> 00:32:32.399 align:start position:0%
was so there is an well the addition was
 
00:32:35.590 --> 00:32:35.600 align:start position:0%
already passed we are removing a
 
00:32:37.669 --> 00:32:37.679 align:start position:0%
strikeout and I'll let you read that but
 
00:32:56.830 --> 00:32:56.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:56.840 --> 00:33:08.149 align:start position:0%
 
exemption

00:33:08.149 --> 00:33:08.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:10.629 --> 00:33:10.639 align:start position:0%
so so is it so in effect does this make
 
00:33:14.789 --> 00:33:14.799 align:start position:0%
it easier to uh for the state to find a
 
00:33:14.799 --> 00:33:19.430 align:start position:0%
it easier to uh for the state to find a
placement

00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:23.310 --> 00:33:23.320 align:start position:0%
option no I don't believe so this this
 
00:33:25.149 --> 00:33:25.159 align:start position:0%
came from our chief legal officer that
 
00:33:28.350 --> 00:33:28.360 align:start position:0%
she did not want that struck out um and
 
00:33:30.590 --> 00:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
it what it's an exemption from
 
00:33:33.110 --> 00:33:33.120 align:start position:0%
inspections so if we if we have to do
 
00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:36.960 align:start position:0%
fewer inspections uh doesn't it follow
 
00:33:40.549 --> 00:33:40.559 align:start position:0%
then that it it's easier for us to find
 
00:33:42.710 --> 00:33:42.720 align:start position:0%
an alternative facility because we don't
 
00:33:45.710 --> 00:33:45.720 align:start position:0%
have to subject it to an inspection
 
00:33:47.950 --> 00:33:47.960 align:start position:0%
process that that that's I'm wondering
 
00:33:50.070 --> 00:33:50.080 align:start position:0%
what the Practical implication of
 
00:33:53.149 --> 00:33:53.159 align:start position:0%
removing that as a strike out
 
00:33:55.990 --> 00:33:56.000 align:start position:0%
is honestly from our point of view we
 
00:33:58.230 --> 00:33:58.240 align:start position:0%
felt that the new bold
 
00:34:00.750 --> 00:34:00.760 align:start position:0%
language at the end of that paragraph
 
00:34:02.830 --> 00:34:02.840 align:start position:0%
created the same requirements that's why
 
00:34:04.509 --> 00:34:04.519 align:start position:0%
that other piece was struck out I know
 
00:34:07.789 --> 00:34:07.799 align:start position:0%
dcyf legal disagreed and I I would defer
 
00:34:11.310 --> 00:34:11.320 align:start position:0%
to them but I I believe we are chief you
 
00:34:14.950 --> 00:34:14.960 align:start position:0%
guys have so many titles Chief legal I
 
00:34:16.710 --> 00:34:16.720 align:start position:0%
understand they they felt but I think
 
00:34:18.829 --> 00:34:18.839 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the new bold language was
 
00:34:22.230 --> 00:34:22.240 align:start position:0%
to capture those same sort of oversight
 
00:34:23.629 --> 00:34:23.639 align:start position:0%
there was just in different statutes
 
00:34:25.750 --> 00:34:25.760 align:start position:0%
based on what was newly written but I I
 
00:34:28.750 --> 00:34:28.760 align:start position:0%
believe it should be similar it was just
 
00:34:30.750 --> 00:34:30.760 align:start position:0%
spreading the duty across because some
 
00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:56.630 --> 00:34:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:56.640 --> 00:35:16.750 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:35:16.750 --> 00:35:16.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:19.030 --> 00:35:19.040 align:start position:0%
so I will explain this one real quickly
 
00:35:21.870 --> 00:35:21.880 align:start position:0%
to you on line seven of page two that
 
00:35:24.870 --> 00:35:24.880 align:start position:0%
was originally RSA 170 and we changed it
 
00:35:27.950 --> 00:35:27.960 align:start position:0%
to one uh the department feels it it
 
00:35:31.069 --> 00:35:31.079 align:start position:0%
fits better under 169 and so that's why
 
00:35:39.670 --> 00:35:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:55.270 --> 00:35:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:58.670 --> 00:35:58.680 align:start position:0%
well good okay so then next we have
 
00:36:01.069 --> 00:36:01.079 align:start position:0%
section three Roman 1 and that starts on
 
00:36:08.790 --> 00:36:08.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:12.790 --> 00:36:12.800 align:start position:0%
two this is ensuring and it again it's I
 
00:36:14.589 --> 00:36:14.599 align:start position:0%
think this is more word smithing it's
 
00:36:18.069 --> 00:36:18.079 align:start position:0%
making sure that any program does not
 
00:36:19.990 --> 00:36:20.000 align:start position:0%
receive funding from us if they are not
 
00:36:21.790 --> 00:36:21.800 align:start position:0%
certified and that we do not send
 
00:36:23.630 --> 00:36:23.640 align:start position:0%
children there if they are not
 
00:36:26.589 --> 00:36:26.599 align:start position:0%
certified it's and it's just some word
 
00:36:28.750 --> 00:36:28.760 align:start position:0%
smithing to make sure that that aligns
 
00:36:31.910 --> 00:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
the the facility must you
 
00:36:35.870 --> 00:36:35.880 align:start position:0%
know meet the requirements so it also
 
00:36:38.430 --> 00:36:38.440 align:start position:0%
clarifies that all facilities where
 
00:36:40.109 --> 00:36:40.119 align:start position:0%
children are placed must also be
 
00:36:41.829 --> 00:36:41.839 align:start position:0%
licensed if they're in New Hampshire
 
00:36:43.630 --> 00:36:43.640 align:start position:0%
they're licensed under New Hampshire
 
00:36:46.470 --> 00:36:46.480 align:start position:0%
170e if they're out of state they're
 
00:36:48.190 --> 00:36:48.200 align:start position:0%
still required to be licensed but it's
 
00:36:50.430 --> 00:36:50.440 align:start position:0%
by that State's licensing body so that
 
00:36:53.950 --> 00:36:53.960 align:start position:0%
clarification it also took out um outof
 
00:36:56.630 --> 00:36:56.640 align:start position:0%
State programs and just made any program
 
00:36:58.030 --> 00:36:58.040 align:start position:0%
because it doesn't matter if they're in
 
00:36:59.829 --> 00:36:59.839 align:start position:0%
state or out of state they need to be
 
00:37:01.309 --> 00:37:01.319 align:start position:0%
licensed and they need to be certified
 
00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:02.640 align:start position:0%
so that was just a little bit of cleanup
 
00:37:06.030 --> 00:37:06.040 align:start position:0%
language there so so that's intentional
 
00:37:10.990 --> 00:37:11.000 align:start position:0%
going from 13 to 14 where it uh says by
 
00:37:12.910 --> 00:37:12.920 align:start position:0%
the department so there's no other
 
00:37:15.390 --> 00:37:15.400 align:start position:0%
certification alternative other than the
 
00:37:18.550 --> 00:37:18.560 align:start position:0%
state doing the certification which is
 
00:37:20.109 --> 00:37:20.119 align:start position:0%
current law that's intentional correct
 
00:37:24.750 --> 00:37:24.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:27.710 --> 00:37:27.720 align:start position:0%
thanks so then next it says new two
 
00:37:30.270 --> 00:37:30.280 align:start position:0%
sections three Roman numeral 2 and three
 
00:37:32.190 --> 00:37:32.200 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral 3 that's where I explained
 
00:37:35.190 --> 00:37:35.200 align:start position:0%
earlier there was a track changes copy
 
00:37:37.870 --> 00:37:37.880 align:start position:0%
paste error I just needed to add those
 
00:37:42.470 --> 00:37:42.480 align:start position:0%
sections back in to the law
 
00:37:45.790 --> 00:37:45.800 align:start position:0%
um it creates a new certification team
 
00:37:48.030 --> 00:37:48.040 align:start position:0%
which is what we were discussing earlier
 
00:37:50.230 --> 00:37:50.240 align:start position:0%
as well as we shall develop a standard
 
00:37:52.870 --> 00:37:52.880 align:start position:0%
operating procedure and a form that we
 
00:37:54.790 --> 00:37:54.800 align:start position:0%
will consult with the child
 
00:37:57.030 --> 00:37:57.040 align:start position:0%
advocate um and this is what I spoke to
 
00:37:57.950 --> 00:37:57.960 align:start position:0%
I think
 
00:38:00.870 --> 00:38:00.880 align:start position:0%
some of you before uh we have invited
 
00:38:03.829 --> 00:38:03.839 align:start position:0%
the OCA to Shadow us on visits for
 
00:38:06.910 --> 00:38:06.920 align:start position:0%
certification and DCF visits so that way
 
00:38:09.790 --> 00:38:09.800 align:start position:0%
they can um kind of see what we do but
 
00:38:11.829 --> 00:38:11.839 align:start position:0%
then also provide feedback if there's
 
00:38:13.510 --> 00:38:13.520 align:start position:0%
anything they want us to add to our
 
00:38:15.430 --> 00:38:15.440 align:start position:0%
checklist add to what we look at during
 
00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:26.430 align:start position:0%
checklist add to what we look at during
those

00:38:26.430 --> 00:38:26.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:34.109 align:start position:0%
 
visits

00:38:34.109 --> 00:38:34.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:38.630 --> 00:38:38.640 align:start position:0%
so on line 25 of page two this is now
 
00:38:41.309 --> 00:38:41.319 align:start position:0%
section 4 it was previously three Roman
 
00:38:41.319 --> 00:38:43.390 align:start position:0%
section 4 it was previously three Roman
numeral

00:38:43.390 --> 00:38:43.400 align:start position:0%
numeral
 
00:38:46.150 --> 00:38:46.160 align:start position:0%
2 this is again I believe just kind of
 
00:38:48.670 --> 00:38:48.680 align:start position:0%
expanding some of the language priorly
 
00:38:51.109 --> 00:38:51.119 align:start position:0%
mentioned or priorly is that a word
 
00:38:54.030 --> 00:38:54.040 align:start position:0%
mentioned prior um regarding just
 
00:38:57.190 --> 00:38:57.200 align:start position:0%
ensuring that the facility is licensed
 
00:38:59.550 --> 00:38:59.560 align:start position:0%
and in their own State and that they are
 
00:39:01.550 --> 00:39:01.560 align:start position:0%
Li in an instate facility they are
 
00:39:03.230 --> 00:39:03.240 align:start position:0%
licensed by us and that everyone is
 
00:39:07.550 --> 00:39:07.560 align:start position:0%
certified by us and that's not a change
 
00:39:09.349 --> 00:39:09.359 align:start position:0%
that this is it's the same as what was
 
00:39:11.990 --> 00:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
passed by the house in
 
00:39:15.630 --> 00:39:15.640 align:start position:0%
February so question there uh is there
 
00:39:18.510 --> 00:39:18.520 align:start position:0%
is there a break glass option on this if
 
00:39:20.510 --> 00:39:20.520 align:start position:0%
we really need to do a placement and we
 
00:39:21.950 --> 00:39:21.960 align:start position:0%
don't have time to complete the
 
00:39:24.990 --> 00:39:25.000 align:start position:0%
certification is there an emergency
 
00:39:27.470 --> 00:39:27.480 align:start position:0%
workaround I believe our team dis
 
00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:28.710 align:start position:0%
workaround I believe our team dis
batches

00:39:28.710 --> 00:39:28.720 align:start position:0%
batches
 
00:39:31.990 --> 00:39:32.000 align:start position:0%
emergency uh staff to go and quickly
 
00:39:34.670 --> 00:39:34.680 align:start position:0%
certify a facility before placing a
 
00:39:36.750 --> 00:39:36.760 align:start position:0%
child there so we never send a child
 
00:39:38.550 --> 00:39:38.560 align:start position:0%
that is to a facility that is not
 
00:39:40.950 --> 00:39:40.960 align:start position:0%
previously certified it just may happen
 
00:39:43.870 --> 00:39:43.880 align:start position:0%
in short order our team dispatches I
 
00:39:46.030 --> 00:39:46.040 align:start position:0%
don't know same day next day and they go
 
00:39:47.710 --> 00:39:47.720 align:start position:0%
and and certify it before we send a
 
00:39:50.109 --> 00:39:50.119 align:start position:0%
child there because we cannot pay them
 
00:39:52.470 --> 00:39:52.480 align:start position:0%
unless they are a certified facility
 
00:39:54.870 --> 00:39:54.880 align:start position:0%
they are not going to take our child
 
00:39:56.630 --> 00:39:56.640 align:start position:0%
without knowing that they're going to
 
00:39:58.430 --> 00:39:58.440 align:start position:0%
get paid for it thanks that's a complete
 
00:40:01.550 --> 00:40:01.560 align:start position:0%
answer thank you and just to add to that
 
00:40:03.589 --> 00:40:03.599 align:start position:0%
since we were talking about lack of
 
00:40:05.790 --> 00:40:05.800 align:start position:0%
resources there are a number of
 
00:40:07.950 --> 00:40:07.960 align:start position:0%
facilities currently that are certified
 
00:40:09.510 --> 00:40:09.520 align:start position:0%
and do not have any children placed in
 
00:40:11.950 --> 00:40:11.960 align:start position:0%
them so in an emergency they have beds
 
00:40:13.230 --> 00:40:13.240 align:start position:0%
that are already certified that they
 
00:40:15.030 --> 00:40:15.040 align:start position:0%
have the ability to outreach and utilize
 
00:40:23.190 --> 00:40:23.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:27.309 --> 00:40:27.319 align:start position:0%
yeah all right so next we have on start
 
00:40:30.190 --> 00:40:30.200 align:start position:0%
starting on line 32 of page two now
 
00:40:32.870 --> 00:40:32.880 align:start position:0%
section Roman numeral 5 what was
 
00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:35.430 align:start position:0%
section Roman numeral 5 what was
previously

00:40:35.430 --> 00:40:35.440 align:start position:0%
previously
 
00:40:38.550 --> 00:40:38.560 align:start position:0%
three so this is where I know the OCA
 
00:40:40.550 --> 00:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
will not agree with this is the attempt
 
00:40:43.550 --> 00:40:43.560 align:start position:0%
to reduce the requir uh the visit
 
00:40:46.270 --> 00:40:46.280 align:start position:0%
requirements from four times per year to
 
00:40:49.470 --> 00:40:49.480 align:start position:0%
at least two per year and I say at least
 
00:40:51.870 --> 00:40:51.880 align:start position:0%
so that way our staff also has that
 
00:40:54.309 --> 00:40:54.319 align:start position:0%
flexibility if I call it their Spidey
 
00:40:57.030 --> 00:40:57.040 align:start position:0%
senses start going off they can go back
 
00:41:00.550 --> 00:41:00.560 align:start position:0%
and do another facility visit um and one
 
00:41:02.270 --> 00:41:02.280 align:start position:0%
of those visits so one will be the
 
00:41:04.230 --> 00:41:04.240 align:start position:0%
regular certification visit and then the
 
00:41:06.069 --> 00:41:06.079 align:start position:0%
other one will be unannounced to the
 
00:41:09.750 --> 00:41:09.760 align:start position:0%
facility it will be a Popin spot check
 
00:41:12.670 --> 00:41:12.680 align:start position:0%
well but broader than a check
 
00:41:15.750 --> 00:41:15.760 align:start position:0%
yeah and presently they're doing they're
 
00:41:18.390 --> 00:41:18.400 align:start position:0%
required to do one one per year yes so
 
00:41:20.829 --> 00:41:20.839 align:start position:0%
this doubles it doubles what is
 
00:41:22.470 --> 00:41:22.480 align:start position:0%
currently being done but it cuts it in
 
00:41:24.870 --> 00:41:24.880 align:start position:0%
half by what was recommended um and this
 
00:41:26.950 --> 00:41:26.960 align:start position:0%
would obviously reduce the fiscal impact
 
00:41:29.670 --> 00:41:29.680 align:start position:0%
by that but then also again gives us
 
00:41:31.109 --> 00:41:31.119 align:start position:0%
that flexibility to go out more
 
00:41:33.950 --> 00:41:33.960 align:start position:0%
frequently than just to if needed thank
 
00:41:38.270 --> 00:41:38.280 align:start position:0%
you represent uh thank you uh so would
 
00:41:42.150 --> 00:41:42.160 align:start position:0%
it um help bring OCA and the department
 
00:41:44.510 --> 00:41:44.520 align:start position:0%
together if we inserted a new sentence
 
00:41:46.470 --> 00:41:46.480 align:start position:0%
that said something about the department
 
00:41:49.030 --> 00:41:49.040 align:start position:0%
making good faith efforts to do as many
 
00:41:53.270 --> 00:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
as four a year so that we we so that we
 
00:41:55.790 --> 00:41:55.800 align:start position:0%
remove the distinction between what
 
00:41:57.910 --> 00:41:57.920 align:start position:0%
we're legally obligated to do and what
 
00:42:00.510 --> 00:42:00.520 align:start position:0%
we want to do aspirationally could we
 
00:42:03.950 --> 00:42:03.960 align:start position:0%
could we add a sentence uh there about
 
00:42:05.910 --> 00:42:05.920 align:start position:0%
um the department making good faith
 
00:42:11.309 --> 00:42:11.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:13.870 --> 00:42:13.880 align:start position:0%
two currently they're you know required
 
00:42:15.670 --> 00:42:15.680 align:start position:0%
to do twice per year
 
00:42:18.589 --> 00:42:18.599 align:start position:0%
including and I think one unannounced is
 
00:42:20.349 --> 00:42:20.359 align:start position:0%
that a part of the
 
00:42:22.510 --> 00:42:22.520 align:start position:0%
two the new language that's what it
 
00:42:25.950 --> 00:42:25.960 align:start position:0%
would be it would be so just two okay
 
00:42:29.069 --> 00:42:29.079 align:start position:0%
great but at a minimum
 
00:42:30.910 --> 00:42:30.920 align:start position:0%
we would endorse more than
 
00:42:34.630 --> 00:42:34.640 align:start position:0%
two we we requested corly I I think just
 
00:42:36.309 --> 00:42:36.319 align:start position:0%
to bring to the Forefront and and we
 
00:42:38.870 --> 00:42:38.880 align:start position:0%
didn't get to give sort of the context
 
00:42:40.510 --> 00:42:40.520 align:start position:0%
and background to this bill to begin
 
00:42:43.150 --> 00:42:43.160 align:start position:0%
with a discovery that was made after the
 
00:42:45.510 --> 00:42:45.520 align:start position:0%
bledo incident was that in fact the
 
00:42:48.950 --> 00:42:48.960 align:start position:0%
required annual visits were
 
00:42:51.349 --> 00:42:51.359 align:start position:0%
often I'm going to take back often we
 
00:42:53.190 --> 00:42:53.200 align:start position:0%
don't know but we know they weren't
 
00:42:55.910 --> 00:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
always being done at all so potentially
 
00:42:58.470 --> 00:42:58.480 align:start position:0%
we're going from zero V which is
 
00:43:01.150 --> 00:43:01.160 align:start position:0%
dangerous to but we we're trying to get
 
00:43:03.150 --> 00:43:03.160 align:start position:0%
data on that we've requested data on
 
00:43:04.589 --> 00:43:04.599 align:start position:0%
exactly what was happening to try and
 
00:43:06.030 --> 00:43:06.040 align:start position:0%
get a
 
00:43:08.910 --> 00:43:08.920 align:start position:0%
baseline the other issue I think and and
 
00:43:10.589 --> 00:43:10.599 align:start position:0%
going back to the building out of the
 
00:43:12.430 --> 00:43:12.440 align:start position:0%
certification team this is one of the
 
00:43:14.990 --> 00:43:15.000 align:start position:0%
places where the OCA really has an issue
 
00:43:18.109 --> 00:43:18.119 align:start position:0%
with the fiscal request of they
 
00:43:20.790 --> 00:43:20.800 align:start position:0%
requested eight new positions to build
 
00:43:22.109 --> 00:43:22.119 align:start position:0%
that certification team currently
 
00:43:23.549 --> 00:43:23.559 align:start position:0%
they're an agency of eight so they want
 
00:43:26.390 --> 00:43:26.400 align:start position:0%
to double the size of their agency to do
 
00:43:27.670 --> 00:43:27.680 align:start position:0%
visits that are actually already
 
00:43:30.150 --> 00:43:30.160 align:start position:0%
required because they weren't doing them
 
00:43:33.470 --> 00:43:33.480 align:start position:0%
always now we had discussed last fall
 
00:43:35.670 --> 00:43:35.680 align:start position:0%
that two to three more people would be
 
00:43:38.750 --> 00:43:38.760 align:start position:0%
appropriate in addition we have data on
 
00:43:40.950 --> 00:43:40.960 align:start position:0%
the number of children in placements and
 
00:43:43.430 --> 00:43:43.440 align:start position:0%
the number of certified placements what
 
00:43:46.190 --> 00:43:46.200 align:start position:0%
we don't have is the number of certified
 
00:43:47.750 --> 00:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
placements where there are currently
 
00:43:50.470 --> 00:43:50.480 align:start position:0%
children because this only requires them
 
00:43:52.150 --> 00:43:52.160 align:start position:0%
to do more than once a year visits to
 
00:43:54.549 --> 00:43:54.559 align:start position:0%
places where children physically are at
 
00:43:58.270 --> 00:43:58.280 align:start position:0%
that moment so again it seems to be an
 
00:44:01.190 --> 00:44:01.200 align:start position:0%
overblown number and we've been asking
 
00:44:03.990 --> 00:44:04.000 align:start position:0%
for the specific numbers of okay so we
 
00:44:07.990 --> 00:44:08.000 align:start position:0%
know there's 264 children placed under
 
00:44:10.950 --> 00:44:10.960 align:start position:0%
dcyf care in New Hampshire facilities DC
 
00:44:14.069 --> 00:44:14.079 align:start position:0%
was 228 228 sorry we know there are 32
 
00:44:15.710 --> 00:44:15.720 align:start position:0%
certified facilities in New Hampshire
 
00:44:17.430 --> 00:44:17.440 align:start position:0%
what we don't know is how many of those
 
00:44:20.270 --> 00:44:20.280 align:start position:0%
facilities have those 228 kits
 
00:44:22.790 --> 00:44:22.800 align:start position:0%
presumably in New Hampshire probably all
 
00:44:26.309 --> 00:44:26.319 align:start position:0%
32 in New England there's 28 certified
 
00:44:30.589 --> 00:44:30.599 align:start position:0%
facilities only 56
 
00:44:33.750 --> 00:44:33.760 align:start position:0%
kids 56 children placed by
 
00:44:36.630 --> 00:44:36.640 align:start position:0%
dcyf there's 28 certified facilities we
 
00:44:38.109 --> 00:44:38.119 align:start position:0%
do not believe there are children at all
 
00:44:39.750 --> 00:44:39.760 align:start position:0%
28 which means you're not visiting all
 
00:44:42.430 --> 00:44:42.440 align:start position:0%
28 under this either version whether
 
00:44:44.349 --> 00:44:44.359 align:start position:0%
it's four times a year or twice a year
 
00:44:46.109 --> 00:44:46.119 align:start position:0%
and then outside of New England so this
 
00:44:48.510 --> 00:44:48.520 align:start position:0%
is the big one when you start looking at
 
00:44:50.270 --> 00:44:50.280 align:start position:0%
section eight the appropriation for
 
00:44:53.549 --> 00:44:53.559 align:start position:0%
travel there's actually only three dcyf
 
00:44:57.109 --> 00:44:57.119 align:start position:0%
youth placed outside of New England we
 
00:45:00.230 --> 00:45:00.240 align:start position:0%
knew um two ones in Arkansas ones in
 
00:45:02.950 --> 00:45:02.960 align:start position:0%
Florida there are also some voluntarily
 
00:45:05.030 --> 00:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
placed youth so bcbh would be visiting
 
00:45:07.309 --> 00:45:07.319 align:start position:0%
those facilities but there's 24
 
00:45:09.390 --> 00:45:09.400 align:start position:0%
certified facilities outside New England
 
00:45:11.309 --> 00:45:11.319 align:start position:0%
certainly five children are not at 24
 
00:45:14.270 --> 00:45:14.280 align:start position:0%
facilities so again we're struggling to
 
00:45:17.870 --> 00:45:17.880 align:start position:0%
get accurate data of where exactly
 
00:45:19.069 --> 00:45:19.079 align:start position:0%
people are going to have to go you're
 
00:45:21.510 --> 00:45:21.520 align:start position:0%
telling us you need eight more people
 
00:45:24.710 --> 00:45:24.720 align:start position:0%
and almost a million dollars to go visit
 
00:45:27.710 --> 00:45:27.720 align:start position:0%
when we know that it's a much smaller
 
00:45:29.990 --> 00:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
universe so that's where we're
 
00:45:32.870 --> 00:45:32.880 align:start position:0%
struggling with the appropriation piece
 
00:45:34.430 --> 00:45:34.440 align:start position:0%
because we just think it does not line
 
00:45:36.670 --> 00:45:36.680 align:start position:0%
up with what this bill actually requires
 
00:45:38.270 --> 00:45:38.280 align:start position:0%
we would love there to be quarterly
 
00:45:40.829 --> 00:45:40.839 align:start position:0%
visits two a year is better than zero a
 
00:45:42.510 --> 00:45:42.520 align:start position:0%
year they should have already budgeted
 
00:45:45.309 --> 00:45:45.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:48.510 --> 00:45:48.520 align:start position:0%
year yes yes would it be appropriate
 
00:45:53.510 --> 00:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
then just to online 32 and 33 put at
 
00:45:56.349 --> 00:45:56.359 align:start position:0%
least two twice a year and one
 
00:45:58.069 --> 00:45:58.079 align:start position:0%
unannounced if
 
00:46:00.510 --> 00:46:00.520 align:start position:0%
needed we would say the unannounced is
 
00:46:03.470 --> 00:46:03.480 align:start position:0%
always needed okay but we'd love that
 
00:46:06.990 --> 00:46:07.000 align:start position:0%
three would be great better than two
 
00:46:09.750 --> 00:46:09.760 align:start position:0%
yeah so I I would be so I would not
 
00:46:12.069 --> 00:46:12.079 align:start position:0%
support that though I I I would rather
 
00:46:16.069 --> 00:46:16.079 align:start position:0%
have the minimum language as the shall
 
00:46:18.190 --> 00:46:18.200 align:start position:0%
and and I asked a question earlier that
 
00:46:19.870 --> 00:46:19.880 align:start position:0%
I don't think has been addressed would
 
00:46:22.829 --> 00:46:22.839 align:start position:0%
it plate the department if we inserted
 
00:46:25.630 --> 00:46:25.640 align:start position:0%
some good faith language to say that
 
00:46:27.829 --> 00:46:27.839 align:start position:0%
that the number of inspect inpections
 
00:46:29.950 --> 00:46:29.960 align:start position:0%
the department shall make best efforts
 
00:46:32.829 --> 00:46:32.839 align:start position:0%
or good faith efforts to do uh three or
 
00:46:35.710 --> 00:46:35.720 align:start position:0%
four a year so so I'm trying to make a
 
00:46:38.190 --> 00:46:38.200 align:start position:0%
distinction between what we can be sued
 
00:46:40.670 --> 00:46:40.680 align:start position:0%
over and what we can build policy and
 
00:46:40.680 --> 00:46:43.150 align:start position:0%
over and what we can build policy and
budgets

00:46:43.150 --> 00:46:43.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:45.950 --> 00:46:45.960 align:start position:0%
around that I'm I'm I'm trying to help
 
00:46:49.549 --> 00:46:49.559 align:start position:0%
the department and the OCA by finding a
 
00:46:52.829 --> 00:46:52.839 align:start position:0%
middle ground approach here could I
 
00:46:54.309 --> 00:46:54.319 align:start position:0%
could I just ask the department a
 
00:46:57.589 --> 00:46:57.599 align:start position:0%
question so if you go out and make um
 
00:47:00.470 --> 00:47:00.480 align:start position:0%
your the one visit a year and during
 
00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:01.510 align:start position:0%
your the one visit a year and during
that

00:47:01.510 --> 00:47:01.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:47:01.520 --> 00:47:03.230 align:start position:0%
that
visit

00:47:03.230 --> 00:47:03.240 align:start position:0%
visit
 
00:47:05.549 --> 00:47:05.559 align:start position:0%
um the person doing the visiting from
 
00:47:07.870 --> 00:47:07.880 align:start position:0%
the department has some concerns but
 
00:47:10.470 --> 00:47:10.480 align:start position:0%
they don't really rise to the level of
 
00:47:13.950 --> 00:47:13.960 align:start position:0%
that um the child advocate found in the
 
00:47:17.589 --> 00:47:17.599 align:start position:0%
Tennessee facility but they now can go
 
00:47:20.589 --> 00:47:20.599 align:start position:0%
back to that facility and do as many
 
00:47:25.349 --> 00:47:25.359 align:start position:0%
visits as they deem or they need to do I
 
00:47:29.589 --> 00:47:29.599 align:start position:0%
believe so y yeah I um but I mean we
 
00:47:31.910 --> 00:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
also have written in here a corrective
 
00:47:35.630 --> 00:47:35.640 align:start position:0%
action plan as well for the facility to
 
00:47:38.150 --> 00:47:38.160 align:start position:0%
come up to speed okay okay and then do
 
00:47:40.109 --> 00:47:40.119 align:start position:0%
you go back and follow up with that
 
00:47:42.349 --> 00:47:42.359 align:start position:0%
corrective action plan to be sure they
 
00:47:45.630 --> 00:47:45.640 align:start position:0%
actually did it do you want to grab a
 
00:47:47.950 --> 00:47:47.960 align:start position:0%
mic pull up a
 
00:47:50.230 --> 00:47:50.240 align:start position:0%
mic oh please don't knock why isn't
 
00:47:51.710 --> 00:47:51.720 align:start position:0%
everybody just bring their chair up I
 
00:47:55.829 --> 00:47:55.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:55.839 --> 00:48:05.349 align:start position:0%
 
upstairs

00:48:05.349 --> 00:48:05.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:07.309 --> 00:48:07.319 align:start position:0%
um good morning Rebecca Ross from Thea
 
00:48:08.630 --> 00:48:08.640 align:start position:0%
uh Bureau for children's Behavioral
 
00:48:10.670 --> 00:48:10.680 align:start position:0%
Health currently what happens is we go
 
00:48:13.670 --> 00:48:13.680 align:start position:0%
out um once a year the certification
 
00:48:16.230 --> 00:48:16.240 align:start position:0%
runs for two years one year is the
 
00:48:18.349 --> 00:48:18.359 align:start position:0%
certification visit the following year
 
00:48:19.990 --> 00:48:20.000 align:start position:0%
is the technical assistance quality
 
00:48:23.990 --> 00:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
assurance visit um the the function of
 
00:48:25.870 --> 00:48:25.880 align:start position:0%
the visit is always the same to look at
 
00:48:27.670 --> 00:48:27.680 align:start position:0%
the facility to interview youth to
 
00:48:30.349 --> 00:48:30.359 align:start position:0%
interview staff to check records and go
 
00:48:31.950 --> 00:48:31.960 align:start position:0%
through things it is more comprehensive
 
00:48:34.510 --> 00:48:34.520 align:start position:0%
on the 2-year certification if there's
 
00:48:36.910 --> 00:48:36.920 align:start position:0%
something identified on either one there
 
00:48:40.230 --> 00:48:40.240 align:start position:0%
is um the certification or the visit
 
00:48:43.589 --> 00:48:43.599 align:start position:0%
report a corrective action plan and then
 
00:48:45.270 --> 00:48:45.280 align:start position:0%
a back and forth with the facility to
 
00:48:47.549 --> 00:48:47.559 align:start position:0%
ensure that they are following up and
 
00:48:48.829 --> 00:48:48.839 align:start position:0%
then the next time they are on site
 
00:48:50.430 --> 00:48:50.440 align:start position:0%
they're also checking in on that it
 
00:48:52.430 --> 00:48:52.440 align:start position:0%
really depends on what it is if it's
 
00:48:54.510 --> 00:48:54.520 align:start position:0%
something with the facility and we need
 
00:48:56.789 --> 00:48:56.799 align:start position:0%
eyes on to see it or it's update this
 
00:48:58.789 --> 00:48:58.799 align:start position:0%
document or update this policy some of
 
00:49:00.309 --> 00:49:00.319 align:start position:0%
the corrective action items are very
 
00:49:02.829 --> 00:49:02.839 align:start position:0%
easily done from the office and we're
 
00:49:04.589 --> 00:49:04.599 align:start position:0%
not on sign other things we would need
 
00:49:05.950 --> 00:49:05.960 align:start position:0%
to be on site we certainly have the
 
00:49:08.710 --> 00:49:08.720 align:start position:0%
ability to go onsite at any time we do
 
00:49:11.150 --> 00:49:11.160 align:start position:0%
not have the resources currently we have
 
00:49:12.549 --> 00:49:12.559 align:start position:0%
three people that do all of the
 
00:49:15.789 --> 00:49:15.799 align:start position:0%
residential Contracting visits technical
 
00:49:18.630 --> 00:49:18.640 align:start position:0%
assistance collaboration management of
 
00:49:20.870 --> 00:49:20.880 align:start position:0%
individual kids eligibility for
 
00:49:23.589 --> 00:49:23.599 align:start position:0%
voluntary cases and a number of other
 
00:49:25.190 --> 00:49:25.200 align:start position:0%
responsibilities so they are on the
 
00:49:26.270 --> 00:49:26.280 align:start position:0%
certification team but they are
 
00:49:29.069 --> 00:49:29.079 align:start position:0%
certainly not exclusive to that um
 
00:49:30.710 --> 00:49:30.720 align:start position:0%
they've made three out of state visits
 
00:49:33.190 --> 00:49:33.200 align:start position:0%
in the last 3 to four weeks one
 
00:49:35.630 --> 00:49:35.640 align:start position:0%
individual is in Atlanta today there are
 
00:49:37.190 --> 00:49:37.200 align:start position:0%
times that we are going to a place to
 
00:49:39.109 --> 00:49:39.119 align:start position:0%
certify it and then the placement falls
 
00:49:40.789 --> 00:49:40.799 align:start position:0%
through so even though there are only
 
00:49:43.150 --> 00:49:43.160 align:start position:0%
five kids we are still working with 10
 
00:49:45.349 --> 00:49:45.359 align:start position:0%
to 15 facilities at any time to either
 
00:49:47.670 --> 00:49:47.680 align:start position:0%
bring them on board or do a visit to see
 
00:49:49.990 --> 00:49:50.000 align:start position:0%
if a youth can go so there's a lot of
 
00:49:51.950 --> 00:49:51.960 align:start position:0%
back and forth and a lot of uncertainty
 
00:49:55.430 --> 00:49:55.440 align:start position:0%
on the visits that need to be done thank
 
00:49:57.309 --> 00:49:57.319 align:start position:0%
you question
 
00:50:01.710 --> 00:50:01.720 align:start position:0%
um so again my understanding you have
 
00:50:03.990 --> 00:50:04.000 align:start position:0%
currently you have 21
 
00:50:08.190 --> 00:50:08.200 align:start position:0%
28 in the New England area 24 outside
 
00:50:10.950 --> 00:50:10.960 align:start position:0%
the New England area are you doing
 
00:50:18.990 --> 00:50:19.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:23.150 --> 00:50:23.160 align:start position:0%
year we are not doing the on-site visit
 
00:50:24.950 --> 00:50:24.960 align:start position:0%
but we are doing the certification
 
00:50:26.829 --> 00:50:26.839 align:start position:0%
process to keep them on the roles if
 
00:50:29.950 --> 00:50:29.960 align:start position:0%
they want to continue to be a certified
 
00:50:32.030 --> 00:50:32.040 align:start position:0%
provider some are very unique specific
 
00:50:33.630 --> 00:50:33.640 align:start position:0%
providers that we may not never have a
 
00:50:35.910 --> 00:50:35.920 align:start position:0%
youth in the next couple years but then
 
00:50:37.470 --> 00:50:37.480 align:start position:0%
three years from now we do so the
 
00:50:40.309 --> 00:50:40.319 align:start position:0%
question is yes okay thank you if I
 
00:50:42.270 --> 00:50:42.280 align:start position:0%
could just add that I appreciate your
 
00:50:45.309 --> 00:50:45.319 align:start position:0%
question representative priest um just a
 
00:50:48.309 --> 00:50:48.319 align:start position:0%
couple things so if you look at the next
 
00:50:51.870 --> 00:50:51.880 align:start position:0%
page line six of Page Three and this
 
00:50:53.750 --> 00:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
this has essentially been in here the
 
00:50:55.630 --> 00:50:55.640 align:start position:0%
entire time through all the
 
00:50:58.470 --> 00:50:58.480 align:start position:0%
iterations as of the adoption of this
 
00:51:00.670 --> 00:51:00.680 align:start position:0%
bill there will not be placements
 
00:51:03.270 --> 00:51:03.280 align:start position:0%
outside of New England without specific
 
00:51:06.349 --> 00:51:06.359 align:start position:0%
director approval one of the main
 
00:51:08.910 --> 00:51:08.920 align:start position:0%
reasons for this bill is we need to keep
 
00:51:10.589 --> 00:51:10.599 align:start position:0%
children closer to their homes and their
 
00:51:13.670 --> 00:51:13.680 align:start position:0%
families so the 24 outside of New
 
00:51:16.910 --> 00:51:16.920 align:start position:0%
England hopefully won't be used at all
 
00:51:19.950 --> 00:51:19.960 align:start position:0%
anymore um I would also point out that
 
00:51:22.069 --> 00:51:22.079 align:start position:0%
the certification process currently on
 
00:51:24.069 --> 00:51:24.079 align:start position:0%
the books in administrative rule does
 
00:51:27.309 --> 00:51:27.319 align:start position:0%
require the certification to be in
 
00:51:29.670 --> 00:51:29.680 align:start position:0%
person but sounds like that is not
 
00:51:32.589 --> 00:51:32.599 align:start position:0%
currently happening um we had proposed
 
00:51:36.510 --> 00:51:36.520 align:start position:0%
language in this new section uh Roman
 
00:51:39.349 --> 00:51:39.359 align:start position:0%
five because they're only visiting
 
00:51:42.430 --> 00:51:42.440 align:start position:0%
places where New Hampshire children are
 
00:51:45.230 --> 00:51:45.240 align:start position:0%
um we had requested language be added
 
00:51:47.510 --> 00:51:47.520 align:start position:0%
that if they are proposing to place a
 
00:51:49.030 --> 00:51:49.040 align:start position:0%
child there even if it's already
 
00:51:50.910 --> 00:51:50.920 align:start position:0%
certified there needs to be an imperson
 
00:51:52.950 --> 00:51:52.960 align:start position:0%
visit if nothing if there hasn't been an
 
00:51:54.870 --> 00:51:54.880 align:start position:0%
inperson visit within 90 days because
 
00:51:57.390 --> 00:51:57.400 align:start position:0%
now you're saying if was certified
 
00:51:59.230 --> 00:51:59.240 align:start position:0%
January 1st of
 
00:52:02.990 --> 00:52:03.000 align:start position:0%
2023 and it's now December 15th 2023
 
00:52:04.549 --> 00:52:04.559 align:start position:0%
you're potentially going to send a kid
 
00:52:06.710 --> 00:52:06.720 align:start position:0%
there having not and now I'm hearing
 
00:52:08.030 --> 00:52:08.040 align:start position:0%
that if there wasn't a kid there and
 
00:52:09.630 --> 00:52:09.640 align:start position:0%
they recertified they didn't visit at
 
00:52:11.309 --> 00:52:11.319 align:start position:0%
all so now when was the last time
 
00:52:12.950 --> 00:52:12.960 align:start position:0%
someone's eyes was on this facility
 
00:52:14.309 --> 00:52:14.319 align:start position:0%
because who knows what's going on there
 
00:52:17.789 --> 00:52:17.799 align:start position:0%
so again and the oca's job is to protect
 
00:52:20.069 --> 00:52:20.079 align:start position:0%
children obviously we are always
 
00:52:22.390 --> 00:52:22.400 align:start position:0%
thinking about best interest the trauma
 
00:52:24.390 --> 00:52:24.400 align:start position:0%
the harm what potentially could be
 
00:52:26.230 --> 00:52:26.240 align:start position:0%
happening because while we caught what
 
00:52:27.390 --> 00:52:27.400 align:start position:0%
was Happ happening at
 
00:52:29.510 --> 00:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
bledo there's a lot of information out
 
00:52:31.789 --> 00:52:31.799 align:start position:0%
there that it's not just bledo that that
 
00:52:33.589 --> 00:52:33.599 align:start position:0%
bad things are happening maybe not to
 
00:52:35.390 --> 00:52:35.400 align:start position:0%
that degree hopefully but but some
 
00:52:39.390 --> 00:52:39.400 align:start position:0%
places yes so having eyes on
 
00:52:41.910 --> 00:52:41.920 align:start position:0%
facilities frequently and certainly
 
00:52:43.670 --> 00:52:43.680 align:start position:0%
before you put a kid there is important
 
00:52:46.390 --> 00:52:46.400 align:start position:0%
but we have seen the bureau go out and
 
00:52:48.510 --> 00:52:48.520 align:start position:0%
emergency certify a placement they
 
00:52:49.910 --> 00:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
actually just did it in Virginia this
 
00:52:52.430 --> 00:52:52.440 align:start position:0%
past month um so they do have that
 
00:52:54.230 --> 00:52:54.240 align:start position:0%
capacity we're hearing that there's two
 
00:52:55.670 --> 00:52:55.680 align:start position:0%
or three people that do it now that's
 
00:52:58.230 --> 00:52:58.240 align:start position:0%
why we're proposing this new team be two
 
00:53:00.230 --> 00:53:00.240 align:start position:0%
to three dedicated people that that is
 
00:53:01.630 --> 00:53:01.640 align:start position:0%
all they're doing because it is a it is
 
00:53:04.270 --> 00:53:04.280 align:start position:0%
a lift well and if I may add in this we
 
00:53:06.910 --> 00:53:06.920 align:start position:0%
too are thinking about the potential for
 
00:53:08.910 --> 00:53:08.920 align:start position:0%
lawsuits and are thinking that these are
 
00:53:10.510 --> 00:53:10.520 align:start position:0%
actually a protection against that
 
00:53:12.030 --> 00:53:12.040 align:start position:0%
because if you're there you're seeing
 
00:53:13.190 --> 00:53:13.200 align:start position:0%
what's happening you've gathered the
 
00:53:15.309 --> 00:53:15.319 align:start position:0%
information and know what's going on
 
00:53:17.670 --> 00:53:17.680 align:start position:0%
hopefully and and more frequently that
 
00:53:19.349 --> 00:53:19.359 align:start position:0%
would be caught before a child is
 
00:53:21.230 --> 00:53:21.240 align:start position:0%
further traumatized which would lead to
 
00:53:23.069 --> 00:53:23.079 align:start position:0%
somebody taking out a lawsuit next state
 
00:53:25.109 --> 00:53:25.119 align:start position:0%
so that is an attention in there is a
 
00:53:27.630 --> 00:53:27.640 align:start position:0%
lawsuit do diligence was done a
 
00:53:29.109 --> 00:53:29.119 align:start position:0%
reasonable person
 
00:53:31.549 --> 00:53:31.559 align:start position:0%
standard was
 
00:53:34.910 --> 00:53:34.920 align:start position:0%
met question again um are you in
 
00:53:37.510 --> 00:53:37.520 align:start position:0%
constant contact with the other states
 
00:53:40.430 --> 00:53:40.440 align:start position:0%
and their certification problems so if a
 
00:53:43.390 --> 00:53:43.400 align:start position:0%
facility like in Virginia suddenly
 
00:53:46.910 --> 00:53:46.920 align:start position:0%
becomes desertified for whatever reason
 
00:53:48.990 --> 00:53:49.000 align:start position:0%
do they communicate that to you so
 
00:53:52.589 --> 00:53:52.599 align:start position:0%
you're on top of it and you don't put a
 
00:53:55.349 --> 00:53:55.359 align:start position:0%
child there if it's not certified by
 
00:53:59.630 --> 00:53:59.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:02.309 --> 00:54:02.319 align:start position:0%
you yes we absolutely do when we're
 
00:54:03.829 --> 00:54:03.839 align:start position:0%
doing the recertification process we're
 
00:54:05.150 --> 00:54:05.160 align:start position:0%
reaching out to the other states the
 
00:54:06.750 --> 00:54:06.760 align:start position:0%
providers have an obligation to let us
 
00:54:08.349 --> 00:54:08.359 align:start position:0%
know and we certainly have a
 
00:54:09.829 --> 00:54:09.839 align:start position:0%
relationship with the home state of
 
00:54:11.349 --> 00:54:11.359 align:start position:0%
those providers as we're going through
 
00:54:13.829 --> 00:54:13.839 align:start position:0%
the process so is it possible that
 
00:54:15.910 --> 00:54:15.920 align:start position:0%
something could happen one day and we
 
00:54:19.309 --> 00:54:19.319 align:start position:0%
don't learn that exact day absolutely I
 
00:54:21.589 --> 00:54:21.599 align:start position:0%
think things can can always happen but
 
00:54:23.030 --> 00:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
yes that is certainly part of our
 
00:54:24.549 --> 00:54:24.559 align:start position:0%
process and part of their obligation to
 
00:54:26.069 --> 00:54:26.079 align:start position:0%
let us know if their licensing status
 
00:54:26.079 --> 00:54:27.910 align:start position:0%
let us know if their licensing status
changed

00:54:27.910 --> 00:54:27.920 align:start position:0%
changed
 
00:54:29.829 --> 00:54:29.839 align:start position:0%
and even from a child advocate point of
 
00:54:32.470 --> 00:54:32.480 align:start position:0%
view so when bledo occurred and we
 
00:54:34.270 --> 00:54:34.280 align:start position:0%
issued our report we we have a network
 
00:54:36.069 --> 00:54:36.079 align:start position:0%
of other child advocacy offices we
 
00:54:38.349 --> 00:54:38.359 align:start position:0%
certainly broadcast that across the
 
00:54:40.589 --> 00:54:40.599 align:start position:0%
country of this we just found this at
 
00:54:42.510 --> 00:54:42.520 align:start position:0%
this facility to put other child
 
00:54:45.470 --> 00:54:45.480 align:start position:0%
advocate offices on notice I know bcbh
 
00:54:47.510 --> 00:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
desertified bledo after a couple of
 
00:54:49.109 --> 00:54:49.119 align:start position:0%
months I don't know how that network
 
00:54:53.549 --> 00:54:53.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:55.990 --> 00:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
communication so thank you madam chair I
 
00:54:58.230 --> 00:54:58.240 align:start position:0%
I just have three points related to
 
00:55:00.030 --> 00:55:00.040 align:start position:0%
lines 32 through
 
00:55:04.190 --> 00:55:04.200 align:start position:0%
36 first uh o overall I I just want to
 
00:55:06.789 --> 00:55:06.799 align:start position:0%
say I think everyone in this room shares
 
00:55:09.910 --> 00:55:09.920 align:start position:0%
the uh desire to protect all of our
 
00:55:14.309 --> 00:55:14.319 align:start position:0%
children so it so OCA that's obviously
 
00:55:17.030 --> 00:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
your primary Charter but I don't want to
 
00:55:19.630 --> 00:55:19.640 align:start position:0%
leave it hanging in the air that the
 
00:55:22.150 --> 00:55:22.160 align:start position:0%
rest of us don't care as much as you do
 
00:55:25.109 --> 00:55:25.119 align:start position:0%
about kids okay so so I I want to get
 
00:55:29.029 --> 00:55:29.039 align:start position:0%
that out there um um uh and what you
 
00:55:32.589 --> 00:55:32.599 align:start position:0%
were saying about going and visiting
 
00:55:35.270 --> 00:55:35.280 align:start position:0%
like I'll call it a stale certification
 
00:55:39.430 --> 00:55:39.440 align:start position:0%
whatever we Define as stale you know uh
 
00:55:41.390 --> 00:55:41.400 align:start position:0%
going and double-checking it before we
 
00:55:43.430 --> 00:55:43.440 align:start position:0%
place a kid there to make sure that we
 
00:55:45.789 --> 00:55:45.799 align:start position:0%
know what the current situation is if
 
00:55:47.870 --> 00:55:47.880 align:start position:0%
that's new language in here I'm I'm I'm
 
00:55:50.510 --> 00:55:50.520 align:start position:0%
personally okay with that and then for
 
00:55:52.309 --> 00:55:52.319 align:start position:0%
the third time I want to ask the
 
00:55:54.789 --> 00:55:54.799 align:start position:0%
question and try to get an answer on the
 
00:55:59.430 --> 00:55:59.440 align:start position:0%
third time miss Morris I'll ask you
 
00:56:03.029 --> 00:56:03.039 align:start position:0%
specifically uh would it be helpful if
 
00:56:06.430 --> 00:56:06.440 align:start position:0%
we kept the language in 32 and 33 of at
 
00:56:09.150 --> 00:56:09.160 align:start position:0%
least twice per year one of which is an
 
00:56:12.870 --> 00:56:12.880 align:start position:0%
unannounced visit and added a sentence
 
00:56:16.390 --> 00:56:16.400 align:start position:0%
to talk about an aspirational goal or a
 
00:56:20.029 --> 00:56:20.039 align:start position:0%
good faith effort to do more than that
 
00:56:22.470 --> 00:56:22.480 align:start position:0%
would that would would that would that
 
00:56:24.910 --> 00:56:24.920 align:start position:0%
be beneficial to the policy and
 
00:56:27.230 --> 00:56:27.240 align:start position:0%
budgeting process
 
00:56:28.910 --> 00:56:28.920 align:start position:0%
I think it really depends on what you
 
00:56:31.710 --> 00:56:31.720 align:start position:0%
want as a result of that visit it is if
 
00:56:33.950 --> 00:56:33.960 align:start position:0%
it's merely it's the same thing as every
 
00:56:36.190 --> 00:56:36.200 align:start position:0%
other visit that's my objective is it
 
00:56:38.670 --> 00:56:38.680 align:start position:0%
would be the same as every other visit
 
00:56:41.589 --> 00:56:41.599 align:start position:0%
but instead of being required in law we
 
00:56:43.549 --> 00:56:43.559 align:start position:0%
would be doing it because we think it's
 
00:56:46.549 --> 00:56:46.559 align:start position:0%
good policy as opposed to good law and I
 
00:56:48.670 --> 00:56:48.680 align:start position:0%
see a distinction between what we put in
 
00:56:50.829 --> 00:56:50.839 align:start position:0%
law and what we try to do with our
 
00:56:53.750 --> 00:56:53.760 align:start position:0%
Department's uh work effort so so I
 
00:56:56.230 --> 00:56:56.240 align:start position:0%
think from our perspective a unannounced
 
00:56:57.990 --> 00:56:58.000 align:start position:0%
announced visit is going to be very
 
00:57:00.349 --> 00:57:00.359 align:start position:0%
different and provide very different
 
00:57:02.470 --> 00:57:02.480 align:start position:0%
results than an announced visit because
 
00:57:04.510 --> 00:57:04.520 align:start position:0%
there is a lot of scheduling in advance
 
00:57:07.510 --> 00:57:07.520 align:start position:0%
work to pulling files and scheduling
 
00:57:09.150 --> 00:57:09.160 align:start position:0%
with staff and making sure the right
 
00:57:10.750 --> 00:57:10.760 align:start position:0%
people are on site and available
 
00:57:13.029 --> 00:57:13.039 align:start position:0%
including Youth and sending out surveys
 
00:57:15.029 --> 00:57:15.039 align:start position:0%
to parents and families and other staff
 
00:57:17.710 --> 00:57:17.720 align:start position:0%
in advance to prep for that visit so
 
00:57:20.309 --> 00:57:20.319 align:start position:0%
when we're doing our announced visit
 
00:57:21.870 --> 00:57:21.880 align:start position:0%
there's a ton of prep work if we're
 
00:57:23.910 --> 00:57:23.920 align:start position:0%
doing an unannounced visit we may not
 
00:57:25.309 --> 00:57:25.319 align:start position:0%
see any New Hampshire youth that could
 
00:57:28.589 --> 00:57:28.599 align:start position:0%
be on a field trip day um we will really
 
00:57:31.230 --> 00:57:31.240 align:start position:0%
only be able to walk in talk to whoever
 
00:57:32.990 --> 00:57:33.000 align:start position:0%
may be available and have time for us
 
00:57:35.430 --> 00:57:35.440 align:start position:0%
and see the facility and not get those
 
00:57:38.910 --> 00:57:38.920 align:start position:0%
same outcomes so if we only want one of
 
00:57:41.390 --> 00:57:41.400 align:start position:0%
the structured visits per year and the
 
00:57:42.950 --> 00:57:42.960 align:start position:0%
other one to be un announc that language
 
00:57:45.549 --> 00:57:45.559 align:start position:0%
would be fine if we want two visits per
 
00:57:47.309 --> 00:57:47.319 align:start position:0%
year that are structured and have that
 
00:57:49.470 --> 00:57:49.480 align:start position:0%
same kind of report out then we would
 
00:57:53.430 --> 00:57:53.440 align:start position:0%
need a third unscheduled visit okay so
 
00:57:55.470 --> 00:57:55.480 align:start position:0%
I'm going to take that as a yes to my
 
00:57:58.910 --> 00:57:58.920 align:start position:0%
question yes adding a sentence dealing
 
00:58:01.630 --> 00:58:01.640 align:start position:0%
with good faith efforts to do more than
 
00:58:04.549 --> 00:58:04.559 align:start position:0%
the minimum required would be helpful
 
00:58:06.470 --> 00:58:06.480 align:start position:0%
what you just went into is a tremendous
 
00:58:09.270 --> 00:58:09.280 align:start position:0%
amount of detail about the nature of
 
00:58:11.470 --> 00:58:11.480 align:start position:0%
those additional good faith visits and
 
00:58:14.029 --> 00:58:14.039 align:start position:0%
that's fine figure that out but I'm just
 
00:58:17.589 --> 00:58:17.599 align:start position:0%
trying to make sure that the OCA
 
00:58:20.950 --> 00:58:20.960 align:start position:0%
realizes we're we're hearing them that
 
00:58:24.150 --> 00:58:24.160 align:start position:0%
more is more better but I don't want to
 
00:58:26.109 --> 00:58:26.119 align:start position:0%
obligate the state to something that we
 
00:58:28.430 --> 00:58:28.440 align:start position:0%
we may not be able to achieve in in in
 
00:58:30.950 --> 00:58:30.960 align:start position:0%
two 3 four years for now this is going
 
00:58:32.630 --> 00:58:32.640 align:start position:0%
to be the Hot Topic and we're going to
 
00:58:34.430 --> 00:58:34.440 align:start position:0%
get on this and we're going to fix it
 
00:58:36.390 --> 00:58:36.400 align:start position:0%
but the legislator in three or four
 
00:58:38.230 --> 00:58:38.240 align:start position:0%
terms they're going to have different
 
00:58:40.910 --> 00:58:40.920 align:start position:0%
priorities different issues and I I want
 
00:58:44.829 --> 00:58:44.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:48.150 --> 00:58:48.160 align:start position:0%
breathe um in response to that um I was
 
00:58:50.069 --> 00:58:50.079 align:start position:0%
wondering if represented the
 
00:58:54.190 --> 00:58:54.200 align:start position:0%
representative uh would agree to uh on
 
00:58:56.630 --> 00:58:56.640 align:start position:0%
line 32
 
00:59:01.510 --> 00:59:01.520 align:start position:0%
to um keep the wording at least twice
 
00:59:06.230 --> 00:59:06.240 align:start position:0%
per year and one unannounced visit so
 
00:59:10.029 --> 00:59:10.039 align:start position:0%
there' be three total at least three I
 
00:59:12.150 --> 00:59:12.160 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm not interested in doing that
 
00:59:14.710 --> 00:59:14.720 align:start position:0%
from a mandatory going from two to three
 
00:59:17.470 --> 00:59:17.480 align:start position:0%
that's 50% more visits I just assume
 
00:59:19.789 --> 00:59:19.799 align:start position:0%
right now we're having zero I so we're
 
00:59:21.750 --> 00:59:21.760 align:start position:0%
doing better already right because we're
 
00:59:25.870 --> 00:59:25.880 align:start position:0%
already at two right so so I I I would
 
00:59:27.549 --> 00:59:27.559 align:start position:0%
like like to keep and maybe I'm not
 
00:59:29.029 --> 00:59:29.039 align:start position:0%
making myself clear because of the
 
00:59:31.230 --> 00:59:31.240 align:start position:0%
litigation risk I'd rather keep Our
 
00:59:34.230 --> 00:59:34.240 align:start position:0%
obligation under the law
 
00:59:37.789 --> 00:59:37.799 align:start position:0%
limited and I'm totally okay with them
 
00:59:40.990 --> 00:59:41.000 align:start position:0%
doing more than what we legally obligate
 
00:59:42.990 --> 00:59:43.000 align:start position:0%
with this sentence that I keep talking
 
00:59:44.990 --> 00:59:45.000 align:start position:0%
about a a good faith the department
 
00:59:48.510 --> 00:59:48.520 align:start position:0%
shall make good faith so so so
 
00:59:50.789 --> 00:59:50.799 align:start position:0%
representative priest I I I hear you and
 
00:59:52.990 --> 00:59:53.000 align:start position:0%
I think the way to get there is by
 
00:59:56.950 --> 00:59:56.960 align:start position:0%
adding a good faith sentence yeah again
 
01:00:01.309 --> 01:00:01.319 align:start position:0%
my concern is with that in good faith is
 
01:00:04.589 --> 01:00:04.599 align:start position:0%
hard to budget for that so if a case
 
01:00:07.870 --> 01:00:07.880 align:start position:0%
comes up and they have to come out more
 
01:00:10.910 --> 01:00:10.920 align:start position:0%
than an additional one maybe twice visit
 
01:00:13.349 --> 01:00:13.359 align:start position:0%
because they see problems in it then
 
01:00:15.150 --> 01:00:15.160 align:start position:0%
it's hard they'll be over their budget
 
01:00:18.390 --> 01:00:18.400 align:start position:0%
so so so on the budgeting I I've I've
 
01:00:21.029 --> 01:00:21.039 align:start position:0%
sat through two budgets on
 
01:00:24.870 --> 01:00:24.880 align:start position:0%
DHHS and I I I don't think that it's
 
01:00:26.510 --> 01:00:26.520 align:start position:0%
particularly difficult for the
 
01:00:28.510 --> 01:00:28.520 align:start position:0%
Department to come up with what they
 
01:00:30.670 --> 01:00:30.680 align:start position:0%
think their good faith effort would be
 
01:00:33.470 --> 01:00:33.480 align:start position:0%
and then be subjected to division 3
 
01:00:36.230 --> 01:00:36.240 align:start position:0%
questioning you know what what's what
 
01:00:38.109 --> 01:00:38.119 align:start position:0%
what's really required here versus what
 
01:00:40.789 --> 01:00:40.799 align:start position:0%
you're trying to do and then that allows
 
01:00:44.069 --> 01:00:44.079 align:start position:0%
the division three people of the future
 
01:00:47.710 --> 01:00:47.720 align:start position:0%
to um allocate resources that are
 
01:00:52.109 --> 01:00:52.119 align:start position:0%
available for allocation I so so I get
 
01:00:53.910 --> 01:00:53.920 align:start position:0%
your point about budgeting but having
 
01:00:56.670 --> 01:00:56.680 align:start position:0%
done two of them and and represented
 
01:01:00.870 --> 01:01:00.880 align:start position:0%
Wallner has done a million of them uh I
 
01:01:03.589 --> 01:01:03.599 align:start position:0%
not a million I I I I don't think that
 
01:01:06.270 --> 01:01:06.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:08.430 --> 01:01:08.440 align:start position:0%
roadblock and if I could just point
 
01:01:10.109 --> 01:01:10.119 align:start position:0%
something out that I think helps support
 
01:01:13.549 --> 01:01:13.559 align:start position:0%
your point representative Edwards
 
01:01:16.270 --> 01:01:16.280 align:start position:0%
always and I did not mean to imply other
 
01:01:17.349 --> 01:01:17.359 align:start position:0%
people here don't want to protect
 
01:01:18.870 --> 01:01:18.880 align:start position:0%
children we're lucky that that's our
 
01:01:21.670 --> 01:01:21.680 align:start position:0%
sole Focus we don't have to talk about
 
01:01:26.029 --> 01:01:26.039 align:start position:0%
all the other stuff um so in line 36 I I
 
01:01:29.109 --> 01:01:29.119 align:start position:0%
will note that an additional protection
 
01:01:32.069 --> 01:01:32.079 align:start position:0%
here is that previously the records uh
 
01:01:33.990 --> 01:01:34.000 align:start position:0%
resulting from those visits by the BCB
 
01:01:35.470 --> 01:01:35.480 align:start position:0%
certification team only went to the
 
01:01:38.230 --> 01:01:38.240 align:start position:0%
facility so we add here that they also
 
01:01:40.630 --> 01:01:40.640 align:start position:0%
come to our office um we've been asking
 
01:01:44.309 --> 01:01:44.319 align:start position:0%
for these records for some time if the
 
01:01:47.470 --> 01:01:47.480 align:start position:0%
OCA gets those site visits not only do
 
01:01:50.750 --> 01:01:50.760 align:start position:0%
you have bcbh on it you have OCA eyes on
 
01:01:53.150 --> 01:01:53.160 align:start position:0%
it to also potentially pick up on issues
 
01:01:55.910 --> 01:01:55.920 align:start position:0%
to bring to the Forefront um so that's
 
01:01:58.269 --> 01:01:58.279 align:start position:0%
another level of protection built in as
 
01:02:00.470 --> 01:02:00.480 align:start position:0%
well as um the next section we're going
 
01:02:01.430 --> 01:02:01.440 align:start position:0%
to talk
 
01:02:04.950 --> 01:02:04.960 align:start position:0%
about by increasing not the frequency
 
01:02:09.029 --> 01:02:09.039 align:start position:0%
but the recording of those monthly dcyf
 
01:02:11.589 --> 01:02:11.599 align:start position:0%
caseworker visits that already happens
 
01:02:15.230 --> 01:02:15.240 align:start position:0%
again more reporting more eyes more
 
01:02:17.789 --> 01:02:17.799 align:start position:0%
potential for those additional
 
01:02:19.589 --> 01:02:19.599 align:start position:0%
non-mandatory visits to potentially
 
01:02:23.430 --> 01:02:23.440 align:start position:0%
happen so so so I'm good with that uh I
 
01:02:26.430 --> 01:02:26.440 align:start position:0%
I think the balance is you know uh you
 
01:02:29.870 --> 01:02:29.880 align:start position:0%
know privacy and administrative overhead
 
01:02:32.589 --> 01:02:32.599 align:start position:0%
with uh TR transparency and the need to
 
01:02:35.710 --> 01:02:35.720 align:start position:0%
know clearly the OCA has a need to know
 
01:02:38.390 --> 01:02:38.400 align:start position:0%
and is able to handle the privacy issues
 
01:02:41.150 --> 01:02:41.160 align:start position:0%
so having access to the reports I think
 
01:02:43.870 --> 01:02:43.880 align:start position:0%
that's great I just wouldn't want to be
 
01:02:46.870 --> 01:02:46.880 align:start position:0%
sloppy about who else starts to get them
 
01:02:48.710 --> 01:02:48.720 align:start position:0%
because I think there's sensitive
 
01:02:51.950 --> 01:02:51.960 align:start position:0%
information in there right 100% in our
 
01:02:53.390 --> 01:02:53.400 align:start position:0%
statute everything is completely
 
01:02:55.230 --> 01:02:55.240 align:start position:0%
confidential so that is the place to
 
01:03:06.950 --> 01:03:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:11.990 --> 01:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
eyes so next on page three line six of
 
01:03:14.710 --> 01:03:14.720 align:start position:0%
the amendment uh this changes the
 
01:03:16.829 --> 01:03:16.839 align:start position:0%
language of no placement out this is
 
01:03:19.349 --> 01:03:19.359 align:start position:0%
what Lisa spoke to earlier regarding uh
 
01:03:21.990 --> 01:03:22.000 align:start position:0%
no placement out of region shall occur
 
01:03:25.190 --> 01:03:25.200 align:start position:0%
after January 1 however this our
 
01:03:27.029 --> 01:03:27.039 align:start position:0%
proposed Lang anguage is that no
 
01:03:29.470 --> 01:03:29.480 align:start position:0%
placement outside of New England shall
 
01:03:32.829 --> 01:03:32.839 align:start position:0%
occur without the approval of Jeff our
 
01:03:35.870 --> 01:03:35.880 align:start position:0%
our DCF director um he should have eyes
 
01:03:38.230 --> 01:03:38.240 align:start position:0%
and and know who who is being sent out
 
01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:39.750 align:start position:0%
and and know who who is being sent out
of

01:03:39.750 --> 01:03:39.760 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:42.390 align:start position:0%
of
regen

01:03:42.390 --> 01:03:42.400 align:start position:0%
regen
 
01:03:45.510 --> 01:03:45.520 align:start position:0%
okay improv that that's an excellent
 
01:03:48.230 --> 01:03:48.240 align:start position:0%
Improvement I just wonder uh if somebody
 
01:03:51.430 --> 01:03:51.440 align:start position:0%
was filling in as an interim would this
 
01:03:55.190 --> 01:03:55.200 align:start position:0%
law allow an interim to act or the and
 
01:04:09.309 --> 01:04:09.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:13.470 --> 01:04:13.480 align:start position:0%
does so moving on to line 11 of Page
 
01:04:16.029 --> 01:04:16.039 align:start position:0%
Three this is again the OCA will not
 
01:04:19.150 --> 01:04:19.160 align:start position:0%
agree with this and I I understand line
 
01:04:21.589 --> 01:04:21.599 align:start position:0%
yes you agree with line 11 and
 
01:04:25.510 --> 01:04:25.520 align:start position:0%
12 um however down to line 20 not as
 
01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:26.549 align:start position:0%
12 um however down to line 20 not as
much

01:04:26.549 --> 01:04:26.559 align:start position:0%
much
 
01:04:30.349 --> 01:04:30.359 align:start position:0%
um so the reason I'll start at the top
 
01:04:33.549 --> 01:04:33.559 align:start position:0%
we this is again limiting the number or
 
01:04:33.559 --> 01:04:34.589 align:start position:0%
we this is again limiting the number or
the

01:04:34.589 --> 01:04:34.599 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:04:37.630 --> 01:04:37.640 align:start position:0%
the the categories I guess of which the
 
01:04:40.829 --> 01:04:40.839 align:start position:0%
children fall under as to who we go and
 
01:04:45.589 --> 01:04:45.599 align:start position:0%
visit and that is 169 b c and
 
01:04:48.430 --> 01:04:48.440 align:start position:0%
d we will see them or our staff will see
 
01:04:51.470 --> 01:04:51.480 align:start position:0%
them at least on a monthly basis um
 
01:04:54.230 --> 01:04:54.240 align:start position:0%
however as if you and I know you're
 
01:04:56.029 --> 01:04:56.039 align:start position:0%
going to read this but if you look at
 
01:04:57.870 --> 01:04:57.880 align:start position:0%
how it was proposed versus how it looks
 
01:05:01.190 --> 01:05:01.200 align:start position:0%
now we removed essentially a lot of the
 
01:05:04.789 --> 01:05:04.799 align:start position:0%
checklist that was in the the language
 
01:05:07.109 --> 01:05:07.119 align:start position:0%
and it would move to a checklist that we
 
01:05:09.150 --> 01:05:09.160 align:start position:0%
would work with the OCA on but it's not
 
01:05:11.190 --> 01:05:11.200 align:start position:0%
in statute and some of that is because
 
01:05:15.069 --> 01:05:15.079 align:start position:0%
we did have concerns with um some of the
 
01:05:17.109 --> 01:05:17.119 align:start position:0%
language it required leadership meet
 
01:05:19.150 --> 01:05:19.160 align:start position:0%
with us
 
01:05:21.190 --> 01:05:21.200 align:start position:0%
and you know the definition of
 
01:05:24.630 --> 01:05:24.640 align:start position:0%
leadership the the definition of uh who
 
01:05:27.950 --> 01:05:27.960 align:start position:0%
would be called leadership and then
 
01:05:31.670 --> 01:05:31.680 align:start position:0%
also requiring a third party to to meet
 
01:05:33.309 --> 01:05:33.319 align:start position:0%
with us so we wanted to make sure that
 
01:05:36.870 --> 01:05:36.880 align:start position:0%
it allowed us some some leniency on who
 
01:05:38.349 --> 01:05:38.359 align:start position:0%
we met with and who we felt was
 
01:05:40.829 --> 01:05:40.839 align:start position:0%
appropriate to meet with and I say we
 
01:05:43.309 --> 01:05:43.319 align:start position:0%
the the real people doing the real work
 
01:05:51.269 --> 01:05:51.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:55.630 --> 01:05:55.640 align:start position:0%
that okay on line 17 the use of the
 
01:05:58.870 --> 01:05:58.880 align:start position:0%
forras safe place is mentioned uh who
 
01:06:01.670 --> 01:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
who determines uh what a safe place is
 
01:06:05.230 --> 01:06:05.240 align:start position:0%
and does that beg to be
 
01:06:07.510 --> 01:06:07.520 align:start position:0%
defined so I'm not a subject matter
 
01:06:09.630 --> 01:06:09.640 align:start position:0%
expert on that I would assume that would
 
01:06:12.309 --> 01:06:12.319 align:start position:0%
be the case worker and the youth would
 
01:06:14.549 --> 01:06:14.559 align:start position:0%
kind of the youth is so so when you guys
 
01:06:17.029 --> 01:06:17.039 align:start position:0%
go away and and rework some of these
 
01:06:19.789 --> 01:06:19.799 align:start position:0%
comments would you would you just have a
 
01:06:22.230 --> 01:06:22.240 align:start position:0%
conversation about whether or not this
 
01:06:24.150 --> 01:06:24.160 align:start position:0%
should be more clear about who makes a
 
01:06:27.150 --> 01:06:27.160 align:start position:0%
determination of a safe place I I I I'm
 
01:06:28.710 --> 01:06:28.720 align:start position:0%
okay with the concept the place should
 
01:06:31.230 --> 01:06:31.240 align:start position:0%
be safe but it leads to the question of
 
01:06:33.309 --> 01:06:33.319 align:start position:0%
well who makes the determination does
 
01:06:36.029 --> 01:06:36.039 align:start position:0%
the does the patient say I don't feel
 
01:06:37.910 --> 01:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
safe in this place and even though it's
 
01:06:40.230 --> 01:06:40.240 align:start position:0%
safe I mean I just want some clarity
 
01:06:43.390 --> 01:06:43.400 align:start position:0%
there um I I agree with the concept and
 
01:06:46.029 --> 01:06:46.039 align:start position:0%
then and then the second part of that is
 
01:06:48.870 --> 01:06:48.880 align:start position:0%
um I you and I had talked earlier and I
 
01:06:52.630 --> 01:06:52.640 align:start position:0%
I I I suggested that perhaps we could
 
01:06:54.510 --> 01:06:54.520 align:start position:0%
insert some language that would allow
 
01:06:56.430 --> 01:06:56.440 align:start position:0%
video conferencing
 
01:06:58.750 --> 01:06:58.760 align:start position:0%
um and there's no video conference
 
01:07:00.430 --> 01:07:00.440 align:start position:0%
mentioned in here and and there's a
 
01:07:02.510 --> 01:07:02.520 align:start position:0%
reason for not having it I'm sure there
 
01:07:06.710 --> 01:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
is um however I am going to swap
 
01:07:09.190 --> 01:07:09.200 align:start position:0%
out can I just respond respond to the
 
01:07:11.630 --> 01:07:11.640 align:start position:0%
first first piece that you pointed out
 
01:07:15.390 --> 01:07:15.400 align:start position:0%
here about the safe space um I conduct
 
01:07:16.990 --> 01:07:17.000 align:start position:0%
these visits on behalf of the OCA with
 
01:07:19.549 --> 01:07:19.559 align:start position:0%
my staff as well so my staff go out and
 
01:07:20.789 --> 01:07:20.799 align:start position:0%
conduct visits and meet with children
 
01:07:23.069 --> 01:07:23.079 align:start position:0%
that's how we uncovered bled so in doing
 
01:07:24.950 --> 01:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
those and this is the reason why this
 
01:07:25.870 --> 01:07:25.880 align:start position:0%
language is in here here and the
 
01:07:28.269 --> 01:07:28.279 align:start position:0%
expectation of a social worker would be
 
01:07:30.589 --> 01:07:30.599 align:start position:0%
to meet with a child and say I'm looking
 
01:07:32.309 --> 01:07:32.319 align:start position:0%
to have a confidential conversation with
 
01:07:34.990 --> 01:07:35.000 align:start position:0%
you where you can speak to me openly
 
01:07:37.990 --> 01:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
about what is happening for you in this
 
01:07:41.109 --> 01:07:41.119 align:start position:0%
program said worker brings them to a
 
01:07:42.510 --> 01:07:42.520 align:start position:0%
conference room when they sit down in
 
01:07:44.349 --> 01:07:44.359 align:start position:0%
this conference room do you feel this is
 
01:07:46.309 --> 01:07:46.319 align:start position:0%
a place that you can share openly with
 
01:07:48.349 --> 01:07:48.359 align:start position:0%
me or are you concerned that others will
 
01:07:49.829 --> 01:07:49.839 align:start position:0%
overhear a conversation and we need to
 
01:07:51.750 --> 01:07:51.760 align:start position:0%
relocate to somewhere else so that is
 
01:07:53.630 --> 01:07:53.640 align:start position:0%
when defining that safe space that
 
01:07:56.190 --> 01:07:56.200 align:start position:0%
conversation should be happening before
 
01:07:58.230 --> 01:07:58.240 align:start position:0%
they go into detail about how that child
 
01:08:15.870 --> 01:08:15.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:19.309 --> 01:08:19.319 align:start position:0%
visit I'm just I'm just saying I'd like
 
01:08:22.590 --> 01:08:22.600 align:start position:0%
I I I think this BS the possibility of
 
01:08:27.149 --> 01:08:27.159 align:start position:0%
needing to be uh clear on who makes the
 
01:08:29.430 --> 01:08:29.440 align:start position:0%
determination the final determination
 
01:08:31.349 --> 01:08:31.359 align:start position:0%
that the place is safe so that they can
 
01:08:34.829 --> 01:08:34.839 align:start position:0%
go ahead and do the interview and uh and
 
01:08:36.749 --> 01:08:36.759 align:start position:0%
I open the question are there any
 
01:08:39.229 --> 01:08:39.239 align:start position:0%
standards that we should mention around
 
01:08:41.189 --> 01:08:41.199 align:start position:0%
what a what view depending on if it's a
 
01:08:43.390 --> 01:08:43.400 align:start position:0%
juvenile case or a child protection case
 
01:08:46.550 --> 01:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
is meeting in person with the child in a
 
01:08:48.309 --> 01:08:48.319 align:start position:0%
place that they have worked together
 
01:08:51.229 --> 01:08:51.239 align:start position:0%
before coming out to reserve to have a
 
01:08:53.709 --> 01:08:53.719 align:start position:0%
private room set up in case you know if
 
01:08:55.669 --> 01:08:55.679 align:start position:0%
if a roommate is present in the room
 
01:08:57.229 --> 01:08:57.239 align:start position:0%
some place where they can meet with the
 
01:09:02.470 --> 01:09:02.480 align:start position:0%
child in a safe secure for both parties
 
01:09:06.229 --> 01:09:06.239 align:start position:0%
for everyone to feel open and uh ready
 
01:09:08.030 --> 01:09:08.040 align:start position:0%
to have these open transparent
 
01:09:09.749 --> 01:09:09.759 align:start position:0%
conversations so that's already
 
01:09:13.630 --> 01:09:13.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:16.110 --> 01:09:16.120 align:start position:0%
policy this is a another question for
 
01:09:19.229 --> 01:09:19.239 align:start position:0%
the department so the case workers are
 
01:09:22.430 --> 01:09:22.440 align:start position:0%
going out and monthly and they do that
 
01:09:25.669 --> 01:09:25.679 align:start position:0%
now is that correct they go monthly the
 
01:09:27.950 --> 01:09:27.960 align:start position:0%
facilities to all the facilities and the
 
01:09:27.960 --> 01:09:29.669 align:start position:0%
facilities to all the facilities and the
foster

01:09:29.669 --> 01:09:29.679 align:start position:0%
foster
 
01:09:32.789 --> 01:09:32.799 align:start position:0%
homes to meet with the children so if if
 
01:09:34.309 --> 01:09:34.319 align:start position:0%
there's no children in that facility no
 
01:09:36.430 --> 01:09:36.440 align:start position:0%
the casew worker in the jppo is going
 
01:09:40.550 --> 01:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
out in person to the res the residential
 
01:09:42.550 --> 01:09:42.560 align:start position:0%
placement where the child is located yes
 
01:09:43.910 --> 01:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
to meet with
 
01:09:47.630 --> 01:09:47.640 align:start position:0%
them what happens if they go
 
01:09:51.269 --> 01:09:51.279 align:start position:0%
out and they have a concern to meet with
 
01:09:54.590 --> 01:09:54.600 align:start position:0%
the child and they have a concern about
 
01:09:55.950 --> 01:09:55.960 align:start position:0%
the facility
 
01:09:58.350 --> 01:09:58.360 align:start position:0%
how does that interact with the
 
01:10:01.270 --> 01:10:01.280 align:start position:0%
certification um staff do they come can
 
01:10:03.750 --> 01:10:03.760 align:start position:0%
do they have an obligation to come back
 
01:10:08.070 --> 01:10:08.080 align:start position:0%
and report that they felt something
 
01:10:11.510 --> 01:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
was not right
 
01:10:14.350 --> 01:10:14.360 align:start position:0%
um what what's the interaction there
 
01:10:18.070 --> 01:10:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:20.870 --> 01:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
monthly sure and there's many layers to
 
01:10:23.590 --> 01:10:23.600 align:start position:0%
that so each child who is played say out
 
01:10:26.149 --> 01:10:26.159 align:start position:0%
of state is also under the confines of
 
01:10:29.470 --> 01:10:29.480 align:start position:0%
either ICPC or icj so there's an
 
01:10:31.630 --> 01:10:31.640 align:start position:0%
interstate compact in which there is a
 
01:10:35.030 --> 01:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
home state uh juvenile probation system
 
01:10:37.270 --> 01:10:37.280 align:start position:0%
as well as a child protection system so
 
01:10:39.229 --> 01:10:39.239 align:start position:0%
if it was something um about that
 
01:10:42.030 --> 01:10:42.040 align:start position:0%
Resident placement they would alert the
 
01:10:45.310 --> 01:10:45.320 align:start position:0%
local CPS local JJ as to what is
 
01:10:48.149 --> 01:10:48.159 align:start position:0%
occurring in that location if it's about
 
01:10:50.189 --> 01:10:50.199 align:start position:0%
the child themselves so yeah they would
 
01:10:53.030 --> 01:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
also in addition to uh alerting the
 
01:10:55.870 --> 01:10:55.880 align:start position:0%
local Child Protection Agency
 
01:10:58.310 --> 01:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
of the state where the of the placement
 
01:11:01.870 --> 01:11:01.880 align:start position:0%
facility is they would also alerting the
 
01:11:04.870 --> 01:11:04.880 align:start position:0%
case itself here in New Hampshire so the
 
01:11:06.510 --> 01:11:06.520 align:start position:0%
the worker would alert their their
 
01:11:09.030 --> 01:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
supervisor if necessary they would call
 
01:11:11.870 --> 01:11:11.880 align:start position:0%
for an immediate exp parte a phone call
 
01:11:14.270 --> 01:11:14.280 align:start position:0%
to the judge for an emergency hearing on
 
01:11:16.149 --> 01:11:16.159 align:start position:0%
the placement of this child so there's
 
01:11:19.350 --> 01:11:19.360 align:start position:0%
many safety precautions and safety
 
01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:20.950 align:start position:0%
many safety precautions and safety
um

01:11:20.950 --> 01:11:20.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:25.350 --> 01:11:25.360 align:start position:0%
uh reactive um means to make sure that
 
01:11:26.750 --> 01:11:26.760 align:start position:0%
everyone knows that there's something
 
01:11:28.870 --> 01:11:28.880 align:start position:0%
going on in this facility even if it's
 
01:11:30.630 --> 01:11:30.640 align:start position:0%
not related to the child
 
01:11:33.990 --> 01:11:34.000 align:start position:0%
itself I do want to clarify um the ICPC
 
01:11:36.669 --> 01:11:36.679 align:start position:0%
process the ICPC process does not assign
 
01:11:38.270 --> 01:11:38.280 align:start position:0%
a social worker from the state that the
 
01:11:40.390 --> 01:11:40.400 align:start position:0%
child's in to do monitoring visits if
 
01:11:41.790 --> 01:11:41.800 align:start position:0%
the child's in residential that only
 
01:11:43.629 --> 01:11:43.639 align:start position:0%
stands if the child is placed in a
 
01:11:46.870 --> 01:11:46.880 align:start position:0%
foster home um so icj is separate for
 
01:11:50.310 --> 01:11:50.320 align:start position:0%
juvenile justice but for ICPC placements
 
01:11:51.950 --> 01:11:51.960 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire would be the sending
 
01:11:54.310 --> 01:11:54.320 align:start position:0%
State the receiving state would only
 
01:11:56.229 --> 01:11:56.239 align:start position:0%
assign if that child is in a home
 
01:11:57.669 --> 01:11:57.679 align:start position:0%
setting if they're in a residential
 
01:12:00.229 --> 01:12:00.239 align:start position:0%
setting the cpsw from the state of New
 
01:12:02.110 --> 01:12:02.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is still the assigned case
 
01:12:03.709 --> 01:12:03.719 align:start position:0%
worker they are responsible for going
 
01:12:05.629 --> 01:12:05.639 align:start position:0%
out for those in-person visits to the
 
01:12:09.550 --> 01:12:09.560 align:start position:0%
child and it is as mentioned as um Susan
 
01:12:12.390 --> 01:12:12.400 align:start position:0%
mentioned it is in current policy
 
01:12:14.669 --> 01:12:14.679 align:start position:0%
current dcif policy that they are to
 
01:12:17.030 --> 01:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
immediately alert their supervisor um
 
01:12:19.709 --> 01:12:19.719 align:start position:0%
but it does not there is no clear chain
 
01:12:21.550 --> 01:12:21.560 align:start position:0%
of command beyond alerting their
 
01:12:24.470 --> 01:12:24.480 align:start position:0%
supervisor in that policy so as we speak
 
01:12:26.149 --> 01:12:26.159 align:start position:0%
here about developing a standard
 
01:12:28.030 --> 01:12:28.040 align:start position:0%
operating procedure that are some those
 
01:12:29.149 --> 01:12:29.159 align:start position:0%
are some of the pieces that we would
 
01:12:31.149 --> 01:12:31.159 align:start position:0%
look to make a bit more clear how does
 
01:12:34.030 --> 01:12:34.040 align:start position:0%
that messaging then get over to the bcbh
 
01:12:35.669 --> 01:12:35.679 align:start position:0%
team and not just live with that worker
 
01:12:37.270 --> 01:12:37.280 align:start position:0%
and that supervisor well and
 
01:12:38.669 --> 01:12:38.679 align:start position:0%
representative Walmer I think your
 
01:12:40.990 --> 01:12:41.000 align:start position:0%
question gets actually to the heart of
 
01:12:43.470 --> 01:12:43.480 align:start position:0%
the purpose of this bill and sort of
 
01:12:46.750 --> 01:12:46.760 align:start position:0%
what came out of bledo the discovery was
 
01:12:50.790 --> 01:12:50.800 align:start position:0%
made that those worker visits so again
 
01:12:52.270 --> 01:12:52.280 align:start position:0%
we talked about sort of the buckets
 
01:12:54.110 --> 01:12:54.120 align:start position:0%
there's the BCB certification team
 
01:12:56.590 --> 01:12:56.600 align:start position:0%
visits that's about CER the facility
 
01:12:59.110 --> 01:12:59.120 align:start position:0%
there are these dcyf or jppo worker
 
01:13:00.870 --> 01:13:00.880 align:start position:0%
visits which are there assigned to that
 
01:13:03.189 --> 01:13:03.199 align:start position:0%
kid and then the court oversight piece
 
01:13:05.750 --> 01:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
we haven't gotten to yet but so what was
 
01:13:07.709 --> 01:13:07.719 align:start position:0%
is happening or at least was happening
 
01:13:09.910 --> 01:13:09.920 align:start position:0%
in some places including bledo the
 
01:13:12.310 --> 01:13:12.320 align:start position:0%
worker assigned to the child
 
01:13:15.990 --> 01:13:16.000 align:start position:0%
went 15minute visit laid eyes on that
 
01:13:18.430 --> 01:13:18.440 align:start position:0%
child in a little conference room didn't
 
01:13:20.430 --> 01:13:20.440 align:start position:0%
see any part of the facility didn't talk
 
01:13:24.030 --> 01:13:24.040 align:start position:0%
to anybody else at the facility and that
 
01:13:27.270 --> 01:13:27.280 align:start position:0%
was the issue that how would they have
 
01:13:29.390 --> 01:13:29.400 align:start position:0%
seen all the red flags that the OCA saw
 
01:13:30.990 --> 01:13:31.000 align:start position:0%
because they literally walked in walked
 
01:13:32.950 --> 01:13:32.960 align:start position:0%
into a conference room 15 minutes eyes
 
01:13:34.830 --> 01:13:34.840 align:start position:0%
on that kid K everything's great got
 
01:13:38.149 --> 01:13:38.159 align:start position:0%
back on an airplane so that's why this
 
01:13:40.149 --> 01:13:40.159 align:start position:0%
piece of the bill is so important and
 
01:13:42.990 --> 01:13:43.000 align:start position:0%
why the original language is so crucial
 
01:13:45.350 --> 01:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
and why this amendment essentially
 
01:13:47.590 --> 01:13:47.600 align:start position:0%
undermines the entire purpose of the
 
01:13:50.709 --> 01:13:50.719 align:start position:0%
bill to avoid visits happening like that
 
01:13:52.430 --> 01:13:52.440 align:start position:0%
anymore if you're just going to see a
 
01:13:54.470 --> 01:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
kid potentially one you've never even
 
01:13:56.830 --> 01:13:56.840 align:start position:0%
met before say you know how how are you
 
01:13:58.629 --> 01:13:58.639 align:start position:0%
doing how's your permanency plan how's
 
01:14:01.149 --> 01:14:01.159 align:start position:0%
your education how's your treatment good
 
01:14:03.870 --> 01:14:03.880 align:start position:0%
good and then don't actually talk to the
 
01:14:05.430 --> 01:14:05.440 align:start position:0%
treatment provider don't talk to the
 
01:14:07.270 --> 01:14:07.280 align:start position:0%
direct service staff that's actually
 
01:14:09.910 --> 01:14:09.920 align:start position:0%
with this kid all day don't talk to any
 
01:14:14.149 --> 01:14:14.159 align:start position:0%
other person or adult in that facility
 
01:14:15.470 --> 01:14:15.480 align:start position:0%
that's where these things happen that's
 
01:14:18.870 --> 01:14:18.880 align:start position:0%
where your liability is in a foster home
 
01:14:20.629 --> 01:14:20.639 align:start position:0%
they go in they talk to the foster
 
01:14:21.990 --> 01:14:22.000 align:start position:0%
parents they talk to the other kids in
 
01:14:23.229 --> 01:14:23.239 align:start position:0%
the home they're going to talk to the
 
01:14:25.790 --> 01:14:25.800 align:start position:0%
teacher the therapist
 
01:14:28.310 --> 01:14:28.320 align:start position:0%
you know so this is really intended to
 
01:14:31.310 --> 01:14:31.320 align:start position:0%
mirror the level of contact and
 
01:14:32.669 --> 01:14:32.679 align:start position:0%
information you're Gathering about a
 
01:14:34.669 --> 01:14:34.679 align:start position:0%
particular child who is on your case
 
01:14:37.030 --> 01:14:37.040 align:start position:0%
load into that residential setting
 
01:14:38.390 --> 01:14:38.400 align:start position:0%
because the Direct Care staff is like
 
01:14:39.910 --> 01:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
the foster parent the leadership is
 
01:14:41.950 --> 01:14:41.960 align:start position:0%
setting the rules the therapist is the
 
01:14:44.750 --> 01:14:44.760 align:start position:0%
therapist so that's the very heart of
 
01:14:46.189 --> 01:14:46.199 align:start position:0%
this bill and I'm glad that you asked
 
01:14:48.430 --> 01:14:48.440 align:start position:0%
that question because that is the
 
01:14:50.750 --> 01:14:50.760 align:start position:0%
problem with way things work now and why
 
01:14:52.229 --> 01:14:52.239 align:start position:0%
we felt it's so important that it needs
 
01:14:55.070 --> 01:14:55.080 align:start position:0%
to be a lot clearer in law because the
 
01:14:56.629 --> 01:14:56.639 align:start position:0%
policy already says that stuff but
 
01:14:58.149 --> 01:14:58.159 align:start position:0%
that's not what was happening well and
 
01:15:00.149 --> 01:15:00.159 align:start position:0%
and to make sure it's clear um for those
 
01:15:01.430 --> 01:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
who maybe haven't had an opportunity to
 
01:15:04.430 --> 01:15:04.440 align:start position:0%
read the full bledo report there were as
 
01:15:06.510 --> 01:15:06.520 align:start position:0%
Lisa mentioned workers that had gone out
 
01:15:08.229 --> 01:15:08.239 align:start position:0%
once a month for the entirety of the
 
01:15:09.910 --> 01:15:09.920 align:start position:0%
placement of the two children that we
 
01:15:12.189 --> 01:15:12.199 align:start position:0%
met with and not one concern was
 
01:15:14.750 --> 01:15:14.760 align:start position:0%
documented in their case record not one
 
01:15:16.750 --> 01:15:16.760 align:start position:0%
about this facility and if you read the
 
01:15:18.830 --> 01:15:18.840 align:start position:0%
the lengthy concerns that we were able
 
01:15:21.669 --> 01:15:21.679 align:start position:0%
to observe in one visit we're noticing
 
01:15:23.270 --> 01:15:23.280 align:start position:0%
that the the visits that are happening
 
01:15:25.070 --> 01:15:25.080 align:start position:0%
by the workers right now are not
 
01:15:26.750 --> 01:15:26.760 align:start position:0%
capturing the same level of
 
01:15:28.910 --> 01:15:28.920 align:start position:0%
information are the case workers
 
01:15:32.669 --> 01:15:32.679 align:start position:0%
required to yes meet with the child in
 
01:15:37.590 --> 01:15:37.600 align:start position:0%
a safe place are they also required to
 
01:15:40.830 --> 01:15:40.840 align:start position:0%
see where the child the child's sleeping
 
01:15:43.149 --> 01:15:43.159 align:start position:0%
Arrangement at every
 
01:15:46.310 --> 01:15:46.320 align:start position:0%
visit yes they tour the living quarters
 
01:15:48.830 --> 01:15:48.840 align:start position:0%
of that child as well as all common
 
01:15:52.510 --> 01:15:52.520 align:start position:0%
areas that that child um goes on a
 
01:15:55.110 --> 01:15:55.120 align:start position:0%
day-to-day basis whether it the library
 
01:15:58.030 --> 01:15:58.040 align:start position:0%
the gym the
 
01:16:00.270 --> 01:16:00.280 align:start position:0%
cafeteria um and again if we're I guess
 
01:16:02.590 --> 01:16:02.600 align:start position:0%
we're now moving on to I thought we were
 
01:16:04.430 --> 01:16:04.440 align:start position:0%
still talking about just the safe place
 
01:16:06.270 --> 01:16:06.280 align:start position:0%
but it appears that we're talking also
 
01:16:08.669 --> 01:16:08.679 align:start position:0%
about the the visit itself the reason
 
01:16:10.510 --> 01:16:10.520 align:start position:0%
why we had concerns about what was
 
01:16:14.629 --> 01:16:14.639 align:start position:0%
labeled in the visit um in the original
 
01:16:18.070 --> 01:16:18.080 align:start position:0%
1573 was a lot of shells a lot of shells
 
01:16:20.149 --> 01:16:20.159 align:start position:0%
that were beyond the control of the
 
01:16:22.270 --> 01:16:22.280 align:start position:0%
casew worker and put the casew worker in
 
01:16:24.310 --> 01:16:24.320 align:start position:0%
a position of being being a quality
 
01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:25.669 align:start position:0%
a position of being being a quality
assurance

01:16:25.669 --> 01:16:25.679 align:start position:0%
assurance
 
01:16:29.430 --> 01:16:29.440 align:start position:0%
um representative which they're not um
 
01:16:31.310 --> 01:16:31.320 align:start position:0%
of course when they're in the facility
 
01:16:33.629 --> 01:16:33.639 align:start position:0%
their heads need to be on a swivel they
 
01:16:35.629 --> 01:16:35.639 align:start position:0%
need to be taking notice of everything
 
01:16:38.310 --> 01:16:38.320 align:start position:0%
that is going on in that facility but
 
01:16:39.590 --> 01:16:39.600 align:start position:0%
there were a lot of shells that were
 
01:16:42.149 --> 01:16:42.159 align:start position:0%
beyond their control such as tour of the
 
01:16:45.629 --> 01:16:45.639 align:start position:0%
entire facility each time they go every
 
01:16:47.950 --> 01:16:47.960 align:start position:0%
30 days they need to tour the entire
 
01:16:51.430 --> 01:16:51.440 align:start position:0%
facility Way Beyond just the facility of
 
01:16:53.830 --> 01:16:53.840 align:start position:0%
the uh portion that the child is so if
 
01:16:56.110 --> 01:16:56.120 align:start position:0%
it's a co-ed they be look at you know
 
01:16:58.709 --> 01:16:58.719 align:start position:0%
acres and Acres of property that is
 
01:17:02.470 --> 01:17:02.480 align:start position:0%
beyond what is their child's needs what
 
01:17:04.550 --> 01:17:04.560 align:start position:0%
their child is exposed to on a daily
 
01:17:07.350 --> 01:17:07.360 align:start position:0%
basis they would be shall discussed with
 
01:17:09.750 --> 01:17:09.760 align:start position:0%
leadership the program culture and
 
01:17:12.189 --> 01:17:12.199 align:start position:0%
therapeutic program they shall have
 
01:17:14.709 --> 01:17:14.719 align:start position:0%
discussions with the program Direct Care
 
01:17:17.270 --> 01:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
staff they shall have discussions with
 
01:17:20.310 --> 01:17:20.320 align:start position:0%
the Clinical Director and or therapeutic
 
01:17:22.390 --> 01:17:22.400 align:start position:0%
provider about the program
 
01:17:25.750 --> 01:17:25.760 align:start position:0%
culture therapeutic programming so again
 
01:17:28.430 --> 01:17:28.440 align:start position:0%
things that go beyond just the what's
 
01:17:30.830 --> 01:17:30.840 align:start position:0%
going on with the child things about the
 
01:17:33.030 --> 01:17:33.040 align:start position:0%
entire facility which again is putting
 
01:17:35.550 --> 01:17:35.560 align:start position:0%
us we feel in a liability issue in terms
 
01:17:38.110 --> 01:17:38.120 align:start position:0%
of the the shells that are involved and
 
01:17:40.350 --> 01:17:40.360 align:start position:0%
that's why in our in our Amendment it
 
01:17:43.149 --> 01:17:43.159 align:start position:0%
was much more talking about the child
 
01:17:45.750 --> 01:17:45.760 align:start position:0%
itself themselves right discussing their
 
01:17:47.790 --> 01:17:47.800 align:start position:0%
treatment their education their
 
01:17:49.629 --> 01:17:49.639 align:start position:0%
transition um
 
01:17:51.990 --> 01:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
planning and what is also already
 
01:17:54.830 --> 01:17:54.840 align:start position:0%
occurring which occurs either live in
 
01:17:57.229 --> 01:17:57.239 align:start position:0%
like through a teams or through written
 
01:17:59.870 --> 01:17:59.880 align:start position:0%
correspondence is updates is being part
 
01:18:02.350 --> 01:18:02.360 align:start position:0%
of their therapeutic treatment uh
 
01:18:04.470 --> 01:18:04.480 align:start position:0%
meetings talking with the clinical
 
01:18:06.430 --> 01:18:06.440 align:start position:0%
placement provider speaking with the
 
01:18:08.910 --> 01:18:08.920 align:start position:0%
therapeutic providers and educational
 
01:18:11.750 --> 01:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
providers preferably in real time but at
 
01:18:14.350 --> 01:18:14.360 align:start position:0%
least by written correspondence as
 
01:18:16.070 --> 01:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
opposed to the original bill which said
 
01:18:18.310 --> 01:18:18.320 align:start position:0%
that all of that was happening in person
 
01:18:21.350 --> 01:18:21.360 align:start position:0%
during that 30-day uh tour because
 
01:18:23.709 --> 01:18:23.719 align:start position:0%
sometimes those program meetings are not
 
01:18:26.790 --> 01:18:26.800 align:start position:0%
at the same time as that 30-day uh
 
01:18:28.149 --> 01:18:28.159 align:start position:0%
meeting with the child so they're
 
01:18:30.149 --> 01:18:30.159 align:start position:0%
focusing on the child at that 30-day
 
01:18:33.110 --> 01:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
visit and then in in addition of that
 
01:18:35.110 --> 01:18:35.120 align:start position:0%
they're being involved in the treatment
 
01:18:37.669 --> 01:18:37.679 align:start position:0%
team meetings whether it be by teams or
 
01:18:39.470 --> 01:18:39.480 align:start position:0%
through written correspondence through
 
01:18:41.830 --> 01:18:41.840 align:start position:0%
email so that's much more than just that
 
01:18:44.229 --> 01:18:44.239 align:start position:0%
30-day visit however the way the bill
 
01:18:46.310 --> 01:18:46.320 align:start position:0%
was written everything was to occur
 
01:18:50.990 --> 01:18:51.000 align:start position:0%
during that 30-day visit is why the um
 
01:18:53.950 --> 01:18:53.960 align:start position:0%
fiscal bill was so high in regards to
 
01:18:56.830 --> 01:18:56.840 align:start position:0%
first it was the cas worker each 30 days
 
01:18:59.550 --> 01:18:59.560 align:start position:0%
so that would require them to be uh at
 
01:19:01.790 --> 01:19:01.800 align:start position:0%
these locations for multiple days in
 
01:19:05.229 --> 01:19:05.239 align:start position:0%
order to be meeting with uh you know
 
01:19:08.669 --> 01:19:08.679 align:start position:0%
leadership the program Direct Care staff
 
01:19:10.550 --> 01:19:10.560 align:start position:0%
uh The Clinical Director the therapeutic
 
01:19:12.990 --> 01:19:13.000 align:start position:0%
provider so again the there were there
 
01:19:15.149 --> 01:19:15.159 align:start position:0%
were a lot of shells in that original
 
01:19:19.270 --> 01:19:19.280 align:start position:0%
Bill and so if if you look at the
 
01:19:22.149 --> 01:19:22.159 align:start position:0%
amendment that you all had last Monday
 
01:19:24.270 --> 01:19:24.280 align:start position:0%
that was agreed upon language between
 
01:19:27.310 --> 01:19:27.320 align:start position:0%
the o CA in the department last week
 
01:19:29.790 --> 01:19:29.800 align:start position:0%
that had vastly different language
 
01:19:33.030 --> 01:19:33.040 align:start position:0%
including agreed upon language limiting
 
01:19:34.990 --> 01:19:35.000 align:start position:0%
the facility visit to just be parts of
 
01:19:36.629 --> 01:19:36.639 align:start position:0%
the facility that the child had access
 
01:19:37.910 --> 01:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
to because we understood how they could
 
01:19:41.229 --> 01:19:41.239 align:start position:0%
misread that language and cut down some
 
01:19:43.950 --> 01:19:43.960 align:start position:0%
of it and this is completely new and
 
01:19:45.750 --> 01:19:45.760 align:start position:0%
different stripped down language that
 
01:19:47.629 --> 01:19:47.639 align:start position:0%
frankly doesn't even rise to the level
 
01:19:51.430 --> 01:19:51.440 align:start position:0%
of what is supposed to be happening now
 
01:19:54.790 --> 01:19:54.800 align:start position:0%
and the problem is that stuff was not
 
01:19:57.590 --> 01:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
not happening the seven visits to bledo
 
01:19:59.350 --> 01:19:59.360 align:start position:0%
were in a tiny little conference room
 
01:20:01.070 --> 01:20:01.080 align:start position:0%
they did not see where the children
 
01:20:02.189 --> 01:20:02.199 align:start position:0%
slept or they would have seen that they
 
01:20:05.990 --> 01:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
were on mattresses on the floor um so we
 
01:20:09.990 --> 01:20:10.000 align:start position:0%
appreciate that there is a balance but I
 
01:20:13.830 --> 01:20:13.840 align:start position:0%
find it very difficult to understand how
 
01:20:16.110 --> 01:20:16.120 align:start position:0%
talking to Direct Care staff who's
 
01:20:18.270 --> 01:20:18.280 align:start position:0%
providing the direct care to the child
 
01:20:20.430 --> 01:20:20.440 align:start position:0%
about how that kid is doing and what the
 
01:20:22.510 --> 01:20:22.520 align:start position:0%
the milu culture the millu is sort of
 
01:20:25.110 --> 01:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
the common space where children are all
 
01:20:27.430 --> 01:20:27.440 align:start position:0%
day doesn't relate directly to that
 
01:20:29.510 --> 01:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
child's care that's not a facility visit
 
01:20:32.990 --> 01:20:33.000 align:start position:0%
you're asking about the programming the
 
01:20:35.750 --> 01:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
discipline the education that that
 
01:20:38.629 --> 01:20:38.639 align:start position:0%
particular child is being provided by
 
01:20:40.950 --> 01:20:40.960 align:start position:0%
those people you are talking directly to
 
01:20:42.990 --> 01:20:43.000 align:start position:0%
so is it your position that this
 
01:20:45.590 --> 01:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
language includes all that smart Common
 
01:20:48.590 --> 01:20:48.600 align:start position:0%
Sense inspection it is our understanding
 
01:20:50.070 --> 01:20:50.080 align:start position:0%
that it's not happening now and if it's
 
01:20:51.590 --> 01:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
not clarified in language it's going to
 
01:20:54.470 --> 01:20:54.480 align:start position:0%
continue to not occur so I would argue
 
01:20:57.110 --> 01:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
that that's an assumption right I mean
 
01:20:59.229 --> 01:20:59.239 align:start position:0%
that that that that's an assumption but
 
01:21:01.590 --> 01:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
is there anything in this language that
 
01:21:04.430 --> 01:21:04.440 align:start position:0%
precludes the common sense inspection
 
01:21:07.629 --> 01:21:07.639 align:start position:0%
that you're saying is required I believe
 
01:21:09.149 --> 01:21:09.159 align:start position:0%
we're missing a lot of of really
 
01:21:10.590 --> 01:21:10.600 align:start position:0%
pertinent information I mean as simple
 
01:21:12.750 --> 01:21:12.760 align:start position:0%
as the discussion around the treatment
 
01:21:14.830 --> 01:21:14.840 align:start position:0%
team meetings that workers are to be
 
01:21:17.910 --> 01:21:17.920 align:start position:0%
engaging in our office received a notice
 
01:21:19.350 --> 01:21:19.360 align:start position:0%
within the past two weeks that workers
 
01:21:20.750 --> 01:21:20.760 align:start position:0%
are not attending those meetings on a
 
01:21:22.629 --> 01:21:22.639 align:start position:0%
regular basis it is to be assumed that
 
01:21:25.149 --> 01:21:25.159 align:start position:0%
they should be it is by Statute and and
 
01:21:26.910 --> 01:21:26.920 align:start position:0%
I'm not sorry by Statute by policy that
 
01:21:28.990 --> 01:21:29.000 align:start position:0%
they should be attending them it is not
 
01:21:30.790 --> 01:21:30.800 align:start position:0%
happening so again without that shall
 
01:21:32.270 --> 01:21:32.280 align:start position:0%
and by leaving something with a May or
 
01:21:35.669 --> 01:21:35.679 align:start position:0%
by pulling out the substance of it it
 
01:21:37.270 --> 01:21:37.280 align:start position:0%
may be an assumption that it's not going
 
01:21:39.030 --> 01:21:39.040 align:start position:0%
to happen but I also cannot assume it is
 
01:21:40.390 --> 01:21:40.400 align:start position:0%
going to happen I do not have enough
 
01:21:43.310 --> 01:21:43.320 align:start position:0%
evidence of be current behavior by the
 
01:21:45.310 --> 01:21:45.320 align:start position:0%
cpsws that this is what is actually
 
01:21:48.229 --> 01:21:48.239 align:start position:0%
going to occur and I just I wanted to
 
01:21:50.510 --> 01:21:50.520 align:start position:0%
point out to that the one part of this
 
01:21:52.189 --> 01:21:52.199 align:start position:0%
that was agreed to was that change to
 
01:21:55.149 --> 01:21:55.159 align:start position:0%
the first section uh spe specifying that
 
01:21:56.430 --> 01:21:56.440 align:start position:0%
these are only for court ordered
 
01:21:59.270 --> 01:21:59.280 align:start position:0%
placements under 169 b c and d which are
 
01:22:01.149 --> 01:22:01.159 align:start position:0%
already monthly visits that are
 
01:22:03.629 --> 01:22:03.639 align:start position:0%
currently happening already by taking
 
01:22:06.510 --> 01:22:06.520 align:start position:0%
out episode of treatment that should
 
01:22:09.750 --> 01:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
eliminate any new positions necessary or
 
01:22:12.430 --> 01:22:12.440 align:start position:0%
any new travel funds necessary because
 
01:22:14.510 --> 01:22:14.520 align:start position:0%
as has been repeatedly stated these
 
01:22:18.070 --> 01:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
monthly visits by case workers and jppo
 
01:22:21.270 --> 01:22:21.280 align:start position:0%
under BC and D already happened are
 
01:22:23.350 --> 01:22:23.360 align:start position:0%
already happening are already budgeted
 
01:22:27.310 --> 01:22:27.320 align:start position:0%
for the travels already happening um the
 
01:22:27.320 --> 01:22:28.870 align:start position:0%
for the travels already happening um the
the

01:22:28.870 --> 01:22:28.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:22:32.229 --> 01:22:32.239 align:start position:0%
additional conversations that were in
 
01:22:34.030 --> 01:22:34.040 align:start position:0%
the original Bill and frankly even the
 
01:22:35.669 --> 01:22:35.679 align:start position:0%
amendment you got last week which was
 
01:22:37.709 --> 01:22:37.719 align:start position:0%
agreed upon language that the OCA
 
01:22:42.070 --> 01:22:42.080 align:start position:0%
approved um really should not increase
 
01:22:43.990 --> 01:22:44.000 align:start position:0%
we're not asking them to do a facility
 
01:22:47.390 --> 01:22:47.400 align:start position:0%
visit at all and I went to Florida a
 
01:22:49.709 --> 01:22:49.719 align:start position:0%
couple months ago when we walked in it
 
01:22:51.629 --> 01:22:51.639 align:start position:0%
was a member of leadership who walked us
 
01:22:54.110 --> 01:22:54.120 align:start position:0%
to see the kid you go see the kid it's a
 
01:22:55.790 --> 01:22:55.800 align:start position:0%
direct service staff who's standing
 
01:22:57.510 --> 01:22:57.520 align:start position:0%
right there it's not like we're asking
 
01:22:59.830 --> 01:22:59.840 align:start position:0%
them to sit down for hours with
 
01:23:02.189 --> 01:23:02.199 align:start position:0%
PowerPoints when you go into a facility
 
01:23:04.750 --> 01:23:04.760 align:start position:0%
to see a child you are naturally and
 
01:23:06.950 --> 01:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
normally going to interact there's
 
01:23:08.709 --> 01:23:08.719 align:start position:0%
always a member of leadership present
 
01:23:09.830 --> 01:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
unless you're visiting in the middle of
 
01:23:10.910 --> 01:23:10.920 align:start position:0%
the night which I presume they're not
 
01:23:12.629 --> 01:23:12.639 align:start position:0%
doing there's always a member of
 
01:23:14.350 --> 01:23:14.360 align:start position:0%
therapeutic team on site it's a
 
01:23:16.790 --> 01:23:16.800 align:start position:0%
residential facility the children are
 
01:23:18.870 --> 01:23:18.880 align:start position:0%
secluded there every single person they
 
01:23:21.470 --> 01:23:21.480 align:start position:0%
interact with it's a 247 staffed
 
01:23:25.629 --> 01:23:25.639 align:start position:0%
facility it's not the I think the way
 
01:23:28.790 --> 01:23:28.800 align:start position:0%
it's being explained is again
 
01:23:32.750 --> 01:23:32.760 align:start position:0%
overreaching of really what OCA was
 
01:23:34.550 --> 01:23:34.560 align:start position:0%
asking for in the original bill that
 
01:23:36.709 --> 01:23:36.719 align:start position:0%
passed even in last week's Amendment
 
01:23:39.030 --> 01:23:39.040 align:start position:0%
this strips out everything and just
 
01:23:41.510 --> 01:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
leaves it to policy which we know is
 
01:23:43.430 --> 01:23:43.440 align:start position:0%
currently not being followed and is not
 
01:23:43.440 --> 01:23:47.030 align:start position:0%
currently not being followed and is not
protecting

01:23:47.030 --> 01:23:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:49.550 --> 01:23:49.560 align:start position:0%
children would you point out in the
 
01:23:52.390 --> 01:23:52.400 align:start position:0%
amendment from last week exactly what
 
01:23:55.590 --> 01:23:55.600 align:start position:0%
the were the agreed Bond language
 
01:23:58.229 --> 01:23:58.239 align:start position:0%
is yeah I got to be honest I didn't read
 
01:23:59.709 --> 01:23:59.719 align:start position:0%
last week's Amendment knowing that we
 
01:24:01.149 --> 01:24:01.159 align:start position:0%
were going to be doing representative
 
01:24:03.629 --> 01:24:03.639 align:start position:0%
Pearson's Amendment so I I'm looking at
 
01:24:07.229 --> 01:24:07.239 align:start position:0%
0980 8 Z is that we on the same
 
01:24:09.990 --> 01:24:10.000 align:start position:0%
Amendment yes that should be yeah so
 
01:24:12.590 --> 01:24:12.600 align:start position:0%
this was language that we had all
 
01:24:14.510 --> 01:24:14.520 align:start position:0%
hammered out
 
01:24:18.430 --> 01:24:18.440 align:start position:0%
together uh previously it is
 
01:24:23.310 --> 01:24:23.320 align:start position:0%
page two no page two
 
01:24:23.320 --> 01:24:24.950 align:start position:0%
page two no page two
yeah

01:24:24.950 --> 01:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:24:24.960 --> 01:24:26.510 align:start position:0%
yeah
section

01:24:26.510 --> 01:24:26.520 align:start position:0%
section
 
01:24:33.110 --> 01:24:33.120 align:start position:0%
three line n line 20 so starting at line
 
01:24:37.830 --> 01:24:37.840 align:start position:0%
20 to line 33 Okay is the language we
 
01:24:40.350 --> 01:24:40.360 align:start position:0%
all agreed on together after multiple
 
01:24:44.790 --> 01:24:44.800 align:start position:0%
meetings except for taking out just in
 
01:24:47.390 --> 01:24:47.400 align:start position:0%
line 21 or placement for an episode of
 
01:24:49.669 --> 01:24:49.679 align:start position:0%
treatment so that would have pulled in
 
01:24:52.030 --> 01:24:52.040 align:start position:0%
bcbh voluntarily placed kids and would
 
01:24:55.030 --> 01:24:55.040 align:start position:0%
have required additional people for sure
 
01:24:57.430 --> 01:24:57.440 align:start position:0%
we took that out no additional people
 
01:24:59.030 --> 01:24:59.040 align:start position:0%
should be needed these visits are
 
01:25:00.950 --> 01:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
happening and this language was in fact
 
01:25:03.590 --> 01:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
compromised language it is less than
 
01:25:05.629 --> 01:25:05.639 align:start position:0%
what was in the original bill as passed
 
01:25:08.189 --> 01:25:08.199 align:start position:0%
by the house we sat and had a productive
 
01:25:09.990 --> 01:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
conversation about where you know the
 
01:25:12.270 --> 01:25:12.280 align:start position:0%
entire facility versus what's
 
01:25:14.669 --> 01:25:14.679 align:start position:0%
accessible but still
 
01:25:17.030 --> 01:25:17.040 align:start position:0%
includes all of these important pieces
 
01:25:18.709 --> 01:25:18.719 align:start position:0%
of information that the worker should
 
01:25:21.189 --> 01:25:21.199 align:start position:0%
gather this directly relates to that
 
01:25:24.470 --> 01:25:24.480 align:start position:0%
child in that placement and this
 
01:25:26.550 --> 01:25:26.560 align:start position:0%
language today totally different we've
 
01:25:29.390 --> 01:25:29.400 align:start position:0%
never seen it till an hour ago and does
 
01:25:32.030 --> 01:25:32.040 align:start position:0%
not address the issues that were
 
01:25:34.510 --> 01:25:34.520 align:start position:0%
discovered and are
 
01:25:38.030 --> 01:25:38.040 align:start position:0%
occurring so part of this in so the
 
01:25:39.390 --> 01:25:39.400 align:start position:0%
reason there is a difference she is
 
01:25:41.950 --> 01:25:41.960 align:start position:0%
correct we agreed upon that language but
 
01:25:44.430 --> 01:25:44.440 align:start position:0%
it was with the but now with the charge
 
01:25:47.550 --> 01:25:47.560 align:start position:0%
of trying to reduce some of the the
 
01:25:50.189 --> 01:25:50.199 align:start position:0%
fiscal burden we remove that section
 
01:25:52.830 --> 01:25:52.840 align:start position:0%
because a we can add it to the cons the
 
01:25:55.550 --> 01:25:55.560 align:start position:0%
the form in consultation with the with
 
01:25:57.870 --> 01:25:57.880 align:start position:0%
the OCA that's in the next section but
 
01:26:00.390 --> 01:26:00.400 align:start position:0%
then also it allows for some flexibility
 
01:26:02.390 --> 01:26:02.400 align:start position:0%
to determine who we should meet with
 
01:26:06.270 --> 01:26:06.280 align:start position:0%
versus shall meet with these people we
 
01:26:09.270 --> 01:26:09.280 align:start position:0%
can we can manipul not manipulate we can
 
01:26:11.790 --> 01:26:11.800 align:start position:0%
determine and to deem who is appropriate
 
01:26:14.750 --> 01:26:14.760 align:start position:0%
to meet with also some of these
 
01:26:16.790 --> 01:26:16.800 align:start position:0%
discussions could be had over the phone
 
01:26:19.229 --> 01:26:19.239 align:start position:0%
and not in person necessarily so that's
 
01:26:20.950 --> 01:26:20.960 align:start position:0%
why we just removed it so that we could
 
01:26:24.990 --> 01:26:25.000 align:start position:0%
add it to the form to meet consultation
 
01:26:27.709 --> 01:26:27.719 align:start position:0%
with the OCA and then also as I stated
 
01:26:30.470 --> 01:26:30.480 align:start position:0%
earlier we have asked that they you know
 
01:26:32.149 --> 01:26:32.159 align:start position:0%
Shadow some of our visits so that they
 
01:26:34.310 --> 01:26:34.320 align:start position:0%
can say hey maybe you should look at
 
01:26:36.109 --> 01:26:36.119 align:start position:0%
this and look at that as well so we
 
01:26:38.310 --> 01:26:38.320 align:start position:0%
aren't trying to Sher the
 
01:26:40.070 --> 01:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
responsibilities we're trying to make
 
01:26:43.109 --> 01:26:43.119 align:start position:0%
sure our staff aren't there just okay I
 
01:26:44.669 --> 01:26:44.679 align:start position:0%
met with this person okay you know
 
01:26:45.950 --> 01:26:45.960 align:start position:0%
they're really having meaningful
 
01:26:47.590 --> 01:26:47.600 align:start position:0%
conversations and they're able to drive
 
01:26:50.870 --> 01:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
that based on what they are experiencing
 
01:26:54.510 --> 01:26:54.520 align:start position:0%
at the facility and not beholden to a
 
01:26:58.070 --> 01:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
checklist in in a statute and in all
 
01:27:02.310 --> 01:27:02.320 align:start position:0%
cander yes if this amendment is agreed
 
01:27:05.870 --> 01:27:05.880 align:start position:0%
upon the fiscal note for the travel will
 
01:27:08.189 --> 01:27:08.199 align:start position:0%
basically go down to zero I mean because
 
01:27:10.550 --> 01:27:10.560 align:start position:0%
we are doing this on a monthly basis if
 
01:27:13.109 --> 01:27:13.119 align:start position:0%
it goes from Shell to May when it comes
 
01:27:16.350 --> 01:27:16.360 align:start position:0%
to talking with the leadership and the
 
01:27:18.910 --> 01:27:18.920 align:start position:0%
providers in a way that can be done at a
 
01:27:21.430 --> 01:27:21.440 align:start position:0%
later time but within that month span
 
01:27:24.390 --> 01:27:24.400 align:start position:0%
during Zoom a zoom or a teams or by and
 
01:27:27.149 --> 01:27:27.159 align:start position:0%
correspondence then of course the social
 
01:27:30.070 --> 01:27:30.080 align:start position:0%
worker and the jppo can be doing these
 
01:27:32.229 --> 01:27:32.239 align:start position:0%
visits as as they're doing now and that
 
01:27:35.950 --> 01:27:35.960 align:start position:0%
would reduce a fiscal note
 
01:27:38.390 --> 01:27:38.400 align:start position:0%
considerably so so you just mentioned
 
01:27:41.189 --> 01:27:41.199 align:start position:0%
the word may I I'm not seeing any Ma I'm
 
01:27:43.830 --> 01:27:43.840 align:start position:0%
seeing on line 18 at the end of the the
 
01:27:46.430 --> 01:27:46.440 align:start position:0%
last word of that line 18 on page three
 
01:27:49.750 --> 01:27:49.760 align:start position:0%
is a shall I apologize and and and and I
 
01:27:51.790 --> 01:27:51.800 align:start position:0%
just want to understand your point that
 
01:27:54.709 --> 01:27:54.719 align:start position:0%
was our original yeah because that's
 
01:27:58.189 --> 01:27:58.199 align:start position:0%
still a sh correct we our
 
01:28:01.350 --> 01:28:01.360 align:start position:0%
original um our original internal
 
01:28:04.510 --> 01:28:04.520 align:start position:0%
discussions had May um but we left it as
 
01:28:07.030 --> 01:28:07.040 align:start position:0%
shall in the amendment okay could
 
01:28:09.750 --> 01:28:09.760 align:start position:0%
clarification where you say that these
 
01:28:12.950 --> 01:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
preferably in real time uh that we've
 
01:28:15.470 --> 01:28:15.480 align:start position:0%
mentioned Microsoft teams a video
 
01:28:17.950 --> 01:28:17.960 align:start position:0%
conferencing technique as would that be
 
01:28:21.270 --> 01:28:21.280 align:start position:0%
an acceptable way to conduct a real time
 
01:28:23.910 --> 01:28:23.920 align:start position:0%
discussion when you're talking to the
 
01:28:26.189 --> 01:28:26.199 align:start position:0%
the managers and leaders and case
 
01:28:28.229 --> 01:28:28.239 align:start position:0%
managers and I think that's why we
 
01:28:31.510 --> 01:28:31.520 align:start position:0%
defined it asally in real yes it's very
 
01:28:33.790 --> 01:28:33.800 align:start position:0%
broad we kept broad for a reason right
 
01:28:37.910 --> 01:28:37.920 align:start position:0%
because it' be Zoom teams any form of um
 
01:28:40.430 --> 01:28:40.440 align:start position:0%
Real Time Communication I understand
 
01:28:43.030 --> 01:28:43.040 align:start position:0%
your your testimony thank you I think
 
01:28:45.149 --> 01:28:45.159 align:start position:0%
there's a a definite middle ground that
 
01:28:47.830 --> 01:28:47.840 align:start position:0%
the division jumped right over going
 
01:28:50.669 --> 01:28:50.679 align:start position:0%
from the agreed upon amendment to this
 
01:28:52.830 --> 01:28:52.840 align:start position:0%
language exactly what you just said
 
01:28:55.270 --> 01:28:55.280 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards you you could
 
01:28:57.629 --> 01:28:57.639 align:start position:0%
give them the option of doing a teams
 
01:28:59.750 --> 01:28:59.760 align:start position:0%
but still lay out who they need to talk
 
01:29:01.990 --> 01:29:02.000 align:start position:0%
to the idea
 
01:29:04.629 --> 01:29:04.639 align:start position:0%
that we don't need to put it in statute
 
01:29:05.830 --> 01:29:05.840 align:start position:0%
because we're going to follow what the
 
01:29:08.910 --> 01:29:08.920 align:start position:0%
form says seems very disingenuous
 
01:29:11.510 --> 01:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
because they don't the form would
 
01:29:14.109 --> 01:29:14.119 align:start position:0%
essentially create the same
 
01:29:17.270 --> 01:29:17.280 align:start position:0%
checklist intent aside if you're saying
 
01:29:18.830 --> 01:29:18.840 align:start position:0%
we're going to put all that stuff into a
 
01:29:22.070 --> 01:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
checklist form that says here then why
 
01:29:24.870 --> 01:29:24.880 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be appropriate to put into
 
01:29:26.709 --> 01:29:26.719 align:start position:0%
law the types of people you need to talk
 
01:29:29.790 --> 01:29:29.800 align:start position:0%
to which still General I you know I I
 
01:29:31.750 --> 01:29:31.760 align:start position:0%
can see your concerns about the
 
01:29:33.669 --> 01:29:33.679 align:start position:0%
effectiveness and whether or not we
 
01:29:35.629 --> 01:29:35.639 align:start position:0%
execute in the way that you want to but
 
01:29:37.510 --> 01:29:37.520 align:start position:0%
I just don't want to imply that anyone's
 
01:29:40.070 --> 01:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
being disingenuous that's that's not the
 
01:29:43.310 --> 01:29:43.320 align:start position:0%
way to have these conf conversations I I
 
01:29:46.750 --> 01:29:46.760 align:start position:0%
think the the key point that has not yet
 
01:29:48.189 --> 01:29:48.199 align:start position:0%
been clear to me and that I think is
 
01:29:51.790 --> 01:29:51.800 align:start position:0%
important to discuss in this venue is
 
01:29:56.510 --> 01:29:56.520 align:start position:0%
how adding a very clear outline of what
 
01:29:59.790 --> 01:29:59.800 align:start position:0%
they what cpsws or jpos are required to
 
01:30:02.430 --> 01:30:02.440 align:start position:0%
do how that requires additional
 
01:30:04.590 --> 01:30:04.600 align:start position:0%
positions I'm not seeing that connection
 
01:30:06.590 --> 01:30:06.600 align:start position:0%
I'm not hearing that connection I am
 
01:30:08.430 --> 01:30:08.440 align:start position:0%
hearing that we're potentially making it
 
01:30:10.350 --> 01:30:10.360 align:start position:0%
easier by giving them a guide to go by
 
01:30:12.270 --> 01:30:12.280 align:start position:0%
as opposed to guessing and assuming what
 
01:30:13.950 --> 01:30:13.960 align:start position:0%
they are going to do on those visits
 
01:30:16.669 --> 01:30:16.679 align:start position:0%
that's the point I've not heard argu but
 
01:30:18.790 --> 01:30:18.800 align:start position:0%
we're not there yet I mean to me I'm
 
01:30:20.910 --> 01:30:20.920 align:start position:0%
just I'm a simple guy I'm just trying to
 
01:30:23.310 --> 01:30:23.320 align:start position:0%
go line by line to understand each of
 
01:30:26.310 --> 01:30:26.320 align:start position:0%
the major points of this because in the
 
01:30:30.950 --> 01:30:30.960 align:start position:0%
totality of this this creates a a a
 
01:30:34.470 --> 01:30:34.480 align:start position:0%
workload Benchmark that later we come
 
01:30:37.990 --> 01:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
back and we talk at later what the man
 
01:30:41.350 --> 01:30:41.360 align:start position:0%
Manpower would be needed to satisfy the
 
01:30:44.590 --> 01:30:44.600 align:start position:0%
changes in the workload these words are
 
01:30:48.070 --> 01:30:48.080 align:start position:0%
workload related not we haven't gotten
 
01:30:49.750 --> 01:30:49.760 align:start position:0%
to the point where we're allocating
 
01:30:52.189 --> 01:30:52.199 align:start position:0%
manpower to them yet well I I'm just
 
01:30:53.590 --> 01:30:53.600 align:start position:0%
this is my question because this point
 
01:30:53.600 --> 01:30:54.669 align:start position:0%
this is my question because this point
was

01:30:54.669 --> 01:30:54.679 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:30:57.109 --> 01:30:57.119 align:start position:0%
this piece this specific section was
 
01:30:59.950 --> 01:30:59.960 align:start position:0%
represented as being reduced down to be
 
01:31:02.070 --> 01:31:02.080 align:start position:0%
able to decrease the number of cpsws but
 
01:31:04.510 --> 01:31:04.520 align:start position:0%
I'm not understanding that link that
 
01:31:06.350 --> 01:31:06.360 align:start position:0%
that that piece hasn't been clarified
 
01:31:07.950 --> 01:31:07.960 align:start position:0%
for me
 
01:31:10.350 --> 01:31:10.360 align:start position:0%
yet well I mean I think we could we
 
01:31:11.910 --> 01:31:11.920 align:start position:0%
could say that if you increase someone's
 
01:31:14.270 --> 01:31:14.280 align:start position:0%
time at a facility and multiply that so
 
01:31:16.510 --> 01:31:16.520 align:start position:0%
many times that increases one's workload
 
01:31:18.709 --> 01:31:18.719 align:start position:0%
so therefore we would need additional
 
01:31:20.990 --> 01:31:21.000 align:start position:0%
staff to handle
 
01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:22.750 align:start position:0%
staff to handle
workload

01:31:22.750 --> 01:31:22.760 align:start position:0%
workload
 
01:31:25.750 --> 01:31:25.760 align:start position:0%
um but
 
01:31:29.229 --> 01:31:29.239 align:start position:0%
but excuse me but I I'm hearing both
 
01:31:31.270 --> 01:31:31.280 align:start position:0%
both sides saying that you don't need
 
01:31:35.750 --> 01:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
additional staff for this par particular
 
01:31:38.030 --> 01:31:38.040 align:start position:0%
function so when we wrote the fiscal
 
01:31:40.910 --> 01:31:40.920 align:start position:0%
note for 1573 it was as it passed the
 
01:31:43.350 --> 01:31:43.360 align:start position:0%
house floor we had to stick to that so
 
01:31:46.510 --> 01:31:46.520 align:start position:0%
that is where that episode of treatment
 
01:31:50.550 --> 01:31:50.560 align:start position:0%
that's where that that fiscal note
 
01:31:54.030 --> 01:31:54.040 align:start position:0%
ballooned as you know we did agree upon
 
01:31:55.669 --> 01:31:55.679 align:start position:0%
language to reduce that remove the
 
01:31:57.390 --> 01:31:57.400 align:start position:0%
episode of treatment language so that
 
01:31:59.950 --> 01:31:59.960 align:start position:0%
will reduce the fiscal note but we still
 
01:32:02.070 --> 01:32:02.080 align:start position:0%
because it would be an it's still if
 
01:32:04.109 --> 01:32:04.119 align:start position:0%
you're expanding the visit you're
 
01:32:05.590 --> 01:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
expanding their time there you're
 
01:32:09.070 --> 01:32:09.080 align:start position:0%
expanding that workload that will
 
01:32:11.390 --> 01:32:11.400 align:start position:0%
cause an increase in workload so
 
01:32:13.310 --> 01:32:13.320 align:start position:0%
therefore it would require an increase
 
01:32:15.790 --> 01:32:15.800 align:start position:0%
in a a nominal increase of
 
01:32:19.070 --> 01:32:19.080 align:start position:0%
staff and that's we we agree that the
 
01:32:22.270 --> 01:32:22.280 align:start position:0%
visit would be slightly longer it should
 
01:32:25.870 --> 01:32:25.880 align:start position:0%
be a DI Minimus increase inre in staff
 
01:32:28.910 --> 01:32:28.920 align:start position:0%
Maybe by some hours it should absolutely
 
01:32:31.590 --> 01:32:31.600 align:start position:0%
eliminate that travel request because
 
01:32:34.629 --> 01:32:34.639 align:start position:0%
these people are already going there and
 
01:32:36.590 --> 01:32:36.600 align:start position:0%
in addition as we talked earlier with
 
01:32:38.510 --> 01:32:38.520 align:start position:0%
where these facilities are
 
01:32:42.310 --> 01:32:42.320 align:start position:0%
located 228 inside New Hampshire so
 
01:32:44.990 --> 01:32:45.000 align:start position:0%
that's mileage you know 56 in New
 
01:32:46.550 --> 01:32:46.560 align:start position:0%
England again just mileage you're
 
01:32:49.709 --> 01:32:49.719 align:start position:0%
talking three children where there's any
 
01:32:51.990 --> 01:32:52.000 align:start position:0%
travel and again they're still already
 
01:32:54.510 --> 01:32:54.520 align:start position:0%
getting on the airplane and going there
 
01:32:59.390 --> 01:32:59.400 align:start position:0%
so that's where we are un confused about
 
01:33:01.109 --> 01:33:01.119 align:start position:0%
why would this require any additional
 
01:33:02.350 --> 01:33:02.360 align:start position:0%
travel but frankly it should be a
 
01:33:04.550 --> 01:33:04.560 align:start position:0%
dominous increase because what they're
 
01:33:07.109 --> 01:33:07.119 align:start position:0%
saying is these things already happen
 
01:33:08.830 --> 01:33:08.840 align:start position:0%
maybe it's happening over teams or
 
01:33:10.870 --> 01:33:10.880 align:start position:0%
virtually maybe that is the solution is
 
01:33:13.229 --> 01:33:13.239 align:start position:0%
build it in that way but it 22 new
 
01:33:14.709 --> 01:33:14.719 align:start position:0%
people to do visits that already
 
01:33:17.189 --> 01:33:17.199 align:start position:0%
happened that's where our confusion Lies
 
01:33:18.870 --> 01:33:18.880 align:start position:0%
We thought taking out that episode of
 
01:33:21.470 --> 01:33:21.480 align:start position:0%
treatment should completely eliminate
 
01:33:23.470 --> 01:33:23.480 align:start position:0%
the request for more bodies and there
 
01:33:25.070 --> 01:33:25.080 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have been any more travel to
 
01:33:28.149 --> 01:33:28.159 align:start position:0%
be related so so I guess I'm now getting
 
01:33:30.189 --> 01:33:30.199 align:start position:0%
confused as to the fiscal note for for
 
01:33:32.669 --> 01:33:32.679 align:start position:0%
what are we talking about because right
 
01:33:36.870 --> 01:33:36.880 align:start position:0%
now our fiscal note is based on how
 
01:33:40.350 --> 01:33:40.360 align:start position:0%
house bill 1573 passed and the way it
 
01:33:42.590 --> 01:33:42.600 align:start position:0%
passed it would require an in-person
 
01:33:45.070 --> 01:33:45.080 align:start position:0%
case worker to be doing the 30-day
 
01:33:47.430 --> 01:33:47.440 align:start position:0%
visits which they already do and to be
 
01:33:50.070 --> 01:33:50.080 align:start position:0%
in person at these treatment team
 
01:33:51.910 --> 01:33:51.920 align:start position:0%
meetings to be able to have these
 
01:33:54.550 --> 01:33:54.560 align:start position:0%
conversations required under
 
01:33:57.310 --> 01:33:57.320 align:start position:0%
1573 there are currently
 
01:34:01.750 --> 01:34:01.760 align:start position:0%
287 youth placed in residential care 93
 
01:34:04.550 --> 01:34:04.560 align:start position:0%
of those are outside of New Hampshire
 
01:34:06.709 --> 01:34:06.719 align:start position:0%
and it was the case worker assigned to
 
01:34:09.790 --> 01:34:09.800 align:start position:0%
the case was also How It Was Written in
 
01:34:11.870 --> 01:34:11.880 align:start position:0%
uh house bills
 
01:34:15.550 --> 01:34:15.560 align:start position:0%
1573 so again that's 93 outside of New
 
01:34:17.709 --> 01:34:17.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire visits which would
 
01:34:22.430 --> 01:34:22.440 align:start position:0%
be a lot longer and also possibly under
 
01:34:24.189 --> 01:34:24.199 align:start position:0%
multiple days because because of that
 
01:34:26.149 --> 01:34:26.159 align:start position:0%
treatment team meeting needing to be in
 
01:34:28.070 --> 01:34:28.080 align:start position:0%
person so if we're talking about the
 
01:34:30.629 --> 01:34:30.639 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact of this amendment yes
 
01:34:33.109 --> 01:34:33.119 align:start position:0%
there would be no fiscal impact for
 
01:34:35.990 --> 01:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
travel because the the case workers are
 
01:34:38.510 --> 01:34:38.520 align:start position:0%
already doing these 30-day visits
 
01:34:40.310 --> 01:34:40.320 align:start position:0%
however they're doing these 30-day
 
01:34:43.189 --> 01:34:43.199 align:start position:0%
visits with the ability to have the
 
01:34:46.990 --> 01:34:47.000 align:start position:0%
treatment team meetings by live teams
 
01:34:50.709 --> 01:34:50.719 align:start position:0%
Zoom or written correspondence so yes
 
01:34:52.550 --> 01:34:52.560 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note would be dramatically
 
01:34:55.390 --> 01:34:55.400 align:start position:0%
decreased for this amendment we haven't
 
01:34:57.990 --> 01:34:58.000 align:start position:0%
done the a new fiscal note just because
 
01:35:00.629 --> 01:35:00.639 align:start position:0%
how it was left uh the first day of the
 
01:35:03.510 --> 01:35:03.520 align:start position:0%
finance committee so I did ask M Mr
 
01:35:06.790 --> 01:35:06.800 align:start position:0%
Ripple to um he's going to work
 
01:35:09.149 --> 01:35:09.159 align:start position:0%
on it's not going to be a new fiscal
 
01:35:11.229 --> 01:35:11.239 align:start position:0%
note but it's going to be a so we can do
 
01:35:13.270 --> 01:35:13.280 align:start position:0%
a fiscal analysis of the proposed
 
01:35:15.229 --> 01:35:15.239 align:start position:0%
amendment I would suggest though that we
 
01:35:17.629 --> 01:35:17.639 align:start position:0%
would like to have a a final complete
 
01:35:19.950 --> 01:35:19.960 align:start position:0%
official OSS Amendment before we write
 
01:35:23.750 --> 01:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
anything on that yeah okay I guess the
 
01:35:25.510 --> 01:35:25.520 align:start position:0%
other thing I would like to at some
 
01:35:28.590 --> 01:35:28.600 align:start position:0%
point try to get a handle on
 
01:35:31.669 --> 01:35:31.679 align:start position:0%
particularly around the travel line is I
 
01:35:35.870 --> 01:35:35.880 align:start position:0%
cannot remember how much is in the
 
01:35:39.669 --> 01:35:39.679 align:start position:0%
existing budget for travel
 
01:35:42.430 --> 01:35:42.440 align:start position:0%
and I guess that would be sort of a Mr
 
01:35:45.669 --> 01:35:45.679 align:start position:0%
White question at some point not not
 
01:35:47.390 --> 01:35:47.400 align:start position:0%
right now but as we go on I would like
 
01:35:49.550 --> 01:35:49.560 align:start position:0%
to know how much is in the existing Bud
 
01:35:51.990 --> 01:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
state budget for
 
01:35:55.629 --> 01:35:55.639 align:start position:0%
travel within Madam chairman I I just
 
01:35:58.229 --> 01:35:58.239 align:start position:0%
need a clarification again because I
 
01:36:01.709 --> 01:36:01.719 align:start position:0%
heard the number of 96 people children
 
01:36:03.510 --> 01:36:03.520 align:start position:0%
being outside of New
 
01:36:08.070 --> 01:36:08.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and before I heard 56 in the
 
01:36:11.149 --> 01:36:11.159 align:start position:0%
New England area and three
 
01:36:14.510 --> 01:36:14.520 align:start position:0%
outside so where's this 96 children that
 
01:36:16.390 --> 01:36:16.400 align:start position:0%
you talk
 
01:36:22.070 --> 01:36:22.080 align:start position:0%
about so as of res as of March 8th 2024
 
01:36:25.709 --> 01:36:25.719 align:start position:0%
there are currently 200 64 youth in New
 
01:36:29.229 --> 01:36:29.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire 88 youth in the New England
 
01:36:29.239 --> 01:36:32.310 align:start position:0%
Hampshire 88 youth in the New England
area

01:36:32.310 --> 01:36:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:35.669 --> 01:36:35.679 align:start position:0%
and I I think the confus five nationally
 
01:36:40.070 --> 01:36:40.080 align:start position:0%
which is three DCF and two bcbh Susan's
 
01:36:43.910 --> 01:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
including the bcbh voluntary youth Place
 
01:36:45.910 --> 01:36:45.920 align:start position:0%
episode of treatment under this original
 
01:36:48.870 --> 01:36:48.880 align:start position:0%
amendment that was passed by the house
 
01:36:51.430 --> 01:36:51.440 align:start position:0%
correct so by striking episode of
 
01:36:54.070 --> 01:36:54.080 align:start position:0%
treatment which we've all agreed to you
 
01:36:57.390 --> 01:36:57.400 align:start position:0%
would lose all those bcbh Place youth
 
01:37:00.310 --> 01:37:00.320 align:start position:0%
when you're talking about monthly worker
 
01:37:01.830 --> 01:37:01.840 align:start position:0%
visits yes so the numbers that we
 
01:37:04.229 --> 01:37:04.239 align:start position:0%
provided to you are strictly children
 
01:37:05.629 --> 01:37:05.639 align:start position:0%
placed by the department of children
 
01:37:08.350 --> 01:37:08.360 align:start position:0%
youth and families yes yes sorry I
 
01:37:10.830 --> 01:37:10.840 align:start position:0%
apologize there are currently 176 who
 
01:37:12.910 --> 01:37:12.920 align:start position:0%
are uh placed pursuant to abuse and
 
01:37:17.550 --> 01:37:17.560 align:start position:0%
neglect a 169 C case and 93 uh youth
 
01:37:20.070 --> 01:37:20.080 align:start position:0%
place pursuant to a juvenile resident a
 
01:37:22.990 --> 01:37:23.000 align:start position:0%
juvenile case 47 chins and 46
 
01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:27.270 align:start position:0%
juvenile case 47 chins and 46
delinquents

01:37:27.270 --> 01:37:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:33.470 --> 01:37:33.480 align:start position:0%
say yes okay so um online's 18 through
 
01:37:37.709 --> 01:37:37.719 align:start position:0%
20 uh it it places an obligation on on
 
01:37:39.790 --> 01:37:39.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire state employees that we
 
01:37:43.510 --> 01:37:43.520 align:start position:0%
shall contact the following enumerated
 
01:37:47.189 --> 01:37:47.199 align:start position:0%
positions but those enumerated positions
 
01:37:49.990 --> 01:37:50.000 align:start position:0%
may not be under the authority of the
 
01:37:54.070 --> 01:37:54.080 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire and and expecting
 
01:37:57.750 --> 01:37:57.760 align:start position:0%
us to do something that our other party
 
01:37:59.790 --> 01:37:59.800 align:start position:0%
may not have time for they're on
 
01:38:01.790 --> 01:38:01.800 align:start position:0%
vacation they're sick they're in
 
01:38:04.189 --> 01:38:04.199 align:start position:0%
transition I I'm a little uncomfortable
 
01:38:07.270 --> 01:38:07.280 align:start position:0%
with the use of sha in that instance
 
01:38:09.830 --> 01:38:09.840 align:start position:0%
because we don't have the authority to
 
01:38:13.310 --> 01:38:13.320 align:start position:0%
compel their participation and so I I
 
01:38:15.430 --> 01:38:15.440 align:start position:0%
think I'm comfortable with directing our
 
01:38:19.229 --> 01:38:19.239 align:start position:0%
state employees to to attempt to meet
 
01:38:22.589 --> 01:38:22.599 align:start position:0%
with all of them and but I don't know
 
01:38:26.910 --> 01:38:26.920 align:start position:0%
that saying they shall is uh appropriate
 
01:38:28.870 --> 01:38:28.880 align:start position:0%
they are required to present this
 
01:38:30.589 --> 01:38:30.599 align:start position:0%
information for court reports they are
 
01:38:32.589 --> 01:38:32.599 align:start position:0%
required under federal law to check in
 
01:38:34.589 --> 01:38:34.599 align:start position:0%
with these providers that are providing
 
01:38:37.189 --> 01:38:37.199 align:start position:0%
treatment to Children these are also
 
01:38:38.950 --> 01:38:38.960 align:start position:0%
paid providers to provide this treatment
 
01:38:40.229 --> 01:38:40.239 align:start position:0%
for children so they are required to
 
01:38:42.870 --> 01:38:42.880 align:start position:0%
talk with those who are the custodian of
 
01:38:44.910 --> 01:38:44.920 align:start position:0%
that child um so this is already a
 
01:38:46.830 --> 01:38:46.840 align:start position:0%
requirement that we should be aligning
 
01:38:48.870 --> 01:38:48.880 align:start position:0%
with ensuring that our statute aligns
 
01:38:51.350 --> 01:38:51.360 align:start position:0%
with the federal statutes and not
 
01:38:53.709 --> 01:38:53.719 align:start position:0%
limiting or reducing that in any why we
 
01:38:55.350 --> 01:38:55.360 align:start position:0%
include a written correspondence because
 
01:38:57.030 --> 01:38:57.040 align:start position:0%
ferally it's written correspondence
 
01:38:59.350 --> 01:38:59.360 align:start position:0%
they're required to do under the federal
 
01:39:01.950 --> 01:39:01.960 align:start position:0%
law order that's why we Sorry Court to
 
01:39:04.030 --> 01:39:04.040 align:start position:0%
make a reasonable efforts finding to get
 
01:39:07.390 --> 01:39:07.400 align:start position:0%
title 4E funding they have they have to
 
01:39:09.109 --> 01:39:09.119 align:start position:0%
so so I guess I would have Rewritten the
 
01:39:11.750 --> 01:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
federal law then because you can't you
 
01:39:14.350 --> 01:39:14.360 align:start position:0%
you can't order somebody to do something
 
01:39:15.790 --> 01:39:15.800 align:start position:0%
when they don't work for you and you
 
01:39:18.350 --> 01:39:18.360 align:start position:0%
can't fire them I I mean this is just
 
01:39:21.629 --> 01:39:21.639 align:start position:0%
not practical in the but but I can
 
01:39:24.149 --> 01:39:24.159 align:start position:0%
understand it's federal law so I won't
 
01:39:25.950 --> 01:39:25.960 align:start position:0%
assume that it makes sense and if you
 
01:39:27.550 --> 01:39:27.560 align:start position:0%
want to change it you need to run for a
 
01:39:27.560 --> 01:39:29.229 align:start position:0%
want to change it you need to run for a
different

01:39:29.229 --> 01:39:29.239 align:start position:0%
different
 
01:39:31.910 --> 01:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
office and they are contracted providers
 
01:39:33.910 --> 01:39:33.920 align:start position:0%
when we place a child as you said at the
 
01:39:36.149 --> 01:39:36.159 align:start position:0%
hearing last week like we are paying
 
01:39:37.629 --> 01:39:37.639 align:start position:0%
them there is an agreement whether it's
 
01:39:40.109 --> 01:39:40.119 align:start position:0%
an actual contract or the certification
 
01:39:43.510 --> 01:39:43.520 align:start position:0%
so they they are required to answer if
 
01:39:45.070 --> 01:39:45.080 align:start position:0%
they don't I you know you're right we
 
01:39:52.310 --> 01:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:52.320 --> 01:39:57.270 align:start position:0%
 
power

01:39:57.270 --> 01:39:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:59.910 --> 01:39:59.920 align:start position:0%
so this is where I am actually going to
 
01:40:02.430 --> 01:40:02.440 align:start position:0%
pass it off to the OCA because I have
 
01:40:05.629 --> 01:40:05.639 align:start position:0%
not had much to do with the court piece
 
01:40:08.669 --> 01:40:08.679 align:start position:0%
um however is there any issue with 21
 
01:40:11.109 --> 01:40:11.119 align:start position:0%
through 23 I don't I I think I think
 
01:40:13.790 --> 01:40:13.800 align:start position:0%
you're dismounting just a moment too
 
01:40:16.270 --> 01:40:16.280 align:start position:0%
early that's just the form oh that's the
 
01:40:19.229 --> 01:40:19.239 align:start position:0%
form that we agreed on basically stating
 
01:40:21.109 --> 01:40:21.119 align:start position:0%
that we will create a form and a
 
01:40:23.470 --> 01:40:23.480 align:start position:0%
standard operating procedure uh in in
 
01:40:25.589 --> 01:40:25.599 align:start position:0%
consultation with the OCA as to the
 
01:40:28.790 --> 01:40:28.800 align:start position:0%
monthly child visits as it pertains to
 
01:40:31.229 --> 01:40:31.239 align:start position:0%
the previous paragraph and it was just
 
01:40:33.390 --> 01:40:33.400 align:start position:0%
clarifying some language taking out Lang
 
01:40:35.030 --> 01:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
language that wasn't necessary to be in
 
01:40:37.629 --> 01:40:37.639 align:start position:0%
there so that was a great fund by
 
01:40:40.189 --> 01:40:40.199 align:start position:0%
yep now on to page four of the
 
01:40:43.030 --> 01:40:43.040 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet yeah this is the court
 
01:40:45.390 --> 01:40:45.400 align:start position:0%
oversight piece that's when the court um
 
01:40:48.950 --> 01:40:48.960 align:start position:0%
and Aeron had to step over to division
 
01:40:50.550 --> 01:40:50.560 align:start position:0%
one because she has a bill that she
 
01:40:54.589 --> 01:40:54.599 align:start position:0%
needs to speak to them about okay um so
 
01:40:57.790 --> 01:40:57.800 align:start position:0%
can we move to a a different section
 
01:41:00.830 --> 01:41:00.840 align:start position:0%
that doesn't involve the court we can go
 
01:41:02.910 --> 01:41:02.920 align:start position:0%
on to the last section which is the
 
01:41:06.629 --> 01:41:06.639 align:start position:0%
report uh page six of your spreadsheet
 
01:41:09.990 --> 01:41:10.000 align:start position:0%
which is I believe
 
01:41:13.470 --> 01:41:13.480 align:start position:0%
also the bottom of page five of your
 
01:41:15.910 --> 01:41:15.920 align:start position:0%
Amendment starting on line
 
01:41:19.310 --> 01:41:19.320 align:start position:0%
31 and that was the the department would
 
01:41:21.750 --> 01:41:21.760 align:start position:0%
like to to show good faith effort
 
01:41:24.270 --> 01:41:24.280 align:start position:0%
everything of that nature to to off to
 
01:41:27.629 --> 01:41:27.639 align:start position:0%
issue a an annual report as to how we're
 
01:41:29.750 --> 01:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
doing with this bill and so we would
 
01:41:31.550 --> 01:41:31.560 align:start position:0%
like to provide that to the policy
 
01:41:33.750 --> 01:41:33.760 align:start position:0%
committees that passed this legislation
 
01:41:35.510 --> 01:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
as well as the children's oversight
 
01:41:38.990 --> 01:41:39.000 align:start position:0%
committee um the the change is we had
 
01:41:41.229 --> 01:41:41.239 align:start position:0%
just thrown it in there so we put in
 
01:41:43.270 --> 01:41:43.280 align:start position:0%
consultation with the OCA because we
 
01:41:45.149 --> 01:41:45.159 align:start position:0%
thought it could be a joint effort but
 
01:41:46.750 --> 01:41:46.760 align:start position:0%
because of our our
 
01:41:50.709 --> 01:41:50.719 align:start position:0%
natural siloed roles um they didn't feel
 
01:41:52.470 --> 01:41:52.480 align:start position:0%
it was appropriate for them to be added
 
01:41:54.070 --> 01:41:54.080 align:start position:0%
that's fine we we just removed their
 
01:41:58.589 --> 01:41:58.599 align:start position:0%
names from it that's all yes so so two
 
01:42:00.669 --> 01:42:00.679 align:start position:0%
questions here
 
01:42:05.030 --> 01:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
um is there any uh uh concern about this
 
01:42:07.870 --> 01:42:07.880 align:start position:0%
report being uh stripped of any uh
 
01:42:10.550 --> 01:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
personal information that we we're we're
 
01:42:12.189 --> 01:42:12.199 align:start position:0%
doing we're writing this report
 
01:42:15.109 --> 01:42:15.119 align:start position:0%
consistent with privacy expectations
 
01:42:17.189 --> 01:42:17.199 align:start position:0%
absolutely our our department does not
 
01:42:19.629 --> 01:42:19.639 align:start position:0%
issued second second question uh in the
 
01:42:21.870 --> 01:42:21.880 align:start position:0%
list of those that you would distribute
 
01:42:23.830 --> 01:42:23.840 align:start position:0%
to um
 
01:42:26.589 --> 01:42:26.599 align:start position:0%
was consideration made to providing a
 
01:42:30.750 --> 01:42:30.760 align:start position:0%
copy to the uh joint oversight Committee
 
01:42:33.189 --> 01:42:33.199 align:start position:0%
of Health and Human Services uh we have
 
01:42:36.470 --> 01:42:36.480 align:start position:0%
a chairman here from that committee who
 
01:42:38.910 --> 01:42:38.920 align:start position:0%
who might have an opinion but this this
 
01:42:41.550 --> 01:42:41.560 align:start position:0%
feels to me from watching you that you
 
01:42:43.589 --> 01:42:43.599 align:start position:0%
would like a copy of this report as well
 
01:42:45.229 --> 01:42:45.239 align:start position:0%
he's actually also chair of the children
 
01:42:47.910 --> 01:42:47.920 align:start position:0%
and family law which is committee which
 
01:42:49.430 --> 01:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
is the one that passed this bill and
 
01:42:52.870 --> 01:42:52.880 align:start position:0%
that's why that that was so they didn't
 
01:42:54.060 --> 01:42:54.070 align:start position:0%
think us is what you're
 
01:42:54.070 --> 01:42:56.950 align:start position:0%
think us is what you're
[Laughter]

01:42:56.950 --> 01:42:56.960 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:42:59.750 --> 01:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
saying correct right we we can add you
 
01:43:01.910 --> 01:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
if you would if you would like it's not
 
01:43:03.709 --> 01:43:03.719 align:start position:0%
just me but I think in the future we
 
01:43:06.109 --> 01:43:06.119 align:start position:0%
want the the I what's the official name
 
01:43:15.310 --> 01:43:15.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:18.070 --> 01:43:18.080 align:start position:0%
services I would also know the OA should
 
01:43:19.629 --> 01:43:19.639 align:start position:0%
probably be added to that list too we
 
01:43:22.030 --> 01:43:22.040 align:start position:0%
got taken out of nope we're not no I
 
01:43:24.070 --> 01:43:24.080 align:start position:0%
think because I think we thought we were
 
01:43:25.310 --> 01:43:25.320 align:start position:0%
working with you obviously you would
 
01:43:27.750 --> 01:43:27.760 align:start position:0%
have a copy yes
 
01:43:30.669 --> 01:43:30.679 align:start position:0%
okay the OCA
 
01:43:34.910 --> 01:43:34.920 align:start position:0%
and services oversight committee okay
 
01:43:38.070 --> 01:43:38.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:40.149 --> 01:43:40.159 align:start position:0%
title so that's
 
01:43:42.790 --> 01:43:42.800 align:start position:0%
it okay that's it well that's well we
 
01:43:45.030 --> 01:43:45.040 align:start position:0%
have the court oversight piece as well
 
01:43:46.750 --> 01:43:46.760 align:start position:0%
yes and I think we're just going to have
 
01:43:51.390 --> 01:43:51.400 align:start position:0%
to wait until Aaron comes back um her to
 
01:43:54.430 --> 01:43:54.440 align:start position:0%
go through it with us okay so maybe
 
01:43:57.510 --> 01:43:57.520 align:start position:0%
we'll go on a a little break break so so
 
01:43:59.149 --> 01:43:59.159 align:start position:0%
do you want to talk to them about the
 
01:44:00.750 --> 01:44:00.760 align:start position:0%
timeline that we're on what we're trying
 
01:44:00.760 --> 01:44:01.790 align:start position:0%
timeline that we're on what we're trying
to

01:44:01.790 --> 01:44:01.800 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:44:06.510 --> 01:44:06.520 align:start position:0%
do yeah um Monday I think it's Monday
 
01:44:09.149 --> 01:44:09.159 align:start position:0%
we're have we are meeting in full
 
01:44:13.550 --> 01:44:13.560 align:start position:0%
division yep and at that point are we I
 
01:44:15.390 --> 01:44:15.400 align:start position:0%
division three has a work session on
 
01:44:17.950 --> 01:44:17.960 align:start position:0%
Monday afternoon yes okay right in our
 
01:44:20.830 --> 01:44:20.840 align:start position:0%
full division right yeah and Friday and
 
01:44:23.830 --> 01:44:23.840 align:start position:0%
then again we'll be voting on Friday
 
01:44:26.430 --> 01:44:26.440 align:start position:0%
okay will actually be and on Monday
 
01:44:28.669 --> 01:44:28.679 align:start position:0%
we're going to come up with the we'll
 
01:44:30.790 --> 01:44:30.800 align:start position:0%
bring forth an amendment to yeah mon
 
01:44:33.629 --> 01:44:33.639 align:start position:0%
Monday Monday is the last day to have
 
01:44:36.750 --> 01:44:36.760 align:start position:0%
moving Parts you know uh if we if we're
 
01:44:38.669 --> 01:44:38.679 align:start position:0%
still yet another amendment there's a
 
01:44:41.189 --> 01:44:41.199 align:start position:0%
little bit of time but it can't be so
 
01:44:43.109 --> 01:44:43.119 align:start position:0%
significant because we have to vote on
 
01:44:46.030 --> 01:44:46.040 align:start position:0%
Friday of next week right right so we're
 
01:44:48.070 --> 01:44:48.080 align:start position:0%
I think we're working really hard at
 
01:44:49.910 --> 01:44:49.920 align:start position:0%
figuring out how to say yes to each
 
01:44:53.629 --> 01:44:53.639 align:start position:0%
other here so okay
 
01:44:55.870 --> 01:44:55.880 align:start position:0%
it would probably be helpful
 
01:44:58.669 --> 01:44:58.679 align:start position:0%
if you know if there are places that the
 
01:45:00.870 --> 01:45:00.880 align:start position:0%
department and the off the child
 
01:45:04.669 --> 01:45:04.679 align:start position:0%
Advocates office could work together to
 
01:45:07.709 --> 01:45:07.719 align:start position:0%
see you know if we can come to some
 
01:45:09.390 --> 01:45:09.400 align:start position:0%
agreement about some of these pieces
 
01:45:11.310 --> 01:45:11.320 align:start position:0%
that there seems to be a lot of
 
01:45:14.390 --> 01:45:14.400 align:start position:0%
controversy about and try to try to work
 
01:45:18.270 --> 01:45:18.280 align:start position:0%
through some of those and um so that we
 
01:45:20.229 --> 01:45:20.239 align:start position:0%
can be ready for so we can be ready for
 
01:45:22.070 --> 01:45:22.080 align:start position:0%
Monday have something for Monday right
 
01:45:25.350 --> 01:45:25.360 align:start position:0%
Monday and we're done once we have that
 
01:45:27.790 --> 01:45:27.800 align:start position:0%
Kevin can start to do his fiscal
 
01:45:30.390 --> 01:45:30.400 align:start position:0%
analysis for us and that will be that
 
01:45:33.629 --> 01:45:33.639 align:start position:0%
will be really helpful to get that done
 
01:45:35.070 --> 01:45:35.080 align:start position:0%
because we're going to need that in
 
01:45:38.589 --> 01:45:38.599 align:start position:0%
order to talk to the um the rest of the
 
01:45:42.229 --> 01:45:42.239 align:start position:0%
division about the bill and the
 
01:45:46.669 --> 01:45:46.679 align:start position:0%
cost okay great do you have more
 
01:45:49.870 --> 01:45:49.880 align:start position:0%
questions I don't think so okay we're
 
01:45:51.910 --> 01:45:51.920 align:start position:0%
good thank you good thank
 
01:45:51.920 --> 01:45:55.830 align:start position:0%

we're in recess for a few minutes and I
 
01:46:00.109 --> 01:46:00.119 align:start position:0%
I'll go see if I can I think maybe Kevin
 
01:46:02.229 --> 01:46:02.239 align:start position:0%
stepped over to see how much longer um
 
01:46:04.870 --> 01:46:04.880 align:start position:0%
aon's going to be I could use a
 
01:46:07.750 --> 01:46:07.760 align:start position:0%
moment yeah I I imagine you will be
 
01:46:07.760 --> 01:46:21.910 align:start position:0%
moment yeah I I imagine you will be

some going to call us back to order on
 
01:58:03.350 --> 01:58:03.360 align:start position:0%
the sustainability issue whether it it's
 
01:58:05.790 --> 01:58:05.800 align:start position:0%
and I and I think that's very important
 
01:58:08.270 --> 01:58:08.280 align:start position:0%
seems like a sidebar conversation it is
 
01:58:10.310 --> 01:58:10.320 align:start position:0%
okay it is totally
 
01:58:14.270 --> 01:58:14.280 align:start position:0%
sidebar good okay back to the judicial
 
01:58:16.030 --> 01:58:16.040 align:start position:0%
yeah when we get
 
01:58:20.990 --> 01:58:21.000 align:start position:0%
Eric um so eror and Creed from the uh
 
01:58:23.990 --> 01:58:24.000 align:start position:0%
from the I
 
01:58:27.950 --> 01:58:27.960 align:start position:0%
here and can help us go through those
 
01:58:30.270 --> 01:58:30.280 align:start position:0%
sections and this is the first time
 
01:58:36.830 --> 01:58:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:39.910 --> 01:58:39.920 align:start position:0%
um yes please yes that would be great
 
01:58:42.910 --> 01:58:42.920 align:start position:0%
and then um I'm really looking for their
 
01:58:47.229 --> 01:58:47.239 align:start position:0%
response you know sure what's um sorry
 
01:58:52.910 --> 01:58:52.920 align:start position:0%
so this section of the bill is sub L the
 
01:58:56.750 --> 01:58:56.760 align:start position:0%
same as what passed the house last month
 
01:58:59.350 --> 01:58:59.360 align:start position:0%
the changes are in some tweaks of
 
01:59:02.589 --> 01:59:02.599 align:start position:0%
wording we worked closely um with the
 
01:59:05.589 --> 01:59:05.599 align:start position:0%
juvenile reform policy Group which is
 
01:59:07.669 --> 01:59:07.679 align:start position:0%
made up of a number of community
 
01:59:10.149 --> 01:59:10.159 align:start position:0%
advocacy groups including folks that
 
01:59:12.189 --> 01:59:12.199 align:start position:0%
represent children in these cases so New
 
01:59:14.589 --> 01:59:14.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire legal assistance uh children's
 
01:59:16.390 --> 01:59:16.400 align:start position:0%
Law Center
 
01:59:19.870 --> 01:59:19.880 align:start position:0%
DRC so most of the changes
 
01:59:23.510 --> 01:59:23.520 align:start position:0%
between representative Pearson
 
01:59:26.189 --> 01:59:26.199 align:start position:0%
um that's not the right
 
01:59:30.629 --> 01:59:30.639 align:start position:0%
one amendment that pass the house
 
01:59:33.709 --> 01:59:33.719 align:start position:0%
0427 to this amendment proposed
 
01:59:38.310 --> 01:59:38.320 align:start position:0%
amendment is weaks in language as far as
 
01:59:40.310 --> 01:59:40.320 align:start position:0%
aligning with the federal
 
01:59:44.350 --> 01:59:44.360 align:start position:0%
standards so it would be language like
 
01:59:46.550 --> 01:59:46.560 align:start position:0%
instead of saying appropriate placement
 
01:59:48.870 --> 01:59:48.880 align:start position:0%
the federal guidelines require it to be
 
01:59:51.030 --> 01:59:51.040 align:start position:0%
the most effective and appropriate level
 
01:59:52.709 --> 01:59:52.719 align:start position:0%
of care for the child in the least
 
01:59:54.550 --> 01:59:54.560 align:start position:0%
restrictive environment so it
 
01:59:56.709 --> 01:59:56.719 align:start position:0%
essentially means the same thing they
 
01:59:58.830 --> 01:59:58.840 align:start position:0%
just wanted the words to be the same as
 
02:00:02.109 --> 02:00:02.119 align:start position:0%
what is required under federal statute
 
02:00:06.109 --> 02:00:06.119 align:start position:0%
so that's what the changes are
 
02:00:08.550 --> 02:00:08.560 align:start position:0%
substantively um the reason for this
 
02:00:10.229 --> 02:00:10.239 align:start position:0%
portion of the bill and I think I
 
02:00:13.709 --> 02:00:13.719 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier this uh section also
 
02:00:16.149 --> 02:00:16.159 align:start position:0%
passed attached to s417 yesterday in
 
02:00:18.950 --> 02:00:18.960 align:start position:0%
Senate Judiciary because that bill also
 
02:00:20.589 --> 02:00:20.599 align:start position:0%
talks about residential
 
02:00:23.470 --> 02:00:23.480 align:start position:0%
placement if the goal is to reduce the
 
02:00:25.430 --> 02:00:25.440 align:start position:0%
number of children in residential
 
02:00:27.189 --> 02:00:27.199 align:start position:0%
placement and to make sure that that
 
02:00:29.550 --> 02:00:29.560 align:start position:0%
residential placement is tailored to the
 
02:00:32.109 --> 02:00:32.119 align:start position:0%
needs of that specific child for
 
02:00:35.870 --> 02:00:35.880 align:start position:0%
shortterm needs-based care the judicial
 
02:00:38.310 --> 02:00:38.320 align:start position:0%
oversight was a big part of it of well
 
02:00:40.030 --> 02:00:40.040 align:start position:0%
who who orders that placement it's the
 
02:00:41.510 --> 02:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
court who's going to order that kid out
 
02:00:44.030 --> 02:00:44.040 align:start position:0%
of placement it's the court we had also
 
02:00:47.149 --> 02:00:47.159 align:start position:0%
gotten some feedback from judges in the
 
02:00:50.550 --> 02:00:50.560 align:start position:0%
Judiciary after bledo that there was a
 
02:00:52.510 --> 02:00:52.520 align:start position:0%
feeling that they didn't
 
02:00:55.069 --> 02:00:55.079 align:start position:0%
really know that much about residential
 
02:00:56.910 --> 02:00:56.920 align:start position:0%
placements particularly the ones further
 
02:00:58.069 --> 02:00:58.079 align:start position:0%
away the ones that they weren't
 
02:01:00.589 --> 02:01:00.599 align:start position:0%
frequently placing at they were only
 
02:01:04.030 --> 02:01:04.040 align:start position:0%
getting the information presented by the
 
02:01:07.510 --> 02:01:07.520 align:start position:0%
the division and it it wasn't as
 
02:01:09.510 --> 02:01:09.520 align:start position:0%
thorough as they would like as far as
 
02:01:11.870 --> 02:01:11.880 align:start position:0%
you know the level of assessment really
 
02:01:14.470 --> 02:01:14.480 align:start position:0%
um having the terminology required by
 
02:01:16.709 --> 02:01:16.719 align:start position:0%
federal law as far as when you can place
 
02:01:18.910 --> 02:01:18.920 align:start position:0%
a child in as we talked about that most
 
02:01:21.430 --> 02:01:21.440 align:start position:0%
restrictive setting so this just sort of
 
02:01:25.189 --> 02:01:25.199 align:start position:0%
sets up the layers of evaluation and the
 
02:01:27.149 --> 02:01:27.159 align:start position:0%
information that the court needs to make
 
02:01:29.149 --> 02:01:29.159 align:start position:0%
that decision and again from a liability
 
02:01:30.550 --> 02:01:30.560 align:start position:0%
point of view if a Court's making an
 
02:01:32.589 --> 02:01:32.599 align:start position:0%
order we want to make sure that on the
 
02:01:35.750 --> 02:01:35.760 align:start position:0%
record is substantial information of why
 
02:01:37.870 --> 02:01:37.880 align:start position:0%
that order placing a child in a very
 
02:01:40.310 --> 02:01:40.320 align:start position:0%
restrictive placement is necessary so
 
02:01:43.229 --> 02:01:43.239 align:start position:0%
this is sort of split into before the
 
02:01:46.350 --> 02:01:46.360 align:start position:0%
kid gets placed now why while the kid's
 
02:01:48.390 --> 02:01:48.400 align:start position:0%
placed and how we're getting the kid out
 
02:01:52.910 --> 02:01:52.920 align:start position:0%
of placement one other um tweak we did
 
02:01:54.950 --> 02:01:54.960 align:start position:0%
make after talking with Ain was just
 
02:01:57.109 --> 02:01:57.119 align:start position:0%
sort of allowing an emergency escape
 
02:01:58.669 --> 02:01:58.679 align:start position:0%
Clause like you asked about earlier what
 
02:02:00.550 --> 02:02:00.560 align:start position:0%
if this kid needs to go into emergency
 
02:02:02.750 --> 02:02:02.760 align:start position:0%
placement allows the court a little bit
 
02:02:04.030 --> 02:02:04.040 align:start position:0%
of time to be able to get the
 
02:02:05.669 --> 02:02:05.679 align:start position:0%
information after the fact if the
 
02:02:07.390 --> 02:02:07.400 align:start position:0%
Department's making an emergency
 
02:02:09.510 --> 02:02:09.520 align:start position:0%
placement more in the Juvenile Justice
 
02:02:11.109 --> 02:02:11.119 align:start position:0%
Arena because those placements literally
 
02:02:12.470 --> 02:02:12.480 align:start position:0%
can happen in the middle of the night
 
02:02:14.069 --> 02:02:14.079 align:start position:0%
and they call a court in the middle of
 
02:02:17.830 --> 02:02:17.840 align:start position:0%
the night or judge so the first section
 
02:02:19.790 --> 02:02:19.800 align:start position:0%
is prior to placing unless it's an
 
02:02:22.790 --> 02:02:22.800 align:start position:0%
emergency the types of assessment ments
 
02:02:25.709 --> 02:02:25.719 align:start position:0%
and the findings um being that the
 
02:02:28.189 --> 02:02:28.199 align:start position:0%
child's needs cannot be met in a homik
 
02:02:31.750 --> 02:02:31.760 align:start position:0%
setting and then what they are required
 
02:02:34.189 --> 02:02:34.199 align:start position:0%
uh to meet this amendment also requires
 
02:02:35.750 --> 02:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
a little bit of language around what the
 
02:02:37.270 --> 02:02:37.280 align:start position:0%
school districts need to be doing
 
02:02:39.510 --> 02:02:39.520 align:start position:0%
because there is both state and federal
 
02:02:41.790 --> 02:02:41.800 align:start position:0%
law about the school districts still
 
02:02:44.390 --> 02:02:44.400 align:start position:0%
need to be requiring um education for
 
02:02:46.069 --> 02:02:46.079 align:start position:0%
these children in residential placements
 
02:02:48.870 --> 02:02:48.880 align:start position:0%
particularly in that special ed Arena so
 
02:02:50.830 --> 02:02:50.840 align:start position:0%
um that's the differences between the
 
02:02:52.589 --> 02:02:52.599 align:start position:0%
two was just sort of TW tweaking some of
 
02:02:55.750 --> 02:02:55.760 align:start position:0%
that language overarching though is this
 
02:02:58.910 --> 02:02:58.920 align:start position:0%
desire to get children a make sure
 
02:03:01.709 --> 02:03:01.719 align:start position:0%
they're in the right placement first and
 
02:03:03.830 --> 02:03:03.840 align:start position:0%
then get them out of that placement as
 
02:03:05.510 --> 02:03:05.520 align:start position:0%
quickly as possible when it's
 
02:03:08.790 --> 02:03:08.800 align:start position:0%
appropriate so I think um the fiscal
 
02:03:10.350 --> 02:03:10.360 align:start position:0%
note relates to the The increased
 
02:03:12.350 --> 02:03:12.360 align:start position:0%
hearing So currently children in
 
02:03:14.830 --> 02:03:14.840 align:start position:0%
placement get hearings every 90 days
 
02:03:18.510 --> 02:03:18.520 align:start position:0%
under 169 CBD those are regular review
 
02:03:21.069 --> 02:03:21.079 align:start position:0%
hearings so under this provision a child
 
02:03:22.109 --> 02:03:22.119 align:start position:0%
that goes into res presidential
 
02:03:25.350 --> 02:03:25.360 align:start position:0%
placement would get hearings every 60
 
02:03:30.229 --> 02:03:30.239 align:start position:0%
days unless the very specific um
 
02:03:32.750 --> 02:03:32.760 align:start position:0%
circumstance where the child or the
 
02:03:35.189 --> 02:03:35.199 align:start position:0%
child's representative doesn't support
 
02:03:37.069 --> 02:03:37.079 align:start position:0%
the residential treatment program level
 
02:03:40.629 --> 02:03:40.639 align:start position:0%
of care or the guardian at lium which is
 
02:03:42.629 --> 02:03:42.639 align:start position:0%
currently in law objects to that
 
02:03:45.790 --> 02:03:45.800 align:start position:0%
placement um then it would be 30 days
 
02:03:48.109 --> 02:03:48.119 align:start position:0%
and again the hope is these more
 
02:03:49.510 --> 02:03:49.520 align:start position:0%
frequent reviews lead to the child
 
02:03:51.310 --> 02:03:51.320 align:start position:0%
coming out of residential placement
 
02:03:51.320 --> 02:03:52.310 align:start position:0%
coming out of residential placement
quicker

02:03:52.310 --> 02:03:52.320 align:start position:0%
quicker
 
02:03:53.830 --> 02:03:53.840 align:start position:0%
as soon as they're out of residential
 
02:03:55.990 --> 02:03:56.000 align:start position:0%
placement it goes back to the 90day
 
02:04:00.830 --> 02:04:00.840 align:start position:0%
review this so this only applies to this
 
02:04:03.790 --> 02:04:03.800 align:start position:0%
287 kids we have been talking about that
 
02:04:08.109 --> 02:04:08.119 align:start position:0%
are placed by dcyf under 169 BC or D
 
02:04:09.910 --> 02:04:09.920 align:start position:0%
into a residential placement so out of
 
02:04:13.750 --> 02:04:13.760 align:start position:0%
the 1300 kids in care dcyf care only 287
 
02:04:15.549 --> 02:04:15.559 align:start position:0%
of them is who this would apply to and
 
02:04:17.030 --> 02:04:17.040 align:start position:0%
only for that limited period that
 
02:04:20.709 --> 02:04:20.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:20.719 --> 02:04:24.709 align:start position:0%
 
placement

02:04:24.709 --> 02:04:24.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:26.629 --> 02:04:26.639 align:start position:0%
hello my name is Aaron krian I'm the
 
02:04:29.030 --> 02:04:29.040 align:start position:0%
general counsel for the judicial branch
 
02:04:32.270 --> 02:04:32.280 align:start position:0%
say say your last name again crean c r e
 
02:04:33.870 --> 02:04:33.880 align:start position:0%
e g
 
02:04:36.069 --> 02:04:36.079 align:start position:0%
n I've sometimes heard it said it's
 
02:04:39.549 --> 02:04:39.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:42.750 --> 02:04:42.760 align:start position:0%
speaking there I looked in a nam's book
 
02:04:44.430 --> 02:04:44.440 align:start position:0%
and it said it comes from the word in
 
02:04:47.709 --> 02:04:47.719 align:start position:0%
Irish for horse from over speaking uh so
 
02:04:49.149 --> 02:04:49.159 align:start position:0%
I don't know what that says so are you
 
02:04:52.270 --> 02:04:52.280 align:start position:0%
an attorney I am an attorney
 
02:04:54.069 --> 02:04:54.079 align:start position:0%
so I I don't know it must have been bad
 
02:04:57.229 --> 02:04:57.239 align:start position:0%
for that to end up being our name um but
 
02:04:58.229 --> 02:04:58.239 align:start position:0%
there were other interpretation there
 
02:04:59.030 --> 02:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
were other
 
02:05:01.750 --> 02:05:01.760 align:start position:0%
translations uh so I I thank you for the
 
02:05:04.030 --> 02:05:04.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak on this I I know I
 
02:05:05.350 --> 02:05:05.360 align:start position:0%
don't appear before you as much in
 
02:05:07.069 --> 02:05:07.079 align:start position:0%
division three and so uh if you'll
 
02:05:09.270 --> 02:05:09.280 align:start position:0%
forgive me I I often point out and I I
 
02:05:10.629 --> 02:05:10.639 align:start position:0%
haven't spoken with folks as much that
 
02:05:12.430 --> 02:05:12.440 align:start position:0%
the courts uh generally don't take
 
02:05:14.629 --> 02:05:14.639 align:start position:0%
policy positions on bills we do point
 
02:05:16.350 --> 02:05:16.360 align:start position:0%
out Court Administration or enforcement
 
02:05:18.069 --> 02:05:18.079 align:start position:0%
issues but there are a lot of different
 
02:05:20.270 --> 02:05:20.280 align:start position:0%
ways to solve this policy issue to
 
02:05:23.030 --> 02:05:23.040 align:start position:0%
address it and we usually would not say
 
02:05:24.350 --> 02:05:24.360 align:start position:0%
do this or do that because that's the
 
02:05:26.189 --> 02:05:26.199 align:start position:0%
role of the legislature you're hearing
 
02:05:27.990 --> 02:05:28.000 align:start position:0%
from a lot of the interested parties and
 
02:05:29.270 --> 02:05:29.280 align:start position:0%
we're happy to provide technical
 
02:05:31.709 --> 02:05:31.719 align:start position:0%
feedback but um we don't defend or
 
02:05:33.910 --> 02:05:33.920 align:start position:0%
oppose different bills we just bring
 
02:05:35.430 --> 02:05:35.440 align:start position:0%
whatever you find useful to your
 
02:05:37.750 --> 02:05:37.760 align:start position:0%
evaluation and and then you tell us uh
 
02:05:39.830 --> 02:05:39.840 align:start position:0%
how you would like us to handle these
 
02:05:42.189 --> 02:05:42.199 align:start position:0%
cases uh so the the fiscal note that we
 
02:05:45.990 --> 02:05:46.000 align:start position:0%
submitted was based on uh the about 300
 
02:05:47.870 --> 02:05:47.880 align:start position:0%
number of residential placements which
 
02:05:50.030 --> 02:05:50.040 align:start position:0%
Osa is referring to I think it was 297
 
02:05:52.030 --> 02:05:52.040 align:start position:0%
in their last report so uh you know
 
02:05:54.910 --> 02:05:54.920 align:start position:0%
rounded to 300 that if that moves from
 
02:05:57.030 --> 02:05:57.040 align:start position:0%
90 days to 30 days instead of having
 
02:05:58.950 --> 02:05:58.960 align:start position:0%
1,200 hearings a year you would have
 
02:06:02.510 --> 02:06:02.520 align:start position:0%
3600 hearings a year um I understand
 
02:06:05.229 --> 02:06:05.239 align:start position:0%
that the L there's maybe just a
 
02:06:07.189 --> 02:06:07.199 align:start position:0%
difference of opinion on How likely it
 
02:06:09.229 --> 02:06:09.239 align:start position:0%
is that they would be a hearing every 60
 
02:06:12.669 --> 02:06:12.679 align:start position:0%
days versus every 30 days as I read the
 
02:06:15.910 --> 02:06:15.920 align:start position:0%
amendment that passed the house um there
 
02:06:18.830 --> 02:06:18.840 align:start position:0%
is not a standard that needs to be met
 
02:06:20.270 --> 02:06:20.280 align:start position:0%
in order for there to be a 30-day
 
02:06:22.750 --> 02:06:22.760 align:start position:0%
hearing so it is just if any party
 
02:06:24.990 --> 02:06:25.000 align:start position:0%
requests to have a 30-day hearing I
 
02:06:28.189 --> 02:06:28.199 align:start position:0%
think uh you I I don't have a specific
 
02:06:30.069 --> 02:06:30.079 align:start position:0%
number of how frequent this is but I did
 
02:06:31.549 --> 02:06:31.559 align:start position:0%
talk to a few different judges that do
 
02:06:33.430 --> 02:06:33.440 align:start position:0%
these cases frequently to get at least
 
02:06:36.229 --> 02:06:36.239 align:start position:0%
their anecdotal sample and uh what I
 
02:06:38.270 --> 02:06:38.280 align:start position:0%
heard was that it is almost always the
 
02:06:39.950 --> 02:06:39.960 align:start position:0%
case that certainly an abuse and neglect
 
02:06:42.069 --> 02:06:42.079 align:start position:0%
case that the parents are seeking the
 
02:06:43.750 --> 02:06:43.760 align:start position:0%
return of their child they have an
 
02:06:45.750 --> 02:06:45.760 align:start position:0%
attorney who's paid for by the judicial
 
02:06:47.229 --> 02:06:47.239 align:start position:0%
Council so they're not resource Limited
 
02:06:49.149 --> 02:06:49.159 align:start position:0%
in their ability to file a motion or
 
02:06:52.390 --> 02:06:52.400 align:start position:0%
request this hearing uh so I do expect
 
02:06:54.510 --> 02:06:54.520 align:start position:0%
that and and it's also my understanding
 
02:06:56.229 --> 02:06:56.239 align:start position:0%
that children generally want to return
 
02:06:57.549 --> 02:06:57.559 align:start position:0%
to the community that they're coming
 
02:07:00.589 --> 02:07:00.599 align:start position:0%
from uh so they are seeking a foster
 
02:07:02.030 --> 02:07:02.040 align:start position:0%
placement as opposed to residential
 
02:07:05.069 --> 02:07:05.079 align:start position:0%
placement uh so it it is my expectation
 
02:07:07.149 --> 02:07:07.159 align:start position:0%
that it would be much more likely than
 
02:07:08.990 --> 02:07:09.000 align:start position:0%
not that there would be 30-day review
 
02:07:11.229 --> 02:07:11.239 align:start position:0%
because there would be someone objecting
 
02:07:12.709 --> 02:07:12.719 align:start position:0%
to the continued residential placement
 
02:07:15.109 --> 02:07:15.119 align:start position:0%
if not the child or their representative
 
02:07:16.709 --> 02:07:16.719 align:start position:0%
then one of the parents potentially
 
02:07:19.270 --> 02:07:19.280 align:start position:0%
seeking uh the return of the child so I
 
02:07:22.069 --> 02:07:22.079 align:start position:0%
I don't I I think that those C's view is
 
02:07:23.950 --> 02:07:23.960 align:start position:0%
that if you move from 90 to 60 it's only
 
02:07:26.149 --> 02:07:26.159 align:start position:0%
a 50% increase in hearings six a year
 
02:07:28.470 --> 02:07:28.480 align:start position:0%
versus four a year and it is it is
 
02:07:30.069 --> 02:07:30.079 align:start position:0%
really my expectation that it would be
 
02:07:32.990 --> 02:07:33.000 align:start position:0%
closer to 12 um I'm not trying to
 
02:07:34.589 --> 02:07:34.599 align:start position:0%
frustrate the underlying policy
 
02:07:36.709 --> 02:07:36.719 align:start position:0%
objective of the bill which is to get
 
02:07:39.030 --> 02:07:39.040 align:start position:0%
more judicial involvement more hearings
 
02:07:42.750 --> 02:07:42.760 align:start position:0%
more timely more process by suggesting
 
02:07:44.669 --> 02:07:44.679 align:start position:0%
anything that would frustrate that
 
02:07:47.750 --> 02:07:47.760 align:start position:0%
policy objective but if it is a part of
 
02:07:50.109 --> 02:07:50.119 align:start position:0%
the policy objective to have fewer
 
02:07:51.709 --> 02:07:51.719 align:start position:0%
30-day hearings there are things that
 
02:07:53.790 --> 02:07:53.800 align:start position:0%
you could do you could say only for good
 
02:07:56.149 --> 02:07:56.159 align:start position:0%
cause have every 30 days or otherwise
 
02:07:59.709 --> 02:07:59.719 align:start position:0%
it's 60 days um that may not be enough
 
02:08:02.750 --> 02:08:02.760 align:start position:0%
to meet what's being sought in this bill
 
02:08:04.790 --> 02:08:04.800 align:start position:0%
but it's it is my expectation when I
 
02:08:07.709 --> 02:08:07.719 align:start position:0%
made this uh estimate that it would be
 
02:08:10.910 --> 02:08:10.920 align:start position:0%
2400 additional hearings a year which at
 
02:08:12.790 --> 02:08:12.800 align:start position:0%
a rate of about an hour and a half
 
02:08:14.109 --> 02:08:14.119 align:start position:0%
assuming a judge takes about an hour and
 
02:08:15.950 --> 02:08:15.960 align:start position:0%
a half to prepare do the hearing and
 
02:08:18.709 --> 02:08:18.719 align:start position:0%
issue all necessary rulings would be to
 
02:08:20.310 --> 02:08:20.320 align:start position:0%
full-time judicial
 
02:08:23.229 --> 02:08:23.239 align:start position:0%
officers um um the staff estimate is
 
02:08:25.109 --> 02:08:25.119 align:start position:0%
just based on a weighted case load study
 
02:08:27.750 --> 02:08:27.760 align:start position:0%
that we did in July of 2022 that showed
 
02:08:29.109 --> 02:08:29.119 align:start position:0%
that abuse and neglect in residential
 
02:08:31.270 --> 02:08:31.280 align:start position:0%
placement cases take a very large amount
 
02:08:33.229 --> 02:08:33.239 align:start position:0%
of clerk time they're confidential
 
02:08:35.189 --> 02:08:35.199 align:start position:0%
they're paper intensive there are hear a
 
02:08:37.229 --> 02:08:37.239 align:start position:0%
lot of hearings um so they just happen
 
02:08:39.430 --> 02:08:39.440 align:start position:0%
to take up a lot of clerk times that's
 
02:08:41.189 --> 02:08:41.199 align:start position:0%
based on our historical understanding of
 
02:08:43.189 --> 02:08:43.199 align:start position:0%
how much clerical work goes into these
 
02:08:45.950 --> 02:08:45.960 align:start position:0%
types of hearings um it is a big ground
 
02:08:47.350 --> 02:08:47.360 align:start position:0%
estimate so it's just taking the number
 
02:08:49.510 --> 02:08:49.520 align:start position:0%
of hearings times a a guess at about an
 
02:08:51.990 --> 02:08:52.000 align:start position:0%
hour and a half of judicial time and a a
 
02:08:54.510 --> 02:08:54.520 align:start position:0%
a past standard on how often we use how
 
02:08:56.229 --> 02:08:56.239 align:start position:0%
much clerical time we use in these case
 
02:08:58.910 --> 02:08:58.920 align:start position:0%
types uh so that's how we arrived at
 
02:09:00.030 --> 02:09:00.040 align:start position:0%
this estimate and and there are
 
02:09:01.830 --> 02:09:01.840 align:start position:0%
certainly ways that you could reduce the
 
02:09:03.109 --> 02:09:03.119 align:start position:0%
cost but I I don't want to suggest
 
02:09:04.310 --> 02:09:04.320 align:start position:0%
something that would also frustrate the
 
02:09:04.320 --> 02:09:07.510 align:start position:0%
something that would also frustrate the
policy

02:09:07.510 --> 02:09:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:11.149 --> 02:09:11.159 align:start position:0%
objective okay so um let let's let's
 
02:09:12.750 --> 02:09:12.760 align:start position:0%
back up to the beginning of what you
 
02:09:16.229 --> 02:09:16.239 align:start position:0%
were saying Miss kin I
 
02:09:18.109 --> 02:09:18.119 align:start position:0%
I this
 
02:09:20.549 --> 02:09:20.559 align:start position:0%
division understands the Department of
 
02:09:22.390 --> 02:09:22.400 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Service really really
 
02:09:24.870 --> 02:09:24.880 align:start position:0%
well what we do not understand because
 
02:09:27.030 --> 02:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
we're not exposed to it is the way that
 
02:09:29.430 --> 02:09:29.440 align:start position:0%
the Judiciary works and your explanation
 
02:09:31.270 --> 02:09:31.280 align:start position:0%
to how you did your workload count is
 
02:09:34.629 --> 02:09:34.639 align:start position:0%
all great I I would just encourage you
 
02:09:38.830 --> 02:09:38.840 align:start position:0%
in this instance in this bill um to to
 
02:09:41.030 --> 02:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
to be uh to give yourself permission to
 
02:09:44.310 --> 02:09:44.320 align:start position:0%
think a little bit differently uh we I
 
02:09:47.430 --> 02:09:47.440 align:start position:0%
know what I don't know and I don't know
 
02:09:49.870 --> 02:09:49.880 align:start position:0%
how the judicial aspect of this works
 
02:09:52.310 --> 02:09:52.320 align:start position:0%
and I like the idea that you support
 
02:09:54.189 --> 02:09:54.199 align:start position:0%
that we want to maintain a policy
 
02:09:57.430 --> 02:09:57.440 align:start position:0%
objective but but what I'm what I need
 
02:09:59.830 --> 02:09:59.840 align:start position:0%
and what I hope you're you're you're
 
02:10:05.030 --> 02:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
comfortable with is to um help us take a
 
02:10:08.189 --> 02:10:08.199 align:start position:0%
look at the processes that this law
 
02:10:11.270 --> 02:10:11.280 align:start position:0%
would uh Define and
 
02:10:15.069 --> 02:10:15.079 align:start position:0%
impose uh and see if there's uh maybe
 
02:10:18.069 --> 02:10:18.079 align:start position:0%
another way to do it in which uh we can
 
02:10:20.990 --> 02:10:21.000 align:start position:0%
still maintain quality and and uh and
 
02:10:24.629 --> 02:10:24.639 align:start position:0%
appr appropriateness of the the timing
 
02:10:27.390 --> 02:10:27.400 align:start position:0%
and in result of the
 
02:10:30.229 --> 02:10:30.239 align:start position:0%
decisions and but maybe do it in a a
 
02:10:32.830 --> 02:10:32.840 align:start position:0%
more a less restrictive more flexible
 
02:10:34.990 --> 02:10:35.000 align:start position:0%
Manner and I think I heard you say
 
02:10:37.910 --> 02:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
something about um you know that that
 
02:10:40.629 --> 02:10:40.639 align:start position:0%
maybe there may be an alternative to
 
02:10:43.870 --> 02:10:43.880 align:start position:0%
where we can do some of this on an exp
 
02:10:45.830 --> 02:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
parte or an emergency
 
02:10:50.030 --> 02:10:50.040 align:start position:0%
basis um as opposed to as as
 
02:10:52.669 --> 02:10:52.679 align:start position:0%
prescriptive as it is and I I I don't
 
02:10:55.510 --> 02:10:55.520 align:start position:0%
want to put words in your mouth I I I be
 
02:10:58.430 --> 02:10:58.440 align:start position:0%
I just am not fully understanding the
 
02:11:01.270 --> 02:11:01.280 align:start position:0%
the what your workload is and if there's
 
02:11:04.589 --> 02:11:04.599 align:start position:0%
a a smart way to change the workload
 
02:11:07.390 --> 02:11:07.400 align:start position:0%
requirements as this law would do while
 
02:11:11.270 --> 02:11:11.280 align:start position:0%
still protecting the the
 
02:11:13.310 --> 02:11:13.320 align:start position:0%
children thank you for the question I
 
02:11:15.310 --> 02:11:15.320 align:start position:0%
think that uh Miss massio was mentioning
 
02:11:17.510 --> 02:11:17.520 align:start position:0%
that the there was an emergency
 
02:11:19.990 --> 02:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
exception put in at our request just
 
02:11:22.149 --> 02:11:22.159 align:start position:0%
because we weren't certain what the
 
02:11:24.430 --> 02:11:24.440 align:start position:0%
legislature's intention in an emergency
 
02:11:25.830 --> 02:11:25.840 align:start position:0%
situation where we could not do this
 
02:11:28.350 --> 02:11:28.360 align:start position:0%
full process um where we have to place a
 
02:11:30.709 --> 02:11:30.719 align:start position:0%
child maybe that day that night and we
 
02:11:32.430 --> 02:11:32.440 align:start position:0%
might not have assessments from when
 
02:11:34.149 --> 02:11:34.159 align:start position:0%
they were eight uh you know all
 
02:11:35.510 --> 02:11:35.520 align:start position:0%
assessments we might not have the
 
02:11:37.030 --> 02:11:37.040 align:start position:0%
documentation to the level that you
 
02:11:38.990 --> 02:11:39.000 align:start position:0%
would desire to have in a Fuller and
 
02:11:42.350 --> 02:11:42.360 align:start position:0%
more uh planned premeditated hearing and
 
02:11:44.390 --> 02:11:44.400 align:start position:0%
I see that that was added and that's
 
02:11:46.390 --> 02:11:46.400 align:start position:0%
appreciated because we just want to have
 
02:11:47.870 --> 02:11:47.880 align:start position:0%
the guidance of the legislature on what
 
02:11:50.229 --> 02:11:50.239 align:start position:0%
we do if not this full
 
02:11:50.239 --> 02:11:53.830 align:start position:0%
we do if not this full
process

02:11:53.830 --> 02:11:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:57.549 --> 02:11:57.559 align:start position:0%
P page three line
 
02:12:02.709 --> 02:12:02.719 align:start position:0%
27 added except in emergency
 
02:12:06.709 --> 02:12:06.719 align:start position:0%
situations I would note though that it
 
02:12:12.830 --> 02:12:12.840 align:start position:0%
looks like the other language I proposed
 
02:12:16.589 --> 02:12:16.599 align:start position:0%
a DHHS did not make
 
02:12:20.030 --> 02:12:20.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:21.870 --> 02:12:21.880 align:start position:0%
find um
 
02:12:23.669 --> 02:12:23.679 align:start position:0%
oh for the rest of the emergency so
 
02:12:25.109 --> 02:12:25.119 align:start position:0%
there's more to the emergency I just
 
02:12:26.750 --> 02:12:26.760 align:start position:0%
noticed while I was looking there's
 
02:12:29.030 --> 02:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
another paragraph for the emergency
 
02:12:31.229 --> 02:12:31.239 align:start position:0%
situation which would tell them what to
 
02:12:36.149 --> 02:12:36.159 align:start position:0%
do then um so and it it sort of mirrors
 
02:12:39.030 --> 02:12:39.040 align:start position:0%
uh language in HB 535 which the house
 
02:12:42.229 --> 02:12:42.239 align:start position:0%
passed related to um giving counsel to
 
02:12:44.750 --> 02:12:44.760 align:start position:0%
children in residential so what it says
 
02:12:47.350 --> 02:12:47.360 align:start position:0%
and I can give you this language in the
 
02:12:49.109 --> 02:12:49.119 align:start position:0%
case of an emergency necessitating
 
02:12:51.830 --> 02:12:51.840 align:start position:0%
immediate placement to make that all Ed
 
02:12:53.549 --> 02:12:53.559 align:start position:0%
the department shall notify the court
 
02:12:55.310 --> 02:12:55.320 align:start position:0%
within two business days of such
 
02:12:57.870 --> 02:12:57.880 align:start position:0%
placement in order for the court to make
 
02:13:03.549 --> 02:13:03.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:08.430 --> 02:13:08.440 align:start position:0%
one so so I would ask the smart people
 
02:13:12.109 --> 02:13:12.119 align:start position:0%
to to see if there's a way because I'm
 
02:13:14.069 --> 02:13:14.079 align:start position:0%
just looking at it as a workload issue
 
02:13:19.030 --> 02:13:19.040 align:start position:0%
in theory is if we re reduced the
 
02:13:21.950 --> 02:13:21.960 align:start position:0%
prescriptive uh aspects of what we must
 
02:13:27.069 --> 02:13:27.079 align:start position:0%
do through the court system um with um a
 
02:13:30.669 --> 02:13:30.679 align:start position:0%
a more responsive flexible emergency
 
02:13:33.589 --> 02:13:33.599 align:start position:0%
component uh then that would possibly be
 
02:13:36.910 --> 02:13:36.920 align:start position:0%
a way in which we could take some of the
 
02:13:40.549 --> 02:13:40.559 align:start position:0%
uh overhead costs out while still
 
02:13:42.549 --> 02:13:42.559 align:start position:0%
preserving what we're trying to do which
 
02:13:45.430 --> 02:13:45.440 align:start position:0%
is to give good judicial review of each
 
02:13:47.589 --> 02:13:47.599 align:start position:0%
kid's case when the kids's case needs to
 
02:13:50.510 --> 02:13:50.520 align:start position:0%
be reviewed so we we definitely have a
 
02:13:50.520 --> 02:13:51.549 align:start position:0%
be reviewed so we we definitely have a
suggestion

02:13:51.549 --> 02:13:51.559 align:start position:0%
suggestion
 
02:13:52.910 --> 02:13:52.920 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we had not gotten to talk
 
02:13:54.950 --> 02:13:54.960 align:start position:0%
to Aaron before so I hear how they're
 
02:13:56.750 --> 02:13:56.760 align:start position:0%
interpreting that 30-day piece which
 
02:14:00.030 --> 02:14:00.040 align:start position:0%
sounds like the big bulk of the issue I
 
02:14:03.270 --> 02:14:03.280 align:start position:0%
think two things we could easily do we
 
02:14:07.149 --> 02:14:07.159 align:start position:0%
had intended for the objection to be
 
02:14:09.229 --> 02:14:09.239 align:start position:0%
really that the residential placement
 
02:14:12.709 --> 02:14:12.719 align:start position:0%
doesn't meet the child's needs versus
 
02:14:14.229 --> 02:14:14.239 align:start position:0%
just anybody get to say I don't want
 
02:14:15.709 --> 02:14:15.719 align:start position:0%
them in residential care so we can
 
02:14:18.589 --> 02:14:18.599 align:start position:0%
certainly take the any party out and
 
02:14:21.549 --> 02:14:21.559 align:start position:0%
make it clear that it's when the child
 
02:14:23.030 --> 02:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
or the child's representative which
 
02:14:24.750 --> 02:14:24.760 align:start position:0%
would potentially be an attorney under
 
02:14:28.629 --> 02:14:28.639 align:start position:0%
those other bills says court it's not
 
02:14:30.910 --> 02:14:30.920 align:start position:0%
meeting the level of care that all these
 
02:14:33.109 --> 02:14:33.119 align:start position:0%
assessments are saying a more technical
 
02:14:34.430 --> 02:14:34.440 align:start position:0%
issue not just I don't want to go to
 
02:14:36.030 --> 02:14:36.040 align:start position:0%
residential care because that was not
 
02:14:37.709 --> 02:14:37.719 align:start position:0%
our intent but I do understand why it's
 
02:14:40.549 --> 02:14:40.559 align:start position:0%
being read that way I think another um
 
02:14:43.030 --> 02:14:43.040 align:start position:0%
good solution to to again cut that cost
 
02:14:46.589 --> 02:14:46.599 align:start position:0%
without losing protection is if the
 
02:14:48.549 --> 02:14:48.559 align:start position:0%
objection is made that you're not
 
02:14:50.669 --> 02:14:50.679 align:start position:0%
meeting the level of care have the
 
02:14:52.589 --> 02:14:52.599 align:start position:0%
hearing at 30 days and then after that
 
02:14:56.270 --> 02:14:56.280 align:start position:0%
every 60 not have it keep being 30 which
 
02:14:58.629 --> 02:14:58.639 align:start position:0%
would again reduce the cost
 
02:15:01.870 --> 02:15:01.880 align:start position:0%
substantially um I would say so
 
02:15:04.069 --> 02:15:04.079 align:start position:0%
currently anybody can file an xart day
 
02:15:05.790 --> 02:15:05.800 align:start position:0%
motion whenever they want if somebody
 
02:15:08.189 --> 02:15:08.199 align:start position:0%
sees an issue particularly if children
 
02:15:09.709 --> 02:15:09.719 align:start position:0%
in residential care are granted
 
02:15:12.350 --> 02:15:12.360 align:start position:0%
attorneys as pass the house in
 
02:15:15.270 --> 02:15:15.280 align:start position:0%
January you can always file an expart
 
02:15:18.270 --> 02:15:18.280 align:start position:0%
Day saying something bad is happening um
 
02:15:22.229 --> 02:15:22.239 align:start position:0%
and we hope that people do I think um
 
02:15:24.350 --> 02:15:24.360 align:start position:0%
the fear of that the other side of the
 
02:15:25.910 --> 02:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
liability issue though is again we're
 
02:15:28.069 --> 02:15:28.079 align:start position:0%
having all these conversations about the
 
02:15:29.950 --> 02:15:29.960 align:start position:0%
the harm caused by residential care if
 
02:15:33.270 --> 02:15:33.280 align:start position:0%
you wait for something bad to happen and
 
02:15:36.109 --> 02:15:36.119 align:start position:0%
then file something now something bad
 
02:15:39.310 --> 02:15:39.320 align:start position:0%
has happened so um I think we're trying
 
02:15:41.589 --> 02:15:41.599 align:start position:0%
to balance the having increased
 
02:15:43.750 --> 02:15:43.760 align:start position:0%
oversight so nothing bad does happen
 
02:15:47.669 --> 02:15:47.679 align:start position:0%
with not overbearing on the system so to
 
02:15:51.189 --> 02:15:51.199 align:start position:0%
that point uh we're we're we're
 
02:15:53.430 --> 02:15:53.440 align:start position:0%
increasing the amount of surveillance on
 
02:15:55.470 --> 02:15:55.480 align:start position:0%
the part of the case
 
02:15:59.709 --> 02:15:59.719 align:start position:0%
managers uh I would assume that uh the
 
02:16:03.229 --> 02:16:03.239 align:start position:0%
the greatest future source of expart
 
02:16:05.470 --> 02:16:05.480 align:start position:0%
motions would be from the case
 
02:16:08.149 --> 02:16:08.159 align:start position:0%
managers because they they would be the
 
02:16:10.990 --> 02:16:11.000 align:start position:0%
ones explicitly looking to see if
 
02:16:13.870 --> 02:16:13.880 align:start position:0%
something is a foul of the certification
 
02:16:13.880 --> 02:16:15.229 align:start position:0%
something is a foul of the certification
and

02:16:15.229 --> 02:16:15.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:16:15.239 --> 02:16:18.229 align:start position:0%
and
just

02:16:18.229 --> 02:16:18.239 align:start position:0%
just
 
02:16:22.109 --> 02:16:22.119 align:start position:0%
decency having been a DC attorney I
 
02:16:25.189 --> 02:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
would not assume that I think if a
 
02:16:27.629 --> 02:16:27.639 align:start position:0%
worker saw something going on they would
 
02:16:29.750 --> 02:16:29.760 align:start position:0%
probably go to their supervisor maybe to
 
02:16:33.349 --> 02:16:33.359 align:start position:0%
bcbh typically the division and maybe
 
02:16:36.669 --> 02:16:36.679 align:start position:0%
Susan has a different take on this
 
02:16:39.910 --> 02:16:39.920 align:start position:0%
wouldn't CP workers can move kids around
 
02:16:42.070 --> 02:16:42.080 align:start position:0%
without court order so I don't think
 
02:16:43.669 --> 02:16:43.679 align:start position:0%
they would be filing a motion they would
 
02:16:45.270 --> 02:16:45.280 align:start position:0%
start investigating new placements and
 
02:16:48.589 --> 02:16:48.599 align:start position:0%
move the kid um I would Envision it'd be
 
02:16:51.270 --> 02:16:51.280 align:start position:0%
the child's attorney potentially that
 
02:16:54.469 --> 02:16:54.479 align:start position:0%
might file emergency motions based on
 
02:16:57.870 --> 02:16:57.880 align:start position:0%
what they're perceiving as their clients
 
02:17:02.030 --> 02:17:02.040 align:start position:0%
needs okay but I I so this is a new area
 
02:17:04.110 --> 02:17:04.120 align:start position:0%
to me so I'm sorry if this is really
 
02:17:07.549 --> 02:17:07.559 align:start position:0%
basic but uh do do every does every kid
 
02:17:09.549 --> 02:17:09.559 align:start position:0%
have an attorney I I I would imagine
 
02:17:12.990 --> 02:17:13.000 align:start position:0%
this is a really um under underserved
 
02:17:14.709 --> 02:17:14.719 align:start position:0%
population and they don't have attorneys
 
02:17:17.549 --> 02:17:17.559 align:start position:0%
running around why why wouldn't we want
 
02:17:19.830 --> 02:17:19.840 align:start position:0%
the case managers as part of their
 
02:17:24.110 --> 02:17:24.120 align:start position:0%
duties to potentially file a judicial
 
02:17:27.910 --> 02:17:27.920 align:start position:0%
review request right and I think overall
 
02:17:30.230 --> 02:17:30.240 align:start position:0%
I feel like we keep leaving out Juvenile
 
02:17:31.709 --> 02:17:31.719 align:start position:0%
Justice with these cases so with
 
02:17:34.110 --> 02:17:34.120 align:start position:0%
Juvenile Justice yes every Chin's case
 
02:17:35.589 --> 02:17:35.599 align:start position:0%
every delinquency case they have an
 
02:17:39.230 --> 02:17:39.240 align:start position:0%
attorney and that meets um 93 of those
 
02:17:41.150 --> 02:17:41.160 align:start position:0%
kids are juvenile
 
02:17:43.910 --> 02:17:43.920 align:start position:0%
kids as Lisa pointed out there are two
 
02:17:47.669 --> 02:17:47.679 align:start position:0%
bills that are um moving forward uh in
 
02:17:49.589 --> 02:17:49.599 align:start position:0%
the legislature this term that would
 
02:17:53.910 --> 02:17:53.920 align:start position:0%
allow for a a child that not only have
 
02:17:56.990 --> 02:17:57.000 align:start position:0%
um a casa G appointed at the time of a
 
02:17:59.389 --> 02:17:59.399 align:start position:0%
CPS case a child protection case or 169
 
02:18:03.070 --> 02:18:03.080 align:start position:0%
C case they will also have may have an
 
02:18:04.629 --> 02:18:04.639 align:start position:0%
attorney appointed to them and if their
 
02:18:06.110 --> 02:18:06.120 align:start position:0%
imp placement or placement is
 
02:18:08.190 --> 02:18:08.200 align:start position:0%
contemplated they shall have an attorney
 
02:18:11.230 --> 02:18:11.240 align:start position:0%
appointment to them okay so that's good
 
02:18:14.990 --> 02:18:15.000 align:start position:0%
education thank you uh do we currently
 
02:18:17.990 --> 02:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
or do we anticipate having the case
 
02:18:22.070 --> 02:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
managers also be aware of their kids
 
02:18:24.870 --> 02:18:24.880 align:start position:0%
attorney so that the case
 
02:18:28.070 --> 02:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
manager is encouraged to contact the
 
02:18:31.549 --> 02:18:31.559 align:start position:0%
attorney to if they see something wrong
 
02:18:33.589 --> 02:18:33.599 align:start position:0%
is that is that part of the process or
 
02:18:36.509 --> 02:18:36.519 align:start position:0%
or it's a dumb thing to do what is it no
 
02:18:38.070 --> 02:18:38.080 align:start position:0%
and I think that's what written to both
 
02:18:40.629 --> 02:18:40.639 align:start position:0%
bills how if placement is contemplated
 
02:18:43.910 --> 02:18:43.920 align:start position:0%
an attorney shall be represented uh
 
02:18:45.990 --> 02:18:46.000 align:start position:0%
appointed and they shall represent them
 
02:18:48.549 --> 02:18:48.559 align:start position:0%
at treatment meetings as well correct
 
02:18:50.910 --> 02:18:50.920 align:start position:0%
similar to JJ they are able to if they
 
02:18:53.150 --> 02:18:53.160 align:start position:0%
choose to do so I would say um you
 
02:18:55.030 --> 02:18:55.040 align:start position:0%
coming from a state where all children
 
02:18:56.389 --> 02:18:56.399 align:start position:0%
and child welfare worked in the state of
 
02:18:57.669 --> 02:18:57.679 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts all children and child
 
02:19:00.190 --> 02:19:00.200 align:start position:0%
welfare were assigned attorneys and yes
 
02:19:01.790 --> 02:19:01.800 align:start position:0%
it was the responsibility of the case
 
02:19:02.910 --> 02:19:02.920 align:start position:0%
workers to communicate with those
 
02:19:04.830 --> 02:19:04.840 align:start position:0%
children's attorneys make sure that they
 
02:19:06.589 --> 02:19:06.599 align:start position:0%
were aware of any concerns update them
 
02:19:07.830 --> 02:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
if there was something that they learned
 
02:19:09.030 --> 02:19:09.040 align:start position:0%
that the attorney did not gather the
 
02:19:11.190 --> 02:19:11.200 align:start position:0%
information first so if we're looking at
 
02:19:13.830 --> 02:19:13.840 align:start position:0%
best practice if 535 continues to move
 
02:19:15.389 --> 02:19:15.399 align:start position:0%
forward and we are looking at best
 
02:19:17.750 --> 02:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
practice best practice would be that
 
02:19:20.030 --> 02:19:20.040 align:start position:0%
they are there is some form of open
 
02:19:22.190 --> 02:19:22.200 align:start position:0%
communication between both parties so so
 
02:19:24.870 --> 02:19:24.880 align:start position:0%
in the prior sections that we reviewed
 
02:19:28.549 --> 02:19:28.559 align:start position:0%
today there was no mention of of the
 
02:19:30.910 --> 02:19:30.920 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the case manager to
 
02:19:33.709 --> 02:19:33.719 align:start position:0%
also conduct periodic conversations with
 
02:19:37.309 --> 02:19:37.319 align:start position:0%
the attorney neither periodic nor
 
02:19:39.669 --> 02:19:39.679 align:start position:0%
exigent so I'm just wondering did we
 
02:19:42.389 --> 02:19:42.399 align:start position:0%
miss something that we should put in
 
02:19:45.070 --> 02:19:45.080 align:start position:0%
here no the reason why that isn't in
 
02:19:48.509 --> 02:19:48.519 align:start position:0%
there currently um in part is because
 
02:19:50.349 --> 02:19:50.359 align:start position:0%
we're talking about right now it's only
 
02:19:53.070 --> 02:19:53.080 align:start position:0%
speciic to Juvenile Justice cases um
 
02:19:55.830 --> 02:19:55.840 align:start position:0%
because 535 is still in motion so if
 
02:19:59.070 --> 02:19:59.080 align:start position:0%
that is to pass fully through then at
 
02:20:00.710 --> 02:20:00.720 align:start position:0%
that point that's something that
 
02:20:02.630 --> 02:20:02.640 align:start position:0%
typically would be developed in a
 
02:20:05.670 --> 02:20:05.680 align:start position:0%
standard operating procedure policy for
 
02:20:07.230 --> 02:20:07.240 align:start position:0%
the division of how they manage that
 
02:20:08.870 --> 02:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
contact with the attorney
 
02:20:12.790 --> 02:20:12.800 align:start position:0%
but it we have not aligned in a sense
 
02:20:15.510 --> 02:20:15.520 align:start position:0%
where we can say we're confident we know
 
02:20:17.309 --> 02:20:17.319 align:start position:0%
100% that bill is going to pass and so
 
02:20:18.710 --> 02:20:18.720 align:start position:0%
we're going to incorporate pieces of
 
02:20:22.270 --> 02:20:22.280 align:start position:0%
that bill tied back into this so
 
02:20:25.070 --> 02:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
I I don't know how you look at it but I
 
02:20:27.830 --> 02:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
look at it that this bill has to stand
 
02:20:29.270 --> 02:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
alone I'm not going to make any
 
02:20:31.030 --> 02:20:31.040 align:start position:0%
assumption that some parallel Bill
 
02:20:33.150 --> 02:20:33.160 align:start position:0%
somewhere is going to pass I I want this
 
02:20:36.110 --> 02:20:36.120 align:start position:0%
bill to be right what regardless of what
 
02:20:39.070 --> 02:20:39.080 align:start position:0%
the Senate thinks they're doing so if if
 
02:20:41.349 --> 02:20:41.359 align:start position:0%
if if there's some aspect that you think
 
02:20:43.150 --> 02:20:43.160 align:start position:0%
is going to be taken by
 
02:20:46.070 --> 02:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
535 that maybe we ought to be putting in
 
02:20:49.150 --> 02:20:49.160 align:start position:0%
here as well then I I'm I'm open to that
 
02:20:51.230 --> 02:20:51.240 align:start position:0%
because I don't want to assume 5 35
 
02:20:53.429 --> 02:20:53.439 align:start position:0%
passes I think
 
02:20:55.910 --> 02:20:55.920 align:start position:0%
currently at the review hearings and and
 
02:20:58.150 --> 02:20:58.160 align:start position:0%
would be required for new new review
 
02:21:02.070 --> 02:21:02.080 align:start position:0%
hearings workers produce reports with
 
02:21:04.630 --> 02:21:04.640 align:start position:0%
information about all the contacts one
 
02:21:05.950 --> 02:21:05.960 align:start position:0%
of the reasons we want that more
 
02:21:08.150 --> 02:21:08.160 align:start position:0%
thorough form is so that those monthly
 
02:21:10.469 --> 02:21:10.479 align:start position:0%
visits are are more detailed but that
 
02:21:12.750 --> 02:21:12.760 align:start position:0%
report goes out to every party in the
 
02:21:15.190 --> 02:21:15.200 align:start position:0%
case so it would go to the cost it does
 
02:21:17.910 --> 02:21:17.920 align:start position:0%
now go to the casa goes to the parents
 
02:21:20.150 --> 02:21:20.160 align:start position:0%
attorneys if a child has an attorney
 
02:21:23.910 --> 02:21:23.920 align:start position:0%
under 35 it would go to those folks too
 
02:21:26.510 --> 02:21:26.520 align:start position:0%
I you know it like cassandre said the
 
02:21:28.270 --> 02:21:28.280 align:start position:0%
kind of in between communication that's
 
02:21:30.710 --> 02:21:30.720 align:start position:0%
more informal via email or phone is sort
 
02:21:32.910 --> 02:21:32.920 align:start position:0%
of under standard operating procedure
 
02:21:35.030 --> 02:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
and the workers have their own dcyf
 
02:21:36.670 --> 02:21:36.680 align:start position:0%
attorneys as well so like they have an
 
02:21:39.230 --> 02:21:39.240 align:start position:0%
attorney internal to DCF that they could
 
02:21:40.910 --> 02:21:40.920 align:start position:0%
also raise it to hey I went to this
 
02:21:43.230 --> 02:21:43.240 align:start position:0%
facility really concerned so there there
 
02:21:44.870 --> 02:21:44.880 align:start position:0%
is also a process that the division
 
02:21:47.510 --> 02:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
could file something as well and just to
 
02:21:49.309 --> 02:21:49.319 align:start position:0%
clarify a little bit more so with with
 
02:21:52.950 --> 02:21:52.960 align:start position:0%
CPS with one 69 C cases there's an
 
02:21:56.389 --> 02:21:56.399 align:start position:0%
appointed G typically a casa worker at
 
02:21:58.270 --> 02:21:58.280 align:start position:0%
first instance if there's a conflict or
 
02:21:59.870 --> 02:21:59.880 align:start position:0%
they aren't able to serve that child
 
02:22:02.389 --> 02:22:02.399 align:start position:0%
than a private gal is appointed that
 
02:22:05.510 --> 02:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
private J and the casa or the casa G is
 
02:22:08.309 --> 02:22:08.319 align:start position:0%
meeting in person with the child every
 
02:22:11.389 --> 02:22:11.399 align:start position:0%
30 days as well as of now there are
 
02:22:14.830 --> 02:22:14.840 align:start position:0%
what's called 30 uh nine 90day Court
 
02:22:17.309 --> 02:22:17.319 align:start position:0%
review hearings with CPS they're
 
02:22:19.710 --> 02:22:19.720 align:start position:0%
typically called the three-month Court
 
02:22:22.150 --> 02:22:22.160 align:start position:0%
review hearing the six Monon the 9month
 
02:22:23.950 --> 02:22:23.960 align:start position:0%
leading to the 12-month permanency
 
02:22:26.429 --> 02:22:26.439 align:start position:0%
hearing at each of those review hearings
 
02:22:29.630 --> 02:22:29.640 align:start position:0%
a court report is um presented to the
 
02:22:33.230 --> 02:22:33.240 align:start position:0%
court dcyf does their own court report
 
02:22:34.630 --> 02:22:34.640 align:start position:0%
and that's where they're attaching
 
02:22:36.910 --> 02:22:36.920 align:start position:0%
updates from the residential placement
 
02:22:39.349 --> 02:22:39.359 align:start position:0%
that was referred to earlier in terms of
 
02:22:41.550 --> 02:22:41.560 align:start position:0%
the written correspondence that is
 
02:22:44.270 --> 02:22:44.280 align:start position:0%
attached to that court report G's are
 
02:22:46.469 --> 02:22:46.479 align:start position:0%
independently doing their own Court
 
02:22:49.750 --> 02:22:49.760 align:start position:0%
review Court re uh sorry review hearing
 
02:22:52.110 --> 02:22:52.120 align:start position:0%
court report as well giving updates as
 
02:22:54.150 --> 02:22:54.160 align:start position:0%
well to the child their wants their
 
02:22:56.630 --> 02:22:56.640 align:start position:0%
needs where they're at in the uh in the
 
02:22:56.640 --> 02:22:58.070 align:start position:0%
needs where they're at in the uh in the
treatment

02:22:58.070 --> 02:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
treatment
 
02:23:00.990 --> 02:23:01.000 align:start position:0%
process with jppo it's a little
 
02:23:03.590 --> 02:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
different they have was typically 90day
 
02:23:06.590 --> 02:23:06.600 align:start position:0%
it's called 90day Court review court
 
02:23:08.670 --> 02:23:08.680 align:start position:0%
court hearings Court review hearings
 
02:23:11.309 --> 02:23:11.319 align:start position:0%
where again the jppo is presenting to
 
02:23:14.269 --> 02:23:14.279 align:start position:0%
the court uh updates as to what has been
 
02:23:16.269 --> 02:23:16.279 align:start position:0%
going on at the facility how is the
 
02:23:18.590 --> 02:23:18.600 align:start position:0%
child doing where are they not and
 
02:23:21.269 --> 02:23:21.279 align:start position:0%
there's also Court oversight pursuant to
 
02:23:26.030 --> 02:23:26.040 align:start position:0%
169 c19 that the legislature passed in
 
02:23:28.910 --> 02:23:28.920 align:start position:0%
2021 placement and qualified Residential
 
02:23:31.230 --> 02:23:31.240 align:start position:0%
Treatment programs to align with federal
 
02:23:34.429 --> 02:23:34.439 align:start position:0%
law so this law uh as was spoken today
 
02:23:37.110 --> 02:23:37.120 align:start position:0%
is a little bit different from that in
 
02:23:39.950 --> 02:23:39.960 align:start position:0%
which in that law the assessment is
 
02:23:43.670 --> 02:23:43.680 align:start position:0%
reviewed um within 60 days of placement
 
02:23:46.030 --> 02:23:46.040 align:start position:0%
um for any child plac in a qualified
 
02:23:47.990 --> 02:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
residential treatment program as toine
 
02:23:49.670 --> 02:23:49.680 align:start position:0%
the federal Family First prevention
 
02:23:53.309 --> 02:23:53.319 align:start position:0%
service actor 2017 the court shall order
 
02:23:55.550 --> 02:23:55.560 align:start position:0%
an assessment to be completed within 30
 
02:23:58.389 --> 02:23:58.399 align:start position:0%
days of placement so now it's going to
 
02:24:00.469 --> 02:24:00.479 align:start position:0%
happen before placement right that first
 
02:24:03.030 --> 02:24:03.040 align:start position:0%
part of the statute says prior to
 
02:24:05.070 --> 02:24:05.080 align:start position:0%
existing law this is existing law passed
 
02:24:07.510 --> 02:24:07.520 align:start position:0%
by the legislature on July 9th uh went
 
02:24:12.230 --> 02:24:12.240 align:start position:0%
into effect July 9th 2029 that's 169 c19
 
02:24:14.590 --> 02:24:14.600 align:start position:0%
F placement in a qualified residential
 
02:24:17.429 --> 02:24:17.439 align:start position:0%
PR treatment program and then the court
 
02:24:19.309 --> 02:24:19.319 align:start position:0%
reviews that assessment and issues an
 
02:24:21.309 --> 02:24:21.319 align:start position:0%
order approving the placement or
 
02:24:23.990 --> 02:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
changing the placement within 60 days of
 
02:24:28.110 --> 02:24:28.120 align:start position:0%
placement and that is
 
02:24:32.670 --> 02:24:32.680 align:start position:0%
um court form 3207 motion for judicial
 
02:24:36.950 --> 02:24:36.960 align:start position:0%
judicial determination in 169 B CD cases
 
02:24:39.190 --> 02:24:39.200 align:start position:0%
regarding current residential treatment
 
02:24:42.030 --> 02:24:42.040 align:start position:0%
program so there is already Court
 
02:24:44.790 --> 02:24:44.800 align:start position:0%
oversight as to residential placement in
 
02:24:47.870 --> 02:24:47.880 align:start position:0%
align with the family First Act again
 
02:24:50.790 --> 02:24:50.800 align:start position:0%
because I'm a simple guy was was that a
 
02:24:53.469 --> 02:24:53.479 align:start position:0%
way of saying that the fiscal note
 
02:24:57.110 --> 02:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
saying we need nine new uh judicial
 
02:25:00.150 --> 02:25:00.160 align:start position:0%
positions to support this workload that
 
02:25:03.150 --> 02:25:03.160 align:start position:0%
that is that we may not need it because
 
02:25:05.950 --> 02:25:05.960 align:start position:0%
we already are supposed to have
 
02:25:09.469 --> 02:25:09.479 align:start position:0%
it this is happening um typically by
 
02:25:11.190 --> 02:25:11.200 align:start position:0%
motion practice and then the court
 
02:25:13.670 --> 02:25:13.680 align:start position:0%
reviews the placement uh the C What's
 
02:25:15.349 --> 02:25:15.359 align:start position:0%
called the comprehens so I'm looking for
 
02:25:17.110 --> 02:25:17.120 align:start position:0%
kind of a yes or
 
02:25:20.510 --> 02:25:20.520 align:start position:0%
no so so so if it's already an existing
 
02:25:24.630 --> 02:25:24.640 align:start position:0%
law and those obligations are already
 
02:25:27.230 --> 02:25:27.240 align:start position:0%
imposed what this fiscal Noe is meant to
 
02:25:29.469 --> 02:25:29.479 align:start position:0%
do for this new amendment is to take a
 
02:25:32.429 --> 02:25:32.439 align:start position:0%
look at the incremental costs the new
 
02:25:35.510 --> 02:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
costs associated with going above and
 
02:25:37.870 --> 02:25:37.880 align:start position:0%
beyond the existing law that's what this
 
02:25:40.349 --> 02:25:40.359 align:start position:0%
fiscal no it's intended to do I can
 
02:25:45.070 --> 02:25:45.080 align:start position:0%
clarify that piece for you um no because
 
02:25:47.349 --> 02:25:47.359 align:start position:0%
the so the law that um Susan just read
 
02:25:49.230 --> 02:25:49.240 align:start position:0%
for us is specific to qualified
 
02:25:50.910 --> 02:25:50.920 align:start position:0%
residential treatment program and that
 
02:25:54.590 --> 02:25:54.600 align:start position:0%
is tied to the title for money so that's
 
02:25:55.830 --> 02:25:55.840 align:start position:0%
the federal money that's why it's tied
 
02:25:57.389 --> 02:25:57.399 align:start position:0%
to the the language that's in the family
 
02:25:59.590 --> 02:25:59.600 align:start position:0%
first Prevention Services act it is
 
02:26:02.870 --> 02:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
intended only for facilities that are
 
02:26:05.750 --> 02:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
going to be provided or requesting the
 
02:26:08.230 --> 02:26:08.240 align:start position:0%
title for E funds not all children in
 
02:26:09.750 --> 02:26:09.760 align:start position:0%
residential placements placed by the
 
02:26:11.950 --> 02:26:11.960 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire are in qualified
 
02:26:13.429 --> 02:26:13.439 align:start position:0%
residential treatment program so what
 
02:26:15.550 --> 02:26:15.560 align:start position:0%
we're looking to do is capture all of
 
02:26:19.030 --> 02:26:19.040 align:start position:0%
the children placed under 169 BC and D
 
02:26:22.030 --> 02:26:22.040 align:start position:0%
that's only a small portion of
 
02:26:24.750 --> 02:26:24.760 align:start position:0%
that the the estimate that we did was
 
02:26:26.710 --> 02:26:26.720 align:start position:0%
based on the understanding that because
 
02:26:28.389 --> 02:26:28.399 align:start position:0%
there's an option for any party to raise
 
02:26:30.110 --> 02:26:30.120 align:start position:0%
a 30-day hearing without there being a
 
02:26:31.269 --> 02:26:31.279 align:start position:0%
specific standard that we would be
 
02:26:34.030 --> 02:26:34.040 align:start position:0%
moving from a deao 90 to a deao 30
 
02:26:36.590 --> 02:26:36.600 align:start position:0%
tripling our hearings um going from
 
02:26:39.910 --> 02:26:39.920 align:start position:0%
about 1,200 to about 3600 what I
 
02:26:41.469 --> 02:26:41.479 align:start position:0%
understand is that it it may be possible
 
02:26:44.469 --> 02:26:44.479 align:start position:0%
to achieve the policy objective uh while
 
02:26:46.070 --> 02:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
reducing that number of hearings and if
 
02:26:47.309 --> 02:26:47.319 align:start position:0%
that's the case it would absolutely
 
02:26:49.190 --> 02:26:49.200 align:start position:0%
lower the estimate that we have and and
 
02:26:51.309 --> 02:26:51.319 align:start position:0%
if I may add um so we were looking for a
 
02:26:53.830 --> 02:26:53.840 align:start position:0%
language we scoured many states to look
 
02:26:55.349 --> 02:26:55.359 align:start position:0%
for a language that already existed in
 
02:26:57.190 --> 02:26:57.200 align:start position:0%
law this is language that was pulled
 
02:26:58.990 --> 02:26:59.000 align:start position:0%
from I believe this specifically was
 
02:27:02.550 --> 02:27:02.560 align:start position:0%
from the state of New Jersey um so that
 
02:27:04.510 --> 02:27:04.520 align:start position:0%
is just pulling it as it is written
 
02:27:06.630 --> 02:27:06.640 align:start position:0%
there talking about the impact that that
 
02:27:08.950 --> 02:27:08.960 align:start position:0%
will have specifically on New Hampshire
 
02:27:12.030 --> 02:27:12.040 align:start position:0%
and the courts we see the ability to
 
02:27:14.070 --> 02:27:14.080 align:start position:0%
make those changes that Lisa mentioned
 
02:27:16.030 --> 02:27:16.040 align:start position:0%
we had not had many opportunities to
 
02:27:17.469 --> 02:27:17.479 align:start position:0%
speak with Erin prior to this so
 
02:27:19.510 --> 02:27:19.520 align:start position:0%
apologies for that Erin um but I do
 
02:27:22.030 --> 02:27:22.040 align:start position:0%
think we C we would have had no problem
 
02:27:23.830 --> 02:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
making those changes had we been aware
 
02:27:25.630 --> 02:27:25.640 align:start position:0%
of the impact on the courts and had some
 
02:27:27.190 --> 02:27:27.200 align:start position:0%
of these conversations and same with our
 
02:27:28.990 --> 02:27:29.000 align:start position:0%
request for additional attorneys because
 
02:27:30.550 --> 02:27:30.560 align:start position:0%
we were going with what's not in
 
02:27:34.950 --> 02:27:34.960 align:start position:0%
practice which is the um uh every 60-day
 
02:27:37.670 --> 02:27:37.680 align:start position:0%
review hearing and the possibility of
 
02:27:40.630 --> 02:27:40.640 align:start position:0%
every 30-day so either way it would be
 
02:27:43.990 --> 02:27:44.000 align:start position:0%
by minimum an an additional
 
02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:45.910 align:start position:0%
by minimum an an additional
1,722

02:27:45.910 --> 02:27:45.920 align:start position:0%
1,722
 
02:27:48.070 --> 02:27:48.080 align:start position:0%
hearings with
 
02:27:52.150 --> 02:27:52.160 align:start position:0%
1573 and at the maximum about
 
02:27:54.510 --> 02:27:54.520 align:start position:0%
3,444 additional hearings and that's
 
02:27:55.990 --> 02:27:56.000 align:start position:0%
where we came up with our need for
 
02:27:58.030 --> 02:27:58.040 align:start position:0%
additional attorneys there's no attorney
 
02:28:01.750 --> 02:28:01.760 align:start position:0%
request in this bill I I I didn't
 
02:28:03.030 --> 02:28:03.040 align:start position:0%
understand that last
 
02:28:05.309 --> 02:28:05.319 align:start position:0%
comment as far as my review of this bill
 
02:28:07.950 --> 02:28:07.960 align:start position:0%
there's no request for attorneys in this
 
02:28:10.630 --> 02:28:10.640 align:start position:0%
you have another there is none in the
 
02:28:14.309 --> 02:28:14.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:17.429 --> 02:28:17.439 align:start position:0%
sheeet okay so so again because I'm
 
02:28:20.670 --> 02:28:20.680 align:start position:0%
simple it sounded to me uh Miss krian
 
02:28:24.230 --> 02:28:24.240 align:start position:0%
that in just having this conversation
 
02:28:26.750 --> 02:28:26.760 align:start position:0%
you're comfortable with a different
 
02:28:29.670 --> 02:28:29.680 align:start position:0%
interpretation of what's been written
 
02:28:33.070 --> 02:28:33.080 align:start position:0%
such that it reduces the workload you
 
02:28:35.309 --> 02:28:35.319 align:start position:0%
thought may be incumbent upon the
 
02:28:37.510 --> 02:28:37.520 align:start position:0%
department I I again I don't want to put
 
02:28:39.950 --> 02:28:39.960 align:start position:0%
words in your mouth but did I hear that
 
02:28:42.870 --> 02:28:42.880 align:start position:0%
right um I don't think I can say yes or
 
02:28:43.910 --> 02:28:43.920 align:start position:0%
no but I just want to make sure I
 
02:28:46.150 --> 02:28:46.160 align:start position:0%
understand your statement um I think
 
02:28:48.269 --> 02:28:48.279 align:start position:0%
that it would need to be changed in the
 
02:28:50.150 --> 02:28:50.160 align:start position:0%
way that it is written in order to
 
02:28:51.630 --> 02:28:51.640 align:start position:0%
reduce the number of hearings but that
 
02:28:54.870 --> 02:28:54.880 align:start position:0%
was my next question and and and and to
 
02:28:57.269 --> 02:28:57.279 align:start position:0%
get your interpretation so that there's
 
02:28:59.910 --> 02:28:59.920 align:start position:0%
no confusion do we need to change the
 
02:29:01.750 --> 02:29:01.760 align:start position:0%
language and can you participate in
 
02:29:06.510 --> 02:29:06.520 align:start position:0%
helping do good that's great
 
02:29:09.590 --> 02:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
absolutely yeah if you can work with the
 
02:29:11.990 --> 02:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
child Advocates office to certainly get
 
02:29:19.030 --> 02:29:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:19.040 --> 02:29:21.550 align:start position:0%
 
you

02:29:21.550 --> 02:29:21.560 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:29:23.190 --> 02:29:23.200 align:start position:0%
question okay let's have a technical
 
02:29:27.070 --> 02:29:27.080 align:start position:0%
question okay so um because I I come
 
02:29:28.790 --> 02:29:28.800 align:start position:0%
back to this idea that a lot of
 
02:29:30.870 --> 02:29:30.880 align:start position:0%
decisions need to be made in a resource
 
02:29:33.750 --> 02:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
constrained environment and so when I'm
 
02:29:39.750 --> 02:29:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:43.630 --> 02:29:43.640 align:start position:0%
11 it it it it it basically says that
 
02:29:45.830 --> 02:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
that the decision for the child's
 
02:29:48.309 --> 02:29:48.319 align:start position:0%
residential treatment program is meant
 
02:29:51.630 --> 02:29:51.640 align:start position:0%
to be providing the most effective and
 
02:29:53.630 --> 02:29:53.640 align:start position:0%
appropriate level of
 
02:29:56.750 --> 02:29:56.760 align:start position:0%
care and and so the question of
 
02:30:00.750 --> 02:30:00.760 align:start position:0%
availability jumps in and so so I wonder
 
02:30:03.349 --> 02:30:03.359 align:start position:0%
if if maybe we could add a couple of
 
02:30:06.710 --> 02:30:06.720 align:start position:0%
words to to to to make sure that the the
 
02:30:08.349 --> 02:30:08.359 align:start position:0%
decision is most effective and
 
02:30:11.349 --> 02:30:11.359 align:start position:0%
appropriate given available
 
02:30:13.309 --> 02:30:13.319 align:start position:0%
Alternatives that is the language that
 
02:30:15.590 --> 02:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
is from federal Family First Prevention
 
02:30:18.030 --> 02:30:18.040 align:start position:0%
Services act and so so the feds got one
 
02:30:20.870 --> 02:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
right they did
 
02:30:22.389 --> 02:30:22.399 align:start position:0%
they did and so we would not want we
 
02:30:24.750 --> 02:30:24.760 align:start position:0%
have that reflected in our language then
 
02:30:27.309 --> 02:30:27.319 align:start position:0%
since we're trying to emulate the feds
 
02:30:29.950 --> 02:30:29.960 align:start position:0%
no so we have so that that what is
 
02:30:33.790 --> 02:30:33.800 align:start position:0%
written here now the most effective um
 
02:30:35.150 --> 02:30:35.160 align:start position:0%
and appropriate level of care for the
 
02:30:36.389 --> 02:30:36.399 align:start position:0%
child in the least restrictive
 
02:30:39.269 --> 02:30:39.279 align:start position:0%
environment that language is from the
 
02:30:41.230 --> 02:30:41.240 align:start position:0%
the federal language and so we are
 
02:30:42.870 --> 02:30:42.880 align:start position:0%
making sure that that is consistent and
 
02:30:46.590 --> 02:30:46.600 align:start position:0%
if we added something outside of that
 
02:30:48.750 --> 02:30:48.760 align:start position:0%
such as an exception due to resources we
 
02:30:52.550 --> 02:30:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:55.750 --> 02:30:55.760 align:start position:0%
fedal and then they would not give us
 
02:30:59.550 --> 02:30:59.560 align:start position:0%
M well if they caught
 
02:31:14.469 --> 02:31:14.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:17.550 --> 02:31:17.560 align:start position:0%
there pretty much Kevin could you talk
 
02:31:21.230 --> 02:31:21.240 align:start position:0%
to us for a minute about um um when we
 
02:31:26.110 --> 02:31:26.120 align:start position:0%
go forward forward with this there are
 
02:31:28.429 --> 02:31:28.439 align:start position:0%
additional at least in the fisal note
 
02:31:33.150 --> 02:31:33.160 align:start position:0%
they talk about additional um staff and
 
02:31:35.150 --> 02:31:35.160 align:start position:0%
Appropriations would that would need to
 
02:31:38.110 --> 02:31:38.120 align:start position:0%
be it seems like authorized in the bill
 
02:31:40.870 --> 02:31:40.880 align:start position:0%
right which were not previously that's
 
02:31:42.630 --> 02:31:42.640 align:start position:0%
correct and the bill is introduced there
 
02:31:44.389 --> 02:31:44.399 align:start position:0%
were no Appropriations and no
 
02:31:46.830 --> 02:31:46.840 align:start position:0%
authorizations for new positions um
 
02:31:48.750 --> 02:31:48.760 align:start position:0%
there are now in the bill as amended by
 
02:31:50.670 --> 02:31:50.680 align:start position:0%
the house for the HHS piece but not for
 
02:31:54.910 --> 02:31:54.920 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch um and I think
 
02:31:58.469 --> 02:31:58.479 align:start position:0%
those positions and cost estimates uh in
 
02:32:00.510 --> 02:32:00.520 align:start position:0%
the bill as passed by the house are
 
02:32:02.110 --> 02:32:02.120 align:start position:0%
different than what HHS is now
 
02:32:04.389 --> 02:32:04.399 align:start position:0%
predicting and will be different from
 
02:32:06.790 --> 02:32:06.800 align:start position:0%
what they predict in response to this
 
02:32:09.269 --> 02:32:09.279 align:start position:0%
amendment that's being worked on now so
 
02:32:10.790 --> 02:32:10.800 align:start position:0%
um so we'll get some new numbers from
 
02:32:11.870 --> 02:32:11.880 align:start position:0%
that and we'll include them in the
 
02:32:13.469 --> 02:32:13.479 align:start position:0%
fiscal analysis and likewise with the
 
02:32:13.479 --> 02:32:14.790 align:start position:0%
fiscal analysis and likewise with the
judicial

02:32:14.790 --> 02:32:14.800 align:start position:0%
judicial
 
02:32:18.269 --> 02:32:18.279 align:start position:0%
branch um as far as what should be in
 
02:32:20.030 --> 02:32:20.040 align:start position:0%
the amendment that's being developed now
 
02:32:22.790 --> 02:32:22.800 align:start position:0%
for an appropriation I don't know how
 
02:32:25.070 --> 02:32:25.080 align:start position:0%
quickly we'll have that number um I
 
02:32:26.790 --> 02:32:26.800 align:start position:0%
don't know for the time being perhaps
 
02:32:28.230 --> 02:32:28.240 align:start position:0%
you should consider including a
 
02:32:30.349 --> 02:32:30.359 align:start position:0%
placeholder um that could be with a
 
02:32:33.070 --> 02:32:33.080 align:start position:0%
number that could be added later um
 
02:32:34.630 --> 02:32:34.640 align:start position:0%
that's really up
 
02:32:37.030 --> 02:32:37.040 align:start position:0%
to how quickly the department can get me
 
02:32:37.040 --> 02:32:39.630 align:start position:0%
to how quickly the department can get me
some

02:32:39.630 --> 02:32:39.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:41.510 --> 02:32:41.520 align:start position:0%
information um I don't know that
 
02:32:44.510 --> 02:32:44.520 align:start position:0%
everybody heard uh representative
 
02:32:48.750 --> 02:32:48.760 align:start position:0%
Edwards um letting me know that we need
 
02:32:51.990 --> 02:32:52.000 align:start position:0%
to have an official Amendment drafted by
 
02:32:56.590 --> 02:32:56.600 align:start position:0%
OS by Monday yeah so that the division
 
02:32:59.910 --> 02:32:59.920 align:start position:0%
as a whole can um act upon this on this
 
02:33:02.830 --> 02:33:02.840 align:start position:0%
bill and be ready to uh go on for a
 
02:33:05.389 --> 02:33:05.399 align:start position:0%
Friday we're going to vote on Friday yes
 
02:33:09.309 --> 02:33:09.319 align:start position:0%
no later then so so I'm going to need I
 
02:33:12.230 --> 02:33:12.240 align:start position:0%
will go over to OS and have it drafted
 
02:33:15.750 --> 02:33:15.760 align:start position:0%
but I am going to need all these pieces
 
02:33:20.710 --> 02:33:20.720 align:start position:0%
from all of you okay right additional
 
02:33:23.990 --> 02:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
question oh represent PR has yes um on
 
02:33:26.150 --> 02:33:26.160 align:start position:0%
the development of a file management
 
02:33:28.429 --> 02:33:28.439 align:start position:0%
system for
 
02:33:31.030 --> 02:33:31.040 align:start position:0%
$500,000 that seems awfully high and I
 
02:33:32.190 --> 02:33:32.200 align:start position:0%
would just like to get some
 
02:33:37.510 --> 02:33:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:44.230 --> 02:33:44.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:46.670 --> 02:33:46.680 align:start position:0%
done in the
 
02:33:49.070 --> 02:33:49.080 align:start position:0%
um apologize Nathan white Chief
 
02:33:50.230 --> 02:33:50.240 align:start position:0%
Financial Officer Department of Health
 
02:33:53.150 --> 02:33:53.160 align:start position:0%
and Human Services um representative
 
02:33:55.469 --> 02:33:55.479 align:start position:0%
priest um you're you're looking at the
 
02:33:58.510 --> 02:33:58.520 align:start position:0%
original fiscal note the IT team has
 
02:34:00.990 --> 02:34:01.000 align:start position:0%
actually gone back and and further
 
02:34:03.110 --> 02:34:03.120 align:start position:0%
investigated that and right now they are
 
02:34:04.670 --> 02:34:04.680 align:start position:0%
estimating that that's going to be a
 
02:34:07.269 --> 02:34:07.279 align:start position:0%
higher cost
 
02:34:10.750 --> 02:34:10.760 align:start position:0%
um correct because either it would be an
 
02:34:13.750 --> 02:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
inhouse um customization or it would
 
02:34:16.110 --> 02:34:16.120 align:start position:0%
potentially be an off-the-shelf
 
02:34:19.429 --> 02:34:19.439 align:start position:0%
product but I can have uh Dave weers
 
02:34:21.230 --> 02:34:21.240 align:start position:0%
come out out to the next working session
 
02:34:23.030 --> 02:34:23.040 align:start position:0%
he's Our IT director to speak to the
 
02:34:25.030 --> 02:34:25.040 align:start position:0%
specifics of why those costs would be so
 
02:34:28.670 --> 02:34:28.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:31.950 --> 02:34:31.960 align:start position:0%
like do you have a estimate um Mr White
 
02:34:35.950 --> 02:34:35.960 align:start position:0%
of what those costs would be the most
 
02:34:37.590 --> 02:34:37.600 align:start position:0%
recent estimate I've received from Dave
 
02:34:40.190 --> 02:34:40.200 align:start position:0%
is is approximately a million
 
02:34:43.990 --> 02:34:44.000 align:start position:0%
dollars the other alternative is to
 
02:34:46.230 --> 02:34:46.240 align:start position:0%
continue to use more of a Windows folder
 
02:34:49.670 --> 02:34:49.680 align:start position:0%
based system um the the cost repres
 
02:34:52.670 --> 02:34:52.680 align:start position:0%
presented there would be to develop a a
 
02:34:56.110 --> 02:34:56.120 align:start position:0%
true uh certification system um because
 
02:34:57.429 --> 02:34:57.439 align:start position:0%
I think what's important to remember
 
02:34:59.190 --> 02:34:59.200 align:start position:0%
here is we're basically taking on almost
 
02:35:00.830 --> 02:35:00.840 align:start position:0%
like a joint commission type function
 
02:35:02.190 --> 02:35:02.200 align:start position:0%
where you're going into an organization
 
02:35:05.030 --> 02:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
to certify them we don't have any
 
02:35:08.550 --> 02:35:08.560 align:start position:0%
existing it system that we could use to
 
02:35:10.710 --> 02:35:10.720 align:start position:0%
you know run numbers and case File and
 
02:35:12.150 --> 02:35:12.160 align:start position:0%
followup and all these other things it
 
02:35:14.870 --> 02:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
would have to be completely manual um
 
02:35:18.230 --> 02:35:18.240 align:start position:0%
and it' probably be a word excel access
 
02:35:20.910 --> 02:35:20.920 align:start position:0%
based system otherwise
 
02:35:24.710 --> 02:35:24.720 align:start position:0%
so so can I just say that I I I think
 
02:35:27.750 --> 02:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
what the general policy is is that we're
 
02:35:30.389 --> 02:35:30.399 align:start position:0%
possible we would rather rely on a
 
02:35:33.150 --> 02:35:33.160 align:start position:0%
vendor that has expertise in a developed
 
02:35:35.910 --> 02:35:35.920 align:start position:0%
system than to have an employee
 
02:35:38.630 --> 02:35:38.640 align:start position:0%
basically do a roll your own with
 
02:35:41.950 --> 02:35:41.960 align:start position:0%
Microsoft tools not only because that
 
02:35:45.030 --> 02:35:45.040 align:start position:0%
person's not a subject matter expert and
 
02:35:48.469 --> 02:35:48.479 align:start position:0%
has a steep learning curve but because
 
02:35:51.150 --> 02:35:51.160 align:start position:0%
uh then we be become obligated for every
 
02:35:54.190 --> 02:35:54.200 align:start position:0%
Microsoft update and if that smart
 
02:35:56.990 --> 02:35:57.000 align:start position:0%
person goes and gets another job then we
 
02:36:00.269 --> 02:36:00.279 align:start position:0%
don't know what's in the system and we
 
02:36:04.150 --> 02:36:04.160 align:start position:0%
can't maintain it so so the I think the
 
02:36:07.710 --> 02:36:07.720 align:start position:0%
cost i' I'd be most interested in is uh
 
02:36:09.429 --> 02:36:09.439 align:start position:0%
and this is for you to representative
 
02:36:12.750 --> 02:36:12.760 align:start position:0%
priest i' I'd be most interested in what
 
02:36:16.150 --> 02:36:16.160 align:start position:0%
uh the estimate would be to procure uh
 
02:36:18.429 --> 02:36:18.439 align:start position:0%
an off-the-shelf product with a vendor
 
02:36:20.990 --> 02:36:21.000 align:start position:0%
support than to roll our
 
02:36:23.389 --> 02:36:23.399 align:start position:0%
own and and and and that's the updated
 
02:36:25.429 --> 02:36:25.439 align:start position:0%
million dollars um that we've submitted
 
02:36:27.389 --> 02:36:27.399 align:start position:0%
in the fiscal note worksheet for the
 
02:36:27.399 --> 02:36:32.910 align:start position:0%
in the fiscal note worksheet for the
amended

02:36:32.910 --> 02:36:32.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:35.790 --> 02:36:35.800 align:start position:0%
version I I block Kevin because Kevin
 
02:36:38.630 --> 02:36:38.640 align:start position:0%
had something he wanted to
 
02:36:41.710 --> 02:36:41.720 align:start position:0%
say so just as a followup what have you
 
02:36:45.830 --> 02:36:45.840 align:start position:0%
been using now in the current system
 
02:36:47.910 --> 02:36:47.920 align:start position:0%
because this you're supposed to be doing
 
02:36:50.990 --> 02:36:51.000 align:start position:0%
this already and how are you sharing
 
02:36:55.110 --> 02:36:55.120 align:start position:0%
this information and and inputting
 
02:36:59.469 --> 02:36:59.479 align:start position:0%
it is this a question for DHS J
 
02:37:02.670 --> 02:37:02.680 align:start position:0%
yes we're gonna have a question for you
 
02:37:04.550 --> 02:37:04.560 align:start position:0%
oh no I'm about to shortly be towed are
 
02:37:06.110 --> 02:37:06.120 align:start position:0%
you sure I can't
 
02:37:10.030 --> 02:37:10.040 align:start position:0%
uh take that question by writing no okay
 
02:37:12.590 --> 02:37:12.600 align:start position:0%
I'll say I'll try to be quick so we do
 
02:37:14.349 --> 02:37:14.359 align:start position:0%
everything manually now they're all in
 
02:37:17.070 --> 02:37:17.080 align:start position:0%
our shared Windows File
 
02:37:19.230 --> 02:37:19.240 align:start position:0%
Explorer separate folders one of the
 
02:37:21.670 --> 02:37:21.680 align:start position:0%
reason reasons why it is highly
 
02:37:24.750 --> 02:37:24.760 align:start position:0%
burdensome for us to get records to the
 
02:37:26.870 --> 02:37:26.880 align:start position:0%
OCA and others are who are interested is
 
02:37:30.429 --> 02:37:30.439 align:start position:0%
it's a manual process um we are swimming
 
02:37:34.510 --> 02:37:34.520 align:start position:0%
in different Excel spreadsheets that um
 
02:37:36.230 --> 02:37:36.240 align:start position:0%
the data doesn't match so it's really
 
02:37:38.349 --> 02:37:38.359 align:start position:0%
hard for us to put that together to get
 
02:37:41.590 --> 02:37:41.600 align:start position:0%
aggregate data we have providers sending
 
02:37:44.510 --> 02:37:44.520 align:start position:0%
in monthly workbook files in Excel that
 
02:37:47.309 --> 02:37:47.319 align:start position:0%
are not analyzed and aggregated either
 
02:37:49.070 --> 02:37:49.080 align:start position:0%
so we have a whole bunch of manual
 
02:37:49.080 --> 02:37:50.230 align:start position:0%
so we have a whole bunch of manual
places

02:37:50.230 --> 02:37:50.240 align:start position:0%
places
 
02:37:51.950 --> 02:37:51.960 align:start position:0%
that really don't talk to each other and
 
02:37:54.110 --> 02:37:54.120 align:start position:0%
can't give us that big picture system
 
02:37:56.590 --> 02:37:56.600 align:start position:0%
and give us the ability to share it
 
02:37:58.830 --> 02:37:58.840 align:start position:0%
easily um and and that's what we'd need
 
02:38:00.230 --> 02:38:00.240 align:start position:0%
if we're increasing the number of visits
 
02:38:01.630 --> 02:38:01.640 align:start position:0%
the number of reports right now we get
 
02:38:03.710 --> 02:38:03.720 align:start position:0%
things by facts we scan them we put them
 
02:38:08.630 --> 02:38:08.640 align:start position:0%
in files and it's um it's very slow and
 
02:38:12.510 --> 02:38:12.520 align:start position:0%
tedious so so I would imagine that that
 
02:38:14.830 --> 02:38:14.840 align:start position:0%
creates at least three problems you know
 
02:38:17.550 --> 02:38:17.560 align:start position:0%
you you got an access control issue who
 
02:38:20.190 --> 02:38:20.200 align:start position:0%
who's going to get access to this system
 
02:38:23.750 --> 02:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
you you have audit Trail issues because
 
02:38:26.150 --> 02:38:26.160 align:start position:0%
it gets to be confusing who accessed
 
02:38:28.630 --> 02:38:28.640 align:start position:0%
what information at what point and then
 
02:38:32.070 --> 02:38:32.080 align:start position:0%
you get a sharing issue where if the OCA
 
02:38:34.590 --> 02:38:34.600 align:start position:0%
wants access to the database or the
 
02:38:37.950 --> 02:38:37.960 align:start position:0%
Judiciary does then it's much more
 
02:38:40.110 --> 02:38:40.120 align:start position:0%
difficult to arrange sharing those are
 
02:38:42.750 --> 02:38:42.760 align:start position:0%
the three problems I would guess you're
 
02:38:45.230 --> 02:38:45.240 align:start position:0%
having yeah additionally we could use
 
02:38:48.190 --> 02:38:48.200 align:start position:0%
this type of system to allow providers
 
02:38:50.630 --> 02:38:50.640 align:start position:0%
to upload certification information more
 
02:38:56.230 --> 02:38:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:00.469 --> 02:39:00.479 align:start position:0%
process just as a followup um so are is
 
02:39:02.429 --> 02:39:02.439 align:start position:0%
your presence system something that
 
02:39:06.030 --> 02:39:06.040 align:start position:0%
other departments can view and no
 
02:39:08.950 --> 02:39:08.960 align:start position:0%
so thank
 
02:39:12.230 --> 02:39:12.240 align:start position:0%
you other departments cannot access it
 
02:39:12.240 --> 02:39:13.150 align:start position:0%
you other departments cannot access it
it's

02:39:13.150 --> 02:39:13.160 align:start position:0%
it's
 
02:39:16.590 --> 02:39:16.600 align:start position:0%
it no it's all within HHS and certain
 
02:39:19.190 --> 02:39:19.200 align:start position:0%
parts of HHS like parts of DCF that need
 
02:39:20.830 --> 02:39:20.840 align:start position:0%
that information can access those
 
02:39:23.230 --> 02:39:23.240 align:start position:0%
folders but it's it's all very manual
 
02:39:25.510 --> 02:39:25.520 align:start position:0%
and individual by folder and by file
 
02:39:31.750 --> 02:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:35.630 --> 02:39:35.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:39.389 --> 02:39:39.399 align:start position:0%
other no one else wants to talk okay
 
02:39:42.190 --> 02:39:42.200 align:start position:0%
okay I I felt like I I I stopped Miss
 
02:39:44.910 --> 02:39:44.920 align:start position:0%
krian from saying something you got oh
 
02:39:46.070 --> 02:39:46.080 align:start position:0%
what I was saying is that I'm shortly
 
02:39:47.630 --> 02:39:47.640 align:start position:0%
about to be
 
02:39:51.630 --> 02:39:51.640 align:start position:0%
towed oh needs to go get out there
 
02:39:54.230 --> 02:39:54.240 align:start position:0%
before before but I will stay here and
 
02:39:55.830 --> 02:39:55.840 align:start position:0%
pay that ticket if you have any more
 
02:39:58.590 --> 02:39:58.600 align:start position:0%
questions for the judicial bre okay I
 
02:40:00.710 --> 02:40:00.720 align:start position:0%
think you should go and get your
 
02:40:03.910 --> 02:40:03.920 align:start position:0%
car I want to thank everyone for coming
 
02:40:06.190 --> 02:40:06.200 align:start position:0%
and helping us get through this and I
 
02:40:08.550 --> 02:40:08.560 align:start position:0%
guess we'll see each other again I hope
 
02:40:11.190 --> 02:40:11.200 align:start position:0%
before Monday that I will hear from you
 
02:40:11.200 --> 02:40:18.309 align:start position:0%
before Monday that I will hear from you
okay

02:40:18.309 --> 02:40:18.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:18.319 --> 02:40:48.230 align:start position:0%
 
thanks

02:40:48.230 --> 02:40:48.240 align:start position:0%
