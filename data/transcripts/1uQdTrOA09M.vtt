00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:06.440 align:start position:0%
forward because recently I have received
 
00:08:08.749 --> 00:08:08.759 align:start position:0%
many phone calls now I'm going to bring
 
00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:12.080 align:start position:0%
you to a little bit of History prior in
 
00:08:16.149 --> 00:08:16.159 align:start position:0%
2017 I introduced a bill uh on behalf of
 
00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:17.800 align:start position:0%
a couple of veterans thinking this was
 
00:08:19.469 --> 00:08:19.479 align:start position:0%
an issue in New
 
00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:23.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um the Supreme Court Justice
 
00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:25.400 align:start position:0%
in um
 
00:08:27.909 --> 00:08:27.919 align:start position:0%
their um what do you call them their
 
00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:30.520 align:start position:0%
lobbyist was that at the hearing and he
 
00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:33.200 align:start position:0%
said we don't do this in New Hampshire
 
00:08:36.389 --> 00:08:36.399 align:start position:0%
there's not a problem which I agreed
 
00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:39.320 align:start position:0%
because I myself went to a divorce I
 
00:08:42.430 --> 00:08:42.440 align:start position:0%
myself would collect disability I myself
 
00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:45.640 align:start position:0%
brought forward the federal law under
 
00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:48.790 align:start position:0%
brought forward the federal law under
im-

00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:52.389 --> 00:08:52.399 align:start position:0%
98-03 in my divorce and they did not use
 
00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:56.640 align:start position:0%
my uh disability but I also got custody
 
00:08:58.710 --> 00:08:58.720 align:start position:0%
of my child children at the time so
 
00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
there was totally different case for me
 
00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:04.040 align:start position:0%
but the I can't remember his name there
 
00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:06.920 align:start position:0%
that uh in the Judiciary Committee that
 
00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:10.240 align:start position:0%
said that the courts were not doing this
 
00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:12.560 align:start position:0%
and then all of a sudden within the last
 
00:09:15.949 --> 00:09:15.959 align:start position:0%
what just prior to me filing the late
 
00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:19.000 align:start position:0%
entry of this legislation was I was
 
00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:20.440 align:start position:0%
started getting phone calls from
 
00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:21.710 align:start position:0%
started getting phone calls from
veterans

00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:21.720 align:start position:0%
veterans
 
00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:24.360 align:start position:0%
homeless okay our veterans with issues
 
00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:27.720 align:start position:0%
there that they were using the
 
00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:29.790 align:start position:0%
there that they were using the
disability

00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:29.800 align:start position:0%
disability
 
00:09:34.389 --> 00:09:34.399 align:start position:0%
for child support or for alimony now I
 
00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:38.120 align:start position:0%
want to please make this important
 
00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:40.880 align:start position:0%
veterans do not want to get away from
 
00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:43.000 align:start position:0%
paying child support that's not the
 
00:09:46.069 --> 00:09:46.079 align:start position:0%
problem that they pay child support uh
 
00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:48.640 align:start position:0%
they you know make sure you know many of
 
00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:50.560 align:start position:0%
them we might have a one or two I don't
 
00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:53.480 align:start position:0%
know but for the most part we you know
 
00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:55.200 align:start position:0%
like to take care of our
 
00:09:58.630 --> 00:09:58.640 align:start position:0%
responsibilities but in this case here
 
00:10:03.069 --> 00:10:03.079 align:start position:0%
the veterans money the judges were not
 
00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
going in accordance with the IM
 
00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:10.120 align:start position:0%
98-03 and I sent you all a copy of this
 
00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
here which goes into the apportionment
 
00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:14.910 align:start position:0%
here which goes into the apportionment
special

00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:14.920 align:start position:0%
special
 
00:10:17.470 --> 00:10:17.480 align:start position:0%
apportionment okay where it talks about
 
00:10:20.269 --> 00:10:20.279 align:start position:0%
how the garisman to arrange for a
 
00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:23.560 align:start position:0%
garnishment you know for child support
 
00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:26.320 align:start position:0%
must go or should go to the
 
00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:28.920 align:start position:0%
VA we have some judges have been
 
00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:30.640 align:start position:0%
deciding writing that they don't need to
 
00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:33.480 align:start position:0%
do this the Supreme Court there was a
 
00:10:36.829 --> 00:10:36.839 align:start position:0%
case that went forward just recently
 
00:10:39.509 --> 00:10:39.519 align:start position:0%
which the Supreme Court did not use the
 
00:10:39.519 --> 00:10:41.389 align:start position:0%
which the Supreme Court did not use the
IM

00:10:41.389 --> 00:10:41.399 align:start position:0%
IM
 
00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:46.240 align:start position:0%
98-03 and Shan brunstein will testify on
 
00:10:48.269 --> 00:10:48.279 align:start position:0%
what happened in that Supreme Court
 
00:10:48.279 --> 00:10:50.069 align:start position:0%
what happened in that Supreme Court
decision

00:10:50.069 --> 00:10:50.079 align:start position:0%
decision
 
00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:52.880 align:start position:0%
now the information that I submitted to
 
00:10:56.069 --> 00:10:56.079 align:start position:0%
you was on different veterans that you
 
00:10:57.470 --> 00:10:57.480 align:start position:0%
you're going to be able to see what's
 
00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:00.440 align:start position:0%
going on this is called in homelessness
 
00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
here and pro possibly suicide within the
 
00:11:06.269 --> 00:11:06.279 align:start position:0%
veteran Community okay because when you
 
00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:08.440 align:start position:0%
take away El this everything they
 
00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:11.480 align:start position:0%
make now you got problems because some
 
00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:13.560 align:start position:0%
of these veterans have issues mental
 
00:11:18.389 --> 00:11:18.399 align:start position:0%
issue pts issue PTSD issues um and like
 
00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:21.000 align:start position:0%
I said it's causing a huge problem
 
00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:23.880 align:start position:0%
within the veterans community the VA has
 
00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:26.440 align:start position:0%
identified this throughout the country
 
00:11:28.990 --> 00:11:29.000 align:start position:0%
and this is why you know they came out
 
00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.150 align:start position:0%
and this is why you know they came out
of

00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:30.160 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:11:33.069 --> 00:11:33.079 align:start position:0%
1998 uh which was published there by the
 
00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
uh for the IM
 
00:11:39.069 --> 00:11:39.079 align:start position:0%
98-03 to correct this problem okay uh to
 
00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:42.880 align:start position:0%
their rules and laws um but if you read
 
00:11:46.990 --> 00:11:47.000 align:start position:0%
it there's a process where the children
 
00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
can get you know support but it must go
 
00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:52.480 align:start position:0%
to the VA for them to make the decision
 
00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:54.880 align:start position:0%
now why did they do that because when
 
00:11:58.430 --> 00:11:58.440 align:start position:0%
you get disability you're 100% there's a
 
00:11:59.829 --> 00:11:59.839 align:start position:0%
certain amount of Mone money that you
 
00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:03.320 align:start position:0%
get extra because you have children and
 
00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:06.320 align:start position:0%
I agree 100% that that money belongs to
 
00:12:09.629 --> 00:12:09.639 align:start position:0%
the children to take care of the kids
 
00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
not one veteran should be excused from
 
00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:14.720 align:start position:0%
supporting their children and I don't
 
00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
know any veteran that don't not don't
 
00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:18.440 align:start position:0%
support their children because the many
 
00:12:20.949 --> 00:12:20.959 align:start position:0%
that I talk to you know are involved in
 
00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:23.000 align:start position:0%
their children's life but some of them
 
00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:26.920 align:start position:0%
been pushed away for financial
 
00:12:30.389 --> 00:12:30.399 align:start position:0%
reasons um
 
00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:32.360 align:start position:0%
if you look under the child support law
 
00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
and we added this into the bill to make
 
00:12:38.509 --> 00:12:38.519 align:start position:0%
a change under the section c i put in we
 
00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:42.760 align:start position:0%
put in the law the the uh federal law
 
00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:44.360 align:start position:0%
okay that you know New Hampshire should
 
00:12:47.269 --> 00:12:47.279 align:start position:0%
be complying with my understanding of
 
00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:50.800 align:start position:0%
the courts is our law was silent on this
 
00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:54.600 align:start position:0%
here and the judges could do this this
 
00:12:56.670 --> 00:12:56.680 align:start position:0%
is why we're pushing because not all
 
00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:00.120 align:start position:0%
veterans know the federal law like I do
 
00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
when I went to court and brought it to
 
00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:04.120 align:start position:0%
the judge and I thought the judge was
 
00:13:06.189 --> 00:13:06.199 align:start position:0%
very Prof did a great job and he
 
00:13:08.389 --> 00:13:08.399 align:start position:0%
complied with the federal law because
 
00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
there was nothing really in state
 
00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:15.760 align:start position:0%
law okay the formula needs to be fixed
 
00:13:18.069 --> 00:13:18.079 align:start position:0%
on this here because this disability
 
00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
like myself I probably spend $2 $300
 
00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:24.920 align:start position:0%
more a month on over the count of
 
00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:28.040 align:start position:0%
medication that I need that I'm required
 
00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:30.160 align:start position:0%
you know to get that the VA don't issue
 
00:13:33.269 --> 00:13:33.279 align:start position:0%
me that I purchase from s you know for
 
00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:35.480 align:start position:0%
chess and other things I won't get into
 
00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
that but and I can see other veterans
 
00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:40.240 align:start position:0%
probably having the same issues that I
 
00:13:43.829 --> 00:13:43.839 align:start position:0%
have that that need to this extra money
 
00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:46.160 align:start position:0%
but when you take away a lot of their
 
00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:49.160 align:start position:0%
money and you add in their dollars into
 
00:13:52.189 --> 00:13:52.199 align:start position:0%
the formula the ones who make out on
 
00:13:56.030 --> 00:13:56.040 align:start position:0%
this here is the courts because under
 
00:13:59.150 --> 00:13:59.160 align:start position:0%
title 4D when they collect money to the
 
00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:02.680 align:start position:0%
courts the federal kicks in money okay
 
00:14:05.389 --> 00:14:05.399 align:start position:0%
to this so when you look at the bill uh
 
00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:06.800 align:start position:0%
and I don't have it in front of me as
 
00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
far as the fiscal note but I heard
 
00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:11.880 align:start position:0%
there's a heavy fiscal note what that is
 
00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:13.360 align:start position:0%
is the Court's not going to get that
 
00:14:15.189 --> 00:14:15.199 align:start position:0%
money from the federal government
 
00:14:17.189 --> 00:14:17.199 align:start position:0%
because they're not taking advantage and
 
00:14:19.749 --> 00:14:19.759 align:start position:0%
collecting the money from the veterans
 
00:14:21.749 --> 00:14:21.759 align:start position:0%
okay they're not adding in their
 
00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
disability so this is something that we
 
00:14:26.629 --> 00:14:26.639 align:start position:0%
need to look at and make sure and push
 
00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:29.320 align:start position:0%
that aside and say the court should be
 
00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:31.600 align:start position:0%
making money off of the veterans
 
00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:34.240 align:start position:0%
disability that's being added into the
 
00:14:36.590 --> 00:14:36.600 align:start position:0%
formula now I won't go on because you're
 
00:14:38.829 --> 00:14:38.839 align:start position:0%
going to have quite a few other veterans
 
00:14:41.749 --> 00:14:41.759 align:start position:0%
they're going to testify on this here
 
00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:43.800 align:start position:0%
but in closing I want to just make sure
 
00:14:46.590 --> 00:14:46.600 align:start position:0%
that we understand the veteran Community
 
00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
is not trying to get out of being you
 
00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
know supporting their children they're
 
00:14:54.829 --> 00:14:54.839 align:start position:0%
just trying to get out of being homeless
 
00:14:56.269 --> 00:14:56.279 align:start position:0%
because they're taking a lot of that
 
00:14:58.350 --> 00:14:58.360 align:start position:0%
money away from them and they can't
 
00:15:00.269 --> 00:15:00.279 align:start position:0%
afford to live and you got some that are
 
00:15:02.749 --> 00:15:02.759 align:start position:0%
living I think in DOA or in other areas
 
00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:04.920 align:start position:0%
out of their cars here in the state of
 
00:15:07.230 --> 00:15:07.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire okay because of what's
 
00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:09.920 align:start position:0%
going on and I didn't know this until
 
00:15:12.509 --> 00:15:12.519 align:start position:0%
recently when I went and said wow this
 
00:15:14.749 --> 00:15:14.759 align:start position:0%
is something that needs to be brought
 
00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:18.320 align:start position:0%
forward you know that we fix and every
 
00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:20.880 align:start position:0%
legislation that I put forward to is
 
00:15:23.629 --> 00:15:23.639 align:start position:0%
normally nonpartisan my good friend
 
00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
representative Linda massam Miller was
 
00:15:28.069 --> 00:15:28.079 align:start position:0%
supposed to be on this here but because
 
00:15:29.829 --> 00:15:29.839 align:start position:0%
of the quickness and then what happened
 
00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:32.000 align:start position:0%
with the virus she never got a chance to
 
00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
sign on okay so I wanted to make this a
 
00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan bill which like every other
 
00:15:40.389 --> 00:15:40.399 align:start position:0%
bill I submitted throughout my 14 years
 
00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:41.880 align:start position:0%
I've always put Democrats and
 
00:15:44.590 --> 00:15:44.600 align:start position:0%
Republicans on the bill but that's the
 
00:15:46.269 --> 00:15:46.279 align:start position:0%
reason why there's only a couple of
 
00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:48.680 align:start position:0%
sponsors on there and that's all I have
 
00:15:59.990 --> 00:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:00.949 --> 00:16:00.959 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:16:03.749 --> 00:16:03.759 align:start position:0%

00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:06.480 align:start position:0%

00:16:15.389 --> 00:16:15.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:19.870 --> 00:16:19.880 align:start position:0%
horn I Christina are you controlling the
 
00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:23.160 align:start position:0%
mute yes and sometimes I it's you
 
00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:25.160 align:start position:0%

representative horn thank you for your
 
00:16:29.509 --> 00:16:29.519 align:start position:0%
testimony representative baldasaro
 
00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:31.560 align:start position:0%
um I just have a a
 
00:16:35.269 --> 00:16:35.279 align:start position:0%
question how are these veterans not
 
00:16:38.189 --> 00:16:38.199 align:start position:0%
employed who are seeking to support
 
00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:41.880 align:start position:0%
their children uh could you expand on
 
00:16:43.150 --> 00:16:43.160 align:start position:0%
what's preventing these veterans from
 
00:16:45.829 --> 00:16:45.839 align:start position:0%
getting gainful employment well you have
 
00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:48.920 align:start position:0%
some that are 100% disabled uh even
 
00:16:51.829 --> 00:16:51.839 align:start position:0%
though some of the 100% do work and that
 
00:16:53.710 --> 00:16:53.720 align:start position:0%
money is included it's not that they're
 
00:16:56.470 --> 00:16:56.480 align:start position:0%
not support them okay but you have some
 
00:16:59.069 --> 00:16:59.079 align:start position:0%
that can't work some would you know on
 
00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
mental issues they're involved with the
 
00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:03.720 align:start position:0%
vet center involved in and out of the
 
00:17:06.390 --> 00:17:06.400 align:start position:0%
VA I mean you got to I mean I you I can
 
00:17:09.309 --> 00:17:09.319 align:start position:0%
only use me like an example every six
 
00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:11.240 align:start position:0%
months I go into the VA and get blood
 
00:17:13.829 --> 00:17:13.839 align:start position:0%
every I every other couple of months I
 
00:17:16.110 --> 00:17:16.120 align:start position:0%
go get a sh my spine you know what I
 
00:17:17.949 --> 00:17:17.959 align:start position:0%
mean so on different medical issues that
 
00:17:21.309 --> 00:17:21.319 align:start position:0%
I have so I can imagine a veteran with
 
00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
PTSD you know it's hard for them to hold
 
00:17:27.429 --> 00:17:27.439 align:start position:0%
a job but they do get the you know some
 
00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
on their retirement the ones that were
 
00:17:32.549 --> 00:17:32.559 align:start position:0%
put out get a not only a ba disability
 
00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:34.280 align:start position:0%
but they also get a
 
00:17:36.590 --> 00:17:36.600 align:start position:0%
retirement so followup representative
 
00:17:40.029 --> 00:17:40.039 align:start position:0%
horn thank you Mr chairman
 
00:17:43.029 --> 00:17:43.039 align:start position:0%
so when these
 
00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:45.760 align:start position:0%
veterans uh made the decision to have
 
00:17:47.909 --> 00:17:47.919 align:start position:0%
kids and bring kids into the world they
 
00:17:50.390 --> 00:17:50.400 align:start position:0%
may not have had these disabilities and
 
00:17:53.789 --> 00:17:53.799 align:start position:0%
since having had the children they
 
00:17:57.029 --> 00:17:57.039 align:start position:0%
suffered uh an injury or qualifier
 
00:17:59.710 --> 00:17:59.720 align:start position:0%
disability after the child's been born
 
00:18:01.230 --> 00:18:01.240 align:start position:0%
this isn't a decision to neglect their
 
00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:03.760 align:start position:0%
child it's a decision influenced by the
 
00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
injuries they're sustained you know
 
00:18:06.909 --> 00:18:06.919 align:start position:0%
that's a great question here
 
00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
representative I appreciate that because
 
00:18:11.310 --> 00:18:11.320 align:start position:0%
you're right nobody I went into the
 
00:18:13.630 --> 00:18:13.640 align:start position:0%
morning cor healthy never did it in a
 
00:18:15.549 --> 00:18:15.559 align:start position:0%
million years that I expect to have
 
00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:17.840 align:start position:0%
gallbladder out kit you know and all
 
00:18:20.669 --> 00:18:20.679 align:start position:0%
this two bits of cancer and from you
 
00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:22.720 align:start position:0%
know and medication issues and other
 
00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:24.840 align:start position:0%
stuff so yeah this happens for their
 
00:18:28.310 --> 00:18:28.320 align:start position:0%
service in the military and throughout
 
00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:29.400 align:start position:0%
the years
 
00:18:32.110 --> 00:18:32.120 align:start position:0%
you know it gets worse you know on on
 
00:18:34.710 --> 00:18:34.720 align:start position:0%
the veterans and it's a shame you know I
 
00:18:37.190 --> 00:18:37.200 align:start position:0%
think we owe it to make damn well sure
 
00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:39.080 align:start position:0%
that not one veteran is Left Behind in
 
00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:41.200 align:start position:0%
this state of New Hampshire at the same
 
00:18:44.909 --> 00:18:44.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:51.149 --> 00:18:51.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
Baran thank you uh thank you
 
00:18:56.310 --> 00:18:56.320 align:start position:0%
representative baldasaro uh for bringing
 
00:18:59.870 --> 00:18:59.880 align:start position:0%
this to our attention um I
 
00:19:03.190 --> 00:19:03.200 align:start position:0%
um the CH children family law had before
 
00:19:05.470 --> 00:19:05.480 align:start position:0%
it House Bill
 
00:19:09.070 --> 00:19:09.080 align:start position:0%
362 uh which uh has been sent for
 
00:19:12.029 --> 00:19:12.039 align:start position:0%
interim study at the present time and it
 
00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:15.480 align:start position:0%
has to do with issues related to child
 
00:19:19.990 --> 00:19:20.000 align:start position:0%
support and this was done in Rel in uh
 
00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:23.840 align:start position:0%
um uh in concert with a study done by
 
00:19:26.990 --> 00:19:27.000 align:start position:0%
UNH on child support which is required
 
00:19:29.590 --> 00:19:29.600 align:start position:0%
by law every four years years for us to
 
00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
review this so my question to you is if
 
00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:36.240 align:start position:0%
if you are you aware it's a two-part
 
00:19:38.789 --> 00:19:38.799 align:start position:0%
question are you aware of the fact that
 
00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:41.200 align:start position:0%
that there is this ongoing review at the
 
00:19:44.830 --> 00:19:44.840 align:start position:0%
present time and if so is there some
 
00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:49.320 align:start position:0%
particular urgency that we respond to
 
00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:52.760 align:start position:0%
that we vote on this particular piece of
 
00:19:57.430 --> 00:19:57.440 align:start position:0%
legislation um at in in this year uh yes
 
00:19:59.430 --> 00:19:59.440 align:start position:0%
there is and the reason is because it's
 
00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:01.600 align:start position:0%
forcing veterans to be homeless it's
 
00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
forcing you know suicide and other
 
00:20:05.549 --> 00:20:05.559 align:start position:0%
things that are going on in the state of
 
00:20:10.149 --> 00:20:10.159 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um HB 362 I'm the ranking
 
00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:12.240 align:start position:0%

I'd like to say that I'm retired
 
00:21:24.750 --> 00:21:24.760 align:start position:0%
military so I understand um what the
 
00:21:27.230 --> 00:21:27.240 align:start position:0%
representative ballero is talking about
 
00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
but a question to Mr
 
00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:31.149 align:start position:0%
but a question to Mr
representative

00:21:31.149 --> 00:21:31.159 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:34.760 align:start position:0%
baleros uh the disability money that a
 
00:21:37.390 --> 00:21:37.400 align:start position:0%
veteran receives can you explain where
 
00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:39.760 align:start position:0%
that money comes from and what and is
 
00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:42.400 align:start position:0%
that money a part of uh or a certain
 
00:21:44.750 --> 00:21:44.760 align:start position:0%
percentage of the individuals
 
00:21:49.870 --> 00:21:49.880 align:start position:0%
pay oh um the the money comes from the
 
00:21:52.590 --> 00:21:52.600 align:start position:0%
VA on there in
 
00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:55.600 align:start position:0%
the is issued on a monthly basis the
 
00:21:57.710 --> 00:21:57.720 align:start position:0%
first of the month to every uh disabled
 
00:22:01.470 --> 00:22:01.480 align:start position:0%
veteran anywhere deping if you're 10% 20
 
00:22:04.710 --> 00:22:04.720 align:start position:0%
30 all the way up to 100% so this just
 
00:22:07.990 --> 00:22:08.000 align:start position:0%
not based upon excuse me it's based on
 
00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:11.120 align:start position:0%
the service members uh rate and rank
 
00:22:14.430 --> 00:22:14.440 align:start position:0%
correct uh no the disability has nothing
 
00:22:17.269 --> 00:22:17.279 align:start position:0%
to do with rank or service uh how many
 
00:22:20.830 --> 00:22:20.840 align:start position:0%
years the retirement deals with uh Rank
 
00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:24.320 align:start position:0%
and this you know service of years the
 
00:22:26.789 --> 00:22:26.799 align:start position:0%
disabilities of total apples and oranges
 
00:22:30.310 --> 00:22:30.320 align:start position:0%
from retirement to dis disability so if
 
00:22:32.110 --> 00:22:32.120 align:start position:0%
you were injured in the military and you
 
00:22:34.789 --> 00:22:34.799 align:start position:0%
were put out of a medical discharge they
 
00:22:37.149 --> 00:22:37.159 align:start position:0%
retired you more than likely okay
 
00:22:39.750 --> 00:22:39.760 align:start position:0%
especially during time of war and then
 
00:22:42.669 --> 00:22:42.679 align:start position:0%
your disability is a separate fund that
 
00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:45.360 align:start position:0%
comes from the VA to help the veteran
 
00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
live and
 
00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:49.440 align:start position:0%
survive okay so
 
00:22:52.830 --> 00:22:52.840 align:start position:0%
now but correct me if follow up Mr Mr
 
00:22:55.470 --> 00:22:55.480 align:start position:0%
chairman follow sure correct me if I'm
 
00:22:59.190 --> 00:22:59.200 align:start position:0%
wrong though Al is it is it based upon
 
00:23:02.830 --> 00:23:02.840 align:start position:0%
um the individuals if if he if he's a
 
00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:04.880 align:start position:0%
master sergeant or if he's a just a
 
00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:07.760 align:start position:0%
Corporal is it the same amount of money
 
00:23:10.310 --> 00:23:10.320 align:start position:0%
disability is the same it goes by what
 
00:23:13.269 --> 00:23:13.279 align:start position:0%
your percentage is if you're 10% 20 all
 
00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:16.400 align:start position:0%
the way up to a 100 so this is dealing
 
00:23:19.350 --> 00:23:19.360 align:start position:0%
with veterans that could be 10 20% could
 
00:23:22.350 --> 00:23:22.360 align:start position:0%
be 30 all the way up to
 
00:23:25.669 --> 00:23:25.679 align:start position:0%
100% it has nothing to do with your rank
 
00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:28.000 align:start position:0%
if that's then they would double mine as
 
00:23:31.909 --> 00:23:31.919 align:start position:0%
an e with 20 you know two years in the

and thank you uh representative for
 
00:23:55.350 --> 00:23:55.360 align:start position:0%
taking my question I actually don't know
 
00:23:56.630 --> 00:23:56.640 align:start position:0%
the answer to this so maybe you can give
 
00:23:58.789 --> 00:23:58.799 align:start position:0%
me a little clarification I'm taking a
 
00:24:01.630 --> 00:24:01.640 align:start position:0%
look at Social Security Disability uh uh
 
00:24:04.590 --> 00:24:04.600 align:start position:0%
payments and uh that those are garnished
 
00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:07.440 align:start position:0%
for child support uh what would be the
 
00:24:09.630 --> 00:24:09.640 align:start position:0%
difference in this regard uh concerning
 
00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:12.600 align:start position:0%
veterans disability the difference here
 
00:24:16.029 --> 00:24:16.039 align:start position:0%
is on the veterans disability is first
 
00:24:18.110 --> 00:24:18.120 align:start position:0%
of all a veteran that's getting 100%
 
00:24:19.789 --> 00:24:19.799 align:start position:0%
disabled can collect Social Security
 
00:24:22.990 --> 00:24:23.000 align:start position:0%
Disability also we're not going after
 
00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:26.640 align:start position:0%
that that money should be in there you
 
00:24:28.470 --> 00:24:28.480 align:start position:0%
know even though it's not a marital
 
00:24:31.830 --> 00:24:31.840 align:start position:0%
asset by the law it is a part of use for
 
00:24:34.870 --> 00:24:34.880 align:start position:0%
child support we're not touching that
 
00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:38.240 align:start position:0%
the veteran disability is designed a
 
00:24:40.549 --> 00:24:40.559 align:start position:0%
veteran to be able to live and be able
 
00:24:42.389 --> 00:24:42.399 align:start position:0%
to pay for any other stuff their
 
00:24:44.710 --> 00:24:44.720 align:start position:0%
medication above and beyond that you use
 
00:24:48.110 --> 00:24:48.120 align:start position:0%
like me you know I mean uh so there's a
 
00:24:49.909 --> 00:24:49.919 align:start position:0%
big difference there like I said once
 
00:24:53.149 --> 00:24:53.159 align:start position:0%
again apples and oranges on this the
 
00:24:56.630 --> 00:24:56.640 align:start position:0%
federal government came out with a law
 
00:25:00.389 --> 00:25:00.399 align:start position:0%
on you know the disability for veterans
 
00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:04.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:06.720 align:start position:0%
didn't did I hope I answered your
 
00:25:09.230 --> 00:25:09.240 align:start position:0%
question and if there's anything else I
 
00:25:10.710 --> 00:25:10.720 align:start position:0%
want to thank you all for taking the
 
00:25:13.990 --> 00:25:14.000 align:start position:0%
time on hearing this very important you
 
00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:17.600 align:start position:0%
know issue facing our veterans uh in New
 
00:25:19.950 --> 00:25:19.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it looks like representative
 
00:25:22.710 --> 00:25:22.720 align:start position:0%
rice has a a
 
00:25:26.149 --> 00:25:26.159 align:start position:0%
question yeah representative rice I I
 
00:25:27.870 --> 00:25:27.880 align:start position:0%
I'm having a hard time unmuting myself
 
00:25:30.909 --> 00:25:30.919 align:start position:0%
so oh you can stay unmuted that will be
 
00:25:32.830 --> 00:25:32.840 align:start position:0%
fine I got phones ringing and all that
 
00:25:34.350 --> 00:25:34.360 align:start position:0%
so I see
 
00:25:39.310 --> 00:25:39.320 align:start position:0%
sure representative rice who is
 
00:25:42.350 --> 00:25:42.360 align:start position:0%
muted okay I was
 
00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
trying um so
 
00:25:48.669 --> 00:25:48.679 align:start position:0%
representative B DeSaro
 
00:25:52.269 --> 00:25:52.279 align:start position:0%
um so this is already a federal law this
 
00:25:54.190 --> 00:25:54.200 align:start position:0%
is going to put the state in compliance
 
00:25:56.870 --> 00:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
with federal law is that correct that is
 
00:25:59.750 --> 00:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
correct and followup Mr chairman
 
00:26:03.070 --> 00:26:03.080 align:start position:0%
followup sure so by putting us in
 
00:26:04.830 --> 00:26:04.840 align:start position:0%
compliance with federal law we should
 
00:26:07.710 --> 00:26:07.720 align:start position:0%
not be hearing any more complaints from
 
00:26:11.470 --> 00:26:11.480 align:start position:0%
the um courts saying from me people who
 
00:26:13.070 --> 00:26:13.080 align:start position:0%
have been to the courts saying that this
 
00:26:16.750 --> 00:26:16.760 align:start position:0%
has happened right no you are 100% right
 
00:26:19.029 --> 00:26:19.039 align:start position:0%
this should be corrected the courts uh
 
00:26:21.669 --> 00:26:21.679 align:start position:0%
will comply with the law you know of New
 
00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you know and you know because
 
00:26:26.269 --> 00:26:26.279 align:start position:0%
if it's in federal law we should be in
 
00:26:29.190 --> 00:26:29.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire law and one more followup
 
00:26:32.190 --> 00:26:32.200 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman followup sure does it do a
 
00:26:35.470 --> 00:26:35.480 align:start position:0%
child's um a child's relationship with
 
00:26:37.830 --> 00:26:37.840 align:start position:0%
their parent any justice to have that
 
00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:38.990 align:start position:0%
their parent any justice to have that
parent

00:26:38.990 --> 00:26:39.000 align:start position:0%
parent
 
00:26:41.870 --> 00:26:41.880 align:start position:0%
homeless because we are taking any of
 
00:26:44.110 --> 00:26:44.120 align:start position:0%
their in what little income they may
 
00:26:48.149 --> 00:26:48.159 align:start position:0%
have to um live with well you know
 
00:26:49.710 --> 00:26:49.720 align:start position:0%
that's a good great question there
 
00:26:52.630 --> 00:26:52.640 align:start position:0%
because you you push it pushes the vet
 
00:26:54.269 --> 00:26:54.279 align:start position:0%
away that they've got to you know
 
00:26:55.990 --> 00:26:56.000 align:start position:0%
they're out in the street or they're you
 
00:26:57.789 --> 00:26:57.799 align:start position:0%
know doing everything they can to
 
00:26:59.470 --> 00:26:59.480 align:start position:0%
survive they don't want their children
 
00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:01.840 align:start position:0%
to see them like that I mean I know some
 
00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:04.240 align:start position:0%
homeless veterans there that are hurting
 
00:27:07.230 --> 00:27:07.240 align:start position:0%
and they don't you know they don't even
 
00:27:08.789 --> 00:27:08.799 align:start position:0%
go around their children because of the
 
00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:10.720 align:start position:0%
fact of they can't afford to get their
 
00:27:13.070 --> 00:27:13.080 align:start position:0%
own apartment or there's not enough bed
 
00:27:14.990 --> 00:27:15.000 align:start position:0%
space in the state of New Hampshire for
 
00:27:17.110 --> 00:27:17.120 align:start position:0%
the homeless veterans but then again we
 
00:27:19.310 --> 00:27:19.320 align:start position:0%
have some that don't want to come out of
 
00:27:21.630 --> 00:27:21.640 align:start position:0%
the woods because we do count every year
 
00:27:24.590 --> 00:27:24.600 align:start position:0%
you know so I I just think you know New
 
00:27:26.870 --> 00:27:26.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire should be where we don't leave
 
00:27:29.789 --> 00:27:29.799 align:start position:0%
one veteran behind and we have a large
 
00:27:32.149 --> 00:27:32.159 align:start position:0%
large population here in the state of
 
00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:35.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire of veterans about 110
 
00:27:39.710 --> 00:27:39.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:41.230 align:start position:0%
 
State

00:27:41.230 --> 00:27:41.240 align:start position:0%
State
 
00:27:47.269 --> 00:27:47.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:50.590 --> 00:27:50.600 align:start position:0%
yulla yes thank you chair Mr chairman
 
00:27:52.830 --> 00:27:52.840 align:start position:0%
thank you uh for taking my question my
 
00:27:57.190 --> 00:27:57.200 align:start position:0%
question is regarding uh the constit the
 
00:27:59.470 --> 00:27:59.480 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court
 
00:28:01.990 --> 00:28:02.000 align:start position:0%
uh judgment earlier this year saying
 
00:28:05.269 --> 00:28:05.279 align:start position:0%
that um our current law is not in
 
00:28:09.029 --> 00:28:09.039 align:start position:0%
conflict with the federal law and
 
00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
how um you see that there's maybe more
 
00:28:15.070 --> 00:28:15.080 align:start position:0%
information that the that the Supreme
 
00:28:17.950 --> 00:28:17.960 align:start position:0%
Court didn't look at or if you have that
 
00:28:19.549 --> 00:28:19.559 align:start position:0%
information or you know of someone
 
00:28:22.509 --> 00:28:22.519 align:start position:0%
that's going to testify regarding that
 
00:28:23.990 --> 00:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
issue in the
 
00:28:27.630 --> 00:28:27.640 align:start position:0%
future um yes I I sent you the what the
 
00:28:29.190 --> 00:28:29.200 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court Court didn't look at under
 
00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:31.760 align:start position:0%
the im-
 
00:28:34.350 --> 00:28:34.360 align:start position:0%
98-03 okay in the Supreme Court you know
 
00:28:36.470 --> 00:28:36.480 align:start position:0%
I'm I got the utmost confidence in our
 
00:28:38.549 --> 00:28:38.559 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court on what they do but I
 
00:28:41.230 --> 00:28:41.240 align:start position:0%
think they was failed to utilize the
 
00:28:44.190 --> 00:28:44.200 align:start position:0%
federal law in their decision and I do
 
00:28:46.149 --> 00:28:46.159 align:start position:0%
have Sean brunstein who will be
 
00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:48.720 align:start position:0%
testifying who is the case and he he
 
00:28:52.710 --> 00:28:52.720 align:start position:0%
will bring that up along with other
 
00:28:57.149 --> 00:28:57.159 align:start position:0%
veterans okay thank you okay uh yeah one
 
00:28:58.789 --> 00:28:58.799 align:start position:0%

hi thank you um Mr chair and thank you
 
00:31:06.789 --> 00:31:06.799 align:start position:0%
for taking my question representative
 
00:31:09.789 --> 00:31:09.799 align:start position:0%
baldasaro in listening to the discussion
 
00:31:13.350 --> 00:31:13.360 align:start position:0%
we talked about or you talked about um
 
00:31:16.549 --> 00:31:16.559 align:start position:0%
veterans who are in
 
00:31:19.190 --> 00:31:19.200 align:start position:0%
shelters um which quite frankly I think
 
00:31:22.190 --> 00:31:22.200 align:start position:0%
is a shame um do you think that if this
 
00:31:25.870 --> 00:31:25.880 align:start position:0%
bill were to pass it would free up some
 
00:31:29.070 --> 00:31:29.080 align:start position:0%
of the income for those
 
00:31:31.990 --> 00:31:32.000 align:start position:0%
and give them the opportunity to join in
 
00:31:35.230 --> 00:31:35.240 align:start position:0%
on some of the other
 
00:31:38.470 --> 00:31:38.480 align:start position:0%
um like uh some of the other things like
 
00:31:41.029 --> 00:31:41.039 align:start position:0%
uh representative long spoke about so
 
00:31:42.950 --> 00:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
they could get their own apartment I
 
00:31:46.590 --> 00:31:46.600 align:start position:0%
can't imagine a a veteran who is a proud
 
00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:49.760 align:start position:0%
man or woman having to have their child
 
00:31:52.990 --> 00:31:53.000 align:start position:0%
come to a homeless shelter to visit them
 
00:31:54.950 --> 00:31:54.960 align:start position:0%
I just can't imagine what that would do
 
00:31:58.310 --> 00:31:58.320 align:start position:0%
to their psychiatric
 
00:31:58.320 --> 00:31:59.629 align:start position:0%
to their psychiatric
uh

00:31:59.629 --> 00:31:59.639 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:32:03.430 --> 00:32:03.440 align:start position:0%
Health you know agree with you 100% it's
 
00:32:05.629 --> 00:32:05.639 align:start position:0%
an embarrassment you know I mean and
 
00:32:08.350 --> 00:32:08.360 align:start position:0%
it's a mental thing on the veteran also
 
00:32:10.149 --> 00:32:10.159 align:start position:0%
you know thinking that I can't go around
 
00:32:11.750 --> 00:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
my children and them see me like this
 
00:32:14.190 --> 00:32:14.200 align:start position:0%
here right you know it's a shame that
 
00:32:16.310 --> 00:32:16.320 align:start position:0%
these guys some of these veterans serve
 
00:32:19.549 --> 00:32:19.559 align:start position:0%
two three times Iraq Afghanistan you
 
00:32:22.430 --> 00:32:22.440 align:start position:0%
know I'm a desert St veteran myself you
 
00:32:25.549 --> 00:32:25.559 align:start position:0%
know and um you know it's it's a mental
 
00:32:28.470 --> 00:32:28.480 align:start position:0%
thing there when you you know you in
 
00:32:30.830 --> 00:32:30.840 align:start position:0%
these positions here because you went in
 
00:32:33.350 --> 00:32:33.360 align:start position:0%
the military successful you went in the
 
00:32:36.110 --> 00:32:36.120 align:start position:0%
military to die for your country and to
 
00:32:38.389 --> 00:32:38.399 align:start position:0%
come home and see that you're not
 
00:32:42.230 --> 00:32:42.240 align:start position:0%
getting the support is is a shame but I
 
00:32:43.750 --> 00:32:43.760 align:start position:0%
can't remember who brought up the Social
 
00:32:45.710 --> 00:32:45.720 align:start position:0%
Security that was a great question
 
00:32:48.269 --> 00:32:48.279 align:start position:0%
because that Social Security they get if
 
00:32:49.629 --> 00:32:49.639 align:start position:0%
you're a disabled vet you're getting
 
00:32:52.029 --> 00:32:52.039 align:start position:0%
that also and they're taking that money
 
00:32:55.590 --> 00:32:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:58.470 --> 00:32:58.480 align:start position:0%
support thank you represent
 
00:33:01.629 --> 00:33:01.639 align:start position:0%
here can I have a followup you can thank
 
00:33:04.590 --> 00:33:04.600 align:start position:0%
you just just a comment representative
 
00:33:09.710 --> 00:33:09.720 align:start position:0%
baldasaro I remember um many of my dad
 
00:33:12.909 --> 00:33:12.919 align:start position:0%
who was a World War II veteran many of
 
00:33:15.590 --> 00:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
his friends lived in the city that I
 
00:33:18.909 --> 00:33:18.919 align:start position:0%
lived in in Malden Mass in h a place
 
00:33:21.230 --> 00:33:21.240 align:start position:0%
called the projects and those projects
 
00:33:25.470 --> 00:33:25.480 align:start position:0%
were built for returning veterans who
 
00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
were many of them were um disabled and
 
00:33:32.549 --> 00:33:32.559 align:start position:0%
they lived in beautiful homes with their
 
00:33:35.549 --> 00:33:35.559 align:start position:0%
families and I just think it's a shame
 
00:33:38.029 --> 00:33:38.039 align:start position:0%
that every state in the country doesn't
 
00:33:42.149 --> 00:33:42.159 align:start position:0%
do the same thing now for current coming
 
00:33:44.870 --> 00:33:44.880 align:start position:0%
current veterans who are coming home
 
00:33:47.149 --> 00:33:47.159 align:start position:0%
well you know what you just brought up I
 
00:33:49.590 --> 00:33:49.600 align:start position:0%
my father was a Korean War veteran if
 
00:33:50.710 --> 00:33:50.720 align:start position:0%
you're familiar with Cambridge
 
00:33:52.509 --> 00:33:52.519 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts I lived in rooseville
 
00:33:54.950 --> 00:33:54.960 align:start position:0%
Towers it was for veterans there was the
 
00:33:58.029 --> 00:33:58.039 align:start position:0%
projects we lived there first cup few
 
00:34:00.269 --> 00:34:00.279 align:start position:0%
years five years or whatever until my
 
00:34:02.430 --> 00:34:02.440 align:start position:0%
father was able to buy a home and we
 
00:34:05.389 --> 00:34:05.399 align:start position:0%
moved you know up the street so yeah no
 
00:34:07.389 --> 00:34:07.399 align:start position:0%
that that used to be that way of course
 
00:34:09.909 --> 00:34:09.919 align:start position:0%
those homes now have been transferred
 
00:34:12.270 --> 00:34:12.280 align:start position:0%
over to you know in low income and other
 
00:34:14.990 --> 00:34:15.000 align:start position:0%
stuff there they're no longer just
 
00:34:18.829 --> 00:34:18.839 align:start position:0%
veterans right very good and I see uh
 
00:34:18.839 --> 00:34:25.669 align:start position:0%
veterans right very good and I see uh
representative

00:34:25.669 --> 00:34:25.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:27.829 --> 00:34:27.839 align:start position:0%
Connors thank you thank you for taking
 
00:34:29.950 --> 00:34:29.960 align:start position:0%
my question representative I'm not too
 
00:34:32.950 --> 00:34:32.960 align:start position:0%
familiar with the the disability formula
 
00:34:34.990 --> 00:34:35.000 align:start position:0%
does it take into account the number of
 
00:34:36.750 --> 00:34:36.760 align:start position:0%
children that a veteran has in the
 
00:34:39.629 --> 00:34:39.639 align:start position:0%
calculation of their disability payment
 
00:34:42.270 --> 00:34:42.280 align:start position:0%
yes it does if you have one children two
 
00:34:44.470 --> 00:34:44.480 align:start position:0%
three four it adds up on how many
 
00:34:47.270 --> 00:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
children you have and that money
 
00:34:50.149 --> 00:34:50.159 align:start position:0%
rightfully the certain portion belongs
 
00:34:53.310 --> 00:34:53.320 align:start position:0%
to the children and that's why the VA uh
 
00:34:56.589 --> 00:34:56.599 align:start position:0%
came up with this law okay to make sure
 
00:35:00.069 --> 00:35:00.079 align:start position:0%
that your Worman goes to them and they
 
00:35:02.270 --> 00:35:02.280 align:start position:0%
authorize that money to go from the
 
00:35:05.950 --> 00:35:05.960 align:start position:0%
finance center right to the family okay
 
00:35:08.349 --> 00:35:08.359 align:start position:0%
that that money belongs to the children
 
00:35:10.990 --> 00:35:11.000 align:start position:0%
but now New Hampshire is going around
 
00:35:14.190 --> 00:35:14.200 align:start position:0%
the system and not using it because they
 
00:35:17.310 --> 00:35:17.320 align:start position:0%
get more money under title 4D by
 
00:35:19.589 --> 00:35:19.599 align:start position:0%
collecting it
 
00:35:22.910 --> 00:35:22.920 align:start position:0%
themselves thank you very much okay see
 
00:35:24.829 --> 00:35:24.839 align:start position:0%

00:35:51.230 --> 00:35:51.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:55.550 --> 00:35:55.560 align:start position:0%

00:36:10.069 --> 00:36:10.079 align:start position:0%
much Mr chair so um I'm uh pleased to be
 
00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:12.480 align:start position:0%
the uh pleased to be the second panelist
 
00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:15.040 align:start position:0%
on a virtual house meeting and very very
 
00:36:18.309 --> 00:36:18.319 align:start position:0%
tough act to follow I'm um I was
 
00:36:19.910 --> 00:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
represent baldasar and represented
 
00:36:21.870 --> 00:36:21.880 align:start position:0%
baldasaro is very eloquent as usual and
 
00:36:24.230 --> 00:36:24.240 align:start position:0%
I certainly uh was glad the underline
 
00:36:25.829 --> 00:36:25.839 align:start position:0%
that veterans want to support their
 
00:36:27.910 --> 00:36:27.920 align:start position:0%
children and certainly nobody believes
 
00:36:31.309 --> 00:36:31.319 align:start position:0%
otherwise I'm not a veteran myself but U
 
00:36:33.270 --> 00:36:33.280 align:start position:0%
my father is a veteran my father my
 
00:36:34.870 --> 00:36:34.880 align:start position:0%
uncle's a World War II veteran many
 
00:36:37.109 --> 00:36:37.119 align:start position:0%
other relatives are veterans including
 
00:36:39.829 --> 00:36:39.839 align:start position:0%
although he was about 140 years older
 
00:36:42.349 --> 00:36:42.359 align:start position:0%
than me General Grant The Man Who U so
 
00:36:44.030 --> 00:36:44.040 align:start position:0%
representative hardigan do do you have
 
00:36:46.670 --> 00:36:46.680 align:start position:0%
testimony with reference to house 176
 
00:36:50.069 --> 00:36:50.079 align:start position:0%
absolutely yes absolutely and um so and
 
00:36:52.230 --> 00:36:52.240 align:start position:0%
I sent in some written testimony um
 
00:36:55.309 --> 00:36:55.319 align:start position:0%
which hopefully we Reed that okay so
 
00:36:56.990 --> 00:36:57.000 align:start position:0%
child support payments for the benefit
 
00:36:58.750 --> 00:36:58.760 align:start position:0%
of the children even though they're
 
00:37:00.750 --> 00:37:00.760 align:start position:0%
typically paid by a non-custodial parent
 
00:37:02.670 --> 00:37:02.680 align:start position:0%
to custodial parent and that usually
 
00:37:04.910 --> 00:37:04.920 align:start position:0%
happens um after the relationship
 
00:37:06.430 --> 00:37:06.440 align:start position:0%
between the two partners has fallen
 
00:37:08.230 --> 00:37:08.240 align:start position:0%
apart and there's often a lot of
 
00:37:11.030 --> 00:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
resentment between the the co-parents
 
00:37:13.150 --> 00:37:13.160 align:start position:0%
and of course often the children don't
 
00:37:14.950 --> 00:37:14.960 align:start position:0%
feel good about it but anyway regardless
 
00:37:17.510 --> 00:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
of how you feel about it you're morally
 
00:37:19.390 --> 00:37:19.400 align:start position:0%
and legally obligated to look after your
 
00:37:22.069 --> 00:37:22.079 align:start position:0%
children um even if you're not in good
 
00:37:23.829 --> 00:37:23.839 align:start position:0%
terms with your ex and then I guess that
 
00:37:25.150 --> 00:37:25.160 align:start position:0%
applies even if you're a disabled
 
00:37:28.670 --> 00:37:28.680 align:start position:0%
veteran as the r baldasaro AG age
 
00:37:31.950 --> 00:37:31.960 align:start position:0%
um and um just by the way I I'm on the
 
00:37:33.550 --> 00:37:33.560 align:start position:0%
Judiciary Committee I'm speaking only
 
00:37:34.990 --> 00:37:35.000 align:start position:0%
for myself and I think I didn't formerly
 
00:37:36.990 --> 00:37:37.000 align:start position:0%
introduce myself froment Timothy Oregan
 
00:37:38.990 --> 00:37:39.000 align:start position:0%
from straford County District Six towns
 
00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:43.200 align:start position:0%
of Durham and Madbury and um they anyway
 
00:37:45.510 --> 00:37:45.520 align:start position:0%
and um actually I actually don't
 
00:37:47.230 --> 00:37:47.240 align:start position:0%
remember the Judiciary Committee hearing
 
00:37:49.750 --> 00:37:49.760 align:start position:0%
Rend baldasaro referred to although he
 
00:37:51.589 --> 00:37:51.599 align:start position:0%
is a frequent visitor to our committee
 
00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:54.240 align:start position:0%
anyway so veterans disability payments
 
00:37:55.910 --> 00:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
are not just for veterans themselves the
 
00:37:57.550 --> 00:37:57.560 align:start position:0%
veterans fam is integral part of the
 
00:38:00.829 --> 00:38:00.839 align:start position:0%
program and um if you're more than 30%
 
00:38:02.870 --> 00:38:02.880 align:start position:0%
disabled you get extra payments based if
 
00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
you have a spouse or dependent child and
 
00:38:07.990 --> 00:38:08.000 align:start position:0%
when the eligible disabled veteran dies
 
00:38:09.470 --> 00:38:09.480 align:start position:0%
their children receive payments until
 
00:38:12.750 --> 00:38:12.760 align:start position:0%
the age of 18 or 23 after till in school
 
00:38:14.990 --> 00:38:15.000 align:start position:0%
and the surviving spouse in many cases
 
00:38:16.829 --> 00:38:16.839 align:start position:0%
also is eligible for veterans I think
 
00:38:19.470 --> 00:38:19.480 align:start position:0%
sometimes even if they're divorced but
 
00:38:20.790 --> 00:38:20.800 align:start position:0%
they've been married to the veteran and
 
00:38:22.510 --> 00:38:22.520 align:start position:0%
then parents can get veterans so this is
 
00:38:24.069 --> 00:38:24.079 align:start position:0%
a program which supports the entire
 
00:38:26.349 --> 00:38:26.359 align:start position:0%
family which makes sense because one
 
00:38:28.069 --> 00:38:28.079 align:start position:0%
family member's disability affects the
 
00:38:30.750 --> 00:38:30.760 align:start position:0%
whole family so excluding the benefits
 
00:38:33.109 --> 00:38:33.119 align:start position:0%
from State child support calculations
 
00:38:34.670 --> 00:38:34.680 align:start position:0%
flies in the face of how the veterans
 
00:38:36.950 --> 00:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
disability payments program is designed
 
00:38:40.349 --> 00:38:40.359 align:start position:0%
um also as the fiscal note passes and I
 
00:38:41.710 --> 00:38:41.720 align:start position:0%
actually have the bill in the fiscal
 
00:38:42.790 --> 00:38:42.800 align:start position:0%
note in front of me and I've been
 
00:38:44.829 --> 00:38:44.839 align:start position:0%
looking at it while listening to Res
 
00:38:47.750 --> 00:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
bisaro um families will be for forced to
 
00:38:49.630 --> 00:38:49.640 align:start position:0%
seek more aid from State assistant
 
00:38:53.510 --> 00:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
programs hence for the from the uh and
 
00:38:55.630 --> 00:38:55.640 align:start position:0%
from the taxpayers it's also possible
 
00:38:57.109 --> 00:38:57.119 align:start position:0%
the state will be denied a significant
 
00:38:58.470 --> 00:38:58.480 align:start position:0%
amount of Federal funding since this
 
00:39:00.270 --> 00:39:00.280 align:start position:0%
bill is in conflict with current federal
 
00:39:04.470 --> 00:39:04.480 align:start position:0%
law um 45 CFR paragraph
 
00:39:07.109 --> 00:39:07.119 align:start position:0%
33256 states that the state of New
 
00:39:09.309 --> 00:39:09.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire child support guidelines must
 
00:39:11.109 --> 00:39:11.119 align:start position:0%
considered all earnings or income of the
 
00:39:13.309 --> 00:39:13.319 align:start position:0%
non-custodial parents so that mean
 
00:39:16.030 --> 00:39:16.040 align:start position:0%
phrase all earnings and incomes means
 
00:39:17.950 --> 00:39:17.960 align:start position:0%
all earnings and income that includes
 
00:39:20.030 --> 00:39:20.040 align:start position:0%
the veterans disability benefits even
 
00:39:22.030 --> 00:39:22.040 align:start position:0%
though they're not subject to the
 
00:39:27.750 --> 00:39:27.760 align:start position:0%
federal income tax and um so that's a so
 
00:39:30.309 --> 00:39:30.319 align:start position:0%
so I just think this bill is uh and also
 
00:39:31.950 --> 00:39:31.960 align:start position:0%
this bill is unnecessary there's no
 
00:39:33.750 --> 00:39:33.760 align:start position:0%
pressing need for it
 
00:39:36.950 --> 00:39:36.960 align:start position:0%
um even though uh well I guess I guess I
 
00:39:38.309 --> 00:39:38.319 align:start position:0%
won't make a comment about what's going
 
00:39:41.589 --> 00:39:41.599 align:start position:0%
on with the uh military possibly being
 
00:39:44.109 --> 00:39:44.119 align:start position:0%
uh used domestically but which will
 
00:39:46.309 --> 00:39:46.319 align:start position:0%
cause a lot more PTSD if that happens
 
00:39:48.910 --> 00:39:48.920 align:start position:0%
because um anyway I think this bill is
 
00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:51.200 align:start position:0%
unnecessary certainly unnecessary at
 
00:39:52.990 --> 00:39:53.000 align:start position:0%
this time and unnecessary at any time so
 
00:39:55.150 --> 00:39:55.160 align:start position:0%
I urge you to uh find it in expedient
 
00:39:57.829 --> 00:39:57.839 align:start position:0%
legisl so thanks be happy representative
 
00:39:59.390 --> 00:39:59.400 align:start position:0%

00:40:45.150 --> 00:40:45.160 align:start position:0%
one from the um speak HCS I believe
 
00:40:48.390 --> 00:40:48.400 align:start position:0%
there was one from HS uh Christina Well
 
00:40:51.150 --> 00:40:51.160 align:start position:0%
I did email it directly to you oh you to
 
00:40:53.790 --> 00:40:53.800 align:start position:0%

list we did check and did not see the
 
00:41:36.190 --> 00:41:36.200 align:start position:0%
number or a name matching that so she
 
00:41:38.550 --> 00:41:38.560 align:start position:0%

00:41:57.589 --> 00:41:57.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:00.230 --> 00:42:00.240 align:start position:0%
is is uh Nicholas
 
00:42:03.990 --> 00:42:04.000 align:start position:0%
uh I do not see Nicholas raldi okay and
 
00:42:07.349 --> 00:42:07.359 align:start position:0%
for the record uh representative fer is
 
00:42:10.510 --> 00:42:10.520 align:start position:0%
here I I did see him uh representative
 
00:42:16.390 --> 00:42:16.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:22.349 --> 00:42:22.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:25.109 --> 00:42:25.119 align:start position:0%
list and she
 
00:42:27.990 --> 00:42:28.000 align:start position:0%
comes hi can you hear me
 
00:42:31.750 --> 00:42:31.760 align:start position:0%
yes okay um my name is Mora Ryan I live
 
00:42:35.150 --> 00:42:35.160 align:start position:0%
in legendary New Hampshire um I am a
 
00:42:37.910 --> 00:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
veteran a combat veteran um and I was
 
00:42:40.349 --> 00:42:40.359 align:start position:0%
asked to speak on behalf of female
 
00:42:43.190 --> 00:42:43.200 align:start position:0%
veterans who are custodial parents um in
 
00:42:45.870 --> 00:42:45.880 align:start position:0%
reference to IM 98-03 I just wanted to
 
00:42:47.950 --> 00:42:47.960 align:start position:0%
say that's not a law or mandate the
 
00:42:51.030 --> 00:42:51.040 align:start position:0%
apportionment process was meant to buoy
 
00:42:53.670 --> 00:42:53.680 align:start position:0%
the state process because the federal
 
00:42:55.309 --> 00:42:55.319 align:start position:0%
government is not allowed to intervene
 
00:42:58.150 --> 00:42:58.160 align:start position:0%
and divorce per the supremacy clause
 
00:43:01.030 --> 00:43:01.040 align:start position:0%
um so I don't feel like this is
 
00:43:02.390 --> 00:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
something that's necessary and I also
 
00:43:03.910 --> 00:43:03.920 align:start position:0%
feel that it's detrimental to children
 
00:43:06.710 --> 00:43:06.720 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to explain why um I'm a
 
00:43:08.109 --> 00:43:08.119 align:start position:0%
single parent I have a son with
 
00:43:10.349 --> 00:43:10.359 align:start position:0%
disabilities my son has
 
00:43:13.270 --> 00:43:13.280 align:start position:0%
autism um I met my ex-husband when I was
 
00:43:14.950 --> 00:43:14.960 align:start position:0%
a Corporal and he was a sergeant in the
 
00:43:18.470 --> 00:43:18.480 align:start position:0%
Army um and he was making about $1,200 a
 
00:43:21.270 --> 00:43:21.280 align:start position:0%
month and I was making about $800 a
 
00:43:23.349 --> 00:43:23.359 align:start position:0%
month and ultimately we divorced because
 
00:43:25.069 --> 00:43:25.079 align:start position:0%
my son uh has disabilities and he
 
00:43:27.510 --> 00:43:27.520 align:start position:0%
requires quite a bit of care
 
00:43:29.069 --> 00:43:29.079 align:start position:0%
subsequently after getting out of the
 
00:43:32.309 --> 00:43:32.319 align:start position:0%
military he was rated 100% permanent in
 
00:43:34.710 --> 00:43:34.720 align:start position:0%
total and he gets a total of almost
 
00:43:36.950 --> 00:43:36.960 align:start position:0%
$4,000 from the Department of Veterans
 
00:43:40.630 --> 00:43:40.640 align:start position:0%
Affairs so with a $4,000 income he is
 
00:43:43.349 --> 00:43:43.359 align:start position:0%
able to live without working because he
 
00:43:46.109 --> 00:43:46.119 align:start position:0%
can live on $4,000 and just so you know
 
00:43:49.030 --> 00:43:49.040 align:start position:0%
if a veteran is 100% disabled they are
 
00:43:51.750 --> 00:43:51.760 align:start position:0%
going to get over $3,000 a month so if
 
00:43:53.150 --> 00:43:53.160 align:start position:0%
they are homeless I don't know where
 
00:43:54.750 --> 00:43:54.760 align:start position:0%
they're spending their money but there
 
00:43:56.549 --> 00:43:56.559 align:start position:0%
are apartments that are certainly less
 
00:44:00.069 --> 00:44:00.079 align:start position:0%
than3 $200 a month um the apportionment
 
00:44:02.750 --> 00:44:02.760 align:start position:0%
process is a very long process as I said
 
00:44:05.230 --> 00:44:05.240 align:start position:0%
it's meant to buoy the state process I
 
00:44:06.910 --> 00:44:06.920 align:start position:0%
actually filed for my apportionment with
 
00:44:08.910 --> 00:44:08.920 align:start position:0%
my ex because his VA disability is his
 
00:44:11.870 --> 00:44:11.880 align:start position:0%
sole source of income in 2011 when my
 
00:44:14.870 --> 00:44:14.880 align:start position:0%
son was seven years old my son is now 16
 
00:44:16.430 --> 00:44:16.440 align:start position:0%
and I have not received one penny of
 
00:44:18.309 --> 00:44:18.319 align:start position:0%
child support from that entire period of
 
00:44:20.589 --> 00:44:20.599 align:start position:0%
time um in addition to that he's
 
00:44:22.270 --> 00:44:22.280 align:start position:0%
required to provide health insurance for
 
00:44:24.069 --> 00:44:24.079 align:start position:0%
my son which he has not done and he gets
 
00:44:26.430 --> 00:44:26.440 align:start position:0%
champ VA which is provided to him free
 
00:44:28.710 --> 00:44:28.720 align:start position:0%
by the government
 
00:44:31.750 --> 00:44:31.760 align:start position:0%
um the state is the one that's supposed
 
00:44:34.270 --> 00:44:34.280 align:start position:0%
to drive the process for divorce so the
 
00:44:35.910 --> 00:44:35.920 align:start position:0%
state is supposed to look as
 
00:44:38.190 --> 00:44:38.200 align:start position:0%
representative Horgan said at all forms
 
00:44:40.990 --> 00:44:41.000 align:start position:0%
of income including VA disability to
 
00:44:42.670 --> 00:44:42.680 align:start position:0%
determine the proper amount of child
 
00:44:45.109 --> 00:44:45.119 align:start position:0%
support now in the state process when we
 
00:44:47.150 --> 00:44:47.160 align:start position:0%
went to court there were things like
 
00:44:50.630 --> 00:44:50.640 align:start position:0%
Discovery and discussions about um our
 
00:44:53.990 --> 00:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
finances because I am also a VA dis
 
00:44:56.670 --> 00:44:56.680 align:start position:0%
disabled veteran I'm at 90% so I get
 
00:44:59.950 --> 00:44:59.960 align:start position:0%
about $2,000 a month to support my son
 
00:45:01.870 --> 00:45:01.880 align:start position:0%
um and I can't work because I have
 
00:45:03.549 --> 00:45:03.559 align:start position:0%
migraines that induce blindness but
 
00:45:05.630 --> 00:45:05.640 align:start position:0%
that's a whole other thing um so the
 
00:45:07.470 --> 00:45:07.480 align:start position:0%
state looked our incomes and made
 
00:45:10.230 --> 00:45:10.240 align:start position:0%
decision that he was to pay me $330 a
 
00:45:13.670 --> 00:45:13.680 align:start position:0%
month based off his army um income I've
 
00:45:15.549 --> 00:45:15.559 align:start position:0%
never gotten a subsequent increase and
 
00:45:16.790 --> 00:45:16.800 align:start position:0%
I've never asked for one because I
 
00:45:18.990 --> 00:45:19.000 align:start position:0%
figured if he just gave me the $330 a
 
00:45:22.190 --> 00:45:22.200 align:start position:0%
month we could call it Square um the a
 
00:45:26.109 --> 00:45:26.119 align:start position:0%
portioning process is not favorable to
 
00:45:28.030 --> 00:45:28.040 align:start position:0%
the custodial p because they're denied
 
00:45:30.030 --> 00:45:30.040 align:start position:0%
the opportunity for Discovery they're
 
00:45:31.549 --> 00:45:31.559 align:start position:0%
not allowed to see what the other party
 
00:45:33.309 --> 00:45:33.319 align:start position:0%
submits and subsequently they're not
 
00:45:36.430 --> 00:45:36.440 align:start position:0%
able to refute any information um and
 
00:45:38.349 --> 00:45:38.359 align:start position:0%
it's it's generally not a fair process I
 
00:45:40.150 --> 00:45:40.160 align:start position:0%
mean I've been waiting almost 10 years
 
00:45:41.390 --> 00:45:41.400 align:start position:0%
just to get a hearing to get my
 
00:45:44.190 --> 00:45:44.200 align:start position:0%
apportionment heard and because ofs are
 
00:45:46.910 --> 00:45:46.920 align:start position:0%
secondary claims to VA benefits claims
 
00:45:49.630 --> 00:45:49.640 align:start position:0%
they get pushed down list further and
 
00:45:51.630 --> 00:45:51.640 align:start position:0%
further I don't know how many of you are
 
00:45:55.109 --> 00:45:55.119 align:start position:0%
familiar with Gody versus Wii it was a
 
00:45:57.750 --> 00:45:57.760 align:start position:0%
court case which was filed against the
 
00:46:00.390 --> 00:46:00.400 align:start position:0%
VA because of the long amount of time
 
00:46:02.349 --> 00:46:02.359 align:start position:0%
that veterans have to wait for claims to
 
00:46:06.510 --> 00:46:06.520 align:start position:0%
be resolved um in Gody all the cases
 
00:46:09.390 --> 00:46:09.400 align:start position:0%
that filed on behalf of those veterans
 
00:46:11.950 --> 00:46:11.960 align:start position:0%
who are filing for VA benefits got moved
 
00:46:13.750 --> 00:46:13.760 align:start position:0%
ahead of all the people who were waiting
 
00:46:17.349 --> 00:46:17.359 align:start position:0%
for their aborate cases to be heard um
 
00:46:19.150 --> 00:46:19.160 align:start position:0%
this federal government has essentially
 
00:46:21.150 --> 00:46:21.160 align:start position:0%
stated that all forms of income are
 
00:46:23.710 --> 00:46:23.720 align:start position:0%
required to supply child support and
 
00:46:27.950 --> 00:46:27.960 align:start position:0%
under 38 CFR 3501
 
00:46:29.750 --> 00:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
um child support is one of the things
 
00:46:32.630 --> 00:46:32.640 align:start position:0%
that is Exempted so in other words 38
 
00:46:34.790 --> 00:46:34.800 align:start position:0%
CFR uh five
 
00:46:37.150 --> 00:46:37.160 align:start position:0%
35531 I'm sorry I'm not quoting exactly
 
00:46:38.750 --> 00:46:38.760 align:start position:0%
and I know someone else s in the legal
 
00:46:41.230 --> 00:46:41.240 align:start position:0%
jargon and I'm not a specialist at that
 
00:46:44.710 --> 00:46:44.720 align:start position:0%
but it exempts VA benefits from ordinary
 
00:46:47.430 --> 00:46:47.440 align:start position:0%
creditors meaning bill collectors but
 
00:46:49.109 --> 00:46:49.119 align:start position:0%
because that money is supplied for the
 
00:46:51.670 --> 00:46:51.680 align:start position:0%
family it's hold into the family I mean
 
00:46:53.829 --> 00:46:53.839 align:start position:0%
we're talking about veterans who are out
 
00:46:55.790 --> 00:46:55.800 align:start position:0%
there who are not paying child support
 
00:46:59.549 --> 00:46:59.559 align:start position:0%
and leaving their female veteran partner
 
00:47:02.589 --> 00:47:02.599 align:start position:0%
at a dis disadvantage in the system now
 
00:47:03.790 --> 00:47:03.800 align:start position:0%
there are some people who say well the
 
00:47:05.430 --> 00:47:05.440 align:start position:0%
basic needs will be met because the kid
 
00:47:06.910 --> 00:47:06.920 align:start position:0%
can go on Medicaid and the kid can be on
 
00:47:09.710 --> 00:47:09.720 align:start position:0%
Wick well Wick only lasts up until age
 
00:47:12.069 --> 00:47:12.079 align:start position:0%
five what happens after that why should
 
00:47:15.910 --> 00:47:15.920 align:start position:0%
the taxpayer pay for Medicaid if if the
 
00:47:17.349 --> 00:47:17.359 align:start position:0%
dependent should be getting it through
 
00:47:20.430 --> 00:47:20.440 align:start position:0%
champ VA um why should the taxpayer have
 
00:47:22.910 --> 00:47:22.920 align:start position:0%
to pay for those things if those other
 
00:47:25.390 --> 00:47:25.400 align:start position:0%
things are in place already now in my
 
00:47:27.670 --> 00:47:27.680 align:start position:0%
case my ex is getting ch VA but he
 
00:47:30.349 --> 00:47:30.359 align:start position:0%
refuses to allow my son to be under him
 
00:47:32.670 --> 00:47:32.680 align:start position:0%
so I've paid for insurance for him I've
 
00:47:34.910 --> 00:47:34.920 align:start position:0%
paid for ortha J for him for to the tune
 
00:47:37.150 --> 00:47:37.160 align:start position:0%
of $10,000 because he's a kid who has
 
00:47:39.470 --> 00:47:39.480 align:start position:0%
disabilities I have a lot of expenses
 
00:47:42.190 --> 00:47:42.200 align:start position:0%
for him I paid for every penny of his
 
00:47:44.630 --> 00:47:44.640 align:start position:0%
insurance even though the court said
 
00:47:48.109 --> 00:47:48.119 align:start position:0%
that he was required to cover it um now
 
00:47:50.190 --> 00:47:50.200 align:start position:0%
the VA disability is his sole source of
 
00:47:52.309 --> 00:47:52.319 align:start position:0%
income he's getting almost $4,000 he can
 
00:47:55.230 --> 00:47:55.240 align:start position:0%
live off that um I've applied to child
 
00:47:56.870 --> 00:47:56.880 align:start position:0%
support enforcement through the state of
 
00:47:59.349 --> 00:47:59.359 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire roxan Bryce was my case
 
00:48:01.309 --> 00:48:01.319 align:start position:0%
worker um she knows that I've been
 
00:48:03.069 --> 00:48:03.079 align:start position:0%
trying to get the payments that
 
00:48:04.829 --> 00:48:04.839 align:start position:0%
particularly now with covid-19 I need
 
00:48:07.069 --> 00:48:07.079 align:start position:0%
them because my son requires a tutor
 
00:48:09.829 --> 00:48:09.839 align:start position:0%
with uh remote learning because he can't
 
00:48:14.270 --> 00:48:14.280 align:start position:0%
handle it um and she would not enforce
 
00:48:16.950 --> 00:48:16.960 align:start position:0%
that and the HHS I've had emails from
 
00:48:19.270 --> 00:48:19.280 align:start position:0%
them stating they would not enforce so
 
00:48:22.549 --> 00:48:22.559 align:start position:0%
I'm over rears of almost $30,000 on a
 
00:48:24.870 --> 00:48:24.880 align:start position:0%
$330 a month child
 
00:48:27.589 --> 00:48:27.599 align:start position:0%
appointment um
 
00:48:29.950 --> 00:48:29.960 align:start position:0%
my ex-husband has a farm he has a
 
00:48:32.910 --> 00:48:32.920 align:start position:0%
$40,000 truck and I don't wish ill
 
00:48:35.829 --> 00:48:35.839 align:start position:0%
against him for that I'm grateful that
 
00:48:37.630 --> 00:48:37.640 align:start position:0%
he's able to have things in the world
 
00:48:41.750 --> 00:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
and he's doing well but my son has to
 
00:48:45.230 --> 00:48:45.240 align:start position:0%
go and eat out of the free food line and
 
00:48:47.470 --> 00:48:47.480 align:start position:0%
free and reduced lunch and why should he
 
00:48:49.030 --> 00:48:49.040 align:start position:0%
have to do that because if I got that
 
00:48:51.990 --> 00:48:52.000 align:start position:0%
$330 a month I could be able to support
 
00:48:53.910 --> 00:48:53.920 align:start position:0%
him with other things if I got that
 
00:48:55.870 --> 00:48:55.880 align:start position:0%
insurance coverage for him I would be
 
00:48:58.270 --> 00:48:58.280 align:start position:0%
able to support him for other
 
00:49:00.589 --> 00:49:00.599 align:start position:0%
things um as I've stated I've been
 
00:49:03.390 --> 00:49:03.400 align:start position:0%
waiting for hearing for almost 10 years
 
00:49:06.470 --> 00:49:06.480 align:start position:0%
my hearing was scheduled for April 15 20
 
00:49:08.789 --> 00:49:08.799 align:start position:0%
uh 2020 and it was canceled because of
 
00:49:11.030 --> 00:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
covid-19 which is going to set it back
 
00:49:14.190 --> 00:49:14.200 align:start position:0%
over a year um I'm still waiting for
 
00:49:17.309 --> 00:49:17.319 align:start position:0%
resolution um as I said the
 
00:49:20.270 --> 00:49:20.280 align:start position:0%
apportionment process hinges on the
 
00:49:22.789 --> 00:49:22.799 align:start position:0%
state process including VA disability in
 
00:49:25.309 --> 00:49:25.319 align:start position:0%
it because the federal government under
 
00:49:27.270 --> 00:49:27.280 align:start position:0%
the supremacy clause cannot determine
 
00:49:30.030 --> 00:49:30.040 align:start position:0%
amounts of Child Support um because they
 
00:49:32.030 --> 00:49:32.040 align:start position:0%
can't interfere in State's rights and
 
00:49:33.870 --> 00:49:33.880 align:start position:0%
divorce and child support is considered
 
00:49:35.870 --> 00:49:35.880 align:start position:0%
state right so the way it works is under
 
00:49:38.589 --> 00:49:38.599 align:start position:0%
the apportionment claim you apply for it
 
00:49:40.349 --> 00:49:40.359 align:start position:0%
and they look at number one whether or
 
00:49:42.510 --> 00:49:42.520 align:start position:0%
not the child is is residing with the
 
00:49:44.190 --> 00:49:44.200 align:start position:0%
non-custodial parent if they're residing
 
00:49:46.230 --> 00:49:46.240 align:start position:0%
with the non-custodial parent it doesn't
 
00:49:48.670 --> 00:49:48.680 align:start position:0%
apply and number two if that person is
 
00:49:50.470 --> 00:49:50.480 align:start position:0%
reasonably discharging their duty to
 
00:49:52.750 --> 00:49:52.760 align:start position:0%
support their child they base that
 
00:49:54.390 --> 00:49:54.400 align:start position:0%
information on the court ordered child
 
00:49:57.230 --> 00:49:57.240 align:start position:0%
support So if you take this out
 
00:49:59.630 --> 00:49:59.640 align:start position:0%
then there would be no ability to
 
00:50:02.589 --> 00:50:02.599 align:start position:0%
determine if the the N uh the
 
00:50:04.190 --> 00:50:04.200 align:start position:0%
non-custodial parent were paying their
 
00:50:07.109 --> 00:50:07.119 align:start position:0%
child support because it is based on the
 
00:50:07.119 --> 00:50:08.349 align:start position:0%
child support because it is based on the
state

00:50:08.349 --> 00:50:08.359 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:50:11.349 --> 00:50:11.359 align:start position:0%
determination um the rules for the
 
00:50:13.750 --> 00:50:13.760 align:start position:0%
apportionment are very they're
 
00:50:16.190 --> 00:50:16.200 align:start position:0%
unregulated they're very subjective and
 
00:50:18.750 --> 00:50:18.760 align:start position:0%
they're not clearly defined they
 
00:50:21.470 --> 00:50:21.480 align:start position:0%
actually rely on the state to try and
 
00:50:24.270 --> 00:50:24.280 align:start position:0%
clearly Define those um I can tell you
 
00:50:26.309 --> 00:50:26.319 align:start position:0%
that my ex was able to get an attorney
 
00:50:28.870 --> 00:50:28.880 align:start position:0%
to defend him through the VFW I was told
 
00:50:30.549 --> 00:50:30.559 align:start position:0%
that I was not entitled to an attorney
 
00:50:33.910 --> 00:50:33.920 align:start position:0%
even though I'm a veteran because um I
 
00:50:35.470 --> 00:50:35.480 align:start position:0%
am the one who is filing for the
 
00:50:38.390 --> 00:50:38.400 align:start position:0%
abortion me claim
 
00:50:41.510 --> 00:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
um I just want to make clear that there
 
00:50:44.470 --> 00:50:44.480 align:start position:0%
are many other female veterans like me
 
00:50:46.549 --> 00:50:46.559 align:start position:0%
who don't get a lot to live off of who
 
00:50:49.190 --> 00:50:49.200 align:start position:0%
are not able to uh not able to get our
 
00:50:50.910 --> 00:50:50.920 align:start position:0%
child support payments because our exes
 
00:50:54.750 --> 00:50:54.760 align:start position:0%
are living off via disability um I do
 
00:50:57.870 --> 00:50:57.880 align:start position:0%
know that federal law states that if you
 
00:51:00.230 --> 00:51:00.240 align:start position:0%
exceed $5,000 in two years of child
 
00:51:02.309 --> 00:51:02.319 align:start position:0%
support payments it's a federal crime
 
00:51:05.109 --> 00:51:05.119 align:start position:0%
per uh punishable by law now my next
 
00:51:06.470 --> 00:51:06.480 align:start position:0%
step if I can't get an enforcement
 
00:51:08.109 --> 00:51:08.119 align:start position:0%
hearing is to go through that process
 
00:51:09.230 --> 00:51:09.240 align:start position:0%
but I don't want to go through that
 
00:51:10.829 --> 00:51:10.839 align:start position:0%
process because from my perspective it's
 
00:51:12.789 --> 00:51:12.799 align:start position:0%
counterproductive I don't want my ex to
 
00:51:14.750 --> 00:51:14.760 align:start position:0%
have to go to prison to make him pay
 
00:51:17.549 --> 00:51:17.559 align:start position:0%
child support it doesn't benefit me it
 
00:51:19.549 --> 00:51:19.559 align:start position:0%
doesn't benefit him all I want to get is
 
00:51:24.589 --> 00:51:24.599 align:start position:0%
the $330 a month um I mean he is
 
00:51:27.030 --> 00:51:27.040 align:start position:0%
remarried now so he's also able to live
 
00:51:29.270 --> 00:51:29.280 align:start position:0%
off his spouse's income I don't have
 
00:51:31.309 --> 00:51:31.319 align:start position:0%
another spouse I'm not able to live off
 
00:51:33.390 --> 00:51:33.400 align:start position:0%
any additional income and that income is
 
00:51:36.030 --> 00:51:36.040 align:start position:0%
not considered in my son's divorce and
 
00:51:37.270 --> 00:51:37.280 align:start position:0%
it shouldn't be because she makes her
 
00:51:39.510 --> 00:51:39.520 align:start position:0%
own money but he does have the benefit
 
00:51:41.750 --> 00:51:41.760 align:start position:0%
of that which the VA also did not
 
00:51:44.870 --> 00:51:44.880 align:start position:0%
consider um so I hope you have questions
 
00:51:47.069 --> 00:51:47.079 align:start position:0%
for me because I'm I do know this
 
00:51:49.470 --> 00:51:49.480 align:start position:0%
process very well I do know that the
 
00:51:51.549 --> 00:51:51.559 align:start position:0%
state process is fair just because due
 
00:51:53.470 --> 00:51:53.480 align:start position:0%
process is sort of observed where it's
 
00:51:56.109 --> 00:51:56.119 align:start position:0%
really not the aborate claim um I don't
 
00:51:59.870 --> 00:51:59.880 align:start position:0%
want to kids staying in poverty because
 
00:52:03.270 --> 00:52:03.280 align:start position:0%
their veteran parents can't collect
 
00:52:09.390 --> 00:52:09.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:12.910 --> 00:52:12.920 align:start position:0%
um I do know also I do know that Mr
 
00:52:15.510 --> 00:52:15.520 align:start position:0%
bronstein is probably going to testify
 
00:52:17.990 --> 00:52:18.000 align:start position:0%
that many parents are agreeable to
 
00:52:19.990 --> 00:52:20.000 align:start position:0%
co-parenting that has not been my
 
00:52:23.349 --> 00:52:23.359 align:start position:0%
experience um it is divorce is kind of a
 
00:52:25.630 --> 00:52:25.640 align:start position:0%
vicious process but children should not
 
00:52:27.230 --> 00:52:27.240 align:start position:0%
be a part of that they should be
 
00:52:29.390 --> 00:52:29.400 align:start position:0%
supported by both parents and it should
 
00:52:31.510 --> 00:52:31.520 align:start position:0%
be Equitable and you have to remember
 
00:52:32.950 --> 00:52:32.960 align:start position:0%
that if that female veteran who's
 
00:52:34.109 --> 00:52:34.119 align:start position:0%
applying for those child support
 
00:52:35.910 --> 00:52:35.920 align:start position:0%
payments if they're living on the street
 
00:52:38.670 --> 00:52:38.680 align:start position:0%
that's also not fair
 
00:52:41.190 --> 00:52:41.200 align:start position:0%
um I don't think that this should be
 
00:52:43.950 --> 00:52:43.960 align:start position:0%
supported because as I stated IM
 
00:52:47.030 --> 00:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
9803 is just a memo and it's actually a
 
00:52:49.069 --> 00:52:49.079 align:start position:0%
list of options presented by the federal
 
00:52:52.309 --> 00:52:52.319 align:start position:0%
government to avoid criminal prostiution
 
00:52:55.109 --> 00:52:55.119 align:start position:0%
for veterans with disabilities it's an
 
00:52:56.829 --> 00:52:56.839 align:start position:0%
option for the parent to apply for the
 
00:52:58.230 --> 00:52:58.240 align:start position:0%
apportionment claim the state does not
 
00:53:01.349 --> 00:53:01.359 align:start position:0%
do it um I've been dealing with that for
 
00:53:04.670 --> 00:53:04.680 align:start position:0%
over 10 years I am also a veteran um and
 
00:53:08.430 --> 00:53:08.440 align:start position:0%
I I would really sort of ask why would
 
00:53:09.990 --> 00:53:10.000 align:start position:0%
it be that if I'm a veteran I'm trying
 
00:53:12.190 --> 00:53:12.200 align:start position:0%
to get my child support payment when I
 
00:53:14.270 --> 00:53:14.280 align:start position:0%
get less money than he does that my
 
00:53:17.910 --> 00:53:17.920 align:start position:0%
consideration is less so or my child's
 
00:53:20.510 --> 00:53:20.520 align:start position:0%
consideration is less because really
 
00:53:22.630 --> 00:53:22.640 align:start position:0%
alimony and stuff between spouses
 
00:53:24.510 --> 00:53:24.520 align:start position:0%
spouses can fend for themselves kids
 
00:53:26.710 --> 00:53:26.720 align:start position:0%
cannot and kids need to be taken care of
 
00:53:29.750 --> 00:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
and kids deserve that um so I guess
 
00:53:33.150 --> 00:53:33.160 align:start position:0%
that's kind of it I hope you have
 
00:53:34.270 --> 00:53:34.280 align:start position:0%
questions for me because I'm very
 
00:53:36.829 --> 00:53:36.839 align:start position:0%
familiar with this process very good
 
00:53:39.670 --> 00:53:39.680 align:start position:0%
thank thank you Miss Ryan um we do have
 
00:53:44.549 --> 00:53:44.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:47.230 --> 00:53:47.240 align:start position:0%
horn thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
00:53:49.870 --> 00:53:49.880 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
00:53:55.430 --> 00:53:55.440 align:start position:0%
um somebody told me that um
 
00:53:59.230 --> 00:53:59.240 align:start position:0%
the dependence factor into the
 
00:54:01.510 --> 00:54:01.520 align:start position:0%
disability uh calculation and I was
 
00:54:03.270 --> 00:54:03.280 align:start position:0%
wondering if you could confirm that for
 
00:54:05.829 --> 00:54:05.839 align:start position:0%
me so that even if you're 90 if you are
 
00:54:08.750 --> 00:54:08.760 align:start position:0%
90% disabled you get a payment if you
 
00:54:11.589 --> 00:54:11.599 align:start position:0%
are 90% disabled with kids um your
 
00:54:13.230 --> 00:54:13.240 align:start position:0%
payment would be larger could you help
 
00:54:16.470 --> 00:54:16.480 align:start position:0%
me with that yes I can confirm that the
 
00:54:18.549 --> 00:54:18.559 align:start position:0%
actual payment for a spouse is higher
 
00:54:20.109 --> 00:54:20.119 align:start position:0%
than anything else because I think for a
 
00:54:22.270 --> 00:54:22.280 align:start position:0%
spouse you get I don't know the exact
 
00:54:23.470 --> 00:54:23.480 align:start position:0%
amount and I'd have to look it up but
 
00:54:26.710 --> 00:54:26.720 align:start position:0%
it's it's a it's possibly $200
 
00:54:29.150 --> 00:54:29.160 align:start position:0%
um for your first child it can be around
 
00:54:32.510 --> 00:54:32.520 align:start position:0%
$100 but it decreases with each child um
 
00:54:34.750 --> 00:54:34.760 align:start position:0%
in this case my son is his third child
 
00:54:40.829 --> 00:54:40.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:44.150 --> 00:54:44.160 align:start position:0%
son follow up uh representative horn
 
00:54:50.349 --> 00:54:50.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:52.750 --> 00:54:52.760 align:start position:0%
grman thank you chairman
 
00:54:56.510 --> 00:54:56.520 align:start position:0%
long and thank you Mora Ryan for coming
 
00:54:58.230 --> 00:54:58.240 align:start position:0%
to testify before
 
00:55:01.309 --> 00:55:01.319 align:start position:0%
us um thank you for having me thank you
 
00:55:03.470 --> 00:55:03.480 align:start position:0%
for your service as well and I'm a mom
 
00:55:05.990 --> 00:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
to a 15-year-old with autism so I know
 
00:55:08.109 --> 00:55:08.119 align:start position:0%
what life is can look
 
00:55:11.549 --> 00:55:11.559 align:start position:0%
like needing a lot of support um I just
 
00:55:15.789 --> 00:55:15.799 align:start position:0%
have a I have a question regarding um
 
00:55:20.349 --> 00:55:20.359 align:start position:0%
enforcement of the benefits the medical
 
00:55:23.710 --> 00:55:23.720 align:start position:0%
benefits are there any consequences or
 
00:55:26.109 --> 00:55:26.119 align:start position:0%
ways of enforcement you've said that you
 
00:55:27.710 --> 00:55:27.720 align:start position:0%
have haven't received those
 
00:55:27.720 --> 00:55:29.230 align:start position:0%
have haven't received those
payments

00:55:29.230 --> 00:55:29.240 align:start position:0%
payments
 
00:55:32.589 --> 00:55:32.599 align:start position:0%
but are there any consequences in the
 
00:55:36.630 --> 00:55:36.640 align:start position:0%
system or does it just keep on spiraling
 
00:55:39.309 --> 00:55:39.319 align:start position:0%
of not so in your divorce decree it
 
00:55:41.630 --> 00:55:41.640 align:start position:0%
states that he should be um providing
 
00:55:45.670 --> 00:55:45.680 align:start position:0%
the medical uh Insurance yes a
 
00:55:48.870 --> 00:55:48.880 align:start position:0%
consequence for not doing that the only
 
00:55:51.309 --> 00:55:51.319 align:start position:0%
way for me to enforce that is for me to
 
00:55:54.109 --> 00:55:54.119 align:start position:0%
try and get a contempt order and TR at
 
00:55:56.270 --> 00:55:56.280 align:start position:0%
this at this time he's over two years in
 
00:55:59.190 --> 00:55:59.200 align:start position:0%
$5,000 so I could pursue a Federal
 
00:56:00.789 --> 00:56:00.799 align:start position:0%
Criminal prosecution which would put him
 
00:56:03.589 --> 00:56:03.599 align:start position:0%
in prison but as I said I see that as
 
00:56:05.349 --> 00:56:05.359 align:start position:0%
counterproductive to our interest
 
00:56:07.390 --> 00:56:07.400 align:start position:0%
because I would like him to pay the
 
00:56:08.950 --> 00:56:08.960 align:start position:0%
child support but I don't necessarily
 
00:56:11.309 --> 00:56:11.319 align:start position:0%
want him to go to prison to do it so
 
00:56:12.630 --> 00:56:12.640 align:start position:0%
that's the
 
00:56:15.309 --> 00:56:15.319 align:start position:0%
only option there are no
 
00:56:17.870 --> 00:56:17.880 align:start position:0%
ways places along the way to get
 
00:56:21.029 --> 00:56:21.039 align:start position:0%
enforcement he has voluntary voluntary
 
00:56:22.670 --> 00:56:22.680 align:start position:0%
options of enforcement but he has not
 
00:56:24.349 --> 00:56:24.359 align:start position:0%
taken them and I think that speaks
 
00:56:25.990 --> 00:56:26.000 align:start position:0%
loudly anybody who's dealt with family
 
00:56:28.670 --> 00:56:28.680 align:start position:0%
law knows that co-parenting is difficult
 
00:56:30.789 --> 00:56:30.799 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't really work the way we
 
00:56:32.990 --> 00:56:33.000 align:start position:0%
think it will obviously because the
 
00:56:34.430 --> 00:56:34.440 align:start position:0%
police station is the drop off and
 
00:56:37.910 --> 00:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
pickup point for a lot of people it
 
00:56:40.349 --> 00:56:40.359 align:start position:0%
co-parenting is difficult for many
 
00:56:44.230 --> 00:56:44.240 align:start position:0%
people and in our like in in his case he
 
00:56:45.670 --> 00:56:45.680 align:start position:0%
could apply for Social Security
 
00:56:48.630 --> 00:56:48.640 align:start position:0%
disability he chooses not to and I have
 
00:56:50.270 --> 00:56:50.280 align:start position:0%
no way of forcing him to do it and I
 
00:56:51.829 --> 00:56:51.839 align:start position:0%
wish he would because at least I would
 
00:56:51.839 --> 00:56:53.990 align:start position:0%
wish he would because at least I would
get

00:56:53.990 --> 00:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
get
 
00:56:57.870 --> 00:56:57.880 align:start position:0%
something thank you representative

never been able to get him to sign off

your testimony today I appreciate U what
 
00:59:17.789 --> 00:59:17.799 align:start position:0%
you've said um I do have a couple of um
 
00:59:19.789 --> 00:59:19.799 align:start position:0%
additional points to what Miss Ryan said
 
00:59:22.190 --> 00:59:22.200 align:start position:0%
um she's a very unique situation because
 
00:59:24.829 --> 00:59:24.839 align:start position:0%
she is dual mil military with the chap
 
00:59:28.710 --> 00:59:28.720 align:start position:0%
VA um can petition the VA to send in
 
00:59:30.109 --> 00:59:30.119 align:start position:0%
with a copy of the child's birth
 
00:59:32.950 --> 00:59:32.960 align:start position:0%
certificate and show that the other
 
00:59:34.750 --> 00:59:34.760 align:start position:0%
veteran is 100% And they will
 
00:59:37.589 --> 00:59:37.599 align:start position:0%
automatically put her put the child on
 
00:59:38.750 --> 00:59:38.760 align:start position:0%
um I've gone through this with a few
 
00:59:41.910 --> 00:59:41.920 align:start position:0%
other veterans um unfortunately there
 
00:59:43.710 --> 00:59:43.720 align:start position:0%
are certain situations with every
 
00:59:46.589 --> 00:59:46.599 align:start position:0%
veteran that make the cases unique um
 
00:59:48.510 --> 00:59:48.520 align:start position:0%
with my current case um which I'm sure
 
00:59:49.630 --> 00:59:49.640 align:start position:0%
some of you have seen at the New
 
00:59:52.270 --> 00:59:52.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court um the biggest
 
00:59:54.630 --> 00:59:54.640 align:start position:0%
issue that I ran into was asking for due
 
00:59:56.630 --> 00:59:56.640 align:start position:0%
process through the im9
 
00:59:59.069 --> 00:59:59.079 align:start position:0%
9803 um I asserted my rights through due
 
01:00:00.950 --> 01:00:00.960 align:start position:0%
process for the 14th Amendment of the US
 
01:00:03.750 --> 01:00:03.760 align:start position:0%
Constitution as well as the 14th article
 
01:00:05.990 --> 01:00:06.000 align:start position:0%
and 15 article of the New Hampshire Bill
 
01:00:08.670 --> 01:00:08.680 align:start position:0%
of Rights um I was denied this process
 
01:00:11.549 --> 01:00:11.559 align:start position:0%
specifically stating that the family
 
01:00:16.029 --> 01:00:16.039 align:start position:0%
courts are to adhere to the um New
 
01:00:19.190 --> 01:00:19.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire RSA 458 C5 um and that was
 
01:00:22.390 --> 01:00:22.400 align:start position:0%
directly um outlined in my divorce which
 
01:00:24.309 --> 01:00:24.319 align:start position:0%
is why my case went up to the New
 
01:00:26.109 --> 01:00:26.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire supreme court because they had
 
01:00:29.069 --> 01:00:29.079 align:start position:0%
overstepped the IM 9803 which is the
 
01:00:30.630 --> 01:00:30.640 align:start position:0%
apportionment process for disabled
 
01:00:32.870 --> 01:00:32.880 align:start position:0%
veterans who may be on Social Security
 
01:00:36.069 --> 01:00:36.079 align:start position:0%
which I am a little background on me um
 
01:00:38.470 --> 01:00:38.480 align:start position:0%
I was in the military under five years
 
01:00:41.349 --> 01:00:41.359 align:start position:0%
um I was discharged medically um when I
 
01:00:43.309 --> 01:00:43.319 align:start position:0%
went in I was physically and mentally
 
01:00:48.270 --> 01:00:48.280 align:start position:0%
fit I came out um and I basically was
 
01:00:51.789 --> 01:00:51.799 align:start position:0%
broken um since then I also worked for
 
01:00:54.270 --> 01:00:54.280 align:start position:0%
the federal service um I was retired
 
01:00:58.390 --> 01:00:58.400 align:start position:0%
under OPM dis retirement through the
 
01:01:01.069 --> 01:01:01.079 align:start position:0%
federal service um since then I've had
 
01:01:04.829 --> 01:01:04.839 align:start position:0%
26 surgeries due to my military injuries
 
01:01:06.910 --> 01:01:06.920 align:start position:0%
um I've also not been able to contain a
 
01:01:10.670 --> 01:01:10.680 align:start position:0%
stable job despite what my background is
 
01:01:12.510 --> 01:01:12.520 align:start position:0%
um based on that I went through the
 
01:01:14.789 --> 01:01:14.799 align:start position:0%
processes I needed to with the VA I had
 
01:01:16.710 --> 01:01:16.720 align:start position:0%
to go through many hurdles as some may
 
01:01:19.630 --> 01:01:19.640 align:start position:0%
know of how they work and despite that I
 
01:01:21.710 --> 01:01:21.720 align:start position:0%
was able to come out 100% permanent in
 
01:01:24.510 --> 01:01:24.520 align:start position:0%
total back dated to when I got off of
 
01:01:26.990 --> 01:01:27.000 align:start position:0%
active duty back in 200
 
01:01:30.069 --> 01:01:30.079 align:start position:0%
seven um I went through a divorce it was
 
01:01:31.950 --> 01:01:31.960 align:start position:0%
very contentious um there is no doubt
 
01:01:34.349 --> 01:01:34.359 align:start position:0%
about that um but there's not a single
 
01:01:36.549 --> 01:01:36.559 align:start position:0%
veteran that I know that's a parent that
 
01:01:38.630 --> 01:01:38.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't want to help parent their child
 
01:01:41.270 --> 01:01:41.280 align:start position:0%
including paying child support I 100%
 
01:01:44.430 --> 01:01:44.440 align:start position:0%
believe that that is my child's I owe it
 
01:01:47.390 --> 01:01:47.400 align:start position:0%
to them to give them every bit that I
 
01:01:53.069 --> 01:01:53.079 align:start position:0%
can um my issues come from my income um
 
01:01:57.150 --> 01:01:57.160 align:start position:0%
is disability 100% um through the feds
 
01:01:59.230 --> 01:01:59.240 align:start position:0%
through the VA and through Social
 
01:02:01.430 --> 01:02:01.440 align:start position:0%
Security um there were a couple of
 
01:02:04.069 --> 01:02:04.079 align:start position:0%
points that were made today about the
 
01:02:07.029 --> 01:02:07.039 align:start position:0%
review that UNH does um with Kristen
 
01:02:09.630 --> 01:02:09.640 align:start position:0%
Smith that she did recently um I did
 
01:02:13.269 --> 01:02:13.279 align:start position:0%
contact Miss Smith and U or Dr Smith and
 
01:02:15.710 --> 01:02:15.720 align:start position:0%
they clearly stated that they did not
 
01:02:18.349 --> 01:02:18.359 align:start position:0%
take any information taken into account
 
01:02:20.870 --> 01:02:20.880 align:start position:0%
if somebody was a veteran so when the
 
01:02:23.789 --> 01:02:23.799 align:start position:0%
court goes ahead and submits the child
 
01:02:25.549 --> 01:02:25.559 align:start position:0%
support order to the state they're not
 
01:02:27.430 --> 01:02:27.440 align:start position:0%
sure they're a vetan veteran so they're
 
01:02:30.109 --> 01:02:30.119 align:start position:0%
not able to conduct the IM
 
01:02:33.269 --> 01:02:33.279 align:start position:0%
9803 however uh Mary Beth odini who is a
 
01:02:36.269 --> 01:02:36.279 align:start position:0%
supervisor over there as well as um
 
01:02:38.349 --> 01:02:38.359 align:start position:0%
Jenny rhods who's also supervisor over
 
01:02:41.109 --> 01:02:41.119 align:start position:0%
there in the title 4D office um I asked
 
01:02:43.549 --> 01:02:43.559 align:start position:0%
them multiple times to start the process
 
01:02:46.069 --> 01:02:46.079 align:start position:0%
of the IM 9803 which it clearly states
 
01:02:48.990 --> 01:02:49.000 align:start position:0%
in section one on page two that the
 
01:02:51.829 --> 01:02:51.839 align:start position:0%
state 4D office and the oblig are to
 
01:02:55.630 --> 01:02:55.640 align:start position:0%
submit an ement request to the VA um I
 
01:02:57.430 --> 01:02:57.440 align:start position:0%
was was told multiple times that they do
 
01:02:59.870 --> 01:02:59.880 align:start position:0%
not do that and that they would enforce
 
01:03:01.910 --> 01:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
to whatever degree they could up
 
01:03:04.950 --> 01:03:04.960 align:start position:0%
including um sanctions and could cause
 
01:03:07.029 --> 01:03:07.039 align:start position:0%
me to be in contempt with a court order
 
01:03:08.950 --> 01:03:08.960 align:start position:0%
despite asking for a garnishment and
 
01:03:12.269 --> 01:03:12.279 align:start position:0%
despite asking um for them to not
 
01:03:14.069 --> 01:03:14.079 align:start position:0%
enforce because I was in an appeal
 
01:03:16.990 --> 01:03:17.000 align:start position:0%
process um the state refused to do that
 
01:03:18.750 --> 01:03:18.760 align:start position:0%
in fact they sent me letters stating I
 
01:03:20.190 --> 01:03:20.200 align:start position:0%
was out of compliance and that they were
 
01:03:23.390 --> 01:03:23.400 align:start position:0%
going to enforce orders um including
 
01:03:25.789 --> 01:03:25.799 align:start position:0%
taking any anything that I may have
 
01:03:28.789 --> 01:03:28.799 align:start position:0%
including my driver's license um on top
 
01:03:33.390 --> 01:03:33.400 align:start position:0%
of that when they submitted um
 
01:03:35.910 --> 01:03:35.920 align:start position:0%
the request from me to to show that I
 
01:03:38.789 --> 01:03:38.799 align:start position:0%
was in an appeal they also dis discarded
 
01:03:40.029 --> 01:03:40.039 align:start position:0%
that and stated that they were still
 
01:03:42.710 --> 01:03:42.720 align:start position:0%
going to enforce and that I needed to
 
01:03:44.029 --> 01:03:44.039 align:start position:0%
figure out how I was going to get the
 
01:03:47.150 --> 01:03:47.160 align:start position:0%
additional funds um which as 100% uh
 
01:03:50.470 --> 01:03:50.480 align:start position:0%
permanent total I am not able to work um
 
01:03:52.430 --> 01:03:52.440 align:start position:0%
it's not that I choose not to work I
 
01:03:56.670 --> 01:03:56.680 align:start position:0%
physically cannot um at this time
 
01:04:00.069 --> 01:04:00.079 align:start position:0%
um I have my daughter UH 60 to 70% of
 
01:04:04.150 --> 01:04:04.160 align:start position:0%
the time I was able to obtain uh 50 50
 
01:04:07.390 --> 01:04:07.400 align:start position:0%
with my my ex-wife um but that on top of
 
01:04:09.910 --> 01:04:09.920 align:start position:0%
includes um in my testimony that I've
 
01:04:12.069 --> 01:04:12.079 align:start position:0%
provided you today on top of paying
 
01:04:14.470 --> 01:04:14.480 align:start position:0%
child support I also was ordered to pay
 
01:04:16.870 --> 01:04:16.880 align:start position:0%
Private health insurance which costs me
 
01:04:21.430 --> 01:04:21.440 align:start position:0%
over $621 for myself in my child um I
 
01:04:23.990 --> 01:04:24.000 align:start position:0%
also was told to pay child costs
 
01:04:26.589 --> 01:04:26.599 align:start position:0%
including um the amount of money I spent
 
01:04:29.510 --> 01:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
to have spent time with her
 
01:04:32.710 --> 01:04:32.720 align:start position:0%
um and with that on top of Child Support
 
01:04:36.670 --> 01:04:36.680 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm looking over, dollar a month um
 
01:04:38.789 --> 01:04:38.799 align:start position:0%
again I'm not saying I shouldn't pay
 
01:04:40.549 --> 01:04:40.559 align:start position:0%
child support I'm just asking that the
 
01:04:43.269 --> 01:04:43.279 align:start position:0%
state go through the IM 9803 which was
 
01:04:46.150 --> 01:04:46.160 align:start position:0%
given out back in 1998 from the August
 
01:04:50.029 --> 01:04:50.039 align:start position:0%
1998 committee with the VA um down in um
 
01:04:51.510 --> 01:04:51.520 align:start position:0%
Congress and
 
01:04:55.309 --> 01:04:55.319 align:start position:0%
DC again with the due process rights
 
01:04:58.670 --> 01:04:58.680 align:start position:0%
that I had requested I was denied at the
 
01:05:00.470 --> 01:05:00.480 align:start position:0%
local Court I went to Supreme Court I
 
01:05:03.190 --> 01:05:03.200 align:start position:0%
was also denied I went ahead and I filed
 
01:05:05.990 --> 01:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
the Congressional um because I had asked
 
01:05:07.910 --> 01:05:07.920 align:start position:0%
the VA what I could do and they said
 
01:05:09.589 --> 01:05:09.599 align:start position:0%
since I was the veteran I could not ask
 
01:05:11.990 --> 01:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
for it to be done that the state must uh
 
01:05:14.069 --> 01:05:14.079 align:start position:0%
start the process I filed the
 
01:05:16.510 --> 01:05:16.520 align:start position:0%
Congressional with Congress Pap's office
 
01:05:19.750 --> 01:05:19.760 align:start position:0%
they did assist um the state still
 
01:05:23.190 --> 01:05:23.200 align:start position:0%
refused to do the IM 9803 I went down to
 
01:05:27.150 --> 01:05:27.160 align:start position:0%
Boston uh Regional um where the AFC
 
01:05:29.190 --> 01:05:29.200 align:start position:0%
where the Mandate comes out of at the at
 
01:05:30.630 --> 01:05:30.640 align:start position:0%
the second page you could see the
 
01:05:33.029 --> 01:05:33.039 align:start position:0%
regional office information down there I
 
01:05:35.069 --> 01:05:35.079 align:start position:0%
spoke with Miss relle Phillips who
 
01:05:36.630 --> 01:05:36.640 align:start position:0%
contacted the state of New Hampshire
 
01:05:38.150 --> 01:05:38.160 align:start position:0%
once she found out that the state was
 
01:05:40.470 --> 01:05:40.480 align:start position:0%
not being in compliance with the IM
 
01:05:42.950 --> 01:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
9803 and the state went ahead and
 
01:05:46.109 --> 01:05:46.119 align:start position:0%
started the IM 9803 process what they
 
01:05:48.510 --> 01:05:48.520 align:start position:0%
also did is they informed the oblige
 
01:05:50.910 --> 01:05:50.920 align:start position:0%
that she was not required to participate
 
01:05:53.109 --> 01:05:53.119 align:start position:0%
in the actual process which would be
 
01:05:55.430 --> 01:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
looked at as obstruction of justice um
 
01:05:57.670 --> 01:05:57.680 align:start position:0%
by not doing that that does not provide
 
01:05:59.470 --> 01:05:59.480 align:start position:0%
me with due process because then the VA
 
01:06:02.190 --> 01:06:02.200 align:start position:0%
cannot look at both Apples to Apples to
 
01:06:05.150 --> 01:06:05.160 align:start position:0%
see what the child needs are um by doing
 
01:06:07.549 --> 01:06:07.559 align:start position:0%
that was a detriment to myself I almost
 
01:06:09.630 --> 01:06:09.640 align:start position:0%
lost my home I was in foreclosure for
 
01:06:12.109 --> 01:06:12.119 align:start position:0%
nearly 24 months I went through the
 
01:06:13.510 --> 01:06:13.520 align:start position:0%
Department of Veterans Affairs for
 
01:06:15.510 --> 01:06:15.520 align:start position:0%
assistance I even went as far as
 
01:06:17.750 --> 01:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
applying to section 8 housing I received
 
01:06:20.309 --> 01:06:20.319 align:start position:0%
a letter back from section 8 that stated
 
01:06:23.150 --> 01:06:23.160 align:start position:0%
there was a s to n year weight period
 
01:06:26.430 --> 01:06:26.440 align:start position:0%
despite being an honorable and abled
 
01:06:29.349 --> 01:06:29.359 align:start position:0%
veteran with that being said I went
 
01:06:32.549 --> 01:06:32.559 align:start position:0%
through and I applied through the DHHS
 
01:06:35.390 --> 01:06:35.400 align:start position:0%
for assistance for my child and for me
 
01:06:37.910 --> 01:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
and despite me providing to them their
 
01:06:40.990 --> 01:06:41.000 align:start position:0%
own um manual the
 
01:06:44.109 --> 01:06:44.119 align:start position:0%
FMS FSM
 
01:06:47.190 --> 01:06:47.200 align:start position:0%
SR5 um dated
 
01:06:49.990 --> 01:06:50.000 align:start position:0%
0100 it does say that veterans benefits
 
01:06:52.910 --> 01:06:52.920 align:start position:0%
are to be included as earned as unearned
 
01:06:55.150 --> 01:06:55.160 align:start position:0%
income with the exception that benefits
 
01:06:57.910 --> 01:06:57.920 align:start position:0%
specific speically designated as payment
 
01:07:00.430 --> 01:07:00.440 align:start position:0%
for hospitalization or medical service
 
01:07:03.549 --> 01:07:03.559 align:start position:0%
are excluded income um based on what my
 
01:07:05.349 --> 01:07:05.359 align:start position:0%
injuries entail as also what
 
01:07:07.870 --> 01:07:07.880 align:start position:0%
representative alal borsa um provided
 
01:07:10.269 --> 01:07:10.279 align:start position:0%
with us I take medications and have to
 
01:07:12.269 --> 01:07:12.279 align:start position:0%
be seen by outside providers because a
 
01:07:15.829 --> 01:07:15.839 align:start position:0%
VA can't provide me what what I need um
 
01:07:18.510 --> 01:07:18.520 align:start position:0%
those that amount goes over what my
 
01:07:22.269 --> 01:07:22.279 align:start position:0%
child support um self- sustainment is so
 
01:07:25.309 --> 01:07:25.319 align:start position:0%
right there I'm already in a hole um in
 
01:07:27.950 --> 01:07:27.960 align:start position:0%
add addition to the um the aid in
 
01:07:29.630 --> 01:07:29.640 align:start position:0%
attendance that somebody did mention on
 
01:07:31.990 --> 01:07:32.000 align:start position:0%
here today the aid in attendance is for
 
01:07:34.589 --> 01:07:34.599 align:start position:0%
specific disabled veterans um that need
 
01:07:37.190 --> 01:07:37.200 align:start position:0%
to qualify for that and there is a
 
01:07:38.950 --> 01:07:38.960 align:start position:0%
backlog to receive that you have to go
 
01:07:40.109 --> 01:07:40.119 align:start position:0%
through a very
 
01:07:43.710 --> 01:07:43.720 align:start position:0%
strenuous um clear um checks and
 
01:07:45.349 --> 01:07:45.359 align:start position:0%
balances I guess you can put and there's
 
01:07:47.549 --> 01:07:47.559 align:start position:0%
a lot of red tape I've applied for
 
01:07:49.470 --> 01:07:49.480 align:start position:0%
almost every single program I can
 
01:07:51.670 --> 01:07:51.680 align:start position:0%
qualify for and unfortunately I'm met
 
01:07:54.190 --> 01:07:54.200 align:start position:0%
with a lot of denials it doesn't mean
 
01:07:55.870 --> 01:07:55.880 align:start position:0%
that I don't want to help my child it
 
01:07:58.430 --> 01:07:58.440 align:start position:0%
means that I'm trying everything I can
 
01:08:00.670 --> 01:08:00.680 align:start position:0%
but I can't sustain my own life let
 
01:08:03.670 --> 01:08:03.680 align:start position:0%
alone my child's if I can't live with
 
01:08:05.390 --> 01:08:05.400 align:start position:0%
the amount of money that I have and my
 
01:08:08.390 --> 01:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
legal well my legal bills themselves and
 
01:08:11.190 --> 01:08:11.200 align:start position:0%
also my medical issues as they are there
 
01:08:15.069 --> 01:08:15.079 align:start position:0%
is a program called HUD HUD Vash through
 
01:08:18.390 --> 01:08:18.400 align:start position:0%
the VA that is assisting veterans um but
 
01:08:20.110 --> 01:08:20.120 align:start position:0%
what they're finding is also that
 
01:08:21.749 --> 01:08:21.759 align:start position:0%
they're actually taking including their
 
01:08:24.470 --> 01:08:24.480 align:start position:0%
disability compensation for their child
 
01:08:26.749 --> 01:08:26.759 align:start position:0%
support and it's Le the veteran literal
 
01:08:29.789 --> 01:08:29.799 align:start position:0%
literally nothing um to even have for
 
01:08:32.430 --> 01:08:32.440 align:start position:0%
food um we don't qualify for snap
 
01:08:34.430 --> 01:08:34.440 align:start position:0%
because we're over income because of the
 
01:08:35.910 --> 01:08:35.920 align:start position:0%
VA disability
 
01:08:39.990 --> 01:08:40.000 align:start position:0%
benefits um there was another um report
 
01:08:42.269 --> 01:08:42.279 align:start position:0%
out by the Department of Defense in May
 
01:08:45.229 --> 01:08:45.239 align:start position:0%
2018 which I can provide to the board
 
01:08:49.229 --> 01:08:49.239 align:start position:0%
where the May uh 2018 DOD report shows
 
01:08:51.390 --> 01:08:51.400 align:start position:0%
that they do see that the disability
 
01:08:54.030 --> 01:08:54.040 align:start position:0%
compensation does have a portion that is
 
01:08:55.789 --> 01:08:55.799 align:start position:0%
aable for the family but they see that
 
01:08:58.309 --> 01:08:58.319 align:start position:0%
those funds are to sustain for the
 
01:09:00.749 --> 01:09:00.759 align:start position:0%
disability V the disabled veteran
 
01:09:02.510 --> 01:09:02.520 align:start position:0%
because of the injuries they
 
01:09:05.430 --> 01:09:05.440 align:start position:0%
sustain um based on the testimony today
 
01:09:08.030 --> 01:09:08.040 align:start position:0%
that we heard from the fiscal note with
 
01:09:11.709 --> 01:09:11.719 align:start position:0%
the um I think it was the fourth um I
 
01:09:15.229 --> 01:09:15.239 align:start position:0%
forget I'm sorry I apologize um for the
 
01:09:17.149 --> 01:09:17.159 align:start position:0%
note that's in there the regulation
 
01:09:20.789 --> 01:09:20.799 align:start position:0%
under 45 CFR uh
 
01:09:24.149 --> 01:09:24.159 align:start position:0%
459a um remuneration for employment is
 
01:09:26.630 --> 01:09:26.640 align:start position:0%
based on if you received income from
 
01:09:29.030 --> 01:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
that employment um since disability
 
01:09:31.030 --> 01:09:31.040 align:start position:0%
compensation has nothing to do with the
 
01:09:32.229 --> 01:09:32.239 align:start position:0%
time of service that you were in
 
01:09:34.829 --> 01:09:34.839 align:start position:0%
including your rank or your pay is not
 
01:09:36.709 --> 01:09:36.719 align:start position:0%
it is not included as income which is
 
01:09:38.950 --> 01:09:38.960 align:start position:0%
why the IRS does not include it in your
 
01:09:41.390 --> 01:09:41.400 align:start position:0%
taxes in addition the New Hampshire
 
01:09:44.590 --> 01:09:44.600 align:start position:0%
judicial system when you are looking at
 
01:09:46.669 --> 01:09:46.679 align:start position:0%
doing any type of civil procedures if
 
01:09:48.470 --> 01:09:48.480 align:start position:0%
you look on the protected income list
 
01:09:49.950 --> 01:09:49.960 align:start position:0%
you will see veterans disability
 
01:09:53.990 --> 01:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
benefits and that reflects 38
 
01:09:56.149 --> 01:09:56.159 align:start position:0%
5301a um
 
01:09:59.229 --> 01:09:59.239 align:start position:0%
I ask that this board um approves this
 
01:10:02.110 --> 01:10:02.120 align:start position:0%
and and listens to our testimony um and
 
01:10:03.790 --> 01:10:03.800 align:start position:0%
if there's any questions I can answer
 
01:10:05.149 --> 01:10:05.159 align:start position:0%
please let me
 
01:10:08.550 --> 01:10:08.560 align:start position:0%
know thank you Mr bronstein uh
 
01:10:12.390 --> 01:10:12.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:16.310 --> 01:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
yella I thank you uh for for recognizing
 
01:10:18.149 --> 01:10:18.159 align:start position:0%
me thank you for taking the question my
 
01:10:22.110 --> 01:10:22.120 align:start position:0%
question is um in regards to
 
01:10:26.030 --> 01:10:26.040 align:start position:0%
this uh state agency uh state Child
 
01:10:30.430 --> 01:10:30.440 align:start position:0%
Support Enforcement office not f um
 
01:10:35.350 --> 01:10:35.360 align:start position:0%
doing this uh apportionment request
 
01:10:39.709 --> 01:10:39.719 align:start position:0%
review um can that uh I don't see that
 
01:10:42.510 --> 01:10:42.520 align:start position:0%
this bill would address that issue and
 
01:10:45.709 --> 01:10:45.719 align:start position:0%
has um I guess has that been fully
 
01:10:50.030 --> 01:10:50.040 align:start position:0%
addressed now that the um that the state
 
01:10:53.110 --> 01:10:53.120 align:start position:0%
agency or in or
 
01:10:56.070 --> 01:10:56.080 align:start position:0%
this since the um
 
01:10:57.310 --> 01:10:57.320 align:start position:0%
like the commissioner or their
 
01:11:01.070 --> 01:11:01.080 align:start position:0%
representative from the VA contacted New
 
01:11:02.870 --> 01:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is that now being handled
 
01:11:04.950 --> 01:11:04.960 align:start position:0%
properly and so that's no longer an
 
01:11:08.790 --> 01:11:08.800 align:start position:0%
issue or do we need to um really address
 
01:11:13.669 --> 01:11:13.679 align:start position:0%
that in legislation or in some way um
 
01:11:16.310 --> 01:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
making that state agency follow that
 
01:11:19.149 --> 01:11:19.159 align:start position:0%
process and
 
01:11:21.669 --> 01:11:21.679 align:start position:0%
um yes
 
01:11:24.470 --> 01:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
so um thank you for your question um to
 
01:11:25.790 --> 01:11:25.800 align:start position:0%
answer simp
 
01:11:28.630 --> 01:11:28.640 align:start position:0%
um this what we've provided with just
 
01:11:30.550 --> 01:11:30.560 align:start position:0%
adding the sub paragraph in sub
 
01:11:32.870 --> 01:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
paragraph D essentially basically would
 
01:11:34.430 --> 01:11:34.440 align:start position:0%
show that the courts when they're
 
01:11:36.189 --> 01:11:36.199 align:start position:0%
looking to do child support that they
 
01:11:38.870 --> 01:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
would need to motion the state to
 
01:11:40.910 --> 01:11:40.920 align:start position:0%
initiate the apportionment process which
 
01:11:42.910 --> 01:11:42.920 align:start position:0%
is listed under IM
 
01:11:45.629 --> 01:11:45.639 align:start position:0%
9803 um from there it then goes to the
 
01:11:48.310 --> 01:11:48.320 align:start position:0%
VA which assesses the situation as well
 
01:11:50.870 --> 01:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
and comes back with the determination of
 
01:11:53.510 --> 01:11:53.520 align:start position:0%
what the veteran can actually provide
 
01:11:55.470 --> 01:11:55.480 align:start position:0%
through their compensation and then they
 
01:11:57.110 --> 01:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
can go ahead and apportionment directly
 
01:12:00.030 --> 01:12:00.040 align:start position:0%
to the custodial parent um if they deem
 
01:12:01.350 --> 01:12:01.360 align:start position:0%
that it is
 
01:12:05.030 --> 01:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
necessary um as far as is my situation
 
01:12:07.110 --> 01:12:07.120 align:start position:0%
cleared no it is not I actually had to
 
01:12:09.030 --> 01:12:09.040 align:start position:0%
file another Congressional this week and
 
01:12:11.270 --> 01:12:11.280 align:start position:0%
I had to place a complaint into the
 
01:12:13.629 --> 01:12:13.639 align:start position:0%
Civil Rights division um at the federal
 
01:12:15.709 --> 01:12:15.719 align:start position:0%
health and human services based on the
 
01:12:17.470 --> 01:12:17.480 align:start position:0%
non-compliance and the lack of due
 
01:12:19.310 --> 01:12:19.320 align:start position:0%
process I'm receiving through the New
 
01:12:22.709 --> 01:12:22.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire state courts my specific C
 
01:12:26.189 --> 01:12:26.199 align:start position:0%
case um did not include the IM 98 03
 
01:12:29.270 --> 01:12:29.280 align:start position:0%
they also listed the wrong um Federal
 
01:12:32.550 --> 01:12:32.560 align:start position:0%
quote um they actually the correct one
 
01:12:33.870 --> 01:12:33.880 align:start position:0%
should be
 
01:12:36.830 --> 01:12:36.840 align:start position:0%
3101 and they listed
 
01:12:39.590 --> 01:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
1301 um which has to do with voke rehab
 
01:12:42.149 --> 01:12:42.159 align:start position:0%
and not anything to do with my case so
 
01:12:44.189 --> 01:12:44.199 align:start position:0%
the the court didn't even look at the
 
01:12:46.149 --> 01:12:46.159 align:start position:0%
correct uh federal guidelines that I had
 
01:12:49.910 --> 01:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:52.790 --> 01:12:52.800 align:start position:0%

VA compensation is not income it is not

50% of the time with my ex-spouse
 
01:20:29.990 --> 01:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
um and at this time uh my only income is
 
01:20:33.750 --> 01:20:33.760 align:start position:0%
my veterans disability um I am in
 
01:20:36.470 --> 01:20:36.480 align:start position:0%
constant pain every day and just you
 
01:20:38.669 --> 01:20:38.679 align:start position:0%
know struggle to maintain any employment
 
01:20:41.430 --> 01:20:41.440 align:start position:0%
as I have over the years and
 
01:20:44.590 --> 01:20:44.600 align:start position:0%
um right now my main focus is taking
 
01:20:46.470 --> 01:20:46.480 align:start position:0%
care of my children and providing the
 
01:20:49.870 --> 01:20:49.880 align:start position:0%
best life to them as I can and um I am
 
01:20:52.790 --> 01:20:52.800 align:start position:0%
being ordered to pay
 
01:20:57.189 --> 01:20:57.199 align:start position:0%
um approximately 60% of my only income
 
01:21:00.110 --> 01:21:00.120 align:start position:0%
which is my veterans disability in child
 
01:21:03.350 --> 01:21:03.360 align:start position:0%
support payments for uh my ex who's also
 
01:21:07.149 --> 01:21:07.159 align:start position:0%
working full-time and also able to uh
 
01:21:09.910 --> 01:21:09.920 align:start position:0%
attend school over at uh Great Bay
 
01:21:13.390 --> 01:21:13.400 align:start position:0%
Community College uh my spouse also uh
 
01:21:16.669 --> 01:21:16.679 align:start position:0%
lives at home with her family uh rentree
 
01:21:20.149 --> 01:21:20.159 align:start position:0%
and I have been ordered to pay again my
 
01:21:24.590 --> 01:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
my only income uh at about 60% of it uh
 
01:21:27.950 --> 01:21:27.960 align:start position:0%
to her and um it's leaving me uh
 
01:21:31.750 --> 01:21:31.760 align:start position:0%
basically uh unable to care for myself
 
01:21:34.709 --> 01:21:34.719 align:start position:0%
or my my children uh for the 15 out of
 
01:21:37.070 --> 01:21:37.080 align:start position:0%
30 days while they're in my care uh
 
01:21:39.750 --> 01:21:39.760 align:start position:0%
without the assistance of my family uh
 
01:21:43.070 --> 01:21:43.080 align:start position:0%
my family is able to uh you know assist
 
01:21:44.870 --> 01:21:44.880 align:start position:0%
me with everything I need at this time
 
01:21:47.950 --> 01:21:47.960 align:start position:0%
but I need this process to be followed
 
01:21:50.270 --> 01:21:50.280 align:start position:0%
the apportionment process because uh
 
01:21:54.790 --> 01:21:54.800 align:start position:0%
they are calling my disability uh as a
 
01:21:56.830 --> 01:21:56.840 align:start position:0%
pension that's how they're listing it in
 
01:21:59.310 --> 01:21:59.320 align:start position:0%
the Child Support guideline
 
01:22:03.030 --> 01:22:03.040 align:start position:0%
worksheet and um it is uh basically
 
01:22:05.629 --> 01:22:05.639 align:start position:0%
leaving me uh you know unable to care
 
01:22:07.910 --> 01:22:07.920 align:start position:0%
for my family without the assistance of
 
01:22:11.750 --> 01:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
my family and um this is just you know
 
01:22:13.910 --> 01:22:13.920 align:start position:0%
wrong I know it's happening to me and I
 
01:22:15.830 --> 01:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
know it's happening to many other
 
01:22:19.430 --> 01:22:19.440 align:start position:0%
veterans out there um and this just
 
01:22:22.830 --> 01:22:22.840 align:start position:0%
needs to get fixed and the pment process
 
01:22:26.510 --> 01:22:26.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:29.030 --> 01:22:29.040 align:start position:0%
and um that's pretty much all all I have
 
01:22:30.870 --> 01:22:30.880 align:start position:0%
to say is because it's directly
 
01:22:33.070 --> 01:22:33.080 align:start position:0%
affecting me and my children and it's
 
01:22:34.870 --> 01:22:34.880 align:start position:0%
not that I'm and I've never missed a
 
01:22:36.709 --> 01:22:36.719 align:start position:0%
child support payment I've done
 
01:22:38.270 --> 01:22:38.280 align:start position:0%
everything I'm supposed to do I've
 
01:22:40.310 --> 01:22:40.320 align:start position:0%
followed all of the uh you know
 
01:22:43.310 --> 01:22:43.320 align:start position:0%
directions that have been put on me and
 
01:22:45.430 --> 01:22:45.440 align:start position:0%
this enforcment process is just not
 
01:22:48.470 --> 01:22:48.480 align:start position:0%
being followed and they are taking uh
 
01:22:51.310 --> 01:22:51.320 align:start position:0%
pretty much all of my income and giving
 
01:22:55.390 --> 01:22:55.400 align:start position:0%
it to my spouse uh this also um
 
01:22:57.950 --> 01:22:57.960 align:start position:0%
basically my spouse she's also receiving
 
01:23:00.709 --> 01:23:00.719 align:start position:0%
all the state benefits and this is
 
01:23:02.390 --> 01:23:02.400 align:start position:0%
really really hard for me too because
 
01:23:04.629 --> 01:23:04.639 align:start position:0%
with four children um you know their
 
01:23:06.990 --> 01:23:07.000 align:start position:0%
ages are six years old five years old
 
01:23:10.110 --> 01:23:10.120 align:start position:0%
and then I have twins that are three um
 
01:23:12.310 --> 01:23:12.320 align:start position:0%
I need to have them in daycare if I'm
 
01:23:15.950 --> 01:23:15.960 align:start position:0%
going to attempt to work but um at this
 
01:23:17.950 --> 01:23:17.960 align:start position:0%
time again my my disabilities are
 
01:23:20.510 --> 01:23:20.520 align:start position:0%
preventing that and the expenses for all
 
01:23:22.790 --> 01:23:22.800 align:start position:0%
the children are preventing that but uh
 
01:23:24.709 --> 01:23:24.719 align:start position:0%
my spouse who's not following the
 
01:23:26.510 --> 01:23:26.520 align:start position:0%
apportionment process she's receiving
 
01:23:28.590 --> 01:23:28.600 align:start position:0%
all the state aid she's getting daycare
 
01:23:30.950 --> 01:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
for free she's getting the food stamps
 
01:23:32.390 --> 01:23:32.400 align:start position:0%
she's getting all of those state
 
01:23:35.350 --> 01:23:35.360 align:start position:0%
benefits I've gone in and applied and I
 
01:23:38.310 --> 01:23:38.320 align:start position:0%
was told uh my children are being
 
01:23:41.590 --> 01:23:41.600 align:start position:0%
claimed by my spouse my ex spouse she's
 
01:23:44.110 --> 01:23:44.120 align:start position:0%
receiving 100% of all benefits paid for
 
01:23:47.030 --> 01:23:47.040 align:start position:0%
all those children and I have uh I
 
01:23:48.709 --> 01:23:48.719 align:start position:0%
cannot access them because the state
 
01:23:51.790 --> 01:23:51.800 align:start position:0%
will not pay out those benefits uh basic
 
01:23:53.830 --> 01:23:53.840 align:start position:0%
for my family for the 15 out 30 days
 
01:23:56.390 --> 01:23:56.400 align:start position:0%
they with me so my my ex spouse is
 
01:23:58.110 --> 01:23:58.120 align:start position:0%
receiving all this benefits she's
 
01:24:03.870 --> 01:24:03.880 align:start position:0%
getting my uh 60% of my disability um
 
01:24:06.750 --> 01:24:06.760 align:start position:0%
and she's working full-time so she her
 
01:24:09.830 --> 01:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
household is is got so much more uh
 
01:24:12.350 --> 01:24:12.360 align:start position:0%
availability for for money and and all
 
01:24:14.790 --> 01:24:14.800 align:start position:0%
that to support the children and I am
 
01:24:18.830 --> 01:24:18.840 align:start position:0%
just being uh you know left behind
 
01:24:23.189 --> 01:24:23.199 align:start position:0%
and uh if if this process was followed
 
01:24:25.149 --> 01:24:25.159 align:start position:0%
um you know it would not put such a
 
01:24:27.910 --> 01:24:27.920 align:start position:0%
hardship on myself and my four
 
01:24:30.149 --> 01:24:30.159 align:start position:0%
children um again you know I went
 
01:24:33.590 --> 01:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
through a very very volatile divorce uh
 
01:24:37.030 --> 01:24:37.040 align:start position:0%
separation process and I had to fight to
 
01:24:38.990 --> 01:24:39.000 align:start position:0%
to just prove that I'm uh you know
 
01:24:40.790 --> 01:24:40.800 align:start position:0%
caring for my children and all that and
 
01:24:42.750 --> 01:24:42.760 align:start position:0%
I and I was awarded legal residency for
 
01:24:44.950 --> 01:24:44.960 align:start position:0%
all four children after going through
 
01:24:48.870 --> 01:24:48.880 align:start position:0%
DCF and all that just to now uh you know
 
01:24:51.510 --> 01:24:51.520 align:start position:0%
now I have my children with me and now
 
01:24:53.709 --> 01:24:53.719 align:start position:0%
it's almost impossible to even you know
 
01:24:56.590 --> 01:24:56.600 align:start position:0%
raise them put food on the table with uh
 
01:24:59.430 --> 01:24:59.440 align:start position:0%
you know me being forced to pay almost
 
01:25:01.109 --> 01:25:01.119 align:start position:0%
all the dollars I receed on a monthly
 
01:25:04.189 --> 01:25:04.199 align:start position:0%
basis over to my ex spouse so I just
 
01:25:06.189 --> 01:25:06.199 align:start position:0%
wanted to you know be able to provide
 
01:25:08.430 --> 01:25:08.440 align:start position:0%
you know this is my testimony this is
 
01:25:10.590 --> 01:25:10.600 align:start position:0%
happening directly to me and for
 
01:25:12.790 --> 01:25:12.800 align:start position:0%
children uh identical twins that are
 
01:25:16.510 --> 01:25:16.520 align:start position:0%
three a five-year-old and a six-year-old
 
01:25:18.590 --> 01:25:18.600 align:start position:0%
and you know again they they're with me
 
01:25:23.310 --> 01:25:23.320 align:start position:0%
15 out of 30 days and it's just uh you
 
01:25:25.430 --> 01:25:25.440 align:start position:0%
know not right what's going going on I'm
 
01:25:27.910 --> 01:25:27.920 align:start position:0%
I'm unable to work uh at this time I've
 
01:25:30.390 --> 01:25:30.400 align:start position:0%
tried for many years and I I actually
 
01:25:33.350 --> 01:25:33.360 align:start position:0%
was working before um I even went
 
01:25:38.550 --> 01:25:38.560 align:start position:0%
through a a divorce process um I very
 
01:25:40.709 --> 01:25:40.719 align:start position:0%
very unique situation I I had gained
 
01:25:43.870 --> 01:25:43.880 align:start position:0%
appointment through my spouse's um
 
01:25:46.550 --> 01:25:46.560 align:start position:0%
brother uh he referred me I'd come
 
01:25:48.270 --> 01:25:48.280 align:start position:0%
straight out of the Marine Corps and he
 
01:25:50.270 --> 01:25:50.280 align:start position:0%
referred me there and you know in our
 
01:25:52.149 --> 01:25:52.159 align:start position:0%
divorce process there was restraining
 
01:25:53.910 --> 01:25:53.920 align:start position:0%
orders all that all all dismissed and
 
01:25:57.950 --> 01:25:57.960 align:start position:0%
thrown out um that cost me my job and so
 
01:26:01.470 --> 01:26:01.480 align:start position:0%
I at the time I was working uh and it
 
01:26:03.350 --> 01:26:03.360 align:start position:0%
was difficult uh again that job was
 
01:26:05.189 --> 01:26:05.199 align:start position:0%
ripped out from underneath my feet from
 
01:26:07.709 --> 01:26:07.719 align:start position:0%
a restraining order because uh you can't
 
01:26:10.390 --> 01:26:10.400 align:start position:0%
have uh you know family members where
 
01:26:11.990 --> 01:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
there's a restraining order working
 
01:26:13.229 --> 01:26:13.239 align:start position:0%
together in the same building right next
 
01:26:15.870 --> 01:26:15.880 align:start position:0%
to each other so I lost my job was fired
 
01:26:17.950 --> 01:26:17.960 align:start position:0%
and the family court just said you know
 
01:26:19.750 --> 01:26:19.760 align:start position:0%
you're making that money and they didn't
 
01:26:22.229 --> 01:26:22.239 align:start position:0%
care that I'm just 80% disabled and and
 
01:26:25.070 --> 01:26:25.080 align:start position:0%
again I I was rated at 80% disabled when
 
01:26:28.310 --> 01:26:28.320 align:start position:0%
I was 23 years old uh I again I served
 
01:26:30.390 --> 01:26:30.400 align:start position:0%
in the Infantry in the Marine Corps went
 
01:26:33.109 --> 01:26:33.119 align:start position:0%
to Afghanistan and you know some of my
 
01:26:34.990 --> 01:26:35.000 align:start position:0%
friends didn't come home and and the
 
01:26:37.229 --> 01:26:37.239 align:start position:0%
ones that did come home we went through
 
01:26:40.550 --> 01:26:40.560 align:start position:0%
uh some very very rough times and you
 
01:26:43.189 --> 01:26:43.199 align:start position:0%
know I I would say all my close friends
 
01:26:46.149 --> 01:26:46.159 align:start position:0%
that I served with they are all disabled
 
01:26:48.750 --> 01:26:48.760 align:start position:0%
veterans uh you know and we are all in
 
01:26:51.830 --> 01:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
in pain every single day I wake up my
 
01:26:54.910 --> 01:26:54.920 align:start position:0%
back's in in in an awful condition uh
 
01:26:58.030 --> 01:26:58.040 align:start position:0%
but I do what I need to do to support my
 
01:27:01.070 --> 01:27:01.080 align:start position:0%
children and uh you know care for myself
 
01:27:04.430 --> 01:27:04.440 align:start position:0%
but the apportionment process uh
 
01:27:06.270 --> 01:27:06.280 align:start position:0%
definitely needs to be followed and
 
01:27:08.750 --> 01:27:08.760 align:start position:0%
there's nothing that I can do you know
 
01:27:11.669 --> 01:27:11.679 align:start position:0%
at this point um other than ask them to
 
01:27:14.550 --> 01:27:14.560 align:start position:0%
follow it and they just say no and
 
01:27:18.629 --> 01:27:18.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:21.189 --> 01:27:21.199 align:start position:0%
pension and um that's that's pretty much
 
01:27:22.709 --> 01:27:22.719 align:start position:0%
all I have if anyone has any questions
 
01:27:26.270 --> 01:27:26.280 align:start position:0%
for me uh available to answer anything
 
01:27:31.149 --> 01:27:31.159 align:start position:0%
very good uh I don't see any hands up
 
01:27:33.550 --> 01:27:33.560 align:start position:0%
are there is there any member willing to
 
01:27:34.510 --> 01:27:34.520 align:start position:0%
ask a
 
01:27:37.470 --> 01:27:37.480 align:start position:0%
question uh CN n i i I do have a
 
01:27:40.470 --> 01:27:40.480 align:start position:0%
question Mr sansy so if if this bill
 
01:27:44.229 --> 01:27:44.239 align:start position:0%
were to go into to effect uh would pass
 
01:27:47.550 --> 01:27:47.560 align:start position:0%
in your current status how much support
 
01:27:51.149 --> 01:27:51.159 align:start position:0%
from you would would your children be
 
01:27:55.750 --> 01:27:55.760 align:start position:0%
getting um so they would essentially
 
01:27:58.070 --> 01:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
right now like I said my my uh spouse is
 
01:27:59.709 --> 01:27:59.719 align:start position:0%
receiving all the state benefits uh
 
01:28:01.629 --> 01:28:01.639 align:start position:0%
she's receiving uh you know daycare
 
01:28:04.830 --> 01:28:04.840 align:start position:0%
housing stiens all that um which I'm
 
01:28:07.430 --> 01:28:07.440 align:start position:0%
excluded from uh she has the kids half
 
01:28:11.070 --> 01:28:11.080 align:start position:0%
the time she's working full-time and I
 
01:28:13.030 --> 01:28:13.040 align:start position:0%
don't have a I don't have income I can't
 
01:28:15.510 --> 01:28:15.520 align:start position:0%
afford the child care costs I'm I'm
 
01:28:17.990 --> 01:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
unable to access those benefits and if
 
01:28:19.350 --> 01:28:19.360 align:start position:0%
they did they would just even the
 
01:28:21.550 --> 01:28:21.560 align:start position:0%
playing field the VA would look at you
 
01:28:23.830 --> 01:28:23.840 align:start position:0%
know they they would review uh how they
 
01:28:25.310 --> 01:28:25.320 align:start position:0%
do and they would see that I have the
 
01:28:28.270 --> 01:28:28.280 align:start position:0%
kids 15 out of 30 days 15 nights they
 
01:28:30.950 --> 01:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
are sleeping here with me under this
 
01:28:33.310 --> 01:28:33.320 align:start position:0%
under my roof and
 
01:28:36.189 --> 01:28:36.199 align:start position:0%
um uh basically it would just make it so
 
01:28:38.629 --> 01:28:38.639 align:start position:0%
that this living situation the children
 
01:28:40.790 --> 01:28:40.800 align:start position:0%
when they're with me that you know they
 
01:28:43.470 --> 01:28:43.480 align:start position:0%
they have an equal uh living environment
 
01:28:44.990 --> 01:28:45.000 align:start position:0%
they have the same amount of funding
 
01:28:47.750 --> 01:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
coming in here just because right now it
 
01:28:49.990 --> 01:28:50.000 align:start position:0%
it is completely an uneven weighted
 
01:28:54.270 --> 01:28:54.280 align:start position:0%
scale it's just it's not fair and when I
 
01:28:56.669 --> 01:28:56.679 align:start position:0%
am trying to have this Pro followed and
 
01:28:59.510 --> 01:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
and when I say no this is my disability
 
01:29:00.870 --> 01:29:00.880 align:start position:0%
uh you know they're looking at it and
 
01:29:02.790 --> 01:29:02.800 align:start position:0%
going no that is a pension that is
 
01:29:06.470 --> 01:29:06.480 align:start position:0%
income coming into you uh and it it is
 
01:29:09.070 --> 01:29:09.080 align:start position:0%
just disability compensation and and
 
01:29:13.790 --> 01:29:13.800 align:start position:0%
like I said uh uh 80% disabled you know
 
01:29:17.229 --> 01:29:17.239 align:start position:0%
it's not a joke it's very serious and um
 
01:29:19.590 --> 01:29:19.600 align:start position:0%
you know it affects myself and and all
 
01:29:22.229 --> 01:29:22.239 align:start position:0%
the other disabled veterans out there uh
 
01:29:24.590 --> 01:29:24.600 align:start position:0%
you know some people cannot work
 
01:29:29.350 --> 01:29:29.360 align:start position:0%
um and and right now um I'm just seeing
 
01:29:32.350 --> 01:29:32.360 align:start position:0%
this happen I've become aware of the
 
01:29:35.709 --> 01:29:35.719 align:start position:0%
legal process that needs to be followed
 
01:29:38.510 --> 01:29:38.520 align:start position:0%
and you know I just want to get my story
 
01:29:42.669 --> 01:29:42.679 align:start position:0%
out there and and have everyone see that
 
01:29:44.270 --> 01:29:44.280 align:start position:0%
you know this is happening people out
 
01:29:45.830 --> 01:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
there it's causing some veterans that
 
01:29:48.350 --> 01:29:48.360 align:start position:0%
have post-traumatic stress from uh being
 
01:29:50.629 --> 01:29:50.639 align:start position:0%
in combat they come home and all of a
 
01:29:52.430 --> 01:29:52.440 align:start position:0%
sudden now they're they're being ordered
 
01:29:55.229 --> 01:29:55.239 align:start position:0%
to pay all their income and you know
 
01:29:57.030 --> 01:29:57.040 align:start position:0%
it's the veteran Community you know
 
01:29:59.310 --> 01:29:59.320 align:start position:0%
there's even more suicides from that I
 
01:30:01.669 --> 01:30:01.679 align:start position:0%
know people that basically just give up
 
01:30:03.550 --> 01:30:03.560 align:start position:0%
on their kids they they they are
 
01:30:06.629 --> 01:30:06.639 align:start position:0%
exhausted so Mr sansy I
 
01:30:10.510 --> 01:30:10.520 align:start position:0%
I I I think you answered my question
 
01:30:14.709 --> 01:30:14.719 align:start position:0%
I what you're saying is that if this
 
01:30:18.310 --> 01:30:18.320 align:start position:0%
bill were to go through in your opinion
 
01:30:21.830 --> 01:30:21.840 align:start position:0%
the uh funding would be equal to your
 
01:30:25.270 --> 01:30:25.280 align:start position:0%
ex's and your uh funding is that what
 
01:30:29.229 --> 01:30:29.239 align:start position:0%
I'm hearing yes sir okay very good thank
 
01:30:31.470 --> 01:30:31.480 align:start position:0%
you and H representative horn you have
 
01:30:35.189 --> 01:30:35.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:38.109 --> 01:30:38.119 align:start position:0%
on uh thank you for your testimony sir I
 
01:30:40.109 --> 01:30:40.119 align:start position:0%
was wondering could you share me the ex
 
01:30:41.870 --> 01:30:41.880 align:start position:0%
could you share with us the explanation
 
01:30:45.390 --> 01:30:45.400 align:start position:0%
that you were given during the process
 
01:30:48.149 --> 01:30:48.159 align:start position:0%
where the state decided that only your X
 
01:30:50.830 --> 01:30:50.840 align:start position:0%
would be getting support if there's 50%
 
01:30:52.550 --> 01:30:52.560 align:start position:0%
custody I would think that means the
 
01:30:54.910 --> 01:30:54.920 align:start position:0%
support would be 50% as well yeah so I
 
01:30:57.470 --> 01:30:57.480 align:start position:0%
can I can explain that for you sir um
 
01:30:58.510 --> 01:30:58.520 align:start position:0%
again you got to bear with me for a
 
01:30:59.910 --> 01:30:59.920 align:start position:0%
second because it's kind of a I can
 
01:31:03.109 --> 01:31:03.119 align:start position:0%
speed up the story so um when I was
 
01:31:05.229 --> 01:31:05.239 align:start position:0%
going through this whole divorce process
 
01:31:07.350 --> 01:31:07.360 align:start position:0%
um I had no idea it was coming I love my
 
01:31:10.109 --> 01:31:10.119 align:start position:0%
spouse everything was solid uh and but
 
01:31:11.990 --> 01:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
we did you know argue from time to time
 
01:31:13.910 --> 01:31:13.920 align:start position:0%
and she would always say you know when

01:31:31.229 --> 01:31:31.239 align:start position:0%
I had no idea what happened I had no
 
01:31:33.510 --> 01:31:33.520 align:start position:0%

01:31:37.270 --> 01:31:37.280 align:start position:0%

day told them hey I have a restraining
 
01:31:42.629 --> 01:31:42.639 align:start position:0%
order on me uh and they immediately
 
01:31:45.390 --> 01:31:45.400 align:start position:0%
fired me because my my brother-in-law
 
01:31:47.270 --> 01:31:47.280 align:start position:0%
worked with me and they said you cannot
 
01:31:49.030 --> 01:31:49.040 align:start position:0%
be here with restraining order on you
 
01:31:50.990 --> 01:31:51.000 align:start position:0%
because it's against your your spouse
 
01:31:53.270 --> 01:31:53.280 align:start position:0%
and their immediate family members I was
 
01:31:55.870 --> 01:31:55.880 align:start position:0%
immediately fired for my job I lost my
 
01:31:57.590 --> 01:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
house I lost everything because I
 
01:31:59.709 --> 01:31:59.719 align:start position:0%
couldn't pay anymore I was only living
 
01:32:02.390 --> 01:32:02.400 align:start position:0%
off of my veterans disability I had
 
01:32:04.790 --> 01:32:04.800 align:start position:0%
multiple I had DCF investigations
 
01:32:08.550 --> 01:32:08.560 align:start position:0%
against me for uh child abuse I had uh
 
01:32:10.350 --> 01:32:10.360 align:start position:0%
police investigations for the same thing
 
01:32:12.310 --> 01:32:12.320 align:start position:0%
you name it my my spouse claimed
 
01:32:15.430 --> 01:32:15.440 align:start position:0%
everything possible against me I didn't
 
01:32:17.350 --> 01:32:17.360 align:start position:0%
have my kids I didn't have anything I
 
01:32:20.109 --> 01:32:20.119 align:start position:0%
agreed to do supervised visitation I
 
01:32:22.390 --> 01:32:22.400 align:start position:0%
agree to do anything to get there and be
 
01:32:24.350 --> 01:32:24.360 align:start position:0%
with my children and take care of them
 
01:32:26.709 --> 01:32:26.719 align:start position:0%
because they are my my life they're
 
01:32:29.470 --> 01:32:29.480 align:start position:0%
everything uh that I you know love and
 
01:32:32.950 --> 01:32:32.960 align:start position:0%
care for so I immediately lost
 
01:32:35.830 --> 01:32:35.840 align:start position:0%
everything I followed all the steps once
 
01:32:38.310 --> 01:32:38.320 align:start position:0%
Family Court uh they they she was
 
01:32:39.870 --> 01:32:39.880 align:start position:0%
claiming she wasn't getting any
 
01:32:42.590 --> 01:32:42.600 align:start position:0%
compensation from me but I I kept her on
 
01:32:44.629 --> 01:32:44.639 align:start position:0%
my bank account I kept giving her more
 
01:32:47.070 --> 01:32:47.080 align:start position:0%
than uh she was spending approximately
 
01:32:50.830 --> 01:32:50.840 align:start position:0%
$1,300 a month or more uh just accessing
 
01:32:52.950 --> 01:32:52.960 align:start position:0%
the account and then the court went well
 
01:32:55.550 --> 01:32:55.560 align:start position:0%
we want to start uh and this is while I
 
01:32:58.830 --> 01:32:58.840 align:start position:0%
was still being uh evaluated for child
 
01:33:00.590 --> 01:33:00.600 align:start position:0%
abuse if that was actually happening or
 
01:33:02.750 --> 01:33:02.760 align:start position:0%
not uh they ordered me to pay child
 
01:33:05.950 --> 01:33:05.960 align:start position:0%
support uh my my spouse's attorney said
 
01:33:07.870 --> 01:33:07.880 align:start position:0%
that I was working full-time still even
 
01:33:10.550 --> 01:33:10.560 align:start position:0%
though I've been fired uh they said that
 
01:33:12.990 --> 01:33:13.000 align:start position:0%
I was receiving more money than I was in
 
01:33:14.750 --> 01:33:14.760 align:start position:0%
disability and then they claimed that I
 
01:33:17.350 --> 01:33:17.360 align:start position:0%
was making more in other veterans
 
01:33:20.109 --> 01:33:20.119 align:start position:0%
benefits while I went to school all of
 
01:33:24.270 --> 01:33:24.280 align:start position:0%
this was untrue and I didn't have my
 
01:33:26.629 --> 01:33:26.639 align:start position:0%
children I I still haven't finalized my
 
01:33:28.510 --> 01:33:28.520 align:start position:0%
divorce yet because there's been a
 
01:33:30.310 --> 01:33:30.320 align:start position:0%
second investigation all of these
 
01:33:32.270 --> 01:33:32.280 align:start position:0%
investigations of child abuse that have
 
01:33:34.189 --> 01:33:34.199 align:start position:0%
been used and weaponized against me to
 
01:33:37.310 --> 01:33:37.320 align:start position:0%
hurt me all claimed uh they were all
 
01:33:40.910 --> 01:33:40.920 align:start position:0%
thrown out uh there was no abuse and the
 
01:33:42.870 --> 01:33:42.880 align:start position:0%
the court they said the children should
 
01:33:45.270 --> 01:33:45.280 align:start position:0%
be living with uh their father and they
 
01:33:47.950 --> 01:33:47.960 align:start position:0%
changed their legal residence to my
 
01:33:50.189 --> 01:33:50.199 align:start position:0%
house so I went from being an accused
 
01:33:53.430 --> 01:33:53.440 align:start position:0%
abuser to Legal residence with me half
 
01:33:55.149 --> 01:33:55.159 align:start position:0%
the time with her mom half the time with
 
01:33:58.350 --> 01:33:58.360 align:start position:0%
me and it's been a nightmare uh like uh
 
01:34:01.310 --> 01:34:01.320 align:start position:0%
the other uh person uh Mora Ryan who
 
01:34:04.669 --> 01:34:04.679 align:start position:0%
gave testimony about um co-parenting it
 
01:34:07.430 --> 01:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
is very difficult but at that time when
 
01:34:09.310 --> 01:34:09.320 align:start position:0%
they issued this order I didn't have my
 
01:34:11.070 --> 01:34:11.080 align:start position:0%
children they hadn't corrected it and
 
01:34:14.270 --> 01:34:14.280 align:start position:0%
still to this day now I'm only receiving
 
01:34:17.270 --> 01:34:17.280 align:start position:0%
my veterans disability as income nothing
 
01:34:18.990 --> 01:34:19.000 align:start position:0%
else and they are saying that is a
 
01:34:22.189 --> 01:34:22.199 align:start position:0%
pension we and uh you need to pay and
 
01:34:24.229 --> 01:34:24.239 align:start position:0%
again my my spouse is receiving those
 
01:34:26.390 --> 01:34:26.400 align:start position:0%
state benefits she's working full-time
 
01:34:28.550 --> 01:34:28.560 align:start position:0%
she's getting me to pay her and it
 
01:34:32.229 --> 01:34:32.239 align:start position:0%
leaves me financially strained exhausted
 
01:34:34.950 --> 01:34:34.960 align:start position:0%
I have to take care of myself I got
 
01:34:38.790 --> 01:34:38.800 align:start position:0%
injured in combat overseas my my my body
 
01:34:42.590 --> 01:34:42.600 align:start position:0%
is in constant pain from this and um it
 
01:34:44.870 --> 01:34:44.880 align:start position:0%
leaves me you know at a disadvantage
 
01:34:47.189 --> 01:34:47.199 align:start position:0%
where I you know struggle to take care
 
01:34:49.910 --> 01:34:49.920 align:start position:0%
of myself and you know how am I going to
 
01:34:51.629 --> 01:34:51.639 align:start position:0%
continue to provide for these children
 
01:34:54.830 --> 01:34:54.840 align:start position:0%
where they're taking 60% of my income
 
01:34:58.149 --> 01:34:58.159 align:start position:0%
and this this process uh for of a
 
01:34:59.990 --> 01:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
portion Min is supposed to be followed
 
01:35:03.830 --> 01:35:03.840 align:start position:0%
for situations like this and
 
01:35:06.350 --> 01:35:06.360 align:start position:0%
um that so so I think I answered your
 
01:35:09.390 --> 01:35:09.400 align:start position:0%
question as to why was was issued
 
01:35:11.430 --> 01:35:11.440 align:start position:0%
because it was as these investigations
 
01:35:14.310 --> 01:35:14.320 align:start position:0%
were going on but now even as a proven
 
01:35:15.870 --> 01:35:15.880 align:start position:0%
that I'm a good father I never did
 
01:35:18.030 --> 01:35:18.040 align:start position:0%
anything the things she said I'm still
 
01:35:20.629 --> 01:35:20.639 align:start position:0%
being forced to pay and I have the kids
 
01:35:22.910 --> 01:35:22.920 align:start position:0%
with me 15 out of 30 days it doesn't
 
01:35:24.510 --> 01:35:24.520 align:start position:0%
make any sense to me
 
01:35:27.149 --> 01:35:27.159 align:start position:0%
but this would correct that this would
 
01:35:29.310 --> 01:35:29.320 align:start position:0%
be able to allow me to go back into
 
01:35:32.669 --> 01:35:32.679 align:start position:0%
family court and go hey guys this is the
 
01:35:34.590 --> 01:35:34.600 align:start position:0%
apportionment process this is what needs
 
01:35:37.189 --> 01:35:37.199 align:start position:0%
to be followed and and the VA would
 
01:35:40.030 --> 01:35:40.040 align:start position:0%
determine uh you know the they would
 
01:35:42.910 --> 01:35:42.920 align:start position:0%
actually send the payment directly to my
 
01:35:44.350 --> 01:35:44.360 align:start position:0%
spouse if any of the money was
 
01:35:46.950 --> 01:35:46.960 align:start position:0%
determined to go to her so they would
 
01:35:48.950 --> 01:35:48.960 align:start position:0%
they would handle that all and it's just
 
01:35:48.960 --> 01:35:51.109 align:start position:0%
they would handle that all and it's just
being

01:35:51.109 --> 01:35:51.119 align:start position:0%
being
 
01:35:53.390 --> 01:35:53.400 align:start position:0%

01:39:41.870 --> 01:39:41.880 align:start position:0%
itself outside of being a soldier I'm a
 
01:39:44.750 --> 01:39:44.760 align:start position:0%
loving father to two beautiful girls one
 
01:39:48.030 --> 01:39:48.040 align:start position:0%
of which I have 5050 custody
 
01:39:50.550 --> 01:39:50.560 align:start position:0%
of unfortunately the state of New
 
01:39:51.990 --> 01:39:52.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has been including my
 
01:39:54.310 --> 01:39:54.320 align:start position:0%
disability compensation in my child
 
01:39:56.950 --> 01:39:56.960 align:start position:0%
support calculations leaving me
 
01:39:58.790 --> 01:39:58.800 align:start position:0%
struggling to pull myself out of a
 
01:40:01.350 --> 01:40:01.360 align:start position:0%
NeverEnding mountain of debt this
 
01:40:04.709 --> 01:40:04.719 align:start position:0%
violates Federal IM
 
01:40:07.149 --> 01:40:07.159 align:start position:0%
98-03 and I have been stripped of my
 
01:40:10.629 --> 01:40:10.639 align:start position:0%
right to doe process to argue this clear
 
01:40:13.870 --> 01:40:13.880 align:start position:0%
violation my inability to work and job
 
01:40:16.030 --> 01:40:16.040 align:start position:0%
limitations required me to collect
 
01:40:19.310 --> 01:40:19.320 align:start position:0%
Social Security to help pay my bills I
 
01:40:23.430 --> 01:40:23.440 align:start position:0%
now receive 400 $411
 
01:40:26.550 --> 01:40:26.560 align:start position:0%
a month after
 
01:40:29.510 --> 01:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
$1,275 a month in child support is taken
 
01:40:32.750 --> 01:40:32.760 align:start position:0%
from me my mortgage and truck payments
 
01:40:35.870 --> 01:40:35.880 align:start position:0%
are tripled this amount until this
 
01:40:39.030 --> 01:40:39.040 align:start position:0%
crippling and illegal action is stopped
 
01:40:41.270 --> 01:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
myself as well as many other veterans
 
01:40:44.310 --> 01:40:44.320 align:start position:0%
will be forced to continue to choose
 
01:40:46.189 --> 01:40:46.199 align:start position:0%
between paying our bills and taking care
 
01:40:51.270 --> 01:40:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:54.149 --> 01:40:54.159 align:start position:0%
children so I ask people of the
 
01:40:57.149 --> 01:40:57.159 align:start position:0%
committee to please pass
 
01:41:03.629 --> 01:41:03.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:08.910 --> 01:41:08.920 align:start position:0%
years and as far as veteran suicide uh
 
01:41:13.229 --> 01:41:13.239 align:start position:0%
just last week I had a father of five in
 
01:41:17.390 --> 01:41:17.400 align:start position:0%
my town that I live in commit suicide
 
01:41:19.669 --> 01:41:19.679 align:start position:0%
because he was denied access to his
 
01:41:22.390 --> 01:41:22.400 align:start position:0%
children and he couldn't afford an an
 
01:41:22.400 --> 01:41:24.550 align:start position:0%
children and he couldn't afford an an
attorney

01:41:24.550 --> 01:41:24.560 align:start position:0%
attorney
 
01:41:30.430 --> 01:41:30.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:34.030 --> 01:41:34.040 align:start position:0%
kids and this is a cold fact that a lot
 
01:41:35.669 --> 01:41:35.679 align:start position:0%
of veterans
 
01:41:38.950 --> 01:41:38.960 align:start position:0%
face is yes these programs are provided
 
01:41:40.709 --> 01:41:40.719 align:start position:0%
for lowincome
 
01:41:43.790 --> 01:41:43.800 align:start position:0%
veterans but when you
 
01:41:49.310 --> 01:41:49.320 align:start position:0%
have almost $1,300 a month in your only
 
01:41:52.310 --> 01:41:52.320 align:start position:0%
income that you have taken out for child
 
01:41:52.320 --> 01:41:54.070 align:start position:0%
income that you have taken out for child
support

01:41:54.070 --> 01:41:54.080 align:start position:0%
support
 
01:41:57.990 --> 01:41:58.000 align:start position:0%
in living how are you going to be able
 
01:42:00.390 --> 01:42:00.400 align:start position:0%
to afford an attorney to represent
 
01:42:02.189 --> 01:42:02.199 align:start position:0%
yourself to make sure you're getting the
 
01:42:04.350 --> 01:42:04.360 align:start position:0%
time that you need with your children
 
01:42:11.189 --> 01:42:11.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:15.629 --> 01:42:15.639 align:start position:0%
you um and that's all I have to say if
 
01:42:19.149 --> 01:42:19.159 align:start position:0%
anyone has any questions I am available
 
01:42:25.470 --> 01:42:25.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:28.030 --> 01:42:28.040 align:start position:0%
does anybody have any questions I don't
 
01:42:30.709 --> 01:42:30.719 align:start position:0%
see any hands up here thank thank you Mr
 
01:42:38.589 --> 01:42:38.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:41.470 --> 01:42:41.480 align:start position:0%
testimony uh next next on the list I
 
01:42:43.950 --> 01:42:43.960 align:start position:0%
have uh Tim
 
01:42:48.350 --> 01:42:48.360 align:start position:0%
penac just a moment I did see him
 
01:42:50.990 --> 01:42:51.000 align:start position:0%
earlier all right here he is just one
 
01:43:07.350 --> 01:43:07.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:10.350 --> 01:43:10.360 align:start position:0%
Mr penac are you there I am um thank you
 
01:43:11.510 --> 01:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
chairman long and thank you the
 
01:43:13.149 --> 01:43:13.159 align:start position:0%
committee for uh listening to my
 
01:43:16.030 --> 01:43:16.040 align:start position:0%
testimony um I also am a disabled
 
01:43:20.709 --> 01:43:20.719 align:start position:0%
veteran um and uh my disability is
 
01:43:24.390 --> 01:43:24.400 align:start position:0%
counted as a portion of of child support
 
01:43:26.149 --> 01:43:26.159 align:start position:0%
um and I'm in the same situation as the
 
01:43:28.350 --> 01:43:28.360 align:start position:0%
other veterans um I want to point out a
 
01:43:29.629 --> 01:43:29.639 align:start position:0%
couple of things that came up in the
 
01:43:33.350 --> 01:43:33.360 align:start position:0%
testimony during the day um so far um
 
01:43:36.270 --> 01:43:36.280 align:start position:0%
first of all im9
 
01:43:39.910 --> 01:43:39.920 align:start position:0%
98-03 is the information memorandum that
 
01:43:45.390 --> 01:43:45.400 align:start position:0%
falls underneath us code 38 USC
 
01:43:48.669 --> 01:43:48.679 align:start position:0%
5307 so in the earlier testimony by Mora
 
01:43:50.149 --> 01:43:50.159 align:start position:0%
Ryan she said it's an information
 
01:43:53.109 --> 01:43:53.119 align:start position:0%
memorandum it is simply the process
 
01:43:55.390 --> 01:43:55.400 align:start position:0%
outlined by the Veterans Administration
 
01:43:59.790 --> 01:43:59.800 align:start position:0%
under the veterans under the law USC
 
01:44:04.629 --> 01:44:04.639 align:start position:0%
5307 I am 9803 is just the process so
 
01:44:07.750 --> 01:44:07.760 align:start position:0%
there is a federal law calling for aor
 
01:44:10.950 --> 01:44:10.960 align:start position:0%
apportionment for the for the funds and
 
01:44:13.229 --> 01:44:13.239 align:start position:0%
as my other fellow veterans have stated
 
01:44:14.910 --> 01:44:14.920 align:start position:0%
the state is not following that
 
01:44:18.589 --> 01:44:18.599 align:start position:0%
process um in representative horn made
 
01:44:20.550 --> 01:44:20.560 align:start position:0%
an earlier comment regarding regarding
 
01:44:23.390 --> 01:44:23.400 align:start position:0%
the apportionment process a lot of this
 
01:44:27.709 --> 01:44:27.719 align:start position:0%
alludes to HB 362 I was present when U
 
01:44:30.310 --> 01:44:30.320 align:start position:0%
the Casey Center presented um the latest
 
01:44:32.430 --> 01:44:32.440 align:start position:0%
report and there's a discussion I know
 
01:44:35.430 --> 01:44:35.440 align:start position:0%
that this is this is um in in research
 
01:44:38.830 --> 01:44:38.840 align:start position:0%
or uh in study regarding
 
01:44:42.030 --> 01:44:42.040 align:start position:0%
362 what we are asking as veterans is
 
01:44:45.189 --> 01:44:45.199 align:start position:0%
simply for the state to follow the
 
01:44:47.470 --> 01:44:47.480 align:start position:0%
federal guidelines and laws as it
 
01:44:51.550 --> 01:44:51.560 align:start position:0%
relates to our disability compensation
 
01:44:53.070 --> 01:44:53.080 align:start position:0%
that's all we're asking as a state to do
 
01:44:55.709 --> 01:44:55.719 align:start position:0%
do that we're not asking to take money
 
01:44:59.350 --> 01:44:59.360 align:start position:0%
away we're not this money is not a
 
01:45:02.030 --> 01:45:02.040 align:start position:0%
portion of this money is allocated and
 
01:45:04.390 --> 01:45:04.400 align:start position:0%
you can pull go to the VA website and
 
01:45:06.149 --> 01:45:06.159 align:start position:0%
they actually have the schedule and you
 
01:45:08.430 --> 01:45:08.440 align:start position:0%
can look to see how much compensation
 
01:45:10.030 --> 01:45:10.040 align:start position:0%
you get on what percentage you can see
 
01:45:12.189 --> 01:45:12.199 align:start position:0%
how much money that if you have one
 
01:45:14.229 --> 01:45:14.239 align:start position:0%
child or two or three or four I have
 
01:45:16.350 --> 01:45:16.360 align:start position:0%
four children I have my children half
 
01:45:19.510 --> 01:45:19.520 align:start position:0%
the time all that is public knowledge
 
01:45:21.870 --> 01:45:21.880 align:start position:0%
and part of that money is allocated
 
01:45:23.709 --> 01:45:23.719 align:start position:0%
toward them and the portion process
 
01:45:26.669 --> 01:45:26.679 align:start position:0%
allocates that money to those for the
 
01:45:29.229 --> 01:45:29.239 align:start position:0%
children now the question about how much
 
01:45:32.790 --> 01:45:32.800 align:start position:0%
of that gets allocated in split between
 
01:45:35.589 --> 01:45:35.599 align:start position:0%
both parents if you have 50/50
 
01:45:37.790 --> 01:45:37.800 align:start position:0%
custody that's an issue that's in front
 
01:45:41.270 --> 01:45:41.280 align:start position:0%
of this committee ref regarding HB
 
01:45:44.149 --> 01:45:44.159 align:start position:0%
362 but the federal government is
 
01:45:45.589 --> 01:45:45.599 align:start position:0%
looking at this the VA process is
 
01:45:46.830 --> 01:45:46.840 align:start position:0%
looking at this and
 
01:45:49.109 --> 01:45:49.119 align:start position:0%
saying we will take care of the
 
01:45:52.510 --> 01:45:52.520 align:start position:0%
apportionment for the VA money I hate to
 
01:45:54.430 --> 01:45:54.440 align:start position:0%
say it but they're doing a part of the
 
01:45:56.669 --> 01:45:56.679 align:start position:0%
responsibility that we're not doing in
 
01:45:56.679 --> 01:45:57.430 align:start position:0%
responsibility that we're not doing in
this

01:45:57.430 --> 01:45:57.440 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:46:00.189 --> 01:46:00.199 align:start position:0%
state and that's what 362 is about so
 
01:46:02.390 --> 01:46:02.400 align:start position:0%
all we're asking as veterans who have
 
01:46:04.990 --> 01:46:05.000 align:start position:0%
served our country and have been injured
 
01:46:08.229 --> 01:46:08.239 align:start position:0%
is you just follow the law and follow
 
01:46:11.030 --> 01:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
the follow VA law that VA regulations
 
01:46:15.109 --> 01:46:15.119 align:start position:0%
that's all happy to take questions from
 
01:46:18.790 --> 01:46:18.800 align:start position:0%
there thank you Mr uh Pak uh are there
 
01:46:18.800 --> 01:46:21.030 align:start position:0%
there thank you Mr uh Pak uh are there
any

01:46:21.030 --> 01:46:21.040 align:start position:0%
any
 
01:46:24.990 --> 01:46:25.000 align:start position:0%
questions I I don't see any
 
01:46:30.390 --> 01:46:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:33.030 --> 01:46:33.040 align:start position:0%
penac next I'll
 
01:46:37.229 --> 01:46:37.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:41.870 --> 01:46:41.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:44.870 --> 01:46:44.880 align:start position:0%
look it looks like representative hor
 
01:46:47.350 --> 01:46:47.360 align:start position:0%
does have a question representative H
 
01:46:50.189 --> 01:46:50.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:53.070 --> 01:46:53.080 align:start position:0%
question uh I would like to offer two
 
01:46:55.149 --> 01:46:55.159 align:start position:0%
pieces of advice which may speed up this
 
01:46:59.030 --> 01:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
process the first piece of advice is if
 
01:47:00.950 --> 01:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
uh Miss Dyer is running from the same
 
01:47:02.830 --> 01:47:02.840 align:start position:0%
list that is in front of you perhaps she
 
01:47:05.990 --> 01:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
can have the person speaking in the
 
01:47:08.310 --> 01:47:08.320 align:start position:0%
lobby and then bring the next person on
 
01:47:10.510 --> 01:47:10.520 align:start position:0%
the list who is speaking into the lobby
 
01:47:12.470 --> 01:47:12.480 align:start position:0%
and keep them muted so that we don't
 
01:47:14.750 --> 01:47:14.760 align:start position:0%
have to continually wait for somebody to
 
01:47:17.030 --> 01:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
search through a list and the second
 
01:47:19.350 --> 01:47:19.360 align:start position:0%
piece is I would really appreciate if
 
01:47:21.910 --> 01:47:21.920 align:start position:0%
our microphones were under our control
 
01:47:25.510 --> 01:47:25.520 align:start position:0%
because I think we're all able to decide
 
01:47:27.629 --> 01:47:27.639 align:start position:0%
whether or not we can mute or unmute
 
01:47:30.470 --> 01:47:30.480 align:start position:0%
ourselves um if a dog starts barking
 
01:47:32.790 --> 01:47:32.800 align:start position:0%
Shir go ahead and mute somebody but it's
 
01:47:35.109 --> 01:47:35.119 align:start position:0%
just very limiting and I'm not very
 
01:47:40.430 --> 01:47:40.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:43.470 --> 01:47:43.480 align:start position:0%
good is Mr uh

01:48:33.310 --> 01:48:33.320 align:start position:0%
tell you right now lying dead on that
 
01:48:36.270 --> 01:48:36.280 align:start position:0%
ground is a cakewalk compared to what
 
01:48:38.990 --> 01:48:39.000 align:start position:0%

insurance I could I've gone to the court
 
01:49:36.790 --> 01:49:36.800 align:start position:0%
numerous times in regards to this issue
 
01:49:39.350 --> 01:49:39.360 align:start position:0%
and the judge looks at me laughs at me
 
01:49:41.910 --> 01:49:41.920 align:start position:0%
and says well figure something
 
01:49:46.430 --> 01:49:46.440 align:start position:0%

01:49:48.589 --> 01:49:48.599 align:start position:0%
finally got on my feet and got a
 
01:49:51.229 --> 01:49:51.239 align:start position:0%
one-bedroom apartment where my daughter
 
01:49:54.510 --> 01:49:54.520 align:start position:0%
was able to come in and actually have a
 
01:49:58.430 --> 01:49:58.440 align:start position:0%
bed to sleep in well my ex went to child
 
01:50:02.550 --> 01:50:02.560 align:start position:0%
services and stated that she didn't feel
 
01:50:06.790 --> 01:50:06.800 align:start position:0%
comfortable with just one bedroom so I
 
01:50:09.910 --> 01:50:09.920 align:start position:0%
get went from a $800 bedroom uh
 
01:50:13.390 --> 01:50:13.400 align:start position:0%
apartment to a $1,200 apartment and now
 
01:50:18.149 --> 01:50:18.159 align:start position:0%
if you think about it 800 minus 32 is um
 
01:50:19.589 --> 01:50:19.599 align:start position:0%
20 what
 
01:50:22.430 --> 01:50:22.440 align:start position:0%

support she I have
 
01:50:41.390 --> 01:50:41.400 align:start position:0%

I've had lawyers take my money and run
 
01:50:46.830 --> 01:50:46.840 align:start position:0%

don't have support up here like she
 
01:51:11.709 --> 01:51:11.719 align:start position:0%
lives at home with her parents she pays
 
01:51:15.510 --> 01:51:15.520 align:start position:0%
rentree she has a car she doesn't pay
 
01:51:19.669 --> 01:51:19.679 align:start position:0%
for food she makes $5,000 a month and
 
01:51:23.109 --> 01:51:23.119 align:start position:0%
yet we have 5050 custody this has killed
 
01:51:25.990 --> 01:51:26.000 align:start position:0%
me it
 
01:51:30.310 --> 01:51:30.320 align:start position:0%
has hurt me mentally I suffer from PTSD
 
01:51:32.669 --> 01:51:32.679 align:start position:0%
I suffer from traumatic brain injury
 
01:51:34.470 --> 01:51:34.480 align:start position:0%
I've had over 10
 
01:51:37.149 --> 01:51:37.159 align:start position:0%
surgeries um I can't
 
01:51:39.910 --> 01:51:39.920 align:start position:0%
work I can't stand up for more than an
 
01:51:41.430 --> 01:51:41.440 align:start position:0%
hour without being in
 
01:51:44.229 --> 01:51:44.239 align:start position:0%
pain and I've been it's been used
 
01:51:49.990 --> 01:51:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:53.790 --> 01:51:53.800 align:start position:0%
VA Li to what I can do and suppli for my
 
01:51:56.390 --> 01:51:56.400 align:start position:0%
daughter my daughter for Christmas I
 
01:52:00.270 --> 01:52:00.280 align:start position:0%
went through toys for Tops and I one
 
01:52:02.390 --> 01:52:02.400 align:start position:0%
thing that I heard through one of the
 
01:52:05.390 --> 01:52:05.400 align:start position:0%
testimonies this morning is
 
01:52:08.709 --> 01:52:08.719 align:start position:0%
that that one of the children get paid
 
01:52:12.629 --> 01:52:12.639 align:start position:0%
food uh at lunchtime at school well my I
 
01:52:16.030 --> 01:52:16.040 align:start position:0%
do that for my daughter at
 
01:52:16.040 --> 01:52:17.790 align:start position:0%
do that for my daughter at
times

01:52:17.790 --> 01:52:17.800 align:start position:0%
times
 
01:52:20.830 --> 01:52:20.840 align:start position:0%
and that is actually something that
 
01:52:24.470 --> 01:52:24.480 align:start position:0%
helps us all um and to not recognize
 
01:52:27.390 --> 01:52:27.400 align:start position:0%
that um is is kind of frustrating
 
01:52:30.270 --> 01:52:30.280 align:start position:0%
because veterans like us need that stuff
 
01:52:32.229 --> 01:52:32.239 align:start position:0%
and it's not a bad thing for kids to get
 
01:52:35.589 --> 01:52:35.599 align:start position:0%
it it's actually a good thing um I have
 
01:52:38.950 --> 01:52:38.960 align:start position:0%
5050 custody yeah
 
01:52:43.550 --> 01:52:43.560 align:start position:0%
I maybe see my da% of the time because
 
01:52:46.069 --> 01:52:46.079 align:start position:0%
of the fact that maybe I'm behind on
 
01:52:47.790 --> 01:52:47.800 align:start position:0%
child support I'm behind on child
 
01:52:50.229 --> 01:52:50.239 align:start position:0%
support because I'm paying $800 a month
 
01:52:53.229 --> 01:52:53.239 align:start position:0%
and my bills are I can't even cover my
 
01:52:55.589 --> 01:52:55.599 align:start position:0%
own bills I I put all my money towards
 
01:52:58.109 --> 01:52:58.119 align:start position:0%
my daughter I didn't get a stimulus
 
01:53:00.109 --> 01:53:00.119 align:start position:0%
check this year because I'm behind on
 
01:53:02.790 --> 01:53:02.800 align:start position:0%
child support and if you look at it
 
01:53:04.669 --> 01:53:04.679 align:start position:0%
people that didn't get stimulus checks
 
01:53:07.030 --> 01:53:07.040 align:start position:0%
this year were people who were behind on
 
01:53:09.709 --> 01:53:09.719 align:start position:0%
child support felons got them and people
 
01:53:12.030 --> 01:53:12.040 align:start position:0%
who were behind on child some good
 
01:53:14.870 --> 01:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
fathers who are there for the kids can't
 
01:53:18.669 --> 01:53:18.679 align:start position:0%
afford to pay in or late no matter what
 
01:53:21.030 --> 01:53:21.040 align:start position:0%
they do can't even get helped by the
 
01:53:23.510 --> 01:53:23.520 align:start position:0%
government um
 
01:53:26.910 --> 01:53:26.920 align:start position:0%
I try and I am the best father that I
 
01:53:31.030 --> 01:53:31.040 align:start position:0%
could be I am laughed at by the courts
 
01:53:34.430 --> 01:53:34.440 align:start position:0%
all the time my judge was actually just
 
01:53:37.189 --> 01:53:37.199 align:start position:0%
retired and she was forcibly retired
 
01:53:38.629 --> 01:53:38.639 align:start position:0%
because she was under
 
01:53:42.310 --> 01:53:42.320 align:start position:0%
investigation numerous times for false
 
01:53:45.149 --> 01:53:45.159 align:start position:0%
allegations in and being biased against
 
01:53:49.189 --> 01:53:49.199 align:start position:0%
men and when we brought this incident up
 
01:53:51.669 --> 01:53:51.679 align:start position:0%
about the child supports and the VA
 
01:53:54.270 --> 01:53:54.280 align:start position:0%
benefits she laughed at all of even my
 
01:53:56.870 --> 01:53:56.880 align:start position:0%
judge and said well you're gonna have to
 
01:53:58.390 --> 01:53:58.400 align:start position:0%
figure out a way to pay it because I
 
01:54:01.790 --> 01:54:01.800 align:start position:0%
don't care now that to me is something
 
01:54:04.830 --> 01:54:04.840 align:start position:0%
that is not right we keep fighting I'm
 
01:54:08.470 --> 01:54:08.480 align:start position:0%
not gonna keep fighting and it something
 
01:54:11.790 --> 01:54:11.800 align:start position:0%
needs to be done and I pray every day
 
01:54:14.390 --> 01:54:14.400 align:start position:0%
that I hope that this
 
01:54:17.510 --> 01:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
passes because not only will stop
 
01:54:20.350 --> 01:54:20.360 align:start position:0%
suicidal fathers but it will bring kids
 
01:54:23.669 --> 01:54:23.679 align:start position:0%
closer to their fathers and fathers are
 
01:54:25.550 --> 01:54:25.560 align:start position:0%
just as important as mothers money
 
01:54:28.790 --> 01:54:28.800 align:start position:0%
involved no money involved it matter
 
01:54:30.629 --> 01:54:30.639 align:start position:0%
fathers play the biggest one of the
 
01:54:32.910 --> 01:54:32.920 align:start position:0%
biggest roles in that kid's life
 
01:54:34.950 --> 01:54:34.960 align:start position:0%
daughters look up to fathers sons look
 
01:54:38.870 --> 01:54:38.880 align:start position:0%
up to fathers um and it it's frustrating
 
01:54:40.750 --> 01:54:40.760 align:start position:0%
to go around and see that people who
 
01:54:43.669 --> 01:54:43.679 align:start position:0%
fought for their country are
 
01:54:46.430 --> 01:54:46.440 align:start position:0%
continually being looked down upon the
 
01:54:49.229 --> 01:54:49.239 align:start position:0%
courts and it's all about money for
 
01:54:51.189 --> 01:54:51.199 align:start position:0%
their kids it's all about money you got
 
01:54:53.149 --> 01:54:53.159 align:start position:0%
to pay this you got to pay and when you
 
01:54:55.589 --> 01:54:55.599 align:start position:0%
can't you go to jail you can't pay your
 
01:54:58.709 --> 01:54:58.719 align:start position:0%
child support you go to jail and as a
 
01:55:01.910 --> 01:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
veteran that's not okay when a mother
 
01:55:05.069 --> 01:55:05.079 align:start position:0%
refuses to see her or refuses to follow
 
01:55:06.790 --> 01:55:06.800 align:start position:0%
the parenting plan of court or she gets
 
01:55:08.910 --> 01:55:08.920 align:start position:0%
a slap on the wrist or the Jud comes up
 
01:55:11.229 --> 01:55:11.239 align:start position:0%
with an excuse oh maybe because she was
 
01:55:13.950 --> 01:55:13.960 align:start position:0%
this way but when we miss a day in child
 
01:55:17.069 --> 01:55:17.079 align:start position:0%
support or mon in child support behind
 
01:55:19.750 --> 01:55:19.760 align:start position:0%
you go to jail and somebody said it
 
01:55:22.669 --> 01:55:22.679 align:start position:0%
after I believe it was at $5,000 you can
 
01:55:25.229 --> 01:55:25.239 align:start position:0%
file federal charges on them to me that
 
01:55:27.950 --> 01:55:27.960 align:start position:0%
is not okay when the government gives
 
01:55:31.589 --> 01:55:31.599 align:start position:0%
you only certain amount of money $200
 
01:55:35.830 --> 01:55:35.840 align:start position:0%
Max for a child and you have to pay
 
01:55:37.470 --> 01:55:37.480 align:start position:0%
almost three times two times much as
 
01:55:40.069 --> 01:55:40.079 align:start position:0%
that that's not okay and it puts the
 
01:55:42.589 --> 01:55:42.599 align:start position:0%
father and when the father can't pay it
 
01:55:44.790 --> 01:55:44.800 align:start position:0%
and then he can't pay his rent and then
 
01:55:47.669 --> 01:55:47.679 align:start position:0%
the other half ends up taking the child
 
01:55:48.709 --> 01:55:48.719 align:start position:0%
away because she doesn't feel
 
01:55:50.229 --> 01:55:50.239 align:start position:0%
comfortable because you can't find a
 
01:55:53.950 --> 01:55:53.960 align:start position:0%
place to live in that's not okay
 
01:55:57.790 --> 01:55:57.800 align:start position:0%
um I am very frustrated I am sorry that
 
01:56:00.589 --> 01:56:00.599 align:start position:0%
it's had to come to this I
 
01:56:03.790 --> 01:56:03.800 align:start position:0%
wish we could all work together to
 
01:56:07.229 --> 01:56:07.239 align:start position:0%
resolve this um I am a very devoted
 
01:56:10.189 --> 01:56:10.199 align:start position:0%
father devoted veteran Purple Heart
 
01:56:12.510 --> 01:56:12.520 align:start position:0%
veteran and it's something that I
 
01:56:14.830 --> 01:56:14.840 align:start position:0%
cherish and I want my daughter to grow
 
01:56:16.470 --> 01:56:16.480 align:start position:0%
up knowing that her father did
 
01:56:18.750 --> 01:56:18.760 align:start position:0%
everything in his power to make sure she
 
01:56:20.589 --> 01:56:20.599 align:start position:0%
had everything that she needed to
 
01:56:23.669 --> 01:56:23.679 align:start position:0%
survive in this world um and that's all
 
01:56:26.950 --> 01:56:26.960 align:start position:0%
I have to say thank you uh Mr brookshaw
 
01:56:29.950 --> 01:56:29.960 align:start position:0%

01:56:33.750 --> 01:56:33.760 align:start position:0%
frustration um uh there are a couple

thank you for uh hearing us today my
 
01:58:49.109 --> 01:58:49.119 align:start position:0%
name is Brenda town and I represent um a
 
01:58:53.270 --> 01:58:53.280 align:start position:0%
group of parents so I unwittingly got
 
01:58:55.629 --> 01:58:55.639 align:start position:0%
involved in helping parents about a year
 
01:59:00.229 --> 01:59:00.239 align:start position:0%
and a half ago and I uh I guess I lead a
 
01:59:01.430 --> 01:59:01.440 align:start position:0%
group of about
 
01:59:05.229 --> 01:59:05.239 align:start position:0%
3500 um folks that are participate on
 
01:59:09.390 --> 01:59:09.400 align:start position:0%
Facebook with um me and um this past
 
01:59:13.510 --> 01:59:13.520 align:start position:0%
year um we decided to get we decided to
 
01:59:15.550 --> 01:59:15.560 align:start position:0%
become unver virtual in meet for the
 
01:59:19.629 --> 01:59:19.639 align:start position:0%
first time and we had about 40 parents
 
01:59:22.149 --> 01:59:22.159 align:start position:0%
um uh fathers a few mothers but mostly
 
01:59:25.030 --> 01:59:25.040 align:start position:0%
fathers show up and of the 40 that
 
01:59:28.189 --> 01:59:28.199 align:start position:0%
showed up um I was shocked to find out
 
01:59:30.430 --> 01:59:30.440 align:start position:0%
that 20 of them were
 
01:59:33.669 --> 01:59:33.679 align:start position:0%
homeless and the majority of them were
 
01:59:37.030 --> 01:59:37.040 align:start position:0%
veterans and I I had no idea um what was
 
01:59:40.149 --> 01:59:40.159 align:start position:0%
happening and so as I fed phone calls
 
01:59:44.069 --> 01:59:44.079 align:start position:0%
daily and um emails and and messages I
 
01:59:45.629 --> 01:59:45.639 align:start position:0%
became really familiar with what was
 
01:59:49.229 --> 01:59:49.239 align:start position:0%
happening to this group of parents and
 
01:59:52.270 --> 01:59:52.280 align:start position:0%
what I came to find out is that these uh
 
01:59:55.550 --> 01:59:55.560 align:start position:0%
were disabled veterans and instead of
 
01:59:58.589 --> 01:59:58.599 align:start position:0%
having their disability pay that was
 
02:00:02.069 --> 02:00:02.079 align:start position:0%
supposed to be um separate um and it was
 
02:00:05.470 --> 02:00:05.480 align:start position:0%
separate based on the 38 USC
 
02:00:09.589 --> 02:00:09.599 align:start position:0%
5301a one um and not um included in
 
02:00:11.950 --> 02:00:11.960 align:start position:0%
child support calculations without
 
02:00:14.830 --> 02:00:14.840 align:start position:0%
exception all of them had had that
 
02:00:16.310 --> 02:00:16.320 align:start position:0%
happen to them while they were in family
 
02:00:18.830 --> 02:00:18.840 align:start position:0%
court and so the child support orders
 
02:00:22.510 --> 02:00:22.520 align:start position:0%
that were being issued were on um their
 
02:00:24.550 --> 02:00:24.560 align:start position:0%
disability and if they worked it would
 
02:00:26.390 --> 02:00:26.400 align:start position:0%
be a combination of their disability and
 
02:00:28.910 --> 02:00:28.920 align:start position:0%
their income and it was creating a
 
02:00:31.629 --> 02:00:31.639 align:start position:0%
tremendous hardship and making it
 
02:00:34.270 --> 02:00:34.280 align:start position:0%
impossible for them to maintain an
 
02:00:37.550 --> 02:00:37.560 align:start position:0%
apartment and pay the support as well as
 
02:00:40.030 --> 02:00:40.040 align:start position:0%
keep up with their medications and other
 
02:00:42.149 --> 02:00:42.159 align:start position:0%
things that um that were bills in their
 
02:00:44.790 --> 02:00:44.800 align:start position:0%
life and what I really came to
 
02:00:46.669 --> 02:00:46.679 align:start position:0%
understand is it was preventing them
 
02:00:48.629 --> 02:00:48.639 align:start position:0%
from being the dads that they really
 
02:00:50.709 --> 02:00:50.719 align:start position:0%
wanted to be um when you're living in
 
02:00:54.149 --> 02:00:54.159 align:start position:0%
your car and you're financially strapped
 
02:00:56.950 --> 02:00:56.960 align:start position:0%
you just can't be involved in your kids'
 
02:01:00.189 --> 02:01:00.199 align:start position:0%
life um the way that you want to be and
 
02:01:03.189 --> 02:01:03.199 align:start position:0%
so as the more I I came to understand
 
02:01:06.270 --> 02:01:06.280 align:start position:0%
that we as a state were not following
 
02:01:08.229 --> 02:01:08.239 align:start position:0%
these federal guidelines um the more
 
02:01:10.709 --> 02:01:10.719 align:start position:0%
passionate I got about this and I really
 
02:01:12.430 --> 02:01:12.440 align:start position:0%
wanted to get behind this bill and I
 
02:01:15.950 --> 02:01:15.960 align:start position:0%
hope you all do too because um there is
 
02:01:20.109 --> 02:01:20.119 align:start position:0%
a very clear defined Federal process
 
02:01:22.550 --> 02:01:22.560 align:start position:0%
that we as a state have have not been
 
02:01:25.910 --> 02:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
following and this process was designed
 
02:01:29.709 --> 02:01:29.719 align:start position:0%
to protect this group of people because
 
02:01:32.069 --> 02:01:32.079 align:start position:0%
of situations that go Way Beyond the
 
02:01:33.830 --> 02:01:33.840 align:start position:0%
scope of what we would typically
 
02:01:36.910 --> 02:01:36.920 align:start position:0%
consider in family courts and there is a
 
02:01:39.510 --> 02:01:39.520 align:start position:0%
reason why our federal government
 
02:01:43.189 --> 02:01:43.199 align:start position:0%
created this separation of veterans
 
02:01:45.430 --> 02:01:45.440 align:start position:0%
disability pay from other forms of
 
02:01:48.189 --> 02:01:48.199 align:start position:0%
compensation and they kept it unique so
 
02:01:50.510 --> 02:01:50.520 align:start position:0%
that these men and women who served
 
02:01:53.629 --> 02:01:53.639 align:start position:0%
would be protected and unfortunately we
 
02:01:55.589 --> 02:01:55.599 align:start position:0%
have failed them and we have failed them
 
02:01:57.550 --> 02:01:57.560 align:start position:0%
miserably and as you heard from the
 
02:02:00.550 --> 02:02:00.560 align:start position:0%
testimonies today this is huge issue
 
02:02:02.669 --> 02:02:02.679 align:start position:0%
that we are responsible for
 
02:02:05.990 --> 02:02:06.000 align:start position:0%
fixing so there is a an apportionment
 
02:02:08.669 --> 02:02:08.679 align:start position:0%
process that is laid out and U people
 
02:02:11.030 --> 02:02:11.040 align:start position:0%
have talked about it today the IM
 
02:02:14.870 --> 02:02:14.880 align:start position:0%
9803 that the V veterans administration
 
02:02:17.550 --> 02:02:17.560 align:start position:0%
will administer and based on an
 
02:02:20.189 --> 02:02:20.199 align:start position:0%
assessment of the households determine
 
02:02:22.350 --> 02:02:22.360 align:start position:0%
if some of that disability need needs to
 
02:02:24.350 --> 02:02:24.360 align:start position:0%
be balanced in other households and we
 
02:02:27.950 --> 02:02:27.960 align:start position:0%
need to let the VA do that and by doing
 
02:02:30.950 --> 02:02:30.960 align:start position:0%
that we help protect our veterans and we
 
02:02:33.229 --> 02:02:33.239 align:start position:0%
also balance the household so both
 
02:02:35.910 --> 02:02:35.920 align:start position:0%
parents can participate uh to the level
 
02:02:38.550 --> 02:02:38.560 align:start position:0%
that they need to participate the other
 
02:02:41.030 --> 02:02:41.040 align:start position:0%
thing that I I really am concerned about
 
02:02:44.550 --> 02:02:44.560 align:start position:0%
as a New Hampshire resident is that
 
02:02:47.669 --> 02:02:47.679 align:start position:0%
because we have been not following these
 
02:02:50.229 --> 02:02:50.239 align:start position:0%
federal laws we have
 
02:02:52.910 --> 02:02:52.920 align:start position:0%
inadvertently created an an
 
02:02:56.629 --> 02:02:56.639 align:start position:0%
inappropriate matching of title 4D funds
 
02:02:58.229 --> 02:02:58.239 align:start position:0%
that are being matched against these
 
02:03:01.270 --> 02:03:01.280 align:start position:0%
inflated child support orders and that
 
02:03:03.550 --> 02:03:03.560 align:start position:0%
could put us in really hot water and I
 
02:03:05.669 --> 02:03:05.679 align:start position:0%
wanted to flag that as well for the
 
02:03:07.870 --> 02:03:07.880 align:start position:0%
family committee because not only is
 
02:03:09.709 --> 02:03:09.719 align:start position:0%
this the federal law and the right thing
 
02:03:13.030 --> 02:03:13.040 align:start position:0%
to do but by us not following it um
 
02:03:16.629 --> 02:03:16.639 align:start position:0%
correctly it exposes us as well and so I
 
02:03:18.069 --> 02:03:18.079 align:start position:0%
think our hearts based on everything
 
02:03:19.830 --> 02:03:19.840 align:start position:0%
I've heard from uh people around the
 
02:03:22.149 --> 02:03:22.159 align:start position:0%
room we all want to support our vets so
 
02:03:25.990 --> 02:03:26.000 align:start position:0%
I just humbly ask you guys to um
 
02:03:29.390 --> 02:03:29.400 align:start position:0%
Institute the same um federal guidelines
 
02:03:32.229 --> 02:03:32.239 align:start position:0%
that are out there to be executed and
 
02:03:35.149 --> 02:03:35.159 align:start position:0%
embedded in the uh language of our um
 
02:03:37.430 --> 02:03:37.440 align:start position:0%
guidelines here in New Hampshire and
 
02:03:39.589 --> 02:03:39.599 align:start position:0%

02:03:41.229 --> 02:03:41.239 align:start position:0%
appreciate everything that you guys do I
 
02:03:43.069 --> 02:03:43.079 align:start position:0%
know you hear a lot of stuff uh coming
 
02:03:45.229 --> 02:03:45.239 align:start position:0%
at you all the time and it's a it's a
 
02:03:48.030 --> 02:03:48.040 align:start position:0%
lot of work but I I appreciate that
 
02:03:50.030 --> 02:03:50.040 align:start position:0%
you're you're listening today and that
 
02:03:52.030 --> 02:03:52.040 align:start position:0%
you stand in the Gap to fix some these
 
02:03:54.390 --> 02:03:54.400 align:start position:0%
holes for people that are hurting and
 
02:03:57.030 --> 02:03:57.040 align:start position:0%
I'd be glad to take any questions thank
 
02:03:59.270 --> 02:03:59.280 align:start position:0%
you Miss town uh I have a question from
 
02:03:59.280 --> 02:04:07.270 align:start position:0%
you Miss town uh I have a question from
representative

02:04:07.270 --> 02:04:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:10.990 --> 02:04:11.000 align:start position:0%
French yes thank you chair Mr chair and
 
02:04:13.830 --> 02:04:13.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my phone my
 
02:04:17.750 --> 02:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
question sorry Brenda um I've heard the
 
02:04:20.109 --> 02:04:20.119 align:start position:0%
term and it that there's an
 
02:04:22.750 --> 02:04:22.760 align:start position:0%
apportionment process
 
02:04:27.629 --> 02:04:27.639 align:start position:0%
um repeatedly this afternoon um Moira
 
02:04:30.310 --> 02:04:30.320 align:start position:0%
Ryan was talking about she's been
 
02:04:33.430 --> 02:04:33.440 align:start position:0%
waiting 10 years and several of the men
 
02:04:35.270 --> 02:04:35.280 align:start position:0%
have mentioned this
 
02:04:41.430 --> 02:04:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:46.669 --> 02:04:46.679 align:start position:0%
years in my um narrow experience it does
 
02:04:50.109 --> 02:04:50.119 align:start position:0%
not take years and um I believe some of
 
02:04:52.589 --> 02:04:52.599 align:start position:0%
the veterans who testified uh today
 
02:04:54.310 --> 02:04:54.320 align:start position:0%
might have seen other veterans go
 
02:04:57.310 --> 02:04:57.320 align:start position:0%
through the process I believe in some of
 
02:04:57.320 --> 02:04:58.069 align:start position:0%
through the process I believe in some of
the

02:04:58.069 --> 02:04:58.079 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:05:00.390 --> 02:05:00.400 align:start position:0%
documentation that is provided to the
 
02:05:02.589 --> 02:05:02.599 align:start position:0%
committee that they actually have
 
02:05:05.310 --> 02:05:05.320 align:start position:0%
examples of apportionments that went
 
02:05:07.109 --> 02:05:07.119 align:start position:0%
through the process and were closed in a
 
02:05:10.109 --> 02:05:10.119 align:start position:0%
timely manner so that you know it's a
 
02:05:12.229 --> 02:05:12.239 align:start position:0%
horrible thing that's that that has
 
02:05:15.669 --> 02:05:15.679 align:start position:0%
happened uh to um that the uh first
 
02:05:18.069 --> 02:05:18.079 align:start position:0%
person who testified today um and that
 
02:05:20.430 --> 02:05:20.440 align:start position:0%
shouldn't happen but it is not at least
 
02:05:23.589 --> 02:05:23.599 align:start position:0%
my experience or exposure um it should
 
02:05:26.709 --> 02:05:26.719 align:start position:0%
take about 15 days once the VA receives
 
02:05:28.470 --> 02:05:28.480 align:start position:0%
the paperwork that is what the
 
02:05:30.470 --> 02:05:30.480 align:start position:0%
commitment is on the bottom of the form
 
02:05:32.270 --> 02:05:32.280 align:start position:0%
that I
 
02:05:34.030 --> 02:05:34.040 align:start position:0%
have thank

up so I don't know if he needs to
 
02:06:22.239 --> 02:06:25.629 align:start position:0%
up so I don't know if he needs to
register

02:06:25.629 --> 02:06:25.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:30.669 --> 02:06:30.679 align:start position:0%
or do I call upon some people uh well
 
02:06:32.870 --> 02:06:32.880 align:start position:0%
why don't I call up Mr Frasier from uh
 
02:06:34.030 --> 02:06:34.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Department of Health and
 
02:06:37.149 --> 02:06:37.159 align:start position:0%
Human Services child support and then
 
02:06:39.709 --> 02:06:39.719 align:start position:0%
that's the last person I have listed and
 
02:06:42.270 --> 02:06:42.280 align:start position:0%
will'll ask if any member of the public
 
02:06:46.549 --> 02:06:46.559 align:start position:0%
uh who hasn't spoke uh speak
 
02:06:53.669 --> 02:06:53.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:56.709 --> 02:06:56.719 align:start position:0%
can you hear me he's muted there he goes
 
02:06:59.109 --> 02:06:59.119 align:start position:0%
okay uh thank you Mr chairman and
 
02:07:00.870 --> 02:07:00.880 align:start position:0%
members of the committee uh for the
 
02:07:04.109 --> 02:07:04.119 align:start position:0%
record my name is Tim Frasier um I
 
02:07:06.589 --> 02:07:06.599 align:start position:0%
council with uh the Bureau of Child
 
02:07:09.189 --> 02:07:09.199 align:start position:0%
Support Services as part of
 
02:07:13.149 --> 02:07:13.159 align:start position:0%
DHHS um and uh I first want to thank uh
 
02:07:16.430 --> 02:07:16.440 align:start position:0%
representative baldasaro uh for his
 
02:07:18.950 --> 02:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
service and his advocacy for veterans
 
02:07:21.669 --> 02:07:21.679 align:start position:0%
and uh the the veterans who have
 
02:07:24.069 --> 02:07:24.079 align:start position:0%
testified here today but unfortunately I
 
02:07:26.430 --> 02:07:26.440 align:start position:0%
do have to speak in opposition to this
 
02:07:32.470 --> 02:07:32.480 align:start position:0%
bill I it is really based on a basic
 
02:07:35.990 --> 02:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
misconception about federal law um and
 
02:07:39.709 --> 02:07:39.719 align:start position:0%
I'll try to tackle that first uh which
 
02:07:42.870 --> 02:07:42.880 align:start position:0%
is concerning the apportionment
 
02:07:46.109 --> 02:07:46.119 align:start position:0%
process the apportionment process that's
 
02:07:49.510 --> 02:07:49.520 align:start position:0%
contained in federal law concerning VA
 
02:07:52.189 --> 02:07:52.199 align:start position:0%
benefits does not modify
 
02:07:55.830 --> 02:07:55.840 align:start position:0%
child support it is actually an
 
02:07:55.840 --> 02:07:57.430 align:start position:0%
child support it is actually an
enforcement

02:07:57.430 --> 02:07:57.440 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
02:08:01.510 --> 02:08:01.520 align:start position:0%
Tool uh if I can explain uh step back
 
02:08:02.709 --> 02:08:02.719 align:start position:0%
just a little
 
02:08:06.990 --> 02:08:07.000 align:start position:0%
bit Federal Law requires all forms of
 
02:08:09.149 --> 02:08:09.159 align:start position:0%
income to be included in the child
 
02:08:12.149 --> 02:08:12.159 align:start position:0%
support guidelines that's a requirement
 
02:08:15.470 --> 02:08:15.480 align:start position:0%
of every state plan for child support in
 
02:08:18.669 --> 02:08:18.679 align:start position:0%
order for State 4D or child support
 
02:08:22.109 --> 02:08:22.119 align:start position:0%
agencies to receive federal funding
 
02:08:25.950 --> 02:08:25.960 align:start position:0%
um and uh New Hampshire does in fact uh
 
02:08:29.030 --> 02:08:29.040 align:start position:0%
Define income gross income very broadly
 
02:08:31.149 --> 02:08:31.159 align:start position:0%
to conform to the federal
 
02:08:35.030 --> 02:08:35.040 align:start position:0%
requirements uh it includes all forms of
 
02:08:40.669 --> 02:08:40.679 align:start position:0%
income earned unearned uh wages uh
 
02:08:44.830 --> 02:08:44.840 align:start position:0%
commissions uh everything uh tips and
 
02:08:48.310 --> 02:08:48.320 align:start position:0%
all forms of uh of government uh
 
02:08:50.830 --> 02:08:50.840 align:start position:0%
benefits as well too including Social
 
02:08:54.669 --> 02:08:54.679 align:start position:0%
Security unemployment compensation and
 
02:08:56.990 --> 02:08:57.000 align:start position:0%
including veterans benefits including
 
02:08:59.669 --> 02:08:59.679 align:start position:0%
veterans disability benefits the reason
 
02:09:02.149 --> 02:09:02.159 align:start position:0%
for this is simple it's a matter of
 
02:09:04.870 --> 02:09:04.880 align:start position:0%
public policy when child support orders
 
02:09:07.790 --> 02:09:07.800 align:start position:0%
are determined the court has to be able
 
02:09:11.910 --> 02:09:11.920 align:start position:0%
to look at the entire picture uh it's
 
02:09:15.189 --> 02:09:15.199 align:start position:0%
got to be able to see exactly what it is
 
02:09:18.390 --> 02:09:18.400 align:start position:0%
and how uh all forms of income each
 
02:09:22.470 --> 02:09:22.480 align:start position:0%
party has how they live uh you know what
 
02:09:24.790 --> 02:09:24.800 align:start position:0%
sources they have and uh to be able to
 
02:09:28.030 --> 02:09:28.040 align:start position:0%
include that in the calculation of child
 
02:09:30.950 --> 02:09:30.960 align:start position:0%
support now the New Hampshire Supreme
 
02:09:34.189 --> 02:09:34.199 align:start position:0%
Court in Mr Bronstein's case recently
 
02:09:37.510 --> 02:09:37.520 align:start position:0%
confirmed that the inclusion of VA
 
02:09:39.510 --> 02:09:39.520 align:start position:0%
benefits and the calculation of Child
 
02:09:42.750 --> 02:09:42.760 align:start position:0%
Support is consistent with federal law
 
02:09:45.030 --> 02:09:45.040 align:start position:0%
uh it belongs there it must be
 
02:09:47.189 --> 02:09:47.199 align:start position:0%
considered in the determination of an
 
02:09:49.229 --> 02:09:49.239 align:start position:0%
appropriate child support
 
02:09:55.390 --> 02:09:55.400 align:start position:0%
order now VA disability benefits are a
 
02:09:59.390 --> 02:09:59.400 align:start position:0%
specially protected category of
 
02:10:03.030 --> 02:10:03.040 align:start position:0%
income where almost everything else
 
02:10:06.709 --> 02:10:06.719 align:start position:0%
wages even uh disability benefits
 
02:10:10.870 --> 02:10:10.880 align:start position:0%
through a social security are uh
 
02:10:13.950 --> 02:10:13.960 align:start position:0%
assignable U not assignable but they're
 
02:10:18.069 --> 02:10:18.079 align:start position:0%
attachable garnishable by uh wage
 
02:10:21.430 --> 02:10:21.440 align:start position:0%
assignment uh by child support uh for
 
02:10:23.910 --> 02:10:23.920 align:start position:0%
the payment of Child Support so if
 
02:10:26.229 --> 02:10:26.239 align:start position:0%
you're having ordinary income or even if
 
02:10:28.629 --> 02:10:28.639 align:start position:0%
you're on Social Security Disability a
 
02:10:31.229 --> 02:10:31.239 align:start position:0%
notice will go to that source of income
 
02:10:34.030 --> 02:10:34.040 align:start position:0%
and your child support will be paid
 
02:10:35.270 --> 02:10:35.280 align:start position:0%
through that
 
02:10:38.470 --> 02:10:38.480 align:start position:0%
garnishment federal law protects
 
02:10:40.669 --> 02:10:40.679 align:start position:0%
veterans disability benefits in a
 
02:10:43.549 --> 02:10:43.559 align:start position:0%
special way that is not
 
02:10:47.430 --> 02:10:47.440 align:start position:0%
allowed uh that is to protect the the
 
02:10:51.350 --> 02:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
veterans from creditors and others um in
 
02:10:53.990 --> 02:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
a special way Rec federal law
 
02:10:56.069 --> 02:10:56.079 align:start position:0%
recognizing that this is special
 
02:10:58.629 --> 02:10:58.639 align:start position:0%
circumstances these are disabled
 
02:11:01.669 --> 02:11:01.679 align:start position:0%
veterans uh that doesn't change in any
 
02:11:05.030 --> 02:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
way the underlying child support order
 
02:11:07.910 --> 02:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
that has to be determined on a caseby
 
02:11:12.310 --> 02:11:12.320 align:start position:0%
casee basis it only uh affects the way
 
02:11:15.669 --> 02:11:15.679 align:start position:0%
the child support order is
 
02:11:19.549 --> 02:11:19.559 align:start position:0%
enforced now VA benefits do include
 
02:11:21.790 --> 02:11:21.800 align:start position:0%
allocations generally include
 
02:11:25.750 --> 02:11:25.760 align:start position:0%
allocations for veterans children uh so
 
02:11:28.069 --> 02:11:28.079 align:start position:0%
those amounts are included
 
02:11:32.149 --> 02:11:32.159 align:start position:0%
in uh the the total award and those are
 
02:11:35.990 --> 02:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
paid directly to the disabled
 
02:11:40.270 --> 02:11:40.280 align:start position:0%
veteran now once those disability
 
02:11:42.950 --> 02:11:42.960 align:start position:0%
benefits have been paid to the veteran
 
02:11:45.549 --> 02:11:45.559 align:start position:0%
the brunstein case and other cases have
 
02:11:48.709 --> 02:11:48.719 align:start position:0%
have confirmed that courts can require
 
02:11:50.750 --> 02:11:50.760 align:start position:0%
that child support be paid out of those
 
02:11:50.760 --> 02:11:52.430 align:start position:0%
that child support be paid out of those
funds

02:11:52.430 --> 02:11:52.440 align:start position:0%
funds
 
02:11:55.910 --> 02:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
uh but they can't be uh directly
 
02:11:57.990 --> 02:11:58.000 align:start position:0%
garnished from the
 
02:12:01.149 --> 02:12:01.159 align:start position:0%
VA except through the apportionment
 
02:12:05.430 --> 02:12:05.440 align:start position:0%
process in cases where child support is
 
02:12:09.030 --> 02:12:09.040 align:start position:0%
not being paid where the veteran is not
 
02:12:11.470 --> 02:12:11.480 align:start position:0%
adequately supporting their
 
02:12:14.470 --> 02:12:14.480 align:start position:0%
children uh the VA said that's an
 
02:12:17.910 --> 02:12:17.920 align:start position:0%
exception part of our uh of our mission
 
02:12:20.350 --> 02:12:20.360 align:start position:0%
here is to not only support the veteran
 
02:12:22.990 --> 02:12:23.000 align:start position:0%
but also to support the veterans
 
02:12:25.790 --> 02:12:25.800 align:start position:0%
families there's the a door opens
 
02:12:28.669 --> 02:12:28.679 align:start position:0%
through the apportionment process where
 
02:12:33.270 --> 02:12:33.280 align:start position:0%
not the pay or but the paye can seek uh
 
02:12:36.510 --> 02:12:36.520 align:start position:0%
an apportionment of the VA disability
 
02:12:40.189 --> 02:12:40.199 align:start position:0%
benefits to gain access to what would
 
02:12:43.430 --> 02:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
otherwise not be directly
 
02:12:46.750 --> 02:12:46.760 align:start position:0%
garnishable that is the ement process it
 
02:12:49.510 --> 02:12:49.520 align:start position:0%
is not a redetermination of how much
 
02:12:51.790 --> 02:12:51.800 align:start position:0%
child support should be paid
 
02:12:54.910 --> 02:12:54.920 align:start position:0%
in any way that is the Court's job the
 
02:12:58.669 --> 02:12:58.679 align:start position:0%
va's job is to protect the veteran and
 
02:13:01.709 --> 02:13:01.719 align:start position:0%
to support the veteran and the family so
 
02:13:03.510 --> 02:13:03.520 align:start position:0%
that is the basic
 
02:13:06.390 --> 02:13:06.400 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding that is a little bit
 
02:13:08.830 --> 02:13:08.840 align:start position:0%
confusing uh when you first look at this
 
02:13:11.189 --> 02:13:11.199 align:start position:0%
but I I do understand where the veterans
 
02:13:13.470 --> 02:13:13.480 align:start position:0%
are coming from they see that there is
 
02:13:16.069 --> 02:13:16.079 align:start position:0%
an extra allocation for families in the
 
02:13:19.030 --> 02:13:19.040 align:start position:0%
veterans disability benefits and they're
 
02:13:21.470 --> 02:13:21.480 align:start position:0%
apparently thinking that by this
 
02:13:23.709 --> 02:13:23.719 align:start position:0%
apportionment process that will limit
 
02:13:26.549 --> 02:13:26.559 align:start position:0%
their child support liability to that
 
02:13:29.189 --> 02:13:29.199 align:start position:0%
amount but that is not the
 
02:13:32.950 --> 02:13:32.960 align:start position:0%
case uh the uh informational memorandum
 
02:13:36.830 --> 02:13:36.840 align:start position:0%
IM 9803 that keeps being referred to
 
02:13:39.030 --> 02:13:39.040 align:start position:0%
that is actually a federal office of
 
02:13:41.870 --> 02:13:41.880 align:start position:0%
Child Support informational memorandum
 
02:13:44.790 --> 02:13:44.800 align:start position:0%
to 4D agencies such as the Bureau of
 
02:13:46.430 --> 02:13:46.440 align:start position:0%
Child Support Services here in New
 
02:13:51.109 --> 02:13:51.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire describing how to access
 
02:13:53.109 --> 02:13:53.119 align:start position:0%
disability benefits being paid to
 
02:13:55.589 --> 02:13:55.599 align:start position:0%
veterans that wouldn't otherwise be
 
02:13:57.589 --> 02:13:57.599 align:start position:0%
accessible through this supportment
 
02:14:01.790 --> 02:14:01.800 align:start position:0%
process that is to help the payes who
 
02:14:04.870 --> 02:14:04.880 align:start position:0%
have a claim like uh Miss Ryan I believe
 
02:14:07.229 --> 02:14:07.239 align:start position:0%
it was who testified earlier who is
 
02:14:10.549 --> 02:14:10.559 align:start position:0%
seeking to directly gain access to uh
 
02:14:13.189 --> 02:14:13.199 align:start position:0%
the veterans disability benefits through
 
02:14:13.199 --> 02:14:14.790 align:start position:0%
the veterans disability benefits through
this

02:14:14.790 --> 02:14:14.800 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:14:18.350 --> 02:14:18.360 align:start position:0%
process so um unfortunately this bill is
 
02:14:21.149 --> 02:14:21.159 align:start position:0%
based on a basic misunderstanding
 
02:14:23.189 --> 02:14:23.199 align:start position:0%
of apportionment and the federal law
 
02:14:23.199 --> 02:14:24.229 align:start position:0%
of apportionment and the federal law
behind

02:14:24.229 --> 02:14:24.239 align:start position:0%
behind
 
02:14:28.350 --> 02:14:28.360 align:start position:0%
it uh and the consequence of this would
 
02:14:31.990 --> 02:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
be to put the state out of federal
 
02:14:35.229 --> 02:14:35.239 align:start position:0%
compliance in regard to what has to be
 
02:14:38.430 --> 02:14:38.440 align:start position:0%
included in consideration of income for
 
02:14:40.589 --> 02:14:40.599 align:start position:0%
child support calculation
 
02:14:43.030 --> 02:14:43.040 align:start position:0%
purposes and it really goes against the
 
02:14:43.040 --> 02:14:44.069 align:start position:0%
purposes and it really goes against the
public

02:14:44.069 --> 02:14:44.079 align:start position:0%
public
 
02:14:47.510 --> 02:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
policy of not only child support and the
 
02:14:49.109 --> 02:14:49.119 align:start position:0%
support of veterans families but also
 
02:14:51.790 --> 02:14:51.800 align:start position:0%
goes against the veterans Administration
 
02:14:53.750 --> 02:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
policy of supporting both the veteran
 
02:14:56.950 --> 02:14:56.960 align:start position:0%
and their families because if you take
 
02:14:59.750 --> 02:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
the amount of uh of the disability
 
02:15:02.629 --> 02:15:02.639 align:start position:0%
benefit out of the calculation as we
 
02:15:04.910 --> 02:15:04.920 align:start position:0%
have heard many of these Disabled Vets
 
02:15:07.069 --> 02:15:07.079 align:start position:0%
have little or no other
 
02:15:10.390 --> 02:15:10.400 align:start position:0%
income that would result in a
 
02:15:14.350 --> 02:15:14.360 align:start position:0%
$50 a month minimum order of child
 
02:15:17.229 --> 02:15:17.239 align:start position:0%
support and that would be the only
 
02:15:20.149 --> 02:15:20.159 align:start position:0%
obligation the vet would have to their
 
02:15:23.549 --> 02:15:23.559 align:start position:0%
families how many children uh the
 
02:15:26.229 --> 02:15:26.239 align:start position:0%
inevitable result of that would be that
 
02:15:30.030 --> 02:15:30.040 align:start position:0%
the families would have less support uh
 
02:15:34.350 --> 02:15:34.360 align:start position:0%
less ability to uh self on self-reliance
 
02:15:36.709 --> 02:15:36.719 align:start position:0%
economically uh they would be forced in
 
02:15:39.990 --> 02:15:40.000 align:start position:0%
many instances to seek public assistance
 
02:15:43.149 --> 02:15:43.159 align:start position:0%
and uh which the taxpayers have to pick
 
02:15:47.030 --> 02:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
up um that that's the unfortunate
 
02:15:52.750 --> 02:15:52.760 align:start position:0%
consequence of this um so uh I I respect
 
02:15:54.950 --> 02:15:54.960 align:start position:0%
the uh the efforts here I understand
 
02:15:58.109 --> 02:15:58.119 align:start position:0%
this is very well intentioned it is just
 
02:16:01.189 --> 02:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
not what the sponsors and the supporters
 
02:16:03.950 --> 02:16:03.960 align:start position:0%
believe it is uh and I'd be happy to
 
02:16:16.470 --> 02:16:16.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:20.229 --> 02:16:20.239 align:start position:0%
questions there we go thank you uh thank
 
02:16:22.790 --> 02:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
you Mr Fraser are there any uh questions
 
02:16:26.910 --> 02:16:26.920 align:start position:0%
from the and I do have questions
 
02:16:30.910 --> 02:16:30.920 align:start position:0%
uh representative uh pen city thank you
 
02:16:34.309 --> 02:16:34.319 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman um I'd like to ask
 
02:16:38.629 --> 02:16:38.639 align:start position:0%
um speaker if um under title four did
 
02:16:41.669 --> 02:16:41.679 align:start position:0%
the courts receive any extra funds based
 
02:16:43.990 --> 02:16:44.000 align:start position:0%
on the child support payments they
 
02:16:46.429 --> 02:16:46.439 align:start position:0%
receive not on the child support
 
02:16:49.150 --> 02:16:49.160 align:start position:0%
payments thank you for your question uh
 
02:16:54.389 --> 02:16:54.399 align:start position:0%
representative thank you the uh the 4D
 
02:16:58.389 --> 02:16:58.399 align:start position:0%
funding is for the support of the 4D
 
02:17:01.910 --> 02:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
program which is in New Hampshire the
 
02:17:04.790 --> 02:17:04.800 align:start position:0%
Bureau of Child Support Services um
 
02:17:08.389 --> 02:17:08.399 align:start position:0%
every state every territory and uh most
 
02:17:12.270 --> 02:17:12.280 align:start position:0%
Indian tribes actually have 4D programs
 
02:17:15.629 --> 02:17:15.639 align:start position:0%
uh because it's very much tied into uh
 
02:17:18.950 --> 02:17:18.960 align:start position:0%
the uh uh TANF program and so forth
 
02:17:20.469 --> 02:17:20.479 align:start position:0%
through reimbursement to the state and
 
02:17:23.270 --> 02:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
federal programs the uh the federal
 
02:17:26.429 --> 02:17:26.439 align:start position:0%
government supports child support as
 
02:17:30.230 --> 02:17:30.240 align:start position:0%
sort of the Keystone of that at a 66%
 
02:17:34.190 --> 02:17:34.200 align:start position:0%
rate so uh our the Bureau of Child
 
02:17:35.950 --> 02:17:35.960 align:start position:0%
Support Services in New Hampshire does
 
02:17:39.030 --> 02:17:39.040 align:start position:0%
receive 66% of its funding from the
 
02:17:42.469 --> 02:17:42.479 align:start position:0%
federal sources now also one of the
 
02:17:44.629 --> 02:17:44.639 align:start position:0%
requirements of every state plan of
 
02:17:47.990 --> 02:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
Child Support is that child support
 
02:17:49.910 --> 02:17:49.920 align:start position:0%
cases get special treatment in court
 
02:17:52.469 --> 02:17:52.479 align:start position:0%
they get what is called called expedited
 
02:17:55.870 --> 02:17:55.880 align:start position:0%
process in other words it has to go
 
02:17:59.230 --> 02:17:59.240 align:start position:0%
faster than ordinary cases uh because
 
02:18:00.870 --> 02:18:00.880 align:start position:0%
there are so many of them basically and
 
02:18:02.469 --> 02:18:02.479 align:start position:0%
they have to be done
 
02:18:08.030 --> 02:18:08.040 align:start position:0%
quickly uh so in that expedited process
 
02:18:11.990 --> 02:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
uh cases can't be heard by judges uh
 
02:18:13.910 --> 02:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
they have to be heard by judicial
 
02:18:18.830 --> 02:18:18.840 align:start position:0%
referees or marital Masters and that uh
 
02:18:21.830 --> 02:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
cost for the judges marital Masters and
 
02:18:26.110 --> 02:18:26.120 align:start position:0%
other court costs is 66% reimbursable
 
02:18:28.950 --> 02:18:28.960 align:start position:0%
through the 4D program in order to make
 
02:18:32.629 --> 02:18:32.639 align:start position:0%
it faster and support that Court program
 
02:18:34.870 --> 02:18:34.880 align:start position:0%
it has nothing to do with the amount of
 
02:18:37.190 --> 02:18:37.200 align:start position:0%
Child Support ordered and as a matter of
 
02:18:40.750 --> 02:18:40.760 align:start position:0%
fact what it has the the orders have to
 
02:18:43.790 --> 02:18:43.800 align:start position:0%
be compliant with all 4D regulations in
 
02:18:46.150 --> 02:18:46.160 align:start position:0%
other words they can't be excessive or
 
02:18:48.950 --> 02:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
outside the guidelines uh they have to
 
02:18:50.469 --> 02:18:50.479 align:start position:0%
be compliant with the guidelines in
 
02:18:54.070 --> 02:18:54.080 align:start position:0%
order to um be consistent with the
 
02:18:57.110 --> 02:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
program and and and receive the 66%
 
02:19:00.030 --> 02:19:00.040 align:start position:0%
funding so yes and no courts do get
 
02:19:04.309 --> 02:19:04.319 align:start position:0%
reimbursed for 4D cases but not for any
 
02:19:04.319 --> 02:19:11.110 align:start position:0%
reimbursed for 4D cases but not for any
particular

02:19:11.110 --> 02:19:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:14.589 --> 02:19:14.599 align:start position:0%
orders uh representative Corson you have
 
02:19:14.599 --> 02:19:19.509 align:start position:0%
orders uh representative Corson you have
a

02:19:19.509 --> 02:19:19.519 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:22.389 --> 02:19:22.399 align:start position:0%
question uh thank you uh thank you Mr
 
02:19:23.750 --> 02:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking the
 
02:19:26.389 --> 02:19:26.399 align:start position:0%
question Mr Fraser uh could you just
 
02:19:29.150 --> 02:19:29.160 align:start position:0%
explain again briefly how it is the
 
02:19:33.349 --> 02:19:33.359 align:start position:0%
present situation protects someone like
 
02:19:36.709 --> 02:19:36.719 align:start position:0%
Miss berer in her testimony you
 
02:19:38.270 --> 02:19:38.280 align:start position:0%
mentioned that quite clearly but I
 
02:19:40.790 --> 02:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
missed some of those details and I'd be
 
02:19:44.549 --> 02:19:44.559 align:start position:0%
helped by that thank you Miss Ryan is
 
02:19:44.559 --> 02:19:45.750 align:start position:0%
helped by that thank you Miss Ryan is
saying

02:19:45.750 --> 02:19:45.760 align:start position:0%
saying
 
02:19:50.070 --> 02:19:50.080 align:start position:0%
that uh as a disabled vet herself and uh
 
02:19:54.270 --> 02:19:54.280 align:start position:0%
and is seeking um to enforce child
 
02:19:57.550 --> 02:19:57.560 align:start position:0%
support against another disabled vet
 
02:20:02.710 --> 02:20:02.720 align:start position:0%
correct as the other parent uh she is
 
02:20:05.429 --> 02:20:05.439 align:start position:0%
accessing the apportionment
 
02:20:10.150 --> 02:20:10.160 align:start position:0%
process which is a request to the VA
 
02:20:13.349 --> 02:20:13.359 align:start position:0%
Administration to actually have some or
 
02:20:16.550 --> 02:20:16.560 align:start position:0%
all of the child support that is that
 
02:20:19.870 --> 02:20:19.880 align:start position:0%
the other parent is obligated to pay
 
02:20:23.110 --> 02:20:23.120 align:start position:0%
taken out of their VA benefits
 
02:20:26.349 --> 02:20:26.359 align:start position:0%
directly that is not otherwise available
 
02:20:29.309 --> 02:20:29.319 align:start position:0%
because of the way federal law works you
 
02:20:33.190 --> 02:20:33.200 align:start position:0%
can't directly garnish those VA benefits
 
02:20:36.270 --> 02:20:36.280 align:start position:0%
except through the apportionment process
 
02:20:38.950 --> 02:20:38.960 align:start position:0%
now that apportionment process does not
 
02:20:41.870 --> 02:20:41.880 align:start position:0%
alter the underlying child support order
 
02:20:44.309 --> 02:20:44.319 align:start position:0%
it doesn't limit the obligation of the
 
02:20:46.950 --> 02:20:46.960 align:start position:0%
veteran it just is a determination by
 
02:20:50.750 --> 02:20:50.760 align:start position:0%
the veterans administration of how much
 
02:20:54.710 --> 02:20:54.720 align:start position:0%
can if any should be taken out of the
 
02:20:57.030 --> 02:20:57.040 align:start position:0%
veterans disability benefits for the
 
02:20:59.230 --> 02:20:59.240 align:start position:0%
payment of support based on the
 
02:21:02.510 --> 02:21:02.520 align:start position:0%
application of the paye the one who was
 
02:21:07.710 --> 02:21:07.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:11.389 --> 02:21:11.399 align:start position:0%
support and uh and representative horn
 
02:21:16.190 --> 02:21:16.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:20.790 --> 02:21:20.800 align:start position:0%
question so there's no doubt that this
 
02:21:24.070 --> 02:21:24.080 align:start position:0%
process is not serving everybody equally
 
02:21:27.550 --> 02:21:27.560 align:start position:0%
we've heard plenty of testimony today
 
02:21:30.830 --> 02:21:30.840 align:start position:0%
that contributes to that that
 
02:21:33.630 --> 02:21:33.640 align:start position:0%
statement what I'm curious about more
 
02:21:37.590 --> 02:21:37.600 align:start position:0%
than anything else is how DHHS
 
02:21:41.389 --> 02:21:41.399 align:start position:0%
justifies leveraging a disability check
 
02:21:42.710 --> 02:21:42.720 align:start position:0%
for somebody
 
02:21:45.190 --> 02:21:45.200 align:start position:0%
who's getting that check because they
 
02:21:48.270 --> 02:21:48.280 align:start position:0%
can't work to the point where they're
 
02:21:50.150 --> 02:21:50.160 align:start position:0%
not able to provide a safe and stable
 
02:21:53.190 --> 02:21:53.200 align:start position:0%
environment for their for the kids
 
02:21:55.110 --> 02:21:55.120 align:start position:0%
receiving the child support wouldn't it
 
02:21:58.150 --> 02:21:58.160 align:start position:0%
make more sense to keep
 
02:22:01.110 --> 02:22:01.120 align:start position:0%
that child support disab wouldn't that
 
02:22:03.469 --> 02:22:03.479 align:start position:0%
be make more sense to keep disability
 
02:22:06.429 --> 02:22:06.439 align:start position:0%
separate from Child Support dues so that
 
02:22:08.510 --> 02:22:08.520 align:start position:0%
the disability would be used to provide
 
02:22:10.870 --> 02:22:10.880 align:start position:0%
for the
 
02:22:13.990 --> 02:22:14.000 align:start position:0%
children thank you representative horen
 
02:22:18.110 --> 02:22:18.120 align:start position:0%
uh that is really two separate
 
02:22:21.110 --> 02:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
issues uh DHHS the the Bureau of Child
 
02:22:23.950 --> 02:22:23.960 align:start position:0%
Support Services does not determine how
 
02:22:26.389 --> 02:22:26.399 align:start position:0%
much Someone's Child Support obligation
 
02:22:30.230 --> 02:22:30.240 align:start position:0%
should be that is the Court's job uh the
 
02:22:32.870 --> 02:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
Bureau of Child Support Services gets
 
02:22:34.990 --> 02:22:35.000 align:start position:0%
the orders and is obligated under the
 
02:22:38.070 --> 02:22:38.080 align:start position:0%
law to enforce to the best of our
 
02:22:42.070 --> 02:22:42.080 align:start position:0%
ability now through that process uh
 
02:22:44.550 --> 02:22:44.560 align:start position:0%
disability ordinary Social Security
 
02:22:47.469 --> 02:22:47.479 align:start position:0%
Disability is garnishable by income
 
02:22:50.190 --> 02:22:50.200 align:start position:0%
assignment it payment can come directly
 
02:22:52.230 --> 02:22:52.240 align:start position:0%
through through the income assignment
 
02:22:54.590 --> 02:22:54.600 align:start position:0%
but we can't determine whether that
 
02:22:57.110 --> 02:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
amount is fair or not to the person who
 
02:22:59.429 --> 02:22:59.439 align:start position:0%
is paying that's the courtz
 
02:23:02.630 --> 02:23:02.640 align:start position:0%
job uh and uh
 
02:23:06.670 --> 02:23:06.680 align:start position:0%
so uh we don't we enforce orders we
 
02:23:09.670 --> 02:23:09.680 align:start position:0%
don't create them the modification
 
02:23:13.230 --> 02:23:13.240 align:start position:0%
process is there for anybody who is not
 
02:23:16.389 --> 02:23:16.399 align:start position:0%
able to meet the payments they can apply
 
02:23:18.910 --> 02:23:18.920 align:start position:0%
to the court to try to get their order
 
02:23:18.920 --> 02:23:21.230 align:start position:0%
to the court to try to get their order
changed

02:23:21.230 --> 02:23:21.240 align:start position:0%
changed
 
02:23:23.790 --> 02:23:23.800 align:start position:0%
again that's a process that's out of our
 
02:23:26.910 --> 02:23:26.920 align:start position:0%
control but we do assist people in it if
 
02:23:29.269 --> 02:23:29.279 align:start position:0%
someone has a change of circumstance or
 
02:23:31.870 --> 02:23:31.880 align:start position:0%
three years have gone by they can simply
 
02:23:34.389 --> 02:23:34.399 align:start position:0%
ask us to help them get the case back
 
02:23:39.830 --> 02:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:42.630 --> 02:23:42.640 align:start position:0%
that uh representative
 
02:23:45.070 --> 02:23:45.080 align:start position:0%
rice oh I'm sorry representative horn
 
02:23:46.990 --> 02:23:47.000 align:start position:0%
has a followup go ahead representative
 
02:23:50.510 --> 02:23:50.520 align:start position:0%
horn thank you Mr chairman um I thought
 
02:23:51.870 --> 02:23:51.880 align:start position:0%
I heard you state when you began your
 
02:23:53.750 --> 02:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
testimony that you're in opposition to
 
02:23:55.230 --> 02:23:55.240 align:start position:0%
this bill so wouldn't that suggest
 
02:23:57.750 --> 02:23:57.760 align:start position:0%
you're taking a position that you have
 
02:23:59.469 --> 02:23:59.479 align:start position:0%
just now tried to say is the Court's
 
02:24:01.150 --> 02:24:01.160 align:start position:0%
position to
 
02:24:04.150 --> 02:24:04.160 align:start position:0%
take thank you Representative no I I I
 
02:24:06.630 --> 02:24:06.640 align:start position:0%
think I'm being consistent here uh we
 
02:24:08.790 --> 02:24:08.800 align:start position:0%
have to oppose this bill because the
 
02:24:11.309 --> 02:24:11.319 align:start position:0%
change it would make to the child
 
02:24:13.950 --> 02:24:13.960 align:start position:0%
support guidelines would put us out of
 
02:24:16.790 --> 02:24:16.800 align:start position:0%
compliance with the requirements of our
 
02:24:20.670 --> 02:24:20.680 align:start position:0%
state plan the state plan requires that
 
02:24:23.389 --> 02:24:23.399 align:start position:0%
all forms of income earned unearned
 
02:24:26.269 --> 02:24:26.279 align:start position:0%
disability and so on and so forth be
 
02:24:29.469 --> 02:24:29.479 align:start position:0%
included in consideration by the courts
 
02:24:31.070 --> 02:24:31.080 align:start position:0%
in the child support
 
02:24:34.389 --> 02:24:34.399 align:start position:0%
guidelines uh we don't we don't issue
 
02:24:36.349 --> 02:24:36.359 align:start position:0%
orders it's the court that issues the
 
02:24:41.750 --> 02:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:45.230 --> 02:24:45.240 align:start position:0%
guidelines representative rice thank you
 
02:24:47.429 --> 02:24:47.439 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman my question is actually for
 
02:24:49.790 --> 02:24:49.800 align:start position:0%
you do we have anyone here from the
 
02:24:51.870 --> 02:24:51.880 align:start position:0%
courts that could possibly answer some
 
02:24:54.349 --> 02:24:54.359 align:start position:0%
of these questions as to why we have
 
02:24:56.790 --> 02:24:56.800 align:start position:0%
veterans on the line who have put their
 
02:24:58.750 --> 02:24:58.760 align:start position:0%
lives on the line for our country and
 
02:25:02.469 --> 02:25:02.479 align:start position:0%
are homeless because of these guidelines
 
02:25:04.349 --> 02:25:04.359 align:start position:0%
where is the court I want to hear from
 
02:25:07.670 --> 02:25:07.680 align:start position:0%

02:25:48.510 --> 02:25:48.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:51.070 --> 02:25:51.080 align:start position:0%
m looks like he needs
 
02:25:55.190 --> 02:25:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:58.349 --> 02:25:58.359 align:start position:0%

feel much the same way but uh and this
 
02:26:05.870 --> 02:26:05.880 align:start position:0%
is is a question to
 
02:26:10.830 --> 02:26:10.840 align:start position:0%
uh uh to uh Mr Frasier um when you when
 
02:26:13.950 --> 02:26:13.960 align:start position:0%
you talk about the court and you talk
 
02:26:15.750 --> 02:26:15.760 align:start position:0%
about the
 
02:26:18.990 --> 02:26:19.000 align:start position:0%
plan isn't it the legislature that
 
02:26:20.950 --> 02:26:20.960 align:start position:0%
actually determined
 
02:26:24.030 --> 02:26:24.040 align:start position:0%
that plan and what the court can and
 
02:26:24.040 --> 02:26:26.230 align:start position:0%
that plan and what the court can and
cannot

02:26:26.230 --> 02:26:26.240 align:start position:0%
cannot
 
02:26:29.309 --> 02:26:29.319 align:start position:0%
do thank you representative Baran
 
02:26:33.429 --> 02:26:33.439 align:start position:0%
absolutely and the and the legislature
 
02:26:37.230 --> 02:26:37.240 align:start position:0%
has um implemented the child support
 
02:26:40.990 --> 02:26:41.000 align:start position:0%
guidelines um in compliance with the
 
02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:42.349 align:start position:0%
guidelines um in compliance with the
federal

02:26:42.349 --> 02:26:42.359 align:start position:0%
federal
 
02:26:45.510 --> 02:26:45.520 align:start position:0%
requirements um that's what the
 
02:26:48.269 --> 02:26:48.279 align:start position:0%
legislature has chosen to do and part of
 
02:26:51.870 --> 02:26:51.880 align:start position:0%
that of course is to keep the state
 
02:26:54.830 --> 02:26:54.840 align:start position:0%
consistent with the requirements uh the
 
02:26:56.870 --> 02:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
federal requirements of the state plan
 
02:26:59.990 --> 02:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
for child support um that is a
 
02:27:04.230 --> 02:27:04.240 align:start position:0%
prerequisite for the funding for both uh
 
02:27:06.670 --> 02:27:06.680 align:start position:0%
the child support the buau of Child
 
02:27:09.150 --> 02:27:09.160 align:start position:0%
Support Services and to a certain extent
 
02:27:11.389 --> 02:27:11.399 align:start position:0%
to the tanif program it's also reliant
 
02:27:13.990 --> 02:27:14.000 align:start position:0%
on compliance with the state plan for
 
02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:15.190 align:start position:0%
on compliance with the state plan for
child

02:27:15.190 --> 02:27:15.200 align:start position:0%
child
 
02:27:18.950 --> 02:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
support um so the legislature past
 
02:27:21.389 --> 02:27:21.399 align:start position:0%
legislatures have made the decision that
 
02:27:24.309 --> 02:27:24.319 align:start position:0%
this is important and to have a
 
02:27:26.269 --> 02:27:26.279 align:start position:0%
functioning Bureau of Child Support
 
02:27:28.870 --> 02:27:28.880 align:start position:0%
Services that is funded by the the
 
02:27:32.750 --> 02:27:32.760 align:start position:0%
federal government and uh um like I said
 
02:27:35.870 --> 02:27:35.880 align:start position:0%
that's the same nationally every state
 
02:27:39.309 --> 02:27:39.319 align:start position:0%
every territory and many uh tribal
 
02:27:43.790 --> 02:27:43.800 align:start position:0%
agency tribes have 4D agencies uh and
 
02:27:45.670 --> 02:27:45.680 align:start position:0%
they all have to comply with the federal
 
02:27:49.590 --> 02:27:49.600 align:start position:0%
guidelines if this bill were to pass um
 
02:27:51.429 --> 02:27:51.439 align:start position:0%
I would be back or someone else would be
 
02:27:53.950 --> 02:27:53.960 align:start position:0%
back from Child Support next year
 
02:27:56.309 --> 02:27:56.319 align:start position:0%
requesting that this be changed so that
 
02:27:58.150 --> 02:27:58.160 align:start position:0%
we could be funded
 
02:28:01.070 --> 02:28:01.080 align:start position:0%
again follow up rosan
 
02:28:07.349 --> 02:28:07.359 align:start position:0%
Baran uh yes um so um uh there is a
 
02:28:09.710 --> 02:28:09.720 align:start position:0%
requirement every four years that the
 
02:28:12.990 --> 02:28:13.000 align:start position:0%
legislature review the child support
 
02:28:15.830 --> 02:28:15.840 align:start position:0%
guidelines um and make appropriate
 
02:28:18.389 --> 02:28:18.399 align:start position:0%
modifications and isn't that the purpose
 
02:28:22.590 --> 02:28:22.600 align:start position:0%
of what we had is HB
 
02:28:25.110 --> 02:28:25.120 align:start position:0%
362 which is now
 
02:28:29.269 --> 02:28:29.279 align:start position:0%
in um interim study so isn't that a
 
02:28:31.510 --> 02:28:31.520 align:start position:0%
place that we can address some of these
 
02:28:34.630 --> 02:28:34.640 align:start position:0%
issues particularly those related to
 
02:28:34.640 --> 02:28:35.950 align:start position:0%
issues particularly those related to
disabled

02:28:35.950 --> 02:28:35.960 align:start position:0%
disabled
 
02:28:39.469 --> 02:28:39.479 align:start position:0%
veterans absolutely that is the idea for
 
02:28:42.670 --> 02:28:42.680 align:start position:0%
the periodic review uh every four years
 
02:28:46.070 --> 02:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
there is to be a uh review of the child
 
02:28:49.750 --> 02:28:49.760 align:start position:0%
support guidelines issues such as this
 
02:28:52.510 --> 02:28:52.520 align:start position:0%
and the issue that keeps coming up uh
 
02:28:55.389 --> 02:28:55.399 align:start position:0%
throughout this discussion of shared
 
02:28:57.910 --> 02:28:57.920 align:start position:0%
parenting and how to provide for it
 
02:28:58.950 --> 02:28:58.960 align:start position:0%
within the
 
02:29:01.910 --> 02:29:01.920 align:start position:0%
guidelines uh that's all part of the
 
02:29:05.469 --> 02:29:05.479 align:start position:0%
guidelines review and the subsequent uh
 
02:29:07.590 --> 02:29:07.600 align:start position:0%
recommendations and and legislative
 
02:29:10.110 --> 02:29:10.120 align:start position:0%
action that really is we believe the
 
02:29:15.269 --> 02:29:15.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:21.269 --> 02:29:21.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:23.349 --> 02:29:23.359 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
02:29:26.309 --> 02:29:26.319 align:start position:0%
taking my question again sir so I need
 
02:29:29.750 --> 02:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
some help with some of these definitions
 
02:29:34.190 --> 02:29:34.200 align:start position:0%
what is the state plan and what is its
 
02:29:36.710 --> 02:29:36.720 align:start position:0%
origin thank you uh represent for the
 
02:29:39.230 --> 02:29:39.240 align:start position:0%
state plan is from the Social Security
 
02:29:41.190 --> 02:29:41.200 align:start position:0%
Act uh title
 
02:29:46.469 --> 02:29:46.479 align:start position:0%
4D uh it includes uh the re specific
 
02:29:49.150 --> 02:29:49.160 align:start position:0%
requirements that every state or
 
02:29:52.389 --> 02:29:52.399 align:start position:0%
territory or whatever entity has to uh
 
02:29:55.550 --> 02:29:55.560 align:start position:0%
put into place it's a set of laws uh
 
02:29:59.190 --> 02:29:59.200 align:start position:0%
concerning uh child support including
 
02:30:04.670 --> 02:30:04.680 align:start position:0%
the guidelines every uh every 4D agency
 
02:30:08.630 --> 02:30:08.640 align:start position:0%
and uh excuse me back up one more every
 
02:30:11.790 --> 02:30:11.800 align:start position:0%
state has to have in place uh the state
 
02:30:13.630 --> 02:30:13.640 align:start position:0%
plan for child support in order to
 
02:30:16.110 --> 02:30:16.120 align:start position:0%
receive 4D
 
02:30:21.190 --> 02:30:21.200 align:start position:0%
funding um so uh as a 4D agent
 
02:30:24.990 --> 02:30:25.000 align:start position:0%
uh as I was saying we get our a big
 
02:30:27.030 --> 02:30:27.040 align:start position:0%
amount of our funding through this
 
02:30:29.389 --> 02:30:29.399 align:start position:0%
Federal funding because the state is in
 
02:30:32.150 --> 02:30:32.160 align:start position:0%
compliance with uh the state plan for
 
02:30:35.830 --> 02:30:35.840 align:start position:0%
child support there's other uh state
 
02:30:38.710 --> 02:30:38.720 align:start position:0%
agencies that also have state plans that
 
02:30:41.590 --> 02:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
have uh Federal requirements this is
 
02:30:43.309 --> 02:30:43.319 align:start position:0%
really no different except that the
 
02:30:45.750 --> 02:30:45.760 align:start position:0%
funding level is significantly higher
 
02:30:48.910 --> 02:30:48.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:53.790 --> 02:30:53.800 align:start position:0%
ones follow up thank you Mr chairman so
 
02:30:56.269 --> 02:30:56.279 align:start position:0%
the origin of the plan that is specific
 
02:30:58.510 --> 02:30:58.520 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire is the federal
 
02:31:00.710 --> 02:31:00.720 align:start position:0%
government or is the state
 
02:31:03.750 --> 02:31:03.760 align:start position:0%
legislature uh the state plan itself is
 
02:31:05.710 --> 02:31:05.720 align:start position:0%
dictated by the Social Security Act
 
02:31:09.269 --> 02:31:09.279 align:start position:0%
federal law and uh through related
 
02:31:11.429 --> 02:31:11.439 align:start position:0%
regulations it is up to the state
 
02:31:15.550 --> 02:31:15.560 align:start position:0%
legislature then to uh to have laws on
 
02:31:18.870 --> 02:31:18.880 align:start position:0%
the books on a state level uh to comply
 
02:31:20.870 --> 02:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
with those Federal
 
02:31:23.910 --> 02:31:23.920 align:start position:0%
requirements um
 
02:31:27.389 --> 02:31:27.399 align:start position:0%
so uh that that's the relationship
 
02:31:28.389 --> 02:31:28.399 align:start position:0%
between the
 
02:31:31.830 --> 02:31:31.840 align:start position:0%
two representative horn followup uh last
 
02:31:33.389 --> 02:31:33.399 align:start position:0%
one Mr chairman I
 
02:31:33.399 --> 02:31:35.309 align:start position:0%
one Mr chairman I
promise

02:31:35.309 --> 02:31:35.319 align:start position:0%
promise
 
02:31:40.990 --> 02:31:41.000 align:start position:0%
so the FED gives us the skeleton under
 
02:31:43.710 --> 02:31:43.720 align:start position:0%
which we have to be compliant in order
 
02:31:46.030 --> 02:31:46.040 align:start position:0%
to receive federal funding putting meat
 
02:31:48.349 --> 02:31:48.359 align:start position:0%
and skin on that skeleton is the state's
 
02:31:51.070 --> 02:31:51.080 align:start position:0%
responsibility so then
 
02:31:52.309 --> 02:31:52.319 align:start position:0%
would that
 
02:31:57.269 --> 02:31:57.279 align:start position:0%
mean that sorry would that make this
 
02:32:00.950 --> 02:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
bill violate federal statute and which
 
02:32:02.590 --> 02:32:02.600 align:start position:0%
uh federal law and which federal law
 
02:32:04.110 --> 02:32:04.120 align:start position:0%
would they be violating if we adopted
 
02:32:06.070 --> 02:32:06.080 align:start position:0%
this bill well I've included the
 
02:32:08.309 --> 02:32:08.319 align:start position:0%
specific citation in my my written
 
02:32:11.389 --> 02:32:11.399 align:start position:0%
testimony but it has to do with the uh
 
02:32:14.070 --> 02:32:14.080 align:start position:0%
the Federal Regulations uh specific to
 
02:32:17.150 --> 02:32:17.160 align:start position:0%
child support guidelines which require
 
02:32:20.910 --> 02:32:20.920 align:start position:0%
that um all for forms of income be
 
02:32:23.670 --> 02:32:23.680 align:start position:0%
included in consideration under the
 
02:32:26.630 --> 02:32:26.640 align:start position:0%
guidelines and uh I if you I refer you
 
02:32:28.990 --> 02:32:29.000 align:start position:0%
to the brunstein case issued by the
 
02:32:31.830 --> 02:32:31.840 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court uh in February of this
 
02:32:34.309 --> 02:32:34.319 align:start position:0%
year where the Supreme Court looked at
 
02:32:37.190 --> 02:32:37.200 align:start position:0%
the child support guidelines and agreed
 
02:32:40.309 --> 02:32:40.319 align:start position:0%
that uh the inclusion of veterans
 
02:32:42.349 --> 02:32:42.359 align:start position:0%
disability benefits is consistent with
 
02:32:44.550 --> 02:32:44.560 align:start position:0%
those federal guidelines and uh I
 
02:32:47.349 --> 02:32:47.359 align:start position:0%
believe the the actual citation is
 
02:32:50.750 --> 02:32:50.760 align:start position:0%
45 uh CFR 3
 
02:32:50.760 --> 02:32:53.950 align:start position:0%
45 uh CFR 3
2.56

02:32:53.950 --> 02:32:53.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:56.510 --> 02:32:56.520 align:start position:0%
C1 but that that's included in my uh
 
02:32:56.520 --> 02:32:58.070 align:start position:0%
C1 but that that's included in my uh
written

02:32:58.070 --> 02:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
written
 
02:33:03.349 --> 02:33:03.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:08.269 --> 02:33:08.279 align:start position:0%
deimon thank you Mr chair um Mr Frasier
 
02:33:11.190 --> 02:33:11.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming today to testify
 
02:33:14.550 --> 02:33:14.560 align:start position:0%
but I I do have a question in so far as
 
02:33:16.389 --> 02:33:16.399 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court
 
02:33:19.190 --> 02:33:19.200 align:start position:0%
ruling Supreme Courts as every other
 
02:33:24.950 --> 02:33:24.960 align:start position:0%
court rule um with the fact that they
 
02:33:29.429 --> 02:33:29.439 align:start position:0%
interpret the law isn't that correct uh
 
02:33:33.750 --> 02:33:33.760 align:start position:0%
true and uh the Supreme Court of New
 
02:33:37.950 --> 02:33:37.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's the last word on on uh all
 
02:33:40.550 --> 02:33:40.560 align:start position:0%
form on all determinations of what the
 
02:33:43.230 --> 02:33:43.240 align:start position:0%
law is in New Hampshire uh except for
 
02:33:45.030 --> 02:33:45.040 align:start position:0%
constitutional issues that could be
 
02:33:48.389 --> 02:33:48.399 align:start position:0%
appealed to the Supreme Court thank
 
02:33:53.230 --> 02:33:53.240 align:start position:0%
followup thank you so isn't it true that
 
02:33:57.750 --> 02:33:57.760 align:start position:0%
um this same issue could be fought in a
 
02:34:03.070 --> 02:34:03.080 align:start position:0%
court of law and another judge May
 
02:34:08.750 --> 02:34:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:13.349 --> 02:34:13.359 align:start position:0%
man therefore throwing this ruling out
 
02:34:14.790 --> 02:34:14.800 align:start position:0%
isn't that
 
02:34:18.030 --> 02:34:18.040 align:start position:0%
correct uh this would require the New
 
02:34:21.070 --> 02:34:21.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court to overturn
 
02:34:23.710 --> 02:34:23.720 align:start position:0%
itself it would have to be right another
 
02:34:26.670 --> 02:34:26.680 align:start position:0%
case right that's possible
 
02:34:30.750 --> 02:34:30.760 align:start position:0%
sure so final followup Mr followup sure
 
02:34:35.870 --> 02:34:35.880 align:start position:0%
thank you so isn't it possible that if
 
02:34:42.469 --> 02:34:42.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:44.950 --> 02:34:44.960 align:start position:0%
legislation that the New Hampshire
 
02:34:49.990 --> 02:34:50.000 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court can in fact uphold this
 
02:34:54.190 --> 02:34:54.200 align:start position:0%
legislation due to its interpretation of
 
02:34:57.070 --> 02:34:57.080 align:start position:0%
both federal and state
 
02:35:00.030 --> 02:35:00.040 align:start position:0%
law okay uh thank you for the question
 
02:35:04.349 --> 02:35:04.359 align:start position:0%
representative Simone and uh I don't
 
02:35:07.190 --> 02:35:07.200 align:start position:0%
think that there this if this law were
 
02:35:11.750 --> 02:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
passed it wouldn't be in violation of
 
02:35:15.230 --> 02:35:15.240 align:start position:0%
any state law what it would do is simply
 
02:35:17.630 --> 02:35:17.640 align:start position:0%
put the state out of
 
02:35:20.630 --> 02:35:20.640 align:start position:0%
compliance with the Federal regulations
 
02:35:23.910 --> 02:35:23.920 align:start position:0%
concerning child support guidelines that
 
02:35:26.590 --> 02:35:26.600 align:start position:0%
has implications for funding and as I
 
02:35:28.790 --> 02:35:28.800 align:start position:0%
was saying here in my testimony the real
 
02:35:32.030 --> 02:35:32.040 align:start position:0%
implication is that uh this could
 
02:35:35.309 --> 02:35:35.319 align:start position:0%
potentially lessen the amount of support
 
02:35:38.230 --> 02:35:38.240 align:start position:0%
for children children of disabled
 
02:35:41.309 --> 02:35:41.319 align:start position:0%
veterans significantly and effectively
 
02:35:45.110 --> 02:35:45.120 align:start position:0%
impoverish them and require more Public
 
02:35:48.269 --> 02:35:48.279 align:start position:0%
Assistance uh that's the real effect
 
02:35:54.030 --> 02:35:54.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:56.429 --> 02:35:56.439 align:start position:0%
final okay you have to unmute yourself
 
02:36:02.790 --> 02:36:02.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:06.030 --> 02:36:06.040 align:start position:0%
deimon Christina can we unmute there we
 
02:36:09.990 --> 02:36:10.000 align:start position:0%
go okay so if I may make one final
 
02:36:12.710 --> 02:36:12.720 align:start position:0%
comment um in conjunction with uh
 
02:36:14.710 --> 02:36:14.720 align:start position:0%
representative Baran statement
 
02:36:17.830 --> 02:36:17.840 align:start position:0%
concerning House Bill
 
02:36:24.309 --> 02:36:24.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:27.990 --> 02:36:28.000 align:start position:0%
362 and Encompass some of what is going
 
02:36:30.710 --> 02:36:30.720 align:start position:0%
on in this bill as well it's not going
 
02:36:34.670 --> 02:36:34.680 align:start position:0%
to impoverish um children and it it's
 
02:36:37.790 --> 02:36:37.800 align:start position:0%
only going to enhance the uh child
 
02:36:40.990 --> 02:36:41.000 align:start position:0%
support uh guidelines and and and that's
 
02:36:44.870 --> 02:36:44.880 align:start position:0%

some difficult decisions to be made I'm
 
02:38:16.670 --> 02:38:16.680 align:start position:0%
100% disabled veteran I'm not affected
 
02:38:19.230 --> 02:38:19.240 align:start position:0%
in the same way the other veterans are
 
02:38:21.550 --> 02:38:21.560 align:start position:0%
uh but I have been a veterans advocate
 
02:38:23.710 --> 02:38:23.720 align:start position:0%
for the last 31 months since my
 
02:38:25.990 --> 02:38:26.000 align:start position:0%
retirement from the US military I've
 
02:38:29.349 --> 02:38:29.359 align:start position:0%
done this uh I'm a national Advocate a
 
02:38:32.230 --> 02:38:32.240 align:start position:0%
state Advocate uh
 
02:38:34.870 --> 02:38:34.880 align:start position:0%
and uh our veterans are in a very
 
02:38:36.830 --> 02:38:36.840 align:start position:0%
serious situation here as you as you
 
02:38:39.469 --> 02:38:39.479 align:start position:0%
have heard and the testimony about
 
02:38:41.670 --> 02:38:41.680 align:start position:0%
putting Children at Risk is also
 
02:38:44.870 --> 02:38:44.880 align:start position:0%
concerning but I have talked to Veterans

under bridges I've talked to them uh in
 
02:38:50.510 --> 02:38:50.520 align:start position:0%
homeless areas across this state and I
 
02:38:56.630 --> 02:38:56.640 align:start position:0%
am uh very very concerned that their um
 
02:39:01.790 --> 02:39:01.800 align:start position:0%
disability pay would be uh considered uh
 
02:39:05.630 --> 02:39:05.640 align:start position:0%
as um you know in in the process uh and
 
02:39:08.750 --> 02:39:08.760 align:start position:0%
and I think that this is a a a bill that
 
02:39:12.110 --> 02:39:12.120 align:start position:0%
must be passed it must be considered uh
 
02:39:16.030 --> 02:39:16.040 align:start position:0%
and I am an advocate for it uh and I am
 
02:39:18.990 --> 02:39:19.000 align:start position:0%
speaking to you as a veterans Advocate
 
02:39:22.550 --> 02:39:22.560 align:start position:0%

02:39:53.550 --> 02:39:53.560 align:start position:0%
across the country in terms of this
 
02:39:56.950 --> 02:39:56.960 align:start position:0%
situation arising within different
 
02:40:01.309 --> 02:40:01.319 align:start position:0%
states uh it is my uh understanding that
 
02:40:04.349 --> 02:40:04.359 align:start position:0%
uh this situation uh is experienced by
 
02:40:06.950 --> 02:40:06.960 align:start position:0%
veterans across the country uh I
 
02:40:10.910 --> 02:40:10.920 align:start position:0%
wouldn't call it an uh an outlier
 
02:40:13.030 --> 02:40:13.040 align:start position:0%
perhaps but I believe that there are
 
02:40:15.349 --> 02:40:15.359 align:start position:0%
some things at the federal level that
 
02:40:18.389 --> 02:40:18.399 align:start position:0%
must be changed uh in order for the
 
02:40:20.950 --> 02:40:20.960 align:start position:0%
states to be able to do these things uh
 
02:40:22.710 --> 02:40:22.720 align:start position:0%
much more practically and take care of
 
02:40:26.950 --> 02:40:26.960 align:start position:0%
children and their veterans um but uh so
 
02:40:30.830 --> 02:40:30.840 align:start position:0%
you will see this in other states yes
 
02:40:34.070 --> 02:40:34.080 align:start position:0%
sir follow up M representative Carson so
 
02:40:35.630 --> 02:40:35.640 align:start position:0%
quickly do you have any advice about how
 
02:40:38.150 --> 02:40:38.160 align:start position:0%
to do that from our point of view how
 
02:40:39.150 --> 02:40:39.160 align:start position:0%
can we
 
02:40:42.070 --> 02:40:42.080 align:start position:0%
help well I think you know like I have
 
02:40:44.750 --> 02:40:44.760 align:start position:0%
done uh contacting our Congressional
 
02:40:49.110 --> 02:40:49.120 align:start position:0%
leadership in Washington DC um of course
 
02:40:52.190 --> 02:40:52.200 align:start position:0%
that hasn't been very effective for me
 
02:40:54.870 --> 02:40:54.880 align:start position:0%
uh and I'm I am pursuing another course
 
02:40:58.070 --> 02:40:58.080 align:start position:0%
of action to uh to have an effect on
 
02:41:02.349 --> 02:41:02.359 align:start position:0%
that as you're probably all aware but um
 
02:41:06.110 --> 02:41:06.120 align:start position:0%
uh really advocating to them uh I've
 
02:41:07.830 --> 02:41:07.840 align:start position:0%
written to other veterans I've written
 
02:41:10.910 --> 02:41:10.920 align:start position:0%
to the uh uh Veteran Affairs and I've
 
02:41:14.670 --> 02:41:14.680 align:start position:0%
called the white house uh as well uh and
 
02:41:17.510 --> 02:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
and uh you know discuss this with the
 
02:41:20.070 --> 02:41:20.080 align:start position:0%
white house as well uh to try and get
 
02:41:23.269 --> 02:41:23.279 align:start position:0%
these you know the the federal I don't
 
02:41:25.750 --> 02:41:25.760 align:start position:0%
call them loopholes but gaps president's
 
02:41:28.070 --> 02:41:28.080 align:start position:0%
doing excellent to support our veterans
 
02:41:30.670 --> 02:41:30.680 align:start position:0%
but it falls inside a bureaucracy that
 
02:41:33.150 --> 02:41:33.160 align:start position:0%
has all these loopholes and gaps and
 
02:41:34.550 --> 02:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
things that they hadn't considered or
 
02:41:36.750 --> 02:41:36.760 align:start position:0%
things they didn't change uh and so we
 
02:41:38.830 --> 02:41:38.840 align:start position:0%
find ourselves in that problem so
 
02:41:41.469 --> 02:41:41.479 align:start position:0%
appealing to our federal Representatives
 
02:41:44.230 --> 02:41:44.240 align:start position:0%
is how I'm trying to do it now thank you
 
02:41:48.510 --> 02:41:48.520 align:start position:0%
very much you're welcome uh so seeing no
 
02:41:51.510 --> 02:41:51.520 align:start position:0%

here but it doesn't look like she's here
 
02:42:15.070 --> 02:42:15.080 align:start position:0%

02:42:47.190 --> 02:42:47.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:49.710 --> 02:42:49.720 align:start position:0%
30311 case closure for
 
02:42:53.429 --> 02:42:53.439 align:start position:0%
um criteria the title 4D agency can
 
02:42:54.670 --> 02:42:54.680 align:start position:0%
close a
 
02:42:58.190 --> 02:42:58.200 align:start position:0%
case um when it has a medically verified
 
02:42:59.630 --> 02:42:59.640 align:start position:0%
total impermanent
 
02:43:02.230 --> 02:43:02.240 align:start position:0%
disability and the the state determines
 
02:43:04.030 --> 02:43:04.040 align:start position:0%
that the non-custodial parent is no
 
02:43:06.950 --> 02:43:06.960 align:start position:0%
income or assets available that can be
 
02:43:10.110 --> 02:43:10.120 align:start position:0%
levied or attached for support it also
 
02:43:12.429 --> 02:43:12.439 align:start position:0%
says further that non-o parent sole
 
02:43:15.830 --> 02:43:15.840 align:start position:0%
income when proven to be SSI or SSDI
 
02:43:18.269 --> 02:43:18.279 align:start position:0%
won't be attached and the case will be a
 
02:43:20.950 --> 02:43:20.960 align:start position:0%
clo a Clos so I'm just
 
02:43:23.630 --> 02:43:23.640 align:start position:0%
curious why he didn't mention that in
 
02:43:23.640 --> 02:43:25.230 align:start position:0%
curious why he didn't mention that in
his

02:43:25.230 --> 02:43:25.240 align:start position:0%
his
 
02:43:31.790 --> 02:43:31.800 align:start position:0%

02:44:13.790 --> 02:44:13.800 align:start position:0%
lastly excuse me I'm sorry I'm jumping
 
02:44:18.349 --> 02:44:18.359 align:start position:0%
around um they amended last year 11 USC
 
02:44:18.359 --> 02:44:19.830 align:start position:0%
around um they amended last year 11 USC
101

02:44:19.830 --> 02:44:19.840 align:start position:0%
101
 
02:44:23.550 --> 02:44:23.560 align:start position:0%
10 a and they changed paragraph sub
 
02:44:23.560 --> 02:44:25.190 align:start position:0%
10 a and they changed paragraph sub
paragraph

02:44:25.190 --> 02:44:25.200 align:start position:0%
paragraph
 
02:44:28.950 --> 02:44:28.960 align:start position:0%
b um to reflect
 
02:44:32.389 --> 02:44:32.399 align:start position:0%
that except any retired pay excluded
 
02:44:34.830 --> 02:44:34.840 align:start position:0%
under the subclause shall include
 
02:44:38.030 --> 02:44:38.040 align:start position:0%
retired pay under shall include retired
 
02:44:40.550 --> 02:44:40.560 align:start position:0%
pay under chapter 61 or title 10 only to
 
02:44:43.550 --> 02:44:43.560 align:start position:0%
the extent that such retired pay exceeds
 
02:44:45.150 --> 02:44:45.160 align:start position:0%
the amount of retired pay to which the
 
02:44:49.030 --> 02:44:49.040 align:start position:0%
debtor would otherwise be entitled if
 
02:44:52.190 --> 02:44:52.200 align:start position:0%
retired under any provision of title 10
 
02:44:53.670 --> 02:44:53.680 align:start position:0%
other than chapter
 
02:44:56.670 --> 02:44:56.680 align:start position:0%
61 not all military retirement is the
 
02:45:00.510 --> 02:45:00.520 align:start position:0%
same and HSS is trying to
 
02:45:03.230 --> 02:45:03.240 align:start position:0%
to kind of convince you of that fact
 
02:45:06.030 --> 02:45:06.040 align:start position:0%
that that the retirement is all the same
 
02:45:09.910 --> 02:45:09.920 align:start position:0%
not every veteran serves 20 years and so
 
02:45:12.190 --> 02:45:12.200 align:start position:0%
medical retirements that's where that
 
02:45:13.830 --> 02:45:13.840 align:start position:0%
protection is for that's why the
 
02:45:16.389 --> 02:45:16.399 align:start position:0%
apportionment should be done so that the
 
02:45:19.150 --> 02:45:19.160 align:start position:0%
secretary can determine whether or not
 
02:45:21.150 --> 02:45:21.160 align:start position:0%
the veteran served 20 years and is
 
02:45:25.990 --> 02:45:26.000 align:start position:0%
waving a portion of his earned income
 
02:45:29.590 --> 02:45:29.600 align:start position:0%
retirement or if he is a disabled
 
02:45:32.910 --> 02:45:32.920 align:start position:0%
veteran who is unable to provide income
 
02:45:34.710 --> 02:45:34.720 align:start position:0%
for his
 
02:45:38.230 --> 02:45:38.240 align:start position:0%
dependent when that's the case they're
 
02:45:40.990 --> 02:45:41.000 align:start position:0%
entitled to Social Security disability
 
02:45:44.349 --> 02:45:44.359 align:start position:0%
insurance at which point Social Security
 
02:45:47.389 --> 02:45:47.399 align:start position:0%
provides 55 to
 
02:45:49.469 --> 02:45:49.479 align:start position:0%
56% of
 
02:45:52.429 --> 02:45:52.439 align:start position:0%
the awarded Social Security
 
02:45:56.389 --> 02:45:56.399 align:start position:0%
Insurance via a schematic trust directly
 
02:45:59.429 --> 02:45:59.439 align:start position:0%
to the dependants so the dependants are
 
02:46:01.950 --> 02:46:01.960 align:start position:0%
receiving 55% of
 
02:46:06.950 --> 02:46:06.960 align:start position:0%
that money directly paid to them through
 
02:46:06.960 --> 02:46:08.269 align:start position:0%
that money directly paid to them through
Social

02:46:08.269 --> 02:46:08.279 align:start position:0%
Social
 
02:46:10.830 --> 02:46:10.840 align:start position:0%
Security because they're indent and
 
02:46:13.990 --> 02:46:14.000 align:start position:0%
unable to provide for their family
 
02:46:16.070 --> 02:46:16.080 align:start position:0%

02:47:50.750 --> 02:47:50.760 align:start position:0%
um we did have someone who did register
 
02:47:54.830 --> 02:47:54.840 align:start position:0%
um while we were speaking um again yeah
 
02:47:57.030 --> 02:47:57.040 align:start position:0%
I know but I thought I thought that see
 
02:47:58.790 --> 02:47:58.800 align:start position:0%
I knew that this was I knew this was
 
02:48:00.469 --> 02:48:00.479 align:start position:0%
going to happen that people are going to
 
02:48:03.030 --> 02:48:03.040 align:start position:0%
register while we're sitting here in a
 
02:48:06.190 --> 02:48:06.200 align:start position:0%
three-hour public hearing and and so now
 
02:48:08.190 --> 02:48:08.200 align:start position:0%
we have no idea how much longer this is
 
02:48:10.429 --> 02:48:10.439 align:start position:0%
going to go on and I think it's I think
 
02:48:13.429 --> 02:48:13.439 align:start position:0%
if anything you need to at least recess
 
02:48:15.309 --> 02:48:15.319 align:start position:0%
this hearing we can come back to it but
 
02:48:17.950 --> 02:48:17.960 align:start position:0%
you have to get to SP 295 which you
 
02:48:19.230 --> 02:48:19.240 align:start position:0%
scheduled for
 
02:48:21.670 --> 02:48:21.680 align:start position:0%
o' because now we're making all those
 
02:48:25.590 --> 02:48:25.600 align:start position:0%
people sit and wait and and can't I I
 
02:48:27.469 --> 02:48:27.479 align:start position:0%
understand that historically in a house
 
02:48:29.910 --> 02:48:29.920 align:start position:0%
that has what happened plenty of times I
 
02:48:31.790 --> 02:48:31.800 align:start position:0%
had a scheduled meeting at 10: and
 
02:48:33.710 --> 02:48:33.720 align:start position:0%
waited till two o'clock in the afternoon
 
02:48:36.710 --> 02:48:36.720 align:start position:0%
to introduce a bill I I get that I I
 
02:48:39.070 --> 02:48:39.080 align:start position:0%
don't like that that happens but that
 
02:48:41.230 --> 02:48:41.240 align:start position:0%
that's out of my control so we have one
 
02:48:43.309 --> 02:48:43.319 align:start position:0%
more that there's there's other people
 
02:48:44.870 --> 02:48:44.880 align:start position:0%
with their hands up but they've already
 
02:48:46.670 --> 02:48:46.680 align:start position:0%
testified I'm not going to have them
 
02:48:49.710 --> 02:48:49.720 align:start position:0%
testify again uh so we have one more and
 
02:48:52.309 --> 02:48:52.319 align:start position:0%
then we could close this hearing uh and
 
02:48:54.830 --> 02:48:54.840 align:start position:0%
that is I believe is that Robert Thomas
 
02:48:58.110 --> 02:48:58.120 align:start position:0%
uh yes it is okay uh Mr
 
02:49:02.030 --> 02:49:02.040 align:start position:0%
Thomas yes can you hear me I can yes can
 
02:49:03.670 --> 02:49:03.680 align:start position:0%

and sincerely and understanding Mr
 
02:49:51.910 --> 02:49:51.920 align:start position:0%
Fraser takes a take on what the state
 
02:49:53.990 --> 02:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
allows to rip us off somewhere people
 
02:49:56.030 --> 02:49:56.040 align:start position:0%
have forgot that federal funds everybody
 
02:49:57.910 --> 02:49:57.920 align:start position:0%
sitting on this panel pay their taxes
 
02:50:00.630 --> 02:50:00.640 align:start position:0%
and you paid for Tanis you paid for me
 
02:50:02.469 --> 02:50:02.479 align:start position:0%
to be free today and I'm talking about
 
02:50:05.750 --> 02:50:05.760 align:start position:0%
from expense of losing family friends at
 
02:50:08.469 --> 02:50:08.479 align:start position:0%
War coming back home and as my brother
 
02:50:11.229 --> 02:50:11.239 align:start position:0%
bushot stated this is the worst battle
 
02:50:13.750 --> 02:50:13.760 align:start position:0%
I've had to get home 22 years later I
 
02:50:16.710 --> 02:50:16.720 align:start position:0%
went back to VA at 2015 and have only
 
02:50:18.670 --> 02:50:18.680 align:start position:0%
been receiving benefits after my
 
02:50:20.590 --> 02:50:20.600 align:start position:0%
children are grown my fight has been
 
02:50:22.349 --> 02:50:22.359 align:start position:0%
with aers through the child support
 
02:50:25.630 --> 02:50:25.640 align:start position:0%
systems the court system does not care
 
02:50:28.229 --> 02:50:28.239 align:start position:0%
to hear what Veterans of sin it is
 
02:50:31.429 --> 02:50:31.439 align:start position:0%
absurd I am a Paul that the people I
 
02:50:33.349 --> 02:50:33.359 align:start position:0%
went to die and fight for look at me
 
02:50:35.630 --> 02:50:35.640 align:start position:0%
like I'm nobody when I've been a soldier
 
02:50:38.750 --> 02:50:38.760 align:start position:0%
in the Army I fought for you I fought
 
02:50:40.910 --> 02:50:40.920 align:start position:0%
for my free Liberties yours in this
 
02:50:42.750 --> 02:50:42.760 align:start position:0%
world for as we speak today and how we
 
02:50:45.150 --> 02:50:45.160 align:start position:0%
stand and seek to call ourselves
 
02:50:48.630 --> 02:50:48.640 align:start position:0%
American iord any child not being able
 
02:50:50.349 --> 02:50:50.359 align:start position:0%
honor to have food on the table clothing
 
02:50:52.349 --> 02:50:52.359 align:start position:0%
on their back Etc but we don't know the
 
02:50:54.070 --> 02:50:54.080 align:start position:0%
intricacies or the personal algy will
 
02:50:55.150 --> 02:50:55.160 align:start position:0%
happen in these families when they
 
02:50:57.469 --> 02:50:57.479 align:start position:0%
divorce I've gone through divorce I'm
 
02:51:00.150 --> 02:51:00.160 align:start position:0%
remarried today but with that
 
02:51:04.229 --> 02:51:04.239 align:start position:0%
said title 38 clears all that Mr Frasier
 
02:51:05.510 --> 02:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
wants to allude to the fact that the
 
02:51:07.030 --> 02:51:07.040 align:start position:0%
state federal government does not care
 
02:51:09.030 --> 02:51:09.040 align:start position:0%
about children does not care about the
 
02:51:10.229 --> 02:51:10.239 align:start position:0%
the parent when it comes to child
 
02:51:12.389 --> 02:51:12.399 align:start position:0%
support the law is written very simply
 
02:51:14.469 --> 02:51:14.479 align:start position:0%
is to recoup the funding of the federal
 
02:51:16.429 --> 02:51:16.439 align:start position:0%
expenditures through tanip that they
 
02:51:19.030 --> 02:51:19.040 align:start position:0%
have put out there that's what title for
 
02:51:20.990 --> 02:51:21.000 align:start position:0%
DS4 it's not even a real court but what
 
02:51:22.670 --> 02:51:22.680 align:start position:0%
they do is allude to the fact they pat
 
02:51:24.630 --> 02:51:24.640 align:start position:0%
their pockets there's a kitty called
 
02:51:26.790 --> 02:51:26.800 align:start position:0%
dispersement that the so-called judg is
 
02:51:28.590 --> 02:51:28.600 align:start position:0%
getting paid from the hearing officer
 
02:51:30.190 --> 02:51:30.200 align:start position:0%
gets paid from nobody wants to talk
 
02:51:32.429 --> 02:51:32.439 align:start position:0%
about that story Mr Fraser want to make
 
02:51:34.150 --> 02:51:34.160 align:start position:0%
it seem like they're doing us to some
 
02:51:36.110 --> 02:51:36.120 align:start position:0%
type of favor but the federal government
 
02:51:38.830 --> 02:51:38.840 align:start position:0%
has already been very clear Congress May
 
02:51:41.990 --> 02:51:42.000 align:start position:0%
15 2017 this is you I'm app Paul people
 
02:51:43.790 --> 02:51:43.800 align:start position:0%
don't are not aware of this if you guys
 
02:51:46.750 --> 02:51:46.760 align:start position:0%
will look it up May 15 how versus how
 
02:51:49.110 --> 02:51:49.120 align:start position:0%
killed the Rose versus Rose that these
 
02:51:50.990 --> 02:51:51.000 align:start position:0%
courts Local District have been using
 
02:51:52.830 --> 02:51:52.840 align:start position:0%
against veterans when we go before them
 
02:51:55.710 --> 02:51:55.720 align:start position:0%
to throw us offic say no we can use
 
02:51:57.590 --> 02:51:57.600 align:start position:0%
these monies no you can't use this money
 
02:52:00.630 --> 02:52:00.640 align:start position:0%
it says very clearly before after
 
02:52:02.630 --> 02:52:02.640 align:start position:0%
payments due to become due under the law
 
02:52:04.110 --> 02:52:04.120 align:start position:0%
administered by the secretary shall not
 
02:52:05.550 --> 02:52:05.560 align:start position:0%
be assigned will accept extent
 
02:52:07.630 --> 02:52:07.640 align:start position:0%
specifically authorized by law and such
 
02:52:09.670 --> 02:52:09.680 align:start position:0%
payments made to or on account of a
 
02:52:11.110 --> 02:52:11.120 align:start position:0%
beneficiary shall be exempt from
 
02:52:13.269 --> 02:52:13.279 align:start position:0%
taxation shall be exempt from claim of
 
02:52:14.950 --> 02:52:14.960 align:start position:0%
creditors and shall be liable to
 
02:52:17.110 --> 02:52:17.120 align:start position:0%
attachment Levy seizure or any other
 
02:52:20.190 --> 02:52:20.200 align:start position:0%
legal or equitable process whatsoever
 
02:52:21.910 --> 02:52:21.920 align:start position:0%
either before or after receip of
 
02:52:24.670 --> 02:52:24.680 align:start position:0%
beneficiary that's PL in day all we need
 
02:52:26.910 --> 02:52:26.920 align:start position:0%
to do at your level is Implement what
 
02:52:28.790 --> 02:52:28.800 align:start position:0%
has already been written most recently
 
02:52:31.910 --> 02:52:31.920 align:start position:0%
May 15 2017 the Supreme Court affirmed
 
02:52:34.590 --> 02:52:34.600 align:start position:0%
all veteran benefits have been protected
 
02:52:38.550 --> 02:52:38.560 align:start position:0%
by 38 USC 5301 devastating the indirect
 
02:52:41.429 --> 02:52:41.439 align:start position:0%
challenges under property States cannot
 
02:52:43.269 --> 02:52:43.279 align:start position:0%
courts cannot vest that which under
 
02:52:44.830 --> 02:52:44.840 align:start position:0%
Government Federal Law they lack the
 
02:52:46.710 --> 02:52:46.720 align:start position:0%
authority to give that clears up Mr
 
02:52:49.269 --> 02:52:49.279 align:start position:0%
Fraser's story about his benefit that
 
02:52:51.269 --> 02:52:51.279 align:start position:0%
comes back from the federal funding how
 
02:52:54.150 --> 02:52:54.160 align:start position:0%
their Patty Pockets using our money mind
 
02:52:56.469 --> 02:52:56.479 align:start position:0%
you your money cuz you pay me you pay
 
02:52:58.429 --> 02:52:58.439 align:start position:0%
every veteran who receives this benefit
 
02:53:00.469 --> 02:53:00.479 align:start position:0%
so what you would like to think is this
 
02:53:03.030 --> 02:53:03.040 align:start position:0%
so the government take taxpayers dollars
 
02:53:04.910 --> 02:53:04.920 align:start position:0%
pay a disabled veteran such as myself
 
02:53:06.790 --> 02:53:06.800 align:start position:0%
and turn around and take the money to
 
02:53:09.309 --> 02:53:09.319 align:start position:0%
give someone an award for child support
 
02:53:11.269 --> 02:53:11.279 align:start position:0%
that's counterproductive and it also
 
02:53:13.630 --> 02:53:13.640 align:start position:0%
will leave me homeless or commit suicide
 
02:53:15.190 --> 02:53:15.200 align:start position:0%
you can Google all you got your phones
 
02:53:16.950 --> 02:53:16.960 align:start position:0%
present I like you to Google how many
 
02:53:18.950 --> 02:53:18.960 align:start position:0%
veterans are killing themselves
 
02:53:21.750 --> 02:53:21.760 align:start position:0%
daily that went through my War era and
 
02:53:23.710 --> 02:53:23.720 align:start position:0%
maybe because of Reason such as this I
 
02:53:26.269 --> 02:53:26.279 align:start position:0%
contemplated suicide several points to
 
02:53:28.830 --> 02:53:28.840 align:start position:0%
this process tired of fighting I've been
 
02:53:31.910 --> 02:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
in that War I made it back home safe 22
 
02:53:33.630 --> 02:53:33.640 align:start position:0%
years later my government now says Mr
 
02:53:35.429 --> 02:53:35.439 align:start position:0%
Thomas we're going to help take care of
 
02:53:37.870 --> 02:53:37.880 align:start position:0%
you and then I have to fight again out
 
02:53:40.830 --> 02:53:40.840 align:start position:0%
of a 70% award by the federal government
 
02:53:42.830 --> 02:53:42.840 align:start position:0%
the courts was asking for
 
02:53:46.150 --> 02:53:46.160 align:start position:0%
$571 for one child when all my other
 
02:53:49.030 --> 02:53:49.040 align:start position:0%
children was grown out of $1,400 a month
 
02:53:50.670 --> 02:53:50.680 align:start position:0%
please tell me could anyone in this
 
02:53:54.229 --> 02:53:54.239 align:start position:0%
panel live offer the $800 indifference
 
02:53:57.110 --> 02:53:57.120 align:start position:0%
if I had to pay the $571 and that money
 
02:53:59.750 --> 02:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
was exempt has been exempt it's been
 
02:54:01.030 --> 02:54:01.040 align:start position:0%
clear there should not even be a
 
02:54:02.910 --> 02:54:02.920 align:start position:0%
discussion at legislative body in your
 
02:54:04.910 --> 02:54:04.920 align:start position:0%
state discussing what this is what we
 
02:54:06.710 --> 02:54:06.720 align:start position:0%
need to do is simply implement the rules
 
02:54:11.190 --> 02:54:11.200 align:start position:0%
that's already there 38 USC 5301 38 USC
 
02:54:14.110 --> 02:54:14.120 align:start position:0%
5307 which is a pment which equates to
 
02:54:16.389 --> 02:54:16.399 align:start position:0%
garnishment okay because in theory what
 
02:54:18.030 --> 02:54:18.040 align:start position:0%
you would be simply saying it's okay to
 
02:54:19.309 --> 02:54:19.319 align:start position:0%
take the federal government that is
 
02:54:20.990 --> 02:54:21.000 align:start position:0%
being given to me to take care of me
 
02:54:22.790 --> 02:54:22.800 align:start position:0%
because I can't take care of myself
 
02:54:25.150 --> 02:54:25.160 align:start position:0%
that's absurd totally absurd and the
 
02:54:26.590 --> 02:54:26.600 align:start position:0%
think that American soldiers this what
 
02:54:28.590 --> 02:54:28.600 align:start position:0%
we went to fight for come back home and
 
02:54:31.630 --> 02:54:31.640 align:start position:0%
have to fight again it's appalling it is
 
02:54:34.269 --> 02:54:34.279 align:start position:0%
it's AET nine and soldiers are killing
 
02:54:35.870 --> 02:54:35.880 align:start position:0%
themselves probably due to this cause
 
02:54:37.190 --> 02:54:37.200 align:start position:0%
I'm talking to my friends and my
 
02:54:39.429 --> 02:54:39.439 align:start position:0%
brothers every day online throughout
 
02:54:41.269 --> 02:54:41.279 align:start position:0%
this country this is not just a problem
 
02:54:43.030 --> 02:54:43.040 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire it's a problem
 
02:54:45.349 --> 02:54:45.359 align:start position:0%
throughout the country the thing that
 
02:54:47.910 --> 02:54:47.920 align:start position:0%
gets me is the child support department
 
02:54:50.269 --> 02:54:50.279 align:start position:0%
of revenue here St by the state
 
02:54:51.550 --> 02:54:51.560 align:start position:0%
understand this federal government
 
02:54:53.670 --> 02:54:53.680 align:start position:0%
program through Social Security okay
 
02:54:55.910 --> 02:54:55.920 align:start position:0%
allocated funds every year being matched
 
02:54:57.349 --> 02:54:57.359 align:start position:0%
by what the veterans money that been
 
02:55:00.070 --> 02:55:00.080 align:start position:0%
given us by taxpayers that's a ripoff
 
02:55:01.990 --> 02:55:02.000 align:start position:0%
somebody is doing an injustice much less
 
02:55:03.950 --> 02:55:03.960 align:start position:0%
with the taxpayer dollar but they also
 
02:55:05.670 --> 02:55:05.680 align:start position:0%
turn around they taking it back and
 
02:55:07.429 --> 02:55:07.439 align:start position:0%
patting their own Pockets because if
 
02:55:09.070 --> 02:55:09.080 align:start position:0%
through dispersement that so-called
 
02:55:10.429 --> 02:55:10.439 align:start position:0%
judge that's sitting there that's a fake
 
02:55:11.550 --> 02:55:11.560 align:start position:0%
judge not a
 
02:55:14.110 --> 02:55:14.120 align:start position:0%
title Thomas Mr Thomas you're getting
 
02:55:16.429 --> 02:55:16.439 align:start position:0%
you're getting a little off course Mr
 
02:55:19.269 --> 02:55:19.279 align:start position:0%
Thomas we're we're here on uh House Bill
 
02:55:22.229 --> 02:55:22.239 align:start position:0%
1716 you're getting a little off course
 
02:55:25.030 --> 02:55:25.040 align:start position:0%
now I'm apologize I'm emotional but no
 
02:55:27.910 --> 02:55:27.920 align:start position:0%
need to apologize just here's a cut
 
02:55:30.349 --> 02:55:30.359 align:start position:0%
through title 38 already secures the
 
02:55:33.469 --> 02:55:33.479 align:start position:0%
veterans benefit very good okay Congress
 
02:55:36.870 --> 02:55:36.880 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court ruling May 15 2017 already
 
02:55:38.790 --> 02:55:38.800 align:start position:0%
took the powers from these courts to do
 
02:55:40.469 --> 02:55:40.479 align:start position:0%
what they're doing to Veterans the
 
02:55:42.870 --> 02:55:42.880 align:start position:0%
proper protocol when it comes with
 
02:55:44.229 --> 02:55:44.239 align:start position:0%
there's a guideline very simply says
 
02:55:46.110 --> 02:55:46.120 align:start position:0%
when a a veteran comes before the court
 
02:55:47.590 --> 02:55:47.600 align:start position:0%
there's four simple little rules you
 
02:55:50.389 --> 02:55:50.399 align:start position:0%
first you you you decide is the VOR my
 
02:55:52.990 --> 02:55:53.000 align:start position:0%
DD214 proves that does I receive any
 
02:55:54.710 --> 02:55:54.720 align:start position:0%
benefit from the uh government there's
 
02:55:56.950 --> 02:55:56.960 align:start position:0%
my award letter and then it also tells
 
02:55:59.229 --> 02:55:59.239 align:start position:0%
you the portion that there's that waret
 
02:56:01.070 --> 02:56:01.080 align:start position:0%
that goes off the table can't be used
 
02:56:03.229 --> 02:56:03.239 align:start position:0%
for numeration of income Mr Frasier
 
02:56:04.830 --> 02:56:04.840 align:start position:0%
would like to allude to that in the
 
02:56:07.150 --> 02:56:07.160 align:start position:0%
numeration in the CFR 45 it would
 
02:56:09.510 --> 02:56:09.520 align:start position:0%
stipulate that veterans disability
 
02:56:12.349 --> 02:56:12.359 align:start position:0%
compensation is part of that award no it
 
02:56:15.229 --> 02:56:15.239 align:start position:0%
is not it can't be utilized it's a play
 
02:56:17.110 --> 02:56:17.120 align:start position:0%
on words the other thing that I like my
 
02:56:18.870 --> 02:56:18.880 align:start position:0%
brothers if they're listening all you
 
02:56:20.550 --> 02:56:20.560 align:start position:0%
need to please stop calling what you
 
02:56:22.389 --> 02:56:22.399 align:start position:0%
receive as income because it's not
 
02:56:25.389 --> 02:56:25.399 align:start position:0%
income it's disability compensation it's
 
02:56:27.910 --> 02:56:27.920 align:start position:0%
a term used for the pra you look up
 
02:56:31.110 --> 02:56:31.120 align:start position:0%
Black's Law I don't work again could
 
02:56:32.870 --> 02:56:32.880 align:start position:0%

and I'm here to strongly support Senate
 
03:00:19.359 --> 03:00:20.510 align:start position:0%

03:00:20.510 --> 03:00:20.520 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
03:00:25.349 --> 03:00:25.359 align:start position:0%
295 um the um during the short tenure of
 
03:00:27.510 --> 03:00:27.520 align:start position:0%
the office of child advocate they've
 
03:00:30.429 --> 03:00:30.439 align:start position:0%
really in uh demonstrated um a level of
 
03:00:32.710 --> 03:00:32.720 align:start position:0%
Independence and integrity and
 
03:00:35.670 --> 03:00:35.680 align:start position:0%
transparency to hold us all as a state
 
03:00:37.429 --> 03:00:37.439 align:start position:0%
collectively accountable for making
 
03:00:40.030 --> 03:00:40.040 align:start position:0%
needed improvements in our um child
 
03:00:42.229 --> 03:00:42.239 align:start position:0%
protective and Juvenile Justice
 
03:00:46.309 --> 03:00:46.319 align:start position:0%
System the um and based on my own
 
03:00:48.630 --> 03:00:48.640 align:start position:0%
personal and professional experience
 
03:00:51.630 --> 03:00:51.640 align:start position:0%
I think that the that our families and
 
03:00:56.110 --> 03:00:56.120 align:start position:0%
vulnerable children um often um don't
 
03:00:59.190 --> 03:00:59.200 align:start position:0%
operate in isolation to specific systems
 
03:01:01.830 --> 03:01:01.840 align:start position:0%
and many kids and families are caught in
 
03:01:04.590 --> 03:01:04.600 align:start position:0%
gaps and barriers between systems and we
 
03:01:07.349 --> 03:01:07.359 align:start position:0%
see that all the time um at Nami New
 
03:01:08.710 --> 03:01:08.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire through our information
 
03:01:10.710 --> 03:01:10.720 align:start position:0%
resource line and and some of the work
 
03:01:13.150 --> 03:01:13.160 align:start position:0%
that we do with families and I think
 
03:01:15.070 --> 03:01:15.080 align:start position:0%
that it's not just um children and
 
03:01:17.349 --> 03:01:17.359 align:start position:0%
families that get caught it is um some
 
03:01:18.910 --> 03:01:18.920 align:start position:0%
of our really knowledgeable and
 
03:01:21.229 --> 03:01:21.239 align:start position:0%
effective and caring service providers
 
03:01:23.389 --> 03:01:23.399 align:start position:0%
they're unable to proceed with what
 
03:01:26.309 --> 03:01:26.319 align:start position:0%
would be most helpful for um a
 
03:01:28.469 --> 03:01:28.479 align:start position:0%
vulnerable child and family because of
 
03:01:32.790 --> 03:01:32.800 align:start position:0%
these systems barriers and gaps um and
 
03:01:34.990 --> 03:01:35.000 align:start position:0%
we've seen firsthand I've seen firsthand
 
03:01:36.750 --> 03:01:36.760 align:start position:0%
the effectiveness of the office of child
 
03:01:39.590 --> 03:01:39.600 align:start position:0%
advocate to investigate um assess and
 
03:01:41.990 --> 03:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
make recommendations relative to
 
03:01:44.830 --> 03:01:44.840 align:start position:0%
promoting cross systems Co collaboration
 
03:01:47.630 --> 03:01:47.640 align:start position:0%
and resolution on challenging issues
 
03:01:51.070 --> 03:01:51.080 align:start position:0%
that are faced um by children and
 
03:01:53.349 --> 03:01:53.359 align:start position:0%
families and I believe that expanding
 
03:01:54.990 --> 03:01:55.000 align:start position:0%
the reach of the office of child
 
03:01:58.309 --> 03:01:58.319 align:start position:0%
advocate um as included in this law to
 
03:02:01.349 --> 03:02:01.359 align:start position:0%
include suicide and psychological injury
 
03:02:04.110 --> 03:02:04.120 align:start position:0%
and risk and other critical incidents um
 
03:02:06.990 --> 03:02:07.000 align:start position:0%
that are listed in the in the bill many
 
03:02:09.790 --> 03:02:09.800 align:start position:0%
with um you know with certainly mental
 
03:02:13.349 --> 03:02:13.359 align:start position:0%
health impacts and Trauma um with them
 
03:02:16.389 --> 03:02:16.399 align:start position:0%
and um and will be really helpful I also
 
03:02:18.110 --> 03:02:18.120 align:start position:0%
believe it's consistent with the goal of
 
03:02:19.990 --> 03:02:20.000 align:start position:0%
the 10-year mental health plan from
 
03:02:20.000 --> 03:02:21.349 align:start position:0%
the 10-year mental health plan from
January

03:02:21.349 --> 03:02:21.359 align:start position:0%
January
 
03:02:25.590 --> 03:02:25.600 align:start position:0%
2019 and um specifically the the
 
03:02:28.830 --> 03:02:28.840 align:start position:0%
recommendations relative to coordinated
 
03:02:31.790 --> 03:02:31.800 align:start position:0%
Continuum of Care and uh and that
 
03:02:33.750 --> 03:02:33.760 align:start position:0%
particular part of the plan talks about
 
03:02:35.269 --> 03:02:35.279 align:start position:0%
the integration of the Department of
 
03:02:37.429 --> 03:02:37.439 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services and other
 
03:02:39.990 --> 03:02:40.000 align:start position:0%
state agencies um the system of care the
 
03:02:42.510 --> 03:02:42.520 align:start position:0%
governor's Commission on alcohol school
 
03:02:45.429 --> 03:02:45.439 align:start position:0%
safety um preparedness and and other
 
03:02:46.870 --> 03:02:46.880 align:start position:0%
things and I think that the office of
 
03:02:50.550 --> 03:02:50.560 align:start position:0%
child advocate would be very helpful in
 
03:02:53.110 --> 03:02:53.120 align:start position:0%
um in bringing those different systems
 
03:02:55.830 --> 03:02:55.840 align:start position:0%
together and providing that level of
 
03:02:59.990 --> 03:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
accountability um and um and connection
 
03:03:02.389 --> 03:03:02.399 align:start position:0%
that is is needed and then lastly I
 
03:03:03.790 --> 03:03:03.800 align:start position:0%
would just say that I think it's
 
03:03:06.469 --> 03:03:06.479 align:start position:0%
particularly important as we look toward
 
03:03:08.429 --> 03:03:08.439 align:start position:0%
the the vulnerability of Children and
 
03:03:11.389 --> 03:03:11.399 align:start position:0%
Family relative to the covid environment
 
03:03:13.429 --> 03:03:13.439 align:start position:0%
that we're in and the budget pressures
 
03:03:16.469 --> 03:03:16.479 align:start position:0%
that are sure to follow and uh certainly
 
03:03:18.870 --> 03:03:18.880 align:start position:0%
are going to have severe impacts on our
 
03:03:22.389 --> 03:03:22.399 align:start position:0%
children and families um so Nami New
 
03:03:23.750 --> 03:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire strongly believes this
 
03:03:26.110 --> 03:03:26.120 align:start position:0%
legislation can dramatically improve the
 
03:03:28.110 --> 03:03:28.120 align:start position:0%
safety net for children and families in
 
03:03:30.870 --> 03:03:30.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and I I thank you for your
 
03:03:33.590 --> 03:03:33.600 align:start position:0%

able to hear us that's okay my question
 
03:03:54.990 --> 03:03:55.000 align:start position:0%
was just for the first speaker to repeat
 
03:03:56.229 --> 03:03:56.239 align:start position:0%
their Nam so I could have it for the
 
03:04:00.070 --> 03:04:00.080 align:start position:0%
record oh Ken Norton no the prior one
 
03:04:03.429 --> 03:04:03.439 align:start position:0%
who introduced that was that was uh
 
03:04:06.590 --> 03:04:06.600 align:start position:0%
staff um Cameron
 
03:04:11.070 --> 03:04:11.080 align:start position:0%

I only see one other hand one other hand
 
03:04:22.110 --> 03:04:22.120 align:start position:0%
up to testify and and that's

um later on okay I just got wiped out
 
03:04:41.389 --> 03:04:41.399 align:start position:0%
here so I don't
 
03:04:44.389 --> 03:04:44.399 align:start position:0%

James buffetti uh associate Ag
 
03:04:53.349 --> 03:04:53.359 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice uh Mr
 
03:04:55.469 --> 03:04:55.479 align:start position:0%

public listed to testify on this hello
you

03:05:00.389 --> 03:05:00.399 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:05:03.309 --> 03:05:03.319 align:start position:0%
okay goad Mr buffetti yes can you hear
 
03:05:07.550 --> 03:05:07.560 align:start position:0%
me yes good afternoon uh Mr chairman
 
03:05:08.790 --> 03:05:08.800 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is
 
03:05:11.550 --> 03:05:11.560 align:start position:0%
James buffetti I'm an associate attorney
 
03:05:16.070 --> 03:05:16.080 align:start position:0%
general and um so I'm hoping that the
 
03:05:20.670 --> 03:05:20.680 align:start position:0%
letter that we sent in on February to
 
03:05:23.910 --> 03:05:23.920 align:start position:0%
the chairman has made its way to the
 
03:05:26.550 --> 03:05:26.560 align:start position:0%
committee uh it um highlights the
 
03:05:28.670 --> 03:05:28.680 align:start position:0%
concerns that the Department of Justice
 
03:05:29.950 --> 03:05:29.960 align:start position:0%
has with this
 
03:05:33.150 --> 03:05:33.160 align:start position:0%
legislation I'm testifying in opposition
 
03:05:35.309 --> 03:05:35.319 align:start position:0%
uh but I don't want that to detract in
 
03:05:38.510 --> 03:05:38.520 align:start position:0%
any way uh from the important and
 
03:05:41.030 --> 03:05:41.040 align:start position:0%
critical work that the office of the
 
03:05:43.229 --> 03:05:43.239 align:start position:0%
child advocate does every day and we
 
03:05:45.510 --> 03:05:45.520 align:start position:0%
support that uh there are there is some
 
03:05:50.070 --> 03:05:50.080 align:start position:0%
language in that bill that creates some
 
03:05:53.710 --> 03:05:53.720 align:start position:0%
um significant concern having to do with
 
03:05:56.429 --> 03:05:56.439 align:start position:0%
uh accountability uh and
 
03:05:59.670 --> 03:05:59.680 align:start position:0%
oversight so uh primarily there's
 
03:06:02.269 --> 03:06:02.279 align:start position:0%
language in the bill that says the
 
03:06:05.349 --> 03:06:05.359 align:start position:0%
office shall notwithstanding any other
 
03:06:07.550 --> 03:06:07.560 align:start position:0%
provision of law operate with full
 
03:06:10.429 --> 03:06:10.439 align:start position:0%
independence from any state official
 
03:06:12.990 --> 03:06:13.000 align:start position:0%
department or agency in the performance
 
03:06:14.349 --> 03:06:14.359 align:start position:0%
of its
 
03:06:19.070 --> 03:06:19.080 align:start position:0%
duties that language uh as uh if if
 
03:06:22.750 --> 03:06:22.760 align:start position:0%
properly understood would uh remove any
 
03:06:24.550 --> 03:06:24.560 align:start position:0%
accountability and oversight for the
 
03:06:26.630 --> 03:06:26.640 align:start position:0%
child advocate even from the governor
 
03:06:29.429 --> 03:06:29.439 align:start position:0%
and the Attorney General um as as you
 
03:06:32.389 --> 03:06:32.399 align:start position:0%
know under our system executive power is
 
03:06:35.389 --> 03:06:35.399 align:start position:0%
vested in the governor who was elected
 
03:06:40.790 --> 03:06:40.800 align:start position:0%
um by the people to uh to uh uh Faith to
 
03:06:43.030 --> 03:06:43.040 align:start position:0%
make sure that the laws are Faithfully
 
03:06:45.910 --> 03:06:45.920 align:start position:0%
executed um this agency is an executive
 
03:06:48.389 --> 03:06:48.399 align:start position:0%
branch agency uh in addition the
 
03:06:50.550 --> 03:06:50.560 align:start position:0%
Attorney General is the chief law
 
03:06:52.910 --> 03:06:52.920 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer and has statutory
 
03:06:55.469 --> 03:06:55.479 align:start position:0%
authority to make sure that all
 
03:06:58.630 --> 03:06:58.640 align:start position:0%
executive branch agencies and officers
 
03:07:00.870 --> 03:07:00.880 align:start position:0%
perform their duties according to the
 
03:07:03.190 --> 03:07:03.200 align:start position:0%
law uh that's very important to make
 
03:07:05.269 --> 03:07:05.279 align:start position:0%
sure that uh we continue to be in
 
03:07:07.990 --> 03:07:08.000 align:start position:0%
compliance with the law that we we that
 
03:07:10.750 --> 03:07:10.760 align:start position:0%
we minimize litigation risks against the
 
03:07:15.150 --> 03:07:15.160 align:start position:0%
state um and um and finally judges and
 
03:07:17.630 --> 03:07:17.640 align:start position:0%
courts um are charged with with
 
03:07:20.309 --> 03:07:20.319 align:start position:0%
resolving disputes but if you read that
 
03:07:20.319 --> 03:07:22.030 align:start position:0%
resolving disputes but if you read that
language

03:07:22.030 --> 03:07:22.040 align:start position:0%
language
 
03:07:24.910 --> 03:07:24.920 align:start position:0%
literally uh it's suggesting that the
 
03:07:27.710 --> 03:07:27.720 align:start position:0%
office of child advocate would be exempt
 
03:07:30.510 --> 03:07:30.520 align:start position:0%
from those provisions of law from the
 
03:07:31.910 --> 03:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
Executive Branch from the attorney
 
03:07:34.070 --> 03:07:34.080 align:start position:0%
generals and from the courts which is
 
03:07:37.030 --> 03:07:37.040 align:start position:0%
fundamental to our system of government
 
03:07:39.990 --> 03:07:40.000 align:start position:0%
uh so we have been raising this issue uh
 
03:07:42.349 --> 03:07:42.359 align:start position:0%
for quite a while now since 2019 when
 
03:07:45.429 --> 03:07:45.439 align:start position:0%
this bill was first uh brought forward
 
03:07:48.990 --> 03:07:49.000 align:start position:0%
in the in the Senate um in a sense this
 
03:07:51.190 --> 03:07:51.200 align:start position:0%
language would create the office of
 
03:07:54.030 --> 03:07:54.040 align:start position:0%
child advocate as an unaccountable
 
03:07:56.870 --> 03:07:56.880 align:start position:0%
fourth branch of government uh and it
 
03:07:59.590 --> 03:07:59.600 align:start position:0%
raises concerns uh I think there are
 
03:08:02.070 --> 03:08:02.080 align:start position:0%
ways there is language that we can make
 
03:08:05.590 --> 03:08:05.600 align:start position:0%
sure that that office is uh independent
 
03:08:08.349 --> 03:08:08.359 align:start position:0%
and can do the critical work that it has
 
03:08:12.190 --> 03:08:12.200 align:start position:0%
to do without at the same time uh in
 
03:08:14.590 --> 03:08:14.600 align:start position:0%
putting into a statute language that is
 
03:08:16.429 --> 03:08:16.439 align:start position:0%
contrary to the Constitution and
 
03:08:19.030 --> 03:08:19.040 align:start position:0%
contrary to concept of good
 
03:08:21.910 --> 03:08:21.920 align:start position:0%
government um there are other issues
 
03:08:23.429 --> 03:08:23.439 align:start position:0%
that are in the letter that I hope that
 
03:08:25.590 --> 03:08:25.600 align:start position:0%
you'll have a chance to look at U the
 
03:08:28.790 --> 03:08:28.800 align:start position:0%
bill does entrust the office of child
 
03:08:31.870 --> 03:08:31.880 align:start position:0%
advocate with Broad and unfed discretion
 
03:08:34.030 --> 03:08:34.040 align:start position:0%
to for example investigate the actions
 
03:08:38.110 --> 03:08:38.120 align:start position:0%
of any agency any agency in the state um
 
03:08:40.750 --> 03:08:40.760 align:start position:0%
investigate and issue subpoenas relating
 
03:08:43.910 --> 03:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
to any media report of a child that's
 
03:08:46.670 --> 03:08:46.680 align:start position:0%
the standard if uh if there was a media
 
03:08:49.910 --> 03:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
report uh regarding a child the this
 
03:08:51.830 --> 03:08:51.840 align:start position:0%
bill would give the child advocate the
 
03:08:53.590 --> 03:08:53.600 align:start position:0%
authority to issue
 
03:08:57.150 --> 03:08:57.160 align:start position:0%
subpoenas um and finally uh we rais an
 
03:09:01.269 --> 03:09:01.279 align:start position:0%
issue about access to autopsy reports uh
 
03:09:04.269 --> 03:09:04.279 align:start position:0%
and in some cases autopsy reports uh
 
03:09:07.190 --> 03:09:07.200 align:start position:0%
that involved homicides um and the
 
03:09:10.469 --> 03:09:10.479 align:start position:0%
problem with the language is that the
 
03:09:14.110 --> 03:09:14.120 align:start position:0%
that the bill would permit uh the office
 
03:09:16.750 --> 03:09:16.760 align:start position:0%
of child advocate to disclose
 
03:09:19.269 --> 03:09:19.279 align:start position:0%
confidential information contained in a
 
03:09:24.349 --> 03:09:24.359 align:start position:0%
homicide autopsy report um without any
 
03:09:26.830 --> 03:09:26.840 align:start position:0%
uh check by the Department of Justice
 
03:09:29.229 --> 03:09:29.239 align:start position:0%
that provision has the potential to
 
03:09:31.070 --> 03:09:31.080 align:start position:0%
jeopardize sensitive criminal
 
03:09:33.229 --> 03:09:33.239 align:start position:0%
investigations and in fact could impinge
 
03:09:35.990 --> 03:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
on a defendant's right to a fair
 
03:09:38.870 --> 03:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
trial that's my testimony Mr chairman
 
03:09:40.190 --> 03:09:40.200 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to answer
 
03:09:42.830 --> 03:09:42.840 align:start position:0%
questions thank you attorney buetti are
 
03:09:45.190 --> 03:09:45.200 align:start position:0%
there any
 
03:09:47.550 --> 03:09:47.560 align:start position:0%
questions I don't see any questions from
 
03:09:51.910 --> 03:09:51.920 align:start position:0%
the committee uh I do representative
 
03:09:54.670 --> 03:09:54.680 align:start position:0%
jerus thank you I'm sorry I I could
 
03:09:58.590 --> 03:09:58.600 align:start position:0%
digitally raise my hand fast enough um
 
03:09:59.710 --> 03:09:59.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question thank
 
03:10:02.110 --> 03:10:02.120 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair um I'm wondering so is
 
03:10:04.590 --> 03:10:04.600 align:start position:0%
there um the language that you were
 
03:10:06.550 --> 03:10:06.560 align:start position:0%
concerned about at the beginning about
 
03:10:08.550 --> 03:10:08.560 align:start position:0%
you said almost establishing a a fourth
 
03:10:10.590 --> 03:10:10.600 align:start position:0%
branch of government um is that
 
03:10:12.469 --> 03:10:12.479 align:start position:0%
something that you see could be uh
 
03:10:15.670 --> 03:10:15.680 align:start position:0%
remedied by moderately simple amendment
 
03:10:17.590 --> 03:10:17.600 align:start position:0%
is there a simple language change that
 
03:10:19.309 --> 03:10:19.319 align:start position:0%
you would see that could make it so that
 
03:10:21.070 --> 03:10:21.080 align:start position:0%
we're not that there's still some
 
03:10:23.550 --> 03:10:23.560 align:start position:0%
Independence but it's not completely
 
03:10:25.550 --> 03:10:25.560 align:start position:0%
unaccountable to any branch of
 
03:10:27.790 --> 03:10:27.800 align:start position:0%
government oh I'm I'm sure there's ways
 
03:10:30.150 --> 03:10:30.160 align:start position:0%
of doing that and you know we've we've
 
03:10:31.790 --> 03:10:31.800 align:start position:0%
of I don't have language today to
 
03:10:34.590 --> 03:10:34.600 align:start position:0%
propose but I I I think if the intent is
 
03:10:36.309 --> 03:10:36.319 align:start position:0%
that we want this office to be
 
03:10:40.070 --> 03:10:40.080 align:start position:0%
independent in that it can investigate
 
03:10:42.790 --> 03:10:42.800 align:start position:0%
uh state agencies for instance dcyf if
 
03:10:44.229 --> 03:10:44.239 align:start position:0%
there's an issue and that's what that's
 
03:10:47.030 --> 03:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
what this office is doing so well now uh
 
03:10:48.630 --> 03:10:48.640 align:start position:0%
that they should be able to do that and
 
03:10:52.190 --> 03:10:52.200 align:start position:0%
have the independence to do that um this
 
03:10:55.110 --> 03:10:55.120 align:start position:0%
language simply goes too far uh because
 
03:10:56.870 --> 03:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
uh of of the reasons that I stated
 
03:10:58.990 --> 03:10:59.000 align:start position:0%
before thank
 
03:11:02.429 --> 03:11:02.439 align:start position:0%
you uh representative
 
03:11:04.870 --> 03:11:04.880 align:start position:0%
Baran representative Baran you're a
 
03:11:07.550 --> 03:11:07.560 align:start position:0%

03:11:20.950 --> 03:11:20.960 align:start position:0%
had all questioned out and we have uh so
 
03:11:23.150 --> 03:11:23.160 align:start position:0%

03:11:24.190 --> 03:11:24.200 align:start position:0%

you're wel uh actually representative
 
03:12:10.750 --> 03:12:10.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:13.429 --> 03:12:13.439 align:start position:0%
question representative horn thank you
 
03:12:15.229 --> 03:12:15.239 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and thank you for taking my
 
03:12:18.150 --> 03:12:18.160 align:start position:0%
question sir uh
 
03:12:19.190 --> 03:12:19.200 align:start position:0%
has there
 
03:12:21.150 --> 03:12:21.160 align:start position:0%
been any
 
03:12:24.710 --> 03:12:24.720 align:start position:0%
difficulties with the AG and the office
 
03:12:27.660 --> 03:12:27.670 align:start position:0%
of the child advocate exchanging
 
03:12:27.670 --> 03:12:29.030 align:start position:0%
of the child advocate exchanging
[Music]

03:12:29.030 --> 03:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:12:33.750 --> 03:12:33.760 align:start position:0%
information um well the we've we uh we
 
03:12:36.630 --> 03:12:36.640 align:start position:0%
actually represent the office of child
 
03:12:39.309 --> 03:12:39.319 align:start position:0%
advocate so we have an attorney here who
 
03:12:44.269 --> 03:12:44.279 align:start position:0%
works closely with the office um so the
 
03:12:45.870 --> 03:12:45.880 align:start position:0%
information wouldn't be exchanged
 
03:12:48.670 --> 03:12:48.680 align:start position:0%
between us and and and the office uh
 
03:12:50.309 --> 03:12:50.319 align:start position:0%
usually the information that she's
 
03:12:52.269 --> 03:12:52.279 align:start position:0%
looking for would be information from
 
03:12:54.830 --> 03:12:54.840 align:start position:0%
dcyf and from other social agencies I
 
03:12:56.670 --> 03:12:56.680 align:start position:0%
don't think there's been a problem I do
 
03:12:58.830 --> 03:12:58.840 align:start position:0%
think that that there may be cases where
 
03:13:01.190 --> 03:13:01.200 align:start position:0%
we need to provide legal guidance we're
 
03:13:03.550 --> 03:13:03.560 align:start position:0%
we're we're obligated to do that with
 
03:13:06.670 --> 03:13:06.680 align:start position:0%
not only that executive agency but every
 
03:13:11.110 --> 03:13:11.120 align:start position:0%
agency so we provide attorneys who are
 
03:13:13.030 --> 03:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
essentially client counselors who work
 
03:13:15.469 --> 03:13:15.479 align:start position:0%
with agencies to make sure that the
 
03:13:18.349 --> 03:13:18.359 align:start position:0%
agencies are complying with with law and
 
03:13:20.630 --> 03:13:20.640 align:start position:0%
so issues come up about right to know
 
03:13:23.269 --> 03:13:23.279 align:start position:0%
questions and Personnel issues and other
 
03:13:25.309 --> 03:13:25.319 align:start position:0%
issues that we will work with all our
 
03:13:27.469 --> 03:13:27.479 align:start position:0%
clients with to make sure that we are
 
03:13:29.830 --> 03:13:29.840 align:start position:0%
minimizing risk of litigation we would
 
03:13:31.630 --> 03:13:31.640 align:start position:0%
do the same thing with the office of
 
03:13:33.910 --> 03:13:33.920 align:start position:0%
child advocate as we would do with every
 
03:13:35.990 --> 03:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
other state
 
03:13:39.269 --> 03:13:39.279 align:start position:0%
agency uh followup representative thank
 
03:13:41.389 --> 03:13:41.399 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman I'm reminded of the
 
03:13:43.229 --> 03:13:43.239 align:start position:0%
passage in the Bible that says a man
 
03:13:46.349 --> 03:13:46.359 align:start position:0%
cannot serve two masters and I'm
 
03:13:47.550 --> 03:13:47.560 align:start position:0%
wondering if
 
03:13:50.469 --> 03:13:50.479 align:start position:0%
if there are situations where there
 
03:13:52.670 --> 03:13:52.680 align:start position:0%
would be a conflict of interest where
 
03:13:54.269 --> 03:13:54.279 align:start position:0%
the office of the child advocate is
 
03:13:55.790 --> 03:13:55.800 align:start position:0%
asking questions of
 
03:13:59.030 --> 03:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
DCF but because they're in the Office of
 
03:14:02.750 --> 03:14:02.760 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General they can DCF can
 
03:14:04.710 --> 03:14:04.720 align:start position:0%
claim client privilege against answering
 
03:14:05.990 --> 03:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
them because they're being represented
 
03:14:09.150 --> 03:14:09.160 align:start position:0%
by DCF by uh AG
 
03:14:12.990 --> 03:14:13.000 align:start position:0%
attorneys so we we oftentimes have uh
 
03:14:16.550 --> 03:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
have clients on different sides of of of
 
03:14:16.560 --> 03:14:17.630 align:start position:0%
have clients on different sides of of of
issues

03:14:17.630 --> 03:14:17.640 align:start position:0%
issues
 
03:14:21.110 --> 03:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
uh we would have a separate attorney who
 
03:14:22.870 --> 03:14:22.880 align:start position:0%
would be working with the office of
 
03:14:26.309 --> 03:14:26.319 align:start position:0%
child advocate from attorneys that would
 
03:14:28.229 --> 03:14:28.239 align:start position:0%
be working with the Department of Health
 
03:14:32.190 --> 03:14:32.200 align:start position:0%
and Human Services and DCF so we because
 
03:14:34.790 --> 03:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
we're called on to represent every state
 
03:14:37.830 --> 03:14:37.840 align:start position:0%
agency we would we would separate out
 
03:14:40.670 --> 03:14:40.680 align:start position:0%
lawyers who could represent the and will
 
03:14:42.950 --> 03:14:42.960 align:start position:0%
represent the office of child advocate
 
03:14:45.110 --> 03:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
they will not be involved with
 
03:14:49.750 --> 03:14:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:52.190 --> 03:14:52.200 align:start position:0%
Al so representative another followup
 
03:14:54.229 --> 03:14:54.239 align:start position:0%
representative horn thank you Mr
 
03:14:59.110 --> 03:14:59.120 align:start position:0%
chairman sorry about that um so even if
 
03:15:02.229 --> 03:15:02.239 align:start position:0%
we move the office of the child advocate
 
03:15:03.790 --> 03:15:03.800 align:start position:0%
out from underneath the Attorney
 
03:15:06.389 --> 03:15:06.399 align:start position:0%
General's office you would continue to
 
03:15:08.309 --> 03:15:08.319 align:start position:0%
represent them as they're an executive
 
03:15:08.319 --> 03:15:10.670 align:start position:0%
represent them as they're an executive
branch

03:15:10.670 --> 03:15:10.680 align:start position:0%
branch
 
03:15:12.870 --> 03:15:12.880 align:start position:0%
office the bill wouldn't this bill
 
03:15:15.110 --> 03:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
wouldn't change that
 
03:15:16.950 --> 03:15:16.960 align:start position:0%
situation thank you for your question
 
03:15:18.630 --> 03:15:18.640 align:start position:0%
representative actually the office of
 
03:15:20.590 --> 03:15:20.600 align:start position:0%
child advocate is not a part of the
 
03:15:23.389 --> 03:15:23.399 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office so I if I was
 
03:15:26.269 --> 03:15:26.279 align:start position:0%
I I was understood to to say that I I I
 
03:15:28.150 --> 03:15:28.160 align:start position:0%
apologize that's not what I was saying
 
03:15:31.189 --> 03:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
what I was saying is that every state
 
03:15:33.389 --> 03:15:33.399 align:start position:0%
every executive branch
 
03:15:37.710 --> 03:15:37.720 align:start position:0%
agency uh is is supervised by Statute by
 
03:15:40.510 --> 03:15:40.520 align:start position:0%
law by the Attorney General to make sure
 
03:15:42.070 --> 03:15:42.080 align:start position:0%
that they're performing their duties
 
03:15:44.830 --> 03:15:44.840 align:start position:0%
according to the law so every agencies
 
03:15:47.189 --> 03:15:47.199 align:start position:0%
meaning the the Department of Safety and
 
03:15:49.469 --> 03:15:49.479 align:start position:0%
the Department of Transportation the
 
03:15:52.710 --> 03:15:52.720 align:start position:0%
office of child advocate we uh we work
 
03:15:56.189 --> 03:15:56.199 align:start position:0%
with every agency uh to make sure that
 
03:15:58.309 --> 03:15:58.319 align:start position:0%
they are complying with the law but but
 
03:16:00.070 --> 03:16:00.080 align:start position:0%
but the office of child advocate is not
 
03:16:02.389 --> 03:16:02.399 align:start position:0%
a part of the Department of Justice in
 
03:16:05.389 --> 03:16:05.399 align:start position:0%
in the sense I think you you minut
 
03:16:07.990 --> 03:16:08.000 align:start position:0%

buff um
 
03:16:19.269 --> 03:16:19.279 align:start position:0%
I have seen the in the past last year
 
03:16:22.349 --> 03:16:22.359 align:start position:0%
the ability of committees in an office
 
03:16:26.110 --> 03:16:26.120 align:start position:0%
like um child advocate having the
 
03:16:32.429 --> 03:16:32.439 align:start position:0%
authority to um do subpoenas when
 
03:16:36.429 --> 03:16:36.439 align:start position:0%
necessary do do they come to the
 
03:16:40.189 --> 03:16:40.199 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office to ask for
 
03:16:43.070 --> 03:16:43.080 align:start position:0%
Counsel on such things or do they are
 
03:16:46.269 --> 03:16:46.279 align:start position:0%
they able to work within the law to um
 
03:16:49.550 --> 03:16:49.560 align:start position:0%
determine the appropriateness of
 
03:16:53.189 --> 03:16:53.199 align:start position:0%
that so the statute doesn't require them
 
03:16:57.189 --> 03:16:57.199 align:start position:0%
to come to us um they certainly can and
 
03:16:58.630 --> 03:16:58.640 align:start position:0%
a lot of state agencies who have
 
03:17:00.830 --> 03:17:00.840 align:start position:0%
subpoena power that's given by the
 
03:17:03.030 --> 03:17:03.040 align:start position:0%
legislature uh will want to consult with
 
03:17:04.870 --> 03:17:04.880 align:start position:0%
us because sometimes legal issues come
 
03:17:08.670 --> 03:17:08.680 align:start position:0%
up um but they're not required to do so
 
03:17:12.110 --> 03:17:12.120 align:start position:0%
uh and uh but we are certainly here to
 
03:17:14.910 --> 03:17:14.920 align:start position:0%
assist um the office of child advocate
 
03:17:17.189 --> 03:17:17.199 align:start position:0%
if they have questions like that and
 
03:17:19.630 --> 03:17:19.640 align:start position:0%
want us to to help them with it
 
03:17:21.429 --> 03:17:21.439 align:start position:0%
wonderful thank
 
03:17:24.349 --> 03:17:24.359 align:start position:0%
you uh representative
 
03:17:26.630 --> 03:17:26.640 align:start position:0%
yella yes thank you and thank you for
 
03:17:30.790 --> 03:17:30.800 align:start position:0%
taking my question um so you have uh
 
03:17:34.389 --> 03:17:34.399 align:start position:0%
multiple attorneys that would be able to
 
03:17:37.229 --> 03:17:37.239 align:start position:0%
um represent each side without having a
 
03:17:41.030 --> 03:17:41.040 align:start position:0%
conflict and is it also your position
 
03:17:44.349 --> 03:17:44.359 align:start position:0%
that you have no um oversight role
 
03:17:47.429 --> 03:17:47.439 align:start position:0%
currently on the uh
 
03:17:49.870 --> 03:17:49.880 align:start position:0%
Office of the child
 
03:17:51.870 --> 03:17:51.880 align:start position:0%
advocate No in
 
03:17:56.070 --> 03:17:56.080 align:start position:0%
fact so no in fact if you uh if you look
 
03:17:58.870 --> 03:17:58.880 align:start position:0%
at RSA 21 colon
 
03:18:01.550 --> 03:18:01.560 align:start position:0%
3B uh that's the statute that says that
 
03:18:03.830 --> 03:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
the attorney general has the authority
 
03:18:05.950 --> 03:18:05.960 align:start position:0%
to ensure that all executive branch
 
03:18:07.550 --> 03:18:07.560 align:start position:0%
agencies and officers perform their
 
03:18:10.150 --> 03:18:10.160 align:start position:0%
duties according to the law so it's from
 
03:18:14.030 --> 03:18:14.040 align:start position:0%
that from that uh perspective by law
 
03:18:16.189 --> 03:18:16.199 align:start position:0%
that we are supposed to that is what
 
03:18:18.030 --> 03:18:18.040 align:start position:0%
we're supposed to be doing here uh
 
03:18:21.630 --> 03:18:21.640 align:start position:0%
provide guidance uh because uh part of
 
03:18:24.269 --> 03:18:24.279 align:start position:0%
it is to avoid problems you know we we
 
03:18:27.309 --> 03:18:27.319 align:start position:0%
we work with clients to to to minimize
 
03:18:30.469 --> 03:18:30.479 align:start position:0%
litigation risks you know this office
 
03:18:32.830 --> 03:18:32.840 align:start position:0%
especially is dealing with high-profile
 
03:18:35.950 --> 03:18:35.960 align:start position:0%
very difficult cases and so we want to
 
03:18:38.950 --> 03:18:38.960 align:start position:0%
make sure that we minimize any
 
03:18:41.870 --> 03:18:41.880 align:start position:0%
litigation risk for the state in all
 
03:18:44.229 --> 03:18:44.239 align:start position:0%
agencies and we do that by being
 
03:18:47.710 --> 03:18:47.720 align:start position:0%
proactive with attorneys who are client
 
03:18:50.870 --> 03:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
act as client counselors for the state
 
03:18:53.510 --> 03:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
agencies and we regularly uh interact
 
03:18:56.269 --> 03:18:56.279 align:start position:0%
with them on a daily basis to make sure
 
03:18:57.670 --> 03:18:57.680 align:start position:0%
that we answer their questions and
 
03:18:59.710 --> 03:18:59.720 align:start position:0%
assist them uh and then if the state
 
03:19:02.389 --> 03:19:02.399 align:start position:0%
gets sued then we would represent the
 
03:19:05.670 --> 03:19:05.680 align:start position:0%
state in defending those actions so but
 
03:19:07.429 --> 03:19:07.439 align:start position:0%
the goal is to prevent the state from
 
03:19:09.590 --> 03:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
getting sued in the first instance and
 
03:19:12.590 --> 03:19:12.600 align:start position:0%
we do that by exercising the statutory
 
03:19:16.950 --> 03:19:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:21.429 --> 03:19:21.439 align:start position:0%
uh very good uh uh representative Weber
 
03:19:23.309 --> 03:19:23.319 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you very
 
03:19:26.309 --> 03:19:26.319 align:start position:0%
much for taking my question I'm I'm
 
03:19:28.070 --> 03:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
harking back to the very beginning of
 
03:19:30.710 --> 03:19:30.720 align:start position:0%
your testimony when you said you
 
03:19:33.429 --> 03:19:33.439 align:start position:0%
expressed your concern with the language
 
03:19:37.910 --> 03:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
on page two lines 25 and 26
 
03:19:39.710 --> 03:19:39.720 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding any other provision of
 
03:19:41.150 --> 03:19:41.160 align:start position:0%
law they shall operate with full
 
03:19:43.510 --> 03:19:43.520 align:start position:0%
independence from any state official or
 
03:19:47.750 --> 03:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
agency um I read that as me Independence
 
03:19:51.110 --> 03:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
but was I understanding you to say that
 
03:19:54.309 --> 03:19:54.319 align:start position:0%
you are interpreting that to actually
 
03:19:59.550 --> 03:19:59.560 align:start position:0%
put this uh office Above the Law because
 
03:20:02.070 --> 03:20:02.080 align:start position:0%
that's not the way it reads to
 
03:20:06.950 --> 03:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
me uh so yes uh the the concern is that
 
03:20:08.670 --> 03:20:08.680 align:start position:0%
again not withstanding any other
 
03:20:11.309 --> 03:20:11.319 align:start position:0%
provision of law operate with full
 
03:20:13.750 --> 03:20:13.760 align:start position:0%
independence from any state official
 
03:20:15.670 --> 03:20:15.680 align:start position:0%
including the governor and the Attorney
 
03:20:18.670 --> 03:20:18.680 align:start position:0%
General any state department or agency
 
03:20:22.030 --> 03:20:22.040 align:start position:0%
in the performance of its duties so um
 
03:20:23.229 --> 03:20:23.239 align:start position:0%
where is the
 
03:20:24.950 --> 03:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
accountability uh I mean we're all
 
03:20:27.590 --> 03:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
accountable to somebody ultimately um so
 
03:20:28.710 --> 03:20:28.720 align:start position:0%
where is the
 
03:20:31.150 --> 03:20:31.160 align:start position:0%
accountability uh if it's an executive
 
03:20:34.309 --> 03:20:34.319 align:start position:0%
agency the accountability is to the
 
03:20:37.389 --> 03:20:37.399 align:start position:0%
governor and to the attorney
 
03:20:41.150 --> 03:20:41.160 align:start position:0%
general followup Mr chairman uh followup
 
03:20:43.070 --> 03:20:43.080 align:start position:0%
thank you sir and thank you again for
 
03:20:47.229 --> 03:20:47.239 align:start position:0%
taking my second question uh but my
 
03:20:52.070 --> 03:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
understanding I is it not true that if
 
03:20:56.269 --> 03:20:56.279 align:start position:0%
we remove that then it's not only
 
03:20:58.950 --> 03:20:58.960 align:start position:0%
accountability that we're
 
03:21:01.309 --> 03:21:01.319 align:start position:0%
removing and and and as I read it you
 
03:21:03.910 --> 03:21:03.920 align:start position:0%
still have accountability but if you
 
03:21:06.349 --> 03:21:06.359 align:start position:0%
remove that language then either the
 
03:21:08.990 --> 03:21:09.000 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office or the
 
03:21:12.389 --> 03:21:12.399 align:start position:0%
governor can simply tell the office of
 
03:21:15.870 --> 03:21:15.880 align:start position:0%
child advocate what they're going to do
 
03:21:18.269 --> 03:21:18.279 align:start position:0%
and how they're going to do it and the
 
03:21:22.670 --> 03:21:22.680 align:start position:0%
point here is to have somebody who is
 
03:21:24.910 --> 03:21:24.920 align:start position:0%
independent of
 
03:21:24.920 --> 03:21:26.469 align:start position:0%
independent of
that

03:21:26.469 --> 03:21:26.479 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:21:29.070 --> 03:21:29.080 align:start position:0%
uh political
 
03:21:29.080 --> 03:21:31.030 align:start position:0%
uh political
influence

03:21:31.030 --> 03:21:31.040 align:start position:0%
influence
 
03:21:35.189 --> 03:21:35.199 align:start position:0%
um but certainly not above the
 
03:21:37.710 --> 03:21:37.720 align:start position:0%
law but I think that's just the point
 
03:21:39.550 --> 03:21:39.560 align:start position:0%
representative I think that it it has
 
03:21:41.830 --> 03:21:41.840 align:start position:0%
the potential of being interpreted as
 
03:21:44.229 --> 03:21:44.239 align:start position:0%
putting this office Above the Law
 
03:21:45.349 --> 03:21:45.359 align:start position:0%
because it's not only the attorney
 
03:21:48.309 --> 03:21:48.319 align:start position:0%
general and the governor but the courts
 
03:21:50.590 --> 03:21:50.600 align:start position:0%
uh if they're completely independent
 
03:21:53.790 --> 03:21:53.800 align:start position:0%
from any state official meaning a judge
 
03:21:56.990 --> 03:21:57.000 align:start position:0%
uh then again uh we need to have
 
03:21:59.990 --> 03:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
accountability and oversight uh of of
 
03:22:00.000 --> 03:22:01.269 align:start position:0%
accountability and oversight uh of of
executive

03:22:01.269 --> 03:22:01.279 align:start position:0%
executive
 
03:22:04.229 --> 03:22:04.239 align:start position:0%
agencies uh which means that we need to
 
03:22:08.150 --> 03:22:08.160 align:start position:0%
let them do their work uh but but our
 
03:22:10.870 --> 03:22:10.880 align:start position:0%
system of government is a system of
 
03:22:13.309 --> 03:22:13.319 align:start position:0%
accountability and checks and balances
 
03:22:16.670 --> 03:22:16.680 align:start position:0%
and uh and we have to have a way to to
 
03:22:19.510 --> 03:22:19.520 align:start position:0%
say you're an executive branch official
 
03:22:22.349 --> 03:22:22.359 align:start position:0%
and as all executive branch official
 
03:22:25.389 --> 03:22:25.399 align:start position:0%
then the executive power uh of the of
 
03:22:27.229 --> 03:22:27.239 align:start position:0%
the state government is vested in the
 
03:22:28.990 --> 03:22:29.000 align:start position:0%
governor who is elected by the people
 
03:22:31.389 --> 03:22:31.399 align:start position:0%
and charged with the faithful execution
 
03:22:31.399 --> 03:22:33.269 align:start position:0%
and charged with the faithful execution
of

03:22:33.269 --> 03:22:33.279 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:22:36.550 --> 03:22:36.560 align:start position:0%
laws okay thank you uh would you be
 
03:22:39.229 --> 03:22:39.239 align:start position:0%
willing to provide some alternative
 
03:22:40.870 --> 03:22:40.880 align:start position:0%
language that you're more comfortable
 
03:22:41.870 --> 03:22:41.880 align:start position:0%
with that
 
03:22:44.070 --> 03:22:44.080 align:start position:0%
preserves what you think needs to be
 
03:22:45.830 --> 03:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
preserved while preserving to the
 
03:22:48.550 --> 03:22:48.560 align:start position:0%
maximum extent possible the independence
 
03:22:49.590 --> 03:22:49.600 align:start position:0%
of this
 
03:22:53.229 --> 03:22:53.239 align:start position:0%
agency uh I I'd be happy to work with
 
03:22:55.750 --> 03:22:55.760 align:start position:0%
and we've offered this along the way
 
03:22:57.309 --> 03:22:57.319 align:start position:0%
offer to happy to work with the
 
03:22:59.070 --> 03:22:59.080 align:start position:0%
committee with the office of child
 
03:23:01.309 --> 03:23:01.319 align:start position:0%
advocate uh to see if we can find
 
03:23:03.630 --> 03:23:03.640 align:start position:0%
language that uh that addresses the
 
03:23:05.750 --> 03:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
Independence that they clearly need to
 
03:23:07.990 --> 03:23:08.000 align:start position:0%
do their job but doesn't create a fourth
 
03:23:10.790 --> 03:23:10.800 align:start position:0%
branch of government thank

03:24:17.150 --> 03:24:17.160 align:start position:0%
to be a part of it I want to thank
 
03:24:19.110 --> 03:24:19.120 align:start position:0%
Senator Carson representative rice and
 
03:24:21.189 --> 03:24:21.199 align:start position:0%
representative Baran who are co-sponsors
 
03:24:24.710 --> 03:24:24.720 align:start position:0%
on this bill um I'll try to be um a
 
03:24:27.510 --> 03:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
brief you have my written testimony um
 
03:24:30.750 --> 03:24:30.760 align:start position:0%
but I'll Focus essentially on the two uh
 
03:24:34.150 --> 03:24:34.160 align:start position:0%
major adjustments that Senate Bill 295
 
03:24:36.150 --> 03:24:36.160 align:start position:0%
does for the child advocate statute
 
03:24:39.150 --> 03:24:39.160 align:start position:0%
which are to make Services comprehensive
 
03:24:41.630 --> 03:24:41.640 align:start position:0%
and equitably accessible for children
 
03:24:43.990 --> 03:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
and also to clarify the independence as
 
03:24:46.030 --> 03:24:46.040 align:start position:0%
you've just heard um some discussion
 
03:24:48.910 --> 03:24:48.920 align:start position:0%
already ready um and I'll also point out
 
03:24:51.630 --> 03:24:51.640 align:start position:0%
um thanks to uh Ken Norton who mentioned
 
03:24:54.349 --> 03:24:54.359 align:start position:0%
the impending pressures of covid-19 and
 
03:24:57.189 --> 03:24:57.199 align:start position:0%
the budget issues that we see ahead um
 
03:24:58.950 --> 03:24:58.960 align:start position:0%
and remind you that the very existence
 
03:25:01.189 --> 03:25:01.199 align:start position:0%
of the office of the child advocate was
 
03:25:03.790 --> 03:25:03.800 align:start position:0%
born out of a period of user budget
 
03:25:05.990 --> 03:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
actions that resulted in really
 
03:25:09.229 --> 03:25:09.239 align:start position:0%
untenable tragedy so it's taken us a
 
03:25:11.750 --> 03:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
decade to get mamire back on track in
 
03:25:13.710 --> 03:25:13.720 align:start position:0%
just building an infrastructure for
 
03:25:15.510 --> 03:25:15.520 align:start position:0%
supporting children so the role of the
 
03:25:18.030 --> 03:25:18.040 align:start position:0%
office of the child Advocate is very
 
03:25:21.990 --> 03:25:22.000 align:start position:0%
important so the two main um adjustments
 
03:25:23.790 --> 03:25:23.800 align:start position:0%
that we're seeing first the expanding
 
03:25:25.510 --> 03:25:25.520 align:start position:0%
services for the office of the child
 
03:25:27.910 --> 03:25:27.920 align:start position:0%
advocate the the Crafters of the
 
03:25:30.870 --> 03:25:30.880 align:start position:0%
founding legislation to establish this
 
03:25:33.429 --> 03:25:33.439 align:start position:0%
office looked to Massachusetts for a
 
03:25:35.750 --> 03:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
model um but they stopped short at
 
03:25:37.670 --> 03:25:37.680 align:start position:0%
endowing the office with the breadth of
 
03:25:39.990 --> 03:25:40.000 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction that Massachusetts has and
 
03:25:42.150 --> 03:25:42.160 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that they
 
03:25:45.389 --> 03:25:45.399 align:start position:0%
anticipated a phased approach in order
 
03:25:47.510 --> 03:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
to avoid over overwhelming a brand new
 
03:25:50.790 --> 03:25:50.800 align:start position:0%
office facing a child welfare system in
 
03:25:53.389 --> 03:25:53.399 align:start position:0%
crisis um the current Massachusetts
 
03:25:56.510 --> 03:25:56.520 align:start position:0%
child advocate Maria mades explained why
 
03:25:58.670 --> 03:25:58.680 align:start position:0%
broad jurisdiction is important to us
 
03:26:01.030 --> 03:26:01.040 align:start position:0%
recently she said and I quote children
 
03:26:04.150 --> 03:26:04.160 align:start position:0%
and their families require support from
 
03:26:07.750 --> 03:26:07.760 align:start position:0%
a wide range of State services including
 
03:26:10.269 --> 03:26:10.279 align:start position:0%
education in order to grow into a
 
03:26:13.590 --> 03:26:13.600 align:start position:0%
healthy adulthood so in Massachusetts
 
03:26:16.550 --> 03:26:16.560 align:start position:0%
the OCA is the only agency that looks
 
03:26:19.110 --> 03:26:19.120 align:start position:0%
across all state services to identify
 
03:26:21.269 --> 03:26:21.279 align:start position:0%
the gaps and opportunities to ensure
 
03:26:23.269 --> 03:26:23.279 align:start position:0%
that children have what they need to
 
03:26:27.150 --> 03:26:27.160 align:start position:0%
thrive so I I I reminded that um and we
 
03:26:29.070 --> 03:26:29.080 align:start position:0%
should all be reminded that the office
 
03:26:32.269 --> 03:26:32.279 align:start position:0%
actually has no enforcement Authority
 
03:26:34.590 --> 03:26:34.600 align:start position:0%
the only Power and means of being
 
03:26:37.309 --> 03:26:37.319 align:start position:0%
effective is in access to information
 
03:26:39.110 --> 03:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
and the privilege to review that
 
03:26:41.389 --> 03:26:41.399 align:start position:0%
information to better inform all of the
 
03:26:44.229 --> 03:26:44.239 align:start position:0%
parties involved with helping a child so
 
03:26:46.830 --> 03:26:46.840 align:start position:0%
expanding the jurisdiction is really
 
03:26:50.030 --> 03:26:50.040 align:start position:0%
only expanding access to children's
 
03:26:52.830 --> 03:26:52.840 align:start position:0%
stories often the points of intersection
 
03:26:55.429 --> 03:26:55.439 align:start position:0%
where State systems meet are where
 
03:26:58.469 --> 03:26:58.479 align:start position:0%
children's needs are most effective so
 
03:27:00.469 --> 03:27:00.479 align:start position:0%
the Connecticut child advocate Sarah
 
03:27:04.150 --> 03:27:04.160 align:start position:0%
Egan also echoed what Moses had had had
 
03:27:07.349 --> 03:27:07.359 align:start position:0%
pointed out which is quote having access
 
03:27:10.790 --> 03:27:10.800 align:start position:0%
to information across state systems that
 
03:27:13.590 --> 03:27:13.600 align:start position:0%
serve children is absolutely essential
 
03:27:15.550 --> 03:27:15.560 align:start position:0%
to understanding how vulnerable
 
03:27:18.510 --> 03:27:18.520 align:start position:0%
children's need s are met or not through
 
03:27:21.590 --> 03:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
state funded services so virtually every
 
03:27:23.670 --> 03:27:23.680 align:start position:0%
report the office of the child advocate
 
03:27:26.510 --> 03:27:26.520 align:start position:0%
in Connecticut does including fatality
 
03:27:28.870 --> 03:27:28.880 align:start position:0%
investigations looks across systems so
 
03:27:30.870 --> 03:27:30.880 align:start position:0%
that they can truly understand how
 
03:27:33.870 --> 03:27:33.880 align:start position:0%
children's health safety and Welfare are
 
03:27:36.229 --> 03:27:36.239 align:start position:0%
supported and protected so both of those
 
03:27:38.429 --> 03:27:38.439 align:start position:0%
Advocates are pointing out a
 
03:27:40.510 --> 03:27:40.520 align:start position:0%
fundamentally important view of the
 
03:27:42.790 --> 03:27:42.800 align:start position:0%
functions of these office they're
 
03:27:45.550 --> 03:27:45.560 align:start position:0%
describing not how well agencies are
 
03:27:45.560 --> 03:27:46.830 align:start position:0%
describing not how well agencies are
functioning

03:27:46.830 --> 03:27:46.840 align:start position:0%
functioning
 
03:27:49.510 --> 03:27:49.520 align:start position:0%
they're describing how well children are
 
03:27:52.309 --> 03:27:52.319 align:start position:0%
served so if children are served by more
 
03:27:54.790 --> 03:27:54.800 align:start position:0%
than one agency we can't fully
 
03:27:57.269 --> 03:27:57.279 align:start position:0%
understand where the gaps are if we only
 
03:27:59.590 --> 03:27:59.600 align:start position:0%
examine a single agency's
 
03:28:01.790 --> 03:28:01.800 align:start position:0%
involvement and Egan and Connecticut
 
03:28:05.269 --> 03:28:05.279 align:start position:0%
provided a really good and and and um
 
03:28:08.990 --> 03:28:09.000 align:start position:0%
sad example of a child fatality in
 
03:28:11.790 --> 03:28:11.800 align:start position:0%
Connecticut um involving a child who had
 
03:28:15.070 --> 03:28:15.080 align:start position:0%
autism intellectual disability was
 
03:28:17.510 --> 03:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
chronically missing from school and was
 
03:28:19.630 --> 03:28:19.640 align:start position:0%
subject of a neglect petition prior to
 
03:28:22.670 --> 03:28:22.680 align:start position:0%
his death so he was known by the school
 
03:28:26.189 --> 03:28:26.199 align:start position:0%
system the courts the legal system the
 
03:28:28.710 --> 03:28:28.720 align:start position:0%
health providers and Child Protection as
 
03:28:31.750 --> 03:28:31.760 align:start position:0%
a child who needed help and protection
 
03:28:34.630 --> 03:28:34.640 align:start position:0%
by accessing information across all
 
03:28:37.510 --> 03:28:37.520 align:start position:0%
those involved state funded systems the
 
03:28:40.309 --> 03:28:40.319 align:start position:0%
Connecticut OCA was able to see the gaps
 
03:28:41.710 --> 03:28:41.720 align:start position:0%
and how they contributed to the
 
03:28:43.750 --> 03:28:43.760 align:start position:0%
circumstances that led to that boy's
 
03:28:46.670 --> 03:28:46.680 align:start position:0%
death and I've given you a citation and
 
03:28:48.830 --> 03:28:48.840 align:start position:0%
and a link to the report on that child's
 
03:28:51.590 --> 03:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
stas so this example is one that's
 
03:28:53.550 --> 03:28:53.560 align:start position:0%
consistent with actually the findings
 
03:28:55.990 --> 03:28:56.000 align:start position:0%
and recommendations of all of our
 
03:28:58.630 --> 03:28:58.640 align:start position:0%
reports to date um that show the
 
03:29:00.070 --> 03:29:00.080 align:start position:0%
necessity for
 
03:29:01.670 --> 03:29:01.680 align:start position:0%
interprofessional understanding and
 
03:29:03.510 --> 03:29:03.520 align:start position:0%
communication across all entities
 
03:29:05.349 --> 03:29:05.359 align:start position:0%
serving children so it's best to meet
 
03:29:09.070 --> 03:29:09.080 align:start position:0%
their needs so expanding the office uh
 
03:29:11.630 --> 03:29:11.640 align:start position:0%
offices jurisdiction to cover all state
 
03:29:13.990 --> 03:29:14.000 align:start position:0%
Services provided to children it's fair
 
03:29:15.590 --> 03:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
it's thorough it's efficient and it's
 
03:29:18.710 --> 03:29:18.720 align:start position:0%
forward thinking because right now state
 
03:29:20.830 --> 03:29:20.840 align:start position:0%
and federal initiatives are shifting
 
03:29:24.229 --> 03:29:24.239 align:start position:0%
emphasis from responding to child abuse
 
03:29:27.550 --> 03:29:27.560 align:start position:0%
to preventing it so the heft of State
 
03:29:30.349 --> 03:29:30.359 align:start position:0%
Investments is right now moving upstream
 
03:29:32.189 --> 03:29:32.199 align:start position:0%
and it makes more sense to have this
 
03:29:34.670 --> 03:29:34.680 align:start position:0%
independent eye on the development and
 
03:29:37.030 --> 03:29:37.040 align:start position:0%
the implementation of programs intended
 
03:29:39.950 --> 03:29:39.960 align:start position:0%
to be responsive to Children's needs we
 
03:29:42.510 --> 03:29:42.520 align:start position:0%
know that few children start out in the
 
03:29:45.349 --> 03:29:45.359 align:start position:0%
care and supervision of dcyf and we need
 
03:29:47.349 --> 03:29:47.359 align:start position:0%
to be able to help before they get to
 
03:29:49.309 --> 03:29:49.319 align:start position:0%
that point and to Monitor and support
 
03:29:52.990 --> 03:29:53.000 align:start position:0%
dcyf when they do so through access to
 
03:29:54.950 --> 03:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
information the office of the child
 
03:29:56.630 --> 03:29:56.640 align:start position:0%
advocate is able to inform the
 
03:29:58.710 --> 03:29:58.720 align:start position:0%
development and implementation of policy
 
03:30:01.229 --> 03:30:01.239 align:start position:0%
and practice as it's experienced by
 
03:30:03.309 --> 03:30:03.319 align:start position:0%
children and families themselves it's
 
03:30:05.110 --> 03:30:05.120 align:start position:0%
been really valuable when we've had the
 
03:30:07.990 --> 03:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity to um provide information in
 
03:30:10.510 --> 03:30:10.520 align:start position:0%
that way this is a really powerful
 
03:30:12.510 --> 03:30:12.520 align:start position:0%
feedback loop for ensuring the best
 
03:30:15.070 --> 03:30:15.080 align:start position:0%
interests of children are served and
 
03:30:16.670 --> 03:30:16.680 align:start position:0%
we've also seen
 
03:30:20.110 --> 03:30:20.120 align:start position:0%
in the um covid-19 pandemic um that
 
03:30:22.550 --> 03:30:22.560 align:start position:0%
underscores the need for an expanded
 
03:30:24.710 --> 03:30:24.720 align:start position:0%
ability to help children because right
 
03:30:27.510 --> 03:30:27.520 align:start position:0%
now under the current statute we're able
 
03:30:29.710 --> 03:30:29.720 align:start position:0%
to assess the care of only 10 children
 
03:30:32.790 --> 03:30:32.800 align:start position:0%
in residential care who are covid-19 U
 
03:30:35.229 --> 03:30:35.239 align:start position:0%
positive infected um and in my written
 
03:30:37.349 --> 03:30:37.359 align:start position:0%
testimony I note that it's eight but
 
03:30:39.590 --> 03:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
it's actually 10 that we know of about
 
03:30:41.870 --> 03:30:41.880 align:start position:0%
at this point um we know that there are
 
03:30:44.429 --> 03:30:44.439 align:start position:0%
actually more children than 10 who have
 
03:30:46.830 --> 03:30:46.840 align:start position:0%
the covid-19 infection
 
03:30:48.030 --> 03:30:48.040 align:start position:0%
but because they were placed in
 
03:30:50.150 --> 03:30:50.160 align:start position:0%
residential programs by their schools we
 
03:30:51.990 --> 03:30:52.000 align:start position:0%
don't have access to their records and
 
03:30:54.910 --> 03:30:54.920 align:start position:0%
we can't help them or advocate for them
 
03:30:56.910 --> 03:30:56.920 align:start position:0%
similarily as as Ken Norton had
 
03:30:58.870 --> 03:30:58.880 align:start position:0%
suggested when a parent calls us
 
03:31:00.950 --> 03:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
desperate for mental health services
 
03:31:02.590 --> 03:31:02.600 align:start position:0%
we're going to do our best to provide
 
03:31:05.030 --> 03:31:05.040 align:start position:0%
information to them but we can't unless
 
03:31:07.070 --> 03:31:07.080 align:start position:0%
they're involved with dcyf we can't
 
03:31:09.550 --> 03:31:09.560 align:start position:0%
examine where's a child coming from
 
03:31:11.309 --> 03:31:11.319 align:start position:0%
what's been tried what's going on at
 
03:31:13.349 --> 03:31:13.359 align:start position:0%
schools what developmental services are
 
03:31:15.469 --> 03:31:15.479 align:start position:0%
they receiving in order to identify
 
03:31:19.229 --> 03:31:19.239 align:start position:0%
those gaps that will help um rectify the
 
03:31:20.870 --> 03:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
distress that both the parent and the
 
03:31:22.429 --> 03:31:22.439 align:start position:0%
child have reached at the point that
 
03:31:24.750 --> 03:31:24.760 align:start position:0%
they've contacted us so expanding
 
03:31:26.750 --> 03:31:26.760 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction would allow us to assist
 
03:31:29.830 --> 03:31:29.840 align:start position:0%
families before abuse before neglect
 
03:31:32.150 --> 03:31:32.160 align:start position:0%
before delinquency
 
03:31:35.189 --> 03:31:35.199 align:start position:0%
occurs then the independent issue that
 
03:31:37.630 --> 03:31:37.640 align:start position:0%
um that you were just hearing about from
 
03:31:37.640 --> 03:31:38.790 align:start position:0%
um that you were just hearing about from
Mr

03:31:38.790 --> 03:31:38.800 align:start position:0%
Mr
 
03:31:42.150 --> 03:31:42.160 align:start position:0%
buetti Senate Bill 295 clarifies the
 
03:31:44.870 --> 03:31:44.880 align:start position:0%
office is independent So currently the
 
03:31:44.880 --> 03:31:46.389 align:start position:0%
office is independent So currently the
statute

03:31:46.389 --> 03:31:46.399 align:start position:0%
statute
 
03:31:49.429 --> 03:31:49.439 align:start position:0%
reads that the office shall be an
 
03:31:52.910 --> 03:31:52.920 align:start position:0%
independent agency so Independence is
 
03:31:56.070 --> 03:31:56.080 align:start position:0%
just assumed it's essential to The
 
03:31:59.670 --> 03:31:59.680 align:start position:0%
credibility of the office in order to
 
03:32:03.550 --> 03:32:03.560 align:start position:0%
enjoy the trust with citizens it must be
 
03:32:05.950 --> 03:32:05.960 align:start position:0%
free from undue influence and conflict
 
03:32:08.510 --> 03:32:08.520 align:start position:0%
of interest or even the appearance of
 
03:32:12.349 --> 03:32:12.359 align:start position:0%
that this key ingredient to credibility
 
03:32:14.510 --> 03:32:14.520 align:start position:0%
has been questioned in several ways and
 
03:32:15.950 --> 03:32:15.960 align:start position:0%
you've just heard some of those question
 
03:32:18.269 --> 03:32:18.279 align:start position:0%
questions so first the independence of
 
03:32:20.229 --> 03:32:20.239 align:start position:0%
the office was it was called into
 
03:32:21.790 --> 03:32:21.800 align:start position:0%
question due to an appearance that it's
 
03:32:23.269 --> 03:32:23.279 align:start position:0%
part of the Department of Health and
 
03:32:25.469 --> 03:32:25.479 align:start position:0%
Human Services in other words we're part
 
03:32:28.030 --> 03:32:28.040 align:start position:0%
of the problem and that perception is
 
03:32:30.590 --> 03:32:30.600 align:start position:0%
remedied by moving the office to its own
 
03:32:33.389 --> 03:32:33.399 align:start position:0%
statute now the enabling statute was
 
03:32:35.950 --> 03:32:35.960 align:start position:0%
legislated in a budget Bill and because
 
03:32:38.349 --> 03:32:38.359 align:start position:0%
of that the language wasn't thorough so
 
03:32:40.910 --> 03:32:40.920 align:start position:0%
there are no definitions for example so
 
03:32:43.429 --> 03:32:43.439 align:start position:0%
the definitions clarify the role scope
 
03:32:46.349 --> 03:32:46.359 align:start position:0%
and authority of the office and Sen Bill
 
03:32:48.990 --> 03:32:49.000 align:start position:0%
295 includes a full list of responsive
 
03:32:51.750 --> 03:32:51.760 align:start position:0%
definitions including definitions of
 
03:32:54.030 --> 03:32:54.040 align:start position:0%
critical incidents and the critical
 
03:32:55.510 --> 03:32:55.520 align:start position:0%
incidents that the rep that the
 
03:32:58.349 --> 03:32:58.359 align:start position:0%
department is required already to report
 
03:33:02.469 --> 03:33:02.479 align:start position:0%
to us about actually includes by dcf's
 
03:33:05.510 --> 03:33:05.520 align:start position:0%
definitions media reports so they're not
 
03:33:08.189 --> 03:33:08.199 align:start position:0%
media reports about any child but it's a
 
03:33:10.389 --> 03:33:10.399 align:start position:0%
but they're media reports that DCF is
 
03:33:13.550 --> 03:33:13.560 align:start position:0%
looking at because a child is injured or
 
03:33:15.990 --> 03:33:16.000 align:start position:0%
there's a child Fatality and that's in
 
03:33:17.910 --> 03:33:17.920 align:start position:0%
the news and there's a concern about
 
03:33:20.070 --> 03:33:20.080 align:start position:0%
that in terms of child protection and
 
03:33:22.710 --> 03:33:22.720 align:start position:0%
child welfare because when a child is in
 
03:33:24.710 --> 03:33:24.720 align:start position:0%
the news there can be very negative
 
03:33:27.030 --> 03:33:27.040 align:start position:0%
repercussions on that child's life and
 
03:33:28.870 --> 03:33:28.880 align:start position:0%
experience and their siblings or any
 
03:33:31.030 --> 03:33:31.040 align:start position:0%
other children who are involved and that
 
03:33:35.110 --> 03:33:35.120 align:start position:0%
is explained in the section of the
 
03:33:37.150 --> 03:33:37.160 align:start position:0%
definitions um there's also been
 
03:33:39.070 --> 03:33:39.080 align:start position:0%
challenges to the office's Independence
 
03:33:40.950 --> 03:33:40.960 align:start position:0%
in relation to the Office of the
 
03:33:43.269 --> 03:33:43.279 align:start position:0%
Attorney General um and while we have
 
03:33:45.269 --> 03:33:45.279 align:start position:0%
confidence and have been informed that
 
03:33:47.070 --> 03:33:47.080 align:start position:0%
the attorney General takes every measure
 
03:33:49.349 --> 03:33:49.359 align:start position:0%
to separate representation of state
 
03:33:51.389 --> 03:33:51.399 align:start position:0%
agencies as Mr buffetti has just
 
03:33:55.110 --> 03:33:55.120 align:start position:0%
explained the perception of a conflict
 
03:33:57.670 --> 03:33:57.680 align:start position:0%
persists and representative Horn's
 
03:33:59.790 --> 03:33:59.800 align:start position:0%
Biblical reference to a man serving two
 
03:34:02.910 --> 03:34:02.920 align:start position:0%
masters is implicated here so despite
 
03:34:04.710 --> 03:34:04.720 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General's effort to
 
03:34:07.590 --> 03:34:07.600 align:start position:0%
separate interest the Attorney General
 
03:34:11.830 --> 03:34:11.840 align:start position:0%
is inherently embedded in DCF by its
 
03:34:15.189 --> 03:34:15.199 align:start position:0%
involvement in supervising training and
 
03:34:19.189 --> 03:34:19.199 align:start position:0%
supporting DCF attorneys conducting RSA
 
03:34:22.510 --> 03:34:22.520 align:start position:0%
126 U investigations of children in DCF
 
03:34:24.950 --> 03:34:24.960 align:start position:0%
custody when they are seriously injured
 
03:34:28.309 --> 03:34:28.319 align:start position:0%
or or killed during a restraint they
 
03:34:31.750 --> 03:34:31.760 align:start position:0%
participate in DCF special case reviews
 
03:34:34.030 --> 03:34:34.040 align:start position:0%
and they also participate in many DCF
 
03:34:36.750 --> 03:34:36.760 align:start position:0%
operational meetings it's very rare that
 
03:34:39.750 --> 03:34:39.760 align:start position:0%
we attend meetings with DCF that the
 
03:34:42.630 --> 03:34:42.640 align:start position:0%
Attorney General is not represented the
 
03:34:45.309 --> 03:34:45.319 align:start position:0%
remedy to the appearance or perception
 
03:34:48.189 --> 03:34:48.199 align:start position:0%
of compromised Independence borrows
 
03:34:50.710 --> 03:34:50.720 align:start position:0%
language from other States offices of
 
03:34:54.269 --> 03:34:54.279 align:start position:0%
the child Advocates so that line 25 in s
 
03:34:57.550 --> 03:34:57.560 align:start position:0%
SP 295 that proposes the language not
 
03:34:59.670 --> 03:34:59.680 align:start position:0%
withstanding any other provision of the
 
03:35:01.990 --> 03:35:02.000 align:start position:0%
law operate with full independence from
 
03:35:04.189 --> 03:35:04.199 align:start position:0%
any state official department or agency
 
03:35:06.550 --> 03:35:06.560 align:start position:0%
in the performance of its duties is
 
03:35:09.830 --> 03:35:09.840 align:start position:0%
language that is taken from other um
 
03:35:11.309 --> 03:35:11.319 align:start position:0%
other offices
 
03:35:13.469 --> 03:35:13.479 align:start position:0%
including Connecticut which has been in
 
03:35:16.229 --> 03:35:16.239 align:start position:0%
existence for over 25 years Rhode Island
 
03:35:18.189 --> 03:35:18.199 align:start position:0%
I think has been existence for about 35
 
03:35:20.349 --> 03:35:20.359 align:start position:0%
years Massachusetts as well and we give
 
03:35:22.590 --> 03:35:22.600 align:start position:0%
you the citations to those
 
03:35:26.590 --> 03:35:26.600 align:start position:0%
laws this language separates the office
 
03:35:28.590 --> 03:35:28.600 align:start position:0%
from any other agency including the
 
03:35:32.550 --> 03:35:32.560 align:start position:0%
Attorney General so long as its agents
 
03:35:35.910 --> 03:35:35.920 align:start position:0%
operate in compliance with the law so Mr
 
03:35:37.710 --> 03:35:37.720 align:start position:0%
bietti's concerns that the office would
 
03:35:40.550 --> 03:35:40.560 align:start position:0%
be exempt from provisions of law are in
 
03:35:43.950 --> 03:35:43.960 align:start position:0%
this way unfounded any deviation from
 
03:35:47.030 --> 03:35:47.040 align:start position:0%
lawful performance of duties would
 
03:35:49.389 --> 03:35:49.399 align:start position:0%
warrant usual oversight of the Attorney
 
03:35:51.510 --> 03:35:51.520 align:start position:0%
General the governor any member of
 
03:35:53.349 --> 03:35:53.359 align:start position:0%
executive Council or the oversight
 
03:35:55.790 --> 03:35:55.800 align:start position:0%
Commission on children's
 
03:35:58.150 --> 03:35:58.160 align:start position:0%
services so I've addressed some of the
 
03:36:01.429 --> 03:36:01.439 align:start position:0%
issues that that Mr Buffet's mentioned
 
03:36:05.110 --> 03:36:05.120 align:start position:0%
um I I want to point out criminal acts
 
03:36:06.950 --> 03:36:06.960 align:start position:0%
do not fall within the lawful
 
03:36:08.550 --> 03:36:08.560 align:start position:0%
performance of Duties in the office of
 
03:36:11.429 --> 03:36:11.439 align:start position:0%
the child advocate another concern of
 
03:36:14.110 --> 03:36:14.120 align:start position:0%
his expresses that um that the office
 
03:36:17.189 --> 03:36:17.199 align:start position:0%
would operate without any oversight in
 
03:36:19.910 --> 03:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
fact Senate Bill 295 recodified
 
03:36:21.590 --> 03:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
oversight Commission on children's
 
03:36:23.590 --> 03:36:23.600 align:start position:0%
services that's currently operating
 
03:36:25.630 --> 03:36:25.640 align:start position:0%
under RSA 170
 
03:36:29.110 --> 03:36:29.120 align:start position:0%
g19 it's a multi-disciplinary commission
 
03:36:31.389 --> 03:36:31.399 align:start position:0%
with representation from all branches of
 
03:36:33.510 --> 03:36:33.520 align:start position:0%
government the oversight commission
 
03:36:35.510 --> 03:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
provides oversight of the office of the
 
03:36:38.750 --> 03:36:38.760 align:start position:0%
child advocate furthermore the director
 
03:36:41.150 --> 03:36:41.160 align:start position:0%
is appointed by the governor for a Tim
 
03:36:43.790 --> 03:36:43.800 align:start position:0%
limited appointment the time limit is
 
03:36:46.870 --> 03:36:46.880 align:start position:0%
viewed as a protection against overreach
 
03:36:50.550 --> 03:36:50.560 align:start position:0%
But ultimately RSA chapter 41 empowers
 
03:36:52.670 --> 03:36:52.680 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General the governor any
 
03:36:54.870 --> 03:36:54.880 align:start position:0%
member of the executive Council or the
 
03:36:56.630 --> 03:36:56.640 align:start position:0%
appointing authority for That official
 
03:36:59.110 --> 03:36:59.120 align:start position:0%
to petition the governor and councel to
 
03:37:02.269 --> 03:37:02.279 align:start position:0%
remove the director for cause they these
 
03:37:04.750 --> 03:37:04.760 align:start position:0%
are very clear and effective mechanisms
 
03:37:07.070 --> 03:37:07.080 align:start position:0%
of oversight designed to endorse
 
03:37:09.429 --> 03:37:09.439 align:start position:0%
confidence in prevention of corruption
 
03:37:12.510 --> 03:37:12.520 align:start position:0%
or unlawful Behavior but also assuring
 
03:37:14.830 --> 03:37:14.840 align:start position:0%
the independence necessary for an
 
03:37:17.630 --> 03:37:17.640 align:start position:0%
effective voice voice on behalf of
 
03:37:20.510 --> 03:37:20.520 align:start position:0%
children as the first director of The
 
03:37:22.349 --> 03:37:22.359 align:start position:0%
Office of the child advocate I really
 
03:37:24.710 --> 03:37:24.720 align:start position:0%
feel the weight of ensuring the office
 
03:37:27.229 --> 03:37:27.239 align:start position:0%
is well grounded and able to function as
 
03:37:29.670 --> 03:37:29.680 align:start position:0%
the legislature envisioned for the long
 
03:37:33.429 --> 03:37:33.439 align:start position:0%
run as an independent agency Senate two
 
03:37:36.590 --> 03:37:36.600 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 295 refines and positions
 
03:37:39.550 --> 03:37:39.560 align:start position:0%
the office for Independence for
 
03:37:42.990 --> 03:37:43.000 align:start position:0%
impartiality for credibility and for
 
03:37:44.910 --> 03:37:44.920 align:start position:0%
privilege to access that necessary
 
03:37:47.110 --> 03:37:47.120 align:start position:0%
information to make a difference in how
 
03:37:49.309 --> 03:37:49.319 align:start position:0%
effectively children are served by the
 
03:37:51.790 --> 03:37:51.800 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire there are other
 
03:37:54.189 --> 03:37:54.199 align:start position:0%
small adjustments in the current statute
 
03:37:55.830 --> 03:37:55.840 align:start position:0%
um I want to especially call your
 
03:37:57.469 --> 03:37:57.479 align:start position:0%
attention to the Senate amendment that
 
03:38:00.710 --> 03:38:00.720 align:start position:0%
removed the fiscal note on this bill um
 
03:38:02.830 --> 03:38:02.840 align:start position:0%
and then just a couple of quick comments
 
03:38:05.429 --> 03:38:05.439 align:start position:0%
on um on a couple of other things that
 
03:38:08.429 --> 03:38:08.439 align:start position:0%
came up in Mr Buffet's testimony um his
 
03:38:10.429 --> 03:38:10.439 align:start position:0%
reference to the office of the child
 
03:38:11.950 --> 03:38:11.960 align:start position:0%
advocate having the authority to
 
03:38:15.110 --> 03:38:15.120 align:start position:0%
investigate any agency it's the office
 
03:38:17.630 --> 03:38:17.640 align:start position:0%
of the child advocate and in the
 
03:38:20.670 --> 03:38:20.680 align:start position:0%
definitions and in the main statute um
 
03:38:22.870 --> 03:38:22.880 align:start position:0%
this is referring to any agency that
 
03:38:25.950 --> 03:38:25.960 align:start position:0%
serves children and it wouldn't be in
 
03:38:27.950 --> 03:38:27.960 align:start position:0%
the normal performance of duties for
 
03:38:30.349 --> 03:38:30.359 align:start position:0%
example that the child advocate would
 
03:38:34.349 --> 03:38:34.359 align:start position:0%
investigate um uh some state agency that
 
03:38:36.469 --> 03:38:36.479 align:start position:0%
doesn't serve children at all that
 
03:38:37.870 --> 03:38:37.880 align:start position:0%
wouldn't make any sense so it is
 
03:38:41.469 --> 03:38:41.479 align:start position:0%
definitely limited to um to the agencies
 
03:38:43.830 --> 03:38:43.840 align:start position:0%
that are serving children and generally
 
03:38:46.750 --> 03:38:46.760 align:start position:0%
what prompts this Authority is when
 
03:38:49.070 --> 03:38:49.080 align:start position:0%
there are complaints received or the
 
03:38:51.070 --> 03:38:51.080 align:start position:0%

03:38:53.590 --> 03:38:53.600 align:start position:0%
are not served properly I've already
 
03:38:56.189 --> 03:38:56.199 align:start position:0%

03:39:16.830 --> 03:39:16.840 align:start position:0%
Dr O'Neal thank you for taking my
 
03:39:20.670 --> 03:39:20.680 align:start position:0%
question um I understood you to say that
 
03:39:24.389 --> 03:39:24.399 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note has been removed by the
 
03:39:26.990 --> 03:39:27.000 align:start position:0%
Senate yes thank you for that question
 
03:39:29.150 --> 03:39:29.160 align:start position:0%
the the fiscal the fiscal note attach
 
03:39:31.750 --> 03:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
was um was the need for additional
 
03:39:35.590 --> 03:39:35.600 align:start position:0%
positions and in the last session um the
 
03:39:37.550 --> 03:39:37.560 align:start position:0%
the both the Senate and the house uh
 
03:39:39.469 --> 03:39:39.479 align:start position:0%
made accommodations for two new
 
03:39:42.389 --> 03:39:42.399 align:start position:0%
positions in the office so um so we are
 
03:39:44.910 --> 03:39:44.920 align:start position:0%
we are fully staffed or or we are we are
 
03:39:46.950 --> 03:39:46.960 align:start position:0%
situated to be fully staffed so it's not
 
03:39:49.389 --> 03:39:49.399 align:start position:0%
necessary and it was removed um when it
 
03:39:51.389 --> 03:39:51.399 align:start position:0%
was inste at
 
03:39:53.189 --> 03:39:53.199 align:start position:0%
Judiciary thank
 
03:39:56.510 --> 03:39:56.520 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
03:39:59.389 --> 03:39:59.399 align:start position:0%
horn thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
03:40:02.070 --> 03:40:02.080 align:start position:0%
for coming to give your testimony it's
 
03:40:05.590 --> 03:40:05.600 align:start position:0%
always enjoyable to listen to the source
 
03:40:05.600 --> 03:40:06.510 align:start position:0%
always enjoyable to listen to the source
of

03:40:06.510 --> 03:40:06.520 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:40:09.710 --> 03:40:09.720 align:start position:0%
expertise um my question concerns the
 
03:40:12.150 --> 03:40:12.160 align:start position:0%
oversight committee establishing by my
 
03:40:14.790 --> 03:40:14.800 align:start position:0%
count 18 separate people who would be
 
03:40:17.510 --> 03:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
appointed by various authorities to
 
03:40:19.990 --> 03:40:20.000 align:start position:0%
impanel this oversight commission um do
 
03:40:23.630 --> 03:40:23.640 align:start position:0%
you have any concerns about a 18 people
 
03:40:28.790 --> 03:40:28.800 align:start position:0%
or be the Quorum requirement to be nine
 
03:40:31.309 --> 03:40:31.319 align:start position:0%
people um thank you for that question I
 
03:40:33.269 --> 03:40:33.279 align:start position:0%
hadn't really given thought to uh
 
03:40:35.229 --> 03:40:35.239 align:start position:0%
concerns about Quorum because generally
 
03:40:37.110 --> 03:40:37.120 align:start position:0%
the oversight commission meetings are
 
03:40:40.710 --> 03:40:40.720 align:start position:0%
well attended um and it is actually um
 
03:40:43.429 --> 03:40:43.439 align:start position:0%
enlarged in Senate Bill 295 because it's
 
03:40:45.790 --> 03:40:45.800 align:start position:0%
made room for two new positions one
 
03:40:48.550 --> 03:40:48.560 align:start position:0%
being a foster parent and one being
 
03:40:50.790 --> 03:40:50.800 align:start position:0%
someone who has in their past received
 
03:40:53.910 --> 03:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
Services as a child from DCF we agreed
 
03:40:55.349 --> 03:40:55.359 align:start position:0%
with Senator Carson that that was
 
03:40:57.670 --> 03:40:57.680 align:start position:0%
important that people who are consumers
 
03:41:01.269 --> 03:41:01.279 align:start position:0%
of um dcyf services and and state
 
03:41:03.990 --> 03:41:04.000 align:start position:0%
services in general um could really give
 
03:41:06.670 --> 03:41:06.680 align:start position:0%
us good guidance um from the oversight
 
03:41:09.790 --> 03:41:09.800 align:start position:0%
commission um so um I I don't I think
 
03:41:12.229 --> 03:41:12.239 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire generally tends to
 
03:41:15.309 --> 03:41:15.319 align:start position:0%
have very large committees anyhow um it
 
03:41:17.429 --> 03:41:17.439 align:start position:0%
includes a lot of folks and so we're
 
03:41:20.110 --> 03:41:20.120 align:start position:0%
sort of used to that I don't think 18 is
 
03:41:22.429 --> 03:41:22.439 align:start position:0%
ungainly um and we always really
 
03:41:24.710 --> 03:41:24.720 align:start position:0%
appreciate very very substantive
 
03:41:26.750 --> 03:41:26.760 align:start position:0%
feedback from the the oversight
 
03:41:29.349 --> 03:41:29.359 align:start position:0%
Commission on the work that we do I I
 
03:41:31.550 --> 03:41:31.560 align:start position:0%
regret that it's a public committee and
 
03:41:33.950 --> 03:41:33.960 align:start position:0%
it's not or commission and it's not
 
03:41:36.349 --> 03:41:36.359 align:start position:0%
something that acts more as an advisory
 
03:41:38.149 --> 03:41:38.159 align:start position:0%
panel because I think we could benefit
 
03:41:40.110 --> 03:41:40.120 align:start position:0%
from that a little bit more and having
 
03:41:42.389 --> 03:41:42.399 align:start position:0%
private conversations um but we have
 
03:41:43.830 --> 03:41:43.840 align:start position:0%
found the oversight commission to be
 
03:41:45.830 --> 03:41:45.840 align:start position:0%
really useful and we we' had good
 
03:41:49.950 --> 03:41:49.960 align:start position:0%
feedback about um our ability to take um
 
03:41:51.790 --> 03:41:51.800 align:start position:0%
guidance and instruction from them as
 
03:41:53.630 --> 03:41:53.640 align:start position:0%
well thank
 
03:41:57.710 --> 03:41:57.720 align:start position:0%
you very good seeing uh no more no more
 
03:42:01.870 --> 03:42:01.880 align:start position:0%
questions uh thank you Dr O'Neal thank
 
03:42:05.389 --> 03:42:05.399 align:start position:0%
you uh I have two more people to speak
 
03:42:08.229 --> 03:42:08.239 align:start position:0%
I'll call uh next up
 
03:42:13.389 --> 03:42:13.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:16.229 --> 03:42:16.239 align:start position:0%
dejoy just a moment okay up
 
03:42:19.990 --> 03:42:20.000 align:start position:0%
here oh there you are there we go Mr Joy
 
03:42:22.910 --> 03:42:22.920 align:start position:0%
and I assume people can hear me yes
 
03:42:24.429 --> 03:42:24.439 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and and members of
 
03:42:25.990 --> 03:42:26.000 align:start position:0%
the committee I I'm going to do my best
 
03:42:28.229 --> 03:42:28.239 align:start position:0%
to be brief I appreciate your
 
03:42:30.349 --> 03:42:30.359 align:start position:0%
perseverance through this afternoon I
 
03:42:32.550 --> 03:42:32.560 align:start position:0%
can see a lot of tired faces and I don't
 
03:42:35.349 --> 03:42:35.359 align:start position:0%
want to do anything to add to that um
 
03:42:37.149 --> 03:42:37.159 align:start position:0%
you have my testimony I will I will try
 
03:42:39.469 --> 03:42:39.479 align:start position:0%
to excerpt it as I go through it and I
 
03:42:41.389 --> 03:42:41.399 align:start position:0%
always hate when I have to follow Dr
 
03:42:43.030 --> 03:42:43.040 align:start position:0%
O'Neal with her testimony because she
 
03:42:45.429 --> 03:42:45.439 align:start position:0%
ends up stealing most of my testimony
 
03:42:47.510 --> 03:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
and yet again today she has taken most
 
03:42:49.229 --> 03:42:49.239 align:start position:0%
of my testimony and I'll try to skip
 
03:42:52.229 --> 03:42:52.239 align:start position:0%
those parts just one clarification in
 
03:42:54.790 --> 03:42:54.800 align:start position:0%
terms of the fiscal note the fiscal note
 
03:42:56.429 --> 03:42:56.439 align:start position:0%
uh the Senate cannot remove the fiscal
 
03:42:59.030 --> 03:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
note there is still a fiscal note but it
 
03:43:00.990 --> 03:43:01.000 align:start position:0%
has no application now as she pointed
 
03:43:03.189 --> 03:43:03.199 align:start position:0%
out it was request for two positions
 
03:43:05.469 --> 03:43:05.479 align:start position:0%
that were approved through the budget
 
03:43:08.630 --> 03:43:08.640 align:start position:0%
and so there is no reference to any need
 
03:43:11.070 --> 03:43:11.080 align:start position:0%
for financing in the bill and we expect
 
03:43:14.229 --> 03:43:14.239 align:start position:0%
Finance would uh decline to take this
 
03:43:16.550 --> 03:43:16.560 align:start position:0%
bill uh to the the
 
03:43:16.560 --> 03:43:19.349 align:start position:0%
bill uh to the the
committee

03:43:19.349 --> 03:43:19.359 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:43:22.309 --> 03:43:22.319 align:start position:0%
um the the second point I would make is
 
03:43:24.950 --> 03:43:24.960 align:start position:0%
that this originally was a standalone
 
03:43:28.469 --> 03:43:28.479 align:start position:0%
Bill several years ago and was on this
 
03:43:30.990 --> 03:43:31.000 align:start position:0%
committee heard the bill and it was only
 
03:43:32.910 --> 03:43:32.920 align:start position:0%
uh combined with the budget after the
 
03:43:34.590 --> 03:43:34.600 align:start position:0%
policy committee had acted on the policy
 
03:43:38.030 --> 03:43:38.040 align:start position:0%
and forwarded it so the reason it may
 
03:43:40.429 --> 03:43:40.439 align:start position:0%
not be as robust in the the current
 
03:43:42.950 --> 03:43:42.960 align:start position:0%
language has more to do with my
 
03:43:45.149 --> 03:43:45.159 align:start position:0%
shortcomings than it does with the
 
03:43:47.349 --> 03:43:47.359 align:start position:0%
shortcomings of the legislative process
 
03:43:49.630 --> 03:43:49.640 align:start position:0%
um so most of you are aware of this most
 
03:43:50.990 --> 03:43:51.000 align:start position:0%
of you have been dealing with this for a
 
03:43:52.550 --> 03:43:52.560 align:start position:0%
number of years and are aware this
 
03:43:54.710 --> 03:43:54.720 align:start position:0%
committee approved the bill three years
 
03:43:56.950 --> 03:43:56.960 align:start position:0%
ago thus creating the office of the
 
03:43:56.960 --> 03:43:58.349 align:start position:0%
ago thus creating the office of the
child

03:43:58.349 --> 03:43:58.359 align:start position:0%
child
 
03:44:00.670 --> 03:44:00.680 align:start position:0%
advocate when I brought this language to
 
03:44:03.269 --> 03:44:03.279 align:start position:0%
you three years ago I made a statement
 
03:44:06.910 --> 03:44:06.920 align:start position:0%
such to the effect that we um were
 
03:44:09.070 --> 03:44:09.080 align:start position:0%
providing a very limited scope of
 
03:44:10.990 --> 03:44:11.000 align:start position:0%
oversight so as not to overwhelm the
 
03:44:14.229 --> 03:44:14.239 align:start position:0%
office but we fully expected we would be
 
03:44:17.469 --> 03:44:17.479 align:start position:0%
back asking for expanded oversight as it
 
03:44:19.990 --> 03:44:20.000 align:start position:0%
was warranted and that's really what
 
03:44:23.189 --> 03:44:23.199 align:start position:0%
this bill does today before you in in
 
03:44:26.030 --> 03:44:26.040 align:start position:0%
the main it expands the scope of the
 
03:44:30.149 --> 03:44:30.159 align:start position:0%
office uh Beyond uh dcyf which is
 
03:44:32.670 --> 03:44:32.680 align:start position:0%
primarily where the scope has been uh
 
03:44:36.830 --> 03:44:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:40.830 --> 03:44:40.840 align:start position:0%
years the expanded scope will include as
 
03:44:43.790 --> 03:44:43.800 align:start position:0%
uh Dr O'Neal said child child services
 
03:44:45.389 --> 03:44:45.399 align:start position:0%
uh child serving agencies but will also
 
03:44:48.030 --> 03:44:48.040 align:start position:0%
include contracted Services uh and most
 
03:44:50.710 --> 03:44:50.720 align:start position:0%
particularly will include doe uh there
 
03:44:53.269 --> 03:44:53.279 align:start position:0%
are a number of schools that provide
 
03:44:55.830 --> 03:44:55.840 align:start position:0%
services and schools are far beyond the
 
03:45:00.269 --> 03:45:00.279 align:start position:0%
oversight um of the office and in fact
 
03:45:02.510 --> 03:45:02.520 align:start position:0%
what we should permit the and expect the
 
03:45:04.309 --> 03:45:04.319 align:start position:0%
office to do is follow the data where it
 
03:45:07.149 --> 03:45:07.159 align:start position:0%
leads not be stopped at a border of an
 
03:45:09.469 --> 03:45:09.479 align:start position:0%
agency when data suggests that there may
 
03:45:11.550 --> 03:45:11.560 align:start position:0%
be some reason to to take a look at that
 
03:45:13.830 --> 03:45:13.840 align:start position:0%
agency we should allow the data to to
 
03:45:16.710 --> 03:45:16.720 align:start position:0%
speak to the office and and follow the
 
03:45:20.990 --> 03:45:21.000 align:start position:0%
data where it uh uh where it
 
03:45:24.550 --> 03:45:24.560 align:start position:0%
leads so just very briefly some history
 
03:45:26.349 --> 03:45:26.359 align:start position:0%
for folks who were not on the committee
 
03:45:28.670 --> 03:45:28.680 align:start position:0%
three years ago who were not involved in
 
03:45:33.510 --> 03:45:33.520 align:start position:0%
in this legislation several years ago um
 
03:45:36.349 --> 03:45:36.359 align:start position:0%
this office really had its Beginnings
 
03:45:39.870 --> 03:45:39.880 align:start position:0%
after the Great Recession back in 2009
 
03:45:43.910 --> 03:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
2010 at that point we had significant
 
03:45:45.590 --> 03:45:45.600 align:start position:0%
budget short
 
03:45:48.510 --> 03:45:48.520 align:start position:0%
Falls budget cuts were made across the
 
03:45:52.149 --> 03:45:52.159 align:start position:0%
board and few of any agencies were uh
 
03:45:56.229 --> 03:45:56.239 align:start position:0%
were unaffected by those budget cuts DCF
 
03:45:58.469 --> 03:45:58.479 align:start position:0%
was particularly affected by those
 
03:45:58.479 --> 03:45:59.510 align:start position:0%
was particularly affected by those
budget

03:45:59.510 --> 03:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
budget
 
03:46:02.790 --> 03:46:02.800 align:start position:0%
cuts and during the ensuing years were
 
03:46:06.389 --> 03:46:06.399 align:start position:0%
some of the most difficult days for DCF
 
03:46:09.510 --> 03:46:09.520 align:start position:0%
it's when we saw the case loads explode
 
03:46:11.309 --> 03:46:11.319 align:start position:0%
it's when we saw a lack of workers it's
 
03:46:13.110 --> 03:46:13.120 align:start position:0%
when we saw a lack of services it's when
 
03:46:15.149 --> 03:46:15.159 align:start position:0%
we saw the department
 
03:46:18.229 --> 03:46:18.239 align:start position:0%
um de facto changed the definition of
 
03:46:20.349 --> 03:46:20.359 align:start position:0%
abuse and neglect which has now been
 
03:46:23.950 --> 03:46:23.960 align:start position:0%
codified so that fewer um fewer children
 
03:46:26.429 --> 03:46:26.439 align:start position:0%
were able to access the services uh that
 
03:46:28.910 --> 03:46:28.920 align:start position:0%
were available leaving more families uh
 
03:46:30.229 --> 03:46:30.239 align:start position:0%
to fend for
 
03:46:32.750 --> 03:46:32.760 align:start position:0%
themselves it was in fact the deaths of
 
03:46:36.670 --> 03:46:36.680 align:start position:0%
multiple children in the in the 2014
 
03:46:40.349 --> 03:46:40.359 align:start position:0%
2015 era that prompted the the
 
03:46:42.750 --> 03:46:42.760 align:start position:0%
commissions that ultimately recommended
 
03:46:45.030 --> 03:46:45.040 align:start position:0%
creating this office
 
03:46:47.750 --> 03:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
I bring that up uh not simply to talk
 
03:46:51.030 --> 03:46:51.040 align:start position:0%
about history but to tie it to today
 
03:46:54.110 --> 03:46:54.120 align:start position:0%
today with the covid crisis we are also
 
03:46:56.790 --> 03:46:56.800 align:start position:0%
seeing currently about $135 million
 
03:47:00.469 --> 03:47:00.479 align:start position:0%
shortfall in state budget revenues we we
 
03:47:02.710 --> 03:47:02.720 align:start position:0%
are already assured that the next budget
 
03:47:05.670 --> 03:47:05.680 align:start position:0%
cycle will be quite difficult and there
 
03:47:08.510 --> 03:47:08.520 align:start position:0%
will be cuts across the board again next
 
03:47:11.550 --> 03:47:11.560 align:start position:0%
year we have just dug out of the hole
 
03:47:13.269 --> 03:47:13.279 align:start position:0%
that we created for ourselves a number
 
03:47:16.469 --> 03:47:16.479 align:start position:0%
of years ago and in order to protect
 
03:47:19.750 --> 03:47:19.760 align:start position:0%
children this office is a very important
 
03:47:22.070 --> 03:47:22.080 align:start position:0%
part of that and will be an essential
 
03:47:23.630 --> 03:47:23.640 align:start position:0%
part of that as we move forward through
 
03:47:28.389 --> 03:47:28.399 align:start position:0%
the next budget I apologize for my cat
 
03:47:31.910 --> 03:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
um this office will be essential to to
 
03:47:34.510 --> 03:47:34.520 align:start position:0%
stay above political considerations and
 
03:47:35.870 --> 03:47:35.880 align:start position:0%
only look at what is in the best
 
03:47:37.910 --> 03:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
interest of children and I think and for
 
03:47:40.750 --> 03:47:40.760 align:start position:0%
that reason um among the others you've
 
03:47:43.990 --> 03:47:44.000 align:start position:0%
heard is a reason to make sure this
 
03:47:45.469 --> 03:47:45.479 align:start position:0%
office exists
 
03:47:49.189 --> 03:47:49.199 align:start position:0%
but exists in full Independence uh there
 
03:47:53.189 --> 03:47:53.199 align:start position:0%
is robust oversight as you heard and um
 
03:47:54.910 --> 03:47:54.920 align:start position:0%
Dr O'Neal I know has provided you with a
 
03:47:59.189 --> 03:47:59.199 align:start position:0%
list of the the um the oca's
 
03:48:00.710 --> 03:48:00.720 align:start position:0%
Publications for the past couple of
 
03:48:02.309 --> 03:48:02.319 align:start position:0%
years I would encourage you to take a
 
03:48:04.590 --> 03:48:04.600 align:start position:0%
look at it it is a substantial list
 
03:48:06.870 --> 03:48:06.880 align:start position:0%
showing the work they have done um and
 
03:48:08.510 --> 03:48:08.520 align:start position:0%
there is far more work that that they
 
03:48:10.030 --> 03:48:10.040 align:start position:0%
will be able to do over the next several
 
03:48:11.950 --> 03:48:11.960 align:start position:0%
years um with that I would simply ask
 
03:48:15.389 --> 03:48:15.399 align:start position:0%
you to support the bill um and to expand
 
03:48:18.870 --> 03:48:18.880 align:start position:0%
the scope of the office thank you thank
 
03:48:21.550 --> 03:48:21.560 align:start position:0%

okay um bear with me for one moment I'm

sir you can oh good thank you so much my
 
03:49:43.710 --> 03:49:43.720 align:start position:0%
apologies for um the tech issues um my
 
03:49:45.670 --> 03:49:45.680 align:start position:0%
name is y b I'm the legal director for
 
03:49:48.309 --> 03:49:48.319 align:start position:0%
the ACLU of New Hampshire thank you so
 
03:49:50.269 --> 03:49:50.279 align:start position:0%
much for the opportunity to testify I'll
 
03:49:52.750 --> 03:49:52.760 align:start position:0%
try to keep this as brief as possible
 
03:49:55.590 --> 03:49:55.600 align:start position:0%
recognizing that we are close towards
 
03:49:58.070 --> 03:49:58.080 align:start position:0%
the end of the the the day um this is a
 
03:50:00.750 --> 03:50:00.760 align:start position:0%
bill uh that the ACLU supports read
 
03:50:02.830 --> 03:50:02.840 align:start position:0%
recommend that this bill be voted out of
 
03:50:05.349 --> 03:50:05.359 align:start position:0%
committee ought to pass uh because we
 
03:50:08.750 --> 03:50:08.760 align:start position:0%
think it's critical for uh the office of
 
03:50:10.670 --> 03:50:10.680 align:start position:0%
the child advocate to be independent in
 
03:50:13.030 --> 03:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
order to ensure that it can adequately
 
03:50:15.510 --> 03:50:15.520 align:start position:0%
protect children and perform
 
03:50:18.269 --> 03:50:18.279 align:start position:0%
its government accountability function
 
03:50:21.590 --> 03:50:21.600 align:start position:0%
without undue pressure um I am aware I'm
 
03:50:24.710 --> 03:50:24.720 align:start position:0%
going to really limit my testimony to
 
03:50:27.030 --> 03:50:27.040 align:start position:0%
the legal constitutional and separation
 
03:50:29.950 --> 03:50:29.960 align:start position:0%
of powers issues raised by the Attorney
 
03:50:32.510 --> 03:50:32.520 align:start position:0%
General's office um I am aware that the
 
03:50:34.229 --> 03:50:34.239 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice did submit a
 
03:50:37.189 --> 03:50:37.199 align:start position:0%
letter with their concerns we yesterday
 
03:50:39.950 --> 03:50:39.960 align:start position:0%
submitted a letter addressing the
 
03:50:41.790 --> 03:50:41.800 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's concerns and our
 
03:50:43.870 --> 03:50:43.880 align:start position:0%
belief that those concerns are unfounded
 
03:50:45.590 --> 03:50:45.600 align:start position:0%
I do hope that the committee received
 
03:50:47.670 --> 03:50:47.680 align:start position:0%
that letter if it did not I'd be happy
 
03:50:50.910 --> 03:50:50.920 align:start position:0%
to circulate it individually uh to to
 
03:50:53.590 --> 03:50:53.600 align:start position:0%
all the members um but I would just say
 
03:50:55.110 --> 03:50:55.120 align:start position:0%
really at I really want to make three
 
03:50:58.110 --> 03:50:58.120 align:start position:0%
points and and number one is just how
 
03:51:00.710 --> 03:51:00.720 align:start position:0%
Independence is really essential and
 
03:51:04.590 --> 03:51:04.600 align:start position:0%
necessary in this case um and it's
 
03:51:08.269 --> 03:51:08.279 align:start position:0%
essential and necessary because the work
 
03:51:11.149 --> 03:51:11.159 align:start position:0%
of the office of the child advocate is
 
03:51:14.590 --> 03:51:14.600 align:start position:0%
inherently going to be intention in
 
03:51:18.990 --> 03:51:19.000 align:start position:0%
ention and adverse to DCF and
 
03:51:22.269 --> 03:51:22.279 align:start position:0%
potentially other state agencies and so
 
03:51:23.830 --> 03:51:23.840 align:start position:0%
now you have a situation where you have
 
03:51:26.229 --> 03:51:26.239 align:start position:0%
two agencies that have conflicting
 
03:51:26.239 --> 03:51:27.510 align:start position:0%
two agencies that have conflicting
interests

03:51:27.510 --> 03:51:27.520 align:start position:0%
interests
 
03:51:30.750 --> 03:51:30.760 align:start position:0%
potentially um and Independence is
 
03:51:30.760 --> 03:51:31.990 align:start position:0%
potentially um and Independence is
essential

03:51:31.990 --> 03:51:32.000 align:start position:0%
essential
 
03:51:34.269 --> 03:51:34.279 align:start position:0%
because if you have the Department of
 
03:51:36.309 --> 03:51:36.319 align:start position:0%
Justice say
 
03:51:38.830 --> 03:51:38.840 align:start position:0%
representing uh or managing both
 
03:51:41.469 --> 03:51:41.479 align:start position:0%
entities there is a potential conflict
 
03:51:43.469 --> 03:51:43.479 align:start position:0%
one could imagine that conflict
 
03:51:46.389 --> 03:51:46.399 align:start position:0%
obviously occurring if the OCA wants to
 
03:51:49.590 --> 03:51:49.600 align:start position:0%
issue a subpoena understandably so to
 
03:51:53.229 --> 03:51:53.239 align:start position:0%
DCF for documents and so that is why I
 
03:51:55.670 --> 03:51:55.680 align:start position:0%
think it is so critical that the OCA
 
03:51:59.189 --> 03:51:59.199 align:start position:0%
exist uh independently to really avoid
 
03:52:01.189 --> 03:52:01.199 align:start position:0%
even the appearance of those types of
 
03:52:03.750 --> 03:52:03.760 align:start position:0%
conflicts and to give the OCA the
 
03:52:08.269 --> 03:52:08.279 align:start position:0%
independence and and uh free reign
 
03:52:11.630 --> 03:52:11.640 align:start position:0%
without undue pressure it needs to to do
 
03:52:15.830 --> 03:52:15.840 align:start position:0%
um its work um on point two on the
 
03:52:18.950 --> 03:52:18.960 align:start position:0%
Constitutional issues um there is no
 
03:52:21.309 --> 03:52:21.319 align:start position:0%
separation of powers problem with this
 
03:52:24.790 --> 03:52:24.800 align:start position:0%
bill this bill does not um as the
 
03:52:26.670 --> 03:52:26.680 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice say create an
 
03:52:28.389 --> 03:52:28.399 align:start position:0%
unaccountable fourth branch of
 
03:52:31.710 --> 03:52:31.720 align:start position:0%
government it does not do that and it
 
03:52:35.189 --> 03:52:35.199 align:start position:0%
doesn't do that for several
 
03:52:37.590 --> 03:52:37.600 align:start position:0%
reasons um and let me just say at the
 
03:52:39.630 --> 03:52:39.640 align:start position:0%
outset I think the first reason is
 
03:52:42.110 --> 03:52:42.120 align:start position:0%
because the office exists within the
 
03:52:43.630 --> 03:52:43.640 align:start position:0%
executive branch we still have three
 
03:52:45.550 --> 03:52:45.560 align:start position:0%
branches of government in New Hampshire
 
03:52:47.670 --> 03:52:47.680 align:start position:0%
like the federal system the Judiciary
 
03:52:50.229 --> 03:52:50.239 align:start position:0%
the executive branch um and the
 
03:52:54.189 --> 03:52:54.199 align:start position:0%
legislature the OCA in this bill still
 
03:52:56.229 --> 03:52:56.239 align:start position:0%
exists within the executive branch one
 
03:52:58.710 --> 03:52:58.720 align:start position:0%
of the three branches of government um
 
03:53:00.349 --> 03:53:00.359 align:start position:0%
here within I think it's the office of
 
03:53:00.359 --> 03:53:01.710 align:start position:0%
here within I think it's the office of
administrative

03:53:01.710 --> 03:53:01.720 align:start position:0%
administrative
 
03:53:03.630 --> 03:53:03.640 align:start position:0%
services that is something that it is
 
03:53:05.309 --> 03:53:05.319 align:start position:0%
perfectly appropriate for the
 
03:53:09.550 --> 03:53:09.560 align:start position:0%
legislature to do uh but there is also
 
03:53:12.670 --> 03:53:12.680 align:start position:0%
uh no separation of powers concerns here
 
03:53:15.469 --> 03:53:15.479 align:start position:0%
because the OCA can and still be
 
03:53:17.830 --> 03:53:17.840 align:start position:0%
effectively controlled or there is some
 
03:53:21.070 --> 03:53:21.080 align:start position:0%
monum of control uh that the executive
 
03:53:23.990 --> 03:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
branch here the governor has on the OCA
 
03:53:25.790 --> 03:53:25.800 align:start position:0%
and I know that the the director talked
 
03:53:27.189 --> 03:53:27.199 align:start position:0%
about some of these but I think it's
 
03:53:30.269 --> 03:53:30.279 align:start position:0%
worth rearticulating the director can be
 
03:53:32.630 --> 03:53:32.640 align:start position:0%
terminated um by the executive branch
 
03:53:34.389 --> 03:53:34.399 align:start position:0%
for Mal feasance misfeasance
 
03:53:36.830 --> 03:53:36.840 align:start position:0%
inefficiency in office etc those
 
03:53:39.309 --> 03:53:39.319 align:start position:0%
Provisions are in rsa4 colon one which
 
03:53:42.750 --> 03:53:42.760 align:start position:0%
are bootstrapped into this bill in
 
03:53:44.429 --> 03:53:44.439 align:start position:0%
addition the Attorney General the
 
03:53:46.229 --> 03:53:46.239 align:start position:0%
Governor or any member of the executive
 
03:53:48.510 --> 03:53:48.520 align:start position:0%
Council can petition the governor in
 
03:53:50.990 --> 03:53:51.000 align:start position:0%
Council for removal so the Attorney
 
03:53:53.590 --> 03:53:53.600 align:start position:0%
General even if this bill were to
 
03:53:57.030 --> 03:53:57.040 align:start position:0%
enacted uh to be enacted could actually
 
03:53:59.830 --> 03:53:59.840 align:start position:0%
attempt to remove the director that is
 
03:54:03.790 --> 03:54:03.800 align:start position:0%
um uh I think actually appropriate check
 
03:54:06.429 --> 03:54:06.439 align:start position:0%
on the director's power um and I think
 
03:54:08.590 --> 03:54:08.600 align:start position:0%
really blunts the department of
 
03:54:10.950 --> 03:54:10.960 align:start position:0%
Justice's argument that that you know
 
03:54:12.590 --> 03:54:12.600 align:start position:0%
this office really is just a fourth
 
03:54:14.910 --> 03:54:14.920 align:start position:0%
branch unaccountable agency which it
 
03:54:17.229 --> 03:54:17.239 align:start position:0%
clearly is not and then of course under
 
03:54:20.149 --> 03:54:20.159 align:start position:0%
RSA 4.1 the director can ultimately then
 
03:54:22.910 --> 03:54:22.920 align:start position:0%
be removed upon a vote by the governor
 
03:54:24.389 --> 03:54:24.399 align:start position:0%
and executive
 
03:54:27.349 --> 03:54:27.359 align:start position:0%
counsel in the federal context a lot of
 
03:54:30.229 --> 03:54:30.239 align:start position:0%
these issues were actually
 
03:54:33.309 --> 03:54:33.319 align:start position:0%
litigated um uh when there was a
 
03:54:36.790 --> 03:54:36.800 align:start position:0%
challenge to the uh independent Council
 
03:54:38.790 --> 03:54:38.800 align:start position:0%
statute uh this was a constitutional
 
03:54:40.910 --> 03:54:40.920 align:start position:0%
challenge that went to the US Supreme
 
03:54:43.670 --> 03:54:43.680 align:start position:0%
Court and that's a case called Morrison
 
03:54:45.469 --> 03:54:45.479 align:start position:0%
versus old that was the independent
 
03:54:47.110 --> 03:54:47.120 align:start position:0%
Council statute and the Supreme Court
 
03:54:48.950 --> 03:54:48.960 align:start position:0%
said that there are adequate checks for
 
03:54:50.990 --> 03:54:51.000 align:start position:0%
that independent Council to do its work
 
03:54:52.870 --> 03:54:52.880 align:start position:0%
the independent Council needs to be
 
03:54:54.670 --> 03:54:54.680 align:start position:0%
independent but there was enough
 
03:54:58.750 --> 03:54:58.760 align:start position:0%
executive branch oversight um to uh to
 
03:55:00.590 --> 03:55:00.600 align:start position:0%
eliminate any constitutional problems
 
03:55:02.750 --> 03:55:02.760 align:start position:0%
it's exactly the scenario that we have
 
03:55:06.269 --> 03:55:06.279 align:start position:0%
here with respect to um the OCA that is
 
03:55:09.030 --> 03:55:09.040 align:start position:0%
to say the OCA and this bill are
 
03:55:10.670 --> 03:55:10.680 align:start position:0%
constitutional really for all of the
 
03:55:12.870 --> 03:55:12.880 align:start position:0%
same reasons that the independent uh
 
03:55:15.590 --> 03:55:15.600 align:start position:0%
Council statute was constitutional in
 
03:55:17.990 --> 03:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
Morrison over 30 years
 
03:55:21.309 --> 03:55:21.319 align:start position:0%
ago um and also I think there's no
 
03:55:23.070 --> 03:55:23.080 align:start position:0%
separation of power concern issue here
 
03:55:25.229 --> 03:55:25.239 align:start position:0%
as well because the governor and
 
03:55:27.830 --> 03:55:27.840 align:start position:0%
executive Council of course appoint the
 
03:55:30.269 --> 03:55:30.279 align:start position:0%
OCA uh it's true that there's an
 
03:55:32.110 --> 03:55:32.120 align:start position:0%
oversight commission that's tasked with
 
03:55:34.389 --> 03:55:34.399 align:start position:0%
recommending the director of the OCA but
 
03:55:36.950 --> 03:55:36.960 align:start position:0%
the bill does not require that the
 
03:55:38.950 --> 03:55:38.960 align:start position:0%
governor and executive Council adopt
 
03:55:40.269 --> 03:55:40.279 align:start position:0%
actually any of those recommended
 
03:55:42.429 --> 03:55:42.439 align:start position:0%
candidates that's actually appropriate
 
03:55:45.349 --> 03:55:45.359 align:start position:0%
in order to eliminate separate of powers
 
03:55:47.830 --> 03:55:47.840 align:start position:0%
concerns and to eliminate any concern
 
03:55:50.550 --> 03:55:50.560 align:start position:0%
that this could become a rogue
 
03:55:54.309 --> 03:55:54.319 align:start position:0%
agency the third point I want to make um
 
03:55:56.389 --> 03:55:56.399 align:start position:0%
and it relates to my introductory
 
03:55:59.349 --> 03:55:59.359 align:start position:0%
remarks is that as a policy Choice the
 
03:56:01.830 --> 03:56:01.840 align:start position:0%
legislature can give investig
 
03:56:04.070 --> 03:56:04.080 align:start position:0%
investigatory powers to another
 
03:56:06.389 --> 03:56:06.399 align:start position:0%
executive branch agency that's just not
 
03:56:08.030 --> 03:56:08.040 align:start position:0%
the Department of Justice that's what
 
03:56:09.469 --> 03:56:09.479 align:start position:0%
this bill is doing there are good
 
03:56:12.750 --> 03:56:12.760 align:start position:0%
reasons to actually um embed these
 
03:56:15.189 --> 03:56:15.199 align:start position:0%
Powers with a non-e department Justice
 
03:56:17.750 --> 03:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
agency um I I won't get into the legal
 
03:56:19.950 --> 03:56:19.960 align:start position:0%
analysis there of why that's appropriate
 
03:56:21.550 --> 03:56:21.560 align:start position:0%
but it's something that certainly can be
 
03:56:24.870 --> 03:56:24.880 align:start position:0%
done by Statute that is what this uh
 
03:56:26.750 --> 03:56:26.760 align:start position:0%
this bill does and again to reiterate
 
03:56:28.309 --> 03:56:28.319 align:start position:0%
it's embedding these investigatory
 
03:56:30.550 --> 03:56:30.560 align:start position:0%
Powers within one of the three branches
 
03:56:32.750 --> 03:56:32.760 align:start position:0%
of government the executive branch not
 
03:56:35.990 --> 03:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
the not uh a a fourth Branch so with
 
03:56:38.550 --> 03:56:38.560 align:start position:0%
that I'll conclude my testimony uh which
 
03:56:40.429 --> 03:56:40.439 align:start position:0%
which I also U submitted last night
 
03:56:42.950 --> 03:56:42.960 align:start position:0%
thank you very much very good uh we did
 
03:56:46.670 --> 03:56:46.680 align:start position:0%
get your testimony thank you uh so any
 
03:56:50.670 --> 03:56:50.680 align:start position:0%
questions um of Mr
 
03:56:55.389 --> 03:56:55.399 align:start position:0%
Binet I don't see any so uh thank you Mr
 
03:56:59.110 --> 03:56:59.120 align:start position:0%
Binet and I don't believe uh Christina
 
03:57:01.389 --> 03:57:01.399 align:start position:0%
are there any others that I'm not seeing
 
03:57:03.870 --> 03:57:03.880 align:start position:0%
that are willing to that are wanting to
 
03:57:07.149 --> 03:57:07.159 align:start position:0%
testify I do not see any hands raised at
 
03:57:08.790 --> 03:57:08.800 align:start position:0%
this point and everyone on the list has
 
03:57:11.030 --> 03:57:11.040 align:start position:0%
testified very good so I'll close the
 
03:57:14.830 --> 03:57:14.840 align:start position:0%
hearing on Senate Bill 295
 
03:57:20.910 --> 03:57:20.920 align:start position:0%

want to do uh it's five o'clock you want

and

04:08:47.670 --> 04:08:47.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:08:47.680 --> 04:08:53.550 align:start position:0%
and
discussion

04:08:53.550 --> 04:08:53.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:58.590 --> 04:08:58.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:02.269 --> 04:09:02.279 align:start position:0%
deimon thank you Mr chair
 
04:09:09.389 --> 04:09:09.399 align:start position:0%
um uh we are back from um our caucus and
 
04:09:13.830 --> 04:09:13.840 align:start position:0%
um we definitely would not
 
04:09:17.349 --> 04:09:17.359 align:start position:0%
um I'm not seeing anybody that wants
 
04:09:17.359 --> 04:09:18.830 align:start position:0%
um I'm not seeing anybody that wants
interim

04:09:18.830 --> 04:09:18.840 align:start position:0%
interim
 
04:09:22.910 --> 04:09:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:28.469 --> 04:09:28.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:31.590 --> 04:09:31.600 align:start position:0%
discussion see none when when the uh
 
04:09:34.109 --> 04:09:34.119 align:start position:0%
clerk is actually I got representative
 
04:09:38.710 --> 04:09:38.720 align:start position:0%
horn thank you Mr chairman um I think my
 
04:09:41.229 --> 04:09:41.239 align:start position:0%
big objection to interim study would be
 
04:09:44.550 --> 04:09:44.560 align:start position:0%
along the lines of we heard plenty of
 
04:09:47.109 --> 04:09:47.119 align:start position:0%
testimony today that there's something
 
04:09:49.670 --> 04:09:49.680 align:start position:0%
um unjust about the system that's
 
04:09:54.830 --> 04:09:54.840 align:start position:0%
currently in place and that maybe more
 
04:09:56.790 --> 04:09:56.800 align:start position:0%
attention would be paid to the situation
 
04:10:00.309 --> 04:10:00.319 align:start position:0%
if we have if we adopt HB
 
04:10:03.830 --> 04:10:03.840 align:start position:0%
1716 um it would send a message I
 
04:10:05.950 --> 04:10:05.960 align:start position:0%
believe that this is something that
 
04:10:09.269 --> 04:10:09.279 align:start position:0%
needs attention that
 
04:10:12.030 --> 04:10:12.040 align:start position:0%
uh while we may lack the statutory
 
04:10:14.269 --> 04:10:14.279 align:start position:0%
authority to affect the Federal
 
04:10:16.309 --> 04:10:16.319 align:start position:0%
standards um the federal standards are
 
04:10:18.950 --> 04:10:18.960 align:start position:0%
obviously not working so rather than
 
04:10:22.349 --> 04:10:22.359 align:start position:0%
interim study which in the covid-19
 
04:10:24.910 --> 04:10:24.920 align:start position:0%
situation is unlikely to have anything
 
04:10:28.550 --> 04:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
done on it um I would suggest that we
 
04:10:33.710 --> 04:10:33.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:38.269 --> 04:10:38.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:41.389 --> 04:10:41.399 align:start position:0%
rice yes thank you um I I agree with
 
04:10:44.070 --> 04:10:44.080 align:start position:0%
representative horn I don't think that
 
04:10:46.830 --> 04:10:46.840 align:start position:0%
kicking this to the curb is the answer
 
04:10:50.710 --> 04:10:50.720 align:start position:0%
um interim study is a polite death and I
 
04:10:53.389 --> 04:10:53.399 align:start position:0%
just don't see I think this is something
 
04:10:55.510 --> 04:10:55.520 align:start position:0%
that needs to be addressed
 
04:10:59.349 --> 04:10:59.359 align:start position:0%
now thank you good and I I I don't see
 
04:11:01.710 --> 04:11:01.720 align:start position:0%
this has kicken it to the curb uh has
 
04:11:03.750 --> 04:11:03.760 align:start position:0%
representative horn said that maybe
 
04:11:06.389 --> 04:11:06.399 align:start position:0%
something will happen I I'm not
 
04:11:10.469 --> 04:11:10.479 align:start position:0%
comfortable with um with passing
 
04:11:14.269 --> 04:11:14.279 align:start position:0%
supporting a bill that may do something
 
04:11:14.279 --> 04:11:15.309 align:start position:0%
supporting a bill that may do something
um

04:11:15.309 --> 04:11:15.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:11:19.229 --> 04:11:19.239 align:start position:0%
I in testimony the the emphasis was on
 
04:11:21.070 --> 04:11:21.080 align:start position:0%
the state following the federal
 
04:11:24.510 --> 04:11:24.520 align:start position:0%
guidelines we've heard of that uh and
 
04:11:29.030 --> 04:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:31.550 --> 04:11:31.560 align:start position:0%
um what was it there was a there was a
 
04:11:34.870 --> 04:11:34.880 align:start position:0%
house bill that's addressing this this
 
04:11:39.429 --> 04:11:39.439 align:start position:0%
standard uh the guideline standard which
 
04:11:42.149 --> 04:11:42.159 align:start position:0%
appears to me would be the Avenue with
 
04:11:45.750 --> 04:11:45.760 align:start position:0%
which this we would go I I'm
 
04:11:49.510 --> 04:11:49.520 align:start position:0%
un I mean a lot of testimony was on
 
04:11:49.520 --> 04:11:51.109 align:start position:0%
un I mean a lot of testimony was on
several

04:11:51.109 --> 04:11:51.119 align:start position:0%
several
 
04:11:54.670 --> 04:11:54.680 align:start position:0%
Federal uh Federal um statutes or
 
04:11:57.030 --> 04:11:57.040 align:start position:0%
whatever they call them
 
04:12:00.469 --> 04:12:00.479 align:start position:0%
um of which I I've been trying to get
 
04:12:02.710 --> 04:12:02.720 align:start position:0%
answers to some of these and I I just
 
04:12:06.910 --> 04:12:06.920 align:start position:0%
couldn't get them um you know I I had
 
04:12:09.389 --> 04:12:09.399 align:start position:0%
questions that I couldn't get answered
 
04:12:14.349 --> 04:12:14.359 align:start position:0%
so I don't feel that the passage of uh
 
04:12:15.510 --> 04:12:15.520 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
04:12:18.269 --> 04:12:18.279 align:start position:0%
1716 is going to address it what it will
 
04:12:22.269 --> 04:12:22.279 align:start position:0%
do is throw everything at a stir I and
 
04:12:24.550 --> 04:12:24.560 align:start position:0%
I'm not I'm not prepared to support
 
04:12:26.750 --> 04:12:26.760 align:start position:0%
something that that'll do that I don't
 
04:12:29.710 --> 04:12:29.720 align:start position:0%
believe this passage helps the issue
 
04:12:32.510 --> 04:12:32.520 align:start position:0%
that we're looking to address uh so
 
04:12:32.520 --> 04:12:36.389 align:start position:0%
that we're looking to address uh so
representative

04:12:36.389 --> 04:12:36.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:41.149 --> 04:12:41.159 align:start position:0%
yella thank you um I think that the what
 
04:12:44.309 --> 04:12:44.319 align:start position:0%
the testimony showed us today is that
 
04:12:44.319 --> 04:12:45.469 align:start position:0%
the testimony showed us today is that
the

04:12:45.469 --> 04:12:45.479 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:12:48.590 --> 04:12:48.600 align:start position:0%
um more not so much the federal
 
04:12:52.510 --> 04:12:52.520 align:start position:0%
guidelines but our specific custody or
 
04:12:56.030 --> 04:12:56.040 align:start position:0%
child support formula is broken and that
 
04:12:58.750 --> 04:12:58.760 align:start position:0%
we need to address that and that is
 
04:13:02.389 --> 04:13:02.399 align:start position:0%
something that I think that um both
 
04:13:06.750 --> 04:13:06.760 align:start position:0%
sides uh of this issue uh would support
 
04:13:11.189 --> 04:13:11.199 align:start position:0%
moving forward with and so I think that
 
04:13:15.030 --> 04:13:15.040 align:start position:0%
there is some appetite for trying to
 
04:13:17.030 --> 04:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
address that issue in a
 
04:13:19.910 --> 04:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
more holistic way I guess instead of
 
04:13:22.910 --> 04:13:22.920 align:start position:0%
peac meiling trying to attack each
 
04:13:25.910 --> 04:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
individual problem that the child
 
04:13:29.429 --> 04:13:29.439 align:start position:0%
support formula creates and
 
04:13:33.269 --> 04:13:33.279 align:start position:0%
so um as long as we're moving forward
 
04:13:35.950 --> 04:13:35.960 align:start position:0%
with that issue um and trying to fix
 
04:13:38.030 --> 04:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
that formula I think that um I think
 
04:13:40.189 --> 04:13:40.199 align:start position:0%
we're on the right
 
04:13:44.910 --> 04:13:44.920 align:start position:0%
path um I have a representative uh
 
04:13:47.630 --> 04:13:47.640 align:start position:0%
Weber Mr chairman and thank you all for
 
04:13:50.790 --> 04:13:50.800 align:start position:0%
your hospitality um I spent a certain
 
04:13:53.349 --> 04:13:53.359 align:start position:0%
amount of time while we were listening
 
04:13:56.349 --> 04:13:56.359 align:start position:0%
to testimony also reading some of the
 
04:13:59.710 --> 04:13:59.720 align:start position:0%
federal statutes that were cited
 
04:14:03.030 --> 04:14:03.040 align:start position:0%
and while my heart just
 
04:14:06.630 --> 04:14:06.640 align:start position:0%
aches for the people who
 
04:14:09.710 --> 04:14:09.720 align:start position:0%
are caught in this particular bind I
 
04:14:11.429 --> 04:14:11.439 align:start position:0%
think that representative yella is
 
04:14:14.109 --> 04:14:14.119 align:start position:0%
correct it needs to be looked at
 
04:14:17.189 --> 04:14:17.199 align:start position:0%
globally if we just proceed with this
 
04:14:20.389 --> 04:14:20.399 align:start position:0%
particular bill I do believe having
 
04:14:22.750 --> 04:14:22.760 align:start position:0%
looked at it and I this is not the kind
 
04:14:26.030 --> 04:14:26.040 align:start position:0%
of attorney I am I got to tell you um
 
04:14:28.630 --> 04:14:28.640 align:start position:0%
and I'm long past my cell by date as an
 
04:14:31.469 --> 04:14:31.479 align:start position:0%
attorney anyway uh but the federal
 
04:14:34.269 --> 04:14:34.279 align:start position:0%
statute is talking about what you may do
 
04:14:37.469 --> 04:14:37.479 align:start position:0%
not what you must do
 
04:14:40.109 --> 04:14:40.119 align:start position:0%
and that's the one that they were citing
 
04:14:43.229 --> 04:14:43.239 align:start position:0%
and the one that the um informational
 
04:14:46.349 --> 04:14:46.359 align:start position:0%
message came out about and at the same
 
04:14:48.830 --> 04:14:48.840 align:start position:0%
time there is the other statute that
 
04:14:51.429 --> 04:14:51.439 align:start position:0%
does in fact require us to take all
 
04:14:55.309 --> 04:14:55.319 align:start position:0%
income into account and so I think that
 
04:14:59.229 --> 04:14:59.239 align:start position:0%
by trying to fix one specific problem
 
04:15:02.550 --> 04:15:02.560 align:start position:0%
with this one specific Bill we are very
 
04:15:05.630 --> 04:15:05.640 align:start position:0%
likely to get ourselves into a larger
 
04:15:07.910 --> 04:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
mess and a larger morass that's going to
 
04:15:10.870 --> 04:15:10.880 align:start position:0%
affect even more people so I think that
 
04:15:15.910 --> 04:15:15.920 align:start position:0%
the the broader more Global look is is a
 
04:15:18.710 --> 04:15:18.720 align:start position:0%
better way to go thank
 
04:15:22.510 --> 04:15:22.520 align:start position:0%
you uh Christina I I just got a text uh
 
04:15:26.030 --> 04:15:26.040 align:start position:0%
Cassie representative L is not able to
 
04:15:28.630 --> 04:15:28.640 align:start position:0%
get back in for some reason I've got her
 
04:15:31.149 --> 04:15:31.159 align:start position:0%
thank you she'll be in just a moment
 
04:15:33.349 --> 04:15:33.359 align:start position:0%
very good representative
 
04:15:37.550 --> 04:15:37.560 align:start position:0%
Baran yeah thank you um I I I I agree
 
04:15:41.189 --> 04:15:41.199 align:start position:0%
with uh with representative yella and U
 
04:15:43.750 --> 04:15:43.760 align:start position:0%
representative Weber um I in fact have
 
04:15:47.950 --> 04:15:47.960 align:start position:0%
been working with um uh Brenda Town who
 
04:15:51.189 --> 04:15:51.199 align:start position:0%
was a woman who spoke towards the end um
 
04:15:53.389 --> 04:15:53.399 align:start position:0%
and explained about a group that she's
 
04:15:55.750 --> 04:15:55.760 align:start position:0%
been working with and we've been working
 
04:15:58.750 --> 04:15:58.760 align:start position:0%
together for about the last oh three or
 
04:16:02.149 --> 04:16:02.159 align:start position:0%
four months to try and address some of
 
04:16:05.309 --> 04:16:05.319 align:start position:0%
the issues around equal parenting and
 
04:16:07.630 --> 04:16:07.640 align:start position:0%
she obviously is was concerned about
 
04:16:12.149 --> 04:16:12.159 align:start position:0%
this this issue as well and um uh I
 
04:16:15.309 --> 04:16:15.319 align:start position:0%
think that um expanding on the what what
 
04:16:18.149 --> 04:16:18.159 align:start position:0%
should be the work of of
 
04:16:23.590 --> 04:16:23.600 align:start position:0%
HB 362 in interim study is important and
 
04:16:25.670 --> 04:16:25.680 align:start position:0%
um I've kind of agreed as most of you
 
04:16:27.590 --> 04:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
know I'm going to be leaving the house
 
04:16:30.469 --> 04:16:30.479 align:start position:0%
but um over the in the fall trying to
 
04:16:33.910 --> 04:16:33.920 align:start position:0%
really work to um pull these various
 
04:16:37.309 --> 04:16:37.319 align:start position:0%
threads together working with the and
 
04:16:40.189 --> 04:16:40.199 align:start position:0%
also using the work that the
 
04:16:44.309 --> 04:16:44.319 align:start position:0%
UNH um report had um to be able to come
 
04:16:46.590 --> 04:16:46.600 align:start position:0%
together with some sort of comprehensive
 
04:16:50.510 --> 04:16:50.520 align:start position:0%
com uh legislation for um that you all
 
04:16:54.429 --> 04:16:54.439 align:start position:0%
can introduce next uh next
 
04:16:58.429 --> 04:16:58.439 align:start position:0%
year so and I I that's why I'm going
 
04:16:59.990 --> 04:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
with inter
 
04:17:03.070 --> 04:17:03.080 align:start position:0%
study representative
 
04:17:05.630 --> 04:17:05.640 align:start position:0%
deimon thank you Mr
 
04:17:10.030 --> 04:17:10.040 align:start position:0%
chair I really think that it's time to
 
04:17:13.590 --> 04:17:13.600 align:start position:0%
stop allowing people
 
04:17:15.990 --> 04:17:16.000 align:start position:0%
um to live the way they're living
 
04:17:17.550 --> 04:17:17.560 align:start position:0%
especially the
 
04:17:20.990 --> 04:17:21.000 align:start position:0%
veterans this is a compensation that is
 
04:17:22.349 --> 04:17:22.359 align:start position:0%
this is not
 
04:17:26.750 --> 04:17:26.760 align:start position:0%
income these people are physically and
 
04:17:29.830 --> 04:17:29.840 align:start position:0%
mentally injured for the rest of their
 
04:17:33.750 --> 04:17:33.760 align:start position:0%
lives this money is not income it should
 
04:17:36.269 --> 04:17:36.279 align:start position:0%
not be considered
 
04:17:40.870 --> 04:17:40.880 align:start position:0%
income it is not federally tax
 
04:17:44.670 --> 04:17:44.680 align:start position:0%
taxed therefore we we should vote to
 
04:17:48.950 --> 04:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
pass this bill and get these veterans
 
04:17:52.550 --> 04:17:52.560 align:start position:0%
back in society and give them their
 
04:17:52.560 --> 04:17:53.750 align:start position:0%
back in society and give them their
money

04:17:53.750 --> 04:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
money
 
04:17:56.429 --> 04:17:56.439 align:start position:0%
back thank
 
04:17:58.990 --> 04:17:59.000 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
04:18:01.070 --> 04:18:01.080 align:start position:0%
horn Mr
 
04:18:04.070 --> 04:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
chairman I
 
04:18:08.670 --> 04:18:08.680 align:start position:0%
uh I know that in the past states have
 
04:18:12.149 --> 04:18:12.159 align:start position:0%
taken up legislation when they feel that
 
04:18:14.950 --> 04:18:14.960 align:start position:0%
uh an issue is important enough we
 
04:18:16.990 --> 04:18:17.000 align:start position:0%
haven't seen a constitutional convention
 
04:18:20.469 --> 04:18:20.479 align:start position:0%
in this country because if enough States
 
04:18:22.309 --> 04:18:22.319 align:start position:0%
pass a certain type of legislation
 
04:18:26.670 --> 04:18:26.680 align:start position:0%
Congress gets off their tases and passes
 
04:18:28.510 --> 04:18:28.520 align:start position:0%
the amendments to the Constitution that
 
04:18:31.229 --> 04:18:31.239 align:start position:0%
the states wanted in the first place so
 
04:18:32.469 --> 04:18:32.479 align:start position:0%
we've never had a constitutional
 
04:18:35.189 --> 04:18:35.199 align:start position:0%
convention for that specific reason I
 
04:18:38.510 --> 04:18:38.520 align:start position:0%
feel strongly that by New Hampshire
 
04:18:40.349 --> 04:18:40.359 align:start position:0%
sending a message that the federal
 
04:18:43.910 --> 04:18:43.920 align:start position:0%
system that manages this affair isn't
 
04:18:46.830 --> 04:18:46.840 align:start position:0%
protecting our veterans we give this
 
04:18:48.790 --> 04:18:48.800 align:start position:0%
Congress the same opportunity to amend
 
04:18:50.910 --> 04:18:50.920 align:start position:0%
the federal statutes to reflect what is
 
04:18:54.349 --> 04:18:54.359 align:start position:0%
fair and what is just um there is a huge
 
04:18:55.750 --> 04:18:55.760 align:start position:0%
difference between Social Security
 
04:18:58.189 --> 04:18:58.199 align:start position:0%
disability and the Veterans Affairs
 
04:19:00.750 --> 04:19:00.760 align:start position:0%
disability which is not being recognized
 
04:19:03.070 --> 04:19:03.080 align:start position:0%
in the system at the point at this point
 
04:19:06.870 --> 04:19:06.880 align:start position:0%
so I I would urge my colleagues to uh
 
04:19:10.870 --> 04:19:10.880 align:start position:0%
consider voting no on is so that we can
 
04:19:12.870 --> 04:19:12.880 align:start position:0%
adopt this legislation and send our our
 
04:19:14.670 --> 04:19:14.680 align:start position:0%
delegation in Washington a signal that
 
04:19:16.750 --> 04:19:16.760 align:start position:0%
hey pay attention to this because people
 
04:19:18.269 --> 04:19:18.279 align:start position:0%
are dying because this is being
 
04:19:21.070 --> 04:19:21.080 align:start position:0%
mismanaged thank you Mr
 
04:19:24.590 --> 04:19:24.600 align:start position:0%
chairman representative
 
04:19:28.990 --> 04:19:29.000 align:start position:0%
camarota thank you chairman committee
 
04:19:33.070 --> 04:19:33.080 align:start position:0%
members in my short tenure I have seen
 
04:19:33.080 --> 04:19:35.429 align:start position:0%
members in my short tenure I have seen
our

04:19:35.429 --> 04:19:35.439 align:start position:0%
our
 
04:19:39.950 --> 04:19:39.960 align:start position:0%
committee attend to small details of a
 
04:19:43.710 --> 04:19:43.720 align:start position:0%
larger picture and pass the things with
 
04:19:47.750 --> 04:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
the hope that next time we can add a
 
04:19:51.429 --> 04:19:51.439 align:start position:0%
little bit more sometimes it's so big we
 
04:19:54.349 --> 04:19:54.359 align:start position:0%
can't get just can't do it it gets too
 
04:19:57.269 --> 04:19:57.279 align:start position:0%
convoluted so we do little and hope for
 
04:19:59.510 --> 04:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
the best and then do a little bit more
 
04:20:02.070 --> 04:20:02.080 align:start position:0%
I've seen that over and over again what
 
04:20:04.349 --> 04:20:04.359 align:start position:0%
I saw today is something that I'm very
 
04:20:08.670 --> 04:20:08.680 align:start position:0%
aware of and that is desperate
 
04:20:10.870 --> 04:20:10.880 align:start position:0%
people are
 
04:20:13.149 --> 04:20:13.159 align:start position:0%
veterans and the suicide
 
04:20:15.790 --> 04:20:15.800 align:start position:0%
rate is an
 
04:20:19.630 --> 04:20:19.640 align:start position:0%
incredible piece of data on Veterans and
 
04:20:22.550 --> 04:20:22.560 align:start position:0%
to have these people come forward to us
 
04:20:25.109 --> 04:20:25.119 align:start position:0%
saying they've been going through this
 
04:20:25.119 --> 04:20:26.429 align:start position:0%
saying they've been going through this
for

04:20:26.429 --> 04:20:26.439 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:20:30.229 --> 04:20:30.239 align:start position:0%
years is not acceptable there is no
 
04:20:35.550 --> 04:20:35.560 align:start position:0%
reason that we can't do this one piece
 
04:20:39.469 --> 04:20:39.479 align:start position:0%
to say we've got a serious problem and
 
04:20:44.269 --> 04:20:44.279 align:start position:0%
we want the feds or we can do maybe
 
04:20:46.910 --> 04:20:46.920 align:start position:0%
through uh
 
04:20:51.830 --> 04:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
SB 362 or HB 362 maybe we can even do
 
04:20:55.389 --> 04:20:55.399 align:start position:0%
better with that bill but this bill
 
04:20:58.429 --> 04:20:58.439 align:start position:0%
should we should say no to is and we
 
04:21:01.550 --> 04:21:01.560 align:start position:0%
should do a toath to help our veterans
 
04:21:05.870 --> 04:21:05.880 align:start position:0%
they are desperate we we our hearts are
 
04:21:08.149 --> 04:21:08.159 align:start position:0%
tugged when we talk about
 
04:21:11.309 --> 04:21:11.319 align:start position:0%
children we're talking about our
 
04:21:15.070 --> 04:21:15.080 align:start position:0%
veterans and they have done the most
 
04:21:18.269 --> 04:21:18.279 align:start position:0%
incredible service for our country and
 
04:21:20.030 --> 04:21:20.040 align:start position:0%
we need to help them and we need to help
 
04:21:23.910 --> 04:21:23.920 align:start position:0%
them be fathers most of them were men to
 
04:21:25.710 --> 04:21:25.720 align:start position:0%
their children which they kept saying
 
04:21:28.189 --> 04:21:28.199 align:start position:0%
over and over I can't take care of my
 
04:21:30.870 --> 04:21:30.880 align:start position:0%
child I I I have them for 60% of the
 
04:21:33.349 --> 04:21:33.359 align:start position:0%
time I have them for 50% and I can't
 
04:21:35.349 --> 04:21:35.359 align:start position:0%
have a one-bedroom I have to have a two
 
04:21:37.030 --> 04:21:37.040 align:start position:0%
bedroom and that takes away from the
 
04:21:41.630 --> 04:21:41.640 align:start position:0%
child it's absurd what we heard today so
 
04:21:45.710 --> 04:21:45.720 align:start position:0%
I um agree with Deb and Warner I I say
 
04:21:50.590 --> 04:21:50.600 align:start position:0%
no on is and it ought to ask thank
 
04:21:53.670 --> 04:21:53.680 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
04:21:58.469 --> 04:21:58.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:02.510 --> 04:22:02.520 align:start position:0%
T panetti thank you Mr
 
04:22:05.469 --> 04:22:05.479 align:start position:0%
Speaker I'm sorry as a substitute I
 
04:22:09.349 --> 04:22:09.359 align:start position:0%
don't know if if um I'm allowed to speak
 
04:22:11.149 --> 04:22:11.159 align:start position:0%
but I should speak as a
 
04:22:15.229 --> 04:22:15.239 align:start position:0%
veteran um we heard the pain uh that
 
04:22:16.910 --> 04:22:16.920 align:start position:0%
those veterans who
 
04:22:20.269 --> 04:22:20.279 align:start position:0%
testified uh shared with us we saw one
 
04:22:25.030 --> 04:22:25.040 align:start position:0%
of our own committee members um cry over
 
04:22:29.990 --> 04:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
it um I have myself gone through this uh
 
04:22:32.349 --> 04:22:32.359 align:start position:0%
about 35 40 years
 
04:22:32.359 --> 04:22:33.950 align:start position:0%
about 35 40 years
ago

04:22:33.950 --> 04:22:33.960 align:start position:0%
ago
 
04:22:36.309 --> 04:22:36.319 align:start position:0%
um there's not a whole lot of money that
 
04:22:39.109 --> 04:22:39.119 align:start position:0%
these veterans receive that's counted
 
04:22:42.109 --> 04:22:42.119 align:start position:0%
towards uh their total income that then
 
04:22:45.670 --> 04:22:45.680 align:start position:0%
has to be taken out and given to child
 
04:22:47.229 --> 04:22:47.239 align:start position:0%
support or
 
04:22:50.550 --> 04:22:50.560 align:start position:0%
whatever however it's
 
04:22:54.710 --> 04:22:54.720 align:start position:0%
dispensed it's very painful um and I'm
 
04:22:57.910 --> 04:22:57.920 align:start position:0%
not an injured vet I don't get
 
04:23:03.269 --> 04:23:03.279 align:start position:0%
disability um for them to um have to uh
 
04:23:06.469 --> 04:23:06.479 align:start position:0%
live the life they have to live with a
 
04:23:09.510 --> 04:23:09.520 align:start position:0%
disability with the money that comes out
 
04:23:12.790 --> 04:23:12.800 align:start position:0%
and then uh and then use that money uh
 
04:23:15.149 --> 04:23:15.159 align:start position:0%
not on their disability but for other
 
04:23:17.830 --> 04:23:17.840 align:start position:0%
things like child support not that they
 
04:23:19.269 --> 04:23:19.279 align:start position:0%
should they should definitely pay the
 
04:23:22.349 --> 04:23:22.359 align:start position:0%
child support but the money issue is is
 
04:23:25.670 --> 04:23:25.680 align:start position:0%
the the thing uh we heard them we heard
 
04:23:28.710 --> 04:23:28.720 align:start position:0%
their we saw their pain uh we just I
 
04:23:31.109 --> 04:23:31.119 align:start position:0%
don't think we can turn a cheek we've
 
04:23:35.389 --> 04:23:35.399 align:start position:0%
got to do something yes um we probably
 
04:23:37.070 --> 04:23:37.080 align:start position:0%
can't change it unless it change
 
04:23:40.030 --> 04:23:40.040 align:start position:0%
federally but we can shout out very loud
 
04:23:42.550 --> 04:23:42.560 align:start position:0%
to our federal delegate delegates that
 
04:23:44.429 --> 04:23:44.439 align:start position:0%
this definitely needs to be
 
04:23:47.950 --> 04:23:47.960 align:start position:0%
changed I believe interim study is the
 
04:23:49.429 --> 04:23:49.439 align:start position:0%
is a bad thing to do it's kind of
 
04:23:52.189 --> 04:23:52.199 align:start position:0%
turning the other cheek so my
 
04:23:54.070 --> 04:23:54.080 align:start position:0%
recommendation would be to vote no in
 
04:23:57.389 --> 04:23:57.399 align:start position:0%
inm study pass this send a message say
 
04:24:00.389 --> 04:24:00.399 align:start position:0%
listen it's about time we change we have
 
04:24:03.309 --> 04:24:03.319 align:start position:0%
to change this system this is wrong we
 
04:24:05.550 --> 04:24:05.560 align:start position:0%
all know it's wrong you know it's wrong
 
04:24:08.149 --> 04:24:08.159 align:start position:0%
I know it's wrong
 
04:24:11.870 --> 04:24:11.880 align:start position:0%
so do the right thing and really send
 
04:24:15.030 --> 04:24:15.040 align:start position:0%
the message to to the federal delegation
 
04:24:19.950 --> 04:24:19.960 align:start position:0%
no on in study yes on OTP thank
 
04:24:24.349 --> 04:24:24.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:27.990 --> 04:24:28.000 align:start position:0%
Corson yeah thank you Mr chairman um I
 
04:24:30.109 --> 04:24:30.119 align:start position:0%
find this incredibly difficult I've
 
04:24:32.070 --> 04:24:32.080 align:start position:0%
taken care of these folks medically and
 
04:24:34.229 --> 04:24:34.239 align:start position:0%
psychiatrically since
 
04:24:37.030 --> 04:24:37.040 align:start position:0%
1976 I've taken care of them in Kentucky
 
04:24:39.149 --> 04:24:39.159 align:start position:0%
and the coal mines I've taken care of
 
04:24:40.910 --> 04:24:40.920 align:start position:0%
them in the emergency rooms of
 
04:24:43.149 --> 04:24:43.159 align:start position:0%
Philadelphia Bost
 
04:24:46.070 --> 04:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
I've taken care of folks uh in all kinds
 
04:24:48.469 --> 04:24:48.479 align:start position:0%
of different environments who are the
 
04:24:52.389 --> 04:24:52.399 align:start position:0%
folks that we have never treated well in
 
04:24:54.990 --> 04:24:55.000 align:start position:0%
my experience over those 40 years they
 
04:24:58.109 --> 04:24:58.119 align:start position:0%
have never received what they should be
 
04:25:00.710 --> 04:25:00.720 align:start position:0%
receiving and we are trying to do
 
04:25:03.149 --> 04:25:03.159 align:start position:0%
something on the top of something that
 
04:25:06.990 --> 04:25:07.000 align:start position:0%
has been dismissed since n 1776 when we
 
04:25:08.469 --> 04:25:08.479 align:start position:0%
wouldn't pay the people that fought the
 
04:25:11.630 --> 04:25:11.640 align:start position:0%
Revolutionary War and this is more the
 
04:25:15.429 --> 04:25:15.439 align:start position:0%
same and so where I get stuck is it
 
04:25:17.550 --> 04:25:17.560 align:start position:0%
absolutely does need to change and I
 
04:25:19.910 --> 04:25:19.920 align:start position:0%
don't see this bill changing it I see
 
04:25:23.189 --> 04:25:23.199 align:start position:0%
this bill having us getting caught up in
 
04:25:26.590 --> 04:25:26.600 align:start position:0%
trying to do something on the surface of
 
04:25:28.750 --> 04:25:28.760 align:start position:0%
this problem that we just simply will
 
04:25:31.510 --> 04:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
not as a country take care of the way we
 
04:25:34.990 --> 04:25:35.000 align:start position:0%
should be taken care of and uh that
 
04:25:37.109 --> 04:25:37.119 align:start position:0%
leads me to the conclusion that I would
 
04:25:40.750 --> 04:25:40.760 align:start position:0%
not support the bill and I continue to
 
04:25:40.760 --> 04:25:43.469 align:start position:0%
not support the bill and I continue to
be

04:25:43.469 --> 04:25:43.479 align:start position:0%
be
 
04:25:45.550 --> 04:25:45.560 align:start position:0%
it's just hard to even know where to go
 
04:25:47.510 --> 04:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
with what my own personal experiences
 
04:25:51.389 --> 04:25:51.399 align:start position:0%
have been with hundreds thousands of
 
04:25:54.550 --> 04:25:54.560 align:start position:0%
people though over these decades and
 
04:25:56.429 --> 04:25:56.439 align:start position:0%
this is really disturbing but I can't
 
04:25:56.439 --> 04:25:58.670 align:start position:0%
this is really disturbing but I can't
support

04:25:58.670 --> 04:25:58.680 align:start position:0%
support
 
04:26:02.149 --> 04:26:02.159 align:start position:0%
it uh representative right I thought I
 
04:26:03.910 --> 04:26:03.920 align:start position:0%
saw your hand up here but I don't see
 
04:26:07.389 --> 04:26:07.399 align:start position:0%
you anymore you're
 
04:26:11.510 --> 04:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
okay okay so I'm sorry thank you um Mr
 
04:26:14.030 --> 04:26:14.040 align:start position:0%
chairman um
 
04:26:17.630 --> 04:26:17.640 align:start position:0%
so just so we're clear the federal aor
 
04:26:20.590 --> 04:26:20.600 align:start position:0%
apportionment part of this is supposed
 
04:26:22.750 --> 04:26:22.760 align:start position:0%
to be geared towards for the kids that's
 
04:26:24.950 --> 04:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
why they get it so why are we taking
 
04:26:26.990 --> 04:26:27.000 align:start position:0%
their other money and I do think we have
 
04:26:29.510 --> 04:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
to send a
 
04:26:33.349 --> 04:26:33.359 align:start position:0%
message because enough is enough I have
 
04:26:36.070 --> 04:26:36.080 align:start position:0%
I'm so Furious that the court didn't
 
04:26:38.349 --> 04:26:38.359 align:start position:0%
even give us the time to come here today
 
04:26:41.590 --> 04:26:41.600 align:start position:0%
and address any of this with us they
 
04:26:43.910 --> 04:26:43.920 align:start position:0%
have no accountability whatsoever and
 
04:26:46.590 --> 04:26:46.600 align:start position:0%
it's time that we take the ball by the
 
04:26:50.229 --> 04:26:50.239 align:start position:0%
horns and pass this bill not interim
 
04:26:53.189 --> 04:26:53.199 align:start position:0%
study it needs to be OTP show these
 
04:26:55.830 --> 04:26:55.840 align:start position:0%
veterans We Care I've had enough that's
 
04:26:58.349 --> 04:26:58.359 align:start position:0%
where I'm at I forgive me for yelling
 
04:27:00.750 --> 04:27:00.760 align:start position:0%
but this has been this was very
 
04:27:05.670 --> 04:27:05.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:09.790 --> 04:27:09.800 align:start position:0%
tired of hearing these stories I'm tired
 
04:27:13.189 --> 04:27:13.199 align:start position:0%
of it and we have to fix it and I'm
 
04:27:15.349 --> 04:27:15.359 align:start position:0%
voting a to pass I'm not voting for
 
04:27:20.109 --> 04:27:20.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:24.950 --> 04:27:24.960 align:start position:0%
you seeing uh seeing no more
 
04:27:27.149 --> 04:27:27.159 align:start position:0%
questions I'll ask representative
 
04:27:31.550 --> 04:27:31.560 align:start position:0%
