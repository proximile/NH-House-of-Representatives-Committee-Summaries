education Finance so today we have an
 
00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:14.460 align:start position:0%
agenda here and uh the first thing that
 
00:05:17.749 --> 00:05:17.759 align:start position:0%
I would like to do is that we've had of
 
00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:20.040 align:start position:0%
course this is education committee and
 
00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840 align:start position:0%
we deal with a lot of bills coming in
 
00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:23.580 align:start position:0%
that are curriculum oriented we deal
 
00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:25.139 align:start position:0%
with the academic standards and the
 
00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 align:start position:0%
minimum standards for public school
 
00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:27.529 align:start position:0%
minimum standards for public school
approval

00:05:27.529 --> 00:05:27.539 align:start position:0%
approval
 
00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:30.600 align:start position:0%
and in our looking at academic standards
 
00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:33.960 align:start position:0%
we oftentimes Wonder uh we the State
 
00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:36.780 align:start position:0%
Board sets those academic standards and
 
00:05:38.689 --> 00:05:38.699 align:start position:0%
the schools then integrate those
 
00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:40.440 align:start position:0%
standards into the curriculum which they
 
00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:42.800 align:start position:0%
adopt and they approve locally
 
00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:45.360 align:start position:0%
we oftentimes are wondering though when
 
00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:47.340 align:start position:0%
we we're looking at some of the outcomes
 
00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
that come out of the the classes and we
 
00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:52.020 align:start position:0%
look at and there's a lot of ways of
 
00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:53.580 align:start position:0%
having accountability we have the
 
00:05:55.189 --> 00:05:55.199 align:start position:0%
Statewide assessment here but there's
 
00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:56.940 align:start position:0%
some numerous ways as we all know of
 
00:05:59.270 --> 00:05:59.280 align:start position:0%
being Educators how we can you know
 
00:06:02.749 --> 00:06:02.759 align:start position:0%
ascertain whether a student has acquired
 
00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:04.620 align:start position:0%
that skills and knowledge and Concepts
 
00:06:07.249 --> 00:06:07.259 align:start position:0%
which we want but we are seeing things
 
00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:08.580 align:start position:0%
starting to slide a little bit
 
00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:10.440 align:start position:0%
especially in mathematics not just
 
00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
because of covid but they're sliding
 
00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:15.840 align:start position:0%
prior to that from last 10 years or so
 
00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:17.580 align:start position:0%
we've seen the achievement scores not
 
00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
being where they are whether the
 
00:06:20.689 --> 00:06:20.699 align:start position:0%
achievement tests are measuring what
 
00:06:23.409 --> 00:06:23.419 align:start position:0%
we're teaching I don't know
 
00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:27.060 align:start position:0%
and whether we're we we also know that
 
00:06:28.969 --> 00:06:28.979 align:start position:0%
there's to teach your shortage committee
 
00:06:30.529 --> 00:06:30.539 align:start position:0%
which we have here and that bill is put
 
00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:35.280 align:start position:0%
forth by Senator Khan last year was it
 
00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:38.520 align:start position:0%
um yeah and and and Ruth is now Senator
 
00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:41.100 align:start position:0%
Ward is now chairing that and we're
 
00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:42.600 align:start position:0%
noticing that we have a shortage to
 
00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:45.060 align:start position:0%
teachers in science mathematics special
 
00:06:50.029 --> 00:06:50.039 align:start position:0%
education and the math and the technical
 
00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:53.220 align:start position:0%
areas and and that's where it really
 
00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:57.180 align:start position:0%
identifies itself and so now we're
 
00:06:59.809 --> 00:06:59.819 align:start position:0%
looking at uh looking at our curriculum
 
00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:02.160 align:start position:0%
and we don't have the we we can only set
 
00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:03.720 align:start position:0%
up guidelines or Frameworks on this
 
00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:07.080 align:start position:0%
level it's up to the locals to to adopt
 
00:07:10.249 --> 00:07:10.259 align:start position:0%
and put their curriculum together but we
 
00:07:13.129 --> 00:07:13.139 align:start position:0%
want to today try to lean a little bit
 
00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:15.720 align:start position:0%
into what's going on at the higher
 
00:07:17.809 --> 00:07:17.819 align:start position:0%
education post-secondary levels in terms
 
00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:21.780 align:start position:0%
of teacher preparation and uh are the
 
00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:24.000 align:start position:0%
what being taught there does it align
 
00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:27.660 align:start position:0%
with uh what we're doing in our schools
 
00:07:28.909 --> 00:07:28.919 align:start position:0%
um it's been a number of years since
 
00:07:30.529 --> 00:07:30.539 align:start position:0%
I've been there so I really can't I
 
00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:32.220 align:start position:0%
don't have that information then that's
 
00:07:34.189 --> 00:07:34.199 align:start position:0%
why we've invited you know Brian and
 
00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:35.900 align:start position:0%
Tanya here today
 
00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:40.080 align:start position:0%
and and Dr Rubinstein and Shannon also
 
00:07:41.809 --> 00:07:41.819 align:start position:0%
from the community college system I know
 
00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:43.620 align:start position:0%
you're engaged with teacher preparation
 
00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:46.860 align:start position:0%
programs as well and and those tie in
 
00:07:48.469 --> 00:07:48.479 align:start position:0%
with what we have been discussing in
 
00:07:50.749 --> 00:07:50.759 align:start position:0%
past years when we were looking at HP
 
00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
1530 where the associate's degree just
 
00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:56.520 align:start position:0%
goes on and and and counts as those
 
00:07:58.010 --> 00:07:58.020 align:start position:0%
first two years you're coming as a
 
00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:01.380 align:start position:0%
junior uh we identified 30 major areas
 
00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:04.560 align:start position:0%
in which that it works and so I I
 
00:08:06.589 --> 00:08:06.599 align:start position:0%
believe in future meetings we will be
 
00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:08.520 align:start position:0%
discussing that in terms of is it
 
00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:10.500 align:start position:0%
working uh
 
00:08:12.529 --> 00:08:12.539 align:start position:0%
I don't know I've heard some places
 
00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:15.840 align:start position:0%
where it hasn't uh especially when we're
 
00:08:17.689 --> 00:08:17.699 align:start position:0%
dealing with going from into an
 
00:08:20.029 --> 00:08:20.039 align:start position:0%
engineering a very specific a degree
 
00:08:22.969 --> 00:08:22.979 align:start position:0%
area at the four-year level but getting
 
00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:25.080 align:start position:0%
back to the curricular areas I'd like to
 
00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:27.720 align:start position:0%
now just open it up if we can please if
 
00:08:30.469 --> 00:08:30.479 align:start position:0%
we can get an overview of of the teacher
 
00:08:32.149 --> 00:08:32.159 align:start position:0%
preparation programs that are leaning
 
00:08:33.769 --> 00:08:33.779 align:start position:0%
towards certification and our stay here
 
00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:37.560 align:start position:0%
K through 12 pre-k through 12.
 
00:08:39.909 --> 00:08:39.919 align:start position:0%
as well as you know
 
00:08:42.949 --> 00:08:42.959 align:start position:0%
identifying specifically at what is
 
00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:45.540 align:start position:0%
being done at the elementary levels uh
 
00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:48.720 align:start position:0%
in some of this uh I've met recently
 
00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:51.120 align:start position:0%
with teachers out in various school
 
00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:54.180 align:start position:0%
districts in several districts now and
 
00:08:56.990 --> 00:08:57.000 align:start position:0%
it seems that there's a almost a
 
00:08:59.870 --> 00:08:59.880 align:start position:0%
disconnect between what's going on at
 
00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:01.860 align:start position:0%
the secondary level versus what's going
 
00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:03.540 align:start position:0%
on at the elementary level as far as
 
00:09:06.009 --> 00:09:06.019 align:start position:0%
working and aligning together
 
00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
and what the expectations are so
 
00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:12.420 align:start position:0%
um what you're doing at the
 
00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:13.800 align:start position:0%
post-secondary level in terms of
 
00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:16.860 align:start position:0%
preparing our elementary teachers trying
 
00:09:18.769 --> 00:09:18.779 align:start position:0%
to get into some of the areas like are
 
00:09:20.509 --> 00:09:20.519 align:start position:0%
the skills and now it's being taught
 
00:09:23.449 --> 00:09:23.459 align:start position:0%
aside from the pedagogical type methods
 
00:09:23.459 --> 00:09:25.090 align:start position:0%
aside from the pedagogical type methods
uh

00:09:25.090 --> 00:09:25.100 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:27.660 align:start position:0%
I know at the secondary level if you're
 
00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:29.700 align:start position:0%
going to be teaching social studies you
 
00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
have a background in history or
 
00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:33.860 align:start position:0%
government Civics economics geography
 
00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:37.860 align:start position:0%
however in the elementary
 
00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:40.320 align:start position:0%
how well prepared are these teachers for
 
00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:42.540 align:start position:0%
the content
 
00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:44.760 align:start position:0%
I know of methods you know I brought in
 
00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
one of my old books which I had for the
 
00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:49.200 align:start position:0%
teaching of social studies that was
 
00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:52.440 align:start position:0%
written in 1984 and of course that was
 
00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:53.880 align:start position:0%
the second edition I had the first
 
00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:55.980 align:start position:0%
edition which was written around 1970
 
00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:57.350 align:start position:0%
edition which was written around 1970
and

00:09:57.350 --> 00:09:57.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:00.240 align:start position:0%
um that was all you know how to teach it
 
00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:02.040 align:start position:0%
didn't say what to teach
 
00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:04.260 align:start position:0%
and so maybe those are some of the
 
00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:06.540 align:start position:0%
things we can address a little bit in
 
00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:07.980 align:start position:0%
and I don't know who would like to go
 
00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:12.060 align:start position:0%
first Tanya or Brian go for it um okay
 
00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:13.980 align:start position:0%
so for our elementary education I can
 
00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:16.260 align:start position:0%
speak specifically for Keene State one
 
00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:18.120 align:start position:0%
of the things that um we have kind of
 
00:10:20.449 --> 00:10:20.459 align:start position:0%
held on to it is a public liberal art so
 
00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
we really value the liberal arts and all
 
00:10:24.829 --> 00:10:24.839 align:start position:0%
of our elementary majors are dual Majors
 
00:10:26.329 --> 00:10:26.339 align:start position:0%
that means that they major in elementary
 
00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:28.860 align:start position:0%
education and they have a liberal arts
 
00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:31.200 align:start position:0%
major and we kind of guide them to
 
00:10:33.769 --> 00:10:33.779 align:start position:0%
certain areas sometimes we allow them to
 
00:10:35.329 --> 00:10:35.339 align:start position:0%
kind of have a little freedom but that
 
00:10:37.009 --> 00:10:37.019 align:start position:0%
gives them a little more content and
 
00:10:39.949 --> 00:10:39.959 align:start position:0%
also connection to some other um some
 
00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:42.300 align:start position:0%
other courses people course offering
 
00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:43.860 align:start position:0%
some of those things that broaden their
 
00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
knowledge in addition to that we require
 
00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:49.560 align:start position:0%
two math courses that are specific for
 
00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:51.540 align:start position:0%
our elementary and students to build
 
00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
that content
 
00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:55.620 align:start position:0%
we also guide them when it comes to our
 
00:10:57.230 --> 00:10:57.240 align:start position:0%
ISP because we have the our general
 
00:10:59.630 --> 00:10:59.640 align:start position:0%
curriculum is an ISP the integrative
 
00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:01.620 align:start position:0%
studies program where they have to take
 
00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:05.100 align:start position:0%
courses in the Ia which is Arts IH which
 
00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:07.200 align:start position:0%
is Humanities in which is Natural
 
00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:09.720 align:start position:0%
Science and is which is social science
 
00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
and then the last one is integrated
 
00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
studies so a lot of times we'll guide
 
00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:16.620 align:start position:0%
them as they're choosing courses for
 
00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:19.260 align:start position:0%
example a great IH is one of the history
 
00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:21.420 align:start position:0%
courses that we recommend our students
 
00:11:23.090 --> 00:11:23.100 align:start position:0%
because it also helps prepare them for
 
00:11:26.210 --> 00:11:26.220 align:start position:0%
the practice to multi-subject tests and
 
00:11:27.829 --> 00:11:27.839 align:start position:0%
there's a bunch of other courses like an
 
00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:29.880 align:start position:0%
in there's a phenomenal science course
 
00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:33.240 align:start position:0%
that the students really enjoy so we try
 
00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
to guide them in courses that we think
 
00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:37.740 align:start position:0%
would benefit them as they continue on
 
00:11:41.329 --> 00:11:41.339 align:start position:0%
in education in addition to that we
 
00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:43.800 align:start position:0%
have set up our methods where Elementary
 
00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
methods one is kind of an integrated
 
00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:48.660 align:start position:0%
it's eight credits where it's a mixture
 
00:11:51.889 --> 00:11:51.899 align:start position:0%
of content pedagogy and time in the
 
00:11:54.949 --> 00:11:54.959 align:start position:0%
field and methods one is focuses on
 
00:11:58.250 --> 00:11:58.260 align:start position:0%
literacy and on um so and and social
 
00:12:01.069 --> 00:12:01.079 align:start position:0%
studies and our methods too focuses on
 
00:12:03.410 --> 00:12:03.420 align:start position:0%
math and science so they get another
 
00:12:05.569 --> 00:12:05.579 align:start position:0%
chance where they're taking the content
 
00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:07.800 align:start position:0%
that they've learned learning how to
 
00:12:10.190 --> 00:12:10.200 align:start position:0%
teach it and then applying it in the um
 
00:12:12.829 --> 00:12:12.839 align:start position:0%
schools that they're placed uh and then
 
00:12:14.329 --> 00:12:14.339 align:start position:0%
we have lesson plans that go beyond that
 
00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
and I should also add I know literacy is
 
00:12:18.889 --> 00:12:18.899 align:start position:0%
not considered maybe a Content area but
 
00:12:20.269 --> 00:12:20.279 align:start position:0%
we do have a course that they've taken
 
00:12:21.889 --> 00:12:21.899 align:start position:0%
that before they enter methods one
 
00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:23.940 align:start position:0%
because if we didn't then the entire
 
00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:25.800 align:start position:0%
methods one would just be about literacy
 
00:12:27.530 --> 00:12:27.540 align:start position:0%
and we don't want to shortchange the
 
00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:31.260 align:start position:0%
social studies piece in that course so I
 
00:12:33.650 --> 00:12:33.660 align:start position:0%
mean that's kind of a quick overview of
 
00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:35.880 align:start position:0%
what our students do but imagine that
 
00:12:38.269 --> 00:12:38.279 align:start position:0%
second liberal arts that's another 36 to
 
00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
44 credits and another content area that
 
00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:43.260 align:start position:0%
they're taking we also encourage our
 
00:12:45.769 --> 00:12:45.779 align:start position:0%
students to choose as their liberal arts
 
00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:49.260 align:start position:0%
the English one of the social studies or
 
00:12:51.650 --> 00:12:51.660 align:start position:0%
math or Sciences because it also opens
 
00:12:53.449 --> 00:12:53.459 align:start position:0%
them up to the opportunity when they
 
00:12:56.329 --> 00:12:56.339 align:start position:0%
finish they could switch from a KC k6
 
00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:00.120 align:start position:0%
licensure to a K-8 with those specific
 
00:13:02.810 --> 00:13:02.820 align:start position:0%
liberal arts
 
00:13:05.690 --> 00:13:05.700 align:start position:0%
does that answer is there anything it's
 
00:13:07.490 --> 00:13:07.500 align:start position:0%
like the quick overview are there any
 
00:13:10.490 --> 00:13:10.500 align:start position:0%
questions regarding that to where we are
 
00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:12.120 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:13:15.650 --> 00:13:15.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
um so Plymouth State University
 
00:13:23.449 --> 00:13:23.459 align:start position:0%
um some similarities to what happens at
 
00:13:26.810 --> 00:13:26.820 align:start position:0%
Keene uh so a few things um especially
 
00:13:28.970 --> 00:13:28.980 align:start position:0%
Elementary education so we have a k6 and
 
00:13:30.590 --> 00:13:30.600 align:start position:0%
K8 pathway
 
00:13:32.509 --> 00:13:32.519 align:start position:0%
um so first to clarify that piece the
 
00:13:35.389 --> 00:13:35.399 align:start position:0%
big difference between k6 and Ka is the
 
00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:37.620 align:start position:0%
K-8 pathway requires an additional 15
 
00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:39.050 align:start position:0%
K-8 pathway requires an additional 15
credits

00:13:39.050 --> 00:13:39.060 align:start position:0%
credits
 
00:13:42.410 --> 00:13:42.420 align:start position:0%
um uh to meet that that's what's
 
00:13:44.569 --> 00:13:44.579 align:start position:0%
outlined by the New Hampshire 612s all
 
00:13:47.090 --> 00:13:47.100 align:start position:0%
right so any student that's doing 16 is
 
00:13:49.129 --> 00:13:49.139 align:start position:0%
doing K8 has to have kind of like that
 
00:13:51.410 --> 00:13:51.420 align:start position:0%
content specialty area all right in
 
00:13:53.269 --> 00:13:53.279 align:start position:0%
addition to passing the Praxis too in
 
00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:56.160 align:start position:0%
that content area for what they're doing
 
00:13:58.490 --> 00:13:58.500 align:start position:0%
um then across the board
 
00:13:58.500 --> 00:13:59.389 align:start position:0%
um then across the board
um

00:13:59.389 --> 00:13:59.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:02.509 --> 00:14:02.519 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking about the k6 piece you know
 
00:14:04.069 --> 00:14:04.079 align:start position:0%
this breakdown between content and
 
00:14:04.079 --> 00:14:05.449 align:start position:0%
this breakdown between content and
pedagogy

00:14:05.449 --> 00:14:05.459 align:start position:0%
pedagogy
 
00:14:07.129 --> 00:14:07.139 align:start position:0%
um there is we try to make sure our
 
00:14:09.410 --> 00:14:09.420 align:start position:0%
students have like they have Elementary
 
00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:11.880 align:start position:0%
Ed they have multiple math classes
 
00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
geared towards that there are literacy
 
00:14:15.710 --> 00:14:15.720 align:start position:0%
courses as well that focuses on the
 
00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:17.700 align:start position:0%
content piece and then integrated into
 
00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:20.160 align:start position:0%
that into science and the social studies
 
00:14:21.710 --> 00:14:21.720 align:start position:0%
piece as well
 
00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
um similar to we also have with the
 
00:14:27.290 --> 00:14:27.300 align:start position:0%
content piece um try to ensure that the
 
00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:28.920 align:start position:0%
students through the general education
 
00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:31.980 align:start position:0%
program which is 42 to 47 credits
 
00:14:33.650 --> 00:14:33.660 align:start position:0%
um that they are taking certain classes
 
00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:34.980 align:start position:0%
as well all right they're going to
 
00:14:36.290 --> 00:14:36.300 align:start position:0%
really that build up their content
 
00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:37.680 align:start position:0%
knowledge for the teaching and what's
 
00:14:41.329 --> 00:14:41.339 align:start position:0%
expected to be taught in the history uh
 
00:14:43.069 --> 00:14:43.079 align:start position:0%
classroom or science classroom it's
 
00:14:45.050 --> 00:14:45.060 align:start position:0%
Fourth sixth grade really K through six
 
00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:48.600 align:start position:0%
as well because as you said is you don't
 
00:14:49.850 --> 00:14:49.860 align:start position:0%
have the content it's really hard to
 
00:14:51.650 --> 00:14:51.660 align:start position:0%
teach it all right one of the things
 
00:14:53.269 --> 00:14:53.279 align:start position:0%
that's really become important in this
 
00:14:55.129 --> 00:14:55.139 align:start position:0%
part of it is that our students when
 
00:14:57.650 --> 00:14:57.660 align:start position:0%
they are in their clinical experiences
 
00:14:58.790 --> 00:14:58.800 align:start position:0%
and they start having clinical
 
00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:01.500 align:start position:0%
experiences their first year right we've
 
00:15:03.769 --> 00:15:03.779 align:start position:0%
really embedded that piece so that they
 
00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:08.100 align:start position:0%
are spending time in classrooms in k6 or
 
00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:10.260 align:start position:0%
K-8 classrooms and even some of them you
 
00:15:12.650 --> 00:15:12.660 align:start position:0%
know this is just the elementary level
 
00:15:14.329 --> 00:15:14.339 align:start position:0%
um really getting a sense of what's
 
00:15:16.069 --> 00:15:16.079 align:start position:0%
happening in those classrooms so start
 
00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:17.760 align:start position:0%
thinking about it right it's not just to
 
00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:19.740 align:start position:0%
wait until the final year this is this
 
00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
early on the June it starts simple like
 
00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:24.060 align:start position:0%
a gradual progression they're doing
 
00:15:26.329 --> 00:15:26.339 align:start position:0%
observation work and then it you know
 
00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:28.380 align:start position:0%
the expectations go up with each year as
 
00:15:31.310 --> 00:15:31.320 align:start position:0%
they continue uh that last time being
 
00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
their junior year the third year they're
 
00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:35.220 align:start position:0%
implementing lesson plans and then
 
00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:37.380 align:start position:0%
getting ready our elementary education
 
00:15:39.530 --> 00:15:39.540 align:start position:0%
students do what we call a year-long
 
00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:41.940 align:start position:0%
internship whereas in the fall they stay
 
00:15:43.730 --> 00:15:43.740 align:start position:0%
we want them to see the whole cycle of
 
00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:45.120 align:start position:0%
the school year so in the fall they're
 
00:15:48.350 --> 00:15:48.360 align:start position:0%
there for a practicum for one day a week
 
00:15:50.210 --> 00:15:50.220 align:start position:0%
plus two full weeks and then they stay
 
00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:51.480 align:start position:0%
with that same teacher through the
 
00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:53.160 align:start position:0%
spring as well so they get an
 
00:15:55.250 --> 00:15:55.260 align:start position:0%
opportunity to see that whole scope and
 
00:15:56.750 --> 00:15:56.760 align:start position:0%
sequence in the classroom that they're
 
00:15:59.509 --> 00:15:59.519 align:start position:0%
placed in you know and through what we
 
00:16:03.050 --> 00:16:03.060 align:start position:0%
make sure is we use the 612 standard the
 
00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:05.120 align:start position:0%
content standards the guide what we do
 
00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:07.740 align:start position:0%
so that we make sure that our programs
 
00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:10.260 align:start position:0%
are aligned with the 612 standards for
 
00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
elementary education and if you take a
 
00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:13.260 align:start position:0%
look at those there since we're talking
 
00:16:14.930 --> 00:16:14.940 align:start position:0%
about social studies
 
00:16:16.970 --> 00:16:16.980 align:start position:0%
um they actually have them here but you
 
00:16:18.889 --> 00:16:18.899 align:start position:0%
know they outline who I know they
 
00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:21.480 align:start position:0%
outline the 10 different themes and the
 
00:16:23.569 --> 00:16:23.579 align:start position:0%
different areas with social studies that
 
00:16:25.310 --> 00:16:25.320 align:start position:0%
it's expected and we really make sure
 
00:16:27.769 --> 00:16:27.779 align:start position:0%
that our students have
 
00:16:29.930 --> 00:16:29.940 align:start position:0%
um that they have that as much as
 
00:16:32.689 --> 00:16:32.699 align:start position:0%
possible and getting ready I'll say well
 
00:16:36.949 --> 00:16:36.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:39.650 --> 00:16:39.660 align:start position:0%
representative thank you for being here
 
00:16:41.810 --> 00:16:41.820 align:start position:0%
I've I've got uh probably three
 
00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
questions one is um what's the history
 
00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:46.740 align:start position:0%
of your enrollment
 
00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:49.440 align:start position:0%
in these programs uh
 
00:16:53.090 --> 00:16:53.100 align:start position:0%
prior to and current uh also you
 
00:16:57.069 --> 00:16:57.079 align:start position:0%
indicated that uh the program
 
00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:00.720 align:start position:0%
development uh is aligned with the
 
00:17:04.669 --> 00:17:04.679 align:start position:0%
standards uh for this from the state I'd
 
00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
like to know a little bit more about
 
00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.010 align:start position:0%
like to know a little bit more about
that

00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:07.020 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:17:10.549 --> 00:17:10.559 align:start position:0%
and find the final question is how do
 
00:17:12.530 --> 00:17:12.540 align:start position:0%
you get feedback
 
00:17:14.990 --> 00:17:15.000 align:start position:0%
from uh the students who've gone through
 
00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:16.160 align:start position:0%
your program
 
00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:20.160 align:start position:0%
to ensure that the content and the
 
00:17:21.829 --> 00:17:21.839 align:start position:0%
development of your program is actually
 
00:17:25.010 --> 00:17:25.020 align:start position:0%
meeting the needs and it's not an ivory
 
00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:28.640 align:start position:0%
Tower approach uh to uh the the
 
00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:31.440 align:start position:0%
education of potential teachers but
 
00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:34.200 align:start position:0%
actually is meeting the actual needs as
 
00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
they're experiencing them in the field
 
00:17:37.130 --> 00:17:37.140 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:40.140 align:start position:0%
okay so let me I'll answer the last one
 
00:17:41.570 --> 00:17:41.580 align:start position:0%
first and then remind me of the other
 
00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:42.770 align:start position:0%
first and then remind me of the other
two

00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:42.780 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:45.240 align:start position:0%
we do and I and I know um Plymouth does
 
00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:48.240 align:start position:0%
as well we do Cape accreditation we do
 
00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:50.340 align:start position:0%
um also a lot of program review we'll
 
00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:51.780 align:start position:0%
both sit on the council for Teacher Ed
 
00:17:53.390 --> 00:17:53.400 align:start position:0%
so there's a lot of oversight on the Ed
 
00:17:55.070 --> 00:17:55.080 align:start position:0%
prep programs at the state level and
 
00:17:56.750 --> 00:17:56.760 align:start position:0%
then we do the national accreditation
 
00:17:58.730 --> 00:17:58.740 align:start position:0%
it's another level and the important
 
00:17:59.930 --> 00:17:59.940 align:start position:0%
thing about the doing the national
 
00:18:01.909 --> 00:18:01.919 align:start position:0%
accreditation and part of Cape is that
 
00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:04.200 align:start position:0%
it's not just getting uh surveys and
 
00:18:05.690 --> 00:18:05.700 align:start position:0%
focus and getting the feedback from the
 
00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:07.440 align:start position:0%
students in the program part of it is
 
00:18:08.890 --> 00:18:08.900 align:start position:0%
knowing where your students are going
 
00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:11.100 align:start position:0%
evaluating the impact that they have on
 
00:18:13.310 --> 00:18:13.320 align:start position:0%
their classrooms and doing surveys and
 
00:18:15.770 --> 00:18:15.780 align:start position:0%
focus groups with both completers and
 
00:18:18.650 --> 00:18:18.660 align:start position:0%
with employers like those who have hired
 
00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:20.400 align:start position:0%
our students to hear about the impact
 
00:18:22.010 --> 00:18:22.020 align:start position:0%
that they're having in the classrooms
 
00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:24.120 align:start position:0%
and that's for all of our programs not
 
00:18:25.610 --> 00:18:25.620 align:start position:0%
just for our elementary education
 
00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:28.260 align:start position:0%
programs so there's a lot of oversight
 
00:18:30.650 --> 00:18:30.660 align:start position:0%
and constant kind of review and this
 
00:18:33.049 --> 00:18:33.059 align:start position:0%
year we just finished our cape and state
 
00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:35.100 align:start position:0%
approval this year so one of the things
 
00:18:36.169 --> 00:18:36.179 align:start position:0%
that we're going to be spending our
 
00:18:37.730 --> 00:18:37.740 align:start position:0%
professional development we do every
 
00:18:39.409 --> 00:18:39.419 align:start position:0%
year but this is kind of a significant
 
00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:41.400 align:start position:0%
year because we just went through it is
 
00:18:43.850 --> 00:18:43.860 align:start position:0%
to really look back and say what are
 
00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:45.780 align:start position:0%
changes that we need to make based on
 
00:18:47.690 --> 00:18:47.700 align:start position:0%
what we hear or what we think
 
00:18:50.690 --> 00:18:50.700 align:start position:0%
improvements and another piece of that
 
00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:52.320 align:start position:0%
is we have an educator preparation
 
00:18:54.049 --> 00:18:54.059 align:start position:0%
advisory committee
 
00:18:56.870 --> 00:18:56.880 align:start position:0%
and that is where we meet I set up
 
00:18:58.610 --> 00:18:58.620 align:start position:0%
meetings and we have uh Representatives
 
00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:00.600 align:start position:0%
on that committee that are cooperating
 
00:19:03.049 --> 00:19:03.059 align:start position:0%
teachers we have students we have
 
00:19:05.870 --> 00:19:05.880 align:start position:0%
principals we have superintendents and
 
00:19:07.549 --> 00:19:07.559 align:start position:0%
the students are both our undergrad and
 
00:19:10.190 --> 00:19:10.200 align:start position:0%
our grad students and uh some faculty
 
00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:12.360 align:start position:0%
representation where we bring things
 
00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:14.160 align:start position:0%
that we're kind of discussing to really
 
00:19:15.950 --> 00:19:15.960 align:start position:0%
so for example we're reviewing our
 
00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:17.640 align:start position:0%
clinical and disposition evaluations
 
00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:19.860 align:start position:0%
those are kind of those unit-wide
 
00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
evaluations do they have the skills of a
 
00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:23.400 align:start position:0%
teacher do they have the dis
 
00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:25.860 align:start position:0%
professional disposition and we share
 
00:19:27.950 --> 00:19:27.960 align:start position:0%
with them to get feedback once they've
 
00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
used it does it make sense are there
 
00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:31.320 align:start position:0%
changes that need to meet does this
 
00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
reflect what's happening in the schools
 
00:19:35.029 --> 00:19:35.039 align:start position:0%
and that's just a continuous part of
 
00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
what the work that we do
 
00:19:39.169 --> 00:19:39.179 align:start position:0%
and then I think you asked about the um
 
00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:41.600 align:start position:0%
aligning with the 612s
 
00:19:43.909 --> 00:19:43.919 align:start position:0%
Brian brought the matrixes that the
 
00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
state sets up but we have to in all of
 
00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:47.640 align:start position:0%
our programs this is for all of our
 
00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:50.400 align:start position:0%
programs and for our unit we create um
 
00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:53.640 align:start position:0%
cross uh crosswalks that reference the
 
00:19:55.730 --> 00:19:55.740 align:start position:0%
state standard it references if we have
 
00:19:58.610 --> 00:19:58.620 align:start position:0%
any Spa like specialized standards the
 
00:20:00.590 --> 00:20:00.600 align:start position:0%
cape standards or whatever accreditation
 
00:20:02.930 --> 00:20:02.940 align:start position:0%
all those things across and we align it
 
00:20:04.730 --> 00:20:04.740 align:start position:0%
with coursework with assignments with
 
00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:07.980 align:start position:0%
key assessments so that we know where we
 
00:20:09.950 --> 00:20:09.960 align:start position:0%
are meeting all of those elements that
 
00:20:11.930 --> 00:20:11.940 align:start position:0%
are covered in the state standards and
 
00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:14.280 align:start position:0%
we do it by specific programs and then
 
00:20:17.570 --> 00:20:17.580 align:start position:0%
the Professional Standards as well and
 
00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:19.320 align:start position:0%
then I think the last question was oh do
 
00:20:20.450 --> 00:20:20.460 align:start position:0%
you want to add to that before you go
 
00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
into aeromics okay and then the Roman
 
00:20:26.810 --> 00:20:26.820 align:start position:0%
Trends across the state is or across the
 
00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:28.070 align:start position:0%
Trends across the state is or across the
country

00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
country
 
00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:30.600 align:start position:0%
um numbers in the Ed prep have gone down
 
00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:32.760 align:start position:0%
um I would say the the biggest tip we
 
00:20:34.789 --> 00:20:34.799 align:start position:0%
saw kind of was in I would say during
 
00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:36.600 align:start position:0%
covid but one of the things we've
 
00:20:38.029 --> 00:20:38.039 align:start position:0%
noticed since then the past two years
 
00:20:40.010 --> 00:20:40.020 align:start position:0%
our numbers have started going up
 
00:20:43.130 --> 00:20:43.140 align:start position:0%
slightly I would say our elementary
 
00:20:45.890 --> 00:20:45.900 align:start position:0%
major about 10 years ago it was so large
 
00:20:47.690 --> 00:20:47.700 align:start position:0%
that about half our graduates wouldn't
 
00:20:50.090 --> 00:20:50.100 align:start position:0%
even find jobs now we're at the point
 
00:20:52.370 --> 00:20:52.380 align:start position:0%
where our you know graduating class this
 
00:20:54.049 --> 00:20:54.059 align:start position:0%
year most of them already have job
 
00:20:56.810 --> 00:20:56.820 align:start position:0%
offers our numbers have come to a
 
00:20:58.310 --> 00:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
healthy level where they are finding
 
00:21:00.529 --> 00:21:00.539 align:start position:0%
jobs as they leave but our elementary Ed
 
00:21:03.350 --> 00:21:03.360 align:start position:0%
which is always the largest program is
 
00:21:05.990 --> 00:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
growing the secondary we've been kind of
 
00:21:07.669 --> 00:21:07.679 align:start position:0%
consistent it's dropped a little our
 
00:21:09.409 --> 00:21:09.419 align:start position:0%
English and our social studies tend to
 
00:21:11.210 --> 00:21:11.220 align:start position:0%
stay healthy our math and our science
 
00:21:13.669 --> 00:21:13.679 align:start position:0%
are the ones that fluctuate and I will
 
00:21:15.529 --> 00:21:15.539 align:start position:0%
be honest that because of our numbers in
 
00:21:17.390 --> 00:21:17.400 align:start position:0%
the science and the amount of work it
 
00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:19.020 align:start position:0%
takes to do that was the one that was
 
00:21:21.230 --> 00:21:21.240 align:start position:0%
put on hold by the institution not by
 
00:21:23.570 --> 00:21:23.580 align:start position:0%
something I want to do and I would love
 
00:21:25.730 --> 00:21:25.740 align:start position:0%
to bring it back but science which is a
 
00:21:27.950 --> 00:21:27.960 align:start position:0%
critical shortage it is hard and I think
 
00:21:29.450 --> 00:21:29.460 align:start position:0%
I mean that's something we can talk
 
00:21:31.610 --> 00:21:31.620 align:start position:0%
about in the teacher shortage like that
 
00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:33.240 align:start position:0%
recruitment piece or how do we get more
 
00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:35.640 align:start position:0%
students in teacher Ed but does that
 
00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:38.760 align:start position:0%
answer all three thank you
 
00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:42.909 align:start position:0%
answer all three thank you
foreign

00:21:42.909 --> 00:21:42.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:46.490 --> 00:21:46.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:48.480 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
Tanya I wonder well I want to sort of
 
00:21:54.169 --> 00:21:54.179 align:start position:0%
poke on something that that you just
 
00:21:57.470 --> 00:21:57.480 align:start position:0%
noted when when answering someone else's
 
00:21:59.750 --> 00:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
questions but uh they said what changes
 
00:22:01.850 --> 00:22:01.860 align:start position:0%
do we need to make based on what we're
 
00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:03.649 align:start position:0%
do we need to make based on what we're
hearing

00:22:03.649 --> 00:22:03.659 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
00:22:06.049 --> 00:22:06.059 align:start position:0%
and I wanted to sort of tie that back to
 
00:22:08.510 --> 00:22:08.520 align:start position:0%
what Rick was saying I'm sorry I'm being
 
00:22:10.549 --> 00:22:10.559 align:start position:0%
sort of just
 
00:22:13.850 --> 00:22:13.860 align:start position:0%
um you know easy going here it's Friday
 
00:22:16.909 --> 00:22:16.919 align:start position:0%
it's Friday yeah it's Friday yeah
 
00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:18.720 align:start position:0%
um but um
 
00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
tied back to what what Rick said at the
 
00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:23.880 align:start position:0%
top of the meeting which which um uh
 
00:22:26.870 --> 00:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
which and I and I and I think you so it
 
00:22:29.029 --> 00:22:29.039 align:start position:0%
sort of went to over the last decade
 
00:22:31.610 --> 00:22:31.620 align:start position:0%
we've seen a decline in in student
 
00:22:35.570 --> 00:22:35.580 align:start position:0%
performance in um in maths skills and
 
00:22:38.990 --> 00:22:39.000 align:start position:0%
and I guess I'm I I'm just taking the
 
00:22:40.850 --> 00:22:40.860 align:start position:0%
taking it at face value right now it's
 
00:22:42.830 --> 00:22:42.840 align:start position:0%
not looking at any information in front
 
00:22:46.490 --> 00:22:46.500 align:start position:0%
of me on it but have you been able to
 
00:22:49.970 --> 00:22:49.980 align:start position:0%
identify whether whether that that lack
 
00:22:53.149 --> 00:22:53.159 align:start position:0%
of student outcomes is tied to
 
00:22:56.270 --> 00:22:56.280 align:start position:0%
I mean a foundational math advanced math
 
00:23:00.409 --> 00:23:00.419 align:start position:0%
and then and then what are the causes of
 
00:23:00.419 --> 00:23:01.490 align:start position:0%
and then and then what are the causes of
it

00:23:01.490 --> 00:23:01.500 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:05.340 align:start position:0%
uh addressed by improved instruction or
 
00:23:07.970 --> 00:23:07.980 align:start position:0%
improved curriculum or some combination
 
00:23:10.549 --> 00:23:10.559 align:start position:0%
of both and what are you finding and how
 
00:23:13.310 --> 00:23:13.320 align:start position:0%
is that feeding back into
 
00:23:14.570 --> 00:23:14.580 align:start position:0%
um you know the sort of what we're
 
00:23:17.390 --> 00:23:17.400 align:start position:0%
hearing and what changes we need to make
 
00:23:19.250 --> 00:23:19.260 align:start position:0%
so I think
 
00:23:21.169 --> 00:23:21.179 align:start position:0%
the thing is is that in schools today
 
00:23:22.850 --> 00:23:22.860 align:start position:0%
it's hard because it's not just about
 
00:23:26.450 --> 00:23:26.460 align:start position:0%
academics I think teachers today have
 
00:23:28.730 --> 00:23:28.740 align:start position:0%
have to wear many hats and I think a lot
 
00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:30.840 align:start position:0%
of the social emotional the mental
 
00:23:32.330 --> 00:23:32.340 align:start position:0%
health and all these other pieces and
 
00:23:34.970 --> 00:23:34.980 align:start position:0%
covet take an impact on their ability to
 
00:23:37.610 --> 00:23:37.620 align:start position:0%
kind of um because they have to focus on
 
00:23:39.950 --> 00:23:39.960 align:start position:0%
those pieces to get to the academic so I
 
00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
think there's a lot more factors that
 
00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:45.000 align:start position:0%
come into play when you look into the
 
00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:47.940 align:start position:0%
test scores when it comes to math I
 
00:23:49.669 --> 00:23:49.679 align:start position:0%
would say that I think teachers amazing
 
00:23:51.890 --> 00:23:51.900 align:start position:0%
and doing the best that they can but
 
00:23:53.570 --> 00:23:53.580 align:start position:0%
some of it is more than just their
 
00:23:55.370 --> 00:23:55.380 align:start position:0%
training it's not about that it's about
 
00:23:57.350 --> 00:23:57.360 align:start position:0%
all the other factors coming in and
 
00:23:59.029 --> 00:23:59.039 align:start position:0%
making sure that they have the resources
 
00:24:02.570 --> 00:24:02.580 align:start position:0%
but I think another piece is is that we
 
00:24:05.029 --> 00:24:05.039 align:start position:0%
train and I'm speaking Brian for you two
 
00:24:07.669 --> 00:24:07.679 align:start position:0%
we teach our teachers not only the
 
00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:09.360 align:start position:0%
content but the pedagogy and the lesson
 
00:24:10.850 --> 00:24:10.860 align:start position:0%
planning and knowing your students and
 
00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:12.600 align:start position:0%
how to create lessons and how to engage
 
00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
them and a lot of schools rely on box
 
00:24:18.770 --> 00:24:18.780 align:start position:0%
curriculums and and that is sometimes
 
00:24:20.990 --> 00:24:21.000 align:start position:0%
limiting to these teachers that have
 
00:24:23.029 --> 00:24:23.039 align:start position:0%
been trained to really meet the needs of
 
00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:24.840 align:start position:0%
students and create lessons that would
 
00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:27.360 align:start position:0%
engage them and challenge them meet them
 
00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:29.880 align:start position:0%
where they are differentiate so I think
 
00:24:31.850 --> 00:24:31.860 align:start position:0%
that is something that is not about what
 
00:24:33.470 --> 00:24:33.480 align:start position:0%
we do but something that is a larger
 
00:24:35.289 --> 00:24:35.299 align:start position:0%
discussion to have
 
00:24:38.450 --> 00:24:38.460 align:start position:0%
and we do take the feedback that they
 
00:24:41.210 --> 00:24:41.220 align:start position:0%
say about the um you know what's
 
00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:43.080 align:start position:0%
happening in the schools and some of
 
00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:44.640 align:start position:0%
those things but one of the things that
 
00:24:46.669 --> 00:24:46.679 align:start position:0%
I noticed and this is me speaking for
 
00:24:49.370 --> 00:24:49.380 align:start position:0%
our program is about seven eight years
 
00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:52.440 align:start position:0%
ago we used to have a math like pre-map
 
00:24:54.289 --> 00:24:54.299 align:start position:0%
test to get into the first Math course
 
00:24:58.130 --> 00:24:58.140 align:start position:0%
for our LED and I noticed the number of
 
00:25:01.310 --> 00:25:01.320 align:start position:0%
our students that would fight and avoid
 
00:25:03.649 --> 00:25:03.659 align:start position:0%
taking it and delay it and cause them to
 
00:25:05.990 --> 00:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
bet you know either not do well or then
 
00:25:08.330 --> 00:25:08.340 align:start position:0%
be delayed in taking those math courses
 
00:25:10.430 --> 00:25:10.440 align:start position:0%
which would affect their progression so
 
00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
I met with the math department I talked
 
00:25:13.730 --> 00:25:13.740 align:start position:0%
to students about it and they're like oh
 
00:25:15.470 --> 00:25:15.480 align:start position:0%
I hate math I hate math I said you're an
 
00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
LED teacher you can't hate math we all
 
00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:20.400 align:start position:0%
love math but it created another barrier
 
00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:22.320 align:start position:0%
and so we met with the math department
 
00:25:25.730 --> 00:25:25.740 align:start position:0%
and we said this math test is causing uh
 
00:25:27.409 --> 00:25:27.419 align:start position:0%
you know students that come in with this
 
00:25:29.870 --> 00:25:29.880 align:start position:0%
negative view of math before they even
 
00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
engage so we removed that pre-mat test
 
00:25:35.810 --> 00:25:35.820 align:start position:0%
and so when our students come in now
 
00:25:38.210 --> 00:25:38.220 align:start position:0%
they go they can take the math 171 and
 
00:25:41.029 --> 00:25:41.039 align:start position:0%
math 172 and take it and it has changed
 
00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:43.260 align:start position:0%
the way our students see math they are
 
00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
now doing better in getting through the
 
00:25:47.090 --> 00:25:47.100 align:start position:0%
math and progressing in our program
 
00:25:48.890 --> 00:25:48.900 align:start position:0%
they're also
 
00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:51.480 align:start position:0%
um doing more successful in their
 
00:25:52.789 --> 00:25:52.799 align:start position:0%
attempts when it comes to taking the
 
00:25:55.070 --> 00:25:55.080 align:start position:0%
Praxis core in math and the practice two
 
00:25:57.049 --> 00:25:57.059 align:start position:0%
in math which wasn't before because now
 
00:25:59.210 --> 00:25:59.220 align:start position:0%
they don't have that barrier and then
 
00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:00.960 align:start position:0%
the last thing was they were doing the
 
00:26:02.990 --> 00:26:03.000 align:start position:0%
the successes of students in different
 
00:26:06.350 --> 00:26:06.360 align:start position:0%
various math courses our iql thing and
 
00:26:08.750 --> 00:26:08.760 align:start position:0%
they realized that our students that did
 
00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:11.580 align:start position:0%
this math 171 math 7172 a lot of
 
00:26:13.190 --> 00:26:13.200 align:start position:0%
students were not doing well in the
 
00:26:16.130 --> 00:26:16.140 align:start position:0%
psych research method like the site
 
00:26:18.289 --> 00:26:18.299 align:start position:0%
stats class that they had but they
 
00:26:19.610 --> 00:26:19.620 align:start position:0%
realized that the most successful
 
00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
students in those courses were the
 
00:26:23.269 --> 00:26:23.279 align:start position:0%
elementary ed students because they had
 
00:26:25.310 --> 00:26:25.320 align:start position:0%
the two math classes before and they
 
00:26:26.750 --> 00:26:26.760 align:start position:0%
ended up doing really well in that so
 
00:26:29.630 --> 00:26:29.640 align:start position:0%
our students have started to change it
 
00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
change the way that they see and they
 
00:26:34.730 --> 00:26:34.740 align:start position:0%
engage in math so and I think those are
 
00:26:36.590 --> 00:26:36.600 align:start position:0%
things that sometimes we have to realize
 
00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:37.490 align:start position:0%
things that sometimes we have to realize
that

00:26:37.490 --> 00:26:37.500 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:26:39.529 --> 00:26:39.539 align:start position:0%
the way we teach or the tests that we
 
00:26:42.529 --> 00:26:42.539 align:start position:0%
put on students create barriers to them
 
00:26:45.049 --> 00:26:45.059 align:start position:0%
um and uh so and I think that's where
 
00:26:47.029 --> 00:26:47.039 align:start position:0%
the feedback came into play and started
 
00:26:49.850 --> 00:26:49.860 align:start position:0%
changing the culture particular
 
00:26:52.669 --> 00:26:52.679 align:start position:0%
follow up on that and so so you've
 
00:26:54.649 --> 00:26:54.659 align:start position:0%
removed that barrier
 
00:26:57.649 --> 00:26:57.659 align:start position:0%
um um your um your your students in the
 
00:26:59.810 --> 00:26:59.820 align:start position:0%
in the teacher training programs have
 
00:27:03.169 --> 00:27:03.179 align:start position:0%
now now enter these math programs
 
00:27:06.409 --> 00:27:06.419 align:start position:0%
without sort of the anxiety of having to
 
00:27:08.830 --> 00:27:08.840 align:start position:0%
to take a high pressure test beforehand
 
00:27:11.450 --> 00:27:11.460 align:start position:0%
and and
 
00:27:15.130 --> 00:27:15.140 align:start position:0%
how has that then changed their
 
00:27:17.810 --> 00:27:17.820 align:start position:0%
attitudes towards or their their feeling
 
00:27:20.510 --> 00:27:20.520 align:start position:0%
towards math and how they project that
 
00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:21.950 align:start position:0%
towards math and how they project that
on

00:27:21.950 --> 00:27:21.960 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:22.990 align:start position:0%
on
um

00:27:22.990 --> 00:27:23.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:25.669 --> 00:27:25.679 align:start position:0%
they're young students that they that
 
00:27:27.529 --> 00:27:27.539 align:start position:0%
they eventually are in front of we have
 
00:27:29.990 --> 00:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
a lot less of students saying oh my God
 
00:27:31.370 --> 00:27:31.380 align:start position:0%
I don't want to do this math or I don't
 
00:27:33.049 --> 00:27:33.059 align:start position:0%
like this math and I will also say our
 
00:27:35.029 --> 00:27:35.039 align:start position:0%
math department has done a really good
 
00:27:37.250 --> 00:27:37.260 align:start position:0%
job that the people who teach it are
 
00:27:39.049 --> 00:27:39.059 align:start position:0%
either teachers themselves or in our
 
00:27:41.029 --> 00:27:41.039 align:start position:0%
secondary yet so they're really helping
 
00:27:42.890 --> 00:27:42.900 align:start position:0%
students enjoy and understand the
 
00:27:44.690 --> 00:27:44.700 align:start position:0%
concept so a lot of them actually leave
 
00:27:46.970 --> 00:27:46.980 align:start position:0%
the math class saying I actually
 
00:27:49.370 --> 00:27:49.380 align:start position:0%
understand this so it's really changed
 
00:27:52.730 --> 00:27:52.740 align:start position:0%
we see a lot less negativity towards
 
00:27:54.769 --> 00:27:54.779 align:start position:0%
math and I also remind students I was a
 
00:27:58.430 --> 00:27:58.440 align:start position:0%
special educator and I was somebody who
 
00:28:01.130 --> 00:28:01.140 align:start position:0%
I liked math I I was I got math but when
 
00:28:02.570 --> 00:28:02.580 align:start position:0%
I went to teach special ed in high
 
00:28:03.950 --> 00:28:03.960 align:start position:0%
school they said what do you want to
 
00:28:05.390 --> 00:28:05.400 align:start position:0%
teach and I didn't want to teach math
 
00:28:08.570 --> 00:28:08.580 align:start position:0%
because I understood math I wanted to
 
00:28:10.490 --> 00:28:10.500 align:start position:0%
teach the English because that is where
 
00:28:12.169 --> 00:28:12.179 align:start position:0%
students said well I didn't get this I'd
 
00:28:13.490 --> 00:28:13.500 align:start position:0%
be like oh I understand let's go through
 
00:28:15.830 --> 00:28:15.840 align:start position:0%
this let's break this down so I also try
 
00:28:17.269 --> 00:28:17.279 align:start position:0%
to remind the students sometimes what
 
00:28:18.830 --> 00:28:18.840 align:start position:0%
you think is a struggle becomes your
 
00:28:22.430 --> 00:28:22.440 align:start position:0%
superpower as a teacher and so we've
 
00:28:24.230 --> 00:28:24.240 align:start position:0%
changed the conversations that we have
 
00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
with students who are going into teacher
 
00:28:29.210 --> 00:28:29.220 align:start position:0%
Ed to change change that mindset and to
 
00:28:31.430 --> 00:28:31.440 align:start position:0%
really enjoy and realize that being an
 
00:28:34.130 --> 00:28:34.140 align:start position:0%
elementary a teacher specifically you
 
00:28:37.430 --> 00:28:37.440 align:start position:0%
have to enjoy and engage in all the
 
00:28:38.690 --> 00:28:38.700 align:start position:0%
content and I think that's one of the
 
00:28:40.070 --> 00:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
reasons that we switched to that
 
00:28:42.769 --> 00:28:42.779 align:start position:0%
integrated of really kind of allowing
 
00:28:44.450 --> 00:28:44.460 align:start position:0%
them to spend more time on that content
 
00:28:46.549 --> 00:28:46.559 align:start position:0%
and a concept and practicing and
 
00:28:48.590 --> 00:28:48.600 align:start position:0%
enjoying and being in the classroom for
 
00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:50.049 align:start position:0%
enjoying and being in the classroom for
that

00:28:50.049 --> 00:28:50.059 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:28:53.390 --> 00:28:53.400 align:start position:0%
a number of years ago and Shannon and
 
00:28:54.830 --> 00:28:54.840 align:start position:0%
Mark you might engage a little bit in
 
00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:55.970 align:start position:0%
Mark you might engage a little bit in
this

00:28:55.970 --> 00:28:55.980 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:28:58.190 --> 00:28:58.200 align:start position:0%
um we we heard from the community
 
00:29:00.769 --> 00:29:00.779 align:start position:0%
college system now this is going back to
 
00:29:03.289 --> 00:29:03.299 align:start position:0%
when uh Paul leather was Deputy
 
00:29:04.930 --> 00:29:04.940 align:start position:0%
Commissioner of Education
 
00:29:08.390 --> 00:29:08.400 align:start position:0%
that 60 of our kids coming out of high
 
00:29:10.190 --> 00:29:10.200 align:start position:0%
school going on to the community college
 
00:29:13.669 --> 00:29:13.679 align:start position:0%
system and I I never got that from the
 
00:29:15.049 --> 00:29:15.059 align:start position:0%
college presidents because they they
 
00:29:16.669 --> 00:29:16.679 align:start position:0%
said we don't have remedial call we we
 
00:29:18.470 --> 00:29:18.480 align:start position:0%
start right off right out of the gate
 
00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:20.760 align:start position:0%
but uh Shannon you were very honest
 
00:29:24.370 --> 00:29:24.380 align:start position:0%
saying that of those 60 percent uh
 
00:29:26.990 --> 00:29:27.000 align:start position:0%
requiring some kind of uh now we don't
 
00:29:28.549 --> 00:29:28.559 align:start position:0%
want to use the term remedial I know
 
00:29:30.950 --> 00:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
you've changed the game a little bit but
 
00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
of those 60 50 never graduated with an
 
00:29:38.510 --> 00:29:38.520 align:start position:0%
Associates due to the fact that the it
 
00:29:39.470 --> 00:29:39.480 align:start position:0%
was math
 
00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:42.480 align:start position:0%
and so evidently there we weren't
 
00:29:45.909 --> 00:29:45.919 align:start position:0%
sending students to higher ed
 
00:29:49.730 --> 00:29:49.740 align:start position:0%
well-prepared in that subject area and
 
00:29:52.730 --> 00:29:52.740 align:start position:0%
so you were having to do the job of
 
00:29:55.730 --> 00:29:55.740 align:start position:0%
maybe what perhaps K-12 should have been
 
00:29:55.740 --> 00:29:56.630 align:start position:0%
maybe what perhaps K-12 should have been
doing

00:29:56.630 --> 00:29:56.640 align:start position:0%
doing
 
00:29:58.970 --> 00:29:58.980 align:start position:0%
I mean we we could give data on that
 
00:30:00.649 --> 00:30:00.659 align:start position:0%
just our I mean to practice course
 
00:30:02.690 --> 00:30:02.700 align:start position:0%
scores like our students like we look at
 
00:30:04.789 --> 00:30:04.799 align:start position:0%
practice core score data which is
 
00:30:07.130 --> 00:30:07.140 align:start position:0%
basically a task based on 8th through
 
00:30:09.350 --> 00:30:09.360 align:start position:0%
10th grade yeah High School
 
00:30:11.930 --> 00:30:11.940 align:start position:0%
um and then students that are Pass rates
 
00:30:13.850 --> 00:30:13.860 align:start position:0%
like it takes students some students
 
00:30:15.649 --> 00:30:15.659 align:start position:0%
multiple times to pass this test you
 
00:30:17.690 --> 00:30:17.700 align:start position:0%
know this stuff that would be considered
 
00:30:19.850 --> 00:30:19.860 align:start position:0%
with medial workers things it's based on
 
00:30:21.110 --> 00:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
you know what should have already been
 
00:30:22.850 --> 00:30:22.860 align:start position:0%
taught what they should have had coming
 
00:30:22.860 --> 00:30:24.409 align:start position:0%
taught what they should have had coming
in

00:30:24.409 --> 00:30:24.419 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:30:28.070 --> 00:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
so how are we communicating that down to
 
00:30:30.110 --> 00:30:30.120 align:start position:0%
the high schools and to the local school
 
00:30:33.769 --> 00:30:33.779 align:start position:0%
districts that we're having this issue
 
00:30:35.690 --> 00:30:35.700 align:start position:0%
and I don't know where it whether it's
 
00:30:36.830 --> 00:30:36.840 align:start position:0%
getting better with what you're doing
 
00:30:40.970 --> 00:30:40.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:43.130 --> 00:30:43.140 align:start position:0%
um well as you know we have moved it
 
00:30:45.470 --> 00:30:45.480 align:start position:0%
from the kind of old old model of
 
00:30:47.330 --> 00:30:47.340 align:start position:0%
remedial education into what we call
 
00:30:49.850 --> 00:30:49.860 align:start position:0%
co-requisite remediation for Math and
 
00:30:51.289 --> 00:30:51.299 align:start position:0%
English where that's needed and that's
 
00:30:53.029 --> 00:30:53.039 align:start position:0%
putting the students directly into a
 
00:30:55.250 --> 00:30:55.260 align:start position:0%
college credit Math course but giving
 
00:30:57.830 --> 00:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
them specific supports they need in
 
00:30:59.930 --> 00:30:59.940 align:start position:0%
areas where they're not uh you know
 
00:31:02.149 --> 00:31:02.159 align:start position:0%
where they're maybe not prepared
 
00:31:05.330 --> 00:31:05.340 align:start position:0%
um and and that has that has improved
 
00:31:08.630 --> 00:31:08.640 align:start position:0%
their the outcomes for those students
 
00:31:10.730 --> 00:31:10.740 align:start position:0%
um in terms of the students that go on
 
00:31:13.310 --> 00:31:13.320 align:start position:0%
that that persist and go on to graduate
 
00:31:16.190 --> 00:31:16.200 align:start position:0%
so once they get to us that's that's
 
00:31:19.250 --> 00:31:19.260 align:start position:0%
what we're doing to kind of improve
 
00:31:21.889 --> 00:31:21.899 align:start position:0%
um and improve improve their outcomes
 
00:31:24.470 --> 00:31:24.480 align:start position:0%
as as you as you know we used to have a
 
00:31:25.490 --> 00:31:25.500 align:start position:0%
program called the math learning
 
00:31:27.049 --> 00:31:27.059 align:start position:0%
communities which was a partnership with
 
00:31:28.970 --> 00:31:28.980 align:start position:0%
the high schools that helped to embed
 
00:31:31.450 --> 00:31:31.460 align:start position:0%
the competencies within High School Math
 
00:31:34.010 --> 00:31:34.020 align:start position:0%
that would prepare students before they
 
00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:35.880 align:start position:0%
left high school for college level math
 
00:31:38.269 --> 00:31:38.279 align:start position:0%
and thanks to well there's funding
 
00:31:40.610 --> 00:31:40.620 align:start position:0%
currently in House Bill 2 now to revive
 
00:31:41.990 --> 00:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
that program
 
00:31:43.610 --> 00:31:43.620 align:start position:0%
which you know we certainly consider
 
00:31:45.110 --> 00:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
it's very promising numbers coming to
 
00:31:47.450 --> 00:31:47.460 align:start position:0%
you Shannon that you're still having
 
00:31:49.850 --> 00:31:49.860 align:start position:0%
these students coming from secondary
 
00:31:52.010 --> 00:31:52.020 align:start position:0%
education to you that need the
 
00:31:55.190 --> 00:31:55.200 align:start position:0%
co-requisite type instruction
 
00:31:57.889 --> 00:31:57.899 align:start position:0%
I I don't have the the numbers
 
00:31:59.570 --> 00:31:59.580 align:start position:0%
um off the top of my head but you know
 
00:32:00.950 --> 00:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
I'm sure there are still students coming
 
00:32:02.930 --> 00:32:02.940 align:start position:0%
to us that need that need that
 
00:32:08.169 --> 00:32:08.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:10.570 --> 00:32:10.580 align:start position:0%
Senator dalessandro
 
00:32:13.789 --> 00:32:13.799 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman a couple things
 
00:32:17.389 --> 00:32:17.399 align:start position:0%
with regard to your your robot what's
 
00:32:19.370 --> 00:32:19.380 align:start position:0%
the percentage of bid that are in the
 
00:32:19.380 --> 00:32:22.090 align:start position:0%
the percentage of bid that are in the
enrollment

00:32:22.090 --> 00:32:22.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:24.950 --> 00:32:24.960 align:start position:0%
it's gonna say I don't have that data
 
00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:26.450 align:start position:0%
it's gonna say I don't have that data
but

00:32:26.450 --> 00:32:26.460 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:32:28.430 --> 00:32:28.440 align:start position:0%
um it's more balanced in our secondary
 
00:32:32.149 --> 00:32:32.159 align:start position:0%
okay you know our music and our PE our
 
00:32:34.789 --> 00:32:34.799 align:start position:0%
elementary still is predominantly female
 
00:32:37.909 --> 00:32:37.919 align:start position:0%
but we are getting more males that are
 
00:32:40.610 --> 00:32:40.620 align:start position:0%
coming into Elementary education so and
 
00:32:43.789 --> 00:32:43.799 align:start position:0%
when they do come we're like please
 
00:32:45.769 --> 00:32:45.779 align:start position:0%
um so I mean I don't have the exact
 
00:32:47.690 --> 00:32:47.700 align:start position:0%
numbers but it's still consistent I
 
00:32:49.970 --> 00:32:49.980 align:start position:0%
don't know the same for you same thing
 
00:32:52.789 --> 00:32:52.799 align:start position:0%
um we have we see more men in social
 
00:32:55.370 --> 00:32:55.380 align:start position:0%
studies in physical education health
 
00:32:58.010 --> 00:32:58.020 align:start position:0%
education less so although even this
 
00:33:00.830 --> 00:33:00.840 align:start position:0%
year's cohort you know I think out of 30
 
00:33:04.250 --> 00:33:04.260 align:start position:0%
something we have five males there so
 
00:33:07.430 --> 00:33:07.440 align:start position:0%
um and we always try to not to because I
 
00:33:09.289 --> 00:33:09.299 align:start position:0%
was a male Elementary School teacher too
 
00:33:09.299 --> 00:33:10.310 align:start position:0%
was a male Elementary School teacher too
so

00:33:10.310 --> 00:33:10.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:33:12.049 --> 00:33:12.059 align:start position:0%
um but you know we do try to pair them
 
00:33:13.789 --> 00:33:13.799 align:start position:0%
up with other male you know we try to
 
00:33:15.710 --> 00:33:15.720 align:start position:0%
support that and try to encourage that
 
00:33:17.029 --> 00:33:17.039 align:start position:0%
as much as possible because I think it's
 
00:33:18.649 --> 00:33:18.659 align:start position:0%
really important to have
 
00:33:21.049 --> 00:33:21.059 align:start position:0%
um as much as possible
 
00:33:21.059 --> 00:33:21.830 align:start position:0%
um as much as possible
um

00:33:21.830 --> 00:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:24.289 --> 00:33:24.299 align:start position:0%
for the first question
 
00:33:24.299 --> 00:33:25.450 align:start position:0%
for the first question
sorry

00:33:25.450 --> 00:33:25.460 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
00:33:28.549 --> 00:33:28.559 align:start position:0%
in the past keyed state has had an
 
00:33:30.350 --> 00:33:30.360 align:start position:0%
association with the parking Verde
 
00:33:33.230 --> 00:33:33.240 align:start position:0%
school I represent that area
 
00:33:37.310 --> 00:33:37.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:39.289 --> 00:33:39.299 align:start position:0%
um well we have different levels of
 
00:33:41.509 --> 00:33:41.519 align:start position:0%
partnership so usually
 
00:33:43.009 --> 00:33:43.019 align:start position:0%
the partnership schools we have
 
00:33:45.049 --> 00:33:45.059 align:start position:0%
presently and this is especially I said
 
00:33:47.210 --> 00:33:47.220 align:start position:0%
right before like around covid a lot of
 
00:33:48.230 --> 00:33:48.240 align:start position:0%
the partnership schools are in the
 
00:33:50.690 --> 00:33:50.700 align:start position:0%
Monadnock region but we do do a lot of
 
00:33:52.130 --> 00:33:52.140 align:start position:0%
Outreach especially with our students
 
00:33:53.870 --> 00:33:53.880 align:start position:0%
and student teaching if some of them
 
00:33:56.149 --> 00:33:56.159 align:start position:0%
need to we have had students in the
 
00:33:58.009 --> 00:33:58.019 align:start position:0%
Manchester area that we've had in
 
00:34:00.950 --> 00:34:00.960 align:start position:0%
Londonderry we've had up to Concord a
 
00:34:03.049 --> 00:34:03.059 align:start position:0%
lot of times it's but but we base it on
 
00:34:04.850 --> 00:34:04.860 align:start position:0%
supporting the student if they need to
 
00:34:07.009 --> 00:34:07.019 align:start position:0%
live at home and then our faculty will
 
00:34:09.470 --> 00:34:09.480 align:start position:0%
travel to do the observations at those
 
00:34:11.570 --> 00:34:11.580 align:start position:0%
schools I do know that Steve bagai does
 
00:34:14.149 --> 00:34:14.159 align:start position:0%
a lot of um out we reach and partnership
 
00:34:17.930 --> 00:34:17.940 align:start position:0%
work he's our grad coordinator in the
 
00:34:19.129 --> 00:34:19.139 align:start position:0%
Varney School and some of those in
 
00:34:21.829 --> 00:34:21.839 align:start position:0%
Manchester okay yeah do you have
 
00:34:24.050 --> 00:34:24.060 align:start position:0%
anything with us Yes actually you have a
 
00:34:25.490 --> 00:34:25.500 align:start position:0%
wonderful partnership with Northwest
 
00:34:27.230 --> 00:34:27.240 align:start position:0%
Elementary School
 
00:34:29.149 --> 00:34:29.159 align:start position:0%
um Shelley the principality is fantastic
 
00:34:31.849 --> 00:34:31.859 align:start position:0%
and it varies how many interns we have
 
00:34:33.710 --> 00:34:33.720 align:start position:0%
there or clinical experiences but we've
 
00:34:35.930 --> 00:34:35.940 align:start position:0%
been working with them uh probably for
 
00:34:38.270 --> 00:34:38.280 align:start position:0%
the past five years now and it's been a
 
00:34:39.950 --> 00:34:39.960 align:start position:0%
great experience for our students in the
 
00:34:42.169 --> 00:34:42.179 align:start position:0%
school and also working with that school
 
00:34:44.810 --> 00:34:44.820 align:start position:0%
Northwest is a very successful school
 
00:34:46.669 --> 00:34:46.679 align:start position:0%
I'll be duplex was the principal there
 
00:34:49.129 --> 00:34:49.139 align:start position:0%
he was one of my students when he was in
 
00:34:52.270 --> 00:34:52.280 align:start position:0%
high school and one for the I have eight
 
00:34:55.070 --> 00:34:55.080 align:start position:0%
minority schools in the district and I
 
00:34:58.609 --> 00:34:58.619 align:start position:0%
represent Hispanic and black represent
 
00:35:00.410 --> 00:35:00.420 align:start position:0%
the majority of students of those
 
00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:01.370 align:start position:0%
the majority of students of those
schools

00:35:01.370 --> 00:35:01.380 align:start position:0%
schools
 
00:35:04.130 --> 00:35:04.140 align:start position:0%
how how do you face that in terms of
 
00:35:06.349 --> 00:35:06.359 align:start position:0%
your preparation knowing knowing that
 
00:35:10.730 --> 00:35:10.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:12.720 align:start position:0%
um I think we tried to what we try to do
 
00:35:14.329 --> 00:35:14.339 align:start position:0%
is give our students a wide range of
 
00:35:16.010 --> 00:35:16.020 align:start position:0%
field experiences which is why they
 
00:35:18.470 --> 00:35:18.480 align:start position:0%
started so early so we have
 
00:35:20.569 --> 00:35:20.579 align:start position:0%
um Manchester we don't work as much in
 
00:35:22.370 --> 00:35:22.380 align:start position:0%
Manchester because it's over an hour for
 
00:35:23.690 --> 00:35:23.700 align:start position:0%
a student to get there and
 
00:35:25.730 --> 00:35:25.740 align:start position:0%
transportation issues are improved with
 
00:35:26.810 --> 00:35:26.820 align:start position:0%
the challenge
 
00:35:28.490 --> 00:35:28.500 align:start position:0%
um with that but what we've tried to do
 
00:35:31.370 --> 00:35:31.380 align:start position:0%
is that we try to prepare our students
 
00:35:33.890 --> 00:35:33.900 align:start position:0%
you know we work in in a wide range we
 
00:35:35.030 --> 00:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
work in the Franklin School District
 
00:35:37.310 --> 00:35:37.320 align:start position:0%
which is has been some challenges we
 
00:35:39.230 --> 00:35:39.240 align:start position:0%
work with Laconia we work right in our
 
00:35:42.349 --> 00:35:42.359 align:start position:0%
backyard SAU 48 and our goal is to have
 
00:35:44.270 --> 00:35:44.280 align:start position:0%
students work in a variety of different
 
00:35:46.370 --> 00:35:46.380 align:start position:0%
environments to help prepare them using
 
00:35:48.589 --> 00:35:48.599 align:start position:0%
embed in those clinical experiences and
 
00:35:50.630 --> 00:35:50.640 align:start position:0%
then tying them together
 
00:35:52.069 --> 00:35:52.079 align:start position:0%
um with what they do in the coursework
 
00:35:54.589 --> 00:35:54.599 align:start position:0%
our faculty members spend time at
 
00:35:56.329 --> 00:35:56.339 align:start position:0%
schools as well and I think what we're
 
00:35:57.890 --> 00:35:57.900 align:start position:0%
really trying to do you know some of the
 
00:36:00.050 --> 00:36:00.060 align:start position:0%
earlier questions I heard was we want
 
00:36:01.790 --> 00:36:01.800 align:start position:0%
there to be that connection to what
 
00:36:03.530 --> 00:36:03.540 align:start position:0%
they're happening happening in schools
 
00:36:06.109 --> 00:36:06.119 align:start position:0%
is connected to what they are preparing
 
00:36:07.510 --> 00:36:07.520 align:start position:0%
in that coursework
 
00:36:10.550 --> 00:36:10.560 align:start position:0%
and I would say for us that
 
00:36:12.710 --> 00:36:12.720 align:start position:0%
we do give multiple experiences and
 
00:36:14.569 --> 00:36:14.579 align:start position:0%
we're very cognizant of grade levels and
 
00:36:16.250 --> 00:36:16.260 align:start position:0%
experiences Middle High School to give a
 
00:36:18.470 --> 00:36:18.480 align:start position:0%
variety but Monadnock region doesn't
 
00:36:21.290 --> 00:36:21.300 align:start position:0%
have the same level of diversity but if
 
00:36:22.849 --> 00:36:22.859 align:start position:0%
it was up to me I keep joking with the
 
00:36:24.230 --> 00:36:24.240 align:start position:0%
school I said I would love to get a bus
 
00:36:26.329 --> 00:36:26.339 align:start position:0%
and train someone to be a bus driver so
 
00:36:28.190 --> 00:36:28.200 align:start position:0%
our students could make those
 
00:36:30.230 --> 00:36:30.240 align:start position:0%
connections and experiences and if we
 
00:36:31.730 --> 00:36:31.740 align:start position:0%
have students at the student teaching
 
00:36:33.410 --> 00:36:33.420 align:start position:0%
who want to be placed in some of those
 
00:36:35.450 --> 00:36:35.460 align:start position:0%
schools we we happily support those
 
00:36:38.329 --> 00:36:38.339 align:start position:0%
Endeavors we did get a couple of um we
 
00:36:40.910 --> 00:36:40.920 align:start position:0%
are just in the midst of a search we had
 
00:36:42.650 --> 00:36:42.660 align:start position:0%
a donor a couple years ago that wanted
 
00:36:45.050 --> 00:36:45.060 align:start position:0%
to bring some more urban experience into
 
00:36:47.390 --> 00:36:47.400 align:start position:0%
for Keene State so we've been searching
 
00:36:49.490 --> 00:36:49.500 align:start position:0%
for a candidate that can come for two
 
00:36:51.650 --> 00:36:51.660 align:start position:0%
years that will bring recent Urban
 
00:36:54.829 --> 00:36:54.839 align:start position:0%
experience and to Keene State College to
 
00:36:57.230 --> 00:36:57.240 align:start position:0%
bring that to all of our students but
 
00:36:58.550 --> 00:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
also in hopes that it will make
 
00:37:01.069 --> 00:37:01.079 align:start position:0%
connections so our students can start
 
00:37:03.650 --> 00:37:03.660 align:start position:0%
going and spending time in some other
 
00:37:06.410 --> 00:37:06.420 align:start position:0%
schools in the region as well my last
 
00:37:07.670 --> 00:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
question is
 
00:37:11.030 --> 00:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
we now have social workers in our
 
00:37:13.010 --> 00:37:13.020 align:start position:0%
elementary schools but particularly
 
00:37:16.150 --> 00:37:16.160 align:start position:0%
Northwest which is uh as you know
 
00:37:19.970 --> 00:37:19.980 align:start position:0%
there's great variety of Northwest pack
 
00:37:21.470 --> 00:37:21.480 align:start position:0%
of early gosh so you go right through
 
00:37:22.790 --> 00:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
the situation
 
00:37:27.530 --> 00:37:27.540 align:start position:0%
it um these social workers are very busy
 
00:37:30.530 --> 00:37:30.540 align:start position:0%
it that that the poor classroom teacher
 
00:37:33.530 --> 00:37:33.540 align:start position:0%
has to deal with with these situations
 
00:37:37.069 --> 00:37:37.079 align:start position:0%
and our kids are 80 sometimes 90 free
 
00:37:38.930 --> 00:37:38.940 align:start position:0%
reduced my solution you know the
 
00:37:41.750 --> 00:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
economic environment they're coming from
 
00:37:44.089 --> 00:37:44.099 align:start position:0%
how do you how do your people handle
 
00:37:46.250 --> 00:37:46.260 align:start position:0%
that kind of a situation
 
00:37:48.170 --> 00:37:48.180 align:start position:0%
you how do you prep a foreign in other
 
00:37:50.030 --> 00:37:50.040 align:start position:0%
words well it's
 
00:37:52.670 --> 00:37:52.680 align:start position:0%
it's interesting because we have schools
 
00:37:54.589 --> 00:37:54.599 align:start position:0%
in Keene one of the elementary schools
 
00:37:57.710 --> 00:37:57.720 align:start position:0%
has over 82 of them over 80 percent
 
00:38:00.530 --> 00:38:00.540 align:start position:0%
um low SES pre-reduced lunch so some of
 
00:38:02.690 --> 00:38:02.700 align:start position:0%
the the especially the economic um
 
00:38:05.089 --> 00:38:05.099 align:start position:0%
diversity is relevant we also have
 
00:38:07.910 --> 00:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
students and our one of our methods one
 
00:38:10.250 --> 00:38:10.260 align:start position:0%
Partnerships is with Hinsdale and I
 
00:38:11.630 --> 00:38:11.640 align:start position:0%
don't know if you know Hinsdale but it's
 
00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:12.670 align:start position:0%
don't know if you know Hinsdale but it's
rural

00:38:12.670 --> 00:38:12.680 align:start position:0%
rural
 
00:38:15.109 --> 00:38:15.119 align:start position:0%
yeah that's right and so they're going
 
00:38:16.910 --> 00:38:16.920 align:start position:0%
into the the other it's like you know
 
00:38:18.950 --> 00:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
what you it's like the complete opposite
 
00:38:22.030 --> 00:38:22.040 align:start position:0%
but it has a lot of this like low SES
 
00:38:25.010 --> 00:38:25.020 align:start position:0%
Transportation some of those so the part
 
00:38:27.109 --> 00:38:27.119 align:start position:0%
of our job is to not only just put them
 
00:38:28.670 --> 00:38:28.680 align:start position:0%
in the schools and I'm sure I know you
 
00:38:31.010 --> 00:38:31.020 align:start position:0%
do this as well is that we really think
 
00:38:32.270 --> 00:38:32.280 align:start position:0%
it's important that our students
 
00:38:34.790 --> 00:38:34.800 align:start position:0%
understand the community that they're
 
00:38:36.589 --> 00:38:36.599 align:start position:0%
working with and all the things that are
 
00:38:39.050 --> 00:38:39.060 align:start position:0%
coming into it and then by having two
 
00:38:40.670 --> 00:38:40.680 align:start position:0%
different so we might have a methods one
 
00:38:43.370 --> 00:38:43.380 align:start position:0%
in Hinsdale and methods two the students
 
00:38:45.710 --> 00:38:45.720 align:start position:0%
might be up in Keene which is a very
 
00:38:48.170 --> 00:38:48.180 align:start position:0%
different Dynamic uh financial support
 
00:38:50.990 --> 00:38:51.000 align:start position:0%
by schools SAU structure all those
 
00:38:52.250 --> 00:38:52.260 align:start position:0%
things are very different for the
 
00:38:54.530 --> 00:38:54.540 align:start position:0%
students to to kind of tease an
 
00:38:54.540 --> 00:38:57.470 align:start position:0%
students to to kind of tease an
experience

00:38:57.470 --> 00:38:57.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:59.410 --> 00:38:59.420 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
00:39:03.109 --> 00:39:03.119 align:start position:0%
yeah as a follow-up does Lou's question
 
00:39:05.630 --> 00:39:05.640 align:start position:0%
what's the diversity makeup of your
 
00:39:08.150 --> 00:39:08.160 align:start position:0%
student population who are becoming
 
00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:11.329 align:start position:0%
student population who are becoming
teachers

00:39:11.329 --> 00:39:11.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:11.339 --> 00:39:13.849 align:start position:0%
 
say

00:39:13.849 --> 00:39:13.859 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:39:16.250 --> 00:39:16.260 align:start position:0%
University is the fact that we can say
 
00:39:18.290 --> 00:39:18.300 align:start position:0%
it's been for a long time over 40
 
00:39:20.329 --> 00:39:20.339 align:start position:0%
percent uh first generation college
 
00:39:22.490 --> 00:39:22.500 align:start position:0%
students so we have a lot of students
 
00:39:24.530 --> 00:39:24.540 align:start position:0%
that they are the first and navigating
 
00:39:27.349 --> 00:39:27.359 align:start position:0%
that piece we also and these aren't all
 
00:39:27.359 --> 00:39:28.550 align:start position:0%
that piece we also and these aren't all
documented

00:39:28.550 --> 00:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
documented
 
00:39:30.290 --> 00:39:30.300 align:start position:0%
um you know they don't always like to go
 
00:39:32.030 --> 00:39:32.040 align:start position:0%
to the office and disabilities but we
 
00:39:34.250 --> 00:39:34.260 align:start position:0%
tend to have over 40 percent of students
 
00:39:36.109 --> 00:39:36.119 align:start position:0%
that have disabilities also come to
 
00:39:38.569 --> 00:39:38.579 align:start position:0%
Keene State so we do have a lot of
 
00:39:40.910 --> 00:39:40.920 align:start position:0%
diversity and there's if you come and
 
00:39:42.829 --> 00:39:42.839 align:start position:0%
actually I don't have the demographics
 
00:39:44.690 --> 00:39:44.700 align:start position:0%
but if you went on our website I know
 
00:39:47.329 --> 00:39:47.339 align:start position:0%
our Factbook that was presented they
 
00:39:49.550 --> 00:39:49.560 align:start position:0%
have been doing a lot more Outreach to
 
00:39:51.790 --> 00:39:51.800 align:start position:0%
bring more diversity to Keene State
 
00:39:54.410 --> 00:39:54.420 align:start position:0%
because it is needed to represent what
 
00:39:57.170 --> 00:39:57.180 align:start position:0%
is beyond just the Monadnock region so
 
00:40:00.050 --> 00:40:00.060 align:start position:0%
and with that we are very active and I
 
00:40:02.450 --> 00:40:02.460 align:start position:0%
know I'm speaking I'm saying me but I
 
00:40:05.210 --> 00:40:05.220 align:start position:0%
know we do it you do the same thing that
 
00:40:08.750 --> 00:40:08.760 align:start position:0%
is why faculty we're always there on
 
00:40:10.910 --> 00:40:10.920 align:start position:0%
um you know open house things admitted
 
00:40:13.010 --> 00:40:13.020 align:start position:0%
student days when students come to tour
 
00:40:15.230 --> 00:40:15.240 align:start position:0%
because that that is a way to kind of
 
00:40:17.690 --> 00:40:17.700 align:start position:0%
expand that diversity when families come
 
00:40:23.630 --> 00:40:23.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:25.490 --> 00:40:25.500 align:start position:0%
what you just commented on but I think
 
00:40:28.069 --> 00:40:28.079 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day of our students
 
00:40:29.210 --> 00:40:29.220 align:start position:0%
who have been preparing to become
 
00:40:30.710 --> 00:40:30.720 align:start position:0%
teachers would probably identify as
 
00:40:33.530 --> 00:40:33.540 align:start position:0%
white or Caucasian yeah very high
 
00:40:36.589 --> 00:40:36.599 align:start position:0%
numbers yeah on that I think it's
 
00:40:39.290 --> 00:40:39.300 align:start position:0%
important to note that because
 
00:40:42.349 --> 00:40:42.359 align:start position:0%
our students our population is becoming
 
00:40:45.290 --> 00:40:45.300 align:start position:0%
much more diverse and it's not just in
 
00:40:48.170 --> 00:40:48.180 align:start position:0%
Manchester or Nashua and so that would
 
00:40:50.630 --> 00:40:50.640 align:start position:0%
be a concern that I have and I I deal
 
00:40:55.370 --> 00:40:55.380 align:start position:0%
with City year in Manchester and they
 
00:40:58.310 --> 00:40:58.320 align:start position:0%
have a very diverse Corps member and the
 
00:41:00.349 --> 00:41:00.359 align:start position:0%
superintendent there's always trying to
 
00:41:03.349 --> 00:41:03.359 align:start position:0%
hire some of those students after they
 
00:41:05.329 --> 00:41:05.339 align:start position:0%
finish their core experience to be
 
00:41:07.190 --> 00:41:07.200 align:start position:0%
teachers there in Manchester so I would
 
00:41:09.530 --> 00:41:09.540 align:start position:0%
just encourage you to do whatever you
 
00:41:13.730 --> 00:41:13.740 align:start position:0%
can to have a greater diversity from a
 
00:41:15.950 --> 00:41:15.960 align:start position:0%
minority standpoint in your student
 
00:41:17.930 --> 00:41:17.940 align:start position:0%
population because we need those and
 
00:41:21.349 --> 00:41:21.359 align:start position:0%
kids need to see those people who look
 
00:41:25.550 --> 00:41:25.560 align:start position:0%
like them teaching them we agree I'd
 
00:41:28.069 --> 00:41:28.079 align:start position:0%
like to get onto just a little slightly
 
00:41:30.349 --> 00:41:30.359 align:start position:0%
different topic when we had a bill in
 
00:41:34.430 --> 00:41:34.440 align:start position:0%
here the other day in its SB 216. we
 
00:41:36.530 --> 00:41:36.540 align:start position:0%
were talking about Civics education and
 
00:41:38.569 --> 00:41:38.579 align:start position:0%
we got in the other areas of the social
 
00:41:41.569 --> 00:41:41.579 align:start position:0%
studies as well and one of the questions
 
00:41:43.790 --> 00:41:43.800 align:start position:0%
which was asked and this happened to be
 
00:41:46.310 --> 00:41:46.320 align:start position:0%
asked of Megan Tuttle who is the
 
00:41:49.910 --> 00:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
president of Nea and her children in
 
00:41:52.550 --> 00:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
fact are in public school right now and
 
00:41:54.650 --> 00:41:54.660 align:start position:0%
we're talking about what do we usually
 
00:41:56.390 --> 00:41:56.400 align:start position:0%
do in social studies at the fourth grade
 
00:41:58.069 --> 00:41:58.079 align:start position:0%
level in this state
 
00:42:00.230 --> 00:42:00.240 align:start position:0%
I know in May and I it was always main
 
00:42:00.240 --> 00:42:01.310 align:start position:0%
I know in May and I it was always main
studies

00:42:01.310 --> 00:42:01.320 align:start position:0%
studies
 
00:42:03.530 --> 00:42:03.540 align:start position:0%
and here it's New Hampshire studies as
 
00:42:06.950 --> 00:42:06.960 align:start position:0%
well and but what Megan said to me was
 
00:42:09.730 --> 00:42:09.740 align:start position:0%
kind of you know it didn't surprise me
 
00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:12.720 align:start position:0%
it was that well their their New
 
00:42:14.030 --> 00:42:14.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire studies program is probably
 
00:42:15.829 --> 00:42:15.839 align:start position:0%
going to be the visit to the Capitol
 
00:42:19.069 --> 00:42:19.079 align:start position:0%
Building period that's it
 
00:42:23.089 --> 00:42:23.099 align:start position:0%
no more now and no less that's it
 
00:42:25.430 --> 00:42:25.440 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm really a little bit concerned
 
00:42:27.530 --> 00:42:27.540 align:start position:0%
now and another thing that came up in
 
00:42:30.349 --> 00:42:30.359 align:start position:0%
that conversation was that we're
 
00:42:32.210 --> 00:42:32.220 align:start position:0%
assessing on the Statewide assessment
 
00:42:35.150 --> 00:42:35.160 align:start position:0%
Reading Writing mathematics language
 
00:42:38.750 --> 00:42:38.760 align:start position:0%
arts area and science not every year
 
00:42:41.990 --> 00:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
social studies is not assessed at all
 
00:42:45.230 --> 00:42:45.240 align:start position:0%
so I guess one way of saying what takes
 
00:42:47.450 --> 00:42:47.460 align:start position:0%
the back seat in the car
 
00:42:49.130 --> 00:42:49.140 align:start position:0%
um you're not going to be measured on
 
00:42:51.290 --> 00:42:51.300 align:start position:0%
this subject uh you're not going to be
 
00:42:53.569 --> 00:42:53.579 align:start position:0%
held accountable for this subject what
 
00:42:56.030 --> 00:42:56.040 align:start position:0%
do we do to ensure that
 
00:42:57.710 --> 00:42:57.720 align:start position:0%
um and I'm getting slightly into this
 
00:43:00.650 --> 00:43:00.660 align:start position:0%
area of social studies what can I do to
 
00:43:04.609 --> 00:43:04.619 align:start position:0%
ensure that it's taught and I I know
 
00:43:07.430 --> 00:43:07.440 align:start position:0%
that your their your higher education
 
00:43:10.849 --> 00:43:10.859 align:start position:0%
and are you so from the teacher prep
 
00:43:14.150 --> 00:43:14.160 align:start position:0%
side are you teaching and and teaching
 
00:43:17.089 --> 00:43:17.099 align:start position:0%
that content about New Hampshire uh
 
00:43:19.250 --> 00:43:19.260 align:start position:0%
about our Civics about our you know our
 
00:43:21.170 --> 00:43:21.180 align:start position:0%
geography Etc
 
00:43:23.390 --> 00:43:23.400 align:start position:0%
um and you mentioned earlier that the
 
00:43:25.849 --> 00:43:25.859 align:start position:0%
you know there's a number if you're k
 
00:43:27.230 --> 00:43:27.240 align:start position:0%
through eight you have to number other
 
00:43:30.290 --> 00:43:30.300 align:start position:0%
credits subject areas
 
00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:31.730 align:start position:0%
credits subject areas
um

00:43:31.730 --> 00:43:31.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:36.290 --> 00:43:36.300 align:start position:0%
I I'm I'm just concerned that are we are
 
00:43:39.470 --> 00:43:39.480 align:start position:0%
we employing teachers that have the
 
00:43:41.510 --> 00:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
I know they're coming back in in their
 
00:43:43.910 --> 00:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
in the in education and they're finding
 
00:43:47.329 --> 00:43:47.339 align:start position:0%
that there's this this there's this book
 
00:43:49.190 --> 00:43:49.200 align:start position:0%
that says here's our curriculum if they
 
00:43:52.130 --> 00:43:52.140 align:start position:0%
even have a book anymore and and uh
 
00:43:54.050 --> 00:43:54.060 align:start position:0%
that's it it's already established so
 
00:43:55.250 --> 00:43:55.260 align:start position:0%
you have to teach and I also understand
 
00:43:57.050 --> 00:43:57.060 align:start position:0%
all the other issues we have a lot of
 
00:43:59.510 --> 00:43:59.520 align:start position:0%
mental health issues going on a lot of
 
00:44:01.010 --> 00:44:01.020 align:start position:0%
time being absorbed it's got to come
 
00:44:02.990 --> 00:44:03.000 align:start position:0%
from something at school day five and a
 
00:44:05.329 --> 00:44:05.339 align:start position:0%
half hours of instructions that's it at
 
00:44:07.370 --> 00:44:07.380 align:start position:0%
Max you have recesses in there too and
 
00:44:08.930 --> 00:44:08.940 align:start position:0%
others so
 
00:44:11.930 --> 00:44:11.940 align:start position:0%
um where should we go you know when we
 
00:44:17.930 --> 00:44:17.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:21.530 --> 00:44:21.540 align:start position:0%
I don't know I'll just share anecdotally
 
00:44:21.540 --> 00:44:22.250 align:start position:0%
I don't know I'll just share anecdotally
um

00:44:22.250 --> 00:44:22.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:24.770 --> 00:44:24.780 align:start position:0%
we find so in preparing our teachers to
 
00:44:27.170 --> 00:44:27.180 align:start position:0%
be k-6 teachers or Ka in their
 
00:44:29.569 --> 00:44:29.579 align:start position:0%
internship placements and the clinical
 
00:44:32.270 --> 00:44:32.280 align:start position:0%
placements I would just concur with you
 
00:44:34.190 --> 00:44:34.200 align:start position:0%
that our students have fewer
 
00:44:35.930 --> 00:44:35.940 align:start position:0%
opportunities to teach science and
 
00:44:37.870 --> 00:44:37.880 align:start position:0%
social studies in those classrooms
 
00:44:39.950 --> 00:44:39.960 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I think you're right is
 
00:44:41.690 --> 00:44:41.700 align:start position:0%
that a lot of school schools that I
 
00:44:43.849 --> 00:44:43.859 align:start position:0%
visited and spend time with and not but
 
00:44:47.030 --> 00:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
you see more schools pushing
 
00:44:49.670 --> 00:44:49.680 align:start position:0%
um reading pushing math extended times
 
00:44:52.790 --> 00:44:52.800 align:start position:0%
at the expense of social studies and or
 
00:44:54.950 --> 00:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
science being taught this is anecdotally
 
00:44:57.170 --> 00:44:57.180 align:start position:0%
but so I don't have an answer for you
 
00:44:58.910 --> 00:44:58.920 align:start position:0%
but just to say I think what then though
 
00:45:00.530 --> 00:45:00.540 align:start position:0%
in terms of our team you know even the
 
00:45:02.569 --> 00:45:02.579 align:start position:0%
students as we prepare them
 
00:45:05.329 --> 00:45:05.339 align:start position:0%
we're a big believer that the clinical I
 
00:45:07.550 --> 00:45:07.560 align:start position:0%
think like anything by practicing is how
 
00:45:08.990 --> 00:45:09.000 align:start position:0%
you get better right but if you have
 
00:45:10.609 --> 00:45:10.619 align:start position:0%
fewer opportunities because you see it
 
00:45:12.770 --> 00:45:12.780 align:start position:0%
you know less so I think it is something
 
00:45:12.780 --> 00:45:13.790 align:start position:0%
you know less so I think it is something
that

00:45:13.790 --> 00:45:13.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:14.390 align:start position:0%
that
um

00:45:14.390 --> 00:45:14.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:16.250 --> 00:45:16.260 align:start position:0%
I don't have the magic answer to it but
 
00:45:18.950 --> 00:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
it definitely we've seen that yeah
 
00:45:21.470 --> 00:45:21.480 align:start position:0%
um and anecdotally it's it's interesting
 
00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:22.309 align:start position:0%
um and anecdotally it's it's interesting
because

00:45:22.309 --> 00:45:22.319 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:45:24.890 --> 00:45:24.900 align:start position:0%
and and Keenan I can speak for Keen my
 
00:45:27.650 --> 00:45:27.660 align:start position:0%
children participated in um third grade
 
00:45:31.490 --> 00:45:31.500 align:start position:0%
they do a lot with um the the keen and
 
00:45:33.470 --> 00:45:33.480 align:start position:0%
they have a day where all and I get to
 
00:45:35.569 --> 00:45:35.579 align:start position:0%
see it outside my office where all the
 
00:45:37.069 --> 00:45:37.079 align:start position:0%
third grades are visiting and they're
 
00:45:38.930 --> 00:45:38.940 align:start position:0%
walking around downtown they're visiting
 
00:45:40.550 --> 00:45:40.560 align:start position:0%
Wyman way and they're going here and
 
00:45:42.230 --> 00:45:42.240 align:start position:0%
there they come have lunch in the dining
 
00:45:44.750 --> 00:45:44.760 align:start position:0%
hall and so they have it and you see it
 
00:45:46.550 --> 00:45:46.560 align:start position:0%
and the students are enriched with it
 
00:45:48.290 --> 00:45:48.300 align:start position:0%
and it was interesting I was talking to
 
00:45:50.569 --> 00:45:50.579 align:start position:0%
a teacher uh last year and I said if you
 
00:45:52.190 --> 00:45:52.200 align:start position:0%
need help we have students they will
 
00:45:53.930 --> 00:45:53.940 align:start position:0%
happily walk so we're talking about
 
00:45:56.270 --> 00:45:56.280 align:start position:0%
plans of getting our students to help
 
00:45:58.130 --> 00:45:58.140 align:start position:0%
support that and to have you know then
 
00:46:00.770 --> 00:46:00.780 align:start position:0%
they get to experience it as well and
 
00:46:03.230 --> 00:46:03.240 align:start position:0%
and on the other side of it I have a son
 
00:46:05.569 --> 00:46:05.579 align:start position:0%
in ninth grade right now and he's taking
 
00:46:08.150 --> 00:46:08.160 align:start position:0%
a street Law class right at the high
 
00:46:10.430 --> 00:46:10.440 align:start position:0%
school and at first I was you know as an
 
00:46:13.190 --> 00:46:13.200 align:start position:0%
elective and he is loving it and the
 
00:46:15.470 --> 00:46:15.480 align:start position:0%
things that he is learning so I think
 
00:46:17.210 --> 00:46:17.220 align:start position:0%
that there's opportunities and I think
 
00:46:19.849 --> 00:46:19.859 align:start position:0%
there's want but I think the stress of
 
00:46:22.370 --> 00:46:22.380 align:start position:0%
trying you know this the test testing
 
00:46:23.990 --> 00:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
you have to meet this in literacy and
 
00:46:25.670 --> 00:46:25.680 align:start position:0%
this is math and this is your school is
 
00:46:27.890 --> 00:46:27.900 align:start position:0%
going to be judged and you it puts a
 
00:46:29.510 --> 00:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
stress that causes science and social
 
00:46:31.849 --> 00:46:31.859 align:start position:0%
safety be pushed on the side but if you
 
00:46:33.170 --> 00:46:33.180 align:start position:0%
think about it and I was reading through
 
00:46:34.250 --> 00:46:34.260 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:46:36.349 --> 00:46:36.359 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of ways that we can
 
00:46:39.050 --> 00:46:39.060 align:start position:0%
include even the Civic and education
 
00:46:41.809 --> 00:46:41.819 align:start position:0%
that is part of the social emotional
 
00:46:44.210 --> 00:46:44.220 align:start position:0%
let's talk about Community how do we
 
00:46:46.130 --> 00:46:46.140 align:start position:0%
create a community how do we structure
 
00:46:48.410 --> 00:46:48.420 align:start position:0%
it how do we listen to all voices that
 
00:46:50.150 --> 00:46:50.160 align:start position:0%
is also part of social emotional
 
00:46:52.609 --> 00:46:52.619 align:start position:0%
learning so I think that there's things
 
00:46:55.130 --> 00:46:55.140 align:start position:0%
that could be done and I do know and I
 
00:46:57.349 --> 00:46:57.359 align:start position:0%
know um that you know we do in our
 
00:47:00.290 --> 00:47:00.300 align:start position:0%
programs we teach our students what they
 
00:47:01.790 --> 00:47:01.800 align:start position:0%
need to do I can tell you specifically
 
00:47:04.010 --> 00:47:04.020 align:start position:0%
in our social studies Ed our secondary
 
00:47:06.650 --> 00:47:06.660 align:start position:0%
program they do a lot in preparation
 
00:47:08.510 --> 00:47:08.520 align:start position:0%
there's a reason why they don't have to
 
00:47:10.730 --> 00:47:10.740 align:start position:0%
just major in history they can major in
 
00:47:13.550 --> 00:47:13.560 align:start position:0%
sociology or political science and all
 
00:47:15.290 --> 00:47:15.300 align:start position:0%
those because those come in but they
 
00:47:16.670 --> 00:47:16.680 align:start position:0%
still take courses to meet the
 
00:47:18.470 --> 00:47:18.480 align:start position:0%
competency but one of the things that
 
00:47:20.630 --> 00:47:20.640 align:start position:0%
our students can major in is Holocaust
 
00:47:23.530 --> 00:47:23.540 align:start position:0%
and genocide studies not only for our
 
00:47:25.910 --> 00:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
secondary Social Studies they can do
 
00:47:27.410 --> 00:47:27.420 align:start position:0%
that as their liberal arts but our
 
00:47:29.990 --> 00:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
elementary Ed and those allow them to
 
00:47:32.270 --> 00:47:32.280 align:start position:0%
learn this content and ways of teaching
 
00:47:34.130 --> 00:47:34.140 align:start position:0%
and engaging and stuff that they can
 
00:47:36.170 --> 00:47:36.180 align:start position:0%
bring bring into the classroom so I
 
00:47:39.349 --> 00:47:39.359 align:start position:0%
think we are doing the preparation piece
 
00:47:42.290 --> 00:47:42.300 align:start position:0%
in which teaching them how but I think
 
00:47:44.930 --> 00:47:44.940 align:start position:0%
that part of it is entering a school
 
00:47:47.030 --> 00:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
there's also all those other things that
 
00:47:49.130 --> 00:47:49.140 align:start position:0%
they're they're coming into conflict
 
00:47:51.230 --> 00:47:51.240 align:start position:0%
with but I will say I was meeting with
 
00:47:53.270 --> 00:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
the student yesterday I was telling them
 
00:47:55.190 --> 00:47:55.200 align:start position:0%
I was meeting about our courses for next
 
00:47:57.290 --> 00:47:57.300 align:start position:0%
year but she was telling me that she had
 
00:47:58.790 --> 00:47:58.800 align:start position:0%
just gotten back from Hinsdale and she
 
00:48:00.890 --> 00:48:00.900 align:start position:0%
was teaching she taught a lesson on the
 
00:48:03.170 --> 00:48:03.180 align:start position:0%
three branches of government she was in
 
00:48:04.609 --> 00:48:04.619 align:start position:0%
a fourth grade class and I was like okay
 
00:48:06.410 --> 00:48:06.420 align:start position:0%
look they are teaching some social
 
00:48:06.420 --> 00:48:07.550 align:start position:0%
look they are teaching some social
studies

00:48:07.550 --> 00:48:07.560 align:start position:0%
studies
 
00:48:09.470 --> 00:48:09.480 align:start position:0%
um but I think also having our students
 
00:48:11.870 --> 00:48:11.880 align:start position:0%
in there because they have to teach a
 
00:48:13.670 --> 00:48:13.680 align:start position:0%
letter so many literacy and so many
 
00:48:17.270 --> 00:48:17.280 align:start position:0%
social studies in a way it infuses it
 
00:48:20.030 --> 00:48:20.040 align:start position:0%
into the schools and maybe it changes it
 
00:48:20.040 --> 00:48:21.770 align:start position:0%
into the schools and maybe it changes it
yeah

00:48:21.770 --> 00:48:21.780 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:48:23.809 --> 00:48:23.819 align:start position:0%
I just thought it should have been
 
00:48:25.730 --> 00:48:25.740 align:start position:0%
um we're really trying to teach our
 
00:48:27.829 --> 00:48:27.839 align:start position:0%
students how to integrate right how do
 
00:48:29.510 --> 00:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
you work together when you're integrated
 
00:48:31.490 --> 00:48:31.500 align:start position:0%
because given the limited amount of time
 
00:48:33.349 --> 00:48:33.359 align:start position:0%
so a lot of social how do you kind of
 
00:48:36.230 --> 00:48:36.240 align:start position:0%
integrate um your Ela and your social
 
00:48:38.329 --> 00:48:38.339 align:start position:0%
studies together and really giving them
 
00:48:39.770 --> 00:48:39.780 align:start position:0%
those skills
 
00:48:41.630 --> 00:48:41.640 align:start position:0%
um going forward so that's being a big
 
00:48:44.089 --> 00:48:44.099 align:start position:0%
part uh recognizing The Limited you know
 
00:48:45.589 --> 00:48:45.599 align:start position:0%
I can't control what's in the school day
 
00:48:46.910 --> 00:48:46.920 align:start position:0%
and what's taught in the school day but
 
00:48:48.609 --> 00:48:48.619 align:start position:0%
what we can control is make sure our
 
00:48:50.930 --> 00:48:50.940 align:start position:0%
teachers are prepared our students are
 
00:48:53.930 --> 00:48:53.940 align:start position:0%
prepared to maximize that time when
 
00:48:55.390 --> 00:48:55.400 align:start position:0%
they're teaching and think about
 
00:49:00.069 --> 00:49:00.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:00.079 --> 00:49:01.910 align:start position:0%
 
or

00:49:01.910 --> 00:49:01.920 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:49:04.609 --> 00:49:04.619 align:start position:0%
where are you finding that your teachers
 
00:49:06.710 --> 00:49:06.720 align:start position:0%
are going to teach
 
00:49:08.809 --> 00:49:08.819 align:start position:0%
are they going to teach in public
 
00:49:08.819 --> 00:49:10.130 align:start position:0%
are they going to teach in public
schools

00:49:10.130 --> 00:49:10.140 align:start position:0%
schools
 
00:49:11.930 --> 00:49:11.940 align:start position:0%
private schools
 
00:49:15.109 --> 00:49:15.119 align:start position:0%
Etc and the second question is
 
00:49:17.030 --> 00:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
um how long do they stay there
 
00:49:20.210 --> 00:49:20.220 align:start position:0%
are you finding uh after the fifth year
 
00:49:22.370 --> 00:49:22.380 align:start position:0%
second year they find this is not what I
 
00:49:24.890 --> 00:49:24.900 align:start position:0%
want to do as a profession for a number
 
00:49:27.109 --> 00:49:27.119 align:start position:0%
of different reasons so the issue of the
 
00:49:29.870 --> 00:49:29.880 align:start position:0%
Fallout once they start their career
 
00:49:31.370 --> 00:49:31.380 align:start position:0%
what happened what's interesting is that
 
00:49:32.930 --> 00:49:32.940 align:start position:0%
one of the things we did with our survey
 
00:49:35.150 --> 00:49:35.160 align:start position:0%
we do a completer survey and as I
 
00:49:36.710 --> 00:49:36.720 align:start position:0%
mentioned with cape it's like five years
 
00:49:38.450 --> 00:49:38.460 align:start position:0%
and one of the things that we ask our
 
00:49:41.510 --> 00:49:41.520 align:start position:0%
student is are you currently teaching in
 
00:49:43.430 --> 00:49:43.440 align:start position:0%
the area that you're like you know
 
00:49:46.670 --> 00:49:46.680 align:start position:0%
licensed in our program and are you
 
00:49:48.650 --> 00:49:48.660 align:start position:0%
teaching private or public and I would
 
00:49:52.550 --> 00:49:52.560 align:start position:0%
say most are still teaching but um some
 
00:49:54.290 --> 00:49:54.300 align:start position:0%
of them may not be teaching you know
 
00:49:56.150 --> 00:49:56.160 align:start position:0%
like we might have had an LED that did
 
00:49:57.470 --> 00:49:57.480 align:start position:0%
special ed and now they're doing Special
 
00:49:59.510 --> 00:49:59.520 align:start position:0%
Ed but not Allied some of those pieces
 
00:49:59.520 --> 00:50:00.589 align:start position:0%
Ed but not Allied some of those pieces
but

00:50:00.589 --> 00:50:00.599 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:50:02.510 --> 00:50:02.520 align:start position:0%
I would say less than that but I don't
 
00:50:04.730 --> 00:50:04.740 align:start position:0%
think and I was at the teacher shortage
 
00:50:07.970 --> 00:50:07.980 align:start position:0%
last year or last fall
 
00:50:10.370 --> 00:50:10.380 align:start position:0%
a lot of them aren't staying in New
 
00:50:11.510 --> 00:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire unless they're from New
 
00:50:13.970 --> 00:50:13.980 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and it's because of the costs
 
00:50:17.690 --> 00:50:17.700 align:start position:0%
um we just the they have loans a lot of
 
00:50:20.150 --> 00:50:20.160 align:start position:0%
them are going home to live at home to
 
00:50:22.010 --> 00:50:22.020 align:start position:0%
start working they have connections in
 
00:50:25.190 --> 00:50:25.200 align:start position:0%
schools and like we have for example we
 
00:50:28.430 --> 00:50:28.440 align:start position:0%
have a graduate of ours she's taught now
 
00:50:30.950 --> 00:50:30.960 align:start position:0%
in Swansea which is the net you know
 
00:50:33.589 --> 00:50:33.599 align:start position:0%
right next to Keene for three years this
 
00:50:35.270 --> 00:50:35.280 align:start position:0%
is her third year she came straight out
 
00:50:37.069 --> 00:50:37.079 align:start position:0%
of our elementary ad has been teaching
 
00:50:39.650 --> 00:50:39.660 align:start position:0%
LED in the course place that she did her
 
00:50:41.630 --> 00:50:41.640 align:start position:0%
methods one and then there's student
 
00:50:43.849 --> 00:50:43.859 align:start position:0%
teaching so she stayed she's leaving
 
00:50:46.910 --> 00:50:46.920 align:start position:0%
because she can't afford the the pay her
 
00:50:49.010 --> 00:50:49.020 align:start position:0%
apartment anymore because housing she's
 
00:50:50.750 --> 00:50:50.760 align:start position:0%
not being paid enough to be able to live
 
00:50:54.410 --> 00:50:54.420 align:start position:0%
in the area too so she's going back home
 
00:50:56.270 --> 00:50:56.280 align:start position:0%
so that she can live with her boyfriend
 
00:50:58.730 --> 00:50:58.740 align:start position:0%
at shares costs so these are factors
 
00:51:01.430 --> 00:51:01.440 align:start position:0%
that affect them and I even said to them
 
00:51:04.910 --> 00:51:04.920 align:start position:0%
last uh fall I said I would love you
 
00:51:07.010 --> 00:51:07.020 align:start position:0%
guys are always welcome I know they come
 
00:51:08.750 --> 00:51:08.760 align:start position:0%
talk to our students and ask them I mean
 
00:51:10.790 --> 00:51:10.800 align:start position:0%
it's really fascinating to ask them like
 
00:51:13.010 --> 00:51:13.020 align:start position:0%
what is it that you're going to do or
 
00:51:14.870 --> 00:51:14.880 align:start position:0%
what are your plans but most of them I
 
00:51:17.030 --> 00:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
will say want to do public school
 
00:51:18.349 --> 00:51:18.359 align:start position:0%
because that's what they're trained in
 
00:51:20.750 --> 00:51:20.760 align:start position:0%
and that's what we have them um you know
 
00:51:24.370 --> 00:51:24.380 align:start position:0%
in other placements or public schools
 
00:51:27.349 --> 00:51:27.359 align:start position:0%
uh we find about 50 of our students stay
 
00:51:28.510 --> 00:51:28.520 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire
 
00:51:32.710 --> 00:51:32.720 align:start position:0%
how many are in a class you know uh
 
00:51:35.210 --> 00:51:35.220 align:start position:0%
sure if so we're gonna go undergraduate
 
00:51:37.609 --> 00:51:37.619 align:start position:0%
so if I'm gonna stay just undergraduate
 
00:51:40.430 --> 00:51:40.440 align:start position:0%
um per student uh we've probably run 100
 
00:51:43.069 --> 00:51:43.079 align:start position:0%
to 110 completers each year that's an
 
00:51:45.770 --> 00:51:45.780 align:start position:0%
education that is in the teacher
 
00:51:47.450 --> 00:51:47.460 align:start position:0%
certification program social studies
 
00:51:50.150 --> 00:51:50.160 align:start position:0%
Elementary Ed right around there
 
00:51:52.250 --> 00:51:52.260 align:start position:0%
um special education so it's about 50
 
00:51:54.470 --> 00:51:54.480 align:start position:0%
stay in New Hampshire 50 leave so you're
 
00:51:55.549 --> 00:51:55.559 align:start position:0%
already looking at that number that's
 
00:51:57.950 --> 00:51:57.960 align:start position:0%
here at Plymouth and then I think those
 
00:51:59.390 --> 00:51:59.400 align:start position:0%
are great questions you're asking and
 
00:52:01.130 --> 00:52:01.140 align:start position:0%
we're trying to follow those I think one
 
00:52:05.030 --> 00:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
if I could so we are research our data
 
00:52:06.770 --> 00:52:06.780 align:start position:0%
is based on two things surveys with
 
00:52:08.089 --> 00:52:08.099 align:start position:0%
students and the New Hampshire
 
00:52:10.609 --> 00:52:10.619 align:start position:0%
Department of Education educator search
 
00:52:13.130 --> 00:52:13.140 align:start position:0%
database if I could make a plug for
 
00:52:14.210 --> 00:52:14.220 align:start position:0%
something I think this would be
 
00:52:16.089 --> 00:52:16.099 align:start position:0%
something that would be great that maybe
 
00:52:18.290 --> 00:52:18.300 align:start position:0%
ihis could partner with the Department
 
00:52:20.210 --> 00:52:20.220 align:start position:0%
of Education to get the data even better
 
00:52:23.450 --> 00:52:23.460 align:start position:0%
because if individuals change names or
 
00:52:25.010 --> 00:52:25.020 align:start position:0%
you know it's easy to to lose some of
 
00:52:26.150 --> 00:52:26.160 align:start position:0%
that because I think these are really
 
00:52:29.270 --> 00:52:29.280 align:start position:0%
important questions how you know two
 
00:52:30.710 --> 00:52:30.720 align:start position:0%
years later are they still teaching
 
00:52:33.230 --> 00:52:33.240 align:start position:0%
three years and I will tell you I see a
 
00:52:34.609 --> 00:52:34.619 align:start position:0%
smaller trickle of folks that are
 
00:52:35.690 --> 00:52:35.700 align:start position:0%
finishing their student teach and be
 
00:52:37.130 --> 00:52:37.140 align:start position:0%
like I don't want to teach you know they
 
00:52:38.870 --> 00:52:38.880 align:start position:0%
did a good job but just decide right now
 
00:52:41.329 --> 00:52:41.339 align:start position:0%
I don't want to do this and I think you
 
00:52:42.530 --> 00:52:42.540 align:start position:0%
know and I can't give you concrete
 
00:52:44.030 --> 00:52:44.040 align:start position:0%
numbers and we're trying to measure this
 
00:52:46.069 --> 00:52:46.079 align:start position:0%
too and I think this is I think this is
 
00:52:48.410 --> 00:52:48.420 align:start position:0%
helpful because Nationwide teacher
 
00:52:49.910 --> 00:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
shortage Trends is looking at this you
 
00:52:51.950 --> 00:52:51.960 align:start position:0%
know it used to be that typically you
 
00:52:53.329 --> 00:52:53.339 align:start position:0%
knew someone's going to become a teacher
 
00:52:55.069 --> 00:52:55.079 align:start position:0%
you had three to five years before they
 
00:52:56.510 --> 00:52:56.520 align:start position:0%
might bail now they're talking about one
 
00:53:00.230 --> 00:53:00.240 align:start position:0%
to two years they're bailing out and I
 
00:53:01.630 --> 00:53:01.640 align:start position:0%
think that would be really fascinating
 
00:53:04.309 --> 00:53:04.319 align:start position:0%
as not just at Plymouth but I think you
 
00:53:06.650 --> 00:53:06.660 align:start position:0%
know across the whole if you know and
 
00:53:07.849 --> 00:53:07.859 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to work the Department of
 
00:53:09.170 --> 00:53:09.180 align:start position:0%
Education on this or figure out it's
 
00:53:11.270 --> 00:53:11.280 align:start position:0%
like okay how many individuals are
 
00:53:12.410 --> 00:53:12.420 align:start position:0%
getting New Hampshire teaching license
 
00:53:14.450 --> 00:53:14.460 align:start position:0%
and then quit and you know one year
 
00:53:16.609 --> 00:53:16.619 align:start position:0%
later or two years later and then if you
 
00:53:18.109 --> 00:53:18.119 align:start position:0%
really want to put a spotlight because I
 
00:53:20.210 --> 00:53:20.220 align:start position:0%
can say those folks that are quitting
 
00:53:22.069 --> 00:53:22.079 align:start position:0%
what were they doing are they graduating
 
00:53:23.690 --> 00:53:23.700 align:start position:0%
from a New Hampshire school are they
 
00:53:26.809 --> 00:53:26.819 align:start position:0%
graduating from um a state-based
 
00:53:28.549 --> 00:53:28.559 align:start position:0%
licensing plan are they graduating from
 
00:53:29.990 --> 00:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
out of state you know what I mean like
 
00:53:31.609 --> 00:53:31.619 align:start position:0%
start looking at those different factors
 
00:53:33.710 --> 00:53:33.720 align:start position:0%
but that's a lot of time but I think
 
00:53:36.349 --> 00:53:36.359 align:start position:0%
that starts it I think to get the
 
00:53:37.490 --> 00:53:37.500 align:start position:0%
answers to things I think you have to
 
00:53:39.230 --> 00:53:39.240 align:start position:0%
have data that really is painting an
 
00:53:40.910 --> 00:53:40.920 align:start position:0%
accurate picture not just anecdotally
 
00:53:40.920 --> 00:53:42.069 align:start position:0%
accurate picture not just anecdotally
but

00:53:42.069 --> 00:53:42.079 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:53:46.190 --> 00:53:46.200 align:start position:0%
and but I I don't know what happens
 
00:53:47.450 --> 00:53:47.460 align:start position:0%
going forward because I've definitely
 
00:53:48.950 --> 00:53:48.960 align:start position:0%
seen the past couple years like with
 
00:53:51.410 --> 00:53:51.420 align:start position:0%
covet a different thing definitely a
 
00:53:53.329 --> 00:53:53.339 align:start position:0%
number starting to trickle up who just
 
00:53:54.230 --> 00:53:54.240 align:start position:0%
saying that they're not going into
 
00:53:56.089 --> 00:53:56.099 align:start position:0%
teaching after graduating
 
00:53:58.130 --> 00:53:58.140 align:start position:0%
whether that's going to subside again or
 
00:54:00.230 --> 00:54:00.240 align:start position:0%
keep going you know that's that's a
 
00:54:02.990 --> 00:54:03.000 align:start position:0%
really important question to answer
 
00:54:04.910 --> 00:54:04.920 align:start position:0%
um how where do they come from how many
 
00:54:06.410 --> 00:54:06.420 align:start position:0%
are out of state students how many are
 
00:54:08.569 --> 00:54:08.579 align:start position:0%
in-state students when they start as
 
00:54:08.579 --> 00:54:09.890 align:start position:0%
in-state students when they start as
freshmen

00:54:09.890 --> 00:54:09.900 align:start position:0%
freshmen
 
00:54:11.870 --> 00:54:11.880 align:start position:0%
what percentage in the education
 
00:54:14.030 --> 00:54:14.040 align:start position:0%
programs yes
 
00:54:17.030 --> 00:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
I'd have to I I don't want to speak I'd
 
00:54:18.890 --> 00:54:18.900 align:start position:0%
have to go look at that data exactly I
 
00:54:20.870 --> 00:54:20.880 align:start position:0%
think I was gonna say about half for New
 
00:54:22.430 --> 00:54:22.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we get a lot from Connecticut
 
00:54:24.230 --> 00:54:24.240 align:start position:0%
yeah do you get a lot from Connecticut
 
00:54:26.390 --> 00:54:26.400 align:start position:0%
no we got a lot from Massachusetts we
 
00:54:28.430 --> 00:54:28.440 align:start position:0%
get some from Mass but we get a ton from
 
00:54:30.530 --> 00:54:30.540 align:start position:0%
like Connecticut's a big one some from
 
00:54:32.630 --> 00:54:32.640 align:start position:0%
Maine some for mass and some from New
 
00:54:34.730 --> 00:54:34.740 align:start position:0%
York but um I would say the biggest
 
00:54:35.990 --> 00:54:36.000 align:start position:0%
pockets are New Hampshire and
 
00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:36.950 align:start position:0%
pockets are New Hampshire and
Connecticut

00:54:36.950 --> 00:54:36.960 align:start position:0%
Connecticut
 
00:54:39.230 --> 00:54:39.240 align:start position:0%
so if you have approximately 50 coming
 
00:54:39.240 --> 00:54:40.430 align:start position:0%
so if you have approximately 50 coming
in

00:54:40.430 --> 00:54:40.440 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:54:42.309 --> 00:54:42.319 align:start position:0%
but 50 leaving
 
00:54:44.809 --> 00:54:44.819 align:start position:0%
it kind of balances doesn't it it does
 
00:54:49.430 --> 00:54:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:51.230 --> 00:54:51.240 align:start position:0%
um it does but it's
 
00:54:53.809 --> 00:54:53.819 align:start position:0%
um I do feel like that there's a lot um
 
00:54:55.190 --> 00:54:55.200 align:start position:0%
like I
 
00:55:00.049 --> 00:55:00.059 align:start position:0%
like SAU 29 which is a huge SAU right
 
00:55:01.910 --> 00:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
there in the bananica region they're
 
00:55:03.710 --> 00:55:03.720 align:start position:0%
always like oh but we want your students
 
00:55:06.470 --> 00:55:06.480 align:start position:0%
to stay and stay in keen and I was like
 
00:55:08.329 --> 00:55:08.339 align:start position:0%
I would love them to but they're not
 
00:55:09.950 --> 00:55:09.960 align:start position:0%
staying there because our number from
 
00:55:12.230 --> 00:55:12.240 align:start position:0%
that area is lower they're coming from
 
00:55:14.030 --> 00:55:14.040 align:start position:0%
other areas in New Hampshire so yes
 
00:55:16.190 --> 00:55:16.200 align:start position:0%
they're going back to those areas in New
 
00:55:17.990 --> 00:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but it may not support the
 
00:55:20.210 --> 00:55:20.220 align:start position:0%
Monadnock region as much I have noticed
 
00:55:21.829 --> 00:55:21.839 align:start position:0%
though our students who are doing our
 
00:55:23.870 --> 00:55:23.880 align:start position:0%
one-year special ed Masters because
 
00:55:25.370 --> 00:55:25.380 align:start position:0%
they're one year employed in the school
 
00:55:27.770 --> 00:55:27.780 align:start position:0%
those students we tend to have a higher
 
00:55:30.290 --> 00:55:30.300 align:start position:0%
percentage staying after graduation but
 
00:55:31.490 --> 00:55:31.500 align:start position:0%
I think it's because they're employed
 
00:55:33.049 --> 00:55:33.059 align:start position:0%
and they're kind of become invested in
 
00:55:37.370 --> 00:55:37.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:37.380 --> 00:55:38.809 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:55:38.809 --> 00:55:38.819 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:55:42.530 --> 00:55:42.540 align:start position:0%
well thanks thanks Rick and um uh the
 
00:55:44.030 --> 00:55:44.040 align:start position:0%
the question I'm going to ask is it's
 
00:55:46.069 --> 00:55:46.079 align:start position:0%
not it's it's not a political question
 
00:55:47.809 --> 00:55:47.819 align:start position:0%
but but I think it's it's it's
 
00:55:51.710 --> 00:55:51.720 align:start position:0%
appropriate at this given our where we
 
00:55:53.690 --> 00:55:53.700 align:start position:0%
are in the discussion but I'm wondering
 
00:55:56.630 --> 00:55:56.640 align:start position:0%
how your teacher training programs have
 
00:56:00.049 --> 00:56:00.059 align:start position:0%
adapted to the um the relatively new New
 
00:56:03.609 --> 00:56:03.619 align:start position:0%
Hampshire band Concepts uh law
 
00:56:07.010 --> 00:56:07.020 align:start position:0%
you mean the divisive concept correct we
 
00:56:08.750 --> 00:56:08.760 align:start position:0%
teach our students about it and and
 
00:56:11.270 --> 00:56:11.280 align:start position:0%
Empower them to know how to navigate it
 
00:56:13.849 --> 00:56:13.859 align:start position:0%
and I would say specifically
 
00:56:15.589 --> 00:56:15.599 align:start position:0%
um our social studies Ed and and
 
00:56:17.569 --> 00:56:17.579 align:start position:0%
ironically I should have brought my
 
00:56:19.730 --> 00:56:19.740 align:start position:0%
faculty member from that he does a lot
 
00:56:22.430 --> 00:56:22.440 align:start position:0%
on that um because the social studies
 
00:56:24.710 --> 00:56:24.720 align:start position:0%
tends to be the area where um that would
 
00:56:27.109 --> 00:56:27.119 align:start position:0%
come into play I think there's just a
 
00:56:30.770 --> 00:56:30.780 align:start position:0%
lot of stress on teachers in the schools
 
00:56:33.950 --> 00:56:33.960 align:start position:0%
they feel that they are being watched I
 
00:56:35.329 --> 00:56:35.339 align:start position:0%
think our student teachers have said
 
00:56:37.130 --> 00:56:37.140 align:start position:0%
that they're they're like can I do this
 
00:56:39.710 --> 00:56:39.720 align:start position:0%
can I do that and it's just navigating
 
00:56:41.210 --> 00:56:41.220 align:start position:0%
reminding them that you know it's about
 
00:56:42.890 --> 00:56:42.900 align:start position:0%
the facts and this is what the law says
 
00:56:45.109 --> 00:56:45.119 align:start position:0%
we've also had professional development
 
00:56:47.030 --> 00:56:47.040 align:start position:0%
we have the Southwest Center they've
 
00:56:48.829 --> 00:56:48.839 align:start position:0%
done a lot of webinars where they've
 
00:56:50.750 --> 00:56:50.760 align:start position:0%
brought in lawyers or Dottie Morris has
 
00:56:52.069 --> 00:56:52.079 align:start position:0%
talked about it or you know we have
 
00:56:54.410 --> 00:56:54.420 align:start position:0%
speakers that support not just our
 
00:56:56.990 --> 00:56:57.000 align:start position:0%
students but also the community and that
 
00:56:58.910 --> 00:56:58.920 align:start position:0%
teachers we offered them last year for
 
00:57:01.010 --> 00:57:01.020 align:start position:0%
free just so teachers and principals and
 
00:57:03.470 --> 00:57:03.480 align:start position:0%
superintendents could could engage in it
 
00:57:06.410 --> 00:57:06.420 align:start position:0%
be able to ask questions
 
00:57:08.990 --> 00:57:09.000 align:start position:0%
so yeah does that answer
 
00:57:12.290 --> 00:57:12.300 align:start position:0%
right right so so I I guess what I'm
 
00:57:15.049 --> 00:57:15.059 align:start position:0%
what I'm hearing is that is that yes the
 
00:57:18.650 --> 00:57:18.660 align:start position:0%
programs have adapted yes in in in light
 
00:57:23.089 --> 00:57:23.099 align:start position:0%
of this this change in um in law and um
 
00:57:25.930 --> 00:57:25.940 align:start position:0%
and I uh
 
00:57:28.790 --> 00:57:28.800 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean I think that's that's it and
 
00:57:32.210 --> 00:57:32.220 align:start position:0%
then do do the students do your students
 
00:57:34.790 --> 00:57:34.800 align:start position:0%
have have like sort of a clear
 
00:57:39.410 --> 00:57:39.420 align:start position:0%
understanding of of of where those
 
00:57:41.990 --> 00:57:42.000 align:start position:0%
you know where the the edge of the road
 
00:57:44.150 --> 00:57:44.160 align:start position:0%
is on
 
00:57:47.569 --> 00:57:47.579 align:start position:0%
on this because I hear that that's a
 
00:57:50.690 --> 00:57:50.700 align:start position:0%
sort of a common concern well I think it
 
00:57:54.109 --> 00:57:54.119 align:start position:0%
is I think that they I think we're clear
 
00:57:56.329 --> 00:57:56.339 align:start position:0%
about where the edge is and what they
 
00:57:58.309 --> 00:57:58.319 align:start position:0%
can and can't do but I think that
 
00:58:01.609 --> 00:58:01.619 align:start position:0%
students feel concerned like can I do
 
00:58:03.470 --> 00:58:03.480 align:start position:0%
this or can I say that or you know what
 
00:58:05.809 --> 00:58:05.819 align:start position:0%
I mean that because their intent they're
 
00:58:07.609 --> 00:58:07.619 align:start position:0%
taught um and it's interesting that we
 
00:58:09.410 --> 00:58:09.420 align:start position:0%
were talking about Civic engagement you
 
00:58:11.329 --> 00:58:11.339 align:start position:0%
know they're taught all these ways to
 
00:58:13.069 --> 00:58:13.079 align:start position:0%
bring in books especially for young
 
00:58:15.170 --> 00:58:15.180 align:start position:0%
children and all these activities and
 
00:58:17.030 --> 00:58:17.040 align:start position:0%
now they're going in and they're like
 
00:58:18.950 --> 00:58:18.960 align:start position:0%
is this okay to do even though it's good
 
00:58:21.349 --> 00:58:21.359 align:start position:0%
teaching and it is okay to do but it's
 
00:58:23.870 --> 00:58:23.880 align:start position:0%
made them kind of self-aware
 
00:58:25.730 --> 00:58:25.740 align:start position:0%
um and and I think that they're getting
 
00:58:27.829 --> 00:58:27.839 align:start position:0%
it not so much for our end but from when
 
00:58:29.329 --> 00:58:29.339 align:start position:0%
they're in the schools you know we even
 
00:58:31.010 --> 00:58:31.020 align:start position:0%
had a property and teacher was like no
 
00:58:32.450 --> 00:58:32.460 align:start position:0%
you need to give me your lesson plan
 
00:58:34.250 --> 00:58:34.260 align:start position:0%
three weeks in advance and I need to
 
00:58:36.170 --> 00:58:36.180 align:start position:0%
post it and the student's like wait
 
00:58:39.170 --> 00:58:39.180 align:start position:0%
three weeks you know I can't do that I'm
 
00:58:41.809 --> 00:58:41.819 align:start position:0%
a you know a method student so I think
 
00:58:41.819 --> 00:58:43.609 align:start position:0%
a you know a method student so I think
sometimes

00:58:43.609 --> 00:58:43.619 align:start position:0%
sometimes
 
00:58:45.829 --> 00:58:45.839 align:start position:0%
I don't know I think the politics of it
 
00:58:48.170 --> 00:58:48.180 align:start position:0%
sometimes get in the way of the the best
 
00:58:51.109 --> 00:58:51.119 align:start position:0%
practices of teaching set up
 
00:58:52.789 --> 00:58:52.799 align:start position:0%
a good way of saying
 
00:58:54.910 --> 00:58:54.920 align:start position:0%
can I talk for a second about
 
00:58:59.150 --> 00:58:59.160 align:start position:0%
integrating and or embedding uh content
 
00:59:02.329 --> 00:59:02.339 align:start position:0%
into another subject area or skills and
 
00:59:02.339 --> 00:59:03.470 align:start position:0%
into another subject area or skills and
knowledge

00:59:03.470 --> 00:59:03.480 align:start position:0%
knowledge
 
00:59:06.170 --> 00:59:06.180 align:start position:0%
um that that's a concept or a process a
 
00:59:07.609 --> 00:59:07.619 align:start position:0%
teaching method that's been around for
 
00:59:09.890 --> 00:59:09.900 align:start position:0%
years uh we had thematic reading
 
00:59:11.630 --> 00:59:11.640 align:start position:0%
programs where you bring in historical
 
00:59:14.750 --> 00:59:14.760 align:start position:0%
fiction into the the reading program and
 
00:59:17.690 --> 00:59:17.700 align:start position:0%
and it was quite effective do you and
 
00:59:19.670 --> 00:59:19.680 align:start position:0%
your higher education teacher prep
 
00:59:24.289 --> 00:59:24.299 align:start position:0%
programs uh teach how to embed where to
 
00:59:26.569 --> 00:59:26.579 align:start position:0%
embed and give suggestions as to how to
 
00:59:28.190 --> 00:59:28.200 align:start position:0%
do it I see that's part of the Civics
 
00:59:30.650 --> 00:59:30.660 align:start position:0%
bill here in the elementary schools and
 
00:59:32.390 --> 00:59:32.400 align:start position:0%
sometimes I think that's a little scary
 
00:59:35.030 --> 00:59:35.040 align:start position:0%
in the fact that and I'm an advocate of
 
00:59:37.549 --> 00:59:37.559 align:start position:0%
doing it but it's also a way of saying
 
00:59:38.450 --> 00:59:38.460 align:start position:0%
there's not going to be any
 
00:59:40.970 --> 00:59:40.980 align:start position:0%
accountability for it either and it's
 
00:59:43.190 --> 00:59:43.200 align:start position:0%
just not going to be taught whereas if
 
00:59:46.130 --> 00:59:46.140 align:start position:0%
there's a course like we do at the high
 
00:59:47.690 --> 00:59:47.700 align:start position:0%
school level there's a course in it
 
00:59:49.490 --> 00:59:49.500 align:start position:0%
that's going to be taught
 
00:59:49.500 --> 00:59:51.410 align:start position:0%
that's going to be taught
hopefully

00:59:51.410 --> 00:59:51.420 align:start position:0%
hopefully
 
00:59:54.470 --> 00:59:54.480 align:start position:0%
um but when you say embed it it becomes
 
00:59:57.470 --> 00:59:57.480 align:start position:0%
part of that language arts reading class
 
00:59:59.030 --> 00:59:59.040 align:start position:0%
and if you have a person that's a
 
01:00:01.490 --> 01:00:01.500 align:start position:0%
reading language arts person perhaps
 
01:00:03.650 --> 01:00:03.660 align:start position:0%
they don't you know that's not what
 
01:00:05.690 --> 01:00:05.700 align:start position:0%
willing to embed a social studies
 
01:00:09.109 --> 01:00:09.119 align:start position:0%
concept into that class
 
01:00:11.450 --> 01:00:11.460 align:start position:0%
um then it's not going to be taught
 
01:00:13.970 --> 01:00:13.980 align:start position:0%
so how do we how do we prepare teachers
 
01:00:16.970 --> 01:00:16.980 align:start position:0%
to to go ahead and embed and integrate
 
01:00:16.980 --> 01:00:18.589 align:start position:0%
to to go ahead and embed and integrate
properly

01:00:18.589 --> 01:00:18.599 align:start position:0%
properly
 
01:00:20.809 --> 01:00:20.819 align:start position:0%
so for elementary education what we're
 
01:00:22.670 --> 01:00:22.680 align:start position:0%
actually doing is our faculty are
 
01:00:24.650 --> 01:00:24.660 align:start position:0%
modeling that we've actually adopted the
 
01:00:26.329 --> 01:00:26.339 align:start position:0%
program they changed kind of the course
 
01:00:27.829 --> 01:00:27.839 align:start position:0%
sequence and what they're doing so the
 
01:00:29.270 --> 01:00:29.280 align:start position:0%
faculty or team teaching and working
 
01:00:32.270 --> 01:00:32.280 align:start position:0%
together and showing how to embed
 
01:00:35.390 --> 01:00:35.400 align:start position:0%
um that kind of having a user integrated
 
01:00:37.430 --> 01:00:37.440 align:start position:0%
methods course where it's not just
 
01:00:38.690 --> 01:00:38.700 align:start position:0%
saying oh this is how you teach social
 
01:00:41.390 --> 01:00:41.400 align:start position:0%
studies this is how you teach Ela
 
01:00:43.130 --> 01:00:43.140 align:start position:0%
they're actually doing it all together
 
01:00:45.109 --> 01:00:45.119 align:start position:0%
so that they are modeling what needs to
 
01:00:47.030 --> 01:00:47.040 align:start position:0%
happen the work the students are a part
 
01:00:49.609 --> 01:00:49.619 align:start position:0%
of that and that then they can take that
 
01:00:50.990 --> 01:00:51.000 align:start position:0%
knowledge this is while they're in that
 
01:00:52.910 --> 01:00:52.920 align:start position:0%
one year practicum a one-year internship
 
01:00:54.829 --> 01:00:54.839 align:start position:0%
with a practicum in the fall then they
 
01:00:56.329 --> 01:00:56.339 align:start position:0%
have the opportunities to apply it while
 
01:00:57.710 --> 01:00:57.720 align:start position:0%
they're there
 
01:01:00.230 --> 01:01:00.240 align:start position:0%
um so you're right there's no the the
 
01:01:02.809 --> 01:01:02.819 align:start position:0%
best way I think is to model it to the
 
01:01:04.069 --> 01:01:04.079 align:start position:0%
practice you almost practice what we
 
01:01:05.450 --> 01:01:05.460 align:start position:0%
preach and that's what we're focused on
 
01:01:07.730 --> 01:01:07.740 align:start position:0%
doing the elementary Ed level um so that
 
01:01:09.890 --> 01:01:09.900 align:start position:0%
our graduates are more prepared to go
 
01:01:12.230 --> 01:01:12.240 align:start position:0%
into a school situation where maybe this
 
01:01:14.210 --> 01:01:14.220 align:start position:0%
due to schedule whatever out they don't
 
01:01:16.490 --> 01:01:16.500 align:start position:0%
have as much time as you would like with
 
01:01:17.750 --> 01:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
some of these different but how can they
 
01:01:19.609 --> 01:01:19.619 align:start position:0%
think I just said how can they work
 
01:01:19.619 --> 01:01:20.630 align:start position:0%
think I just said how can they work
together

01:01:20.630 --> 01:01:20.640 align:start position:0%
together
 
01:01:23.150 --> 01:01:23.160 align:start position:0%
um to make sure that the students um at
 
01:01:24.470 --> 01:01:24.480 align:start position:0%
all grade levels are having social
 
01:01:26.930 --> 01:01:26.940 align:start position:0%
studies and having science content yeah
 
01:01:29.510 --> 01:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
and I would just add to that that by the
 
01:01:31.549 --> 01:01:31.559 align:start position:0%
model that Brian's talking about that we
 
01:01:34.010 --> 01:01:34.020 align:start position:0%
also do too with the social studies in
 
01:01:36.829 --> 01:01:36.839 align:start position:0%
literature uh the ELA and then we have
 
01:01:39.289 --> 01:01:39.299 align:start position:0%
um the science and math but it also is
 
01:01:41.450 --> 01:01:41.460 align:start position:0%
another way that as these schools are
 
01:01:43.609 --> 01:01:43.619 align:start position:0%
you know taking some of the science of
 
01:01:45.770 --> 01:01:45.780 align:start position:0%
math out we're saying no look if you put
 
01:01:47.930 --> 01:01:47.940 align:start position:0%
these together you bring it in like why
 
01:01:50.089 --> 01:01:50.099 align:start position:0%
would you separate math and science or
 
01:01:51.770 --> 01:01:51.780 align:start position:0%
you know social studies you know bring
 
01:01:54.410 --> 01:01:54.420 align:start position:0%
these pieces in so that they're they get
 
01:01:56.750 --> 01:01:56.760 align:start position:0%
to see these Concepts through multiple
 
01:01:58.910 --> 01:01:58.920 align:start position:0%
ways or lenses or any of those things
 
01:02:01.309 --> 01:02:01.319 align:start position:0%
and and that's where you know social
 
01:02:03.289 --> 01:02:03.299 align:start position:0%
studies think about I had a my daughter
 
01:02:04.730 --> 01:02:04.740 align:start position:0%
was telling me a sixth grade you know
 
01:02:06.829 --> 01:02:06.839 align:start position:0%
like they they had debates and then they
 
01:02:08.630 --> 01:02:08.640 align:start position:0%
did a vote and they did this democracy
 
01:02:11.030 --> 01:02:11.040 align:start position:0%
and so it is all kind of you know
 
01:02:12.770 --> 01:02:12.780 align:start position:0%
embedded in it and it was was actually
 
01:02:14.390 --> 01:02:14.400 align:start position:0%
sorry it was when she was in fifth grade
 
01:02:16.190 --> 01:02:16.200 align:start position:0%
she's in sixth grade now but they
 
01:02:18.289 --> 01:02:18.299 align:start position:0%
integrated and I think that you're
 
01:02:19.609 --> 01:02:19.619 align:start position:0%
seeing more and more teachers and
 
01:02:20.630 --> 01:02:20.640 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I think it's more like
 
01:02:22.490 --> 01:02:22.500 align:start position:0%
fourth fifth grade that they do it it
 
01:02:25.010 --> 01:02:25.020 align:start position:0%
needs to start lower but I think that
 
01:02:26.450 --> 01:02:26.460 align:start position:0%
there are some really good teachers and
 
01:02:28.309 --> 01:02:28.319 align:start position:0%
part of the things that we do in teacher
 
01:02:30.530 --> 01:02:30.540 align:start position:0%
prep is that we don't just say oh you
 
01:02:31.849 --> 01:02:31.859 align:start position:0%
want to volunteer to be a cooperating
 
01:02:33.710 --> 01:02:33.720 align:start position:0%
teacher we don't do that we also screen
 
01:02:35.630 --> 01:02:35.640 align:start position:0%
because we want our students to be
 
01:02:38.270 --> 01:02:38.280 align:start position:0%
placed purposefully that we are looking
 
01:02:40.309 --> 01:02:40.319 align:start position:0%
for teachers that have had the years and
 
01:02:42.049 --> 01:02:42.059 align:start position:0%
they're they're willing to embed and to
 
01:02:44.349 --> 01:02:44.359 align:start position:0%
work with our students to provide these
 
01:02:49.130 --> 01:02:49.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:49.140 --> 01:02:51.170 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:02:51.170 --> 01:02:51.180 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:02:54.069 --> 01:02:54.079 align:start position:0%
along those lines thanks Rick
 
01:02:57.049 --> 01:02:57.059 align:start position:0%
one of a very successful integration
 
01:03:00.530 --> 01:03:00.540 align:start position:0%
that that actually we saw at nhti was uh
 
01:03:03.349 --> 01:03:03.359 align:start position:0%
was uh with uh with mindful
 
01:03:06.650 --> 01:03:06.660 align:start position:0%
Communications uh it started out as a um
 
01:03:09.950 --> 01:03:09.960 align:start position:0%
I think as a as an as a program in in
 
01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:11.510 align:start position:0%
I think as a as an as a program in in
English

01:03:11.510 --> 01:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
English
 
01:03:14.690 --> 01:03:14.700 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:17.030 --> 01:03:17.040 align:start position:0%
right right and and then was later
 
01:03:18.829 --> 01:03:18.839 align:start position:0%
integrated in with with a lot of the
 
01:03:20.930 --> 01:03:20.940 align:start position:0%
engineering curriculum and and others
 
01:03:22.789 --> 01:03:22.799 align:start position:0%
and I've heard great really really
 
01:03:24.530 --> 01:03:24.540 align:start position:0%
strong things and I was wondering if
 
01:03:27.770 --> 01:03:27.780 align:start position:0%
maybe Mark and Shannon could could talk
 
01:03:29.089 --> 01:03:29.099 align:start position:0%
a little bit about that and whether or
 
01:03:31.430 --> 01:03:31.440 align:start position:0%
not that could also have
 
01:03:34.849 --> 01:03:34.859 align:start position:0%
um have you know positive results at the
 
01:03:38.349 --> 01:03:38.359 align:start position:0%
um primary and secondary level too
 
01:03:40.789 --> 01:03:40.799 align:start position:0%
I don't know how much I can really talk
 
01:03:42.410 --> 01:03:42.420 align:start position:0%
about that in detail but I think it's um
 
01:03:44.450 --> 01:03:44.460 align:start position:0%
it started out as almost like a
 
01:03:44.460 --> 01:03:45.829 align:start position:0%
it started out as almost like a
um

01:03:45.829 --> 01:03:45.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:47.329 --> 01:03:47.339 align:start position:0%
I won't say professional development but
 
01:03:48.770 --> 01:03:48.780 align:start position:0%
it's sort of an optional thing that that
 
01:03:51.710 --> 01:03:51.720 align:start position:0%
students and faculty could could look at
 
01:03:53.270 --> 01:03:53.280 align:start position:0%
um and has become something that they've
 
01:03:54.589 --> 01:03:54.599 align:start position:0%
integrated I think into Health our
 
01:03:56.950 --> 01:03:56.960 align:start position:0%
health programs too where people will be
 
01:03:58.910 --> 01:03:58.920 align:start position:0%
Healthcare practitioners working with
 
01:04:00.530 --> 01:04:00.540 align:start position:0%
others which is a can be a stressful
 
01:04:03.109 --> 01:04:03.119 align:start position:0%
thing um so yeah I think it's become a
 
01:04:06.170 --> 01:04:06.180 align:start position:0%
much more broadly used
 
01:04:12.530 --> 01:04:12.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:15.170 --> 01:04:15.180 align:start position:0%
anything further and just wondering if
 
01:04:17.750 --> 01:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
that that's something that that might be
 
01:04:20.930 --> 01:04:20.940 align:start position:0%
considered that is some of our you know
 
01:04:22.970 --> 01:04:22.980 align:start position:0%
primary consecutive
 
01:04:25.130 --> 01:04:25.140 align:start position:0%
I think it um I do know like at King
 
01:04:26.450 --> 01:04:26.460 align:start position:0%
State and I'm sure Plymouth there are
 
01:04:28.250 --> 01:04:28.260 align:start position:0%
mindfulness classes we have meditation
 
01:04:30.650 --> 01:04:30.660 align:start position:0%
courses we have yoga we have all these
 
01:04:32.690 --> 01:04:32.700 align:start position:0%
things that we allow our college
 
01:04:34.670 --> 01:04:34.680 align:start position:0%
students to think about but I do think
 
01:04:36.829 --> 01:04:36.839 align:start position:0%
it's interesting I think for our
 
01:04:38.809 --> 01:04:38.819 align:start position:0%
elementary Ed and it's not exactly
 
01:04:40.609 --> 01:04:40.619 align:start position:0%
mindfulness we teach our students um
 
01:04:43.309 --> 01:04:43.319 align:start position:0%
responsive classroom which is
 
01:04:45.170 --> 01:04:45.180 align:start position:0%
kind of I guess the elementary of
 
01:04:47.569 --> 01:04:47.579 align:start position:0%
creating that community and culture and
 
01:04:49.910 --> 01:04:49.920 align:start position:0%
taking that moment to settle in the
 
01:04:51.650 --> 01:04:51.660 align:start position:0%
morning and to connect with your peers
 
01:04:53.930 --> 01:04:53.940 align:start position:0%
and you know get to know each other so
 
01:04:56.990 --> 01:04:57.000 align:start position:0%
it's kind of that concept that we do uh
 
01:04:58.789 --> 01:04:58.799 align:start position:0%
teach and it was interesting because I
 
01:05:02.030 --> 01:05:02.040 align:start position:0%
was at the um the SAU 29 strategic
 
01:05:04.370 --> 01:05:04.380 align:start position:0%
planning committee last night
 
01:05:07.490 --> 01:05:07.500 align:start position:0%
um and I was we were talking about the
 
01:05:09.109 --> 01:05:09.119 align:start position:0%
um social emotional learning but you
 
01:05:10.190 --> 01:05:10.200 align:start position:0%
know it's really clear in the elementary
 
01:05:11.870 --> 01:05:11.880 align:start position:0%
and then there's some pieces in the
 
01:05:13.309 --> 01:05:13.319 align:start position:0%
middle and then it's like what happens
 
01:05:15.589 --> 01:05:15.599 align:start position:0%
at the high school you know and uh even
 
01:05:16.970 --> 01:05:16.980 align:start position:0%
the principal said at the high school
 
01:05:18.770 --> 01:05:18.780 align:start position:0%
it's like either like the mental health
 
01:05:20.990 --> 01:05:21.000 align:start position:0%
like top tier or at the bottom where
 
01:05:23.210 --> 01:05:23.220 align:start position:0%
it's like oh okay this is the high
 
01:05:25.490 --> 01:05:25.500 align:start position:0%
school there's not much in the middle so
 
01:05:27.230 --> 01:05:27.240 align:start position:0%
it's interesting to me that I almost
 
01:05:29.690 --> 01:05:29.700 align:start position:0%
wonder if it's not something to really
 
01:05:31.549 --> 01:05:31.559 align:start position:0%
consider more so for like the Middle
 
01:05:33.410 --> 01:05:33.420 align:start position:0%
High School where I think some of that
 
01:05:36.770 --> 01:05:36.780 align:start position:0%
is not stressed as much or included in
 
01:05:39.049 --> 01:05:39.059 align:start position:0%
the teaching practices so it is
 
01:05:42.470 --> 01:05:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:44.990 --> 01:05:45.000 align:start position:0%
are all elementary teachers required to
 
01:05:48.530 --> 01:05:48.540 align:start position:0%
take a methods course in social studies
 
01:05:51.710 --> 01:05:51.720 align:start position:0%
yeah yes they are both of our programs
 
01:05:54.170 --> 01:05:54.180 align:start position:0%
though do it as a larger methods where
 
01:05:56.089 --> 01:05:56.099 align:start position:0%
it has like social studies and something
 
01:05:58.849 --> 01:05:58.859 align:start position:0%
else but it is you you have to have the
 
01:06:01.370 --> 01:06:01.380 align:start position:0%
um method social studies science math
 
01:06:03.650 --> 01:06:03.660 align:start position:0%
and literacy so it is part of the
 
01:06:06.170 --> 01:06:06.180 align:start position:0%
standards to cover those
 
01:06:08.630 --> 01:06:08.640 align:start position:0%
so when when did it change when I went
 
01:06:11.270 --> 01:06:11.280 align:start position:0%
to school get my elementary ticket
 
01:06:15.410 --> 01:06:15.420 align:start position:0%
I teach a course in math methods of math
 
01:06:17.809 --> 01:06:17.819 align:start position:0%
math is a language art methods of
 
01:06:22.490 --> 01:06:22.500 align:start position:0%
cursive methods of social studies and
 
01:06:25.670 --> 01:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
science they're all separate and
 
01:06:28.490 --> 01:06:28.500 align:start position:0%
and I you know I I think they were there
 
01:06:30.589 --> 01:06:30.599 align:start position:0%
you know there was some repetition of
 
01:06:30.599 --> 01:06:32.230 align:start position:0%
you know there was some repetition of
course

01:06:32.230 --> 01:06:32.240 align:start position:0%
course
 
01:06:34.670 --> 01:06:34.680 align:start position:0%
studies I really remember because I got
 
01:06:37.010 --> 01:06:37.020 align:start position:0%
into some good content I loved it and
 
01:06:38.630 --> 01:06:38.640 align:start position:0%
they do and we do the integrated too
 
01:06:40.370 --> 01:06:40.380 align:start position:0%
because what happens with our elementary
 
01:06:42.950 --> 01:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
specifically in methods one they're out
 
01:06:44.630 --> 01:06:44.640 align:start position:0%
in the field so methods one because it's
 
01:06:46.910 --> 01:06:46.920 align:start position:0%
eight credit is eight to noon
 
01:06:49.130 --> 01:06:49.140 align:start position:0%
um every Monday through Thursday and
 
01:06:51.170 --> 01:06:51.180 align:start position:0%
they are they have two days of content
 
01:06:54.170 --> 01:06:54.180 align:start position:0%
so 18 in two days in the field so the
 
01:06:55.849 --> 01:06:55.859 align:start position:0%
goal is to really kind of balance that
 
01:06:57.470 --> 01:06:57.480 align:start position:0%
they get that content piece that you're
 
01:06:59.270 --> 01:06:59.280 align:start position:0%
talking about but they also get to have
 
01:07:02.510 --> 01:07:02.520 align:start position:0%
that like needed time where they're kind
 
01:07:04.849 --> 01:07:04.859 align:start position:0%
of extended time in the school to really
 
01:07:05.990 --> 01:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
kind of get to know it and then when
 
01:07:07.730 --> 01:07:07.740 align:start position:0%
they get to methods two and they're
 
01:07:09.650 --> 01:07:09.660 align:start position:0%
doing the science and math they're in
 
01:07:11.630 --> 01:07:11.640 align:start position:0%
the schools either Monday or Wednesday
 
01:07:14.089 --> 01:07:14.099 align:start position:0%
from eight to three and then their
 
01:07:16.430 --> 01:07:16.440 align:start position:0%
contents taught um and then they have a
 
01:07:17.750 --> 01:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
time in the beginning but then they come
 
01:07:20.329 --> 01:07:20.339 align:start position:0%
to campus on Friday for a half day so I
 
01:07:23.390 --> 01:07:23.400 align:start position:0%
think the reason for us we made the
 
01:07:25.010 --> 01:07:25.020 align:start position:0%
change is that we wanted to have more
 
01:07:26.390 --> 01:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
integration more time in the school
 
01:07:27.710 --> 01:07:27.720 align:start position:0%
where they can make the connections
 
01:07:30.109 --> 01:07:30.119 align:start position:0%
because it is hard if you just do social
 
01:07:32.990 --> 01:07:33.000 align:start position:0%
studies and you you go to do a placement
 
01:07:34.670 --> 01:07:34.680 align:start position:0%
they may not be teaching social studies
 
01:07:36.710 --> 01:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
when you have them in the school so by
 
01:07:38.690 --> 01:07:38.700 align:start position:0%
having these extended it allows them to
 
01:07:41.390 --> 01:07:41.400 align:start position:0%
kind of see several things being taught
 
01:07:43.670 --> 01:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
and teach throughout the day versus just
 
01:07:46.609 --> 01:07:46.619 align:start position:0%
for a smaller time I don't know if it's
 
01:07:48.770 --> 01:07:48.780 align:start position:0%
similar we had exactly the setup you
 
01:07:50.270 --> 01:07:50.280 align:start position:0%
described Elementary education until
 
01:07:53.930 --> 01:07:53.940 align:start position:0%
about 2019 or 2020 we had a three credit
 
01:07:55.370 --> 01:07:55.380 align:start position:0%
course in each of those so it's 12
 
01:07:57.950 --> 01:07:57.960 align:start position:0%
credits total part of why we made that
 
01:07:59.809 --> 01:07:59.819 align:start position:0%
change was feedback listening to
 
01:08:01.370 --> 01:08:01.380 align:start position:0%
feedback you know what was happening
 
01:08:03.770 --> 01:08:03.780 align:start position:0%
from our alumni listening to feedback
 
01:08:05.690 --> 01:08:05.700 align:start position:0%
what was happening at schools is saying
 
01:08:05.700 --> 01:08:07.069 align:start position:0%
what was happening at schools is saying
that

01:08:07.069 --> 01:08:07.079 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:08:10.430 --> 01:08:10.440 align:start position:0%
um if it was we really had a focus on
 
01:08:12.829 --> 01:08:12.839 align:start position:0%
the integration of these so that's why
 
01:08:14.089 --> 01:08:14.099 align:start position:0%
we made so it's the same number of
 
01:08:16.550 --> 01:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
credit hours in this in the field but
 
01:08:18.289 --> 01:08:18.299 align:start position:0%
now they just took this into an
 
01:08:20.809 --> 01:08:20.819 align:start position:0%
integrated methods course to say across
 
01:08:22.789 --> 01:08:22.799 align:start position:0%
the board and say um you know so still
 
01:08:25.010 --> 01:08:25.020 align:start position:0%
12 credits total that they have
 
01:08:27.470 --> 01:08:27.480 align:start position:0%
um now they are just they're doing the
 
01:08:29.150 --> 01:08:29.160 align:start position:0%
content piece as well but they're really
 
01:08:30.890 --> 01:08:30.900 align:start position:0%
they're we're not just looking at Social
 
01:08:32.870 --> 01:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
Studies alone because we're not looking
 
01:08:35.390 --> 01:08:35.400 align:start position:0%
at science alone they're taking they
 
01:08:37.130 --> 01:08:37.140 align:start position:0%
still learning how to teach those but
 
01:08:38.689 --> 01:08:38.699 align:start position:0%
they're also really learning how can we
 
01:08:40.010 --> 01:08:40.020 align:start position:0%
embed these together in a good
 
01:08:41.870 --> 01:08:41.880 align:start position:0%
elementary school classroom
 
01:08:43.010 --> 01:08:43.020 align:start position:0%
um and that's our goal and that's what
 
01:08:44.450 --> 01:08:44.460 align:start position:0%
we're you know trying to prepare them
 
01:08:46.729 --> 01:08:46.739 align:start position:0%
for the challenge becomes is what
 
01:08:48.289 --> 01:08:48.299 align:start position:0%
setting they go into after they graduate
 
01:08:50.090 --> 01:08:50.100 align:start position:0%
from us right in terms of how much of
 
01:08:51.709 --> 01:08:51.719 align:start position:0%
the school curriculum is dictated how
 
01:08:53.329 --> 01:08:53.339 align:start position:0%
much flexibility they have you know
 
01:08:55.070 --> 01:08:55.080 align:start position:0%
those are other pieces you know the
 
01:08:56.809 --> 01:08:56.819 align:start position:0%
puzzle there but we're trying as much as
 
01:08:58.849 --> 01:08:58.859 align:start position:0%
possible to prepare our students so that
 
01:09:00.769 --> 01:09:00.779 align:start position:0%
they they are ready to integrate and
 
01:09:00.779 --> 01:09:02.090 align:start position:0%
they they are ready to integrate and
teach

01:09:02.090 --> 01:09:02.100 align:start position:0%
teach
 
01:09:04.309 --> 01:09:04.319 align:start position:0%
um all those content areas in elementary
 
01:09:04.319 --> 01:09:09.050 align:start position:0%
um all those content areas in elementary
education

01:09:09.050 --> 01:09:09.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:12.169 --> 01:09:12.179 align:start position:0%
it generates some concern to me that
 
01:09:14.570 --> 01:09:14.580 align:start position:0%
years ago we had allocated so many
 
01:09:17.749 --> 01:09:17.759 align:start position:0%
minutes per per week to be taught in
 
01:09:20.030 --> 01:09:20.040 align:start position:0%
certain subject areas
 
01:09:22.309 --> 01:09:22.319 align:start position:0%
yeah that that went by the boards and I
 
01:09:24.669 --> 01:09:24.679 align:start position:0%
understand why but it also though
 
01:09:27.590 --> 01:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
guaranteed that those courses were being
 
01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:28.970 align:start position:0%
guaranteed that those courses were being
taught

01:09:28.970 --> 01:09:28.980 align:start position:0%
taught
 
01:09:31.370 --> 01:09:31.380 align:start position:0%
now we don't have that and there's I
 
01:09:32.749 --> 01:09:32.759 align:start position:0%
don't think there's any guarantee and
 
01:09:34.309 --> 01:09:34.319 align:start position:0%
after hearing some people speak and
 
01:09:36.590 --> 01:09:36.600 align:start position:0%
hearings here I'm not so sure that we
 
01:09:38.450 --> 01:09:38.460 align:start position:0%
are teaching social studies the way we
 
01:09:40.610 --> 01:09:40.620 align:start position:0%
should be teaching it so the kids are
 
01:09:41.870 --> 01:09:41.880 align:start position:0%
coming knowledgeable and knowing New
 
01:09:44.930 --> 01:09:44.940 align:start position:0%
Mexico is not part of Mexico
 
01:09:44.940 --> 01:09:45.950 align:start position:0%
Mexico is not part of Mexico
um

01:09:45.950 --> 01:09:45.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:52.090 --> 01:09:52.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:56.090 --> 01:09:56.100 align:start position:0%
you used to be a social studies teacher
 
01:09:59.390 --> 01:09:59.400 align:start position:0%
um God support me on this
 
01:10:04.189 --> 01:10:04.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:06.470 --> 01:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
I taught social studies at kid in high
 
01:10:08.209 --> 01:10:08.219 align:start position:0%
school in Conway New Hampshire
 
01:10:10.070 --> 01:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
and then at Bishop Bradley High School
 
01:10:12.770 --> 01:10:12.780 align:start position:0%
it'd be interested New Hampshire it's a
 
01:10:13.850 --> 01:10:13.860 align:start position:0%
different world
 
01:10:17.090 --> 01:10:17.100 align:start position:0%
I mean I go to I take I don't want to
 
01:10:19.430 --> 01:10:19.440 align:start position:0%
take time because we get the other
 
01:10:20.689 --> 01:10:20.699 align:start position:0%
things yeah
 
01:10:23.209 --> 01:10:23.219 align:start position:0%
um I visit my schools I visit every
 
01:10:25.790 --> 01:10:25.800 align:start position:0%
school in my district every year
 
01:10:28.490 --> 01:10:28.500 align:start position:0%
and basically I I visit fourth grade
 
01:10:30.410 --> 01:10:30.420 align:start position:0%
classes because they're taking New
 
01:10:33.470 --> 01:10:33.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire history it
 
01:10:35.450 --> 01:10:35.460 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
01:10:37.550 --> 01:10:37.560 align:start position:0%
the world is so different
 
01:10:37.560 --> 01:10:39.050 align:start position:0%
the world is so different
uh

01:10:39.050 --> 01:10:39.060 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:10:42.649 --> 01:10:42.659 align:start position:0%
one of the great problems I think is the
 
01:10:44.830 --> 01:10:44.840 align:start position:0%
constant changing of Administrators
 
01:10:48.169 --> 01:10:48.179 align:start position:0%
principles of Disappearing at Park
 
01:10:51.290 --> 01:10:51.300 align:start position:0%
navani we don't have a principal we've
 
01:10:53.030 --> 01:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
had a principal and leave for what six
 
01:10:57.169 --> 01:10:57.179 align:start position:0%
months at least so so what's going on in
 
01:10:59.689 --> 01:10:59.699 align:start position:0%
terms of the operation of of the school
 
01:11:01.430 --> 01:11:01.440 align:start position:0%
we got a great superintendent I think
 
01:11:04.850 --> 01:11:04.860 align:start position:0%
she's she's working hard but to get to
 
01:11:07.729 --> 01:11:07.739 align:start position:0%
the Chairman's situation it's a
 
01:11:09.530 --> 01:11:09.540 align:start position:0%
different world
 
01:11:12.169 --> 01:11:12.179 align:start position:0%
and I think we have to we have to adapt
 
01:11:15.229 --> 01:11:15.239 align:start position:0%
to the to the new world of an old world
 
01:11:18.290 --> 01:11:18.300 align:start position:0%
guy it's very hard to adapt to the new
 
01:11:21.590 --> 01:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
world but but you have to do it that's
 
01:11:23.510 --> 01:11:23.520 align:start position:0%
why I think
 
01:11:25.250 --> 01:11:25.260 align:start position:0%
trading of
 
01:11:26.830 --> 01:11:26.840 align:start position:0%
trading is
 
01:11:29.990 --> 01:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
challenging to say the least recruiting
 
01:11:32.689 --> 01:11:32.699 align:start position:0%
kids to get into the business is even
 
01:11:34.850 --> 01:11:34.860 align:start position:0%
more challenging is even more
 
01:11:34.860 --> 01:11:38.890 align:start position:0%
more challenging is even more
challenging

01:11:38.890 --> 01:11:38.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:41.030 --> 01:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
I have three kids
 
01:11:42.410 --> 01:11:42.420 align:start position:0%
none of them
 
01:11:44.990 --> 01:11:45.000 align:start position:0%
none of them chose education as they're
 
01:11:47.030 --> 01:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:11:49.490 --> 01:11:49.500 align:start position:0%
field of study I just think you have
 
01:11:51.590 --> 01:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
your challenges you get you have the
 
01:11:53.950 --> 01:11:53.960 align:start position:0%
enrollment challenge getting kids in
 
01:11:57.229 --> 01:11:57.239 align:start position:0%
once they're in retaining them getting
 
01:11:59.510 --> 01:11:59.520 align:start position:0%
getting them to do the kind of teaching
 
01:12:01.790 --> 01:12:01.800 align:start position:0%
that that makes a lot of sense in terms
 
01:12:05.090 --> 01:12:05.100 align:start position:0%
of a real educational experience
 
01:12:05.100 --> 01:12:05.750 align:start position:0%
of a real educational experience
um

01:12:05.750 --> 01:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:08.570 --> 01:12:08.580 align:start position:0%
it's just a it's a it's a tough world
 
01:12:12.110 --> 01:12:12.120 align:start position:0%
yeah it's challenging but you I could I
 
01:12:13.490 --> 01:12:13.500 align:start position:0%
I don't I don't think I could do it
 
01:12:13.500 --> 01:12:14.330 align:start position:0%
I don't I don't think I could do it
today

01:12:14.330 --> 01:12:14.340 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:12:16.970 --> 01:12:16.980 align:start position:0%
I honestly believe that now I teach at
 
01:12:19.850 --> 01:12:19.860 align:start position:0%
the college level I teach at city it's
 
01:12:21.890 --> 01:12:21.900 align:start position:0%
over but I don't I don't know if I could
 
01:12:24.290 --> 01:12:24.300 align:start position:0%
go back to high school give it given
 
01:12:26.689 --> 01:12:26.699 align:start position:0%
what's going on
 
01:12:29.149 --> 01:12:29.159 align:start position:0%
things kind of improve
 
01:12:29.159 --> 01:12:31.010 align:start position:0%
things kind of improve
it

01:12:31.010 --> 01:12:31.020 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:12:32.450 --> 01:12:32.460 align:start position:0%
I mean look at what happened at
 
01:12:34.970 --> 01:12:34.980 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth yet of deviating but look
 
01:12:36.410 --> 01:12:36.420 align:start position:0%
what happened in Portsmouth yesterday I
 
01:12:37.850 --> 01:12:37.860 align:start position:0%
got two grandchild
 
01:12:40.010 --> 01:12:40.020 align:start position:0%
in school enforcement
 
01:12:42.470 --> 01:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
at 10 o'clock the night before that
 
01:12:44.030 --> 01:12:44.040 align:start position:0%
college school off the next day because
 
01:12:47.090 --> 01:12:47.100 align:start position:0%
one of the kids was to kill the assessed
 
01:12:49.850 --> 01:12:49.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:53.270 --> 01:12:53.280 align:start position:0%
what do you tell your kids about that
 
01:12:56.030 --> 01:12:56.040 align:start position:0%
about that situation and they apprehend
 
01:12:59.149 --> 01:12:59.159 align:start position:0%
the kid who was the perpetrator of this
 
01:13:00.709 --> 01:13:00.719 align:start position:0%
it's a
 
01:13:03.350 --> 01:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
but we the best we didn't face things
 
01:13:06.290 --> 01:13:06.300 align:start position:0%
like that and we did
 
01:13:08.990 --> 01:13:09.000 align:start position:0%
a kid in high school when I was when I
 
01:13:11.330 --> 01:13:11.340 align:start position:0%
was teaching it's a was the light bus
 
01:13:14.149 --> 01:13:14.159 align:start position:0%
going to be there to take the kids who
 
01:13:16.310 --> 01:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
were participating in athletics and give
 
01:13:18.530 --> 01:13:18.540 align:start position:0%
them give up their ride home at night
 
01:13:21.169 --> 01:13:21.179 align:start position:0%
different worlds did you have it you
 
01:13:22.970 --> 01:13:22.980 align:start position:0%
have your challenges
 
01:13:25.189 --> 01:13:25.199 align:start position:0%
um it
 
01:13:30.770 --> 01:13:30.780 align:start position:0%
so it's not I subscribe good luck
 
01:13:30.780 --> 01:13:31.910 align:start position:0%
so it's not I subscribe good luck
it

01:13:31.910 --> 01:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:13:35.270 --> 01:13:35.280 align:start position:0%
I've got you know Bridge audited
 
01:13:38.030 --> 01:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
still at school the
 
01:13:40.189 --> 01:13:40.199 align:start position:0%
little bit challenging but one thing
 
01:13:42.649 --> 01:13:42.659 align:start position:0%
that that would have one of one of my
 
01:13:45.410 --> 01:13:45.420 align:start position:0%
grandchild got involved in is the model
 
01:13:48.350 --> 01:13:48.360 align:start position:0%
you went and that seems that that was I
 
01:13:50.030 --> 01:13:50.040 align:start position:0%
thought that was great and he's only a
 
01:13:51.350 --> 01:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
ninth grader
 
01:13:54.169 --> 01:13:54.179 align:start position:0%
so he's he's in that and he's in the
 
01:13:56.870 --> 01:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
debating Society they have that code
 
01:14:00.050 --> 01:14:00.060 align:start position:0%
where are they doing that now okay
 
01:14:03.290 --> 01:14:03.300 align:start position:0%
so I think those are things into the do
 
01:14:06.890 --> 01:14:06.900 align:start position:0%
to do worlds and it helps
 
01:14:08.750 --> 01:14:08.760 align:start position:0%
dude you want to take a little bit here
 
01:14:11.390 --> 01:14:11.400 align:start position:0%
and talk about your the civics
 
01:14:11.400 --> 01:14:12.790 align:start position:0%
and talk about your the civics
yeah

01:14:12.790 --> 01:14:12.800 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:14:16.490 --> 01:14:16.500 align:start position:0%
thank you uh chairman I
 
01:14:18.850 --> 01:14:18.860 align:start position:0%
so I I
 
01:14:27.530 --> 01:14:27.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:31.850 --> 01:14:31.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:34.189 --> 01:14:34.199 align:start position:0%
ooh we're not uh raising means are you
 
01:14:36.290 --> 01:14:36.300 align:start position:0%
looking for education
 
01:14:37.669 --> 01:14:37.679 align:start position:0%
this is
 
01:14:37.679 --> 01:14:40.570 align:start position:0%
this is
um

01:14:40.570 --> 01:14:40.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:42.830 --> 01:14:42.840 align:start position:0%
I would suggest
 
01:14:42.840 --> 01:14:45.169 align:start position:0%
I would suggest
um

01:14:45.169 --> 01:14:45.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:47.870 --> 01:14:47.880 align:start position:0%
all the officer probably not lit up but
 
01:14:50.510 --> 01:14:50.520 align:start position:0%
you go down the hallway uh there's a
 
01:14:52.310 --> 01:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
smaller office it's usually on either
 
01:14:54.470 --> 01:14:54.480 align:start position:0%
side where you can see an administrative
 
01:14:56.750 --> 01:14:56.760 align:start position:0%
assistant in there maybe you can gear
 
01:14:58.850 --> 01:14:58.860 align:start position:0%
you towards Ways and Means because that
 
01:15:00.430 --> 01:15:00.440 align:start position:0%
this is education
 
01:15:07.450 --> 01:15:07.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:09.770 --> 01:15:09.780 align:start position:0%
there is also something going on at the
 
01:15:11.510 --> 01:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
end of the hallway too all the way at
 
01:15:13.310 --> 01:15:13.320 align:start position:0%
the end
 
01:15:14.810 --> 01:15:14.820 align:start position:0%
it suits us
 
01:15:18.169 --> 01:15:18.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:20.930 --> 01:15:20.940 align:start position:0%
oh that that's a caucus Okay so
 
01:15:22.610 --> 01:15:22.620 align:start position:0%
you don't want to go in there
 
01:15:22.620 --> 01:15:25.209 align:start position:0%
you don't want to go in there
yeah

01:15:25.209 --> 01:15:25.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:28.209 --> 01:15:28.219 align:start position:0%
so thank you uh
 
01:15:31.490 --> 01:15:31.500 align:start position:0%
I'm going to make a leap that the the
 
01:15:34.250 --> 01:15:34.260 align:start position:0%
bill that representative Ladd has shared
 
01:15:39.229 --> 01:15:39.239 align:start position:0%
with you is going to pass uh uh Hope
 
01:15:42.110 --> 01:15:42.120 align:start position:0%
Springs Eternal and
 
01:15:46.910 --> 01:15:46.920 align:start position:0%
uh that that Civics education is is
 
01:15:49.310 --> 01:15:49.320 align:start position:0%
something that the public is really
 
01:15:52.490 --> 01:15:52.500 align:start position:0%
interested in students having greater
 
01:15:56.930 --> 01:15:56.940 align:start position:0%
exposure so in in looking you know in
 
01:16:00.550 --> 01:16:00.560 align:start position:0%
the universe of what is available
 
01:16:04.070 --> 01:16:04.080 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of course material out in
 
01:16:06.649 --> 01:16:06.659 align:start position:0%
the field uh where people put together
 
01:16:09.709 --> 01:16:09.719 align:start position:0%
sequences of learning
 
01:16:09.719 --> 01:16:11.149 align:start position:0%
sequences of learning
lessons

01:16:11.149 --> 01:16:11.159 align:start position:0%
lessons
 
01:16:13.790 --> 01:16:13.800 align:start position:0%
so I'm curious with your teacher
 
01:16:15.350 --> 01:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
training programs
 
01:16:18.590 --> 01:16:18.600 align:start position:0%
where there is this universe of
 
01:16:18.600 --> 01:16:20.330 align:start position:0%
where there is this universe of
materials

01:16:20.330 --> 01:16:20.340 align:start position:0%
materials
 
01:16:23.390 --> 01:16:23.400 align:start position:0%
but perhaps unvetted at least by
 
01:16:25.729 --> 01:16:25.739 align:start position:0%
teachers and it's a little hard while
 
01:16:28.070 --> 01:16:28.080 align:start position:0%
you're flying the plane to read the
 
01:16:30.110 --> 01:16:30.120 align:start position:0%
instruction manual
 
01:16:30.120 --> 01:16:32.090 align:start position:0%
instruction manual
um

01:16:32.090 --> 01:16:32.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:36.890 --> 01:16:36.900 align:start position:0%
something that that is uh
 
01:16:40.750 --> 01:16:40.760 align:start position:0%
within your curriculum to look into
 
01:16:44.530 --> 01:16:44.540 align:start position:0%
these modules that have been produced
 
01:16:47.590 --> 01:16:47.600 align:start position:0%
and to critique them
 
01:16:50.870 --> 01:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
and to have those kinds of discussions
 
01:16:54.770 --> 01:16:54.780 align:start position:0%
in a classroom so that as students begin
 
01:16:57.649 --> 01:16:57.659 align:start position:0%
to go out into the field in this
 
01:17:00.410 --> 01:17:00.420 align:start position:0%
multi-disciplinary kind of method of
 
01:17:04.370 --> 01:17:04.380 align:start position:0%
language arts and social studies begin
 
01:17:08.090 --> 01:17:08.100 align:start position:0%
to then say hey look at this one you
 
01:17:12.290 --> 01:17:12.300 align:start position:0%
know I mean that that they are become a
 
01:17:14.750 --> 01:17:14.760 align:start position:0%
little bit more of a subject matter or
 
01:17:18.229 --> 01:17:18.239 align:start position:0%
expert and consultant to teachers not
 
01:17:28.510 --> 01:17:28.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:31.430 --> 01:17:31.440 align:start position:0%
so thank you I I guess the first I want
 
01:17:34.130 --> 01:17:34.140 align:start position:0%
to be clear on our social studies they
 
01:17:35.990 --> 01:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
do a lot with like the grades five
 
01:17:38.090 --> 01:17:38.100 align:start position:0%
through twelve like the program the
 
01:17:39.709 --> 01:17:39.719 align:start position:0%
social studies specific content who
 
01:17:41.390 --> 01:17:41.400 align:start position:0%
would become in social studies I don't
 
01:17:42.530 --> 01:17:42.540 align:start position:0%
think you're asking about that it sounds
 
01:17:43.729 --> 01:17:43.739 align:start position:0%
like you want to know more about
 
01:17:46.189 --> 01:17:46.199 align:start position:0%
elementary education specifically and
 
01:17:50.630 --> 01:17:50.640 align:start position:0%
the bill is quite particular I mean what
 
01:17:53.090 --> 01:17:53.100 align:start position:0%
it's trying to do is fit into what the
 
01:17:54.890 --> 01:17:54.900 align:start position:0%
requirements currently are the occur
 
01:17:57.350 --> 01:17:57.360 align:start position:0%
we've got a high school requirement
 
01:18:02.570 --> 01:18:02.580 align:start position:0%
without a a Grade School uh lift to uh
 
01:18:04.850 --> 01:18:04.860 align:start position:0%
facts and knowledge so this is trying to
 
01:18:08.630 --> 01:18:08.640 align:start position:0%
to create that that Learning Tree
 
01:18:11.990 --> 01:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
so I would maybe personally but I well
 
01:18:13.669 --> 01:18:13.679 align:start position:0%
even our I know social studies faculty
 
01:18:15.770 --> 01:18:15.780 align:start position:0%
they think this is a great idea you know
 
01:18:17.209 --> 01:18:17.219 align:start position:0%
in terms of because I think that's one
 
01:18:18.890 --> 01:18:18.900 align:start position:0%
of the struggles is right is how do you
 
01:18:20.270 --> 01:18:20.280 align:start position:0%
teach some of this content at seventh
 
01:18:21.590 --> 01:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
and 8th grade or ninth grade if they
 
01:18:23.330 --> 01:18:23.340 align:start position:0%
really haven't had it much prior to
 
01:18:26.090 --> 01:18:26.100 align:start position:0%
right so having Civics having that
 
01:18:27.830 --> 01:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
earlier on
 
01:18:30.350 --> 01:18:30.360 align:start position:0%
um so I think it's great and I hope it
 
01:18:31.430 --> 01:18:31.440 align:start position:0%
does pass
 
01:18:34.550 --> 01:18:34.560 align:start position:0%
um as uh going forward
 
01:18:36.890 --> 01:18:36.900 align:start position:0%
um and I I think that you know it's
 
01:18:38.750 --> 01:18:38.760 align:start position:0%
something that
 
01:18:41.270 --> 01:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
um at least for Plymouth I think we're
 
01:18:43.130 --> 01:18:43.140 align:start position:0%
work with is happening with our
 
01:18:44.689 --> 01:18:44.699 align:start position:0%
elementary education program but I think
 
01:18:47.030 --> 01:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
even you know with this I think would
 
01:18:49.970 --> 01:18:49.980 align:start position:0%
just become another step in terms of
 
01:18:52.430 --> 01:18:52.440 align:start position:0%
um even in implement it even more is
 
01:18:52.440 --> 01:18:53.630 align:start position:0%
um even in implement it even more is
possible

01:18:53.630 --> 01:18:53.640 align:start position:0%
possible
 
01:18:55.310 --> 01:18:55.320 align:start position:0%
um and then taking a look at the you
 
01:18:57.709 --> 01:18:57.719 align:start position:0%
know what is available I can't speak I
 
01:19:00.229 --> 01:19:00.239 align:start position:0%
can you know are not the subject matter
 
01:19:02.030 --> 01:19:02.040 align:start position:0%
content area for social studies at the
 
01:19:04.189 --> 01:19:04.199 align:start position:0%
elementary that's a colleague
 
01:19:06.470 --> 01:19:06.480 align:start position:0%
um you know and that she could speak
 
01:19:08.390 --> 01:19:08.400 align:start position:0%
more clearly or specifically to certain
 
01:19:09.649 --> 01:19:09.659 align:start position:0%
modules and what would be the best way
 
01:19:11.390 --> 01:19:11.400 align:start position:0%
to do it and probably be happy to start
 
01:19:14.209 --> 01:19:14.219 align:start position:0%
betting that as well
 
01:19:16.430 --> 01:19:16.440 align:start position:0%
um I would just add to that that um
 
01:19:18.350 --> 01:19:18.360 align:start position:0%
I always worry when there's modules and
 
01:19:20.149 --> 01:19:20.159 align:start position:0%
curriculums because
 
01:19:22.189 --> 01:19:22.199 align:start position:0%
um you don't know who's creating them or
 
01:19:24.530 --> 01:19:24.540 align:start position:0%
who's putting them out there but when I
 
01:19:27.050 --> 01:19:27.060 align:start position:0%
think of Elementary and um you know and
 
01:19:28.550 --> 01:19:28.560 align:start position:0%
I read through the bill and we had a
 
01:19:30.169 --> 01:19:30.179 align:start position:0%
great chance to talk about it so it got
 
01:19:31.669 --> 01:19:31.679 align:start position:0%
me thinking about it
 
01:19:34.610 --> 01:19:34.620 align:start position:0%
is really at the elementary it's not
 
01:19:36.950 --> 01:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
just only the content but it's teaching
 
01:19:40.390 --> 01:19:40.400 align:start position:0%
skills it's teaching students how to
 
01:19:42.770 --> 01:19:42.780 align:start position:0%
have conversations where you're
 
01:19:45.350 --> 01:19:45.360 align:start position:0%
listening to all the voices and not just
 
01:19:47.689 --> 01:19:47.699 align:start position:0%
saying my what I think is right is
 
01:19:49.850 --> 01:19:49.860 align:start position:0%
teaching children how to be critical
 
01:19:52.310 --> 01:19:52.320 align:start position:0%
thinkers is teaching the children how to
 
01:19:54.830 --> 01:19:54.840 align:start position:0%
do creative inquiry to say well I wonder
 
01:19:57.410 --> 01:19:57.420 align:start position:0%
about this how do I find and how do I
 
01:19:59.810 --> 01:19:59.820 align:start position:0%
know what I'm looking is actually a good
 
01:20:02.149 --> 01:20:02.159 align:start position:0%
source you know it's teaching students
 
01:20:04.310 --> 01:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
that there's things that we hear from
 
01:20:06.169 --> 01:20:06.179 align:start position:0%
the community or on the news or from
 
01:20:08.750 --> 01:20:08.760 align:start position:0%
family and that our job is to kind of
 
01:20:10.669 --> 01:20:10.679 align:start position:0%
figure out is this what I believe or do
 
01:20:13.850 --> 01:20:13.860 align:start position:0%
I just keep saying what I hear and we do
 
01:20:15.050 --> 01:20:15.060 align:start position:0%
this and if we start this in elementary
 
01:20:16.850 --> 01:20:16.860 align:start position:0%
imagine how much easier it would be to
 
01:20:18.530 --> 01:20:18.540 align:start position:0%
have these conversations with students
 
01:20:21.410 --> 01:20:21.420 align:start position:0%
in college but how do we teach students
 
01:20:23.870 --> 01:20:23.880 align:start position:0%
that when we decide things that we
 
01:20:26.689 --> 01:20:26.699 align:start position:0%
decide as a community and why do votes
 
01:20:29.030 --> 01:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
and voices matter and how does this play
 
01:20:31.310 --> 01:20:31.320 align:start position:0%
into the larger scheme and then why is
 
01:20:32.689 --> 01:20:32.699 align:start position:0%
it important important for me to make
 
01:20:36.050 --> 01:20:36.060 align:start position:0%
sure my voice is heard and and not just
 
01:20:37.610 --> 01:20:37.620 align:start position:0%
sitting there saying oh why are they
 
01:20:39.830 --> 01:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
doing this I think there's a lot of
 
01:20:42.169 --> 01:20:42.179 align:start position:0%
skills that we could teach students at
 
01:20:43.970 --> 01:20:43.980 align:start position:0%
the elementary level that would really
 
01:20:46.970 --> 01:20:46.980 align:start position:0%
prepare them not just in the content but
 
01:20:49.790 --> 01:20:49.800 align:start position:0%
being able to engage with these courses
 
01:20:52.130 --> 01:20:52.140 align:start position:0%
when they are and especially
 
01:20:53.450 --> 01:20:53.460 align:start position:0%
specifically you know what you're
 
01:20:54.709 --> 01:20:54.719 align:start position:0%
talking about here for middle and high
 
01:20:56.330 --> 01:20:56.340 align:start position:0%
school then they are mature enough and
 
01:20:57.649 --> 01:20:57.659 align:start position:0%
understand the world a little bit more
 
01:20:59.630 --> 01:20:59.640 align:start position:0%
and they're ready to engage in those
 
01:21:02.570 --> 01:21:02.580 align:start position:0%
that learning process those are things
 
01:21:04.370 --> 01:21:04.380 align:start position:0%
that I don't always think modules think
 
01:21:06.649 --> 01:21:06.659 align:start position:0%
about and I even had a student
 
01:21:08.870 --> 01:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
I was teaching the literacy course and
 
01:21:11.689 --> 01:21:11.699 align:start position:0%
she she was like I'm sorry to ask you a
 
01:21:13.910 --> 01:21:13.920 align:start position:0%
side question but you know I had the
 
01:21:16.130 --> 01:21:16.140 align:start position:0%
students he kept saying you know you
 
01:21:17.930 --> 01:21:17.940 align:start position:0%
know bringing up oh Trump this Trump
 
01:21:20.209 --> 01:21:20.219 align:start position:0%
that and then the teacher responded and
 
01:21:21.770 --> 01:21:21.780 align:start position:0%
got in trouble with how she responded
 
01:21:23.630 --> 01:21:23.640 align:start position:0%
and she said what would you have done I
 
01:21:25.729 --> 01:21:25.739 align:start position:0%
said don't make it political
 
01:21:28.729 --> 01:21:28.739 align:start position:0%
why is politics brought you know the
 
01:21:30.410 --> 01:21:30.420 align:start position:0%
political divide brought into the
 
01:21:31.850 --> 01:21:31.860 align:start position:0%
classroom let's talk about critical
 
01:21:33.530 --> 01:21:33.540 align:start position:0%
thinking let's talking about knowing
 
01:21:35.870 --> 01:21:35.880 align:start position:0%
your sources that's talking about okay
 
01:21:37.550 --> 01:21:37.560 align:start position:0%
you believe this and somebody believes
 
01:21:39.410 --> 01:21:39.420 align:start position:0%
that as you know is one better than the
 
01:21:41.750 --> 01:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
other no but let's listen and then we
 
01:21:44.090 --> 01:21:44.100 align:start position:0%
can learn how do we create an open space
 
01:21:46.729 --> 01:21:46.739 align:start position:0%
for a dialogue can happen and she was
 
01:21:49.370 --> 01:21:49.380 align:start position:0%
like oh that that would have been a much
 
01:21:51.530 --> 01:21:51.540 align:start position:0%
better approach and so that's where
 
01:21:53.810 --> 01:21:53.820 align:start position:0%
those conversations happen and if we can
 
01:21:56.270 --> 01:21:56.280 align:start position:0%
do it in teacher Ed imagine if they
 
01:21:57.709 --> 01:21:57.719 align:start position:0%
they're the ones going in the classroom
 
01:21:59.689 --> 01:21:59.699 align:start position:0%
what might happen in the classroom and I
 
01:22:00.830 --> 01:22:00.840 align:start position:0%
think that's the only thing I think the
 
01:22:02.810 --> 01:22:02.820 align:start position:0%
idea specific education I agree with you
 
01:22:04.790 --> 01:22:04.800 align:start position:0%
is really important because we're
 
01:22:06.350 --> 01:22:06.360 align:start position:0%
preparing Global Citizens We're
 
01:22:09.110 --> 01:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
preparing students who are ready to
 
01:22:11.149 --> 01:22:11.159 align:start position:0%
enter the world be part of The Voice
 
01:22:13.610 --> 01:22:13.620 align:start position:0%
have thoughts know how to critically
 
01:22:16.610 --> 01:22:16.620 align:start position:0%
think how to find the information but to
 
01:22:18.410 --> 01:22:18.420 align:start position:0%
do it we need to find ways that it's
 
01:22:20.090 --> 01:22:20.100 align:start position:0%
scaffold so it's developmentally
 
01:22:20.100 --> 01:22:21.770 align:start position:0%
scaffold so it's developmentally
appropriate

01:22:21.770 --> 01:22:21.780 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
01:22:24.890 --> 01:22:24.900 align:start position:0%
sorry that was my teacher I'd say
 
01:22:28.010 --> 01:22:28.020 align:start position:0%
good it's good to hear it
 
01:22:31.729 --> 01:22:31.739 align:start position:0%
um I made up two possible changes uh on
 
01:22:33.530 --> 01:22:33.540 align:start position:0%
this I like to just kind of if we could
 
01:22:35.149 --> 01:22:35.159 align:start position:0%
because you're here Jay and I know
 
01:22:38.090 --> 01:22:38.100 align:start position:0%
you're very involved with this yes he
 
01:22:38.100 --> 01:22:40.430 align:start position:0%
you're very involved with this yes he
does

01:22:40.430 --> 01:22:40.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:43.910 --> 01:22:43.920 align:start position:0%
um first of all uh on on page one we're
 
01:22:46.490 --> 01:22:46.500 align:start position:0%
talking about courses or course of
 
01:22:46.500 --> 01:22:47.750 align:start position:0%
talking about courses or course of
instruction

01:22:47.750 --> 01:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
instruction
 
01:22:50.450 --> 01:22:50.460 align:start position:0%
and the Old Law which we have or the
 
01:22:55.010 --> 01:22:55.020 align:start position:0%
current law says uh one credit or one
 
01:22:58.250 --> 01:22:58.260 align:start position:0%
half Credit in the two that we have we
 
01:23:00.290 --> 01:23:00.300 align:start position:0%
have a a one credit course instruction
 
01:23:02.149 --> 01:23:02.159 align:start position:0%
required for high school graduation in
 
01:23:03.169 --> 01:23:03.179 align:start position:0%
the United States and New Hampshire
 
01:23:06.169 --> 01:23:06.179 align:start position:0%
history and one half credit course of
 
01:23:07.610 --> 01:23:07.620 align:start position:0%
instruction required for high school
 
01:23:10.669 --> 01:23:10.679 align:start position:0%
graduation in the United States and New
 
01:23:13.130 --> 01:23:13.140 align:start position:0%
Hampshire government and Civics
 
01:23:16.189 --> 01:23:16.199 align:start position:0%
um the bill as it's constructed doesn't
 
01:23:18.950 --> 01:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
mention the word credit
 
01:23:22.130 --> 01:23:22.140 align:start position:0%
um it talks about a year for a half year
 
01:23:25.550 --> 01:23:25.560 align:start position:0%
are we wise and dropping out the credit
 
01:23:28.550 --> 01:23:28.560 align:start position:0%
requirement which is you know basically
 
01:23:33.110 --> 01:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
reflected in our education rules 306.
 
01:23:36.530 --> 01:23:36.540 align:start position:0%
uh well I I think I think you're
 
01:23:39.470 --> 01:23:39.480 align:start position:0%
you make a good observation we do talk
 
01:23:42.110 --> 01:23:42.120 align:start position:0%
in terms of credits we know that
 
01:23:45.110 --> 01:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
students have a graduation requirement
 
01:23:48.169 --> 01:23:48.179 align:start position:0%
it's minimally 22 credits in order to
 
01:23:51.770 --> 01:23:51.780 align:start position:0%
graduate high school 20. uh and maybe in
 
01:23:54.350 --> 01:23:54.360 align:start position:0%
other schools is 22. yeah it's 25th or
 
01:23:57.310 --> 01:23:57.320 align:start position:0%
something that has 27.
 
01:23:59.750 --> 01:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
it's different around the state but
 
01:24:04.310 --> 01:24:04.320 align:start position:0%
right okay 20. uh anyway I I think that
 
01:24:08.030 --> 01:24:08.040 align:start position:0%
is the unit of measurement that 306
 
01:24:10.370 --> 01:24:10.380 align:start position:0%
makes reference to I understand why
 
01:24:12.530 --> 01:24:12.540 align:start position:0%
you're why you change it well I'm not
 
01:24:14.149 --> 01:24:14.159 align:start position:0%
trying to change and trying to retain it
 
01:24:15.830 --> 01:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
I don't want to see social studies
 
01:24:15.840 --> 01:24:16.990 align:start position:0%
I don't want to see social studies
disappear

01:24:16.990 --> 01:24:17.000 align:start position:0%
disappear
 
01:24:20.450 --> 01:24:20.460 align:start position:0%
from the graduation requirements yes and
 
01:24:22.430 --> 01:24:22.440 align:start position:0%
it's ought to be a full
 
01:24:24.649 --> 01:24:24.659 align:start position:0%
credit okay
 
01:24:27.169 --> 01:24:27.179 align:start position:0%
then then I I have a question on the
 
01:24:29.870 --> 01:24:29.880 align:start position:0%
bottom there where it says a minus 35 36
 
01:24:33.709 --> 01:24:33.719 align:start position:0%
37 on page one dedically a dedicated
 
01:24:36.590 --> 01:24:36.600 align:start position:0%
class time for civics instruction I put
 
01:24:39.950 --> 01:24:39.960 align:start position:0%
instruction there either way for civics
 
01:24:43.729 --> 01:24:43.739 align:start position:0%
in each Elementary grade which can be
 
01:24:46.189 --> 01:24:46.199 align:start position:0%
integrated with other subjects the way
 
01:24:48.410 --> 01:24:48.420 align:start position:0%
it that the the bills come from the
 
01:24:48.420 --> 01:24:49.790 align:start position:0%
it that the the bills come from the
Senate

01:24:49.790 --> 01:24:49.800 align:start position:0%
Senate
 
01:24:52.370 --> 01:24:52.380 align:start position:0%
it should be shall be taught as part of
 
01:24:53.990 --> 01:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
social studies are integrated with other
 
01:24:56.689 --> 01:24:56.699 align:start position:0%
subjects so it shall occur rather than
 
01:24:56.699 --> 01:24:58.610 align:start position:0%
subjects so it shall occur rather than
can

01:24:58.610 --> 01:24:58.620 align:start position:0%
can
 
01:25:01.010 --> 01:25:01.020 align:start position:0%
we we fight over little words here but
 
01:25:02.570 --> 01:25:02.580 align:start position:0%
they mean a lot
 
01:25:02.580 --> 01:25:04.610 align:start position:0%
they mean a lot
yeah

01:25:04.610 --> 01:25:04.620 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:25:06.470 --> 01:25:06.480 align:start position:0%
I felt more comfortable with saying it
 
01:25:08.209 --> 01:25:08.219 align:start position:0%
shall be done
 
01:25:11.870 --> 01:25:11.880 align:start position:0%
you can't back off from it um
 
01:25:14.750 --> 01:25:14.760 align:start position:0%
the the other areas
 
01:25:18.229 --> 01:25:18.239 align:start position:0%
um are more you know this Rick lad
 
01:25:20.030 --> 01:25:20.040 align:start position:0%
speaking and and that's you know I'm
 
01:25:23.810 --> 01:25:23.820 align:start position:0%
just but I I put on line three on page
 
01:25:25.850 --> 01:25:25.860 align:start position:0%
two a half year credit course of
 
01:25:28.250 --> 01:25:28.260 align:start position:0%
instruction Civics in high school
 
01:25:31.130 --> 01:25:31.140 align:start position:0%
required that's the discussion we just
 
01:25:33.410 --> 01:25:33.420 align:start position:0%
had so it doesn't change the intent of
 
01:25:35.689 --> 01:25:35.699 align:start position:0%
the bill at all
 
01:25:38.870 --> 01:25:38.880 align:start position:0%
um I think the the line five me I don't
 
01:25:41.030 --> 01:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
know if this does or not in this section
 
01:25:44.270 --> 01:25:44.280 align:start position:0%
Civics means a nonpartisan education
 
01:25:47.810 --> 01:25:47.820 align:start position:0%
program that addresses the following and
 
01:25:51.350 --> 01:25:51.360 align:start position:0%
then you have those a through d
 
01:25:53.990 --> 01:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
which you know tried to Define what it
 
01:25:58.010 --> 01:25:58.020 align:start position:0%
means uh would it be a little bit uh
 
01:26:00.649 --> 01:26:00.659 align:start position:0%
sharper or you know saying education Pro
 
01:26:02.209 --> 01:26:02.219 align:start position:0%
committed to the fundamental
 
01:26:03.709 --> 01:26:03.719 align:start position:0%
responsibilities and principles of
 
01:26:06.890 --> 01:26:06.900 align:start position:0%
American constitutional democracy that
 
01:26:09.350 --> 01:26:09.360 align:start position:0%
addresses the following
 
01:26:11.450 --> 01:26:11.460 align:start position:0%
I don't know if that puts too much in
 
01:26:15.410 --> 01:26:15.420 align:start position:0%
there or or or it takes takes away if
 
01:26:18.110 --> 01:26:18.120 align:start position:0%
ads deletes
 
01:26:21.470 --> 01:26:21.480 align:start position:0%
offered for for a consideration I'm not
 
01:26:23.270 --> 01:26:23.280 align:start position:0%
asking for somebody to respond right now
 
01:26:26.990 --> 01:26:27.000 align:start position:0%
but if your thoughts are invited and
 
01:26:29.390 --> 01:26:29.400 align:start position:0%
then then line 15
 
01:26:31.669 --> 01:26:31.679 align:start position:0%
I was trying to recall what I've heard a
 
01:26:33.290 --> 01:26:33.300 align:start position:0%
little bit about some of the teaching of
 
01:26:35.810 --> 01:26:35.820 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and Civics and in our
 
01:26:37.490 --> 01:26:37.500 align:start position:0%
government of New Hampshire
 
01:26:39.709 --> 01:26:39.719 align:start position:0%
an appreciation for free speech and
 
01:26:41.750 --> 01:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
civil discourse using historical
 
01:26:44.450 --> 01:26:44.460 align:start position:0%
references such as how many people know
 
01:26:46.310 --> 01:26:46.320 align:start position:0%
the first constitution in America was
 
01:26:49.129 --> 01:26:49.139 align:start position:0%
right here in this state
 
01:26:51.470 --> 01:26:51.480 align:start position:0%
it was the Pioneer constitution of
 
01:26:53.689 --> 01:26:53.699 align:start position:0%
January 5 1776.
 
01:26:58.129 --> 01:26:58.139 align:start position:0%
and it was really hotly debated
 
01:26:58.139 --> 01:26:59.030 align:start position:0%
and it was really hotly debated
um

01:26:59.030 --> 01:26:59.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:03.290 --> 01:27:03.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:06.950 --> 01:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
um in in on line 21
 
01:27:09.830 --> 01:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
where it says a school district shall
 
01:27:11.330 --> 01:27:11.340 align:start position:0%
develop an offer the United States of
 
01:27:13.430 --> 01:27:13.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire now we took out government
 
01:27:16.790 --> 01:27:16.800 align:start position:0%
Civics but that came out from the first
 
01:27:19.970 --> 01:27:19.980 align:start position:0%
paragraph on on page one there under
 
01:27:22.310 --> 01:27:22.320 align:start position:0%
item one Roman one
 
01:27:26.870 --> 01:27:26.880 align:start position:0%
where we're talking about the history
 
01:27:26.880 --> 01:27:28.610 align:start position:0%
where we're talking about the history
um

01:27:28.610 --> 01:27:28.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:30.830 --> 01:27:30.840 align:start position:0%
and we're talking government
 
01:27:32.510 --> 01:27:32.520 align:start position:0%
in the Constitutions of the United
 
01:27:34.610 --> 01:27:34.620 align:start position:0%
States New Hampshire
 
01:27:37.430 --> 01:27:37.440 align:start position:0%
as part of that course
 
01:27:39.649 --> 01:27:39.659 align:start position:0%
so I was curious to know whether we
 
01:27:41.810 --> 01:27:41.820 align:start position:0%
should be also on 1C a school district
 
01:27:43.189 --> 01:27:43.199 align:start position:0%
shall develop and offer the United
 
01:27:44.390 --> 01:27:44.400 align:start position:0%
States and New Hampshire history
 
01:27:46.010 --> 01:27:46.020 align:start position:0%
government and Constitution the United
 
01:27:47.750 --> 01:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
States and New Hampshire
 
01:27:51.470 --> 01:27:51.480 align:start position:0%
one year credit course under paragraph
 
01:27:54.169 --> 01:27:54.179 align:start position:0%
one see this reflects back to paragraph
 
01:27:54.179 --> 01:27:55.430 align:start position:0%
one see this reflects back to paragraph
one

01:27:55.430 --> 01:27:55.440 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:27:57.709 --> 01:27:57.719 align:start position:0%
and some of that never came forward the
 
01:27:59.450 --> 01:27:59.460 align:start position:0%
history never came forward
 
01:28:01.430 --> 01:28:01.440 align:start position:0%
so we took history out of the law
 
01:28:01.440 --> 01:28:02.990 align:start position:0%
so we took history out of the law
totally

01:28:02.990 --> 01:28:03.000 align:start position:0%
totally
 
01:28:06.530 --> 01:28:06.540 align:start position:0%
other than a regular course
 
01:28:09.110 --> 01:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
which is the first sentence there on one
 
01:28:11.990 --> 01:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
it took all that other meat out down
 
01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:13.970 align:start position:0%
it took all that other meat out down
below

01:28:13.970 --> 01:28:13.980 align:start position:0%
below
 
01:28:17.390 --> 01:28:17.400 align:start position:0%
those are the only changes I put in
 
01:28:17.400 --> 01:28:21.709 align:start position:0%
those are the only changes I put in
um

01:28:21.709 --> 01:28:21.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:25.910 --> 01:28:25.920 align:start position:0%
and and basically to that at all I think
 
01:28:28.910 --> 01:28:28.920 align:start position:0%
we need the bill absolutely
 
01:28:28.920 --> 01:28:30.169 align:start position:0%
we need the bill absolutely
um

01:28:30.169 --> 01:28:30.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:33.110 --> 01:28:33.120 align:start position:0%
I hope we can get it passed but I'm just
 
01:28:35.330 --> 01:28:35.340 align:start position:0%
asking if there's any
 
01:28:38.629 --> 01:28:38.639 align:start position:0%
you know support or criticism or
 
01:28:41.330 --> 01:28:41.340 align:start position:0%
regarding some of those possible changes
 
01:28:43.250 --> 01:28:43.260 align:start position:0%
and they're certainly come out of the
 
01:28:44.689 --> 01:28:44.699 align:start position:0%
education committee when we have that
 
01:28:47.450 --> 01:28:47.460 align:start position:0%
but coming with higher education people
 
01:28:49.790 --> 01:28:49.800 align:start position:0%
here you know I'd be curious know any
 
01:28:49.800 --> 01:28:52.070 align:start position:0%
here you know I'd be curious know any
thoughts

01:28:52.070 --> 01:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
thoughts
 
01:28:53.689 --> 01:28:53.699 align:start position:0%
yes Dave
 
01:28:55.910 --> 01:28:55.920 align:start position:0%
Rick thanks and I think I think a lot of
 
01:28:57.830 --> 01:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
these a lot of your suggestions here
 
01:29:00.530 --> 01:29:00.540 align:start position:0%
have uh have some Merit to them and I
 
01:29:02.450 --> 01:29:02.460 align:start position:0%
think worthy of discussion I think the
 
01:29:05.629 --> 01:29:05.639 align:start position:0%
the one that that that I'm not following
 
01:29:07.750 --> 01:29:07.760 align:start position:0%
so much is the one on page one line 25
 
01:29:11.390 --> 01:29:11.400 align:start position:0%
because I think I think paragraph one
 
01:29:14.270 --> 01:29:14.280 align:start position:0%
there Roman one really sort of sets
 
01:29:16.430 --> 01:29:16.440 align:start position:0%
everything up for these half credit and
 
01:29:18.229 --> 01:29:18.239 align:start position:0%
full credit courses that are talked
 
01:29:20.810 --> 01:29:20.820 align:start position:0%
about in subsequent paragraphs
 
01:29:23.810 --> 01:29:23.820 align:start position:0%
um and I think the way it reads in the
 
01:29:26.629 --> 01:29:26.639 align:start position:0%
bill now there shall be given courses of
 
01:29:28.189 --> 01:29:28.199 align:start position:0%
instruction in the history government
 
01:29:30.770 --> 01:29:30.780 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:29:34.910 --> 01:29:34.920 align:start position:0%
um one a b and c talk about those
 
01:29:37.370 --> 01:29:37.380 align:start position:0%
courses some are half credit courses
 
01:29:39.950 --> 01:29:39.960 align:start position:0%
some are or half your courses some are
 
01:29:41.750 --> 01:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
full year courses but they're all
 
01:29:41.760 --> 01:29:43.129 align:start position:0%
full year courses but they're all
courses

01:29:43.129 --> 01:29:43.139 align:start position:0%
courses
 
01:29:45.350 --> 01:29:45.360 align:start position:0%
um they're not all yeah full year
 
01:29:45.360 --> 01:29:47.330 align:start position:0%
um they're not all yeah full year
courses

01:29:47.330 --> 01:29:47.340 align:start position:0%
courses
 
01:29:48.709 --> 01:29:48.719 align:start position:0%
well there's a lot of ways of teaching
 
01:29:50.629 --> 01:29:50.639 align:start position:0%
it too you know some schools do it
 
01:29:52.010 --> 01:29:52.020 align:start position:0%
through one course some do it through
 
01:29:53.990 --> 01:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
several different courses right but some
 
01:29:55.370 --> 01:29:55.380 align:start position:0%
integrate it all together but the
 
01:29:57.229 --> 01:29:57.239 align:start position:0%
graduation requirement right now is a
 
01:29:59.410 --> 01:29:59.420 align:start position:0%
half credit course at the high school
 
01:30:03.050 --> 01:30:03.060 align:start position:0%
now it's one and a half no the half
 
01:30:05.390 --> 01:30:05.400 align:start position:0%
credit course in civics
 
01:30:08.149 --> 01:30:08.159 align:start position:0%
well I don't have yeah for yes yes I
 
01:30:09.770 --> 01:30:09.780 align:start position:0%
think that's a that's a graduation
 
01:30:12.950 --> 01:30:12.960 align:start position:0%
requirement for services a half credit
 
01:30:16.490 --> 01:30:16.500 align:start position:0%
uh it's government and Civics isn't it
 
01:30:16.500 --> 01:30:17.169 align:start position:0%
uh it's government and Civics isn't it
um

01:30:17.169 --> 01:30:17.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:20.030 --> 01:30:20.040 align:start position:0%
it's government and civics
 
01:30:22.070 --> 01:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
see that we have Civics here we're
 
01:30:23.810 --> 01:30:23.820 align:start position:0%
taking government out
 
01:30:25.550 --> 01:30:25.560 align:start position:0%
and putting it up in the other course
 
01:30:27.709 --> 01:30:27.719 align:start position:0%
because government has to be taught oh
 
01:30:27.719 --> 01:30:29.750 align:start position:0%
because government has to be taught oh
absolutely

01:30:29.750 --> 01:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
01:30:31.310 --> 01:30:31.320 align:start position:0%
so there's going to be a lot of
 
01:30:33.290 --> 01:30:33.300 align:start position:0%
discussion on this but uh
 
01:30:36.110 --> 01:30:36.120 align:start position:0%
thoughts yes Dave
 
01:30:39.229 --> 01:30:39.239 align:start position:0%
um yeah I uh I support I support this
 
01:30:41.870 --> 01:30:41.880 align:start position:0%
but I want to ask a question of our
 
01:30:44.030 --> 01:30:44.040 align:start position:0%
field practitioners here
 
01:30:46.550 --> 01:30:46.560 align:start position:0%
uh we come up with a lot of great ideas
 
01:30:48.649 --> 01:30:48.659 align:start position:0%
in this legislature
 
01:30:50.870 --> 01:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
and then we passed them and we pass them
 
01:30:53.030 --> 01:30:53.040 align:start position:0%
down uh to those who have to implement
 
01:30:54.169 --> 01:30:54.179 align:start position:0%
this stuff
 
01:30:56.510 --> 01:30:56.520 align:start position:0%
and so the question I guess I really
 
01:30:58.490 --> 01:30:58.500 align:start position:0%
have it's a serious question is that as
 
01:31:00.950 --> 01:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
you as you implement this kind of thing
 
01:31:04.729 --> 01:31:04.739 align:start position:0%
it's one more it's one more uh issue
 
01:31:09.050 --> 01:31:09.060 align:start position:0%
that is given to folks like you to have
 
01:31:13.850 --> 01:31:13.860 align:start position:0%
to develop curriculum Etc I mean
 
01:31:16.129 --> 01:31:16.139 align:start position:0%
set this aside just for a moment this
 
01:31:19.550 --> 01:31:19.560 align:start position:0%
issue I mean how do you respond to the
 
01:31:22.189 --> 01:31:22.199 align:start position:0%
great ideas that we generate here in
 
01:31:25.490 --> 01:31:25.500 align:start position:0%
this hallowed Place uh and then all of a
 
01:31:28.430 --> 01:31:28.440 align:start position:0%
sudden say okay do it I mean what how do
 
01:31:31.430 --> 01:31:31.440 align:start position:0%
you receive this kind of stuff well a
 
01:31:33.770 --> 01:31:33.780 align:start position:0%
thank you for bringing us here now this
 
01:31:33.780 --> 01:31:34.790 align:start position:0%
thank you for bringing us here now this
helps

01:31:34.790 --> 01:31:34.800 align:start position:0%
helps
 
01:31:36.169 --> 01:31:36.179 align:start position:0%
um that we get to be part of the
 
01:31:38.570 --> 01:31:38.580 align:start position:0%
discussion I think the big thing that
 
01:31:41.209 --> 01:31:41.219 align:start position:0%
when I talk about things that are past
 
01:31:44.270 --> 01:31:44.280 align:start position:0%
that impact us it's when things are
 
01:31:45.770 --> 01:31:45.780 align:start position:0%
passed and they're not
 
01:31:48.050 --> 01:31:48.060 align:start position:0%
consider the financial implications of
 
01:31:50.510 --> 01:31:50.520 align:start position:0%
it because sometimes things are passed
 
01:31:52.729 --> 01:31:52.739 align:start position:0%
and then there's a financial uh burden
 
01:31:54.950 --> 01:31:54.960 align:start position:0%
that's put on either higher ed or
 
01:31:57.410 --> 01:31:57.420 align:start position:0%
students or something or for example
 
01:31:59.330 --> 01:31:59.340 align:start position:0%
this like is there going to be any
 
01:32:01.370 --> 01:32:01.380 align:start position:0%
financial burden put on schools to be
 
01:32:03.649 --> 01:32:03.659 align:start position:0%
able to implement this I think knowing
 
01:32:05.330 --> 01:32:05.340 align:start position:0%
the way that our budgets and the
 
01:32:07.790 --> 01:32:07.800 align:start position:0%
finances are structured in the state
 
01:32:10.310 --> 01:32:10.320 align:start position:0%
taking that into consideration is
 
01:32:12.169 --> 01:32:12.179 align:start position:0%
extremely helpful because sometimes it's
 
01:32:15.290 --> 01:32:15.300 align:start position:0%
a financial burden that is the biggest
 
01:32:18.050 --> 01:32:18.060 align:start position:0%
um a barrier for us is that a good way
 
01:32:19.790 --> 01:32:19.800 align:start position:0%
of saying it I mean for this the
 
01:32:22.010 --> 01:32:22.020 align:start position:0%
teaching of this implementing it higher
 
01:32:23.750 --> 01:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
ed we're already doing a lot of this
 
01:32:27.110 --> 01:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
within our programs I think when I think
 
01:32:28.189 --> 01:32:28.199 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:32:30.229 --> 01:32:30.239 align:start position:0%
um implications I think more on the
 
01:32:33.490 --> 01:32:33.500 align:start position:0%
schools and um is there going to be
 
01:32:35.750 --> 01:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
assessments that are required is there
 
01:32:37.910 --> 01:32:37.920 align:start position:0%
going to be certain curriculum what are
 
01:32:39.050 --> 01:32:39.060 align:start position:0%
things that are going to be put in
 
01:32:42.050 --> 01:32:42.060 align:start position:0%
schools that may create a barrier for
 
01:32:43.430 --> 01:32:43.440 align:start position:0%
this so those are things that go through
 
01:32:45.649 --> 01:32:45.659 align:start position:0%
my mind and one other thought because I
 
01:32:47.209 --> 01:32:47.219 align:start position:0%
actually you said something that got me
 
01:32:49.189 --> 01:32:49.199 align:start position:0%
thinking and I asked Brian you have
 
01:32:51.649 --> 01:32:51.659 align:start position:0%
middle school is great 678 but the
 
01:32:54.110 --> 01:32:54.120 align:start position:0%
licensure for social studies is five to
 
01:32:58.010 --> 01:32:58.020 align:start position:0%
twelve so in some schools our K-8 some
 
01:33:00.110 --> 01:33:00.120 align:start position:0%
are K to four and then five to eight
 
01:33:02.470 --> 01:33:02.480 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of variability so I don't
 
01:33:04.850 --> 01:33:04.860 align:start position:0%
it would be interesting to ask schools
 
01:33:07.010 --> 01:33:07.020 align:start position:0%
what they consider Middle grades well
 
01:33:09.169 --> 01:33:09.179 align:start position:0%
they're by Statute uh Middle grades or
 
01:33:10.850 --> 01:33:10.860 align:start position:0%
anything from grade four
 
01:33:13.729 --> 01:33:13.739 align:start position:0%
yeah through a possibly even nine to
 
01:33:15.770 --> 01:33:15.780 align:start position:0%
nine so that's some reason and so yes
 
01:33:17.750 --> 01:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of and and it's different
 
01:33:19.550 --> 01:33:19.560 align:start position:0%
all over the state it's just basically
 
01:33:22.129 --> 01:33:22.139 align:start position:0%
based on population a lot of uh
 
01:33:26.149 --> 01:33:26.159 align:start position:0%
Geographic issues yep but I just things
 
01:33:27.590 --> 01:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
to mentioned does that answer your
 
01:33:27.600 --> 01:33:31.390 align:start position:0%
to mentioned does that answer your
question

01:33:31.390 --> 01:33:31.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:35.450 --> 01:33:35.460 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman yes uh if I can address a
 
01:33:38.570 --> 01:33:38.580 align:start position:0%
couple of the points
 
01:33:38.580 --> 01:33:39.290 align:start position:0%
couple of the points
um

01:33:39.290 --> 01:33:39.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:39.300 --> 01:33:40.689 align:start position:0%
um
one

01:33:40.689 --> 01:33:40.699 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:33:43.790 --> 01:33:43.800 align:start position:0%
relative to uh professional development
 
01:33:45.229 --> 01:33:45.239 align:start position:0%
it's one of the things that New
 
01:33:47.750 --> 01:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Civics is fully prepared to do
 
01:33:51.290 --> 01:33:51.300 align:start position:0%
is use its professional development
 
01:33:53.350 --> 01:33:53.360 align:start position:0%
summer sessions
 
01:33:56.810 --> 01:33:56.820 align:start position:0%
to help the teachers you'll also notice
 
01:33:58.790 --> 01:33:58.800 align:start position:0%
the implementation date here is a year
 
01:34:01.970 --> 01:34:01.980 align:start position:0%
out so it gives time for that PD
 
01:34:04.450 --> 01:34:04.460 align:start position:0%
professional development to take place
 
01:34:08.629 --> 01:34:08.639 align:start position:0%
the the second uh thought is that this
 
01:34:12.050 --> 01:34:12.060 align:start position:0%
was written by social studies teachers
 
01:34:14.629 --> 01:34:14.639 align:start position:0%
so the the point about the middle school
 
01:34:17.110 --> 01:34:17.120 align:start position:0%
and sixth seventh and eighth grade
 
01:34:20.410 --> 01:34:20.420 align:start position:0%
is that that's when they
 
01:34:25.310 --> 01:34:25.320 align:start position:0%
introduce Civics instruction uh into a
 
01:34:29.330 --> 01:34:29.340 align:start position:0%
history like class so it's it's their
 
01:34:33.050 --> 01:34:33.060 align:start position:0%
input to uh as that that's the age
 
01:34:37.729 --> 01:34:37.739 align:start position:0%
appropriate uh grades to to have that
 
01:34:41.750 --> 01:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
over those three years uh the equivalent
 
01:34:44.890 --> 01:34:44.900 align:start position:0%
of a half credit course or
 
01:34:47.510 --> 01:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
a semester long
 
01:34:50.390 --> 01:34:50.400 align:start position:0%
yeah instruction that could be spread
 
01:34:52.010 --> 01:34:52.020 align:start position:0%
out in several different courses over
 
01:34:54.950 --> 01:34:54.960 align:start position:0%
over three years the the last thing is
 
01:34:59.090 --> 01:34:59.100 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman on page two and uh I I
 
01:35:02.149 --> 01:35:02.159 align:start position:0%
appreciate your historic context for uh
 
01:35:05.750 --> 01:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
line 16 and and I recall from both the
 
01:35:08.870 --> 01:35:08.880 align:start position:0%
Senate and the house hearings that the
 
01:35:13.010 --> 01:35:13.020 align:start position:0%
desire to want to start to add to the
 
01:35:18.050 --> 01:35:18.060 align:start position:0%
such as uh is that it's it's a limitless
 
01:35:23.810 --> 01:35:23.820 align:start position:0%
uh uh Clause that uh you know so where
 
01:35:27.649 --> 01:35:27.659 align:start position:0%
do we stop with such as is but uh I I
 
01:35:30.770 --> 01:35:30.780 align:start position:0%
understand why you would want to call
 
01:35:34.610 --> 01:35:34.620 align:start position:0%
reference to that historic note in New
 
01:35:38.750 --> 01:35:38.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's history and uh but again it
 
01:35:41.810 --> 01:35:41.820 align:start position:0%
it's uh it's something that has come up
 
01:35:44.570 --> 01:35:44.580 align:start position:0%
in both hearings as to well let's add
 
01:35:46.729 --> 01:35:46.739 align:start position:0%
this and why are we limiting civil
 
01:35:50.510 --> 01:35:50.520 align:start position:0%
rights debate to the 50s and 60s and uh
 
01:35:52.550 --> 01:35:52.560 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah I mean you you heard the
 
01:35:56.390 --> 01:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
comments uh in your hearing and uh
 
01:35:58.729 --> 01:35:58.739 align:start position:0%
that's that's the weakness of of trying
 
01:36:00.850 --> 01:36:00.860 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
01:36:04.910 --> 01:36:04.920 align:start position:0%
elucidate what the topics uh what the
 
01:36:08.750 --> 01:36:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:11.030 --> 01:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
yeah I I understand totally we don't
 
01:36:12.950 --> 01:36:12.960 align:start position:0%
want to make a laundry list and I agree
 
01:36:14.750 --> 01:36:14.760 align:start position:0%
I was only trying to make sure we got
 
01:36:17.030 --> 01:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire in there somewhere
 
01:36:17.040 --> 01:36:17.750 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire in there somewhere
um

01:36:17.750 --> 01:36:17.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:19.910 --> 01:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
but the interesting part that I noticed
 
01:36:22.189 --> 01:36:22.199 align:start position:0%
is on the bill that you know the
 
01:36:24.830 --> 01:36:24.840 align:start position:0%
sections which are maybe cost some time
 
01:36:27.550 --> 01:36:27.560 align:start position:0%
for professional development don't go
 
01:36:32.689 --> 01:36:32.699 align:start position:0%
don't occur until July 2024.
 
01:36:35.270 --> 01:36:35.280 align:start position:0%
which is it which is good that's right
 
01:36:37.129 --> 01:36:37.139 align:start position:0%
on the last page there in line six
 
01:36:38.450 --> 01:36:38.460 align:start position:0%
through eight
 
01:36:41.570 --> 01:36:41.580 align:start position:0%
which is also good but it'd also be good
 
01:36:43.370 --> 01:36:43.380 align:start position:0%
at the higher education could help us
 
01:36:46.370 --> 01:36:46.380 align:start position:0%
here you know we've and and Shannon
 
01:36:47.930 --> 01:36:47.940 align:start position:0%
alluded to the math learning communities
 
01:36:50.209 --> 01:36:50.219 align:start position:0%
program which we have 38 high schools
 
01:36:52.310 --> 01:36:52.320 align:start position:0%
which are involved with that and we
 
01:36:54.649 --> 01:36:54.659 align:start position:0%
uh put two hundred thousand dollars into
 
01:36:57.890 --> 01:36:57.900 align:start position:0%
the budget in support of of the support
 
01:37:00.770 --> 01:37:00.780 align:start position:0%
which we get from the community college
 
01:37:03.649 --> 01:37:03.659 align:start position:0%
system uh in providing professional
 
01:37:05.450 --> 01:37:05.460 align:start position:0%
training for our teachers in the Summer
 
01:37:09.229 --> 01:37:09.239 align:start position:0%
where they come down to nhti and
 
01:37:10.490 --> 01:37:10.500 align:start position:0%
wherever they you're going to end up
 
01:37:13.250 --> 01:37:13.260 align:start position:0%
doing that Shannon with death and and
 
01:37:15.890 --> 01:37:15.900 align:start position:0%
the teachers teach teachers uh those
 
01:37:17.330 --> 01:37:17.340 align:start position:0%
that are already involved with it they
 
01:37:19.370 --> 01:37:19.380 align:start position:0%
teach and here's how we can help those
 
01:37:21.350 --> 01:37:21.360 align:start position:0%
kids when they're in grades 11 and 12
 
01:37:23.510 --> 01:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
after we gave them the Next Generation
 
01:37:26.629 --> 01:37:26.639 align:start position:0%
math accuplacer test at the end of 10th
 
01:37:28.189 --> 01:37:28.199 align:start position:0%
grade to determine how they're
 
01:37:30.050 --> 01:37:30.060 align:start position:0%
functioning are they ready for algebra
 
01:37:32.090 --> 01:37:32.100 align:start position:0%
two or not then we take them off and put
 
01:37:34.370 --> 01:37:34.380 align:start position:0%
them into a math foundations then
 
01:37:36.950 --> 01:37:36.960 align:start position:0%
quantitative math which prepares them
 
01:37:39.169 --> 01:37:39.179 align:start position:0%
for going to it would be nice to have
 
01:37:42.110 --> 01:37:42.120 align:start position:0%
something similar in the area of civics
 
01:37:44.450 --> 01:37:44.460 align:start position:0%
I think it would be and I would speak I
 
01:37:46.850 --> 01:37:46.860 align:start position:0%
know that we do a Southwest Center so we
 
01:37:48.950 --> 01:37:48.960 align:start position:0%
do the monadnaught group it's like the
 
01:37:51.830 --> 01:37:51.840 align:start position:0%
whole southwest corner and we do summer
 
01:37:54.830 --> 01:37:54.840 align:start position:0%
Institute summer institutes with courses
 
01:37:56.689 --> 01:37:56.699 align:start position:0%
and then we also do professional
 
01:37:58.910 --> 01:37:58.920 align:start position:0%
development I would also assume Plymouth
 
01:38:00.890 --> 01:38:00.900 align:start position:0%
does it too for their region I think if
 
01:38:02.810 --> 01:38:02.820 align:start position:0%
money was put into support I mean
 
01:38:06.110 --> 01:38:06.120 align:start position:0%
between UNH and employment than us I
 
01:38:07.790 --> 01:38:07.800 align:start position:0%
think we could cover some of those
 
01:38:10.129 --> 01:38:10.139 align:start position:0%
pieces in those areas and bring some
 
01:38:13.010 --> 01:38:13.020 align:start position:0%
experts in that could do some of that
 
01:38:15.890 --> 01:38:15.900 align:start position:0%
Civic engagement did you put it
 
01:38:19.189 --> 01:38:19.199 align:start position:0%
we we put uh it was uh for the math
 
01:38:20.689 --> 01:38:20.699 align:start position:0%
learning communities we did it with Beth
 
01:38:23.689 --> 01:38:23.699 align:start position:0%
Dorian and Shannon we put 200 000 in
 
01:38:26.570 --> 01:38:26.580 align:start position:0%
there that's was the initial grant that
 
01:38:28.669 --> 01:38:28.679 align:start position:0%
Beth had received from the feds was for
 
01:38:31.850 --> 01:38:31.860 align:start position:0%
200 Grand and we got 38 high schools
 
01:38:34.010 --> 01:38:34.020 align:start position:0%
participating in it we ran out of grant
 
01:38:36.410 --> 01:38:36.420 align:start position:0%
money and everything's still in statute
 
01:38:38.209 --> 01:38:38.219 align:start position:0%
but there's no funding we put that money
 
01:38:40.370 --> 01:38:40.380 align:start position:0%
why don't you add something in and when
 
01:38:45.910 --> 01:38:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:51.050 --> 01:38:51.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:52.790 --> 01:38:52.800 align:start position:0%
and then we can work with the two you
 
01:38:55.910 --> 01:38:55.920 align:start position:0%
know what whomever wants to help do that
 
01:38:55.920 --> 01:38:58.250 align:start position:0%
know what whomever wants to help do that
it's

01:38:58.250 --> 01:38:58.260 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:39:01.250 --> 01:39:01.260 align:start position:0%
is there anything else I think we've
 
01:39:03.709 --> 01:39:03.719 align:start position:0%
pretty much I'm looking at this doc here
 
01:39:06.590 --> 01:39:06.600 align:start position:0%
the agenda what we had here
 
01:39:06.600 --> 01:39:07.189 align:start position:0%
the agenda what we had here
um

01:39:07.189 --> 01:39:07.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:09.830 --> 01:39:09.840 align:start position:0%
do the the Praxis test the last thing
 
01:39:12.410 --> 01:39:12.420 align:start position:0%
which we had on this agenda
 
01:39:12.420 --> 01:39:13.310 align:start position:0%
which we had on this agenda
um

01:39:13.310 --> 01:39:13.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:15.590 --> 01:39:15.600 align:start position:0%
if you're going to get certification in
 
01:39:17.090 --> 01:39:17.100 align:start position:0%
lower L
 
01:39:19.629 --> 01:39:19.639 align:start position:0%
um what Praxis tests do you have to take
 
01:39:23.750 --> 01:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
lower elementary K through five six so
 
01:39:26.629 --> 01:39:26.639 align:start position:0%
the k-6 licensure they have um Praxis to
 
01:39:28.790 --> 01:39:28.800 align:start position:0%
multi-subject tests so they have to and
 
01:39:31.310 --> 01:39:31.320 align:start position:0%
the foundations of reading tests so the
 
01:39:33.410 --> 01:39:33.420 align:start position:0%
multi-subject is language arts math
 
01:39:35.870 --> 01:39:35.880 align:start position:0%
social studies and Science and the
 
01:39:37.610 --> 01:39:37.620 align:start position:0%
foundations of reading is the literacy
 
01:39:37.620 --> 01:39:39.290 align:start position:0%
foundations of reading is the literacy
test

01:39:39.290 --> 01:39:39.300 align:start position:0%
test
 
01:39:42.770 --> 01:39:42.780 align:start position:0%
and the Press oh practice core that's to
 
01:39:44.570 --> 01:39:44.580 align:start position:0%
get into teacher Ed is a Praxis core
 
01:39:47.390 --> 01:39:47.400 align:start position:0%
that's for all are you comfortable using
 
01:39:51.290 --> 01:39:51.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:52.970 --> 01:39:52.980 align:start position:0%
I mean there's pros and cons to
 
01:39:56.090 --> 01:39:56.100 align:start position:0%
everything ironically
 
01:39:59.090 --> 01:39:59.100 align:start position:0%
to today's conversation the area for the
 
01:40:01.010 --> 01:40:01.020 align:start position:0%
practice too that students struggle with
 
01:40:04.189 --> 01:40:04.199 align:start position:0%
passing is the social studies
 
01:40:07.490 --> 01:40:07.500 align:start position:0%
um but it's not because of their
 
01:40:09.169 --> 01:40:09.179 align:start position:0%
knowledge and understanding the practice
 
01:40:12.169 --> 01:40:12.179 align:start position:0%
to for social studies for Led is the
 
01:40:15.169 --> 01:40:15.179 align:start position:0%
same content the breadth and you know
 
01:40:17.030 --> 01:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
the depth that is expected for the
 
01:40:19.189 --> 01:40:19.199 align:start position:0%
Praxis too for the the social studies
 
01:40:22.490 --> 01:40:22.500 align:start position:0%
for our K-12 but they keep switching it
 
01:40:25.070 --> 01:40:25.080 align:start position:0%
but it's not as big of a test so our
 
01:40:26.450 --> 01:40:26.460 align:start position:0%
students were studying you know being on
 
01:40:28.250 --> 01:40:28.260 align:start position:0%
one area and then they study that to
 
01:40:30.110 --> 01:40:30.120 align:start position:0%
retake it and it'll be a completely
 
01:40:33.950 --> 01:40:33.960 align:start position:0%
different test so I think the um the the
 
01:40:37.310 --> 01:40:37.320 align:start position:0%
test is is a difficult one that they
 
01:40:38.990 --> 01:40:39.000 align:start position:0%
struggle with but it's not because they
 
01:40:40.550 --> 01:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
don't know the social studies is trying
 
01:40:43.070 --> 01:40:43.080 align:start position:0%
to prepare for such a broad test that
 
01:40:46.970 --> 01:40:46.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:46.980 --> 01:40:47.990 align:start position:0%
 
hmm

01:40:47.990 --> 01:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
hmm
 
01:40:49.430 --> 01:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
maybe they didn't have any social
 
01:40:51.110 --> 01:40:51.120 align:start position:0%
studies when they're in high high school
 
01:40:54.290 --> 01:40:54.300 align:start position:0%
or or Elementary School like I'm hearing
 
01:40:55.729 --> 01:40:55.739 align:start position:0%
while they get to fourth grade New
 
01:40:56.870 --> 01:40:56.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire history
 
01:41:01.629 --> 01:41:01.639 align:start position:0%
one day a year when they visit this Dome
 
01:41:03.770 --> 01:41:03.780 align:start position:0%
for somebody because you know I sit
 
01:41:05.270 --> 01:41:05.280 align:start position:0%
there looking at the tests and how do we
 
01:41:06.830 --> 01:41:06.840 align:start position:0%
prepare and that's why we encourage them
 
01:41:08.270 --> 01:41:08.280 align:start position:0%
to take the history course we found a
 
01:41:09.530 --> 01:41:09.540 align:start position:0%
history course they'd help prepare them
 
01:41:13.490 --> 01:41:13.500 align:start position:0%
but it is such a broad spectrum and it's
 
01:41:15.649 --> 01:41:15.659 align:start position:0%
not they practice you know it just
 
01:41:18.110 --> 01:41:18.120 align:start position:0%
didn't go oh this is for elementary what
 
01:41:19.729 --> 01:41:19.739 align:start position:0%
do they need to know for social studies
 
01:41:21.709 --> 01:41:21.719 align:start position:0%
nobody has stopped and said that it's so
 
01:41:24.169 --> 01:41:24.179 align:start position:0%
broad I think if it was more focused
 
01:41:27.169 --> 01:41:27.179 align:start position:0%
into that what they need to know for K
 
01:41:29.689 --> 01:41:29.699 align:start position:0%
to six you know licensure I think the
 
01:41:31.430 --> 01:41:31.440 align:start position:0%
test would be
 
01:41:33.050 --> 01:41:33.060 align:start position:0%
um I I don't think it would be as much
 
01:41:36.350 --> 01:41:36.360 align:start position:0%
of a struggle for students to pass
 
01:41:38.810 --> 01:41:38.820 align:start position:0%
is there anything else that we need to
 
01:41:41.870 --> 01:41:41.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:44.149 --> 01:41:44.159 align:start position:0%
before before this group heads out I'd
 
01:41:46.129 --> 01:41:46.139 align:start position:0%
like to know what are we looking forward
 
01:41:49.189 --> 01:41:49.199 align:start position:0%
to review next I I know we have to
 
01:41:52.129 --> 01:41:52.139 align:start position:0%
follow the that the bill which we passed
 
01:41:56.209 --> 01:41:56.219 align:start position:0%
the what was it the 1530 the
 
01:41:58.550 --> 01:41:58.560 align:start position:0%
the associate's degree leading towards
 
01:42:00.530 --> 01:42:00.540 align:start position:0%
the junior year
 
01:42:03.050 --> 01:42:03.060 align:start position:0%
finding out how that's working out or
 
01:42:05.450 --> 01:42:05.460 align:start position:0%
all if has there been any positive
 
01:42:07.310 --> 01:42:07.320 align:start position:0%
feedback negative feedback
 
01:42:09.649 --> 01:42:09.659 align:start position:0%
I I'd like to know how that's working
 
01:42:11.930 --> 01:42:11.940 align:start position:0%
what was the
 
01:42:14.689 --> 01:42:14.699 align:start position:0%
was there a report from this committee
 
01:42:16.790 --> 01:42:16.800 align:start position:0%
two years ago
 
01:42:19.310 --> 01:42:19.320 align:start position:0%
it was a bill it was Representative no
 
01:42:21.169 --> 01:42:21.179 align:start position:0%
no I know that but it but was there a
 
01:42:25.070 --> 01:42:25.080 align:start position:0%
report from this committee and
 
01:42:30.470 --> 01:42:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:30.480 --> 01:42:31.189 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:42:31.189 --> 01:42:31.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:32.570 --> 01:42:32.580 align:start position:0%
it was
 
01:42:35.689 --> 01:42:35.699 align:start position:0%
the Senate conducted that I'd have to
 
01:42:37.370 --> 01:42:37.380 align:start position:0%
have to look I'm going back the last
 
01:42:40.370 --> 01:42:40.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:40.380 --> 01:42:43.370 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:42:43.370 --> 01:42:43.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:46.669 --> 01:42:46.679 align:start position:0%
August 18 2021
 
01:42:48.530 --> 01:42:48.540 align:start position:0%
okay that would be two years ago yeah
 
01:42:48.540 --> 01:42:51.550 align:start position:0%
okay that would be two years ago yeah
yeah

01:42:51.550 --> 01:42:51.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:54.290 --> 01:42:54.300 align:start position:0%
so Senator Ward was chairing at that
 
01:42:56.330 --> 01:42:56.340 align:start position:0%
time and that report's right here so we
 
01:42:57.830 --> 01:42:57.840 align:start position:0%
should probably look at that report see
 
01:42:59.570 --> 01:42:59.580 align:start position:0%
if there's any hope you know as homework
 
01:43:01.430 --> 01:43:01.440 align:start position:0%
see if there's any action items like
 
01:43:03.709 --> 01:43:03.719 align:start position:0%
well the big issue back then was dealing
 
01:43:05.390 --> 01:43:05.400 align:start position:0%
with the community the merger remember
 
01:43:07.910 --> 01:43:07.920 align:start position:0%
the merger and we had the subcommittee
 
01:43:09.109 --> 01:43:09.119 align:start position:0%
here where they're going to merge the
 
01:43:10.450 --> 01:43:10.460 align:start position:0%
two systems
 
01:43:12.830 --> 01:43:12.840 align:start position:0%
and I'd be curious to know where we're
 
01:43:14.689 --> 01:43:14.699 align:start position:0%
on that too Kathy Province should be the
 
01:43:16.189 --> 01:43:16.199 align:start position:0%
one to contact
 
01:43:17.510 --> 01:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
or Mark
 
01:43:19.189 --> 01:43:19.199 align:start position:0%
nothing huh
 
01:43:20.990 --> 01:43:21.000 align:start position:0%
I don't think we've gone anywhere on
 
01:43:24.169 --> 01:43:24.179 align:start position:0%
that right right well I think I think
 
01:43:25.970 --> 01:43:25.980 align:start position:0%
the question you raised Rick about the
 
01:43:25.980 --> 01:43:27.410 align:start position:0%
the question you raised Rick about the
matriculation

01:43:27.410 --> 01:43:27.420 align:start position:0%
matriculation
 
01:43:30.229 --> 01:43:30.239 align:start position:0%
from associate degree to
 
01:43:32.930 --> 01:43:32.940 align:start position:0%
the institution I'd be interested to see
 
01:43:36.350 --> 01:43:36.360 align:start position:0%
where that is how many students take uh
 
01:43:39.229 --> 01:43:39.239 align:start position:0%
advantage of that and what's been the
 
01:43:40.729 --> 01:43:40.739 align:start position:0%
success of that program because I know
 
01:43:42.050 --> 01:43:42.060 align:start position:0%
as I've talked with people around the
 
01:43:45.129 --> 01:43:45.139 align:start position:0%
country when I mentioned that agreement
 
01:43:48.229 --> 01:43:48.239 align:start position:0%
it's very popular from a standpoint of
 
01:43:50.390 --> 01:43:50.400 align:start position:0%
we basically let part of the way in
 
01:43:53.570 --> 01:43:53.580 align:start position:0%
doing that so let me ask as Tanya this
 
01:43:55.129 --> 01:43:55.139 align:start position:0%
question so our kids coming down from
 
01:43:56.689 --> 01:43:56.699 align:start position:0%
White Mountain Community College has a
 
01:43:56.699 --> 01:43:57.530 align:start position:0%
White Mountain Community College has a
two-year

01:43:57.530 --> 01:43:57.540 align:start position:0%
two-year
 
01:44:00.649 --> 01:44:00.659 align:start position:0%
ticket and they want to become you know
 
01:44:03.470 --> 01:44:03.480 align:start position:0%
get a four-year degree from
 
01:44:06.350 --> 01:44:06.360 align:start position:0%
King state are you going to accept those
 
01:44:08.030 --> 01:44:08.040 align:start position:0%
credits or what's the process you're
 
01:44:10.370 --> 01:44:10.380 align:start position:0%
going to take we don't accept all the
 
01:44:12.229 --> 01:44:12.239 align:start position:0%
credits they they have agreements I do
 
01:44:12.239 --> 01:44:13.129 align:start position:0%
credits they they have agreements I do
know

01:44:13.129 --> 01:44:13.139 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:44:14.990 --> 01:44:15.000 align:start position:0%
um that a lot of our programs create
 
01:44:16.189 --> 01:44:16.199 align:start position:0%
agreements with all the different
 
01:44:17.810 --> 01:44:17.820 align:start position:0%
community colleges and they say take
 
01:44:19.729 --> 01:44:19.739 align:start position:0%
this or take that
 
01:44:22.490 --> 01:44:22.500 align:start position:0%
um I will say for Ed prep the difficult
 
01:44:25.250 --> 01:44:25.260 align:start position:0%
thing is because of all the data and the
 
01:44:27.410 --> 01:44:27.420 align:start position:0%
licensure requirements and our
 
01:44:29.390 --> 01:44:29.400 align:start position:0%
accreditation requirements we will only
 
01:44:31.910 --> 01:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
accept credits in our one in 200 level
 
01:44:34.490 --> 01:44:34.500 align:start position:0%
courses we do not accept
 
01:44:36.470 --> 01:44:36.480 align:start position:0%
um transfer credits in our methods
 
01:44:39.590 --> 01:44:39.600 align:start position:0%
practicum and Beyond so if they had
 
01:44:44.209 --> 01:44:44.219 align:start position:0%
taken an ed prep program at nhti we take
 
01:44:45.530 --> 01:44:45.540 align:start position:0%
some of those and usually we do an
 
01:44:47.090 --> 01:44:47.100 align:start position:0%
individual review but we do actually
 
01:44:51.890 --> 01:44:51.900 align:start position:0%
have a um a a an agreement with them uh
 
01:44:53.950 --> 01:44:53.960 align:start position:0%
if you take this it's equivalent to this
 
01:44:56.450 --> 01:44:56.460 align:start position:0%
uh but it's interesting because they
 
01:44:58.129 --> 01:44:58.139 align:start position:0%
take a bunch of courses and some of them
 
01:45:00.830 --> 01:45:00.840 align:start position:0%
it doesn't always I mean it'd be nice at
 
01:45:02.030 --> 01:45:02.040 align:start position:0%
some point to be like well they do this
 
01:45:03.950 --> 01:45:03.960 align:start position:0%
and we do this like is there something
 
01:45:06.350 --> 01:45:06.360 align:start position:0%
that meets in the middle I am now
 
01:45:09.890 --> 01:45:09.900 align:start position:0%
working with uh uh CT Career and
 
01:45:11.689 --> 01:45:11.699 align:start position:0%
Technical Ed that's starting a behavior
 
01:45:14.209 --> 01:45:14.219 align:start position:0%
science program up in Claremont and they
 
01:45:16.010 --> 01:45:16.020 align:start position:0%
actually asked us to come in earlier
 
01:45:18.109 --> 01:45:18.119 align:start position:0%
because they're starting to form it and
 
01:45:19.669 --> 01:45:19.679 align:start position:0%
so I have a colleague that's going to be
 
01:45:21.109 --> 01:45:21.119 align:start position:0%
working with them so that they can look
 
01:45:23.030 --> 01:45:23.040 align:start position:0%
at the courses when they create it how
 
01:45:25.910 --> 01:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
it directly aligns to um to what you
 
01:45:28.310 --> 01:45:28.320 align:start position:0%
know intro courses so that it makes it a
 
01:45:30.050 --> 01:45:30.060 align:start position:0%
smoother transition for students when
 
01:45:32.270 --> 01:45:32.280 align:start position:0%
they come in so some of those things are
 
01:45:33.890 --> 01:45:33.900 align:start position:0%
happening as well but that's not for the
 
01:45:37.129 --> 01:45:37.139 align:start position:0%
con Community College
 
01:45:38.390 --> 01:45:38.400 align:start position:0%
you asked White Mountains Community
 
01:45:39.770 --> 01:45:39.780 align:start position:0%
College Plymouth has been working a lot
 
01:45:41.030 --> 01:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
with White Mountains Community College
 
01:45:43.070 --> 01:45:43.080 align:start position:0%
to really smooth that pathway especially
 
01:45:45.109 --> 01:45:45.119 align:start position:0%
in and as someone I worked at the
 
01:45:46.490 --> 01:45:46.500 align:start position:0%
community college
 
01:45:49.010 --> 01:45:49.020 align:start position:0%
um in a dual role prior to so I think
 
01:45:50.270 --> 01:45:50.280 align:start position:0%
it's really important we've been doing
 
01:45:52.609 --> 01:45:52.619 align:start position:0%
that um Outreach also with the Lakes
 
01:45:54.229 --> 01:45:54.239 align:start position:0%
regions as well Community College and
 
01:45:55.609 --> 01:45:55.619 align:start position:0%
really trying to smooth that pathway as
 
01:45:57.290 --> 01:45:57.300 align:start position:0%
much as possible so yes that's been a
 
01:45:59.629 --> 01:45:59.639 align:start position:0%
big part of our admissions program and
 
01:46:01.729 --> 01:46:01.739 align:start position:0%
it will continue to be so to try to
 
01:46:04.250 --> 01:46:04.260 align:start position:0%
remove barriers so that I agree students
 
01:46:05.450 --> 01:46:05.460 align:start position:0%
pay for the credits at the community
 
01:46:07.430 --> 01:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
college and then we want you know they
 
01:46:09.169 --> 01:46:09.179 align:start position:0%
can transfer in
 
01:46:11.270 --> 01:46:11.280 align:start position:0%
um and then towards getting a four-year
 
01:46:13.609 --> 01:46:13.619 align:start position:0%
degree and I would say I think a lot of
 
01:46:15.350 --> 01:46:15.360 align:start position:0%
the courtesy transfer intend to be to
 
01:46:18.590 --> 01:46:18.600 align:start position:0%
our general education program the ISP
 
01:46:20.570 --> 01:46:20.580 align:start position:0%
um and I think that
 
01:46:22.669 --> 01:46:22.679 align:start position:0%
a lot of our liberal arts majors are
 
01:46:24.649 --> 01:46:24.659 align:start position:0%
much more flexible with the um credits
 
01:46:26.570 --> 01:46:26.580 align:start position:0%
coming in I see you know nodding her
 
01:46:29.450 --> 01:46:29.460 align:start position:0%
head over there so I don't think it's as
 
01:46:32.209 --> 01:46:32.219 align:start position:0%
like you do this you're in here it's
 
01:46:34.310 --> 01:46:34.320 align:start position:0%
more looking at the programs and um
 
01:46:36.890 --> 01:46:36.900 align:start position:0%
they're each kind of uh program specific
 
01:46:39.169 --> 01:46:39.179 align:start position:0%
if that makes sense
 
01:46:41.450 --> 01:46:41.460 align:start position:0%
I think that will be something we put on
 
01:46:43.609 --> 01:46:43.619 align:start position:0%
the docket follow-up to the bill which
 
01:46:47.510 --> 01:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
we passed which was hb1530
 
01:46:50.689 --> 01:46:50.699 align:start position:0%
and we'll we'll follow up on that one
 
01:46:55.729 --> 01:46:55.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:58.310 --> 01:46:58.320 align:start position:0%
well I think you're uh I think I like
 
01:47:00.890 --> 01:47:00.900 align:start position:0%
that the the article you give okay we
 
01:47:02.270 --> 01:47:02.280 align:start position:0%
should spend some time talking about
 
01:47:05.030 --> 01:47:05.040 align:start position:0%
that oh this right here
 
01:47:07.970 --> 01:47:07.980 align:start position:0%
did everybody get a copy of this it's
 
01:47:10.370 --> 01:47:10.380 align:start position:0%
out of the Wall Street Journal back on 2
 
01:47:13.850 --> 01:47:13.860 align:start position:0%
3 23 so February 3rd
 
01:47:17.030 --> 01:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
uh College doesn't need to take four
 
01:47:17.040 --> 01:47:18.530 align:start position:0%
uh College doesn't need to take four
years

01:47:18.530 --> 01:47:18.540 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:47:22.070 --> 01:47:22.080 align:start position:0%
uh it was written by a Mr Wyatt a senior
 
01:47:24.470 --> 01:47:24.480 align:start position:0%
executive director for Statewide online
 
01:47:27.050 --> 01:47:27.060 align:start position:0%
education in the Utah system of higher
 
01:47:27.060 --> 01:47:28.189 align:start position:0%
education in the Utah system of higher
education

01:47:28.189 --> 01:47:28.199 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:47:32.750 --> 01:47:32.760 align:start position:0%
and uh Mr will guilezo is director of
 
01:47:34.370 --> 01:47:34.380 align:start position:0%
the initiative on politics and
 
01:47:36.649 --> 01:47:36.659 align:start position:0%
sportsmanship in Princeton University's
 
01:47:38.810 --> 01:47:38.820 align:start position:0%
James Madison program
 
01:47:41.149 --> 01:47:41.159 align:start position:0%
it's kind of an interesting article that
 
01:47:42.370 --> 01:47:42.380 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:47:45.830 --> 01:47:45.840 align:start position:0%
you take a lot of this gen Ed stuff and
 
01:47:47.209 --> 01:47:47.219 align:start position:0%
the stuff that you're really going to
 
01:47:49.310 --> 01:47:49.320 align:start position:0%
need is the stuff you're taking for your
 
01:47:50.990 --> 01:47:51.000 align:start position:0%
your skill that you want to go out and
 
01:47:54.350 --> 01:47:54.360 align:start position:0%
work with in the career so there's I
 
01:47:56.870 --> 01:47:56.880 align:start position:0%
think they're arguing here well since I
 
01:47:58.550 --> 01:47:58.560 align:start position:0%
briefly read that I mean the whole
 
01:48:01.490 --> 01:48:01.500 align:start position:0%
question is is do we move to a higher
 
01:48:03.169 --> 01:48:03.179 align:start position:0%
education we just deal with a bunch of
 
01:48:05.450 --> 01:48:05.460 align:start position:0%
badges that you're going to earn and
 
01:48:07.609 --> 01:48:07.619 align:start position:0%
certificates you're going to earn and
 
01:48:10.430 --> 01:48:10.440 align:start position:0%
how do you deal with with the liberal
 
01:48:13.129 --> 01:48:13.139 align:start position:0%
arts as far as I'll give you an example
 
01:48:14.689 --> 01:48:14.699 align:start position:0%
I was reading this I said now wait a
 
01:48:17.510 --> 01:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
second I would know nothing about
 
01:48:20.330 --> 01:48:20.340 align:start position:0%
monksan Michelle and short and and the
 
01:48:24.470 --> 01:48:24.480 align:start position:0%
uh stained glasses in that Cathedral had
 
01:48:26.510 --> 01:48:26.520 align:start position:0%
I not taken an art course which I didn't
 
01:48:29.030 --> 01:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
want to take but so I mean there there
 
01:48:31.430 --> 01:48:31.440 align:start position:0%
is a question that I'd like to entertain
 
01:48:33.470 --> 01:48:33.480 align:start position:0%
with this committee about how do you
 
01:48:35.810 --> 01:48:35.820 align:start position:0%
deal with just that badges approach of
 
01:48:37.609 --> 01:48:37.619 align:start position:0%
just I'm going to get this certificate
 
01:48:40.250 --> 01:48:40.260 align:start position:0%
that certificate every Visa B looking at
 
01:48:42.290 --> 01:48:42.300 align:start position:0%
a more of a liberal arts approach of
 
01:48:43.910 --> 01:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
maybe taking some stuff I really don't
 
01:48:45.830 --> 01:48:45.840 align:start position:0%
want to take but when I take it I find
 
01:48:47.330 --> 01:48:47.340 align:start position:0%
out hey there's something there that I
 
01:48:49.669 --> 01:48:49.679 align:start position:0%
didn't want yeah and I think that's what
 
01:48:52.010 --> 01:48:52.020 align:start position:0%
this is talking about I think as I
 
01:48:53.570 --> 01:48:53.580 align:start position:0%
looked at this article that's what
 
01:48:56.330 --> 01:48:56.340 align:start position:0%
that's really talking about what is a
 
01:48:58.070 --> 01:48:58.080 align:start position:0%
general education that a student ought
 
01:48:59.990 --> 01:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
to have before they started the
 
01:49:01.970 --> 01:49:01.980 align:start position:0%
workforce or we just training them for
 
01:49:04.129 --> 01:49:04.139 align:start position:0%
the workforce and then by the way I may
 
01:49:05.930 --> 01:49:05.940 align:start position:0%
get into that Workforce and that's not
 
01:49:08.209 --> 01:49:08.219 align:start position:0%
what I want to do and don't forget if
 
01:49:09.410 --> 01:49:09.420 align:start position:0%
you're going to talk about Civics
 
01:49:11.450 --> 01:49:11.460 align:start position:0%
education it's in the liberal arts that
 
01:49:12.950 --> 01:49:12.960 align:start position:0%
you get the skills that help you
 
01:49:15.709 --> 01:49:15.719 align:start position:0%
critically think and be creative and to
 
01:49:17.270 --> 01:49:17.280 align:start position:0%
understand multiple cultures and
 
01:49:19.490 --> 01:49:19.500 align:start position:0%
perspectives and those things so there
 
01:49:21.950 --> 01:49:21.960 align:start position:0%
is a value and interesting enough and I
 
01:49:23.030 --> 01:49:23.040 align:start position:0%
don't know if you could say this that
 
01:49:24.410 --> 01:49:24.420 align:start position:0%
there are sometimes students that
 
01:49:26.330 --> 01:49:26.340 align:start position:0%
they're going through and are at prep
 
01:49:28.189 --> 01:49:28.199 align:start position:0%
program and someone like oh my head on
 
01:49:29.810 --> 01:49:29.820 align:start position:0%
credits I want to do methods in
 
01:49:31.550 --> 01:49:31.560 align:start position:0%
sophomore year and I'll look and I'll be
 
01:49:33.290 --> 01:49:33.300 align:start position:0%
like that student's not ready the
 
01:49:36.410 --> 01:49:36.420 align:start position:0%
maturity wise there's a development that
 
01:49:39.410 --> 01:49:39.420 align:start position:0%
occurs through the four years and both
 
01:49:41.330 --> 01:49:41.340 align:start position:0%
students and you know I was in chair at
 
01:49:42.770 --> 01:49:42.780 align:start position:0%
the time were like oh no just let them
 
01:49:44.750 --> 01:49:44.760 align:start position:0%
go on both of the students didn't finish
 
01:49:46.790 --> 01:49:46.800 align:start position:0%
the program they struggled
 
01:49:49.129 --> 01:49:49.139 align:start position:0%
um going into it so there is
 
01:49:52.609 --> 01:49:52.619 align:start position:0%
it's a balance of EX you know being
 
01:49:55.010 --> 01:49:55.020 align:start position:0%
exposed and kind of engaging in things
 
01:49:56.750 --> 01:49:56.760 align:start position:0%
that you may not have and learning stuff
 
01:49:59.629 --> 01:49:59.639 align:start position:0%
about yourself but also development that
 
01:50:01.189 --> 01:50:01.199 align:start position:0%
happens in college that needs to be
 
01:50:01.199 --> 01:50:02.570 align:start position:0%
happens in college that needs to be
appreciated

01:50:02.570 --> 01:50:02.580 align:start position:0%
appreciated
 
01:50:03.950 --> 01:50:03.960 align:start position:0%
I think this article is trying to
 
01:50:06.229 --> 01:50:06.239 align:start position:0%
capture the idea and it says it in bold
 
01:50:08.270 --> 01:50:08.280 align:start position:0%
here for many students the standard
 
01:50:10.729 --> 01:50:10.739 align:start position:0%
bachelor's degree program has become a
 
01:50:13.310 --> 01:50:13.320 align:start position:0%
costly straight jacket
 
01:50:16.250 --> 01:50:16.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:19.370 --> 01:50:19.380 align:start position:0%
maybe we want to talk about that but but
 
01:50:21.530 --> 01:50:21.540 align:start position:0%
there's a creating organizations well
