parks what we learned in the testimony
 
00:22:16.270 --> 00:22:16.280 align:start position:0%
is that in the state parks
 
00:22:19.250 --> 00:22:19.260 align:start position:0%
the division already allows dogs off
 
00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
leash and under the control of their
 
00:22:24.110 --> 00:22:24.120 align:start position:0%
Handler under their administrative rules
 
00:22:26.810 --> 00:22:26.820 align:start position:0%
and our ability their ability to tailor
 
00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:28.440 align:start position:0%
their administrative roles is really
 
00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:30.190 align:start position:0%

most recent Amendment comes after a lot

of discussion about um uh how best to

dra commissioner and also Town officials
 
00:26:53.330 --> 00:26:53.340 align:start position:0%
and so consensus seems to be pointing uh
 
00:26:56.390 --> 00:26:56.400 align:start position:0%
at adding the most recent Edition which
 
00:26:59.210 --> 00:26:59.220 align:start position:0%
would be on line 31.
 
00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:00.169 align:start position:0%
would be on line 31.
um

00:27:00.169 --> 00:27:00.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:02.450 --> 00:27:02.460 align:start position:0%
it just simply says
 
00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:03.110 align:start position:0%
it just simply says
um

00:27:03.110 --> 00:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:05.750 --> 00:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
if uh provided that the assessing
 
00:27:07.789 --> 00:27:07.799 align:start position:0%
officials have not communicated to the
 
00:27:09.289 --> 00:27:09.299 align:start position:0%
owner a reason why conditions for
 
00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
approval have not been met uh the owner
 
00:27:13.730 --> 00:27:13.740 align:start position:0%
May commence The Cutting operation and
 
00:27:16.549 --> 00:27:16.559 align:start position:0%
then I added after submitting a copy of
 
00:27:18.890 --> 00:27:18.900 align:start position:0%
the intent and providing the data filing
 
00:27:21.649 --> 00:27:21.659 align:start position:0%
to the commissioner of the revenue
 
00:27:21.659 --> 00:27:23.149 align:start position:0%
to the commissioner of the revenue
Administration

00:27:23.149 --> 00:27:23.159 align:start position:0%
Administration
 
00:27:25.250 --> 00:27:25.260 align:start position:0%
so it gives an extra layer of protection
 
00:27:28.789 --> 00:27:28.799 align:start position:0%
for the town officials and the timber
 
00:27:30.890 --> 00:27:30.900 align:start position:0%
Cutters and that's the reason for that
 
00:27:31.970 --> 00:27:31.980 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:27:33.710 --> 00:27:33.720 align:start position:0%

does allow for adequate notification it
 
00:27:53.510 --> 00:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
simplifies the process if the town fails
 
00:27:55.970 --> 00:27:55.980 align:start position:0%
to respond the timber Cutters agree to
 
00:27:58.090 --> 00:27:58.100 align:start position:0%
this amendment as well
 
00:28:00.049 --> 00:28:00.059 align:start position:0%
electronic notification and the calendar
 
00:28:02.810 --> 00:28:02.820 align:start position:0%
day provision uh simplifies the process
 
00:28:04.730 --> 00:28:04.740 align:start position:0%
entirely and streamlines and allows the
 
00:28:07.570 --> 00:28:07.580 align:start position:0%
timber cutters to cut when the weather
 
00:28:10.669 --> 00:28:10.679 align:start position:0%
is most
 
00:28:13.130 --> 00:28:13.140 align:start position:0%
most appropriate for their cutting

00:31:59.399 --> 00:32:01.430 align:start position:0%
we prefer to pass with a notification
requirement

second
 
00:32:11.090 --> 00:32:11.100 align:start position:0%
Mr will representative wolf
 
00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:12.649 align:start position:0%
Mr will representative wolf

00:32:12.649 --> 00:32:12.659 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:32:14.950 --> 00:32:14.960 align:start position:0%
any further discussion on the motion
 
00:32:18.649 --> 00:32:18.659 align:start position:0%
representative uh Darby
 
00:32:20.870 --> 00:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:32:23.389 --> 00:32:23.399 align:start position:0%
um so uh House Bill 205 and House Bill
 
00:32:25.789 --> 00:32:25.799 align:start position:0%
398 are substantially different from one
 
00:32:28.850 --> 00:32:28.860 align:start position:0%
another house bill 205 includes water
 
00:32:32.289 --> 00:32:32.299 align:start position:0%
testing Provisions House Bill 398
 
00:32:32.299 --> 00:32:33.850 align:start position:0%
testing Provisions House Bill 398
includes

00:32:33.850 --> 00:32:33.860 align:start position:0%
includes
 
00:32:38.090 --> 00:32:38.100 align:start position:0%
a disclosure Clause as well I think that
 
00:32:41.330 --> 00:32:41.340 align:start position:0%
we should act on 205 and not find in
 
00:32:42.889 --> 00:32:42.899 align:start position:0%
Expedia intellectually
 
00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
because the water testing provision is
 
00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
critical to the quality of water in New
 
00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:49.310 align:start position:0%
critical to the quality of water in New
Hampshire

00:32:49.310 --> 00:32:49.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:32:51.529 --> 00:32:51.539 align:start position:0%
thank you anyone else to speak on the
 
00:32:53.930 --> 00:32:53.940 align:start position:0%
motion representative Iran thank you Mr
 
00:32:53.940 --> 00:32:55.010 align:start position:0%
motion representative Iran thank you Mr
chairman

00:32:55.010 --> 00:32:55.020 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:32:57.649 --> 00:32:57.659 align:start position:0%
um I I agree with my colleague from
 
00:33:00.169 --> 00:33:00.179 align:start position:0%
Nashua and want to point out to my
 
00:33:02.149 --> 00:33:02.159 align:start position:0%
colleague from Merrimack that these are
 
00:33:04.490 --> 00:33:04.500 align:start position:0%
very two different bills
 
00:33:08.389 --> 00:33:08.399 align:start position:0%
um 398 only addresses notification
 
00:33:12.889 --> 00:33:12.899 align:start position:0%
that's it where 205 requires water
 
00:33:15.409 --> 00:33:15.419 align:start position:0%
testing for new wells and the reason
 
00:33:17.810 --> 00:33:17.820 align:start position:0%
that is so critically important is we
 
00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:20.880 align:start position:0%
have very inconsistent analysis
 
00:33:23.330 --> 00:33:23.340 align:start position:0%
throughout the state as we heard in the
 
00:33:25.789 --> 00:33:25.799 align:start position:0%
public hearing and I believe it was uh
 
00:33:28.070 --> 00:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
Mr Grace from New Hampshire water well
 
00:33:30.649 --> 00:33:30.659 align:start position:0%
associations that there's inconsistent
 
00:33:33.529 --> 00:33:33.539 align:start position:0%
water tests between municipalities he
 
00:33:35.470 --> 00:33:35.480 align:start position:0%
wants more standardization
 
00:33:38.930 --> 00:33:38.940 align:start position:0%
there was an antidote about a person who
 
00:33:43.009 --> 00:33:43.019 align:start position:0%
was happy they're well passed but it was
 
00:33:45.470 --> 00:33:45.480 align:start position:0%
only tested for bacteria where someone
 
00:33:47.509 --> 00:33:47.519 align:start position:0%
in another Community might find they
 
00:33:50.570 --> 00:33:50.580 align:start position:0%
have arsenic lead chlorine green might
 
00:33:53.330 --> 00:33:53.340 align:start position:0%
be measured so there's very inconsistent
 
00:33:55.789 --> 00:33:55.799 align:start position:0%
standards throughout the state and this
 
00:33:58.490 --> 00:33:58.500 align:start position:0%
gives very different expectations and
 
00:34:00.889 --> 00:34:00.899 align:start position:0%
assurances to Granite Staters and I
 
00:34:03.289 --> 00:34:03.299 align:start position:0%
believe they all deserve to have their
 
00:34:06.649 --> 00:34:06.659 align:start position:0%
water tested with the same analysis the
 
00:34:09.349 --> 00:34:09.359 align:start position:0%
same analytes so that they can be
 
00:34:14.030 --> 00:34:14.040 align:start position:0%
prepared to install if necessary the
 
00:34:16.790 --> 00:34:16.800 align:start position:0%
proper filtration or treatment systems
 
00:34:20.389 --> 00:34:20.399 align:start position:0%
it's going to be far more expensive I
 
00:34:23.990 --> 00:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
would expect and for them to discover
 
00:34:26.030 --> 00:34:26.040 align:start position:0%
after they've been living in the house
 
00:34:27.889 --> 00:34:27.899 align:start position:0%
that they have a contaminant that they
 
00:34:29.930 --> 00:34:29.940 align:start position:0%
could have easily installed a treatment
 
00:34:32.950 --> 00:34:32.960 align:start position:0%
system for during the construction
 
00:34:36.889 --> 00:34:36.899 align:start position:0%
and it all depends on what that water
 
00:34:40.669 --> 00:34:40.679 align:start position:0%
test is so I'm I'm very much opposed to
 
00:34:42.409 --> 00:34:42.419 align:start position:0%
killing this bill I think we need the
 
00:34:45.970 --> 00:34:45.980 align:start position:0%
standardization it was also supported by
 
00:34:49.010 --> 00:34:49.020 align:start position:0%
Mr Brandon Kieran from the Des is
 
00:34:50.770 --> 00:34:50.780 align:start position:0%
drinking Water Division
 
00:34:56.329 --> 00:34:56.339 align:start position:0%
so I I do would implore my colleagues on
 
00:34:59.210 --> 00:34:59.220 align:start position:0%
this committee to defeat the itl so that
 
00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:01.680 align:start position:0%
another motion can be made
 
00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you anyone else wishing
 
00:35:08.210 --> 00:35:08.220 align:start position:0%
to speak on the motion to itl
 
00:35:10.609 --> 00:35:10.619 align:start position:0%
representative representative would you
 
00:35:13.250 --> 00:35:13.260 align:start position:0%
consider retaining this bill so that we
 
00:35:15.230 --> 00:35:15.240 align:start position:0%
can work on it and defense I agree with
 
00:35:16.670 --> 00:35:16.680 align:start position:0%
actually much of what you said about the
 
00:35:19.069 --> 00:35:19.079 align:start position:0%
inconsistent standards and I do think we
 
00:35:21.170 --> 00:35:21.180 align:start position:0%
need to work on it actually and I'd
 
00:35:23.870 --> 00:35:23.880 align:start position:0%
almost prefer to retain it especially
 
00:35:25.970 --> 00:35:25.980 align:start position:0%
for our specific community
 
00:35:28.730 --> 00:35:28.740 align:start position:0%
and I wouldn't mind working on it and I
 
00:35:31.130 --> 00:35:31.140 align:start position:0%
wish that we could actually take up the
 
00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:32.640 align:start position:0%
other bill first
 
00:35:34.310 --> 00:35:34.320 align:start position:0%
for that purpose but they just came in
 
00:35:37.190 --> 00:35:37.200 align:start position:0%
this numerical order yeah would you want
 
00:35:38.450 --> 00:35:38.460 align:start position:0%
to consider
 
00:35:41.030 --> 00:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
retaining this bill
 
00:35:42.890 --> 00:35:42.900 align:start position:0%
and so we could
 
00:35:45.250 --> 00:35:45.260 align:start position:0%
fix it
 
00:35:47.630 --> 00:35:47.640 align:start position:0%
representative wrong okay thank you Mr
 
00:35:50.690 --> 00:35:50.700 align:start position:0%
chair actually Mr uh representative we
 
00:35:53.450 --> 00:35:53.460 align:start position:0%
did actually did work on an amendment if
 
00:35:55.609 --> 00:35:55.619 align:start position:0%
you remember the only concerns that were
 
00:35:57.109 --> 00:35:57.119 align:start position:0%
brought up in the public hearing was
 
00:35:59.870 --> 00:35:59.880 align:start position:0%
that pfas was included in the testing
 
00:36:02.270 --> 00:36:02.280 align:start position:0%
requirement so the amendment removes all
 
00:36:05.510 --> 00:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
pfas it's only included in the Des
 
00:36:09.170 --> 00:36:09.180 align:start position:0%
notification in fact the bill becomes
 
00:36:12.950 --> 00:36:12.960 align:start position:0%
almost a mirror image of House Bill 667
 
00:36:15.650 --> 00:36:15.660 align:start position:0%
which passed the house and the Senate
 
00:36:18.170 --> 00:36:18.180 align:start position:0%
back in 2020 but it died of covet death
 
00:36:19.609 --> 00:36:19.619 align:start position:0%
it couldn't it couldn't get the final
 
00:36:21.530 --> 00:36:21.540 align:start position:0%
vote before the deadline
 
00:36:25.069 --> 00:36:25.079 align:start position:0%
so this this is this is already a bill
 
00:36:27.829 --> 00:36:27.839 align:start position:0%
that's been debated and studied in both
 
00:36:29.930 --> 00:36:29.940 align:start position:0%
the house and the Senate a few years ago
 
00:36:31.430 --> 00:36:31.440 align:start position:0%
I don't think we would be able to
 
00:36:35.210 --> 00:36:35.220 align:start position:0%
improve upon that by retaining it so
 
00:36:38.569 --> 00:36:38.579 align:start position:0%
um perhaps after the amendment is shared
 
00:36:40.310 --> 00:36:40.320 align:start position:0%
um you may realize that it does address
 
00:36:42.109 --> 00:36:42.119 align:start position:0%
all the concerns that were brought up in
 
00:36:45.770 --> 00:36:45.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:47.569 --> 00:36:47.579 align:start position:0%
precisely why I was hoping we'd take up
 
00:36:49.069 --> 00:36:49.079 align:start position:0%
the other bill
 
00:36:52.250 --> 00:36:52.260 align:start position:0%
um you and I had spoken about that
 
00:36:54.650 --> 00:36:54.660 align:start position:0%
I think in a hallway conversation
 
00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:56.630 align:start position:0%
I think in a hallway conversation
uh

00:36:56.630 --> 00:36:56.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:36:58.430 --> 00:36:58.440 align:start position:0%
um well we do have emotion on the floor
 
00:36:58.440 --> 00:36:59.870 align:start position:0%
um well we do have emotion on the floor
so

00:36:59.870 --> 00:36:59.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:37:02.510 --> 00:37:02.520 align:start position:0%
um as far as I mean Mr chair if you
 
00:37:03.950 --> 00:37:03.960 align:start position:0%
don't mind me just making a remark about
 
00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:06.770 align:start position:0%
don't mind me just making a remark about
398

00:37:06.770 --> 00:37:06.780 align:start position:0%
398
 
00:37:09.470 --> 00:37:09.480 align:start position:0%
um I think that's the bill to retain
 
00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:11.810 align:start position:0%
um I think that's the bill to retain
yeah

00:37:11.810 --> 00:37:11.820 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:37:14.569 --> 00:37:14.579 align:start position:0%
I think we need to talk about the motion
 
00:37:16.970 --> 00:37:16.980 align:start position:0%
to itl so
 
00:37:20.450 --> 00:37:20.460 align:start position:0%
if there's nothing else on itl
 
00:37:27.589 --> 00:37:27.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:27.599 --> 00:37:29.450 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:37:29.450 --> 00:37:29.460 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:37:32.690 --> 00:37:32.700 align:start position:0%
um for the motion of
 
00:37:36.230 --> 00:37:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:39.349 --> 00:37:39.359 align:start position:0%
there's a motion going around now and I
 
00:37:41.930 --> 00:37:41.940 align:start position:0%
know we're in the middle of voting itl
 
00:37:44.450 --> 00:37:44.460 align:start position:0%
on 205.
 
00:37:47.750 --> 00:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
but representative McHugh had made a
 
00:37:49.849 --> 00:37:49.859 align:start position:0%
good point is it possible
 
00:37:49.859 --> 00:37:52.130 align:start position:0%
good point is it possible
to

00:37:52.130 --> 00:37:52.140 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:37:54.890 --> 00:37:54.900 align:start position:0%
get what we want or do are we stuck
 
00:37:56.870 --> 00:37:56.880 align:start position:0%
because of the order that this was
 
00:37:59.390 --> 00:37:59.400 align:start position:0%
presented to us
 
00:38:00.829 --> 00:38:00.839 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to take them
 
00:38:03.170 --> 00:38:03.180 align:start position:0%
representative wolf I appreciate your
 
00:38:04.849 --> 00:38:04.859 align:start position:0%
question but I'm not taking them out of
 
00:38:07.670 --> 00:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
order I think we vote on the itl if it
 
00:38:09.530 --> 00:38:09.540 align:start position:0%
doesn't pass then we'll entertain
 
00:38:12.589 --> 00:38:12.599 align:start position:0%
another motion it appears to me that
 
00:38:15.349 --> 00:38:15.359 align:start position:0%
representative McHugh will probably make
 
00:38:18.170 --> 00:38:18.180 align:start position:0%
a motion to retain if that doesn't pass
 
00:38:22.730 --> 00:38:22.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:24.170 --> 00:38:24.180 align:start position:0%
so we're going to stay in this order
 
00:38:29.450 --> 00:38:29.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:33.589 --> 00:38:33.599 align:start position:0%
so we're calling the roll call on itl of
 
00:38:38.210 --> 00:38:38.220 align:start position:0%
H Bill 205. share
 
00:38:39.970 --> 00:38:39.980 align:start position:0%

yes
 
00:39:40.010 --> 00:39:40.020 align:start position:0%
okay if I can count that's 10 10. so the
 
00:39:42.410 --> 00:39:42.420 align:start position:0%
motion fails so a representative McHugh
 
00:39:43.849 --> 00:39:43.859 align:start position:0%
did you have a second motion you'd like
 
00:39:46.670 --> 00:39:46.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:51.890 --> 00:39:51.900 align:start position:0%
a move that we retain House Bill 205
 
00:39:55.730 --> 00:39:55.740 align:start position:0%
a motion to retain House Bill 205 do I
 
00:39:57.230 --> 00:39:57.240 align:start position:0%
have a second
 
00:40:00.470 --> 00:40:00.480 align:start position:0%
second seconded by representative Harvey
 
00:40:02.150 --> 00:40:02.160 align:start position:0%
bolia do you wish to speak to your
 
00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:04.790 align:start position:0%
bolia do you wish to speak to your
motion

00:40:04.790 --> 00:40:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:06.470 --> 00:40:06.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:40:07.730 --> 00:40:07.740 align:start position:0%
um yeah for the reason I was stating
 
00:40:09.829 --> 00:40:09.839 align:start position:0%
before uh the bill does need a little
 
00:40:11.050 --> 00:40:11.060 align:start position:0%
bit of work
 
00:40:13.370 --> 00:40:13.380 align:start position:0%
and even with the amendment that I'm
 
00:40:16.550 --> 00:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
actually just still reading
 
00:40:19.790 --> 00:40:19.800 align:start position:0%
even with this amendment I still see
 
00:40:21.829 --> 00:40:21.839 align:start position:0%
some language that's
 
00:40:25.010 --> 00:40:25.020 align:start position:0%
far from objective that we actually
 
00:40:28.750 --> 00:40:28.760 align:start position:0%
address in an amendment
 
00:40:32.870 --> 00:40:32.880 align:start position:0%
that was sent out to the the chair and
 
00:40:35.270 --> 00:40:35.280 align:start position:0%
the vice chair and the ranking member uh
 
00:40:37.450 --> 00:40:37.460 align:start position:0%
in 398.
 
00:40:42.290 --> 00:40:42.300 align:start position:0%
so I'd like to retain this bill to work
 
00:40:43.970 --> 00:40:43.980 align:start position:0%
on that language
 
00:40:46.490 --> 00:40:46.500 align:start position:0%
there's already some mandatory testing
 
00:40:49.849 --> 00:40:49.859 align:start position:0%
on Wells and there's already uh Des
 
00:40:52.910 --> 00:40:52.920 align:start position:0%
notification for anybody within 500 feet
 
00:40:55.609 --> 00:40:55.619 align:start position:0%
and there's already
 
00:40:58.130 --> 00:40:58.140 align:start position:0%
um widespread notification of pfas
 
00:40:59.510 --> 00:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
contaminants throughout New Hampshire on
 
00:41:01.130 --> 00:41:01.140 align:start position:0%
the Des website
 
00:41:03.710 --> 00:41:03.720 align:start position:0%
so I think we should consider retaining
 
00:41:05.089 --> 00:41:05.099 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:41:06.770 --> 00:41:06.780 align:start position:0%
and I urge the committee to support a
 
00:41:10.790 --> 00:41:10.800 align:start position:0%
motion to retain so we can further
 
00:41:13.010 --> 00:41:13.020 align:start position:0%
consider the exact right language of
 
00:41:15.170 --> 00:41:15.180 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:41:16.550 --> 00:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:41:19.370 --> 00:41:19.380 align:start position:0%
this is the second wish to speak
 
00:41:21.950 --> 00:41:21.960 align:start position:0%
no thank you I think representative
 
00:41:24.890 --> 00:41:24.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:27.230 --> 00:41:27.240 align:start position:0%
representative Darby
 
00:41:29.270 --> 00:41:29.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:41:32.270 --> 00:41:32.280 align:start position:0%
um so I would definitely uh recommend or
 
00:41:34.970 --> 00:41:34.980 align:start position:0%
suggest we vote against retaining this
 
00:41:34.980 --> 00:41:35.810 align:start position:0%
suggest we vote against retaining this
bill

00:41:35.810 --> 00:41:35.820 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:41:39.490 --> 00:41:39.500 align:start position:0%
um we we know that there is no Statewide
 
00:41:44.870 --> 00:41:44.880 align:start position:0%
testing of uh of wells and we know as uh
 
00:41:47.390 --> 00:41:47.400 align:start position:0%
as my colleague from Merrimack pointed
 
00:41:49.069 --> 00:41:49.079 align:start position:0%
out that
 
00:41:51.770 --> 00:41:51.780 align:start position:0%
um that Des supports this
 
00:41:54.650 --> 00:41:54.660 align:start position:0%
um the uh the well drillers support this
 
00:41:57.109 --> 00:41:57.119 align:start position:0%
the Realtors support the language that's
 
00:42:00.170 --> 00:42:00.180 align:start position:0%
in this bill and that this had at this
 
00:42:02.810 --> 00:42:02.820 align:start position:0%
the bill that this is based on as it was
 
00:42:06.530 --> 00:42:06.540 align:start position:0%
mentioned 667 passed on consent in 2020
 
00:42:08.870 --> 00:42:08.880 align:start position:0%
so I would definitely uh recommend to
 
00:42:10.370 --> 00:42:10.380 align:start position:0%
suggest that this does not require
 
00:42:10.380 --> 00:42:12.050 align:start position:0%
suggest that this does not require
additional

00:42:12.050 --> 00:42:12.060 align:start position:0%
additional
 
00:42:15.230 --> 00:42:15.240 align:start position:0%
um clarification in terms of the uh in
 
00:42:18.290 --> 00:42:18.300 align:start position:0%
terms of the language and we can vote
 
00:42:21.250 --> 00:42:21.260 align:start position:0%
against retaining this thank you
 
00:42:24.589 --> 00:42:24.599 align:start position:0%
anyone else on the motion to retain
 
00:42:27.530 --> 00:42:27.540 align:start position:0%
representative wrong yes I'm I'm also
 
00:42:29.810 --> 00:42:29.820 align:start position:0%
against the motion to retain and I want
 
00:42:32.810 --> 00:42:32.820 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
00:42:36.050 --> 00:42:36.060 align:start position:0%
remind my colleagues that commissioner
 
00:42:38.329 --> 00:42:38.339 align:start position:0%
Scott in his letter to us dated January
 
00:42:41.950 --> 00:42:41.960 align:start position:0%
30th said HB 205 is very similar to HB
 
00:42:45.410 --> 00:42:45.420 align:start position:0%
667 that passed the House of
 
00:42:47.450 --> 00:42:47.460 align:start position:0%
Representatives in 2020 but was not
 
00:42:49.250 --> 00:42:49.260 align:start position:0%
considered by the Senate due to covet
 
00:42:50.930 --> 00:42:50.940 align:start position:0%
disrupting the regular legislative
 
00:42:53.450 --> 00:42:53.460 align:start position:0%
process significant work in
 
00:42:55.310 --> 00:42:55.320 align:start position:0%
collaboration between legislators
 
00:42:56.690 --> 00:42:56.700 align:start position:0%
industry and public health
 
00:42:59.569 --> 00:42:59.579 align:start position:0%
Representatives occurred on HB 667
 
00:43:01.849 --> 00:43:01.859 align:start position:0%
during multiple legislative work
 
00:43:04.250 --> 00:43:04.260 align:start position:0%
sessions while the bill was considered
 
00:43:06.770 --> 00:43:06.780 align:start position:0%
in the house the primary difference in
 
00:43:12.710 --> 00:43:12.720 align:start position:0%
HB 205 of 2023 versus HB 667 of 2020 is
 
00:43:14.809 --> 00:43:14.819 align:start position:0%
that pfas has been added to the list of
 
00:43:17.450 --> 00:43:17.460 align:start position:0%
contaminants that must be tested for a
 
00:43:19.370 --> 00:43:19.380 align:start position:0%
newly constructed Wells
 
00:43:21.890 --> 00:43:21.900 align:start position:0%
if we get to emotion with an amendment
 
00:43:24.470 --> 00:43:24.480 align:start position:0%
you'll see that all that pfas has been
 
00:43:26.569 --> 00:43:26.579 align:start position:0%
taken out in fact
 
00:43:29.329 --> 00:43:29.339 align:start position:0%
um with this with this amendment if we
 
00:43:33.890 --> 00:43:33.900 align:start position:0%
consider it will actually enable 205 to
 
00:43:39.470 --> 00:43:39.480 align:start position:0%
revert back to HB 667 and as
 
00:43:41.329 --> 00:43:41.339 align:start position:0%
commissioner Scott stated there's there
 
00:43:43.370 --> 00:43:43.380 align:start position:0%
was so much work done on that I don't
 
00:43:46.370 --> 00:43:46.380 align:start position:0%
see how a retain is going to make this
 
00:43:49.010 --> 00:43:49.020 align:start position:0%
better that the amendment already does
 
00:43:51.230 --> 00:43:51.240 align:start position:0%
so thank you I'm against the retained
 
00:43:51.240 --> 00:43:52.730 align:start position:0%
so thank you I'm against the retained
motion

00:43:52.730 --> 00:43:52.740 align:start position:0%
motion
 
00:43:55.069 --> 00:43:55.079 align:start position:0%
cue anyone else to speak on the motion
 
00:43:57.170 --> 00:43:57.180 align:start position:0%
to retain for the first time
 
00:43:59.690 --> 00:43:59.700 align:start position:0%
representative Vale
 
00:44:01.910 --> 00:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:44:04.849 --> 00:44:04.859 align:start position:0%
I also speak in against the motion to
 
00:44:06.829 --> 00:44:06.839 align:start position:0%
retain this bill
 
00:44:09.349 --> 00:44:09.359 align:start position:0%
and I you know I just really think that
 
00:44:11.089 --> 00:44:11.099 align:start position:0%
it's this is the time to get the
 
00:44:11.099 --> 00:44:12.770 align:start position:0%
it's this is the time to get the
standardization

00:44:12.770 --> 00:44:12.780 align:start position:0%
standardization
 
00:44:15.950 --> 00:44:15.960 align:start position:0%
out there for people that the insurances
 
00:44:18.710 --> 00:44:18.720 align:start position:0%
that people in New Hampshire need that
 
00:44:20.750 --> 00:44:20.760 align:start position:0%
they're preparing and their their
 
00:44:22.670 --> 00:44:22.680 align:start position:0%
supplying themselves with the correct
 
00:44:24.770 --> 00:44:24.780 align:start position:0%
filtration for the contaminants that
 
00:44:26.390 --> 00:44:26.400 align:start position:0%
they're facing
 
00:44:29.569 --> 00:44:29.579 align:start position:0%
um is isn't is a it's not something that
 
00:44:32.630 --> 00:44:32.640 align:start position:0%
can wait and what concerns me about
 
00:44:35.630 --> 00:44:35.640 align:start position:0%
retention is that there has been quite a
 
00:44:39.230 --> 00:44:39.240 align:start position:0%
bit of work done in this bill we have
 
00:44:42.410 --> 00:44:42.420 align:start position:0%
much support for the work that was done
 
00:44:46.010 --> 00:44:46.020 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 367 and I think we should
 
00:44:47.930 --> 00:44:47.940 align:start position:0%
go ahead with the agreed-upon language
 
00:44:52.190 --> 00:44:52.200 align:start position:0%
that um that came from House Bill 667
 
00:44:54.650 --> 00:44:54.660 align:start position:0%
and and we should pass this Bill thank
 
00:44:54.660 --> 00:44:55.730 align:start position:0%
and and we should pass this Bill thank
you

00:44:55.730 --> 00:44:55.740 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:44:58.609 --> 00:44:58.619 align:start position:0%
anyone new on retention representative
 
00:44:58.619 --> 00:45:00.770 align:start position:0%
anyone new on retention representative
Donnelly

00:45:00.770 --> 00:45:00.780 align:start position:0%
Donnelly
 
00:45:00.780 --> 00:45:02.329 align:start position:0%
Donnelly
um

00:45:02.329 --> 00:45:02.339 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:04.609 --> 00:45:04.619 align:start position:0%
Amendment and
 
00:45:06.109 --> 00:45:06.119 align:start position:0%
take out arsenic
 
00:45:07.970 --> 00:45:07.980 align:start position:0%
correct that we want to take arsenic out
 
00:45:10.010 --> 00:45:10.020 align:start position:0%
of this bill
 
00:45:11.930 --> 00:45:11.940 align:start position:0%
I don't have the amendment in front of
 
00:45:11.940 --> 00:45:13.069 align:start position:0%
I don't have the amendment in front of
me

00:45:13.069 --> 00:45:13.079 align:start position:0%
me
 
00:45:15.829 --> 00:45:15.839 align:start position:0%
could you pass it up no this one still
 
00:45:15.839 --> 00:45:19.370 align:start position:0%
could you pass it up no this one still
has

00:45:19.370 --> 00:45:19.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:23.210 --> 00:45:23.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:25.190 --> 00:45:25.200 align:start position:0%
we're not speaking on the amendment but
 
00:45:27.230 --> 00:45:27.240 align:start position:0%
what is the amendment can someone tell
 
00:45:28.550 --> 00:45:28.560 align:start position:0%
me the amendment number so we're all
 
00:45:30.410 --> 00:45:30.420 align:start position:0%
looking at the right Amendment sure
 
00:45:38.450 --> 00:45:38.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:42.410 --> 00:45:42.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:44.569 --> 00:45:44.579 align:start position:0%
through with arsenic
 
00:45:46.550 --> 00:45:46.560 align:start position:0%
point of order
 
00:45:48.109 --> 00:45:48.119 align:start position:0%
if we're not speaking about the
 
00:45:50.089 --> 00:45:50.099 align:start position:0%
amendment we're not speaking about the
 
00:45:54.230 --> 00:45:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:56.450 --> 00:45:56.460 align:start position:0%
when you motion to retain did you want
 
00:45:59.450 --> 00:45:59.460 align:start position:0%
to speak again representative McHugh
 
00:46:01.370 --> 00:46:01.380 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:46:04.849 --> 00:46:04.859 align:start position:0%
um if the if the bill takes out pfas I
 
00:46:07.069 --> 00:46:07.079 align:start position:0%
mean don't don't we want to keep it to
 
00:46:09.829 --> 00:46:09.839 align:start position:0%
get pfas in there I mean in that
 
00:46:12.050 --> 00:46:12.060 align:start position:0%
I mean that's the that's the fundamental
 
00:46:15.290 --> 00:46:15.300 align:start position:0%
concern at least for oh
 
00:46:15.300 --> 00:46:16.730 align:start position:0%
concern at least for oh
sense

00:46:16.730 --> 00:46:16.740 align:start position:0%
sense
 
00:46:18.410 --> 00:46:18.420 align:start position:0%
the last couple of years since this
 
00:46:22.490 --> 00:46:22.500 align:start position:0%
since 66 cents 667 excuse me die to Cove
 
00:46:25.130 --> 00:46:25.140 align:start position:0%
of death I mean pfas has become more and
 
00:46:28.430 --> 00:46:28.440 align:start position:0%
more of a concern and I think we want
 
00:46:32.210 --> 00:46:32.220 align:start position:0%
some discussion of pfas in the bill
 
00:46:34.309 --> 00:46:34.319 align:start position:0%
I mean that's the point of retaining it
 
00:46:37.930 --> 00:46:37.940 align:start position:0%
like we we agree on
 
00:46:42.170 --> 00:46:42.180 align:start position:0%
90 of this we may not agree on the exact
 
00:46:44.210 --> 00:46:44.220 align:start position:0%
language to be in stature what's in
 
00:46:47.329 --> 00:46:47.339 align:start position:0%
statute and what's in rules
 
00:46:49.010 --> 00:46:49.020 align:start position:0%
but let's let's get to a point I mean
 
00:46:50.690 --> 00:46:50.700 align:start position:0%
this isn't a this isn't is not an
 
00:46:52.190 --> 00:46:52.200 align:start position:0%
artificial retain so we can send it to
 
00:46:53.930 --> 00:46:53.940 align:start position:0%
interim study or whatever
 
00:46:56.809 --> 00:46:56.819 align:start position:0%
it's a it's truly an effort I mean this
 
00:46:59.390 --> 00:46:59.400 align:start position:0%
is a bipartisan issue especially for our
 
00:47:02.930 --> 00:47:02.940 align:start position:0%
town uh in Merrimack
 
00:47:05.329 --> 00:47:05.339 align:start position:0%
we want to do something about pfas and
 
00:47:07.730 --> 00:47:07.740 align:start position:0%
get something passed
 
00:47:11.930 --> 00:47:11.940 align:start position:0%
and we've got Amendment options
 
00:47:15.530 --> 00:47:15.540 align:start position:0%
on 398 in the numerical numerical order
 
00:47:20.870 --> 00:47:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:23.270 --> 00:47:23.280 align:start position:0%
so I'm I was a little surprised when you
 
00:47:25.010 --> 00:47:25.020 align:start position:0%
uh representative Rowan when you first
 
00:47:26.990 --> 00:47:27.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned that b fast came out because I
 
00:47:29.270 --> 00:47:29.280 align:start position:0%
think that's kind of the central issue
 
00:47:32.150 --> 00:47:32.160 align:start position:0%
here is is some standard or some testing
 
00:47:34.130 --> 00:47:34.140 align:start position:0%
or some notification or some combination
 
00:47:35.690 --> 00:47:35.700 align:start position:0%
of both
 
00:47:37.550 --> 00:47:37.560 align:start position:0%
on pfas
 
00:47:39.470 --> 00:47:39.480 align:start position:0%
so why
 
00:47:41.750 --> 00:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
why pass a bill
 
00:47:44.030 --> 00:47:44.040 align:start position:0%
without pfas in it
 
00:47:45.589 --> 00:47:45.599 align:start position:0%
I'm it's maybe it's a bit of a
 
00:47:47.210 --> 00:47:47.220 align:start position:0%
rhetorical question
 
00:47:53.089 --> 00:47:53.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:54.829 --> 00:47:54.839 align:start position:0%
thank you representative I'm going to
 
00:47:56.829 --> 00:47:56.839 align:start position:0%
represent recognize representative
 
00:48:00.650 --> 00:48:00.660 align:start position:0%
LaMontagne then representative Kelly yes
 
00:48:00.660 --> 00:48:01.370 align:start position:0%
LaMontagne then representative Kelly yes
I

00:48:01.370 --> 00:48:01.380 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:48:04.309 --> 00:48:04.319 align:start position:0%
similar concerns about that but one of
 
00:48:07.010 --> 00:48:07.020 align:start position:0%
the objections about including the pfas
 
00:48:10.130 --> 00:48:10.140 align:start position:0%
compounds and the standardized testing
 
00:48:12.230 --> 00:48:12.240 align:start position:0%
is that many people felt well it's not a
 
00:48:14.270 --> 00:48:14.280 align:start position:0%
problem everywhere in the state
 
00:48:17.329 --> 00:48:17.339 align:start position:0%
though it might be but that's why we
 
00:48:19.069 --> 00:48:19.079 align:start position:0%
want to include the really strong
 
00:48:22.010 --> 00:48:22.020 align:start position:0%
notifications about pfas and and the
 
00:48:24.290 --> 00:48:24.300 align:start position:0%
transactions so that we don't require
 
00:48:26.270 --> 00:48:26.280 align:start position:0%
everyone to do the much more expensive
 
00:48:29.750 --> 00:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
testing for pfas but if they see this
 
00:48:33.109 --> 00:48:33.119 align:start position:0%
warning then they say oh maybe I should
 
00:48:36.230 --> 00:48:36.240 align:start position:0%
get it it's not um mandating it but we
 
00:48:37.910 --> 00:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
wanted to keep the really strange strong
 
00:48:40.849 --> 00:48:40.859 align:start position:0%
language about pfas in the notification
 
00:48:42.470 --> 00:48:42.480 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:48:42.480 --> 00:48:43.190 align:start position:0%
and then
um

00:48:43.190 --> 00:48:43.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:45.770 --> 00:48:45.780 align:start position:0%
another thing is that the pfast testing
 
00:48:47.630 --> 00:48:47.640 align:start position:0%
is is a little bit fluid there's some
 
00:48:50.210 --> 00:48:50.220 align:start position:0%
new problems with the testing
 
00:48:52.790 --> 00:48:52.800 align:start position:0%
um there might be some contaminates in
 
00:48:55.309 --> 00:48:55.319 align:start position:0%
treatment systems representative run
 
00:48:56.870 --> 00:48:56.880 align:start position:0%
could speak more in detail about that
 
00:49:01.010 --> 00:49:01.020 align:start position:0%
but this bill establishes
 
00:49:04.370 --> 00:49:04.380 align:start position:0%
um standards for well testing without
 
00:49:07.790 --> 00:49:07.800 align:start position:0%
requiring pfas across the board though
 
00:49:10.790 --> 00:49:10.800 align:start position:0%
it could be added later as we learn more
 
00:49:14.569 --> 00:49:14.579 align:start position:0%
about it but this bill keeps a strong
 
00:49:17.690 --> 00:49:17.700 align:start position:0%
language about pfas in the notification
 
00:49:17.700 --> 00:49:19.250 align:start position:0%
language about pfas in the notification
that

00:49:19.250 --> 00:49:19.260 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:49:19.260 --> 00:49:20.150 align:start position:0%
that
um

00:49:20.150 --> 00:49:20.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:23.150 --> 00:49:23.160 align:start position:0%
if you you mentioned
 
00:49:25.490 --> 00:49:25.500 align:start position:0%
um that it might be they could go to the
 
00:49:28.490 --> 00:49:28.500 align:start position:0%
Des website and see information about
 
00:49:31.430 --> 00:49:31.440 align:start position:0%
pfas but most buyers aren't going to do
 
00:49:33.290 --> 00:49:33.300 align:start position:0%
that if they're going to get the
 
00:49:34.849 --> 00:49:34.859 align:start position:0%
notification with their real estate
 
00:49:37.069 --> 00:49:37.079 align:start position:0%
documents that's where we need to have
 
00:49:42.290 --> 00:49:42.300 align:start position:0%
an impact so that's representative Kelly
 
00:49:44.089 --> 00:49:44.099 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair yeah I'd just like to
 
00:49:46.670 --> 00:49:46.680 align:start position:0%
add that the bones of this bill caught
 
00:49:49.730 --> 00:49:49.740 align:start position:0%
date back to 2019 study commission this
 
00:49:51.290 --> 00:49:51.300 align:start position:0%
is what we got I think that it's
 
00:49:52.790 --> 00:49:52.800 align:start position:0%
important to pass this it's been four
 
00:49:54.829 --> 00:49:54.839 align:start position:0%
years already to pass this now get this
 
00:49:57.410 --> 00:49:57.420 align:start position:0%
in in statute and then worry about
 
00:50:00.589 --> 00:50:00.599 align:start position:0%
improving the bill with pfas
 
00:50:02.329 --> 00:50:02.339 align:start position:0%
with a separate bill nothing's stopping
 
00:50:03.410 --> 00:50:03.420 align:start position:0%
us from doing that with a separate bill
 
00:50:07.010 --> 00:50:07.020 align:start position:0%
next year I think also the EPA is about
 
00:50:08.530 --> 00:50:08.540 align:start position:0%
to release their
 
00:50:11.390 --> 00:50:11.400 align:start position:0%
recommendations around pfas and it's
 
00:50:12.770 --> 00:50:12.780 align:start position:0%
important to wait for that step but we
 
00:50:14.290 --> 00:50:14.300 align:start position:0%
shouldn't hold up the rest of the radon
 
00:50:17.210 --> 00:50:17.220 align:start position:0%
and uh and let in all Arsenic and all
 
00:50:19.910 --> 00:50:19.920 align:start position:0%
that stuff from from that part uh so
 
00:50:24.530 --> 00:50:24.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:26.930 --> 00:50:26.940 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to recognize myself for a
 
00:50:28.609 --> 00:50:28.619 align:start position:0%
comment I don't think we're all in
 
00:50:31.250 --> 00:50:31.260 align:start position:0%
agreement with the language of uh 205
 
00:50:34.309 --> 00:50:34.319 align:start position:0%
whether it's amended or not amended so I
 
00:50:36.530 --> 00:50:36.540 align:start position:0%
would be voting in favor of a retaining
 
00:50:39.530 --> 00:50:39.540 align:start position:0%
and knowing how we're likely to pass
 
00:50:42.770 --> 00:50:42.780 align:start position:0%
whatever we're going to do on 398 that's
 
00:50:46.609 --> 00:50:46.619 align:start position:0%
another reason colorly to support
 
00:50:50.510 --> 00:50:50.520 align:start position:0%
retaining 205 so if no one else has a
 
00:50:53.690 --> 00:50:53.700 align:start position:0%
question I'd like yes
 
00:50:55.910 --> 00:50:55.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I just run it real
 
00:50:58.370 --> 00:50:58.380 align:start position:0%
quickly go back to representative McHugh
 
00:51:00.710 --> 00:51:00.720 align:start position:0%
I do think that pfas has been very
 
00:51:02.930 --> 00:51:02.940 align:start position:0%
important and come to our attention
 
00:51:05.270 --> 00:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
especially in the last few years but I
 
00:51:07.370 --> 00:51:07.380 align:start position:0%
know in other communities in the state
 
00:51:11.030 --> 00:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
these um the other things that will be
 
00:51:12.770 --> 00:51:12.780 align:start position:0%
tested for that are on this list have
 
00:51:15.109 --> 00:51:15.119 align:start position:0%
been of concern across the state and
 
00:51:16.130 --> 00:51:16.140 align:start position:0%
other places so I think when
 
00:51:17.870 --> 00:51:17.880 align:start position:0%
stakeholders came together in the study
 
00:51:20.270 --> 00:51:20.280 align:start position:0%
commission they really were also
 
00:51:22.010 --> 00:51:22.020 align:start position:0%
interested in having standards across
 
00:51:24.049 --> 00:51:24.059 align:start position:0%
the state for the other issues that are
 
00:51:25.130 --> 00:51:25.140 align:start position:0%
in there
 
00:51:25.140 --> 00:51:28.970 align:start position:0%
in there
thanks

00:51:28.970 --> 00:51:28.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:30.890 --> 00:51:30.900 align:start position:0%
I'm going to ask for a call of the
 
00:51:32.809 --> 00:51:32.819 align:start position:0%
question on
 
00:51:36.290 --> 00:51:36.300 align:start position:0%
the motion to retain so can I ask the
 
00:51:41.569 --> 00:51:41.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:43.910 --> 00:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 205 motion retain

and I'll second that
 
00:53:25.190 --> 00:53:25.200 align:start position:0%

00:53:31.790 --> 00:53:31.800 align:start position:0%
20230734h representative Darby wish to
 
00:53:34.190 --> 00:53:34.200 align:start position:0%
speak on your Amendment motion yes thank
 
00:53:36.589 --> 00:53:36.599 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman so first first I'd like
 
00:53:37.730 --> 00:53:37.740 align:start position:0%
to start
 
00:53:41.650 --> 00:53:41.660 align:start position:0%
um by talking about the origins or about
 
00:53:44.809 --> 00:53:44.819 align:start position:0%
the differences between this amendment
 
00:53:48.170 --> 00:53:48.180 align:start position:0%
and the original House bill 205.
 
00:53:51.770 --> 00:53:51.780 align:start position:0%
um the original House Bill 205 had two
 
00:53:55.790 --> 00:53:55.800 align:start position:0%
additional statements in it one was it
 
00:53:59.870 --> 00:53:59.880 align:start position:0%
had pfas testing and a section on PBS
 
00:54:04.370 --> 00:54:04.380 align:start position:0%
testing and it had a um
 
00:54:06.650 --> 00:54:06.660 align:start position:0%
yeah sorry it had pfas testing we heard
 
00:54:10.010 --> 00:54:10.020 align:start position:0%
a lot of concerns about pfas testing
 
00:54:14.410 --> 00:54:14.420 align:start position:0%
both in terms of cost and terms of
 
00:54:16.750 --> 00:54:16.760 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
00:54:20.270 --> 00:54:20.280 align:start position:0%
the locations and the whether or not the
 
00:54:22.910 --> 00:54:22.920 align:start position:0%
p5's testing was needed Statewide the
 
00:54:25.190 --> 00:54:25.200 align:start position:0%
other change between this amendment and
 
00:54:28.609 --> 00:54:28.619 align:start position:0%
the original 205 is that
 
00:54:33.010 --> 00:54:33.020 align:start position:0%
um as as my colleague pointed out this
 
00:54:37.010 --> 00:54:37.020 align:start position:0%
strikes out the the explicit arsenic
 
00:54:37.020 --> 00:54:38.450 align:start position:0%
strikes out the the explicit arsenic
Clause

00:54:38.450 --> 00:54:38.460 align:start position:0%
Clause
 
00:54:41.150 --> 00:54:41.160 align:start position:0%
um from the from the notification
 
00:54:41.160 --> 00:54:42.190 align:start position:0%
um from the from the notification
language

00:54:42.190 --> 00:54:42.200 align:start position:0%
language
 
00:54:45.290 --> 00:54:45.300 align:start position:0%
it turns out that that arsenic Clause
 
00:54:48.170 --> 00:54:48.180 align:start position:0%
was also stricken in the bill that this
 
00:54:50.809 --> 00:54:50.819 align:start position:0%
was based on which is as we've been
 
00:54:54.230 --> 00:54:54.240 align:start position:0%
talking about 667 from 2020. the purp
 
00:54:57.049 --> 00:54:57.059 align:start position:0%
the reason that that specific Clause is
 
00:54:58.910 --> 00:54:58.920 align:start position:0%
stricken is because there's a much more
 
00:55:01.370 --> 00:55:01.380 align:start position:0%
comprehensive statement about water
 
00:55:04.549 --> 00:55:04.559 align:start position:0%
quality as a preface to the
 
00:55:06.650 --> 00:55:06.660 align:start position:0%
notifications it's called contaminants
 
00:55:09.670 --> 00:55:09.680 align:start position:0%
it starts on line 14 on page two it
 
00:55:12.410 --> 00:55:12.420 align:start position:0%
indicates contaminants common in well
 
00:55:15.829 --> 00:55:15.839 align:start position:0%
water what we heard is that different
 
00:55:18.410 --> 00:55:18.420 align:start position:0%
areas of the state are impacted by
 
00:55:18.420 --> 00:55:19.609 align:start position:0%
areas of the state are impacted by
different

00:55:19.609 --> 00:55:19.619 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:55:20.829 --> 00:55:20.839 align:start position:0%
um different
 
00:55:24.069 --> 00:55:24.079 align:start position:0%
not largely naturally occurring
 
00:55:26.829 --> 00:55:26.839 align:start position:0%
contaminants whether they're radon
 
00:55:30.470 --> 00:55:30.480 align:start position:0%
uranium Arsenic and
 
00:55:35.569 --> 00:55:35.579 align:start position:0%
um and Des has very specific uh Des has
 
00:55:35.579 --> 00:55:36.530 align:start position:0%
um and Des has very specific uh Des has
very

00:55:36.530 --> 00:55:36.540 align:start position:0%
very
 
00:55:38.990 --> 00:55:39.000 align:start position:0%
um very extensive information on the
 
00:55:40.430 --> 00:55:40.440 align:start position:0%
website which is called out on here
 
00:55:43.309 --> 00:55:43.319 align:start position:0%
about the New Hampshire well water test
 
00:55:45.589 --> 00:55:45.599 align:start position:0%
for home buyers and how to even
 
00:55:47.690 --> 00:55:47.700 align:start position:0%
um how to even check your results if you
 
00:55:49.430 --> 00:55:49.440 align:start position:0%
if you go down I've spent a lot of time
 
00:55:51.589 --> 00:55:51.599 align:start position:0%
on the New Hampshire Des website if you
 
00:55:53.089 --> 00:55:53.099 align:start position:0%
go down that you'll see that the page
 
00:55:55.730 --> 00:55:55.740 align:start position:0%
that they refer to talks about all of
 
00:55:59.210 --> 00:55:59.220 align:start position:0%
the contaminants that are listed on in
 
00:56:02.270 --> 00:56:02.280 align:start position:0%
section four of this bill however it
 
00:56:06.349 --> 00:56:06.359 align:start position:0%
does not call out pfas pfas is um you
 
00:56:09.010 --> 00:56:09.020 align:start position:0%
know is a is not a naturally occurring
 
00:56:11.329 --> 00:56:11.339 align:start position:0%
contaminant and that's why we had to add
 
00:56:13.510 --> 00:56:13.520 align:start position:0%
an explicit section into the
 
00:56:16.790 --> 00:56:16.800 align:start position:0%
notification portion of
 
00:56:19.309 --> 00:56:19.319 align:start position:0%
um of this document of this amendment
 
00:56:24.349 --> 00:56:24.359 align:start position:0%
for pfas to make sure to to ensure as as
 
00:56:27.670 --> 00:56:27.680 align:start position:0%
has been spoken to that home buyers are
 
00:56:31.730 --> 00:56:31.740 align:start position:0%
are aware that they pfas may in fact in
 
00:56:34.010 --> 00:56:34.020 align:start position:0%
fact infect their wall water the reason
 
00:56:36.290 --> 00:56:36.300 align:start position:0%
reason some people have asked you may
 
00:56:39.109 --> 00:56:39.119 align:start position:0%
have received an email about why radon
 
00:56:41.450 --> 00:56:41.460 align:start position:0%
and lead is left but we've stricken
 
00:56:44.569 --> 00:56:44.579 align:start position:0%
arsenic it's because if you read the um
 
00:56:46.910 --> 00:56:46.920 align:start position:0%
the radon notification it calls out
 
00:56:50.510 --> 00:56:50.520 align:start position:0%
radon in the air as the as the the first
 
00:56:52.730 --> 00:56:52.740 align:start position:0%
uh as an explicit
 
00:56:56.030 --> 00:56:56.040 align:start position:0%
um sort of source of radon exposure it's
 
00:56:58.010 --> 00:56:58.020 align:start position:0%
also in water it mentions in water but
 
00:57:00.230 --> 00:57:00.240 align:start position:0%
the first case it covers is an air
 
00:57:03.230 --> 00:57:03.240 align:start position:0%
similarly with lead lead is first
 
00:57:05.990 --> 00:57:06.000 align:start position:0%
described about as being as being a
 
00:57:07.970 --> 00:57:07.980 align:start position:0%
concern with respect to lead paint it's
 
00:57:09.410 --> 00:57:09.420 align:start position:0%
also in the water it can also be in
 
00:57:11.329 --> 00:57:11.339 align:start position:0%
water but lead paint and so we have to
 
00:57:13.010 --> 00:57:13.020 align:start position:0%
leave the lead because of lead paint we
 
00:57:14.270 --> 00:57:14.280 align:start position:0%
have to leave the raid on because of
 
00:57:17.329 --> 00:57:17.339 align:start position:0%
radon in the air the contaminants and
 
00:57:20.270 --> 00:57:20.280 align:start position:0%
common common in well water cover the
 
00:57:20.280 --> 00:57:21.950 align:start position:0%
common common in well water cover the
arsenic

00:57:21.950 --> 00:57:21.960 align:start position:0%
arsenic
 
00:57:24.290 --> 00:57:24.300 align:start position:0%
um and so this this
 
00:57:27.349 --> 00:57:27.359 align:start position:0%
um the language that's in here has been
 
00:57:30.430 --> 00:57:30.440 align:start position:0%
um has been uh
 
00:57:33.170 --> 00:57:33.180 align:start position:0%
verbally approved by Des it's been
 
00:57:36.250 --> 00:57:36.260 align:start position:0%
verbally approved by the um
 
00:57:40.549 --> 00:57:40.559 align:start position:0%
by the Realtors and we also heard in
 
00:57:43.010 --> 00:57:43.020 align:start position:0%
testimony that the well drillers
 
00:57:45.250 --> 00:57:45.260 align:start position:0%
supported 667
 
00:57:48.109 --> 00:57:48.119 align:start position:0%
and 205 without the pfas testing
 
00:57:51.290 --> 00:57:51.300 align:start position:0%
requirement so this this bill basically
 
00:57:54.010 --> 00:57:54.020 align:start position:0%
meets the um
 
00:57:57.770 --> 00:57:57.780 align:start position:0%
meets the the is agreed upon by the vast
 
00:57:59.450 --> 00:57:59.460 align:start position:0%
majority of
 
00:58:01.549 --> 00:58:01.559 align:start position:0%
um of constituents that are impacted by
 
00:58:03.470 --> 00:58:03.480 align:start position:0%
the the businesses that are impacted by
 
00:58:06.589 --> 00:58:06.599 align:start position:0%
it in organizations and I I urge you to
 
00:58:10.609 --> 00:58:10.619 align:start position:0%
pass vote Yes on this amendment thank
 
00:58:10.619 --> 00:58:15.309 align:start position:0%
pass vote Yes on this amendment thank
you

00:58:15.309 --> 00:58:15.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:17.270 --> 00:58:17.280 align:start position:0%
representative Kelly
 
00:58:18.770 --> 00:58:18.780 align:start position:0%
yeah I would just like to point out
 
00:58:20.569 --> 00:58:20.579 align:start position:0%
again that this mirrors the exact
 
00:58:22.790 --> 00:58:22.800 align:start position:0%
language from House Bill 667 which
 
00:58:26.390 --> 00:58:26.400 align:start position:0%
passed Edna unanimously in 2019 was the
 
00:58:27.549 --> 00:58:27.559 align:start position:0%
was the
 
00:58:31.370 --> 00:58:31.380 align:start position:0%
outcome of four work sessions and the
 
00:58:33.530 --> 00:58:33.540 align:start position:0%
the two key differences between this
 
00:58:36.470 --> 00:58:36.480 align:start position:0%
bill and that one are first that the the
 
00:58:39.770 --> 00:58:39.780 align:start position:0%
pfas notification which is rather soft
 
00:58:42.950 --> 00:58:42.960 align:start position:0%
language and second is the line 14 on
 
00:58:44.569 --> 00:58:44.579 align:start position:0%
page two
 
00:58:47.329 --> 00:58:47.339 align:start position:0%
um the notification it says uh
 
00:58:49.789 --> 00:58:49.799 align:start position:0%
harmful contaminants are found have been
 
00:58:51.230 --> 00:58:51.240 align:start position:0%
found in private Wells throughout New
 
00:58:53.089 --> 00:58:53.099 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that language is softened from
 
00:58:55.010 --> 00:58:55.020 align:start position:0%
the original bill which was something
 
00:58:56.930 --> 00:58:56.940 align:start position:0%
that was pointed out by the realtors
 
00:58:59.690 --> 00:58:59.700 align:start position:0%
association that the language originally
 
00:59:02.569 --> 00:59:02.579 align:start position:0%
said most private Wells and that
 
00:59:04.970 --> 00:59:04.980 align:start position:0%
language has been slightly softened
 
00:59:07.250 --> 00:59:07.260 align:start position:0%
um to to deal with their concerns so I
 
00:59:09.109 --> 00:59:09.119 align:start position:0%
would again urge all members to to vote
 
00:59:11.150 --> 00:59:11.160 align:start position:0%
for this and pass this just like we did
 
00:59:12.950 --> 00:59:12.960 align:start position:0%
in 2019
 
00:59:16.490 --> 00:59:16.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:19.190 --> 00:59:19.200 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm going to speak against the
 
00:59:20.690 --> 00:59:20.700 align:start position:0%
motion to amend
 
00:59:20.700 --> 00:59:21.349 align:start position:0%
motion to amend
um

00:59:21.349 --> 00:59:21.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:24.349 --> 00:59:24.359 align:start position:0%
very against the Striking of the
 
00:59:26.870 --> 00:59:26.880 align:start position:0%
notification of arsenic in my part of
 
00:59:28.609 --> 00:59:28.619 align:start position:0%
the state arsenic levels have been
 
00:59:31.549 --> 00:59:31.559 align:start position:0%
rising and I think it's important that
 
00:59:34.250 --> 00:59:34.260 align:start position:0%
the buyer be made specifically aware as
 
00:59:37.190 --> 00:59:37.200 align:start position:0%
he does about lead paint and radon of
 
00:59:40.549 --> 00:59:40.559 align:start position:0%
the Arsenic and although it's not before
 
00:59:43.970 --> 00:59:43.980 align:start position:0%
us immediately I think to combine this
 
00:59:46.670 --> 00:59:46.680 align:start position:0%
amendment with amendments that are
 
00:59:50.569 --> 00:59:50.579 align:start position:0%
related to House Bill 398 I'm against I
 
00:59:52.430 --> 00:59:52.440 align:start position:0%
think it needs work that's why I
 
00:59:54.530 --> 00:59:54.540 align:start position:0%
supported the retention so I'm going to
 
00:59:57.170 --> 00:59:57.180 align:start position:0%
vote against the motion to amend
 
01:00:00.049 --> 01:00:00.059 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to speak
 
01:00:01.789 --> 01:00:01.799 align:start position:0%
representative Iran
 
01:00:05.030 --> 01:00:05.040 align:start position:0%
yes I I just want to clarify a comment
 
01:00:07.010 --> 01:00:07.020 align:start position:0%
that representative Darby made that
 
01:00:08.930 --> 01:00:08.940 align:start position:0%
arsync was removed because it's
 
01:00:12.109 --> 01:00:12.119 align:start position:0%
redundant with language that is captured
 
01:00:15.589 --> 01:00:15.599 align:start position:0%
under the uh well water testing uh
 
01:00:18.970 --> 01:00:18.980 align:start position:0%
information that's provided through Des
 
01:00:23.030 --> 01:00:23.040 align:start position:0%
so the only things radon lead and pfas
 
01:00:25.309 --> 01:00:25.319 align:start position:0%
that are added to that paragraph
 
01:00:27.589 --> 01:00:27.599 align:start position:0%
following that paragraph are just items
 
01:00:30.950 --> 01:00:30.960 align:start position:0%
that aren't discussed in that well water
 
01:00:34.370 --> 01:00:34.380 align:start position:0%
so we could we could go on and on about
 
01:00:36.109 --> 01:00:36.119 align:start position:0%
mentioning a lot of things besides
 
01:00:38.089 --> 01:00:38.099 align:start position:0%
arsenic could be chloride could be
 
01:00:41.270 --> 01:00:41.280 align:start position:0%
sodium could be E coli but the
 
01:00:43.849 --> 01:00:43.859 align:start position:0%
notification is just the the first
 
01:00:46.190 --> 01:00:46.200 align:start position:0%
paragraph which captures Arsenic and
 
01:00:47.690 --> 01:00:47.700 align:start position:0%
other things and then three other things
 
01:00:49.730 --> 01:00:49.740 align:start position:0%
that aren't delineated in that well
 
01:00:52.730 --> 01:00:52.740 align:start position:0%
water testing information provided by
 
01:00:55.970 --> 01:00:55.980 align:start position:0%
Des to get to representative use issue
 
01:00:59.329 --> 01:00:59.339 align:start position:0%
before about why pfas was taken out in
 
01:01:02.270 --> 01:01:02.280 align:start position:0%
the original bill it it's specific fine
 
01:01:04.670 --> 01:01:04.680 align:start position:0%
for specific pfas which are currently
 
01:01:07.609 --> 01:01:07.619 align:start position:0%
under regulation by nhdes they have
 
01:01:07.619 --> 01:01:09.190 align:start position:0%
under regulation by nhdes they have
maximum

01:01:09.190 --> 01:01:09.200 align:start position:0%
maximum
 
01:01:11.930 --> 01:01:11.940 align:start position:0%
contaminant levels but we know in
 
01:01:14.750 --> 01:01:14.760 align:start position:0%
Merrimack that Sanko Bain has been using
 
01:01:18.289 --> 01:01:18.299 align:start position:0%
Gen X and that is something that perhaps
 
01:01:20.150 --> 01:01:20.160 align:start position:0%
by the Fall when we get more guidance
 
01:01:23.150 --> 01:01:23.160 align:start position:0%
from EPA when analytical methodology can
 
01:01:25.730 --> 01:01:25.740 align:start position:0%
be more specific to each pfas that's
 
01:01:25.740 --> 01:01:26.870 align:start position:0%
be more specific to each pfas that's
used

01:01:26.870 --> 01:01:26.880 align:start position:0%
used
 
01:01:30.190 --> 01:01:30.200 align:start position:0%
if this goes into statute it it would be
 
01:01:33.289 --> 01:01:33.299 align:start position:0%
more expedient and more accurate to
 
01:01:36.470 --> 01:01:36.480 align:start position:0%
amend it to keep current with current
 
01:01:39.410 --> 01:01:39.420 align:start position:0%
the current situation of pfas but right
 
01:01:42.530 --> 01:01:42.540 align:start position:0%
now even as this bill is not amended
 
01:01:46.549 --> 01:01:46.559 align:start position:0%
does not account for Gen X and
 
01:01:49.190 --> 01:01:49.200 align:start position:0%
um so I I'm holding in support of the
 
01:01:51.109 --> 01:01:51.119 align:start position:0%
amendment I think Granite Staters
 
01:01:53.569 --> 01:01:53.579 align:start position:0%
deserve to have consistent well water
 
01:01:57.109 --> 01:01:57.119 align:start position:0%
testing I think it's it's a shame that
 
01:01:59.510 --> 01:01:59.520 align:start position:0%
depending on you where you live is going
 
01:02:02.390 --> 01:02:02.400 align:start position:0%
to determine the quality of water that's
 
01:02:06.170 --> 01:02:06.180 align:start position:0%
tested coming from your well so I I hope
 
01:02:08.450 --> 01:02:08.460 align:start position:0%
everyone can you know consider voting in
 
01:02:10.849 --> 01:02:10.859 align:start position:0%
support of the amendment thank you
 
01:02:12.530 --> 01:02:12.540 align:start position:0%
on the amendment anyone else
 
01:02:15.589 --> 01:02:15.599 align:start position:0%
representative wolf
 
01:02:19.370 --> 01:02:19.380 align:start position:0%
yes Mr chairman if I can ask
 
01:02:22.370 --> 01:02:22.380 align:start position:0%
so you would prefer
 
01:02:24.049 --> 01:02:24.059 align:start position:0%
to see
 
01:02:27.109 --> 01:02:27.119 align:start position:0%
this bill without the Arsenic with the
 
01:02:30.230 --> 01:02:30.240 align:start position:0%
Arsenic notification in there even
 
01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:31.130 align:start position:0%
Arsenic notification in there even
though

01:02:31.130 --> 01:02:31.140 align:start position:0%
though
 
01:02:32.710 --> 01:02:32.720 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
01:02:35.510 --> 01:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
says that it has to be arsenic has to be
 
01:02:38.870 --> 01:02:38.880 align:start position:0%
tested in line 15.
 
01:02:41.870 --> 01:02:41.880 align:start position:0%
so there's not a specific notification
 
01:02:45.470 --> 01:02:45.480 align:start position:0%
on arsenic but it's in line 15 on the
 
01:02:47.750 --> 01:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
things that have to be tested for
 
01:02:51.470 --> 01:02:51.480 align:start position:0%
so would we not be improving the
 
01:02:54.349 --> 01:02:54.359 align:start position:0%
situation by passing that even though
 
01:02:58.490 --> 01:02:58.500 align:start position:0%
you don't have that extra layer of
 
01:02:58.500 --> 01:03:03.010 align:start position:0%
you don't have that extra layer of
notification

01:03:03.010 --> 01:03:03.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:05.210 --> 01:03:05.220 align:start position:0%
representative wolf my answer that would
 
01:03:07.849 --> 01:03:07.859 align:start position:0%
be no so I think you need to have the
 
01:03:09.589 --> 01:03:09.599 align:start position:0%
Arsenic because
 
01:03:11.690 --> 01:03:11.700 align:start position:0%
um representative Darby's mixed two
 
01:03:13.549 --> 01:03:13.559 align:start position:0%
bills basically together the
 
01:03:15.530 --> 01:03:15.540 align:start position:0%
notification well I'm looking at the
 
01:03:18.650 --> 01:03:18.660 align:start position:0%
amendment that was put forth and it
 
01:03:20.750 --> 01:03:20.760 align:start position:0%
talks about the notification of
 
01:03:25.370 --> 01:03:25.380 align:start position:0%
contaminants and Wells under 477 4A so
 
01:03:28.490 --> 01:03:28.500 align:start position:0%
that deletes arsenic so that's not about
 
01:03:31.250 --> 01:03:31.260 align:start position:0%
testing it's part of this bill as
 
01:03:34.190 --> 01:03:34.200 align:start position:0%
amended or the amendment is when you
 
01:03:35.990 --> 01:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
sell your house you give notifications
 
01:03:38.809 --> 01:03:38.819 align:start position:0%
to the buyers he's taken the arsenic out
 
01:03:40.910 --> 01:03:40.920 align:start position:0%
so that's why I'm not in favor of the
 
01:03:40.920 --> 01:03:43.490 align:start position:0%
so that's why I'm not in favor of the
amendment

01:03:43.490 --> 01:03:43.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:45.349 --> 01:03:45.359 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am
 
01:03:47.569 --> 01:03:47.579 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:03:50.150 --> 01:03:50.160 align:start position:0%
um can I ask a clarify clarifying
 
01:03:52.849 --> 01:03:52.859 align:start position:0%
question that might help so
 
01:03:55.130 --> 01:03:55.140 align:start position:0%
and I haven't been thoroughly exploring
 
01:03:58.609 --> 01:03:58.619 align:start position:0%
the Des website so if I were to go to
 
01:04:01.549 --> 01:04:01.559 align:start position:0%
the Des website and look up New
 
01:04:03.470 --> 01:04:03.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire well water test for home
 
01:04:07.069 --> 01:04:07.079 align:start position:0%
buyers would it say something on the
 
01:04:09.410 --> 01:04:09.420 align:start position:0%
website already explicitly about
 
01:04:13.430 --> 01:04:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:16.309 --> 01:04:16.319 align:start position:0%
does anyone yeah do
 
01:04:18.950 --> 01:04:18.960 align:start position:0%
thanks I don't know if we have any
 
01:04:21.890 --> 01:04:21.900 align:start position:0%
experts in the field to answer that that
 
01:04:21.900 --> 01:04:23.150 align:start position:0%
experts in the field to answer that that
the

01:04:23.150 --> 01:04:23.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:04:27.650 --> 01:04:27.660 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:30.589 --> 01:04:30.599 align:start position:0%
but I just point out that the amendment
 
01:04:33.650 --> 01:04:33.660 align:start position:0%
section one is about well testing with
 
01:04:36.349 --> 01:04:36.359 align:start position:0%
new well constructions not about the
 
01:04:38.569 --> 01:04:38.579 align:start position:0%
sale of your house that's the second
 
01:04:44.270 --> 01:04:44.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:46.190 --> 01:04:46.200 align:start position:0%
Mr chair members of the committee my
 
01:04:47.450 --> 01:04:47.460 align:start position:0%
name is Ted deers I'm the assistant
 
01:04:49.010 --> 01:04:49.020 align:start position:0%
director of The Water Division at the
 
01:04:49.849 --> 01:04:49.859 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Department of
 
01:04:53.210 --> 01:04:53.220 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services uh newham Des has
 
01:04:55.789 --> 01:04:55.799 align:start position:0%
come out in favor of these bills with
 
01:04:57.770 --> 01:04:57.780 align:start position:0%
various different suggestions and I
 
01:04:59.450 --> 01:04:59.460 align:start position:0%
think that the uh the amendment that
 
01:05:02.049 --> 01:05:02.059 align:start position:0%
representative Darby has put put forth
 
01:05:05.390 --> 01:05:05.400 align:start position:0%
largely consolidates uh the language of
 
01:05:11.089 --> 01:05:11.099 align:start position:0%
398 and 205 into one particular bill
 
01:05:13.490 --> 01:05:13.500 align:start position:0%
um indeed if you go to and I would just
 
01:05:15.710 --> 01:05:15.720 align:start position:0%
I I would I'll answer the answer I'll
 
01:05:17.630 --> 01:05:17.640 align:start position:0%
answer it directly your question
 
01:05:20.390 --> 01:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
directly and then I will just expand one
 
01:05:22.789 --> 01:05:22.799 align:start position:0%
bit on that in terms of how Des will
 
01:05:24.589 --> 01:05:24.599 align:start position:0%
react to this particular bill being
 
01:05:24.599 --> 01:05:25.789 align:start position:0%
react to this particular bill being
passed

01:05:25.789 --> 01:05:25.799 align:start position:0%
passed
 
01:05:28.730 --> 01:05:28.740 align:start position:0%
so the answer is absolutely yes if you
 
01:05:30.770 --> 01:05:30.780 align:start position:0%
go to the New Hampshire well test and if
 
01:05:33.710 --> 01:05:33.720 align:start position:0%
you go to the to be well informed uh
 
01:05:35.690 --> 01:05:35.700 align:start position:0%
parts of our website you will find
 
01:05:38.270 --> 01:05:38.280 align:start position:0%
really good information written for
 
01:05:40.970 --> 01:05:40.980 align:start position:0%
homeowners about the constituents that
 
01:05:44.270 --> 01:05:44.280 align:start position:0%
are listed uh in the amendment from
 
01:05:48.410 --> 01:05:48.420 align:start position:0%
lines uh first page lines 15 through 29.
 
01:05:50.210 --> 01:05:50.220 align:start position:0%
each of those and to to take
 
01:05:52.910 --> 01:05:52.920 align:start position:0%
Representatives harbes comment directly
 
01:05:54.230 --> 01:05:54.240 align:start position:0%
because it's very it's something I'm
 
01:05:55.849 --> 01:05:55.859 align:start position:0%
sensitive to as well
 
01:05:58.370 --> 01:05:58.380 align:start position:0%
is that in your particular area of the
 
01:06:00.650 --> 01:06:00.660 align:start position:0%
state arsenic is a problem I happen to
 
01:06:02.150 --> 01:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
be putting a well in somewhere where
 
01:06:05.089 --> 01:06:05.099 align:start position:0%
radon is most likely a problem
 
01:06:06.890 --> 01:06:06.900 align:start position:0%
um I just talked with somebody for whom
 
01:06:08.630 --> 01:06:08.640 align:start position:0%
hardness is a problem in their
 
01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:10.030 align:start position:0%
hardness is a problem in their
neighborhood

01:06:10.030 --> 01:06:10.040 align:start position:0%
neighborhood
 
01:06:12.950 --> 01:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
and I have also talked recently with
 
01:06:14.390 --> 01:06:14.400 align:start position:0%
some folks who have had really bad
 
01:06:16.190 --> 01:06:16.200 align:start position:0%
problems with manganese
 
01:06:18.829 --> 01:06:18.839 align:start position:0%
in their particular neighborhood and
 
01:06:20.750 --> 01:06:20.760 align:start position:0%
this is the complicating factor in all
 
01:06:23.390 --> 01:06:23.400 align:start position:0%
of this is that um it gets confusing for
 
01:06:25.609 --> 01:06:25.619 align:start position:0%
everyone uh to understand the
 
01:06:26.990 --> 01:06:27.000 align:start position:0%
differences between those various
 
01:06:29.930 --> 01:06:29.940 align:start position:0%
analytes that's why I think that this uh
 
01:06:31.609 --> 01:06:31.619 align:start position:0%
the conversation that occurred both in
 
01:06:35.569 --> 01:06:35.579 align:start position:0%
667 the conversation around 398 and the
 
01:06:39.109 --> 01:06:39.119 align:start position:0%
conversation around 208 205 gravitated
 
01:06:41.210 --> 01:06:41.220 align:start position:0%
back to this idea of let's have a common
 
01:06:43.130 --> 01:06:43.140 align:start position:0%
frame of reference and that's this be
 
01:06:47.690 --> 01:06:47.700 align:start position:0%
well informed area what will Des do with
 
01:06:50.510 --> 01:06:50.520 align:start position:0%
this if this bill is passed I can tell
 
01:06:51.950 --> 01:06:51.960 align:start position:0%
you that one of the things that we will
 
01:06:54.349 --> 01:06:54.359 align:start position:0%
do is that we're going to do a lot of
 
01:06:56.510 --> 01:06:56.520 align:start position:0%
work within our website and also the
 
01:06:58.549 --> 01:06:58.559 align:start position:0%
Outreach that we do to through our well
 
01:07:00.289 --> 01:07:00.299 align:start position:0%
drillers and through the well drilling
 
01:07:03.190 --> 01:07:03.200 align:start position:0%
board through the water well board sorry
 
01:07:07.069 --> 01:07:07.079 align:start position:0%
to do Outreach on this to ensure that
 
01:07:09.589 --> 01:07:09.599 align:start position:0%
the messaging that goes out about how
 
01:07:12.170 --> 01:07:12.180 align:start position:0%
people get to this website how they
 
01:07:13.789 --> 01:07:13.799 align:start position:0%
understand the information that's in
 
01:07:15.770 --> 01:07:15.780 align:start position:0%
there how they actually can get those
 
01:07:17.930 --> 01:07:17.940 align:start position:0%
resource is from other sources as well
 
01:07:20.510 --> 01:07:20.520 align:start position:0%
from their own well drillers will be
 
01:07:23.150 --> 01:07:23.160 align:start position:0%
consistent it will be consistent with
 
01:07:25.490 --> 01:07:25.500 align:start position:0%
the language that's in this bill it'll
 
01:07:28.370 --> 01:07:28.380 align:start position:0%
be consistently labeled it'll be easier
 
01:07:31.010 --> 01:07:31.020 align:start position:0%
to find and it'll be elevated within our
 
01:07:34.069 --> 01:07:34.079 align:start position:0%
website to make sure that as people come
 
01:07:35.809 --> 01:07:35.819 align:start position:0%
into this situation that they can
 
01:07:38.870 --> 01:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
understand what's going on when they get
 
01:07:41.270 --> 01:07:41.280 align:start position:0%
a relatively you know I think for most
 
01:07:43.789 --> 01:07:43.799 align:start position:0%
humans a relatively complicated set of
 
01:07:45.589 --> 01:07:45.599 align:start position:0%
test results it's going to be very
 
01:07:48.589 --> 01:07:48.599 align:start position:0%
important for them to to do that so I
 
01:07:50.569 --> 01:07:50.579 align:start position:0%
just want to note that those those are
 
01:07:52.970 --> 01:07:52.980 align:start position:0%
kind of how we will react
 
01:07:55.250 --> 01:07:55.260 align:start position:0%
um in order to make sure that I think
 
01:07:58.370 --> 01:07:58.380 align:start position:0%
representative harb's concern is
 
01:08:00.710 --> 01:08:00.720 align:start position:0%
addressed that people clearly understand
 
01:08:04.670 --> 01:08:04.680 align:start position:0%
what arsenic or chloride or manganese or
 
01:08:07.789 --> 01:08:07.799 align:start position:0%
radon means for them in their particular
 
01:08:07.799 --> 01:08:11.210 align:start position:0%
radon means for them in their particular
domicile

01:08:11.210 --> 01:08:11.220 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:15.170 --> 01:08:15.180 align:start position:0%
anyone have any questions for Mr deers
 
01:08:17.570 --> 01:08:17.580 align:start position:0%
representative Harvey bolio
 
01:08:19.789 --> 01:08:19.799 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr deers
 
01:08:22.010 --> 01:08:22.020 align:start position:0%
um I had a conversation with somebody
 
01:08:23.390 --> 01:08:23.400 align:start position:0%
from Rules
 
01:08:26.510 --> 01:08:26.520 align:start position:0%
and I noticed on this amendment that
 
01:08:28.010 --> 01:08:28.020 align:start position:0%
there's an awful lot of specific
 
01:08:30.110 --> 01:08:30.120 align:start position:0%
information about
 
01:08:32.570 --> 01:08:32.580 align:start position:0%
directing people to a website a specific
 
01:08:34.610 --> 01:08:34.620 align:start position:0%
web page
 
01:08:34.620 --> 01:08:35.990 align:start position:0%
web page
Etc

01:08:35.990 --> 01:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
Etc
 
01:08:39.769 --> 01:08:39.779 align:start position:0%
my concern with this is that a lot of
 
01:08:42.349 --> 01:08:42.359 align:start position:0%
this verbiage in here
 
01:08:47.150 --> 01:08:47.160 align:start position:0%
really should say you know rule the New
 
01:08:50.209 --> 01:08:50.219 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Des should be uh setting the
 
01:08:52.910 --> 01:08:52.920 align:start position:0%
the language as far as the form because
 
01:08:54.709 --> 01:08:54.719 align:start position:0%
in 10 years
 
01:08:58.490 --> 01:08:58.500 align:start position:0%
you may have re you know redone your
 
01:08:58.500 --> 01:09:00.470 align:start position:0%
you may have re you know redone your
website

01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
website
 
01:09:02.390 --> 01:09:02.400 align:start position:0%
there could be a lot of there's going to
 
01:09:04.490 --> 01:09:04.500 align:start position:0%
be changes in this whole section over
 
01:09:07.550 --> 01:09:07.560 align:start position:0%
time so I that's one of my concerns with
 
01:09:10.309 --> 01:09:10.319 align:start position:0%
this is that it is
 
01:09:12.789 --> 01:09:12.799 align:start position:0%
a lot of this stuff should be sort of
 
01:09:16.370 --> 01:09:16.380 align:start position:0%
hashed out in rules all the details and
 
01:09:18.490 --> 01:09:18.500 align:start position:0%
directing people here and there and
 
01:09:21.110 --> 01:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
telling people how to to access things
 
01:09:23.329 --> 01:09:23.339 align:start position:0%
thank you that's I just wondered if you
 
01:09:26.150 --> 01:09:26.160 align:start position:0%
had any comment on that thanks
 
01:09:28.010 --> 01:09:28.020 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative I think it's
 
01:09:31.010 --> 01:09:31.020 align:start position:0%
a great question this is a common
 
01:09:31.020 --> 01:09:31.610 align:start position:0%
a great question this is a common
um

01:09:31.610 --> 01:09:31.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:35.209 --> 01:09:35.219 align:start position:0%
back and forth uh Evan flow that occurs
 
01:09:38.090 --> 01:09:38.100 align:start position:0%
I think uh here uh in this committee as
 
01:09:40.070 --> 01:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
well as others related to the role of
 
01:09:42.530 --> 01:09:42.540 align:start position:0%
Statute versus rule
 
01:09:45.530 --> 01:09:45.540 align:start position:0%
um clearly uh when we have something in
 
01:09:49.550 --> 01:09:49.560 align:start position:0%
rule it's it is very it is something in
 
01:09:50.930 --> 01:09:50.940 align:start position:0%
statute it means that's what we're gonna
 
01:09:50.940 --> 01:09:52.249 align:start position:0%
statute it means that's what we're gonna
do

01:09:52.249 --> 01:09:52.259 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:09:54.830 --> 01:09:54.840 align:start position:0%
very clearly within rule there's
 
01:09:56.930 --> 01:09:56.940 align:start position:0%
abilities to waive there's abilities to
 
01:09:59.030 --> 01:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
get to do other things there's it but
 
01:10:00.350 --> 01:10:00.360 align:start position:0%
like you said there's some more
 
01:10:00.360 --> 01:10:01.850 align:start position:0%
like you said there's some more
flexibility

01:10:01.850 --> 01:10:01.860 align:start position:0%
flexibility
 
01:10:04.250 --> 01:10:04.260 align:start position:0%
The Way We have dealt with this in the
 
01:10:06.290 --> 01:10:06.300 align:start position:0%
past because this has occurred in the
 
01:10:08.450 --> 01:10:08.460 align:start position:0%
past I mean we've had websites for
 
01:10:12.650 --> 01:10:12.660 align:start position:0%
you know nion 30 years here that
 
01:10:14.870 --> 01:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
um there's there's often ways that we
 
01:10:17.150 --> 01:10:17.160 align:start position:0%
can redirect there can be redirects
 
01:10:19.370 --> 01:10:19.380 align:start position:0%
especially if it's in statute we can
 
01:10:20.990 --> 01:10:21.000 align:start position:0%
create redirects and that that's a
 
01:10:22.610 --> 01:10:22.620 align:start position:0%
technology issue that's relatively
 
01:10:24.890 --> 01:10:24.900 align:start position:0%
straightforward to address
 
01:10:26.810 --> 01:10:26.820 align:start position:0%
um and and frankly my guess is is that
 
01:10:29.990 --> 01:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
over the next 10 years or or whatever
 
01:10:32.270 --> 01:10:32.280 align:start position:0%
um most likely this issue will come back
 
01:10:35.209 --> 01:10:35.219 align:start position:0%
to you all and uh I think you already
 
01:10:37.790 --> 01:10:37.800 align:start position:0%
heard from representative wrong that as
 
01:10:41.270 --> 01:10:41.280 align:start position:0%
the world of pfas becomes more
 
01:10:41.280 --> 01:10:42.370 align:start position:0%
the world of pfas becomes more
um

01:10:42.370 --> 01:10:42.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:45.890 --> 01:10:45.900 align:start position:0%
comprehensive and understood that there
 
01:10:48.169 --> 01:10:48.179 align:start position:0%
may be additional analytes that might be
 
01:10:49.610 --> 01:10:49.620 align:start position:0%
added to this at some point in the
 
01:10:49.620 --> 01:10:50.330 align:start position:0%
added to this at some point in the
future

01:10:50.330 --> 01:10:50.340 align:start position:0%
future
 
01:10:52.010 --> 01:10:52.020 align:start position:0%
so I I think that this is something
 
01:10:53.390 --> 01:10:53.400 align:start position:0%
that's going to be addressed by this
 
01:10:55.550 --> 01:10:55.560 align:start position:0%
committee over time and we would
 
01:10:56.990 --> 01:10:57.000 align:start position:0%
certainly work with the committee to
 
01:10:58.850 --> 01:10:58.860 align:start position:0%
make sure that however we do this
 
01:11:01.070 --> 01:11:01.080 align:start position:0%
whether it's in rule or statute and I
 
01:11:02.750 --> 01:11:02.760 align:start position:0%
would just say standing sitting here
 
01:11:04.390 --> 01:11:04.400 align:start position:0%
today we're agnostic
 
01:11:07.669 --> 01:11:07.679 align:start position:0%
but that we would you know we'll we'll
 
01:11:09.410 --> 01:11:09.420 align:start position:0%
make it work for however you all want to
 
01:11:13.610 --> 01:11:13.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:16.729 --> 01:11:16.739 align:start position:0%
representative McHugh question for Mr
 
01:11:18.830 --> 01:11:18.840 align:start position:0%
deers thank you Mr chairman thank Mr
 
01:11:20.810 --> 01:11:20.820 align:start position:0%
deers for taking my question
 
01:11:23.570 --> 01:11:23.580 align:start position:0%
um how does the department plan to
 
01:11:23.580 --> 01:11:25.189 align:start position:0%
um how does the department plan to
enforce

01:11:25.189 --> 01:11:25.199 align:start position:0%
enforce
 
01:11:27.229 --> 01:11:27.239 align:start position:0%
this since I see there's a violation and
 
01:11:29.930 --> 01:11:29.940 align:start position:0%
how do you define the unhealthy levels
 
01:11:33.169 --> 01:11:33.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:34.490 --> 01:11:34.500 align:start position:0%
wait make sure I have the right number
 
01:11:34.500 --> 01:11:38.390 align:start position:0%
wait make sure I have the right number
23

01:11:38.390 --> 01:11:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:41.390 --> 01:11:41.400 align:start position:0%
20 degree
 
01:11:45.370 --> 01:11:45.380 align:start position:0%
I'm not sh sure I'm looking okay
 
01:11:48.169 --> 01:11:48.179 align:start position:0%
so yeah though this is really this is
 
01:11:50.630 --> 01:11:50.640 align:start position:0%
really a good question in terms of
 
01:11:52.790 --> 01:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
things that go into
 
01:11:53.990 --> 01:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
um and I'm sorry it's hard to see around
 
01:11:55.430 --> 01:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
the speaker here
 
01:11:57.709 --> 01:11:57.719 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question and in
 
01:12:00.530 --> 01:12:00.540 align:start position:0%
terms of what would actually Des would
 
01:12:03.229 --> 01:12:03.239 align:start position:0%
enforce Des won't enforce Provisions in
 
01:12:05.750 --> 01:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
a a real estate contract
 
01:12:07.850 --> 01:12:07.860 align:start position:0%
that that is not something that Des has
 
01:12:10.550 --> 01:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
the ability to enforce so we don't have
 
01:12:12.890 --> 01:12:12.900 align:start position:0%
that kind of ability that's something
 
01:12:16.010 --> 01:12:16.020 align:start position:0%
that happens between realtor client
 
01:12:18.709 --> 01:12:18.719 align:start position:0%
closing mortgage all of the different
 
01:12:20.590 --> 01:12:20.600 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:12:23.270 --> 01:12:23.280 align:start position:0%
mechanisms by which people buy and sell
 
01:12:25.490 --> 01:12:25.500 align:start position:0%
property in the state so that is not
 
01:12:28.250 --> 01:12:28.260 align:start position:0%
something that Des enforces is part of
 
01:12:30.229 --> 01:12:30.239 align:start position:0%
real estate documentation we don't have
 
01:12:33.050 --> 01:12:33.060 align:start position:0%
ability to do that in terms of the
 
01:12:35.689 --> 01:12:35.699 align:start position:0%
testing we have a water well board the
 
01:12:37.490 --> 01:12:37.500 align:start position:0%
water well board would regulate what
 
01:12:39.709 --> 01:12:39.719 align:start position:0%
well drillers are doing and it would be
 
01:12:42.110 --> 01:12:42.120 align:start position:0%
largely based on you know when people
 
01:12:43.910 --> 01:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
would bring a complaint that they didn't
 
01:12:45.950 --> 01:12:45.960 align:start position:0%
get you know notified or something like
 
01:12:47.450 --> 01:12:47.460 align:start position:0%
that and that would go back to the water
 
01:12:49.370 --> 01:12:49.380 align:start position:0%
well board there's a way to deal with
 
01:12:50.510 --> 01:12:50.520 align:start position:0%
all of that
 
01:12:53.209 --> 01:12:53.219 align:start position:0%
in terms of the actual language on 23
 
01:12:55.550 --> 01:12:55.560 align:start position:0%
you know this is this is part of the
 
01:12:58.850 --> 01:12:58.860 align:start position:0%
whole setting of mcls this is the whole
 
01:13:02.090 --> 01:13:02.100 align:start position:0%
part of you know setting of agqs's it's
 
01:13:04.070 --> 01:13:04.080 align:start position:0%
this ongoing conversation I think it's
 
01:13:06.410 --> 01:13:06.420 align:start position:0%
representative wrong described about
 
01:13:09.890 --> 01:13:09.900 align:start position:0%
what levels are going to be harmful and
 
01:13:12.169 --> 01:13:12.179 align:start position:0%
that's going to change we know that
 
01:13:13.669 --> 01:13:13.679 align:start position:0%
that's going to change as new science
 
01:13:17.689 --> 01:13:17.699 align:start position:0%
happens as more more compounds are
 
01:13:17.699 --> 01:13:19.310 align:start position:0%
happens as more more compounds are
studied

01:13:19.310 --> 01:13:19.320 align:start position:0%
studied
 
01:13:22.250 --> 01:13:22.260 align:start position:0%
um as the industry stays you know a step
 
01:13:23.870 --> 01:13:23.880 align:start position:0%
ahead of all of this trying to make
 
01:13:25.790 --> 01:13:25.800 align:start position:0%
safer compounds and creating new ones
 
01:13:28.130 --> 01:13:28.140 align:start position:0%
that we don't know much about so this is
 
01:13:29.810 --> 01:13:29.820 align:start position:0%
all going to you know be changing over
 
01:13:32.390 --> 01:13:32.400 align:start position:0%
time which is why that language I think
 
01:13:35.090 --> 01:13:35.100 align:start position:0%
is is relatively I think it's okay
 
01:13:38.689 --> 01:13:38.699 align:start position:0%
language in that it it it it does uh
 
01:13:41.450 --> 01:13:41.460 align:start position:0%
point to you can have unhealthy levels
 
01:13:43.970 --> 01:13:43.980 align:start position:0%
and those will be defined
 
01:13:47.270 --> 01:13:47.280 align:start position:0%
differently over time uh so does that
 
01:13:49.430 --> 01:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
get at the the question that you had I'm
 
01:13:53.330 --> 01:13:53.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:55.370 --> 01:13:55.380 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you thank you for the
 
01:13:57.050 --> 01:13:57.060 align:start position:0%
follow-up no not at all so if I
 
01:13:59.390 --> 01:13:59.400 align:start position:0%
understand it correctly uh it's a moving
 
01:14:01.189 --> 01:14:01.199 align:start position:0%
Target I think I heard you say or it's a
 
01:14:02.570 --> 01:14:02.580 align:start position:0%
it's going to change and it's going to
 
01:14:04.070 --> 01:14:04.080 align:start position:0%
be different over time those unhealthy
 
01:14:09.350 --> 01:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
levels so you'll have to adjust how you
 
01:14:12.050 --> 01:14:12.060 align:start position:0%
how what those unhealthy levels are
 
01:14:14.209 --> 01:14:14.219 align:start position:0%
referred to in line 23.
 
01:14:18.490 --> 01:14:18.500 align:start position:0%
and testing the wells
 
01:14:21.350 --> 01:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
you have a way to enforce testing the
 
01:14:22.790 --> 01:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
wells but with all this additional
 
01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:24.110 align:start position:0%
wells but with all this additional
testing

01:14:24.110 --> 01:14:24.120 align:start position:0%
testing
 
01:14:26.450 --> 01:14:26.460 align:start position:0%
sounds like we need a fiscal analysis
 
01:14:28.130 --> 01:14:28.140 align:start position:0%
and we need in this budget year we need
 
01:14:29.750 --> 01:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
to appropriate some funds to help you
 
01:14:32.209 --> 01:14:32.219 align:start position:0%
Monitor and enforce
 
01:14:34.370 --> 01:14:34.380 align:start position:0%
all this additional testing I don't see
 
01:14:36.350 --> 01:14:36.360 align:start position:0%
a fiscal note attached to either the
 
01:14:38.930 --> 01:14:38.940 align:start position:0%
original bill or the amendment so should
 
01:14:41.630 --> 01:14:41.640 align:start position:0%
we ask for a fiscal note or can you guys
 
01:14:43.970 --> 01:14:43.980 align:start position:0%
perform a fiscal analysis for us
 
01:14:46.070 --> 01:14:46.080 align:start position:0%
well I I can tell you the amendment
 
01:14:47.689 --> 01:14:47.699 align:start position:0%
thank you for asking the question I
 
01:14:49.250 --> 01:14:49.260 align:start position:0%
don't know that a fiscal note is
 
01:14:50.990 --> 01:14:51.000 align:start position:0%
necessary because this data does not
 
01:14:52.669 --> 01:14:52.679 align:start position:0%
come to Des
 
01:14:56.630 --> 01:14:56.640 align:start position:0%
is data that goes to the buyer
 
01:14:59.030 --> 01:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
from the seller or or however that's
 
01:15:00.590 --> 01:15:00.600 align:start position:0%
working in the real estate transaction
 
01:15:03.050 --> 01:15:03.060 align:start position:0%
we don't get this data we will not be
 
01:15:05.030 --> 01:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
enforcing on this data
 
01:15:08.750 --> 01:15:08.760 align:start position:0%
so to the extent that someone has a
 
01:15:10.490 --> 01:15:10.500 align:start position:0%
problem they will be able to identify
 
01:15:12.229 --> 01:15:12.239 align:start position:0%
that and then work that out through the
 
01:15:14.630 --> 01:15:14.640 align:start position:0%
transaction to be able to sure that that
 
01:15:16.910 --> 01:15:16.920 align:start position:0%
their water is going to be okay so there
 
01:15:19.850 --> 01:15:19.860 align:start position:0%
really is not a role except within
 
01:15:21.530 --> 01:15:21.540 align:start position:0%
responding to complaints which is
 
01:15:24.169 --> 01:15:24.179 align:start position:0%
something that we already do so I'm not
 
01:15:26.030 --> 01:15:26.040 align:start position:0%
sure that there's a need for an
 
01:15:27.530 --> 01:15:27.540 align:start position:0%
additional physical note there's
 
01:15:29.689 --> 01:15:29.699 align:start position:0%
mechanisms to deal with all of those
 
01:15:32.810 --> 01:15:32.820 align:start position:0%
things already and and if there were a
 
01:15:35.209 --> 01:15:35.219 align:start position:0%
fiscal note we would be looking at
 
01:15:36.770 --> 01:15:36.780 align:start position:0%
whether or not
 
01:15:38.689 --> 01:15:38.699 align:start position:0%
there are going to be more complaints
 
01:15:41.330 --> 01:15:41.340 align:start position:0%
and how that would cost but that it's
 
01:15:42.709 --> 01:15:42.719 align:start position:0%
going to come out to be indeterminable
 
01:15:44.950 --> 01:15:44.960 align:start position:0%
because we have no idea so I I
 
01:15:47.510 --> 01:15:47.520 align:start position:0%
respectfully I I'm not sure that that
 
01:15:49.189 --> 01:15:49.199 align:start position:0%
would necessarily change the financial
 
01:15:49.199 --> 01:15:53.030 align:start position:0%
would necessarily change the financial
picture

01:15:53.030 --> 01:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:55.610 --> 01:15:55.620 align:start position:0%
anyone new
 
01:16:01.669 --> 01:16:01.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:04.790 --> 01:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
no okay okay Mr dears thank you very
 
01:16:06.709 --> 01:16:06.719 align:start position:0%
much for your testimony absolutely thank
 
01:16:12.110 --> 01:16:12.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:15.229 --> 01:16:15.239 align:start position:0%
Mr dot representative Darby
 
01:16:16.790 --> 01:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:16:18.350 --> 01:16:18.360 align:start position:0%
I want to make sure that we're on the
 
01:16:21.350 --> 01:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
same page about how this bill
 
01:16:24.830 --> 01:16:24.840 align:start position:0%
um relates to the original Bill House
 
01:16:28.790 --> 01:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
Bill 205. both bills had two sections
 
01:16:31.490 --> 01:16:31.500 align:start position:0%
the first section in both bills covered
 
01:16:34.189 --> 01:16:34.199 align:start position:0%
well testing the second section that's
 
01:16:36.110 --> 01:16:36.120 align:start position:0%
number two that starts on line six of
 
01:16:38.209 --> 01:16:38.219 align:start position:0%
page two had notification requires
 
01:16:41.209 --> 01:16:41.219 align:start position:0%
you'll notice that these these refer to
 
01:16:43.729 --> 01:16:43.739 align:start position:0%
very different rsas that's because one
 
01:16:46.189 --> 01:16:46.199 align:start position:0%
has to do with testing of new wells
 
01:16:48.830 --> 01:16:48.840 align:start position:0%
that's the entire first section testing
 
01:16:50.930 --> 01:16:50.940 align:start position:0%
of new wells only
 
01:16:53.450 --> 01:16:53.460 align:start position:0%
the second section which is which are
 
01:16:57.290 --> 01:16:57.300 align:start position:0%
existing tests affordable tests that can
 
01:16:59.330 --> 01:16:59.340 align:start position:0%
be done by a number of by the state
 
01:17:01.750 --> 01:17:01.760 align:start position:0%
laboratory and a number of
 
01:17:04.010 --> 01:17:04.020 align:start position:0%
commercial Laboratories across the state
 
01:17:07.010 --> 01:17:07.020 align:start position:0%
the second section talks about a
 
01:17:09.050 --> 01:17:09.060 align:start position:0%
notification required as you might
 
01:17:11.450 --> 01:17:11.460 align:start position:0%
require as people might recall the
 
01:17:14.450 --> 01:17:14.460 align:start position:0%
Realtors following the original hearing
 
01:17:16.430 --> 01:17:16.440 align:start position:0%
on this sent out what the notifications
 
01:17:19.310 --> 01:17:19.320 align:start position:0%
look like these are included in the
 
01:17:22.490 --> 01:17:22.500 align:start position:0%
um in the uh
 
01:17:22.500 --> 01:17:23.090 align:start position:0%
um in the uh
um

01:17:23.090 --> 01:17:23.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:26.209 --> 01:17:26.219 align:start position:0%
profits a p s statement and there's a
 
01:17:28.070 --> 01:17:28.080 align:start position:0%
list of the notifications this is
 
01:17:30.530 --> 01:17:30.540 align:start position:0%
basically going to replace the
 
01:17:33.290 --> 01:17:33.300 align:start position:0%
notifications that are
 
01:17:35.450 --> 01:17:35.460 align:start position:0%
um that are in the ex that are in the
 
01:17:37.729 --> 01:17:37.739 align:start position:0%
existing pns's that they send out today
 
01:17:40.550 --> 01:17:40.560 align:start position:0%
that's why this doesn't have a fiscal
 
01:17:42.830 --> 01:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
note on with respect to section two
 
01:17:45.229 --> 01:17:45.239 align:start position:0%
representative Darby are you speaking
 
01:17:47.030 --> 01:17:47.040 align:start position:0%
only about your Amendment yes yes
 
01:17:49.370 --> 01:17:49.380 align:start position:0%
absolutely only about my Amendment I'm
 
01:17:52.250 --> 01:17:52.260 align:start position:0%
talking about section two line six
 
01:17:56.209 --> 01:17:56.219 align:start position:0%
um of the amendment on page two
 
01:17:59.390 --> 01:17:59.400 align:start position:0%
this is only with respect to the
 
01:18:02.270 --> 01:18:02.280 align:start position:0%
notification section in the pns of real
 
01:18:04.729 --> 01:18:04.739 align:start position:0%
estate transactions there is no testing
 
01:18:07.130 --> 01:18:07.140 align:start position:0%
requirement or any cost associated with
 
01:18:09.530 --> 01:18:09.540 align:start position:0%
it thank you
 
01:18:10.910 --> 01:18:10.920 align:start position:0%
we're going to make a comment then I'm
 
01:18:13.250 --> 01:18:13.260 align:start position:0%
going to call this question
 
01:18:16.550 --> 01:18:16.560 align:start position:0%
um I heard Mr deers mentioned that be
 
01:18:19.189 --> 01:18:19.199 align:start position:0%
well informed had all of these things on
 
01:18:21.470 --> 01:18:21.480 align:start position:0%
the web page and notifications already
 
01:18:23.630 --> 01:18:23.640 align:start position:0%
so if I really followed that line of
 
01:18:25.910 --> 01:18:25.920 align:start position:0%
thinking we don't need any new statutes
 
01:18:28.370 --> 01:18:28.380 align:start position:0%
just tell people go look at the web page
 
01:18:32.930 --> 01:18:32.940 align:start position:0%
secondly I am concerned about the part
 
01:18:36.010 --> 01:18:36.020 align:start position:0%
two beginning on line six again because
 
01:18:40.490 --> 01:18:40.500 align:start position:0%
that relates to the same bill that is
 
01:18:44.030 --> 01:18:44.040 align:start position:0%
398 I have been advised that there may
 
01:18:47.689 --> 01:18:47.699 align:start position:0%
be a motion on 398 to retain so I don't
 
01:18:50.450 --> 01:18:50.460 align:start position:0%
know why we're not retaining this bill
 
01:18:53.209 --> 01:18:53.219 align:start position:0%
either and again I would vote against
 
01:18:55.970 --> 01:18:55.980 align:start position:0%
the amendment but I appreciate it being
 
01:18:58.010 --> 01:18:58.020 align:start position:0%
brought forth so I'm going to ask the
 
01:19:00.530 --> 01:19:00.540 align:start position:0%
clerk to call on the amendment this is a
 
01:19:02.750 --> 01:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
motion to amend you're either in favor
 
01:19:06.050 --> 01:19:06.060 align:start position:0%
or against can you call the role Madam
 
01:19:06.060 --> 01:19:10.610 align:start position:0%
or against can you call the role Madam
Clerk

01:19:10.610 --> 01:19:10.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:14.149 --> 01:19:14.159 align:start position:0%
um on the Amendments for 205 uh
 
01:19:17.689 --> 01:19:17.699 align:start position:0%
representative C no
 
01:19:20.090 --> 01:19:20.100 align:start position:0%
uh representative Colts
 
01:19:20.100 --> 01:19:21.410 align:start position:0%
uh representative Colts
no

01:19:21.410 --> 01:19:21.420 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:19:24.169 --> 01:19:24.179 align:start position:0%
representative Horgan no
 
01:19:27.110 --> 01:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
clerk votes no representative Healy no
 
01:19:29.570 --> 01:19:29.580 align:start position:0%
representative wolf no
 
01:19:32.209 --> 01:19:32.219 align:start position:0%
representative McHugh no representative
 
01:19:35.330 --> 01:19:35.340 align:start position:0%
Donnelly no representative done no
 
01:19:38.330 --> 01:19:38.340 align:start position:0%
representative Vale yes representative
 
01:19:42.370 --> 01:19:42.380 align:start position:0%
wrong yes representative Kelly yes
 
01:19:44.930 --> 01:19:44.940 align:start position:0%
representative Simpson yes
 
01:19:47.030 --> 01:19:47.040 align:start position:0%
representative Baldwin yes
 
01:19:50.390 --> 01:19:50.400 align:start position:0%
representative Darby yes representative
 
01:19:54.310 --> 01:19:54.320 align:start position:0%
Point yes representative LaMontagne yes
 
01:19:56.689 --> 01:19:56.699 align:start position:0%
representative Lovett
 
01:19:59.870 --> 01:19:59.880 align:start position:0%
yes representative Ryan yes and
 
01:20:01.610 --> 01:20:01.620 align:start position:0%
representative harp
 
01:20:05.209 --> 01:20:05.219 align:start position:0%
no okay so we got another 10 10. so now
 
01:20:07.790 --> 01:20:07.800 align:start position:0%
we go back to the simple motion of ought
 
01:20:10.130 --> 01:20:10.140 align:start position:0%
to pass made by representative rung
 
01:20:13.370 --> 01:20:13.380 align:start position:0%
seconded by representative Darby
 
01:20:15.530 --> 01:20:15.540 align:start position:0%
I believe we have to take a vote on that
 
01:20:17.689 --> 01:20:17.699 align:start position:0%
when anyone like to would you like to
 
01:20:20.870 --> 01:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
discuss your motion simply to pass
 
01:20:23.390 --> 01:20:23.400 align:start position:0%
not to pass as I said before I am
 
01:20:25.910 --> 01:20:25.920 align:start position:0%
disappointed the amendment failed it
 
01:20:27.530 --> 01:20:27.540 align:start position:0%
doesn't preclude a floor amendment to
 
01:20:30.470 --> 01:20:30.480 align:start position:0%
coming in what's critically important is
 
01:20:32.770 --> 01:20:32.780 align:start position:0%
to give Granite Staters
 
01:20:35.810 --> 01:20:35.820 align:start position:0%
consistent water testing when they are
 
01:20:38.750 --> 01:20:38.760 align:start position:0%
getting a new well we cannot tolerate
 
01:20:42.770 --> 01:20:42.780 align:start position:0%
having one town test for bacteria and
 
01:20:45.649 --> 01:20:45.659 align:start position:0%
another one testing for arsenic and lead
 
01:20:48.410 --> 01:20:48.420 align:start position:0%
I mean everyone deserves to have the
 
01:20:50.209 --> 01:20:50.219 align:start position:0%
same analytes tested when they're
 
01:20:52.970 --> 01:20:52.980 align:start position:0%
constructing a new well that is the
 
01:20:56.330 --> 01:20:56.340 align:start position:0%
heart of 205 that's what we need to get
 
01:20:56.340 --> 01:20:57.290 align:start position:0%
heart of 205 that's what we need to get
through

01:20:57.290 --> 01:20:57.300 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:21:01.910 --> 01:21:01.920 align:start position:0%
even if there's analysis for pfas
 
01:21:06.229 --> 01:21:06.239 align:start position:0%
it's not it's not going to take away
 
01:21:09.830 --> 01:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
um the ability for someone drilling a
 
01:21:12.890 --> 01:21:12.900 align:start position:0%
new well to get information on the
 
01:21:15.169 --> 01:21:15.179 align:start position:0%
quality of that water that could impact
 
01:21:17.510 --> 01:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
their health it could also influence
 
01:21:19.430 --> 01:21:19.440 align:start position:0%
things that they do in their home
 
01:21:21.290 --> 01:21:21.300 align:start position:0%
treatment systems they decide to install
 
01:21:24.229 --> 01:21:24.239 align:start position:0%
so I do urge my colleagues to vote ought
 
01:21:27.709 --> 01:21:27.719 align:start position:0%
to pass on this and let's do something
 
01:21:29.689 --> 01:21:29.699 align:start position:0%
good for the people of the state thank
 
01:21:29.699 --> 01:21:30.950 align:start position:0%
good for the people of the state thank
you

01:21:30.950 --> 01:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:21:36.110 --> 01:21:36.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:36.120 --> 01:21:37.370 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:21:37.370 --> 01:21:37.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:39.070 --> 01:21:39.080 align:start position:0%
I will agree that this is very important
 
01:21:41.810 --> 01:21:41.820 align:start position:0%
I think there's a lot of challenging and
 
01:21:44.510 --> 01:21:44.520 align:start position:0%
complexity in this bill that needs
 
01:21:48.290 --> 01:21:48.300 align:start position:0%
rewarding so I'm I'm hoping that we can
 
01:21:49.790 --> 01:21:49.800 align:start position:0%
come together to understand how we can
 
01:21:52.189 --> 01:21:52.199 align:start position:0%
really pull this together and you know
 
01:21:56.030 --> 01:21:56.040 align:start position:0%
Bill 398. it's I'm just I keep looking
 
01:21:57.770 --> 01:21:57.780 align:start position:0%
at this and go the complexity doesn't
 
01:22:00.290 --> 01:22:00.300 align:start position:0%
need to be as bad and it for the
 
01:22:02.330 --> 01:22:02.340 align:start position:0%
constituents for the people who drilling
 
01:22:04.610 --> 01:22:04.620 align:start position:0%
Wells for the people buying houses for
 
01:22:06.470 --> 01:22:06.480 align:start position:0%
them to have all this complexity to
 
01:22:08.990 --> 01:22:09.000 align:start position:0%
continue to try to sort through
 
01:22:10.850 --> 01:22:10.860 align:start position:0%
makes it difficult for them to
 
01:22:13.490 --> 01:22:13.500 align:start position:0%
understand what they need to do and yes
 
01:22:14.689 --> 01:22:14.699 align:start position:0%
I do agree that we should have
 
01:22:17.270 --> 01:22:17.280 align:start position:0%
consistency and and what the wells could
 
01:22:19.610 --> 01:22:19.620 align:start position:0%
be tested absolutely should be agree but
 
01:22:21.890 --> 01:22:21.900 align:start position:0%
let's do what's right for our
 
01:22:24.590 --> 01:22:24.600 align:start position:0%
constituents and really help make this
 
01:22:27.530 --> 01:22:27.540 align:start position:0%
clear and I'm in technology as far as I
 
01:22:29.450 --> 01:22:29.460 align:start position:0%
know websites will change we may not
 
01:22:31.130 --> 01:22:31.140 align:start position:0%
have websites in 10 years from now who
 
01:22:32.930 --> 01:22:32.940 align:start position:0%
knows what we're going to have you know
 
01:22:35.450 --> 01:22:35.460 align:start position:0%
trying to build in technology into any
 
01:22:38.450 --> 01:22:38.460 align:start position:0%
Bill bad to do because technology will
 
01:22:41.510 --> 01:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
always change so I would love for us to
 
01:22:43.729 --> 01:22:43.739 align:start position:0%
really work to make this simple for our
 
01:22:45.290 --> 01:22:45.300 align:start position:0%
constituents make it simple for the well
 
01:22:47.990 --> 01:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
drillers make it simple for Des let's
 
01:22:51.530 --> 01:22:51.540 align:start position:0%
look at simplifying and helping people
 
01:22:54.410 --> 01:22:54.420 align:start position:0%
instead of complexity thank you thank
 
01:22:54.420 --> 01:22:55.310 align:start position:0%
instead of complexity thank you thank
you

01:22:55.310 --> 01:22:55.320 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:22:57.709 --> 01:22:57.719 align:start position:0%
representative McHugh
 
01:23:00.110 --> 01:23:00.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I will be voting
 
01:23:02.209 --> 01:23:02.219 align:start position:0%
no against this ought to pass but
 
01:23:03.649 --> 01:23:03.659 align:start position:0%
representative wrong I I wouldn't
 
01:23:05.450 --> 01:23:05.460 align:start position:0%
preclude the possibility of a floor
 
01:23:06.890 --> 01:23:06.900 align:start position:0%
Amendment and I hope we can actually get
 
01:23:09.110 --> 01:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
398 passed so we at least get half a low
 
01:23:11.209 --> 01:23:11.219 align:start position:0%
for the notification
 
01:23:11.219 --> 01:23:11.870 align:start position:0%
for the notification
um

01:23:11.870 --> 01:23:11.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:13.850 --> 01:23:13.860 align:start position:0%
but there were some issues with the
 
01:23:16.070 --> 01:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
amendment unfortunately this still made
 
01:23:17.689 --> 01:23:17.699 align:start position:0%
it imperfect so I couldn't support the
 
01:23:17.699 --> 01:23:18.649 align:start position:0%
it imperfect so I couldn't support the
amendment

01:23:18.649 --> 01:23:18.659 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:23:20.390 --> 01:23:20.400 align:start position:0%
I hope we can sit down between now and
 
01:23:22.550 --> 01:23:22.560 align:start position:0%
the time this comes to the floor and
 
01:23:25.550 --> 01:23:25.560 align:start position:0%
consider what was make it make a better
 
01:23:26.810 --> 01:23:26.820 align:start position:0%
amendment I agree with representative
 
01:23:29.330 --> 01:23:29.340 align:start position:0%
Donnelly that we should do something to
 
01:23:31.250 --> 01:23:31.260 align:start position:0%
make it simpler correct some of this
 
01:23:32.990 --> 01:23:33.000 align:start position:0%
language I mean I still think there's a
 
01:23:34.610 --> 01:23:34.620 align:start position:0%
path forward I thought retention was the
 
01:23:37.610 --> 01:23:37.620 align:start position:0%
right way to go to give us the time you
 
01:23:39.830 --> 01:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that there were some
 
01:23:42.229 --> 01:23:42.239 align:start position:0%
things happening in the fall so the
 
01:23:43.430 --> 01:23:43.440 align:start position:0%
timing might have been actually right
 
01:23:46.669 --> 01:23:46.679 align:start position:0%
for retention but anyhow it's it's
 
01:23:48.050 --> 01:23:48.060 align:start position:0%
conceivable we can still get there I
 
01:23:49.729 --> 01:23:49.739 align:start position:0%
think 398 may get us part of the way
 
01:23:49.739 --> 01:23:50.950 align:start position:0%
think 398 may get us part of the way
there

01:23:50.950 --> 01:23:50.960 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:23:53.930 --> 01:23:53.940 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the way this bill is
 
01:23:56.270 --> 01:23:56.280 align:start position:0%
written uh in its original form and the
 
01:23:58.490 --> 01:23:58.500 align:start position:0%
way the amendment was I think we should
 
01:24:01.310 --> 01:24:01.320 align:start position:0%
probably keep arsenic in there that was
 
01:24:02.330 --> 01:24:02.340 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons I couldn't support
 
01:24:04.010 --> 01:24:04.020 align:start position:0%
that Amendment
 
01:24:05.330 --> 01:24:05.340 align:start position:0%
um I've seen arsenic in my own water
 
01:24:05.340 --> 01:24:06.649 align:start position:0%
um I've seen arsenic in my own water
actually

01:24:06.649 --> 01:24:06.659 align:start position:0%
actually
 
01:24:09.110 --> 01:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
um anyhow so I can't support it as it is
 
01:24:10.970 --> 01:24:10.980 align:start position:0%
couldn't support that that particular
 
01:24:12.890 --> 01:24:12.900 align:start position:0%
Amendment but I think we could probably
 
01:24:15.050 --> 01:24:15.060 align:start position:0%
get there I think we're pretty agreement
 
01:24:15.950 --> 01:24:15.960 align:start position:0%
I'd like to hear what some of the other
 
01:24:18.169 --> 01:24:18.179 align:start position:0%
uh representatives from Merrimack the
 
01:24:19.669 --> 01:24:19.679 align:start position:0%
one on this committee and the other
 
01:24:21.410 --> 01:24:21.420 align:start position:0%
members from Merrimack who actually
 
01:24:21.420 --> 01:24:22.490 align:start position:0%
members from Merrimack who actually
aren't

01:24:22.490 --> 01:24:22.500 align:start position:0%
aren't
 
01:24:26.270 --> 01:24:26.280 align:start position:0%
uh in in this particular room
 
01:24:27.830 --> 01:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:24:29.750 --> 01:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
anybody new
 
01:24:34.310 --> 01:24:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:37.310 --> 01:24:37.320 align:start position:0%
um I would like to see this bill passed
 
01:24:41.090 --> 01:24:41.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:43.490 --> 01:24:43.500 align:start position:0%
testing component it's just the
 
01:24:45.770 --> 01:24:45.780 align:start position:0%
notification so if someone gets a
 
01:24:48.229 --> 01:24:48.239 align:start position:0%
notification have your water tested
 
01:24:49.790 --> 01:24:49.800 align:start position:0%
once again they're going to have it
 
01:24:52.490 --> 01:24:52.500 align:start position:0%
tested and there are no standards they
 
01:24:54.590 --> 01:24:54.600 align:start position:0%
say oh I might have arsenic I might have
 
01:24:56.209 --> 01:24:56.219 align:start position:0%
something I'm going to have my water
 
01:24:56.219 --> 01:24:57.410 align:start position:0%
something I'm going to have my water
tested

01:24:57.410 --> 01:24:57.420 align:start position:0%
tested
 
01:25:00.229 --> 01:25:00.239 align:start position:0%
but there's 205 is the only thing that's
 
01:25:02.390 --> 01:25:02.400 align:start position:0%
going to guarantee that every new well
 
01:25:05.270 --> 01:25:05.280 align:start position:0%
is testing for arsenic among other
 
01:25:08.530 --> 01:25:08.540 align:start position:0%
things I also have arsenic
 
01:25:12.470 --> 01:25:12.480 align:start position:0%
in my well and I'm really grateful that
 
01:25:14.330 --> 01:25:14.340 align:start position:0%
it was tested for that
 
01:25:16.610 --> 01:25:16.620 align:start position:0%
but I'm lucky I live in Dover where they
 
01:25:19.430 --> 01:25:19.440 align:start position:0%
have higher standards so we're trying to
 
01:25:21.830 --> 01:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
pass something to make sure every new
 
01:25:25.189 --> 01:25:25.199 align:start position:0%
well is tested the notification in 398
 
01:25:27.770 --> 01:25:27.780 align:start position:0%
is not going to do that and I think we
 
01:25:30.590 --> 01:25:30.600 align:start position:0%
need to take action on it I don't find
 
01:25:33.350 --> 01:25:33.360 align:start position:0%
this bill overly complicated to
 
01:25:33.360 --> 01:25:35.750 align:start position:0%
this bill overly complicated to
understand

01:25:35.750 --> 01:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:35.760 --> 01:25:36.350 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:25:36.350 --> 01:25:36.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:42.110 --> 01:25:42.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:45.709 --> 01:25:45.719 align:start position:0%
kind of wrong thank you Mr chair
 
01:25:48.649 --> 01:25:48.659 align:start position:0%
it appears that and correct me if I'm
 
01:25:50.750 --> 01:25:50.760 align:start position:0%
wrong but that the opposition to the
 
01:25:52.850 --> 01:25:52.860 align:start position:0%
amendment was on the removal of the
 
01:25:55.490 --> 01:25:55.500 align:start position:0%
language of ours from about arsenic from
 
01:25:57.050 --> 01:25:57.060 align:start position:0%
the notification
 
01:25:59.810 --> 01:25:59.820 align:start position:0%
would you be willing Mr chair to
 
01:26:02.149 --> 01:26:02.159 align:start position:0%
consider recessing the executive session
 
01:26:04.669 --> 01:26:04.679 align:start position:0%
so that an amendment could be made we
 
01:26:06.709 --> 01:26:06.719 align:start position:0%
still have the optic pass motion open so
 
01:26:08.510 --> 01:26:08.520 align:start position:0%
if we can bring another amendment where
 
01:26:12.350 --> 01:26:12.360 align:start position:0%
we put that arsenic language back in if
 
01:26:14.209 --> 01:26:14.219 align:start position:0%
we don't have time to exec it now
 
01:26:16.129 --> 01:26:16.139 align:start position:0%
perhaps we can do it after the public
 
01:26:18.830 --> 01:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
hearing this afternoon
 
01:26:20.689 --> 01:26:20.699 align:start position:0%
but I think it is within your power that
 
01:26:22.490 --> 01:26:22.500 align:start position:0%
you can recess the executive session
 
01:26:25.129 --> 01:26:25.139 align:start position:0%
until amendment can because I I can I
 
01:26:27.550 --> 01:26:27.560 align:start position:0%
you know representative Darby we can
 
01:26:33.410 --> 01:26:33.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:36.410 --> 01:26:36.420 align:start position:0%
I appreciate your question but I'm not
 
01:26:39.530 --> 01:26:39.540 align:start position:0%
going to postpone this I think if you
 
01:26:41.870 --> 01:26:41.880 align:start position:0%
can work with representative McHugh
 
01:26:44.090 --> 01:26:44.100 align:start position:0%
before it hits the floor there's a lot
 
01:26:45.970 --> 01:26:45.980 align:start position:0%
of work that needs to be done on this
 
01:26:49.250 --> 01:26:49.260 align:start position:0%
and I thought that's why we were perhaps
 
01:26:50.990 --> 01:26:51.000 align:start position:0%
going to have a work session that was
 
01:26:54.110 --> 01:26:54.120 align:start position:0%
canceled then we tried to put forward by
 
01:26:56.030 --> 01:26:56.040 align:start position:0%
Miss by representative McHugh a
 
01:26:57.890 --> 01:26:57.900 align:start position:0%
retention so would have time to work on
 
01:27:00.770 --> 01:27:00.780 align:start position:0%
it and then all the people involved and
 
01:27:02.990 --> 01:27:03.000 align:start position:0%
other people could be brought back in so
 
01:27:05.629 --> 01:27:05.639 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to hold off a vote on this
 
01:27:07.070 --> 01:27:07.080 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry okay I'm going to call that's
 
01:27:07.080 --> 01:27:07.910 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry okay I'm going to call that's
okay

01:27:07.910 --> 01:27:07.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:27:09.470 --> 01:27:09.480 align:start position:0%
but you still have time as
 
01:27:11.689 --> 01:27:11.699 align:start position:0%
representative McHugh said to try to
 
01:27:13.430 --> 01:27:13.440 align:start position:0%
work something out before it hits the
 
01:27:15.050 --> 01:27:15.060 align:start position:0%
floor I'll take one more question
 
01:27:16.490 --> 01:27:16.500 align:start position:0%
because I don't think this is going
 
01:27:20.090 --> 01:27:20.100 align:start position:0%
anywhere representative Darby
 
01:27:22.310 --> 01:27:22.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I will be brief I
 
01:27:23.990 --> 01:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
know I've spoken a lot
 
01:27:26.990 --> 01:27:27.000 align:start position:0%
I just want to um
 
01:27:28.990 --> 01:27:29.000 align:start position:0%
stress a point that representative
 
01:27:31.490 --> 01:27:31.500 align:start position:0%
LaMontagne said which with respect to
 
01:27:34.189 --> 01:27:34.199 align:start position:0%
new wells oftentimes new wells are
 
01:27:35.870 --> 01:27:35.880 align:start position:0%
replacement Wells and they go into a
 
01:27:37.850 --> 01:27:37.860 align:start position:0%
different part of the aquifer and while
 
01:27:40.129 --> 01:27:40.139 align:start position:0%
you may have had your world tested when
 
01:27:42.290 --> 01:27:42.300 align:start position:0%
it was a dug well now that it's an
 
01:27:43.729 --> 01:27:43.739 align:start position:0%
Artesian well you have a completely
 
01:27:46.310 --> 01:27:46.320 align:start position:0%
different contaminants this um the
 
01:27:48.530 --> 01:27:48.540 align:start position:0%
testing portion would cover that well
 
01:27:50.450 --> 01:27:50.460 align:start position:0%
the other portion that I wanted to say
 
01:27:54.229 --> 01:27:54.239 align:start position:0%
is that the bones of this bill was based
 
01:27:56.030 --> 01:27:56.040 align:start position:0%
on the Seacoast Commission on long-term
 
01:27:57.410 --> 01:27:57.420 align:start position:0%
goals and requirements for drinking
 
01:27:59.770 --> 01:27:59.780 align:start position:0%
water which was a bipartisan commission
 
01:28:02.709 --> 01:28:02.719 align:start position:0%
with our own
 
01:28:05.390 --> 01:28:05.400 align:start position:0%
one of the members is on this committee
 
01:28:09.830 --> 01:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
from uh from Bedford and so I I think
 
01:28:12.410 --> 01:28:12.420 align:start position:0%
that there was bipartisan consensus and
 
01:28:16.850 --> 01:28:16.860 align:start position:0%
I would urge OTP on 205. thank you
 
01:28:18.470 --> 01:28:18.480 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm going to ask the question
 
01:28:20.330 --> 01:28:20.340 align:start position:0%
be called and let the clerk call the
 
01:28:23.510 --> 01:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
roll call it is with no motion with no
 
01:28:26.330 --> 01:28:26.340 align:start position:0%
amendments to pass ought to pass as
 
01:28:26.340 --> 01:28:27.890 align:start position:0%
amendments to pass ought to pass as
written

01:28:27.890 --> 01:28:27.900 align:start position:0%
written
 
01:28:31.250 --> 01:28:31.260 align:start position:0%
uh could you call the role Madam Clerk
 
01:28:37.490 --> 01:28:37.500 align:start position:0%
on Hillsville 205 uh representative C no
 
01:28:40.790 --> 01:28:40.800 align:start position:0%

01:28:57.110 --> 01:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
Vale yes
 
01:28:59.270 --> 01:28:59.280 align:start position:0%
representative wrong yes
 
01:29:00.890 --> 01:29:00.900 align:start position:0%
representative Kelly
 
01:29:00.900 --> 01:29:02.390 align:start position:0%
representative Kelly
yes

01:29:02.390 --> 01:29:02.400 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:29:04.669 --> 01:29:04.679 align:start position:0%
representative Simpson yes
 
01:29:06.350 --> 01:29:06.360 align:start position:0%
representative Baldwin yes
 
01:29:08.270 --> 01:29:08.280 align:start position:0%
representative Darby
 
01:29:11.570 --> 01:29:11.580 align:start position:0%
yes representative Hoyt yes
 
01:29:13.689 --> 01:29:13.699 align:start position:0%
representative LaMontagne yes
 
01:29:16.970 --> 01:29:16.980 align:start position:0%
representative Lovett yes representative
 
01:29:21.290 --> 01:29:21.300 align:start position:0%
Ryan yes and representative no
 
01:29:23.570 --> 01:29:23.580 align:start position:0%
it's 10 10.
 
01:29:26.149 --> 01:29:26.159 align:start position:0%
so we've gone through the gamut of all
 
01:29:28.790 --> 01:29:28.800 align:start position:0%
of the motions and they've all come out
 
01:29:31.490 --> 01:29:31.500 align:start position:0%
10 10 so my understanding it will go to
 
01:29:33.169 --> 01:29:33.179 align:start position:0%
the floor
 
01:29:36.709 --> 01:29:36.719 align:start position:0%
um with no recommendation I believe last
 
01:29:38.570 --> 01:29:38.580 align:start position:0%
representative McHugh who made the
 
01:29:42.470 --> 01:29:42.480 align:start position:0%
motion itl to write a memo on that and
 
01:29:44.570 --> 01:29:44.580 align:start position:0%
representative wrong you made the motion
 
01:29:46.550 --> 01:29:46.560 align:start position:0%
ought to pass so can you write the memo
 
01:29:48.890 --> 01:29:48.900 align:start position:0%
on that as I mentioned memos should be
 
01:29:50.870 --> 01:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
submitted to myself and the chair who
 
01:29:52.669 --> 01:29:52.679 align:start position:0%
regrettably couldn't be here today by
 
01:29:54.770 --> 01:29:54.780 align:start position:0%
noontime Friday
 
01:29:57.649 --> 01:29:57.659 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to take just about a one
 
01:29:59.450 --> 01:29:59.460 align:start position:0%
minute break
 
01:30:03.350 --> 01:30:03.360 align:start position:0%
um before we go into our last bill
 
01:30:03.360 --> 01:31:17.229 align:start position:0%
um before we go into our last bill
398.

01:31:17.229 --> 01:31:17.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:33.770 --> 01:32:33.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:50.330 --> 01:33:50.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:50.340 --> 01:34:52.910 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:34:52.910 --> 01:34:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:56.410 --> 01:34:56.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:02.750 --> 01:35:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:06.709 --> 01:35:06.719 align:start position:0%
so what do they have to do
 
01:35:06.719 --> 01:35:21.649 align:start position:0%
so what do they have to do
um

01:35:21.649 --> 01:35:21.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:21.659 --> 01:35:30.649 align:start position:0%
 
thinking

01:35:30.649 --> 01:35:30.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:30.659 --> 01:38:32.570 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:38:32.570 --> 01:38:32.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:34.790 --> 01:38:34.800 align:start position:0%
can I ask the members to take their
 
01:38:34.800 --> 01:39:05.450 align:start position:0%
can I ask the members to take their
seats

01:39:05.450 --> 01:39:05.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:08.030 --> 01:39:08.040 align:start position:0%
I think we're all back I call them
 
01:39:11.450 --> 01:39:11.460 align:start position:0%
meeting back to order thank you for your
 
01:39:16.669 --> 01:39:16.679 align:start position:0%
patience uh we're on House Bill 398.
 
01:39:19.250 --> 01:39:19.260 align:start position:0%
I understand representative wrong has a
 
01:39:21.830 --> 01:39:21.840 align:start position:0%
motion to make on 398. actually
 
01:39:23.870 --> 01:39:23.880 align:start position:0%
representative Darby does
 
01:39:25.790 --> 01:39:25.800 align:start position:0%
representative Darby I'd like to make a
 
01:39:28.610 --> 01:39:28.620 align:start position:0%
motion to retain House Bill 398. we have
 
01:39:29.990 --> 01:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
a motion to retain made by
 
01:39:31.970 --> 01:39:31.980 align:start position:0%
representative Darby to win a second
 
01:39:33.649 --> 01:39:33.659 align:start position:0%
I'll second it we have a second by
 
01:39:35.450 --> 01:39:35.460 align:start position:0%
representative rung would you wish to
 
01:39:38.330 --> 01:39:38.340 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion Mr Darby
 
01:39:40.910 --> 01:39:40.920 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chair
 
01:39:44.750 --> 01:39:44.760 align:start position:0%
um we we just heard that the language in
 
01:39:47.450 --> 01:39:47.460 align:start position:0%
um the notification language
 
01:39:47.460 --> 01:39:48.169 align:start position:0%
um the notification language
um

01:39:48.169 --> 01:39:48.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:50.930 --> 01:39:50.940 align:start position:0%
requires some rework in addition during
 
01:39:52.970 --> 01:39:52.980 align:start position:0%
the original testimony there was concern
 
01:39:54.830 --> 01:39:54.840 align:start position:0%
about the disclosure language that's in
 
01:39:57.290 --> 01:39:57.300 align:start position:0%
house bill 398. I think it's best to

introduce House Bill 448 relative to
 
02:22:50.210 --> 02:22:50.220 align:start position:0%
speed limit on Lake Winnipesaukee last
 
02:22:52.010 --> 02:22:52.020 align:start position:0%
year I came before the transportation
 
02:22:54.170 --> 02:22:54.180 align:start position:0%
committee to introduce a similar bill
 
02:22:56.570 --> 02:22:56.580 align:start position:0%
with the intent of removing the speed
 
02:22:59.750 --> 02:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
limit on the entire Lake
 
02:23:01.790 --> 02:23:01.800 align:start position:0%
um after conducting some research and
 
02:23:04.309 --> 02:23:04.319 align:start position:0%
speaking to several people it was
 
02:23:06.110 --> 02:23:06.120 align:start position:0%
determined that we come up with a
 
02:23:08.690 --> 02:23:08.700 align:start position:0%
compromise Bill uh in regards to the
 
02:23:11.510 --> 02:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
speed limit on Lake Winnipesaukee this
 
02:23:11.520 --> 02:23:12.650 align:start position:0%
speed limit on Lake Winnipesaukee this
bill

02:23:12.650 --> 02:23:12.660 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:23:15.230 --> 02:23:15.240 align:start position:0%
um which simply increased the speed
 
02:23:19.730 --> 02:23:19.740 align:start position:0%
limit from 45 miles an hour to 65 miles
 
02:23:22.429 --> 02:23:22.439 align:start position:0%
an hour in an area known as the broads
 
02:23:25.370 --> 02:23:25.380 align:start position:0%
the broads is the biggest wide open body
 
02:23:28.849 --> 02:23:28.859 align:start position:0%
of water on Lake Winnipesaukee
 
02:23:30.830 --> 02:23:30.840 align:start position:0%
um you're going to see hear some arguing
 
02:23:33.230 --> 02:23:33.240 align:start position:0%
that people you know a kayak there it's
 
02:23:35.690 --> 02:23:35.700 align:start position:0%
a safety issue
 
02:23:37.490 --> 02:23:37.500 align:start position:0%
um number one
 
02:23:39.410 --> 02:23:39.420 align:start position:0%
as far as kayaking in the broads go
 
02:23:41.030 --> 02:23:41.040 align:start position:0%
during the weekday in my personal
 
02:23:45.170 --> 02:23:45.180 align:start position:0%
opinion I believe it's fine safe okay
 
02:23:47.090 --> 02:23:47.100 align:start position:0%
join the weekends when that lake is
 
02:23:50.090 --> 02:23:50.100 align:start position:0%
twisting and turning and very rough I
 
02:23:51.710 --> 02:23:51.720 align:start position:0%
personally would be scared to get out
 
02:23:54.230 --> 02:23:54.240 align:start position:0%
there on a kayak or a canoe or
 
02:23:57.410 --> 02:23:57.420 align:start position:0%
any other vessel like that you're going
 
02:23:59.270 --> 02:23:59.280 align:start position:0%
through here an argument that about
 
02:23:59.280 --> 02:24:01.130 align:start position:0%
through here an argument that about
Shoreline

02:24:01.130 --> 02:24:01.140 align:start position:0%
Shoreline
 
02:24:04.010 --> 02:24:04.020 align:start position:0%
um erosion now a simple fact and I
 
02:24:05.330 --> 02:24:05.340 align:start position:0%
didn't bring it this time I had a 30
 
02:24:07.849 --> 02:24:07.859 align:start position:0%
page print out at the last hearing
 
02:24:10.610 --> 02:24:10.620 align:start position:0%
showing that the faster a vessel goes
 
02:24:14.450 --> 02:24:14.460 align:start position:0%
the less weight it throws now a wake
 
02:24:16.490 --> 02:24:16.500 align:start position:0%
boat will throw that's traveling at 15
 
02:24:19.190 --> 02:24:19.200 align:start position:0%
20 miles an hour is going to throw a big
 
02:24:20.809 --> 02:24:20.819 align:start position:0%
wide week
 
02:24:23.330 --> 02:24:23.340 align:start position:0%
with a high performance mode or some
 
02:24:24.770 --> 02:24:24.780 align:start position:0%
people like to call it a cigarette boat
 
02:24:27.230 --> 02:24:27.240 align:start position:0%
as soon as that boat gets up on plane
 
02:24:29.510 --> 02:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
the week dissipates and there's barely
 
02:24:31.969 --> 02:24:31.979 align:start position:0%
any weight behind the vessel this
 
02:24:33.469 --> 02:24:33.479 align:start position:0%
argument has been going on for years in
 
02:24:35.630 --> 02:24:35.640 align:start position:0%
regards to that and it is a scientific
 
02:24:38.990 --> 02:24:39.000 align:start position:0%
fact that the faster a motorboat goes
 
02:24:42.469 --> 02:24:42.479 align:start position:0%
the less wake it will throw
 
02:24:42.479 --> 02:24:43.309 align:start position:0%
the less wake it will throw
um

02:24:43.309 --> 02:24:43.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:24:45.710 --> 02:24:45.720 align:start position:0%
I mean this bill in my view I have
 
02:24:47.510 --> 02:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
people on my side of this bill that are
 
02:24:49.130 --> 02:24:49.140 align:start position:0%
angry with me and obviously the other
 
02:24:51.710 --> 02:24:51.720 align:start position:0%
side's angry I felt we should come up
 
02:24:53.389 --> 02:24:53.399 align:start position:0%
with a compromise that would benefit
 
02:24:53.399 --> 02:24:55.670 align:start position:0%
with a compromise that would benefit
everyone

02:24:55.670 --> 02:24:55.680 align:start position:0%
everyone
 
02:24:58.309 --> 02:24:58.319 align:start position:0%
um our biggest Revenue stream in The
 
02:24:59.809 --> 02:24:59.819 align:start position:0%
Lakes Region
 
02:25:02.330 --> 02:25:02.340 align:start position:0%
in my view is Lake Winnipesaukee and the
 
02:25:04.490 --> 02:25:04.500 align:start position:0%
Lakes Region as a whole I could go
 
02:25:07.550 --> 02:25:07.560 align:start position:0%
across to Lake winnerswam and I can race
 
02:25:10.309 --> 02:25:10.319 align:start position:0%
a boat around at 120 miles an hour no
 
02:25:12.349 --> 02:25:12.359 align:start position:0%
issues there's no speed limit
 
02:25:14.210 --> 02:25:14.220 align:start position:0%
there's no regulations but speed limit
 
02:25:16.190 --> 02:25:16.200 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire we have What's called
 
02:25:20.389 --> 02:25:20.399 align:start position:0%
the 150 foot rule what that means is any
 
02:25:23.990 --> 02:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
vessel needs to be 150 feet away from
 
02:25:25.969 --> 02:25:25.979 align:start position:0%
another vessel where one of the few
 
02:25:28.730 --> 02:25:28.740 align:start position:0%
states that does have this rule I feel
 
02:25:31.250 --> 02:25:31.260 align:start position:0%
we should be enforcing that role rather
 
02:25:34.010 --> 02:25:34.020 align:start position:0%
than a speed ordinance or a speed limit
 
02:25:35.349 --> 02:25:35.359 align:start position:0%
on the lake
 
02:25:38.929 --> 02:25:38.939 align:start position:0%
the area known as the broads is just
 
02:25:42.349 --> 02:25:42.359 align:start position:0%
wide open I'm literally on my boat every
 
02:25:44.450 --> 02:25:44.460 align:start position:0%
single day of the week in the summer I
 
02:25:46.429 --> 02:25:46.439 align:start position:0%
even go out in the rain sometimes
 
02:25:48.770 --> 02:25:48.780 align:start position:0%
and I could go from Meredith over the
 
02:25:51.230 --> 02:25:51.240 align:start position:0%
Wolfeboro and count on two hands the
 
02:25:53.389 --> 02:25:53.399 align:start position:0%
amount of vessels I see
 
02:25:55.849 --> 02:25:55.859 align:start position:0%
now the weekdays I mean the weekends I
 
02:25:57.290 --> 02:25:57.300 align:start position:0%
will say is a completely different
 
02:25:57.300 --> 02:25:58.429 align:start position:0%
will say is a completely different
argument

02:25:58.429 --> 02:25:58.439 align:start position:0%
argument
 
02:25:59.870 --> 02:25:59.880 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of people from out of
 
02:26:01.730 --> 02:26:01.740 align:start position:0%
state that come out uh boat
 
02:26:04.309 --> 02:26:04.319 align:start position:0%
registrations are up throughout the
 
02:26:06.290 --> 02:26:06.300 align:start position:0%
state but that does not mean people are
 
02:26:09.290 --> 02:26:09.300 align:start position:0%
using their vessels uh last year I saw a
 
02:26:11.990 --> 02:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
drastic decrease in the amount of boats
 
02:26:15.230 --> 02:26:15.240 align:start position:0%
on the water even on the weekend due to
 
02:26:17.809 --> 02:26:17.819 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:20.630 --> 02:26:20.640 align:start position:0%
um I mean it's just common sense we have
 
02:26:22.550 --> 02:26:22.560 align:start position:0%
much smaller bodies of water that do not
 
02:26:23.990 --> 02:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
have a speed limit
 
02:26:27.410 --> 02:26:27.420 align:start position:0%
and on our biggest open body of water in
 
02:26:29.690 --> 02:26:29.700 align:start position:0%
the state we are regulating and
 
02:26:32.389 --> 02:26:32.399 align:start position:0%
restricting certain vessels there's some
 
02:26:34.550 --> 02:26:34.560 align:start position:0%
people that even say they don't want any
 
02:26:37.130 --> 02:26:37.140 align:start position:0%
boats on Lake Winnipesaukee I have three
 
02:26:40.130 --> 02:26:40.140 align:start position:0%
people say that to me today
 
02:26:40.140 --> 02:26:40.790 align:start position:0%
people say that to me today
um

02:26:40.790 --> 02:26:40.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:26:43.190 --> 02:26:43.200 align:start position:0%
that's nonsense we need the revenue we
 
02:26:45.530 --> 02:26:45.540 align:start position:0%
need the tourism I used to be able to go
 
02:26:48.050 --> 02:26:48.060 align:start position:0%
to bars and restaurants and and places
 
02:26:50.570 --> 02:26:50.580 align:start position:0%
on the lake on a Wednesday and not be
 
02:26:52.910 --> 02:26:52.920 align:start position:0%
able to find the dock space ever since
 
02:26:55.130 --> 02:26:55.140 align:start position:0%
the speed limit was enacted I've seen
 
02:27:00.469 --> 02:27:00.479 align:start position:0%
weekday boat usage drastically decline
 
02:27:02.270 --> 02:27:02.280 align:start position:0%
um hotels that used to be fully booked
 
02:27:04.429 --> 02:27:04.439 align:start position:0%
are no longer fully booked during the
 
02:27:04.439 --> 02:27:05.809 align:start position:0%
are no longer fully booked during the
weekdays

02:27:05.809 --> 02:27:05.819 align:start position:0%
weekdays
 
02:27:08.270 --> 02:27:08.280 align:start position:0%
it's an economy issue as well it's in
 
02:27:11.210 --> 02:27:11.220 align:start position:0%
the Lakes Region and I really think we
 
02:27:14.210 --> 02:27:14.220 align:start position:0%
should have some common sense and allow
 
02:27:16.910 --> 02:27:16.920 align:start position:0%
quote unquote high performance vessels
 
02:27:19.849 --> 02:27:19.859 align:start position:0%
to participate on our Lake and have
 
02:27:22.910 --> 02:27:22.920 align:start position:0%
equal access to our Lake the other issue
 
02:27:25.429 --> 02:27:25.439 align:start position:0%
is in regards to equal access if you own
 
02:27:27.290 --> 02:27:27.300 align:start position:0%
a motor vessel you have to pay your
 
02:27:28.910 --> 02:27:28.920 align:start position:0%
registration fee
 
02:27:32.510 --> 02:27:32.520 align:start position:0%
those uses a kayaks canoes paddle boards
 
02:27:35.570 --> 02:27:35.580 align:start position:0%
do not pay a registration fee for access
 
02:27:38.330 --> 02:27:38.340 align:start position:0%
to the lake
 
02:27:40.730 --> 02:27:40.740 align:start position:0%
that's not equal access to me
 
02:27:43.610 --> 02:27:43.620 align:start position:0%
we also have
 
02:27:47.150 --> 02:27:47.160 align:start position:0%
in regards to 150 foot rule I constantly
 
02:27:49.790 --> 02:27:49.800 align:start position:0%
I I'm gonna bite my tongue off on this
 
02:27:52.190 --> 02:27:52.200 align:start position:0%
constantly see people breaking this role
 
02:27:54.889 --> 02:27:54.899 align:start position:0%
I think Marine Patrol should spend more
 
02:27:57.290 --> 02:27:57.300 align:start position:0%
time enforcing that role than the noise
 
02:28:01.210 --> 02:28:01.220 align:start position:0%
ordinance or the speed limit on the lake
 
02:28:04.250 --> 02:28:04.260 align:start position:0%
again I just look for you guys to make
 
02:28:06.889 --> 02:28:06.899 align:start position:0%
the right decision the Lakes Region
 
02:28:08.809 --> 02:28:08.819 align:start position:0%
economy is very important to me and many
 
02:28:11.990 --> 02:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
people and I don't think we should be
 
02:28:14.389 --> 02:28:14.399 align:start position:0%
chasing away people that would like to
 
02:28:17.210 --> 02:28:17.220 align:start position:0%
come to the area and spend their money I
 
02:28:19.250 --> 02:28:19.260 align:start position:0%
appreciate your time and thank you very
 
02:28:19.260 --> 02:28:19.910 align:start position:0%
appreciate your time and thank you very
much

02:28:19.910 --> 02:28:19.920 align:start position:0%
much
 
02:28:21.710 --> 02:28:21.720 align:start position:0%
representative will you accept questions
 
02:28:24.170 --> 02:28:24.180 align:start position:0%
yes I will does anyone have a question
 
02:28:26.510 --> 02:28:26.520 align:start position:0%
of the representative
 
02:28:29.330 --> 02:28:29.340 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
02:28:31.849 --> 02:28:31.859 align:start position:0%
um I'm a phys I was a physics teacher
 
02:28:34.849 --> 02:28:34.859 align:start position:0%
can you tell me which what where the
 
02:28:36.469 --> 02:28:36.479 align:start position:0%
rule is because I really would like to
 
02:28:38.690 --> 02:28:38.700 align:start position:0%
see it is it part of Bernard Louise
 
02:28:41.570 --> 02:28:41.580 align:start position:0%
principle I'm not really sure uh which
 
02:28:43.490 --> 02:28:43.500 align:start position:0%
rule are you the one on the faster goes
 
02:28:45.410 --> 02:28:45.420 align:start position:0%
unless you said the higher the boat the
 
02:28:48.410 --> 02:28:48.420 align:start position:0%
faster the boat goes the less the less I
 
02:28:50.090 --> 02:28:50.100 align:start position:0%
can email the committee on the actual
 
02:28:53.210 --> 02:28:53.220 align:start position:0%
information you did I can thank you very
 
02:28:55.070 --> 02:28:55.080 align:start position:0%
much because as a physics teacher I'm
 
02:28:56.750 --> 02:28:56.760 align:start position:0%
really interested yeah oh no it's it's
 
02:28:58.309 --> 02:28:58.319 align:start position:0%
yeah it's very detailed it's like 30
 
02:29:00.889 --> 02:29:00.899 align:start position:0%
pages long now just tell me which rule
 
02:29:02.270 --> 02:29:02.280 align:start position:0%
it is I'll look it up I'll have to look
 
02:29:04.309 --> 02:29:04.319 align:start position:0%

02:29:11.750 --> 02:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
it would help me members of the
 
02:29:13.550 --> 02:29:13.560 align:start position:0%
committee if you raise your hand if you
 
02:29:15.110 --> 02:29:15.120 align:start position:0%

is Robert Lemuel
 
02:29:27.950 --> 02:29:27.960 align:start position:0%
if I said it right
 
02:29:32.150 --> 02:29:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:34.309 --> 02:29:34.319 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and a good
 
02:29:36.650 --> 02:29:36.660 align:start position:0%
afternoon everyone colleagues my name is
 
02:29:38.990 --> 02:29:39.000 align:start position:0%
John McDonald and I represent the folks
 
02:29:41.330 --> 02:29:41.340 align:start position:0%
of the town of wolfbone the community of
 
02:29:44.630 --> 02:29:44.640 align:start position:0%
Tuftonboro and we have about probably 8
 
02:29:46.790 --> 02:29:46.800 align:start position:0%
000 people year round in those two
 
02:29:48.410 --> 02:29:48.420 align:start position:0%
communities and we probably grew up to
 
02:29:50.870 --> 02:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
about 40 000 during the summer months
 
02:29:54.110 --> 02:29:54.120 align:start position:0%
I'm a lifelong resident of Wolfgang and
 
02:29:56.090 --> 02:29:56.100 align:start position:0%
I'd say I probably got several thousand
 
02:29:57.830 --> 02:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
hours of voting experience on liquid
 
02:30:00.530 --> 02:30:00.540 align:start position:0%
besaki I retired from a 30-year career
 
02:30:02.510 --> 02:30:02.520 align:start position:0%
on law enforcement and during my career
 
02:30:04.670 --> 02:30:04.680 align:start position:0%
I worked for the New Hampshire Marine
 
02:30:04.680 --> 02:30:05.510 align:start position:0%
I worked for the New Hampshire Marine
Patrol

02:30:05.510 --> 02:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
Patrol
 
02:30:07.190 --> 02:30:07.200 align:start position:0%
and now we're supporting education
 
02:30:09.170 --> 02:30:09.180 align:start position:0%
officer full-time for the entire State
 
02:30:11.690 --> 02:30:11.700 align:start position:0%
and it probably spoke to uh several
 
02:30:13.250 --> 02:30:13.260 align:start position:0%
thousand people about voting safety
 
02:30:16.330 --> 02:30:16.340 align:start position:0%
issues and providing boating education
 
02:30:19.550 --> 02:30:19.560 align:start position:0%
I'm also a graduate of the national uh
 
02:30:21.889 --> 02:30:21.899 align:start position:0%
Coast Guard safe boating school and I'm
 
02:30:23.990 --> 02:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
also a licensed commercial boat operator
 
02:30:28.130 --> 02:30:28.140 align:start position:0%
up to 70 feet and 700 horsepower
 
02:30:30.290 --> 02:30:30.300 align:start position:0%
for the past several years I've been a
 
02:30:32.330 --> 02:30:32.340 align:start position:0%
captain on the Winnipesaukee ball which
 
02:30:34.309 --> 02:30:34.319 align:start position:0%
does daily cruises on the quinnipesaukee
 
02:30:37.969 --> 02:30:37.979 align:start position:0%
and also Charters during the evening
 
02:30:40.130 --> 02:30:40.140 align:start position:0%
I appreciate my colleague and my friends
 
02:30:42.770 --> 02:30:42.780 align:start position:0%
comments uh concerning the uh the
 
02:30:44.870 --> 02:30:44.880 align:start position:0%
economy I'm not seeing that in my
 
02:30:47.809 --> 02:30:47.819 align:start position:0%
community uh we're busy a lot of boats a
 
02:30:50.389 --> 02:30:50.399 align:start position:0%
lot of people uh motels and hotels are
 
02:30:53.929 --> 02:30:53.939 align:start position:0%
sold out uh we just spent about 650 000
 
02:30:57.170 --> 02:30:57.180 align:start position:0%
on the docks in town to remodel those
 
02:30:59.230 --> 02:30:59.240 align:start position:0%
and we also provide
 
02:31:01.849 --> 02:31:01.859 align:start position:0%
assistance in docking boats so we're
 
02:31:03.110 --> 02:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
spending a lot of money to keep
 
02:31:04.550 --> 02:31:04.560 align:start position:0%
everything going
 
02:31:04.560 --> 02:31:06.050 align:start position:0%
everything going
uh

02:31:06.050 --> 02:31:06.060 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:31:08.270 --> 02:31:08.280 align:start position:0%
over the years I've seen a lot of
 
02:31:11.809 --> 02:31:11.819 align:start position:0%
changes and the past 10 years since it's
 
02:31:13.790 --> 02:31:13.800 align:start position:0%
last been in effect
 
02:31:15.590 --> 02:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
I don't know what what he's trying to
 
02:31:17.389 --> 02:31:17.399 align:start position:0%
change the only thing that's increased
 
02:31:19.190 --> 02:31:19.200 align:start position:0%
the league the lake isn't any any bigger
 
02:31:20.990 --> 02:31:21.000 align:start position:0%
and it's not any smaller it's about the
 
02:31:22.130 --> 02:31:22.140 align:start position:0%
same size
 
02:31:24.290 --> 02:31:24.300 align:start position:0%
the same considerations that the members
 
02:31:26.870 --> 02:31:26.880 align:start position:0%
back in I guess it was 2010 when they
 
02:31:29.570 --> 02:31:29.580 align:start position:0%
passed this fee limit still exist we
 
02:31:31.610 --> 02:31:31.620 align:start position:0%
still have a lot of boats we have more
 
02:31:32.870 --> 02:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
people that aren't just doing water
 
02:31:35.510 --> 02:31:35.520 align:start position:0%
skiing and driving around but the using
 
02:31:38.450 --> 02:31:38.460 align:start position:0%
as it as a mode of transportation either
 
02:31:40.130 --> 02:31:40.140 align:start position:0%
going from an Ireland property to shore
 
02:31:43.190 --> 02:31:43.200 align:start position:0%
to your groceries or to a restaurant to
 
02:31:46.070 --> 02:31:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:47.809 --> 02:31:47.819 align:start position:0%
the big thing about boats and it asks
 
02:31:50.630 --> 02:31:50.640 align:start position:0%
you folks to consider this is uh
 
02:31:54.170 --> 02:31:54.180 align:start position:0%
we would strip speed on snowmobiles oh
 
02:31:57.590 --> 02:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
hivs and what do boats not have that
 
02:31:59.630 --> 02:31:59.640 align:start position:0%
those type of vehicles have
 
02:32:01.910 --> 02:32:01.920 align:start position:0%
brakes a boat doesn't have any brakes
 
02:32:04.370 --> 02:32:04.380 align:start position:0%
all you can do is put it in neutral and
 
02:32:10.969 --> 02:32:10.979 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:12.830 --> 02:32:12.840 align:start position:0%
again we still have safety concerns just
 
02:32:14.230 --> 02:32:14.240 align:start position:0%
10 years ago
 
02:32:16.969 --> 02:32:16.979 align:start position:0%
I like to think we hear a lot about
 
02:32:18.710 --> 02:32:18.720 align:start position:0%
cigarette boats and all the money that
 
02:32:21.889 --> 02:32:21.899 align:start position:0%
people have spent on cigarette boats I
 
02:32:24.290 --> 02:32:24.300 align:start position:0%
look at as if I go buy a Corvette and a
 
02:32:27.170 --> 02:32:27.180 align:start position:0%
Porsche that can do 200 miles an hour I
 
02:32:29.990 --> 02:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
still have to go 60 or 65 miles per hour
 
02:32:31.969 --> 02:32:31.979 align:start position:0%
on the interstate a boat shouldn't be
 
02:32:33.110 --> 02:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
any different
 
02:32:34.969 --> 02:32:34.979 align:start position:0%
if you want to go out do 100 miles an
 
02:32:36.950 --> 02:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
hour 70 miles an hour they can slide
 
02:32:38.510 --> 02:32:38.520 align:start position:0%
down and go on the ocean where they will
 
02:32:40.790 --> 02:32:40.800 align:start position:0%
support that all right I'd ask you folks
 
02:32:42.170 --> 02:32:42.180 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
02:32:45.110 --> 02:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
not pass this bill I.T outlet and let
 
02:32:47.570 --> 02:32:47.580 align:start position:0%
the state consider consider uh the
 
02:32:49.130 --> 02:32:49.140 align:start position:0%
reference in promoting boating safety to
 
02:32:50.450 --> 02:32:50.460 align:start position:0%
keep the legs
 
02:32:53.030 --> 02:32:53.040 align:start position:0%
especially liquid masaki uh safe for
 
02:32:55.190 --> 02:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
everyone not just as high speed boats
 
02:32:56.630 --> 02:32:56.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:32:58.849 --> 02:32:58.859 align:start position:0%
if you take questions representative yes
 
02:33:00.590 --> 02:33:00.600 align:start position:0%
does anyone have a question of the
 
02:33:00.600 --> 02:33:03.050 align:start position:0%
does anyone have a question of the
representative

02:33:03.050 --> 02:33:03.060 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:33:05.030 --> 02:33:05.040 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you thank you Mr
 
02:33:08.450 --> 02:33:08.460 align:start position:0%
chairman next up Mr lamoreau who's in
 
02:33:10.130 --> 02:33:10.140 align:start position:0%
support of the bill and on Deck
 
02:33:12.050 --> 02:33:12.060 align:start position:0%
Lieutenant Dennis Wade of the Department
 
02:33:13.490 --> 02:33:13.500 align:start position:0%
of Safety
 
02:33:16.130 --> 02:33:16.140 align:start position:0%
Mr lamoreau
 
02:33:17.690 --> 02:33:17.700 align:start position:0%
I have to press that
 
02:33:19.969 --> 02:33:19.979 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for hearing me
 
02:33:22.190 --> 02:33:22.200 align:start position:0%
um I do have some documents that I don't
 
02:33:22.200 --> 02:33:22.910 align:start position:0%
um I do have some documents that I don't
know

02:33:22.910 --> 02:33:22.920 align:start position:0%
know
 
02:33:25.010 --> 02:33:25.020 align:start position:0%
how to get them to somebody or is
 
02:33:27.469 --> 02:33:27.479 align:start position:0%
somebody going to get them from me
 
02:33:29.330 --> 02:33:29.340 align:start position:0%
um I appreciate you listening for a
 
02:33:31.130 --> 02:33:31.140 align:start position:0%
minute I basically wanted to get into
 
02:33:34.730 --> 02:33:34.740 align:start position:0%
talking about hydrodynamics and
 
02:33:37.429 --> 02:33:37.439 align:start position:0%
aerodynamics of boats that it seems like
 
02:33:40.750 --> 02:33:40.760 align:start position:0%
nobody pays attention to
 
02:33:43.010 --> 02:33:43.020 align:start position:0%
aerodynamics and hydrodynamics are
 
02:33:44.929 --> 02:33:44.939 align:start position:0%
heavily involved with the way boats run
 
02:33:47.450 --> 02:33:47.460 align:start position:0%
when you put a 45 mile an hour speed
 
02:33:52.190 --> 02:33:52.200 align:start position:0%
limit on the lake that 45 is pretty slow
 
02:33:54.290 --> 02:33:54.300 align:start position:0%
to pack enough air underneath those
 
02:33:57.010 --> 02:33:57.020 align:start position:0%
boats to get the boats to ride properly
 
02:33:59.570 --> 02:33:59.580 align:start position:0%
all the new technology coming out in
 
02:34:03.110 --> 02:34:03.120 align:start position:0%
these new boats is going to have Aero
 
02:34:05.090 --> 02:34:05.100 align:start position:0%
and hydrodynamics involved in them look
 
02:34:06.830 --> 02:34:06.840 align:start position:0%
at the hulls when you look at the hulls
 
02:34:08.690 --> 02:34:08.700 align:start position:0%
they have
 
02:34:12.410 --> 02:34:12.420 align:start position:0%
uh you know different steps in them well
 
02:34:14.270 --> 02:34:14.280 align:start position:0%
those are all about the air and the
 
02:34:17.090 --> 02:34:17.100 align:start position:0%
Hydraulics and and exactly what what
 
02:34:19.670 --> 02:34:19.680 align:start position:0%
this gentleman had said about the waves
 
02:34:23.150 --> 02:34:23.160 align:start position:0%
he he's correct you know the waves isn't
 
02:34:26.210 --> 02:34:26.220 align:start position:0%
the problem it's the ice I'm on the lake
 
02:34:28.969 --> 02:34:28.979 align:start position:0%
destroys my front yard every time pushes
 
02:34:31.550 --> 02:34:31.560 align:start position:0%
all the Rocks pushes all the boldest
 
02:34:34.670 --> 02:34:34.680 align:start position:0%
I haven't seen any boat waves ever make
 
02:34:37.010 --> 02:34:37.020 align:start position:0%
any difference on the shore but I
 
02:34:38.690 --> 02:34:38.700 align:start position:0%
certainly see the ice
 
02:34:41.630 --> 02:34:41.640 align:start position:0%
so someone wants to tell you that
 
02:34:43.550 --> 02:34:43.560 align:start position:0%
go take a look at what the ice did come
 
02:34:45.590 --> 02:34:45.600 align:start position:0%
to my yard
 
02:34:48.830 --> 02:34:48.840 align:start position:0%
um as far as
 
02:34:51.290 --> 02:34:51.300 align:start position:0%
you know the the personal effect that
 
02:34:53.809 --> 02:34:53.819 align:start position:0%
was on me is you know I get a I get a
 
02:34:56.630 --> 02:34:56.640 align:start position:0%
fish boat my fish boat is a tunnel boat
 
02:34:58.429 --> 02:34:58.439 align:start position:0%
that tunnel boat doesn't even begin to
 
02:35:02.150 --> 02:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
work at 45. so he wanted me to go 45 but
 
02:35:03.710 --> 02:35:03.720 align:start position:0%
I can't get the boat up out of the water
 
02:35:05.870 --> 02:35:05.880 align:start position:0%
enough to get up to clear the way so I
 
02:35:07.370 --> 02:35:07.380 align:start position:0%
just beat the crap out of myself driving
 
02:35:08.750 --> 02:35:08.760 align:start position:0%
around the lake
 
02:35:12.770 --> 02:35:12.780 align:start position:0%
I mean it it's pretty unfair
 
02:35:14.990 --> 02:35:15.000 align:start position:0%
um the other thing is that you know
 
02:35:16.429 --> 02:35:16.439 align:start position:0%
we're going to lose out on a lot of
 
02:35:18.349 --> 02:35:18.359 align:start position:0%
technology in these boats these boats
 
02:35:22.210 --> 02:35:22.220 align:start position:0%
are going to have more more air and more
 
02:35:24.410 --> 02:35:24.420 align:start position:0%
aerodynamics and hydrodynamics built
 
02:35:26.750 --> 02:35:26.760 align:start position:0%
into them and we're going to miss out on
 
02:35:28.730 --> 02:35:28.740 align:start position:0%
those boats beautiful technology boats
 
02:35:29.690 --> 02:35:29.700 align:start position:0%
that we're not going to be able to get
 
02:35:32.030 --> 02:35:32.040 align:start position:0%
on the lake because your speed limit's
 
02:35:33.770 --> 02:35:33.780 align:start position:0%
too slow
 
02:35:35.990 --> 02:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
now you know I've raised tighter planes
 
02:35:37.550 --> 02:35:37.560 align:start position:0%
all my life and you go around in these
 
02:35:40.370 --> 02:35:40.380 align:start position:0%
other states and countries and they
 
02:35:42.230 --> 02:35:42.240 align:start position:0%
laugh at us because we got a speed limit
 
02:35:44.450 --> 02:35:44.460 align:start position:0%
on one of masaki they laugh at us it's
 
02:35:46.010 --> 02:35:46.020 align:start position:0%
kind of embarrassing
 
02:35:47.870 --> 02:35:47.880 align:start position:0%
but anyway now
 
02:35:50.570 --> 02:35:50.580 align:start position:0%
um the other thing that I wanted to
 
02:35:54.830 --> 02:35:54.840 align:start position:0%
mention to change subjects is um
 
02:35:56.750 --> 02:35:56.760 align:start position:0%
you know the law the law should be for
 
02:35:58.670 --> 02:35:58.680 align:start position:0%
the majority not cater to a small
 
02:36:01.490 --> 02:36:01.500 align:start position:0%
minority who really have no knowledge of
 
02:36:03.469 --> 02:36:03.479 align:start position:0%
the effect on everyone
 
02:36:04.969 --> 02:36:04.979 align:start position:0%
I mean they think they have the
 
02:36:07.309 --> 02:36:07.319 align:start position:0%
knowledge of the effect on everybody but
 
02:36:09.469 --> 02:36:09.479 align:start position:0%
they don't I don't I don't know how they
 
02:36:11.630 --> 02:36:11.640 align:start position:0%
get away with it and then they they sit
 
02:36:12.950 --> 02:36:12.960 align:start position:0%
in front of their computer and they use
 
02:36:15.830 --> 02:36:15.840 align:start position:0%
their computer and make themselves look
 
02:36:17.990 --> 02:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
almighty God powerful
 
02:36:20.330 --> 02:36:20.340 align:start position:0%
and feel you full of crap and I don't
 
02:36:22.429 --> 02:36:22.439 align:start position:0%
think that's right I think it's totally
 
02:36:22.439 --> 02:36:23.270 align:start position:0%
think that's right I think it's totally
wrong

02:36:23.270 --> 02:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
02:36:26.690 --> 02:36:26.700 align:start position:0%
for for us to listen to a small little
 
02:36:26.700 --> 02:36:27.950 align:start position:0%
for for us to listen to a small little
group

02:36:27.950 --> 02:36:27.960 align:start position:0%
group
 
02:36:30.110 --> 02:36:30.120 align:start position:0%
you know you need to listen to the big
 
02:36:32.510 --> 02:36:32.520 align:start position:0%
group the big taxpayer
 
02:36:35.570 --> 02:36:35.580 align:start position:0%
if you put this on a ballot it'll
 
02:36:37.370 --> 02:36:37.380 align:start position:0%
probably get wiped out and end up with
 
02:36:40.070 --> 02:36:40.080 align:start position:0%
no speed limit because there's more
 
02:36:41.990 --> 02:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
people that are probably in favor of no
 
02:36:45.230 --> 02:36:45.240 align:start position:0%
speed limit and no speed limit now I'm
 
02:36:48.050 --> 02:36:48.060 align:start position:0%
approaching my two minutes I'm sure uh
 
02:36:50.510 --> 02:36:50.520 align:start position:0%
the last thing that that I want to make
 
02:36:52.370 --> 02:36:52.380 align:start position:0%
mention is you know the lake is very
 
02:36:56.090 --> 02:36:56.100 align:start position:0%
dangerous and very unforgiving I mean
 
02:36:58.969 --> 02:36:58.979 align:start position:0%
you can die easily in that Lake all
 
02:37:01.610 --> 02:37:01.620 align:start position:0%
right and I've done many many many small
 
02:37:04.070 --> 02:37:04.080 align:start position:0%
boat canoe and kayak paddle rescues
 
02:37:07.210 --> 02:37:07.220 align:start position:0%
trips out there you know getting people
 
02:37:10.270 --> 02:37:10.280 align:start position:0%
with these small little boats
 
02:37:13.490 --> 02:37:13.500 align:start position:0%
they they always seem to be in trouble
 
02:37:16.490 --> 02:37:16.500 align:start position:0%
and there's a lot of deaths there but
 
02:37:19.250 --> 02:37:19.260 align:start position:0%
you know we're not stopping them
 
02:37:21.170 --> 02:37:21.180 align:start position:0%
and there's a lot of deaths in these
 
02:37:23.330 --> 02:37:23.340 align:start position:0%
small little boats and if you could
 
02:37:25.070 --> 02:37:25.080 align:start position:0%
bring it to a conclusion we don't and we
 
02:37:27.290 --> 02:37:27.300 align:start position:0%
don't stop them I I just doesn't make
 
02:37:29.030 --> 02:37:29.040 align:start position:0%
any sense to me so I hope that everybody
 
02:37:31.610 --> 02:37:31.620 align:start position:0%
here has common sense for all and not
 
02:37:33.830 --> 02:37:33.840 align:start position:0%
for a small minority
 
02:37:36.050 --> 02:37:36.060 align:start position:0%
all right thank you for listening to me
 
02:37:38.330 --> 02:37:38.340 align:start position:0%
I appreciate it do you take questions
 
02:37:41.870 --> 02:37:41.880 align:start position:0%
yes anyone have a question for the
 
02:37:44.030 --> 02:37:44.040 align:start position:0%
Mr lamaro
 
02:37:46.610 --> 02:37:46.620 align:start position:0%
go ahead in the front
 
02:37:49.010 --> 02:37:49.020 align:start position:0%
representative I can't the way you're
 
02:37:50.330 --> 02:37:50.340 align:start position:0%
raising your hand
 
02:37:52.730 --> 02:37:52.740 align:start position:0%
I guess not all right I guess no
 
02:37:54.590 --> 02:37:54.600 align:start position:0%
questions I don't see any hands way up
 
02:37:56.270 --> 02:37:56.280 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
02:37:59.270 --> 02:37:59.280 align:start position:0%
thank you very much before Lieutenant
 
02:38:02.570 --> 02:38:02.580 align:start position:0%
Wade speaks uh on Deck Harry Vogel Harry
 
02:38:07.190 --> 02:38:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:11.270 --> 02:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman uh members committee um good
 
02:38:12.969 --> 02:38:12.979 align:start position:0%
afternoon I'm Lieutenant Dennis Wade
 
02:38:14.750 --> 02:38:14.760 align:start position:0%
Commander New Hampshire State Police
 
02:38:16.070 --> 02:38:16.080 align:start position:0%
Marine Patrol
 
02:38:17.750 --> 02:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
I'm here representing the department of
 
02:38:20.330 --> 02:38:20.340 align:start position:0%
safety the division of State Police and
 
02:38:23.990 --> 02:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
to testify against uh house bill 448.
 
02:38:26.090 --> 02:38:26.100 align:start position:0%
Lake Winnipesaukee is one of 30 lakes in
 
02:38:27.530 --> 02:38:27.540 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire where there is a per se
 
02:38:29.030 --> 02:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
speed law
 
02:38:31.250 --> 02:38:31.260 align:start position:0%
the speed limit on most of these other
 
02:38:33.469 --> 02:38:33.479 align:start position:0%
30 Lakes is 10 miles an hour with just a
 
02:38:34.969 --> 02:38:34.979 align:start position:0%
few being above that
 
02:38:36.950 --> 02:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
Winnipesaukee currently has a speed
 
02:38:38.750 --> 02:38:38.760 align:start position:0%
limit of 45 miles an hour from one half
 
02:38:40.550 --> 02:38:40.560 align:start position:0%
hour before Sunrise to one half hour
 
02:38:43.490 --> 02:38:43.500 align:start position:0%
after Sunset basically daytime
 
02:38:46.309 --> 02:38:46.319 align:start position:0%
and 30 miles an hour at night time these
 
02:38:48.230 --> 02:38:48.240 align:start position:0%
speed limits are not absolute they are
 
02:38:49.730 --> 02:38:49.740 align:start position:0%
allowed only where no other Hazard
 
02:38:52.429 --> 02:38:52.439 align:start position:0%
exists where a lower speed is uh
 
02:38:52.439 --> 02:38:53.870 align:start position:0%
exists where a lower speed is uh
required

02:38:53.870 --> 02:38:53.880 align:start position:0%
required
 
02:38:55.790 --> 02:38:55.800 align:start position:0%
these hazards include were not limited
 
02:38:58.910 --> 02:38:58.920 align:start position:0%
to boat traffic weather waves sunglare
 
02:38:58.920 --> 02:39:00.170 align:start position:0%
to boat traffic weather waves sunglare
swimmers

02:39:00.170 --> 02:39:00.180 align:start position:0%
swimmers
 
02:39:02.389 --> 02:39:02.399 align:start position:0%
and water debris
 
02:39:05.030 --> 02:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
driving a boat at 65 miles an hour can
 
02:39:07.429 --> 02:39:07.439 align:start position:0%
be dangerous a boat moving at 45 miles
 
02:39:09.590 --> 02:39:09.600 align:start position:0%
an hour is traveling at 66 feet per
 
02:39:11.870 --> 02:39:11.880 align:start position:0%
second where a boat traveling is 65
 
02:39:14.030 --> 02:39:14.040 align:start position:0%
miles an hour it's traveling at 95 feet
 
02:39:17.450 --> 02:39:17.460 align:start position:0%
per second almost 30 feet difference
 
02:39:19.070 --> 02:39:19.080 align:start position:0%
that 30 feet can determine the time
 
02:39:21.410 --> 02:39:21.420 align:start position:0%
needed for a driver to avoid a crash
 
02:39:23.630 --> 02:39:23.640 align:start position:0%
the average perception reaction time for
 
02:39:26.929 --> 02:39:26.939 align:start position:0%
a person is approximately 1.5 seconds
 
02:39:29.330 --> 02:39:29.340 align:start position:0%
this is perception reaction time for a
 
02:39:31.610 --> 02:39:31.620 align:start position:0%
driver who is actively paying attention
 
02:39:34.070 --> 02:39:34.080 align:start position:0%
in that 1.5 seconds a boat traveling at
 
02:39:36.770 --> 02:39:36.780 align:start position:0%
45 miles an hour will travel at 99 uh
 
02:39:38.630 --> 02:39:38.640 align:start position:0%
we'll travel 99 feet
 
02:39:40.969 --> 02:39:40.979 align:start position:0%
65 miles an hour that boat will travel
 
02:39:42.830 --> 02:39:42.840 align:start position:0%
142 feet
 
02:39:45.110 --> 02:39:45.120 align:start position:0%
again this is reaction time then the
 
02:39:46.730 --> 02:39:46.740 align:start position:0%
driver's actions has to have to take
 
02:39:48.950 --> 02:39:48.960 align:start position:0%
place to actually avoid whatever Hazard
 
02:39:48.960 --> 02:39:49.969 align:start position:0%
place to actually avoid whatever Hazard
exists

02:39:49.969 --> 02:39:49.979 align:start position:0%
exists
 
02:39:52.070 --> 02:39:52.080 align:start position:0%
unlike Motor Vehicles boats do not have
 
02:39:54.230 --> 02:39:54.240 align:start position:0%
brakes requiring additional stopping
 
02:39:56.389 --> 02:39:56.399 align:start position:0%
time and distance on the water
 
02:39:58.250 --> 02:39:58.260 align:start position:0%
an operator can only throttle back and
 
02:39:59.690 --> 02:39:59.700 align:start position:0%
maybe even put the boat into into
 
02:40:02.030 --> 02:40:02.040 align:start position:0%
reverse still this will not stop a boat
 
02:40:04.130 --> 02:40:04.140 align:start position:0%
quickly and the steerage of a boat does
 
02:40:05.450 --> 02:40:05.460 align:start position:0%
not operate the same when it's in
 
02:40:05.460 --> 02:40:06.770 align:start position:0%
not operate the same when it's in
neutral

02:40:06.770 --> 02:40:06.780 align:start position:0%
neutral
 
02:40:08.510 --> 02:40:08.520 align:start position:0%
Lake Winnipesaukee is used for many
 
02:40:10.730 --> 02:40:10.740 align:start position:0%
different recreational activities
 
02:40:13.190 --> 02:40:13.200 align:start position:0%
water skiing swimming canoeing kayaking
 
02:40:13.200 --> 02:40:14.530 align:start position:0%
water skiing swimming canoeing kayaking
fishing

02:40:14.530 --> 02:40:14.540 align:start position:0%
fishing
 
02:40:18.469 --> 02:40:18.479 align:start position:0%
sailing motorboating and many more
 
02:40:20.210 --> 02:40:20.220 align:start position:0%
there needs to be a balance by the use
 
02:40:22.250 --> 02:40:22.260 align:start position:0%
of all these recreationalists to include
 
02:40:22.260 --> 02:40:23.450 align:start position:0%
of all these recreationalists to include
motorboats

02:40:23.450 --> 02:40:23.460 align:start position:0%
motorboats
 
02:40:25.790 --> 02:40:25.800 align:start position:0%
although there's an area defined in this
 
02:40:27.410 --> 02:40:27.420 align:start position:0%
law where the 65 mile an hour speed
 
02:40:29.270 --> 02:40:29.280 align:start position:0%
limit would be allowed that would be
 
02:40:31.550 --> 02:40:31.560 align:start position:0%
hard to distinguish there are no defined
 
02:40:33.110 --> 02:40:33.120 align:start position:0%
edges in the water like you have on the
 
02:40:34.910 --> 02:40:34.920 align:start position:0%
roads there's no sidewalks there's no
 
02:40:37.190 --> 02:40:37.200 align:start position:0%
yellow and white lines no travel lanes
 
02:40:40.190 --> 02:40:40.200 align:start position:0%
and no no traffic control devices
 
02:40:41.809 --> 02:40:41.819 align:start position:0%
add in that not everyone on the lake
 
02:40:43.610 --> 02:40:43.620 align:start position:0%
knows the lake has been there before
 
02:40:45.170 --> 02:40:45.180 align:start position:0%
will not be familiar with the boundaries
 
02:40:47.450 --> 02:40:47.460 align:start position:0%
discerned by this law this can make for
 
02:40:49.670 --> 02:40:49.680 align:start position:0%
a very dangerous mix
 
02:40:51.349 --> 02:40:51.359 align:start position:0%
having the area defined throughout
 
02:40:52.670 --> 02:40:52.680 align:start position:0%
through written law
 
02:40:54.290 --> 02:40:54.300 align:start position:0%
would not be the same as having a
 
02:40:56.090 --> 02:40:56.100 align:start position:0%
clearly defined area that a voter can
 
02:40:56.100 --> 02:40:57.050 align:start position:0%
clearly defined area that a voter can
understand

02:40:57.050 --> 02:40:57.060 align:start position:0%
understand
 
02:40:59.210 --> 02:40:59.220 align:start position:0%
when driving a road the road is defined
 
02:41:00.889 --> 02:41:00.899 align:start position:0%
you know when you're turning onto or off
 
02:41:02.630 --> 02:41:02.640 align:start position:0%
of a road you have curbs and
 
02:41:04.130 --> 02:41:04.140 align:start position:0%
intersections you also have speed limit
 
02:41:06.590 --> 02:41:06.600 align:start position:0%
signs traffic control devices caution
 
02:41:08.929 --> 02:41:08.939 align:start position:0%
signs yield signs this will not be the
 
02:41:10.610 --> 02:41:10.620 align:start position:0%
case in Lake Winnipesaukee should this
 
02:41:13.190 --> 02:41:13.200 align:start position:0%
law pass
 
02:41:14.870 --> 02:41:14.880 align:start position:0%
how will the motor know when they're in
 
02:41:17.389 --> 02:41:17.399 align:start position:0%
the 65 mile an hour Zone not necessarily
 
02:41:19.610 --> 02:41:19.620 align:start position:0%
because they plan on going fast but so
 
02:41:20.809 --> 02:41:20.819 align:start position:0%
they can be more cautious of other
 
02:41:22.670 --> 02:41:22.680 align:start position:0%
voters that might
 
02:41:24.530 --> 02:41:24.540 align:start position:0%
there were kids in other novice boaters
 
02:41:26.330 --> 02:41:26.340 align:start position:0%
who vote on this Lake are they going to
 
02:41:27.770 --> 02:41:27.780 align:start position:0%
know where where they are and what
 
02:41:30.050 --> 02:41:30.060 align:start position:0%
hazards to look for in order to sign
 
02:41:32.690 --> 02:41:32.700 align:start position:0%
this to sign this area so all users knew
 
02:41:35.510 --> 02:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
that this was a 65 mile per hour Zone it
 
02:41:37.250 --> 02:41:37.260 align:start position:0%
would take an unknown number of buoys to
 
02:41:39.349 --> 02:41:39.359 align:start position:0%
be placed at an unknown cost
 
02:41:41.450 --> 02:41:41.460 align:start position:0%
buoys and unexpected places that can
 
02:41:43.910 --> 02:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
also pose a hazard
 
02:41:45.290 --> 02:41:45.300 align:start position:0%
we do not want to create additional
 
02:41:47.030 --> 02:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
hazards especially in an area does not
 
02:41:48.889 --> 02:41:48.899 align:start position:0%
necessarily have environmental
 
02:41:51.530 --> 02:41:51.540 align:start position:0%
obstructions this would also take away
 
02:41:53.870 --> 02:41:53.880 align:start position:0%
from the beauty of the lake
 
02:41:55.849 --> 02:41:55.859 align:start position:0%
two other items to consider
 
02:41:58.190 --> 02:41:58.200 align:start position:0%
boats do not have seat belts nothing to
 
02:41:59.870 --> 02:41:59.880 align:start position:0%
keep a passenger in a boat should the
 
02:42:01.969 --> 02:42:01.979 align:start position:0%
driver have to throttle back at 65 miles
 
02:42:04.309 --> 02:42:04.319 align:start position:0%
an hour to neutral or should it get hit
 
02:42:06.710 --> 02:42:06.720 align:start position:0%
by another boat or run aground there are
 
02:42:08.450 --> 02:42:08.460 align:start position:0%
no airbags no roof nothing for
 
02:42:09.950 --> 02:42:09.960 align:start position:0%
protecting the passenger from being
 
02:42:11.510 --> 02:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
ejected should a dangerous situation
 
02:42:11.520 --> 02:42:12.950 align:start position:0%
ejected should a dangerous situation
occur

02:42:12.950 --> 02:42:12.960 align:start position:0%
occur
 
02:42:14.630 --> 02:42:14.640 align:start position:0%
think of the interstate we do not allow
 
02:42:16.309 --> 02:42:16.319 align:start position:0%
bicycles and pedestrians on the
 
02:42:18.170 --> 02:42:18.180 align:start position:0%
interstate because of the speed limit
 
02:42:20.210 --> 02:42:20.220 align:start position:0%
having a boat going 65 miles an hour
 
02:42:22.610 --> 02:42:22.620 align:start position:0%
near someone canoeing kayaking or
 
02:42:25.550 --> 02:42:25.560 align:start position:0%
sailing can be a recipe for disaster
 
02:42:27.410 --> 02:42:27.420 align:start position:0%
although these motor boats have just as
 
02:42:29.990 --> 02:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
much right to the lake again as anyone
 
02:42:32.510 --> 02:42:32.520 align:start position:0%
else there needs to be a balance
 
02:42:34.130 --> 02:42:34.140 align:start position:0%
in summary the department of safety is
 
02:42:35.510 --> 02:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
not recommended passage of this
 
02:42:37.610 --> 02:42:37.620 align:start position:0%
legislation it creates an enhanced
 
02:42:39.469 --> 02:42:39.479 align:start position:0%
concern for safety of all users in this
 
02:42:41.570 --> 02:42:41.580 align:start position:0%
area will cause confusion among voters
 
02:42:43.610 --> 02:42:43.620 align:start position:0%
especially those who are unfamiliar with
 
02:42:44.630 --> 02:42:44.640 align:start position:0%
the lake
 
02:42:46.490 --> 02:42:46.500 align:start position:0%
and as presented does not allow for
 
02:42:48.530 --> 02:42:48.540 align:start position:0%
proper enforcement on the Zone based on
 
02:42:51.170 --> 02:42:51.180 align:start position:0%
the description of the area
 
02:42:53.090 --> 02:42:53.100 align:start position:0%
thank you lieutenant does anyone have
 
02:42:54.469 --> 02:42:54.479 align:start position:0%
any questions for the lieutenant
 
02:42:56.030 --> 02:42:56.040 align:start position:0%
representative Darby
 
02:42:57.710 --> 02:42:57.720 align:start position:0%
will you take questions Lieutenant
 
02:42:57.720 --> 02:43:00.170 align:start position:0%
will you take questions Lieutenant
absolutely

02:43:00.170 --> 02:43:00.180 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:01.429 --> 02:43:01.439 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
02:43:01.439 --> 02:43:02.510 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you for taking my
question

02:43:02.510 --> 02:43:02.520 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:43:05.150 --> 02:43:05.160 align:start position:0%
in online testimony we heard a number of
 
02:43:05.160 --> 02:43:06.230 align:start position:0%
in online testimony we heard a number of
people

02:43:06.230 --> 02:43:06.240 align:start position:0%
people
 
02:43:10.370 --> 02:43:10.380 align:start position:0%
um comment on the the decrease in Marine
 
02:43:12.050 --> 02:43:12.060 align:start position:0%
Patrol on Lakewood Massacre
 
02:43:12.060 --> 02:43:13.190 align:start position:0%
Patrol on Lakewood Massacre
Winnipesaukee

02:43:13.190 --> 02:43:13.200 align:start position:0%
Winnipesaukee
 
02:43:16.309 --> 02:43:16.319 align:start position:0%
myself having a uh a camp on a small
 
02:43:18.230 --> 02:43:18.240 align:start position:0%
Lake in Southwest New Hampshire have
 
02:43:20.990 --> 02:43:21.000 align:start position:0%
also noticed a significant decrease in
 
02:43:23.150 --> 02:43:23.160 align:start position:0%
Marine Patrol I was wondering if you
 
02:43:25.910 --> 02:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
felt if you if the department of safety
 
02:43:27.370 --> 02:43:27.380 align:start position:0%
feels that the
 
02:43:29.690 --> 02:43:29.700 align:start position:0%
coverage Marine Patrol Patrol patrol
 
02:43:32.510 --> 02:43:32.520 align:start position:0%
coverage is adequate and if not if you
 
02:43:35.270 --> 02:43:35.280 align:start position:0%
could comment on why there's why there's
 
02:43:37.670 --> 02:43:37.680 align:start position:0%
a decrease in the Marine patrol coverage
 
02:43:38.929 --> 02:43:38.939 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:43:40.429 --> 02:43:40.439 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:43:42.830 --> 02:43:42.840 align:start position:0%
um no it's not adequate
 
02:43:42.840 --> 02:43:43.450 align:start position:0%
um no it's not adequate
um

02:43:43.450 --> 02:43:43.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:43:45.650 --> 02:43:45.660 align:start position:0%
reasoning it's probably like every every
 
02:43:47.570 --> 02:43:47.580 align:start position:0%
other law enforcement agency in in the
 
02:43:49.130 --> 02:43:49.140 align:start position:0%
state in the country everybody's having
 
02:43:51.590 --> 02:43:51.600 align:start position:0%
a hard time filling these positions
 
02:43:54.889 --> 02:43:54.899 align:start position:0%
um unlike many other agencies we have
 
02:43:59.330 --> 02:43:59.340 align:start position:0%
mostly a seasonal or part-time staff we
 
02:44:02.170 --> 02:44:02.180 align:start position:0%
only have uh nine full-time staff
 
02:44:04.429 --> 02:44:04.439 align:start position:0%
throughout the year as far as law
 
02:44:04.439 --> 02:44:05.690 align:start position:0%
throughout the year as far as law
enforcement

02:44:05.690 --> 02:44:05.700 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
02:44:08.950 --> 02:44:08.960 align:start position:0%
uh the other the rest of them are
 
02:44:11.270 --> 02:44:11.280 align:start position:0%
seasonal staff some who actually work
 
02:44:13.370 --> 02:44:13.380 align:start position:0%
throughout the year but many who do just
 
02:44:15.830 --> 02:44:15.840 align:start position:0%
what you expect coming around April May
 
02:44:18.469 --> 02:44:18.479 align:start position:0%
maybe June work throughout the summer
 
02:44:19.849 --> 02:44:19.859 align:start position:0%
um and then go back to their other jobs
 
02:44:22.790 --> 02:44:22.800 align:start position:0%
many are retired many are college kids
 
02:44:25.790 --> 02:44:25.800 align:start position:0%
um so we are definitely below below what
 
02:44:27.230 --> 02:44:27.240 align:start position:0%
we would like to see for our staffing
 
02:44:29.690 --> 02:44:29.700 align:start position:0%
and it's it's certainly an issue with
 
02:44:31.990 --> 02:44:32.000 align:start position:0%
enforcement uh being out there being
 
02:44:34.030 --> 02:44:34.040 align:start position:0%
being present
 
02:44:36.230 --> 02:44:36.240 align:start position:0%
and just letting people know we're out
 
02:44:38.750 --> 02:44:38.760 align:start position:0%
there so it's a very difficult thing to
 
02:44:41.510 --> 02:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
do and it's it's we're always weighing
 
02:44:43.790 --> 02:44:43.800 align:start position:0%
where we need to be and and how many of
 
02:44:46.309 --> 02:44:46.319 align:start position:0%
us should be there
 
02:44:49.550 --> 02:44:49.560 align:start position:0%
any other questions for the lieutenant
 
02:44:51.410 --> 02:44:51.420 align:start position:0%
I don't see any thank you lieutenant for
 
02:44:52.490 --> 02:44:52.500 align:start position:0%
your testimony
 
02:44:55.370 --> 02:44:55.380 align:start position:0%
before I ask Mr Vogel to come up I have
 
02:44:58.730 --> 02:44:58.740 align:start position:0%
about 23 cards all opposed to this bill
 
02:45:01.910 --> 02:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
of run out of cards for anyone in favor
 
02:45:04.610 --> 02:45:04.620 align:start position:0%
and we normally alternate is there
 
02:45:07.849 --> 02:45:07.859 align:start position:0%
anyone else to speak in favor that
 
02:45:11.510 --> 02:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
hasn't entered a pink card
 
02:45:13.730 --> 02:45:13.740 align:start position:0%
I'll ask one more time anybody else in
 
02:45:17.630 --> 02:45:17.640 align:start position:0%
favor that hasn't filled out a pink card
 
02:45:19.969 --> 02:45:19.979 align:start position:0%
hearing none I'll ask Mr Vogel to come
 
02:45:41.510 --> 02:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:43.670 --> 02:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chairman and committee
 
02:45:45.469 --> 02:45:45.479 align:start position:0%
members for the record my name is Harry
 
02:45:47.210 --> 02:45:47.220 align:start position:0%
Vogel I am the senior biologist and
 
02:45:48.889 --> 02:45:48.899 align:start position:0%
executive director of elune preservation
 
02:45:50.870 --> 02:45:50.880 align:start position:0%
committee I also sit on the
 
02:45:52.550 --> 02:45:52.560 align:start position:0%
Environmental Policy Committee of New
 
02:45:54.050 --> 02:45:54.060 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Audubon and I'm representing
 
02:45:56.690 --> 02:45:56.700 align:start position:0%
that organization as well this afternoon
 
02:45:58.309 --> 02:45:58.319 align:start position:0%
learn preservation Committee in New
 
02:46:00.710 --> 02:46:00.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Audubon opposed House Bill 448
 
02:46:03.230 --> 02:46:03.240 align:start position:0%
for two reasons the first reason is
 
02:46:06.050 --> 02:46:06.060 align:start position:0%
concerns about our loon population
 
02:46:08.150 --> 02:46:08.160 align:start position:0%
loons are a state-threatened species in
 
02:46:10.490 --> 02:46:10.500 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire lpc's intensive management
 
02:46:12.889 --> 02:46:12.899 align:start position:0%
has more than tripled the population of
 
02:46:15.590 --> 02:46:15.600 align:start position:0%
lewins in this state but loons face some
 
02:46:17.090 --> 02:46:17.100 align:start position:0%
big challenges including the challenge
 
02:46:18.530 --> 02:46:18.540 align:start position:0%
of fast-moving boats and personal
 
02:46:18.540 --> 02:46:20.090 align:start position:0%
of fast-moving boats and personal
watercraft

02:46:20.090 --> 02:46:20.100 align:start position:0%
watercraft
 
02:46:21.530 --> 02:46:21.540 align:start position:0%
collisions with boats and personal
 
02:46:25.490 --> 02:46:25.500 align:start position:0%
watercraft account for 13.8 percent of
 
02:46:27.530 --> 02:46:27.540 align:start position:0%
known causes of adult loon deaths on
 
02:46:30.170 --> 02:46:30.180 align:start position:0%
Winnipesaukee that is eight times the
 
02:46:32.630 --> 02:46:32.640 align:start position:0%
percentage of other lakes in the state
 
02:46:34.969 --> 02:46:34.979 align:start position:0%
mortalities from both collisions also
 
02:46:37.070 --> 02:46:37.080 align:start position:0%
affect loon nesting success because once
 
02:46:39.530 --> 02:46:39.540 align:start position:0%
you lose a member of a loon pair it can
 
02:46:41.690 --> 02:46:41.700 align:start position:0%
be years before elune finds a new mate
 
02:46:44.690 --> 02:46:44.700 align:start position:0%
and returns to productivity
 
02:46:46.849 --> 02:46:46.859 align:start position:0%
boat collisions also affect the survival
 
02:46:50.090 --> 02:46:50.100 align:start position:0%
of loon chicks young loons are small and
 
02:46:52.670 --> 02:46:52.680 align:start position:0%
dark they are not easily seen by boaters
 
02:46:54.290 --> 02:46:54.300 align:start position:0%
and they are too buoyant to dive away
 
02:46:56.090 --> 02:46:56.100 align:start position:0%
from a fast-moving boat
 
02:46:57.950 --> 02:46:57.960 align:start position:0%
those fast-moving boats are very common
 
02:47:00.590 --> 02:47:00.600 align:start position:0%
on Lake Winnipesaukee and loons on
 
02:47:02.510 --> 02:47:02.520 align:start position:0%
Winnipesaukee have seen larger declines
 
02:47:04.309 --> 02:47:04.319 align:start position:0%
in their population and their breeding
 
02:47:06.230 --> 02:47:06.240 align:start position:0%
success compared to lewins and other
 
02:47:07.969 --> 02:47:07.979 align:start position:0%
areas of the state
 
02:47:10.070 --> 02:47:10.080 align:start position:0%
the loom population on Winnipesaukee is
 
02:47:12.050 --> 02:47:12.060 align:start position:0%
decline from an historical level of 40
 
02:47:14.330 --> 02:47:14.340 align:start position:0%
to 50 pairs to an average of just 28
 
02:47:14.340 --> 02:47:15.830 align:start position:0%
to 50 pairs to an average of just 28
pairs

02:47:15.830 --> 02:47:15.840 align:start position:0%
pairs
 
02:47:17.330 --> 02:47:17.340 align:start position:0%
collisions with boats and personal
 
02:47:19.130 --> 02:47:19.140 align:start position:0%
watercraft are one of the largest known
 
02:47:21.290 --> 02:47:21.300 align:start position:0%
causes of living chick mortality on
 
02:47:24.230 --> 02:47:24.240 align:start position:0%
Winnipesaukee fewer than 7 out of 10
 
02:47:26.389 --> 02:47:26.399 align:start position:0%
loon chicks that are hatched on Winnie
 
02:47:29.330 --> 02:47:29.340 align:start position:0%
survive to fledging that's 10 below the
 
02:47:30.889 --> 02:47:30.899 align:start position:0%
Statewide average
 
02:47:32.870 --> 02:47:32.880 align:start position:0%
loons on Winnipesaukee have fledged
 
02:47:35.809 --> 02:47:35.819 align:start position:0%
fewer than 0.4 chicks per pair per year
 
02:47:39.410 --> 02:47:39.420 align:start position:0%
on the lake that is 19 below the
 
02:47:41.150 --> 02:47:41.160 align:start position:0%
Statewide average and that breeding
 
02:47:42.830 --> 02:47:42.840 align:start position:0%
success is not enough to maintain a
 
02:47:46.309 --> 02:47:46.319 align:start position:0%
viable population of loons on the lake
 
02:47:48.590 --> 02:47:48.600 align:start position:0%
the second reason that loon preservation
 
02:47:49.910 --> 02:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
Committee in New Hampshire Audubon
 
02:47:52.130 --> 02:47:52.140 align:start position:0%
opposed this bill is concerns about our
 
02:47:54.050 --> 02:47:54.060 align:start position:0%
biologists and our volunteers on the
 
02:47:54.060 --> 02:47:54.889 align:start position:0%
biologists and our volunteers on the
lake

02:47:54.889 --> 02:47:54.899 align:start position:0%
lake
 
02:47:56.630 --> 02:47:56.640 align:start position:0%
so this summer the loom preservation
 
02:47:58.969 --> 02:47:58.979 align:start position:0%
committee will have 12 biologists on New
 
02:48:00.710 --> 02:48:00.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's Lakes working for the public
 
02:48:03.110 --> 02:48:03.120 align:start position:0%
good and to protect the socially and
 
02:48:05.870 --> 02:48:05.880 align:start position:0%
economically important Wildlife species
 
02:48:07.610 --> 02:48:07.620 align:start position:0%
some of those biologists will be on Lake
 
02:48:09.290 --> 02:48:09.300 align:start position:0%
Winnipesaukee and they will spend more
 
02:48:11.330 --> 02:48:11.340 align:start position:0%
than 400 hours on the lake in a small
 
02:48:14.210 --> 02:48:14.220 align:start position:0%
Boston Whaler our boats have a top speed
 
02:48:16.429 --> 02:48:16.439 align:start position:0%
of about 35 miles an hour but they will
 
02:48:18.050 --> 02:48:18.060 align:start position:0%
be able to cover the entire Lake very
 
02:48:18.060 --> 02:48:18.889 align:start position:0%
be able to cover the entire Lake very
well

02:48:18.889 --> 02:48:18.899 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:48:21.530 --> 02:48:21.540 align:start position:0%
over the years as we have seen more and
 
02:48:23.690 --> 02:48:23.700 align:start position:0%
faster boats on Winnipesaukee I have had
 
02:48:25.730 --> 02:48:25.740 align:start position:0%
increasing concerns about the safety of
 
02:48:27.889 --> 02:48:27.899 align:start position:0%
our biologists and our volunteers on the
 
02:48:29.630 --> 02:48:29.640 align:start position:0%
lake and speed limits have helped to
 
02:48:32.510 --> 02:48:32.520 align:start position:0%
alleviate some of those concerns
 
02:48:34.550 --> 02:48:34.560 align:start position:0%
and the final point that I would like to
 
02:48:36.110 --> 02:48:36.120 align:start position:0%
make is that loons are the tip of the
 
02:48:38.030 --> 02:48:38.040 align:start position:0%
iceberg and so the same things that are
 
02:48:40.070 --> 02:48:40.080 align:start position:0%
affecting loons are affecting mergansers
 
02:48:42.050 --> 02:48:42.060 align:start position:0%
and mallards and otters and other
 
02:48:42.060 --> 02:48:43.250 align:start position:0%
and mallards and otters and other
wildlife

02:48:43.250 --> 02:48:43.260 align:start position:0%
wildlife
 
02:48:45.110 --> 02:48:45.120 align:start position:0%
loons and our other Lake Wildlife bring
 
02:48:47.630 --> 02:48:47.640 align:start position:0%
residents and visitors to our state they
 
02:48:49.610 --> 02:48:49.620 align:start position:0%
contribute to our economy and to the
 
02:48:52.130 --> 02:48:52.140 align:start position:0%
spirit that makes our Lakes special to
 
02:48:53.929 --> 02:48:53.939 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's residents and visitors
 
02:48:55.849 --> 02:48:55.859 align:start position:0%
it would be a shame to lose the very
 
02:48:57.889 --> 02:48:57.899 align:start position:0%
qualities that have attracted both loons
 
02:49:00.530 --> 02:49:00.540 align:start position:0%
and people to our Lakes so the Loon
 
02:49:01.849 --> 02:49:01.859 align:start position:0%
preservation committee and New Hampshire
 
02:49:04.250 --> 02:49:04.260 align:start position:0%
Audubon support limiting excessive speed
 
02:49:06.950 --> 02:49:06.960 align:start position:0%
on our lakes and so we oppose House Bill
 
02:49:09.650 --> 02:49:09.660 align:start position:0%
448 that is the end of my testimony I
 
02:49:11.450 --> 02:49:11.460 align:start position:0%
would be happy to take any questions we
 
02:49:14.510 --> 02:49:14.520 align:start position:0%
have any questions for Mr Vogel
 
02:49:16.429 --> 02:49:16.439 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
02:49:17.450 --> 02:49:17.460 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:49:22.250 --> 02:49:22.260 align:start position:0%
up next Mr strodl on Deck Mr Ratcliffe
 
02:49:25.190 --> 02:49:25.200 align:start position:0%
Mr strodel
 
02:49:26.750 --> 02:49:26.760 align:start position:0%
can you turn on the mic you have to
 
02:49:28.730 --> 02:49:28.740 align:start position:0%
press the button so it goes red there
 
02:49:30.050 --> 02:49:30.060 align:start position:0%
you go
 
02:49:32.510 --> 02:49:32.520 align:start position:0%
good afternoon my name is Bob strodel I
 
02:49:34.849 --> 02:49:34.859 align:start position:0%
am a longtime New Hampshire resident I'm
 
02:49:37.250 --> 02:49:37.260 align:start position:0%
a second generation camp director
 
02:49:38.630 --> 02:49:38.640 align:start position:0%
and I've been in charge of camp
 
02:49:41.809 --> 02:49:41.819 align:start position:0%
brookwoods and Camp Deer Run for 30
 
02:49:44.030 --> 02:49:44.040 align:start position:0%
years we also operate a camp called
 
02:49:46.790 --> 02:49:46.800 align:start position:0%
Moose River Outpost in Maine
 
02:49:49.490 --> 02:49:49.500 align:start position:0%
let me tell you how happy I am to be
 
02:49:51.410 --> 02:49:51.420 align:start position:0%
running two camps in New Hampshire and
 
02:49:53.270 --> 02:49:53.280 align:start position:0%
not two camps in Maine it is hard to run
 
02:49:54.950 --> 02:49:54.960 align:start position:0%
a camp in Maine so thank you for all the
 
02:49:56.929 --> 02:49:56.939 align:start position:0%
good stuff you're doing help support New
 
02:49:58.610 --> 02:49:58.620 align:start position:0%
Hampshire camps
 
02:50:01.190 --> 02:50:01.200 align:start position:0%
we are opposed this bill
 
02:50:03.110 --> 02:50:03.120 align:start position:0%
for the basic reasons we're concerned
 
02:50:05.389 --> 02:50:05.399 align:start position:0%
about safety there are approximately 14
 
02:50:08.690 --> 02:50:08.700 align:start position:0%
camps on Lake matasaki there's only
 
02:50:10.370 --> 02:50:10.380 align:start position:0%
about three McDonald's around the lake
 
02:50:12.230 --> 02:50:12.240 align:start position:0%
and I'm not sure how many Dollar
 
02:50:14.150 --> 02:50:14.160 align:start position:0%
Generals but there's a lot of camps
 
02:50:15.469 --> 02:50:15.479 align:start position:0%
around the lake we've got up to a
 
02:50:17.690 --> 02:50:17.700 align:start position:0%
thousand campers that are Lake alone and
 
02:50:19.790 --> 02:50:19.800 align:start position:0%
we represent along with the other camps
 
02:50:21.050 --> 02:50:21.060 align:start position:0%
approximately a third of a billion
 
02:50:22.969 --> 02:50:22.979 align:start position:0%
dollars as far as input
 
02:50:25.790 --> 02:50:25.800 align:start position:0%
the reason I oppose this is considered
 
02:50:28.490 --> 02:50:28.500 align:start position:0%
safety that's the bottom line I don't
 
02:50:30.530 --> 02:50:30.540 align:start position:0%
care about the hydrodynamics I care
 
02:50:32.270 --> 02:50:32.280 align:start position:0%
about the safety of the kids
 
02:50:33.950 --> 02:50:33.960 align:start position:0%
look over at this wall right over here
 
02:50:33.960 --> 02:50:35.210 align:start position:0%
look over at this wall right over here
first

02:50:35.210 --> 02:50:35.220 align:start position:0%
first
 
02:50:37.250 --> 02:50:37.260 align:start position:0%
now look at this wall over here
 
02:50:39.530 --> 02:50:39.540 align:start position:0%
in less than a second a boat traveling
 
02:50:41.570 --> 02:50:41.580 align:start position:0%
at 65 miles an hour will transfers that
 
02:50:41.580 --> 02:50:42.469 align:start position:0%
at 65 miles an hour will transfers that
distance

02:50:42.469 --> 02:50:42.479 align:start position:0%
distance
 
02:50:44.330 --> 02:50:44.340 align:start position:0%
and a camper cannot get out of the way
 
02:50:47.389 --> 02:50:47.399 align:start position:0%
if you can't present a canoe a kayak or
 
02:50:49.790 --> 02:50:49.800 align:start position:0%
a sailboat so we'd appreciate it if you
 
02:50:54.349 --> 02:50:54.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:56.270 --> 02:50:56.280 align:start position:0%
you accept questions
 
02:50:58.070 --> 02:50:58.080 align:start position:0%
anybody have any questions for Mr
 
02:50:58.080 --> 02:50:59.870 align:start position:0%
anybody have any questions for Mr

02:51:25.550 --> 02:51:25.560 align:start position:0%
addition to that I have a master ocean

02:51:37.560 --> 02:51:38.630 align:start position:0%

years

02:51:38.630 --> 02:51:38.640 align:start position:0%
years
 
02:51:40.670 --> 02:51:40.680 align:start position:0%
over the 30 years on the big lake I've
 
02:51:42.590 --> 02:51:42.600 align:start position:0%
watched the situation deteriorate as the
 
02:51:44.809 --> 02:51:44.819 align:start position:0%
go fast boats take whatever piece of the
 
02:51:46.849 --> 02:51:46.859 align:start position:0%
water they wanted pushing the kayakers
 
02:51:48.530 --> 02:51:48.540 align:start position:0%
canoers and anyone on smaller slower
 
02:51:50.630 --> 02:51:50.640 align:start position:0%
Boats off the water out of fear
 
02:51:52.670 --> 02:51:52.680 align:start position:0%
I've watched commentary and local social
 
02:51:55.190 --> 02:51:55.200 align:start position:0%
media people being swamped by boaters
 
02:51:57.469 --> 02:51:57.479 align:start position:0%
ignoring wake zones right of way and the
 
02:51:59.210 --> 02:51:59.220 align:start position:0%
response from any was the laughing emoji
 
02:52:01.429 --> 02:52:01.439 align:start position:0%
and you should get a bigger boat
 
02:52:03.349 --> 02:52:03.359 align:start position:0%
indeed one couple I know in their late
 
02:52:05.809 --> 02:52:05.819 align:start position:0%
70s having their lunch at anchor within
 
02:52:07.969 --> 02:52:07.979 align:start position:0%
150 feet of a shoreline
 
02:52:09.950 --> 02:52:09.960 align:start position:0%
were swamped so badly they had five
 
02:52:11.809 --> 02:52:11.819 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars damages to their boat
 
02:52:14.030 --> 02:52:14.040 align:start position:0%
they were knocked around the boat and
 
02:52:15.410 --> 02:52:15.420 align:start position:0%
fortunately while they were not injured
 
02:52:17.210 --> 02:52:17.220 align:start position:0%
they easily could have been
 
02:52:18.530 --> 02:52:18.540 align:start position:0%
there's no doubt we've lost
 
02:52:20.990 --> 02:52:21.000 align:start position:0%
consideration for others on this Lake
 
02:52:23.269 --> 02:52:23.279 align:start position:0%
in the course of my career I worked
 
02:52:25.190 --> 02:52:25.200 align:start position:0%
aboard a high-speed vessel at Westpac
 
02:52:26.809 --> 02:52:26.819 align:start position:0%
Express and service to the Marine Corps
 
02:52:29.510 --> 02:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
in the mid-2000s on that vessel which
 
02:52:31.370 --> 02:52:31.380 align:start position:0%
had a maximum speed of approximately 40
 
02:52:35.150 --> 02:52:35.160 align:start position:0%
knots on open ocean not 65 Plus in
 
02:52:37.250 --> 02:52:37.260 align:start position:0%
enclosed Waters full of skiers kayakers
 
02:52:40.370 --> 02:52:40.380 align:start position:0%
and yes there are kayakers in the broads
 
02:52:42.110 --> 02:52:42.120 align:start position:0%
Crossing between the iron the swimmers
 
02:52:43.910 --> 02:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
also we had to maintain a bridge watch
 
02:52:46.429 --> 02:52:46.439 align:start position:0%
on that vessel as follows two men in
 
02:52:49.010 --> 02:52:49.020 align:start position:0%
control chairs at all times with an arms
 
02:52:51.349 --> 02:52:51.359 align:start position:0%
reaching the throttles one licensed
 
02:52:52.670 --> 02:52:52.680 align:start position:0%
engineer sitting in a command chair
 
02:52:54.889 --> 02:52:54.899 align:start position:0%
above and behind us whose job was to act
 
02:52:56.809 --> 02:52:56.819 align:start position:0%
as a third Lookout
 
02:53:01.010 --> 02:53:01.020 align:start position:0%
on this vessel we had ectus arpa AIS and
 
02:53:02.870 --> 02:53:02.880 align:start position:0%
other modern safety features
 
02:53:04.969 --> 02:53:04.979 align:start position:0%
on that vessel if I wish to get up and
 
02:53:06.889 --> 02:53:06.899 align:start position:0%
relieve myself I had to have the chief
 
02:53:09.050 --> 02:53:09.060 align:start position:0%
engineer in the chair behind me and the
 
02:53:11.210 --> 02:53:11.220 align:start position:0%
other command chair occupied just to be
 
02:53:13.010 --> 02:53:13.020 align:start position:0%
able to stand up
 
02:53:15.050 --> 02:53:15.060 align:start position:0%
there's no distractions on such a vessel
 
02:53:16.910 --> 02:53:16.920 align:start position:0%
no music no visitors and obviously no
 
02:53:16.920 --> 02:53:18.290 align:start position:0%
no music no visitors and obviously no
alcohol

02:53:18.290 --> 02:53:18.300 align:start position:0%
alcohol
 
02:53:20.330 --> 02:53:20.340 align:start position:0%
let's contrast this with a go fast vote
 
02:53:22.550 --> 02:53:22.560 align:start position:0%
on the lake with kids on board or beers
 
02:53:24.410 --> 02:53:24.420 align:start position:0%
in hand or sometimes both
 
02:53:26.510 --> 02:53:26.520 align:start position:0%
towels and toys flying about the boat at
 
02:53:28.490 --> 02:53:28.500 align:start position:0%
all speed all of which are distractions
 
02:53:30.889 --> 02:53:30.899 align:start position:0%
to the operator no formal training no
 
02:53:33.110 --> 02:53:33.120 align:start position:0%
collision avoidance equipment the boat's
 
02:53:34.790 --> 02:53:34.800 align:start position:0%
operating in constricted Waters with
 
02:53:37.429 --> 02:53:37.439 align:start position:0%
small buoys kayaks wakeboarders and the
 
02:53:39.710 --> 02:53:39.720 align:start position:0%
occasional swimmer as I mentioned
 
02:53:40.969 --> 02:53:40.979 align:start position:0%
earlier I've been on this Lake for over
 
02:53:42.050 --> 02:53:42.060 align:start position:0%
30 years
 
02:53:44.150 --> 02:53:44.160 align:start position:0%
in that 30 years I've been swamped
 
02:53:45.290 --> 02:53:45.300 align:start position:0%
several times
 
02:53:47.630 --> 02:53:47.640 align:start position:0%
I've had many close calls each time it
 
02:53:50.269 --> 02:53:50.279 align:start position:0%
was about operating at excess of speed
 
02:53:51.950 --> 02:53:51.960 align:start position:0%
in the two cases where I called the
 
02:53:53.690 --> 02:53:53.700 align:start position:0%
Marine Patrol and the operator was
 
02:53:55.969 --> 02:53:55.979 align:start position:0%
stopped alcohol wasn't a factor speed
 
02:53:57.710 --> 02:53:57.720 align:start position:0%
and stupidity were
 
02:53:59.690 --> 02:53:59.700 align:start position:0%
the lake is becoming a wild west of
 
02:54:01.550 --> 02:54:01.560 align:start position:0%
boating with those who have the biggest
 
02:54:03.290 --> 02:54:03.300 align:start position:0%
fastest boats climbing the right of way
 
02:54:05.330 --> 02:54:05.340 align:start position:0%
having the money to buy a bigger faster
 
02:54:08.090 --> 02:54:08.100 align:start position:0%
boat has no correlation to experience or
 
02:54:10.610 --> 02:54:10.620 align:start position:0%
nautical skills the lake just isn't big
 
02:54:12.410 --> 02:54:12.420 align:start position:0%
enough or open enough for boats to
 
02:54:14.510 --> 02:54:14.520 align:start position:0%
operate at least be as requested there's
 
02:54:16.490 --> 02:54:16.500 align:start position:0%
no time savings and attempts to claim
 
02:54:18.950 --> 02:54:18.960 align:start position:0%
that this is is just an excuse if you do
 
02:54:20.750 --> 02:54:20.760 align:start position:0%
the math the speed difference between
 
02:54:22.490 --> 02:54:22.500 align:start position:0%
the current speed limit and about doing
 
02:54:25.130 --> 02:54:25.140 align:start position:0%
80 miles an hour traversing the broads
 
02:54:27.050 --> 02:54:27.060 align:start position:0%
ends up to a difference of four minutes
 
02:54:28.490 --> 02:54:28.500 align:start position:0%
that's from the southern temperature
 
02:54:31.010 --> 02:54:31.020 align:start position:0%
rattlesnake to Sandy Island
 
02:54:33.769 --> 02:54:33.779 align:start position:0%
it's all about the fun Factor and that
 
02:54:35.269 --> 02:54:35.279 align:start position:0%
person's fund shouldn't outweigh the
 
02:54:37.370 --> 02:54:37.380 align:start position:0%
safety of others if you don't have four
 
02:54:38.870 --> 02:54:38.880 align:start position:0%
minutes to spare then maybe you should
 
02:54:41.929 --> 02:54:41.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:43.849 --> 02:54:43.859 align:start position:0%
thank you does anyone have any questions
 
02:54:46.010 --> 02:54:46.020 align:start position:0%
for Mr Radcliffe
 
02:54:51.650 --> 02:54:51.660 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:56.809 --> 02:54:56.819 align:start position:0%
Miss Lemay on Deck Mr Hutchins
 
02:55:00.050 --> 02:55:00.060 align:start position:0%
hello hi my name is Kate Lemay um I just
 
02:55:01.429 --> 02:55:01.439 align:start position:0%
want to first thank you all for your
 
02:55:04.429 --> 02:55:04.439 align:start position:0%
service to our communities and just the
 
02:55:06.710 --> 02:55:06.720 align:start position:0%
people that have spoken I think the the
 
02:55:09.429 --> 02:55:09.439 align:start position:0%
care and thoughtfulness they put into
 
02:55:13.670 --> 02:55:13.680 align:start position:0%
their points is really important
 
02:55:16.370 --> 02:55:16.380 align:start position:0%
um so I am the senior executive director
 
02:55:19.910 --> 02:55:19.920 align:start position:0%
at the YMCA camps of greater Boston and
 
02:55:22.429 --> 02:55:22.439 align:start position:0%
they own Sandy Island which is at the
 
02:55:24.950 --> 02:55:24.960 align:start position:0%
corner of the broads in this uh in the
 
02:55:28.370 --> 02:55:28.380 align:start position:0%
map where this is affected my statement
 
02:55:30.410 --> 02:55:30.420 align:start position:0%
is that we're opposed to the increased
 
02:55:33.050 --> 02:55:33.060 align:start position:0%
speed limit obviously because of camper
 
02:55:36.230 --> 02:55:36.240 align:start position:0%
safety but what I would also say just in
 
02:55:38.870 --> 02:55:38.880 align:start position:0%
being here is that
 
02:55:42.349 --> 02:55:42.359 align:start position:0%
if this restriction happens and the
 
02:55:44.410 --> 02:55:44.420 align:start position:0%
decision is that this is the one spot
 
02:55:48.830 --> 02:55:48.840 align:start position:0%
where boats can go 65 miles an hour
 
02:55:52.010 --> 02:55:52.020 align:start position:0%
it is going to concentrate that speed
 
02:55:55.370 --> 02:55:55.380 align:start position:0%
into this section of the lake and our
 
02:55:59.450 --> 02:55:59.460 align:start position:0%
camp services about a thousand people a
 
02:56:02.030 --> 02:56:02.040 align:start position:0%
summer but many of them are families
 
02:56:04.610 --> 02:56:04.620 align:start position:0%
with young kids and one of the great
 
02:56:07.370 --> 02:56:07.380 align:start position:0%
aspects of our property in this facility
 
02:56:08.929 --> 02:56:08.939 align:start position:0%
is that
 
02:56:11.389 --> 02:56:11.399 align:start position:0%
once you pass a swim test you're able to
 
02:56:13.309 --> 02:56:13.319 align:start position:0%
sail around the island paddle board
 
02:56:17.090 --> 02:56:17.100 align:start position:0%
kayak it's it's safety is one of the key
 
02:56:21.290 --> 02:56:21.300 align:start position:0%
aspects of this Camp so
 
02:56:23.630 --> 02:56:23.640 align:start position:0%
um I would say that I'm just really
 
02:56:25.670 --> 02:56:25.680 align:start position:0%
grateful that the speed limit is
 
02:56:28.849 --> 02:56:28.859 align:start position:0%
currently 45 because I think that
 
02:56:28.859 --> 02:56:30.290 align:start position:0%
currently 45 because I think that
people

02:56:30.290 --> 02:56:30.300 align:start position:0%
people
 
02:56:33.050 --> 02:56:33.060 align:start position:0%
as you increase the speed limit their
 
02:56:34.910 --> 02:56:34.920 align:start position:0%
decisions of what they can do to go
 
02:56:37.730 --> 02:56:37.740 align:start position:0%
faster is just going to increase so that
 
02:56:41.450 --> 02:56:41.460 align:start position:0%
isn't just 65 65 could meet 85 65 could
 
02:56:45.050 --> 02:56:45.060 align:start position:0%
mean 75 and concentrating it in the
 
02:56:48.290 --> 02:56:48.300 align:start position:0%
broads has a significant I mean it's
 
02:56:50.570 --> 02:56:50.580 align:start position:0%
right it touches half the property of
 
02:56:52.910 --> 02:56:52.920 align:start position:0%
this island so I'm just grateful that
 
02:56:56.990 --> 02:56:57.000 align:start position:0%
the speed limit's 45 for now thanks
 
02:56:58.610 --> 02:56:58.620 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony any
 
02:56:58.620 --> 02:57:00.650 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony any
questions

02:57:00.650 --> 02:57:00.660 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:57:04.610 --> 02:57:04.620 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:07.010 --> 02:57:07.020 align:start position:0%
next up Mr Hutch

been involved in serious safety
 
02:57:39.110 --> 02:57:39.120 align:start position:0%
situations that happen very quickly like
 
02:57:41.389 --> 02:57:41.399 align:start position:0%
you I have devoted my time and efforts
 
02:57:43.130 --> 02:57:43.140 align:start position:0%
for the people of New Hampshire
 
02:57:46.490 --> 02:57:46.500 align:start position:0%
I have served the 34 communities of the
 
02:57:48.230 --> 02:57:48.240 align:start position:0%
Lakes Region Planning Commission for
 
02:57:50.750 --> 02:57:50.760 align:start position:0%
over a dozen years on its executive
 
02:57:53.690 --> 02:57:53.700 align:start position:0%
committee serving as chair for multiple
 
02:57:53.700 --> 02:57:54.650 align:start position:0%
committee serving as chair for multiple
years

02:57:54.650 --> 02:57:54.660 align:start position:0%
years
 
02:57:56.809 --> 02:57:56.819 align:start position:0%
this commission supported the speed
 
02:57:59.570 --> 02:57:59.580 align:start position:0%
limits of 45 30 on the big lake
 
02:58:01.730 --> 02:58:01.740 align:start position:0%
during these years I also serve the
 
02:58:03.650 --> 02:58:03.660 align:start position:0%
people of Laconia as chair of the
 
02:58:04.969 --> 02:58:04.979 align:start position:0%
planning board
 
02:58:08.090 --> 02:58:08.100 align:start position:0%
the Laconia city council also supported
 
02:58:10.490 --> 02:58:10.500 align:start position:0%
the speed limits on the lake to promote
 
02:58:13.550 --> 02:58:13.560 align:start position:0%
safety and economic development
 
02:58:15.349 --> 02:58:15.359 align:start position:0%
there are very few regulations
 
02:58:18.170 --> 02:58:18.180 align:start position:0%
concerning boating operations on our New
 
02:58:20.450 --> 02:58:20.460 align:start position:0%
Hampshire lakes in comparison to other
 
02:58:22.570 --> 02:58:22.580 align:start position:0%
modes of recreation and transportation
 
02:58:25.070 --> 02:58:25.080 align:start position:0%
voting speed limits are just common
 
02:58:27.170 --> 02:58:27.180 align:start position:0%
sense for safety Recreation for all
 
02:58:28.849 --> 02:58:28.859 align:start position:0%
types of drivers
 
02:58:31.790 --> 02:58:31.800 align:start position:0%
the Lakes region is a driver for our
 
02:58:34.730 --> 02:58:34.740 align:start position:0%
state's economy in large part due to
 
02:58:36.410 --> 02:58:36.420 align:start position:0%
Lake Winnipesaukee
 
02:58:40.849 --> 02:58:40.859 align:start position:0%
please itl this very selfish request of
 
02:58:43.130 --> 02:58:43.140 align:start position:0%
a very few presented for their personal
 
02:58:46.250 --> 02:58:46.260 align:start position:0%
Thrills at the safety risk of all other
 
02:58:46.260 --> 02:58:47.750 align:start position:0%
Thrills at the safety risk of all other
boaters

02:58:47.750 --> 02:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
boaters
 
02:58:51.050 --> 02:58:51.060 align:start position:0%
the current law of 4530 was a negotiated
 
02:58:53.510 --> 02:58:53.520 align:start position:0%
law and at that time there was much
 
02:58:56.450 --> 02:58:56.460 align:start position:0%
discussion concerning the broads this is
 
02:58:58.370 --> 02:58:58.380 align:start position:0%
a major part of the lake and it is like
 
02:59:01.370 --> 02:59:01.380 align:start position:0%
a major intersection that so many boats
 
02:59:04.010 --> 02:59:04.020 align:start position:0%
of different sizes need to cross to get
 
02:59:06.889 --> 02:59:06.899 align:start position:0%
to Major ports or residential areas on
 
02:59:09.110 --> 02:59:09.120 align:start position:0%
the lake for simple enjoyment
 
02:59:10.670 --> 02:59:10.680 align:start position:0%
please honor the work of your
 
02:59:13.550 --> 02:59:13.560 align:start position:0%
predecessors in the House and Senate and
 
02:59:15.469 --> 02:59:15.479 align:start position:0%
do not modify this simple to understand
 
02:59:17.690 --> 02:59:17.700 align:start position:0%
safety regulation
 
02:59:20.630 --> 02:59:20.640 align:start position:0%
this is the 14th hearing
 
02:59:23.630 --> 02:59:23.640 align:start position:0%
on this simple Common Sense regulation
 
02:59:26.150 --> 02:59:26.160 align:start position:0%
enough is enough
 
02:59:28.550 --> 02:59:28.560 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor of this bill presented
 
02:59:30.769 --> 02:59:30.779 align:start position:0%
the same concept last year at the same
 
02:59:30.779 --> 02:59:31.730 align:start position:0%
the same concept last year at the same
time

02:59:31.730 --> 02:59:31.740 align:start position:0%
time
 
02:59:33.889 --> 02:59:33.899 align:start position:0%
the transportation committee voted to
 
02:59:35.389 --> 02:59:35.399 align:start position:0%
itl this bill
 
02:59:37.429 --> 02:59:37.439 align:start position:0%
here they are again before another
 
02:59:37.439 --> 02:59:38.690 align:start position:0%
here they are again before another
committee

02:59:38.690 --> 02:59:38.700 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:59:41.510 --> 02:59:41.520 align:start position:0%
last year the brides were presented and
 
02:59:43.490 --> 02:59:43.500 align:start position:0%
the lake were presented as large as the
 
02:59:46.670 --> 02:59:46.680 align:start position:0%
Manchester airport by the prime sponsor
 
02:59:49.250 --> 02:59:49.260 align:start position:0%
this really supports the need for
 
02:59:51.469 --> 02:59:51.479 align:start position:0%
recreation boating speed limits for all
 
02:59:52.849 --> 02:59:52.859 align:start position:0%
types of boats
 
02:59:55.070 --> 02:59:55.080 align:start position:0%
the airport is very controlled as you
 
02:59:56.570 --> 02:59:56.580 align:start position:0%
are all well aware
 
02:59:58.969 --> 02:59:58.979 align:start position:0%
nothing moves without a pilot or ground
 
03:00:01.250 --> 03:00:01.260 align:start position:0%
air controllers there are very few
 
03:00:03.650 --> 03:00:03.660 align:start position:0%
marked runs they are very well marked
 
03:00:06.530 --> 03:00:06.540 align:start position:0%
runways very limited access to the field
 
03:00:09.769 --> 03:00:09.779 align:start position:0%
I could go on and on the brides on Lake
 
03:00:12.230 --> 03:00:12.240 align:start position:0%
Winnipesaukee have none of these and
 
03:00:14.330 --> 03:00:14.340 align:start position:0%
boating operators range from the very
 
03:00:17.450 --> 03:00:17.460 align:start position:0%
young to the very old very experienced
 
03:00:19.190 --> 03:00:19.200 align:start position:0%
to the very new
 
03:00:21.769 --> 03:00:21.779 align:start position:0%
the lake is for New Hampshire residents
 
03:00:25.130 --> 03:00:25.140 align:start position:0%
and recreational guests not a racetrack
 
03:00:26.450 --> 03:00:26.460 align:start position:0%
for a few
 
03:00:29.809 --> 03:00:29.819 align:start position:0%
the ocean is near and wide open let them
 
03:00:32.210 --> 03:00:32.220 align:start position:0%
race there thank you very much
 
03:00:35.210 --> 03:00:35.220 align:start position:0%
any questions for the speaker
 
03:00:37.250 --> 03:00:37.260 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much for your
 
03:00:37.260 --> 03:00:39.349 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much for your
testimony

03:00:39.349 --> 03:00:39.359 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
03:00:50.050 --> 03:00:50.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:54.050 --> 03:00:54.060 align:start position:0%
Mr hello I'm Jay Newton I and I'm here
 
03:00:56.870 --> 03:00:56.880 align:start position:0%
representing myself and Mel Ingles who
 
03:00:58.130 --> 03:00:58.140 align:start position:0%
could not be here
 
03:01:01.910 --> 03:01:01.920 align:start position:0%
we both are Guilford residents I and
 
03:01:05.030 --> 03:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
we're both in opposition to HB 448
 
03:01:08.450 --> 03:01:08.460 align:start position:0%
we both live on the lake he lives there
 
03:01:11.330 --> 03:01:11.340 align:start position:0%
all all year long and I live there in
 
03:01:13.250 --> 03:01:13.260 align:start position:0%
the summer on Welch Island which is
 
03:01:16.010 --> 03:01:16.020 align:start position:0%
adjacent to this the area they want to
 
03:01:17.690 --> 03:01:17.700 align:start position:0%
increase the speed on
 
03:01:20.030 --> 03:01:20.040 align:start position:0%
and I just have to diverge in my so
 
03:01:21.590 --> 03:01:21.600 align:start position:0%
first of all don't be worried about my
 
03:01:23.750 --> 03:01:23.760 align:start position:0%
large packet here I'm only covering the
 
03:01:26.150 --> 03:01:26.160 align:start position:0%
first page the next four pages are
 
03:01:28.190 --> 03:01:28.200 align:start position:0%
something about a safe system approach
 
03:01:30.769 --> 03:01:30.779 align:start position:0%
and the last five are about Mel's
 
03:01:34.190 --> 03:01:34.200 align:start position:0%
accident he has he is on the lake every
 
03:01:37.070 --> 03:01:37.080 align:start position:0%
day when there isn't any ice he kayaks
 
03:01:39.650 --> 03:01:39.660 align:start position:0%
from his home out into the broads
 
03:01:42.410 --> 03:01:42.420 align:start position:0%
through the islands and back every day
 
03:01:44.870 --> 03:01:44.880 align:start position:0%
and so he has a lot of familiarity with
 
03:01:46.610 --> 03:01:46.620 align:start position:0%
that and he had the unfortunate
 
03:01:50.330 --> 03:01:50.340 align:start position:0%
experience in September of 2020 of being
 
03:01:52.250 --> 03:01:52.260 align:start position:0%
run over by a boat that was racing
 
03:01:53.510 --> 03:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
another boat
 
03:01:56.450 --> 03:01:56.460 align:start position:0%
so he has definite information about how
 
03:01:58.429 --> 03:01:58.439 align:start position:0%
speed affects people's decisions how
 
03:02:00.710 --> 03:02:00.720 align:start position:0%
people make mistakes and it can cause
 
03:02:03.010 --> 03:02:03.020 align:start position:0%
big problems on the lake so very quickly
 
03:02:07.670 --> 03:02:07.680 align:start position:0%
safety is Paramount in a recreation area
 
03:02:10.550 --> 03:02:10.560 align:start position:0%
the broads are like a park my wife and I
 
03:02:13.730 --> 03:02:13.740 align:start position:0%
look out and Mel sees this every day
 
03:02:16.130 --> 03:02:16.140 align:start position:0%
it's just people either floating in
 
03:02:18.530 --> 03:02:18.540 align:start position:0%
their boats sunbathing with kids all
 
03:02:21.110 --> 03:02:21.120 align:start position:0%
around swimming pulling kids on a tube
 
03:02:23.410 --> 03:02:23.420 align:start position:0%
paddle boarders windsurfers canoers
 
03:02:26.870 --> 03:02:26.880 align:start position:0%
Sailors Fisher people fishing it's it's
 
03:02:28.730 --> 03:02:28.740 align:start position:0%
just a nice place to hang out it's like
 
03:02:30.530 --> 03:02:30.540 align:start position:0%
a park in the middle of a busy City
 
03:02:32.870 --> 03:02:32.880 align:start position:0%
because the rest of the lake with three
 
03:02:35.330 --> 03:02:35.340 align:start position:0%
with 30 000 temporary licenses in
 
03:02:37.550 --> 03:02:37.560 align:start position:0%
addition to all the all the standard
 
03:02:40.550 --> 03:02:40.560 align:start position:0%
permanent licenses that that we have is
 
03:02:43.550 --> 03:02:43.560 align:start position:0%
just crazy just a two mile trip I take
 
03:02:46.010 --> 03:02:46.020 align:start position:0%
from my dock on Welch Island to get to
 
03:02:49.070 --> 03:02:49.080 align:start position:0%
the mainland is can be harrowing you
 
03:02:50.630 --> 03:02:50.640 align:start position:0%
don't know when people are going to turn
 
03:02:52.610 --> 03:02:52.620 align:start position:0%
and come for come out you know come at
 
03:02:54.950 --> 03:02:54.960 align:start position:0%
you you look once at one minute
 
03:02:56.269 --> 03:02:56.279 align:start position:0%
everything looks good the next minute
 
03:02:58.309 --> 03:02:58.319 align:start position:0%
there are three boats coming and there's
 
03:03:00.110 --> 03:03:00.120 align:start position:0%
a kayak you have to avoid an assailable
 
03:03:01.490 --> 03:03:01.500 align:start position:0%
at this coming over this way that you
 
03:03:04.429 --> 03:03:04.439 align:start position:0%
have to avoid so basically it's a it's a
 
03:03:06.170 --> 03:03:06.180 align:start position:0%
place a little more room where people
 
03:03:08.030 --> 03:03:08.040 align:start position:0%
can enjoy themselves and feel safe offer
 
03:03:10.010 --> 03:03:10.020 align:start position:0%
so the other part of this is about
 
03:03:12.469 --> 03:03:12.479 align:start position:0%
safety and about how speed affects
 
03:03:15.290 --> 03:03:15.300 align:start position:0%
safety and I bring up the U.S Department
 
03:03:17.450 --> 03:03:17.460 align:start position:0%
of Transportation safe system approach
 
03:03:19.370 --> 03:03:19.380 align:start position:0%
it's something that's been working its
 
03:03:21.530 --> 03:03:21.540 align:start position:0%
way around the world and our DOT is
 
03:03:24.110 --> 03:03:24.120 align:start position:0%
finally adopting it and it basically has
 
03:03:26.570 --> 03:03:26.580 align:start position:0%
a few tenants and the most important of
 
03:03:29.210 --> 03:03:29.220 align:start position:0%
which is serious death and serious
 
03:03:31.910 --> 03:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
injury and death are unacceptable we
 
03:03:34.370 --> 03:03:34.380 align:start position:0%
used to I think accept some deaths we
 
03:03:35.870 --> 03:03:35.880 align:start position:0%
knew that if we raise the speed limit it
 
03:03:37.190 --> 03:03:37.200 align:start position:0%
would increase the number of deaths on
 
03:03:39.769 --> 03:03:39.779 align:start position:0%
the road it was a known fact and yet we
 
03:03:41.330 --> 03:03:41.340 align:start position:0%
thought well for Commerce we've got to
 
03:03:43.070 --> 03:03:43.080 align:start position:0%
get people to their jobs we got to get
 
03:03:44.809 --> 03:03:44.819 align:start position:0%
goods and services delivered and so
 
03:03:48.349 --> 03:03:48.359 align:start position:0%
forth they're saying no no more so they
 
03:03:50.210 --> 03:03:50.220 align:start position:0%
have a multi-pronged approach which is
 
03:03:52.849 --> 03:03:52.859 align:start position:0%
detailed in the next five pages but
 
03:03:52.859 --> 03:03:54.230 align:start position:0%
detailed in the next five pages but
basically

03:03:54.230 --> 03:03:54.240 align:start position:0%
basically
 
03:03:56.510 --> 03:03:56.520 align:start position:0%
um the one one of the major tenants is
 
03:03:58.849 --> 03:03:58.859 align:start position:0%
that humans make mistakes we have
 
03:04:01.190 --> 03:04:01.200 align:start position:0%
wonderfully designed highways we have
 
03:04:04.610 --> 03:04:04.620 align:start position:0%
really safe cars now and yet in the last
 
03:04:06.889 --> 03:04:06.899 align:start position:0%
seven years we've gone from 30 000
 
03:04:09.950 --> 03:04:09.960 align:start position:0%
deaths caused by cars in in the United
 
03:04:12.230 --> 03:04:12.240 align:start position:0%
States to 40 000. that's a thirty
 
03:04:13.429 --> 03:04:13.439 align:start position:0%
percent increase
 
03:04:16.910 --> 03:04:16.920 align:start position:0%
and so a big part of that is speed and
 
03:04:18.650 --> 03:04:18.660 align:start position:0%
they say that speed kills and I have
 
03:04:20.929 --> 03:04:20.939 align:start position:0%
these little uh speed limit signs here
 
03:04:22.910 --> 03:04:22.920 align:start position:0%
so at 23 miles per hour if you get hit
 
03:04:27.230 --> 03:04:27.240 align:start position:0%
by a car you have 90 chance of not dying
 
03:04:30.590 --> 03:04:30.600 align:start position:0%
at 58 not even the 65 that they're
 
03:04:33.349 --> 03:04:33.359 align:start position:0%
advocating in this bill you have a 10
 
03:04:36.050 --> 03:04:36.060 align:start position:0%
chance of surviving
 
03:04:38.570 --> 03:04:38.580 align:start position:0%
and the um and I would say this
 
03:04:40.130 --> 03:04:40.140 align:start position:0%
translates pretty well to the water but
 
03:04:41.929 --> 03:04:41.939 align:start position:0%
it's even worse on the water if you
 
03:04:44.210 --> 03:04:44.220 align:start position:0%
consider the dangers of drowning if you
 
03:04:47.210 --> 03:04:47.220 align:start position:0%
get hit by a by a hit and run car and
 
03:04:48.830 --> 03:04:48.840 align:start position:0%
you're lying on the roadside there's
 
03:04:50.269 --> 03:04:50.279 align:start position:0%
probably a chance that somebody's going
 
03:04:51.710 --> 03:04:51.720 align:start position:0%
to come along and see you and maybe be
 
03:04:54.469 --> 03:04:54.479 align:start position:0%
able to save you if you're sinking in
 
03:04:55.429 --> 03:04:55.439 align:start position:0%
the water
 
03:04:56.990 --> 03:04:57.000 align:start position:0%
somebody might not even know that you
 
03:04:59.269 --> 03:04:59.279 align:start position:0%
even were hit and if even if they know
 
03:05:00.650 --> 03:05:00.660 align:start position:0%
you're there they might be looking for
 
03:05:02.510 --> 03:05:02.520 align:start position:0%
you and they might not see you on the
 
03:05:02.520 --> 03:05:03.710 align:start position:0%
you and they might not see you on the
bottom

03:05:03.710 --> 03:05:03.720 align:start position:0%
bottom
 
03:05:05.450 --> 03:05:05.460 align:start position:0%
so and then the other part is being
 
03:05:07.010 --> 03:05:07.020 align:start position:0%
injured by the boats for pillars which
 
03:05:09.349 --> 03:05:09.359 align:start position:0%
is what happened to Mel he was severely
 
03:05:11.630 --> 03:05:11.640 align:start position:0%
cut on his legs by the boat's propellers
 
03:05:14.929 --> 03:05:14.939 align:start position:0%
it had two Motors each motor has a
 
03:05:17.630 --> 03:05:17.640 align:start position:0%
propeller with four blades spinning at
 
03:05:20.510 --> 03:05:20.520 align:start position:0%
thousands of revolutions per minute and
 
03:05:22.550 --> 03:05:22.560 align:start position:0%
they cause him Serious injury that had
 
03:05:24.590 --> 03:05:24.600 align:start position:0%
him laid out for several months he's now
 
03:05:26.450 --> 03:05:26.460 align:start position:0%
back with a healthy lifestyle he does
 
03:05:28.130 --> 03:05:28.140 align:start position:0%
have some parts of his body that don't
 
03:05:30.349 --> 03:05:30.359 align:start position:0%
work the same as they used to we're
 
03:05:33.650 --> 03:05:33.660 align:start position:0%
happy he survived so the last thing is a
 
03:05:35.269 --> 03:05:35.279 align:start position:0%
quote or next to last is when you bring
 
03:05:37.130 --> 03:05:37.140 align:start position:0%
it to a conclusion Mr yeah the last
 
03:05:38.269 --> 03:05:38.279 align:start position:0%
thing the quote from the Insurance
 
03:05:40.670 --> 03:05:40.680 align:start position:0%
Institute for Highway Safety
 
03:05:43.130 --> 03:05:43.140 align:start position:0%
and if anybody knows how many people are
 
03:05:44.929 --> 03:05:44.939 align:start position:0%
being injured and died it's the
 
03:05:47.929 --> 03:05:47.939 align:start position:0%
insurance people so speed is unforgiving
 
03:05:50.870 --> 03:05:50.880 align:start position:0%
of human error making collisions both
 
03:05:52.130 --> 03:05:52.140 align:start position:0%
more likely
 
03:05:54.469 --> 03:05:54.479 align:start position:0%
to occur in more deadly
 
03:05:57.050 --> 03:05:57.060 align:start position:0%
so in some Nation I like to say a vote
 
03:06:00.590 --> 03:06:00.600 align:start position:0%
to oppose HB 448 is a vote for safety
 
03:06:02.630 --> 03:06:02.640 align:start position:0%
and to preserve the recreation area
 
03:06:04.130 --> 03:06:04.140 align:start position:0%
known as the broads on the
 
03:06:06.349 --> 03:06:06.359 align:start position:0%
quinnipesaukee thank you thank you any
 
03:06:08.870 --> 03:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
questions for Mr Newton
 
03:06:10.730 --> 03:06:10.740 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
03:06:14.090 --> 03:06:14.100 align:start position:0%
thank you up next Miss Adams and on Deck
 
03:06:14.100 --> 03:06:15.769 align:start position:0%
thank you up next Miss Adams and on Deck

hello my name is Abby Adams and I'm from
 
03:06:27.050 --> 03:06:27.060 align:start position:0%
I live in Wolfeboro New Hampshire and I
 
03:06:29.570 --> 03:06:29.580 align:start position:0%
oppose hb448
 
03:06:32.870 --> 03:06:32.880 align:start position:0%
I want to call attention to the 2021 U.S
 
03:06:34.550 --> 03:06:34.560 align:start position:0%
Coast Guard recreational voting
 
03:06:38.150 --> 03:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
statistics it lists the fall top five
 
03:06:41.090 --> 03:06:41.100 align:start position:0%
causes of accidents as operator in
 
03:06:43.690 --> 03:06:43.700 align:start position:0%
attention operator and experience
 
03:06:47.150 --> 03:06:47.160 align:start position:0%
improper Lookout Machinery failure and
 
03:06:48.950 --> 03:06:48.960 align:start position:0%
excessive speed
 
03:06:52.130 --> 03:06:52.140 align:start position:0%
alcohol actually comes in at six and yes
 
03:06:54.710 --> 03:06:54.720 align:start position:0%
while boating while intoxicated has been
 
03:06:56.269 --> 03:06:56.279 align:start position:0%
a persistent problem on Lake
 
03:06:56.279 --> 03:06:57.710 align:start position:0%
a persistent problem on Lake
Winnipesaukee

03:06:57.710 --> 03:06:57.720 align:start position:0%
Winnipesaukee
 
03:07:00.830 --> 03:07:00.840 align:start position:0%
but a boat that is speeding along at 65
 
03:07:03.889 --> 03:07:03.899 align:start position:0%
miles an hour with an impaired driver is
 
03:07:06.769 --> 03:07:06.779 align:start position:0%
far more likely to cause accidents and
 
03:07:09.050 --> 03:07:09.060 align:start position:0%
death than one who is obeying the speed
 
03:07:09.060 --> 03:07:09.950 align:start position:0%
death than one who is obeying the speed
limit

03:07:09.950 --> 03:07:09.960 align:start position:0%
limit
 
03:07:12.170 --> 03:07:12.180 align:start position:0%
a family boater trying to avoid a
 
03:07:14.330 --> 03:07:14.340 align:start position:0%
collision with an oncoming speeding boat
 
03:07:16.969 --> 03:07:16.979 align:start position:0%
has a better chance of avoiding an
 
03:07:19.670 --> 03:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
accident if the boat is traveling at 45
 
03:07:22.370 --> 03:07:22.380 align:start position:0%
miles per hour or less
 
03:07:25.790 --> 03:07:25.800 align:start position:0%
and now bass fishing fishing boats jet
 
03:07:28.250 --> 03:07:28.260 align:start position:0%
skis and even family boats have the
 
03:07:31.490 --> 03:07:31.500 align:start position:0%
capacity for going 50 60 80 even 100
 
03:07:33.769 --> 03:07:33.779 align:start position:0%
miles per hour
 
03:07:36.889 --> 03:07:36.899 align:start position:0%
you have heard examples of accidents
 
03:07:39.889 --> 03:07:39.899 align:start position:0%
which have occurred on Winnipesaukee
 
03:07:42.349 --> 03:07:42.359 align:start position:0%
and I'm enclosing one testimony from
 
03:07:45.370 --> 03:07:45.380 align:start position:0%
Captain Levy from the Marine Patrol
 
03:07:48.650 --> 03:07:48.660 align:start position:0%
as part of my testimony that involved a
 
03:07:48.660 --> 03:07:49.670 align:start position:0%
as part of my testimony that involved a
swimmer

03:07:49.670 --> 03:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
swimmer
 
03:07:52.610 --> 03:07:52.620 align:start position:0%
struck by a boat going over 65 miles an
 
03:07:52.620 --> 03:07:53.929 align:start position:0%
struck by a boat going over 65 miles an
hour

03:07:53.929 --> 03:07:53.939 align:start position:0%
hour
 
03:07:53.939 --> 03:07:55.269 align:start position:0%
hour
another

03:07:55.269 --> 03:07:55.279 align:start position:0%
another
 
03:07:57.889 --> 03:07:57.899 align:start position:0%
outlined in an email to the committee
 
03:08:02.210 --> 03:08:02.220 align:start position:0%
occurred in 2020 and involved a 32-foot
 
03:08:04.550 --> 03:08:04.560 align:start position:0%
speed boat which hit a kayaker at 35
 
03:08:06.349 --> 03:08:06.359 align:start position:0%
miles per hour
 
03:08:09.650 --> 03:08:09.660 align:start position:0%
said boat driver never even saw the
 
03:08:11.510 --> 03:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
kayaker and you have heard that the
 
03:08:13.969 --> 03:08:13.979 align:start position:0%
victim continues to suffer permanent
 
03:08:16.490 --> 03:08:16.500 align:start position:0%
permanent and ongoing injuries
 
03:08:19.250 --> 03:08:19.260 align:start position:0%
if the speedboat had been going 65 miles
 
03:08:21.950 --> 03:08:21.960 align:start position:0%
an hour this accident would undoubtedly
 
03:08:23.690 --> 03:08:23.700 align:start position:0%
have been fatal
 
03:08:27.290 --> 03:08:27.300 align:start position:0%
so please keep in mind that the number
 
03:08:29.210 --> 03:08:29.220 align:start position:0%
of people obtaining their boat license
 
03:08:33.469 --> 03:08:33.479 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire has increased from 6500
 
03:08:38.510 --> 03:08:38.520 align:start position:0%
in 2019 to over 30 000 in 2020.
 
03:08:41.690 --> 03:08:41.700 align:start position:0%
that's a 500 percent increase in new and
 
03:08:44.510 --> 03:08:44.520 align:start position:0%
inexperienced voters on our Lakes
 
03:08:46.849 --> 03:08:46.859 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire boat registrations have
 
03:08:52.250 --> 03:08:52.260 align:start position:0%
increased almost 15 percent since 2013.
 
03:08:55.370 --> 03:08:55.380 align:start position:0%
increasing speed even if quote just in
 
03:08:59.210 --> 03:08:59.220 align:start position:0%
the broads is unsafe given the sharp
 
03:09:02.210 --> 03:09:02.220 align:start position:0%
increase in boat registrations and the
 
03:09:02.220 --> 03:09:04.150 align:start position:0%
increase in boat registrations and the
significant

03:09:04.150 --> 03:09:04.160 align:start position:0%
significant
 
03:09:05.750 --> 03:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
understaffing of the New Hampshire

the proposal for increase in the speed

limit on Winnipesaukee from 45 miles an
 
03:10:53.870 --> 03:10:53.880 align:start position:0%
hour to 65 miles an hour

the conditions have not changed
 
03:11:02.809 --> 03:11:02.819 align:start position:0%
the proposed restricted area of the
 
03:11:04.910 --> 03:11:04.920 align:start position:0%
increased speed limit known as the
 
03:11:04.920 --> 03:11:06.349 align:start position:0%
increased speed limit known as the
broads

03:11:06.349 --> 03:11:06.359 align:start position:0%
broads
 
03:11:09.170 --> 03:11:09.180 align:start position:0%
in this bill is defined as the entire
 
03:11:11.510 --> 03:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
central part of the lake
 
03:11:13.309 --> 03:11:13.319 align:start position:0%
this means that all other craft
 
03:11:16.969 --> 03:11:16.979 align:start position:0%
including slower sailboats pontoon boats
 
03:11:19.849 --> 03:11:19.859 align:start position:0%
fishing boats and paddlecraft wishing to
 
03:11:23.210 --> 03:11:23.220 align:start position:0%
travel from one town or Bay to another
 
03:11:25.929 --> 03:11:25.939 align:start position:0%
must pass through an area of traffic
 
03:11:30.710 --> 03:11:30.720 align:start position:0%
traveling at automobile highway speeds
 
03:11:33.950 --> 03:11:33.960 align:start position:0%
picture a bicycle crossing a mile and a
 
03:11:37.190 --> 03:11:37.200 align:start position:0%
half wide I-93
 
03:11:40.070 --> 03:11:40.080 align:start position:0%
on a busy summer day the traffic on the
 
03:11:42.290 --> 03:11:42.300 align:start position:0%
broads is heavy and traveling in many
 
03:11:42.300 --> 03:11:43.490 align:start position:0%
broads is heavy and traveling in many
directions

03:11:43.490 --> 03:11:43.500 align:start position:0%
directions
 
03:11:46.490 --> 03:11:46.500 align:start position:0%
typical wave action on the broads can
 
03:11:49.190 --> 03:11:49.200 align:start position:0%
hide a small boat until dangerously
 
03:11:49.200 --> 03:11:50.870 align:start position:0%
hide a small boat until dangerously
close

03:11:50.870 --> 03:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
close
 
03:11:53.929 --> 03:11:53.939 align:start position:0%
besides the danger the majority of users
 
03:11:55.910 --> 03:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
of the lake would find their enjoyment
 
03:11:58.550 --> 03:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
curtailed for the pleasure of the few
 
03:12:01.130 --> 03:12:01.140 align:start position:0%
for those who wish to engage in
 
03:12:03.650 --> 03:12:03.660 align:start position:0%
high-speed racing on the lake
 
03:12:06.410 --> 03:12:06.420 align:start position:0%
special permits can be issued for
 
03:12:08.870 --> 03:12:08.880 align:start position:0%
sanctioned races with very lenient
 
03:12:10.730 --> 03:12:10.740 align:start position:0%
letting everybody come over the two
 
03:12:12.950 --> 03:12:12.960 align:start position:0%
minutes and now that we're on the second
 
03:12:15.830 --> 03:12:15.840 align:start position:0%
half of everyone to speak against if you
 
03:12:18.830 --> 03:12:18.840 align:start position:0%
can keep your remarks to the two minutes
 
03:12:20.750 --> 03:12:20.760 align:start position:0%
that would be appreciated especially if
 
03:12:23.150 --> 03:12:23.160 align:start position:0%
you have handouts which I will give the
 
03:12:25.849 --> 03:12:25.859 align:start position:0%
members time to read before we exec
 
03:12:28.010 --> 03:12:28.020 align:start position:0%
thank you you mean starting with the
 
03:12:30.070 --> 03:12:30.080 align:start position:0%
next speaker
 
03:12:33.290 --> 03:12:33.300 align:start position:0%
I'd like to point out that I drove down
 
03:12:36.050 --> 03:12:36.060 align:start position:0%
here at 60 miles an hour in a car that
 
03:12:38.809 --> 03:12:38.819 align:start position:0%
can probably go 120. that's just the way
 
03:12:41.210 --> 03:12:41.220 align:start position:0%
that's the way the world works
 
03:12:43.429 --> 03:12:43.439 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to speak to the proposed
 
03:12:46.610 --> 03:12:46.620 align:start position:0%
boundaries and also to enforceability of
 
03:12:49.790 --> 03:12:49.800 align:start position:0%
this act in the handout you have if
 
03:12:51.110 --> 03:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
could I ask you to look at the second
 
03:12:53.990 --> 03:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
page which has a chart of the lake on it
 
03:12:55.969 --> 03:12:55.979 align:start position:0%
and you can see in that chart that the
 
03:12:58.070 --> 03:12:58.080 align:start position:0%
sponsors have carved out a race course
 
03:13:01.190 --> 03:13:01.200 align:start position:0%
on the best part of our Lake and broadly
 
03:13:03.590 --> 03:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
speaking those boundaries are carelessly
 
03:13:06.349 --> 03:13:06.359 align:start position:0%
drawn and they're dangerous and it looks
 
03:13:08.210 --> 03:13:08.220 align:start position:0%
clean on paper but there are no yellow
 
03:13:10.490 --> 03:13:10.500 align:start position:0%
lines on the lake they'll be hard to
 
03:13:13.130 --> 03:13:13.140 align:start position:0%
enforce if not impossible impossible and
 
03:13:16.309 --> 03:13:16.319 align:start position:0%
hard for visiting boaters to observe
 
03:13:18.230 --> 03:13:18.240 align:start position:0%
if you look at the chart and start at
 
03:13:21.050 --> 03:13:21.060 align:start position:0%
the top left the the boundary actually
 
03:13:23.690 --> 03:13:23.700 align:start position:0%
crosses the middle of Sandy Island it
 
03:13:26.030 --> 03:13:26.040 align:start position:0%
almost touches tuft and brow neck and
 
03:13:28.030 --> 03:13:28.040 align:start position:0%
across his wolf burrow neck
 
03:13:31.630 --> 03:13:31.640 align:start position:0%
this invites boaters to skirt the shore
 
03:13:35.510 --> 03:13:35.520 align:start position:0%
and the legal distance of 150 feet is
 
03:13:37.730 --> 03:13:37.740 align:start position:0%
way too close to me traveling at 65
 
03:13:39.110 --> 03:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
miles an hour
 
03:13:41.690 --> 03:13:41.700 align:start position:0%
if you move down that Northern boundary
 
03:13:44.750 --> 03:13:44.760 align:start position:0%
of the line it passes Parker Island and
 
03:13:46.730 --> 03:13:46.740 align:start position:0%
there's a fairly narrow channel between
 
03:13:49.070 --> 03:13:49.080 align:start position:0%
Parker Island and the shore and that is
 
03:13:52.010 --> 03:13:52.020 align:start position:0%
cut in half by two black buoys and the
 
03:13:54.530 --> 03:13:54.540 align:start position:0%
remaining channel is definitely too
 
03:13:57.110 --> 03:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
narrow for travel at that speed
 
03:13:59.750 --> 03:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
if you go away to the lower right corner
 
03:14:02.809 --> 03:14:02.819 align:start position:0%
of your picture near buoy 78 the
 
03:14:05.690 --> 03:14:05.700 align:start position:0%
high-speed area encompasses moose Island
 
03:14:08.870 --> 03:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
Ship Island a bunch of rocks and shallow
 
03:14:14.030 --> 03:14:14.040 align:start position:0%
area and six navigational buoys that's
 
03:14:16.429 --> 03:14:16.439 align:start position:0%
probably not what you would expect in a
 
03:14:17.990 --> 03:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
high-speed Zone
 
03:14:20.690 --> 03:14:20.700 align:start position:0%
the further the bill says that the
 
03:14:22.070 --> 03:14:22.080 align:start position:0%
course should pass outside of
 
03:14:23.990 --> 03:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
Rattlesnake Island and you'll see in the
 
03:14:25.849 --> 03:14:25.859 align:start position:0%
chart I question that which way is
 
03:14:25.859 --> 03:14:26.750 align:start position:0%
chart I question that which way is
outside

03:14:26.750 --> 03:14:26.760 align:start position:0%
outside
 
03:14:29.929 --> 03:14:29.939 align:start position:0%
we may think we know but I believe it's
 
03:14:32.269 --> 03:14:32.279 align:start position:0%
ambiguous it depends on on your
 
03:14:34.190 --> 03:14:34.200 align:start position:0%
reference point it'll certainly be
 
03:14:36.349 --> 03:14:36.359 align:start position:0%
ambiguous to a visitor
 
03:14:36.359 --> 03:14:38.990 align:start position:0%
ambiguous to a visitor
the

03:14:38.990 --> 03:14:39.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:14:40.670 --> 03:14:40.680 align:start position:0%
is that for me
 
03:14:43.330 --> 03:14:43.340 align:start position:0%
that might be a good hint
 
03:14:46.730 --> 03:14:46.740 align:start position:0%
the next page shows what's informally
 
03:14:49.010 --> 03:14:49.020 align:start position:0%
called the upper broads and that is a
 
03:14:50.570 --> 03:14:50.580 align:start position:0%
wide open space it's not within this
 
03:14:52.670 --> 03:14:52.680 align:start position:0%
boundary but I find it very hard to
 
03:14:56.090 --> 03:14:56.100 align:start position:0%
imagine that um voters who are enjoying
 
03:14:58.070 --> 03:14:58.080 align:start position:0%
these high speeds will stop in the
 
03:14:59.870 --> 03:14:59.880 align:start position:0%
boundaries they'll they'll Zoom all the
 
03:15:01.910 --> 03:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
way up through the upper broads
 
03:15:05.090 --> 03:15:05.100 align:start position:0%
and the last thing I want to say is what
 
03:15:07.309 --> 03:15:07.319 align:start position:0%
what about 60 miles 65 miles an hour
 
03:15:10.550 --> 03:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
last year the bill was for unlimited
 
03:15:12.650 --> 03:15:12.660 align:start position:0%
speeds and they've kind of softened it
 
03:15:15.230 --> 03:15:15.240 align:start position:0%
this year to 65. and to me that's a joke
 
03:15:17.750 --> 03:15:17.760 align:start position:0%
maybe even an insult because who the
 
03:15:19.969 --> 03:15:19.979 align:start position:0%
heck can tell tell the difference uh
 
03:15:22.070 --> 03:15:22.080 align:start position:0%
Marine Patrol or any one of us whether
 
03:15:25.910 --> 03:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
somebody's going 65 or 80 or even 100 so
 
03:15:28.730 --> 03:15:28.740 align:start position:0%
in my view this bill is in Practical
 
03:15:31.250 --> 03:15:31.260 align:start position:0%
dangerous unenforceable
 
03:15:33.889 --> 03:15:33.899 align:start position:0%
and you all know what to do thank you
 
03:15:36.590 --> 03:15:36.600 align:start position:0%
questions uh for the speaker yes Mr
 
03:15:40.010 --> 03:15:40.020 align:start position:0%
McHugh representative McKee thank you
 
03:15:41.990 --> 03:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question yes sir
 
03:15:44.809 --> 03:15:44.819 align:start position:0%
is it Mr posnack yes sir would you
 
03:15:47.929 --> 03:15:47.939 align:start position:0%
believe that from the hundreds of emails
 
03:15:49.910 --> 03:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
in written testimony we got in
 
03:15:51.590 --> 03:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
opposition of this bill
 
03:15:54.230 --> 03:15:54.240 align:start position:0%
yours with the nautical charts was my
 
03:15:54.240 --> 03:15:55.250 align:start position:0%
yours with the nautical charts was my
favorite

03:15:55.250 --> 03:15:55.260 align:start position:0%
favorite
 
03:15:56.710 --> 03:15:56.720 align:start position:0%
oh good
 
03:15:59.809 --> 03:15:59.819 align:start position:0%
good reading thank you for pointing out
 
03:16:01.849 --> 03:16:01.859 align:start position:0%
that some of the references went
 
03:16:03.830 --> 03:16:03.840 align:start position:0%
straight through
 
03:16:06.650 --> 03:16:06.660 align:start position:0%
a land mass so I enjoyed reading this
 
03:16:08.030 --> 03:16:08.040 align:start position:0%
the other night when I got it well
 
03:16:09.830 --> 03:16:09.840 align:start position:0%
hopefully these voters will choose not
 
03:16:12.110 --> 03:16:12.120 align:start position:0%
to travel across the land mass but the
 
03:16:13.429 --> 03:16:13.439 align:start position:0%
suggestion is that they're supposed to
 
03:16:15.530 --> 03:16:15.540 align:start position:0%
drive very close to it when I got the
 
03:16:17.090 --> 03:16:17.100 align:start position:0%
chart it was speaking my language so
 
03:16:18.349 --> 03:16:18.359 align:start position:0%
thank you for sending that you're very
 
03:16:20.450 --> 03:16:20.460 align:start position:0%

03:16:22.910 --> 03:16:22.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony up next Mr
 
03:16:26.150 --> 03:16:26.160 align:start position:0%
Hennessy on Deck Mr Keeler

Hennessey and um
 
03:16:34.849 --> 03:16:34.859 align:start position:0%
last week you all received documentation
 
03:16:37.130 --> 03:16:37.140 align:start position:0%
of a serious serious accident on
 
03:16:39.950 --> 03:16:39.960 align:start position:0%
Winnipesaukee in 2020 dealing how a
 
03:16:42.170 --> 03:16:42.180 align:start position:0%
speed boat going 35 miles an hour never
 
03:16:44.690 --> 03:16:44.700 align:start position:0%
even saw a kayaker the victim's life is
 
03:16:46.969 --> 03:16:46.979 align:start position:0%
forever changed but I want to quickly
 
03:16:49.309 --> 03:16:49.319 align:start position:0%
discuss two other reasons why this bill
 
03:16:52.429 --> 03:16:52.439 align:start position:0%
should be voted Ito number one our local
 
03:16:52.439 --> 03:16:53.750 align:start position:0%
should be voted Ito number one our local
economy

03:16:53.750 --> 03:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
economy
 
03:16:55.849 --> 03:16:55.859 align:start position:0%
prior to the passage of the speed limit
 
03:16:57.710 --> 03:16:57.720 align:start position:0%
Winnipesaukee had suffered from a
 
03:17:00.170 --> 03:17:00.180 align:start position:0%
reputation as being a cowboy Wild West
 
03:17:02.450 --> 03:17:02.460 align:start position:0%
destination several fatal and high
 
03:17:05.389 --> 03:17:05.399 align:start position:0%
profile accidents involving high-powered
 
03:17:07.190 --> 03:17:07.200 align:start position:0%
speed boats had contributed to this
 
03:17:09.769 --> 03:17:09.779 align:start position:0%
reputation and this is why over 300
 
03:17:11.929 --> 03:17:11.939 align:start position:0%
businesses signed in to support the
 
03:17:14.990 --> 03:17:15.000 align:start position:0%
speed limit law we worked very hard over
 
03:17:17.510 --> 03:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
10 years ago to adopt speed limits on
 
03:17:20.150 --> 03:17:20.160 align:start position:0%
the lake and contest and can a test they
 
03:17:22.429 --> 03:17:22.439 align:start position:0%
have made a remarkable remarkable
 
03:17:24.590 --> 03:17:24.600 align:start position:0%
difference on the improved atmosphere of
 
03:17:26.510 --> 03:17:26.520 align:start position:0%
tranquility and safety for all who
 
03:17:28.370 --> 03:17:28.380 align:start position:0%
recreate there
 
03:17:30.710 --> 03:17:30.720 align:start position:0%

the Lake Winnipesaukee Association
 
03:17:38.450 --> 03:17:38.460 align:start position:0%
showed that the lake generates over 17
 
03:17:40.929 --> 03:17:40.939 align:start position:0%
billion dollars for the region and state
 
03:17:43.670 --> 03:17:43.680 align:start position:0%

03:17:48.070 --> 03:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
its special beautiful
 
03:17:51.349 --> 03:17:51.359 align:start position:0%
Recreation they feel safer boating as do
 
03:17:53.210 --> 03:17:53.220 align:start position:0%
we with the current speed limits why
 
03:17:55.429 --> 03:17:55.439 align:start position:0%
polish the speed limits for a select few
 
03:17:58.550 --> 03:17:58.560 align:start position:0%
at the expense of the majority
 
03:18:01.630 --> 03:18:01.640 align:start position:0%
we have many associations and businesses
 
03:18:04.670 --> 03:18:04.680 align:start position:0%
that support our current speed limit

would a marina
 
03:18:27.050 --> 03:18:27.060 align:start position:0%
be against HB 448 they cater to family
 
03:18:28.730 --> 03:18:28.740 align:start position:0%
voters and that's where they're making
 
03:18:30.110 --> 03:18:30.120 align:start position:0%
their money
 
03:18:33.349 --> 03:18:33.359 align:start position:0%
finally I want to point out that the
 
03:18:35.410 --> 03:18:35.420 align:start position:0%
public supports our present speed limit
 
03:18:38.990 --> 03:18:39.000 align:start position:0%
on May 5th 2010 the New Hampshire house
 
03:18:43.070 --> 03:18:43.080 align:start position:0%
voted 268 to 79 on a roll call vote in
 
03:18:45.429 --> 03:18:45.439 align:start position:0%
favor of the bill
 
03:18:50.030 --> 03:18:50.040 align:start position:0%
in 2011 a Magellan poll was completed
 
03:18:52.790 --> 03:18:52.800 align:start position:0%
showing 70 percent of those surveyed in
 
03:18:56.990 --> 03:18:57.000 align:start position:0%
favor of the 45-30 law and 69 against 55
 
03:18:59.590 --> 03:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
in the broads
 
03:19:04.130 --> 03:19:04.140 align:start position:0%
on May 18 2011 the Full House of
 
03:19:06.710 --> 03:19:06.720 align:start position:0%
Representatives voted to uphold the
 
03:19:08.290 --> 03:19:08.300 align:start position:0%
speed limit
 
03:19:12.769 --> 03:19:12.779 align:start position:0%
276 years to 75 Nays 45 not voting only
 
03:19:15.650 --> 03:19:15.660 align:start position:0%
three out of the 20 reps from towns
 
03:19:17.830 --> 03:19:17.840 align:start position:0%

03:19:24.170 --> 03:19:24.180 align:start position:0%
and of course last year another bill
 
03:19:26.090 --> 03:19:26.100 align:start position:0%
which would have increased the speed
 
03:19:28.370 --> 03:19:28.380 align:start position:0%
limit on Winnipesaukee was voted down by
 
03:19:31.309 --> 03:19:31.319 align:start position:0%
the transportation committee by a 17-3
 
03:19:36.230 --> 03:19:36.240 align:start position:0%

03:20:07.849 --> 03:20:07.859 align:start position:0%
the lake unless it's an emergency it is
 
03:20:09.769 --> 03:20:09.779 align:start position:0%
such a zoo out there other boats going
 
03:20:12.530 --> 03:20:12.540 align:start position:0%
every different direction and as
 
03:20:15.170 --> 03:20:15.180 align:start position:0%
testified by other people before in
 
03:20:16.969 --> 03:20:16.979 align:start position:0%

03:20:25.730 --> 03:20:25.740 align:start position:0%
four football fields I could bore you

with all the details and the safety
 
03:20:30.170 --> 03:20:30.180 align:start position:0%
issues but the truth of the matter is
 
03:20:32.210 --> 03:20:32.220 align:start position:0%
this is a bill that's about the wants of
 
03:20:35.090 --> 03:20:35.100 align:start position:0%
a few versus the needs of all and that
 
03:20:37.910 --> 03:20:37.920 align:start position:0%
the needs to be safe as I believe that
 
03:20:39.469 --> 03:20:39.479 align:start position:0%
the committee is going to make the
 
03:20:41.570 --> 03:20:41.580 align:start position:0%
decision based on common sense and
 
03:20:43.910 --> 03:20:43.920 align:start position:0%

448. my family votes through the broads
regularly

03:21:22.849 --> 03:21:22.859 align:start position:0%
regularly
 
03:21:25.610 --> 03:21:25.620 align:start position:0%
when we boat to Wolfeboro tufenborough
 
03:21:28.550 --> 03:21:28.560 align:start position:0%
Alton Bay or down to Center Harbor for
 
03:21:30.230 --> 03:21:30.240 align:start position:0%
dinner or shopping
 
03:21:33.410 --> 03:21:33.420 align:start position:0%
thousands of other Islanders do the same
 
03:21:36.230 --> 03:21:36.240 align:start position:0%
as a physician involved with trauma care
 
03:21:38.210 --> 03:21:38.220 align:start position:0%
my whole career
 
03:21:41.750 --> 03:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
I can attest to the dangerous high-speed
 
03:21:44.090 --> 03:21:44.100 align:start position:0%
injuries on our Lake on our state's
 
03:21:46.849 --> 03:21:46.859 align:start position:0%
highways injuries to boating accidents
 
03:21:49.250 --> 03:21:49.260 align:start position:0%
are no different except that they may
 
03:21:51.530 --> 03:21:51.540 align:start position:0%
also involve
 
03:21:54.830 --> 03:21:54.840 align:start position:0%
drowning high-speed boaters causing
 
03:21:57.710 --> 03:21:57.720 align:start position:0%
injury and even death to slower speed
 
03:22:01.610 --> 03:22:01.620 align:start position:0%
Sailors water skiers tubers paddlers and
 
03:22:04.630 --> 03:22:04.640 align:start position:0%
swimmers are like cars striking
 
03:22:07.250 --> 03:22:07.260 align:start position:0%
motorcyclists bicyclists and pedestrians
 
03:22:10.309 --> 03:22:10.319 align:start position:0%
I've seen these critical injuries and
 
03:22:12.650 --> 03:22:12.660 align:start position:0%
treated their grave problems and
 
03:22:15.650 --> 03:22:15.660 align:start position:0%
counseled their grieving families
 
03:22:18.230 --> 03:22:18.240 align:start position:0%
due to these horrified horrifying
 
03:22:21.830 --> 03:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
accidents fortunately we have not seen
 
03:22:23.690 --> 03:22:23.700 align:start position:0%
these high-speed accidents on Lake
 
03:22:26.690 --> 03:22:26.700 align:start position:0%
Winnipesaukee for many years because of
 
03:22:29.929 --> 03:22:29.939 align:start position:0%
the 45-30 miles per hour law
 
03:22:34.190 --> 03:22:34.200 align:start position:0%
it's been working fine since 2009.
 
03:22:36.050 --> 03:22:36.060 align:start position:0%
the lake has been safer and more
 
03:22:38.870 --> 03:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
pleasurable over the last 14 years
 
03:22:41.450 --> 03:22:41.460 align:start position:0%
my family's boating back and forth from
 
03:22:43.969 --> 03:22:43.979 align:start position:0%
our Island Camp to the mainland has
 
03:22:46.070 --> 03:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
become much more comfortable with less
 
03:22:46.080 --> 03:22:47.450 align:start position:0%
become much more comfortable with less
anxiety

03:22:47.450 --> 03:22:47.460 align:start position:0%
anxiety
 
03:22:50.630 --> 03:22:50.640 align:start position:0%
than it was before the law each time we
 
03:22:52.550 --> 03:22:52.560 align:start position:0%
cross the channel before these speed
 
03:22:55.250 --> 03:22:55.260 align:start position:0%

03:22:55.260 --> 03:22:56.389 align:start position:0%

03:23:06.230 --> 03:23:06.240 align:start position:0%
Boating wasn't fun it was incredibly
 
03:23:06.240 --> 03:23:07.969 align:start position:0%
Boating wasn't fun it was incredibly
stressful

03:23:07.969 --> 03:23:07.979 align:start position:0%

03:23:10.010 --> 03:23:10.020 align:start position:0%
please do not take us back to those
 
03:23:10.020 --> 03:23:11.210 align:start position:0%
please do not take us back to those
times

03:23:11.210 --> 03:23:11.220 align:start position:0%
times

as a Lakes region in a businessman and

03:24:02.450 --> 03:24:02.460 align:start position:0%
allowed boat speed could negatively
 
03:24:04.790 --> 03:24:04.800 align:start position:0%

it's back
 
03:24:16.070 --> 03:24:16.080 align:start position:0%

to boats from town to town generally
 
03:24:53.809 --> 03:24:53.819 align:start position:0%
means Crossing through the broads
 
03:24:57.229 --> 03:24:57.239 align:start position:0%
the largest open section of the lake
 
03:24:59.210 --> 03:24:59.220 align:start position:0%
but this is also where the high-speeding
 
03:25:01.610 --> 03:25:01.620 align:start position:0%
boats will be
 
03:25:03.710 --> 03:25:03.720 align:start position:0%
if the speed increase is allowed this
 
03:25:05.510 --> 03:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
could dramatically impact Boater's
 
03:25:05.520 --> 03:25:07.010 align:start position:0%
could dramatically impact Boater's

03:25:07.010 --> 03:25:07.020 align:start position:0%
safety
 
03:25:09.650 --> 03:25:09.660 align:start position:0%
for boaters crossing the lake
 
03:25:11.870 --> 03:25:11.880 align:start position:0%
and crossing the broads this would be
 
03:25:14.510 --> 03:25:14.520 align:start position:0%
like trying to cross a highway
 
03:25:16.610 --> 03:25:16.620 align:start position:0%
likewise this could change the volume of
 
03:25:18.950 --> 03:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
family boaters using the lake and
 
03:25:21.650 --> 03:25:21.660 align:start position:0%
frequenting the businesses
 
03:25:23.090 --> 03:25:23.100 align:start position:0%
I have been a realtor in The Lakes
 
03:25:25.370 --> 03:25:25.380 align:start position:0%

boaters
 
03:25:31.190 --> 03:25:31.200 align:start position:0%
and not once has anyone ever questioned
 
03:25:34.729 --> 03:25:34.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:36.830 --> 03:25:36.840 align:start position:0%
I am a boater and I know from experience
 
03:25:38.030 --> 03:25:38.040 align:start position:0%
what it's like
 
03:25:40.550 --> 03:25:40.560 align:start position:0%
years ago being in Maine in boating in
 
03:25:43.070 --> 03:25:43.080 align:start position:0%
an area of high-speed boats
 
03:25:45.710 --> 03:25:45.720 align:start position:0%
it wasn't fun
 
03:25:47.870 --> 03:25:47.880 align:start position:0%
and for those who Sail
 
03:25:51.050 --> 03:25:51.060 align:start position:0%
at Lake Winnipesaukee the broads is the
 
03:25:52.250 --> 03:25:52.260 align:start position:0%
place to be
 
03:25:54.830 --> 03:25:54.840 align:start position:0%
it's wide open however putting
 
03:25:57.950 --> 03:25:57.960 align:start position:0%
high-speed boats and sailboats in the
 
03:26:00.290 --> 03:26:00.300 align:start position:0%
broads at the same time is a very
 
03:26:02.210 --> 03:26:02.220 align:start position:0%
dangerous mix
 
03:26:04.910 --> 03:26:04.920 align:start position:0%
I have a question for you folks raising
 
03:26:06.889 --> 03:26:06.899 align:start position:0%
your hands how many have been in a boat
 
03:26:10.910 --> 03:26:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:13.490 --> 03:26:13.500 align:start position:0%
okay very good very good well let me
 
03:26:15.050 --> 03:26:15.060 align:start position:0%
tell you it's not like driving a car at
 
03:26:17.030 --> 03:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
30 miles an hour there's no top
 
03:26:18.950 --> 03:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
generally and you're right near the
 
03:26:20.510 --> 03:26:20.520 align:start position:0%
water which would be technically the
 
03:26:21.889 --> 03:26:21.899 align:start position:0%
pavement of the car
 
03:26:24.410 --> 03:26:24.420 align:start position:0%
it is very fast
 
03:26:27.290 --> 03:26:27.300 align:start position:0%
30 is fast my kids and they're in their
 
03:26:29.809 --> 03:26:29.819 align:start position:0%
20s and 30s they think it's fast when
 
03:26:32.269 --> 03:26:32.279 align:start position:0%
we're out and Michael so just also keep
 
03:26:33.590 --> 03:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
that in mind and thank you for your
 
03:26:36.769 --> 03:26:36.779 align:start position:0%
consideration thank you any questions I
 
03:26:38.210 --> 03:26:38.220 align:start position:0%
don't see any questions thank you for
 
03:26:39.950 --> 03:26:39.960 align:start position:0%
your testimony
 
03:26:46.790 --> 03:26:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:50.030 --> 03:26:50.040 align:start position:0%
Rocky and strongly oppose House Bill 448
 
03:26:52.790 --> 03:26:52.800 align:start position:0%
like thousands of other Islanders my
 
03:26:54.349 --> 03:26:54.359 align:start position:0%
family has to use boating as
 
03:26:56.630 --> 03:26:56.640 align:start position:0%
transportation to and from our Island
 
03:26:59.150 --> 03:26:59.160 align:start position:0%
Cottage we use our boats to pick up
 
03:27:01.670 --> 03:27:01.680 align:start position:0%
guests and family to shop for groceries
 
03:27:04.309 --> 03:27:04.319 align:start position:0%
to eat out at restaurants to carry
 
03:27:06.889 --> 03:27:06.899 align:start position:0%
garbage or recyclables and to do a host
 
03:27:08.809 --> 03:27:08.819 align:start position:0%
of other errands often through the
 
03:27:08.819 --> 03:27:10.370 align:start position:0%
of other errands often through the
broads

03:27:10.370 --> 03:27:10.380 align:start position:0%
broads
 
03:27:12.349 --> 03:27:12.359 align:start position:0%
what have we learned
 
03:27:14.330 --> 03:27:14.340 align:start position:0%
what have I learned along with many
 
03:27:17.450 --> 03:27:17.460 align:start position:0%
others over the last 14 years of about
 
03:27:20.809 --> 03:27:20.819 align:start position:0%
high-speed boating and the 45-30 voting
 
03:27:22.190 --> 03:27:22.200 align:start position:0%
speed limits law
 
03:27:24.889 --> 03:27:24.899 align:start position:0%
first the American Red Cross and the U.S
 
03:27:27.050 --> 03:27:27.060 align:start position:0%
Coast Guard have taught us about odor
 
03:27:29.750 --> 03:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
fatigue from an operator's strained
 
03:27:32.510 --> 03:27:32.520 align:start position:0%
visibility due to Sun reflecting on
 
03:27:34.969 --> 03:27:34.979 align:start position:0%
Waters bouncing around on turbulent
 
03:27:38.570 --> 03:27:38.580 align:start position:0%
waves motor vibration and noise adding
 
03:27:41.090 --> 03:27:41.100 align:start position:0%
reaction time and reducing a boat

operator's ability to avoid an accident
 
03:27:46.969 --> 03:27:46.979 align:start position:0%
motor fatigue can triple the effects of
 
03:27:46.979 --> 03:27:48.110 align:start position:0%
motor fatigue can triple the effects of
alcohol

03:27:48.110 --> 03:27:48.120 align:start position:0%
alcohol
 
03:27:50.330 --> 03:27:50.340 align:start position:0%
the average New England boat operators
 
03:27:52.490 --> 03:27:52.500 align:start position:0%
tie behind the wheel is less than 35
 
03:27:56.510 --> 03:27:56.520 align:start position:0%
hours per year so he or she may be rusty
 
03:27:58.670 --> 03:27:58.680 align:start position:0%
oats don't have breaks or turn signals
 
03:28:00.590 --> 03:28:00.600 align:start position:0%
and passengers usually don't wear life
 
03:28:03.050 --> 03:28:03.060 align:start position:0%
jackets boat traffic goes in all
 
03:28:05.690 --> 03:28:05.700 align:start position:0%
directions and is unpredictable
 
03:28:08.210 --> 03:28:08.220 align:start position:0%
as a result many boaters are unprepared
 
03:28:11.030 --> 03:28:11.040 align:start position:0%
for the unexpected and poor decisions
 
03:28:13.429 --> 03:28:13.439 align:start position:0%
can quickly lead to tragic boating
 
03:28:13.439 --> 03:28:14.870 align:start position:0%
can quickly lead to tragic boating

accidents
 
03:28:16.849 --> 03:28:16.859 align:start position:0%
secondly we have learned from
 
03:28:18.710 --> 03:28:18.720 align:start position:0%
enforcement authorities at lakes around
 
03:28:20.450 --> 03:28:20.460 align:start position:0%
the U.S where there are voting speed
 
03:28:23.389 --> 03:28:23.399 align:start position:0%
limits that 95 percent of Voters abide
 
03:28:25.490 --> 03:28:25.500 align:start position:0%
by speed limits just by having the law
 
03:28:27.950 --> 03:28:27.960 align:start position:0%
on the books which is what we've
 
03:28:30.830 --> 03:28:30.840 align:start position:0%
experienced over the last 14 years the
 
03:28:33.410 --> 03:28:33.420 align:start position:0%
14 the 45-30 speed limits are
 
03:28:33.420 --> 03:28:35.090 align:start position:0%
14 the 45-30 speed limits are
self-enforcing

03:28:35.090 --> 03:28:35.100 align:start position:0%
self-enforcing
 
03:28:38.090 --> 03:28:38.100 align:start position:0%
they say that the speed limits based
 
03:28:40.429 --> 03:28:40.439 align:start position:0%

03:28:46.969 --> 03:28:46.979 align:start position:0%
as one enforcement person said speed is

years other than to increase power they
 
03:28:58.790 --> 03:28:58.800 align:start position:0%
lack any safety equipment like that's
 
03:29:02.389 --> 03:29:02.399 align:start position:0%
required in cars airbags padded dashes
 
03:29:05.510 --> 03:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
Etc so boaters have no protection
 
03:29:08.090 --> 03:29:08.100 align:start position:0%
for every fatality there are 20 injury
 
03:29:10.370 --> 03:29:10.380 align:start position:0%
accidents and most are head injuries
 
03:29:12.469 --> 03:29:12.479 align:start position:0%
that can result in drowning
 
03:29:14.809 --> 03:29:14.819 align:start position:0%
speed and recklessness are the most
 
03:29:16.670 --> 03:29:16.680 align:start position:0%
important factors

you
 
03:30:01.490 --> 03:30:01.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:05.389 --> 03:30:05.399 align:start position:0%
up next Nancy Watson on Deck Mark Watson
 
03:30:10.370 --> 03:30:10.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:13.429 --> 03:30:13.439 align:start position:0%
Nancy go ahead good afternoon
 
03:30:15.710 --> 03:30:15.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time today my name is
 
03:30:18.290 --> 03:30:18.300 align:start position:0%
Nancy Watson and I'm from Wilson Road
 
03:30:18.300 --> 03:30:19.910 align:start position:0%

neaton

03:30:19.910 --> 03:30:19.920 align:start position:0%
neaton
 
03:30:22.250 --> 03:30:22.260 align:start position:0%
well my 93 year old father likes to
 
03:30:24.710 --> 03:30:24.720 align:start position:0%
remind me that I'm no spring chicken
 
03:30:26.809 --> 03:30:26.819 align:start position:0%
and he may be right about that because
 
03:30:29.269 --> 03:30:29.279 align:start position:0%
this summer will mark my 36th year on
 
03:30:31.490 --> 03:30:31.500 align:start position:0%
Rattlesnake Island facing the broads on
 
03:30:33.950 --> 03:30:33.960 align:start position:0%
Lake Winnipesaukee like many people are
 
03:30:36.530 --> 03:30:36.540 align:start position:0%
here today this is also the third time
 
03:30:38.870 --> 03:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
in the last 14 years that I've traveled
 
03:30:41.030 --> 03:30:41.040 align:start position:0%
to Concord to support boat speed limits
 
03:30:43.250 --> 03:30:43.260 align:start position:0%
on the lake and I'm doing this because I
 
03:30:45.410 --> 03:30:45.420 align:start position:0%
know they work before the limits were
 
03:30:47.570 --> 03:30:47.580 align:start position:0%
enacted the boat traffic especially in
 
03:30:49.610 --> 03:30:49.620 align:start position:0%
the vicinity of the broads was chaotic
 
03:30:52.250 --> 03:30:52.260 align:start position:0%
on busy weekends large power boats
 
03:30:54.170 --> 03:30:54.180 align:start position:0%
frequently raced to each other or
 
03:30:57.110 --> 03:30:57.120 align:start position:0%
traveled in Pats at high speeds often
 
03:30:58.969 --> 03:30:58.979 align:start position:0%
weaving around other smaller boats and
 
03:31:01.010 --> 03:31:01.020 align:start position:0%
slower boats going in either direction
 
03:31:04.070 --> 03:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
as well as crisscrossing the lake and
 
03:31:07.010 --> 03:31:07.020 align:start position:0%
our camp has from the dock up to the
 
03:31:09.830 --> 03:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
cottage about 60 steps so you have a
 
03:31:11.030 --> 03:31:11.040 align:start position:0%
really good vantage point of looking
 
03:31:13.490 --> 03:31:13.500 align:start position:0%
down on the lake and in looking down on
 
03:31:16.130 --> 03:31:16.140 align:start position:0%
the lake it was intimidating just to
 
03:31:17.570 --> 03:31:17.580 align:start position:0%
watch all this and it was even more
 
03:31:20.269 --> 03:31:20.279 align:start position:0%
intimidating to be down traveling in it
 
03:31:22.309 --> 03:31:22.319 align:start position:0%
since the Ackman of the beats the boat
 
03:31:24.530 --> 03:31:24.540 align:start position:0%
speed limits more families now drift
 
03:31:27.410 --> 03:31:27.420 align:start position:0%
more fishermen fish and more kayakers
 
03:31:29.690 --> 03:31:29.700 align:start position:0%
and paddle boarders venture out into
 
03:31:31.790 --> 03:31:31.800 align:start position:0%
this part of the lake the lake is
 
03:31:33.769 --> 03:31:33.779 align:start position:0%
especially the broads is inviting for
 
03:31:36.110 --> 03:31:36.120 align:start position:0%
all to enjoy and the gentleman who
 
03:31:39.590 --> 03:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
actually testified earlier had a good
 
03:31:41.450 --> 03:31:41.460 align:start position:0%
analogy of having this area be like a
 
03:31:43.490 --> 03:31:43.500 align:start position:0%
park I mean you increase the boat speed
 
03:31:44.690 --> 03:31:44.700 align:start position:0%
limits you're going to drive all the
 
03:31:46.610 --> 03:31:46.620 align:start position:0%
people out of this area
 
03:31:48.710 --> 03:31:48.720 align:start position:0%
and I don't see where creating a
 
03:31:50.510 --> 03:31:50.520 align:start position:0%
free-for-all drag strip benefits the
 
03:31:52.910 --> 03:31:52.920 align:start position:0%
majority especially in an area that is
 
03:31:55.550 --> 03:31:55.560 align:start position:0%
the Hub of the lake and experiences a
 
03:31:57.290 --> 03:31:57.300 align:start position:0%
high volume of use
 
03:32:00.349 --> 03:32:00.359 align:start position:0%
don't burden rain Patrol with any more
 
03:32:00.359 --> 03:32:02.210 align:start position:0%
don't burden rain Patrol with any more
responsibility

03:32:02.210 --> 03:32:02.220 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
03:32:04.130 --> 03:32:04.140 align:start position:0%
and individuals who operate these high
 
03:32:05.990 --> 03:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
performance boats in the past when I've
 
03:32:09.110 --> 03:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
listened to testimony justify their
 
03:32:10.910 --> 03:32:10.920 align:start position:0%
desire for the speed by saying their
 
03:32:12.830 --> 03:32:12.840 align:start position:0%
experienced boat handlers I don't
 
03:32:15.650 --> 03:32:15.660 align:start position:0%
dispute that and they probably are
 
03:32:18.110 --> 03:32:18.120 align:start position:0%
but you know everyone makes mistakes
 
03:32:20.030 --> 03:32:20.040 align:start position:0%
we're all human
 
03:32:23.690 --> 03:32:23.700 align:start position:0%
and please itl hb448 and don't give
 
03:32:26.630 --> 03:32:26.640 align:start position:0%
speed the opportunity to create a crisis
 
03:32:28.969 --> 03:32:28.979 align:start position:0%
and one more thing my father he taught
 
03:32:30.590 --> 03:32:30.600 align:start position:0%
me how to drive a car
 
03:32:33.050 --> 03:32:33.060 align:start position:0%
and he always used to remind me the
 
03:32:35.030 --> 03:32:35.040 align:start position:0%
faster you go the faster you got to
 
03:32:37.190 --> 03:32:37.200 align:start position:0%
think and I believe that also carries
 
03:32:39.050 --> 03:32:39.060 align:start position:0%
over into voting
 
03:32:40.790 --> 03:32:40.800 align:start position:0%
and dear old dad was right I hate to
 
03:32:43.790 --> 03:32:43.800 align:start position:0%
admit thank you for your time
 
03:32:46.429 --> 03:32:46.439 align:start position:0%
any questions seeing none thank you for
 
03:32:48.229 --> 03:32:48.239 align:start position:0%
your testimony
 
03:32:52.849 --> 03:32:52.859 align:start position:0%
up next Mark Watson on Deck Ken Robbins
 
03:32:56.570 --> 03:32:56.580 align:start position:0%
Mark good afternoon I'm going to read a
 
03:32:58.969 --> 03:32:58.979 align:start position:0%
letter from a marina owner on the lake
 
03:33:02.450 --> 03:33:02.460 align:start position:0%
his name is uh Bob Conrad dear committee
 
03:33:05.870 --> 03:33:05.880 align:start position:0%
members I am Bob comrade owner of North
 
03:33:08.809 --> 03:33:08.819 align:start position:0%
North Water Marine formerly thurston's
 
03:33:11.809 --> 03:33:11.819 align:start position:0%
Marina in Weir's Beach while I became a
 
03:33:15.349 --> 03:33:15.359 align:start position:0%
marina owner in 2021 I had been a
 
03:33:17.090 --> 03:33:17.100 align:start position:0%
property owner on Lake Winnipesaukee
 
03:33:20.809 --> 03:33:20.819 align:start position:0%
since 2000 and a boater on Lake minnisac
 
03:33:22.870 --> 03:33:22.880 align:start position:0%
Winnipesaukee since
 
03:33:25.790 --> 03:33:25.800 align:start position:0%
1995. so I've experienced a lake with
 
03:33:29.150 --> 03:33:29.160 align:start position:0%
and without speed limits it's clear to
 
03:33:31.610 --> 03:33:31.620 align:start position:0%
me that Lake Winnipesaukee is a better
 
03:33:35.030 --> 03:33:35.040 align:start position:0%
place with speed limits in all areas I
 
03:33:38.269 --> 03:33:38.279 align:start position:0%
oppose HB 448
 
03:33:40.790 --> 03:33:40.800 align:start position:0%
as a boater I do not want to return to
 
03:33:42.889 --> 03:33:42.899 align:start position:0%
the days of being intimidated and
 
03:33:45.469 --> 03:33:45.479 align:start position:0%
endangered by high-speed boats anywhere
 
03:33:46.790 --> 03:33:46.800 align:start position:0%
on the lake
 
03:33:49.309 --> 03:33:49.319 align:start position:0%
I personally had multiple dangerous
 
03:33:52.070 --> 03:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
encounters with high-speed boats failing
 
03:33:53.690 --> 03:33:53.700 align:start position:0%
to yield the right away
 
03:33:53.700 --> 03:33:55.929 align:start position:0%
to yield the right away
creating

03:33:55.929 --> 03:33:55.939 align:start position:0%
creating
 
03:33:59.809 --> 03:33:59.819 align:start position:0%
anxiety for everyone in my party
 
03:34:02.210 --> 03:34:02.220 align:start position:0%
as a marina owner on Lake Winnipesaukee
 
03:34:05.030 --> 03:34:05.040 align:start position:0%
our business depends on families feeling
 
03:34:07.550 --> 03:34:07.560 align:start position:0%
comfortable and safe boating in all
 
03:34:09.349 --> 03:34:09.359 align:start position:0%
areas of the lake
 
03:34:12.530 --> 03:34:12.540 align:start position:0%
families often multi-generational are
 
03:34:14.389 --> 03:34:14.399 align:start position:0%
attracted to the lake which drives the
 
03:34:17.170 --> 03:34:17.180 align:start position:0%
local economy through real estate
 
03:34:20.870 --> 03:34:20.880 align:start position:0%
businesses on and off the water removing
 
03:34:23.330 --> 03:34:23.340 align:start position:0%
the lake speed limit or increasing it is
 
03:34:25.849 --> 03:34:25.859 align:start position:0%
a serious risk to that attraction for
 
03:34:28.250 --> 03:34:28.260 align:start position:0%
families and the local economy
 
03:34:31.190 --> 03:34:31.200 align:start position:0%
so as a resident voter and business
 
03:34:33.429 --> 03:34:33.439 align:start position:0%
owner I oppose
 
03:34:37.010 --> 03:34:37.020 align:start position:0%
hb448 and ask you to oppose it as well
 
03:34:41.030 --> 03:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
best regards Bob Conrad
 
03:34:43.969 --> 03:34:43.979 align:start position:0%
and I also personally I have a cottage
 
03:34:46.670 --> 03:34:46.680 align:start position:0%
on the lake for over 35 years and I've
 
03:34:48.349 --> 03:34:48.359 align:start position:0%
seen the lake before and after speed
 
03:34:51.769 --> 03:34:51.779 align:start position:0%
limits and it is really impressive what
 
03:34:53.929 --> 03:34:53.939 align:start position:0%
the speed limits have done to the safety
 
03:34:55.969 --> 03:34:55.979 align:start position:0%
on the lake thank you
 
03:34:58.670 --> 03:34:58.680 align:start position:0%
any questions seeing none thank you for
 
03:35:02.210 --> 03:35:02.220 align:start position:0%
your testimony up next Mr Robbins
 
03:35:06.110 --> 03:35:06.120 align:start position:0%
on Deck Miss bozelli
 
03:35:07.849 --> 03:35:07.859 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your time good
 
03:35:09.830 --> 03:35:09.840 align:start position:0%
afternoon my name is Ken Robbins I'm
 
03:35:12.710 --> 03:35:12.720 align:start position:0%
here both on behalf of camp tabian in
 
03:35:16.070 --> 03:35:16.080 align:start position:0%
Alton Bay which is a century-old
 
03:35:18.410 --> 03:35:18.420 align:start position:0%
summer camp where I am the executive
 
03:35:20.330 --> 03:35:20.340 align:start position:0%
director but also on behalf of the New
 
03:35:22.070 --> 03:35:22.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Camp Directors Association
 
03:35:25.790 --> 03:35:25.800 align:start position:0%
which represents the approximately 180
 
03:35:28.190 --> 03:35:28.200 align:start position:0%
residential and day youth recreation
 
03:35:30.170 --> 03:35:30.180 align:start position:0%
camps in the state many of those are on
 
03:35:32.750 --> 03:35:32.760 align:start position:0%
Lake Winnipesaukee most of my points
 
03:35:34.670 --> 03:35:34.680 align:start position:0%
have been better articulated by those
 
03:35:37.070 --> 03:35:37.080 align:start position:0%
who have come before me in opposition to
 
03:35:42.050 --> 03:35:42.060 align:start position:0%
HB 448 I'll simply re-emphasize that our
 
03:35:44.330 --> 03:35:44.340 align:start position:0%
opposition stems from concern for how
 
03:35:46.490 --> 03:35:46.500 align:start position:0%
increased speed coupled with increased
 
03:35:49.130 --> 03:35:49.140 align:start position:0%
traffic puts children
 
03:35:52.190 --> 03:35:52.200 align:start position:0%
and the staff that are in our Care at
 
03:35:55.670 --> 03:35:55.680 align:start position:0%
increa increased risk and we have a duty
 
03:35:57.650 --> 03:35:57.660 align:start position:0%
to maximize the safety of all who share
 
03:35:59.809 --> 03:35:59.819 align:start position:0%
the lake thank you thank you any
 
03:36:01.849 --> 03:36:01.859 align:start position:0%
questions John Cena thank you for your
 
03:36:01.859 --> 03:36:03.370 align:start position:0%
questions John Cena thank you for your
testimony

03:36:03.370 --> 03:36:03.380 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
03:36:09.590 --> 03:36:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:11.870 --> 03:36:11.880 align:start position:0%
I just for a very long period of time I
 
03:36:13.550 --> 03:36:13.560 align:start position:0%
think you realize the passion behind
 
03:36:16.130 --> 03:36:16.140 align:start position:0%
many of us here regarding the safety of
 
03:36:18.170 --> 03:36:18.180 align:start position:0%
Lake Winnipesaukee I've lived on the
 
03:36:20.090 --> 03:36:20.100 align:start position:0%
lake on a small island adjacent to the
 
03:36:23.530 --> 03:36:23.540 align:start position:0%
broads for 41 years and have seen it all
 
03:36:27.229 --> 03:36:27.239 align:start position:0%
mostly the safe and a lot of unsafe I'm
 
03:36:29.150 --> 03:36:29.160 align:start position:0%
very concerned about increase in speed
 
03:36:31.670 --> 03:36:31.680 align:start position:0%
limit we have young youngsters and
 
03:36:33.469 --> 03:36:33.479 align:start position:0%
sailing programs who sail across the
 
03:36:36.469 --> 03:36:36.479 align:start position:0%
broads and to think about not just one
 
03:36:39.469 --> 03:36:39.479 align:start position:0%
but maybe two boats traveling at 60
 
03:36:42.410 --> 03:36:42.420 align:start position:0%
miles five miles per hour and the this
 
03:36:44.929 --> 03:36:44.939 align:start position:0%
is approximately 150 feet here so you
 
03:36:46.610 --> 03:36:46.620 align:start position:0%
could have one there and you could have
 
03:36:49.670 --> 03:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
one there running side by side at 65
 
03:36:51.710 --> 03:36:51.720 align:start position:0%
miles per hour and then maybe you have
 
03:36:54.530 --> 03:36:54.540 align:start position:0%
40 children out in small sailboats how
 
03:36:57.349 --> 03:36:57.359 align:start position:0%
is that that's just not going to work I
 
03:37:00.110 --> 03:37:00.120 align:start position:0%
think one of the one of the proponents
 
03:37:03.170 --> 03:37:03.180 align:start position:0%
of the the new law talked about minority
 
03:37:05.030 --> 03:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
versus majority
 
03:37:07.729 --> 03:37:07.739 align:start position:0%
yes it is a minority versus a majority
 
03:37:09.670 --> 03:37:09.680 align:start position:0%
it's just inverse to his proposal
 
03:37:12.590 --> 03:37:12.600 align:start position:0%
obviously to me and to many others the
 
03:37:14.389 --> 03:37:14.399 align:start position:0%
majority is we do not want to see this
 
03:37:16.969 --> 03:37:16.979 align:start position:0%
bill passed the minority is are those
 
03:37:19.190 --> 03:37:19.200 align:start position:0%
who own these extremely high speed boats
 
03:37:21.650 --> 03:37:21.660 align:start position:0%
and have one intent which is just to go
 
03:37:24.650 --> 03:37:24.660 align:start position:0%
fast I own a power boat I go maybe 30
 
03:37:27.410 --> 03:37:27.420 align:start position:0%
miles an hour maybe 32 I can take my
 
03:37:29.510 --> 03:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
children water skiing we can go for a
 
03:37:31.790 --> 03:37:31.800 align:start position:0%
Sunset Cruise we can go tubing we can go
 
03:37:33.950 --> 03:37:33.960 align:start position:0%
for ice cream how fast you really need
 
03:37:36.590 --> 03:37:36.600 align:start position:0%
to go so thank you for listening and
 
03:37:39.830 --> 03:37:39.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for opposing this bill
 
03:37:42.290 --> 03:37:42.300 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony I have two
 
03:37:45.830 --> 03:37:45.840 align:start position:0%

03:37:45.840 --> 03:37:47.090 align:start position:0%
cards left up next

and the last card Mr Ehrenberg
 
03:37:57.229 --> 03:37:57.239 align:start position:0%
Miss Hixon thank you hello my name is
 
03:37:59.870 --> 03:37:59.880 align:start position:0%
ananya Hickson I'm from Wolfeboro
 
03:38:03.290 --> 03:38:03.300 align:start position:0%
prior to the passage of the 45 mile per
 
03:38:05.990 --> 03:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
hour speed limit Winnipesaukee as you've
 
03:38:08.630 --> 03:38:08.640 align:start position:0%
heard has suffered from being considered
 
03:38:12.590 --> 03:38:12.600 align:start position:0%
the cowboy Wild West destination several
 
03:38:15.290 --> 03:38:15.300 align:start position:0%
fatal and high-profile accidents
 
03:38:18.170 --> 03:38:18.180 align:start position:0%
involving high-powered speed boats
 
03:38:21.590 --> 03:38:21.600 align:start position:0%
had contributed to this reputation and
 
03:38:25.309 --> 03:38:25.319 align:start position:0%
this is why over 300 businesses signed
 
03:38:28.070 --> 03:38:28.080 align:start position:0%
on to supporting the speed limit law
 
03:38:30.769 --> 03:38:30.779 align:start position:0%
speed limits on the lake have made a
 
03:38:33.070 --> 03:38:33.080 align:start position:0%
remarkable difference on the improved
 
03:38:36.769 --> 03:38:36.779 align:start position:0%
atmosphere of tranquility and safety for
 
03:38:39.349 --> 03:38:39.359 align:start position:0%
all who recreate there
 
03:38:43.190 --> 03:38:43.200 align:start position:0%
I take issue with what some have said
 
03:38:47.269 --> 03:38:47.279 align:start position:0%
about these speedboat drivers being the
 
03:38:50.450 --> 03:38:50.460 align:start position:0%
safest and most responsible voters one
 
03:38:53.530 --> 03:38:53.540 align:start position:0%
only has to remember the Fatal Hartman
 
03:38:57.469 --> 03:38:57.479 align:start position:0%
Littlefield accident the Erica blizzard
 
03:39:00.650 --> 03:39:00.660 align:start position:0%
accident the 2020 accident where a
 
03:39:03.830 --> 03:39:03.840 align:start position:0%
kayaker was seriously injured or the
 
03:39:07.729 --> 03:39:07.739 align:start position:0%
swimmer hit by the speedboat at 65 miles
 
03:39:10.190 --> 03:39:10.200 align:start position:0%
per hour in 2015.
 
03:39:12.769 --> 03:39:12.779 align:start position:0%
and you will understand that this is not
 
03:39:16.309 --> 03:39:16.319 align:start position:0%
necessarily true that these drivers are
 
03:39:19.070 --> 03:39:19.080 align:start position:0%
the safest and most responsible
 
03:39:21.469 --> 03:39:21.479 align:start position:0%
a recent study conducted by Dartmouth
 
03:39:23.150 --> 03:39:23.160 align:start position:0%
College and commissioned by the Lake
 
03:39:25.910 --> 03:39:25.920 align:start position:0%
Winnipesaukee Association showed that
 
03:39:29.150 --> 03:39:29.160 align:start position:0%
the lake generates over 17 billion
 
03:39:32.570 --> 03:39:32.580 align:start position:0%
dollars for the region and the state
 
03:39:35.950 --> 03:39:35.960 align:start position:0%
Taurus Anglers primary and second
 
03:39:38.630 --> 03:39:38.640 align:start position:0%
homeowners are attracted to the lake for
 
03:39:41.630 --> 03:39:41.640 align:start position:0%
its special peaceful Beauty and family
 
03:39:41.640 --> 03:39:43.429 align:start position:0%
its special peaceful Beauty and family
Recreation

03:39:43.429 --> 03:39:43.439 align:start position:0%
Recreation
 
03:39:46.309 --> 03:39:46.319 align:start position:0%
they feel safer boating as do we with
 
03:39:49.010 --> 03:39:49.020 align:start position:0%
the current speed limits why abolish the
 
03:39:51.530 --> 03:39:51.540 align:start position:0%
speed limits for a select few at the
 
03:39:54.490 --> 03:39:54.500 align:start position:0%
expense of the majority
 
03:39:56.510 --> 03:39:56.520 align:start position:0%
marginalizing the majority of family
 
03:39:59.269 --> 03:39:59.279 align:start position:0%
boaters on the lake is not good for our
 
03:40:01.550 --> 03:40:01.560 align:start position:0%
local economy
 
03:40:04.670 --> 03:40:04.680 align:start position:0%
six marinas and boat dealers opposing HB
 
03:40:07.429 --> 03:40:07.439 align:start position:0%
448 can attest to this
 
03:40:10.190 --> 03:40:10.200 align:start position:0%
our dollars to our state covers
 
03:40:13.429 --> 03:40:13.439 align:start position:0%
have been these uh I'm sorry our economy
 
03:40:15.110 --> 03:40:15.120 align:start position:0%
thrives on tourism
 
03:40:17.990 --> 03:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
and which contributes millions of
 
03:40:20.690 --> 03:40:20.700 align:start position:0%
dollars to our state coffers it is in
 
03:40:22.729 --> 03:40:22.739 align:start position:0%
part why New Hampshire needs no sales
 
03:40:22.739 --> 03:40:24.290 align:start position:0%
part why New Hampshire needs no sales
tax

03:40:24.290 --> 03:40:24.300 align:start position:0%
tax
 
03:40:26.349 --> 03:40:26.359 align:start position:0%
I urge you to vote
 
03:40:28.969 --> 03:40:28.979 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate on this
 
03:40:30.950 --> 03:40:30.960 align:start position:0%
Reckless and dangerous bill
 
03:40:35.809 --> 03:40:35.819 align:start position:0%
and just a more personal note I just I
 
03:40:37.610 --> 03:40:37.620 align:start position:0%
don't want my children and my
 
03:40:40.130 --> 03:40:40.140 align:start position:0%
grandchildren to be exposed to these
 
03:40:43.130 --> 03:40:43.140 align:start position:0%
dangers and without a speed limit I will
 
03:40:45.410 --> 03:40:45.420 align:start position:0%
move to a different Lake and have my
 
03:40:48.110 --> 03:40:48.120 align:start position:0%

the written materials and we'll be back
 
03:47:57.550 --> 03:47:57.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:00.110 --> 03:48:00.120 align:start position:0%
can I ask the committee members to take
 
03:48:02.929 --> 03:48:02.939 align:start position:0%
their seat so I can reconvene the exact
 
03:48:02.939 --> 03:48:44.690 align:start position:0%
their seat so I can reconvene the exact
session

03:48:44.690 --> 03:48:44.700 align:start position:0%

so it's 247 members have had a chance to

read the written testimony and to
 
03:48:52.330 --> 03:48:52.340 align:start position:0%

03:50:50.269 --> 03:50:50.279 align:start position:0%
next is that we heard overwhelming
 
03:50:52.309 --> 03:50:52.319 align:start position:0%
testimony that this would not be felt to
 
03:50:54.290 --> 03:50:54.300 align:start position:0%
be safe by people who have been
 
03:50:54.300 --> 03:50:56.269 align:start position:0%

operating all of the things that we find
 
03:51:03.650 --> 03:51:03.660 align:start position:0%
special about New Hampshire where a lot

of children come from other states to go
 
03:51:08.210 --> 03:51:08.220 align:start position:0%
to camp and we really need to think
 
03:51:10.550 --> 03:51:10.560 align:start position:0%
about the will of
 
03:51:13.910 --> 03:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
just a few people and what can happen
 
03:51:16.610 --> 03:51:16.620 align:start position:0%

after weeks and weeks of watching these
 
03:51:35.340 --> 03:51:36.889 align:start position:0%
after weeks and weeks of watching these
