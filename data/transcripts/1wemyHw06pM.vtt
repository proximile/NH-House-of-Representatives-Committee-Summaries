division 3 today's uh another
 
00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 align:start position:0%
informational hearing uh we're going to
 
00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 align:start position:0%
hear from the dep Department of Health
 
00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 align:start position:0%
and Human Services on the topics of U
 
00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.680 align:start position:0%
DCF elderly and Adult Services services
 
00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.320 align:start position:0%
for individuals with disabilities or
 
00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960 align:start position:0%
mental health substance use
 
00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 align:start position:0%
disorders um and then at the end I'm
 
00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 align:start position:0%
going to allow the public to comment if
 
00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 align:start position:0%
there's anyone that's come in and wants
 
00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:07.719 align:start position:0%
to make a comment um uh the reason that
 
00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 align:start position:0%
we're having these hearings before the
 
00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 align:start position:0%
budget is released is that these are
 
00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 align:start position:0%
areas in which um we have a very uh
 
00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 align:start position:0%
strong uh two two things occur we we we
 
00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 align:start position:0%
invest a significant amount of General
 
00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 align:start position:0%
funds in these areas and with our our
 
00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
budget issue coming up we have to really
 
00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 align:start position:0%
be very careful and look very carefully
 
00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 align:start position:0%
at where we're spending General funds
 
00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 align:start position:0%
and also this is an area where uh the
 
00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:41.879 align:start position:0%
the proportional share between General
 
00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 align:start position:0%
funds and the federal government uh just
 
00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 align:start position:0%
suggests that there's there's um a a
 
00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 align:start position:0%
bigger percentage than in other
 
00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 align:start position:0%
Departments of General funds to um
 
00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 align:start position:0%
federal funds so so these are these are
 
00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 align:start position:0%
areas that we we need to start taking to
 
00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 align:start position:0%
look at and getting to understand uh
 
00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:06.599 align:start position:0%
very carefully because of those things
 
00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.080 align:start position:0%
um before we get
 
00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 align:start position:0%
started uh with the Department I'm going
 
00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 align:start position:0%
to I'm going to um surprise
 
00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:15.949 align:start position:0%
to I'm going to um surprise
representative

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:03:19.589 --> 00:03:19.599 align:start position:0%
walner and say earlier we talked about
 
00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.360 align:start position:0%
um arranging a visit to Waypoint and
 
00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 align:start position:0%
since that was the most recent hearing
 
00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 align:start position:0%
we've had let's let's just wrap that up
 
00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 align:start position:0%
and see if we can figure out when we
 
00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 align:start position:0%
might take a tour do you want to talk
 
00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 align:start position:0%
great they they would um welcome us to
 
00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:39.080 align:start position:0%
come down and see the
 
00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
shelter and I just thought it really
 
00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:44.319 align:start position:0%
would depend on what our work schedule
 
00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.360 align:start position:0%
is here when do we have free time yeah
 
00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:50.319 align:start position:0%
so so Mr Ripple um make sure I don't
 
00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 align:start position:0%
make a mistake with this please um but I
 
00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 align:start position:0%
think uh Tuesday the 4th we don't have
 
00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 align:start position:0%
anything scheduled yet for division
 
00:04:01.869 --> 00:04:01.879 align:start position:0%
three that's correct I think you only
 
00:04:04.429 --> 00:04:04.439 align:start position:0%
have Monday afternoon at this point okay
 
00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760 align:start position:0%
do are there other meetings that you're
 
00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 align:start position:0%
trying to arrange with the Department
 
00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:11.239 align:start position:0%
that would just haven't been settled yet
 
00:04:13.589 --> 00:04:13.599 align:start position:0%
no no as as far as I know there won't be
 
00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400 align:start position:0%
any other uh presentations from the
 
00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 align:start position:0%
Department until the governor's budget
 
00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 align:start position:0%
comes out unless you or the committee
 
00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 align:start position:0%
decide that you'd like others we we
 
00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:23.919 align:start position:0%
added back potentially another visit by
 
00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 align:start position:0%
it okay and and I can set up a separate
 
00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:28.639 align:start position:0%
date for that uh but that as of now that
 
00:04:31.029 --> 00:04:31.039 align:start position:0%
would be the only one okay and and there
 
00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120 align:start position:0%
might be a contract review we should
 
00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 align:start position:0%
brainstorm that okay so so with that uh
 
00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:40.880 align:start position:0%
representative walner I I can nominate
 
00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:43.919 align:start position:0%
the fourth or or the 5ifth of
 
00:04:46.749 --> 00:04:46.759 align:start position:0%
February what do you
 
00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
think I actually think the fifth might
 
00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:52.160 align:start position:0%
work better okay the only thing I got
 
00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 align:start position:0%
going on is in the morning I want to
 
00:04:56.029 --> 00:04:56.039 align:start position:0%
talk about rights of conscious for
 
00:04:59.150 --> 00:04:59.160 align:start position:0%
medical professionals but but I got all
 
00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:03.440 align:start position:0%
after 11:00 uh and this is in Manchester
 
00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:07.880 align:start position:0%
right yes okay on Hanover Street so uh a
 
00:05:10.029 --> 00:05:10.039 align:start position:0%
representative seaworth uh thank you Mr
 
00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:13.560 align:start position:0%
chairman I recall listening to uh the
 
00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:17.919 align:start position:0%
Waypoint people talk y um that they said
 
00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:20.120 align:start position:0%
we welcome you anytime after and they
 
00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.000 align:start position:0%
gave a date and I don't remember that
 
00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
date at all the fifth was the date what
 
00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:25.919 align:start position:0%
the fifth the fifth so we want to make
 
00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:27.960 align:start position:0%
sure we don't go when they told
 
00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:30.520 align:start position:0%
literally did they say after the fth or
 
00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:32.639 align:start position:0%
fifth or after fifth or after I think
 
00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:35.120 align:start position:0%
that's so let's let's you want to try
 
00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:38.120 align:start position:0%
coordinating us for the fifth yeah I
 
00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:40.880 align:start position:0%
will definitely and then Mr Ripple
 
00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:43.800 align:start position:0%
should I submit a speaker request
 
00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:45.720 align:start position:0%
because we're all going to be traveling
 
00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:48.520 align:start position:0%
on a site visit and there because some
 
00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:49.919 align:start position:0%
people may want to get mileage
 
00:05:52.029 --> 00:05:52.039 align:start position:0%
reimbursement like representative
 
00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:53.800 align:start position:0%
Stringham he doesn't have any money and
 
00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:56.240 align:start position:0%
he comes from the North Country so so
 
00:05:58.590 --> 00:05:58.600 align:start position:0%
that's a long drive for him uh that's up
 
00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:00.360 align:start position:0%
to you I'm honestly not sure how that
 
00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:03.560 align:start position:0%
process works so if it's it's something
 
00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:04.800 align:start position:0%
You' think you'd like to do on behalf of
 
00:06:06.029 --> 00:06:06.039 align:start position:0%
the members I'll check with the
 
00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:08.360 align:start position:0%
speaker's office I when I when I we went
 
00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:11.880 align:start position:0%
to glencliffe I found out after the fact
 
00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:13.960 align:start position:0%
if I had told the speaker reimbursement
 
00:06:15.749 --> 00:06:15.759 align:start position:0%
for mileage would have been easy and
 
00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:18.880 align:start position:0%
obvious but I didn't so I see okay that
 
00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:21.080 align:start position:0%
sounds like a good idea then oh
 
00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:24.360 align:start position:0%
okay all right so morning afternoon I
 
00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:28.160 align:start position:0%
I'd prefer afternoon okay so I will
 
00:06:30.469 --> 00:06:30.479 align:start position:0%
notify them that we would come in what
 
00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:33.560 align:start position:0%
time in the afternoon I'm I'm flexible
 
00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:35.680 align:start position:0%
I'm wide open so at this point I would
 
00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:38.360 align:start position:0%
listen to what works for them is did you
 
00:06:40.589 --> 00:06:40.599 align:start position:0%
have more to say or something to say
 
00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:42.120 align:start position:0%
well it's just I have a build to
 
00:06:43.629 --> 00:06:43.639 align:start position:0%
introduce both one in the morning and
 
00:06:45.309 --> 00:06:45.319 align:start position:0%
one in the afternoon but what what's
 
00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:47.680 align:start position:0%
your introduction in the afternoon what
 
00:06:50.029 --> 00:06:50.039 align:start position:0%
is it it's at one
 
00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:53.000 align:start position:0%
o'clock so could we meet at ask them if
 
00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:55.520 align:start position:0%
we could meet them at 3: a in the
 
00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:57.400 align:start position:0%
afternoon or is that too late we
 
00:07:00.469 --> 00:07:00.479 align:start position:0%
actually have a commitment at 3 o oh
 
00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:03.280 align:start position:0%
yeah we do yes do you okay do you have
 
00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:05.160 align:start position:0%
an alternative to somebody else to
 
00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
introduce your one o00 bill
 
00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:10.680 align:start position:0%
representative string 11 o' about 11 no
 
00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:14.280 align:start position:0%
but maybe we can we can possibly but uh
 
00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:17.720 align:start position:0%
maybe we can arrange uh two visits like
 
00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:21.280 align:start position:0%
we did for um the cunu Youth Detention
 
00:07:24.749 --> 00:07:24.759 align:start position:0%
Center last term okay so representative
 
00:07:27.309 --> 00:07:27.319 align:start position:0%
walner I I could I could Bay down there
 
00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:31.160 align:start position:0%
at 11:00 or thereafter okay okay I'll
 
00:07:34.029 --> 00:07:34.039 align:start position:0%
organize it for 11:00 and make sure that
 
00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:35.800 align:start position:0%
everyone gets
 
00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:39.080 align:start position:0%
directions and probably you need to
 
00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:41.400 align:start position:0%
we'll let us know if you're going to
 
00:07:43.189 --> 00:07:43.199 align:start position:0%
come we'll send that an we'll send an
 
00:07:46.629 --> 00:07:46.639 align:start position:0%
email to everyone on the division and
 
00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:48.120 align:start position:0%
hopefully I'll know whether or not
 
00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:50.240 align:start position:0%
people could submit for
 
00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
mileage okay don't count on
 
00:07:57.629 --> 00:07:57.639 align:start position:0%
it but I'll ask all right so that that's
 
00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:01.400 align:start position:0%
that and I think think we're done with
 
00:08:03.029 --> 00:08:03.039 align:start position:0%
our own internal
 
00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:05.400 align:start position:0%
administrivia so if the department would
 
00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:08.080 align:start position:0%
like to come up and start talking dcyf
 
00:08:28.189 --> 00:08:28.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:31.360 align:start position:0%
topics okay begin so good afternoon
 
00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:33.560 align:start position:0%
everyone again my name is Trish Tilly I
 
00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:35.080 align:start position:0%
am an associate commissioner here at the
 
00:08:36.790 --> 00:08:36.800 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
00:08:38.790 --> 00:08:38.800 align:start position:0%
and given your conversation you just had
 
00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:41.760 align:start position:0%
about scheduling we have failed to tell
 
00:08:43.509 --> 00:08:43.519 align:start position:0%
you um I realized that I should have
 
00:08:45.269 --> 00:08:45.279 align:start position:0%
told you right before the meeting that
 
00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:47.200 align:start position:0%
Chris santanello associate commissioner
 
00:08:48.829 --> 00:08:48.839 align:start position:0%
santanello was also supposed to be
 
00:08:52.509 --> 00:08:52.519 align:start position:0%
joining me today she is home with flu
 
00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:54.640 align:start position:0%
some sort of illness and so we will not
 
00:08:57.269 --> 00:08:57.279 align:start position:0%
be talking about um developmental
 
00:08:59.550 --> 00:08:59.560 align:start position:0%
disabilities and healthy aging so so
 
00:09:00.949 --> 00:09:00.959 align:start position:0%
we'll look to you to see if we want to
 
00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:02.920 align:start position:0%
reschedule that for another time tack it
 
00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:07.120 align:start position:0%
to something else so I would say yes and
 
00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:10.120 align:start position:0%
and um so Mr Ripple and I think Mr White
 
00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:12.560 align:start position:0%
have been working on scheduling so let's
 
00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:16.200 align:start position:0%
just uh reschedule those two great and
 
00:09:19.389 --> 00:09:19.399 align:start position:0%
if it if it tied up with it or or
 
00:09:21.949 --> 00:09:21.959 align:start position:0%
contracts or whatever else that that's
 
00:09:25.509 --> 00:09:25.519 align:start position:0%
fine great thank you so I we appreciate
 
00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:27.920 align:start position:0%
your um flexibility in that so the good
 
00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:29.720 align:start position:0%
news is that hopefully I will only take
 
00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:31.600 align:start position:0%
one hour of your time today so that's
 
00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:33.160 align:start position:0%
even better you get outside and enjoy
 
00:09:35.509 --> 00:09:35.519 align:start position:0%
this gorgeous day outside so that's a
 
00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:37.560 align:start position:0%
small gift that I have and we also are
 
00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
giving you the gift of not having germs
 
00:09:41.829 --> 00:09:41.839 align:start position:0%
in this room so that's also important um
 
00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:43.680 align:start position:0%
I hope all of you have had your flu shot
 
00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:45.640 align:start position:0%
or um any other things that you would
 
00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:47.640 align:start position:0%
like to consider around that so what am
 
00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:49.680 align:start position:0%
I going to do for this next hour I am
 
00:09:51.310 --> 00:09:51.320 align:start position:0%
going to focus on three things I am
 
00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:52.680 align:start position:0%
going to focus on our children's
 
00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:54.800 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health System I'm going to
 
00:09:57.790 --> 00:09:57.800 align:start position:0%
focus a bit on DCF our division for
 
00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:00.160 align:start position:0%
children Youth and Family
 
00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
specifically as that relates to
 
00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:05.600 align:start position:0%
residential care and um YDC or the
 
00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:07.720 align:start position:0%
sununu youth services as we have it
 
00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:10.760 align:start position:0%
right now and the new build in YDC and
 
00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:11.920 align:start position:0%
then I'm going to talk a little bit
 
00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:14.640 align:start position:0%
about the adult mental health system so
 
00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:16.000 align:start position:0%
those are going to that's the universe
 
00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:18.120 align:start position:0%
of the work that um I'm going to present
 
00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:19.760 align:start position:0%
right now always happy to take other
 
00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:21.920 align:start position:0%
questions as we move forward you have a
 
00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:23.880 align:start position:0%
slide deck in front of you that you can
 
00:10:26.069 --> 00:10:26.079 align:start position:0%
follow along if you would like there is
 
00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:28.760 align:start position:0%
also another document in front of you um
 
00:10:30.949 --> 00:10:30.959 align:start position:0%
that has some numbers on it it says 18
 
00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:33.480 align:start position:0%
2122 this is in response to
 
00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:35.360 align:start position:0%
representative Daniels had asked a
 
00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
question around eligibility it's not a
 
00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:39.480 align:start position:0%
very straightforward answer so I thought
 
00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:41.000 align:start position:0%
it would be easier if we put it on paper
 
00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:45.800 align:start position:0%
for you so all right so let's jump into
 
00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
our presentation so on slide two you're
 
00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:49.600 align:start position:0%
going to see the slide if you'll recall
 
00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:53.120 align:start position:0%
that we talked about on Monday um one of
 
00:10:55.629 --> 00:10:55.639 align:start position:0%
the things that I love the most about
 
00:10:57.350 --> 00:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
working at the department of the health
 
00:10:59.790 --> 00:10:59.800 align:start position:0%
and human services in New Hampshire is
 
00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:02.600 align:start position:0%
the fact that we have the opportunity to
 
00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:05.320 align:start position:0%
tie together so many of the services
 
00:11:07.389 --> 00:11:07.399 align:start position:0%
that impact your families impact your
 
00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:09.920 align:start position:0%
constituents and do it in a thoughtful
 
00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:12.680 align:start position:0%
strategic way our road map has
 
00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:15.680 align:start position:0%
identified our strategies and we're able
 
00:11:19.509 --> 00:11:19.519 align:start position:0%
to think about how kids adults older
 
00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:21.800 align:start position:0%
adults people who need specialized
 
00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:25.120 align:start position:0%
Services how do all those systems work
 
00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:28.040 align:start position:0%
together instead of just in isolation
 
00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:30.320 align:start position:0%
and we do that you know specifically for
 
00:11:33.269 --> 00:11:33.279 align:start position:0%
today our plan was to talk about kids
 
00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:35.120 align:start position:0%
and talk about older adults and talk
 
00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:36.720 align:start position:0%
about some of those adults who need
 
00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:38.680 align:start position:0%
those specializ Services we'll do a
 
00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:40.480 align:start position:0%
little shift and really just focus on
 
00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:43.120 align:start position:0%
the kiddos and um the adult mental
 
00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:44.800 align:start position:0%
health system but I'd love to have you
 
00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:47.200 align:start position:0%
keep that in mind that that's really one
 
00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:49.360 align:start position:0%
of the benefits of being what is often
 
00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:51.440 align:start position:0%
called a super agency a very large
 
00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:53.920 align:start position:0%
agency that has large breath and depth
 
00:11:56.310 --> 00:11:56.320 align:start position:0%
within it is that we have an opportunity
 
00:11:59.389 --> 00:11:59.399 align:start position:0%
to strategize think and instead of
 
00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:02.200 align:start position:0%
working on individual projects really
 
00:12:04.629 --> 00:12:04.639 align:start position:0%
thinking of them as a whole and their
 
00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:06.760 align:start position:0%
crosscutting nature you know all the way
 
00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:08.560 align:start position:0%
from public health which many of you
 
00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:11.120 align:start position:0%
know is my my first work that I did that
 
00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:13.040 align:start position:0%
really thinks about the entire
 
00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:15.240 align:start position:0%
population and then as we think about
 
00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
the other programs in the department
 
00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:18.440 align:start position:0%
that focus on some more vulnerable
 
00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:20.600 align:start position:0%
groups that need added attention
 
00:12:22.389 --> 00:12:22.399 align:start position:0%
Children and Youth who have been abused
 
00:12:24.509 --> 00:12:24.519 align:start position:0%
or neglected adults and children who
 
00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:26.800 align:start position:0%
have developmental disabilities adults
 
00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
who might have mental health or
 
00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
behavioral health concerns that's the
 
00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:31.760 align:start position:0%
universe that we work in and that's
 
00:12:33.629 --> 00:12:33.639 align:start position:0%
where I think it is most exciting where
 
00:12:36.389 --> 00:12:36.399 align:start position:0%
we have opportunities um when we always
 
00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:38.560 align:start position:0%
have limited resources to make the best
 
00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:40.880 align:start position:0%
use of what we have and knit things
 
00:12:42.629 --> 00:12:42.639 align:start position:0%
together so they make it sense in the
 
00:12:45.310 --> 00:12:45.320 align:start position:0%
community and makes things easier in the
 
00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:47.000 align:start position:0%
community so let's jump in and start
 
00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:48.440 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:50.990 align:start position:0%
talking about
kids

00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:51.000 align:start position:0%
kids
 
00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:54.160 align:start position:0%
yes I want I want to contextualize this
 
00:12:56.829 --> 00:12:56.839 align:start position:0%
for myself and and for some of the newer
 
00:13:00.629 --> 00:13:00.639 align:start position:0%
folks um there there have been talks
 
00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:03.560 align:start position:0%
over the last two or three or four years
 
00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:06.160 align:start position:0%
of of possibly uh
 
00:13:10.269 --> 00:13:10.279 align:start position:0%
subdividing um uh DHHS into at least two
 
00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:12.760 align:start position:0%
distinct groups and what I think I just
 
00:13:16.949 --> 00:13:16.959 align:start position:0%
heard you say uh uh could be
 
00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:19.800 align:start position:0%
repurposed for the point of
 
00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:23.160 align:start position:0%
understanding that you perceive value
 
00:13:26.350 --> 00:13:26.360 align:start position:0%
and the Synergy of having a the current
 
00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
whole in intact DHHS
 
00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:31.560 align:start position:0%
and that we could be thinking of your
 
00:13:35.069 --> 00:13:35.079 align:start position:0%
statement as as as sort of food for
 
00:13:37.389 --> 00:13:37.399 align:start position:0%
thought when people do come around
 
00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:39.440 align:start position:0%
talking about the separation of the
 
00:13:41.269 --> 00:13:41.279 align:start position:0%
department that is correct that's a
 
00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:43.560 align:start position:0%
great summary thank you sir okay all
 
00:13:45.509 --> 00:13:45.519 align:start position:0%
right I I don't know that everyone knew
 
00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:48.360 align:start position:0%
that this is sort of the background and
 
00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:50.320 align:start position:0%
and even beyond that background it just
 
00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:52.000 align:start position:0%
makes sense to me so whether or not
 
00:13:54.629 --> 00:13:54.639 align:start position:0%
there's conversations happening in other
 
00:13:56.670 --> 00:13:56.680 align:start position:0%
rooms in this in the legislative office
 
00:13:58.590 --> 00:13:58.600 align:start position:0%
building around the what's the right
 
00:14:00.509 --> 00:14:00.519 align:start position:0%
size or what's the right constellation
 
00:14:03.310 --> 00:14:03.320 align:start position:0%
of services what I find Value in right
 
00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
now is the ability to have all of these
 
00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:08.240 align:start position:0%
programs under one leadership that has
 
00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:10.800 align:start position:0%
the ability to see the whole picture so
 
00:14:12.749 --> 00:14:12.759 align:start position:0%
either way it's important for some of
 
00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:14.320 align:start position:0%
the legislative conversations but it's
 
00:14:15.629 --> 00:14:15.639 align:start position:0%
also just important for the work that we
 
00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:17.600 align:start position:0%
do every day regardless of what goes on
 
00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:20.240 align:start position:0%
here all right thank you sure so I think
 
00:14:22.389 --> 00:14:22.399 align:start position:0%
you'll see that same theme on slide four
 
00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:24.360 align:start position:0%
as we flip there which is really around
 
00:14:26.110 --> 00:14:26.120 align:start position:0%
this integrated approach to serving
 
00:14:29.189 --> 00:14:29.199 align:start position:0%
youth so again today's plan was to focus
 
00:14:32.189 --> 00:14:32.199 align:start position:0%
us on um DCF our division for children
 
00:14:33.949 --> 00:14:33.959 align:start position:0%
youth and families our child welfare and
 
00:14:36.189 --> 00:14:36.199 align:start position:0%
Juvenile Justice program our division
 
00:14:38.269 --> 00:14:38.279 align:start position:0%
for Behavioral Health and our division
 
00:14:41.189 --> 00:14:41.199 align:start position:0%
for long-term supports and services
 
00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:42.440 align:start position:0%
without associate commissioner
 
00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:44.000 align:start position:0%
santanello here today we're going to put
 
00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:46.040 align:start position:0%
that part on hold and really focus on
 
00:14:48.949 --> 00:14:48.959 align:start position:0%
the middle I I wanted to present this
 
00:14:50.389 --> 00:14:50.399 align:start position:0%
though to know that again these things
 
00:14:53.069 --> 00:14:53.079 align:start position:0%
don't happen in isolation um we have
 
00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:54.480 align:start position:0%
work that happens in our division of
 
00:14:55.990 --> 00:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
Public Health Services which is
 
00:14:58.269 --> 00:14:58.279 align:start position:0%
preventative in nature we have work in
 
00:15:01.269 --> 00:15:01.279 align:start position:0%
our division for economic services that
 
00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:03.480 align:start position:0%
really provides the concrete supports
 
00:15:05.389 --> 00:15:05.399 align:start position:0%
that families need to stay intact and
 
00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:07.600 align:start position:0%
working together those are on the side
 
00:15:09.509 --> 00:15:09.519 align:start position:0%
for today but it's critical to think
 
00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:12.240 align:start position:0%
about each of those steps as making sure
 
00:15:13.990 --> 00:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
that we're supporting Children and Youth
 
00:15:16.069 --> 00:15:16.079 align:start position:0%
in the state and then finally across the
 
00:15:17.829 --> 00:15:17.839 align:start position:0%
bottom you're going to see Medicaid and
 
00:15:19.949 --> 00:15:19.959 align:start position:0%
we have that here there because we know
 
00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:23.440 align:start position:0%
that Medicaid is a funer of many of the
 
00:15:26.350 --> 00:15:26.360 align:start position:0%
specific Clinical Services that might be
 
00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:28.240 align:start position:0%
needed whether it's in the division for
 
00:15:29.629 --> 00:15:29.639 align:start position:0%
children youth and families or the
 
00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:31.800 align:start position:0%
division for Behavioral Health or you
 
00:15:34.030 --> 00:15:34.040 align:start position:0%
know Primary Care out in the community
 
00:15:36.430 --> 00:15:36.440 align:start position:0%
that makes kids well and whole but we
 
00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:38.560 align:start position:0%
need all of those things to be working
 
00:15:40.350 --> 00:15:40.360 align:start position:0%
together um and we really need to
 
00:15:42.629 --> 00:15:42.639 align:start position:0%
continue to integrate them across the
 
00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:46.240 align:start position:0%
way so um we can flip over to thinking a
 
00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:49.360 align:start position:0%
little bit more about um the behavioral
 
00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:51.920 align:start position:0%
health needs of kids so what we know
 
00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
right now um is that four out of 10 New
 
00:15:56.430 --> 00:15:56.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire High School students have have
 
00:15:59.069 --> 00:15:59.079 align:start position:0%
identified as feeling sad or hopeless
 
00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:01.880 align:start position:0%
that's 40 almost 40% of our kids in
 
00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
addition we had we know that about one
 
00:16:07.590 --> 00:16:07.600 align:start position:0%
out of five kids youth High School age
 
00:16:09.629 --> 00:16:09.639 align:start position:0%
youth in New Hampshire have considered
 
00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
suicide in the past year that's really
 
00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:14.800 align:start position:0%
an extraordinary number to me if I if
 
00:16:16.670 --> 00:16:16.680 align:start position:0%
you were all high school students up
 
00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:18.880 align:start position:0%
there think about what one and five
 
00:16:20.790 --> 00:16:20.800 align:start position:0%
would look like around your table and I
 
00:16:23.189 --> 00:16:23.199 align:start position:0%
think that's really startling and it
 
00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:25.560 align:start position:0%
highlights the need that we have seen
 
00:16:27.030 --> 00:16:27.040 align:start position:0%
not only here in New Hampshire but
 
00:16:29.269 --> 00:16:29.279 align:start position:0%
throughout the country around this real
 
00:16:31.829 --> 00:16:31.839 align:start position:0%
elevation of the need to address
 
00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
Children's Mental Health um across the
 
00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:36.880 align:start position:0%
Spectrum within the context of their
 
00:16:39.189 --> 00:16:39.199 align:start position:0%
families um and so that's what our
 
00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:41.440 align:start position:0%
children's Behavioral Health System Of
 
00:16:44.309 --> 00:16:44.319 align:start position:0%
Care seeks to do it seeks to work hand
 
00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
inand with families to make sure that we
 
00:16:48.949 --> 00:16:48.959 align:start position:0%
get the right K the right services for
 
00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
the right kids at the right time as we
 
00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:54.120 align:start position:0%
move forward you know the issue is
 
00:16:57.910 --> 00:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
ubiquitous across all of our um across
 
00:17:00.069 --> 00:17:00.079 align:start position:0%
our entire state it is certainly I am
 
00:17:02.269 --> 00:17:02.279 align:start position:0%
sure each of you can think right now
 
00:17:04.590 --> 00:17:04.600 align:start position:0%
that you may have a family member um
 
00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:07.520 align:start position:0%
that has a child that is has some mental
 
00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:09.480 align:start position:0%
health conditions or has some concerns
 
00:17:11.669 --> 00:17:11.679 align:start position:0%
around their behavioral health certainly
 
00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:14.160 align:start position:0%
your constituents do and we are here to
 
00:17:16.710 --> 00:17:16.720 align:start position:0%
try and help alleviate that and make
 
00:17:18.949 --> 00:17:18.959 align:start position:0%
that make the process easier for getting
 
00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:21.480 align:start position:0%
the care that kids need so as you go to
 
00:17:24.429 --> 00:17:24.439 align:start position:0%
slide six right now there's this is just
 
00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:27.160 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I I love your presentation
 
00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
I'll never remember all the questions as
 
00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:32.280 align:start position:0%
as um I see the the source of this data
 
00:17:34.669 --> 00:17:34.679 align:start position:0%
is our um youth risk behavior
 
00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:37.240 align:start position:0%
surveillance system uh and I see it's
 
00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:40.160 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire yes um do you think
 
00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:44.400 align:start position:0%
this is um significantly different from
 
00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:47.880 align:start position:0%
Maine or Vermont or Massachusetts are we
 
00:17:50.909 --> 00:17:50.919 align:start position:0%
kind of consistent as a four state area
 
00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:52.720 align:start position:0%
we are so I can't ask I don't know the
 
00:17:54.070 --> 00:17:54.080 align:start position:0%
numbers off the top of my head but I can
 
00:17:55.710 --> 00:17:55.720 align:start position:0%
tell you what I generally think and I
 
00:17:57.190 --> 00:17:57.200 align:start position:0%
can certainly follow up with the exact
 
00:17:59.270 --> 00:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
numbers for you this has been an issue
 
00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:01.200 align:start position:0%
through the pandemic many of us heard in
 
00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:05.400 align:start position:0%
2021 and in 2023 the increase of the
 
00:18:07.789 --> 00:18:07.799 align:start position:0%
need around children's Behavioral Health
 
00:18:10.270 --> 00:18:10.280 align:start position:0%
the good it really peaked in 21 during
 
00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:12.240 align:start position:0%
the middle of the pandemic it inched
 
00:18:14.990 --> 00:18:15.000 align:start position:0%
down just a little bit in 2023 and this
 
00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:17.240 align:start position:0%
was consistent around the country New
 
00:18:19.390 --> 00:18:19.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire tends to report some of these
 
00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:21.720 align:start position:0%
things higher than other states but I
 
00:18:23.470 --> 00:18:23.480 align:start position:0%
can't tell you if it's significantly
 
00:18:25.789 --> 00:18:25.799 align:start position:0%
different okay and just so you know I'm
 
00:18:28.390 --> 00:18:28.400 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm I'm more interested in gen in
 
00:18:32.350 --> 00:18:32.360 align:start position:0%
general en how uh our information
 
00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:34.200 align:start position:0%
correlates with the other states this
 
00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:36.400 align:start position:0%
just was an example where I could ask
 
00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:39.080 align:start position:0%
the question but I'm I'm not interested
 
00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:41.600 align:start position:0%
really in in this one point sure but
 
00:18:44.110 --> 00:18:44.120 align:start position:0%
just sort of the general uh uh
 
00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:46.360 align:start position:0%
comparable I and I would say that
 
00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:48.240 align:start position:0%
nationally children's behavioral health
 
00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:50.320 align:start position:0%
concerns are on the rise that's where I
 
00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:52.960 align:start position:0%
would end that and similarly in the New
 
00:18:55.630 --> 00:18:55.640 align:start position:0%
England area all right thank you you're
 
00:18:59.710 --> 00:18:59.720 align:start position:0%
welcome so we we look at slide six
 
00:19:02.549 --> 00:19:02.559 align:start position:0%
may I ask a follow-up question yours so
 
00:19:04.669 --> 00:19:04.679 align:start position:0%
the the trend line
 
00:19:08.110 --> 00:19:08.120 align:start position:0%
preco versus now easing into a post
 
00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:11.960 align:start position:0%
postco uh period what did that look like
 
00:19:13.470 --> 00:19:13.480 align:start position:0%
where you say four out of 10 was what
 
00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:15.880 align:start position:0%
was that number pre-co so it was
 
00:19:18.430 --> 00:19:18.440 align:start position:0%
probably closer to three out of 10 you
 
00:19:19.909 --> 00:19:19.919 align:start position:0%
know like it was three or less in the
 
00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:22.240 align:start position:0%
30s to 20s again I can get that data for
 
00:19:24.149 --> 00:19:24.159 align:start position:0%
you later on and look at that trend line
 
00:19:28.149 --> 00:19:28.159 align:start position:0%
it peaked up in 2021 it has slid down a
 
00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:31.080 align:start position:0%
little bit in 2023 and currently we're
 
00:19:33.029 --> 00:19:33.039 align:start position:0%
cap we capture this data every 2 years
 
00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:34.640 align:start position:0%
we're in the middle of capturing it for
 
00:19:39.230 --> 00:19:39.240 align:start position:0%
2025 now thank you thank you thank you
 
00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:42.720 align:start position:0%
great so slide six a little visual here
 
00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:44.760 align:start position:0%
so really describes what are we doing
 
00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:46.400 align:start position:0%
about this what are we doing about this
 
00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
concern that we have in our communities
 
00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:52.320 align:start position:0%
and so we have put together um and when
 
00:19:55.310 --> 00:19:55.320 align:start position:0%
I say we I really mean the general court
 
00:19:56.990 --> 00:19:57.000 align:start position:0%
as well as the Department of Health and
 
00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
Human Services has put together a suite
 
00:20:04.029 --> 00:20:04.039 align:start position:0%
of interventions and legislation policy
 
00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:06.760 align:start position:0%
and importantly financial investments
 
00:20:09.310 --> 00:20:09.320 align:start position:0%
this is the the fiscal committee to
 
00:20:12.350 --> 00:20:12.360 align:start position:0%
understand that um to address this
 
00:20:14.430 --> 00:20:14.440 align:start position:0%
problem from many different angles so
 
00:20:17.149 --> 00:20:17.159 align:start position:0%
starting over 10 years ago now you know
 
00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:20.520 align:start position:0%
back in 2012 we the department received
 
00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:22.240 align:start position:0%
some federal funding to start thinking
 
00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:25.360 align:start position:0%
about what would a system of care look
 
00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:28.720 align:start position:0%
like for children in New Hampshire so
 
00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:30.760 align:start position:0%
again not Individual Services thought
 
00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:32.640 align:start position:0%
about in you know nice discreet little
 
00:20:34.750 --> 00:20:34.760 align:start position:0%
buckets but really how do we think about
 
00:20:36.789 --> 00:20:36.799 align:start position:0%
this in a systemic way so we started
 
00:20:38.669 --> 00:20:38.679 align:start position:0%
that planning back in
 
00:20:41.549 --> 00:20:41.559 align:start position:0%
2012 we added the department of Ed to
 
00:20:44.990 --> 00:20:45.000 align:start position:0%
that work we added different components
 
00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:48.440 align:start position:0%
by 2019 we developed the Department's um
 
00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:51.080 align:start position:0%
10-year mental health plan that was the
 
00:20:53.909 --> 00:20:53.919 align:start position:0%
first time we had ever included children
 
00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:56.080 align:start position:0%
in a mental health plan so up you know
 
00:20:58.070 --> 00:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
less than 10 years ago is the first time
 
00:20:59.950 --> 00:20:59.960 align:start position:0%
that that state had ever really
 
00:21:01.310 --> 00:21:01.320 align:start position:0%
considered that kids might be an
 
00:21:03.549 --> 00:21:03.559 align:start position:0%
important play in there and then from
 
00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:05.720 align:start position:0%
then you'll see a suite of additional
 
00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
legislation really creating this system
 
00:21:11.430 --> 00:21:11.440 align:start position:0%
of care and importantly in here and I
 
00:21:13.269 --> 00:21:13.279 align:start position:0%
think one of the critical elements as we
 
00:21:14.789 --> 00:21:14.799 align:start position:0%
think about the other parts of my
 
00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:17.480 align:start position:0%
presentation later on around YDC and
 
00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
Juvenile Justice we made an important
 
00:21:22.710 --> 00:21:22.720 align:start position:0%
distinction in 2022 in the middle of the
 
00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:25.200 align:start position:0%
pandemic that we needed to transform our
 
00:21:27.630 --> 00:21:27.640 align:start position:0%
Juvenile Justice work and that's
 
00:21:29.070 --> 00:21:29.080 align:start position:0%
critically important because what we
 
00:21:31.390 --> 00:21:31.400 align:start position:0%
were seeing was kids with behavioral
 
00:21:34.669 --> 00:21:34.679 align:start position:0%
health issues Landing in essentially a
 
00:21:37.710 --> 00:21:37.720 align:start position:0%
law enforcement pun punitive system
 
00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:39.240 align:start position:0%
rather than getting the care that they
 
00:21:41.390 --> 00:21:41.400 align:start position:0%
need and so that's to me just a
 
00:21:43.310 --> 00:21:43.320 align:start position:0%
highlight as we go on and we have done
 
00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:44.880 align:start position:0%
some extraordinary work that I can talk
 
00:21:48.149 --> 00:21:48.159 align:start position:0%
a little bit more about later on around
 
00:21:50.590 --> 00:21:50.600 align:start position:0%
rethinking the way we think about
 
00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:52.760 align:start position:0%
Juvenile Justice and making sure that
 
00:21:54.990 --> 00:21:55.000 align:start position:0%
we're supporting kids and not just
 
00:21:57.510 --> 00:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
putting them into a secure facility on
 
00:21:59.750 --> 00:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
the first blush the first interaction
 
00:22:01.990 --> 00:22:02.000 align:start position:0%
with law enforcement it really changes
 
00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:04.000 align:start position:0%
the way that we do work and I will also
 
00:22:06.590 --> 00:22:06.600 align:start position:0%
note that it is also often times less
 
00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:09.360 align:start position:0%
expensive to address those issues early
 
00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:12.640 align:start position:0%
on we've um had some additional um
 
00:22:14.990 --> 00:22:15.000 align:start position:0%
legislation even last year again
 
00:22:18.149 --> 00:22:18.159 align:start position:0%
thinking about how we strengthen this um
 
00:22:20.510 --> 00:22:20.520 align:start position:0%
this system of care so if we go to the
 
00:22:23.310 --> 00:22:23.320 align:start position:0%
next slide which is slide seven this is
 
00:22:25.710 --> 00:22:25.720 align:start position:0%
a you you said you only were going to
 
00:22:29.070 --> 00:22:29.080 align:start position:0%
take an hour yeah I move so with me it's
 
00:22:31.029 --> 00:22:31.039 align:start position:0%
going to be like two hours because this
 
00:22:36.269 --> 00:22:36.279 align:start position:0%
is so good um HP 1573 and
 
00:22:39.710 --> 00:22:39.720 align:start position:0%
sb47 I I don't recall the numbers I just
 
00:22:42.549 --> 00:22:42.559 align:start position:0%
recall the the the legislative
 
00:22:45.669 --> 00:22:45.679 align:start position:0%
discussion around this um there was a
 
00:22:49.310 --> 00:22:49.320 align:start position:0%
fairly significant uh recommended
 
00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:53.360 align:start position:0%
increase to um the amount of inspections
 
00:22:56.230 --> 00:22:56.240 align:start position:0%
and followup related to outof State
 
00:22:58.950 --> 00:22:58.960 align:start position:0%
placements yes and and I know know that
 
00:23:00.909 --> 00:23:00.919 align:start position:0%
the policy committee and the finance
 
00:23:03.669 --> 00:23:03.679 align:start position:0%
committee had different views and then
 
00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:06.520 align:start position:0%
it went uh off into Committee of
 
00:23:08.909 --> 00:23:08.919 align:start position:0%
conference stuff and I think I lost
 
00:23:11.870 --> 00:23:11.880 align:start position:0%
track of it so so what would be nice is
 
00:23:15.430 --> 00:23:15.440 align:start position:0%
not today but if whoever understands
 
00:23:18.149 --> 00:23:18.159 align:start position:0%
what our commitment is stat from a
 
00:23:21.269 --> 00:23:21.279 align:start position:0%
statutory perspective around the out of
 
00:23:24.190 --> 00:23:24.200 align:start position:0%
state um inspections and Audits and
 
00:23:26.430 --> 00:23:26.440 align:start position:0%
everything I i' I'd like to just be
 
00:23:28.190 --> 00:23:28.200 align:start position:0%
reminded and that could be a phone call
 
00:23:30.190 --> 00:23:30.200 align:start position:0%
or something happy to do that the short
 
00:23:32.669 --> 00:23:32.679 align:start position:0%
answer is we are putting boots on the
 
00:23:36.110 --> 00:23:36.120 align:start position:0%
ground eyes and ears into residential um
 
00:23:38.110 --> 00:23:38.120 align:start position:0%
systems and providing more quality
 
00:23:40.110 --> 00:23:40.120 align:start position:0%
oversight there's a financial component
 
00:23:41.789 --> 00:23:41.799 align:start position:0%
that when you send people on airplanes
 
00:23:43.549 --> 00:23:43.559 align:start position:0%
when you go driving around New Hampshire
 
00:23:45.510 --> 00:23:45.520 align:start position:0%
to those residential places that costs
 
00:23:47.549 --> 00:23:47.559 align:start position:0%
money of our state to do that so of our
 
00:23:49.470 --> 00:23:49.480 align:start position:0%
state employees so we that was the
 
00:23:50.830 --> 00:23:50.840 align:start position:0%
investment that was made by the general
 
00:23:52.789 --> 00:23:52.799 align:start position:0%
court to say it is important to us to
 
00:23:55.110 --> 00:23:55.120 align:start position:0%
put eyes and ears in those facilities
 
00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
and then we're working closely with the
 
00:23:58.190 --> 00:23:58.200 align:start position:0%
office of the child advocate to make
 
00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
sure we're asking the right questions so
 
00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:01.200 align:start position:0%
that's the short version but I can give
 
00:24:02.470 --> 00:24:02.480 align:start position:0%
you a longer version so we're going to
 
00:24:04.430 --> 00:24:04.440 align:start position:0%
probably have to revisit that in this
 
00:24:07.149 --> 00:24:07.159 align:start position:0%
budget cycle so maybe maybe instead of
 
00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:09.360 align:start position:0%
over the phone we probably need to
 
00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:12.840 align:start position:0%
arrange like a a a 20 30 minute uh
 
00:24:15.630 --> 00:24:15.640 align:start position:0%
presentation on that particular subject
 
00:24:17.190 --> 00:24:17.200 align:start position:0%
happy to do that could could you add
 
00:24:21.350 --> 00:24:21.360 align:start position:0%
that to the the to to-do list Mr Ripple
 
00:24:25.070 --> 00:24:25.080 align:start position:0%
okay and because that's going to involve
 
00:24:27.750 --> 00:24:27.760 align:start position:0%
numbers um we probably have to do it
 
00:24:30.750 --> 00:24:30.760 align:start position:0%
after the Governor's budget is released
 
00:24:33.870 --> 00:24:33.880 align:start position:0%
okay than thank you yeah absolutely so
 
00:24:36.029 --> 00:24:36.039 align:start position:0%
um I'm trying to do my best to keep you
 
00:24:37.630 --> 00:24:37.640 align:start position:0%
out of here in an hour but no you're
 
00:24:39.870 --> 00:24:39.880 align:start position:0%
great you're great you're you're you're
 
00:24:41.430 --> 00:24:41.440 align:start position:0%
you're making us smarter you're giving
 
00:24:44.149 --> 00:24:44.159 align:start position:0%
us information I need for sure so so
 
00:24:46.110 --> 00:24:46.120 align:start position:0%
let's just keep we'll keep going all
 
00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
right all right so as you switch to
 
00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
slide seven this is what we often show
 
00:24:53.029 --> 00:24:53.039 align:start position:0%
as the Children's behavor Health System
 
00:24:55.110 --> 00:24:55.120 align:start position:0%
Of Care framework it's a circle it's got
 
00:24:57.710 --> 00:24:57.720 align:start position:0%
these little pies it's got tears we love
 
00:25:00.070 --> 00:25:00.080 align:start position:0%
this in ocracy we love making little
 
00:25:02.269 --> 00:25:02.279 align:start position:0%
little figures for you that say tier one
 
00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
tier two but I think it's really helpful
 
00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:06.880 align:start position:0%
for you to understand that um this
 
00:25:09.310 --> 00:25:09.320 align:start position:0%
system of care while we often think
 
00:25:13.669 --> 00:25:13.679 align:start position:0%
about tier five tier four very expensive
 
00:25:17.070 --> 00:25:17.080 align:start position:0%
High need acute care psychiatric care
 
00:25:19.950 --> 00:25:19.960 align:start position:0%
Residential Treatment the entire system
 
00:25:22.029 --> 00:25:22.039 align:start position:0%
is predicated on thinking about those
 
00:25:25.230 --> 00:25:25.240 align:start position:0%
earlier tiar as well making sure that um
 
00:25:27.710 --> 00:25:27.720 align:start position:0%
kids in families every you know every
 
00:25:29.590 --> 00:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
one of our kids kids have the sort of
 
00:25:31.870 --> 00:25:31.880 align:start position:0%
Assessments and screening and treatment
 
00:25:33.750 --> 00:25:33.760 align:start position:0%
that they get within weal child visits
 
00:25:36.190 --> 00:25:36.200 align:start position:0%
with their families um making sure that
 
00:25:38.070 --> 00:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
there are community-based services that
 
00:25:40.710 --> 00:25:40.720 align:start position:0%
are close to home easy to access for
 
00:25:43.710 --> 00:25:43.720 align:start position:0%
families to engage in and then you start
 
00:25:45.430 --> 00:25:45.440 align:start position:0%
inching up into some of the more
 
00:25:47.710 --> 00:25:47.720 align:start position:0%
intensive need Services the service
 
00:25:49.870 --> 00:25:49.880 align:start position:0%
array includes a lot of things it
 
00:25:52.350 --> 00:25:52.360 align:start position:0%
includes those you know again going for
 
00:25:54.590 --> 00:25:54.600 align:start position:0%
your well baby's visit just to make sure
 
00:25:57.029 --> 00:25:57.039 align:start position:0%
your child's well child visit just to
 
00:25:59.710 --> 00:25:59.720 align:start position:0%
make sure things are going okay all the
 
00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
way up to intensive crisis response and
 
00:26:06.110 --> 00:26:06.120 align:start position:0%
stabilization Soup To Nuts as we flip
 
00:26:09.230 --> 00:26:09.240 align:start position:0%
over though to slide eight I think one
 
00:26:11.029 --> 00:26:11.039 align:start position:0%
of the ways I've been thinking about it
 
00:26:13.190 --> 00:26:13.200 align:start position:0%
while I love that Circle that clearly
 
00:26:15.310 --> 00:26:15.320 align:start position:0%
defines each of those tears and that
 
00:26:17.269 --> 00:26:17.279 align:start position:0%
they they go around each other and we've
 
00:26:20.070 --> 00:26:20.080 align:start position:0%
got rapid response when there's a crisis
 
00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:22.440 align:start position:0%
for me what it highlights is that to
 
00:26:24.990 --> 00:26:25.000 align:start position:0%
often we have spent most of our
 
00:26:27.789 --> 00:26:27.799 align:start position:0%
resources and a great deal of our time
 
00:26:30.549 --> 00:26:30.559 align:start position:0%
thinking about those high cost areas
 
00:26:33.110 --> 00:26:33.120 align:start position:0%
those incred incredibly important acute
 
00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
need services that are out of home and
 
00:26:38.430 --> 00:26:38.440 align:start position:0%
in residential and we have spent less
 
00:26:41.590 --> 00:26:41.600 align:start position:0%
time and energy focusing on the lower
 
00:26:44.269 --> 00:26:44.279 align:start position:0%
intensity services that we would hope
 
00:26:46.549 --> 00:26:46.559 align:start position:0%
could actually reduce the number of kids
 
00:26:48.950 --> 00:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
that ultimately need those High acute
 
00:26:51.149 --> 00:26:51.159 align:start position:0%
Services we are never going to get that
 
00:26:53.549 --> 00:26:53.559 align:start position:0%
number to zero there are always going to
 
00:26:55.990 --> 00:26:56.000 align:start position:0%
be children for whatever reason that may
 
00:26:58.350 --> 00:26:58.360 align:start position:0%
have a condition a me a medical
 
00:27:00.350 --> 00:27:00.360 align:start position:0%
condition that may need them that may
 
00:27:02.750 --> 00:27:02.760 align:start position:0%
lead them or may more likely lead them
 
00:27:05.110 --> 00:27:05.120 align:start position:0%
to need those Services we also have
 
00:27:07.470 --> 00:27:07.480 align:start position:0%
youth that experience great trauma as
 
00:27:10.630 --> 00:27:10.640 align:start position:0%
well and so that may you know exacerbate
 
00:27:12.310 --> 00:27:12.320 align:start position:0%
their need for those higher Acuity
 
00:27:15.110 --> 00:27:15.120 align:start position:0%
services but I do think firmly believe
 
00:27:18.190 --> 00:27:18.200 align:start position:0%
we have an opportunity to um and my my
 
00:27:19.750 --> 00:27:19.760 align:start position:0%
colleagues hate when I say this walk
 
00:27:21.710 --> 00:27:21.720 align:start position:0%
into you gum at the same time here we
 
00:27:24.310 --> 00:27:24.320 align:start position:0%
need to think about the preventative
 
00:27:26.549 --> 00:27:26.559 align:start position:0%
stuff building early making sure that
 
00:27:29.230 --> 00:27:29.240 align:start position:0%
we've got strong supports as well as
 
00:27:31.389 --> 00:27:31.399 align:start position:0%
making sure that we're have the best
 
00:27:33.230 --> 00:27:33.240 align:start position:0%
highest quality of care for those who
 
00:27:36.510 --> 00:27:36.520 align:start position:0%
need the most intensive services and so
 
00:27:38.389 --> 00:27:38.399 align:start position:0%
that's what this is really looking at is
 
00:27:41.070 --> 00:27:41.080 align:start position:0%
this flip-flop of the of the pyramid we
 
00:27:43.230 --> 00:27:43.240 align:start position:0%
spent a lot of money and a lot of time
 
00:27:45.190 --> 00:27:45.200 align:start position:0%
thinking about those relatively few
 
00:27:48.310 --> 00:27:48.320 align:start position:0%
number of Youth and not as much money
 
00:27:50.710 --> 00:27:50.720 align:start position:0%
and time thinking of ensuring that we've
 
00:27:53.190 --> 00:27:53.200 align:start position:0%
got the community- Based Services that
 
00:27:55.870 --> 00:27:55.880 align:start position:0%
kind of keep kiddos out of that higher
 
00:27:57.830 --> 00:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
need and so I like to think about it as
 
00:28:00.110 --> 00:28:00.120 align:start position:0%
the way in that triangle is how can we
 
00:28:03.310 --> 00:28:03.320 align:start position:0%
get closer to that knowing that the piie
 
00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:05.600 align:start position:0%
is unlikely to get bigger you know the
 
00:28:07.710 --> 00:28:07.720 align:start position:0%
amount of money is unlikely to get
 
00:28:09.710 --> 00:28:09.720 align:start position:0%
bigger certainly in a budget season like
 
00:28:13.110 --> 00:28:13.120 align:start position:0%
this and so how do we use what we have
 
00:28:15.029 --> 00:28:15.039 align:start position:0%
to sort of move in there it's
 
00:28:17.310 --> 00:28:17.320 align:start position:0%
aspirational but it is something I think
 
00:28:19.389 --> 00:28:19.399 align:start position:0%
is worth disc to thinking
 
00:28:22.509 --> 00:28:22.519 align:start position:0%
about um I'll go to representative wner
 
00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:26.760 align:start position:0%
here in a second I I I think I think um
 
00:28:29.909 --> 00:28:29.919 align:start position:0%
paradoxically we may be a uh in in some
 
00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:33.360 align:start position:0%
ways a victim of our own success uh as a
 
00:28:36.990 --> 00:28:37.000 align:start position:0%
state we have an extremely low per
 
00:28:40.909 --> 00:28:40.919 align:start position:0%
capita uh number of kids in um
 
00:28:43.590 --> 00:28:43.600 align:start position:0%
Residential Services uh we we're like
 
00:28:45.870 --> 00:28:45.880 align:start position:0%
first or second I think depending on
 
00:28:49.070 --> 00:28:49.080 align:start position:0%
what I remember from Mr ribson uh uh
 
00:28:52.509 --> 00:28:52.519 align:start position:0%
commentary and so so I I although I love
 
00:28:55.630 --> 00:28:55.640 align:start position:0%
the theory of of flipping this and
 
00:28:58.669 --> 00:28:58.679 align:start position:0%
investing more in lower intensity Serv
 
00:29:01.509 --> 00:29:01.519 align:start position:0%
Services aren't we ar aren't we going to
 
00:29:04.470 --> 00:29:04.480 align:start position:0%
be going out and strictly on Theory uh
 
00:29:06.389 --> 00:29:06.399 align:start position:0%
we don't really have any other states to
 
00:29:08.669 --> 00:29:08.679 align:start position:0%
go look at to see what their experience
 
00:29:11.230 --> 00:29:11.240 align:start position:0%
was or or or do we have other states
 
00:29:12.590 --> 00:29:12.600 align:start position:0%
there are other states that have done
 
00:29:14.350 --> 00:29:14.360 align:start position:0%
this work New Jersey is a great example
 
00:29:16.430 --> 00:29:16.440 align:start position:0%
if anyone remembers director ribson he
 
00:29:17.990 --> 00:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
would always start every sentence with
 
00:29:20.830 --> 00:29:20.840 align:start position:0%
back in New Jersey um and but there are
 
00:29:22.950 --> 00:29:22.960 align:start position:0%
places like New Jersey other states
 
00:29:24.630 --> 00:29:24.640 align:start position:0%
we're actually you know you're skipping
 
00:29:26.029 --> 00:29:26.039 align:start position:0%
to the end you've already read to the
 
00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:28.320 align:start position:0%
middle of my presentation we're actually
 
00:29:30.549 --> 00:29:30.559 align:start position:0%
involved in an assessment right now to
 
00:29:32.149 --> 00:29:32.159 align:start position:0%
look at some of those other states to
 
00:29:34.990 --> 00:29:35.000 align:start position:0%
see um what can be we can transfer to
 
00:29:37.149 --> 00:29:37.159 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire okay I I'm totally
 
00:29:38.990 --> 00:29:39.000 align:start position:0%
supportive of the theory I'm just
 
00:29:41.470 --> 00:29:41.480 align:start position:0%
curious about our ability to leverage
 
00:29:43.310 --> 00:29:43.320 align:start position:0%
the experience of others and it sounds
 
00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:46.640 align:start position:0%
like we can that is my hope okay
 
00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:48.630 align:start position:0%
like we can that is my hope okay
representative

00:29:48.630 --> 00:29:48.640 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:29:50.710 --> 00:29:50.720 align:start position:0%
walner thank you that was sort of where
 
00:29:53.070 --> 00:29:53.080 align:start position:0%
I was going I wanted to know if at some
 
00:29:56.190 --> 00:29:56.200 align:start position:0%
point during the next few weeks when
 
00:29:58.029 --> 00:29:58.039 align:start position:0%
we'll spend a lot of time together
 
00:30:01.549 --> 00:30:01.559 align:start position:0%
probably you'll talk about what kinds of
 
00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:05.360 align:start position:0%
preventive programs and you know how do
 
00:30:07.789 --> 00:30:07.799 align:start position:0%
you how do you develop those do we have
 
00:30:11.149 --> 00:30:11.159 align:start position:0%
models we can copy and really really
 
00:30:13.750 --> 00:30:13.760 align:start position:0%
telling us about the programs yes yes I
 
00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:15.360 align:start position:0%
won't have time to do that today but I
 
00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:16.960 align:start position:0%
think that's a great question and I'll
 
00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:19.120 align:start position:0%
I'll preface that by saying one of the
 
00:30:22.110 --> 00:30:22.120 align:start position:0%
great things when um you know director
 
00:30:24.909 --> 00:30:24.919 align:start position:0%
um ribson was here he brought a lot of
 
00:30:27.029 --> 00:30:27.039 align:start position:0%
those community-based services to the
 
00:30:30.669 --> 00:30:30.679 align:start position:0%
dcyf work and um what we're trying to
 
00:30:32.389 --> 00:30:32.399 align:start position:0%
understand now the work that we have
 
00:30:34.430 --> 00:30:34.440 align:start position:0%
today is really understand which one of
 
00:30:36.110 --> 00:30:36.120 align:start position:0%
those makes the biggest difference you
 
00:30:38.990 --> 00:30:39.000 align:start position:0%
know we brought a great uh menu that
 
00:30:40.789 --> 00:30:40.799 align:start position:0%
we're selecting from and we have a
 
00:30:43.190 --> 00:30:43.200 align:start position:0%
couple years under our belt to
 
00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
understand what's working and what isn't
 
00:30:47.350 --> 00:30:47.360 align:start position:0%
working we also can look to the National
 
00:30:49.389 --> 00:30:49.399 align:start position:0%
evidence as well we can look to things
 
00:30:51.470 --> 00:30:51.480 align:start position:0%
like our home visiting programs that are
 
00:30:53.830 --> 00:30:53.840 align:start position:0%
completely primary prevention and we
 
00:30:55.909 --> 00:30:55.919 align:start position:0%
know that some programs are better than
 
00:30:58.350 --> 00:30:58.360 align:start position:0%
other programs according to the evidence
 
00:31:00.430 --> 00:31:00.440 align:start position:0%
you know from National Data so things
 
00:31:02.070 --> 00:31:02.080 align:start position:0%
like our Healthy Families America
 
00:31:04.310 --> 00:31:04.320 align:start position:0%
program is an incredibly strong
 
00:31:06.230 --> 00:31:06.240 align:start position:0%
evidence-based program about keeping
 
00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:08.240 align:start position:0%
kids out of the child welfare system by
 
00:31:10.750 --> 00:31:10.760 align:start position:0%
supporting moms and their babies early
 
00:31:13.430 --> 00:31:13.440 align:start position:0%
on we can keep them out and we've added
 
00:31:16.029 --> 00:31:16.039 align:start position:0%
on to that even now a special cohort
 
00:31:18.509 --> 00:31:18.519 align:start position:0%
around um home visiting that's connected
 
00:31:20.750 --> 00:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
with DCF for families who may have
 
00:31:22.509 --> 00:31:22.519 align:start position:0%
already dipped their toe a little bit
 
00:31:24.549 --> 00:31:24.559 align:start position:0%
into the DCF system and we don't want
 
00:31:28.669 --> 00:31:28.679 align:start position:0%
them to go any farther thank you
 
00:31:31.950 --> 00:31:31.960 align:start position:0%
so if we switch over to um slide nine
 
00:31:33.750 --> 00:31:33.760 align:start position:0%
how do we pay for this you know this is
 
00:31:36.269 --> 00:31:36.279 align:start position:0%
a great question and I appreciate the
 
00:31:38.110 --> 00:31:38.120 align:start position:0%
the challenge that is in front of all of
 
00:31:39.590 --> 00:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
us that's in front of you all that's in
 
00:31:41.470 --> 00:31:41.480 align:start position:0%
front of us at the department knowing
 
00:31:43.590 --> 00:31:43.600 align:start position:0%
that we have fewer resources we have
 
00:31:45.669 --> 00:31:45.679 align:start position:0%
been flush over the past few years we've
 
00:31:48.149 --> 00:31:48.159 align:start position:0%
had an influx of federal dollars to be
 
00:31:51.990 --> 00:31:52.000 align:start position:0%
able to test new things um I would never
 
00:31:53.990 --> 00:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
want another pandemic but that was one
 
00:31:55.830 --> 00:31:55.840 align:start position:0%
of the only Silver Linings that it came
 
00:31:57.389 --> 00:31:57.399 align:start position:0%
with was an opportunity to have some
 
00:31:59.470 --> 00:31:59.480 align:start position:0%
additional federal funds to our
 
00:32:01.789 --> 00:32:01.799 align:start position:0%
advantage um and so it's enable us to
 
00:32:03.310 --> 00:32:03.320 align:start position:0%
get things some things stood up
 
00:32:04.909 --> 00:32:04.919 align:start position:0%
including within our children's system
 
00:32:07.190 --> 00:32:07.200 align:start position:0%
of care and if we think about this model
 
00:32:09.070 --> 00:32:09.080 align:start position:0%
right here um what I would love for you
 
00:32:10.830 --> 00:32:10.840 align:start position:0%
to take away from this is the fact that
 
00:32:13.070 --> 00:32:13.080 align:start position:0%
there's no One Singular funding source
 
00:32:15.269 --> 00:32:15.279 align:start position:0%
for for almost anything we think about
 
00:32:16.710 --> 00:32:16.720 align:start position:0%
our community mental health centers
 
00:32:19.029 --> 00:32:19.039 align:start position:0%
where kids with serious emotional um
 
00:32:21.590 --> 00:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
issues can get care we we use both
 
00:32:24.389 --> 00:32:24.399 align:start position:0%
Federal and general funds we have funds
 
00:32:26.029 --> 00:32:26.039 align:start position:0%
that are budgeted within our division
 
00:32:28.070 --> 00:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
for Behavioral Health that are General
 
00:32:30.149 --> 00:32:30.159 align:start position:0%
funds we also have operational funds
 
00:32:31.909 --> 00:32:31.919 align:start position:0%
through Medicaid same thing with our
 
00:32:34.389 --> 00:32:34.399 align:start position:0%
Care Management entities which is one of
 
00:32:35.990 --> 00:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
those strategies that we brought in a
 
00:32:38.269 --> 00:32:38.279 align:start position:0%
few years ago to address the needs and
 
00:32:40.669 --> 00:32:40.679 align:start position:0%
coordination of those very uh of those
 
00:32:43.470 --> 00:32:43.480 align:start position:0%
kids with other incredibly complex needs
 
00:32:46.430 --> 00:32:46.440 align:start position:0%
we put in federal and general funds to
 
00:32:48.310 --> 00:32:48.320 align:start position:0%
make that work we think about
 
00:32:49.950 --> 00:32:49.960 align:start position:0%
Residential Treatment this is a place
 
00:32:52.430 --> 00:32:52.440 align:start position:0%
where some of the most complex Finance
 
00:32:54.230 --> 00:32:54.240 align:start position:0%
happens because we have to piece
 
00:32:56.950 --> 00:32:56.960 align:start position:0%
together a number of different funding
 
00:32:59.590 --> 00:32:59.600 align:start position:0%
sources sometimes pieces of it can be
 
00:33:01.750 --> 00:33:01.760 align:start position:0%
paid for with Medicaid sometimes it
 
00:33:04.029 --> 00:33:04.039 align:start position:0%
can't it depends on the child you might
 
00:33:06.230 --> 00:33:06.240 align:start position:0%
be able to use a little tanif sometimes
 
00:33:08.789 --> 00:33:08.799 align:start position:0%
you can't if the child is in residential
 
00:33:10.230 --> 00:33:10.240 align:start position:0%
care and and they need to have their
 
00:33:12.149 --> 00:33:12.159 align:start position:0%
educational needs met the school
 
00:33:14.549 --> 00:33:14.559 align:start position:0%
district may also throw in a little bit
 
00:33:15.990 --> 00:33:16.000 align:start position:0%
and so this is one of the most
 
00:33:18.549 --> 00:33:18.559 align:start position:0%
complicated pieces for luckily a very
 
00:33:21.509 --> 00:33:21.519 align:start position:0%
small number of of kids um but it's
 
00:33:23.350 --> 00:33:23.360 align:start position:0%
where we're putting everything into the
 
00:33:25.990 --> 00:33:26.000 align:start position:0%
pie and trying to make um in trying to
 
00:33:28.669 --> 00:33:28.679 align:start position:0%
make our dollars uh be Ive and also
 
00:33:30.230 --> 00:33:30.240 align:start position:0%
everyone has a little bit of skin in the
 
00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:32.760 align:start position:0%
game um and then of course our other
 
00:33:35.190 --> 00:33:35.200 align:start position:0%
community based providers are sometimes
 
00:33:36.830 --> 00:33:36.840 align:start position:0%
you know where it is appropriate we can
 
00:33:39.269 --> 00:33:39.279 align:start position:0%
use Medicaid for operational work
 
00:33:41.389 --> 00:33:41.399 align:start position:0%
sometimes that's not appropriate because
 
00:33:44.190 --> 00:33:44.200 align:start position:0%
it's not a medical condition um and
 
00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
that's where we also use a mix of
 
00:33:48.710 --> 00:33:48.720 align:start position:0%
federal and general funds so as we move
 
00:33:52.070 --> 00:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
through um I think it's important and I
 
00:33:54.029 --> 00:33:54.039 align:start position:0%
I feel a little bit like I'm on repeat
 
00:33:55.950 --> 00:33:55.960 align:start position:0%
on this but how do we measure the
 
00:33:57.470 --> 00:33:57.480 align:start position:0%
success on this and the first thing we
 
00:34:00.350 --> 00:34:00.360 align:start position:0%
need to realize is that 95% of our kids
 
00:34:02.190 --> 00:34:02.200 align:start position:0%
are served in community- based settings
 
00:34:04.549 --> 00:34:04.559 align:start position:0%
we talk a lot historically and and
 
00:34:06.430 --> 00:34:06.440 align:start position:0%
certainly over the past couple sessions
 
00:34:08.069 --> 00:34:08.079 align:start position:0%
here at the legislature we've
 
00:34:09.710 --> 00:34:09.720 align:start position:0%
appropriately talked a lot about
 
00:34:11.710 --> 00:34:11.720 align:start position:0%
residential care we have some things
 
00:34:14.790 --> 00:34:14.800 align:start position:0%
that we needed to fix um but really
 
00:34:16.710 --> 00:34:16.720 align:start position:0%
where we can get the most bang for our
 
00:34:19.310 --> 00:34:19.320 align:start position:0%
buck is ensuring that those kids that
 
00:34:21.470 --> 00:34:21.480 align:start position:0%
are in communitybased settings are
 
00:34:23.349 --> 00:34:23.359 align:start position:0%
getting the appropriate care that they
 
00:34:26.069 --> 00:34:26.079 align:start position:0%
need so that things don't escalate and
 
00:34:28.109 --> 00:34:28.119 align:start position:0%
so that means that we have work that we
 
00:34:30.069 --> 00:34:30.079 align:start position:0%
do around quality assurance with our
 
00:34:32.790 --> 00:34:32.800 align:start position:0%
contractors we have work to make sure
 
00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
that they are um that there's Fidelity
 
00:34:37.069 --> 00:34:37.079 align:start position:0%
to some of those evidence-based
 
00:34:39.470 --> 00:34:39.480 align:start position:0%
standards both clinical as well as some
 
00:34:41.909 --> 00:34:41.919 align:start position:0%
of the programs like home visiting so we
 
00:34:43.829 --> 00:34:43.839 align:start position:0%
make sure that folks are you know that
 
00:34:46.349 --> 00:34:46.359 align:start position:0%
there's some there's some um science
 
00:34:48.069 --> 00:34:48.079 align:start position:0%
behind the work that we do and that
 
00:34:50.790 --> 00:34:50.800 align:start position:0%
they're working closely uh and they're
 
00:34:53.550 --> 00:34:53.560 align:start position:0%
have Fidelity to those models but to me
 
00:34:55.710 --> 00:34:55.720 align:start position:0%
the most important thing on this list is
 
00:34:57.109 --> 00:34:57.119 align:start position:0%
looking at the Improvement in youth
 
00:34:58.910 --> 00:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
functioning and so we have done this
 
00:35:01.230 --> 00:35:01.240 align:start position:0%
one-on-one with kids a lot you know we
 
00:35:03.670 --> 00:35:03.680 align:start position:0%
have a standardized assessment tool
 
00:35:05.230 --> 00:35:05.240 align:start position:0%
that's something we've put in over the
 
00:35:07.270 --> 00:35:07.280 align:start position:0%
past few years so we can actually
 
00:35:09.750 --> 00:35:09.760 align:start position:0%
measure how well the kids are doing over
 
00:35:12.390 --> 00:35:12.400 align:start position:0%
time we use the same tool over time and
 
00:35:14.150 --> 00:35:14.160 align:start position:0%
you can see if kids are getting better
 
00:35:16.109 --> 00:35:16.119 align:start position:0%
or kids are not getting better that's
 
00:35:18.270 --> 00:35:18.280 align:start position:0%
really important to me one of the things
 
00:35:19.990 --> 00:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
that I would love to do over the next
 
00:35:22.069 --> 00:35:22.079 align:start position:0%
few years is to have further investment
 
00:35:24.589 --> 00:35:24.599 align:start position:0%
in our data and our analytics ability to
 
00:35:25.990 --> 00:35:26.000 align:start position:0%
actually think about that more on a
 
00:35:28.750 --> 00:35:28.760 align:start position:0%
population level so kids receiving these
 
00:35:31.069 --> 00:35:31.079 align:start position:0%
type of services are they getting better
 
00:35:33.030 --> 00:35:33.040 align:start position:0%
as opposed to maybe kids receiving these
 
00:35:34.829 --> 00:35:34.839 align:start position:0%
type of services that's really
 
00:35:38.470 --> 00:35:38.480 align:start position:0%
complicated to do um but it's the sort
 
00:35:40.990 --> 00:35:41.000 align:start position:0%
of work that we need to Endeavor upon
 
00:35:43.030 --> 00:35:43.040 align:start position:0%
over the next few years to get to a
 
00:35:45.470 --> 00:35:45.480 align:start position:0%
different level knowing that our pie is
 
00:35:46.870 --> 00:35:46.880 align:start position:0%
never going to get is not going to get
 
00:35:49.270 --> 00:35:49.280 align:start position:0%
bigger anytime in the in the near term
 
00:35:52.390 --> 00:35:52.400 align:start position:0%
so are we are we promoting the right
 
00:35:54.910 --> 00:35:54.920 align:start position:0%
things kids are all different they
 
00:35:56.550 --> 00:35:56.560 align:start position:0%
respond to different things it won't be
 
00:35:58.870 --> 00:35:58.880 align:start position:0%
a perfect algorithm them you're always
 
00:36:00.550 --> 00:36:00.560 align:start position:0%
going to have to address individual
 
00:36:02.349 --> 00:36:02.359 align:start position:0%
needs but I think we can be better
 
00:36:04.470 --> 00:36:04.480 align:start position:0%
informed as we look at the Improvement
 
00:36:06.309 --> 00:36:06.319 align:start position:0%
in you functioning it's something we
 
00:36:08.670 --> 00:36:08.680 align:start position:0%
manage right now again on a case-by Case
 
00:36:10.710 --> 00:36:10.720 align:start position:0%
basis but I think there's an opportunity
 
00:36:13.069 --> 00:36:13.079 align:start position:0%
moving forward to think about the data
 
00:36:15.829 --> 00:36:15.839 align:start position:0%
yes okay I I just want to understand
 
00:36:18.870 --> 00:36:18.880 align:start position:0%
this 95% of Youth are served in the
 
00:36:22.190 --> 00:36:22.200 align:start position:0%
communitybased settings what it's hard
 
00:36:25.790 --> 00:36:25.800 align:start position:0%
for me to imagine a a subset of the
 
00:36:27.990 --> 00:36:28.000 align:start position:0%
population that's actually getting
 
00:36:30.950 --> 00:36:30.960 align:start position:0%
Services I I have to think of the kids
 
00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
that are in our communities a majority
 
00:36:36.430 --> 00:36:36.440 align:start position:0%
of them are getting no Services correct
 
00:36:38.829 --> 00:36:38.839 align:start position:0%
they're go they are unserved correct
 
00:36:40.750 --> 00:36:40.760 align:start position:0%
this the way this is written implies
 
00:36:44.710 --> 00:36:44.720 align:start position:0%
that 95% of all kids in a community are
 
00:36:48.109 --> 00:36:48.119 align:start position:0%
are getting some sort of service well I
 
00:36:50.430 --> 00:36:50.440 align:start position:0%
I appreciate that and it is why it's
 
00:36:51.990 --> 00:36:52.000 align:start position:0%
labeled at the top around how do we
 
00:36:53.230 --> 00:36:53.240 align:start position:0%
measure success for children's
 
00:36:55.430 --> 00:36:55.440 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health so for the shock value
 
00:36:57.670 --> 00:36:57.680 align:start position:0%
alone I put this larger number but it is
 
00:36:59.230 --> 00:36:59.240 align:start position:0%
more nuanced you're correct of the
 
00:37:01.550 --> 00:37:01.560 align:start position:0%
children receiving be children's
 
00:37:04.589 --> 00:37:04.599 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health Services 95% of those
 
00:37:06.230 --> 00:37:06.240 align:start position:0%
are receiving communitybased Services
 
00:37:08.430 --> 00:37:08.440 align:start position:0%
could you Hazard a guess on what
 
00:37:10.550 --> 00:37:10.560 align:start position:0%
percentage of kids in communities are
 
00:37:13.309 --> 00:37:13.319 align:start position:0%
just unserved I don't know that number
 
00:37:15.069 --> 00:37:15.079 align:start position:0%
right now I could I probably can talk to
 
00:37:16.670 --> 00:37:16.680 align:start position:0%
people just think about it I I don't
 
00:37:18.470 --> 00:37:18.480 align:start position:0%
know if you need to research it but I
 
00:37:21.309 --> 00:37:21.319 align:start position:0%
I'd be sort of curious yeah yeah okay
 
00:37:23.230 --> 00:37:23.240 align:start position:0%
thank you and and it's also that's also
 
00:37:24.470 --> 00:37:24.480 align:start position:0%
hard to answer because if you think
 
00:37:26.750 --> 00:37:26.760 align:start position:0%
about that those tears that I had quite
 
00:37:28.630 --> 00:37:28.640 align:start position:0%
frankly every kid should be getting
 
00:37:30.430 --> 00:37:30.440 align:start position:0%
screened and assessed by their primary
 
00:37:32.710 --> 00:37:32.720 align:start position:0%
care doctor so you would hope that at
 
00:37:34.589 --> 00:37:34.599 align:start position:0%
some point that's everyone we bring our
 
00:37:36.790 --> 00:37:36.800 align:start position:0%
kids to the doctor they say hey how you
 
00:37:38.910 --> 00:37:38.920 align:start position:0%
doing th those are things that every
 
00:37:43.069 --> 00:37:43.079 align:start position:0%
that's a population expectation okay a
 
00:37:46.069 --> 00:37:46.079 align:start position:0%
represent prce thank you Mr chairman for
 
00:37:49.349 --> 00:37:49.359 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question um
 
00:37:52.150 --> 00:37:52.160 align:start position:0%
do you have any studies I'm really big
 
00:37:55.109 --> 00:37:55.119 align:start position:0%
on cost benefit analysis sure we know
 
00:37:58.150 --> 00:37:58.160 align:start position:0%
what the cost is on these programs
 
00:38:01.430 --> 00:38:01.440 align:start position:0%
we know the number of youths that are
 
00:38:05.109 --> 00:38:05.119 align:start position:0%
being served by them and we
 
00:38:06.950 --> 00:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
know the
 
00:38:09.309 --> 00:38:09.319 align:start position:0%
benefits but I would like to quantify
 
00:38:11.910 --> 00:38:11.920 align:start position:0%
those benefits with the dollar side do
 
00:38:14.750 --> 00:38:14.760 align:start position:0%
you have any of that information so I I
 
00:38:16.790 --> 00:38:16.800 align:start position:0%
can't rattle it off the top of my head
 
00:38:18.950 --> 00:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
but I know that certain of our programs
 
00:38:20.950 --> 00:38:20.960 align:start position:0%
this is why we we focus on these
 
00:38:23.589 --> 00:38:23.599 align:start position:0%
evidencebased programs because often
 
00:38:25.910 --> 00:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
times there were those sort of return on
 
00:38:27.910 --> 00:38:27.920 align:start position:0%
investment studies whether it's a cost
 
00:38:30.790 --> 00:38:30.800 align:start position:0%
benefit to say if you invest in this
 
00:38:32.990 --> 00:38:33.000 align:start position:0%
program you're less likely to pay out
 
00:38:35.470 --> 00:38:35.480 align:start position:0%
later on and oftentimes it's not within
 
00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
the same system so especially with
 
00:38:40.190 --> 00:38:40.200 align:start position:0%
children um who have experienced trauma
 
00:38:43.589 --> 00:38:43.599 align:start position:0%
or children in our dcyf system we know
 
00:38:46.870 --> 00:38:46.880 align:start position:0%
that um there's often a a direction that
 
00:38:48.430 --> 00:38:48.440 align:start position:0%
many of them enter the correctional
 
00:38:50.710 --> 00:38:50.720 align:start position:0%
system if their needs are not met and so
 
00:38:53.150 --> 00:38:53.160 align:start position:0%
or even as we think about home visiting
 
00:38:55.550 --> 00:38:55.560 align:start position:0%
services for babies there are long-term
 
00:38:57.150 --> 00:38:57.160 align:start position:0%
studies that say if you provide these
 
00:38:59.829 --> 00:38:59.839 align:start position:0%
early Childhood Services they're less
 
00:39:03.230 --> 00:39:03.240 align:start position:0%
likely to enter into those costly um
 
00:39:05.790 --> 00:39:05.800 align:start position:0%
Correctional settings or even in school
 
00:39:07.910 --> 00:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
have the sort of um special ed
 
00:39:09.630 --> 00:39:09.640 align:start position:0%
requirements that other kids have so
 
00:39:11.990 --> 00:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
individual programs have that data could
 
00:39:15.309 --> 00:39:15.319 align:start position:0%
I um get a copy of that inform we'll put
 
00:39:16.950 --> 00:39:16.960 align:start position:0%
something together make it together
 
00:39:19.030 --> 00:39:19.040 align:start position:0%
because I think it's very important when
 
00:39:21.390 --> 00:39:21.400 align:start position:0%
we're talking about programs and and
 
00:39:23.710 --> 00:39:23.720 align:start position:0%
whether or not they're advantageous or
 
00:39:25.790 --> 00:39:25.800 align:start position:0%
cost effective absolutely thank you and
 
00:39:27.589 --> 00:39:27.599 align:start position:0%
and I think one of the struggles that we
 
00:39:30.430 --> 00:39:30.440 align:start position:0%
have um as a government agency and and
 
00:39:32.309 --> 00:39:32.319 align:start position:0%
you all have every year is that often
 
00:39:33.790 --> 00:39:33.800 align:start position:0%
those savings aren't realized in two
 
00:39:36.069 --> 00:39:36.079 align:start position:0%
years that those are longterm life
 
00:39:38.349 --> 00:39:38.359 align:start position:0%
course savings and so that's difficult
 
00:39:41.030 --> 00:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
to budget for or it's it's complicated
 
00:39:42.710 --> 00:39:42.720 align:start position:0%
to budget for I don't know that it's
 
00:39:44.069 --> 00:39:44.079 align:start position:0%
difficult but it is it adds a
 
00:39:45.710 --> 00:39:45.720 align:start position:0%
complication because oftentimes you're
 
00:39:47.150 --> 00:39:47.160 align:start position:0%
not saving money
 
00:39:49.829 --> 00:39:49.839 align:start position:0%
tomorrow thank
 
00:39:54.550 --> 00:39:54.560 align:start position:0%
you I I I I'm I'm dwelling on on the on
 
00:39:57.109 --> 00:39:57.119 align:start position:0%
the implication of page 10 here still
 
00:39:57.119 --> 00:39:57.829 align:start position:0%
the implication of page 10 here still
and

00:39:57.829 --> 00:39:57.839 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:39:59.950 --> 00:39:59.960 align:start position:0%
uh and I'm it it seems to me that
 
00:40:02.950 --> 00:40:02.960 align:start position:0%
there's some percentage of our youth
 
00:40:07.069 --> 00:40:07.079 align:start position:0%
population that are so emotionally and
 
00:40:09.270 --> 00:40:09.280 align:start position:0%
mentally healthy that they don't really
 
00:40:11.790 --> 00:40:11.800 align:start position:0%
come into our system correct right
 
00:40:15.470 --> 00:40:15.480 align:start position:0%
correct and what are we doing to
 
00:40:17.710 --> 00:40:17.720 align:start position:0%
understand the kids that don't need any
 
00:40:20.030 --> 00:40:20.040 align:start position:0%
Services because we need to do more of
 
00:40:21.950 --> 00:40:21.960 align:start position:0%
that you know what um you are speaking
 
00:40:23.349 --> 00:40:23.359 align:start position:0%
my language right now because that's
 
00:40:25.470 --> 00:40:25.480 align:start position:0%
what in in this world we call protective
 
00:40:27.950 --> 00:40:27.960 align:start position:0%
factors kids who have protective factors
 
00:40:30.230 --> 00:40:30.240 align:start position:0%
around them and don't end up you know
 
00:40:32.790 --> 00:40:32.800 align:start position:0%
that they have resiliency and protective
 
00:40:34.670 --> 00:40:34.680 align:start position:0%
factors and we know some of those things
 
00:40:37.230 --> 00:40:37.240 align:start position:0%
we know that having you know their
 
00:40:39.270 --> 00:40:39.280 align:start position:0%
financial needs met if you've got house
 
00:40:41.349 --> 00:40:41.359 align:start position:0%
stable housing if you have food to eat
 
00:40:43.030 --> 00:40:43.040 align:start position:0%
all of those things are protective
 
00:40:45.710 --> 00:40:45.720 align:start position:0%
factors um and then there's also other
 
00:40:47.470 --> 00:40:47.480 align:start position:0%
things that are harder to quantify
 
00:40:50.190 --> 00:40:50.200 align:start position:0%
around the stability of a family again
 
00:40:52.550 --> 00:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
not all kids even the kids in you know
 
00:40:55.069 --> 00:40:55.079 align:start position:0%
the most idelic Beaver to you know Leave
 
00:40:56.630 --> 00:40:56.640 align:start position:0%
it to Beaver family there are going to
 
00:40:58.630 --> 00:40:58.640 align:start position:0%
be kids that for whatever reason have
 
00:41:01.309 --> 00:41:01.319 align:start position:0%
needs that need to be met but I think we
 
00:41:04.230 --> 00:41:04.240 align:start position:0%
do know that there are the the supports
 
00:41:06.710 --> 00:41:06.720 align:start position:0%
that we need is you know Str connections
 
00:41:10.630 --> 00:41:10.640 align:start position:0%
to community connections to um having a
 
00:41:12.910 --> 00:41:12.920 align:start position:0%
caring adult in your life that's one of
 
00:41:14.910 --> 00:41:14.920 align:start position:0%
the main things right there as simple
 
00:41:18.069 --> 00:41:18.079 align:start position:0%
and complicated as that
 
00:41:20.790 --> 00:41:20.800 align:start position:0%
is all right this and this isn't as much
 
00:41:23.349 --> 00:41:23.359 align:start position:0%
to ask you for an an answer but just to
 
00:41:25.230 --> 00:41:25.240 align:start position:0%
drop a a thing that I've been thinking
 
00:41:28.030 --> 00:41:28.040 align:start position:0%
about for a few months and that is
 
00:41:31.109 --> 00:41:31.119 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm I'm I'm just generally concerned
 
00:41:33.950 --> 00:41:33.960 align:start position:0%
if the programs that we're setting up
 
00:41:37.630 --> 00:41:37.640 align:start position:0%
have the right incentives in them uh and
 
00:41:40.270 --> 00:41:40.280 align:start position:0%
and so there there is an incentive I
 
00:41:42.990 --> 00:41:43.000 align:start position:0%
think for uh individuals to go out and
 
00:41:45.710 --> 00:41:45.720 align:start position:0%
seek care and stay in a care environment
 
00:41:48.790 --> 00:41:48.800 align:start position:0%
and and get whatever benefits you know
 
00:41:51.870 --> 00:41:51.880 align:start position:0%
um they can through um a care
 
00:41:53.910 --> 00:41:53.920 align:start position:0%
environment so at an individual level
 
00:41:56.069 --> 00:41:56.079 align:start position:0%
there's somewhat of an incentive build
 
00:41:57.790 --> 00:41:57.800 align:start position:0%
in to go seek
 
00:42:00.630 --> 00:42:00.640 align:start position:0%
services and then I think also from the
 
00:42:03.109 --> 00:42:03.119 align:start position:0%
program management perspective sometimes
 
00:42:06.390 --> 00:42:06.400 align:start position:0%
we end up with situations where um uh
 
00:42:08.950 --> 00:42:08.960 align:start position:0%
the people that work for uh the state uh
 
00:42:11.230 --> 00:42:11.240 align:start position:0%
through contract or through employment
 
00:42:14.109 --> 00:42:14.119 align:start position:0%
they have an incentive I think sometimes
 
00:42:18.150 --> 00:42:18.160 align:start position:0%
to um to to to to build the program to
 
00:42:21.470 --> 00:42:21.480 align:start position:0%
to get as many numbers as they can and
 
00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:24.240 align:start position:0%
and so it makes me wonder what kind of
 
00:42:27.630 --> 00:42:27.640 align:start position:0%
incentive system uh we might need
 
00:42:30.630 --> 00:42:30.640 align:start position:0%
uh or if there is a need to encourage
 
00:42:35.150 --> 00:42:35.160 align:start position:0%
our our own team to be actively seeking
 
00:42:37.309 --> 00:42:37.319 align:start position:0%
ways to get people out of
 
00:42:39.910 --> 00:42:39.920 align:start position:0%
programs thank you um you know I would
 
00:42:41.870 --> 00:42:41.880 align:start position:0%
certainly suggest that no one wants kids
 
00:42:45.349 --> 00:42:45.359 align:start position:0%
to not be well I I I right but I'm I'm
 
00:42:47.710 --> 00:42:47.720 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm also just worried about the the
 
00:42:50.829 --> 00:42:50.839 align:start position:0%
the our team our team needs an incentive
 
00:42:54.829 --> 00:42:54.839 align:start position:0%
to actively try to achieve success
 
00:42:56.670 --> 00:42:56.680 align:start position:0%
because I you know I used to be in the
 
00:42:59.589 --> 00:42:59.599 align:start position:0%
military I saw how bureaucracy can work
 
00:43:01.790 --> 00:43:01.800 align:start position:0%
if you want your program to do well if
 
00:43:04.349 --> 00:43:04.359 align:start position:0%
you want to do well you try to grow your
 
00:43:07.270 --> 00:43:07.280 align:start position:0%
program and and there aren't natural
 
00:43:09.870 --> 00:43:09.880 align:start position:0%
incentives built into the system to have
 
00:43:13.950 --> 00:43:13.960 align:start position:0%
people try to uh unwind their program
 
00:43:15.950 --> 00:43:15.960 align:start position:0%
the only time I've seen that actually is
 
00:43:19.190 --> 00:43:19.200 align:start position:0%
what Medicaid was doing to get people uh
 
00:43:23.230 --> 00:43:23.240 align:start position:0%
postco off that's a rare instance so I
 
00:43:24.790 --> 00:43:24.800 align:start position:0%
don't know that there's an answer to it
 
00:43:27.109 --> 00:43:27.119 align:start position:0%
I just thought I would share with you
 
00:43:29.829 --> 00:43:29.839 align:start position:0%
one of my my my background creeping
 
00:43:32.950 --> 00:43:32.960 align:start position:0%
concerns about are incentive systems
 
00:43:35.710 --> 00:43:35.720 align:start position:0%
built to encourage everyone to be
 
00:43:37.670 --> 00:43:37.680 align:start position:0%
working towards the same objective which
 
00:43:39.870 --> 00:43:39.880 align:start position:0%
I hope is to have healthy people who
 
00:43:42.230 --> 00:43:42.240 align:start position:0%
don't need programs correct I I would
 
00:43:43.910 --> 00:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
agree with you in that you know and I
 
00:43:46.190 --> 00:43:46.200 align:start position:0%
think we have examples where you know we
 
00:43:48.190 --> 00:43:48.200 align:start position:0%
have seen that data work our Juvenile
 
00:43:49.750 --> 00:43:49.760 align:start position:0%
Justice transformation is probably one
 
00:43:51.790 --> 00:43:51.800 align:start position:0%
of the best examples we no longer have
 
00:43:54.910 --> 00:43:54.920 align:start position:0%
an incentive to get as many kids in syc
 
00:43:56.190 --> 00:43:56.200 align:start position:0%
as possible I don't know that there ever
 
00:43:58.829 --> 00:43:58.839 align:start position:0%
was an incentive but we're now really
 
00:44:01.510 --> 00:44:01.520 align:start position:0%
the movement is let's make that number
 
00:44:03.230 --> 00:44:03.240 align:start position:0%
as small as
 
00:44:05.750 --> 00:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
possible I just had a comment on that I
 
00:44:08.829 --> 00:44:08.839 align:start position:0%
first want to sorry I want to thank you
 
00:44:13.069 --> 00:44:13.079 align:start position:0%
Miss Tilly for I love the triangle and I
 
00:44:15.589 --> 00:44:15.599 align:start position:0%
love the philosophy behind it in
 
00:44:20.510 --> 00:44:20.520 align:start position:0%
investing in these programs that bring
 
00:44:23.829 --> 00:44:23.839 align:start position:0%
protective factors to children and and
 
00:44:27.190 --> 00:44:27.200 align:start position:0%
stopping it at the at the base level um
 
00:44:29.069 --> 00:44:29.079 align:start position:0%
um and I just wanted to say that the
 
00:44:32.030 --> 00:44:32.040 align:start position:0%
visual I think is very helpful and if we
 
00:44:35.470 --> 00:44:35.480 align:start position:0%
can find those ways we're not looking to
 
00:44:39.109 --> 00:44:39.119 align:start position:0%
grow the bureaucracy around the top part
 
00:44:42.069 --> 00:44:42.079 align:start position:0%
of the triangle however looking how we
 
00:44:44.710 --> 00:44:44.720 align:start position:0%
can wrap around those people at the
 
00:44:47.109 --> 00:44:47.119 align:start position:0%
bottom to make sure and and it allows us
 
00:44:49.069 --> 00:44:49.079 align:start position:0%
to change the focus of the department to
 
00:44:51.349 --> 00:44:51.359 align:start position:0%
Wellness as opposed to having to provide
 
00:44:56.109 --> 00:44:56.119 align:start position:0%
that Urgent Care um I think is a is a a
 
00:44:58.069 --> 00:44:58.079 align:start position:0%
good goal for all of of us to have thank
 
00:45:00.030 --> 00:45:00.040 align:start position:0%
you so that was a comment not a question
 
00:45:05.430 --> 00:45:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:09.589 --> 00:45:09.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:12.829 --> 00:45:12.839 align:start position:0%
back so we can flip back to that tippy
 
00:45:16.030 --> 00:45:16.040 align:start position:0%
top of the the um of the pyramid again
 
00:45:19.390 --> 00:45:19.400 align:start position:0%
on slide 11 so this is uh information
 
00:45:21.750 --> 00:45:21.760 align:start position:0%
that we often share at Children's
 
00:45:23.870 --> 00:45:23.880 align:start position:0%
oversight committee so one of the many
 
00:45:26.109 --> 00:45:26.119 align:start position:0%
ways that we have accountability to our
 
00:45:28.069 --> 00:45:28.079 align:start position:0%
program specific Al around the division
 
00:45:29.549 --> 00:45:29.559 align:start position:0%
for children youth and families and our
 
00:45:30.990 --> 00:45:31.000 align:start position:0%
division for Behavioral Health is we
 
00:45:33.589 --> 00:45:33.599 align:start position:0%
have a children's oversight committee um
 
00:45:35.510 --> 00:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
Senator Carson and Senator Whitley had
 
00:45:37.270 --> 00:45:37.280 align:start position:0%
co-chaired that in the past it will be
 
00:45:39.470 --> 00:45:39.480 align:start position:0%
reestablished in in February 21st for
 
00:45:41.390 --> 00:45:41.400 align:start position:0%
this time and this is a slide that we
 
00:45:43.710 --> 00:45:43.720 align:start position:0%
present to them every every time we meet
 
00:45:45.510 --> 00:45:45.520 align:start position:0%
whether it's monthly or or every other
 
00:45:47.870 --> 00:45:47.880 align:start position:0%
month is just sort of the understanding
 
00:45:50.349 --> 00:45:50.359 align:start position:0%
again around Residential Care given the
 
00:45:54.870 --> 00:45:54.880 align:start position:0%
focus of the um impact to kids as well
 
00:45:57.430 --> 00:45:57.440 align:start position:0%
as the financial impact of residential
 
00:45:58.870 --> 00:45:58.880 align:start position:0%
care and here's where you can see we've
 
00:46:02.750 --> 00:46:02.760 align:start position:0%
got 349 kids this was back in um I think
 
00:46:07.069 --> 00:46:07.079 align:start position:0%
this was early early January data um yes
 
00:46:10.150 --> 00:46:10.160 align:start position:0%
January 7th we pulled this up we had 349
 
00:46:12.950 --> 00:46:12.960 align:start position:0%
kids the vast majority of those kids are
 
00:46:15.950 --> 00:46:15.960 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire 262 of those 349
 
00:46:18.950 --> 00:46:18.960 align:start position:0%
they're here and then the next group is
 
00:46:21.670 --> 00:46:21.680 align:start position:0%
a few more are in New England especially
 
00:46:23.510 --> 00:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
because we try and keep them close to
 
00:46:25.630 --> 00:46:25.640 align:start position:0%
home close to the people who care about
 
00:46:27.430 --> 00:46:27.440 align:start position:0%
them close to the people who love them
 
00:46:29.030 --> 00:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
often times if you live in Nashville
 
00:46:31.309 --> 00:46:31.319 align:start position:0%
that's in MA that's in Massachusetts
 
00:46:33.430 --> 00:46:33.440 align:start position:0%
that's not way up North and so we think
 
00:46:35.670 --> 00:46:35.680 align:start position:0%
about New England care as keeping folks
 
00:46:37.750 --> 00:46:37.760 align:start position:0%
close to home just given the small size
 
00:46:39.510 --> 00:46:39.520 align:start position:0%
of our New England states and then you
 
00:46:41.870 --> 00:46:41.880 align:start position:0%
can see this small number that we always
 
00:46:44.390 --> 00:46:44.400 align:start position:0%
hope for it to be smaller that might of
 
00:46:46.990 --> 00:46:47.000 align:start position:0%
individuals who might need care outside
 
00:46:49.190 --> 00:46:49.200 align:start position:0%
of New England and that's because those
 
00:46:52.309 --> 00:46:52.319 align:start position:0%
kids have such incredibly complex needs
 
00:46:54.790 --> 00:46:54.800 align:start position:0%
um and may have been served already and
 
00:46:57.150 --> 00:46:57.160 align:start position:0%
likely have been already served in New
 
00:47:00.230 --> 00:47:00.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or New England and their their
 
00:47:02.630 --> 00:47:02.640 align:start position:0%
um need for specialization exists that
 
00:47:04.309 --> 00:47:04.319 align:start position:0%
we need to find somewhere else in the
 
00:47:06.190 --> 00:47:06.200 align:start position:0%
country that's a good fit for them but
 
00:47:08.990 --> 00:47:09.000 align:start position:0%
what we do is the minute folks are leave
 
00:47:10.829 --> 00:47:10.839 align:start position:0%
you know we've got a youth who needs to
 
00:47:13.950 --> 00:47:13.960 align:start position:0%
go to Florida for care we're working
 
00:47:15.750 --> 00:47:15.760 align:start position:0%
right away to figure out how do you get
 
00:47:17.589 --> 00:47:17.599 align:start position:0%
them back home you know and and that's
 
00:47:20.150 --> 00:47:20.160 align:start position:0%
been a cultural shift um in the work
 
00:47:22.710 --> 00:47:22.720 align:start position:0%
that we do uh because in some ways we're
 
00:47:24.430 --> 00:47:24.440 align:start position:0%
often just happy to have a place where
 
00:47:26.549 --> 00:47:26.559 align:start position:0%
they're thriving happy to have a place
 
00:47:27.990 --> 00:47:28.000 align:start position:0%
that they're getting the care that they
 
00:47:30.390 --> 00:47:30.400 align:start position:0%
need and our staff can you know take
 
00:47:32.670 --> 00:47:32.680 align:start position:0%
especially for the kids that are in DCF
 
00:47:34.670 --> 00:47:34.680 align:start position:0%
our staff can take a break a breath
 
00:47:36.069 --> 00:47:36.079 align:start position:0%
because they know they're safe and
 
00:47:38.510 --> 00:47:38.520 align:start position:0%
they're cared for but we've really
 
00:47:41.030 --> 00:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
pushed on our practice and our culture
 
00:47:43.790 --> 00:47:43.800 align:start position:0%
to say oh you know let's figure out what
 
00:47:46.190 --> 00:47:46.200 align:start position:0%
the pathway is to coming back home
 
00:47:48.589 --> 00:47:48.599 align:start position:0%
what's the pathway to eventually having
 
00:47:50.950 --> 00:47:50.960 align:start position:0%
this youth if not live with their own
 
00:47:54.109 --> 00:47:54.119 align:start position:0%
biological family with kin with Foster
 
00:47:56.270 --> 00:47:56.280 align:start position:0%
family that's ready to meet their needs
 
00:47:58.910 --> 00:47:58.920 align:start position:0%
so this this is just a uh this uh slide
 
00:48:01.069 --> 00:48:01.079 align:start position:0%
is really just an example of the
 
00:48:03.670 --> 00:48:03.680 align:start position:0%
complexity of that care and the fact
 
00:48:05.430 --> 00:48:05.440 align:start position:0%
that we are working on it with each
 
00:48:07.030 --> 00:48:07.040 align:start position:0%
individual those kids especially that
 
00:48:09.190 --> 00:48:09.200 align:start position:0%
are in our um division for children
 
00:48:11.510 --> 00:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
Youth and Family system to make sure
 
00:48:12.829 --> 00:48:12.839 align:start position:0%
that they're getting the care that they
 
00:48:14.950 --> 00:48:14.960 align:start position:0%
need that they're safe and that we're
 
00:48:17.390 --> 00:48:17.400 align:start position:0%
thinking about ways to get them back
 
00:48:21.870 --> 00:48:21.880 align:start position:0%
home in whatever home means for them so
 
00:48:24.150 --> 00:48:24.160 align:start position:0%
moving on to the next slide so where are
 
00:48:26.390 --> 00:48:26.400 align:start position:0%
we going next I think you know as we've
 
00:48:28.710 --> 00:48:28.720 align:start position:0%
described that triangle is really the
 
00:48:30.950 --> 00:48:30.960 align:start position:0%
visual in my mind is flipping that
 
00:48:33.990 --> 00:48:34.000 align:start position:0%
triangle um representative Edwards had
 
00:48:35.589 --> 00:48:35.599 align:start position:0%
asked are you thinking about other
 
00:48:38.470 --> 00:48:38.480 align:start position:0%
models and the answer is absolutely 100%
 
00:48:40.230 --> 00:48:40.240 align:start position:0%
we're in the middle of working on an
 
00:48:42.390 --> 00:48:42.400 align:start position:0%
assessment with some national experts
 
00:48:44.670 --> 00:48:44.680 align:start position:0%
who know the children's system of care
 
00:48:46.230 --> 00:48:46.240 align:start position:0%
work that's happening all around the
 
00:48:48.430 --> 00:48:48.440 align:start position:0%
country they interviewed a cast of
 
00:48:49.990 --> 00:48:50.000 align:start position:0%
thousands in New Hampshire they
 
00:48:51.710 --> 00:48:51.720 align:start position:0%
interviewed providers they interviewed
 
00:48:53.630 --> 00:48:53.640 align:start position:0%
families they interviewed bureaucrats
 
00:48:56.230 --> 00:48:56.240 align:start position:0%
like me to say what's working and what's
 
00:48:58.510 --> 00:48:58.520 align:start position:0%
not working in our current system of
 
00:49:01.069 --> 00:49:01.079 align:start position:0%
care how can we continually assess it
 
00:49:03.510 --> 00:49:03.520 align:start position:0%
and really focus on what our progress
 
00:49:05.630 --> 00:49:05.640 align:start position:0%
needs to be what are our next steps
 
00:49:08.190 --> 00:49:08.200 align:start position:0%
final report is due in March we're very
 
00:49:09.549 --> 00:49:09.559 align:start position:0%
excited about it we've seen some
 
00:49:13.030 --> 00:49:13.040 align:start position:0%
previews of that work um and none of it
 
00:49:15.950 --> 00:49:15.960 align:start position:0%
is particularly um surprising although
 
00:49:18.109 --> 00:49:18.119 align:start position:0%
you can flip to the to the next page on
 
00:49:20.910 --> 00:49:20.920 align:start position:0%
13 you know some of these These are the
 
00:49:22.630 --> 00:49:22.640 align:start position:0%
themes that we're seeing right now and
 
00:49:24.349 --> 00:49:24.359 align:start position:0%
again this comes from the providers in
 
00:49:25.910 --> 00:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
the community from families who've
 
00:49:28.270 --> 00:49:28.280 align:start position:0%
experienced it youth who've had lived
 
00:49:30.430 --> 00:49:30.440 align:start position:0%
experience these are some of the themes
 
00:49:32.549 --> 00:49:32.559 align:start position:0%
we're thinking about is around again how
 
00:49:34.910 --> 00:49:34.920 align:start position:0%
do we not only have those Prevention
 
00:49:36.870 --> 00:49:36.880 align:start position:0%
Services but how do we align them how do
 
00:49:39.630 --> 00:49:39.640 align:start position:0%
we know we're moving towards the same
 
00:49:42.069 --> 00:49:42.079 align:start position:0%
thing towards the same goal especially
 
00:49:44.030 --> 00:49:44.040 align:start position:0%
if you think back about the the fact
 
00:49:46.470 --> 00:49:46.480 align:start position:0%
that we have you know activities across
 
00:49:48.589 --> 00:49:48.599 align:start position:0%
the Department Child Care is a
 
00:49:50.990 --> 00:49:51.000 align:start position:0%
protective Factor that's a great example
 
00:49:52.230 --> 00:49:52.240 align:start position:0%
that's not within the division of
 
00:49:54.829 --> 00:49:54.839 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health but it's critical um
 
00:49:56.190 --> 00:49:56.200 align:start position:0%
component to making sure kids are
 
00:49:59.030 --> 00:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
healthy how do we centralize a place to
 
00:50:01.549 --> 00:50:01.559 align:start position:0%
call um we have often had what we call a
 
00:50:05.470 --> 00:50:05.480 align:start position:0%
no wrong door policy um and um but
 
00:50:07.270 --> 00:50:07.280 align:start position:0%
sometimes that's too diffuse for people
 
00:50:08.829 --> 00:50:08.839 align:start position:0%
and so we need to think about both how
 
00:50:11.349 --> 00:50:11.359 align:start position:0%
we Market it and how we structure how do
 
00:50:13.630 --> 00:50:13.640 align:start position:0%
we know where to to call when we need
 
00:50:15.670 --> 00:50:15.680 align:start position:0%
help and then we just have to scale The
 
00:50:17.750 --> 00:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
Helpful Services strengthen those
 
00:50:20.349 --> 00:50:20.359 align:start position:0%
supports to stay home coordinate expert
 
00:50:22.670 --> 00:50:22.680 align:start position:0%
care and then you know the piece that
 
00:50:24.789 --> 00:50:24.799 align:start position:0%
always i' like to stay up working on is
 
00:50:26.309 --> 00:50:26.319 align:start position:0%
how do we measure that progress how do
 
00:50:28.870 --> 00:50:28.880 align:start position:0%
we know that what we're doing works at
 
00:50:31.789 --> 00:50:31.799 align:start position:0%
each of those levels so I'm going to
 
00:50:33.670 --> 00:50:33.680 align:start position:0%
move into our division for children
 
00:50:36.069 --> 00:50:36.079 align:start position:0%
youth and families now if if with
 
00:50:39.150 --> 00:50:39.160 align:start position:0%
without any more questions so a critical
 
00:50:41.030 --> 00:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
comp you know you think about the
 
00:50:42.670 --> 00:50:42.680 align:start position:0%
division for Behavioral Health and the
 
00:50:44.430 --> 00:50:44.440 align:start position:0%
children's system of care that's all
 
00:50:47.430 --> 00:50:47.440 align:start position:0%
kids um with specific focus on kids on
 
00:50:49.630 --> 00:50:49.640 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and kids that are in dcyf and
 
00:50:54.470 --> 00:50:54.480 align:start position:0%
then we think about our dcyf system um I
 
00:50:55.990 --> 00:50:56.000 align:start position:0%
I've been lucky to be working more
 
00:50:58.150 --> 00:50:58.160 align:start position:0%
closely with DCF for the past year
 
00:51:00.950 --> 00:51:00.960 align:start position:0%
although I had spent my previous life in
 
00:51:02.910 --> 00:51:02.920 align:start position:0%
public health working with DCF a lot
 
00:51:04.589 --> 00:51:04.599 align:start position:0%
especially around the Prevention
 
00:51:06.950 --> 00:51:06.960 align:start position:0%
Services or the prevent those those
 
00:51:08.390 --> 00:51:08.400 align:start position:0%
areas around young children in
 
00:51:10.309 --> 00:51:10.319 align:start position:0%
particular and I have always been struck
 
00:51:12.109 --> 00:51:12.119 align:start position:0%
by this ntion this notion that we truly
 
00:51:14.710 --> 00:51:14.720 align:start position:0%
are all in this together dcyf is not
 
00:51:16.069 --> 00:51:16.079 align:start position:0%
something that just happens over in a
 
00:51:18.710 --> 00:51:18.720 align:start position:0%
corner it really is all of our jobs in
 
00:51:21.190 --> 00:51:21.200 align:start position:0%
the community to make sure kids are safe
 
00:51:23.270 --> 00:51:23.280 align:start position:0%
um primarily it's the reason why all of
 
00:51:26.589 --> 00:51:26.599 align:start position:0%
us are mandated reporters um we all want
 
00:51:28.670 --> 00:51:28.680 align:start position:0%
Safe Kids we all want strong families we
 
00:51:31.470 --> 00:51:31.480 align:start position:0%
all want stable communities in that way
 
00:51:34.230 --> 00:51:34.240 align:start position:0%
we have done some tremendous work um DCF
 
00:51:36.150 --> 00:51:36.160 align:start position:0%
unfortunately as you all know has been
 
00:51:39.190 --> 00:51:39.200 align:start position:0%
in the spotlight for quite some time um
 
00:51:41.510 --> 00:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
and I have been so impressed with the
 
00:51:43.270 --> 00:51:43.280 align:start position:0%
way in which our our current director
 
00:51:46.430 --> 00:51:46.440 align:start position:0%
Marie nuned has gathered the troops
 
00:51:49.510 --> 00:51:49.520 align:start position:0%
focused on high quality practice making
 
00:51:53.390 --> 00:51:53.400 align:start position:0%
sure what we're doing um is the right
 
00:51:55.349 --> 00:51:55.359 align:start position:0%
sort of work we should be doing it is an
 
00:51:57.630 --> 00:51:57.640 align:start position:0%
alignment with our policies and our
 
00:51:59.630 --> 00:51:59.640 align:start position:0%
procedure and most importantly we're
 
00:52:02.470 --> 00:52:02.480 align:start position:0%
keeping Kids Safe um we've made a number
 
00:52:05.069 --> 00:52:05.079 align:start position:0%
of improvements as we focused on focused
 
00:52:06.950 --> 00:52:06.960 align:start position:0%
on this both in the child protection
 
00:52:09.870 --> 00:52:09.880 align:start position:0%
space as well as Juvenile Justice and
 
00:52:11.589 --> 00:52:11.599 align:start position:0%
you know I'd be thrilled to stay here
 
00:52:13.270 --> 00:52:13.280 align:start position:0%
and talk for hours about the work that's
 
00:52:15.190 --> 00:52:15.200 align:start position:0%
happening here it's really quite
 
00:52:18.630 --> 00:52:18.640 align:start position:0%
extraordinary one of the cultural shifts
 
00:52:20.270 --> 00:52:20.280 align:start position:0%
that you see and and has been part of
 
00:52:22.549 --> 00:52:22.559 align:start position:0%
this entire story is around serving
 
00:52:25.190 --> 00:52:25.200 align:start position:0%
youth at home and youth belong to F
 
00:52:26.990 --> 00:52:27.000 align:start position:0%
along with families and we know that
 
00:52:29.230 --> 00:52:29.240 align:start position:0%
that's not always the family of origin
 
00:52:32.510 --> 00:52:32.520 align:start position:0%
but that can be a me a family member a
 
00:52:34.750 --> 00:52:34.760 align:start position:0%
kinship is what we call it in that in
 
00:52:36.870 --> 00:52:36.880 align:start position:0%
that space um and it can also be
 
00:52:38.910 --> 00:52:38.920 align:start position:0%
something that we call fictive Kin which
 
00:52:40.910 --> 00:52:40.920 align:start position:0%
is a a word that sounds a little clunky
 
00:52:42.789 --> 00:52:42.799 align:start position:0%
but that could be the coach that could
 
00:52:44.109 --> 00:52:44.119 align:start position:0%
be someone who's vetted in their
 
00:52:46.670 --> 00:52:46.680 align:start position:0%
communities a friend to the family who
 
00:52:48.710 --> 00:52:48.720 align:start position:0%
we that is safe and really the right
 
00:52:51.030 --> 00:52:51.040 align:start position:0%
place where that child can Thrive rather
 
00:52:53.349 --> 00:52:53.359 align:start position:0%
than a historical perspective of moving
 
00:52:55.430 --> 00:52:55.440 align:start position:0%
kids always into foster care or worse
 
00:52:58.349 --> 00:52:58.359 align:start position:0%
yet Residential Care and so this shift
 
00:53:00.990 --> 00:53:01.000 align:start position:0%
this shift and really further focus in
 
00:53:02.910 --> 00:53:02.920 align:start position:0%
this area I think is going to make some
 
00:53:04.710 --> 00:53:04.720 align:start position:0%
fundamental changes over the ne over the
 
00:53:07.190 --> 00:53:07.200 align:start position:0%
next few years for the first time now we
 
00:53:09.910 --> 00:53:09.920 align:start position:0%
have more kids in kinship placements
 
00:53:11.750 --> 00:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
again where they're not safe to be with
 
00:53:14.390 --> 00:53:14.400 align:start position:0%
their family of origin but but there's
 
00:53:16.349 --> 00:53:16.359 align:start position:0%
someone in their lives there's family in
 
00:53:18.030 --> 00:53:18.040 align:start position:0%
their lives that they are safe with and
 
00:53:20.670 --> 00:53:20.680 align:start position:0%
so we're making sure to facilitate that
 
00:53:23.109 --> 00:53:23.119 align:start position:0%
and strengthen those those relationships
 
00:53:26.589 --> 00:53:26.599 align:start position:0%
so that it's easier for that to happen
 
00:53:29.710 --> 00:53:29.720 align:start position:0%
in additionally as we look at um our
 
00:53:31.069 --> 00:53:31.079 align:start position:0%
priorities you're going to see that
 
00:53:33.230 --> 00:53:33.240 align:start position:0%
you're going to see this focus of you
 
00:53:35.870 --> 00:53:35.880 align:start position:0%
know the right services at the right
 
00:53:38.109 --> 00:53:38.119 align:start position:0%
time you're going to see that family
 
00:53:40.670 --> 00:53:40.680 align:start position:0%
engagement really is the heart of dcyf
 
00:53:42.270 --> 00:53:42.280 align:start position:0%
and back to the and to the bottom of
 
00:53:44.150 --> 00:53:44.160 align:start position:0%
there you're going to see some metrics
 
00:53:45.789 --> 00:53:45.799 align:start position:0%
and that's the work that we're doing to
 
00:53:47.990 --> 00:53:48.000 align:start position:0%
sort of measure how well we're doing so
 
00:53:49.829 --> 00:53:49.839 align:start position:0%
we know that we are accountable not only
 
00:53:52.030 --> 00:53:52.040 align:start position:0%
to bodies like children's oversight to
 
00:53:53.750 --> 00:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
you all at the general Council to our
 
00:53:55.349 --> 00:53:55.359 align:start position:0%
governor's office we're accountable to a
 
00:53:57.430 --> 00:53:57.440 align:start position:0%
lot of people they advisory groups that
 
00:53:59.430 --> 00:53:59.440 align:start position:0%
were accountable and this is the way
 
00:54:00.710 --> 00:54:00.720 align:start position:0%
that we're going to show you that that
 
00:54:02.870 --> 00:54:02.880 align:start position:0%
we we mean business and we're we're
 
00:54:04.470 --> 00:54:04.480 align:start position:0%
measuring what we're doing so we're
 
00:54:05.910 --> 00:54:05.920 align:start position:0%
looking at reducing Residential
 
00:54:09.109 --> 00:54:09.119 align:start position:0%
Treatment by 10% we're looking at incre
 
00:54:11.870 --> 00:54:11.880 align:start position:0%
you know decreasing those vacant cpsws
 
00:54:13.910 --> 00:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
you know we all know that we need to
 
00:54:16.390 --> 00:54:16.400 align:start position:0%
have good case loads where child
 
00:54:18.589 --> 00:54:18.599 align:start position:0%
protective workers can see all the kids
 
00:54:20.390 --> 00:54:20.400 align:start position:0%
that they're supposed to see and have
 
00:54:22.309 --> 00:54:22.319 align:start position:0%
eyes and ears on them to in order to
 
00:54:24.750 --> 00:54:24.760 align:start position:0%
keep them safe we want to make sure that
 
00:54:27.950 --> 00:54:27.960 align:start position:0%
kids are served in their own homes um
 
00:54:29.910 --> 00:54:29.920 align:start position:0%
you know as much as possible again
 
00:54:31.950 --> 00:54:31.960 align:start position:0%
keeping a family intact where it's
 
00:54:34.510 --> 00:54:34.520 align:start position:0%
possible and wrapping services around
 
00:54:35.910 --> 00:54:35.920 align:start position:0%
them whether it's the Behavioral Health
 
00:54:38.030 --> 00:54:38.040 align:start position:0%
Services for Mom and Dad or the
 
00:54:39.950 --> 00:54:39.960 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health Services for the kids
 
00:54:41.630 --> 00:54:41.640 align:start position:0%
to make sure that that's a safe
 
00:54:44.870 --> 00:54:44.880 align:start position:0%
environment um we also you know we have
 
00:54:46.510 --> 00:54:46.520 align:start position:0%
some real structure we need to do around
 
00:54:48.190 --> 00:54:48.200 align:start position:0%
YDC we know where they we're going to
 
00:54:49.710 --> 00:54:49.720 align:start position:0%
need to reduce the number of kids that
 
00:54:51.950 --> 00:54:51.960 align:start position:0%
are served in the secure facility and
 
00:54:54.109 --> 00:54:54.119 align:start position:0%
finally in order to make this happen in
 
00:54:56.430 --> 00:54:56.440 align:start position:0%
order even to understand this data and
 
00:54:58.510 --> 00:54:58.520 align:start position:0%
have this sort of the the watch the
 
00:55:01.589 --> 00:55:01.599 align:start position:0%
metrics we are building a new um system
 
00:55:03.230 --> 00:55:03.240 align:start position:0%
called Granite families a new data
 
00:55:04.910 --> 00:55:04.920 align:start position:0%
system heard a little bit about with
 
00:55:07.390 --> 00:55:07.400 align:start position:0%
Dave weeders yesterday we this is long
 
00:55:09.349 --> 00:55:09.359 align:start position:0%
time in coming the data system we use
 
00:55:11.470 --> 00:55:11.480 align:start position:0%
right now is from the 1990s it is woful
 
00:55:13.589 --> 00:55:13.599 align:start position:0%
inadequate we need to have this data
 
00:55:16.150 --> 00:55:16.160 align:start position:0%
system to do our work say say that it
 
00:55:17.789 --> 00:55:17.799 align:start position:0%
system again it's called Granite
 
00:55:20.109 --> 00:55:20.119 align:start position:0%
families we are moving from Bridges to
 
00:55:22.430 --> 00:55:22.440 align:start position:0%
granate families thank you and it will
 
00:55:27.309 --> 00:55:27.319 align:start position:0%
likely be at the council um soon soon I
 
00:55:28.349 --> 00:55:28.359 align:start position:0%
I don't want to give a date but it's
 
00:55:30.029 --> 00:55:30.039 align:start position:0%
soon so we have been working on it for a
 
00:55:32.710 --> 00:55:32.720 align:start position:0%
number of years pulling this together
 
00:55:34.549 --> 00:55:34.559 align:start position:0%
because the federal government is paying
 
00:55:36.029 --> 00:55:36.039 align:start position:0%
for it the administration for children
 
00:55:38.150 --> 00:55:38.160 align:start position:0%
youth and families each step along the
 
00:55:40.870 --> 00:55:40.880 align:start position:0%
way they have to approve it um we have
 
00:55:43.109 --> 00:55:43.119 align:start position:0%
our own rigorous standards here at it
 
00:55:45.430 --> 00:55:45.440 align:start position:0%
for privacy and security and all of that
 
00:55:47.270 --> 00:55:47.280 align:start position:0%
so it has taken some time for this
 
00:55:48.950 --> 00:55:48.960 align:start position:0%
Behemoth system to get through those
 
00:55:51.069 --> 00:55:51.079 align:start position:0%
processes but we have final approval
 
00:55:52.670 --> 00:55:52.680 align:start position:0%
from our federal funders that our
 
00:55:54.630 --> 00:55:54.640 align:start position:0%
contract makes sense and we're ready to
 
00:55:56.829 --> 00:55:56.839 align:start position:0%
bring it to council soon
 
00:55:56.839 --> 00:55:58.430 align:start position:0%
bring it to council soon
thank

00:55:58.430 --> 00:55:58.440 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:56:01.150 --> 00:56:01.160 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:56:03.630 --> 00:56:03.640 align:start position:0%
Daniels thank you did you just say that
 
00:56:05.710 --> 00:56:05.720 align:start position:0%
the federal government was paying they
 
00:56:07.750 --> 00:56:07.760 align:start position:0%
have they pay a significant part of it
 
00:56:09.430 --> 00:56:09.440 align:start position:0%
so what what happens when the federal
 
00:56:11.870 --> 00:56:11.880 align:start position:0%
money runs
 
00:56:15.670 --> 00:56:15.680 align:start position:0%
out you know um that that will we will
 
00:56:17.589 --> 00:56:17.599 align:start position:0%
cross that bridge when we get to it
 
00:56:19.589 --> 00:56:19.599 align:start position:0%
about whether we don't anticipate this
 
00:56:22.069 --> 00:56:22.079 align:start position:0%
to be at a federal cut right now this is
 
00:56:24.470 --> 00:56:24.480 align:start position:0%
not um in any of the executive orders
 
00:56:26.870 --> 00:56:26.880 align:start position:0%
that we have seen from uh the Trump
 
00:56:29.270 --> 00:56:29.280 align:start position:0%
Administration so we anticipate that the
 
00:56:30.789 --> 00:56:30.799 align:start position:0%
federal government is going to honor its
 
00:56:33.710 --> 00:56:33.720 align:start position:0%
commitment to keeping kids safe and our
 
00:56:35.589 --> 00:56:35.599 align:start position:0%
our partnership there and I don't know
 
00:56:37.349 --> 00:56:37.359 align:start position:0%
Nathan if you want to remind me if that
 
00:56:40.430 --> 00:56:40.440 align:start position:0%
is a 100% federal or not I I would have
 
00:56:42.109 --> 00:56:42.119 align:start position:0%
to go back and look at it but I think
 
00:56:44.150 --> 00:56:44.160 align:start position:0%
what's important to recognize here is
 
00:56:45.910 --> 00:56:45.920 align:start position:0%
that the federal funds are being used to
 
00:56:47.430 --> 00:56:47.440 align:start position:0%
build the system so there will be
 
00:56:49.950 --> 00:56:49.960 align:start position:0%
ongoing maintenance costs but the the
 
00:56:51.910 --> 00:56:51.920 align:start position:0%
bulk of the cost are The Upfront
 
00:56:54.150 --> 00:56:54.160 align:start position:0%
development of the new system and and
 
00:56:55.910 --> 00:56:55.920 align:start position:0%
that'll be a one-time cost that we're
 
00:56:59.309 --> 00:56:59.319 align:start position:0%
that's satisfied today I I I see Mr
 
00:57:01.910 --> 00:57:01.920 align:start position:0%
weeders shifting in his seat did you did
 
00:57:04.710 --> 00:57:04.720 align:start position:0%
you want to say something to that Mr
 
00:57:07.349 --> 00:57:07.359 align:start position:0%
weers you you can just use a mic at the
 
00:57:15.510 --> 00:57:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:18.829 --> 00:57:18.839 align:start position:0%
here so the funding for Grant families
 
00:57:23.069 --> 00:57:23.079 align:start position:0%
is using ACF funding it's a 50% match so
 
00:57:25.150 --> 00:57:25.160 align:start position:0%
all the funding from ACF is usually a
 
00:57:27.510 --> 00:57:27.520 align:start position:0%
50% match for the design development and
 
00:57:30.029 --> 00:57:30.039 align:start position:0%
implementation as well as ongoing
 
00:57:32.910 --> 00:57:32.920 align:start position:0%
maintenance of the system this is done
 
00:57:35.230 --> 00:57:35.240 align:start position:0%
for all the states in the in the country
 
00:57:39.990 --> 00:57:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:44.470 --> 00:57:44.480 align:start position:0%
vastly unlikely that ACF would not fund
 
00:57:46.750 --> 00:57:46.760 align:start position:0%
these type of solutions for the
 
00:57:49.390 --> 00:57:49.400 align:start position:0%
different states throughout the
 
00:57:51.430 --> 00:57:51.440 align:start position:0%
country sorry Administration for
 
00:57:54.430 --> 00:57:54.440 align:start position:0%
Children and Families right so that
 
00:57:56.349 --> 00:57:56.359 align:start position:0%
that's the feds the feds are going to
 
00:58:00.589 --> 00:58:00.599 align:start position:0%
continue to pay 50% you think they have
 
00:58:02.630 --> 00:58:02.640 align:start position:0%
they have given no inking of not
 
00:58:04.270 --> 00:58:04.280 align:start position:0%
continuing that all right does that
 
00:58:07.510 --> 00:58:07.520 align:start position:0%
answer your question representative
 
00:58:09.630 --> 00:58:09.640 align:start position:0%
Daniels yeah I don't just don't know how
 
00:58:12.470 --> 00:58:12.480 align:start position:0%
much confidence I have in uh an entity
 
00:58:14.990 --> 00:58:15.000 align:start position:0%
that is trillion tens of trillions of
 
00:58:23.990 --> 00:58:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:26.630 --> 00:58:26.640 align:start position:0%
50% all right um thank you
 
00:58:27.990 --> 00:58:28.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:58:30.549 --> 00:58:30.559 align:start position:0%
to representa Mooney thank you Mr
 
00:58:32.230 --> 00:58:32.240 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for being here
 
00:58:34.390 --> 00:58:34.400 align:start position:0%
foster parents how are you doing with
 
00:58:37.190 --> 00:58:37.200 align:start position:0%
regards to uh the amount that are
 
00:58:38.990 --> 00:58:39.000 align:start position:0%
available at this point and that leads
 
00:58:40.910 --> 00:58:40.920 align:start position:0%
me to marketing I saw a very nice
 
00:58:42.390 --> 00:58:42.400 align:start position:0%
bulletin board not long ago in
 
00:58:45.510 --> 00:58:45.520 align:start position:0%
Manchester recruiting foster parents and
 
00:58:47.990 --> 00:58:48.000 align:start position:0%
I'm curious as to how marketing is
 
00:58:50.670 --> 00:58:50.680 align:start position:0%
determined uh to recruit and if that's
 
00:58:52.990 --> 00:58:53.000 align:start position:0%
worked and what the criteria would be to
 
00:58:55.430 --> 00:58:55.440 align:start position:0%
start a marketing campaign to recruit
 
00:58:57.270 --> 00:58:57.280 align:start position:0%
more Foster parents thank you thank you
 
00:59:00.230 --> 00:59:00.240 align:start position:0%
so much for asking that question um so
 
00:59:01.990 --> 00:59:02.000 align:start position:0%
foster parents are really at the heart
 
00:59:04.150 --> 00:59:04.160 align:start position:0%
as much as uh I've talked about in and
 
00:59:06.069 --> 00:59:06.079 align:start position:0%
appropriately we want to make sure that
 
00:59:09.670 --> 00:59:09.680 align:start position:0%
kids um have a first hit of getting U
 
00:59:11.510 --> 00:59:11.520 align:start position:0%
matched with one of their family because
 
00:59:12.950 --> 00:59:12.960 align:start position:0%
we know that that's good for them when
 
00:59:15.109 --> 00:59:15.119 align:start position:0%
that can't happen we need foster parents
 
00:59:17.109 --> 00:59:17.119 align:start position:0%
so important and so we need to support
 
00:59:18.829 --> 00:59:18.839 align:start position:0%
them in a couple ways we need to pay
 
00:59:20.630 --> 00:59:20.640 align:start position:0%
them appropriately and so one of the
 
00:59:21.990 --> 00:59:22.000 align:start position:0%
things that we will all be thinking
 
00:59:23.950 --> 00:59:23.960 align:start position:0%
about in this budget is the rates for
 
00:59:26.230 --> 00:59:26.240 align:start position:0%
foster care and the rates for Foster
 
00:59:28.870 --> 00:59:28.880 align:start position:0%
care are far less than the rates for
 
00:59:30.990 --> 00:59:31.000 align:start position:0%
residential care Residential Care can
 
00:59:34.710 --> 00:59:34.720 align:start position:0%
cost upwards from 300 almost $400 a day
 
00:59:38.589 --> 00:59:38.599 align:start position:0%
up to $1,800 a day and rates for foster
 
00:59:43.430 --> 00:59:43.440 align:start position:0%
care are in the 40s 50s 60s $ 70s $80 a
 
00:59:45.990 --> 00:59:46.000 align:start position:0%
day so there it is a huge difference and
 
00:59:47.390 --> 00:59:47.400 align:start position:0%
we know that kids are better cared for
 
00:59:50.470 --> 00:59:50.480 align:start position:0%
at home we have staff dedicated to doing
 
00:59:53.309 --> 00:59:53.319 align:start position:0%
that work with a foster uh care Outreach
 
00:59:55.589 --> 00:59:55.599 align:start position:0%
and marketing we can always do better we
 
00:59:58.710 --> 00:59:58.720 align:start position:0%
work really closely with organizations
 
01:00:00.789 --> 01:00:00.799 align:start position:0%
um there's a foster parent organization
 
01:00:03.309 --> 01:00:03.319 align:start position:0%
that we work hand inand with as well I
 
01:00:04.670 --> 01:00:04.680 align:start position:0%
did one of the first things that I did
 
01:00:07.270 --> 01:00:07.280 align:start position:0%
in my job when I took this um this
 
01:00:09.150 --> 01:00:09.160 align:start position:0%
particular role was go up to the North
 
01:00:11.430 --> 01:00:11.440 align:start position:0%
Country we did a phenomenal event to
 
01:00:13.470 --> 01:00:13.480 align:start position:0%
really support and bring in foster
 
01:00:16.390 --> 01:00:16.400 align:start position:0%
parents and But ultimately like all of
 
01:00:18.230 --> 01:00:18.240 align:start position:0%
us for Mom and Dad to be home you know
 
01:00:20.349 --> 01:00:20.359 align:start position:0%
someone to be home to be a foster parent
 
01:00:22.029 --> 01:00:22.039 align:start position:0%
we have to support them with a rate that
 
01:00:23.910 --> 01:00:23.920 align:start position:0%
makes sense one of the things that we
 
01:00:26.549 --> 01:00:26.559 align:start position:0%
are considering in addition or more than
 
01:00:28.990 --> 01:00:29.000 align:start position:0%
considering we're about to launch is a
 
01:00:32.710 --> 01:00:32.720 align:start position:0%
an intensive um foster care rate for
 
01:00:34.789 --> 01:00:34.799 align:start position:0%
those who are taking those children that
 
01:00:37.829 --> 01:00:37.839 align:start position:0%
are the most complex again less than it
 
01:00:39.870 --> 01:00:39.880 align:start position:0%
costs for residential care but the
 
01:00:42.270 --> 01:00:42.280 align:start position:0%
notion that we know that some of those
 
01:00:43.950 --> 01:00:43.960 align:start position:0%
um youth who've been languishing in
 
01:00:46.150 --> 01:00:46.160 align:start position:0%
residential care really would be better
 
01:00:48.630 --> 01:00:48.640 align:start position:0%
Su suited if they were home but we need
 
01:00:50.829 --> 01:00:50.839 align:start position:0%
to support families so that they can
 
01:00:53.150 --> 01:00:53.160 align:start position:0%
spend the time with that youth that's
 
01:00:55.710 --> 01:00:55.720 align:start position:0%
needed so it's you know we always need
 
01:00:55.720 --> 01:00:56.750 align:start position:0%
needed so it's you know we always need
more

01:00:56.750 --> 01:00:56.760 align:start position:0%
more
 
01:00:58.950 --> 01:00:58.960 align:start position:0%
um and we can certainly do better around
 
01:01:00.910 --> 01:01:00.920 align:start position:0%
marketing but we've put specific effort
 
01:01:02.710 --> 01:01:02.720 align:start position:0%
and put in staff in place that that's
 
01:01:04.069 --> 01:01:04.079 align:start position:0%
their whole
 
01:01:08.589 --> 01:01:08.599 align:start position:0%
job to can you Hazard a a number at uh
 
01:01:10.589 --> 01:01:10.599 align:start position:0%
capacity because I I heard in the
 
01:01:12.829 --> 01:01:12.839 align:start position:0%
implied in the question is you know
 
01:01:15.309 --> 01:01:15.319 align:start position:0%
where where are we at with our our
 
01:01:18.710 --> 01:01:18.720 align:start position:0%
perception of our total need and versus
 
01:01:20.789 --> 01:01:20.799 align:start position:0%
where we think we are with actual
 
01:01:22.789 --> 01:01:22.799 align:start position:0%
capacity so I mean if you think about
 
01:01:25.230 --> 01:01:25.240 align:start position:0%
the kids that are in those um especially
 
01:01:27.190 --> 01:01:27.200 align:start position:0%
the mid-level of care and residential
 
01:01:29.230 --> 01:01:29.240 align:start position:0%
care there those are opportunities where
 
01:01:32.430 --> 01:01:32.440 align:start position:0%
all of those kids might be better suited
 
01:01:34.390 --> 01:01:34.400 align:start position:0%
you know especially after a round of
 
01:01:37.230 --> 01:01:37.240 align:start position:0%
treatment um in a residential program in
 
01:01:39.750 --> 01:01:39.760 align:start position:0%
the community so we could use more you
 
01:01:42.589 --> 01:01:42.599 align:start position:0%
know whether that's TW you know I Hazard
 
01:01:44.870 --> 01:01:44.880 align:start position:0%
to say the exact number but I look at
 
01:01:47.109 --> 01:01:47.119 align:start position:0%
that residential number as the place
 
01:01:49.309 --> 01:01:49.319 align:start position:0%
where we don't have another place in the
 
01:01:52.269 --> 01:01:52.279 align:start position:0%
community for those kids to be right now
 
01:01:54.029 --> 01:01:54.039 align:start position:0%
um so we could just use more foster
 
01:01:57.190 --> 01:01:57.200 align:start position:0%
parents so I'm a find I need a number at
 
01:01:59.150 --> 01:01:59.160 align:start position:0%
some point we'll get you number even if
 
01:02:01.510 --> 01:02:01.520 align:start position:0%
it's a range and it's it's
 
01:02:05.269 --> 01:02:05.279 align:start position:0%
a disclaimed I I need a number uh
 
01:02:07.549 --> 01:02:07.559 align:start position:0%
representative walner did you have a
 
01:02:11.150 --> 01:02:11.160 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you so in addition to
 
01:02:13.750 --> 01:02:13.760 align:start position:0%
the rate that we pay foster parents I
 
01:02:16.549 --> 01:02:16.559 align:start position:0%
often hear from foster parents that
 
01:02:18.549 --> 01:02:18.559 align:start position:0%
there are other things they need besides
 
01:02:22.150 --> 01:02:22.160 align:start position:0%
just the rate they need maybe respit
 
01:02:23.430 --> 01:02:23.440 align:start position:0%
they may need help with some
 
01:02:25.950 --> 01:02:25.960 align:start position:0%
Transportation I mean they're all those
 
01:02:29.029 --> 01:02:29.039 align:start position:0%
kinds of things also and when you
 
01:02:32.750 --> 01:02:32.760 align:start position:0%
recruit new Foster families do they know
 
01:02:35.190 --> 01:02:35.200 align:start position:0%
what they what other kinds of services
 
01:02:37.990 --> 01:02:38.000 align:start position:0%
they can get um you know in the best
 
01:02:40.069 --> 01:02:40.079 align:start position:0%
case scenario of course we want to make
 
01:02:41.510 --> 01:02:41.520 align:start position:0%
you know we're recruiting we're trying
 
01:02:44.430 --> 01:02:44.440 align:start position:0%
to give them the op the and we also um
 
01:02:46.190 --> 01:02:46.200 align:start position:0%
connect them with other foster parents
 
01:02:47.510 --> 01:02:47.520 align:start position:0%
because we all know peer-to-peer
 
01:02:49.549 --> 01:02:49.559 align:start position:0%
learning and someone to call on the
 
01:02:51.069 --> 01:02:51.079 align:start position:0%
phone or text is probably way better
 
01:02:54.190 --> 01:02:54.200 align:start position:0%
than reaching out to the cpsw at DCF so
 
01:02:55.870 --> 01:02:55.880 align:start position:0%
we're trying to pair that and really
 
01:02:58.069 --> 01:02:58.079 align:start position:0%
wrap ourselves around those new Foster
 
01:03:00.269 --> 01:03:00.279 align:start position:0%
families so that they can succeed that
 
01:03:03.349 --> 01:03:03.359 align:start position:0%
also is um you know Con making sure that
 
01:03:05.069 --> 01:03:05.079 align:start position:0%
we are consistent among our child
 
01:03:06.589 --> 01:03:06.599 align:start position:0%
protective workers that they're really
 
01:03:09.630 --> 01:03:09.640 align:start position:0%
having that relationship and um holding
 
01:03:11.510 --> 01:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
space for those foster families so that
 
01:03:13.510 --> 01:03:13.520 align:start position:0%
we can hear those concerns you at you
 
01:03:15.309 --> 01:03:15.319 align:start position:0%
mentioned Transportation which is a huge
 
01:03:17.710 --> 01:03:17.720 align:start position:0%
issue another budget constraint of ours
 
01:03:20.309 --> 01:03:20.319 align:start position:0%
it has been many many years since we've
 
01:03:22.349 --> 01:03:22.359 align:start position:0%
increased the rate that we pay our
 
01:03:24.710 --> 01:03:24.720 align:start position:0%
transportation contractor and that's
 
01:03:26.150 --> 01:03:26.160 align:start position:0%
something that we're going to you know
 
01:03:28.349 --> 01:03:28.359 align:start position:0%
need to consider in a in an upcoming
 
01:03:29.710 --> 01:03:29.720 align:start position:0%
budget is how do we pay for
 
01:03:31.990 --> 01:03:32.000 align:start position:0%
transportation because kids need to go
 
01:03:33.950 --> 01:03:33.960 align:start position:0%
to their doctor appointment or and
 
01:03:36.150 --> 01:03:36.160 align:start position:0%
whatnot and if the family if the Foster
 
01:03:38.470 --> 01:03:38.480 align:start position:0%
family can't do that then it becomes
 
01:03:40.589 --> 01:03:40.599 align:start position:0%
incumbent on the child protective worker
 
01:03:43.109 --> 01:03:43.119 align:start position:0%
to get that youth from point A to point
 
01:03:46.390 --> 01:03:46.400 align:start position:0%
B we also want um youth to be in contact
 
01:03:48.309 --> 01:03:48.319 align:start position:0%
with their own family with the hope of
 
01:03:50.750 --> 01:03:50.760 align:start position:0%
reunification and again we need
 
01:03:53.309 --> 01:03:53.319 align:start position:0%
Transportation um we use that that
 
01:03:55.910 --> 01:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
Transportation um contractor you know
 
01:03:57.789 --> 01:03:57.799 align:start position:0%
because we pay at such a limited rate
 
01:04:00.069 --> 01:04:00.079 align:start position:0%
isn't always available to us and so
 
01:04:02.230 --> 01:04:02.240 align:start position:0%
instead we end up paying more money for
 
01:04:04.150 --> 01:04:04.160 align:start position:0%
a social worker to be The Driver as
 
01:04:06.029 --> 01:04:06.039 align:start position:0%
opposed to paying the transportation
 
01:04:10.190 --> 01:04:10.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:12.750 --> 01:04:12.760 align:start position:0%
example you've used your hour I you're
 
01:04:14.870 --> 01:04:14.880 align:start position:0%
going I know I I haven't even gotten to
 
01:04:17.309 --> 01:04:17.319 align:start position:0%
the adults yet all right representative
 
01:04:18.789 --> 01:04:18.799 align:start position:0%
that was a joke by the way
 
01:04:20.630 --> 01:04:20.640 align:start position:0%
representative well thank you and this
 
01:04:23.750 --> 01:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
won't take too long you've given us um
 
01:04:28.230 --> 01:04:28.240 align:start position:0%
the cost ranges for the Residential Care
 
01:04:31.549 --> 01:04:31.559 align:start position:0%
depending upon the need of the child the
 
01:04:36.549 --> 01:04:36.559 align:start position:0%
the the range for foster care um and we
 
01:04:39.349 --> 01:04:39.359 align:start position:0%
have kind of the the numbers on both of
 
01:04:42.269 --> 01:04:42.279 align:start position:0%
those on the community base to you have
 
01:04:46.670 --> 01:04:46.680 align:start position:0%
a number that you pay uh kin family
 
01:04:50.870 --> 01:04:50.880 align:start position:0%
members to take um a child in need so
 
01:04:53.109 --> 01:04:53.119 align:start position:0%
that's a complicated question sometimes
 
01:04:54.910 --> 01:04:54.920 align:start position:0%
um depending on the relationship but
 
01:04:57.109 --> 01:04:57.119 align:start position:0%
again there are associated with some of
 
01:04:58.309 --> 01:04:58.319 align:start position:0%
those Guardians ships and we can get
 
01:05:01.589 --> 01:05:01.599 align:start position:0%
back to you with that yeah and then um
 
01:05:03.269 --> 01:05:03.279 align:start position:0%
um I'll let Nathan read it because I
 
01:05:07.029 --> 01:05:07.039 align:start position:0%
can't read over his um sure so so there
 
01:05:08.630 --> 01:05:08.640 align:start position:0%
there there's a variety of ranges for
 
01:05:11.390 --> 01:05:11.400 align:start position:0%
foster care rates and um there's General
 
01:05:14.150 --> 01:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
foster care for ages 0 through five and
 
01:05:17.029 --> 01:05:17.039 align:start position:0%
then there's respit rates as well and
 
01:05:19.670 --> 01:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
those daily rates range from a low of
 
01:05:27.230 --> 01:05:27.240 align:start position:0%
$34 28 up to almost 50 or 6 $64 61
 
01:05:31.789 --> 01:05:31.799 align:start position:0%
sense so this is the uh kin family care
 
01:05:34.829 --> 01:05:34.839 align:start position:0%
right or is this the foster care um the
 
01:05:36.630 --> 01:05:36.640 align:start position:0%
there's I I can provide the community
 
01:05:39.150 --> 01:05:39.160 align:start position:0%
with a listing because there's there's a
 
01:05:41.150 --> 01:05:41.160 align:start position:0%
there's a matrix of detail here that you
 
01:05:42.990 --> 01:05:43.000 align:start position:0%
probably don't want me to narate but I
 
01:05:44.309 --> 01:05:44.319 align:start position:0%
can certainly send that to you so you
 
01:05:46.670 --> 01:05:46.680 align:start position:0%
can kind of see the complexity there um
 
01:05:48.950 --> 01:05:48.960 align:start position:0%
so that the rate is spec is specific for
 
01:05:51.109 --> 01:05:51.119 align:start position:0%
the particular case that would be very
 
01:05:53.190 --> 01:05:53.200 align:start position:0%
helpful thank you thank you and and you
 
01:05:55.190 --> 01:05:55.200 align:start position:0%
know to send it to Mr Ripple and he'll
 
01:05:57.870 --> 01:05:57.880 align:start position:0%
help us distribute
 
01:06:00.349 --> 01:06:00.359 align:start position:0%
it so if I fly through the rest did you
 
01:06:02.230 --> 01:06:02.240 align:start position:0%
have a question representative Daniels
 
01:06:06.589 --> 01:06:06.599 align:start position:0%
no great so as we looked to slide 16
 
01:06:08.150 --> 01:06:08.160 align:start position:0%
again this is just showing the story
 
01:06:10.269 --> 01:06:10.279 align:start position:0%
that I've told several times we have
 
01:06:12.950 --> 01:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
fewer youth um in Juvenile Justice we
 
01:06:14.710 --> 01:06:14.720 align:start position:0%
have this reduced Reliance on
 
01:06:18.029 --> 01:06:18.039 align:start position:0%
residential care and uh specif and also
 
01:06:20.069 --> 01:06:20.079 align:start position:0%
in Secure settings so you can see that
 
01:06:24.430 --> 01:06:24.440 align:start position:0%
daily count of um ju Juvenile Justice
 
01:06:27.309 --> 01:06:27.319 align:start position:0%
involved youth that number is going down
 
01:06:29.430 --> 01:06:29.440 align:start position:0%
the total number of voluntary episodes
 
01:06:31.589 --> 01:06:31.599 align:start position:0%
of treatment of Behavioral Health Care
 
01:06:33.710 --> 01:06:33.720 align:start position:0%
is going up that the numbers are less
 
01:06:36.190 --> 01:06:36.200 align:start position:0%
important is really just the the slope
 
01:06:39.990 --> 01:06:40.000 align:start position:0%
of both of those um um graphs As you
 
01:06:42.029 --> 01:06:42.039 align:start position:0%
move to slide 17 this is where we really
 
01:06:43.630 --> 01:06:43.640 align:start position:0%
see it play out at the cuno Youth
 
01:06:46.430 --> 01:06:46.440 align:start position:0%
Services Center um we've seen this
 
01:06:48.950 --> 01:06:48.960 align:start position:0%
starts in the year 2000 goes to
 
01:06:52.789 --> 01:06:52.799 align:start position:0%
2024 this radical um reduction in the
 
01:06:54.470 --> 01:06:54.480 align:start position:0%
number of Youth that are we are being
 
01:06:56.549 --> 01:06:56.559 align:start position:0%
served at the snoo Youth Services Center
 
01:06:58.589 --> 01:06:58.599 align:start position:0%
where you had over a hundred kids in
 
01:07:01.069 --> 01:07:01.079 align:start position:0%
there at a time and we're now down to
 
01:07:03.829 --> 01:07:03.839 align:start position:0%
some days single digits often times
 
01:07:06.510 --> 01:07:06.520 align:start position:0%
certainly um 15 or less is where we are
 
01:07:08.510 --> 01:07:08.520 align:start position:0%
or 18 or less and that is where we're
 
01:07:11.549 --> 01:07:11.559 align:start position:0%
moving towards with our new facility and
 
01:07:13.710 --> 01:07:13.720 align:start position:0%
so if you can flip to page uh the next
 
01:07:16.069 --> 01:07:16.079 align:start position:0%
slide on slide 18 this is just the
 
01:07:17.750 --> 01:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
graphic of the new build that's being
 
01:07:19.789 --> 01:07:19.799 align:start position:0%
built at Hamstead on the property of the
 
01:07:22.549 --> 01:07:22.559 align:start position:0%
Hamstead hospital um we're very excited
 
01:07:24.789 --> 01:07:24.799 align:start position:0%
about it ground has broken the tree
 
01:07:27.470 --> 01:07:27.480 align:start position:0%
clearing began began back in November um
 
01:07:31.069 --> 01:07:31.079 align:start position:0%
excavation started in early December um
 
01:07:32.910 --> 01:07:32.920 align:start position:0%
and we're going to have the foundation
 
01:07:34.750 --> 01:07:34.760 align:start position:0%
hopefully is going to get poured around
 
01:07:38.230 --> 01:07:38.240 align:start position:0%
February 17th so that is moving ahead
 
01:07:40.230 --> 01:07:40.240 align:start position:0%
the big machines are there things are
 
01:07:43.789 --> 01:07:43.799 align:start position:0%
happening um in in Hamstead um the
 
01:07:45.589 --> 01:07:45.599 align:start position:0%
smaller footprint we think is going to
 
01:07:48.710 --> 01:07:48.720 align:start position:0%
be as a facility less expensive to run
 
01:07:51.390 --> 01:07:51.400 align:start position:0%
the current uh cuno Youth Services
 
01:07:54.069 --> 01:07:54.079 align:start position:0%
Center is an enormous C campus and has
 
01:07:56.470 --> 01:07:56.480 align:start position:0%
the costs associated with being um a
 
01:07:58.150 --> 01:07:58.160 align:start position:0%
building that was designed to serve over
 
01:07:59.710 --> 01:07:59.720 align:start position:0%
a hundred youth when we're really
 
01:08:01.470 --> 01:08:01.480 align:start position:0%
serving a smaller number so we will have
 
01:08:04.589 --> 01:08:04.599 align:start position:0%
a smaller more efficient building um one
 
01:08:05.990 --> 01:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
of the things I know representative
 
01:08:07.910 --> 01:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
Edwards has always been interested in is
 
01:08:10.150 --> 01:08:10.160 align:start position:0%
around the shared services that we might
 
01:08:12.349 --> 01:08:12.359 align:start position:0%
get by being on the same campus next to
 
01:08:14.390 --> 01:08:14.400 align:start position:0%
Hamstead hospital we had started doing
 
01:08:17.910 --> 01:08:17.920 align:start position:0%
some of that analytic work um as we were
 
01:08:21.349 --> 01:08:21.359 align:start position:0%
planning now with um Dartmouth taking
 
01:08:24.470 --> 01:08:24.480 align:start position:0%
over and leasing the Hamstead hospital
 
01:08:26.149 --> 01:08:26.159 align:start position:0%
um some of those assump
 
01:08:28.269 --> 01:08:28.279 align:start position:0%
um need to be Revisited but it is built
 
01:08:30.789 --> 01:08:30.799 align:start position:0%
into the contract that was passed at um
 
01:08:32.309 --> 01:08:32.319 align:start position:0%
governor and Council and it is built
 
01:08:34.709 --> 01:08:34.719 align:start position:0%
into the lease with Dartmouth that we
 
01:08:37.149 --> 01:08:37.159 align:start position:0%
explore what some of those opportunities
 
01:08:40.630 --> 01:08:40.640 align:start position:0%
are the um we are restarting those
 
01:08:42.470 --> 01:08:42.480 align:start position:0%
conversations right now so I I can't
 
01:08:44.950 --> 01:08:44.960 align:start position:0%
give you specifically what the what how
 
01:08:47.309 --> 01:08:47.319 align:start position:0%
that will play out that is just in still
 
01:08:50.030 --> 01:08:50.040 align:start position:0%
in development we anticipate that that
 
01:08:52.110 --> 01:08:52.120 align:start position:0%
closing on that lease is going to happen
 
01:08:54.870 --> 01:08:54.880 align:start position:0%
in February but it's certainly an
 
01:08:58.110 --> 01:08:58.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity to um work more closely
 
01:08:59.789 --> 01:08:59.799 align:start position:0%
together on that one
 
01:09:04.070 --> 01:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
campus so um do we have a covered
 
01:09:07.550 --> 01:09:07.560 align:start position:0%
Corridor connecting Hamstead and the new
 
01:09:10.110 --> 01:09:10.120 align:start position:0%
facility um we are working towards that
 
01:09:12.309 --> 01:09:12.319 align:start position:0%
I might ask uh again Dave weers he's
 
01:09:14.070 --> 01:09:14.080 align:start position:0%
been the the clerk of the works on this
 
01:09:16.630 --> 01:09:16.640 align:start position:0%
in some regards so of where we are with
 
01:09:18.950 --> 01:09:18.960 align:start position:0%
the the collaboration Corridor as I
 
01:09:21.829 --> 01:09:21.839 align:start position:0%
think it was called or or or culture
 
01:09:26.149 --> 01:09:26.159 align:start position:0%
Corridor I better that I like that um
 
01:09:28.390 --> 01:09:28.400 align:start position:0%
but that's really critical to the
 
01:09:32.390 --> 01:09:32.400 align:start position:0%
success because not only um is that a a
 
01:09:34.550 --> 01:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
physical sign of the relationship
 
01:09:36.070 --> 01:09:36.080 align:start position:0%
between the two buildings but if you're
 
01:09:38.430 --> 01:09:38.440 align:start position:0%
moving food and laundry back and forth
 
01:09:40.510 --> 01:09:40.520 align:start position:0%
you actually need some cover right and
 
01:09:42.349 --> 01:09:42.359 align:start position:0%
then I'll come to you next um
 
01:09:42.359 --> 01:09:46.390 align:start position:0%
then I'll come to you next um
representative

01:09:46.390 --> 01:09:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:49.590 --> 01:09:49.600 align:start position:0%
torki um thank you for the question um
 
01:09:52.110 --> 01:09:52.120 align:start position:0%
in regards to a covered walkway between
 
01:09:54.350 --> 01:09:54.360 align:start position:0%
the two facilities we would still need
 
01:09:56.990 --> 01:09:57.000 align:start position:0%
to find funding to do that so it is not
 
01:09:59.709 --> 01:09:59.719 align:start position:0%
currently in the scope of work for the
 
01:10:02.990 --> 01:10:03.000 align:start position:0%
build so so you know the word walkway is
 
01:10:07.390 --> 01:10:07.400 align:start position:0%
is verboten we're talking corridors
 
01:10:10.390 --> 01:10:10.400 align:start position:0%
or a corridor is and you still need M
 
01:10:12.750 --> 01:10:12.760 align:start position:0%
money yes we do still need fund where
 
01:10:14.590 --> 01:10:14.600 align:start position:0%
where are you requesting the money is it
 
01:10:16.950 --> 01:10:16.960 align:start position:0%
in the budget is it a priority need is
 
01:10:20.350 --> 01:10:20.360 align:start position:0%
it what is it it it's just what is it it
 
01:10:22.550 --> 01:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
it currently is not in either a
 
01:10:26.590 --> 01:10:26.600 align:start position:0%
prioritized need or in the budget
 
01:10:29.189 --> 01:10:29.199 align:start position:0%
so you're not asking for
 
01:10:31.510 --> 01:10:31.520 align:start position:0%
money we we currently do not have a
 
01:10:33.270 --> 01:10:33.280 align:start position:0%
formal request in the agency budget that
 
01:10:35.669 --> 01:10:35.679 align:start position:0%
was submitted back in August okay so if
 
01:10:37.390 --> 01:10:37.400 align:start position:0%
you're not asking for money it's not
 
01:10:39.430 --> 01:10:39.440 align:start position:0%
going to happen is what I'm I'm I'm
 
01:10:43.110 --> 01:10:43.120 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm being simple so um pardon me
 
01:10:45.750 --> 01:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
Marissa hen Deputy Commissioner so back
 
01:10:48.790 --> 01:10:48.800 align:start position:0%
in November December we came to you all
 
01:10:51.030 --> 01:10:51.040 align:start position:0%
um I believe actually former Governor
 
01:10:52.990 --> 01:10:53.000 align:start position:0%
tunu actually attended the fiscal
 
01:10:57.390 --> 01:10:57.400 align:start position:0%
committee um where some of the remaining
 
01:11:00.350 --> 01:11:00.360 align:start position:0%
um uh recovery dollars arpa dollars were
 
01:11:03.030 --> 01:11:03.040 align:start position:0%
uh redeployed toward this project um as
 
01:11:05.070 --> 01:11:05.080 align:start position:0%
you know uh this project requires use of
 
01:11:07.790 --> 01:11:07.800 align:start position:0%
arpa dollars and and or federal dollars
 
01:11:10.950 --> 01:11:10.960 align:start position:0%
and cannot use General funds so um when
 
01:11:13.669 --> 01:11:13.679 align:start position:0%
we went out to bid on the contract with
 
01:11:16.510 --> 01:11:16.520 align:start position:0%
um with the with the construction firms
 
01:11:19.510 --> 01:11:19.520 align:start position:0%
we had them scope out the work for that
 
01:11:22.070 --> 01:11:22.080 align:start position:0%
um culture Corridor um as you've called
 
01:11:24.070 --> 01:11:24.080 align:start position:0%
it so they're definitely it's it's we
 
01:11:27.229 --> 01:11:27.239 align:start position:0%
are it's theoretically capable of being
 
01:11:29.750 --> 01:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
um uh integrated into the contract the
 
01:11:32.350 --> 01:11:32.360 align:start position:0%
challenge is under HB 49 um we C we
 
01:11:34.310 --> 01:11:34.320 align:start position:0%
cannot use General funds toward this
 
01:11:36.990 --> 01:11:37.000 align:start position:0%
build so that limits our ability to come
 
01:11:39.270 --> 01:11:39.280 align:start position:0%
to you to ask for additional funding for
 
01:11:39.280 --> 01:11:40.790 align:start position:0%
to you to ask for additional funding for
the

01:11:40.790 --> 01:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:11:42.790 --> 01:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
build all right we should take it
 
01:11:44.910 --> 01:11:44.920 align:start position:0%
offline but yeah but so let's talk more
 
01:11:47.189 --> 01:11:47.199 align:start position:0%
I think we you have been a a huge
 
01:11:50.030 --> 01:11:50.040 align:start position:0%
advocate um representative Edwards and
 
01:11:52.189 --> 01:11:52.199 align:start position:0%
uh we share as you and I have had many
 
01:11:53.750 --> 01:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
conversations about the importance
 
01:11:57.110 --> 01:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
symbolically practically efficiency wise
 
01:11:59.229 --> 01:11:59.239 align:start position:0%
so we are do you know the new governor
 
01:12:01.709 --> 01:12:01.719 align:start position:0%
is aware of the issue we are continuing
 
01:12:03.430 --> 01:12:03.440 align:start position:0%
to keep her briefed on all aspects of
 
01:12:05.629 --> 01:12:05.639 align:start position:0%
the construction um and so I think this
 
01:12:08.830 --> 01:12:08.840 align:start position:0%
particular narrow pet peeve issue I
 
01:12:10.510 --> 01:12:10.520 align:start position:0%
can't speak to her specific there's a
 
01:12:12.110 --> 01:12:12.120 align:start position:0%
lot of details in this project including
 
01:12:14.350 --> 01:12:14.360 align:start position:0%
about 30 ad alternate components this is
 
01:12:16.510 --> 01:12:16.520 align:start position:0%
one of which so let's connect offline
 
01:12:18.950 --> 01:12:18.960 align:start position:0%
about whether or not we we do that thank
 
01:12:21.590 --> 01:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Dr hen uh representative
 
01:12:23.750 --> 01:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
tki I'm not sure if this is going to be
 
01:12:25.629 --> 01:12:25.639 align:start position:0%
addressed further down the right down
 
01:12:27.470 --> 01:12:27.480 align:start position:0%
the road when we actually have numbers
 
01:12:29.430 --> 01:12:29.440 align:start position:0%
in front of us and we talk about this
 
01:12:31.110 --> 01:12:31.120 align:start position:0%
project in particular which is fine we
 
01:12:32.990 --> 01:12:33.000 align:start position:0%
can talk about it then but I have a
 
01:12:36.950 --> 01:12:36.960 align:start position:0%
memory of this fall perhaps a discussion
 
01:12:39.590 --> 01:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
that there was an attempt to expand the
 
01:12:41.510 --> 01:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
scope and the number of beds for the
 
01:12:44.590 --> 01:12:44.600 align:start position:0%
facility and is that something that I
 
01:12:46.910 --> 01:12:46.920 align:start position:0%
misunderstood or thank you so there were
 
01:12:49.149 --> 01:12:49.159 align:start position:0%
a lot of conversations when this um
 
01:12:50.830 --> 01:12:50.840 align:start position:0%
project went to governor and Council in
 
01:12:56.669 --> 01:12:56.679 align:start position:0%
the fall um the the letter noted a a bed
 
01:12:58.870 --> 01:12:58.880 align:start position:0%
count higher than what was expected of
 
01:13:02.270 --> 01:13:02.280 align:start position:0%
the 12 bed the 12 youth census that we
 
01:13:05.350 --> 01:13:05.360 align:start position:0%
were talking about so the the um
 
01:13:08.229 --> 01:13:08.239 align:start position:0%
strategy is still the same our goal is
 
01:13:11.669 --> 01:13:11.679 align:start position:0%
to have a facility that serves 12 youth
 
01:13:13.669 --> 01:13:13.679 align:start position:0%
in order to do that you actually need
 
01:13:17.070 --> 01:13:17.080 align:start position:0%
more physical beds than 12 beds so that
 
01:13:19.950 --> 01:13:19.960 align:start position:0%
you need to have a place for isolation
 
01:13:21.870 --> 01:13:21.880 align:start position:0%
for you know for illness you need to
 
01:13:23.550 --> 01:13:23.560 align:start position:0%
have isolation you need to be able to
 
01:13:26.149 --> 01:13:26.159 align:start position:0%
separate boys and girls in certain ways
 
01:13:28.950 --> 01:13:28.960 align:start position:0%
so that that the phys the furniture
 
01:13:31.709 --> 01:13:31.719 align:start position:0%
needs to be more than 12 but the intent
 
01:13:34.870 --> 01:13:34.880 align:start position:0%
is to serve no more than 12 just so that
 
01:13:37.750 --> 01:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
you can separate as needed okay so that
 
01:13:40.070 --> 01:13:40.080 align:start position:0%
was just a problem in interpreting yes
 
01:13:43.830 --> 01:13:43.840 align:start position:0%
the language thank you I I i' I'd add a
 
01:13:47.830 --> 01:13:47.840 align:start position:0%
little more it's always been 12 is the
 
01:13:51.310 --> 01:13:51.320 align:start position:0%
goal with a surge capacity of up to 18
 
01:13:53.510 --> 01:13:53.520 align:start position:0%
and the ability to be flexible within
 
01:13:55.910 --> 01:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
that uh for a little while there was
 
01:13:58.390 --> 01:13:58.400 align:start position:0%
some bad miscommunication that led the
 
01:14:00.030 --> 01:14:00.040 align:start position:0%
community to believe that we were going
 
01:14:03.709 --> 01:14:03.719 align:start position:0%
to violate the 18 ceiling but that was
 
01:14:05.510 --> 01:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
never the case that was just bad
 
01:14:08.270 --> 01:14:08.280 align:start position:0%
communication so it it it it's 12
 
01:14:11.350 --> 01:14:11.360 align:start position:0%
Baseline surge up to 18 is still the
 
01:14:13.229 --> 01:14:13.239 align:start position:0%
plan and I'm glad I asked the question
 
01:14:14.870 --> 01:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
so I can understand better yeah yeah no
 
01:14:17.550 --> 01:14:17.560 align:start position:0%
no I'm glad you did yes and again lots
 
01:14:19.310 --> 01:14:19.320 align:start position:0%
of miscommunications around things like
 
01:14:21.470 --> 01:14:21.480 align:start position:0%
just physical furniture that it takes to
 
01:14:23.750 --> 01:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
serve that number of Youth
 
01:14:25.790 --> 01:14:25.800 align:start position:0%
representative Daniels
 
01:14:29.709 --> 01:14:29.719 align:start position:0%
thank you um recently there was uh as we
 
01:14:31.310 --> 01:14:31.320 align:start position:0%
all know something going on with
 
01:14:33.350 --> 01:14:33.360 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth and an individual who needed a
 
01:14:35.709 --> 01:14:35.719 align:start position:0%
kidney transplant and they refused them
 
01:14:38.590 --> 01:14:38.600 align:start position:0%
and then they later uh revers their
 
01:14:41.510 --> 01:14:41.520 align:start position:0%
position do we know with certainty that
 
01:14:44.470 --> 01:14:44.480 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth Hitchcock will not turn away
 
01:14:46.229 --> 01:14:46.239 align:start position:0%
uh individuals who are going to be
 
01:14:48.430 --> 01:14:48.440 align:start position:0%
housed here if they have not been
 
01:14:51.510 --> 01:14:51.520 align:start position:0%
vaccinated that would not be any um
 
01:14:54.430 --> 01:14:54.440 align:start position:0%
practice that we would encourage it it
 
01:14:56.629 --> 01:14:56.639 align:start position:0%
that has not come up at all it would not
 
01:14:59.070 --> 01:14:59.080 align:start position:0%
be uh it is not within any of our
 
01:15:00.990 --> 01:15:01.000 align:start position:0%
contracts it we would expect them let me
 
01:15:02.470 --> 01:15:02.480 align:start position:0%
reframe that we would expect them to
 
01:15:04.110 --> 01:15:04.120 align:start position:0%
serve all youth no matter whether they
 
01:15:06.270 --> 01:15:06.280 align:start position:0%
were vaccinated or not so that's the
 
01:15:07.950 --> 01:15:07.960 align:start position:0%
better way I say so while while you are
 
01:15:10.189 --> 01:15:10.199 align:start position:0%
negotiating with with Dartmouth is there
 
01:15:12.110 --> 01:15:12.120 align:start position:0%
going to be a clause in the contract
 
01:15:14.310 --> 01:15:14.320 align:start position:0%
that says that you are you are to follow
 
01:15:16.430 --> 01:15:16.440 align:start position:0%
all of the state laws I'm going to let
 
01:15:18.629 --> 01:15:18.639 align:start position:0%
um uh Deputy Commissioner answer that
 
01:15:20.030 --> 01:15:20.040 align:start position:0%
great but yes the answer is they will
 
01:15:22.189 --> 01:15:22.199 align:start position:0%
follow all state laws great and just to
 
01:15:24.990 --> 01:15:25.000 align:start position:0%
clarify so Dartmouth Health um with the
 
01:15:26.510 --> 01:15:26.520 align:start position:0%
closing that is expected to take place
 
01:15:28.350 --> 01:15:28.360 align:start position:0%
in a matter of days um Dartmouth health
 
01:15:31.189 --> 01:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
is taking over the uh the operation and
 
01:15:33.270 --> 01:15:33.280 align:start position:0%
administration of Hamstead hospital so I
 
01:15:34.629 --> 01:15:34.639 align:start position:0%
just want to be clear about that while
 
01:15:37.910 --> 01:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
that campus will be home to um uh in the
 
01:15:40.709 --> 01:15:40.719 align:start position:0%
future to YDC once the Manchester campus
 
01:15:42.590 --> 01:15:42.600 align:start position:0%
closes and while Dartmouth is an
 
01:15:45.070 --> 01:15:45.080 align:start position:0%
important partner at YDC um what we're
 
01:15:46.390 --> 01:15:46.400 align:start position:0%
talking about in terms of this public
 
01:15:47.830 --> 01:15:47.840 align:start position:0%
private private partnership is a
 
01:15:50.229 --> 01:15:50.239 align:start position:0%
psychiatric um impatient facility and
 
01:15:53.110 --> 01:15:53.120 align:start position:0%
residential treatment uh Center and in
 
01:15:54.510 --> 01:15:54.520 align:start position:0%
the lease um we have a number of
 
01:15:57.910 --> 01:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
mechanisms to ensure uh to oversee that
 
01:15:59.310 --> 01:15:59.320 align:start position:0%
facility but one of them is a
 
01:16:01.550 --> 01:16:01.560 align:start position:0%
requirement to comply with all federal
 
01:16:04.870 --> 01:16:04.880 align:start position:0%
state laws extensive um prohibitions
 
01:16:06.510 --> 01:16:06.520 align:start position:0%
around discrimination and so we feel
 
01:16:08.390 --> 01:16:08.400 align:start position:0%
confident that there will be um no
 
01:16:11.189 --> 01:16:11.199 align:start position:0%
issues uh uh around what you're
 
01:16:12.590 --> 01:16:12.600 align:start position:0%
describing and that will continue to
 
01:16:16.390 --> 01:16:16.400 align:start position:0%
stay very involved as the um as the
 
01:16:18.629 --> 01:16:18.639 align:start position:0%
entity that oversees Healthcare facility
 
01:16:20.629 --> 01:16:20.639 align:start position:0%
licensing but also as the landlord and
 
01:16:22.790 --> 01:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
the the owner of that um physical
 
01:16:25.990 --> 01:16:26.000 align:start position:0%
facility thank Youk I I I'd like to
 
01:16:27.669 --> 01:16:27.679 align:start position:0%
throw in another little piece to this
 
01:16:27.679 --> 01:16:29.270 align:start position:0%
throw in another little piece to this
puzzle

01:16:29.270 --> 01:16:29.280 align:start position:0%
puzzle
 
01:16:32.229 --> 01:16:32.239 align:start position:0%
um Mr Ripple is helping me I think with
 
01:16:36.470 --> 01:16:36.480 align:start position:0%
an hb2 item that basically will require
 
01:16:39.310 --> 01:16:39.320 align:start position:0%
the state to uh only contract with
 
01:16:42.550 --> 01:16:42.560 align:start position:0%
hospitals that comply with the statute
 
01:16:45.110 --> 01:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
around the patient Bill of Rights an a
 
01:16:47.510 --> 01:16:47.520 align:start position:0%
component of the patient Bill of Rights
 
01:16:52.110 --> 01:16:52.120 align:start position:0%
is is the vaccination issue so so the
 
01:16:54.510 --> 01:16:54.520 align:start position:0%
Department's already on top of it and
 
01:16:57.470 --> 01:16:57.480 align:start position:0%
I'm opening to put something into hb2 so
 
01:16:59.830 --> 01:16:59.840 align:start position:0%
that uh that it'll just be routine that
 
01:17:01.870 --> 01:17:01.880 align:start position:0%
when we contract that we contract with
 
01:17:03.830 --> 01:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
the expectation that the patient Bill of
 
01:17:08.149 --> 01:17:08.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:10.229 --> 01:17:10.239 align:start position:0%
followed representative Mooney thank you
 
01:17:11.430 --> 01:17:11.440 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and thank you while I'm
 
01:17:12.830 --> 01:17:12.840 align:start position:0%
thinking of it and while we're on the
 
01:17:15.870 --> 01:17:15.880 align:start position:0%
topic of the new YDC facility as I
 
01:17:19.669 --> 01:17:19.679 align:start position:0%
recall last term we appropriated a
 
01:17:19.679 --> 01:17:20.870 align:start position:0%
recall last term we appropriated a
rather

01:17:20.870 --> 01:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
rather
 
01:17:24.070 --> 01:17:24.080 align:start position:0%
costly uh searching machine similar to
 
01:17:26.590 --> 01:17:26.600 align:start position:0%
what you would see in a
 
01:17:28.990 --> 01:17:29.000 align:start position:0%
airport yes just want to be sure that
 
01:17:32.110 --> 01:17:32.120 align:start position:0%
that machine follows the construction
 
01:17:34.350 --> 01:17:34.360 align:start position:0%
yes I can imagine it's quite large and
 
01:17:38.030 --> 01:17:38.040 align:start position:0%
there's placement for it thank you thank
 
01:17:42.189 --> 01:17:42.199 align:start position:0%
you all right thank you um slide 19 just
 
01:17:44.030 --> 01:17:44.040 align:start position:0%
uh Lo looks a little bit about the
 
01:17:46.270 --> 01:17:46.280 align:start position:0%
workforce and sort of again some of what
 
01:17:48.870 --> 01:17:48.880 align:start position:0%
we anticipate what our current positions
 
01:17:51.270 --> 01:17:51.280 align:start position:0%
are at YDC what we anticipate the new
 
01:17:53.189 --> 01:17:53.199 align:start position:0%
this is a mix of both state positions
 
01:17:56.229 --> 01:17:56.239 align:start position:0%
and contracted positions so this isn't a
 
01:17:58.629 --> 01:17:58.639 align:start position:0%
full-time you know uh you know these
 
01:18:00.350 --> 01:18:00.360 align:start position:0%
aren't all full-time positions that are
 
01:18:02.229 --> 01:18:02.239 align:start position:0%
in the state they're noted some of them
 
01:18:04.510 --> 01:18:04.520 align:start position:0%
are contracted some are there but really
 
01:18:06.310 --> 01:18:06.320 align:start position:0%
around to this notion of what's it going
 
01:18:08.870 --> 01:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
to take to run the new center they are
 
01:18:11.149 --> 01:18:11.159 align:start position:0%
similar in number there are
 
01:18:13.950 --> 01:18:13.960 align:start position:0%
opportunities again as we work with um
 
01:18:16.430 --> 01:18:16.440 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth at Hamstead Hospital not at
 
01:18:19.149 --> 01:18:19.159 align:start position:0%
YDC to see where we have some um further
 
01:18:21.149 --> 01:18:21.159 align:start position:0%
opportunities for shared services I
 
01:18:23.629 --> 01:18:23.639 align:start position:0%
noted at the top we have an unbudgeted
 
01:18:25.430 --> 01:18:25.440 align:start position:0%
Vision which is a something that I know
 
01:18:26.950 --> 01:18:26.960 align:start position:0%
that is near and dear to repres
 
01:18:29.510 --> 01:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
representative Edward's heart around
 
01:18:31.390 --> 01:18:31.400 align:start position:0%
thinking about security and so we have
 
01:18:33.310 --> 01:18:33.320 align:start position:0%
not yet built that into our budget to
 
01:18:35.910 --> 01:18:35.920 align:start position:0%
figure out how to do that um
 
01:18:37.990 --> 01:18:38.000 align:start position:0%
understanding that our our pie is only
 
01:18:40.430 --> 01:18:40.440 align:start position:0%
so big at this moment but here's what it
 
01:18:43.110 --> 01:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
would take what we think is the number
 
01:18:46.590 --> 01:18:46.600 align:start position:0%
anticipated to run the new facility
 
01:18:48.870 --> 01:18:48.880 align:start position:0%
appropriately so so I just have the
 
01:18:51.229 --> 01:18:51.239 align:start position:0%
comment that just be consistent over the
 
01:18:54.870 --> 01:18:54.880 align:start position:0%
last three years or so the this still
 
01:18:56.709 --> 01:18:56.719 align:start position:0%
makes it look like security is an
 
01:18:59.390 --> 01:18:59.400 align:start position:0%
afterthought or a bolt-on this is first
 
01:19:02.870 --> 01:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
and foremost a secure facility in which
 
01:19:07.229 --> 01:19:07.239 align:start position:0%
we provide good clinical care and so
 
01:19:09.910 --> 01:19:09.920 align:start position:0%
it's it's a it's a little disturbing to
 
01:19:13.950 --> 01:19:13.960 align:start position:0%
see a security team listed here as an
 
01:19:17.470 --> 01:19:17.480 align:start position:0%
add-on instead of an integrated element
 
01:19:19.390 --> 01:19:19.400 align:start position:0%
of of the
 
01:19:22.510 --> 01:19:22.520 align:start position:0%
team I I I think what's important to
 
01:19:24.910 --> 01:19:24.920 align:start position:0%
understand is that we prepared our our
 
01:19:28.590 --> 01:19:28.600 align:start position:0%
budget um almost 6 months ago and there
 
01:19:30.709 --> 01:19:30.719 align:start position:0%
have been a lot of ongoing conversations
 
01:19:32.149 --> 01:19:32.159 align:start position:0%
for some time there's been a team
 
01:19:33.870 --> 01:19:33.880 align:start position:0%
looking at the transition and what the
 
01:19:36.430 --> 01:19:36.440 align:start position:0%
new setup would look like there so when
 
01:19:38.669 --> 01:19:38.679 align:start position:0%
we prepared our original budget we
 
01:19:41.350 --> 01:19:41.360 align:start position:0%
didn't have those those specific issues
 
01:19:43.629 --> 01:19:43.639 align:start position:0%
finalized and those are the issues that
 
01:19:45.110 --> 01:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
we'll be working with with this
 
01:19:46.950 --> 01:19:46.960 align:start position:0%
committee and others in the future on
 
01:19:48.510 --> 01:19:48.520 align:start position:0%
yes and I just wanted to be transparent
 
01:19:50.189 --> 01:19:50.199 align:start position:0%
that they're not in the budget right
 
01:19:53.590 --> 01:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
now thank you so um I am looking at the
 
01:19:55.110 --> 01:19:55.120 align:start position:0%
time and I'm looking to the chair should
 
01:19:59.550 --> 01:19:59.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:01.669 --> 01:20:01.679 align:start position:0%
adults I think everything you've said
 
01:20:04.149 --> 01:20:04.159 align:start position:0%
has been useful and uh if you're
 
01:20:06.470 --> 01:20:06.480 align:start position:0%
prepared to talk more about this slide
 
01:20:08.350 --> 01:20:08.360 align:start position:0%
deck let's keep going all right thank
 
01:20:10.430 --> 01:20:10.440 align:start position:0%
you so much so let's talk about adults
 
01:20:11.870 --> 01:20:11.880 align:start position:0%
now in our community mental health
 
01:20:14.430 --> 01:20:14.440 align:start position:0%
system just as sort of Baseline for
 
01:20:18.390 --> 01:20:18.400 align:start position:0%
everyone we have a safety net of um 10
 
01:20:20.550 --> 01:20:20.560 align:start position:0%
Community Mental Health centers around
 
01:20:23.470 --> 01:20:23.480 align:start position:0%
the state they are designated in statute
 
01:20:25.750 --> 01:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
as to the work that they provide or the
 
01:20:28.669 --> 01:20:28.679 align:start position:0%
services they provide primarily for a
 
01:20:31.110 --> 01:20:31.120 align:start position:0%
lowincome population for individuals who
 
01:20:33.590 --> 01:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
are on Medicaid and individuals with
 
01:20:37.070 --> 01:20:37.080 align:start position:0%
severe um mental health conditions and
 
01:20:40.149 --> 01:20:40.159 align:start position:0%
so those are around um they provide case
 
01:20:42.070 --> 01:20:42.080 align:start position:0%
management and medication all of the
 
01:20:44.709 --> 01:20:44.719 align:start position:0%
resources that you could imagine that
 
01:20:46.550 --> 01:20:46.560 align:start position:0%
those mental health uh the mental health
 
01:20:48.709 --> 01:20:48.719 align:start position:0%
need to meet mental health needs within
 
01:20:52.950 --> 01:20:52.960 align:start position:0%
our state um not only do we work with
 
01:20:55.270 --> 01:20:55.280 align:start position:0%
the mental health centers themselves
 
01:20:57.390 --> 01:20:57.400 align:start position:0%
we also have peer support agencies we
 
01:21:00.149 --> 01:21:00.159 align:start position:0%
have Family mutual support we're really
 
01:21:02.790 --> 01:21:02.800 align:start position:0%
building a system to make sure that we
 
01:21:05.030 --> 01:21:05.040 align:start position:0%
can support individuals in their
 
01:21:07.590 --> 01:21:07.600 align:start position:0%
Community the theme throughout for today
 
01:21:10.149 --> 01:21:10.159 align:start position:0%
is really how can we keep people
 
01:21:13.950 --> 01:21:13.960 align:start position:0%
Everyone kids adults home safe and cared
 
01:21:16.030 --> 01:21:16.040 align:start position:0%
for within their community so that they
 
01:21:18.830 --> 01:21:18.840 align:start position:0%
can be as productive as possible I'm
 
01:21:20.350 --> 01:21:20.360 align:start position:0%
going to fly through a little of these
 
01:21:21.709 --> 01:21:21.719 align:start position:0%
because I I know that we are a little
 
01:21:24.270 --> 01:21:24.280 align:start position:0%
bit short on time um it's important to
 
01:21:27.229 --> 01:21:27.239 align:start position:0%
know that we serve around 60,000 just
 
01:21:30.149 --> 01:21:30.159 align:start position:0%
shy of 60,000 individuals a year through
 
01:21:32.430 --> 01:21:32.440 align:start position:0%
the community mental health system so
 
01:21:34.110 --> 01:21:34.120 align:start position:0%
that's a large number those are your
 
01:21:36.990 --> 01:21:37.000 align:start position:0%
constituents who are being served um by
 
01:21:39.590 --> 01:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
our cmhc's we have seen consistent
 
01:21:43.270 --> 01:21:43.280 align:start position:0%
growth in that over time um and uh we
 
01:21:46.229 --> 01:21:46.239 align:start position:0%
noted today this morning at fiscal um we
 
01:21:48.870 --> 01:21:48.880 align:start position:0%
our department um dashboard looks a
 
01:21:50.629 --> 01:21:50.639 align:start position:0%
little stagnant that's really only
 
01:21:53.590 --> 01:21:53.600 align:start position:0%
because two of our larger um Community
 
01:21:55.110 --> 01:21:55.120 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Systems are going through
 
01:21:57.350 --> 01:21:57.360 align:start position:0%
an electronic health record conversion
 
01:21:58.830 --> 01:21:58.840 align:start position:0%
they haven't sent us their numbers in
 
01:21:59.990 --> 01:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
the way that we would hope as they're
 
01:22:01.590 --> 01:22:01.600 align:start position:0%
going through that conversion but we
 
01:22:04.149 --> 01:22:04.159 align:start position:0%
continue continue to see you know a
 
01:22:07.910 --> 01:22:07.920 align:start position:0%
plateau of um and growth um in services
 
01:22:09.709 --> 01:22:09.719 align:start position:0%
and and folks being served within those
 
01:22:12.629 --> 01:22:12.639 align:start position:0%
communities representative Edwards noted
 
01:22:15.669 --> 01:22:15.679 align:start position:0%
that um we it all went through the
 
01:22:18.470 --> 01:22:18.480 align:start position:0%
Medicaid unwind at the end of the
 
01:22:22.030 --> 01:22:22.040 align:start position:0%
pandemic that was particularly felt by
 
01:22:24.229 --> 01:22:24.239 align:start position:0%
the Community Mental Health Centers a
 
01:22:25.990 --> 01:22:26.000 align:start position:0%
number number of their in of the folks
 
01:22:28.590 --> 01:22:28.600 align:start position:0%
that they treat had been on Medicaid
 
01:22:30.430 --> 01:22:30.440 align:start position:0%
uninterrupted for a number of years
 
01:22:32.550 --> 01:22:32.560 align:start position:0%
through the pandemic as the unwind
 
01:22:35.189 --> 01:22:35.199 align:start position:0%
happened they were continuing to to
 
01:22:37.470 --> 01:22:37.480 align:start position:0%
receive care there when they may no
 
01:22:40.189 --> 01:22:40.199 align:start position:0%
longer have had Medicaid and so that has
 
01:22:42.950 --> 01:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
had a financial impact on our community
 
01:22:45.790 --> 01:22:45.800 align:start position:0%
mental health centers even though that
 
01:22:47.790 --> 01:22:47.800 align:start position:0%
is happening and they have our community
 
01:22:49.510 --> 01:22:49.520 align:start position:0%
mental health centers have been serving
 
01:22:51.669 --> 01:22:51.679 align:start position:0%
all the individuals they need to serve
 
01:22:53.830 --> 01:22:53.840 align:start position:0%
we have also done some great things
 
01:22:55.590 --> 01:22:55.600 align:start position:0%
around real really building issues
 
01:22:57.709 --> 01:22:57.719 align:start position:0%
around rapid response it's something
 
01:22:59.350 --> 01:22:59.360 align:start position:0%
that I know that many of you have heard
 
01:23:02.870 --> 01:23:02.880 align:start position:0%
of which is this notion of having a
 
01:23:04.310 --> 01:23:04.320 align:start position:0%
you'll you'll hear themes to what we
 
01:23:06.430 --> 01:23:06.440 align:start position:0%
were talking about with kids you know
 
01:23:09.430 --> 01:23:09.440 align:start position:0%
someone to answer someone to respond and
 
01:23:11.709 --> 01:23:11.719 align:start position:0%
somewhere to go this has been an
 
01:23:14.110 --> 01:23:14.120 align:start position:0%
incredibly important addition to Our
 
01:23:16.229 --> 01:23:16.239 align:start position:0%
Community Mental Health Services making
 
01:23:19.430 --> 01:23:19.440 align:start position:0%
sure that we have um a place to answer
 
01:23:23.950 --> 01:23:23.960 align:start position:0%
questions to um meet needs far away from
 
01:23:26.550 --> 01:23:26.560 align:start position:0%
hospital emergency rooms when possible
 
01:23:28.790 --> 01:23:28.800 align:start position:0%
so that we can meet those needs um in
 
01:23:31.270 --> 01:23:31.280 align:start position:0%
the community and we can help folks get
 
01:23:34.350 --> 01:23:34.360 align:start position:0%
stabilized there the growth in um rapid
 
01:23:35.950 --> 01:23:35.960 align:start position:0%
response we've seen that continue to
 
01:23:39.110 --> 01:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
grow since it was brought online in 2021
 
01:23:42.350 --> 01:23:42.360 align:start position:0%
we continue to see that move forward and
 
01:23:44.709 --> 01:23:44.719 align:start position:0%
have that centralized access point
 
01:23:46.149 --> 01:23:46.159 align:start position:0%
really work it's one of the things that
 
01:23:48.310 --> 01:23:48.320 align:start position:0%
we're proudest of um over the past
 
01:23:51.350 --> 01:23:51.360 align:start position:0%
couple years in our mental health system
 
01:23:54.990 --> 01:23:55.000 align:start position:0%
um if you flip to page uh to slide 26
 
01:23:56.629 --> 01:23:56.639 align:start position:0%
this is another one of these big boxes
 
01:23:57.990 --> 01:23:58.000 align:start position:0%
where it looks like I'm yelling at you
 
01:23:59.870 --> 01:23:59.880 align:start position:0%
because I'm I really want to break this
 
01:24:02.590 --> 01:24:02.600 align:start position:0%
point known um that eight out of 10 of
 
01:24:04.149 --> 01:24:04.159 align:start position:0%
our community mental health centers
 
01:24:07.590 --> 01:24:07.600 align:start position:0%
report operational losses right now um
 
01:24:10.669 --> 01:24:10.679 align:start position:0%
they uh like our federally qualified
 
01:24:13.629 --> 01:24:13.639 align:start position:0%
Health Centers um that do primary care
 
01:24:15.870 --> 01:24:15.880 align:start position:0%
and traditional Medical Care our
 
01:24:19.189 --> 01:24:19.199 align:start position:0%
community mental health um centers have
 
01:24:22.110 --> 01:24:22.120 align:start position:0%
felt the sting of that Medicaid unwind
 
01:24:24.950 --> 01:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
and the end of the pandemic um both the
 
01:24:27.070 --> 01:24:27.080 align:start position:0%
federally qualified Health Centers and
 
01:24:29.110 --> 01:24:29.120 align:start position:0%
the Community Mental Health Centers
 
01:24:31.950 --> 01:24:31.960 align:start position:0%
receive some additional arpa funds um to
 
01:24:34.910 --> 01:24:34.920 align:start position:0%
help support them as we were going
 
01:24:36.189 --> 01:24:36.199 align:start position:0%
through these
 
01:24:38.669 --> 01:24:38.679 align:start position:0%
transitions this slide is to note that
 
01:24:40.430 --> 01:24:40.440 align:start position:0%
there are still they are still
 
01:24:42.590 --> 01:24:42.600 align:start position:0%
experiencing some of those losses and
 
01:24:44.830 --> 01:24:44.840 align:start position:0%
it's really from three big bucket areas
 
01:24:46.950 --> 01:24:46.960 align:start position:0%
it's around uncompensated care it's
 
01:24:49.229 --> 01:24:49.239 align:start position:0%
around the C the increasing cost of
 
01:24:52.109 --> 01:24:52.119 align:start position:0%
Workforce as well as the availability of
 
01:24:54.830 --> 01:24:54.840 align:start position:0%
Workforce and then overall the cost that
 
01:24:57.149 --> 01:24:57.159 align:start position:0%
we all feel every day of heat and
 
01:24:58.750 --> 01:24:58.760 align:start position:0%
keeping buildings running and keeping
 
01:25:00.750 --> 01:25:00.760 align:start position:0%
the lights on all of those things have
 
01:25:03.109 --> 01:25:03.119 align:start position:0%
contributed to those operational losses
 
01:25:05.030 --> 01:25:05.040 align:start position:0%
the workforce in particular I know we've
 
01:25:06.870 --> 01:25:06.880 align:start position:0%
been talking about Workforce for years
 
01:25:08.590 --> 01:25:08.600 align:start position:0%
I'll just highlight again that it really
 
01:25:11.629 --> 01:25:11.639 align:start position:0%
is twofold so if um it is harder to
 
01:25:13.990 --> 01:25:14.000 align:start position:0%
bring staff on board it's more expensive
 
01:25:16.030 --> 01:25:16.040 align:start position:0%
and it's harder to bring staff on board
 
01:25:17.629 --> 01:25:17.639 align:start position:0%
and if they don't have the staff on
 
01:25:19.910 --> 01:25:19.920 align:start position:0%
board they can't generate the income
 
01:25:22.350 --> 01:25:22.360 align:start position:0%
through um Medicaid they can't get their
 
01:25:24.590 --> 01:25:24.600 align:start position:0%
their income generation so it's a one to
 
01:25:26.950 --> 01:25:26.960 align:start position:0%
punch if you can't have the staff there
 
01:25:28.790 --> 01:25:28.800 align:start position:0%
you can't have the billable hours that
 
01:25:31.990 --> 01:25:32.000 align:start position:0%
help with your um operational costs and
 
01:25:34.990 --> 01:25:35.000 align:start position:0%
so um the CM we have been working
 
01:25:37.950 --> 01:25:37.960 align:start position:0%
closely with the cmhc's after this $5
 
01:25:42.189 --> 01:25:42.199 align:start position:0%
million um uh gr uh $5 million contract
 
01:25:44.470 --> 01:25:44.480 align:start position:0%
from arpa money that was used to help
 
01:25:48.070 --> 01:25:48.080 align:start position:0%
support them um for almost all of them
 
01:25:49.669 --> 01:25:49.679 align:start position:0%
and we are working closely with them
 
01:25:51.550 --> 01:25:51.560 align:start position:0%
monitoring their financials on a on a
 
01:25:54.910 --> 01:25:54.920 align:start position:0%
quarterly basis representative Str
 
01:25:57.950 --> 01:25:57.960 align:start position:0%
so do you anticipate that they're
 
01:26:00.350 --> 01:26:00.360 align:start position:0%
covering operational losses from other
 
01:26:02.629 --> 01:26:02.639 align:start position:0%
donations from the community or is this
 
01:26:06.109 --> 01:26:06.119 align:start position:0%
a dying model without um a significant
 
01:26:08.030 --> 01:26:08.040 align:start position:0%
change in the way that uh the
 
01:26:10.270 --> 01:26:10.280 align:start position:0%
operational services are funded so part
 
01:26:11.990 --> 01:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
of what we ask them to do is to do that
 
01:26:13.790 --> 01:26:13.800 align:start position:0%
work amongst themselves to figure out
 
01:26:15.830 --> 01:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
what the what they need to do in order
 
01:26:17.510 --> 01:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
to sustain themselves with the current
 
01:26:18.870 --> 01:26:18.880 align:start position:0%
model and we're looking for those
 
01:26:20.669 --> 01:26:20.679 align:start position:0%
recommendations to come from them as
 
01:26:22.310 --> 01:26:22.320 align:start position:0%
well that's incumbent on them and their
 
01:26:25.910 --> 01:26:25.920 align:start position:0%
boards to figure out
 
01:26:28.990 --> 01:26:29.000 align:start position:0%
thank you all right great so Community
 
01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:30.669 align:start position:0%
thank you all right great so Community
Mental

01:26:30.669 --> 01:26:30.679 align:start position:0%
Mental
 
01:26:32.750 --> 01:26:32.760 align:start position:0%
Health did you have a question
 
01:26:34.830 --> 01:26:34.840 align:start position:0%
representative priest yes I do thank you
 
01:26:37.109 --> 01:26:37.119 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and thank you for taking my
 
01:26:39.830 --> 01:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
question could you give us some examples
 
01:26:43.390 --> 01:26:43.400 align:start position:0%
of what these Community Mental Health
 
01:26:46.590 --> 01:26:46.600 align:start position:0%
Facilities are not able to do now
 
01:26:50.149 --> 01:26:50.159 align:start position:0%
because of the lack of staff and the
 
01:26:53.709 --> 01:26:53.719 align:start position:0%
lack of the billable hours to get thank
 
01:26:54.750 --> 01:26:54.760 align:start position:0%
you for that question question so I
 
01:26:56.030 --> 01:26:56.040 align:start position:0%
think some of them are still trying to
 
01:26:58.270 --> 01:26:58.280 align:start position:0%
do everything they were doing before um
 
01:27:00.750 --> 01:27:00.760 align:start position:0%
because you know they have patients that
 
01:27:02.590 --> 01:27:02.600 align:start position:0%
need to be seen we have certainly had
 
01:27:04.030 --> 01:27:04.040 align:start position:0%
conversations with some of the Community
 
01:27:05.310 --> 01:27:05.320 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Centers as they think
 
01:27:06.830 --> 01:27:06.840 align:start position:0%
about whether or not they can take all
 
01:27:09.310 --> 01:27:09.320 align:start position:0%
comers it and whether or not we need to
 
01:27:11.310 --> 01:27:11.320 align:start position:0%
suspend that we have often put a
 
01:27:13.669 --> 01:27:13.679 align:start position:0%
suspension in hb2 language that they
 
01:27:15.350 --> 01:27:15.360 align:start position:0%
would not have they could have a waiting
 
01:27:16.870 --> 01:27:16.880 align:start position:0%
list if they needed to have a waiting
 
01:27:18.750 --> 01:27:18.760 align:start position:0%
list in order to manage
 
01:27:21.470 --> 01:27:21.480 align:start position:0%
that okay so they have a waiting list
 
01:27:25.350 --> 01:27:25.360 align:start position:0%
now or they some may some May
 
01:27:27.470 --> 01:27:27.480 align:start position:0%
okay and then the other piece that that
 
01:27:29.709 --> 01:27:29.719 align:start position:0%
is another component of this is is an
 
01:27:32.149 --> 01:27:32.159 align:start position:0%
overall model shift to something called
 
01:27:34.870 --> 01:27:34.880 align:start position:0%
our certified community behavioral
 
01:27:37.709 --> 01:27:37.719 align:start position:0%
health clinic and that's also a model
 
01:27:40.149 --> 01:27:40.159 align:start position:0%
that is taking a little bit of time to
 
01:27:42.750 --> 01:27:42.760 align:start position:0%
get started but it really looks at
 
01:27:45.510 --> 01:27:45.520 align:start position:0%
integration of both physical and mental
 
01:27:48.270 --> 01:27:48.280 align:start position:0%
health wellness and so we have been able
 
01:27:50.669 --> 01:27:50.679 align:start position:0%
so three of the um Community Health
 
01:27:52.550 --> 01:27:52.560 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Centers have had some
 
01:27:54.270 --> 01:27:54.280 align:start position:0%
additional Federal funding to again
 
01:27:56.189 --> 01:27:56.199 align:start position:0%
think about what the operational model
 
01:27:58.070 --> 01:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
with that would be and how sustainable
 
01:28:00.470 --> 01:28:00.480 align:start position:0%
it could be mooving as they sort of
 
01:28:03.510 --> 01:28:03.520 align:start position:0%
change their structure to meet the um
 
01:28:05.990 --> 01:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
declining need the declining resources
 
01:28:08.030 --> 01:28:08.040 align:start position:0%
that are available to them okay thank
 
01:28:11.790 --> 01:28:11.800 align:start position:0%
you great so at the heart so the
 
01:28:13.229 --> 01:28:13.239 align:start position:0%
Community Mental Health Center is
 
01:28:16.910 --> 01:28:16.920 align:start position:0%
incredibly important um part of our
 
01:28:19.790 --> 01:28:19.800 align:start position:0%
fabric of our safety net you we cannot
 
01:28:21.950 --> 01:28:21.960 align:start position:0%
function as a state in meeting the needs
 
01:28:24.550 --> 01:28:24.560 align:start position:0%
of people with significant Mental Health
 
01:28:26.669 --> 01:28:26.679 align:start position:0%
conditions without those Mental Health
 
01:28:28.470 --> 01:28:28.480 align:start position:0%
Centers and one of the ways that they do
 
01:28:30.430 --> 01:28:30.440 align:start position:0%
that is they play a critical role in
 
01:28:32.830 --> 01:28:32.840 align:start position:0%
Mission zero so if you look at slide 27
 
01:28:34.550 --> 01:28:34.560 align:start position:0%
you've heard us talk about this a lot it
 
01:28:37.870 --> 01:28:37.880 align:start position:0%
is one of the Marquee um components of
 
01:28:40.510 --> 01:28:40.520 align:start position:0%
our road map over the past couple years
 
01:28:43.390 --> 01:28:43.400 align:start position:0%
which is to reduce to zero very
 
01:28:45.950 --> 01:28:45.960 align:start position:0%
actionable the number of adults that are
 
01:28:48.070 --> 01:28:48.080 align:start position:0%
waiting in an emergency hospital
 
01:28:51.430 --> 01:28:51.440 align:start position:0%
emergency board room boarding waiting to
 
01:28:54.390 --> 01:28:54.400 align:start position:0%
get access to acute care to get that to
 
01:28:57.350 --> 01:28:57.360 align:start position:0%
zero I can report that we have met zero
 
01:29:00.030 --> 01:29:00.040 align:start position:0%
on individual days it is we have not yet
 
01:29:03.470 --> 01:29:03.480 align:start position:0%
been able to sustain ourselves at zero
 
01:29:07.350 --> 01:29:07.360 align:start position:0%
this is an incredibly complex issue and
 
01:29:09.669 --> 01:29:09.679 align:start position:0%
we have dedicated um we have worked
 
01:29:11.590 --> 01:29:11.600 align:start position:0%
closely with our Hospital partners and
 
01:29:14.270 --> 01:29:14.280 align:start position:0%
other Community Partners to address the
 
01:29:17.229 --> 01:29:17.239 align:start position:0%
three big drivers around emergency room
 
01:29:20.149 --> 01:29:20.159 align:start position:0%
boarding and that is what we Cally call
 
01:29:23.629 --> 01:29:23.639 align:start position:0%
the front door um coordination and the
 
01:29:26.550 --> 01:29:26.560 align:start position:0%
back door we need to get people in we
 
01:29:28.950 --> 01:29:28.960 align:start position:0%
need to coordinate that flow we need to
 
01:29:31.030 --> 01:29:31.040 align:start position:0%
be able to get people out of the
 
01:29:33.310 --> 01:29:33.320 align:start position:0%
hospital emergency department into an
 
01:29:35.950 --> 01:29:35.960 align:start position:0%
acute setting and then we also have to
 
01:29:38.629 --> 01:29:38.639 align:start position:0%
be able to transition them out of that
 
01:29:41.669 --> 01:29:41.679 align:start position:0%
hospital so other folks can get in and
 
01:29:44.870 --> 01:29:44.880 align:start position:0%
to do that um you know we have these
 
01:29:47.510 --> 01:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
sort of we've identified these six
 
01:29:49.270 --> 01:29:49.280 align:start position:0%
things that we're working on that we
 
01:29:52.270 --> 01:29:52.280 align:start position:0%
think are the real um levers that we can
 
01:29:55.310 --> 01:29:55.320 align:start position:0%
pull to get that front door open to get
 
01:29:57.229 --> 01:29:57.239 align:start position:0%
the right people in the right place and
 
01:29:59.070 --> 01:29:59.080 align:start position:0%
then to get the back door open which is
 
01:30:01.990 --> 01:30:02.000 align:start position:0%
to get folks back safely and what in
 
01:30:04.030 --> 01:30:04.040 align:start position:0%
their community in a way that that is
 
01:30:06.350 --> 01:30:06.360 align:start position:0%
sustainable and so that's looking at the
 
01:30:08.870 --> 01:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
expansion of community behavioral health
 
01:30:10.990 --> 01:30:11.000 align:start position:0%
clinics I just talked a new model of our
 
01:30:13.430 --> 01:30:13.440 align:start position:0%
community mental health centers um
 
01:30:15.430 --> 01:30:15.440 align:start position:0%
increasing opportunities for
 
01:30:17.790 --> 01:30:17.800 align:start position:0%
community-based crisis stabilization we
 
01:30:19.070 --> 01:30:19.080 align:start position:0%
just had the opportunity the
 
01:30:20.870 --> 01:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
commissioner and I and others going up
 
01:30:22.990 --> 01:30:23.000 align:start position:0%
to Plymouth to look at some of that work
 
01:30:26.550 --> 01:30:26.560 align:start position:0%
around having a place to go um just to
 
01:30:29.109 --> 01:30:29.119 align:start position:0%
get stabilized with peer support as well
 
01:30:31.669 --> 01:30:31.679 align:start position:0%
as clinical support when things are just
 
01:30:33.709 --> 01:30:33.719 align:start position:0%
feeling like they're escalating that's
 
01:30:36.390 --> 01:30:36.400 align:start position:0%
incredibly important to keep people from
 
01:30:38.470 --> 01:30:38.480 align:start position:0%
needing to go to the emergency
 
01:30:41.229 --> 01:30:41.239 align:start position:0%
department care traffic control which is
 
01:30:43.669 --> 01:30:43.679 align:start position:0%
that coordination which is centralizing
 
01:30:46.750 --> 01:30:46.760 align:start position:0%
with all the hospitals who has beds open
 
01:30:48.590 --> 01:30:48.600 align:start position:0%
when and where can we move you know who
 
01:30:50.590 --> 01:30:50.600 align:start position:0%
has people in emergency departments who
 
01:30:52.629 --> 01:30:52.639 align:start position:0%
have bed open beds open and can we get
 
01:30:54.590 --> 01:30:54.600 align:start position:0%
them all to the right place
 
01:30:57.270 --> 01:30:57.280 align:start position:0%
um the expansion in the number we call
 
01:31:01.030 --> 01:31:01.040 align:start position:0%
them drf designated receiving beds um
 
01:31:02.430 --> 01:31:02.440 align:start position:0%
you make sure that we have beds
 
01:31:05.550 --> 01:31:05.560 align:start position:0%
available expansions in step down and
 
01:31:07.629 --> 01:31:07.639 align:start position:0%
into less restrictive settings again
 
01:31:09.709 --> 01:31:09.719 align:start position:0%
getting folks out the back door and then
 
01:31:11.910 --> 01:31:11.920 align:start position:0%
all the way to landlord incentives so
 
01:31:14.709 --> 01:31:14.719 align:start position:0%
that we have housing that's stable and
 
01:31:17.350 --> 01:31:17.360 align:start position:0%
we can support landlords so that they
 
01:31:20.790 --> 01:31:20.800 align:start position:0%
feel comfortable in renting to this
 
01:31:23.750 --> 01:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
particular population so if we move to
 
01:31:26.590 --> 01:31:26.600 align:start position:0%
um so so two things there yes I for for
 
01:31:30.229 --> 01:31:30.239 align:start position:0%
the newer people uh we're responding to
 
01:31:32.669 --> 01:31:32.679 align:start position:0%
um a court case a court order correct
 
01:31:34.390 --> 01:31:34.400 align:start position:0%
right so this isn't just because it's
 
01:31:36.109 --> 01:31:36.119 align:start position:0%
the right thing to do it's also because
 
01:31:38.030 --> 01:31:38.040 align:start position:0%
we have we have to do it we we have a
 
01:31:41.070 --> 01:31:41.080 align:start position:0%
legal obligation to do this and then
 
01:31:43.070 --> 01:31:43.080 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding correct me if I'm
 
01:31:46.470 --> 01:31:46.480 align:start position:0%
wrong that if we I I I I hear the whole
 
01:31:48.550 --> 01:31:48.560 align:start position:0%
systems Pipeline and all the things
 
01:31:51.109 --> 01:31:51.119 align:start position:0%
you're doing to to improve the pipeline
 
01:31:53.430 --> 01:31:53.440 align:start position:0%
throughout perfect thinking but if we
 
01:31:56.149 --> 01:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
could only do one thing is it true that
 
01:31:58.870 --> 01:31:58.880 align:start position:0%
the number one thing we have to do is
 
01:32:00.990 --> 01:32:01.000 align:start position:0%
clear out the New Hampshire hospital be
 
01:32:02.910 --> 01:32:02.920 align:start position:0%
able to handle discharges more
 
01:32:05.550 --> 01:32:05.560 align:start position:0%
effectively uh and and that means we
 
01:32:07.350 --> 01:32:07.360 align:start position:0%
have to have places for those people to
 
01:32:09.950 --> 01:32:09.960 align:start position:0%
go is that really the heart of the
 
01:32:11.830 --> 01:32:11.840 align:start position:0%
biggest part of the problem that is one
 
01:32:13.109 --> 01:32:13.119 align:start position:0%
of them I don't know that I I'm
 
01:32:14.990 --> 01:32:15.000 align:start position:0%
comfortable saying that's it but it's
 
01:32:16.790 --> 01:32:16.800 align:start position:0%
critically important and that's the work
 
01:32:18.470 --> 01:32:18.480 align:start position:0%
that we're really focused on we're
 
01:32:20.470 --> 01:32:20.480 align:start position:0%
focused on all of it the care traffic
 
01:32:22.350 --> 01:32:22.360 align:start position:0%
control was incredibly important to be
 
01:32:24.910 --> 01:32:24.920 align:start position:0%
able to match resources that I I don't
 
01:32:27.030 --> 01:32:27.040 align:start position:0%
want to understate that and it's a real
 
01:32:28.790 --> 01:32:28.800 align:start position:0%
systems if you want to go back and like
 
01:32:31.910 --> 01:32:31.920 align:start position:0%
lean it or what or denting it um that
 
01:32:34.430 --> 01:32:34.440 align:start position:0%
was really important but ultimately
 
01:32:36.709 --> 01:32:36.719 align:start position:0%
there has to be a place that's safe for
 
01:32:38.990 --> 01:32:39.000 align:start position:0%
people to go when they leave the
 
01:32:40.910 --> 01:32:40.920 align:start position:0%
hospital and so that they can leave the
 
01:32:43.149 --> 01:32:43.159 align:start position:0%
hospital right I I I'm not minimizing
 
01:32:45.870 --> 01:32:45.880 align:start position:0%
all the great work to to do to see have
 
01:32:48.350 --> 01:32:48.360 align:start position:0%
the visibility over the workflow I that
 
01:32:50.590 --> 01:32:50.600 align:start position:0%
was beautiful that was good that's great
 
01:32:52.390 --> 01:32:52.400 align:start position:0%
I'm just thinking that the next big
 
01:32:54.950 --> 01:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
thing that we do that may have the
 
01:32:58.189 --> 01:32:58.199 align:start position:0%
biggest budgetary impact is clearing out
 
01:32:59.910 --> 01:32:59.920 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire hospital and having
 
01:33:02.070 --> 01:33:02.080 align:start position:0%
places to go it's it's the having the
 
01:33:03.830 --> 01:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
place to go I'm worried about the money
 
01:33:06.109 --> 01:33:06.119 align:start position:0%
too I mean obviously the workflow is
 
01:33:08.910 --> 01:33:08.920 align:start position:0%
important but you know we need you to
 
01:33:12.750 --> 01:33:12.760 align:start position:0%
help us understand uh where the the the
 
01:33:16.590 --> 01:33:16.600 align:start position:0%
biggest cash issue is and and what is
 
01:33:18.390 --> 01:33:18.400 align:start position:0%
what we're going to do so if you look at
 
01:33:20.910 --> 01:33:20.920 align:start position:0%
the the next slide afterwards I I don't
 
01:33:23.070 --> 01:33:23.080 align:start position:0%
I've lost my numbers on the slide but um
 
01:33:25.350 --> 01:33:25.360 align:start position:0%
really that's says MZ strategy
 
01:33:27.750 --> 01:33:27.760 align:start position:0%
description funding this is an example
 
01:33:30.590 --> 01:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
of again those items that we need to do
 
01:33:33.070 --> 01:33:33.080 align:start position:0%
and it this is how we've had to leverage
 
01:33:35.189 --> 01:33:35.199 align:start position:0%
all those different sources of funds so
 
01:33:37.149 --> 01:33:37.159 align:start position:0%
for example the landlord incentives have
 
01:33:39.390 --> 01:33:39.400 align:start position:0%
been really helpful it's relatively
 
01:33:42.669 --> 01:33:42.679 align:start position:0%
small numbers um but it's the way that
 
01:33:44.709 --> 01:33:44.719 align:start position:0%
you get people into sta into stable
 
01:33:47.030 --> 01:33:47.040 align:start position:0%
housing that you're not and in a less
 
01:33:49.629 --> 01:33:49.639 align:start position:0%
restrictive stable housing is to be able
 
01:33:51.950 --> 01:33:51.960 align:start position:0%
to make sure that landlords know that
 
01:33:53.910 --> 01:33:53.920 align:start position:0%
they have someone to call that they have
 
01:33:56.229 --> 01:33:56.239 align:start position:0%
a little bit of skin in the game as well
 
01:33:58.030 --> 01:33:58.040 align:start position:0%
to making sure that we've got great
 
01:34:00.510 --> 01:34:00.520 align:start position:0%
housing available or appropriate housing
 
01:34:02.510 --> 01:34:02.520 align:start position:0%
available for people to ultimately live
 
01:34:04.910 --> 01:34:04.920 align:start position:0%
in so that they can Thrive and stay in
 
01:34:07.350 --> 01:34:07.360 align:start position:0%
the community rather than needing
 
01:34:11.270 --> 01:34:11.280 align:start position:0%
expensive um uh acute care and more
 
01:34:12.990 --> 01:34:13.000 align:start position:0%
importantly that they don't have a need
 
01:34:14.990 --> 01:34:15.000 align:start position:0%
for that level of acute care I I think
 
01:34:17.390 --> 01:34:17.400 align:start position:0%
represent wner did you have a question
 
01:34:19.750 --> 01:34:19.760 align:start position:0%
yes I did I did have a question so I
 
01:34:22.470 --> 01:34:22.480 align:start position:0%
can't keep my eyes off this one and I
 
01:34:25.109 --> 01:34:25.119 align:start position:0%
this goes back a couple of pages so this
 
01:34:27.990 --> 01:34:28.000 align:start position:0%
one slide of eight out of T eight out of
 
01:34:30.390 --> 01:34:30.400 align:start position:0%
the 10 Mental Health Centers they seem
 
01:34:34.390 --> 01:34:34.400 align:start position:0%
so important to all the work of keeping
 
01:34:36.629 --> 01:34:36.639 align:start position:0%
people in the community and not into
 
01:34:40.109 --> 01:34:40.119 align:start position:0%
higher end care and I'm wondering how
 
01:34:40.119 --> 01:34:41.229 align:start position:0%
higher end care and I'm wondering how
severe

01:34:41.229 --> 01:34:41.239 align:start position:0%
severe
 
01:34:45.350 --> 01:34:45.360 align:start position:0%
are these losses are any of these mental
 
01:34:47.910 --> 01:34:47.920 align:start position:0%
health centers in a situation where we
 
01:34:50.709 --> 01:34:50.719 align:start position:0%
would lose them so I don't think we're I
 
01:34:52.510 --> 01:34:52.520 align:start position:0%
it is not my understanding that we're in
 
01:34:54.629 --> 01:34:54.639 align:start position:0%
a place right now where we're in Dire
 
01:34:57.189 --> 01:34:57.199 align:start position:0%
Straits but the can there is a canary in
 
01:34:58.669 --> 01:34:58.679 align:start position:0%
the coal mine saying you know we're
 
01:35:00.669 --> 01:35:00.679 align:start position:0%
seeing red we're seeing brackets and
 
01:35:02.229 --> 01:35:02.239 align:start position:0%
we're seeing red in spreadsheets and
 
01:35:04.149 --> 01:35:04.159 align:start position:0%
that's always concerning and these are
 
01:35:06.430 --> 01:35:06.440 align:start position:0%
you know organizations that have
 
01:35:08.550 --> 01:35:08.560 align:start position:0%
thoughtful boards that understand how
 
01:35:11.709 --> 01:35:11.719 align:start position:0%
they work so that's concerning to us um
 
01:35:14.510 --> 01:35:14.520 align:start position:0%
we don't want to see them slide anymore
 
01:35:17.070 --> 01:35:17.080 align:start position:0%
into larger and larger deficits there's
 
01:35:18.790 --> 01:35:18.800 align:start position:0%
an you know and it's eight we have two
 
01:35:21.550 --> 01:35:21.560 align:start position:0%
that are not in operational losses um
 
01:35:24.470 --> 01:35:24.480 align:start position:0%
one of the you know we only gave that $5
 
01:35:27.270 --> 01:35:27.280 align:start position:0%
million or split that $5 million among
 
01:35:30.229 --> 01:35:30.239 align:start position:0%
nine of them so we're working with them
 
01:35:34.669 --> 01:35:34.679 align:start position:0%
to monitor those um those financials uh
 
01:35:36.590 --> 01:35:36.600 align:start position:0%
and we also are working with them to
 
01:35:38.310 --> 01:35:38.320 align:start position:0%
make sure that they're doing their own
 
01:35:40.350 --> 01:35:40.360 align:start position:0%
work to figure out how to have a model
 
01:35:41.790 --> 01:35:41.800 align:start position:0%
that's sustainable so I don't want to
 
01:35:43.189 --> 01:35:43.199 align:start position:0%
ring a bell and say that someone's
 
01:35:45.590 --> 01:35:45.600 align:start position:0%
closing tomorrow I don't want to suggest
 
01:35:47.550 --> 01:35:47.560 align:start position:0%
that but it's enough that we should be
 
01:35:47.560 --> 01:35:48.950 align:start position:0%
that but it's enough that we should be
paying

01:35:48.950 --> 01:35:48.960 align:start position:0%
paying
 
01:35:53.830 --> 01:35:53.840 align:start position:0%
attention thank you yep thank you
 
01:35:55.870 --> 01:35:55.880 align:start position:0%
so uh how do we know Mission zero is
 
01:35:57.669 --> 01:35:57.679 align:start position:0%
working this is a great example we're
 
01:35:59.870 --> 01:35:59.880 align:start position:0%
often asked how are we accountable we're
 
01:36:02.270 --> 01:36:02.280 align:start position:0%
Ma we're watching the data we have great
 
01:36:05.109 --> 01:36:05.119 align:start position:0%
um online tools that all of you can also
 
01:36:06.709 --> 01:36:06.719 align:start position:0%
look at when you look at this slide that
 
01:36:08.910 --> 01:36:08.920 align:start position:0%
has this great line we have gone from
 
01:36:12.669 --> 01:36:12.679 align:start position:0%
what was um back in 2023 an average of
 
01:36:16.629 --> 01:36:16.639 align:start position:0%
44 individuals waiting in um hospital
 
01:36:19.590 --> 01:36:19.600 align:start position:0%
emergency rooms down to I would say
 
01:36:21.470 --> 01:36:21.480 align:start position:0%
suggest that it's less than 20 this is a
 
01:36:23.790 --> 01:36:23.800 align:start position:0%
little bit old but an average of less
 
01:36:26.070 --> 01:36:26.080 align:start position:0%
than 20 knowing that we get to we have
 
01:36:28.430 --> 01:36:28.440 align:start position:0%
gotten to zero on individual days
 
01:36:29.790 --> 01:36:29.800 align:start position:0%
sometimes those numbers bounce up and
 
01:36:31.350 --> 01:36:31.360 align:start position:0%
down it's the reason we flatten it out
 
01:36:34.750 --> 01:36:34.760 align:start position:0%
with that red line um we have seen that
 
01:36:38.470 --> 01:36:38.480 align:start position:0%
small uptick in um designated receiving
 
01:36:41.470 --> 01:36:41.480 align:start position:0%
facility beds drf beds we've seen that
 
01:36:43.590 --> 01:36:43.600 align:start position:0%
move up we've seen that within our own
 
01:36:46.550 --> 01:36:46.560 align:start position:0%
hospital um Ellen Leo who's the CEO of
 
01:36:47.750 --> 01:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire hospital has done
 
01:36:49.910 --> 01:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
extraordinary work um in making sure
 
01:36:51.550 --> 01:36:51.560 align:start position:0%
that we have as many beds online as
 
01:36:53.270 --> 01:36:53.280 align:start position:0%
possible at New Hampshire hospital but
 
01:36:55.470 --> 01:36:55.480 align:start position:0%
this is also with our other partners
 
01:36:57.030 --> 01:36:57.040 align:start position:0%
other hospitals in the state that also
 
01:36:59.070 --> 01:36:59.080 align:start position:0%
have their own beds so we're seeing that
 
01:37:01.550 --> 01:37:01.560 align:start position:0%
while it's not a dramatic slope every
 
01:37:03.030 --> 01:37:03.040 align:start position:0%
bed is important when you're looking at
 
01:37:06.270 --> 01:37:06.280 align:start position:0%
20 people waiting that's a small end so
 
01:37:08.430 --> 01:37:08.440 align:start position:0%
each bed matters in there and with just
 
01:37:10.590 --> 01:37:10.600 align:start position:0%
even the inclusion of a few more we
 
01:37:12.629 --> 01:37:12.639 align:start position:0%
continue to get that number of
 
01:37:14.390 --> 01:37:14.400 align:start position:0%
individuals waiting in the emergency
 
01:37:17.590 --> 01:37:17.600 align:start position:0%
room to decrease importantly I love the
 
01:37:19.750 --> 01:37:19.760 align:start position:0%
green bar graph as well because it shows
 
01:37:23.149 --> 01:37:23.159 align:start position:0%
how you know just even in um febru from
 
01:37:26.350 --> 01:37:26.360 align:start position:0%
February AR to December in 2024 we went
 
01:37:28.550 --> 01:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
from a weight of an average of about 4
 
01:37:30.990 --> 01:37:31.000 align:start position:0%
days down to a wait to about a day and a
 
01:37:33.470 --> 01:37:33.480 align:start position:0%
half that's incredible progress to me as
 
01:37:36.229 --> 01:37:36.239 align:start position:0%
well so while the inflow continues we're
 
01:37:38.070 --> 01:37:38.080 align:start position:0%
seeing the num the amount of time
 
01:37:41.229 --> 01:37:41.239 align:start position:0%
waiting decrease incredibly important it
 
01:37:43.950 --> 01:37:43.960 align:start position:0%
this an emergency room is no place to be
 
01:37:45.430 --> 01:37:45.440 align:start position:0%
when you're in a mental health crisis
 
01:37:47.550 --> 01:37:47.560 align:start position:0%
whether you're an adult or a child and
 
01:37:48.470 --> 01:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure that they're
 
01:37:49.950 --> 01:37:49.960 align:start position:0%
getting into the appropriate level of
 
01:37:52.589 --> 01:37:52.599 align:start position:0%
care so I'm I'm on my last two slot I
 
01:37:54.310 --> 01:37:54.320 align:start position:0%
want to say something for we have
 
01:37:55.669 --> 01:37:55.679 align:start position:0%
members of the committee that I don't
 
01:37:57.870 --> 01:37:57.880 align:start position:0%
know have ever spent much time uh
 
01:38:00.149 --> 01:38:00.159 align:start position:0%
walking around in an emergency room and
 
01:38:01.950 --> 01:38:01.960 align:start position:0%
and seeing what the operation of an
 
01:38:05.070 --> 01:38:05.080 align:start position:0%
emergency room is like but but having
 
01:38:07.870 --> 01:38:07.880 align:start position:0%
people uh in a weight category for
 
01:38:10.070 --> 01:38:10.080 align:start position:0%
mental health in the corridor of an
 
01:38:12.990 --> 01:38:13.000 align:start position:0%
emergency room this this is barbaric
 
01:38:14.550 --> 01:38:14.560 align:start position:0%
this is the kind of thing that happens
 
01:38:17.790 --> 01:38:17.800 align:start position:0%
in third world Nations and so so I think
 
01:38:20.709 --> 01:38:20.719 align:start position:0%
not only the court order but good care
 
01:38:22.990 --> 01:38:23.000 align:start position:0%
and just making sure our ERS are
 
01:38:26.109 --> 01:38:26.119 align:start position:0%
functional to handle emergency triage
 
01:38:29.510 --> 01:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
situations and all the like I I I I
 
01:38:32.189 --> 01:38:32.199 align:start position:0%
think that uh I really appreciate the
 
01:38:34.030 --> 01:38:34.040 align:start position:0%
way the commissioner and the everyone's
 
01:38:36.830 --> 01:38:36.840 align:start position:0%
been addressing this uh and I I just
 
01:38:38.589 --> 01:38:38.599 align:start position:0%
want you to know I I think we need to
 
01:38:42.470 --> 01:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
continue to support your efforts because
 
01:38:45.709 --> 01:38:45.719 align:start position:0%
this needs to be routinely zero I think
 
01:38:47.669 --> 01:38:47.679 align:start position:0%
yes absolutely it is it is what we're
 
01:38:50.629 --> 01:38:50.639 align:start position:0%
all focused laser focused on and and I
 
01:38:53.510 --> 01:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
don't want to um you I don't want want
 
01:38:55.750 --> 01:38:55.760 align:start position:0%
to minimize I would I want to overstate
 
01:38:58.470 --> 01:38:58.480 align:start position:0%
and underscore the role of our partners
 
01:39:00.270 --> 01:39:00.280 align:start position:0%
in getting here both at the community
 
01:39:02.149 --> 01:39:02.159 align:start position:0%
mental health centers in the hospitals
 
01:39:04.550 --> 01:39:04.560 align:start position:0%
around the state Nami New Hampshire
 
01:39:06.910 --> 01:39:06.920 align:start position:0%
everyone coming together around the
 
01:39:08.709 --> 01:39:08.719 align:start position:0%
table and sort of airing our Dirty
 
01:39:10.910 --> 01:39:10.920 align:start position:0%
Laundry together and working through
 
01:39:14.229 --> 01:39:14.239 align:start position:0%
really tricky problems is what's enabled
 
01:39:15.910 --> 01:39:15.920 align:start position:0%
us to make this progress and while it
 
01:39:18.750 --> 01:39:18.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't may not look radical from 4 days
 
01:39:20.950 --> 01:39:20.960 align:start position:0%
to a day and a half is critically
 
01:39:22.669 --> 01:39:22.679 align:start position:0%
important if you're a person in need as
 
01:39:24.270 --> 01:39:24.280 align:start position:0%
representative at words describ so where
 
01:39:26.709 --> 01:39:26.719 align:start position:0%
I'm met on my last two slides so how do
 
01:39:28.750 --> 01:39:28.760 align:start position:0%
we know all of this is working we have
 
01:39:31.229 --> 01:39:31.239 align:start position:0%
our road map we're meeting our metrics
 
01:39:32.870 --> 01:39:32.880 align:start position:0%
um you'll see the little check marks
 
01:39:34.510 --> 01:39:34.520 align:start position:0%
we've had deliverables within our road
 
01:39:36.790 --> 01:39:36.800 align:start position:0%
map that we've been able to get to um
 
01:39:38.750 --> 01:39:38.760 align:start position:0%
we're thrilled around the community
 
01:39:41.270 --> 01:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
behav the um we're we've got two
 
01:39:44.350 --> 01:39:44.360 align:start position:0%
certified in our ccbhcs so we're almost
 
01:39:47.350 --> 01:39:47.360 align:start position:0%
at that um and then finally around our
 
01:39:49.750 --> 01:39:49.760 align:start position:0%
crisis stabilization locations again a
 
01:39:53.510 --> 01:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
place to go to deescalate to talk to
 
01:39:56.750 --> 01:39:56.760 align:start position:0%
here to get some professional help um so
 
01:39:59.229 --> 01:39:59.239 align:start position:0%
that you can reduce just one more person
 
01:40:01.030 --> 01:40:01.040 align:start position:0%
from having to go to the emergency room
 
01:40:03.310 --> 01:40:03.320 align:start position:0%
and experience that kind of care that's
 
01:40:05.470 --> 01:40:05.480 align:start position:0%
what it's all about we've got um we only
 
01:40:07.589 --> 01:40:07.599 align:start position:0%
have we were hoping to have total of
 
01:40:10.510 --> 01:40:10.520 align:start position:0%
four we only had enough funding for two
 
01:40:12.709 --> 01:40:12.719 align:start position:0%
um and then finally around building this
 
01:40:15.510 --> 01:40:15.520 align:start position:0%
right siiz Statewide system of inpatient
 
01:40:18.350 --> 01:40:18.360 align:start position:0%
care and getting our transfers going we
 
01:40:20.350 --> 01:40:20.360 align:start position:0%
have launched our our dashboard which is
 
01:40:22.350 --> 01:40:22.360 align:start position:0%
where you saw that data we have
 
01:40:24.350 --> 01:40:24.360 align:start position:0%
increased the number number of beds at
 
01:40:26.270 --> 01:40:26.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire hospital and I can tell
 
01:40:28.470 --> 01:40:28.480 align:start position:0%
you that in February just about a week
 
01:40:30.510 --> 01:40:30.520 align:start position:0%
or so Dartmouth health is going to bring
 
01:40:32.669 --> 01:40:32.679 align:start position:0%
five more beds online incredibly
 
01:40:34.669 --> 01:40:34.679 align:start position:0%
important and with
 
01:40:38.510 --> 01:40:38.520 align:start position:0%
that a question about the 185 it's
 
01:40:40.950 --> 01:40:40.960 align:start position:0%
capacity is that is that staff
 
01:40:44.510 --> 01:40:44.520 align:start position:0%
capability or is that potential capacity
 
01:40:53.830 --> 01:40:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:55.390 --> 01:40:55.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question Ellen Le
 
01:40:56.910 --> 01:40:56.920 align:start position:0%
Point I'm the CEO at New Hampshire
 
01:40:58.990 --> 01:40:59.000 align:start position:0%
hospital so you're asking about the
 
01:41:02.390 --> 01:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
number of 185 and if it's dependent on
 
01:41:04.750 --> 01:41:04.760 align:start position:0%
Staffing and if we can go above that so
 
01:41:08.669 --> 01:41:08.679 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question so 185 is um
 
01:41:11.189 --> 01:41:11.199 align:start position:0%
our capacity there are occasions where
 
01:41:13.470 --> 01:41:13.480 align:start position:0%
we've been able to go above that or of
 
01:41:15.589 --> 01:41:15.599 align:start position:0%
course below that as it relates
 
01:41:19.350 --> 01:41:19.360 align:start position:0%
primarily to Acuity on units as well as
 
01:41:21.950 --> 01:41:21.960 align:start position:0%
semi-private rooms versus private rooms
 
01:41:23.950 --> 01:41:23.960 align:start position:0%
the majority of our rooms the hospital
 
01:41:26.149 --> 01:41:26.159 align:start position:0%
are semi-private but as you can imagine
 
01:41:27.750 --> 01:41:27.760 align:start position:0%
there are circumstances where certain
 
01:41:30.030 --> 01:41:30.040 align:start position:0%
patients require private rooms so that
 
01:41:31.669 --> 01:41:31.679 align:start position:0%
does sometimes have an impact on our
 
01:41:34.550 --> 01:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
overall census okay so my question was
 
01:41:37.950 --> 01:41:37.960 align:start position:0%
much simpler than than your answer uh I
 
01:41:39.830 --> 01:41:39.840 align:start position:0%
I just want to make sure how we're using
 
01:41:43.390 --> 01:41:43.400 align:start position:0%
the word capacity is this a physical
 
01:41:45.790 --> 01:41:45.800 align:start position:0%
capacity or a staffed
 
01:41:49.709 --> 01:41:49.719 align:start position:0%
bed physical capacity physical so so
 
01:41:51.589 --> 01:41:51.599 align:start position:0%
it's probably a lesser number because
 
01:41:54.629 --> 01:41:54.639 align:start position:0%
you're still de still dealing with
 
01:41:54.639 --> 01:41:56.030 align:start position:0%
you're still de still dealing with
Workforce

01:41:56.030 --> 01:41:56.040 align:start position:0%
Workforce
 
01:41:59.430 --> 01:41:59.440 align:start position:0%
issues I mean because because the next
 
01:42:01.709 --> 01:42:01.719 align:start position:0%
question you can anticipate is how are
 
01:42:03.830 --> 01:42:03.840 align:start position:0%
you doing on Workforce we're doing
 
01:42:06.870 --> 01:42:06.880 align:start position:0%
better on Workforce our uh retention
 
01:42:09.030 --> 01:42:09.040 align:start position:0%
rates are very high in comparison to
 
01:42:13.310 --> 01:42:13.320 align:start position:0%
National averages but also our um our
 
01:42:16.149 --> 01:42:16.159 align:start position:0%
current uh I can't think of the word
 
01:42:18.510 --> 01:42:18.520 align:start position:0%
vacancy thank you vacancy rate um is a
 
01:42:20.910 --> 01:42:20.920 align:start position:0%
bit higher than the department um in
 
01:42:22.950 --> 01:42:22.960 align:start position:0%
general but overall we have been able to
 
01:42:24.950 --> 01:42:24.960 align:start position:0%
make some progress on hiring some
 
01:42:27.070 --> 01:42:27.080 align:start position:0%
additional clinical staff and of course
 
01:42:30.430 --> 01:42:30.440 align:start position:0%
we are using uh contracted staff as well
 
01:42:33.589 --> 01:42:33.599 align:start position:0%
so so we're today approximately where do
 
01:42:36.390 --> 01:42:36.400 align:start position:0%
you think you are on staffed
 
01:42:40.550 --> 01:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
beds 185 oh all right so I'm I'm having
 
01:42:41.990 --> 01:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
trouble with the word capacity
 
01:42:44.870 --> 01:42:44.880 align:start position:0%
apparently uh representative Daniels
 
01:42:47.990 --> 01:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
thank you why do we have such a mental
 
01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:51.310 align:start position:0%
thank you why do we have such a mental
health

01:42:51.310 --> 01:42:51.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:54.070 --> 01:42:54.080 align:start position:0%
crisis um boy wish I could answer that
 
01:42:55.990 --> 01:42:56.000 align:start position:0%
question for you and and certainly not
 
01:42:58.149 --> 01:42:58.159 align:start position:0%
in the 15 minutes that's left for me
 
01:43:00.750 --> 01:43:00.760 align:start position:0%
today you know I think it is
 
01:43:04.750 --> 01:43:04.760 align:start position:0%
so um multi there are so many reasons
 
01:43:06.750 --> 01:43:06.760 align:start position:0%
multifactoral um some of it is
 
01:43:08.589 --> 01:43:08.599 align:start position:0%
recognizing mental health conditions in
 
01:43:10.350 --> 01:43:10.360 align:start position:0%
the way that we may not have me
 
01:43:13.629 --> 01:43:13.639 align:start position:0%
recognized that in the past I think we
 
01:43:15.629 --> 01:43:15.639 align:start position:0%
fundamentally as a society we want to
 
01:43:16.910 --> 01:43:16.920 align:start position:0%
make sure that people have strong
 
01:43:18.589 --> 01:43:18.599 align:start position:0%
Connections in their Community we know
 
01:43:19.950 --> 01:43:19.960 align:start position:0%
that connections are incredibly
 
01:43:23.109 --> 01:43:23.119 align:start position:0%
important um and I think the ability
 
01:43:25.510 --> 01:43:25.520 align:start position:0%
ability to name and treat those
 
01:43:26.629 --> 01:43:26.639 align:start position:0%
conditions so that people can have
 
01:43:29.669 --> 01:43:29.679 align:start position:0%
healthy lives is is incredibly important
 
01:43:31.270 --> 01:43:31.280 align:start position:0%
and to be able to get the kind of care
 
01:43:34.750 --> 01:43:34.760 align:start position:0%
that's needed I I wish I could fully um
 
01:43:36.910 --> 01:43:36.920 align:start position:0%
explain that there's a great couple of
 
01:43:39.589 --> 01:43:39.599 align:start position:0%
um uh the surgeon the previous Surgeon
 
01:43:41.430 --> 01:43:41.440 align:start position:0%
General under um the previous
 
01:43:43.950 --> 01:43:43.960 align:start position:0%
administration did some great um pieces
 
01:43:45.950 --> 01:43:45.960 align:start position:0%
on things like loneliness and other
 
01:43:48.510 --> 01:43:48.520 align:start position:0%
contributors to mental health conditions
 
01:43:50.510 --> 01:43:50.520 align:start position:0%
but man I I can't answer that question
 
01:43:52.070 --> 01:43:52.080 align:start position:0%
for you in full in a way that's
 
01:43:56.589 --> 01:43:56.599 align:start position:0%
appropriate thank you um I I I waited
 
01:43:58.550 --> 01:43:58.560 align:start position:0%
purposely until you got done to see if
 
01:44:02.390 --> 01:44:02.400 align:start position:0%
you would basically answer the question
 
01:44:05.589 --> 01:44:05.599 align:start position:0%
um regard regarding
 
01:44:07.750 --> 01:44:07.760 align:start position:0%
preventive measures that the department
 
01:44:11.750 --> 01:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
has taken you mentioned it a little bit
 
01:44:14.350 --> 01:44:14.360 align:start position:0%
but you also mentioned that the numbers
 
01:44:16.510 --> 01:44:16.520 align:start position:0%
are going up particularly when you're
 
01:44:18.790 --> 01:44:18.800 align:start position:0%
talking about the the four out of 10
 
01:44:23.629 --> 01:44:23.639 align:start position:0%
students who felt sad or depressed um it
 
01:44:28.229 --> 01:44:28.239 align:start position:0%
seems to me that maybe a major focus
 
01:44:31.070 --> 01:44:31.080 align:start position:0%
should be more on prevention and not
 
01:44:32.750 --> 01:44:32.760 align:start position:0%
getting people into the system because
 
01:44:34.629 --> 01:44:34.639 align:start position:0%
it seems like the majority of what
 
01:44:38.550 --> 01:44:38.560 align:start position:0%
you're doing I is trying to Pro provide
 
01:44:41.790 --> 01:44:41.800 align:start position:0%
treatment as opposed to preventative
 
01:44:44.510 --> 01:44:44.520 align:start position:0%
measur that would ever keep them from
 
01:44:47.350 --> 01:44:47.360 align:start position:0%
from getting getting there so um can you
 
01:44:49.589 --> 01:44:49.599 align:start position:0%
talk sure I can talk a little bit about
 
01:44:51.830 --> 01:44:51.840 align:start position:0%
that you are speaking some of you know
 
01:44:53.750 --> 01:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
where I am grounded in my own personal
 
01:44:55.270 --> 01:44:55.280 align:start position:0%
work that I have done over time so I'm
 
01:44:57.750 --> 01:44:57.760 align:start position:0%
really thankful to hear that question
 
01:45:00.550 --> 01:45:00.560 align:start position:0%
and um and and have the opportunity to
 
01:45:02.189 --> 01:45:02.199 align:start position:0%
explore that a little more as we do our
 
01:45:04.270 --> 01:45:04.280 align:start position:0%
work not just today so you're absolutely
 
01:45:05.709 --> 01:45:05.719 align:start position:0%
right part of why I haven't talked a lot
 
01:45:07.990 --> 01:45:08.000 align:start position:0%
about prevention is today's Focus was
 
01:45:09.669 --> 01:45:09.679 align:start position:0%
really on these areas in children youth
 
01:45:11.629 --> 01:45:11.639 align:start position:0%
and families and Behavioral Health much
 
01:45:13.270 --> 01:45:13.280 align:start position:0%
of that prevention work happens out in
 
01:45:15.350 --> 01:45:15.360 align:start position:0%
the community and happens in places like
 
01:45:17.629 --> 01:45:17.639 align:start position:0%
in public health settings or the Ed or
 
01:45:19.910 --> 01:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
school and not that schools are doing
 
01:45:21.790 --> 01:45:21.800 align:start position:0%
social emotional Wellness or you know
 
01:45:24.030 --> 01:45:24.040 align:start position:0%
things that are scary but how are we
 
01:45:27.030 --> 01:45:27.040 align:start position:0%
making sure that kids are um in settings
 
01:45:28.830 --> 01:45:28.840 align:start position:0%
that are kind you know that children
 
01:45:30.669 --> 01:45:30.679 align:start position:0%
learn how to be kind to each other all
 
01:45:32.629 --> 01:45:32.639 align:start position:0%
of that is important early on and we
 
01:45:34.030 --> 01:45:34.040 align:start position:0%
need to have strengthened families
 
01:45:36.310 --> 01:45:36.320 align:start position:0%
families that have the resources they
 
01:45:38.030 --> 01:45:38.040 align:start position:0%
need to to get by in the day that
 
01:45:40.470 --> 01:45:40.480 align:start position:0%
they've got food and housing and they're
 
01:45:42.750 --> 01:45:42.760 align:start position:0%
not as stressed out mom you know Mom and
 
01:45:44.229 --> 01:45:44.239 align:start position:0%
Dad are both working that we have
 
01:45:46.229 --> 01:45:46.239 align:start position:0%
appropriate child care all of those are
 
01:45:48.470 --> 01:45:48.480 align:start position:0%
contributors and are part of the
 
01:45:51.070 --> 01:45:51.080 align:start position:0%
prevention ecosystem that we need to
 
01:45:53.709 --> 01:45:53.719 align:start position:0%
make sure that families are
 
01:45:56.390 --> 01:45:56.400 align:start position:0%
and getting the um supports they need
 
01:45:59.390 --> 01:45:59.400 align:start position:0%
within their communities and none of us
 
01:46:02.350 --> 01:46:02.360 align:start position:0%
want uh our never none of us really want
 
01:46:04.350 --> 01:46:04.360 align:start position:0%
to have people in in these systems you
 
01:46:05.589 --> 01:46:05.599 align:start position:0%
know there will always be a need for
 
01:46:07.470 --> 01:46:07.480 align:start position:0%
them I want to say there are conditions
 
01:46:09.109 --> 01:46:09.119 align:start position:0%
in life that we are not going to be able
 
01:46:11.310 --> 01:46:11.320 align:start position:0%
to get around but we want to be able to
 
01:46:13.629 --> 01:46:13.639 align:start position:0%
be starting early in especially with
 
01:46:15.830 --> 01:46:15.840 align:start position:0%
children to make sure that they've got
 
01:46:17.870 --> 01:46:17.880 align:start position:0%
the skills that they need the resiliency
 
01:46:19.550 --> 01:46:19.560 align:start position:0%
they need and that they're they have the
 
01:46:21.870 --> 01:46:21.880 align:start position:0%
supports that they need that um that we
 
01:46:23.709 --> 01:46:23.719 align:start position:0%
can reduce the number number coming into
 
01:46:25.589 --> 01:46:25.599 align:start position:0%
those systems reduce the number coming
 
01:46:27.390 --> 01:46:27.400 align:start position:0%
into the child welfare system if we can
 
01:46:30.030 --> 01:46:30.040 align:start position:0%
do that that'll be incredibly important
 
01:46:32.189 --> 01:46:32.199 align:start position:0%
we um the pandemic was difficult the
 
01:46:33.990 --> 01:46:34.000 align:start position:0%
pandemic was socially difficult for
 
01:46:35.470 --> 01:46:35.480 align:start position:0%
everyone and that's where we've seen
 
01:46:37.229 --> 01:46:37.239 align:start position:0%
that Peak I am hoping we're going to
 
01:46:38.910 --> 01:46:38.920 align:start position:0%
start seeing some of those numbers come
 
01:46:43.229 --> 01:46:43.239 align:start position:0%
down over time so my my my final
 
01:46:45.830 --> 01:46:45.840 align:start position:0%
question what's not working with the
 
01:46:48.109 --> 01:46:48.119 align:start position:0%
with the preventative program we have
 
01:46:50.310 --> 01:46:50.320 align:start position:0%
now if the numbers are continuing to
 
01:46:51.629 --> 01:46:51.639 align:start position:0%
rise you know what that's a super
 
01:46:53.189 --> 01:46:53.199 align:start position:0%
question one of the things so some of
 
01:46:55.310 --> 01:46:55.320 align:start position:0%
the things are twofold do we have enough
 
01:46:57.189 --> 01:46:57.199 align:start position:0%
of it are we spreading it out enough are
 
01:46:58.950 --> 01:46:58.960 align:start position:0%
enough people being able to participate
 
01:47:00.870 --> 01:47:00.880 align:start position:0%
in it and prevention could be everything
 
01:47:03.550 --> 01:47:03.560 align:start position:0%
from going to the you know reading group
 
01:47:05.589 --> 01:47:05.599 align:start position:0%
at the library with your toddler you
 
01:47:07.270 --> 01:47:07.280 align:start position:0%
know it starts there it's not always a
 
01:47:09.430 --> 01:47:09.440 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
01:47:11.550 --> 01:47:11.560 align:start position:0%
Program um although some of them might
 
01:47:13.350 --> 01:47:13.360 align:start position:0%
be like our home visiting programs Our
 
01:47:15.629 --> 01:47:15.639 align:start position:0%
Family Resource Centers are they scaled
 
01:47:17.430 --> 01:47:17.440 align:start position:0%
appropriately is a question we should be
 
01:47:19.470 --> 01:47:19.480 align:start position:0%
asking ourselves and then also are we
 
01:47:21.270 --> 01:47:21.280 align:start position:0%
doing the right things that's always a
 
01:47:22.950 --> 01:47:22.960 align:start position:0%
question we should be asking ourselves
 
01:47:24.990 --> 01:47:25.000 align:start position:0%
and which is back to why I would like to
 
01:47:27.589 --> 01:47:27.599 align:start position:0%
look even more at our data around you
 
01:47:30.870 --> 01:47:30.880 align:start position:0%
know if the what are the where do we see
 
01:47:32.510 --> 01:47:32.520 align:start position:0%
kids getting better and what are the
 
01:47:34.189 --> 01:47:34.199 align:start position:0%
interventions that they've had and what
 
01:47:36.189 --> 01:47:36.199 align:start position:0%
has been supportive in their life that
 
01:47:38.870 --> 01:47:38.880 align:start position:0%
has allowed them to get better we think
 
01:47:40.510 --> 01:47:40.520 align:start position:0%
um you know we are working on the
 
01:47:43.390 --> 01:47:43.400 align:start position:0%
premise in dcyf that being in family
 
01:47:46.589 --> 01:47:46.599 align:start position:0%
being in kin may be more protective will
 
01:47:48.310 --> 01:47:48.320 align:start position:0%
always need Foster families and we love
 
01:47:50.350 --> 01:47:50.360 align:start position:0%
them and they do incredible work but we
 
01:47:52.510 --> 01:47:52.520 align:start position:0%
think that perhaps being within your own
 
01:47:54.149 --> 01:47:54.159 align:start position:0%
family unit might provide some
 
01:47:56.350 --> 01:47:56.360 align:start position:0%
additional protection and so those
 
01:47:57.589 --> 01:47:57.599 align:start position:0%
outcomes we're not going to see for
 
01:47:59.830 --> 01:47:59.840 align:start position:0%
years later thank
 
01:48:03.270 --> 01:48:03.280 align:start position:0%
you so that reminded me I I think one of
 
01:48:05.070 --> 01:48:05.080 align:start position:0%
the topics I had hoped that we would
 
01:48:07.950 --> 01:48:07.960 align:start position:0%
cover as a special event was uh Public
 
01:48:11.070 --> 01:48:11.080 align:start position:0%
Health did is have we talked about
 
01:48:13.470 --> 01:48:13.480 align:start position:0%
having Ian and the public health folks
 
01:48:17.070 --> 01:48:17.080 align:start position:0%
come in and do a okay so can can we add
 
01:48:19.669 --> 01:48:19.679 align:start position:0%
that I I think we could do that sure uh
 
01:48:21.589 --> 01:48:21.599 align:start position:0%
before the budget because it's a
 
01:48:23.350 --> 01:48:23.360 align:start position:0%
programmatic thing and I'll go to
 
01:48:26.910 --> 01:48:26.920 align:start position:0%
representative priest in a second um I I
 
01:48:28.709 --> 01:48:28.719 align:start position:0%
I just want to say one of the things
 
01:48:33.229 --> 01:48:33.239 align:start position:0%
that um I we I'm hearing us say is
 
01:48:36.709 --> 01:48:36.719 align:start position:0%
because we're here together and we have
 
01:48:41.030 --> 01:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
some capacity to solve some social ills
 
01:48:43.990 --> 01:48:44.000 align:start position:0%
it it it it gets to be I think a little
 
01:48:48.830 --> 01:48:48.840 align:start position:0%
natural for us to U forget the Primacy
 
01:48:51.510 --> 01:48:51.520 align:start position:0%
of of families and I've heard you say it
 
01:48:53.109 --> 01:48:53.119 align:start position:0%
several times so I don't think you've
 
01:48:55.990 --> 01:48:56.000 align:start position:0%
forgotten but I but I but I but I think
 
01:49:00.430 --> 01:49:00.440 align:start position:0%
you know in this era of uh family trauma
 
01:49:04.070 --> 01:49:04.080 align:start position:0%
and uh and the postco world and some
 
01:49:07.750 --> 01:49:07.760 align:start position:0%
economic stresses um I I think we almost
 
01:49:09.830 --> 01:49:09.840 align:start position:0%
have to keep thinking about how do we
 
01:49:13.510 --> 01:49:13.520 align:start position:0%
avoid the temptation to step in and
 
01:49:15.589 --> 01:49:15.599 align:start position:0%
think we're the parents of the parents
 
01:49:17.149 --> 01:49:17.159 align:start position:0%
there there there's some there's got to
 
01:49:19.830 --> 01:49:19.840 align:start position:0%
be some approaches where where where we
 
01:49:22.750 --> 01:49:22.760 align:start position:0%
can set up policy where families will
 
01:49:24.990 --> 01:49:25.000 align:start position:0%
just naturally be stronger and better at
 
01:49:28.109 --> 01:49:28.119 align:start position:0%
their job you know uh government can't
 
01:49:30.669 --> 01:49:30.679 align:start position:0%
love a kid government can't you know
 
01:49:32.629 --> 01:49:32.639 align:start position:0%
read a book to the kid at night so
 
01:49:34.030 --> 01:49:34.040 align:start position:0%
there's there's just inherent
 
01:49:36.149 --> 01:49:36.159 align:start position:0%
limitations of what we do but the
 
01:49:38.189 --> 01:49:38.199 align:start position:0%
Temptation is for us all to get together
 
01:49:41.189 --> 01:49:41.199 align:start position:0%
and try to solve the problems and I I I
 
01:49:42.589 --> 01:49:42.599 align:start position:0%
think there's some of these issues that
 
01:49:44.550 --> 01:49:44.560 align:start position:0%
are just way outside of our boundaries
 
01:49:47.750 --> 01:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
but representative priest thank you Mr
 
01:49:49.790 --> 01:49:49.800 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
01:49:52.229 --> 01:49:52.239 align:start position:0%
question out of the numbers that you are
 
01:49:55.189 --> 01:49:55.199 align:start position:0%
seeing in your community health organ
 
01:49:56.950 --> 01:49:56.960 align:start position:0%
mental health
 
01:50:01.470 --> 01:50:01.480 align:start position:0%
organizations um what percentage are
 
01:50:04.229 --> 01:50:04.239 align:start position:0%
with those individuals who have a
 
01:50:04.239 --> 01:50:05.589 align:start position:0%
with those individuals who have a
substance

01:50:05.589 --> 01:50:05.599 align:start position:0%
substance
 
01:50:08.030 --> 01:50:08.040 align:start position:0%
abuse I don't know that number off the
 
01:50:09.709 --> 01:50:09.719 align:start position:0%
top of my head I don't know if Kya knows
 
01:50:11.310 --> 01:50:11.320 align:start position:0%
that number off the top of her head we
 
01:50:13.310 --> 01:50:13.320 align:start position:0%
can get that for you but it's certainly
 
01:50:16.270 --> 01:50:16.280 align:start position:0%
they are there's a lot if I did the ven
 
01:50:17.870 --> 01:50:17.880 align:start position:0%
diagram there's you know there's
 
01:50:19.629 --> 01:50:19.639 align:start position:0%
crossover there there's no doubt about
 
01:50:21.189 --> 01:50:21.199 align:start position:0%
that I just can't tell you that number
 
01:50:23.270 --> 01:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
because I just came from a hearing
 
01:50:26.510 --> 01:50:26.520 align:start position:0%
where there was a discussion on recovery
 
01:50:30.990 --> 01:50:31.000 align:start position:0%
beds having safe certifiable recovery
 
01:50:33.589 --> 01:50:33.599 align:start position:0%
facilities for patients who have gone
 
01:50:36.030 --> 01:50:36.040 align:start position:0%
out of treatment and they're looking for
 
01:50:39.510 --> 01:50:39.520 align:start position:0%
a safe place for the next step and it
 
01:50:42.709 --> 01:50:42.719 align:start position:0%
was shown that we need 14,000 new beds
 
01:50:45.830 --> 01:50:45.840 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire we only have
 
01:50:45.840 --> 01:50:47.589 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire we only have
1,300

01:50:47.589 --> 01:50:47.599 align:start position:0%
1,300
 
01:50:50.669 --> 01:50:50.679 align:start position:0%
Statewide it's a problem these people
 
01:50:52.750 --> 01:50:52.760 align:start position:0%
are going in treatment and then then
 
01:50:54.950 --> 01:50:54.960 align:start position:0%
they're going back into treatment
 
01:50:57.229 --> 01:50:57.239 align:start position:0%
because there's no that there isn't in
 
01:51:00.069 --> 01:51:00.079 align:start position:0%
that next step absolutely and and in the
 
01:51:01.709 --> 01:51:01.719 align:start position:0%
you know I would be here for another 12
 
01:51:03.550 --> 01:51:03.560 align:start position:0%
hours boring you all to death if I had
 
01:51:04.990 --> 01:51:05.000 align:start position:0%
added all of the work that we're doing
 
01:51:07.109 --> 01:51:07.119 align:start position:0%
around substance misuse so that we
 
01:51:08.669 --> 01:51:08.679 align:start position:0%
didn't get to talk about there today but
 
01:51:10.750 --> 01:51:10.760 align:start position:0%
you're absolutely right that overlap is
 
01:51:12.669 --> 01:51:12.679 align:start position:0%
tremendous and it and again that starts
 
01:51:15.430 --> 01:51:15.440 align:start position:0%
in among youth thank you very
 
01:51:18.189 --> 01:51:18.199 align:start position:0%
much perers in
 
01:51:20.950 --> 01:51:20.960 align:start position:0%
wner mine's an announcement about the
 
01:51:23.390 --> 01:51:23.400 align:start position:0%
field trip okay
 
01:51:26.030 --> 01:51:26.040 align:start position:0%
okay so I've heard back from Waypoint
 
01:51:29.109 --> 01:51:29.119 align:start position:0%
and the date and time we picked is fine
 
01:51:31.629 --> 01:51:31.639 align:start position:0%
and I so look for an email I asked them
 
01:51:35.550 --> 01:51:35.560 align:start position:0%
to email each of us with instructions on
 
01:51:38.430 --> 01:51:38.440 align:start position:0%
where the shelter is where we should
 
01:51:41.550 --> 01:51:41.560 align:start position:0%
Park and any other kinds of U things we
 
01:51:43.910 --> 01:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
need to know about um coming into the
 
01:51:46.870 --> 01:51:46.880 align:start position:0%
facility so watch for that and I ask her
 
01:51:50.270 --> 01:51:50.280 align:start position:0%
if she wanted RSVP so she may be asking
 
01:51:53.589 --> 01:51:53.599 align:start position:0%
you to to RSVP okay just note that that
 
01:51:55.350 --> 01:51:55.360 align:start position:0%
particular program is an incredible is
 
01:51:57.270 --> 01:51:57.280 align:start position:0%
an incredible and integral part of this
 
01:51:59.270 --> 01:51:59.280 align:start position:0%
our system of care as well and
 
01:52:01.669 --> 01:52:01.679 align:start position:0%
especially again another conversation I
 
01:52:04.270 --> 01:52:04.280 align:start position:0%
could have is that really sensitive time
 
01:52:06.830 --> 01:52:06.840 align:start position:0%
of the transition to adulthood between a
 
01:52:08.589 --> 01:52:08.599 align:start position:0%
child serving system into young
 
01:52:10.310 --> 01:52:10.320 align:start position:0%
adulthood the other thing I'll just note
 
01:52:12.950 --> 01:52:12.960 align:start position:0%
to you on your um desk I think I said I
 
01:52:15.709 --> 01:52:15.719 align:start position:0%
think I noted that this is our um ages
 
01:52:17.629 --> 01:52:17.639 align:start position:0%
in rep um to answer representative
 
01:52:19.390 --> 01:52:19.400 align:start position:0%
Daniel's question around what age do we
 
01:52:21.990 --> 01:52:22.000 align:start position:0%
serve if you look at the back you'll see
 
01:52:24.189 --> 01:52:24.199 align:start position:0%
some of the supports that we provide to
 
01:52:27.189 --> 01:52:27.199 align:start position:0%
young adults coming out of the dcyf
 
01:52:29.350 --> 01:52:29.360 align:start position:0%
system knowing that that launching
 
01:52:31.470 --> 01:52:31.480 align:start position:0%
period is critically important and
 
01:52:33.870 --> 01:52:33.880 align:start position:0%
Waypoint does a great job with um their
 
01:52:36.990 --> 01:52:37.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:39.629 --> 01:52:39.639 align:start position:0%
there a represent I just have a quick
 
01:52:41.069 --> 01:52:41.079 align:start position:0%
question I came in a few minutes late
 
01:52:42.830 --> 01:52:42.840 align:start position:0%
and I just want to double check on the
 
01:52:44.790 --> 01:52:44.800 align:start position:0%
agenda um it said we were going to hear
 
01:52:46.990 --> 01:52:47.000 align:start position:0%
about individuals with disabilities is
 
01:52:48.790 --> 01:52:48.800 align:start position:0%
that the staffer who was unavailable
 
01:52:51.550 --> 01:52:51.560 align:start position:0%
today so we will have that coming thank
 
01:52:51.560 --> 01:52:52.990 align:start position:0%
today so we will have that coming thank
you

01:52:52.990 --> 01:52:53.000 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:52:56.149 --> 01:52:56.159 align:start position:0%
all right so um are there any other
 
01:52:58.350 --> 01:52:58.360 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
01:53:00.790 --> 01:53:00.800 align:start position:0%
committee uh do you have any last words
 
01:53:02.950 --> 01:53:02.960 align:start position:0%
for us anything you thought that we
 
01:53:04.390 --> 01:53:04.400 align:start position:0%
should have heard that you didn't get a
 
01:53:06.189 --> 01:53:06.199 align:start position:0%
chance to say no I just hope that
 
01:53:08.109 --> 01:53:08.119 align:start position:0%
everyone walks away having heard us
 
01:53:10.310 --> 01:53:10.320 align:start position:0%
talking about this need to make sure to
 
01:53:12.109 --> 01:53:12.119 align:start position:0%
think about those triangles again and I
 
01:53:13.270 --> 01:53:13.280 align:start position:0%
think that's been the conversation
 
01:53:15.149 --> 01:53:15.159 align:start position:0%
around the table around what's the
 
01:53:17.350 --> 01:53:17.360 align:start position:0%
appropriate scaling of resources for
 
01:53:19.030 --> 01:53:19.040 align:start position:0%
both our acute needs and the
 
01:53:20.830 --> 01:53:20.840 align:start position:0%
preventative needs and getting the right
 
01:53:23.510 --> 01:53:23.520 align:start position:0%
need right programs to the right people
 
01:53:25.870 --> 01:53:25.880 align:start position:0%
um we want to serve people when people
 
01:53:27.510 --> 01:53:27.520 align:start position:0%
have to be served to your point when
 
01:53:29.149 --> 01:53:29.159 align:start position:0%
people have a need we want to be able to
 
01:53:31.069 --> 01:53:31.079 align:start position:0%
do that as close to home whether you're
 
01:53:33.149 --> 01:53:33.159 align:start position:0%
a kid or whether you're an adult
 
01:53:34.950 --> 01:53:34.960 align:start position:0%

01:53:36.550 --> 01:53:36.560 align:start position:0%
