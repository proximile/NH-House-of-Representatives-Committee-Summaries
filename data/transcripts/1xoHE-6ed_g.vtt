not necessarily early bills we're going
 
00:07:00.029 --> 00:07:00.039 align:start position:0%
to try to get these early bills I
 
00:07:02.469 --> 00:07:02.479 align:start position:0%
handled uh so the first bill on the
 
00:07:06.869 --> 00:07:06.879 align:start position:0%
docket today is HB 609 and I recognize
 
00:07:09.469 --> 00:07:09.479 align:start position:0%
represent like is for a motion I would
 
00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:14.840 align:start position:0%

00:07:17.309 --> 00:07:17.319 align:start position:0%

00:07:23.189 --> 00:07:23.199 align:start position:0%
seconds the motion representative leak
 
00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:25.520 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak to your motion
 
00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:28.160 align:start position:0%
yes I would I
 
00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:31.720 align:start position:0%
um I would love to see this past there's
 
00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:34.280 align:start position:0%
been a lot of misinformation circling
 
00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:36.160 align:start position:0%
around and I just wanted to hit on a
 
00:07:39.029 --> 00:07:39.039 align:start position:0%
couple of those points to clear them up
 
00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
um I have heard that this ignores or
 
00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:44.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't listen to or bypasses the
 
00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:47.240 align:start position:0%
Educators and this actually starts with
 
00:07:49.749 --> 00:07:49.759 align:start position:0%
the Educators um this might be the
 
00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:51.800 align:start position:0%
teachers say we've got a great idea come
 
00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
to the principal can we do this and the
 
00:07:57.029 --> 00:07:57.039 align:start position:0%
principal says yeah but there's this
 
00:07:59.749 --> 00:07:59.759 align:start position:0%
regulation that that you know that
 
00:08:02.909 --> 00:08:02.919 align:start position:0%
preventing us from doing that so with
 
00:08:05.189 --> 00:08:05.199 align:start position:0%
this he can say but there's a process
 
00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:07.560 align:start position:0%
now for how to go about getting a waver
 
00:08:10.469 --> 00:08:10.479 align:start position:0%
for it so they can together come up with
 
00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
their plan the other thing is that I
 
00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:15.400 align:start position:0%
hear is that the collective bargaining
 
00:08:17.869 --> 00:08:17.879 align:start position:0%
agreement will be bypassed well this is
 
00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:20.120 align:start position:0%
in the planning part of this and it's
 
00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:21.800 align:start position:0%
just to say okay if you're going to plan
 
00:08:23.589 --> 00:08:23.599 align:start position:0%
this you got to make sure you got all
 
00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:26.120 align:start position:0%
your ducks in a row and everything works
 
00:08:30.189 --> 00:08:30.199 align:start position:0%
for instance if you're thinking okay um
 
00:08:33.269 --> 00:08:33.279 align:start position:0%
what as part of our plan we're going to
 
00:08:35.310 --> 00:08:35.320 align:start position:0%
change the hours of operation or change
 
00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:38.120 align:start position:0%
the start and end date of the school and
 
00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
you don't need a waiver for that but
 
00:08:41.550 --> 00:08:41.560 align:start position:0%
that might be in your collective
 
00:08:43.709 --> 00:08:43.719 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreement so this gives you
 
00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:47.120 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to go before you before
 
00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:49.200 align:start position:0%
you do all the long process you go to
 
00:08:50.949 --> 00:08:50.959 align:start position:0%
your collective bargaining unit and you
 
00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:53.120 align:start position:0%
say hey we have this idea but we're
 
00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:54.760 align:start position:0%
going to need to change this what do you
 
00:08:56.790 --> 00:08:56.800 align:start position:0%
think and they can say well we'll pull
 
00:08:59.509 --> 00:08:59.519 align:start position:0%
our members and see what they say um
 
00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:02.560 align:start position:0%
it's a checkin is what it is not a we're
 
00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:05.160 align:start position:0%
going to replace this but a check-in to
 
00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:07.320 align:start position:0%
make sure that they're not going against
 
00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:09.560 align:start position:0%
it and if they are that everybody is
 
00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:10.590 align:start position:0%
it and if they are that everybody is
with

00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:10.600 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:13.040 align:start position:0%
them and even as you go through the
 
00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:16.040 align:start position:0%
process that get plan's done cool go
 
00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:17.880 align:start position:0%
before the school board cool they like
 
00:09:20.829 --> 00:09:20.839 align:start position:0%
it uh take it to the doe the doe all
 
00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:22.800 align:start position:0%
they can say is yes or no we Grant the
 
00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:25.680 align:start position:0%
waivers they can't say you have to do
 
00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:27.920 align:start position:0%
this they that's not what this is about
 
00:09:30.949 --> 00:09:30.959 align:start position:0%
all it's doing is a abling the school to
 
00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:33.480 align:start position:0%
do what they want to do right the so the
 
00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:35.320 align:start position:0%
teachers can do what they want to do
 
00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:38.600 align:start position:0%
because we keep hearing well the
 
00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:41.200 align:start position:0%
reason um Charter Schools do so much
 
00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:42.720 align:start position:0%
better than traditional Public Schools
 
00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:44.200 align:start position:0%
is because they don't have to follow all
 
00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:46.240 align:start position:0%
these onerous regulations well this is
 
00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:49.320 align:start position:0%
here so they can say okay let's can we
 
00:09:52.389 --> 00:09:52.399 align:start position:0%
please just not do this one or two so
 
00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:54.440 align:start position:0%
that we can do this awesome plan that
 
00:09:56.790 --> 00:09:56.800 align:start position:0%
we've come up with that's all this is
 
00:09:58.750 --> 00:09:58.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you very much
 
00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:02.480 align:start position:0%
uh representative uh does the second uh
 
00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:04.600 align:start position:0%
who made the motion second the motion
 
00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:06.680 align:start position:0%
representative Leon have uh any
 
00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:09.880 align:start position:0%
discussion to add um thank you Mr chair
 
00:10:11.829 --> 00:10:11.839 align:start position:0%
I believe uh representative leus hit
 
00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:14.600 align:start position:0%
most of the points I do know that having
 
00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:16.440 align:start position:0%
the ability to have Innovation would
 
00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:18.560 align:start position:0%
have helped our schools find new
 
00:10:20.389 --> 00:10:20.399 align:start position:0%
solutions to meet the needs this year
 
00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:22.680 align:start position:0%
during covid uh
 
00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:24.720 align:start position:0%
perhaps there's so many different ways
 
00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
that they could have addressed the needs
 
00:10:27.269 --> 00:10:27.279 align:start position:0%
of both the teachers and the students
 
00:10:30.069 --> 00:10:30.079 align:start position:0%
had this been enabled and been Ed and I
 
00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:32.160 align:start position:0%
believe that allowing our schools to ask
 
00:10:34.269 --> 00:10:34.279 align:start position:0%
for this flexibility which is not forced
 
00:10:36.269 --> 00:10:36.279 align:start position:0%
upon them will benefit our teachers and
 
00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:38.240 align:start position:0%
our students so thank you thank you very
 
00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:41.360 align:start position:0%
much okay it's now open to discussion on
 
00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
the floor
 
00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:46.160 align:start position:0%
Uh repres
 
00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:48.440 align:start position:0%
Wood thank you good morning Mr chairman
 
00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:50.120 align:start position:0%
thank you happy now that your folks can
 
00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:53.920 align:start position:0%
hear me um I'd like to speak against 609
 
00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:56.560 align:start position:0%
I offer this as a teacher a former
 
00:10:59.310 --> 00:10:59.320 align:start position:0%
department chair and a former principal
 
00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:03.000 align:start position:0%
HP 609 really is a bill that is not
 
00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:06.120 align:start position:0%
needed the bill presents itself as
 
00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:07.880 align:start position:0%
legislation that would provide the
 
00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:10.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity for innovation in public
 
00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:13.240 align:start position:0%
schools however when I questioned the
 
00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:15.760 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor a week ago regarding
 
00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:18.160 align:start position:0%
Innovation and I asked him was he aware
 
00:11:19.949 --> 00:11:19.959 align:start position:0%
of any public school that could not
 
00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:22.000 align:start position:0%
innovate or was not allowed to innovate
 
00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:23.200 align:start position:0%
his answer was
 
00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:26.440 align:start position:0%
no New Hampshire has been the incubator
 
00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
for many Innovative schools and
 
00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:30.200 align:start position:0%
according once again to the
 
00:11:33.310 --> 00:11:33.320 align:start position:0%
sponsor uh and we call it we call them
 
00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:36.560 align:start position:0%
chatter schools 33 of those incubators
 
00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:37.389 align:start position:0%
chatter schools 33 of those incubators
have

00:11:37.389 --> 00:11:37.399 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:40.480 align:start position:0%
Arisen this bill this bill seems to me
 
00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:42.320 align:start position:0%
anyhow to be an attempt to break
 
00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
teachers associations if you notice on
 
00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:48.320 align:start position:0%
page2 Section 3B indicates
 
00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:50.680 align:start position:0%
that this bill also and more
 
00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:53.160 align:start position:0%
particularly lacks definition in many
 
00:11:56.389 --> 00:11:56.399 align:start position:0%
places as regards the term public school
 
00:11:57.629 --> 00:11:57.639 align:start position:0%
let me give you an
 
00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:00.160 align:start position:0%
example this is qu straight from the
 
00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:02.480 align:start position:0%
bill each public school that would be
 
00:12:04.670 --> 00:12:04.680 align:start position:0%
affected by the plan will have the
 
00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:07.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity to participate well what
 
00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:09.440 align:start position:0%
does that actually mean this is just one
 
00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
of the several places of lack of clarity
 
00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:13.880 align:start position:0%
I just heard the representative speak
 
00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:16.160 align:start position:0%
about teachers included I do not see in
 
00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:18.440 align:start position:0%
that bill unless I missed it any
 
00:12:20.949 --> 00:12:20.959 align:start position:0%
anywhere where identifies teachers
 
00:12:22.430 --> 00:12:22.440 align:start position:0%
specifically included I don't see it
 
00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:25.320 align:start position:0%
anywhere I may be wrong there seems to
 
00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:27.880 align:start position:0%
be little oversight lack of local
 
00:12:29.949 --> 00:12:29.959 align:start position:0%
control except for except for that
 
00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:31.560 align:start position:0%
initial approval by the school
 
00:12:34.030 --> 00:12:34.040 align:start position:0%
board and I may have missed a physical
 
00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:36.040 align:start position:0%
note but I didn't see one and I
 
00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
apologize if I missed
 
00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:40.880 align:start position:0%
it and finally Mr chairman this bill in
 
00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:43.880 align:start position:0%
my mind is yet just another anti-public
 
00:12:47.710 --> 00:12:47.720 align:start position:0%
education Bill we have wonderful
 
00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:49.600 align:start position:0%
creative Innovative teachers in our
 
00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:52.440 align:start position:0%
schools all across the state and to
 
00:12:54.110 --> 00:12:54.120 align:start position:0%
present this bill seems to me to be a
 
00:12:57.350 --> 00:12:57.360 align:start position:0%
front to that faculty they are working
 
00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:00.680 align:start position:0%
above and beyond especially now in the
 
00:13:03.230 --> 00:13:03.240 align:start position:0%
innovating every day trying to make our
 
00:13:05.269 --> 00:13:05.279 align:start position:0%
students successful during this crazy
 
00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:07.560 align:start position:0%
year of the hybrid destruction I suggest
 
00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:09.880 align:start position:0%
you again Mr chair this bill is not
 
00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:12.720 align:start position:0%
needed thank you thank you very much
 
00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:23.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:26.949 --> 00:13:26.959 align:start position:0%
discussion rer uh thank you Mr chair I
 
00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:29.600 align:start position:0%
would just uh uh underscore some of the
 
00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:32.040 align:start position:0%
things that representative Woodcock said
 
00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:33.880 align:start position:0%
uh in in bills like this that have been
 
00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:35.920 align:start position:0%
taking place across the country the
 
00:13:38.389 --> 00:13:38.399 align:start position:0%
little states that do have them there is
 
00:13:41.509 --> 00:13:41.519 align:start position:0%
clearly a guarantee of of teacher
 
00:13:43.069 --> 00:13:43.079 align:start position:0%
involvement in the creation of an
 
00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:46.360 align:start position:0%
Innovative school this bill absent at
 
00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:48.880 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding representative leak's
 
00:13:51.269 --> 00:13:51.279 align:start position:0%
comments if in fact you really want
 
00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:54.040 align:start position:0%
teachers involved in this process that
 
00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:55.320 align:start position:0%
should be part of the bill which it's
 
00:13:57.509 --> 00:13:57.519 align:start position:0%
not right now the other thing that I
 
00:13:58.870 --> 00:13:58.880 align:start position:0%
think we need to realize is that that
 
00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:00.920 align:start position:0%
there's a presumption here perhaps that
 
00:14:02.629 --> 00:14:02.639 align:start position:0%
there's not Innovation going on in
 
00:14:04.990 --> 00:14:05.000 align:start position:0%
schools that's that's entirely
 
00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:08.120 align:start position:0%
incorrect one of the reasons why our
 
00:14:11.949 --> 00:14:11.959 align:start position:0%
state has been ranked in the top five
 
00:14:14.749 --> 00:14:14.759 align:start position:0%
top three in the country is because of
 
00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:17.360 align:start position:0%
innovation we have kept up with the
 
00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:19.480 align:start position:0%
needs of students with the needs of
 
00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:23.440 align:start position:0%
Technology Etc this bill is not needed
 
00:14:25.829 --> 00:14:25.839 align:start position:0%
if in fact a school a a local school
 
00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:27.880 align:start position:0%
district wanted to have quote an
 
00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:29.360 align:start position:0%
Innovative School they could create a
 
00:14:33.389 --> 00:14:33.399 align:start position:0%
charter school that is currently in law
 
00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:35.560 align:start position:0%
this bill really is not needed at this
 
00:14:37.749 --> 00:14:37.759 align:start position:0%
point in time thank you thank you very
 
00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:40.040 align:start position:0%
much representative Myer representative
 
00:14:44.990 --> 00:14:45.000 align:start position:0%
Shaw yes um I signed on to this bill and
 
00:14:48.829 --> 00:14:48.839 align:start position:0%
because I'm I'm an Innovative person I I
 
00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:51.560 align:start position:0%
I like change I like things that are are
 
00:14:55.710 --> 00:14:55.720 align:start position:0%
good for kids and and but after and I
 
00:14:59.389 --> 00:14:59.399 align:start position:0%
apologize to the prime sponsor um
 
00:15:03.189 --> 00:15:03.199 align:start position:0%
I I cannot support it at this time
 
00:15:05.269 --> 00:15:05.279 align:start position:0%
because I've been thinking seriously
 
00:15:08.590 --> 00:15:08.600 align:start position:0%
about it and points that representative
 
00:15:12.069 --> 00:15:12.079 align:start position:0%
Woodcock brought up I was going to uh
 
00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:15.680 align:start position:0%
elaborate on but uh it's fine and what
 
00:15:18.949 --> 00:15:18.959 align:start position:0%
representative Miler just said uh about
 
00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:21.240 align:start position:0%
the Innovation
 
00:15:24.629 --> 00:15:24.639 align:start position:0%
really we have had schools in our in our
 
00:15:28.269 --> 00:15:28.279 align:start position:0%
city that have adopted programs of
 
00:15:30.949 --> 00:15:30.959 align:start position:0%
specific spefic Innovation and have
 
00:15:34.749 --> 00:15:34.759 align:start position:0%
operated in in that Way Parker VY school
 
00:15:39.269 --> 00:15:39.279 align:start position:0%
and and a couple of others so um I I I
 
00:15:42.269 --> 00:15:42.279 align:start position:0%
will not support it at this time thank
 
00:15:44.269 --> 00:15:44.279 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much representative
 
00:15:49.949 --> 00:15:49.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:52.920 align:start position:0%
discussion is there anybody present here
 
00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
that once we have a request from
 
00:15:57.150 --> 00:15:57.160 align:start position:0%
represent leas again but that would be
 
00:15:59.350 --> 00:15:59.360 align:start position:0%
the second time she would have
 
00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
discuss represent
 
00:16:05.509 --> 00:16:05.519 align:start position:0%
Tanner and Ellis thank you Mr chair I
 
00:16:07.629 --> 00:16:07.639 align:start position:0%
was just wondering uh representative
 
00:16:09.749 --> 00:16:09.759 align:start position:0%
Woodcock mentioned and I I noticed that
 
00:16:11.590 --> 00:16:11.600 align:start position:0%
I don't have a fiscal note for this
 
00:16:13.629 --> 00:16:13.639 align:start position:0%
particular bill either could someone
 
00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:15.920 align:start position:0%
explain why there's no fiscal note and
 
00:16:27.509 --> 00:16:27.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:27.519 --> 00:16:29.150 align:start position:0%
 
estimate

00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:29.160 align:start position:0%
estimate
 
00:16:31.069 --> 00:16:31.079 align:start position:0%
like us yeah I was going to touch on a
 
00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:33.240 align:start position:0%
couple of those points one of them is
 
00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:35.360 align:start position:0%
there's no fiscal note because there
 
00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:37.240 align:start position:0%
can't be it's an innovation we don't
 
00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:39.480 align:start position:0%
know what it's going to be so there's no
 
00:16:42.189 --> 00:16:42.199 align:start position:0%
way of being able to assign a cost there
 
00:16:44.069 --> 00:16:44.079 align:start position:0%
might be no cost there might be a cost
 
00:16:46.350 --> 00:16:46.360 align:start position:0%
saving we don't know it depends upon
 
00:16:49.389 --> 00:16:49.399 align:start position:0%
what the school wants to do um number
 
00:16:52.990 --> 00:16:53.000 align:start position:0%
two it says as far as who it says a
 
00:16:55.309 --> 00:16:55.319 align:start position:0%
public school well who is the majority
 
00:16:57.269 --> 00:16:57.279 align:start position:0%
of a public school it's the teachers
 
00:16:59.230 --> 00:16:59.240 align:start position:0%
right they're the Maj and the most
 
00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:01.120 align:start position:0%
important part of a public school so to
 
00:17:04.189 --> 00:17:04.199 align:start position:0%
me this is that's built into a public
 
00:17:07.350 --> 00:17:07.360 align:start position:0%
school is the teachers and the staff and
 
00:17:10.309 --> 00:17:10.319 align:start position:0%
everybody so that's all of the people at
 
00:17:13.590 --> 00:17:13.600 align:start position:0%
the public school may come up with this
 
00:17:19.110 --> 00:17:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:21.760 align:start position:0%
other sorry there was one more point
 
00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
that you guys had made that I was going
 
00:17:26.870 --> 00:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
to explain why it's worded the way it is
 
00:17:29.669 --> 00:17:29.679 align:start position:0%
oh I know what it was not all schools
 
00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:31.400 align:start position:0%
want to become Charter Schools they
 
00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:34.280 align:start position:0%
don't want to do make the big change
 
00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:36.480 align:start position:0%
they just want to want to waiver for a
 
00:17:39.029 --> 00:17:39.039 align:start position:0%
few things and this is more a procedure
 
00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:42.360 align:start position:0%
than anything to help with how you would
 
00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:45.360 align:start position:0%
go about doing that to make it easier to
 
00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:48.600 align:start position:0%
say do this and then this and then this
 
00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:51.520 align:start position:0%
to to make it easier to be able to lay
 
00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
out a plan and make sure you've hit all
 
00:17:57.470 --> 00:17:57.480 align:start position:0%
the points um in order to wave just a
 
00:17:59.950 --> 00:17:59.960 align:start position:0%
few things in order order to have a plan
 
00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:01.960 align:start position:0%
that the teachers and administrators
 
00:18:04.149 --> 00:18:04.159 align:start position:0%
would like to try in their school that's
 
00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:05.720 align:start position:0%
thank you very much represent leas for
 
00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:08.400 align:start position:0%
responding regarding that fiscal
 
00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:12.240 align:start position:0%
question Ellison had his hand represent
 
00:18:15.430 --> 00:18:15.440 align:start position:0%
Ellison thank you Mr chairman uh I I'd
 
00:18:17.789 --> 00:18:17.799 align:start position:0%
like to get some more clarification if I
 
00:18:21.310 --> 00:18:21.320 align:start position:0%
can on the uh collective bargaining
 
00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:23.320 align:start position:0%
issue that's been brought up it would
 
00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:28.640 align:start position:0%
seem to me that if a school decided or
 
00:18:30.549 --> 00:18:30.559 align:start position:0%
wanted to go with an Innovative school
 
00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
and wanted to pay teachers less than
 
00:18:35.830 --> 00:18:35.840 align:start position:0%
what they were what was in the
 
00:18:37.630 --> 00:18:37.640 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining agreement at this
 
00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:40.880 align:start position:0%
point that the entire package would have
 
00:18:44.070 --> 00:18:44.080 align:start position:0%
to go back to the bargaining unit which
 
00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
would be the teachers to be voted upon
 
00:18:50.430 --> 00:18:50.440 align:start position:0%
uh I I just want to be sure that that's
 
00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:52.510 align:start position:0%
uh I I just want to be sure that that's
the

00:18:52.510 --> 00:18:52.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
understanding it's my to to and you
 
00:18:57.470 --> 00:18:57.480 align:start position:0%
respond to that represent Allison it's
 
00:18:59.590 --> 00:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
my understanding that in the bill it
 
00:19:01.549 --> 00:19:01.559 align:start position:0%
specifies that the collective bargaining
 
00:19:03.310 --> 00:19:03.320 align:start position:0%
agreement in effect for personnel at the
 
00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
public school that would need to be
 
00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:09.200 align:start position:0%
waved uh in the public school or excuse
 
00:19:11.710 --> 00:19:11.720 align:start position:0%
me waved or modified for the public
 
00:19:13.909 --> 00:19:13.919 align:start position:0%
school to implement its intended or
 
00:19:16.830 --> 00:19:16.840 align:start position:0%
identified Innovation so that as I'm
 
00:19:18.549 --> 00:19:18.559 align:start position:0%
reading it that would have to come back
 
00:19:20.669 --> 00:19:20.679 align:start position:0%
to the uh collective bargaining
 
00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:23.600 align:start position:0%
agreement and that would have to be
 
00:19:27.789 --> 00:19:27.799 align:start position:0%
waved um U by the folks involved with
 
00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:30.720 align:start position:0%
the collector barbing agreement uh prior
 
00:19:34.110 --> 00:19:34.120 align:start position:0%
to uh moving forward I'll go ahead and
 
00:19:37.270 --> 00:19:37.280 align:start position:0%
uh recognize representative cordelli
 
00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:41.400 align:start position:0%
thank you um thank you Mr chairman um on
 
00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:44.320 align:start position:0%
that point I would say that it's in that
 
00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
section of the uh
 
00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:50.400 align:start position:0%
legislation uh as a matter of
 
00:19:53.909 --> 00:19:53.919 align:start position:0%
transparency as part of the plan if the
 
00:19:56.669 --> 00:19:56.679 align:start position:0%
Administration has negotiated anything
 
00:19:58.669 --> 00:19:58.679 align:start position:0%
with the bargaining unit it should be
 
00:20:01.470 --> 00:20:01.480 align:start position:0%
part of the plan so that uh the school
 
00:20:03.710 --> 00:20:03.720 align:start position:0%
board knows about it there's a public
 
00:20:05.669 --> 00:20:05.679 align:start position:0%
hearing everybody knows about it it's
 
00:20:08.590 --> 00:20:08.600 align:start position:0%
transparency that's why it's there uh
 
00:20:12.789 --> 00:20:12.799 align:start position:0%
secondly in terms of um the fiscal note
 
00:20:15.390 --> 00:20:15.400 align:start position:0%
this is basically enabling legislation
 
00:20:19.549 --> 00:20:19.559 align:start position:0%
it's enabling uh a school district to uh
 
00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:24.360 align:start position:0%
request waivers uh that's s simply it
 
00:20:28.510 --> 00:20:28.520 align:start position:0%
um I would think that the situ ation
 
00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:32.320 align:start position:0%
we're in over the next decade uh looking
 
00:20:36.149 --> 00:20:36.159 align:start position:0%
at enrollment declines of 20,000 or more
 
00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:38.400 align:start position:0%
students uh school districts are going
 
00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:42.360 align:start position:0%
to have to change and modify this bill
 
00:20:45.230 --> 00:20:45.240 align:start position:0%
will enable them to do that don't need
 
00:20:47.950 --> 00:20:47.960 align:start position:0%
that uh to uh get waivers from current
 
00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:50.480 align:start position:0%
rules so that they can innovate and also
 
00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:54.480 align:start position:0%
realize cost savings as we approach or
 
00:20:56.470 --> 00:20:56.480 align:start position:0%
as we're in the midst of a declining
 
00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
demographics okay thank you very much uh
 
00:21:10.830 --> 00:21:10.840 align:start position:0%
at this point in time on this bill I
 
00:21:12.830 --> 00:21:12.840 align:start position:0%
want to make clear that we have not
 
00:21:14.630 --> 00:21:14.640 align:start position:0%
received a fiscal note regarding this
 
00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:16.149 align:start position:0%
received a fiscal note regarding this
from

00:21:16.149 --> 00:21:16.159 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:21:21.390 --> 00:21:21.400 align:start position:0%
Boe um who was next Le and then Corell
 
00:21:23.710 --> 00:21:23.720 align:start position:0%
okay represent LE uh thank you Mr
 
00:21:25.630 --> 00:21:25.640 align:start position:0%
chairman um so I just want to uh make
 
00:21:28.789 --> 00:21:28.799 align:start position:0%
sure I understand so
 
00:21:31.909 --> 00:21:31.919 align:start position:0%
I know uh my colleague representative Le
 
00:21:33.870 --> 00:21:33.880 align:start position:0%
has said that um you know teachers could
 
00:21:38.510 --> 00:21:38.520 align:start position:0%
propose this Etc could conceivably a uh
 
00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:40.880 align:start position:0%
single or two people who are not
 
00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:43.120 align:start position:0%
Educators at all or are not teachers
 
00:21:45.950 --> 00:21:45.960 align:start position:0%
let's say uh propose this and uh
 
00:21:47.549 --> 00:21:47.559 align:start position:0%
persuade the school board to go ahead
 
00:21:49.470 --> 00:21:49.480 align:start position:0%
with it without consulting teachers in
 
00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:52.200 align:start position:0%
advance can they do that a yes or
 
00:21:56.789 --> 00:21:56.799 align:start position:0%
no represent uh Corell or whomever yeah
 
00:22:01.110 --> 00:22:01.120 align:start position:0%
Whoever has yeah um clearly in the bill
 
00:22:04.750 --> 00:22:04.760 align:start position:0%
there is a local planning process uh any
 
00:22:07.230 --> 00:22:07.240 align:start position:0%
plan that is originated has to go
 
00:22:09.430 --> 00:22:09.440 align:start position:0%
through the the school board and a
 
00:22:12.070 --> 00:22:12.080 align:start position:0%
public hearing wasn't the question
 
00:22:15.230 --> 00:22:15.240 align:start position:0%
that's again the question is though can
 
00:22:17.470 --> 00:22:17.480 align:start position:0%
a plan be proposed without having prior
 
00:22:20.070 --> 00:22:20.080 align:start position:0%
consultation with the teachers yes or
 
00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:24.360 align:start position:0%
no I would think that any plan uh
 
00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:26.960 align:start position:0%
proposed by anyone in the school is
 
00:22:28.590 --> 00:22:28.600 align:start position:0%
going to go through
 
00:22:30.789 --> 00:22:30.799 align:start position:0%
uh the administration and the school
 
00:22:33.710 --> 00:22:33.720 align:start position:0%
board so therefore the teachers do not
 
00:22:36.750 --> 00:22:36.760 align:start position:0%
need to be consulted is that correct
 
00:22:39.149 --> 00:22:39.159 align:start position:0%
approval pardon is that what you're
 
00:22:41.230 --> 00:22:41.240 align:start position:0%
requesting that uh a plan has to get
 
00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:43.400 align:start position:0%
Union approval is that I didn't say
 
00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:45.440 align:start position:0%
Union uh I'm not saying Union I'm just
 
00:22:47.909 --> 00:22:47.919 align:start position:0%
asking teachers I'm just asking teachers
 
00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:50.640 align:start position:0%
Mr representative
 
00:22:53.470 --> 00:22:53.480 align:start position:0%
cordelli okay let's go on with I'm not
 
00:22:55.990 --> 00:22:56.000 align:start position:0%
Excuse me yes I'm not finished no I was
 
00:22:57.789 --> 00:22:57.799 align:start position:0%
going to say if you had another question
 
00:23:02.310 --> 00:23:02.320 align:start position:0%
oh thank you yes I do um so um if a plan
 
00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:05.120 align:start position:0%
is put forward and receives a Department
 
00:23:06.549 --> 00:23:06.559 align:start position:0%
of Education approval and they're
 
00:23:08.669 --> 00:23:08.679 align:start position:0%
allowed to go forward can the bargaining
 
00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
unit or the agent representing the um
 
00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:14.080 align:start position:0%
employees in the school district uh
 
00:23:16.350 --> 00:23:16.360 align:start position:0%
affected or where whose contract may
 
00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:18.760 align:start position:0%
have Provisions modified or waved can
 
00:23:21.269 --> 00:23:21.279 align:start position:0%
they thereby reject it and thereby uh
 
00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:29.669 --> 00:23:29.679 align:start position:0%
plan yes go ahead
 
00:23:32.669 --> 00:23:32.679 align:start position:0%
um there's several steps in the process
 
00:23:35.230 --> 00:23:35.240 align:start position:0%
yeah school board approval a public
 
00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:38.000 align:start position:0%
hearing as part of that process it goes
 
00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:40.400 align:start position:0%
to the Department of Education for
 
00:23:43.390 --> 00:23:43.400 align:start position:0%
review and and comment um and any
 
00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
suggestions on improving the plan um I
 
00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:50.760 align:start position:0%
think we heard testimony uh from was it
 
00:23:53.789 --> 00:23:53.799 align:start position:0%
this um the department or the Board of
 
00:23:57.549 --> 00:23:57.559 align:start position:0%
Education that they have no um ability
 
00:24:00.269 --> 00:24:00.279 align:start position:0%
to to okay a plan that affects a
 
00:24:05.029 --> 00:24:05.039 align:start position:0%
bargaining unit um without uh agreement
 
00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:07.440 align:start position:0%
on the a part of the bargaining unit
 
00:24:09.909 --> 00:24:09.919 align:start position:0%
because it goes through the department
 
00:24:12.029 --> 00:24:12.039 align:start position:0%
then to the State Board of Education
 
00:24:14.190 --> 00:24:14.200 align:start position:0%
where there is another public hearing
 
00:24:18.029 --> 00:24:18.039 align:start position:0%
before the uh state board uh votes on
 
00:24:19.830 --> 00:24:19.840 align:start position:0%
the waiver
 
00:24:23.149 --> 00:24:23.159 align:start position:0%
request so in other words if there is no
 
00:24:25.789 --> 00:24:25.799 align:start position:0%
uh prior let's say agreement on
 
00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:28.440 align:start position:0%
modifying or waving provisions of a
 
00:24:30.590 --> 00:24:30.600 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining agreement let's
 
00:24:32.389 --> 00:24:32.399 align:start position:0%
just say the plan went was put forward
 
00:24:35.630 --> 00:24:35.640 align:start position:0%
without the prior agreement um in place
 
00:24:37.750 --> 00:24:37.760 align:start position:0%
um with the bargaining unit agent then
 
00:24:39.950 --> 00:24:39.960 align:start position:0%
therefore um the bargaining unit could
 
00:24:43.310 --> 00:24:43.320 align:start position:0%
still simply afterwards by rejecting The
 
00:24:45.870 --> 00:24:45.880 align:start position:0%
Proposal halt the plan is that correct
 
00:24:47.110 --> 00:24:47.120 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to make sure I
 
00:24:48.909 --> 00:24:48.919 align:start position:0%
understand the process here I think your
 
00:24:52.590 --> 00:24:52.600 align:start position:0%
assumption is that um the uh
 
00:24:56.430 --> 00:24:56.440 align:start position:0%
Administration and the school board um
 
00:24:59.230 --> 00:24:59.240 align:start position:0%
are going to go forward with a plan that
 
00:25:02.310 --> 00:25:02.320 align:start position:0%
modifies the uh collective bargaining
 
00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:07.080 align:start position:0%
agreement without um uh going back and
 
00:25:09.909 --> 00:25:09.919 align:start position:0%
negotiating that that change um I think
 
00:25:11.870 --> 00:25:11.880 align:start position:0%
you in that case you would have uh
 
00:25:13.389 --> 00:25:13.399 align:start position:0%
issues with the Department of Labor as
 
00:25:16.149 --> 00:25:16.159 align:start position:0%
well possibly yeah yeah I mean I I agree
 
00:25:17.950 --> 00:25:17.960 align:start position:0%
with you I think it would be uh foolish
 
00:25:19.590 --> 00:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
to go ahead and do it although I have
 
00:25:22.350 --> 00:25:22.360 align:start position:0%
seen stranger things in this world so um
 
00:25:24.470 --> 00:25:24.480 align:start position:0%
I cannot rule it out I I have one other
 
00:25:26.430 --> 00:25:26.440 align:start position:0%
just question here and that is um at the
 
00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:28.640 align:start position:0%
end of the bill near the end of the bill
 
00:25:30.470 --> 00:25:30.480 align:start position:0%
the department finds the Innovation plan
 
00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:32.240 align:start position:0%
performance is not satisfactory they
 
00:25:35.230 --> 00:25:35.240 align:start position:0%
shall notify the local uh board and the
 
00:25:37.070 --> 00:25:37.080 align:start position:0%
State Board what are the metrics that
 
00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:44.240 align:start position:0%
waved in other words to measure whether
 
00:25:47.590 --> 00:25:47.600 align:start position:0%
or not an innovation is succeeding or
 
00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:51.480 align:start position:0%
not uh go ahead yeah thank you chairman
 
00:25:53.950 --> 00:25:53.960 align:start position:0%
um there are several things mentioned in
 
00:25:58.070 --> 00:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
the plan um excuse me in the legislation
 
00:26:00.669 --> 00:26:00.679 align:start position:0%
um I think the metrics are what is put
 
00:26:02.789 --> 00:26:02.799 align:start position:0%
forward in the plan what are the
 
00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:05.440 align:start position:0%
expectations um in the plan that has
 
00:26:09.430 --> 00:26:09.440 align:start position:0%
been approved um are they expecting um
 
00:26:13.149 --> 00:26:13.159 align:start position:0%
cost savings are they uh expecting um
 
00:26:16.430 --> 00:26:16.440 align:start position:0%
greater uh achievement uh scores uh
 
00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:18.720 align:start position:0%
those types of things and that's what uh
 
00:26:21.950 --> 00:26:21.960 align:start position:0%
You' be looking at is going back to the
 
00:26:23.830 --> 00:26:23.840 align:start position:0%
plan what did the plan wish to
 
00:26:25.470 --> 00:26:25.480 align:start position:0%
accomplish and those would be the
 
00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:28.640 align:start position:0%
metrics that you look at
 
00:26:31.269 --> 00:26:31.279 align:start position:0%
thank you very much okay thank you thank
 
00:26:33.870 --> 00:26:33.880 align:start position:0%
you rep Corell re
 
00:26:36.269 --> 00:26:36.279 align:start position:0%
Cornell I just want to speak to rep
 
00:26:38.190 --> 00:26:38.200 align:start position:0%
woodcock's statement that it's not
 
00:26:39.990 --> 00:26:40.000 align:start position:0%
needed because New Hampshire allows
 
00:26:42.149 --> 00:26:42.159 align:start position:0%
Innovation I just want to mention
 
00:26:44.549 --> 00:26:44.559 align:start position:0%
Manchester High School West steam
 
00:26:47.630 --> 00:26:47.640 align:start position:0%
program which is an Innovative program
 
00:26:51.510 --> 00:26:51.520 align:start position:0%
within West High School where students
 
00:26:55.750 --> 00:26:55.760 align:start position:0%
um apply to be in it um and it has
 
00:26:57.870 --> 00:26:57.880 align:start position:0%
Partnerships with local community
 
00:27:00.990 --> 00:27:01.000 align:start position:0%
colleges local businesses um and it's an
 
00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:05.200 align:start position:0%
Innovative program that emphasizes stem
 
00:27:09.470 --> 00:27:09.480 align:start position:0%
subjects within the school um so all it
 
00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:11.640 align:start position:0%
needed was Schoolboard approval to do
 
00:27:14.549 --> 00:27:14.559 align:start position:0%
that um there was no legislation needed
 
00:27:16.590 --> 00:27:16.600 align:start position:0%
to do that and they still have to do the
 
00:27:18.950 --> 00:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
requirements for graduation and meet
 
00:27:21.149 --> 00:27:21.159 align:start position:0%
everything else but it's a concentration
 
00:27:23.630 --> 00:27:23.640 align:start position:0%
within the school so I I don't think
 
00:27:26.389 --> 00:27:26.399 align:start position:0%
this legislation is needed in order to
 
00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:28.720 align:start position:0%
do this it's just the willingness of the
 
00:27:31.310 --> 00:27:31.320 align:start position:0%
school to get together and plan it
 
00:27:34.389 --> 00:27:34.399 align:start position:0%
that's all thank you represent Mullen
 
00:27:37.029 --> 00:27:37.039 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um I I am going to
 
00:27:38.950 --> 00:27:38.960 align:start position:0%
ask for a point of clarification I guess
 
00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:41.840 align:start position:0%
from representative cordelli um on page
 
00:27:44.310 --> 00:27:44.320 align:start position:0%
four of the original legislation in the
 
00:27:48.110 --> 00:27:48.120 align:start position:0%
section that is entitled on line 19
 
00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
Innovation plans waiver of regulatory
 
00:27:55.830 --> 00:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
requirements uh Roman 1 says upon the
 
00:27:58.830 --> 00:27:58.840 align:start position:0%
designation of an innov ation school or
 
00:28:02.509 --> 00:28:02.519 align:start position:0%
school zone the State Board shall wave
 
00:28:05.950 --> 00:28:05.960 align:start position:0%
compliance with any administrative rules
 
00:28:08.830 --> 00:28:08.840 align:start position:0%
specified at the local District
 
00:28:12.430 --> 00:28:12.440 align:start position:0%
level uh that to to me uh representative
 
00:28:16.149 --> 00:28:16.159 align:start position:0%
cordelli is a very broad statement and
 
00:28:18.509 --> 00:28:18.519 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if you could elaborate a
 
00:28:22.630 --> 00:28:22.640 align:start position:0%
little bit on whether or not this means
 
00:28:27.029 --> 00:28:27.039 align:start position:0%
that once an Innovative plan is adopted
 
00:28:30.070 --> 00:28:30.080 align:start position:0%
then the state board will automatically
 
00:28:33.190 --> 00:28:33.200 align:start position:0%
wave all aspects of administrative rules
 
00:28:37.549 --> 00:28:37.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:39.909 --> 00:28:39.919 align:start position:0%
correct yes go ahead yes go ahead thanks
 
00:28:41.909 --> 00:28:41.919 align:start position:0%
for the question um I do not believe
 
00:28:44.789 --> 00:28:44.799 align:start position:0%
that is correct uh the plan that is put
 
00:28:48.110 --> 00:28:48.120 align:start position:0%
forward for approval at the local board
 
00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:51.360 align:start position:0%
uh department and state board level
 
00:28:57.029 --> 00:28:57.039 align:start position:0%
um uh indicates the regulations that are
 
00:28:59.710 --> 00:28:59.720 align:start position:0%
to be W and that is what is being
 
00:29:03.870 --> 00:29:03.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:06.070 --> 00:29:06.080 align:start position:0%
referen thank you further question
 
00:29:10.029 --> 00:29:10.039 align:start position:0%
represent M uh just a followup to that
 
00:29:12.789 --> 00:29:12.799 align:start position:0%
so representative cordelli when it says
 
00:29:15.990 --> 00:29:16.000 align:start position:0%
the administrative rules specified at in
 
00:29:19.830 --> 00:29:19.840 align:start position:0%
the Local District plan is that in
 
00:29:22.870 --> 00:29:22.880 align:start position:0%
reference to the Innovative School plan
 
00:29:27.430 --> 00:29:27.440 align:start position:0%
or is it the Local District plan for the
 
00:29:30.269 --> 00:29:30.279 align:start position:0%
delivery of public education it is in
 
00:29:32.470 --> 00:29:32.480 align:start position:0%
the Innovation plan put forward by the
 
00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:33.269 align:start position:0%
the Innovation plan put forward by the
local

00:29:33.269 --> 00:29:33.279 align:start position:0%
local
 
00:29:37.190 --> 00:29:37.200 align:start position:0%
board okay uh thank you that was unclear
 
00:29:40.149 --> 00:29:40.159 align:start position:0%
thank thank you further further
 
00:29:43.669 --> 00:29:43.679 align:start position:0%
questions represent alloy thank you Mr
 
00:29:47.310 --> 00:29:47.320 align:start position:0%
chairman um I just wanted to state that
 
00:29:51.029 --> 00:29:51.039 align:start position:0%
uh I I do support this bill and I
 
00:29:54.350 --> 00:29:54.360 align:start position:0%
support it uh because I find it uh
 
00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:55.909 align:start position:0%
support it uh because I find it uh
rather

00:29:55.909 --> 00:29:55.919 align:start position:0%
rather
 
00:29:58.509 --> 00:29:58.519 align:start position:0%
innocuous uh I don't see it as a threat
 
00:30:01.549 --> 00:30:01.559 align:start position:0%
to anything that's going on currently
 
00:30:04.870 --> 00:30:04.880 align:start position:0%
and it may open the doors uh for further
 
00:30:07.870 --> 00:30:07.880 align:start position:0%
uh Innovation down the road having said
 
00:30:10.750 --> 00:30:10.760 align:start position:0%
that uh I would also want to acknowledge
 
00:30:13.190 --> 00:30:13.200 align:start position:0%
the points made by representative
 
00:30:17.029 --> 00:30:17.039 align:start position:0%
Woodcock and and representative Miler uh
 
00:30:19.230 --> 00:30:19.240 align:start position:0%
that there is no shortage of innovation
 
00:30:21.230 --> 00:30:21.240 align:start position:0%
currently ongoing in New Hampshire
 
00:30:23.750 --> 00:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
schools and uh there's something to be
 
00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:26.240 align:start position:0%
proud of uh this bill
 
00:30:29.070 --> 00:30:29.080 align:start position:0%
just give someone the opportunity to
 
00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:32.480 align:start position:0%
keep that ball roll thank thank you very
 
00:30:37.269 --> 00:30:37.279 align:start position:0%
much further questions uh represent luno
 
00:30:39.110 --> 00:30:39.120 align:start position:0%
uh thank you very much Mr chair and this
 
00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:41.120 align:start position:0%
is probably more of a point of
 
00:30:45.269 --> 00:30:45.279 align:start position:0%
information but um I was wondering if um
 
00:30:48.269 --> 00:30:48.279 align:start position:0%
uh if we could have the um the results
 
00:30:50.710 --> 00:30:50.720 align:start position:0%
or the tallies on the um what what I
 
00:30:52.710 --> 00:30:52.720 align:start position:0%
would sort of refer to as the blue
 
00:30:56.350 --> 00:30:56.360 align:start position:0%
sheets and um and the my second part of
 
00:30:58.070 --> 00:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
my point of information
 
00:31:01.310 --> 00:31:01.320 align:start position:0%
is um how do members of the public have
 
00:31:04.710 --> 00:31:04.720 align:start position:0%
access to the blue sheets and to the uh
 
00:31:07.230 --> 00:31:07.240 align:start position:0%
list of people that are signed up to
 
00:31:08.629 --> 00:31:08.639 align:start position:0%
testify I know we've got a hearing
 
00:31:10.870 --> 00:31:10.880 align:start position:0%
coming up this
 
00:31:13.710 --> 00:31:13.720 align:start position:0%
afternoon the blue sheets are for if
 
00:31:15.389 --> 00:31:15.399 align:start position:0%
you're talking about for hearings that
 
00:31:17.629 --> 00:31:17.639 align:start position:0%
are coming up uh we will be provided
 
00:31:20.269 --> 00:31:20.279 align:start position:0%
that information around noon time on on
 
00:31:22.350 --> 00:31:22.360 align:start position:0%
the most current they're constantly
 
00:31:25.830 --> 00:31:25.840 align:start position:0%
changing uh so rather getting a sheet at
 
00:31:28.990 --> 00:31:29.000 align:start position:0%
this moment uh we prefer to receive that
 
00:31:30.870 --> 00:31:30.880 align:start position:0%
and have asked to receive the most
 
00:31:33.230 --> 00:31:33.240 align:start position:0%
current information we have prior to
 
00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:35.880 align:start position:0%
starting the hearing no I'm I'm I'm the
 
00:31:39.509 --> 00:31:39.519 align:start position:0%
blue sheet I'm talking about is is on
 
00:31:42.269 --> 00:31:42.279 align:start position:0%
609 relative to this bill part of the
 
00:31:44.990 --> 00:31:45.000 align:start position:0%
record what's that they're all part of
 
00:31:46.190 --> 00:31:46.200 align:start position:0%
the record the
 
00:31:48.629 --> 00:31:48.639 align:start position:0%
number could you could you read out that
 
00:31:51.629 --> 00:31:51.639 align:start position:0%
number because we don't have access to
 
00:31:54.190 --> 00:31:54.200 align:start position:0%
it we we do not have that file in front
 
00:31:56.310 --> 00:31:56.320 align:start position:0%
of us right now that is upstairs as
 
00:31:59.750 --> 00:31:59.760 align:start position:0%
we've had in the past P um uh we've had
 
00:32:02.149 --> 00:32:02.159 align:start position:0%
that available to us but electronically
 
00:32:03.470 --> 00:32:03.480 align:start position:0%
we have not been provided that
 
00:32:06.269 --> 00:32:06.279 align:start position:0%
information here it is available and we
 
00:32:09.190 --> 00:32:09.200 align:start position:0%
will get that to you but wouldn't would
 
00:32:13.950 --> 00:32:13.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:16.990 --> 00:32:17.000 align:start position:0%
vote Yes we we read the results
 
00:32:18.909 --> 00:32:18.919 align:start position:0%
following the hearing so you should have
 
00:32:18.919 --> 00:32:21.269 align:start position:0%
following the hearing so you should have
that

00:32:21.269 --> 00:32:21.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:24.070 --> 00:32:24.080 align:start position:0%
information and what were those
 
00:32:26.509 --> 00:32:26.519 align:start position:0%
results you should have that information
 
00:32:28.269 --> 00:32:28.279 align:start position:0%
they were read I don't have those
 
00:32:30.310 --> 00:32:30.320 align:start position:0%
results in front of me but they were
 
00:32:34.350 --> 00:32:34.360 align:start position:0%
read so um I that I think that's the
 
00:32:35.830 --> 00:32:35.840 align:start position:0%
best we can answer that question at this
 
00:32:37.710 --> 00:32:37.720 align:start position:0%
time okay and then how do members of the
 
00:32:40.149 --> 00:32:40.159 align:start position:0%
public have access to this information
 
00:32:41.629 --> 00:32:41.639 align:start position:0%
and particularly people that are signed
 
00:32:44.990 --> 00:32:45.000 align:start position:0%
up to testify since that's a a related
 
00:32:47.909 --> 00:32:47.919 align:start position:0%
Luna we have had our hearing the public
 
00:32:49.990 --> 00:32:50.000 align:start position:0%
has had the opportunity to register
 
00:32:52.190 --> 00:32:52.200 align:start position:0%

00:32:55.789 --> 00:32:55.799 align:start position:0%

the clerk would have the count from the
 
00:33:16.110 --> 00:33:16.120 align:start position:0%
last meeting um I think the on all our
 
00:33:18.909 --> 00:33:18.919 align:start position:0%

00:33:21.350 --> 00:33:21.360 align:start position:0%

00:34:23.510 --> 00:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
in a different time here and and uh
 
00:34:26.750 --> 00:34:26.760 align:start position:0%
everything we're doing is sort of uh re
 
00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:27.589 align:start position:0%
everything we're doing is sort of uh re
uh

00:34:27.589 --> 00:34:27.599 align:start position:0%

testifying and those signing the blue
 
00:34:40.109 --> 00:34:40.119 align:start position:0%
sheets are in fact the same um and we
 
00:34:43.310 --> 00:34:43.320 align:start position:0%
are now going to be um because of
 
00:34:45.550 --> 00:34:45.560 align:start position:0%
because of how we're doing this um and
 
00:34:47.869 --> 00:34:47.879 align:start position:0%
and the fact that we have had uh so many
 
00:34:49.550 --> 00:34:49.560 align:start position:0%
people continue to sign up during the
 
00:34:51.430 --> 00:34:51.440 align:start position:0%
hearings and that sort of thing we have
 
00:34:53.349 --> 00:34:53.359 align:start position:0%
changed the process such that anybody
 
00:34:56.389 --> 00:34:56.399 align:start position:0%
who is seeking to sign up um needs to do
 
00:34:58.990 --> 00:34:59.000 align:start position:0%
so by 8 o'clock the morning of the
 
00:35:01.950 --> 00:35:01.960 align:start position:0%
hearing um and that is when the chair
 
00:35:05.310 --> 00:35:05.320 align:start position:0%
will get the list for the day that being
 
00:35:07.870 --> 00:35:07.880 align:start position:0%
said just as in a normal setting when we
 
00:35:10.710 --> 00:35:10.720 align:start position:0%
have um uh public hearings and members
 
00:35:12.910 --> 00:35:12.920 align:start position:0%
of the public wish to testify from the
 
00:35:15.870 --> 00:35:15.880 align:start position:0%
audience um the they are allowed to
 
00:35:18.430 --> 00:35:18.440 align:start position:0%
raise their hands from uh the the
 
00:35:22.030 --> 00:35:22.040 align:start position:0%
audience position in this case and um
 
00:35:25.430 --> 00:35:25.440 align:start position:0%
they will be able to uh be called on by
 
00:35:28.550 --> 00:35:28.560 align:start position:0%
the chair in that setting uh the blue
 
00:35:31.510 --> 00:35:31.520 align:start position:0%
sheet practice in the past has has been
 
00:35:33.190 --> 00:35:33.200 align:start position:0%
that usually at the end of the public
 
00:35:36.710 --> 00:35:36.720 align:start position:0%
hearing the chair reads uh the numbers
 
00:35:39.430 --> 00:35:39.440 align:start position:0%
or the the persons who signed in uh
 
00:35:42.390 --> 00:35:42.400 align:start position:0%
stating their positions for the record
 
00:35:45.030 --> 00:35:45.040 align:start position:0%
um in some of those instances we have
 
00:35:48.790 --> 00:35:48.800 align:start position:0%
had um you know many hundreds of people
 
00:35:51.470 --> 00:35:51.480 align:start position:0%
um signing up uh some from as far away
 
00:35:54.670 --> 00:35:54.680 align:start position:0%
as California and the like uh and and
 
00:35:57.069 --> 00:35:57.079 align:start position:0%
registering their opinions and uh they
 
00:35:59.950 --> 00:35:59.960 align:start position:0%
have been reading those numbers uh into
 
00:36:02.870 --> 00:36:02.880 align:start position:0%
into the record um as far as the list
 
00:36:05.710 --> 00:36:05.720 align:start position:0%
being available we are working on how to
 
00:36:08.829 --> 00:36:08.839 align:start position:0%
make that available to the entire public
 
00:36:10.670 --> 00:36:10.680 align:start position:0%
uh the um
 
00:36:13.270 --> 00:36:13.280 align:start position:0%
information is going to be readily
 
00:36:14.710 --> 00:36:14.720 align:start position:0%
available to all members of the
 
00:36:18.550 --> 00:36:18.560 align:start position:0%
committee um the I I do have uh Ju Just
 
00:36:21.069 --> 00:36:21.079 align:start position:0%
on this particular bill I did I was able
 
00:36:24.670 --> 00:36:24.680 align:start position:0%
to uh pull up and and um do a quick
 
00:36:27.069 --> 00:36:27.079 align:start position:0%
tally and again this is very quick uh
 
00:36:28.950 --> 00:36:28.960 align:start position:0%
but it looks like there were about 48
 
00:36:32.109 --> 00:36:32.119 align:start position:0%
opposed and one in favor um of those
 
00:36:35.950 --> 00:36:35.960 align:start position:0%
that that uh did uh register on the bill
 
00:36:38.150 --> 00:36:38.160 align:start position:0%
uh so I did want to just clarify that
 
00:36:39.910 --> 00:36:39.920 align:start position:0%
that we are continuing to work on this
 
00:36:43.190 --> 00:36:43.200 align:start position:0%

00:37:05.870 --> 00:37:05.880 align:start position:0%
now be um asked to call on people from
 
00:37:08.990 --> 00:37:09.000 align:start position:0%
the audience in a regular hearing would
 
00:37:12.710 --> 00:37:12.720 align:start position:0%
that not have been the case I'm just um
 
00:37:14.670 --> 00:37:14.680 align:start position:0%
though representative Hobson to be to be
 
00:37:17.829 --> 00:37:17.839 align:start position:0%
clear in in a normal situation a member
 
00:37:19.710 --> 00:37:19.720 align:start position:0%
from the audience could fill out a pink
 
00:37:21.790 --> 00:37:21.800 align:start position:0%
card and send it up to the committee
 
00:37:24.829 --> 00:37:24.839 align:start position:0%
chair uh and be allowed to participate
 
00:37:28.630 --> 00:37:28.640 align:start position:0%
because um because of the the form uh
 
00:37:31.670 --> 00:37:31.680 align:start position:0%
that we have been using for signups um
 
00:37:36.550 --> 00:37:36.560 align:start position:0%

00:37:38.670 --> 00:37:38.680 align:start position:0%
that's that's been updated it's been
 
00:37:41.230 --> 00:37:41.240 align:start position:0%
changing the order in which uh people
 
00:37:43.390 --> 00:37:43.400 align:start position:0%
are are getting and unfortunately the
 
00:37:45.710 --> 00:37:45.720 align:start position:0%
chair have a the chairs have a static
 
00:37:47.630 --> 00:37:47.640 align:start position:0%
document and so there have been people
 
00:37:49.829 --> 00:37:49.839 align:start position:0%
that have not been called on so in order
 
00:37:53.230 --> 00:37:53.240 align:start position:0%
to make that uh policy more uniform we
 
00:37:55.790 --> 00:37:55.800 align:start position:0%
are asking um that all members who are
 
00:37:58.870 --> 00:37:58.880 align:start position:0%

00:40:44.390 --> 00:40:44.400 align:start position:0%
day and then just one final question if
 
00:40:45.870 --> 00:40:45.880 align:start position:0%
I might Mr
 
00:40:50.270 --> 00:40:50.280 align:start position:0%
chair um thank you Mr clerk um
 
00:40:53.670 --> 00:40:53.680 align:start position:0%
so the blue sheet quote unquote blue
 
00:40:58.430 --> 00:40:58.440 align:start position:0%
sheet from um last week's hearing on HB
 
00:41:02.670 --> 00:41:02.680 align:start position:0%
609 um I believe the numbers were read
 
00:41:05.109 --> 00:41:05.119 align:start position:0%
at the end of the hearing um but is
 
00:41:08.309 --> 00:41:08.319 align:start position:0%
there any way if it's been updated um
 
00:41:09.990 --> 00:41:10.000 align:start position:0%
and allowed you know that it's been open
 
00:41:11.910 --> 00:41:11.920 align:start position:0%
for people to sign in either in support
 
00:41:14.270 --> 00:41:14.280 align:start position:0%
or in opposition to the bill is there
 
00:41:17.190 --> 00:41:17.200 align:start position:0%
any way that we as a committee can check
 
00:41:20.270 --> 00:41:20.280 align:start position:0%
on what that update was um you know what
 
00:41:22.510 --> 00:41:22.520 align:start position:0%
the final tally was before that was
 
00:41:27.069 --> 00:41:27.079 align:start position:0%
closed off um I the the short answer is
 
00:41:29.349 --> 00:41:29.359 align:start position:0%
I don't know uh the answer to that I
 
00:41:31.990 --> 00:41:32.000 align:start position:0%
don't know how many had signed in uh at
 
00:41:34.069 --> 00:41:34.079 align:start position:0%
that time or if people did sign in
 
00:41:37.190 --> 00:41:37.200 align:start position:0%
afterward um so if if if the clerk has
 
00:41:40.829 --> 00:41:40.839 align:start position:0%
the um the number uh in in her record I
 
00:41:44.109 --> 00:41:44.119 align:start position:0%
I I'm not entirely sure thank you thank
 
00:41:48.109 --> 00:41:48.119 align:start position:0%
you very much uh represent LE and Smith
 
00:41:50.309 --> 00:41:50.319 align:start position:0%
and and I'm I I am just seeing I'm sorry
 
00:41:53.270 --> 00:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
that that uh the the chair um has texted
 
00:41:55.270 --> 00:41:55.280 align:start position:0%
me that he has got uh completely
 
00:41:57.230 --> 00:41:57.240 align:start position:0%
different numbers than I do because he
 
00:42:00.829 --> 00:42:00.839 align:start position:0%
he has a he has a much greater form um
 
00:42:04.589 --> 00:42:04.599 align:start position:0%
than I do so uh and I I am just looking
 
00:42:07.990 --> 00:42:08.000 align:start position:0%
um at a snapshot so he he has a much
 
00:42:10.550 --> 00:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
more complete list so again thank you
 
00:42:13.349 --> 00:42:13.359 align:start position:0%
for that Mr chair thank you um I I'm
 
00:42:16.190 --> 00:42:16.200 align:start position:0%
going to try to move on to discussion uh
 
00:42:18.230 --> 00:42:18.240 align:start position:0%
Beyond this particular point I think
 
00:42:20.790 --> 00:42:20.800 align:start position:0%
we've been uh been given a thorough
 
00:42:24.030 --> 00:42:24.040 align:start position:0%
explanation by the house clerk uh we've
 
00:42:25.790 --> 00:42:25.800 align:start position:0%
had opportunity to ask questions of you
 
00:42:28.470 --> 00:42:28.480 align:start position:0%
we're going to move on now are there any
 
00:42:31.190 --> 00:42:31.200 align:start position:0%
other positions from folks who have not
 
00:42:34.710 --> 00:42:34.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:37.390 --> 00:42:37.400 align:start position:0%
discuss then I'm gonna call
 
00:42:40.390 --> 00:42:40.400 align:start position:0%
and yeah I I do I do have a a
 
00:42:43.510 --> 00:42:43.520 align:start position:0%
clarification just on the last point my
 
00:42:45.910 --> 00:42:45.920 align:start position:0%
notes indicated that you read at the end
 
00:42:49.589 --> 00:42:49.599 align:start position:0%
of the session last time that there were
 
00:42:52.990 --> 00:42:53.000 align:start position:0%
20 that supported this POS this bill and
 
00:42:55.510 --> 00:42:55.520 align:start position:0%
400 that were opposed that's what my
 
00:42:58.829 --> 00:42:58.839 align:start position:0%
notes say I I stand to be corrected but
 
00:43:00.750 --> 00:43:00.760 align:start position:0%
that's that's what my notes
 
00:43:03.549 --> 00:43:03.559 align:start position:0%
say I I do not have that information in
 
00:43:06.109 --> 00:43:06.119 align:start position:0%
front of me so that you you presented
 
00:43:10.109 --> 00:43:10.119 align:start position:0%
that so um it'll be part of the the
 
00:43:12.549 --> 00:43:12.559 align:start position:0%
record uh going forward now if there's
 
00:43:15.030 --> 00:43:15.040 align:start position:0%
no other person that has any further
 
00:43:16.829 --> 00:43:16.839 align:start position:0%
discussion on that who has already had
 
00:43:20.270 --> 00:43:20.280 align:start position:0%
an opportunity I'm going to ask that the
 
00:43:24.349 --> 00:43:24.359 align:start position:0%
clerk um move forward with uh
 
00:43:27.230 --> 00:43:27.240 align:start position:0%
identifying the bill and
 
00:43:30.510 --> 00:43:30.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:34.470 --> 00:43:34.480 align:start position:0%
vote this is a vote on a toath I I just
 
00:43:42.870 --> 00:43:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:46.109 --> 00:43:46.119 align:start position:0%
my oh that's we got
 
00:43:46.119 --> 00:43:48.150 align:start position:0%
my oh that's we got
it

00:43:48.150 --> 00:43:48.160 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:43:51.510 --> 00:43:51.520 align:start position:0%
um this has been extremely confusing
 
00:43:52.990 --> 00:43:53.000 align:start position:0%
because I have
 
00:43:58.030 --> 00:43:58.040 align:start position:0%
not uh had a lot of of this information
 
00:44:01.390 --> 00:44:01.400 align:start position:0%
given to me or or anything so what I'm
 
00:44:03.470 --> 00:44:03.480 align:start position:0%
going to do from now on is make sure
 
00:44:06.470 --> 00:44:06.480 align:start position:0%
that I keep a record after the meeting
 
00:44:09.030 --> 00:44:09.040 align:start position:0%
so if this question comes up at
 
00:44:12.390 --> 00:44:12.400 align:start position:0%
executive commit uh I will have whatever
 
00:44:16.349 --> 00:44:16.359 align:start position:0%
the the um the chairman reads I had no
 
00:44:18.390 --> 00:44:18.400 align:start position:0%
idea that this was going to be something
 
00:44:20.910 --> 00:44:20.920 align:start position:0%
that people were going to be asking
 
00:44:24.270 --> 00:44:24.280 align:start position:0%
after executive session so from now on I
 
00:44:26.510 --> 00:44:26.520 align:start position:0%
will have a record um
 
00:44:30.829 --> 00:44:30.839 align:start position:0%
after each U um hearing that we have so
 
00:44:34.750 --> 00:44:34.760 align:start position:0%
that this will be readily available uh
 
00:44:38.750 --> 00:44:38.760 align:start position:0%
for you so so with that thank you uh so
 
00:44:40.030 --> 00:44:40.040 align:start position:0%
we're going to move ahead here with
 
00:44:42.630 --> 00:44:42.640 align:start position:0%

discussion thank you Mr chair uh this
 
00:47:54.430 --> 00:47:54.440 align:start position:0%
bill was brought forth and it appears to
 
00:47:56.109 --> 00:47:56.119 align:start position:0%
mainly represent just one School
 
00:47:59.109 --> 00:47:59.119 align:start position:0%
District that has interest in doing this
 
00:48:02.190 --> 00:48:02.200 align:start position:0%
we heard from the school administrators
 
00:48:03.990 --> 00:48:04.000 align:start position:0%
Association that this is not actually
 
00:48:06.270 --> 00:48:06.280 align:start position:0%
needed that there's already a good
 
00:48:10.190 --> 00:48:10.200 align:start position:0%
market for uh for the superintendent and
 
00:48:12.510 --> 00:48:12.520 align:start position:0%
that this is not actually something that
 
00:48:14.750 --> 00:48:14.760 align:start position:0%
is needed across the state this is
 
00:48:16.630 --> 00:48:16.640 align:start position:0%
something where perhaps with Innovation
 
00:48:19.230 --> 00:48:19.240 align:start position:0%
schools this could be a waiver to allow
 
00:48:21.270 --> 00:48:21.280 align:start position:0%
a super a superintendent to have a
 
00:48:23.950 --> 00:48:23.960 align:start position:0%
waiver from this compulsory uh from the
 
00:48:27.910 --> 00:48:27.920 align:start position:0%
participation in the retirement system I
 
00:48:30.990 --> 00:48:31.000 align:start position:0%
I thank you very much repres made the
 
00:48:34.069 --> 00:48:34.079 align:start position:0%
second any no thank you is there
 
00:48:37.470 --> 00:48:37.480 align:start position:0%
discussion amongst other members of the
 
00:48:40.950 --> 00:48:40.960 align:start position:0%
committee represent L uh thank you Mr
 
00:48:42.510 --> 00:48:42.520 align:start position:0%
chair I would simply note that I would
 
00:48:45.190 --> 00:48:45.200 align:start position:0%
support the uh motion of inexpedient to
 
00:48:47.670 --> 00:48:47.680 align:start position:0%
legislate on this um the uh New
 
00:48:49.030 --> 00:48:49.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire retirement system although it
 
00:48:50.990 --> 00:48:51.000 align:start position:0%
took no position made clear that while
 
00:48:53.789 --> 00:48:53.799 align:start position:0%
an employees contributions can be moved
 
00:48:56.349 --> 00:48:56.359 align:start position:0%
uh the employer's contribution cannot
 
00:48:58.910 --> 00:48:58.920 align:start position:0%
those go into a the broader based State
 
00:49:01.069 --> 00:49:01.079 align:start position:0%
account um and I just don't think that
 
00:49:02.829 --> 00:49:02.839 align:start position:0%
this is uh necessary at this time
 
00:49:04.549 --> 00:49:04.559 align:start position:0%
nothing prevents a school district right
 
00:49:07.230 --> 00:49:07.240 align:start position:0%
now from uh offering to a potential
 
00:49:09.549 --> 00:49:09.559 align:start position:0%
superintendent um not just simply the
 
00:49:12.109 --> 00:49:12.119 align:start position:0%
contribution into the nhrs but um to
 
00:49:13.950 --> 00:49:13.960 align:start position:0%
offer an additional contribution into a
 
00:49:15.950 --> 00:49:15.960 align:start position:0%
private account of the uh potential
 
00:49:18.349 --> 00:49:18.359 align:start position:0%
superintendent's choice so uh I don't
 
00:49:19.910 --> 00:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
find that this is necessary at this
 
00:49:22.710 --> 00:49:22.720 align:start position:0%
point Thank you thank you very much
 
00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:24.190 align:start position:0%
point Thank you thank you very much

briefly the Department of Education at
 
00:52:42.470 --> 00:52:42.480 align:start position:0%
any department they should be the
 
00:52:46.109 --> 00:52:46.119 align:start position:0%
ones to in their budget State what they
 
00:52:49.829 --> 00:52:49.839 align:start position:0%
need money for we should not be telling
 
00:52:52.710 --> 00:52:52.720 align:start position:0%
Department of Ed you have to have
 
00:52:55.670 --> 00:52:55.680 align:start position:0%
a counselor you have to have
 
00:52:58.430 --> 00:52:58.440 align:start position:0%
psychologist you have to have it's for
 
00:53:01.270 --> 00:53:01.280 align:start position:0%
them to decide put in their budget and
 
00:53:04.549 --> 00:53:04.559 align:start position:0%
submit it at the budget I don't think in
 
00:53:06.950 --> 00:53:06.960 align:start position:0%
any Department we should be telling that
 
00:53:09.510 --> 00:53:09.520 align:start position:0%
department how to Michael manage their
 
00:53:11.710 --> 00:53:11.720 align:start position:0%
their Department it should be up
 
00:53:14.430 --> 00:53:14.440 align:start position:0%
to the commissioner of that department
 
00:53:16.990 --> 00:53:17.000 align:start position:0%
or others it should not be our job thank
 
00:53:19.470 --> 00:53:19.480 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much represent like
 
00:53:22.109 --> 00:53:22.119 align:start position:0%
this yes the last time this was up when
 
00:53:24.910 --> 00:53:24.920 align:start position:0%
we did this I voted for it um because I
 
00:53:27.430 --> 00:53:27.440 align:start position:0%
really really like especially the Career
 
00:53:29.549 --> 00:53:29.559 align:start position:0%
and Technical development aspects of
 
00:53:32.789 --> 00:53:32.799 align:start position:0%
that because I know a lot of um school
 
00:53:35.190 --> 00:53:35.200 align:start position:0%
districts and counselors don't actually
 
00:53:37.829 --> 00:53:37.839 align:start position:0%
know what's available however at this
 
00:53:40.549 --> 00:53:40.559 align:start position:0%
time with the fiscal with what's going
 
00:53:42.349 --> 00:53:42.359 align:start position:0%
on in our state in the state budget and
 
00:53:44.109 --> 00:53:44.119 align:start position:0%
whatever I think this is not the time to
 
00:53:45.910 --> 00:53:45.920 align:start position:0%
pass this I think money that we have
 
00:53:49.190 --> 00:53:49.200 align:start position:0%
could be used better elsewhere um not to
 
00:53:51.390 --> 00:53:51.400 align:start position:0%
say that if it comes up again in a in a
 
00:53:55.670 --> 00:53:55.680 align:start position:0%
year and um you know the state doing
 
00:53:58.589 --> 00:53:58.599 align:start position:0%
better our economy is doing well I might
 
00:54:00.349 --> 00:54:00.359 align:start position:0%
change you know I might go back at that
 
00:54:02.710 --> 00:54:02.720 align:start position:0%
point thank you very much further
 
00:54:10.470 --> 00:54:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:13.549 --> 00:54:13.559 align:start position:0%
committee okay I I I'd like to ask I'll
 
00:54:15.390 --> 00:54:15.400 align:start position:0%
recognize representative Cornell I'd
 
00:54:17.430 --> 00:54:17.440 align:start position:0%
like to ask people to you know there's a
 
00:54:18.990 --> 00:54:19.000 align:start position:0%
little place where you can put up your
 
00:54:21.510 --> 00:54:21.520 align:start position:0%
hand by way of technology that will help
 
00:54:23.109 --> 00:54:23.119 align:start position:0%
me on my screen and seeing those that
 
00:54:25.990 --> 00:54:26.000 align:start position:0%
would like to speak thank you
 
00:54:29.349 --> 00:54:29.359 align:start position:0%
Cornell um I am the spons main sponsor
 
00:54:31.829 --> 00:54:31.839 align:start position:0%
of this bill and it was passed last time
 
00:54:36.510 --> 00:54:36.520 align:start position:0%
18 by two and I don't think the needs um
 
00:54:39.109 --> 00:54:39.119 align:start position:0%
described by the bill have gone away in
 
00:54:41.150 --> 00:54:41.160 align:start position:0%
fact I think it's even more important
 
00:54:43.950 --> 00:54:43.960 align:start position:0%
now that school counselors psychologists
 
00:54:46.870 --> 00:54:46.880 align:start position:0%
social workers um career counselors have
 
00:54:49.390 --> 00:54:49.400 align:start position:0%
someone specific in the Department of
 
00:54:51.750 --> 00:54:51.760 align:start position:0%
Education that they know that they can
 
00:54:54.109 --> 00:54:54.119 align:start position:0%
call and get an answer to their
 
00:54:57.430 --> 00:54:57.440 align:start position:0%
questions I think the department now is
 
00:55:00.750 --> 00:55:00.760 align:start position:0%
overburdened with all kinds of um
 
00:55:02.390 --> 00:55:02.400 align:start position:0%
different things and I don't think
 
00:55:06.510 --> 00:55:06.520 align:start position:0%
there's anyone there that has time to
 
00:55:10.230 --> 00:55:10.240 align:start position:0%
specialize in what school counselors um
 
00:55:13.270 --> 00:55:13.280 align:start position:0%
need at this time um this is a position
 
00:55:16.510 --> 00:55:16.520 align:start position:0%
that was previously funded and filled
 
00:55:19.750 --> 00:55:19.760 align:start position:0%
and it's been ba vacant since
 
00:55:22.630 --> 00:55:22.640 align:start position:0%
2018 so it would just be putting back
 
00:55:25.270 --> 00:55:25.280 align:start position:0%
into place what it has previously been
 
00:55:28.470 --> 00:55:28.480 align:start position:0%
there and again I think it's going to be
 
00:55:30.710 --> 00:55:30.720 align:start position:0%
once after what we're going through and
 
00:55:32.510 --> 00:55:32.520 align:start position:0%
what we're going through now this
 
00:55:35.230 --> 00:55:35.240 align:start position:0%
position's going to be needed even more
 
00:55:36.630 --> 00:55:36.640 align:start position:0%
than it was
 
00:55:38.230 --> 00:55:38.240 align:start position:0%
before thank you very much
 
00:55:40.670 --> 00:55:40.680 align:start position:0%
representative Cornell Thank you
 
00:55:43.349 --> 00:55:43.359 align:start position:0%
represent Shaw yes thank you H I
 
00:55:46.349 --> 00:55:46.359 align:start position:0%
couldn't agree more with representative
 
00:55:51.990 --> 00:55:52.000 align:start position:0%
Cornell um I this position has been
 
00:55:56.349 --> 00:55:56.359 align:start position:0%
funded and was eliminated or was Lo
 
00:56:00.270 --> 00:56:00.280 align:start position:0%
overlooked or whatever or drao and at
 
00:56:03.510 --> 00:56:03.520 align:start position:0%
this particular time having worked with
 
00:56:08.109 --> 00:56:08.119 align:start position:0%
uh many kids in the last year or so and
 
00:56:08.119 --> 00:56:09.589 align:start position:0%
uh many kids in the last year or so and
and

00:56:09.589 --> 00:56:09.599 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:56:14.029 --> 00:56:14.039 align:start position:0%
months this the need for counseling and
 
00:56:16.549 --> 00:56:16.559 align:start position:0%
the need for a consistency around the
 
00:56:20.549 --> 00:56:20.559 align:start position:0%
state with counseling is more important
 
00:56:23.870 --> 00:56:23.880 align:start position:0%
than ever and I think this position is
 
00:56:25.950 --> 00:56:25.960 align:start position:0%
worthy of
 
00:56:25.960 --> 00:56:27.069 align:start position:0%
worthy of
of

00:56:27.069 --> 00:56:27.079 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:56:29.870 --> 00:56:29.880 align:start position:0%
appropriation it's worthy of
 
00:56:33.069 --> 00:56:33.079 align:start position:0%
reinstatement and um it it certainly
 
00:56:36.230 --> 00:56:36.240 align:start position:0%
should not be overlooked just because of
 
00:56:39.589 --> 00:56:39.599 align:start position:0%
a budgetary concern and there are many
 
00:56:44.829 --> 00:56:44.839 align:start position:0%
times when we pass bills that are um
 
00:56:50.549 --> 00:56:50.559 align:start position:0%
that put of uh that sort of uh uh or a
 
00:56:55.589 --> 00:56:55.599 align:start position:0%
mandate to uh a department uh we do that
 
00:56:58.390 --> 00:56:58.400 align:start position:0%
many times so that isn't even an
 
00:57:00.589 --> 00:57:00.599 align:start position:0%
argument with me I think this position
 
00:57:04.230 --> 00:57:04.240 align:start position:0%
is highly important and and should we
 
00:57:06.829 --> 00:57:06.839 align:start position:0%
should pass this thank you thank you
 
00:57:10.029 --> 00:57:10.039 align:start position:0%
very much representative sha further
 
00:57:13.710 --> 00:57:13.720 align:start position:0%
discussion represent Miler thank you Mr
 
00:57:16.309 --> 00:57:16.319 align:start position:0%
chair just to underscore what
 
00:57:18.549 --> 00:57:18.559 align:start position:0%
representative Corell and Cornell and
 
00:57:21.069 --> 00:57:21.079 align:start position:0%
Shaw just said but I'd also like to
 
00:57:24.630 --> 00:57:24.640 align:start position:0%
address represent B's comment uh there's
 
00:57:26.670 --> 00:57:26.680 align:start position:0%
a presumption in in his comment is that
 
00:57:28.870 --> 00:57:28.880 align:start position:0%
the uh Department understands what needs
 
00:57:31.069 --> 00:57:31.079 align:start position:0%
to be done out in the field that's not
 
00:57:34.349 --> 00:57:34.359 align:start position:0%
all that's not always the case in this
 
00:57:37.549 --> 00:57:37.559 align:start position:0%
instance this was brought to us by those
 
00:57:41.510 --> 00:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
who are practicing psych counselors and
 
00:57:43.150 --> 00:57:43.160 align:start position:0%
the need for this and I think it's a
 
00:57:45.349 --> 00:57:45.359 align:start position:0%
responsibility of this committee to
 
00:57:47.390 --> 00:57:47.400 align:start position:0%
listen to what the field is saying and
 
00:57:49.870 --> 00:57:49.880 align:start position:0%
to act accordingly when there is a need
 
00:57:51.630 --> 00:57:51.640 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding what the department
 
00:57:53.950 --> 00:57:53.960 align:start position:0%
feels thank you thank you very much
 
00:57:59.230 --> 00:57:59.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:01.789 --> 00:58:01.799 align:start position:0%
repr Woodcock thank you Mr chairman I'll
 
00:58:03.670 --> 00:58:03.680 align:start position:0%
make this uh brief I do agree with
 
00:58:06.750 --> 00:58:06.760 align:start position:0%
representative Shaw as a co-sponsor I I
 
00:58:09.470 --> 00:58:09.480 align:start position:0%
just want to reiterate there is no time
 
00:58:12.230 --> 00:58:12.240 align:start position:0%
more necessary than now look around
 
00:58:14.829 --> 00:58:14.839 align:start position:0%
we're in a covid faculty students
 
00:58:17.349 --> 00:58:17.359 align:start position:0%
families they're all overstressed this
 
00:58:19.190 --> 00:58:19.200 align:start position:0%
is the time we need to have some
 
00:58:21.150 --> 00:58:21.160 align:start position:0%
leadership from the top that's all we're
 
00:58:23.190 --> 00:58:23.200 align:start position:0%
trying to do there's no more important
 
00:58:24.950 --> 00:58:24.960 align:start position:0%
time than right now thank you Mr
 
00:58:27.470 --> 00:58:27.480 align:start position:0%
chairman very much further discussion R
 
00:58:30.750 --> 00:58:30.760 align:start position:0%
Mullen Brett Mullen thank you uh Mr
 
00:58:34.990 --> 00:58:35.000 align:start position:0%
chair uh just to refresh people's
 
00:58:37.950 --> 00:58:37.960 align:start position:0%
memories uh the last time that we dealt
 
00:58:41.789 --> 00:58:41.799 align:start position:0%
with this bill was last session and a as
 
00:58:44.270 --> 00:58:44.280 align:start position:0%
representative Cornell uh mentioned it
 
00:58:47.589 --> 00:58:47.599 align:start position:0%
left us with an 182 ought to pass
 
00:58:50.870 --> 00:58:50.880 align:start position:0%
recommendation when it went to finance I
 
00:58:54.870 --> 00:58:54.880 align:start position:0%
believe uh and I'm correct me if I'm
 
00:58:57.230 --> 00:58:57.240 align:start position:0%
wrong if anyone remembers otherwise but
 
00:58:59.789 --> 00:58:59.799 align:start position:0%
I believe that Finance uh may have made
 
00:59:01.549 --> 00:59:01.559 align:start position:0%
the recommendation to the Department of
 
00:59:03.990 --> 00:59:04.000 align:start position:0%
Education that they go ahead and put
 
00:59:06.630 --> 00:59:06.640 align:start position:0%
this in their budget as representative
 
00:59:06.640 --> 00:59:07.829 align:start position:0%
this in their budget as representative
boam

00:59:07.829 --> 00:59:07.839 align:start position:0%
boam
 
00:59:12.109 --> 00:59:12.119 align:start position:0%
suggested uh so my vote for this bill
 
00:59:16.230 --> 00:59:16.240 align:start position:0%
this morning will be simply that I
 
00:59:19.470 --> 00:59:19.480 align:start position:0%
disagree with the decision uh of the doe
 
00:59:22.069 --> 00:59:22.079 align:start position:0%
not to put this in its budget this time
 
00:59:24.870 --> 00:59:24.880 align:start position:0%
around because I think that we all
 
00:59:27.750 --> 00:59:27.760 align:start position:0%
recognize that social emotional learning
 
00:59:29.829 --> 00:59:29.839 align:start position:0%
and mental health of our students right
 
00:59:32.349 --> 00:59:32.359 align:start position:0%
now during this pandemic time ought to
 
00:59:34.990 --> 00:59:35.000 align:start position:0%
be front and center thank you thank you
 
00:59:38.150 --> 00:59:38.160 align:start position:0%

count guidance counselors have a
 
00:59:53.750 --> 00:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
organization or multiple organizations
 
00:59:56.630 --> 00:59:56.640 align:start position:0%
that they can turn for this type of
 
00:59:59.789 --> 00:59:59.799 align:start position:0%

01:00:02.670 --> 01:00:02.680 align:start position:0%

01:00:08.789 --> 01:00:08.799 align:start position:0%
answer they they do have a an
 
01:00:11.789 --> 01:00:11.799 align:start position:0%
association and it like the LI
 
01:00:14.549 --> 01:00:14.559 align:start position:0%
Librarians often times work with various
 
01:00:16.510 --> 01:00:16.520 align:start position:0%
local associations we have one in the
 
01:00:18.750 --> 01:00:18.760 align:start position:0%
Upper Valley which involves both Vermont
 
01:00:20.990 --> 01:00:21.000 align:start position:0%
and New Hampshire and when Librarians
 
01:00:24.309 --> 01:00:24.319 align:start position:0%
have a issue they especially the public
 
01:00:26.510 --> 01:00:26.520 align:start position:0%
Li Librarians working with schools that
 
01:00:29.549 --> 01:00:29.559 align:start position:0%
issue sometimes is brought up there or
 
01:00:32.190 --> 01:00:32.200 align:start position:0%
people have a a contact number they call
 
01:00:34.430 --> 01:00:34.440 align:start position:0%
to get advice speech pathologists
 
01:00:36.150 --> 01:00:36.160 align:start position:0%
throughout the state oftentimes chat
 
01:00:38.109 --> 01:00:38.119 align:start position:0%
with each other and they also have their
 
01:00:40.670 --> 01:00:40.680 align:start position:0%
National Asher which they can contact
 
01:00:43.190 --> 01:00:43.200 align:start position:0%
there are those associations that are
 
01:00:45.270 --> 01:00:45.280 align:start position:0%
available to help with specific problems
 
01:00:47.990 --> 01:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
and I know they all do that uh folks
 
01:00:50.670 --> 01:00:50.680 align:start position:0%
often times will call Nea for support
 
01:00:53.710 --> 01:00:53.720 align:start position:0%
and and and get support on a particular
 
01:00:54.950 --> 01:00:54.960 align:start position:0%
issue whether it being instruction
 
01:00:57.230 --> 01:00:57.240 align:start position:0%
curriculum or some other aspect of
 
01:01:00.109 --> 01:01:00.119 align:start position:0%
education so that's available I I think
 
01:01:01.549 --> 01:01:01.559 align:start position:0%
what this bill is trying to look at is
 
01:01:03.789 --> 01:01:03.799 align:start position:0%
setting a person like this available on
 
01:01:08.270 --> 01:01:08.280 align:start position:0%
the department level thank you thank you
 
01:01:11.710 --> 01:01:11.720 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chair just to address
 
01:01:16.990 --> 01:01:17.000 align:start position:0%
representative leakes's uh question uh I
 
01:01:19.109 --> 01:01:19.119 align:start position:0%
I was a member of the New Hampshire uh
 
01:01:21.430 --> 01:01:21.440 align:start position:0%
School Counselors Association for many
 
01:01:24.549 --> 01:01:24.559 align:start position:0%
many many years uh they do not have
 
01:01:28.150 --> 01:01:28.160 align:start position:0%
supervisory capacity over any people
 
01:01:31.390 --> 01:01:31.400 align:start position:0%
employed as school counselors in New
 
01:01:35.750 --> 01:01:35.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and uh they certainly would
 
01:01:39.470 --> 01:01:39.480 align:start position:0%
not have uh as much regulatory
 
01:01:42.150 --> 01:01:42.160 align:start position:0%
information as somebody who was working
 
01:01:43.510 --> 01:01:43.520 align:start position:0%

01:01:46.029 --> 01:01:46.039 align:start position:0%
direct supervision of the Department of
 
01:01:47.710 --> 01:01:47.720 align:start position:0%
Education I mean I think what we're
 
01:01:50.430 --> 01:01:50.440 align:start position:0%
looking for in this position is someone
 
01:01:53.430 --> 01:01:53.440 align:start position:0%
who not only knows about School
 
01:01:57.870 --> 01:01:57.880 align:start position:0%
counseling but also sits at the
 
01:02:00.630 --> 01:02:00.640 align:start position:0%

01:02:04.510 --> 01:02:04.520 align:start position:0%

little bit of more time but uh things
 
01:04:15.230 --> 01:04:15.240 align:start position:0%
it's coming down to crunch time here
 
01:04:17.269 --> 01:04:17.279 align:start position:0%
please and I'd like to save our
 
01:04:19.990 --> 01:04:20.000 align:start position:0%
committee assistant uh not having to do
 
01:04:22.870 --> 01:04:22.880 align:start position:0%
all this at the last moment uh going on
 
01:04:26.069 --> 01:04:26.079 align:start position:0%
to the next uh bill which is a there's a
 
01:04:27.789 --> 01:04:27.799 align:start position:0%
financial note but I'm going to take the
 
01:04:32.269 --> 01:04:32.279 align:start position:0%
other bill first HB 214 this is school
 
01:04:36.589 --> 01:04:36.599 align:start position:0%
building Aid uh remember we both had 214
 
01:04:40.670 --> 01:04:40.680 align:start position:0%
and 594 FN School building Aid bills uh
 
01:04:44.029 --> 01:04:44.039 align:start position:0%
the hearing at the same time for both um
 
01:04:48.029 --> 01:04:48.039 align:start position:0%
so what I'd like to do is turn to
 
01:04:51.269 --> 01:04:51.279 align:start position:0%
214 first
 
01:04:54.390 --> 01:04:54.400 align:start position:0%
please M Mr chair point of uh point of
 
01:04:57.150 --> 01:04:57.160 align:start position:0%
clarification here is it your intent to
 
01:05:02.029 --> 01:05:02.039 align:start position:0%
deal with 214 and then 594 subsequent to
 
01:05:03.470 --> 01:05:03.480 align:start position:0%
this since they are both dealing with
 
01:05:06.069 --> 01:05:06.079 align:start position:0%
the same topic what I will do represent
 
01:05:08.230 --> 01:05:08.240 align:start position:0%
Myer is that I'm going to shortly hand
 
01:05:12.430 --> 01:05:12.440 align:start position:0%
that gavel over to um represent
 
01:05:16.950 --> 01:05:16.960 align:start position:0%
cordelli uh and uh I will be we'll be
 
01:05:20.670 --> 01:05:20.680 align:start position:0%
acting separately on both bills but they
 
01:05:24.630 --> 01:05:24.640 align:start position:0%
are both very related yes so um
 
01:05:26.829 --> 01:05:26.839 align:start position:0%
that's how I intend to go through this
 
01:05:29.910 --> 01:05:29.920 align:start position:0%
seeing they are separate bills um and
 
01:05:32.829 --> 01:05:32.839 align:start position:0%
unless there's you know an option to
 
01:05:34.710 --> 01:05:34.720 align:start position:0%
amend them into one bill that Amendment
 
01:05:37.710 --> 01:05:37.720 align:start position:0%
would be brought forward on the bill so
 
01:05:41.230 --> 01:05:41.240 align:start position:0%
so so sure sure intends to deal with 214
 
01:05:44.910 --> 01:05:44.920 align:start position:0%
and then right after that uh
 
01:05:47.990 --> 01:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
594 yes we will have thank you we'll
 
01:05:49.470 --> 01:05:49.480 align:start position:0%
have a motion on
 
01:05:53.349 --> 01:05:53.359 align:start position:0%
214 and then we will go on to um and
 
01:05:55.630 --> 01:05:55.640 align:start position:0%
take action on on that and then go on to
 
01:06:00.390 --> 01:06:00.400 align:start position:0%

this bill be
 
01:06:39.390 --> 01:06:39.400 align:start position:0%
retained retained second second second
 
01:06:41.230 --> 01:06:41.240 align:start position:0%
from uh R
 
01:06:44.870 --> 01:06:44.880 align:start position:0%

01:06:49.470 --> 01:06:49.480 align:start position:0%
maker of the motion yes thank very much
 
01:06:54.789 --> 01:06:54.799 align:start position:0%
um rep uh HB 214 School building a is a
 
01:06:57.190 --> 01:06:57.200 align:start position:0%
bill which is dear dear to my heart we
 
01:06:59.470 --> 01:06:59.480 align:start position:0%
we've had this come forward year after
 
01:07:03.670 --> 01:07:03.680 align:start position:0%
year and when it hits the next committee
 
01:07:06.829 --> 01:07:06.839 align:start position:0%
Finance uh it's always addressed in a a
 
01:07:10.990 --> 01:07:11.000 align:start position:0%
finance perspective uh taking the and
 
01:07:14.470 --> 01:07:14.480 align:start position:0%
paying off the tail which uh for f
 
01:07:19.029 --> 01:07:19.039 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 23 it would be $32 million
 
01:07:22.109 --> 01:07:22.119 align:start position:0%
and then uh looking at what applications
 
01:07:24.670 --> 01:07:24.680 align:start position:0%
we may have for school building a
 
01:07:27.710 --> 01:07:27.720 align:start position:0%
and adding that cost into it so it's
 
01:07:31.150 --> 01:07:31.160 align:start position:0%
never been fully up to the $50 million
 
01:07:33.630 --> 01:07:33.640 align:start position:0%
that this bill speaks to no less than 50
 
01:07:36.589 --> 01:07:36.599 align:start position:0%
million uh last year there were three
 
01:07:38.390 --> 01:07:38.400 align:start position:0%
bills which were added on top of that
 
01:07:39.710 --> 01:07:39.720 align:start position:0%
the year before that we had one
 
01:07:41.430 --> 01:07:41.440 align:start position:0%
emergency bill with
 
01:07:44.349 --> 01:07:44.359 align:start position:0%
inale my recommendation to retain is
 
01:07:48.549 --> 01:07:48.559 align:start position:0%
done simply because uh reality tells me
 
01:07:51.510 --> 01:07:51.520 align:start position:0%
that it's going to be probably uh
 
01:07:54.510 --> 01:07:54.520 align:start position:0%
decimated at the next level in finance
 
01:07:56.549 --> 01:07:56.559 align:start position:0%
that's my own projection it's of course
 
01:07:59.829 --> 01:07:59.839 align:start position:0%
it's not reality uh you know yet but
 
01:08:02.750 --> 01:08:02.760 align:start position:0%
that's what I believe will probably
 
01:08:06.269 --> 01:08:06.279 align:start position:0%
happen uh I therefore see the best
 
01:08:08.589 --> 01:08:08.599 align:start position:0%
opportunity for us to really address the
 
01:08:12.150 --> 01:08:12.160 align:start position:0%
issues that are coming up with um School
 
01:08:15.269 --> 01:08:15.279 align:start position:0%
building Aid is to have a thorough
 
01:08:18.309 --> 01:08:18.319 align:start position:0%
discussion on how we are going to fund
 
01:08:21.149 --> 01:08:21.159 align:start position:0%
School building Aid how much we're going
 
01:08:23.950 --> 01:08:23.960 align:start position:0%
to fund it for and then looking at all
 
01:08:23.960 --> 01:08:25.189 align:start position:0%
to fund it for and then looking at all
statutory

01:08:25.189 --> 01:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
statutory
 
01:08:28.189 --> 01:08:28.199 align:start position:0%
language uh regarding the application
 
01:08:30.829 --> 01:08:30.839 align:start position:0%
process the application process right
 
01:08:33.269 --> 01:08:33.279 align:start position:0%
now is a very convoluted process which
 
01:08:35.189 --> 01:08:35.199 align:start position:0%
deals with the applications coming in
 
01:08:37.630 --> 01:08:37.640 align:start position:0%
with site design plans you have the
 
01:08:39.110 --> 01:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
letter of intent you have the
 
01:08:41.510 --> 01:08:41.520 align:start position:0%
application deadline you have then the
 
01:08:43.630 --> 01:08:43.640 align:start position:0%
deadline in which a recommendation has
 
01:08:45.829 --> 01:08:45.839 align:start position:0%
to be made by the department that
 
01:08:47.229 --> 01:08:47.239 align:start position:0%
recommendation goes forward to the
 
01:08:48.950 --> 01:08:48.960 align:start position:0%
school building authority the school
 
01:08:51.630 --> 01:08:51.640 align:start position:0%
building authority then uh sends their
 
01:08:53.990 --> 01:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
recommendation back to the state Board
 
01:08:56.550 --> 01:08:56.560 align:start position:0%
of Education and that has to be released
 
01:09:01.030 --> 01:09:01.040 align:start position:0%
by January the 15th um to the various
 
01:09:03.229 --> 01:09:03.239 align:start position:0%
publics that are those that put the
 
01:09:06.030 --> 01:09:06.040 align:start position:0%
applications in and so they can then go
 
01:09:09.390 --> 01:09:09.400 align:start position:0%
to town vote it's a process which has uh
 
01:09:12.229 --> 01:09:12.239 align:start position:0%
worked with just three bills here one of
 
01:09:15.510 --> 01:09:15.520 align:start position:0%
those three applications this last year
 
01:09:19.030 --> 01:09:19.040 align:start position:0%
one of those applications was uh did uh
 
01:09:21.829 --> 01:09:21.839 align:start position:0%
um generate a lot of discussion that was
 
01:09:25.709 --> 01:09:25.719 align:start position:0%
the U school building a project to the
 
01:09:27.430 --> 01:09:27.440 align:start position:0%
district which I represent hay
 
01:09:27.440 --> 01:09:29.030 align:start position:0%
district which I represent hay
Woodsville

01:09:29.030 --> 01:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
Woodsville
 
01:09:32.470 --> 01:09:32.480 align:start position:0%
area the the statute that came into
 
01:09:34.510 --> 01:09:34.520 align:start position:0%
conflict was they the part that we're
 
01:09:35.669 --> 01:09:35.679 align:start position:0%
dealing with the school building
 
01:09:38.030 --> 01:09:38.040 align:start position:0%
authority and what the Matrix is what
 
01:09:41.110 --> 01:09:41.120 align:start position:0%
the criteria they're using to assess and
 
01:09:42.870 --> 01:09:42.880 align:start position:0%
determine whether this re this
 
01:09:44.189 --> 01:09:44.199 align:start position:0%
recommendation coming out of the
 
01:09:48.950 --> 01:09:48.960 align:start position:0%
department if is U uh following uh or
 
01:09:50.630 --> 01:09:50.640 align:start position:0%
addressing issues that they have in
 
01:09:53.470 --> 01:09:53.480 align:start position:0%
terms of bonding ability other issues
 
01:09:55.470 --> 01:09:55.480 align:start position:0%
and also the meeting the standards and
 
01:09:57.470 --> 01:09:57.480 align:start position:0%
the criteria which we have set up in
 
01:09:59.709 --> 01:09:59.719 align:start position:0%
statute that must be looked
 
01:10:05.709 --> 01:10:05.719 align:start position:0%
at the the poal for us to uh or the need
 
01:10:07.950 --> 01:10:07.960 align:start position:0%
I should say to really look at this
 
01:10:10.390 --> 01:10:10.400 align:start position:0%
whole process now it's important we need
 
01:10:13.110 --> 01:10:13.120 align:start position:0%
need to address this time frame frame
 
01:10:16.270 --> 01:10:16.280 align:start position:0%
the the application process where our
 
01:10:19.390 --> 01:10:19.400 align:start position:0%
priorities are I I feel this time I
 
01:10:21.990 --> 01:10:22.000 align:start position:0%
we've learned a lot from Co we know that
 
01:10:24.270 --> 01:10:24.280 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of issues many issues
 
01:10:26.229 --> 01:10:26.239 align:start position:0%
dealing with various systems within

01:11:11.790 --> 01:11:11.800 align:start position:0%
school facilities um and other
 
01:11:13.149 --> 01:11:13.159 align:start position:0%
activities that are necessary to
 
01:11:16.149 --> 01:11:16.159 align:start position:0%
maintain the operation of and continuity
 
01:11:18.830 --> 01:11:18.840 align:start position:0%
of services and local education agencies
 
01:11:21.030 --> 01:11:21.040 align:start position:0%
and continue to employ existing staff of
 
01:11:22.550 --> 01:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
the local Education
 
01:11:27.270 --> 01:11:27.280 align:start position:0%
Agency so the monies uh are can be uh
 
01:11:30.390 --> 01:11:30.400 align:start position:0%
supplant various aspects uh of what
 
01:11:33.270 --> 01:11:33.280 align:start position:0%
we're doing um to build a whole new
 
01:11:35.070 --> 01:11:35.080 align:start position:0%
building though that will happen with
 
01:11:37.950 --> 01:11:37.960 align:start position:0%
the eser monies we maybe perhaps some
 
01:11:39.950 --> 01:11:39.960 align:start position:0%
renovation projects could occur when it
 
01:11:43.350 --> 01:11:43.360 align:start position:0%
comes to air systems Etc I feel strongly
 
01:11:48.229 --> 01:11:48.239 align:start position:0%
that there is such a need to relook that
 
01:11:50.629 --> 01:11:50.639 align:start position:0%
it has to be done immediately I was
 
01:11:52.990 --> 01:11:53.000 align:start position:0%
attempted to put in a an amendment to
 
01:11:55.310 --> 01:11:55.320 align:start position:0%
this bill which would establish a
 
01:11:57.590 --> 01:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
committee to look at that made up of
 
01:11:59.030 --> 01:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
Representatives and Senate but that
 
01:12:01.270 --> 01:12:01.280 align:start position:0%
would take until probably the fall to
 
01:12:03.189 --> 01:12:03.199 align:start position:0%
get it going with a short period of time
 
01:12:05.669 --> 01:12:05.679 align:start position:0%
to investigate that I'd rather have a
 
01:12:08.149 --> 01:12:08.159 align:start position:0%
subcommittee put together uh where we
 
01:12:10.790 --> 01:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
can have active membership uh and
 
01:12:13.430 --> 01:12:13.440 align:start position:0%
involve it also with folks from finance
 
01:12:15.990 --> 01:12:16.000 align:start position:0%
and have a report come out from that
 
01:12:17.910 --> 01:12:17.920 align:start position:0%
subcommittee so we can take action in
 
01:12:21.229 --> 01:12:21.239 align:start position:0%
the second year of the vium so that
 
01:12:24.390 --> 01:12:24.400 align:start position:0%
concludes my remarks Mr chair
 
01:12:26.310 --> 01:12:26.320 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair would the
 
01:12:29.790 --> 01:12:29.800 align:start position:0%
um maker of the second uh wish to
 
01:12:33.070 --> 01:12:33.080 align:start position:0%
comment uh thank you Mr chairman I doubt
 
01:12:36.110 --> 01:12:36.120 align:start position:0%
there's any eloquence that I could
 
01:12:41.390 --> 01:12:41.400 align:start position:0%
add uh thank you for your brevity um I
 
01:12:45.470 --> 01:12:45.480 align:start position:0%
see a hand up with representative luno
 
01:12:47.709 --> 01:12:47.719 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair and uh and
 
01:12:50.790 --> 01:12:50.800 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh chairman lad for
 
01:12:54.270 --> 01:12:54.280 align:start position:0%
um for your your very um important
 
01:12:56.830 --> 01:12:56.840 align:start position:0%
remarks surrounding the uh the need for
 
01:12:59.390 --> 01:12:59.400 align:start position:0%
um for building Aid and for um for
 
01:13:01.550 --> 01:13:01.560 align:start position:0%
making uh improvements to the building
 
01:13:04.830 --> 01:13:04.840 align:start position:0%
aid program I think as we um as we saw
 
01:13:07.629 --> 01:13:07.639 align:start position:0%
from uh from director Clark from uh from
 
01:13:11.550 --> 01:13:11.560 align:start position:0%
the Department there's over um uh $200
 
01:13:14.149 --> 01:13:14.159 align:start position:0%
million dollar worth of uh of projects
 
01:13:17.510 --> 01:13:17.520 align:start position:0%
that have uh have uh filed for Grant
 
01:13:19.390 --> 01:13:19.400 align:start position:0%
applications for just the first year of
 
01:13:20.910 --> 01:13:20.920 align:start position:0%
the banum
 
01:13:24.390 --> 01:13:24.400 align:start position:0%
fy22 and um and
 
01:13:27.830 --> 01:13:27.840 align:start position:0%
um in those projects um the uh the
 
01:13:30.430 --> 01:13:30.440 align:start position:0%
building aid grant value is over $
 
01:13:33.030 --> 01:13:33.040 align:start position:0%
hundred million so I think what we're
 
01:13:36.229 --> 01:13:36.239 align:start position:0%
seeing right now and and I think this
 
01:13:38.550 --> 01:13:38.560 align:start position:0%
this you know alludes to um to the
 
01:13:41.790 --> 01:13:41.800 align:start position:0%
chair's remarks is that over the 10-year
 
01:13:44.830 --> 01:13:44.840 align:start position:0%
moratorium period we've seen a uh We've
 
01:13:46.870 --> 01:13:46.880 align:start position:0%
obviously seen a number of projects
 
01:13:48.950 --> 01:13:48.960 align:start position:0%
number of uh school districts go ahead
 
01:13:51.070 --> 01:13:51.080 align:start position:0%
with projects because they couldn't wait
 
01:13:52.870 --> 01:13:52.880 align:start position:0%
but we've also seen a tremendous
 
01:13:55.590 --> 01:13:55.600 align:start position:0%
pipeline develop where uh where projects
 
01:13:57.990 --> 01:13:58.000 align:start position:0%
need to um are are really are really
 
01:14:00.709 --> 01:14:00.719 align:start position:0%
critical and um and you know according
 
01:14:03.830 --> 01:14:03.840 align:start position:0%
to director Clark's uh information that
 
01:14:06.590 --> 01:14:06.600 align:start position:0%
she presented in in the um um very
 
01:14:10.110 --> 01:14:10.120 align:start position:0%
detailed handout these range from from
 
01:14:12.629 --> 01:14:12.639 align:start position:0%
you know classroom projects to air
 
01:14:15.149 --> 01:14:15.159 align:start position:0%
quality to energy to a variety of
 
01:14:18.149 --> 01:14:18.159 align:start position:0%
different um uh different things and I
 
01:14:21.310 --> 01:14:21.320 align:start position:0%
certainly recognize the chair's um
 
01:14:23.629 --> 01:14:23.639 align:start position:0%
intention and I and I believe it it's
 
01:14:26.709 --> 01:14:26.719 align:start position:0%
certainly sincere to uh to to continue
 
01:14:29.870 --> 01:14:29.880 align:start position:0%
to work on this issue and not let um and
 
01:14:33.910 --> 01:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
not let a a good bill a bill that I was
 
01:14:36.430 --> 01:14:36.440 align:start position:0%
certainly willing to to recommend a to
 
01:14:40.590 --> 01:14:40.600 align:start position:0%
pass on um uh get uh get stuck in the
 
01:14:43.910 --> 01:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
finance committee but um but that said
 
01:14:46.709 --> 01:14:46.719 align:start position:0%
you know we we uh we have another bill
 
01:14:48.590 --> 01:14:48.600 align:start position:0%
coming up as well and I know this isn't
 
01:14:50.430 --> 01:14:50.440 align:start position:0%
the exact session on that and I'm not
 
01:14:53.910 --> 01:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
asking for that but um but uh given the
 
01:14:57.310 --> 01:14:57.320 align:start position:0%
uh given the urgency um perhaps the
 
01:15:00.910 --> 01:15:00.920 align:start position:0%
second Bill 594 is something that that
 
01:15:04.350 --> 01:15:04.360 align:start position:0%
this committee might um might uh not
 
01:15:07.709 --> 01:15:07.719 align:start position:0%
mind moving towards finance and letting
 
01:15:11.189 --> 01:15:11.199 align:start position:0%
it uh uh be committed there and uh and
 
01:15:13.830 --> 01:15:13.840 align:start position:0%
it gives the opportunity to uh to sort
 
01:15:16.070 --> 01:15:16.080 align:start position:0%
of have our cake and eat it too number
 
01:15:17.750 --> 01:15:17.760 align:start position:0%
one have a bill that's retain that we
 
01:15:19.790 --> 01:15:19.800 align:start position:0%
can continue to work on and use as a
 
01:15:22.510 --> 01:15:22.520 align:start position:0%
vehicle in um in the the second year of
 
01:15:25.750 --> 01:15:25.760 align:start position:0%
the bium but also stress the importance
 
01:15:28.390 --> 01:15:28.400 align:start position:0%
of the building aid program for uh for
 
01:15:31.950 --> 01:15:31.960 align:start position:0%
districts um uh around the state and um
 
01:15:33.830 --> 01:15:33.840 align:start position:0%
and and the importance of changes to the
 
01:15:35.830 --> 01:15:35.840 align:start position:0%
building aid program to be able to
 
01:15:37.870 --> 01:15:37.880 align:start position:0%
address the hundreds of millions of
 
01:15:40.390 --> 01:15:40.400 align:start position:0%
dollars in Project backlog and be able
 
01:15:43.669 --> 01:15:43.679 align:start position:0%
to do that um within a a financially
 
01:15:46.910 --> 01:15:46.920 align:start position:0%
sustainable and responsible Manner and
 
01:15:50.030 --> 01:15:50.040 align:start position:0%
when we do get to 594 I do intend to
 
01:15:53.310 --> 01:15:53.320 align:start position:0%
offer an amendment that um that that
 
01:15:56.189 --> 01:15:56.199 align:start position:0%
essentially merges 594 with the uh with
 
01:15:58.669 --> 01:15:58.679 align:start position:0%
the changes representative lad put into
 
01:16:01.550 --> 01:16:01.560 align:start position:0%
house bill 214 so it would in fact have
 
01:16:05.149 --> 01:16:05.159 align:start position:0%
the same fiscal um uh uh level the 50
 
01:16:07.189 --> 01:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
million which would include Capital
 
01:16:09.629 --> 01:16:09.639 align:start position:0%
project grants plus the the tail the
 
01:16:12.790 --> 01:16:12.800 align:start position:0%
ongoing tail obligation so so it would
 
01:16:15.709 --> 01:16:15.719 align:start position:0%
it would essentially combine both those
 
01:16:18.350 --> 01:16:18.360 align:start position:0%
those bills so um so anyway I just
 
01:16:20.430 --> 01:16:20.440 align:start position:0%
wanted to put uh put that out there that
 
01:16:22.350 --> 01:16:22.360 align:start position:0%
I think this is a this is a very
 
01:16:24.430 --> 01:16:24.440 align:start position:0%
important both these bills are very
 
01:16:26.669 --> 01:16:26.679 align:start position:0%
important and I think we've got a a good
 
01:16:29.470 --> 01:16:29.480 align:start position:0%
strong opportunity here to um to get
 
01:16:33.390 --> 01:16:33.400 align:start position:0%
something done uh this um this bium uh
 
01:16:36.550 --> 01:16:36.560 align:start position:0%
but also maybe uh uh in this first year
 
01:16:38.510 --> 01:16:38.520 align:start position:0%
of the bium as well so thank you very
 
01:16:42.189 --> 01:16:42.199 align:start position:0%
much Mr chair representative pH thank
 
01:16:43.310 --> 01:16:43.320 align:start position:0%
you Mr
 
01:16:47.229 --> 01:16:47.239 align:start position:0%
chair this is my seventh term here and
 
01:16:50.149 --> 01:16:50.159 align:start position:0%
over in the past it's always been a
 
01:16:52.470 --> 01:16:52.480 align:start position:0%
policy of some kind you have multiple
 
01:16:55.750 --> 01:16:55.760 align:start position:0%
bills on the same subject you try to get
 
01:16:58.990 --> 01:16:59.000 align:start position:0%
together and come up with one bill some
 
01:17:00.750 --> 01:17:00.760 align:start position:0%
years ago it was a homeschooling Bill we
 
01:17:03.270 --> 01:17:03.280 align:start position:0%
had a bunch from them and we retained
 
01:17:06.149 --> 01:17:06.159 align:start position:0%
them and came up with one good bill so
 
01:17:08.470 --> 01:17:08.480 align:start position:0%
the same thing here they're parts of
 
01:17:11.070 --> 01:17:11.080 align:start position:0%
both bills that may be good that may be
 
01:17:12.550 --> 01:17:12.560 align:start position:0%
bad and I
 
01:17:15.950 --> 01:17:15.960 align:start position:0%
think retaining to come up because we
 
01:17:18.270 --> 01:17:18.280 align:start position:0%
don't have time to make a subcommittee
 
01:17:22.149 --> 01:17:22.159 align:start position:0%
now to do it uh is a is a good idea we
 
01:17:24.910 --> 01:17:24.920 align:start position:0%
need to retain it and then come up with
 
01:17:26.950 --> 01:17:26.960 align:start position:0%
something that may get through the
 
01:17:29.350 --> 01:17:29.360 align:start position:0%
second committee and that's one of the
 
01:17:32.950 --> 01:17:32.960 align:start position:0%
issues we have let's you know not waste
 
01:17:36.629 --> 01:17:36.639 align:start position:0%
time pass this and finance is gonna
 
01:17:37.950 --> 01:17:37.960 align:start position:0%
because nothing's going to change
 
01:17:39.510 --> 01:17:39.520 align:start position:0%
they're gonna say we only have X amount
 
01:17:43.030 --> 01:17:43.040 align:start position:0%
of money and that's what we have um
 
01:17:45.950 --> 01:17:45.960 align:start position:0%
so maybe a good idea I know our school
 
01:17:48.070 --> 01:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
district is looking for building ha
 
01:17:50.070 --> 01:17:50.080 align:start position:0%
because I told them you're not on the
 
01:17:53.750 --> 01:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
list and they thought they were but but
 
01:17:57.310 --> 01:17:57.320 align:start position:0%
sort of shock but anyway yeah all lot of
 
01:17:59.030 --> 01:17:59.040 align:start position:0%
school districts need money they need a
 
01:18:00.629 --> 01:18:00.639 align:start position:0%
new school
 
01:18:04.870 --> 01:18:04.880 align:start position:0%
but right now we can't afford the thing
 
01:18:06.950 --> 01:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
and if they didn't mess it up some years
 
01:18:10.030 --> 01:18:10.040 align:start position:0%
ago and bonding the whole issue we
 
01:18:11.470 --> 01:18:11.480 align:start position:0%
probably wouldn't have this problem
 
01:18:14.270 --> 01:18:14.280 align:start position:0%
today so with that thank
 
01:18:17.189 --> 01:18:17.199 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much representative
 
01:18:21.430 --> 01:18:21.440 align:start position:0%
and next repr miles uh thank you Mr
 
01:18:24.430 --> 01:18:24.440 align:start position:0%
chairman um for those members who are
 
01:18:26.990 --> 01:18:27.000 align:start position:0%
new to this committee you need to
 
01:18:29.390 --> 01:18:29.400 align:start position:0%
realize that this issue of building Aid
 
01:18:31.990 --> 01:18:32.000 align:start position:0%
has been around for since I've been in
 
01:18:34.950 --> 01:18:34.960 align:start position:0%
the legislature we've looked at this
 
01:18:37.510 --> 01:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
time and time again the school funding
 
01:18:40.470 --> 01:18:40.480 align:start position:0%
commission looked at this in depth this
 
01:18:42.910 --> 01:18:42.920 align:start position:0%
summer and came up with a very similar
 
01:18:45.550 --> 01:18:45.560 align:start position:0%
recommendation that is in this
 
01:18:49.030 --> 01:18:49.040 align:start position:0%
particular Bill uh I will vote to retain
 
01:18:49.040 --> 01:18:49.870 align:start position:0%
particular Bill uh I will vote to retain
this

01:18:49.870 --> 01:18:49.880 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:18:53.629 --> 01:18:53.639 align:start position:0%
bill but not the next bill
 
01:18:55.950 --> 01:18:55.960 align:start position:0%
because it's my belief that based upon
 
01:18:57.750 --> 01:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
the data that we have received from
 
01:19:00.470 --> 01:19:00.480 align:start position:0%
input from variety of different sources
 
01:19:03.030 --> 01:19:03.040 align:start position:0%
that we cannot continue to kick this can
 
01:19:05.750 --> 01:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
down the road which has been the problem
 
01:19:07.870 --> 01:19:07.880 align:start position:0%
with school funding Aid since I've been
 
01:19:08.830 --> 01:19:08.840 align:start position:0%
in the
 
01:19:12.030 --> 01:19:12.040 align:start position:0%
legislature so notwithstanding uh
 
01:19:14.310 --> 01:19:14.320 align:start position:0%
representative lad's comments because I
 
01:19:16.669 --> 01:19:16.679 align:start position:0%
I understand those comments but we need
 
01:19:18.830 --> 01:19:18.840 align:start position:0%
to move on this bill because we've got
 
01:19:20.350 --> 01:19:20.360 align:start position:0%
we've got school districts out there
 
01:19:23.189 --> 01:19:23.199 align:start position:0%
that are in dire need of this fund and
 
01:19:25.590 --> 01:19:25.600 align:start position:0%
it's time for the state to step up and
 
01:19:27.750 --> 01:19:27.760 align:start position:0%
begin to to look at this so I will
 
01:19:30.350 --> 01:19:30.360 align:start position:0%
retain I will vote to retain this bill
 
01:19:33.310 --> 01:19:33.320 align:start position:0%
but I will not do that in the next bill
 
01:19:36.310 --> 01:19:36.320 align:start position:0%
which I think combines this bill with a
 
01:19:39.229 --> 01:19:39.239 align:start position:0%
much broader look at how the funding can
 
01:19:41.629 --> 01:19:41.639 align:start position:0%
be dispersed uh in the next Bill thank
 
01:19:42.790 --> 01:19:42.800 align:start position:0%
you very
 
01:19:45.110 --> 01:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
much thank you
 
01:19:48.669 --> 01:19:48.679 align:start position:0%
representative um do I see any other
 
01:19:53.990 --> 01:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
comments from the committee have
 
01:19:58.030 --> 01:19:58.040 align:start position:0%

attendee um seeing none uh I thank you

yes thank you very
 
01:21:22.750 --> 01:21:22.760 align:start position:0%
much okay thank you very much folks I'm
 
01:21:25.590 --> 01:21:25.600 align:start position:0%
going to take the gble back here and
 
01:21:31.110 --> 01:21:31.120 align:start position:0%
we're going to move into HB 594
 
01:21:36.709 --> 01:21:36.719 align:start position:0%
FN um and before I take a motion I want
 
01:21:39.870 --> 01:21:39.880 align:start position:0%
to open this up to discussion and during
 
01:21:42.070 --> 01:21:42.080 align:start position:0%
this discussion I will not be taking or
 
01:21:43.950 --> 01:21:43.960 align:start position:0%
accepting motions at this time I'd like
 
01:21:46.550 --> 01:21:46.560 align:start position:0%
to have just an honest open discussion
 
01:21:46.560 --> 01:21:47.510 align:start position:0%
to have just an honest open discussion
on

01:21:47.510 --> 01:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:21:50.470 --> 01:21:50.480 align:start position:0%
594 and I'll explain my reasoning for
 
01:21:52.830 --> 01:21:52.840 align:start position:0%
that I understand that I have not not
 
01:21:54.990 --> 01:21:55.000 align:start position:0%
seen it at this point in time that there
 
01:21:56.990 --> 01:21:57.000 align:start position:0%
is an amendment for that bill it's
 
01:22:00.270 --> 01:22:00.280 align:start position:0%
coming from I believe represent luno uh
 
01:22:02.189 --> 01:22:02.199 align:start position:0%
that it's I would assume it's very
 
01:22:06.430 --> 01:22:06.440 align:start position:0%
similar to what 214 is um okay so that
 
01:22:09.350 --> 01:22:09.360 align:start position:0%
that that's included now there in
 
01:22:14.110 --> 01:22:14.120 align:start position:0%
594 um I have there are certain issues
 
01:22:15.950 --> 01:22:15.960 align:start position:0%
that are associated with
 
01:22:19.149 --> 01:22:19.159 align:start position:0%
594 which I have some concern with and
 
01:22:21.550 --> 01:22:21.560 align:start position:0%
remember we're in that discussion the
 
01:22:24.830 --> 01:22:24.840 align:start position:0%
ultimate goal of 594 is an excellent
 
01:22:27.750 --> 01:22:27.760 align:start position:0%
goal and we need to move forward in
 
01:22:31.070 --> 01:22:31.080 align:start position:0%
something whether it be now or you after
 
01:22:33.550 --> 01:22:33.560 align:start position:0%
we've had an opportunity to do some work
 
01:22:35.229 --> 01:22:35.239 align:start position:0%
I'll tell you the areas which I have
 
01:22:37.070 --> 01:22:37.080 align:start position:0%
concerned with and then we can have the
 
01:22:39.550 --> 01:22:39.560 align:start position:0%
discussion and both sides can get
 
01:22:42.350 --> 01:22:42.360 align:start position:0%
involved with this I on this particular
 
01:22:46.669 --> 01:22:46.679 align:start position:0%
bill it's not really a a one side versus
 
01:22:48.870 --> 01:22:48.880 align:start position:0%
another side it's about schools and
 
01:22:51.870 --> 01:22:51.880 align:start position:0%
school facilities I am concerned with
 
01:22:54.310 --> 01:22:54.320 align:start position:0%
the no no longer having the
 
01:22:58.070 --> 01:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
80% up front for the school district and
 
01:23:00.350 --> 01:23:00.360 align:start position:0%
backlogging some of the cost of that and
 
01:23:02.310 --> 01:23:02.320 align:start position:0%
putting that onto the school districts
 
01:23:05.110 --> 01:23:05.120 align:start position:0%
in terms of uh interest costs they're
 
01:23:06.430 --> 01:23:06.440 align:start position:0%
going to pay seeing that they're going
 
01:23:08.790 --> 01:23:08.800 align:start position:0%
to have to take out some kind of a a tan
 
01:23:11.350 --> 01:23:11.360 align:start position:0%
or something to a bond which is going to
 
01:23:13.110 --> 01:23:13.120 align:start position:0%
pay for what would be coming from the
 
01:23:16.270 --> 01:23:16.280 align:start position:0%
state that the over the period of the 20
 
01:23:18.910 --> 01:23:18.920 align:start position:0%
years that's one concern I have the
 
01:23:21.790 --> 01:23:21.800 align:start position:0%
other concern I have is who actually
 
01:23:21.800 --> 01:23:23.030 align:start position:0%
other concern I have is who actually
approves

01:23:23.030 --> 01:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
approves
 
01:23:26.470 --> 01:23:26.480 align:start position:0%
the uh application that comes in is it
 
01:23:29.030 --> 01:23:29.040 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education I've read
 
01:23:31.070 --> 01:23:31.080 align:start position:0%
the bill where it says the Department of
 
01:23:33.510 --> 01:23:33.520 align:start position:0%
Education shall make the grant but it
 
01:23:35.830 --> 01:23:35.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't say approve what's the Defence
 
01:23:40.189 --> 01:23:40.199 align:start position:0%
of make um is it the state board that
 
01:23:42.149 --> 01:23:42.159 align:start position:0%
approves maybe that's explained
 
01:23:43.709 --> 01:23:43.719 align:start position:0%
somewhere in the bill you know I read it
 
01:23:46.110 --> 01:23:46.120 align:start position:0%
very very late at night so I I could be
 
01:23:49.229 --> 01:23:49.239 align:start position:0%
wrong but that's how I'm seeing it the
 
01:23:51.510 --> 01:23:51.520 align:start position:0%
other issue which I'm seeing is the
 
01:23:54.270 --> 01:23:54.280 align:start position:0%
school building author which we had in
 
01:23:56.910 --> 01:23:56.920 align:start position:0%
the in current uh statutory line which
 
01:23:59.870 --> 01:23:59.880 align:start position:0%
is a check and balance I don't know if
 
01:24:01.510 --> 01:24:01.520 align:start position:0%
that check and balance has really worked
 
01:24:03.709 --> 01:24:03.719 align:start position:0%
the way we intend for it to be but I
 
01:24:06.629 --> 01:24:06.639 align:start position:0%
believe that there needs to be a process
 
01:24:08.390 --> 01:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
which there's a check and balance in
 
01:24:12.149 --> 01:24:12.159 align:start position:0%
terms of making sure that what comes out
 
01:24:16.910 --> 01:24:16.920 align:start position:0%
as a prioritized item out of the um the
 
01:24:20.110 --> 01:24:20.120 align:start position:0%
department is also then in balance with
 
01:24:22.430 --> 01:24:22.440 align:start position:0%
what the people on the school building
 
01:24:23.750 --> 01:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
Authority which are the State Fire
 
01:24:25.709 --> 01:24:25.719 align:start position:0%
Marshal the Department of Education
 
01:24:28.310 --> 01:24:28.320 align:start position:0%
itself uh a number of departments and
 
01:24:30.709 --> 01:24:30.719 align:start position:0%
folks which are qualified to have a good
 
01:24:34.270 --> 01:24:34.280 align:start position:0%
Financial backing background as well so
 
01:24:36.189 --> 01:24:36.199 align:start position:0%
I I'm not so sure we should be dumping
 
01:24:38.030 --> 01:24:38.040 align:start position:0%
something before we have really explored
 
01:24:39.870 --> 01:24:39.880 align:start position:0%
it and discuss
 
01:24:42.790 --> 01:24:42.800 align:start position:0%
that so uh those are several of the
 
01:24:44.750 --> 01:24:44.760 align:start position:0%
concerns I have there other concerns
 
01:24:47.709 --> 01:24:47.719 align:start position:0%
which I do have I do believe that we
 
01:24:49.590 --> 01:24:49.600 align:start position:0%
have to recognize the disparities of
 
01:24:52.189 --> 01:24:52.199 align:start position:0%
school districts in being able to cough
 
01:24:54.470 --> 01:24:54.480 align:start position:0%
up the money for these and it's
 
01:24:57.270 --> 01:24:57.280 align:start position:0%
necessary to maintain some process
 
01:24:59.830 --> 01:24:59.840 align:start position:0%
whether it's 30 to 60 or the 20 to the
 
01:25:02.470 --> 01:25:02.480 align:start position:0%
80 which are I believe in that bill
 
01:25:05.510 --> 01:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
right now um that that's that's
 
01:25:09.390 --> 01:25:09.400 align:start position:0%
important and I can support that um I
 
01:25:11.430 --> 01:25:11.440 align:start position:0%
will I will stop my discussion right now
 
01:25:14.669 --> 01:25:14.679 align:start position:0%
and just opening up for a a a more of a
 
01:25:16.830 --> 01:25:16.840 align:start position:0%
discussion on this I'd like to hear from
 
01:25:20.189 --> 01:25:20.199 align:start position:0%
rep luno his uh kind of perspective on
 
01:25:23.669 --> 01:25:23.679 align:start position:0%
that Amendment and and uh and his angle
 
01:25:25.189 --> 01:25:25.199 align:start position:0%
on some and answering some of the
 
01:25:28.189 --> 01:25:28.199 align:start position:0%
questions I have um so could I could I
 
01:25:30.030 --> 01:25:30.040 align:start position:0%
do that right now Mr
 
01:25:32.910 --> 01:25:32.920 align:start position:0%
chair thanks and and I I have to
 
01:25:34.910 --> 01:25:34.920 align:start position:0%
apologize um I also have a point of
 
01:25:37.149 --> 01:25:37.159 align:start position:0%
personal privilege I have to be in house
 
01:25:39.430 --> 01:25:39.440 align:start position:0%
finance to introduce a bill in four
 
01:25:43.910 --> 01:25:43.920 align:start position:0%
minute in three minutes um so um uh I've
 
01:25:46.830 --> 01:25:46.840 align:start position:0%
I emailed Mel at some uh a couple of
 
01:25:48.390 --> 01:25:48.400 align:start position:0%
points on this but I'm just going to
 
01:25:50.149 --> 01:25:50.159 align:start position:0%
highlight them very quickly I certainly
 
01:25:52.550 --> 01:25:52.560 align:start position:0%
appreciate what uh what chairman lad has
 
01:25:54.629 --> 01:25:54.639 align:start position:0%
been talking about on this the amendment
 
01:25:56.870 --> 01:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
that I that I sent out this morning to
 
01:25:59.390 --> 01:25:59.400 align:start position:0%
all members of the the committee just
 
01:26:04.390 --> 01:26:04.400 align:start position:0%
basically lifts the uh the same um U
 
01:26:07.709 --> 01:26:07.719 align:start position:0%
everything that's in in 214 which is
 
01:26:10.109 --> 01:26:10.119 align:start position:0%
changing the um the recommended
 
01:26:13.750 --> 01:26:13.760 align:start position:0%
appropriation from from no more than $50
 
01:26:17.910 --> 01:26:17.920 align:start position:0%
million to no less than $50 million and
 
01:26:20.270 --> 01:26:20.280 align:start position:0%
that that 50 million that appropriation
 
01:26:22.590 --> 01:26:22.600 align:start position:0%
would also be inclusive of the uh tail
 
01:26:25.430 --> 01:26:25.440 align:start position:0%
obligations so so it it lines up with
 
01:26:28.510 --> 01:26:28.520 align:start position:0%
214 completely the uh the remaining
 
01:26:30.830 --> 01:26:30.840 align:start position:0%
elements that are that are distinct to
 
01:26:33.149 --> 01:26:33.159 align:start position:0%
594 that come out of the commission's
 
01:26:34.550 --> 01:26:34.560 align:start position:0%
work and come out of numerous
 
01:26:36.990 --> 01:26:37.000 align:start position:0%
discussions with director Clark are
 
01:26:39.470 --> 01:26:39.480 align:start position:0%
moving away from 100% upfront to a
 
01:26:42.669 --> 01:26:42.679 align:start position:0%
20-year plan um what that does is frees
 
01:26:45.109 --> 01:26:45.119 align:start position:0%
up the um what what would be what would
 
01:26:47.189 --> 01:26:47.199 align:start position:0%
be in a $50 million appropriation that
 
01:26:49.629 --> 01:26:49.639 align:start position:0%
includes the tail would be in the first
 
01:26:52.910 --> 01:26:52.920 align:start position:0%
year fy22 would be $15 million for
 
01:26:56.189 --> 01:26:56.199 align:start position:0%
capital projects and um and $35 million
 
01:26:58.629 --> 01:26:58.639 align:start position:0%
in tail obligations out of the 15
 
01:27:01.830 --> 01:27:01.840 align:start position:0%
million in capital projects if it were
 
01:27:04.750 --> 01:27:04.760 align:start position:0%
100% you'd only be able to do about um
 
01:27:07.790 --> 01:27:07.800 align:start position:0%
15% of the projects with uh with House
 
01:27:07.800 --> 01:27:08.669 align:start position:0%
15% of the projects with uh with House
Bill

01:27:08.669 --> 01:27:08.679 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
01:27:12.229 --> 01:27:12.239 align:start position:0%
594 um uh it's closer to 100% so you'd
 
01:27:14.709 --> 01:27:14.719 align:start position:0%
be able to drill right down and address
 
01:27:17.229 --> 01:27:17.239 align:start position:0%
that that backlog which I'm looking at
 
01:27:20.310 --> 01:27:20.320 align:start position:0%
is is currently 270 million in projects
 
01:27:24.790 --> 01:27:24.800 align:start position:0%
with a 104 u m dollar uh Grant award so
 
01:27:27.430 --> 01:27:27.440 align:start position:0%
that's the first part the second part is
 
01:27:30.430 --> 01:27:30.440 align:start position:0%
expanding the fiscal uh disparity R the
 
01:27:33.270 --> 01:27:33.280 align:start position:0%
grant range to to align itself better
 
01:27:35.550 --> 01:27:35.560 align:start position:0%
with with fiscal disparities around the
 
01:27:38.390 --> 01:27:38.400 align:start position:0%
state um and then the third part is to
 
01:27:41.109 --> 01:27:41.119 align:start position:0%
introduce projects in the moratorium um
 
01:27:42.550 --> 01:27:42.560 align:start position:0%
and let them apply and they're limited
 
01:27:46.070 --> 01:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
to a 20% Grant but uh anyway I I
 
01:27:48.950 --> 01:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
apologize I have to jump and um and I'm
 
01:27:51.590 --> 01:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
going to I'll certainly be monitoring
 
01:27:54.990 --> 01:27:55.000 align:start position:0%
this so when a vote comes around um um
 
01:27:58.709 --> 01:27:58.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:01.669 --> 01:28:01.679 align:start position:0%
excused later all right thanks me Mel
 
01:28:05.310 --> 01:28:05.320 align:start position:0%
can take any questions he was there all
 
01:28:07.470 --> 01:28:07.480 align:start position:0%
right thanks let's just open this up to
 
01:28:10.350 --> 01:28:10.360 align:start position:0%
the discussion right now where uh we can
 
01:28:11.669 --> 01:28:11.679 align:start position:0%
have various
 
01:28:16.189 --> 01:28:16.199 align:start position:0%
perspectives on on this bill Mr
 
01:28:19.149 --> 01:28:19.159 align:start position:0%
chair yeah I I think just to to
 
01:28:21.790 --> 01:28:21.800 align:start position:0%
reiterate what I was saying earlier uh
 
01:28:23.590 --> 01:28:23.600 align:start position:0%
you know notwithstanding uh what the
 
01:28:26.470 --> 01:28:26.480 align:start position:0%
chair said I mean this is a key issue
 
01:28:29.430 --> 01:28:29.440 align:start position:0%
but I don't I think we need to put this
 
01:28:32.310 --> 01:28:32.320 align:start position:0%
out there because we've got districts
 
01:28:34.229 --> 01:28:34.239 align:start position:0%
that are that are in dire need of some
 
01:28:36.390 --> 01:28:36.400 align:start position:0%
of this money I think representative
 
01:28:40.790 --> 01:28:40.800 align:start position:0%
Luna's um bill here provides a way to
 
01:28:43.229 --> 01:28:43.239 align:start position:0%
share the limited amount of funds that
 
01:28:46.709 --> 01:28:46.719 align:start position:0%
we do have in a much fairer way than
 
01:28:48.350 --> 01:28:48.360 align:start position:0%
what we've done in the
 
01:28:53.109 --> 01:28:53.119 align:start position:0%
past and to and to delay it now is just
 
01:28:54.870 --> 01:28:54.880 align:start position:0%
kicking the can down the road a little
 
01:28:57.470 --> 01:28:57.480 align:start position:0%
bit more and and it seems to me that
 
01:29:00.470 --> 01:29:00.480 align:start position:0%
some of the issues that chairman lad
 
01:29:03.830 --> 01:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
mentioned can be dealt with uh we can
 
01:29:06.470 --> 01:29:06.480 align:start position:0%
deal deal with that in the retain Bill
 
01:29:08.310 --> 01:29:08.320 align:start position:0%
uh but I think we need to put forward
 
01:29:12.030 --> 01:29:12.040 align:start position:0%
this issue uh to the finance committee
 
01:29:14.270 --> 01:29:14.280 align:start position:0%
and really put it on their table to say
 
01:29:16.550 --> 01:29:16.560 align:start position:0%
we need to deal with this we we've heard
 
01:29:20.189 --> 01:29:20.199 align:start position:0%
this argument time and time again and I
 
01:29:21.550 --> 01:29:21.560 align:start position:0%
think Now's the Time we need to move
 
01:29:22.910 --> 01:29:22.920 align:start position:0%
this forward
 
01:29:26.750 --> 01:29:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:26.760 --> 01:29:29.790 align:start position:0%
 
discussion

01:29:29.790 --> 01:29:29.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:32.950 --> 01:29:32.960 align:start position:0%
repres thank you I have a couple of
 
01:29:36.870 --> 01:29:36.880 align:start position:0%
problems with with the bill one is the
 
01:29:40.470 --> 01:29:40.480 align:start position:0%
multiple payments rather than what um
 
01:29:43.390 --> 01:29:43.400 align:start position:0%
previous Bill had the problem why we are
 
01:29:47.229 --> 01:29:47.239 align:start position:0%
here now because the legislature some
 
01:29:49.590 --> 01:29:49.600 align:start position:0%
years ago said hey let's bond all these
 
01:29:51.990 --> 01:29:52.000 align:start position:0%
payments and now we're stuck with you
 
01:29:54.669 --> 01:29:54.679 align:start position:0%
why we don't have a building a problem
 
01:29:58.229 --> 01:29:58.239 align:start position:0%
program we have a problem so I would
 
01:30:01.109 --> 01:30:01.119 align:start position:0%
rather why I don't not this bill it
 
01:30:05.070 --> 01:30:05.080 align:start position:0%
needs to be do what previous Bill had I
 
01:30:08.470 --> 01:30:08.480 align:start position:0%
like that also 20 to
 
01:30:12.830 --> 01:30:12.840 align:start position:0%
80 that's like hey you can if you prove
 
01:30:15.790 --> 01:30:15.800 align:start position:0%
you're poor we'll build you a school no
 
01:30:19.950 --> 01:30:19.960 align:start position:0%
that's not fair it's not fair to at 20%
 
01:30:23.510 --> 01:30:23.520 align:start position:0%
nobody's going to be in a so-called Rich
 
01:30:26.870 --> 01:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
District which they're not for example
 
01:30:30.270 --> 01:30:30.280 align:start position:0%
my town is supposedly a rich town but
 
01:30:32.350 --> 01:30:32.360 align:start position:0%
it's not longer live in the town both
 
01:30:35.229 --> 01:30:35.239 align:start position:0%
parents have to work so that makes the
 
01:30:37.669 --> 01:30:37.679 align:start position:0%
median household income High because
 
01:30:39.229 --> 01:30:39.239 align:start position:0%
both parents
 
01:30:42.350 --> 01:30:42.360 align:start position:0%
work but it's not a rich town it's a
 
01:30:44.669 --> 01:30:44.679 align:start position:0%
properly poor town which is one part of
 
01:30:47.990 --> 01:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
the bill I really like it goes
 
01:30:51.070 --> 01:30:51.080 align:start position:0%
hopeing the adequacy aid formula where
 
01:30:55.149 --> 01:30:55.159 align:start position:0%
you look at the property po but still 20
 
01:30:58.669 --> 01:30:58.679 align:start position:0%
to 80 is no way I i' go with that and
 
01:31:01.149 --> 01:31:01.159 align:start position:0%
also with the multiple payments over 20
 
01:31:03.189 --> 01:31:03.199 align:start position:0%
years that's not going to prevent some
 
01:31:05.270 --> 01:31:05.280 align:start position:0%
future legislator from doing the same
 
01:31:08.109 --> 01:31:08.119 align:start position:0%
thing the legislator did some 10 years
 
01:31:08.119 --> 01:31:09.430 align:start position:0%
thing the legislator did some 10 years
ago

01:31:09.430 --> 01:31:09.440 align:start position:0%
ago
 
01:31:12.910 --> 01:31:12.920 align:start position:0%
of longer than that
 
01:31:16.030 --> 01:31:16.040 align:start position:0%
uh about hey let's just Bond all these
 
01:31:18.390 --> 01:31:18.400 align:start position:0%
payments even though the treasurer said
 
01:31:20.750 --> 01:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
no and everybody else said no and why
 
01:31:23.350 --> 01:31:23.360 align:start position:0%
are we here now that's why I am against
 
01:31:25.629 --> 01:31:25.639 align:start position:0%
the multiple payment thing so I'll put
 
01:31:28.310 --> 01:31:28.320 align:start position:0%
that up thank you thank you very much uh
 
01:31:28.320 --> 01:31:30.229 align:start position:0%
that up thank you thank you very much uh
further

01:31:30.229 --> 01:31:30.239 align:start position:0%
further
 
01:31:32.830 --> 01:31:32.840 align:start position:0%
discussion we have any
 
01:31:35.189 --> 01:31:35.199 align:start position:0%
answer represent
 
01:31:38.950 --> 01:31:38.960 align:start position:0%
likeness yes I do like the um combining
 
01:31:43.470 --> 01:31:43.480 align:start position:0%
the two into into the amendment where
 
01:31:48.590 --> 01:31:48.600 align:start position:0%
saying that on the payments I like that
 
01:31:52.270 --> 01:31:52.280 align:start position:0%
um I I have a lot of problems with the
 
01:31:55.270 --> 01:31:55.280 align:start position:0%
multiple payments as well because it
 
01:31:57.830 --> 01:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
actually puts a lot more cost onto the
 
01:32:00.149 --> 01:32:00.159 align:start position:0%
local school district because of all
 
01:32:02.229 --> 01:32:02.239 align:start position:0%
that interest that otherwise if you paid
 
01:32:04.510 --> 01:32:04.520 align:start position:0%
up front the bond the school district
 
01:32:05.990 --> 01:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
would have to take out would be much
 
01:32:08.109 --> 01:32:08.119 align:start position:0%
smaller and therefore the interest paid
 
01:32:11.709 --> 01:32:11.719 align:start position:0%
would be much smaller and by not paying
 
01:32:14.030 --> 01:32:14.040 align:start position:0%
it up front but by paying it over time
 
01:32:16.149 --> 01:32:16.159 align:start position:0%
and we're only paying on the principal
 
01:32:18.189 --> 01:32:18.199 align:start position:0%
that means all that extra interest is
 
01:32:20.669 --> 01:32:20.679 align:start position:0%
going to be put on the taxpayer and I
 
01:32:22.189 --> 01:32:22.199 align:start position:0%
very much object to
 
01:32:22.199 --> 01:32:24.830 align:start position:0%
very much object to
that

01:32:24.830 --> 01:32:24.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:32:28.709 --> 01:32:28.719 align:start position:0%
um the other thing that I'm concerned
 
01:32:32.550 --> 01:32:32.560 align:start position:0%
about is the whole idea of property rich
 
01:32:34.950 --> 01:32:34.960 align:start position:0%
and property poor being the only
 
01:32:38.310 --> 01:32:38.320 align:start position:0%
criteria that we have and you have towns
 
01:32:40.350 --> 01:32:40.360 align:start position:0%
that are property
 
01:32:44.149 --> 01:32:44.159 align:start position:0%
Poe but
 
01:32:46.790 --> 01:32:46.800 align:start position:0%
um but that's just because of the way
 
01:32:50.149 --> 01:32:50.159 align:start position:0%
their property is assessed versus
 
01:32:53.629 --> 01:32:53.639 align:start position:0%
another town and and I think a much
 
01:32:56.109 --> 01:32:56.119 align:start position:0%
better way to look at it is what is the
 
01:32:58.910 --> 01:32:58.920 align:start position:0%
ability of the people in the town to pay
 
01:33:01.310 --> 01:33:01.320 align:start position:0%
and we can't I know know what how much
 
01:33:05.149 --> 01:33:05.159 align:start position:0%
they make but if we use the um free and
 
01:33:08.109 --> 01:33:08.119 align:start position:0%
reduced lunch criteria that I think is a
 
01:33:11.870 --> 01:33:11.880 align:start position:0%
much better picture of a Town's ability
 
01:33:15.270 --> 01:33:15.280 align:start position:0%
to pay rather than what somebody
 
01:33:18.870 --> 01:33:18.880 align:start position:0%
evaluated the property as and so I would
 
01:33:22.310 --> 01:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
like to see this based on that
 
01:33:26.950 --> 01:33:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:31.830 --> 01:33:31.840 align:start position:0%
ideas okay uh I will trien right here um
 
01:33:35.030 --> 01:33:35.040 align:start position:0%
the current law uses property
 
01:33:37.470 --> 01:33:37.480 align:start position:0%
valuation and it uses medium family
 
01:33:40.229 --> 01:33:40.239 align:start position:0%
income that's the old Cal capacity
 
01:33:43.669 --> 01:33:43.679 align:start position:0%
disparity Aid formula which we've had
 
01:33:47.030 --> 01:33:47.040 align:start position:0%
since since I know since I've been in
 
01:33:49.030 --> 01:33:49.040 align:start position:0%
the house that's back to
 
01:33:52.109 --> 01:33:52.119 align:start position:0%
2008 um so um
 
01:33:54.629 --> 01:33:54.639 align:start position:0%
we we we if we're going to go with some
 
01:33:56.590 --> 01:33:56.600 align:start position:0%
other way of doing it that would
 
01:33:56.600 --> 01:33:57.790 align:start position:0%
other way of doing it that would
definitely

01:33:57.790 --> 01:33:57.800 align:start position:0%
definitely
 
01:34:01.149 --> 01:34:01.159 align:start position:0%
necessitate a further study the the the
 
01:34:04.149 --> 01:34:04.159 align:start position:0%
areas which specifically that I like
 
01:34:07.550 --> 01:34:07.560 align:start position:0%
about this bill it has some changed time
 
01:34:09.590 --> 01:34:09.600 align:start position:0%
or we need to look at the time schedule
 
01:34:12.510 --> 01:34:12.520 align:start position:0%
in which uh intent and and applications
 
01:34:16.189 --> 01:34:16.199 align:start position:0%
come in and moving forward and uh
 
01:34:17.830 --> 01:34:17.840 align:start position:0%
towards final
 
01:34:22.990 --> 01:34:23.000 align:start position:0%
approval uh I am uh concerned as to who
 
01:34:27.149 --> 01:34:27.159 align:start position:0%
does approve and I need that clarified
 
01:34:29.149 --> 01:34:29.159 align:start position:0%
so the only way that I will be able to
 
01:34:31.510 --> 01:34:31.520 align:start position:0%
vote for something like this is if
 
01:34:35.070 --> 01:34:35.080 align:start position:0%
there's changes made to the uh the bill
 
01:34:38.910 --> 01:34:38.920 align:start position:0%
itself I'm also opposed to the multiple
 
01:34:42.510 --> 01:34:42.520 align:start position:0%
payments uh the 80% UPF front was put in
 
01:34:46.550 --> 01:34:46.560 align:start position:0%
place to try and reduce cost uh incurred
 
01:34:50.229 --> 01:34:50.239 align:start position:0%
by the local town or municipality or or
 
01:34:52.189 --> 01:34:52.199 align:start position:0%
or School District
 
01:34:54.550 --> 01:34:54.560 align:start position:0%
and I believe that's worked the whole
 
01:34:56.350 --> 01:34:56.360 align:start position:0%
process hasn't worked well simply
 
01:34:58.070 --> 01:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
because we've never funded
 
01:35:01.870 --> 01:35:01.880 align:start position:0%
it uh so those are my concerns right now
 
01:35:04.709 --> 01:35:04.719 align:start position:0%
unless this thing is is going to be
 
01:35:08.270 --> 01:35:08.280 align:start position:0%
amended further and we deal with it on
 
01:35:11.950 --> 01:35:11.960 align:start position:0%
another day prior to the Pro or the day
 
01:35:14.189 --> 01:35:14.199 align:start position:0%
that has to be out a committee I will
 
01:35:17.270 --> 01:35:17.280 align:start position:0%
have to support uh a similar motion as
 
01:35:19.229 --> 01:35:19.239 align:start position:0%
to what we gave
 
01:35:24.070 --> 01:35:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:27.950 --> 01:35:27.960 align:start position:0%
I see any is any anybody there no I see
 
01:35:29.590 --> 01:35:29.600 align:start position:0%
yes represent cordelli I was just
 
01:35:32.669 --> 01:35:32.679 align:start position:0%
wondering if um from the people who have
 
01:35:35.310 --> 01:35:35.320 align:start position:0%
objections if we could get a list of the
 
01:35:39.709 --> 01:35:39.719 align:start position:0%
two or three items that um are
 
01:35:42.870 --> 01:35:42.880 align:start position:0%
objectionable in the current
 
01:35:46.030 --> 01:35:46.040 align:start position:0%
594 that could be possibly addressed in
 
01:35:50.109 --> 01:35:50.119 align:start position:0%
an amendment um if someone so desires
 
01:35:52.510 --> 01:35:52.520 align:start position:0%
what represented cordelius just said is
 
01:35:55.070 --> 01:35:55.080 align:start position:0%
that if we could identify some of those
 
01:35:57.350 --> 01:35:57.360 align:start position:0%
questions folks have and we we brought
 
01:35:59.070 --> 01:35:59.080 align:start position:0%
some of those out the multiple payments
 
01:36:03.189 --> 01:36:03.199 align:start position:0%
80% up front etc etc uh if we could
 
01:36:05.550 --> 01:36:05.560 align:start position:0%
address some of those things and keep
 
01:36:08.750 --> 01:36:08.760 align:start position:0%
the good stuff and move this thing along
 
01:36:11.189 --> 01:36:11.199 align:start position:0%
and also because we have retained to
 
01:36:13.430 --> 01:36:13.440 align:start position:0%
more we have the opportunity to really
 
01:36:16.669 --> 01:36:16.679 align:start position:0%
get into a discussion but we also from a
 
01:36:20.870 --> 01:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
policy perspective convey Our concern
 
01:36:23.070 --> 01:36:23.080 align:start position:0%
that School building 8 needs to be
 
01:36:25.109 --> 01:36:25.119 align:start position:0%
looked at and we need to start funding
 
01:36:27.350 --> 01:36:27.360 align:start position:0%
it we have too many old buildings
 
01:36:30.950 --> 01:36:30.960 align:start position:0%
remember the figures we have 50% of our
 
01:36:33.950 --> 01:36:33.960 align:start position:0%
buildings they're well over 60 years old
 
01:36:37.030 --> 01:36:37.040 align:start position:0%
some have been renovated but we do know
 
01:36:38.709 --> 01:36:38.719 align:start position:0%
that there's a lot of issues within
 
01:36:41.790 --> 01:36:41.800 align:start position:0%
those older buildings that need support
 
01:36:45.189 --> 01:36:45.199 align:start position:0%
so uh F the comments and then we're
 
01:36:46.790 --> 01:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
going to have to take some one way the
 
01:36:50.270 --> 01:36:50.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:50.280 --> 01:36:52.910 align:start position:0%
 
this

01:36:52.910 --> 01:36:52.920 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:36:55.550 --> 01:36:55.560 align:start position:0%
rep rep like yeah I have a question
 
01:36:56.669 --> 01:36:56.679 align:start position:0%
about what you
 
01:37:01.229 --> 01:37:01.239 align:start position:0%
just so what will we do just not p on
 
01:37:05.390 --> 01:37:05.400 align:start position:0%
this bill today and put come up with an
 
01:37:08.109 --> 01:37:08.119 align:start position:0%
amendment and then come back like the
 
01:37:12.189 --> 01:37:12.199 align:start position:0%
next like Tuesday and um look at the
 
01:37:14.790 --> 01:37:14.800 align:start position:0%
amendment or I mean what what is the
 
01:37:17.790 --> 01:37:17.800 align:start position:0%
process your that would be the only
 
01:37:20.030 --> 01:37:20.040 align:start position:0%
process which would be available is that
 
01:37:22.629 --> 01:37:22.639 align:start position:0%
that those that have those those
 
01:37:25.750 --> 01:37:25.760 align:start position:0%
questions I receive those questions then
 
01:37:28.990 --> 01:37:29.000 align:start position:0%
I'd be glad to work with the the prime
 
01:37:32.189 --> 01:37:32.199 align:start position:0%
sponsor of this bill and and the work to
 
01:37:34.550 --> 01:37:34.560 align:start position:0%
try you know there'd have to be
 
01:37:36.709 --> 01:37:36.719 align:start position:0%
compromises and uh but we'd have
 
01:37:38.350 --> 01:37:38.360 align:start position:0%
something move forward and it be more
 
01:37:42.350 --> 01:37:42.360 align:start position:0%
than 214 was alone uh if we can't get
 
01:37:44.229 --> 01:37:44.239 align:start position:0%
there then we would have to go for
 
01:37:47.470 --> 01:37:47.480 align:start position:0%
forward uh when we meet again the next
 
01:37:50.310 --> 01:37:50.320 align:start position:0%
week we would probably see a motion for
 
01:37:50.320 --> 01:37:51.750 align:start position:0%
week we would probably see a motion for
retention

01:37:51.750 --> 01:37:51.760 align:start position:0%
retention
 
01:37:54.550 --> 01:37:54.560 align:start position:0%
and there after we saw a 214 there's
 
01:37:56.510 --> 01:37:56.520 align:start position:0%
probably a strong possibility we see
 
01:37:58.669 --> 01:37:58.679 align:start position:0%
retention so the best option I see here
 
01:38:01.750 --> 01:38:01.760 align:start position:0%
as far as the try and and present an
 
01:38:04.589 --> 01:38:04.599 align:start position:0%
amendment to 594 uh reflecting those
 
01:38:06.990 --> 01:38:07.000 align:start position:0%
concerns that have been spoken
 
01:38:09.310 --> 01:38:09.320 align:start position:0%
to represent
 
01:38:12.229 --> 01:38:12.239 align:start position:0%
Miler are you suggesting then uh Mr
 
01:38:14.589 --> 01:38:14.599 align:start position:0%
chair that we set this aside until next
 
01:38:17.910 --> 01:38:17.920 align:start position:0%
week yes so there'll be no motion at
 
01:38:19.790 --> 01:38:19.800 align:start position:0%
this point in time on this bill that's
 
01:38:22.229 --> 01:38:22.239 align:start position:0%
why I started the discussion in
 
01:38:26.669 --> 01:38:26.679 align:start position:0%
right yeah but it would be put aside to
 
01:38:28.750 --> 01:38:28.760 align:start position:0%
be exact next
 
01:38:32.189 --> 01:38:32.199 align:start position:0%
week certainly have to work with others
 
01:38:35.109 --> 01:38:35.119 align:start position:0%
to try and figure out okay uh can we can
 
01:38:37.430 --> 01:38:37.440 align:start position:0%
we get this thing done I think we
 
01:38:41.830 --> 01:38:41.840 align:start position:0%
can but uh I hope we can because all the
 
01:38:43.390 --> 01:38:43.400 align:start position:0%
stuff that I read during the hearing
 
01:38:45.669 --> 01:38:45.679 align:start position:0%
regarding how this affects achievement
 
01:38:48.070 --> 01:38:48.080 align:start position:0%
and health of students is important and
 
01:38:50.030 --> 01:38:50.040 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't we from a poliy perspective
 
01:38:53.149 --> 01:38:53.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:54.709 --> 01:38:54.719 align:start position:0%
I would I would support just setting
 
01:38:56.430 --> 01:38:56.440 align:start position:0%
this aside till next week and work on it
 
01:38:59.070 --> 01:38:59.080 align:start position:0%
in the meantime okay as the ranking uh
 
01:39:00.790 --> 01:39:00.800 align:start position:0%
representative on the other side and
 
01:39:02.149 --> 01:39:02.159 align:start position:0%
you're hearing the chair right here
 
01:39:04.350 --> 01:39:04.360 align:start position:0%
agreed we are not going to be further
 
01:39:08.270 --> 01:39:08.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:13.229 --> 01:39:13.239 align:start position:0%

cordelli has made that motion second by
represent

01:52:26.069 --> 01:52:26.079 align:start position:0%
represent
 
01:52:29.069 --> 01:52:29.079 align:start position:0%
L represent cordelli could you please
 
01:52:32.149 --> 01:52:32.159 align:start position:0%
explain yes or discuss your amended
 
01:52:33.629 --> 01:52:33.639 align:start position:0%
Amendment please we're dealing with the
 
01:52:36.310 --> 01:52:36.320 align:start position:0%
amendment uh thank you very much Mr
 
01:52:36.320 --> 01:52:37.830 align:start position:0%
amendment uh thank you very much Mr
chairman

01:52:37.830 --> 01:52:37.840 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:52:42.750 --> 01:52:42.760 align:start position:0%
um this is a pretty simple um current
 
01:52:47.950 --> 01:52:47.960 align:start position:0%
law provides um as you see in 193
 
01:52:53.030 --> 01:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
C12 Roman 2 the department um uh may
 
01:52:56.109 --> 01:52:56.119 align:start position:0%
send out assessment results uh to
 
01:52:59.430 --> 01:52:59.440 align:start position:0%
parents uh the issue has been and need
 
01:53:02.830 --> 01:53:02.840 align:start position:0%
for this legislation uh is because there
 
01:53:06.390 --> 01:53:06.400 align:start position:0%
are um a few districts who are not
 
01:53:09.589 --> 01:53:09.599 align:start position:0%
sending out this information in a timely
 
01:53:14.750 --> 01:53:14.760 align:start position:0%
fashion which uh actually um violates uh
 
01:53:19.390 --> 01:53:19.400 align:start position:0%
federal law and uh could jeopardize um
 
01:53:22.149 --> 01:53:22.159 align:start position:0%
Federal payments uh to those
 
01:53:25.669 --> 01:53:25.679 align:start position:0%
districts so in this uh Amendment I've
 
01:53:29.950 --> 01:53:29.960 align:start position:0%
simply added the ability uh for the
 
01:53:34.830 --> 01:53:34.840 align:start position:0%
testing entity itself uh to provide uh
 
01:53:38.790 --> 01:53:38.800 align:start position:0%
the uh assessment information and uh
 
01:53:43.229 --> 01:53:43.239 align:start position:0%
related data uh to uh the families um
 
01:53:46.870 --> 01:53:46.880 align:start position:0%
relieving uh districts of that uh I
 
01:53:50.390 --> 01:53:50.400 align:start position:0%
added enrollment three uh language from
 
01:53:52.149 --> 01:53:52.159 align:start position:0%
uh the other Bill
 
01:53:55.310 --> 01:53:55.320 align:start position:0%
323 uh that is also consistent with a
 
01:53:58.510 --> 01:53:58.520 align:start position:0%
federal law that the report that is
 
01:54:02.270 --> 01:54:02.280 align:start position:0%
provided to parents uh should be in a um
 
01:54:06.350 --> 01:54:06.360 align:start position:0%
informative manner uh easily
 
01:54:08.870 --> 01:54:08.880 align:start position:0%
understandable by the parents uh so that
 
01:54:12.350 --> 01:54:12.360 align:start position:0%
they can uh help uh their children um
 
01:54:15.910 --> 01:54:15.920 align:start position:0%
with the standards and uh uh learning uh
 
01:54:18.390 --> 01:54:18.400 align:start position:0%
that would go along based on the
 
01:54:20.750 --> 01:54:20.760 align:start position:0%
assessment results
 
01:54:24.270 --> 01:54:24.280 align:start position:0%
um so that's really all there is to the
 
01:54:26.910 --> 01:54:26.920 align:start position:0%
uh Amendment which basically replaces
 
01:54:26.920 --> 01:54:27.709 align:start position:0%
uh Amendment which basically replaces
the

01:54:27.709 --> 01:54:27.719 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:54:30.430 --> 01:54:30.440 align:start position:0%
Bill thank thank you very much re

Mr chair representative M did you have a
 
01:54:42.229 --> 01:54:42.239 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair uh so
 
01:54:44.790 --> 01:54:44.800 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli this uh takes
 
01:54:49.910 --> 01:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
out the uh class B felony issue wording
 
01:54:52.069 --> 01:54:52.079 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question um
 
01:54:54.149 --> 01:54:54.159 align:start position:0%
actually I I went back and double
 
01:54:58.069 --> 01:54:58.079 align:start position:0%
checked and that is already in statute
 
01:55:02.709 --> 01:55:02.719 align:start position:0%
um if the uh if there is a uh release of
 
01:55:05.910 --> 01:55:05.920 align:start position:0%
that confidential information by anyone
 
01:55:08.870 --> 01:55:08.880 align:start position:0%
uh intentionally in the department um
 
01:55:11.669 --> 01:55:11.679 align:start position:0%
but that is current law thank
 
01:55:14.990 --> 01:55:15.000 align:start position:0%
you further discussion representative
 
01:55:18.149 --> 01:55:18.159 align:start position:0%
elas yeah um just to follow up on
 
01:55:20.270 --> 01:55:20.280 align:start position:0%
representative moffets
 
01:55:23.189 --> 01:55:23.199 align:start position:0%
um representative cordelli you said um
 
01:55:25.069 --> 01:55:25.079 align:start position:0%
that's already if the department
 
01:55:27.229 --> 01:55:27.239 align:start position:0%
releases it is there anything in there
 
01:55:30.030 --> 01:55:30.040 align:start position:0%
that talks about if the testing entity
 
01:55:30.040 --> 01:55:31.510 align:start position:0%
that talks about if the testing entity
releases

01:55:31.510 --> 01:55:31.520 align:start position:0%
releases
 
01:55:34.750 --> 01:55:34.760 align:start position:0%
it I I believe uh I believe that there
 
01:55:39.069 --> 01:55:39.079 align:start position:0%
is the um uh existing statute um
 
01:55:43.149 --> 01:55:43.159 align:start position:0%
restricts the T testing agency into uh
 
01:55:46.109 --> 01:55:46.119 align:start position:0%
the fact that they can only release
 
01:55:49.669 --> 01:55:49.679 align:start position:0%
information um in relation to uh
 
01:55:52.709 --> 01:55:52.719 align:start position:0%
validating uh someone's uh taking of the
 
01:55:55.790 --> 01:55:55.800 align:start position:0%
test that's the only allowable use of
 
01:55:58.629 --> 01:55:58.639 align:start position:0%

okay yes yeah I can hear you can you

01:56:58.669 --> 01:56:58.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:04.709 --> 01:57:04.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:07.189 --> 01:57:07.199 align:start position:0%
hear okay
 
01:57:11.310 --> 01:57:11.320 align:start position:0%
okay so so we we we've dealt with this
 
01:57:13.910 --> 01:57:13.920 align:start position:0%
last time and time before we asked
 
01:57:17.990 --> 01:57:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:20.430 --> 01:57:20.440 align:start position:0%
information should TR
 
01:57:22.990 --> 01:57:23.000 align:start position:0%
yeah should turn his video off do you
 
01:57:27.109 --> 01:57:27.119 align:start position:0%
have your video on he
 
01:57:35.270 --> 01:57:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:41.229 --> 01:57:41.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:44.589 --> 01:57:44.599 align:start position:0%
now he's muted here okay can you hear me
 
01:57:48.069 --> 01:57:48.079 align:start position:0%
now yes yes yes okay all right the
 
01:57:50.430 --> 01:57:50.440 align:start position:0%
Dilemma that we had here is that we have
 
01:57:53.030 --> 01:57:53.040 align:start position:0%
asked the Department of Education on
 
01:57:57.189 --> 01:57:57.199 align:start position:0%
several occasions to give us a a list a
 
01:57:59.669 --> 01:57:59.679 align:start position:0%
number of the of school districts that
 
01:58:00.709 --> 01:58:00.719 align:start position:0%
are not
 
01:58:03.910 --> 01:58:03.920 align:start position:0%
complying you know and we don't get that
 
01:58:05.750 --> 01:58:05.760 align:start position:0%
we just hear oh they're not sending them
 
01:58:07.790 --> 01:58:07.800 align:start position:0%
out without any
 
01:58:10.149 --> 01:58:10.159 align:start position:0%
specifics and so that's one concern I
 
01:58:12.229 --> 01:58:12.239 align:start position:0%
guess that we have with this the other
 
01:58:13.470 --> 01:58:13.480 align:start position:0%
concern is
 
01:58:15.589 --> 01:58:15.599 align:start position:0%
confidentiality we have spent a lot of
 
01:58:19.990 --> 01:58:20.000 align:start position:0%
time in this um in this committee to
 
01:58:22.629 --> 01:58:22.639 align:start position:0%
ensure that student information parent
 
01:58:25.189 --> 01:58:25.199 align:start position:0%
information Etc is
 
01:58:27.950 --> 01:58:27.960 align:start position:0%
confidential this is opening that wide o
 
01:58:31.189 --> 01:58:31.199 align:start position:0%
wide open and thirdly we've heard from
 
01:58:34.229 --> 01:58:34.239 align:start position:0%
school districts that say how they use
 
01:58:35.910 --> 01:58:35.920 align:start position:0%
the report of this
 
01:58:38.189 --> 01:58:38.199 align:start position:0%
information and they use this from a
 
01:58:40.830 --> 01:58:40.840 align:start position:0%
diagnostic standpoint so that they can
 
01:58:42.589 --> 01:58:42.599 align:start position:0%
meet with parents they can talk with
 
01:58:44.629 --> 01:58:44.639 align:start position:0%
parents about the meaning of the results
 
01:58:46.390 --> 01:58:46.400 align:start position:0%
for their for their students for their
 
01:58:49.310 --> 01:58:49.320 align:start position:0%
children and this would abgate that by
 
01:58:51.149 --> 01:58:51.159 align:start position:0%
by having a massive send out from a
 
01:58:51.159 --> 01:58:52.189 align:start position:0%
by having a massive send out from a
central

01:58:52.189 --> 01:58:52.199 align:start position:0%
central
 
01:58:54.790 --> 01:58:54.800 align:start position:0%
location so I think this is a
 
01:58:58.229 --> 01:58:58.239 align:start position:0%
misuse of the problem when there is no
 
01:59:01.189 --> 01:59:01.199 align:start position:0%
problem or at least we have not been
 
01:59:05.270 --> 01:59:05.280 align:start position:0%
told the specifics of the problem so I
 
01:59:09.750 --> 01:59:09.760 align:start position:0%
would hardly uh encourage the committee
 
01:59:11.990 --> 01:59:12.000 align:start position:0%
not to pass this because I don't think
 
01:59:15.550 --> 01:59:15.560 align:start position:0%
it's necessary and it again jeopardizes
 
01:59:17.390 --> 01:59:17.400 align:start position:0%
the relationship that a local school
 
01:59:20.149 --> 01:59:20.159 align:start position:0%
district has with parents
 
01:59:22.990 --> 01:59:23.000 align:start position:0%
as relating to diagnostic work etc and
 
01:59:25.750 --> 01:59:25.760 align:start position:0%
finally we also heard that in some
 
01:59:27.550 --> 01:59:27.560 align:start position:0%
school districts they don't get this
 
01:59:29.709 --> 01:59:29.719 align:start position:0%
information until late in the school
 
01:59:32.550 --> 01:59:32.560 align:start position:0%
year anyway and so the dec the January
 
01:59:37.229 --> 01:59:37.239 align:start position:0%
the June 30th date is a problem thank
 
01:59:39.830 --> 01:59:39.840 align:start position:0%
you further further discussion from the
 
01:59:43.510 --> 01:59:43.520 align:start position:0%
committee rep Cornell rep representative
 
01:59:46.430 --> 01:59:46.440 align:start position:0%
Cornell um R Miler said much of what I
 
01:59:48.470 --> 01:59:48.480 align:start position:0%
was going to say but I also wanted to
 
01:59:51.149 --> 01:59:51.159 align:start position:0%
add that this adds much more work for
 
01:59:54.589 --> 01:59:54.599 align:start position:0%
the Department um to to do when they're
 
01:59:57.470 --> 01:59:57.480 align:start position:0%
already overburdened and don't have
 
02:00:00.270 --> 02:00:00.280 align:start position:0%
enough time to do the things that we've
 
02:00:03.069 --> 02:00:03.079 align:start position:0%
already asked them uh to do and I was
 
02:00:04.910 --> 02:00:04.920 align:start position:0%
wondering should there be a fiscal note
 
02:00:06.790 --> 02:00:06.800 align:start position:0%
with this because if it's going to be
 
02:00:09.510 --> 02:00:09.520 align:start position:0%
mailed out from the Department to every
 
02:00:12.430 --> 02:00:12.440 align:start position:0%
student's family who's taken the test
 
02:00:14.350 --> 02:00:14.360 align:start position:0%
that would be a lot of money wouldn't it
 
02:00:17.109 --> 02:00:17.119 align:start position:0%
and I I may have missed that but it
 
02:00:19.189 --> 02:00:19.199 align:start position:0%
seems like that that would be quite a
 
02:00:21.149 --> 02:00:21.159 align:start position:0%
bit of money and would require a fiscal
 
02:00:24.430 --> 02:00:24.440 align:start position:0%
note in addition to adding more work for
 
02:00:26.589 --> 02:00:26.599 align:start position:0%
the poor Department that we asked to do
 
02:00:28.990 --> 02:00:29.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of other things uh represent
 
02:00:31.030 --> 02:00:31.040 align:start position:0%
Corell I'm gonna ask representative uh
 
02:00:33.149 --> 02:00:33.159 align:start position:0%
cordelli to respond it's my
 
02:00:35.870 --> 02:00:35.880 align:start position:0%
understanding that this is mailed out uh
 
02:00:38.870 --> 02:00:38.880 align:start position:0%
by the testing agency not the department
 
02:00:42.030 --> 02:00:42.040 align:start position:0%
and the testing agencies have offered
 
02:00:44.189 --> 02:00:44.199 align:start position:0%
they they do this in many many states at
 
02:00:46.310 --> 02:00:46.320 align:start position:0%
no extra cost they just want our
 
02:00:48.430 --> 02:00:48.440 align:start position:0%
business so that's something that's been
 
02:00:50.149 --> 02:00:50.159 align:start position:0%
afforded to us but we haven't been able
 
02:00:52.149 --> 02:00:52.159 align:start position:0%
to do it because of our statutory
 
02:00:54.149 --> 02:00:54.159 align:start position:0%
language representative cordelli thank
 
02:00:55.790 --> 02:00:55.800 align:start position:0%
you um the
 
02:00:59.870 --> 02:00:59.880 align:start position:0%
existing statute 193 C12 says that the
 
02:01:01.790 --> 02:01:01.800 align:start position:0%
department May provide the assessment
 
02:01:04.350 --> 02:01:04.360 align:start position:0%
results and data to the parent which I
 
02:01:06.629 --> 02:01:06.639 align:start position:0%
think goes to your point representative
 
02:01:08.470 --> 02:01:08.480 align:start position:0%
Cornell about the expense for the
 
02:01:11.109 --> 02:01:11.119 align:start position:0%
department but that is the existing
 
02:01:14.950 --> 02:01:14.960 align:start position:0%
statute this adds the option for the
 
02:01:19.189 --> 02:01:19.199 align:start position:0%
testing entity um to uh provide that
 
02:01:21.830 --> 02:01:21.840 align:start position:0%
information at no additional burden to
 
02:01:26.229 --> 02:01:26.239 align:start position:0%
the department or cost uh to the
 
02:01:31.669 --> 02:01:31.679 align:start position:0%
state follow up yes so we'd be releasing
 
02:01:34.149 --> 02:01:34.159 align:start position:0%
every student who's taken the test
 
02:01:36.550 --> 02:01:36.560 align:start position:0%
address um and information to the
 
02:01:38.870 --> 02:01:38.880 align:start position:0%
testing entity and what happens if they
 
02:01:41.510 --> 02:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
go to me the they take the test and the
 
02:01:45.030 --> 02:01:45.040 align:start position:0%
student moves soon after taking the test
 
02:01:48.550 --> 02:01:48.560 align:start position:0%
how will they even know that Celli thank
 
02:01:52.229 --> 02:01:52.239 align:start position:0%
you um several things I believe that an
 
02:01:54.189 --> 02:01:54.199 align:start position:0%
existing statute now based on
 
02:01:55.950 --> 02:01:55.960 align:start position:0%
legislation that was passed in the last
 
02:01:59.350 --> 02:01:59.360 align:start position:0%
term uh some of that assessment data is
 
02:02:02.750 --> 02:02:02.760 align:start position:0%
maintained by the department u in the uh
 
02:02:06.550 --> 02:02:06.560 align:start position:0%
student uh data system so the department
 
02:02:08.750 --> 02:02:08.760 align:start position:0%
will have that information if student
 
02:02:12.750 --> 02:02:12.760 align:start position:0%
moves or anything uh
 
02:02:15.550 --> 02:02:15.560 align:start position:0%
likewise we have further questions three
 
02:02:19.109 --> 02:02:19.119 align:start position:0%
hands uh ref Andrews and then Mullen and
 
02:02:19.119 --> 02:02:19.830 align:start position:0%
hands uh ref Andrews and then Mullen and
then

02:02:19.830 --> 02:02:19.840 align:start position:0%
then
 
02:02:24.750 --> 02:02:24.760 align:start position:0%
my repr Andre Thank you Mr chair I'm in
 
02:02:27.470 --> 02:02:27.480 align:start position:0%
favor of this bill because for me the
 
02:02:31.030 --> 02:02:31.040 align:start position:0%
bottom line is the information on these
 
02:02:34.669 --> 02:02:34.679 align:start position:0%
assessment tests belong to the parents
 
02:02:38.030 --> 02:02:38.040 align:start position:0%
and what they do with that information
 
02:02:41.390 --> 02:02:41.400 align:start position:0%
is their business and if the their child
 
02:02:44.390 --> 02:02:44.400 align:start position:0%
needs help and the school doesn't have
 
02:02:47.589 --> 02:02:47.599 align:start position:0%
time to go through the test Rhythm I
 
02:02:50.030 --> 02:02:50.040 align:start position:0%
think we need to give parents more
 
02:02:52.470 --> 02:02:52.480 align:start position:0%
leeway and let them know what's going on
 
02:02:54.629 --> 02:02:54.639 align:start position:0%
with their child thank you thank you
 
02:02:58.430 --> 02:02:58.440 align:start position:0%
very much further further discussion re
 
02:03:02.310 --> 02:03:02.320 align:start position:0%
Mullen re Mullen thank you Mr chair um
 
02:03:04.030 --> 02:03:04.040 align:start position:0%
and thank you representative cordelli
 
02:03:06.790 --> 02:03:06.800 align:start position:0%
it's actually a question for you um in
 
02:03:10.790 --> 02:03:10.800 align:start position:0%
section two of the amendment it says uh
 
02:03:13.069 --> 02:03:13.079 align:start position:0%
at Roman numeral 2 line 10 the
 
02:03:15.910 --> 02:03:15.920 align:start position:0%
department May provide or may request
 
02:03:17.790 --> 02:03:17.800 align:start position:0%
the testing entity to provide the
 
02:03:19.430 --> 02:03:19.440 align:start position:0%
assessments to
 
02:03:23.030 --> 02:03:23.040 align:start position:0%
parents guardians or uh the pupil school
 
02:03:25.950 --> 02:03:25.960 align:start position:0%
so that's a May and then in section
 
02:03:28.629 --> 02:03:28.639 align:start position:0%
three it talks about the report shall be
 
02:03:31.430 --> 02:03:31.440 align:start position:0%
provided to the parents I don't see any
 
02:03:34.310 --> 02:03:34.320 align:start position:0%
provision for the school getting the
 
02:03:37.790 --> 02:03:37.800 align:start position:0%
report uh I I see a May request May
 
02:03:40.109 --> 02:03:40.119 align:start position:0%
provide but I don't see a shall provide
 
02:03:43.589 --> 02:03:43.599 align:start position:0%
to the school uh is that stated
 
02:03:46.669 --> 02:03:46.679 align:start position:0%
somewhere else in 193 that I have uh yet
 
02:03:46.679 --> 02:03:47.510 align:start position:0%
somewhere else in 193 that I have uh yet
to

02:03:47.510 --> 02:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:03:50.629 --> 02:03:50.639 align:start position:0%
unearth I I believe it is but I I would
 
02:03:54.310 --> 02:03:54.320 align:start position:0%
also read it um the current statute says
 
02:03:57.830 --> 02:03:57.840 align:start position:0%
the department May provide
 
02:04:02.270 --> 02:04:02.280 align:start position:0%
um to the parents guarding or pupil
 
02:04:06.549 --> 02:04:06.559 align:start position:0%
school as provided in 193
 
02:04:11.030 --> 02:04:11.040 align:start position:0%
C11 um so my my uh my issue
 
02:04:14.189 --> 02:04:14.199 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli is that prior to
 
02:04:16.790 --> 02:04:16.800 align:start position:0%
this change the schools were receiving
 
02:04:19.229 --> 02:04:19.239 align:start position:0%
the reports and sending the reports out
 
02:04:21.229 --> 02:04:21.239 align:start position:0%
so we know that the school was getting
 
02:04:23.229 --> 02:04:23.239 align:start position:0%
the report because the school was
 
02:04:26.510 --> 02:04:26.520 align:start position:0%
responsible for sending the report um I
 
02:04:28.510 --> 02:04:28.520 align:start position:0%
just don't see any provision for that
 
02:04:31.030 --> 02:04:31.040 align:start position:0%
school getting those reports for the
 
02:04:34.310 --> 02:04:34.320 align:start position:0%
school file um because obviously this
 
02:04:35.589 --> 02:04:35.599 align:start position:0%
information is going to be pretty
 
02:04:37.790 --> 02:04:37.800 align:start position:0%
critical to them as
 
02:04:40.750 --> 02:04:40.760 align:start position:0%
well go ahead yes yes is my
 
02:04:43.350 --> 02:04:43.360 align:start position:0%
understanding that the school um
 
02:04:45.470 --> 02:04:45.480 align:start position:0%
automatically gets that information
 
02:04:47.830 --> 02:04:47.840 align:start position:0%
almost immediately after that the uh
 
02:04:50.669 --> 02:04:50.679 align:start position:0%
test uh um is
 
02:04:53.470 --> 02:04:53.480 align:start position:0%
taken so I don't think that there's any
 
02:04:56.669 --> 02:04:56.679 align:start position:0%
problem with the school not getting the
 
02:04:59.030 --> 02:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
data okay I guess we'll we'll have to
 
02:05:01.109 --> 02:05:01.119 align:start position:0%
wait and see should this uh should this
 
02:05:04.310 --> 02:05:04.320 align:start position:0%
go through thank you we we had testimony
 
02:05:06.750 --> 02:05:06.760 align:start position:0%
from the Department during the hearing
 
02:05:08.870 --> 02:05:08.880 align:start position:0%
of this bill that the school does
 
02:05:12.830 --> 02:05:12.840 align:start position:0%
receive this instantly uh from from the
 
02:05:15.069 --> 02:05:15.079 align:start position:0%
you know due to the technology that's
 
02:05:17.830 --> 02:05:17.840 align:start position:0%
associated with this test right my point
 
02:05:20.709 --> 02:05:20.719 align:start position:0%
my point Mr sh is that as the law
 
02:05:24.589 --> 02:05:24.599 align:start position:0%
currently exists the school is tasked
 
02:05:26.589 --> 02:05:26.599 align:start position:0%
with providing the information to the
 
02:05:29.549 --> 02:05:29.559 align:start position:0%
parent therefore it receives the results
 
02:05:32.109 --> 02:05:32.119 align:start position:0%
as part of that process if we take the
 
02:05:35.790 --> 02:05:35.800 align:start position:0%
school out of the process of providing
 
02:05:37.790 --> 02:05:37.800 align:start position:0%
the information to the parent my
 
02:05:40.870 --> 02:05:40.880 align:start position:0%
question then is do we need to stipulate
 
02:05:44.270 --> 02:05:44.280 align:start position:0%
that the school shall receive or have
 
02:05:47.430 --> 02:05:47.440 align:start position:0%
access to the results it's uh it
 
02:05:50.229 --> 02:05:50.239 align:start position:0%
certainly I I understand your response
 
02:05:53.229 --> 02:05:53.239 align:start position:0%
uh yeah to follow up with that uh under
 
02:05:55.910 --> 02:05:55.920 align:start position:0%
Essa and you look at the Assurance this
 
02:05:58.709 --> 02:05:58.719 align:start position:0%
portion of it which is uh associated
 
02:06:01.709 --> 02:06:01.719 align:start position:0%
with the section 1111 four ones
 
02:06:04.830 --> 02:06:04.840 align:start position:0%
parentheses B parentheses 3 it says in
 
02:06:07.270 --> 02:06:07.280 align:start position:0%
general each local Education Agency plan
 
02:06:09.310 --> 02:06:09.320 align:start position:0%
shall provide assurances that the local
 
02:06:13.589 --> 02:06:13.599 align:start position:0%
Education Agency will inure and ensure
 
02:06:15.310 --> 02:06:15.320 align:start position:0%
that the results from the academic
 
02:06:17.430 --> 02:06:17.440 align:start position:0%
assessments required under Section it
 
02:06:19.950 --> 02:06:19.960 align:start position:0%
lists again that code M will be provided
 
02:06:22.350 --> 02:06:22.360 align:start position:0%
to parents and teachers as soon as is
 
02:06:25.189 --> 02:06:25.199 align:start position:0%
practicably possible after the test is
 
02:06:28.549 --> 02:06:28.559 align:start position:0%
taken in an understandable in uniform
 
02:06:31.910 --> 02:06:31.920 align:start position:0%
format and to the extent practicable
 
02:06:33.310 --> 02:06:33.320 align:start position:0%
provided in the language that the
 
02:06:35.790 --> 02:06:35.800 align:start position:0%
parents can understand so Federal Law
 
02:06:39.750 --> 02:06:39.760 align:start position:0%
requires the LA to to do that basically
 
02:06:43.310 --> 02:06:43.320 align:start position:0%
as soon as possible again I just want to
 
02:06:48.430 --> 02:06:48.440 align:start position:0%
state that we're changing the law if we
 
02:06:51.549 --> 02:06:51.559 align:start position:0%
it if we supersede the school district
 
02:06:53.390 --> 02:06:53.400 align:start position:0%
receiving the information in order to
 
02:06:56.950 --> 02:06:56.960 align:start position:0%
send it to the parent then uh none of
 
02:06:58.950 --> 02:06:58.960 align:start position:0%
that is going to be applicable because
 
02:07:01.430 --> 02:07:01.440 align:start position:0%
the school will no longer be
 
02:07:04.229 --> 02:07:04.239 align:start position:0%
responsible for sending it to the parent
 
02:07:08.030 --> 02:07:08.040 align:start position:0%
so I just want to acknowledge the idea
 
02:07:10.709 --> 02:07:10.719 align:start position:0%
that we are changing the order of
 
02:07:14.149 --> 02:07:14.159 align:start position:0%
operations here if you will on who gets
 
02:07:16.430 --> 02:07:16.440 align:start position:0%
the information when and how it gets to
 
02:07:19.910 --> 02:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
parents thank you very much uh are there
 
02:07:22.229 --> 02:07:22.239 align:start position:0%
F Is there further discussion yeah we
 
02:07:25.830 --> 02:07:25.840 align:start position:0%
had R Miler then wood
 
02:07:28.669 --> 02:07:28.679 align:start position:0%
then okay representative Myer then
 
02:07:31.549 --> 02:07:31.559 align:start position:0%
represent Woodcock and then represent L
 
02:07:33.830 --> 02:07:33.840 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chair this is for
 
02:07:36.669 --> 02:07:36.679 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli that in a in the
 
02:07:38.750 --> 02:07:38.760 align:start position:0%
conversation that we had earlier in the
 
02:07:42.189 --> 02:07:42.199 align:start position:0%
testimony was there any clarification of
 
02:07:45.910 --> 02:07:45.920 align:start position:0%
how soon the testing agency may have a
 
02:07:48.830 --> 02:07:48.840 align:start position:0%
portal with which the parent can go in
 
02:07:53.350 --> 02:07:53.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:56.870 --> 02:07:56.880 align:start position:0%
information I I do not recall a time
 
02:07:59.030 --> 02:07:59.040 align:start position:0%
frame associated with that other than it
 
02:08:02.830 --> 02:08:02.840 align:start position:0%
was in the works I believe but I stand
 
02:08:05.310 --> 02:08:05.320 align:start position:0%
to be corrected on any time frames that
 
02:08:08.189 --> 02:08:08.199 align:start position:0%
were mentioned all right I I just raised
 
02:08:10.430 --> 02:08:10.440 align:start position:0%
that because if in fact there there
 
02:08:13.430 --> 02:08:13.440 align:start position:0%
would be a portal for parents to get
 
02:08:16.470 --> 02:08:16.480 align:start position:0%
that information that would also provide
 
02:08:19.270 --> 02:08:19.280 align:start position:0%
more immediate access to that dat to
 
02:08:22.109 --> 02:08:22.119 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
02:08:24.430 --> 02:08:24.440 align:start position:0%
whitcock thank you Mr chairman I I have
 
02:08:26.910 --> 02:08:26.920 align:start position:0%
a question on the amendment for uh
 
02:08:28.910 --> 02:08:28.920 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli if it's possible
 
02:08:31.310 --> 02:08:31.320 align:start position:0%
I have two questions actually uh
 
02:08:32.510 --> 02:08:32.520 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli I'm looking at
 
02:08:35.149 --> 02:08:35.159 align:start position:0%
section three where it said the report
 
02:08:38.750 --> 02:08:38.760 align:start position:0%
shall be provided the part that I'm that
 
02:08:40.750 --> 02:08:40.760 align:start position:0%
I want Clarity on where it says
 
02:08:43.149 --> 02:08:43.159 align:start position:0%
informative and instructional Mana to
 
02:08:45.430 --> 02:08:45.440 align:start position:0%
help the children meet the challenging
 
02:08:47.470 --> 02:08:47.480 align:start position:0%
State ecademic Standards yet what does
 
02:08:50.470 --> 02:08:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:53.149 --> 02:08:53.159 align:start position:0%
um I think that that uh language is
 
02:08:55.950 --> 02:08:55.960 align:start position:0%
taken from the uh other bill that
 
02:08:58.069 --> 02:08:58.079 align:start position:0%
addressed this issue
 
02:09:02.310 --> 02:09:02.320 align:start position:0%
323 um and was reflected in the uh Essa
 
02:09:05.149 --> 02:09:05.159 align:start position:0%
uh standards that the uh chairman uh
 
02:09:06.990 --> 02:09:07.000 align:start position:0%
just read as
 
02:09:11.629 --> 02:09:11.639 align:start position:0%
well well follow up Mr chairman yes
 
02:09:12.589 --> 02:09:12.599 align:start position:0%
thank you that doesn't answer the
 
02:09:14.950 --> 02:09:14.960 align:start position:0%
question but that's okay what is if it's
 
02:09:16.790 --> 02:09:16.800 align:start position:0%
going to be a report let me go to PO B
 
02:09:19.149 --> 02:09:19.159 align:start position:0%
then what is that what does that mean
 
02:09:21.069 --> 02:09:21.079 align:start position:0%
and as it looks like to the Stu where it
 
02:09:22.950 --> 02:09:22.960 align:start position:0%
says the report if it's coming directly
 
02:09:25.950 --> 02:09:25.960 align:start position:0%
from the testing agency how how is this
 
02:09:28.189 --> 02:09:28.199 align:start position:0%
going to be indivi individualized for
 
02:09:30.149 --> 02:09:30.159 align:start position:0%
students and parents to get the
 
02:09:33.430 --> 02:09:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:37.030 --> 02:09:37.040 align:start position:0%
need that's a question the report either
 
02:09:39.549 --> 02:09:39.559 align:start position:0%
from the school district the department
 
02:09:42.790 --> 02:09:42.800 align:start position:0%
or the testing agency uh shall be
 
02:09:45.270 --> 02:09:45.280 align:start position:0%
provided in an informative uh and
 
02:09:48.669 --> 02:09:48.679 align:start position:0%
understandable manner to the parents um
 
02:09:52.030 --> 02:09:52.040 align:start position:0%
uh I'm not sure if you're looking for a
 
02:09:55.669 --> 02:09:55.679 align:start position:0%
layout of the report or uh I'm not sure
 
02:09:58.390 --> 02:09:58.400 align:start position:0%
U what you're looking for in that regard
 
02:10:02.069 --> 02:10:02.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:04.830 --> 02:10:04.840 align:start position:0%
chairman go ahead that's that's the
 
02:10:06.470 --> 02:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
exact you're giving me the answer to the
 
02:10:08.430 --> 02:10:08.440 align:start position:0%
exact same question I just asked you
 
02:10:11.109 --> 02:10:11.119 align:start position:0%
which was what is form instructional you
 
02:10:12.750 --> 02:10:12.760 align:start position:0%
g that now use as an answer a minute ago
 
02:10:15.270 --> 02:10:15.280 align:start position:0%
was a question my point is if I receive
 
02:10:18.430 --> 02:10:18.440 align:start position:0%
a document from the taston agency about
 
02:10:21.270 --> 02:10:21.280 align:start position:0%
youngsta that says they need these these
 
02:10:22.589 --> 02:10:22.599 align:start position:0%
uh additional Services because their
 
02:10:24.229 --> 02:10:24.239 align:start position:0%
grades are low their assessment levels
 
02:10:25.990 --> 02:10:26.000 align:start position:0%
are low how is that going to be
 
02:10:28.109 --> 02:10:28.119 align:start position:0%
personalized so the parents know what
 
02:10:29.750 --> 02:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
they're getting so they can do something
 
02:10:32.549 --> 02:10:32.559 align:start position:0%
about it who does that if it comes from
 
02:10:36.229 --> 02:10:36.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:39.109 --> 02:10:39.119 align:start position:0%
that I believe that the report that is
 
02:10:43.629 --> 02:10:43.639 align:start position:0%
sent out now I I would ask then U how
 
02:10:46.910 --> 02:10:46.920 align:start position:0%
does the school personalize that data um
 
02:10:48.750 --> 02:10:48.760 align:start position:0%
we've heard testimony that that some
 
02:10:51.669 --> 02:10:51.679 align:start position:0%
schools wait uh until the fall to go
 
02:10:53.350 --> 02:10:53.360 align:start position:0%
over those results at the beginning of
 
02:10:56.310 --> 02:10:56.320 align:start position:0%
the school year um which I think is uh
 
02:10:58.149 --> 02:10:58.159 align:start position:0%
one of the concerns about the federal
 
02:11:00.510 --> 02:11:00.520 align:start position:0%
requirements under Essa in terms of a
 
02:11:05.109 --> 02:11:05.119 align:start position:0%
timely uh information to the parent
 
02:11:08.790 --> 02:11:08.800 align:start position:0%
um I I I I'm not sure if I understand
 
02:11:10.870 --> 02:11:10.880 align:start position:0%
really what the problem is in this
 
02:11:14.669 --> 02:11:14.679 align:start position:0%
regard Sor final final followup Mr
 
02:11:17.950 --> 02:11:17.960 align:start position:0%
chairman so the the point is represent
 
02:11:17.960 --> 02:11:18.870 align:start position:0%
chairman so the the point is represent
qu

02:11:18.870 --> 02:11:18.880 align:start position:0%

parent hanging and it says you're going
 
02:11:46.069 --> 02:11:46.079 align:start position:0%

um the current statute
 
02:11:59.310 --> 02:11:59.320 align:start position:0%
reads 193
 
02:12:02.390 --> 02:12:02.400 align:start position:0%
C12 uh in part the department May
 
02:12:04.149 --> 02:12:04.159 align:start position:0%

02:12:13.270 --> 02:12:13.280 align:start position:0%
provided in the uh P Tire
 
02:12:17.709 --> 02:12:17.719 align:start position:0%
paragraph um basically we're adding that
 
02:12:22.069 --> 02:12:22.079 align:start position:0%
the option that the testing entity do
 
02:12:25.109 --> 02:12:25.119 align:start position:0%
the same thing and requiring that it be
 
02:12:28.109 --> 02:12:28.119 align:start position:0%
in an informative format that uh is
 
02:12:31.270 --> 02:12:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:34.910 --> 02:12:34.920 align:start position:0%
parent okay go ahead just it's
 
02:12:37.990 --> 02:12:38.000 align:start position:0%
clarifying the um existing statute and
 
02:12:40.470 --> 02:12:40.480 align:start position:0%
that it has to be informative uh to the
 
02:12:46.430 --> 02:12:46.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:48.750 --> 02:12:48.760 align:start position:0%
requirement represent
 
02:12:48.760 --> 02:12:49.750 align:start position:0%
requirement represent
and

02:12:49.750 --> 02:12:49.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:12:49.760 --> 02:12:51.709 align:start position:0%
and
then

02:12:51.709 --> 02:12:51.719 align:start position:0%
then
 
02:12:54.990 --> 02:12:55.000 align:start position:0%
represent oh
 
02:12:58.229 --> 02:12:58.239 align:start position:0%
um I had two things but well I had one
 
02:13:00.990 --> 02:13:01.000 align:start position:0%
but I just wanted to go back to what the
 
02:13:04.549 --> 02:13:04.559 align:start position:0%
testimony they gave was my understanding
 
02:13:06.709 --> 02:13:06.719 align:start position:0%
was that the format that the testing
 
02:13:09.189 --> 02:13:09.199 align:start position:0%
agency put all these out
 
02:13:12.950 --> 02:13:12.960 align:start position:0%
into was that informative
 
02:13:16.390 --> 02:13:16.400 align:start position:0%
whatever type so it would be the testing
 
02:13:18.870 --> 02:13:18.880 align:start position:0%
agency I mean this is my understanding
 
02:13:21.790 --> 02:13:21.800 align:start position:0%
from the hearing and what they said is
 
02:13:23.830 --> 02:13:23.840 align:start position:0%
it's the testing agency that puts that
 
02:13:25.430 --> 02:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
out whether they put it to the
 
02:13:27.629 --> 02:13:27.639 align:start position:0%
department or the school or the kid that
 
02:13:29.870 --> 02:13:29.880 align:start position:0%
they're the one that puts it in that
 
02:13:31.910 --> 02:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
informative um
 
02:13:36.310 --> 02:13:36.320 align:start position:0%
format and the other thing I is
 
02:13:40.430 --> 02:13:40.440 align:start position:0%
um doesn't Essa take
 
02:13:45.030 --> 02:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
um precedent I take um don't we have to
 
02:13:46.950 --> 02:13:46.960 align:start position:0%
follow the Essa
 
02:13:50.350 --> 02:13:50.360 align:start position:0%
regulations regardless of this bill so
 
02:13:53.990 --> 02:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
the fact that the Essa regulations say
 
02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:56.430 align:start position:0%
the fact that the Essa regulations say
that

02:13:56.430 --> 02:13:56.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:13:59.990 --> 02:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
um I'm sorry I've lost it I was trying
 
02:14:04.030 --> 02:14:04.040 align:start position:0%
to respond to representative Mullen and
 
02:14:06.470 --> 02:14:06.480 align:start position:0%
say that we may be changing the state
 
02:14:08.470 --> 02:14:08.480 align:start position:0%
part of this but the federal part has to
 
02:14:11.510 --> 02:14:11.520 align:start position:0%
remain the same I
 
02:14:14.109 --> 02:14:14.119 align:start position:0%
believe further
 
02:14:18.430 --> 02:14:18.440 align:start position:0%
questions Tanner is rep Tanner thank you
 
02:14:21.589 --> 02:14:21.599 align:start position:0%
Mr chair um I would like to go back to
 
02:14:23.189 --> 02:14:23.199 align:start position:0%
the portal issue I was wondering if
 
02:14:25.109 --> 02:14:25.119 align:start position:0%
there's somebody online that's from the
 
02:14:26.950 --> 02:14:26.960 align:start position:0%
State Department of Education who might
 
02:14:30.189 --> 02:14:30.199 align:start position:0%
be able to let us know the status of the
 
02:14:32.390 --> 02:14:32.400 align:start position:0%

02:15:00.030 --> 02:15:00.040 align:start position:0%
unnecessary thank

02:19:46.429 --> 02:19:46.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:49.270 --> 02:19:49.280 align:start position:0%
motion we have
 
02:19:52.630 --> 02:19:52.640 align:start position:0%
a a question okay rip
 
02:19:52.640 --> 02:19:54.510 align:start position:0%
a a question okay rip
sha

02:19:54.510 --> 02:19:54.520 align:start position:0%
sha
 
02:19:57.870 --> 02:19:57.880 align:start position:0%
um to I'm I'm not sure maybe I'm not
 
02:20:00.830 --> 02:20:00.840 align:start position:0%
reading it right but it seems to me that
 
02:20:04.990 --> 02:20:05.000 align:start position:0%
the amendment takes a is more definitive
 
02:20:08.510 --> 02:20:08.520 align:start position:0%
on the fact that the testing entity
 
02:20:11.230 --> 02:20:11.240 align:start position:0%
provides the information whereas the
 
02:20:16.510 --> 02:20:16.520 align:start position:0%
original Bill uh has the May request so
 
02:20:18.349 --> 02:20:18.359 align:start position:0%
it it all
 
02:20:19.870 --> 02:20:19.880 align:start position:0%
uh some
 
02:20:22.990 --> 02:20:23.000 align:start position:0%
flexibility on whether the districts
 
02:20:26.389 --> 02:20:26.399 align:start position:0%
decide to let the entity provide the
 
02:20:29.389 --> 02:20:29.399 align:start position:0%
information or whether the district
 
02:20:31.349 --> 02:20:31.359 align:start position:0%
would prefer to do it their way with
 
02:20:34.710 --> 02:20:34.720 align:start position:0%
their conferences or whatever it is that
 
02:20:38.990 --> 02:20:39.000 align:start position:0%
they uh um that they use to distribute
 
02:20:39.000 --> 02:20:40.110 align:start position:0%
they uh um that they use to distribute
the

02:20:40.110 --> 02:20:40.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:20:45.550 --> 02:20:45.560 align:start position:0%
results um I personally like the
 
02:20:49.510 --> 02:20:49.520 align:start position:0%
approach that many district views where
 
02:20:52.710 --> 02:20:52.720 align:start position:0%
they have uh the conferences the last
 
02:20:55.830 --> 02:20:55.840 align:start position:0%
quarter and they use they they give the
 
02:20:58.630 --> 02:20:58.640 align:start position:0%
test results to the parents and they
 
02:21:02.870 --> 02:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
explain what they mean because uh I do
 
02:21:07.950 --> 02:21:07.960 align:start position:0%
not feel that a uh a testing entity is
 
02:21:11.710 --> 02:21:11.720 align:start position:0%
going to have the language in it that
 
02:21:15.790 --> 02:21:15.800 align:start position:0%
reaches uh all of the parents especially
 
02:21:19.070 --> 02:21:19.080 align:start position:0%
those who are either non-english
 
02:21:21.950 --> 02:21:21.960 align:start position:0%
speaking or whatever um I think it would
 
02:21:25.429 --> 02:21:25.439 align:start position:0%
be easier to not have the amendment to
 
02:21:29.030 --> 02:21:29.040 align:start position:0%
just leave it I like the the June 30th
 
02:21:32.469 --> 02:21:32.479 align:start position:0%
date and and uh it was stated in
 
02:21:36.190 --> 02:21:36.200 align:start position:0%
testimony that the information comes up
 
02:21:38.110 --> 02:21:38.120 align:start position:0%
almost immediately when the child is
 
02:21:41.270 --> 02:21:41.280 align:start position:0%
done with the test so it could be
 
02:21:45.309 --> 02:21:45.319 align:start position:0%
disseminated at that time so I think the
 
02:21:48.469 --> 02:21:48.479 align:start position:0%
bill itself is is good and I I will
 
02:21:51.389 --> 02:21:51.399 align:start position:0%
support the bill but I'm questioning
 
02:21:55.670 --> 02:21:55.680 align:start position:0%
whether the amendment puts a little more
 
02:21:59.469 --> 02:21:59.479 align:start position:0%
emphasis on the testing entity that I
 
02:22:02.190 --> 02:22:02.200 align:start position:0%
prefer to leave as May
 
02:22:04.990 --> 02:22:05.000 align:start position:0%
request that's just my opinion thank you
 
02:22:06.030 --> 02:22:06.040 align:start position:0%
very much
 
02:22:08.550 --> 02:22:08.560 align:start position:0%
representative representative Shaw for
 
02:22:12.110 --> 02:22:12.120 align:start position:0%
as a as a point for you to consider is
 
02:22:15.070 --> 02:22:15.080 align:start position:0%
that the testing date of of June 30th is
 
02:22:18.230 --> 02:22:18.240 align:start position:0%
not in this bill that's in three
 
02:22:21.190 --> 02:22:21.200 align:start position:0%
23 oh sorry that's that's another bill
 
02:22:22.910 --> 02:22:22.920 align:start position:0%
this is a bill simply that allows the
 
02:22:26.429 --> 02:22:26.439 align:start position:0%
testing entity to send materials off
 
02:22:29.070 --> 02:22:29.080 align:start position:0%
to representative leus you have your
 
02:22:31.110 --> 02:22:31.120 align:start position:0%
hand up uh yes thank you Mr chair
 
02:22:33.190 --> 02:22:33.200 align:start position:0%
representative Lon my mother just
 
02:22:35.110 --> 02:22:35.120 align:start position:0%

immigrant mostly English Lang language
 
02:22:41.950 --> 02:22:41.960 align:start position:0%
learner school and the testing
 
02:22:43.870 --> 02:22:43.880 align:start position:0%
organizations were able to provide those
 
02:22:46.990 --> 02:22:47.000 align:start position:0%
results to the parents in Spanish taglog
 
02:22:50.429 --> 02:22:50.439 align:start position:0%
and and um some other other rare
 
02:22:52.190 --> 02:22:52.200 align:start position:0%
dialects that were coming from South
 
02:22:54.270 --> 02:22:54.280 align:start position:0%
America as well so I'm not sure about
 
02:22:55.830 --> 02:22:55.840 align:start position:0%
who we contract with but I know that
 
02:22:56.950 --> 02:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
there's actually some great
 
02:22:58.550 --> 02:22:58.560 align:start position:0%
opportunities for them to communicate
 
02:23:00.750 --> 02:23:00.760 align:start position:0%
those school scores perhaps even better
 
02:23:02.830 --> 02:23:02.840 align:start position:0%

02:24:07.870 --> 02:24:07.880 align:start position:0%
which we have yes thank you Mr chairman
 
02:24:12.070 --> 02:24:12.080 align:start position:0%
uh I think uh that the basic question
 
02:24:16.030 --> 02:24:16.040 align:start position:0%
was about the uh portal Parent Portal
 
02:24:19.550 --> 02:24:19.560 align:start position:0%
that was mentioned uh during the hearing
 
02:24:25.230 --> 02:24:25.240 align:start position:0%
um and the status of that uh uh
 
02:24:28.469 --> 02:24:28.479 align:start position:0%
tool okay yes I um did speak with our
 
02:24:31.790 --> 02:24:31.800 align:start position:0%
camem assessment uh vendor on Friday and
 
02:24:33.830 --> 02:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
they are going to be looking into that
 
02:24:35.830 --> 02:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
they were working on De Dev developing
 
02:24:38.710 --> 02:24:38.720 align:start position:0%
that Parent Portal last year and then
 
02:24:41.429 --> 02:24:41.439 align:start position:0%
once um we had the pandemic hit they
 
02:24:43.469 --> 02:24:43.479 align:start position:0%
switched to developing and putting all
 
02:24:45.910 --> 02:24:45.920 align:start position:0%
their resources into developing remote
 
02:24:48.230 --> 02:24:48.240 align:start position:0%
administration of the assessments so
 
02:24:51.030 --> 02:24:51.040 align:start position:0%
that project was put on hold I think
 
02:24:55.030 --> 02:24:55.040 align:start position:0%
their plan is to pick that back up again
 
02:24:57.429 --> 02:24:57.439 align:start position:0%
um this summer but they were going to
 
02:24:59.389 --> 02:24:59.399 align:start position:0%
provide me a a
 
02:25:02.670 --> 02:25:02.680 align:start position:0%
timeline um next week so hopefully
 
02:25:03.910 --> 02:25:03.920 align:start position:0%
they'll be able to get that to me and
 
02:25:05.429 --> 02:25:05.439 align:start position:0%
then I can share that with you so the
 
02:25:07.389 --> 02:25:07.399 align:start position:0%
parent portal is not available at this
 
02:25:08.990 --> 02:25:09.000 align:start position:0%
time but it is in
 
02:25:11.070 --> 02:25:11.080 align:start position:0%
development thank you very much are
 
02:25:12.790 --> 02:25:12.800 align:start position:0%
there questions for Miss White from
 
02:25:15.990 --> 02:25:16.000 align:start position:0%
committee members we have re Cornell and
 
02:25:18.030 --> 02:25:18.040 align:start position:0%
uh White
 
02:25:20.870 --> 02:25:20.880 align:start position:0%
representative Cornell Thank you for
 
02:25:22.670 --> 02:25:22.680 align:start position:0%
taking the time to come over and answer
 
02:25:24.630 --> 02:25:24.640 align:start position:0%
our questions I was just wondering if
 
02:25:26.630 --> 02:25:26.640 align:start position:0%
you had the information of how many
 
02:25:29.590 --> 02:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
school districts don't Supply this
 
02:25:32.070 --> 02:25:32.080 align:start position:0%
information to parents in a timely
 
02:25:35.030 --> 02:25:35.040 align:start position:0%
matter how many don't send them home you
 
02:25:38.990 --> 02:25:39.000 align:start position:0%
know or in time CF meetings or put them
 
02:25:41.510 --> 02:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
off I'm not sure the exact number of
 
02:25:43.349 --> 02:25:43.359 align:start position:0%
schools that are not providing this
 
02:25:45.950 --> 02:25:45.960 align:start position:0%
information usually at the department we
 
02:25:47.670 --> 02:25:47.680 align:start position:0%
tend to hear from the parents that did
 
02:25:50.710 --> 02:25:50.720 align:start position:0%
not receive it and so they reach out to
 
02:25:53.990 --> 02:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
us about that I'm I'm sorry there's some
 
02:25:57.030 --> 02:25:57.040 align:start position:0%
feedback there um so what we don't have
 
02:25:58.750 --> 02:25:58.760 align:start position:0%
exact numbers of how many schools are
 
02:26:00.790 --> 02:26:00.800 align:start position:0%
not doing that we just tend to hear from
 
02:26:02.630 --> 02:26:02.640 align:start position:0%
U parents that reach out to us and then
 
02:26:05.110 --> 02:26:05.120 align:start position:0%
we reach out to the school to please uh
 
02:26:08.110 --> 02:26:08.120 align:start position:0%
release that information to parents H
 
02:26:10.550 --> 02:26:10.560 align:start position:0%
about how many parents reach out to you
 
02:26:12.990 --> 02:26:13.000 align:start position:0%
to go I would imagine the parents that
 
02:26:15.469 --> 02:26:15.479 align:start position:0%
reach out are from the same
 
02:26:18.790 --> 02:26:18.800 align:start position:0%
schools you have any idea of how
 
02:26:21.349 --> 02:26:21.359 align:start position:0%
many not necessarily sometimes it's
 
02:26:24.150 --> 02:26:24.160 align:start position:0%
districtwide uh I can only really
 
02:26:25.349 --> 02:26:25.359 align:start position:0%
because I have only been in this
 
02:26:27.429 --> 02:26:27.439 align:start position:0%
position for about a year and we did not
 
02:26:30.349 --> 02:26:30.359 align:start position:0%
have an Administration last spring I can
 
02:26:33.550 --> 02:26:33.560 align:start position:0%
speak to the um fall Administration and
 
02:26:35.790 --> 02:26:35.800 align:start position:0%
I would say I've had about 25 parents
 
02:26:39.429 --> 02:26:39.439 align:start position:0%
reach out to me about just Statewide
 
02:26:41.429 --> 02:26:41.439 align:start position:0%
about wanting to receive their results
 
02:26:44.670 --> 02:26:44.680 align:start position:0%
okay thank you and I apologize I I
 
02:26:48.510 --> 02:26:48.520 align:start position:0%
didn't mention with the SAT T that
 
02:26:51.309 --> 02:26:51.319 align:start position:0%
Parent Portal is available so parents do
 
02:26:54.070 --> 02:26:54.080 align:start position:0%
have access to the SAT portal to get
 
02:26:55.950 --> 02:26:55.960 align:start position:0%
their students results and so do the
 
02:26:58.590 --> 02:26:58.600 align:start position:0%
students so that is in um effect right
 
02:27:00.230 --> 02:27:00.240 align:start position:0%
now and they can access that so I'm
 
02:27:02.190 --> 02:27:02.200 align:start position:0%
sorry I didn't clarify that
 
02:27:04.389 --> 02:27:04.399 align:start position:0%
earlier Miss Miss White do you have time
 
02:27:07.309 --> 02:27:07.319 align:start position:0%
for one more question yes sir
 
02:27:10.110 --> 02:27:10.120 align:start position:0%
absolutely like this question yes I do
 
02:27:13.870 --> 02:27:13.880 align:start position:0%
have a question for you um I understand
 
02:27:17.950 --> 02:27:17.960 align:start position:0%
that in law at the moment it says that
 
02:27:20.269 --> 02:27:20.279 align:start position:0%
the testing agency can't give out any of
 
02:27:22.590 --> 02:27:22.600 align:start position:0%
the information that we give them my
 
02:27:25.349 --> 02:27:25.359 align:start position:0%
question is is there any is there any
 
02:27:30.630 --> 02:27:30.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:33.750 --> 02:27:33.760 align:start position:0%
do so and let me see if I understand the
 
02:27:36.110 --> 02:27:36.120 align:start position:0%
question correctly do we have the
 
02:27:38.429 --> 02:27:38.439 align:start position:0%
ability to give the assessment results
 
02:27:38.439 --> 02:27:39.389 align:start position:0%
ability to give the assessment results
to

02:27:39.389 --> 02:27:39.399 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:27:42.790 --> 02:27:42.800 align:start position:0%
parents no the testing res the testing
 
02:27:46.230 --> 02:27:46.240 align:start position:0%
entity gets information on the students
 
02:27:48.269 --> 02:27:48.279 align:start position:0%
and they're not allowed to give that out
 
02:27:51.670 --> 02:27:51.680 align:start position:0%
to anybody except you know who we say
 
02:27:53.830 --> 02:27:53.840 align:start position:0%
that they can give it out to and my
 
02:27:56.830 --> 02:27:56.840 align:start position:0%
question is if they were to give it out
 
02:27:58.469 --> 02:27:58.479 align:start position:0%
you know for security reasons I'm
 
02:28:00.349 --> 02:28:00.359 align:start position:0%
wondering if they were to give it out to
 
02:28:04.110 --> 02:28:04.120 align:start position:0%
somebody else do we have any
 
02:28:09.110 --> 02:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
um anything that we can do you know just
 
02:28:11.110 --> 02:28:11.120 align:start position:0%
I believe in um I would have to go back
 
02:28:12.710 --> 02:28:12.720 align:start position:0%
and look at our contract but I believe
 
02:28:14.590 --> 02:28:14.600 align:start position:0%
our memor our memorandum of
 
02:28:16.790 --> 02:28:16.800 align:start position:0%
understanding or our exchange agreement
 
02:28:18.950 --> 02:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
um because it is a doit Overlook
 
02:28:21.110 --> 02:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
contract there's very specific um
 
02:28:23.870 --> 02:28:23.880 align:start position:0%
guidelines around who can be who that
 
02:28:25.710 --> 02:28:25.720 align:start position:0%
information can be shared with it's
 
02:28:27.710 --> 02:28:27.720 align:start position:0%
pretty explicit so but I'd have to go
 
02:28:29.349 --> 02:28:29.359 align:start position:0%
back and look at the contract more
 
02:28:31.990 --> 02:28:32.000 align:start position:0%
closely to see um who we've
 
02:28:34.190 --> 02:28:34.200 align:start position:0%
designated so if they gave it to
 
02:28:36.790 --> 02:28:36.800 align:start position:0%
somebody else um be they would be
 
02:28:38.790 --> 02:28:38.800 align:start position:0%
violating a contract and we could go
 
02:28:41.510 --> 02:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
after them um for a violation of the
 
02:28:45.110 --> 02:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
contract is that true I believe so but I
 
02:28:47.030 --> 02:28:47.040 align:start position:0%
would probably prefer to have an
 
02:28:50.910 --> 02:28:50.920 align:start position:0%
attorney answer that question if that's
 
02:28:53.950 --> 02:28:53.960 align:start position:0%
okay yeah you're right thank you
 
02:28:57.510 --> 02:28:57.520 align:start position:0%
sorry okay F further questions uh we
 
02:28:59.830 --> 02:28:59.840 align:start position:0%
have reer and
 
02:29:03.269 --> 02:29:03.279 align:start position:0%
uh misson would like to
 
02:29:07.870 --> 02:29:07.880 align:start position:0%
speak okay repr Miler okay so so we now
 
02:29:10.870 --> 02:29:10.880 align:start position:0%
have uh I mean there's no question that
 
02:29:12.590 --> 02:29:12.600 align:start position:0%
parents need to have these reports I
 
02:29:15.110 --> 02:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
mean there's no debate around that the
 
02:29:17.190 --> 02:29:17.200 align:start position:0%
question is the timing of it
 
02:29:19.190 --> 02:29:19.200 align:start position:0%
and we just heard from the Department
 
02:29:23.030 --> 02:29:23.040 align:start position:0%
that there's been 25 parents who have
 
02:29:25.349 --> 02:29:25.359 align:start position:0%
called in we're not sure whether those
 
02:29:28.870 --> 02:29:28.880 align:start position:0%
25 are from one one school or one school
 
02:29:33.150 --> 02:29:33.160 align:start position:0%
district we're talking about 25 parents
 
02:29:34.750 --> 02:29:34.760 align:start position:0%
out of
 
02:29:34.760 --> 02:29:36.269 align:start position:0%
out of
165,000

02:29:36.269 --> 02:29:36.279 align:start position:0%
165,000
 
02:29:38.910 --> 02:29:38.920 align:start position:0%
students who participate in testing in
 
02:29:38.920 --> 02:29:39.790 align:start position:0%
students who participate in testing in
this

02:29:39.790 --> 02:29:39.800 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:29:43.830 --> 02:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
state this bill is not
 
02:29:46.230 --> 02:29:46.240 align:start position:0%
needed these the obviously if these
 
02:29:49.469 --> 02:29:49.479 align:start position:0%
parents parents have a problem these 25
 
02:29:51.469 --> 02:29:51.479 align:start position:0%
they need to talk with the local school
 
02:29:54.670 --> 02:29:54.680 align:start position:0%
district we're talking about changing a
 
02:29:59.590 --> 02:29:59.600 align:start position:0%
policy that obviously is working in 99%
 
02:30:02.590 --> 02:30:02.600 align:start position:0%
of the situation here why would we want
 
02:30:05.429 --> 02:30:05.439 align:start position:0%
to change this if that is the practice
 
02:30:07.790 --> 02:30:07.800 align:start position:0%
that is working at this point in time
 
02:30:09.950 --> 02:30:09.960 align:start position:0%
according to Miss White from the
 
02:30:15.429 --> 02:30:15.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:15.439 --> 02:30:17.670 align:start position:0%
 
needed

02:30:17.670 --> 02:30:17.680 align:start position:0%
needed
 
02:30:20.710 --> 02:30:20.720 align:start position:0%
here we do she she lowered her hand she
 
02:30:23.190 --> 02:30:23.200 align:start position:0%
lowered her
 
02:30:26.590 --> 02:30:26.600 align:start position:0%
hand oh I'm still on though I I think it
 
02:30:31.389 --> 02:30:31.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:33.590 --> 02:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
here I thought yeah somebody said that
 
02:30:36.469 --> 02:30:36.479 align:start position:0%
di hand was back up so she has further
 
02:30:39.990 --> 02:30:40.000 align:start position:0%
comments she can speak if she wants to
 
02:30:41.469 --> 02:30:41.479 align:start position:0%
Miss V do you have any additional
 
02:30:44.269 --> 02:30:44.279 align:start position:0%
information just briefly and thank you
 
02:30:46.510 --> 02:30:46.520 align:start position:0%
uh members of the committee um in
 
02:30:48.469 --> 02:30:48.479 align:start position:0%
regards to the prior question it would
 
02:30:51.750 --> 02:30:51.760 align:start position:0%
be a breach of contract um and it would
 
02:30:55.269 --> 02:30:55.279 align:start position:0%
allow presumably the department to sue
 
02:30:58.190 --> 02:30:58.200 align:start position:0%
the company and it would also give us
 
02:31:00.429 --> 02:31:00.439 align:start position:0%
reasons to exit that contract and
 
02:31:02.990 --> 02:31:03.000 align:start position:0%
presumably seek another vendor um from a
 
02:31:05.269 --> 02:31:05.279 align:start position:0%
business standpoint that's reason enough
 
02:31:07.429 --> 02:31:07.439 align:start position:0%
for the private company to make sure
 
02:31:09.910 --> 02:31:09.920 align:start position:0%
that they don't violate that um but that
 
02:31:12.230 --> 02:31:12.240 align:start position:0%
would enable the department to seek that
 
02:31:14.710 --> 02:31:14.720 align:start position:0%
remedy of of suing
 
02:31:17.349 --> 02:31:17.359 align:start position:0%
them we have not had that situation
 
02:31:19.710 --> 02:31:19.720 align:start position:0%
occur so I can't speak to any particular
 
02:31:21.429 --> 02:31:21.439 align:start position:0%
case in which we've been successful in
 
02:31:23.590 --> 02:31:23.600 align:start position:0%
that but in theory that's what would
 
02:31:27.110 --> 02:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
occur thank you very much with that I'm
 
02:31:30.590 --> 02:31:30.600 align:start position:0%
G try to move into uh taking action on
 
02:31:30.600 --> 02:31:32.389 align:start position:0%
G try to move into uh taking action on
the

02:31:32.389 --> 02:31:32.399 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:31:34.590 --> 02:31:34.600 align:start position:0%
amendment rep Tanner this will be the
 
02:31:37.230 --> 02:31:37.240 align:start position:0%
last uh person recognized for a
 
02:31:40.110 --> 02:31:40.120 align:start position:0%
discussion thank you thank you Mr chair
 
02:31:42.990 --> 02:31:43.000 align:start position:0%
I would just like to ask uh Miss White
 
02:31:45.349 --> 02:31:45.359 align:start position:0%
uh with those 25 parents how was that
 
02:31:48.269 --> 02:31:48.279 align:start position:0%
resolved the uh
 
02:31:51.750 --> 02:31:51.760 align:start position:0%
issue um so I did send out a notice to
 
02:31:54.429 --> 02:31:54.439 align:start position:0%
the building administrator and then to
 
02:31:57.269 --> 02:31:57.279 align:start position:0%
the superintendent's office um just um
 
02:31:58.870 --> 02:31:58.880 align:start position:0%
requesting that they please provide the
 
02:32:01.590 --> 02:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
parent with the information and the
 
02:32:04.150 --> 02:32:04.160 align:start position:0%
results and then also um offered support
 
02:32:06.309 --> 02:32:06.319 align:start position:0%
on how to access those results in case
 
02:32:07.950 --> 02:32:07.960 align:start position:0%
they were not sure how to find that
 
02:32:09.790 --> 02:32:09.800 align:start position:0%

uh when we had the hearing on this I I
 
02:41:16.230 --> 02:41:16.240 align:start position:0%
listened to folks who testified
 
02:41:20.389 --> 02:41:20.399 align:start position:0%
particularly Dr Carl lad uh everybody
 
02:41:20.399 --> 02:41:21.630 align:start position:0%
particularly Dr Carl lad uh everybody
but

02:41:21.630 --> 02:41:21.640 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:41:24.389 --> 02:41:24.399 align:start position:0%
uh particularly him when he speaks for
 
02:41:28.309 --> 02:41:28.319 align:start position:0%
the uh school superintendent Association
 
02:41:31.630 --> 02:41:31.640 align:start position:0%
and and he was neutral on this um which
 
02:41:34.790 --> 02:41:34.800 align:start position:0%

good issues or or good uh points that
 
02:41:43.670 --> 02:41:43.680 align:start position:0%
needed to be addressed and this
 
02:41:46.269 --> 02:41:46.279 align:start position:0%
amendment I think does that uh as the
 
02:41:48.950 --> 02:41:48.960 align:start position:0%
chair just explained so uh I think this
 
02:41:50.910 --> 02:41:50.920 align:start position:0%

02:41:53.389 --> 02:41:53.399 align:start position:0%

02:41:55.550 --> 02:41:55.560 align:start position:0%

Celli yes just procedurally as as a
 
03:07:19.990 --> 03:07:20.000 align:start position:0%
relatively new person I never I never
 
03:07:21.630 --> 03:07:21.640 align:start position:0%
heard the Speaker of the House making a

me if that's happened before I'm just
 
03:07:27.110 --> 03:07:27.120 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
03:07:31.269 --> 03:07:31.279 align:start position:0%
learn the uh speaker uh always rules on
 
03:07:33.910 --> 03:07:33.920 align:start position:0%
germanness of amendments if there's a
 
03:07:36.150 --> 03:07:36.160 align:start position:0%
question and that is what he has
 
03:07:39.750 --> 03:07:39.760 align:start position:0%
done so that's been done before this
 
03:07:41.349 --> 03:07:41.359 align:start position:0%
last year I missed it I guess not in
 
03:07:41.359 --> 03:07:42.110 align:start position:0%
last year I missed it I guess not in
this

03:07:42.110 --> 03:07:42.120 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:07:42.120 --> 03:07:44.309 align:start position:0%
this
committee

03:07:44.309 --> 03:07:44.319 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:07:47.830 --> 03:07:47.840 align:start position:0%
in the house the uh speaker rules on
 
03:07:49.910 --> 03:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
whether bills are gerain or not when
 
03:07:53.269 --> 03:07:53.279 align:start position:0%
there is a question as to that fact so
 
03:07:56.190 --> 03:07:56.200 align:start position:0%
we will proceed with the vote and um
 
03:07:57.550 --> 03:07:57.560 align:start position:0%
it's just hard to it's just hard to
 
03:07:59.190 --> 03:07:59.200 align:start position:0%
believe given the fact that they both
 
03:08:01.830 --> 03:08:01.840 align:start position:0%
amend the same section of the statute
 
03:08:01.840 --> 03:08:03.190 align:start position:0%
amend the same section of the statute
193

03:08:03.190 --> 03:08:03.200 align:start position:0%
193
 
03:08:07.590 --> 03:08:07.600 align:start position:0%
E2 there was certainly um uh the need
 
03:08:11.590 --> 03:08:11.600 align:start position:0%
for a public hearing on uh the amendment
 
03:08:15.309 --> 03:08:15.319 align:start position:0%
um there was no uh fiscal note for the
 
03:08:19.349 --> 03:08:19.359 align:start position:0%
bill and this amendment provided that so
 
03:08:23.870 --> 03:08:23.880 align:start position:0%
I will call on the um clerk to call the
 
03:08:28.790 --> 03:08:28.800 align:start position:0%
role on the o passes amended
 
03:08:31.269 --> 03:08:31.279 align:start position:0%
motion point of
 
03:08:34.269 --> 03:08:34.279 align:start position:0%
order yes is you just used the fiscal
 
03:08:38.190 --> 03:08:38.200 align:start position:0%
Noe as a as a re as a rationale to to
 
03:08:39.790 --> 03:08:39.800 align:start position:0%
call it non gerain is there a fiscal
 
03:08:42.510 --> 03:08:42.520 align:start position:0%
note on the um on the amendment that's
 
03:08:45.229 --> 03:08:45.239 align:start position:0%
being voted on now that was my comment
 
03:08:49.670 --> 03:08:49.680 align:start position:0%
the uh house Speaker just plainly stated
 
03:08:52.429 --> 03:08:52.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:54.510 --> 03:08:54.520 align:start position:0%
Germain well you're the chair and you
 
03:08:57.070 --> 03:08:57.080 align:start position:0%
used you just used the fiscal note as a
 
03:09:01.229 --> 03:09:01.239 align:start position:0%
rationale that was my time um clerk are
 
03:09:03.710 --> 03:09:03.720 align:start position:0%
you waiting for the RO Mr Mr chair I
 
03:09:05.510 --> 03:09:05.520 align:start position:0%
also object the fact that we weren't
 
03:09:08.510 --> 03:09:08.520 align:start position:0%
privy to the discussion with the speaker
 
03:09:11.389 --> 03:09:11.399 align:start position:0%
and with the clerk uh we had absolutely
 
03:09:13.630 --> 03:09:13.640 align:start position:0%
no input nor did we hear any of this
 
03:09:16.070 --> 03:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
discussion and that seems like as
 
03:09:17.950 --> 03:09:17.960 align:start position:0%
representatives and this affects all of
 
03:09:19.389 --> 03:09:19.399 align:start position:0%
us that that would be something that
 
03:09:20.389 --> 03:09:20.399 align:start position:0%
would be
 
03:09:24.830 --> 03:09:24.840 align:start position:0%

03:11:59.190 --> 03:11:59.200 align:start position:0%
requirement for School nurses to be

03:12:31.150 --> 03:12:31.160 align:start position:0%
um we've heard testimony that and I know
 
03:12:32.750 --> 03:12:32.760 align:start position:0%
personally there is a short of good
 
03:12:36.510 --> 03:12:36.520 align:start position:0%
nurses and let's and and schools are
 
03:12:38.870 --> 03:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
actually changing the definition so they
 
03:12:43.309 --> 03:12:43.319 align:start position:0%
can hire different people uh and even
 
03:12:47.830 --> 03:12:47.840 align:start position:0%
Public Public Health nurses so the thing
 
03:12:52.790 --> 03:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
is let's let the district and the doe
 
03:12:57.190 --> 03:12:57.200 align:start position:0%
make the criteria for what they want for
 
03:12:59.469 --> 03:12:59.479 align:start position:0%
their particular
 
03:13:02.429 --> 03:13:02.439 align:start position:0%
requirement the thing is we had a lot of
 
03:13:06.070 --> 03:13:06.080 align:start position:0%
discussion on nurses with an as degree
 
03:13:08.389 --> 03:13:08.399 align:start position:0%
or one with a BS
 
03:13:11.070 --> 03:13:11.080 align:start position:0%
degree you don't become a nurse from
 
03:13:13.990 --> 03:13:14.000 align:start position:0%
degrees you come become a Nerf nurse by
 
03:13:16.429 --> 03:13:16.439 align:start position:0%
taking a national test the
 
03:13:20.269 --> 03:13:20.279 align:start position:0%
nclex-rn test when you leave College
 
03:13:22.110 --> 03:13:22.120 align:start position:0%
either with a two-year degree or a BS
 
03:13:25.469 --> 03:13:25.479 align:start position:0%
degree you're an either ASN or BSN it's
 
03:13:27.389 --> 03:13:27.399 align:start position:0%
not an RN you have to take this
 
03:13:27.399 --> 03:13:28.710 align:start position:0%
not an RN you have to take this
nationalized

03:13:28.710 --> 03:13:28.720 align:start position:0%
nationalized
 
03:13:28.720 --> 03:13:30.309 align:start position:0%
nationalized

03:15:44.630 --> 03:15:44.640 align:start position:0%
in schools and outside of schools and
 
03:15:47.710 --> 03:15:47.720 align:start position:0%
that's very important for us the Dilemma
 
03:15:50.469 --> 03:15:50.479 align:start position:0%
that we have here is that again for the
 
03:15:52.670 --> 03:15:52.680 align:start position:0%
for those of you that are new to the
 
03:15:56.750 --> 03:15:56.760 align:start position:0%
committee uh this credentialing process
 
03:15:59.510 --> 03:15:59.520 align:start position:0%
that is currently in the law was one
 
03:16:02.150 --> 03:16:02.160 align:start position:0%
that has been developed over the years
 
03:16:06.110 --> 03:16:06.120 align:start position:0%
it did not come about uh uh overnight
 
03:16:08.830 --> 03:16:08.840 align:start position:0%
this was a long fought battle on the
 
03:16:11.590 --> 03:16:11.600 align:start position:0%
part of the current School nurses to
 
03:16:13.030 --> 03:16:13.040 align:start position:0%
have this credential
 
03:16:15.550 --> 03:16:15.560 align:start position:0%
in the law and
 
03:16:21.269 --> 03:16:21.279 align:start position:0%
to defeat this to remove this would be a
 
03:16:23.750 --> 03:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
non-recognition of the of the value of
 
03:16:25.590 --> 03:16:25.600 align:start position:0%
those nurses who have been F whove been
 
03:16:28.110 --> 03:16:28.120 align:start position:0%
fighting to get this credential in the
 
03:16:30.429 --> 03:16:30.439 align:start position:0%
law and I really would encourage you not
 
03:16:33.269 --> 03:16:33.279 align:start position:0%
to support this motion thank you thank
 
03:16:35.510 --> 03:16:35.520 align:start position:0%
you very much representative Miler uh
 
03:16:38.070 --> 03:16:38.080 align:start position:0%
who's next in the C
 
03:16:42.389 --> 03:16:42.399 align:start position:0%
uhan Tanner Tanner thank you Mr chair
 
03:16:44.990 --> 03:16:45.000 align:start position:0%
can you hear me all right now yeah thank
 
03:16:48.590 --> 03:16:48.600 align:start position:0%
you um I think it's a sad day uh when we
 
03:16:50.429 --> 03:16:50.439 align:start position:0%
are ignoring the needs of those parents
 
03:16:52.710 --> 03:16:52.720 align:start position:0%
and their children who have complex
 
03:16:56.469 --> 03:16:56.479 align:start position:0%
medical issues have food insecurity
 
03:16:58.910 --> 03:16:58.920 align:start position:0%
homelessness mental and emotional issues
 
03:17:01.389 --> 03:17:01.399 align:start position:0%
or face life-threatening emergency
 
03:17:03.910 --> 03:17:03.920 align:start position:0%
situations in the isolation of a public
 
03:17:07.710 --> 03:17:07.720 align:start position:0%
school without a certified school nurse
 
03:17:09.110 --> 03:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
parents want their children to get
 
03:17:11.870 --> 03:17:11.880 align:start position:0%
urgent care and be safe they want their
 
03:17:14.269 --> 03:17:14.279 align:start position:0%
children regardless of special needs to
 
03:17:16.429 --> 03:17:16.439 align:start position:0%
be able to attend our public school with
 
03:17:16.439 --> 03:17:17.830 align:start position:0%
be able to attend our public school with
their

03:17:17.830 --> 03:17:17.840 align:start position:0%
their
 
03:17:20.830 --> 03:17:20.840 align:start position:0%
peers this bill is about repealing the
 
03:17:23.510 --> 03:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
requirement for specific knowledge and
 
03:17:26.349 --> 03:17:26.359 align:start position:0%
experience that the New Hampshire Nurses
 
03:17:28.590 --> 03:17:28.600 align:start position:0%
Association and the New Hampshire school
 
03:17:28.600 --> 03:17:29.750 align:start position:0%
Association and the New Hampshire school
Nurses

03:17:29.750 --> 03:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
Nurses
 
03:17:31.990 --> 03:17:32.000 align:start position:0%
Association strongly believe are
 
03:17:34.630 --> 03:17:34.640 align:start position:0%
necessary to provide consistent
 
03:17:37.110 --> 03:17:37.120 align:start position:0%
competent and quality care for our
 
03:17:39.630 --> 03:17:39.640 align:start position:0%
school children and for the safety
 
03:17:41.830 --> 03:17:41.840 align:start position:0%
health and well-being of the students
 
03:17:45.110 --> 03:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
their parents the teachers the staff and
 
03:17:48.309 --> 03:17:48.319 align:start position:0%
the communities at our Public Schools
 
03:17:50.790 --> 03:17:50.800 align:start position:0%
the real message here is that parents of
 
03:17:53.150 --> 03:17:53.160 align:start position:0%
school children want the best medical
 
03:17:55.630 --> 03:17:55.640 align:start position:0%
care and safety for their child during
 
03:17:58.630 --> 03:17:58.640 align:start position:0%
the many hours they spend at school for
 
03:18:00.550 --> 03:18:00.560 align:start position:0%
the safety and well-being of our school
 
03:18:03.510 --> 03:18:03.520 align:start position:0%
children I will vote no for the third
 
03:18:05.830 --> 03:18:05.840 align:start position:0%
time on this bill to take away the
 
03:18:08.309 --> 03:18:08.319 align:start position:0%
certification for School nurses thank
 
03:18:16.870 --> 03:18:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:19.910 --> 03:18:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:24.710 --> 03:18:24.720 align:start position:0%
don't okay not seeing any we'll go ahead
 
03:18:28.590 --> 03:18:28.600 align:start position:0%
has his hand up repr okay thank you
 
03:18:31.229 --> 03:18:31.239 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh I just wantan to I
 
03:18:32.750 --> 03:18:32.760 align:start position:0%
just want to Echo what representative
 
03:18:34.429 --> 03:18:34.439 align:start position:0%
Tanner has said I mean I'm new to the
 
03:18:36.590 --> 03:18:36.600 align:start position:0%
committee so I don't understand all of
 
03:18:38.590 --> 03:18:38.600 align:start position:0%
the perhaps all of the nuances of the
 
03:18:38.600 --> 03:18:39.870 align:start position:0%
the perhaps all of the nuances of the
issue

03:18:39.870 --> 03:18:39.880 align:start position:0%
issue
 
03:18:42.309 --> 03:18:42.319 align:start position:0%
particularly of uh all the past
 
03:18:44.150 --> 03:18:44.160 align:start position:0%
iterations but it does seem to me there
 
03:18:46.630 --> 03:18:46.640 align:start position:0%
has to be a significant and substant
 
03:18:48.630 --> 03:18:48.640 align:start position:0%
some sort of substantive difference
 
03:18:51.990 --> 03:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
between a BSN and the associates I
 
03:18:54.349 --> 03:18:54.359 align:start position:0%
understand that in both cases they take
 
03:18:56.150 --> 03:18:56.160 align:start position:0%
the same test in order to become a
 
03:18:56.160 --> 03:18:57.710 align:start position:0%
the same test in order to become a
registered

03:18:57.710 --> 03:18:57.720 align:start position:0%
registered
 
03:19:00.710 --> 03:19:00.720 align:start position:0%
nurse but I think that uh the goal and
 
03:19:03.349 --> 03:19:03.359 align:start position:0%
the the the responsibilities of the
 
03:19:05.910 --> 03:19:05.920 align:start position:0%
school nurse are obviously those of an
 
03:19:08.790 --> 03:19:08.800 align:start position:0%
RN but they also Encompass many broader
 
03:19:12.429 --> 03:19:12.439 align:start position:0%
issues particularly public health issues
 
03:19:14.750 --> 03:19:14.760 align:start position:0%
uh food issues mental and emotional
 
03:19:16.830 --> 03:19:16.840 align:start position:0%
health and well-being and these are the
 
03:19:18.630 --> 03:19:18.640 align:start position:0%
kinds of issues that are dealt with
 
03:19:21.950 --> 03:19:21.960 align:start position:0%
through the BSN uh program as opposed to
 
03:19:24.030 --> 03:19:24.040 align:start position:0%
the associates which tends to focus more
 
03:19:27.830 --> 03:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
on the immediate and clinical um and so
 
03:19:30.229 --> 03:19:30.239 align:start position:0%
I don't understand why we are walking
 
03:19:32.630 --> 03:19:32.640 align:start position:0%
back from this I have heard no
 
03:19:35.870 --> 03:19:35.880 align:start position:0%
particular compelling reason uh why we
 
03:19:37.710 --> 03:19:37.720 align:start position:0%
are walking back from this the only
 
03:19:40.590 --> 03:19:40.600 align:start position:0%
reason I seem to discern here is a
 
03:19:42.750 --> 03:19:42.760 align:start position:0%
desire and a hope
 
03:19:45.910 --> 03:19:45.920 align:start position:0%
on the part of some to save money on
 
03:19:48.070 --> 03:19:48.080 align:start position:0%
this that's the only reason I can
 
03:19:51.389 --> 03:19:51.399 align:start position:0%
discern um because the nurses themselves
 
03:19:53.550 --> 03:19:53.560 align:start position:0%
are in support of maintaining the
 
03:19:55.990 --> 03:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
credentialing as it currently exists and
 
03:19:58.110 --> 03:19:58.120 align:start position:0%
helped play a major role in designing
 
03:20:01.229 --> 03:20:01.239 align:start position:0%
the credentialing so I'm sorry that um
 
03:20:03.630 --> 03:20:03.640 align:start position:0%
the committee seems to be moving towards
 
03:20:05.590 --> 03:20:05.600 align:start position:0%
um adopting what they believe would be a
 
03:20:08.550 --> 03:20:08.560 align:start position:0%
cost saving measure um which could be
 
03:20:10.510 --> 03:20:10.520 align:start position:0%
potentially and I hope it never comes to
 
03:20:12.950 --> 03:20:12.960 align:start position:0%
pass um at the expense of the children
 
03:20:14.750 --> 03:20:14.760 align:start position:0%
for whom the nurses are responsible
 
03:20:16.309 --> 03:20:16.319 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much
 
03:20:20.269 --> 03:20:20.279 align:start position:0%

there okay uh not seeing any other
 
03:20:29.590 --> 03:20:29.600 align:start position:0%
further discussion or comments uh we'll
 
03:20:33.950 --> 03:20:33.960 align:start position:0%
move into the uh taking action on on
 
03:20:38.990 --> 03:20:39.000 align:start position:0%
this bill and so uh 349 a bill relative
 
03:20:40.750 --> 03:20:40.760 align:start position:0%
to certification requirements for school
 
03:20:44.510 --> 03:20:44.520 align:start position:0%

Manchester New Hampshire so you can see
 
04:41:36.030 --> 04:41:36.040 align:start position:0%
I am a product of public parochial and
 
04:41:38.670 --> 04:41:38.680 align:start position:0%
secular schools and for the record my
 
04:41:41.150 --> 04:41:41.160 align:start position:0%
children attend the local public school
 
04:41:42.750 --> 04:41:42.760 align:start position:0%
in Deerfield New Hampshire where I
 
04:41:42.760 --> 04:41:44.270 align:start position:0%
in Deerfield New Hampshire where I
currently

04:41:44.270 --> 04:41:44.280 align:start position:0%
currently
 
04:41:47.510 --> 04:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
live House Bill 607 is relative to
 
04:41:47.520 --> 04:41:48.470 align:start position:0%
live House Bill 607 is relative to
public

04:41:48.470 --> 04:41:48.480 align:start position:0%
public
 
04:41:51.190 --> 04:41:51.200 align:start position:0%
education and before we can discuss
 
04:41:53.750 --> 04:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
public education we should Define what
 
04:41:57.070 --> 04:41:57.080 align:start position:0%
public education is public education in
 
04:41:59.510 --> 04:41:59.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire means that each local
 
04:42:02.110 --> 04:42:02.120 align:start position:0%
community has an obligation to educate
 
04:42:05.550 --> 04:42:05.560 align:start position:0%
the children in their community
 
04:42:08.350 --> 04:42:08.360 align:start position:0%
inherent in this responsibility is the
 
04:42:11.070 --> 04:42:11.080 align:start position:0%
Public Funding for the education of all
 
04:42:11.080 --> 04:42:12.270 align:start position:0%
Public Funding for the education of all
local

04:42:12.270 --> 04:42:12.280 align:start position:0%
local
 
04:42:14.868 --> 04:42:14.878 align:start position:0%
children so when we speak of public
 
04:42:17.110 --> 04:42:17.120 align:start position:0%
education we are speaking of who is
 
04:42:20.070 --> 04:42:20.080 align:start position:0%
responsible for financing that
 
04:42:21.990 --> 04:42:22.000 align:start position:0%
education that is what today's
 
04:42:26.510 --> 04:42:26.520 align:start position:0%
discussion is all about it's not about
 
04:42:28.868 --> 04:42:28.878 align:start position:0%
the where the community will provide the
 
04:42:31.990 --> 04:42:32.000 align:start position:0%
education it is not about how the educa
 
04:42:34.030 --> 04:42:34.040 align:start position:0%
the community will provide the education
 
04:42:35.070 --> 04:42:35.080 align:start position:0%
but rather
 
04:42:36.510 --> 04:42:36.520 align:start position:0%
how they will fund
 
04:42:39.310 --> 04:42:39.320 align:start position:0%
it this should not be a discussion about
 
04:42:41.190 --> 04:42:41.200 align:start position:0%
this school or that school or this
 
04:42:43.868 --> 04:42:43.878 align:start position:0%
method versus that method those things
 
04:42:46.830 --> 04:42:46.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:48.830 --> 04:42:48.840 align:start position:0%
conversation before we get into the
 
04:42:50.670 --> 04:42:50.680 align:start position:0%
particular details of this bill I want
 
04:42:53.430 --> 04:42:53.440 align:start position:0%
to I want you to consider the
 
04:42:56.590 --> 04:42:56.600 align:start position:0%
following there are no public schools in
 
04:42:56.600 --> 04:42:58.110 align:start position:0%
following there are no public schools in
New

04:42:58.110 --> 04:42:58.120 align:start position:0%
New
 
04:43:00.510 --> 04:43:00.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that's right there are no
 
04:43:03.708 --> 04:43:03.718 align:start position:0%
public schools in New Hampshire what we
 
04:43:07.310 --> 04:43:07.320 align:start position:0%
have is large number of private schools
 
04:43:09.990 --> 04:43:10.000 align:start position:0%
that have been granted unilateral claim
 
04:43:12.310 --> 04:43:12.320 align:start position:0%
to public education
 
04:43:15.430 --> 04:43:15.440 align:start position:0%
monies let's consider my hometown of
 
04:43:17.708 --> 04:43:17.718 align:start position:0%
Deerfield as a case and
 
04:43:21.030 --> 04:43:21.040 align:start position:0%
point the Deerfield Community School our
 
04:43:24.270 --> 04:43:24.280 align:start position:0%
local public school is not really a
 
04:43:27.390 --> 04:43:27.400 align:start position:0%
public school it is not available to the
 
04:43:30.910 --> 04:43:30.920 align:start position:0%
general public it is in fact a private
 
04:43:33.470 --> 04:43:33.480 align:start position:0%
school for children that live in
 
04:43:36.510 --> 04:43:36.520 align:start position:0%
Deerfield if your child does not reside
 
04:43:39.708 --> 04:43:39.718 align:start position:0%
in Deerfield it is all but impossible
 
04:43:41.590 --> 04:43:41.600 align:start position:0%
for your child to attend the Deerfield
 
04:43:41.600 --> 04:43:43.030 align:start position:0%
for your child to attend the Deerfield
Community

04:43:43.030 --> 04:43:43.040 align:start position:0%
Community
 
04:43:45.430 --> 04:43:45.440 align:start position:0%
School Deerfield is a small school
 
04:43:48.350 --> 04:43:48.360 align:start position:0%
district we only have the one school so
 
04:43:50.510 --> 04:43:50.520 align:start position:0%
it would be fair to suggest that it does
 
04:43:52.628 --> 04:43:52.638 align:start position:0%
not provide sufficient evidence of the
 
04:43:55.430 --> 04:43:55.440 align:start position:0%
previous claim fair enough so let us
 
04:43:57.750 --> 04:43:57.760 align:start position:0%
consider a larger Public School District
 
04:44:00.708 --> 04:44:00.718 align:start position:0%
such as conquer Manchester Nash
 
04:44:03.990 --> 04:44:04.000 align:start position:0%
Etc many school districts have more than
 
04:44:07.150 --> 04:44:07.160 align:start position:0%
one and often several schools that teach
 
04:44:09.430 --> 04:44:09.440 align:start position:0%
the same grade levels within their
 
04:44:09.440 --> 04:44:10.910 align:start position:0%
the same grade levels within their
Community

04:44:10.910 --> 04:44:10.920 align:start position:0%
Community
 
04:44:14.030 --> 04:44:14.040 align:start position:0%
boundaries but those schools each
 
04:44:16.190 --> 04:44:16.200 align:start position:0%
providing an education for children of
 
04:44:18.948 --> 04:44:18.958 align:start position:0%
the same grade levels are not freely
 
04:44:20.990 --> 04:44:21.000 align:start position:0%
available to all the children in the
 
04:44:23.788 --> 04:44:23.798 align:start position:0%
community that currently use those
 
04:44:27.550 --> 04:44:27.560 align:start position:0%
grades children must attend the school
 
04:44:29.948 --> 04:44:29.958 align:start position:0%
in their District assigned to them based
 
04:44:31.430 --> 04:44:31.440 align:start position:0%
on the child's home
 
04:44:34.150 --> 04:44:34.160 align:start position:0%
address so if you live in Manchester and
 
04:44:35.830 --> 04:44:35.840 align:start position:0%
you live on the west side and you want
 
04:44:37.510 --> 04:44:37.520 align:start position:0%
to send your child to the beach Street
 
04:44:39.470 --> 04:44:39.480 align:start position:0%
Elementary School you can't do that the
 
04:44:41.510 --> 04:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
Beach Street Elementary School is for
 
04:44:44.590 --> 04:44:44.600 align:start position:0%
children that live around Beach Street
 
04:44:47.350 --> 04:44:47.360 align:start position:0%
so um it's an important thing to keep in
 
04:44:49.230 --> 04:44:49.240 align:start position:0%
mind so those schools aren't really
 
04:44:51.350 --> 04:44:51.360 align:start position:0%
Public Schools those schools are private
 
04:44:54.390 --> 04:44:54.400 align:start position:0%
schools living in very specific and
 
04:44:54.400 --> 04:44:55.910 align:start position:0%
schools living in very specific and
limited

04:44:55.910 --> 04:44:55.920 align:start position:0%
limited
 
04:44:58.350 --> 04:44:58.360 align:start position:0%
areas it's an important notion to keep
 
04:44:58.360 --> 04:44:59.390 align:start position:0%
areas it's an important notion to keep
in

04:44:59.390 --> 04:44:59.400 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:45:02.708 --> 04:45:02.718 align:start position:0%
mind as as current and modern thinking
 
04:45:06.550 --> 04:45:06.560 align:start position:0%
on education is to provide that which is
 
04:45:09.670 --> 04:45:09.680 align:start position:0%
in the best interest of the student
 
04:45:11.070 --> 04:45:11.080 align:start position:0%
right that's current thinking and
 
04:45:13.868 --> 04:45:13.878 align:start position:0%
education is to to to provide that which
 
04:45:16.390 --> 04:45:16.400 align:start position:0%
is in the best interest of the
 
04:45:18.868 --> 04:45:18.878 align:start position:0%
student and it's hard to imagine that
 
04:45:21.150 --> 04:45:21.160 align:start position:0%
requiring attendance to a particular
 
04:45:24.948 --> 04:45:24.958 align:start position:0%
School based on a student's address will
 
04:45:27.628 --> 04:45:27.638 align:start position:0%
provide students with the education that
 
04:45:30.750 --> 04:45:30.760 align:start position:0%
is in their particular and individual
 
04:45:30.760 --> 04:45:32.868 align:start position:0%
is in their particular and individual
best

04:45:32.868 --> 04:45:32.878 align:start position:0%
best
 
04:45:35.030 --> 04:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
interest it's also also interesting to
 
04:45:37.350 --> 04:45:37.360 align:start position:0%
consider special education in this
 
04:45:39.350 --> 04:45:39.360 align:start position:0%
discussion children in the special
 
04:45:42.510 --> 04:45:42.520 align:start position:0%
education system each receive an IEP
 
04:45:45.910 --> 04:45:45.920 align:start position:0%
individualized education plan to ensure
 
04:45:47.430 --> 04:45:47.440 align:start position:0%
that the child receives an
 
04:45:49.550 --> 04:45:49.560 align:start position:0%
individualized education that is in the
 
04:45:51.990 --> 04:45:52.000 align:start position:0%
best interest of that
 
04:45:55.110 --> 04:45:55.120 align:start position:0%
student further those requiring the most
 
04:45:58.030 --> 04:45:58.040 align:start position:0%
specialized individual education plans
 
04:46:01.350 --> 04:46:01.360 align:start position:0%
are often sent to or tuition into
 
04:46:04.350 --> 04:46:04.360 align:start position:0%
private schools usually out of District
 
04:46:06.868 --> 04:46:06.878 align:start position:0%
that are capable of providing for the
 
04:46:10.070 --> 04:46:10.080 align:start position:0%
needs that are in that child's best
 
04:46:12.830 --> 04:46:12.840 align:start position:0%
interest so the concept in practice of
 
04:46:15.990 --> 04:46:16.000 align:start position:0%
using taxpayer education Monies to send
 
04:46:18.708 --> 04:46:18.718 align:start position:0%
students to private institutions for a
 
04:46:22.830 --> 04:46:22.840 align:start position:0%
public education is still a commonplace
 
04:46:26.350 --> 04:46:26.360 align:start position:0%
practice in fact my home of Deerfield
 
04:46:28.310 --> 04:46:28.320 align:start position:0%
has a public school for prek through
 
04:46:31.590 --> 04:46:31.600 align:start position:0%
grade eight we do not have a high
 
04:46:34.948 --> 04:46:34.958 align:start position:0%
school there is a high school in our sa
 
04:46:37.788 --> 04:46:37.798 align:start position:0%
our school administrative unit but the
 
04:46:40.270 --> 04:46:40.280 align:start position:0%
Deerfield School District does not send
 
04:46:43.750 --> 04:46:43.760 align:start position:0%
more than a few students there and they
 
04:46:45.788 --> 04:46:45.798 align:start position:0%
attend under special
 
04:46:48.430 --> 04:46:48.440 align:start position:0%
circumstances manifest hardship or best
 
04:46:49.628 --> 04:46:49.638 align:start position:0%
interest of the
 
04:46:52.548 --> 04:46:52.558 align:start position:0%
student we tuition all of our high
 
04:46:54.990 --> 04:46:55.000 align:start position:0%
school students out of district and out
 
04:46:57.628 --> 04:46:57.638 align:start position:0%
of ours to receive their secondary
 
04:47:00.190 --> 04:47:00.200 align:start position:0%
education so uh Deerfield has a contract
 
04:47:01.350 --> 04:47:01.360 align:start position:0%
with conquered high school with the
 
04:47:03.590 --> 04:47:03.600 align:start position:0%
conquered School District to educate um
 
04:47:05.670 --> 04:47:05.680 align:start position:0%
our high school
 
04:47:08.390 --> 04:47:08.400 align:start position:0%
students school choice is nothing and
 
04:47:09.830 --> 04:47:09.840 align:start position:0%
and that hasn't always been the case
 
04:47:11.350 --> 04:47:11.360 align:start position:0%
Deerfield has contracted with other
 
04:47:13.110 --> 04:47:13.120 align:start position:0%
schools in the past and had all kinds of
 
04:47:15.708 --> 04:47:15.718 align:start position:0%
different arrangements so school choice
 
04:47:18.190 --> 04:47:18.200 align:start position:0%
is nothing new what we're about to
 
04:47:20.830 --> 04:47:20.840 align:start position:0%
discuss is who should be allowed to make
 
04:47:23.470 --> 04:47:23.480 align:start position:0%
that decision who should get to make the
 
04:47:26.590 --> 04:47:26.600 align:start position:0%
choice for a particular student and
 
04:47:28.670 --> 04:47:28.680 align:start position:0%
that's what I hope we'll be discussing
 
04:47:32.470 --> 04:47:32.480 align:start position:0%
today so House Bill 607 establishing
 
04:47:35.030 --> 04:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
local savings accounts for students stud
 
04:47:36.670 --> 04:47:36.680 align:start position:0%
is enabling
 
04:47:39.590 --> 04:47:39.600 align:start position:0%
legislation in New Hampshire we value we
 
04:47:43.110 --> 04:47:43.120 align:start position:0%
treasure local control and have a long
 
04:47:44.910 --> 04:47:44.920 align:start position:0%
history of supporting legislation that
 
04:47:47.990 --> 04:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
grants our communities local control and
 
04:47:48.000 --> 04:47:49.830 align:start position:0%
grants our communities local control and
local

04:47:49.830 --> 04:47:49.840 align:start position:0%
local
 
04:47:52.430 --> 04:47:52.440 align:start position:0%
decisionmaking this bill grants local
 
04:47:55.070 --> 04:47:55.080 align:start position:0%
control to decide if local education
 
04:47:58.510 --> 04:47:58.520 align:start position:0%
monies should be allowed to follow the
 
04:48:01.150 --> 04:48:01.160 align:start position:0%
child the mechanisms contained within
 
04:48:04.070 --> 04:48:04.080 align:start position:0%
this bill already exist and can be found
 
04:48:06.310 --> 04:48:06.320 align:start position:0%
in existing
 
04:48:09.150 --> 04:48:09.160 align:start position:0%
rsas first the question is defined in
 
04:48:11.310 --> 04:48:11.320 align:start position:0%
the bill shall we adopt the provisions
 
04:48:12.590 --> 04:48:12.600 align:start position:0%
of RSA
 
04:48:16.030 --> 04:48:16.040 align:start position:0%
194e to allow the establishment of a
 
04:48:18.590 --> 04:48:18.600 align:start position:0%
local education Freedom savings account
 
04:48:21.110 --> 04:48:21.120 align:start position:0%
program in name the
 
04:48:23.390 --> 04:48:23.400 align:start position:0%
district this ensures that the question
 
04:48:25.830 --> 04:48:25.840 align:start position:0%
is stated clearly and concisely and
 
04:48:27.670 --> 04:48:27.680 align:start position:0%
cannot be altered for any
 
04:48:30.708 --> 04:48:30.718 align:start position:0%
reason the repeal language is also
 
04:48:32.948 --> 04:48:32.958 align:start position:0%
defined in the bill shall we resend the
 
04:48:36.030 --> 04:48:36.040 align:start position:0%
provisions of RSA 194e is adopted by the
 
04:48:38.628 --> 04:48:38.638 align:start position:0%
local put in your school district on the
 
04:48:40.750 --> 04:48:40.760 align:start position:0%
date of the adoption so that a local
 
04:48:42.510 --> 04:48:42.520 align:start position:0%
education Freedom savings account
 
04:48:45.150 --> 04:48:45.160 align:start position:0%
program will no will no longer be used
 
04:48:46.350 --> 04:48:46.360 align:start position:0%
in the
 
04:48:48.948 --> 04:48:48.958 align:start position:0%
district so it's not a one-way Street
 
04:48:50.670 --> 04:48:50.680 align:start position:0%
this is this is for a community to be
 
04:48:53.628 --> 04:48:53.638 align:start position:0%
able to decide to opt in to this program
 
04:48:55.590 --> 04:48:55.600 align:start position:0%
as well as subsequently potentially opt
 
04:48:58.750 --> 04:48:58.760 align:start position:0%
out in the future the enactment or
 
04:49:02.270 --> 04:49:02.280 align:start position:0%
repeal requires a 35ths 60% super
 
04:49:05.190 --> 04:49:05.200 align:start position:0%
majority vote in the affirmative by the
 
04:49:05.200 --> 04:49:06.270 align:start position:0%
majority vote in the affirmative by the
local

04:49:06.270 --> 04:49:06.280 align:start position:0%
local
 
04:49:08.830 --> 04:49:08.840 align:start position:0%
voters this sets a reasonable threshold
 
04:49:11.350 --> 04:49:11.360 align:start position:0%
for a community to make this decision
 
04:49:13.310 --> 04:49:13.320 align:start position:0%
and it is a threshold that is used in
 
04:49:15.390 --> 04:49:15.400 align:start position:0%
other existing ballot measures already
 
04:49:17.110 --> 04:49:17.120 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire
 
04:49:19.948 --> 04:49:19.958 align:start position:0%
RSA so if you're familiar with what's
 
04:49:22.670 --> 04:49:22.680 align:start position:0%
commonly referred to as sb2 versus
 
04:49:25.190 --> 04:49:25.200 align:start position:0%
traditional town meeting right this this
 
04:49:27.590 --> 04:49:27.600 align:start position:0%
is the same mechanism that a community
 
04:49:30.190 --> 04:49:30.200 align:start position:0%
would use to decide uh whether to
 
04:49:32.030 --> 04:49:32.040 align:start position:0%
transition from traditional town meeting
 
04:49:34.990 --> 04:49:35.000 align:start position:0%
to sb2 form of government or to
 
04:49:37.110 --> 04:49:37.120 align:start position:0%
transition from sb2 form of government
 
04:49:40.270 --> 04:49:40.280 align:start position:0%
back to traditional um town meeting so
 
04:49:42.230 --> 04:49:42.240 align:start position:0%
there there's no precedence really for
 
04:49:43.750 --> 04:49:43.760 align:start position:0%
for this
 
04:49:45.990 --> 04:49:46.000 align:start position:0%
mechanism the threshold to place the
 
04:49:48.310 --> 04:49:48.320 align:start position:0%
question on the ballot is low and this
 
04:49:52.150 --> 04:49:52.160 align:start position:0%
is by Design to ensure easy access to
 
04:49:53.628 --> 04:49:53.638 align:start position:0%
enabling local
 
04:49:56.708 --> 04:49:56.718 align:start position:0%
control again these thresholds already
 
04:49:59.990 --> 04:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
exist in other statutes there is no
 
04:50:02.830 --> 04:50:02.840 align:start position:0%
value in setting the bar artificially
 
04:50:05.590 --> 04:50:05.600 align:start position:0%
High uh a barrier to access to a clear
 
04:50:07.590 --> 04:50:07.600 align:start position:0%
and succinct question to discern the
 
04:50:10.150 --> 04:50:10.160 align:start position:0%
will of the people on such a matter and
 
04:50:11.868 --> 04:50:11.878 align:start position:0%
so if you're looking for a reference of
 
04:50:14.110 --> 04:50:14.120 align:start position:0%
where this may already exist in law if
 
04:50:17.350 --> 04:50:17.360 align:start position:0%
you look at uh the statutes around uh
 
04:50:19.548 --> 04:50:19.558 align:start position:0%
citizen petitioned warrant articles uh
 
04:50:21.470 --> 04:50:21.480 align:start position:0%
you'll see that the thresholds are very
 
04:50:24.750 --> 04:50:24.760 align:start position:0%
similar to that existing RSA again um
 
04:50:26.390 --> 04:50:26.400 align:start position:0%
we're not really setting precedent with
 
04:50:28.270 --> 04:50:28.280 align:start position:0%
that with that
 
04:50:31.110 --> 04:50:31.120 align:start position:0%
mechanism so now the question is what
 
04:50:34.788 --> 04:50:34.798 align:start position:0%
exactly is on the table this
 
04:50:40.628 --> 04:50:40.638 align:start position:0%
bill simply stated allows a grant of 85%
 
04:50:44.390 --> 04:50:44.400 align:start position:0%
of local regular education monies plus
 
04:50:46.788 --> 04:50:46.798 align:start position:0%
90% of State monies specifically the
 
04:50:49.430 --> 04:50:49.440 align:start position:0%
state adequacy Grant and differentiated
 
04:50:53.628 --> 04:50:53.638 align:start position:0%
Aid to follow the child in a district
 
04:50:57.628 --> 04:50:57.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:01.030 --> 04:51:01.040 align:start position:0%
program as with current state adequacy
 
04:51:03.350 --> 04:51:03.360 align:start position:0%
grants and other state funding into
 
04:51:06.510 --> 04:51:06.520 align:start position:0%
local school districts the calculation
 
04:51:09.390 --> 04:51:09.400 align:start position:0%
of the grant this grant the local Grant
 
04:51:11.788 --> 04:51:11.798 align:start position:0%
is based on the previous year's School
 
04:51:14.470 --> 04:51:14.480 align:start position:0%
District budget and student population
 
04:51:17.910 --> 04:51:17.920 align:start position:0%
so it lags a year right just like most
 
04:51:20.070 --> 04:51:20.080 align:start position:0%
of the state funding to the
 
04:51:22.948 --> 04:51:22.958 align:start position:0%
schools the reason for this is to allow
 
04:51:25.670 --> 04:51:25.680 align:start position:0%
for the budgeting of the grant amount in
 
04:51:28.590 --> 04:51:28.600 align:start position:0%
anticipation of the school year it is
 
04:51:31.230 --> 04:51:31.240 align:start position:0%
granted and so what that does is it
 
04:51:33.750 --> 04:51:33.760 align:start position:0%
allows um a school board a school
 
04:51:36.548 --> 04:51:36.558 align:start position:0%
District to know what the number is for
 
04:51:38.948 --> 04:51:38.958 align:start position:0%
the coming year so they can add that in
 
04:51:41.030 --> 04:51:41.040 align:start position:0%
their in their coming budgets it it
 
04:51:43.510 --> 04:51:43.520 align:start position:0%
gives them transparency um of what's
 
04:51:43.520 --> 04:51:44.430 align:start position:0%
gives them transparency um of what's
coming

04:51:44.430 --> 04:51:44.440 align:start position:0%
coming
 
04:51:48.670 --> 04:51:48.680 align:start position:0%
up the grant is calculated as follows
 
04:51:51.070 --> 04:51:51.080 align:start position:0%
all local monies raised by
 
04:51:54.750 --> 04:51:54.760 align:start position:0%
taxation minus all special education
 
04:51:57.470 --> 04:51:57.480 align:start position:0%
spending so special ed is special ed
 
04:51:59.230 --> 04:51:59.240 align:start position:0%
spending at the local level is
 
04:52:01.628 --> 04:52:01.638 align:start position:0%
completely carved out of this this bill
 
04:52:04.230 --> 04:52:04.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't do anything to touch local
 
04:52:11.030 --> 04:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
special ed um monies okay um so it's uh
 
04:52:13.390 --> 04:52:13.400 align:start position:0%
local monies raised by taxation minus
 
04:52:16.470 --> 04:52:16.480 align:start position:0%
special ed from the previous year
 
04:52:19.910 --> 04:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
divided by the previous year's average
 
04:52:21.868 --> 04:52:21.878 align:start position:0%
daily membership and attendance and
 
04:52:24.230 --> 04:52:24.240 align:start position:0%
that's a a population number uh
 
04:52:27.070 --> 04:52:27.080 align:start position:0%
published by the State Department of
 
04:52:30.430 --> 04:52:30.440 align:start position:0%
Education and then multiplied by 85%
 
04:52:34.150 --> 04:52:34.160 align:start position:0%
that gives the per pupil Grant
 
04:52:35.628 --> 04:52:35.638 align:start position:0%
this allows for school districts and
 
04:52:37.350 --> 04:52:37.360 align:start position:0%
boards to be able to anticipate and
 
04:52:39.270 --> 04:52:39.280 align:start position:0%
budget for the program when crafting
 
04:52:42.070 --> 04:52:42.080 align:start position:0%
their budget it provides them a dollar
 
04:52:44.750 --> 04:52:44.760 align:start position:0%
value certain per
 
04:52:48.750 --> 04:52:48.760 align:start position:0%
student 85% of locally raised regular
 
04:52:50.910 --> 04:52:50.920 align:start position:0%
education funding would be available to
 
04:52:53.470 --> 04:52:53.480 align:start position:0%
follow the child that chooses to enroll
 
04:52:55.910 --> 04:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
in the program and
 
04:52:58.510 --> 04:52:58.520 align:start position:0%
15% remains with the
 
04:53:01.110 --> 04:53:01.120 align:start position:0%
district again special money special
 
04:53:02.868 --> 04:53:02.878 align:start position:0%
education monies are left intact and
 
04:53:06.150 --> 04:53:06.160 align:start position:0%
untouched Federal monies are also left
 
04:53:08.430 --> 04:53:08.440 align:start position:0%
intact and
 
04:53:11.150 --> 04:53:11.160 align:start position:0%
untouched a student enrolled in this
 
04:53:13.150 --> 04:53:13.160 align:start position:0%
program would no longer be counted in
 
04:53:14.788 --> 04:53:14.798 align:start position:0%
the average daily membership and
 
04:53:14.798 --> 04:53:16.070 align:start position:0%
the average daily membership and
attendance

04:53:16.070 --> 04:53:16.080 align:start position:0%
attendance
 
04:53:18.868 --> 04:53:18.878 align:start position:0%
calculation and therefore All State
 
04:53:21.230 --> 04:53:21.240 align:start position:0%
monies associated with that child would
 
04:53:22.990 --> 04:53:23.000 align:start position:0%
cease to flow to the local school
 
04:53:25.670 --> 04:53:25.680 align:start position:0%
district after the first year of the
 
04:53:27.788 --> 04:53:27.798 align:start position:0%
student's participation in the
 
04:53:31.270 --> 04:53:31.280 align:start position:0%
program for that reason this bill also
 
04:53:33.910 --> 04:53:33.920 align:start position:0%
allows 90% of the state adequacy Grant
 
04:53:36.390 --> 04:53:36.400 align:start position:0%
and differentiated Aid to follow the
 
04:53:39.190 --> 04:53:39.200 align:start position:0%
student so if a community enables this
 
04:53:42.390 --> 04:53:42.400 align:start position:0%
program and a child avails themselves of
 
04:53:45.350 --> 04:53:45.360 align:start position:0%
the program once they leave the district
 
04:53:48.350 --> 04:53:48.360 align:start position:0%
the state money would go away anyway so
 
04:53:50.708 --> 04:53:50.718 align:start position:0%
there's no sense to just allow the state
 
04:53:53.310 --> 04:53:53.320 align:start position:0%
money to follow the
 
04:53:56.310 --> 04:53:56.320 align:start position:0%
student so let us place this into um
 
04:53:56.320 --> 04:53:57.270 align:start position:0%
student so let us place this into um
some

04:53:57.270 --> 04:53:57.280 align:start position:0%
some
 
04:54:00.070 --> 04:54:00.080 align:start position:0%
context the Deerfield School District's

04:55:04.110 --> 04:55:04.120 align:start position:0%
district the first year Grant for each
 
04:55:07.628 --> 04:55:07.638 align:start position:0%
student sets a minimum Grant threshold
 
04:55:08.788 --> 04:55:08.798 align:start position:0%
for the
 
04:55:11.990 --> 04:55:12.000 align:start position:0%
student so the grant amount is calcul
 
04:55:13.390 --> 04:55:13.400 align:start position:0%
well let me just go with the script
 
04:55:15.628 --> 04:55:15.638 align:start position:0%
because I'll repeat myself this provides
 
04:55:18.110 --> 04:55:18.120 align:start position:0%
families with a minimum threshold dollar
 
04:55:21.070 --> 04:55:21.080 align:start position:0%
amount so that families can also plan
 
04:55:24.190 --> 04:55:24.200 align:start position:0%
and budget for the future with a minimum
 
04:55:27.150 --> 04:55:27.160 align:start position:0%
amount of certainty so they once they
 
04:55:28.910 --> 04:55:28.920 align:start position:0%
have that dollar amount they'll never
 
04:55:31.350 --> 04:55:31.360 align:start position:0%
fall below that the grant amount is
 
04:55:33.990 --> 04:55:34.000 align:start position:0%
recalculated annually and and may
 
04:55:36.830 --> 04:55:36.840 align:start position:0%
increase or decrease year toe so there's
 
04:55:39.030 --> 04:55:39.040 align:start position:0%
a certain amount of float but a
 
04:55:41.548 --> 04:55:41.558 align:start position:0%
particular student's Grant will never
 
04:55:43.868 --> 04:55:43.878 align:start position:0%
drop below the dollar amount of the
 
04:55:47.430 --> 04:55:47.440 align:start position:0%
firste grant so the first year Grant
 
04:55:51.708 --> 04:55:51.718 align:start position:0%
sets a minimum threshold for that child
 
04:55:54.510 --> 04:55:54.520 align:start position:0%
so that the family has a minimum number
 
04:55:57.590 --> 04:55:57.600 align:start position:0%
that they can budget and and plan
 
04:56:01.670 --> 04:56:01.680 align:start position:0%
with further if a community repeals the
 
04:56:03.868 --> 04:56:03.878 align:start position:0%
program at some point
 
04:56:06.270 --> 04:56:06.280 align:start position:0%
all participating students are
 
04:56:09.548 --> 04:56:09.558 align:start position:0%
grandfathered in until they no longer
 
04:56:12.070 --> 04:56:12.080 align:start position:0%
meet the requirements of participation
 
04:56:14.070 --> 04:56:14.080 align:start position:0%
is stipulated in the
 
04:56:17.750 --> 04:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
bill this is intended to Simply provide
 
04:56:20.190 --> 04:56:20.200 align:start position:0%
families with some certainty after
 
04:56:22.830 --> 04:56:22.840 align:start position:0%
freely choosing to enter into such a
 
04:56:25.910 --> 04:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
program it does not seem fair to me to
 
04:56:27.910 --> 04:56:27.920 align:start position:0%
pull the rug out from under a student
 
04:56:30.830 --> 04:56:30.840 align:start position:0%
that has chosen an alternative path so
 
04:56:33.430 --> 04:56:33.440 align:start position:0%
if a community enacts it and a child
 
04:56:35.390 --> 04:56:35.400 align:start position:0%
avails the student avails himself of the
 
04:56:37.788 --> 04:56:37.798 align:start position:0%
program uh and the program gets repealed
 
04:56:39.270 --> 04:56:39.280 align:start position:0%
that child gets to follow it through
 
04:56:41.510 --> 04:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
until he graduate high school time out
 
04:56:45.070 --> 04:56:45.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:47.788 --> 04:56:47.798 align:start position:0%
district the bill has the potential to
 
04:56:51.070 --> 04:56:51.080 align:start position:0%
save District's money although that is
 
04:56:55.430 --> 04:56:55.440 align:start position:0%
not a reason it is not a purpose nor is
 
04:56:59.548 --> 04:56:59.558 align:start position:0%
it an objective of this bill this bill
 
04:57:02.390 --> 04:57:02.400 align:start position:0%
is to provide options to families for
 
04:57:04.510 --> 04:57:04.520 align:start position:0%
the best interest of
 
04:57:07.230 --> 04:57:07.240 align:start position:0%
students we likely will not know for
 
04:57:10.030 --> 04:57:10.040 align:start position:0%
several or many years after enactment if
 
04:57:12.390 --> 04:57:12.400 align:start position:0%
this model will save District's
 
04:57:15.948 --> 04:57:15.958 align:start position:0%
money but if families do not expend
 
04:57:17.990 --> 04:57:18.000 align:start position:0%
their entire Grant providing an
 
04:57:20.948 --> 04:57:20.958 align:start position:0%
education to their children then all
 
04:57:23.590 --> 04:57:23.600 align:start position:0%
monies remaining after the student is no
 
04:57:25.990 --> 04:57:26.000 align:start position:0%
longer eligible to participate in this
 
04:57:29.070 --> 04:57:29.080 align:start position:0%
program will be returned to the local
 
04:57:32.270 --> 04:57:32.280 align:start position:0%
school district so if we imagine a first
 
04:57:34.910 --> 04:57:34.920 align:start position:0%
grader going into to this program and
 
04:57:36.788 --> 04:57:36.798 align:start position:0%
staying in this program through high
 
04:57:39.510 --> 04:57:39.520 align:start position:0%
school and say on average they only
 
04:57:43.110 --> 04:57:43.120 align:start position:0%
spend 90% of their Grant every year uh
 
04:57:46.230 --> 04:57:46.240 align:start position:0%
the money that would acre over those 12
 
04:57:49.230 --> 04:57:49.240 align:start position:0%
years um would then revert back to the
 
04:57:51.310 --> 04:57:51.320 align:start position:0%
school district uh once the child
 
04:57:54.990 --> 04:57:55.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:57.708 --> 04:57:57.718 align:start position:0%
school a large part of the discussion on
 
04:57:58.788 --> 04:57:58.798 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
04:58:00.788 --> 04:58:00.798 align:start position:0%
20 which I
 
04:58:03.590 --> 04:58:03.600 align:start position:0%
support was that the grant would not be
 
04:58:06.670 --> 04:58:06.680 align:start position:0%
sufficient to allow lower income earners
 
04:58:10.628 --> 04:58:10.638 align:start position:0%
to access other educational
 
04:58:13.110 --> 04:58:13.120 align:start position:0%
options well I would pause it that every
 
04:58:16.430 --> 04:58:16.440 align:start position:0%
little bit helps to be sure this bill
 
04:58:19.310 --> 04:58:19.320 align:start position:0%
directly addresses that issue and would
 
04:58:22.230 --> 04:58:22.240 align:start position:0%
provide a grant sufficient to allow even
 
04:58:24.670 --> 04:58:24.680 align:start position:0%
the most economically challenged
 
04:58:28.390 --> 04:58:28.400 align:start position:0%
families to access a broad spectrum of
 
04:58:28.400 --> 04:58:30.670 align:start position:0%
families to access a broad spectrum of
alternative

04:58:30.670 --> 04:58:30.680 align:start position:0%
alternative
 
04:58:33.350 --> 04:58:33.360 align:start position:0%
opportunities that being said it would
 
04:58:36.190 --> 04:58:36.200 align:start position:0%
be a shame if the B if the debate on
 
04:58:38.430 --> 04:58:38.440 align:start position:0%
this bill devolved into a discussion of
 
04:58:38.440 --> 04:58:40.150 align:start position:0%
this bill devolved into a discussion of
class

04:58:40.150 --> 04:58:40.160 align:start position:0%
class
 
04:58:43.430 --> 04:58:43.440 align:start position:0%
conflict public education is providing
 
04:58:45.868 --> 04:58:45.878 align:start position:0%
the funding for the education of all
 
04:58:50.150 --> 04:58:50.160 align:start position:0%
children of a community using public
 
04:58:52.990 --> 04:58:53.000 align:start position:0%
resources all children should have the
 
04:58:56.548 --> 04:58:56.558 align:start position:0%
same and equal right to lay claim to an
 
04:58:59.110 --> 04:58:59.120 align:start position:0%
equal share of the publicly raised
 
04:59:02.070 --> 04:59:02.080 align:start position:0%
regular education funds regardless of
 
04:59:04.310 --> 04:59:04.320 align:start position:0%
their fames finan
 
04:59:07.590 --> 04:59:07.600 align:start position:0%
status after all we don't charge rich
 
04:59:10.310 --> 04:59:10.320 align:start position:0%
kids more money to attend a local public
 
04:59:13.310 --> 04:59:13.320 align:start position:0%
school we don't means test to be able to
 
04:59:15.350 --> 04:59:15.360 align:start position:0%
enroll in a local public
 
04:59:18.190 --> 04:59:18.200 align:start position:0%
school if the community chooses to allow
 
04:59:20.430 --> 04:59:20.440 align:start position:0%
local education Monies to follow the
 
04:59:24.270 --> 04:59:24.280 align:start position:0%
child why would we alter that fair and
 
04:59:28.750 --> 04:59:28.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:30.628 --> 04:59:30.638 align:start position:0%
contract there's been a lot of
 
04:59:32.510 --> 04:59:32.520 align:start position:0%
discussion relative to the expected
 
04:59:34.910 --> 04:59:34.920 align:start position:0%
effects of school choice on local school
 
04:59:37.868 --> 04:59:37.878 align:start position:0%
districts but let's consider some
 
04:59:41.230 --> 04:59:41.240 align:start position:0%
facts I believe that most families the
 
04:59:43.830 --> 04:59:43.840 align:start position:0%
vast majority of families prefer that
 
04:59:46.910 --> 04:59:46.920 align:start position:0%
their children attend the Local District
 
04:59:49.670 --> 04:59:49.680 align:start position:0%
school I believe that's true for a few
 
04:59:52.190 --> 04:59:52.200 align:start position:0%
reasons first and foremost most families
 
04:59:54.548 --> 04:59:54.558 align:start position:0%
want their children to be raised with a
 
04:59:57.628 --> 04:59:57.638 align:start position:0%
sense of community with a sense of local
 
05:00:00.190 --> 05:00:00.200 align:start position:0%
belonging and for their children to be
 
05:00:03.548 --> 05:00:03.558 align:start position:0%
connected to their community most
 
05:00:05.430 --> 05:00:05.440 align:start position:0%
families want their children to know
 
05:00:05.440 --> 05:00:06.190 align:start position:0%
families want their children to know
their

05:00:06.190 --> 05:00:06.200 align:start position:0%
their
 
05:00:08.910 --> 05:00:08.920 align:start position:0%
neighbors The Local District school is
 
05:00:11.350 --> 05:00:11.360 align:start position:0%
often the most efficient way of
 
05:00:12.948 --> 05:00:12.958 align:start position:0%
achieving this
 
05:00:15.750 --> 05:00:15.760 align:start position:0%
goal that is a reason most families want
 
05:00:17.788 --> 05:00:17.798 align:start position:0%
their children to attend the Local
 
05:00:21.830 --> 05:00:21.840 align:start position:0%
District school second is transportation
 
05:00:23.948 --> 05:00:23.958 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire we require district
 
05:00:25.390 --> 05:00:25.400 align:start position:0%
schools to provide student
 
05:00:27.628 --> 05:00:27.638 align:start position:0%
transportation to and from local
 
05:00:30.230 --> 05:00:30.240 align:start position:0%
district schools through grade
 
05:00:33.708 --> 05:00:33.718 align:start position:0%
8 this is not an insignificant benefit
 
05:00:36.150 --> 05:00:36.160 align:start position:0%
for most families attending their local
 
05:00:36.160 --> 05:00:37.150 align:start position:0%
for most families attending their local
District

05:00:37.150 --> 05:00:37.160 align:start position:0%
District
 
05:00:40.030 --> 05:00:40.040 align:start position:0%
school a family that chooses to leave
 
05:00:42.590 --> 05:00:42.600 align:start position:0%
the district for whatever reason
 
05:00:45.390 --> 05:00:45.400 align:start position:0%
independently or under this program
 
05:00:48.430 --> 05:00:48.440 align:start position:0%
would lose the benefit of free
 
05:00:50.750 --> 05:00:50.760 align:start position:0%
transportation for the sake of brevity
 
05:00:53.470 --> 05:00:53.480 align:start position:0%
lastly most families believe that their
 
05:00:55.868 --> 05:00:55.878 align:start position:0%
local District school provides a good
 
05:00:58.708 --> 05:00:58.718 align:start position:0%
education for their children why would a
 
05:01:01.150 --> 05:01:01.160 align:start position:0%
family choose to leave a local District
 
05:01:04.910 --> 05:01:04.920 align:start position:0%
school if their needs are already being
 
05:01:08.548 --> 05:01:08.558 align:start position:0%
met but the fact of the matter is no one
 
05:01:11.430 --> 05:01:11.440 align:start position:0%
school can provide what is in the best
 
05:01:13.910 --> 05:01:13.920 align:start position:0%
interest of every student in the
 
05:01:17.750 --> 05:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
district there is no one-size fit all
 
05:01:19.708 --> 05:01:19.718 align:start position:0%
for some students an alternate
 
05:01:21.990 --> 05:01:22.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity is in the best interest of
 
05:01:22.000 --> 05:01:22.948 align:start position:0%
opportunity is in the best interest of
the

05:01:22.948 --> 05:01:22.958 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:01:25.948 --> 05:01:25.958 align:start position:0%
student we should always strive for what
 
05:01:27.750 --> 05:01:27.760 align:start position:0%
is in the best interest to the
 
05:01:30.190 --> 05:01:30.200 align:start position:0%
student New Hampshire has some of the
 
05:01:32.470 --> 05:01:32.480 align:start position:0%
best public schools in the country no
 
05:01:34.470 --> 05:01:34.480 align:start position:0%
one refutes that
 
05:01:37.470 --> 05:01:37.480 align:start position:0%
fact but looking back at the data going
 
05:01:40.230 --> 05:01:40.240 align:start position:0%
back as far back as 2008 to current
 
05:01:42.110 --> 05:01:42.120 align:start position:0%
those are the numbers I could find
 
05:01:44.350 --> 05:01:44.360 align:start position:0%
looking at kneecap looking at smarter
 
05:01:45.910 --> 05:01:45.920 align:start position:0%
balance and looking at the New Hampshire
 
05:01:48.548 --> 05:01:48.558 align:start position:0%
Statewide assessment system assessment
 
05:01:51.350 --> 05:01:51.360 align:start position:0%
results New Hampshire Public School
 
05:01:56.590 --> 05:01:56.600 align:start position:0%
students as a group rarely break 50% of
 
05:02:00.150 --> 05:02:00.160 align:start position:0%
students at or above
 
05:02:04.070 --> 05:02:04.080 align:start position:0%
Proficiency in English language arts
 
05:02:06.788 --> 05:02:06.798 align:start position:0%
mathematics and
 
05:02:10.270 --> 05:02:10.280 align:start position:0%
science this is a fact Stark and
 
05:02:10.280 --> 05:02:11.390 align:start position:0%
science this is a fact Stark and
stunning

05:02:11.390 --> 05:02:11.400 align:start position:0%
stunning
 
05:02:14.230 --> 05:02:14.240 align:start position:0%
fact so while we may have some of the
 
05:02:17.190 --> 05:02:17.200 align:start position:0%
best public schools in the nation we are
 
05:02:20.510 --> 05:02:20.520 align:start position:0%
still on average missing the mark for
 
05:02:23.190 --> 05:02:23.200 align:start position:0%
half of our students for half of our
 
05:02:25.270 --> 05:02:25.280 align:start position:0%
students and for science the numbers are
 
05:02:28.270 --> 05:02:28.280 align:start position:0%
actually much worse than laa and
 
05:02:30.590 --> 05:02:30.600 align:start position:0%
Mathematics so when we talk about
 
05:02:32.350 --> 05:02:32.360 align:start position:0%
accountability you know where's the
 
05:02:34.590 --> 05:02:34.600 align:start position:0%
account ility for for those children
 
05:02:38.350 --> 05:02:38.360 align:start position:0%
that that aren't making that proficiency
 
05:02:40.868 --> 05:02:40.878 align:start position:0%
Mark it's interesting to note that once
 
05:02:43.270 --> 05:02:43.280 align:start position:0%
a student enters postsecondary education
 
05:02:46.310 --> 05:02:46.320 align:start position:0%
in America that's college and university
 
05:02:49.350 --> 05:02:49.360 align:start position:0%
we then transition to 100% school choice
 
05:02:51.590 --> 05:02:51.600 align:start position:0%
environment and look how good that
 
05:02:54.390 --> 05:02:54.400 align:start position:0%
system works the diversity in schools
 
05:02:57.190 --> 05:02:57.200 align:start position:0%
and programs is all but unparalleled and
 
05:03:00.548 --> 05:03:00.558 align:start position:0%
meets the needs of almost all
 
05:03:03.070 --> 05:03:03.080 align:start position:0%
interestingly we do not try to block
 
05:03:05.868 --> 05:03:05.878 align:start position:0%
taxpayer money in the form of pel Grants
 
05:03:08.190 --> 05:03:08.200 align:start position:0%
and student loans and other financial
 
05:03:10.510 --> 05:03:10.520 align:start position:0%
assistance from flowing to private
 
05:03:12.390 --> 05:03:12.400 align:start position:0%
colleges and universities or to
 
05:03:15.310 --> 05:03:15.320 align:start position:0%
religious colleges and universities this
 
05:03:17.628 --> 05:03:17.638 align:start position:0%
program is little different than those
 
05:03:21.788 --> 05:03:21.798 align:start position:0%
with where we allow taxpayer Monies to
 
05:03:24.470 --> 05:03:24.480 align:start position:0%
go the allegation there'll be an exodus
 
05:03:25.868 --> 05:03:25.878 align:start position:0%
of students from the local school
 
05:03:27.430 --> 05:03:27.440 align:start position:0%
districts to other
 
05:03:30.430 --> 05:03:30.440 align:start position:0%
opportunities is not a possibility at
 
05:03:33.150 --> 05:03:33.160 align:start position:0%
least not in the near future the reason
 
05:03:34.350 --> 05:03:34.360 align:start position:0%
for this is
 
05:03:36.910 --> 05:03:36.920 align:start position:0%
simple there are essentially no
 
05:03:40.470 --> 05:03:40.480 align:start position:0%
available slots in any non-public school
 
05:03:41.430 --> 05:03:41.440 align:start position:0%
in New
 
05:03:44.230 --> 05:03:44.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so today if I wanted to pull
 
05:03:46.190 --> 05:03:46.200 align:start position:0%
my kids from public school and send them
 
05:03:48.430 --> 05:03:48.440 align:start position:0%
to private school I would be very hard
 
05:03:50.750 --> 05:03:50.760 align:start position:0%
press to find a seat in any private
 
05:03:53.110 --> 05:03:53.120 align:start position:0%
school whether it be religious or not uh
 
05:03:55.788 --> 05:03:55.798 align:start position:0%
for the education of my children they've
 
05:03:58.750 --> 05:03:58.760 align:start position:0%
all been taken during the last year is
 
05:04:00.910 --> 05:04:00.920 align:start position:0%
parents seek out other options that best
 
05:04:02.948 --> 05:04:02.958 align:start position:0%
fit their needs with respect to the
 
05:04:04.628 --> 05:04:04.638 align:start position:0%
responses of
 
05:04:08.110 --> 05:04:08.120 align:start position:0%
covid-19 there is no available inventory
 
05:04:09.270 --> 05:04:09.280 align:start position:0%
except for
 
05:04:13.070 --> 05:04:13.080 align:start position:0%
homeschooling which is an option but an
 
05:04:16.270 --> 05:04:16.280 align:start position:0%
option that does not work for the vast
 
05:04:18.708 --> 05:04:18.718 align:start position:0%
majority of families God bless
 
05:04:21.548 --> 05:04:21.558 align:start position:0%
homeschoolers it's it that's a high bar
 
05:04:23.590 --> 05:04:23.600 align:start position:0%
and and they do a great job most
 
05:04:25.150 --> 05:04:25.160 align:start position:0%
families have have double working
 
05:04:27.070 --> 05:04:27.080 align:start position:0%
parents and they simply cannot choose
 
05:04:28.868 --> 05:04:28.878 align:start position:0%
that option for
 
05:04:31.430 --> 05:04:31.440 align:start position:0%
themselves it's not re it is not
 
05:04:33.788 --> 05:04:33.798 align:start position:0%
unreasonable to fact that the inventory
 
05:04:35.948 --> 05:04:35.958 align:start position:0%
of available slots in other education
 
05:04:38.190 --> 05:04:38.200 align:start position:0%
settings will increase to meet the
 
05:04:42.350 --> 05:04:42.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:45.868 --> 05:04:45.878 align:start position:0%
time Market forces are wonderful things
 
05:04:48.990 --> 05:04:49.000 align:start position:0%
to determine customer demands if a
 
05:04:51.270 --> 05:04:51.280 align:start position:0%
district school sees that it is losing
 
05:04:54.590 --> 05:04:54.600 align:start position:0%
students to other educational settings
 
05:04:56.510 --> 05:04:56.520 align:start position:0%
then that is an indication that they are
 
05:04:58.470 --> 05:04:58.480 align:start position:0%
not providing the product they are not
 
05:05:00.310 --> 05:05:00.320 align:start position:0%
providing the service that their
 
05:05:03.990 --> 05:05:04.000 align:start position:0%
customer base desires if this occurs
 
05:05:06.270 --> 05:05:06.280 align:start position:0%
then the district school has one of two
 
05:05:08.990 --> 05:05:09.000 align:start position:0%
options stay the course and lose more
 
05:05:10.830 --> 05:05:10.840 align:start position:0%
and more of their customers to the
 
05:05:14.310 --> 05:05:14.320 align:start position:0%
competition or retool and provide the
 
05:05:17.110 --> 05:05:17.120 align:start position:0%
product the service that their customer
 
05:05:20.510 --> 05:05:20.520 align:start position:0%
base desires this is a critical feedback
 
05:05:22.390 --> 05:05:22.400 align:start position:0%
loop that is currently missing from our
 
05:05:24.750 --> 05:05:24.760 align:start position:0%
public school system because we have
 
05:05:26.750 --> 05:05:26.760 align:start position:0%
continued to winnow our Public School
 
05:05:30.310 --> 05:05:30.320 align:start position:0%
System into such a tight
 
05:05:32.830 --> 05:05:32.840 align:start position:0%
Monopoly let us consider some of the
 
05:05:34.750 --> 05:05:34.760 align:start position:0%
likely critics of this bill there there
 
05:05:37.510 --> 05:05:37.520 align:start position:0%
are people against this bill um and I I
 
05:05:39.708 --> 05:05:39.718 align:start position:0%
don't don't deny them their right to be
 
05:05:41.948 --> 05:05:41.958 align:start position:0%
against it but we should consider uh
 
05:05:44.030 --> 05:05:44.040 align:start position:0%
backgrounds and motivations the teachers
 
05:05:45.830 --> 05:05:45.840 align:start position:0%
unions are almost certainly going to
 
05:05:47.430 --> 05:05:47.440 align:start position:0%
come out against that
 
05:05:50.070 --> 05:05:50.080 align:start position:0%
bill but that is because the bill has
 
05:05:52.030 --> 05:05:52.040 align:start position:0%
the potential to threaten their ability
 
05:05:55.990 --> 05:05:56.000 align:start position:0%
to attract customers to attract members
 
05:05:57.788 --> 05:05:57.798 align:start position:0%
the firefighters union represents
 
05:05:59.910 --> 05:05:59.920 align:start position:0%
firefighters police union represents
 
05:06:02.590 --> 05:06:02.600 align:start position:0%
police the teachers union represents
 
05:06:05.350 --> 05:06:05.360 align:start position:0%
teachers that are members of the union
 
05:06:09.430 --> 05:06:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:12.830 --> 05:06:12.840 align:start position:0%
less does this bill pose an existential
 
05:06:14.430 --> 05:06:14.440 align:start position:0%
threat to teachers
 
05:06:18.510 --> 05:06:18.520 align:start position:0%
unions not likely but this is not a risk
 
05:06:20.910 --> 05:06:20.920 align:start position:0%
those that earn their living for work
 
05:06:23.350 --> 05:06:23.360 align:start position:0%
from working for unions want to
 
05:06:26.030 --> 05:06:26.040 align:start position:0%
take the school boards Association will
 
05:06:28.350 --> 05:06:28.360 align:start position:0%
likely come out against this bill but
 
05:06:29.948 --> 05:06:29.958 align:start position:0%
that's because this bill has the
 
05:06:31.990 --> 05:06:32.000 align:start position:0%
potential to threaten their Monopoly
 
05:06:34.990 --> 05:06:35.000 align:start position:0%
control contr of local public education
 
05:06:37.470 --> 05:06:37.480 align:start position:0%
monies these groups are likely oppose
 
05:06:38.948 --> 05:06:38.958 align:start position:0%
this bill strictly from a
 
05:06:41.548 --> 05:06:41.558 align:start position:0%
self-preservation motive and that should
 
05:06:41.558 --> 05:06:42.788 align:start position:0%
self-preservation motive and that should
be

05:06:42.788 --> 05:06:42.798 align:start position:0%
be
 
05:06:45.390 --> 05:06:45.400 align:start position:0%
considered those that will Oppo oppose
 
05:06:47.548 --> 05:06:47.558 align:start position:0%
the bill because they do not want their
 
05:06:49.470 --> 05:06:49.480 align:start position:0%
tax money going to private or religious
 
05:06:51.270 --> 05:06:51.280 align:start position:0%
schools need to realize that this
 
05:06:54.510 --> 05:06:54.520 align:start position:0%
already occurs don't get me wrong I I
 
05:06:56.430 --> 05:06:56.440 align:start position:0%
appreciate their right to oppose this or
 
05:06:58.470 --> 05:06:58.480 align:start position:0%
any Bill I just want to make sure that
 
05:07:00.430 --> 05:07:00.440 align:start position:0%
we appreciate their potential bias and
 
05:07:04.070 --> 05:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
motivations for opposing the bill
 
05:07:08.590 --> 05:07:08.600 align:start position:0%
this bill is a pro- student Pro public
 
05:07:11.628 --> 05:07:11.638 align:start position:0%
education and pro best interest of the
 
05:07:14.788 --> 05:07:14.798 align:start position:0%
student bill this bill represents a
 
05:07:18.190 --> 05:07:18.200 align:start position:0%
Quantum step forward in the continuing
 
05:07:21.788 --> 05:07:21.798 align:start position:0%
journey of American public
 
05:07:24.548 --> 05:07:24.558 align:start position:0%
education the American public education
 
05:07:27.510 --> 05:07:27.520 align:start position:0%
system is a wonderful thing to be
 
05:07:31.628 --> 05:07:31.638 align:start position:0%
sure but American public education is
 
05:07:34.750 --> 05:07:34.760 align:start position:0%
and should continue to be a lot more
 
05:07:38.628 --> 05:07:38.638 align:start position:0%
than just a local District school let us
 
05:07:40.910 --> 05:07:40.920 align:start position:0%
do what is in the best interest of New
 
05:07:43.948 --> 05:07:43.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire children New Hampshire
 
05:07:46.830 --> 05:07:46.840 align:start position:0%
students and not confine ourselves to
 
05:07:48.590 --> 05:07:48.600 align:start position:0%
what is in the best interest of a
 
05:07:51.350 --> 05:07:51.360 align:start position:0%
particular institution or
 
05:07:53.750 --> 05:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
building but rather what is in the best
 
05:07:55.868 --> 05:07:55.878 align:start position:0%
interest of our students and our
 
05:07:58.910 --> 05:07:58.920 align:start position:0%
children public education is after all
 
05:08:01.230 --> 05:08:01.240 align:start position:0%
the Public Funding of the education of
 
05:08:02.750 --> 05:08:02.760 align:start position:0%
our children
 
05:08:05.548 --> 05:08:05.558 align:start position:0%
this bill respects that fact and will
 
05:08:08.868 --> 05:08:08.878 align:start position:0%
likely provide us a stronger and more
 
05:08:12.430 --> 05:08:12.440 align:start position:0%
robust public education system in the
 
05:08:14.788 --> 05:08:14.798 align:start position:0%

05:09:11.510 --> 05:09:11.520 align:start position:0%
section yeah thank you Mr chairman thank
 
05:09:13.670 --> 05:09:13.680 align:start position:0%
you uh representative Mila for for the
 
05:09:16.830 --> 05:09:16.840 align:start position:0%
question um I'm sorry can you just give
 
05:09:19.110 --> 05:09:19.120 align:start position:0%
me the line where that's found I just
 
05:09:28.788 --> 05:09:28.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:32.110 --> 05:09:32.120 align:start position:0%
29 yeah so schools and providers of educ
 
05:09:34.750 --> 05:09:34.760 align:start position:0%
Educational Services I I think a school
 
05:09:36.350 --> 05:09:36.360 align:start position:0%
we understand what a school is is that
 
05:09:38.548 --> 05:09:38.558 align:start position:0%
correct that's correct I don't I don't
 
05:09:41.230 --> 05:09:41.240 align:start position:0%
know what the other means yeah so the
 
05:09:43.230 --> 05:09:43.240 align:start position:0%
provider of Educational Service is a
 
05:09:45.708 --> 05:09:45.718 align:start position:0%
pretty broad term uh not formally
 
05:09:47.868 --> 05:09:47.878 align:start position:0%
defined in the bill and and certainly
 
05:09:50.430 --> 05:09:50.440 align:start position:0%
you know we could consider doing that uh
 
05:09:53.310 --> 05:09:53.320 align:start position:0%
but when we think about um tutors when
 
05:09:56.350 --> 05:09:56.360 align:start position:0%
we think about uh online learning
 
05:09:59.548 --> 05:09:59.558 align:start position:0%
opportunities um Hands-On uh type
 
05:10:03.628 --> 05:10:03.638 align:start position:0%
learning uh opportunities uh Cooperative
 
05:10:08.190 --> 05:10:08.200 align:start position:0%
uh education um situations uh it it goes
 
05:10:10.470 --> 05:10:10.480 align:start position:0%
to educational opportunities such as
 
05:10:12.990 --> 05:10:13.000 align:start position:0%
that that may take place outside of a
 
05:10:15.990 --> 05:10:16.000 align:start position:0%
traditional school thank you followup
 
05:10:18.470 --> 05:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
please yeah I would I would suggest that
 
05:10:21.230 --> 05:10:21.240 align:start position:0%
you do have a definition in that if you
 
05:10:22.470 --> 05:10:22.480 align:start position:0%
if you want to pursue that because it's
 
05:10:24.190 --> 05:10:24.200 align:start position:0%
not in the bill the second question I
 
05:10:27.190 --> 05:10:27.200 align:start position:0%
have is similar to what we we had in the
 
05:10:29.990 --> 05:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
conversation with uh
 
05:10:34.670 --> 05:10:34.680 align:start position:0%
hb20 my sense is just my sensus is that
 
05:10:37.350 --> 05:10:37.360 align:start position:0%
an individual could take one of these um
 
05:10:40.270 --> 05:10:40.280 align:start position:0%
vouchers from a local school district
 
05:10:42.788 --> 05:10:42.798 align:start position:0%
and there is no
 
05:10:44.990 --> 05:10:45.000 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination language in this
 
05:10:47.708 --> 05:10:47.718 align:start position:0%
bill so in essence they could take
 
05:10:50.948 --> 05:10:50.958 align:start position:0%
public monies and go to a school that
 
05:10:53.990 --> 05:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
does discriminate based upon you know
 
05:10:57.430 --> 05:10:57.440 align:start position:0%
religion gender Etc is that
 
05:10:59.548 --> 05:10:59.558 align:start position:0%
correct thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
05:11:01.390 --> 05:11:01.400 align:start position:0%
representative Miler for the question
 
05:11:03.510 --> 05:11:03.520 align:start position:0%
well first of of all um if we're really
 
05:11:05.510 --> 05:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
going to have an honest conversation
 
05:11:07.628 --> 05:11:07.638 align:start position:0%
about this we we need to be honest about
 
05:11:09.548 --> 05:11:09.558 align:start position:0%
what the program is and what the program
 
05:11:13.350 --> 05:11:13.360 align:start position:0%
is not and the program is not a voucher
 
05:11:15.910 --> 05:11:15.920 align:start position:0%
program right this does not this program
 
05:11:18.150 --> 05:11:18.160 align:start position:0%
does not meet the the definition of a
 
05:11:20.868 --> 05:11:20.878 align:start position:0%
voucher this is a much broader much more
 
05:11:23.470 --> 05:11:23.480 align:start position:0%
versatile much more Universal type
 
05:11:25.990 --> 05:11:26.000 align:start position:0%
program uh than what a traditional
 
05:11:29.470 --> 05:11:29.480 align:start position:0%
Voucher Program um is and provides so
 
05:11:31.590 --> 05:11:31.600 align:start position:0%
with all due respect I would I would ask
 
05:11:34.110 --> 05:11:34.120 align:start position:0%
that we we at least call it what it is
 
05:11:36.788 --> 05:11:36.798 align:start position:0%
or at least avoid not calling it that
 
05:11:39.030 --> 05:11:39.040 align:start position:0%
which It Isn't So it's not a voucher
 
05:11:42.030 --> 05:11:42.040 align:start position:0%
program um second of all you're you're
 
05:11:45.350 --> 05:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
correct the bill is not loaded up with
 
05:11:48.670 --> 05:11:48.680 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination uh language and so I
 
05:11:52.310 --> 05:11:52.320 align:start position:0%
would I would contend that it's it's
 
05:11:54.868 --> 05:11:54.878 align:start position:0%
probably not required although I would
 
05:11:57.430 --> 05:11:57.440 align:start position:0%
certainly be uh you know amendable to a
 
05:12:01.910 --> 05:12:01.920 align:start position:0%
friendly uh Amendment uh if a school is
 
05:12:05.230 --> 05:12:05.240 align:start position:0%
able to operate legally and uh you know
 
05:12:06.510 --> 05:12:06.520 align:start position:0%
is allowed to operate under the New
 
05:12:08.470 --> 05:12:08.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Education uh
 
05:12:10.948 --> 05:12:10.958 align:start position:0%
rules for accredited schools then I
 
05:12:14.350 --> 05:12:14.360 align:start position:0%
don't see um why we would want to uh
 
05:12:16.708 --> 05:12:16.718 align:start position:0%
fill this bill with a bunch of uh legal
 
05:12:19.070 --> 05:12:19.080 align:start position:0%
regulations that already exist and
 
05:12:22.708 --> 05:12:22.718 align:start position:0%
govern those uh those schools and
 
05:12:25.350 --> 05:12:25.360 align:start position:0%
institutions U just a just a a comment
 
05:12:27.590 --> 05:12:27.600 align:start position:0%
please uh you can call it what you want
 
05:12:29.590 --> 05:12:29.600 align:start position:0%
I'll call it what I think it is and I
 
05:12:32.190 --> 05:12:32.200 align:start position:0%
continue to do that uh the Dilemma that
 
05:12:37.030 --> 05:12:37.040 align:start position:0%
we have is that unlike another uh other
 
05:12:39.788 --> 05:12:39.798 align:start position:0%
opportunities for kids to have uh these
 
05:12:43.110 --> 05:12:43.120 align:start position:0%
tax credit uh programs this is public
 
05:12:46.590 --> 05:12:46.600 align:start position:0%
money not private money that is going to
 
05:12:50.708 --> 05:12:50.718 align:start position:0%
potentially a school that has
 
05:12:53.030 --> 05:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
discriminator practices particularly I'm
 
05:12:55.310 --> 05:12:55.320 align:start position:0%
thinking of those schools that would uh
 
05:12:57.948 --> 05:12:57.958 align:start position:0%
deal with u the gender issue and that's
 
05:13:00.670 --> 05:13:00.680 align:start position:0%
that's a real concern of mine I don't
 
05:13:02.510 --> 05:13:02.520 align:start position:0%
think taxpayers want that to do that but
 
05:13:05.510 --> 05:13:05.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your time Mr Mr
 
05:13:07.868 --> 05:13:07.878 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman can I respond to that please
 
05:13:08.830 --> 05:13:08.840 align:start position:0%
yes go
 
05:13:11.230 --> 05:13:11.240 align:start position:0%
ahead yes thank you Mr chairman and
 
05:13:12.948 --> 05:13:12.958 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Myer I I
 
05:13:17.030 --> 05:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
certainly appreciate um your position so
 
05:13:19.750 --> 05:13:19.760 align:start position:0%
the what I guess what I would point out
 
05:13:19.760 --> 05:13:20.628 align:start position:0%
the what I guess what I would point out
is

05:13:20.628 --> 05:13:20.638 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:13:24.270 --> 05:13:24.280 align:start position:0%
that the the money is public money for
 
05:13:26.350 --> 05:13:26.360 align:start position:0%
the education of a child and what this
 
05:13:28.948 --> 05:13:28.958 align:start position:0%
bill allows is for that money to
 
05:13:31.310 --> 05:13:31.320 align:start position:0%
potentially follow a student so that a
 
05:13:33.948 --> 05:13:33.958 align:start position:0%
student and their family could Define
 
05:13:35.590 --> 05:13:35.600 align:start position:0%
for themselves what's in the best
 
05:13:37.708 --> 05:13:37.718 align:start position:0%
interest of their student there is no
 
05:13:40.150 --> 05:13:40.160 align:start position:0%
guarantee with this program that any
 
05:13:43.190 --> 05:13:43.200 align:start position:0%
child that wants to go to any school uh
 
05:13:45.750 --> 05:13:45.760 align:start position:0%
will be accepted into that school for
 
05:13:48.270 --> 05:13:48.280 align:start position:0%
whatever various reasons that that may
 
05:13:50.470 --> 05:13:50.480 align:start position:0%
be perhaps the the child doesn't meet
 
05:13:52.590 --> 05:13:52.600 align:start position:0%
the minimum academic threshold that the
 
05:13:56.590 --> 05:13:56.600 align:start position:0%
school um is Desiring there maybe maybe
 
05:13:59.430 --> 05:13:59.440 align:start position:0%
the the school um you know for whatever
 
05:14:04.868 --> 05:14:04.878 align:start position:0%
reason so the this is a a free choice of
 
05:14:07.910 --> 05:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
families of children to be able to take
 
05:14:11.708 --> 05:14:11.718 align:start position:0%
money and seek out alternative education
 
05:14:13.708 --> 05:14:13.718 align:start position:0%
environments that are in the best
 
05:14:16.590 --> 05:14:16.600 align:start position:0%
interest of their child of their student
 
05:14:19.070 --> 05:14:19.080 align:start position:0%
to get that child the best education
 
05:14:22.430 --> 05:14:22.440 align:start position:0%
they can that may not be available in
 
05:14:25.910 --> 05:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
the Local District school and right now
 
05:14:28.310 --> 05:14:28.320 align:start position:0%
right now the only option other than the
 
05:14:30.310 --> 05:14:30.320 align:start position:0%
Local District school for the vast
 
05:14:33.150 --> 05:14:33.160 align:start position:0%
majority of families based purely on
 
05:14:35.548 --> 05:14:35.558 align:start position:0%
financial reality is that they don't
 
05:14:38.670 --> 05:14:38.680 align:start position:0%
have the resources to to select any
 
05:14:42.708 --> 05:14:42.718 align:start position:0%
other option and this bill would make it
 
05:14:46.270 --> 05:14:46.280 align:start position:0%
possible for communities to decide for
 
05:14:48.750 --> 05:14:48.760 align:start position:0%
themselves if they want their local
 
05:14:52.070 --> 05:14:52.080 align:start position:0%
money to be able to follow the child to
 
05:14:55.270 --> 05:14:55.280 align:start position:0%
make available those other opportunities
 
05:14:57.110 --> 05:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
uh for families that otherwise simply
 
05:15:00.070 --> 05:15:00.080 align:start position:0%
could not afford it um and again I the
 
05:15:01.590 --> 05:15:01.600 align:start position:0%
the number of students that would have
 
05:15:03.548 --> 05:15:03.558 align:start position:0%
Avail themselves of this program I
 
05:15:06.390 --> 05:15:06.400 align:start position:0%
believe um would be small for the vast
 
05:15:08.910 --> 05:15:08.920 align:start position:0%
majority of schools and if it's a very
 
05:15:11.070 --> 05:15:11.080 align:start position:0%
very large number for a local uh
 
05:15:12.948 --> 05:15:12.958 align:start position:0%
District school then the Local District
 
05:15:15.868 --> 05:15:15.878 align:start position:0%
School uh probably has some some inward
 
05:15:17.788 --> 05:15:17.798 align:start position:0%
looking to to do about the product
 
05:15:20.868 --> 05:15:20.878 align:start position:0%
they're providing thank you Mr
 
05:15:23.030 --> 05:15:23.040 align:start position:0%

paraprofessionals these these would be
 
05:17:11.190 --> 05:17:11.200 align:start position:0%
people um that would hold um particular
 
05:17:13.310 --> 05:17:13.320 align:start position:0%
professional certifications from
 
05:17:16.230 --> 05:17:16.240 align:start position:0%
organizations to provide um certain
 
05:17:19.470 --> 05:17:19.480 align:start position:0%
types of uh educational instruction or
 
05:17:22.230 --> 05:17:22.240 align:start position:0%
therapies right so typically um
 
05:17:25.150 --> 05:17:25.160 align:start position:0%
certification programs are to
 
05:17:27.990 --> 05:17:28.000 align:start position:0%
demonstrate uh Proficiency in a
 
05:17:31.430 --> 05:17:31.440 align:start position:0%
specialized area or to uh highlight a
 
05:17:33.628 --> 05:17:33.638 align:start position:0%
particular expertise in a professional
 
05:17:37.390 --> 05:17:37.400 align:start position:0%
area and so um that would simply allow
 
05:17:40.948 --> 05:17:40.958 align:start position:0%
for for those people with particular um
 
05:17:43.510 --> 05:17:43.520 align:start position:0%
specialized um knowledge based
 
05:17:46.310 --> 05:17:46.320 align:start position:0%
instructional methods Etc uh to be able
 
05:17:49.910 --> 05:17:49.920 align:start position:0%
to be hired for this I think when we so
 
05:17:51.990 --> 05:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
I I don't want to put too fine a point
 
05:17:54.670 --> 05:17:54.680 align:start position:0%
on it because the bill is designed to be
 
05:17:56.910 --> 05:17:56.920 align:start position:0%
written very very broadly to allow a
 
05:17:59.510 --> 05:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
very broad spectrum of possibilities
 
05:18:01.788 --> 05:18:01.798 align:start position:0%
okay A lot of times hold on a lot of
 
05:18:03.670 --> 05:18:03.680 align:start position:0%
times your certified par professionals
 
05:18:06.030 --> 05:18:06.040 align:start position:0%
and educational AIDS are people that are
 
05:18:08.788 --> 05:18:08.798 align:start position:0%
associated with particular um parts of
 
05:18:12.430 --> 05:18:12.440 align:start position:0%
special ed uh education and um dealing
 
05:18:15.350 --> 05:18:15.360 align:start position:0%
with special education uh
 
05:18:17.510 --> 05:18:17.520 align:start position:0%
needs the final question by m Mr the
 
05:18:19.070 --> 05:18:19.080 align:start position:0%
chairman once again nothing nothing
 
05:18:21.470 --> 05:18:21.480 align:start position:0%
point just trying to clarify Uh Kevin
 
05:18:22.708 --> 05:18:22.718 align:start position:0%
you go to line down on the same page
 
05:18:24.548 --> 05:18:24.558 align:start position:0%
line 34
 
05:18:27.470 --> 05:18:27.480 align:start position:0%
please yes sir okay I'm looking at 33
 
05:18:29.990 --> 05:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
and 34 and and I want to make sure I'm
 
05:18:33.390 --> 05:18:33.400 align:start position:0%
understanding this as I read 33 and 34
 
05:18:36.070 --> 05:18:36.080 align:start position:0%
that says to me if I have a student and
 
05:18:37.390 --> 05:18:37.400 align:start position:0%
I maybe all wrong in this that's point
 
05:18:40.190 --> 05:18:40.200 align:start position:0%
of clarity if I have a student or young
 
05:18:42.430 --> 05:18:42.440 align:start position:0%
my my own youngster who's going to a
 
05:18:45.628 --> 05:18:45.638 align:start position:0%
school under your plan they can come
 
05:18:47.910 --> 05:18:47.920 align:start position:0%
back and play sports or be in the
 
05:18:50.310 --> 05:18:50.320 align:start position:0%
science club yada yada yada at the high
 
05:18:52.670 --> 05:18:52.680 align:start position:0%
school they had attended previously is
 
05:18:52.680 --> 05:18:54.628 align:start position:0%
school they had attended previously is
that

05:18:54.628 --> 05:18:54.638 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:18:56.670 --> 05:18:56.680 align:start position:0%
correct uh thank you Mr chairman thank
 
05:18:57.910 --> 05:18:57.920 align:start position:0%
you Mr Woodcock for the qu
 
05:18:59.390 --> 05:18:59.400 align:start position:0%
representative Woodcock for the question
 
05:19:02.070 --> 05:19:02.080 align:start position:0%
that's that's an excellent question so
 
05:19:04.990 --> 05:19:05.000 align:start position:0%
um the the short answer is yes and if
 
05:19:06.670 --> 05:19:06.680 align:start position:0%
you'll um if you'll bear with me I'd
 
05:19:08.270 --> 05:19:08.280 align:start position:0%
like to flush it out a little bit so
 
05:19:12.628 --> 05:19:12.638 align:start position:0%
that that currently exists um in in RSA
 
05:19:15.670 --> 05:19:15.680 align:start position:0%
right so uh if if one chooses to
 
05:19:19.788 --> 05:19:19.798 align:start position:0%
homeschool their child today um you have
 
05:19:22.708 --> 05:19:22.718 align:start position:0%
availability for that child to play in
 
05:19:25.750 --> 05:19:25.760 align:start position:0%
the uh local school sports teams
 
05:19:28.470 --> 05:19:28.480 align:start position:0%
extracurricular uh Etc in fact if you
 
05:19:32.670 --> 05:19:32.680 align:start position:0%
send a child to a um Charter School an
 
05:19:35.110 --> 05:19:35.120 align:start position:0%
out of District Charter School you still
 
05:19:39.590 --> 05:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
retain that access to um to sports teams
 
05:19:43.548 --> 05:19:43.558 align:start position:0%
and and other things so it it simply
 
05:19:45.670 --> 05:19:45.680 align:start position:0%
this is this is just to be very clear in
 
05:19:47.910 --> 05:19:47.920 align:start position:0%
the law that if you Avail yourself of
 
05:19:50.628 --> 05:19:50.638 align:start position:0%
this program that doesn't uh cut you out
 
05:19:52.548 --> 05:19:52.558 align:start position:0%
of those benefits that we're already
 
05:19:54.708 --> 05:19:54.718 align:start position:0%
providing others that have chosen to
 
05:19:57.110 --> 05:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
leave the Local District school just to
 
05:20:00.150 --> 05:20:00.160 align:start position:0%
followup Mr shair and last one
 
05:20:02.910 --> 05:20:02.920 align:start position:0%
representative I understand that um
 
05:20:05.628 --> 05:20:05.638 align:start position:0%
thank you that that's partially
 
05:20:08.270 --> 05:20:08.280 align:start position:0%
informative the the second part is my
 
05:20:11.590 --> 05:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
question I thought under your plan if I
 
05:20:13.830 --> 05:20:13.840 align:start position:0%
leave the school district I choose to
 
05:20:15.910 --> 05:20:15.920 align:start position:0%
leave the school district I am out of
 
05:20:18.310 --> 05:20:18.320 align:start position:0%
the school district unlike a homeschool
 
05:20:21.190 --> 05:20:21.200 align:start position:0%
who still enrolled in school
 
05:20:23.548 --> 05:20:23.558 align:start position:0%
district so when I say that you're out
 
05:20:25.830 --> 05:20:25.840 align:start position:0%
of the school district you once you once
 
05:20:28.390 --> 05:20:28.400 align:start position:0%
you enter this plan just like a
 
05:20:30.788 --> 05:20:30.798 align:start position:0%
homeschooler you would no longer be
 
05:20:33.030 --> 05:20:33.040 align:start position:0%
count Ed towards the average daily
 
05:20:35.590 --> 05:20:35.600 align:start position:0%
attendance for the purposes of
 
05:20:39.270 --> 05:20:39.280 align:start position:0%
calculating um a state adequacy Grant um
 
05:20:40.670 --> 05:20:40.680 align:start position:0%
and obviously any potential
 
05:20:42.868 --> 05:20:42.878 align:start position:0%
differentiated Aid that might follow the
 
05:20:44.190 --> 05:20:44.200 align:start position:0%
follow the
 
05:20:47.750 --> 05:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
child but I could take that's okay I
 
05:20:49.990 --> 05:20:50.000 align:start position:0%
could take advantage
 
05:20:52.868 --> 05:20:52.878 align:start position:0%
ofes right yes I could okay thank you
 
05:20:54.670 --> 05:20:54.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you very
 
05:20:56.510 --> 05:20:56.520 align:start position:0%
much uh further question thank you
 
05:20:56.520 --> 05:21:00.030 align:start position:0%
much uh further question thank you
representative

05:21:00.030 --> 05:21:00.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:00.040 --> 05:21:01.948 align:start position:0%
 
and

05:21:01.948 --> 05:21:01.958 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:21:03.708 --> 05:21:03.718 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
05:21:05.708 --> 05:21:05.718 align:start position:0%
representative verville for taking my
 
05:21:08.670 --> 05:21:08.680 align:start position:0%
question so I I I just for the sake of
 
05:21:10.990 --> 05:21:11.000 align:start position:0%
Simplicity sake let me just make sure
 
05:21:13.910 --> 05:21:13.920 align:start position:0%
that I understand um what the process
 
05:21:20.788 --> 05:21:20.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:25.670 --> 05:21:25.680 align:start position:0%
uh clim to 85% of the money that is
 
05:21:28.830 --> 05:21:28.840 align:start position:0%
raised locally that would ordinarily be
 
05:21:31.150 --> 05:21:31.160 align:start position:0%
used within their school district to
 
05:21:33.708 --> 05:21:33.718 align:start position:0%
educate them and 90% of the state
 
05:21:37.270 --> 05:21:37.280 align:start position:0%
adequacy money is that my my numbers are
 
05:21:42.230 --> 05:21:42.240 align:start position:0%
correct 85% of their local 85% of what
 
05:21:44.590 --> 05:21:44.600 align:start position:0%
it would cost the Local District and 90%
 
05:21:46.470 --> 05:21:46.480 align:start position:0%
of the adequacy
 
05:21:48.708 --> 05:21:48.718 align:start position:0%
money yes thank you Mr chairman thank
 
05:21:50.270 --> 05:21:50.280 align:start position:0%
you representative Mullen for for the
 
05:21:52.990 --> 05:21:53.000 align:start position:0%
question um yes that that is correct so
 
05:21:56.030 --> 05:21:56.040 align:start position:0%
it's 85% of the local money so 15% of
 
05:21:57.948 --> 05:21:57.958 align:start position:0%
the local money stays in the Local
 
05:22:01.590 --> 05:22:01.600 align:start position:0%
District school um the 90%
 
05:22:06.990 --> 05:22:07.000 align:start position:0%
um was was set because there's um if you
 
05:22:08.628 --> 05:22:08.638 align:start position:0%
know if you've been at this for a while
 
05:22:10.868 --> 05:22:10.878 align:start position:0%
you recognize a lot of this language
 
05:22:12.868 --> 05:22:12.878 align:start position:0%
from what was lovingly known as Senate
 
05:22:16.070 --> 05:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
Bill 193 from three years ago and it was
 
05:22:17.230 --> 05:22:17.240 align:start position:0%
set at
 
05:22:20.590 --> 05:22:20.600 align:start position:0%
90% um I had I had a feeling although
 
05:22:23.350 --> 05:22:23.360 align:start position:0%
not direct knowledge that uh a very
 
05:22:28.390 --> 05:22:28.400 align:start position:0%
similar Bill to um the former SB 1993
 
05:22:31.990 --> 05:22:32.000 align:start position:0%
would be coming forward and so I I I
 
05:22:34.270 --> 05:22:34.280 align:start position:0%
assumed that they would remain at that
 
05:22:38.270 --> 05:22:38.280 align:start position:0%
90% for the state monies so um yes there
 
05:22:41.070 --> 05:22:41.080 align:start position:0%
is a little bit more money staying back
 
05:22:44.470 --> 05:22:44.480 align:start position:0%
with the Local District um to you know
 
05:22:47.948 --> 05:22:47.958 align:start position:0%
to cover whatever various expenses and I
 
05:22:50.030 --> 05:22:50.040 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure it was consistent if
 
05:22:52.670 --> 05:22:52.680 align:start position:0%
another bill um should should pass and
 
05:22:54.628 --> 05:22:54.638 align:start position:0%
become law so this year you know that
 
05:22:57.590 --> 05:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
bill is obviously is House Bill 20 okay
 
05:23:01.150 --> 05:23:01.160 align:start position:0%
so thank you for that so uh I'm going to
 
05:23:03.310 --> 05:23:03.320 align:start position:0%
make up a figure because I know that the
 
05:23:05.270 --> 05:23:05.280 align:start position:0%
figure is going to change from District
 
05:23:09.110 --> 05:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
to District in terms of the 85% so let's
 
05:23:11.788 --> 05:23:11.798 align:start position:0%
say that the total monies that a student
 
05:23:15.350 --> 05:23:15.360 align:start position:0%
had at their disposal was
 
05:23:18.470 --> 05:23:18.480 align:start position:0%
$155,000 where where are they going with
 
05:23:22.150 --> 05:23:22.160 align:start position:0%
that money where if they're no longer in
 
05:23:25.190 --> 05:23:25.200 align:start position:0%
their public school system are they all
 
05:23:27.548 --> 05:23:27.558 align:start position:0%
taking that 15,000 and going to a
 
05:23:30.390 --> 05:23:30.400 align:start position:0%
private school and paying tuition are
 
05:23:33.390 --> 05:23:33.400 align:start position:0%
they trying to get into another Public
 
05:23:36.310 --> 05:23:36.320 align:start position:0%
School are they putting it towards
 
05:23:40.350 --> 05:23:40.360 align:start position:0%
homeschool costs or all of
 
05:23:42.230 --> 05:23:42.240 align:start position:0%
those thank you for the question
 
05:23:44.510 --> 05:23:44.520 align:start position:0%
representative that that is a fantastic
 
05:23:48.590 --> 05:23:48.600 align:start position:0%
question so the the answer is you you
 
05:23:50.628 --> 05:23:50.638 align:start position:0%
arrived at the answer at the very end
 
05:23:53.310 --> 05:23:53.320 align:start position:0%
right so this this money goes into an
 
05:23:56.230 --> 05:23:56.240 align:start position:0%
educational savings account for which
 
05:24:00.910 --> 05:24:00.920 align:start position:0%
the family can withdraw um to pay for
 
05:24:02.868 --> 05:24:02.878 align:start position:0%
Educational Services to provide an
 
05:24:06.230 --> 05:24:06.240 align:start position:0%
education for their child and what that
 
05:24:08.670 --> 05:24:08.680 align:start position:0%
would look like for any individual or
 
05:24:12.990 --> 05:24:13.000 align:start position:0%
any any family uh will likely be uh
 
05:24:15.708 --> 05:24:15.718 align:start position:0%
different so yes a family a family could
 
05:24:18.750 --> 05:24:18.760 align:start position:0%
could take this this $15,000 and apply
 
05:24:21.910 --> 05:24:21.920 align:start position:0%
it directly uh towards tuition at
 
05:24:24.310 --> 05:24:24.320 align:start position:0%
another school and when we say another
 
05:24:26.830 --> 05:24:26.840 align:start position:0%
school that's basically any school right
 
05:24:29.750 --> 05:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
so um perhaps well deerfield's a bad
 
05:24:32.110 --> 05:24:32.120 align:start position:0%
example we we are a little bit unusual
 
05:24:34.150 --> 05:24:34.160 align:start position:0%
and our student enrollment is continues
 
05:24:36.628 --> 05:24:36.638 align:start position:0%
to increase um so we would not accept
 
05:24:38.788 --> 05:24:38.798 align:start position:0%
students in under tuition most likely
 
05:24:40.910 --> 05:24:40.920 align:start position:0%
but if we imagine another town in my
 
05:24:43.190 --> 05:24:43.200 align:start position:0%
district um Candia New Hampshire Candia
 
05:24:46.310 --> 05:24:46.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has a wonderful um one
 
05:24:47.948 --> 05:24:47.958 align:start position:0%
through eight or k through eight uh
 
05:24:50.350 --> 05:24:50.360 align:start position:0%
school and their population is way down
 
05:24:52.190 --> 05:24:52.200 align:start position:0%
they would love to accept students under
 
05:24:54.190 --> 05:24:54.200 align:start position:0%
a tuition agreement I think to keep
 
05:24:56.910 --> 05:24:56.920 align:start position:0%
their their facility closer to uh what
 
05:24:59.708 --> 05:24:59.718 align:start position:0%
its capacity was designed to be so it
 
05:25:01.510 --> 05:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
could be another uh Public School it
 
05:25:03.470 --> 05:25:03.480 align:start position:0%
could be a private school it could be
 
05:25:06.190 --> 05:25:06.200 align:start position:0%
home school it could be uh online
 
05:25:09.390 --> 05:25:09.400 align:start position:0%
education it it could be really any uh
 
05:25:12.590 --> 05:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
combination of those of those things so
 
05:25:14.788 --> 05:25:14.798 align:start position:0%
it it it really opens up some very
 
05:25:17.150 --> 05:25:17.160 align:start position:0%
open-ended educational possibilities for
 
05:25:19.510 --> 05:25:19.520 align:start position:0%
families uh representative one last
 
05:25:21.350 --> 05:25:21.360 align:start position:0%
question on this this train of thought
 
05:25:24.510 --> 05:25:24.520 align:start position:0%
anyhow um so are there Provisions in
 
05:25:27.150 --> 05:25:27.160 align:start position:0%
your bill for uh somehow or another
 
05:25:30.070 --> 05:25:30.080 align:start position:0%
monitoring how the money is being used I
 
05:25:34.070 --> 05:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
mean how who's who's keeping track of
 
05:25:38.430 --> 05:25:38.440 align:start position:0%
how and who and is that up to the family
 
05:25:40.750 --> 05:25:40.760 align:start position:0%
or is it up to a scholarship
 
05:25:44.230 --> 05:25:44.240 align:start position:0%
organization or the doe
 
05:25:46.230 --> 05:25:46.240 align:start position:0%
or thank thank you for the question
 
05:25:48.470 --> 05:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
representative it's a great question um
 
05:25:50.830 --> 05:25:50.840 align:start position:0%
it I have to admit my eyes are not good
 
05:25:53.590 --> 05:25:53.600 align:start position:0%
and the font is small on the bill um so
 
05:25:55.470 --> 05:25:55.480 align:start position:0%
I will I will talk globally instead of
 
05:25:57.830 --> 05:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
trying to find specific language and and
 
05:26:01.030 --> 05:26:01.040 align:start position:0%
that'll save us some time um the the
 
05:26:04.070 --> 05:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
bill would transfer the money the school
 
05:26:06.390 --> 05:26:06.400 align:start position:0%
district would transfer the money to a
 
05:26:09.230 --> 05:26:09.240 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization the state would
 
05:26:11.390 --> 05:26:11.400 align:start position:0%
transfer their portion of the money to
 
05:26:15.110 --> 05:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
the scholarship organization and then um
 
05:26:16.708 --> 05:26:16.718 align:start position:0%
it's that account that would be drawn
 
05:26:18.470 --> 05:26:18.480 align:start position:0%
off there are and when when you have
 
05:26:20.310 --> 05:26:20.320 align:start position:0%
time to read the bill more thoroughly
 
05:26:22.948 --> 05:26:22.958 align:start position:0%
you will find that there are Provisions
 
05:26:25.750 --> 05:26:25.760 align:start position:0%
um for auditing of the spending of the
 
05:26:28.510 --> 05:26:28.520 align:start position:0%
money uh and auditing of the program to
 
05:26:31.910 --> 05:26:31.920 align:start position:0%
ensure that this money is being used for
 
05:26:33.230 --> 05:26:33.240 align:start position:0%
uh approved
 
05:26:36.190 --> 05:26:36.200 align:start position:0%
educational uh needs and requirements
 
05:26:38.830 --> 05:26:38.840 align:start position:0%
and that if you are found to be out of
 
05:26:41.190 --> 05:26:41.200 align:start position:0%
bounds on any of that you are you are
 
05:26:43.548 --> 05:26:43.558 align:start position:0%
out you're ticked out of the um out of
 
05:26:46.270 --> 05:26:46.280 align:start position:0%
the program and uh remaining monies
 
05:26:48.830 --> 05:26:48.840 align:start position:0%
would revert back to the local school
 
05:26:52.230 --> 05:26:52.240 align:start position:0%
district and uh presumably uh Court
 
05:26:54.910 --> 05:26:54.920 align:start position:0%
action would follow to uh to recoup any
 
05:26:57.548 --> 05:26:57.558 align:start position:0%
any monies that were um
 
05:26:59.430 --> 05:26:59.440 align:start position:0%
mismanaged but it relies on a
 
05:27:01.750 --> 05:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
scholarship program one one last
 
05:27:04.868 --> 05:27:04.878 align:start position:0%
question Mr chair I promise so in in
 
05:27:08.548 --> 05:27:08.558 align:start position:0%
looking at this auditing who who sets up
 
05:27:10.628 --> 05:27:10.638 align:start position:0%
the requirements is it
 
05:27:13.470 --> 05:27:13.480 align:start position:0%
the representative Mullen we've had a
 
05:27:16.548 --> 05:27:16.558 align:start position:0%
number of followup questions of we have
 
05:27:19.470 --> 05:27:19.480 align:start position:0%
so many people that want to speak I I I
 
05:27:22.150 --> 05:27:22.160 align:start position:0%
will defer to my colleagues Mr chair
 
05:27:24.708 --> 05:27:24.718 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative Le
 
05:27:25.990 --> 05:27:26.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
05:27:27.910 --> 05:27:27.920 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my questions
 
05:27:29.990 --> 05:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
uh before I proceed I will announce that
 
05:27:32.590 --> 05:27:32.600 align:start position:0%
it is my Declaration of intent I am the
 
05:27:34.190 --> 05:27:34.200 align:start position:0%
President of the American Federation of
 
05:27:36.110 --> 05:27:36.120 align:start position:0%
teachers New Hampshire and it is my
 
05:27:38.990 --> 05:27:39.000 align:start position:0%
intent to participate in this in
 
05:27:41.750 --> 05:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
accordance with the informal resolution
 
05:27:46.788 --> 05:27:46.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:51.190 --> 05:27:51.200 align:start position:0%
2019-02 um contrary to the uh um sort of
 
05:27:53.510 --> 05:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
motivations that were imputed to me by
 
05:27:55.628 --> 05:27:55.638 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor I just want to make
 
05:27:57.788 --> 05:27:57.798 align:start position:0%
clear that my primary motivation and
 
05:27:59.030 --> 05:27:59.040 align:start position:0%
position on this bill shall be
 
05:28:00.868 --> 05:28:00.878 align:start position:0%
determined what I believe by what I
 
05:28:02.310 --> 05:28:02.320 align:start position:0%
believe is in the best interest of
 
05:28:04.350 --> 05:28:04.360 align:start position:0%
public education in New Hampshire just
 
05:28:06.750 --> 05:28:06.760 align:start position:0%
as I believe that the prime sponsor is
 
05:28:09.110 --> 05:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
motivated in the same fashion and in the
 
05:28:12.948 --> 05:28:12.958 align:start position:0%
same way now to my questions
 
05:28:16.750 --> 05:28:16.760 align:start position:0%
um the uh scholarship organization uh on
 
05:28:20.390 --> 05:28:20.400 align:start position:0%
line on page four uh lines 156 can
 
05:28:23.708 --> 05:28:23.718 align:start position:0%
accept gifts grants of any kind from any
 
05:28:25.750 --> 05:28:25.760 align:start position:0%
public or private entity to carry out
 
05:28:28.830 --> 05:28:28.840 align:start position:0%
the purposes of the chapter um my
 
05:28:30.750 --> 05:28:30.760 align:start position:0%
question here is are there any
 
05:28:33.628 --> 05:28:33.638 align:start position:0%
guidelines as to how they would spend or
 
05:28:35.350 --> 05:28:35.360 align:start position:0%
distribute such
 
05:28:38.390 --> 05:28:38.400 align:start position:0%
monies uh to those who are participating
 
05:28:39.750 --> 05:28:39.760 align:start position:0%
in the program because this would be
 
05:28:42.788 --> 05:28:42.798 align:start position:0%
above and beyond uh the uh money's
 
05:28:44.230 --> 05:28:44.240 align:start position:0%
deposited in an
 
05:28:47.470 --> 05:28:47.480 align:start position:0%
EFA um and also as to whether or not
 
05:28:48.830 --> 05:28:48.840 align:start position:0%
there is any
 
05:28:52.470 --> 05:28:52.480 align:start position:0%
audit particularly an independent audit
 
05:28:55.470 --> 05:28:55.480 align:start position:0%
of the scholarship organization itself
 
05:28:57.830 --> 05:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
not the efas but the scholarship
 
05:29:01.070 --> 05:29:01.080 align:start position:0%
organization itself as mandated is is is
 
05:29:03.788 --> 05:29:03.798 align:start position:0%
any such audit mandated in this
 
05:29:07.030 --> 05:29:07.040 align:start position:0%
bill uh thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
05:29:09.510 --> 05:29:09.520 align:start position:0%
uh representative Le first of all um
 
05:29:12.470 --> 05:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
Please be aware that in my uh opening
 
05:29:15.830 --> 05:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
remarks I was speaking to no particular
 
05:29:18.510 --> 05:29:18.520 align:start position:0%
individual um or about a particular
 
05:29:22.070 --> 05:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
individual but simply making it clear
 
05:29:24.270 --> 05:29:24.280 align:start position:0%
that certain people come at things from
 
05:29:26.070 --> 05:29:26.080 align:start position:0%
certain perspectives and I was not
 
05:29:28.270 --> 05:29:28.280 align:start position:0%
speaking of you specifically or any
 
05:29:30.750 --> 05:29:30.760 align:start position:0%
other person specifically uh for the
 
05:29:33.470 --> 05:29:33.480 align:start position:0%
record you know I was once a member of I
 
05:29:35.470 --> 05:29:35.480 align:start position:0%
was once a member of a teachers union
 
05:29:37.548 --> 05:29:37.558 align:start position:0%
right I was I was a dues paying member
 
05:29:39.628 --> 05:29:39.638 align:start position:0%
for for many years while while I was a
 
05:29:41.470 --> 05:29:41.480 align:start position:0%
teacher and and I still have a dues
 
05:29:43.310 --> 05:29:43.320 align:start position:0%
paying member in the in the household
 
05:29:46.310 --> 05:29:46.320 align:start position:0%
today so U don't please don't take it
 
05:29:50.628 --> 05:29:50.638 align:start position:0%
incorrectly so um I I I will
 
05:29:54.270 --> 05:29:54.280 align:start position:0%
confess um that there there is there is
 
05:29:57.230 --> 05:29:57.240 align:start position:0%
not definition in this in this
 
05:30:01.190 --> 05:30:01.200 align:start position:0%
particular bill as to um how that money
 
05:30:04.110 --> 05:30:04.120 align:start position:0%
would be dispersed or used by the
 
05:30:06.788 --> 05:30:06.798 align:start position:0%
organization it is but this line is
 
05:30:09.548 --> 05:30:09.558 align:start position:0%
simply to make it clear that the the
 
05:30:12.590 --> 05:30:12.600 align:start position:0%
only source of monies does not have to
 
05:30:16.270 --> 05:30:16.280 align:start position:0%
be uh the state portion of the monies
 
05:30:18.670 --> 05:30:18.680 align:start position:0%
nor the local education so that if
 
05:30:21.590 --> 05:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
somebody uh wanted to make a charitable
 
05:30:24.628 --> 05:30:24.638 align:start position:0%
contribution uh to the organization for
 
05:30:27.030 --> 05:30:27.040 align:start position:0%
for the for their purposes um that would
 
05:30:31.670 --> 05:30:31.680 align:start position:0%
be um completely acceptable uh I am not
 
05:30:36.030 --> 05:30:36.040 align:start position:0%
a um Financial expert to say the least
 
05:30:37.830 --> 05:30:37.840 align:start position:0%
um so I'll probably be working so I'm
 
05:30:40.510 --> 05:30:40.520 align:start position:0%
very old because of that that fault it
 
05:30:43.708 --> 05:30:43.718 align:start position:0%
is my understanding that um these types
 
05:30:46.708 --> 05:30:46.718 align:start position:0%
of organizations are governed by
 
05:30:51.708 --> 05:30:51.718 align:start position:0%
Internal Revenue Service um code and so
 
05:30:53.910 --> 05:30:53.920 align:start position:0%
my my assumption is that these
 
05:30:55.948 --> 05:30:55.958 align:start position:0%
organizations have to provide a
 
05:30:59.230 --> 05:30:59.240 align:start position:0%
financial audit uh in order to make sure
 
05:31:01.110 --> 05:31:01.120 align:start position:0%
that they're complying with the with the
 
05:31:04.628 --> 05:31:04.638 align:start position:0%
law so I would expect that that um that
 
05:31:07.510 --> 05:31:07.520 align:start position:0%
portion of the operation of the
 
05:31:09.830 --> 05:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
organization is uh is governed by
 
05:31:13.470 --> 05:31:13.480 align:start position:0%
federal law uh more so than uh State
 
05:31:15.670 --> 05:31:15.680 align:start position:0%
Authority thank you representative and
 
05:31:17.430 --> 05:31:17.440 align:start position:0%
and Mr chairman a
 
05:31:21.628 --> 05:31:21.638 align:start position:0%
followup thank you um the eligible
 
05:31:23.948 --> 05:31:23.958 align:start position:0%
students um and I'm I'm looking now at
 
05:31:26.190 --> 05:31:26.200 align:start position:0%
the front of the bill so this is back um
 
05:31:30.750 --> 05:31:30.760 align:start position:0%
on I suppose it's page one um l starting
 
05:31:32.230 --> 05:31:32.240 align:start position:0%
at line
 
05:31:35.548 --> 05:31:35.558 align:start position:0%
10 um but I guess the most important
 
05:31:37.150 --> 05:31:37.160 align:start position:0%
piece there is just eligible student
 
05:31:39.350 --> 05:31:39.360 align:start position:0%
means a resident of a school district
 
05:31:40.830 --> 05:31:40.840 align:start position:0%
that adopts the provisions of this
 
05:31:42.868 --> 05:31:42.878 align:start position:0%
chapter who is at least five years of
 
05:31:44.548 --> 05:31:44.558 align:start position:0%
age not more than 20 years of age who
 
05:31:46.510 --> 05:31:46.520 align:start position:0%
has not graduated from high school and
 
05:31:49.030 --> 05:31:49.040 align:start position:0%
is uh currently attending a public
 
05:31:50.548 --> 05:31:50.558 align:start position:0%
school cleaning a chartered a
 
05:31:53.310 --> 05:31:53.320 align:start position:0%
kindergarten student or receiving home
 
05:31:56.990 --> 05:31:57.000 align:start position:0%
education so uh I guess I have uh two
 
05:31:59.070 --> 05:31:59.080 align:start position:0%
sort of questions based on this I find
 
05:32:02.190 --> 05:32:02.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:05.670 --> 05:32:05.680 align:start position:0%
a going forward a student can utilize I
 
05:32:07.270 --> 05:32:07.280 align:start position:0%
just want to be clear on this going
 
05:32:11.708 --> 05:32:11.718 align:start position:0%
forward a student can utilize the EFA to
 
05:32:14.708 --> 05:32:14.718 align:start position:0%
pay tuition towards a private school but
 
05:32:19.110 --> 05:32:19.120 align:start position:0%
a student currently in private school is
 
05:32:22.470 --> 05:32:22.480 align:start position:0%
not eligible for the EFA is that
 
05:32:25.830 --> 05:32:25.840 align:start position:0%
correct so the way the law is written is
 
05:32:28.990 --> 05:32:29.000 align:start position:0%
you have to be um either a a member of
 
05:32:31.910 --> 05:32:31.920 align:start position:0%
the school of of age um or or a
 
05:32:34.270 --> 05:32:34.280 align:start position:0%
homeschool so if you are currently
 
05:32:36.750 --> 05:32:36.760 align:start position:0%
already in a private school correct you
 
05:32:39.548 --> 05:32:39.558 align:start position:0%
are not uh you are not captured in this
 
05:32:43.150 --> 05:32:43.160 align:start position:0%
in this bill okay and final question um
 
05:32:44.990 --> 05:32:45.000 align:start position:0%
I know that you had some uh data that
 
05:32:46.990 --> 05:32:47.000 align:start position:0%
you had worked up on um I think your
 
05:32:49.270 --> 05:32:49.280 align:start position:0%
hometown of Deerfield and the number of
 
05:32:52.868 --> 05:32:52.878 align:start position:0%
students um how many students currently
 
05:32:55.390 --> 05:32:55.400 align:start position:0%
uh in Deerfield are
 
05:32:57.590 --> 05:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
homeschooled um and would be eligible
 
05:32:59.270 --> 05:32:59.280 align:start position:0%
for the EFA and what would be the amount
 
05:33:02.430 --> 05:33:02.440 align:start position:0%
of money then that Deerfield um would be
 
05:33:04.070 --> 05:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
subtracting approximately from its
 
05:33:06.270 --> 05:33:06.280 align:start position:0%
budget for the following
 
05:33:08.788 --> 05:33:08.798 align:start position:0%
year so that's a very thank you
 
05:33:10.230 --> 05:33:10.240 align:start position:0%
representative for the question that's a
 
05:33:13.350 --> 05:33:13.360 align:start position:0%
very good question and that is not an
 
05:33:16.628 --> 05:33:16.638 align:start position:0%
easy um answer to arrive at as I'm sure
 
05:33:20.548 --> 05:33:20.558 align:start position:0%
you are aware um because there is no uh
 
05:33:22.310 --> 05:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
requirement any longer that a
 
05:33:25.270 --> 05:33:25.280 align:start position:0%
homeschooling family uh notify the Local
 
05:33:26.868 --> 05:33:26.878 align:start position:0%
District that's my understanding that
 
05:33:28.708 --> 05:33:28.718 align:start position:0%
they may choose to to notify the
 
05:33:30.470 --> 05:33:30.480 align:start position:0%
Department of Education
 
05:33:34.390 --> 05:33:34.400 align:start position:0%
uh in Li of um of their local District
 
05:33:37.510 --> 05:33:37.520 align:start position:0%
uh homeschooling numbers
 
05:33:41.030 --> 05:33:41.040 align:start position:0%
uh from an informal perspective right
 
05:33:42.628 --> 05:33:42.638 align:start position:0%
because I've been after that number for
 
05:33:45.190 --> 05:33:45.200 align:start position:0%
quite some time actually for for other
 
05:33:47.830 --> 05:33:47.840 align:start position:0%
reasons um it's it's a very interesting
 
05:33:49.750 --> 05:33:49.760 align:start position:0%
subject because certain communities have
 
05:33:52.548 --> 05:33:52.558 align:start position:0%
much higher rates of homeschooling than
 
05:33:55.230 --> 05:33:55.240 align:start position:0%
other communities and it's not clear to
 
05:33:59.590 --> 05:33:59.600 align:start position:0%
me what what drives that um and so I
 
05:34:02.270 --> 05:34:02.280 align:start position:0%
can't give an honest answer I don't know
 
05:34:04.430 --> 05:34:04.440 align:start position:0%
for sure I could guess I could give a
 
05:34:06.990 --> 05:34:07.000 align:start position:0%
guess number um based on people I've
 
05:34:08.670 --> 05:34:08.680 align:start position:0%
talked to and what I'm aware of but I
 
05:34:11.310 --> 05:34:11.320 align:start position:0%
would I would prefer not to to guess um
 
05:34:13.350 --> 05:34:13.360 align:start position:0%
in a public hearing but certainly if um
 
05:34:15.230 --> 05:34:15.240 align:start position:0%
if you wanted to pursue it further as a
 
05:34:17.150 --> 05:34:17.160 align:start position:0%
private discussion I I would entertain
 
05:34:19.510 --> 05:34:19.520 align:start position:0%
that so one of the difficulties then I
 
05:34:21.430 --> 05:34:21.440 align:start position:0%
guess would be trying to estimate what
 
05:34:24.670 --> 05:34:24.680 align:start position:0%
the uh impact of this would be upon any
 
05:34:26.948 --> 05:34:26.958 align:start position:0%
local um Local District including your
 
05:34:28.470 --> 05:34:28.480 align:start position:0%
own at this point because we don't have
 
05:34:30.868 --> 05:34:30.878 align:start position:0%
those numbers is that correct
 
05:34:33.230 --> 05:34:33.240 align:start position:0%
uh I don't don't agree with that so I
 
05:34:36.270 --> 05:34:36.280 align:start position:0%
believe that if a uh so for a local
 
05:34:38.548 --> 05:34:38.558 align:start position:0%
District such as my own or any other
 
05:34:41.390 --> 05:34:41.400 align:start position:0%
they would have the number of declared
 
05:34:43.708 --> 05:34:43.718 align:start position:0%
homeschoolers in their community that
 
05:34:46.670 --> 05:34:46.680 align:start position:0%
notified to the Local District um I
 
05:34:48.590 --> 05:34:48.600 align:start position:0%
would assume that if an inquiry was made
 
05:34:50.390 --> 05:34:50.400 align:start position:0%
to the Department of Education not
 
05:34:52.910 --> 05:34:52.920 align:start position:0%
necessarily for names and addresses uh
 
05:34:54.350 --> 05:34:54.360 align:start position:0%
but for the number of students
 
05:34:56.910 --> 05:34:56.920 align:start position:0%
participating in homeschooling um that
 
05:34:58.868 --> 05:34:58.878 align:start position:0%
would have a home address within the
 
05:35:01.310 --> 05:35:01.320 align:start position:0%
district uh that number could be
 
05:35:02.750 --> 05:35:02.760 align:start position:0%
generated rather quickly from the
 
05:35:04.830 --> 05:35:04.840 align:start position:0%
Department of Education and that would
 
05:35:08.708 --> 05:35:08.718 align:start position:0%
give you a maximum number of potential
 
05:35:11.070 --> 05:35:11.080 align:start position:0%
participants um you know as we heard
 
05:35:13.350 --> 05:35:13.360 align:start position:0%
with House Bill 20 um there's a
 
05:35:15.390 --> 05:35:15.400 align:start position:0%
significant portion of homeschool
 
05:35:17.670 --> 05:35:17.680 align:start position:0%
families that probably would not be
 
05:35:19.830 --> 05:35:19.840 align:start position:0%
interested in participating in these
 
05:35:22.708 --> 05:35:22.718 align:start position:0%
programs for various reasons so you can
 
05:35:24.750 --> 05:35:24.760 align:start position:0%
worst case it to say every homeschooler
 
05:35:26.750 --> 05:35:26.760 align:start position:0%
would come into the program uh but I
 
05:35:28.868 --> 05:35:28.878 align:start position:0%
think I think testimony that we've heard
 
05:35:30.628 --> 05:35:30.638 align:start position:0%
indicates that that would not uh that
 
05:35:33.708 --> 05:35:33.718 align:start position:0%
would not be the be the fact be the case
 
05:35:37.470 --> 05:35:37.480 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you are there further
 
05:35:39.750 --> 05:35:39.760 align:start position:0%
questions we have others that would like
 
05:35:42.190 --> 05:35:42.200 align:start position:0%
to that are out in the general public
 
05:35:44.270 --> 05:35:44.280 align:start position:0%
represent Mullen
 
05:35:50.548 --> 05:35:50.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:53.190 --> 05:35:53.200 align:start position:0%
again M you got your hand up but you've
 
05:35:55.030 --> 05:35:55.040 align:start position:0%
asked quite a few questions already and
 
05:35:57.270 --> 05:35:57.280 align:start position:0%
we do have I do I I just the only reason
 
05:35:59.350 --> 05:35:59.360 align:start position:0%
I'm uh asking for permission to follow
 
05:36:02.868 --> 05:36:02.878 align:start position:0%
up uh Mr chair is because representative
 
05:36:05.190 --> 05:36:05.200 align:start position:0%
verville sort of pointed me to the fine
 
05:36:08.708 --> 05:36:08.718 align:start position:0%
print and uh so I just wanted to ask him
 
05:36:10.470 --> 05:36:10.480 align:start position:0%
a follow-up question based on what he
 
05:36:12.510 --> 05:36:12.520 align:start position:0%
had shared with
 
05:36:17.670 --> 05:36:17.680 align:start position:0%
me repres do you have that response to
 
05:36:19.910 --> 05:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
that H well I'm not sure what her
 
05:36:21.708 --> 05:36:21.718 align:start position:0%
question is to be honest with you Mr
 
05:36:24.310 --> 05:36:24.320 align:start position:0%
chairman my question has to do with we
 
05:36:26.270 --> 05:36:26.280 align:start position:0%
were discussing representative thank you
 
05:36:28.590 --> 05:36:28.600 align:start position:0%
very much for indulging me here uh we
 
05:36:31.910 --> 05:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
were discussing the auditing portion of
 
05:36:34.548 --> 05:36:34.558 align:start position:0%
the program and who would be responsible
 
05:36:34.558 --> 05:36:37.750 align:start position:0%
the program and who would be responsible
for

05:36:37.750 --> 05:36:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:40.110 --> 05:36:40.120 align:start position:0%
Monitor and I think what I have
 
05:36:41.990 --> 05:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
discovered in the bill is that um it's
 
05:36:44.430 --> 05:36:44.440 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education that would
 
05:36:46.470 --> 05:36:46.480 align:start position:0%
be determining whether or not somebody
 
05:36:50.110 --> 05:36:50.120 align:start position:0%
is uh compliant that could move remove a
 
05:36:51.628 --> 05:36:51.638 align:start position:0%
student if they were
 
05:36:54.030 --> 05:36:54.040 align:start position:0%
non-compliant that would do an annual
 
05:36:56.150 --> 05:36:56.160 align:start position:0%
audit to all of those things are on page
 
05:36:59.350 --> 05:36:59.360 align:start position:0%
four in your bill um so my question to
 
05:37:02.270 --> 05:37:02.280 align:start position:0%
you is have you uh worked with the
 
05:37:04.830 --> 05:37:04.840 align:start position:0%
Department of Education to determine how
 
05:37:07.708 --> 05:37:07.718 align:start position:0%
many people it would take to be able to
 
05:37:09.270 --> 05:37:09.280 align:start position:0%
staff the
 
05:37:12.510 --> 05:37:12.520 align:start position:0%
program at their thank you Mr chair
 
05:37:13.830 --> 05:37:13.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
05:37:16.430 --> 05:37:16.440 align:start position:0%
representative Mullen for the question
 
05:37:19.270 --> 05:37:19.280 align:start position:0%
um the specific question that you just
 
05:37:22.628 --> 05:37:22.638 align:start position:0%
asked me I did not ask the Department of
 
05:37:27.470 --> 05:37:27.480 align:start position:0%
Education um I certainly um did review
 
05:37:30.390 --> 05:37:30.400 align:start position:0%
uh draft language of the bill um with
 
05:37:33.270 --> 05:37:33.280 align:start position:0%
the commissioner of education and and
 
05:37:35.948 --> 05:37:35.958 align:start position:0%
others uh in that department uh to make
 
05:37:38.510 --> 05:37:38.520 align:start position:0%
sure that they were uh aware of it and
 
05:37:40.670 --> 05:37:40.680 align:start position:0%
so that they would have the opportunity
 
05:37:44.150 --> 05:37:44.160 align:start position:0%
to provide input if they chose to um or
 
05:37:46.788 --> 05:37:46.798 align:start position:0%
potentially raise Red Flags uh Before
 
05:37:49.150 --> 05:37:49.160 align:start position:0%
the bill was filed so you know obviously
 
05:37:51.310 --> 05:37:51.320 align:start position:0%
I don't want to Blindside the department
 
05:37:52.830 --> 05:37:52.840 align:start position:0%
with uh with something that's going to
 
05:37:55.510 --> 05:37:55.520 align:start position:0%
be overly combersome um so I didn't ask
 
05:37:57.590 --> 05:37:57.600 align:start position:0%
that specific question they didn't they
 
05:38:00.470 --> 05:38:00.480 align:start position:0%
didn't raise that as a concern with me
 
05:38:02.310 --> 05:38:02.320 align:start position:0%
um so that's really the best answer that
 
05:38:04.470 --> 05:38:04.480 align:start position:0%
I can provide you oh that's fine thank
 
05:38:07.030 --> 05:38:07.040 align:start position:0%
you so very much for taking my question
 
05:38:08.628 --> 05:38:08.638 align:start position:0%
thank you my pleasure thank
 
05:38:11.590 --> 05:38:11.600 align:start position:0%
you I I would like to now start if we
 
05:38:14.830 --> 05:38:14.840 align:start position:0%
could um with others who would like to
 
05:38:16.910 --> 05:38:16.920 align:start position:0%
testify that are on the house remote
 
05:38:20.628 --> 05:38:20.638 align:start position:0%
testifying sheets um are there any more
 
05:38:22.830 --> 05:38:22.840 align:start position:0%
questions possibly from an individual
 
05:38:25.430 --> 05:38:25.440 align:start position:0%
who's not spoken as a Committee Member
 
05:38:27.270 --> 05:38:27.280 align:start position:0%
at this
 
05:38:31.510 --> 05:38:31.520 align:start position:0%
point not seeing yes I have a I have a
 
05:38:35.190 --> 05:38:35.200 align:start position:0%
point of information for the chair yes
 
05:38:37.230 --> 05:38:37.240 align:start position:0%
yes so so as we're um I think
 
05:38:40.030 --> 05:38:40.040 align:start position:0%
transitioning now to uh to taking
 
05:38:42.350 --> 05:38:42.360 align:start position:0%
testimony from members of the public I
 
05:38:45.110 --> 05:38:45.120 align:start position:0%
was wondering if um if members of the
 
05:38:47.990 --> 05:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
public would be able to have access to u
 
05:38:51.868 --> 05:38:51.878 align:start position:0%
to the signup sheet so that U uh people
 
05:38:54.030 --> 05:38:54.040 align:start position:0%
who believe they've signed up could
 
05:38:57.310 --> 05:38:57.320 align:start position:0%
indeed confirm um that uh that they're
 
05:38:58.430 --> 05:38:58.440 align:start position:0%
on your
 
05:38:58.440 --> 05:39:03.628 align:start position:0%
on your
list

05:39:03.628 --> 05:39:03.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:08.190 --> 05:39:08.200 align:start position:0%
the house cler us be taken of midnight
 
05:39:10.788 --> 05:39:10.798 align:start position:0%
last night yeah what I'm being informed
 
05:39:12.390 --> 05:39:12.400 align:start position:0%
that the house clerk we've already met
 
05:39:14.390 --> 05:39:14.400 align:start position:0%
with the house Clerk and the house clerk
 
05:39:18.468 --> 05:39:18.478 align:start position:0%
is addressing this issue we do have uh
 
05:39:20.708 --> 05:39:20.718 align:start position:0%
sheets in front of us we do know that we
 
05:39:24.350 --> 05:39:24.360 align:start position:0%
have on the written testimony sheet
 
05:39:27.830 --> 05:39:27.840 align:start position:0%
people how how many I didn't hear we do
 
05:39:30.350 --> 05:39:30.360 align:start position:0%
have on the sheet that I've been
 
05:39:31.788 --> 05:39:31.798 align:start position:0%
provided here I'm holding up of course
 
05:39:34.190 --> 05:39:34.200 align:start position:0%
you can't see it but it's there that we
 
05:39:38.230 --> 05:39:38.240 align:start position:0%
have a total of supporting this uh 36
 
05:39:42.830 --> 05:39:42.840 align:start position:0%
people opposed to 658 neutral to and
 
05:39:46.868 --> 05:39:46.878 align:start position:0%

05:41:44.750 --> 05:41:44.760 align:start position:0%
Amry Banfield and I'm an advocate for
 
05:41:46.468 --> 05:41:46.478 align:start position:0%
parental rights and academic excellence
 
05:41:49.590 --> 05:41:49.600 align:start position:0%
and education today I do come here to
 
05:41:53.230 --> 05:41:53.240 align:start position:0%
testify in House Bill 607 I did sign in
 
05:41:55.070 --> 05:41:55.080 align:start position:0%
as neutral on the bill however I do
 
05:41:57.468 --> 05:41:57.478 align:start position:0%
support the essence of what HB 607 is
 
05:42:00.150 --> 05:42:00.160 align:start position:0%
trying to accomplish the only concerns I
 
05:42:03.430 --> 05:42:03.440 align:start position:0%
have would be that HB 607 needs to carve
 
05:42:05.030 --> 05:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
out a provision that protects the
 
05:42:07.468 --> 05:42:07.478 align:start position:0%
autonomy of the private parochial and
 
05:42:07.478 --> 05:42:09.190 align:start position:0%
autonomy of the private parochial and
homeschool

05:42:09.190 --> 05:42:09.200 align:start position:0%
homeschool
 
05:42:11.788 --> 05:42:11.798 align:start position:0%
Community if that is added to the bill
 
05:42:13.590 --> 05:42:13.600 align:start position:0%
as an amendment it would be I would be
 
05:42:17.110 --> 05:42:17.120 align:start position:0%
in support of a to pass on House Bill
 
05:42:19.510 --> 05:42:19.520 align:start position:0%
607 uh I've heard opponents of school
 
05:42:20.910 --> 05:42:20.920 align:start position:0%
choice legislation bring up the
 
05:42:22.990 --> 05:42:23.000 align:start position:0%
importance of accountability and I would
 
05:42:24.910 --> 05:42:24.920 align:start position:0%
agree that accountability is important
 
05:42:28.270 --> 05:42:28.280 align:start position:0%
especially to parents I would agree that
 
05:42:30.430 --> 05:42:30.440 align:start position:0%
if you speak in terms of local control
 
05:42:32.070 --> 05:42:32.080 align:start position:0%
that's exactly what accountability is
 
05:42:33.708 --> 05:42:33.718 align:start position:0%
supposed to do allow for the local
 
05:42:35.628 --> 05:42:35.638 align:start position:0%
community parents to hold their
 
05:42:37.390 --> 05:42:37.400 align:start position:0%
institutions of learning
 
05:42:39.548 --> 05:42:39.558 align:start position:0%
accountable let's not seek to hold
 
05:42:41.310 --> 05:42:41.320 align:start position:0%
private parochial and homeschools
 
05:42:43.150 --> 05:42:43.160 align:start position:0%
accountable to the state but instead
 
05:42:46.030 --> 05:42:46.040 align:start position:0%
trust parents all children who are not
 
05:42:48.150 --> 05:42:48.160 align:start position:0%
served by any educational institution
 
05:42:50.190 --> 05:42:50.200 align:start position:0%
should have the ability to find a school
 
05:42:52.110 --> 05:42:52.120 align:start position:0%
that serves their needs not just
 
05:42:55.230 --> 05:42:55.240 align:start position:0%
children from wealthy F families so when
 
05:42:57.948 --> 05:42:57.958 align:start position:0%
it comes to school choice oftentimes
 
05:42:59.990 --> 05:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
there are two sides
 
05:43:02.430 --> 05:43:02.440 align:start position:0%
those who want to focus on school choice
 
05:43:03.948 --> 05:43:03.958 align:start position:0%
and those who want to focus on the loss
 
05:43:06.270 --> 05:43:06.280 align:start position:0%
of funding but there are many of us like
 
05:43:08.190 --> 05:43:08.200 align:start position:0%
me who understand the value in a
 
05:43:09.708 --> 05:43:09.718 align:start position:0%
balanced approach to improving the
 
05:43:12.390 --> 05:43:12.400 align:start position:0%
quality of education for all children
 
05:43:14.390 --> 05:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
many of you know me as a strong advocate
 
05:43:16.670 --> 05:43:16.680 align:start position:0%
for public schools in New Hampshire as a
 
05:43:19.110 --> 05:43:19.120 align:start position:0%
researcher of Public public education
 
05:43:21.030 --> 05:43:21.040 align:start position:0%
the consensus has been that parents want
 
05:43:22.548 --> 05:43:22.558 align:start position:0%
their children to attend their
 
05:43:24.230 --> 05:43:24.240 align:start position:0%
neighborhood public school just as the
 
05:43:26.708 --> 05:43:26.718 align:start position:0%
sponsor mentioned everything that I have
 
05:43:29.670 --> 05:43:29.680 align:start position:0%
read when you offer good quality Public
 
05:43:32.070 --> 05:43:32.080 align:start position:0%
Schools that's where parents choose
 
05:43:33.788 --> 05:43:33.798 align:start position:0%
that's where they normally want to send
 
05:43:33.798 --> 05:43:34.750 align:start position:0%
that's where they normally want to send
their

05:43:34.750 --> 05:43:34.760 align:start position:0%
their
 
05:43:37.230 --> 05:43:37.240 align:start position:0%
children that is why it is critical that
 
05:43:40.070 --> 05:43:40.080 align:start position:0%
we make excellence and education public
 
05:43:43.830 --> 05:43:43.840 align:start position:0%
education a priority right now a school
 
05:43:46.510 --> 05:43:46.520 align:start position:0%
superintendent can redirect public funds
 
05:43:49.030 --> 05:43:49.040 align:start position:0%
to private and religious schools if they
 
05:43:51.270 --> 05:43:51.280 align:start position:0%
feel the child would be better served
 
05:43:53.548 --> 05:43:53.558 align:start position:0%
outside that Public School District
 
05:43:55.670 --> 05:43:55.680 align:start position:0%
that's an example of all stakeholders
 
05:43:58.030 --> 05:43:58.040 align:start position:0%
coming together to prioritize the needs
 
05:44:00.150 --> 05:44:00.160 align:start position:0%
of the child
 
05:44:02.230 --> 05:44:02.240 align:start position:0%
this is why I also supported parents
 
05:44:04.310 --> 05:44:04.320 align:start position:0%
when they spoke out against education
 
05:44:07.110 --> 05:44:07.120 align:start position:0%
reforms like Common Core parents want
 
05:44:08.990 --> 05:44:09.000 align:start position:0%
their children to remain in the public
 
05:44:11.190 --> 05:44:11.200 align:start position:0%
school system but could see the serious
 
05:44:13.350 --> 05:44:13.360 align:start position:0%
flaws that came with the new standards
 
05:44:15.030 --> 05:44:15.040 align:start position:0%
they wanted their children in their
 
05:44:16.948 --> 05:44:16.958 align:start position:0%
public school and found a way to improve
 
05:44:19.628 --> 05:44:19.638 align:start position:0%
the quality of Education unfortunately
 
05:44:21.990 --> 05:44:22.000 align:start position:0%
their desperation fell on deaf ears and
 
05:44:23.590 --> 05:44:23.600 align:start position:0%
many of those parents did remove their
 
05:44:25.910 --> 05:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
children from the public schools so
 
05:44:27.868 --> 05:44:27.878 align:start position:0%
those who say they want everyone to work
 
05:44:30.310 --> 05:44:30.320 align:start position:0%
to make Public Schools better watch
 
05:44:33.030 --> 05:44:33.040 align:start position:0%
parents give that their Valiant effort
 
05:44:35.230 --> 05:44:35.240 align:start position:0%
this is where we are falling short
 
05:44:37.510 --> 05:44:37.520 align:start position:0%
seeing good parents stand up to push for
 
05:44:39.310 --> 05:44:39.320 align:start position:0%
excellence in their Public Schools but
 
05:44:41.150 --> 05:44:41.160 align:start position:0%
then not receiving enough support to
 
05:44:43.430 --> 05:44:43.440 align:start position:0%
help them make those improvements how
 
05:44:44.990 --> 05:44:45.000 align:start position:0%
can you say that you support public
 
05:44:46.910 --> 05:44:46.920 align:start position:0%
education then turn your backs on
 
05:44:49.230 --> 05:44:49.240 align:start position:0%
parents who are putting in the efforts
 
05:44:51.030 --> 05:44:51.040 align:start position:0%
making our Public Schools the best in
 
05:44:53.150 --> 05:44:53.160 align:start position:0%
the country would still be our FOC
 
05:44:54.868 --> 05:44:54.878 align:start position:0%
should still be our focus and I haven't
 
05:44:57.350 --> 05:44:57.360 align:start position:0%
given up when we work together to make
 
05:44:59.468 --> 05:44:59.478 align:start position:0%
the public schools great parents are not
 
05:45:02.150 --> 05:45:02.160 align:start position:0%
forced into looking for other options
 
05:45:03.548 --> 05:45:03.558 align:start position:0%
now that many of our schools in New
 
05:45:05.590 --> 05:45:05.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire have closed or are offering
 
05:45:08.110 --> 05:45:08.120 align:start position:0%
hybrid hybrid learning parents are once
 
05:45:10.430 --> 05:45:10.440 align:start position:0%
again fighting to reopening their public
 
05:45:13.350 --> 05:45:13.360 align:start position:0%
schools for their children I'm involved
 
05:45:15.110 --> 05:45:15.120 align:start position:0%
with these groups of parents throughout
 
05:45:17.110 --> 05:45:17.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire every day I hear from
 
05:45:18.910 --> 05:45:18.920 align:start position:0%
parents in some of your districts
 
05:45:20.830 --> 05:45:20.840 align:start position:0%
sharing how difficult the shutdowns have
 
05:45:22.070 --> 05:45:22.080 align:start position:0%
been on their
 
05:45:25.468 --> 05:45:25.478 align:start position:0%
children so sa so safe it needs to be
 
05:45:28.030 --> 05:45:28.040 align:start position:0%
open safely some children are doing well
 
05:45:29.510 --> 05:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
under these circumstan an es but there
 
05:45:31.390 --> 05:45:31.400 align:start position:0%
is a large population of children who
 
05:45:34.190 --> 05:45:34.200 align:start position:0%
are not my priority is quality Public
 
05:45:36.350 --> 05:45:36.360 align:start position:0%
Schools but when children are suffering
 
05:45:38.310 --> 05:45:38.320 align:start position:0%
I will not ignore their voices and I
 
05:45:41.350 --> 05:45:41.360 align:start position:0%
encourage you to not ignore them either
 
05:45:43.150 --> 05:45:43.160 align:start position:0%
right now parents want their children in
 
05:45:45.390 --> 05:45:45.400 align:start position:0%
front of a teacher and not a computer
 
05:45:47.830 --> 05:45:47.840 align:start position:0%
screen right now they want their kids in
 
05:45:50.230 --> 05:45:50.240 align:start position:0%
a public school but like Common Core
 
05:45:51.990 --> 05:45:52.000 align:start position:0%
they are finding out that those who want
 
05:45:54.788 --> 05:45:54.798 align:start position:0%
to support public education are again
 
05:45:54.798 --> 05:45:55.948 align:start position:0%
to support public education are again
being

05:45:55.948 --> 05:45:55.958 align:start position:0%
being
 
05:45:58.868 --> 05:45:58.878 align:start position:0%
ignored school school choice options are
 
05:46:00.350 --> 05:46:00.360 align:start position:0%
needed for a small number of children
 
05:46:03.150 --> 05:46:03.160 align:start position:0%
during normal times those families need
 
05:46:06.030 --> 05:46:06.040 align:start position:0%
to be heard and respected you represent
 
05:46:08.190 --> 05:46:08.200 align:start position:0%
all families in your District the need
 
05:46:10.510 --> 05:46:10.520 align:start position:0%
is even greater right now due the
 
05:46:13.310 --> 05:46:13.320 align:start position:0%
shutdowns once schools open and if they
 
05:46:15.948 --> 05:46:15.958 align:start position:0%
return to a model of Excellence many of
 
05:46:18.390 --> 05:46:18.400 align:start position:0%
those children will return I know these
 
05:46:20.270 --> 05:46:20.280 align:start position:0%
parents they want their kids in a public
 
05:46:22.990 --> 05:46:23.000 align:start position:0%
school no one should fear though helping
 
05:46:25.468 --> 05:46:25.478 align:start position:0%
children who need help right now when
 
05:46:27.590 --> 05:46:27.600 align:start position:0%
public schools are at their best parents
 
05:46:30.468 --> 05:46:30.478 align:start position:0%
will choose them for their kid kids I'll
 
05:46:32.590 --> 05:46:32.600 align:start position:0%
give you an example prior to Common Core
 
05:46:34.910 --> 05:46:34.920 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts students were competing
 
05:46:36.788 --> 05:46:36.798 align:start position:0%
with children in the highest performing
 
05:46:38.788 --> 05:46:38.798 align:start position:0%
countries because the focus was on
 
05:46:40.788 --> 05:46:40.798 align:start position:0%
offering parents the best public schools
 
05:46:43.270 --> 05:46:43.280 align:start position:0%
in the country parents wanted and
 
05:46:46.230 --> 05:46:46.240 align:start position:0%
appreciated their Public Schools even if
 
05:46:47.910 --> 05:46:47.920 align:start position:0%
there were other options for children
 
05:46:50.030 --> 05:46:50.040 align:start position:0%
who needed it the public schools were an
 
05:46:51.868 --> 05:46:51.878 align:start position:0%
excellent choice for their children and
 
05:46:54.868 --> 05:46:54.878 align:start position:0%
parents knew it if you talk to them they
 
05:46:57.990 --> 05:46:58.000 align:start position:0%
knew it you don't force parents to stay
 
05:46:59.868 --> 05:46:59.878 align:start position:0%
in a school that is not working for
 
05:47:01.990 --> 05:47:02.000 align:start position:0%
their children you find ways to improve
 
05:47:03.830 --> 05:47:03.840 align:start position:0%
the school so that the public school is
 
05:47:06.230 --> 05:47:06.240 align:start position:0%
their Top Choice you don't ignore
 
05:47:08.110 --> 05:47:08.120 align:start position:0%
parents who demand better standard for
 
05:47:10.310 --> 05:47:10.320 align:start position:0%
their children you don't ignore parents
 
05:47:11.830 --> 05:47:11.840 align:start position:0%
whose children need in-person
 
05:47:14.030 --> 05:47:14.040 align:start position:0%
interaction with their teacher instead
 
05:47:17.750 --> 05:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
of through an iPad you act that's
 
05:47:19.468 --> 05:47:19.478 align:start position:0%
supporting public schools and that's
 
05:47:22.990 --> 05:47:23.000 align:start position:0%
supporting parents finally during his
 
05:47:25.430 --> 05:47:25.440 align:start position:0%
Connecticut confirmation hearing M
 
05:47:28.150 --> 05:47:28.160 align:start position:0%
Miguel Cardona the newly appointed US
 
05:47:30.070 --> 05:47:30.080 align:start position:0%
Secretary of of Education in the Biden
 
05:47:32.150 --> 05:47:32.160 align:start position:0%
Administration responded to a question
 
05:47:34.510 --> 05:47:34.520 align:start position:0%
about charter schools by saying Charter
 
05:47:37.190 --> 05:47:37.200 align:start position:0%
Schools provide choice for parents that
 
05:47:40.310 --> 05:47:40.320 align:start position:0%
are seeking choice I think it's a viable
 
05:47:43.270 --> 05:47:43.280 align:start position:0%
option and according to edweek Cardona
 
05:47:45.350 --> 05:47:45.360 align:start position:0%
has been affiliated with new leaders
 
05:47:47.510 --> 05:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
where he participated in a fellowship
 
05:47:51.150 --> 05:47:51.160 align:start position:0%
program new leaders Embrace Embraces
 
05:47:55.190 --> 05:47:55.200 align:start position:0%
school choice new leader CEO Jane Des
 
05:47:58.708 --> 05:47:58.718 align:start position:0%
rvin said Miguel cares about kids who
 
05:48:00.868 --> 05:48:00.878 align:start position:0%
and kids who attend public schools and
 
05:48:03.830 --> 05:48:03.840 align:start position:0%
he wants to do everything he can to set
 
05:48:06.990 --> 05:48:07.000 align:start position:0%
those kids up for Success that balance
 
05:48:08.868 --> 05:48:08.878 align:start position:0%
perspective is what he will bring to
 
05:48:11.628 --> 05:48:11.638 align:start position:0%
this role so we can see that in this new
 
05:48:13.948 --> 05:48:13.958 align:start position:0%
Biden Administration officials are not
 
05:48:16.910 --> 05:48:16.920 align:start position:0%
taking taking a hard ST stand against
 
05:48:19.190 --> 05:48:19.200 align:start position:0%
school choice but instead have taken a
 
05:48:21.750 --> 05:48:21.760 align:start position:0%
more balanced approach it was during the
 
05:48:24.468 --> 05:48:24.478 align:start position:0%
Obama Administration that large sums of
 
05:48:25.990 --> 05:48:26.000 align:start position:0%
federal dollars were sent to New
 
05:48:28.788 --> 05:48:28.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and other states to expand
 
05:48:31.430 --> 05:48:31.440 align:start position:0%
Choice through charter schools so I ask
 
05:48:33.430 --> 05:48:33.440 align:start position:0%
you to take a more balanced approach to
 
05:48:35.948 --> 05:48:35.958 align:start position:0%
educating children K to 12 this
 
05:48:38.548 --> 05:48:38.558 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be an issue of one side versus
 
05:48:40.868 --> 05:48:40.878 align:start position:0%
the other this should be everyone
 
05:48:43.030 --> 05:48:43.040 align:start position:0%
putting aside partisan views and
 
05:48:44.990 --> 05:48:45.000 align:start position:0%
supporting parents who need that support
 
05:48:46.868 --> 05:48:46.878 align:start position:0%
for their children whether it be for
 
05:48:49.788 --> 05:48:49.798 align:start position:0%
funding improving standards opening
 
05:48:52.350 --> 05:48:52.360 align:start position:0%
schools or even offering other options
 
05:48:54.310 --> 05:48:54.320 align:start position:0%
for their children when you put the
 
05:48:56.750 --> 05:48:56.760 align:start position:0%
needs of all children above partisanship
 
05:48:58.670 --> 05:48:58.680 align:start position:0%
you can say that you are working for all
 
05:48:58.680 --> 05:48:59.430 align:start position:0%
you can say that you are working for all
your

05:48:59.430 --> 05:48:59.440 align:start position:0%
your
 
05:49:01.548 --> 05:49:01.558 align:start position:0%
constituents uh and I I thank you for
 
05:49:03.548 --> 05:49:03.558 align:start position:0%
your time and that is all I have to add
 
05:49:07.548 --> 05:49:07.558 align:start position:0%
for this thank you very much um I'm I'm
 
05:49:09.310 --> 05:49:09.320 align:start position:0%
gonna set it start from this point
 
05:49:11.510 --> 05:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
onwards I'm going to try to set a time
 
05:49:14.230 --> 05:49:14.240 align:start position:0%
limit here uh because we have people in
 
05:49:16.548 --> 05:49:16.558 align:start position:0%
in the Q or in the attendee list
 
05:49:18.390 --> 05:49:18.400 align:start position:0%
starting to put hands up as well as
 
05:49:21.270 --> 05:49:21.280 align:start position:0%
those which are already submitted uh
 
05:49:23.548 --> 05:49:23.558 align:start position:0%
request to testify so we'll we'll go to
 
05:49:26.350 --> 05:49:26.360 align:start position:0%
three minutes right now and we will have
 
05:49:27.750 --> 05:49:27.760 align:start position:0%
an individual here in the committee
 
05:49:29.230 --> 05:49:29.240 align:start position:0%
starting to
 
05:49:31.190 --> 05:49:31.200 align:start position:0%
uh keep track that time and give me the
 
05:49:33.590 --> 05:49:33.600 align:start position:0%
signal when it's uh the three minutes is
 
05:49:35.948 --> 05:49:35.958 align:start position:0%
up uh thank you very much
 
05:49:37.990 --> 05:49:38.000 align:start position:0%
represent Miss
 
05:49:41.670 --> 05:49:41.680 align:start position:0%
B okay next we have uh Michael betet and
 
05:49:43.590 --> 05:49:43.600 align:start position:0%
Michael you've been promoted so you can
 
05:49:45.430 --> 05:49:45.440 align:start position:0%
go ahead and
 
05:49:47.548 --> 05:49:47.558 align:start position:0%
speak everybody thank you for giving me
 
05:49:49.150 --> 05:49:49.160 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to speak on this I just
 
05:49:51.830 --> 05:49:51.840 align:start position:0%
wanted to to U ask a few things and and
 
05:49:53.430 --> 05:49:53.440 align:start position:0%
make a couple of very quick statements I
 
05:49:55.430 --> 05:49:55.440 align:start position:0%
understand my time limits first is is
 
05:49:57.030 --> 05:49:57.040 align:start position:0%
that I'm very concerned the bill doesn't
 
05:49:58.910 --> 05:49:58.920 align:start position:0%
offer any prohibitions that I could find
 
05:50:00.548 --> 05:50:00.558 align:start position:0%
in my reading of it that would prohibit
 
05:50:01.868 --> 05:50:01.878 align:start position:0%
individuals from double dipping
 
05:50:03.430 --> 05:50:03.440 align:start position:0%
insurance reimbursements for some of
 
05:50:05.708 --> 05:50:05.718 align:start position:0%
those services along with their grants
 
05:50:08.190 --> 05:50:08.200 align:start position:0%
I'm also curious to know how hb20 should
 
05:50:11.510 --> 05:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
it uh become um law would couple with
 
05:50:13.708 --> 05:50:13.718 align:start position:0%
this particular uh bill can you double
 
05:50:15.190 --> 05:50:15.200 align:start position:0%
dip if you will between those two
 
05:50:16.670 --> 05:50:16.680 align:start position:0%
accounts and potentially double the
 
05:50:18.910 --> 05:50:18.920 align:start position:0%
monies uh that are associated with that
 
05:50:20.110 --> 05:50:20.120 align:start position:0%
that's something that I didn't see any
 
05:50:21.628 --> 05:50:21.638 align:start position:0%
specifics to within the bill I perhaps
 
05:50:23.830 --> 05:50:23.840 align:start position:0%
maybe just missed it I think I'd like to
 
05:50:25.750 --> 05:50:25.760 align:start position:0%
take one moment just to rep to speak out
 
05:50:27.110 --> 05:50:27.120 align:start position:0%
directly to a comment made by
 
05:50:28.468 --> 05:50:28.478 align:start position:0%
representative veral when he was
 
05:50:30.110 --> 05:50:30.120 align:start position:0%
speaking to the issue of standardized
 
05:50:31.990 --> 05:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
testing and accountability I think the
 
05:50:33.468 --> 05:50:33.478 align:start position:0%
majority of my colleagues wouldn't be
 
05:50:35.030 --> 05:50:35.040 align:start position:0%
speaking about the accountability of
 
05:50:36.628 --> 05:50:36.638 align:start position:0%
State Testing in reference to the
 
05:50:38.230 --> 05:50:38.240 align:start position:0%
accountabilities that are associated
 
05:50:40.708 --> 05:50:40.718 align:start position:0%
with this particular bill I think that
 
05:50:42.510 --> 05:50:42.520 align:start position:0%
standardized tests have made themselves
 
05:50:44.868 --> 05:50:44.878 align:start position:0%
well known to be um very poor
 
05:50:47.310 --> 05:50:47.320 align:start position:0%
correlators of predictability of success
 
05:50:49.030 --> 05:50:49.040 align:start position:0%
for students particularly in New
 
05:50:50.948 --> 05:50:50.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is as probably representative
 
05:50:52.990 --> 05:50:53.000 align:start position:0%
Ville himself could to test um his
 
05:50:54.990 --> 05:50:55.000 align:start position:0%
success probably uh would speak to that
 
05:50:57.030 --> 05:50:57.040 align:start position:0%
I don't know what a standardized testing
 
05:50:59.468 --> 05:50:59.478 align:start position:0%
was but certainly um there's plenty of
 
05:51:00.948 --> 05:51:00.958 align:start position:0%
data out there that speaks to the lack
 
05:51:03.070 --> 05:51:03.080 align:start position:0%
of correlation between those two fiscal
 
05:51:05.270 --> 05:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
accountability is the issue of concern
 
05:51:07.468 --> 05:51:07.478 align:start position:0%
for us I think that when you look at the
 
05:51:09.310 --> 05:51:09.320 align:start position:0%
the ability to be fiscally accountable
 
05:51:12.910 --> 05:51:12.920 align:start position:0%
within this bill there lacks a a very
 
05:51:15.190 --> 05:51:15.200 align:start position:0%
large number of Staff members at the doe
 
05:51:17.628 --> 05:51:17.638 align:start position:0%
that would be able to uh effectively
 
05:51:20.510 --> 05:51:20.520 align:start position:0%
prohibit fraud most important of this uh
 
05:51:22.110 --> 05:51:22.120 align:start position:0%
for homeschoolers you know when we start
 
05:51:24.590 --> 05:51:24.600 align:start position:0%
looking at the reduction of adequacy
 
05:51:26.110 --> 05:51:26.120 align:start position:0%
funds that are associated with this bill
 
05:51:28.390 --> 05:51:28.400 align:start position:0%
and others um potentially within my own
 
05:51:29.868 --> 05:51:29.878 align:start position:0%
school district of kar we're looking at
 
05:51:32.670 --> 05:51:32.680 align:start position:0%
the reduction of about $1.3 million from
 
05:51:35.190 --> 05:51:35.200 align:start position:0%
the state's adequacy pool uh as a result
 
05:51:37.230 --> 05:51:37.240 align:start position:0%
of if all of our homeschooling students
 
05:51:39.468 --> 05:51:39.478 align:start position:0%
alone you could add another
 
05:51:42.030 --> 05:51:42.040 align:start position:0%
$650,000 to that number should the 50
 
05:51:44.590 --> 05:51:44.600 align:start position:0%
students uh that are uh taking Char
 
05:51:46.270 --> 05:51:46.280 align:start position:0%
private school enrollments right now
 
05:51:48.510 --> 05:51:48.520 align:start position:0%
cash in on those particular bills so the
 
05:51:51.628 --> 05:51:51.638 align:start position:0%
large number we're talking 1.5 to$ 1.7
 
05:51:53.310 --> 05:51:53.320 align:start position:0%
million dollars of adequacy funds that
 
05:51:54.948 --> 05:51:54.958 align:start position:0%
we drain from the state certainly are
 
05:51:56.990 --> 05:51:57.000 align:start position:0%
going to be uh Amplified against the
 
05:51:59.150 --> 05:51:59.160 align:start position:0%
total volume of students uh in the state
 
05:52:00.708 --> 05:52:00.718 align:start position:0%
and that's just going to exacerbate the
 
05:52:03.910 --> 05:52:03.920 align:start position:0%
already um woeful conditions around the
 
05:52:06.948 --> 05:52:06.958 align:start position:0%
state relative to school funding um and
 
05:52:08.430 --> 05:52:08.440 align:start position:0%
lastly I think I just want to make the
 
05:52:11.310 --> 05:52:11.320 align:start position:0%
point if I may that we've been you know
 
05:52:13.190 --> 05:52:13.200 align:start position:0%
very very very cautious about looking at
 
05:52:15.230 --> 05:52:15.240 align:start position:0%
making long-term decisions about
 
05:52:17.430 --> 05:52:17.440 align:start position:0%
covid-19 and how covid-19 should be
 
05:52:19.628 --> 05:52:19.638 align:start position:0%
looked at through the lens of choice
 
05:52:20.990 --> 05:52:21.000 align:start position:0%
through the lens of vouchers through the
 
05:52:23.270 --> 05:52:23.280 align:start position:0%
lens of other opportunities I just would
 
05:52:25.468 --> 05:52:25.478 align:start position:0%
ask us to all to be very cautious about
 
05:52:28.590 --> 05:52:28.600 align:start position:0%
applying long-term thinking around Co 19
 
05:52:29.948 --> 05:52:29.958 align:start position:0%
and the decisions that districts have
 
05:52:32.230 --> 05:52:32.240 align:start position:0%
had to make to stay viable um during the
 
05:52:34.150 --> 05:52:34.160 align:start position:0%
pandemic please don't use that as an
 
05:52:37.030 --> 05:52:37.040 align:start position:0%
excuse to make bad legislation thank you
 
05:52:40.390 --> 05:52:40.400 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there
 
05:52:44.788 --> 05:52:44.798 align:start position:0%
for not seeing hands up thank you very
 
05:52:48.430 --> 05:52:48.440 align:start position:0%
much next is okay U next I was looking
 
05:52:51.670 --> 05:52:51.680 align:start position:0%
for Cynthia Finn and I did not see her
 
05:52:54.830 --> 05:52:54.840 align:start position:0%
in the list um so I went down to our
 
05:52:57.590 --> 05:52:57.600 align:start position:0%
next elected official James oconnell I
 
05:53:00.868 --> 05:53:00.878 align:start position:0%
don't see in the list so I am looking
 
05:53:02.910 --> 05:53:02.920 align:start position:0%
for uh Kevin
 
05:53:07.270 --> 05:53:07.280 align:start position:0%
gravy and I did see him in the list so
 
05:53:12.230 --> 05:53:12.240 align:start position:0%
um did he just raise hand
 
05:53:27.150 --> 05:53:27.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:27.160 --> 05:53:29.230 align:start position:0%
 
Brady

05:53:29.230 --> 05:53:29.240 align:start position:0%
Brady
 
05:53:32.310 --> 05:53:32.320 align:start position:0%
see Hello can everybody hear me now yes
 
05:53:34.390 --> 05:53:34.400 align:start position:0%
yes okay great yes my my screen went
 
05:53:37.948 --> 05:53:37.958 align:start position:0%
blank there for for just a second um Mr
 
05:53:39.350 --> 05:53:39.360 align:start position:0%
chairman ladies and gentlemen of the
 
05:53:40.548 --> 05:53:40.558 align:start position:0%
committee thank you very much for the
 
05:53:42.270 --> 05:53:42.280 align:start position:0%
opportunity uh to give you some
 
05:53:44.310 --> 05:53:44.320 align:start position:0%
testimony today for the record my name
 
05:53:46.150 --> 05:53:46.160 align:start position:0%
is Kevin Grady and I'm a 22-year
 
05:53:48.548 --> 05:53:48.558 align:start position:0%
resident of the town of hooks at New
 
05:53:52.190 --> 05:53:52.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and uh I think that I have a a
 
05:53:53.990 --> 05:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
different perspective maybe on some of
 
05:53:55.628 --> 05:53:55.638 align:start position:0%
this than some of the other speakers
 
05:53:59.190 --> 05:53:59.200 align:start position:0%
that you might have heard from um I was
 
05:54:01.430 --> 05:54:01.440 align:start position:0%
a 25y year Air Force veteran spent the
 
05:54:02.750 --> 05:54:02.760 align:start position:0%
first five and a half years of my time
 
05:54:04.788 --> 05:54:04.798 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire as an airline pilot and
 
05:54:06.788 --> 05:54:06.798 align:start position:0%
then I finally took a job teaching in a
 
05:54:08.390 --> 05:54:08.400 align:start position:0%
public high school down at Alvin High
 
05:54:11.430 --> 05:54:11.440 align:start position:0%
School in SAU 81 in Hudson New Hampshire
 
05:54:13.670 --> 05:54:13.680 align:start position:0%
teaching Air Force Junior RC for 11
 
05:54:16.510 --> 05:54:16.520 align:start position:0%
school years so my perspective is a
 
05:54:18.548 --> 05:54:18.558 align:start position:0%
little bit different from other folks in
 
05:54:20.070 --> 05:54:20.080 align:start position:0%
that I didn't spend my whole life in
 
05:54:24.190 --> 05:54:24.200 align:start position:0%
Academia only about 25% of it um I was
 
05:54:26.230 --> 05:54:26.240 align:start position:0%
not in a union at any time when I was
 
05:54:27.868 --> 05:54:27.878 align:start position:0%
there so I don't have any preconceived
 
05:54:29.868 --> 05:54:29.878 align:start position:0%
not Notions about how any of this ought
 
05:54:32.150 --> 05:54:32.160 align:start position:0%
to work and additionally I've never had
 
05:54:34.390 --> 05:54:34.400 align:start position:0%
any children or grandchildren in the in
 
05:54:36.468 --> 05:54:36.478 align:start position:0%
this in either private school or public
 
05:54:38.788 --> 05:54:38.798 align:start position:0%
school in the state of New Hampshire so
 
05:54:44.510 --> 05:54:44.520 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to be as as uh um as kind of
 
05:54:48.750 --> 05:54:48.760 align:start position:0%
uh well let me move on um the I'd like
 
05:54:49.948 --> 05:54:49.958 align:start position:0%
to give you just a little bit of a
 
05:54:52.868 --> 05:54:52.878 align:start position:0%
cautionary tale for my 11 years uh as a
 
05:54:55.430 --> 05:54:55.440 align:start position:0%
as sort of an impartial juror down in uh
 
05:54:57.548 --> 05:54:57.558 align:start position:0%
in in at Alber High School in husin and
 
05:54:59.310 --> 05:54:59.320 align:start position:0%
I love time my time there and my
 
05:55:03.070 --> 05:55:03.080 align:start position:0%
colleagues uh were great but Hudson is
 
05:55:04.150 --> 05:55:04.160 align:start position:0%
in the top
 
05:55:08.110 --> 05:55:08.120 align:start position:0%
15% uh in the state of per capita income
 
05:55:10.750 --> 05:55:10.760 align:start position:0%
and yet they spend the the bottom 5% on
 
05:55:12.750 --> 05:55:12.760 align:start position:0%
their teacher salaries and the result of
 
05:55:14.190 --> 05:55:14.200 align:start position:0%
this is that every single year for the
 
05:55:16.110 --> 05:55:16.120 align:start position:0%
11 years that I taught the school board
 
05:55:18.190 --> 05:55:18.200 align:start position:0%
budget didn't pass and the reason it
 
05:55:20.510 --> 05:55:20.520 align:start position:0%
didn't pass is because a very small
 
05:55:22.708 --> 05:55:22.718 align:start position:0%
small small percentage of the folks went
 
05:55:26.190 --> 05:55:26.200 align:start position:0%
out to actually vote for this thing and
 
05:55:28.590 --> 05:55:28.600 align:start position:0%
because it didn't pass the the budget
 
05:55:30.708 --> 05:55:30.718 align:start position:0%
line pretty much stayed flat and because
 
05:55:33.590 --> 05:55:33.600 align:start position:0%
it didn't pass we ended up with being at
 
05:55:35.948 --> 05:55:35.958 align:start position:0%
the the teaching Academy if you will we
 
05:55:37.910 --> 05:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
get a brand new teacher out of college
 
05:55:40.350 --> 05:55:40.360 align:start position:0%
and we'd spend two years or so three
 
05:55:42.230 --> 05:55:42.240 align:start position:0%
years working with them and mentoring
 
05:55:43.628 --> 05:55:43.638 align:start position:0%
them and then they would leave us for
 
05:55:45.948 --> 05:55:45.958 align:start position:0%
another school district I say this is a
 
05:55:47.708 --> 05:55:47.718 align:start position:0%
cautionary tale because if you start
 
05:55:49.390 --> 05:55:49.400 align:start position:0%
taking fairly large amounts of money out
 
05:55:51.390 --> 05:55:51.400 align:start position:0%
of the school budget to fund these other
 
05:55:53.510 --> 05:55:53.520 align:start position:0%
priorities what's going to happen is
 
05:55:55.990 --> 05:55:56.000 align:start position:0%
you're going to do less no one in the
 
05:55:58.030 --> 05:55:58.040 align:start position:0%
history of the world ever did more with
 
05:56:00.150 --> 05:56:00.160 align:start position:0%
less you're going to do less with less
 
05:56:02.430 --> 05:56:02.440 align:start position:0%
so at our public high schools that less
 
05:56:04.830 --> 05:56:04.840 align:start position:0%
is going to start with things that kids
 
05:56:06.830 --> 05:56:06.840 align:start position:0%
kids like to do that enrich and enhance
 
05:56:09.510 --> 05:56:09.520 align:start position:0%
their their success there like sports
 
05:56:11.510 --> 05:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
like clubs like extracurricular
 
05:56:13.708 --> 05:56:13.718 align:start position:0%
activities and eventually we could get
 
05:56:15.390 --> 05:56:15.400 align:start position:0%
to the point where we're having to get
 
05:56:16.868 --> 05:56:16.878 align:start position:0%
rid of everything that isn't a State
 
05:56:19.548 --> 05:56:19.558 align:start position:0%
graduation requirement at at a school
 
05:56:21.708 --> 05:56:21.718 align:start position:0%
and that's not really very good public
 
05:56:23.750 --> 05:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
education the final thing that I want to
 
05:56:26.510 --> 05:56:26.520 align:start position:0%
just kind of mention as in in and in
 
05:56:28.708 --> 05:56:28.718 align:start position:0%
closing is that there are there's no
 
05:56:30.430 --> 05:56:30.440 align:start position:0%
Financial note attached to this thing
 
05:56:32.590 --> 05:56:32.600 align:start position:0%
right here and when I listened uh to
 
05:56:34.670 --> 05:56:34.680 align:start position:0%
representative verbil talk about this he
 
05:56:36.670 --> 05:56:36.680 align:start position:0%
talked about sending as much as
 
05:56:39.150 --> 05:56:39.160 align:start position:0%
$113,000 of of money out of a school
 
05:56:41.628 --> 05:56:41.638 align:start position:0%
district uh towards this program well if
 
05:56:44.510 --> 05:56:44.520 align:start position:0%
the financial note for for CAD Bill 20
 
05:56:46.868 --> 05:56:46.878 align:start position:0%
which I do not support either if you
 
05:56:49.110 --> 05:56:49.120 align:start position:0%
look at that there's some certain fixed
 
05:56:50.708 --> 05:56:50.718 align:start position:0%
costs that are associated with actually
 
05:56:52.910 --> 05:56:52.920 align:start position:0%
having a school district and they run
 
05:56:54.990 --> 05:56:55.000 align:start position:0%
for some school districts up to
 
05:56:57.310 --> 05:56:57.320 align:start position:0%
$113,000 so it's not going to take very
 
05:57:00.628 --> 05:57:00.638 align:start position:0%
long to put a fairly sub substantial de
 
05:57:03.190 --> 05:57:03.200 align:start position:0%
dent in your school funding if you start
 
05:57:05.030 --> 05:57:05.040 align:start position:0%
taking that kind of money out of it to
 
05:57:06.708 --> 05:57:06.718 align:start position:0%
give it to people that want to send
 
05:57:09.070 --> 05:57:09.080 align:start position:0%
their children to another
 
05:57:13.070 --> 05:57:13.080 align:start position:0%
school and so um in closing I I urge the
 
05:57:15.070 --> 05:57:15.080 align:start position:0%
members of the committee please please
 
05:57:17.708 --> 05:57:17.718 align:start position:0%
please do not Advance this bill out of
 
05:57:20.468 --> 05:57:20.478 align:start position:0%
committee until you see the fiscal note
 
05:57:23.948 --> 05:57:23.958 align:start position:0%

05:57:25.830 --> 05:57:25.840 align:start position:0%

05:57:27.270 --> 05:57:27.280 align:start position:0%

05:57:38.868 --> 05:57:38.878 align:start position:0%
I've promoted you are you prepared to
 
05:57:42.030 --> 05:57:42.040 align:start position:0%
speak yes I
 
05:57:44.270 --> 05:57:44.280 align:start position:0%
amot thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
05:57:46.150 --> 05:57:46.160 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is Scot
 
05:57:48.190 --> 05:57:48.200 align:start position:0%
Ross and I'm a resident of gtown New
 
05:57:51.150 --> 05:57:51.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um I was in the private sector
 
05:57:52.830 --> 05:57:52.840 align:start position:0%
as a manager for an insurance company
 
05:57:54.788 --> 05:57:54.798 align:start position:0%
for almost 30 years and I've been a
 
05:57:57.430 --> 05:57:57.440 align:start position:0%
business administrator for sau9 for the
 
05:57:59.628 --> 05:57:59.638 align:start position:0%
last two and a half years I'm going to
 
05:58:02.350 --> 05:58:02.360 align:start position:0%
focus my comments uh on two areas one as
 
05:58:04.468 --> 05:58:04.478 align:start position:0%
a business administrator and secondly
 
05:58:07.390 --> 05:58:07.400 align:start position:0%
just as a taxpayer um on page three of
 
05:58:09.350 --> 05:58:09.360 align:start position:0%
the bill it talks about the computation
 
05:58:12.788 --> 05:58:12.798 align:start position:0%
of local education funds and um I first
 
05:58:14.110 --> 05:58:14.120 align:start position:0%
want to also want to thank
 
05:58:16.590 --> 05:58:16.600 align:start position:0%
representative reveal for a very good
 
05:58:18.788 --> 05:58:18.798 align:start position:0%
presentation and uh his work on this
 
05:58:20.830 --> 05:58:20.840 align:start position:0%
bill um I will say though that as a
 
05:58:22.468 --> 05:58:22.478 align:start position:0%
business administrator someone who has
 
05:58:24.350 --> 05:58:24.360 align:start position:0%
to actually look at the law and apply
 
05:58:26.708 --> 05:58:26.718 align:start position:0%
the law to formulas I found it very
 
05:58:30.350 --> 05:58:30.360 align:start position:0%
confusing um and when you talk about
 
05:58:33.070 --> 05:58:33.080 align:start position:0%
that would be lines five through 11 on
 
05:58:35.948 --> 05:58:35.958 align:start position:0%
page three I came up with very different
 
05:58:38.750 --> 05:58:38.760 align:start position:0%
numbers when I ran those numbers I um
 
05:58:40.350 --> 05:58:40.360 align:start position:0%
and I would suggest that if you do
 
05:58:41.948 --> 05:58:41.958 align:start position:0%
proceed with this bill that you use
 
05:58:45.948 --> 05:58:45.958 align:start position:0%
common um terms that are used with a Dr
 
05:58:47.390 --> 05:58:47.400 align:start position:0%
so if you're talking about a local
 
05:58:49.868 --> 05:58:49.878 align:start position:0%
education tax effort then please use
 
05:58:51.910 --> 05:58:51.920 align:start position:0%
those words I'm just simply trying to
 
05:58:53.708 --> 05:58:53.718 align:start position:0%
make it easier for those like myself who
 
05:58:57.788 --> 05:58:57.798 align:start position:0%
might have to apply your formulas um
 
05:58:59.910 --> 05:58:59.920 align:start position:0%
wasn't sure also if if Food Service
 
05:59:03.310 --> 05:59:03.320 align:start position:0%
would be subtracted from this um because
 
05:59:05.390 --> 05:59:05.400 align:start position:0%
you talked about uh in the bill it talks
 
05:59:08.310 --> 05:59:08.320 align:start position:0%
about monies raised by taxation I think
 
05:59:10.990 --> 05:59:11.000 align:start position:0%
of a total appropriation which includes
 
05:59:15.150 --> 05:59:15.160 align:start position:0%
General funds uh um Grant funds and also
 
05:59:16.670 --> 05:59:16.680 align:start position:0%
Food Service funds and it was kind of
 
05:59:19.350 --> 05:59:19.360 align:start position:0%
that was absent from it um so again I
 
05:59:21.230 --> 05:59:21.240 align:start position:0%
would ask you just to put more clarity
 
05:59:23.230 --> 05:59:23.240 align:start position:0%
around that one because again your
 
05:59:25.990 --> 05:59:26.000 align:start position:0%
numbers and the numbers that I ran um
 
05:59:28.270 --> 05:59:28.280 align:start position:0%
they were vastly different
 
05:59:30.830 --> 05:59:30.840 align:start position:0%
um so again that was one thing um on
 
05:59:34.350 --> 05:59:34.360 align:start position:0%
page four um on this will be line number
 
05:59:36.708 --> 05:59:36.718 align:start position:0%
28 conduct an annual audit of all
 
05:59:38.990 --> 05:59:39.000 align:start position:0%
accounts of eligible students if you
 
05:59:40.788 --> 05:59:40.798 align:start position:0%
could put more clarity what type of
 
05:59:44.070 --> 05:59:44.080 align:start position:0%
audit is that a financial audit uh if so
 
05:59:46.468 --> 05:59:46.478 align:start position:0%
is it an independent Financial audit and
 
05:59:47.868 --> 05:59:47.878 align:start position:0%
again I know those comments have been
 
05:59:50.468 --> 05:59:50.478 align:start position:0%
made before about anytime we're using
 
05:59:53.110 --> 05:59:53.120 align:start position:0%
any type of taxpayer money um I do
 
05:59:55.310 --> 05:59:55.320 align:start position:0%
believe that there should be independent
 
05:59:57.190 --> 05:59:57.200 align:start position:0%
Financial audits of all entities
 
05:59:57.200 --> 05:59:58.990 align:start position:0%
Financial audits of all entities
involved

05:59:58.990 --> 05:59:59.000 align:start position:0%
involved
 
06:00:02.628 --> 06:00:02.638 align:start position:0%
um as now speaking as a as a taxpayer or
 
06:00:05.430 --> 06:00:05.440 align:start position:0%
just as a a private citizen um I always
 
06:00:08.110 --> 06:00:08.120 align:start position:0%
worry about bills and un unintended
 
06:00:09.548 --> 06:00:09.558 align:start position:0%
consequences and this would be a
 
06:00:13.070 --> 06:00:13.080 align:start position:0%
question for a representative reveal um
 
06:00:15.708 --> 06:00:15.718 align:start position:0%
if hypothetically I was someone who
 
06:00:17.788 --> 06:00:17.798 align:start position:0%
loves sports and I am someone who loves
 
06:00:21.150 --> 06:00:21.160 align:start position:0%
sports um would it be possible for
 
06:00:24.430 --> 06:00:24.440 align:start position:0%
students or for uh schools to recruit
 
06:00:26.788 --> 06:00:26.798 align:start position:0%
say um you know certain basketball
 
06:00:29.030 --> 06:00:29.040 align:start position:0%
players football players Etc to go to
 
06:00:31.510 --> 06:00:31.520 align:start position:0%
another public school or private school
 
06:00:34.310 --> 06:00:34.320 align:start position:0%
and if so could an unint an unintended
 
06:00:36.590 --> 06:00:36.600 align:start position:0%
consequence of this bill mean that there
 
06:00:38.468 --> 06:00:38.478 align:start position:0%
could be recruitment of athletes going
 
06:00:41.190 --> 06:00:41.200 align:start position:0%
to Local Schools meaning that could a
 
06:00:43.990 --> 06:00:44.000 align:start position:0%
town like gtown High School uh could we
 
06:00:45.708 --> 06:00:45.718 align:start position:0%
recruit the best football players in the
 
06:00:48.590 --> 06:00:48.600 align:start position:0%
state and would that U monies from those
 
06:00:51.030 --> 06:00:51.040 align:start position:0%
individual school districts go to us and
 
06:00:53.510 --> 06:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
simply uh for that purpose so I will
 
06:00:55.190 --> 06:00:55.200 align:start position:0%
leave it at that I do believe that this
 
06:00:57.910 --> 06:00:57.920 align:start position:0%
bill although um I think the ptions
 
06:01:00.110 --> 06:01:00.120 align:start position:0%
might be good by um representative rille
 
06:01:02.670 --> 06:01:02.680 align:start position:0%
I just think there's a lot of um issues
 
06:01:05.190 --> 06:01:05.200 align:start position:0%
that arise that I think need a lot of
 
06:01:07.110 --> 06:01:07.120 align:start position:0%
clarity so thank you very much
 
06:01:08.990 --> 06:01:09.000 align:start position:0%
appreciate it thank you very much Scott
 
06:01:10.948 --> 06:01:10.958 align:start position:0%
and appreciate uh your attention and
 
06:01:13.628 --> 06:01:13.638 align:start position:0%
providing us lines and page numbers and
 
06:01:17.468 --> 06:01:17.478 align:start position:0%
issues which uh it points people in a
 
06:01:20.788 --> 06:01:20.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:23.548 --> 06:01:23.558 align:start position:0%
much next speaker next speaker okay next
 
06:01:26.788 --> 06:01:26.798 align:start position:0%

06:01:30.150 --> 06:01:30.160 align:start position:0%
been promoted are you there Esther thank
 
06:01:32.628 --> 06:01:32.638 align:start position:0%
you everyone for taking my testimony
 
06:01:34.868 --> 06:01:34.878 align:start position:0%
today I will be speaking to you on
 
06:01:38.110 --> 06:01:38.120 align:start position:0%
behalf um as an individual but I do
 
06:01:40.070 --> 06:01:40.080 align:start position:0%
represent um the Guilford School
 
06:01:42.430 --> 06:01:42.440 align:start position:0%
District as a student service director
 
06:01:44.948 --> 06:01:44.958 align:start position:0%
and I also have um on Portsmith city
 
06:01:47.430 --> 06:01:47.440 align:start position:0%
council as a city
 
06:01:49.510 --> 06:01:49.520 align:start position:0%
councelor um I come to you with
 
06:01:53.110 --> 06:01:53.120 align:start position:0%
questions about the bill um in listening
 
06:01:56.468 --> 06:01:56.478 align:start position:0%
to the evidence at the beginning of the
 
06:01:59.150 --> 06:01:59.160 align:start position:0%
presentation by Mr or representative
 
06:02:01.708 --> 06:02:01.718 align:start position:0%
rille um he talked about the special ed
 
06:02:03.030 --> 06:02:03.040 align:start position:0%
and as you as you know as a student
 
06:02:05.110 --> 06:02:05.120 align:start position:0%
service director I'm very concerned with
 
06:02:07.390 --> 06:02:07.400 align:start position:0%
that but as a student service director
 
06:02:09.468 --> 06:02:09.478 align:start position:0%
I'm also concerned with many of our
 
06:02:11.948 --> 06:02:11.958 align:start position:0%
children who are on 504 plans and that
 
06:02:14.548 --> 06:02:14.558 align:start position:0%
has not been discussed I'm also
 
06:02:16.788 --> 06:02:16.798 align:start position:0%
concerned with many of our children as a
 
06:02:17.948 --> 06:02:17.958 align:start position:0%
student service director we have
 
06:02:18.990 --> 06:02:19.000 align:start position:0%
students in
 
06:02:22.110 --> 06:02:22.120 align:start position:0%
esol and that has not been
 
06:02:24.390 --> 06:02:24.400 align:start position:0%
discussed I'm also concerned with the
 
06:02:26.350 --> 06:02:26.360 align:start position:0%
fact that you know we talk about
 
06:02:28.590 --> 06:02:28.600 align:start position:0%
students that have stable families that
 
06:02:31.548 --> 06:02:31.558 align:start position:0%
can make decisions about this um and use
 
06:02:33.788 --> 06:02:33.798 align:start position:0%
the funds but who makes the decisions
 
06:02:35.310 --> 06:02:35.320 align:start position:0%
for foster care
 
06:02:37.590 --> 06:02:37.600 align:start position:0%
children when it comes to looking at
 
06:02:40.190 --> 06:02:40.200 align:start position:0%
education for this
 
06:02:42.590 --> 06:02:42.600 align:start position:0%
program what I did not see in the bill I
 
06:02:44.750 --> 06:02:44.760 align:start position:0%
did not see anything that talks about
 
06:02:47.270 --> 06:02:47.280 align:start position:0%
how are we going to evaluate whether
 
06:02:48.910 --> 06:02:48.920 align:start position:0%
their educational experience is
 
06:02:51.110 --> 06:02:51.120 align:start position:0%
successful we talk about finances in
 
06:02:53.708 --> 06:02:53.718 align:start position:0%
this bill but we don't talk about what
 
06:02:55.468 --> 06:02:55.478 align:start position:0%
the outcomes are going to be for
 
06:02:57.750 --> 06:02:57.760 align:start position:0%
students that go to placements that we
 
06:03:01.310 --> 06:03:01.320 align:start position:0%
have no knowledge of and lastly what
 
06:03:04.230 --> 06:03:04.240 align:start position:0%
happens when a student goes and only
 
06:03:07.350 --> 06:03:07.360 align:start position:0%
goes for a couple months or ends up in a
 
06:03:10.468 --> 06:03:10.478 align:start position:0%
situation and because of their behaviors
 
06:03:12.070 --> 06:03:12.080 align:start position:0%
they are kicked out of their situation
 
06:03:14.990 --> 06:03:15.000 align:start position:0%
and go back to the school that will
 
06:03:18.830 --> 06:03:18.840 align:start position:0%
accept all children our Public
 
06:03:21.150 --> 06:03:21.160 align:start position:0%
Schools what happens to the funding how
 
06:03:23.270 --> 06:03:23.280 align:start position:0%
do that work I don't see anything like
 
06:03:26.270 --> 06:03:26.280 align:start position:0%
that in here when we see our Charter
 
06:03:29.310 --> 06:03:29.320 align:start position:0%
Schools many many of our schools um have
 
06:03:30.868 --> 06:03:30.878 align:start position:0%
students that go to Charter Schools or
 
06:03:32.190 --> 06:03:32.200 align:start position:0%
have gone to Charter
 
06:03:34.350 --> 06:03:34.360 align:start position:0%
Schools unfortunately some of our
 
06:03:37.310 --> 06:03:37.320 align:start position:0%
charter schools accept students and then
 
06:03:39.070 --> 06:03:39.080 align:start position:0%
the students don't meet their
 
06:03:41.750 --> 06:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
expectation and quite often it's
 
06:03:43.670 --> 06:03:43.680 align:start position:0%
behaviorally and then they get sent back
 
06:03:46.430 --> 06:03:46.440 align:start position:0%
to the public school so what happens to
 
06:03:49.830 --> 06:03:49.840 align:start position:0%
all that money who takes care of
 
06:03:52.110 --> 06:03:52.120 align:start position:0%
that and I'd like to finish today with
 
06:03:54.510 --> 06:03:54.520 align:start position:0%
talking about that
 
06:03:57.948 --> 06:03:57.958 align:start position:0%
5% I truly believe that that money that
 
06:04:02.350 --> 06:04:02.360 align:start position:0%
our tax pay payers um have raised by
 
06:04:04.708 --> 06:04:04.718 align:start position:0%
their local property funds they have
 
06:04:06.910 --> 06:04:06.920 align:start position:0%
chosen the school they wanted they come
 
06:04:09.150 --> 06:04:09.160 align:start position:0%
and vote they come and pick who they
 
06:04:12.110 --> 06:04:12.120 align:start position:0%
have as administrators and whether
 
06:04:14.350 --> 06:04:14.360 align:start position:0%
you're in gford or in Portsmouth or in
 
06:04:17.070 --> 06:04:17.080 align:start position:0%
other parts of the state people are very
 
06:04:20.230 --> 06:04:20.240 align:start position:0%
active in their Community but one of the
 
06:04:21.548 --> 06:04:21.558 align:start position:0%
things that I saw on the bill is you're
 
06:04:21.558 --> 06:04:22.510 align:start position:0%
things that I saw on the bill is you're
taking

06:04:22.510 --> 06:04:22.520 align:start position:0%
taking
 
06:04:25.910 --> 06:04:25.920 align:start position:0%
5% to take care of these
 
06:04:28.510 --> 06:04:28.520 align:start position:0%
funds is that is that an unfunded
 
06:04:31.910 --> 06:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
mandate I'm just asking thank you for
 
06:04:34.628 --> 06:04:34.638 align:start position:0%
your time I know we're in hard times and
 
06:04:36.030 --> 06:04:36.040 align:start position:0%

06:04:38.310 --> 06:04:38.320 align:start position:0%
for being full in since September and
 
06:04:40.948 --> 06:04:40.958 align:start position:0%
we're doing great jobs with our students
 
06:04:43.548 --> 06:04:43.558 align:start position:0%
so I'm hoping that we can get these
 
06:04:45.750 --> 06:04:45.760 align:start position:0%
questions answered and I'm hoping that
 
06:04:47.750 --> 06:04:47.760 align:start position:0%

planfield

06:05:07.868 --> 06:05:07.878 align:start position:0%
planfield
 
06:05:11.230 --> 06:05:11.240 align:start position:0%
my family saved our town of planfield
 
06:05:15.510 --> 06:05:15.520 align:start position:0%
over 4,00,000 by homeschooling all nine
 
06:05:17.750 --> 06:05:17.760 align:start position:0%
of our children through High School from
 
06:05:19.708 --> 06:05:19.718 align:start position:0%
the time our oldest started High School
 
06:05:21.990 --> 06:05:22.000 align:start position:0%
to the time our youngest graduated the
 
06:05:24.548 --> 06:05:24.558 align:start position:0%
tuition at our area agreement school
 
06:05:26.110 --> 06:05:26.120 align:start position:0%
which was Lebanon High School jumped
 
06:05:29.788 --> 06:05:29.798 align:start position:0%
from 7,000 $300 to
 
06:05:33.070 --> 06:05:33.080 align:start position:0%
15,600 at an average of about $1,000 a
 
06:05:35.510 --> 06:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
year times nine kids times 4 years of
 
06:05:38.190 --> 06:05:38.200 align:start position:0%
high school each our savings to the town
 
06:05:39.868 --> 06:05:39.878 align:start position:0%
took place while we were still paying
 
06:05:43.030 --> 06:05:43.040 align:start position:0%
our entire tax bill with no tax
 
06:05:45.190 --> 06:05:45.200 align:start position:0%
relief while all the while planfield
 
06:05:47.150 --> 06:05:47.160 align:start position:0%
families who sent students to Kimble
 
06:05:49.030 --> 06:05:49.040 align:start position:0%
Union Academy which is a private high
 
06:05:51.190 --> 06:05:51.200 align:start position:0%
school here in planfield received a
 
06:05:53.868 --> 06:05:53.878 align:start position:0%
planfield exemption in their tuition to
 
06:05:56.788 --> 06:05:56.798 align:start position:0%
KOA for decades our town has been voting
 
06:05:58.830 --> 06:05:58.840 align:start position:0%
at town meeting for a taxx exemption to
 
06:06:03.990 --> 06:06:04.000 align:start position:0%
KOA pursuant to RSA 72 col 23 KOA in
 
06:06:06.510 --> 06:06:06.520 align:start position:0%
turn has given tuition credits to play
 
06:06:09.270 --> 06:06:09.280 align:start position:0%
field students who opt to attend there
 
06:06:10.468 --> 06:06:10.478 align:start position:0%
the amount depends on the number of
 
06:06:12.390 --> 06:06:12.400 align:start position:0%
students attending every given year and
 
06:06:14.270 --> 06:06:14.280 align:start position:0%
the way the amount is determined has
 
06:06:16.948 --> 06:06:16.958 align:start position:0%
been modified and refined over the years
 
06:06:19.350 --> 06:06:19.360 align:start position:0%
it's varied from a blanket $1,800 a
 
06:06:22.310 --> 06:06:22.320 align:start position:0%
student in 1993 for example to a range
 
06:06:26.990 --> 06:06:27.000 align:start position:0%
of $1,300 to $9,000 in 2007 when it was
 
06:06:30.150 --> 06:06:30.160 align:start position:0%
more needs based the main purpose of the
 
06:06:31.910 --> 06:06:31.920 align:start position:0%
grant was to encourage planfield
 
06:06:34.990 --> 06:06:35.000 align:start position:0%
students to choose Kua and save the town
 
06:06:37.708 --> 06:06:37.718 align:start position:0%
the tuition to Lebanon High School
 
06:06:39.628 --> 06:06:39.638 align:start position:0%
here's what the planfield Kua study
 
06:06:42.350 --> 06:06:42.360 align:start position:0%
committee wrote in 1997 about this
 
06:06:44.910 --> 06:06:44.920 align:start position:0%
option considering the long history of
 
06:06:46.750 --> 06:06:46.760 align:start position:0%
the use of this tax exemption by
 
06:06:48.830 --> 06:06:48.840 align:start position:0%
students in this town and the large
 
06:06:51.310 --> 06:06:51.320 align:start position:0%
number who have benefited from it this
 
06:06:52.868 --> 06:06:52.878 align:start position:0%
committee would like to ask the school
 
06:06:55.190 --> 06:06:55.200 align:start position:0%
board the Selectmen and the conquered
 
06:06:57.868 --> 06:06:57.878 align:start position:0%
delegation to seek ways to expand such
 
06:06:59.868 --> 06:06:59.878 align:start position:0%
educational options for students
 
06:07:02.708 --> 06:07:02.718 align:start position:0%
choosing other alternative education
 
06:07:05.468 --> 06:07:05.478 align:start position:0%
that was two decades ago the local
 
06:07:07.430 --> 06:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
education savings account described in
 
06:07:09.670 --> 06:07:09.680 align:start position:0%
this bill is one of the options we've
 
06:07:12.190 --> 06:07:12.200 align:start position:0%
been looking for here in planfield since
 
06:07:15.110 --> 06:07:15.120 align:start position:0%
1997 it could serve well in towns that
 
06:07:17.390 --> 06:07:17.400 align:start position:0%
do not have a high school by offering an
 
06:07:19.190 --> 06:07:19.200 align:start position:0%
incentive to families to try other
 
06:07:21.390 --> 06:07:21.400 align:start position:0%
educational Alternatives thus saving
 
06:07:24.468 --> 06:07:24.478 align:start position:0%
tuition costs for the town our family's
 
06:07:26.390 --> 06:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
story is proof that Family Choice
 
06:07:26.400 --> 06:07:27.430 align:start position:0%
story is proof that Family Choice
choices

06:07:27.430 --> 06:07:27.440 align:start position:0%
choices
 
06:07:29.868 --> 06:07:29.878 align:start position:0%
can be a financial benefit to a town
 
06:07:31.510 --> 06:07:31.520 align:start position:0%
Although our choice was made without the
 
06:07:34.030 --> 06:07:34.040 align:start position:0%
help of an educational savings account
 
06:07:35.590 --> 06:07:35.600 align:start position:0%
think how much more benefit there could
 
06:07:38.830 --> 06:07:38.840 align:start position:0%
be to individual towns if they had a a
 
06:07:41.150 --> 06:07:41.160 align:start position:0%
tool like this and were allowed to make
 
06:07:43.270 --> 06:07:43.280 align:start position:0%
decisions to encourage these
 
06:07:45.310 --> 06:07:45.320 align:start position:0%
opportunities please vote this bill
 
06:07:47.590 --> 06:07:47.600 align:start position:0%
ought to pass my written testimony has
 
06:07:49.708 --> 06:07:49.718 align:start position:0%
been submitted thank

and Bob's Rob Spencer could not find
 
06:08:14.948 --> 06:08:14.958 align:start position:0%
them so uh I looked on to Mary wilky and

she has been
 
06:08:20.310 --> 06:08:20.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:25.788 --> 06:08:25.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:25.798 --> 06:08:28.230 align:start position:0%
 
unmute

06:08:28.230 --> 06:08:28.240 align:start position:0%

okay can you can you hear me thank you
 
06:08:31.910 --> 06:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and members of the
 
06:08:33.750 --> 06:08:33.760 align:start position:0%
committee um I'm Mary wilky I'm a
 
06:08:35.670 --> 06:08:35.680 align:start position:0%
retired teacher and a taxpayer from
 
06:08:38.070 --> 06:08:38.080 align:start position:0%
conquered and I'm speaking in opposition
 
06:08:42.750 --> 06:08:42.760 align:start position:0%
to this bill um under HB 607 a student
 
06:08:44.830 --> 06:08:44.840 align:start position:0%
from conquer taking an Esa would be
 
06:08:47.030 --> 06:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
entitled to more than $8,000 a year from
 
06:08:49.390 --> 06:08:49.400 align:start position:0%
our local school budget and as I
 
06:08:51.190 --> 06:08:51.200 align:start position:0%
understand it another approximately
 
06:08:54.868 --> 06:08:54.878 align:start position:0%
$4,000 in adequacy money um so a family
 
06:08:57.150 --> 06:08:57.160 align:start position:0%
with three children could be getting
 
06:09:01.070 --> 06:09:01.080 align:start position:0%
$36,000 a year um to be used for home or
 
06:09:04.030 --> 06:09:04.040 align:start position:0%
private schools um that provide no
 
06:09:07.070 --> 06:09:07.080 align:start position:0%
public oversight as to their quality
 
06:09:09.948 --> 06:09:09.958 align:start position:0%
this is money paid by taxpayers like me
 
06:09:12.868 --> 06:09:12.878 align:start position:0%
and I would expect to have some reliable
 
06:09:15.390 --> 06:09:15.400 align:start position:0%
and objective way to measure whether the
 
06:09:17.030 --> 06:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
money is being used
 
06:09:19.070 --> 06:09:19.080 align:start position:0%
effectively supporters say that we
 
06:09:20.750 --> 06:09:20.760 align:start position:0%
should trust the parents that they're
 
06:09:22.750 --> 06:09:22.760 align:start position:0%
the best people to assess whether their
 
06:09:25.150 --> 06:09:25.160 align:start position:0%
children are making appropriate progress
 
06:09:26.390 --> 06:09:26.400 align:start position:0%
and if something isn't right they'll
 
06:09:28.230 --> 06:09:28.240 align:start position:0%
take them money and goes elsewhere
 
06:09:30.350 --> 06:09:30.360 align:start position:0%
that's a lot of money to just go on
 
06:09:32.548 --> 06:09:32.558 align:start position:0%
trust I once taught a fifth grade
 
06:09:33.948 --> 06:09:33.958 align:start position:0%
student who had been homeschooled up
 
06:09:36.628 --> 06:09:36.638 align:start position:0%
until then she couldn't add and subtract
 
06:09:38.590 --> 06:09:38.600 align:start position:0%
whole numbers and she was reading at a
 
06:09:40.548 --> 06:09:40.558 align:start position:0%
first grade level she did not have a
 
06:09:42.830 --> 06:09:42.840 align:start position:0%
learning disability she simply had not
 
06:09:44.948 --> 06:09:44.958 align:start position:0%
been taught if her parents had been the
 
06:09:46.548 --> 06:09:46.558 align:start position:0%
best judge of her progress they would
 
06:09:48.390 --> 06:09:48.400 align:start position:0%
have changed course long before fifth
 
06:09:50.788 --> 06:09:50.798 align:start position:0%
grade now I know there are excellent H
 
06:09:52.190 --> 06:09:52.200 align:start position:0%
schools and I really don't mean this as
 
06:09:53.910 --> 06:09:53.920 align:start position:0%
an attack on home schools because I know
 
06:09:57.350 --> 06:09:57.360 align:start position:0%
people who do a really good job but um
 
06:09:59.430 --> 06:09:59.440 align:start position:0%
and I imagine people might say that my
 
06:10:02.270 --> 06:10:02.280 align:start position:0%
example is a fluke but how do we know
 
06:10:04.430 --> 06:10:04.440 align:start position:0%
there's no objective data collected
 
06:10:07.070 --> 06:10:07.080 align:start position:0%
about how uh collected by the state
 
06:10:08.830 --> 06:10:08.840 align:start position:0%
about the performance of homeschooled or
 
06:10:11.670 --> 06:10:11.680 align:start position:0%
privately educated children a parent
 
06:10:13.708 --> 06:10:13.718 align:start position:0%
satisfaction survey conducted by the
 
06:10:15.270 --> 06:10:15.280 align:start position:0%
organization that hands out the
 
06:10:17.230 --> 06:10:17.240 align:start position:0%
scholarships is not
 
06:10:19.830 --> 06:10:19.840 align:start position:0%
enough I know that sometimes children in
 
06:10:22.390 --> 06:10:22.400 align:start position:0%
public school fail too but there are
 
06:10:23.990 --> 06:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
accountability measures in place
 
06:10:25.830 --> 06:10:25.840 align:start position:0%
including Statewide assessment results
 
06:10:27.510 --> 06:10:27.520 align:start position:0%
that are collected and publicly
 
06:10:30.030 --> 06:10:30.040 align:start position:0%
disclosed taxpayers with concerns about
 
06:10:31.830 --> 06:10:31.840 align:start position:0%
the quality of their Public Schools can
 
06:10:34.868 --> 06:10:34.878 align:start position:0%
weigh in and push for change via their
 
06:10:37.270 --> 06:10:37.280 align:start position:0%
elected school boards if our money is
 
06:10:39.030 --> 06:10:39.040 align:start position:0%
going to be used to send students to
 
06:10:41.110 --> 06:10:41.120 align:start position:0%
home schools or private schools then
 
06:10:43.030 --> 06:10:43.040 align:start position:0%
those same accountable accountability
 
06:10:45.150 --> 06:10:45.160 align:start position:0%
measures should apply to them and those
 
06:10:46.948 --> 06:10:46.958 align:start position:0%
who are providing excellent education
 
06:10:48.590 --> 06:10:48.600 align:start position:0%
shouldn't B with
 
06:10:51.110 --> 06:10:51.120 align:start position:0%
this and just one other issue that came
 
06:10:53.910 --> 06:10:53.920 align:start position:0%
up earlier when um one of the
 
06:10:55.190 --> 06:10:55.200 align:start position:0%
representatives asked about
 
06:10:57.670 --> 06:10:57.680 align:start position:0%
discrimination issues and I believe that
 
06:10:59.510 --> 06:10:59.520 align:start position:0%
representative verville um kind of
 
06:11:01.948 --> 06:11:01.958 align:start position:0%
focused on the child in that situation
 
06:11:03.548 --> 06:11:03.558 align:start position:0%
and was saying well children will be
 
06:11:05.548 --> 06:11:05.558 align:start position:0%
able to find what what suits them and
 
06:11:07.430 --> 06:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
what what works for them but I'm looking
 
06:11:09.468 --> 06:11:09.478 align:start position:0%
at it from my point of view as a
 
06:11:13.788 --> 06:11:13.798 align:start position:0%
taxpayer um if I understand that private
 
06:11:16.030 --> 06:11:16.040 align:start position:0%
religious schools are allowed by law to
 
06:11:17.868 --> 06:11:17.878 align:start position:0%
discriminate based on disability or the
 
06:11:20.270 --> 06:11:20.280 align:start position:0%
other way to say that is the laws
 
06:11:22.230 --> 06:11:22.240 align:start position:0%
preventing discrimination based on
 
06:11:23.750 --> 06:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
disability don't apply to private
 
06:11:25.868 --> 06:11:25.878 align:start position:0%
religious schools they can also
 
06:11:27.430 --> 06:11:27.440 align:start position:0%
discriminate against students who are
 
06:11:29.670 --> 06:11:29.680 align:start position:0%
gay so if I had a child with a
 
06:11:32.590 --> 06:11:32.600 align:start position:0%
disability or a child who was gay my tax
 
06:11:34.788 --> 06:11:34.798 align:start position:0%
dollars would be subsidizing a school
 
06:11:37.230 --> 06:11:37.240 align:start position:0%
that my child would not be welcome in
 
06:11:39.390 --> 06:11:39.400 align:start position:0%
and I find that um very troubling as
 
06:11:41.708 --> 06:11:41.718 align:start position:0%
well thank you very much for your
 
06:11:45.150 --> 06:11:45.160 align:start position:0%
time thank you very much Mary appreciate
 
06:11:48.628 --> 06:11:48.638 align:start position:0%

06:11:52.830 --> 06:11:52.840 align:start position:0%

06:11:57.350 --> 06:11:57.360 align:start position:0%

06:11:59.830 --> 06:11:59.840 align:start position:0%
chairman lad members of the education
 
06:12:03.190 --> 06:12:03.200 align:start position:0%
committee thank you for your time today
 
06:12:07.590 --> 06:12:07.600 align:start position:0%
I'll be brief um I wanted to register my
 
06:12:09.990 --> 06:12:10.000 align:start position:0%
opposition to this bill I appreciate
 
06:12:12.750 --> 06:12:12.760 align:start position:0%
representative verville's presentation
 
06:12:14.868 --> 06:12:14.878 align:start position:0%
and the time he put into it although I
 
06:12:17.110 --> 06:12:17.120 align:start position:0%
do have to respectfully disagree with
 
06:12:20.310 --> 06:12:20.320 align:start position:0%
some of the points that he made um as
 
06:12:22.750 --> 06:12:22.760 align:start position:0%
you may remember um when I identified
 
06:12:25.190 --> 06:12:25.200 align:start position:0%
myself last week on
 
06:12:29.670 --> 06:12:29.680 align:start position:0%
hb20 and a I'm a former uh School Board
 
06:12:31.548 --> 06:12:31.558 align:start position:0%
member in Pembroke and I'm currently on
 
06:12:34.150 --> 06:12:34.160 align:start position:0%
the budget committee I'm not speaking
 
06:12:35.750 --> 06:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
for either group today I'm just
 
06:12:40.510 --> 06:12:40.520 align:start position:0%
representing myself but um during my
 
06:12:43.350 --> 06:12:43.360 align:start position:0%
service on those committees I found how
 
06:12:46.548 --> 06:12:46.558 align:start position:0%
difficult it is to keep Public Schools
 
06:12:49.310 --> 06:12:49.320 align:start position:0%
solvent um in the circumstances we're in
 
06:12:51.708 --> 06:12:51.718 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire where public schools are
 
06:12:51.718 --> 06:12:53.070 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire where public schools are
woefully

06:12:53.070 --> 06:12:53.080 align:start position:0%
woefully
 
06:12:57.150 --> 06:12:57.160 align:start position:0%
underfunded so I'm probably going to
 
06:12:59.910 --> 06:12:59.920 align:start position:0%
oppose anything that is going to
 
06:13:02.590 --> 06:13:02.600 align:start position:0%
further uh reduce funding for those
 
06:13:02.600 --> 06:13:03.390 align:start position:0%
further uh reduce funding for those
Public

06:13:03.390 --> 06:13:03.400 align:start position:0%
Public
 
06:13:07.708 --> 06:13:07.718 align:start position:0%
Schools particularly um bills that take
 
06:13:10.510 --> 06:13:10.520 align:start position:0%
public money and give them to students
 
06:13:12.708 --> 06:13:12.718 align:start position:0%
to use in private schools are for other
 
06:13:12.718 --> 06:13:14.310 align:start position:0%
to use in private schools are for other
educational

06:13:14.310 --> 06:13:14.320 align:start position:0%
educational
 
06:13:17.350 --> 06:13:17.360 align:start position:0%
purposes um I have problems as been
 
06:13:19.548 --> 06:13:19.558 align:start position:0%
stated by many other speakers with the
 
06:13:21.868 --> 06:13:21.878 align:start position:0%
accountability issue the discriminate
 
06:13:25.390 --> 06:13:25.400 align:start position:0%
the Discrimination issue um but my real
 
06:13:29.350 --> 06:13:29.360 align:start position:0%
concern is to funding issue and um I I'd
 
06:13:31.110 --> 06:13:31.120 align:start position:0%
just like to encourage them the
 
06:13:35.190 --> 06:13:35.200 align:start position:0%
committee to uh uh to to look at bills
 
06:13:38.670 --> 06:13:38.680 align:start position:0%
that might uh help the underfunded

have to say about this so I just
 
06:14:01.548 --> 06:14:01.558 align:start position:0%

representative and representative moff
 
06:14:07.548 --> 06:14:07.558 align:start position:0%
would like to ask you a question if
 
06:14:09.468 --> 06:14:09.478 align:start position:0%
that's okay
 
06:14:14.230 --> 06:14:14.240 align:start position:0%
sure yeah hey uh honorable uh Dave dhy U
 
06:14:16.910 --> 06:14:16.920 align:start position:0%
you mentioned discrim discrimination and
 
06:14:18.628 --> 06:14:18.638 align:start position:0%
several others today have mentioned
 
06:14:21.070 --> 06:14:21.080 align:start position:0%
discrimination schools that
 
06:14:24.350 --> 06:14:24.360 align:start position:0%
discriminate um in there's a couple of
 
06:14:26.430 --> 06:14:26.440 align:start position:0%
all girl schools there's one in the Anon
 
06:14:29.548 --> 06:14:29.558 align:start position:0%
there's one up in Jefferson uh do you
 
06:14:31.628 --> 06:14:31.638 align:start position:0%
think these are discriminatory
 
06:14:33.990 --> 06:14:34.000 align:start position:0%
schools I'm I'm not familiar with those
 
06:14:34.000 --> 06:14:35.190 align:start position:0%
schools I'm I'm not familiar with those
schools

06:14:35.190 --> 06:14:35.200 align:start position:0%
schools
 
06:14:37.830 --> 06:14:37.840 align:start position:0%
representative uh so I I guess I I can't
 
06:14:39.830 --> 06:14:39.840 align:start position:0%
comment on them but I do know that that
 
06:14:42.390 --> 06:14:42.400 align:start position:0%
there are many private schools that have
 
06:14:44.830 --> 06:14:44.840 align:start position:0%
qualifications for students um I
 
06:14:46.830 --> 06:14:46.840 align:start position:0%
actually have worked in private schools
 
06:14:50.708 --> 06:14:50.718 align:start position:0%
in the past and I know that U they don't
 
06:14:54.628 --> 06:14:54.638 align:start position:0%
take uh any student that applies um for
 
06:14:57.910 --> 06:14:57.920 align:start position:0%
any number of different reasons and I
 
06:15:01.510 --> 06:15:01.520 align:start position:0%
find that um that's fine that's that's
 
06:15:04.548 --> 06:15:04.558 align:start position:0%
within their right to do that but um
 
06:15:07.230 --> 06:15:07.240 align:start position:0%
public schools have to accept um all
 
06:15:09.788 --> 06:15:09.798 align:start position:0%
students and educate all students and I
 
06:15:12.830 --> 06:15:12.840 align:start position:0%
think that that's a a real distinction
 
06:15:15.110 --> 06:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
uh that we have to look at carefully so
 
06:15:17.030 --> 06:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm not sure if I answered your
 
06:15:19.390 --> 06:15:19.400 align:start position:0%
question uh but thank you for thank you
 
06:15:20.590 --> 06:15:20.600 align:start position:0%
for asking
 
06:15:24.350 --> 06:15:24.360 align:start position:0%
it yes thank you for your answer I my my
 
06:15:26.788 --> 06:15:26.798 align:start position:0%
sense is from hearing uh you've
 
06:15:28.948 --> 06:15:28.958 align:start position:0%
mentioned discrimination and others have
 
06:15:32.548 --> 06:15:32.558 align:start position:0%
mentioned that my sense is it's a
 
06:15:36.270 --> 06:15:36.280 align:start position:0%
pejorative and uh and that's just my
 
06:15:38.948 --> 06:15:38.958 align:start position:0%
concern here is that if someone wanted
 
06:15:41.350 --> 06:15:41.360 align:start position:0%
the the girl school in anim is very
 
06:15:44.708 --> 06:15:44.718 align:start position:0%
small for special needs girls and if
 
06:15:46.390 --> 06:15:46.400 align:start position:0%
that's a school that's the best school
 
06:15:50.150 --> 06:15:50.160 align:start position:0%
for a young girl uh the notion that it's
 
06:15:52.030 --> 06:15:52.040 align:start position:0%
discriminatory because it doesn't take
 
06:15:55.070 --> 06:15:55.080 align:start position:0%
boys uh that's that's that was my
 
06:15:56.628 --> 06:15:56.638 align:start position:0%
question for you and and for others
 
06:15:58.230 --> 06:15:58.240 align:start position:0%
because you're not the first one that's
 
06:16:00.350 --> 06:16:00.360 align:start position:0%
brought that up uh so thank you for your
 
06:16:01.310 --> 06:16:01.320 align:start position:0%
for your
 
06:16:04.230 --> 06:16:04.240 align:start position:0%

Hampshire school boards Association we
 
06:17:07.310 --> 06:17:07.320 align:start position:0%
are opposed to House Bill
 
06:17:10.990 --> 06:17:11.000 align:start position:0%
607 uh I'd like to comment um or respond
 
06:17:13.030 --> 06:17:13.040 align:start position:0%
to a couple of comments um that were
 
06:17:15.670 --> 06:17:15.680 align:start position:0%
made by by previous speakers um
 
06:17:17.430 --> 06:17:17.440 align:start position:0%
representative vervo you stated that
 
06:17:19.430 --> 06:17:19.440 align:start position:0%
there are no public schools in New
 
06:17:21.750 --> 06:17:21.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um the New Hampshire Supreme
 
06:17:23.830 --> 06:17:23.840 align:start position:0%
Court has said otherwise um The
 
06:17:26.150 --> 06:17:26.160 align:start position:0%
Claremont decision is pretty clear about
 
06:17:28.788 --> 06:17:28.798 align:start position:0%
what the obligations of the state are to
 
06:17:32.468 --> 06:17:32.478 align:start position:0%
fund a public education to include um
 
06:17:34.390 --> 06:17:34.400 align:start position:0%
accountability measures within public
 
06:17:38.310 --> 06:17:38.320 align:start position:0%
education so on and so forth um you know
 
06:17:41.030 --> 06:17:41.040 align:start position:0%
I I as reading through the bill it it
 
06:17:43.190 --> 06:17:43.200 align:start position:0%
dawned on me it's not a direct analogy
 
06:17:45.150 --> 06:17:45.160 align:start position:0%
but it's somewhat similar we had
 
06:17:46.430 --> 06:17:46.440 align:start position:0%
something similar to this when the
 
06:17:49.468 --> 06:17:49.478 align:start position:0%
charter school bill was first enacted um
 
06:17:53.190 --> 06:17:53.200 align:start position:0%
I believe in in the mid90s RS RSA
 
06:17:56.430 --> 06:17:56.440 align:start position:0%
194b uh that bill contained a actually
 
06:17:58.070 --> 06:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
that law does contain a provision
 
06:18:02.468 --> 06:18:02.478 align:start position:0%
whereby local voters through the warrant
 
06:18:05.070 --> 06:18:05.080 align:start position:0%
uh process and warrant article process
 
06:18:07.430 --> 06:18:07.440 align:start position:0%
can adopt and Implement a charter school
 
06:18:10.670 --> 06:18:10.680 align:start position:0%
within an existing public school um
 
06:18:13.230 --> 06:18:13.240 align:start position:0%
voters after that bill was adopted
 
06:18:15.590 --> 06:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
voters you know ran the numbers looked
 
06:18:17.750 --> 06:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
at the process looked at the programs
 
06:18:18.868 --> 06:18:18.878 align:start position:0%
and realized they were going to be
 
06:18:21.788 --> 06:18:21.798 align:start position:0%
paying for the same system twice that
 
06:18:24.150 --> 06:18:24.160 align:start position:0%
was why local voters to my knowledge
 
06:18:25.910 --> 06:18:25.920 align:start position:0%
have not approved any Charter School
 
06:18:28.190 --> 06:18:28.200 align:start position:0%
schools um across the state I know we
 
06:18:29.708 --> 06:18:29.718 align:start position:0%
have a couple of the one in Dairy next
 
06:18:31.230 --> 06:18:31.240 align:start position:0%
charter schools within I believe the
 
06:18:33.150 --> 06:18:33.160 align:start position:0%
dairy one of the buildings I don't know
 
06:18:35.030 --> 06:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
how that was approved though but we've
 
06:18:37.390 --> 06:18:37.400 align:start position:0%
been through this before um voters
 
06:18:38.910 --> 06:18:38.920 align:start position:0%
looked at it they ran the numbers and
 
06:18:40.350 --> 06:18:40.360 align:start position:0%
they realized that they were going to be
 
06:18:43.110 --> 06:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
funding the same system twice so I look
 
06:18:44.590 --> 06:18:44.600 align:start position:0%
through this bill and I'm thinking to
 
06:18:47.390 --> 06:18:47.400 align:start position:0%
myself we're going to be giving
 
06:18:50.590 --> 06:18:50.600 align:start position:0%
$133,000 for students to actually leave
 
06:18:54.030 --> 06:18:54.040 align:start position:0%
the public school to fund another option
 
06:18:55.350 --> 06:18:55.360 align:start position:0%
whether or not that's homeschooling
 
06:18:56.830 --> 06:18:56.840 align:start position:0%
whether not that attending the private
 
06:18:59.708 --> 06:18:59.718 align:start position:0%
school um it doesn't make good fiscal
 
06:19:02.110 --> 06:19:02.120 align:start position:0%
sense it doesn't make good policy sense
 
06:19:04.708 --> 06:19:04.718 align:start position:0%
and we've tried it once before um with
 
06:19:06.468 --> 06:19:06.478 align:start position:0%
the charter school with the when when
 
06:19:07.788 --> 06:19:07.798 align:start position:0%
Charter Schools were first being
 
06:19:11.910 --> 06:19:11.920 align:start position:0%
implemented in in New Hampshire um and
 
06:19:13.628 --> 06:19:13.638 align:start position:0%
the last comment that I would like to
 
06:19:16.310 --> 06:19:16.320 align:start position:0%
make um to representative Moffet you
 
06:19:18.868 --> 06:19:18.878 align:start position:0%
mentioned that it's a a pejorative um
 
06:19:21.350 --> 06:19:21.360 align:start position:0%
when um opponents of these voucher bills
 
06:19:23.788 --> 06:19:23.798 align:start position:0%
use the dis discrimination aspect that
 
06:19:26.390 --> 06:19:26.400 align:start position:0%
that private schools are allowed to that
 
06:19:27.670 --> 06:19:27.680 align:start position:0%
the private schools are allowed to
 
06:19:30.310 --> 06:19:30.320 align:start position:0%
discriminate and you said that's a Prive
 
06:19:33.070 --> 06:19:33.080 align:start position:0%
um the other Prive that is common
 
06:19:36.310 --> 06:19:36.320 align:start position:0%
through all of these voucher bills um
 
06:19:37.628 --> 06:19:37.638 align:start position:0%
and all of these bills seeking to
 
06:19:39.468 --> 06:19:39.478 align:start position:0%
privatize public education is that the
 
06:19:41.830 --> 06:19:41.840 align:start position:0%
money should follow the child the money
 
06:19:43.548 --> 06:19:43.558 align:start position:0%
does follow the child through the
 
06:19:45.150 --> 06:19:45.160 align:start position:0%
funding system that we have in New
 
06:19:46.868 --> 06:19:46.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it's called the Statewide
 
06:19:49.270 --> 06:19:49.280 align:start position:0%
educational property tax if you live in
 
06:19:51.830 --> 06:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
Deerfield you pay the swept and that's
 
06:19:54.350 --> 06:19:54.360 align:start position:0%
going to fund the deer for school system
 
06:19:56.430 --> 06:19:56.440 align:start position:0%
if that family has three children and
 
06:19:58.788 --> 06:19:58.798 align:start position:0%
they up and move from Deerfield and move
 
06:20:01.190 --> 06:20:01.200 align:start position:0%
to hook set guess what they're paying
 
06:20:03.190 --> 06:20:03.200 align:start position:0%
their swept when they move to hookset
 
06:20:04.788 --> 06:20:04.798 align:start position:0%
that's the money that we use that's the
 
06:20:06.788 --> 06:20:06.798 align:start position:0%
funding system that the legislature has
 
06:20:09.990 --> 06:20:10.000 align:start position:0%
chosen um to use to fund our public
 
06:20:11.948 --> 06:20:11.958 align:start position:0%
schools to meet its Claremont obligation
 
06:20:15.468 --> 06:20:15.478 align:start position:0%
of funding public schools which do exist
 
06:20:15.478 --> 06:20:16.548 align:start position:0%
of funding public schools which do exist
um

06:20:16.548 --> 06:20:16.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:20:20.310 --> 06:20:20.320 align:start position:0%
so those are my comments on the bill um
 
06:20:22.390 --> 06:20:22.400 align:start position:0%
I it it it's a bad policy there's no
 
06:20:24.548 --> 06:20:24.558 align:start position:0%
fiscal note I why we can't get fiscal
 
06:20:26.110 --> 06:20:26.120 align:start position:0%
notes on these bills before they coming
 
06:20:29.190 --> 06:20:29.200 align:start position:0%
to hearing is significantly frustrating
 
06:20:32.350 --> 06:20:32.360 align:start position:0%
um especially in times when um taxpayers
 
06:20:34.708 --> 06:20:34.718 align:start position:0%
are crying for property tax relief
 
06:20:36.990 --> 06:20:37.000 align:start position:0%
especially at a time when um our schools
 
06:20:40.510 --> 06:20:40.520 align:start position:0%
are in flux due to covid so uh nhba is
 
06:20:42.830 --> 06:20:42.840 align:start position:0%
opposed uh to to House Bill
 
06:20:45.430 --> 06:20:45.440 align:start position:0%
607 um those are just a couple of the
 
06:20:48.590 --> 06:20:48.600 align:start position:0%
reasons that nsba opposes this bill um
 
06:20:50.110 --> 06:20:50.120 align:start position:0%
but with that I'm happy to answer any
 
06:20:51.670 --> 06:20:51.680 align:start position:0%
questions that the committee may have
 
06:20:52.830 --> 06:20:52.840 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there any
 
06:20:54.708 --> 06:20:54.718 align:start position:0%
questions for the school boards
 
06:20:54.718 --> 06:20:58.270 align:start position:0%
questions for the school boards
Association

06:21:00.548 --> 06:21:00.558 align:start position:0%
I don't see any hands thank you very
 
06:21:00.558 --> 06:21:02.430 align:start position:0%
I don't see any hands thank you very
much

school
 
06:21:16.070 --> 06:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
region You' been you've been
 
06:21:19.990 --> 06:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
promoted hi yes thank you um thank you
 
06:21:21.910 --> 06:21:21.920 align:start position:0%
uh representative chair lad for the
 
06:21:24.230 --> 06:21:24.240 align:start position:0%
opportunity to address the committee uh
 
06:21:25.750 --> 06:21:25.760 align:start position:0%
my name is Lisa wit I'm the
 
06:21:27.510 --> 06:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
superintendent of schools in the manad
 
06:21:29.788 --> 06:21:29.798 align:start position:0%
Regional School District um I did want
 
06:21:32.910 --> 06:21:32.920 align:start position:0%
to Echo um one of uh baric Christina's
 
06:21:35.868 --> 06:21:35.878 align:start position:0%
comments and also the um the ba from
 
06:21:40.030 --> 06:21:40.040 align:start position:0%
gtown um regarding the calculations um I
 
06:21:42.468 --> 06:21:42.478 align:start position:0%
ran my own calculations and they also
 
06:21:45.310 --> 06:21:45.320 align:start position:0%
seemed not comparable to what
 
06:21:48.590 --> 06:21:48.600 align:start position:0%
representative Ville um had listed so at
 
06:21:50.468 --> 06:21:50.478 align:start position:0%
the very least the the mechanism
 
06:21:52.628 --> 06:21:52.638 align:start position:0%
described in the bill is is confusing
 
06:21:54.990 --> 06:21:55.000 align:start position:0%
and I share the frustration with not
 
06:21:57.708 --> 06:21:57.718 align:start position:0%
having a note to analyze prior to coming
 
06:21:57.718 --> 06:21:58.788 align:start position:0%
having a note to analyze prior to coming
to

06:21:58.788 --> 06:21:58.798 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:22:01.430 --> 06:22:01.440 align:start position:0%
hearing um representative veral also
 
06:22:03.310 --> 06:22:03.320 align:start position:0%
mentioned when he introduced the bill
 
06:22:05.150 --> 06:22:05.160 align:start position:0%
that um a student wouldn't be included
 
06:22:08.868 --> 06:22:08.878 align:start position:0%
in the ADM so the adequacy it could be
 
06:22:11.190 --> 06:22:11.200 align:start position:0%
diverted to the educational savings
 
06:22:13.350 --> 06:22:13.360 align:start position:0%
account but I didn't see a provision in
 
06:22:15.350 --> 06:22:15.360 align:start position:0%
the bill that actually requires a
 
06:22:16.910 --> 06:22:16.920 align:start position:0%
student to withdraw from the public
 
06:22:18.868 --> 06:22:18.878 align:start position:0%
school system to actually access the
 
06:22:21.708 --> 06:22:21.718 align:start position:0%
fund so a student could still be
 
06:22:24.390 --> 06:22:24.400 align:start position:0%
enrolled in the public school system and
 
06:22:26.468 --> 06:22:26.478 align:start position:0%
accessing the public school resources
 
06:22:29.708 --> 06:22:29.718 align:start position:0%
while at the same time using funds for
 
06:22:31.590 --> 06:22:31.600 align:start position:0%
other Educational Services which we
 
06:22:34.468 --> 06:22:34.478 align:start position:0%
heard could be tuition could be online
 
06:22:37.110 --> 06:22:37.120 align:start position:0%
could be Transportation could be
 
06:22:39.350 --> 06:22:39.360 align:start position:0%
tutoring um a district would still be
 
06:22:41.190 --> 06:22:41.200 align:start position:0%
required to provide services for the
 
06:22:44.270 --> 06:22:44.280 align:start position:0%
enrolled student so for each student who
 
06:22:46.510 --> 06:22:46.520 align:start position:0%
remains in the public school for whom
 
06:22:48.070 --> 06:22:48.080 align:start position:0%
there is a voucher account that is being
 
06:22:50.910 --> 06:22:50.920 align:start position:0%
accessed the funds raised by public
 
06:22:53.990 --> 06:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
taxation are on top of that which the
 
06:22:55.548 --> 06:22:55.558 align:start position:0%
district would already be raising to
 
06:22:57.430 --> 06:22:57.440 align:start position:0%
educate that student which I think
 
06:22:59.030 --> 06:22:59.040 align:start position:0%
Barrett also highlighted in his
 
06:23:03.030 --> 06:23:03.040 align:start position:0%
testimony is um you know could be a
 
06:23:03.040 --> 06:23:04.070 align:start position:0%
testimony is um you know could be a
costly

06:23:04.070 --> 06:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
costly
 
06:23:07.070 --> 06:23:07.080 align:start position:0%
Endeavor um I also want to be clear um
 
06:23:08.510 --> 06:23:08.520 align:start position:0%
representative verville that the
 
06:23:10.190 --> 06:23:10.200 align:start position:0%
department of education does not
 
06:23:12.948 --> 06:23:12.958 align:start position:0%
accredit schools there is a process for
 
06:23:15.390 --> 06:23:15.400 align:start position:0%
public school approval and there is a
 
06:23:17.110 --> 06:23:17.120 align:start position:0%
process for private school approval
 
06:23:18.750 --> 06:23:18.760 align:start position:0%
there's actually two tracks of private
 
06:23:20.910 --> 06:23:20.920 align:start position:0%
school approval private schools can be
 
06:23:22.910 --> 06:23:22.920 align:start position:0%
approved for attendance and they can be
 
06:23:25.150 --> 06:23:25.160 align:start position:0%
approved for their programs and in New
 
06:23:26.788 --> 06:23:26.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire sure the number of private
 
06:23:28.548 --> 06:23:28.558 align:start position:0%
schools that are approved for attendance
 
06:23:31.110 --> 06:23:31.120 align:start position:0%
only outnumbers those that are approved
 
06:23:35.430 --> 06:23:35.440 align:start position:0%
programmatically 2 to one um and so but
 
06:23:38.110 --> 06:23:38.120 align:start position:0%
in those private schools that are
 
06:23:40.548 --> 06:23:40.558 align:start position:0%
approved for programs in order to be
 
06:23:42.270 --> 06:23:42.280 align:start position:0%
approved as a program they have to seek
 
06:23:44.310 --> 06:23:44.320 align:start position:0%
accreditation from an outside agency as
 
06:23:46.708 --> 06:23:46.718 align:start position:0%
part of that um and so just to be clear
 
06:23:48.070 --> 06:23:48.080 align:start position:0%
there is a difference between approval
 
06:23:50.190 --> 06:23:50.200 align:start position:0%
and accreditation and what that means in
 
06:23:50.200 --> 06:23:51.190 align:start position:0%
and accreditation and what that means in
New

06:23:51.190 --> 06:23:51.200 align:start position:0%
New
 
06:23:53.628 --> 06:23:53.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire additionally I wanted to
 
06:23:55.948 --> 06:23:55.958 align:start position:0%
address the the issue of discrimination
 
06:23:57.350 --> 06:23:57.360 align:start position:0%
and just to be clear that private
 
06:23:59.030 --> 06:23:59.040 align:start position:0%
schools do not have to follow
 
06:24:01.270 --> 06:24:01.280 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination laws or the
 
06:24:03.750 --> 06:24:03.760 align:start position:0%
individuals with disabilities Education
 
06:24:07.030 --> 06:24:07.040 align:start position:0%
Act and their admissions procedures so I
 
06:24:08.788 --> 06:24:08.798 align:start position:0%
I I I've heard it said before and I
 
06:24:10.510 --> 06:24:10.520 align:start position:0%
completely agree that many private
 
06:24:12.948 --> 06:24:12.958 align:start position:0%
schools are inclusive and do not
 
06:24:14.788 --> 06:24:14.798 align:start position:0%
discriminate but I think it's
 
06:24:16.510 --> 06:24:16.520 align:start position:0%
unconscionable to think that our state
 
06:24:19.430 --> 06:24:19.440 align:start position:0%
would allow public dollars to perpetuate
 
06:24:22.030 --> 06:24:22.040 align:start position:0%
discriminatory practices by institutions
 
06:24:24.190 --> 06:24:24.200 align:start position:0%
who can use any criteria that they wish
 
06:24:26.310 --> 06:24:26.320 align:start position:0%
to pick and choose who they will or will
 
06:24:28.590 --> 06:24:28.600 align:start position:0%
not admit as
 
06:24:31.230 --> 06:24:31.240 align:start position:0%
students all of that um based upon all
 
06:24:33.350 --> 06:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
that I would urge you to reject or to
 
06:24:35.750 --> 06:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
move that this bill is inexpedient to
 
06:24:38.868 --> 06:24:38.878 align:start position:0%

06:25:41.430 --> 06:25:41.440 align:start position:0%
representing Nea New Hampshire uh in
 
06:25:43.750 --> 06:25:43.760 align:start position:0%
opposition to the bill um although I
 
06:25:46.670 --> 06:25:46.680 align:start position:0%
will say I am here because
 
06:25:50.270 --> 06:25:50.280 align:start position:0%
not uh was mentioned earlier you know
 
06:25:52.590 --> 06:25:52.600 align:start position:0%
our our members care deeply about uh
 
06:25:54.628 --> 06:25:54.638 align:start position:0%
public education and every child and
 
06:25:58.150 --> 06:25:58.160 align:start position:0%
that is why I'm here today um I will be
 
06:26:01.070 --> 06:26:01.080 align:start position:0%
very brief because most of the uh
 
06:26:02.750 --> 06:26:02.760 align:start position:0%
previous speaker has covered our
 
06:26:06.590 --> 06:26:06.600 align:start position:0%
concerns uh first and foremost uh was
 
06:26:09.310 --> 06:26:09.320 align:start position:0%
the the tremendous potential cost of
 
06:26:11.350 --> 06:26:11.360 align:start position:0%
this uh especially to a small school
 
06:26:13.750 --> 06:26:13.760 align:start position:0%
school district this could be
 
06:26:19.270 --> 06:26:19.280 align:start position:0%
disproportionately uh large cost um and
 
06:26:22.190 --> 06:26:22.200 align:start position:0%
at a time when you know earlier today we
 
06:26:24.390 --> 06:26:24.400 align:start position:0%
there was a hearing in house finance
 
06:26:25.910 --> 06:26:25.920 align:start position:0%
about uh
 
06:26:27.990 --> 06:26:28.000 align:start position:0%
you know supporting school districts
 
06:26:31.230 --> 06:26:31.240 align:start position:0%
during the during the pandemic for for
 
06:26:35.548 --> 06:26:35.558 align:start position:0%
the uh drop in uh adequacy that they're
 
06:26:37.788 --> 06:26:37.798 align:start position:0%
facing in this particular time there are
 
06:26:40.708 --> 06:26:40.718 align:start position:0%
so many Financial pressures on school
 
06:26:44.708 --> 06:26:44.718 align:start position:0%
districts uh that adding
 
06:26:48.948 --> 06:26:48.958 align:start position:0%
this to it uh we think would not be um
 
06:26:50.948 --> 06:26:50.958 align:start position:0%
good policy for the State of New
 
06:26:53.030 --> 06:26:53.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or for its school
 
06:26:55.948 --> 06:26:55.958 align:start position:0%
districts uh
 
06:26:58.110 --> 06:26:58.120 align:start position:0%
especially since it uh transfers both
 
06:27:02.310 --> 06:27:02.320 align:start position:0%
state and local Aid uh I would also
 
06:27:03.830 --> 06:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
reiterate some of the accountability
 
06:27:07.868 --> 06:27:07.878 align:start position:0%
issues U very concerned for example on
 
06:27:10.030 --> 06:27:10.040 align:start position:0%
page four line one that the department
 
06:27:12.390 --> 06:27:12.400 align:start position:0%
May conduct an audit of an El eligible
 
06:27:15.150 --> 06:27:15.160 align:start position:0%
students account as needed to ensure
 
06:27:16.468 --> 06:27:16.478 align:start position:0%
compliance with this
 
06:27:19.350 --> 06:27:19.360 align:start position:0%
chapter uh and also that the uh on the
 
06:27:22.830 --> 06:27:22.840 align:start position:0%
same page um it's that it's the
 
06:27:22.840 --> 06:27:23.990 align:start position:0%
same page um it's that it's the
scholarship

06:27:23.990 --> 06:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
scholarship
 
06:27:26.110 --> 06:27:26.120 align:start position:0%
organization uh
 
06:27:29.670 --> 06:27:29.680 align:start position:0%
that is is auditing accounts of
 
06:27:34.230 --> 06:27:34.240 align:start position:0%
students um I think that that probably
 
06:27:36.830 --> 06:27:36.840 align:start position:0%
belongs either with at least with the
 
06:27:40.590 --> 06:27:40.600 align:start position:0%
state or with the uh you know a public
 
06:27:42.510 --> 06:27:42.520 align:start position:0%
entity because it is public dollars that
 
06:27:43.510 --> 06:27:43.520 align:start position:0%
is being
 
06:27:43.520 --> 06:27:45.510 align:start position:0%
is being
used

06:27:45.510 --> 06:27:45.520 align:start position:0%
used
 
06:27:48.750 --> 06:27:48.760 align:start position:0%
um and then finally a lot of uh
 
06:27:52.190 --> 06:27:52.200 align:start position:0%
questions around the
 
06:27:57.150 --> 06:27:57.160 align:start position:0%
um the process of adopting this so you
 
06:27:58.868 --> 06:27:58.878 align:start position:0%
know how this would work in a
 
06:28:01.070 --> 06:28:01.080 align:start position:0%
Cooperative School District I think this
 
06:28:03.948 --> 06:28:03.958 align:start position:0%
that could be very confusing especially
 
06:28:06.150 --> 06:28:06.160 align:start position:0%
if uh there is a larger town in a
 
06:28:08.670 --> 06:28:08.680 align:start position:0%
Cooperative School District that adopts
 
06:28:12.350 --> 06:28:12.360 align:start position:0%
this uh when you know smaller town in
 
06:28:16.150 --> 06:28:16.160 align:start position:0%
that District uh may not want it um I
 
06:28:18.590 --> 06:28:18.600 align:start position:0%
think that could be very confusing as to
 
06:28:21.230 --> 06:28:21.240 align:start position:0%
how that could work and potentially uh
 
06:28:23.230 --> 06:28:23.240 align:start position:0%
an even greater burden on that smaller
 
06:28:26.548 --> 06:28:26.558 align:start position:0%
community and finally um you know I
 
06:28:28.670 --> 06:28:28.680 align:start position:0%
think if this is going to be put on a
 
06:28:33.110 --> 06:28:33.120 align:start position:0%
warrant uh warrants include um fiscal
 
06:28:36.110 --> 06:28:36.120 align:start position:0%
notes they include uh as what it's going
 
06:28:39.868 --> 06:28:39.878 align:start position:0%
to cost and I don't see that um in this
 
06:28:42.548 --> 06:28:42.558 align:start position:0%
bill there's no
 
06:28:45.430 --> 06:28:45.440 align:start position:0%
um you know how will we give local uh
 
06:28:48.788 --> 06:28:48.798 align:start position:0%
taxpayers an idea of what approving uh
 
06:28:50.750 --> 06:28:50.760 align:start position:0%
something like this could potentially
 
06:28:53.150 --> 06:28:53.160 align:start position:0%
cost I don't I'm not sure there is a
 
06:28:54.350 --> 06:28:54.360 align:start position:0%
good way to do it and the bill certainly
 
06:28:57.310 --> 06:28:57.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't outline that
 
06:29:00.270 --> 06:29:00.280 align:start position:0%
um with that I'll close my testimony and
 
06:29:02.110 --> 06:29:02.120 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions thank you
 
06:29:04.868 --> 06:29:04.878 align:start position:0%
very much Brian Hawkins are there
 
06:29:06.390 --> 06:29:06.400 align:start position:0%
questions for
 
06:29:10.030 --> 06:29:10.040 align:start position:0%
Brian don't see any don't see any thank
 
06:29:12.750 --> 06:29:12.760 align:start position:0%
you very much Brian thank you very
 
06:29:15.948 --> 06:29:15.958 align:start position:0%
much okay uh we have a person who's been
 
06:29:18.230 --> 06:29:18.240 align:start position:0%
waiting in the waiting room I believe

she's a member of the public net dala
 
06:29:25.590 --> 06:29:25.600 align:start position:0%
sorry the name cut off at the end
 
06:29:28.150 --> 06:29:28.160 align:start position:0%
so if you're there go ahead and and
 
06:29:28.160 --> 06:29:31.628 align:start position:0%
so if you're there go ahead and and
speak

06:29:31.628 --> 06:29:31.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:35.150 --> 06:29:35.160 align:start position:0%
up hi can you hear me yes we can there
 
06:29:38.990 --> 06:29:39.000 align:start position:0%
we go um hi my name is Nicolet gallago
 
06:29:40.788 --> 06:29:40.798 align:start position:0%
I'm in Dover New
 
06:29:43.948 --> 06:29:43.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um I am a product of New
 
06:29:46.868 --> 06:29:46.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's fantastic Public Schools I
 
06:29:48.270 --> 06:29:48.280 align:start position:0%
went to
 
06:29:51.750 --> 06:29:51.760 align:start position:0%
conal um I love that school I love the
 
06:29:55.628 --> 06:29:55.638 align:start position:0%
education that I was given um as a
 
06:29:58.750 --> 06:29:58.760 align:start position:0%
benefit of where my parents happened to
 
06:30:03.430 --> 06:30:03.440 align:start position:0%
live and I think that my difficulty with
 
06:30:07.830 --> 06:30:07.840 align:start position:0%
this bill and why I oppose this bill is
 
06:30:09.548 --> 06:30:09.558 align:start position:0%
because of that experience because I had
 
06:30:11.310 --> 06:30:11.320 align:start position:0%
such a great Public School experience
 
06:30:15.548 --> 06:30:15.558 align:start position:0%
and I I think I'm disturbed by the
 
06:30:18.830 --> 06:30:18.840 align:start position:0%
idea that folks would move to a
 
06:30:21.670 --> 06:30:21.680 align:start position:0%
community be involved in it and then
 
06:30:24.390 --> 06:30:24.400 align:start position:0%
take their kids right out of the school
 
06:30:24.400 --> 06:30:25.590 align:start position:0%
take their kids right out of the school
um

06:30:25.590 --> 06:30:25.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:30:27.270 --> 06:30:27.280 align:start position:0%
I think that our public schools are a
 
06:30:29.310 --> 06:30:29.320 align:start position:0%
pride and something that we should be
 
06:30:32.510 --> 06:30:32.520 align:start position:0%
investing in in every opportunity and
 
06:30:35.310 --> 06:30:35.320 align:start position:0%
something that our constitution
 
06:30:38.070 --> 06:30:38.080 align:start position:0%
understood right that our Founders
 
06:30:42.270 --> 06:30:42.280 align:start position:0%
understood and valued and um and I I'd
 
06:30:44.548 --> 06:30:44.558 align:start position:0%
like to see us pursuing it from the
 
06:30:46.350 --> 06:30:46.360 align:start position:0%
angle of how we
 
06:30:49.190 --> 06:30:49.200 align:start position:0%
ensure every student has access to the
 
06:30:52.990 --> 06:30:53.000 align:start position:0%
best education in the public school not
 
06:30:55.990 --> 06:30:56.000 align:start position:0%
how do we get kids in into special
 
06:30:59.350 --> 06:30:59.360 align:start position:0%
schools outside of the public school
 
06:31:02.910 --> 06:31:02.920 align:start position:0%
system um there have been a lot of
 
06:31:06.070 --> 06:31:06.080 align:start position:0%
questions a lot of testimony one of my
 
06:31:08.388 --> 06:31:08.398 align:start position:0%
questions is actually for representative
 
06:31:10.868 --> 06:31:10.878 align:start position:0%
veral um one of the things that he
 
06:31:12.548 --> 06:31:12.558 align:start position:0%
mentioned very early on in his
 
06:31:15.110 --> 06:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
presentation was suggesting that kids
 
06:31:19.270 --> 06:31:19.280 align:start position:0%
who are in a school can't change to
 
06:31:21.030 --> 06:31:21.040 align:start position:0%
another school that's not been my
 
06:31:24.910 --> 06:31:24.920 align:start position:0%
experience in Dover I have uh a child in
 
06:31:29.788 --> 06:31:29.798 align:start position:0%
the school and I asked if I could put
 
06:31:32.230 --> 06:31:32.240 align:start position:0%
him into another school and they
 
06:31:34.070 --> 06:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
accommodated that for the elementary
 
06:31:36.910 --> 06:31:36.920 align:start position:0%
school so um I don't think that that's a
 
06:31:39.310 --> 06:31:39.320 align:start position:0%
a uh
 
06:31:42.430 --> 06:31:42.440 align:start position:0%
Statewide concern so I I I was surprised
 
06:31:44.350 --> 06:31:44.360 align:start position:0%
by that suggestion I I imagine I don't
 
06:31:45.430 --> 06:31:45.440 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to ask questions
 
06:31:47.548 --> 06:31:47.558 align:start position:0%
but I did want to bring it up because my
 
06:31:49.948 --> 06:31:49.958 align:start position:0%
neighborhood school is not the school
 
06:31:53.548 --> 06:31:53.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:57.548 --> 06:31:57.558 align:start position:0%
in um um and yeah and otherwise I just
 
06:32:00.670 --> 06:32:00.680 align:start position:0%
my my I oppose this I think we should be
 
06:32:01.990 --> 06:32:02.000 align:start position:0%
moving in a different direction we
 
06:32:05.270 --> 06:32:05.280 align:start position:0%
should be looking at the um commission
 
06:32:07.070 --> 06:32:07.080 align:start position:0%
that was put together and the suggestion
 
06:32:09.310 --> 06:32:09.320 align:start position:0%
there and they certainly didn't suggest
 
06:32:12.830 --> 06:32:12.840 align:start position:0%
that we should divert public money into
 
06:32:14.948 --> 06:32:14.958 align:start position:0%
private schools there's a reason for
 
06:32:17.830 --> 06:32:17.840 align:start position:0%
that um and I hope that we can do better
 
06:32:22.350 --> 06:32:22.360 align:start position:0%
for our kids thank you much
 
06:32:25.430 --> 06:32:25.440 align:start position:0%
n okay lastly we have
 
06:32:28.510 --> 06:32:28.520 align:start position:0%
uh car lad from the New Hampshire school
 
06:32:28.520 --> 06:32:31.030 align:start position:0%
uh car lad from the New Hampshire school
administrators

06:32:31.030 --> 06:32:31.040 align:start position:0%
administrators
 
06:32:33.788 --> 06:32:33.798 align:start position:0%
Association okay go ahead Mr
 
06:32:44.868 --> 06:32:44.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:47.030 --> 06:32:47.040 align:start position:0%
Lad good afternoon thank you very much
 
06:32:50.070 --> 06:32:50.080 align:start position:0%
for taking my testimony um this is the
 
06:32:52.388 --> 06:32:52.398 align:start position:0%
the third time that I've signed up to
 
06:32:55.868 --> 06:32:55.878 align:start position:0%
speak and um and somehow I don't make it
 
06:32:57.910 --> 06:32:57.920 align:start position:0%
on the list I'm starting to get a
 
06:33:01.388 --> 06:33:01.398 align:start position:0%
complex um but thank you uh Mr chairman
 
06:33:03.628 --> 06:33:03.638 align:start position:0%
thank you members of House Ed um and
 
06:33:05.350 --> 06:33:05.360 align:start position:0%
certainly uh thank you representative
 
06:33:09.190 --> 06:33:09.200 align:start position:0%
veral uh for your testimony uh and uh
 
06:33:12.910 --> 06:33:12.920 align:start position:0%
your presentation um while we understand
 
06:33:15.070 --> 06:33:15.080 align:start position:0%
the intent of the bill is to expand
 
06:33:17.468 --> 06:33:17.478 align:start position:0%
opportunities we really feel uh that
 
06:33:18.830 --> 06:33:18.840 align:start position:0%
this bill is only providing
 
06:33:21.548 --> 06:33:21.558 align:start position:0%
opportunities for some uh rather than
 
06:33:26.230 --> 06:33:26.240 align:start position:0%
all uh nhsaa is going to oppose 607 um
 
06:33:28.990 --> 06:33:29.000 align:start position:0%
primarily because it raises so many
 
06:33:30.948 --> 06:33:30.958 align:start position:0%
concerns and questions I'm not going to
 
06:33:33.388 --> 06:33:33.398 align:start position:0%
go back over all of the questions and
 
06:33:35.670 --> 06:33:35.680 align:start position:0%
and concerns that were raised but but a
 
06:33:37.868 --> 06:33:37.878 align:start position:0%
couple of things that I really would
 
06:33:42.190 --> 06:33:42.200 align:start position:0%
like to respond to um one of the things
 
06:33:45.310 --> 06:33:45.320 align:start position:0%
that um the uh representative Ville
 
06:33:48.270 --> 06:33:48.280 align:start position:0%
spoke uh about is the best interests of
 
06:33:52.230 --> 06:33:52.240 align:start position:0%
the student and uh ensuring that we do
 
06:33:54.750 --> 06:33:54.760 align:start position:0%
whatever is in the best interest of the
 
06:33:58.270 --> 06:33:58.280 align:start position:0%
student um and if that's going to be the
 
06:34:01.388 --> 06:34:01.398 align:start position:0%
metric that we use then shouldn't that
 
06:34:03.110 --> 06:34:03.120 align:start position:0%
be written
 
06:34:07.510 --> 06:34:07.520 align:start position:0%
into uh any definition of what uh the
 
06:34:09.468 --> 06:34:09.478 align:start position:0%
content of an adequate education should
 
06:34:12.310 --> 06:34:12.320 align:start position:0%
be and how we then fund it uh because
 
06:34:14.830 --> 06:34:14.840 align:start position:0%
the best interest of a student is not
 
06:34:18.110 --> 06:34:18.120 align:start position:0%
the same as an adequate education which
 
06:34:20.548 --> 06:34:20.558 align:start position:0%
is what the Constitution requires and
 
06:34:23.990 --> 06:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
what is being funded so um local school
 
06:34:26.510 --> 06:34:26.520 align:start position:0%
districts go above and beyond what the
 
06:34:30.948 --> 06:34:30.958 align:start position:0%
state determines to be adequate um but
 
06:34:34.510 --> 06:34:34.520 align:start position:0%
the the state does not so I'm I'm
 
06:34:36.628 --> 06:34:36.638 align:start position:0%
interested to know if we can start
 
06:34:38.910 --> 06:34:38.920 align:start position:0%
talking about costing out the best
 
06:34:41.230 --> 06:34:41.240 align:start position:0%
interests of students uh rather than
 
06:34:42.788 --> 06:34:42.798 align:start position:0%
just um
 
06:34:45.830 --> 06:34:45.840 align:start position:0%
adequacy and then the the other piece
 
06:34:47.468 --> 06:34:47.478 align:start position:0%
I'm going to submit written testimony
 
06:34:50.708 --> 06:34:50.718 align:start position:0%
that goes line by line uh with
 
06:34:53.708 --> 06:34:53.718 align:start position:0%
questions but one of the things that uh
 
06:34:57.468 --> 06:34:57.478 align:start position:0%
keeps being raised um and and I don't
 
06:34:59.948 --> 06:34:59.958 align:start position:0%
think we talk enough about this uh we
 
06:35:02.030 --> 06:35:02.040 align:start position:0%
talk about public education as a
 
06:35:04.270 --> 06:35:04.280 align:start position:0%
monopoly um that school choice is
 
06:35:07.510 --> 06:35:07.520 align:start position:0%
somehow going to drive competition um
 
06:35:09.468 --> 06:35:09.478 align:start position:0%
and that competition is the foundation
 
06:35:12.310 --> 06:35:12.320 align:start position:0%
of a market economy if public education
 
06:35:15.350 --> 06:35:15.360 align:start position:0%
were a commodity then I would say yes
 
06:35:17.948 --> 06:35:17.958 align:start position:0%
that argument fits however public
 
06:35:19.948 --> 06:35:19.958 align:start position:0%
education is not a commodity to be
 
06:35:22.628 --> 06:35:22.638 align:start position:0%
traded on the open market it's a Civic
 
06:35:24.990 --> 06:35:25.000 align:start position:0%
and Community responsibility to its
 
06:35:27.388 --> 06:35:27.398 align:start position:0%
citizens we've enshrined that in the New
 
06:35:29.510 --> 06:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution more so than
 
06:35:33.230 --> 06:35:33.240 align:start position:0%
other states um it's a contract that we
 
06:35:38.670 --> 06:35:38.680 align:start position:0%
signed between the communities and the
 
06:35:40.948 --> 06:35:40.958 align:start position:0%
um and the school system part of that
 
06:35:44.070 --> 06:35:44.080 align:start position:0%
Civic contract that we have is a public
 
06:35:46.868 --> 06:35:46.878 align:start position:0%
education that benefits all students not
 
06:35:49.590 --> 06:35:49.600 align:start position:0%
just those who can afford it and not
 
06:35:51.548 --> 06:35:51.558 align:start position:0%
just those who have the ability to
 
06:35:55.030 --> 06:35:55.040 align:start position:0%
access these alternative opportunities
 
06:35:57.590 --> 06:35:57.600 align:start position:0%
because not all students will be able to
 
06:35:59.270 --> 06:35:59.280 align:start position:0%
there aren't many private schools in the
 
06:36:01.230 --> 06:36:01.240 align:start position:0%
North Country you're not going to be
 
06:36:04.110 --> 06:36:04.120 align:start position:0%
able to get a lot of kids out of a
 
06:36:07.388 --> 06:36:07.398 align:start position:0%
public school and have them go somewhere
 
06:36:09.868 --> 06:36:09.878 align:start position:0%
else it's it's simply not going to
 
06:36:12.270 --> 06:36:12.280 align:start position:0%
happen so we're providing opportunities
 
06:36:16.510 --> 06:36:16.520 align:start position:0%
for some but not for all and the last um
 
06:36:18.868 --> 06:36:18.878 align:start position:0%
comment that I'll make um is really I
 
06:36:22.030 --> 06:36:22.040 align:start position:0%
question the haste of this bill in
 
06:36:23.868 --> 06:36:23.878 align:start position:0%
addition to all of the other school
 
06:36:26.190 --> 06:36:26.200 align:start position:0%
voucher program bills and school choice
 
06:36:28.110 --> 06:36:28.120 align:start position:0%
things that are being kind of pushed
 
06:36:32.030 --> 06:36:32.040 align:start position:0%
through um is there a reason why we are
 
06:36:35.310 --> 06:36:35.320 align:start position:0%
um reaching um while we're creating such
 
06:36:35.320 --> 06:36:36.350 align:start position:0%
um reaching um while we're creating such
far-reaching

06:36:36.350 --> 06:36:36.360 align:start position:0%
far-reaching
 
06:36:38.868 --> 06:36:38.878 align:start position:0%
policy considerations on such a
 
06:36:42.830 --> 06:36:42.840 align:start position:0%
shortterm basis um if these are bills
 
06:36:46.628 --> 06:36:46.638 align:start position:0%
that are truly um interested in the
 
06:36:49.070 --> 06:36:49.080 align:start position:0%
public good and public education
 
06:36:51.990 --> 06:36:52.000 align:start position:0%
students and families and taxpayers then
 
06:36:54.310 --> 06:36:54.320 align:start position:0%
we should be seeing fiscal notes
 
06:36:56.670 --> 06:36:56.680 align:start position:0%
attached to these and there should be I
 
06:36:59.070 --> 06:36:59.080 align:start position:0%
think maybe a more comprehensive
 
06:37:01.910 --> 06:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
approach to how we're looking at it to
 
06:37:04.868 --> 06:37:04.878 align:start position:0%
some extent these bills um are being a
 
06:37:08.670 --> 06:37:08.680 align:start position:0%
knee-jerk reaction to covid uh because
 
06:37:11.510 --> 06:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
I'm hearing a lot of uh testimony and
 
06:37:13.750 --> 06:37:13.760 align:start position:0%
support of these bills because of covid
 
06:37:16.388 --> 06:37:16.398 align:start position:0%
related school closures and things like
 
06:37:18.388 --> 06:37:18.398 align:start position:0%
that I I'm not sure that in the middle
 
06:37:20.708 --> 06:37:20.718 align:start position:0%
of a pandemic is the best time for us to
 
06:37:23.708 --> 06:37:23.718 align:start position:0%
completely upend public school policy
 
06:37:25.868 --> 06:37:25.878 align:start position:0%
and complet completely change it uh
 
06:37:29.190 --> 06:37:29.200 align:start position:0%
without more careful thought um and some
 
06:37:32.628 --> 06:37:32.638 align:start position:0%
processes in place um if we're really
 
06:37:35.670 --> 06:37:35.680 align:start position:0%
interested in expanding opportunities
 
06:37:38.230 --> 06:37:38.240 align:start position:0%
and choices then it would seem to make
 
06:37:40.670 --> 06:37:40.680 align:start position:0%
sense that we should come up with a path
 
06:37:43.468 --> 06:37:43.478 align:start position:0%
forward that's agreed to by everyone um
 
06:37:46.590 --> 06:37:46.600 align:start position:0%
and right now um this doesn't seem to do
 
06:37:50.468 --> 06:37:50.478 align:start position:0%
it so on because the bill raises so many
 
06:37:51.948 --> 06:37:51.958 align:start position:0%
questions and I think it's really being
 
06:37:53.510 --> 06:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
pushed forward too quickly without
 
06:37:56.270 --> 06:37:56.280 align:start position:0%
enough time for real consideration and
 
06:37:58.910 --> 06:37:58.920 align:start position:0%
debate um we respectfully urge you to
 
06:38:02.788 --> 06:38:02.798 align:start position:0%
vote no on uh HB 607 thanks very much
 
06:38:04.990 --> 06:38:05.000 align:start position:0%
for your time and I'll certainly take
 
06:38:08.110 --> 06:38:08.120 align:start position:0%
any questions thank you very much Dr Lad
 
06:38:11.230 --> 06:38:11.240 align:start position:0%
um I apologize if you've ended up last
 
06:38:14.110 --> 06:38:14.120 align:start position:0%
on the list no no problem I don't mind
 
06:38:16.110 --> 06:38:16.120 align:start position:0%
being last I just I just don't want to
 
06:38:20.548 --> 06:38:20.558 align:start position:0%
not be called okay um I I I'm curious to
 
06:38:22.468 --> 06:38:22.478 align:start position:0%
know when did you sign up because that
 
06:38:24.750 --> 06:38:24.760 align:start position:0%
might be part of what I'm seeing here
 
06:38:26.310 --> 06:38:26.320 align:start position:0%
some of them have been signed up for
 
06:38:29.270 --> 06:38:29.280 align:start position:0%
quite a while I signed up over the
 
06:38:32.948 --> 06:38:32.958 align:start position:0%
weekend okay we do have one more speaker
 
06:38:35.708 --> 06:38:35.718 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much you're very
 
06:38:39.030 --> 06:38:39.040 align:start position:0%
welcome we do have one more speaker uh
 
06:38:41.708 --> 06:38:41.718 align:start position:0%
representative Josh yella you've been
 
06:38:45.430 --> 06:38:45.440 align:start position:0%
promoted welcome to the education
 
06:38:49.030 --> 06:38:49.040 align:start position:0%
committee thank you Mr chairman and
 
06:38:51.150 --> 06:38:51.160 align:start position:0%
thank you members of the committee for
 
06:38:54.868 --> 06:38:54.878 align:start position:0%
hearing my testimony I am uh co-sponsor
 
06:38:58.910 --> 06:38:58.920 align:start position:0%
on this bill so I would like to uh thank
 
06:39:00.628 --> 06:39:00.638 align:start position:0%
representative vervo for bringing this
 
06:39:04.388 --> 06:39:04.398 align:start position:0%
issue forward and as a part of this
 
06:39:07.868 --> 06:39:07.878 align:start position:0%
hearing I wanted I heard some um
 
06:39:12.468 --> 06:39:12.478 align:start position:0%
questions being raised which I thought I
 
06:39:16.310 --> 06:39:16.320 align:start position:0%
might um bring a perspective
 
06:39:20.150 --> 06:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
uh to the committee's attention
 
06:39:25.350 --> 06:39:25.360 align:start position:0%
I it's often been uh mentioned in these
 
06:39:27.750 --> 06:39:27.760 align:start position:0%
uh in the testimonies I've heard today
 
06:39:32.750 --> 06:39:32.760 align:start position:0%
that there is a need
 
06:39:36.708 --> 06:39:36.718 align:start position:0%
for the cost uh a fiscal note on this
 
06:39:41.670 --> 06:39:41.680 align:start position:0%
bill and I question whether or not that
 
06:39:46.230 --> 06:39:46.240 align:start position:0%
is even possible with a legislation that
 
06:39:50.750 --> 06:39:50.760 align:start position:0%
is enabling because the cost
 
06:39:50.760 --> 06:39:52.548 align:start position:0%
is enabling because the cost
of

06:39:52.548 --> 06:39:52.558 align:start position:0%
of
 
06:39:54.750 --> 06:39:54.760 align:start position:0%
maintaining uh you know the Department
 
06:39:58.750 --> 06:39:58.760 align:start position:0%
of Education staff etc etc will depend
 
06:40:02.230 --> 06:40:02.240 align:start position:0%
greatly on how many people or how many
 
06:40:05.110 --> 06:40:05.120 align:start position:0%
towns choose to adopt this
 
06:40:07.910 --> 06:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
legislation and if there are no
 
06:40:10.628 --> 06:40:10.638 align:start position:0%
towns like uh previous
 
06:40:14.030 --> 06:40:14.040 align:start position:0%
speaker hinted might be then there would
 
06:40:17.510 --> 06:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
be potentially no cost to any of the
 
06:40:21.430 --> 06:40:21.440 align:start position:0%
towns or to the Department of Education
 
06:40:24.468 --> 06:40:24.478 align:start position:0%
and so I just wanted to bring bring that
 
06:40:28.430 --> 06:40:28.440 align:start position:0%
to the committee's attention um
 
06:40:31.468 --> 06:40:31.478 align:start position:0%
as possibly not something that would
 
06:40:34.708 --> 06:40:34.718 align:start position:0%
hinder uh a vote going forward and
 
06:40:37.388 --> 06:40:37.398 align:start position:0%
whether or not you get a fiscal note
 
06:40:39.510 --> 06:40:39.520 align:start position:0%
because it's possible that it could
 
06:40:44.110 --> 06:40:44.120 align:start position:0%
range from zero to you know any amount
 
06:40:47.670 --> 06:40:47.680 align:start position:0%
of money so thank you for for uh hearing
 
06:40:50.070 --> 06:40:50.080 align:start position:0%
my testimony today thank you very much
 
06:40:50.080 --> 06:40:51.510 align:start position:0%
my testimony today thank you very much
representative

06:40:51.510 --> 06:40:51.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:40:55.510 --> 06:40:55.520 align:start position:0%
K okay well we have a
 
06:40:55.520 --> 06:40:57.190 align:start position:0%
K okay well we have a
question

06:40:57.190 --> 06:40:57.200 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:40:57.200 --> 06:40:58.708 align:start position:0%
question
question

06:40:58.708 --> 06:40:58.718 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:41:00.910 --> 06:41:00.920 align:start position:0%
represent thank you Mr chairman and
 
06:41:02.350 --> 06:41:02.360 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for taking the
 
06:41:04.628 --> 06:41:04.638 align:start position:0%
question you're from Fremont I believe
 
06:41:07.670 --> 06:41:07.680 align:start position:0%
so um what do you think um since any
 
06:41:09.910 --> 06:41:09.920 align:start position:0%
homeschooled student would be eligible
 
06:41:12.628 --> 06:41:12.638 align:start position:0%
for this uh if Fremont adopted it at any
 
06:41:15.030 --> 06:41:15.040 align:start position:0%
time um let's say Fremont adopted it
 
06:41:16.788 --> 06:41:16.798 align:start position:0%
next year how many homeschool students
 
06:41:18.468 --> 06:41:18.478 align:start position:0%
do you estimate there to be in Fremont
 
06:41:22.830 --> 06:41:22.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:22.840 --> 06:41:25.628 align:start position:0%
 
District

06:41:25.628 --> 06:41:25.638 align:start position:0%
District
 
06:41:28.430 --> 06:41:28.440 align:start position:0%
thank you representative and thank you
 
06:41:33.948 --> 06:41:33.958 align:start position:0%
uh for asking the question um in my
 
06:41:37.548 --> 06:41:37.558 align:start position:0%
district uh as was previously mentioned
 
06:41:41.430 --> 06:41:41.440 align:start position:0%
it it can be hard to quantify how many
 
06:41:44.270 --> 06:41:44.280 align:start position:0%
um people are homeschoolers but
 
06:41:47.430 --> 06:41:47.440 align:start position:0%
definitely there are more homeschoolers
 
06:41:50.350 --> 06:41:50.360 align:start position:0%
this year than previous I think we asked
 
06:41:53.830 --> 06:41:53.840 align:start position:0%
the school uh so I'm a part of the
 
06:41:56.190 --> 06:41:56.200 align:start position:0%
budget Committee in my town and so I
 
06:41:59.030 --> 06:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
believe we asked the school this year I
 
06:42:01.350 --> 06:42:01.360 align:start position:0%
think it was me that asked how many
 
06:42:04.510 --> 06:42:04.520 align:start position:0%
people had moved to
 
06:42:08.548 --> 06:42:08.558 align:start position:0%
um to uh homeschooling or other options
 
06:42:11.230 --> 06:42:11.240 align:start position:0%
because of uh the schooling challenges
 
06:42:15.350 --> 06:42:15.360 align:start position:0%
this year and I believe the the amount
 
06:42:15.360 --> 06:42:16.230 align:start position:0%
this year and I believe the the amount
of

06:42:16.230 --> 06:42:16.240 align:start position:0%
of
 
06:42:20.150 --> 06:42:20.160 align:start position:0%
money is or the amount of people is
 
06:42:24.310 --> 06:42:24.320 align:start position:0%
around 10 to 15 people in our town
 
06:42:28.830 --> 06:42:28.840 align:start position:0%
and there's also uh in my town we are um
 
06:42:31.310 --> 06:42:31.320 align:start position:0%
have a tuition contract with
 
06:42:35.230 --> 06:42:35.240 align:start position:0%
another uh school for our high school
 
06:42:39.388 --> 06:42:39.398 align:start position:0%
and we are in the process of um coming
 
06:42:43.030 --> 06:42:43.040 align:start position:0%
to the end of that contract and want to
 
06:42:44.990 --> 06:42:45.000 align:start position:0%
explore other
 
06:42:48.628 --> 06:42:48.638 align:start position:0%
options because of the place that we are
 
06:42:52.468 --> 06:42:52.478 align:start position:0%
tuition tuition to are very expensive
 
06:42:54.868 --> 06:42:54.878 align:start position:0%
and so we are looking at our different
 
06:42:58.270 --> 06:42:58.280 align:start position:0%
options and uh I
 
06:43:01.270 --> 06:43:01.280 align:start position:0%
would like to be able to
 
06:43:01.280 --> 06:43:03.190 align:start position:0%
would like to be able to
propose

06:43:03.190 --> 06:43:03.200 align:start position:0%
propose
 
06:43:09.948 --> 06:43:09.958 align:start position:0%
some options like this bill in in uh in
 
06:43:13.788 --> 06:43:13.798 align:start position:0%
our town so I I definitely think that uh
 
06:43:13.798 --> 06:43:15.430 align:start position:0%
our town so I I definitely think that uh
our

06:43:15.430 --> 06:43:15.440 align:start position:0%
our
 
06:43:19.788 --> 06:43:19.798 align:start position:0%
town current uh cost per pupil is
 
06:43:24.230 --> 06:43:24.240 align:start position:0%
around uh 15,000 per
 
06:43:26.590 --> 06:43:26.600 align:start position:0%
per per student but that's including
 
06:43:30.430 --> 06:43:30.440 align:start position:0%
special education so it's it's hard to
 
06:43:33.628 --> 06:43:33.638 align:start position:0%
um know what the number would be minus
 
06:43:36.030 --> 06:43:36.040 align:start position:0%
uh special education because we don't
 
06:43:37.510 --> 06:43:37.520 align:start position:0%
actually deal with that in the budget
 
06:43:39.510 --> 06:43:39.520 align:start position:0%
committee so thank you for the question
 
06:43:47.190 --> 06:43:47.200 align:start position:0%

talked about um looking for options um
 
06:44:05.548 --> 06:44:05.558 align:start position:0%
and I was wondering if you took a look
 
06:44:08.230 --> 06:44:08.240 align:start position:0%
at any of the recommendations offered by
 
06:44:10.830 --> 06:44:10.840 align:start position:0%
the school funding commission that would
 
06:44:15.310 --> 06:44:15.320 align:start position:0%
improve not only student Equity by um U
 
06:44:18.628 --> 06:44:18.638 align:start position:0%
for for your town of Fremont but also um
 
06:44:21.708 --> 06:44:21.718 align:start position:0%
also tax Equity uh equity for your
 
06:44:24.670 --> 06:44:24.680 align:start position:0%
taxpayers and reduce your tax rate by
 
06:44:28.990 --> 06:44:29.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:31.310 --> 06:44:31.320 align:start position:0%
thousand thank you representative for
 
06:44:34.670 --> 06:44:34.680 align:start position:0%
the question are we actually have formed
 
06:44:38.388 --> 06:44:38.398 align:start position:0%
a committee to look at all of our
 
06:44:43.590 --> 06:44:43.600 align:start position:0%
options and uh our that committee is
 
06:44:46.990 --> 06:44:47.000 align:start position:0%
work is still in progress so I'm not
 
06:44:48.868 --> 06:44:48.878 align:start position:0%
actually on that committee so I don't
 
06:44:51.468 --> 06:44:51.478 align:start position:0%
know what all the options they have
 
06:44:53.510 --> 06:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
considered but they are consider
 
06:44:55.670 --> 06:44:55.680 align:start position:0%
considering a number of options and a
 
06:44:58.030 --> 06:44:58.040 align:start position:0%
number of school districts which we may
 
06:45:00.310 --> 06:45:00.320 align:start position:0%
tuition our students to but thank you

06:46:03.030 --> 06:46:03.040 align:start position:0%
communication um realizing that I'm uh I
 
06:46:05.150 --> 06:46:05.160 align:start position:0%

of revision to do as I testify so uh
 
06:46:11.270 --> 06:46:11.280 align:start position:0%
please forgive me if I'm a little bit
 
06:46:13.590 --> 06:46:13.600 align:start position:0%
disjoint but I will try very hard to be
 
06:46:15.750 --> 06:46:15.760 align:start position:0%
brief and to not repeat things that have
 
06:46:19.388 --> 06:46:19.398 align:start position:0%
been said already um I am Tom St Martin
 
06:46:22.110 --> 06:46:22.120 align:start position:0%
I am from Candia I am a former State Rep
 
06:46:23.708 --> 06:46:23.718 align:start position:0%
having served back in the 90s though I
 
06:46:25.190 --> 06:46:25.200 align:start position:0%
am appearing here today only
 
06:46:27.910 --> 06:46:27.920 align:start position:0%
representing myself I am not a teacher I
 
06:46:29.548 --> 06:46:29.558 align:start position:0%
have no relatives who are teachers no
 
06:46:31.990 --> 06:46:32.000 align:start position:0%
descendants in public or private school
 
06:46:34.190 --> 06:46:34.200 align:start position:0%
I am a taxpayer I have been and I
 
06:46:36.548 --> 06:46:36.558 align:start position:0%
continue to be cheerfully willing to pay
 
06:46:39.350 --> 06:46:39.360 align:start position:0%
my taxes though I have no direct benefit
 
06:46:41.230 --> 06:46:41.240 align:start position:0%
I simply support public education
 
06:46:43.628 --> 06:46:43.638 align:start position:0%
answerable to the public as the Bedrock
 
06:46:46.230 --> 06:46:46.240 align:start position:0%
of our society I'm the product of both
 
06:46:48.430 --> 06:46:48.440 align:start position:0%
parochial and public schools including a
 
06:46:50.350 --> 06:46:50.360 align:start position:0%
two- room Schoolhouse that once served
 
06:46:52.910 --> 06:46:52.920 align:start position:0%
sixth grades I have known many fine
 
06:46:54.830 --> 06:46:54.840 align:start position:0%
teachers both public and private as well
 
06:46:56.190 --> 06:46:56.200 align:start position:0%
as school board
 
06:46:57.830 --> 06:46:57.840 align:start position:0%
members I thought it was very
 
06:46:59.150 --> 06:46:59.160 align:start position:0%
interesting to hear the claim that there
 
06:47:01.190 --> 06:47:01.200 align:start position:0%
are no Public Schools I assure you
 
06:47:03.110 --> 06:47:03.120 align:start position:0%
Candia has a public school funded with
 
06:47:05.030 --> 06:47:05.040 align:start position:0%
public taxes from each and every
 
06:47:07.030 --> 06:47:07.040 align:start position:0%
taxpayer and with public oversight both
 
06:47:08.788 --> 06:47:08.798 align:start position:0%
through district meetings and a publicly
 
06:47:10.750 --> 06:47:10.760 align:start position:0%
elected school board and a budget
 
06:47:12.990 --> 06:47:13.000 align:start position:0%
committee I appreciate representative
 
06:47:15.350 --> 06:47:15.360 align:start position:0%
bal's characterization of our school is
 
06:47:17.510 --> 06:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
excellent apparently our public
 
06:47:19.910 --> 06:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
oversight is working the question
 
06:47:21.388 --> 06:47:21.398 align:start position:0%
becomes why aren't we trying to figure
 
06:47:23.670 --> 06:47:23.680 align:start position:0%
out why some districts do well and how
 
06:47:26.350 --> 06:47:26.360 align:start position:0%
can we apply that to other schools I'm
 
06:47:27.990 --> 06:47:28.000 align:start position:0%
disappointed that there appear to be few
 
06:47:30.388 --> 06:47:30.398 align:start position:0%
attempts to directly improve our our
 
06:47:33.150 --> 06:47:33.160 align:start position:0%
public education system instead we focus
 
06:47:34.948 --> 06:47:34.958 align:start position:0%
on kicking the can down the road to the
 
06:47:37.910 --> 06:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
perceived Panacea of competition please
 
06:47:39.548 --> 06:47:39.558 align:start position:0%
note that I'm not advocating the
 
06:47:41.070 --> 06:47:41.080 align:start position:0%
anything for the perennial school
 
06:47:43.350 --> 06:47:43.360 align:start position:0%
funding issue I'd like to see us Focus
 
06:47:46.310 --> 06:47:46.320 align:start position:0%
as a state on identifying best practices
 
06:47:48.270 --> 06:47:48.280 align:start position:0%
rather than rely on voucher programs to
 
06:47:49.510 --> 06:47:49.520 align:start position:0%
evolve our
 
06:47:52.350 --> 06:47:52.360 align:start position:0%
approach I'm also a little surprised at
 
06:47:56.590 --> 06:47:56.600 align:start position:0%
HP 607 as well as uh HP 20 for
 
06:47:58.750 --> 06:47:58.760 align:start position:0%
establishing another bureaucratic entry
 
06:48:01.990 --> 06:48:02.000 align:start position:0%
entity with no apparent public oversight
 
06:48:04.670 --> 06:48:04.680 align:start position:0%
to administer public funds granted the
 
06:48:08.150 --> 06:48:08.160 align:start position:0%
doe is exists but I know that they are
 
06:48:11.670 --> 06:48:11.680 align:start position:0%
overworked um I also do not consider
 
06:48:14.468 --> 06:48:14.478 align:start position:0%
them public oversight in the way that
 
06:48:18.070 --> 06:48:18.080 align:start position:0%
for example a local school board is so
 
06:48:20.150 --> 06:48:20.160 align:start position:0%
uh the details of financial audits are
 
06:48:22.590 --> 06:48:22.600 align:start position:0%
blurry I see no detail of any assessment
 
06:48:26.190 --> 06:48:26.200 align:start position:0%
of outcomes or programs as as a whole it
 
06:48:28.868 --> 06:48:28.878 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem to increase uh any
 
06:48:31.590 --> 06:48:31.600 align:start position:0%
efficiency and I would suggest that it
 
06:48:34.548 --> 06:48:34.558 align:start position:0%
probably will result in uh higher
 
06:48:35.750 --> 06:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
private school tuitions and
 
06:48:35.760 --> 06:48:37.070 align:start position:0%
private school tuitions and
administration

06:48:37.070 --> 06:48:37.080 align:start position:0%
administration
 
06:48:39.670 --> 06:48:39.680 align:start position:0%
costs it would allow public funds to be
 
06:48:41.510 --> 06:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
expended on religious schools I realize
 
06:48:44.070 --> 06:48:44.080 align:start position:0%
that that has been mentioned before um
 
06:48:47.270 --> 06:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
but I would point out again that that
 
06:48:49.190 --> 06:48:49.200 align:start position:0%
discrimination could result in
 
06:48:50.910 --> 06:48:50.920 align:start position:0%
discrimination among religions for
 
06:48:53.788 --> 06:48:53.798 align:start position:0%
example uh there are multitude of
 
06:48:56.468 --> 06:48:56.478 align:start position:0%
religions in New Hampshire and largely
 
06:48:58.230 --> 06:48:58.240 align:start position:0%
for this reason New Hampshire has a long
 
06:48:59.670 --> 06:48:59.680 align:start position:0%
tradition of not funding religious
 
06:49:03.548 --> 06:49:03.558 align:start position:0%
schools nor I believe um is it allowed
 
06:49:05.030 --> 06:49:05.040 align:start position:0%
under our
 
06:49:07.830 --> 06:49:07.840 align:start position:0%
constitution not only is discrimination
 
06:49:09.670 --> 06:49:09.680 align:start position:0%
possible on the basis of religion for
 
06:49:11.350 --> 06:49:11.360 align:start position:0%
schools as a whole but it is certainly
 
06:49:14.350 --> 06:49:14.360 align:start position:0%
possible on the basis of individuals and
 
06:49:16.948 --> 06:49:16.958 align:start position:0%
this would be um an issue of possible
 
06:49:19.110 --> 06:49:19.120 align:start position:0%
discrimination not only from private
 
06:49:21.548 --> 06:49:21.558 align:start position:0%
organizations but also from the
 
06:49:23.468 --> 06:49:23.478 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization itself self
 
06:49:25.750 --> 06:49:25.760 align:start position:0%
again there is no public oversight and
 
06:49:28.750 --> 06:49:28.760 align:start position:0%
that in my mind is the key problem with
 
06:49:30.788 --> 06:49:30.798 align:start position:0%
this bill and for the for the record
 
06:49:32.070 --> 06:49:32.080 align:start position:0%
with uh
 
06:49:34.830 --> 06:49:34.840 align:start position:0%
hb20 I note that there is no Financial
 
06:49:37.388 --> 06:49:37.398 align:start position:0%
note attached as other people have said
 
06:49:38.990 --> 06:49:39.000 align:start position:0%
I do want to mention that uh
 
06:49:41.350 --> 06:49:41.360 align:start position:0%
representative Kirk who was a well-known
 
06:49:43.590 --> 06:49:43.600 align:start position:0%
fiscal conservative in the past did
 
06:49:46.628 --> 06:49:46.638 align:start position:0%
provide a a summary of a similar Bill a
 
06:49:50.150 --> 06:49:50.160 align:start position:0%
session or two ago and U his summary
 
06:49:52.310 --> 06:49:52.320 align:start position:0%
might be instructive to look at in the
 
06:49:54.628 --> 06:49:54.638 align:start position:0%
absence of a fiscal note which I
 
06:49:56.830 --> 06:49:56.840 align:start position:0%
certainly hope is forthcoming I would
 
06:49:59.468 --> 06:49:59.478 align:start position:0%
like to um thank you all again for your
 
06:50:01.590 --> 06:50:01.600 align:start position:0%
time and I appreciate the fact that you
 
06:50:03.990 --> 06:50:04.000 align:start position:0%
let me uh get in even though I ran in
 
06:50:05.910 --> 06:50:05.920 align:start position:0%
under the wire thank you very
 
06:50:08.990 --> 06:50:09.000 align:start position:0%
much thank you very much uh Mr St
 
06:50:12.070 --> 06:50:12.080 align:start position:0%
Martin uh with that we are going to
 
06:50:15.548 --> 06:50:15.558 align:start position:0%
close our session our hearing for
 
06:50:19.548 --> 06:50:19.558 align:start position:0%
today and it's uh it's uh right now
 
06:50:23.110 --> 06:50:23.120 align:start position:0%
about eight minutes or 4 uh we we had
 
06:50:26.230 --> 06:50:26.240 align:start position:0%
today actually presenting I count around
 
06:50:29.070 --> 06:50:29.080 align:start position:0%
16 or so
 
06:50:33.030 --> 06:50:33.040 align:start position:0%
um and we had 36 supporting it this is
 
06:50:35.788 --> 06:50:35.798 align:start position:0%
the sheets that we handed 36 supporting
 
06:50:40.750 --> 06:50:40.760 align:start position:0%
658 opposed two neutral and 16 uh
 
06:50:43.468 --> 06:50:43.478 align:start position:0%
supposedly testifying we got 16
 
06:50:44.990 --> 06:50:45.000 align:start position:0%
testifying I don't know if they're the
 
06:50:46.788 --> 06:50:46.798 align:start position:0%
same ones
 
06:50:52.510 --> 06:50:52.520 align:start position:0%
but seven added oppose and one added uh
 
06:50:52.520 --> 06:50:56.868 align:start position:0%
but seven added oppose and one added uh
support

06:50:56.868 --> 06:50:56.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:58.910 --> 06:50:58.920 align:start position:0%
two eight
 
06:51:01.910 --> 06:51:01.920 align:start position:0%

06:52:01.628 --> 06:52:01.638 align:start position:0%
that have been heard and we haven't
 
06:52:02.990 --> 06:52:03.000 align:start position:0%
dealt with
 
06:52:05.628 --> 06:52:05.638 align:start position:0%
already so with that this meeting is
 
06:52:07.670 --> 06:52:07.680 align:start position:0%
adjourned you have some questions you
 
06:52:12.190 --> 06:52:12.200 align:start position:0%
have some questions here wait I I did
 
06:52:14.350 --> 06:52:14.360 align:start position:0%
well for one thing is has representative
 
06:52:17.350 --> 06:52:17.360 align:start position:0%
veral become a member of our committee
 
06:52:19.910 --> 06:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
he's still
 
06:52:23.388 --> 06:52:23.398 align:start position:0%
here and and also if you remember I
 
06:52:25.590 --> 06:52:25.600 align:start position:0%
asked if you had any idea of what time
 
06:52:28.030 --> 06:52:28.040 align:start position:0%
we would be ending next Thursday because
 
06:52:30.190 --> 06:52:30.200 align:start position:0%
I do have my vaccine appointment at 5:
 
06:52:33.310 --> 06:52:33.320 align:start position:0%
so I have to leave by 4 you know do you
 
06:52:35.150 --> 06:52:35.160 align:start position:0%
think we will be done by four or should
 
06:52:36.468 --> 06:52:36.478 align:start position:0%
I get a
 
06:52:40.150 --> 06:52:40.160 align:start position:0%
sub I I can't give you a good answer in
 
06:52:42.430 --> 06:52:42.440 align:start position:0%
that representative Cornell um it
 
06:52:44.910 --> 06:52:44.920 align:start position:0%
depends upon the number of people that
 
06:52:49.270 --> 06:52:49.280 align:start position:0%
we we get this list the morning of um
 
06:52:53.270 --> 06:52:53.280 align:start position:0%
the the testimony for that bill so
 
06:52:54.990 --> 06:52:55.000 align:start position:0%
it's different than what we had from the
 
06:52:59.150 --> 06:52:59.160 align:start position:0%
previous day when we had on Thursday uh
 
06:53:01.910 --> 06:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
there the list is uh the goal posts are
 
06:53:05.548 --> 06:53:05.558 align:start position:0%
moving all over the field here so I I
 
06:53:07.070 --> 06:53:07.080 align:start position:0%
just can't give you that answer right
 
06:53:09.430 --> 06:53:09.440 align:start position:0%
now I'm hoping that we could have this
 
06:53:14.948 --> 06:53:14.958 align:start position:0%
done in the morning but um you know it's
 
06:53:16.628 --> 06:53:16.638 align:start position:0%
something where if you do have a
 
06:53:16.638 --> 06:53:18.070 align:start position:0%
something where if you do have a
doctor's

06:53:18.070 --> 06:53:18.080 align:start position:0%
doctor's
 
06:53:23.270 --> 06:53:23.280 align:start position:0%
appointment um and it's five at 5
 
06:53:26.070 --> 06:53:26.080 align:start position:0%
block yeah well I'd like to know the
 
06:53:28.750 --> 06:53:28.760 align:start position:0%
name of that doctor maybe I'd use him no
 
06:53:31.350 --> 06:53:31.360 align:start position:0%
it's to get my vaccine shot I'm getting
 
06:53:31.360 --> 06:53:32.670 align:start position:0%
it's to get my vaccine shot I'm getting

answer that Patricia I just uh I don't
 
06:53:45.750 --> 06:53:45.760 align:start position:0%
know but I would suggest that we will be
 
06:53:48.868 --> 06:53:48.878 align:start position:0%
done hopefully by that
 
06:53:48.878 --> 06:53:50.708 align:start position:0%
done hopefully by that
time

06:53:50.708 --> 06:53:50.718 align:start position:0%
time
 
06:53:53.310 --> 06:53:53.320 align:start position:0%
okay we won't be doing
 
06:53:56.070 --> 06:53:56.080 align:start position:0%
if we go that we'll be trying to get out
 
06:54:00.868 --> 06:54:00.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:04.590 --> 06:54:04.600 align:start position:0%

06:54:12.590 --> 06:54:12.600 align:start position:0%
air um I I do have some rough ideas
 
06:54:14.388 --> 06:54:14.398 align:start position:0%
that's something that's my homework for
 
06:54:16.788 --> 06:54:16.798 align:start position:0%
this evening um but I can give you what
 
06:54:19.150 --> 06:54:19.160 align:start position:0%

Ellison

06:54:20.708 --> 06:54:20.718 align:start position:0%
Ellison
 
06:54:29.230 --> 06:54:29.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:29.240 --> 06:54:35.750 align:start position:0%
 
here

06:54:35.750 --> 06:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:51.590 --> 06:54:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:51.600 --> 06:55:05.030 align:start position:0%
 
okay

06:55:05.030 --> 06:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:17.548 --> 06:55:17.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:19.708 --> 06:55:19.718 align:start position:0%
paperwork well Mr chairman tomorrow
 
06:55:21.230 --> 06:55:21.240 align:start position:0%
would be fine if you think that you
 
06:55:24.150 --> 06:55:24.160 align:start position:0%
might have more information at at that
 
06:55:26.750 --> 06:55:26.760 align:start position:0%
point yeah I I've got to get that in
 
06:55:29.590 --> 06:55:29.600 align:start position:0%
tomorrow I can tell you that we have
 
06:55:32.708 --> 06:55:32.718 align:start position:0%
several bills we've yet to
 
06:55:36.230 --> 06:55:36.240 align:start position:0%
address um the special education bill is
 
06:55:39.110 --> 06:55:39.120 align:start position:0%
one of them uh I I think that what was
 
06:55:42.750 --> 06:55:42.760 align:start position:0%
that 613 yes uh that's the bill where
 
06:55:44.270 --> 06:55:44.280 align:start position:0%
we're waiting for an amendment to come
 
06:55:47.670 --> 06:55:47.680 align:start position:0%
in where we can possibly uh address this
 
06:55:49.310 --> 06:55:49.320 align:start position:0%
catastrophic Aid the special ed
 
06:55:50.750 --> 06:55:50.760 align:start position:0%
component that's on that bill is
 
06:55:53.830 --> 06:55:53.840 align:start position:0%
catastrophic Aid and we're looking at a
 
06:55:56.628 --> 06:55:56.638 align:start position:0%
possibility of trying to get that um
 
06:55:59.310 --> 06:55:59.320 align:start position:0%
Insurance Pool to try to help districts
 
06:56:01.628 --> 06:56:01.638 align:start position:0%
dealing with the extravagant costs
 
06:56:03.230 --> 06:56:03.240 align:start position:0%
associated with that
 
06:56:03.240 --> 06:56:05.468 align:start position:0%
associated with that
program

06:56:05.468 --> 06:56:05.478 align:start position:0%
program
 
06:56:09.910 --> 06:56:09.920 align:start position:0%
um and let's see we have uh
 
06:56:13.468 --> 06:56:13.478 align:start position:0%
608 deal with that's the uh the bill
 
06:56:15.030 --> 06:56:15.040 align:start position:0%
that's relative to the formula for
 
06:56:17.948 --> 06:56:17.958 align:start position:0%
determining funding for Education yeah
 
06:56:20.070 --> 06:56:20.080 align:start position:0%
and there's been a couple bills that we
 
06:56:23.430 --> 06:56:23.440 align:start position:0%
have not addressed to this point um um
 
06:56:26.310 --> 06:56:26.320 align:start position:0%
so I I would suggest that and of course
 
06:56:28.230 --> 06:56:28.240 align:start position:0%
then we're going to have to have
 
06:56:31.190 --> 06:56:31.200 align:start position:0%
executive sessions on both hb2 along the
 
06:56:33.750 --> 06:56:33.760 align:start position:0%
lines and the bill we just did
 
06:56:33.760 --> 06:56:35.310 align:start position:0%
lines and the bill we just did
today

06:56:35.310 --> 06:56:35.320 align:start position:0%
today
 
06:56:39.150 --> 06:56:39.160 align:start position:0%
so so and 110 has to come up that's the
 
06:56:43.468 --> 06:56:43.478 align:start position:0%
bill that deals with the money from the
 
06:56:45.948 --> 06:56:45.958 align:start position:0%
uh the doe the quarterly payments going
 
06:56:47.830 --> 06:56:47.840 align:start position:0%
to municipality rather than the school
 
06:56:50.708 --> 06:56:50.718 align:start position:0%
district or the district uh we have to
 
06:56:56.430 --> 06:56:56.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:56:58.990 --> 06:56:59.000 align:start position:0%
oh and and here's exactly and I I do
 
06:57:00.670 --> 06:57:00.680 align:start position:0%
have this draft sheet here in Fr me now
 
06:57:01.750 --> 06:57:01.760 align:start position:0%
so on
 
06:57:04.948 --> 06:57:04.958 align:start position:0%
Thursday we're dealing with hb20 as you
 
06:57:07.868 --> 06:57:07.878 align:start position:0%
you all probably know when we we recess
 
06:57:10.788 --> 06:57:10.798 align:start position:0%
that bill Tuesday the following week
 
06:57:12.510 --> 06:57:12.520 align:start position:0%
we'll have an executive session starting
 
06:57:15.990 --> 06:57:16.000 align:start position:0%
out with 613 that's the special ed bill
 
06:57:17.548 --> 06:57:17.558 align:start position:0%
then we're going to have a hearing
 
06:57:20.990 --> 06:57:21.000 align:start position:0%
somewhere along the way on
 
06:57:25.030 --> 06:57:25.040 align:start position:0%
608 and we're going to try to get
 
06:57:30.030 --> 06:57:30.040 align:start position:0%
608 um through EXA session and hb2 if
 
06:57:33.468 --> 06:57:33.478 align:start position:0%
we're you know ready for it or if if
 
06:57:35.468 --> 06:57:35.478 align:start position:0%
we've got the hearing done hopefully we
 
06:57:37.670 --> 06:57:37.680 align:start position:0%
do uh then on
 
06:57:40.750 --> 06:57:40.760 align:start position:0%
Thursday that's the 18th that's the day
 
06:57:42.708 --> 06:57:42.718 align:start position:0%
we have to have everything reported by
 
06:57:46.388 --> 06:57:46.398 align:start position:0%
that's an early Bill we'd still have
 
06:57:49.270 --> 06:57:49.280 align:start position:0%
607 and then we have another bill 320
 
06:57:51.628 --> 06:57:51.638 align:start position:0%
which is the Civics test requirement so
 
06:57:54.310 --> 06:57:54.320 align:start position:0%
and and some those which we haven't done
 
06:57:55.990 --> 06:57:56.000 align:start position:0%
are not early bills so we're not going
 
06:57:57.590 --> 06:57:57.600 align:start position:0%
to be put to the wall to get those
 
06:58:01.670 --> 06:58:01.680 align:start position:0%
things done we can hold those over so
 
06:58:04.270 --> 06:58:04.280 align:start position:0%
um it looks like most of the hard work's
 
06:58:06.110 --> 06:58:06.120 align:start position:0%
going to be done on that Tuesday of the
 
06:58:08.708 --> 06:58:08.718 align:start position:0%
next week and at least the morning there
 
06:58:10.628 --> 06:58:10.638 align:start position:0%

06:59:09.388 --> 06:59:09.398 align:start position:0%
testify I'm going to let that person uh
 
06:59:13.030 --> 06:59:13.040 align:start position:0%
testify okay thank thank you Mr chair Mr
 
06:59:15.310 --> 06:59:15.320 align:start position:0%
Mr chair on 20 where we have a
 
06:59:16.990 --> 06:59:17.000 align:start position:0%
two-minute rule I tried to impose
 
06:59:18.310 --> 06:59:18.320 align:start position:0%
something and we gave the three minutes
 
06:59:20.430 --> 06:59:20.440 align:start position:0%
today but some people went over by a
 
06:59:23.388 --> 06:59:23.398 align:start position:0%
minute or so they closing their their
 
06:59:27.110 --> 06:59:27.120 align:start position:0%
presentations down Mr chair yes I I
 
06:59:30.868 --> 06:59:30.878 align:start position:0%
would like to know um when we're you
 
06:59:32.788 --> 06:59:32.798 align:start position:0%
expect that we will get fiscal notes on
 
06:59:35.788 --> 06:59:35.798 align:start position:0%
some of these things I know that um as
 
06:59:37.788 --> 06:59:37.798 align:start position:0%
people have testified you know it's hard
 
06:59:41.548 --> 06:59:41.558 align:start position:0%
to make any specific number but
 
06:59:44.110 --> 06:59:44.120 align:start position:0%
certainly in the past the LBA and the
 
06:59:47.590 --> 06:59:47.600 align:start position:0%
doe has made fiscal notes based on
 
06:59:50.388 --> 06:59:50.398 align:start position:0%
estimates um and also on statistics from
 
06:59:52.430 --> 06:59:52.440 align:start position:0%
other states that have Incorporated uh
 
06:59:54.990 --> 06:59:55.000 align:start position:0%
similar thing to see what percentage of
 
06:59:58.990 --> 06:59:59.000 align:start position:0%
students um actually are en enrolled in
 
07:00:02.468 --> 07:00:02.478 align:start position:0%
um these programs so I have a hard time
 
07:00:04.788 --> 07:00:04.798 align:start position:0%
voting on these when I don't know what
 
07:00:06.388 --> 07:00:06.398 align:start position:0%
it's how it's going to affect my local
 
07:00:08.190 --> 07:00:08.200 align:start position:0%
school district in terms of money I
 
07:00:10.670 --> 07:00:10.680 align:start position:0%
don't know how it's going to affect the
 
07:00:14.548 --> 07:00:14.558 align:start position:0%
local taxpayers so um could you put some
 
07:00:16.150 --> 07:00:16.160 align:start position:0%
pressure on to see if we can get some
 
07:00:18.910 --> 07:00:18.920 align:start position:0%
fiscal notes yeah
 
07:00:21.548 --> 07:00:21.558 align:start position:0%
I I've been trying to put that pressure
 
07:00:23.990 --> 07:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
on at it's just this compressed schedule
 
07:00:26.868 --> 07:00:26.878 align:start position:0%
that we've been within uh that there are
 
07:00:29.990 --> 07:00:30.000 align:start position:0%
number bills which we had more you know
 
07:00:32.230 --> 07:00:32.240 align:start position:0%
of these early bills that had fiscal
 
07:00:35.430 --> 07:00:35.440 align:start position:0%
notes or needed fiscal notes and the
 
07:00:38.590 --> 07:00:38.600 align:start position:0%
department is receiving this stuff and I
 
07:00:40.788 --> 07:00:40.798 align:start position:0%
can honestly say and I've seen that
 
07:00:42.468 --> 07:00:42.478 align:start position:0%
people like Caitlyn are over there just
 
07:00:44.350 --> 07:00:44.360 align:start position:0%
you know trying and and and Mark is
 
07:00:46.510 --> 07:00:46.520 align:start position:0%
working with her trying to get this
 
07:00:49.590 --> 07:00:49.600 align:start position:0%
stuff pushed out um in fact some of the
 
07:00:51.548 --> 07:00:51.558 align:start position:0%
stuff still has to come from there Co to
 
07:00:55.830 --> 07:00:55.840 align:start position:0%
the lb hey and and uh some of these
 
07:00:58.830 --> 07:00:58.840 align:start position:0%
bills have not even arrived there yet uh
 
07:01:01.468 --> 07:01:01.478 align:start position:0%
so it's it's one I've had the question
 
07:01:05.868 --> 07:01:05.878 align:start position:0%
to and I recognize that um uh in some
 
07:01:08.070 --> 07:01:08.080 align:start position:0%
cases we may be just dealing with the
 
07:01:10.510 --> 07:01:10.520 align:start position:0%
policy side like we're trying to do in
 
07:01:12.590 --> 07:01:12.600 align:start position:0%
the school building Aid right now the
 
07:01:14.708 --> 07:01:14.718 align:start position:0%
policy side and then the fiscal stuff
 
07:01:16.190 --> 07:01:16.200 align:start position:0%
that's going to have to be taken care of
 
07:01:18.708 --> 07:01:18.718 align:start position:0%
in the next committee when when we do
 
07:01:21.468 --> 07:01:21.478 align:start position:0%
have more accurate uh information it's
 
07:01:23.990 --> 07:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
also like we have in the house when we
 
07:01:25.670 --> 07:01:25.680 align:start position:0%
don't have all the quarterly reports
 
07:01:27.310 --> 07:01:27.320 align:start position:0%
back and we're looking at our revenues
 
07:01:28.468 --> 07:01:28.478 align:start position:0%
and then all of a sudden it goes to the
 
07:01:30.030 --> 07:01:30.040 align:start position:0%
Senate and of course they have that
 
07:01:31.910 --> 07:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
information and everything gets updated
 
07:01:35.110 --> 07:01:35.120 align:start position:0%
a little bit over there so I will again
 
07:01:37.670 --> 07:01:37.680 align:start position:0%
make some contacts to see and try to
 
07:01:41.030 --> 07:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
move them along but quite honestly uh
 
07:01:43.270 --> 07:01:43.280 align:start position:0%
they're underwater and this remote
 
07:01:46.670 --> 07:01:46.680 align:start position:0%
situation isn't helping matters at all
 
07:01:48.628 --> 07:01:48.638 align:start position:0%
well thank you I just um I really have a
 
07:01:50.670 --> 07:01:50.680 align:start position:0%
hard time with that I I've never you
 
07:01:52.990 --> 07:01:53.000 align:start position:0%
know in the three four turn now that
 
07:01:54.990 --> 07:01:55.000 align:start position:0%
I've been here I've never had an
 
07:01:57.430 --> 07:01:57.440 align:start position:0%
instance I think that I haven't been
 
07:01:59.388 --> 07:01:59.398 align:start position:0%
able to at least have an estimate of
 
07:02:02.030 --> 07:02:02.040 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact on my local
 
07:02:04.670 --> 07:02:04.680 align:start position:0%
communities yeah thank you for for
 
07:02:08.030 --> 07:02:08.040 align:start position:0%
pushing it so without if there are there
 
07:02:10.548 --> 07:02:10.558 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee not
 
07:02:12.430 --> 07:02:12.440 align:start position:0%
see any thank you very much everybody
 
07:02:15.110 --> 07:02:15.120 align:start position:0%
and have a good evening and uh we'll see
 
07:02:18.230 --> 07:02:18.240 align:start position:0%
