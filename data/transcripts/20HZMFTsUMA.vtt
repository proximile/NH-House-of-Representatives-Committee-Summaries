uh i'll call it one o'clock and um one
 
00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 align:start position:0%
o'clock uh i'm going to convene
 
00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 align:start position:0%
this session on
 
00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 align:start position:0%
house bill 103 uh we've had some
 
00:01:59.429 --> 00:01:59.439 align:start position:0%
amendments to it
 
00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:02.799 align:start position:0%
um i'll start by asking mr ripple uh if
 
00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 align:start position:0%
the very last minute
 
00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
changes i i was asking for were able to
 
00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 align:start position:0%
but we have the amendment that was
 
00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:16.879 align:start position:0%
drafted yesterday along with your
 
00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 align:start position:0%
okay so so i'll i'll talk a little bit
 
00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 align:start position:0%
about um the context of what we're
 
00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 align:start position:0%
what's happened since our last hearing
 
00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:37.599 align:start position:0%
and then um and then we'll bring the
 
00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 align:start position:0%
department forward we'll probably just
 
00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 align:start position:0%
have a few questions just to
 
00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 align:start position:0%
close things out but
 
00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:45.670 align:start position:0%
close things out but
uh

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:48.319 align:start position:0%
so we're really really close i i ended
 
00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:49.350 align:start position:0%
so we're really really close i i ended
up

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 align:start position:0%
talking to the senate about
 
00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 align:start position:0%
senate bill 422 and by the saying the
 
00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 align:start position:0%
senate i actually mean five different
 
00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.630 align:start position:0%
senate i actually mean five different
senators

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 align:start position:0%
senators
 
00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 align:start position:0%
to include the prime sponsor
 
00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.229 align:start position:0%
to include the prime sponsor
and

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:03.599 align:start position:0%
i explained
 
00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
to the prime sponsor
 
00:03:11.589 --> 00:03:11.599 align:start position:0%
that in my perception 422 and 103 were
 
00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:14.239 align:start position:0%
extremely similar to one another but
 
00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 align:start position:0%
that 103
 
00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 align:start position:0%
had reigned back
 
00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 align:start position:0%
um some of what 422 wanted
 
00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:24.319 align:start position:0%
in terms of uh our
 
00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 align:start position:0%
asking for
 
00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 align:start position:0%
uh patients to pay a co-pay when they
 
00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 align:start position:0%
were able to
 
00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 align:start position:0%
and also to carve out the particular
 
00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.070 align:start position:0%
and also to carve out the particular
um

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:36.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 align:start position:0%
patient population demographics that
 
00:03:41.589 --> 00:03:41.599 align:start position:0%
would be subject to receiving uh
 
00:03:44.869 --> 00:03:44.879 align:start position:0%
dentures the fort 422 the senate version
 
00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:45.910 align:start position:0%
dentures the fort 422 the senate version
was

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 align:start position:0%
open to every beneficiary and they had
 
00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 align:start position:0%
no co-pays
 
00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.990 align:start position:0%
no co-pays
we

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:54.640 align:start position:0%
uh liked their fifteen hundred dollar
 
00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 align:start position:0%
annual cap so we took it in our
 
00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 align:start position:0%
amendment and we also liked their use of
 
00:04:01.589 --> 00:04:01.599 align:start position:0%
the centene funds
 
00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 align:start position:0%
that we used
 
00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 align:start position:0%
in our version
 
00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 align:start position:0%
the distinction in the centene
 
00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 align:start position:0%
settlement funds and our version is that
 
00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:14.949 align:start position:0%
settlement funds and our version is that
there

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:14.959 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 align:start position:0%
mr ripple would you would you remind me
 
00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 align:start position:0%
of the the term for the 2.4 million
 
00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:22.479 align:start position:0%
dollars that there was something about a
 
00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:24.639 align:start position:0%
risk corridor right there was 2.4
 
00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 align:start position:0%
million dollars for a risk corridor
 
00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 align:start position:0%
settlement which the department would be
 
00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 align:start position:0%
able to explain in better detail than i
 
00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:31.600 align:start position:0%
can but it was basically for
 
00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 align:start position:0%
uh overpayments
 
00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 align:start position:0%
that the federal government made because
 
00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:37.749 align:start position:0%
that the federal government made because
of

00:04:37.749 --> 00:04:37.759 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:38.710 align:start position:0%
of
uh

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:38.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:40.880 align:start position:0%
flawed pricing methodology on the part
 
00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 align:start position:0%
of centene that the state now owes back
 
00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:45.199 align:start position:0%
to the federal government
 
00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 align:start position:0%
okay so thank you for that so so since
 
00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:51.040 align:start position:0%
uh we had no hearings in the house on
 
00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.280 align:start position:0%
the risk corridor issue
 
00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:54.710 align:start position:0%
the risk corridor issue
we

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 align:start position:0%
took that we excised that from 103
 
00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:00.880 align:start position:0%
and we reduced the amount of the
 
00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:02.880 align:start position:0%
settlement we would lay claim to by the
 
00:05:05.749 --> 00:05:05.759 align:start position:0%
2.4 million dollars that way the risk
 
00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:08.639 align:start position:0%
corridor issue can stand on its own
 
00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.280 align:start position:0%
and maybe maybe what could happen is sb
 
00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.080 align:start position:0%
422 would would get amended down to
 
00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:16.639 align:start position:0%
where it was just a risk corridor bill
 
00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:18.320 align:start position:0%
you know potentially
 
00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.120 align:start position:0%
so uh so that that that those
 
00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:22.800 align:start position:0%
discussions were held with the prime
 
00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:25.600 align:start position:0%
sponsor and several co-sponsors
 
00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:28.560 align:start position:0%
and i and i think generally um
 
00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:29.840 align:start position:0%
the the
 
00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:32.320 align:start position:0%
i could expect the senate to support hb
 
00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:34.960 align:start position:0%
103. we'll see how that all plays out
 
00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:36.240 align:start position:0%
but that that would be my
 
00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:39.029 align:start position:0%
but that that would be my
prognostication

00:05:39.029 --> 00:05:39.039 align:start position:0%
prognostication
 
00:05:41.749 --> 00:05:41.759 align:start position:0%
as i was going through the amendment
 
00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:43.600 align:start position:0%
that um
 
00:05:46.629 --> 00:05:46.639 align:start position:0%
mr ripple had prepared on our behalf um
 
00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:49.919 align:start position:0%
the edwards irf amendment uh
 
00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.590 align:start position:0%
 
hotel

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:55.600 align:start position:0%
hotel
 
00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.189 align:start position:0%
hotel
um

00:05:57.189 --> 00:05:57.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:57.199 --> 00:05:58.150 align:start position:0%
um
i

00:05:58.150 --> 00:05:58.160 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:00.080 align:start position:0%
i reread it and
 
00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:02.000 align:start position:0%
what seemed to me to be missing that i
 
00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:04.960 align:start position:0%
had never really noticed before
 
00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:08.720 align:start position:0%
was there there was no discussion in the
 
00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:10.400 align:start position:0%
statement of purpose
 
00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:13.280 align:start position:0%
about the importance and the primacy
 
00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:15.440 align:start position:0%
of individual responsibility to take
 
00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
care of their own oral health
 
00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:19.430 align:start position:0%
care of their own oral health
so

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:06:22.629 --> 00:06:22.639 align:start position:0%
mr ripple has gone down to ols
 
00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:24.880 align:start position:0%
very late in the game because i was very
 
00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:27.120 align:start position:0%
late in the process
 
00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:32.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:35.120 align:start position:0%
we would add
 
00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:36.880 align:start position:0%
that in addition the general court
 
00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:39.280 align:start position:0%
recognizes that personal responsibility
 
00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
is an essential component of any
 
00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
strategy to improve individuals oral
 
00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.309 align:start position:0%
strategy to improve individuals oral
health

00:06:46.309 --> 00:06:46.319 align:start position:0%
health
 
00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:48.880 align:start position:0%
without that statement you can almost
 
00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:50.070 align:start position:0%
without that statement you can almost
imply

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:50.080 align:start position:0%
imply
 
00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:52.720 align:start position:0%
that it's the state's responsibility to
 
00:06:54.629 --> 00:06:54.639 align:start position:0%
take care of people's oral health
 
00:06:56.629 --> 00:06:56.639 align:start position:0%
without acknowledging
 
00:06:58.230 --> 00:06:58.240 align:start position:0%
that first and foremost it's an
 
00:07:00.629 --> 00:07:00.639 align:start position:0%
individual responsibility so i i don't
 
00:07:04.469 --> 00:07:04.479 align:start position:0%
think this is a controversial addition
 
00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:07.280 align:start position:0%
i just think that it it tells a fuller
 
00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:08.309 align:start position:0%
i just think that it it tells a fuller
story

00:07:08.309 --> 00:07:08.319 align:start position:0%
story
 
00:07:11.189 --> 00:07:11.199 align:start position:0%
and for anyone wanting to compare 422
 
00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:13.440 align:start position:0%
and 108
 
00:07:16.469 --> 00:07:16.479 align:start position:0%
this sentence could help them understand
 
00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
that the house version is placing
 
00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:22.720 align:start position:0%
relatively slightly more emphasis
 
00:07:24.629 --> 00:07:24.639 align:start position:0%
on the personal responsibility of
 
00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
individuals to care for their own oral
 
00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:28.880 align:start position:0%
health there were a couple other
 
00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:31.520 align:start position:0%
minor edits
 
00:07:35.029 --> 00:07:35.039 align:start position:0%

00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:41.589 --> 00:07:41.599 align:start position:0%
we added
 
00:07:44.469 --> 00:07:44.479 align:start position:0%
in the existing list of goals the goal
 
00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:46.720 align:start position:0%
of fostering individual behaviors that
 
00:07:50.869 --> 00:07:50.879 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:56.830 --> 00:07:56.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:58.469 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:07:58.469 --> 00:07:58.479 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
we added to the list of states needs
 
00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:04.560 align:start position:0%
patient education
 
00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
on page two
 
00:08:09.029 --> 00:08:09.039 align:start position:0%
line four
 
00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:13.440 align:start position:0%
we again similar added patient education
 
00:08:14.869 --> 00:08:14.879 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:08:18.309 --> 00:08:18.319 align:start position:0%
i i think this actually just
 
00:08:20.629 --> 00:08:20.639 align:start position:0%
completes and rounds the circle
 
00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:24.800 align:start position:0%
because we already had included in
 
00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:27.840 align:start position:0%
the the specific deliverables of the
 
00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:29.350 align:start position:0%
the the specific deliverables of the
contractors

00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:29.360 align:start position:0%
contractors
 
00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:32.800 align:start position:0%
the fact that they needed to um
 
00:08:35.589 --> 00:08:35.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:39.440 align:start position:0%
that on line 26 of page two it says that
 
00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:42.320 align:start position:0%
they were to conduct behavior management
 
00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
and smoking cessation counseling so so
 
00:08:47.509 --> 00:08:47.519 align:start position:0%
we had already anticipated the need for
 
00:08:50.389 --> 00:08:50.399 align:start position:0%
patient education to be in it this this
 
00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:52.160 align:start position:0%
just makes sure that the framework
 
00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:53.350 align:start position:0%
just makes sure that the framework
supports

00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:53.360 align:start position:0%
supports
 
00:08:56.230 --> 00:08:56.240 align:start position:0%
the specific thing that we asked for
 
00:08:57.829 --> 00:08:57.839 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:08:59.750 --> 00:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
so i i don't think those are
 
00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:02.240 align:start position:0%
controversial additions they're just not
 
00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:05.440 align:start position:0%
in the amendment that we have before us
 
00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:06.800 align:start position:0%
is is there
 
00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
is there any discussion on that i i'm
 
00:09:11.509 --> 00:09:11.519 align:start position:0%
hoping everyone at least has mr ripple's
 
00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:17.920 align:start position:0%
and we're able to follow along
 
00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:19.269 align:start position:0%
and we're able to follow along
is

00:09:19.269 --> 00:09:19.279 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:09:21.829 --> 00:09:21.839 align:start position:0%
is there any discussion by the committee
 
00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:24.160 align:start position:0%
because what i'd what i'd like to do is
 
00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:27.360 align:start position:0%
is get through hb 103
 
00:09:29.829 --> 00:09:29.839 align:start position:0%
and then recess us because we're going
 
00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:32.920 align:start position:0%
to have a long session on hb
 
00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:36.320 align:start position:0%
1677 and hope that ols can complete the
 
00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:38.800 align:start position:0%
work and then we can just vote on
 
00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:40.800 align:start position:0%
the the latest amendment uh this
 
00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:42.240 align:start position:0%
afternoon that's that's what i'm
 
00:09:43.829 --> 00:09:43.839 align:start position:0%
thinking we'll do
 
00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:45.760 align:start position:0%
uh representative rogers representative
 
00:09:48.389 --> 00:09:48.399 align:start position:0%
walner do you have any
 
00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:50.480 align:start position:0%
yes representative walner and you need
 
00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:56.560 align:start position:0%
um i just wondered i assume that you we
 
00:09:58.470 --> 00:09:58.480 align:start position:0%
have run this all by mr littman to be
 
00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:01.760 align:start position:0%
sure that this works for the department
 
00:10:05.269 --> 00:10:05.279 align:start position:0%
and in his contracting it works
 
00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:07.680 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to go with a partial yes on
 
00:10:09.509 --> 00:10:09.519 align:start position:0%
that and then i'll explain the partial
 
00:10:13.509 --> 00:10:13.519 align:start position:0%
yes is that that he's he's seen
 
00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:16.880 align:start position:0%
uh the amendment and so has dr finney
 
00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:19.120 align:start position:0%
seen the amendment zero eight six eight
 
00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
hotel and and they've
 
00:10:23.509 --> 00:10:23.519 align:start position:0%
i've gotten word
 
00:10:25.509 --> 00:10:25.519 align:start position:0%
through i think mr shapiro that you got
 
00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
a representative shapiro that you guys
 
00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:28.720 align:start position:0%
were good with at
 
00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:30.880 align:start position:0%
the the the new new thing that's a
 
00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:33.200 align:start position:0%
little bit of a surprise to you
 
00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:37.680 align:start position:0%
is the new language i had added about
 
00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
including personal responsibility for
 
00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:41.680 align:start position:0%
your oral health and as i was reading
 
00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:43.120 align:start position:0%
and i was watching
 
00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:45.200 align:start position:0%
your body language seem to be saying yes
 
00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
but i don't want to assume too much
 
00:10:49.269 --> 00:10:49.279 align:start position:0%
so do you want to come up to the and
 
00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:04.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:05.920 align:start position:0%
good afternoon for the record henry
 
00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:08.320 align:start position:0%

00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
changes here these words he did um
 
00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
i i know it's a little um
 
00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:28.630 align:start position:0%
i i know it's a little um
quick

00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:28.640 align:start position:0%
quick
 
00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:29.430 align:start position:0%
quick
but

00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:29.440 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:31.600 align:start position:0%
do you have do you on its surface do you
 
00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
have any issue with adding these this
 
00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:35.030 align:start position:0%
have any issue with adding these this
terminology

00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
terminology
 
00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:37.200 align:start position:0%
none i think it just
 
00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:40.000 align:start position:0%
solidifies as you explained um all the
 
00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
way through
 
00:11:42.949 --> 00:11:42.959 align:start position:0%
what the intent is and
 
00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
i think we can work with it for sure
 
00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:47.120 align:start position:0%
do you follow
 
00:11:51.829 --> 00:11:51.839 align:start position:0%
no no thank you okay thank you are there
 
00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:53.680 align:start position:0%
any other questions i i just want to
 
00:11:55.829 --> 00:11:55.839 align:start position:0%
keep it focused for now on the
 
00:11:58.310 --> 00:11:58.320 align:start position:0%
additional supplement i i would add to
 
00:12:00.389 --> 00:12:00.399 align:start position:0%
the language on individual
 
00:12:00.399 --> 00:12:03.670 align:start position:0%
the language on individual
responsibility

00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:03.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:06.160 align:start position:0%
okay so so seeing none
 
00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:08.710 align:start position:0%
okay so so seeing none
um

00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:08.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:10.880 align:start position:0%
we can we can get into
 
00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:13.120 align:start position:0%
the amendment itself
 
00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:15.200 align:start position:0%
and i think we we did a pretty good
 
00:12:18.069 --> 00:12:18.079 align:start position:0%
review and that um
 
00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:21.760 align:start position:0%
what the changes are from last session
 
00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:24.480 align:start position:0%
uh is is the addition of the comments
 
00:12:26.629 --> 00:12:26.639 align:start position:0%
that that we made during that session
 
00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:29.360 align:start position:0%
like we included the centene settlement
 
00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:32.160 align:start position:0%
for example uh we included the fifteen
 
00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:34.880 align:start position:0%
hundred dollar ceiling right
 
00:12:36.829 --> 00:12:36.839 align:start position:0%
uh pardon
 
00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:40.240 align:start position:0%
me the 1500 was already in there
 
00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:42.240 align:start position:0%
oh all these added was the centene the
 
00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:43.360 align:start position:0%
appropriate you change the
 
00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:45.110 align:start position:0%
appropriate you change the
appropriations

00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:45.120 align:start position:0%
appropriations
 
00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:47.440 align:start position:0%
part to reference a corporation the
 
00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:49.360 align:start position:0%
centene settlement rather than just an
 
00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
absolute dollar amount that's okay so
 
00:12:55.190 --> 00:12:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:57.110 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:13:01.509 --> 00:13:01.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:06.160 align:start position:0%
lines six through eight
 
00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:07.110 align:start position:0%
lines six through eight
and

00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:07.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:13:09.829 --> 00:13:09.839 align:start position:0%
i i want to touch on something that dr
 
00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:12.560 align:start position:0%
finney shared with us in testimony last
 
00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:14.310 align:start position:0%
finney shared with us in testimony last
week

00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:14.320 align:start position:0%
week
 
00:13:15.509 --> 00:13:15.519 align:start position:0%
last week
 
00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:17.680 align:start position:0%
you mentioned a specific number you said
 
00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:20.240 align:start position:0%
that anyone that was over a hundred
 
00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:21.350 align:start position:0%
that anyone that was over a hundred
percent

00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:13:23.829 --> 00:13:23.839 align:start position:0%
uh poverty level would would pay ten
 
00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:26.320 align:start position:0%
percent of the bill
 
00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:28.880 align:start position:0%
all right so so just as i'm reading
 
00:13:31.509 --> 00:13:31.519 align:start position:0%
lines six through eight i don't see
 
00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
ten percent called out as an as a number
 
00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
and and so i would just want to hear you
 
00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
explain how
 
00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:48.560 align:start position:0%
in in line six um you have to the
 
00:13:51.509 --> 00:13:51.519 align:start position:0%
maximum extent allowed under cms
 
00:13:51.519 --> 00:13:52.710 align:start position:0%
maximum extent allowed under cms
guidelines

00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:52.720 align:start position:0%
guidelines
 
00:13:55.829 --> 00:13:55.839 align:start position:0%
and that is currently the maximum
 
00:13:57.590 --> 00:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
allowed and obviously
 
00:13:59.750 --> 00:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
if we have to follow
 
00:14:02.389 --> 00:14:02.399 align:start position:0%
the statute there we would
 
00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
we would if it increased or decreased we
 
00:14:06.389 --> 00:14:06.399 align:start position:0%
would have to follow that but it's been
 
00:14:09.189 --> 00:14:09.199 align:start position:0%
consistent for for a long time
 
00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:10.880 align:start position:0%
it hasn't changed and i don't i'm not
 
00:14:13.509 --> 00:14:13.519 align:start position:0%
aware of any changes in the offing
 
00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:15.680 align:start position:0%
all right i assume that but i didn't
 
00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
want to assume it so then the other
 
00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:20.720 align:start position:0%
thing i had a question from the other
 
00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:22.470 align:start position:0%
thing i had a question from the other
chamber

00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:22.480 align:start position:0%
chamber
 
00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:24.470 align:start position:0%
chamber
about

00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:14:26.949 --> 00:14:26.959 align:start position:0%
annual renewals and and i believe dr
 
00:14:26.959 --> 00:14:27.910 align:start position:0%
annual renewals and and i believe dr
finney

00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
finney
 
00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
said this in testimony last week but
 
00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:32.480 align:start position:0%
because i was asked by a senator i just
 
00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
what the process would be as i
 
00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
understand it is that
 
00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:45.920 align:start position:0%
incomes would be certified annually
 
00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:48.320 align:start position:0%
and that we wouldn't go back for
 
00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:50.629 align:start position:0%
and that we wouldn't go back for
recertification

00:14:50.629 --> 00:14:50.639 align:start position:0%
recertification
 
00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:52.480 align:start position:0%
until the next year
 
00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:54.160 align:start position:0%
so that if there were a change of
 
00:14:57.030 --> 00:14:57.040 align:start position:0%
incomes in in mid-season
 
00:14:59.189 --> 00:14:59.199 align:start position:0%
they would continue to
 
00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:00.560 align:start position:0%
pay out
 
00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
uh under
 
00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:04.880 align:start position:0%
their previous um
 
00:15:09.269 --> 00:15:09.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:10.949 --> 00:15:10.959 align:start position:0%
go ahead because you know if i could
 
00:15:12.949 --> 00:15:12.959 align:start position:0%
take that one if it's okay
 
00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
so um individuals are supposed to
 
00:15:18.629 --> 00:15:18.639 align:start position:0%
report changes in
 
00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:21.680 align:start position:0%
circumstance which would include income
 
00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:22.550 align:start position:0%
circumstance which would include income
so

00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:24.720 align:start position:0%
for example someone could
 
00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:26.480 align:start position:0%
who wasn't employed might get a job and
 
00:15:27.829 --> 00:15:27.839 align:start position:0%
that would change their income and
 
00:15:30.069 --> 00:15:30.079 align:start position:0%
potentially their eligibility the other
 
00:15:31.590 --> 00:15:31.600 align:start position:0%
way around could also happen someone
 
00:15:35.509 --> 00:15:35.519 align:start position:0%
could lose a job and their income would
 
00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:36.800 align:start position:0%
go down
 
00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:38.240 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:15:41.509 --> 00:15:41.519 align:start position:0%
it is generally um and most
 
00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:43.680 align:start position:0%
frequently an annual redetermination but
 
00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:45.680 align:start position:0%
there are can be changes for changes in
 
00:15:47.189 --> 00:15:47.199 align:start position:0%
circumstance and
 
00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:48.720 align:start position:0%
um it could be
 
00:15:50.629 --> 00:15:50.639 align:start position:0%
someone um
 
00:15:52.310 --> 00:15:52.320 align:start position:0%
had a medical condition that changed
 
00:15:54.310 --> 00:15:54.320 align:start position:0%
their circumstance so they've went into
 
00:15:56.470 --> 00:15:56.480 align:start position:0%
a different eligibility group
 
00:15:57.910 --> 00:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
they could age
 
00:15:57.920 --> 00:15:58.870 align:start position:0%
they could age
like

00:15:58.870 --> 00:15:58.880 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:01.040 align:start position:0%
someone who was a child who's now aging
 
00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:03.040 align:start position:0%
into the adult
 
00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:04.480 align:start position:0%
you know in an in-between period that
 
00:16:08.069 --> 00:16:08.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:11.509 --> 00:16:11.519 align:start position:0%
okay so so you actually uh cleared up my
 
00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:16.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:18.069 --> 00:16:18.079 align:start position:0%
but for the people
 
00:16:20.389 --> 00:16:20.399 align:start position:0%
at the reception desk who are trying to
 
00:16:23.110 --> 00:16:23.120 align:start position:0%
collect the money the answer remains the
 
00:16:25.509 --> 00:16:25.519 align:start position:0%
same to them when the patient comes in
 
00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:28.160 align:start position:0%
to visit they check the system to check
 
00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:30.240 align:start position:0%
the status and then
 
00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
act according to the status in the
 
00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.030 align:start position:0%
act according to the status in the
system

00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:33.040 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:16:35.269 --> 00:16:35.279 align:start position:0%
yes so all of the
 
00:16:38.310 --> 00:16:38.320 align:start position:0%
changes and you know
 
00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:41.360 align:start position:0%
their medicaid enrollment status
 
00:16:43.509 --> 00:16:43.519 align:start position:0%
are you know basically transparent to
 
00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:45.360 align:start position:0%
the providers it's just what the
 
00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:48.000 align:start position:0%
department does in background
 
00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
yes okay
 
00:16:50.629 --> 00:16:50.639 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:16:52.069 --> 00:16:52.079 align:start position:0%
um so that
 
00:16:52.079 --> 00:16:53.670 align:start position:0%
um so that
addresses

00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:53.680 align:start position:0%
addresses
 
00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:55.509 align:start position:0%
addresses
the

00:16:55.509 --> 00:16:55.519 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:16:57.670 --> 00:16:57.680 align:start position:0%
the additional questions that i had on
 
00:16:59.590 --> 00:16:59.600 align:start position:0%
the bill are there
 
00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:01.600 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions
 
00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:01.940 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions
um

00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:01.950 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:01.950 --> 00:17:03.509 align:start position:0%
um
[Music]

00:17:03.509 --> 00:17:03.519 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:17:05.669 --> 00:17:05.679 align:start position:0%
representative rogers representative
 
00:17:05.679 --> 00:17:07.429 align:start position:0%
representative rogers representative
waller

00:17:07.429 --> 00:17:07.439 align:start position:0%
waller
 
00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:09.839 align:start position:0%
you okay
 
00:17:12.549 --> 00:17:12.559 align:start position:0%
representative weiler representative irf
 
00:17:15.189 --> 00:17:15.199 align:start position:0%
representative bean anything
 
00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:16.880 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
00:17:20.549 --> 00:17:20.559 align:start position:0%
um so what i think we've achieved
 
00:17:24.069 --> 00:17:24.079 align:start position:0%
is is i think we've achieved clarity
 
00:17:29.669 --> 00:17:29.679 align:start position:0%
on the amendment to hb 103 um
 
00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:32.640 align:start position:0%
amendment 0 0868
 
00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:34.630 align:start position:0%
amendment 0 0868
hotel

00:17:34.630 --> 00:17:34.640 align:start position:0%
hotel
 
00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:36.240 align:start position:0%
and that
 
00:17:38.789 --> 00:17:38.799 align:start position:0%
i don't see any
 
00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:40.140 align:start position:0%
opposition to
 
00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:41.990 align:start position:0%
opposition to
[Music]

00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:17:44.470 --> 00:17:44.480 align:start position:0%
modifying this language so that it
 
00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:47.440 align:start position:0%
reflects that personal responsibility is
 
00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:50.640 align:start position:0%
also a key aspect of the program is
 
00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:52.720 align:start position:0%
there any opposition to that you know
 
00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:54.400 align:start position:0%
from the department from anyone in the
 
00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:56.870 align:start position:0%
from the department from anyone in the
committee

00:17:56.870 --> 00:17:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:57.750 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:17:57.750 --> 00:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:17:59.430 --> 00:17:59.440 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:04.240 align:start position:0%
with that i uh i think we'll put hb 103
 
00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
into recess
 
00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:08.480 align:start position:0%
uh believing that it's possible ols can
 
00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:11.360 align:start position:0%
deliver a fresh amendment before we
 
00:18:14.710 --> 00:18:14.720 align:start position:0%
finish hb 1677
 
00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:17.360 align:start position:0%
this afternoon
 
00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:32.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:35.120 align:start position:0%
okay so the status for anyone in the
 
00:18:37.029 --> 00:18:37.039 align:start position:0%
room who's curious is the next thing
 
00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:38.760 align:start position:0%
we're going to do is hb
 
00:18:41.909 --> 00:18:41.919 align:start position:0%
1677. that's in the house calendar at
 
00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:44.320 align:start position:0%
two o'clock so we can't start before two
 
00:18:47.669 --> 00:18:47.679 align:start position:0%
o'clock so um the committee
 
00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:50.080 align:start position:0%
is really on recess until two o'clock
 
00:18:53.029 --> 00:18:53.039 align:start position:0%
until we hit 1677 have division one join
 
00:18:53.039 --> 01:02:02.710 align:start position:0%
until we hit 1677 have division one join
us

01:02:02.710 --> 01:02:02.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:05.589 --> 01:02:05.599 align:start position:0%
it's uh it's two o'clock and so i'm
 
01:02:07.589 --> 01:02:07.599 align:start position:0%
going to call this
 
01:02:10.150 --> 01:02:10.160 align:start position:0%
hearing into session this is the hearing
 
01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:11.349 align:start position:0%
hearing into session this is the hearing
on

01:02:11.349 --> 01:02:11.359 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:02:11.359 --> 01:02:16.470 align:start position:0%
on
hb1677fn

01:02:16.470 --> 01:02:16.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:20.630 --> 01:02:20.640 align:start position:0%
for those of you who are following along
 
01:02:21.670 --> 01:02:21.680 align:start position:0%
we are
 
01:02:24.150 --> 01:02:24.160 align:start position:0%
primarily referring to
 
01:02:26.309 --> 01:02:26.319 align:start position:0%
the umberger amendment
 
01:02:26.319 --> 01:02:31.309 align:start position:0%
the umberger amendment
that's

01:02:31.309 --> 01:02:31.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:35.109 --> 01:02:35.119 align:start position:0%
2022-80891 hotel
 
01:02:38.069 --> 01:02:38.079 align:start position:0%
keep that distinguished in your notes
 
01:02:39.910 --> 01:02:39.920 align:start position:0%
you may want to write big on that that
 
01:02:42.150 --> 01:02:42.160 align:start position:0%
that's the official version and the
 
01:02:44.470 --> 01:02:44.480 align:start position:0%
reason i point that out is because the
 
01:02:47.829 --> 01:02:47.839 align:start position:0%
victims council has already has also
 
01:02:49.349 --> 01:02:49.359 align:start position:0%
submitted a
 
01:02:51.589 --> 01:02:51.599 align:start position:0%
i'll call it a red line with their
 
01:02:53.910 --> 01:02:53.920 align:start position:0%
recommendation recommended changes and
 
01:02:55.829 --> 01:02:55.839 align:start position:0%
so they look similar
 
01:02:59.270 --> 01:02:59.280 align:start position:0%
you'll want to keep them distinct
 
01:03:01.270 --> 01:03:01.280 align:start position:0%
the other thing that the victims council
 
01:03:04.870 --> 01:03:04.880 align:start position:0%
has provided us is a summary of changes
 
01:03:07.510 --> 01:03:07.520 align:start position:0%
required by the victims council
 
01:03:08.950 --> 01:03:08.960 align:start position:0%
that's a
 
01:03:12.549 --> 01:03:12.559 align:start position:0%
a bullet list of 10 items
 
01:03:16.150 --> 01:03:16.160 align:start position:0%
we're going to walk through that um
 
01:03:18.950 --> 01:03:18.960 align:start position:0%
in in in discussion
 
01:03:20.950 --> 01:03:20.960 align:start position:0%
um i think i think
 
01:03:23.029 --> 01:03:23.039 align:start position:0%
i think there may be four
 
01:03:25.829 --> 01:03:25.839 align:start position:0%
additional items beyond the ten
 
01:03:27.510 --> 01:03:27.520 align:start position:0%
brought up by the uh
 
01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:28.630 align:start position:0%
brought up by the uh
council

01:03:28.630 --> 01:03:28.640 align:start position:0%
council
 
01:03:31.270 --> 01:03:31.280 align:start position:0%
uh that we're also going to talk about
 
01:03:31.280 --> 01:03:34.309 align:start position:0%
uh that we're also going to talk about
so

01:03:34.309 --> 01:03:34.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:37.829 --> 01:03:37.839 align:start position:0%
what could very likely happen given the
 
01:03:39.109 --> 01:03:39.119 align:start position:0%
the number
 
01:03:42.309 --> 01:03:42.319 align:start position:0%
of recommended changes before us
 
01:03:44.470 --> 01:03:44.480 align:start position:0%
and given that the finance committee
 
01:03:47.190 --> 01:03:47.200 align:start position:0%
needs to know our position
 
01:03:50.150 --> 01:03:50.160 align:start position:0%
on the 8th of march
 
01:03:53.190 --> 01:03:53.200 align:start position:0%
i i think we're going to end up going
 
01:03:55.829 --> 01:03:55.839 align:start position:0%
through everything we can today
 
01:03:57.990 --> 01:03:58.000 align:start position:0%
come into as much agreement as we can
 
01:03:58.000 --> 01:03:59.190 align:start position:0%
come into as much agreement as we can
today

01:03:59.190 --> 01:03:59.200 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:04:01.829 --> 01:04:01.839 align:start position:0%
and then recess
 
01:04:03.750 --> 01:04:03.760 align:start position:0%
until thursday
 
01:04:05.510 --> 01:04:05.520 align:start position:0%
at 2 p.m
 
01:04:07.349 --> 01:04:07.359 align:start position:0%
the reason we're starting at 2 p.m
 
01:04:09.990 --> 01:04:10.000 align:start position:0%
instead of earlier that day is our our
 
01:04:12.470 --> 01:04:12.480 align:start position:0%
chairwoman has a
 
01:04:14.309 --> 01:04:14.319 align:start position:0%
medical appointment
 
01:04:16.150 --> 01:04:16.160 align:start position:0%
and we want to make sure she gets to
 
01:04:18.870 --> 01:04:18.880 align:start position:0%
that and can come join us before we wrap
 
01:04:18.880 --> 01:04:20.710 align:start position:0%
that and can come join us before we wrap
up

01:04:20.710 --> 01:04:20.720 align:start position:0%
up
 
01:04:23.750 --> 01:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
so so that's kind of my overview of of
 
01:04:25.990 --> 01:04:26.000 align:start position:0%
where we're at and what i think we're
 
01:04:28.390 --> 01:04:28.400 align:start position:0%
going to do today it's going to be
 
01:04:30.309 --> 01:04:30.319 align:start position:0%
walking through
 
01:04:33.910 --> 01:04:33.920 align:start position:0%
the list of 10 items plus four
 
01:04:37.109 --> 01:04:37.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:40.150 --> 01:04:40.160 align:start position:0%
and we're going to have a show of hands
 
01:04:41.270 --> 01:04:41.280 align:start position:0%
one moment
 
01:04:42.870 --> 01:04:42.880 align:start position:0%
we're going to end up having a show of
 
01:04:46.069 --> 01:04:46.079 align:start position:0%
hands at each of these bullet points
 
01:04:47.829 --> 01:04:47.839 align:start position:0%
just to get a sense of the committee on
 
01:04:49.589 --> 01:04:49.599 align:start position:0%
where we're at because we need to give
 
01:04:51.829 --> 01:04:51.839 align:start position:0%
guidance on what changes to incorporate
 
01:04:53.670 --> 01:04:53.680 align:start position:0%
and which ones we won't so
 
01:04:55.029 --> 01:04:55.039 align:start position:0%
representative rogers you have a
 
01:04:55.039 --> 01:04:57.510 align:start position:0%
representative rogers you have a
question

01:04:57.510 --> 01:04:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:00.150 --> 01:05:00.160 align:start position:0%
thursday the third you want to meet at
 
01:05:01.829 --> 01:05:01.839 align:start position:0%
two o'clock you said
 
01:05:03.829 --> 01:05:03.839 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am okay and how long do you have
 
01:05:05.190 --> 01:05:05.200 align:start position:0%
an idea of how long you think we'll be
 
01:05:06.789 --> 01:05:06.799 align:start position:0%
here then
 
01:05:10.390 --> 01:05:10.400 align:start position:0%
well i i i think that we could finish in
 
01:05:12.789 --> 01:05:12.799 align:start position:0%
90 minutes or less and the reason i
 
01:05:14.630 --> 01:05:14.640 align:start position:0%
think that is because
 
01:05:17.349 --> 01:05:17.359 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll have done the discussion and
 
01:05:18.789 --> 01:05:18.799 align:start position:0%
straw votes
 
01:05:18.799 --> 01:05:19.910 align:start position:0%
straw votes
today

01:05:19.910 --> 01:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:05:22.710 --> 01:05:22.720 align:start position:0%
and then come thursday
 
01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:23.430 align:start position:0%
and then come thursday

the third at 2 p.m
 
01:05:28.150 --> 01:05:28.160 align:start position:0%
at that point we're just validating that
 
01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:29.430 align:start position:0%
at that point we're just validating that
the

01:05:29.430 --> 01:05:29.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:05:32.309 --> 01:05:32.319 align:start position:0%
that ols has crafted a version that we
 
01:05:35.190 --> 01:05:35.200 align:start position:0%
can pass to the finance committee so so
 
01:05:37.109 --> 01:05:37.119 align:start position:0%
i don't see a lot of discussion on on
 
01:05:38.870 --> 01:05:38.880 align:start position:0%
thursday afternoon
 
01:05:41.829 --> 01:05:41.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:41.839 --> 01:05:42.789 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:05:42.789 --> 01:05:42.799 align:start position:0%

01:05:52.309 --> 01:05:52.319 align:start position:0%
the changes that
 
01:05:54.950 --> 01:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
kevin and mike have been working on
 
01:05:57.109 --> 01:05:57.119 align:start position:0%
that deal with finance
 
01:05:59.990 --> 01:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
to let them go through those before we
 
01:06:01.910 --> 01:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
start on this
 
01:06:03.190 --> 01:06:03.200 align:start position:0%
if that's okay
 
01:06:05.910 --> 01:06:05.920 align:start position:0%
or whenever you want to do it but we did
 
01:06:07.990 --> 01:06:08.000 align:start position:0%
make some
 
01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:09.670 align:start position:0%
make some

01:07:34.789 --> 01:07:34.799 align:start position:0%
the first item is
 
01:07:36.069 --> 01:07:36.079 align:start position:0%
that the
 
01:07:37.990 --> 01:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
attorney general
 
01:07:41.190 --> 01:07:41.200 align:start position:0%

and the third item is that the
 
01:07:53.109 --> 01:07:53.119 align:start position:0%
appropriation instead of coming from the
 
01:07:55.029 --> 01:07:55.039 align:start position:0%
general fund would come from the rainy
 
01:07:58.230 --> 01:07:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:01.190 --> 01:08:01.200 align:start position:0%
so on page one
 
01:08:05.270 --> 01:08:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:08.150 --> 01:08:08.160 align:start position:0%
the administrator previously it read
 
01:08:10.230 --> 01:08:10.240 align:start position:0%
that the administrator has management of
 
01:08:15.750 --> 01:08:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:19.990 --> 01:08:20.000 align:start position:0%
on page 2 line 15 it reads that the fund
 
01:08:21.910 --> 01:08:21.920 align:start position:0%
should be administered by the attorney
 
01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:24.789 align:start position:0%
should be administered by the attorney
general

01:08:24.789 --> 01:08:24.799 align:start position:0%
general
 
01:08:27.430 --> 01:08:27.440 align:start position:0%
then on lines
 
01:08:30.630 --> 01:08:30.640 align:start position:0%
17 through 24
 
01:08:32.390 --> 01:08:32.400 align:start position:0%
most of that's new the fun should be
 
01:08:34.870 --> 01:08:34.880 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing continually appropriated to
 
01:08:36.870 --> 01:08:36.880 align:start position:0%
the department of justice
 
01:08:39.189 --> 01:08:39.199 align:start position:0%
on line 17
 
01:08:41.510 --> 01:08:41.520 align:start position:0%
then on light 18
 
01:08:43.990 --> 01:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
the fun shall be non-lapsing and
 
01:08:45.269 --> 01:08:45.279 align:start position:0%
continually appropriated to the
 
01:08:48.149 --> 01:08:48.159 align:start position:0%
department of justice until june
 
01:08:48.159 --> 01:08:50.070 align:start position:0%
department of justice until june
2032

01:08:50.070 --> 01:08:50.080 align:start position:0%
2032
 
01:08:52.070 --> 01:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
at which date the fund should lapse to
 
01:08:54.070 --> 01:08:54.080 align:start position:0%
the revenue stabilization reserve
 
01:08:57.030 --> 01:08:57.040 align:start position:0%
account instead of the general fund
 
01:08:58.309 --> 01:08:58.319 align:start position:0%
that's the
 
01:09:04.870 --> 01:09:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:07.669 --> 01:09:07.679 align:start position:0%
then the following line
 
01:09:10.470 --> 01:09:10.480 align:start position:0%
used to read that the administrator
 
01:09:10.480 --> 01:09:12.229 align:start position:0%
used to read that the administrator
would

01:09:12.229 --> 01:09:12.239 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:09:14.390 --> 01:09:14.400 align:start position:0%
make the determination of whether it's
 
01:09:16.709 --> 01:09:16.719 align:start position:0%
when the fund is discontinued and this
 
01:09:19.510 --> 01:09:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:21.269 --> 01:09:21.279 align:start position:0%
allow for consultation between the
 
01:09:26.390 --> 01:09:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:29.829 --> 01:09:29.839 align:start position:0%
the next sentence makes it clear that
 
01:09:31.910 --> 01:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
the settlements will be paid according
 
01:09:35.669 --> 01:09:35.679 align:start position:0%
to the process laid out in the bill
 
01:09:36.709 --> 01:09:36.719 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:09:38.709 --> 01:09:38.719 align:start position:0%
the last sentence provides that the
 
01:09:40.470 --> 01:09:40.480 align:start position:0%
attorney general may enter into
 
01:09:42.149 --> 01:09:42.159 align:start position:0%
agreements with the
 
01:09:44.870 --> 01:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
judicial branch or other agencies to
 
01:09:48.309 --> 01:09:48.319 align:start position:0%
compensate them for services related to
 
01:09:50.390 --> 01:09:50.400 align:start position:0%
things performed in accordance with this
 
01:09:50.400 --> 01:09:56.470 align:start position:0%
things performed in accordance with this
chapter

01:09:56.470 --> 01:09:56.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:00.950 --> 01:10:00.960 align:start position:0%
and if we flip all the way to page
 
01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:02.790 align:start position:0%
and if we flip all the way to page
eight

01:10:02.790 --> 01:10:02.800 align:start position:0%
eight
 
01:10:06.950 --> 01:10:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:09.189 --> 01:10:09.199 align:start position:0%
it reads if the administrator determines
 
01:10:11.270 --> 01:10:11.280 align:start position:0%
that a shortfall in the ydc settlement
 
01:10:12.630 --> 01:10:12.640 align:start position:0%
fund is likely to occur the
 
01:10:15.270 --> 01:10:15.280 align:start position:0%
administrator in consultation with the
 
01:10:16.709 --> 01:10:16.719 align:start position:0%
attorney general
 
01:10:23.270 --> 01:10:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:25.590 --> 01:10:25.600 align:start position:0%
similar change on line 35 the
 
01:10:28.310 --> 01:10:28.320 align:start position:0%
administrator in consultation with the
 
01:10:30.709 --> 01:10:30.719 align:start position:0%
attorney general shall submit a
 
01:10:33.750 --> 01:10:33.760 align:start position:0%
quarterly report
 
01:10:36.470 --> 01:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
then the last changes are in section
 
01:10:39.270 --> 01:10:39.280 align:start position:0%
four on page nine
 
01:10:41.510 --> 01:10:41.520 align:start position:0%
that was changed to from the general
 
01:10:43.750 --> 01:10:43.760 align:start position:0%
fund to the revenue stabilization
 
01:10:45.510 --> 01:10:45.520 align:start position:0%
reserve account
 
01:10:48.550 --> 01:10:48.560 align:start position:0%
and the final change is that
 
01:10:52.550 --> 01:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
any unexpended fund as of 2032
 
01:10:55.830 --> 01:10:55.840 align:start position:0%
will lapse to the revenue stabilization
 
01:10:57.669 --> 01:10:57.679 align:start position:0%
reserve account instead of the general
 
01:10:57.679 --> 01:11:05.590 align:start position:0%
reserve account instead of the general
fund

01:11:05.590 --> 01:11:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:07.669 --> 01:11:07.679 align:start position:0%
before i'll come to you in a second
 
01:11:10.630 --> 01:11:10.640 align:start position:0%
representative umberger
 
01:11:13.030 --> 01:11:13.040 align:start position:0%
it seems to me i i think we also talked
 
01:11:15.189 --> 01:11:15.199 align:start position:0%
about adding a sunset
 
01:11:17.669 --> 01:11:17.679 align:start position:0%
provision in here to to close the law
 
01:11:20.470 --> 01:11:20.480 align:start position:0%
out uh at some point did
 
01:11:23.189 --> 01:11:23.199 align:start position:0%
did you think about that mr hoffman or
 
01:11:25.270 --> 01:11:25.280 align:start position:0%
or did we confuse you i think that was
 
01:11:27.270 --> 01:11:27.280 align:start position:0%
the last item on the attorney attorney
 
01:11:27.280 --> 01:11:28.950 align:start position:0%
the last item on the attorney attorney
general's

01:11:28.950 --> 01:11:28.960 align:start position:0%
general's
 
01:11:31.110 --> 01:11:31.120 align:start position:0%
most recent list
 
01:11:33.430 --> 01:11:33.440 align:start position:0%
and we didn't have any information i
 
01:11:35.030 --> 01:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
don't know if mr formella has
 
01:11:43.270 --> 01:11:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:45.350 --> 01:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
yeah so so our plan with that was just
 
01:11:46.470 --> 01:11:46.480 align:start position:0%
to see
 
01:11:48.709 --> 01:11:48.719 align:start position:0%
once we got to the point where we we
 
01:11:50.709 --> 01:11:50.719 align:start position:0%
thought this was in very close to final
 
01:11:52.149 --> 01:11:52.159 align:start position:0%
form we were going to draft that
 
01:11:53.590 --> 01:11:53.600 align:start position:0%
language so
 
01:11:56.630 --> 01:11:56.640 align:start position:0%
what we after we get through today and
 
01:11:59.030 --> 01:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
we hear the committee's straw votes on
 
01:12:01.189 --> 01:12:01.199 align:start position:0%
the various potential changes
 
01:12:02.870 --> 01:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
we were going to plan to potentially
 
01:12:04.630 --> 01:12:04.640 align:start position:0%
work with kevin on any last minute
 
01:12:04.640 --> 01:12:06.229 align:start position:0%
work with kevin on any last minute
changes

01:12:06.229 --> 01:12:06.239 align:start position:0%
changes
 
01:12:09.030 --> 01:12:09.040 align:start position:0%
that come out of today i will also plan
 
01:12:11.990 --> 01:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
to bring some language to
 
01:12:14.709 --> 01:12:14.719 align:start position:0%
whatever that quick work session is uh
 
01:12:17.110 --> 01:12:17.120 align:start position:0%
regarding sun setting it just it's got
 
01:12:19.350 --> 01:12:19.360 align:start position:0%
to be before then
 
01:12:21.110 --> 01:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
has to be before then because that's the
 
01:12:22.790 --> 01:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
final thing
 
01:12:24.470 --> 01:12:24.480 align:start position:0%
the sun
 
01:12:26.149 --> 01:12:26.159 align:start position:0%
what's the final thing sorry you can't
 
01:12:27.590 --> 01:12:27.600 align:start position:0%
wait till friday
 
01:12:29.030 --> 01:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
or thursday oh no i wasn't going to wait
 
01:12:30.870 --> 01:12:30.880 align:start position:0%
till thursday okay i meant
 
01:12:31.830 --> 01:12:31.840 align:start position:0%
we were
 
01:12:33.510 --> 01:12:33.520 align:start position:0%
by work session i meant we were going to
 
01:12:35.030 --> 01:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
plan and we haven't even told you this
 
01:12:37.110 --> 01:12:37.120 align:start position:0%
yet kevin bob and i we were going to
 
01:12:38.229 --> 01:12:38.239 align:start position:0%
plan to get together with you
 
01:12:40.470 --> 01:12:40.480 align:start position:0%
potentially before thursday just to help
 
01:12:42.149 --> 01:12:42.159 align:start position:0%
to make sure we iron out any changes
 
01:12:44.070 --> 01:12:44.080 align:start position:0%
that come out of today and make sure we
 
01:12:46.390 --> 01:12:46.400 align:start position:0%
get them right since we know thursday
 
01:12:49.510 --> 01:12:49.520 align:start position:0%
will be the committees for the divisions
 
01:12:51.189 --> 01:12:51.199 align:start position:0%
final work session
 
01:12:53.830 --> 01:12:53.840 align:start position:0%
so we'll have that ready before thursday
 
01:12:56.149 --> 01:12:56.159 align:start position:0%
so so when you say you plan to have this
 
01:12:58.709 --> 01:12:58.719 align:start position:0%
work group meeting before thursday and
 
01:13:01.430 --> 01:13:01.440 align:start position:0%
today being tuesday that means tomorrow
 
01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:04.070 align:start position:0%
today being tuesday that means tomorrow
yes

01:13:04.070 --> 01:13:04.080 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:13:06.229 --> 01:13:06.239 align:start position:0%
well thank you very much uh
 
01:13:08.790 --> 01:13:08.800 align:start position:0%
go ahead representative amber yes um i'm
 
01:13:11.430 --> 01:13:11.440 align:start position:0%
sorry i do have one other thing and that
 
01:13:11.440 --> 01:13:12.550 align:start position:0%
sorry i do have one other thing and that
is

01:13:12.550 --> 01:13:12.560 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:13.350 align:start position:0%
is
um

01:13:13.350 --> 01:13:13.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:16.470 --> 01:13:16.480 align:start position:0%
i've talked to mike and kevin about this
 
01:13:18.790 --> 01:13:18.800 align:start position:0%
and this is on page two
 
01:13:22.149 --> 01:13:22.159 align:start position:0%
dealing with how we're going to pay
 
01:13:22.159 --> 01:13:22.950 align:start position:0%
dealing with how we're going to pay
this

01:13:22.950 --> 01:13:22.960 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:13:25.669 --> 01:13:25.679 align:start position:0%
person if it happens to be a retired
 
01:13:25.679 --> 01:13:27.030 align:start position:0%
person if it happens to be a retired
judge

01:13:27.030 --> 01:13:27.040 align:start position:0%
judge
 
01:13:29.590 --> 01:13:29.600 align:start position:0%
uh retired judges
 
01:13:32.390 --> 01:13:32.400 align:start position:0%
cannot go back into the retirement
 
01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:33.990 align:start position:0%
cannot go back into the retirement
system

01:13:33.990 --> 01:13:34.000 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:35.750 align:start position:0%
system
or

01:13:35.750 --> 01:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:13:37.270 --> 01:13:37.280 align:start position:0%
in the i mean they're already in a
 
01:13:38.950 --> 01:13:38.960 align:start position:0%
medical thing
 
01:13:41.669 --> 01:13:41.679 align:start position:0%
so we'll have to um
 
01:13:44.550 --> 01:13:44.560 align:start position:0%
kind of firm up some language in there
 
01:13:48.950 --> 01:13:48.960 align:start position:0%
that says if it's a retired judge then
 
01:13:51.430 --> 01:13:51.440 align:start position:0%
you know they don't get the benefits or
 
01:13:55.189 --> 01:13:55.199 align:start position:0%
will give them the benefits and
 
01:13:57.590 --> 01:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
you know the same monetary benefits as
 
01:13:59.030 --> 01:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
if they
 
01:14:02.550 --> 01:14:02.560 align:start position:0%
were collecting them or you know so
 
01:14:04.390 --> 01:14:04.400 align:start position:0%
okay okay so the bottom line on your
 
01:14:06.390 --> 01:14:06.400 align:start position:0%
comment is when you need additional
 
01:14:08.950 --> 01:14:08.960 align:start position:0%
language to to handle the special case
 
01:14:12.070 --> 01:14:12.080 align:start position:0%
of of a retired judge just for yeah
 
01:14:14.870 --> 01:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
that's correct all right
 
01:14:14.880 --> 01:14:18.470 align:start position:0%
that's correct all right
okay

01:14:18.470 --> 01:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:21.750 --> 01:14:21.760 align:start position:0%
okay so let's let's stay focused on uh
 
01:14:25.270 --> 01:14:25.280 align:start position:0%
mr hoffman's review of the inclusion of
 
01:14:27.750 --> 01:14:27.760 align:start position:0%
the three financial elements
 
01:14:30.229 --> 01:14:30.239 align:start position:0%
are there any questions of the committee
 
01:14:33.990 --> 01:14:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:35.669 --> 01:14:35.679 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:14:35.679 --> 01:14:36.550 align:start position:0%
thank you
so

01:14:36.550 --> 01:14:36.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:14:38.470 --> 01:14:38.480 align:start position:0%
i wondered why
 
01:14:40.870 --> 01:14:40.880 align:start position:0%
what the thinking was behind
 
01:14:42.390 --> 01:14:42.400 align:start position:0%
using the revenue
 
01:14:45.350 --> 01:14:45.360 align:start position:0%
stabilization reserve account
 
01:14:46.870 --> 01:14:46.880 align:start position:0%
instead of
 
01:14:46.880 --> 01:14:49.430 align:start position:0%
instead of
existing

01:14:49.430 --> 01:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
existing
 
01:14:52.229 --> 01:14:52.239 align:start position:0%
revenues and secondly
 
01:14:54.950 --> 01:14:54.960 align:start position:0%
i'd like a refresher about how we open
 
01:14:56.950 --> 01:14:56.960 align:start position:0%
up the
 
01:14:58.870 --> 01:14:58.880 align:start position:0%
rainy day fund i
 
01:15:02.310 --> 01:15:02.320 align:start position:0%
thought there were some very specific
 
01:15:05.270 --> 01:15:05.280 align:start position:0%
guidelines standards around how we move
 
01:15:07.590 --> 01:15:07.600 align:start position:0%
forward with opening up the rainy day
 
01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:13.830 align:start position:0%
forward with opening up the rainy day
fund

01:15:13.830 --> 01:15:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:16.470 --> 01:15:16.480 align:start position:0%
uh to answer your second question there
 
01:15:16.480 --> 01:15:17.430 align:start position:0%
uh to answer your second question there
are

01:15:17.430 --> 01:15:17.440 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:15:19.350 --> 01:15:19.360 align:start position:0%
and that's why this is written the way
 
01:15:24.950 --> 01:15:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:26.310 --> 01:15:26.320 align:start position:0%
so that
 
01:15:29.510 --> 01:15:29.520 align:start position:0%
the legislature doesn't have to
 
01:15:31.669 --> 01:15:31.679 align:start position:0%
vote specifically
 
01:15:31.679 --> 01:15:33.030 align:start position:0%
vote specifically
on

01:15:33.030 --> 01:15:33.040 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:15:35.270 --> 01:15:35.280 align:start position:0%
opening the rainy day fund
 
01:15:38.550 --> 01:15:38.560 align:start position:0%
but rather through this bill
 
01:15:40.390 --> 01:15:40.400 align:start position:0%
would approve
 
01:15:42.229 --> 01:15:42.239 align:start position:0%
using the dollars out of the rainy day
 
01:15:42.239 --> 01:15:49.990 align:start position:0%
using the dollars out of the rainy day
fund

01:15:49.990 --> 01:15:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:51.270 --> 01:15:51.280 align:start position:0%
do you want to continue that
 
01:15:53.270 --> 01:15:53.280 align:start position:0%
conversation represent walnut are you
 
01:15:55.510 --> 01:15:55.520 align:start position:0%
are you satisfied um well i guess i
 
01:15:57.189 --> 01:15:57.199 align:start position:0%
would like to know
 
01:16:00.790 --> 01:16:00.800 align:start position:0%
what the thinking is behind using the uh
 
01:16:03.669 --> 01:16:03.679 align:start position:0%
rainy day fund as opposed to
 
01:16:03.679 --> 01:16:04.790 align:start position:0%
rainy day fund as opposed to
our

01:16:04.790 --> 01:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:16:06.550 --> 01:16:06.560 align:start position:0%
revenues that are coming in our revenues
 
01:16:09.750 --> 01:16:09.760 align:start position:0%
have been coming in quite strong
 
01:16:09.760 --> 01:16:10.790 align:start position:0%
have been coming in quite strong
and

01:16:10.790 --> 01:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:16:12.229 --> 01:16:12.239 align:start position:0%
it seems like
 
01:16:13.910 --> 01:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
we do have
 
01:16:17.110 --> 01:16:17.120 align:start position:0%
funds available at this point
 
01:16:19.590 --> 01:16:19.600 align:start position:0%
part of the thinking behind that if i
 
01:16:19.600 --> 01:16:21.030 align:start position:0%
part of the thinking behind that if i
could

01:16:21.030 --> 01:16:21.040 align:start position:0%
could
 
01:16:22.550 --> 01:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:16:25.310 --> 01:16:25.320 align:start position:0%
we currently have about
 
01:16:30.950 --> 01:16:30.960 align:start position:0%
328 million dollars worth of bills
 
01:16:33.430 --> 01:16:33.440 align:start position:0%
that are before either the house or the
 
01:16:33.440 --> 01:16:35.669 align:start position:0%
that are before either the house or the
senate

01:16:35.669 --> 01:16:35.679 align:start position:0%
senate
 
01:16:37.590 --> 01:16:37.600 align:start position:0%
and that
 
01:16:39.830 --> 01:16:39.840 align:start position:0%
obviously spend money
 
01:16:43.110 --> 01:16:43.120 align:start position:0%
and those monies would be coming out of
 
01:16:43.120 --> 01:16:45.910 align:start position:0%
and those monies would be coming out of
the

01:16:45.910 --> 01:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:49.430 --> 01:16:49.440 align:start position:0%
revenue that is over projections
 
01:16:51.350 --> 01:16:51.360 align:start position:0%
and so we
 
01:16:54.709 --> 01:16:54.719 align:start position:0%
wanted to be able to um
 
01:16:57.830 --> 01:16:57.840 align:start position:0%
fund it would limit our ability
 
01:17:00.470 --> 01:17:00.480 align:start position:0%
to fund some of the
 
01:17:00.480 --> 01:17:03.270 align:start position:0%
to fund some of the
necessary

01:17:03.270 --> 01:17:03.280 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
01:17:06.229 --> 01:17:06.239 align:start position:0%
bills that we have out there and that's
 
01:17:06.239 --> 01:17:07.270 align:start position:0%
bills that we have out there and that's
why

01:17:07.270 --> 01:17:07.280 align:start position:0%
why
 
01:17:07.280 --> 01:17:08.310 align:start position:0%
why
we

01:17:08.310 --> 01:17:08.320 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:17:10.790 --> 01:17:10.800 align:start position:0%
opted to go to the
 
01:17:13.350 --> 01:17:13.360 align:start position:0%
revenue stabilization account
 
01:17:15.350 --> 01:17:15.360 align:start position:0%
may not be the best logic but that was
 
01:17:18.550 --> 01:17:18.560 align:start position:0%
the logic that i used
 
01:17:19.830 --> 01:17:19.840 align:start position:0%
great thank you
 
01:17:22.470 --> 01:17:22.480 align:start position:0%
could i ask one more question
 
01:17:24.390 --> 01:17:24.400 align:start position:0%
let me just jump into this conversation
 
01:17:26.310 --> 01:17:26.320 align:start position:0%
and then don't forget your question
 
01:17:26.320 --> 01:17:27.990 align:start position:0%
and then don't forget your question
so

01:17:27.990 --> 01:17:28.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:17:30.229 --> 01:17:30.239 align:start position:0%
so i i don't know i'm still a neophyte
 
01:17:32.550 --> 01:17:32.560 align:start position:0%
in many ways to to the things like the
 
01:17:34.709 --> 01:17:34.719 align:start position:0%
rainy day fund but it's it seems to me
 
01:17:37.830 --> 01:17:37.840 align:start position:0%
that given that we're going to be
 
01:17:41.270 --> 01:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
paying cases dating back decades
 
01:17:43.510 --> 01:17:43.520 align:start position:0%
that those were liabilities that we
 
01:17:47.189 --> 01:17:47.199 align:start position:0%
actually accrued long long long ago
 
01:17:49.669 --> 01:17:49.679 align:start position:0%
and that the monies
 
01:17:51.750 --> 01:17:51.760 align:start position:0%
from general revenues have added to the
 
01:17:54.550 --> 01:17:54.560 align:start position:0%
rainy day fund over those decades
 
01:17:57.030 --> 01:17:57.040 align:start position:0%
and so therefore if we were just trying
 
01:18:01.510 --> 01:18:01.520 align:start position:0%
to match liabilities to the right
 
01:18:04.470 --> 01:18:04.480 align:start position:0%
funding stream there seems logic to me
 
01:18:06.709 --> 01:18:06.719 align:start position:0%
of using the rainy day fund instead of
 
01:18:10.149 --> 01:18:10.159 align:start position:0%
the current year's revenues
 
01:18:12.149 --> 01:18:12.159 align:start position:0%
does that pass the common sense test to
 
01:18:16.709 --> 01:18:16.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:18.149 --> 01:18:18.159 align:start position:0%
do you have a question go ahead yeah i
 
01:18:20.149 --> 01:18:20.159 align:start position:0%
do have no further question i wondered
 
01:18:22.149 --> 01:18:22.159 align:start position:0%
if there had been any conversation with
 
01:18:24.630 --> 01:18:24.640 align:start position:0%
ways and means about
 
01:18:27.030 --> 01:18:27.040 align:start position:0%
the use of the rainy day fund as opposed
 
01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:28.229 align:start position:0%
the use of the rainy day fund as opposed
to

01:18:28.229 --> 01:18:28.239 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:18:29.830 --> 01:18:29.840 align:start position:0%
the um
 
01:18:31.669 --> 01:18:31.679 align:start position:0%
just regular revenues that we have
 
01:18:35.270 --> 01:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:40.630 --> 01:18:40.640 align:start position:0%
um we have had conversations uh with um
 
01:18:41.990 --> 01:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
ways and means
 
01:18:45.590 --> 01:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
uh not particularly dealing with uh what
 
01:18:47.669 --> 01:18:47.679 align:start position:0%
we what our conversation with ways and
 
01:18:51.030 --> 01:18:51.040 align:start position:0%
means was is what do we anticipate
 
01:18:53.590 --> 01:18:53.600 align:start position:0%
the um
 
01:18:53.600 --> 01:18:54.470 align:start position:0%
the um
excess

01:18:54.470 --> 01:18:54.480 align:start position:0%
excess
 
01:18:57.350 --> 01:18:57.360 align:start position:0%
maybe that's wrong to the revenues to be
 
01:19:00.310 --> 01:19:00.320 align:start position:0%
and what would be available
 
01:19:04.070 --> 01:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
but no i did not specifically
 
01:19:06.229 --> 01:19:06.239 align:start position:0%
talk to them about
 
01:19:08.790 --> 01:19:08.800 align:start position:0%
the revenue stabilization rate
 
01:19:10.709 --> 01:19:10.719 align:start position:0%
are you using the revenue stabilization
 
01:19:10.719 --> 01:19:15.189 align:start position:0%
are you using the revenue stabilization
money

01:19:15.189 --> 01:19:15.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:15.199 --> 01:19:16.070 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:19:16.070 --> 01:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:19:18.550 --> 01:19:18.560 align:start position:0%
you're you're done then represent okay
 
01:19:19.830 --> 01:19:19.840 align:start position:0%
so i
 
01:19:22.790 --> 01:19:22.800 align:start position:0%
i i think i'm going to try
 
01:19:25.510 --> 01:19:25.520 align:start position:0%
a quick straw vote on this particular
 
01:19:27.590 --> 01:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
issue just to make sure that i know how
 
01:19:30.390 --> 01:19:30.400 align:start position:0%
to conduct a straw vote
 
01:19:30.400 --> 01:19:31.590 align:start position:0%
to conduct a straw vote
so

01:19:31.590 --> 01:19:31.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:19:34.470 --> 01:19:34.480 align:start position:0%
what i'd like to do is ask for a show of
 
01:19:37.270 --> 01:19:37.280 align:start position:0%
hands and i'm going to ask basically two
 
01:19:39.189 --> 01:19:39.199 align:start position:0%
questions one is
 
01:19:41.430 --> 01:19:41.440 align:start position:0%
are you in support of using the rainy
 
01:19:44.390 --> 01:19:44.400 align:start position:0%
day funds as the source of funding for
 
01:19:46.709 --> 01:19:46.719 align:start position:0%
for this settlement fund
 
01:19:50.709 --> 01:19:50.719 align:start position:0%
and then the alternative question is
 
01:19:53.750 --> 01:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
do you support instead using
 
01:19:53.760 --> 01:19:55.189 align:start position:0%
do you support instead using
current

01:19:55.189 --> 01:19:55.199 align:start position:0%
current
 
01:19:57.510 --> 01:19:57.520 align:start position:0%
general funds for that purpose
 
01:19:58.709 --> 01:19:58.719 align:start position:0%
would that get at your issue
 
01:20:03.110 --> 01:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:06.149 --> 01:20:06.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:08.950 --> 01:20:08.960 align:start position:0%
all right so uh i would like a show of
 
01:20:11.910 --> 01:20:11.920 align:start position:0%
hands please and um mr uh clerk if you
 
01:20:13.350 --> 01:20:13.360 align:start position:0%
could just help me with the show of
 
01:20:14.629 --> 01:20:14.639 align:start position:0%
hands count
 
01:20:17.669 --> 01:20:17.679 align:start position:0%
um all those who are in favor of using
 
01:20:20.550 --> 01:20:20.560 align:start position:0%
the rainy day fund to finance
 
01:20:22.790 --> 01:20:22.800 align:start position:0%
the settlement fund please raise your
 
01:20:22.800 --> 01:20:30.310 align:start position:0%
the settlement fund please raise your
hand

01:20:30.310 --> 01:20:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:32.870 --> 01:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
clerk counts 10.
 
01:20:34.709 --> 01:20:34.719 align:start position:0%
those in favor
 
01:20:36.070 --> 01:20:36.080 align:start position:0%
of using
 
01:20:38.550 --> 01:20:38.560 align:start position:0%
current general revenue please raise
 
01:20:43.910 --> 01:20:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:47.030 --> 01:20:47.040 align:start position:0%
the count is 5. so we have uh ten to
 
01:20:49.990 --> 01:20:50.000 align:start position:0%
five to continue to
 
01:20:51.830 --> 01:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
to leave the language in for the rainy
 
01:20:53.270 --> 01:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
day fund
 
01:20:56.070 --> 01:20:56.080 align:start position:0%
uh i didn't notice any discussion
 
01:20:59.110 --> 01:20:59.120 align:start position:0%
around um the sec the first two bullets
 
01:21:01.189 --> 01:21:01.199 align:start position:0%
that we that mr hoffman talked us
 
01:21:01.199 --> 01:21:02.070 align:start position:0%
that we that mr hoffman talked us
through

01:21:02.070 --> 01:21:02.080 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:21:04.550 --> 01:21:04.560 align:start position:0%
the control of the fund and and how we
 
01:21:06.709 --> 01:21:06.719 align:start position:0%
would handle reimbursements are there
 
01:21:08.790 --> 01:21:08.800 align:start position:0%
any issues there does anyone have any
 
01:21:11.110 --> 01:21:11.120 align:start position:0%
concern or can i just assume that we're
 
01:21:15.350 --> 01:21:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:17.430 --> 01:21:17.440 align:start position:0%
go ahead would it be possible for mr
 
01:21:18.870 --> 01:21:18.880 align:start position:0%
hoffman to again
 
01:21:22.070 --> 01:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
point me to the right place in the
 
01:21:22.080 --> 01:21:23.590 align:start position:0%
point me to the right place in the
document

01:21:23.590 --> 01:21:23.600 align:start position:0%
document
 
01:21:25.990 --> 01:21:26.000 align:start position:0%
to find that
 
01:21:28.709 --> 01:21:28.719 align:start position:0%
to find which well i want to know about
 
01:21:31.030 --> 01:21:31.040 align:start position:0%
the reimbursement to
 
01:21:34.790 --> 01:21:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:37.350 --> 01:21:37.360 align:start position:0%
yes the language for re uh reimbursing
 
01:21:39.750 --> 01:21:39.760 align:start position:0%
other agencies is on page two and it
 
01:21:53.830 --> 01:21:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:56.390 --> 01:21:56.400 align:start position:0%
could i ask a question about it please
 
01:21:58.709 --> 01:21:58.719 align:start position:0%
so um
 
01:22:00.790 --> 01:22:00.800 align:start position:0%
when you talk about it when it talks
 
01:22:02.550 --> 01:22:02.560 align:start position:0%
about any
 
01:22:05.430 --> 01:22:05.440 align:start position:0%
state agency as necessary to compensate
 
01:22:08.149 --> 01:22:08.159 align:start position:0%
them for services performed
 
01:22:10.229 --> 01:22:10.239 align:start position:0%
who do you who do you have in mind other
 
01:22:17.110 --> 01:22:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:18.870 --> 01:22:18.880 align:start position:0%
if um
 
01:22:20.070 --> 01:22:20.080 align:start position:0%
if i might
 
01:22:22.070 --> 01:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
please go ahead and your microphone's
 
01:22:25.189 --> 01:22:25.199 align:start position:0%
still on mr yeah okay um there may be
 
01:22:27.030 --> 01:22:27.040 align:start position:0%
some requirements from health and human
 
01:22:27.040 --> 01:22:28.709 align:start position:0%
some requirements from health and human
services

01:22:28.709 --> 01:22:28.719 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:22:31.910 --> 01:22:31.920 align:start position:0%
to to go back into uh
 
01:22:34.870 --> 01:22:34.880 align:start position:0%
records that they may have
 
01:22:36.709 --> 01:22:36.719 align:start position:0%
dealing with the
 
01:22:38.470 --> 01:22:38.480 align:start position:0%
people that were
 
01:22:38.480 --> 01:22:41.430 align:start position:0%
people that were
incarcerated

01:22:41.430 --> 01:22:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:45.110 --> 01:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:48.390 --> 01:22:48.400 align:start position:0%
that's the primarily primary other
 
01:22:50.229 --> 01:22:50.239 align:start position:0%
agency that might
 
01:22:53.910 --> 01:22:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:55.910 --> 01:22:55.920 align:start position:0%
if they had to you know
 
01:22:58.070 --> 01:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
hire somebody to
 
01:23:00.229 --> 01:23:00.239 align:start position:0%
do that work for them
 
01:23:01.990 --> 01:23:02.000 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
01:23:04.229 --> 01:23:04.239 align:start position:0%
so this probably is more of a question
 
01:23:07.510 --> 01:23:07.520 align:start position:0%
for the attorney general i what i am
 
01:23:10.629 --> 01:23:10.639 align:start position:0%
wondering is would you put some come on
 
01:23:12.709 --> 01:23:12.719 align:start position:0%
up mr formula
 
01:23:14.470 --> 01:23:14.480 align:start position:0%
it's probably really quick it's either
 
01:23:16.950 --> 01:23:16.960 align:start position:0%
probably yes or no but um and i can
 
01:23:19.910 --> 01:23:19.920 align:start position:0%
imagine what it will be um would you put
 
01:23:21.750 --> 01:23:21.760 align:start position:0%
some limit
 
01:23:25.830 --> 01:23:25.840 align:start position:0%
on the amount that um another agency was
 
01:23:26.950 --> 01:23:26.960 align:start position:0%
able to
 
01:23:29.189 --> 01:23:29.199 align:start position:0%
take from this fun i mean
 
01:23:31.030 --> 01:23:31.040 align:start position:0%
basically they're it's coming out of the
 
01:23:33.350 --> 01:23:33.360 align:start position:0%
fund so every time someone gets money
 
01:23:34.390 --> 01:23:34.400 align:start position:0%
out of the fund
 
01:23:36.310 --> 01:23:36.320 align:start position:0%
the fund goes down and less for the
 
01:23:36.320 --> 01:23:37.669 align:start position:0%
the fund goes down and less for the
victims

01:23:37.669 --> 01:23:37.679 align:start position:0%
victims
 
01:23:39.669 --> 01:23:39.679 align:start position:0%
so how would you
 
01:23:43.669 --> 01:23:43.679 align:start position:0%
monitor that yes the goal would be to to
 
01:23:45.669 --> 01:23:45.679 align:start position:0%
minimize the extent to which the fund is
 
01:23:47.510 --> 01:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
tapped as much as we could i mean i
 
01:23:47.520 --> 01:23:48.790 align:start position:0%
tapped as much as we could i mean i
think

01:23:48.790 --> 01:23:48.800 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:23:50.790 --> 01:23:50.800 align:start position:0%
to represent humber's point that there
 
01:23:53.990 --> 01:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
could be some additional assistance that
 
01:23:56.550 --> 01:23:56.560 align:start position:0%
hhs perhaps needed to employ to help
 
01:24:00.830 --> 01:24:00.840 align:start position:0%
them go through records i mean we would
 
01:24:03.830 --> 01:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
certainly work and try to identify
 
01:24:05.350 --> 01:24:05.360 align:start position:0%
any other option that wouldn't require
 
01:24:06.629 --> 01:24:06.639 align:start position:0%
spending your money out of the fund
 
01:24:07.910 --> 01:24:07.920 align:start position:0%
first but
 
01:24:10.709 --> 01:24:10.719 align:start position:0%
you know if we get a flood of of claims
 
01:24:12.550 --> 01:24:12.560 align:start position:0%
and we had to bring in some outside help
 
01:24:14.550 --> 01:24:14.560 align:start position:0%
on a temporary basis that would just
 
01:24:16.390 --> 01:24:16.400 align:start position:0%
leave that option open
 
01:24:17.990 --> 01:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
the other
 
01:24:20.070 --> 01:24:20.080 align:start position:0%
the other piece of this that is possible
 
01:24:23.030 --> 01:24:23.040 align:start position:0%
is that the the administrator has the
 
01:24:24.629 --> 01:24:24.639 align:start position:0%
option to employ
 
01:24:26.870 --> 01:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
staff and
 
01:24:28.950 --> 01:24:28.960 align:start position:0%
it could be and we'd have to work this
 
01:24:30.229 --> 01:24:30.239 align:start position:0%
out but it might be that the
 
01:24:33.430 --> 01:24:33.440 align:start position:0%
administrator perhaps might borrow
 
01:24:35.270 --> 01:24:35.280 align:start position:0%
staff from another
 
01:24:37.430 --> 01:24:37.440 align:start position:0%
agency but the fund would sort of would
 
01:24:39.910 --> 01:24:39.920 align:start position:0%
reimburse the agency for that staff's
 
01:24:41.669 --> 01:24:41.679 align:start position:0%
cost so it
 
01:24:43.590 --> 01:24:43.600 align:start position:0%
there are a couple of different things
 
01:24:45.030 --> 01:24:45.040 align:start position:0%
that could play out with something like
 
01:24:48.149 --> 01:24:48.159 align:start position:0%
that but we would of course try to
 
01:24:49.830 --> 01:24:49.840 align:start position:0%
to spend as little out of the fund as
 
01:24:51.430 --> 01:24:51.440 align:start position:0%
possible i can assure you that would be
 
01:24:54.149 --> 01:24:54.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:55.910 --> 01:24:55.920 align:start position:0%
go ahead follow up
 
01:24:57.910 --> 01:24:57.920 align:start position:0%
and i guess my follow-up question would
 
01:25:00.310 --> 01:25:00.320 align:start position:0%
be will there be an accounting
 
01:25:02.870 --> 01:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
of that separately so that we can see
 
01:25:04.790 --> 01:25:04.800 align:start position:0%
how much is coming out
 
01:25:04.800 --> 01:25:05.669 align:start position:0%
how much is coming out
and

01:25:05.669 --> 01:25:05.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:25:08.390 --> 01:25:08.400 align:start position:0%
in addition to that
 
01:25:08.400 --> 01:25:11.510 align:start position:0%
in addition to that
um

01:25:11.510 --> 01:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:12.870 --> 01:25:12.880 align:start position:0%
i mean you mentioned health and human
 
01:25:14.550 --> 01:25:14.560 align:start position:0%
services which i think
 
01:25:16.870 --> 01:25:16.880 align:start position:0%
probably backs into
 
01:25:18.310 --> 01:25:18.320 align:start position:0%
some of the things that were said in the
 
01:25:21.030 --> 01:25:21.040 align:start position:0%
original fiscal note
 
01:25:22.550 --> 01:25:22.560 align:start position:0%
and what i'm wondering is i mean that
 
01:25:25.189 --> 01:25:25.199 align:start position:0%
was an agency that had a 100 million
 
01:25:27.189 --> 01:25:27.199 align:start position:0%
laps last year
 
01:25:30.229 --> 01:25:30.239 align:start position:0%
so would you encourage them
 
01:25:33.669 --> 01:25:33.679 align:start position:0%
to look within their own means first
 
01:25:36.070 --> 01:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
before they came to this fund which is
 
01:25:38.870 --> 01:25:38.880 align:start position:0%
really a fun for victims
 
01:25:41.270 --> 01:25:41.280 align:start position:0%
yes absolutely i mean i'll just say it
 
01:25:42.629 --> 01:25:42.639 align:start position:0%
here in
 
01:25:45.990 --> 01:25:46.000 align:start position:0%
since since we're in session
 
01:25:47.910 --> 01:25:47.920 align:start position:0%
it would be my sincere hope we would not
 
01:25:48.950 --> 01:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
have to
 
01:25:50.950 --> 01:25:50.960 align:start position:0%
to tap this money for that purpose
 
01:25:53.030 --> 01:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
because to your point representative i
 
01:25:55.189 --> 01:25:55.199 align:start position:0%
think hhs should be able to identify
 
01:25:57.750 --> 01:25:57.760 align:start position:0%
resources within hhs or shift funding
 
01:26:00.870 --> 01:26:00.880 align:start position:0%
around within hhs to cover the need i
 
01:26:03.350 --> 01:26:03.360 align:start position:0%
think what this allows it's just
 
01:26:03.360 --> 01:26:04.870 align:start position:0%
think what this allows it's just
again

01:26:04.870 --> 01:26:04.880 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:26:06.950 --> 01:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
we can't predict the future you know god
 
01:26:09.110 --> 01:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
forbid we have another kovitz another
 
01:26:10.629 --> 01:26:10.639 align:start position:0%
covet surge or something and depending
 
01:26:12.950 --> 01:26:12.960 align:start position:0%
on what hhs is going through if we had
 
01:26:15.669 --> 01:26:15.679 align:start position:0%
to tap the fund to get him get him a
 
01:26:17.189 --> 01:26:17.199 align:start position:0%
little bit of temporary help to make
 
01:26:19.430 --> 01:26:19.440 align:start position:0%
sure we don't end up with a backlog of
 
01:26:21.350 --> 01:26:21.360 align:start position:0%
claims and have this process go off the
 
01:26:23.430 --> 01:26:23.440 align:start position:0%
rails that's really what this is for
 
01:26:25.510 --> 01:26:25.520 align:start position:0%
it's it's a fail-safe
 
01:26:26.790 --> 01:26:26.800 align:start position:0%
if you will
 
01:26:28.629 --> 01:26:28.639 align:start position:0%
but it i think it
 
01:26:30.629 --> 01:26:30.639 align:start position:0%
it makes sense to have it as a fail-safe
 
01:26:32.149 --> 01:26:32.159 align:start position:0%
even though we'll do everything we can
 
01:26:35.669 --> 01:26:35.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:35.679 --> 01:26:36.470 align:start position:0%
 
go it

01:26:36.470 --> 01:26:36.480 align:start position:0%
go it
 
01:26:39.030 --> 01:26:39.040 align:start position:0%
um thank you for um
 
01:26:41.910 --> 01:26:41.920 align:start position:0%
that and i do hope that you'll be very
 
01:26:43.830 --> 01:26:43.840 align:start position:0%
very careful about the use of these
 
01:26:45.030 --> 01:26:45.040 align:start position:0%
funds because
 
01:26:47.189 --> 01:26:47.199 align:start position:0%
they are the funds of the victims
 
01:26:50.229 --> 01:26:50.239 align:start position:0%
yes we will uh president walner i
 
01:26:51.990 --> 01:26:52.000 align:start position:0%
believe in here there's also a
 
01:26:53.669 --> 01:26:53.679 align:start position:0%
requirement for
 
01:26:56.149 --> 01:26:56.159 align:start position:0%
the ag to come to fiscal
 
01:26:58.950 --> 01:26:58.960 align:start position:0%
with their spent money is it every
 
01:27:02.790 --> 01:27:02.800 align:start position:0%
quarter yes quarterly reporting so
 
01:27:05.110 --> 01:27:05.120 align:start position:0%
they won't be privilegedly spending
 
01:27:05.120 --> 01:27:05.990 align:start position:0%
they won't be privilegedly spending
money

01:27:05.990 --> 01:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:07.430 align:start position:0%
money
okay

01:27:07.430 --> 01:27:07.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:27:09.110 --> 01:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
i'm glad to hear that
 
01:27:11.189 --> 01:27:11.199 align:start position:0%
so representative wallner uh we're gonna
 
01:27:12.470 --> 01:27:12.480 align:start position:0%
we're gonna be in here for another
 
01:27:14.390 --> 01:27:14.400 align:start position:0%
couple hours probably
 
01:27:16.950 --> 01:27:16.960 align:start position:0%
if if uh if you read
 
01:27:21.350 --> 01:27:21.360 align:start position:0%
lines 22 23 and 24 and and you
 
01:27:23.110 --> 01:27:23.120 align:start position:0%
want to parse the words slightly
 
01:27:24.870 --> 01:27:24.880 align:start position:0%
different and throw the word minimal
 
01:27:26.790 --> 01:27:26.800 align:start position:0%
minimally necessary or something in
 
01:27:29.830 --> 01:27:29.840 align:start position:0%
there i i i think we could consider that
 
01:27:31.750 --> 01:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
i don't think it changes what the intent
 
01:27:34.790 --> 01:27:34.800 align:start position:0%
of the ag is but it may be worth it if
 
01:27:39.270 --> 01:27:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:41.270 --> 01:27:41.280 align:start position:0%
no i think that the ag will be very
 
01:27:43.110 --> 01:27:43.120 align:start position:0%
careful with the funding
 
01:27:44.709 --> 01:27:44.719 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
01:27:48.070 --> 01:27:48.080 align:start position:0%
so so with that i think we've um can
 
01:27:51.110 --> 01:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
assume a consensus on the two bullet
 
01:27:53.030 --> 01:27:53.040 align:start position:0%
points on control and the reimbursement
 
01:27:55.030 --> 01:27:55.040 align:start position:0%
to other services uh representative
 
01:27:57.030 --> 01:27:57.040 align:start position:0%
wall's question yeah actually i want to
 
01:27:58.870 --> 01:27:58.880 align:start position:0%
go back and revisit something
 
01:28:00.950 --> 01:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
my understanding is let me move this
 
01:28:02.390 --> 01:28:02.400 align:start position:0%
over my understanding is this is a
 
01:28:04.070 --> 01:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
meeting of division one and division
 
01:28:05.990 --> 01:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
three yeah it just occurred to me
 
01:28:07.350 --> 01:28:07.360 align:start position:0%
afterwards that we've got people from
 
01:28:09.270 --> 01:28:09.280 align:start position:0%
division two counting
 
01:28:11.270 --> 01:28:11.280 align:start position:0%
voting i mean i'm sorry voting so we
 
01:28:13.110 --> 01:28:13.120 align:start position:0%
count their votes and i'm wondering how
 
01:28:14.709 --> 01:28:14.719 align:start position:0%
that works because
 
01:28:17.350 --> 01:28:17.360 align:start position:0%
not everybody from division two is here
 
01:28:19.189 --> 01:28:19.199 align:start position:0%
because they weren't on notice and i'm
 
01:28:21.270 --> 01:28:21.280 align:start position:0%
wondering why we're allowing
 
01:28:23.030 --> 01:28:23.040 align:start position:0%
this to be such a lopsided vote when
 
01:28:24.629 --> 01:28:24.639 align:start position:0%
people from division two are voting when
 
01:28:27.189 --> 01:28:27.199 align:start position:0%
this is not a division two hearing i i
 
01:28:29.430 --> 01:28:29.440 align:start position:0%
think that's a very fair observation one
 
01:28:32.709 --> 01:28:32.719 align:start position:0%
that escaped me um but it's in plain
 
01:28:33.990 --> 01:28:34.000 align:start position:0%
sight so
 
01:28:37.189 --> 01:28:37.199 align:start position:0%
so if you are a member of division two
 
01:28:40.229 --> 01:28:40.239 align:start position:0%
raise your hand please
 
01:28:42.709 --> 01:28:42.719 align:start position:0%
okay there's representative lynn
 
01:28:42.719 --> 01:28:43.910 align:start position:0%
okay there's representative lynn
and

01:28:43.910 --> 01:28:43.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:28:45.910 --> 01:28:45.920 align:start position:0%
go ahead representative
 
01:28:48.229 --> 01:28:48.239 align:start position:0%
yeah representative lin was asked to be
 
01:28:50.390 --> 01:28:50.400 align:start position:0%
on this committee by you
 
01:28:53.669 --> 01:28:53.679 align:start position:0%
as a voting member he was not put here
 
01:28:57.430 --> 01:28:57.440 align:start position:0%
because of him being on division two
 
01:29:01.189 --> 01:29:01.199 align:start position:0%
so he's been part of this group
 
01:29:01.199 --> 01:29:02.149 align:start position:0%
so he's been part of this group
okay

01:29:02.149 --> 01:29:02.159 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:29:02.159 --> 01:29:03.350 align:start position:0%
okay
and

01:29:03.350 --> 01:29:03.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:29:05.110 --> 01:29:05.120 align:start position:0%
i just happen to be the chairman of
 
01:29:05.120 --> 01:29:07.430 align:start position:0%
i just happen to be the chairman of
finance

01:29:07.430 --> 01:29:07.440 align:start position:0%
finance
 
01:29:08.830 --> 01:29:08.840 align:start position:0%
i don't have to vote
 
01:29:13.189 --> 01:29:13.199 align:start position:0%
but i felt i could as the chairman
 
01:29:14.470 --> 01:29:14.480 align:start position:0%
that i can
 
01:29:14.480 --> 01:29:16.070 align:start position:0%
that i can
vote

01:29:16.070 --> 01:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
vote
 
01:29:19.189 --> 01:29:19.199 align:start position:0%
on any of the committees so
 
01:29:19.199 --> 01:29:20.870 align:start position:0%
on any of the committees so
that's

01:29:20.870 --> 01:29:20.880 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:29:24.790 --> 01:29:24.800 align:start position:0%
but if it would make you feel better
 
01:29:26.870 --> 01:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
if it would make you feel better i don't
 
01:29:29.110 --> 01:29:29.120 align:start position:0%
have a problem not voting
 
01:29:29.120 --> 01:29:30.149 align:start position:0%
have a problem not voting
okay

01:29:30.149 --> 01:29:30.159 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:29:33.110 --> 01:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
it's so so can i make a request
 
01:29:34.870 --> 01:29:34.880 align:start position:0%
madam chair that
 
01:29:37.030 --> 01:29:37.040 align:start position:0%
for the purposes of these straw votes
 
01:29:39.750 --> 01:29:39.760 align:start position:0%
that representative lin and you
 
01:29:42.550 --> 01:29:42.560 align:start position:0%
don't vote but i want you to continue to
 
01:29:44.870 --> 01:29:44.880 align:start position:0%
actively participate with your opinions
 
01:29:46.709 --> 01:29:46.719 align:start position:0%
and questions and thoughts
 
01:29:49.830 --> 01:29:49.840 align:start position:0%
but but to represent a wall's vote i i
 
01:29:51.189 --> 01:29:51.199 align:start position:0%
don't want to make it look like we
 
01:29:55.350 --> 01:29:55.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:59.430 --> 01:29:59.440 align:start position:0%
so so let's revise the previous um 10 to
 
01:30:03.910 --> 01:30:03.920 align:start position:0%
or 10 to 5 vote to eight to five if we
 
01:30:07.110 --> 01:30:07.120 align:start position:0%
that's certainly fine with me all right
 
01:30:10.390 --> 01:30:10.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:14.870 --> 01:30:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:15.910 --> 01:30:15.920 align:start position:0%
it is
 
01:30:17.750 --> 01:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
for whatever reason the democrats did
 
01:30:20.070 --> 01:30:20.080 align:start position:0%
not get all the replacements for this
 
01:30:21.830 --> 01:30:21.840 align:start position:0%
today i i'm not sure people knew there
 
01:30:24.870 --> 01:30:24.880 align:start position:0%
was going to be voting um but it's it's
 
01:30:26.310 --> 01:30:26.320 align:start position:0%
it's the way the game is played so i
 
01:30:28.390 --> 01:30:28.400 align:start position:0%
think it's fair
 
01:30:29.990 --> 01:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
all right good thank you
 
01:30:33.350 --> 01:30:33.360 align:start position:0%
so so i'm going to try this a third run
 
01:30:36.470 --> 01:30:36.480 align:start position:0%
i i think we've now gone through uh mr
 
01:30:38.950 --> 01:30:38.960 align:start position:0%
hoffman's points on uh control of the
 
01:30:40.390 --> 01:30:40.400 align:start position:0%
fund's reimbursement to other
 
01:30:43.189 --> 01:30:43.199 align:start position:0%
departments and use of rainy day funds
 
01:30:45.110 --> 01:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
and that we're all in agreement with the
 
01:30:47.270 --> 01:30:47.280 align:start position:0%
language that he's incorporated as a
 
01:30:47.280 --> 01:30:49.750 align:start position:0%
language that he's incorporated as a
result

01:30:49.750 --> 01:30:49.760 align:start position:0%
result
 
01:30:49.760 --> 01:30:50.709 align:start position:0%
result
okay

01:30:50.709 --> 01:30:50.719 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:30:53.350 --> 01:30:53.360 align:start position:0%
so with that i think
 
01:30:56.709 --> 01:30:56.719 align:start position:0%
we're ready to move um go go ahead and
 
01:30:58.310 --> 01:30:58.320 align:start position:0%
represent emmerich
 
01:31:00.149 --> 01:31:00.159 align:start position:0%
yes i just wanted to we hit a glancing
 
01:31:04.229 --> 01:31:04.239 align:start position:0%
blow on page 2 lines 32 and 33
 
01:31:06.950 --> 01:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
having to do with the compensation
 
01:31:06.960 --> 01:31:08.470 align:start position:0%
having to do with the compensation
and

01:31:08.470 --> 01:31:08.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:31:10.870 --> 01:31:10.880 align:start position:0%
i i talked to it attorney ramsey about
 
01:31:12.390 --> 01:31:12.400 align:start position:0%
this last week
 
01:31:14.629 --> 01:31:14.639 align:start position:0%
and i think it would be
 
01:31:17.430 --> 01:31:17.440 align:start position:0%
better not to specify
 
01:31:18.950 --> 01:31:18.960 align:start position:0%
what the administrators to be paid
 
01:31:21.669 --> 01:31:21.679 align:start position:0%
because this is fixing the salary fixing
 
01:31:24.310 --> 01:31:24.320 align:start position:0%
the compensation and i i don't that
 
01:31:25.990 --> 01:31:26.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't give
 
01:31:28.629 --> 01:31:28.639 align:start position:0%
judicial any negotiating room
 
01:31:31.830 --> 01:31:31.840 align:start position:0%
so i i think that should be taken out as
 
01:31:33.590 --> 01:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
you're going through
 
01:31:36.390 --> 01:31:36.400 align:start position:0%
using retirees or not retirees i think
 
01:31:38.870 --> 01:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
the position should be defined as a 1099
 
01:31:41.669 --> 01:31:41.679 align:start position:0%
position which is how i understand it uh
 
01:31:43.590 --> 01:31:43.600 align:start position:0%
and so they're not going on the payroll
 
01:31:45.750 --> 01:31:45.760 align:start position:0%
as an employee they're a their
 
01:31:45.760 --> 01:31:47.750 align:start position:0%
as an employee they're a their
contractor

01:31:47.750 --> 01:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
contractor
 
01:31:50.950 --> 01:31:50.960 align:start position:0%
how that works with retirement i i'll
 
01:31:52.950 --> 01:31:52.960 align:start position:0%
i'll duck on that one
 
01:31:55.430 --> 01:31:55.440 align:start position:0%
but i do think you ought to take out
 
01:31:55.440 --> 01:31:56.229 align:start position:0%
but i do think you ought to take out
the

01:31:56.229 --> 01:31:56.239 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:31:58.229 --> 01:31:58.239 align:start position:0%
superior court justice compensation
 
01:32:00.390 --> 01:32:00.400 align:start position:0%
because that's now you've got a stake in
 
01:32:02.550 --> 01:32:02.560 align:start position:0%
the ground that
 
01:32:04.229 --> 01:32:04.239 align:start position:0%
negates any negotiation with an
 
01:32:04.239 --> 01:32:07.030 align:start position:0%
negates any negotiation with an
administrator

01:32:07.030 --> 01:32:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:09.110 --> 01:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
representative walls
 
01:32:12.229 --> 01:32:12.239 align:start position:0%
well to that end i would
 
01:32:14.870 --> 01:32:14.880 align:start position:0%
whether we use a judge of salary or not
 
01:32:16.629 --> 01:32:16.639 align:start position:0%
i'm less concerned about but i'd like
 
01:32:18.470 --> 01:32:18.480 align:start position:0%
something in there so that you could
 
01:32:20.950 --> 01:32:20.960 align:start position:0%
have a part-time person because this
 
01:32:22.950 --> 01:32:22.960 align:start position:0%
isn't going to be a full-time job all
 
01:32:25.270 --> 01:32:25.280 align:start position:0%
the way through the process can we defer
 
01:32:27.430 --> 01:32:27.440 align:start position:0%
that conversation because we that's
 
01:32:29.189 --> 01:32:29.199 align:start position:0%
specifically on the agenda where we're
 
01:32:31.430 --> 01:32:31.440 align:start position:0%
going to talk about the part-time aspect
 
01:32:33.750 --> 01:32:33.760 align:start position:0%
of this well it just i'd be happy to but
 
01:32:35.030 --> 01:32:35.040 align:start position:0%
i just want to say they seem to go
 
01:32:36.790 --> 01:32:36.800 align:start position:0%
together because if you've got a fixed
 
01:32:38.870 --> 01:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
judge's salary it's harder to do
 
01:32:41.350 --> 01:32:41.360 align:start position:0%
a part-time where if you take a
 
01:32:43.350 --> 01:32:43.360 align:start position:0%
part-time job and put it say i'm an
 
01:32:45.510 --> 01:32:45.520 align:start position:0%
hourly rate perhaps the same hourly rate
 
01:32:47.990 --> 01:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
that a full-time judge gets then you can
 
01:32:49.669 --> 01:32:49.679 align:start position:0%
have something that's more flexible with
 
01:32:51.350 --> 01:32:51.360 align:start position:0%
the needs of the job that's why i
 
01:32:53.350 --> 01:32:53.360 align:start position:0%
brought it up now
 
01:32:55.910 --> 01:32:55.920 align:start position:0%
thank you i i've never hired a judge or
 
01:32:57.990 --> 01:32:58.000 align:start position:0%
an administrator so i i'd like some
 
01:32:59.669 --> 01:32:59.679 align:start position:0%
advice from the person that's going to
 
01:33:01.110 --> 01:33:01.120 align:start position:0%
have to do it what what are your
 
01:33:07.350 --> 01:33:07.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:09.910 --> 01:33:09.920 align:start position:0%
thank you representative i
 
01:33:12.550 --> 01:33:12.560 align:start position:0%
i'm open to that concept i mean from a
 
01:33:14.550 --> 01:33:14.560 align:start position:0%
recommendation standpoint i i would
 
01:33:15.910 --> 01:33:15.920 align:start position:0%
recommend that
 
01:33:18.229 --> 01:33:18.239 align:start position:0%
perhaps we we
 
01:33:19.910 --> 01:33:19.920 align:start position:0%
do if you're willing to defer that
 
01:33:21.669 --> 01:33:21.679 align:start position:0%
discussion to when you walk through
 
01:33:23.590 --> 01:33:23.600 align:start position:0%
claimants council's points because i
 
01:33:25.510 --> 01:33:25.520 align:start position:0%
think they they kind of address that in
 
01:33:27.830 --> 01:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
one of their points
 
01:33:29.990 --> 01:33:30.000 align:start position:0%
either making the person part-time and i
 
01:33:31.910 --> 01:33:31.920 align:start position:0%
think as part of that to your point
 
01:33:34.390 --> 01:33:34.400 align:start position:0%
representative emerick i don't see any
 
01:33:37.590 --> 01:33:37.600 align:start position:0%
harm in say capping the compensation at
 
01:33:39.990 --> 01:33:40.000 align:start position:0%
what a superior court judge gets so that
 
01:33:43.189 --> 01:33:43.199 align:start position:0%
you're not paid more than that but
 
01:33:44.550 --> 01:33:44.560 align:start position:0%
if you're going to have potential for
 
01:33:46.229 --> 01:33:46.239 align:start position:0%
part time
 
01:33:48.149 --> 01:33:48.159 align:start position:0%
maybe making that a cap as opposed to
 
01:33:50.390 --> 01:33:50.400 align:start position:0%
designating that the salary then there's
 
01:33:53.750 --> 01:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
there's some room for negotiation
 
01:33:56.149 --> 01:33:56.159 align:start position:0%
so so if we followed your
 
01:33:57.590 --> 01:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
thought there
 
01:34:02.470 --> 01:34:02.480 align:start position:0%
we'd be modifying line 32 on page two
 
01:34:05.030 --> 01:34:05.040 align:start position:0%
and we'd be modifying where it says
 
01:34:08.550 --> 01:34:08.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:08.560 --> 01:34:09.510 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:34:09.510 --> 01:34:09.520 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:34:12.629 --> 01:34:12.639 align:start position:0%
that it would be capped at no more than
 
01:34:14.870 --> 01:34:14.880 align:start position:0%
the salary yes
 
01:34:14.880 --> 01:34:15.830 align:start position:0%
the salary yes
okay

01:34:15.830 --> 01:34:15.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:34:19.830 --> 01:34:19.840 align:start position:0%
do do you have that mr ripple okay good
 
01:34:21.510 --> 01:34:21.520 align:start position:0%
any further discussion on that we will
 
01:34:26.550 --> 01:34:26.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:28.870 --> 01:34:28.880 align:start position:0%
the way it is now the uh
 
01:34:30.950 --> 01:34:30.960 align:start position:0%
there is a judicial retirement system
 
01:34:33.110 --> 01:34:33.120 align:start position:0%
once you're into it you can't
 
01:34:35.189 --> 01:34:35.199 align:start position:0%
decide to go and do further work that
 
01:34:37.189 --> 01:34:37.199 align:start position:0%
isn't entered into that
 
01:34:37.199 --> 01:34:38.470 align:start position:0%
isn't entered into that
and

01:34:38.470 --> 01:34:38.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:34:40.709 --> 01:34:40.719 align:start position:0%
the judges have to contribute 10 i
 
01:34:42.870 --> 01:34:42.880 align:start position:0%
believe it is to the to the retirement
 
01:34:44.550 --> 01:34:44.560 align:start position:0%
system and the retirement system
 
01:34:46.870 --> 01:34:46.880 align:start position:0%
contributes the same and there's there's
 
01:34:48.790 --> 01:34:48.800 align:start position:0%
a pool of money there that's it's there
 
01:34:48.800 --> 01:34:49.510 align:start position:0%
a pool of money there that's it's there
is

01:34:49.510 --> 01:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:34:51.350 --> 01:34:51.360 align:start position:0%
and i think that's fairly stable in that
 
01:34:53.830 --> 01:34:53.840 align:start position:0%
one but so if if someone
 
01:34:55.350 --> 01:34:55.360 align:start position:0%
is hired at a
 
01:34:57.270 --> 01:34:57.280 align:start position:0%
judge's salary they don't have to
 
01:34:58.950 --> 01:34:58.960 align:start position:0%
contribute to 10 but they don't have the
 
01:34:58.960 --> 01:35:00.950 align:start position:0%
contribute to 10 but they don't have the
10

01:35:00.950 --> 01:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
10
 
01:35:02.629 --> 01:35:02.639 align:start position:0%
contribution going into the retirement
 
01:35:03.910 --> 01:35:03.920 align:start position:0%
system either
 
01:35:03.920 --> 01:35:04.709 align:start position:0%
system either
so

01:35:04.709 --> 01:35:04.719 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:35:06.709 --> 01:35:06.719 align:start position:0%
there's some adjustment there to figure
 
01:35:07.910 --> 01:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
out well
 
01:35:09.109 --> 01:35:09.119 align:start position:0%
you're winning and you're losing on
 
01:35:10.629 --> 01:35:10.639 align:start position:0%
those deals so
 
01:35:16.310 --> 01:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:19.189 --> 01:35:19.199 align:start position:0%
oh okay so representative
 
01:35:21.030 --> 01:35:21.040 align:start position:0%
are you satisfied with what we just did
 
01:35:21.040 --> 01:35:23.109 align:start position:0%
are you satisfied with what we just did
there

01:35:23.109 --> 01:35:23.119 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:35:25.109 --> 01:35:25.119 align:start position:0%
all right so at this point we should
 
01:35:28.550 --> 01:35:28.560 align:start position:0%
invite uh the victim's counsel up
 
01:35:30.709 --> 01:35:30.719 align:start position:0%
mr formella thank you for coming up and
 
01:35:32.550 --> 01:35:32.560 align:start position:0%
there'll be more
 
01:35:35.669 --> 01:35:35.679 align:start position:0%
i think mr don beard
 
01:35:41.350 --> 01:35:41.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:43.910 --> 01:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
oh i i was told mr
 
01:35:46.070 --> 01:35:46.080 align:start position:0%
vinci on joe which was a great relief
 
01:35:48.709 --> 01:35:48.719 align:start position:0%
wasn't going to be here today
 
01:35:50.870 --> 01:35:50.880 align:start position:0%
and and the don would be because you
 
01:35:52.709 --> 01:35:52.719 align:start position:0%
can't see yeah because i can't say his
 
01:35:55.510 --> 01:35:55.520 align:start position:0%
name is really is what it is
 
01:35:55.520 --> 01:35:56.550 align:start position:0%
name is really is what it is
so

01:35:56.550 --> 01:35:56.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:35:58.790 --> 01:35:58.800 align:start position:0%
so you're you're here to to represent
 
01:36:02.790 --> 01:36:02.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:05.430 --> 01:36:05.440 align:start position:0%
oh fantastic mr chairman uh and thank
 
01:36:07.510 --> 01:36:07.520 align:start position:0%
you yeah and so we brought two people
 
01:36:08.950 --> 01:36:08.960 align:start position:0%
give you two names
 
01:36:11.430 --> 01:36:11.440 align:start position:0%

we
 
01:36:50.229 --> 01:36:50.239 align:start position:0%
as you see in front of you we
 
01:36:52.390 --> 01:36:52.400 align:start position:0%
focused our
 
01:36:54.070 --> 01:36:54.080 align:start position:0%
comments to
 
01:36:54.080 --> 01:36:54.870 align:start position:0%
comments to
the

01:36:54.870 --> 01:36:54.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:36:56.950 --> 01:36:56.960 align:start position:0%
to the draft the last the attorney
 
01:36:59.510 --> 01:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
general's last recommended amendment
 
01:37:02.310 --> 01:37:02.320 align:start position:0%
as a way of sharpening the focus
 
01:37:05.350 --> 01:37:05.360 align:start position:0%
for this meeting i would say
 
01:37:07.590 --> 01:37:07.600 align:start position:0%
i don't mean to abandon the issues that
 
01:37:09.590 --> 01:37:09.600 align:start position:0%
dave has raised before but i don't mean
 
01:37:11.430 --> 01:37:11.440 align:start position:0%
to repeat them here
 
01:37:13.189 --> 01:37:13.199 align:start position:0%
and we have
 
01:37:14.229 --> 01:37:14.239 align:start position:0%
we have
 
01:37:16.550 --> 01:37:16.560 align:start position:0%
stated our position very clearly in
 
01:37:18.870 --> 01:37:18.880 align:start position:0%
relation to expanding the full scope of
 
01:37:20.390 --> 01:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:37:22.149 --> 01:37:22.159 align:start position:0%
and there's an amendment that could be
 
01:37:24.149 --> 01:37:24.159 align:start position:0%
considered if you were to go down that
 
01:37:26.709 --> 01:37:26.719 align:start position:0%
road based on a prior draft but for
 
01:37:29.430 --> 01:37:29.440 align:start position:0%
today for today we're going to focus on
 
01:37:31.669 --> 01:37:31.679 align:start position:0%
specific provisions of the bill
 
01:37:33.590 --> 01:37:33.600 align:start position:0%
um that we haven't
 
01:37:36.229 --> 01:37:36.239 align:start position:0%
that uh that seem to be in front of you
 
01:37:38.550 --> 01:37:38.560 align:start position:0%
um i don't have an opinion about the
 
01:37:41.189 --> 01:37:41.199 align:start position:0%
changes previously discussed uh relating
 
01:37:43.830 --> 01:37:43.840 align:start position:0%
to the rainy day fund uh we weren't
 
01:37:45.590 --> 01:37:45.600 align:start position:0%
really prepared to think about that
 
01:37:45.600 --> 01:37:46.870 align:start position:0%
really prepared to think about that
today

01:37:46.870 --> 01:37:46.880 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:37:49.030 --> 01:37:49.040 align:start position:0%
but certainly as i listen to comments
 
01:37:49.040 --> 01:37:50.310 align:start position:0%
but certainly as i listen to comments
about

01:37:50.310 --> 01:37:50.320 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:37:53.030 --> 01:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
the attorney general
 
01:37:55.350 --> 01:37:55.360 align:start position:0%
controlling funds
 
01:37:56.870 --> 01:37:56.880 align:start position:0%
i i don't know where to come down on
 
01:37:59.750 --> 01:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
that issue but i can i just want to
 
01:38:01.669 --> 01:38:01.679 align:start position:0%
remind the committee that you know every
 
01:38:03.270 --> 01:38:03.280 align:start position:0%
day that we do
 
01:38:05.350 --> 01:38:05.360 align:start position:0%
this bill does things like that you know
 
01:38:07.510 --> 01:38:07.520 align:start position:0%
the question really is going to become
 
01:38:09.430 --> 01:38:09.440 align:start position:0%
whether you're actually establishing a
 
01:38:09.440 --> 01:38:10.950 align:start position:0%
whether you're actually establishing a
trauma-informed

01:38:10.950 --> 01:38:10.960 align:start position:0%
trauma-informed
 
01:38:13.189 --> 01:38:13.199 align:start position:0%
victor senate alternative to litigation
 
01:38:13.199 --> 01:38:14.550 align:start position:0%
victor senate alternative to litigation
because

01:38:14.550 --> 01:38:14.560 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:38:16.149 --> 01:38:16.159 align:start position:0%
it's where clear that we think this
 
01:38:18.470 --> 01:38:18.480 align:start position:0%
should be a process is inviting to every
 
01:38:21.750 --> 01:38:21.760 align:start position:0%
victim not just a select few
 
01:38:21.760 --> 01:38:22.709 align:start position:0%
victim not just a select few
um

01:38:22.709 --> 01:38:22.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:22.719 --> 01:38:23.590 align:start position:0%
um
and

01:38:23.590 --> 01:38:23.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:38:25.350 --> 01:38:25.360 align:start position:0%
with that
 
01:38:28.629 --> 01:38:28.639 align:start position:0%
as you'll see on our summary we have uh
 
01:38:31.350 --> 01:38:31.360 align:start position:0%
two points relating to the physical
 
01:38:31.360 --> 01:38:32.470 align:start position:0%
two points relating to the physical
abuse

01:38:32.470 --> 01:38:32.480 align:start position:0%
abuse
 
01:38:32.480 --> 01:38:33.830 align:start position:0%
abuse
definition

01:38:33.830 --> 01:38:33.840 align:start position:0%
definition
 
01:38:36.870 --> 01:38:36.880 align:start position:0%
that was added to
 
01:38:41.189 --> 01:38:41.199 align:start position:0%
to added to the draft last go-around and
 
01:38:43.430 --> 01:38:43.440 align:start position:0%
for that i'm going to ask dan to
 
01:38:43.440 --> 01:38:44.470 align:start position:0%
for that i'm going to ask dan to
explain

01:38:44.470 --> 01:38:44.480 align:start position:0%
explain
 
01:38:47.590 --> 01:38:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:49.669 --> 01:38:49.679 align:start position:0%
you know i i want to hear you i just
 
01:38:51.830 --> 01:38:51.840 align:start position:0%
want to make sure i'm following in in
 
01:38:53.830 --> 01:38:53.840 align:start position:0%
writing exactly where we are and what
 
01:38:56.790 --> 01:38:56.800 align:start position:0%
we're looking at i i i see your redline
 
01:38:58.629 --> 01:38:58.639 align:start position:0%
version are we off of your redline
 
01:39:01.750 --> 01:39:01.760 align:start position:0%
version or are we off of the last
 
01:39:04.870 --> 01:39:04.880 align:start position:0%
official version the committee used
 
01:39:06.790 --> 01:39:06.800 align:start position:0%
we we're working off of our redline
 
01:39:10.070 --> 01:39:10.080 align:start position:0%
version we we didn't have that uh
 
01:39:12.790 --> 01:39:12.800 align:start position:0%
okay so so in this in this example on
 
01:39:16.870 --> 01:39:16.880 align:start position:0%
line 36 you added a single incident of
 
01:39:19.350 --> 01:39:19.360 align:start position:0%
for example is that where we are yes
 
01:39:21.189 --> 01:39:21.199 align:start position:0%
that's right okay i won't interrupt you
 
01:39:21.199 --> 01:39:22.149 align:start position:0%
that's right okay i won't interrupt you
further

01:39:22.149 --> 01:39:22.159 align:start position:0%
further
 
01:39:23.830 --> 01:39:23.840 align:start position:0%
okay uh so
 
01:39:23.840 --> 01:39:25.430 align:start position:0%
okay uh so
and

01:39:25.430 --> 01:39:25.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:39:27.350 --> 01:39:27.360 align:start position:0%
i'm actually going to talk kind of in
 
01:39:29.510 --> 01:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
conjunction about both the first two
 
01:39:29.520 --> 01:39:30.629 align:start position:0%
conjunction about both the first two
points

01:39:30.629 --> 01:39:30.639 align:start position:0%
points
 
01:39:32.709 --> 01:39:32.719 align:start position:0%
because there are similar reasons for
 
01:39:34.229 --> 01:39:34.239 align:start position:0%
these changes it's both to the
 
01:39:37.030 --> 01:39:37.040 align:start position:0%
definition of physical abuse and
 
01:39:38.550 --> 01:39:38.560 align:start position:0%
sexual abuse
 
01:39:40.870 --> 01:39:40.880 align:start position:0%
uh and you know as jim said we're not
 
01:39:42.229 --> 01:39:42.239 align:start position:0%
going to repeat all the kind of core
 
01:39:44.950 --> 01:39:44.960 align:start position:0%
principles that david had uh had told
 
01:39:46.870 --> 01:39:46.880 align:start position:0%
you about in prior meetings but you know
 
01:39:49.270 --> 01:39:49.280 align:start position:0%
this goes to that kind of core principle
 
01:39:51.350 --> 01:39:51.360 align:start position:0%
of of covering everyone and being
 
01:39:53.910 --> 01:39:53.920 align:start position:0%
comprehensive with a alternative dispute
 
01:39:56.550 --> 01:39:56.560 align:start position:0%
resolution process and we think that's
 
01:39:58.229 --> 01:39:58.239 align:start position:0%
you know in the claim its best interest
 
01:40:00.550 --> 01:40:00.560 align:start position:0%
and also in the state's
 
01:40:03.189 --> 01:40:03.199 align:start position:0%
interest to resolve to the extent it can
 
01:40:04.790 --> 01:40:04.800 align:start position:0%
to resolve these claims through this
 
01:40:07.270 --> 01:40:07.280 align:start position:0%
process and not have a situation
 
01:40:08.709 --> 01:40:08.719 align:start position:0%
not only where you're discriminating
 
01:40:11.510 --> 01:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
against some members of this class but
 
01:40:13.430 --> 01:40:13.440 align:start position:0%
there are possibly cases that we
 
01:40:16.310 --> 01:40:16.320 align:start position:0%
identify in here i can give an example
 
01:40:19.189 --> 01:40:19.199 align:start position:0%
where you could have a a survivor who is
 
01:40:21.830 --> 01:40:21.840 align:start position:0%
both making claims under this process
 
01:40:23.990 --> 01:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
but is also being denied
 
01:40:25.430 --> 01:40:25.440 align:start position:0%
even though the claim might itself be
 
01:40:27.990 --> 01:40:28.000 align:start position:0%
valid in court and so they have to then
 
01:40:29.669 --> 01:40:29.679 align:start position:0%
uh you know they might get a settlement
 
01:40:31.030 --> 01:40:31.040 align:start position:0%
out of this process but then they still
 
01:40:32.950 --> 01:40:32.960 align:start position:0%
have to go to court
 
01:40:34.709 --> 01:40:34.719 align:start position:0%
because some of their claims are not
 
01:40:36.790 --> 01:40:36.800 align:start position:0%
covered by this um
 
01:40:38.470 --> 01:40:38.480 align:start position:0%
and and so that's why you know and and
 
01:40:40.070 --> 01:40:40.080 align:start position:0%
the other thing that i'll i'll point out
 
01:40:43.030 --> 01:40:43.040 align:start position:0%
too is that you know you've you can see
 
01:40:45.910 --> 01:40:45.920 align:start position:0%
in the revision we've made on both
 
01:40:47.990 --> 01:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
physical abuse and sexual abuse as we've
 
01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:48.870 align:start position:0%
physical abuse and sexual abuse as we've
added

01:40:48.870 --> 01:40:48.880 align:start position:0%
added
 
01:40:51.669 --> 01:40:51.679 align:start position:0%
reference to the common law definition
 
01:40:51.679 --> 01:40:52.550 align:start position:0%
reference to the common law definition
of

01:40:52.550 --> 01:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:40:54.629 --> 01:40:54.639 align:start position:0%
assault and battery for the physical
 
01:40:54.639 --> 01:40:56.070 align:start position:0%
assault and battery for the physical
abuse

01:40:56.070 --> 01:40:56.080 align:start position:0%
abuse
 
01:40:57.430 --> 01:40:57.440 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:40:59.109 --> 01:40:59.119 align:start position:0%
for assault
 
01:41:01.270 --> 01:41:01.280 align:start position:0%
and then referencing the criminal
 
01:41:01.280 --> 01:41:02.550 align:start position:0%
and then referencing the criminal
definitions

01:41:02.550 --> 01:41:02.560 align:start position:0%
definitions
 
01:41:04.470 --> 01:41:04.480 align:start position:0%
for um
 
01:41:08.390 --> 01:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
sexual contact and sexual penetration
 
01:41:08.400 --> 01:41:09.270 align:start position:0%
sexual contact and sexual penetration
uh

01:41:09.270 --> 01:41:09.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:41:09.280 --> 01:41:10.629 align:start position:0%
uh
so

01:41:10.629 --> 01:41:10.639 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:41:12.870 --> 01:41:12.880 align:start position:0%
the theme here is
 
01:41:14.790 --> 01:41:14.800 align:start position:0%
what the state wants to get out of this
 
01:41:18.070 --> 01:41:18.080 align:start position:0%
process besides trying to make these
 
01:41:20.790 --> 01:41:20.800 align:start position:0%
survivors whole again or give them some
 
01:41:20.800 --> 01:41:22.709 align:start position:0%
survivors whole again or give them some
compensation

01:41:22.709 --> 01:41:22.719 align:start position:0%
compensation
 
01:41:24.390 --> 01:41:24.400 align:start position:0%
is at the end of the day to get a
 
01:41:26.390 --> 01:41:26.400 align:start position:0%
release of civil claims and civil
 
01:41:29.189 --> 01:41:29.199 align:start position:0%
liability so we think it is important
 
01:41:31.109 --> 01:41:31.119 align:start position:0%
that the concept of civil laws
 
01:41:33.030 --> 01:41:33.040 align:start position:0%
incorporated and not just we're not just
 
01:41:34.709 --> 01:41:34.719 align:start position:0%
focusing on
 
01:41:37.669 --> 01:41:37.679 align:start position:0%
criminal statutes
 
01:41:37.679 --> 01:41:40.790 align:start position:0%
criminal statutes
so

01:41:40.790 --> 01:41:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:43.350 --> 01:41:43.360 align:start position:0%
let me give you the example
 
01:41:45.350 --> 01:41:45.360 align:start position:0%
that i think really points out the issue
 
01:41:47.030 --> 01:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
that we have especially on
 
01:41:49.430 --> 01:41:49.440 align:start position:0%
the sexual abuse definition
 
01:41:51.350 --> 01:41:51.360 align:start position:0%
so the attorney general's proposal and
 
01:41:53.750 --> 01:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
we understand why they did it this way
 
01:41:55.430 --> 01:41:55.440 align:start position:0%
they wanted to make it
 
01:41:58.070 --> 01:41:58.080 align:start position:0%
fairly narrow to address this specific
 
01:41:59.669 --> 01:41:59.679 align:start position:0%
situation their sexual assaults
 
01:42:01.830 --> 01:42:01.840 align:start position:0%
occurring in a juvenile detention
 
01:42:04.950 --> 01:42:04.960 align:start position:0%
facility but it it just cuts too too
 
01:42:07.510 --> 01:42:07.520 align:start position:0%
thinly it slices too thinly
 
01:42:09.189 --> 01:42:09.199 align:start position:0%
and i think we saw evidence of some of
 
01:42:11.510 --> 01:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
the complications that causes
 
01:42:13.350 --> 01:42:13.360 align:start position:0%
during the last hearing when
 
01:42:15.189 --> 01:42:15.199 align:start position:0%
representative lin had some concerns
 
01:42:17.030 --> 01:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
about the carve out they had to make
 
01:42:18.709 --> 01:42:18.719 align:start position:0%
that was caused by the fact that their
 
01:42:20.870 --> 01:42:20.880 align:start position:0%
their slicing was so thin
 
01:42:20.880 --> 01:42:22.950 align:start position:0%
their slicing was so thin
so

01:42:22.950 --> 01:42:22.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:42:26.229 --> 01:42:26.239 align:start position:0%
the example i'll give you is
 
01:42:28.149 --> 01:42:28.159 align:start position:0%
supposing there's a 12 year old that's
 
01:42:31.590 --> 01:42:31.600 align:start position:0%
detained at the the at the ydc and they
 
01:42:31.600 --> 01:42:32.709 align:start position:0%
detained at the the at the ydc and they
are

01:42:32.709 --> 01:42:32.719 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:42:34.629 --> 01:42:34.639 align:start position:0%
physically assaulted thrown to the floor
 
01:42:37.910 --> 01:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
and and raped by a janitor
 
01:42:40.790 --> 01:42:40.800 align:start position:0%
that is going to cause an issue
 
01:42:43.430 --> 01:42:43.440 align:start position:0%
when uh the administrator has this case
 
01:42:45.109 --> 01:42:45.119 align:start position:0%
uh the administrator's gonna have to
 
01:42:46.070 --> 01:42:46.080 align:start position:0%
look at
 
01:42:48.950 --> 01:42:48.960 align:start position:0%
well uh did this person have direct
 
01:42:51.189 --> 01:42:51.199 align:start position:0%
supervisory authority
 
01:42:53.189 --> 01:42:53.199 align:start position:0%
over this victim they're the janitor
 
01:42:54.390 --> 01:42:54.400 align:start position:0%
they're not a guard they're not a
 
01:42:54.400 --> 01:42:57.430 align:start position:0%
they're not a guard they're not a
counselor

01:42:57.430 --> 01:42:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:57.440 --> 01:42:58.870 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:42:58.870 --> 01:42:58.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:43:02.550 --> 01:43:02.560 align:start position:0%
when you look at the the statute 632
 
01:43:02.560 --> 01:43:03.669 align:start position:0%
when you look at the the statute 632
a2

01:43:03.669 --> 01:43:03.679 align:start position:0%
a2
 
01:43:05.430 --> 01:43:05.440 align:start position:0%
so for felonious
 
01:43:07.030 --> 01:43:07.040 align:start position:0%
sexual assault
 
01:43:07.040 --> 01:43:10.070 align:start position:0%
sexual assault
632-a-2

01:43:10.070 --> 01:43:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:13.189 --> 01:43:13.199 align:start position:0%
if you have a brutal rape of somebody
 
01:43:15.109 --> 01:43:15.119 align:start position:0%
that's 12 years old that is very easily
 
01:43:17.750 --> 01:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
covered by several provisions
 
01:43:19.830 --> 01:43:19.840 align:start position:0%
of the statute including the very first
 
01:43:21.270 --> 01:43:21.280 align:start position:0%
provision which is
 
01:43:23.350 --> 01:43:23.360 align:start position:0%
when a perpetrator overcomes the victim
 
01:43:25.510 --> 01:43:25.520 align:start position:0%
through actual application of physical
 
01:43:28.310 --> 01:43:28.320 align:start position:0%
force and physical violence and also
 
01:43:30.070 --> 01:43:30.080 align:start position:0%
subsection l
 
01:43:31.910 --> 01:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
when the victim is less than 13 years
 
01:43:34.229 --> 01:43:34.239 align:start position:0%
old but instead we're asking the
 
01:43:36.550 --> 01:43:36.560 align:start position:0%
claimant in this in this process
 
01:43:38.550 --> 01:43:38.560 align:start position:0%
to have to prove n
 
01:43:40.550 --> 01:43:40.560 align:start position:0%
that the that the perpetrator was in a
 
01:43:43.189 --> 01:43:43.199 align:start position:0%
position of authority over the victim
 
01:43:45.030 --> 01:43:45.040 align:start position:0%
and use that authority
 
01:43:48.470 --> 01:43:48.480 align:start position:0%
uh to perpetrate the rate the the rape
 
01:43:50.870 --> 01:43:50.880 align:start position:0%
uh and even goes further than that when
 
01:43:53.510 --> 01:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
the actor has direct supervisory
 
01:43:55.350 --> 01:43:55.360 align:start position:0%
disciplinary or other authority
 
01:43:58.390 --> 01:43:58.400 align:start position:0%
authorized by law so these are
 
01:44:00.310 --> 01:44:00.320 align:start position:0%
this is adding elements and complexity
 
01:44:03.109 --> 01:44:03.119 align:start position:0%
to the process for
 
01:44:05.270 --> 01:44:05.280 align:start position:0%
for reasons that we don't understand and
 
01:44:15.109 --> 01:44:15.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:16.229 --> 01:44:16.239 align:start position:0%
so um
 
01:44:18.070 --> 01:44:18.080 align:start position:0%
and you know kind of returning to my my
 
01:44:21.189 --> 01:44:21.199 align:start position:0%
previous point at the end of the end of
 
01:44:23.189 --> 01:44:23.199 align:start position:0%
the day we're looking for a release of
 
01:44:25.750 --> 01:44:25.760 align:start position:0%
civil claims if this claimant
 
01:44:27.750 --> 01:44:27.760 align:start position:0%
goes to court
 
01:44:30.229 --> 01:44:30.239 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't have to prove
 
01:44:32.149 --> 01:44:32.159 align:start position:0%
this whole you know supervisory
 
01:44:34.470 --> 01:44:34.480 align:start position:0%
authority piece of this they would just
 
01:44:36.470 --> 01:44:36.480 align:start position:0%
prove i was physically assaulted and
 
01:44:36.480 --> 01:44:37.590 align:start position:0%
prove i was physically assaulted and
raped

01:44:37.590 --> 01:44:37.600 align:start position:0%
raped
 
01:44:39.750 --> 01:44:39.760 align:start position:0%
so um you know we we think this process
 
01:44:41.590 --> 01:44:41.600 align:start position:0%
should mirror
 
01:44:43.910 --> 01:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
you know what would happen in court if
 
01:44:45.030 --> 01:44:45.040 align:start position:0%
you're going to get a release of
 
01:44:45.040 --> 01:44:46.830 align:start position:0%
you're going to get a release of
liability

01:44:46.830 --> 01:44:46.840 align:start position:0%
liability
 
01:44:46.840 --> 01:44:48.470 align:start position:0%
liability
um

01:44:48.470 --> 01:44:48.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:51.350 --> 01:44:51.360 align:start position:0%
and you know as i mentioned before
 
01:44:53.830 --> 01:44:53.840 align:start position:0%
you could have the same claimant that
 
01:44:56.950 --> 01:44:56.960 align:start position:0%
has multiple claims so and and and we've
 
01:44:58.470 --> 01:44:58.480 align:start position:0%
seen this in the files that we've looked
 
01:45:00.629 --> 01:45:00.639 align:start position:0%
at we've we have claimants
 
01:45:02.870 --> 01:45:02.880 align:start position:0%
that are assaulted
 
01:45:04.790 --> 01:45:04.800 align:start position:0%
and raped by multiple different people
 
01:45:06.550 --> 01:45:06.560 align:start position:0%
in multiple different positions within
 
01:45:07.990 --> 01:45:08.000 align:start position:0%
the ydc
 
01:45:09.910 --> 01:45:09.920 align:start position:0%
so there could be examples where you
 
01:45:11.350 --> 01:45:11.360 align:start position:0%
have somebody that
 
01:45:12.790 --> 01:45:12.800 align:start position:0%
wants to go through this process and
 
01:45:14.070 --> 01:45:14.080 align:start position:0%
they're able to resolve some of their
 
01:45:14.080 --> 01:45:15.109 align:start position:0%
they're able to resolve some of their
claims

01:45:15.109 --> 01:45:15.119 align:start position:0%
claims
 
01:45:17.030 --> 01:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
but they have other claims that they
 
01:45:19.189 --> 01:45:19.199 align:start position:0%
they have to go to court to resolve
 
01:45:21.109 --> 01:45:21.119 align:start position:0%
and that would seem to defeat the
 
01:45:24.709 --> 01:45:24.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:26.709 --> 01:45:26.719 align:start position:0%
let me check in with the representative
 
01:45:29.350 --> 01:45:29.360 align:start position:0%
lin here a second um in an earlier
 
01:45:31.510 --> 01:45:31.520 align:start position:0%
conversation you were trying to educate
 
01:45:34.390 --> 01:45:34.400 align:start position:0%
me about the foss language
 
01:45:37.030 --> 01:45:37.040 align:start position:0%
is is the substitute language that you
 
01:45:38.709 --> 01:45:38.719 align:start position:0%
developed around
 
01:45:40.390 --> 01:45:40.400 align:start position:0%
that applicable
 
01:45:40.400 --> 01:45:41.350 align:start position:0%
that applicable
here

01:45:41.350 --> 01:45:41.360 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:45:45.510 --> 01:45:45.520 align:start position:0%
on on these particular lines i yes i
 
01:45:47.910 --> 01:45:47.920 align:start position:0%
mean i think i think generally
 
01:45:49.510 --> 01:45:49.520 align:start position:0%
i don't have
 
01:45:52.390 --> 01:45:52.400 align:start position:0%
a particular problem with what what
 
01:45:54.550 --> 01:45:54.560 align:start position:0%
council is saying here with with the
 
01:45:55.910 --> 01:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
exception that
 
01:45:55.920 --> 01:45:56.629 align:start position:0%
exception that
he

01:45:56.629 --> 01:45:56.639 align:start position:0%
he
 
01:45:58.870 --> 01:45:58.880 align:start position:0%
my problem was was carving out that
 
01:45:58.880 --> 01:46:00.310 align:start position:0%
my problem was was carving out that
exception

01:46:00.310 --> 01:46:00.320 align:start position:0%
exception
 
01:46:03.669 --> 01:46:03.679 align:start position:0%
for the with the false language and
 
01:46:06.470 --> 01:46:06.480 align:start position:0%
i i note that in in his proposal he can
 
01:46:08.629 --> 01:46:08.639 align:start position:0%
you he continues to leave the false
 
01:46:11.109 --> 01:46:11.119 align:start position:0%
language in there which would
 
01:46:13.750 --> 01:46:13.760 align:start position:0%
carve out that exception which i i think
 
01:46:15.030 --> 01:46:15.040 align:start position:0%
would make the
 
01:46:16.950 --> 01:46:16.960 align:start position:0%
make the
 
01:46:20.149 --> 01:46:20.159 align:start position:0%
the state's liability too broad but i do
 
01:46:22.950 --> 01:46:22.960 align:start position:0%
agree with him and in fact the way i had
 
01:46:24.790 --> 01:46:24.800 align:start position:0%
proposed to cover
 
01:46:26.629 --> 01:46:26.639 align:start position:0%
the situation that the attorney general
 
01:46:26.639 --> 01:46:27.669 align:start position:0%
the situation that the attorney general
had

01:46:27.669 --> 01:46:27.679 align:start position:0%
had
 
01:46:30.550 --> 01:46:30.560 align:start position:0%
adopted or i had pointed out was to was
 
01:46:32.629 --> 01:46:32.639 align:start position:0%
to say that it could be a common law
 
01:46:35.990 --> 01:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
claim it could be a common law claim
 
01:46:38.870 --> 01:46:38.880 align:start position:0%
for civil sexual assault so i think
 
01:46:41.350 --> 01:46:41.360 align:start position:0%
generally i don't have a problem but i i
 
01:46:42.310 --> 01:46:42.320 align:start position:0%
i would
 
01:46:45.189 --> 01:46:45.199 align:start position:0%
i would still take out the reference to
 
01:46:48.149 --> 01:46:48.159 align:start position:0%
accepting state versus foss
 
01:46:48.159 --> 01:46:49.510 align:start position:0%
accepting state versus foss
um

01:46:49.510 --> 01:46:49.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:51.350 --> 01:46:51.360 align:start position:0%
representative actually i agree with you
 
01:46:52.950 --> 01:46:52.960 align:start position:0%
on that i i think
 
01:46:55.030 --> 01:46:55.040 align:start position:0%
if the other changes are are made that
 
01:46:56.790 --> 01:46:56.800 align:start position:0%
we've requested i think we're fine with
 
01:46:58.790 --> 01:46:58.800 align:start position:0%
striking that's it's kind of redundant
 
01:46:58.800 --> 01:46:59.669 align:start position:0%
striking that's it's kind of redundant
to

01:46:59.669 --> 01:46:59.679 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:47:01.270 --> 01:47:01.280 align:start position:0%
to have that language it's it's not
 
01:47:03.910 --> 01:47:03.920 align:start position:0%
necessary okay
 
01:47:05.830 --> 01:47:05.840 align:start position:0%
yeah so i mean i would be okay now
 
01:47:05.840 --> 01:47:06.790 align:start position:0%
yeah so i mean i would be okay now
obviously

01:47:06.790 --> 01:47:06.800 align:start position:0%
obviously
 
01:47:09.430 --> 01:47:09.440 align:start position:0%
i speak only for myself
 
01:47:11.750 --> 01:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
your your opinion matters is is this the
 
01:47:13.750 --> 01:47:13.760 align:start position:0%
section that she drafted alternative
 
01:47:16.790 --> 01:47:16.800 align:start position:0%
language i i did mine isn't exactly the
 
01:47:17.990 --> 01:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
same but
 
01:47:20.229 --> 01:47:20.239 align:start position:0%
but this is the exact section right it
 
01:47:21.990 --> 01:47:22.000 align:start position:0%
is the exact section yes
 
01:47:23.990 --> 01:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
would you would you read verbatim the
 
01:47:27.750 --> 01:47:27.760 align:start position:0%
language he proposed please sure yes um
 
01:47:31.430 --> 01:47:31.440 align:start position:0%
what i had uh what i had said was uh in
 
01:47:31.440 --> 01:47:33.189 align:start position:0%
what i had uh what i had said was uh in
subsection

01:47:33.189 --> 01:47:33.199 align:start position:0%
subsection
 
01:47:34.950 --> 01:47:34.960 align:start position:0%
uh i
 
01:47:37.830 --> 01:47:37.840 align:start position:0%
sexual abuse means conduct which would
 
01:47:42.310 --> 01:47:42.320 align:start position:0%
constitute an offense under rsa 632 a21n
 
01:47:45.189 --> 01:47:45.199 align:start position:0%
rsa 632 a34
 
01:47:48.390 --> 01:47:48.400 align:start position:0%
or rsa 632 a43
 
01:47:51.510 --> 01:47:51.520 align:start position:0%
or a basis for civil liability for
 
01:47:53.109 --> 01:47:53.119 align:start position:0%
sexual assault
 
01:47:56.070 --> 01:47:56.080 align:start position:0%
under the statutory or common law of new
 
01:47:56.080 --> 01:47:57.910 align:start position:0%
under the statutory or common law of new
hampshire

01:47:57.910 --> 01:47:57.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:47:57.920 --> 01:47:58.950 align:start position:0%
hampshire
i

01:47:58.950 --> 01:47:58.960 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:48:00.070 --> 01:48:00.080 align:start position:0%
i think that's probably i think it's
 
01:48:04.390 --> 01:48:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:07.510 --> 01:48:07.520 align:start position:0%
from the victim's perspective does that
 
01:48:10.070 --> 01:48:10.080 align:start position:0%
make sense to you are you could
 
01:48:13.669 --> 01:48:13.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:15.910 --> 01:48:15.920 align:start position:0%
so i i guess we didn't have a chance to
 
01:48:18.229 --> 01:48:18.239 align:start position:0%
prepare but it to answer your question
 
01:48:20.629 --> 01:48:20.639 align:start position:0%
it does make sense to me it kind of goes
 
01:48:21.669 --> 01:48:21.679 align:start position:0%
back to
 
01:48:23.430 --> 01:48:23.440 align:start position:0%
the theme i was saying at the top at the
 
01:48:24.790 --> 01:48:24.800 align:start position:0%
end of the day the state wants to get a
 
01:48:27.030 --> 01:48:27.040 align:start position:0%
release of civil liability we're not
 
01:48:29.750 --> 01:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
talking about prosecuting these people
 
01:48:32.229 --> 01:48:32.239 align:start position:0%
through this statute we're talking about
 
01:48:35.189 --> 01:48:35.199 align:start position:0%
uh civil liability so i think going back
 
01:48:38.229 --> 01:48:38.239 align:start position:0%
to the common law now with
 
01:48:41.430 --> 01:48:41.440 align:start position:0%
with sexual um with the sexual assault
 
01:48:43.270 --> 01:48:43.280 align:start position:0%
statute it is helpful the criminal
 
01:48:45.189 --> 01:48:45.199 align:start position:0%
statute in defining what is sexual
 
01:48:45.199 --> 01:48:46.709 align:start position:0%
statute in defining what is sexual
contact

01:48:46.709 --> 01:48:46.719 align:start position:0%
contact
 
01:48:49.669 --> 01:48:49.679 align:start position:0%
and what is sexual penetration and i
 
01:48:51.430 --> 01:48:51.440 align:start position:0%
don't know that there's that much
 
01:48:53.109 --> 01:48:53.119 align:start position:0%
clarity in the common law maybe maybe
 
01:48:54.470 --> 01:48:54.480 align:start position:0%
there is
 
01:48:56.790 --> 01:48:56.800 align:start position:0%
but that's why i i still included a
 
01:48:58.830 --> 01:48:58.840 align:start position:0%
cross-reference to those
 
01:49:01.830 --> 01:49:01.840 align:start position:0%
provisions um
 
01:49:03.430 --> 01:49:03.440 align:start position:0%
but yeah i mean
 
01:49:05.750 --> 01:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
the general notion of this should be as
 
01:49:07.830 --> 01:49:07.840 align:start position:0%
encompassing as the common law makes
 
01:49:08.950 --> 01:49:08.960 align:start position:0%
sense to me
 
01:49:10.229 --> 01:49:10.239 align:start position:0%
and i would just say
 
01:49:12.870 --> 01:49:12.880 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i i don't with if we took
 
01:49:14.709 --> 01:49:14.719 align:start position:0%
out the reference to the state free
 
01:49:15.990 --> 01:49:16.000 align:start position:0%
force case
 
01:49:18.070 --> 01:49:18.080 align:start position:0%
i i personally don't have any problem
 
01:49:19.189 --> 01:49:19.199 align:start position:0%
with the way
 
01:49:22.229 --> 01:49:22.239 align:start position:0%
council has drafted uh the sexual abuse
 
01:49:22.239 --> 01:49:25.750 align:start position:0%
council has drafted uh the sexual abuse
definition

01:49:25.750 --> 01:49:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:25.760 --> 01:49:26.629 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:49:26.629 --> 01:49:26.639 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:49:29.830 --> 01:49:29.840 align:start position:0%
so um in order to feel like we're making
 
01:49:32.310 --> 01:49:32.320 align:start position:0%
some progress i i would like to do a
 
01:49:34.390 --> 01:49:34.400 align:start position:0%
straw vote um
 
01:49:36.950 --> 01:49:36.960 align:start position:0%
and i guess the straw vote is is really
 
01:49:39.589 --> 01:49:39.599 align:start position:0%
on item two not item one since we're
 
01:49:41.430 --> 01:49:41.440 align:start position:0%
talking about sexual abuse and not the
 
01:49:43.189 --> 01:49:43.199 align:start position:0%
physical piece line
 
01:49:43.199 --> 01:49:44.070 align:start position:0%
physical piece line
so

01:49:44.070 --> 01:49:44.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:49:47.189 --> 01:49:47.199 align:start position:0%
so what i would like a vote on is raise
 
01:49:50.390 --> 01:49:50.400 align:start position:0%
your hand if you think that the
 
01:49:53.030 --> 01:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
alternative language that representative
 
01:49:56.709 --> 01:49:56.719 align:start position:0%
lynn has has has drafted we should uh
 
01:49:58.790 --> 01:49:58.800 align:start position:0%
use that as alternative language to
 
01:50:00.629 --> 01:50:00.639 align:start position:0%
what's in this now
 
01:50:03.430 --> 01:50:03.440 align:start position:0%
and then the opposing vote will be
 
01:50:03.440 --> 01:50:04.470 align:start position:0%
and then the opposing vote will be
um

01:50:04.470 --> 01:50:04.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:06.709 --> 01:50:06.719 align:start position:0%
we'll have to keep talking about it
 
01:50:08.830 --> 01:50:08.840 align:start position:0%
go go ahead representative
 
01:50:11.430 --> 01:50:11.440 align:start position:0%
walls um given that everybody agrees on
 
01:50:13.669 --> 01:50:13.679 align:start position:0%
the plaintiffs language i'm wondering if
 
01:50:15.270 --> 01:50:15.280 align:start position:0%
that's the language we should be voting
 
01:50:15.280 --> 01:50:16.310 align:start position:0%
that's the language we should be voting
on

01:50:16.310 --> 01:50:16.320 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:50:17.830 --> 01:50:17.840 align:start position:0%
since there seems to be some slight
 
01:50:19.830 --> 01:50:19.840 align:start position:0%
discrepancy with representative linz but
 
01:50:21.270 --> 01:50:21.280 align:start position:0%
everybody seems to be in agreement on
 
01:50:22.870 --> 01:50:22.880 align:start position:0%
the plaintiff's language
 
01:50:24.790 --> 01:50:24.800 align:start position:0%
i i don't know that i share the
 
01:50:26.550 --> 01:50:26.560 align:start position:0%
assumption that everyone agrees with the
 
01:50:29.189 --> 01:50:29.199 align:start position:0%
plaintiff's language i i do
 
01:50:31.750 --> 01:50:31.760 align:start position:0%
tend to want to defer to a member of the
 
01:50:34.870 --> 01:50:34.880 align:start position:0%
legislature one draft in legislation
 
01:50:37.510 --> 01:50:37.520 align:start position:0%
and and he spends some considerable time
 
01:50:40.310 --> 01:50:40.320 align:start position:0%
looking at this issue
 
01:50:41.830 --> 01:50:41.840 align:start position:0%
i i don't want to overstate what i meant
 
01:50:43.750 --> 01:50:43.760 align:start position:0%
by everybody i meant by representative
 
01:50:45.270 --> 01:50:45.280 align:start position:0%
lin and the plaintiff's attorney i meant
 
01:50:47.270 --> 01:50:47.280 align:start position:0%
both of them agree that was what i meant
 
01:50:49.350 --> 01:50:49.360 align:start position:0%
by everybody not the whole committee uh
 
01:50:51.270 --> 01:50:51.280 align:start position:0%
so but i heard both of them agree on the
 
01:50:53.350 --> 01:50:53.360 align:start position:0%
plaintiff's language so that's why i was
 
01:50:55.030 --> 01:50:55.040 align:start position:0%
suggesting that might be what we should
 
01:50:56.390 --> 01:50:56.400 align:start position:0%
be voting on
 
01:50:58.229 --> 01:50:58.239 align:start position:0%
so so rather than speaking for you
 
01:51:00.870 --> 01:51:00.880 align:start position:0%
representative lynn i i i interpreted
 
01:51:02.790 --> 01:51:02.800 align:start position:0%
you to have distinct alternative
 
01:51:04.470 --> 01:51:04.480 align:start position:0%
language to what the plaintiff has
 
01:51:04.480 --> 01:51:06.790 align:start position:0%
language to what the plaintiff has
offered

01:51:06.790 --> 01:51:06.800 align:start position:0%
offered
 
01:51:07.990 --> 01:51:08.000 align:start position:0%
yet well
 
01:51:10.310 --> 01:51:10.320 align:start position:0%
that's true i mean my language is is a
 
01:51:12.790 --> 01:51:12.800 align:start position:0%
little bit shorter than what council had
 
01:51:15.350 --> 01:51:15.360 align:start position:0%
had proposed but i as i said before i
 
01:51:16.470 --> 01:51:16.480 align:start position:0%
think if
 
01:51:19.189 --> 01:51:19.199 align:start position:0%
the only substantive difference as i see
 
01:51:21.030 --> 01:51:21.040 align:start position:0%
it is
 
01:51:22.550 --> 01:51:22.560 align:start position:0%
is that if
 
01:51:24.149 --> 01:51:24.159 align:start position:0%
if you take out the language the
 
01:51:25.910 --> 01:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
reference to state versus foss which as
 
01:51:28.870 --> 01:51:28.880 align:start position:0%
i understand it council agrees that that
 
01:51:30.870 --> 01:51:30.880 align:start position:0%
he would he would agree with then i
 
01:51:32.390 --> 01:51:32.400 align:start position:0%
don't really think that there's any
 
01:51:35.189 --> 01:51:35.199 align:start position:0%
substantive difference between my
 
01:51:37.669 --> 01:51:37.679 align:start position:0%
language and his language his is
 
01:51:40.070 --> 01:51:40.080 align:start position:0%
a a little more detailed but i think
 
01:51:43.109 --> 01:51:43.119 align:start position:0%
substantively the two are the same
 
01:51:44.790 --> 01:51:44.800 align:start position:0%
so i need to take this down to like the
 
01:51:47.430 --> 01:51:47.440 align:start position:0%
101 level instead of the 501 level i
 
01:51:48.709 --> 01:51:48.719 align:start position:0%
just need
 
01:51:51.910 --> 01:51:51.920 align:start position:0%
which paragraph will go in is it your
 
01:51:53.750 --> 01:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
position and it's got to be kind of a
 
01:51:56.070 --> 01:51:56.080 align:start position:0%
binary thing that we should accept the
 
01:51:58.310 --> 01:51:58.320 align:start position:0%
plaintiff's language or that we should
 
01:52:00.709 --> 01:52:00.719 align:start position:0%
alt substitute your language is which
 
01:52:03.109 --> 01:52:03.119 align:start position:0%
one i i would i would use the
 
01:52:04.950 --> 01:52:04.960 align:start position:0%
plaintiff's language with the striking
 
01:52:08.149 --> 01:52:08.159 align:start position:0%
out the state versus false reference
 
01:52:10.870 --> 01:52:10.880 align:start position:0%
thank you representative griffin
 
01:52:12.709 --> 01:52:12.719 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:52:15.109 --> 01:52:15.119 align:start position:0%
i believe that the legislature should do
 
01:52:17.830 --> 01:52:17.840 align:start position:0%
the drafting and therefore
 
01:52:19.830 --> 01:52:19.840 align:start position:0%
i would like us to use lepers
 
01:52:22.550 --> 01:52:22.560 align:start position:0%
representative lim's language and that's
 
01:52:25.030 --> 01:52:25.040 align:start position:0%
the question you originally raised
 
01:52:27.910 --> 01:52:27.920 align:start position:0%
and i'd like us to vote on it yes
 
01:52:29.589 --> 01:52:29.599 align:start position:0%
all right you still you still think that
 
01:52:31.109 --> 01:52:31.119 align:start position:0%
even though representative lin has
 
01:52:32.950 --> 01:52:32.960 align:start position:0%
changed his position a little bit made
 
01:52:34.390 --> 01:52:34.400 align:start position:0%
it okay
 
01:52:36.709 --> 01:52:36.719 align:start position:0%
we can have we can do that
 
01:52:38.070 --> 01:52:38.080 align:start position:0%
representative earth did you have a
 
01:52:41.910 --> 01:52:41.920 align:start position:0%
question i agree with that perspective
 
01:52:41.920 --> 01:52:43.350 align:start position:0%
question i agree with that perspective
okay

01:52:43.350 --> 01:52:43.360 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:52:45.750 --> 01:52:45.760 align:start position:0%
so um
 
01:52:47.189 --> 01:52:47.199 align:start position:0%
we're going to go ahead and do the straw
 
01:52:49.270 --> 01:52:49.280 align:start position:0%
vote we're going to vote
 
01:52:51.910 --> 01:52:51.920 align:start position:0%
on bullet two
 
01:52:54.229 --> 01:52:54.239 align:start position:0%
the show of hands at this point
 
01:52:56.229 --> 01:52:56.239 align:start position:0%
indicates that you support the use of
 
01:52:59.030 --> 01:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
representative lens language
 
01:53:00.950 --> 01:53:00.960 align:start position:0%
uh and then the second vote is going to
 
01:53:01.600 --> 01:53:01.610 align:start position:0%
be if you
 
01:53:01.610 --> 01:53:02.950 align:start position:0%
be if you
[Music]

01:53:02.950 --> 01:53:02.960 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:53:05.910 --> 01:53:05.920 align:start position:0%
prefer the plaintiff's language okay
 
01:53:05.920 --> 01:53:06.790 align:start position:0%
prefer the plaintiff's language okay
so

01:53:06.790 --> 01:53:06.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:53:06.800 --> 01:53:07.589 align:start position:0%
so
uh

01:53:07.589 --> 01:53:07.599 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:53:10.149 --> 01:53:10.159 align:start position:0%
is it clear what what we're doing
 
01:53:10.159 --> 01:53:11.030 align:start position:0%
is it clear what what we're doing
okay

01:53:11.030 --> 01:53:11.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:53:12.790 --> 01:53:12.800 align:start position:0%
raise your hand if you think we should
 
01:53:15.830 --> 01:53:15.840 align:start position:0%
accept representative lin's alternative
 
01:53:29.589 --> 01:53:29.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:32.470 --> 01:53:32.480 align:start position:0%
so so the clerk counts five um now we're
 
01:53:33.990 --> 01:53:34.000 align:start position:0%
going to go
 
01:53:36.390 --> 01:53:36.400 align:start position:0%
the opposite and say accepting
 
01:53:43.589 --> 01:53:43.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:46.229 --> 01:53:46.239 align:start position:0%
so that's clerk count six so that's six
 
01:53:47.589 --> 01:53:47.599 align:start position:0%
to five to go with the plaintiff's
 
01:53:53.350 --> 01:53:53.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:56.870 --> 01:53:56.880 align:start position:0%
mr mr chairman uh mr representative are
 
01:53:59.430 --> 01:53:59.440 align:start position:0%
we still striking the language that
 
01:54:01.030 --> 01:54:01.040 align:start position:0%
representative lin referred to and if so
 
01:54:02.310 --> 01:54:02.320 align:start position:0%
i don't know exactly what language that
 
01:54:03.830 --> 01:54:03.840 align:start position:0%
is that's being stricken
 
01:54:05.830 --> 01:54:05.840 align:start position:0%
i think what we just said was that we
 
01:54:08.790 --> 01:54:08.800 align:start position:0%
would accept the language for
 
01:54:11.189 --> 01:54:11.199 align:start position:0%
lines 39
 
01:54:13.430 --> 01:54:13.440 align:start position:0%
on page 1
 
01:54:13.440 --> 01:54:16.390 align:start position:0%
on page 1
through

01:54:16.390 --> 01:54:16.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:18.390 --> 01:54:18.400 align:start position:0%
page 2
 
01:54:20.229 --> 01:54:20.239 align:start position:0%
line 1
 
01:54:23.189 --> 01:54:23.199 align:start position:0%
in accordance with what the plaintiffs
 
01:54:25.109 --> 01:54:25.119 align:start position:0%
have written
 
01:54:27.189 --> 01:54:27.199 align:start position:0%
that's what i think we just voted on is
 
01:54:27.199 --> 01:54:27.990 align:start position:0%
that's what i think we just voted on is
that

01:54:27.990 --> 01:54:28.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:54:29.750 --> 01:54:29.760 align:start position:0%
correct me if i'm wrong representative
 
01:54:33.030 --> 01:54:33.040 align:start position:0%
lynn i i think the i the language that i
 
01:54:33.040 --> 01:54:34.709 align:start position:0%
lynn i i think the i the language that i
think

01:54:34.709 --> 01:54:34.719 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:54:37.189 --> 01:54:37.199 align:start position:0%
that i understood you voted on and then
 
01:54:38.390 --> 01:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
got the six
 
01:54:40.629 --> 01:54:40.639 align:start position:0%
votes was that you would take out the
 
01:54:43.910 --> 01:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
language that begins on line 40
 
01:54:46.790 --> 01:54:46.800 align:start position:0%
and and that says accept that coercion
 
01:54:50.149 --> 01:54:50.159 align:start position:0%
as interpreted in state v foss 148 new
 
01:54:52.390 --> 01:54:52.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire 209 202
 
01:54:54.229 --> 01:54:54.239 align:start position:0%
to require an affirmative act by the
 
01:54:54.239 --> 01:54:55.510 align:start position:0%
to require an affirmative act by the
perpetrator

01:54:55.510 --> 01:54:55.520 align:start position:0%
perpetrator
 
01:54:58.390 --> 01:54:58.400 align:start position:0%
shall not be required you take out that
 
01:55:01.350 --> 01:55:01.360 align:start position:0%
language but other than that it would be
 
01:55:04.310 --> 01:55:04.320 align:start position:0%
the sexual abuse language used by a
 
01:55:05.750 --> 01:55:05.760 align:start position:0%
claimant's counsel
 
01:55:08.709 --> 01:55:08.719 align:start position:0%
so delete starting on line 41 of the
 
01:55:08.719 --> 01:55:09.990 align:start position:0%
so delete starting on line 41 of the
plaintiff's

01:55:09.990 --> 01:55:10.000 align:start position:0%
plaintiff's
 
01:55:12.470 --> 01:55:12.480 align:start position:0%
document where it says accept accept
 
01:55:14.629 --> 01:55:14.639 align:start position:0%
that's right and then continue the
 
01:55:14.639 --> 01:55:16.070 align:start position:0%
that's right and then continue the
deletion

01:55:16.070 --> 01:55:16.080 align:start position:0%
deletion
 
01:55:20.950 --> 01:55:20.960 align:start position:0%
until we get to the next page um
 
01:55:23.510 --> 01:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
to what word the word required
 
01:55:25.430 --> 01:55:25.440 align:start position:0%
to delete the word required delete the
 
01:55:27.589 --> 01:55:27.599 align:start position:0%
word required exactly you have a problem
 
01:55:28.550 --> 01:55:28.560 align:start position:0%
with that
 
01:55:28.560 --> 01:55:29.990 align:start position:0%
with that
mr

01:55:29.990 --> 01:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
mr
 
01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:30.950 align:start position:0%
mr
dean

01:55:30.950 --> 01:55:30.960 align:start position:0%
dean
 
01:55:33.030 --> 01:55:33.040 align:start position:0%
i know that that that works for us thank
 
01:55:35.669 --> 01:55:35.679 align:start position:0%
you okay so let's let's let's do it that
 
01:55:38.950 --> 01:55:38.960 align:start position:0%
way without re-voting
 
01:55:41.109 --> 01:55:41.119 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:55:41.119 --> 01:55:41.990 align:start position:0%
thank you
okay

01:55:41.990 --> 01:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:55:44.149 --> 01:55:44.159 align:start position:0%
so let's go back to
 
01:55:44.159 --> 01:55:46.149 align:start position:0%
so let's go back to
um

01:55:46.149 --> 01:55:46.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:48.310 --> 01:55:48.320 align:start position:0%
uh mr attorney general did you have an
 
01:55:50.870 --> 01:55:50.880 align:start position:0%
issue with that
 
01:55:52.870 --> 01:55:52.880 align:start position:0%
okay i just i don't want to assume i
 
01:55:54.070 --> 01:55:54.080 align:start position:0%
don't want to
 
01:55:54.080 --> 01:55:55.589 align:start position:0%
don't want to
okay

01:55:55.589 --> 01:55:55.599 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:55:58.149 --> 01:55:58.159 align:start position:0%
okay thank you um
 
01:56:01.910 --> 01:56:01.920 align:start position:0%
so i think we skipped over uh item one
 
01:56:05.510 --> 01:56:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:07.430 --> 01:56:07.440 align:start position:0%
uh yes yes uh
 
01:56:11.510 --> 01:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
so item one uh physical abuse uh
 
01:56:14.070 --> 01:56:14.080 align:start position:0%
our our edits there are essentially the
 
01:56:14.080 --> 01:56:15.270 align:start position:0%
our our edits there are essentially the
same

01:56:15.270 --> 01:56:15.280 align:start position:0%
same
 
01:56:17.830 --> 01:56:17.840 align:start position:0%
it's the same concept that we want to
 
01:56:20.310 --> 01:56:20.320 align:start position:0%
incorporate the common law causes of
 
01:56:20.320 --> 01:56:21.430 align:start position:0%
incorporate the common law causes of
action

01:56:21.430 --> 01:56:21.440 align:start position:0%
action
 
01:56:21.440 --> 01:56:22.709 align:start position:0%
action
um

01:56:22.709 --> 01:56:22.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:24.629 --> 01:56:24.639 align:start position:0%
you know in the definition of physical
 
01:56:26.870 --> 01:56:26.880 align:start position:0%
abuse since again it is the common law
 
01:56:29.589 --> 01:56:29.599 align:start position:0%
claims that the claimant will be
 
01:56:29.599 --> 01:56:31.990 align:start position:0%
claims that the claimant will be
releasing

01:56:31.990 --> 01:56:32.000 align:start position:0%
releasing
 
01:56:38.470 --> 01:56:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:39.669 --> 01:56:39.679 align:start position:0%
i say
 
01:56:42.550 --> 01:56:42.560 align:start position:0%
i i i don't have a problem with the with
 
01:56:44.790 --> 01:56:44.800 align:start position:0%
what plaintiff has proposed
 
01:56:46.149 --> 01:56:46.159 align:start position:0%
there either because i think if
 
01:56:48.390 --> 01:56:48.400 align:start position:0%
something is a common law
 
01:56:50.470 --> 01:56:50.480 align:start position:0%
there's a common law basis for liability
 
01:56:52.470 --> 01:56:52.480 align:start position:0%
then that then the state should assume
 
01:56:54.870 --> 01:56:54.880 align:start position:0%
that responsibility all right and mr
 
01:56:57.750 --> 01:56:57.760 align:start position:0%
attorney general
 
01:56:57.760 --> 01:56:58.470 align:start position:0%
attorney general
so

01:56:58.470 --> 01:56:58.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:57:00.709 --> 01:57:00.719 align:start position:0%
i don't have an issue with i think
 
01:57:02.790 --> 01:57:02.800 align:start position:0%
the language regarding including common
 
01:57:05.589 --> 01:57:05.599 align:start position:0%
law causes of action but
 
01:57:08.149 --> 01:57:08.159 align:start position:0%
changing the specific offenses to all of
 
01:57:10.950 --> 01:57:10.960 align:start position:0%
rsa 631
 
01:57:13.109 --> 01:57:13.119 align:start position:0%
i would recommend at least that full
 
01:57:15.750 --> 01:57:15.760 align:start position:0%
change because rsa 631 includes things
 
01:57:17.910 --> 01:57:17.920 align:start position:0%
such as reckless conduct
 
01:57:19.669 --> 01:57:19.679 align:start position:0%
criminal threatening
 
01:57:20.950 --> 01:57:20.960 align:start position:0%
you know something like criminal
 
01:57:22.390 --> 01:57:22.400 align:start position:0%
threatening is not something that i
 
01:57:22.400 --> 01:57:26.870 align:start position:0%
threatening is not something that i
think

01:57:26.870 --> 01:57:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:28.950 --> 01:57:28.960 align:start position:0%
so it sounds like the carve outs that
 
01:57:32.070 --> 01:57:32.080 align:start position:0%
that are in here for six thirty one one
 
01:57:35.189 --> 01:57:35.199 align:start position:0%
six thirty one two six thirty one
 
01:57:37.189 --> 01:57:37.199 align:start position:0%
i guess two is repeated i'm not sure
 
01:57:38.550 --> 01:57:38.560 align:start position:0%
what that is
 
01:57:39.669 --> 01:57:39.679 align:start position:0%
to a
 
01:57:41.510 --> 01:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
you you would recommend that we keep
 
01:57:44.390 --> 01:57:44.400 align:start position:0%
that and not go to a blanket
 
01:57:46.229 --> 01:57:46.239 align:start position:0%
yes because that's first degree assault
 
01:57:48.310 --> 01:57:48.320 align:start position:0%
second degree assault symbol
 
01:57:50.550 --> 01:57:50.560 align:start position:0%
you know the rest of that
 
01:57:53.030 --> 01:57:53.040 align:start position:0%
the rest of that chapter or section is
 
01:57:55.189 --> 01:57:55.199 align:start position:0%
domestic violence reckless conduct
 
01:57:56.629 --> 01:57:56.639 align:start position:0%
criminal threatening
 
01:57:58.870 --> 01:57:58.880 align:start position:0%
conduct involving laser pointing devices
 
01:58:00.470 --> 01:58:00.480 align:start position:0%
no failure to report injuries there's
 
01:58:03.189 --> 01:58:03.199 align:start position:0%
student losing so i think
 
01:58:04.629 --> 01:58:04.639 align:start position:0%
i think we should stick with those
 
01:58:07.109 --> 01:58:07.119 align:start position:0%
specific parts
 
01:58:09.189 --> 01:58:09.199 align:start position:0%
thank you so um
 
01:58:12.070 --> 01:58:12.080 align:start position:0%
mr dean mr hayden do you
 
01:58:14.790 --> 01:58:14.800 align:start position:0%
have any violent opposition to what the
 
01:58:16.950 --> 01:58:16.960 align:start position:0%
attorney general just said
 
01:58:18.470 --> 01:58:18.480 align:start position:0%
no i don't think we have violent
 
01:58:20.629 --> 01:58:20.639 align:start position:0%
opposition it you know assuming the the
 
01:58:21.910 --> 01:58:21.920 align:start position:0%
common law
 
01:58:23.589 --> 01:58:23.599 align:start position:0%
uh causes of action for assault and
 
01:58:26.070 --> 01:58:26.080 align:start position:0%
battery are included i i think we can we
 
01:58:28.310 --> 01:58:28.320 align:start position:0%
can live with that that change i i think
 
01:58:31.109 --> 01:58:31.119 align:start position:0%
we're open to the common law
 
01:58:33.510 --> 01:58:33.520 align:start position:0%
okay so i don't know how to straw vote
 
01:58:35.430 --> 01:58:35.440 align:start position:0%
this one because it requires me to
 
01:58:37.189 --> 01:58:37.199 align:start position:0%
remember so i think i think what we're
 
01:58:39.589 --> 01:58:39.599 align:start position:0%
going to do is we're going to change 36
 
01:58:41.109 --> 01:58:41.119 align:start position:0%
to read
 
01:58:43.910 --> 01:58:43.920 align:start position:0%
physical abuse means a single incident
 
01:58:46.709 --> 01:58:46.719 align:start position:0%
of conduct that would constitute an
 
01:58:49.310 --> 01:58:49.320 align:start position:0%
offense under rsa
 
01:58:53.990 --> 01:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
631-1 631-2 or 631-2
 
01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:55.270 align:start position:0%
631-1 631-2 or 631-2
alpha

01:58:55.270 --> 01:58:55.280 align:start position:0%
alpha
 
01:58:59.830 --> 01:58:59.840 align:start position:0%
and that is not justified under rsa 627
 
01:58:59.840 --> 01:59:01.510 align:start position:0%
and that is not justified under rsa 627
colon

01:59:01.510 --> 01:59:01.520 align:start position:0%
colon
 
01:59:04.229 --> 01:59:04.239 align:start position:0%
or a common law cause of action for
 
01:59:06.229 --> 01:59:06.239 align:start position:0%
assault or battery
 
01:59:08.550 --> 01:59:08.560 align:start position:0%
okay so we're going to do a straw vote
 
01:59:10.390 --> 01:59:10.400 align:start position:0%
if you accept the language as i just
 
01:59:12.470 --> 01:59:12.480 align:start position:0%
read it you'll raise your hand if you
 
01:59:13.990 --> 01:59:14.000 align:start position:0%
want to do something else we'll talk
 
01:59:16.149 --> 01:59:16.159 align:start position:0%
about it some more
 
01:59:19.109 --> 01:59:19.119 align:start position:0%
so show hands do you agree with the way
 
01:59:20.149 --> 01:59:20.159 align:start position:0%
we just
 
01:59:30.629 --> 01:59:30.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:32.709 --> 01:59:32.719 align:start position:0%
the vote is 12.
 
01:59:34.790 --> 01:59:34.800 align:start position:0%
if you're opposed to accepting that
 
01:59:38.070 --> 01:59:38.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:40.550 --> 01:59:40.560 align:start position:0%
nobody left okay that makes sense right
 
01:59:44.390 --> 01:59:44.400 align:start position:0%
8 plus 5 is 12. yeah got it
 
01:59:46.870 --> 01:59:46.880 align:start position:0%
no no fifth grade i'm still using that
 
01:59:46.880 --> 01:59:48.229 align:start position:0%
no no fifth grade i'm still using that
knowledge

01:59:48.229 --> 01:59:48.239 align:start position:0%
knowledge
 
01:59:48.239 --> 01:59:50.550 align:start position:0%
knowledge
uh

01:59:50.550 --> 01:59:50.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:53.830 --> 01:59:53.840 align:start position:0%
so we we've we've gone through one and
 
01:59:53.840 --> 01:59:55.030 align:start position:0%
so we we've we've gone through one and
two

01:59:55.030 --> 01:59:55.040 align:start position:0%
two
 
01:59:58.470 --> 01:59:58.480 align:start position:0%
do you want to pick up uh three now
 
02:00:01.030 --> 02:00:01.040 align:start position:0%
i do and thank you that's one for me mr
 
02:00:02.790 --> 02:00:02.800 align:start position:0%
chairman um
 
02:00:04.310 --> 02:00:04.320 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
02:00:04.320 --> 02:00:06.229 align:start position:0%
so uh
um

02:00:06.229 --> 02:00:06.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:07.990 --> 02:00:08.000 align:start position:0%
uh the comments in
 
02:00:10.070 --> 02:00:10.080 align:start position:0%
section three are on page two starting
 
02:00:12.390 --> 02:00:12.400 align:start position:0%
at line twenty 20
 
02:00:14.550 --> 02:00:14.560 align:start position:0%
and really
 
02:00:16.550 --> 02:00:16.560 align:start position:0%
the idea of these changes was you know
 
02:00:18.470 --> 02:00:18.480 align:start position:0%
we wrestled with some of the issues that
 
02:00:20.229 --> 02:00:20.239 align:start position:0%
represented weil and representative
 
02:00:20.239 --> 02:00:22.550 align:start position:0%
represented weil and representative
emrick

02:00:22.550 --> 02:00:22.560 align:start position:0%
emrick
 
02:00:24.790 --> 02:00:24.800 align:start position:0%
discussed in the context of that you
 
02:00:26.470 --> 02:00:26.480 align:start position:0%
know the folks who are going to be
 
02:00:26.480 --> 02:00:28.310 align:start position:0%
know the folks who are going to be
qualified

02:00:28.310 --> 02:00:28.320 align:start position:0%
qualified
 
02:00:32.950 --> 02:00:32.960 align:start position:0%
to be administrators um and agreeable to
 
02:00:35.589 --> 02:00:35.599 align:start position:0%
both the attorney general and our firm
 
02:00:37.669 --> 02:00:37.679 align:start position:0%
are unlikely to be people who are
 
02:00:40.550 --> 02:00:40.560 align:start position:0%
willing to abandon their career
 
02:00:42.950 --> 02:00:42.960 align:start position:0%
and become a full-time employee of the
 
02:00:45.589 --> 02:00:45.599 align:start position:0%
state to run this process
 
02:00:47.189 --> 02:00:47.199 align:start position:0%
and that will certainly be true in the
 
02:00:50.390 --> 02:00:50.400 align:start position:0%
early stages as they ramp up
 
02:00:52.790 --> 02:00:52.800 align:start position:0%
so we thought that
 
02:00:55.030 --> 02:00:55.040 align:start position:0%
we should add to this bill the
 
02:00:56.790 --> 02:00:56.800 align:start position:0%
opportunity to
 
02:00:58.709 --> 02:00:58.719 align:start position:0%
allow for a part-time
 
02:00:58.719 --> 02:01:00.550 align:start position:0%
allow for a part-time
administrative

02:01:00.550 --> 02:01:00.560 align:start position:0%
administrative
 
02:01:02.550 --> 02:01:02.560 align:start position:0%
and then frankly
 
02:01:05.109 --> 02:01:05.119 align:start position:0%
i just made the part-time administrator
 
02:01:07.510 --> 02:01:07.520 align:start position:0%
as qualified as the administrator that
 
02:01:08.950 --> 02:01:08.960 align:start position:0%
we've defined
 
02:01:08.960 --> 02:01:09.990 align:start position:0%
we've defined
and

02:01:09.990 --> 02:01:10.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:01:12.550 --> 02:01:12.560 align:start position:0%
later on basically saying that
 
02:01:14.550 --> 02:01:14.560 align:start position:0%
that part-time
 
02:01:16.229 --> 02:01:16.239 align:start position:0%
administrator would be paid at the same
 
02:01:18.629 --> 02:01:18.639 align:start position:0%
compensation rate as a full-time judge
 
02:01:21.030 --> 02:01:21.040 align:start position:0%
so really to build some flexibility into
 
02:01:23.510 --> 02:01:23.520 align:start position:0%
this as we move forward and you know
 
02:01:25.430 --> 02:01:25.440 align:start position:0%
frankly is a way of streamlining the
 
02:01:27.750 --> 02:01:27.760 align:start position:0%
process i would hope uh to get the right
 
02:01:29.750 --> 02:01:29.760 align:start position:0%
people in the right spot to so that we
 
02:01:31.669 --> 02:01:31.679 align:start position:0%
can advance discussions
 
02:01:34.310 --> 02:01:34.320 align:start position:0%
um after this bill is passed
 
02:01:36.550 --> 02:01:36.560 align:start position:0%
okay so let's let's uh let's pause there
 
02:01:39.350 --> 02:01:39.360 align:start position:0%
because we've got a clear break um the
 
02:01:41.510 --> 02:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
first half of three
 
02:01:43.589 --> 02:01:43.599 align:start position:0%
asks for the ability to permit a
 
02:01:45.510 --> 02:01:45.520 align:start position:0%
part-time administrator
 
02:01:48.790 --> 02:01:48.800 align:start position:0%
uh and earlier we talked about imposing
 
02:01:52.870 --> 02:01:52.880 align:start position:0%
a ceiling for the salary not not a
 
02:01:55.510 --> 02:01:55.520 align:start position:0%
description of the salary so if the
 
02:01:58.229 --> 02:01:58.239 align:start position:0%
committee were to accept part-time with
 
02:02:01.589 --> 02:02:01.599 align:start position:0%
the ceiling of being paid at the judge
 
02:02:04.870 --> 02:02:04.880 align:start position:0%
level is that acceptable to y'all
 
02:02:06.870 --> 02:02:06.880 align:start position:0%
um it is acceptable
 
02:02:06.880 --> 02:02:07.750 align:start position:0%
um it is acceptable
okay

02:02:07.750 --> 02:02:07.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:02:09.350 --> 02:02:09.360 align:start position:0%
mr attorney general do you have an issue
 
02:02:11.589 --> 02:02:11.599 align:start position:0%
with that are you still back there
 
02:02:13.109 --> 02:02:13.119 align:start position:0%
oh there you are i moved here just so i
 
02:02:14.790 --> 02:02:14.800 align:start position:0%
had a microphone just to make it easier
 
02:02:17.430 --> 02:02:17.440 align:start position:0%
that that's fine with me i think that
 
02:02:19.350 --> 02:02:19.360 align:start position:0%
makes sense
 
02:02:21.830 --> 02:02:21.840 align:start position:0%
okay great let's let's put a pin in that
 
02:02:23.589 --> 02:02:23.599 align:start position:0%
and then move on to the
 
02:02:23.599 --> 02:02:25.510 align:start position:0%
and then move on to the
second

02:02:25.510 --> 02:02:25.520 align:start position:0%
second
 
02:02:29.430 --> 02:02:29.440 align:start position:0%
representation burger yes thank you um
 
02:02:31.750 --> 02:02:31.760 align:start position:0%
if we're going to go to a part-time then
 
02:02:33.510 --> 02:02:33.520 align:start position:0%
we need to describe how we're going to
 
02:02:36.149 --> 02:02:36.159 align:start position:0%
come up with the salary
 
02:02:38.870 --> 02:02:38.880 align:start position:0%
we can't just you know we can say that
 
02:02:41.990 --> 02:02:42.000 align:start position:0%
if you're full-time you get x
 
02:02:43.910 --> 02:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
but if you're part-time you get you have
 
02:02:45.189 --> 02:02:45.199 align:start position:0%
to get y
 
02:02:47.350 --> 02:02:47.360 align:start position:0%
so so my understanding of that is if we
 
02:02:49.350 --> 02:02:49.360 align:start position:0%
impose a ceiling anything below that
 
02:02:51.270 --> 02:02:51.280 align:start position:0%
ceiling for a part-time person could be
 
02:02:54.310 --> 02:02:54.320 align:start position:0%
negotiated uh is that not adequate by
 
02:02:54.320 --> 02:02:55.189 align:start position:0%
negotiated uh is that not adequate by
whom

02:02:55.189 --> 02:02:55.199 align:start position:0%
whom
 
02:02:57.189 --> 02:02:57.199 align:start position:0%
you ought to say oh by the attorney
 
02:02:58.870 --> 02:02:58.880 align:start position:0%
general aren't the attorney generals the
 
02:03:00.709 --> 02:03:00.719 align:start position:0%
gatekeeper to the hiring process isn't
 
02:03:05.270 --> 02:03:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:07.990 --> 02:03:08.000 align:start position:0%
okay okay we the the attorney general
 
02:03:10.070 --> 02:03:10.080 align:start position:0%
and the um
 
02:03:13.189 --> 02:03:13.199 align:start position:0%
council submit the names to
 
02:03:16.229 --> 02:03:16.239 align:start position:0%
this supreme court and the supreme court
 
02:03:17.990 --> 02:03:18.000 align:start position:0%
chooses whoever
 
02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:18.709 align:start position:0%
chooses whoever
so

02:03:18.709 --> 02:03:18.719 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:03:20.870 --> 02:03:20.880 align:start position:0%
we need to have something in there
 
02:03:22.310 --> 02:03:22.320 align:start position:0%
that says
 
02:03:24.310 --> 02:03:24.320 align:start position:0%
somebody needs to figure out how much
 
02:03:26.149 --> 02:03:26.159 align:start position:0%
we're going to pay the part-time person
 
02:03:27.669 --> 02:03:27.679 align:start position:0%
if in fact
 
02:03:27.679 --> 02:03:28.790 align:start position:0%
if in fact
that's

02:03:28.790 --> 02:03:28.800 align:start position:0%
that's
 
02:03:33.189 --> 02:03:33.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:34.709 --> 02:03:34.719 align:start position:0%
and oh by the way i don't have any
 
02:03:36.870 --> 02:03:36.880 align:start position:0%
suggestions okay so
 
02:03:40.310 --> 02:03:40.320 align:start position:0%
that'll save me that i i to me the the
 
02:03:41.990 --> 02:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
notion of being able to go to a
 
02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:43.109 align:start position:0%
notion of being able to go to a
part-time

02:03:43.109 --> 02:03:43.119 align:start position:0%
part-time
 
02:03:46.390 --> 02:03:46.400 align:start position:0%
administrator just makes sense in year
 
02:03:49.910 --> 02:03:49.920 align:start position:0%
three four five in particular um
 
02:03:52.550 --> 02:03:52.560 align:start position:0%
i i have no idea on how to
 
02:03:54.790 --> 02:03:54.800 align:start position:0%
set up the language to negotiate a
 
02:03:57.430 --> 02:03:57.440 align:start position:0%
part-time salary representative walsh do
 
02:03:59.109 --> 02:03:59.119 align:start position:0%
you have a great idea well i don't know
 
02:04:01.510 --> 02:04:01.520 align:start position:0%
if it's great but i have an idea
 
02:04:03.750 --> 02:04:03.760 align:start position:0%
and that is is that you take
 
02:04:06.470 --> 02:04:06.480 align:start position:0%
the hourly value of the salary and
 
02:04:09.350 --> 02:04:09.360 align:start position:0%
benefits of a full-time judge and you
 
02:04:11.350 --> 02:04:11.360 align:start position:0%
compute that out and that the part-time
 
02:04:13.109 --> 02:04:13.119 align:start position:0%
administrator is paid at that hourly
 
02:04:14.950 --> 02:04:14.960 align:start position:0%
rate but i think you'd want to include
 
02:04:16.790 --> 02:04:16.800 align:start position:0%
both salary and benefits the value
 
02:04:16.800 --> 02:04:19.350 align:start position:0%
both salary and benefits the value
thereof

02:04:19.350 --> 02:04:19.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:22.149 --> 02:04:22.159 align:start position:0%
do you have language that you'd propose
 
02:04:22.159 --> 02:04:23.189 align:start position:0%
do you have language that you'd propose
um

02:04:23.189 --> 02:04:23.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:25.510 --> 02:04:25.520 align:start position:0%
i probably could create some
 
02:04:27.669 --> 02:04:27.679 align:start position:0%
um i'm sure anybody else here could too
 
02:04:29.990 --> 02:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
that's not that hard to create
 
02:04:33.830 --> 02:04:33.840 align:start position:0%
you know just that the the the the
 
02:04:35.669 --> 02:04:35.679 align:start position:0%
payment to the administrator shall be at
 
02:04:38.470 --> 02:04:38.480 align:start position:0%
a rate the equivalent of
 
02:04:40.790 --> 02:04:40.800 align:start position:0%
the hourly
 
02:04:40.800 --> 02:04:42.390 align:start position:0%
the hourly
cost

02:04:42.390 --> 02:04:42.400 align:start position:0%
cost
 
02:04:44.470 --> 02:04:44.480 align:start position:0%
of salary and benefits of a full-time
 
02:04:44.480 --> 02:04:47.750 align:start position:0%
of salary and benefits of a full-time
judge

02:04:47.750 --> 02:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:49.910 --> 02:04:49.920 align:start position:0%
it sounded good to me
 
02:04:51.589 --> 02:04:51.599 align:start position:0%
representative formella did you or
 
02:04:53.750 --> 02:04:53.760 align:start position:0%
excuse me attorney general i didn't mean
 
02:04:57.669 --> 02:04:57.679 align:start position:0%
to do that to you general john general
 
02:04:59.510 --> 02:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
yeah i think claimant's counsel had
 
02:05:01.189 --> 02:05:01.199 align:start position:0%
started to get at that concept and i
 
02:05:03.270 --> 02:05:03.280 align:start position:0%
think the one thing we would really be
 
02:05:05.109 --> 02:05:05.119 align:start position:0%
adding here is that it we're capping it
 
02:05:07.030 --> 02:05:07.040 align:start position:0%
at the annual salary of a judge but i
 
02:05:08.950 --> 02:05:08.960 align:start position:0%
think making it so that the compensation
 
02:05:11.750 --> 02:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
is our at an hourly rate
 
02:05:13.830 --> 02:05:13.840 align:start position:0%
that's equal and as long as it can't
 
02:05:15.830 --> 02:05:15.840 align:start position:0%
exceed that what the salary and benefits
 
02:05:18.229 --> 02:05:18.239 align:start position:0%
would be total i think that makes sense
 
02:05:20.310 --> 02:05:20.320 align:start position:0%
so i think we can iron out that language
 
02:05:23.510 --> 02:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
but i think those concepts make sense
 
02:05:25.270 --> 02:05:25.280 align:start position:0%
so i assume the working group tomorrow
 
02:05:27.430 --> 02:05:27.440 align:start position:0%
could work out language that meets that
 
02:05:29.589 --> 02:05:29.599 align:start position:0%
and and i'm i'm i'm going to assume
 
02:05:31.750 --> 02:05:31.760 align:start position:0%
there's no opposition to that
 
02:05:34.870 --> 02:05:34.880 align:start position:0%
representative irf go ahead um
 
02:05:36.310 --> 02:05:36.320 align:start position:0%
then maybe
 
02:05:38.310 --> 02:05:38.320 align:start position:0%
i don't think i mean it's nice that it's
 
02:05:39.669 --> 02:05:39.679 align:start position:0%
i understand the calculation but it
 
02:05:41.750 --> 02:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be a straight hourly rate
 
02:05:41.760 --> 02:05:43.350 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be a straight hourly rate
period

02:05:43.350 --> 02:05:43.360 align:start position:0%
period
 
02:05:45.589 --> 02:05:45.599 align:start position:0%
that basically would put it way over and
 
02:05:46.870 --> 02:05:46.880 align:start position:0%
it could initially put a way over in the
 
02:05:48.149 --> 02:05:48.159 align:start position:0%
first year if the guy's working way
 
02:05:50.390 --> 02:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
beyond 40 hours a week so i think it
 
02:05:51.830 --> 02:05:51.840 align:start position:0%
should be capped at an annual rate as
 
02:05:51.840 --> 02:05:54.550 align:start position:0%
should be capped at an annual rate as
well

02:05:54.550 --> 02:05:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:56.310 --> 02:05:56.320 align:start position:0%
i i would tend to agree and that's what
 
02:05:57.990 --> 02:05:58.000 align:start position:0%
i thought we did when we capped it to
 
02:05:59.510 --> 02:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
begin with
 
02:05:59.520 --> 02:06:00.310 align:start position:0%
begin with
or

02:06:00.310 --> 02:06:00.320 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:06:02.149 --> 02:06:02.159 align:start position:0%
represent a lynn yeah can i also just
 
02:06:04.790 --> 02:06:04.800 align:start position:0%
raise an issue i i the i think it would
 
02:06:06.870 --> 02:06:06.880 align:start position:0%
need to be very clear
 
02:06:09.589 --> 02:06:09.599 align:start position:0%
in the definition of benefits
 
02:06:12.149 --> 02:06:12.159 align:start position:0%
that it doesn't include
 
02:06:15.030 --> 02:06:15.040 align:start position:0%
the benefits the retirement
 
02:06:15.040 --> 02:06:16.790 align:start position:0%
the benefits the retirement
benefits

02:06:16.790 --> 02:06:16.800 align:start position:0%
benefits
 
02:06:19.109 --> 02:06:19.119 align:start position:0%
cost of us of a superior court judge
 
02:06:19.119 --> 02:06:20.790 align:start position:0%
cost of us of a superior court judge
because

02:06:20.790 --> 02:06:20.800 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:06:22.390 --> 02:06:22.400 align:start position:0%
you're talking if you if you include
 
02:06:24.310 --> 02:06:24.320 align:start position:0%
that you're talking about
 
02:06:26.870 --> 02:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
75 or 80 percent of the judge's salary
 
02:06:30.069 --> 02:06:30.079 align:start position:0%
for retirement benefits um it's very i
 
02:06:31.270 --> 02:06:31.280 align:start position:0%
may be a little bit high in that but
 
02:06:34.310 --> 02:06:34.320 align:start position:0%
it's very high it's it's very high and i
 
02:06:37.430 --> 02:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
don't i don't know that you want to
 
02:06:39.750 --> 02:06:39.760 align:start position:0%
include that
 
02:06:41.430 --> 02:06:41.440 align:start position:0%
health health insurance things like that
 
02:06:43.030 --> 02:06:43.040 align:start position:0%
that's one thing but the retirement
 
02:06:46.229 --> 02:06:46.239 align:start position:0%
benefits i think probably not
 
02:06:48.629 --> 02:06:48.639 align:start position:0%
okay so two things that representative
 
02:06:51.510 --> 02:06:51.520 align:start position:0%
and lynn have kicked in is that
 
02:06:51.520 --> 02:06:52.390 align:start position:0%
and lynn have kicked in is that
we

02:06:52.390 --> 02:06:52.400 align:start position:0%
we
 
02:06:55.189 --> 02:06:55.199 align:start position:0%
we should have a a total cap i think at
 
02:06:58.310 --> 02:06:58.320 align:start position:0%
the judge's annual salary and that in
 
02:07:00.790 --> 02:07:00.800 align:start position:0%
the calculation of benefits
 
02:07:02.709 --> 02:07:02.719 align:start position:0%
that we would not include the retirement
 
02:07:02.719 --> 02:07:04.390 align:start position:0%
that we would not include the retirement
benefits

02:07:04.390 --> 02:07:04.400 align:start position:0%
benefits
 
02:07:06.069 --> 02:07:06.079 align:start position:0%
the cost of the return the cost of the
 
02:07:07.990 --> 02:07:08.000 align:start position:0%
retirement benefits
 
02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:09.189 align:start position:0%
retirement benefits
um

02:07:09.189 --> 02:07:09.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:07:10.470 --> 02:07:10.480 align:start position:0%
so i'll
 
02:07:12.310 --> 02:07:12.320 align:start position:0%
since you all are going to do a working
 
02:07:13.910 --> 02:07:13.920 align:start position:0%
group tomorrow i'll let you wrestle with
 
02:07:16.790 --> 02:07:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:18.629 --> 02:07:18.639 align:start position:0%
sure sure
 
02:07:19.830 --> 02:07:19.840 align:start position:0%
mr hayden
 
02:07:22.310 --> 02:07:22.320 align:start position:0%
yeah if i got to offer part of the
 
02:07:24.629 --> 02:07:24.639 align:start position:0%
reason for going to a part-time position
 
02:07:26.870 --> 02:07:26.880 align:start position:0%
is that frankly these folks aren't
 
02:07:28.550 --> 02:07:28.560 align:start position:0%
looking for benefits
 
02:07:30.709 --> 02:07:30.719 align:start position:0%
um you know because they have their
 
02:07:33.750 --> 02:07:33.760 align:start position:0%
independent law practice or mediation
 
02:07:35.669 --> 02:07:35.679 align:start position:0%
practice so it's it's not as if
 
02:07:37.270 --> 02:07:37.280 align:start position:0%
qualified people would really care about
 
02:07:37.280 --> 02:07:38.550 align:start position:0%
qualified people would really care about
benefits

02:07:38.550 --> 02:07:38.560 align:start position:0%
benefits
 
02:07:41.189 --> 02:07:41.199 align:start position:0%
so um certainly could could say that a
 
02:07:42.550 --> 02:07:42.560 align:start position:0%
part-time would not be entitled to
 
02:07:44.709 --> 02:07:44.719 align:start position:0%
benefits mr hayden i think i spoke to
 
02:07:45.990 --> 02:07:46.000 align:start position:0%
the value of the benefits not the
 
02:07:47.510 --> 02:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
benefits themselves
 
02:07:48.950 --> 02:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
i was trying to make the compensation
 
02:07:50.310 --> 02:07:50.320 align:start position:0%
equivalent that's why i addressed the
 
02:07:52.830 --> 02:07:52.840 align:start position:0%
value of the benefits
 
02:07:55.910 --> 02:07:55.920 align:start position:0%
okay all right so i tend to agree with
 
02:07:58.310 --> 02:07:58.320 align:start position:0%
representative walls on this one so um
 
02:08:00.310 --> 02:08:00.320 align:start position:0%
but i'll i'll just trust that the folks
 
02:08:02.310 --> 02:08:02.320 align:start position:0%
with draft and language can figure out
 
02:08:04.310 --> 02:08:04.320 align:start position:0%
the right way to carve that
 
02:08:04.320 --> 02:08:05.270 align:start position:0%
the right way to carve that
um

02:08:05.270 --> 02:08:05.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:08.229 --> 02:08:08.239 align:start position:0%
if there's not any opposition i i won't
 
02:08:11.270 --> 02:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:14.950 --> 02:08:14.960 align:start position:0%
all right so now i i cut you off mr dean
 
02:08:18.069 --> 02:08:18.079 align:start position:0%
at the second paragraph of three
 
02:08:19.189 --> 02:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
is that
 
02:08:29.589 --> 02:08:29.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:29.599 --> 02:08:31.589 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:08:31.589 --> 02:08:31.599 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:08:38.709 --> 02:08:38.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:41.350 --> 02:08:41.360 align:start position:0%
31 and 32 that's later on that's the
 
02:08:43.030 --> 02:08:43.040 align:start position:0%
compensation so
 
02:08:44.709 --> 02:08:44.719 align:start position:0%
if you look at the second sentence
 
02:08:47.430 --> 02:08:47.440 align:start position:0%
starting line 24
 
02:08:49.430 --> 02:08:49.440 align:start position:0%
this is a provision that basically says
 
02:08:51.109 --> 02:08:51.119 align:start position:0%
if the attorney general
 
02:08:54.149 --> 02:08:54.159 align:start position:0%
and and us the council for the claimants
 
02:08:55.510 --> 02:08:55.520 align:start position:0%
can agree
 
02:08:57.030 --> 02:08:57.040 align:start position:0%
well there's no need for the supreme
 
02:08:59.510 --> 02:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
court to pick an administrator so really
 
02:09:01.189 --> 02:09:01.199 align:start position:0%
what's trying to eliminate that need for
 
02:09:03.669 --> 02:09:03.679 align:start position:0%
that step in the process if we can come
 
02:09:04.790 --> 02:09:04.800 align:start position:0%
to an agreement with the attorney
 
02:09:06.550 --> 02:09:06.560 align:start position:0%
general as to who might be the
 
02:09:08.709 --> 02:09:08.719 align:start position:0%
administrator it seems an unnecessary
 
02:09:08.719 --> 02:09:09.669 align:start position:0%
administrator it seems an unnecessary
step

02:09:09.669 --> 02:09:09.679 align:start position:0%
step
 
02:09:11.189 --> 02:09:11.199 align:start position:0%
so you're just recommending an
 
02:09:13.750 --> 02:09:13.760 align:start position:0%
efficiency step and and if you guys
 
02:09:15.430 --> 02:09:15.440 align:start position:0%
agree to begin with you don't need to go
 
02:09:17.350 --> 02:09:17.360 align:start position:0%
to the supreme court otherwise if you
 
02:09:18.629 --> 02:09:18.639 align:start position:0%
don't agree you'd still go to the
 
02:09:21.109 --> 02:09:21.119 align:start position:0%
supreme court correct
 
02:09:21.119 --> 02:09:22.550 align:start position:0%
supreme court correct
representative

02:09:22.550 --> 02:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:09:24.950 --> 02:09:24.960 align:start position:0%
yeah we just have to remember
 
02:09:27.109 --> 02:09:27.119 align:start position:0%
that the supreme court is the one that
 
02:09:29.350 --> 02:09:29.360 align:start position:0%
appoints the person
 
02:09:31.109 --> 02:09:31.119 align:start position:0%
okay so if they go
 
02:09:31.119 --> 02:09:32.470 align:start position:0%
okay so if they go
with

02:09:32.470 --> 02:09:32.480 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:09:35.589 --> 02:09:35.599 align:start position:0%
everybody's in agreement with john doe
 
02:09:35.599 --> 02:09:36.790 align:start position:0%
everybody's in agreement with john doe
then

02:09:36.790 --> 02:09:36.800 align:start position:0%
then
 
02:09:39.589 --> 02:09:39.599 align:start position:0%
i would have to assume that
 
02:09:43.990 --> 02:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
the supreme court would appoint john doe
 
02:09:45.910 --> 02:09:45.920 align:start position:0%
so that that's rational if they just
 
02:09:48.950 --> 02:09:48.960 align:start position:0%
forward one name with the information
 
02:09:51.669 --> 02:09:51.679 align:start position:0%
that we've agreed on this please
 
02:09:54.310 --> 02:09:54.320 align:start position:0%
put a stamp of approval on this then
 
02:09:56.390 --> 02:09:56.400 align:start position:0%
it's still the supreme court nominee or
 
02:09:56.400 --> 02:09:58.149 align:start position:0%
it's still the supreme court nominee or
appointment

02:09:58.149 --> 02:09:58.159 align:start position:0%
appointment
 
02:10:00.470 --> 02:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:10:02.470 --> 02:10:02.480 align:start position:0%
is there any opposition to that anyone
 
02:10:05.030 --> 02:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
on the committee
 
02:10:08.310 --> 02:10:08.320 align:start position:0%
so so we'll go on i think we can do that
 
02:10:11.990 --> 02:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:13.669 --> 02:10:13.679 align:start position:0%
then we'll add we'll talk about number
 
02:10:13.679 --> 02:10:14.390 align:start position:0%
then we'll add we'll talk about number
four

02:10:14.390 --> 02:10:14.400 align:start position:0%
four
 
02:10:17.030 --> 02:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
adds false imprisonment as an
 
02:10:18.790 --> 02:10:18.800 align:start position:0%
aggravating factor do you want to speak
 
02:10:19.990 --> 02:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
to that
 
02:10:22.390 --> 02:10:22.400 align:start position:0%
i'll speak to that one uh because this
 
02:10:24.709 --> 02:10:24.719 align:start position:0%
is following my common law theme that i
 
02:10:29.030 --> 02:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:31.350 --> 02:10:31.360 align:start position:0%
so this is uh
 
02:10:32.870 --> 02:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
going back to the core issue of
 
02:10:32.880 --> 02:10:33.910 align:start position:0%
going back to the core issue of
including

02:10:33.910 --> 02:10:33.920 align:start position:0%
including
 
02:10:36.790 --> 02:10:36.800 align:start position:0%
all uh survivors we've you know we've at
 
02:10:38.550 --> 02:10:38.560 align:start position:0%
least for now
 
02:10:41.030 --> 02:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
let go of the fact that
 
02:10:43.189 --> 02:10:43.199 align:start position:0%
false imprisonment would be a separate
 
02:10:46.229 --> 02:10:46.239 align:start position:0%
claim standalone claim for this process
 
02:10:46.239 --> 02:10:47.669 align:start position:0%
claim standalone claim for this process
however

02:10:47.669 --> 02:10:47.679 align:start position:0%
however
 
02:10:50.069 --> 02:10:50.079 align:start position:0%
the attorney general has included
 
02:10:52.629 --> 02:10:52.639 align:start position:0%
the idea of unlawful confinement being
 
02:10:54.229 --> 02:10:54.239 align:start position:0%
an aggregating factor that the
 
02:10:56.709 --> 02:10:56.719 align:start position:0%
administrator could could look at in
 
02:10:59.589 --> 02:10:59.599 align:start position:0%
determining a value of a claim
 
02:11:02.149 --> 02:11:02.159 align:start position:0%
so we've added false imprisonment which
 
02:11:02.159 --> 02:11:03.109 align:start position:0%
so we've added false imprisonment which
is

02:11:03.109 --> 02:11:03.119 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:11:05.109 --> 02:11:05.119 align:start position:0%
really the common law
 
02:11:07.669 --> 02:11:07.679 align:start position:0%
term for uh you know what i think the
 
02:11:08.870 --> 02:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
attorney general is getting at with
 
02:11:11.270 --> 02:11:11.280 align:start position:0%
unlawful confinement
 
02:11:13.270 --> 02:11:13.280 align:start position:0%
there is a definition for unlawful
 
02:11:15.830 --> 02:11:15.840 align:start position:0%

confinement earlier in the definition
section

02:11:16.950 --> 02:11:16.960 align:start position:0%
section
 
02:11:21.270 --> 02:11:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:23.109 --> 02:11:23.119 align:start position:0%
i i would you know i would say a little
 
02:11:25.109 --> 02:11:25.119 align:start position:0%
more complex than it needs to be and it
 
02:11:26.709 --> 02:11:26.719 align:start position:0%
you know it throws up a lot of uh
 
02:11:28.950 --> 02:11:28.960 align:start position:0%
potential defenses that the state might
 
02:11:28.960 --> 02:11:29.990 align:start position:0%
potential defenses that the state might
raise

02:11:29.990 --> 02:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
raise
 
02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:30.870 align:start position:0%
raise
um

02:11:30.870 --> 02:11:30.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:32.790 --> 02:11:32.800 align:start position:0%
now when when we incorporate faults
 
02:11:34.629 --> 02:11:34.639 align:start position:0%
imprisonment that's not to say the state
 
02:11:36.629 --> 02:11:36.639 align:start position:0%
is defenseless there's that common law
 
02:11:38.950 --> 02:11:38.960 align:start position:0%
there are justifications for
 
02:11:41.589 --> 02:11:41.599 align:start position:0%
um you know for a false imprisonment
 
02:11:44.390 --> 02:11:44.400 align:start position:0%
case so the state will have defenses but
 
02:11:46.870 --> 02:11:46.880 align:start position:0%
again this this goes to my theme of um
 
02:11:49.350 --> 02:11:49.360 align:start position:0%
let's stick to the common law
 
02:11:53.030 --> 02:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
so uh help help the non-lawyers here um
 
02:11:54.790 --> 02:11:54.800 align:start position:0%
we've gotten a little used to hearing
 
02:11:58.229 --> 02:11:58.239 align:start position:0%
the term um solitary confinement uh to
 
02:12:00.790 --> 02:12:00.800 align:start position:0%
what extent are these the same terms
 
02:12:02.229 --> 02:12:02.239 align:start position:0%
just said differently or are they
 
02:12:04.629 --> 02:12:04.639 align:start position:0%
different theories
 
02:12:07.990 --> 02:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
well solitary confinement is uh
 
02:12:10.550 --> 02:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
something that might occur at ydc
 
02:12:12.550 --> 02:12:12.560 align:start position:0%
somebody might be placed in solitary
 
02:12:15.990 --> 02:12:16.000 align:start position:0%
confinement it's not a cause of action
 
02:12:18.550 --> 02:12:18.560 align:start position:0%
though it's not a cause of action at law
 
02:12:20.790 --> 02:12:20.800 align:start position:0%
at common law uh to bring a claim for
 
02:12:23.430 --> 02:12:23.440 align:start position:0%
solitary confinement you'd bring a claim
 
02:12:26.470 --> 02:12:26.480 align:start position:0%
for uh false imprisonment which is
 
02:12:28.709 --> 02:12:28.719 align:start position:0%
you know to to to cut to the chase you
 
02:12:32.069 --> 02:12:32.079 align:start position:0%
know an unjustified imprisonment
 
02:12:34.790 --> 02:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
with you know um and and i think you
 
02:12:36.069 --> 02:12:36.079 align:start position:0%
know the the
 
02:12:38.149 --> 02:12:38.159 align:start position:0%
the common law will provide the same
 
02:12:40.229 --> 02:12:40.239 align:start position:0%
type of defenses this is the same type
 
02:12:41.510 --> 02:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
of you know
 
02:12:43.270 --> 02:12:43.280 align:start position:0%
justification defenses that the
 
02:12:45.990 --> 02:12:46.000 align:start position:0%
statement might wish to raise
 
02:12:49.030 --> 02:12:49.040 align:start position:0%
uh as a as they've included in their
 
02:12:52.629 --> 02:12:52.639 align:start position:0%
definition of unlawful confinement
 
02:12:54.310 --> 02:12:54.320 align:start position:0%
uh we'll do representative weiler and
 
02:12:57.510 --> 02:12:57.520 align:start position:0%
then representative walls
 
02:12:59.910 --> 02:12:59.920 align:start position:0%
my feeling is that
 
02:13:03.750 --> 02:13:03.760 align:start position:0%
the original sentence to the ydc
 
02:13:05.589 --> 02:13:05.599 align:start position:0%
could be interpreted as false
 
02:13:08.470 --> 02:13:08.480 align:start position:0%
imprisonment and it's like appeal court
 
02:13:11.350 --> 02:13:11.360 align:start position:0%
going back over why we are sent to ydc
 
02:13:12.870 --> 02:13:12.880 align:start position:0%
and we have to relitigate that whole
 
02:13:14.550 --> 02:13:14.560 align:start position:0%
thing over again i think it really opens
 
02:13:15.830 --> 02:13:15.840 align:start position:0%
the door and broadens everything and
 
02:13:17.589 --> 02:13:17.599 align:start position:0%
makes it more expensive and more
 
02:13:17.599 --> 02:13:19.030 align:start position:0%
makes it more expensive and more
difficult

02:13:19.030 --> 02:13:19.040 align:start position:0%
difficult
 
02:13:21.109 --> 02:13:21.119 align:start position:0%
i'm not in favor of that
 
02:13:24.550 --> 02:13:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:27.270 --> 02:13:27.280 align:start position:0%
i just want to say i've toured ydc a few
 
02:13:29.750 --> 02:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
times and in addition to locking people
 
02:13:30.790 --> 02:13:30.800 align:start position:0%
in the room
 
02:13:33.030 --> 02:13:33.040 align:start position:0%
they have a chair there that they will
 
02:13:34.470 --> 02:13:34.480 align:start position:0%
strap you to
 
02:13:36.550 --> 02:13:36.560 align:start position:0%
and i
 
02:13:37.990 --> 02:13:38.000 align:start position:0%
you know they claim they've used it only
 
02:13:39.669 --> 02:13:39.679 align:start position:0%
when somebody's out of control but i
 
02:13:41.510 --> 02:13:41.520 align:start position:0%
have no analogy when they use it i just
 
02:13:42.709 --> 02:13:42.719 align:start position:0%
want to keep in mind that there's
 
02:13:44.870 --> 02:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
multiple ways of confining people here
 
02:13:46.229 --> 02:13:46.239 align:start position:0%
that may or may not have been used
 
02:13:47.990 --> 02:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
appropriately and i just want to do
 
02:13:49.830 --> 02:13:49.840 align:start position:0%
whatever definition we've got that
 
02:13:51.669 --> 02:13:51.679 align:start position:0%
encompasses not only locking somebody in
 
02:13:53.589 --> 02:13:53.599 align:start position:0%
their room but strapping somebody down
 
02:13:58.870 --> 02:13:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:02.390 --> 02:14:02.400 align:start position:0%
um so my my general concern uh is just
 
02:14:05.669 --> 02:14:05.679 align:start position:0%
scope creep on all of this and and so uh
 
02:14:08.390 --> 02:14:08.400 align:start position:0%
it wasn't included originally uh mr
 
02:14:10.390 --> 02:14:10.400 align:start position:0%
attorney general would you tell us your
 
02:14:14.390 --> 02:14:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:17.510 --> 02:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chair i
 
02:14:19.830 --> 02:14:19.840 align:start position:0%
i understand what plaintiff's counsel is
 
02:14:21.750 --> 02:14:21.760 align:start position:0%
going for here
 
02:14:24.149 --> 02:14:24.159 align:start position:0%
i don't think i would recommend adding
 
02:14:26.950 --> 02:14:26.960 align:start position:0%
this as an aggregating factor because
 
02:14:28.709 --> 02:14:28.719 align:start position:0%
as representative walt said it i don't
 
02:14:30.310 --> 02:14:30.320 align:start position:0%
mean to interpret her comments as
 
02:14:32.870 --> 02:14:32.880 align:start position:0%
agreeing with what i'm saying but as she
 
02:14:34.709 --> 02:14:34.719 align:start position:0%
said there's a lot of different ways you
 
02:14:38.229 --> 02:14:38.239 align:start position:0%
could confine someone that might be
 
02:14:40.950 --> 02:14:40.960 align:start position:0%
some might view as false imprisonment
 
02:14:43.030 --> 02:14:43.040 align:start position:0%
for for instance the use of restraints
 
02:14:43.040 --> 02:14:44.069 align:start position:0%
for for instance the use of restraints
at

02:14:44.069 --> 02:14:44.079 align:start position:0%
at
 
02:14:46.310 --> 02:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
at ydc
 
02:14:47.910 --> 02:14:47.920 align:start position:0%
my impression is that's not what this
 
02:14:49.910 --> 02:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
bill is is going for you know this bill
 
02:14:52.950 --> 02:14:52.960 align:start position:0%
is not meant to sort of uh
 
02:14:56.069 --> 02:14:56.079 align:start position:0%
retroactively evaluate the practices at
 
02:14:56.079 --> 02:14:57.430 align:start position:0%
retroactively evaluate the practices at
ydc

02:14:57.430 --> 02:14:57.440 align:start position:0%
ydc
 
02:14:57.440 --> 02:14:58.149 align:start position:0%
ydc
i

02:14:58.149 --> 02:14:58.159 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:14:58.159 --> 02:14:59.189 align:start position:0%
i
i

02:14:59.189 --> 02:14:59.199 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:15:00.709 --> 02:15:00.719 align:start position:0%
i struggle to come up with a
 
02:15:03.030 --> 02:15:03.040 align:start position:0%
hypothetical where
 
02:15:04.950 --> 02:15:04.960 align:start position:0%
something other than unlawful
 
02:15:06.790 --> 02:15:06.800 align:start position:0%
confinement or solitary confinement
 
02:15:08.470 --> 02:15:08.480 align:start position:0%
would make sense as an aggregating
 
02:15:10.390 --> 02:15:10.400 align:start position:0%
factor for physical or
 
02:15:13.589 --> 02:15:13.599 align:start position:0%
sexual abuse um i suppose if
 
02:15:15.589 --> 02:15:15.599 align:start position:0%
if one were
 
02:15:16.550 --> 02:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
02:15:17.830 --> 02:15:17.840 align:start position:0%
given that these are individuals who are
 
02:15:20.229 --> 02:15:20.239 align:start position:0%
already incarcerated i perhaps you would
 
02:15:22.550 --> 02:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
have one hypothetical where
 
02:15:24.709 --> 02:15:24.719 align:start position:0%
someone was in a locked room while they
 
02:15:27.109 --> 02:15:27.119 align:start position:0%
were being abused and someone else was
 
02:15:28.390 --> 02:15:28.400 align:start position:0%
was perhaps
 
02:15:30.069 --> 02:15:30.079 align:start position:0%
not i so
 
02:15:32.470 --> 02:15:32.480 align:start position:0%
it it strikes me as more of a risk for
 
02:15:34.709 --> 02:15:34.719 align:start position:0%
scope creep than it would be
 
02:15:37.189 --> 02:15:37.199 align:start position:0%
a benefit in in covering claims that
 
02:15:39.430 --> 02:15:39.440 align:start position:0%
wouldn't otherwise be covered but
 
02:15:40.950 --> 02:15:40.960 align:start position:0%
i know i'm not supposed to ask questions
 
02:15:41.910 --> 02:15:41.920 align:start position:0%
because i'm not a member of the
 
02:15:43.430 --> 02:15:43.440 align:start position:0%
committee but i would be curious as to
 
02:15:44.709 --> 02:15:44.719 align:start position:0%
whether plaintiff's council had a
 
02:15:46.950 --> 02:15:46.960 align:start position:0%
hypothetical where false imprisonment
 
02:15:48.709 --> 02:15:48.719 align:start position:0%
might be a
 
02:15:51.430 --> 02:15:51.440 align:start position:0%
an aggregating factor mr dean let's make
 
02:15:53.750 --> 02:15:53.760 align:start position:0%
it a debate society do you want to
 
02:15:55.830 --> 02:15:55.840 align:start position:0%
respond sorry that was just a curious
 
02:15:57.990 --> 02:15:58.000 align:start position:0%
impressive curiosity
 
02:16:01.030 --> 02:16:01.040 align:start position:0%
uh well i i i i don't have a particular
 
02:16:03.750 --> 02:16:03.760 align:start position:0%
particular hypothetical in mind
 
02:16:06.069 --> 02:16:06.079 align:start position:0%
but it's
 
02:16:08.069 --> 02:16:08.079 align:start position:0%
you know obviously i don't it's not the
 
02:16:08.079 --> 02:16:09.030 align:start position:0%
you know obviously i don't it's not the
intent

02:16:09.030 --> 02:16:09.040 align:start position:0%
intent
 
02:16:10.790 --> 02:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
of this change and this is only to
 
02:16:13.270 --> 02:16:13.280 align:start position:0%
aggregating factors it's not to
 
02:16:16.069 --> 02:16:16.079 align:start position:0%
adding a new claim
 
02:16:18.149 --> 02:16:18.159 align:start position:0%
so it's not intent to relitigate the
 
02:16:21.189 --> 02:16:21.199 align:start position:0%
reason why the claimant is in ydc to
 
02:16:24.229 --> 02:16:24.239 align:start position:0%
begin with uh it's just um you know to
 
02:16:26.390 --> 02:16:26.400 align:start position:0%
the extent they had some freedom
 
02:16:28.950 --> 02:16:28.960 align:start position:0%
um to be in a general population and
 
02:16:31.270 --> 02:16:31.280 align:start position:0%
then they are unjustifiedly
 
02:16:33.030 --> 02:16:33.040 align:start position:0%
removed from that and put into a
 
02:16:35.270 --> 02:16:35.280 align:start position:0%
solitary confinement for weeks or months
 
02:16:36.709 --> 02:16:36.719 align:start position:0%
at a time
 
02:16:39.110 --> 02:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
you know i that could fit a
 
02:16:42.950 --> 02:16:42.960 align:start position:0%
a common law claim i i believe um
 
02:16:44.870 --> 02:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
and so we're we're just trying to you
 
02:16:46.709 --> 02:16:46.719 align:start position:0%
know get what we can uh and we
 
02:16:49.030 --> 02:16:49.040 align:start position:0%
understand that we're not going to get
 
02:16:52.070 --> 02:16:52.080 align:start position:0%
a standalone claim here for uh for false
 
02:16:54.070 --> 02:16:54.080 align:start position:0%
imprisonment or solitary confinement or
 
02:16:56.150 --> 02:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
any of those but um you know as an
 
02:16:57.830 --> 02:16:57.840 align:start position:0%
aggregating factor
 
02:17:02.070 --> 02:17:02.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:04.070 --> 02:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
all right i think i think we're ready
 
02:17:04.080 --> 02:17:04.790 align:start position:0%
all right i think i think we're ready
for

02:17:04.790 --> 02:17:04.800 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:17:08.709 --> 02:17:08.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:11.349 --> 02:17:11.359 align:start position:0%
and and do wave your hand at me because
 
02:17:11.359 --> 02:17:12.549 align:start position:0%
and and do wave your hand at me because
there's

02:17:12.549 --> 02:17:12.559 align:start position:0%
there's
 
02:17:12.559 --> 02:17:13.669 align:start position:0%
there's
the

02:17:13.669 --> 02:17:13.679 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:17:15.830 --> 02:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
blocked a little bit okay no i just
 
02:17:17.270 --> 02:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
think that um
 
02:17:19.110 --> 02:17:19.120 align:start position:0%
adding the it's an aggregating factor
 
02:17:20.790 --> 02:17:20.800 align:start position:0%
they're talking about it's not the um
 
02:17:23.110 --> 02:17:23.120 align:start position:0%
single claim and we've heard
 
02:17:25.750 --> 02:17:25.760 align:start position:0%
a number of instances on the claims that
 
02:17:27.669 --> 02:17:27.679 align:start position:0%
have already been
 
02:17:29.750 --> 02:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
brought to court of
 
02:17:32.709 --> 02:17:32.719 align:start position:0%
elongated time in solitary confinement
 
02:17:34.870 --> 02:17:34.880 align:start position:0%
and we keep in mind this does go to a
 
02:17:36.549 --> 02:17:36.559 align:start position:0%
mediator this does go to someone that's
 
02:17:38.389 --> 02:17:38.399 align:start position:0%
going to make a judgment on it i think
 
02:17:39.830 --> 02:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
it's important to have in there because
 
02:17:44.070 --> 02:17:44.080 align:start position:0%
we've seen time after time of example of
 
02:17:46.230 --> 02:17:46.240 align:start position:0%
the solitary refinement being in my mind
 
02:17:47.669 --> 02:17:47.679 align:start position:0%
at least abused
 
02:17:49.990 --> 02:17:50.000 align:start position:0%
as a practice so i would like to see us
 
02:17:51.509 --> 02:17:51.519 align:start position:0%
include it
 
02:17:54.230 --> 02:17:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:56.790 --> 02:17:56.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for that let me let me ask you
 
02:17:59.349 --> 02:17:59.359 align:start position:0%
all a question um are we going to have a
 
02:18:01.589 --> 02:18:01.599 align:start position:0%
specific conversation on solitary
 
02:18:03.589 --> 02:18:03.599 align:start position:0%
confinement or is this as close as we
 
02:18:05.509 --> 02:18:05.519 align:start position:0%
get to it
 
02:18:07.190 --> 02:18:07.200 align:start position:0%
this is as close as we get and the
 
02:18:09.349 --> 02:18:09.359 align:start position:0%
changes that we've put in this version
 
02:18:09.359 --> 02:18:10.950 align:start position:0%
changes that we've put in this version
yes

02:18:10.950 --> 02:18:10.960 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:18:14.389 --> 02:18:14.399 align:start position:0%
okay so um i i think i'd like to conduct
 
02:18:16.230 --> 02:18:16.240 align:start position:0%
a straw vote unless there any other
 
02:18:18.629 --> 02:18:18.639 align:start position:0%
comments um
 
02:18:21.750 --> 02:18:21.760 align:start position:0%
on item four
 
02:18:24.469 --> 02:18:24.479 align:start position:0%
a vote in favor to raise your hand
 
02:18:27.030 --> 02:18:27.040 align:start position:0%
is an agreement to add false improve
 
02:18:30.629 --> 02:18:30.639 align:start position:0%
imprisonment as a aggravating factor
 
02:18:33.669 --> 02:18:33.679 align:start position:0%
the second question will be opposed to
 
02:18:34.870 --> 02:18:34.880 align:start position:0%
adding it
 
02:18:36.870 --> 02:18:36.880 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to be voting as opposed to
 
02:18:40.070 --> 02:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
adding it just in case anyone's curious
 
02:18:42.150 --> 02:18:42.160 align:start position:0%
but so at this point
 
02:18:44.469 --> 02:18:44.479 align:start position:0%
please raise your hand if you are in
 
02:18:46.549 --> 02:18:46.559 align:start position:0%
favor of adding
 
02:18:48.549 --> 02:18:48.559 align:start position:0%
false imprisonment as an aggravating
 
02:18:51.349 --> 02:18:51.359 align:start position:0%
factor mr clerk would you
 
02:18:54.870 --> 02:18:54.880 align:start position:0%
one help three four five
 
02:18:56.629 --> 02:18:56.639 align:start position:0%
five in favor
 
02:18:59.509 --> 02:18:59.519 align:start position:0%
all right uh those opposed to adding
 
02:19:01.349 --> 02:19:01.359 align:start position:0%
raise your hand
 
02:19:02.950 --> 02:19:02.960 align:start position:0%
one two three
 
02:19:05.270 --> 02:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
four five six seven eight
 
02:19:05.280 --> 02:19:06.070 align:start position:0%
four five six seven eight
again

02:19:06.070 --> 02:19:06.080 align:start position:0%
again
 
02:19:09.110 --> 02:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
so so we have an eight to five vote
 
02:19:09.120 --> 02:19:10.629 align:start position:0%
so so we have an eight to five vote
um

02:19:10.629 --> 02:19:10.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:19:12.230 --> 02:19:12.240 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
02:19:13.669 --> 02:19:13.679 align:start position:0%
bullet six
 
02:19:14.469 --> 02:19:14.479 align:start position:0%
do you
 
02:19:14.479 --> 02:19:15.270 align:start position:0%
do you
do

02:19:15.270 --> 02:19:15.280 align:start position:0%
do
 
02:19:18.309 --> 02:19:18.319 align:start position:0%
you want to start bullet six
 
02:19:21.190 --> 02:19:21.200 align:start position:0%
what wait a second
 
02:19:23.110 --> 02:19:23.120 align:start position:0%
yeah there is no five so there's
 
02:19:25.750 --> 02:19:25.760 align:start position:0%
actually only ten issues we have
 
02:19:27.509 --> 02:19:27.519 align:start position:0%
nine issues right
 
02:19:28.870 --> 02:19:28.880 align:start position:0%
there you go now you know the source of
 
02:19:33.429 --> 02:19:33.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:35.830 --> 02:19:35.840 align:start position:0%
so we we did take one off the list just
 
02:19:39.030 --> 02:19:39.040 align:start position:0%
to make your life easier mr chairman um
 
02:19:42.070 --> 02:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
expectation said yeah yeah thank you
 
02:19:44.629 --> 02:19:44.639 align:start position:0%
all right so now we go to page
 
02:19:50.389 --> 02:19:50.399 align:start position:0%
three lines 28 to 32. and again here
 
02:19:50.399 --> 02:19:51.270 align:start position:0%
three lines 28 to 32. and again here
so

02:19:51.270 --> 02:19:51.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:19:52.870 --> 02:19:52.880 align:start position:0%
last time
 
02:19:54.950 --> 02:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
at the last hearing
 
02:19:54.960 --> 02:19:56.070 align:start position:0%
at the last hearing
dave

02:19:56.070 --> 02:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
dave
 
02:19:58.630 --> 02:19:58.640 align:start position:0%
react gave a brief reaction to the
 
02:19:58.640 --> 02:20:00.830 align:start position:0%
react gave a brief reaction to the
notion

02:20:00.830 --> 02:20:00.840 align:start position:0%
notion
 
02:20:04.630 --> 02:20:04.640 align:start position:0%
of having the administrator
 
02:20:06.870 --> 02:20:06.880 align:start position:0%
be the same person who helps with the
 
02:20:06.880 --> 02:20:09.110 align:start position:0%
be the same person who helps with the
guidelines

02:20:09.110 --> 02:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
guidelines
 
02:20:11.270 --> 02:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
actually end up being the adjudicator of
 
02:20:11.280 --> 02:20:12.630 align:start position:0%
actually end up being the adjudicator of
claims

02:20:12.630 --> 02:20:12.640 align:start position:0%
claims
 
02:20:15.750 --> 02:20:15.760 align:start position:0%
and we believe that having someone who
 
02:20:15.760 --> 02:20:18.309 align:start position:0%
and we believe that having someone who
um

02:20:18.309 --> 02:20:18.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:20.870 --> 02:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
having someone involved
 
02:20:22.070 --> 02:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
in the
 
02:20:24.150 --> 02:20:24.160 align:start position:0%
discussion to mediate the discussion
 
02:20:26.389 --> 02:20:26.399 align:start position:0%
between the attorney general
 
02:20:29.670 --> 02:20:29.680 align:start position:0%
and the uh and us frankly
 
02:20:31.830 --> 02:20:31.840 align:start position:0%
would be helpful if if we thought it was
 
02:20:34.070 --> 02:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
needed i think that helps both the state
 
02:20:36.230 --> 02:20:36.240 align:start position:0%
and us to make sure that you know to the
 
02:20:38.790 --> 02:20:38.800 align:start position:0%
extent we think negotiations need some
 
02:20:41.590 --> 02:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
help from a mediator uh you know this is
 
02:20:43.510 --> 02:20:43.520 align:start position:0%
somebody who could be brought into the
 
02:20:43.520 --> 02:20:45.349 align:start position:0%
somebody who could be brought into the
process

02:20:45.349 --> 02:20:45.359 align:start position:0%
process
 
02:20:49.110 --> 02:20:49.120 align:start position:0%
to to help facilitate discussions
 
02:20:51.110 --> 02:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
it's it's really just a way of hoping to
 
02:20:53.429 --> 02:20:53.439 align:start position:0%
try to move this process forward more
 
02:20:53.439 --> 02:20:54.870 align:start position:0%
try to move this process forward more
efficiently

02:20:54.870 --> 02:20:54.880 align:start position:0%
efficiently
 
02:20:56.870 --> 02:20:56.880 align:start position:0%
and you know it would be someone who is
 
02:20:56.880 --> 02:20:57.670 align:start position:0%
and you know it would be someone who is
not

02:20:57.670 --> 02:20:57.680 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:20:59.429 --> 02:20:59.439 align:start position:0%
going to make a decision it's someone
 
02:21:00.950 --> 02:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
who's simply going to offer their
 
02:21:00.960 --> 02:21:01.990 align:start position:0%
who's simply going to offer their
opinion

02:21:01.990 --> 02:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
opinion
 
02:21:04.309 --> 02:21:04.319 align:start position:0%
um to to to try to move the process
 
02:21:04.319 --> 02:21:07.030 align:start position:0%
um to to to try to move the process
forward

02:21:07.030 --> 02:21:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:11.030 --> 02:21:11.040 align:start position:0%
okay so i'm i'm i'm reading 28 through
 
02:21:13.510 --> 02:21:13.520 align:start position:0%
um line 31
 
02:21:15.110 --> 02:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
on page
 
02:21:17.349 --> 02:21:17.359 align:start position:0%
three and and that first sentence of
 
02:21:19.030 --> 02:21:19.040 align:start position:0%
your red line
 
02:21:20.550 --> 02:21:20.560 align:start position:0%
is is saying
 
02:21:23.429 --> 02:21:23.439 align:start position:0%
as i as i read this that uh what you're
 
02:21:26.870 --> 02:21:26.880 align:start position:0%
trying to do is get the administrator
 
02:21:29.190 --> 02:21:29.200 align:start position:0%
in the loop before
 
02:21:32.469 --> 02:21:32.479 align:start position:0%
the um i keep calling in a matrix the
 
02:21:35.270 --> 02:21:35.280 align:start position:0%
the the claims form is built that you
 
02:21:37.670 --> 02:21:37.680 align:start position:0%
want the administrator in before that's
 
02:21:37.680 --> 02:21:39.110 align:start position:0%
want the administrator in before that's
finalized

02:21:39.110 --> 02:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
finalized
 
02:21:41.190 --> 02:21:41.200 align:start position:0%
instead of after it's been finalized
 
02:21:43.030 --> 02:21:43.040 align:start position:0%
that's the key thing you're going for in
 
02:21:45.510 --> 02:21:45.520 align:start position:0%
this sentence per sentence
 
02:21:47.429 --> 02:21:47.439 align:start position:0%
except for the fact that you know this
 
02:21:51.030 --> 02:21:51.040 align:start position:0%
is intended to ra address any concerns
 
02:21:53.270 --> 02:21:53.280 align:start position:0%
if that person
 
02:21:54.950 --> 02:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
would later be appointed to be the
 
02:21:56.870 --> 02:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
full-time administrator or the permanent
 
02:21:58.870 --> 02:21:58.880 align:start position:0%
administrator in other words
 
02:22:01.429 --> 02:22:01.439 align:start position:0%
we think you know we had talked about
 
02:22:03.670 --> 02:22:03.680 align:start position:0%
having the administrator
 
02:22:06.070 --> 02:22:06.080 align:start position:0%
involved in the process of developing
 
02:22:08.790 --> 02:22:08.800 align:start position:0%
the guidelines and we would rather say
 
02:22:10.790 --> 02:22:10.800 align:start position:0%
here okay well it doesn't have to be the
 
02:22:12.950 --> 02:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
administrator it can simply be some
 
02:22:15.190 --> 02:22:15.200 align:start position:0%
other person who would be helpful and
 
02:22:15.200 --> 02:22:16.469 align:start position:0%
other person who would be helpful and
then

02:22:16.469 --> 02:22:16.479 align:start position:0%
then
 
02:22:18.550 --> 02:22:18.560 align:start position:0%
the administrator himself would be later
 
02:22:18.560 --> 02:22:19.750 align:start position:0%
the administrator himself would be later
determined

02:22:19.750 --> 02:22:19.760 align:start position:0%
determined
 
02:22:21.670 --> 02:22:21.680 align:start position:0%
under this bill
 
02:22:21.680 --> 02:22:22.469 align:start position:0%
under this bill
so

02:22:22.469 --> 02:22:22.479 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:22:23.590 --> 02:22:23.600 align:start position:0%
so let me
 
02:22:26.230 --> 02:22:26.240 align:start position:0%
nitpick at the word or the attorney
 
02:22:29.190 --> 02:22:29.200 align:start position:0%
general or counsel for claimants
 
02:22:31.830 --> 02:22:31.840 align:start position:0%
should that be an end
 
02:22:34.230 --> 02:22:34.240 align:start position:0%
no because i'm presuming that either
 
02:22:37.190 --> 02:22:37.200 align:start position:0%
party either side believes that it would
 
02:22:39.590 --> 02:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
be helpful to have a mediator involved
 
02:22:50.389 --> 02:22:50.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:51.830 --> 02:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
do you want to speak represent
 
02:22:51.840 --> 02:22:52.950 align:start position:0%
do you want to speak represent
[Music]

02:22:52.950 --> 02:22:52.960 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:22:52.960 --> 02:22:54.630 align:start position:0%
[Music]
weiler

02:22:54.630 --> 02:22:54.640 align:start position:0%
weiler
 
02:22:57.349 --> 02:22:57.359 align:start position:0%
it seems like it's the same person
 
02:23:00.469 --> 02:23:00.479 align:start position:0%
so okay you didn't agree with with my
 
02:23:02.469 --> 02:23:02.479 align:start position:0%
ruling over here you're going over here
 
02:23:04.469 --> 02:23:04.479 align:start position:0%
and it's a different situation now i'm
 
02:23:06.309 --> 02:23:06.319 align:start position:0%
the mediator before i was the
 
02:23:07.990 --> 02:23:08.000 align:start position:0%
administrator now i'm the mediator it's
 
02:23:09.670 --> 02:23:09.680 align:start position:0%
the same person why would they change
 
02:23:13.670 --> 02:23:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:15.910 --> 02:23:15.920 align:start position:0%
you can respond if you'd like to yeah
 
02:23:18.630 --> 02:23:18.640 align:start position:0%
representative while we're um
 
02:23:20.389 --> 02:23:20.399 align:start position:0%
we're trying to
 
02:23:22.389 --> 02:23:22.399 align:start position:0%
put someone in place to help the process
 
02:23:24.389 --> 02:23:24.399 align:start position:0%
establish the guidelines those
 
02:23:27.030 --> 02:23:27.040 align:start position:0%
guidelines will need to be
 
02:23:29.990 --> 02:23:30.000 align:start position:0%
established before an administrator is
 
02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:31.030 align:start position:0%
established before an administrator is
picked

02:23:31.030 --> 02:23:31.040 align:start position:0%
picked
 
02:23:32.710 --> 02:23:32.720 align:start position:0%
right and so
 
02:23:34.309 --> 02:23:34.319 align:start position:0%
that that's going to be a process where
 
02:23:37.030 --> 02:23:37.040 align:start position:0%
we see things may
 
02:23:39.270 --> 02:23:39.280 align:start position:0%
may run into trouble so here we're
 
02:23:42.870 --> 02:23:42.880 align:start position:0%
asking that simply up to the point of
 
02:23:45.349 --> 02:23:45.359 align:start position:0%
determining the guidelines a mediator
 
02:23:48.150 --> 02:23:48.160 align:start position:0%
could be brought into the process
 
02:23:48.160 --> 02:23:48.950 align:start position:0%
could be brought into the process
so

02:23:48.950 --> 02:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:23:48.960 --> 02:23:50.070 align:start position:0%
so
so

02:23:50.070 --> 02:23:50.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:23:51.910 --> 02:23:51.920 align:start position:0%
it feels to me like there's an element
 
02:23:54.550 --> 02:23:54.560 align:start position:0%
of potential form shopping uh that's
 
02:23:57.750 --> 02:23:57.760 align:start position:0%
built into the ore part of that and
 
02:23:57.760 --> 02:23:59.110 align:start position:0%
built into the ore part of that and
um

02:23:59.110 --> 02:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:24:01.910 --> 02:24:01.920 align:start position:0%
it it it's it seems to me that the
 
02:24:03.830 --> 02:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
attorney general's office
 
02:24:05.590 --> 02:24:05.600 align:start position:0%
is responsible for
 
02:24:08.070 --> 02:24:08.080 align:start position:0%
coming up with an acceptable set of
 
02:24:10.309 --> 02:24:10.319 align:start position:0%
guidelines and that
 
02:24:12.230 --> 02:24:12.240 align:start position:0%
negotiation and discussion and
 
02:24:15.270 --> 02:24:15.280 align:start position:0%
accommodation is part of that process i
 
02:24:17.510 --> 02:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
i i don't know that i'd want it so
 
02:24:22.230 --> 02:24:22.240 align:start position:0%
easily bounced out of the ag's role into
 
02:24:25.670 --> 02:24:25.680 align:start position:0%
an undetermined mediator's role and so
 
02:24:27.910 --> 02:24:27.920 align:start position:0%
i i'll just ask you mr attorney general
 
02:24:29.750 --> 02:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
what what your thoughts are on just
 
02:24:36.469 --> 02:24:36.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:36.479 --> 02:24:37.510 align:start position:0%
 
i

02:24:37.510 --> 02:24:37.520 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:24:40.830 --> 02:24:40.840 align:start position:0%
i think my thoughts are that
 
02:24:44.070 --> 02:24:44.080 align:start position:0%
the a mediator could prove useful in
 
02:24:47.830 --> 02:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
that process at some point but i don't
 
02:24:49.750 --> 02:24:49.760 align:start position:0%
it doesn't strike me that it's necessary
 
02:24:52.230 --> 02:24:52.240 align:start position:0%
to have to give either party the ability
 
02:24:53.750 --> 02:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
to kind of unilaterally bring the
 
02:24:53.760 --> 02:24:54.950 align:start position:0%
to kind of unilaterally bring the
mediator

02:24:54.950 --> 02:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
mediator
 
02:24:57.590 --> 02:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
in i think there should be
 
02:24:59.429 --> 02:24:59.439 align:start position:0%
there's there should be a discussion
 
02:25:03.830 --> 02:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
first and and perhaps a mediator if each
 
02:25:06.309 --> 02:25:06.319 align:start position:0%
so each party feels like that would be
 
02:25:08.070 --> 02:25:08.080 align:start position:0%
helpful um
 
02:25:10.150 --> 02:25:10.160 align:start position:0%
so do we just fix that with changing or
 
02:25:12.550 --> 02:25:12.560 align:start position:0%
to and
 
02:25:14.790 --> 02:25:14.800 align:start position:0%
that's how i would change it i i do i
 
02:25:16.630 --> 02:25:16.640 align:start position:0%
know at least my understanding is
 
02:25:18.550 --> 02:25:18.560 align:start position:0%
there's going to be another item further
 
02:25:20.309 --> 02:25:20.319 align:start position:0%
down on the list that may also impact
 
02:25:22.469 --> 02:25:22.479 align:start position:0%
this item so i i
 
02:25:24.950 --> 02:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
that's i would but yes for now i would
 
02:25:27.190 --> 02:25:27.200 align:start position:0%
change or to and i think that would make
 
02:25:29.030 --> 02:25:29.040 align:start position:0%
more sense than having one party right
 
02:25:30.710 --> 02:25:30.720 align:start position:0%
off the bat being able to
 
02:25:33.110 --> 02:25:33.120 align:start position:0%
bring in an administ uh a mediator
 
02:25:35.349 --> 02:25:35.359 align:start position:0%
representative yes uh thank you mr
 
02:25:37.590 --> 02:25:37.600 align:start position:0%
chairman um it's my understanding and in
 
02:25:38.950 --> 02:25:38.960 align:start position:0%
fact uh
 
02:25:41.670 --> 02:25:41.680 align:start position:0%
janet is actually typing up the the for
 
02:25:44.469 --> 02:25:44.479 align:start position:0%
the three three things that we had uh
 
02:25:47.349 --> 02:25:47.359 align:start position:0%
discussed in caucus but um i i agree
 
02:25:48.950 --> 02:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
with the
 
02:25:51.270 --> 02:25:51.280 align:start position:0%
with the idea that it would that the
 
02:25:51.280 --> 02:25:52.710 align:start position:0%
with the idea that it would that the
administrator

02:25:52.710 --> 02:25:52.720 align:start position:0%
administrator
 
02:25:54.630 --> 02:25:54.640 align:start position:0%
who was going to be sort of the final
 
02:25:56.389 --> 02:25:56.399 align:start position:0%
adjudicator if you will
 
02:25:58.550 --> 02:25:58.560 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be establishing the guidelines
 
02:26:00.389 --> 02:26:00.399 align:start position:0%
but as as was
 
02:26:01.910 --> 02:26:01.920 align:start position:0%
discussed earlier
 
02:26:04.950 --> 02:26:04.960 align:start position:0%
i i i it seems to me
 
02:26:06.550 --> 02:26:06.560 align:start position:0%
that while the while the attorney
 
02:26:08.790 --> 02:26:08.800 align:start position:0%
general ought to get input from the
 
02:26:11.670 --> 02:26:11.680 align:start position:0%
claimants on what the guidelines should
 
02:26:11.680 --> 02:26:12.550 align:start position:0%
claimants on what the guidelines should
say

02:26:12.550 --> 02:26:12.560 align:start position:0%
say
 
02:26:14.870 --> 02:26:14.880 align:start position:0%
the final determination on determining
 
02:26:16.870 --> 02:26:16.880 align:start position:0%
the guidelines should be the attorney
 
02:26:19.030 --> 02:26:19.040 align:start position:0%
general's to make he should make the
 
02:26:20.950 --> 02:26:20.960 align:start position:0%
final determination of what the
 
02:26:23.990 --> 02:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:26.309 --> 02:26:26.319 align:start position:0%
so so if we were to pursue that line of
 
02:26:26.319 --> 02:26:27.190 align:start position:0%
so so if we were to pursue that line of
thought

02:26:27.190 --> 02:26:27.200 align:start position:0%
thought
 
02:26:30.230 --> 02:26:30.240 align:start position:0%
we would just simply not accept
 
02:26:34.630 --> 02:26:34.640 align:start position:0%
the sentence starting at 28 on page two
 
02:26:36.950 --> 02:26:36.960 align:start position:0%
starting upon the request of the
 
02:26:38.710 --> 02:26:38.720 align:start position:0%
attorney general or counsel for
 
02:26:40.309 --> 02:26:40.319 align:start position:0%
claimants the chief justice of the
 
02:26:42.309 --> 02:26:42.319 align:start position:0%
supreme court shall appoint an
 
02:26:44.469 --> 02:26:44.479 align:start position:0%
individual with qualifications to an
 
02:26:47.110 --> 02:26:47.120 align:start position:0%
administrator to mediate the development
 
02:26:49.349 --> 02:26:49.359 align:start position:0%
of the claims process and guidelines for
 
02:26:50.950 --> 02:26:50.960 align:start position:0%
valuing claims
 
02:26:52.630 --> 02:26:52.640 align:start position:0%
i think your recommendation would be
 
02:26:54.469 --> 02:26:54.479 align:start position:0%
just to strike that
 
02:26:56.309 --> 02:26:56.319 align:start position:0%
right and which it seems to me that
 
02:26:58.309 --> 02:26:58.319 align:start position:0%
that's that's sort of you know creating
 
02:27:01.270 --> 02:27:01.280 align:start position:0%
the possibility of an adjudicator to
 
02:27:02.710 --> 02:27:02.720 align:start position:0%
decide what's going to later be
 
02:27:02.720 --> 02:27:04.950 align:start position:0%
decide what's going to later be
adjudicated

02:27:04.950 --> 02:27:04.960 align:start position:0%
adjudicated
 
02:27:06.710 --> 02:27:06.720 align:start position:0%
i don't see any reason to have that in
 
02:27:06.720 --> 02:27:08.469 align:start position:0%
i don't see any reason to have that in
there

02:27:08.469 --> 02:27:08.479 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:27:08.479 --> 02:27:09.510 align:start position:0%
there
okay

02:27:09.510 --> 02:27:09.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:27:11.910 --> 02:27:11.920 align:start position:0%
so uh the attorney general has suggested
 
02:27:14.230 --> 02:27:14.240 align:start position:0%
this is tied into another topic we're
 
02:27:17.349 --> 02:27:17.359 align:start position:0%
going to discuss so i could just defer a
 
02:27:19.830 --> 02:27:19.840 align:start position:0%
straw vote on this until we complete
 
02:27:22.150 --> 02:27:22.160 align:start position:0%
this conversation i think
 
02:27:23.750 --> 02:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
you'll you'll and you'll let me know
 
02:27:26.870 --> 02:27:26.880 align:start position:0%
when we completed that conversation
 
02:27:26.880 --> 02:27:27.590 align:start position:0%
when we completed that conversation
sure

02:27:27.590 --> 02:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
sure
 
02:27:29.270 --> 02:27:29.280 align:start position:0%
just to be clear it's all the uh it's an
 
02:27:31.270 --> 02:27:31.280 align:start position:0%
item that i understand you know that the
 
02:27:32.469 --> 02:27:32.479 align:start position:0%
member of the committee was going to
 
02:27:34.950 --> 02:27:34.960 align:start position:0%
bring forward but but yes i can
 
02:27:36.230 --> 02:27:36.240 align:start position:0%
certainly let you know when i think
 
02:27:37.830 --> 02:27:37.840 align:start position:0%
we've reached the item that makes sense
 
02:27:37.840 --> 02:27:38.630 align:start position:0%
we've reached the item that makes sense
to

02:27:38.630 --> 02:27:38.640 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:27:40.870 --> 02:27:40.880 align:start position:0%
combine with this item
 
02:27:43.110 --> 02:27:43.120 align:start position:0%
thank you so then the second part of the
 
02:27:44.389 --> 02:27:44.399 align:start position:0%
the of that
 
02:27:46.710 --> 02:27:46.720 align:start position:0%
item is uh line 31 starts the
 
02:27:48.469 --> 02:27:48.479 align:start position:0%
compensation the individual show to be
 
02:27:50.469 --> 02:27:50.479 align:start position:0%
determined by the chief justice supreme
 
02:27:52.469 --> 02:27:52.479 align:start position:0%
court and paid from the fund we've
 
02:27:54.630 --> 02:27:54.640 align:start position:0%
already talked about how we're going to
 
02:27:57.349 --> 02:27:57.359 align:start position:0%
write this on a so the part-time salary
 
02:27:59.670 --> 02:27:59.680 align:start position:0%
could be determined
 
02:28:03.070 --> 02:28:03.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:03.080 --> 02:28:07.349 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

02:28:07.349 --> 02:28:07.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:07.359 --> 02:28:09.190 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:28:09.190 --> 02:28:09.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:28:09.200 --> 02:28:10.550 align:start position:0%
so
i

02:28:10.550 --> 02:28:10.560 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:28:12.710 --> 02:28:12.720 align:start position:0%
i think we might be ready
 
02:28:12.720 --> 02:28:13.670 align:start position:0%
i think we might be ready
for

02:28:13.670 --> 02:28:13.680 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:28:16.469 --> 02:28:16.479 align:start position:0%
a straw vote on line six but i'll i'll
 
02:28:19.830 --> 02:28:19.840 align:start position:0%
hold off i i i don't think it's faring
 
02:28:24.630 --> 02:28:24.640 align:start position:0%
well in my view but um so let's go on to
 
02:28:27.429 --> 02:28:27.439 align:start position:0%
line seven do you want to talk to line
 
02:28:27.439 --> 02:28:32.230 align:start position:0%
line seven do you want to talk to line
seven

02:28:32.230 --> 02:28:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:35.830 --> 02:28:35.840 align:start position:0%
okay um so this um this actually is more
 
02:28:40.710 --> 02:28:40.720 align:start position:0%
of a restating of a position and
 
02:28:43.030 --> 02:28:43.040 align:start position:0%
in a comments that dave has made
 
02:28:45.590 --> 02:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
on a number of occasions and this is
 
02:28:48.389 --> 02:28:48.399 align:start position:0%
on page four line
 
02:28:51.590 --> 02:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
seven to ten and so
 
02:28:54.070 --> 02:28:54.080 align:start position:0%
what we have offered here is language
 
02:28:56.630 --> 02:28:56.640 align:start position:0%
that would set the
 
02:28:57.990 --> 02:28:58.000 align:start position:0%
the caps
 
02:29:01.510 --> 02:29:01.520 align:start position:0%
on settlements at the current standards
 
02:29:03.830 --> 02:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
approved under new hampshire law and
 
02:29:05.910 --> 02:29:05.920 align:start position:0%
that's 475
 
02:29:07.349 --> 02:29:07.359 align:start position:0%
000 per
 
02:29:09.190 --> 02:29:09.200 align:start position:0%
incident and then
 
02:29:12.990 --> 02:29:13.000 align:start position:0%
it ties the second one ties to rsa
 
02:29:16.550 --> 02:29:16.560 align:start position:0%
1435 b which is the aggregate cap
 
02:29:19.110 --> 02:29:19.120 align:start position:0%
on settlements and
 
02:29:21.830 --> 02:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
the reason for this is is generally that
 
02:29:23.429 --> 02:29:23.439 align:start position:0%
you know we believe the process that's
 
02:29:25.670 --> 02:29:25.680 align:start position:0%
going to capture the most
 
02:29:25.680 --> 02:29:27.030 align:start position:0%
going to capture the most
um

02:29:27.030 --> 02:29:27.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:29:29.429 --> 02:29:29.439 align:start position:0%
the most uh victims who are going to go
 
02:29:31.110 --> 02:29:31.120 align:start position:0%
through it will give them a fair
 
02:29:34.309 --> 02:29:34.319 align:start position:0%
opportunity to give recover what they've
 
02:29:34.319 --> 02:29:35.830 align:start position:0%
opportunity to give recover what they've
already

02:29:35.830 --> 02:29:35.840 align:start position:0%
already
 
02:29:37.990 --> 02:29:38.000 align:start position:0%
are entitled to under law if they can
 
02:29:40.550 --> 02:29:40.560 align:start position:0%
prove their case and so we see no reason
 
02:29:43.429 --> 02:29:43.439 align:start position:0%
why there would be any need for a cap at
 
02:29:46.870 --> 02:29:46.880 align:start position:0%
the 1.5 million dollars and you know to
 
02:29:48.150 --> 02:29:48.160 align:start position:0%
the extent
 
02:29:50.469 --> 02:29:50.479 align:start position:0%
you know there's concerns about uh
 
02:29:52.950 --> 02:29:52.960 align:start position:0%
amounts that you know are going to be
 
02:29:55.190 --> 02:29:55.200 align:start position:0%
settled you know compromises that need
 
02:29:56.309 --> 02:29:56.319 align:start position:0%
to be made
 
02:29:58.790 --> 02:29:58.800 align:start position:0%
uh those types of compromises will be
 
02:29:58.800 --> 02:29:59.590 align:start position:0%
uh those types of compromises will be
made

02:29:59.590 --> 02:29:59.600 align:start position:0%
made
 
02:30:00.630 --> 02:30:00.640 align:start position:0%
in the
 
02:30:00.640 --> 02:30:01.750 align:start position:0%
in the
claims

02:30:01.750 --> 02:30:01.760 align:start position:0%
claims
 
02:30:04.309 --> 02:30:04.319 align:start position:0%
guidelines process as well as the
 
02:30:07.190 --> 02:30:07.200 align:start position:0%
adjudication of claims so
 
02:30:10.070 --> 02:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
the notion that this 1.5 million dollars
 
02:30:12.870 --> 02:30:12.880 align:start position:0%
is appropriate here
 
02:30:15.030 --> 02:30:15.040 align:start position:0%
i don't believe
 
02:30:17.670 --> 02:30:17.680 align:start position:0%
is necessary and you know we think that
 
02:30:20.070 --> 02:30:20.080 align:start position:0%
this process should have the same caps
 
02:30:21.750 --> 02:30:21.760 align:start position:0%
that the victims would have if they
 
02:30:23.990 --> 02:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
pursued their claims in in a court
 
02:30:27.510 --> 02:30:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:29.830 --> 02:30:29.840 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't remember the details of
 
02:30:29.840 --> 02:30:30.830 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't remember the details of
that

02:30:30.830 --> 02:30:30.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:30:33.910 --> 02:30:33.920 align:start position:0%
475 000 being written into the statute
 
02:30:36.550 --> 02:30:36.560 align:start position:0%
but as i as i recall generally
 
02:30:40.550 --> 02:30:40.560 align:start position:0%
that 475 000 was meant to apply
 
02:30:42.950 --> 02:30:42.960 align:start position:0%
in a different scenario in a scenario
 
02:30:44.389 --> 02:30:44.399 align:start position:0%
that doesn't really
 
02:30:44.399 --> 02:30:45.429 align:start position:0%
that doesn't really
match

02:30:45.429 --> 02:30:45.439 align:start position:0%
match
 
02:30:50.710 --> 02:30:50.720 align:start position:0%
the analogy of this civil procedure um
 
02:30:52.309 --> 02:30:52.319 align:start position:0%
do you know what i'm talking about
 
02:30:54.790 --> 02:30:54.800 align:start position:0%
maybe miss mr attorney general could you
 
02:30:56.870 --> 02:30:56.880 align:start position:0%
could you refresh my memory on where
 
02:30:59.990 --> 02:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
that 475 comes from and your position on
 
02:31:02.870 --> 02:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
whether or not it's pertinent
 
02:31:05.190 --> 02:31:05.200 align:start position:0%
sure thank you mr chairman so the the
 
02:31:09.590 --> 02:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
475 000 number is what i
 
02:31:12.309 --> 02:31:12.319 align:start position:0%
kind of think of it and refer to as the
 
02:31:14.710 --> 02:31:14.720 align:start position:0%
sovereign immunity cap for many civil
 
02:31:16.870 --> 02:31:16.880 align:start position:0%
claims um
 
02:31:18.630 --> 02:31:18.640 align:start position:0%
the state generally has sovereign
 
02:31:20.389 --> 02:31:20.399 align:start position:0%
immunity that protects it from from
 
02:31:22.070 --> 02:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
civil claims against the state but there
 
02:31:23.910 --> 02:31:23.920 align:start position:0%
are exceptions and one of the general
 
02:31:25.910 --> 02:31:25.920 align:start position:0%
exceptions is that the state
 
02:31:27.830 --> 02:31:27.840 align:start position:0%
allows recovery of up to four hundred
 
02:31:30.309 --> 02:31:30.319 align:start position:0%
and seventy five thousand dollars per
 
02:31:34.469 --> 02:31:34.479 align:start position:0%
per incident um that's that's the the uh
 
02:31:36.070 --> 02:31:36.080 align:start position:0%
the sovereign immunity cap
 
02:31:38.070 --> 02:31:38.080 align:start position:0%
so i i i think
 
02:31:41.110 --> 02:31:41.120 align:start position:0%
it's not the 475 000 cap is not meant to
 
02:31:45.190 --> 02:31:45.200 align:start position:0%
be a a settlement cap it's meant to
 
02:31:47.910 --> 02:31:47.920 align:start position:0%
to define sort of the upper limit of the
 
02:31:50.550 --> 02:31:50.560 align:start position:0%
ability to recover for each incident uh
 
02:31:52.150 --> 02:31:52.160 align:start position:0%
for which someone might bring a claim
 
02:31:53.910 --> 02:31:53.920 align:start position:0%
against the state
 
02:31:53.920 --> 02:31:54.950 align:start position:0%
against the state
the

02:31:54.950 --> 02:31:54.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:31:57.830 --> 02:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
the limit in 1435 b
 
02:32:00.389 --> 02:32:00.399 align:start position:0%
is the is a settlement a cap there is a
 
02:32:02.389 --> 02:32:02.399 align:start position:0%
cap on the attorney general's settlement
 
02:32:04.630 --> 02:32:04.640 align:start position:0%
authority uh when the attorney general
 
02:32:07.270 --> 02:32:07.280 align:start position:0%
is looking to settle cases and that is a
 
02:32:08.870 --> 02:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
number that's equal to one quarter of
 
02:32:10.630 --> 02:32:10.640 align:start position:0%
one percent of the previous fiscal
 
02:32:13.429 --> 02:32:13.439 align:start position:0%
year's general fund revenues
 
02:32:16.230 --> 02:32:16.240 align:start position:0%
i i think as i said last time you know i
 
02:32:19.349 --> 02:32:19.359 align:start position:0%
think using that
 
02:32:20.870 --> 02:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
that cap
 
02:32:23.349 --> 02:32:23.359 align:start position:0%
and as an argument for why this cap
 
02:32:25.429 --> 02:32:25.439 align:start position:0%
should be be the same
 
02:32:27.510 --> 02:32:27.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't quite fit because
 
02:32:30.550 --> 02:32:30.560 align:start position:0%
the for the cap in 1435 b
 
02:32:33.670 --> 02:32:33.680 align:start position:0%
is is a general cap on any potential
 
02:32:35.110 --> 02:32:35.120 align:start position:0%
claim against the state that the
 
02:32:36.830 --> 02:32:36.840 align:start position:0%
attorney general might
 
02:32:39.830 --> 02:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
settle and that's it's roughly 4.6
 
02:32:42.070 --> 02:32:42.080 align:start position:0%
million dollars that cap
 
02:32:44.230 --> 02:32:44.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't account for
 
02:32:46.710 --> 02:32:46.720 align:start position:0%
what the specific claims might be or
 
02:32:46.720 --> 02:32:48.309 align:start position:0%
what the specific claims might be or
what

02:32:48.309 --> 02:32:48.319 align:start position:0%
what
 
02:32:50.790 --> 02:32:50.800 align:start position:0%
how how valuable they might be
 
02:32:52.710 --> 02:32:52.720 align:start position:0%
in this case we developed the number of
 
02:32:55.030 --> 02:32:55.040 align:start position:0%
1.5 million dollars because we are
 
02:32:58.469 --> 02:32:58.479 align:start position:0%
looking at a at a fairly unique category
 
02:33:00.469 --> 02:33:00.479 align:start position:0%
of claims and as we've mentioned in the
 
02:33:02.550 --> 02:33:02.560 align:start position:0%
past you know we we did the verdict
 
02:33:04.630 --> 02:33:04.640 align:start position:0%
research we did the settlement research
 
02:33:06.070 --> 02:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
we've seen what's been paid in other
 
02:33:08.389 --> 02:33:08.399 align:start position:0%
cases involving these types of claims
 
02:33:10.230 --> 02:33:10.240 align:start position:0%
and that's how we came up with 1.5
 
02:33:11.510 --> 02:33:11.520 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
02:33:13.750 --> 02:33:13.760 align:start position:0%
the 4.6 million
 
02:33:16.070 --> 02:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
dollar cap again is that's just a
 
02:33:18.710 --> 02:33:18.720 align:start position:0%
general overall cap so you could imagine
 
02:33:20.790 --> 02:33:20.800 align:start position:0%
particular claims that might be brought
 
02:33:22.230 --> 02:33:22.240 align:start position:0%
against the state that the attorney
 
02:33:24.870 --> 02:33:24.880 align:start position:0%
general might want to settle for 3.5 4
 
02:33:27.190 --> 02:33:27.200 align:start position:0%
million dollars but those would be very
 
02:33:29.910 --> 02:33:29.920 align:start position:0%
specific facts very very egregious and
 
02:33:31.110 --> 02:33:31.120 align:start position:0%
you do
 
02:33:33.190 --> 02:33:33.200 align:start position:0%
research on those types of claims in
 
02:33:35.510 --> 02:33:35.520 align:start position:0%
this case we i think we've we've done
 
02:33:37.830 --> 02:33:37.840 align:start position:0%
the research and 1.5 million is the
 
02:33:39.830 --> 02:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
number we've we've arrived at so i
 
02:33:41.110 --> 02:33:41.120 align:start position:0%
apologize that was a long answer to your
 
02:33:43.030 --> 02:33:43.040 align:start position:0%
question no it's an excellent answer i i
 
02:33:45.510 --> 02:33:45.520 align:start position:0%
i just jumped ahead to
 
02:33:47.510 --> 02:33:47.520 align:start position:0%
looking at the 150
 
02:33:48.870 --> 02:33:48.880 align:start position:0%
is is that
 
02:33:50.630 --> 02:33:50.640 align:start position:0%
is that hundred and fifty thousand meant
 
02:33:53.990 --> 02:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
to be the cap for physical abuse only
 
02:33:54.000 --> 02:33:54.950 align:start position:0%
to be the cap for physical abuse only
yes

02:33:54.950 --> 02:33:54.960 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:33:58.630 --> 02:33:58.640 align:start position:0%
and and how you remind remind me maybe
 
02:34:01.750 --> 02:34:01.760 align:start position:0%
uh how did you come up with 150 so
 
02:34:03.349 --> 02:34:03.359 align:start position:0%
within the verdict and settlement
 
02:34:05.270 --> 02:34:05.280 align:start position:0%
research we did with there were cases
 
02:34:07.590 --> 02:34:07.600 align:start position:0%
that involved physic physical abuse
 
02:34:11.190 --> 02:34:11.200 align:start position:0%
claims um as as stand-alone claims it's
 
02:34:13.510 --> 02:34:13.520 align:start position:0%
admittedly we have less of a sample size
 
02:34:14.870 --> 02:34:14.880 align:start position:0%
for those but
 
02:34:16.630 --> 02:34:16.640 align:start position:0%
i don't have the chart with me i didn't
 
02:34:18.150 --> 02:34:18.160 align:start position:0%
bring it but the average that we
 
02:34:20.710 --> 02:34:20.720 align:start position:0%
identified there was from about 65 000
 
02:34:22.710 --> 02:34:22.720 align:start position:0%
to 75 000 per
 
02:34:24.710 --> 02:34:24.720 align:start position:0%
claimant and so
 
02:34:28.309 --> 02:34:28.319 align:start position:0%
while while i i would i think this 150
 
02:34:28.319 --> 02:34:29.110 align:start position:0%
while while i i would i think this 150
000

02:34:29.110 --> 02:34:29.120 align:start position:0%
000
 
02:34:31.990 --> 02:34:32.000 align:start position:0%
cap is fairly classified as a bit of a
 
02:34:34.469 --> 02:34:34.479 align:start position:0%
bit rougher of an estimate than our 1.5
 
02:34:36.950 --> 02:34:36.960 align:start position:0%
million estimate that's how we got that
 
02:34:38.630 --> 02:34:38.640 align:start position:0%
150 000
 
02:34:40.230 --> 02:34:40.240 align:start position:0%
number i think it's a
 
02:34:42.150 --> 02:34:42.160 align:start position:0%
it's a pretty solid number i mean there
 
02:34:44.550 --> 02:34:44.560 align:start position:0%
may be some room to to quibble with it
 
02:34:46.309 --> 02:34:46.319 align:start position:0%
but with the numbers we've seen i think
 
02:34:48.389 --> 02:34:48.399 align:start position:0%
that that cat makes sense for physical
 
02:34:51.349 --> 02:34:51.359 align:start position:0%
abuse only claims
 
02:34:53.670 --> 02:34:53.680 align:start position:0%
so i i i don't want to put words in your
 
02:34:55.910 --> 02:34:55.920 align:start position:0%
mouth but i what i think i i hear you
 
02:34:57.830 --> 02:34:57.840 align:start position:0%
say is that you
 
02:34:59.990 --> 02:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
your preference would be to
 
02:35:02.150 --> 02:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
maintain the language we had coming into
 
02:35:03.830 --> 02:35:03.840 align:start position:0%
today yes that would be my
 
02:35:06.630 --> 02:35:06.640 align:start position:0%
recommendation representing walls
 
02:35:09.349 --> 02:35:09.359 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um i i want to go
 
02:35:11.190 --> 02:35:11.200 align:start position:0%
back to what i was talking about the at
 
02:35:13.670 --> 02:35:13.680 align:start position:0%
the end of our last hearing and that is
 
02:35:15.510 --> 02:35:15.520 align:start position:0%
the purpose of this is to try and keep
 
02:35:17.670 --> 02:35:17.680 align:start position:0%
these cases out of the courts
 
02:35:19.429 --> 02:35:19.439 align:start position:0%
and the caps that we're talking about
 
02:35:22.710 --> 02:35:22.720 align:start position:0%
imposing here to me are a disincentive
 
02:35:24.830 --> 02:35:24.840 align:start position:0%
to use this process
 
02:35:28.070 --> 02:35:28.080 align:start position:0%
because the plaintiffs would be able to
 
02:35:28.080 --> 02:35:29.190 align:start position:0%
because the plaintiffs would be able to
recover

02:35:29.190 --> 02:35:29.200 align:start position:0%
recover
 
02:35:32.150 --> 02:35:32.160 align:start position:0%
potentially substantially more money
 
02:35:34.950 --> 02:35:34.960 align:start position:0%
outside of this process
 
02:35:36.790 --> 02:35:36.800 align:start position:0%
if we leave the caps here where if we
 
02:35:39.030 --> 02:35:39.040 align:start position:0%
take the caps and raise them to where
 
02:35:40.469 --> 02:35:40.479 align:start position:0%
the plaintiffs have
 
02:35:42.630 --> 02:35:42.640 align:start position:0%
then it seems to me like more people
 
02:35:44.790 --> 02:35:44.800 align:start position:0%
might be inclined to use this process
 
02:35:46.790 --> 02:35:46.800 align:start position:0%
thereby saving the state money from not
 
02:35:49.110 --> 02:35:49.120 align:start position:0%
having to hire a lawyer to litigate
 
02:35:50.550 --> 02:35:50.560 align:start position:0%
these cases
 
02:35:50.560 --> 02:35:51.750 align:start position:0%
these cases
so

02:35:51.750 --> 02:35:51.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:35:51.760 --> 02:35:54.309 align:start position:0%
so
um

02:35:54.309 --> 02:35:54.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:35:56.070 --> 02:35:56.080 align:start position:0%
hang on i kind of had this worked out my
 
02:35:57.510 --> 02:35:57.520 align:start position:0%
head let me figure this out where i was
 
02:36:00.070 --> 02:36:00.080 align:start position:0%
going um
 
02:36:01.830 --> 02:36:01.840 align:start position:0%
we're trying to set up a system that the
 
02:36:03.990 --> 02:36:04.000 align:start position:0%
plaintiffs want to buy into
 
02:36:06.070 --> 02:36:06.080 align:start position:0%
and it seems to me by putting the caps
 
02:36:06.080 --> 02:36:06.950 align:start position:0%
and it seems to me by putting the caps
in

02:36:06.950 --> 02:36:06.960 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:36:08.230 --> 02:36:08.240 align:start position:0%
some of the plaintiffs are not going to
 
02:36:09.670 --> 02:36:09.680 align:start position:0%
want to buy in
 
02:36:12.550 --> 02:36:12.560 align:start position:0%
and that is contrary to this purpose
 
02:36:15.110 --> 02:36:15.120 align:start position:0%
they're not if they can recover more by
 
02:36:17.270 --> 02:36:17.280 align:start position:0%
going to civil litigation
 
02:36:19.510 --> 02:36:19.520 align:start position:0%
then it doesn't save the state any money
 
02:36:21.349 --> 02:36:21.359 align:start position:0%
to have the caps on now because they're
 
02:36:22.710 --> 02:36:22.720 align:start position:0%
just going to then
 
02:36:25.030 --> 02:36:25.040 align:start position:0%
go to civil litigation if they if the
 
02:36:26.870 --> 02:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
caps are too low for for their case or
 
02:36:28.070 --> 02:36:28.080 align:start position:0%
if they think they're too low for their
 
02:36:28.080 --> 02:36:29.110 align:start position:0%
if they think they're too low for their
case

02:36:29.110 --> 02:36:29.120 align:start position:0%
case
 
02:36:31.030 --> 02:36:31.040 align:start position:0%
and it's going to cost the state more
 
02:36:33.349 --> 02:36:33.359 align:start position:0%
money because they got to hire a lawyer
 
02:36:35.429 --> 02:36:35.439 align:start position:0%
so it seems to me
 
02:36:38.070 --> 02:36:38.080 align:start position:0%
short-sighted to put these caps on
 
02:36:40.710 --> 02:36:40.720 align:start position:0%
so long as there is the ability to
 
02:36:43.510 --> 02:36:43.520 align:start position:0%
recover under civil litigation so you
 
02:36:45.830 --> 02:36:45.840 align:start position:0%
could have a plaintiff choose not to use
 
02:36:47.349 --> 02:36:47.359 align:start position:0%
this process
 
02:36:50.150 --> 02:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
file a civil suit end up settling it
 
02:36:52.309 --> 02:36:52.319 align:start position:0%
without the caps but even perhaps using
 
02:36:54.309 --> 02:36:54.319 align:start position:0%
the same matrix that's going to be done
 
02:36:56.630 --> 02:36:56.640 align:start position:0%
in this system but they would be exempt
 
02:36:58.469 --> 02:36:58.479 align:start position:0%
from the caps because they went into the
 
02:37:00.870 --> 02:37:00.880 align:start position:0%
courts instead of into this mediation
 
02:37:00.880 --> 02:37:02.230 align:start position:0%
courts instead of into this mediation
system

02:37:02.230 --> 02:37:02.240 align:start position:0%
system
 
02:37:04.630 --> 02:37:04.640 align:start position:0%
so i'm wondering
 
02:37:06.630 --> 02:37:06.640 align:start position:0%
what's the point of the cap
 
02:37:08.389 --> 02:37:08.399 align:start position:0%
if there's an alternative that's just
 
02:37:10.389 --> 02:37:10.399 align:start position:0%
going to cost the state more but give
 
02:37:11.910 --> 02:37:11.920 align:start position:0%
the plaintiffs the same ability to
 
02:37:13.670 --> 02:37:13.680 align:start position:0%
recover higher than the caps that we're
 
02:37:16.230 --> 02:37:16.240 align:start position:0%
currently imposing
 
02:37:19.110 --> 02:37:19.120 align:start position:0%
so represent walls i i i agree with your
 
02:37:21.510 --> 02:37:21.520 align:start position:0%
primary premise which is that if these
 
02:37:23.349 --> 02:37:23.359 align:start position:0%
caps are too low
 
02:37:25.030 --> 02:37:25.040 align:start position:0%
we will have destroyed the entire
 
02:37:27.190 --> 02:37:27.200 align:start position:0%
purpose of this legislation
 
02:37:30.389 --> 02:37:30.399 align:start position:0%
and and and what it seems to me is that
 
02:37:33.110 --> 02:37:33.120 align:start position:0%
there's a balancing act of interests
 
02:37:36.150 --> 02:37:36.160 align:start position:0%
where we want to entice enough people to
 
02:37:38.790 --> 02:37:38.800 align:start position:0%
come into this um process
 
02:37:41.429 --> 02:37:41.439 align:start position:0%
because of the simplicity of it the
 
02:37:44.870 --> 02:37:44.880 align:start position:0%
anonymity of it the speed of it the
 
02:37:46.790 --> 02:37:46.800 align:start position:0%
you know the the trust that gets
 
02:37:49.429 --> 02:37:49.439 align:start position:0%
developed in the administrator's uh
 
02:37:49.439 --> 02:37:50.790 align:start position:0%
developed in the administrator's uh
judgments

02:37:50.790 --> 02:37:50.800 align:start position:0%
judgments
 
02:37:50.800 --> 02:37:51.670 align:start position:0%
judgments
that

02:37:51.670 --> 02:37:51.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:37:51.680 --> 02:37:54.309 align:start position:0%
that
that

02:37:54.309 --> 02:37:54.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:57.590 --> 02:37:57.600 align:start position:0%
that ultimately we we have asked so far
 
02:38:00.550 --> 02:38:00.560 align:start position:0%
the attorney general to weigh
 
02:38:02.630 --> 02:38:02.640 align:start position:0%
the amounts the caps
 
02:38:04.550 --> 02:38:04.560 align:start position:0%
so that
 
02:38:07.110 --> 02:38:07.120 align:start position:0%
the enticements are there but that we
 
02:38:09.110 --> 02:38:09.120 align:start position:0%
also balance the interests of the
 
02:38:12.550 --> 02:38:12.560 align:start position:0%
taxpayers as well and and
 
02:38:14.070 --> 02:38:14.080 align:start position:0%
this this has been the attorney
 
02:38:17.190 --> 02:38:17.200 align:start position:0%
general's i think and his in his staff's
 
02:38:17.200 --> 02:38:18.070 align:start position:0%
general's i think and his in his staff's
best

02:38:18.070 --> 02:38:18.080 align:start position:0%
best
 
02:38:20.150 --> 02:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
efforts to establish
 
02:38:22.309 --> 02:38:22.319 align:start position:0%
a fair and reasonable cap
 
02:38:24.550 --> 02:38:24.560 align:start position:0%
in order for this whole
 
02:38:26.150 --> 02:38:26.160 align:start position:0%
settlement fund to work in the first
 
02:38:29.349 --> 02:38:29.359 align:start position:0%
place and and and i i i just did put
 
02:38:31.429 --> 02:38:31.439 align:start position:0%
words in your mouth but do you have any
 
02:38:34.630 --> 02:38:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:37.349 --> 02:38:37.359 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chair i
 
02:38:39.270 --> 02:38:39.280 align:start position:0%
i would echo a lot of what you said in
 
02:38:41.830 --> 02:38:41.840 align:start position:0%
just in response to representative waltz
 
02:38:43.670 --> 02:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
i would say you know i
 
02:38:43.680 --> 02:38:44.790 align:start position:0%
i would say you know i
i

02:38:44.790 --> 02:38:44.800 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:38:46.790 --> 02:38:46.800 align:start position:0%
from the beginning i think the way we
 
02:38:48.230 --> 02:38:48.240 align:start position:0%
and by we i mean the department of
 
02:38:50.469 --> 02:38:50.479 align:start position:0%
justice have looked at this is that this
 
02:38:52.230 --> 02:38:52.240 align:start position:0%
is an attempt to
 
02:38:54.830 --> 02:38:54.840 align:start position:0%
you know provide an alternative option
 
02:38:56.870 --> 02:38:56.880 align:start position:0%
that that
 
02:39:00.070 --> 02:39:00.080 align:start position:0%
again is is a easier smoother gentler
 
02:39:02.630 --> 02:39:02.640 align:start position:0%
more victim-friendly uh trauma-informed
 
02:39:04.710 --> 02:39:04.720 align:start position:0%
process than litigation
 
02:39:06.870 --> 02:39:06.880 align:start position:0%
and that also provides provides fair
 
02:39:06.880 --> 02:39:08.950 align:start position:0%
and that also provides provides fair
compensation

02:39:08.950 --> 02:39:08.960 align:start position:0%
compensation
 
02:39:10.389 --> 02:39:10.399 align:start position:0%
that said i think we've always
 
02:39:12.070 --> 02:39:12.080 align:start position:0%
acknowledged that this this would
 
02:39:14.630 --> 02:39:14.640 align:start position:0%
potentially for some claimants provide
 
02:39:16.550 --> 02:39:16.560 align:start position:0%
less compensation that they might be
 
02:39:17.510 --> 02:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
able to
 
02:39:20.150 --> 02:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
receive if they if they went all the way
 
02:39:20.160 --> 02:39:21.110 align:start position:0%
receive if they if they went all the way
through

02:39:21.110 --> 02:39:21.120 align:start position:0%
through
 
02:39:21.120 --> 02:39:22.070 align:start position:0%
through
um

02:39:22.070 --> 02:39:22.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:39:23.910 --> 02:39:23.920 align:start position:0%
their their case so if they went all the
 
02:39:26.230 --> 02:39:26.240 align:start position:0%
way through discovery and they they got
 
02:39:26.240 --> 02:39:27.030 align:start position:0%
way through discovery and they they got
through

02:39:27.030 --> 02:39:27.040 align:start position:0%
through
 
02:39:28.550 --> 02:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
pre-trial motions they got through
 
02:39:31.510 --> 02:39:31.520 align:start position:0%
dispositive motions they had a trial
 
02:39:33.429 --> 02:39:33.439 align:start position:0%
took the stand
 
02:39:35.349 --> 02:39:35.359 align:start position:0%
got a jury verdict they could get a jury
 
02:39:37.670 --> 02:39:37.680 align:start position:0%
verdict for more money that takes a long
 
02:39:37.680 --> 02:39:38.710 align:start position:0%
verdict for more money that takes a long
time

02:39:38.710 --> 02:39:38.720 align:start position:0%
time
 
02:39:38.720 --> 02:39:39.590 align:start position:0%
time
it's

02:39:39.590 --> 02:39:39.600 align:start position:0%
it's
 
02:39:42.070 --> 02:39:42.080 align:start position:0%
it's not a very victim-friendly
 
02:39:43.510 --> 02:39:43.520 align:start position:0%
trauma-informed process you know
 
02:39:46.950 --> 02:39:46.960 align:start position:0%
litigation is a contact sport and and i
 
02:39:48.469 --> 02:39:48.479 align:start position:0%
think for a lot of these victims that
 
02:39:50.870 --> 02:39:50.880 align:start position:0%
that process would not be appealing if
 
02:39:52.790 --> 02:39:52.800 align:start position:0%
we went through that process as a
 
02:39:54.550 --> 02:39:54.560 align:start position:0%
department of justice we'd be obligated
 
02:39:56.630 --> 02:39:56.640 align:start position:0%
to defend these cases and and we will
 
02:39:58.950 --> 02:39:58.960 align:start position:0%
and we would defend these cases and we'd
 
02:40:01.670 --> 02:40:01.680 align:start position:0%
we defend them vigorously so i think
 
02:40:03.270 --> 02:40:03.280 align:start position:0%
you know this has meant
 
02:40:05.750 --> 02:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
this is as i think i've said from our
 
02:40:07.910 --> 02:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
perspective it's all about balance
 
02:40:09.670 --> 02:40:09.680 align:start position:0%
you know we we want to provide an
 
02:40:11.190 --> 02:40:11.200 align:start position:0%
alternative option
 
02:40:13.190 --> 02:40:13.200 align:start position:0%
we want that option to be much smoother
 
02:40:14.870 --> 02:40:14.880 align:start position:0%
gentler more victim-friendly trauma
 
02:40:16.630 --> 02:40:16.640 align:start position:0%
informed than the traditional litigation
 
02:40:19.510 --> 02:40:19.520 align:start position:0%
process but with that i think has to
 
02:40:19.520 --> 02:40:20.550 align:start position:0%
process but with that i think has to
come

02:40:20.550 --> 02:40:20.560 align:start position:0%
come
 
02:40:23.110 --> 02:40:23.120 align:start position:0%
a fair valuation of these claims and the
 
02:40:24.469 --> 02:40:24.479 align:start position:0%
only way
 
02:40:26.870 --> 02:40:26.880 align:start position:0%
in the context of a settlement process
 
02:40:28.550 --> 02:40:28.560 align:start position:0%
and the best way i can think of to do
 
02:40:30.389 --> 02:40:30.399 align:start position:0%
that is to look at the other you know
 
02:40:31.990 --> 02:40:32.000 align:start position:0%
look at what other
 
02:40:34.550 --> 02:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
numbers have looked like in
 
02:40:36.309 --> 02:40:36.319 align:start position:0%
in settlements of similar claims and
 
02:40:38.150 --> 02:40:38.160 align:start position:0%
that's what we've tried to do but but
 
02:40:39.990 --> 02:40:40.000 align:start position:0%
all that said i i acknowledge that there
 
02:40:42.230 --> 02:40:42.240 align:start position:0%
may be claimants who this isn't enough
 
02:40:44.710 --> 02:40:44.720 align:start position:0%
money and they think they can get more
 
02:40:46.950 --> 02:40:46.960 align:start position:0%
by by litigating and it's worth it to
 
02:40:48.870 --> 02:40:48.880 align:start position:0%
them to go through the more difficult
 
02:40:50.790 --> 02:40:50.800 align:start position:0%
litigation process to get that higher
 
02:40:53.190 --> 02:40:53.200 align:start position:0%
amount they have every right to do that
 
02:40:54.870 --> 02:40:54.880 align:start position:0%
and while i say we defend them
 
02:40:56.150 --> 02:40:56.160 align:start position:0%
vigorously we'd certainly do it
 
02:40:58.950 --> 02:40:58.960 align:start position:0%
respectfully but we would we would
 
02:41:00.870 --> 02:41:00.880 align:start position:0%
fulfill our obligations to to go through
 
02:41:02.790 --> 02:41:02.800 align:start position:0%
that process
 
02:41:02.800 --> 02:41:03.510 align:start position:0%
that process
so

02:41:03.510 --> 02:41:03.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:41:05.510 --> 02:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
i think representative rogers had her
 
02:41:10.469 --> 02:41:10.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:14.150 --> 02:41:14.160 align:start position:0%
i understand the attorney general's
 
02:41:16.469 --> 02:41:16.479 align:start position:0%
view on this however taking it from a
 
02:41:18.950 --> 02:41:18.960 align:start position:0%
victim's viewpoint many of these victims
 
02:41:22.150 --> 02:41:22.160 align:start position:0%
have waited a number of years so time is
 
02:41:24.070 --> 02:41:24.080 align:start position:0%
not necessarily
 
02:41:25.830 --> 02:41:25.840 align:start position:0%
something that they're not used to
 
02:41:27.110 --> 02:41:27.120 align:start position:0%
having to wait
 
02:41:29.110 --> 02:41:29.120 align:start position:0%
it's been going on for
 
02:41:31.990 --> 02:41:32.000 align:start position:0%
close to 50 years down
 
02:41:33.269 --> 02:41:33.279 align:start position:0%
and we could have someone come back
 
02:41:35.110 --> 02:41:35.120 align:start position:0%
that's waited a number of years for it
 
02:41:36.950 --> 02:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
so i don't think the time argument is
 
02:41:38.469 --> 02:41:38.479 align:start position:0%
necessarily one that all of them are
 
02:41:40.870 --> 02:41:40.880 align:start position:0%
going to look at the other thing is
 
02:41:43.510 --> 02:41:43.520 align:start position:0%
taking an average while it's a way to do
 
02:41:43.520 --> 02:41:45.670 align:start position:0%
taking an average while it's a way to do
it

02:41:45.670 --> 02:41:45.680 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:41:47.750 --> 02:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
i don't think is a fair way in something
 
02:41:49.830 --> 02:41:49.840 align:start position:0%
like this each claim is very different
 
02:41:51.590 --> 02:41:51.600 align:start position:0%
each claim is very personal to the
 
02:41:51.600 --> 02:41:53.349 align:start position:0%
each claim is very personal to the
claimant

02:41:53.349 --> 02:41:53.359 align:start position:0%
claimant
 
02:41:53.359 --> 02:41:54.230 align:start position:0%
claimant
and

02:41:54.230 --> 02:41:54.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:41:55.830 --> 02:41:55.840 align:start position:0%
they've gone through this they have the
 
02:41:57.750 --> 02:41:57.760 align:start position:0%
pain they have the suffering they know
 
02:42:00.230 --> 02:42:00.240 align:start position:0%
what happened
 
02:42:01.750 --> 02:42:01.760 align:start position:0%
i think a number of them will want to go
 
02:42:04.070 --> 02:42:04.080 align:start position:0%
to court if there's a limit i don't know
 
02:42:06.230 --> 02:42:06.240 align:start position:0%
if it's something that we can just
 
02:42:09.190 --> 02:42:09.200 align:start position:0%
take out a cap altogether
 
02:42:10.630 --> 02:42:10.640 align:start position:0%
as a compromise between the two
 
02:42:13.349 --> 02:42:13.359 align:start position:0%
positions but i think that um setting an
 
02:42:15.590 --> 02:42:15.600 align:start position:0%
arbitrary number of 150
 
02:42:15.600 --> 02:42:16.950 align:start position:0%
arbitrary number of 150
um

02:42:16.950 --> 02:42:16.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:42:19.510 --> 02:42:19.520 align:start position:0%
at this point is just not
 
02:42:21.349 --> 02:42:21.359 align:start position:0%
where we should go i think that we need
 
02:42:21.359 --> 02:42:22.070 align:start position:0%
where we should go i think that we need
to

02:42:22.070 --> 02:42:22.080 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:42:22.080 --> 02:42:23.349 align:start position:0%
to
um

02:42:23.349 --> 02:42:23.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:42:25.349 --> 02:42:25.359 align:start position:0%
let the claimants know that we're open
 
02:42:27.269 --> 02:42:27.279 align:start position:0%
to whatever's going on there's some and
 
02:42:28.790 --> 02:42:28.800 align:start position:0%
i don't think the majority of them are
 
02:42:30.710 --> 02:42:30.720 align:start position:0%
going to be on the high end of this
 
02:42:32.870 --> 02:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
necessarily but i think that we need to
 
02:42:34.230 --> 02:42:34.240 align:start position:0%
let the
 
02:42:36.630 --> 02:42:36.640 align:start position:0%
victims know that there's a possibility
 
02:42:38.309 --> 02:42:38.319 align:start position:0%
that there is going to be more and that
 
02:42:39.830 --> 02:42:39.840 align:start position:0%
they don't necessarily have to go to
 
02:42:41.750 --> 02:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
court that they can go through this
 
02:42:44.070 --> 02:42:44.080 align:start position:0%
process that will be better um yes i
 
02:42:45.830 --> 02:42:45.840 align:start position:0%
know the state will vigorously defend
 
02:42:47.030 --> 02:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
something but
 
02:42:49.750 --> 02:42:49.760 align:start position:0%
um that's money in time that that they
 
02:42:51.990 --> 02:42:52.000 align:start position:0%
necessarily don't want to spend either
 
02:42:53.750 --> 02:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
um and would rather go through the claim
 
02:42:56.150 --> 02:42:56.160 align:start position:0%
this this process so i would just argue
 
02:42:58.389 --> 02:42:58.399 align:start position:0%
that we should look to not limit it to
 
02:43:00.950 --> 02:43:00.960 align:start position:0%
the one five and um
 
02:43:02.389 --> 02:43:02.399 align:start position:0%
look at the either the plaintiff's
 
02:43:04.469 --> 02:43:04.479 align:start position:0%
alternative or a compromise of not even
 
02:43:06.550 --> 02:43:06.560 align:start position:0%
mentioning a cap
 
02:43:08.150 --> 02:43:08.160 align:start position:0%
thank you representative walsh do you
 
02:43:10.389 --> 02:43:10.399 align:start position:0%
still have a comment
 
02:43:12.630 --> 02:43:12.640 align:start position:0%
just real quick and that is
 
02:43:15.110 --> 02:43:15.120 align:start position:0%
you know the attorney general set up the
 
02:43:17.590 --> 02:43:17.600 align:start position:0%
scenario where somebody would file suit
 
02:43:19.349 --> 02:43:19.359 align:start position:0%
and they would have to go to trial we
 
02:43:21.429 --> 02:43:21.439 align:start position:0%
know that the vast majority of cases
 
02:43:23.269 --> 02:43:23.279 align:start position:0%
that are filed do not go to trial they
 
02:43:26.550 --> 02:43:26.560 align:start position:0%
are settled and what i see happening
 
02:43:26.560 --> 02:43:27.349 align:start position:0%
are settled and what i see happening
is

02:43:27.349 --> 02:43:27.359 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:43:29.110 --> 02:43:29.120 align:start position:0%
somebody files suit and they end up
 
02:43:31.030 --> 02:43:31.040 align:start position:0%
settling perhaps consistent with the
 
02:43:32.550 --> 02:43:32.560 align:start position:0%
grid that's out there because it's going
 
02:43:34.070 --> 02:43:34.080 align:start position:0%
to be cheaper for the attorney general
 
02:43:35.990 --> 02:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
to settle and not have to pay outside
 
02:43:38.230 --> 02:43:38.240 align:start position:0%
counsel or one of his own people
 
02:43:39.910 --> 02:43:39.920 align:start position:0%
then it is
 
02:43:42.550 --> 02:43:42.560 align:start position:0%
to go through the whole trial and i
 
02:43:45.349 --> 02:43:45.359 align:start position:0%
think that's a more likely scenario but
 
02:43:46.950 --> 02:43:46.960 align:start position:0%
i think if you've got these caps in
 
02:43:49.269 --> 02:43:49.279 align:start position:0%
place it's just a motivation to go
 
02:43:51.670 --> 02:43:51.680 align:start position:0%
around this system and to file suit as
 
02:43:53.590 --> 02:43:53.600 align:start position:0%
opposed to if you raise the caps or you
 
02:43:55.590 --> 02:43:55.600 align:start position:0%
don't have caps in place
 
02:43:56.950 --> 02:43:56.960 align:start position:0%
and let it be the
 
02:44:00.230 --> 02:44:00.240 align:start position:0%
immunity limits then i think that it's
 
02:44:01.910 --> 02:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
more likely that somebody's going to use
 
02:44:03.750 --> 02:44:03.760 align:start position:0%
this system which i think in the end is
 
02:44:05.510 --> 02:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
beneficial to the state as well as the
 
02:44:05.520 --> 02:44:07.030 align:start position:0%
beneficial to the state as well as the
plaintiffs

02:44:07.030 --> 02:44:07.040 align:start position:0%
plaintiffs
 
02:44:09.030 --> 02:44:09.040 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative lynn yeah i
 
02:44:10.710 --> 02:44:10.720 align:start position:0%
i with
 
02:44:12.790 --> 02:44:12.800 align:start position:0%
all due respect to representative walls
 
02:44:14.710 --> 02:44:14.720 align:start position:0%
uh and representative rogers i really
 
02:44:17.429 --> 02:44:17.439 align:start position:0%
think that i i feel strongly that
 
02:44:19.670 --> 02:44:19.680 align:start position:0%
the caps should stay in place and that
 
02:44:22.070 --> 02:44:22.080 align:start position:0%
they are set at an appropriate level and
 
02:44:23.190 --> 02:44:23.200 align:start position:0%
i think one of the things that the
 
02:44:24.710 --> 02:44:24.720 align:start position:0%
attorney general said i think is really
 
02:44:26.309 --> 02:44:26.319 align:start position:0%
important to understand
 
02:44:28.309 --> 02:44:28.319 align:start position:0%
is this and this is this has always been
 
02:44:30.230 --> 02:44:30.240 align:start position:0%
really my concern and i think maybe some
 
02:44:31.349 --> 02:44:31.359 align:start position:0%
other members of the committee's concern
 
02:44:33.030 --> 02:44:33.040 align:start position:0%
from the beginning about this
 
02:44:34.790 --> 02:44:34.800 align:start position:0%
i i applaud the attorney general for
 
02:44:36.950 --> 02:44:36.960 align:start position:0%
having set up this this
 
02:44:39.110 --> 02:44:39.120 align:start position:0%
you know procedure and suggested it to
 
02:44:41.190 --> 02:44:41.200 align:start position:0%
us and for us considering it and i think
 
02:44:43.349 --> 02:44:43.359 align:start position:0%
we should obviously go forward with it
 
02:44:43.359 --> 02:44:44.630 align:start position:0%
we should obviously go forward with it
but

02:44:44.630 --> 02:44:44.640 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:44:47.030 --> 02:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
this as the attorney general said is a
 
02:44:47.040 --> 02:44:48.389 align:start position:0%
this as the attorney general said is a
very

02:44:48.389 --> 02:44:48.399 align:start position:0%
very
 
02:44:51.429 --> 02:44:51.439 align:start position:0%
plaintiffs friendly system
 
02:44:55.510 --> 02:44:55.520 align:start position:0%
if you were if if you were concerned
 
02:44:57.990 --> 02:44:58.000 align:start position:0%
about determining the
 
02:45:01.750 --> 02:45:01.760 align:start position:0%
absolute truth of whether somebody was
 
02:45:04.630 --> 02:45:04.640 align:start position:0%
was sexually abused or physically abused
 
02:45:07.429 --> 02:45:07.439 align:start position:0%
um you would not go through this process
 
02:45:09.110 --> 02:45:09.120 align:start position:0%
you would want and i sort of i'm
 
02:45:11.510 --> 02:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
speaking for the uh from the perspective
 
02:45:13.269 --> 02:45:13.279 align:start position:0%
of the attorney general or a defendant
 
02:45:15.750 --> 02:45:15.760 align:start position:0%
in the case you would want to have a
 
02:45:20.550 --> 02:45:20.560 align:start position:0%
fully litigated fully discovered case
 
02:45:20.560 --> 02:45:21.830 align:start position:0%
fully litigated fully discovered case
because

02:45:21.830 --> 02:45:21.840 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:45:25.110 --> 02:45:25.120 align:start position:0%
candidly there is a i have no doubt
 
02:45:26.710 --> 02:45:26.720 align:start position:0%
that many of the people who are
 
02:45:28.230 --> 02:45:28.240 align:start position:0%
claimants were actually abused and
 
02:45:30.070 --> 02:45:30.080 align:start position:0%
should be compensated
 
02:45:30.080 --> 02:45:31.190 align:start position:0%
should be compensated
but

02:45:31.190 --> 02:45:31.200 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:45:32.710 --> 02:45:32.720 align:start position:0%
this system
 
02:45:35.510 --> 02:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
is plaintiffs friendly enough
 
02:45:38.309 --> 02:45:38.319 align:start position:0%
that there is i i would submit
 
02:45:41.110 --> 02:45:41.120 align:start position:0%
a significantly greater risk
 
02:45:42.389 --> 02:45:42.399 align:start position:0%
that someone
 
02:45:44.630 --> 02:45:44.640 align:start position:0%
who has not been abused
 
02:45:46.630 --> 02:45:46.640 align:start position:0%
but knows that
 
02:45:49.030 --> 02:45:49.040 align:start position:0%
the he can claim something or she can
 
02:45:50.950 --> 02:45:50.960 align:start position:0%
claim something that happened a long
 
02:45:52.150 --> 02:45:52.160 align:start position:0%
time ago
 
02:45:54.389 --> 02:45:54.399 align:start position:0%
where there are no records or very much
 
02:45:56.710 --> 02:45:56.720 align:start position:0%
incomplete records there's nobody
 
02:46:00.469 --> 02:46:00.479 align:start position:0%
perhaps the alleged uh assailant is dead
 
02:46:03.429 --> 02:46:03.439 align:start position:0%
or gone can't be located and it's very
 
02:46:03.439 --> 02:46:04.389 align:start position:0%
or gone can't be located and it's very
easy

02:46:04.389 --> 02:46:04.399 align:start position:0%
easy
 
02:46:07.429 --> 02:46:07.439 align:start position:0%
to claim i was abused
 
02:46:10.870 --> 02:46:10.880 align:start position:0%
and and receive compensation and so
 
02:46:13.750 --> 02:46:13.760 align:start position:0%
i think that is a real concern
 
02:46:15.670 --> 02:46:15.680 align:start position:0%
but i think the attorney general has
 
02:46:17.590 --> 02:46:17.600 align:start position:0%
concluded and i agree with his
 
02:46:20.950 --> 02:46:20.960 align:start position:0%
assessment that because there are
 
02:46:22.550 --> 02:46:22.560 align:start position:0%
a significant number of people who
 
02:46:24.550 --> 02:46:24.560 align:start position:0%
really have been abused
 
02:46:26.309 --> 02:46:26.319 align:start position:0%
and should be compensated it's
 
02:46:29.830 --> 02:46:29.840 align:start position:0%
appropriate to have this very relaxed
 
02:46:32.230 --> 02:46:32.240 align:start position:0%
plaintiffs friendly system
 
02:46:34.790 --> 02:46:34.800 align:start position:0%
to do that but what it seems to me that
 
02:46:36.469 --> 02:46:36.479 align:start position:0%
the cost that comes with that or the
 
02:46:38.790 --> 02:46:38.800 align:start position:0%
trade-off for that is there have got to
 
02:46:40.630 --> 02:46:40.640 align:start position:0%
be appropriate caps
 
02:46:42.389 --> 02:46:42.399 align:start position:0%
and i think that these are very
 
02:46:44.630 --> 02:46:44.640 align:start position:0%
appropriate gaps and although i you know
 
02:46:47.269 --> 02:46:47.279 align:start position:0%
i i think the world of davis and anzo i
 
02:46:49.190 --> 02:46:49.200 align:start position:0%
don't know current council really very
 
02:46:50.710 --> 02:46:50.720 align:start position:0%
well at all but i think the world of
 
02:46:52.550 --> 02:46:52.560 align:start position:0%
david sinanzo i've known him for years
 
02:46:54.389 --> 02:46:54.399 align:start position:0%
he's an excellent attorney and the
 
02:46:57.030 --> 02:46:57.040 align:start position:0%
plaintiffs are in great hands by being
 
02:46:59.349 --> 02:46:59.359 align:start position:0%
represented by him but
 
02:47:02.150 --> 02:47:02.160 align:start position:0%
i have to say candidly i would be very
 
02:47:02.160 --> 02:47:03.429 align:start position:0%
i have to say candidly i would be very
surprised

02:47:03.429 --> 02:47:03.439 align:start position:0%
surprised
 
02:47:06.710 --> 02:47:06.720 align:start position:0%
if there are a significant number of
 
02:47:08.710 --> 02:47:08.720 align:start position:0%
cases assuming we passed this
 
02:47:11.190 --> 02:47:11.200 align:start position:0%
legislation i would be very surprised if
 
02:47:13.750 --> 02:47:13.760 align:start position:0%
there are significant number of cases
 
02:47:16.309 --> 02:47:16.319 align:start position:0%
that aren't adjudicated through this
 
02:47:18.950 --> 02:47:18.960 align:start position:0%
process as opposed to litigation there
 
02:47:20.630 --> 02:47:20.640 align:start position:0%
may be some there may be some that are
 
02:47:22.870 --> 02:47:22.880 align:start position:0%
really bad where there's a really strong
 
02:47:25.030 --> 02:47:25.040 align:start position:0%
case and people will go to uh you know
 
02:47:27.030 --> 02:47:27.040 align:start position:0%
we'll just we'll opt to go to court but
 
02:47:29.269 --> 02:47:29.279 align:start position:0%
that will be the exception rather than
 
02:47:30.790 --> 02:47:30.800 align:start position:0%
the rule
 
02:47:34.150 --> 02:47:34.160 align:start position:0%
uh thank you so i i think i'm ready to
 
02:47:36.550 --> 02:47:36.560 align:start position:0%
call a straw vote uh representative
 
02:47:37.990 --> 02:47:38.000 align:start position:0%
mooney did you have something you wanted
 
02:47:39.670 --> 02:47:39.680 align:start position:0%
to add first i did just have a brief
 
02:47:41.190 --> 02:47:41.200 align:start position:0%
question mr chairman for the attorney
 
02:47:43.190 --> 02:47:43.200 align:start position:0%
general if that would be in order
 
02:47:45.750 --> 02:47:45.760 align:start position:0%
just in terms of some background
 
02:47:48.710 --> 02:47:48.720 align:start position:0%
through the years have any victims filed
 
02:47:50.710 --> 02:47:50.720 align:start position:0%
suit and gone through the process you
 
02:47:53.110 --> 02:47:53.120 align:start position:0%
described with discovery in a jury trial
 
02:47:56.630 --> 02:47:56.640 align:start position:0%
in a settlement and a judgment
 
02:47:59.110 --> 02:47:59.120 align:start position:0%
you mean potential victims
 
02:48:01.590 --> 02:48:01.600 align:start position:0%
at ydc have they gone through the entire
 
02:48:05.830 --> 02:48:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:08.389 --> 02:48:08.399 align:start position:0%
not that i'm aware of i'm aware of one
 
02:48:11.510 --> 02:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
i'm aware of off the top of my head one
 
02:48:13.190 --> 02:48:13.200 align:start position:0%
and i don't have the details but one
 
02:48:13.200 --> 02:48:14.550 align:start position:0%
and i don't have the details but one
case

02:48:14.550 --> 02:48:14.560 align:start position:0%
case
 
02:48:16.150 --> 02:48:16.160 align:start position:0%
regarding someone who was incarcerated
 
02:48:18.469 --> 02:48:18.479 align:start position:0%
so not at ydc where they went through an
 
02:48:20.309 --> 02:48:20.319 align:start position:0%
entire you know they fully litigated
 
02:48:22.630 --> 02:48:22.640 align:start position:0%
their case they got to a jury verdict
 
02:48:24.870 --> 02:48:24.880 align:start position:0%
this was a physical abuse only claim and
 
02:48:26.950 --> 02:48:26.960 align:start position:0%
the verdict was for 80 000 so that's
 
02:48:29.910 --> 02:48:29.920 align:start position:0%
just a just an example but i that's the
 
02:48:33.269 --> 02:48:33.279 align:start position:0%
only one that i can speak to that's not
 
02:48:35.750 --> 02:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
to say there aren't others but it's rare
 
02:48:38.150 --> 02:48:38.160 align:start position:0%
that someone would fully that a case
 
02:48:40.309 --> 02:48:40.319 align:start position:0%
like this would be fully litigated
 
02:48:41.750 --> 02:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
thank you that's helpful thank you mr
 
02:48:41.760 --> 02:48:42.630 align:start position:0%
thank you that's helpful thank you mr
chairman

02:48:42.630 --> 02:48:42.640 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
02:48:44.389 --> 02:48:44.399 align:start position:0%
you're welcome so
 
02:48:46.150 --> 02:48:46.160 align:start position:0%
at this point
 
02:48:48.630 --> 02:48:48.640 align:start position:0%
i think we'll do a straw vote on item
 
02:48:48.640 --> 02:48:49.750 align:start position:0%
i think we'll do a straw vote on item
seven

02:48:49.750 --> 02:48:49.760 align:start position:0%
seven
 
02:48:52.309 --> 02:48:52.319 align:start position:0%
uh establishes the current statutory
 
02:48:54.389 --> 02:48:54.399 align:start position:0%
caps on recoveries
 
02:48:54.399 --> 02:48:55.750 align:start position:0%
caps on recoveries
uh

02:48:55.750 --> 02:48:55.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:48:57.429 --> 02:48:57.439 align:start position:0%
if when i
 
02:49:00.150 --> 02:49:00.160 align:start position:0%
first ask i'll ask if you support the
 
02:49:03.510 --> 02:49:03.520 align:start position:0%
language proposed uh i'll i'll i'll be
 
02:49:05.750 --> 02:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
voting for the second which is to vote
 
02:49:09.190 --> 02:49:09.200 align:start position:0%
opposed to establishing the statutory
 
02:49:12.870 --> 02:49:12.880 align:start position:0%
caps as as proposed by the plaintiffs so
 
02:49:12.880 --> 02:49:14.070 align:start position:0%
caps as as proposed by the plaintiffs so
um

02:49:14.070 --> 02:49:14.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:49:15.990 --> 02:49:16.000 align:start position:0%
so on the first vote
 
02:49:19.110 --> 02:49:19.120 align:start position:0%
if you are in favor of the plaintiffs
 
02:49:20.950 --> 02:49:20.960 align:start position:0%
changes to the
 
02:49:23.590 --> 02:49:23.600 align:start position:0%
the statutory caps please raise your
 
02:49:23.600 --> 02:49:30.630 align:start position:0%
the statutory caps please raise your
hand

02:49:30.630 --> 02:49:30.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:33.030 --> 02:49:33.040 align:start position:0%
if you're opposed to the changes please
 
02:49:45.910 --> 02:49:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:48.469 --> 02:49:48.479 align:start position:0%
so the vote is eight to five for the uh
 
02:49:51.510 --> 02:49:51.520 align:start position:0%
working committee um
 
02:49:54.070 --> 02:49:54.080 align:start position:0%
all right so let's let's do a time check
 
02:49:54.080 --> 02:49:55.110 align:start position:0%
all right so let's let's do a time check
um

02:49:55.110 --> 02:49:55.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:49:56.870 --> 02:49:56.880 align:start position:0%
we're we're gonna we've got a hard break
 
02:50:01.349 --> 02:50:01.359 align:start position:0%
at 5 30 uh and we're also wanting um
 
02:50:03.110 --> 02:50:03.120 align:start position:0%
miss ripple do you can you give us a
 
02:50:05.990 --> 02:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
status on whether or not uh ols will
 
02:50:06.000 --> 02:50:06.830 align:start position:0%
status on whether or not uh ols will
have

02:50:06.830 --> 02:50:06.840 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:50:11.349 --> 02:50:11.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:14.550 --> 02:50:14.560 align:start position:0%
okay so um i'm probably going to end
 
02:50:16.550 --> 02:50:16.560 align:start position:0%
this um
 
02:50:19.910 --> 02:50:19.920 align:start position:0%
about 5 20 so that division 3 has 10
 
02:50:21.750 --> 02:50:21.760 align:start position:0%
minutes to consider the amendment that
 
02:50:23.910 --> 02:50:23.920 align:start position:0%
ols has so
 
02:50:26.469 --> 02:50:26.479 align:start position:0%
i i i tell you that so that you can pace
 
02:50:27.910 --> 02:50:27.920 align:start position:0%
yourself and
 
02:50:30.309 --> 02:50:30.319 align:start position:0%
efficiently use your time
 
02:50:32.710 --> 02:50:32.720 align:start position:0%
um and if and if we have to go over
 
02:50:34.230 --> 02:50:34.240 align:start position:0%
because we're just not done we've
 
02:50:36.150 --> 02:50:36.160 align:start position:0%
already said we're going to re recess
 
02:50:39.510 --> 02:50:39.520 align:start position:0%
today anyways until
 
02:50:42.550 --> 02:50:42.560 align:start position:0%
thursday at 2 p.m
 
02:50:47.910 --> 02:50:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:51.349 --> 02:50:51.359 align:start position:0%
so item 8 is another one for me it's on
 
02:50:54.150 --> 02:50:54.160 align:start position:0%
line 31 on page 4.
 
02:50:54.160 --> 02:50:55.750 align:start position:0%
line 31 on page 4.
and

02:50:55.750 --> 02:50:55.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:50:57.750 --> 02:50:57.760 align:start position:0%
this is pretty straightforward in what
 
02:50:59.510 --> 02:50:59.520 align:start position:0%
it provides
 
02:51:00.950 --> 02:51:00.960 align:start position:0%
it basically
 
02:51:02.950 --> 02:51:02.960 align:start position:0%
the sentence itself says
 
02:51:05.190 --> 02:51:05.200 align:start position:0%
no claim shall be filed by an executive
 
02:51:07.510 --> 02:51:07.520 align:start position:0%
administrative a deceased former ydc
 
02:51:10.389 --> 02:51:10.399 align:start position:0%
resident then presumably that's to make
 
02:51:11.910 --> 02:51:11.920 align:start position:0%
sure that
 
02:51:13.190 --> 02:51:13.200 align:start position:0%
claims by
 
02:51:14.710 --> 02:51:14.720 align:start position:0%
the family
 
02:51:16.950 --> 02:51:16.960 align:start position:0%
uh and the heirs
 
02:51:19.110 --> 02:51:19.120 align:start position:0%
of a a victim
 
02:51:20.790 --> 02:51:20.800 align:start position:0%
don't have a right to go through this
 
02:51:20.800 --> 02:51:22.630 align:start position:0%
don't have a right to go through this
process

02:51:22.630 --> 02:51:22.640 align:start position:0%
process
 
02:51:25.750 --> 02:51:25.760 align:start position:0%
currently they would have that right
 
02:51:29.429 --> 02:51:29.439 align:start position:0%
to pursue action in in a court of law
 
02:51:31.830 --> 02:51:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:31.840 --> 02:51:32.710 align:start position:0%
 
what

02:51:32.710 --> 02:51:32.720 align:start position:0%
what
 
02:51:34.710 --> 02:51:34.720 align:start position:0%
what we added was except by the
 
02:51:37.110 --> 02:51:37.120 align:start position:0%
surviving spouse of the resident
 
02:51:39.110 --> 02:51:39.120 align:start position:0%
uh and frankly
 
02:51:41.910 --> 02:51:41.920 align:start position:0%
um i think that we added this back in
 
02:51:44.389 --> 02:51:44.399 align:start position:0%
for the fundamental reason that
 
02:51:47.510 --> 02:51:47.520 align:start position:0%
when you have somebody who has
 
02:51:50.389 --> 02:51:50.399 align:start position:0%
been married to a survivor presumably
 
02:51:52.150 --> 02:51:52.160 align:start position:0%
that person has lived with the
 
02:51:54.550 --> 02:51:54.560 align:start position:0%
consequences of the abuse
 
02:51:54.560 --> 02:51:55.590 align:start position:0%
consequences of the abuse
that

02:51:55.590 --> 02:51:55.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:51:55.600 --> 02:51:56.550 align:start position:0%
that
was

02:51:56.550 --> 02:51:56.560 align:start position:0%
was
 
02:51:59.590 --> 02:51:59.600 align:start position:0%
imposed on the survivor
 
02:52:01.269 --> 02:52:01.279 align:start position:0%
during their lifetime
 
02:52:04.389 --> 02:52:04.399 align:start position:0%
and in this context i don't know how
 
02:52:06.469 --> 02:52:06.479 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:52:08.630 --> 02:52:08.640 align:start position:0%
in this legislature should tell that
 
02:52:10.790 --> 02:52:10.800 align:start position:0%
spouse that surviving spouse that she's
 
02:52:13.510 --> 02:52:13.520 align:start position:0%
not worthy to go through this process
 
02:52:16.389 --> 02:52:16.399 align:start position:0%
and force it to go to a court of law
 
02:52:19.349 --> 02:52:19.359 align:start position:0%
so so thank you just to speed this along
 
02:52:21.429 --> 02:52:21.439 align:start position:0%
a little bit you know my my thought on
 
02:52:23.190 --> 02:52:23.200 align:start position:0%
that is that
 
02:52:23.200 --> 02:52:25.349 align:start position:0%
that is that
um

02:52:25.349 --> 02:52:25.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:52:29.030 --> 02:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
the surviving spouse um when when their
 
02:52:31.830 --> 02:52:31.840 align:start position:0%
spouse dies they die with the and the
 
02:52:34.309 --> 02:52:34.319 align:start position:0%
pain goes with them they the the
 
02:52:36.230 --> 02:52:36.240 align:start position:0%
surviving spouse
 
02:52:37.510 --> 02:52:37.520 align:start position:0%
was not the
 
02:52:40.790 --> 02:52:40.800 align:start position:0%
direct recipient of the of the pain and
 
02:52:42.550 --> 02:52:42.560 align:start position:0%
anguish and the suffering
 
02:52:44.790 --> 02:52:44.800 align:start position:0%
it was secondary and so
 
02:52:47.830 --> 02:52:47.840 align:start position:0%
so the pain largely dies with the with
 
02:52:49.429 --> 02:52:49.439 align:start position:0%
the um
 
02:52:51.670 --> 02:52:51.680 align:start position:0%
the one that was incarcerated and abused
 
02:52:53.349 --> 02:52:53.359 align:start position:0%
the other is that
 
02:52:56.230 --> 02:52:56.240 align:start position:0%
with with that individual dies the
 
02:52:58.870 --> 02:52:58.880 align:start position:0%
direct testimony and observation and so
 
02:53:00.950 --> 02:53:00.960 align:start position:0%
everything gets to become second hand
 
02:53:02.230 --> 02:53:02.240 align:start position:0%
and hearsay
 
02:53:04.790 --> 02:53:04.800 align:start position:0%
i i just think that just adds too much
 
02:53:07.349 --> 02:53:07.359 align:start position:0%
complexity and i i wouldn't be in favor
 
02:53:10.790 --> 02:53:10.800 align:start position:0%
of adding the surviving spouse i i know
 
02:53:13.670 --> 02:53:13.680 align:start position:0%
it's tragic to lose a spouse but i i
 
02:53:15.269 --> 02:53:15.279 align:start position:0%
don't know that this is the remedy for
 
02:53:17.910 --> 02:53:17.920 align:start position:0%
that so uh or is there any other
 
02:53:19.750 --> 02:53:19.760 align:start position:0%
commentary from anyone on that uh
 
02:53:21.510 --> 02:53:21.520 align:start position:0%
representative walner
 
02:53:27.030 --> 02:53:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:30.309 --> 02:53:30.319 align:start position:0%
a claimant had started the process
 
02:53:35.429 --> 02:53:35.439 align:start position:0%
and died before the process was complete
 
02:53:36.830 --> 02:53:36.840 align:start position:0%
and they
 
02:53:38.950 --> 02:53:38.960 align:start position:0%
were they were
 
02:53:42.309 --> 02:53:42.319 align:start position:0%
left a spouse and family so how would
 
02:53:45.429 --> 02:53:45.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:45.439 --> 02:53:46.309 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:53:46.309 --> 02:53:46.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:53:48.230 --> 02:53:48.240 align:start position:0%
i would say based upon the way it's
 
02:53:49.190 --> 02:53:49.200 align:start position:0%
written now
 
02:53:50.950 --> 02:53:50.960 align:start position:0%
it's measured at the time the claim is
 
02:53:53.910 --> 02:53:53.920 align:start position:0%
filed so i would the attorney general
 
02:53:55.110 --> 02:53:55.120 align:start position:0%
might have a different opinion but i
 
02:53:56.950 --> 02:53:56.960 align:start position:0%
would assume that that claim could
 
02:53:56.960 --> 02:53:58.150 align:start position:0%
would assume that that claim could
continue

02:53:58.150 --> 02:53:58.160 align:start position:0%
continue
 
02:54:00.950 --> 02:54:00.960 align:start position:0%
um but i do
 
02:54:00.960 --> 02:54:02.630 align:start position:0%
um but i do
yeah

02:54:02.630 --> 02:54:02.640 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:54:04.230 --> 02:54:04.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:54:08.630 --> 02:54:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:11.429 --> 02:54:11.439 align:start position:0%
i see room for problems here
 
02:54:13.349 --> 02:54:13.359 align:start position:0%
a person who's not otherwise attractive
 
02:54:15.590 --> 02:54:15.600 align:start position:0%
who's got an ongoing case
 
02:54:17.190 --> 02:54:17.200 align:start position:0%
trying to get some woman to marry him
 
02:54:17.200 --> 02:54:18.950 align:start position:0%
trying to get some woman to marry him
hey

02:54:18.950 --> 02:54:18.960 align:start position:0%
hey
 
02:54:21.110 --> 02:54:21.120 align:start position:0%
i've got stage four cancer you marry me
 
02:54:23.190 --> 02:54:23.200 align:start position:0%
you're in for payoff at some point
 
02:54:26.150 --> 02:54:26.160 align:start position:0%
whether i get this money or not
 
02:54:27.429 --> 02:54:27.439 align:start position:0%
i'm just saying
 
02:54:28.870 --> 02:54:28.880 align:start position:0%
it's not always an honest thing we're
 
02:54:33.110 --> 02:54:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:35.349 --> 02:54:35.359 align:start position:0%
so i i think representative waller just
 
02:54:37.030 --> 02:54:37.040 align:start position:0%
erased a really good question that i
 
02:54:39.910 --> 02:54:39.920 align:start position:0%
hadn't thought of what what what happens
 
02:54:41.910 --> 02:54:41.920 align:start position:0%
to the status of the claim
 
02:54:44.550 --> 02:54:44.560 align:start position:0%
if the person filing the claim dies
 
02:54:46.950 --> 02:54:46.960 align:start position:0%
before the administrator finishes the
 
02:54:46.960 --> 02:54:49.269 align:start position:0%
before the administrator finishes the
paperwork

02:54:49.269 --> 02:54:49.279 align:start position:0%
paperwork
 
02:54:50.870 --> 02:54:50.880 align:start position:0%
i think the the way i've sort of
 
02:54:52.150 --> 02:54:52.160 align:start position:0%
envisioned it in the way i would read
 
02:54:54.150 --> 02:54:54.160 align:start position:0%
the statute is that once the claim is
 
02:54:54.160 --> 02:54:55.590 align:start position:0%
the statute is that once the claim is
filed

02:54:55.590 --> 02:54:55.600 align:start position:0%
filed
 
02:54:56.710 --> 02:54:56.720 align:start position:0%
it could
 
02:54:59.510 --> 02:54:59.520 align:start position:0%
the claim's been filed so if someone
 
02:55:01.830 --> 02:55:01.840 align:start position:0%
passes away before it's been fully
 
02:55:04.230 --> 02:55:04.240 align:start position:0%
adjudicated that doesn't destroy the
 
02:55:07.349 --> 02:55:07.359 align:start position:0%
claim i mean i think it may affect
 
02:55:09.750 --> 02:55:09.760 align:start position:0%
where the ultimate decision comes out
 
02:55:11.590 --> 02:55:11.600 align:start position:0%
because it might affect
 
02:55:13.910 --> 02:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
what's available to
 
02:55:16.389 --> 02:55:16.399 align:start position:0%
to both the administrator and and
 
02:55:19.830 --> 02:55:19.840 align:start position:0%
perhaps the deceased counsel and the ag
 
02:55:21.269 --> 02:55:21.279 align:start position:0%
when it comes to verifying and getting
 
02:55:22.630 --> 02:55:22.640 align:start position:0%
the facts so it could affect the
 
02:55:23.990 --> 02:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
ultimate value
 
02:55:25.990 --> 02:55:26.000 align:start position:0%
but but from my perspective i think the
 
02:55:28.630 --> 02:55:28.640 align:start position:0%
cutoff is is at the claim filing and i
 
02:55:30.710 --> 02:55:30.720 align:start position:0%
think that gets to the
 
02:55:32.870 --> 02:55:32.880 align:start position:0%
what i see is the primary concern which
 
02:55:34.469 --> 02:55:34.479 align:start position:0%
is that without
 
02:55:35.750 --> 02:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
the victim
 
02:55:38.230 --> 02:55:38.240 align:start position:0%
having filed the claim you don't have a
 
02:55:41.190 --> 02:55:41.200 align:start position:0%
direct statement from the victim and
 
02:55:44.550 --> 02:55:44.560 align:start position:0%
these claims are hard enough to to sort
 
02:55:46.550 --> 02:55:46.560 align:start position:0%
through and verify given how old they
 
02:55:48.150 --> 02:55:48.160 align:start position:0%
are without having that direct statement
 
02:55:50.070 --> 02:55:50.080 align:start position:0%
from the victim makes it difficult but
 
02:55:52.630 --> 02:55:52.640 align:start position:0%
that same concern isn't there if a claim
 
02:55:54.710 --> 02:55:54.720 align:start position:0%
has been filed by the victim and they
 
02:55:57.349 --> 02:55:57.359 align:start position:0%
only pass away after the claim has been
 
02:55:59.830 --> 02:55:59.840 align:start position:0%
filed so my next question then for you
 
02:56:02.469 --> 02:56:02.479 align:start position:0%
is uh do you think the language in the
 
02:56:06.469 --> 02:56:06.479 align:start position:0%
bill is clear on the status of the claim
 
02:56:07.590 --> 02:56:07.600 align:start position:0%
should the
 
02:56:11.750 --> 02:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:15.190 --> 02:56:15.200 align:start position:0%
it probably isn't clear enough so if
 
02:56:16.630 --> 02:56:16.640 align:start position:0%
um i mean i'll
 
02:56:18.230 --> 02:56:18.240 align:start position:0%
to be honest i hadn't thought about that
 
02:56:20.309 --> 02:56:20.319 align:start position:0%
coming in today but it sounds like there
 
02:56:21.990 --> 02:56:22.000 align:start position:0%
may be room for clarification which we'd
 
02:56:24.550 --> 02:56:24.560 align:start position:0%
be happy to work on some language for if
 
02:56:27.830 --> 02:56:27.840 align:start position:0%
it is the the the committee's
 
02:56:30.070 --> 02:56:30.080 align:start position:0%
desire that that actually be the case
 
02:56:31.910 --> 02:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
that's how i've read the language
 
02:56:34.230 --> 02:56:34.240 align:start position:0%
assuming the committee is in agreement
 
02:56:36.469 --> 02:56:36.479 align:start position:0%
with that we i can certainly work on
 
02:56:38.870 --> 02:56:38.880 align:start position:0%
some language with kevin to to clarify
 
02:56:41.590 --> 02:56:41.600 align:start position:0%
that so so mr dean and mr hayden if if
 
02:56:45.990 --> 02:56:46.000 align:start position:0%
we were um to uh clarify the language
 
02:56:48.710 --> 02:56:48.720 align:start position:0%
as we've discussed here um would you
 
02:56:50.790 --> 02:56:50.800 align:start position:0%
would that meet your
 
02:56:53.030 --> 02:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
your interests
 
02:56:55.670 --> 02:56:55.680 align:start position:0%
or or are you wanting to be able to will
 
02:56:58.550 --> 02:56:58.560 align:start position:0%
a claim to somebody
 
02:56:59.910 --> 02:56:59.920 align:start position:0%
after the
 
02:57:01.830 --> 02:57:01.840 align:start position:0%
when there's no longer a time for them
 
02:57:05.349 --> 02:57:05.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:08.950 --> 02:57:08.960 align:start position:0%
uh so those changes would be helpful and
 
02:57:11.269 --> 02:57:11.279 align:start position:0%
um we would agree we certainly think
 
02:57:13.110 --> 02:57:13.120 align:start position:0%
they go in the right direction and if
 
02:57:15.750 --> 02:57:15.760 align:start position:0%
particularly for clarification however
 
02:57:16.550 --> 02:57:16.560 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:57:18.630 --> 02:57:18.640 align:start position:0%
we're not asking for the complete
 
02:57:21.190 --> 02:57:21.200 align:start position:0%
ability to will a claim we're talking
 
02:57:24.389 --> 02:57:24.399 align:start position:0%
about a surviving spouse who may
 
02:57:26.550 --> 02:57:26.560 align:start position:0%
you know in legal terms inherited by a
 
02:57:28.389 --> 02:57:28.399 align:start position:0%
will or under the
 
02:57:28.399 --> 02:57:29.110 align:start position:0%
will or under the
the

02:57:29.110 --> 02:57:29.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:57:30.870 --> 02:57:30.880 align:start position:0%
laws of intestacy in the state of new
 
02:57:30.880 --> 02:57:32.790 align:start position:0%
laws of intestacy in the state of new
hampshire

02:57:32.790 --> 02:57:32.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
02:57:35.750 --> 02:57:35.760 align:start position:0%
but you would limit that to only um
 
02:57:38.389 --> 02:57:38.399 align:start position:0%
remuneration that would fall
 
02:57:40.790 --> 02:57:40.800 align:start position:0%
after the claim had already been filed
 
02:57:42.710 --> 02:57:42.720 align:start position:0%
by the living
 
02:57:45.190 --> 02:57:45.200 align:start position:0%
victim right i i agree with that in
 
02:57:46.389 --> 02:57:46.399 align:start position:0%
concept yes
 
02:57:48.389 --> 02:57:48.399 align:start position:0%
okay so i don't see any disagreement
 
02:57:50.469 --> 02:57:50.479 align:start position:0%
it's just words that need to be written
 
02:57:53.910 --> 02:57:53.920 align:start position:0%
to clarify so i i think we'll forego a
 
02:57:55.830 --> 02:57:55.840 align:start position:0%
straw vote on that unless there's any
 
02:57:58.469 --> 02:57:58.479 align:start position:0%
opposition to just assuming
 
02:58:00.550 --> 02:58:00.560 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:58:02.150 --> 02:58:02.160 align:start position:0%
let's go to
 
02:58:04.469 --> 02:58:04.479 align:start position:0%
item 9
 
02:58:06.870 --> 02:58:06.880 align:start position:0%
reminds a victim of his or her rights at
 
02:58:13.830 --> 02:58:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:13.840 --> 02:58:15.590 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:58:15.590 --> 02:58:15.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:58:19.830 --> 02:58:19.840 align:start position:0%
item 9 is page seven lines four to six
 
02:58:23.030 --> 02:58:23.040 align:start position:0%
um and this is this is i think
 
02:58:24.710 --> 02:58:24.720 align:start position:0%
an attempt
 
02:58:26.389 --> 02:58:26.399 align:start position:0%
to try to
 
02:58:29.349 --> 02:58:29.359 align:start position:0%
address the practicalities of a process
 
02:58:31.510 --> 02:58:31.520 align:start position:0%
and you know i believe this bill
 
02:58:34.389 --> 02:58:34.399 align:start position:0%
contemplates that you know claimants may
 
02:58:37.510 --> 02:58:37.520 align:start position:0%
get a final offer from
 
02:58:39.349 --> 02:58:39.359 align:start position:0%
the attorney general's
 
02:58:42.389 --> 02:58:42.399 align:start position:0%
designee and not respond for one reason
 
02:58:43.910 --> 02:58:43.920 align:start position:0%
or another
 
02:58:46.309 --> 02:58:46.319 align:start position:0%
and i understand the practical side of
 
02:58:46.319 --> 02:58:48.230 align:start position:0%
and i understand the practical side of
that

02:58:48.230 --> 02:58:48.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:58:49.429 --> 02:58:49.439 align:start position:0%
of that
 
02:58:53.349 --> 02:58:53.359 align:start position:0%
type of deemed acceptance if you will
 
02:58:55.670 --> 02:58:55.680 align:start position:0%
we put language in there that really is
 
02:58:57.750 --> 02:58:57.760 align:start position:0%
duplicated below that says
 
02:58:59.990 --> 02:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
you know effectively the administrator
 
02:59:01.349 --> 02:59:01.359 align:start position:0%
can assume
 
02:59:03.910 --> 02:59:03.920 align:start position:0%
that they accept it but it just makes it
 
02:59:05.590 --> 02:59:05.600 align:start position:0%
needs to be clear that somewhere in the
 
02:59:07.670 --> 02:59:07.680 align:start position:0%
process when they were notified of the
 
02:59:11.030 --> 02:59:11.040 align:start position:0%
award they were had fair notice of what
 
02:59:11.040 --> 02:59:11.910 align:start position:0%
award they were had fair notice of what
their

02:59:11.910 --> 02:59:11.920 align:start position:0%
their
 
02:59:14.950 --> 02:59:14.960 align:start position:0%
rights were under this process and
 
02:59:17.349 --> 02:59:17.359 align:start position:0%
this is exactly the same language set
 
02:59:17.359 --> 02:59:18.550 align:start position:0%
this is exactly the same language set
forth

02:59:18.550 --> 02:59:18.560 align:start position:0%
forth
 
02:59:18.560 --> 02:59:21.910 align:start position:0%
forth
below

02:59:21.910 --> 02:59:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:23.349 --> 02:59:23.359 align:start position:0%
uh where is it
 
02:59:27.269 --> 02:59:27.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:31.510 --> 02:59:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:32.950 --> 02:59:32.960 align:start position:0%
no it's not that that's not where it is
 
02:59:34.469 --> 02:59:34.479 align:start position:0%
but it's definitely
 
02:59:36.790 --> 02:59:36.800 align:start position:0%
as i recall a conversation from this one
 
02:59:38.710 --> 02:59:38.720 align:start position:0%
last week um
 
02:59:38.720 --> 02:59:40.150 align:start position:0%
last week um
plaintiff's

02:59:40.150 --> 02:59:40.160 align:start position:0%
plaintiff's
 
02:59:40.160 --> 02:59:41.510 align:start position:0%
plaintiff's
counsel

02:59:41.510 --> 02:59:41.520 align:start position:0%
counsel
 
02:59:43.830 --> 02:59:43.840 align:start position:0%
accepted the idea that uh
 
02:59:45.990 --> 02:59:46.000 align:start position:0%
documenting it in writing
 
02:59:47.590 --> 02:59:47.600 align:start position:0%
may may not
 
02:59:50.469 --> 02:59:50.479 align:start position:0%
may be going too far that maybe a verbal
 
02:59:51.990 --> 02:59:52.000 align:start position:0%
kind of communication would be
 
02:59:54.790 --> 02:59:54.800 align:start position:0%
sufficient this this this writes and
 
02:59:57.750 --> 02:59:57.760 align:start position:0%
that it be put in writing
 
03:00:00.469 --> 03:00:00.479 align:start position:0%
um and i'm just curious if if
 
03:00:02.389 --> 03:00:02.399 align:start position:0%
if you all shifted on that in the last
 
03:00:04.950 --> 03:00:04.960 align:start position:0%
few days or my memory's bad
 
03:00:07.910 --> 03:00:07.920 align:start position:0%
really haven't except we we've added to
 
03:00:10.710 --> 03:00:10.720 align:start position:0%
the process you know this this presumes
 
03:00:13.030 --> 03:00:13.040 align:start position:0%
i i would think uh
 
03:00:15.269 --> 03:00:15.279 align:start position:0%
a a claimant who is not represented by
 
03:00:16.710 --> 03:00:16.720 align:start position:0%
council you know you could certainly
 
03:00:16.720 --> 03:00:17.990 align:start position:0%
council you know you could certainly
expect

03:00:17.990 --> 03:00:18.000 align:start position:0%
expect
 
03:00:19.990 --> 03:00:20.000 align:start position:0%
that council
 
03:00:22.070 --> 03:00:22.080 align:start position:0%
if they were involved in the discussion
 
03:00:24.070 --> 03:00:24.080 align:start position:0%
would make sure that there was a proper
 
03:00:26.469 --> 03:00:26.479 align:start position:0%
response to the settlement claims
 
03:00:28.950 --> 03:00:28.960 align:start position:0%
offered this is for claimants who don't
 
03:00:30.790 --> 03:00:30.800 align:start position:0%
retain counsel
 
03:00:32.469 --> 03:00:32.479 align:start position:0%
and you know to the extent there's a
 
03:00:34.389 --> 03:00:34.399 align:start position:0%
notice that says
 
03:00:36.790 --> 03:00:36.800 align:start position:0%
this is the final offer
 
03:00:39.590 --> 03:00:39.600 align:start position:0%
you know we do think it's it's
 
03:00:41.750 --> 03:00:41.760 align:start position:0%
not necessary in the context
 
03:00:42.790 --> 03:00:42.800 align:start position:0%
of a
 
03:00:44.790 --> 03:00:44.800 align:start position:0%
of someone who's represented but to the
 
03:00:47.190 --> 03:00:47.200 align:start position:0%
extent they're not represented we see no
 
03:00:50.790 --> 03:00:50.800 align:start position:0%
harm in requiring notice uh at the time
 
03:00:52.550 --> 03:00:52.560 align:start position:0%
when the ag's
 
03:00:54.230 --> 03:00:54.240 align:start position:0%
given the final
 
03:00:56.150 --> 03:00:56.160 align:start position:0%
determination of what they're willing to
 
03:00:59.190 --> 03:00:59.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:01.030 --> 03:01:01.040 align:start position:0%
okay i'll i'll ask it this way i'm
 
03:01:02.950 --> 03:01:02.960 align:start position:0%
because i'm having trouble uh reading
 
03:01:05.510 --> 03:01:05.520 align:start position:0%
the whole paragraph and contextualizing
 
03:01:07.269 --> 03:01:07.279 align:start position:0%
what you're saying with the words that
 
03:01:09.750 --> 03:01:09.760 align:start position:0%
are on the document so i'm i'm i'm going
 
03:01:11.990 --> 03:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
to ask you if you think the writing is
 
03:01:14.550 --> 03:01:14.560 align:start position:0%
currently already clear that you've
 
03:01:14.560 --> 03:01:15.990 align:start position:0%
currently already clear that you've
redlined

03:01:15.990 --> 03:01:16.000 align:start position:0%
redlined
 
03:01:17.590 --> 03:01:17.600 align:start position:0%
to to make
 
03:01:20.870 --> 03:01:20.880 align:start position:0%
make this part of the
 
03:01:22.070 --> 03:01:22.080 align:start position:0%
the law
 
03:01:22.080 --> 03:01:23.110 align:start position:0%
the law
when

03:01:23.110 --> 03:01:23.120 align:start position:0%
when
 
03:01:26.230 --> 03:01:26.240 align:start position:0%
the victim does not have counsel
 
03:01:28.870 --> 03:01:28.880 align:start position:0%
and only then is that your is that
 
03:01:30.870 --> 03:01:30.880 align:start position:0%
correct that you you you don't
 
03:01:33.269 --> 03:01:33.279 align:start position:0%
necessarily want this in writing
 
03:01:35.990 --> 03:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
for those that have no counsel
 
03:01:39.510 --> 03:01:39.520 align:start position:0%
so this revision assumes that the
 
03:01:41.110 --> 03:01:41.120 align:start position:0%
provision later on that says the
 
03:01:42.469 --> 03:01:42.479 align:start position:0%
administrator will provide this
 
03:01:42.479 --> 03:01:43.750 align:start position:0%
administrator will provide this
information

03:01:43.750 --> 03:01:43.760 align:start position:0%
information
 
03:01:45.670 --> 03:01:45.680 align:start position:0%
at the time
 
03:01:45.680 --> 03:01:47.030 align:start position:0%
at the time
before

03:01:47.030 --> 03:01:47.040 align:start position:0%
before
 
03:01:47.040 --> 03:01:49.349 align:start position:0%
before
um

03:01:49.349 --> 03:01:49.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:01:52.309 --> 03:01:52.319 align:start position:0%
then what i'm saying here is that this
 
03:01:54.790 --> 03:01:54.800 align:start position:0%
idea should this notice should be given
 
03:01:54.800 --> 03:01:55.830 align:start position:0%
idea should this notice should be given
to

03:01:55.830 --> 03:01:55.840 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:01:58.150 --> 03:01:58.160 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
03:01:59.750 --> 03:01:59.760 align:start position:0%
to the
 
03:02:02.389 --> 03:02:02.399 align:start position:0%
claimant at the time the ag provides
 
03:02:04.150 --> 03:02:04.160 align:start position:0%
their information so if if the
 
03:02:05.990 --> 03:02:06.000 align:start position:0%
legislature believes this notice is
 
03:02:08.469 --> 03:02:08.479 align:start position:0%
important i think it should be
 
03:02:10.630 --> 03:02:10.640 align:start position:0%
provided before
 
03:02:13.030 --> 03:02:13.040 align:start position:0%
a claimant in effect you know does
 
03:02:15.110 --> 03:02:15.120 align:start position:0%
nothing and waives their rights to
 
03:02:15.120 --> 03:02:16.389 align:start position:0%
nothing and waives their rights to
further

03:02:16.389 --> 03:02:16.399 align:start position:0%
further
 
03:02:19.269 --> 03:02:19.279 align:start position:0%
pursue this claim either by withdrawing
 
03:02:21.510 --> 03:02:21.520 align:start position:0%
it or
 
03:02:21.520 --> 03:02:22.469 align:start position:0%
it or
or

03:02:22.469 --> 03:02:22.479 align:start position:0%
or
 
03:02:24.309 --> 03:02:24.319 align:start position:0%
asking the administrator to decide the
 
03:02:24.319 --> 03:02:27.190 align:start position:0%
asking the administrator to decide the
claim

03:02:27.190 --> 03:02:27.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:27.200 --> 03:02:29.349 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:02:29.349 --> 03:02:29.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:02:31.990 --> 03:02:32.000 align:start position:0%
representative weiler
 
03:02:33.590 --> 03:02:33.600 align:start position:0%
you don't spell it out but you mentioned
 
03:02:36.309 --> 03:02:36.319 align:start position:0%
that it's for those that have no counsel
 
03:02:38.469 --> 03:02:38.479 align:start position:0%
that's right
 
03:02:42.230 --> 03:02:42.240 align:start position:0%
perhaps that language should be included
 
03:02:45.510 --> 03:02:45.520 align:start position:0%
so so um mr a.g
 
03:02:47.349 --> 03:02:47.359 align:start position:0%
this does this does
 
03:02:50.230 --> 03:02:50.240 align:start position:0%
does this red line from four to
 
03:02:53.590 --> 03:02:53.600 align:start position:0%
six on page seven represent a material
 
03:02:56.150 --> 03:02:56.160 align:start position:0%
difference in what you view how you
 
03:02:57.990 --> 03:02:58.000 align:start position:0%
viewed the process or what you think is
 
03:02:58.000 --> 03:03:02.070 align:start position:0%
viewed the process or what you think is
acceptable

03:03:02.070 --> 03:03:02.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:03.590 --> 03:03:03.600 align:start position:0%
if you if you don't have an answer on
 
03:03:05.910 --> 03:03:05.920 align:start position:0%
the spot please just say so
 
03:03:07.510 --> 03:03:07.520 align:start position:0%
yeah so
 
03:03:09.830 --> 03:03:09.840 align:start position:0%
i mean so right before this paragraph at
 
03:03:13.830 --> 03:03:13.840 align:start position:0%
the bottom of page six or i'm if i'm
 
03:03:15.510 --> 03:03:15.520 align:start position:0%
looking at the same version you all are
 
03:03:17.910 --> 03:03:17.920 align:start position:0%
but at right before paragraph h
 
03:03:19.349 --> 03:03:19.359 align:start position:0%
so it's g
 
03:03:20.630 --> 03:03:20.640 align:start position:0%
i mean it
 
03:03:22.389 --> 03:03:22.399 align:start position:0%
the current draft does say within 30
 
03:03:23.990 --> 03:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
days of receiving the investigation
 
03:03:27.030 --> 03:03:27.040 align:start position:0%
report the ag must designate or indicate
 
03:03:28.790 --> 03:03:28.800 align:start position:0%
to the claimant and the administrator
 
03:03:30.710 --> 03:03:30.720 align:start position:0%
its updated position
 
03:03:33.110 --> 03:03:33.120 align:start position:0%
regarding the claim
 
03:03:34.630 --> 03:03:34.640 align:start position:0%
and the administrator will advise the
 
03:03:36.630 --> 03:03:36.640 align:start position:0%
claimant regarding their options at that
 
03:03:36.640 --> 03:03:38.830 align:start position:0%
claimant regarding their options at that
point

03:03:38.830 --> 03:03:38.840 align:start position:0%
point
 
03:03:43.830 --> 03:03:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:45.990 --> 03:03:46.000 align:start position:0%
so does that imply that this additional
 
03:03:48.070 --> 03:03:48.080 align:start position:0%
language is redundant
 
03:03:48.080 --> 03:03:48.790 align:start position:0%
language is redundant
it's

03:03:48.790 --> 03:03:48.800 align:start position:0%
it's
 
03:03:51.110 --> 03:03:51.120 align:start position:0%
redundant i i think
 
03:03:52.710 --> 03:03:52.720 align:start position:0%
i understand the concept i think the
 
03:03:54.790 --> 03:03:54.800 align:start position:0%
concept makes sense the one concern i
 
03:03:57.190 --> 03:03:57.200 align:start position:0%
have with putting it here not to get too
 
03:03:58.870 --> 03:03:58.880 align:start position:0%
nitpicky is that
 
03:04:01.110 --> 03:04:01.120 align:start position:0%
this confuses it a little bit i mean
 
03:04:03.110 --> 03:04:03.120 align:start position:0%
we're putting a deadline i think on the
 
03:04:06.830 --> 03:04:06.840 align:start position:0%
claimant to elect an option
 
03:04:09.349 --> 03:04:09.359 align:start position:0%
so think they've already been provided
 
03:04:10.790 --> 03:04:10.800 align:start position:0%
this notice i don't know how many times
 
03:04:14.469 --> 03:04:14.479 align:start position:0%
i need to be provided the notice but
 
03:04:16.389 --> 03:04:16.399 align:start position:0%
so it strikes me as unnecessary but i
 
03:04:17.910 --> 03:04:17.920 align:start position:0%
also don't feel that strongly about it
 
03:04:19.110 --> 03:04:19.120 align:start position:0%
that that's
 
03:04:21.429 --> 03:04:21.439 align:start position:0%
i think it would be fine
 
03:04:23.349 --> 03:04:23.359 align:start position:0%
if but there may be a better way to do
 
03:04:24.630 --> 03:04:24.640 align:start position:0%
it that i just can't come up with off
 
03:04:27.670 --> 03:04:27.680 align:start position:0%
the top if it's if it's redundant and
 
03:04:29.670 --> 03:04:29.680 align:start position:0%
possibly conflicts
 
03:04:31.190 --> 03:04:31.200 align:start position:0%
or confuses
 
03:04:33.830 --> 03:04:33.840 align:start position:0%
then we shouldn't do it it's my view
 
03:04:34.790 --> 03:04:34.800 align:start position:0%
yeah i
 
03:04:37.590 --> 03:04:37.600 align:start position:0%
i would suggest that maybe we work on
 
03:04:39.429 --> 03:04:39.439 align:start position:0%
some language to try to accomplish this
 
03:04:41.269 --> 03:04:41.279 align:start position:0%
without having it result in any
 
03:04:43.910 --> 03:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
confusion sort of further down the
 
03:04:43.920 --> 03:04:44.710 align:start position:0%
confusion sort of further down the
the

03:04:44.710 --> 03:04:44.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:04:46.469 --> 03:04:46.479 align:start position:0%
path during the process because what i
 
03:04:48.389 --> 03:04:48.399 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want to have happen is
 
03:04:50.309 --> 03:04:50.319 align:start position:0%
i think it makes sense that there needs
 
03:04:53.910 --> 03:04:53.920 align:start position:0%
to be a deadline by which the
 
03:04:55.670 --> 03:04:55.680 align:start position:0%
the claimant needs to indicate whether
 
03:04:57.750 --> 03:04:57.760 align:start position:0%
they're agreeing with the aeg designee's
 
03:04:59.510 --> 03:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
position or not
 
03:05:01.990 --> 03:05:02.000 align:start position:0%
and if that deadline passes
 
03:05:03.750 --> 03:05:03.760 align:start position:0%
i just want to avoid a situation which
 
03:05:05.269 --> 03:05:05.279 align:start position:0%
there's then an argument about whether
 
03:05:07.510 --> 03:05:07.520 align:start position:0%
they were ever provided notice of their
 
03:05:09.590 --> 03:05:09.600 align:start position:0%
options or whether they were provided
 
03:05:11.349 --> 03:05:11.359 align:start position:0%
notice of their options every single
 
03:05:13.030 --> 03:05:13.040 align:start position:0%
time they had to be provided notice of
 
03:05:14.309 --> 03:05:14.319 align:start position:0%
their options
 
03:05:16.230 --> 03:05:16.240 align:start position:0%
and and result in the hang up so i i
 
03:05:19.030 --> 03:05:19.040 align:start position:0%
think we can probably accomplish this
 
03:05:21.910 --> 03:05:21.920 align:start position:0%
by tweaking this language slightly
 
03:05:24.389 --> 03:05:24.399 align:start position:0%
okay so that that tweak will appear in
 
03:05:27.349 --> 03:05:27.359 align:start position:0%
the working groups edits and we'll be
 
03:05:31.030 --> 03:05:31.040 align:start position:0%
voting on it on thursday and if we can
 
03:05:33.110 --> 03:05:33.120 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll try to get it to the
 
03:05:35.190 --> 03:05:35.200 align:start position:0%
plaintiff's council as early as possible
 
03:05:37.269 --> 03:05:37.279 align:start position:0%
if you slip them
 
03:05:39.830 --> 03:05:39.840 align:start position:0%
a draft before ols
 
03:05:42.230 --> 03:05:42.240 align:start position:0%
finishes it i i wouldn't have a problem
 
03:05:46.870 --> 03:05:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:48.230 --> 03:05:48.240 align:start position:0%
do you have any
 
03:05:50.070 --> 03:05:50.080 align:start position:0%
other comments on that
 
03:05:52.230 --> 03:05:52.240 align:start position:0%
i don't and i and i think
 
03:05:53.830 --> 03:05:53.840 align:start position:0%
i'm sure we can figure out some language
 
03:05:54.950 --> 03:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
that works
 
03:05:57.830 --> 03:05:57.840 align:start position:0%
all right good um so i think we're on
 
03:05:59.510 --> 03:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
your item 10.
 
03:06:01.750 --> 03:06:01.760 align:start position:0%
item 10
 
03:06:04.630 --> 03:06:04.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:08.309 --> 03:06:08.319 align:start position:0%
and and so this concerns
 
03:06:09.590 --> 03:06:09.600 align:start position:0%
and this is at
 
03:06:13.269 --> 03:06:13.279 align:start position:0%
page 8 of our red line line 6 to 12
 
03:06:15.990 --> 03:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
and this concerns having some judicial
 
03:06:19.990 --> 03:06:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:21.670 --> 03:06:21.680 align:start position:0%
so uh you know
 
03:06:24.230 --> 03:06:24.240 align:start position:0%
we agree with the attorney general's
 
03:06:26.070 --> 03:06:26.080 align:start position:0%
finality concerns
 
03:06:28.790 --> 03:06:28.800 align:start position:0%
and and therefore in our markup we we
 
03:06:30.150 --> 03:06:30.160 align:start position:0%
agree that there
 
03:06:32.550 --> 03:06:32.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't need to be a pellet review
 
03:06:35.190 --> 03:06:35.200 align:start position:0%
that said we we do believe there's there
 
03:06:35.200 --> 03:06:36.150 align:start position:0%
that said we we do believe there's there
is

03:06:36.150 --> 03:06:36.160 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:06:39.110 --> 03:06:39.120 align:start position:0%
a place for some limited judicial review
 
03:06:41.910 --> 03:06:41.920 align:start position:0%
of this process this uh
 
03:06:44.630 --> 03:06:44.640 align:start position:0%
alternative dispute resolution process
 
03:06:47.030 --> 03:06:47.040 align:start position:0%
and um and and and we do believe that
 
03:06:48.790 --> 03:06:48.800 align:start position:0%
our claimant should have should be
 
03:06:50.469 --> 03:06:50.479 align:start position:0%
entitled to get a judgment a court
 
03:06:50.479 --> 03:06:51.429 align:start position:0%
entitled to get a judgment a court
judgment

03:06:51.429 --> 03:06:51.439 align:start position:0%
judgment
 
03:06:53.190 --> 03:06:53.200 align:start position:0%
uh at the end of this process if they
 
03:06:55.110 --> 03:06:55.120 align:start position:0%
believe that they need one
 
03:06:57.110 --> 03:06:57.120 align:start position:0%
so um
 
03:06:59.990 --> 03:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
we've cited to uh the
 
03:07:00.000 --> 03:07:00.710 align:start position:0%
we've cited to uh the
uh

03:07:00.710 --> 03:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:07:04.389 --> 03:07:04.399 align:start position:0%
rsa 542-8 which is the part of the
 
03:07:06.469 --> 03:07:06.479 align:start position:0%
arbitration statute and
 
03:07:06.479 --> 03:07:07.429 align:start position:0%
arbitration statute and
um

03:07:07.429 --> 03:07:07.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:07:09.349 --> 03:07:09.359 align:start position:0%
and achieving a
 
03:07:12.389 --> 03:07:12.399 align:start position:0%
a confirmation and a judgment uh in a
 
03:07:15.670 --> 03:07:15.680 align:start position:0%
court following an arbitration um
 
03:07:17.429 --> 03:07:17.439 align:start position:0%
and i you know i believe the the
 
03:07:19.030 --> 03:07:19.040 align:start position:0%
attorney general's version had had
 
03:07:20.950 --> 03:07:20.960 align:start position:0%
previously referred to it as well
 
03:07:23.429 --> 03:07:23.439 align:start position:0%
although um you know striking out this
 
03:07:25.590 --> 03:07:25.600 align:start position:0%
uh this review provision and also the
 
03:07:25.600 --> 03:07:26.469 align:start position:0%
uh this review provision and also the
appeal

03:07:26.469 --> 03:07:26.479 align:start position:0%
appeal
 
03:07:30.309 --> 03:07:30.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:32.150 --> 03:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
i think it's actually helpful if i just
 
03:07:34.469 --> 03:07:34.479 align:start position:0%
read to you you know the what we're what
 
03:07:36.150 --> 03:07:36.160 align:start position:0%
we're what we're asking the court to do
 
03:07:38.469 --> 03:07:38.479 align:start position:0%
here which i think is is pretty narrow
 
03:07:40.550 --> 03:07:40.560 align:start position:0%
uh and especially we've narrowed it
 
03:07:43.030 --> 03:07:43.040 align:start position:0%
further in in our red line here
 
03:07:44.309 --> 03:07:44.319 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
03:07:46.550 --> 03:07:46.560 align:start position:0%
in an arbitration proceeding or in in
 
03:07:49.110 --> 03:07:49.120 align:start position:0%
this proceeding the court will only
 
03:07:51.670 --> 03:07:51.680 align:start position:0%
correct or modify the award for plain
 
03:07:51.680 --> 03:07:53.429 align:start position:0%
correct or modify the award for plain
mistake

03:07:53.429 --> 03:07:53.439 align:start position:0%
mistake
 
03:07:55.910 --> 03:07:55.920 align:start position:0%
or will vacate an award for fraud
 
03:07:58.469 --> 03:07:58.479 align:start position:0%
corruption or misconduct by the parties
 
03:08:00.790 --> 03:08:00.800 align:start position:0%
or by the arbitrators or on the ground
 
03:08:02.950 --> 03:08:02.960 align:start position:0%
that the arbitrators have exceeded their
 
03:08:02.960 --> 03:08:08.070 align:start position:0%
that the arbitrators have exceeded their
powers

03:08:08.070 --> 03:08:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:11.590 --> 03:08:11.600 align:start position:0%
now as i said we've uh the the one um
 
03:08:13.910 --> 03:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
the one ground listed there uh plain
 
03:08:16.309 --> 03:08:16.319 align:start position:0%
mistake is is the one that could be
 
03:08:18.870 --> 03:08:18.880 align:start position:0%
read broadly and some courts have so
 
03:08:20.950 --> 03:08:20.960 align:start position:0%
we've restricted it in our revision here
 
03:08:23.750 --> 03:08:23.760 align:start position:0%
to only mathematical errors
 
03:08:25.670 --> 03:08:25.680 align:start position:0%
in other words we're not asking a court
 
03:08:27.510 --> 03:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
to second guess what the administrator
 
03:08:28.790 --> 03:08:28.800 align:start position:0%
has done
 
03:08:31.030 --> 03:08:31.040 align:start position:0%
we're just asking the court to ferret
 
03:08:34.469 --> 03:08:34.479 align:start position:0%
out corruption fraud misconduct or
 
03:08:36.550 --> 03:08:36.560 align:start position:0%
obvious mathematical errors
 
03:08:38.870 --> 03:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
and we think that form of limited review
 
03:08:41.670 --> 03:08:41.680 align:start position:0%
is is justified and appropriate
 
03:08:44.150 --> 03:08:44.160 align:start position:0%
and and if a claimant wants to go and
 
03:08:45.910 --> 03:08:45.920 align:start position:0%
get a judgment once they get a court to
 
03:08:47.990 --> 03:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
review and get a judgment they should be
 
03:08:50.150 --> 03:08:50.160 align:start position:0%
able to do that just as they would in an
 
03:08:54.469 --> 03:08:54.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:56.710 --> 03:08:56.720 align:start position:0%
so you're you're um
 
03:08:58.469 --> 03:08:58.479 align:start position:0%
you're making reference to corruption
 
03:09:00.950 --> 03:09:00.960 align:start position:0%
and fraud and i don't i don't see those
 
03:09:04.070 --> 03:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
words on the document so are those
 
03:09:06.710 --> 03:09:06.720 align:start position:0%
embedded in the rsa you've referenced
 
03:09:10.950 --> 03:09:10.960 align:start position:0%
yeah the rsa i just read to you 5428
 
03:09:13.190 --> 03:09:13.200 align:start position:0%
provides the the narrow grounds that a
 
03:09:15.750 --> 03:09:15.760 align:start position:0%
court will review an arbitrator's award
 
03:09:17.510 --> 03:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
and and those narrow grounds we have
 
03:09:23.349 --> 03:09:23.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:25.269 --> 03:09:25.279 align:start position:0%
all right mr mr attorney general do you
 
03:09:28.229 --> 03:09:28.239 align:start position:0%
have a comment for us
 
03:09:31.429 --> 03:09:31.439 align:start position:0%
yeah i mean i again i i understand that
 
03:09:33.590 --> 03:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
the intent of this i would have a
 
03:09:36.309 --> 03:09:36.319 align:start position:0%
concern with it i
 
03:09:38.630 --> 03:09:38.640 align:start position:0%
i'm not as concerned with the the
 
03:09:40.790 --> 03:09:40.800 align:start position:0%
mistake piece and i think that could be
 
03:09:42.550 --> 03:09:42.560 align:start position:0%
achieved perhaps by giving the
 
03:09:43.830 --> 03:09:43.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity to petition the
 
03:09:46.630 --> 03:09:46.640 align:start position:0%
administrator to do a take a second look
 
03:09:47.990 --> 03:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
if there's a thought that there might be
 
03:09:49.830 --> 03:09:49.840 align:start position:0%
a mistake but
 
03:09:51.510 --> 03:09:51.520 align:start position:0%
the the statute is just it's a little
 
03:09:53.750 --> 03:09:53.760 align:start position:0%
bit broader than that it gets into fraud
 
03:09:55.590 --> 03:09:55.600 align:start position:0%
corruption misconduct but also on the
 
03:09:57.510 --> 03:09:57.520 align:start position:0%
ground that an arbitrator has exceeded
 
03:10:00.710 --> 03:10:00.720 align:start position:0%
their powers i just think that opens
 
03:10:02.790 --> 03:10:02.800 align:start position:0%
opens up a number of potential arguments
 
03:10:02.800 --> 03:10:04.710 align:start position:0%
opens up a number of potential arguments
here

03:10:04.710 --> 03:10:04.720 align:start position:0%
here
 
03:10:06.710 --> 03:10:06.720 align:start position:0%
and and really would give potentially
 
03:10:08.070 --> 03:10:08.080 align:start position:0%
the ability to argue to the court that
 
03:10:10.309 --> 03:10:10.319 align:start position:0%
the administrator has not
 
03:10:12.950 --> 03:10:12.960 align:start position:0%
applied the guidelines correctly and
 
03:10:15.429 --> 03:10:15.439 align:start position:0%
thus has exceeded their powers
 
03:10:17.910 --> 03:10:17.920 align:start position:0%
and thus it i think potentially provides
 
03:10:19.670 --> 03:10:19.680 align:start position:0%
just another
 
03:10:19.680 --> 03:10:20.710 align:start position:0%
just another
another

03:10:20.710 --> 03:10:20.720 align:start position:0%
another
 
03:10:22.870 --> 03:10:22.880 align:start position:0%
level of review for this in court which
 
03:10:24.070 --> 03:10:24.080 align:start position:0%
i think
 
03:10:26.550 --> 03:10:26.560 align:start position:0%
the whole purpose of this is to avoid
 
03:10:26.560 --> 03:10:27.510 align:start position:0%
the whole purpose of this is to avoid
and

03:10:27.510 --> 03:10:27.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:10:29.830 --> 03:10:29.840 align:start position:0%
even if you file something in court just
 
03:10:29.840 --> 03:10:30.870 align:start position:0%
even if you file something in court just
to

03:10:30.870 --> 03:10:30.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:10:32.630 --> 03:10:32.640 align:start position:0%
just to try to correct a mistake that
 
03:10:34.790 --> 03:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
requires you know the attorney general
 
03:10:36.469 --> 03:10:36.479 align:start position:0%
to look at it and potentially file
 
03:10:38.070 --> 03:10:38.080 align:start position:0%
something in response
 
03:10:40.710 --> 03:10:40.720 align:start position:0%
i i i think it's i think it's
 
03:10:43.349 --> 03:10:43.359 align:start position:0%
unnecessary i think it it kind of goes
 
03:10:45.269 --> 03:10:45.279 align:start position:0%
against the purpose of this process i
 
03:10:47.670 --> 03:10:47.680 align:start position:0%
understand the intent behind it but i
 
03:10:49.670 --> 03:10:49.680 align:start position:0%
think if there's a concern for
 
03:10:51.830 --> 03:10:51.840 align:start position:0%
just plain mistakes or mathematical
 
03:10:54.469 --> 03:10:54.479 align:start position:0%
errors i think that's better achieved by
 
03:10:55.990 --> 03:10:56.000 align:start position:0%
giving an opportunity to petition the
 
03:10:57.910 --> 03:10:57.920 align:start position:0%
administrator to take a second look than
 
03:10:57.920 --> 03:10:58.790 align:start position:0%
administrator to take a second look than
to

03:10:58.790 --> 03:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:11:01.030 --> 03:11:01.040 align:start position:0%
then to open this up to
 
03:11:04.550 --> 03:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
to court which is what we tried to avoid
 
03:11:06.630 --> 03:11:06.640 align:start position:0%
may i address yes
 
03:11:08.870 --> 03:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
03:11:11.269 --> 03:11:11.279 align:start position:0%
as far as exceeding powers i you know i
 
03:11:13.269 --> 03:11:13.279 align:start position:0%
think we could probably concede on that
 
03:11:15.670 --> 03:11:15.680 align:start position:0%
and make a further revision uh if that
 
03:11:17.269 --> 03:11:17.279 align:start position:0%
was a deal breaker
 
03:11:17.279 --> 03:11:18.630 align:start position:0%
was a deal breaker
um

03:11:18.630 --> 03:11:18.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:11:21.110 --> 03:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
and and i just want to also highlight
 
03:11:23.110 --> 03:11:23.120 align:start position:0%
you know and i think david visananzo has
 
03:11:25.190 --> 03:11:25.200 align:start position:0%
had said this repeatedly that we're
 
03:11:27.910 --> 03:11:27.920 align:start position:0%
dealing with trust with these plaintiffs
 
03:11:30.790 --> 03:11:30.800 align:start position:0%
uh and and i think having this
 
03:11:33.269 --> 03:11:33.279 align:start position:0%
this limited very narrow form of
 
03:11:34.630 --> 03:11:34.640 align:start position:0%
judicial review at the end of the
 
03:11:34.640 --> 03:11:36.150 align:start position:0%
judicial review at the end of the
process

03:11:36.150 --> 03:11:36.160 align:start position:0%
process
 
03:11:38.389 --> 03:11:38.399 align:start position:0%
to make sure it's on the up and up and
 
03:11:40.550 --> 03:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
everything's been done right and and if
 
03:11:42.870 --> 03:11:42.880 align:start position:0%
they think it's necessary they can get a
 
03:11:44.870 --> 03:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
court order and a judgment at the end of
 
03:11:46.309 --> 03:11:46.319 align:start position:0%
this process i you know i think they
 
03:11:48.790 --> 03:11:48.800 align:start position:0%
should be entitled to do that
 
03:11:50.950 --> 03:11:50.960 align:start position:0%
so representative weiler had his hand up
 
03:11:54.790 --> 03:11:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:57.030 --> 03:11:57.040 align:start position:0%
so this is a unique process we're hoping
 
03:11:59.269 --> 03:11:59.279 align:start position:0%
it works if it doesn't we change it but
 
03:12:01.349 --> 03:12:01.359 align:start position:0%
in the meantime the whole purpose was to
 
03:12:03.269 --> 03:12:03.279 align:start position:0%
avoid court
 
03:12:05.349 --> 03:12:05.359 align:start position:0%
to avoid costs in courts if hundreds of
 
03:12:07.830 --> 03:12:07.840 align:start position:0%
cases go to the court for review they're
 
03:12:09.190 --> 03:12:09.200 align:start position:0%
going to come back to us and say you
 
03:12:11.349 --> 03:12:11.359 align:start position:0%
didn't give us enough money because it's
 
03:12:13.670 --> 03:12:13.680 align:start position:0%
taken a lot of judiciary time
 
03:12:16.309 --> 03:12:16.319 align:start position:0%
to review these hundreds of cases so
 
03:12:18.229 --> 03:12:18.239 align:start position:0%
this is a unique process i'd rather let
 
03:12:21.349 --> 03:12:21.359 align:start position:0%
it see how it runs if it's successful if
 
03:12:23.510 --> 03:12:23.520 align:start position:0%
we seem to settle most of this stuff
 
03:12:25.750 --> 03:12:25.760 align:start position:0%
without in a short period of time and
 
03:12:27.510 --> 03:12:27.520 align:start position:0%
don't have to drag most of them into
 
03:12:29.670 --> 03:12:29.680 align:start position:0%
court then we've been successful i don't
 
03:12:31.990 --> 03:12:32.000 align:start position:0%
want to drag this into court so that's
 
03:12:34.229 --> 03:12:34.239 align:start position:0%
that's i am opposed
 
03:12:36.229 --> 03:12:36.239 align:start position:0%
represent umber
 
03:12:38.229 --> 03:12:38.239 align:start position:0%
uh yes um
 
03:12:40.870 --> 03:12:40.880 align:start position:0%
i don't think we can forget that the
 
03:12:40.880 --> 03:12:42.389 align:start position:0%
i don't think we can forget that the
administrator

03:12:42.389 --> 03:12:42.399 align:start position:0%
administrator
 
03:12:42.399 --> 03:12:43.750 align:start position:0%
administrator
is

03:12:43.750 --> 03:12:43.760 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:12:45.750 --> 03:12:45.760 align:start position:0%
appointed by
 
03:12:47.990 --> 03:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
the um
 
03:12:49.670 --> 03:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
supreme court
 
03:12:50.950 --> 03:12:50.960 align:start position:0%
and so
 
03:12:53.269 --> 03:12:53.279 align:start position:0%
he's already
 
03:12:56.229 --> 03:12:56.239 align:start position:0%
the highest court official
 
03:12:57.590 --> 03:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
and so
 
03:12:59.670 --> 03:12:59.680 align:start position:0%
my you know so
 
03:13:02.309 --> 03:13:02.319 align:start position:0%
we're going to have someone down at a
 
03:13:03.830 --> 03:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
lower court level
 
03:13:07.670 --> 03:13:07.680 align:start position:0%
review a decision that is made by
 
03:13:07.680 --> 03:13:09.590 align:start position:0%
review a decision that is made by
somebody

03:13:09.590 --> 03:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
somebody
 
03:13:13.510 --> 03:13:13.520 align:start position:0%
in the supreme court area so i just
 
03:13:17.269 --> 03:13:17.279 align:start position:0%
i just think that uh it's um
 
03:13:18.790 --> 03:13:18.800 align:start position:0%
it's totally
 
03:13:21.429 --> 03:13:21.439 align:start position:0%
unnecessary and i do agree with the
 
03:13:23.750 --> 03:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
attorney general if we want to add
 
03:13:25.990 --> 03:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
something in there that says
 
03:13:29.110 --> 03:13:29.120 align:start position:0%
you know nobody's perfect and uh and the
 
03:13:31.670 --> 03:13:31.680 align:start position:0%
administrator might make a mistake
 
03:13:31.680 --> 03:13:32.550 align:start position:0%
administrator might make a mistake
on

03:13:32.550 --> 03:13:32.560 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:13:34.710 --> 03:13:34.720 align:start position:0%
you know math or whatever
 
03:13:34.720 --> 03:13:35.590 align:start position:0%
you know math or whatever
then

03:13:35.590 --> 03:13:35.600 align:start position:0%
then
 
03:13:37.830 --> 03:13:37.840 align:start position:0%
you know i have i have no problem with
 
03:13:39.269 --> 03:13:39.279 align:start position:0%
that but
 
03:13:41.349 --> 03:13:41.359 align:start position:0%
i think we all know
 
03:13:44.309 --> 03:13:44.319 align:start position:0%
that the guidelines the
 
03:13:47.429 --> 03:13:47.439 align:start position:0%
monetary awards are all going to be
 
03:13:50.550 --> 03:13:50.560 align:start position:0%
out there for everybody to look at
 
03:13:53.750 --> 03:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
and so you know somebody could
 
03:13:53.760 --> 03:13:55.750 align:start position:0%
and so you know somebody could
just

03:13:55.750 --> 03:13:55.760 align:start position:0%
just
 
03:14:00.870 --> 03:14:00.880 align:start position:0%
administrator said abc and equate it to
 
03:14:02.870 --> 03:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
a million two
 
03:14:04.870 --> 03:14:04.880 align:start position:0%
and if someone goes back and adds it up
 
03:14:07.429 --> 03:14:07.439 align:start position:0%
and it actually is a million four then i
 
03:14:09.349 --> 03:14:09.359 align:start position:0%
think the administrator could change
 
03:14:11.590 --> 03:14:11.600 align:start position:0%
that without
 
03:14:13.990 --> 03:14:14.000 align:start position:0%
getting some kind of judgment from
 
03:14:16.950 --> 03:14:16.960 align:start position:0%
i assume the superior court
 
03:14:18.710 --> 03:14:18.720 align:start position:0%
i would hate for that to have to go back
 
03:14:22.830 --> 03:14:22.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:26.469 --> 03:14:26.479 align:start position:0%
um all right so i i i think we should
 
03:14:29.510 --> 03:14:29.520 align:start position:0%
probably straw vote this um
 
03:14:32.229 --> 03:14:32.239 align:start position:0%
the way the way i'd like to tee this up
 
03:14:33.990 --> 03:14:34.000 align:start position:0%
is i'd like to
 
03:14:36.309 --> 03:14:36.319 align:start position:0%
have the attorney general in the in the
 
03:14:39.190 --> 03:14:39.200 align:start position:0%
working group uh take another look at
 
03:14:41.910 --> 03:14:41.920 align:start position:0%
this idea that there's some sort of an
 
03:14:44.630 --> 03:14:44.640 align:start position:0%
appeal process in here to where
 
03:14:47.990 --> 03:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
the administrator could be flagged to to
 
03:14:50.070 --> 03:14:50.080 align:start position:0%
take a second look at what they did just
 
03:14:52.070 --> 03:14:52.080 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we're not making
 
03:14:54.150 --> 03:14:54.160 align:start position:0%
mistakes that just get through the
 
03:14:54.160 --> 03:14:57.750 align:start position:0%
mistakes that just get through the
system

03:14:57.750 --> 03:14:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:01.750 --> 03:15:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:03.590 --> 03:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
i i don't really have an opinion on it
 
03:15:07.269 --> 03:15:07.279 align:start position:0%
but but for the straw vote i'd like to
 
03:15:11.030 --> 03:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
phrase it so that if you raise your hand
 
03:15:14.229 --> 03:15:14.239 align:start position:0%
you're in favor of the working group
 
03:15:17.269 --> 03:15:17.279 align:start position:0%
coming back to this particular section
 
03:15:18.870 --> 03:15:18.880 align:start position:0%
and looking for
 
03:15:21.510 --> 03:15:21.520 align:start position:0%
a way to make sure that there is an
 
03:15:23.190 --> 03:15:23.200 align:start position:0%
appeals process
 
03:15:25.030 --> 03:15:25.040 align:start position:0%
adequate for
 
03:15:26.870 --> 03:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
the mistake of the math mistakes that
 
03:15:28.070 --> 03:15:28.080 align:start position:0%
could be made
 
03:15:30.229 --> 03:15:30.239 align:start position:0%
so if you raise your hand yes
 
03:15:31.990 --> 03:15:32.000 align:start position:0%
then that's what they'll do if you raise
 
03:15:33.910 --> 03:15:33.920 align:start position:0%
your hand no we'll probably have a
 
03:15:35.670 --> 03:15:35.680 align:start position:0%
little more discussion
 
03:15:37.670 --> 03:15:37.680 align:start position:0%
so if you're in favor please raise your
 
03:15:37.680 --> 03:15:40.550 align:start position:0%
so if you're in favor please raise your
hand

03:15:40.550 --> 03:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:50.950 --> 03:15:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:52.790 --> 03:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
if you raise your hand then you agree
 
03:15:55.269 --> 03:15:55.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:55.279 --> 03:15:56.229 align:start position:0%
 
no

03:15:56.229 --> 03:15:56.239 align:start position:0%
no
 
03:15:58.309 --> 03:15:58.319 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry it's getting it's getting late
 
03:16:00.070 --> 03:16:00.080 align:start position:0%
no if you raise your hand what you're
 
03:16:02.630 --> 03:16:02.640 align:start position:0%
saying is you you want the attorney
 
03:16:04.469 --> 03:16:04.479 align:start position:0%
general and the working group to take a
 
03:16:05.750 --> 03:16:05.760 align:start position:0%
look at
 
03:16:08.550 --> 03:16:08.560 align:start position:0%
this section of the bill because the
 
03:16:10.870 --> 03:16:10.880 align:start position:0%
plaintiffs would like to have a judicial
 
03:16:10.880 --> 03:16:12.229 align:start position:0%
plaintiffs would like to have a judicial
review

03:16:12.229 --> 03:16:12.239 align:start position:0%
review
 
03:16:14.229 --> 03:16:14.239 align:start position:0%
basically an appeals process put in
 
03:16:14.239 --> 03:16:14.950 align:start position:0%
basically an appeals process put in
there

03:16:14.950 --> 03:16:14.960 align:start position:0%
there
 
03:16:16.950 --> 03:16:16.960 align:start position:0%
and what the what the attorney general
 
03:16:19.269 --> 03:16:19.279 align:start position:0%
has suggested is maybe there's a way to
 
03:16:21.670 --> 03:16:21.680 align:start position:0%
have the administrator
 
03:16:24.150 --> 03:16:24.160 align:start position:0%
come back and take a fresh look at the
 
03:16:28.469 --> 03:16:28.479 align:start position:0%
decision and the math and all to
 
03:16:31.670 --> 03:16:31.680 align:start position:0%
make a secondary confirmatory
 
03:16:31.680 --> 03:16:32.790 align:start position:0%
make a secondary confirmatory
decision

03:16:32.790 --> 03:16:32.800 align:start position:0%
decision
 
03:16:34.790 --> 03:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
and and that we don't see that language
 
03:16:36.150 --> 03:16:36.160 align:start position:0%
right now because he's going to work on
 
03:16:39.990 --> 03:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
it yes sir without it going to court
 
03:16:42.229 --> 03:16:42.239 align:start position:0%
yes my proposal what what what i'm
 
03:16:44.389 --> 03:16:44.399 align:start position:0%
asking in the straw vote if they should
 
03:16:46.150 --> 03:16:46.160 align:start position:0%
write this in a way in which we don't
 
03:16:48.710 --> 03:16:48.720 align:start position:0%
take it back to the judiciary because as
 
03:16:50.950 --> 03:16:50.960 align:start position:0%
representative ownberger pointed out
 
03:16:53.190 --> 03:16:53.200 align:start position:0%
this is essentially an agent of the
 
03:16:55.510 --> 03:16:55.520 align:start position:0%
supreme court this is this is
 
03:16:57.349 --> 03:16:57.359 align:start position:0%
should be a pretty
 
03:17:00.309 --> 03:17:00.319 align:start position:0%
capable competent individual so
 
03:17:03.349 --> 03:17:03.359 align:start position:0%
an appeal process to a lower court
 
03:17:05.190 --> 03:17:05.200 align:start position:0%
in some ways just doesn't seem to make
 
03:17:08.469 --> 03:17:08.479 align:start position:0%
sense yes sir so one more question so i
 
03:17:10.870 --> 03:17:10.880 align:start position:0%
assume the appeal process would be
 
03:17:14.229 --> 03:17:14.239 align:start position:0%
limited to a review of how it was done
 
03:17:17.750 --> 03:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
and and the mathematics of it right
 
03:17:19.349 --> 03:17:19.359 align:start position:0%
right there
 
03:17:24.150 --> 03:17:24.160 align:start position:0%
so i've not read uh 542 colonnade so so
 
03:17:27.349 --> 03:17:27.359 align:start position:0%
what based on what i've heard here today
 
03:17:30.790 --> 03:17:30.800 align:start position:0%
the other com elements that maybe should
 
03:17:33.429 --> 03:17:33.439 align:start position:0%
be considered are things like fraud and
 
03:17:33.439 --> 03:17:34.630 align:start position:0%
be considered are things like fraud and
corruption

03:17:34.630 --> 03:17:34.640 align:start position:0%
corruption
 
03:17:37.030 --> 03:17:37.040 align:start position:0%
but as i'm thinking about it it makes no
 
03:17:38.870 --> 03:17:38.880 align:start position:0%
sense if the administrator is the one
 
03:17:41.510 --> 03:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
that acted fraudulently or corruptly
 
03:17:43.190 --> 03:17:43.200 align:start position:0%
they can't really review themselves in
 
03:17:45.830 --> 03:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
those situations anyways i mean a math
 
03:17:49.110 --> 03:17:49.120 align:start position:0%
error anyone can make a math error
 
03:17:53.110 --> 03:17:53.120 align:start position:0%
so i i see that as being reviewable
 
03:17:55.670 --> 03:17:55.680 align:start position:0%
so so does that answer your question
 
03:17:58.389 --> 03:17:58.399 align:start position:0%
so this so this i guess i i don't have a
 
03:18:00.150 --> 03:18:00.160 align:start position:0%
problem with the way
 
03:18:01.910 --> 03:18:01.920 align:start position:0%
we wrote the thing
 
03:18:03.990 --> 03:18:04.000 align:start position:0%
with the with the amendment
 
03:18:05.830 --> 03:18:05.840 align:start position:0%
that we're working with not that the
 
03:18:07.990 --> 03:18:08.000 align:start position:0%
plaintiff's amendment
 
03:18:09.910 --> 03:18:09.920 align:start position:0%
but i'm uncertain how to vote in that
 
03:18:09.920 --> 03:18:11.670 align:start position:0%
but i'm uncertain how to vote in that
case

03:18:11.670 --> 03:18:11.680 align:start position:0%
case
 
03:18:13.830 --> 03:18:13.840 align:start position:0%
i unders i understand your concern i
 
03:18:16.870 --> 03:18:16.880 align:start position:0%
respect your vote um the the process i'm
 
03:18:19.830 --> 03:18:19.840 align:start position:0%
trying to follow here uh representative
 
03:18:19.840 --> 03:18:20.870 align:start position:0%
trying to follow here uh representative
uh

03:18:20.870 --> 03:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:18:20.880 --> 03:18:22.870 align:start position:0%
uh
is

03:18:22.870 --> 03:18:22.880 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:18:25.269 --> 03:18:25.279 align:start position:0%
is the plaintiffs it i think it's
 
03:18:27.670 --> 03:18:27.680 align:start position:0%
important to the entire process
 
03:18:27.680 --> 03:18:28.950 align:start position:0%
important to the entire process
that

03:18:28.950 --> 03:18:28.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:18:30.950 --> 03:18:30.960 align:start position:0%
the plaintiffs council
 
03:18:32.630 --> 03:18:32.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily agree with
 
03:18:34.950 --> 03:18:34.960 align:start position:0%
everything the legislature is doing but
 
03:18:36.389 --> 03:18:36.399 align:start position:0%
that we've been fair
 
03:18:38.870 --> 03:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
and they've been heard and and this is
 
03:18:40.790 --> 03:18:40.800 align:start position:0%
an area where it seems to me like maybe
 
03:18:42.790 --> 03:18:42.800 align:start position:0%
there's an element they raise a good
 
03:18:44.710 --> 03:18:44.720 align:start position:0%
point is there a way for us to deal with
 
03:18:46.870 --> 03:18:46.880 align:start position:0%
it fairly so that they know that their
 
03:18:49.349 --> 03:18:49.359 align:start position:0%
opinion has been respected that's that's
 
03:18:50.870 --> 03:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
that's where i'm coming from and that's
 
03:18:53.670 --> 03:18:53.680 align:start position:0%
why i'm going to vote yes
 
03:18:58.389 --> 03:18:58.399 align:start position:0%
but i respect whatever vote you exercise
 
03:19:01.030 --> 03:19:01.040 align:start position:0%
i very much appreciate the clarification
 
03:19:04.870 --> 03:19:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:07.750 --> 03:19:07.760 align:start position:0%
so um with that let's take the straw
 
03:19:09.349 --> 03:19:09.359 align:start position:0%
vote on
 
03:19:11.830 --> 03:19:11.840 align:start position:0%
asking the working group to come back
 
03:19:14.550 --> 03:19:14.560 align:start position:0%
and take a look at a little supplemental
 
03:19:18.309 --> 03:19:18.319 align:start position:0%
language that would and would create an
 
03:19:19.990 --> 03:19:20.000 align:start position:0%
appeals process
 
03:19:22.070 --> 03:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
back to the administrator for a second
 
03:19:26.550 --> 03:19:26.560 align:start position:0%
review based on math errors and the like
 
03:19:34.630 --> 03:19:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:34.640 --> 03:19:35.590 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

03:19:35.590 --> 03:19:35.600 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:19:37.429 --> 03:19:37.439 align:start position:0%
it's technically written written here
 
03:19:39.990 --> 03:19:40.000 align:start position:0%
mathematical mistakes or miscalculations
 
03:19:40.000 --> 03:19:41.510 align:start position:0%
mathematical mistakes or miscalculations
and

03:19:41.510 --> 03:19:41.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:19:43.910 --> 03:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
you know i i think they can leverage the
 
03:19:43.920 --> 03:19:46.469 align:start position:0%
you know i i think they can leverage the
language

03:19:46.469 --> 03:19:46.479 align:start position:0%
language
 
03:19:47.830 --> 03:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
so with that
 
03:19:49.910 --> 03:19:49.920 align:start position:0%
if you agree
 
03:19:57.750 --> 03:19:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:00.870 --> 03:20:00.880 align:start position:0%
if you're opposed you'll raise your hand
 
03:20:03.670 --> 03:20:03.680 align:start position:0%
one two two okay
 
03:20:05.349 --> 03:20:05.359 align:start position:0%
all right i hopefully you can work with
 
03:20:05.359 --> 03:20:07.429 align:start position:0%
all right i hopefully you can work with
that

03:20:07.429 --> 03:20:07.439 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:20:09.030 --> 03:20:09.040 align:start position:0%
okay so with that
 
03:20:09.040 --> 03:20:09.910 align:start position:0%
okay so with that
uh

03:20:09.910 --> 03:20:09.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:20:12.309 --> 03:20:12.319 align:start position:0%
we're pretty much done there were some
 
03:20:12.319 --> 03:20:13.349 align:start position:0%
we're pretty much done there were some
supplement

03:20:13.349 --> 03:20:13.359 align:start position:0%
supplement
 
03:20:14.870 --> 03:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
we're done because we're out of time is
 
03:20:15.910 --> 03:20:15.920 align:start position:0%
the problem
 
03:20:18.070 --> 03:20:18.080 align:start position:0%
the the um
 
03:20:20.150 --> 03:20:20.160 align:start position:0%
we had
 
03:20:23.910 --> 03:20:23.920 align:start position:0%
i know i know but oh is that 4 20 yes
 
03:20:25.830 --> 03:20:25.840 align:start position:0%
oh my god
 
03:20:29.030 --> 03:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
oh we got lots of time i don't know what
 
03:20:31.110 --> 03:20:31.120 align:start position:0%
the pace we're going to do no no no no
 
03:20:33.190 --> 03:20:33.200 align:start position:0%
no we just finished up the plaintiff's
 
03:20:34.790 --> 03:20:34.800 align:start position:0%
piece of this and
 
03:20:34.800 --> 03:20:35.590 align:start position:0%
piece of this and
we

03:20:35.590 --> 03:20:35.600 align:start position:0%
we
 
03:20:37.990 --> 03:20:38.000 align:start position:0%
thank you so much i have a bad eye so
 
03:20:39.990 --> 03:20:40.000 align:start position:0%
when i looked that way my peripheral
 
03:20:42.630 --> 03:20:42.640 align:start position:0%
vision was not good thank you sir
 
03:20:43.910 --> 03:20:43.920 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
03:20:43.920 --> 03:20:44.630 align:start position:0%
okay so
uh

03:20:44.630 --> 03:20:44.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:20:48.229 --> 03:20:48.239 align:start position:0%
in caucus we talked about
 
03:20:50.070 --> 03:20:50.080 align:start position:0%
uh and and if you're looking for an
 
03:20:51.990 --> 03:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
estimate how long this is going to take
 
03:20:53.590 --> 03:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
this feels to me like it should just
 
03:20:57.830 --> 03:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
take another 20 30 minutes at most okay
 
03:20:57.840 --> 03:20:59.190 align:start position:0%
take another 20 30 minutes at most okay
so

03:20:59.190 --> 03:20:59.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:21:02.950 --> 03:21:02.960 align:start position:0%
in caucus there was a discussion on foss
 
03:21:05.030 --> 03:21:05.040 align:start position:0%
and the foss exemption i think we dealt
 
03:21:07.349 --> 03:21:07.359 align:start position:0%
with that earlier so that one's done
 
03:21:07.359 --> 03:21:11.110 align:start position:0%
with that earlier so that one's done
right

03:21:11.110 --> 03:21:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:13.269 --> 03:21:13.279 align:start position:0%
then there was something about uh
 
03:21:15.030 --> 03:21:15.040 align:start position:0%
whether or not
 
03:21:17.990 --> 03:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
the language on caps and having uh the
 
03:21:21.590 --> 03:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
cap the caps put on the judici on the
 
03:21:23.830 --> 03:21:23.840 align:start position:0%
awards were reasonable and then there
 
03:21:26.469 --> 03:21:26.479 align:start position:0%
was something about taking 25 percent
 
03:21:29.830 --> 03:21:29.840 align:start position:0%
out from the potential contingency fee
 
03:21:31.190 --> 03:21:31.200 align:start position:0%
do you want do you want to talk us
 
03:21:32.790 --> 03:21:32.800 align:start position:0%
through that representative was that
 
03:21:36.389 --> 03:21:36.399 align:start position:0%
your issue it was and if i may um and i
 
03:21:38.790 --> 03:21:38.800 align:start position:0%
uh i should note that
 
03:21:40.150 --> 03:21:40.160 align:start position:0%
attorney scolambrini and a
 
03:21:43.030 --> 03:21:43.040 align:start position:0%
representative of the um
 
03:21:44.710 --> 03:21:44.720 align:start position:0%
new hampshire association for justice
 
03:21:46.469 --> 03:21:46.479 align:start position:0%
are are here
 
03:21:48.950 --> 03:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
they raised this issue and i had a
 
03:21:51.269 --> 03:21:51.279 align:start position:0%
discussion uh with both of them but for
 
03:21:52.870 --> 03:21:52.880 align:start position:0%
but a pretty lengthy discussion with
 
03:21:55.750 --> 03:21:55.760 align:start position:0%
attorney scolambrini um who raised the
 
03:21:57.750 --> 03:21:57.760 align:start position:0%
issue and i think uh representative
 
03:21:59.750 --> 03:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
emerick you had raised this issue last
 
03:22:02.790 --> 03:22:02.800 align:start position:0%
time at our hearing that
 
03:22:07.030 --> 03:22:07.040 align:start position:0%
having the having the two stage 25
 
03:22:10.150 --> 03:22:10.160 align:start position:0%
percent 33 percent uh
 
03:22:11.990 --> 03:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
cap on attorneys fees
 
03:22:15.510 --> 03:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
uh could arguably encourage an attorney
 
03:22:19.030 --> 03:22:19.040 align:start position:0%
uh to to want to go to uh
 
03:22:21.670 --> 03:22:21.680 align:start position:0%
to to go through the the administrative
 
03:22:23.830 --> 03:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
adjudication i mean the administrative
 
03:22:25.349 --> 03:22:25.359 align:start position:0%
and having the administrator determine
 
03:22:27.750 --> 03:22:27.760 align:start position:0%
the case as opposed to settling earlier
 
03:22:29.349 --> 03:22:29.359 align:start position:0%
simply for the purpose of getting a
 
03:22:29.359 --> 03:22:30.309 align:start position:0%
simply for the purpose of getting a
higher

03:22:30.309 --> 03:22:30.319 align:start position:0%
higher
 
03:22:32.469 --> 03:22:32.479 align:start position:0%
attorney's fee i i should just note that
 
03:22:34.150 --> 03:22:34.160 align:start position:0%
if it were able to be proved that an
 
03:22:36.070 --> 03:22:36.080 align:start position:0%
attorney actually did that and that was
 
03:22:37.269 --> 03:22:37.279 align:start position:0%
the only reason for doing it the
 
03:22:38.870 --> 03:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
attorney would be subject to discipline
 
03:22:40.950 --> 03:22:40.960 align:start position:0%
i have no no doubt about that but
 
03:22:43.030 --> 03:22:43.040 align:start position:0%
proving that that happened was would be
 
03:22:47.030 --> 03:22:47.040 align:start position:0%
very very difficult to do so anyway
 
03:22:49.349 --> 03:22:49.359 align:start position:0%
uh what attorney scolombrini suggested
 
03:22:52.070 --> 03:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
and i think it makes sense is to take
 
03:22:52.080 --> 03:22:53.030 align:start position:0%
and i think it makes sense is to take
out

03:22:53.030 --> 03:22:53.040 align:start position:0%
out
 
03:22:56.550 --> 03:22:56.560 align:start position:0%
that the two-stage uh process so what i
 
03:22:58.389 --> 03:22:58.399 align:start position:0%
have proposed here
 
03:23:03.030 --> 03:23:03.040 align:start position:0%
um uh is uh in this is the second
 
03:23:03.040 --> 03:23:03.990 align:start position:0%
um uh is uh in this is the second
uh

03:23:03.990 --> 03:23:04.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:23:06.550 --> 03:23:06.560 align:start position:0%
item down it's number 14
 
03:23:08.870 --> 03:23:08.880 align:start position:0%
uh roman numeral 14 and it's it reads it
 
03:23:11.110 --> 03:23:11.120 align:start position:0%
would change the existing bill to read
 
03:23:12.229 --> 03:23:12.239 align:start position:0%
as follows
 
03:23:14.150 --> 03:23:14.160 align:start position:0%
the administrator may approve
 
03:23:17.750 --> 03:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
i want to call a out there okay so using
 
03:23:19.830 --> 03:23:19.840 align:start position:0%
uh the umberger amendment
 
03:23:19.840 --> 03:23:21.830 align:start position:0%
uh the umberger amendment
0891

03:23:21.830 --> 03:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
0891
 
03:23:24.469 --> 03:23:24.479 align:start position:0%
what page and what line item are you
 
03:23:27.110 --> 03:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
wanting us to jump into yes i'm sorry
 
03:23:28.870 --> 03:23:28.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:23:30.550 --> 03:23:30.560 align:start position:0%
it is on
 
03:23:33.830 --> 03:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
page line 27 8
 
03:23:36.229 --> 03:23:36.239 align:start position:0%
line 27
 
03:23:36.239 --> 03:23:37.030 align:start position:0%
line 27
uh

03:23:37.030 --> 03:23:37.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:23:41.110 --> 03:23:41.120 align:start position:0%
right yes line 27 so that uh which is
 
03:23:43.429 --> 03:23:43.439 align:start position:0%
roman numeral 14
 
03:23:46.389 --> 03:23:46.399 align:start position:0%
and so that paragraph would
 
03:23:49.670 --> 03:23:49.680 align:start position:0%
be removed and substituted would be
 
03:23:51.110 --> 03:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
the following
 
03:23:53.030 --> 03:23:53.040 align:start position:0%
the administrator may approve all fees
 
03:23:55.349 --> 03:23:55.359 align:start position:0%
and costs of the attorneys who represent
 
03:23:56.950 --> 03:23:56.960 align:start position:0%
claimants and proceedings before the
 
03:23:59.030 --> 03:23:59.040 align:start position:0%
administrator the administrator shall
 
03:24:02.150 --> 03:24:02.160 align:start position:0%
not approve any request for an attorney
 
03:24:05.030 --> 03:24:05.040 align:start position:0%
for an attorney uh fees
 
03:24:06.790 --> 03:24:06.800 align:start position:0%
for attorney's fees or caught there's a
 
03:24:09.110 --> 03:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
typo there but for attorney's fees or
 
03:24:11.910 --> 03:24:11.920 align:start position:0%
costs which are not reasonable
 
03:24:13.590 --> 03:24:13.600 align:start position:0%
the administrator shall not approve an
 
03:24:16.309 --> 03:24:16.319 align:start position:0%
attorney's fee in excess of 33 and 30
 
03:24:19.030 --> 03:24:19.040 align:start position:0%
percent of the amount of the award
 
03:24:20.870 --> 03:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
all costs and attorneys fees paid to the
 
03:24:22.950 --> 03:24:22.960 align:start position:0%
claimant's attorney shall be paid from
 
03:24:25.510 --> 03:24:25.520 align:start position:0%
the amount awarded to the claimant it's
 
03:24:28.309 --> 03:24:28.319 align:start position:0%
that sort of takes out there's only one
 
03:24:30.070 --> 03:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
there's only there's only one cap on
 
03:24:32.550 --> 03:24:32.560 align:start position:0%
fees it's 33 in the third percent
 
03:24:33.990 --> 03:24:34.000 align:start position:0%
that doesn't mean the administrator has
 
03:24:35.429 --> 03:24:35.439 align:start position:0%
to award that the administrator can
 
03:24:36.950 --> 03:24:36.960 align:start position:0%
award a lower amount if that's the
 
03:24:39.349 --> 03:24:39.359 align:start position:0%
reasonable amount but 33 and a third is
 
03:24:40.790 --> 03:24:40.800 align:start position:0%
the cap
 
03:24:44.150 --> 03:24:44.160 align:start position:0%
whether it the case resolves early
 
03:24:47.190 --> 03:24:47.200 align:start position:0%
or at following a full adjudication and
 
03:24:49.110 --> 03:24:49.120 align:start position:0%
i think it's ernie scombre's
 
03:24:50.469 --> 03:24:50.479 align:start position:0%
point on this and i think it's well
 
03:24:52.309 --> 03:24:52.319 align:start position:0%
taken is
 
03:24:54.950 --> 03:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
very often the reason that a case will
 
03:24:56.710 --> 03:24:56.720 align:start position:0%
resolve early
 
03:24:58.950 --> 03:24:58.960 align:start position:0%
is the attorney for the claimant has put
 
03:25:00.469 --> 03:25:00.479 align:start position:0%
in a lot of work
 
03:25:03.349 --> 03:25:03.359 align:start position:0%
to put the case together and to convince
 
03:25:05.590 --> 03:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
the attorney general that the case is
 
03:25:09.030 --> 03:25:09.040 align:start position:0%
worth settling early um and the and the
 
03:25:09.040 --> 03:25:09.830 align:start position:0%
worth settling early um and the and the
the

03:25:09.830 --> 03:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:25:11.670 --> 03:25:11.680 align:start position:0%
the claimant and the attorney
 
03:25:12.950 --> 03:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
representing the claimant shouldn't be
 
03:25:15.269 --> 03:25:15.279 align:start position:0%
penalized if they've done that work so i
 
03:25:18.070 --> 03:25:18.080 align:start position:0%
think that's if and that that would i
 
03:25:20.469 --> 03:25:20.479 align:start position:0%
think i've accurately summarized what
 
03:25:23.190 --> 03:25:23.200 align:start position:0%
attorney brainy would would say so so
 
03:25:25.349 --> 03:25:25.359 align:start position:0%
let's go ahead and get you on record why
 
03:25:27.030 --> 03:25:27.040 align:start position:0%
don't you come up and and use the
 
03:25:29.429 --> 03:25:29.439 align:start position:0%
microphone here and introduce yourself
 
03:25:31.830 --> 03:25:31.840 align:start position:0%
and just state what your position is
 
03:25:33.590 --> 03:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
relative to what representative lynn
 
03:25:43.830 --> 03:25:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:45.190 --> 03:25:45.200 align:start position:0%
mr chairman my name is anthony
 
03:25:49.349 --> 03:25:49.359 align:start position:0%
scullenbriny i'm here on behalf of nhaj
 
03:25:50.710 --> 03:25:50.720 align:start position:0%
the last name
 
03:25:53.269 --> 03:25:53.279 align:start position:0%
i hope oh man if you thought this ananza
 
03:26:00.550 --> 03:26:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:03.910 --> 03:26:03.920 align:start position:0%
is my last name i i work out of a small
 
03:26:06.550 --> 03:26:06.560 align:start position:0%
firm it's me and a former prosecutor
 
03:26:08.550 --> 03:26:08.560 align:start position:0%
leslie gill we run gill and skull and
 
03:26:10.309 --> 03:26:10.319 align:start position:0%
briny in nashua
 
03:26:12.630 --> 03:26:12.640 align:start position:0%
i've practiced in new hampshire for a
 
03:26:15.190 --> 03:26:15.200 align:start position:0%
long time and i've done cases involving
 
03:26:17.190 --> 03:26:17.200 align:start position:0%
kids that have been abused i've also
 
03:26:18.710 --> 03:26:18.720 align:start position:0%
actually practiced the public defender
 
03:26:20.630 --> 03:26:20.640 align:start position:0%
where i represented kids that were in
 
03:26:22.229 --> 03:26:22.239 align:start position:0%
the process of being abused while being
 
03:26:25.590 --> 03:26:25.600 align:start position:0%
held at ydc uh so i've had a different
 
03:26:27.030 --> 03:26:27.040 align:start position:0%
perspective than
 
03:26:28.389 --> 03:26:28.399 align:start position:0%
the other people that have testified in
 
03:26:30.150 --> 03:26:30.160 align:start position:0%
front of you
 
03:26:32.710 --> 03:26:32.720 align:start position:0%
representative lin accurately summarized
 
03:26:33.990 --> 03:26:34.000 align:start position:0%
my position
 
03:26:36.550 --> 03:26:36.560 align:start position:0%
and i think that the reason why this is
 
03:26:37.990 --> 03:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
the better way to go
 
03:26:40.309 --> 03:26:40.319 align:start position:0%
is because in looking at how
 
03:26:42.309 --> 03:26:42.319 align:start position:0%
similar mass torts have been handled in
 
03:26:44.389 --> 03:26:44.399 align:start position:0%
other jurisdictions specifically in
 
03:26:47.590 --> 03:26:47.600 align:start position:0%
federal court there is uh a process by
 
03:26:50.710 --> 03:26:50.720 align:start position:0%
which the plaintiff's council submits a
 
03:26:52.469 --> 03:26:52.479 align:start position:0%
request for a fee
 
03:26:55.110 --> 03:26:55.120 align:start position:0%
in a for example a class action and then
 
03:26:57.830 --> 03:26:57.840 align:start position:0%
the judge evaluates the merits of the
 
03:27:00.150 --> 03:27:00.160 align:start position:0%
fee and in doing that they've generated
 
03:27:02.070 --> 03:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
case law in this point and one of the
 
03:27:03.590 --> 03:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
things that the case law says over and
 
03:27:06.630 --> 03:27:06.640 align:start position:0%
over again is that there is a value to
 
03:27:09.510 --> 03:27:09.520 align:start position:0%
the plaintiffs and having an expeditious
 
03:27:12.229 --> 03:27:12.239 align:start position:0%
resolution and i can think from my own
 
03:27:15.030 --> 03:27:15.040 align:start position:0%
personal examples the number of cases
 
03:27:17.590 --> 03:27:17.600 align:start position:0%
that i've had involving similar
 
03:27:20.070 --> 03:27:20.080 align:start position:0%
situations to this that resolved
 
03:27:22.550 --> 03:27:22.560 align:start position:0%
pre-suit are all of them
 
03:27:25.110 --> 03:27:25.120 align:start position:0%
you know when i take a case like this it
 
03:27:27.030 --> 03:27:27.040 align:start position:0%
represents a significant risk to me
 
03:27:29.269 --> 03:27:29.279 align:start position:0%
personally i can tell you that cases
 
03:27:31.429 --> 03:27:31.439 align:start position:0%
that we've had that are similar to cases
 
03:27:33.830 --> 03:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
like these require an enormous amount of
 
03:27:36.630 --> 03:27:36.640 align:start position:0%
expense on the front end on our part
 
03:27:38.389 --> 03:27:38.399 align:start position:0%
we're putting our money that could
 
03:27:39.670 --> 03:27:39.680 align:start position:0%
otherwise be
 
03:27:41.670 --> 03:27:41.680 align:start position:0%
sent home to you know get a new car or
 
03:27:43.750 --> 03:27:43.760 align:start position:0%
something else we're putting that money
 
03:27:46.150 --> 03:27:46.160 align:start position:0%
on the table because it's a contingency
 
03:27:48.550 --> 03:27:48.560 align:start position:0%
fee we won't get that money back unless
 
03:27:53.030 --> 03:27:53.040 align:start position:0%
we collect for the injured party and so
 
03:27:55.590 --> 03:27:55.600 align:start position:0%
that gives attorneys in this system a
 
03:27:57.670 --> 03:27:57.680 align:start position:0%
real incentive to take meritorious cases
 
03:27:59.429 --> 03:27:59.439 align:start position:0%
and that's not to say that all the cases
 
03:28:00.790 --> 03:28:00.800 align:start position:0%
are meritorious so that all the
 
03:28:03.190 --> 03:28:03.200 align:start position:0%
attorneys take meritorious cases but the
 
03:28:04.670 --> 03:28:04.680 align:start position:0%
idea that you would
 
03:28:06.950 --> 03:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
disincentivize working things up ahead
 
03:28:08.070 --> 03:28:08.080 align:start position:0%
of time
 
03:28:10.790 --> 03:28:10.800 align:start position:0%
and encourage people to go to this
 
03:28:13.269 --> 03:28:13.279 align:start position:0%
hearings process sort of
 
03:28:15.670 --> 03:28:15.680 align:start position:0%
cuts against the purpose of the bill the
 
03:28:17.990 --> 03:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
purpose of the bill is to make a
 
03:28:20.790 --> 03:28:20.800 align:start position:0%
victim-centered expeditious process to
 
03:28:23.429 --> 03:28:23.439 align:start position:0%
resolve these claims and i think that
 
03:28:25.510 --> 03:28:25.520 align:start position:0%
good attorneys and this is going to
 
03:28:27.269 --> 03:28:27.279 align:start position:0%
sound corny but my experience in new
 
03:28:29.269 --> 03:28:29.279 align:start position:0%
hampshire is that most of the attorneys
 
03:28:32.389 --> 03:28:32.399 align:start position:0%
are good attorneys will recognize the
 
03:28:34.870 --> 03:28:34.880 align:start position:0%
value to their clients to whom they have
 
03:28:37.030 --> 03:28:37.040 align:start position:0%
an ethical obligation to resolve these
 
03:28:39.429 --> 03:28:39.439 align:start position:0%
claims as soon as possible and so if you
 
03:28:41.670 --> 03:28:41.680 align:start position:0%
create this unusual incentive to stretch
 
03:28:44.309 --> 03:28:44.319 align:start position:0%
it out my fear is that that that
 
03:28:47.030 --> 03:28:47.040 align:start position:0%
incentive could be abused or
 
03:28:49.030 --> 03:28:49.040 align:start position:0%
that that incentive could be something
 
03:28:51.510 --> 03:28:51.520 align:start position:0%
that becomes systemically disruptive to
 
03:28:53.349 --> 03:28:53.359 align:start position:0%
the process
 
03:28:55.429 --> 03:28:55.439 align:start position:0%
so thank you for that and and maybe
 
03:28:57.110 --> 03:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
maybe you're not the right one to ask
 
03:29:01.429 --> 03:29:01.439 align:start position:0%
this but i'll i'll ask anyways um
 
03:29:04.150 --> 03:29:04.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't giving the administrator the
 
03:29:04.160 --> 03:29:05.429 align:start position:0%
doesn't giving the administrator the
discretion

03:29:05.429 --> 03:29:05.439 align:start position:0%
discretion
 
03:29:08.550 --> 03:29:08.560 align:start position:0%
to approve attorneys fees up to 33 and a
 
03:29:09.990 --> 03:29:10.000 align:start position:0%
third percent
 
03:29:14.229 --> 03:29:14.239 align:start position:0%
that doesn't that also create a an odd
 
03:29:17.990 --> 03:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
incentive for the administrator to
 
03:29:20.309 --> 03:29:20.319 align:start position:0%
basically rubber stamp 33 and a third
 
03:29:22.469 --> 03:29:22.479 align:start position:0%
for every case
 
03:29:24.309 --> 03:29:24.319 align:start position:0%
you know i i think that that's something
 
03:29:26.550 --> 03:29:26.560 align:start position:0%
that is really governed by the norms of
 
03:29:29.190 --> 03:29:29.200 align:start position:0%
practice for civil plaintiff cases and
 
03:29:32.229 --> 03:29:32.239 align:start position:0%
oftentimes that is the the number that's
 
03:29:34.389 --> 03:29:34.399 align:start position:0%
set i know that there are places where
 
03:29:37.110 --> 03:29:37.120 align:start position:0%
they vary for example in this state if
 
03:29:38.710 --> 03:29:38.720 align:start position:0%
you're representing somebody under this
 
03:29:40.710 --> 03:29:40.720 align:start position:0%
age of 18
 
03:29:43.830 --> 03:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
the statute provides a cap of 25 and i
 
03:29:46.070 --> 03:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
point out that that statute has been in
 
03:29:49.030 --> 03:29:49.040 align:start position:0%
effect for a long time and it provides
 
03:29:51.110 --> 03:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
less incentive for cases involving kids
 
03:29:53.269 --> 03:29:53.279 align:start position:0%
to come forward which is in part why
 
03:29:54.950 --> 03:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
this problem has taken so long to get
 
03:29:56.950 --> 03:29:56.960 align:start position:0%
addressed so
 
03:29:58.309 --> 03:29:58.319 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
03:30:00.469 --> 03:30:00.479 align:start position:0%
the incentive issue
 
03:30:02.070 --> 03:30:02.080 align:start position:0%
is something that we can deal with that
 
03:30:04.389 --> 03:30:04.399 align:start position:0%
we've dealt with before but you know
 
03:30:06.870 --> 03:30:06.880 align:start position:0%
there are cases that go against the norm
 
03:30:09.269 --> 03:30:09.279 align:start position:0%
in civil practice and ask for higher
 
03:30:11.670 --> 03:30:11.680 align:start position:0%
amounts on a contingency fee such as
 
03:30:14.150 --> 03:30:14.160 align:start position:0%
medical malpractice cases in some places
 
03:30:16.550 --> 03:30:16.560 align:start position:0%
slip and fall cases where they'll have a
 
03:30:18.550 --> 03:30:18.560 align:start position:0%
variance from the norm of 33 and a third
 
03:30:21.429 --> 03:30:21.439 align:start position:0%
percent but i think is that as the limit
 
03:30:23.429 --> 03:30:23.439 align:start position:0%
is fundamentally fair and reasonable
 
03:30:25.590 --> 03:30:25.600 align:start position:0%
because that's what's being done out in
 
03:30:27.990 --> 03:30:28.000 align:start position:0%
the marketplace right now
 
03:30:29.269 --> 03:30:29.279 align:start position:0%
so so
 
03:30:31.910 --> 03:30:31.920 align:start position:0%
um i understand that but the part of
 
03:30:33.830 --> 03:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
this that uh maybe you could help me
 
03:30:35.750 --> 03:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
with is
 
03:30:39.269 --> 03:30:39.279 align:start position:0%
early on in the process when the victim
 
03:30:41.590 --> 03:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
shows up to talk to an attorney and they
 
03:30:43.590 --> 03:30:43.600 align:start position:0%
start talking through the case and start
 
03:30:45.590 --> 03:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
talking through the implications of of
 
03:30:47.990 --> 03:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
how much money could be received i would
 
03:30:50.550 --> 03:30:50.560 align:start position:0%
think early on the attorney would want
 
03:30:53.110 --> 03:30:53.120 align:start position:0%
to uh point out what their contingency
 
03:30:55.349 --> 03:30:55.359 align:start position:0%
fee would be if it's a variable
 
03:30:58.309 --> 03:30:58.319 align:start position:0%
rate like this where we you know you
 
03:31:00.870 --> 03:31:00.880 align:start position:0%
don't know until the end of it
 
03:31:03.830 --> 03:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
how how would the attorney
 
03:31:04.950 --> 03:31:04.960 align:start position:0%
give the
 
03:31:04.960 --> 03:31:06.229 align:start position:0%
give the
information

03:31:06.229 --> 03:31:06.239 align:start position:0%
information
 
03:31:08.950 --> 03:31:08.960 align:start position:0%
early enough so that the victim knows
 
03:31:10.790 --> 03:31:10.800 align:start position:0%
what they're dealing with
 
03:31:12.469 --> 03:31:12.479 align:start position:0%
you know this is an issue that's dealt
 
03:31:13.670 --> 03:31:13.680 align:start position:0%
with all the time by lawyers that
 
03:31:15.750 --> 03:31:15.760 align:start position:0%
represent plaintiffs in class actions
 
03:31:17.429 --> 03:31:17.439 align:start position:0%
and i believe the way that it's normally
 
03:31:19.510 --> 03:31:19.520 align:start position:0%
done is that you explain to them that
 
03:31:22.870 --> 03:31:22.880 align:start position:0%
the cap is this much and you could get
 
03:31:24.469 --> 03:31:24.479 align:start position:0%
up to that much as your fee but it's
 
03:31:25.590 --> 03:31:25.600 align:start position:0%
like it's possible that the
 
03:31:27.830 --> 03:31:27.840 align:start position:0%
administrator could ask for less and
 
03:31:30.150 --> 03:31:30.160 align:start position:0%
that the statute controls the fee by
 
03:31:32.469 --> 03:31:32.479 align:start position:0%
giving discretion to the administrator i
 
03:31:33.750 --> 03:31:33.760 align:start position:0%
mean it's the same thing when you
 
03:31:35.190 --> 03:31:35.200 align:start position:0%
represent somebody in a criminal case
 
03:31:36.229 --> 03:31:36.239 align:start position:0%
you don't know what their sentence is
 
03:31:37.910 --> 03:31:37.920 align:start position:0%
going to be you don't know whether the
 
03:31:39.830 --> 03:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
jury is going to find them guilty or not
 
03:31:41.590 --> 03:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
and we still deal with that uncertainty
 
03:31:43.269 --> 03:31:43.279 align:start position:0%
all the time so i don't think it's
 
03:31:46.309 --> 03:31:46.319 align:start position:0%
necessarily an unworkable system to have
 
03:31:48.950 --> 03:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
it be left to the administrator because
 
03:31:50.630 --> 03:31:50.640 align:start position:0%
it happens all the time in mass tort
 
03:31:53.990 --> 03:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
cases in federal court every day
 
03:31:56.150 --> 03:31:56.160 align:start position:0%
so mr attorney general you do you have
 
03:31:57.910 --> 03:31:57.920 align:start position:0%
the language that's been proposed and
 
03:31:59.750 --> 03:31:59.760 align:start position:0%
there's just one typo in there that
 
03:32:02.950 --> 03:32:02.960 align:start position:0%
representative lynn pointed out but um
 
03:32:05.110 --> 03:32:05.120 align:start position:0%
do you have any comment do you think
 
03:32:07.190 --> 03:32:07.200 align:start position:0%
this is improves the bill that we have
 
03:32:09.670 --> 03:32:09.680 align:start position:0%
or or not
 
03:32:11.510 --> 03:32:11.520 align:start position:0%
yeah i mean i i would agree with
 
03:32:13.190 --> 03:32:13.200 align:start position:0%
attorney scalimbrini and representative
 
03:32:15.910 --> 03:32:15.920 align:start position:0%
lin regarding i think the point was well
 
03:32:17.670 --> 03:32:17.680 align:start position:0%
taken regarding the incentives and we
 
03:32:19.110 --> 03:32:19.120 align:start position:0%
had talked about that i think in a
 
03:32:21.030 --> 03:32:21.040 align:start position:0%
previous hearing that
 
03:32:23.830 --> 03:32:23.840 align:start position:0%
you know to have a potential higher
 
03:32:26.550 --> 03:32:26.560 align:start position:0%
higher cap on attorney's fees if you
 
03:32:26.560 --> 03:32:27.349 align:start position:0%
higher cap on attorney's fees if you
take

03:32:27.349 --> 03:32:27.359 align:start position:0%
take
 
03:32:29.429 --> 03:32:29.439 align:start position:0%
a claim through the resolution process
 
03:32:31.349 --> 03:32:31.359 align:start position:0%
could potentially provide a
 
03:32:34.229 --> 03:32:34.239 align:start position:0%
perverse incentive to to drag drag the
 
03:32:36.309 --> 03:32:36.319 align:start position:0%
case out
 
03:32:38.309 --> 03:32:38.319 align:start position:0%
i do think in reality you know attorney
 
03:32:40.070 --> 03:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
an attorney is governed by their ethical
 
03:32:41.750 --> 03:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
obligations and if it's better for their
 
03:32:44.229 --> 03:32:44.239 align:start position:0%
client to settle earlier i i think the
 
03:32:45.750 --> 03:32:45.760 align:start position:0%
vast majority of attorneys we wouldn't
 
03:32:47.429 --> 03:32:47.439 align:start position:0%
have to worry that they'd just drag a
 
03:32:48.870 --> 03:32:48.880 align:start position:0%
case out in order to get higher
 
03:32:50.790 --> 03:32:50.800 align:start position:0%
attorneys fees but i think i think that
 
03:32:53.030 --> 03:32:53.040 align:start position:0%
incentive point was well taken i also
 
03:32:54.229 --> 03:32:54.239 align:start position:0%
agree that
 
03:32:54.239 --> 03:32:55.110 align:start position:0%
agree that
um

03:32:55.110 --> 03:32:55.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:32:56.389 --> 03:32:56.399 align:start position:0%
that we certainly wouldn't want to
 
03:32:56.399 --> 03:32:58.070 align:start position:0%
that we certainly wouldn't want to
disincentivize

03:32:58.070 --> 03:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
disincentivize
 
03:33:00.229 --> 03:33:00.239 align:start position:0%
good work up front to avoid having to go
 
03:33:02.550 --> 03:33:02.560 align:start position:0%
through a resolution process
 
03:33:03.750 --> 03:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
i would also agree with attorney
 
03:33:06.630 --> 03:33:06.640 align:start position:0%
scalimbrini on the concern that
 
03:33:06.640 --> 03:33:09.190 align:start position:0%
scalimbrini on the concern that
um

03:33:09.190 --> 03:33:09.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:11.750 --> 03:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
that having a sort of that there would
 
03:33:15.190 --> 03:33:15.200 align:start position:0%
be uncertainty with uh with a cap like
 
03:33:17.750 --> 03:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
this i i think i agree it's not that
 
03:33:20.150 --> 03:33:20.160 align:start position:0%
uncommon for
 
03:33:20.160 --> 03:33:21.349 align:start position:0%
uncommon for
for

03:33:21.349 --> 03:33:21.359 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:33:23.670 --> 03:33:23.680 align:start position:0%
you know an attorney and a client in in
 
03:33:25.429 --> 03:33:25.439 align:start position:0%
certain kinds of cases especially master
 
03:33:27.269 --> 03:33:27.279 align:start position:0%
cases or other other types of cases to
 
03:33:29.510 --> 03:33:29.520 align:start position:0%
have a negotiation regarding what the
 
03:33:31.030 --> 03:33:31.040 align:start position:0%
attorney's contingency fee is going to
 
03:33:33.269 --> 03:33:33.279 align:start position:0%
be and then get to the end of the case
 
03:33:35.269 --> 03:33:35.279 align:start position:0%
and you still have to go
 
03:33:37.510 --> 03:33:37.520 align:start position:0%
and and get get your
 
03:33:39.269 --> 03:33:39.279 align:start position:0%
your award of attorney's fee or your
 
03:33:41.190 --> 03:33:41.200 align:start position:0%
your attorney fee number confirmed by
 
03:33:42.630 --> 03:33:42.640 align:start position:0%
the court in this case it'd be the
 
03:33:44.630 --> 03:33:44.640 align:start position:0%
administrator and so
 
03:33:46.389 --> 03:33:46.399 align:start position:0%
it's not that uncommon to have some
 
03:33:48.469 --> 03:33:48.479 align:start position:0%
level of uncertainty there but i think
 
03:33:50.469 --> 03:33:50.479 align:start position:0%
what the client will know when they
 
03:33:53.030 --> 03:33:53.040 align:start position:0%
negotiate with their attorney is
 
03:33:54.389 --> 03:33:54.399 align:start position:0%
they'll know that it's not going to be
 
03:33:55.590 --> 03:33:55.600 align:start position:0%
any higher than what's in their
 
03:33:55.600 --> 03:33:56.790 align:start position:0%
any higher than what's in their
agreement

03:33:56.790 --> 03:33:56.800 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
03:33:56.800 --> 03:33:57.670 align:start position:0%
agreement
and

03:33:57.670 --> 03:33:57.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:33:59.349 --> 03:33:59.359 align:start position:0%
my sense is
 
03:34:01.030 --> 03:34:01.040 align:start position:0%
is that
 
03:34:03.349 --> 03:34:03.359 align:start position:0%
if this number is in the bill
 
03:34:03.359 --> 03:34:04.550 align:start position:0%
if this number is in the bill
any

03:34:04.550 --> 03:34:04.560 align:start position:0%
any
 
03:34:04.560 --> 03:34:05.830 align:start position:0%
any
client

03:34:05.830 --> 03:34:05.840 align:start position:0%
client
 
03:34:07.269 --> 03:34:07.279 align:start position:0%
who's going to go through this prior any
 
03:34:08.309 --> 03:34:08.319 align:start position:0%
claimant is going to go through this
 
03:34:09.990 --> 03:34:10.000 align:start position:0%
process they'll they'll probably have
 
03:34:11.910 --> 03:34:11.920 align:start position:0%
that discussion with their attorney they
 
03:34:14.550 --> 03:34:14.560 align:start position:0%
will know that the that the number is
 
03:34:16.070 --> 03:34:16.080 align:start position:0%
the highest potential number is going to
 
03:34:18.710 --> 03:34:18.720 align:start position:0%
be 33 and a third percent so all that to
 
03:34:20.950 --> 03:34:20.960 align:start position:0%
say that was another long answer but
 
03:34:22.630 --> 03:34:22.640 align:start position:0%
i i generally think this is an
 
03:34:24.710 --> 03:34:24.720 align:start position:0%
improvement and i and i am in general
 
03:34:26.550 --> 03:34:26.560 align:start position:0%
agreement with attorneys gallon bruni's
 
03:34:26.560 --> 03:34:27.830 align:start position:0%
agreement with attorneys gallon bruni's
comments

03:34:27.830 --> 03:34:27.840 align:start position:0%
comments
 
03:34:29.670 --> 03:34:29.680 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any other comments
 
03:34:33.750 --> 03:34:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:36.309 --> 03:34:36.319 align:start position:0%
all right so i'm i'm not sensing any
 
03:34:39.429 --> 03:34:39.439 align:start position:0%
opposition to this so without anyone
 
03:34:41.349 --> 03:34:41.359 align:start position:0%
stopping me i'm just gonna ask the
 
03:34:43.910 --> 03:34:43.920 align:start position:0%
working group to adopt this language as
 
03:34:45.910 --> 03:34:45.920 align:start position:0%
replacement language and
 
03:34:47.590 --> 03:34:47.600 align:start position:0%
you know just do it
 
03:34:50.070 --> 03:34:50.080 align:start position:0%
substantially in the same way fix a typo
 
03:34:51.990 --> 03:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
or two but
 
03:34:53.590 --> 03:34:53.600 align:start position:0%
i think we're we're okay with this
 
03:34:56.950 --> 03:34:56.960 align:start position:0%
direction anyone would disagree
 
03:34:56.960 --> 03:34:58.229 align:start position:0%
direction anyone would disagree
nope

03:34:58.229 --> 03:34:58.239 align:start position:0%
nope
 
03:35:00.790 --> 03:35:00.800 align:start position:0%
all right so um
 
03:35:03.030 --> 03:35:03.040 align:start position:0%
so thank you we're getting ready to talk
 
03:35:05.269 --> 03:35:05.279 align:start position:0%
about right to know is that is that your
 
03:35:08.550 --> 03:35:08.560 align:start position:0%
topic or do you want to go back to the
 
03:35:11.349 --> 03:35:11.359 align:start position:0%
cheap seats my goal is to make this as
 
03:35:13.030 --> 03:35:13.040 align:start position:0%
easy and as quick as possible for you
 
03:35:15.830 --> 03:35:15.840 align:start position:0%
guys so mr chair for the record my name
 
03:35:19.070 --> 03:35:19.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:20.309 --> 03:35:20.319 align:start position:0%
m-a-r-i-s-s-a-c-h-a-s-e i'm the
 
03:35:21.590 --> 03:35:21.600 align:start position:0%
executive director for the new hampshire
 
03:35:23.349 --> 03:35:23.359 align:start position:0%
association for justice
 
03:35:25.190 --> 03:35:25.200 align:start position:0%
i bring tony to as many legislative
 
03:35:27.750 --> 03:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
hearings as i can because he's sustained
 
03:35:31.269 --> 03:35:31.279 align:start position:0%
he succinct distinct and has a lot of
 
03:35:32.950 --> 03:35:32.960 align:start position:0%
real-world professional and personal
 
03:35:34.950 --> 03:35:34.960 align:start position:0%
experience across all areas of criminal
 
03:35:37.590 --> 03:35:37.600 align:start position:0%
and civil law so you know certainly if
 
03:35:39.190 --> 03:35:39.200 align:start position:0%
there are others in the room that are
 
03:35:41.990 --> 03:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
more um you know focused on the right to
 
03:35:44.229 --> 03:35:44.239 align:start position:0%
know issues would gladly
 
03:35:46.469 --> 03:35:46.479 align:start position:0%
you know switch places with them but i
 
03:35:48.710 --> 03:35:48.720 align:start position:0%
also trust tony's legal brain to provide
 
03:35:50.070 --> 03:35:50.080 align:start position:0%
any insight that might be helpful on
 
03:35:51.349 --> 03:35:51.359 align:start position:0%
this piece or any other piece of the
 
03:35:51.359 --> 03:35:54.070 align:start position:0%
this piece or any other piece of the
bill

03:35:54.070 --> 03:35:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:55.830 --> 03:35:55.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:35:57.670 --> 03:35:57.680 align:start position:0%
do we have any language on the
 
03:36:00.389 --> 03:36:00.399 align:start position:0%
substitute for right i do and this would
 
03:36:02.229 --> 03:36:02.239 align:start position:0%
be uh in
 
03:36:04.790 --> 03:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
this would be on page
 
03:36:06.950 --> 03:36:06.960 align:start position:0%
eight uh page nine i'm sorry
 
03:36:10.150 --> 03:36:10.160 align:start position:0%
in roman numeral 13. yeah but there's an
 
03:36:12.710 --> 03:36:12.720 align:start position:0%
error in that roman numeral i think
 
03:36:14.389 --> 03:36:14.399 align:start position:0%
i think that should be
 
03:36:17.349 --> 03:36:17.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:19.349 --> 03:36:19.359 align:start position:0%
oh right now you're right doesn't go
 
03:36:22.309 --> 03:36:22.319 align:start position:0%
alone 14 it should be six right it
 
03:36:25.429 --> 03:36:25.439 align:start position:0%
should be 16. on page nine where it says
 
03:36:27.030 --> 03:36:27.040 align:start position:0%
roman numeral
 
03:36:29.429 --> 03:36:29.439 align:start position:0%
in in amendment
 
03:36:31.510 --> 03:36:31.520 align:start position:0%
0891 it's
 
03:36:33.590 --> 03:36:33.600 align:start position:0%
yeah line eight it should be
 
03:36:35.030 --> 03:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
should be
 
03:36:37.910 --> 03:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
16 but it's on line eight page nine
 
03:36:37.920 --> 03:36:38.950 align:start position:0%
16 but it's on line eight page nine
um

03:36:38.950 --> 03:36:38.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:36:38.960 --> 03:36:39.830 align:start position:0%
um
so

03:36:39.830 --> 03:36:39.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:36:39.840 --> 03:36:41.429 align:start position:0%
so
what

03:36:41.429 --> 03:36:41.439 align:start position:0%
what
 
03:36:43.510 --> 03:36:43.520 align:start position:0%
what i would propose
 
03:36:43.520 --> 03:36:45.030 align:start position:0%
what i would propose
is

03:36:45.030 --> 03:36:45.040 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:36:47.110 --> 03:36:47.120 align:start position:0%
two so just so the clerk can keep up
 
03:36:49.510 --> 03:36:49.520 align:start position:0%
we're talking about page nine starting
 
03:36:52.309 --> 03:36:52.319 align:start position:0%
at line eight probably running through
 
03:36:54.070 --> 03:36:54.080 align:start position:0%
line twelve is that correct that's
 
03:36:56.630 --> 03:36:56.640 align:start position:0%
correct position on the page
 
03:36:58.630 --> 03:36:58.640 align:start position:0%
oh it's the third it's the last one down
 
03:37:00.070 --> 03:37:00.080 align:start position:0%
the last one down
 
03:37:00.080 --> 03:37:00.950 align:start position:0%
the last one down
um

03:37:00.950 --> 03:37:00.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:37:04.870 --> 03:37:04.880 align:start position:0%
so it and it uh and so it should uh
 
03:37:06.469 --> 03:37:06.479 align:start position:0%
as i say there's a typo there it should
 
03:37:08.870 --> 03:37:08.880 align:start position:0%
be section 16 but anyway what it'll the
 
03:37:12.070 --> 03:37:12.080 align:start position:0%
way it will read the uh that the new
 
03:37:14.150 --> 03:37:14.160 align:start position:0%
language would be
 
03:37:16.469 --> 03:37:16.479 align:start position:0%
records of the youth development center
 
03:37:19.510 --> 03:37:19.520 align:start position:0%
claims administration and the ydc
 
03:37:20.950 --> 03:37:20.960 align:start position:0%
settlement fund
 
03:37:24.309 --> 03:37:24.319 align:start position:0%
pursuant to rsa 21 m
 
03:37:27.429 --> 03:37:27.439 align:start position:0%
uh 11 dash should be a small a not a
 
03:37:29.590 --> 03:37:29.600 align:start position:0%
capital a but dash a
 
03:37:31.269 --> 03:37:31.279 align:start position:0%
with the exception of settlement
 
03:37:31.279 --> 03:37:32.469 align:start position:0%
with the exception of settlement
agreements

03:37:32.469 --> 03:37:32.479 align:start position:0%
agreements
 
03:37:35.910 --> 03:37:35.920 align:start position:0%
which shall remain subject to rsa 91
 
03:37:39.190 --> 03:37:39.200 align:start position:0%
a colon iv roman numeral six
 
03:37:41.190 --> 03:37:41.200 align:start position:0%
and comma
 
03:37:44.389 --> 03:37:44.399 align:start position:0%
after a claim has been finally resolved
 
03:37:47.510 --> 03:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
such other records the release of which
 
03:37:49.670 --> 03:37:49.680 align:start position:0%
would not constitute a violation of
 
03:37:51.670 --> 03:37:51.680 align:start position:0%
other provisions of law
 
03:37:53.750 --> 03:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
or an unwarranted invasion of a
 
03:37:55.910 --> 03:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
claimant's privacy
 
03:37:58.389 --> 03:37:58.399 align:start position:0%
so this and i think what what this is
 
03:38:00.550 --> 03:38:00.560 align:start position:0%
designed to do is
 
03:38:03.910 --> 03:38:03.920 align:start position:0%
uh in my view anyway to provide
 
03:38:08.550 --> 03:38:08.560 align:start position:0%
the maximum amount of public disclosure
 
03:38:09.590 --> 03:38:09.600 align:start position:0%
after the
 
03:38:11.830 --> 03:38:11.840 align:start position:0%
case has been settled the maximum amount
 
03:38:13.510 --> 03:38:13.520 align:start position:0%
of public disclosure
 
03:38:16.550 --> 03:38:16.560 align:start position:0%
as would be allowable under law
 
03:38:16.560 --> 03:38:17.510 align:start position:0%
as would be allowable under law
and

03:38:17.510 --> 03:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:38:19.429 --> 03:38:19.439 align:start position:0%
and balancing
 
03:38:21.190 --> 03:38:21.200 align:start position:0%
you know against the claimant's right to
 
03:38:23.510 --> 03:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
privacy so i would i would assume for
 
03:38:25.190 --> 03:38:25.200 align:start position:0%
example that
 
03:38:26.870 --> 03:38:26.880 align:start position:0%
absent really extraordinary
 
03:38:29.910 --> 03:38:29.920 align:start position:0%
circumstances a claimant's name would be
 
03:38:32.550 --> 03:38:32.560 align:start position:0%
redacted would not be released to the
 
03:38:32.560 --> 03:38:34.950 align:start position:0%
redacted would not be released to the
public

03:38:34.950 --> 03:38:34.960 align:start position:0%
public
 
03:38:37.750 --> 03:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
so if i were to talk to a layman
 
03:38:41.189 --> 03:38:41.199 align:start position:0%
constituent i i would explain this
 
03:38:43.030 --> 03:38:43.040 align:start position:0%
tell me if this is a good explanation or
 
03:38:46.790 --> 03:38:46.800 align:start position:0%
not that that what we're trying to do is
 
03:38:50.309 --> 03:38:50.319 align:start position:0%
conform as closely as we can to the 91 a
 
03:38:50.319 --> 03:38:51.590 align:start position:0%
conform as closely as we can to the 91 a
provisions

03:38:51.590 --> 03:38:51.600 align:start position:0%
provisions
 
03:38:54.870 --> 03:38:54.880 align:start position:0%
for public disclosure but that we
 
03:38:54.880 --> 03:38:56.309 align:start position:0%
for public disclosure but that we
recognize

03:38:56.309 --> 03:38:56.319 align:start position:0%
recognize
 
03:38:59.990 --> 03:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
that these cases occurred and when the
 
03:39:01.910 --> 03:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
victim was a juvenile
 
03:39:04.950 --> 03:39:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:06.630 --> 03:39:06.640 align:start position:0%
because of such a sensitive area and
 
03:39:08.790 --> 03:39:08.800 align:start position:0%
because they were a juvenile we have to
 
03:39:10.950 --> 03:39:10.960 align:start position:0%
make sure that their privacy rights are
 
03:39:13.830 --> 03:39:13.840 align:start position:0%
also protected but we are trying to
 
03:39:16.710 --> 03:39:16.720 align:start position:0%
respect 91a is is that would that be
 
03:39:18.550 --> 03:39:18.560 align:start position:0%
accurate no that that's exactly accurate
 
03:39:21.110 --> 03:39:21.120 align:start position:0%
so for example as you say because
 
03:39:22.950 --> 03:39:22.960 align:start position:0%
there's another that's why the other
 
03:39:24.550 --> 03:39:24.560 align:start position:0%
reference to other provisions of law
 
03:39:24.560 --> 03:39:25.590 align:start position:0%
reference to other provisions of law
because

03:39:25.590 --> 03:39:25.600 align:start position:0%
because
 
03:39:28.150 --> 03:39:28.160 align:start position:0%
under one under the juvenile
 
03:39:28.160 --> 03:39:29.030 align:start position:0%
under one under the juvenile
laws

03:39:29.030 --> 03:39:29.040 align:start position:0%
laws
 
03:39:31.590 --> 03:39:31.600 align:start position:0%
rsa 169b
 
03:39:34.229 --> 03:39:34.239 align:start position:0%
the records of the juvenile case are
 
03:39:37.510 --> 03:39:37.520 align:start position:0%
sealed pursuant to statute those are not
 
03:39:37.520 --> 03:39:38.950 align:start position:0%
sealed pursuant to statute those are not
available

03:39:38.950 --> 03:39:38.960 align:start position:0%
available
 
03:39:41.030 --> 03:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
pursuant to statute but there may
 
03:39:43.590 --> 03:39:43.600 align:start position:0%
presumably in a case
 
03:39:45.590 --> 03:39:45.600 align:start position:0%
you know that has been resolved there
 
03:39:48.550 --> 03:39:48.560 align:start position:0%
may be other records that would
 
03:39:51.189 --> 03:39:51.199 align:start position:0%
that would not be subject to that uh
 
03:39:54.229 --> 03:39:54.239 align:start position:0%
restriction and that would be
 
03:39:56.229 --> 03:39:56.239 align:start position:0%
uh if if not prohibited by some other
 
03:39:57.990 --> 03:39:58.000 align:start position:0%
provision of law and if doesn't if it
 
03:39:59.750 --> 03:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't uh
 
03:40:02.309 --> 03:40:02.319 align:start position:0%
uh constitute an unwarranted invasion of
 
03:40:04.630 --> 03:40:04.640 align:start position:0%
privacy then those records could be
 
03:40:06.309 --> 03:40:06.319 align:start position:0%
could be disclosed so i think i think
 
03:40:07.990 --> 03:40:08.000 align:start position:0%
you're the way you described it is
 
03:40:08.000 --> 03:40:09.510 align:start position:0%
you're the way you described it is
accurate

03:40:09.510 --> 03:40:09.520 align:start position:0%
accurate
 
03:40:11.750 --> 03:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
thank you so much chase did you look
 
03:40:13.830 --> 03:40:13.840 align:start position:0%
like you wanted to say something
 
03:40:15.910 --> 03:40:15.920 align:start position:0%
oh okay one thing that i want the
 
03:40:17.910 --> 03:40:17.920 align:start position:0%
committee to be aware of is that because
 
03:40:20.550 --> 03:40:20.560 align:start position:0%
there are two different
 
03:40:23.349 --> 03:40:23.359 align:start position:0%
sides to the coin here that there is a
 
03:40:26.229 --> 03:40:26.239 align:start position:0%
the civil process with this settlement
 
03:40:29.269 --> 03:40:29.279 align:start position:0%
bill proposed there is also a criminal
 
03:40:31.030 --> 03:40:31.040 align:start position:0%
side to this and the attorney general is
 
03:40:32.710 --> 03:40:32.720 align:start position:0%
prosecuting a bunch of the people
 
03:40:35.910 --> 03:40:35.920 align:start position:0%
involved to the extent that the the
 
03:40:35.920 --> 03:40:37.429 align:start position:0%
involved to the extent that the the
information

03:40:37.429 --> 03:40:37.439 align:start position:0%
information
 
03:40:40.469 --> 03:40:40.479 align:start position:0%
is relevant to the criminal case then it
 
03:40:43.429 --> 03:40:43.439 align:start position:0%
would be flood gates are completely open
 
03:40:45.910 --> 03:40:45.920 align:start position:0%
the cases the case law in from the
 
03:40:47.349 --> 03:40:47.359 align:start position:0%
supreme court in the united states and
 
03:40:48.710 --> 03:40:48.720 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire
 
03:40:51.510 --> 03:40:51.520 align:start position:0%
is pretty strong in terms of disclosing
 
03:40:53.830 --> 03:40:53.840 align:start position:0%
information you know the main case on
 
03:40:55.429 --> 03:40:55.439 align:start position:0%
point from the u.s supreme court
 
03:40:58.070 --> 03:40:58.080 align:start position:0%
involved a juvenile in a juvenile case
 
03:41:01.030 --> 03:41:01.040 align:start position:0%
in alaska so there is precedent for the
 
03:41:04.469 --> 03:41:04.479 align:start position:0%
un the idea that whatever happens here
 
03:41:07.030 --> 03:41:07.040 align:start position:0%
even if there is some attempt to protect
 
03:41:09.189 --> 03:41:09.199 align:start position:0%
it it's not going to stay protected
 
03:41:11.670 --> 03:41:11.680 align:start position:0%
especially if it somehow has any impact
 
03:41:13.830 --> 03:41:13.840 align:start position:0%
on the criminal case so i just want the
 
03:41:15.590 --> 03:41:15.600 align:start position:0%
committee to be aware of that in terms
 
03:41:20.870 --> 03:41:20.880 align:start position:0%
of the limitations of uh confidentiality
 
03:41:23.030 --> 03:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
so so have you seen the languages
 
03:41:25.189 --> 03:41:25.199 align:start position:0%
drafted by representative lynn are you
 
03:41:27.189 --> 03:41:27.199 align:start position:0%
have you looked at that yes and i think
 
03:41:30.389 --> 03:41:30.399 align:start position:0%
that that language is uh exactly right i
 
03:41:32.550 --> 03:41:32.560 align:start position:0%
i think that the thing that i was
 
03:41:35.110 --> 03:41:35.120 align:start position:0%
pointing out was other provisions of law
 
03:41:37.349 --> 03:41:37.359 align:start position:0%
could also include constitutional
 
03:41:39.189 --> 03:41:39.199 align:start position:0%
discovery obligations pursuant to the
 
03:41:41.830 --> 03:41:41.840 align:start position:0%
criminal case so but i'm sure judge lynn
 
03:41:44.150 --> 03:41:44.160 align:start position:0%
knew that so
 
03:41:46.389 --> 03:41:46.399 align:start position:0%
yeah i'll i'll remind him later about
 
03:41:49.189 --> 03:41:49.199 align:start position:0%
the constitutional issue
 
03:41:52.309 --> 03:41:52.319 align:start position:0%
so um mr attorney general i assume you
 
03:41:54.469 --> 03:41:54.479 align:start position:0%
also have this language in front of you
 
03:41:56.550 --> 03:41:56.560 align:start position:0%
and and what are your comments
 
03:41:58.630 --> 03:41:58.640 align:start position:0%
yeah i i think it's it's a point well
 
03:42:00.309 --> 03:42:00.319 align:start position:0%
taken that there there could be
 
03:42:02.790 --> 03:42:02.800 align:start position:0%
information that
 
03:42:04.469 --> 03:42:04.479 align:start position:0%
that is relevant to a criminal case and
 
03:42:05.910 --> 03:42:05.920 align:start position:0%
would have to be turned over to the
 
03:42:08.790 --> 03:42:08.800 align:start position:0%
defense i i do think that that still
 
03:42:10.550 --> 03:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
would provide some
 
03:42:12.550 --> 03:42:12.560 align:start position:0%
greater level of control than making it
 
03:42:15.189 --> 03:42:15.199 align:start position:0%
subject to 91a so that's that's right
 
03:42:17.429 --> 03:42:17.439 align:start position:0%
not the same as just say the concord
 
03:42:19.189 --> 03:42:19.199 align:start position:0%
monitor asking for the records and and
 
03:42:21.349 --> 03:42:21.359 align:start position:0%
getting them within five days you know
 
03:42:22.309 --> 03:42:22.319 align:start position:0%
we may have to turn it over to the
 
03:42:24.389 --> 03:42:24.399 align:start position:0%
defense it may get into the public realm
 
03:42:26.070 --> 03:42:26.080 align:start position:0%
because of that eventually but but it
 
03:42:28.150 --> 03:42:28.160 align:start position:0%
would be a more controlled at least
 
03:42:31.429 --> 03:42:31.439 align:start position:0%
orderly process i'd also just
 
03:42:32.630 --> 03:42:32.640 align:start position:0%
we should keep in mind that there will
 
03:42:34.150 --> 03:42:34.160 align:start position:0%
be a lot of folks who come through this
 
03:42:36.070 --> 03:42:36.080 align:start position:0%
process for who
 
03:42:37.830 --> 03:42:37.840 align:start position:0%
we never could have charged their cases
 
03:42:39.429 --> 03:42:39.439 align:start position:0%
because past the statute of limitations
 
03:42:41.510 --> 03:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
or we we couldn't we couldn't put
 
03:42:42.790 --> 03:42:42.800 align:start position:0%
together enough of a case to bring
 
03:42:44.229 --> 03:42:44.239 align:start position:0%
charges so
 
03:42:46.550 --> 03:42:46.560 align:start position:0%
while there will be some whose records
 
03:42:48.389 --> 03:42:48.399 align:start position:0%
might be relevant to a criminal case
 
03:42:50.229 --> 03:42:50.239 align:start position:0%
there will be many whose records will
 
03:42:53.030 --> 03:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
not be related to to a to a criminal
 
03:42:55.830 --> 03:42:55.840 align:start position:0%
case so um but but we will keep that in
 
03:42:57.750 --> 03:42:57.760 align:start position:0%
mind and that that is a factor that
 
03:43:00.070 --> 03:43:00.080 align:start position:0%
committee should be aware of so so this
 
03:43:02.550 --> 03:43:02.560 align:start position:0%
language as proposed by representative
 
03:43:02.560 --> 03:43:03.990 align:start position:0%
language as proposed by representative
lynn

03:43:03.990 --> 03:43:04.000 align:start position:0%
lynn
 
03:43:06.229 --> 03:43:06.239 align:start position:0%
yes or no you can live with this or not
 
03:43:08.070 --> 03:43:08.080 align:start position:0%
oh yes yeah representative lynn and i
 
03:43:09.590 --> 03:43:09.600 align:start position:0%
had talked about it so yes no i just
 
03:43:12.469 --> 03:43:12.479 align:start position:0%
wanted to make for the record yes okay
 
03:43:14.229 --> 03:43:14.239 align:start position:0%
and then represent umber did you have
 
03:43:14.239 --> 03:43:15.429 align:start position:0%
and then represent umber did you have
something

03:43:15.429 --> 03:43:15.439 align:start position:0%
something
 
03:43:15.439 --> 03:43:16.229 align:start position:0%
something
uh

03:43:16.229 --> 03:43:16.239 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:43:19.030 --> 03:43:19.040 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to agree that we all
 
03:43:22.630 --> 03:43:22.640 align:start position:0%
recognize that some of these
 
03:43:25.349 --> 03:43:25.359 align:start position:0%
claimants may in fact end up on the
 
03:43:27.110 --> 03:43:27.120 align:start position:0%
criminal side
 
03:43:29.750 --> 03:43:29.760 align:start position:0%
you know not not them themselves but
 
03:43:32.950 --> 03:43:32.960 align:start position:0%
their records oh right yeah could end up
 
03:43:35.030 --> 03:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
over on the criminal side
 
03:43:38.870 --> 03:43:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:41.189 --> 03:43:41.199 align:start position:0%
that's it
 
03:43:42.229 --> 03:43:42.239 align:start position:0%
so do you
 
03:43:43.750 --> 03:43:43.760 align:start position:0%
have another comment it looked like you
 
03:43:45.750 --> 03:43:45.760 align:start position:0%
might represent no no no no i was just i
 
03:43:49.030 --> 03:43:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:51.110 --> 03:43:51.120 align:start position:0%
i'm not sensing any opposition is there
 
03:43:54.389 --> 03:43:54.399 align:start position:0%
any is there any opposition to accepting
 
03:43:56.790 --> 03:43:56.800 align:start position:0%
this language as a substitute for the
 
03:43:59.750 --> 03:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
public transparency part of the bill
 
03:44:02.710 --> 03:44:02.720 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm not seeing any so represent
 
03:44:07.110 --> 03:44:07.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:09.429 --> 03:44:09.439 align:start position:0%
okay so let's do that let's let's have a
 
03:44:11.429 --> 03:44:11.439 align:start position:0%
working group include that
 
03:44:13.910 --> 03:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
the next thing up uh we're getting
 
03:44:17.030 --> 03:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
really close to being done there was an
 
03:44:20.309 --> 03:44:20.319 align:start position:0%
issue related to
 
03:44:23.269 --> 03:44:23.279 align:start position:0%
the ownership of the development of the
 
03:44:23.279 --> 03:44:24.630 align:start position:0%
the ownership of the development of the
guidelines

03:44:24.630 --> 03:44:24.640 align:start position:0%
guidelines
 
03:44:24.640 --> 03:44:25.750 align:start position:0%
guidelines
and

03:44:25.750 --> 03:44:25.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:44:28.150 --> 03:44:28.160 align:start position:0%
you know who ultimately
 
03:44:30.790 --> 03:44:30.800 align:start position:0%
um would it would how we would
 
03:44:32.150 --> 03:44:32.160 align:start position:0%
coordinate them
 
03:44:34.150 --> 03:44:34.160 align:start position:0%
how we would approve them and how they
 
03:44:36.389 --> 03:44:36.399 align:start position:0%
would be forwarded to the joint fiscal
 
03:44:36.399 --> 03:44:38.389 align:start position:0%
would be forwarded to the joint fiscal
committee

03:44:38.389 --> 03:44:38.399 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:44:39.830 --> 03:44:39.840 align:start position:0%
representative lin did you have any
 
03:44:41.510 --> 03:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
language on that part
 
03:44:44.389 --> 03:44:44.399 align:start position:0%
i did and i this is what um
 
03:44:46.389 --> 03:44:46.399 align:start position:0%
we just we had discussed this a little
 
03:44:47.990 --> 03:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
bit earlier with regard to the
 
03:44:49.590 --> 03:44:49.600 align:start position:0%
plaintiff's proposed
 
03:44:52.790 --> 03:44:52.800 align:start position:0%
language and um as i mentioned that uh
 
03:44:52.800 --> 03:44:53.750 align:start position:0%
language and um as i mentioned that uh
the

03:44:53.750 --> 03:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:44:57.349 --> 03:44:57.359 align:start position:0%
i i think that that although
 
03:45:00.710 --> 03:45:00.720 align:start position:0%
the attorney general ought to get input
 
03:45:02.070 --> 03:45:02.080 align:start position:0%
you know and give very serious
 
03:45:03.670 --> 03:45:03.680 align:start position:0%
consideration to what the claimant's
 
03:45:03.680 --> 03:45:04.550 align:start position:0%
consideration to what the claimant's
counsel

03:45:04.550 --> 03:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
counsel
 
03:45:05.670 --> 03:45:05.680 align:start position:0%
has to say
 
03:45:07.990 --> 03:45:08.000 align:start position:0%
with respect to the guidelines
 
03:45:09.269 --> 03:45:09.279 align:start position:0%
it should be
 
03:45:11.750 --> 03:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
the attorney general that has the
 
03:45:13.429 --> 03:45:13.439 align:start position:0%
ultimate authority
 
03:45:15.910 --> 03:45:15.920 align:start position:0%
to develop uh and present the guidelines
 
03:45:19.910 --> 03:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
to the joint uh fiscal committee um
 
03:45:19.920 --> 03:45:21.269 align:start position:0%
to the joint uh fiscal committee um
uh

03:45:21.269 --> 03:45:21.279 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:45:24.870 --> 03:45:24.880 align:start position:0%
and the claims process and so the the
 
03:45:28.150 --> 03:45:28.160 align:start position:0%
the change um to section four
 
03:45:29.590 --> 03:45:29.600 align:start position:0%
that that
 
03:45:31.510 --> 03:45:31.520 align:start position:0%
page number and line number please yes
 
03:45:33.429 --> 03:45:33.439 align:start position:0%
sure it's page
 
03:45:36.150 --> 03:45:36.160 align:start position:0%
three of the uh
 
03:45:37.990 --> 03:45:38.000 align:start position:0%
of amendment uh
 
03:45:43.349 --> 03:45:43.359 align:start position:0%
891 h online uh beginning on line 11
 
03:45:46.229 --> 03:45:46.239 align:start position:0%
and running to line 24.
 
03:45:47.670 --> 03:45:47.680 align:start position:0%
and and most of the changes really in
 
03:45:49.910 --> 03:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
the first the first
 
03:45:52.229 --> 03:45:52.239 align:start position:0%
line really are the first two lines so
 
03:45:54.950 --> 03:45:54.960 align:start position:0%
this would say section 4a
 
03:45:58.389 --> 03:45:58.399 align:start position:0%
as soon as practical uh following the
 
03:45:59.910 --> 03:45:59.920 align:start position:0%
effective date of this section the
 
03:46:01.590 --> 03:46:01.600 align:start position:0%
attorney general with input from
 
03:46:03.110 --> 03:46:03.120 align:start position:0%
claimants counsel
 
03:46:05.110 --> 03:46:05.120 align:start position:0%
shall develop and present to the joint
 
03:46:07.750 --> 03:46:07.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee a claims process
 
03:46:10.150 --> 03:46:10.160 align:start position:0%
consistent with this section including
 
03:46:12.630 --> 03:46:12.640 align:start position:0%
the development of claims form claim
 
03:46:15.349 --> 03:46:15.359 align:start position:0%
forms identification of
 
03:46:15.359 --> 03:46:16.150 align:start position:0%
forms identification of
uh

03:46:16.150 --> 03:46:16.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:46:19.030 --> 03:46:19.040 align:start position:0%
necessary or helpful documentation
 
03:46:21.269 --> 03:46:21.279 align:start position:0%
and guidelines for valuing claims for
 
03:46:23.429 --> 03:46:23.439 align:start position:0%
settlement purposes which take into
 
03:46:26.790 --> 03:46:26.800 align:start position:0%
account consideration of it should be of
 
03:46:30.229 --> 03:46:30.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:31.990 --> 03:46:32.000 align:start position:0%
and then from there on
 
03:46:33.830 --> 03:46:33.840 align:start position:0%
the the factors
 
03:46:33.840 --> 03:46:34.630 align:start position:0%
the the factors
are

03:46:34.630 --> 03:46:34.640 align:start position:0%
are
 
03:46:37.910 --> 03:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
uh the same as uh appear in
 
03:46:39.349 --> 03:46:39.359 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
03:46:42.710 --> 03:46:42.720 align:start position:0%
in sections one through four of the uh
 
03:46:45.110 --> 03:46:45.120 align:start position:0%
of the of the amendment you know the
 
03:46:47.590 --> 03:46:47.600 align:start position:0%
previous amendment
 
03:46:50.229 --> 03:46:50.239 align:start position:0%
so so as i understand what you're what
 
03:46:50.239 --> 03:46:51.189 align:start position:0%
so so as i understand what you're what
you're

03:46:51.189 --> 03:46:51.199 align:start position:0%
you're
 
03:46:54.950 --> 03:46:54.960 align:start position:0%
doing with this proposal is on line 11
 
03:46:57.510 --> 03:46:57.520 align:start position:0%
and line 12 it says that the claimant's
 
03:47:00.070 --> 03:47:00.080 align:start position:0%
counsel and the attorney general
 
03:47:02.389 --> 03:47:02.399 align:start position:0%
including the advocates shall develop
 
03:47:04.229 --> 03:47:04.239 align:start position:0%
and present and what you're doing is
 
03:47:05.830 --> 03:47:05.840 align:start position:0%
you're clarifying
 
03:47:05.840 --> 03:47:06.870 align:start position:0%
you're clarifying
that

03:47:06.870 --> 03:47:06.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:47:08.790 --> 03:47:08.800 align:start position:0%
the attorney general is ultimately
 
03:47:10.630 --> 03:47:10.640 align:start position:0%
responsible for what gets submitted to
 
03:47:14.870 --> 03:47:14.880 align:start position:0%
the joint fiscal committee and that
 
03:47:17.750 --> 03:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
receipt of all the appropriate input
 
03:47:20.950 --> 03:47:20.960 align:start position:0%
should should be a prerequisite to that
 
03:47:24.229 --> 03:47:24.239 align:start position:0%
so we're we're modifying kind of who who
 
03:47:26.229 --> 03:47:26.239 align:start position:0%
owns this process
 
03:47:27.990 --> 03:47:28.000 align:start position:0%
exactly it's it's it's really i mean
 
03:47:29.670 --> 03:47:29.680 align:start position:0%
subject to the fiscal committee uh
 
03:47:31.670 --> 03:47:31.680 align:start position:0%
ultimately but but it's the attorney
 
03:47:31.680 --> 03:47:32.630 align:start position:0%
ultimately but but it's the attorney
general

03:47:32.630 --> 03:47:32.640 align:start position:0%
general
 
03:47:34.309 --> 03:47:34.319 align:start position:0%
that makes the decision the
 
03:47:36.630 --> 03:47:36.640 align:start position:0%
recommendation recommendation yes uh
 
03:47:36.640 --> 03:47:37.750 align:start position:0%
recommendation recommendation yes uh
representative

03:47:37.750 --> 03:47:37.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:47:40.469 --> 03:47:40.479 align:start position:0%
yeah i certainly don't want to leave out
 
03:47:41.830 --> 03:47:41.840 align:start position:0%
the um
 
03:47:44.550 --> 03:47:44.560 align:start position:0%
victim with witness advocates
 
03:47:48.469 --> 03:47:48.479 align:start position:0%
in here because i i think they play a
 
03:47:50.630 --> 03:47:50.640 align:start position:0%
very vital role
 
03:47:52.790 --> 03:47:52.800 align:start position:0%
and so i'd like to
 
03:47:55.670 --> 03:47:55.680 align:start position:0%
have them back into this statement
 
03:47:58.229 --> 03:47:58.239 align:start position:0%
did representative lin's language delete
 
03:48:01.030 --> 03:48:01.040 align:start position:0%
the advocates no it did it did it
 
03:48:02.790 --> 03:48:02.800 align:start position:0%
but you're right i don't disagree with
 
03:48:04.150 --> 03:48:04.160 align:start position:0%
that at all i think you're right all
 
03:48:04.160 --> 03:48:06.070 align:start position:0%
that at all i think you're right all
right

03:48:06.070 --> 03:48:06.080 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:48:08.389 --> 03:48:08.399 align:start position:0%
representative walter
 
03:48:09.510 --> 03:48:09.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:48:12.070 --> 03:48:12.080 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm really concerned about the
 
03:48:14.550 --> 03:48:14.560 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee part of this having
 
03:48:17.269 --> 03:48:17.279 align:start position:0%
spent a couple of years on the physical
 
03:48:21.510 --> 03:48:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:23.670 --> 03:48:23.680 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that the expertise is there
 
03:48:24.710 --> 03:48:24.720 align:start position:0%
to really
 
03:48:26.790 --> 03:48:26.800 align:start position:0%
make um
 
03:48:26.800 --> 03:48:27.590 align:start position:0%
make um
sound

03:48:27.590 --> 03:48:27.600 align:start position:0%
sound
 
03:48:30.469 --> 03:48:30.479 align:start position:0%
decisions about this but also as i read
 
03:48:31.670 --> 03:48:31.680 align:start position:0%
this and
 
03:48:34.150 --> 03:48:34.160 align:start position:0%
judge lynn can help me read it more
 
03:48:35.590 --> 03:48:35.600 align:start position:0%
more carefully
 
03:48:35.600 --> 03:48:36.550 align:start position:0%
more carefully
um

03:48:36.550 --> 03:48:36.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:48:38.870 --> 03:48:38.880 align:start position:0%
it says that they shall be developed and
 
03:48:42.229 --> 03:48:42.239 align:start position:0%
presented to the fiscal committee
 
03:48:45.189 --> 03:48:45.199 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't say anything about
 
03:48:48.389 --> 03:48:48.399 align:start position:0%
the approval of the fiscal committee so
 
03:48:50.309 --> 03:48:50.319 align:start position:0%
is this just a
 
03:48:53.189 --> 03:48:53.199 align:start position:0%
to let us know what they are
 
03:48:55.269 --> 03:48:55.279 align:start position:0%
i would feel differently about it
 
03:48:57.269 --> 03:48:57.279 align:start position:0%
if that's what it was is just
 
03:49:00.710 --> 03:49:00.720 align:start position:0%
information to the fiscal committee
 
03:49:03.110 --> 03:49:03.120 align:start position:0%
no i think i i i mean you raise a you
 
03:49:04.870 --> 03:49:04.880 align:start position:0%
raise a very good point which would i
 
03:49:07.269 --> 03:49:07.279 align:start position:0%
mean the language should i my i
 
03:49:08.790 --> 03:49:08.800 align:start position:0%
envisioned that this would require
 
03:49:11.349 --> 03:49:11.359 align:start position:0%
approval by the fiscal committee
 
03:49:12.710 --> 03:49:12.720 align:start position:0%
but you raise a good point if the
 
03:49:14.309 --> 03:49:14.319 align:start position:0%
language doesn't say that and that needs
 
03:49:17.990 --> 03:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
to be i think it's just down on line 20.
 
03:49:19.910 --> 03:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
oh that's further down
 
03:49:21.830 --> 03:49:21.840 align:start position:0%
is it further down yeah it's further
 
03:49:23.429 --> 03:49:23.439 align:start position:0%
about that i was just reading all right
 
03:49:25.429 --> 03:49:25.439 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i was just reading the show it
 
03:49:27.910 --> 03:49:27.920 align:start position:0%
was just handed out
 
03:49:29.590 --> 03:49:29.600 align:start position:0%
okay representative
 
03:49:32.070 --> 03:49:32.080 align:start position:0%
did you have a follow-up are you no
 
03:49:34.150 --> 03:49:34.160 align:start position:0%
wait wait wait a second representative
 
03:49:35.349 --> 03:49:35.359 align:start position:0%
are you done
 
03:49:37.590 --> 03:49:37.600 align:start position:0%
well i i just am concerned about the
 
03:49:39.590 --> 03:49:39.600 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee being
 
03:49:41.349 --> 03:49:41.359 align:start position:0%
i mean most of the people a lot of the
 
03:49:43.030 --> 03:49:43.040 align:start position:0%
people in this room have served on the
 
03:49:45.269 --> 03:49:45.279 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee or at least
 
03:49:47.189 --> 03:49:47.199 align:start position:0%
watched it in action
 
03:49:47.199 --> 03:49:48.229 align:start position:0%
watched it in action
and

03:49:48.229 --> 03:49:48.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:49:51.429 --> 03:49:51.439 align:start position:0%
often there can be a lot of delays
 
03:49:53.269 --> 03:49:53.279 align:start position:0%
things get tabled
 
03:49:54.870 --> 03:49:54.880 align:start position:0%
they don't come off the table for
 
03:49:57.349 --> 03:49:57.359 align:start position:0%
several meetings
 
03:49:59.429 --> 03:49:59.439 align:start position:0%
i'm really concerned about the fiscal
 
03:49:59.439 --> 03:50:00.710 align:start position:0%
i'm really concerned about the fiscal
committee

03:50:00.710 --> 03:50:00.720 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:50:03.110 --> 03:50:03.120 align:start position:0%
ending up with the final decision here
 
03:50:03.120 --> 03:50:03.910 align:start position:0%
ending up with the final decision here
when

03:50:03.910 --> 03:50:03.920 align:start position:0%
when
 
03:50:06.710 --> 03:50:06.720 align:start position:0%
the experts in this field have put
 
03:50:06.720 --> 03:50:08.630 align:start position:0%
the experts in this field have put
together

03:50:08.630 --> 03:50:08.640 align:start position:0%
together
 
03:50:08.640 --> 03:50:09.750 align:start position:0%
together
the

03:50:09.750 --> 03:50:09.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:50:09.760 --> 03:50:11.030 align:start position:0%
the
process

03:50:11.030 --> 03:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
process
 
03:50:13.510 --> 03:50:13.520 align:start position:0%
and those are my concerns representative
 
03:50:16.630 --> 03:50:16.640 align:start position:0%
umber yeah um
 
03:50:20.870 --> 03:50:20.880 align:start position:0%
represent walnut i
 
03:50:23.510 --> 03:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
i i'm like i agree okay
 
03:50:23.520 --> 03:50:25.269 align:start position:0%
i i'm like i agree okay
but

03:50:25.269 --> 03:50:25.279 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:50:29.110 --> 03:50:29.120 align:start position:0%
what we were i think looking for was
 
03:50:33.349 --> 03:50:33.359 align:start position:0%
some sort of legislative review
 
03:50:33.359 --> 03:50:34.389 align:start position:0%
some sort of legislative review
and

03:50:34.389 --> 03:50:34.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:50:37.269 --> 03:50:37.279 align:start position:0%
i didn't want to have
 
03:50:39.590 --> 03:50:39.600 align:start position:0%
it have to go to
 
03:50:41.269 --> 03:50:41.279 align:start position:0%
a senate
 
03:50:41.279 --> 03:50:42.389 align:start position:0%
a senate
committee

03:50:42.389 --> 03:50:42.399 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:50:44.389 --> 03:50:44.399 align:start position:0%
and a house committee
 
03:50:44.399 --> 03:50:46.309 align:start position:0%
and a house committee
and

03:50:46.309 --> 03:50:46.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:50:49.269 --> 03:50:49.279 align:start position:0%
get voted on or or whatever
 
03:50:53.670 --> 03:50:53.680 align:start position:0%
so if there's some other joint committee
 
03:50:56.389 --> 03:50:56.399 align:start position:0%
that you think would be better
 
03:50:58.070 --> 03:50:58.080 align:start position:0%
i'll be more than happy to give it to
 
03:50:58.080 --> 03:50:59.030 align:start position:0%
i'll be more than happy to give it to
them

03:50:59.030 --> 03:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
them
 
03:51:01.750 --> 03:51:01.760 align:start position:0%
they may not want it that's my point
 
03:51:01.760 --> 03:51:02.469 align:start position:0%
they may not want it that's my point
but

03:51:02.469 --> 03:51:02.479 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:51:05.030 --> 03:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
i was simply looking for a way
 
03:51:06.389 --> 03:51:06.399 align:start position:0%
that we had
 
03:51:08.469 --> 03:51:08.479 align:start position:0%
both sides of the house
 
03:51:11.590 --> 03:51:11.600 align:start position:0%
to be able to take a look at it
 
03:51:11.600 --> 03:51:12.710 align:start position:0%
to be able to take a look at it
and

03:51:12.710 --> 03:51:12.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:51:15.349 --> 03:51:15.359 align:start position:0%
makes because they are going to be
 
03:51:18.150 --> 03:51:18.160 align:start position:0%
reporting back to the fiscal committee
 
03:51:20.630 --> 03:51:20.640 align:start position:0%
on how they're spending the money
 
03:51:23.349 --> 03:51:23.359 align:start position:0%
uh what the
 
03:51:25.990 --> 03:51:26.000 align:start position:0%
what the claims are you know how many
 
03:51:28.550 --> 03:51:28.560 align:start position:0%
sexual abuse how many fiscal abuse
 
03:51:31.189 --> 03:51:31.199 align:start position:0%
and that'll be coming every uh every
 
03:51:31.199 --> 03:51:32.309 align:start position:0%
and that'll be coming every uh every
quarter

03:51:32.309 --> 03:51:32.319 align:start position:0%
quarter
 
03:51:34.950 --> 03:51:34.960 align:start position:0%
so i just felt that
 
03:51:37.189 --> 03:51:37.199 align:start position:0%
it was a
 
03:51:40.229 --> 03:51:40.239 align:start position:0%
it was a better place than many all
 
03:51:41.990 --> 03:51:42.000 align:start position:0%
even though i'm
 
03:51:44.229 --> 03:51:44.239 align:start position:0%
in full agreement that if somebody else
 
03:51:47.670 --> 03:51:47.680 align:start position:0%
wants to take it let me know
 
03:51:49.750 --> 03:51:49.760 align:start position:0%
since i remember the primary principle
 
03:51:52.389 --> 03:51:52.399 align:start position:0%
we were after was that
 
03:51:56.070 --> 03:51:56.080 align:start position:0%
there should just be some legislative
 
03:51:57.830 --> 03:51:57.840 align:start position:0%
input or inclusion
 
03:52:00.070 --> 03:52:00.080 align:start position:0%
because we represent the representatives
 
03:52:02.469 --> 03:52:02.479 align:start position:0%
of the people and this entire
 
03:52:04.550 --> 03:52:04.560 align:start position:0%
program is is going to spend the
 
03:52:06.950 --> 03:52:06.960 align:start position:0%
people's money and and that there should
 
03:52:09.910 --> 03:52:09.920 align:start position:0%
be some transparency in the process so
 
03:52:10.870 --> 03:52:10.880 align:start position:0%
to me
 
03:52:13.349 --> 03:52:13.359 align:start position:0%
this this seemed to make sense as a way
 
03:52:14.950 --> 03:52:14.960 align:start position:0%
to ensure
 
03:52:17.189 --> 03:52:17.199 align:start position:0%
uh public involvement
 
03:52:21.030 --> 03:52:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:21.040 --> 03:52:21.830 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:52:21.830 --> 03:52:21.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:52:23.590 --> 03:52:23.600 align:start position:0%
so i guess the other question i would
 
03:52:26.229 --> 03:52:26.239 align:start position:0%
have and i'm sorry i wasn't on the right
 
03:52:27.830 --> 03:52:27.840 align:start position:0%
i was just reading off the piece of
 
03:52:29.670 --> 03:52:29.680 align:start position:0%
paper that was handed to us
 
03:52:32.229 --> 03:52:32.239 align:start position:0%
i guess i would wonder about
 
03:52:36.469 --> 03:52:36.479 align:start position:0%
whether it's looking for a up or down
 
03:52:38.389 --> 03:52:38.399 align:start position:0%
from the fiscal committee an approval or
 
03:52:39.990 --> 03:52:40.000 align:start position:0%
a non-approval
 
03:52:40.000 --> 03:52:40.710 align:start position:0%
a non-approval
or

03:52:40.710 --> 03:52:40.720 align:start position:0%
or
 
03:52:44.389 --> 03:52:44.399 align:start position:0%
other things that happen at physical
 
03:52:44.399 --> 03:52:45.750 align:start position:0%
other things that happen at physical
or

03:52:45.750 --> 03:52:45.760 align:start position:0%
or
 
03:52:48.229 --> 03:52:48.239 align:start position:0%
is fiscal going to be able
 
03:52:50.469 --> 03:52:50.479 align:start position:0%
to in some way
 
03:52:50.479 --> 03:52:52.790 align:start position:0%
to in some way
modify

03:52:52.790 --> 03:52:52.800 align:start position:0%
modify
 
03:52:56.630 --> 03:52:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:58.229 --> 03:52:58.239 align:start position:0%
well i don't think that's been written
 
03:53:01.110 --> 03:53:01.120 align:start position:0%
down my my my belief as i've listened to
 
03:53:03.269 --> 03:53:03.279 align:start position:0%
this and thought about this is that the
 
03:53:05.110 --> 03:53:05.120 align:start position:0%
joint fiscal committee would would take
 
03:53:07.670 --> 03:53:07.680 align:start position:0%
an up or down vote just like we do on
 
03:53:10.150 --> 03:53:10.160 align:start position:0%
every proposal presented by the uh
 
03:53:11.750 --> 03:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
executive branch
 
03:53:14.150 --> 03:53:14.160 align:start position:0%
uh and and we don't have the authority
 
03:53:17.189 --> 03:53:17.199 align:start position:0%
to do any direct modifications if we for
 
03:53:19.349 --> 03:53:19.359 align:start position:0%
some reason we wanted to table or vote
 
03:53:19.359 --> 03:53:21.030 align:start position:0%
some reason we wanted to table or vote
no

03:53:21.030 --> 03:53:21.040 align:start position:0%
no
 
03:53:23.349 --> 03:53:23.359 align:start position:0%
that would be a signal to the attorney
 
03:53:25.830 --> 03:53:25.840 align:start position:0%
general and to the public to to take
 
03:53:27.510 --> 03:53:27.520 align:start position:0%
another look at what they've presented
 
03:53:30.710 --> 03:53:30.720 align:start position:0%
us and i i don't imagine that scenario
 
03:53:32.469 --> 03:53:32.479 align:start position:0%
playing out but i do think the
 
03:53:36.150 --> 03:53:36.160 align:start position:0%
legislation should anticipate you know
 
03:53:38.630 --> 03:53:38.640 align:start position:0%
how we would handle that i i would be in
 
03:53:40.950 --> 03:53:40.960 align:start position:0%
favor of a yes or no as opposed to
 
03:53:43.189 --> 03:53:43.199 align:start position:0%
making this an item of information but
 
03:53:45.750 --> 03:53:45.760 align:start position:0%
that's that's just my position
 
03:53:51.429 --> 03:53:51.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:52.790 --> 03:53:52.800 align:start position:0%
it does say
 
03:53:55.110 --> 03:53:55.120 align:start position:0%
if the joint fiscal committee votes to
 
03:53:55.120 --> 03:53:56.309 align:start position:0%
if the joint fiscal committee votes to
object

03:53:56.309 --> 03:53:56.319 align:start position:0%
object
 
03:53:58.550 --> 03:53:58.560 align:start position:0%
to the proposed claims process and
 
03:53:58.560 --> 03:53:59.910 align:start position:0%
to the proposed claims process and
guidelines

03:53:59.910 --> 03:53:59.920 align:start position:0%
guidelines
 
03:54:02.150 --> 03:54:02.160 align:start position:0%
the fiscal committee shall articulate
 
03:54:04.710 --> 03:54:04.720 align:start position:0%
its reasons for objections
 
03:54:05.990 --> 03:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
in writing
 
03:54:07.990 --> 03:54:08.000 align:start position:0%
and the claimants counsel
 
03:54:09.750 --> 03:54:09.760 align:start position:0%
and the attorney general shall present
 
03:54:09.760 --> 03:54:12.070 align:start position:0%
and the attorney general shall present
approval

03:54:12.070 --> 03:54:12.080 align:start position:0%
approval
 
03:54:16.309 --> 03:54:16.319 align:start position:0%
for approval of revised version
 
03:54:19.670 --> 03:54:19.680 align:start position:0%
so i mean it it basically says that the
 
03:54:21.590 --> 03:54:21.600 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee can reject it i can't
 
03:54:23.510 --> 03:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
imagine why
 
03:54:25.189 --> 03:54:25.199 align:start position:0%
but um
 
03:54:27.990 --> 03:54:28.000 align:start position:0%
it can be rejected
 
03:54:29.830 --> 03:54:29.840 align:start position:0%
i you know i i mean
 
03:54:31.189 --> 03:54:31.199 align:start position:0%
i don't care
 
03:54:33.030 --> 03:54:33.040 align:start position:0%
i just i just
 
03:54:36.229 --> 03:54:36.239 align:start position:0%
didn't want it to get bogged down
 
03:54:38.710 --> 03:54:38.720 align:start position:0%
some other place it's what i'm what i'm
 
03:54:41.750 --> 03:54:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:44.150 --> 03:54:44.160 align:start position:0%
representative owen do you know okay and
 
03:54:47.429 --> 03:54:47.439 align:start position:0%
so the joint fiscal committee at least
 
03:54:49.510 --> 03:54:49.520 align:start position:0%
is logical in the sense that it's
 
03:54:51.349 --> 03:54:51.359 align:start position:0%
efficient because it has the senate and
 
03:54:53.750 --> 03:54:53.760 align:start position:0%
the house both participating
 
03:54:56.469 --> 03:54:56.479 align:start position:0%
and uh and it is it does have a
 
03:54:58.710 --> 03:54:58.720 align:start position:0%
financial implication
 
03:55:00.550 --> 03:55:00.560 align:start position:0%
although the details are legal and
 
03:55:03.429 --> 03:55:03.439 align:start position:0%
beyond us uh i agree with that point
 
03:55:04.630 --> 03:55:04.640 align:start position:0%
i do have one
 
03:55:06.710 --> 03:55:06.720 align:start position:0%
uh representative hatch yeah thank you
 
03:55:09.510 --> 03:55:09.520 align:start position:0%
mr chair i'm just thinking um we've
 
03:55:11.750 --> 03:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
given a lot of authority on the
 
03:55:13.750 --> 03:55:13.760 align:start position:0%
front end of all this in a lot of
 
03:55:16.309 --> 03:55:16.319 align:start position:0%
control within the attorney general and
 
03:55:17.670 --> 03:55:17.680 align:start position:0%
and i'm sure
 
03:55:19.670 --> 03:55:19.680 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry appropriately so
 
03:55:19.680 --> 03:55:20.550 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry appropriately so
um

03:55:20.550 --> 03:55:20.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:55:22.950 --> 03:55:22.960 align:start position:0%
and so it goes to the fiscal committee
 
03:55:24.070 --> 03:55:24.080 align:start position:0%
and as
 
03:55:26.309 --> 03:55:26.319 align:start position:0%
uh representative walner pointed out
 
03:55:27.670 --> 03:55:27.680 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of things that can happen
 
03:55:27.680 --> 03:55:28.389 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of things that can happen
there

03:55:28.389 --> 03:55:28.399 align:start position:0%
there
 
03:55:31.990 --> 03:55:32.000 align:start position:0%
and not all of them necessarily
 
03:55:34.070 --> 03:55:34.080 align:start position:0%
to add to the flow of what we're trying
 
03:55:35.590 --> 03:55:35.600 align:start position:0%
to accomplish here
 
03:55:35.600 --> 03:55:37.189 align:start position:0%
to accomplish here
so

03:55:37.189 --> 03:55:37.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:55:39.429 --> 03:55:39.439 align:start position:0%
why would it be out of order i guess in
 
03:55:41.670 --> 03:55:41.680 align:start position:0%
the context of it goes to the fiscal
 
03:55:44.550 --> 03:55:44.560 align:start position:0%
committee they can have a vote and in
 
03:55:47.110 --> 03:55:47.120 align:start position:0%
case of a negative vote is there a
 
03:55:48.710 --> 03:55:48.720 align:start position:0%
mechanism for
 
03:55:48.720 --> 03:55:49.670 align:start position:0%
mechanism for
the

03:55:49.670 --> 03:55:49.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:55:49.680 --> 03:55:51.510 align:start position:0%
the
actors

03:55:51.510 --> 03:55:51.520 align:start position:0%
actors
 
03:55:53.590 --> 03:55:53.600 align:start position:0%
that had made the settlement to go
 
03:55:56.070 --> 03:55:56.080 align:start position:0%
forward if that negative vote is not
 
03:55:58.550 --> 03:55:58.560 align:start position:0%
within a certain period of time or
 
03:56:00.950 --> 03:56:00.960 align:start position:0%
are not clear enough um
 
03:56:03.510 --> 03:56:03.520 align:start position:0%
and and i i haven't had time to think of
 
03:56:05.429 --> 03:56:05.439 align:start position:0%
this through so much but in the terms of
 
03:56:08.710 --> 03:56:08.720 align:start position:0%
gelcard joint legislative committee
 
03:56:10.710 --> 03:56:10.720 align:start position:0%
a department can go forward with some of
 
03:56:13.189 --> 03:56:13.199 align:start position:0%
the rules even though um under the
 
03:56:15.269 --> 03:56:15.279 align:start position:0%
objection of
 
03:56:18.150 --> 03:56:18.160 align:start position:0%
gel card and there is a mechanism for
 
03:56:20.309 --> 03:56:20.319 align:start position:0%
that to be clawed back i mean i don't
 
03:56:21.349 --> 03:56:21.359 align:start position:0%
know i just
 
03:56:23.429 --> 03:56:23.439 align:start position:0%
maybe i'm complicating things but no no
 
03:56:27.510 --> 03:56:27.520 align:start position:0%
it's it's all good thought um i i
 
03:56:29.830 --> 03:56:29.840 align:start position:0%
i it seems to me like it wouldn't take
 
03:56:31.590 --> 03:56:31.600 align:start position:0%
long to get this on the fiscal
 
03:56:33.990 --> 03:56:34.000 align:start position:0%
committee's calendar because the fiscal
 
03:56:36.710 --> 03:56:36.720 align:start position:0%
committee meets so regularly
 
03:56:40.870 --> 03:56:40.880 align:start position:0%
so i don't i don't imagine a a big delay
 
03:56:42.710 --> 03:56:42.720 align:start position:0%
uh in terms of
 
03:56:46.630 --> 03:56:46.640 align:start position:0%
uh having the settlements take place
 
03:56:49.670 --> 03:56:49.680 align:start position:0%
without an approved set of guidelines i
 
03:56:49.680 --> 03:56:50.389 align:start position:0%
without an approved set of guidelines i
think

03:56:50.389 --> 03:56:50.399 align:start position:0%
think
 
03:56:52.150 --> 03:56:52.160 align:start position:0%
that would defeat the purpose of the
 
03:56:55.189 --> 03:56:55.199 align:start position:0%
review i mean if if i mean as assuming
 
03:56:56.870 --> 03:56:56.880 align:start position:0%
that the joint fiscal committee is
 
03:56:58.870 --> 03:56:58.880 align:start position:0%
competent and is actually truly a
 
03:57:00.870 --> 03:57:00.880 align:start position:0%
representative of the public
 
03:57:00.880 --> 03:57:01.750 align:start position:0%
representative of the public
then

03:57:01.750 --> 03:57:01.760 align:start position:0%
then
 
03:57:01.760 --> 03:57:03.910 align:start position:0%
then
um

03:57:03.910 --> 03:57:03.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:57:06.950 --> 03:57:06.960 align:start position:0%
it's okay to me if the public's
 
03:57:09.429 --> 03:57:09.439 align:start position:0%
representative says time out we've got
 
03:57:11.830 --> 03:57:11.840 align:start position:0%
an issue with this i don't imagine that
 
03:57:14.630 --> 03:57:14.640 align:start position:0%
happening but it it it could
 
03:57:16.550 --> 03:57:16.560 align:start position:0%
and but i don't think that scenario is
 
03:57:22.630 --> 03:57:22.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:25.349 --> 03:57:25.359 align:start position:0%
you have commented that or
 
03:57:26.550 --> 03:57:26.560 align:start position:0%
because it looks like you're thinking
 
03:57:29.189 --> 03:57:29.199 align:start position:0%
there you got your thinking mask on i am
 
03:57:30.950 --> 03:57:30.960 align:start position:0%
and along with what the attorney general
 
03:57:33.269 --> 03:57:33.279 align:start position:0%
wanted to accomplish initially is as he
 
03:57:35.349 --> 03:57:35.359 align:start position:0%
wanted separation in
 
03:57:37.189 --> 03:57:37.199 align:start position:0%
or somebody wanted to
 
03:57:39.910 --> 03:57:39.920 align:start position:0%
be assured that the complainants
 
03:57:41.750 --> 03:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
understand that this
 
03:57:44.309 --> 03:57:44.319 align:start position:0%
is not a state
 
03:57:47.189 --> 03:57:47.199 align:start position:0%
per se oversight and the system isn't
 
03:57:48.870 --> 03:57:48.880 align:start position:0%
rigged against them so to speak and if
 
03:57:50.309 --> 03:57:50.319 align:start position:0%
you're bringing it back around to that
 
03:57:51.510 --> 03:57:51.520 align:start position:0%
same body
 
03:57:51.520 --> 03:57:52.630 align:start position:0%
same body
um

03:57:52.630 --> 03:57:52.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:57:53.910 --> 03:57:53.920 align:start position:0%
i don't know what the
 
03:57:56.070 --> 03:57:56.080 align:start position:0%
the look is but any i'll have to think
 
03:57:57.349 --> 03:57:57.359 align:start position:0%
on it i'm sorry
 
03:57:59.189 --> 03:57:59.199 align:start position:0%
again i think that's a fair thought it's
 
03:58:01.030 --> 03:58:01.040 align:start position:0%
a good thought because you're trying to
 
03:58:02.710 --> 03:58:02.720 align:start position:0%
make sure that people have confidence in
 
03:58:04.309 --> 03:58:04.319 align:start position:0%
the system but i imagine these
 
03:58:06.790 --> 03:58:06.800 align:start position:0%
guidelines need to be developed before
 
03:58:09.590 --> 03:58:09.600 align:start position:0%
we unleash the settlement process on the
 
03:58:10.870 --> 03:58:10.880 align:start position:0%
public and so
 
03:58:12.790 --> 03:58:12.800 align:start position:0%
there isn't there there won't be an
 
03:58:14.870 --> 03:58:14.880 align:start position:0%
issue i don't think and i'll let the
 
03:58:18.309 --> 03:58:18.319 align:start position:0%
attorneys general correct me i i don't
 
03:58:19.990 --> 03:58:20.000 align:start position:0%
think there will be an issue
 
03:58:22.790 --> 03:58:22.800 align:start position:0%
of getting people all ginned up to start
 
03:58:24.870 --> 03:58:24.880 align:start position:0%
working the process until after the
 
03:58:29.429 --> 03:58:29.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:31.349 --> 03:58:31.359 align:start position:0%
yeah i i would agree with that because i
 
03:58:31.359 --> 03:58:32.630 align:start position:0%
yeah i i would agree with that because i
think

03:58:32.630 --> 03:58:32.640 align:start position:0%
think
 
03:58:33.830 --> 03:58:33.840 align:start position:0%
claimants are going to want to see what
 
03:58:35.189 --> 03:58:35.199 align:start position:0%
the guidelines look like before they
 
03:58:38.309 --> 03:58:38.319 align:start position:0%
decide to even embark on the process so
 
03:58:39.990 --> 03:58:40.000 align:start position:0%
not that they won't want to see us move
 
03:58:42.229 --> 03:58:42.239 align:start position:0%
quickly which we will do but but i i
 
03:58:43.510 --> 03:58:43.520 align:start position:0%
would agree that there won't there would
 
03:58:45.110 --> 03:58:45.120 align:start position:0%
not be a push to kind of move forward
 
03:58:48.229 --> 03:58:48.239 align:start position:0%
without guidelines
 
03:58:50.229 --> 03:58:50.239 align:start position:0%
okay so because we still have plaintiffs
 
03:58:53.269 --> 03:58:53.279 align:start position:0%
counsel in the room uh what what we've
 
03:58:53.279 --> 03:58:54.150 align:start position:0%
counsel in the room uh what what we've
done

03:58:54.150 --> 03:58:54.160 align:start position:0%
done
 
03:58:56.309 --> 03:58:56.319 align:start position:0%
if we if we go forward with this is all
 
03:58:57.429 --> 03:58:57.439 align:start position:0%
we've done
 
03:58:59.030 --> 03:58:59.040 align:start position:0%
is we've shifted
 
03:58:59.040 --> 03:58:59.790 align:start position:0%
is we've shifted
the

03:58:59.790 --> 03:58:59.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:58:59.800 --> 03:59:01.670 align:start position:0%
the
co-responsibility

03:59:01.670 --> 03:59:01.680 align:start position:0%
co-responsibility
 
03:59:01.680 --> 03:59:02.790 align:start position:0%
co-responsibility
between

03:59:02.790 --> 03:59:02.800 align:start position:0%
between
 
03:59:05.189 --> 03:59:05.199 align:start position:0%
the the the public and the attorneys
 
03:59:05.199 --> 03:59:06.630 align:start position:0%
the the the public and the attorneys
general

03:59:06.630 --> 03:59:06.640 align:start position:0%
general
 
03:59:08.469 --> 03:59:08.479 align:start position:0%
before this goes to joint committee
 
03:59:10.229 --> 03:59:10.239 align:start position:0%
we've changed that from being like
 
03:59:10.239 --> 03:59:11.510 align:start position:0%
we've changed that from being like
co-equal

03:59:11.510 --> 03:59:11.520 align:start position:0%
co-equal
 
03:59:13.269 --> 03:59:13.279 align:start position:0%
to making sure
 
03:59:15.510 --> 03:59:15.520 align:start position:0%
that there's sort of a unity of command
 
03:59:17.269 --> 03:59:17.279 align:start position:0%
principle in place here that there's
 
03:59:17.279 --> 03:59:18.229 align:start position:0%
principle in place here that there's
actually

03:59:18.229 --> 03:59:18.239 align:start position:0%
actually
 
03:59:20.070 --> 03:59:20.080 align:start position:0%
somebody accountable for delivering
 
03:59:21.830 --> 03:59:21.840 align:start position:0%
something to the fiscal committee when
 
03:59:23.910 --> 03:59:23.920 align:start position:0%
everyone's responsible nobody's
 
03:59:26.150 --> 03:59:26.160 align:start position:0%
responsible so this this clarifies
 
03:59:28.550 --> 03:59:28.560 align:start position:0%
responsibility do you do you have
 
03:59:30.469 --> 03:59:30.479 align:start position:0%
concerns about that
 
03:59:30.479 --> 03:59:31.590 align:start position:0%
concerns about that
yes

03:59:31.590 --> 03:59:31.600 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:59:33.269 --> 03:59:33.279 align:start position:0%
so the the one thing that i would point
 
03:59:36.229 --> 03:59:36.239 align:start position:0%
out is that this is an unusual uh legal
 
03:59:36.239 --> 03:59:37.349 align:start position:0%
out is that this is an unusual uh legal
creature

03:59:37.349 --> 03:59:37.359 align:start position:0%
creature
 
03:59:39.670 --> 03:59:39.680 align:start position:0%
most of the cases that involve mass tort
 
03:59:39.680 --> 03:59:40.950 align:start position:0%
most of the cases that involve mass tort
litigation

03:59:40.950 --> 03:59:40.960 align:start position:0%
litigation
 
03:59:44.150 --> 03:59:44.160 align:start position:0%
are agreements between the parties and
 
03:59:46.870 --> 03:59:46.880 align:start position:0%
usually it occurs after what are called
 
03:59:49.590 --> 03:59:49.600 align:start position:0%
bell weather trials so for example i had
 
03:59:52.389 --> 03:59:52.399 align:start position:0%
a case with my client had a vaginal mesh
 
03:59:54.150 --> 03:59:54.160 align:start position:0%
issue there was a multi-district
 
03:59:55.990 --> 03:59:56.000 align:start position:0%
litigation going on in the vaginal mesh
 
03:59:58.790 --> 03:59:58.800 align:start position:0%
cases and they had bellwether trials and
 
04:00:00.150 --> 04:00:00.160 align:start position:0%
it was the
 
04:00:01.990 --> 04:00:02.000 align:start position:0%
leverage that was granted to the
 
04:00:04.710 --> 04:00:04.720 align:start position:0%
plaintiff's parties that helped them
 
04:00:07.110 --> 04:00:07.120 align:start position:0%
craft the what are called the damage
 
04:00:09.750 --> 04:00:09.760 align:start position:0%
matrix this is what we're talking about
 
04:00:09.760 --> 04:00:10.630 align:start position:0%
matrix this is what we're talking about
so

04:00:10.630 --> 04:00:10.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:00:13.510 --> 04:00:13.520 align:start position:0%
this is the entire thing if this does
 
04:00:16.710 --> 04:00:16.720 align:start position:0%
not work for the the plaintiffs then the
 
04:00:19.349 --> 04:00:19.359 align:start position:0%
system won't work and so one thing that
 
04:00:21.510 --> 04:00:21.520 align:start position:0%
i i thought of in listening to the
 
04:00:23.349 --> 04:00:23.359 align:start position:0%
debate here is that
 
04:00:26.630 --> 04:00:26.640 align:start position:0%
without some obligation that the the
 
04:00:28.150 --> 04:00:28.160 align:start position:0%
plaintiff's counsel and the attorney
 
04:00:30.150 --> 04:00:30.160 align:start position:0%
general are in agreement
 
04:00:30.160 --> 04:00:30.950 align:start position:0%
general are in agreement
then

04:00:30.950 --> 04:00:30.960 align:start position:0%
then
 
04:00:33.510 --> 04:00:33.520 align:start position:0%
the there's a real threat to the entire
 
04:00:33.520 --> 04:00:34.389 align:start position:0%
the there's a real threat to the entire
bill

04:00:34.389 --> 04:00:34.399 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:00:36.870 --> 04:00:36.880 align:start position:0%
as a system of resolving these claims
 
04:00:39.269 --> 04:00:39.279 align:start position:0%
and again it goes back to the fact that
 
04:00:42.469 --> 04:00:42.479 align:start position:0%
this is a statutory beast as opposed to
 
04:00:45.269 --> 04:00:45.279 align:start position:0%
the settlement of multiple claims after
 
04:00:47.830 --> 04:00:47.840 align:start position:0%
a trial in court the
 
04:00:50.550 --> 04:00:50.560 align:start position:0%
the leverage that's there to get the
 
04:00:52.870 --> 04:00:52.880 align:start position:0%
parties to negotiate in
 
04:00:55.030 --> 04:00:55.040 align:start position:0%
in at you know somewhat equal grounds is
 
04:00:58.469 --> 04:00:58.479 align:start position:0%
gone because of the way that either
 
04:01:00.790 --> 04:01:00.800 align:start position:0%
representative lin's amendment or the
 
04:01:03.429 --> 04:01:03.439 align:start position:0%
bill itself as it's currently proposed
 
04:01:05.990 --> 04:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
the leverage is not there to to make
 
04:01:07.429 --> 04:01:07.439 align:start position:0%
sure or
 
04:01:10.150 --> 04:01:10.160 align:start position:0%
to help incentivize the two sides to
 
04:01:12.790 --> 04:01:12.800 align:start position:0%
come together um so for example if
 
04:01:14.469 --> 04:01:14.479 align:start position:0%
instead of
 
04:01:14.479 --> 04:01:15.670 align:start position:0%
instead of
representative

04:01:15.670 --> 04:01:15.680 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:01:17.830 --> 04:01:17.840 align:start position:0%
yeah instead of in representative lin's
 
04:01:19.670 --> 04:01:19.680 align:start position:0%
language as soon as practical the
 
04:01:21.750 --> 04:01:21.760 align:start position:0%
following effective date of the section
 
04:01:24.070 --> 04:01:24.080 align:start position:0%
the attorney general and and strikeout
 
04:01:27.030 --> 04:01:27.040 align:start position:0%
with input from in agreement with the
 
04:01:29.429 --> 04:01:29.439 align:start position:0%
claimant's counsel i think that means
 
04:01:30.710 --> 04:01:30.720 align:start position:0%
that their
 
04:01:32.950 --> 04:01:32.960 align:start position:0%
the statute would create
 
04:01:35.030 --> 04:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
some of the leverage that
 
04:01:36.550 --> 04:01:36.560 align:start position:0%
exists in these multi-district
 
04:01:39.229 --> 04:01:39.239 align:start position:0%
litigation cases out in the you know
 
04:01:39.239 --> 04:01:40.790 align:start position:0%
litigation cases out in the you know
non-statutory

04:01:40.790 --> 04:01:40.800 align:start position:0%
non-statutory
 
04:01:40.800 --> 04:01:42.070 align:start position:0%
non-statutory
universe

04:01:42.070 --> 04:01:42.080 align:start position:0%
universe
 
04:01:42.080 --> 04:01:43.670 align:start position:0%
universe
otherwise

04:01:43.670 --> 04:01:43.680 align:start position:0%
otherwise
 
04:01:45.510 --> 04:01:45.520 align:start position:0%
there is a i mean this is the damage
 
04:01:48.550 --> 04:01:48.560 align:start position:0%
matrix be clear is the whole thing if
 
04:01:51.030 --> 04:01:51.040 align:start position:0%
the damage matrix is not done correctly
 
04:01:53.990 --> 04:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
then it the the incentive
 
04:01:56.790 --> 04:01:56.800 align:start position:0%
process or the incentive of the entire
 
04:02:00.710 --> 04:02:00.720 align:start position:0%
uh settlement bill falls away
 
04:02:03.750 --> 04:02:03.760 align:start position:0%
mr chair if i may i usually do this
 
04:02:05.910 --> 04:02:05.920 align:start position:0%
to myself with myself my own brain every
 
04:02:08.150 --> 04:02:08.160 align:start position:0%
time after i talk to tony what tony's
 
04:02:09.910 --> 04:02:09.920 align:start position:0%
referencing just to be clear i have to
 
04:02:11.830 --> 04:02:11.840 align:start position:0%
dumb it down for myself
 
04:02:14.710 --> 04:02:14.720 align:start position:0%
the guidelines is the damage matrix and
 
04:02:17.429 --> 04:02:17.439 align:start position:0%
while this is not a new phenomenon like
 
04:02:19.349 --> 04:02:19.359 align:start position:0%
mass torts multi-district litigation
 
04:02:21.750 --> 04:02:21.760 align:start position:0%
these mass tort settlement funds happen
 
04:02:23.349 --> 04:02:23.359 align:start position:0%
all over the country in all different
 
04:02:25.830 --> 04:02:25.840 align:start position:0%
kinds of contexts in our research we
 
04:02:28.950 --> 04:02:28.960 align:start position:0%
were only able to find one statutorily
 
04:02:30.870 --> 04:02:30.880 align:start position:0%
instituted compensation fund and that
 
04:02:33.189 --> 04:02:33.199 align:start position:0%
was the 911 victims compensation fund
 
04:02:34.950 --> 04:02:34.960 align:start position:0%
which was an act of congress that was on
 
04:02:36.630 --> 04:02:36.640 align:start position:0%
the federal level so no state has done
 
04:02:38.550 --> 04:02:38.560 align:start position:0%
this before i just wanted to give that
 
04:02:45.269 --> 04:02:45.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:47.030 --> 04:02:47.040 align:start position:0%
oh yeah yeah you know you know i i
 
04:02:49.349 --> 04:02:49.359 align:start position:0%
appreciate what attorney skelombrini and
 
04:02:51.830 --> 04:02:51.840 align:start position:0%
uh and and counsel for the uh
 
04:02:53.990 --> 04:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
association for justice have said but
 
04:02:56.389 --> 04:02:56.399 align:start position:0%
i i do think that this
 
04:02:56.399 --> 04:02:57.590 align:start position:0%
i i do think that this
that

04:02:57.590 --> 04:02:57.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:02:59.590 --> 04:02:59.600 align:start position:0%
the attorney general should retain this
 
04:03:01.990 --> 04:03:02.000 align:start position:0%
authority to have to make the
 
04:03:05.510 --> 04:03:05.520 align:start position:0%
the final decision to to us because
 
04:03:05.520 --> 04:03:06.469 align:start position:0%
the final decision to to us because
the

04:03:06.469 --> 04:03:06.479 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:03:08.469 --> 04:03:08.479 align:start position:0%
the attorney i mean
 
04:03:10.550 --> 04:03:10.560 align:start position:0%
presumably the attorney general has not
 
04:03:12.550 --> 04:03:12.560 align:start position:0%
gone through all this process to come up
 
04:03:14.309 --> 04:03:14.319 align:start position:0%
with a you know a
 
04:03:17.510 --> 04:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
a matrix of of uh guidelines that are
 
04:03:18.469 --> 04:03:18.479 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
04:03:20.150 --> 04:03:20.160 align:start position:0%
that are you know are not going to be
 
04:03:21.750 --> 04:03:21.760 align:start position:0%
receptive to
 
04:03:23.510 --> 04:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
uh to
 
04:03:25.670 --> 04:03:25.680 align:start position:0%
claim its council there were no reason
 
04:03:27.510 --> 04:03:27.520 align:start position:0%
no no reason for him to do that and it
 
04:03:29.990 --> 04:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
would just be forcing people into the
 
04:03:32.790 --> 04:03:32.800 align:start position:0%
to go into court and so i i i don't see
 
04:03:35.670 --> 04:03:35.680 align:start position:0%
that happening i do see however if it's
 
04:03:38.870 --> 04:03:38.880 align:start position:0%
if if the requirement is agreement
 
04:03:40.790 --> 04:03:40.800 align:start position:0%
then you're going to be back to that
 
04:03:43.590 --> 04:03:43.600 align:start position:0%
situation of you know of needing to have
 
04:03:43.600 --> 04:03:44.870 align:start position:0%
situation of you know of needing to have
another

04:03:44.870 --> 04:03:44.880 align:start position:0%
another
 
04:03:47.110 --> 04:03:47.120 align:start position:0%
administrator or another adjudicator to
 
04:03:49.030 --> 04:03:49.040 align:start position:0%
this uh because if they don't if they
 
04:03:50.070 --> 04:03:50.080 align:start position:0%
don't agree
 
04:03:52.710 --> 04:03:52.720 align:start position:0%
so i i just think it that it it's much
 
04:03:54.790 --> 04:03:54.800 align:start position:0%
better to leave this in the hands of the
 
04:03:57.110 --> 04:03:57.120 align:start position:0%
attorney general he's a public figure i
 
04:03:58.309 --> 04:03:58.319 align:start position:0%
think we can
 
04:04:01.510 --> 04:04:01.520 align:start position:0%
i think we can rely on him doing
 
04:04:03.670 --> 04:04:03.680 align:start position:0%
his uh doing a good a good job that's
 
04:04:05.750 --> 04:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
fair to both sides
 
04:04:09.670 --> 04:04:09.680 align:start position:0%
i i i appreciate those comments um
 
04:04:12.389 --> 04:04:12.399 align:start position:0%
mr dean mr hayden did you did you want
 
04:04:15.269 --> 04:04:15.279 align:start position:0%
to chime in on this because i'm getting
 
04:04:17.030 --> 04:04:17.040 align:start position:0%
ready to do a straw vote i just want to
 
04:04:20.309 --> 04:04:20.319 align:start position:0%
make sure you're heard
 
04:04:21.990 --> 04:04:22.000 align:start position:0%
thank you all
 
04:04:31.990 --> 04:04:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:33.269 --> 04:04:33.279 align:start position:0%
i would
 
04:04:35.349 --> 04:04:35.359 align:start position:0%
just like to add i mean the last
 
04:04:37.030 --> 04:04:37.040 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meeting
 
04:04:39.189 --> 04:04:39.199 align:start position:0%
there was a discussion in
 
04:04:40.550 --> 04:04:40.560 align:start position:0%
by dave
 
04:04:43.110 --> 04:04:43.120 align:start position:0%
visananza who's actually been through
 
04:04:45.110 --> 04:04:45.120 align:start position:0%
this process
 
04:04:46.870 --> 04:04:46.880 align:start position:0%
a number of times
 
04:04:48.469 --> 04:04:48.479 align:start position:0%
on the defense side
 
04:04:50.150 --> 04:04:50.160 align:start position:0%
and you know what dave
 
04:04:51.750 --> 04:04:51.760 align:start position:0%
says this time and time again is this
 
04:04:51.760 --> 04:04:52.710 align:start position:0%
says this time and time again is this
whole

04:04:52.710 --> 04:04:52.720 align:start position:0%
whole
 
04:04:52.720 --> 04:04:53.429 align:start position:0%
whole
um

04:04:53.429 --> 04:04:53.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:04:55.189 --> 04:04:55.199 align:start position:0%
determination of the guidelines is a
 
04:04:56.950 --> 04:04:56.960 align:start position:0%
very it's a it's a brutal process
 
04:04:58.950 --> 04:04:58.960 align:start position:0%
because you both sides really need to
 
04:05:02.070 --> 04:05:02.080 align:start position:0%
confront very difficult facts and
 
04:05:04.790 --> 04:05:04.800 align:start position:0%
circumstances and trying to try to work
 
04:05:06.070 --> 04:05:06.080 align:start position:0%
through them
 
04:05:07.349 --> 04:05:07.359 align:start position:0%
i would say
 
04:05:10.469 --> 04:05:10.479 align:start position:0%
you know i offered that mediator
 
04:05:12.710 --> 04:05:12.720 align:start position:0%
earlier as a way of sort of helping the
 
04:05:15.349 --> 04:05:15.359 align:start position:0%
attorney general and and us get through
 
04:05:17.750 --> 04:05:17.760 align:start position:0%
the process if it was needed and i would
 
04:05:17.760 --> 04:05:18.469 align:start position:0%
the process if it was needed and i would
say

04:05:18.469 --> 04:05:18.479 align:start position:0%
say
 
04:05:21.349 --> 04:05:21.359 align:start position:0%
if this amendment is used
 
04:05:24.150 --> 04:05:24.160 align:start position:0%
um you know you're really taking out the
 
04:05:25.670 --> 04:05:25.680 align:start position:0%
you're turning it into a one-sided
 
04:05:28.070 --> 04:05:28.080 align:start position:0%
process and and i don't see how this
 
04:05:30.790 --> 04:05:30.800 align:start position:0%
will help the process of getting to
 
04:05:30.800 --> 04:05:32.150 align:start position:0%
will help the process of getting to
acclaim's

04:05:32.150 --> 04:05:32.160 align:start position:0%
acclaim's
 
04:05:34.389 --> 04:05:34.399 align:start position:0%
guidelines at all
 
04:05:34.399 --> 04:05:38.229 align:start position:0%
guidelines at all
so

04:05:38.229 --> 04:05:38.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:40.630 --> 04:05:40.640 align:start position:0%
so mr dean do you want to
 
04:05:43.030 --> 04:05:43.040 align:start position:0%
add or amplify or
 
04:05:46.469 --> 04:05:46.479 align:start position:0%
argue maybe you could disagree with him
 
04:05:48.469 --> 04:05:48.479 align:start position:0%
no i no i agree with him and
 
04:05:48.479 --> 04:05:49.349 align:start position:0%
no i no i agree with him and
um

04:05:49.349 --> 04:05:49.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:05:51.349 --> 04:05:51.359 align:start position:0%
i agree with the comment comments
 
04:05:55.110 --> 04:05:55.120 align:start position:0%
previously as well um you know we um
 
04:05:56.870 --> 04:05:56.880 align:start position:0%
i think it's been a common theme we've
 
04:05:59.349 --> 04:05:59.359 align:start position:0%
we've said throughout um and dave has
 
04:06:01.510 --> 04:06:01.520 align:start position:0%
said many times that this is all about
 
04:06:02.950 --> 04:06:02.960 align:start position:0%
trust and
 
04:06:04.469 --> 04:06:04.479 align:start position:0%
um this
 
04:06:06.229 --> 04:06:06.239 align:start position:0%
would clearly be
 
04:06:06.239 --> 04:06:07.910 align:start position:0%
would clearly be
um

04:06:07.910 --> 04:06:07.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:06:10.950 --> 04:06:10.960 align:start position:0%
a difficult hurdle uh for for us in
 
04:06:12.950 --> 04:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
talking to our clients uh and giving
 
04:06:16.550 --> 04:06:16.560 align:start position:0%
them trust in going into the system um
 
04:06:18.469 --> 04:06:18.479 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:06:21.429 --> 04:06:21.439 align:start position:0%
i i feel like if they know their counsel
 
04:06:21.439 --> 04:06:22.630 align:start position:0%
i i feel like if they know their counsel
are

04:06:22.630 --> 04:06:22.640 align:start position:0%
are
 
04:06:24.150 --> 04:06:24.160 align:start position:0%
getting a seat at the table that's
 
04:06:26.309 --> 04:06:26.319 align:start position:0%
co-equal with the attorney general in in
 
04:06:28.469 --> 04:06:28.479 align:start position:0%
hashing out guidelines that
 
04:06:29.830 --> 04:06:29.840 align:start position:0%
that they think will be fair that
 
04:06:34.150 --> 04:06:34.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:37.349 --> 04:06:37.359 align:start position:0%
representative berger thank you
 
04:06:37.359 --> 04:06:39.030 align:start position:0%
representative berger thank you
um

04:06:39.030 --> 04:06:39.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:06:40.710 --> 04:06:40.720 align:start position:0%
i certainly hear where you're coming
 
04:06:40.720 --> 04:06:42.229 align:start position:0%
i certainly hear where you're coming
from

04:06:42.229 --> 04:06:42.239 align:start position:0%
from
 
04:06:42.239 --> 04:06:43.750 align:start position:0%
from
though

04:06:43.750 --> 04:06:43.760 align:start position:0%
though
 
04:06:45.110 --> 04:06:45.120 align:start position:0%
the step
 
04:06:46.870 --> 04:06:46.880 align:start position:0%
what we have written right now is i
 
04:06:48.870 --> 04:06:48.880 align:start position:0%
think we give the attorney general six
 
04:06:48.880 --> 04:06:50.229 align:start position:0%
think we give the attorney general six
months

04:06:50.229 --> 04:06:50.239 align:start position:0%
months
 
04:06:51.910 --> 04:06:51.920 align:start position:0%
to come up with the guidelines wasn't
 
04:06:52.870 --> 04:06:52.880 align:start position:0%
that the
 
04:06:52.880 --> 04:06:54.550 align:start position:0%
that the
criteria

04:06:54.550 --> 04:06:54.560 align:start position:0%
criteria
 
04:06:56.790 --> 04:06:56.800 align:start position:0%
it's i think it was someplace along in
 
04:06:56.800 --> 04:06:58.070 align:start position:0%
it's i think it was someplace along in
there

04:06:58.070 --> 04:06:58.080 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:07:00.229 --> 04:07:00.239 align:start position:0%
yeah i think it's well it's as soon as
 
04:07:02.309 --> 04:07:02.319 align:start position:0%
practical in the first instance but i
 
04:07:04.630 --> 04:07:04.640 align:start position:0%
there's an overall deadline of december
 
04:07:06.630 --> 04:07:06.640 align:start position:0%
one by which that notice has to get
 
04:07:09.030 --> 04:07:09.040 align:start position:0%
published so right it probably ends up
 
04:07:10.710 --> 04:07:10.720 align:start position:0%
roughly being six months to get yeah
 
04:07:12.950 --> 04:07:12.960 align:start position:0%
because this is uh
 
04:07:20.830 --> 04:07:20.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:24.870 --> 04:07:24.880 align:start position:0%
so when when do you throw up your hands
 
04:07:26.389 --> 04:07:26.399 align:start position:0%
and say
 
04:07:28.790 --> 04:07:28.800 align:start position:0%
i can't agree
 
04:07:30.469 --> 04:07:30.479 align:start position:0%
since we have
 
04:07:32.870 --> 04:07:32.880 align:start position:0%
the one december deadline to notify
 
04:07:32.880 --> 04:07:35.110 align:start position:0%
the one december deadline to notify
people

04:07:35.110 --> 04:07:35.120 align:start position:0%
people
 
04:07:37.910 --> 04:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
you know do you do it on the 29th of of
 
04:07:37.920 --> 04:07:38.870 align:start position:0%
you know do you do it on the 29th of of
um

04:07:38.870 --> 04:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:07:38.880 --> 04:07:40.630 align:start position:0%
um
november

04:07:40.630 --> 04:07:40.640 align:start position:0%
november
 
04:07:42.550 --> 04:07:42.560 align:start position:0%
or you know
 
04:07:46.630 --> 04:07:46.640 align:start position:0%
if if we are an agreement on 90 of the
 
04:07:46.640 --> 04:07:47.750 align:start position:0%
if if we are an agreement on 90 of the
stuff

04:07:47.750 --> 04:07:47.760 align:start position:0%
stuff
 
04:07:50.229 --> 04:07:50.239 align:start position:0%
is that not okay
 
04:07:52.229 --> 04:07:52.239 align:start position:0%
you know it's just like as we have gone
 
04:07:54.469 --> 04:07:54.479 align:start position:0%
through the legislation
 
04:07:55.910 --> 04:07:55.920 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:07:55.920 --> 04:07:56.710 align:start position:0%
you know
the

04:07:56.710 --> 04:07:56.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:07:58.710 --> 04:07:58.720 align:start position:0%
the group has accepted
 
04:08:00.550 --> 04:08:00.560 align:start position:0%
a lot of your language
 
04:08:03.110 --> 04:08:03.120 align:start position:0%
the a jesus accepted a lot of the
 
04:08:06.309 --> 04:08:06.319 align:start position:0%
language that dave and
 
04:08:07.670 --> 04:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
provided so
 
04:08:10.870 --> 04:08:10.880 align:start position:0%
i think you know or think you understand
 
04:08:10.880 --> 04:08:12.309 align:start position:0%
i think you know or think you understand
that

04:08:12.309 --> 04:08:12.319 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:08:15.990 --> 04:08:16.000 align:start position:0%
we are willing to to compromise
 
04:08:16.000 --> 04:08:16.870 align:start position:0%
we are willing to to compromise
but

04:08:16.870 --> 04:08:16.880 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:08:19.830 --> 04:08:19.840 align:start position:0%
i need to know you know
 
04:08:23.269 --> 04:08:23.279 align:start position:0%
how how do we get to the six months
 
04:08:25.750 --> 04:08:25.760 align:start position:0%
how do we how do we
 
04:08:28.309 --> 04:08:28.319 align:start position:0%
get to the six months if
 
04:08:31.990 --> 04:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
we don't have one person in one agency
 
04:08:34.309 --> 04:08:34.319 align:start position:0%
in charge that's where that's where my
 
04:08:36.149 --> 04:08:36.159 align:start position:0%
concern is because
 
04:08:38.149 --> 04:08:38.159 align:start position:0%
i'm telling you i'm not going to give
 
04:08:40.389 --> 04:08:40.399 align:start position:0%
the ag
 
04:08:43.189 --> 04:08:43.199 align:start position:0%
any slack on this
 
04:08:44.950 --> 04:08:44.960 align:start position:0%
which means i wouldn't give you any
 
04:08:46.790 --> 04:08:46.800 align:start position:0%
slack either
 
04:08:46.800 --> 04:08:47.830 align:start position:0%
slack either
but

04:08:47.830 --> 04:08:47.840 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:08:49.990 --> 04:08:50.000 align:start position:0%
that's the date
 
04:08:54.389 --> 04:08:54.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:54.399 --> 04:08:55.349 align:start position:0%
 
are

04:08:55.349 --> 04:08:55.359 align:start position:0%
are
 
04:08:58.950 --> 04:08:58.960 align:start position:0%
passionate about getting this
 
04:09:02.309 --> 04:09:02.319 align:start position:0%
going but if you don't like an and or an
 
04:09:02.319 --> 04:09:03.990 align:start position:0%
going but if you don't like an and or an
or

04:09:03.990 --> 04:09:04.000 align:start position:0%
or
 
04:09:07.110 --> 04:09:07.120 align:start position:0%
and you know and that becomes your issue
 
04:09:08.550 --> 04:09:08.560 align:start position:0%
you know then
 
04:09:11.030 --> 04:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
how do we move forward with the deadline
 
04:09:14.309 --> 04:09:14.319 align:start position:0%
and i i don't you know i'm just using
 
04:09:16.309 --> 04:09:16.319 align:start position:0%
that as an example
 
04:09:18.870 --> 04:09:18.880 align:start position:0%
is that a a question or a rhetorical
 
04:09:20.870 --> 04:09:20.880 align:start position:0%
question well
 
04:09:23.030 --> 04:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
i guess that's a question
 
04:09:23.040 --> 04:09:24.469 align:start position:0%
i guess that's a question
okay

04:09:24.469 --> 04:09:24.479 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:09:27.269 --> 04:09:27.279 align:start position:0%
do you care to respond well
 
04:09:28.950 --> 04:09:28.960 align:start position:0%
to go back to what to what jim said i
 
04:09:31.269 --> 04:09:31.279 align:start position:0%
mean i think the answer is
 
04:09:34.790 --> 04:09:34.800 align:start position:0%
uh yeah we negotiate and uh that's why
 
04:09:37.030 --> 04:09:37.040 align:start position:0%
we like the idea of a mediator and it
 
04:09:38.550 --> 04:09:38.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to be the administrator to
 
04:09:40.830 --> 04:09:40.840 align:start position:0%
be somebody completely different
 
04:09:43.750 --> 04:09:43.760 align:start position:0%
um we can you can set a date for our
 
04:09:45.670 --> 04:09:45.680 align:start position:0%
mediation you know we can negotiate
 
04:09:48.309 --> 04:09:48.319 align:start position:0%
ahead of that mediation to get
 
04:09:51.590 --> 04:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
90 of the issues done um and then we've
 
04:09:53.670 --> 04:09:53.680 align:start position:0%
got that last nugget and
 
04:09:55.830 --> 04:09:55.840 align:start position:0%
i mean we um you know i'm sure the
 
04:09:57.030 --> 04:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
attorney general's been to many
 
04:09:58.870 --> 04:09:58.880 align:start position:0%
mediations uh
 
04:10:00.550 --> 04:10:00.560 align:start position:0%
uh you know there's a lot of incentive
 
04:10:02.149 --> 04:10:02.159 align:start position:0%
to get it done
 
04:10:05.429 --> 04:10:05.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:07.910 --> 04:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
follow-up yes follow-up
 
04:10:10.389 --> 04:10:10.399 align:start position:0%
i guess i would
 
04:10:12.469 --> 04:10:12.479 align:start position:0%
i would prefer
 
04:10:15.670 --> 04:10:15.680 align:start position:0%
not to put that in the legislation
 
04:10:17.590 --> 04:10:17.600 align:start position:0%
because that gives you an
 
04:10:20.550 --> 04:10:20.560 align:start position:0%
incentive not to me not
 
04:10:22.950 --> 04:10:22.960 align:start position:0%
not to agree because you know
 
04:10:26.229 --> 04:10:26.239 align:start position:0%
that mediation is going to occur
 
04:10:29.670 --> 04:10:29.680 align:start position:0%
however if uh the ag
 
04:10:34.229 --> 04:10:34.239 align:start position:0%
and you at some point in time are
 
04:10:36.229 --> 04:10:36.239 align:start position:0%
knocking heads he can
 
04:10:38.630 --> 04:10:38.640 align:start position:0%
he has the authority to do what he needs
 
04:10:39.990 --> 04:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
to do
 
04:10:41.269 --> 04:10:41.279 align:start position:0%
to make sure
 
04:10:43.510 --> 04:10:43.520 align:start position:0%
that he meets that deadline
 
04:10:45.429 --> 04:10:45.439 align:start position:0%
so i would
 
04:10:50.070 --> 04:10:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:52.630 --> 04:10:52.640 align:start position:0%
leave it out so so i i can't get out of
 
04:10:56.389 --> 04:10:56.399 align:start position:0%
my military mindset on this is that as a
 
04:10:58.790 --> 04:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
legislature responsible for crafting
 
04:10:58.800 --> 04:10:59.990 align:start position:0%
legislature responsible for crafting
this

04:10:59.990 --> 04:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:11:01.830 --> 04:11:01.840 align:start position:0%
we have to worry about
 
04:11:04.950 --> 04:11:04.960 align:start position:0%
accountability and we can hold the
 
04:11:07.189 --> 04:11:07.199 align:start position:0%
attorney general accountable for
 
04:11:10.309 --> 04:11:10.319 align:start position:0%
delivery of the results we cannot hold
 
04:11:12.550 --> 04:11:12.560 align:start position:0%
the public accountable for delivery of
 
04:11:14.070 --> 04:11:14.080 align:start position:0%
the results
 
04:11:17.990 --> 04:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
so so as an agent of the state
 
04:11:19.670 --> 04:11:19.680 align:start position:0%
the attorney general has all the
 
04:11:22.630 --> 04:11:22.640 align:start position:0%
incentives that he could have i think
 
04:11:26.469 --> 04:11:26.479 align:start position:0%
to to make the uh the the
 
04:11:28.149 --> 04:11:28.159 align:start position:0%
the guidelines
 
04:11:31.429 --> 04:11:31.439 align:start position:0%
fair agreeable acceptable
 
04:11:31.439 --> 04:11:33.030 align:start position:0%
fair agreeable acceptable
and

04:11:33.030 --> 04:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:11:34.710 --> 04:11:34.720 align:start position:0%
but at the end of the day somebody's
 
04:11:37.349 --> 04:11:37.359 align:start position:0%
going to have to decide
 
04:11:38.950 --> 04:11:38.960 align:start position:0%
what are we going to do
 
04:11:41.750 --> 04:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
and as a member of the public if it
 
04:11:44.229 --> 04:11:44.239 align:start position:0%
comes to the joint fiscal committee you
 
04:11:46.229 --> 04:11:46.239 align:start position:0%
still have recourse
 
04:11:49.349 --> 04:11:49.359 align:start position:0%
so it isn't like the attorney general
 
04:11:51.510 --> 04:11:51.520 align:start position:0%
can make a decision without it being
 
04:11:55.030 --> 04:11:55.040 align:start position:0%
subject to legislative review anyway so

04:12:36.950 --> 04:12:36.960 align:start position:0%
we'll discuss it further
 
04:12:40.149 --> 04:12:40.159 align:start position:0%

04:12:43.830 --> 04:12:43.840 align:start position:0%
the the lynn proposal and ask the
 
04:12:45.750 --> 04:12:45.760 align:start position:0%
working group to come back with their
 
04:12:47.910 --> 04:12:47.920 align:start position:0%
language in the bill please raise your
 
04:12:47.920 --> 04:12:56.710 align:start position:0%
language in the bill please raise your
hand

04:12:56.710 --> 04:12:56.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:02.149 --> 04:13:02.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:04.630 --> 04:13:04.640 align:start position:0%
i think three we got represent
 
04:13:06.550 --> 04:13:06.560 align:start position:0%
three it's just hard to see cause the
 
04:13:07.910 --> 04:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
chairs are in the way
 
04:13:10.630 --> 04:13:10.640 align:start position:0%
uh okay so so seven to three we'll we'll
 
04:13:13.510 --> 04:13:13.520 align:start position:0%
do that um
 
04:13:16.710 --> 04:13:16.720 align:start position:0%
okay then the next item i had was
 
04:13:18.950 --> 04:13:18.960 align:start position:0%
making sure that thank you uh making
 
04:13:20.950 --> 04:13:20.960 align:start position:0%
sure there's a sunset date
 
04:13:23.670 --> 04:13:23.680 align:start position:0%
so that the law can self-close and and i
 
04:13:25.429 --> 04:13:25.439 align:start position:0%
guess the working group's gonna do that
 
04:13:27.429 --> 04:13:27.439 align:start position:0%
because it's got to be in the ols
 
04:13:29.990 --> 04:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
version yes and then
 
04:13:32.630 --> 04:13:32.640 align:start position:0%
i wrote a note something about retired
 
04:13:35.110 --> 04:13:35.120 align:start position:0%
judge language there was something about
 
04:13:38.830 --> 04:13:38.840 align:start position:0%
if you selected a retired judge then the
 
04:13:41.349 --> 04:13:41.359 align:start position:0%
retirement issue
 
04:13:44.149 --> 04:13:44.159 align:start position:0%
do we need to write language on that
 
04:13:44.159 --> 04:13:45.349 align:start position:0%
do we need to write language on that
yes

04:13:45.349 --> 04:13:45.359 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:13:47.670 --> 04:13:47.680 align:start position:0%
yes and uh

mike and kevin have that already
 
04:13:52.870 --> 04:13:52.880 align:start position:0%
okay so we take care of it so with that
 
04:13:56.070 --> 04:13:56.080 align:start position:0%
i i think we've force marched through
 
04:13:58.950 --> 04:13:58.960 align:start position:0%

04:14:01.590 --> 04:14:01.600 align:start position:0%

04:14:38.960 --> 04:15:00.229 align:start position:0%
 
finished

04:15:00.229 --> 04:15:00.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:01.990 --> 04:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
mr ripple
 
04:15:03.429 --> 04:15:03.439 align:start position:0%
miss ripple
 
04:15:06.469 --> 04:15:06.479 align:start position:0%
did did you hand out the ols
 
04:15:09.269 --> 04:15:09.279 align:start position:0%
change document
 
04:16:58.309 --> 04:16:58.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:00.710 --> 04:17:00.720 align:start position:0%
okay i'm going to um

call the hearing on hb 103 back into
 
04:17:05.120 --> 04:17:06.389 align:start position:0%
call the hearing on hb 103 back into
order

04:17:06.389 --> 04:17:06.399 align:start position:0%
order
 
04:17:06.399 --> 04:17:07.830 align:start position:0%
order
um

04:17:07.830 --> 04:17:07.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:17:09.830 --> 04:17:09.840 align:start position:0%
the reason the reason we're doing this
 
04:17:12.309 --> 04:17:12.319 align:start position:0%
is because
 
04:17:16.550 --> 04:17:16.560 align:start position:0%
we we had ols turn around for us
 
04:17:19.269 --> 04:17:19.279 align:start position:0%
very rapidly an amendment
 
04:17:21.110 --> 04:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
that you should have
 
04:17:21.120 --> 04:17:25.269 align:start position:0%
that you should have
2022-0

04:17:25.269 --> 04:17:25.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:25.279 --> 04:17:27.189 align:start position:0%
 
hotel

04:17:27.189 --> 04:17:27.199 align:start position:0%
hotel
 
04:17:31.189 --> 04:17:31.199 align:start position:0%
does everyone have that version
 
04:17:31.199 --> 04:17:32.389 align:start position:0%
does everyone have that version
okay

04:17:32.389 --> 04:17:32.399 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:17:34.070 --> 04:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
in this version
 
04:17:36.309 --> 04:17:36.319 align:start position:0%
we added a sentence
 
04:17:40.309 --> 04:17:40.319 align:start position:0%
that shows up on line eight at the end
 
04:17:43.349 --> 04:17:43.359 align:start position:0%
that sentence runs through line ten it
 
04:17:43.359 --> 04:17:44.550 align:start position:0%
that sentence runs through line ten it
reads

04:17:44.550 --> 04:17:44.560 align:start position:0%
reads
 
04:17:46.950 --> 04:17:46.960 align:start position:0%
in addition the general court recognizes
 
04:17:48.950 --> 04:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
that personal responsibility is an
 
04:17:51.349 --> 04:17:51.359 align:start position:0%
essential component of any strategy to
 
04:17:55.429 --> 04:17:55.439 align:start position:0%
improve individual oral health
 
04:17:56.870 --> 04:17:56.880 align:start position:0%
is there
 
04:17:58.950 --> 04:17:58.960 align:start position:0%
didn't seem like there was any objection
 
04:18:01.429 --> 04:18:01.439 align:start position:0%
prior if there is
 
04:18:03.349 --> 04:18:03.359 align:start position:0%
please speak up
 
04:18:05.830 --> 04:18:05.840 align:start position:0%
then i think we go down to
 
04:18:05.840 --> 04:18:07.110 align:start position:0%
then i think we go down to
[Music]

04:18:07.110 --> 04:18:07.120 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:18:07.120 --> 04:18:15.110 align:start position:0%
[Music]
line

04:18:15.110 --> 04:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:17.750 --> 04:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
it's it's in it's in that area between
 
04:18:21.910 --> 04:18:21.920 align:start position:0%
lines 19 and 22 on the first page
 
04:18:23.750 --> 04:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
and what did we add here mr ripple it
 
04:18:25.269 --> 04:18:25.279 align:start position:0%
looks like we added
 
04:18:27.189 --> 04:18:27.199 align:start position:0%
fostering individual behaviors that
 
04:18:29.110 --> 04:18:29.120 align:start position:0%
promote good oral health
 
04:18:31.269 --> 04:18:31.279 align:start position:0%
yes yep on line 21
 
04:18:32.870 --> 04:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
on line 21
 
04:18:35.510 --> 04:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
was that the only change in the sentence
 
04:18:38.790 --> 04:18:38.800 align:start position:0%
yes it was i think it is okay
 
04:18:38.800 --> 04:18:39.990 align:start position:0%
yes it was i think it is okay
then

04:18:39.990 --> 04:18:40.000 align:start position:0%
then
 
04:18:42.229 --> 04:18:42.239 align:start position:0%
again if you know speak up if you have
 
04:18:45.030 --> 04:18:45.040 align:start position:0%
any opposition to this um
 
04:18:50.309 --> 04:18:50.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:51.910 --> 04:18:51.920 align:start position:0%
so i can if you'd like i can point this
 
04:18:54.630 --> 04:18:54.640 align:start position:0%
28 go ahead walk us through
 
04:18:57.110 --> 04:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
i know i'm sorry on line 29 you've added
 
04:18:59.429 --> 04:18:59.439 align:start position:0%
patient education
 
04:19:00.830 --> 04:19:00.840 align:start position:0%
to the list of the
 
04:19:03.670 --> 04:19:03.680 align:start position:0%
states estate's requirements right and
 
04:19:06.070 --> 04:19:06.080 align:start position:0%
then the same on page two
 
04:19:10.710 --> 04:19:10.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:13.189 --> 04:19:13.199 align:start position:0%
okay and and so that just made sure that
 
04:19:15.510 --> 04:19:15.520 align:start position:0%
the framework included those concepts
 
04:19:18.710 --> 04:19:18.720 align:start position:0%
because we already had it embedded
 
04:19:22.070 --> 04:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
in the details of the contract
 
04:19:22.080 --> 04:19:23.750 align:start position:0%
in the details of the contract
where

04:19:23.750 --> 04:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
where
 
04:19:25.910 --> 04:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
we we said that
 
04:19:27.670 --> 04:19:27.680 align:start position:0%
they needed to receive
 
04:19:29.910 --> 04:19:29.920 align:start position:0%
education for behavior management and
 
04:19:32.389 --> 04:19:32.399 align:start position:0%
smoking succession counseling
 
04:19:35.189 --> 04:19:35.199 align:start position:0%
so so there wasn't a substantive change
 
04:19:37.349 --> 04:19:37.359 align:start position:0%
it was just making sure that it was
 
04:19:39.510 --> 04:19:39.520 align:start position:0%
more clear that personal responsibility
 
04:19:39.520 --> 04:19:41.830 align:start position:0%
more clear that personal responsibility
matters

04:19:41.830 --> 04:19:41.840 align:start position:0%
matters
 
04:19:46.229 --> 04:19:46.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:46.239 --> 04:19:47.189 align:start position:0%
 
no

04:19:47.189 --> 04:19:47.199 align:start position:0%
no
 
04:19:47.199 --> 04:19:48.309 align:start position:0%
no
okay

04:19:48.309 --> 04:19:48.319 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:19:52.950 --> 04:19:52.960 align:start position:0%
so what i would like to do is to um
 
04:19:55.429 --> 04:19:55.439 align:start position:0%
do do we need to take a role on this
 
04:19:57.349 --> 04:19:57.359 align:start position:0%
since we're going to recommend to the
 
04:19:59.189 --> 04:19:59.199 align:start position:0%
full finance committee a position on
 
04:20:01.269 --> 04:20:01.279 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
04:20:02.790 --> 04:20:02.800 align:start position:0%
yes yes
 
04:20:06.149 --> 04:20:06.159 align:start position:0%
okay so so i would entertain
 
04:20:07.429 --> 04:20:07.439 align:start position:0%
a motion
 
04:20:10.189 --> 04:20:10.199 align:start position:0%
