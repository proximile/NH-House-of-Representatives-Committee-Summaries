00:37:33.470 --> 00:37:33.480 align:start position:0%
or attempted to commit any of these
 
00:37:39.510 --> 00:37:39.520 align:start position:0%
crimes defined in RSA 631 or 639 col 3A
 
00:37:42.589 --> 00:37:42.599 align:start position:0%
against a person under 13 years of age
 
00:37:44.829 --> 00:37:44.839 align:start position:0%
so couple issues that were discussed
 
00:37:46.990 --> 00:37:47.000 align:start position:0%
during the hearing um some questions we
 
00:37:49.270 --> 00:37:49.280 align:start position:0%
heard from the committee were first of
 
00:37:52.950 --> 00:37:52.960 align:start position:0%
all the necessity um for the class a
 
00:37:55.550 --> 00:37:55.560 align:start position:0%
felony or I believe it was class B
 
00:37:57.950 --> 00:37:57.960 align:start position:0%
felony for the second one um
 
00:38:02.510 --> 00:38:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:04.430 --> 00:38:04.440 align:start position:0%
discussiones representative Shar did you
 
00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:17.589 align:start position:0%
 
proposal

00:38:17.589 --> 00:38:17.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:20.430 --> 00:38:20.440 align:start position:0%
um I'm very appreciative of the County
 
00:38:24.230 --> 00:38:24.240 align:start position:0%
attorneys bringing this bill um uh I I
 
00:38:25.950 --> 00:38:25.960 align:start position:0%
understand what uh the issue that
 
00:38:29.309 --> 00:38:29.319 align:start position:0%
they're struggling with um uh and more
 
00:38:33.589 --> 00:38:33.599 align:start position:0%
broadly I think the issue is uh when do
 
00:38:36.230 --> 00:38:36.240 align:start position:0%
we have the criminal justice system step
 
00:38:40.309 --> 00:38:40.319 align:start position:0%
in and really take over dealing with
 
00:38:40.319 --> 00:38:41.230 align:start position:0%
in and really take over dealing with
some

00:38:41.230 --> 00:38:41.240 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:38:44.390 --> 00:38:44.400 align:start position:0%
parents uh that very likely are already
 
00:38:48.630 --> 00:38:48.640 align:start position:0%
involved in DCF process um and you know
 
00:38:51.470 --> 00:38:51.480 align:start position:0%
which can result that process can result
 
00:38:53.390 --> 00:38:53.400 align:start position:0%
in termination of parental rights that's
 
00:38:57.230 --> 00:38:57.240 align:start position:0%
kind of the the the uh the backend uh uh
 
00:38:59.910 --> 00:38:59.920 align:start position:0%
uh most dramatic result from the DCF
 
00:39:04.309 --> 00:39:04.319 align:start position:0%
process uh we all appreciate that DCF is
 
00:39:07.510 --> 00:39:07.520 align:start position:0%
not by their doing uh
 
00:39:11.670 --> 00:39:11.680 align:start position:0%
underfunded um and um and and may not be
 
00:39:14.309 --> 00:39:14.319 align:start position:0%
able to address as many families as they
 
00:39:17.950 --> 00:39:17.960 align:start position:0%
would like to um my con that's on the
 
00:39:19.990 --> 00:39:20.000 align:start position:0%
one side and I think the issues and the
 
00:39:23.109 --> 00:39:23.119 align:start position:0%
testimony we heard are it's very
 
00:39:25.470 --> 00:39:25.480 align:start position:0%
important to address this issue what I
 
00:39:27.870 --> 00:39:27.880 align:start position:0%
address this issue what I heard from the
 
00:39:30.270 --> 00:39:30.280 align:start position:0%
County attorneys is why they decided to
 
00:39:32.750 --> 00:39:32.760 align:start position:0%
bring this bill
 
00:39:37.550 --> 00:39:37.560 align:start position:0%
257 um is that they weren't able to work
 
00:39:41.309 --> 00:39:41.319 align:start position:0%
with the child endangerment
 
00:39:46.790 --> 00:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
statute um which uh is uh
 
00:39:49.750 --> 00:39:49.760 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
00:39:52.990 --> 00:39:53.000 align:start position:0%
6393 um and the reason they weren't able
 
00:39:56.670 --> 00:39:56.680 align:start position:0%
to work with it on in in many cases is
 
00:40:01.109 --> 00:40:01.119 align:start position:0%
because the statute uh uh read like this
 
00:40:03.069 --> 00:40:03.079 align:start position:0%
a person is guilty of endangering the
 
00:40:06.270 --> 00:40:06.280 align:start position:0%
welfare of a child or incompetent if he
 
00:40:07.990 --> 00:40:08.000 align:start position:0%
knowingly endangers the welfare of a
 
00:40:11.990 --> 00:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
child under 18 years of old of an or of
 
00:40:14.230 --> 00:40:14.240 align:start position:0%
an incompetent person by purposely
 
00:40:16.069 --> 00:40:16.079 align:start position:0%
violating a duty of care and then it
 
00:40:19.309 --> 00:40:19.319 align:start position:0%
goes on um they said the word purposely
 
00:40:23.069 --> 00:40:23.079 align:start position:0%
there which means uh you intend the
 
00:40:27.190 --> 00:40:27.200 align:start position:0%
result of your conduct that's your goal
 
00:40:29.750 --> 00:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
uh that's the word purposely that that
 
00:40:31.950 --> 00:40:31.960 align:start position:0%
makes it very difficult to prove in
 
00:40:36.870 --> 00:40:36.880 align:start position:0%
these cases um my tentative proposal is
 
00:40:39.710 --> 00:40:39.720 align:start position:0%
to change is to accommodate their
 
00:40:41.069 --> 00:40:41.079 align:start position:0%
struggle with
 
00:40:44.750 --> 00:40:44.760 align:start position:0%
6393 and change that word purposely to
 
00:40:48.510 --> 00:40:48.520 align:start position:0%
knowingly which makes it much more
 
00:40:51.470 --> 00:40:51.480 align:start position:0%
workable for them to prove cases a
 
00:40:55.230 --> 00:40:55.240 align:start position:0%
knowingly statute uh the knowingly is
 
00:40:58.710 --> 00:40:58.720 align:start position:0%
defined as they know that their conduct
 
00:41:02.470 --> 00:41:02.480 align:start position:0%
will result in the consequences um so I
 
00:41:06.230 --> 00:41:06.240 align:start position:0%
think that broadens the scope of
 
00:41:09.470 --> 00:41:09.480 align:start position:0%
6393 and it uh
 
00:41:12.990 --> 00:41:13.000 align:start position:0%
it relieves us of the difficulties of
 
00:41:16.190 --> 00:41:16.200 align:start position:0%
sorting through a lot of the language of
 
00:41:20.190 --> 00:41:20.200 align:start position:0%
HB 257 which while well intended is
 
00:41:22.910 --> 00:41:22.920 align:start position:0%
really there's there's a lot of things
 
00:41:26.750 --> 00:41:26.760 align:start position:0%
that are undefined uh I guess the the
 
00:41:31.870 --> 00:41:31.880 align:start position:0%
final thing I would say is uh I'm leery
 
00:41:34.270 --> 00:41:34.280 align:start position:0%
of the criminal justice
 
00:41:37.589 --> 00:41:37.599 align:start position:0%
system being able given the limits of
 
00:41:42.309 --> 00:41:42.319 align:start position:0%
its resources and its tools to do better
 
00:41:45.670 --> 00:41:45.680 align:start position:0%
in reaching the the parents we want to
 
00:41:49.630 --> 00:41:49.640 align:start position:0%
reach than DCF does the the criminal
 
00:41:52.309 --> 00:41:52.319 align:start position:0%
justice system you know they have they
 
00:41:55.069 --> 00:41:55.079 align:start position:0%
have fines they have the threat of jail
 
00:41:57.710 --> 00:41:57.720 align:start position:0%
they have probation but but you know
 
00:41:59.470 --> 00:41:59.480 align:start position:0%
what we really want to do is stop these
 
00:42:01.750 --> 00:42:01.760 align:start position:0%
parents from engaging in this kind of
 
00:42:04.670 --> 00:42:04.680 align:start position:0%
behavior and what would happen if if
 
00:42:06.550 --> 00:42:06.560 align:start position:0%
they were on probation based on a
 
00:42:09.430 --> 00:42:09.440 align:start position:0%
criminal charge is a probation officer
 
00:42:12.510 --> 00:42:12.520 align:start position:0%
would say you got to go see Social
 
00:42:15.710 --> 00:42:15.720 align:start position:0%
Services uh on the if you don't do that
 
00:42:17.550 --> 00:42:17.560 align:start position:0%
we're going to impose your jail sentence
 
00:42:19.870 --> 00:42:19.880 align:start position:0%
I mean that's that's the tool the best
 
00:42:23.470 --> 00:42:23.480 align:start position:0%
tool they have to try and remedy uh the
 
00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:26.720 align:start position:0%
conduct of the parents but we all know
 
00:42:28.990 --> 00:42:29.000 align:start position:0%
the social services in New
 
00:42:32.309 --> 00:42:32.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire putting aside DCF to manage
 
00:42:33.990 --> 00:42:34.000 align:start position:0%
this are almost
 
00:42:38.750 --> 00:42:38.760 align:start position:0%
non-existent um so I'm though I fully
 
00:42:42.069 --> 00:42:42.079 align:start position:0%
appreciate uh what we're trying to do
 
00:42:42.079 --> 00:42:42.790 align:start position:0%
appreciate uh what we're trying to do
with

00:42:42.790 --> 00:42:42.800 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:42:46.829 --> 00:42:46.839 align:start position:0%
257 I think this is a better way to get
 
00:42:48.589 --> 00:42:48.599 align:start position:0%
there for
 
00:42:51.670 --> 00:42:51.680 align:start position:0%
now have you addressed this with the
 
00:42:53.069 --> 00:42:53.079 align:start position:0%
County Attorney at all have you had a
 
00:42:55.349 --> 00:42:55.359 align:start position:0%
chance to talk to them no and I can I
 
00:42:56.829 --> 00:42:56.839 align:start position:0%
can do that is anyone here from the
 
00:43:04.190 --> 00:43:04.200 align:start position:0%

sex trafficking storefront New
 
00:43:34.349 --> 00:43:34.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is that correct y okay so this
 
00:43:36.589 --> 00:43:36.599 align:start position:0%
is the this is not what we were talking
 
00:43:38.870 --> 00:43:38.880 align:start position:0%
about earlier so that's
 
00:43:42.309 --> 00:43:42.319 align:start position:0%
one yeah that's the
 
00:43:46.470 --> 00:43:46.480 align:start position:0%
one yeah yeah I think that um
 
00:43:49.069 --> 00:43:49.079 align:start position:0%
we I think we came to a conclusion that
 
00:43:50.750 --> 00:43:50.760 align:start position:0%
we don't want to study this anymore we
 
00:43:53.990 --> 00:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
want to actually pass a law um is there
 
00:43:55.990 --> 00:43:56.000 align:start position:0%
anyone here today specifically for this
 
00:43:58.349 --> 00:43:58.359 align:start position:0%
law would you i' like to address all of
 
00:44:03.349 --> 00:44:03.359 align:start position:0%

up what we're interested in right now is
 
00:44:09.230 --> 00:44:09.240 align:start position:0%
we we want to write a law to um so we
 
00:44:10.710 --> 00:44:10.720 align:start position:0%
we're all set with the study committee
 
00:44:13.150 --> 00:44:13.160 align:start position:0%
so any language that you have um we'd
 
00:44:21.109 --> 00:44:21.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:24.150 --> 00:44:24.160 align:start position:0%

foot from Derry representing Rockingham
 
00:44:33.829 --> 00:44:33.839 align:start position:0%
13 um I am a State Rep but also a town
 
00:44:36.630 --> 00:44:36.640 align:start position:0%
counselor in that town um as you know we
 
00:44:38.069 --> 00:44:38.079 align:start position:0%
we testified before you last week this
 
00:44:41.309 --> 00:44:41.319 align:start position:0%
is a real concern in der and Statewide
 
00:44:42.829 --> 00:44:42.839 align:start position:0%
and as you heard from other testimony
 
00:44:45.750 --> 00:44:45.760 align:start position:0%
this is an international issue and
 
00:44:48.150 --> 00:44:48.160 align:start position:0%
um sorry that's my medical alarm going
 
00:44:51.710 --> 00:44:51.720 align:start position:0%
off um
 
00:44:54.710 --> 00:44:54.720 align:start position:0%
and we also concur this is a this is a
 
00:44:57.150 --> 00:44:57.160 align:start position:0%
bill that needs to have some affirmative
 
00:45:00.470 --> 00:45:00.480 align:start position:0%
action um sooner than later as as you've
 
00:45:02.270 --> 00:45:02.280 align:start position:0%
heard last week There's the communities
 
00:45:04.589 --> 00:45:04.599 align:start position:0%
around us the states around us um in New
 
00:45:07.109 --> 00:45:07.119 align:start position:0%
England had make it a class B felony I
 
00:45:11.349 --> 00:45:11.359 align:start position:0%
believe for anyone who Harbors these or
 
00:45:12.870 --> 00:45:12.880 align:start position:0%
knowingly allows these business to
 
00:45:14.990 --> 00:45:15.000 align:start position:0%
happen so that's what I would encourage
 
00:45:16.990 --> 00:45:17.000 align:start position:0%
this committee to do is make an
 
00:45:18.630 --> 00:45:18.640 align:start position:0%
amendment so we can pass that law and
 
00:45:21.430 --> 00:45:21.440 align:start position:0%
make this a felony so we can really um
 
00:45:23.990 --> 00:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
put a a stop to this um and I'll leave
 
00:45:25.829 --> 00:45:25.839 align:start position:0%
it at that that's you you have all the
 
00:45:28.349 --> 00:45:28.359 align:start position:0%
information Before You and I
 
00:45:30.510 --> 00:45:30.520 align:start position:0%
what's going on in your community what
 
00:45:32.030 --> 00:45:32.040 align:start position:0%
are you getting for feedback from law
 
00:45:33.750 --> 00:45:33.760 align:start position:0%
enforcement as far as why they are not
 
00:45:36.069 --> 00:45:36.079 align:start position:0%
able to do anything right
 
00:45:36.079 --> 00:45:37.630 align:start position:0%
able to do anything right
now

00:45:37.630 --> 00:45:37.640 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:45:40.790 --> 00:45:40.800 align:start position:0%
so the the the basically because there's
 
00:45:42.589 --> 00:45:42.599 align:start position:0%
really nothing that sticks you know they
 
00:45:44.150 --> 00:45:44.160 align:start position:0%
go in there and it's such a lowlevel
 
00:45:46.589 --> 00:45:46.599 align:start position:0%
offense and I'm paraphrasing um that's
 
00:45:48.069 --> 00:45:48.079 align:start position:0%
fine coincidentally I do have a meeting
 
00:45:50.349 --> 00:45:50.359 align:start position:0%
with the chief um upcoming and the Town
 
00:45:52.670 --> 00:45:52.680 align:start position:0%
Administrator about this um I did speak
 
00:45:54.549 --> 00:45:54.559 align:start position:0%
with Homeland Security agents last week
 
00:45:56.710 --> 00:45:56.720 align:start position:0%
as well yeah and essentially it's just
 
00:45:59.510 --> 00:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
it there's not enough teeth in it to
 
00:46:01.670 --> 00:46:01.680 align:start position:0%
have anything stick and it's and
 
00:46:03.309 --> 00:46:03.319 align:start position:0%
basically it's a it's a misdemeanor
 
00:46:07.829 --> 00:46:07.839 align:start position:0%
crime level offense and these um actors
 
00:46:08.950 --> 00:46:08.960 align:start position:0%
they just keep moving around from
 
00:46:11.349 --> 00:46:11.359 align:start position:0%
location to location the the girls from
 
00:46:13.109 --> 00:46:13.119 align:start position:0%
what I'm aware of the the ladies
 
00:46:15.349 --> 00:46:15.359 align:start position:0%
involved in this business they get
 
00:46:17.950 --> 00:46:17.960 align:start position:0%
cycled out every 10 days or so so they
 
00:46:19.790 --> 00:46:19.800 align:start position:0%
it's always it's hard to hit a moving
 
00:46:22.670 --> 00:46:22.680 align:start position:0%
Target essentially yeah so
 
00:46:25.109 --> 00:46:25.119 align:start position:0%
um that that's the the nuts and bolts of
 
00:46:26.430 --> 00:46:26.440 align:start position:0%
it it's just there's not enough teeth to
 
00:46:28.270 --> 00:46:28.280 align:start position:0%
have anything stick to make this
 
00:46:31.710 --> 00:46:31.720 align:start position:0%
worthwhile going in and um and I'll let
 
00:46:33.109 --> 00:46:33.119 align:start position:0%
the Town Administrator address it
 
00:46:34.390 --> 00:46:34.400 align:start position:0%
further if he has any more technical
 
00:46:36.630 --> 00:46:36.640 align:start position:0%
aspect to it but that's what it comes
 
00:46:39.030 --> 00:46:39.040 align:start position:0%
down to um there has been some
 
00:46:41.309 --> 00:46:41.319 align:start position:0%
discussion in the past about maybe
 
00:46:44.069 --> 00:46:44.079 align:start position:0%
empowering oplc to be able to go in uh
 
00:46:47.990 --> 00:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
under the massage licensing and do snap
 
00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:49.270 align:start position:0%
under the massage licensing and do snap
unannounced

00:46:49.270 --> 00:46:49.280 align:start position:0%
unannounced
 
00:46:52.829 --> 00:46:52.839 align:start position:0%
inspections um and which would it the
 
00:46:54.270 --> 00:46:54.280 align:start position:0%
problem with that is is when you do a
 
00:46:56.910 --> 00:46:56.920 align:start position:0%
regulatory inspection and you you use it
 
00:46:58.190 --> 00:46:58.200 align:start position:0%
for the purpose of getting law
 
00:47:00.470 --> 00:47:00.480 align:start position:0%
enforcement information the regulatory
 
00:47:02.190 --> 00:47:02.200 align:start position:0%
then becomes the agent of the state and
 
00:47:03.950 --> 00:47:03.960 align:start position:0%
they are for all intents and purposes
 
00:47:05.670 --> 00:47:05.680 align:start position:0%
law enforcement and they need a search
 
00:47:07.670 --> 00:47:07.680 align:start position:0%
warrant so it's really difficult to use
 
00:47:11.309 --> 00:47:11.319 align:start position:0%
one to get to the other um but we we'll
 
00:47:13.030 --> 00:47:13.040 align:start position:0%
take we'll take that on advisement we're
 
00:47:15.230 --> 00:47:15.240 align:start position:0%
going to come up with something right
 
00:47:18.470 --> 00:47:18.480 align:start position:0%
um so just may i' also representative
 
00:47:20.990 --> 00:47:21.000 align:start position:0%
jod Nelson and I met with oplc last year
 
00:47:23.069 --> 00:47:23.079 align:start position:0%
MH and you know basically the
 
00:47:25.109 --> 00:47:25.119 align:start position:0%
understaffing and the the amount of
 
00:47:27.349 --> 00:47:27.359 align:start position:0%
volume of what they deal with yeah this
 
00:47:29.990 --> 00:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
basically was outside of that purview so
 
00:47:32.030 --> 00:47:32.040 align:start position:0%
again there's that they said essentially
 
00:47:34.030 --> 00:47:34.040 align:start position:0%
there's nothing we can really do and and
 
00:47:37.030 --> 00:47:37.040 align:start position:0%
with these um parlors opening up on Body
 
00:47:38.630 --> 00:47:38.640 align:start position:0%
Works which which was a license out of
 
00:47:40.470 --> 00:47:40.480 align:start position:0%
New York it does become a licensing
 
00:47:42.990 --> 00:47:43.000 align:start position:0%
issue because um is it a reciprocity
 
00:47:44.990 --> 00:47:45.000 align:start position:0%
issue so how does the town how does the
 
00:47:47.950 --> 00:47:47.960 align:start position:0%
state or the town regulate those coming
 
00:47:50.430 --> 00:47:50.440 align:start position:0%
in yeah like who oversees that so that's
 
00:47:52.470 --> 00:47:52.480 align:start position:0%
a big concern um and then we end up
 
00:47:54.470 --> 00:47:54.480 align:start position:0%
having to create a whole new bureaucracy
 
00:47:57.390 --> 00:47:57.400 align:start position:0%
OB right so it just it seems like you
 
00:47:59.630 --> 00:47:59.640 align:start position:0%
know at for the lay person oh this is
 
00:48:01.510 --> 00:48:01.520 align:start position:0%
easy fix yeah but it's not it's really
 
00:48:03.910 --> 00:48:03.920 align:start position:0%
not it's it's really convoluted and that
 
00:48:05.750 --> 00:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
we need to really we need to hone in on
 
00:48:08.950 --> 00:48:08.960 align:start position:0%
it and and make this a serious offense
 
00:48:11.069 --> 00:48:11.079 align:start position:0%
and crack down on it okay so I thank you
 
00:48:13.190 --> 00:48:13.200 align:start position:0%
for your time I appreciate it thank you
 
00:48:15.349 --> 00:48:15.359 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak to town ad
 
00:48:17.349 --> 00:48:17.359 align:start position:0%
Ministry you don't have to only if you
 
00:48:17.359 --> 00:48:19.670 align:start position:0%
Ministry you don't have to only if you
want

00:48:19.670 --> 00:48:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:22.150 --> 00:48:22.160 align:start position:0%
to represent sh did you have a comment
 
00:48:27.230 --> 00:48:27.240 align:start position:0%
or yeah I was I was wondering what it be
 
00:48:29.309 --> 00:48:29.319 align:start position:0%
I think it'd be very useful I I remember
 
00:48:31.270 --> 00:48:31.280 align:start position:0%
from last week the testimony from the
 
00:48:32.990 --> 00:48:33.000 align:start position:0%
two people from Homeland Security that
 
00:48:34.829 --> 00:48:34.839 align:start position:0%
they were very committed to taking
 
00:48:37.309 --> 00:48:37.319 align:start position:0%
action and not having a study committee
 
00:48:40.829 --> 00:48:40.839 align:start position:0%
and you know it I I suggest it might be
 
00:48:43.430 --> 00:48:43.440 align:start position:0%
very useful if you all were to get
 
00:48:44.990 --> 00:48:45.000 align:start position:0%
together with the homeland security
 
00:48:47.950 --> 00:48:47.960 align:start position:0%
people and talk through exactly what you
 
00:48:50.430 --> 00:48:50.440 align:start position:0%
want to propose so there's coordination
 
00:48:57.910 --> 00:48:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:01.750 --> 00:49:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:03.589 --> 00:49:03.599 align:start position:0%
that I was just going to say I think
 
00:49:05.630 --> 00:49:05.640 align:start position:0%
they literally had a list of of
 
00:49:07.910 --> 00:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
suggestions so that would be super
 
00:49:10.230 --> 00:49:10.240 align:start position:0%
help good morning I'm Dave Karen the
 
00:49:11.829 --> 00:49:11.839 align:start position:0%
Town Administrator and Derry thank you
 
00:49:13.470 --> 00:49:13.480 align:start position:0%
for your time working on
 
00:49:16.069 --> 00:49:16.079 align:start position:0%
hb45 speaking with Chief fioli the
 
00:49:17.750 --> 00:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
frustration is is that there are
 
00:49:19.549 --> 00:49:19.559 align:start position:0%
language barriers in refusal to
 
00:49:21.630 --> 00:49:21.640 align:start position:0%
cooperate for the workers who are
 
00:49:23.349 --> 00:49:23.359 align:start position:0%
actually operating in these massage
 
00:49:26.309 --> 00:49:26.319 align:start position:0%
parlors so we think there's really a a
 
00:49:28.910 --> 00:49:28.920 align:start position:0%
three prong approaches one is that a
 
00:49:31.430 --> 00:49:31.440 align:start position:0%
Statewide database for licensure no
 
00:49:35.150 --> 00:49:35.160 align:start position:0%
reciprocity and that if if uh if uh a
 
00:49:37.349 --> 00:49:37.359 align:start position:0%
female works one she has to be licensed
 
00:49:39.750 --> 00:49:39.760 align:start position:0%
to that location only because we're find
 
00:49:41.309 --> 00:49:41.319 align:start position:0%
that jumping from Community to community
 
00:49:42.910 --> 00:49:42.920 align:start position:0%
so doing it on individual Community
 
00:49:45.430 --> 00:49:45.440 align:start position:0%
basis has not been very effective also
 
00:49:47.470 --> 00:49:47.480 align:start position:0%
what's really be effective is what uh
 
00:49:50.190 --> 00:49:50.200 align:start position:0%
pamer has proposed here is to have the
 
00:49:52.470 --> 00:49:52.480 align:start position:0%
landlord assume some responsibility for
 
00:49:54.789 --> 00:49:54.799 align:start position:0%
who's occupying their premises we found
 
00:49:56.230 --> 00:49:56.240 align:start position:0%
that's been very successful in other
 
00:49:58.789 --> 00:49:58.799 align:start position:0%
states uh and has really really uh
 
00:50:01.630 --> 00:50:01.640 align:start position:0%
slowed down the proliferation of these
 
00:50:04.150 --> 00:50:04.160 align:start position:0%
activities yeah I would I would assume
 
00:50:05.750 --> 00:50:05.760 align:start position:0%
once you have some skin in the game as
 
00:50:07.829 --> 00:50:07.839 align:start position:0%
far as losing potentially losing some
 
00:50:09.430 --> 00:50:09.440 align:start position:0%
real estate um you're going to be much
 
00:50:11.349 --> 00:50:11.359 align:start position:0%
more careful about what goes on in your
 
00:50:13.430 --> 00:50:13.440 align:start position:0%
and at the F FY level it tends to get
 
00:50:15.990 --> 00:50:16.000 align:start position:0%
the landlord's attention yeah okay great
 
00:50:17.990 --> 00:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for that input thank you yeah
 
00:50:19.750 --> 00:50:19.760 align:start position:0%
and uh congratulations on your Police
 
00:50:21.270 --> 00:50:21.280 align:start position:0%
Department being accredited one the
 
00:50:24.549 --> 00:50:24.559 align:start position:0%
first one in state
 
00:50:33.470 --> 00:50:33.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:35.910 --> 00:50:35.920 align:start position:0%
good morning um so we're from the
 
00:50:39.470 --> 00:50:39.480 align:start position:0%
Coalition um so page two I think is
 
00:50:42.069 --> 00:50:42.079 align:start position:0%
really what speaks to of the handout I
 
00:50:44.510 --> 00:50:44.520 align:start position:0%
gave you and um can email copies to the
 
00:50:46.710 --> 00:50:46.720 align:start position:0%
rest of the folks here um page two I
 
00:50:48.069 --> 00:50:48.079 align:start position:0%
think really speaks to that taking
 
00:50:50.190 --> 00:50:50.200 align:start position:0%
action component um as something that we
 
00:50:53.510 --> 00:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
could do this year um that immediately
 
00:50:55.829 --> 00:50:55.839 align:start position:0%
would speak to what has been brought
 
00:50:57.789 --> 00:50:57.799 align:start position:0%
forward this morning we weren't sure if
 
00:51:00.510 --> 00:51:00.520 align:start position:0%
there were still sort of if if help if
 
00:51:03.150 --> 00:51:03.160 align:start position:0%
having a study commission still could
 
00:51:05.950 --> 00:51:05.960 align:start position:0%
help move or continue the conversation
 
00:51:09.349 --> 00:51:09.359 align:start position:0%
to to have further uh legislative action
 
00:51:13.309 --> 00:51:13.319 align:start position:0%
um but this yeah yeah so I think we just
 
00:51:14.950 --> 00:51:14.960 align:start position:0%
didn't know what the committee would be
 
00:51:16.589 --> 00:51:16.599 align:start position:0%
most favorable or what would be most
 
00:51:18.349 --> 00:51:18.359 align:start position:0%
strategic in terms of continuing
 
00:51:20.150 --> 00:51:20.160 align:start position:0%
ensuring that we really address this
 
00:51:22.470 --> 00:51:22.480 align:start position:0%
issue um I think as the Town
 
00:51:25.230 --> 00:51:25.240 align:start position:0%
Administrator stated um it really helps
 
00:51:27.109 --> 00:51:27.119 align:start position:0%
when you have both a law enfor M but
 
00:51:28.910 --> 00:51:28.920 align:start position:0%
also a regulatory approach and I think
 
00:51:30.349 --> 00:51:30.359 align:start position:0%
that's something we should continue to
 
00:51:33.109 --> 00:51:33.119 align:start position:0%
explore um I know in the past and I have
 
00:51:34.789 --> 00:51:34.799 align:start position:0%
copies of the bills from a couple of
 
00:51:36.589 --> 00:51:36.599 align:start position:0%
years ago there's been the effort for
 
00:51:39.230 --> 00:51:39.240 align:start position:0%
the lenser piece I think while I agree
 
00:51:41.069 --> 00:51:41.079 align:start position:0%
or understand where we don't want to
 
00:51:43.589 --> 00:51:43.599 align:start position:0%
make the oplc another law enforcement
 
00:51:46.150 --> 00:51:46.160 align:start position:0%
agency the ability to regulate and just
 
00:51:48.309 --> 00:51:48.319 align:start position:0%
be able to go in and say hey you're not
 
00:51:49.870 --> 00:51:49.880 align:start position:0%
in compliance with all of these Health
 
00:51:52.470 --> 00:51:52.480 align:start position:0%
codes um the people in this don't
 
00:51:55.670 --> 00:51:55.680 align:start position:0%
actually have licenses can help add um a
 
00:51:57.910 --> 00:51:57.920 align:start position:0%
level of insance uring that all of these
 
00:51:59.109 --> 00:51:59.119 align:start position:0%
businesses are doing what they're
 
00:52:01.510 --> 00:52:01.520 align:start position:0%
supposed to be doing which is legitimate
 
00:52:04.829 --> 00:52:04.839 align:start position:0%
massage practices um and so I think
 
00:52:08.109 --> 00:52:08.119 align:start position:0%
right now um massage um these illicit
 
00:52:10.230 --> 00:52:10.240 align:start position:0%
businesses are only identified through
 
00:52:11.549 --> 00:52:11.559 align:start position:0%
complaints and reports to law
 
00:52:13.349 --> 00:52:13.359 align:start position:0%
enforcement and it and sometimes to the
 
00:52:16.030 --> 00:52:16.040 align:start position:0%
oplc but action cannot be taken unless
 
00:52:18.589 --> 00:52:18.599 align:start position:0%
those concerns are raised um is my
 
00:52:21.950 --> 00:52:21.960 align:start position:0%
understanding um but so page two um
 
00:52:24.390 --> 00:52:24.400 align:start position:0%
really speaks to an area in the
 
00:52:26.789 --> 00:52:26.799 align:start position:0%
prostitution statute that we can really
 
00:52:30.589 --> 00:52:30.599 align:start position:0%
focus on the business practice um and
 
00:52:32.470 --> 00:52:32.480 align:start position:0%
you know I understand I may not have
 
00:52:35.670 --> 00:52:35.680 align:start position:0%
written it correct um fully um but this
 
00:52:38.390 --> 00:52:38.400 align:start position:0%
was my attempt you mean in Legally in in
 
00:52:41.910 --> 00:52:41.920 align:start position:0%
Legally um my my uh non-existent law
 
00:52:44.190 --> 00:52:44.200 align:start position:0%
degree but I did my very best um to
 
00:52:46.510 --> 00:52:46.520 align:start position:0%
highlight the main issue which is
 
00:52:48.549 --> 00:52:48.559 align:start position:0%
paragraph e which is currently a
 
00:52:51.390 --> 00:52:51.400 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor um if we raised um it to a
 
00:52:54.030 --> 00:52:54.040 align:start position:0%
felony and then I I did note that there
 
00:52:57.390 --> 00:52:57.400 align:start position:0%
is already a clause about um involving
 
00:52:59.990 --> 00:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
uh minors and so I did bring that in if
 
00:53:02.789 --> 00:53:02.799 align:start position:0%
there was interest to also you know make
 
00:53:05.069 --> 00:53:05.079 align:start position:0%
that a more severe penalty again to give
 
00:53:07.750 --> 00:53:07.760 align:start position:0%
some more teeth um or we could just make
 
00:53:10.990 --> 00:53:11.000 align:start position:0%
it a felony and leave it at that um so I
 
00:53:12.670 --> 00:53:12.680 align:start position:0%
think there's some flexibility here but
 
00:53:14.470 --> 00:53:14.480 align:start position:0%
this is really what's been identified as
 
00:53:18.710 --> 00:53:18.720 align:start position:0%
the key way um to I address it um it's
 
00:53:21.750 --> 00:53:21.760 align:start position:0%
not you know creating a lot of felonies
 
00:53:23.510 --> 00:53:23.520 align:start position:0%
within the prostitution statute it's
 
00:53:25.630 --> 00:53:25.640 align:start position:0%
really narrowing in on that one piece
 
00:53:27.349 --> 00:53:27.359 align:start position:0%
that's been really
 
00:53:29.589 --> 00:53:29.599 align:start position:0%
challenging okay a couple things I think
 
00:53:32.270 --> 00:53:32.280 align:start position:0%
that we can um we can do two things so I
 
00:53:34.829 --> 00:53:34.839 align:start position:0%
think I I like the idea of creating a
 
00:53:37.190 --> 00:53:37.200 align:start position:0%
commission not a not a committee a
 
00:53:40.789 --> 00:53:40.799 align:start position:0%
commission and have it be broad so that
 
00:53:43.390 --> 00:53:43.400 align:start position:0%
it covers uh human trafficking period
 
00:53:45.789 --> 00:53:45.799 align:start position:0%
not just necessarily in this aspect but
 
00:53:48.549 --> 00:53:48.559 align:start position:0%
in all aspects because we're dealing
 
00:53:50.589 --> 00:53:50.599 align:start position:0%
with it on several levels dealing on
 
00:53:53.390 --> 00:53:53.400 align:start position:0%
immigration we're dealing with it on um
 
00:53:54.910 --> 00:53:54.920 align:start position:0%
you know missing children we're dealing
 
00:53:57.510 --> 00:53:57.520 align:start position:0%
with it in this and I I think that it's
 
00:54:00.309 --> 00:54:00.319 align:start position:0%
um it's worthy of having an ongoing uh
 
00:54:03.470 --> 00:54:03.480 align:start position:0%
commission that can keep track of the
 
00:54:05.829 --> 00:54:05.839 align:start position:0%
various changes going on in federal and
 
00:54:07.870 --> 00:54:07.880 align:start position:0%
state law and intelligence that's coming
 
00:54:10.069 --> 00:54:10.079 align:start position:0%
in so that we're Nimble enough to change
 
00:54:13.510 --> 00:54:13.520 align:start position:0%
our statutes as we need to um so I think
 
00:54:18.030 --> 00:54:18.040 align:start position:0%
that that's okay to do both I I think um
 
00:54:20.549 --> 00:54:20.559 align:start position:0%
we would definitely we like I think part
 
00:54:21.589 --> 00:54:21.599 align:start position:0%
of the reason we wanted to be
 
00:54:23.710 --> 00:54:23.720 align:start position:0%
hyperfocused on this particular issue is
 
00:54:25.030 --> 00:54:25.040 align:start position:0%
because there are a lot of different
 
00:54:27.309 --> 00:54:27.319 align:start position:0%
stakeholders and agencies that are
 
00:54:29.030 --> 00:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
trying to address it from multiple
 
00:54:32.150 --> 00:54:32.160 align:start position:0%
angles um and the task force like so New
 
00:54:34.030 --> 00:54:34.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire does already have a task force
 
00:54:36.430 --> 00:54:36.440 align:start position:0%
that is multi-disciplinary and has you
 
00:54:38.910 --> 00:54:38.920 align:start position:0%
know Homeland Security folks prosecutors
 
00:54:41.430 --> 00:54:41.440 align:start position:0%
crisis center Advocates and so on so I
 
00:54:43.950 --> 00:54:43.960 align:start position:0%
just don't want to add take have
 
00:54:45.990 --> 00:54:46.000 align:start position:0%
parallel work from what the task force
 
00:54:47.589 --> 00:54:47.599 align:start position:0%
is already doing to address these things
 
00:54:50.589 --> 00:54:50.599 align:start position:0%
but I I hear what you're saying and yeah
 
00:54:52.630 --> 00:54:52.640 align:start position:0%
does the task force have anyone from the
 
00:54:54.510 --> 00:54:54.520 align:start position:0%
legislature involved in
 
00:54:56.829 --> 00:54:56.839 align:start position:0%
it not currently
 
00:54:58.670 --> 00:54:58.680 align:start position:0%
no but no so I think that's a do you
 
00:55:00.589 --> 00:55:00.599 align:start position:0%
want to speak to how they could join
 
00:55:02.670 --> 00:55:02.680 align:start position:0%
sure yeah it would be helpful just
 
00:55:04.349 --> 00:55:04.359 align:start position:0%
because we don't know what's going on so
 
00:55:06.230 --> 00:55:06.240 align:start position:0%
then we hear yeah I think that makes a
 
00:55:07.589 --> 00:55:07.599 align:start position:0%
lot of sense the task force is kind of
 
00:55:08.990 --> 00:55:09.000 align:start position:0%
in the process of restructuring I don't
 
00:55:10.510 --> 00:55:10.520 align:start position:0%
know how much members of this committee
 
00:55:13.910 --> 00:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
are aware um the taskforce as of this
 
00:55:15.549 --> 00:55:15.559 align:start position:0%
budget period is state funded rather
 
00:55:18.109 --> 00:55:18.119 align:start position:0%
than F funded by federal grants um and
 
00:55:19.510 --> 00:55:19.520 align:start position:0%
as part of that process the Attorney
 
00:55:21.309 --> 00:55:21.319 align:start position:0%
General commissioned um A needs
 
00:55:22.750 --> 00:55:22.760 align:start position:0%
assessment a Statewide needs assessment
 
00:55:24.789 --> 00:55:24.799 align:start position:0%
which has just completed uh so their
 
00:55:26.069 --> 00:55:26.079 align:start position:0%
office has seen the results of that we
 
00:55:29.390 --> 00:55:29.400 align:start position:0%
have not yet as a task force so we know
 
00:55:31.029 --> 00:55:31.039 align:start position:0%
we will likely be changing structure we
 
00:55:33.109 --> 00:55:33.119 align:start position:0%
don't quite know how yet um but we are
 
00:55:36.309 --> 00:55:36.319 align:start position:0%
certainly hoping for more buying from
 
00:55:38.150 --> 00:55:38.160 align:start position:0%
stakeholders at the state level now that
 
00:55:41.750 --> 00:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
we are a fully state funded and on top
 
00:55:44.349 --> 00:55:44.359 align:start position:0%
of that um Meg and other members of the
 
00:55:45.549 --> 00:55:45.559 align:start position:0%
task force have been working with the
 
00:55:46.910 --> 00:55:46.920 align:start position:0%
AG's office to create a human
 
00:55:49.589 --> 00:55:49.599 align:start position:0%
trafficking uh protocol in the state so
 
00:55:52.309 --> 00:55:52.319 align:start position:0%
that everyone could follow um when
 
00:55:54.510 --> 00:55:54.520 align:start position:0%
addressing these cases so I think the
 
00:55:56.710 --> 00:55:56.720 align:start position:0%
hesitancy is not because we don't report
 
00:55:58.510 --> 00:55:58.520 align:start position:0%
looking into this issue but we know that
 
00:56:00.190 --> 00:56:00.200 align:start position:0%
there's a few moving pieces right now
 
00:56:02.750 --> 00:56:02.760 align:start position:0%
that might lend itself to helping shape
 
00:56:04.829 --> 00:56:04.839 align:start position:0%
future legislation on a larger like on a
 
00:56:06.069 --> 00:56:06.079 align:start position:0%
bigger picture I'm just trying to
 
00:56:07.510 --> 00:56:07.520 align:start position:0%
balance the difference between a
 
00:56:09.150 --> 00:56:09.160 align:start position:0%
commission and a committee got and a
 
00:56:11.589 --> 00:56:11.599 align:start position:0%
commission is an ongoing thing so if I
 
00:56:13.710 --> 00:56:13.720 align:start position:0%
if I just hyper focus it on this one
 
00:56:18.029 --> 00:56:18.039 align:start position:0%
issue it's kind of um that that's a not
 
00:56:19.829 --> 00:56:19.839 align:start position:0%
to make light of it but it's a small
 
00:56:22.630 --> 00:56:22.640 align:start position:0%
issue for an ongoing thing that has no
 
00:56:24.630 --> 00:56:24.640 align:start position:0%
end so I could do a commission with an
 
00:56:26.870 --> 00:56:26.880 align:start position:0%
end date of two years or something like
 
00:56:28.630 --> 00:56:28.640 align:start position:0%
that if we're going to hyperfocus it and
 
00:56:30.029 --> 00:56:30.039 align:start position:0%
then I think because I think that could
 
00:56:32.390 --> 00:56:32.400 align:start position:0%
help leverage some of the conversations
 
00:56:33.670 --> 00:56:33.680 align:start position:0%
that are already happening within the
 
00:56:35.990 --> 00:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
task force and these other agencies and
 
00:56:37.990 --> 00:56:38.000 align:start position:0%
I have a question about massage um
 
00:56:40.230 --> 00:56:40.240 align:start position:0%
licensing and I know it's probably not
 
00:56:42.069 --> 00:56:42.079 align:start position:0%
your expertise but maybe you've picked
 
00:56:44.789 --> 00:56:44.799 align:start position:0%
it up in dealing with this each of the
 
00:56:47.190 --> 00:56:47.200 align:start position:0%
individual massage therapists are
 
00:56:49.670 --> 00:56:49.680 align:start position:0%
supposed to be licensed correct I
 
00:56:51.750 --> 00:56:51.760 align:start position:0%
believe that's correct Pamela yes but
 
00:56:53.510 --> 00:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
the business but the business overall is
 
00:56:56.470 --> 00:56:56.480 align:start position:0%
not yes that is that's correct and that
 
00:56:58.109 --> 00:56:58.119 align:start position:0%
so that's the kind of the Crux of the
 
00:57:01.029 --> 00:57:01.039 align:start position:0%
issue is that um in New Hampshire some
 
00:57:03.589 --> 00:57:03.599 align:start position:0%
um bit like some uh professions have to
 
00:57:05.270 --> 00:57:05.280 align:start position:0%
be both individually licensed and then
 
00:57:07.270 --> 00:57:07.280 align:start position:0%
the establishment is licensed but in New
 
00:57:10.309 --> 00:57:10.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it the establishment isn't but
 
00:57:13.349 --> 00:57:13.359 align:start position:0%
individuals are um for massage and like
 
00:57:15.829 --> 00:57:15.839 align:start position:0%
other Body Works um and so that's sort
 
00:57:17.270 --> 00:57:17.280 align:start position:0%
of what we're trying
 
00:57:20.670 --> 00:57:20.680 align:start position:0%
to kind of regulate a little bit because
 
00:57:22.870 --> 00:57:22.880 align:start position:0%
uh sometimes the people who are
 
00:57:24.710 --> 00:57:24.720 align:start position:0%
operating in these illicit businesses
 
00:57:25.750 --> 00:57:25.760 align:start position:0%
aren't actually the ones that are
 
00:57:25.760 --> 00:57:26.710 align:start position:0%
aren't actually the ones that are
licensed

00:57:26.710 --> 00:57:26.720 align:start position:0%
licensed
 
00:57:29.230 --> 00:57:29.240 align:start position:0%
and so and then it just it doesn't
 
00:57:30.789 --> 00:57:30.799 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm assuming I understand
 
00:57:32.309 --> 00:57:32.319 align:start position:0%
that they I mean it's not an easy
 
00:57:34.470 --> 00:57:34.480 align:start position:0%
license to get or maintain I think they
 
00:57:36.349 --> 00:57:36.359 align:start position:0%
continuing ed classes and all kinds of
 
00:57:38.710 --> 00:57:38.720 align:start position:0%
things so I'm assuming that these people
 
00:57:40.150 --> 00:57:40.160 align:start position:0%
that are in here that are rotating
 
00:57:43.589 --> 00:57:43.599 align:start position:0%
around aren't licensed therapists so as
 
00:57:45.630 --> 00:57:45.640 align:start position:0%
oplc unable to go in there and check
 
00:57:45.640 --> 00:57:46.990 align:start position:0%
oplc unable to go in there and check
their

00:57:46.990 --> 00:57:47.000 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:57:49.549 --> 00:57:49.559 align:start position:0%
licenses or or the local Health
 
00:57:51.829 --> 00:57:51.839 align:start position:0%
Department yeah I could definitely I
 
00:57:53.829 --> 00:57:53.839 align:start position:0%
know they've testified in the past on
 
00:57:56.390 --> 00:57:56.400 align:start position:0%
the establishment piece um so I could
 
00:57:58.270 --> 00:57:58.280 align:start position:0%
look back at their past testimony just
 
00:58:00.270 --> 00:58:00.280 align:start position:0%
to see where they're coming from that
 
00:58:03.990 --> 00:58:04.000 align:start position:0%
angle um but I I think I think there's a
 
00:58:06.230 --> 00:58:06.240 align:start position:0%
there's a little bit of a disconnect
 
00:58:07.870 --> 00:58:07.880 align:start position:0%
about like actually being able to go in
 
00:58:10.990 --> 00:58:11.000 align:start position:0%
and and regulate the business and versus
 
00:58:12.870 --> 00:58:12.880 align:start position:0%
the license of the individuals
 
00:58:14.190 --> 00:58:14.200 align:start position:0%
representative Ro did you have something
 
00:58:15.349 --> 00:58:15.359 align:start position:0%
to add to this because I know you looked
 
00:58:17.990 --> 00:58:18.000 align:start position:0%
at this and worked on this
 
00:58:20.950 --> 00:58:20.960 align:start position:0%
before thank you Mr chairman I I I think
 
00:58:22.950 --> 00:58:22.960 align:start position:0%
I do
 
00:58:26.270 --> 00:58:26.280 align:start position:0%
so okay so in the committee when when we
 
00:58:29.430 --> 00:58:29.440 align:start position:0%
heard the comment that was made that
 
00:58:32.630 --> 00:58:32.640 align:start position:0%
well maybe a landlord could say if you
 
00:58:34.990 --> 00:58:35.000 align:start position:0%
don't like basically saying that you
 
00:58:36.230 --> 00:58:36.240 align:start position:0%
like you have to let them in or else
 
00:58:37.710 --> 00:58:37.720 align:start position:0%
we're going to like terminate your lease
 
00:58:40.150 --> 00:58:40.160 align:start position:0%
or whatever that that would be that
 
00:58:42.109 --> 00:58:42.119 align:start position:0%
would be like a no starter right you
 
00:58:44.190 --> 00:58:44.200 align:start position:0%
can't a landlord can't say what the
 
00:58:45.109 --> 00:58:45.119 align:start position:0%
tenant has to do if it's
 
00:58:46.510 --> 00:58:46.520 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional like you just can't let
 
00:58:47.630 --> 00:58:47.640 align:start position:0%
somebody come into your business you're
 
00:58:48.750 --> 00:58:48.760 align:start position:0%
going to lose your
 
00:58:53.870 --> 00:58:53.880 align:start position:0%
lease however so if the if the if the
 
00:58:56.549 --> 00:58:56.559 align:start position:0%
employees are supposed to be licensed
 
00:58:58.150 --> 00:58:58.160 align:start position:0%
and have a license on the wall that
 
00:58:59.829 --> 00:58:59.839 align:start position:0%
they're identified as that particular
 
00:59:03.910 --> 00:59:03.920 align:start position:0%
person right if if the state has the
 
00:59:06.549 --> 00:59:06.559 align:start position:0%
ability to go in and do a you know a
 
00:59:08.549 --> 00:59:08.559 align:start position:0%
spot check per se which now they don't
 
00:59:11.150 --> 00:59:11.160 align:start position:0%
have the ability to do that then that
 
00:59:13.190 --> 00:59:13.200 align:start position:0%
would be one thing right if there's 20
 
00:59:14.990 --> 00:59:15.000 align:start position:0%
people here and there's only seven
 
00:59:16.670 --> 00:59:16.680 align:start position:0%
people's names up on the wall there's
 
00:59:18.510 --> 00:59:18.520 align:start position:0%
there's clearly an issue right there
 
00:59:22.230 --> 00:59:22.240 align:start position:0%
right and then additionally
 
00:59:25.430 --> 00:59:25.440 align:start position:0%
if if it was where all right you're
 
00:59:26.589 --> 00:59:26.599 align:start position:0%
licensed for
 
00:59:29.789 --> 00:59:29.799 align:start position:0%
this location not this location right so
 
00:59:31.430 --> 00:59:31.440 align:start position:0%
if it's the thought of well I'm just
 
00:59:32.589 --> 00:59:32.599 align:start position:0%
going to pack up in the middle of the
 
00:59:34.109 --> 00:59:34.119 align:start position:0%
night and go to another location because
 
00:59:36.630 --> 00:59:36.640 align:start position:0%
they're on to me for lack of better word
 
00:59:38.029 --> 00:59:38.039 align:start position:0%
that would prevent that because you're
 
00:59:40.309 --> 00:59:40.319 align:start position:0%
only allowed to be right here and if you
 
00:59:42.829 --> 00:59:42.839 align:start position:0%
want to go there then that establishment
 
00:59:44.630 --> 00:59:44.640 align:start position:0%
would have to be inspected per se before
 
00:59:46.710 --> 00:59:46.720 align:start position:0%
it could be opened right it would that
 
00:59:49.670 --> 00:59:49.680 align:start position:0%
be like the general idea of and then by
 
00:59:52.190 --> 00:59:52.200 align:start position:0%
the time you catch on they Peck up and
 
00:59:54.549 --> 00:59:54.559 align:start position:0%
they're gone or they're shipped
 
00:59:57.190 --> 00:59:57.200 align:start position:0%
someplace else right yeah and I think I
 
00:59:58.630 --> 00:59:58.640 align:start position:0%
just wanted to Circle back too that you
 
01:00:00.829 --> 01:00:00.839 align:start position:0%
know as far as the individual lure I
 
01:00:02.990 --> 01:00:03.000 align:start position:0%
think that comes again back to the issue
 
01:00:04.870 --> 01:00:04.880 align:start position:0%
of then the infraction is on that
 
01:00:08.069 --> 01:00:08.079 align:start position:0%
individual massage therapist who likely
 
01:00:10.309 --> 01:00:10.319 align:start position:0%
is a victim of trafficking so I think
 
01:00:12.990 --> 01:00:13.000 align:start position:0%
that's a big part of it for us and so I
 
01:00:14.829 --> 01:00:14.839 align:start position:0%
think part of it is like really holding
 
01:00:16.549 --> 01:00:16.559 align:start position:0%
the business like the people operating
 
01:00:18.470 --> 01:00:18.480 align:start position:0%
them accountable well in other words you
 
01:00:20.870 --> 01:00:20.880 align:start position:0%
can charge the the person running the
 
01:00:23.510 --> 01:00:23.520 align:start position:0%
business with hiring unlicensed
 
01:00:26.309 --> 01:00:26.319 align:start position:0%
therapists versus going after the
 
01:00:28.670 --> 01:00:28.680 align:start position:0%
therapist and as far as limiting the
 
01:00:31.430 --> 01:00:31.440 align:start position:0%
licenses to geography that would be
 
01:00:33.270 --> 01:00:33.280 align:start position:0%
problematic because you can't say you're
 
01:00:36.190 --> 01:00:36.200 align:start position:0%
only licensed in this town but I believe
 
01:00:37.470 --> 01:00:37.480 align:start position:0%
we could
 
01:00:39.910 --> 01:00:39.920 align:start position:0%
enable enable um
 
01:00:42.470 --> 01:00:42.480 align:start position:0%
municipalities to require some type of
 
01:00:44.470 --> 01:00:44.480 align:start position:0%
either licensing or registration for
 
01:00:46.510 --> 01:00:46.520 align:start position:0%
them to operate in the in the so that
 
01:00:48.349 --> 01:00:48.359 align:start position:0%
their health department could
 
01:00:50.870 --> 01:00:50.880 align:start position:0%
theoretically get involved and go check
 
01:00:53.029 --> 01:00:53.039 align:start position:0%
licenses as well so there's several
 
01:00:54.910 --> 01:00:54.920 align:start position:0%
levels that we could look at this film
 
01:01:04.390 --> 01:01:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:07.990 --> 01:01:08.000 align:start position:0%
question one could write a statute that
 
01:01:12.750 --> 01:01:12.760 align:start position:0%
um that with language that uh uh puts a
 
01:01:16.309 --> 01:01:16.319 align:start position:0%
burden on a landlord uh that one way to
 
01:01:19.230 --> 01:01:19.240 align:start position:0%
do it I mean there's cases out there
 
01:01:21.230 --> 01:01:21.240 align:start position:0%
that talks about charging a landlord as
 
01:01:24.470 --> 01:01:24.480 align:start position:0%
an accomplice uh and and really what
 
01:01:27.910 --> 01:01:27.920 align:start position:0%
matters there is their mental state so
 
01:01:30.309 --> 01:01:30.319 align:start position:0%
yeah you know if uh you could write a
 
01:01:33.990 --> 01:01:34.000 align:start position:0%
statute such that uh if they uh if they
 
01:01:37.510 --> 01:01:37.520 align:start position:0%
were aware of what's going on uh that it
 
01:01:39.430 --> 01:01:39.440 align:start position:0%
they could be charged as an accomplice
 
01:01:41.190 --> 01:01:41.200 align:start position:0%
that's really not hard to write the
 
01:01:43.230 --> 01:01:43.240 align:start position:0%
issue is could would you want to put in
 
01:01:45.910 --> 01:01:45.920 align:start position:0%
that statute an obligation on their part
 
01:01:49.910 --> 01:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
to uh know what's going on so that
 
01:01:52.630 --> 01:01:52.640 align:start position:0%
that's the soft spot on that second um
 
01:01:56.950 --> 01:01:56.960 align:start position:0%
you know oplc as a general matter is uh
 
01:01:58.789 --> 01:01:58.799 align:start position:0%
and I don't mean this in a negative way
 
01:02:03.230 --> 01:02:03.240 align:start position:0%
but they're a a passive operation they
 
01:02:06.430 --> 01:02:06.440 align:start position:0%
take licenses away when somebody reports
 
01:02:10.230 --> 01:02:10.240 align:start position:0%
a violation to them they've never done
 
01:02:12.910 --> 01:02:12.920 align:start position:0%
investigations on their own they
 
01:02:15.309 --> 01:02:15.319 align:start position:0%
proactively they just don't that's not
 
01:02:17.950 --> 01:02:17.960 align:start position:0%
what they've done historically and God
 
01:02:19.470 --> 01:02:19.480 align:start position:0%
knows they don't have the resources to
 
01:02:22.510 --> 01:02:22.520 align:start position:0%
do that uh last thing have have you all
 
01:02:24.309 --> 01:02:24.319 align:start position:0%
talked to Homeland Security I was just
 
01:02:26.069 --> 01:02:26.079 align:start position:0%
going to circle back to that yes so we
 
01:02:27.990 --> 01:02:28.000 align:start position:0%
work closely on the task force with the
 
01:02:30.630 --> 01:02:30.640 align:start position:0%
the homeland security officers they were
 
01:02:32.549 --> 01:02:32.559 align:start position:0%
uh would have liked to be here today um
 
01:02:34.190 --> 01:02:34.200 align:start position:0%
one of them has just started a new Chief
 
01:02:36.430 --> 01:02:36.440 align:start position:0%
role in New Durham so he's busy with
 
01:02:38.109 --> 01:02:38.119 align:start position:0%
that and the other's on a pre-arranged
 
01:02:40.870 --> 01:02:40.880 align:start position:0%
uh vacation but this the second page of
 
01:02:43.029 --> 01:02:43.039 align:start position:0%
what Pamela has provided is really what
 
01:02:44.870 --> 01:02:44.880 align:start position:0%
um Task Force officer Mal was speaking
 
01:02:47.430 --> 01:02:47.440 align:start position:0%
to the most with us as far as the
 
01:02:51.710 --> 01:02:51.720 align:start position:0%
challenge of a this being uh the kind of
 
01:02:53.750 --> 01:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
ownership or control of the
 
01:02:55.950 --> 01:02:55.960 align:start position:0%
establishment being a felony in
 
01:02:57.710 --> 01:02:57.720 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and not here so seeing
 
01:03:00.150 --> 01:03:00.160 align:start position:0%
that influx he also did speak to the
 
01:03:02.109 --> 01:03:02.119 align:start position:0%
challenge of that knowingly piece we had
 
01:03:05.230 --> 01:03:05.240 align:start position:0%
a look and the other standards don't
 
01:03:07.549 --> 01:03:07.559 align:start position:0%
seem like they fit any better there for
 
01:03:10.109 --> 01:03:10.119 align:start position:0%
that I'm not sure yeah and and that's a
 
01:03:12.230 --> 01:03:12.240 align:start position:0%
matter that's a just to follow up on
 
01:03:14.190 --> 01:03:14.200 align:start position:0%
that in one more piece you know that's a
 
01:03:15.789 --> 01:03:15.799 align:start position:0%
matter of the word we put in there I
 
01:03:18.150 --> 01:03:18.160 align:start position:0%
mean we can charge we can say that a
 
01:03:19.910 --> 01:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
landlord is accomplice if they act
 
01:03:23.870 --> 01:03:23.880 align:start position:0%
recklessly that they you know they
 
01:03:28.870 --> 01:03:28.880 align:start position:0%
don't yeah there's language um
 
01:03:31.470 --> 01:03:31.480 align:start position:0%
um I had another brilliant point but I
 
01:03:33.950 --> 01:03:33.960 align:start position:0%
forgot yeah we would definitely be
 
01:03:36.190 --> 01:03:36.200 align:start position:0%
amendable if there was a different word
 
01:03:39.029 --> 01:03:39.039 align:start position:0%
than knowingly um like what um
 
01:03:41.109 --> 01:03:41.119 align:start position:0%
representative Sher is saying so we
 
01:03:43.430 --> 01:03:43.440 align:start position:0%
we're flexible with that piece of it I
 
01:03:46.349 --> 01:03:46.359 align:start position:0%
had a a question for the town of
 
01:03:49.230 --> 01:03:49.240 align:start position:0%
Derry you I'm just trying to brainstorm
 
01:03:50.789 --> 01:03:50.799 align:start position:0%
ways that did you hear what I had
 
01:03:53.710 --> 01:03:53.720 align:start position:0%
mentioned about a local um some type of
 
01:03:55.950 --> 01:03:55.960 align:start position:0%
local license or registration for or
 
01:03:58.630 --> 01:03:58.640 align:start position:0%
massage therapist if we were to empower
 
01:04:01.630 --> 01:04:01.640 align:start position:0%
municipality to to enable that something
 
01:04:03.309 --> 01:04:03.319 align:start position:0%
where your health department could go in
 
01:04:06.910 --> 01:04:06.920 align:start position:0%
and check licenses um whereas oplc
 
01:04:09.069 --> 01:04:09.079 align:start position:0%
doesn't have the Staffing or or the time
 
01:04:09.079 --> 01:04:10.309 align:start position:0%
doesn't have the Staffing or or the time
or

01:04:10.309 --> 01:04:10.319 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:04:12.390 --> 01:04:12.400 align:start position:0%
expertise thank you represent we do have
 
01:04:14.269 --> 01:04:14.279 align:start position:0%
a full-time Health officer in Derry so
 
01:04:16.109 --> 01:04:16.119 align:start position:0%
that would help dery itself I just don't
 
01:04:17.829 --> 01:04:17.839 align:start position:0%
know how many communities help full-time
 
01:04:19.549 --> 01:04:19.559 align:start position:0%
Health officers yeah no it would be it
 
01:04:21.390 --> 01:04:21.400 align:start position:0%
would be an option not a mandate so it
 
01:04:26.430 --> 01:04:26.440 align:start position:0%
would be a tool um maybe that would help
 
01:04:28.670 --> 01:04:28.680 align:start position:0%
yeah yes I remember my other brilliant
 
01:04:31.670 --> 01:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
Point um it would be helpful regardless
 
01:04:33.829 --> 01:04:33.839 align:start position:0%
of what else happens that that the task
 
01:04:37.069 --> 01:04:37.079 align:start position:0%
force consider having a legislator on
 
01:04:40.990 --> 01:04:41.000 align:start position:0%
there because it it it really uh it
 
01:04:43.510 --> 01:04:43.520 align:start position:0%
improves the flow from what the task
 
01:04:46.230 --> 01:04:46.240 align:start position:0%
force doing ideas that come up to what
 
01:04:48.750 --> 01:04:48.760 align:start position:0%
we we are trying to do
 
01:04:50.910 --> 01:04:50.920 align:start position:0%
here yeah so if you want to drop that in
 
01:04:52.789 --> 01:04:52.799 align:start position:0%
somebody's ear that might be that's the
 
01:04:55.029 --> 01:04:55.039 align:start position:0%
somebody it's it's in your ear you did
 
01:04:57.670 --> 01:04:57.680 align:start position:0%
it very good thank you all right anyone
 
01:04:59.430 --> 01:04:59.440 align:start position:0%
else want to address us on this I think
 
01:05:00.710 --> 01:05:00.720 align:start position:0%
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
 
01:05:03.710 --> 01:05:03.720 align:start position:0%
start a craft um I'm going to craft a a
 
01:05:05.829 --> 01:05:05.839 align:start position:0%
a white a sheet and we'll we'll start
 
01:05:07.549 --> 01:05:07.559 align:start position:0%
circulating and see what we can get for
 
01:05:10.109 --> 01:05:10.119 align:start position:0%
ideas and we'll uh I'll set a date we'll
 
01:05:13.549 --> 01:05:13.559 align:start position:0%
come back in uh in a couple weeks and
 
01:05:16.109 --> 01:05:16.119 align:start position:0%
um let you know where we're at and be
 
01:05:18.430 --> 01:05:18.440 align:start position:0%
prepared to submit to the full committee
 
01:05:21.470 --> 01:05:21.480 align:start position:0%
uh a piece of legislation yeah we just
 
01:05:23.670 --> 01:05:23.680 align:start position:0%
really appreciate your dedication to
 
01:05:26.230 --> 01:05:26.240 align:start position:0%
this because it really needs to be and
 
01:05:28.829 --> 01:05:28.839 align:start position:0%
we were really hoping that we wouldn't
 
01:05:30.589 --> 01:05:30.599 align:start position:0%
spend another year studying without
 
01:05:32.309 --> 01:05:32.319 align:start position:0%
taking at least some action so we're
 
01:05:33.910 --> 01:05:33.920 align:start position:0%
just really grateful for all of your
 
01:05:36.029 --> 01:05:36.039 align:start position:0%
consideration I I dislike study
 
01:05:38.230 --> 01:05:38.240 align:start position:0%
committees because they just don't have
 
01:05:40.549 --> 01:05:40.559 align:start position:0%
the time to do anything when you look at
 
01:05:42.670 --> 01:05:42.680 align:start position:0%
it logistically they don't finish and
 
01:05:44.430 --> 01:05:44.440 align:start position:0%
get ready to start their work until
 
01:05:45.750 --> 01:05:45.760 align:start position:0%
September and they only have till
 
01:05:48.069 --> 01:05:48.079 align:start position:0%
November and I just don't feel like that
 
01:05:50.789 --> 01:05:50.799 align:start position:0%
lends itself to a good work product and
 
01:05:52.750 --> 01:05:52.760 align:start position:0%
um I don't think the speaker likes them
 
01:05:55.029 --> 01:05:55.039 align:start position:0%
either so we're going to we're going to
 
01:05:57.549 --> 01:05:57.559 align:start position:0%
come up with some actual legislation um
 
01:05:59.069 --> 01:05:59.079 align:start position:0%
if anyone wants to reach out to me in
 
01:06:00.349 --> 01:06:00.359 align:start position:0%
the meantime if they have another
 
01:06:02.750 --> 01:06:02.760 align:start position:0%
brilliant idea or thought um you you
 
01:06:05.390 --> 01:06:05.400 align:start position:0%
know how to get in touch with me um so
 
01:06:06.750 --> 01:06:06.760 align:start position:0%
um just keep your eyes peeled for when
 
01:06:08.589 --> 01:06:08.599 align:start position:0%
the next meeting is if you want to come
 
01:06:10.470 --> 01:06:10.480 align:start position:0%
and uh we'll we'll hopefully have a
 
01:06:12.750 --> 01:06:12.760 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation thank you and with
 
01:06:15.510 --> 01:06:15.520 align:start position:0%
that I close that one and the next one
 
01:06:19.230 --> 01:06:19.240 align:start position:0%
I'm reopening is yeah I racist it what
 
01:06:23.950 --> 01:06:23.960 align:start position:0%
is it um 257 um reopening House Bill 257
 
01:06:30.670 --> 01:06:30.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:41.230 --> 01:06:41.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:43.950 --> 01:06:43.960 align:start position:0%
yeah okay so when we last left off uh
 
01:06:45.789 --> 01:06:45.799 align:start position:0%
representative Sher had proposed a
 
01:06:48.870 --> 01:06:48.880 align:start position:0%
change to RSA
 
01:06:51.470 --> 01:06:51.480 align:start position:0%
6393 and we were interested in actually
 
01:06:53.549 --> 01:06:53.559 align:start position:0%
running this by the County
 
01:06:56.750 --> 01:06:56.760 align:start position:0%
attorneys I think that that's a a
 
01:07:00.230 --> 01:07:00.240 align:start position:0%
capital idea um and if they think that
 
01:07:02.510 --> 01:07:02.520 align:start position:0%
that would accomplish it that would be
 
01:07:05.910 --> 01:07:05.920 align:start position:0%
much simpler and cleaner
 
01:07:07.910 --> 01:07:07.920 align:start position:0%
so yeah I was hoping they were going to
 
01:07:10.589 --> 01:07:10.599 align:start position:0%
be here are we early
 
01:07:12.750 --> 01:07:12.760 align:start position:0%
noly to start at
 
01:07:16.670 --> 01:07:16.680 align:start position:0%
11: what time is it 10:33
 
01:07:20.510 --> 01:07:20.520 align:start position:0%
105 I'm on a different time zone I know
 
01:07:22.630 --> 01:07:22.640 align:start position:0%
all right so the the the hearing that I
 
01:07:24.390 --> 01:07:24.400 align:start position:0%
opened an hour early I'm going to recess
 
01:07:54.430 --> 01:07:54.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:54.440 --> 01:08:24.430 align:start position:0%

e

01:30:52.910 --> 01:30:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:48.629 --> 01:31:48.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:51.030 --> 01:31:51.040 align:start position:0%
reopening the subcommittee work session
 
01:31:54.590 --> 01:31:54.600 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 257
 
01:31:57.189 --> 01:31:57.199 align:start position:0%
and I believe we wanted to hear from the
 
01:31:57.199 --> 01:32:02.149 align:start position:0%
and I believe we wanted to hear from the
County

01:32:02.149 --> 01:32:02.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:04.430 --> 01:32:04.440 align:start position:0%
attorneys it's my understanding there's
 
01:32:08.270 --> 01:32:08.280 align:start position:0%
a a a bill very similar in in the Senate
 
01:32:10.510 --> 01:32:10.520 align:start position:0%
right now
 
01:32:12.669 --> 01:32:12.679 align:start position:0%
um and I was wondering what your
 
01:32:19.750 --> 01:32:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:22.270 --> 01:32:22.280 align:start position:0%
that I've looked at that previously I
 
01:32:23.669 --> 01:32:23.679 align:start position:0%
don't have it in front of me so I don't
 
01:32:25.590 --> 01:32:25.600 align:start position:0%
have the direct language so it's hard to
 
01:32:27.910 --> 01:32:27.920 align:start position:0%
to make an intelligent conversation uh
 
01:32:30.229 --> 01:32:30.239 align:start position:0%
but based on just speaking with the
 
01:32:32.629 --> 01:32:32.639 align:start position:0%
office of the the child guardian I think
 
01:32:33.990 --> 01:32:34.000 align:start position:0%
part of the problem is there's not a
 
01:32:35.990 --> 01:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
mental state in there and I think even
 
01:32:38.229 --> 01:32:38.239 align:start position:0%
that and representative Shear's proposed
 
01:32:40.070 --> 01:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
amendment to changing the endangering
 
01:32:42.950 --> 01:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
the welfare it put default to a knowing
 
01:32:44.830 --> 01:32:44.840 align:start position:0%
mental state and a lot of the conduct
 
01:32:47.590 --> 01:32:47.600 align:start position:0%
we're looking to address here is not a
 
01:32:49.709 --> 01:32:49.719 align:start position:0%
knowing mental state it's not someone
 
01:32:51.950 --> 01:32:51.960 align:start position:0%
who has an idea that their actions are
 
01:32:54.709 --> 01:32:54.719 align:start position:0%
going to cause this result m M and so I
 
01:32:56.310 --> 01:32:56.320 align:start position:0%
think we're still going to end up in the
 
01:32:58.870 --> 01:32:58.880 align:start position:0%
same position where a lot of this
 
01:33:00.390 --> 01:33:00.400 align:start position:0%
conduct just falls through the cracks
 
01:33:04.229 --> 01:33:04.239 align:start position:0%
and yes changing it in 169c May mean
 
01:33:06.830 --> 01:33:06.840 align:start position:0%
that DCF has different Avenues to go
 
01:33:09.350 --> 01:33:09.360 align:start position:0%
down but it does not provide a law
 
01:33:11.189 --> 01:33:11.199 align:start position:0%
enforcement no it does not provide a law
 
01:33:13.310 --> 01:33:13.320 align:start position:0%
enforcement angle uh and so it sort of
 
01:33:16.149 --> 01:33:16.159 align:start position:0%
leaves us in a spot where we can't do
 
01:33:18.430 --> 01:33:18.440 align:start position:0%
anything and leaves us exactly where we
 
01:33:21.350 --> 01:33:21.360 align:start position:0%
are and to demonstrate the examples know
 
01:33:23.390 --> 01:33:23.400 align:start position:0%
the mental States for criminal are uh
 
01:33:25.229 --> 01:33:25.239 align:start position:0%
purpose knowingly recklessly and
 
01:33:26.830 --> 01:33:26.840 align:start position:0%
negligently knowingly would be a lot
 
01:33:28.790 --> 01:33:28.800 align:start position:0%
harder to prove obviously and if you
 
01:33:30.790 --> 01:33:30.800 align:start position:0%
have a situation where um a parent has
 
01:33:33.790 --> 01:33:33.800 align:start position:0%
left drugs out uh and a child inest said
 
01:33:36.109 --> 01:33:36.119 align:start position:0%
drugs and is seriously injured um that
 
01:33:38.109 --> 01:33:38.119 align:start position:0%
might be not a knowing mental state they
 
01:33:39.590 --> 01:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
might not have known that certain
 
01:33:42.430 --> 01:33:42.440 align:start position:0%
conduct would result as a as a result of
 
01:33:44.590 --> 01:33:44.600 align:start position:0%
their act so would that be negligence
 
01:33:46.270 --> 01:33:46.280 align:start position:0%
gross negligence exactly it would be
 
01:33:48.669 --> 01:33:48.679 align:start position:0%
negligence same with if you had a um
 
01:33:50.990 --> 01:33:51.000 align:start position:0%
significant other that you were aware of
 
01:33:53.990 --> 01:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
has a um a past behavior of sexually AB
 
01:33:55.149 --> 01:33:55.159 align:start position:0%
children you left them with your own
 
01:33:57.629 --> 01:33:57.639 align:start position:0%
children unattended you might not know
 
01:33:59.990 --> 01:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
that that conduct is going to result but
 
01:34:01.790 --> 01:34:01.800 align:start position:0%
if it does result it's because you took
 
01:34:04.030 --> 01:34:04.040 align:start position:0%
a substantial and unjustifiable risk
 
01:34:05.149 --> 01:34:05.159 align:start position:0%
that your child would be sexually
 
01:34:06.669 --> 01:34:06.679 align:start position:0%
assaulted and if in fact they were
 
01:34:08.070 --> 01:34:08.080 align:start position:0%
sexually assaulted that would be
 
01:34:11.270 --> 01:34:11.280 align:start position:0%
negligent and not knowingly okay um I I
 
01:34:13.669 --> 01:34:13.679 align:start position:0%
had another question with regard to our
 
01:34:16.350 --> 01:34:16.360 align:start position:0%
statutes around manslaughter I know a
 
01:34:19.390 --> 01:34:19.400 align:start position:0%
lot of states have uh a a depraved
 
01:34:21.629 --> 01:34:21.639 align:start position:0%
indifference standard for manslaughter
 
01:34:23.830 --> 01:34:23.840 align:start position:0%
in other words you leave out drugs you
 
01:34:26.189 --> 01:34:26.199 align:start position:0%
should have known um that shows depraved
 
01:34:27.669 --> 01:34:27.679 align:start position:0%
indifference do we have something like
 
01:34:30.510 --> 01:34:30.520 align:start position:0%
that how do how would you charge on on a
 
01:34:32.910 --> 01:34:32.920 align:start position:0%
case like that so that would be a
 
01:34:34.430 --> 01:34:34.440 align:start position:0%
negligent homicide so there's a
 
01:34:35.830 --> 01:34:35.840 align:start position:0%
manslaughter but there's also negligent
 
01:34:37.070 --> 01:34:37.080 align:start position:0%
homicide too I think that would more
 
01:34:38.870 --> 01:34:38.880 align:start position:0%
appropriately fit the uh negligent
 
01:34:41.109 --> 01:34:41.119 align:start position:0%
homicide standard um and it's a
 
01:34:42.990 --> 01:34:43.000 align:start position:0%
substantial and unjustifiable risk but
 
01:34:44.590 --> 01:34:44.600 align:start position:0%
like we talked about last week if you
 
01:34:46.550 --> 01:34:46.560 align:start position:0%
had a child that injested drugs that did
 
01:34:48.510 --> 01:34:48.520 align:start position:0%
not die yeah there would be no Avenue to
 
01:34:49.830 --> 01:34:49.840 align:start position:0%
charge that individual so they could
 
01:34:52.189 --> 01:34:52.199 align:start position:0%
have permanent brain damage Andre that
 
01:34:53.430 --> 01:34:53.440 align:start position:0%
person's not going to get charged
 
01:34:55.270 --> 01:34:55.280 align:start position:0%
correct we could kind of try to twist it
 
01:34:56.950 --> 01:34:56.960 align:start position:0%
to fit into a reckless conduct with a
 
01:34:59.070 --> 01:34:59.080 align:start position:0%
deadly weapon statute but whether or not
 
01:35:02.470 --> 01:35:02.480 align:start position:0%
drugs constitute a deadly weapon juries
 
01:35:04.030 --> 01:35:04.040 align:start position:0%
have trouble wrapping their brains
 
01:35:05.830 --> 01:35:05.840 align:start position:0%
around titles of stat they can see when
 
01:35:08.350 --> 01:35:08.360 align:start position:0%
you're walking on a tight rope yeah and
 
01:35:09.550 --> 01:35:09.560 align:start position:0%
that is something that's happening you
 
01:35:11.149 --> 01:35:11.159 align:start position:0%
way I there's a case for review in my
 
01:35:12.950 --> 01:35:12.960 align:start position:0%
office where just that happened a child
 
01:35:15.189 --> 01:35:15.199 align:start position:0%
ingested drugs ultimately that child was
 
01:35:18.030 --> 01:35:18.040 align:start position:0%
able to be revived and is largely okay
 
01:35:21.189 --> 01:35:21.199 align:start position:0%
but it does not fit really anywhere else
 
01:35:22.870 --> 01:35:22.880 align:start position:0%
unless we sort of strong arm it into a
 
01:35:24.950 --> 01:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
reckless conduct that weapon and I don't
 
01:35:26.830 --> 01:35:26.840 align:start position:0%
see that scenario fitting in The Knowing
 
01:35:28.950 --> 01:35:28.960 align:start position:0%
standard um for the amendment of
 
01:35:30.310 --> 01:35:30.320 align:start position:0%
endangering the welfare of a child that
 
01:35:33.350 --> 01:35:33.360 align:start position:0%
representative sure put forward uh or
 
01:35:36.750 --> 01:35:36.760 align:start position:0%
the uh amended I think it's s sp23 yes
 
01:35:39.310 --> 01:35:39.320 align:start position:0%
that's right oh that's helpful um and
 
01:35:41.149 --> 01:35:41.159 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't pertain to that fact
 
01:35:43.910 --> 01:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
pattern as well um and this is a knowing
 
01:35:46.070 --> 01:35:46.080 align:start position:0%
mental state it does it gets read of the
 
01:35:48.590 --> 01:35:48.600 align:start position:0%
word purposely uh so it is still a
 
01:35:50.510 --> 01:35:50.520 align:start position:0%
knowing mental state so it's very
 
01:35:52.510 --> 01:35:52.520 align:start position:0%
similar in that regard to representative
 
01:35:54.790 --> 01:35:54.800 align:start position:0%
Shear's amendment to and the state that
 
01:35:56.950 --> 01:35:56.960 align:start position:0%
you're looking for to be clear
 
01:36:00.350 --> 01:36:00.360 align:start position:0%
is we're looking the bill we proposed uh
 
01:36:04.709 --> 01:36:04.719 align:start position:0%
is a negligent NE okay would that apply
 
01:36:06.750 --> 01:36:06.760 align:start position:0%
we talk a lot about drugs um there's a
 
01:36:08.390 --> 01:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
lot of other scenarios like leaving a
 
01:36:10.430 --> 01:36:10.440 align:start position:0%
firearm around with would this be the
 
01:36:12.390 --> 01:36:12.400 align:start position:0%
same type of thing or having a dangerous
 
01:36:14.430 --> 01:36:14.440 align:start position:0%
animal that attack we've had several
 
01:36:15.830 --> 01:36:15.840 align:start position:0%
cases of children being attacked by
 
01:36:17.790 --> 01:36:17.800 align:start position:0%
dangerous animals that people possess
 
01:36:18.870 --> 01:36:18.880 align:start position:0%
same type of
 
01:36:20.870 --> 01:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
scenario uh yes I think so there's
 
01:36:22.109 --> 01:36:22.119 align:start position:0%
actually on the books a negligent
 
01:36:23.830 --> 01:36:23.840 align:start position:0%
storage of firearms that pertain to
 
01:36:25.270 --> 01:36:25.280 align:start position:0%
leaving a loaded firearm within a
 
01:36:29.430 --> 01:36:29.440 align:start position:0%
child's reach unlocked um if a child I
 
01:36:30.910 --> 01:36:30.920 align:start position:0%
could see a fact pattern in which you
 
01:36:33.030 --> 01:36:33.040 align:start position:0%
could fit that into um like a a child
 
01:36:34.910 --> 01:36:34.920 align:start position:0%
being around a firearm doesn't know how
 
01:36:37.229 --> 01:36:37.239 align:start position:0%
to use a firearm it's loaded is Gravely
 
01:36:39.189 --> 01:36:39.199 align:start position:0%
injured or injures a friend I think that
 
01:36:40.830 --> 01:36:40.840 align:start position:0%
would fit this particular fact pattern
 
01:36:41.629 --> 01:36:41.639 align:start position:0%
okay I'm just trying to think of
 
01:36:43.030 --> 01:36:43.040 align:start position:0%
different scenarios that would be caught
 
01:36:45.430 --> 01:36:45.440 align:start position:0%
into this okay was there anything else
 
01:36:47.270 --> 01:36:47.280 align:start position:0%
you wanted to tell us um I think we
 
01:36:50.189 --> 01:36:50.199 align:start position:0%
would just um like to emphasize that
 
01:36:52.629 --> 01:36:52.639 align:start position:0%
though there is a civil Avenue that's
 
01:36:54.910 --> 01:36:54.920 align:start position:0%
being sought by the um Office of the
 
01:36:57.189 --> 01:36:57.199 align:start position:0%
child advocate in DCF to amend that
 
01:36:59.189 --> 01:36:59.199 align:start position:0%
statute that that doesn't mean there
 
01:37:01.470 --> 01:37:01.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't need to be a criminal statute as
 
01:37:05.270 --> 01:37:05.280 align:start position:0%
well there's a lot of issues with uh how
 
01:37:08.910 --> 01:37:08.920 align:start position:0%
um the time frames for dcyf can prolong
 
01:37:10.910 --> 01:37:10.920 align:start position:0%
uh the situations where children's CH
 
01:37:13.390 --> 01:37:13.400 align:start position:0%
children are placed in danger where uh
 
01:37:14.669 --> 01:37:14.679 align:start position:0%
having an Avenue to charge somebody
 
01:37:16.830 --> 01:37:16.840 align:start position:0%
criminally gives us a lot of options as
 
01:37:19.070 --> 01:37:19.080 align:start position:0%
well for for helping and I think what we
 
01:37:20.470 --> 01:37:20.480 align:start position:0%
emphasized last week is this would be a
 
01:37:22.870 --> 01:37:22.880 align:start position:0%
deterrent and a big deterrent um for
 
01:37:25.510 --> 01:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
people to to um take I think you also
 
01:37:27.870 --> 01:37:27.880 align:start position:0%
testified last week that it it's not
 
01:37:30.030 --> 01:37:30.040 align:start position:0%
only about the the stick it's also a
 
01:37:32.830 --> 01:37:32.840 align:start position:0%
little bit of carrot as well as you can
 
01:37:35.470 --> 01:37:35.480 align:start position:0%
get them into the system and offer them
 
01:37:37.350 --> 01:37:37.360 align:start position:0%
exactly so for example in straford
 
01:37:39.229 --> 01:37:39.239 align:start position:0%
County um if we charge somebody with a
 
01:37:41.390 --> 01:37:41.400 align:start position:0%
crime and they are placed on bail we
 
01:37:43.350 --> 01:37:43.360 align:start position:0%
have a host of services that we can
 
01:37:45.229 --> 01:37:45.239 align:start position:0%
provide that individual on bail to not
 
01:37:46.550 --> 01:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
only make sure that they comply with
 
01:37:48.229 --> 01:37:48.239 align:start position:0%
their bail recommendations and not
 
01:37:50.030 --> 01:37:50.040 align:start position:0%
commit any other crimes but help them
 
01:37:51.990 --> 01:37:52.000 align:start position:0%
get mental health treatment drug uh
 
01:37:53.950 --> 01:37:53.960 align:start position:0%
substance abuse treatment all things
 
01:37:56.270 --> 01:37:56.280 align:start position:0%
that can help them um with their dcyf
 
01:37:59.030 --> 01:37:59.040 align:start position:0%
plan to reunify but also have a check on
 
01:38:00.390 --> 01:38:00.400 align:start position:0%
them to make sure they're doing it and
 
01:38:02.350 --> 01:38:02.360 align:start position:0%
have a supervisor assigned to make sure
 
01:38:03.950 --> 01:38:03.960 align:start position:0%
they're doing it who will inform the
 
01:38:05.629 --> 01:38:05.639 align:start position:0%
court immediately if they're not doing
 
01:38:08.589 --> 01:38:08.599 align:start position:0%
it um which can help us again protect uh
 
01:38:10.189 --> 01:38:10.199 align:start position:0%
the children that are hope hopefully not
 
01:38:11.629 --> 01:38:11.639 align:start position:0%
left in their care but it's sometimes
 
01:38:13.709 --> 01:38:13.719 align:start position:0%
left in their care okay thank you I
 
01:38:15.950 --> 01:38:15.960 align:start position:0%
would also uh just note to the extent
 
01:38:17.390 --> 01:38:17.400 align:start position:0%
that there are different definitions in
 
01:38:19.870 --> 01:38:19.880 align:start position:0%
one 169c versus the bill that's been put
 
01:38:21.550 --> 01:38:21.560 align:start position:0%
forward from our perspective that
 
01:38:24.470 --> 01:38:24.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't raise an issue uh
 
01:38:25.910 --> 01:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
prosecutors would be looking at the
 
01:38:27.470 --> 01:38:27.480 align:start position:0%
criminal definition and I would note
 
01:38:29.070 --> 01:38:29.080 align:start position:0%
that the definitions throughout the
 
01:38:31.750 --> 01:38:31.760 align:start position:0%
criminal code are inconsistent uh if you
 
01:38:34.589 --> 01:38:34.599 align:start position:0%
look at child under the sexual assault
 
01:38:36.390 --> 01:38:36.400 align:start position:0%
statute a child is defined as somebody
 
01:38:39.229 --> 01:38:39.239 align:start position:0%
under the age of 16 if you look at child
 
01:38:41.390 --> 01:38:41.400 align:start position:0%
under the child sexual abuse material
 
01:38:43.750 --> 01:38:43.760 align:start position:0%
child is defined as under 18 so there
 
01:38:45.910 --> 01:38:45.920 align:start position:0%
are inconsistent definitions for these
 
01:38:48.229 --> 01:38:48.239 align:start position:0%
words within the criminal code that we
 
01:38:49.830 --> 01:38:49.840 align:start position:0%
already every single time you go to
 
01:38:51.229 --> 01:38:51.239 align:start position:0%
charge something need to go back to the
 
01:38:53.070 --> 01:38:53.080 align:start position:0%
definitions and make sure you're within
 
01:38:55.070 --> 01:38:55.080 align:start position:0%
the process proper framework so to the
 
01:38:58.030 --> 01:38:58.040 align:start position:0%
extent that it's a different chapter of
 
01:39:00.470 --> 01:39:00.480 align:start position:0%
the statutes does not align perfectly
 
01:39:01.750 --> 01:39:01.760 align:start position:0%
with the criminal code I don't think
 
01:39:04.430 --> 01:39:04.440 align:start position:0%
that that's a significant concern well I
 
01:39:06.669 --> 01:39:06.679 align:start position:0%
I would suggest to you that if um you
 
01:39:08.470 --> 01:39:08.480 align:start position:0%
happen to have yourself a summer intern
 
01:39:09.950 --> 01:39:09.960 align:start position:0%
and you put them to work and give me a
 
01:39:11.830 --> 01:39:11.840 align:start position:0%
list of el those definitions you need to
 
01:39:13.950 --> 01:39:13.960 align:start position:0%
have fixed I'd be happy to submit a bill
 
01:39:17.149 --> 01:39:17.159 align:start position:0%
to do that thank you thank you yeah are
 
01:39:19.550 --> 01:39:19.560 align:start position:0%
there any questions from members that
 
01:39:21.550 --> 01:39:21.560 align:start position:0%
would like to ask to elucidate some
 
01:39:24.229 --> 01:39:24.239 align:start position:0%
information that we don't already know
 
01:39:26.870 --> 01:39:26.880 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much anyone
 
01:39:28.870 --> 01:39:28.880 align:start position:0%
else want to address the committee
 
01:39:31.910 --> 01:39:31.920 align:start position:0%

name is Alex Lee I'm the chief of police
 
01:39:43.270 --> 01:39:43.280 align:start position:0%
in Newport uh detective Marvin wanted to
 
01:39:45.589 --> 01:39:45.599 align:start position:0%
be here this morning but uh late last
 
01:39:47.709 --> 01:39:47.719 align:start position:0%
night he was uh involved in the arrest
 
01:39:50.189 --> 01:39:50.199 align:start position:0%
of a child protection child predator
 
01:39:52.790 --> 01:39:52.800 align:start position:0%
situation so uh I told him he needed to
 
01:39:55.750 --> 01:39:55.760 align:start position:0%
stay home get his work done but um I've
 
01:39:57.070 --> 01:39:57.080 align:start position:0%
been a police officer in New Hampshire

for 21 years I was a detective for the
 
01:40:01.870 --> 01:40:01.880 align:start position:0%
State Police um before going into local
 
01:40:04.350 --> 01:40:04.360 align:start position:0%
law enforcement and becoming a chief and
 
01:40:06.229 --> 01:40:06.239 align:start position:0%
my whole career I've specialized in
 
01:40:08.950 --> 01:40:08.960 align:start position:0%
child protection cases uh so I just
 
01:40:11.310 --> 01:40:11.320 align:start position:0%
wanted to reiterate uh my department and
 
01:40:14.470 --> 01:40:14.480 align:start position:0%
law enforcement support for this bill um
 
01:40:17.229 --> 01:40:17.239 align:start position:0%
I'm more than happy to work with members
 
01:40:18.470 --> 01:40:18.480 align:start position:0%
of the subcommittee or the full
 
01:40:21.070 --> 01:40:21.080 align:start position:0%
committee on uh the nitty-gritty details
 
01:40:22.950 --> 01:40:22.960 align:start position:0%
of the bill and any amendments that
 
01:40:25.750 --> 01:40:25.760 align:start position:0%
should be made to uh particular sections
 
01:40:28.910 --> 01:40:28.920 align:start position:0%
of the bill and um uh I'm a member of
 
01:40:31.470 --> 01:40:31.480 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General's uh sexual assault
 
01:40:33.510 --> 01:40:33.520 align:start position:0%
Advisory Board and we discuss bills like
 
01:40:35.550 --> 01:40:35.560 align:start position:0%
this as well as part of that board so
 
01:40:37.430 --> 01:40:37.440 align:start position:0%
I'm more than happy to to work with the
 
01:40:39.750 --> 01:40:39.760 align:start position:0%
committee on any questions you may have
 
01:40:41.589 --> 01:40:41.599 align:start position:0%
about uh different scenarios like you
 
01:40:43.589 --> 01:40:43.599 align:start position:0%
were presenting to the attorney and give
 
01:40:45.950 --> 01:40:45.960 align:start position:0%
a law enforcement perspective on that
 
01:40:48.229 --> 01:40:48.239 align:start position:0%
but uh I do think that it is critical
 
01:40:51.390 --> 01:40:51.400 align:start position:0%
that we that whatever uh bill is passed
 
01:40:54.830 --> 01:40:54.840 align:start position:0%
that it has a uh uh culpable mental
 
01:40:57.430 --> 01:40:57.440 align:start position:0%
state that is provable in these types of
 
01:40:59.990 --> 01:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
cases uh because if the culpable mental
 
01:41:02.910 --> 01:41:02.920 align:start position:0%
state is too high then uh I think the
 
01:41:05.390 --> 01:41:05.400 align:start position:0%
bill loses its purpose entirely because
 
01:41:07.870 --> 01:41:07.880 align:start position:0%
we just cannot use it so I would uh
 
01:41:10.270 --> 01:41:10.280 align:start position:0%
certainly support a a negligent mental
 
01:41:13.350 --> 01:41:13.360 align:start position:0%
state for these types of cases um and
 
01:41:14.669 --> 01:41:14.679 align:start position:0%
with that I'm happy to take any
 
01:41:16.750 --> 01:41:16.760 align:start position:0%
questions thank you um you mentioned you
 
01:41:18.270 --> 01:41:18.280 align:start position:0%
were on the Attorney General's task
 
01:41:20.229 --> 01:41:20.239 align:start position:0%
force and they looked at did they have a
 
01:41:21.870 --> 01:41:21.880 align:start position:0%
chance to take a look at this proposed
 
01:41:23.910 --> 01:41:23.920 align:start position:0%
legislation we have a meeting scheduled
 
01:41:26.350 --> 01:41:26.360 align:start position:0%
at 1:00 this afternoon so I'll be uh
 
01:41:28.270 --> 01:41:28.280 align:start position:0%
giving the board an update I'd be I'd be
 
01:41:30.229 --> 01:41:30.239 align:start position:0%
pleased to hear what the feedback is
 
01:41:31.790 --> 01:41:31.800 align:start position:0%
that you get um if you want to send it
 
01:41:33.750 --> 01:41:33.760 align:start position:0%
to my email that would be good so I can
 
01:41:34.870 --> 01:41:34.880 align:start position:0%
circulate it with the rest of the
 
01:41:36.709 --> 01:41:36.719 align:start position:0%
committee members I would be happy to do
 
01:41:38.229 --> 01:41:38.239 align:start position:0%
that sir thank you Chief any questions
 
01:41:39.109 --> 01:41:39.119 align:start position:0%
for the
 
01:41:41.629 --> 01:41:41.639 align:start position:0%
chief yes go
 
01:41:43.669 --> 01:41:43.679 align:start position:0%
ahead um thank you for thaning my
 
01:41:47.149 --> 01:41:47.159 align:start position:0%
question um did you see the or read the
 
01:41:50.109 --> 01:41:50.119 align:start position:0%
sb23 the Senate bill regarding this as
 
01:41:52.390 --> 01:41:52.400 align:start position:0%
well just curious uh I haven't had a
 
01:41:54.390 --> 01:41:54.400 align:start position:0%
chance to revie all the details of that
 
01:41:58.390 --> 01:41:58.400 align:start position:0%
bill I am aware of of that bill um and
 
01:42:01.229 --> 01:42:01.239 align:start position:0%
uh I think uh this bill in front of you
 
01:42:04.589 --> 01:42:04.599 align:start position:0%
has a framework that uh is very useful
 
01:42:07.790 --> 01:42:07.800 align:start position:0%
from a law enforcement perspective um
 
01:42:10.030 --> 01:42:10.040 align:start position:0%
these every child protection case is
 
01:42:13.149 --> 01:42:13.159 align:start position:0%
very different and uh they call for very
 
01:42:14.629 --> 01:42:14.639 align:start position:0%
different responses from our
 
01:42:17.189 --> 01:42:17.199 align:start position:0%
multi-disciplinary team so some child
 
01:42:18.790 --> 01:42:18.800 align:start position:0%
protection cases are really most
 
01:42:22.470 --> 01:42:22.480 align:start position:0%
suitable for a uh uh civil child
 
01:42:24.589 --> 01:42:24.599 align:start position:0%
protection resp response other cases
 
01:42:26.189 --> 01:42:26.199 align:start position:0%
that are more egregious are really more
 
01:42:28.669 --> 01:42:28.679 align:start position:0%
suitable for a law enforcement response
 
01:42:31.030 --> 01:42:31.040 align:start position:0%
but what the public really expects of us
 
01:42:34.350 --> 01:42:34.360 align:start position:0%
as a whole as a system is that uh we
 
01:42:37.149 --> 01:42:37.159 align:start position:0%
work together and we have we address
 
01:42:39.550 --> 01:42:39.560 align:start position:0%
each situation with the proper tools and
 
01:42:42.390 --> 01:42:42.400 align:start position:0%
I think uh we are missing a very
 
01:42:44.270 --> 01:42:44.280 align:start position:0%
important tool in terms of the law
 
01:42:47.030 --> 01:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
enforcement response to these cases uh
 
01:42:48.709 --> 01:42:48.719 align:start position:0%
that needs to be available to us and I
 
01:42:51.629 --> 01:42:51.639 align:start position:0%
think this bill provides that thank you
 
01:42:54.430 --> 01:42:54.440 align:start position:0%
Chief you see nothing else thank you
 
01:42:55.830 --> 01:42:55.840 align:start position:0%
again thank you anyone else wishing to
 
01:43:06.709 --> 01:43:06.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:09.669 --> 01:43:09.679 align:start position:0%
forward good morning um I don't get to
 
01:43:10.990 --> 01:43:11.000 align:start position:0%
visit the criminal justice committee
 
01:43:12.510 --> 01:43:12.520 align:start position:0%
very often anymore uh my name is
 
01:43:14.950 --> 01:43:14.960 align:start position:0%
attorney Lisa massio I am the associate
 
01:43:17.149 --> 01:43:17.159 align:start position:0%
child advocate with the office of the
 
01:43:19.910 --> 01:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
child advocate I used to show up here uh
 
01:43:21.030 --> 01:43:21.040 align:start position:0%
when I worked for the Department of
 
01:43:23.109 --> 01:43:23.119 align:start position:0%
Correction several years ago but in our
 
01:43:24.669 --> 01:43:24.679 align:start position:0%
current role we do not specialize in
 
01:43:26.669 --> 01:43:26.679 align:start position:0%
criminal law um so we tend to be in
 
01:43:29.109 --> 01:43:29.119 align:start position:0%
children and family we did sign in last
 
01:43:31.310 --> 01:43:31.320 align:start position:0%
week um on this bill unfortunately I
 
01:43:32.950 --> 01:43:32.960 align:start position:0%
wasn't able to attend the hearing and
 
01:43:35.070 --> 01:43:35.080 align:start position:0%
and I wasn't able to um connect with the
 
01:43:37.470 --> 01:43:37.480 align:start position:0%
County attorneys we do have concerns
 
01:43:40.430 --> 01:43:40.440 align:start position:0%
about this bill as written um the
 
01:43:43.070 --> 01:43:43.080 align:start position:0%
stakeholders were not involved um from
 
01:43:44.990 --> 01:43:45.000 align:start position:0%
the outset so we did sort of catch wind
 
01:43:46.910 --> 01:43:46.920 align:start position:0%
of this a little bit late did not really
 
01:43:49.550 --> 01:43:49.560 align:start position:0%
get brought into the conversation um as
 
01:43:50.990 --> 01:43:51.000 align:start position:0%
I said when I signed in we just have
 
01:43:53.870 --> 01:43:53.880 align:start position:0%
concerns as it's written um neglect
 
01:43:57.310 --> 01:43:57.320 align:start position:0%
really is a term of art used in 169c it
 
01:43:59.990 --> 01:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
is defined there um I think a lot of the
 
01:44:01.830 --> 01:44:01.840 align:start position:0%
questions last week that I heard I did
 
01:44:04.149 --> 01:44:04.159 align:start position:0%
watch on YouTube were very insightful
 
01:44:06.550 --> 01:44:06.560 align:start position:0%
about sort of the breath and vagueness
 
01:44:09.589 --> 01:44:09.599 align:start position:0%
of this language um and I did come today
 
01:44:11.390 --> 01:44:11.400 align:start position:0%
to be able to point out to the committee
 
01:44:14.870 --> 01:44:14.880 align:start position:0%
that um SP sp23 was filed we've actually
 
01:44:17.510 --> 01:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
been working um with Lieutenant Nicholas
 
01:44:20.550 --> 01:44:20.560 align:start position:0%
julus and the chiefs of police for quite
 
01:44:21.830 --> 01:44:21.840 align:start position:0%
some time that language has actually
 
01:44:23.350 --> 01:44:23.360 align:start position:0%
been floating around for a couple of
 
01:44:25.790 --> 01:44:25.800 align:start position:0%
years um with a number of stakeholders
 
01:44:28.510 --> 01:44:28.520 align:start position:0%
on that language because absolutely the
 
01:44:30.550 --> 01:44:30.560 align:start position:0%
cases that were talked about last week
 
01:44:33.750 --> 01:44:33.760 align:start position:0%
were horrific and should not happen
 
01:44:36.109 --> 01:44:36.119 align:start position:0%
there are definite gaps in the system
 
01:44:37.830 --> 01:44:37.840 align:start position:0%
that is why the office of child advocate
 
01:44:40.229 --> 01:44:40.239 align:start position:0%
was created was because of cases like
 
01:44:43.750 --> 01:44:43.760 align:start position:0%
those um I Heard uh Mr John de Joy's
 
01:44:46.270 --> 01:44:46.280 align:start position:0%
testimony last week and we agree with
 
01:44:47.910 --> 01:44:47.920 align:start position:0%
some of his points it is the child
 
01:44:51.470 --> 01:44:51.480 align:start position:0%
protection system that um failed and and
 
01:44:54.430 --> 01:44:54.440 align:start position:0%
had those gaps we are working on a bill
 
01:44:57.589 --> 01:44:57.599 align:start position:0%
there too HB 553 was actually just heard
 
01:44:59.990 --> 01:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
yesterday there are additional
 
01:45:02.950 --> 01:45:02.960 align:start position:0%
definitions being proposed including um
 
01:45:04.910 --> 01:45:04.920 align:start position:0%
very specifically under the definition
 
01:45:09.109 --> 01:45:09.119 align:start position:0%
of neglect this idea of entrustment to
 
01:45:12.189 --> 01:45:12.199 align:start position:0%
an inappropriate person in addition s
 
01:45:14.589 --> 01:45:14.599 align:start position:0%
sp23 by enhancing endangering the
 
01:45:16.589 --> 01:45:16.599 align:start position:0%
welfare of a child which I know you
 
01:45:19.790 --> 01:45:19.800 align:start position:0%
mentioned um we think between those two
 
01:45:22.070 --> 01:45:22.080 align:start position:0%
bills really these gaps can be filled
 
01:45:23.910 --> 01:45:23.920 align:start position:0%
and we are
 
01:45:25.589 --> 01:45:25.599 align:start position:0%
hesitant with the way this bill is
 
01:45:28.030 --> 01:45:28.040 align:start position:0%
currently written to add an additional
 
01:45:31.030 --> 01:45:31.040 align:start position:0%
crime um it may muddy the waters it
 
01:45:33.070 --> 01:45:33.080 align:start position:0%
certainly is more difficult to reunify a
 
01:45:34.990 --> 01:45:35.000 align:start position:0%
family or provide services when one
 
01:45:37.350 --> 01:45:37.360 align:start position:0%
parent is incarcerated or taken out of
 
01:45:40.430 --> 01:45:40.440 align:start position:0%
the home um we don't really support the
 
01:45:42.430 --> 01:45:42.440 align:start position:0%
idea of a criminal law being used to
 
01:45:44.430 --> 01:45:44.440 align:start position:0%
threaten people and force them to follow
 
01:45:46.990 --> 01:45:47.000 align:start position:0%
a dcyf safety plan because as someone
 
01:45:48.830 --> 01:45:48.840 align:start position:0%
asked last week the result of not
 
01:45:50.990 --> 01:45:51.000 align:start position:0%
following a dcyf safety plan is having a
 
01:45:53.990 --> 01:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
dcyf case filed and the end result of
 
01:45:55.629 --> 01:45:55.639 align:start position:0%
that if you do not comply is that you
 
01:45:57.189 --> 01:45:57.199 align:start position:0%
have your parental rights terminated so
 
01:46:00.470 --> 01:46:00.480 align:start position:0%
that is a extreme outcome um we don't
 
01:46:02.390 --> 01:46:02.400 align:start position:0%
know that adding an additional criminal
 
01:46:05.430 --> 01:46:05.440 align:start position:0%
law will help that system work any
 
01:46:07.189 --> 01:46:07.199 align:start position:0%
better we obviously support the
 
01:46:10.350 --> 01:46:10.360 align:start position:0%
protection of children and want cases
 
01:46:12.910 --> 01:46:12.920 align:start position:0%
like we heard about last week uh not to
 
01:46:15.709 --> 01:46:15.719 align:start position:0%
happen that is the purpose of our office
 
01:46:18.709 --> 01:46:18.719 align:start position:0%
um we're happy to work with folks um we
 
01:46:19.950 --> 01:46:19.960 align:start position:0%
wish that we had kind of been involved
 
01:46:22.709 --> 01:46:22.719 align:start position:0%
with the drafting of 257 earlier on um
 
01:46:24.550 --> 01:46:24.560 align:start position:0%
we hate to come out against things that
 
01:46:27.109 --> 01:46:27.119 align:start position:0%
are intended to help children because
 
01:46:29.910 --> 01:46:29.920 align:start position:0%
this bill the intent truly is important
 
01:46:31.830 --> 01:46:31.840 align:start position:0%
there are gaps in the system we want to
 
01:46:34.750 --> 01:46:34.760 align:start position:0%
see them closed um we think that they
 
01:46:38.870 --> 01:46:38.880 align:start position:0%
may be working within s sp23 and um we
 
01:46:41.709 --> 01:46:41.719 align:start position:0%
hope that HB 553 has some of those
 
01:46:44.390 --> 01:46:44.400 align:start position:0%
pieces too to fill those gaps in cases
 
01:46:44.400 --> 01:46:45.390 align:start position:0%
pieces too to fill those gaps in cases
like

01:46:45.390 --> 01:46:45.400 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:46:48.990 --> 01:46:49.000 align:start position:0%
that thank you um it seems to me though
 
01:46:51.790 --> 01:46:51.800 align:start position:0%
our our statutes have a couple purposes
 
01:46:54.270 --> 01:46:54.280 align:start position:0%
one purpose is is the deterrence that we
 
01:46:56.270 --> 01:46:56.280 align:start position:0%
talked about um and another is
 
01:46:58.310 --> 01:46:58.320 align:start position:0%
punishment and and so some of the things
 
01:47:00.990 --> 01:47:01.000 align:start position:0%
we heard last week warrant punishment
 
01:47:02.950 --> 01:47:02.960 align:start position:0%
absolutely so the two bills you've
 
01:47:05.270 --> 01:47:05.280 align:start position:0%
talked about and really your office's
 
01:47:08.510 --> 01:47:08.520 align:start position:0%
Bailey wig isn't necessarily in in the
 
01:47:10.310 --> 01:47:10.320 align:start position:0%
criminal prosecution that punishment
 
01:47:11.709 --> 01:47:11.719 align:start position:0%
aspect to the people that do these
 
01:47:14.629 --> 01:47:14.639 align:start position:0%
things is it s sp23 is a criminal law
 
01:47:18.030 --> 01:47:18.040 align:start position:0%
yes um that one it makes amendments to
 
01:47:20.950 --> 01:47:20.960 align:start position:0%
the child endangerment statute to
 
01:47:25.669 --> 01:47:25.679 align:start position:0%
enhance that um area and I think if this
 
01:47:28.310 --> 01:47:28.320 align:start position:0%
committee finds gaps that may be able to
 
01:47:30.149 --> 01:47:30.159 align:start position:0%
address in within that child
 
01:47:31.990 --> 01:47:32.000 align:start position:0%
endangerment maybe flesh that out a
 
01:47:34.310 --> 01:47:34.320 align:start position:0%
little bit more rather than adding this
 
01:47:37.990 --> 01:47:38.000 align:start position:0%
new crime that is kind of Broad and kind
 
01:47:41.229 --> 01:47:41.239 align:start position:0%
of vague may be more helpful um the
 
01:47:44.310 --> 01:47:44.320 align:start position:0%
reason that we were involved with sb23
 
01:47:46.270 --> 01:47:46.280 align:start position:0%
is because of that multi-disciplinary
 
01:47:48.750 --> 01:47:48.760 align:start position:0%
team that the chief mentioned yeah often
 
01:47:50.750 --> 01:47:50.760 align:start position:0%
a case particularly for abuse will
 
01:47:54.390 --> 01:47:54.400 align:start position:0%
involve both child protection and um
 
01:47:56.310 --> 01:47:56.320 align:start position:0%
criminal prosecution and it is typically
 
01:47:57.830 --> 01:47:57.840 align:start position:0%
child endangerment and I did hear a
 
01:48:00.109 --> 01:48:00.119 align:start position:0%
testimony last week that law has some
 
01:48:03.070 --> 01:48:03.080 align:start position:0%
gaps too it's hard to prosecute the um
 
01:48:04.790 --> 01:48:04.800 align:start position:0%
penalties were minimal so they weren't
 
01:48:08.070 --> 01:48:08.080 align:start position:0%
really using it so SP sp23 is to enhance
 
01:48:10.550 --> 01:48:10.560 align:start position:0%
criminal law and specifically the
 
01:48:12.589 --> 01:48:12.599 align:start position:0%
penalties as well to make them felony
 
01:48:15.790 --> 01:48:15.800 align:start position:0%
level in some cases which would make
 
01:48:15.800 --> 01:48:17.070 align:start position:0%
level in some cases which would make
them

01:48:17.070 --> 01:48:17.080 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:48:20.189 --> 01:48:20.199 align:start position:0%
um more prosecutable that there it's a
 
01:48:22.189 --> 01:48:22.199 align:start position:0%
higher level penalty because exactly
 
01:48:24.229 --> 01:48:24.239 align:start position:0%
those char that didn't happen in those
 
01:48:27.629 --> 01:48:27.639 align:start position:0%
cases last week deserve to be felonies
 
01:48:30.470 --> 01:48:30.480 align:start position:0%
um and that hadn't really existed so um
 
01:48:32.550 --> 01:48:32.560 align:start position:0%
sb23 is Criminal which is why it was not
 
01:48:34.390 --> 01:48:34.400 align:start position:0%
a bill the OCA was putting forth we
 
01:48:36.270 --> 01:48:36.280 align:start position:0%
worked on it with Lieutenant George ulis
 
01:48:38.669 --> 01:48:38.679 align:start position:0%
because he frequently works with us on
 
01:48:40.189 --> 01:48:40.199 align:start position:0%
those multi-disciplinary teams he's a
 
01:48:43.270 --> 01:48:43.280 align:start position:0%
juvenile detective um so yes criminal
 
01:48:44.870 --> 01:48:44.880 align:start position:0%
law is not our Bailey Wick we let him
 
01:48:46.950 --> 01:48:46.960 align:start position:0%
work on that with the chiefs of police
 
01:48:48.790 --> 01:48:48.800 align:start position:0%
okay thank you um representative Murray
 
01:48:51.109 --> 01:48:51.119 align:start position:0%
you have a
 
01:48:53.510 --> 01:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
question well I was the along the same
 
01:48:55.310 --> 01:48:55.320 align:start position:0%
lines with the punishment versus the
 
01:49:01.229 --> 01:49:01.239 align:start position:0%
deterrence of this but um with SB 23 um
 
01:49:03.589 --> 01:49:03.599 align:start position:0%
do you have thoughts on it looks like
 
01:49:05.589 --> 01:49:05.599 align:start position:0%
there's already an adjustment to change
 
01:49:07.149 --> 01:49:07.159 align:start position:0%
from purposefully endangering the
 
01:49:10.470 --> 01:49:10.480 align:start position:0%
welfare to knowingly would you do you
 
01:49:12.510 --> 01:49:12.520 align:start position:0%
have any thoughts on like lowering that
 
01:49:15.470 --> 01:49:15.480 align:start position:0%
even even more like the uh yeah to
 
01:49:19.109 --> 01:49:19.119 align:start position:0%
negligence I would defer to the the law
 
01:49:21.470 --> 01:49:21.480 align:start position:0%
enforcement folks I I practiced in the
 
01:49:24.950 --> 01:49:24.960 align:start position:0%
dcyf land in the Civil land I dabbled in
 
01:49:27.149 --> 01:49:27.159 align:start position:0%
homicide prosecution at the AG's office
 
01:49:29.830 --> 01:49:29.840 align:start position:0%
for a moment um but definitely I know
 
01:49:31.470 --> 01:49:31.480 align:start position:0%
I'm Beth sergeant from the police Chiefs
 
01:49:36.790 --> 01:49:36.800 align:start position:0%
Association is here I heard um Chief Lee
 
01:49:38.910 --> 01:49:38.920 align:start position:0%
sorry um say that he was willing to work
 
01:49:40.229 --> 01:49:40.239 align:start position:0%
together so I would absolutely defer to
 
01:49:42.189 --> 01:49:42.199 align:start position:0%
them of you know what the men's Rea
 
01:49:44.629 --> 01:49:44.639 align:start position:0%
needs to be obviously you know civil
 
01:49:46.709 --> 01:49:46.719 align:start position:0%
it's preponderance of the evidence it's
 
01:49:49.030 --> 01:49:49.040 align:start position:0%
a much lower standard but I would put
 
01:49:51.790 --> 01:49:51.800 align:start position:0%
out there that if they're having trouble
 
01:49:53.270 --> 01:49:53.280 align:start position:0%
charging and reaching that criminal
 
01:49:55.310 --> 01:49:55.320 align:start position:0%
standard that is a reason why we are
 
01:49:57.709 --> 01:49:57.719 align:start position:0%
also trying to bulk up that civil
 
01:49:59.270 --> 01:49:59.280 align:start position:0%
standard because it ponderance of the
 
01:50:01.870 --> 01:50:01.880 align:start position:0%
evidence is much lower to really fill
 
01:50:03.750 --> 01:50:03.760 align:start position:0%
the gaps from both ends but I would I
 
01:50:06.229 --> 01:50:06.239 align:start position:0%
would defer to them as to what they felt
 
01:50:08.430 --> 01:50:08.440 align:start position:0%
the men's Rea needs to be from the cases
 
01:50:08.440 --> 01:50:11.270 align:start position:0%
the men's Rea needs to be from the cases
they've

01:50:11.270 --> 01:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:14.149 --> 01:50:14.159 align:start position:0%
seen thank you for sharing with us today
 
01:50:16.669 --> 01:50:16.679 align:start position:0%
I do know the words men's Rea but that's
 
01:50:18.550 --> 01:50:18.560 align:start position:0%
it's that's enough thank you I heard
 
01:50:21.470 --> 01:50:21.480 align:start position:0%
that once on Law and Order myself anyone
 
01:50:23.470 --> 01:50:23.480 align:start position:0%
anyone else wishing to speak to us who
 
01:50:26.350 --> 01:50:26.360 align:start position:0%
has not yet done so seeing none thank
 
01:50:27.550 --> 01:50:27.560 align:start position:0%
you very much and we're going to close
 
01:50:29.390 --> 01:50:29.400 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee work session on this
 
01:50:31.709 --> 01:50:31.719 align:start position:0%
bill like the last bill I think what
 
01:50:34.270 --> 01:50:34.280 align:start position:0%
we'll do is we'll start off with a um
 
01:50:36.070 --> 01:50:36.080 align:start position:0%
with a draft piece of legislation and
 
01:50:38.870 --> 01:50:38.880 align:start position:0%
see what we can come together and in a
 
01:50:40.629 --> 01:50:40.639 align:start position:0%
couple weeks we'll have a better feeling
 
01:50:42.589 --> 01:50:42.599 align:start position:0%
on what the outcome of the Senate bill
 
01:50:47.430 --> 01:50:47.440 align:start position:0%
will be and if if that bill um in anyway
 
01:50:49.990 --> 01:50:50.000 align:start position:0%
addresses the concern that the County
 
01:50:52.310 --> 01:50:52.320 align:start position:0%
attorneys had and if it doesn't we'll
 
01:51:21.550 --> 01:51:21.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:21.560 --> 01:51:51.510 align:start position:0%

that I'm opening the public hearing on
 
02:34:05.630 --> 02:34:05.640 align:start position:0%
House Bill 500 establishing an enhanced
 
02:34:06.950 --> 02:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
enforcement zones for motor vehicle
 
02:34:08.190 --> 02:34:08.200 align:start position:0%
speed enforcement increasing the
 
02:34:10.349 --> 02:34:10.359 align:start position:0%
penalties for speeding in those zones by
 
02:34:13.790 --> 02:34:13.800 align:start position:0%
50% Etc I invite the prime sponsor
 
02:34:16.670 --> 02:34:16.680 align:start position:0%
to introduce the bill is it me please
 
02:34:19.429 --> 02:34:19.439 align:start position:0%
tell me something okay I know I'm one of
 
02:34:19.439 --> 02:34:30.510 align:start position:0%
tell me something okay I know I'm one of
these

02:34:30.510 --> 02:34:30.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:32.950 --> 02:34:32.960 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman good
 
02:34:35.469 --> 02:34:35.479 align:start position:0%
morning well I guess it's not anymore
 
02:34:37.550 --> 02:34:37.560 align:start position:0%
but good noon time to the criminal
 
02:34:39.670 --> 02:34:39.680 align:start position:0%
justice committee for the record I'm
 
02:34:41.269 --> 02:34:41.279 align:start position:0%
Representative Steve Pearson Rockingham
 
02:34:44.070 --> 02:34:44.080 align:start position:0%
District 13 which encompasses the town
 
02:34:44.080 --> 02:34:45.469 align:start position:0%
District 13 which encompasses the town
of

02:34:45.469 --> 02:34:45.479 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:34:48.070 --> 02:34:48.080 align:start position:0%
dairy what I bring before you today is
 
02:34:51.230 --> 02:34:51.240 align:start position:0%
House Bill 500 establishing an enhanced
 
02:34:54.510 --> 02:34:54.520 align:start position:0%
enforcement zone for motor vehicle speed
 
02:34:56.349 --> 02:34:56.359 align:start position:0%
enforcement and increasing penalties
 
02:34:57.870 --> 02:34:57.880 align:start position:0%
within those
 
02:34:59.950 --> 02:34:59.960 align:start position:0%
zones I'll give you a little bit of my
 
02:35:01.230 --> 02:35:01.240 align:start position:0%
background I've been a firefighter in
 
02:35:03.070 --> 02:35:03.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
02:35:06.510 --> 02:35:06.520 align:start position:0%
for 24
 
02:35:10.550 --> 02:35:10.560 align:start position:0%
years serving the overwhelming majority
 
02:35:13.510 --> 02:35:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:18.070 --> 02:35:18.080 align:start position:0%
Manchester I have spent time on actually
 
02:35:20.150 --> 02:35:20.160 align:start position:0%
all three engine companies that I worked
 
02:35:23.550 --> 02:35:23.560 align:start position:0%
for in my career in Manchester um had
 
02:35:26.870 --> 02:35:26.880 align:start position:0%
responsibilities on the
 
02:35:29.070 --> 02:35:29.080 align:start position:0%
interstates so what I'm bringing before
 
02:35:33.269 --> 02:35:33.279 align:start position:0%
you here is something that is
 
02:35:36.590 --> 02:35:36.600 align:start position:0%
potentially a way to address a
 
02:35:41.190 --> 02:35:41.200 align:start position:0%
problem we have a significant speed
 
02:35:44.309 --> 02:35:44.319 align:start position:0%
problem on our divided
 
02:35:48.630 --> 02:35:48.640 align:start position:0%
highways just recently n Interstate 95
 
02:35:50.830 --> 02:35:50.840 align:start position:0%
experienced over the course of several
 
02:35:52.670 --> 02:35:52.680 align:start position:0%
Wednesdays we're quite not really not
 
02:35:55.190 --> 02:35:55.200 align:start position:0%
sure why they were Wednesdays but some
 
02:35:58.469 --> 02:35:58.479 align:start position:0%
horrific accidents fatalities we've had
 
02:36:01.510 --> 02:36:01.520 align:start position:0%
a a very interesting and alarming number
 
02:36:03.790 --> 02:36:03.800 align:start position:0%
of fatalities in the recent
 
02:36:08.030 --> 02:36:08.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:10.990 --> 02:36:11.000 align:start position:0%
and there's got to be some sort of a
 
02:36:16.309 --> 02:36:16.319 align:start position:0%
mechanism here to to curb this now
 
02:36:19.590 --> 02:36:19.600 align:start position:0%
law generally speaking does one of three
 
02:36:21.309 --> 02:36:21.319 align:start position:0%
three things it either tells you to do
 
02:36:23.349 --> 02:36:23.359 align:start position:0%
something it tells you not to do
 
02:36:27.670 --> 02:36:27.680 align:start position:0%
something or it tells you how to do
 
02:36:31.510 --> 02:36:31.520 align:start position:0%
something but law has to be
 
02:36:33.230 --> 02:36:33.240 align:start position:0%
effective and
 
02:36:36.630 --> 02:36:36.640 align:start position:0%
it through the I suppose wonderful work
 
02:36:38.510 --> 02:36:38.520 align:start position:0%
of the Department of Transportation and
 
02:36:39.830 --> 02:36:39.840 align:start position:0%
the automobile
 
02:36:42.590 --> 02:36:42.600 align:start position:0%
industry we have the ability now to
 
02:36:44.429 --> 02:36:44.439 align:start position:0%
travel at
 
02:36:47.830 --> 02:36:47.840 align:start position:0%
speeds quite comfortably that we in the
 
02:36:52.150 --> 02:36:52.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:55.230 --> 02:36:55.240 align:start position:0%
entertained just driving up here
 
02:36:58.670 --> 02:36:58.680 align:start position:0%
today in not very good weather
 
02:37:02.230 --> 02:37:02.240 align:start position:0%
conditions and setting my cruise
 
02:37:06.190 --> 02:37:06.200 align:start position:0%
control 17 people pass me above 75 for
 
02:37:09.110 --> 02:37:09.120 align:start position:0%
well above 80 that's just one ride up
 
02:37:11.790 --> 02:37:11.800 align:start position:0%
here and anybody that comes up here to
 
02:37:14.230 --> 02:37:14.240 align:start position:0%
the State House via Interstate
 
02:37:17.230 --> 02:37:17.240 align:start position:0%
93 I'm sure is well versed in what
 
02:37:18.670 --> 02:37:18.680 align:start position:0%
they've experienced with their own two
 
02:37:18.680 --> 02:37:23.910 align:start position:0%
they've experienced with their own two
eyes

02:37:23.910 --> 02:37:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:26.349 --> 02:37:26.359 align:start position:0%
so I took the the thought process here
 
02:37:27.429 --> 02:37:27.439 align:start position:0%
and said
 
02:37:30.750 --> 02:37:30.760 align:start position:0%
okay we need to increase enforcement
 
02:37:32.230 --> 02:37:32.240 align:start position:0%
especially in these
 
02:37:34.750 --> 02:37:34.760 align:start position:0%
areas so how do we do this and how do we
 
02:37:39.950 --> 02:37:39.960 align:start position:0%
do this in a way where we're not
 
02:37:43.870 --> 02:37:43.880 align:start position:0%
whacking the taxpayer necessarily with
 
02:37:45.630 --> 02:37:45.640 align:start position:0%
the responsibility of an increased
 
02:37:47.990 --> 02:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
enforcement presence now my
 
02:37:50.429 --> 02:37:50.439 align:start position:0%
understanding is based on current law
 
02:37:52.469 --> 02:37:52.479 align:start position:0%
speeding tickets are used the money
 
02:37:54.469 --> 02:37:54.479 align:start position:0%
generated from speeding tickets are used
 
02:37:56.710 --> 02:37:56.720 align:start position:0%
to fund the court
 
02:37:59.429 --> 02:37:59.439 align:start position:0%
system what I am proposing is not
 
02:38:01.950 --> 02:38:01.960 align:start position:0%
eliminating that in any way the courts
 
02:38:03.389 --> 02:38:03.399 align:start position:0%
will still get
 
02:38:06.429 --> 02:38:06.439 align:start position:0%
their revenue if you will their funding
 
02:38:10.269 --> 02:38:10.279 align:start position:0%
from the generation of tickets but
 
02:38:12.990 --> 02:38:13.000 align:start position:0%
within the en enforcement zones of of
 
02:38:17.190 --> 02:38:17.200 align:start position:0%
these areas where we see the daily 100 m
 
02:38:19.910 --> 02:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
hour vehicles
 
02:38:21.990 --> 02:38:22.000 align:start position:0%
the enhancement of the find will go
 
02:38:25.030 --> 02:38:25.040 align:start position:0%
towards a non-aps fund to be used by the
 
02:38:30.630 --> 02:38:30.640 align:start position:0%
state police to pay for enhanced
 
02:38:32.910 --> 02:38:32.920 align:start position:0%
enforcement because of course if you put
 
02:38:34.910 --> 02:38:34.920 align:start position:0%
additional law enforcement on the road
 
02:38:39.349 --> 02:38:39.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:39.359 --> 02:38:41.110 align:start position:0%
 
cost

02:38:41.110 --> 02:38:41.120 align:start position:0%
cost
 
02:38:44.790 --> 02:38:44.800 align:start position:0%
now we have to be realistic here
 
02:38:46.990 --> 02:38:47.000 align:start position:0%
right everybody's had that moment
 
02:38:48.269 --> 02:38:48.279 align:start position:0%
traveling down the road where they look
 
02:38:49.750 --> 02:38:49.760 align:start position:0%
down at the speedometer and go whoa oh
 
02:38:52.349 --> 02:38:52.359 align:start position:0%
hey you know I didn't realize I was
 
02:38:53.469 --> 02:38:53.479 align:start position:0%
going that
 
02:38:55.670 --> 02:38:55.680 align:start position:0%
fast so there's a there's got to be a
 
02:38:58.230 --> 02:38:58.240 align:start position:0%
logical threshold is is to where you go
 
02:38:59.670 --> 02:38:59.680 align:start position:0%
from hey I'm just kind of cruising
 
02:39:01.630 --> 02:39:01.640 align:start position:0%
around and not really thinking about it
 
02:39:03.830 --> 02:39:03.840 align:start position:0%
to you know you really have to be
 
02:39:07.710 --> 02:39:07.720 align:start position:0%
thinking and be well aware of that you
 
02:39:09.830 --> 02:39:09.840 align:start position:0%
are traveling in excess of posted speed
 
02:39:12.230 --> 02:39:12.240 align:start position:0%
limits so 15 miles an hour seemed like a
 
02:39:15.269 --> 02:39:15.279 align:start position:0%
good starting spot for
 
02:39:17.429 --> 02:39:17.439 align:start position:0%
that that way it you know we're not
 
02:39:19.630 --> 02:39:19.640 align:start position:0%
sitting here pulling people over for
 
02:39:22.670 --> 02:39:22.680 align:start position:0%
over and six over and you know something
 
02:39:24.269 --> 02:39:24.279 align:start position:0%
that's really just hey I was going down
 
02:39:26.349 --> 02:39:26.359 align:start position:0%
a hill or you know I'm just cruising
 
02:39:27.910 --> 02:39:27.920 align:start position:0%
along with the the guy that's in front
 
02:39:30.870 --> 02:39:30.880 align:start position:0%
of me so that's the precipice of this
 
02:39:30.880 --> 02:39:33.190 align:start position:0%
of me so that's the precipice of this
entire

02:39:33.190 --> 02:39:33.200 align:start position:0%
entire
 
02:39:36.710 --> 02:39:36.720 align:start position:0%
concept it creates a non-aps and fund
 
02:39:40.710 --> 02:39:40.720 align:start position:0%
which then pays for the overtime or
 
02:39:42.670 --> 02:39:42.680 align:start position:0%
whatever we need the fuel the how
 
02:39:45.070 --> 02:39:45.080 align:start position:0%
whatever the cost is associated with
 
02:39:46.830 --> 02:39:46.840 align:start position:0%
having enhanced
 
02:39:49.469 --> 02:39:49.479 align:start position:0%
enforcement and if you simply don't want
 
02:39:51.790 --> 02:39:51.800 align:start position:0%
to fund it don't
 
02:39:55.110 --> 02:39:55.120 align:start position:0%
speed it's just that simple I'd love to
 
02:39:57.510 --> 02:39:57.520 align:start position:0%
see the fund have nothing in it because
 
02:40:00.190 --> 02:40:00.200 align:start position:0%
that would mean we would have compliance
 
02:40:03.790 --> 02:40:03.800 align:start position:0%
to our roads here I don't really want to
 
02:40:07.389 --> 02:40:07.399 align:start position:0%
get into the breakdown of the license
 
02:40:09.990 --> 02:40:10.000 align:start position:0%
plates for the people that fly by me at
 
02:40:12.070 --> 02:40:12.080 align:start position:0%
excessive speed they happen to be mostly
 
02:40:14.830 --> 02:40:14.840 align:start position:0%
red that's not a reflection on our
 
02:40:18.429 --> 02:40:18.439 align:start position:0%
current State Legislative plate color um
 
02:40:22.389 --> 02:40:22.399 align:start position:0%
but it is not certainly uh
 
02:40:25.990 --> 02:40:26.000 align:start position:0%
solely the folks from other states that
 
02:40:28.070 --> 02:40:28.080 align:start position:0%
are doing this we we bear responsibility
 
02:40:31.910 --> 02:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
as well so this is kind of a New Concept
 
02:40:34.950 --> 02:40:34.960 align:start position:0%
I'm not aware of this ever being
 
02:40:38.990 --> 02:40:39.000 align:start position:0%
proposed or enacted before um but it is
 
02:40:42.389 --> 02:40:42.399 align:start position:0%
you know a new new idea to to try to get
 
02:40:47.670 --> 02:40:47.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:50.230 --> 02:40:50.240 align:start position:0%
highways thank you repres for bringing
 
02:40:53.550 --> 02:40:53.560 align:start position:0%
the spill to us have you had any um
 
02:40:55.590 --> 02:40:55.600 align:start position:0%
contact or input from the Department of
 
02:40:59.710 --> 02:40:59.720 align:start position:0%
Safety absolutely not okay
 
02:41:02.590 --> 02:41:02.600 align:start position:0%
um I'm actually I have a bill that we'll
 
02:41:05.510 --> 02:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
be hearing um that I actually filed with
 
02:41:07.830 --> 02:41:07.840 align:start position:0%
regards to um speeding over 100 miles
 
02:41:10.710 --> 02:41:10.720 align:start position:0%
per hour and the department of safety um
 
02:41:12.230 --> 02:41:12.240 align:start position:0%
actually requested that we file it
 
02:41:14.870 --> 02:41:14.880 align:start position:0%
because you are correct the accidents um
 
02:41:16.670 --> 02:41:16.680 align:start position:0%
and the severity of them have increased
 
02:41:19.070 --> 02:41:19.080 align:start position:0%
exponentially over the last few years so
 
02:41:21.429 --> 02:41:21.439 align:start position:0%
there aware of it and they um they they
 
02:41:23.670 --> 02:41:23.680 align:start position:0%
also find it to be um worthy of
 
02:41:26.950 --> 02:41:26.960 align:start position:0%
legislation so I will um definitely when
 
02:41:29.349 --> 02:41:29.359 align:start position:0%
we bring up the bill that I'm proposing
 
02:41:30.910 --> 02:41:30.920 align:start position:0%
in your bill we'll look at the two of
 
02:41:32.830 --> 02:41:32.840 align:start position:0%
those together absolutely sure um
 
02:41:34.110 --> 02:41:34.120 align:start position:0%
questions for the
 
02:41:37.389 --> 02:41:37.399 align:start position:0%
representative yes representative
 
02:41:40.910 --> 02:41:40.920 align:start position:0%
s thank you for taking my question um
 
02:41:43.750 --> 02:41:43.760 align:start position:0%
when I was growing up in the 50s and
 
02:41:46.590 --> 02:41:46.600 align:start position:0%
6s uh if there was an automobile with
 
02:41:49.469 --> 02:41:49.479 align:start position:0%
more than 300 horsepower
 
02:41:53.950 --> 02:41:53.960 align:start position:0%
that was a high performance automobile
 
02:41:58.030 --> 02:41:58.040 align:start position:0%
today you can buy from a dealer cars
 
02:42:02.110 --> 02:42:02.120 align:start position:0%
with 600 800 or more
 
02:42:05.269 --> 02:42:05.279 align:start position:0%
horsepower uh it's it's I don't know
 
02:42:09.469 --> 02:42:09.479 align:start position:0%
where it stops but when you see these
 
02:42:12.269 --> 02:42:12.279 align:start position:0%
cars that are going over a 100,000 or
 
02:42:15.190 --> 02:42:15.200 align:start position:0%
100 miles an hour you wonder you know
 
02:42:16.910 --> 02:42:16.920 align:start position:0%
maybe they're just cruising along with
 
02:42:18.150 --> 02:42:18.160 align:start position:0%
their 800
 
02:42:22.030 --> 02:42:22.040 align:start position:0%
horsepower whatever you know I saw the
 
02:42:25.950 --> 02:42:25.960 align:start position:0%
other day on the news there was somebody
 
02:42:29.830 --> 02:42:29.840 align:start position:0%
who was in a 35 mph Zone going over 100
 
02:42:29.840 --> 02:42:31.670 align:start position:0%
who was in a 35 mph Zone going over 100
m

02:42:31.670 --> 02:42:31.680 align:start position:0%
m
 
02:42:34.710 --> 02:42:34.720 align:start position:0%
hour I would very much chairman Roy
 
02:42:37.630 --> 02:42:37.640 align:start position:0%
believe that yes it's it's horrendous
 
02:42:40.830 --> 02:42:40.840 align:start position:0%
now this bill would not do anything to
 
02:42:43.710 --> 02:42:43.720 align:start position:0%
that person am I correct cor yeah I
 
02:42:45.670 --> 02:42:45.680 align:start position:0%
don't believe we have any 35 M zones on
 
02:42:48.429 --> 02:42:48.439 align:start position:0%
our divided highways so no that's a that
 
02:42:50.830 --> 02:42:50.840 align:start position:0%
would be a local ISS
 
02:42:53.910 --> 02:42:53.920 align:start position:0%
too did you consider um a different
 
02:42:56.429 --> 02:42:56.439 align:start position:0%
looking at the whole um the way that we
 
02:42:58.389 --> 02:42:58.399 align:start position:0%
structure our speeding finds I know the
 
02:43:01.389 --> 02:43:01.399 align:start position:0%
way they do it in the the state below us
 
02:43:04.750 --> 02:43:04.760 align:start position:0%
that shall not be named um that I
 
02:43:06.870 --> 02:43:06.880 align:start position:0%
believe for the first 10 miles an hour
 
02:43:09.389 --> 02:43:09.399 align:start position:0%
over it's $50 and then it's I believe
 
02:43:12.230 --> 02:43:12.240 align:start position:0%
it's $10 for every mile an hour
 
02:43:15.510 --> 02:43:15.520 align:start position:0%
thereafter so it gets up into the four
 
02:43:17.910 --> 02:43:17.920 align:start position:0%
five $600 range when you start going up
 
02:43:20.070 --> 02:43:20.080 align:start position:0%
that many miles an hour uh did you look
 
02:43:21.990 --> 02:43:22.000 align:start position:0%
at how our our speed finds are
 
02:43:24.590 --> 02:43:24.600 align:start position:0%
structured no you know I what I what I
 
02:43:27.309 --> 02:43:27.319 align:start position:0%
don't want to do is I don't want to at
 
02:43:30.630 --> 02:43:30.640 align:start position:0%
least in my mind I don't want to have
 
02:43:35.070 --> 02:43:35.080 align:start position:0%
the the guy that's looks down and he's
 
02:43:38.630 --> 02:43:38.640 align:start position:0%
doing eight over I mean that that be $50
 
02:43:40.630 --> 02:43:40.640 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean we have intent right I mean
 
02:43:42.710 --> 02:43:42.720 align:start position:0%
f i I'd like to believe folks generally
 
02:43:46.110 --> 02:43:46.120 align:start position:0%
want to do the right thing right and and
 
02:43:50.110 --> 02:43:50.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:52.790 --> 02:43:52.800 align:start position:0%
growing up in the 80s okay the pothole
 
02:43:55.910 --> 02:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
era of New Hampshire um you know in in
 
02:43:58.630 --> 02:43:58.640 align:start position:0%
vehicles of that time in and I can
 
02:44:01.269 --> 02:44:01.279 align:start position:0%
certainly address and speak to I'm a hot
 
02:44:05.990 --> 02:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
rod guy I have nine antiques but um so
 
02:44:07.230 --> 02:44:07.240 align:start position:0%
you know there is a there is a
 
02:44:10.030 --> 02:44:10.040 align:start position:0%
marketable difference between my 2017
 
02:44:13.309 --> 02:44:13.319 align:start position:0%
Buick GS which is the same horsepower is
 
02:44:16.389 --> 02:44:16.399 align:start position:0%
a 1986 Grand National right and the
 
02:44:18.510 --> 02:44:18.520 align:start position:0%
Grand National was considered a a race
 
02:44:21.269 --> 02:44:21.279 align:start position:0%
car so yes you know things have
 
02:44:23.590 --> 02:44:23.600 align:start position:0%
progressed things have changed the the
 
02:44:27.190 --> 02:44:27.200 align:start position:0%
Dodge um Hellcat is
 
02:44:32.269 --> 02:44:32.279 align:start position:0%
800 show roughly 800 horsepower so I but
 
02:44:35.349 --> 02:44:35.359 align:start position:0%
but again I don't want to get into the
 
02:44:37.389 --> 02:44:37.399 align:start position:0%
like like you see in like small towns in
 
02:44:38.510 --> 02:44:38.520 align:start position:0%
Missouri where they're writing your
 
02:44:40.670 --> 02:44:40.680 align:start position:0%
speed and take it for four over I you
 
02:44:43.550 --> 02:44:43.560 align:start position:0%
know I I just don't think that's the the
 
02:44:46.030 --> 02:44:46.040 align:start position:0%
the intent and the idea behind this this
 
02:44:48.389 --> 02:44:48.399 align:start position:0%
is for the folks when you get above 15
 
02:44:51.230 --> 02:44:51.240 align:start position:0%
over you you know you're speeding you
 
02:44:54.870 --> 02:44:54.880 align:start position:0%
know you're exceeding what is reasonable
 
02:44:58.670 --> 02:44:58.680 align:start position:0%
and that's really where the enhanced
 
02:45:03.070 --> 02:45:03.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:06.190 --> 02:45:06.200 align:start position:0%
fruition represent Shar uh it would be
 
02:45:09.550 --> 02:45:09.560 align:start position:0%
helpful if you if if you could um talk
 
02:45:11.429 --> 02:45:11.439 align:start position:0%
to the Department of Safety and see what
 
02:45:14.070 --> 02:45:14.080 align:start position:0%
they think about this just it I'm
 
02:45:17.269 --> 02:45:17.279 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable I mean I like the idea um
 
02:45:18.710 --> 02:45:18.720 align:start position:0%
uh in spite of the fact it might affect
 
02:45:21.950 --> 02:45:21.960 align:start position:0%
my commute from Portsmouth um but it
 
02:45:23.389 --> 02:45:23.399 align:start position:0%
would be useful to see what they think
 
02:45:25.070 --> 02:45:25.080 align:start position:0%
if they're on board with this kind of
 
02:45:26.990 --> 02:45:27.000 align:start position:0%
new structure well you know the purpose
 
02:45:28.710 --> 02:45:28.720 align:start position:0%
of a public hearing is to bring forward
 
02:45:31.269 --> 02:45:31.279 align:start position:0%
opinions and ideas of those affected by
 
02:45:31.279 --> 02:45:33.550 align:start position:0%
opinions and ideas of those affected by
legislation

02:45:33.550 --> 02:45:33.560 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
02:45:36.870 --> 02:45:36.880 align:start position:0%
and that might happen so um I would also
 
02:45:38.429 --> 02:45:38.439 align:start position:0%
like to point out and I don't know how
 
02:45:40.349 --> 02:45:40.359 align:start position:0%
this happened shame on me in the proof
 
02:45:42.349 --> 02:45:42.359 align:start position:0%
reading process Interstate 89 was
 
02:45:44.750 --> 02:45:44.760 align:start position:0%
supposed to be included in this and for
 
02:45:47.870 --> 02:45:47.880 align:start position:0%
some reason it is not so um I'm not here
 
02:45:51.070 --> 02:45:51.080 align:start position:0%
to uh let the fol on our Western area of
 
02:45:54.070 --> 02:45:54.080 align:start position:0%
the state off the hook in this concept
 
02:45:58.510 --> 02:45:58.520 align:start position:0%
um but that was an inadvertent
 
02:46:02.230 --> 02:46:02.240 align:start position:0%
Omission okay um if we work on the
 
02:46:04.990 --> 02:46:05.000 align:start position:0%
language we'll we'll reintroduce that
 
02:46:06.550 --> 02:46:06.560 align:start position:0%
any further questions for the
 
02:46:06.560 --> 02:46:08.389 align:start position:0%
any further questions for the
representative

02:46:08.389 --> 02:46:08.399 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:46:11.670 --> 02:46:11.680 align:start position:0%
per yeah I'm thinking like 20 or 25
 
02:46:14.389 --> 02:46:14.399 align:start position:0%
miles an hour over because like you say
 
02:46:16.110 --> 02:46:16.120 align:start position:0%
in these cars if you're not paying
 
02:46:18.150 --> 02:46:18.160 align:start position:0%
attention it's really easy to get up to
 
02:46:20.190 --> 02:46:20.200 align:start position:0%
25 over and then look down and say oh
 
02:46:24.070 --> 02:46:24.080 align:start position:0%
crap so that's where I'm at at 25
 
02:46:25.710 --> 02:46:25.720 align:start position:0%
believe that's where I'm at well you
 
02:46:28.670 --> 02:46:28.680 align:start position:0%
know representative PR um knowing that
 
02:46:30.309 --> 02:46:30.319 align:start position:0%
your background is is similar in a lot
 
02:46:32.309 --> 02:46:32.319 align:start position:0%
of ways to mine I I would believe that
 
02:46:33.750 --> 02:46:33.760 align:start position:0%
but let's look at some of the math here
 
02:46:35.309 --> 02:46:35.319 align:start position:0%
right so you get north of conquered the
 
02:46:38.630 --> 02:46:38.640 align:start position:0%
speed limit goes to 70 right in theory
 
02:46:40.150 --> 02:46:40.160 align:start position:0%
if you look at the Federal Department of
 
02:46:42.150 --> 02:46:42.160 align:start position:0%
Transportation guidelines interstates
 
02:46:45.710 --> 02:46:45.720 align:start position:0%
are designed at 75 mil an hour right at
 
02:46:47.309 --> 02:46:47.319 align:start position:0%
that rate you'd be doing
 
02:46:50.950 --> 02:46:50.960 align:start position:0%
95 before you hit that 95 you know
 
02:46:53.349 --> 02:46:53.359 align:start position:0%
you're doing you're doing speeds at that
 
02:46:56.429 --> 02:46:56.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:01.910 --> 02:47:01.920 align:start position:0%
I at the 60 followup at the 65 M hour
 
02:47:06.670 --> 02:47:06.680 align:start position:0%
speed limit 20 over probably 85 but I'm
 
02:47:09.150 --> 02:47:09.160 align:start position:0%
thinking 80 okay we can have that
 
02:47:11.590 --> 02:47:11.600 align:start position:0%
conversation in executive session um I
 
02:47:13.150 --> 02:47:13.160 align:start position:0%
just want to go on the record and this
 
02:47:15.309 --> 02:47:15.319 align:start position:0%
is all the fault of the electric car
 
02:47:19.150 --> 02:47:19.160 align:start position:0%
people um the the the other ones came
 
02:47:20.790 --> 02:47:20.800 align:start position:0%
out with that ridiculous car that has
 
02:47:25.429 --> 02:47:25.439 align:start position:0%
ludicrous mode and it goes 170 mph that
 
02:47:27.870 --> 02:47:27.880 align:start position:0%
would be the the um what is it the model
 
02:47:31.030 --> 02:47:31.040 align:start position:0%
S um
 
02:47:33.870 --> 02:47:33.880 align:start position:0%
um well chairman chairman Ry I believe
 
02:47:36.230 --> 02:47:36.240 align:start position:0%
Ludicrous Speed was established um in
 
02:47:39.990 --> 02:47:40.000 align:start position:0%
Space Balls but they did steal that so
 
02:47:41.510 --> 02:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
um the other thing too to touch on that
 
02:47:43.070 --> 02:47:43.080 align:start position:0%
you know that when you talk about today
 
02:47:44.790 --> 02:47:44.800 align:start position:0%
in the the Automobiles and the
 
02:47:49.550 --> 02:47:49.560 align:start position:0%
capabilities that we have today um
 
02:47:50.990 --> 02:47:51.000 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to think of the non-ss sling
 
02:47:52.590 --> 02:47:52.600 align:start position:0%
term to
 
02:47:55.150 --> 02:47:55.160 align:start position:0%
describe Japanese manufactured
 
02:47:55.160 --> 02:47:56.910 align:start position:0%
describe Japanese manufactured
motorcycles

02:47:56.910 --> 02:47:56.920 align:start position:0%
motorcycles
 
02:48:00.630 --> 02:48:00.640 align:start position:0%
okay Kawasaki Yamahas those those
 
02:48:02.950 --> 02:48:02.960 align:start position:0%
towards type of bikes there's nothing
 
02:48:05.309 --> 02:48:05.319 align:start position:0%
closer in a in commercial purchasing
 
02:48:09.309 --> 02:48:09.319 align:start position:0%
from a full-on race vehicle to a
 
02:48:12.590 --> 02:48:12.600 align:start position:0%
 purchasing vehicle than those type
 
02:48:15.030 --> 02:48:15.040 align:start position:0%
of motorcycles like very little
 
02:48:17.670 --> 02:48:17.680 align:start position:0%
difference so you know and we've had
 
02:48:20.630 --> 02:48:20.640 align:start position:0%
I've lost a League actually on on 93 on
 
02:48:24.670 --> 02:48:24.680 align:start position:0%
one of those U Back 20 25 years ago so
 
02:48:27.630 --> 02:48:27.640 align:start position:0%
you know we we've experienced the
 
02:48:30.110 --> 02:48:30.120 align:start position:0%
capabilities since the ninja came out
 
02:48:32.550 --> 02:48:32.560 align:start position:0%
that that we have that problem what that
 
02:48:34.790 --> 02:48:34.800 align:start position:0%
but a motor you know motorcyclists have
 
02:48:36.790 --> 02:48:36.800 align:start position:0%
a tendency to in some ways when you
 
02:48:38.269 --> 02:48:38.279 align:start position:0%
start to get to speeds like that they
 
02:48:40.389 --> 02:48:40.399 align:start position:0%
kind of are steering their own destiny
 
02:48:43.670 --> 02:48:43.680 align:start position:0%
this is now translated over into pickup
 
02:48:47.510 --> 02:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
trucks and Buicks and sedans and Camry
 
02:48:49.910 --> 02:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
and things that really back in the 80s
 
02:48:52.950 --> 02:48:52.960 align:start position:0%
were running at about 85 horsepower and
 
02:48:55.670 --> 02:48:55.680 align:start position:0%
would do 65 but you didn't you didn't
 
02:48:58.790 --> 02:48:58.800 align:start position:0%
really like it if you got above 75 so
 
02:49:00.230 --> 02:49:00.240 align:start position:0%
you know it's a matter of changing with
 
02:49:01.790 --> 02:49:01.800 align:start position:0%
the times I suppose a little bit here
 
02:49:03.309 --> 02:49:03.319 align:start position:0%
and the in the advancements and
 
02:49:04.990 --> 02:49:05.000 align:start position:0%
Technology of both road construction and
 
02:49:05.000 --> 02:49:06.670 align:start position:0%
Technology of both road construction and
automobile

02:49:06.670 --> 02:49:06.680 align:start position:0%
automobile
 
02:49:09.269 --> 02:49:09.279 align:start position:0%
manufacturing thank you anything
 
02:49:14.950 --> 02:49:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:17.790 --> 02:49:17.800 align:start position:0%
M as you went as you went about thinking
 
02:49:20.070 --> 02:49:20.080 align:start position:0%
about penalty fees uh for the bill one
 
02:49:22.990 --> 02:49:23.000 align:start position:0%
of the things that I'm interested in is
 
02:49:24.870 --> 02:49:24.880 align:start position:0%
did you find any evidence along the way
 
02:49:27.630 --> 02:49:27.640 align:start position:0%
that the changing or increasing the fine
 
02:49:30.190 --> 02:49:30.200 align:start position:0%
would have a dramatic impact on behavior
 
02:49:32.550 --> 02:49:32.560 align:start position:0%
and I'm thinking especially of that
 
02:49:35.349 --> 02:49:35.359 align:start position:0%
person who buys the 800 horsepower car
 
02:49:37.389 --> 02:49:37.399 align:start position:0%
probably can afford you know whatever
 
02:49:40.550 --> 02:49:40.560 align:start position:0%
the increase in the fine is so are we
 
02:49:43.229 --> 02:49:43.239 align:start position:0%
really changing Behavior with the fine
 
02:49:45.429 --> 02:49:45.439 align:start position:0%
well I mean the the like I said the the
 
02:49:48.269 --> 02:49:48.279 align:start position:0%
intent here is to provide a mechanism to
 
02:49:49.910 --> 02:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
Inc increase
 
02:49:55.870 --> 02:49:55.880 align:start position:0%
enforcement okay um you know I the state
 
02:49:58.590 --> 02:49:58.600 align:start position:0%
police have a lot of struggles right now
 
02:50:01.990 --> 02:50:02.000 align:start position:0%
in Staffing levels and um you know
 
02:50:06.030 --> 02:50:06.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:10.070 --> 02:50:10.080 align:start position:0%
thin using a mechanism of a of a non-aps
 
02:50:11.630 --> 02:50:11.640 align:start position:0%
fund to
 
02:50:15.670 --> 02:50:15.680 align:start position:0%
provide um more
 
02:50:18.750 --> 02:50:18.760 align:start position:0%
opportunities for them
 
02:50:22.070 --> 02:50:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:26.389 --> 02:50:26.399 align:start position:0%
overwhelming goal of the
 
02:50:29.550 --> 02:50:29.560 align:start position:0%
administration to bring law enforcement
 
02:50:31.630 --> 02:50:31.640 align:start position:0%
back up to full strength there's it's
 
02:50:34.910 --> 02:50:34.920 align:start position:0%
multifaceted but this is just another
 
02:50:35.990 --> 02:50:36.000 align:start position:0%
you know not I don't think anybody's
 
02:50:37.150 --> 02:50:37.160 align:start position:0%
going to join the state police so that
 
02:50:38.349 --> 02:50:38.359 align:start position:0%
they can work overtime in a speed
 
02:50:39.790 --> 02:50:39.800 align:start position:0%
enforcement Zone but I think it's just
 
02:50:42.269 --> 02:50:42.279 align:start position:0%
something else that adds to the plate of
 
02:50:45.349 --> 02:50:45.359 align:start position:0%
opportunities that they have um you know
 
02:50:47.790 --> 02:50:47.800 align:start position:0%
we as we as we're in budget season and
 
02:50:50.110 --> 02:50:50.120 align:start position:0%
we look at the financial implications of
 
02:50:52.830 --> 02:50:52.840 align:start position:0%
everything that we do here this
 
02:50:54.990 --> 02:50:55.000 align:start position:0%
particular mechanism is self-funded it's
 
02:50:58.590 --> 02:50:58.600 align:start position:0%
not a budgetary impact thing and again
 
02:51:00.510 --> 02:51:00.520 align:start position:0%
if they're not if we're not pulling
 
02:51:02.349 --> 02:51:02.359 align:start position:0%
people over and we're not issuing
 
02:51:04.990 --> 02:51:05.000 align:start position:0%
tickets for folks that are exceeding
 
02:51:08.110 --> 02:51:08.120 align:start position:0%
these numbers then the fund has no money
 
02:51:10.870 --> 02:51:10.880 align:start position:0%
and they but we we're well aware that
 
02:51:14.990 --> 02:51:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:15.000 --> 02:51:16.510 align:start position:0%
 
go

02:51:16.510 --> 02:51:16.520 align:start position:0%
go
 
02:51:18.630 --> 02:51:18.640 align:start position:0%
repr thank you Mr chair and thanks for
 
02:51:23.229 --> 02:51:23.239 align:start position:0%
take my question um I am wondering about
 
02:51:25.870 --> 02:51:25.880 align:start position:0%
um letting people know so you know
 
02:51:27.389 --> 02:51:27.399 align:start position:0%
increasing awareness around it in the
 
02:51:28.910 --> 02:51:28.920 align:start position:0%
first place so that you know I would
 
02:51:30.910 --> 02:51:30.920 align:start position:0%
hope that people wouldn't um find out
 
02:51:32.670 --> 02:51:32.680 align:start position:0%
when they get pulled over but rather be
 
02:51:36.469 --> 02:51:36.479 align:start position:0%
deterred from speeding right so well um
 
02:51:37.910 --> 02:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
you know as far as I know on the border
 
02:51:41.110 --> 02:51:41.120 align:start position:0%
of of 93 we we don't have any signs that
 
02:51:43.630 --> 02:51:43.640 align:start position:0%
say we don't really enforce speed limits
 
02:51:45.469 --> 02:51:45.479 align:start position:0%
I mean we're not you know we're not
 
02:51:47.190 --> 02:51:47.200 align:start position:0%
trying to advertise that hey you know
 
02:51:48.990 --> 02:51:49.000 align:start position:0%
just kind of rock on here go to Five
 
02:51:51.110 --> 02:51:51.120 align:start position:0%
lanes and Sal them let's go you know so
 
02:51:51.120 --> 02:51:52.630 align:start position:0%
lanes and Sal them let's go you know so
I

02:51:52.630 --> 02:51:52.640 align:start position:0%
I
 
02:51:56.229 --> 02:51:56.239 align:start position:0%
mean for I for us to advertise hey we
 
02:51:58.229 --> 02:51:58.239 align:start position:0%
actually enforce our speed limits
 
02:52:01.590 --> 02:52:01.600 align:start position:0%
I I'm not really sure how like well I
 
02:52:03.030 --> 02:52:03.040 align:start position:0%
think uh what you know when you talk
 
02:52:06.269 --> 02:52:06.279 align:start position:0%
about a an enhanced uh enforcement Zone
 
02:52:08.030 --> 02:52:08.040 align:start position:0%
you know some of those would be if
 
02:52:10.469 --> 02:52:10.479 align:start position:0%
there's construction going on or um for
 
02:52:12.870 --> 02:52:12.880 align:start position:0%
one reason or another if there are um
 
02:52:14.229 --> 02:52:14.239 align:start position:0%
there's a reason for people to need to
 
02:52:16.990 --> 02:52:17.000 align:start position:0%
slow down so we do you know there's
 
02:52:19.389 --> 02:52:19.399 align:start position:0%
signs that warn people of that I'm just
 
02:52:20.950 --> 02:52:20.960 align:start position:0%
wondering if well I mean if they want to
 
02:52:22.150 --> 02:52:22.160 align:start position:0%
put you know if the Department of
 
02:52:23.670 --> 02:52:23.680 align:start position:0%
Transportation under our wonderful
 
02:52:26.110 --> 02:52:26.120 align:start position:0%
French welcome sign wants to put you
 
02:52:29.030 --> 02:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
know enhanced speed enforcement area
 
02:52:30.590 --> 02:52:30.600 align:start position:0%
signs I mean that's up to perview the
 
02:52:31.710 --> 02:52:31.720 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation if they
 
02:52:33.950 --> 02:52:33.960 align:start position:0%
want to advertise that or not I I I
 
02:52:35.870 --> 02:52:35.880 align:start position:0%
don't know that saying hey please comply
 
02:52:38.150 --> 02:52:38.160 align:start position:0%
with our law signs are necessary I
 
02:52:39.790 --> 02:52:39.800 align:start position:0%
suppose well they I believe they already
 
02:52:41.990 --> 02:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
do it with like airplanes they say are
 
02:52:45.349 --> 02:52:45.359 align:start position:0%
in force and radar and force so I mean
 
02:52:47.150 --> 02:52:47.160 align:start position:0%
some more some more vital stickers on a
 
02:52:48.870 --> 02:52:48.880 align:start position:0%
piece of metal I don't think that we
 
02:52:50.309 --> 02:52:50.319 align:start position:0%
would get involved in legislating that
 
02:52:51.710 --> 02:52:51.720 align:start position:0%
though I think that they would determine
 
02:52:54.309 --> 02:52:54.319 align:start position:0%
and frankly um I think the advertisement
 
02:52:56.389 --> 02:52:56.399 align:start position:0%
would be in the media once we if we were
 
02:52:58.190 --> 02:52:58.200 align:start position:0%
to enact such a law sure the Department
 
02:52:59.429 --> 02:52:59.439 align:start position:0%
of Transportation the state police they
 
02:53:01.389 --> 02:53:01.399 align:start position:0%
all have websites they all have Avenues
 
02:53:04.990 --> 02:53:05.000 align:start position:0%
to disseminate information I mean okay
 
02:53:05.000 --> 02:53:06.510 align:start position:0%
to disseminate information I mean okay
thank

02:53:06.510 --> 02:53:06.520 align:start position:0%
thank
 
02:53:12.429 --> 02:53:12.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:23.389 --> 02:53:23.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:26.950 --> 02:53:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:30.309 --> 02:53:30.319 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you to the members of
 
02:53:32.910 --> 02:53:32.920 align:start position:0%
the committee uh my name is Matt amuchi
 
02:53:34.550 --> 02:53:34.560 align:start position:0%
I am here representing the New Hampshire
 
02:53:38.190 --> 02:53:38.200 align:start position:0%
State Police uh we are neutral um on
 
02:53:40.309 --> 02:53:40.319 align:start position:0%
this bill and I just want to go over
 
02:53:42.469 --> 02:53:42.479 align:start position:0%
some some statistics and some other
 
02:53:44.790 --> 02:53:44.800 align:start position:0%
information that I have so uh first off
 
02:53:46.830 --> 02:53:46.840 align:start position:0%
the state police is appreciative of the
 
02:53:49.670 --> 02:53:49.680 align:start position:0%
fact that uh speed VI ators are viewed
 
02:53:52.389 --> 02:53:52.399 align:start position:0%
as an issue throughout the state um we
 
02:53:53.550 --> 02:53:53.560 align:start position:0%
recognize that there has been an
 
02:53:55.750 --> 02:53:55.760 align:start position:0%
increase in speed violators throughout
 
02:53:58.469 --> 02:53:58.479 align:start position:0%
the state over the past several years uh
 
02:54:02.630 --> 02:54:02.640 align:start position:0%
from 2022 to 2024 there has been a 39%
 
02:54:05.429 --> 02:54:05.439 align:start position:0%
increase in sumes issued for Speed
 
02:54:07.630 --> 02:54:07.640 align:start position:0%
related offenses 15 plus miles an hour
 
02:54:10.190 --> 02:54:10.200 align:start position:0%
over the posted speed limit in 65 plus M
 
02:54:13.070 --> 02:54:13.080 align:start position:0%
hour zones and during that time same
 
02:54:16.229 --> 02:54:16.239 align:start position:0%
time frame uh 39% increase in summons is
 
02:54:20.070 --> 02:54:20.080 align:start position:0%
issued in um I'm sorry 36% increase in
 
02:54:23.150 --> 02:54:23.160 align:start position:0%
summons is issued uh for 15 mes hour
 
02:54:27.309 --> 02:54:27.319 align:start position:0%
over in 55 and less M hour zones so we
 
02:54:30.429 --> 02:54:30.439 align:start position:0%
are seeing a drastic increase in
 
02:54:33.110 --> 02:54:33.120 align:start position:0%
violators but we're trying to address it
 
02:54:37.150 --> 02:54:37.160 align:start position:0%
as best we can with um citations
 
02:54:39.790 --> 02:54:39.800 align:start position:0%
issued um even with the increased number
 
02:54:41.349 --> 02:54:41.359 align:start position:0%
of citations being issued by State
 
02:54:43.030 --> 02:54:43.040 align:start position:0%
Police over the past three years there's
 
02:54:45.190 --> 02:54:45.200 align:start position:0%
been little change to driving
 
02:54:47.469 --> 02:54:47.479 align:start position:0%
behavior if the intent of this bill is
 
02:54:50.190 --> 02:54:50.200 align:start position:0%
to act as a deter by increasing fines it
 
02:54:51.910 --> 02:54:51.920 align:start position:0%
could be accomplished by increasing the
 
02:54:56.910 --> 02:54:56.920 align:start position:0%
uniform fine schedule for 55 60 65 70 M
 
02:54:56.920 --> 02:54:57.790 align:start position:0%
uniform fine schedule for 55 60 65 70 M
hour

02:54:57.790 --> 02:54:57.800 align:start position:0%
hour
 
02:55:00.870 --> 02:55:00.880 align:start position:0%
zones um by
 
02:55:03.469 --> 02:55:03.479 align:start position:0%
50% did you um and I don't want to
 
02:55:05.510 --> 02:55:05.520 align:start position:0%
interrupt but since you brought it up
 
02:55:07.070 --> 02:55:07.080 align:start position:0%
did you hear the question I asked with
 
02:55:08.910 --> 02:55:08.920 align:start position:0%
regard to the structure of how we we
 
02:55:10.830 --> 02:55:10.840 align:start position:0%
structure our speeding fines versus how
 
02:55:13.950 --> 02:55:13.960 align:start position:0%
mass does it I did what do you what are
 
02:55:15.469 --> 02:55:15.479 align:start position:0%
your thoughts on that do you think our
 
02:55:17.389 --> 02:55:17.399 align:start position:0%
structure the way it's set up is is the
 
02:55:19.070 --> 02:55:19.080 align:start position:0%
best or do you think we we should look
 
02:55:22.670 --> 02:55:22.680 align:start position:0%
at changing that I think it could be
 
02:55:24.910 --> 02:55:24.920 align:start position:0%
Revisited we haven't I don't believe
 
02:55:28.229 --> 02:55:28.239 align:start position:0%
adjusted our fines in number of years
 
02:55:30.550 --> 02:55:30.560 align:start position:0%
and A lot's changed over the last five
 
02:55:32.670 --> 02:55:32.680 align:start position:0%
um the uniform fine schedule hasn't been
 
02:55:38.950 --> 02:55:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:38.960 --> 02:55:40.710 align:start position:0%
 
anyways

02:55:40.710 --> 02:55:40.720 align:start position:0%
anyways
 
02:55:43.750 --> 02:55:43.760 align:start position:0%
um those funds could still be allocated
 
02:55:48.349 --> 02:55:48.359 align:start position:0%
as the committee deems um appropriate
 
02:55:51.950 --> 02:55:51.960 align:start position:0%
I think a more effective um change to
 
02:55:51.960 --> 02:55:52.990 align:start position:0%
I think a more effective um change to
driving

02:55:52.990 --> 02:55:53.000 align:start position:0%
driving
 
02:55:55.710 --> 02:55:55.720 align:start position:0%
behavior um it may be beneficial to look
 
02:56:00.630 --> 02:56:00.640 align:start position:0%
at crash data and speed data um on our
 
02:56:04.030 --> 02:56:04.040 align:start position:0%
highways and strategically post enhanced
 
02:56:06.750 --> 02:56:06.760 align:start position:0%
enforcement zones as you had previously
 
02:56:09.750 --> 02:56:09.760 align:start position:0%
stated um those warning signs could read
 
02:56:12.309 --> 02:56:12.319 align:start position:0%
something to the effect of high crash
 
02:56:14.990 --> 02:56:15.000 align:start position:0%
area ahead um speeding strictly enforced
 
02:56:17.670 --> 02:56:17.680 align:start position:0%
fines increased by 50% I do think that
 
02:56:17.680 --> 02:56:19.030 align:start position:0%
fines increased by 50% I do think that
education

02:56:19.030 --> 02:56:19.040 align:start position:0%
education
 
02:56:23.750 --> 02:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
um warnings will help deter um fines
 
02:56:26.710 --> 02:56:26.720 align:start position:0%
also are used as a deterrent but I think
 
02:56:28.670 --> 02:56:28.680 align:start position:0%
in this case specifically on our
 
02:56:31.190 --> 02:56:31.200 align:start position:0%
highways looking at data as it relates
 
02:56:34.710 --> 02:56:34.720 align:start position:0%
to crashes and speed um and posting
 
02:56:35.910 --> 02:56:35.920 align:start position:0%
those areas like you do with
 
02:56:38.750 --> 02:56:38.760 align:start position:0%
construction zones may be
 
02:56:38.760 --> 02:56:40.750 align:start position:0%
construction zones may be
effective

02:56:40.750 --> 02:56:40.760 align:start position:0%
effective
 
02:56:43.190 --> 02:56:43.200 align:start position:0%
um and this bill was not proposed by the
 
02:56:45.030 --> 02:56:45.040 align:start position:0%
state police we're neutral on where the
 
02:56:47.750 --> 02:56:47.760 align:start position:0%
enhanced speed zone fund is appropriated
 
02:56:48.910 --> 02:56:48.920 align:start position:0%
um whether it's to the Department of
 
02:56:52.389 --> 02:56:52.399 align:start position:0%
Safety the general fund or otherwise um
 
02:56:54.190 --> 02:56:54.200 align:start position:0%
I appreciate the Innovative thinking as
 
02:56:56.590 --> 02:56:56.600 align:start position:0%
to how some of these funds could be
 
02:57:00.389 --> 02:57:00.399 align:start position:0%
utilized to um support the initiative of
 
02:57:04.469 --> 02:57:04.479 align:start position:0%
of speeding uh violators uh so with that
 
02:57:06.830 --> 02:57:06.840 align:start position:0%
I'll be glad to try to answer any
 
02:57:09.870 --> 02:57:09.880 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Captain um could you
 
02:57:12.590 --> 02:57:12.600 align:start position:0%
explain to the committee how it works
 
02:57:16.790 --> 02:57:16.800 align:start position:0%
with regard to warnings um specifically
 
02:57:19.950 --> 02:57:19.960 align:start position:0%
if you were operating one of these zones
 
02:57:22.710 --> 02:57:22.720 align:start position:0%
and um the lodg just came into effect I
 
02:57:24.269 --> 02:57:24.279 align:start position:0%
I assume that there would be some type
 
02:57:25.670 --> 02:57:25.680 align:start position:0%
of directive for a little bit of a
 
02:57:27.750 --> 02:57:27.760 align:start position:0%
period of um warning
 
02:57:31.030 --> 02:57:31.040 align:start position:0%
people when you give someone a warning
 
02:57:32.750 --> 02:57:32.760 align:start position:0%
and then that person's pulled over two
 
02:57:35.110 --> 02:57:35.120 align:start position:0%
weeks later by another Trooper what do
 
02:57:37.469 --> 02:57:37.479 align:start position:0%
they see you could see their motor
 
02:57:39.670 --> 02:57:39.680 align:start position:0%
vehicle history
 
02:57:43.870 --> 02:57:43.880 align:start position:0%
um in in our in-house system yeah local
 
02:57:46.070 --> 02:57:46.080 align:start position:0%
agencies many of them use a different
 
02:57:49.550 --> 02:57:49.560 align:start position:0%
system they can see local history to
 
02:57:51.429 --> 02:57:51.439 align:start position:0%
local history we're on a different
 
02:57:54.389 --> 02:57:54.399 align:start position:0%
system than many agencies um so we can't
 
02:57:56.349 --> 02:57:56.359 align:start position:0%
always see if they were warned in a a
 
02:58:00.309 --> 02:58:00.319 align:start position:0%
local town or city um
 
02:58:02.590 --> 02:58:02.600 align:start position:0%
necessarily but what does the warning
 
02:58:04.590 --> 02:58:04.600 align:start position:0%
say does it say warning for speeding
 
02:58:06.229 --> 02:58:06.239 align:start position:0%
correct so you'll know what they were
 
02:58:07.910 --> 02:58:07.920 align:start position:0%
warned for you know what they're warned
 
02:58:11.110 --> 02:58:11.120 align:start position:0%
for um in the zone or whatever the
 
02:58:13.590 --> 02:58:13.600 align:start position:0%
infraction was but not necessarily how
 
02:58:14.790 --> 02:58:14.800 align:start position:0%
fast they were
 
02:58:17.309 --> 02:58:17.319 align:start position:0%
going um one other question I had is
 
02:58:18.710 --> 02:58:18.720 align:start position:0%
regarding insurance Insurance in New
 
02:58:20.429 --> 02:58:20.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we don't require all drivers
 
02:58:21.670 --> 02:58:21.680 align:start position:0%
to have
 
02:58:24.670 --> 02:58:24.680 align:start position:0%
insurance one of the big deterrents um
 
02:58:26.790 --> 02:58:26.800 align:start position:0%
in my mind is you get a speeding ticket
 
02:58:28.590 --> 02:58:28.600 align:start position:0%
your insurance goes up
 
02:58:30.870 --> 02:58:30.880 align:start position:0%
significantly if you're not required to
 
02:58:33.510 --> 02:58:33.520 align:start position:0%
have insurance that doesn't really
 
02:58:36.710 --> 02:58:36.720 align:start position:0%
impact you um at what point are you
 
02:58:38.110 --> 02:58:38.120 align:start position:0%
required to get insurance in New
 
02:58:39.910 --> 02:58:39.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is it only after an accident
 
02:58:41.309 --> 02:58:41.319 align:start position:0%
where you're at fall or is it can it
 
02:58:43.550 --> 02:58:43.560 align:start position:0%
also be for
 
02:58:45.750 --> 02:58:45.760 align:start position:0%
violations I know for for accidents
 
02:58:48.590 --> 02:58:48.600 align:start position:0%
you're required to to have insurance um
 
02:58:51.070 --> 02:58:51.080 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if you hit x amount of
 
02:58:52.429 --> 02:58:52.439 align:start position:0%
points if you're required to I'm not
 
02:58:54.269 --> 02:58:54.279 align:start position:0%
aware of that okay thank you I think
 
02:58:56.710 --> 02:58:56.720 align:start position:0%
that's something to look at because I
 
02:58:58.870 --> 02:58:58.880 align:start position:0%
know for me I would be the ticket would
 
02:59:00.870 --> 02:59:00.880 align:start position:0%
be painful but what would be devastating
 
02:59:03.110 --> 02:59:03.120 align:start position:0%
is the insurance um increase over the
 
02:59:06.590 --> 02:59:06.600 align:start position:0%
next five years um which is exponential
 
02:59:08.429 --> 02:59:08.439 align:start position:0%
so if someone doesn't have insurance
 
02:59:09.550 --> 02:59:09.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter to them they pay the
 
02:59:11.910 --> 02:59:11.920 align:start position:0%
ticket and they move on so thank you um
 
02:59:13.389 --> 02:59:13.399 align:start position:0%
any other questions for Captain yes
 
02:59:13.399 --> 02:59:15.309 align:start position:0%
any other questions for Captain yes
representative

02:59:15.309 --> 02:59:15.319 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:59:18.269 --> 02:59:18.279 align:start position:0%
Newman yeah I have a question for
 
02:59:20.030 --> 02:59:20.040 align:start position:0%
question on one of the things that the
 
02:59:24.030 --> 02:59:24.040 align:start position:0%
chair said about um speed check by
 
02:59:27.630 --> 02:59:27.640 align:start position:0%
aircraft do you have any data or
 
02:59:29.910 --> 02:59:29.920 align:start position:0%
anecdotal information
 
02:59:32.429 --> 02:59:32.439 align:start position:0%
on how whether that's a deterrent or you
 
02:59:34.950 --> 02:59:34.960 align:start position:0%
find that out as a deterrent it seems to
 
02:59:36.590 --> 02:59:36.600 align:start position:0%
me that when I think some of the
 
02:59:37.870 --> 02:59:37.880 align:start position:0%
aircraft's up there and I don't know
 
02:59:39.070 --> 02:59:39.080 align:start position:0%
whether he there or not it may be
 
02:59:40.670 --> 02:59:40.680 align:start position:0%
because they used to do air traffic
 
02:59:44.389 --> 02:59:44.399 align:start position:0%
stuff that I say this is if I were
 
02:59:48.670 --> 02:59:48.680 align:start position:0%
intending to go faster I would slow down
 
02:59:50.349 --> 02:59:50.359 align:start position:0%
yes sir what do you think about that yes
 
02:59:53.309 --> 02:59:53.319 align:start position:0%
sir thank you for the question um yes
 
02:59:56.190 --> 02:59:56.200 align:start position:0%
our our aircraft is extremely effective
 
02:59:58.510 --> 02:59:58.520 align:start position:0%
um those signs that you see are
 
03:00:00.750 --> 03:00:00.760 align:start position:0%
typically warning operators once they've
 
03:00:03.429 --> 03:00:03.439 align:start position:0%
traveled through what we're looking at
 
03:00:06.830 --> 03:00:06.840 align:start position:0%
to warn you that there there are going
 
03:00:09.830 --> 03:00:09.840 align:start position:0%
to be officers on the side of the road
 
03:00:12.309 --> 03:00:12.319 align:start position:0%
um that's not warning you that to slow
 
03:00:13.990 --> 03:00:14.000 align:start position:0%
down at that point it's it's warning you
 
03:00:15.349 --> 03:00:15.359 align:start position:0%
that there's going to be several
 
03:00:17.510 --> 03:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
Troopers ahead of you that have already
 
03:00:18.790 --> 03:00:18.800 align:start position:0%
stopped vehicles but you've already
 
03:00:20.830 --> 03:00:20.840 align:start position:0%
traveled through that zone you know
 
03:00:22.389 --> 03:00:22.399 align:start position:0%
those four zones that we're we're
 
03:00:24.269 --> 03:00:24.279 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
03:00:28.229 --> 03:00:28.239 align:start position:0%
um so yes we're we're warning there is a
 
03:00:30.389 --> 03:00:30.399 align:start position:0%
deterrent we're trying to slow operators
 
03:00:31.830 --> 03:00:31.840 align:start position:0%
down and have them move over because
 
03:00:33.389 --> 03:00:33.399 align:start position:0%
we're going to be stopped on the side of
 
03:00:40.710 --> 03:00:40.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:43.550 --> 03:00:43.560 align:start position:0%
point I just think that it may may be a
 
03:00:45.190 --> 03:00:45.200 align:start position:0%
deterrent when you're not even around
 
03:00:46.870 --> 03:00:46.880 align:start position:0%
you know that's anyway but I'll go on to
 
03:00:48.550 --> 03:00:48.560 align:start position:0%
my question
 
03:00:52.190 --> 03:00:52.200 align:start position:0%
um you you mentioned that an accident
 
03:00:54.670 --> 03:00:54.680 align:start position:0%
causes an increase in insurance I'm I'm
 
03:00:57.790 --> 03:00:57.800 align:start position:0%
just curious how that works I know that
 
03:01:00.590 --> 03:01:00.600 align:start position:0%
trying to get a law to pass Insurance
 
03:01:02.190 --> 03:01:02.200 align:start position:0%
the insurance companies don't like that
 
03:01:03.950 --> 03:01:03.960 align:start position:0%
because they don't want it to be
 
03:01:05.550 --> 03:01:05.560 align:start position:0%
mandatory especially a minimum because
 
03:01:07.469 --> 03:01:07.479 align:start position:0%
they don't make any money do you have
 
03:01:09.990 --> 03:01:10.000 align:start position:0%
any um just explain to me why what what
 
03:01:12.469 --> 03:01:12.479 align:start position:0%
happens after an accident so from my
 
03:01:13.550 --> 03:01:13.560 align:start position:0%
understanding is once you're involved in
 
03:01:15.030 --> 03:01:15.040 align:start position:0%
an accident in the state you're then
 
03:01:18.429 --> 03:01:18.439 align:start position:0%
required to have insurance um whether it
 
03:01:20.830 --> 03:01:20.840 align:start position:0%
in increases that's up to the insurance
 
03:01:23.389 --> 03:01:23.399 align:start position:0%
company um we do get complaints often
 
03:01:27.269 --> 03:01:27.279 align:start position:0%
from um those sou of us because of
 
03:01:28.710 --> 03:01:28.720 align:start position:0%
because of just that their insurance is
 
03:01:30.190 --> 03:01:30.200 align:start position:0%
going to go up for for five years
 
03:01:32.630 --> 03:01:32.640 align:start position:0%
hundreds of dollars per year they're not
 
03:01:35.750 --> 03:01:35.760 align:start position:0%
concerned with a $500 ticket they're
 
03:01:36.910 --> 03:01:36.920 align:start position:0%
concerned with the fact it's going to
 
03:01:39.510 --> 03:01:39.520 align:start position:0%
cost them $3,000 over the next five
 
03:01:43.269 --> 03:01:43.279 align:start position:0%
years because of um the increase to
 
03:01:44.830 --> 03:01:44.840 align:start position:0%
answer your previous question there are
 
03:01:48.590 --> 03:01:48.600 align:start position:0%
states that have um a fixed signs along
 
03:01:50.150 --> 03:01:50.160 align:start position:0%
the highway saying that the that the
 
03:01:52.190 --> 03:01:52.200 align:start position:0%
highway is monitored by aircraft and
 
03:01:54.349 --> 03:01:54.359 align:start position:0%
those stay up year round whether there's
 
03:01:56.349 --> 03:01:56.359 align:start position:0%
aircraft or not we just have the the
 
03:01:58.830 --> 03:01:58.840 align:start position:0%
temporary ones while we're out enforcing
 
03:02:01.469 --> 03:02:01.479 align:start position:0%
these that um and that's more to warn
 
03:02:03.030 --> 03:02:03.040 align:start position:0%
operators that ahead of you you're going
 
03:02:06.269 --> 03:02:06.279 align:start position:0%
to have multiple Cruisers and we do see
 
03:02:08.429 --> 03:02:08.439 align:start position:0%
Vehicles slow down at that point move
 
03:02:12.269 --> 03:02:12.279 align:start position:0%
over um because we don't want to have
 
03:02:14.510 --> 03:02:14.520 align:start position:0%
accidents or get struck by by passing
 
03:02:16.510 --> 03:02:16.520 align:start position:0%
motorists we might need the permanent
 
03:02:20.110 --> 03:02:20.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:22.910 --> 03:02:22.920 align:start position:0%
sir representative new
 
03:02:24.990 --> 03:02:25.000 align:start position:0%
new thank you Mr chair and thanks for
 
03:02:28.830 --> 03:02:28.840 align:start position:0%
taking my question um I H as you know
 
03:02:31.870 --> 03:02:31.880 align:start position:0%
the mom of um two kids who are one just
 
03:02:33.070 --> 03:02:33.080 align:start position:0%
got his license and the other one is
 
03:02:36.510 --> 03:02:36.520 align:start position:0%
coming up um keenly aware um that we
 
03:02:40.429 --> 03:02:40.439 align:start position:0%
have um a serious issue with youth um
 
03:02:42.469 --> 03:02:42.479 align:start position:0%
accidents and and even deaths and things
 
03:02:44.110 --> 03:02:44.120 align:start position:0%
like that and so hearing a whole lot
 
03:02:46.190 --> 03:02:46.200 align:start position:0%
about that generally speaking what I've
 
03:02:48.750 --> 03:02:48.760 align:start position:0%
heard is that it is mostly distracted
 
03:02:51.150 --> 03:02:51.160 align:start position:0%
driving or I'm just curious if if you
 
03:02:55.110 --> 03:02:55.120 align:start position:0%
have any um uh if you have any data or
 
03:02:56.790 --> 03:02:56.800 align:start position:0%
anything like that to say that speed
 
03:02:59.309 --> 03:02:59.319 align:start position:0%
might be a part of that or have you seen
 
03:03:03.469 --> 03:03:03.479 align:start position:0%
that um speed is a part of the um youth
 
03:03:07.429 --> 03:03:07.439 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry my trying to say it um part of
 
03:03:10.349 --> 03:03:10.359 align:start position:0%
um the reason why we are having so many
 
03:03:13.990 --> 03:03:14.000 align:start position:0%
um accidents with the youth I'm sorry
 
03:03:16.469 --> 03:03:16.479 align:start position:0%
you get what I'm saying thank you for
 
03:03:19.389 --> 03:03:19.399 align:start position:0%
the question yes um as it relates to our
 
03:03:22.670 --> 03:03:22.680 align:start position:0%
fatalities um distracted driving
 
03:03:25.269 --> 03:03:25.279 align:start position:0%
impaired driving speed those are the
 
03:03:29.030 --> 03:03:29.040 align:start position:0%
three things that we see in nearly every
 
03:03:31.070 --> 03:03:31.080 align:start position:0%
fatality there are instances where it's
 
03:03:33.750 --> 03:03:33.760 align:start position:0%
medical related um somebody has a
 
03:03:35.309 --> 03:03:35.319 align:start position:0%
seizure while they're driving but the
 
03:03:38.830 --> 03:03:38.840 align:start position:0%
vast majority um that we are seeing it's
 
03:03:41.429 --> 03:03:41.439 align:start position:0%
impairment it's distracted driving and
 
03:03:43.830 --> 03:03:43.840 align:start position:0%
speed related and that's across the
 
03:03:48.950 --> 03:03:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:48.960 --> 03:03:50.750 align:start position:0%
 
representative

03:03:50.750 --> 03:03:50.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:03:53.750 --> 03:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
lell thank you for taking my question uh
 
03:03:56.229 --> 03:03:56.239 align:start position:0%
I'm a great believer in
 
03:03:59.990 --> 03:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
technology um and I'm just wondering uh
 
03:04:03.510 --> 03:04:03.520 align:start position:0%
do you folks um like for instance where
 
03:04:07.190 --> 03:04:07.200 align:start position:0%
the hooks at tolls are all right there
 
03:04:10.670 --> 03:04:10.680 align:start position:0%
are cameras there and uh there's ways of
 
03:04:15.389 --> 03:04:15.399 align:start position:0%
keeping track of um cars if we had
 
03:04:18.550 --> 03:04:18.560 align:start position:0%
another set of just sensors
 
03:04:22.150 --> 03:04:22.160 align:start position:0%
you know north of that maybe 10 miles
 
03:04:25.670 --> 03:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
and if we could keep track of how much
 
03:04:28.750 --> 03:04:28.760 align:start position:0%
time it took a a vehicle to get between
 
03:04:31.910 --> 03:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
that 10 Mile Stretch and if they
 
03:04:34.229 --> 03:04:34.239 align:start position:0%
exceeded a certain amount could we
 
03:04:38.550 --> 03:04:38.560 align:start position:0%
summarily pull these folks over is is
 
03:04:41.030 --> 03:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
there a way that you're looking at
 
03:04:44.830 --> 03:04:44.840 align:start position:0%
technology to act as a
 
03:04:47.950 --> 03:04:47.960 align:start position:0%
deterrent uh great question um not that
 
03:04:49.710 --> 03:04:49.720 align:start position:0%
I'm aware of I mean there's a lot of
 
03:04:51.269 --> 03:04:51.279 align:start position:0%
Technology that's out there you see the
 
03:04:53.950 --> 03:04:53.960 align:start position:0%
red light cameras in other states um you
 
03:04:56.550 --> 03:04:56.560 align:start position:0%
see you know speed obviously when you go
 
03:05:01.030 --> 03:05:01.040 align:start position:0%
through tolls it does track speeds
 
03:05:05.269 --> 03:05:05.279 align:start position:0%
um it it's a great question um I don't
 
03:05:08.070 --> 03:05:08.080 align:start position:0%
have a an answer on on that particular
 
03:05:10.590 --> 03:05:10.600 align:start position:0%
question as far as what technology is is
 
03:05:14.309 --> 03:05:14.319 align:start position:0%
being used we do um test license uh
 
03:05:16.190 --> 03:05:16.200 align:start position:0%
readers but those are more for like
 
03:05:18.950 --> 03:05:18.960 align:start position:0%
stolen vehicles and and things like that
 
03:05:22.110 --> 03:05:22.120 align:start position:0%
um there's there's a lot of Technology
 
03:05:24.269 --> 03:05:24.279 align:start position:0%
out there and it continues to grow how
 
03:05:27.349 --> 03:05:27.359 align:start position:0%
can we effectively utilize that that
 
03:05:29.429 --> 03:05:29.439 align:start position:0%
the citizens of the state are
 
03:05:29.439 --> 03:05:30.790 align:start position:0%
the citizens of the state are
comfortable

03:05:30.790 --> 03:05:30.800 align:start position:0%
comfortable
 
03:05:35.190 --> 03:05:35.200 align:start position:0%
with I'm not sure thank you I can tell
 
03:05:37.510 --> 03:05:37.520 align:start position:0%
you that stoplight cameras are not one
 
03:05:39.950 --> 03:05:39.960 align:start position:0%
of them representative
 
03:05:43.190 --> 03:05:43.200 align:start position:0%
Murray thank you Mr chair um just uh to
 
03:05:45.469 --> 03:05:45.479 align:start position:0%
follow up on that so to clarify do we
 
03:05:48.750 --> 03:05:48.760 align:start position:0%
ever issue like male tickets to People
 
03:05:50.830 --> 03:05:50.840 align:start position:0%
based on like enforcement radar whatever
 
03:05:53.550 --> 03:05:53.560 align:start position:0%
that we may have picked up or is it
 
03:05:55.670 --> 03:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
really just all about like the inperson
 
03:05:57.110 --> 03:05:57.120 align:start position:0%
on the side of the road enforcement is
 
03:06:00.229 --> 03:06:00.239 align:start position:0%
that like the only Avenue yeah it's it's
 
03:06:01.830 --> 03:06:01.840 align:start position:0%
in person there are times where you get
 
03:06:04.510 --> 03:06:04.520 align:start position:0%
mailed a ticket for one reason or
 
03:06:07.830 --> 03:06:07.840 align:start position:0%
another um my printer is not working I
 
03:06:10.550 --> 03:06:10.560 align:start position:0%
can certify mail you a ticket but I have
 
03:06:13.510 --> 03:06:13.520 align:start position:0%
to identify who you are um it's unlike
 
03:06:15.630 --> 03:06:15.640 align:start position:0%
Easy Pass where if you violate it the
 
03:06:16.790 --> 03:06:16.800 align:start position:0%
operator of that vehicle is going to
 
03:06:18.630 --> 03:06:18.640 align:start position:0%
receive a Cit
 
03:06:21.110 --> 03:06:21.120 align:start position:0%
uh or fees in the mail we don't do that
 
03:06:23.670 --> 03:06:23.680 align:start position:0%
as far as uh speed is
 
03:06:26.309 --> 03:06:26.319 align:start position:0%
related what about after accidents
 
03:06:28.389 --> 03:06:28.399 align:start position:0%
sometimes do you mail citations after an
 
03:06:32.510 --> 03:06:32.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:32.520 --> 03:06:34.070 align:start position:0%
 
complete

03:06:34.070 --> 03:06:34.080 align:start position:0%
complete
 
03:06:36.469 --> 03:06:36.479 align:start position:0%
um maybe not that that I'm not sure I
 
03:06:37.830 --> 03:06:37.840 align:start position:0%
mean there's times where we certainly
 
03:06:39.750 --> 03:06:39.760 align:start position:0%
charge them yeah with different things I
 
03:06:41.150 --> 03:06:41.160 align:start position:0%
don't know if we would just mail them a
 
03:06:42.229 --> 03:06:42.239 align:start position:0%
ticket it would probably be a must
 
03:06:44.870 --> 03:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
appear they'd be issued a court date uh
 
03:06:46.150 --> 03:06:46.160 align:start position:0%
and then a complaint would come with
 
03:06:48.670 --> 03:06:48.680 align:start position:0%
that um I'm not sure that they would
 
03:06:52.630 --> 03:06:52.640 align:start position:0%
just be sent a citation in the mail uh
 
03:06:55.429 --> 03:06:55.439 align:start position:0%
upon the completion of a
 
03:06:57.830 --> 03:06:57.840 align:start position:0%
investigation my last question with
 
03:07:02.429 --> 03:07:02.439 align:start position:0%
regard to um speeding and arrest we see
 
03:07:04.510 --> 03:07:04.520 align:start position:0%
a lot of times in the in the media where
 
03:07:07.950 --> 03:07:07.960 align:start position:0%
someone um usually those motorcyclists
 
03:07:09.750 --> 03:07:09.760 align:start position:0%
uh are going a certain amount over the
 
03:07:10.990 --> 03:07:11.000 align:start position:0%
speed limit and they end up being
 
03:07:13.229 --> 03:07:13.239 align:start position:0%
arrested for what is the charge they use
 
03:07:17.070 --> 03:07:17.080 align:start position:0%
to to arrest a a speeding motorist yes
 
03:07:20.870 --> 03:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
sir um Reckless operation so when the
 
03:07:23.590 --> 03:07:23.600 align:start position:0%
when the um law was changed that allowed
 
03:07:25.269 --> 03:07:25.279 align:start position:0%
for if you're traveling 100 miles an
 
03:07:27.070 --> 03:07:27.080 align:start position:0%
hour or more it becomes a reckless
 
03:07:30.150 --> 03:07:30.160 align:start position:0%
operation that is a arrestable offense
 
03:07:31.950 --> 03:07:31.960 align:start position:0%
and does the State Police have a policy
 
03:07:35.150 --> 03:07:35.160 align:start position:0%
as far as um shall arrest or is it
 
03:07:36.389 --> 03:07:36.399 align:start position:0%
really still up to the offic of
 
03:07:38.710 --> 03:07:38.720 align:start position:0%
discretion still up to discretion good
 
03:07:40.670 --> 03:07:40.680 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
03:07:44.269 --> 03:07:44.279 align:start position:0%
rep yeah um if people when people go
 
03:07:47.229 --> 03:07:47.239 align:start position:0%
through the tolls you have a plate and
 
03:07:49.790 --> 03:07:49.800 align:start position:0%
you Can you capture the speed and if you
 
03:07:52.510 --> 03:07:52.520 align:start position:0%
capture a speed that's
 
03:07:55.469 --> 03:07:55.479 align:start position:0%
outrageous can can they is there a law
 
03:07:58.990 --> 03:07:59.000 align:start position:0%
can they sent a violation of some nature
 
03:07:59.000 --> 03:07:59.990 align:start position:0%
can they sent a violation of some nature
just

03:07:59.990 --> 03:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
just
 
03:08:03.229 --> 03:08:03.239 align:start position:0%
curious um thank you for the question um
 
03:08:05.950 --> 03:08:05.960 align:start position:0%
that's all tracked by Easy Pass and it's
 
03:08:08.710 --> 03:08:08.720 align:start position:0%
a separate entity from us um they don't
 
03:08:10.790 --> 03:08:10.800 align:start position:0%
share any of the information with us and
 
03:08:13.030 --> 03:08:13.040 align:start position:0%
anytime that we try to obtain it we have
 
03:08:14.830 --> 03:08:14.840 align:start position:0%
to do a search warrant to get those
 
03:08:18.910 --> 03:08:18.920 align:start position:0%
records thank you
 
03:08:22.510 --> 03:08:22.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:25.269 --> 03:08:25.279 align:start position:0%
Sher three three types of deterrence
 
03:08:28.469 --> 03:08:28.479 align:start position:0%
that I see in this circumstance uh I'm
 
03:08:30.630 --> 03:08:30.640 align:start position:0%
I'm not a big fan of fines as a
 
03:08:33.190 --> 03:08:33.200 align:start position:0%
deterrent it's just a Flatout punishment
 
03:08:35.389 --> 03:08:35.399 align:start position:0%
I I think most people
 
03:08:39.030 --> 03:08:39.040 align:start position:0%
don't um but in with
 
03:08:42.630 --> 03:08:42.640 align:start position:0%
fines increase in insurance loss of
 
03:08:45.510 --> 03:08:45.520 align:start position:0%
license those three are the classic
 
03:08:47.910 --> 03:08:47.920 align:start position:0%
deterrence how are could you give me
 
03:08:50.229 --> 03:08:50.239 align:start position:0%
your judgment as to the effectiveness of
 
03:08:56.870 --> 03:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:00.910 --> 03:09:00.920 align:start position:0%
deterrent um yeah they they would all be
 
03:09:03.190 --> 03:09:03.200 align:start position:0%
viewed as deterrent based on the person
 
03:09:06.070 --> 03:09:06.080 align:start position:0%
you know if if people have the funds
 
03:09:10.229 --> 03:09:10.239 align:start position:0%
then the the monetary loss that they
 
03:09:13.110 --> 03:09:13.120 align:start position:0%
that they face um may not be as
 
03:09:13.120 --> 03:09:14.630 align:start position:0%
that they face um may not be as
impactful

03:09:14.630 --> 03:09:14.640 align:start position:0%
impactful
 
03:09:17.910 --> 03:09:17.920 align:start position:0%
um you know the loss of license that may
 
03:09:20.110 --> 03:09:20.120 align:start position:0%
be more impactful because they're trying
 
03:09:22.389 --> 03:09:22.399 align:start position:0%
to get to work they work for a
 
03:09:24.309 --> 03:09:24.319 align:start position:0%
high-paying job hypothetically if
 
03:09:28.910 --> 03:09:28.920 align:start position:0%
they're um so I I think I think
 
03:09:31.150 --> 03:09:31.160 align:start position:0%
deterrents are important um I think
 
03:09:33.790 --> 03:09:33.800 align:start position:0%
education is important I agree that the
 
03:09:35.630 --> 03:09:35.640 align:start position:0%
vast majority of of the people on our
 
03:09:38.389 --> 03:09:38.399 align:start position:0%
roadways are law abiding citizens that
 
03:09:42.030 --> 03:09:42.040 align:start position:0%
want to do the right thing um have
 
03:09:44.429 --> 03:09:44.439 align:start position:0%
things been you know have we seen an
 
03:09:47.190 --> 03:09:47.200 align:start position:0%
increase in in speed over the years yes
 
03:09:49.830 --> 03:09:49.840 align:start position:0%
um um and that's why bills like this are
 
03:09:52.550 --> 03:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
are good to to take a look at uh work
 
03:09:55.510 --> 03:09:55.520 align:start position:0%
with in an attempt to help combat and
 
03:10:00.229 --> 03:10:00.239 align:start position:0%
get um all operators on our roads um
 
03:10:04.830 --> 03:10:04.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:06.590 --> 03:10:06.600 align:start position:0%
environment thank you for taking our
 
03:10:08.910 --> 03:10:08.920 align:start position:0%
questions today thank you thank you sir

03:11:42.870 --> 03:11:42.880 align:start position:0%
track when you pass through the bed for
 
03:11:44.110 --> 03:11:44.120 align:start position:0%
tools and when you pass through the
 
03:11:46.910 --> 03:11:46.920 align:start position:0%
hooks at tools it's a given distance

03:35:55.150 --> 03:35:55.160 align:start position:0%
places and we have uh you know tourists
 
03:35:56.910 --> 03:35:56.920 align:start position:0%
people coming through our town and we
 
03:36:00.110 --> 03:36:00.120 align:start position:0%
have to enforce uh traffic
 
03:36:02.670 --> 03:36:02.680 align:start position:0%
laws uh when a ticket is written of
 
03:36:04.469 --> 03:36:04.479 align:start position:0%
course it goes to the general fund and a
 
03:36:05.429 --> 03:36:05.439 align:start position:0%
couple other
 
03:36:10.070 --> 03:36:10.080 align:start position:0%
funds um and because you know taxes are
 
03:36:14.070 --> 03:36:14.080 align:start position:0%
tight uh we we could use a little more
 
03:36:16.830 --> 03:36:16.840 align:start position:0%
uh speed enforcement equip
 
03:36:19.349 --> 03:36:19.359 align:start position:0%
so things like radar guns and signs and
 
03:36:23.150 --> 03:36:23.160 align:start position:0%
things like that and so the idea is to
 
03:36:27.309 --> 03:36:27.319 align:start position:0%
direct a small portion of ticket fees to
 
03:36:29.790 --> 03:36:29.800 align:start position:0%
a fund that municipalities around the
 
03:36:33.950 --> 03:36:33.960 align:start position:0%
state can apply for a grant from and
 
03:36:36.389 --> 03:36:36.399 align:start position:0%
that Grant can only be used for a a
 
03:36:38.030 --> 03:36:38.040 align:start position:0%
specific list of things that's mentioned
 
03:36:40.790 --> 03:36:40.800 align:start position:0%
in the bill and that way it you know
 
03:36:43.229 --> 03:36:43.239 align:start position:0%
would spread some of the costs around
 
03:36:46.030 --> 03:36:46.040 align:start position:0%
and make our our streets safer
 
03:36:49.030 --> 03:36:49.040 align:start position:0%
across the state uh that's that's the
 
03:36:51.670 --> 03:36:51.680 align:start position:0%
gist of my testimony happy to answer any
 
03:36:53.630 --> 03:36:53.640 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for bringing us the
 
03:36:56.189 --> 03:36:56.199 align:start position:0%
spill representative um some people I'm
 
03:36:58.710 --> 03:36:58.720 align:start position:0%
sure are going to argue that this may
 
03:37:01.150 --> 03:37:01.160 align:start position:0%
create a per perverse incentive for
 
03:37:03.309 --> 03:37:03.319 align:start position:0%
police to write more tickets so that
 
03:37:04.830 --> 03:37:04.840 align:start position:0%
they can generate more money for more
 
03:37:06.710 --> 03:37:06.720 align:start position:0%
equipment um what would be your response
 
03:37:08.710 --> 03:37:08.720 align:start position:0%
to that yeah so certainly we wouldn't
 
03:37:10.950 --> 03:37:10.960 align:start position:0%
want to have the ticket written locally
 
03:37:12.750 --> 03:37:12.760 align:start position:0%
go to the local Department because that
 
03:37:15.750 --> 03:37:15.760 align:start position:0%
would be a perverse incentive so this
 
03:37:17.950 --> 03:37:17.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't raise or lower fees the fees
 
03:37:20.030 --> 03:37:20.040 align:start position:0%
would still stay the same just a small
 
03:37:23.189 --> 03:37:23.199 align:start position:0%
portion would go to a a pool at the
 
03:37:26.590 --> 03:37:26.600 align:start position:0%
state level um so it be a trickle from
 
03:37:28.630 --> 03:37:28.640 align:start position:0%
all the towns would go into this pool
 
03:37:30.870 --> 03:37:30.880 align:start position:0%
and then the the Departments that might
 
03:37:34.710 --> 03:37:34.720 align:start position:0%
be short of equipment to enforce traffic
 
03:37:37.189 --> 03:37:37.199 align:start position:0%
uh in their location could apply for a
 
03:37:39.790 --> 03:37:39.800 align:start position:0%
grant uh it would be a needs-based
 
03:37:43.229 --> 03:37:43.239 align:start position:0%
program uh and the fund would be
 
03:37:44.950 --> 03:37:44.960 align:start position:0%
distributed to the the towns that need
 
03:37:46.950 --> 03:37:46.960 align:start position:0%
it the most so I think there's enough of
 
03:37:49.309 --> 03:37:49.319 align:start position:0%
a disconnect between yeah the ticket
 
03:37:51.910 --> 03:37:51.920 align:start position:0%
itself and that fund being dispersed
 
03:37:54.910 --> 03:37:54.920 align:start position:0%
that it would not present a perverse
 
03:37:56.429 --> 03:37:56.439 align:start position:0%
incentive yeah it sounds like you have a
 
03:37:58.150 --> 03:37:58.160 align:start position:0%
few firewalls in there you've got the
 
03:38:00.349 --> 03:38:00.359 align:start position:0%
the first one where it's not going
 
03:38:02.469 --> 03:38:02.479 align:start position:0%
directly to the town then it's they have
 
03:38:04.030 --> 03:38:04.040 align:start position:0%
to apply for it they're not even sure if
 
03:38:05.910 --> 03:38:05.920 align:start position:0%
they're going to get it so that much
 
03:38:08.110 --> 03:38:08.120 align:start position:0%
distance would make it very difficult to
 
03:38:09.950 --> 03:38:09.960 align:start position:0%
Target a specific piece of equipment and
 
03:38:11.830 --> 03:38:11.840 align:start position:0%
say we're going to get this this year
 
03:38:16.590 --> 03:38:16.600 align:start position:0%
right oh thank you questions
 
03:38:16.600 --> 03:38:18.070 align:start position:0%
right oh thank you questions
represent

03:38:18.070 --> 03:38:18.080 align:start position:0%
represent
 
03:38:20.910 --> 03:38:20.920 align:start position:0%
PR I see on your list you have automated
 
03:38:20.920 --> 03:38:22.070 align:start position:0%
PR I see on your list you have automated
speed

03:38:22.070 --> 03:38:22.080 align:start position:0%
speed
 
03:38:25.030 --> 03:38:25.040 align:start position:0%
cameras really don't would you be
 
03:38:26.550 --> 03:38:26.560 align:start position:0%
willing to get rid of that because I
 
03:38:29.469 --> 03:38:29.479 align:start position:0%
think that's a slippery slope to go down
 
03:38:32.630 --> 03:38:32.640 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for the question um so as
 
03:38:34.269 --> 03:38:34.279 align:start position:0%
is the custom it's the committee's bill
 
03:38:37.189 --> 03:38:37.199 align:start position:0%
so we're relying on your judgment on how
 
03:38:38.469 --> 03:38:38.479 align:start position:0%
to improve the bill and I would
 
03:38:40.790 --> 03:38:40.800 align:start position:0%
certainly be open to that suggestion
 
03:38:40.800 --> 03:38:42.429 align:start position:0%
certainly be open to that suggestion
thank

03:38:42.429 --> 03:38:42.439 align:start position:0%
thank
 
03:38:45.590 --> 03:38:45.600 align:start position:0%
you thank you any further questions
 
03:38:45.600 --> 03:38:47.309 align:start position:0%
you thank you any further questions
representative

03:38:47.309 --> 03:38:47.319 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:38:49.469 --> 03:38:49.479 align:start position:0%
Sher I'm I'm just looking at the bill
 
03:38:51.950 --> 03:38:51.960 align:start position:0%
now how is it determined how much goes
 
03:38:57.150 --> 03:38:57.160 align:start position:0%
to this uh non-aps fund is there's a
 
03:38:59.870 --> 03:38:59.880 align:start position:0%
it's on the last page of the bill it's
 
03:39:02.910 --> 03:39:02.920 align:start position:0%
uh section two article uh section four
 
03:39:06.870 --> 03:39:06.880 align:start position:0%
Roman number four and so what it's doing
 
03:39:08.510 --> 03:39:08.520 align:start position:0%
is taking the
 
03:39:11.429 --> 03:39:11.439 align:start position:0%
66% that the treasurer would deposit
 
03:39:13.349 --> 03:39:13.359 align:start position:0%
into the general fund and it's reducing
 
03:39:15.750 --> 03:39:15.760 align:start position:0%
that by an amount and it's it's an
 
03:39:17.110 --> 03:39:17.120 align:start position:0%
arbitrary number so that could be
 
03:39:21.229 --> 03:39:21.239 align:start position:0%
adjusted to um and that
 
03:39:24.830 --> 03:39:24.840 align:start position:0%
8.3% would go to this new fund got it
 
03:39:24.840 --> 03:39:27.269 align:start position:0%
8.3% would go to this new fund got it
thank

03:39:27.269 --> 03:39:27.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:29.630 --> 03:39:29.640 align:start position:0%
you see no further questions thank you
 
03:39:32.950 --> 03:39:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:38.389 --> 03:39:38.399 align:start position:0%
you the chair calls um Captain amui
 
03:39:46.630 --> 03:39:46.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:50.030 --> 03:39:50.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and committee
 
03:39:52.990 --> 03:39:53.000 align:start position:0%
members um my name is Matt amuchi within
 
03:39:55.590 --> 03:39:55.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire State Police um we're neutral
 
03:39:58.990 --> 03:39:59.000 align:start position:0%
on this bill as well um this bill would
 
03:40:00.630 --> 03:40:00.640 align:start position:0%
align with the mission of the office of
 
03:40:03.189 --> 03:40:03.199 align:start position:0%
Highway Safety in many ways and I kind
 
03:40:05.309 --> 03:40:05.319 align:start position:0%
of just want to go over what the mission
 
03:40:08.309 --> 03:40:08.319 align:start position:0%
of the office of Highway Safety is um
 
03:40:10.110 --> 03:40:10.120 align:start position:0%
more for educational purposes than
 
03:40:12.469 --> 03:40:12.479 align:start position:0%
anything else so the office of Highway
 
03:40:14.510 --> 03:40:14.520 align:start position:0%
Safety is responsible for developing
 
03:40:16.910 --> 03:40:16.920 align:start position:0%
implementing effective strategies to
 
03:40:18.550 --> 03:40:18.560 align:start position:0%
reduce the state's traffic related
 
03:40:21.030 --> 03:40:21.040 align:start position:0%
injuries and fatality rates these
 
03:40:22.469 --> 03:40:22.479 align:start position:0%
strategies may take the form of
 
03:40:25.389 --> 03:40:25.399 align:start position:0%
Standalone projects activities Andor
 
03:40:28.030 --> 03:40:28.040 align:start position:0%
comprehensive long-term programs both
 
03:40:30.070 --> 03:40:30.080 align:start position:0%
traditional and Innovative strategies
 
03:40:32.150 --> 03:40:32.160 align:start position:0%
are encouraged and utilized to support
 
03:40:34.469 --> 03:40:34.479 align:start position:0%
the office of Highway Safety goals they
 
03:40:37.670 --> 03:40:37.680 align:start position:0%
do um they do this as a pass through
 
03:40:40.189 --> 03:40:40.199 align:start position:0%
entity for program funding received from
 
03:40:42.550 --> 03:40:42.560 align:start position:0%
the national highway traffic safety
 
03:40:46.189 --> 03:40:46.199 align:start position:0%
administration also known as Nitsa
 
03:40:49.469 --> 03:40:49.479 align:start position:0%
um for things that include uh speed
 
03:40:52.670 --> 03:40:52.680 align:start position:0%
enforcement and Equipment amongst other
 
03:40:54.510 --> 03:40:54.520 align:start position:0%
uh things like impaired driving
 
03:40:56.389 --> 03:40:56.399 align:start position:0%
enforcement and Equipment distracted
 
03:40:58.870 --> 03:40:58.880 align:start position:0%
driving enforcement occupant protection
 
03:41:00.469 --> 03:41:00.479 align:start position:0%
enforcement pedestrian bicycle
 
03:41:02.309 --> 03:41:02.319 align:start position:0%
enforcement as well as media and
 
03:41:04.550 --> 03:41:04.560 align:start position:0%
messaging and education Outreach
 
03:41:07.389 --> 03:41:07.399 align:start position:0%
programs so the office of Highway Safety
 
03:41:09.990 --> 03:41:10.000 align:start position:0%
is responsible for administration of the
 
03:41:11.870 --> 03:41:11.880 align:start position:0%
Federal Highway Safety funds and for
 
03:41:13.950 --> 03:41:13.960 align:start position:0%
facilitating the highway safety programs
 
03:41:16.389 --> 03:41:16.399 align:start position:0%
supported by these funds
 
03:41:19.510 --> 03:41:19.520 align:start position:0%
uh their funding is in the form of um
 
03:41:22.710 --> 03:41:22.720 align:start position:0%
reimbursement to the subrecipient under
 
03:41:27.469 --> 03:41:27.479 align:start position:0%
Grant uh agreements indor um
 
03:41:30.030 --> 03:41:30.040 align:start position:0%
contacts the only item in this bill that
 
03:41:34.110 --> 03:41:34.120 align:start position:0%
Nitsa doesn't fund um would be the use
 
03:41:36.670 --> 03:41:36.680 align:start position:0%
of the automated speed cameras except in
 
03:41:39.630 --> 03:41:39.640 align:start position:0%
school and work Zone um that's the only
 
03:41:40.990 --> 03:41:41.000 align:start position:0%
place that
 
03:41:45.229 --> 03:41:45.239 align:start position:0%
Nitsa um would allow for those funds to
 
03:41:46.469 --> 03:41:46.479 align:start position:0%
to be
 
03:41:46.479 --> 03:41:48.550 align:start position:0%
to be
utilized

03:41:48.550 --> 03:41:48.560 align:start position:0%
utilized
 
03:41:52.910 --> 03:41:52.920 align:start position:0%
um I can say that the the local agencies
 
03:41:55.349 --> 03:41:55.359 align:start position:0%
in the state police are not utilizing
 
03:41:57.389 --> 03:41:57.399 align:start position:0%
all of the funds that have been
 
03:42:02.070 --> 03:42:02.080 align:start position:0%
allocated um mostly due to to Staffing
 
03:42:04.269 --> 03:42:04.279 align:start position:0%
um I think that when New Hampshire law
 
03:42:07.149 --> 03:42:07.159 align:start position:0%
enforcement agencies are better staffed
 
03:42:09.790 --> 03:42:09.800 align:start position:0%
it would be beneficial to have um
 
03:42:12.229 --> 03:42:12.239 align:start position:0%
additional State funding available uh
 
03:42:14.550 --> 03:42:14.560 align:start position:0%
through Innovative strategies such as
 
03:42:18.750 --> 03:42:18.760 align:start position:0%
this in this bill so with that there's
 
03:42:18.760 --> 03:42:20.070 align:start position:0%
this in this bill so with that there's
any

03:42:20.070 --> 03:42:20.080 align:start position:0%
any
 
03:42:22.670 --> 03:42:22.680 align:start position:0%
questions just uh if I could recap so
 
03:42:25.630 --> 03:42:25.640 align:start position:0%
the Nitsa kind of does this already on a
 
03:42:29.550 --> 03:42:29.560 align:start position:0%
separate track um but when the
 
03:42:33.070 --> 03:42:33.080 align:start position:0%
Departments get um proper Staffing and
 
03:42:35.349 --> 03:42:35.359 align:start position:0%
operating on all cylinders there's
 
03:42:37.389 --> 03:42:37.399 align:start position:0%
definitely room for additional funding
 
03:42:39.950 --> 03:42:39.960 align:start position:0%
that this would is that pretty much what
 
03:42:42.670 --> 03:42:42.680 align:start position:0%
you said yes sir so essentially what's
 
03:42:45.550 --> 03:42:45.560 align:start position:0%
proposed um is what Nitsa does on the
 
03:42:47.870 --> 03:42:47.880 align:start position:0%
federal level with federal grants that
 
03:42:49.229 --> 03:42:49.239 align:start position:0%
are distributed through the office of
 
03:42:51.910 --> 03:42:51.920 align:start position:0%
Highway Safety to both state and local
 
03:42:56.269 --> 03:42:56.279 align:start position:0%
agencies um at this time okay um is it
 
03:42:57.790 --> 03:42:57.800 align:start position:0%
possible that there there isn't enough
 
03:42:59.630 --> 03:42:59.640 align:start position:0%
funding available there I'm I'm trying
 
03:43:01.990 --> 03:43:02.000 align:start position:0%
to figure out why why what brought the
 
03:43:03.469 --> 03:43:03.479 align:start position:0%
need for this bill if there was already
 
03:43:05.070 --> 03:43:05.080 align:start position:0%
this funding
 
03:43:07.590 --> 03:43:07.600 align:start position:0%
there that I'm not sure um I can tell
 
03:43:09.870 --> 03:43:09.880 align:start position:0%
you that there's plenty of funds
 
03:43:12.469 --> 03:43:12.479 align:start position:0%
available um over the last three years I
 
03:43:15.149 --> 03:43:15.159 align:start position:0%
have data over the last three years um
 
03:43:17.910 --> 03:43:17.920 align:start position:0%
we haven't exceeded um close to the
 
03:43:20.870 --> 03:43:20.880 align:start position:0%
funding that is available so whether uh
 
03:43:23.469 --> 03:43:23.479 align:start position:0%
an application was applied for um by the
 
03:43:26.189 --> 03:43:26.199 align:start position:0%
agency that's requesting this or or
 
03:43:28.590 --> 03:43:28.600 align:start position:0%
seems that this is a problem uh I would
 
03:43:30.269 --> 03:43:30.279 align:start position:0%
encourage them to reach out to the
 
03:43:32.149 --> 03:43:32.159 align:start position:0%
office of Highway Safety to see what
 
03:43:34.550 --> 03:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
what funds are available um does the
 
03:43:36.750 --> 03:43:36.760 align:start position:0%
office of Highway Safety um operate
 
03:43:38.349 --> 03:43:38.359 align:start position:0%
proactively reaching out letting
 
03:43:39.750 --> 03:43:39.760 align:start position:0%
departments know there's money available
 
03:43:41.790 --> 03:43:41.800 align:start position:0%
and things like that that I don't know
 
03:43:44.710 --> 03:43:44.720 align:start position:0%
okay all right thank you see you no
 
03:43:46.349 --> 03:43:46.359 align:start position:0%

03:43:52.229 --> 03:43:52.239 align:start position:0%
so seeing none I hear
 
03:44:01.110 --> 03:44:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:11.910 --> 03:44:11.920 align:start position:0%

afternoon ladies and gentlemen of the
 
03:44:21.429 --> 03:44:21.439 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Bill mcfaden I am
 
03:44:23.070 --> 03:44:23.080 align:start position:0%
the chair of the select Board of New
 
03:44:25.030 --> 03:44:25.040 align:start position:0%
Boston and I've reached out to my
 
03:44:27.429 --> 03:44:27.439 align:start position:0%
representative to introduce this bill
 
03:44:29.189 --> 03:44:29.199 align:start position:0%
this started with a general discussion
 
03:44:31.070 --> 03:44:31.080 align:start position:0%
with one of the officers on duty while
 
03:44:34.110 --> 03:44:34.120 align:start position:0%
we were having our voting last November
 
03:44:35.550 --> 03:44:35.560 align:start position:0%
uh we just started to talk about
 
03:44:37.670 --> 03:44:37.680 align:start position:0%
speeding we have a we have a large
 
03:44:39.710 --> 03:44:39.720 align:start position:0%
speeding problem in the town of New
 
03:44:42.070 --> 03:44:42.080 align:start position:0%
Boston I travel I commute from New
 
03:44:44.269 --> 03:44:44.279 align:start position:0%
Boston to Hudson daily and I see it in
 
03:44:46.990 --> 03:44:47.000 align:start position:0%
every municip spity I driveth through uh
 
03:44:49.269 --> 03:44:49.279 align:start position:0%
people are just they're crazy out there
 
03:44:51.070 --> 03:44:51.080 align:start position:0%
so it was just a general discussion and
 
03:44:53.189 --> 03:44:53.199 align:start position:0%
I started to talk talk with the officer
 
03:44:56.469 --> 03:44:56.479 align:start position:0%
about that and he said he has the tools
 
03:44:58.790 --> 03:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
we have radar but we don't have lidar
 
03:45:01.429 --> 03:45:01.439 align:start position:0%
which is laser uh and he's like it's
 
03:45:03.790 --> 03:45:03.800 align:start position:0%
just it's too costly I'm like okay so
 
03:45:06.349 --> 03:45:06.359 align:start position:0%
what can we do and I'm speaking not just
 
03:45:08.030 --> 03:45:08.040 align:start position:0%
on behalf of New Boston but other
 
03:45:10.429 --> 03:45:10.439 align:start position:0%
smaller municipalities where budgets are
 
03:45:13.349 --> 03:45:13.359 align:start position:0%
tight um you know we don't have a large
 
03:45:15.269 --> 03:45:15.279 align:start position:0%
commercial base in town so it's it's
 
03:45:16.790 --> 03:45:16.800 align:start position:0%
residents that are that are footing the
 
03:45:19.750 --> 03:45:19.760 align:start position:0%
bill and whenever uh police departments
 
03:45:23.189 --> 03:45:23.199 align:start position:0%
try to add add uh items to their budget
 
03:45:25.710 --> 03:45:25.720 align:start position:0%
everybody has you know they they get all
 
03:45:27.990 --> 03:45:28.000 align:start position:0%
worked up so I started to think about
 
03:45:31.229 --> 03:45:31.239 align:start position:0%
what about a a possible grant program uh
 
03:45:33.149 --> 03:45:33.159 align:start position:0%
where some of the monies from uh traffic
 
03:45:35.710 --> 03:45:35.720 align:start position:0%
tickets can go into a grant and
 
03:45:39.349 --> 03:45:39.359 align:start position:0%
municipalities can go to this pool and
 
03:45:42.670 --> 03:45:42.680 align:start position:0%
apply for apply for monies for equipment
 
03:45:45.349 --> 03:45:45.359 align:start position:0%
um I spoke with my chief my chief of
 
03:45:46.990 --> 03:45:47.000 align:start position:0%
police in town he thought it was a great
 
03:45:50.389 --> 03:45:50.399 align:start position:0%
idea we're not we're not a poor town but
 
03:45:52.750 --> 03:45:52.760 align:start position:0%
we're not certainly not a um we have no
 
03:45:55.149 --> 03:45:55.159 align:start position:0%
commercial base in town so again it goes
 
03:45:57.469 --> 03:45:57.479 align:start position:0%
back to the the funding of this so we
 
03:45:59.030 --> 03:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
started to talk about what could it be
 
03:46:02.550 --> 03:46:02.560 align:start position:0%
used for light our guns uh digital speed
 
03:46:04.750 --> 03:46:04.760 align:start position:0%
control devices because I can tell you
 
03:46:07.149 --> 03:46:07.159 align:start position:0%
as as a driver when I see those speed
 
03:46:09.229 --> 03:46:09.239 align:start position:0%
controls it always makes my eyes go
 
03:46:10.990 --> 03:46:11.000 align:start position:0%
right down to my speedometer and if I
 
03:46:13.349 --> 03:46:13.359 align:start position:0%
see them just a few miles over it I will
 
03:46:18.630 --> 03:46:18.640 align:start position:0%
slow down those those devices do work um
 
03:46:19.950 --> 03:46:19.960 align:start position:0%
and by that you're talking about those
 
03:46:22.070 --> 03:46:22.080 align:start position:0%
portable signs the portable or or
 
03:46:24.349 --> 03:46:24.359 align:start position:0%
trailer the trailer ones as well uh and
 
03:46:25.830 --> 03:46:25.840 align:start position:0%
just it's simple things like that I
 
03:46:27.910 --> 03:46:27.920 align:start position:0%
think that could help uh around the
 
03:46:30.349 --> 03:46:30.359 align:start position:0%
state um to try to get traffic to slow
 
03:46:32.910 --> 03:46:32.920 align:start position:0%
down because it is just it really is out
 
03:46:34.990 --> 03:46:35.000 align:start position:0%
of control right now and I'm just trying
 
03:46:37.590 --> 03:46:37.600 align:start position:0%
to do my part to see what we can do to
 
03:46:39.229 --> 03:46:39.239 align:start position:0%
try to curtail
 
03:46:42.510 --> 03:46:42.520 align:start position:0%
this and we appreciate it thank you um
 
03:46:43.830 --> 03:46:43.840 align:start position:0%
you heard the earlier testimony
 
03:46:46.550 --> 03:46:46.560 align:start position:0%
regarding Nitsa the National Highway uh
 
03:46:49.429 --> 03:46:49.439 align:start position:0%
safety have you or your town applied for
 
03:46:51.389 --> 03:46:51.399 align:start position:0%
any grants to them that I do not know
 
03:46:53.030 --> 03:46:53.040 align:start position:0%
but I made a note and I am certainly
 
03:46:55.309 --> 03:46:55.319 align:start position:0%
going to investigate that okay if you if
 
03:46:56.910 --> 03:46:56.920 align:start position:0%
you could when you talk to your Chief
 
03:46:58.830 --> 03:46:58.840 align:start position:0%
and you get feedback on that could you
 
03:47:00.469 --> 03:47:00.479 align:start position:0%
ask him to pass it on or you pass it on
 
03:47:01.790 --> 03:47:01.800 align:start position:0%
to your representative so we could get
 
03:47:04.030 --> 03:47:04.040 align:start position:0%
it back here absolutely do I appreciate
 
03:47:05.990 --> 03:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
it any questions from the
 
03:47:08.229 --> 03:47:08.239 align:start position:0%
committee I I would assume that a lot of
 
03:47:09.710 --> 03:47:09.720 align:start position:0%
your speeding problems are caused by
 
03:47:11.990 --> 03:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
those those um strange space force
 
03:47:13.630 --> 03:47:13.640 align:start position:0%
people that are stationed in New Boston
 
03:47:16.110 --> 03:47:16.120 align:start position:0%
I think have you seen a lot of so so
 
03:47:18.229 --> 03:47:18.239 align:start position:0%
some of there and a lot of the uh skiers
 
03:47:20.550 --> 03:47:20.560 align:start position:0%
that go to um you know this we have Pats
 
03:47:22.630 --> 03:47:22.640 align:start position:0%
Peak right nearby and we have over in
 
03:47:24.149 --> 03:47:24.159 align:start position:0%
Frances town we have the scary too we
 
03:47:27.030 --> 03:47:27.040 align:start position:0%
see a lot of out of state plates okay
 
03:47:29.590 --> 03:47:29.600 align:start position:0%
that that's just are do you do you
 
03:47:31.110 --> 03:47:31.120 align:start position:0%
provide it or does your Police
 
03:47:33.269 --> 03:47:33.279 align:start position:0%
Department provide any security or work
 
03:47:35.229 --> 03:47:35.239 align:start position:0%
in tandem with the base security yes we
 
03:47:37.229 --> 03:47:37.239 align:start position:0%
do and do you receive any funding back
 
03:47:38.630 --> 03:47:38.640 align:start position:0%
from the feds to that we do we actually
 
03:47:41.429 --> 03:47:41.439 align:start position:0%
just had a k9 program established um and
 
03:47:42.750 --> 03:47:42.760 align:start position:0%
they're funding that they're funding
 
03:47:44.110 --> 03:47:44.120 align:start position:0%

04:32:37.710 --> 04:32:37.720 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you Mr chairman um Mr
 
04:32:39.070 --> 04:32:39.080 align:start position:0%
chairman for the my name is
 
04:32:40.750 --> 04:32:40.760 align:start position:0%
representative rosbury I represent the
 
04:32:42.630 --> 04:32:42.640 align:start position:0%
towns of
 
04:32:46.070 --> 04:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
uh gtown and wear in Hillsboro 39 I'm
 
04:32:47.389 --> 04:32:47.399 align:start position:0%
here for the purpose of introduction for
 
04:32:49.030 --> 04:32:49.040 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
04:32:52.630 --> 04:32:52.640 align:start position:0%
592 which is about uh magistrates and
 
04:32:55.670 --> 04:32:55.680 align:start position:0%
bail reform um I don't need to elaborate
 
04:32:58.469 --> 04:32:58.479 align:start position:0%
to this body The Saga that has been bail
 
04:33:01.790 --> 04:33:01.800 align:start position:0%
reform um but I do think we may be
 
04:33:03.750 --> 04:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
finally approaching hopefully the Final
 
04:33:07.750 --> 04:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
Chapter so as as we know PR bail has
 
04:33:11.109 --> 04:33:11.119 align:start position:0%
been basically an adamant failure um we
 
04:33:13.230 --> 04:33:13.240 align:start position:0%
just had an incident where an officer
 
04:33:16.109 --> 04:33:16.119 align:start position:0%
was shot uh in an altercation with
 
04:33:19.349 --> 04:33:19.359 align:start position:0%
somebody who should have been in jail um
 
04:33:21.390 --> 04:33:21.400 align:start position:0%
one of my former constituents as you
 
04:33:23.670 --> 04:33:23.680 align:start position:0%
know was stabbed to death by a person
 
04:33:26.990 --> 04:33:27.000 align:start position:0%
who was out on double cashless bail um
 
04:33:28.910 --> 04:33:28.920 align:start position:0%
and the the stories have become Stranger
 
04:33:31.869 --> 04:33:31.879 align:start position:0%
Than Fiction but I do think with the
 
04:33:35.390 --> 04:33:35.400 align:start position:0%
changes in conquered um in the in the
 
04:33:38.310 --> 04:33:38.320 align:start position:0%
halls of legislature um that we do
 
04:33:40.150 --> 04:33:40.160 align:start position:0%
finally have something that will put an
 
04:33:43.070 --> 04:33:43.080 align:start position:0%
end to this so so I have distributed to
 
04:33:45.750 --> 04:33:45.760 align:start position:0%
the committee an amendment that I worked
 
04:33:48.789 --> 04:33:48.799 align:start position:0%
with the governor aot's office on um and
 
04:33:59.070 --> 04:33:59.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:59.080 --> 04:34:03.990 align:start position:0%
 
2025-the

04:34:03.990 --> 04:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:06.189 --> 04:34:06.199 align:start position:0%
um because I felt that the statement
 
04:34:08.029 --> 04:34:08.039 align:start position:0%
needed to be made that the system
 
04:34:10.070 --> 04:34:10.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't work but I also live in the
 
04:34:11.750 --> 04:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
reality that we may never see full
 
04:34:14.310 --> 04:34:14.320 align:start position:0%
appeal so what this bill does in a
 
04:34:15.949 --> 04:34:15.959 align:start position:0%
nutshell and I'll let people behind me
 
04:34:17.709 --> 04:34:17.719 align:start position:0%
who are well more versed than it and can
 
04:34:19.070 --> 04:34:19.080 align:start position:0%
answer your questions answer those
 
04:34:20.429 --> 04:34:20.439 align:start position:0%
questions but what what it does as
 
04:34:23.029 --> 04:34:23.039 align:start position:0%
nutshell is it takes what was working
 
04:34:24.990 --> 04:34:25.000 align:start position:0%
the small parts of PR bail that were
 
04:34:28.269 --> 04:34:28.279 align:start position:0%
working um and it keeps it in place um
 
04:34:32.189 --> 04:34:32.199 align:start position:0%
but it gets rid of kind of the extreme
 
04:34:36.029 --> 04:34:36.039 align:start position:0%
examples of just letting people go it it
 
04:34:38.551 --> 04:34:38.561 align:start position:0%
ends the revolving dorm so it has things
 
04:34:40.029 --> 04:34:40.039 align:start position:0%
in there like you're not going to get PR
 
04:34:41.830 --> 04:34:41.840 align:start position:0%
Bal if you're arrested while already out
 
04:34:43.750 --> 04:34:43.760 align:start position:0%
on bail if you violate a bond condition
 
04:34:47.470 --> 04:34:47.480 align:start position:0%
those sort of things it takes it from
 
04:34:51.310 --> 04:34:51.320 align:start position:0%
the basically automatic default to a you
 
04:34:54.629 --> 04:34:54.639 align:start position:0%
need to prove that you qualify for it so
 
04:34:55.789 --> 04:34:55.799 align:start position:0%
I know that this is going to be a long
 
04:34:57.990 --> 04:34:58.000 align:start position:0%
hearing there's many members of the law
 
04:34:59.590 --> 04:34:59.600 align:start position:0%
enforcement he Community hopefully in
 
04:35:01.789 --> 04:35:01.799 align:start position:0%
support of this um and I'm going to let
 
04:35:04.109 --> 04:35:04.119 align:start position:0%
the governor's office if the chair will
 
04:35:05.910 --> 04:35:05.920 align:start position:0%
indulge me let the governor's office and
 
04:35:07.869 --> 04:35:07.879 align:start position:0%
their representative come up and explain
 
04:35:10.230 --> 04:35:10.240 align:start position:0%
what's in the contents of this amendment
 
04:35:18.709 --> 04:35:18.719 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:21.551 --> 04:35:21.561 align:start position:0%
spill the chair calls miles mat from the
 
04:35:21.561 --> 04:35:28.029 align:start position:0%
spill the chair calls miles mat from the
governor's

04:35:41.510 --> 04:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
protection and the Department of Justice
 
04:35:43.990 --> 04:35:44.000 align:start position:0%
uh up to testify with me if that's
 
04:35:45.910 --> 04:35:45.920 align:start position:0%
amendable to the that would be fine as
 
04:35:47.470 --> 04:35:47.480 align:start position:0%
long as you both filled out a pin card
 
04:35:56.629 --> 04:35:56.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:59.070 --> 04:35:59.080 align:start position:0%
please members of the committee the
 
04:36:01.629 --> 04:36:01.639 align:start position:0%
amendment that you have before you uh is
 
04:36:03.390 --> 04:36:03.400 align:start position:0%
designed to protect our communities
 
04:36:06.269 --> 04:36:06.279 align:start position:0%
protect law enforcement and it is
 
04:36:08.709 --> 04:36:08.719 align:start position:0%
incorporating Lessons Learned uh in the
 
04:36:11.830 --> 04:36:11.840 align:start position:0%
bail reform efforts of the past seven in
 
04:36:14.510 --> 04:36:14.520 align:start position:0%
eight years and as representative Barry
 
04:36:15.990 --> 04:36:16.000 align:start position:0%
indicated it's designed to stop a
 
04:36:18.470 --> 04:36:18.480 align:start position:0%
revolving door whereby U repeat
 
04:36:22.070 --> 04:36:22.080 align:start position:0%
offenders are exposed to the community
 
04:36:24.869 --> 04:36:24.879 align:start position:0%
uh and committing crimes uh again and
 
04:36:28.750 --> 04:36:28.760 align:start position:0%
it's tailored to that uh to that
 
04:36:31.070 --> 04:36:31.080 align:start position:0%
population the governor supports this
 
04:36:33.029 --> 04:36:33.039 align:start position:0%
this amendment it should be no surprise
 
04:36:35.269 --> 04:36:35.279 align:start position:0%
to you that the the governor uh spoke to
 
04:36:37.629 --> 04:36:37.639 align:start position:0%
a number of people about bail reform on
 
04:36:40.230 --> 04:36:40.240 align:start position:0%
the campaign Trail uh that she heard
 
04:36:43.310 --> 04:36:43.320 align:start position:0%
from many citizens across our state that
 
04:36:45.310 --> 04:36:45.320 align:start position:0%
she has heard from law enforcement with
 
04:36:47.230 --> 04:36:47.240 align:start position:0%
her background has um an intimate
 
04:36:49.230 --> 04:36:49.240 align:start position:0%
knowledge of this subject area and that
 
04:36:51.789 --> 04:36:51.799 align:start position:0%
this is an important issue uh to her to
 
04:36:54.070 --> 04:36:54.080 align:start position:0%
address and is supportive of this
 
04:36:58.429 --> 04:36:58.439 align:start position:0%
amendment and this effort uh to revise
 
04:37:00.551 --> 04:37:00.561 align:start position:0%
current law with the lessons that have
 
04:37:03.230 --> 04:37:03.240 align:start position:0%
been learned um in our past number of
 
04:37:06.910 --> 04:37:06.920 align:start position:0%
years uh the the primary focus is to
 
04:37:10.029 --> 04:37:10.039 align:start position:0%
ensure protection U for our communities
 
04:37:12.629 --> 04:37:12.639 align:start position:0%
for victims uh uh and for our Law
 
04:37:14.349 --> 04:37:14.359 align:start position:0%
Enforcement Officers by taking a common
 
04:37:17.789 --> 04:37:17.799 align:start position:0%
sense approach that focuses on repeat
 
04:37:21.709 --> 04:37:21.719 align:start position:0%
offenders by those who have previously
 
04:37:23.590 --> 04:37:23.600 align:start position:0%
committed offenses while on bail who
 
04:37:25.629 --> 04:37:25.639 align:start position:0%
have violated bail conditions or have
 
04:37:28.349 --> 04:37:28.359 align:start position:0%
failed to appear for their Court
 
04:37:30.310 --> 04:37:30.320 align:start position:0%
appearances so some of the lessons
 
04:37:33.551 --> 04:37:33.561 align:start position:0%
learned from um our our past efforts at
 
04:37:36.310 --> 04:37:36.320 align:start position:0%
at bail reform is that current law is
 
04:37:38.789 --> 04:37:38.799 align:start position:0%
not adequately protecting our
 
04:37:41.990 --> 04:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
communities or law enforcement for that
 
04:37:43.830 --> 04:37:43.840 align:start position:0%
subset of individuals who repeatedly
 
04:37:45.230 --> 04:37:45.240 align:start position:0%
flout the
 
04:37:48.429 --> 04:37:48.439 align:start position:0%
law uh you may be familiar with the
 
04:37:50.869 --> 04:37:50.879 align:start position:0%
governor's right along uh with a police
 
04:37:52.670 --> 04:37:52.680 align:start position:0%
officer who had his finger noded to the
 
04:37:55.150 --> 04:37:55.160 align:start position:0%
Bone by an individual who uh was
 
04:37:58.990 --> 04:37:59.000 align:start position:0%
dangerous to others dangerous to the
 
04:38:00.830 --> 04:38:00.840 align:start position:0%
community as was just mentioned there
 
04:38:02.390 --> 04:38:02.400 align:start position:0%
was a Bedford officer who was shot
 
04:38:04.230 --> 04:38:04.240 align:start position:0%
during a skirmish with an individual who
 
04:38:06.109 --> 04:38:06.119 align:start position:0%
had numerous failures to appear
 
04:38:08.070 --> 04:38:08.080 align:start position:0%
including on a charge of possession of a
 
04:38:08.080 --> 04:38:09.150 align:start position:0%
including on a charge of possession of a
dangerous

04:38:09.150 --> 04:38:09.160 align:start position:0%
dangerous
 
04:38:13.390 --> 04:38:13.400 align:start position:0%
weapon uh and under the features of our
 
04:38:16.629 --> 04:38:16.639 align:start position:0%
current system technically he was uh not
 
04:38:19.910 --> 04:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
detained because he hadn't um hit the
 
04:38:22.150 --> 04:38:22.160 align:start position:0%
required number of failures to appear in
 
04:38:25.029 --> 04:38:25.039 align:start position:0%
the short enough time frame uh so he was
 
04:38:28.510 --> 04:38:28.520 align:start position:0%
out and he seriously injured a police
 
04:38:33.150 --> 04:38:33.160 align:start position:0%
officer the current uh law that has a a
 
04:38:35.629 --> 04:38:35.639 align:start position:0%
three strikes rule for failures to
 
04:38:37.830 --> 04:38:37.840 align:start position:0%
appear is a permission slip to continue
 
04:38:40.629 --> 04:38:40.639 align:start position:0%
to ignore court orders and obligations
 
04:38:44.429 --> 04:38:44.439 align:start position:0%
to be responsive and to appear uh in our
 
04:38:47.590 --> 04:38:47.600 align:start position:0%
justice system and current law prohibits
 
04:38:49.109 --> 04:38:49.119 align:start position:0%
judges from ordering detention where
 
04:38:50.869 --> 04:38:50.879 align:start position:0%
there's probable cause to believe that a
 
04:38:53.709 --> 04:38:53.719 align:start position:0%
person will be dangerous to themselves
 
04:38:56.629 --> 04:38:56.639 align:start position:0%
to others or to the community so the
 
04:38:58.510 --> 04:38:58.520 align:start position:0%
amendment before the committee takes a
 
04:39:00.869 --> 04:39:00.879 align:start position:0%
common sense approach of trying to close
 
04:39:04.349 --> 04:39:04.359 align:start position:0%
those loopholes to appropriately craft
 
04:39:07.269 --> 04:39:07.279 align:start position:0%
the standard the threshold the mechanism
 
04:39:10.349 --> 04:39:10.359 align:start position:0%
such that a judge can protect the
 
04:39:12.070 --> 04:39:12.080 align:start position:0%
community protect Law Enforcement
 
04:39:14.109 --> 04:39:14.119 align:start position:0%
Officers protect individuals who pose a
 
04:39:16.390 --> 04:39:16.400 align:start position:0%
danger to themselves or who have a
 
04:39:17.990 --> 04:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
demonstrated history of failing to
 
04:39:20.750 --> 04:39:20.760 align:start position:0%
comply with conditions imposed upon them
 
04:39:22.310 --> 04:39:22.320 align:start position:0%
and that's really to stop the re
 
04:39:23.990 --> 04:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
revolving door that we've heard about
 
04:39:25.269 --> 04:39:25.279 align:start position:0%
and that we
 
04:39:27.869 --> 04:39:27.879 align:start position:0%
see uh current law sometimes allows an
 
04:39:29.230 --> 04:39:29.240 align:start position:0%
offender even where there is probable
 
04:39:31.269 --> 04:39:31.279 align:start position:0%
cause to believe that they pose a danger
 
04:39:33.070 --> 04:39:33.080 align:start position:0%
to themselves another or to the
 
04:39:35.189 --> 04:39:35.199 align:start position:0%
community or has a history of violating
 
04:39:37.830 --> 04:39:37.840 align:start position:0%
bail conditions either by ignoring bail
 
04:39:39.150 --> 04:39:39.160 align:start position:0%
conditions failing to appear or
 
04:39:41.070 --> 04:39:41.080 align:start position:0%
committing new offenses back on the
 
04:39:41.080 --> 04:39:42.670 align:start position:0%
committing new offenses back on the
street

04:39:42.670 --> 04:39:42.680 align:start position:0%
street
 
04:39:45.070 --> 04:39:45.080 align:start position:0%
and uh you may hear from our Law
 
04:39:46.590 --> 04:39:46.600 align:start position:0%
Enforcement Officers where they may have
 
04:39:48.430 --> 04:39:48.440 align:start position:0%
an individual such as that and that
 
04:39:49.910 --> 04:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
individual may be released back to the
 
04:39:51.550 --> 04:39:51.560 align:start position:0%
street before the police have even been
 
04:39:54.230 --> 04:39:54.240 align:start position:0%
able to finish and file their police
 
04:39:56.390 --> 04:39:56.400 align:start position:0%
reports that's not a system that's
 
04:39:58.510 --> 04:39:58.520 align:start position:0%
working that's a system that should be
 
04:40:00.470 --> 04:40:00.480 align:start position:0%
addressed in order to prohibit that
 
04:40:02.948 --> 04:40:02.958 align:start position:0%
outcome this amendment judges have the
 
04:40:05.788 --> 04:40:05.798 align:start position:0%
discretion to be able to look in those
 
04:40:09.830 --> 04:40:09.840 align:start position:0%
circumstances and keep those individuals
 
04:40:12.110 --> 04:40:12.120 align:start position:0%
detained they have judges have
 
04:40:14.470 --> 04:40:14.480 align:start position:0%
discretion one of the lessons learned to
 
04:40:16.990 --> 04:40:17.000 align:start position:0%
be able to look at the financial
 
04:40:18.990 --> 04:40:19.000 align:start position:0%
conditions of an individual and to take
 
04:40:21.350 --> 04:40:21.360 align:start position:0%
those account such that the financial
 
04:40:23.350 --> 04:40:23.360 align:start position:0%
conditions alone are not going to have
 
04:40:23.360 --> 04:40:25.510 align:start position:0%
conditions alone are not going to have
someone

04:40:25.510 --> 04:40:25.520 align:start position:0%
someone
 
04:40:27.550 --> 04:40:27.560 align:start position:0%
detained but where there is evidence
 
04:40:30.030 --> 04:40:30.040 align:start position:0%
indicating that there is a danger or
 
04:40:32.550 --> 04:40:32.560 align:start position:0%
history of of non-compliance Judges will
 
04:40:35.190 --> 04:40:35.200 align:start position:0%
have that authority to detain those
 
04:40:37.150 --> 04:40:37.160 align:start position:0%
individuals so listen to our law
 
04:40:38.990 --> 04:40:39.000 align:start position:0%
enforcement listen to our
 
04:40:41.910 --> 04:40:41.920 align:start position:0%
communities listen to
 
04:40:44.750 --> 04:40:44.760 align:start position:0%
those experiences and the empirical
 
04:40:46.430 --> 04:40:46.440 align:start position:0%
evidence that suggest that we need to be
 
04:40:49.910 --> 04:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
tailoring our approach to this subset of
 
04:40:52.310 --> 04:40:52.320 align:start position:0%
of individuals this is a common sense
 
04:40:54.230 --> 04:40:54.240 align:start position:0%
bail reform that will improve our system
 
04:40:55.750 --> 04:40:55.760 align:start position:0%
protect our communities protect our law
 
04:40:58.590 --> 04:40:58.600 align:start position:0%
enforcement and it's not just anecdotal
 
04:41:01.230 --> 04:41:01.240 align:start position:0%
there is empirical evidence that focuses
 
04:41:03.910 --> 04:41:03.920 align:start position:0%
and directs us to establishing a
 
04:41:06.910 --> 04:41:06.920 align:start position:0%
mechanism to focusing on this set of
 
04:41:09.550 --> 04:41:09.560 align:start position:0%
individuals um who are high use or
 
04:41:12.230 --> 04:41:12.240 align:start position:0%
repeat offenders so with that and to
 
04:41:13.670 --> 04:41:13.680 align:start position:0%
speak to that point would like to hand
 
04:41:16.390 --> 04:41:16.400 align:start position:0%
off to uh Tom valard the director of the
 
04:41:17.470 --> 04:41:17.480 align:start position:0%
division of public protection in the
 
04:41:19.070 --> 04:41:19.080 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice thank you Attorney
 
04:41:21.030 --> 04:41:21.040 align:start position:0%
Madison thank you ladies and gentlemen
 
04:41:22.350 --> 04:41:22.360 align:start position:0%
it's a pleasure to be here it's been a
 
04:41:24.830 --> 04:41:24.840 align:start position:0%
long seven years I have been part of
 
04:41:27.190 --> 04:41:27.200 align:start position:0%
bail reform discussion since their
 
04:41:30.708 --> 04:41:30.718 align:start position:0%
Inception in 2018 um and I think it's
 
04:41:32.310 --> 04:41:32.320 align:start position:0%
important for me to
 
04:41:34.830 --> 04:41:34.840 align:start position:0%
recognize the real work and effort that
 
04:41:37.708 --> 04:41:37.718 align:start position:0%
many of you in this room have put into
 
04:41:39.990 --> 04:41:40.000 align:start position:0%
improving the situation both for people
 
04:41:42.628 --> 04:41:42.638 align:start position:0%
accused of crimes as well as for our
 
04:41:45.470 --> 04:41:45.480 align:start position:0%
communities I want to emphasize uh
 
04:41:46.948 --> 04:41:46.958 align:start position:0%
however that there is another step that
 
04:41:48.550 --> 04:41:48.560 align:start position:0%
can be taken and I believe that this
 
04:41:51.310 --> 04:41:51.320 align:start position:0%
Governor's Bill addresses that
 
04:41:53.628 --> 04:41:53.638 align:start position:0%
specifically it has to do um as been
 
04:41:56.270 --> 04:41:56.280 align:start position:0%
said by the rep uh representative who's
 
04:41:57.990 --> 04:41:58.000 align:start position:0%
sponsoring this amendment as well as
 
04:42:00.990 --> 04:42:01.000 align:start position:0%
Attorney Madison that term we keep using
 
04:42:02.830 --> 04:42:02.840 align:start position:0%
revolving door I don't particularly like
 
04:42:04.830 --> 04:42:04.840 align:start position:0%
it we are talking about human beings who
 
04:42:06.430 --> 04:42:06.440 align:start position:0%
may be having struggles but the fact of
 
04:42:08.150 --> 04:42:08.160 align:start position:0%
the matter is they are coming in and out
 
04:42:10.470 --> 04:42:10.480 align:start position:0%
of the criminal justice system with
 
04:42:12.390 --> 04:42:12.400 align:start position:0%
great rapidity
 
04:42:15.590 --> 04:42:15.600 align:start position:0%
in fact uh our
 
04:42:19.750 --> 04:42:19.760 align:start position:0%
state sanctioned the uh Center uh
 
04:42:21.150 --> 04:42:21.160 align:start position:0%
Justice Center Council of state
 
04:42:23.430 --> 04:42:23.440 align:start position:0%
governments to look at that very issue
 
04:42:26.230 --> 04:42:26.240 align:start position:0%
and for a number of years they have one
 
04:42:29.070 --> 04:42:29.080 align:start position:0%
of the findings that they made uh in
 
04:42:30.670 --> 04:42:30.680 align:start position:0%
this report which I'm happy to leave
 
04:42:34.350 --> 04:42:34.360 align:start position:0%
with the with the committee is that this
 
04:42:36.750 --> 04:42:36.760 align:start position:0%
the stories that you've heard not just
 
04:42:38.910 --> 04:42:38.920 align:start position:0%
here today but over the years which have
 
04:42:40.628 --> 04:42:40.638 align:start position:0%
been sort of chocked up to being just
 
04:42:43.948 --> 04:42:43.958 align:start position:0%
random anecdotes are not that at all
 
04:42:45.788 --> 04:42:45.798 align:start position:0%
these are empirical studies that show
 
04:42:47.750 --> 04:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
there is a small percentage of the
 
04:42:50.230 --> 04:42:50.240 align:start position:0%
population who has been turned out again
 
04:42:52.430 --> 04:42:52.440 align:start position:0%
and again and again they happen to be a
 
04:42:54.310 --> 04:42:54.320 align:start position:0%
very complicated subset of the
 
04:42:56.910 --> 04:42:56.920 align:start position:0%
population the typically up to 70 plus
 
04:42:59.708 --> 04:42:59.718 align:start position:0%
percent have co-occurring issues but
 
04:43:01.150 --> 04:43:01.160 align:start position:0%
these are folks who are committing not
 
04:43:02.990 --> 04:43:03.000 align:start position:0%
violent crimes they're committing
 
04:43:04.830 --> 04:43:04.840 align:start position:0%
property crimes low-level crimes and
 
04:43:06.990 --> 04:43:07.000 align:start position:0%
continuously getting re-bailed
 
04:43:09.150 --> 04:43:09.160 align:start position:0%
if you take a look at this report you're
 
04:43:10.750 --> 04:43:10.760 align:start position:0%
going to see the millions and millions
 
04:43:12.830 --> 04:43:12.840 align:start position:0%
of dollars that that cost the state of
 
04:43:15.270 --> 04:43:15.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire just in
 
04:43:17.670 --> 04:43:17.680 align:start position:0%
Medicaid not to mention the cost of just
 
04:43:19.708 --> 04:43:19.718 align:start position:0%
the constant re bookings not to mention
 
04:43:21.390 --> 04:43:21.400 align:start position:0%
the stories that you'll hear probably
 
04:43:23.868 --> 04:43:23.878 align:start position:0%
from my law enforcement colleagues here
 
04:43:26.750 --> 04:43:26.760 align:start position:0%
about the frustration of seeing the same
 
04:43:28.470 --> 04:43:28.480 align:start position:0%
people bailed and then constantly re
 
04:43:31.110 --> 04:43:31.120 align:start position:0%
bailed and um much like you I was an
 
04:43:34.350 --> 04:43:34.360 align:start position:0%
elected official for 16 years I had
 
04:43:36.510 --> 04:43:36.520 align:start position:0%
constituents calling me asking me as a
 
04:43:39.190 --> 04:43:39.200 align:start position:0%
county attorney why was this person just
 
04:43:40.708 --> 04:43:40.718 align:start position:0%
bailed and they're back out and they
 
04:43:43.270 --> 04:43:43.280 align:start position:0%
broke into my store I'm a small business
 
04:43:45.670 --> 04:43:45.680 align:start position:0%
owner I can't afford this kind of
 
04:43:47.550 --> 04:43:47.560 align:start position:0%
situation how can this possibly happen
 
04:43:49.070 --> 04:43:49.080 align:start position:0%
when the courts of New Hampshire have
 
04:43:50.270 --> 04:43:50.280 align:start position:0%
bailed this
 
04:43:53.270 --> 04:43:53.280 align:start position:0%
person this bill is designed to look at
 
04:43:56.150 --> 04:43:56.160 align:start position:0%
that very issue it keeps so many of the
 
04:43:57.550 --> 04:43:57.560 align:start position:0%
other improvements that we've all talked
 
04:43:59.150 --> 04:43:59.160 align:start position:0%
about over the last seven years and have
 
04:44:01.990 --> 04:44:02.000 align:start position:0%
collaborated on but when you look at the
 
04:44:05.070 --> 04:44:05.080 align:start position:0%
three categories uh of what judges will
 
04:44:07.110 --> 04:44:07.120 align:start position:0%
be directed to look at it really gets to
 
04:44:10.470 --> 04:44:10.480 align:start position:0%
the heart of who is likely to appear in
 
04:44:11.550 --> 04:44:11.560 align:start position:0%
that subsequent
 
04:44:14.230 --> 04:44:14.240 align:start position:0%
hearing who is likely to remain safe in
 
04:44:16.750 --> 04:44:16.760 align:start position:0%
the community and keep us safe and also
 
04:44:19.070 --> 04:44:19.080 align:start position:0%
balancing how many people can we safely
 
04:44:20.788 --> 04:44:20.798 align:start position:0%
keep in the community we know we can do
 
04:44:23.470 --> 04:44:23.480 align:start position:0%
that and that's why this is not a repeal
 
04:44:27.510 --> 04:44:27.520 align:start position:0%
of uh the uh PR system we know that that
 
04:44:29.948 --> 04:44:29.958 align:start position:0%
can safely be done this bill strikes a
 
04:44:32.310 --> 04:44:32.320 align:start position:0%
really good balance to finally go after
 
04:44:35.230 --> 04:44:35.240 align:start position:0%
that subset that has been identified by
 
04:44:37.550 --> 04:44:37.560 align:start position:0%
an outside agency as being a real
 
04:44:41.990 --> 04:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
problem for the courts uh and will treat
 
04:44:44.590 --> 04:44:44.600 align:start position:0%
them fairly but will identify them in
 
04:44:47.590 --> 04:44:47.600 align:start position:0%
such a way as we can stop or put a
 
04:44:49.350 --> 04:44:49.360 align:start position:0%
stopper if you will in that revolving
 
04:44:51.910 --> 04:44:51.920 align:start position:0%
door that's the exciting aspect of this
 
04:44:53.868 --> 04:44:53.878 align:start position:0%
bill and look forward to the further
 
04:44:57.350 --> 04:44:57.360 align:start position:0%
discussion and for your consideration of
 
04:45:00.670 --> 04:45:00.680 align:start position:0%
it thank you gentlemen um and I'd like
 
04:45:02.788 --> 04:45:02.798 align:start position:0%
to extend thank you to you Mr Val for
 
04:45:04.350 --> 04:45:04.360 align:start position:0%
recognizing the work that we did put
 
04:45:07.590 --> 04:45:07.600 align:start position:0%
into this um many many hours last year
 
04:45:10.510 --> 04:45:10.520 align:start position:0%
to come up with a compromise Bill to um
 
04:45:14.030 --> 04:45:14.040 align:start position:0%
get some progress forward and I look
 
04:45:15.628 --> 04:45:15.638 align:start position:0%
forward to looking at this and and
 
04:45:18.550 --> 04:45:18.560 align:start position:0%
making further progress as well um I
 
04:45:20.788 --> 04:45:20.798 align:start position:0%
would also like to say that we I I'm
 
04:45:24.110 --> 04:45:24.120 align:start position:0%
intending to to make a um a subcommittee
 
04:45:27.990 --> 04:45:28.000 align:start position:0%
um in probably take about a week or so
 
04:45:29.670 --> 04:45:29.680 align:start position:0%
and I'd like both of you if you were
 
04:45:31.708 --> 04:45:31.718 align:start position:0%
available to work with us and with the
 
04:45:33.830 --> 04:45:33.840 align:start position:0%
court it's my understanding that this
 
04:45:35.788 --> 04:45:35.798 align:start position:0%
this wasn't socialized with the court
 
04:45:38.350 --> 04:45:38.360 align:start position:0%
first before it was submitted to us and
 
04:45:41.110 --> 04:45:41.120 align:start position:0%
they may have some concerns um not with
 
04:45:43.990 --> 04:45:44.000 align:start position:0%
regard to um the issues of who should
 
04:45:45.510 --> 04:45:45.520 align:start position:0%
and should not be held more about
 
04:45:47.670 --> 04:45:47.680 align:start position:0%
logistic type things so I think that
 
04:45:48.990 --> 04:45:49.000 align:start position:0%
that shouldn't be a problem for us to
 
04:45:50.670 --> 04:45:50.680 align:start position:0%
overcome and and get a good piece of
 
04:45:53.150 --> 04:45:53.160 align:start position:0%
legislation out um any questions from
 
04:45:53.160 --> 04:45:54.190 align:start position:0%
legislation out um any questions from
the

04:45:54.190 --> 04:45:54.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:45:57.230 --> 04:45:57.240 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you both for
 
04:46:00.390 --> 04:46:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:04.030 --> 04:46:04.040 align:start position:0%
today the chair calls um The Honorable
 
04:46:15.948 --> 04:46:15.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:17.910 --> 04:46:17.920 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chairman members of
 
04:46:19.868 --> 04:46:19.878 align:start position:0%
the committee uh for the record my name
 
04:46:21.910 --> 04:46:21.920 align:start position:0%
is Jay Rue mayor of Manchester I also
 
04:46:23.470 --> 04:46:23.480 align:start position:0%
want to extend my thanks to this
 
04:46:24.910 --> 04:46:24.920 align:start position:0%
committee being an elected official
 
04:46:27.190 --> 04:46:27.200 align:start position:0%
myself I recognize how difficult it can
 
04:46:29.030 --> 04:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
be when you're working through uh
 
04:46:31.030 --> 04:46:31.040 align:start position:0%
difficult nature uh difficult topics
 
04:46:33.190 --> 04:46:33.200 align:start position:0%
like this so I appreciate all the work
 
04:46:34.510 --> 04:46:34.520 align:start position:0%
that the previous legislature and
 
04:46:36.270 --> 04:46:36.280 align:start position:0%
Governor did to get us to this point
 
04:46:38.310 --> 04:46:38.320 align:start position:0%
today I also want to take a moment to
 
04:46:41.230 --> 04:46:41.240 align:start position:0%
thank uh Chief Maher and assistant Chief
 
04:46:43.510 --> 04:46:43.520 align:start position:0%
Louie who came up today from Manchester
 
04:46:45.830 --> 04:46:45.840 align:start position:0%
also to show their support uh for this
 
04:46:48.670 --> 04:46:48.680 align:start position:0%
effort to further work on PR
 
04:46:51.750 --> 04:46:51.760 align:start position:0%
bale as mayor my most important job is
 
04:46:54.510 --> 04:46:54.520 align:start position:0%
to keep the city safe and the safety of
 
04:46:58.030 --> 04:46:58.040 align:start position:0%
our city is absolutely nonnegotiable and
 
04:47:00.910 --> 04:47:00.920 align:start position:0%
the the simple truth is that when people
 
04:47:04.030 --> 04:47:04.040 align:start position:0%
are Bad actors when they are engaging in
 
04:47:05.548 --> 04:47:05.558 align:start position:0%
uh illegal activities they need to be
 
04:47:07.868 --> 04:47:07.878 align:start position:0%
held accountable for their actions I
 
04:47:11.230 --> 04:47:11.240 align:start position:0%
would give uh one example um in my past
 
04:47:12.750 --> 04:47:12.760 align:start position:0%
life I do believe that the criminal
 
04:47:15.310 --> 04:47:15.320 align:start position:0%
justice system can be rehabilitative and
 
04:47:17.030 --> 04:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
I do think that there are opportunities
 
04:47:18.868 --> 04:47:18.878 align:start position:0%
to take an individual who may be going
 
04:47:21.830 --> 04:47:21.840 align:start position:0%
on a bad path and reorient them and I
 
04:47:24.030 --> 04:47:24.040 align:start position:0%
would use my own example in my own life
 
04:47:27.070 --> 04:47:27.080 align:start position:0%
as testimony to that fact I've been very
 
04:47:28.270 --> 04:47:28.280 align:start position:0%
open about the fact that I've been in
 
04:47:31.830 --> 04:47:31.840 align:start position:0%
recovery for 14 years and but for uh my
 
04:47:33.030 --> 04:47:33.040 align:start position:0%
Association at the time with the
 
04:47:34.510 --> 04:47:34.520 align:start position:0%
criminal justice system I don't know
 
04:47:36.070 --> 04:47:36.080 align:start position:0%
that I would be sitting in this these
 
04:47:38.510 --> 04:47:38.520 align:start position:0%
seats so I think this part is twofold
 
04:47:40.150 --> 04:47:40.160 align:start position:0%
one there are Bad actors on the streets
 
04:47:42.310 --> 04:47:42.320 align:start position:0%
that have no place being on the streets
 
04:47:43.708 --> 04:47:43.718 align:start position:0%
of the city of Manchester or
 
04:47:45.430 --> 04:47:45.440 align:start position:0%
municipalities in the state of New
 
04:47:47.270 --> 04:47:47.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire additionally I do think that
 
04:47:48.670 --> 04:47:48.680 align:start position:0%
there are opportunities to take an
 
04:47:50.750 --> 04:47:50.760 align:start position:0%
individual and help make them a better
 
04:47:53.788 --> 04:47:53.798 align:start position:0%
person and a a good uh productive member
 
04:47:56.548 --> 04:47:56.558 align:start position:0%
of society the bottom line though is
 
04:47:57.788 --> 04:47:57.798 align:start position:0%
that if you are arrested for committing
 
04:47:59.390 --> 04:47:59.400 align:start position:0%
a violent crime particularly if you are
 
04:48:00.788 --> 04:48:00.798 align:start position:0%
out on bail you have no place on the
 
04:48:02.750 --> 04:48:02.760 align:start position:0%
streets of the city of Manchester other
 
04:48:04.788 --> 04:48:04.798 align:start position:0%
municipalities in our state and I think
 
04:48:06.390 --> 04:48:06.400 align:start position:0%
we had talked a little bit about this
 
04:48:08.110 --> 04:48:08.120 align:start position:0%
already but the the challenge that we
 
04:48:10.510 --> 04:48:10.520 align:start position:0%
run into Manchester is the the violent
 
04:48:13.470 --> 04:48:13.480 align:start position:0%
and the repeat offenders specifically so
 
04:48:15.110 --> 04:48:15.120 align:start position:0%
in speaking with our Police Department I
 
04:48:16.750 --> 04:48:16.760 align:start position:0%
just want to give a couple quick
 
04:48:20.150 --> 04:48:20.160 align:start position:0%
examples of uh what we experience uh in
 
04:48:22.150 --> 04:48:22.160 align:start position:0%
the city of Manchester so these
 
04:48:23.830 --> 04:48:23.840 align:start position:0%
following examples highlight this
 
04:48:25.910 --> 04:48:25.920 align:start position:0%
problem so individuals who were arrested
 
04:48:28.510 --> 04:48:28.520 align:start position:0%
for serious crimes released on PR bail
 
04:48:30.670 --> 04:48:30.680 align:start position:0%
only to be rearrested for the following
 
04:48:35.310 --> 04:48:35.320 align:start position:0%
crimes murder stalking stabbing assault
 
04:48:39.110 --> 04:48:39.120 align:start position:0%
and armed robbery I I appreciate the the
 
04:48:41.030 --> 04:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
opposing argument on this that we do not
 
04:48:43.910 --> 04:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
want to be locking up individuals for uh
 
04:48:45.910 --> 04:48:45.920 align:start position:0%
Petty crimes or or things that they're
 
04:48:48.230 --> 04:48:48.240 align:start position:0%
doing to subsist these are not those
 
04:48:49.788 --> 04:48:49.798 align:start position:0%
kinds of crimes and this is what we're
 
04:48:52.310 --> 04:48:52.320 align:start position:0%
dealing with in the city of Manchester
 
04:48:53.990 --> 04:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
and this isn't just anecdotal we have
 
04:48:56.030 --> 04:48:56.040 align:start position:0%
strong numbers uh to back this up and
 
04:48:57.150 --> 04:48:57.160 align:start position:0%
our police department has done an
 
04:48:58.548 --> 04:48:58.558 align:start position:0%
extraordinary job at being able to
 
04:49:00.548 --> 04:49:00.558 align:start position:0%
compile this data to make I think a
 
04:49:02.430 --> 04:49:02.440 align:start position:0%
compelling argument in favor of uh
 
04:49:05.470 --> 04:49:05.480 align:start position:0%
further reforming bail in 20124 there
 
04:49:05.480 --> 04:49:06.750 align:start position:0%
further reforming bail in 20124 there
were

04:49:06.750 --> 04:49:06.760 align:start position:0%
were
 
04:49:09.510 --> 04:49:09.520 align:start position:0%
2,971 adults arrested in the city of
 
04:49:11.110 --> 04:49:11.120 align:start position:0%
Manchester these individual ual
 
04:49:13.470 --> 04:49:13.480 align:start position:0%
accounted for
 
04:49:16.230 --> 04:49:16.240 align:start position:0%
4,551 arrests the gentleman before me
 
04:49:18.150 --> 04:49:18.160 align:start position:0%
spoke about this that is a a smaller
 
04:49:20.030 --> 04:49:20.040 align:start position:0%
subset of the population that is
 
04:49:22.390 --> 04:49:22.400 align:start position:0%
committing an egregious amount of crimes
 
04:49:24.390 --> 04:49:24.400 align:start position:0%
in the city of Manchester these numbers
 
04:49:27.270 --> 04:49:27.280 align:start position:0%
don't add up because 27% of them were
 
04:49:30.190 --> 04:49:30.200 align:start position:0%
arrested more than once so of the
 
04:49:35.270 --> 04:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
2971 individuals arrested 715 or 24% of
 
04:49:37.230 --> 04:49:37.240 align:start position:0%
them were out on bail at the time of
 
04:49:39.670 --> 04:49:39.680 align:start position:0%
that arrest so this creates multiple
 
04:49:42.070 --> 04:49:42.080 align:start position:0%
problems number one obviously for our
 
04:49:44.628 --> 04:49:44.638 align:start position:0%
city who is continuing to experience or
 
04:49:46.548 --> 04:49:46.558 align:start position:0%
become victims of these crimes but also
 
04:49:48.230 --> 04:49:48.240 align:start position:0%
for our Police Department you know not
 
04:49:49.628 --> 04:49:49.638 align:start position:0%
unlike other departments across the
 
04:49:52.310 --> 04:49:52.320 align:start position:0%
state we have we we roughly float around
 
04:49:54.788 --> 04:49:54.798 align:start position:0%
20 vacancies so we have fewer cops and
 
04:49:56.750 --> 04:49:56.760 align:start position:0%
we're asking them to do more with less
 
04:49:57.948 --> 04:49:57.958 align:start position:0%
because they're continuing to have to
 
04:50:00.270 --> 04:50:00.280 align:start position:0%
arrest the same individuals over and
 
04:50:02.708 --> 04:50:02.718 align:start position:0%
over again this is not sustainable we
 
04:50:04.590 --> 04:50:04.600 align:start position:0%
cannot continue down this path here in
 
04:50:05.628 --> 04:50:05.638 align:start position:0%
the city of
 
04:50:08.430 --> 04:50:08.440 align:start position:0%
Manchester there could be nothing so
 
04:50:10.910 --> 04:50:10.920 align:start position:0%
transformative for our city than to
 
04:50:13.150 --> 04:50:13.160 align:start position:0%
remove nearly 1,000 criminals from the
 
04:50:15.430 --> 04:50:15.440 align:start position:0%
streets of
 
04:50:17.510 --> 04:50:17.520 align:start position:0%
Manchester so in addition to the change
 
04:50:19.030 --> 04:50:19.040 align:start position:0%
in the city this would have a dramatic
 
04:50:21.390 --> 04:50:21.400 align:start position:0%
impact on law law enforcement as I I
 
04:50:23.430 --> 04:50:23.440 align:start position:0%
spoke to that the morale obviously in
 
04:50:25.190 --> 04:50:25.200 align:start position:0%
the the city of Manchester is high they
 
04:50:27.310 --> 04:50:27.320 align:start position:0%
are always going to do their jobs but
 
04:50:29.548 --> 04:50:29.558 align:start position:0%
this certainly creates a barrier for
 
04:50:31.470 --> 04:50:31.480 align:start position:0%
them and it makes it more difficult to
 
04:50:33.590 --> 04:50:33.600 align:start position:0%
do the jobs that they were trained and
 
04:50:36.030 --> 04:50:36.040 align:start position:0%
assigned to do uh so I I really
 
04:50:37.750 --> 04:50:37.760 align:start position:0%
appreciate the opportunity to be here
 
04:50:40.628 --> 04:50:40.638 align:start position:0%
today I I truly appreciate sincerely
 
04:50:42.390 --> 04:50:42.400 align:start position:0%
appreciate the work that this committee
 
04:50:44.750 --> 04:50:44.760 align:start position:0%
does um I again I recognize how
 
04:50:46.430 --> 04:50:46.440 align:start position:0%
difficult uh that the nature of your
 
04:50:48.190 --> 04:50:48.200 align:start position:0%
jobs are but I I I would really
 
04:50:49.948 --> 04:50:49.958 align:start position:0%
encourage you all to continue down this
 
04:50:51.430 --> 04:50:51.440 align:start position:0%
path let's find something that we can
 
04:50:53.350 --> 04:50:53.360 align:start position:0%
work with again there would be nothing
 
04:50:54.868 --> 04:50:54.878 align:start position:0%
so transformative for the city of
 
04:50:56.670 --> 04:50:56.680 align:start position:0%
Manchester than having something like
 
04:50:58.470 --> 04:50:58.480 align:start position:0%
this uh take effect where we could
 
04:51:00.270 --> 04:51:00.280 align:start position:0%
potentially remove a thousand criminals
 
04:51:03.110 --> 04:51:03.120 align:start position:0%
from our streets so thank you so
 
04:51:06.670 --> 04:51:06.680 align:start position:0%
much thank you Mr Mayor see you no
 
04:51:08.110 --> 04:51:08.120 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee thank you
 
04:51:11.230 --> 04:51:11.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:51:13.310 --> 04:51:13.320 align:start position:0%
the chair calls attorney Aon krian from
 
04:51:22.270 --> 04:51:22.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:24.390 --> 04:51:24.400 align:start position:0%
Court good afternoon members of the
 
04:51:26.548 --> 04:51:26.558 align:start position:0%
committee uh eron krian general counsel
 
04:51:28.548 --> 04:51:28.558 align:start position:0%
for the judicial branch and surely for
 
04:51:30.430 --> 04:51:30.440 align:start position:0%
those of you that are returning uh I'm a
 
04:51:32.590 --> 04:51:32.600 align:start position:0%
familiar face uh and we we saw a lot of
 
04:51:34.830 --> 04:51:34.840 align:start position:0%
each other when we were discussing uh
 
04:51:36.948 --> 04:51:36.958 align:start position:0%
bail last year and I appreciate so much
 
04:51:39.670 --> 04:51:39.680 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to work with you uh as
 
04:51:42.430 --> 04:51:42.440 align:start position:0%
you know uh there were a number of
 
04:51:44.030 --> 04:51:44.040 align:start position:0%
changes that the judicial branch made in
 
04:51:45.590 --> 04:51:45.600 align:start position:0%
order to effectuate the will of the
 
04:51:49.948 --> 04:51:49.958 align:start position:0%
legislature as as uh expressed in HB 318
 
04:51:51.910 --> 04:51:51.920 align:start position:0%
one of those was the hiring of three
 
04:51:55.310 --> 04:51:55.320 align:start position:0%
judicial officers um who quit their jobs
 
04:51:57.788 --> 04:51:57.798 align:start position:0%
became magistrates and and have very
 
04:51:59.708 --> 04:51:59.718 align:start position:0%
extensive backgrounds as police officers
 
04:52:02.070 --> 04:52:02.080 align:start position:0%
as defense attorneys and as prosecutors
 
04:52:04.190 --> 04:52:04.200 align:start position:0%
um that that prepared them well uh
 
04:52:07.670 --> 04:52:07.680 align:start position:0%
underwent extensive training as well um
 
04:52:09.670 --> 04:52:09.680 align:start position:0%
I see this amendment uh and I I think
 
04:52:11.070 --> 04:52:11.080 align:start position:0%
there are many positive changes in the
 
04:52:12.708 --> 04:52:12.718 align:start position:0%
amendment but I believe that this
 
04:52:14.990 --> 04:52:15.000 align:start position:0%
preserves a portion of the underlying
 
04:52:18.910 --> 04:52:18.920 align:start position:0%
bill which um in relatively short order
 
04:52:22.070 --> 04:52:22.080 align:start position:0%
abolishes those positions uh what I
 
04:52:25.510 --> 04:52:25.520 align:start position:0%
might suggest to you is that uh those
 
04:52:28.110 --> 04:52:28.120 align:start position:0%
they were appointed to 5e terms you may
 
04:52:30.548 --> 04:52:30.558 align:start position:0%
wish to Sunset the position at the end
 
04:52:32.590 --> 04:52:32.600 align:start position:0%
of the terms as opposed to immediate
 
04:52:35.868 --> 04:52:35.878 align:start position:0%
abolition um in recognition that uh
 
04:52:37.470 --> 04:52:37.480 align:start position:0%
these judicial officers did accept that
 
04:52:39.788 --> 04:52:39.798 align:start position:0%
position for the purpose of implementing
 
04:52:41.830 --> 04:52:41.840 align:start position:0%
your your design your will um they are
 
04:52:44.070 --> 04:52:44.080 align:start position:0%
public servants um or just have mercy on
 
04:52:45.230 --> 04:52:45.240 align:start position:0%
me as someone who defends the branch
 
04:52:49.590 --> 04:52:49.600 align:start position:0%
from employment actions um but uh that
 
04:52:50.788 --> 04:52:50.798 align:start position:0%
is something that I put to your
 
04:52:52.350 --> 04:52:52.360 align:start position:0%
consideration even if you determine that
 
04:52:53.470 --> 04:52:53.480 align:start position:0%
that's not something you do want to
 
04:52:55.150 --> 04:52:55.160 align:start position:0%
preserve whether you would at least like
 
04:52:56.708 --> 04:52:56.718 align:start position:0%
to consider sun setting at the end of
 
04:52:58.150 --> 04:52:58.160 align:start position:0%
their current term which is a five-year
 
04:53:00.868 --> 04:53:00.878 align:start position:0%
term um the magistrates although they
 
04:53:02.910 --> 04:53:02.920 align:start position:0%
are highly qualified and highly trained
 
04:53:05.030 --> 04:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
cost about half as much as a full-time
 
04:53:06.948 --> 04:53:06.958 align:start position:0%
judge I think it's actually less than
 
04:53:09.430 --> 04:53:09.440 align:start position:0%
half um and they perform many many
 
04:53:11.230 --> 04:53:11.240 align:start position:0%
routine functions that up judges time
 
04:53:14.350 --> 04:53:14.360 align:start position:0%
and push out calendars uh for other
 
04:53:16.788 --> 04:53:16.798 align:start position:0%
cases um the Circuit Court retook the
 
04:53:19.190 --> 04:53:19.200 align:start position:0%
initial proceedings relating to felonies
 
04:53:20.910 --> 04:53:20.920 align:start position:0%
relatively recently that that came with
 
04:53:23.788 --> 04:53:23.798 align:start position:0%
no additional staff or resources the the
 
04:53:25.390 --> 04:53:25.400 align:start position:0%
help of the magistrates in processing
 
04:53:28.270 --> 04:53:28.280 align:start position:0%
many of those preliminary hearings is is
 
04:53:30.590 --> 04:53:30.600 align:start position:0%
very valuable in defraying costs for the
 
04:53:31.788 --> 04:53:31.798 align:start position:0%
court and moving some of those
 
04:53:33.948 --> 04:53:33.958 align:start position:0%
proceedings along uh so I put that to
 
04:53:35.548 --> 04:53:35.558 align:start position:0%
your consideration is of course always
 
04:53:37.948 --> 04:53:37.958 align:start position:0%
the determination of the legislature um
 
04:53:39.670 --> 04:53:39.680 align:start position:0%
the way to move forward but I I at least
 
04:53:40.948 --> 04:53:40.958 align:start position:0%
want to raise
 
04:53:42.390 --> 04:53:42.400 align:start position:0%
those questions for your
 
04:53:44.670 --> 04:53:44.680 align:start position:0%
consideration um in my first review of
 
04:53:47.590 --> 04:53:47.600 align:start position:0%
the original uh draft of this bill um I
 
04:53:48.708 --> 04:53:48.718 align:start position:0%
haven't had an opportunity to work with
 
04:53:50.030 --> 04:53:50.040 align:start position:0%
my friends and colleagues in the
 
04:53:51.310 --> 04:53:51.320 align:start position:0%
executive branch on it but I look
 
04:53:53.230 --> 04:53:53.240 align:start position:0%
forward to doing that I did note that
 
04:53:56.390 --> 04:53:56.400 align:start position:0%
there were some potentially um drafting
 
04:53:57.868 --> 04:53:57.878 align:start position:0%
errors um for example I saw that
 
04:53:59.750 --> 04:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
detention was accidentally eliminated as
 
04:54:02.310 --> 04:54:02.320 align:start position:0%
an option on first appearance and that
 
04:54:03.670 --> 04:54:03.680 align:start position:0%
the assumption that a victim would not
 
04:54:06.270 --> 04:54:06.280 align:start position:0%
have to testify in person was um was
 
04:54:08.030 --> 04:54:08.040 align:start position:0%
accidentally eliminated I I I assume
 
04:54:09.190 --> 04:54:09.200 align:start position:0%
that those were accidents and I see that
 
04:54:11.270 --> 04:54:11.280 align:start position:0%
those have been correct in this version
 
04:54:12.628 --> 04:54:12.638 align:start position:0%
I haven't had a chance to review it
 
04:54:15.070 --> 04:54:15.080 align:start position:0%
extensively but there are a couple
 
04:54:17.670 --> 04:54:17.680 align:start position:0%
relatively logistical minor issues that
 
04:54:19.230 --> 04:54:19.240 align:start position:0%
uh may be worthy of the legislator's
 
04:54:21.470 --> 04:54:21.480 align:start position:0%
consideration for example uh another
 
04:54:22.590 --> 04:54:22.600 align:start position:0%
section of this bill which doesn't
 
04:54:25.708 --> 04:54:25.718 align:start position:0%
appear in this amendment um abolishes a
 
04:54:29.670 --> 04:54:29.680 align:start position:0%
provision that times first hearings that
 
04:54:31.270 --> 04:54:31.280 align:start position:0%
uh typically saves a lot of time in the
 
04:54:33.110 --> 04:54:33.120 align:start position:0%
morning docket and I'd love to speak
 
04:54:35.628 --> 04:54:35.638 align:start position:0%
with the sponsors about what their um
 
04:54:37.070 --> 04:54:37.080 align:start position:0%
what their legislative intention is in
 
04:54:38.350 --> 04:54:38.360 align:start position:0%
doing that and see if there would be a
 
04:54:41.150 --> 04:54:41.160 align:start position:0%
way to effeti it that would not require
 
04:54:43.350 --> 04:54:43.360 align:start position:0%
um morning hearings to all be stalled
 
04:54:44.868 --> 04:54:44.878 align:start position:0%
while we're waiting for attorneys which
 
04:54:46.270 --> 04:54:46.280 align:start position:0%
is the original reason that the
 
04:54:48.548 --> 04:54:48.558 align:start position:0%
legislature had passed that change um so
 
04:54:50.110 --> 04:54:50.120 align:start position:0%
there are a few logistical matters but
 
04:54:51.430 --> 04:54:51.440 align:start position:0%
of course if those of you that worked
 
04:54:53.190 --> 04:54:53.200 align:start position:0%
with me last year know that the the
 
04:54:54.830 --> 04:54:54.840 align:start position:0%
judicial branch certainly understands
 
04:54:57.150 --> 04:54:57.160 align:start position:0%
that we implement the laws that you
 
04:54:59.910 --> 04:54:59.920 align:start position:0%
write the policy determination is yours
 
04:55:01.670 --> 04:55:01.680 align:start position:0%
we will work with you on whatever it is
 
04:55:03.990 --> 04:55:04.000 align:start position:0%
that you determine is best to do uh
 
04:55:05.590 --> 04:55:05.600 align:start position:0%
there are no two states that have
 
04:55:08.070 --> 04:55:08.080 align:start position:0%
identical bail laws there is a very wide
 
04:55:09.788 --> 04:55:09.798 align:start position:0%
range of policy solutions that the
 
04:55:12.430 --> 04:55:12.440 align:start position:0%
judicial bran Branch can Implement um
 
04:55:13.910 --> 04:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
and we're very very happy to work with
 
04:55:16.030 --> 04:55:16.040 align:start position:0%
you to see that we can Implement your
 
04:55:18.670 --> 04:55:18.680 align:start position:0%
design and your policy
 
04:55:22.708 --> 04:55:22.718 align:start position:0%
attention thank you um I can speaking
 
04:55:25.030 --> 04:55:25.040 align:start position:0%
for this committee as a part of the
 
04:55:27.470 --> 04:55:27.480 align:start position:0%
legislature it's important for us that
 
04:55:30.470 --> 04:55:30.480 align:start position:0%
when we craft legislation that the
 
04:55:32.548 --> 04:55:32.558 align:start position:0%
people that we ask to do are able to
 
04:55:34.750 --> 04:55:34.760 align:start position:0%
carry it out so that's why I think it's
 
04:55:36.470 --> 04:55:36.480 align:start position:0%
very important that we get together with
 
04:55:39.948 --> 04:55:39.958 align:start position:0%
the court and the the sponsors and make
 
04:55:42.670 --> 04:55:42.680 align:start position:0%
sure that we can it's actually doable
 
04:55:44.310 --> 04:55:44.320 align:start position:0%
and we do it right the first time
 
04:55:46.470 --> 04:55:46.480 align:start position:0%
because I I swear I'm not going to deal
 
04:55:51.110 --> 04:55:51.120 align:start position:0%
with bail again next year this is it um
 
04:55:52.830 --> 04:55:52.840 align:start position:0%
having said that any questions regarding
 
04:55:52.840 --> 04:55:54.270 align:start position:0%
having said that any questions regarding
the

04:55:54.270 --> 04:55:54.280 align:start position:0%

uh the director of the criminal Practice
 
04:56:33.030 --> 04:56:33.040 align:start position:0%
Clinic at UNH law prior to joining UNH
 
04:56:34.788 --> 04:56:34.798 align:start position:0%
law uh I was a public defender in New
 
04:56:36.470 --> 04:56:36.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for 15 years so I've been a
 
04:56:38.390 --> 04:56:38.400 align:start position:0%
criminal defense practitioner for 20
 
04:56:40.430 --> 04:56:40.440 align:start position:0%
years I'm not here on behalf of the
 
04:56:42.390 --> 04:56:42.400 align:start position:0%
University of New Hampshire on behalf of
 
04:56:43.830 --> 04:56:43.840 align:start position:0%
I'm here on behalf of the New Hampshire
 
04:56:45.990 --> 04:56:46.000 align:start position:0%
Association of criminal defense lawyers
 
04:56:47.430 --> 04:56:47.440 align:start position:0%
um I guess the first thing I'd like to
 
04:56:50.430 --> 04:56:50.440 align:start position:0%
say is obviously um you know when baale
 
04:56:53.868 --> 04:56:53.878 align:start position:0%
reform first came about um and uh you
 
04:56:55.628 --> 04:56:55.638 align:start position:0%
obviously was here during that practice
 
04:56:57.628 --> 04:56:57.638 align:start position:0%
um we understood the main focus and the
 
04:57:01.030 --> 04:57:01.040 align:start position:0%
primary focus um to be making sure that
 
04:57:02.788 --> 04:57:02.798 align:start position:0%
people were not held on low amounts of
 
04:57:04.430 --> 04:57:04.440 align:start position:0%
cash bail they were not held on low
 
04:57:06.910 --> 04:57:06.920 align:start position:0%
amounts of cash bail um for you know
 
04:57:09.030 --> 04:57:09.040 align:start position:0%
minor crimes such that poor people were
 
04:57:10.708 --> 04:57:10.718 align:start position:0%
being held in jail for significant
 
04:57:12.628 --> 04:57:12.638 align:start position:0%
sentences beyond anything they would
 
04:57:15.708 --> 04:57:15.718 align:start position:0%
ever possibly face um as a sentence in a
 
04:57:17.948 --> 04:57:17.958 align:start position:0%
case um simply because they did not have
 
04:57:20.230 --> 04:57:20.240 align:start position:0%
the means um or the money to post bail
 
04:57:22.670 --> 04:57:22.680 align:start position:0%
in a matter that substantially has gone
 
04:57:24.750 --> 04:57:24.760 align:start position:0%
away I don't have clients um in those
 
04:57:26.430 --> 04:57:26.440 align:start position:0%
situations due to bail reform and that's
 
04:57:28.750 --> 04:57:28.760 align:start position:0%
significant um in this case and and
 
04:57:30.590 --> 04:57:30.600 align:start position:0%
matters um because of the efforts of
 
04:57:32.470 --> 04:57:32.480 align:start position:0%
this of this legislature and the work
 
04:57:34.470 --> 04:57:34.480 align:start position:0%
that's been done on bail reform I
 
04:57:35.910 --> 04:57:35.920 align:start position:0%
understand and I've followed obviously
 
04:57:37.430 --> 04:57:37.440 align:start position:0%
as a practitioner over the years the
 
04:57:39.430 --> 04:57:39.440 align:start position:0%
number of bail um the the number of
 
04:57:41.070 --> 04:57:41.080 align:start position:0%
amendments that have to bail reform
 
04:57:43.190 --> 04:57:43.200 align:start position:0%
issue and the reasons why um and I
 
04:57:45.030 --> 04:57:45.040 align:start position:0%
actually appreciate uh attorney valard
 
04:57:47.390 --> 04:57:47.400 align:start position:0%
raising an issue here um and agree with
 
04:57:49.190 --> 04:57:49.200 align:start position:0%
him U we practice together a long time
 
04:57:50.990 --> 04:57:51.000 align:start position:0%
and so um you know we know probably some
 
04:57:52.310 --> 04:57:52.320 align:start position:0%
of the same people that we're talking
 
04:57:54.070 --> 04:57:54.080 align:start position:0%
about here but when we're talking about
 
04:57:56.830 --> 04:57:56.840 align:start position:0%
this um population um that is sort of
 
04:57:59.110 --> 04:57:59.120 align:start position:0%
the ones that are um consistently coming
 
04:58:00.670 --> 04:58:00.680 align:start position:0%
before the courts that are consistently
 
04:58:03.390 --> 04:58:03.400 align:start position:0%
being arrested uh he used the term co-
 
04:58:05.430 --> 04:58:05.440 align:start position:0%
co-occurring disorder and I just want to
 
04:58:06.830 --> 04:58:06.840 align:start position:0%
make sure that everybody understands
 
04:58:08.110 --> 04:58:08.120 align:start position:0%
exactly what that means in this
 
04:58:10.230 --> 04:58:10.240 align:start position:0%
situation these are people who are are
 
04:58:13.190 --> 04:58:13.200 align:start position:0%
suffering from um likely both uh
 
04:58:15.190 --> 04:58:15.200 align:start position:0%
substance misuse disorders and
 
04:58:17.310 --> 04:58:17.320 align:start position:0%
significant mental health conditions um
 
04:58:18.788 --> 04:58:18.798 align:start position:0%
these are people who are you know we are
 
04:58:20.430 --> 04:58:20.440 align:start position:0%
trying to help in our Comm in our
 
04:58:22.270 --> 04:58:22.280 align:start position:0%
communities and I would note that you
 
04:58:23.910 --> 04:58:23.920 align:start position:0%
know the battle on the opiate crisis
 
04:58:25.868 --> 04:58:25.878 align:start position:0%
while long and hard we are gaining
 
04:58:27.948 --> 04:58:27.958 align:start position:0%
ground the number of overdoses are down
 
04:58:30.390 --> 04:58:30.400 align:start position:0%
in this state substantially um and it's
 
04:58:32.430 --> 04:58:32.440 align:start position:0%
making a significant difference and so I
 
04:58:34.150 --> 04:58:34.160 align:start position:0%
would say that this population is
 
04:58:36.548 --> 04:58:36.558 align:start position:0%
challenging and and we do absolutely
 
04:58:38.910 --> 04:58:38.920 align:start position:0%
understand that um in this situation but
 
04:58:40.670 --> 04:58:40.680 align:start position:0%
these are folks who are struggling um
 
04:58:41.910 --> 04:58:41.920 align:start position:0%
with these things and could greatly
 
04:58:44.070 --> 04:58:44.080 align:start position:0%
benefit um from the services in the
 
04:58:46.110 --> 04:58:46.120 align:start position:0%
community that are being provided so far
 
04:58:47.670 --> 04:58:47.680 align:start position:0%
in terms of Community Mental Health
 
04:58:49.868 --> 04:58:49.878 align:start position:0%
agencies um as well as access to
 
04:58:51.708 --> 04:58:51.718 align:start position:0%
treatment the other thing I'll say is
 
04:58:53.350 --> 04:58:53.360 align:start position:0%
overall my understands violent crime is
 
04:58:55.390 --> 04:58:55.400 align:start position:0%
down in New Hampshire um and so this
 
04:58:56.910 --> 04:58:56.920 align:start position:0%
response while I understand the number
 
04:58:59.470 --> 04:58:59.480 align:start position:0%
of um you know uh people here who may be
 
04:59:01.590 --> 04:59:01.600 align:start position:0%
sharing individual stories overall the
 
04:59:03.948 --> 04:59:03.958 align:start position:0%
picture is that violent crime is down um
 
04:59:06.868 --> 04:59:06.878 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire this
 
04:59:10.110 --> 04:59:10.120 align:start position:0%
um this committee and last year as well
 
04:59:12.390 --> 04:59:12.400 align:start position:0%
put a lot I'm aware of work into a
 
04:59:14.310 --> 04:59:14.320 align:start position:0%
significant compromise bill and I would
 
04:59:16.430 --> 04:59:16.440 align:start position:0%
absolutely call it a compromise bill in
 
04:59:18.510 --> 04:59:18.520 align:start position:0%
this situation um when looking at you
 
04:59:20.670 --> 04:59:20.680 align:start position:0%
know what went into it the thought that
 
04:59:23.548 --> 04:59:23.558 align:start position:0%
um specific crimes and specific violent
 
04:59:25.430 --> 04:59:25.440 align:start position:0%
crimes were identified as really high
 
04:59:28.628 --> 04:59:28.638 align:start position:0%
risk in the situation um and um the
 
04:59:30.270 --> 04:59:30.280 align:start position:0%
significant consequences of people
 
04:59:32.390 --> 04:59:32.400 align:start position:0%
violating bail when charged with those
 
04:59:35.270 --> 04:59:35.280 align:start position:0%
types of crimes um is understandable and
 
04:59:37.470 --> 04:59:37.480 align:start position:0%
it was probably inevitable that bail
 
04:59:39.150 --> 04:59:39.160 align:start position:0%
reform would lead to that kind of
 
04:59:41.470 --> 04:59:41.480 align:start position:0%
legislation um for those types of crimes
 
04:59:44.190 --> 04:59:44.200 align:start position:0%
and so absolutely understandable uh but
 
04:59:46.470 --> 04:59:46.480 align:start position:0%
the concern is that um you know at this
 
04:59:48.390 --> 04:59:48.400 align:start position:0%
point we're going to get back caught up
 
04:59:51.270 --> 04:59:51.280 align:start position:0%
again in uh people being held on amounts
 
04:59:53.310 --> 04:59:53.320 align:start position:0%
of cash bail that they cannot post
 
04:59:54.948 --> 04:59:54.958 align:start position:0%
because they do not have the means to do
 
04:59:57.390 --> 04:59:57.400 align:start position:0%
so when people who do have means and
 
04:59:58.948 --> 04:59:58.958 align:start position:0%
maybe um you know have committed the
 
05:00:01.230 --> 05:00:01.240 align:start position:0%
same crimes or have the same criminal
 
05:00:04.510 --> 05:00:04.520 align:start position:0%
history or have the same um you know uh
 
05:00:06.990 --> 05:00:07.000 align:start position:0%
uh underlying conduct can be released in
 
05:00:09.150 --> 05:00:09.160 align:start position:0%
these situations um you know we are
 
05:00:12.030 --> 05:00:12.040 align:start position:0%
concerned obviously in the situation we
 
05:00:13.430 --> 05:00:13.440 align:start position:0%
understand the failures to appear and
 
05:00:15.190 --> 05:00:15.200 align:start position:0%
the concerns over the failures to appear
 
05:00:17.190 --> 05:00:17.200 align:start position:0%
by the courts in these programs um there
 
05:00:18.868 --> 05:00:18.878 align:start position:0%
have been efforts by the courts to deal
 
05:00:20.510 --> 05:00:20.520 align:start position:0%
with this and so it's my understanding
 
05:00:22.150 --> 05:00:22.160 align:start position:0%
there's a pilot program in Rockingham
 
05:00:24.708 --> 05:00:24.718 align:start position:0%
County to start making um text messages
 
05:00:27.390 --> 05:00:27.400 align:start position:0%
available to uh individuals in order to
 
05:00:28.990 --> 05:00:29.000 align:start position:0%
remind them of their court dates you
 
05:00:30.948 --> 05:00:30.958 align:start position:0%
know these are transient populations who
 
05:00:33.670 --> 05:00:33.680 align:start position:0%
oftentimes um don't get mail and um
 
05:00:35.628 --> 05:00:35.638 align:start position:0%
often times are unable to access
 
05:00:37.830 --> 05:00:37.840 align:start position:0%
anything other than maybe um a text
 
05:00:39.430 --> 05:00:39.440 align:start position:0%
message system when they have a Wi-Fi
 
05:00:41.548 --> 05:00:41.558 align:start position:0%
connection which um fortunately is
 
05:00:43.190 --> 05:00:43.200 align:start position:0%
around um so these are individuals who
 
05:00:45.190 --> 05:00:45.200 align:start position:0%
can be reminded by the court by um some
 
05:00:46.868 --> 05:00:46.878 align:start position:0%
pilot programs that are coming into
 
05:00:49.590 --> 05:00:49.600 align:start position:0%
place I would say additionally it's my
 
05:00:51.708 --> 05:00:51.718 align:start position:0%
understanding that there's a new system
 
05:00:53.590 --> 05:00:53.600 align:start position:0%
that may make information about who
 
05:00:56.510 --> 05:00:56.520 align:start position:0%
exactly is on bail um become more
 
05:00:58.868 --> 05:00:58.878 align:start position:0%
available by entering it into the ncic
 
05:01:00.590 --> 05:01:00.600 align:start position:0%
system that's incredibly important
 
05:01:03.350 --> 05:01:03.360 align:start position:0%
because my experience in all of this is
 
05:01:05.070 --> 05:01:05.080 align:start position:0%
you every iteration of bail reform
 
05:01:06.310 --> 05:01:06.320 align:start position:0%
that's been concerned about people
 
05:01:08.628 --> 05:01:08.638 align:start position:0%
committing crimes on bail the law has
 
05:01:11.230 --> 05:01:11.240 align:start position:0%
already provided um the ability for
 
05:01:13.948 --> 05:01:13.958 align:start position:0%
people's baales to be Revisited uh
 
05:01:16.310 --> 05:01:16.320 align:start position:0%
amended and revoked is should they
 
05:01:18.150 --> 05:01:18.160 align:start position:0%
violate their conditions of bail the
 
05:01:20.070 --> 05:01:20.080 align:start position:0%
problem is finding you know is is
 
05:01:22.350 --> 05:01:22.360 align:start position:0%
initiating that process making those
 
05:01:25.190 --> 05:01:25.200 align:start position:0%
that underlying information known um and
 
05:01:27.310 --> 05:01:27.320 align:start position:0%
I think alleviating some of the work on
 
05:01:29.548 --> 05:01:29.558 align:start position:0%
prosecutors in these situations that
 
05:01:31.270 --> 05:01:31.280 align:start position:0%
kind of system would make it known to
 
05:01:33.670 --> 05:01:33.680 align:start position:0%
police officers and prosecutors who is
 
05:01:36.470 --> 05:01:36.480 align:start position:0%
on bail in individual situations um and
 
05:01:38.030 --> 05:01:38.040 align:start position:0%
make it more likely that you know the
 
05:01:39.548 --> 05:01:39.558 align:start position:0%
types of motions that have always been
 
05:01:41.030 --> 05:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
avail ailable and are currently
 
05:01:44.070 --> 05:01:44.080 align:start position:0%
available under this law um uh can be
 
05:01:46.070 --> 05:01:46.080 align:start position:0%
filed with a court and heard by a
 
05:01:47.708 --> 05:01:47.718 align:start position:0%
magistrate or judge to make a
 
05:01:49.830 --> 05:01:49.840 align:start position:0%
determination about bail in this matter
 
05:01:53.150 --> 05:01:53.160 align:start position:0%
our position is that um you know the the
 
05:01:55.590 --> 05:01:55.600 align:start position:0%
this the um bill that came through last
 
05:01:57.430 --> 05:01:57.440 align:start position:0%
year through a lot of hard work by
 
05:02:00.190 --> 05:02:00.200 align:start position:0%
everyone here um is just getting started
 
05:02:02.590 --> 05:02:02.600 align:start position:0%
it's January 29th um and it started
 
05:02:04.390 --> 05:02:04.400 align:start position:0%
January 1st these magistrates just got
 
05:02:06.788 --> 05:02:06.798 align:start position:0%
to work we are currently um you know uh
 
05:02:08.110 --> 05:02:08.120 align:start position:0%
working with them and seeing you know
 
05:02:10.750 --> 05:02:10.760 align:start position:0%
what this system produces uh to not give
 
05:02:12.910 --> 05:02:12.920 align:start position:0%
it the opportunity to do so we feel um
 
05:02:16.230 --> 05:02:16.240 align:start position:0%
is sort of um unfortunate because uh
 
05:02:18.110 --> 05:02:18.120 align:start position:0%
it's a bill that really tackles all the
 
05:02:20.590 --> 05:02:20.600 align:start position:0%
complications um that bail reform
 
05:02:23.708 --> 05:02:23.718 align:start position:0%
probably would probably did bring about
 
05:02:25.628 --> 05:02:25.638 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to
 
05:02:28.190 --> 05:02:28.200 align:start position:0%
speak thank you for coming to see us
 
05:02:28.200 --> 05:02:32.470 align:start position:0%
speak thank you for coming to see us
today

05:02:32.470 --> 05:02:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:49.628 --> 05:02:49.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:51.990 --> 05:02:52.000 align:start position:0%
turn it off good afternoon thank you Mr
 
05:02:53.470 --> 05:02:53.480 align:start position:0%
chair thank you members of the committee
 
05:02:55.070 --> 05:02:55.080 align:start position:0%
uh for the record on major Chris Bashaw
 
05:02:56.590 --> 05:02:56.600 align:start position:0%
of the Rockingham County Sheriff's
 
05:02:59.030 --> 05:02:59.040 align:start position:0%
Office uh and we are here in support of
 
05:03:00.628 --> 05:03:00.638 align:start position:0%
uh the bill with the amendment as
 
05:03:02.948 --> 05:03:02.958 align:start position:0%
proposed uh and supported by the
 
05:03:05.590 --> 05:03:05.600 align:start position:0%
governor's office um there are some
 
05:03:06.990 --> 05:03:07.000 align:start position:0%
you're going to hear stories of some of
 
05:03:08.708 --> 05:03:08.718 align:start position:0%
the more egregious cases for some of the
 
05:03:10.310 --> 05:03:10.320 align:start position:0%
very violent crimes people have been out
 
05:03:12.190 --> 05:03:12.200 align:start position:0%
and reoffended I'm going to speak more
 
05:03:13.430 --> 05:03:13.440 align:start position:0%
from a unique perspective of the
 
05:03:16.070 --> 05:03:16.080 align:start position:0%
sheriff's office um and we get a lot we
 
05:03:17.590 --> 05:03:17.600 align:start position:0%
get all the Superior Court warrants that
 
05:03:19.510 --> 05:03:19.520 align:start position:0%
come from the uh Rockingham County New
 
05:03:21.868 --> 05:03:21.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and we have to enter those and
 
05:03:23.350 --> 05:03:23.360 align:start position:0%
we go out and try to affect those at any
 
05:03:25.070 --> 05:03:25.080 align:start position:0%
given time we usually maintain anywhere
 
05:03:27.868 --> 05:03:27.878 align:start position:0%
between a, 1200 uh active warrants from
 
05:03:30.150 --> 05:03:30.160 align:start position:0%
the Superior Court uh and we track these
 
05:03:31.708 --> 05:03:31.718 align:start position:0%
folks down all over the county all over
 
05:03:33.470 --> 05:03:33.480 align:start position:0%
the state uh we extradite them from all
 
05:03:35.390 --> 05:03:35.400 align:start position:0%
over the country uh depending on the
 
05:03:37.830 --> 05:03:37.840 align:start position:0%
seriousness of the crime and since uh a
 
05:03:39.310 --> 05:03:39.320 align:start position:0%
lot of the initiatives of bail reform
 
05:03:41.628 --> 05:03:41.638 align:start position:0%
there have quite a few uh repeat
 
05:03:44.230 --> 05:03:44.240 align:start position:0%
offenders and frequent flyers uh who
 
05:03:45.868 --> 05:03:45.878 align:start position:0%
really just you know they've obviously
 
05:03:47.390 --> 05:03:47.400 align:start position:0%
been able to manipulate the system and
 
05:03:50.430 --> 05:03:50.440 align:start position:0%
fly in the face of law enforcement it's
 
05:03:52.990 --> 05:03:53.000 align:start position:0%
uh very disheartening when you see
 
05:03:56.190 --> 05:03:56.200 align:start position:0%
felony level cases uh and then new
 
05:03:57.628 --> 05:03:57.638 align:start position:0%
warrants are coming out with judges
 
05:04:00.150 --> 05:04:00.160 align:start position:0%
orders of to arrest for failures to
 
05:04:01.990 --> 05:04:02.000 align:start position:0%
appear and they come to us and they're
 
05:04:04.070 --> 05:04:04.080 align:start position:0%
already preset with a pre personal
 
05:04:06.150 --> 05:04:06.160 align:start position:0%
recognizance bail even from the court on
 
05:04:08.470 --> 05:04:08.480 align:start position:0%
these repeat offenders and these folks
 
05:04:10.548 --> 05:04:10.558 align:start position:0%
are treating that might as well be a
 
05:04:12.030 --> 05:04:12.040 align:start position:0%
late payment notice for your credit card
 
05:04:13.590 --> 05:04:13.600 align:start position:0%
to some of these folks where they
 
05:04:14.670 --> 05:04:14.680 align:start position:0%
actually laugh in the face of the
 
05:04:16.628 --> 05:04:16.638 align:start position:0%
deputies when they show up and they say
 
05:04:17.990 --> 05:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
Hey you know should I just have my ride
 
05:04:19.390 --> 05:04:19.400 align:start position:0%
pick me up in 30 minutes we both know
 
05:04:21.190 --> 05:04:21.200 align:start position:0%
I'm going to be out of here soon um so
 
05:04:22.750 --> 05:04:22.760 align:start position:0%
it's it's very disheartening obviously
 
05:04:23.910 --> 05:04:23.920 align:start position:0%
our folks always want to go out there
 
05:04:25.310 --> 05:04:25.320 align:start position:0%
and do their job but when they continue
 
05:04:27.430 --> 05:04:27.440 align:start position:0%
to see these folks uh can create some
 
05:04:30.750 --> 05:04:30.760 align:start position:0%
dangerous situations as well because now
 
05:04:32.628 --> 05:04:32.638 align:start position:0%
we do have an arrest warrant that's set
 
05:04:34.310 --> 05:04:34.320 align:start position:0%
with a personal recogniz and bail but we
 
05:04:35.548 --> 05:04:35.558 align:start position:0%
still have a duty to go affect that
 
05:04:38.030 --> 05:04:38.040 align:start position:0%
arrest of warrant and some folks don't
 
05:04:39.470 --> 05:04:39.480 align:start position:0%
want to be arrested on that even though
 
05:04:41.548 --> 05:04:41.558 align:start position:0%
they probably will be processed and uh
 
05:04:43.548 --> 05:04:43.558 align:start position:0%
out of there and bailed again uh within
 
05:04:45.750 --> 05:04:45.760 align:start position:0%
30 minutes uh and it's created
 
05:04:48.150 --> 05:04:48.160 align:start position:0%
situations that's put defendants at risk
 
05:04:49.868 --> 05:04:49.878 align:start position:0%
where we have to forcibly remove them
 
05:04:51.910 --> 05:04:51.920 align:start position:0%
they resist arrest they fight with our
 
05:04:54.190 --> 05:04:54.200 align:start position:0%
deputies and local police officers so
 
05:04:55.670 --> 05:04:55.680 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of situations where it's
 
05:04:58.548 --> 05:04:58.558 align:start position:0%
created these problems and we just it's
 
05:05:00.310 --> 05:05:00.320 align:start position:0%
really disheartening uh from our an
 
05:05:01.868 --> 05:05:01.878 align:start position:0%
enforcement standpoint to do all this
 
05:05:03.750 --> 05:05:03.760 align:start position:0%
work and tremendous resources as a
 
05:05:07.190 --> 05:05:07.200 align:start position:0%
taxpayer uh it often you know flusters
 
05:05:09.070 --> 05:05:09.080 align:start position:0%
me to see that we will fly all over the
 
05:05:10.270 --> 05:05:10.280 align:start position:0%
country for some of these serious
 
05:05:11.788 --> 05:05:11.798 align:start position:0%
offenses go through the process of
 
05:05:13.948 --> 05:05:13.958 align:start position:0%
extradition Governor's warrants flying
 
05:05:15.590 --> 05:05:15.600 align:start position:0%
out with multiple deputies to bring them
 
05:05:18.030 --> 05:05:18.040 align:start position:0%
back from Texas California Florida uh in
 
05:05:20.110 --> 05:05:20.120 align:start position:0%
other states and then you know pretty
 
05:05:21.830 --> 05:05:21.840 align:start position:0%
shortly after they're released again on
 
05:05:23.470 --> 05:05:23.480 align:start position:0%
personal recognising bail and we know
 
05:05:24.868 --> 05:05:24.878 align:start position:0%
that they're in the wind so I know
 
05:05:25.990 --> 05:05:26.000 align:start position:0%
you're going hear from some folks with
 
05:05:27.708 --> 05:05:27.718 align:start position:0%
some specific and very egregious stuff
 
05:05:29.510 --> 05:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
but I just really wanted to speak to the
 
05:05:31.190 --> 05:05:31.200 align:start position:0%
some of the specifics that affect the
 
05:05:33.310 --> 05:05:33.320 align:start position:0%
Sheriff's Office and all those judges
 
05:05:35.190 --> 05:05:35.200 align:start position:0%
orders to arrest for violations and
 
05:05:36.670 --> 05:05:36.680 align:start position:0%
failures to appear that are coming out
 
05:05:40.190 --> 05:05:40.200 align:start position:0%
on a very regular basis uh and it it
 
05:05:42.708 --> 05:05:42.718 align:start position:0%
and it it is disheartening to law
 
05:05:44.788 --> 05:05:44.798 align:start position:0%
enforcement in general and as everyone
 
05:05:46.628 --> 05:05:46.638 align:start position:0%
knows we have a national Recruitment and
 
05:05:49.310 --> 05:05:49.320 align:start position:0%
Retention issue as it is uh and the last
 
05:05:52.628 --> 05:05:52.638 align:start position:0%
thing we want to do is uh disenfranchise
 
05:05:54.150 --> 05:05:54.160 align:start position:0%
those motivated law enforcement officers
 
05:05:55.310 --> 05:05:55.320 align:start position:0%
that want to make our communities the
 
05:05:58.390 --> 05:05:58.400 align:start position:0%
safer place to be thank you thank you
 
05:06:00.510 --> 05:06:00.520 align:start position:0%
for sharing that unique perspective with
 
05:06:02.750 --> 05:06:02.760 align:start position:0%
us major um I think I need to talk to
 
05:06:05.628 --> 05:06:05.638 align:start position:0%
you about a budget yes sir we stick
 
05:06:08.390 --> 05:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
around when we're done um the chair
 
05:06:25.150 --> 05:06:25.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:28.310 --> 05:06:28.320 align:start position:0%
aad okay let's see if the mic is right
 
05:06:30.830 --> 05:06:30.840 align:start position:0%
okay um Amanda Zod policy director at
 
05:06:32.230 --> 05:06:32.240 align:start position:0%
the ACLU of New
 
05:06:34.948 --> 05:06:34.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire chairman committee members
 
05:06:37.190 --> 05:06:37.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time um many of you
 
05:06:40.230 --> 05:06:40.240 align:start position:0%
know a great deal about baale and I
 
05:06:42.310 --> 05:06:42.320 align:start position:0%
appreciate your work in this space I
 
05:06:43.990 --> 05:06:44.000 align:start position:0%
have not had time to review the new
 
05:06:45.628 --> 05:06:45.638 align:start position:0%
Amendment and I'm going to try to
 
05:06:47.030 --> 05:06:47.040 align:start position:0%
respect the time of the committee since
 
05:06:49.470 --> 05:06:49.480 align:start position:0%
this is a very busy hearing um so I've
 
05:06:50.830 --> 05:06:50.840 align:start position:0%
cut back a little bit of what I had
 
05:06:51.910 --> 05:06:51.920 align:start position:0%
planned to
 
05:06:54.510 --> 05:06:54.520 align:start position:0%
say but first i' just like to step back
 
05:06:56.868 --> 05:06:56.878 align:start position:0%
for an overview of why the bail process
 
05:07:00.150 --> 05:07:00.160 align:start position:0%
is key to a just Criminal Justice System
 
05:07:01.990 --> 05:07:02.000 align:start position:0%
bail is the process that determines
 
05:07:03.708 --> 05:07:03.718 align:start position:0%
whether someone accused of a crime will
 
05:07:05.948 --> 05:07:05.958 align:start position:0%
be incarcerated before their
 
05:07:08.310 --> 05:07:08.320 align:start position:0%
trial baale is supposed to serve two
 
05:07:10.230 --> 05:07:10.240 align:start position:0%
purposes here in New Hampshire
 
05:07:12.070 --> 05:07:12.080 align:start position:0%
one to ensure that someone accused of a
 
05:07:14.628 --> 05:07:14.638 align:start position:0%
crime will appear in court and two to
 
05:07:16.548 --> 05:07:16.558 align:start position:0%
ensure that people who are a danger to
 
05:07:18.910 --> 05:07:18.920 align:start position:0%
the community are detained even though
 
05:07:21.110 --> 05:07:21.120 align:start position:0%
they have not been convicted of a
 
05:07:24.190 --> 05:07:24.200 align:start position:0%
crime until bail reform in 2018
 
05:07:25.628 --> 05:07:25.638 align:start position:0%
thousands of granite Staters were
 
05:07:27.910 --> 05:07:27.920 align:start position:0%
incarcerated pre-trial each year not
 
05:07:29.110 --> 05:07:29.120 align:start position:0%
because they were a danger to the
 
05:07:30.948 --> 05:07:30.958 align:start position:0%
community but simply because they could
 
05:07:32.590 --> 05:07:32.600 align:start position:0%
not afford to pay their
 
05:07:35.110 --> 05:07:35.120 align:start position:0%
bail if you could afford bail you had a
 
05:07:37.190 --> 05:07:37.200 align:start position:0%
very different experience I just want to
 
05:07:40.030 --> 05:07:40.040 align:start position:0%
reflect on how far we've come
 
05:07:42.070 --> 05:07:42.080 align:start position:0%
study after study shows pre-trial
 
05:07:44.708 --> 05:07:44.718 align:start position:0%
detention increases recidivism rates
 
05:07:46.830 --> 05:07:46.840 align:start position:0%
which means a person is more likely to
 
05:07:49.628 --> 05:07:49.638 align:start position:0%
be arrested for a new crime we do not
 
05:07:52.548 --> 05:07:52.558 align:start position:0%
want that of course pre-trial detention
 
05:07:54.750 --> 05:07:54.760 align:start position:0%
has a host of other issues it makes it
 
05:07:56.948 --> 05:07:56.958 align:start position:0%
more likely that innocent people will
 
05:07:56.958 --> 05:07:58.230 align:start position:0%
more likely that innocent people will
plead

05:07:58.230 --> 05:07:58.240 align:start position:0%
plead
 
05:08:00.628 --> 05:08:00.638 align:start position:0%
guilty people lose their employment
 
05:08:03.590 --> 05:08:03.600 align:start position:0%
their income even their housing people
 
05:08:05.110 --> 05:08:05.120 align:start position:0%
have their Liberty taken from them
 
05:08:07.350 --> 05:08:07.360 align:start position:0%
before the criminal legal process has
 
05:08:07.360 --> 05:08:08.430 align:start position:0%
before the criminal legal process has
even

05:08:08.430 --> 05:08:08.440 align:start position:0%
even
 
05:08:10.948 --> 05:08:10.958 align:start position:0%
begun being detained for any more than a
 
05:08:13.990 --> 05:08:14.000 align:start position:0%
day is a traumatic family
 
05:08:16.830 --> 05:08:16.840 align:start position:0%
disruption so the money bail system the
 
05:08:20.590 --> 05:08:20.600 align:start position:0%
one that HB 592 initially and maybe
 
05:08:22.990 --> 05:08:23.000 align:start position:0%
still hopes to return New Hampshire to
 
05:08:25.190 --> 05:08:25.200 align:start position:0%
is a system that fuels widespread
 
05:08:25.200 --> 05:08:27.270 align:start position:0%
is a system that fuels widespread
wealth-based

05:08:27.270 --> 05:08:27.280 align:start position:0%
wealth-based
 
05:08:29.750 --> 05:08:29.760 align:start position:0%
incarceration for context pre-trial
 
05:08:33.830 --> 05:08:33.840 align:start position:0%
incarceration caused unaffordable bail
 
05:08:36.390 --> 05:08:36.400 align:start position:0%
for the context pre-trial incarceration
 
05:08:38.628 --> 05:08:38.638 align:start position:0%
has caused unaffordable bail as the
 
05:08:40.350 --> 05:08:40.360 align:start position:0%
single great greatest driver of
 
05:08:42.190 --> 05:08:42.200 align:start position:0%
convictions and is responsible for the
 
05:08:45.150 --> 05:08:45.160 align:start position:0%
bloating of our nation's jail and prison
 
05:08:47.788 --> 05:08:47.798 align:start position:0%
populations meanwhile wealthy people as
 
05:08:49.948 --> 05:08:49.958 align:start position:0%
was pointed out earlier accused of the
 
05:08:52.708 --> 05:08:52.718 align:start position:0%
same crime can buy their freedom and
 
05:08:55.548 --> 05:08:55.558 align:start position:0%
return home so with all that said New
 
05:08:57.750 --> 05:08:57.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is better for its work to end
 
05:09:00.070 --> 05:09:00.080 align:start position:0%
wealth-based incarceration bail reform
 
05:09:01.868 --> 05:09:01.878 align:start position:0%
is an important piece making our
 
05:09:04.270 --> 05:09:04.280 align:start position:0%
criminal legal system more about Justice
 
05:09:06.030 --> 05:09:06.040 align:start position:0%
and ensuring each person in New
 
05:09:08.470 --> 05:09:08.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire feels that their Liberty and
 
05:09:10.470 --> 05:09:10.480 align:start position:0%
freedom and legal rights
 
05:09:13.030 --> 05:09:13.040 align:start position:0%
matter needlessly incarcerating people
 
05:09:15.868 --> 05:09:15.878 align:start position:0%
for several days or with high bail not
 
05:09:18.830 --> 05:09:18.840 align:start position:0%
based on ability to pay is detrimental
 
05:09:21.230 --> 05:09:21.240 align:start position:0%
to families communities and cost
 
05:09:24.430 --> 05:09:24.440 align:start position:0%
taxpayers a ton of money merely being
 
05:09:27.548 --> 05:09:27.558 align:start position:0%
arrested is not supposed to result in a
 
05:09:30.230 --> 05:09:30.240 align:start position:0%
person being incarcerated with limited
 
05:09:32.990 --> 05:09:33.000 align:start position:0%
exceptions such as they are a danger to
 
05:09:35.868 --> 05:09:35.878 align:start position:0%
our community our current process in New
 
05:09:39.948 --> 05:09:39.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has that exact piece included
 
05:09:42.788 --> 05:09:42.798 align:start position:0%
under our current system we are in a
 
05:09:46.390 --> 05:09:46.400 align:start position:0%
good place HB 592 we are stepping far
 
05:09:47.948 --> 05:09:47.958 align:start position:0%
back into the past and throwing out a
 
05:09:49.708 --> 05:09:49.718 align:start position:0%
lot of good that's been done
 
05:09:52.150 --> 05:09:52.160 align:start position:0%
here I also want to acknowledge the work
 
05:09:55.030 --> 05:09:55.040 align:start position:0%
done by this committee progress on bail
 
05:09:58.030 --> 05:09:58.040 align:start position:0%
last year was the result of years of
 
05:10:01.830 --> 05:10:01.840 align:start position:0%
work by this group of people it was
 
05:10:04.430 --> 05:10:04.440 align:start position:0%
months of bipartisan
 
05:10:07.628 --> 05:10:07.638 align:start position:0%
negotiations and a bipartisan result
 
05:10:09.430 --> 05:10:09.440 align:start position:0%
there were work sessions there there
 
05:10:12.270 --> 05:10:12.280 align:start position:0%
were field trips there was stakeholder
 
05:10:15.310 --> 05:10:15.320 align:start position:0%
buyin there was genuine real input from
 
05:10:18.390 --> 05:10:18.400 align:start position:0%
law enforcement from courts from
 
05:10:21.868 --> 05:10:21.878 align:start position:0%
stakeholders it was a very serious
 
05:10:24.230 --> 05:10:24.240 align:start position:0%
process now we're only seven or eight
 
05:10:26.310 --> 05:10:26.320 align:start position:0%
months out of Committee of conference
 
05:10:28.110 --> 05:10:28.120 align:start position:0%
we're only 6 months from the governor
 
05:10:30.910 --> 05:10:30.920 align:start position:0%
signing it and we're less than a month
 
05:10:32.590 --> 05:10:32.600 align:start position:0%
from fully being
 
05:10:34.430 --> 05:10:34.440 align:start position:0%
enacted and we're having this
 
05:10:36.190 --> 05:10:36.200 align:start position:0%
conversation about potentially cutting
 
05:10:41.548 --> 05:10:41.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:43.070 --> 05:10:43.080 align:start position:0%
we need to let the new changes take
 
05:10:45.150 --> 05:10:45.160 align:start position:0%
effect we need to let the magistrates
 
05:10:47.270 --> 05:10:47.280 align:start position:0%
who have a five-year term do the work
 
05:10:50.150 --> 05:10:50.160 align:start position:0%
that the legislators ask them to do and
 
05:10:52.510 --> 05:10:52.520 align:start position:0%
I just want to remind everyone that the
 
05:10:55.470 --> 05:10:55.480 align:start position:0%
magistrates is a cost-saving system as
 
05:10:58.150 --> 05:10:58.160 align:start position:0%
well saving money by not incarcerating
 
05:11:00.750 --> 05:11:00.760 align:start position:0%
people in jails for several days or more
 
05:11:03.548 --> 05:11:03.558 align:start position:0%
that adds up very quickly but also as
 
05:11:05.990 --> 05:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier magistrates are paid
 
05:11:08.030 --> 05:11:08.040 align:start position:0%
less than judges so if you're going to
 
05:11:09.310 --> 05:11:09.320 align:start position:0%
get rid of them you're going to have
 
05:11:14.350 --> 05:11:14.360 align:start position:0%
have judges doing the work at a higher
 
05:11:16.868 --> 05:11:16.878 align:start position:0%
cost anyone who's a danger to the
 
05:11:19.830 --> 05:11:19.840 align:start position:0%
community can be held currently if folks
 
05:11:21.670 --> 05:11:21.680 align:start position:0%
violate a term of their release there
 
05:11:24.350 --> 05:11:24.360 align:start position:0%
are options to hold them and decisions
 
05:11:26.070 --> 05:11:26.080 align:start position:0%
around bail may be appealed by both
 
05:11:29.430 --> 05:11:29.440 align:start position:0%
sides the system works so if it could
 
05:11:32.230 --> 05:11:32.240 align:start position:0%
have more than a month to operate that
 
05:11:33.628 --> 05:11:33.638 align:start position:0%
would be
 
05:11:37.670 --> 05:11:37.680 align:start position:0%
best and lastly I just want to Let's
 
05:11:38.868 --> 05:11:38.878 align:start position:0%
appreciate that New Hampshire is
 
05:11:41.390 --> 05:11:41.400 align:start position:0%
incredible inedibly safe it is known as
 
05:11:43.070 --> 05:11:43.080 align:start position:0%
one of the St safest states in the
 
05:11:43.080 --> 05:11:44.390 align:start position:0%
one of the St safest states in the
country

05:11:44.390 --> 05:11:44.400 align:start position:0%
country
 
05:11:47.190 --> 05:11:47.200 align:start position:0%
repeatedly across the board according to
 
05:11:49.430 --> 05:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
the Department of safety's website crime
 
05:11:52.150 --> 05:11:52.160 align:start position:0%
was down from 2023 to
 
05:11:54.948 --> 05:11:54.958 align:start position:0%
2024 so there is I want to be clear
 
05:11:57.470 --> 05:11:57.480 align:start position:0%
there is no wave of crime that has
 
05:11:59.990 --> 05:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
overtaken the state that merits tearing
 
05:12:02.708 --> 05:12:02.718 align:start position:0%
up a brand new bipartisan deal on
 
05:12:05.310 --> 05:12:05.320 align:start position:0%
bail in fact since bail reform has been
 
05:12:07.310 --> 05:12:07.320 align:start position:0%
enacted over the years New Hampshire
 
05:12:09.510 --> 05:12:09.520 align:start position:0%
continues to get safer looking at the
 
05:12:11.990 --> 05:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
data all the way back to 2018 the first
 
05:12:14.310 --> 05:12:14.320 align:start position:0%
year of bail reform crime has continued
 
05:12:14.320 --> 05:12:14.990 align:start position:0%
year of bail reform crime has continued
to

05:12:14.990 --> 05:12:15.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:12:17.628 --> 05:12:17.638 align:start position:0%
drop we are continuously ranked as one
 
05:12:19.390 --> 05:12:19.400 align:start position:0%
of the safest states in the country and
 
05:12:22.150 --> 05:12:22.160 align:start position:0%
do not need to rip out bipartisan
 
05:12:24.310 --> 05:12:24.320 align:start position:0%
criminal legal reform efforts out of our
 
05:12:26.310 --> 05:12:26.320 align:start position:0%
laws and go
 
05:12:29.670 --> 05:12:29.680 align:start position:0%
backwards bail reform has made our state
 
05:12:31.868 --> 05:12:31.878 align:start position:0%
better over the years please don't go
 
05:12:35.310 --> 05:12:35.320 align:start position:0%
backwards thank you for your
 
05:12:41.230 --> 05:12:41.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:55.830 --> 05:12:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:58.310 --> 05:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
Sullivan good afternoon chairman Roy and
 
05:13:00.230 --> 05:13:00.240 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is
 
05:13:01.948 --> 05:13:01.958 align:start position:0%
Patrick Sullivan I'm the executive
 
05:13:03.070 --> 05:13:03.080 align:start position:0%
director of the New Hampshire
 
05:13:05.190 --> 05:13:05.200 align:start position:0%
Association of chiefs of police I've
 
05:13:06.948 --> 05:13:06.958 align:start position:0%
been actively involved and currently
 
05:13:09.110 --> 05:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
serve in law enforcement for the past 43
 
05:13:12.110 --> 05:13:12.120 align:start position:0%
3 years I retired as the police chief in
 
05:13:17.150 --> 05:13:17.160 align:start position:0%
gtown I am here today to support HP 592
 
05:13:19.470 --> 05:13:19.480 align:start position:0%
and its Amendment and for the New
 
05:13:21.230 --> 05:13:21.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Association of chiefs police
 
05:13:22.510 --> 05:13:22.520 align:start position:0%
for the most part this amendment
 
05:13:25.430 --> 05:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
restores the statute to the bail back
 
05:13:27.150 --> 05:13:27.160 align:start position:0%
prior to
 
05:13:30.590 --> 05:13:30.600 align:start position:0%
2018 the purpose of bail has been a
 
05:13:32.310 --> 05:13:32.320 align:start position:0%
legal process to allow the defendant to
 
05:13:34.150 --> 05:13:34.160 align:start position:0%
be released from jail while awaiting
 
05:13:36.708 --> 05:13:36.718 align:start position:0%
trial the other purpose of bail is to
 
05:13:38.150 --> 05:13:38.160 align:start position:0%
ensure that the defendant appears in
 
05:13:39.750 --> 05:13:39.760 align:start position:0%
court and does not
 
05:13:43.310 --> 05:13:43.320 align:start position:0%
po uh POS a danger to the community
 
05:13:44.948 --> 05:13:44.958 align:start position:0%
since the legislature made sweeping
 
05:13:48.430 --> 05:13:48.440 align:start position:0%
changes to bail reform in 2018 signed by
 
05:13:50.990 --> 05:13:51.000 align:start position:0%
the governor in 2018 there has been a
 
05:13:52.990 --> 05:13:53.000 align:start position:0%
considerable frustration by all of law
 
05:13:54.910 --> 05:13:54.920 align:start position:0%
enforcement about those who are not
 
05:13:56.830 --> 05:13:56.840 align:start position:0%
being held who are a danger to the
 
05:13:58.788 --> 05:13:58.798 align:start position:0%
public and the
 
05:14:02.868 --> 05:14:02.878 align:start position:0%
community while well intended SB 556
 
05:14:05.868 --> 05:14:05.878 align:start position:0%
went too far since 2018 there have been
 
05:14:08.310 --> 05:14:08.320 align:start position:0%
many examples of how bail reform has not
 
05:14:11.030 --> 05:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
worked and several changes made to
 
05:14:12.910 --> 05:14:12.920 align:start position:0%
attempt to correct that
 
05:14:15.230 --> 05:14:15.240 align:start position:0%
statute the New Hampshire Association of
 
05:14:17.150 --> 05:14:17.160 align:start position:0%
CH police appreciate the governor
 
05:14:19.070 --> 05:14:19.080 align:start position:0%
bringing this bill forward and we look
 
05:14:21.390 --> 05:14:21.400 align:start position:0%
forward to working with the committee on
 
05:14:21.400 --> 05:14:22.990 align:start position:0%
forward to working with the committee on
this

05:14:22.990 --> 05:14:23.000 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:14:28.628 --> 05:14:28.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:42.590 --> 05:14:42.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:44.190 --> 05:14:44.200 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chair and committee
 
05:14:46.070 --> 05:14:46.080 align:start position:0%
members my name is Chad Lavoy I'm a
 
05:14:48.070 --> 05:14:48.080 align:start position:0%
major with the state police and I'm
 
05:14:49.910 --> 05:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
representing the department of safety uh
 
05:14:51.510 --> 05:14:51.520 align:start position:0%
from New Hampshire and the state police
 
05:14:54.390 --> 05:14:54.400 align:start position:0%
as well and I'm here to offer testimony
 
05:14:55.990 --> 05:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
and support of this bill and I'm not
 
05:14:57.350 --> 05:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
going to repeat what my colleagues have
 
05:14:59.030 --> 05:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
to say but I'll make it brief on where
 
05:15:01.590 --> 05:15:01.600 align:start position:0%
we stand as an agency this change
 
05:15:03.230 --> 05:15:03.240 align:start position:0%
simplifies as the bail process and
 
05:15:05.350 --> 05:15:05.360 align:start position:0%
brings it back to where it was prior to
 
05:15:07.628 --> 05:15:07.638 align:start position:0%
2018 our bail Commissioners are well
 
05:15:09.948 --> 05:15:09.958 align:start position:0%
educated and experienced in the process
 
05:15:11.390 --> 05:15:11.400 align:start position:0%
of representing the courts while
 
05:15:13.990 --> 05:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
determining amount of bail our agency
 
05:15:15.190 --> 05:15:15.200 align:start position:0%
has trust and confidence in their
 
05:15:17.470 --> 05:15:17.480 align:start position:0%
ability to properly determine that bail
 
05:15:19.150 --> 05:15:19.160 align:start position:0%
when they look at a multiple uh
 
05:15:21.070 --> 05:15:21.080 align:start position:0%
different uh reasons whether that's
 
05:15:23.510 --> 05:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
based on the level of crimes the history
 
05:15:26.150 --> 05:15:26.160 align:start position:0%
with the defendant failure to
 
05:15:28.788 --> 05:15:28.798 align:start position:0%
appears criminal history are they out on
 
05:15:31.150 --> 05:15:31.160 align:start position:0%
bail right now and most importantly are
 
05:15:32.548 --> 05:15:32.558 align:start position:0%
they a threat to themselves and to
 
05:15:34.070 --> 05:15:34.080 align:start position:0%
Public Safety
 
05:15:36.708 --> 05:15:36.718 align:start position:0%
overall this amendment will save us time
 
05:15:39.350 --> 05:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
resources and money as an agency uh
 
05:15:41.190 --> 05:15:41.200 align:start position:0%
already stretched thin our important
 
05:15:43.110 --> 05:15:43.120 align:start position:0%
Focus right now is Public Safety and
 
05:15:44.470 --> 05:15:44.480 align:start position:0%
being out there in a proactive
 
05:15:47.230 --> 05:15:47.240 align:start position:0%
enforcement measure as a state agency we
 
05:15:49.628 --> 05:15:49.638 align:start position:0%
cover multiple different courts in all
 
05:15:51.990 --> 05:15:52.000 align:start position:0%
of our troop stations we have a process
 
05:15:53.670 --> 05:15:53.680 align:start position:0%
with our prosecutors and our court
 
05:15:55.708 --> 05:15:55.718 align:start position:0%
support staff and a trooper in each
 
05:15:58.470 --> 05:15:58.480 align:start position:0%
troop that's designated to those courts
 
05:15:59.990 --> 05:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
they work during the week Monday through
 
05:16:02.030 --> 05:16:02.040 align:start position:0%
Friday as well with our prosecution
 
05:16:03.628 --> 05:16:03.638 align:start position:0%
staff when there is something on the
 
05:16:05.070 --> 05:16:05.080 align:start position:0%
weekend that needs to be done if a
 
05:16:07.030 --> 05:16:07.040 align:start position:0%
defendant has a hearing on the weekend
 
05:16:08.910 --> 05:16:08.920 align:start position:0%
now the way it's set up it's very t
 
05:16:11.070 --> 05:16:11.080 align:start position:0%
taxing on us with resources getting
 
05:16:12.868 --> 05:16:12.878 align:start position:0%
those reports if it's from a different
 
05:16:15.150 --> 05:16:15.160 align:start position:0%
shift reviewing those reports and then
 
05:16:16.868 --> 05:16:16.878 align:start position:0%
having that hearing during a designated
 
05:16:19.390 --> 05:16:19.400 align:start position:0%
time is very taxing on our agency when
 
05:16:21.750 --> 05:16:21.760 align:start position:0%
we like to best utilize our resources
 
05:16:24.310 --> 05:16:24.320 align:start position:0%
out in the public view in the public eye
 
05:16:27.430 --> 05:16:27.440 align:start position:0%
enforcing the laws of the state our goal
 
05:16:29.270 --> 05:16:29.280 align:start position:0%
is to ensure that uh bail is appropriate
 
05:16:30.868 --> 05:16:30.878 align:start position:0%
being set by the bail Commissioners and
 
05:16:33.030 --> 05:16:33.040 align:start position:0%
the courts in a consistent and effective
 
05:16:34.990 --> 05:16:35.000 align:start position:0%
manner to ensure that those that are
 
05:16:37.270 --> 05:16:37.280 align:start position:0%
danger to themselves Us in law
 
05:16:42.030 --> 05:16:42.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:44.110 --> 05:16:44.120 align:start position:0%
accountable again our main focus is
 
05:16:45.548 --> 05:16:45.558 align:start position:0%
Public Safety and it's for these reasons
 
05:16:46.910 --> 05:16:46.920 align:start position:0%
and several that will be stated by my
 
05:16:48.310 --> 05:16:48.320 align:start position:0%
colleagues today that we're in support
 
05:16:49.510 --> 05:16:49.520 align:start position:0%
of this
 
05:16:52.868 --> 05:16:52.878 align:start position:0%
amendment thank you major if I may ask
 
05:16:55.788 --> 05:16:55.798 align:start position:0%

information system stand right now as
 
05:17:01.788 --> 05:17:01.798 align:start position:0%
far as um bail as knowing who's on bail
 
05:17:03.430 --> 05:17:03.440 align:start position:0%
we allocated a significant amount of
 
05:17:05.670 --> 05:17:05.680 align:start position:0%
money to that last year and I went to
 
05:17:07.190 --> 05:17:07.200 align:start position:0%
every hearing to make sure that it
 
05:17:09.230 --> 05:17:09.240 align:start position:0%
stayed in there um can you tell me where
 
05:17:11.070 --> 05:17:11.080 align:start position:0%

executive session on House Bill 75 and I

recognize representative rhods to make a
 
05:35:44.830 --> 05:35:44.840 align:start position:0%
motion thank you Mr chairman I move itl
 
05:35:47.670 --> 05:35:47.680 align:start position:0%
for House Bill 75 I'll second that
 
05:35:49.830 --> 05:35:49.840 align:start position:0%
motion thank you would you like to speak
 
05:35:52.670 --> 05:35:52.680 align:start position:0%
to your motion sure
 
05:35:55.190 --> 05:35:55.200 align:start position:0%
um unfortunately the sponsor was not
 
05:35:58.548 --> 05:35:58.558 align:start position:0%
able to come testify on this bill and
 
05:36:00.390 --> 05:36:00.400 align:start position:0%
our understanding is
 
05:36:03.350 --> 05:36:03.360 align:start position:0%
is like usual we have several uh
 
05:36:05.788 --> 05:36:05.798 align:start position:0%
cannabis bills coming towards us coming
 
05:36:08.548 --> 05:36:08.558 align:start position:0%
towards us this session and our hopes is
 
05:36:10.310 --> 05:36:10.320 align:start position:0%
maybe one of those May address what this
 
05:36:11.590 --> 05:36:11.600 align:start position:0%
situation is or maybe they're going to
 
05:36:13.070 --> 05:36:13.080 align:start position:0%
put this particular language with one of
 
05:36:13.948 --> 05:36:13.958 align:start position:0%
those other
 
05:36:15.868 --> 05:36:15.878 align:start position:0%
bills thank you would you like to speak
 
05:36:17.310 --> 05:36:17.320 align:start position:0%
to your second representative Pro no
 
05:36:19.750 --> 05:36:19.760 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you I would just say
 
05:36:22.150 --> 05:36:22.160 align:start position:0%
that um it is true there are a matter of
 
05:36:23.750 --> 05:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
fact we have a couple more Canabis
 
05:36:27.590 --> 05:36:27.600 align:start position:0%
related bills um and I don't think that
 
05:36:30.270 --> 05:36:30.280 align:start position:0%
it is um that high on either party's
 
05:36:33.110 --> 05:36:33.120 align:start position:0%
priority list this year so I don't see
 
05:36:35.110 --> 05:36:35.120 align:start position:0%
us spending a lot of time on that and as
 
05:36:37.628 --> 05:36:37.638 align:start position:0%
I said the prime sponsor he may have
 
05:36:39.548 --> 05:36:39.558 align:start position:0%
been traveling I'm not sure but someone
 
05:36:41.430 --> 05:36:41.440 align:start position:0%
on the list could have come and no one
 
05:36:45.270 --> 05:36:45.280 align:start position:0%
did so we give what we get um any other
 
05:36:47.230 --> 05:36:47.240 align:start position:0%
comments or questions or discussion yes
 
05:36:49.788 --> 05:36:49.798 align:start position:0%
represent Murray thank you Mr chair um I
 
05:36:52.030 --> 05:36:52.040 align:start position:0%
will be voting for this today because I
 
05:36:54.548 --> 05:36:54.558 align:start position:0%
always vote for expansion of cannabis in
 
05:36:56.470 --> 05:36:56.480 align:start position:0%
the state and I do believe it should be
 
05:36:57.948 --> 05:36:57.958 align:start position:0%
legalized and that we should have home
 
05:36:59.910 --> 05:36:59.920 align:start position:0%
grow and hopefully we will see something
 
05:37:01.310 --> 05:37:01.320 align:start position:0%
come out of the state house whatever it
 
05:37:04.310 --> 05:37:04.320 align:start position:0%

one 91
 
05:38:46.628 --> 05:38:46.638 align:start position:0%
91 that was a correct motion I believe
 
05:38:47.990 --> 05:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
not not
 
05:38:52.468 --> 05:38:52.478 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:56.868 --> 05:38:56.878 align:start position:0%
911 second okay second okay motion was
 
05:38:58.350 --> 05:38:58.360 align:start position:0%
seconded by representative pette would
 
05:38:59.708 --> 05:38:59.718 align:start position:0%
you like to speak to your motion
 
05:39:01.788 --> 05:39:01.798 align:start position:0%
Representative no I think it's pretty
 
05:39:05.070 --> 05:39:05.080 align:start position:0%
simple it's just uh removing I I guess I
 
05:39:08.030 --> 05:39:08.040 align:start position:0%
will talk it's just removing uh
 
05:39:10.628 --> 05:39:10.638 align:start position:0%
the necessity for a fire department
 
05:39:13.110 --> 05:39:13.120 align:start position:0%
detail to be there from the moment the
 
05:39:15.590 --> 05:39:15.600 align:start position:0%
truck arrives with the fireworks until
 
05:39:19.990 --> 05:39:20.000 align:start position:0%
they are all gone off and and put out um
 
05:39:22.190 --> 05:39:22.200 align:start position:0%
it gives discretion to the fire
 
05:39:24.830 --> 05:39:24.840 align:start position:0%
department which when they believe they
 
05:39:28.548 --> 05:39:28.558 align:start position:0%
need to be there and only
 
05:39:30.590 --> 05:39:30.600 align:start position:0%
that thank you representative
 
05:39:31.670 --> 05:39:31.680 align:start position:0%
representative pette would you like to
 
05:39:34.830 --> 05:39:34.840 align:start position:0%
speak to you a second no thank you uh I
 
05:39:36.030 --> 05:39:36.040 align:start position:0%
would just add that this is a
 
05:39:38.270 --> 05:39:38.280 align:start position:0%
cost-saving measure from alties who pay
 
05:39:41.750 --> 05:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
for these um fire firemen to stand by um
 
05:39:43.390 --> 05:39:43.400 align:start position:0%
sometimes overnight while fireworks on
 
05:39:46.310 --> 05:39:46.320 align:start position:0%
the ground waiting to be lit um I think
 
05:39:48.270 --> 05:39:48.280 align:start position:0%
that if I'm not mistaken the fire
 
05:39:49.750 --> 05:39:49.760 align:start position:0%
departments themselves have supported
 
05:39:52.070 --> 05:39:52.080 align:start position:0%
and asked for this bill is that correct
 
05:39:54.948 --> 05:39:54.958 align:start position:0%
I believe so yeah so that's where that's
 
05:39:57.110 --> 05:39:57.120 align:start position:0%
at any further
 
05:39:59.310 --> 05:39:59.320 align:start position:0%

pacquette would you like to speak to
 
05:41:07.510 --> 05:41:07.520 align:start position:0%
your motion uh Yep this bill uh Works to
 
05:41:11.548 --> 05:41:11.558 align:start position:0%
to uh remove the unfunded Mandate of
 
05:41:14.590 --> 05:41:14.600 align:start position:0%
paying overtime when the call happens
 
05:41:16.990 --> 05:41:17.000 align:start position:0%
close to the end of their shift which is
 
05:41:20.708 --> 05:41:20.718 align:start position:0%
a rare occasion uh and this will
 
05:41:23.830 --> 05:41:23.840 align:start position:0%
probably be just used for routine calls
 
05:41:25.270 --> 05:41:25.280 align:start position:0%
any significant
 
05:41:29.270 --> 05:41:29.280 align:start position:0%
call it they get done automatically uh
 
05:41:31.910 --> 05:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
within 24 hours or even before they
 
05:41:34.990 --> 05:41:35.000 align:start position:0%
leave so we'll still pay overtime for
 
05:41:39.070 --> 05:41:39.080 align:start position:0%
those uh but it just uh a cost saving
 
05:41:41.708 --> 05:41:41.718 align:start position:0%
measures on on the routine
 
05:41:43.590 --> 05:41:43.600 align:start position:0%
calls thank you representative would you
 
05:41:44.430 --> 05:41:44.440 align:start position:0%
like to speak to your second
 
05:41:46.990 --> 05:41:47.000 align:start position:0%
Representative pqu no I agree with what
 
05:41:50.990 --> 05:41:51.000 align:start position:0%
he said thank you representative Pro um
 
05:41:52.548 --> 05:41:52.558 align:start position:0%
to the best of your knowledge was the
 
05:41:54.150 --> 05:41:54.160 align:start position:0%
department or the State Fire Marshals
 
05:41:55.750 --> 05:41:55.760 align:start position:0%
were they notified of this
 
05:41:59.110 --> 05:41:59.120 align:start position:0%
bill uh yes they knew about it and did
 
05:42:00.948 --> 05:42:00.958 align:start position:0%
anyone come or notify you that they were
 
05:42:02.150 --> 05:42:02.160 align:start position:0%
against the
 
05:42:05.070 --> 05:42:05.080 align:start position:0%
bill they said they weren't happy with
 
05:42:09.230 --> 05:42:09.240 align:start position:0%
it but apparently not enough to show
 
05:42:09.240 --> 05:42:11.030 align:start position:0%
it but apparently not enough to show
up

05:42:11.030 --> 05:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
up
 
05:42:15.548 --> 05:42:15.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:18.190 --> 05:42:18.200 align:start position:0%
yeah no he had discussed an amendment
 
05:42:20.590 --> 05:42:20.600 align:start position:0%
but I think he just decided didn't need
 
05:42:24.510 --> 05:42:24.520 align:start position:0%
it um it wasn't a wasn't a key amendment
 
05:42:26.868 --> 05:42:26.878 align:start position:0%
I don't believe I think that there
 
05:42:30.830 --> 05:42:30.840 align:start position:0%
saving something for possible use in the
 
05:42:35.430 --> 05:42:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:38.868 --> 05:42:38.878 align:start position:0%
politics yes
 
05:42:40.548 --> 05:42:40.558 align:start position:0%
um I think the department of safety did
 
05:42:43.910 --> 05:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
submit online testimony yeah
 
05:42:48.948 --> 05:42:48.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:53.430 --> 05:42:53.440 align:start position:0%

[Music]
 
05:43:07.468 --> 05:43:07.478 align:start position:0%
says that the national trend for many
 
05:43:10.110 --> 05:43:10.120 align:start position:0%
states is now requiring EMS records to
 
05:43:12.230 --> 05:43:12.240 align:start position:0%
be submitted to the states within 24
 
05:43:15.190 --> 05:43:15.200 align:start position:0%

50% of them had a 24-hour or less
 
05:43:27.510 --> 05:43:27.520 align:start position:0%
requirement of the New England states um
 
05:43:29.830 --> 05:43:29.840 align:start position:0%
four out of five required 24 hours or
 
05:43:32.948 --> 05:43:32.958 align:start position:0%
less um in addition New York require

department of safety fire
 
05:44:48.590 --> 05:44:48.600 align:start position:0%
safety uh that's nice that they have uh
 
05:44:50.948 --> 05:44:50.958 align:start position:0%
they want 24 hours but unless they're
 
05:44:52.110 --> 05:44:52.120 align:start position:0%
paying my
 
05:44:55.390 --> 05:44:55.400 align:start position:0%
overtime that's an unfunded mandate and
 
05:44:58.350 --> 05:44:58.360 align:start position:0%
uh I don't believe we support those
 
05:44:58.360 --> 05:44:59.468 align:start position:0%
uh I don't believe we support those
thank

05:44:59.468 --> 05:44:59.478 align:start position:0%
thank
 
05:45:03.350 --> 05:45:03.360 align:start position:0%
you um see no further discussion go
 
05:45:06.430 --> 05:45:06.440 align:start position:0%
ahead raise your hand I don't think I
 
05:45:08.590 --> 05:45:08.600 align:start position:0%
can support with this um when we had the
 
05:45:11.310 --> 05:45:11.320 align:start position:0%
conversation um I believe at the time
 
05:45:13.708 --> 05:45:13.718 align:start position:0%
that we that there was supposed to be an
 
05:45:16.190 --> 05:45:16.200 align:start position:0%
amendment that's basically said that if
 
05:45:19.190 --> 05:45:19.200 align:start position:0%
it was a delta or Echo it had to be done
 
05:45:21.430 --> 05:45:21.440 align:start position:0%
immediately you couldn't wait the 24
 
05:45:24.270 --> 05:45:24.280 align:start position:0%
hours we even talked about
 
05:45:28.868 --> 05:45:28.878 align:start position:0%
um if letting the supervisor um make a
 
05:45:32.948 --> 05:45:32.958 align:start position:0%
decision on some of those calls but I
 
05:45:34.788 --> 05:45:34.798 align:start position:0%
know that I asked for 5 days versus
 
05:45:37.548 --> 05:45:37.558 align:start position:0%
seven days but on the same token
 
05:45:40.830 --> 05:45:40.840 align:start position:0%
if it's echo or Delta then it should be
 
05:45:43.270 --> 05:45:43.280 align:start position:0%
24 hours and I thought we were going to
 
05:45:45.548 --> 05:45:45.558 align:start position:0%
see an amendment that basically said
 
05:45:49.070 --> 05:45:49.080 align:start position:0%
just that you like
 
05:45:51.510 --> 05:45:51.520 align:start position:0%
the with such an amendment would you
 
05:45:54.750 --> 05:45:54.760 align:start position:0%
support yeah we we said that
 
05:45:57.070 --> 05:45:57.080 align:start position:0%
before um let me see how would we do
 
05:46:00.070 --> 05:46:00.080 align:start position:0%
this logistically Nancy just so you know
 
05:46:01.708 --> 05:46:01.718 align:start position:0%
my thought was I was going to leave it
 
05:46:04.830 --> 05:46:04.840 align:start position:0%
this way so that when it got to the
 
05:46:06.910 --> 05:46:06.920 align:start position:0%
Senate and the state finally showed
 
05:46:10.070 --> 05:46:10.080 align:start position:0%
showed up and was gaming and hollering I
 
05:46:11.628 --> 05:46:11.638 align:start position:0%
would have some bargain
 
05:46:13.910 --> 05:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
chips so that's why I was leaving it
 
05:46:17.430 --> 05:46:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:17.440 --> 05:46:19.548 align:start position:0%
 
but

05:46:19.548 --> 05:46:19.558 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:46:23.350 --> 05:46:23.360 align:start position:0%
what yeah you can hold on to it we we
 
05:46:25.990 --> 05:46:26.000 align:start position:0%
we'll carry it
 
05:46:28.230 --> 05:46:28.240 align:start position:0%
to I think I'm going to do that because
 
05:46:29.948 --> 05:46:29.958 align:start position:0%
I'm pretty sure eventually the state
 
05:46:32.788 --> 05:46:32.798 align:start position:0%
will show up the thing I
 
05:46:36.070 --> 05:46:36.080 align:start position:0%
that gives me no motivation sure they
 
05:46:38.110 --> 05:46:38.120 align:start position:0%
did online testimony but they couldn't
 
05:46:40.110 --> 05:46:40.120 align:start position:0%
be bothered to show up so obviously it's
 
05:46:43.230 --> 05:46:43.240 align:start position:0%
not that important to them so that's the
 
05:46:45.070 --> 05:46:45.080 align:start position:0%
way I see
 
05:46:49.150 --> 05:46:49.160 align:start position:0%
that yeah thank you um I'm not sure why
 
05:46:50.628 --> 05:46:50.638 align:start position:0%
they didn't show up it would have been
 
05:46:51.868 --> 05:46:51.878 align:start position:0%
nice to see them here and have their
 
05:46:54.310 --> 05:46:54.320 align:start position:0%
input but they clearly stated and shared
 
05:46:55.990 --> 05:46:56.000 align:start position:0%
some information regarding other states
 
05:46:58.590 --> 05:46:58.600 align:start position:0%
as well um I know I had raised the issue
 
05:47:00.030 --> 05:47:00.040 align:start position:0%
of I thought it would be important to
 
05:47:02.150 --> 05:47:02.160 align:start position:0%
have at least the Delta and Echo calls
 
05:47:04.868 --> 05:47:04.878 align:start position:0%
done routinely I'm going to tell you
 
05:47:07.310 --> 05:47:07.320 align:start position:0%
that happens without us doing that yes
 
05:47:09.990 --> 05:47:10.000 align:start position:0%
but but should we change it we're saying
 
05:47:11.868 --> 05:47:11.878 align:start position:0%
they don't they no longer have to be and
 
05:47:14.070 --> 05:47:14.080 align:start position:0%
anybody that could choose for whatever
 
05:47:16.030 --> 05:47:16.040 align:start position:0%
reason not to they' say look it there's
 
05:47:18.270 --> 05:47:18.280 align:start position:0%
legislation I don't have to so I I get
 
05:47:19.990 --> 05:47:20.000 align:start position:0%
it and I think most people doing their
 
05:47:23.070 --> 05:47:23.080 align:start position:0%
job are going to do the right thing um
 
05:47:25.948 --> 05:47:25.958 align:start position:0%
so I would not have objected to the bill
 
05:47:28.830 --> 05:47:28.840 align:start position:0%
if we you know it was Delta and Echo
 
05:47:31.390 --> 05:47:31.400 align:start position:0%
calls were done within 24 hours and the
 
05:47:33.510 --> 05:47:33.520 align:start position:0%
other the remainder were maybe at the
 
05:47:36.510 --> 05:47:36.520 align:start position:0%
discretion of the supervisor but I can I
 
05:47:39.270 --> 05:47:39.280 align:start position:0%
I don't think a good support I get the
 
05:47:41.150 --> 05:47:41.160 align:start position:0%
overtime savings but I think that's
 
05:47:44.510 --> 05:47:44.520 align:start position:0%
something that management can can figure
 
05:47:48.430 --> 05:47:48.440 align:start position:0%
and I it sort of bothers me to legislate
 
05:47:50.788 --> 05:47:50.798 align:start position:0%
like policy and procedures within a
 
05:47:53.708 --> 05:47:53.718 align:start position:0%
department when they're when the input
 
05:47:55.030 --> 05:47:55.040 align:start position:0%
that they've
 
05:47:58.150 --> 05:47:58.160 align:start position:0%
provided is consistent with other states
 
05:48:01.548 --> 05:48:01.558 align:start position:0%
and this bill really isn't so just my
 
05:48:03.670 --> 05:48:03.680 align:start position:0%
thoughts thank you so when it comes back
 
05:48:05.270 --> 05:48:05.280 align:start position:0%
from the Senate and that amendment is on
 
05:48:07.510 --> 05:48:07.520 align:start position:0%
it then you'll be supporting it right oh
 
05:48:09.230 --> 05:48:09.240 align:start position:0%
there we go see everything works out
 
05:48:11.628 --> 05:48:11.638 align:start position:0%
representative uh sherff I I was I was
 
05:48:13.070 --> 05:48:13.080 align:start position:0%
thinking maybe we could do the Delta
 
05:48:15.590 --> 05:48:15.600 align:start position:0%
Echo Amendment here and save the five
 
05:48:18.030 --> 05:48:18.040 align:start position:0%
days for what happens in the Senate just
 
05:48:20.230 --> 05:48:20.240 align:start position:0%
as a you know it save a little bit of a
 
05:48:25.430 --> 05:48:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:28.430 --> 05:48:28.440 align:start position:0%
oll I'm going to
 
05:48:31.030 --> 05:48:31.040 align:start position:0%

05:49:47.628 --> 05:49:47.638 align:start position:0%
session on House Bill
 
05:49:49.788 --> 05:49:49.798 align:start position:0%

recognize representative samon D sh
 
05:49:55.750 --> 05:49:55.760 align:start position:0%
motion to
 
05:49:55.760 --> 05:49:57.310 align:start position:0%
motion to
retain

05:49:57.310 --> 05:49:57.320 align:start position:0%
retain
 
05:49:59.788 --> 05:49:59.798 align:start position:0%
second motion to retain made by the
 
05:49:59.798 --> 05:50:01.190 align:start position:0%
second motion to retain made by the
representative

05:50:01.190 --> 05:50:01.200 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:50:04.628 --> 05:50:04.638 align:start position:0%
Shon and seconded
 
05:50:08.230 --> 05:50:08.240 align:start position:0%
by representative um roads would you
 
05:50:09.150 --> 05:50:09.160 align:start position:0%
like to speak to your motion
 
05:50:11.070 --> 05:50:11.080 align:start position:0%
representative yes I don't believe that
 
05:50:12.590 --> 05:50:12.600 align:start position:0%
this legislation will
 
05:50:14.948 --> 05:50:14.958 align:start position:0%
actually help reduce the sanal bacteria
 
05:50:16.430 --> 05:50:16.440 align:start position:0%
plumes and I think that we're just
 
05:50:18.830 --> 05:50:18.840 align:start position:0%
expanding basically state power into
 
05:50:20.310 --> 05:50:20.320 align:start position:0%
people's properties I don't think that
 
05:50:21.830 --> 05:50:21.840 align:start position:0%
this is actually going to get where
 
05:50:24.390 --> 05:50:24.400 align:start position:0%
we're trying to go with it so wants to
 
05:50:25.990 --> 05:50:26.000 align:start position:0%
solve one problem it's a punitive
 
05:50:27.670 --> 05:50:27.680 align:start position:0%
solution but it's not actually going to
 
05:50:29.868 --> 05:50:29.878 align:start position:0%
help us reduce the cyan
 
05:50:32.628 --> 05:50:32.638 align:start position:0%
bacteria thank you representative um Ros
 
05:50:34.150 --> 05:50:34.160 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak to your second
 
05:50:37.230 --> 05:50:37.240 align:start position:0%
sure Mr chairman thank you um
 
05:50:38.868 --> 05:50:38.878 align:start position:0%
the representative is correct and I
 
05:50:40.270 --> 05:50:40.280 align:start position:0%
would like to
 
05:50:43.670 --> 05:50:43.680 align:start position:0%
State I agree what was what was stated
 
05:50:45.628 --> 05:50:45.638 align:start position:0%
at the hearing I I certainly do not
 
05:50:48.110 --> 05:50:48.120 align:start position:0%
think that people should be uh putting
 
05:50:50.030 --> 05:50:50.040 align:start position:0%
their their leaves their yard waste into
 
05:50:53.468 --> 05:50:53.478 align:start position:0%
a river or into a lake um I also think
 
05:50:55.670 --> 05:50:55.680 align:start position:0%
that we know we talk about a lot about
 
05:50:57.510 --> 05:50:57.520 align:start position:0%
education and how things are enforced
 
05:50:58.788 --> 05:50:58.798 align:start position:0%
and there was a lot of questions that
 
05:51:00.030 --> 05:51:00.040 align:start position:0%
were not able to be answered at the
 
05:51:02.430 --> 05:51:02.440 align:start position:0%
hearing and one of them was enforcement
 
05:51:05.270 --> 05:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
I think that this this could probably be
 
05:51:08.468 --> 05:51:08.478 align:start position:0%
dealt with with educ a and I would like
 
05:51:11.110 --> 05:51:11.120 align:start position:0%
to go that route and I also um agree
 
05:51:12.430 --> 05:51:12.440 align:start position:0%
with my colleague when he mentioned
 
05:51:14.548 --> 05:51:14.558 align:start position:0%
about you know environmental
 
05:51:16.590 --> 05:51:16.600 align:start position:0%
environmental legislation and and that
 
05:51:18.628 --> 05:51:18.638 align:start position:0%
forth that might be the better route to
 
05:51:22.430 --> 05:51:22.440 align:start position:0%
go so I think if we retain it um we can
 
05:51:24.708 --> 05:51:24.718 align:start position:0%
see if we can get any input on that and
 
05:51:26.910 --> 05:51:26.920 align:start position:0%
and take it up over the whenever we take
 
05:51:28.670 --> 05:51:28.680 align:start position:0%
this up a summer or whenever that would
 
05:51:30.590 --> 05:51:30.600 align:start position:0%
be thank you and that and that's
 
05:51:32.510 --> 05:51:32.520 align:start position:0%
precisely why I did not want to itl this
 
05:51:35.750 --> 05:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
bill I do think that it has worth um the
 
05:51:37.590 --> 05:51:37.600 align:start position:0%
thought of somebody dumping stuff into a
 
05:51:41.430 --> 05:51:41.440 align:start position:0%
lake grass or leaves just really makes
 
05:51:44.030 --> 05:51:44.040 align:start position:0%
me unhappy so um I think that we need to
 
05:51:46.190 --> 05:51:46.200 align:start position:0%
look at is this the right way to go
 
05:51:47.788 --> 05:51:47.798 align:start position:0%
about that or should it be part of a
 
05:51:50.150 --> 05:51:50.160 align:start position:0%
bigger picture so I actually do want to
 
05:51:52.548 --> 05:51:52.558 align:start position:0%
look at this over the break um and learn
 
05:51:55.110 --> 05:51:55.120 align:start position:0%
more about these cob bacteria thingies
 
05:51:56.468 --> 05:51:56.478 align:start position:0%
myself because I don't know a lot about
 
05:51:59.270 --> 05:51:59.280 align:start position:0%
them um any further
 
05:52:01.548 --> 05:52:01.558 align:start position:0%

environmental um legislation part of the
 
05:55:55.270 --> 05:55:55.280 align:start position:0%
the uh way to
 
05:55:55.280 --> 05:55:57.430 align:start position:0%
the uh way to
to

05:55:57.430 --> 05:55:57.440 align:start position:0%

encourage citizens to be good stewards
 
05:56:04.788 --> 05:56:04.798 align:start position:0%
of our of our environment is education
 
05:56:09.190 --> 05:56:09.200 align:start position:0%
um we also spoke with uh uh trying to
 
05:56:13.030 --> 05:56:13.040 align:start position:0%
think of the person from the uh Lakes
 
05:56:16.510 --> 05:56:16.520 align:start position:0%
Association and um they agreed that part
 
05:56:19.230 --> 05:56:19.240 align:start position:0%
of the um the information that they
 
05:56:22.548 --> 05:56:22.558 align:start position:0%
provide to uh Property Owners around
 
05:56:25.110 --> 05:56:25.120 align:start position:0%
Lakes uh it it includes things like
 
05:56:29.948 --> 05:56:29.958 align:start position:0%
changes in in law um this amendment
 
05:56:33.788 --> 05:56:33.798 align:start position:0%
changes the
 
05:56:37.390 --> 05:56:37.400 align:start position:0%
um changes the penalty the the penalties
 
05:56:40.788 --> 05:56:40.798 align:start position:0%
and would change it to should a a person
 
05:56:43.670 --> 05:56:43.680 align:start position:0%
or the corporate agent so if a a person
 
05:56:47.270 --> 05:56:47.280 align:start position:0%
hired just say say I don't know ABC
 
05:56:52.430 --> 05:56:52.440 align:start position:0%
company um the upon that first initial
 
05:56:54.830 --> 05:56:54.840 align:start position:0%
incorrect application either the wrong
 
05:56:58.670 --> 05:56:58.680 align:start position:0%
uh the wrong fertilizer or um in a
 
05:57:01.230 --> 05:57:01.240 align:start position:0%
fertilizer incorrectly applied they
 
05:57:03.310 --> 05:57:03.320 align:start position:0%
would receive a warning for the first
 
05:57:06.948 --> 05:57:06.958 align:start position:0%
offense uh both the the homeowner and
 
05:57:10.708 --> 05:57:10.718 align:start position:0%
the the agent that um did the um did the
 
05:57:13.070 --> 05:57:13.080 align:start position:0%
application the second time they would
 
05:57:15.830 --> 05:57:15.840 align:start position:0%
be guilty of a violation and subject to
 
05:57:19.110 --> 05:57:19.120 align:start position:0%
a $250 fine per acre just just for the
 
05:57:22.590 --> 05:57:22.600 align:start position:0%
second offense and the a misdemeanor for
 
05:57:25.110 --> 05:57:25.120 align:start position:0%
third or subsequent offense there is a
 
05:57:32.070 --> 05:57:32.080 align:start position:0%
huge cost to tourism Lakes are um fish
 
05:57:34.948 --> 05:57:34.958 align:start position:0%
um I know there are there are um land
 
05:57:37.390 --> 05:57:37.400 align:start position:0%
owners that have some camps around lakes
 
05:57:39.830 --> 05:57:39.840 align:start position:0%
and they can't have kids um swim in the
 
05:57:42.230 --> 05:57:42.240 align:start position:0%
water if they're cyano bacteria so this
 
05:57:46.150 --> 05:57:46.160 align:start position:0%
would um go a long way in uh reminding
 
05:57:47.468 --> 05:57:47.478 align:start position:0%
people and I think people try to do the
 
05:57:48.990 --> 05:57:49.000 align:start position:0%
right thing when they know about it and
 
05:57:50.670 --> 05:57:50.680 align:start position:0%
I I think that the um Lakes Association
 
05:57:53.190 --> 05:57:53.200 align:start position:0%
would do a really good job of of um
 
05:57:56.310 --> 05:57:56.320 align:start position:0%
helping spread the information and um
 
05:57:58.868 --> 05:57:58.878 align:start position:0%
around the this proposed
 
05:58:01.510 --> 05:58:01.520 align:start position:0%
amendment thank you representative um
 
05:58:01.520 --> 05:58:03.468 align:start position:0%
amendment thank you representative um
representative

05:58:03.468 --> 05:58:03.478 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:58:06.830 --> 05:58:06.840 align:start position:0%
Pro so I agree with most of that
 
05:58:09.110 --> 05:58:09.120 align:start position:0%
except for the agent part right if
 
05:58:11.350 --> 05:58:11.360 align:start position:0%
you're a professional landscaping
 
05:58:13.670 --> 05:58:13.680 align:start position:0%
company you should know
 
05:58:15.830 --> 05:58:15.840 align:start position:0%
this so I think they should get a
 
05:58:17.390 --> 05:58:17.400 align:start position:0%
violation for a
 
05:58:21.590 --> 05:58:21.600 align:start position:0%
shot right joku citizen I'm okay with a
 
05:58:23.788 --> 05:58:23.798 align:start position:0%
with a a warning the first time
 
05:58:25.310 --> 05:58:25.320 align:start position:0%
violation the second time and the rest
 
05:58:27.590 --> 05:58:27.600 align:start position:0%
of that but I'm thinking the agent who's
 
05:58:30.150 --> 05:58:30.160 align:start position:0%
a professional should know what they're
 
05:58:32.750 --> 05:58:32.760 align:start position:0%
doing and if they're doing it they're
 
05:58:36.390 --> 05:58:36.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:36.400 --> 05:58:42.868 align:start position:0%
 
president

05:58:42.868 --> 05:58:42.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:45.110 --> 05:58:45.120 align:start position:0%
Newman yeah I I was going to say I would
 
05:58:49.708 --> 05:58:49.718 align:start position:0%
think that um having the fine $250
 
05:58:51.070 --> 05:58:51.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't sound like a big deal but if
 
05:58:52.548 --> 05:58:52.558 align:start position:0%
you're a large company and you're doing
 
05:58:55.030 --> 05:58:55.040 align:start position:0%
a lot of lakefront homes you could rack
 
05:58:58.548 --> 05:58:58.558 align:start position:0%
up a lot of $250 fines in one day and
 
05:59:01.110 --> 05:59:01.120 align:start position:0%
essentially get to number three
 
05:59:04.270 --> 05:59:04.280 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor very quickly so I you know I
 
05:59:07.270 --> 05:59:07.280 align:start position:0%
I I understand and I I agree that those
 
05:59:09.948 --> 05:59:09.958 align:start position:0%
people that citizens entrust to do the
 
05:59:12.390 --> 05:59:12.400 align:start position:0%
right thing um have somewhat of more of
 
05:59:15.468 --> 05:59:15.478 align:start position:0%
a responsibility but I feel like if the
 
05:59:20.350 --> 05:59:20.360 align:start position:0%
if this would this would release any um
 
05:59:22.468 --> 05:59:22.478 align:start position:0%
chance of well it's the home owner's
 
05:59:26.548 --> 05:59:26.558 align:start position:0%
fault they told me or the um the uh
 
05:59:29.150 --> 05:59:29.160 align:start position:0%
agent saying uh you know whose
 
05:59:31.190 --> 05:59:31.200 align:start position:0%
responsibility is it it takes it all out
 
05:59:33.190 --> 05:59:33.200 align:start position:0%
makes things consistent there's no
 
05:59:37.350 --> 05:59:37.360 align:start position:0%
unknowns um and I think when a a company
 
05:59:42.150 --> 05:59:42.160 align:start position:0%
um you know is known as violating this
 
05:59:44.990 --> 05:59:45.000 align:start position:0%
it impacts business as well
 
05:59:48.510 --> 05:59:48.520 align:start position:0%
so I think for simp Simplicity sake it's
 
05:59:50.788 --> 05:59:50.798 align:start position:0%
representative Newman I just have
 
05:59:52.590 --> 05:59:52.600 align:start position:0%
parlamentary inquir you going to restate
 
05:59:54.868 --> 05:59:54.878 align:start position:0%
the motion and all of that sort that out
 
05:59:57.910 --> 05:59:57.920 align:start position:0%
in a minute um this is why it chose
 
05:59:59.390 --> 05:59:59.400 align:start position:0%
criminal justice because we're always
 
06:00:03.830 --> 06:00:03.840 align:start position:0%
steeped in manure no
 
06:00:06.310 --> 06:00:06.320 align:start position:0%
um okay so right now we're going to be
 
06:00:09.430 --> 06:00:09.440 align:start position:0%
voting on is a motion to adopt want to
 
06:00:12.948 --> 06:00:12.958 align:start position:0%
what resp never mind just vote on it
 
06:00:15.830 --> 06:00:15.840 align:start position:0%
okay it is getting close to four o'clock
 
06:00:17.628 --> 06:00:17.638 align:start position:0%
um we're going to motion to adopt the
 
06:00:19.990 --> 06:00:20.000 align:start position:0%
amendment correct
 
06:00:22.990 --> 06:00:23.000 align:start position:0%
yes who did oh I'm sorry Rich did you
 
06:00:24.750 --> 06:00:24.760 align:start position:0%

executive session and I open the
 
06:03:02.110 --> 06:03:02.120 align:start position:0%

motion uh of L to
 
06:03:14.990 --> 06:03:15.000 align:start position:0%
pass second by representative Murray
 
06:03:18.110 --> 06:03:18.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:21.190 --> 06:03:21.200 align:start position:0%
motion this is a bill that was uh that I
 
06:03:22.548 --> 06:03:22.558 align:start position:0%
was actually asked to file by the
 
06:03:24.230 --> 06:03:24.240 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections and what it
 
06:03:28.910 --> 06:03:28.920 align:start position:0%
would do is it would uh change uh the
 
06:03:30.990 --> 06:03:31.000 align:start position:0%
parameters of alternative home
 
06:03:33.230 --> 06:03:33.240 align:start position:0%
confinement uh so that people who want
 
06:03:36.390 --> 06:03:36.400 align:start position:0%
to take uh Secondary College courses
 
06:03:39.310 --> 06:03:39.320 align:start position:0%
uh in the uh or secondary posteducation
 
06:03:41.468 --> 06:03:41.478 align:start position:0%
courses uh in the towns where they're
 
06:03:44.310 --> 06:03:44.320 align:start position:0%
confined are uh are actually able to do
 
06:03:48.990 --> 06:03:49.000 align:start position:0%
that so this is something that um has
 
06:03:50.948 --> 06:03:50.958 align:start position:0%
potential um you know to be
 
06:03:53.230 --> 06:03:53.240 align:start position:0%
life-changing for some of for people who
 
06:03:57.510 --> 06:03:57.520 align:start position:0%
basically are among the most qualified
 
06:04:01.190 --> 06:04:01.200 align:start position:0%
people uh to be eligible for release uh
 
06:04:03.670 --> 06:04:03.680 align:start position:0%
so these are these are people who who
 
06:04:06.430 --> 06:04:06.440 align:start position:0%
basically um the uh Department of
 
06:04:09.430 --> 06:04:09.440 align:start position:0%
Corrections itself uh is willing to uh
 
06:04:11.310 --> 06:04:11.320 align:start position:0%
to gamble on these are folks that have
 
06:04:13.150 --> 06:04:13.160 align:start position:0%
been approved for alternative home
 
06:04:17.110 --> 06:04:17.120 align:start position:0%
confinement um and uh essentially these
 
06:04:19.628 --> 06:04:19.638 align:start position:0%
are folks who are uh either monitored
 
06:04:21.788 --> 06:04:21.798 align:start position:0%
directly by the department or or who
 
06:04:23.750 --> 06:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
have some type of uh electronic
 
06:04:28.548 --> 06:04:28.558 align:start position:0%
monitoring device they are only uh uh
 
06:04:31.190 --> 06:04:31.200 align:start position:0%
allowed to go outside their homes uh for
 
06:04:34.310 --> 06:04:34.320 align:start position:0%
things like uh employment opportunities
 
06:04:36.468 --> 06:04:36.478 align:start position:0%
uh uh and I think I believe public
 
06:04:39.788 --> 06:04:39.798 align:start position:0%
service jobs uh as well now this would
 
06:04:42.750 --> 06:04:42.760 align:start position:0%
actually expand it to uh post-secondary
 
06:04:44.990 --> 06:04:45.000 align:start position:0%
educational opportunities where this can
 
06:04:47.548 --> 06:04:47.558 align:start position:0%
come up as a practical matter sometimes
 
06:04:49.910 --> 06:04:49.920 align:start position:0%
is if you look at uh places like the
 
06:04:51.430 --> 06:04:51.440 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth Naval Shipyard that's over
 
06:04:53.590 --> 06:04:53.600 align:start position:0%
near where I am um they have
 
06:04:56.548 --> 06:04:56.558 align:start position:0%
apprenticeship programs that actually uh
 
06:04:59.868 --> 06:04:59.878 align:start position:0%
require uh folks to uh to work on site
 
06:05:02.948 --> 06:05:02.958 align:start position:0%
at the shipyard uh at at times uh but
 
06:05:05.350 --> 06:05:05.360 align:start position:0%
there there are also courses uh that
 
06:05:07.910 --> 06:05:07.920 align:start position:0%
people are required to take uh as part
 
06:05:09.788 --> 06:05:09.798 align:start position:0%
of that over at Granite community
 
06:05:13.190 --> 06:05:13.200 align:start position:0%
community college so not quite sure how
 
06:05:15.390 --> 06:05:15.400 align:start position:0%
how many uh Blended opportunities there
 
06:05:17.310 --> 06:05:17.320 align:start position:0%
are but there's a really practical
 
06:05:19.948 --> 06:05:19.958 align:start position:0%
example of where a bill like this uh
 
06:05:22.030 --> 06:05:22.040 align:start position:0%
could really help some could maybe be
 
06:05:25.310 --> 06:05:25.320 align:start position:0%
the difference between uh somebody being
 
06:05:27.750 --> 06:05:27.760 align:start position:0%
able to transition smoothly into life
 
06:05:31.708 --> 06:05:31.718 align:start position:0%
outside of prison um and not be at risk
 
06:05:34.628 --> 06:05:34.638 align:start position:0%
to go back to prison uh
 
06:05:36.910 --> 06:05:36.920 align:start position:0%
versus may be increasing that risk a
 
06:05:39.628 --> 06:05:39.638 align:start position:0%
little bit so uh again this was
 
06:05:41.990 --> 06:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
requested by the uh by the Department of
 
06:05:43.868 --> 06:05:43.878 align:start position:0%
Corrections and uh and I hope you'll
 
06:05:46.390 --> 06:05:46.400 align:start position:0%
support it thank you representa would
 
06:05:47.590 --> 06:05:47.600 align:start position:0%
you like to speak to your second
 
06:05:50.750 --> 06:05:50.760 align:start position:0%
represent Murray um just to say that I
 
06:05:52.110 --> 06:05:52.120 align:start position:0%
definitely think we should be passing
 
06:05:54.788 --> 06:05:54.798 align:start position:0%
any legislation that can help reduce
 
06:05:57.910 --> 06:05:57.920 align:start position:0%
recidivism I agree any further
 
06:06:00.030 --> 06:06:00.040 align:start position:0%
discussion actually I have a question
 
06:06:04.510 --> 06:06:04.520 align:start position:0%
yes is uh is it is this for like online
 
06:06:06.548 --> 06:06:06.558 align:start position:0%
school only or is that they can go out
 
06:06:08.910 --> 06:06:08.920 align:start position:0%
to a you would be able to do either you
 
06:06:10.868 --> 06:06:10.878 align:start position:0%
would be able to go online or you would
 
06:06:13.190 --> 06:06:13.200 align:start position:0%
be able to go out into the to community
 
06:06:15.270 --> 06:06:15.280 align:start position:0%
the thing is is the way alternative home
 
06:06:17.548 --> 06:06:17.558 align:start position:0%
confinement works is you have to be back
 
06:06:20.468 --> 06:06:20.478 align:start position:0%
in your house by a specific time of of
 
06:06:22.350 --> 06:06:22.360 align:start position:0%
of the day if you're not you're in
 
06:06:23.868 --> 06:06:23.878 align:start position:0%
violation of your terms and they can
 
06:06:25.830 --> 06:06:25.840 align:start position:0%
take you back this is something they
 
06:06:28.350 --> 06:06:28.360 align:start position:0%
already do if you have an for instance
 
06:06:30.590 --> 06:06:30.600 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a job that you have
 
06:06:32.628 --> 06:06:32.638 align:start position:0%
outside currently our statute only
 
06:06:35.548 --> 06:06:35.558 align:start position:0%
allows it for uh you know for employ
 
06:06:37.830 --> 06:06:37.840 align:start position:0%
employment uh or for uncompensated
 
06:06:40.190 --> 06:06:40.200 align:start position:0%
public service okay so so this would
 
06:06:42.788 --> 06:06:42.798 align:start position:0%
basically you know give somebody the
 
06:06:44.390 --> 06:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
option to do something like you know
 
06:06:46.468 --> 06:06:46.478 align:start position:0%
take a business course take a course
 
06:06:48.468 --> 06:06:48.478 align:start position:0%
that's necessary for an apprenticeship
 
06:06:50.750 --> 06:06:50.760 align:start position:0%
that type of thing thank you represent M
