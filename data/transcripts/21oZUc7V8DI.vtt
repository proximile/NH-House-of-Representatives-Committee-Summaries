get started here in a few minutes um
 
00:04:58.629 --> 00:04:58.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:28.629 align:start position:0%

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:30.360 align:start position:0%
um being afternoon
 
00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:33.720 align:start position:0%
uh I'm going to go ahead and call into
 
00:06:36.589 --> 00:06:36.599 align:start position:0%
session um division 3's work session
 
00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:40.000 align:start position:0%
today we've got nine bills to look at
 
00:06:41.589 --> 00:06:41.599 align:start position:0%
we've we're going to try to get through
 
00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
five of them before 2 o'cl there are
 
00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:45.720 align:start position:0%
some more complicated ones that'll start
 
00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
after two um the the issue uh that I'm
 
00:06:53.309 --> 00:06:53.319 align:start position:0%
sort of thumb wrestling right now is
 
00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:56.800 align:start position:0%
that we have three of our division 3
 
00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:00.160 align:start position:0%
people who are occupied simultaneously
 
00:07:04.189 --> 00:07:04.199 align:start position:0%
over in this other meeting and um so I'm
 
00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:06.440 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm I'm going to call a 5 minute
 
00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:09.400 align:start position:0%
recess uh immediately it's just to
 
00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:10.960 align:start position:0%
figure out what we're going to do about
 
00:07:13.629 --> 00:07:13.639 align:start position:0%
the missing three people to the division
 
00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:16.080 align:start position:0%
so it's just going to take a moment
 
00:07:24.189 --> 00:07:24.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:28.520 align:start position:0%

Democrat that's that's potentially the
 
00:10:58.990 --> 00:10:59.000 align:start position:0%
margin of error here so so but we're
 
00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:02.440 align:start position:0%
going to try to move through these bills
 
00:11:05.629 --> 00:11:05.639 align:start position:0%
um uh to to see if we can resolve some
 
00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:08.320 align:start position:0%
of them today so that the clerk can be
 
00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:10.440 align:start position:0%
messing with it and get them ready for a
 
00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:13.720 align:start position:0%
house vote uh earlier rather than later
 
00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
so um we're going to go and then we're
 
00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:18.600 align:start position:0%

so if you're here for 1588 1593 159 8
 
00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:33.680 align:start position:0%
1573 if you're here for any of those um
 
00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:35.360 align:start position:0%
you've got time to go get a cup of
 
00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:38.720 align:start position:0%
coffee at least so I'm going to start
 
00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:42.760 align:start position:0%
with um 1564 relative to the child
 
00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:44.110 align:start position:0%
with um 1564 relative to the child
support

00:11:44.110 --> 00:11:44.120 align:start position:0%
support
 
00:11:46.509 --> 00:11:46.519 align:start position:0%
guidelines is there anyone here in the
 
00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:49.200 align:start position:0%
uh audience that came to speak
 
00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
specifically about
 
00:11:55.069 --> 00:11:55.079 align:start position:0%
1564 not seeing any do is there a
 
00:11:57.190 --> 00:11:57.200 align:start position:0%
motion on
 
00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:01.040 align:start position:0%
1564 oh do you have a motion I do have a
 
00:12:04.069 --> 00:12:04.079 align:start position:0%
motion make a motion about to pass uh is
 
00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:05.240 align:start position:0%
there a
 
00:12:08.949 --> 00:12:08.959 align:start position:0%
second second okay any discussion would
 
00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:11.200 align:start position:0%
you like to discuss your
 
00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:13.670 align:start position:0%
you like to discuss your
motion

00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:13.680 align:start position:0%
motion
 
00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:15.670 align:start position:0%
motion
sure

00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:15.680 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:12:20.189 --> 00:12:20.199 align:start position:0%
um I've heard people say that
 
00:12:23.269 --> 00:12:23.279 align:start position:0%
1564 um is a widely accepted bill it
 
00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:25.720 align:start position:0%
came out of committee unanimously it was
 
00:12:27.069 --> 00:12:27.079 align:start position:0%
passed on a Voice vote on the house
 
00:12:30.829 --> 00:12:30.839 align:start position:0%
floor um quote it's a no-brainer um I
 
00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:32.240 align:start position:0%
believe that this is
 
00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:37.160 align:start position:0%
an um pretty reasonable um one to move
 
00:12:39.389 --> 00:12:39.399 align:start position:0%
forward right now and I would appreciate
 
00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:41.600 align:start position:0%
the support of the division
 
00:12:44.069 --> 00:12:44.079 align:start position:0%
members any other
 
00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:47.000 align:start position:0%
discussion uh go ahead represent stream
 
00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:48.880 align:start position:0%
uh this just one comment and that is
 
00:12:50.629 --> 00:12:50.639 align:start position:0%
there are some costs to implement this
 
00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:51.880 align:start position:0%
and I just want to make sure the
 
00:12:55.629 --> 00:12:55.639 align:start position:0%
committee understands that um uh I I
 
00:12:57.030 --> 00:12:57.040 align:start position:0%
believe with the bill and coming out of
 
00:12:59.230 --> 00:12:59.240 align:start position:0%
finances that our recommendation is that
 
00:13:03.230 --> 00:13:03.240 align:start position:0%
that the $90,000 of of cost is going to
 
00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:04.920 align:start position:0%
come out of existing funds with no
 
00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:07.560 align:start position:0%
additional appropriation and whether
 
00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:09.360 align:start position:0%
that's uh supported by the rest of the
 
00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:13.560 align:start position:0%
committee otherwise I'm uh 100% behind
 
00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:18.760 align:start position:0%
OTP um excellent uh uh is there anyone
 
00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:22.000 align:start position:0%
uh who opposes us executing this and and
 
00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:26.120 align:start position:0%
we don't formally exec but exact like
 
00:13:28.269 --> 00:13:28.279 align:start position:0%
let vote it out of the division to send
 
00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:29.560 align:start position:0%
it to the finance Comm committee is
 
00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:32.800 align:start position:0%
there anyone opposed to are doing that
 
00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:37.360 align:start position:0%
now not not not no opposition um I am
 
00:13:39.189 --> 00:13:39.199 align:start position:0%
concerned about the bill so do do you
 
00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
want to speak to your position
 
00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:44.360 align:start position:0%
absolutely um I I do think there's value
 
00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:46.120 align:start position:0%
in sending the bills to the Senate and
 
00:13:49.269 --> 00:13:49.279 align:start position:0%
having them take a look at these we have
 
00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:50.920 align:start position:0%
two bills that affect the same section
 
00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:53.600 align:start position:0%
of statutes that impact the same
 
00:13:57.670 --> 00:13:57.680 align:start position:0%
families in different ways and while I
 
00:13:58.870 --> 00:13:58.880 align:start position:0%
believe there might be an amendment to
 
00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:01.560 align:start position:0%
help make them more mutually compatible
 
00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:03.680 align:start position:0%
um passing this one first without taking
 
00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:04.680 align:start position:0%
up the other one is a little bit
 
00:14:07.269 --> 00:14:07.279 align:start position:0%
concerning I'd rather study this one or
 
00:14:08.629 --> 00:14:08.639 align:start position:0%
hold this one and have the other one
 
00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:10.480 align:start position:0%
discussed and then take them both up at
 
00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:11.430 align:start position:0%
discussed and then take them both up at
the

00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:11.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:16.000 align:start position:0%
end as of now I'm I would be um a nay
 
00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
vote on autop pass and an inum study
 
00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:20.560 align:start position:0%
motion or at least wait until we take
 
00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
them both up at the same
 
00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:26.560 align:start position:0%
time I I I hear you and um I'm probably
 
00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:29.600 align:start position:0%
violating some house rule or protocol on
 
00:14:32.829 --> 00:14:32.839 align:start position:0%
talking about two bills when one is up
 
00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:35.440 align:start position:0%
um um but we're a work session and I
 
00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:37.880 align:start position:0%
think we have more flexibility than
 
00:14:42.069 --> 00:14:42.079 align:start position:0%
others uh it it it's my thought that we
 
00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:43.680 align:start position:0%
we go ahead and pass
 
00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
1564 it's got strong support as uh
 
00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
representative tersi summarized for us
 
00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:51.720 align:start position:0%
it's got di Minimus cost as
 
00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:55.000 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham said to us I I
 
00:14:57.509 --> 00:14:57.519 align:start position:0%
I I'd like to go ahead and get it uh
 
00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:01.120 align:start position:0%
passed and uh use it sort of as a as a
 
00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:03.480 align:start position:0%
baseline sort of the mothership that
 
00:15:06.389 --> 00:15:06.399 align:start position:0%
we'll talk about 95 in a moment to
 
00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
figure out how the two bills uh interact
 
00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
with one another that that that's my
 
00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:15.480 align:start position:0%
goal okay so are you ready to no
 
00:15:17.710 --> 00:15:17.720 align:start position:0%
objection to that plan are you ready to
 
00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:20.040 align:start position:0%

passes
 
00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:04.600 align:start position:0%
um with with that um I'll assign um me
 
00:16:06.749 --> 00:16:06.759 align:start position:0%
to write the uh the
 
00:16:11.509 --> 00:16:11.519 align:start position:0%
blurb um all right with um Okay so we've
 
00:16:11.519 --> 00:16:12.949 align:start position:0%
blurb um all right with um Okay so we've
resolved

00:16:12.949 --> 00:16:12.959 align:start position:0%
resolved
 
00:16:17.749 --> 00:16:17.759 align:start position:0%
1564 uh let's open the discussion on
 
00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
1595 um I understand there's an
 
00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:23.360 align:start position:0%
amendment and I I think it's Scott
 
00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:26.240 align:start position:0%
Edwards on it and I is is Miss Rebecca
 
00:16:29.269 --> 00:16:29.279 align:start position:0%
Hutchins here would you please take a
 
00:16:45.269 --> 00:16:45.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:53.309 --> 00:16:53.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:59.430 --> 00:16:59.440 align:start position:0%
thanks okay so oh oh welcome
 
00:17:02.749 --> 00:17:02.759 align:start position:0%
uh just so you know uh we we went ahead
 
00:17:08.110 --> 00:17:08.120 align:start position:0%
and heard 1564 and voted it out 5 to1 uh
 
00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:10.400 align:start position:0%
there was really no controversy there
 
00:17:12.829 --> 00:17:12.839 align:start position:0%
we're now on
 
00:17:14.909 --> 00:17:14.919 align:start position:0%
1595 um to
 
00:17:18.669 --> 00:17:18.679 align:start position:0%
t595 uh We've um in division three we've
 
00:17:20.789 --> 00:17:20.799 align:start position:0%
had two prior work sessions we've talked
 
00:17:25.949 --> 00:17:25.959 align:start position:0%
about 1595 a couple of times uh and so
 
00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:29.080 align:start position:0%
uh I'm going to um assume from that that
 
00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:31.400 align:start position:0%
the members of division 3 have a working
 
00:17:35.470 --> 00:17:35.480 align:start position:0%
familiarity with the what 1595 does and
 
00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:37.600 align:start position:0%
with that I think it's okay for you to
 
00:17:40.789 --> 00:17:40.799 align:start position:0%
go ahead and explain what you intended
 
00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:42.720 align:start position:0%
to do with this
 
00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:45.520 align:start position:0%
amendment thank you um for the record
 
00:17:47.789 --> 00:17:47.799 align:start position:0%
Rebecca Hutchins I'm from Dober New
 
00:17:50.350 --> 00:17:50.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um
 
00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
so there was a question um whether or
 
00:17:55.830 --> 00:17:55.840 align:start position:0%
not there was overlap between
 
00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:03.200 align:start position:0%
1564 and 1595 and so so um I took uh a
 
00:18:06.149 --> 00:18:06.159 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to to really look at
 
00:18:09.470 --> 00:18:09.480 align:start position:0%
both pieces of legislation and analyze
 
00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
where the overlap was and put together
 
00:18:14.350 --> 00:18:14.360 align:start position:0%
an amendment to remove any overlap I I
 
00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
am so sorry I should have invited
 
00:18:17.789 --> 00:18:17.799 align:start position:0%
representative bigford to come sit with
 
00:18:19.630 --> 00:18:19.640 align:start position:0%
you because it's he's the prime sponsor
 
00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
of the bill so my my apologies sir that
 
00:18:24.990 --> 00:18:25.000 align:start position:0%
was just an oversight on my part and I'm
 
00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:27.760 align:start position:0%
sorry to interrupt you miss
 
00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:33.510 align:start position:0%
sorry to interrupt you miss
Hutchin

00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:35.029 --> 00:18:35.039 align:start position:0%
it's quite all
 
00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:39.480 align:start position:0%
right um so I handed out a a small
 
00:18:41.789 --> 00:18:41.799 align:start position:0%
handout that kind of talks through um
 
00:18:44.510 --> 00:18:44.520 align:start position:0%
where there was overlap in the two
 
00:18:47.149 --> 00:18:47.159 align:start position:0%
pieces of legislation and just to to
 
00:18:50.789 --> 00:18:50.799 align:start position:0%
clarify any confusion about that and to
 
00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:53.400 align:start position:0%
show how the amendment just removes any
 
00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:55.520 align:start position:0%
overlap of these two bills so that they
 
00:18:57.470 --> 00:18:57.480 align:start position:0%
can both live quite
 
00:19:00.190 --> 00:19:00.200 align:start position:0%
independently um the four sections of
 
00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:05.120 align:start position:0%
law that uh both bills deal with um you
 
00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:07.720 align:start position:0%
can see that in two of those uh so the
 
00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
The Columns at the top show those four
 
00:19:14.470 --> 00:19:14.480 align:start position:0%
sections there's uh RSA 458 C chins R
 
00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:18.240 align:start position:0%
RSA 458 C5 is the adjustment of the
 
00:19:20.710 --> 00:19:20.720 align:start position:0%
application of guidelines under special
 
00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:22.840 align:start position:0%
circumstances that's where the bulk of
 
00:19:27.909 --> 00:19:27.919 align:start position:0%
1564 deals with and then RSA 458 C3 is
 
00:19:30.789 --> 00:19:30.799 align:start position:0%
where the bulk of 1595 deals with and
 
00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:33.400 align:start position:0%
there are no changes on 1564 to that
 
00:19:35.909 --> 00:19:35.919 align:start position:0%
section of Law and then there's a small
 
00:19:40.350 --> 00:19:40.360 align:start position:0%
um definition in RSA 461 that uh
 
00:19:43.870 --> 00:19:43.880 align:start position:0%
hb564 put in you can see on the first
 
00:19:46.029 --> 00:19:46.039 align:start position:0%
page the areas of red that just show the
 
00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:48.720 align:start position:0%
overlap so the it's actually quite small
 
00:19:50.789 --> 00:19:50.799 align:start position:0%
in the definitions really there was just
 
00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:53.440 align:start position:0%
an overlap on the the word the
 
00:19:55.870 --> 00:19:55.880 align:start position:0%
definition of parenting time and so what
 
00:19:58.789 --> 00:19:58.799 align:start position:0%
we've done in the amendment is adopt the
 
00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:00.280 align:start position:0%
definition that
 
00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
hb564 used and then just add on to that
 
00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:05.360 align:start position:0%
a little bit about how you use that in a
 
00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:07.320 align:start position:0%
calculation essentially you need to
 
00:20:10.190 --> 00:20:10.200 align:start position:0%
equal 100% if you're talking about uh
 
00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:13.600 align:start position:0%
multiple people and parenting
 
00:20:17.190 --> 00:20:17.200 align:start position:0%
time um and then the second section of
 
00:20:20.430 --> 00:20:20.440 align:start position:0%
law um the adjustments what we've done
 
00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:24.600 align:start position:0%
with the amendment is just remove any uh
 
00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:27.720 align:start position:0%
anything that we had in that section of
 
00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:29.200 align:start position:0%
the statute
 
00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:32.000 align:start position:0%
um so that there now is no o no overlap
 
00:20:34.270 --> 00:20:34.280 align:start position:0%
so the amendment that's in front of you
 
00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:36.880 align:start position:0%
uh just adjusts parenting time as a
 
00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:40.960 align:start position:0%
definition and removes uh any part that
 
00:20:43.149 --> 00:20:43.159 align:start position:0%
we had in the adjustments to the
 
00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:46.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:52.280 align:start position:0%
guidelines all right um so so just so
 
00:20:54.750 --> 00:20:54.760 align:start position:0%
the division knows where I'm leaning on
 
00:20:56.390 --> 00:20:56.400 align:start position:0%
this and where there's still plenty of
 
00:20:58.190 --> 00:20:58.200 align:start position:0%
time to discuss this and disagree
 
00:20:58.200 --> 00:20:59.350 align:start position:0%
time to discuss this and disagree
potentially

00:20:59.350 --> 00:20:59.360 align:start position:0%
potentially
 
00:21:03.230 --> 00:21:03.240 align:start position:0%
was um I uh I I got a call from Miss
 
00:21:05.669 --> 00:21:05.679 align:start position:0%
Hutchins late last week she's been
 
00:21:07.669 --> 00:21:07.679 align:start position:0%
following this issue with representative
 
00:21:10.269 --> 00:21:10.279 align:start position:0%
bigford for quite a while she sat in on
 
00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:12.240 align:start position:0%
our previous work sessions and she said
 
00:21:15.350 --> 00:21:15.360 align:start position:0%
she had a good idea on how to get the
 
00:21:18.630 --> 00:21:18.640 align:start position:0%
two bills to coexist and not conflict
 
00:21:22.669 --> 00:21:22.679 align:start position:0%
with each other and uh then I I was kind
 
00:21:25.269 --> 00:21:25.279 align:start position:0%
of a bit of a jerk with her I said hey
 
00:21:27.350 --> 00:21:27.360 align:start position:0%
at this point this late in the process
 
00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:28.880 align:start position:0%
what you would need to do is you would
 
00:21:30.789 --> 00:21:30.799 align:start position:0%
need to put a side by side together and
 
00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:32.440 align:start position:0%
you'd need to draft the amendment
 
00:21:34.990 --> 00:21:35.000 align:start position:0%
because there's just no time and she did
 
00:21:37.029 --> 00:21:37.039 align:start position:0%
all of that happily and willingly and
 
00:21:38.870 --> 00:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
it's here on time and I just want to
 
00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:41.360 align:start position:0%
really thank you for being an involved
 
00:21:44.549 --> 00:21:44.559 align:start position:0%
active uh Citizen and like to see in the
 
00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:48.320 align:start position:0%
legislature someday so uh uh
 
00:21:50.549 --> 00:21:50.559 align:start position:0%
representative bigford um do you have
 
00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:53.120 align:start position:0%
any uh comments about the amendment have
 
00:21:55.630 --> 00:21:55.640 align:start position:0%
you seen it do you have an opinion sir I
 
00:21:58.669 --> 00:21:58.679 align:start position:0%
I don't see any problem with it um I
 
00:22:01.950 --> 00:22:01.960 align:start position:0%
when we started our working group um
 
00:22:04.870 --> 00:22:04.880 align:start position:0%
actually she is our lead person there
 
00:22:06.549 --> 00:22:06.559 align:start position:0%
and that's what she does for living is
 
00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:11.320 align:start position:0%
problem solving for companies Etc
 
00:22:13.870 --> 00:22:13.880 align:start position:0%
um and no that she's I think she's
 
00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:16.760 align:start position:0%
solved the problem CU when we started we
 
00:22:18.430 --> 00:22:18.440 align:start position:0%
didn't know what the other Bill had in
 
00:22:20.110 --> 00:22:20.120 align:start position:0%
it so we wrote you know how they come
 
00:22:21.909 --> 00:22:21.919 align:start position:0%
out and it's like uh oh this but we
 
00:22:24.149 --> 00:22:24.159 align:start position:0%
didn't know where it was going so this
 
00:22:26.870 --> 00:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
solves all that problem and this is
 
00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:29.200 align:start position:0%
really good bill I mean this is this is
 
00:22:31.789 --> 00:22:31.799 align:start position:0%
the bill that was recommended for New
 
00:22:33.230 --> 00:22:33.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire from the study that New
 
00:22:35.029 --> 00:22:35.039 align:start position:0%
Hampshire did and paid
 
00:22:37.750 --> 00:22:37.760 align:start position:0%
$114,000 for plus the
 
00:22:41.669 --> 00:22:41.679 align:start position:0%
$140,000 from 2018 so it's and it fills
 
00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:43.360 align:start position:0%
that middle ground in May heard me on
 
00:22:45.029 --> 00:22:45.039 align:start position:0%
the floor I spoke about I say you've got
 
00:22:47.230 --> 00:22:47.240 align:start position:0%
the single parent over here and now
 
00:22:52.990 --> 00:22:53.000 align:start position:0%
we've got the uh with 64 is uh a a a way
 
00:22:56.549 --> 00:22:56.559 align:start position:0%
of going into uh two parents a shared
 
00:22:59.549 --> 00:22:59.559 align:start position:0%
parenting situation uh almost
 
00:23:02.430 --> 00:23:02.440 align:start position:0%
equal and so but we need something in
 
00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:04.960 align:start position:0%
between and that's what that's what this
 
00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
asks us to do to uh create that
 
00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:12.320 align:start position:0%
representative H is your comment for
 
00:23:14.669 --> 00:23:14.679 align:start position:0%
work session for between the division or
 
00:23:16.430 --> 00:23:16.440 align:start position:0%
do you have questions I have a question
 
00:23:18.510 --> 00:23:18.520 align:start position:0%
please ask your question representative
 
00:23:21.950 --> 00:23:21.960 align:start position:0%
Bickford so I have in my notes Here an
 
00:23:23.430 --> 00:23:23.440 align:start position:0%
amendment uh
 
00:23:26.549 --> 00:23:26.559 align:start position:0%
104h which was handed in during the last
 
00:23:28.789 --> 00:23:28.799 align:start position:0%
work session affecting section five of
 
00:23:32.110 --> 00:23:32.120 align:start position:0%
the bill I have the amendment from
 
00:23:35.789 --> 00:23:35.799 align:start position:0%
Edwards which affects only section
 
00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:38.960 align:start position:0%
two is the intent to adopt both of these
 
00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
concurrently or just adopt 101 sorry
 
00:23:46.350 --> 00:23:46.360 align:start position:0%
1172 and ignore the section changes to
 
00:23:51.029 --> 00:23:51.039 align:start position:0%
five except uh 1172 and ignore the
 
00:23:51.039 --> 00:23:52.029 align:start position:0%
five except uh 1172 and ignore the
previous

00:23:52.029 --> 00:23:52.039 align:start position:0%
previous
 
00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:54.720 align:start position:0%
one thank
 
00:23:57.350 --> 00:23:57.360 align:start position:0%
you and and so by ignoring it we just
 
00:24:01.029 --> 00:24:01.039 align:start position:0%
don't even need to introduce uce it so
 
00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:03.720 align:start position:0%
um go representative Leon uh thank you
 
00:24:05.549 --> 00:24:05.559 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I still want to call you Leon
 
00:24:08.549 --> 00:24:08.559 align:start position:0%
it's not so fancy lay on um I and I just
 
00:24:11.070 --> 00:24:11.080 align:start position:0%
wanted to note on lines 15 and 16 of
 
00:24:13.110 --> 00:24:13.120 align:start position:0%
this new Amendment it actually deletes
 
00:24:18.830 --> 00:24:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:21.960 align:start position:0%
way all right Mickey I I I forget what
 
00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:24.840 align:start position:0%
the order of this is do we have to uh
 
00:24:29.789 --> 00:24:29.799 align:start position:0%
introduce um um 1593 first and then the
 
00:24:32.310 --> 00:24:32.320 align:start position:0%
amendment or 1595 first and then the
 
00:24:33.870 --> 00:24:33.880 align:start position:0%
amendment or do we do the amendment
 
00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:39.760 align:start position:0%
Bill I'm not familiar with the division
 
00:24:41.549 --> 00:24:41.559 align:start position:0%
three practices I can tell you I think
 
00:24:43.470 --> 00:24:43.480 align:start position:0%
you'd probably be okay with somebody
 
00:24:46.190 --> 00:24:46.200 align:start position:0%
making a motion on adopting Amendment
 
00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:48.760 align:start position:0%
1172 and then take the bill up ought to
 
00:24:52.070 --> 00:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
pass as amended all right I I need a a
 
00:24:55.909 --> 00:24:55.919 align:start position:0%
motion to go ahead go ahead and the if
 
00:24:57.470 --> 00:24:57.480 align:start position:0%
it's a question for the work session
 
00:24:59.549 --> 00:24:59.559 align:start position:0%
let's introduce and then Talk Amongst
 
00:25:00.990 --> 00:25:01.000 align:start position:0%
ourselves I think you're supposed to
 
00:25:03.789 --> 00:25:03.799 align:start position:0%
introduce the bill and talk to the bill
 
00:25:07.669 --> 00:25:07.679 align:start position:0%
if so um do you want to make the motion
 
00:25:10.750 --> 00:25:10.760 align:start position:0%
to I'll move the amendment 1172 H for
 
00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:12.720 align:start position:0%
the purpose of having a discussion right
 
00:25:14.510 --> 00:25:14.520 align:start position:0%
now is there is there a
 
00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
second second okay so uh we can now
 
00:25:20.990 --> 00:25:21.000 align:start position:0%
discuss the amendment representative
 
00:25:25.389 --> 00:25:25.399 align:start position:0%
torki sure um thank you one of the
 
00:25:28.870 --> 00:25:28.880 align:start position:0%
concerns that I heard um about 159 95 is
 
00:25:32.110 --> 00:25:32.120 align:start position:0%
it doesn't take into account situations
 
00:25:36.149 --> 00:25:36.159 align:start position:0%
um of domestic violence and um would
 
00:25:38.269 --> 00:25:38.279 align:start position:0%
this amendment address that concern or
 
00:25:40.190 --> 00:25:40.200 align:start position:0%
does the bill still stay silent stay
 
00:25:44.389 --> 00:25:44.399 align:start position:0%
silent going that yeah um so
 
00:25:48.190 --> 00:25:48.200 align:start position:0%
the the hope is that both bills pass
 
00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
together and the domestic violence uh
 
00:25:54.750 --> 00:25:54.760 align:start position:0%
portion that was put into 1564 would
 
00:25:58.590 --> 00:25:58.600 align:start position:0%
stand with this also in it so it's the
 
00:26:01.990 --> 00:26:02.000 align:start position:0%
domestic violence um piece was a small
 
00:26:04.110 --> 00:26:04.120 align:start position:0%
Clause that went into the deviation
 
00:26:07.909 --> 00:26:07.919 align:start position:0%
section to remind folks of uh another
 
00:26:09.990 --> 00:26:10.000 align:start position:0%
section of law that protects domestic
 
00:26:12.990 --> 00:26:13.000 align:start position:0%
violence as any um Court when they're
 
00:26:16.870 --> 00:26:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:19.950 --> 00:26:19.960 align:start position:0%
orders no that answered my
 
00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:23.360 align:start position:0%
question representative H did you have a
 
00:26:25.630 --> 00:26:25.640 align:start position:0%
question do you have a comment for the
 
00:26:27.230 --> 00:26:27.240 align:start position:0%
work session for the good of the
 
00:26:30.549 --> 00:26:30.559 align:start position:0%
division um I would support the adoption
 
00:26:33.510 --> 00:26:33.520 align:start position:0%
of 1172 to
 
00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:36.720 align:start position:0%
1595 um I would move a to pass on the
 
00:26:38.029 --> 00:26:38.039 align:start position:0%
adoption of the amendment so we could
 
00:26:41.669 --> 00:26:41.679 align:start position:0%
have right these bills work concurrently
 
00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:44.320 align:start position:0%
um as they go over to the Senate thank
 
00:26:46.789 --> 00:26:46.799 align:start position:0%
you is there F any further discussion on
 
00:26:50.230 --> 00:26:50.240 align:start position:0%
uh OTP of
 
00:26:53.510 --> 00:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
1172 not not seeing any representative
 
00:26:55.470 --> 00:26:55.480 align:start position:0%
Stringham are you ready to call a
 
00:26:57.909 --> 00:26:57.919 align:start position:0%
vote representative Edwards I'm sorry I
 
00:26:59.190 --> 00:26:59.200 align:start position:0%
think that there was some consideration
 
00:27:00.669 --> 00:27:00.679 align:start position:0%
of the effective date of this amendment
 
00:27:01.870 --> 00:27:01.880 align:start position:0%
I just want to make sure the committee
 
00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:04.240 align:start position:0%
is comfortable with how it is the
 
00:27:07.470 --> 00:27:07.480 align:start position:0%
underlying bill is 1 January 2025 that
 
00:27:09.310 --> 00:27:09.320 align:start position:0%
that's correct that is an excellent
 
00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:12.240 align:start position:0%
observation because what this one didn't
 
00:27:14.269 --> 00:27:14.279 align:start position:0%
do was it didn't change the effective
 
00:27:18.750 --> 00:27:18.760 align:start position:0%
date to 1 July 25 and so right now OS is
 
00:27:21.230 --> 00:27:21.240 align:start position:0%
cooking another version that actually
 
00:27:24.830 --> 00:27:24.840 align:start position:0%
has it in the text and that was the one
 
00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:26.640 align:start position:0%
that just didn't make it today so we're
 
00:27:29.870 --> 00:27:29.880 align:start position:0%
using this 11 72 is a
 
00:27:33.070 --> 00:27:33.080 align:start position:0%
discussion so so I I don't I don't know
 
00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:34.470 align:start position:0%
discussion so so I I don't I don't know
that

00:27:34.470 --> 00:27:34.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:27:38.669 --> 00:27:38.679 align:start position:0%
uh I know we have a proper motion um but
 
00:27:40.870 --> 00:27:40.880 align:start position:0%
I would like to whoever made it to
 
00:27:42.630 --> 00:27:42.640 align:start position:0%
resend it because we don't really want
 
00:27:45.190 --> 00:27:45.200 align:start position:0%
to vote on 1172 we have an amendment
 
00:27:47.630 --> 00:27:47.640 align:start position:0%
coming to change the effective date go
 
00:27:50.190 --> 00:27:50.200 align:start position:0%
ahead how about I amend my motion to
 
00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:51.149 align:start position:0%
ahead how about I amend my motion to
adopt

00:27:51.149 --> 00:27:51.159 align:start position:0%
adopt
 
00:27:53.430 --> 00:27:53.440 align:start position:0%
1172 with the
 
00:27:56.149 --> 00:27:56.159 align:start position:0%
additional change to the effective date
 
00:27:59.549 --> 00:27:59.559 align:start position:0%
being July 1st 2025 I I I think that's
 
00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:02.880 align:start position:0%
acceptable who second it you second it
 
00:28:05.470 --> 00:28:05.480 align:start position:0%
okay so um so do you understand the
 
00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
motion uh represent string I do okay do
 
00:28:11.789 --> 00:28:11.799 align:start position:0%
you do you want to call a vote yeah so
 
00:28:17.830 --> 00:28:17.840 align:start position:0%
the the vote is on Amendment 1172 to HB
 
00:28:20.149 --> 00:28:20.159 align:start position:0%
1595 uh with the change of an
 
00:28:22.830 --> 00:28:22.840 align:start position:0%
implementation date of July 1
 
00:28:26.190 --> 00:28:26.200 align:start position:0%
2025 which may change the the amendment
 
00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:28.960 align:start position:0%
number uh but n unth less this vote
 
00:28:32.190 --> 00:28:32.200 align:start position:0%
would carry that so and the motion is
 
00:28:37.870 --> 00:28:37.880 align:start position:0%
ought to pass um representative Leon yes

revisit this you'll revisit it in the
 
00:29:41.110 --> 00:29:41.120 align:start position:0%

00:29:53.710 --> 00:29:53.720 align:start position:0%
representative tersi do you have like a
 
00:29:55.230 --> 00:29:55.240 align:start position:0%
sentence or two you want to share with
 
00:29:57.710 --> 00:29:57.720 align:start position:0%
us on on your your no I mean we've
 
00:29:59.710 --> 00:29:59.720 align:start position:0%
already voted but I I'm just curious if
 
00:30:04.990 --> 00:30:05.000 align:start position:0%
you have a concern that we should know
 
00:30:09.590 --> 00:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
about okay all right so who did we say
 
00:30:11.509 --> 00:30:11.519 align:start position:0%
is going to write that blurb I think we
 
00:30:14.350 --> 00:30:14.360 align:start position:0%
said that you
 
00:30:16.470 --> 00:30:16.480 align:start position:0%
will I don't think we I don't think we
 
00:30:19.310 --> 00:30:19.320 align:start position:0%
have a blur on an amendment am we have
 
00:30:22.990 --> 00:30:23.000 align:start position:0%
to vote on the bill okay all right so is
 
00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:26.760 align:start position:0%
there a motion on HB 1595 I'll move I
 
00:30:29.389 --> 00:30:29.399 align:start position:0%
move a to pass as as Amendment as
 
00:30:31.509 --> 00:30:31.519 align:start position:0%
amended with the amendment number to be
 
00:30:33.430 --> 00:30:33.440 align:start position:0%
determined based on the description we
 
00:30:36.710 --> 00:30:36.720 align:start position:0%
just had of 1172 plus a change of date
 
00:30:38.950 --> 00:30:38.960 align:start position:0%
okay um this there
 
00:30:41.389 --> 00:30:41.399 align:start position:0%
second second all
 
00:30:45.430 --> 00:30:45.440 align:start position:0%
right you ready for the vote um I guess
 
00:30:47.149 --> 00:30:47.159 align:start position:0%
I have a brief comment I don't know if
 
00:30:50.590 --> 00:30:50.600 align:start position:0%
anybody else does before voting um you
 
00:30:53.549 --> 00:30:53.559 align:start position:0%
know having having uh spoken
 
00:30:57.190 --> 00:30:57.200 align:start position:0%
to um Miss Hutchin and uh other
 
00:30:59.549 --> 00:30:59.559 align:start position:0%
Representatives and listening to the
 
00:31:02.350 --> 00:31:02.360 align:start position:0%
dialogue we've had here uh I do think
 
00:31:06.389 --> 00:31:06.399 align:start position:0%
there are um there are legitimate policy
 
00:31:09.350 --> 00:31:09.360 align:start position:0%
concerns about 1595 that led it to be a
 
00:31:12.350 --> 00:31:12.360 align:start position:0%
closer vote rather than the unanimous
 
00:31:15.830 --> 00:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
vote of of 15 um
 
00:31:20.110 --> 00:31:20.120 align:start position:0%
74 or 64 thank you uh those issues
 
00:31:22.909 --> 00:31:22.919 align:start position:0%
mainly mainly about whether the policy
 
00:31:28.029 --> 00:31:28.039 align:start position:0%
formula is Broad enough or not um um uh
 
00:31:31.549 --> 00:31:31.559 align:start position:0%
I um in my opinion that the bills can
 
00:31:33.990 --> 00:31:34.000 align:start position:0%
coexist if the policy for each is
 
00:31:37.509 --> 00:31:37.519 align:start position:0%
supported so I intend to support
 
00:31:40.549 --> 00:31:40.559 align:start position:0%
1595 and if there are are issues to be
 
00:31:43.870 --> 00:31:43.880 align:start position:0%
worked out I and uh uh you know there's
 
00:31:46.310 --> 00:31:46.320 align:start position:0%
still still concerns that uh that they
 
00:31:48.230 --> 00:31:48.240 align:start position:0%
be addressed in the Senate so I plan to
 
00:31:53.549 --> 00:31:53.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:56.509 --> 00:31:56.519 align:start position:0%
amended all right is there any further
 
00:32:00.950 --> 00:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
comment uh representative tki thank you
 
00:32:03.430 --> 00:32:03.440 align:start position:0%
um I think this is a very complicated
 
00:32:06.509 --> 00:32:06.519 align:start position:0%
issue I think that the work we've barely
 
00:32:10.269 --> 00:32:10.279 align:start position:0%
dug into demonstrates that um I would
 
00:32:13.190 --> 00:32:13.200 align:start position:0%
support a different motion preferably
 
00:32:16.509 --> 00:32:16.519 align:start position:0%
interim study that would allow um a
 
00:32:20.029 --> 00:32:20.039 align:start position:0%
little more in-depth understanding of um
 
00:32:22.230 --> 00:32:22.240 align:start position:0%
where this bill would actually bring us
 
00:32:23.509 --> 00:32:23.519 align:start position:0%
so unfortunately I'm going to be voting
 
00:32:25.230 --> 00:32:25.240 align:start position:0%
no on the motion that's on the floor
 
00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:26.029 align:start position:0%
no on the motion that's on the floor
right

00:32:26.029 --> 00:32:26.039 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:32:29.110 --> 00:32:29.120 align:start position:0%
now so so since you raised the
 
00:32:31.710 --> 00:32:31.720 align:start position:0%
conversation point of interim study is
 
00:32:34.190 --> 00:32:34.200 align:start position:0%
there anyone else who's thinking interim
 
00:32:36.590 --> 00:32:36.600 align:start position:0%
study as opposed to an
 
00:32:39.669 --> 00:32:39.679 align:start position:0%
otpa I mean we have the motion of otpa
 
00:32:41.789 --> 00:32:41.799 align:start position:0%
but we're just
 
00:32:46.470 --> 00:32:46.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:48.669 --> 00:32:48.679 align:start position:0%
comment I have I really don't have a
 
00:32:50.070 --> 00:32:50.080 align:start position:0%
comment at this point other than I would
 
00:32:53.110 --> 00:32:53.120 align:start position:0%
support a to pass because I do interim
 
00:32:55.909 --> 00:32:55.919 align:start position:0%
study I'm sorry um you know I do think
 
00:32:59.789 --> 00:32:59.799 align:start position:0%
there it's complicated and it's we're
 
00:33:01.990 --> 00:33:02.000 align:start position:0%
talking about policy all of this is
 
00:33:06.350 --> 00:33:06.360 align:start position:0%
policy and um not the not the financial
 
00:33:09.549 --> 00:33:09.559 align:start position:0%
part of the bill and um for that reason
 
00:33:11.269 --> 00:33:11.279 align:start position:0%
I just think we
 
00:33:13.590 --> 00:33:13.600 align:start position:0%
should leave it for interm study and
 
00:33:16.870 --> 00:33:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:18.950 --> 00:33:18.960 align:start position:0%
it anyone else thinking that
 
00:33:20.909 --> 00:33:20.919 align:start position:0%
representative all your light us on it
 
00:33:24.669 --> 00:33:24.679 align:start position:0%
is thank you um in term it is policy and
 
00:33:27.310 --> 00:33:27.320 align:start position:0%
at some level some of this directly
 
00:33:29.430 --> 00:33:29.440 align:start position:0%
impacts the court costs and although
 
00:33:33.430 --> 00:33:33.440 align:start position:0%
this is division three if we can leave
 
00:33:36.310 --> 00:33:36.320 align:start position:0%
um a policy in place that has reasonable
 
00:33:38.750 --> 00:33:38.760 align:start position:0%
math rules to allow judges to make
 
00:33:40.750 --> 00:33:40.760 align:start position:0%
decisions we should theoretically
 
00:33:42.310 --> 00:33:42.320 align:start position:0%
shorten the amount of time spent in the
 
00:33:43.830 --> 00:33:43.840 align:start position:0%
courtroom which could be advantageous
 
00:33:46.230 --> 00:33:46.240 align:start position:0%
financially so yet one more reason why
 
00:33:49.110 --> 00:33:49.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:52.110 --> 00:33:52.120 align:start position:0%
AAS any other further conversation on
 
00:33:55.789 --> 00:33:55.799 align:start position:0%
otpa or thoughts on is interm
 
00:33:59.470 --> 00:33:59.480 align:start position:0%
study not not not any um are you ready
 
00:34:00.669 --> 00:34:00.679 align:start position:0%
for a
 
00:34:04.710 --> 00:34:04.720 align:start position:0%
vote yep so this is a vote on U House
 
00:34:07.990 --> 00:34:08.000 align:start position:0%

00:34:57.710 --> 00:34:57.720 align:start position:0%
part to you chairman about the Okay so
 
00:35:01.349 --> 00:35:01.359 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to close 1595 and thank you
 
00:35:05.150 --> 00:35:05.160 align:start position:0%
for all your work um appreciate it uh
 
00:35:07.109 --> 00:35:07.119 align:start position:0%
obviously this is not done it's got to
 
00:35:08.870 --> 00:35:08.880 align:start position:0%
go to the full finance committee the
 
00:35:11.950 --> 00:35:11.960 align:start position:0%
house and the Senate so so the steeple
 
00:35:17.390 --> 00:35:17.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:20.390 --> 00:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
you uh turn on your mic
 
00:35:23.710 --> 00:35:23.720 align:start position:0%
on thank you I I wanted to ask about the
 
00:35:26.349 --> 00:35:26.359 align:start position:0%
fiscal note does this change I mean does
 
00:35:29.109 --> 00:35:29.119 align:start position:0%
it come up become a zero or or because
 
00:35:31.710 --> 00:35:31.720 align:start position:0%
the other one's already gone through so
 
00:35:33.829 --> 00:35:33.839 align:start position:0%
you have so I'm going to lean on Mickey
 
00:35:37.069 --> 00:35:37.079 align:start position:0%
but what I think happens is um the an
 
00:35:40.750 --> 00:35:40.760 align:start position:0%
official fiscal note doesn't get updated
 
00:35:43.430 --> 00:35:43.440 align:start position:0%
until the house passes
 
00:35:46.030 --> 00:35:46.040 align:start position:0%
it that that's what I think happens is
 
00:35:47.750 --> 00:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
that is that close that's correct that's
 
00:35:50.150 --> 00:35:50.160 align:start position:0%
correct okay all right so don't ask me
 
00:35:53.790 --> 00:35:53.800 align:start position:0%
any more questions I got one in a row so
 
00:35:56.470 --> 00:35:56.480 align:start position:0%

that would be great thank
 
00:36:35.790 --> 00:36:35.800 align:start position:0%
you okay uh represent priest uh before
 
00:36:41.150 --> 00:36:41.160 align:start position:0%
um the witnesses or testimonies leave I
 
00:36:44.950 --> 00:36:44.960 align:start position:0%
I would have a question for you where in
 
00:36:48.630 --> 00:36:48.640 align:start position:0%
1564 does it discuss the cases of
 
00:36:52.670 --> 00:36:52.680 align:start position:0%
domestic abuse so if you look at the um
 
00:36:58.270 --> 00:36:58.280 align:start position:0%
the chart that I sent over um RSA 45 8
 
00:37:02.349 --> 00:37:02.359 align:start position:0%
C5 is where you see uh that section um
 
00:37:04.230 --> 00:37:04.240 align:start position:0%
about domestic violence it's at the end
 
00:37:08.030 --> 00:37:08.040 align:start position:0%
of page two um I'm G to I don't have it
 
00:37:09.630 --> 00:37:09.640 align:start position:0%
in front of me but the line numbers on
 
00:37:11.270 --> 00:37:11.280 align:start position:0%
my chart tell me that it's probably
 
00:37:19.109 --> 00:37:19.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:22.990 --> 00:37:23.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:25.990 --> 00:37:26.000 align:start position:0%
you all right uh with that I I think we
 
00:37:28.750 --> 00:37:28.760 align:start position:0%
can completely change subjects and I'm
 
00:37:36.750 --> 00:37:36.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:39.950 --> 00:37:39.960 align:start position:0%
1282 do we do we have anyone here who
 
00:37:44.230 --> 00:37:44.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:47.150 --> 00:37:47.160 align:start position:0%
1282 this is relative to the duration of
 
00:37:49.750 --> 00:37:49.760 align:start position:0%
child support in our previous work
 
00:37:52.710 --> 00:37:52.720 align:start position:0%
sessions there really hasn't been any
 
00:37:56.109 --> 00:37:56.119 align:start position:0%
controversy on this um so I don't know
 
00:37:58.390 --> 00:37:58.400 align:start position:0%
that we need to discuss it for further
 
00:38:01.470 --> 00:38:01.480 align:start position:0%
today uh I I would be willing to
 
00:38:05.470 --> 00:38:05.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:08.750 --> 00:38:08.760 align:start position:0%
motion a brief question go ahead I'm
 
00:38:11.109 --> 00:38:11.119 align:start position:0%
looking at my notes here and I think it
 
00:38:13.030 --> 00:38:13.040 align:start position:0%
says the effective date also needed to
 
00:38:15.510 --> 00:38:15.520 align:start position:0%
change did we have an amendment for that
 
00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:17.200 align:start position:0%
that I'm
 
00:38:26.430 --> 00:38:26.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:28.109 align:start position:0%
 
us

00:38:28.109 --> 00:38:28.119 align:start position:0%
us
 
00:38:31.309 --> 00:38:31.319 align:start position:0%
uh I as I look at my notes yeah there
 
00:38:34.630 --> 00:38:34.640 align:start position:0%
was uh an amendment that got triggered
 
00:38:37.230 --> 00:38:37.240 align:start position:0%
because we were told it take six months
 
00:38:39.270 --> 00:38:39.280 align:start position:0%
to do the contract and six months to
 
00:38:43.550 --> 00:38:43.560 align:start position:0%
implement it and and uh I I I don't I
 
00:38:47.870 --> 00:38:47.880 align:start position:0%
don't uh recall ever hearing anything or
 
00:38:49.990 --> 00:38:50.000 align:start position:0%
asking Mr Ripple to generate the
 
00:38:53.710 --> 00:38:53.720 align:start position:0%
amendment though so
 
00:38:56.990 --> 00:38:57.000 align:start position:0%
um so I do think that that would be
 
00:38:59.750 --> 00:38:59.760 align:start position:0%
reasonable to get the amendment all
 
00:39:02.309 --> 00:39:02.319 align:start position:0%
right would you like me to do that or
 
00:39:04.670 --> 00:39:04.680 align:start position:0%
can someone else draft it so not not of
 
00:39:06.870 --> 00:39:06.880 align:start position:0%
being here at the previous work session
 
00:39:09.109 --> 00:39:09.119 align:start position:0%
the bill as introduced had an effective
 
00:39:11.790 --> 00:39:11.800 align:start position:0%
date of 60 days after passage it looks
 
00:39:13.150 --> 00:39:13.160 align:start position:0%
like the amendment out of the policy
 
00:39:14.870 --> 00:39:14.880 align:start position:0%
committee changed the effective date to
 
00:39:17.630 --> 00:39:17.640 align:start position:0%
1 January 25 so it's possible I don't
 
00:39:20.270 --> 00:39:20.280 align:start position:0%
know if that triggered any recollection
 
00:39:22.950 --> 00:39:22.960 align:start position:0%
I think we were looking at one July 25
 
00:39:24.790 --> 00:39:24.800 align:start position:0%
yes so I I do not have any amendments
 
00:39:26.230 --> 00:39:26.240 align:start position:0%
for this bill just so everyone's aware
 
00:39:31.270 --> 00:39:31.280 align:start position:0%
of that so can you ask for one
 
00:39:33.390 --> 00:39:33.400 align:start position:0%
um can we still do the same thing and
 
00:39:35.630 --> 00:39:35.640 align:start position:0%
vote on it with that modification I'm
 
00:39:37.230 --> 00:39:37.240 align:start position:0%
okay with that because it's still got to
 
00:39:39.950 --> 00:39:39.960 align:start position:0%
go to the finance committee so we've got
 
00:39:42.670 --> 00:39:42.680 align:start position:0%
some a fallback we're operating with a
 
00:39:45.309 --> 00:39:45.319 align:start position:0%
net here so I I'm okay with that is
 
00:39:48.430 --> 00:39:48.440 align:start position:0%
there any objection to going ahead and
 
00:39:51.030 --> 00:39:51.040 align:start position:0%
and U discussing this considering a vote
 
00:39:53.829 --> 00:39:53.839 align:start position:0%
knowing that we want the amendment to
 
00:39:56.150 --> 00:39:56.160 align:start position:0%
reflect one July 25 for the
 
00:39:58.230 --> 00:39:58.240 align:start position:0%
implementation date
 
00:40:00.109 --> 00:40:00.119 align:start position:0%
effective date
 
00:40:02.829 --> 00:40:02.839 align:start position:0%
rather okay I'm not I'm not seeing
 
00:40:05.390 --> 00:40:05.400 align:start position:0%
anyone objecting to that was there was

discussion I'm I'm not seeing any are
 
00:40:44.030 --> 00:40:44.040 align:start position:0%
you ready for a vote could I just ask a
 
00:40:45.309 --> 00:40:45.319 align:start position:0%
question to make sure we do this the
 
00:40:46.990 --> 00:40:47.000 align:start position:0%
right way go ahead should we also vote
 
00:40:48.710 --> 00:40:48.720 align:start position:0%

00:40:51.870 --> 00:40:51.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:54.910 --> 00:40:54.920 align:start position:0%
otpa again not sure how division 3 te
 
00:40:56.790 --> 00:40:56.800 align:start position:0%
technically runs you know in the past
 
00:41:04.670 --> 00:41:04.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:06.950 --> 00:41:06.960 align:start position:0%
suspenders show a hands how many are
 
00:41:09.550 --> 00:41:09.560 align:start position:0%
willing to okay so we're all in favor of
 
00:41:12.270 --> 00:41:12.280 align:start position:0%
that and and so this would turn out to
 
00:41:16.309 --> 00:41:16.319 align:start position:0%

00:42:04.109 --> 00:42:04.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:09.829 --> 00:42:09.839 align:start position:0%
okay um and uh from where you're
 
00:42:13.790 --> 00:42:13.800 align:start position:0%
sitting um why don't you just uh with we
 
00:42:16.230 --> 00:42:16.240 align:start position:0%
don't have a motion yet so but because
 
00:42:18.030 --> 00:42:18.040 align:start position:0%
no one knows what your Amendment says
 
00:42:20.309 --> 00:42:20.319 align:start position:0%
why don't why don't you talk to us about
 
00:42:21.950 --> 00:42:21.960 align:start position:0%
what you think your Amendment does to
 
00:42:25.630 --> 00:42:25.640 align:start position:0%
the underlying bill um thank you so um
 
00:42:28.230 --> 00:42:28.240 align:start position:0%
with this bill um and currently says the
 
00:42:29.829 --> 00:42:29.839 align:start position:0%
department shall not share this
 
00:42:31.589 --> 00:42:31.599 align:start position:0%
personally identifiable information
 
00:42:33.589 --> 00:42:33.599 align:start position:0%
unless the department is able to ensure
 
00:42:36.349 --> 00:42:36.359 align:start position:0%
the withdrawals the amendment changes it
 
00:42:38.470 --> 00:42:38.480 align:start position:0%
to say that prior to entering into an
 
00:42:39.950 --> 00:42:39.960 align:start position:0%
agreement to share personally
 
00:42:42.750 --> 00:42:42.760 align:start position:0%
identifiable information um the
 
00:42:45.030 --> 00:42:45.040 align:start position:0%
department shall ensure that withdrawals
 
00:42:47.430 --> 00:42:47.440 align:start position:0%
will be honored so the the point with
 
00:42:49.390 --> 00:42:49.400 align:start position:0%
this is that whether or not that money
 
00:42:51.230 --> 00:42:51.240 align:start position:0%
is available this year this would make
 
00:42:53.829 --> 00:42:53.839 align:start position:0%
it so that that needs to happen before
 
00:42:56.349 --> 00:42:56.359 align:start position:0%
anything is shared um that would be able
 
00:42:58.510 --> 00:42:58.520 align:start position:0%
to remove any fiscal impact from this
 
00:43:02.470 --> 00:43:02.480 align:start position:0%
bill uh because there's there as far as
 
00:43:04.870 --> 00:43:04.880 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm aware there are no current plans
 
00:43:07.230 --> 00:43:07.240 align:start position:0%
in order to share that information and
 
00:43:08.870 --> 00:43:08.880 align:start position:0%
since there are no current plans to
 
00:43:11.150 --> 00:43:11.160 align:start position:0%
share that information the question is
 
00:43:13.230 --> 00:43:13.240 align:start position:0%
whether or not the funds are available
 
00:43:15.549 --> 00:43:15.559 align:start position:0%
in order to spend the money to update
 
00:43:19.230 --> 00:43:19.240 align:start position:0%
the system to allow that data to comply
 
00:43:21.630 --> 00:43:21.640 align:start position:0%
with our other existing laws prior to it
 
00:43:23.910 --> 00:43:23.920 align:start position:0%
being shared so it's simply a matter of
 
00:43:25.750 --> 00:43:25.760 align:start position:0%
whether or not we want to allocate the
 
00:43:27.790 --> 00:43:27.800 align:start position:0%
money for somebody to
 
00:43:30.430 --> 00:43:30.440 align:start position:0%
um be able to update the database now or
 
00:43:31.510 --> 00:43:31.520 align:start position:0%
if that's something that we would look
 
00:43:33.349 --> 00:43:33.359 align:start position:0%
to do in the new budget cycle because
 
00:43:36.270 --> 00:43:36.280 align:start position:0%
there is no pending um pending agreement
 
00:43:38.630 --> 00:43:38.640 align:start position:0%
to share those data so this allows the
 
00:43:41.589 --> 00:43:41.599 align:start position:0%
flexibility that we would need so may I
 
00:43:44.230 --> 00:43:44.240 align:start position:0%
clarify yes okay so we're talking about
 
00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:45.950 align:start position:0%
clarify yes okay so we're talking about
Amendment

00:43:45.950 --> 00:43:45.960 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
00:43:50.790 --> 00:43:50.800 align:start position:0%
1073 correct and the operative change of
 
00:43:53.750 --> 00:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
the word to shall is that on line seven
 
00:43:56.190 --> 00:43:56.200 align:start position:0%
the department shall uh so the operative
 
00:43:57.670 --> 00:43:57.680 align:start position:0%
changes are
 
00:43:59.630 --> 00:43:59.640 align:start position:0%
um on line five
 
00:44:02.349 --> 00:44:02.359 align:start position:0%
the from prior to entering into an
 
00:44:05.150 --> 00:44:05.160 align:start position:0%
agreement two replaces the words the
 
00:44:07.670 --> 00:44:07.680 align:start position:0%
department shall not and then when you
 
00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:10.030 align:start position:0%
department shall not and then when you
get

00:44:10.030 --> 00:44:10.040 align:start position:0%
get
 
00:44:13.710 --> 00:44:13.720 align:start position:0%
to immunization systems um at the very
 
00:44:16.069 --> 00:44:16.079 align:start position:0%
beginning of line seven it previously
 
00:44:17.990 --> 00:44:18.000 align:start position:0%
said unless the department is able to
 
00:44:20.069 --> 00:44:20.079 align:start position:0%
assure that withdrawals under paragraph
 
00:44:22.910 --> 00:44:22.920 align:start position:0%
3A now it says that that they shall
 
00:44:26.030 --> 00:44:26.040 align:start position:0%
ensure the withdrawals so instead of um
 
00:44:27.589 --> 00:44:27.599 align:start position:0%
instead of saying that the department
 
00:44:30.390 --> 00:44:30.400 align:start position:0%
shall not unless it says prior to an
 
00:44:33.390 --> 00:44:33.400 align:start position:0%
enter entering an agreement they
 
00:44:37.230 --> 00:44:37.240 align:start position:0%
shall okay and do you recall uh what how
 
00:44:38.950 --> 00:44:38.960 align:start position:0%
you were on the committee so do you
 
00:44:43.069 --> 00:44:43.079 align:start position:0%
recall what 1669 how uh HHS looked at
 
00:44:45.470 --> 00:44:45.480 align:start position:0%
this from a policy perspective um I will
 
00:44:46.950 --> 00:44:46.960 align:start position:0%
confirm but I'm pretty certain that it
 
00:44:49.870 --> 00:44:49.880 align:start position:0%
was on the consent calendar okay and
 
00:44:51.829 --> 00:44:51.839 align:start position:0%
what you think this amendment does is it
 
00:44:54.349 --> 00:44:54.359 align:start position:0%
removes the fiscal impact um it leaves
 
00:44:55.710 --> 00:44:55.720 align:start position:0%
that to be more of a choice as to
 
00:44:57.589 --> 00:44:57.599 align:start position:0%
whether it wants to be funded but yes
 
00:44:59.150 --> 00:44:59.160 align:start position:0%
that way if the funds aren't available
 
00:45:00.790 --> 00:45:00.800 align:start position:0%
this year we still have it into law that
 
00:45:02.990 --> 00:45:03.000 align:start position:0%
it's necessary and we'll know that it's
 
00:45:05.790 --> 00:45:05.800 align:start position:0%
it'll be necessary to um pay for that
 
00:45:08.549 --> 00:45:08.559 align:start position:0%
prior to sharing our information okay so
 
00:45:10.470 --> 00:45:10.480 align:start position:0%
we're in the part of the discussion
 
00:45:12.030 --> 00:45:12.040 align:start position:0%
where we're all trying to understand the
 
00:45:13.470 --> 00:45:13.480 align:start position:0%
amendment and the underlying Bill
 
00:45:15.270 --> 00:45:15.280 align:start position:0%
representative tki thank you I have a
 
00:45:17.470 --> 00:45:17.480 align:start position:0%
question perhaps Mr White could chime in
 
00:45:19.270 --> 00:45:19.280 align:start position:0%
on his interpretation of the amendment
 
00:45:20.829 --> 00:45:20.839 align:start position:0%
and what it means
 
00:45:25.069 --> 00:45:25.079 align:start position:0%
for the future the future fiscal future
 
00:45:27.750 --> 00:45:27.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal okay if
 
00:45:29.829 --> 00:45:29.839 align:start position:0%
what monies May pay for that if we're
 
00:45:32.910 --> 00:45:32.920 align:start position:0%
going to have to dig for that but just a
 
00:45:34.150 --> 00:45:34.160 align:start position:0%
little clarification on their
 
00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:35.750 align:start position:0%
little clarification on their
interpretation

00:45:35.750 --> 00:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
interpretation
 
00:45:38.589 --> 00:45:38.599 align:start position:0%
thanks you can you can grab a mic at the
 
00:45:44.630 --> 00:45:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:47.109 --> 00:45:47.119 align:start position:0%
White hi uh good afternoon I'm Abby
 
00:45:49.030 --> 00:45:49.040 align:start position:0%
Rogers uh legislative lays on division
 
00:45:51.349 --> 00:45:51.359 align:start position:0%
of Public Health Services and I'm me and
 
00:45:53.270 --> 00:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
Marie mcui I'm the immunization section
 
00:45:55.870 --> 00:45:55.880 align:start position:0%
chief thank you um so I think that one
 
00:45:57.190 --> 00:45:57.200 align:start position:0%
of the things that we just want to
 
00:45:59.430 --> 00:45:59.440 align:start position:0%
clarify is that um we would not be
 
00:46:01.270 --> 00:46:01.280 align:start position:0%
entering into agreement with any other
 
00:46:04.309 --> 00:46:04.319 align:start position:0%
state to share until we had dialogues
 
00:46:06.829 --> 00:46:06.839 align:start position:0%
with the other states to really kind of
 
00:46:08.349 --> 00:46:08.359 align:start position:0%
understand their ability to comply with
 
00:46:11.710 --> 00:46:11.720 align:start position:0%
any terms um that has been uh put
 
00:46:14.470 --> 00:46:14.480 align:start position:0%
forward with legal consultation um but
 
00:46:16.270 --> 00:46:16.280 align:start position:0%
we would need to have the system
 
00:46:18.069 --> 00:46:18.079 align:start position:0%
upgraded before entering into the
 
00:46:19.710 --> 00:46:19.720 align:start position:0%
agreement so that would be very
 
00:46:22.109 --> 00:46:22.119 align:start position:0%
important to know that that money's um
 
00:46:23.990 --> 00:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
those funds would need to be available
 
00:46:26.549 --> 00:46:26.559 align:start position:0%
prior to entering into those agreements
 
00:46:28.109 --> 00:46:28.119 align:start position:0%
um because because it would be uh
 
00:46:30.549 --> 00:46:30.559 align:start position:0%
unreasonable for us to proceed forward
 
00:46:32.910 --> 00:46:32.920 align:start position:0%
with an agreement say with Vermont um
 
00:46:35.069 --> 00:46:35.079 align:start position:0%
when we then have to turn around and say
 
00:46:36.750 --> 00:46:36.760 align:start position:0%
it's going to take us six to nine months
 
00:46:39.470 --> 00:46:39.480 align:start position:0%
to upgrade our system and uh we're going
 
00:46:41.109 --> 00:46:41.119 align:start position:0%
to have to put you on hold even though
 
00:46:43.390 --> 00:46:43.400 align:start position:0%
we have this agreement in
 
00:46:46.790 --> 00:46:46.800 align:start position:0%
inforced so so this I guess this will
 
00:46:49.030 --> 00:46:49.040 align:start position:0%
end up with Mr White but it's my
 
00:46:52.230 --> 00:46:52.240 align:start position:0%
recollection that we funded this this
 
00:46:54.870 --> 00:46:54.880 align:start position:0%
system in the prior budget that the that
 
00:46:57.990 --> 00:46:58.000 align:start position:0%
the money to implement a an immunization
 
00:47:01.150 --> 00:47:01.160 align:start position:0%
system is already in the budget is is
 
00:47:02.589 --> 00:47:02.599 align:start position:0%
that false or
 
00:47:05.750 --> 00:47:05.760 align:start position:0%
true that that my understanding is that
 
00:47:08.549 --> 00:47:08.559 align:start position:0%
is that's true but but as far as system
 
00:47:11.349 --> 00:47:11.359 align:start position:0%
change requirements go um this would be
 
00:47:12.910 --> 00:47:12.920 align:start position:0%
the enhancement so similar to the past
 
00:47:14.510 --> 00:47:14.520 align:start position:0%
two bills where there's a $100,000
 
00:47:16.990 --> 00:47:17.000 align:start position:0%
general fund impact for the system
 
00:47:19.510 --> 00:47:19.520 align:start position:0%
requirements this would be similar I I I
 
00:47:21.510 --> 00:47:21.520 align:start position:0%
haven't seen the updated Amendment
 
00:47:24.990 --> 00:47:25.000 align:start position:0%
language um but but I I would ultimately
 
00:47:27.109 --> 00:47:27.119 align:start position:0%
defer to Dave weers on what the full and
 
00:47:29.790 --> 00:47:29.800 align:start position:0%
final impact would
 
00:47:32.990 --> 00:47:33.000 align:start position:0%
be all right I I can't imagine it to be
 
00:47:36.510 --> 00:47:36.520 align:start position:0%
very conse consequential distinction
 
00:47:39.670 --> 00:47:39.680 align:start position:0%
from the underlying bill because the two
 
00:47:42.109 --> 00:47:42.119 align:start position:0%
changes that I've heard representative
 
00:47:47.549 --> 00:47:47.559 align:start position:0%
Leon uh Leon say uh don't seem to
 
00:47:50.270 --> 00:47:50.280 align:start position:0%
substantively change what we're wanting
 
00:47:52.790 --> 00:47:52.800 align:start position:0%
to do we're just clarifying the right
 
00:47:54.870 --> 00:47:54.880 align:start position:0%
words to say what we want to do so I
 
00:47:57.069 --> 00:47:57.079 align:start position:0%
don't with this amendment I don't see
 
00:48:00.030 --> 00:48:00.040 align:start position:0%
any change from the underlying 1669
 
00:48:02.910 --> 00:48:02.920 align:start position:0%
would would you agree or disagree Mr I I
 
00:48:04.270 --> 00:48:04.280 align:start position:0%
haven't seen a copy of the amendment so
 
00:48:07.430 --> 00:48:07.440 align:start position:0%
I can't speak to it oh okay well he's
 
00:48:08.790 --> 00:48:08.800 align:start position:0%
looking at that ask a procedural
 
00:48:11.109 --> 00:48:11.119 align:start position:0%
question uh yes sir I note that this has
 
00:48:12.589 --> 00:48:12.599 align:start position:0%
representative lon's name on it and I
 
00:48:14.190 --> 00:48:14.200 align:start position:0%
don't believe that can count we'll have
 
00:48:15.390 --> 00:48:15.400 align:start position:0%
to have another amendment drawn up I
 
00:48:16.790 --> 00:48:16.800 align:start position:0%
think with with your name on it or
 
00:48:18.990 --> 00:48:19.000 align:start position:0%
somebody's name from the committee
 
00:48:21.190 --> 00:48:21.200 align:start position:0%
correct you know we we're going to see a
 
00:48:23.150 --> 00:48:23.160 align:start position:0%
Pearson Amendment later so this is a
 
00:48:26.790 --> 00:48:26.800 align:start position:0%
good conversation I can we accept an
 
00:48:29.549 --> 00:48:29.559 align:start position:0%
Amendment within finance that does not
 
00:48:32.430 --> 00:48:32.440 align:start position:0%
have a permanent Finance person on the
 
00:48:34.829 --> 00:48:34.839 align:start position:0%
named I think typically the practice is
 
00:48:36.069 --> 00:48:36.079 align:start position:0%
we would switch it over to a house
 
00:48:38.390 --> 00:48:38.400 align:start position:0%
finance member's name at some point so
 
00:48:39.670 --> 00:48:39.680 align:start position:0%
uh whether that's between here and the
 
00:48:41.589 --> 00:48:41.599 align:start position:0%
full Committee just to redraft it with a
 
00:48:43.990 --> 00:48:44.000 align:start position:0%
sponsor that's on on house
 
00:48:47.069 --> 00:48:47.079 align:start position:0%
finance how how are we doing on on
 
00:48:49.390 --> 00:48:49.400 align:start position:0%
effective dates we don't did we did is
 
00:48:51.670 --> 00:48:51.680 align:start position:0%
this one that we wanted to talk about an
 
00:48:53.750 --> 00:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
effective date up
 
00:48:56.470 --> 00:48:56.480 align:start position:0%
modification and did we do that no in
 
00:48:58.309 --> 00:48:58.319 align:start position:0%
this case we want it to be 60 days
 
00:49:02.750 --> 00:49:02.760 align:start position:0%
because this is a higher level policy
 
00:49:05.470 --> 00:49:05.480 align:start position:0%
that ensures that that we're not sharing
 
00:49:07.510 --> 00:49:07.520 align:start position:0%
the data okay is this just an
 
00:49:09.829 --> 00:49:09.839 align:start position:0%
administrative thing where we go to ol
 
00:49:12.510 --> 00:49:12.520 align:start position:0%
Mickey to OS and just say hey change the
 
00:49:14.829 --> 00:49:14.839 align:start position:0%
name of the of that Amendment without
 
00:49:16.589 --> 00:49:16.599 align:start position:0%
changing the number or anything the
 
00:49:19.150 --> 00:49:19.160 align:start position:0%
number will change but we can redraft it
 
00:49:21.069 --> 00:49:21.079 align:start position:0%
with the content identical of course
 
00:49:23.630 --> 00:49:23.640 align:start position:0%
with just the change in the sponsor okay
 
00:49:25.309 --> 00:49:25.319 align:start position:0%
does anyone love this amendment that
 
00:49:27.309 --> 00:49:27.319 align:start position:0%
they want their name on it
 
00:49:30.870 --> 00:49:30.880 align:start position:0%
uh I I'm I I love this amendment I love
 
00:49:33.589 --> 00:49:33.599 align:start position:0%
this amendment put it under
 
00:49:36.549 --> 00:49:36.559 align:start position:0%
both okay put put the representative
 
00:49:38.549 --> 00:49:38.559 align:start position:0%
hole on it because he doesn't agree with
 
00:49:40.750 --> 00:49:40.760 align:start position:0%
us very often so
 
00:49:44.789 --> 00:49:44.799 align:start position:0%
let's let's make
 
00:49:44.799 --> 00:49:46.430 align:start position:0%
let's let's make
he

00:49:46.430 --> 00:49:46.440 align:start position:0%
he
 
00:49:49.030 --> 00:49:49.040 align:start position:0%
um all right
 
00:49:52.150 --> 00:49:52.160 align:start position:0%
um so is there is there understanding of
 
00:49:53.789 --> 00:49:53.799 align:start position:0%
this underlying Amendment we haven't
 
00:49:55.670 --> 00:49:55.680 align:start position:0%
really discussed whether we like it or
 
00:49:57.270 --> 00:49:57.280 align:start position:0%
not yet but
 
00:49:59.549 --> 00:49:59.559 align:start position:0%
do do you have more to say go ahead um I
 
00:50:02.510 --> 00:50:02.520 align:start position:0%
guess my one question would be that um
 
00:50:04.549 --> 00:50:04.559 align:start position:0%
do you see that this would prohibit you
 
00:50:06.390 --> 00:50:06.400 align:start position:0%
from making this change if the funds
 
00:50:08.589 --> 00:50:08.599 align:start position:0%
were available um that you could still
 
00:50:11.069 --> 00:50:11.079 align:start position:0%
proceed the same way with this language
 
00:50:13.190 --> 00:50:13.200 align:start position:0%
um it's just would allow you to press
 
00:50:15.470 --> 00:50:15.480 align:start position:0%
push it out if there was any funding
 
00:50:17.630 --> 00:50:17.640 align:start position:0%
issues um I don't think that we have an
 
00:50:19.390 --> 00:50:19.400 align:start position:0%
issue with the language as long as the
 
00:50:20.910 --> 00:50:20.920 align:start position:0%
intention is that we would have the
 
00:50:24.230 --> 00:50:24.240 align:start position:0%
funds to develop the the enhancement
 
00:50:28.390 --> 00:50:28.400 align:start position:0%
prior to entering into that agreement
 
00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:29.670 align:start position:0%
prior to entering into that agreement
thank

00:50:29.670 --> 00:50:29.680 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:50:32.390 --> 00:50:32.400 align:start position:0%
you I I want to see if Mr White has a
 
00:50:34.870 --> 00:50:34.880 align:start position:0%
comment yet on okay go ahead represent
 
00:50:36.589 --> 00:50:36.599 align:start position:0%
hle I'm not sure who in the department
 
00:50:40.710 --> 00:50:40.720 align:start position:0%
to answer this on on line five PR prior
 
00:50:43.710 --> 00:50:43.720 align:start position:0%
to entering into any agreement it's my
 
00:50:45.030 --> 00:50:45.040 align:start position:0%
understanding agreement is in the
 
00:50:47.829 --> 00:50:47.839 align:start position:0%
broadest sense of the word meaning memor
 
00:50:49.750 --> 00:50:49.760 align:start position:0%
memorandum of understanding the entire
 
00:50:51.589 --> 00:50:51.599 align:start position:0%
list of potential words that would fall
 
00:50:53.349 --> 00:50:53.359 align:start position:0%
under agreement is that the same
 
00:50:55.470 --> 00:50:55.480 align:start position:0%
understanding that you guys have that is
 
00:51:04.349 --> 00:51:04.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:06.829 --> 00:51:06.839 align:start position:0%
anou represent
 
00:51:09.750 --> 00:51:09.760 align:start position:0%
priest thank you Mr chairman again from
 
00:51:13.990 --> 00:51:14.000 align:start position:0%
my understanding this um the previous
 
00:51:17.109 --> 00:51:17.119 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact report stated that there
 
00:51:19.230 --> 00:51:19.240 align:start position:0%
was a
 
00:51:19.240 --> 00:51:21.109 align:start position:0%
was a
3.2

00:51:21.109 --> 00:51:21.119 align:start position:0%
3.2
 
00:51:24.470 --> 00:51:24.480 align:start position:0%
million that was needed at the beginning
 
00:51:26.910 --> 00:51:26.920 align:start position:0%
is this the enhancement or is this the
 
00:51:37.190 --> 00:51:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:39.510 --> 00:51:39.520 align:start position:0%
upgraded I'd like to defer to
 
00:51:42.549 --> 00:51:42.559 align:start position:0%
representative L please um thank you
 
00:51:44.829 --> 00:51:44.839 align:start position:0%
there was an amendment adopted in the
 
00:51:46.150 --> 00:51:46.160 align:start position:0%
policy committee Health and Human
 
00:51:48.470 --> 00:51:48.480 align:start position:0%
Services initially the bill had been
 
00:51:50.349 --> 00:51:50.359 align:start position:0%
introduced where a person could choose
 
00:51:52.829 --> 00:51:52.839 align:start position:0%
to share the information and by being
 
00:51:55.069 --> 00:51:55.079 align:start position:0%
able to do that and track where it went
 
00:51:56.950 --> 00:51:56.960 align:start position:0%
that what brought in the 3 million
 
00:51:58.950 --> 00:51:58.960 align:start position:0%
charge we removed that because I thought
 
00:52:00.470 --> 00:52:00.480 align:start position:0%
that it would be a nice benefit to be
 
00:52:02.150 --> 00:52:02.160 align:start position:0%
able to allow people to share that but
 
00:52:03.870 --> 00:52:03.880 align:start position:0%
their immunization records are their own
 
00:52:05.109 --> 00:52:05.119 align:start position:0%
and they can share that from their
 
00:52:07.030 --> 00:52:07.040 align:start position:0%
existing medical record I over
 
00:52:08.589 --> 00:52:08.599 align:start position:0%
complicated things to the cost of $3
 
00:52:10.870 --> 00:52:10.880 align:start position:0%
million and we fixed that in Health and
 
00:52:12.430 --> 00:52:12.440 align:start position:0%
Human Services before it went to the
 
00:52:14.789 --> 00:52:14.799 align:start position:0%
floor and uh I had wanted to make a note
 
00:52:16.069 --> 00:52:16.079 align:start position:0%
because I realized that it didn't have
 
00:52:18.990 --> 00:52:19.000 align:start position:0%
an updated uh fiscal impact fiscal note
 
00:52:21.670 --> 00:52:21.680 align:start position:0%
on there and it is $3 million less now
 
00:52:24.470 --> 00:52:24.480 align:start position:0%
um yeah there is a new
 
00:52:27.230 --> 00:52:27.240 align:start position:0%
note there is a new note which has it at
 
00:52:31.470 --> 00:52:31.480 align:start position:0%
$61,000 $181,000 in 2025 100,000 in 26
 
00:52:31.480 --> 00:52:34.990 align:start position:0%
$61,000 $181,000 in 2025 100,000 in 26
and

00:52:34.990 --> 00:52:35.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:39.470 --> 00:52:39.480 align:start position:0%
27 okay but but the underlying system is
 
00:52:41.670 --> 00:52:41.680 align:start position:0%
has we've funded the underlying system
 
00:52:43.549 --> 00:52:43.559 align:start position:0%
this this this the money that you're
 
00:52:46.430 --> 00:52:46.440 align:start position:0%
referring to I believe is uh to modify
 
00:52:49.109 --> 00:52:49.119 align:start position:0%
or update the system the the numbers I
 
00:52:51.109 --> 00:52:51.119 align:start position:0%
just referred to are regarding the
 
00:52:53.270 --> 00:52:53.280 align:start position:0%
current state of the amended bill as
 
00:52:55.470 --> 00:52:55.480 align:start position:0%
opposed to the original $3 million plus
 
00:52:58.309 --> 00:52:58.319 align:start position:0%
PR price tag
 
00:53:00.670 --> 00:53:00.680 align:start position:0%
and I don't believe well so I do believe
 
00:53:03.270 --> 00:53:03.280 align:start position:0%
it's related to the current bill but I
 
00:53:07.470 --> 00:53:07.480 align:start position:0%
think we did fund the underlying system
 
00:53:09.829 --> 00:53:09.839 align:start position:0%
separately and I if I'm wrong I want to
 
00:53:11.670 --> 00:53:11.680 align:start position:0%
be told I'm wrong right ra if I could
 
00:53:13.829 --> 00:53:13.839 align:start position:0%
clarify so the the updated fiscal note
 
00:53:16.030 --> 00:53:16.040 align:start position:0%
reflects the six the onetime $60 to
 
00:53:18.670 --> 00:53:18.680 align:start position:0%
80,000 upgrade if this legislation would
 
00:53:22.230 --> 00:53:22.240 align:start position:0%
pass plus a position to run the trans
 
00:53:23.870 --> 00:53:23.880 align:start position:0%
transaction reports that's the current
 
00:53:27.069 --> 00:53:27.079 align:start position:0%
fiscal what the fiscal note represents O
 
00:53:28.950 --> 00:53:28.960 align:start position:0%
Okay so I think you just agreed with me
 
00:53:30.710 --> 00:53:30.720 align:start position:0%
we've already funded the underlying
 
00:53:32.670 --> 00:53:32.680 align:start position:0%
system that this system has been
 
00:53:34.750 --> 00:53:34.760 align:start position:0%
previously funded but that would be for
 
00:53:37.390 --> 00:53:37.400 align:start position:0%
routine operations and maintenance this
 
00:53:39.510 --> 00:53:39.520 align:start position:0%
would be above and beyond that as an
 
00:53:41.470 --> 00:53:41.480 align:start position:0%
enhan I just wanted everyone to have a
 
00:53:43.030 --> 00:53:43.040 align:start position:0%
common understanding that the base
 
00:53:45.710 --> 00:53:45.720 align:start position:0%
system is paid for and and this is
 
00:53:47.870 --> 00:53:47.880 align:start position:0%
additional money to support the
 
00:53:50.270 --> 00:53:50.280 align:start position:0%
incremental changes needed by this
 
00:53:52.030 --> 00:53:52.040 align:start position:0%
legislation right correct we're all
 
00:53:54.230 --> 00:53:54.240 align:start position:0%
saying the same thing representative tki
 
00:53:57.230 --> 00:53:57.240 align:start position:0%
thank you I just want to dig a Little
 
00:53:59.750 --> 00:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
Deeper to make sure I understand what I
 
00:54:03.390 --> 00:54:03.400 align:start position:0%
heard was the lay on Amendment though
 
00:54:05.750 --> 00:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
because it just sort of sets an
 
00:54:09.230 --> 00:54:09.240 align:start position:0%
expectation removes the actual fiscal
 
00:54:12.990 --> 00:54:13.000 align:start position:0%
note removes any additional cost is that
 
00:54:15.270 --> 00:54:15.280 align:start position:0%
correct my understanding is that that
 
00:54:16.990 --> 00:54:17.000 align:start position:0%
would allow the flexibility because it's
 
00:54:19.870 --> 00:54:19.880 align:start position:0%
not requiring them to do that right now
 
00:54:22.230 --> 00:54:22.240 align:start position:0%
so um if there's if there's not funding
 
00:54:23.670 --> 00:54:23.680 align:start position:0%
that it could be done in the future
 
00:54:25.950 --> 00:54:25.960 align:start position:0%
before there's anou okay so my question
 
00:54:27.470 --> 00:54:27.480 align:start position:0%
then goes back
 
00:54:31.030 --> 00:54:31.040 align:start position:0%
to if they decide to pursue this let's
 
00:54:34.150 --> 00:54:34.160 align:start position:0%
say Vermont you want to develop that
 
00:54:37.349 --> 00:54:37.359 align:start position:0%
connection with and you need to do this
 
00:54:39.430 --> 00:54:39.440 align:start position:0%
my question sort of is where's that
 
00:54:42.349 --> 00:54:42.359 align:start position:0%
money going to come from at that
 
00:54:44.589 --> 00:54:44.599 align:start position:0%
point I don't know who I'm directing
 
00:54:47.750 --> 00:54:47.760 align:start position:0%
that at I I I would think if if it's
 
00:54:49.630 --> 00:54:49.640 align:start position:0%
authorized in law and they want to do it
 
00:54:51.270 --> 00:54:51.280 align:start position:0%
and they run it through the governor's
 
00:54:53.309 --> 00:54:53.319 align:start position:0%
budget that it would be a budget item in
 
00:54:55.109 --> 00:54:55.119 align:start position:0%
the next budget so it would be the next
 
00:54:57.190 --> 00:54:57.200 align:start position:0%
budget year it's not something that
 
00:55:00.390 --> 00:55:00.400 align:start position:0%
could be happen in the next 5 months if
 
00:55:03.510 --> 00:55:03.520 align:start position:0%
that arises unless they have uh funds
 
00:55:06.670 --> 00:55:06.680 align:start position:0%
already within the broad budget to to do
 
00:55:08.430 --> 00:55:08.440 align:start position:0%
that do do you want to speak now
 
00:55:10.430 --> 00:55:10.440 align:start position:0%
representative wer or Mr White has
 
00:55:11.670 --> 00:55:11.680 align:start position:0%
something to say
 
00:55:14.030 --> 00:55:14.040 align:start position:0%
too they have the flexibility within
 
00:55:15.870 --> 00:55:15.880 align:start position:0%
their budget they could come to fiscal
 
00:55:18.470 --> 00:55:18.480 align:start position:0%
and transfer money but if if the money's
 
00:55:21.510 --> 00:55:21.520 align:start position:0%
already there within that computer line
 
00:55:24.710 --> 00:55:24.720 align:start position:0%
and it's the EIT line it could be if
 
00:55:26.750 --> 00:55:26.760 align:start position:0%
there's money there otherwise they could
 
00:55:28.589 --> 00:55:28.599 align:start position:0%
move it from somewhere else we always
 
00:55:32.510 --> 00:55:32.520 align:start position:0%
expect them to to lapse millions of
 
00:55:34.829 --> 00:55:34.839 align:start position:0%
dollars sometimes they do sometimes they
 
00:55:37.549 --> 00:55:37.559 align:start position:0%
don't so you know that could be an
 
00:55:39.069 --> 00:55:39.079 align:start position:0%
excuse they could come to fiscal if they
 
00:55:40.309 --> 00:55:40.319 align:start position:0%
wanted to move it within their own
 
00:55:42.069 --> 00:55:42.079 align:start position:0%
budget and it was more than what was
 
00:55:44.069 --> 00:55:44.079 align:start position:0%
there but there's ways they can do that
 
00:55:45.789 --> 00:55:45.799 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr White I don't
 
00:55:47.910 --> 00:55:47.920 align:start position:0%
know if you would Mr White did you have
 
00:55:51.670 --> 00:55:51.680 align:start position:0%
a comment no no more more uh following
 
00:55:55.230 --> 00:55:55.240 align:start position:0%
up on what uh chairman wer was saying um
 
00:55:57.670 --> 00:55:57.680 align:start position:0%
no we we do not not have any funds
 
00:55:59.789 --> 00:55:59.799 align:start position:0%
explicitly budgeted for this enhancement
 
00:56:01.390 --> 00:56:01.400 align:start position:0%
or the enhancement of the prior two
 
00:56:03.950 --> 00:56:03.960 align:start position:0%
bills um some years we laps more money
 
00:56:05.029 --> 00:56:05.039 align:start position:0%
than others this year we're not
 
00:56:08.309 --> 00:56:08.319 align:start position:0%
projecting to lapse a whole lot um but
 
00:56:10.349 --> 00:56:10.359 align:start position:0%
things can change between now and June
 
00:56:11.910 --> 00:56:11.920 align:start position:0%
um so we won't know but those funds will
 
00:56:13.390 --> 00:56:13.400 align:start position:0%
lapse they wouldn't necessarily be used
 
00:56:15.230 --> 00:56:15.240 align:start position:0%
for this public health generally
 
00:56:17.270 --> 00:56:17.280 align:start position:0%
speaking is significantly higher federal
 
00:56:19.589 --> 00:56:19.599 align:start position:0%
funds there's fewer General funds
 
00:56:20.829 --> 00:56:20.839 align:start position:0%
available and there's a lot less
 
00:56:23.190 --> 00:56:23.200 align:start position:0%
flexibility within their budget comp
 
00:56:24.630 --> 00:56:24.640 align:start position:0%
compared to other areas to the
 
00:56:26.910 --> 00:56:26.920 align:start position:0%
likelihood of being able to find public
 
00:56:28.670 --> 00:56:28.680 align:start position:0%
health dollars within the existing
 
00:56:32.270 --> 00:56:32.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:35.950 --> 00:56:35.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:39.309 --> 00:56:39.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:41.910 --> 00:56:41.920 align:start position:0%
chair yeah so if I if I understand the
 
00:56:43.589 --> 00:56:43.599 align:start position:0%
department is that even with the
 
00:56:46.630 --> 00:56:46.640 align:start position:0%
implementation of this amendment um your
 
00:56:49.750 --> 00:56:49.760 align:start position:0%
preference would be to or or that your
 
00:56:51.950 --> 00:56:51.960 align:start position:0%
practice would be to go ahead and start
 
00:56:54.309 --> 00:56:54.319 align:start position:0%
getting the systems ready to handle it
 
00:56:56.950 --> 00:56:56.960 align:start position:0%
and therefore uh the expense that are
 
00:56:59.510 --> 00:56:59.520 align:start position:0%
involved in in the fiscal note that we
 
00:57:04.390 --> 00:57:04.400 align:start position:0%
have is amended by the house uh uh 1619
 
00:57:08.230 --> 00:57:08.240 align:start position:0%
h which called for1 161 to
 
00:57:11.950 --> 00:57:11.960 align:start position:0%
$181,000 of Appropriations in this
 
00:57:17.349 --> 00:57:17.359 align:start position:0%
bium um um would would would be needed
 
00:57:20.510 --> 00:57:20.520 align:start position:0%
you know to implement the bill as as as
 
00:57:22.069 --> 00:57:22.079 align:start position:0%
amended thank you for the question uh
 
00:57:23.589 --> 00:57:23.599 align:start position:0%
currently we don't share information
 
00:57:25.430 --> 00:57:25.440 align:start position:0%
with other states but in preparation to
 
00:57:27.230 --> 00:57:27.240 align:start position:0%
do so if we did do so we would need
 
00:57:29.069 --> 00:57:29.079 align:start position:0%
those funds in order to bring the system
 
00:57:32.710 --> 00:57:32.720 align:start position:0%
up up to um to do that it's 100% of this
 
00:57:34.990 --> 00:57:35.000 align:start position:0%
out of the general fund or laap fund or
 
00:57:36.870 --> 00:57:36.880 align:start position:0%
some of it would some of it come from
 
00:57:36.880 --> 00:57:38.430 align:start position:0%
some of it would some of it come from
federal

00:57:38.430 --> 00:57:38.440 align:start position:0%
federal
 
00:57:41.789 --> 00:57:41.799 align:start position:0%
government um there would probably be a
 
00:57:44.589 --> 00:57:44.599 align:start position:0%
match of some sort but today we do not
 
00:57:45.789 --> 00:57:45.799 align:start position:0%
have these funds
 
00:57:45.799 --> 00:57:48.710 align:start position:0%
have these funds
budgeted

00:57:48.710 --> 00:57:48.720 align:start position:0%
budgeted
 
00:57:52.910 --> 00:57:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:56.190 --> 00:57:56.200 align:start position:0%
you question for Mr White is this a 50
 
00:57:58.950 --> 00:57:58.960 align:start position:0%
50 Style Match do you know it would
 
00:58:01.190 --> 00:58:01.200 align:start position:0%
depend on the specific funding sources I
 
00:58:03.630 --> 00:58:03.640 align:start position:0%
think it's higher is it I don't know up
 
00:58:12.470 --> 00:58:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:15.829 --> 00:58:15.839 align:start position:0%
two represent W this is I think a
 
00:58:18.270 --> 00:58:18.280 align:start position:0%
question for Mr
 
00:58:22.109 --> 00:58:22.119 align:start position:0%
White so the fiscal Note require is
 
00:58:25.549 --> 00:58:25.559 align:start position:0%
talking about the development of a um a
 
00:58:28.670 --> 00:58:28.680 align:start position:0%
specialist for position so would you
 
00:58:28.680 --> 00:58:30.230 align:start position:0%
specialist for position so would you
need

00:58:30.230 --> 00:58:30.240 align:start position:0%
need
 
00:58:35.190 --> 00:58:35.200 align:start position:0%
Authority within the bill to hire this
 
00:58:38.430 --> 00:58:38.440 align:start position:0%
position there so if I may not note note
 
00:58:40.990 --> 00:58:41.000 align:start position:0%
that the fiscal note got updated and the
 
00:58:44.230 --> 00:58:44.240 align:start position:0%
fiscal are you referring to fiscal note
 
00:58:48.589 --> 00:58:48.599 align:start position:0%
2655 yeah okay all right go ahead sure
 
00:58:50.069 --> 00:58:50.079 align:start position:0%
um there's a couple of ways that
 
00:58:52.150 --> 00:58:52.160 align:start position:0%
positions can be created if we receive a
 
00:58:53.630 --> 00:58:53.640 align:start position:0%
new Federal grant we can come through
 
00:58:55.510 --> 00:58:55.520 align:start position:0%
fiscal and have fiscal establish a
 
00:58:57.750 --> 00:58:57.760 align:start position:0%
position there's also a way to establish
 
00:59:00.150 --> 00:59:00.160 align:start position:0%
temporary full-time position via Das
 
00:59:01.670 --> 00:59:01.680 align:start position:0%
however again there's been no
 
00:59:03.510 --> 00:59:03.520 align:start position:0%
appropriation given here so we wouldn't
 
00:59:06.710 --> 00:59:06.720 align:start position:0%
anticipate on doing that anytime soon um
 
00:59:08.750 --> 00:59:08.760 align:start position:0%
as you know we reported to the fiscal
 
00:59:11.150 --> 00:59:11.160 align:start position:0%
committee that our estimated lapse
 
00:59:13.870 --> 00:59:13.880 align:start position:0%
projections are going to be currently
 
00:59:15.230 --> 00:59:15.240 align:start position:0%
less than last year and we still have
 
00:59:17.270 --> 00:59:17.280 align:start position:0%
our $23 million general fund back the
 
00:59:24.349 --> 00:59:24.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:26.309 --> 00:59:26.319 align:start position:0%
hit I think this is a question question
 
00:59:27.990 --> 00:59:28.000 align:start position:0%
for our chairman of
 
00:59:30.109 --> 00:59:30.119 align:start position:0%
Finance would it be appropriate to have
 
00:59:32.750 --> 00:59:32.760 align:start position:0%
an amendment to the amendment that
 
00:59:35.430 --> 00:59:35.440 align:start position:0%
authorizes the funding in the position
 
00:59:38.589 --> 00:59:38.599 align:start position:0%
to do this I don't know how this is done
 
00:59:40.390 --> 00:59:40.400 align:start position:0%
well I understand you want it this to go
 
00:59:42.150 --> 00:59:42.160 align:start position:0%
into effect immediately so yes that
 
00:59:43.910 --> 00:59:43.920 align:start position:0%
would be the only way it could happen if
 
00:59:45.549 --> 00:59:45.559 align:start position:0%
if we started to put an appropriation
 
00:59:48.470 --> 00:59:48.480 align:start position:0%
that was available it's not otherwise
 
00:59:50.390 --> 00:59:50.400 align:start position:0%
appropriate so there's been nothing to
 
00:59:52.589 --> 00:59:52.599 align:start position:0%
stop a member of division three from
 
00:59:55.510 --> 00:59:55.520 align:start position:0%
submitting an amendment to that effect
 
00:59:57.589 --> 00:59:57.599 align:start position:0%
uh yeah so so if we took the amendment I
 
00:59:59.069 --> 00:59:59.079 align:start position:0%
handed mine off but if we took the
 
01:00:03.309 --> 01:00:03.319 align:start position:0%
amendment uh 1073 H and added to it
 
01:00:05.309 --> 01:00:05.319 align:start position:0%
right because of the inment date that
 
01:00:09.150 --> 01:00:09.160 align:start position:0%
the funding mechanism is there and that
 
01:00:10.950 --> 01:00:10.960 align:start position:0%
the necessary positions are taken care
 
01:00:13.829 --> 01:00:13.839 align:start position:0%
of could that be drafted in preparation
 
01:00:18.109 --> 01:00:18.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:20.589 --> 01:00:20.599 align:start position:0%
meeting are are you owning the amendment
 
01:00:22.549 --> 01:00:22.559 align:start position:0%
or is this still absolutely okay so this
 
01:00:24.309 --> 01:00:24.319 align:start position:0%
is this is the whole amendment that
 
01:00:26.549 --> 01:00:26.559 align:start position:0%
you're proposing and is then the
 
01:00:28.870 --> 01:00:28.880 align:start position:0%
question is can it be ready by or vote
 
01:00:30.630 --> 01:00:30.640 align:start position:0%
on Friday because we have one more day
 
01:00:34.950 --> 01:00:34.960 align:start position:0%
to do this yeah sure I I I think it can
 
01:00:39.109 --> 01:00:39.119 align:start position:0%
and yeah okay so so work with Mickey to
 
01:00:41.309 --> 01:00:41.319 align:start position:0%
figure out how you want that Amendment
 
01:00:44.990 --> 01:00:45.000 align:start position:0%
and uh we can uh defer a vote on this
 
01:00:46.829 --> 01:00:46.839 align:start position:0%
until we see your Amendment and we'll
 
01:00:50.750 --> 01:00:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:50.760 --> 01:00:52.750 align:start position:0%
 
Friday

01:00:52.750 --> 01:00:52.760 align:start position:0%
Friday
 
01:00:55.510 --> 01:00:55.520 align:start position:0%
question would it be possible to have an
 
01:01:00.549 --> 01:01:00.559 align:start position:0%
update fiscal with everything on it by
 
01:01:04.309 --> 01:01:04.319 align:start position:0%
Friday formally the answer is no because
 
01:01:07.710 --> 01:01:07.720 align:start position:0%
until the house votes on it the LBA
 
01:01:10.910 --> 01:01:10.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't generate new fiscal notes what
 
01:01:13.549 --> 01:01:13.559 align:start position:0%
what what Mr Ripple has done and maybe
 
01:01:16.630 --> 01:01:16.640 align:start position:0%
Mickey has done this as well is
 
01:01:18.349 --> 01:01:18.359 align:start position:0%
sometimes he's done like a back of the
 
01:01:20.950 --> 01:01:20.960 align:start position:0%
envelope swag so that we have some idea
 
01:01:22.589 --> 01:01:22.599 align:start position:0%
what kind of money we're talking about
 
01:01:24.870 --> 01:01:24.880 align:start position:0%
but the the obligation to create a full
 
01:01:27.270 --> 01:01:27.280 align:start position:0%
fisc a formal fiscal note doesn't occur
 
01:01:29.390 --> 01:01:29.400 align:start position:0%
until after the bill is changed on the
 
01:01:29.400 --> 01:01:32.710 align:start position:0%
until after the bill is changed on the
floor

01:01:32.710 --> 01:01:32.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:35.549 --> 01:01:35.559 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for the clarification
 
01:01:38.270 --> 01:01:38.280 align:start position:0%
representative string yeah I would say
 
01:01:42.390 --> 01:01:42.400 align:start position:0%
that um that the fiscal note that 2655
 
01:01:44.750 --> 01:01:44.760 align:start position:0%
is going to be very similar to what the
 
01:01:49.230 --> 01:01:49.240 align:start position:0%
fiscal n note would be coming out of the
 
01:01:51.710 --> 01:01:51.720 align:start position:0%
uh this amended Bill and representative
 
01:01:54.470 --> 01:01:54.480 align:start position:0%
HS because basically the Department's
 
01:01:56.390 --> 01:01:56.400 align:start position:0%
telling us if you want us to prare for
 
01:01:59.910 --> 01:01:59.920 align:start position:0%
this we have to spend the money and the
 
01:02:02.670 --> 01:02:02.680 align:start position:0%
amendment that we just looked at today
 
01:02:05.950 --> 01:02:05.960 align:start position:0%
basically basically said please you know
 
01:02:07.549 --> 01:02:07.559 align:start position:0%
you're not required to spend any money
 
01:02:09.109 --> 01:02:09.119 align:start position:0%
till you want to go but the department
 
01:02:10.870 --> 01:02:10.880 align:start position:0%
would like to move ahead and the
 
01:02:12.269 --> 01:02:12.279 align:start position:0%
amendment that we're going to see is
 
01:02:14.589 --> 01:02:14.599 align:start position:0%
going to say let's appropriate the money
 
01:02:16.710 --> 01:02:16.720 align:start position:0%
so they can make the preparations and I
 
01:02:18.910 --> 01:02:18.920 align:start position:0%
think it'll be these
 
01:02:21.710 --> 01:02:21.720 align:start position:0%
amounts um thank you and I think you're
 
01:02:23.829 --> 01:02:23.839 align:start position:0%
talking about the amended version of
 
01:02:27.670 --> 01:02:27.680 align:start position:0%
2655 that was amended on March 6 correct
 
01:02:31.589 --> 01:02:31.599 align:start position:0%
that's correct 0619 H so and the
 
01:02:35.069 --> 01:02:35.079 align:start position:0%
expenditures are more in the 161 to 168
 
01:02:38.309 --> 01:02:38.319 align:start position:0%
in this bium and another couple hundred,
 
01:02:43.230 --> 01:02:43.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:46.510 --> 01:02:46.520 align:start position:0%
you okay for for for
 
01:02:49.630 --> 01:02:49.640 align:start position:0%
cleanliness uh it would be nice if the
 
01:02:51.029 --> 01:02:51.039 align:start position:0%
if uh
 
01:02:54.269 --> 01:02:54.279 align:start position:0%
1073 which needs to be updated anyways
 
01:02:55.910 --> 01:02:55.920 align:start position:0%
because it doesn't have a committee
 
01:02:59.710 --> 01:02:59.720 align:start position:0%
member's name on it if if you took it
 
01:03:01.870 --> 01:03:01.880 align:start position:0%
along with your appropriation language
 
01:03:03.789 --> 01:03:03.799 align:start position:0%
and made one clean amendment that we
 
01:03:07.349 --> 01:03:07.359 align:start position:0%
could consider instead of the two is
 
01:03:09.109 --> 01:03:09.119 align:start position:0%
there isn't there is there anyone that
 
01:03:14.430 --> 01:03:14.440 align:start position:0%
objects to the the the concept of
 
01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:15.950 align:start position:0%
objects to the the the concept of
1073

01:03:15.950 --> 01:03:15.960 align:start position:0%
1073
 
01:03:19.630 --> 01:03:19.640 align:start position:0%
no you're not sure yet I'm still working
 
01:03:23.950 --> 01:03:23.960 align:start position:0%
on it okay so so if so represented hle
 
01:03:25.390 --> 01:03:25.400 align:start position:0%
would you would you make sure that
 
01:03:26.910 --> 01:03:26.920 align:start position:0%
Amendment gets put
 
01:03:30.390 --> 01:03:30.400 align:start position:0%
together all right um so we're going to
 
01:03:34.390 --> 01:03:34.400 align:start position:0%
go ahead and um postpone a decision on
 
01:03:38.589 --> 01:03:38.599 align:start position:0%
1669 until uh Friday uh where we meet
 
01:03:41.309 --> 01:03:41.319 align:start position:0%
again uh that's already in the calendar
 
01:03:44.190 --> 01:03:44.200 align:start position:0%
the house calendar so we're good there
 
01:03:46.789 --> 01:03:46.799 align:start position:0%
um so with that I'll I'll close
 
01:03:48.269 --> 01:03:48.279 align:start position:0%
discussion on
 
01:03:52.710 --> 01:03:52.720 align:start position:0%
1669 and open discussion on
 
01:03:55.230 --> 01:03:55.240 align:start position:0%
1363 this is relative to allowing
 
01:03:57.349 --> 01:03:57.359 align:start position:0%
members the general court to participate
 
01:04:00.990 --> 01:04:01.000 align:start position:0%

you
 
01:04:33.390 --> 01:04:33.400 align:start position:0%
um it um came to my when you're having a
 
01:04:36.390 --> 01:04:36.400 align:start position:0%
crisis um it's hard to find all the
 
01:04:40.150 --> 01:04:40.160 align:start position:0%
resources that you need in that moment
 
01:04:43.990 --> 01:04:44.000 align:start position:0%
and um I became aware of um
 
01:04:47.789 --> 01:04:47.799 align:start position:0%
EPA uh assistance programs um at another
 
01:04:52.269 --> 01:04:52.279 align:start position:0%
job of mine um and um let's see I'm
 
01:04:55.269 --> 01:04:55.279 align:start position:0%
going to tell a quick story last Tuesday
 
01:04:57.510 --> 01:04:57.520 align:start position:0%
I stepped out into my yard and noticed
 
01:05:00.309 --> 01:05:00.319 align:start position:0%
half my roof had blown off a back
 
01:05:03.029 --> 01:05:03.039 align:start position:0%
kitchen part and it's a mess and I'm
 
01:05:04.549 --> 01:05:04.559 align:start position:0%
like I don't know what I'm going to do
 
01:05:06.829 --> 01:05:06.839 align:start position:0%
about this I called my new insurance
 
01:05:09.029 --> 01:05:09.039 align:start position:0%
company and they said oh we'll send the
 
01:05:11.390 --> 01:05:11.400 align:start position:0%
adjuster right out and I said do you
 
01:05:13.670 --> 01:05:13.680 align:start position:0%
have a like an emergency repair crew
 
01:05:15.589 --> 01:05:15.599 align:start position:0%
that could put a tarp over we do we'll
 
01:05:19.549 --> 01:05:19.559 align:start position:0%
send Tony out um and so with one phone
 
01:05:21.950 --> 01:05:21.960 align:start position:0%
call and and they had a list of
 
01:05:23.829 --> 01:05:23.839 align:start position:0%
contractors because I don't have a list
 
01:05:25.710 --> 01:05:25.720 align:start position:0%
of contractors and we don't have phone
 
01:05:28.910 --> 01:05:28.920 align:start position:0%
books anymore you know that was easy so
 
01:05:31.390 --> 01:05:31.400 align:start position:0%
I realized with this one phone call
 
01:05:33.789 --> 01:05:33.799 align:start position:0%
everything got taken care of on that day
 
01:05:35.750 --> 01:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
I was home that day Tony showed up the
 
01:05:38.390 --> 01:05:38.400 align:start position:0%
adjuster showed up covered this is kind
 
01:05:40.829 --> 01:05:40.839 align:start position:0%
of what the employee assistance program
 
01:05:44.510 --> 01:05:44.520 align:start position:0%
can do for our members um your your
 
01:05:47.309 --> 01:05:47.319 align:start position:0%
child has a drug addiction and and you
 
01:05:50.309 --> 01:05:50.319 align:start position:0%
find out and and you need some referrals
 
01:05:54.630 --> 01:05:54.640 align:start position:0%
or some references or gambling problems
 
01:05:56.870 --> 01:05:56.880 align:start position:0%
or financial problems you know you get
 
01:05:58.950 --> 01:05:58.960 align:start position:0%
the paper in the mail that says your
 
01:06:01.269 --> 01:06:01.279 align:start position:0%
husband didn't pay the taxes and like oh
 
01:06:04.630 --> 01:06:04.640 align:start position:0%
my God anyway so it's like I said when
 
01:06:06.390 --> 01:06:06.400 align:start position:0%
you're in the middle of a crisis it is
 
01:06:08.390 --> 01:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
not the best time to try and find all
 
01:06:10.870 --> 01:06:10.880 align:start position:0%
these resources and that's what employee
 
01:06:14.190 --> 01:06:14.200 align:start position:0%
assistance program can do and they cover
 
01:06:17.910 --> 01:06:17.920 align:start position:0%
um lots of subjects and Mr Lawless is
 
01:06:20.510 --> 01:06:20.520 align:start position:0%
here as is attorney Williams that could
 
01:06:23.029 --> 01:06:23.039 align:start position:0%
speak if you'd like to hear because they
 
01:06:27.190 --> 01:06:27.200 align:start position:0%
know um this is very inexpensive as you
 
01:06:28.950 --> 01:06:28.960 align:start position:0%
know it's less than a
 
01:06:33.029 --> 01:06:33.039 align:start position:0%
$118,000 ask per year
 
01:06:36.990 --> 01:06:37.000 align:start position:0%
um and um it's a small thing to offer
 
01:06:41.150 --> 01:06:41.160 align:start position:0%
our representatives and Senators um we
 
01:06:44.589 --> 01:06:44.599 align:start position:0%
have stressful jobs and we Face crisises
 
01:06:46.750 --> 01:06:46.760 align:start position:0%
sometimes I've known of fellow
 
01:06:49.470 --> 01:06:49.480 align:start position:0%
legislators that have had death threats
 
01:06:51.710 --> 01:06:51.720 align:start position:0%
uh certainly bereavements and you know
 
01:06:55.710 --> 01:06:55.720 align:start position:0%
things like that so um the previous
 
01:06:58.750 --> 01:06:58.760 align:start position:0%
hearing brought up concerns about
 
01:07:01.069 --> 01:07:01.079 align:start position:0%
defining us as employees because it is
 
01:07:03.069 --> 01:07:03.079 align:start position:0%
in the title and we can't really change
 
01:07:04.990 --> 01:07:05.000 align:start position:0%
that but I believe there was an
 
01:07:08.710 --> 01:07:08.720 align:start position:0%
amendment that um clarified this was
 
01:07:11.309 --> 01:07:11.319 align:start position:0%
only for the
 
01:07:14.109 --> 01:07:14.119 align:start position:0%
representatives uh or senators and or
 
01:07:16.349 --> 01:07:16.359 align:start position:0%
close family members during their term
 
01:07:21.430 --> 01:07:21.440 align:start position:0%
of office um you know because you know I
 
01:07:23.510 --> 01:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
understand finance committee probably
 
01:07:27.390 --> 01:07:27.400 align:start position:0%
likes things like that tidy um so you
 
01:07:30.510 --> 01:07:30.520 align:start position:0%
refer to another amendment uh you're not
 
01:07:32.829 --> 01:07:32.839 align:start position:0%
you're it's what you just
 
01:07:35.750 --> 01:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
described is not in the base bill of
 
01:07:39.349 --> 01:07:39.359 align:start position:0%
1363 though is it where where it's
 
01:07:42.710 --> 01:07:42.720 align:start position:0%
limited during term of office yeah I did
 
01:07:44.710 --> 01:07:44.720 align:start position:0%
have that in an amendment and I'm sorry
 
01:07:47.870 --> 01:07:47.880 align:start position:0%
I don't have that handy okay but there
 
01:07:50.829 --> 01:07:50.839 align:start position:0%
is an amendment somewhere I believe it
 
01:07:53.269 --> 01:07:53.279 align:start position:0%
it didn't get voted on in the house yet
 
01:07:57.670 --> 01:07:57.680 align:start position:0%
right no no sorry I think it was alluded
 
01:07:59.950 --> 01:07:59.960 align:start position:0%
to that the policy committee discussed
 
01:08:03.230 --> 01:08:03.240 align:start position:0%
it as a possibility yes I'm seeing a
 
01:08:05.950 --> 01:08:05.960 align:start position:0%
head noting but it did not actually get
 
01:08:08.029 --> 01:08:08.039 align:start position:0%
attached to the bill before it was
 
01:08:11.069 --> 01:08:11.079 align:start position:0%
voting on so I think the option that the
 
01:08:13.510 --> 01:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
representative suggesting is that we
 
01:08:16.630 --> 01:08:16.640 align:start position:0%
draft that amendment to clarify
 
01:08:18.630 --> 01:08:18.640 align:start position:0%
specifically who it covers and we would
 
01:08:20.669 --> 01:08:20.679 align:start position:0%
need to bring it forward and term of
 
01:08:23.630 --> 01:08:23.640 align:start position:0%
coverage okay okay because the only
 
01:08:25.910 --> 01:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
amendment I'm aware of is the Edward's
 
01:08:28.309 --> 01:08:28.319 align:start position:0%
amendment to postpone the effective date
 
01:08:30.749 --> 01:08:30.759 align:start position:0%
on this for 10 years so it doesn't look
 
01:08:32.550 --> 01:08:32.560 align:start position:0%
to the citizens of New Hampshire that
 
01:08:35.390 --> 01:08:35.400 align:start position:0%
we're voting ourselves enhanced benefits
 
01:08:38.630 --> 01:08:38.640 align:start position:0%
right um I would like to bring the other
 
01:08:40.749 --> 01:08:40.759 align:start position:0%
Amendment and maybe not bring the
 
01:08:43.990 --> 01:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
Edwards Amendment but that's yours to do
 
01:08:46.669 --> 01:08:46.679 align:start position:0%
um we have no guarantee any of us will
 
01:08:50.229 --> 01:08:50.239 align:start position:0%
be reelected you know that's the point
 
01:08:52.110 --> 01:08:52.120 align:start position:0%
well the the point of the 10-year
 
01:08:54.470 --> 01:08:54.480 align:start position:0%
amendment is to make sure that it
 
01:08:56.510 --> 01:08:56.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't look like any of us are behaving
 
01:08:59.030 --> 01:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
in a self-serving manner I know but I
 
01:09:00.950 --> 01:09:00.960 align:start position:0%
think 10 years is
 
01:09:03.990 --> 01:09:04.000 align:start position:0%
Extreme um what would you be comfortable
 
01:09:08.669 --> 01:09:08.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:11.749 --> 01:09:11.759 align:start position:0%
2025 I I think I've heard similar but I
 
01:09:14.349 --> 01:09:14.359 align:start position:0%
don't have an amendment that says that
 
01:09:17.070 --> 01:09:17.080 align:start position:0%
so um go representative tki thank you I
 
01:09:18.309 --> 01:09:18.319 align:start position:0%
would be more than happy to work with
 
01:09:19.590 --> 01:09:19.600 align:start position:0%
the representative to draft the
 
01:09:21.229 --> 01:09:21.239 align:start position:0%
amendment with an effective date of the
 
01:09:23.349 --> 01:09:23.359 align:start position:0%
next bium that none of us know if we'll
 
01:09:26.189 --> 01:09:26.199 align:start position:0%
be here or not I I want to make sure
 
01:09:28.110 --> 01:09:28.120 align:start position:0%
that we don't know that I mean that's to
 
01:09:30.070 --> 01:09:30.080 align:start position:0%
me that's like the critical thing that
 
01:09:33.390 --> 01:09:33.400 align:start position:0%
we're not voting to uh self- andrise our
 
01:09:35.829 --> 01:09:35.839 align:start position:0%
own benefit package it should for be a
 
01:09:38.789 --> 01:09:38.799 align:start position:0%
future one and I I'd be more comfortable
 
01:09:41.590 --> 01:09:41.600 align:start position:0%
if it was a term or two away you know I
 
01:09:44.070 --> 01:09:44.080 align:start position:0%
I I I want some distance between us and
 
01:09:48.149 --> 01:09:48.159 align:start position:0%
the and the enhanced package but are you
 
01:09:50.110 --> 01:09:50.120 align:start position:0%
are on in your Amendment are you also
 
01:09:53.430 --> 01:09:53.440 align:start position:0%
going to address the policy discussion
 
01:09:55.350 --> 01:09:55.360 align:start position:0%
in your Amendment the one that
 
01:09:57.070 --> 01:09:57.080 align:start position:0%
representative letter upam just
 
01:09:59.070 --> 01:09:59.080 align:start position:0%
described the notes I took down as an
 
01:10:01.750 --> 01:10:01.760 align:start position:0%
amendment to clarify that it's only for
 
01:10:03.350 --> 01:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
elected representatives during their
 
01:10:06.709 --> 01:10:06.719 align:start position:0%
term of office so the end of their term
 
01:10:08.310 --> 01:10:08.320 align:start position:0%
of office would be the last day they
 
01:10:10.270 --> 01:10:10.280 align:start position:0%
could utilize said services and they
 
01:10:12.350 --> 01:10:12.360 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to begin to participate
 
01:10:14.510 --> 01:10:14.520 align:start position:0%
until the day they were sworn in is what
 
01:10:16.669 --> 01:10:16.679 align:start position:0%
I would assume be the definition of that
 
01:10:19.270 --> 01:10:19.280 align:start position:0%
would would you put family members in or
 
01:10:22.550 --> 01:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
out um I don't Rec I'm sorry can I I
 
01:10:23.990 --> 01:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
don't recall if the family members were
 
01:10:26.070 --> 01:10:26.080 align:start position:0%
included in the original bill I I
 
01:10:29.189 --> 01:10:29.199 align:start position:0%
believe they were or or that's how um
 
01:10:30.390 --> 01:10:30.400 align:start position:0%
that's how the program works is what
 
01:10:33.270 --> 01:10:33.280 align:start position:0%
you're saying yeah can we you want to
 
01:10:35.270 --> 01:10:35.280 align:start position:0%
confer with Mr law no you're no we've
 
01:10:36.750 --> 01:10:36.760 align:start position:0%
heard that I don't think representative
 
01:10:40.110 --> 01:10:40.120 align:start position:0%
tki was here that day but okay um
 
01:10:41.990 --> 01:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
representative wer I'm trying to
 
01:10:44.149 --> 01:10:44.159 align:start position:0%
remember the discussion on this was this
 
01:10:46.270 --> 01:10:46.280 align:start position:0%
the one that came from the committee as
 
01:10:48.510 --> 01:10:48.520 align:start position:0%
inexpedient do you have the dock at
 
01:10:51.830 --> 01:10:51.840 align:start position:0%
Handy I I do it uh it did come out with
 
01:10:54.630 --> 01:10:54.640 align:start position:0%
an itl recommendation uh but it passed
 
01:10:56.510 --> 01:10:56.520 align:start position:0%
on a roll call vote on the house floor
 
01:10:58.550 --> 01:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
184 to
 
01:11:01.070 --> 01:11:01.080 align:start position:0%
168 thank
 
01:11:04.430 --> 01:11:04.440 align:start position:0%
you which shows that the the body is in
 
01:11:06.070 --> 01:11:06.080 align:start position:0%
favor of it I mean there what we didn't
 
01:11:08.390 --> 01:11:08.400 align:start position:0%
even have a debate that day we had no
 
01:11:13.149 --> 01:11:13.159 align:start position:0%
piis and it passed so I agree with not
 
01:11:15.950 --> 01:11:15.960 align:start position:0%
passing laws that self- enrise ourselves
 
01:11:20.790 --> 01:11:20.800 align:start position:0%
you know as as lawmakers you know um but
 
01:11:22.790 --> 01:11:22.800 align:start position:0%
as I point out we don't know that we'll
 
01:11:26.270 --> 01:11:26.280 align:start position:0%
be reelected so for it to start for the
 
01:11:29.830 --> 01:11:29.840 align:start position:0%
next term whoever gets
 
01:11:33.750 --> 01:11:33.760 align:start position:0%
reelected well we'll think about that
 
01:11:36.470 --> 01:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
represent um I think to comply with the
 
01:11:38.990 --> 01:11:39.000 align:start position:0%
US Constitution under the 27th Amendment
 
01:11:42.270 --> 01:11:42.280 align:start position:0%
which was proposed in 1789 but didn't
 
01:11:46.070 --> 01:11:46.080 align:start position:0%
confirmed until 1992 almost 200 years to
 
01:11:49.669 --> 01:11:49.679 align:start position:0%
the year um as the adoption cycle we
 
01:11:51.750 --> 01:11:51.760 align:start position:0%
would have to make sure that this is not
 
01:11:54.750 --> 01:11:54.760 align:start position:0%
enacted until after the next election
 
01:11:54.760 --> 01:11:55.910 align:start position:0%
enacted until after the next election
cycle

01:11:55.910 --> 01:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
cycle
 
01:11:58.470 --> 01:11:58.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:00.750 --> 01:12:00.760 align:start position:0%
Minimate representative tki and then
 
01:12:02.510 --> 01:12:02.520 align:start position:0%
representative walner I was simply going
 
01:12:04.030 --> 01:12:04.040 align:start position:0%
to suggest that maybe we put the
 
01:12:07.430 --> 01:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
effective date to be in the next budget
 
01:12:10.910 --> 01:12:10.920 align:start position:0%
cycle ah or
 
01:12:14.270 --> 01:12:14.280 align:start position:0%
two we hear you representative distance
 
01:12:16.669 --> 01:12:16.679 align:start position:0%
makes my heart grow fonder on this one
 
01:12:20.510 --> 01:12:20.520 align:start position:0%
but that's just me uh representative
 
01:12:23.950 --> 01:12:23.960 align:start position:0%
Waller okay representative wer did you
 
01:12:29.270 --> 01:12:29.280 align:start position:0%
have another comment I I I just I was
 
01:12:31.070 --> 01:12:31.080 align:start position:0%
not in favor of this when it came to the
 
01:12:33.430 --> 01:12:33.440 align:start position:0%
floor trying to remember what the and as
 
01:12:36.149 --> 01:12:36.159 align:start position:0%
I I recall there wasn't an itl from the
 
01:12:40.590 --> 01:12:40.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:43.149 --> 01:12:43.159 align:start position:0%
you so one reason that I think this
 
01:12:45.350 --> 01:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
could be is really important and could
 
01:12:47.430 --> 01:12:47.440 align:start position:0%
be beneficial it's not just beneficial
 
01:12:51.189 --> 01:12:51.199 align:start position:0%
yes to the um legislator but I think it
 
01:12:53.070 --> 01:12:53.080 align:start position:0%
could also be really beneficial to the
 
01:12:55.870 --> 01:12:55.880 align:start position:0%
operating of the house and
 
01:12:58.990 --> 01:12:59.000 align:start position:0%
senate for the leadership because when
 
01:13:03.229 --> 01:13:03.239 align:start position:0%
people do have things that are stressful
 
01:13:06.950 --> 01:13:06.960 align:start position:0%
to them often they come here with those
 
01:13:11.750 --> 01:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
issues and whether the advice they get
 
01:13:13.790 --> 01:13:13.800 align:start position:0%
from fellow legislators or from
 
01:13:17.750 --> 01:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
leadership is helpful or even
 
01:13:22.270 --> 01:13:22.280 align:start position:0%
correct um might end up being sort of
 
01:13:25.189 --> 01:13:25.199 align:start position:0%
detrimental to the the full to the full
 
01:13:27.110 --> 01:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
house and this way we would know they
 
01:13:31.149 --> 01:13:31.159 align:start position:0%
were getting good professional advice um
 
01:13:34.709 --> 01:13:34.719 align:start position:0%
about how to handle the situation or
 
01:13:36.229 --> 01:13:36.239 align:start position:0%
suggestions about things that might be
 
01:13:37.990 --> 01:13:38.000 align:start position:0%
available so to me it's almost feels
 
01:13:42.629 --> 01:13:42.639 align:start position:0%
like a tool for the leadership um to
 
01:13:45.430 --> 01:13:45.440 align:start position:0%
really be able to be sure people are
 
01:13:49.590 --> 01:13:49.600 align:start position:0%
getting the best advice that we can be
 
01:13:52.510 --> 01:13:52.520 align:start position:0%
given um thank you one of the things
 
01:13:54.229 --> 01:13:54.239 align:start position:0%
that I found most interesting in this
 
01:13:56.110 --> 01:13:56.120 align:start position:0%
role is when people come to us and they
 
01:13:58.070 --> 01:13:58.080 align:start position:0%
have challenges especially things where
 
01:14:00.229 --> 01:14:00.239 align:start position:0%
there are government programs that help
 
01:14:03.070 --> 01:14:03.080 align:start position:0%
learning that process both when I am
 
01:14:05.790 --> 01:14:05.800 align:start position:0%
helping a constituent track down how you
 
01:14:07.350 --> 01:14:07.360 align:start position:0%
address something at the labor labor
 
01:14:09.669 --> 01:14:09.679 align:start position:0%
department or how you address something
 
01:14:12.030 --> 01:14:12.040 align:start position:0%
around Medicaid going through the
 
01:14:14.110 --> 01:14:14.120 align:start position:0%
process that we have for everybody else
 
01:14:16.189 --> 01:14:16.199 align:start position:0%
in the state and doing that ourselves I
 
01:14:17.870 --> 01:14:17.880 align:start position:0%
think is a really good way that keeps us
 
01:14:20.709 --> 01:14:20.719 align:start position:0%
connected because we know better what
 
01:14:23.030 --> 01:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
the resources are and we share them with
 
01:14:24.750 --> 01:14:24.760 align:start position:0%
those who come to us up in the grocery
 
01:14:27.390 --> 01:14:27.400 align:start position:0%
store speaking to us in town or call us
 
01:14:29.669 --> 01:14:29.679 align:start position:0%
with their challenges and I think that
 
01:14:32.030 --> 01:14:32.040 align:start position:0%
by by looking to those same resources
 
01:14:34.149 --> 01:14:34.159 align:start position:0%
and calling them for questions calling
 
01:14:37.310 --> 01:14:37.320 align:start position:0%
211 calling these other resources makes
 
01:14:39.750 --> 01:14:39.760 align:start position:0%
it so that we understand better what the
 
01:14:41.709 --> 01:14:41.719 align:start position:0%
people of New Hampshire also need to do
 
01:14:43.070 --> 01:14:43.080 align:start position:0%
in order to solve a lot of these
 
01:14:45.070 --> 01:14:45.080 align:start position:0%
problems and I honestly think that
 
01:14:46.510 --> 01:14:46.520 align:start position:0%
separating ourselves from that would
 
01:14:48.270 --> 01:14:48.280 align:start position:0%
mean that we're not as effective at
 
01:14:50.229 --> 01:14:50.239 align:start position:0%
constituent Services because it's a
 
01:14:51.550 --> 01:14:51.560 align:start position:0%
little more important when I have a
 
01:14:53.149 --> 01:14:53.159 align:start position:0%
question and I know this is I'm not
 
01:14:54.510 --> 01:14:54.520 align:start position:0%
going through back channels to talk to
 
01:14:56.990 --> 01:14:57.000 align:start position:0%
the legisl ative person I'm I'm reaching
 
01:14:59.189 --> 01:14:59.199 align:start position:0%
out as just a regular New Hampshire
 
01:15:00.950 --> 01:15:00.960 align:start position:0%
citizen through the normal channels and
 
01:15:02.350 --> 01:15:02.360 align:start position:0%
the normal process and then we
 
01:15:04.030 --> 01:15:04.040 align:start position:0%
experience the same way that all of our
 
01:15:04.040 --> 01:15:05.830 align:start position:0%
experience the same way that all of our
neighbors

01:15:05.830 --> 01:15:05.840 align:start position:0%
neighbors
 
01:15:10.430 --> 01:15:10.440 align:start position:0%
do most employees most employers offer
 
01:15:13.350 --> 01:15:13.360 align:start position:0%
Employee Assistance programs which our
 
01:15:17.629 --> 01:15:17.639 align:start position:0%
state run in our state I I listened when
 
01:15:19.470 --> 01:15:19.480 align:start position:0%
I wasn't sure if you were in favor or
 
01:15:22.990 --> 01:15:23.000 align:start position:0%
not but the the great thing about
 
01:15:24.669 --> 01:15:24.679 align:start position:0%
employee assistance program is that they
 
01:15:24.679 --> 01:15:25.950 align:start position:0%
employee assistance program is that they
have

01:15:25.950 --> 01:15:25.960 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:15:30.350 --> 01:15:30.360 align:start position:0%
um rearrange relationships with
 
01:15:32.430 --> 01:15:32.440 align:start position:0%
different agencies and whatever and they
 
01:15:36.270 --> 01:15:36.280 align:start position:0%
know right where to go quickly
 
01:15:40.430 --> 01:15:40.440 align:start position:0%
not go ahead um I you said that most
 
01:15:42.229 --> 01:15:42.239 align:start position:0%
people do not everybody in the state
 
01:15:43.950 --> 01:15:43.960 align:start position:0%
does and many people who are starting up
 
01:15:45.590 --> 01:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
small businesses are doing other things
 
01:15:48.270 --> 01:15:48.280 align:start position:0%
that don't have those same resources as
 
01:15:50.669 --> 01:15:50.679 align:start position:0%
those of us who either ourselves or our
 
01:15:53.110 --> 01:15:53.120 align:start position:0%
spouses work at a large company they're
 
01:15:55.470 --> 01:15:55.480 align:start position:0%
the ones that most need to be able to
 
01:15:57.550 --> 01:15:57.560 align:start position:0%
reach out directly to the state and the
 
01:15:59.550 --> 01:15:59.560 align:start position:0%
more that we understand that process I
 
01:16:01.310 --> 01:16:01.320 align:start position:0%
think the more receptive we are to our
 
01:16:03.070 --> 01:16:03.080 align:start position:0%
neighbors so I I think that putting
 
01:16:04.790 --> 01:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
ourselves separately and doing this and
 
01:16:06.790 --> 01:16:06.800 align:start position:0%
doing an employee assistance plan we're
 
01:16:08.750 --> 01:16:08.760 align:start position:0%
not not employees is something that
 
01:16:10.950 --> 01:16:10.960 align:start position:0%
bothers me but I think more importantly
 
01:16:13.110 --> 01:16:13.120 align:start position:0%
it sort of disconnects us from those
 
01:16:14.990 --> 01:16:15.000 align:start position:0%
citizens who most need the direct
 
01:16:16.590 --> 01:16:16.600 align:start position:0%
assistance through the state and through
 
01:16:18.950 --> 01:16:18.960 align:start position:0%
those programs that we have so that's
 
01:16:20.950 --> 01:16:20.960 align:start position:0%
just I guess a fundamental issue but
 
01:16:22.669 --> 01:16:22.679 align:start position:0%
that's one I wanted to highlight because
 
01:16:24.350 --> 01:16:24.360 align:start position:0%
I think that sort of that shared process
 
01:16:27.830 --> 01:16:27.840 align:start position:0%
is important so so so to take advantage
 
01:16:29.669 --> 01:16:29.679 align:start position:0%
of the work session part of this let me
 
01:16:32.070 --> 01:16:32.080 align:start position:0%
ask you a question I I think I just
 
01:16:33.470 --> 01:16:33.480 align:start position:0%
heard you say you're in favor of the
 
01:16:36.430 --> 01:16:36.440 align:start position:0%
bill no I'm not in favor of the bill I'm
 
01:16:38.270 --> 01:16:38.280 align:start position:0%
in favor of doing things the same way as
 
01:16:40.110 --> 01:16:40.120 align:start position:0%
most of our constituents which those who
 
01:16:42.390 --> 01:16:42.400 align:start position:0%
don't have any AP need to reach out to
 
01:16:45.030 --> 01:16:45.040 align:start position:0%
the resources offered okay or no
 
01:16:46.870 --> 01:16:46.880 align:start position:0%
resources so I I think I understand your
 
01:16:48.390 --> 01:16:48.400 align:start position:0%
point that there there are small
 
01:16:50.149 --> 01:16:50.159 align:start position:0%
business owners and the like that don't
 
01:16:51.830 --> 01:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
have this benefit and making it
 
01:16:54.629 --> 01:16:54.639 align:start position:0%
available to us is what separ in your
 
01:16:56.830 --> 01:16:56.840 align:start position:0%
mind separates us from our
 
01:16:59.990 --> 01:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
constituents yes okay I I I was having
 
01:17:02.990 --> 01:17:03.000 align:start position:0%
trouble with that so thank you I mean I
 
01:17:06.550 --> 01:17:06.560 align:start position:0%
I I actually would entertain um a motion
 
01:17:10.910 --> 01:17:10.920 align:start position:0%
to itl but out of respect uh for your
 
01:17:14.350 --> 01:17:14.360 align:start position:0%
position representative tersi uh I I'll
 
01:17:17.550 --> 01:17:17.560 align:start position:0%
wait until Friday to fight this uh you
 
01:17:20.189 --> 01:17:20.199 align:start position:0%
can bring your Amendment then I I am
 
01:17:23.510 --> 01:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
absolutely opposed to improving or
 
01:17:25.790 --> 01:17:25.800 align:start position:0%
creating the appearance of of uh
 
01:17:28.270 --> 01:17:28.280 align:start position:0%
improving our own benefit package and
 
01:17:29.870 --> 01:17:29.880 align:start position:0%
and that and that's where I am at it
 
01:17:32.990 --> 01:17:33.000 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a hard no for me um and the
 
01:17:35.910 --> 01:17:35.920 align:start position:0%
only way I would be less hard no would
 
01:17:38.310 --> 01:17:38.320 align:start position:0%
be if this is far enough out in the
 
01:17:42.189 --> 01:17:42.199 align:start position:0%
future that there's no you know Wink in
 
01:17:44.430 --> 01:17:44.440 align:start position:0%
a nod that oh I think I'm going to get
 
01:17:47.189 --> 01:17:47.199 align:start position:0%
reelected next term anyway so I I I just
 
01:17:49.149 --> 01:17:49.159 align:start position:0%
assume put it out a couple of terms just
 
01:17:52.270 --> 01:17:52.280 align:start position:0%
so that there's a clear disconnect
 
01:17:55.149 --> 01:17:55.159 align:start position:0%
between our vote and our benefit that
 
01:17:57.910 --> 01:17:57.920 align:start position:0%
that that's me but if I go ahead yes if
 
01:18:01.110 --> 01:18:01.120 align:start position:0%
I may I don't think any one of us would
 
01:18:03.830 --> 01:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
want to think oo I'm going to pass this
 
01:18:06.110 --> 01:18:06.120 align:start position:0%
because I intend to have a crisis in 18
 
01:18:08.470 --> 01:18:08.480 align:start position:0%
months that's going to be life-altering
 
01:18:12.390 --> 01:18:12.400 align:start position:0%
and um put me in a desperate place um
 
01:18:13.709 --> 01:18:13.719 align:start position:0%
and I guess that's maybe a
 
01:18:15.149 --> 01:18:15.159 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding then of what the
 
01:18:17.110 --> 01:18:17.120 align:start position:0%
program is and and how it would be used
 
01:18:19.950 --> 01:18:19.960 align:start position:0%
but I appreciate if you would allow me
 
01:18:22.390 --> 01:18:22.400 align:start position:0%
um that time to draft the amendment
 
01:18:24.790 --> 01:18:24.800 align:start position:0%
right and I I appreciate your implied
 
01:18:26.990 --> 01:18:27.000 align:start position:0%
humor and and the way you phrase that uh
 
01:18:29.070 --> 01:18:29.080 align:start position:0%
but it's like any benefit there's not a
 
01:18:31.550 --> 01:18:31.560 align:start position:0%
single benefit anyone could bring I mean
 
01:18:35.629 --> 01:18:35.639 align:start position:0%
it's uh at you know on station
 
01:18:37.470 --> 01:18:37.480 align:start position:0%
babysitting for example a lot of
 
01:18:39.550 --> 01:18:39.560 align:start position:0%
employers offer that I would be opposed
 
01:18:42.110 --> 01:18:42.120 align:start position:0%
to that you know for example I I just
 
01:18:44.990 --> 01:18:45.000 align:start position:0%
don't think we should be um I think the
 
01:18:47.030 --> 01:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
Constitution tells us what our benefits
 
01:18:50.110 --> 01:18:50.120 align:start position:0%
package is it's a $100 a year and and
 
01:18:52.669 --> 01:18:52.679 align:start position:0%
and I you know that's that's just where
 
01:18:56.470 --> 01:18:56.480 align:start position:0%
I am but but um so so we can U we'll
 
01:18:58.790 --> 01:18:58.800 align:start position:0%
just slide this to Friday to talk
 
01:19:01.189 --> 01:19:01.199 align:start position:0%
further when your amendment is
 
01:19:03.629 --> 01:19:03.639 align:start position:0%
prepared Friday is the drop dead though
 
01:19:06.189 --> 01:19:06.199 align:start position:0%
we have to we have to decide Friday yes
 
01:19:08.350 --> 01:19:08.360 align:start position:0%
sir uh thank you and thank you for
 
01:19:09.990 --> 01:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
bringing forward your opinions I will
 
01:19:12.669 --> 01:19:12.679 align:start position:0%
say there's a lot of things that we do
 
01:19:15.990 --> 01:19:16.000 align:start position:0%
for representatives and Senators that
 
01:19:18.510 --> 01:19:18.520 align:start position:0%
fall short of being an employee benefit
 
01:19:21.750 --> 01:19:21.760 align:start position:0%
we have breastfeeding stations uh in the
 
01:19:24.750 --> 01:19:24.760 align:start position:0%
state house if so if you're a lactating
 
01:19:27.550 --> 01:19:27.560 align:start position:0%
mother you have a place to go uh we as
 
01:19:29.750 --> 01:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
the legislator paid for it we have
 
01:19:33.030 --> 01:19:33.040 align:start position:0%
nursing available uh nurse uh for
 
01:19:36.149 --> 01:19:36.159 align:start position:0%
emergency care we saw that even even be
 
01:19:39.390 --> 01:19:39.400 align:start position:0%
of of benefit that is way more expensive
 
01:19:42.070 --> 01:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
than what this would be I think this is
 
01:19:44.950 --> 01:19:44.960 align:start position:0%
really addressing the same kind of a uh
 
01:19:47.229 --> 01:19:47.239 align:start position:0%
kind of an issue not not the same as
 
01:19:49.390 --> 01:19:49.400 align:start position:0%
having a life insurance or a health
 
01:19:51.669 --> 01:19:51.679 align:start position:0%
insurance benefit which are more
 
01:19:54.990 --> 01:19:55.000 align:start position:0%
traditional uh employee benefits uh then
 
01:19:57.910 --> 01:19:57.920 align:start position:0%
something like this is so that uh uh so
 
01:20:01.870 --> 01:20:01.880 align:start position:0%
that we have uh a healthy um and
 
01:20:05.669 --> 01:20:05.679 align:start position:0%
reactive to to crisis uh capabilities
 
01:20:09.229 --> 01:20:09.239 align:start position:0%
here for for those uh that uh that we at
 
01:20:11.110 --> 01:20:11.120 align:start position:0%
the state have elected to representes
 
01:20:13.430 --> 01:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
whether it's us or the ones that follow
 
01:20:16.590 --> 01:20:16.600 align:start position:0%
us okay that that being said um I
 
01:20:19.470 --> 01:20:19.480 align:start position:0%
appreciate uh that you would consider uh
 
01:20:22.390 --> 01:20:22.400 align:start position:0%
voting uh voting for this if say the
 
01:20:26.110 --> 01:20:26.120 align:start position:0%
implementation date was uh uh two bium
 
01:20:28.629 --> 01:20:28.639 align:start position:0%
out instead of one so thank you for that
 
01:20:31.470 --> 01:20:31.480 align:start position:0%
I I'd be I'd be much more open to that
 
01:20:34.110 --> 01:20:34.120 align:start position:0%
yes yes sir and and on the breastfeeding
 
01:20:35.910 --> 01:20:35.920 align:start position:0%
station I understand that's also
 
01:20:38.070 --> 01:20:38.080 align:start position:0%
available to the public if they're on
 
01:20:40.229 --> 01:20:40.239 align:start position:0%
the complex and they need the Privacy
 
01:20:43.149 --> 01:20:43.159 align:start position:0%
that that station in the L offers so
 
01:20:45.030 --> 01:20:45.040 align:start position:0%
it's not just for
 
01:20:48.149 --> 01:20:48.159 align:start position:0%
Representatives um and I I meant to look
 
01:20:51.189 --> 01:20:51.199 align:start position:0%
into the nurse I the nurses I think make
 
01:20:53.270 --> 01:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
sense from an emergent perspective
 
01:20:55.310 --> 01:20:55.320 align:start position:0%
because we're an elderly
 
01:20:58.189 --> 01:20:58.199 align:start position:0%
a group of people and just last session
 
01:21:00.510 --> 01:21:00.520 align:start position:0%
we had somebody who thought they were
 
01:21:03.550 --> 01:21:03.560 align:start position:0%
having a a heart problem in session so I
 
01:21:06.030 --> 01:21:06.040 align:start position:0%
think there's kind of an an emergency
 
01:21:08.830 --> 01:21:08.840 align:start position:0%
part of that um but I don't know to what
 
01:21:12.590 --> 01:21:12.600 align:start position:0%
extent we're supposed to by policy not
 
01:21:16.110 --> 01:21:16.120 align:start position:0%
practice but by policy lean on the nurse
 
01:21:18.590 --> 01:21:18.600 align:start position:0%
for things other than when we're on
 
01:21:20.470 --> 01:21:20.480 align:start position:0%
campus and we have an emergency I just
 
01:21:22.310 --> 01:21:22.320 align:start position:0%
don't I haven't had a chance to research
 
01:21:25.709 --> 01:21:25.719 align:start position:0%
that but uh I will
 
01:21:28.790 --> 01:21:28.800 align:start position:0%
all right do you have any final words of
 
01:21:30.910 --> 01:21:30.920 align:start position:0%
wisdom I think you you kind of got a
 
01:21:33.110 --> 01:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
sense of where we're at thank you for
 
01:21:35.669 --> 01:21:35.679 align:start position:0%
your time today and thank you I know I
 
01:21:37.430 --> 01:21:37.440 align:start position:0%
know this is important to
 
01:21:41.550 --> 01:21:41.560 align:start position:0%
you I I've had EA pre programs offered
 
01:21:44.750 --> 01:21:44.760 align:start position:0%
in my corporate past and I understand
 
01:21:48.149 --> 01:21:48.159 align:start position:0%
and appreciate and value the the benefit
 
01:21:51.390 --> 01:21:51.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:55.030 --> 01:21:55.040 align:start position:0%

Mr
 
02:06:08.629 --> 02:06:08.639 align:start position:0%
chair all right it uh being passed 2 o'
 
02:06:10.830 --> 02:06:10.840 align:start position:0%
uh we're going to come uh take division
 
02:06:13.109 --> 02:06:13.119 align:start position:0%
three out of recess and we've got four
 
02:06:17.589 --> 02:06:17.599 align:start position:0%
more bills to do this evening um and for
 
02:06:20.830 --> 02:06:20.840 align:start position:0%
those in the crowd uh and and on the
 
02:06:20.840 --> 02:06:22.470 align:start position:0%
those in the crowd uh and and on the
division

02:06:22.470 --> 02:06:22.480 align:start position:0%
division
 
02:06:26.549 --> 02:06:26.559 align:start position:0%
uh I will be surprised if we get to the
 
02:06:29.830 --> 02:06:29.840 align:start position:0%
point of any of these four where we feel
 
02:06:29.840 --> 02:06:30.990 align:start position:0%
point of any of these four where we feel
like

02:06:30.990 --> 02:06:31.000 align:start position:0%
like
 
02:06:33.669 --> 02:06:33.679 align:start position:0%
we have enough information enough
 
02:06:36.270 --> 02:06:36.280 align:start position:0%
confidence to send our recommendation to
 
02:06:40.310 --> 02:06:40.320 align:start position:0%
the full finance committee which means
 
02:06:42.830 --> 02:06:42.840 align:start position:0%
that we're in a bad spot because if we
 
02:06:46.990 --> 02:06:47.000 align:start position:0%
don't know how to get from today to
 
02:06:50.430 --> 02:06:50.440 align:start position:0%
closure on Friday that means we're
 
02:06:55.069 --> 02:06:55.079 align:start position:0%
really Limited to itls and or interim
 
02:06:58.589 --> 02:06:58.599 align:start position:0%
studies so we we have to figure out
 
02:07:02.069 --> 02:07:02.079 align:start position:0%
where we're at today so um that that's
 
02:07:05.709 --> 02:07:05.719 align:start position:0%
the challenges I see it at this point so
 
02:07:07.270 --> 02:07:07.280 align:start position:0%
I'm going to bring
 
02:07:10.629 --> 02:07:10.639 align:start position:0%

02:08:32.470 --> 02:08:32.480 align:start position:0%
an amendment do we have an does anyone
 
02:08:35.030 --> 02:08:35.040 align:start position:0%
know if we have an amendment to 1588
 
02:08:36.629 --> 02:08:36.639 align:start position:0%
that we're considering today that's
 
02:08:38.870 --> 02:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
already ready do you know I have one
 
02:08:40.549 --> 02:08:40.559 align:start position:0%
Amendment here representative Edwards in
 
02:08:42.069 --> 02:08:42.079 align:start position:0%
your name that is an effective date
 
02:08:44.629 --> 02:08:44.639 align:start position:0%
change looks like to one July 25 that's
 
02:08:47.750 --> 02:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
all it is that's yes okay why why don't
 
02:08:50.270 --> 02:08:50.280 align:start position:0%
you just hand that out and we'll keep
 
02:08:53.149 --> 02:08:53.159 align:start position:0%
talking um um all right so I think we're
 
02:08:55.750 --> 02:08:55.760 align:start position:0%
in sync we're we're we're talking about
 
02:09:01.069 --> 02:09:01.079 align:start position:0%
1588 and with a different um effective
 
02:09:03.950 --> 02:09:03.960 align:start position:0%
date so would you like us to get started
 
02:09:07.069 --> 02:09:07.079 align:start position:0%
yeah go ahead and us so um essentially
 
02:09:09.830 --> 02:09:09.840 align:start position:0%
our our feeling is that um 1588
 
02:09:13.030 --> 02:09:13.040 align:start position:0%
addresses a gap that came about um
 
02:09:14.990 --> 02:09:15.000 align:start position:0%
recently within the last two years the
 
02:09:17.109 --> 02:09:17.119 align:start position:0%
age of eligibility for special education
 
02:09:22.470 --> 02:09:22.480 align:start position:0%
was raised to 22 years um and so 1588
 
02:09:24.109 --> 02:09:24.119 align:start position:0%
addresses the fact that if a student's
 
02:09:26.229 --> 02:09:26.239 align:start position:0%
out in placement a court ordered
 
02:09:29.030 --> 02:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
placement for abuse and neglect um the
 
02:09:32.109 --> 02:09:32.119 align:start position:0%
court uh is required to um discontinue
 
02:09:34.669 --> 02:09:34.679 align:start position:0%
involvement at 21 this would permit the
 
02:09:37.189 --> 02:09:37.199 align:start position:0%
court to stay involved up through
 
02:09:42.390 --> 02:09:42.400 align:start position:0%
22 um and um we understand that uh costs
 
02:09:46.990 --> 02:09:47.000 align:start position:0%
were brought forward um with 32 students
 
02:09:49.430 --> 02:09:49.440 align:start position:0%
potentially falling into this category
 
02:09:52.229 --> 02:09:52.239 align:start position:0%
which we think is a little bit generous
 
02:09:53.790 --> 02:09:53.800 align:start position:0%
in the sense that that's all of the
 
02:09:55.669 --> 02:09:55.679 align:start position:0%
students who would continue to be
 
02:09:57.310 --> 02:09:57.320 align:start position:0%
eligible We Believe for special
 
02:09:59.709 --> 02:09:59.719 align:start position:0%
education up through 22 these are
 
02:10:01.270 --> 02:10:01.280 align:start position:0%
students who are typically pretty
 
02:10:03.270 --> 02:10:03.280 align:start position:0%
significantly disabled and really have
 
02:10:06.430 --> 02:10:06.440 align:start position:0%
complex needs so if a child for example
 
02:10:08.750 --> 02:10:08.760 align:start position:0%
couldn't live at home a child with a
 
02:10:11.229 --> 02:10:11.239 align:start position:0%
developmental disability autism for
 
02:10:14.069 --> 02:10:14.079 align:start position:0%
example and was you know uh aggressive
 
02:10:16.430 --> 02:10:16.440 align:start position:0%
and and the parents couldn't manage them
 
02:10:19.270 --> 02:10:19.280 align:start position:0%
the courts would place them uh out and
 
02:10:21.310 --> 02:10:21.320 align:start position:0%
they would continue to re receive
 
02:10:23.310 --> 02:10:23.320 align:start position:0%
special ed up through 22 but if the
 
02:10:25.669 --> 02:10:25.679 align:start position:0%
court shuts off involvement at 21 they
 
02:10:28.310 --> 02:10:28.320 align:start position:0%
lose their placement so our feeling is
 
02:10:29.910 --> 02:10:29.920 align:start position:0%
that the costs would just shift to
 
02:10:33.669 --> 02:10:33.679 align:start position:0%
another section of DHHS because then it
 
02:10:35.589 --> 02:10:35.599 align:start position:0%
would the child would have to make sort
 
02:10:39.229 --> 02:10:39.239 align:start position:0%
of a Hoban decision um the state current
 
02:10:41.750 --> 02:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
or DHHS currently has a policy where a
 
02:10:43.470 --> 02:10:43.480 align:start position:0%
student cannot have
 
02:10:45.870 --> 02:10:45.880 align:start position:0%
placement uh if the students's receiving
 
02:10:47.950 --> 02:10:47.960 align:start position:0%
special education so the child has to
 
02:10:50.069 --> 02:10:50.079 align:start position:0%
drop out of special education in order
 
02:10:53.270 --> 02:10:53.280 align:start position:0%
to have a Community Based placement so
 
02:10:55.350 --> 02:10:55.360 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of it's kind it's hard to
 
02:10:57.270 --> 02:10:57.280 align:start position:0%
explain but there's a lot of challenges
 
02:10:59.149 --> 02:10:59.159 align:start position:0%
and and it really disrupts the lives of
 
02:11:04.189 --> 02:11:04.199 align:start position:0%
a child um in the short run um and uh
 
02:11:07.109 --> 02:11:07.119 align:start position:0%
makes you know really disrupts their
 
02:11:10.189 --> 02:11:10.199 align:start position:0%
life essentially so so I asked uh my
 
02:11:13.549 --> 02:11:13.559 align:start position:0%
vice chair representative Marine money
 
02:11:16.709 --> 02:11:16.719 align:start position:0%
to uh take a fresh look at this before
 
02:11:18.870 --> 02:11:18.880 align:start position:0%
she went on vacation and I'm I'm I'm
 
02:11:20.790 --> 02:11:20.800 align:start position:0%
sure this was the last thing she thought
 
02:11:20.800 --> 02:11:21.870 align:start position:0%
sure this was the last thing she thought
of

02:11:21.870 --> 02:11:21.880 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:11:25.950 --> 02:11:25.960 align:start position:0%
but I had her go back and and take a
 
02:11:28.950 --> 02:11:28.960 align:start position:0%
take into consideration that in Prior
 
02:11:32.189 --> 02:11:32.199 align:start position:0%
terms we've been changing parts of our
 
02:11:35.549 --> 02:11:35.559 align:start position:0%
law to bring it up to the this new age
 
02:11:39.270 --> 02:11:39.280 align:start position:0%
standard right and and so the question I
 
02:11:42.750 --> 02:11:42.760 align:start position:0%
I I put to her uh was you know just give
 
02:11:46.030 --> 02:11:46.040 align:start position:0%
me your your best assessment on whether
 
02:11:48.109 --> 02:11:48.119 align:start position:0%
or not we really have a choice at this
 
02:11:50.310 --> 02:11:50.320 align:start position:0%
point on whether or not we should pass
 
02:11:52.629 --> 02:11:52.639 align:start position:0%
this bill because it's now just an issue
 
02:11:55.270 --> 02:11:55.280 align:start position:0%
of getting our laws aligned as opposed
 
02:11:59.350 --> 02:11:59.360 align:start position:0%
to this being new policy really um and
 
02:12:01.390 --> 02:12:01.400 align:start position:0%
she said we can either do one of two
 
02:12:03.470 --> 02:12:03.480 align:start position:0%
things we could either go ahead and pass
 
02:12:06.669 --> 02:12:06.679 align:start position:0%
this or we could go back and refight the
 
02:12:08.750 --> 02:12:08.760 align:start position:0%
fights of the last couple of terms that
 
02:12:11.790 --> 02:12:11.800 align:start position:0%
change the age to begin with and so I I
 
02:12:14.950 --> 02:12:14.960 align:start position:0%
don't I don't care to do that so so we
 
02:12:18.510 --> 02:12:18.520 align:start position:0%
have a a narrower U uh decision I think
 
02:12:21.229 --> 02:12:21.239 align:start position:0%
to make uh representative Stringer
 
02:12:24.549 --> 02:12:24.559 align:start position:0%
earlier you mentioned some votes on uh
 
02:12:27.430 --> 02:12:27.440 align:start position:0%
on a bill on what it happened to it in
 
02:12:29.310 --> 02:12:29.320 align:start position:0%
the house could you do you happen to
 
02:12:32.510 --> 02:12:32.520 align:start position:0%
have that for this bill I do it uh it
 
02:12:32.520 --> 02:12:33.270 align:start position:0%
have that for this bill I do it uh it
was

02:12:33.270 --> 02:12:33.280 align:start position:0%
was
 
02:12:37.629 --> 02:12:37.639 align:start position:0%
120 uh out of committee and
 
02:12:40.990 --> 02:12:41.000 align:start position:0%
um uh let's see I think the table failed
 
02:12:43.430 --> 02:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
187 to 188 and then say say that again
 
02:12:47.149 --> 02:12:47.159 align:start position:0%
the table motion failed 187 to 188 and
 
02:12:50.390 --> 02:12:50.400 align:start position:0%
then I was pass pass on Voice v okay I
 
02:12:52.790 --> 02:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
didn't realize it was a tbling motion
 
02:12:56.069 --> 02:12:56.079 align:start position:0%
yeah so that was pretty close so um I'm
 
02:12:59.390 --> 02:12:59.400 align:start position:0%
going to bounce over to Mr White um the
 
02:13:01.950 --> 02:13:01.960 align:start position:0%
the the thing that flagged this is the
 
02:13:06.390 --> 02:13:06.400 align:start position:0%
was the broad uh Financial estimate of
 
02:13:12.069 --> 02:13:12.079 align:start position:0%
about 1.6 million to 5.76 million and I
 
02:13:13.790 --> 02:13:13.800 align:start position:0%
I think what I recall hearing in
 
02:13:16.470 --> 02:13:16.480 align:start position:0%
previous work sessions is that as more
 
02:13:18.430 --> 02:13:18.440 align:start position:0%
time has gone on more discussion has
 
02:13:21.790 --> 02:13:21.800 align:start position:0%
gone on the this cost estimate may have
 
02:13:25.109 --> 02:13:25.119 align:start position:0%
settled into a a more definitive
 
02:13:28.109 --> 02:13:28.119 align:start position:0%
narrower range is is that true and if so
 
02:13:31.629 --> 02:13:31.639 align:start position:0%
what what can you say about that uh no
 
02:13:33.830 --> 02:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
no I I I believe the conversation we had
 
02:13:36.229 --> 02:13:36.239 align:start position:0%
relative to that was on a different bill
 
02:13:39.510 --> 02:13:39.520 align:start position:0%
um the the reason in this case why we
 
02:13:42.109 --> 02:13:42.119 align:start position:0%
provided such a wide cost range is
 
02:13:44.790 --> 02:13:44.800 align:start position:0%
because a we're expanding the
 
02:13:46.990 --> 02:13:47.000 align:start position:0%
population um we're we're adding an
 
02:13:48.430 --> 02:13:48.440 align:start position:0%
additional year and yes all of those
 
02:13:50.109 --> 02:13:50.119 align:start position:0%
individuals currently would be receiving
 
02:13:52.229 --> 02:13:52.239 align:start position:0%
services but we are also going to have
 
02:13:54.109 --> 02:13:54.119 align:start position:0%
individuals coming into the system on
 
02:13:55.830 --> 02:13:55.840 align:start position:0%
the other end which is why we basically
 
02:13:58.510 --> 02:13:58.520 align:start position:0%
straight line the estimate um and we
 
02:14:01.910 --> 02:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
don't know what service type new
 
02:14:04.030 --> 02:14:04.040 align:start position:0%
individuals coming into the system would
 
02:14:07.189 --> 02:14:07.199 align:start position:0%
need which is why we have um the the
 
02:14:09.350 --> 02:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
various service types listed in the
 
02:14:12.750 --> 02:14:12.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal note um on the last page and and
 
02:14:14.870 --> 02:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
that's why we you know for residential
 
02:14:17.270 --> 02:14:17.280 align:start position:0%
right I pause
 
02:14:21.430 --> 02:14:21.440 align:start position:0%
there so great okay okay I didn't mean
 
02:14:23.109 --> 02:14:23.119 align:start position:0%
to cut you off I was just agreeing with
 
02:14:25.629 --> 02:14:25.639 align:start position:0%
you okay nope I would just basically
 
02:14:27.390 --> 02:14:27.400 align:start position:0%
speak to the if you look at the table on
 
02:14:29.750 --> 02:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
the last page you will see the the
 
02:14:32.510 --> 02:14:32.520 align:start position:0%
variation um or the the the various
 
02:14:36.390 --> 02:14:36.400 align:start position:0%
estimates that that still
 
02:14:39.910 --> 02:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
remain okay could I ask a question go
 
02:14:43.750 --> 02:14:43.760 align:start position:0%
ahead of Mr White um is that the net
 
02:14:46.189 --> 02:14:46.199 align:start position:0%
cost or the gross cost meaning is that
 
02:14:48.629 --> 02:14:48.639 align:start position:0%
including the reimbursements the state
 
02:14:50.069 --> 02:14:50.079 align:start position:0%
would get from Medicaid for these
 
02:14:51.990 --> 02:14:52.000 align:start position:0%
placements which the state currently
 
02:14:53.910 --> 02:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
won't place a child in a placement
 
02:14:57.189 --> 02:14:57.199 align:start position:0%
unless it's Medicaid approved so the
 
02:14:59.510 --> 02:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
state gets funding back in our
 
02:15:01.310 --> 02:15:01.320 align:start position:0%
experience there's really not a chance
 
02:15:03.229 --> 02:15:03.239 align:start position:0%
that there are 32 kids out there this is
 
02:15:05.950 --> 02:15:05.960 align:start position:0%
a really rare occurrence so it's very
 
02:15:07.870 --> 02:15:07.880 align:start position:0%
few students annually that fall into
 
02:15:11.229 --> 02:15:11.239 align:start position:0%
this situation um so I guess looking at
 
02:15:13.430 --> 02:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
that you know very large amount of
 
02:15:15.510 --> 02:15:15.520 align:start position:0%
funding that was estimated does that
 
02:15:17.430 --> 02:15:17.440 align:start position:0%
include the Medicaid reimbursements or
 
02:15:19.870 --> 02:15:19.880 align:start position:0%
not in the fiscal note we noted that we
 
02:15:21.830 --> 02:15:21.840 align:start position:0%
were assuming this is 100 % General
 
02:15:25.189 --> 02:15:25.199 align:start position:0%
funds in this case so it doesn't include
 
02:15:26.790 --> 02:15:26.800 align:start position:0%
the it does
 
02:15:29.149 --> 02:15:29.159 align:start position:0%
okay all right then it wouldn't so the
 
02:15:31.470 --> 02:15:31.480 align:start position:0%
state will get reimbursement for some of
 
02:15:33.430 --> 02:15:33.440 align:start position:0%
this through because of all the
 
02:15:35.470 --> 02:15:35.480 align:start position:0%
placements are Medicaid approved and
 
02:15:38.549 --> 02:15:38.559 align:start position:0%
these are students that similarly to um
 
02:15:40.669 --> 02:15:40.679 align:start position:0%
if they had their own private insurance
 
02:15:44.470 --> 02:15:44.480 align:start position:0%
the state could recoup funds that way um
 
02:15:46.589 --> 02:15:46.599 align:start position:0%
but again it's such a rare occurrence
 
02:15:48.709 --> 02:15:48.719 align:start position:0%
and it has such a huge impact on each
 
02:15:48.719 --> 02:15:49.910 align:start position:0%
and it has such a huge impact on each
individual

02:15:49.910 --> 02:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
individual
 
02:15:54.189 --> 02:15:54.199 align:start position:0%
student Mr Wy if you if you had more
 
02:15:57.229 --> 02:15:57.239 align:start position:0%
time would do you think uh that could be
 
02:16:00.430 --> 02:16:00.440 align:start position:0%
used to make this fiscal note more
 
02:16:02.709 --> 02:16:02.719 align:start position:0%
precise uh because it sounds like there
 
02:16:05.629 --> 02:16:05.639 align:start position:0%
may be an opportunity to net some money
 
02:16:08.510 --> 02:16:08.520 align:start position:0%
with Medicaid and private insurance I I
 
02:16:10.390 --> 02:16:10.400 align:start position:0%
I can take it back to the team we can CL
 
02:16:12.669 --> 02:16:12.679 align:start position:0%
take a closer look at this um as we've
 
02:16:15.310 --> 02:16:15.320 align:start position:0%
noted previously we prepared 160 fiscal
 
02:16:17.390 --> 02:16:17.400 align:start position:0%
notes um in a pretty short time frame
 
02:16:19.470 --> 02:16:19.480 align:start position:0%
this year um so I'm more than willing to
 
02:16:21.030 --> 02:16:21.040 align:start position:0%
go back and take a closer look at this
 
02:16:24.709 --> 02:16:24.719 align:start position:0%
to see if if we can revise any of
 
02:16:27.830 --> 02:16:27.840 align:start position:0%
this all right is there any other
 
02:16:30.189 --> 02:16:30.199 align:start position:0%
discussion any thoughts on this I you
 
02:16:32.110 --> 02:16:32.120 align:start position:0%
now know what where I'm at and what I'm
 
02:16:35.309 --> 02:16:35.319 align:start position:0%
thinking go ahead represent
 
02:16:38.469 --> 02:16:38.479 align:start position:0%
wner so I think this is something I
 
02:16:41.589 --> 02:16:41.599 align:start position:0%
thought I heard the um two women at the
 
02:16:45.709 --> 02:16:45.719 align:start position:0%
at the table say and that is
 
02:16:48.830 --> 02:16:48.840 align:start position:0%
that many of these
 
02:16:53.429 --> 02:16:53.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:57.870 --> 02:16:57.880 align:start position:0%
will become eligible for other programs
 
02:17:01.549 --> 02:17:01.559 align:start position:0%
that the state offers so if they aren't
 
02:17:04.469 --> 02:17:04.479 align:start position:0%
in this bucket if they aren't here they
 
02:17:07.549 --> 02:17:07.559 align:start position:0%
would show up someplace else correct
 
02:17:07.559 --> 02:17:09.070 align:start position:0%
would show up someplace else correct
essentially

02:17:09.070 --> 02:17:09.080 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
02:17:12.509 --> 02:17:12.519 align:start position:0%
so that's an offset financially
 
02:17:16.230 --> 02:17:16.240 align:start position:0%
also kind of so what happens is when the
 
02:17:18.790 --> 02:17:18.800 align:start position:0%
student ages out of the Court placement
 
02:17:22.270 --> 02:17:22.280 align:start position:0%
at 21 currently they have two options
 
02:17:24.349 --> 02:17:24.359 align:start position:0%
one is either they reject special
 
02:17:26.309 --> 02:17:26.319 align:start position:0%
education services and then can be
 
02:17:27.509 --> 02:17:27.519 align:start position:0%
picked up by
 
02:17:30.190 --> 02:17:30.200 align:start position:0%
DHHS um per RSA
 
02:17:33.270 --> 02:17:33.280 align:start position:0%
171a so they can be picked up and funded
 
02:17:34.950 --> 02:17:34.960 align:start position:0%
continuing Adult Services through that
 
02:17:36.870 --> 02:17:36.880 align:start position:0%
Avenue or they're picked up by the
 
02:17:38.709 --> 02:17:38.719 align:start position:0%
school and may lose that residential
 
02:17:40.309 --> 02:17:40.319 align:start position:0%
placement and may be back into the
 
02:17:41.790 --> 02:17:41.800 align:start position:0%
school setting or a variety of different
 
02:17:44.150 --> 02:17:44.160 align:start position:0%
other things for one year while until
 
02:17:46.790 --> 02:17:46.800 align:start position:0%
they're 22 and then can do the Community
 
02:17:46.800 --> 02:17:49.709 align:start position:0%
they're 22 and then can do the Community
Based

02:17:49.709 --> 02:17:49.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:51.349 --> 02:17:51.359 align:start position:0%
Services okay
 
02:17:51.359 --> 02:17:54.349 align:start position:0%
Services okay
thank

02:17:54.349 --> 02:17:54.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:57.790 --> 02:17:57.800 align:start position:0%
you qu question represent Stringham um
 
02:18:00.230 --> 02:18:00.240 align:start position:0%
just just with with 30 I I would hope
 
02:18:03.389 --> 02:18:03.399 align:start position:0%
that we um you know maybe if we we knew
 
02:18:07.709 --> 02:18:07.719 align:start position:0%
what the 21y old level of service was um
 
02:18:09.429 --> 02:18:09.439 align:start position:0%
you know I I understand they could all
 
02:18:12.709 --> 02:18:12.719 align:start position:0%
be the most severe all be the most least
 
02:18:15.190 --> 02:18:15.200 align:start position:0%
severe in terms of services used but
 
02:18:18.110 --> 02:18:18.120 align:start position:0%
there's probably a statistical average
 
02:18:19.549 --> 02:18:19.559 align:start position:0%
that would give us a little tighter
 
02:18:22.270 --> 02:18:22.280 align:start position:0%
range than one and a half million to 5 a
 
02:18:25.150 --> 02:18:25.160 align:start position:0%
half million or whatever the the note
 
02:18:29.429 --> 02:18:29.439 align:start position:0%
said uh if in the uh course of of of
 
02:18:31.669 --> 02:18:31.679 align:start position:0%
your revisions on the note if you could
 
02:18:32.950 --> 02:18:32.960 align:start position:0%
if you could look and see if
 
02:18:34.509 --> 02:18:34.519 align:start position:0%
statistically if you could tighten up
 
02:18:37.750 --> 02:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:40.389 --> 02:18:40.399 align:start position:0%
helpful so so I'm going to ask you a
 
02:18:42.709 --> 02:18:42.719 align:start position:0%
really dumb question to just prove that
 
02:18:45.509 --> 02:18:45.519 align:start position:0%
there really are stupid questions look
 
02:18:48.190 --> 02:18:48.200 align:start position:0%
looking at the table there's a column
 
02:18:48.200 --> 02:18:49.469 align:start position:0%
looking at the table there's a column
for

02:18:49.469 --> 02:18:49.479 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:18:53.429 --> 02:18:53.439 align:start position:0%
fy2 if it it if we change take the
 
02:18:55.509 --> 02:18:55.519 align:start position:0%
amendment and push us out into the new
 
02:18:58.950 --> 02:18:58.960 align:start position:0%
budget cycle July 125 does that
 
02:19:01.629 --> 02:19:01.639 align:start position:0%
eliminate the fy2 column and then we're
 
02:19:08.589 --> 02:19:08.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:11.910 --> 02:19:11.920 align:start position:0%
27 yes
 
02:19:14.950 --> 02:19:14.960 align:start position:0%
but whether you would want the positions
 
02:19:16.589 --> 02:19:16.599 align:start position:0%
if any appropriation at all was going to
 
02:19:19.469 --> 02:19:19.479 align:start position:0%
be provided for the additional case load
 
02:19:21.309 --> 02:19:21.319 align:start position:0%
um those positions it would probably
 
02:19:22.429 --> 02:19:22.439 align:start position:0%
take the Department administrative
 
02:19:24.870 --> 02:19:24.880 align:start position:0%
Services 30 to 90 days to establish the
 
02:19:26.270 --> 02:19:26.280 align:start position:0%
positions then there'd be some time
 
02:19:29.589 --> 02:19:29.599 align:start position:0%
before we able to hire them as well so
 
02:19:32.389 --> 02:19:32.399 align:start position:0%
there would be no cost um if positions
 
02:19:35.110 --> 02:19:35.120 align:start position:0%
were considered um we would probably
 
02:19:37.110 --> 02:19:37.120 align:start position:0%
want those available to start day one
 
02:19:38.910 --> 02:19:38.920 align:start position:0%
but again individuals would be aging
 
02:19:42.270 --> 02:19:42.280 align:start position:0%
into the system so it may be perfectly
 
02:19:46.629 --> 02:19:46.639 align:start position:0%
fine okay um so now I have a question
 
02:19:47.509 --> 02:19:47.519 align:start position:0%
for the
 
02:19:49.630 --> 02:19:49.640 align:start position:0%
chair representative
 
02:19:49.640 --> 02:19:51.429 align:start position:0%
chair representative
wer

02:19:51.429 --> 02:19:51.439 align:start position:0%
wer
 
02:19:56.110 --> 02:19:56.120 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm reasonably confident that
 
02:19:59.950 --> 02:19:59.960 align:start position:0%
this um fiscal note is is is a little
 
02:20:02.230 --> 02:20:02.240 align:start position:0%
high it's truly representative of a
 
02:20:05.630 --> 02:20:05.640 align:start position:0%
worst case scenario and and and I and I
 
02:20:09.030 --> 02:20:09.040 align:start position:0%
think if Mr White had the time and space
 
02:20:12.270 --> 02:20:12.280 align:start position:0%
to look at this it would probably reduce
 
02:20:17.710 --> 02:20:17.720 align:start position:0%
this fiscal note um so I I I I have some
 
02:20:20.030 --> 02:20:20.040 align:start position:0%
reluctance passing something out of
 
02:20:21.910 --> 02:20:21.920 align:start position:0%
division three to the full committee
 
02:20:25.510 --> 02:20:25.520 align:start position:0%
without it being fully cooked and and
 
02:20:27.750 --> 02:20:27.760 align:start position:0%
and now telling you where I think we're
 
02:20:31.550 --> 02:20:31.560 align:start position:0%
at with this and you receiving this from
 
02:20:35.550 --> 02:20:35.560 align:start position:0%
us how comfortable would you be that we
 
02:20:37.790 --> 02:20:37.800 align:start position:0%
still don't we have a squishy fiscal
 
02:20:37.800 --> 02:20:40.030 align:start position:0%
still don't we have a squishy fiscal
note

02:20:40.030 --> 02:20:40.040 align:start position:0%
note
 
02:20:43.990 --> 02:20:44.000 align:start position:0%
here if we do that
 
02:20:46.270 --> 02:20:46.280 align:start position:0%
microphone if we do then maybe interim
 
02:20:48.790 --> 02:20:48.800 align:start position:0%
study is is the way to go until we have
 
02:20:50.870 --> 02:20:50.880 align:start position:0%
a firmer idea what's happening because
 
02:20:53.469 --> 02:20:53.479 align:start position:0%
there's some things that are kind of in
 
02:20:55.910 --> 02:20:55.920 align:start position:0%
in process of going through the 21 to
 
02:20:58.190 --> 02:20:58.200 align:start position:0%
the 22 makes how many students do it
 
02:21:01.510 --> 02:21:01.520 align:start position:0%
apply to and those data we we don't have
 
02:21:07.630 --> 02:21:07.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:10.349 --> 02:21:10.359 align:start position:0%
walner well I I guess a lot of it hinges
 
02:21:13.830 --> 02:21:13.840 align:start position:0%
for me I mean a lot of this fiscal note
 
02:21:17.030 --> 02:21:17.040 align:start position:0%
really hinges on the numbers of students
 
02:21:19.750 --> 02:21:19.760 align:start position:0%
we're talking about and it seems like we
 
02:21:23.110 --> 02:21:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:26.309 --> 02:21:26.319 align:start position:0%
how many 21 year olds there are
 
02:21:29.030 --> 02:21:29.040 align:start position:0%
now it feels like we should be able to
 
02:21:30.910 --> 02:21:30.920 align:start position:0%
get that figure so we would have a
 
02:21:34.790 --> 02:21:34.800 align:start position:0%
really closer estimate of how many
 
02:21:38.190 --> 02:21:38.200 align:start position:0%
would come to us in the next year so I
 
02:21:41.630 --> 02:21:41.640 align:start position:0%
think and also I well I was also going
 
02:21:43.990 --> 02:21:44.000 align:start position:0%
back to we we briefly at one point
 
02:21:47.630 --> 02:21:47.640 align:start position:0%
talked about um needing more casew
 
02:21:51.630 --> 02:21:51.640 align:start position:0%
workers if there are 32 yeah yes you
 
02:21:55.190 --> 02:21:55.200 align:start position:0%
might if there are many less than
 
02:21:58.429 --> 02:21:58.439 align:start position:0%
that you maybe would need less case
 
02:22:02.230 --> 02:22:02.240 align:start position:0%
workers or an adjustment in the um
 
02:22:05.630 --> 02:22:05.640 align:start position:0%
Staffing so um it seems to me a lot of
 
02:22:08.910 --> 02:22:08.920 align:start position:0%
it hinges on the number of students that
 
02:22:11.710 --> 02:22:11.720 align:start position:0%
fall into this category I I think your
 
02:22:14.070 --> 02:22:14.080 align:start position:0%
point is brilliant if we knew how many
 
02:22:16.270 --> 02:22:16.280 align:start position:0%
21y olds there were we would know how
 
02:22:19.030 --> 02:22:19.040 align:start position:0%
many projected 22 year olds will be
 
02:22:21.190 --> 02:22:21.200 align:start position:0%
right U but except I think I'm hearing
 
02:22:23.750 --> 02:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
Mr White say that there's a new category
 
02:22:25.190 --> 02:22:25.200 align:start position:0%
of of
 
02:22:28.070 --> 02:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
incremental additions that it isn't just
 
02:22:31.950 --> 02:22:31.960 align:start position:0%
continuation am I did I mishear you is
 
02:22:34.750 --> 02:22:34.760 align:start position:0%
it do the 21 year olds continue they
 
02:22:37.910 --> 02:22:37.920 align:start position:0%
represent the Next Generation or is
 
02:22:42.070 --> 02:22:42.080 align:start position:0%
there also an influx of newly eligible
 
02:22:45.230 --> 02:22:45.240 align:start position:0%
the the the 32 number listed in in the
 
02:22:47.590 --> 02:22:47.600 align:start position:0%
second paragraph on page one that that
 
02:22:50.110 --> 02:22:50.120 align:start position:0%
is the estimate that we utilized based
 
02:22:52.429 --> 02:22:52.439 align:start position:0%
on the information that we had available
 
02:22:53.990 --> 02:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
again I can take this back and I can
 
02:22:55.630 --> 02:22:55.640 align:start position:0%
verify with the team how they arrived
 
02:22:57.429 --> 02:22:57.439 align:start position:0%
that number and whether they Ed real
 
02:23:00.190 --> 02:23:00.200 align:start position:0%
case count data which I assume they did
 
02:23:02.349 --> 02:23:02.359 align:start position:0%
um to to arrive at that figure and I
 
02:23:03.469 --> 02:23:03.479 align:start position:0%
think that's the key driver as
 
02:23:05.790 --> 02:23:05.800 align:start position:0%
representative wner suely pointed out
 
02:23:09.270 --> 02:23:09.280 align:start position:0%
right so so go ahead represent wner well
 
02:23:12.550 --> 02:23:12.560 align:start position:0%
I I thought I also heard um them say
 
02:23:16.469 --> 02:23:16.479 align:start position:0%
that at when they go into that I never
 
02:23:18.550 --> 02:23:18.560 align:start position:0%
know if it's you're going into the 21st
 
02:23:21.590 --> 02:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
year or the 22nd year but that ex that
 
02:23:23.830 --> 02:23:23.840 align:start position:0%
new year that they're eligible for that
 
02:23:27.429 --> 02:23:27.439 align:start position:0%
they can actually opt not everyone would
 
02:23:30.429 --> 02:23:30.439 align:start position:0%
opt for that so it's a very small I
 
02:23:33.830 --> 02:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
think I think it's a very small am I
 
02:23:35.990 --> 02:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
interrupting it's a yeah it's a very
 
02:23:39.070 --> 02:23:39.080 align:start position:0%
small number so um it's it's for
 
02:23:41.110 --> 02:23:41.120 align:start position:0%
students that are not going to earn a
 
02:23:43.230 --> 02:23:43.240 align:start position:0%
regular high school diploma and it's
 
02:23:45.510 --> 02:23:45.520 align:start position:0%
students that have not work you know got
 
02:23:49.070 --> 02:23:49.080 align:start position:0%
earned the credits um and so it's I
 
02:23:51.309 --> 02:23:51.319 align:start position:0%
think 32 encompasses is all of the
 
02:23:54.190 --> 02:23:54.200 align:start position:0%
students in the state so it's very rare
 
02:23:56.269 --> 02:23:56.279 align:start position:0%
that we have a child in a placement
 
02:23:58.550 --> 02:23:58.560 align:start position:0%
where this has occurred it has it hasn't
 
02:24:00.190 --> 02:24:00.200 align:start position:0%
happened more than you know once or
 
02:24:02.670 --> 02:24:02.680 align:start position:0%
twice with groups annually I can't
 
02:24:05.309 --> 02:24:05.319 align:start position:0%
imagine requiring additional Staffing
 
02:24:08.230 --> 02:24:08.240 align:start position:0%
because if we raised it to 22 the
 
02:24:10.230 --> 02:24:10.240 align:start position:0%
schools would continue to case manage
 
02:24:11.830 --> 02:24:11.840 align:start position:0%
because special ed would still be in
 
02:24:14.590 --> 02:24:14.600 align:start position:0%
place so that would you know I I can't
 
02:24:17.670 --> 02:24:17.680 align:start position:0%
imagine hiring new Staffing for you know
 
02:24:20.389 --> 02:24:20.399 align:start position:0%
just a few kids with very complex needs
 
02:24:22.269 --> 02:24:22.279 align:start position:0%
where the school is still case managing
 
02:24:25.150 --> 02:24:25.160 align:start position:0%
and and and funding a big portion of
 
02:24:27.590 --> 02:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
it because these are only court-ordered
 
02:24:29.550 --> 02:24:29.560 align:start position:0%
placements that are in this process not
 
02:24:31.070 --> 02:24:31.080 align:start position:0%
all 21 year
 
02:24:34.110 --> 02:24:34.120 align:start position:0%
olds so so you just raised a new one if
 
02:24:36.389 --> 02:24:36.399 align:start position:0%
if the schools are going to continue to
 
02:24:37.750 --> 02:24:37.760 align:start position:0%
manage these people and they're just
 
02:24:41.110 --> 02:24:41.120 align:start position:0%
going to have more of them total are we
 
02:24:44.070 --> 02:24:44.080 align:start position:0%
essentially uh putting a small unfunded
 
02:24:47.950 --> 02:24:47.960 align:start position:0%
mandate on our schools so I mean the
 
02:24:50.110 --> 02:24:50.120 align:start position:0%
raising it to 22 has already been done
 
02:24:52.190 --> 02:24:52.200 align:start position:0%
right so schools schools are going to
 
02:24:54.429 --> 02:24:54.439 align:start position:0%
end up managing it the problem will be
 
02:24:56.469 --> 02:24:56.479 align:start position:0%
that currently there's a policy that
 
02:25:00.429 --> 02:25:00.439 align:start position:0%
they cannot receive um special education
 
02:25:03.230 --> 02:25:03.240 align:start position:0%
if if if you know
 
02:25:07.309 --> 02:25:07.319 align:start position:0%
um if dcyf becomes involved if they're
 
02:25:09.150 --> 02:25:09.160 align:start position:0%
so they have to deny their special
 
02:25:11.190 --> 02:25:11.200 align:start position:0%
education in which case the Educators
 
02:25:13.030 --> 02:25:13.040 align:start position:0%
would step away and not be involved at
 
02:25:15.990 --> 02:25:16.000 align:start position:0%
all and then you would probably need um
 
02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:17.150 align:start position:0%
all and then you would probably need um
RSA

02:25:17.150 --> 02:25:17.160 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
02:25:19.590 --> 02:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
171a you would probably need to hire
 
02:25:21.990 --> 02:25:22.000 align:start position:0%
folks but it's really just streamlining
 
02:25:24.510 --> 02:25:24.520 align:start position:0%
things so that hire I'm looking at the
 
02:25:26.750 --> 02:25:26.760 align:start position:0%
unfunded mandate are we talking about
 
02:25:28.590 --> 02:25:28.600 align:start position:0%
hiring Folks at the school district
 
02:25:31.110 --> 02:25:31.120 align:start position:0%
level or at the state level not hiring
 
02:25:33.150 --> 02:25:33.160 align:start position:0%
anybody we would just Contin allow those
 
02:25:34.950 --> 02:25:34.960 align:start position:0%
children to stay where they are until
 
02:25:37.150 --> 02:25:37.160 align:start position:0%
they age out at 22 and the school would
 
02:25:39.110 --> 02:25:39.120 align:start position:0%
continue to provide those services and
 
02:25:42.670 --> 02:25:42.680 align:start position:0%
pay for those you know case management
 
02:25:44.870 --> 02:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
responsibilities I don't I don't know
 
02:25:47.469 --> 02:25:47.479 align:start position:0%
that I'm explaining my question well
 
02:25:51.110 --> 02:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
enough uh if we expand the work load for
 
02:25:53.750 --> 02:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
the school districts they're going to
 
02:25:56.550 --> 02:25:56.560 align:start position:0%
have more work to do often times that
 
02:26:00.150 --> 02:26:00.160 align:start position:0%
additional work could entail additional
 
02:26:04.190 --> 02:26:04.200 align:start position:0%
man hours or another position so so my
 
02:26:09.349 --> 02:26:09.359 align:start position:0%
my new question as of today is by
 
02:26:12.750 --> 02:26:12.760 align:start position:0%
passing this are we creating any kind of
 
02:26:16.190 --> 02:26:16.200 align:start position:0%
unfunded mandate at the school level uh
 
02:26:19.230 --> 02:26:19.240 align:start position:0%
are are we forcing them to spend more
 
02:26:22.750 --> 02:26:22.760 align:start position:0%
manpower to manage this program I think
 
02:26:24.269 --> 02:26:24.279 align:start position:0%
I heard you say though that this is
 
02:26:26.110 --> 02:26:26.120 align:start position:0%
already in law they're already doing it
 
02:26:28.389 --> 02:26:28.399 align:start position:0%
they've already absorbed this right soti
 
02:26:31.070 --> 02:26:31.080 align:start position:0%
so I want to hear you say that the no
 
02:26:33.790 --> 02:26:33.800 align:start position:0%
there is no unfunded mandate in this no
 
02:26:35.070 --> 02:26:35.080 align:start position:0%
there's no unfunded mandate no
 
02:26:36.830 --> 02:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
additional one there already is yeah
 
02:26:38.630 --> 02:26:38.640 align:start position:0%
they're already work the unfunded
 
02:26:40.590 --> 02:26:40.600 align:start position:0%
mandates already happen correct and it's
 
02:26:42.950 --> 02:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
such a rare occasion it's so few kids
 
02:26:45.469 --> 02:26:45.479 align:start position:0%
that you know it would just be okay I I
 
02:26:47.429 --> 02:26:47.439 align:start position:0%
I just get concerned about who's paying
 
02:26:48.670 --> 02:26:48.680 align:start position:0%
the bill yeah the unfunded mandate
 
02:26:50.750 --> 02:26:50.760 align:start position:0%
already exists this literally would be a
 
02:26:53.670 --> 02:26:53.680 align:start position:0%
couple of kids in the state so it may be
 
02:26:56.030 --> 02:26:56.040 align:start position:0%
a couple of case management hours during
 
02:26:57.550 --> 02:26:57.560 align:start position:0%
the week or year but it's not going to
 
02:26:59.950 --> 02:26:59.960 align:start position:0%
be an entire new position for somebody
 
02:27:01.510 --> 02:27:01.520 align:start position:0%
because it's purely the case management
 
02:27:03.269 --> 02:27:03.279 align:start position:0%
as these children are in court ordered
 
02:27:05.630 --> 02:27:05.640 align:start position:0%
placements so it's not a whole lot of
 
02:27:08.230 --> 02:27:08.240 align:start position:0%
man hours that go into managing these
 
02:27:11.150 --> 02:27:11.160 align:start position:0%
students okay uh thank you are there
 
02:27:14.429 --> 02:27:14.439 align:start position:0%
more questions okay so what I'd like to
 
02:27:17.309 --> 02:27:17.319 align:start position:0%
have division three consider is is I'd
 
02:27:21.349 --> 02:27:21.359 align:start position:0%
like to know if um by a show of hands if
 
02:27:23.830 --> 02:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
you're meable to making the effective
 
02:27:26.710 --> 02:27:26.720 align:start position:0%
date based on this amendment
 
02:27:30.790 --> 02:27:30.800 align:start position:0%
1091 january1 2025 that that pushes it
 
02:27:34.150 --> 02:27:34.160 align:start position:0%
off is is everyone amable to uh
 
02:27:36.870 --> 02:27:36.880 align:start position:0%
postponing the effective
 
02:27:39.590 --> 02:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
date what I'm confused because your
 
02:27:42.510 --> 02:27:42.520 align:start position:0%
Amendment says July 1 2025 that's what I
 
02:27:45.190 --> 02:27:45.200 align:start position:0%
tried to just say did I did my January
 
02:27:47.750 --> 02:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
oh so my brain misfired you just caught
 
02:27:50.590 --> 02:27:50.600 align:start position:0%
my brain misfired just double checking
 
02:27:54.389 --> 02:27:54.399 align:start position:0%
then oh my God my brain misfired and
 
02:27:57.830 --> 02:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
it's on live it's on recording so July 1
 
02:28:02.070 --> 02:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
2025 is are is everyone amable to to
 
02:28:04.230 --> 02:28:04.240 align:start position:0%
this postponement go
 
02:28:06.550 --> 02:28:06.560 align:start position:0%
ahead oh you're raising your hand so
 
02:28:08.950 --> 02:28:08.960 align:start position:0%
show of hands if you're meable to
 
02:28:15.469 --> 02:28:15.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:20.150 --> 02:28:20.160 align:start position:0%
1:25 okay all right so so then with that
 
02:28:23.269 --> 02:28:23.279 align:start position:0%
I would like to postpone for go ahead
 
02:28:28.269 --> 02:28:28.279 align:start position:0%
could I just ask I guess Nathan Mr White
 
02:28:31.790 --> 02:28:31.800 align:start position:0%
um what does that mean if we
 
02:28:35.349 --> 02:28:35.359 align:start position:0%
delay by I guess we're delaying by one
 
02:28:38.590 --> 02:28:38.600 align:start position:0%
year what's the what what does that are
 
02:28:41.750 --> 02:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
we gonna are we liable anyway for these
 
02:28:44.070 --> 02:28:44.080 align:start position:0%
students if you if you delay the
 
02:28:46.870 --> 02:28:46.880 align:start position:0%
effective date um that pushes us into
 
02:28:48.950 --> 02:28:48.960 align:start position:0%
the next budget cycle we're going to
 
02:28:50.670 --> 02:28:50.680 align:start position:0%
start to prepare
 
02:28:52.070 --> 02:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
we're already working on our budget for
 
02:28:54.269 --> 02:28:54.279 align:start position:0%
the next bium um we'll be submitting our
 
02:28:57.790 --> 02:28:57.800 align:start position:0%
budget in September um globally our
 
02:28:59.309 --> 02:28:59.319 align:start position:0%
budget is going to be increasing by
 
02:29:01.630 --> 02:29:01.640 align:start position:0%
probably $200 million General funds up
 
02:29:05.389 --> 02:29:05.399 align:start position:0%
to 20% once you fact over the prior Bia
 
02:29:07.230 --> 02:29:07.240 align:start position:0%
once you factor into the medic $134
 
02:29:09.590 --> 02:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
million of Medicaid rate increase
 
02:29:11.550 --> 02:29:11.560 align:start position:0%
probably you know the forensic unit
 
02:29:13.190 --> 02:29:13.200 align:start position:0%
coming online and there's another $25
 
02:29:17.110 --> 02:29:17.120 align:start position:0%
million there dollars there so when I'm
 
02:29:19.110 --> 02:29:19.120 align:start position:0%
when I'm setting up my budget I'm
 
02:29:21.070 --> 02:29:21.080 align:start position:0%
looking at what are the prioritize needs
 
02:29:22.550 --> 02:29:22.560 align:start position:0%
because I'm probably not going to get
 
02:29:24.750 --> 02:29:24.760 align:start position:0%
all everything into the governor's
 
02:29:27.230 --> 02:29:27.240 align:start position:0%
budget Target which may be flat zero or
 
02:29:30.030 --> 02:29:30.040 align:start position:0%
negative um I I don't I don't I don't
 
02:29:33.070 --> 02:29:33.080 align:start position:0%
know and so I think what would end up
 
02:29:35.110 --> 02:29:35.120 align:start position:0%
happening is if you put forward
 
02:29:39.429 --> 02:29:39.439 align:start position:0%
legislation like this um we would likely
 
02:29:41.469 --> 02:29:41.479 align:start position:0%
have to put forward some sort of
 
02:29:43.790 --> 02:29:43.800 align:start position:0%
prioritized need request in the next
 
02:29:46.190 --> 02:29:46.200 align:start position:0%
budget to get this funded otherwise the
 
02:29:47.590 --> 02:29:47.600 align:start position:0%
law would take effect and there would be
 
02:29:49.030 --> 02:29:49.040 align:start position:0%
no funding
 
02:29:49.040 --> 02:29:52.150 align:start position:0%
no funding
available

02:29:52.150 --> 02:29:52.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:56.710 --> 02:29:56.720 align:start position:0%
and could we ask well the same question
 
02:29:59.110 --> 02:29:59.120 align:start position:0%
so I think what's going to happen is the
 
02:30:01.349 --> 02:30:01.359 align:start position:0%
students what will happen is the state's
 
02:30:03.630 --> 02:30:03.640 align:start position:0%
going to pay either way and the student
 
02:30:05.230 --> 02:30:05.240 align:start position:0%
will just have to drop out of special
 
02:30:07.550 --> 02:30:07.560 align:start position:0%
education so education Educators would
 
02:30:09.389 --> 02:30:09.399 align:start position:0%
no longer participate and there'll be no
 
02:30:11.230 --> 02:30:11.240 align:start position:0%
case management so I think you
 
02:30:14.910 --> 02:30:14.920 align:start position:0%
conceivably could lose funding um
 
02:30:16.950 --> 02:30:16.960 align:start position:0%
because you you're going to pay for it
 
02:30:19.269 --> 02:30:19.279 align:start position:0%
either way and and and if a child has to
 
02:30:21.790 --> 02:30:21.800 align:start position:0%
drop out a speci education in order to
 
02:30:23.910 --> 02:30:23.920 align:start position:0%
continue with a placement it's it's you
 
02:30:25.429 --> 02:30:25.439 align:start position:0%
know it's going to be devastating for
 
02:30:27.429 --> 02:30:27.439 align:start position:0%
that child but it's also going to be a
 
02:30:29.269 --> 02:30:29.279 align:start position:0%
continuation and case management for the
 
02:30:30.469 --> 02:30:30.479 align:start position:0%
state they're not going to put these
 
02:30:33.469 --> 02:30:33.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:35.670 --> 02:30:35.680 align:start position:0%
street and that already exists through
 
02:30:38.269 --> 02:30:38.279 align:start position:0%
that 171a that we were talking about
 
02:30:40.269 --> 02:30:40.279 align:start position:0%
that requires the student to make that
 
02:30:41.830 --> 02:30:41.840 align:start position:0%
choice or the family to make that choice
 
02:30:44.349 --> 02:30:44.359 align:start position:0%
of either continuing that placement and
 
02:30:46.230 --> 02:30:46.240 align:start position:0%
keeping consistent services and
 
02:30:49.510 --> 02:30:49.520 align:start position:0%
placement or um and dropping out of
 
02:30:51.870 --> 02:30:51.880 align:start position:0%
special so it's it's in combination so
 
02:30:53.950 --> 02:30:53.960 align:start position:0%
they can no longer receive Services
 
02:30:55.590 --> 02:30:55.600 align:start position:0%
through the school in order to meet
 
02:31:00.550 --> 02:31:00.560 align:start position:0%
dhs's policy um for not continuing in
 
02:31:02.830 --> 02:31:02.840 align:start position:0%
school at that time in order to fund it
 
02:31:04.750 --> 02:31:04.760 align:start position:0%
and that's not legislation that's just
 
02:31:07.590 --> 02:31:07.600 align:start position:0%
policy that's policy okay so the
 
02:31:10.349 --> 02:31:10.359 align:start position:0%
Practical implication if I'm hearing it
 
02:31:11.950 --> 02:31:11.960 align:start position:0%
right from the people with the boots on
 
02:31:15.429 --> 02:31:15.439 align:start position:0%
the ground is that uh the effective date
 
02:31:17.590 --> 02:31:17.600 align:start position:0%
of this really should just go ahead and
 
02:31:19.910 --> 02:31:19.920 align:start position:0%
say effective 60 days after it's passed
 
02:31:19.920 --> 02:31:21.070 align:start position:0%
say effective 60 days after it's passed
message

02:31:21.070 --> 02:31:21.080 align:start position:0%
message
 
02:31:23.590 --> 02:31:23.600 align:start position:0%
because coming up with a different
 
02:31:27.950 --> 02:31:27.960 align:start position:0%
effective date is doesn't really impact
 
02:31:30.150 --> 02:31:30.160 align:start position:0%
reality it'll I mean the schools will
 
02:31:32.190 --> 02:31:32.200 align:start position:0%
step back and not be involved with these
 
02:31:33.750 --> 02:31:33.760 align:start position:0%
with these with these okay so I'll
 
02:31:35.269 --> 02:31:35.279 align:start position:0%
withdraw my
 
02:31:40.269 --> 02:31:40.279 align:start position:0%
Amendment okay so so on the rest of 1588
 
02:31:42.990 --> 02:31:43.000 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm uncomfortable having us pass it
 
02:31:45.110 --> 02:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
to the full finance committee without a
 
02:31:47.309 --> 02:31:47.319 align:start position:0%
little bit more precision and so since
 
02:31:50.630 --> 02:31:50.640 align:start position:0%
we can delay this till Friday I would
 
02:31:52.630 --> 02:31:52.640 align:start position:0%
like to go ahead and delay it but if we
 
02:31:54.269 --> 02:31:54.279 align:start position:0%
don't have any better
 
02:31:58.790 --> 02:31:58.800 align:start position:0%
numbers by Friday then we you know I I
 
02:32:00.309 --> 02:32:00.319 align:start position:0%
guess we have to decide then what we're
 
02:32:01.950 --> 02:32:01.960 align:start position:0%
going to do in the absence of good
 
02:32:04.230 --> 02:32:04.240 align:start position:0%
information or precise
 
02:32:07.230 --> 02:32:07.240 align:start position:0%
information is there any dispute about
 
02:32:09.429 --> 02:32:09.439 align:start position:0%
how to handle
 
02:32:12.150 --> 02:32:12.160 align:start position:0%
that representative walner so I assume
 
02:32:14.550 --> 02:32:14.560 align:start position:0%
that what we're waiting on then for our
 
02:32:16.710 --> 02:32:16.720 align:start position:0%
Friday decision is really the
 
02:32:20.070 --> 02:32:20.080 align:start position:0%
possibility of Mr White reworking I know
 
02:32:21.429 --> 02:32:21.439 align:start position:0%
he's not going to give us a new fiscal
 
02:32:24.510 --> 02:32:24.520 align:start position:0%
note official but maybe taking a look at
 
02:32:27.070 --> 02:32:27.080 align:start position:0%
the at the numbers of students and kind
 
02:32:29.910 --> 02:32:29.920 align:start position:0%
of looking at and this new information
 
02:32:33.070 --> 02:32:33.080 align:start position:0%
about not maybe needing case
 
02:32:35.590 --> 02:32:35.600 align:start position:0%
workers um that seemed like that was a
 
02:32:37.389 --> 02:32:37.399 align:start position:0%
very new piece of information that we
 
02:32:37.399 --> 02:32:38.070 align:start position:0%
very new piece of information that we
just

02:32:38.070 --> 02:32:38.080 align:start position:0%
just
 
02:32:41.710 --> 02:32:41.720 align:start position:0%
learned so that we don't need any other
 
02:32:45.670 --> 02:32:45.680 align:start position:0%
amendments to the policy I don't I don't
 
02:32:47.150 --> 02:32:47.160 align:start position:0%
think so I don't think anyone's
 
02:32:49.230 --> 02:32:49.240 align:start position:0%
advocated just working the numbers right
 
02:32:52.349 --> 02:32:52.359 align:start position:0%
I and and and I we may share this
 
02:32:54.630 --> 02:32:54.640 align:start position:0%
opinion that it's just uncomfortable for
 
02:32:57.230 --> 02:32:57.240 align:start position:0%
the committee subcommittee to pass its
 
02:32:59.309 --> 02:32:59.319 align:start position:0%
work to the full finance committee
 
02:33:00.630 --> 02:33:00.640 align:start position:0%
without some numbers that we're
 
02:33:04.910 --> 02:33:04.920 align:start position:0%
confident in yeah good thank you all
 
02:33:07.830 --> 02:33:07.840 align:start position:0%
right okay so so thank you is there
 
02:33:09.670 --> 02:33:09.680 align:start position:0%
anything that you wanted to say that you
 
02:33:11.590 --> 02:33:11.600 align:start position:0%
didn't get a chance to say no thank you
 
02:33:15.510 --> 02:33:15.520 align:start position:0%
very much thank you that's it for
 
02:33:18.830 --> 02:33:18.840 align:start position:0%
1588 uh we're going to uh try to resolve
 
02:33:20.830 --> 02:33:20.840 align:start position:0%
that on Friday
 
02:33:24.070 --> 02:33:24.080 align:start position:0%
um HB
 
02:33:27.750 --> 02:33:27.760 align:start position:0%
1593 um I understand there's an
 
02:33:32.190 --> 02:33:32.200 align:start position:0%
amendment to to this uh this is U making
 
02:33:35.070 --> 02:33:35.080 align:start position:0%
an appropriation to DHHS to support
 
02:33:37.389 --> 02:33:37.399 align:start position:0%
recreational activities for individuals
 
02:33:39.190 --> 02:33:39.200 align:start position:0%
with developmental
 
02:33:41.790 --> 02:33:41.800 align:start position:0%
disabilities um do you want to speak to
 
02:33:43.630 --> 02:33:43.640 align:start position:0%
the am I assume it's your Amendment you
 
02:33:46.269 --> 02:33:46.279 align:start position:0%
got your name on it uh it is okay do you
 
02:33:49.070 --> 02:33:49.080 align:start position:0%
want from where you're at do you want to
 
02:33:51.150 --> 02:33:51.160 align:start position:0%
do let's wait for Mickey to hand them
 
02:33:51.160 --> 02:33:52.910 align:start position:0%
do let's wait for Mickey to hand them
out

02:33:52.910 --> 02:33:52.920 align:start position:0%
out
 
02:33:56.469 --> 02:33:56.479 align:start position:0%
yep so just as a reminder this bill is
 
02:34:00.030 --> 02:34:00.040 align:start position:0%
uh about U making services available to
 
02:34:02.190 --> 02:34:02.200 align:start position:0%
those on the developmental disability
 
02:34:06.309 --> 02:34:06.319 align:start position:0%
waiver uh that uh as of June 30th uh
 
02:34:10.070 --> 02:34:10.080 align:start position:0%
they uh had expected to be part of their
 
02:34:13.510 --> 02:34:13.520 align:start position:0%
continuing program and budget but then
 
02:34:15.590 --> 02:34:15.600 align:start position:0%
um you know based on new information
 
02:34:17.230 --> 02:34:17.240 align:start position:0%
they've been
 
02:34:19.750 --> 02:34:19.760 align:start position:0%
withdrawn and those are services that
 
02:34:22.990 --> 02:34:23.000 align:start position:0%
that come come with the tag recreational
 
02:34:25.389 --> 02:34:25.399 align:start position:0%
activities uh we've talked through this
 
02:34:29.429 --> 02:34:29.439 align:start position:0%
uh uh many many times and I think from
 
02:34:31.870 --> 02:34:31.880 align:start position:0%
when first introduced in Health and
 
02:34:34.750 --> 02:34:34.760 align:start position:0%
Human Services uh and then passed there
 
02:34:37.070 --> 02:34:37.080 align:start position:0%
17 to3 and then on a Voice vote on the
 
02:34:40.070 --> 02:34:40.080 align:start position:0%
floor uh We've amended it a few more
 
02:34:44.510 --> 02:34:44.520 align:start position:0%
times uh to um and basically what this
 
02:34:46.830 --> 02:34:46.840 align:start position:0%
amendment does that wasn't in Prior
 
02:34:50.190 --> 02:34:50.200 align:start position:0%
amendments is provide uh for
 
02:34:52.670 --> 02:34:52.680 align:start position:0%
accelerated beginning of this program
 
02:34:56.230 --> 02:34:56.240 align:start position:0%
and in particular so that we have uh
 
02:34:59.469 --> 02:34:59.479 align:start position:0%
reports and information that we can act
 
02:35:01.910 --> 02:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
on what line item are you drawing our
 
02:35:09.349 --> 02:35:09.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:12.030 --> 02:35:12.040 align:start position:0%
um because this this is a replace all
 
02:35:14.830 --> 02:35:14.840 align:start position:0%
with section one so um yeah so it's hard
 
02:35:18.190 --> 02:35:18.200 align:start position:0%
to hard to pull out uh first on
 
02:35:20.990 --> 02:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
02:35:24.429 --> 02:35:24.439 align:start position:0%
uh item SE Roman numeral 7 the
 
02:35:27.110 --> 02:35:27.120 align:start position:0%
department shall enter uh issue an
 
02:35:29.429 --> 02:35:29.439 align:start position:0%
interim report to the fiscal committee
 
02:35:32.910 --> 02:35:32.920 align:start position:0%
on honor before April 1st 2025 the
 
02:35:36.070 --> 02:35:36.080 align:start position:0%
report shall include data on utilization
 
02:35:38.510 --> 02:35:38.520 align:start position:0%
the number of you uh individuals seeking
 
02:35:41.110 --> 02:35:41.120 align:start position:0%
services in accordance with paragraphs 1
 
02:35:43.389 --> 02:35:43.399 align:start position:0%
two and three the number of individuals
 
02:35:46.349 --> 02:35:46.359 align:start position:0%
provided services and the types of
 
02:35:48.750 --> 02:35:48.760 align:start position:0%
specific Services provided the total
 
02:35:51.190 --> 02:35:51.200 align:start position:0%
cost of the service provided and other
 
02:35:54.550 --> 02:35:54.560 align:start position:0%
relevant uh information uh Section 8
 
02:35:57.230 --> 02:35:57.240 align:start position:0%
also says they will issue a final report
 
02:36:01.309 --> 02:36:01.319 align:start position:0%
later on um so those are all new line 30
 
02:36:03.710 --> 02:36:03.720 align:start position:0%
down to the bottom of the bill is all
 
02:36:07.190 --> 02:36:07.200 align:start position:0%
new right and in addition line
 
02:36:09.630 --> 02:36:09.640 align:start position:0%
23 the Department of Health and Human
 
02:36:11.550 --> 02:36:11.560 align:start position:0%
Services shall contract with one or more
 
02:36:14.309 --> 02:36:14.319 align:start position:0%
organizations such as an area agency to
 
02:36:17.150 --> 02:36:17.160 align:start position:0%
assist in administering These funds with
 
02:36:18.510 --> 02:36:18.520 align:start position:0%
the approval of the governor the
 
02:36:21.030 --> 02:36:21.040 align:start position:0%
department May utilize is a sole source
 
02:36:22.830 --> 02:36:22.840 align:start position:0%
procurement method to implement
 
02:36:25.389 --> 02:36:25.399 align:start position:0%
recreational Services as quickly as
 
02:36:28.950 --> 02:36:28.960 align:start position:0%
possible uh so the the the uh I I I
 
02:36:31.710 --> 02:36:31.720 align:start position:0%
think the driving goal for having that
 
02:36:34.590 --> 02:36:34.600 align:start position:0%
process was so that we would have
 
02:36:37.110 --> 02:36:37.120 align:start position:0%
information with the next banian B
 
02:36:39.190 --> 02:36:39.200 align:start position:0%
budget cycle about what kind of services
 
02:36:42.590 --> 02:36:42.600 align:start position:0%
are being provided uh and you know begin
 
02:36:44.389 --> 02:36:44.399 align:start position:0%
to think about whether these are things
 
02:36:46.110 --> 02:36:46.120 align:start position:0%
that could fall back into the
 
02:36:48.630 --> 02:36:48.640 align:start position:0%
developmental disability waiver or
 
02:36:50.710 --> 02:36:50.720 align:start position:0%
whether uh uh they were going to be
 
02:36:53.510 --> 02:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
needed for the next bium or we were have
 
02:36:56.190 --> 02:36:56.200 align:start position:0%
to look for alternative uh funding
 
02:36:58.590 --> 02:36:58.600 align:start position:0%
mechanisms right and what does what do
 
02:37:01.750 --> 02:37:01.760 align:start position:0%
lines 18 and 22 do is this where because
 
02:37:04.990 --> 02:37:05.000 align:start position:0%
because uh offline I had heard that we
 
02:37:09.710 --> 02:37:09.720 align:start position:0%
had narrowed eligibility to um adults we
 
02:37:12.510 --> 02:37:12.520 align:start position:0%
did that was with a prior Amendment uh
 
02:37:14.469 --> 02:37:14.479 align:start position:0%
that I brought forth that that carried
 
02:37:16.870 --> 02:37:16.880 align:start position:0%
over into here where where where is it
 
02:37:20.670 --> 02:37:20.680 align:start position:0%
and that is uh 18 line 18 through 22 is
 
02:37:23.469 --> 02:37:23.479 align:start position:0%
from a prior Amendment and that's make I
 
02:37:26.269 --> 02:37:26.279 align:start position:0%
I I I can't translate all of these
 
02:37:30.429 --> 02:37:30.439 align:start position:0%
various codes and rsas but is does that
 
02:37:33.510 --> 02:37:33.520 align:start position:0%
translate into adults only with the let
 
02:37:35.190 --> 02:37:35.200 align:start position:0%
let me let me just make sure I got the
 
02:37:35.200 --> 02:37:36.990 align:start position:0%
let me let me just make sure I got the
right

02:37:36.990 --> 02:37:37.000 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:37:39.510 --> 02:37:39.520 align:start position:0%
place the line it says have the
 
02:37:41.550 --> 02:37:41.560 align:start position:0%
individuals have graduated or exited the
 
02:37:43.030 --> 02:37:43.040 align:start position:0%
school system which means that they
 
02:37:45.150 --> 02:37:45.160 align:start position:0%
would not be having services from the
 
02:37:48.030 --> 02:37:48.040 align:start position:0%
schools and are adults if I understand
 
02:37:52.349 --> 02:37:52.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:55.910 --> 02:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
you you concur I do okay and that was
 
02:37:58.349 --> 02:37:58.359 align:start position:0%
that was in uh the last last version
 
02:38:01.269 --> 02:38:01.279 align:start position:0%
that we discussed but um we still felt
 
02:38:04.550 --> 02:38:04.560 align:start position:0%
that um there was a desire if we could
 
02:38:06.710 --> 02:38:06.720 align:start position:0%
do something to to have good information
 
02:38:09.870 --> 02:38:09.880 align:start position:0%
to act from when we when this committee
 
02:38:12.190 --> 02:38:12.200 align:start position:0%
or its successor meets that have
 
02:38:14.510 --> 02:38:14.520 align:start position:0%
information to work on and and then was
 
02:38:16.429 --> 02:38:16.439 align:start position:0%
it was it this bill Mr White or a
 
02:38:18.630 --> 02:38:18.640 align:start position:0%
different Bill where there was some
 
02:38:21.389 --> 02:38:21.399 align:start position:0%
concern that that the we may not have
 
02:38:23.870 --> 02:38:23.880 align:start position:0%
accumulated enough data given that it
 
02:38:25.830 --> 02:38:25.840 align:start position:0%
takes a while to establish the pro
 
02:38:28.670 --> 02:38:28.680 align:start position:0%
program to begin with and in one of
 
02:38:30.469 --> 02:38:30.479 align:start position:0%
these bills we needed to
 
02:38:30.479 --> 02:38:32.030 align:start position:0%
these bills we needed to
be

02:38:32.030 --> 02:38:32.040 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:38:35.710 --> 02:38:35.720 align:start position:0%
aware that uh our date for asking for a
 
02:38:38.150 --> 02:38:38.160 align:start position:0%
report may be a little early and I just
 
02:38:40.230 --> 02:38:40.240 align:start position:0%
want to know if it was this bill or
 
02:38:43.110 --> 02:38:43.120 align:start position:0%
something else yes so it was this bill
 
02:38:47.269 --> 02:38:47.279 align:start position:0%
and on page one line 30 of the amendment
 
02:38:50.349 --> 02:38:50.359 align:start position:0%
in front of you um the interim report is
 
02:38:53.469 --> 02:38:53.479 align:start position:0%
due April 1st of
 
02:38:55.630 --> 02:38:55.640 align:start position:0%
2025 and then there is looks like
 
02:38:57.710 --> 02:38:57.720 align:start position:0%
there's a secondary report for September
 
02:38:59.110 --> 02:38:59.120 align:start position:0%
30th of
 
02:39:03.429 --> 02:39:03.439 align:start position:0%
2025 um and as part of that I'm assuming
 
02:39:05.110 --> 02:39:05.120 align:start position:0%
that there would be funds available in
 
02:39:07.670 --> 02:39:07.680 align:start position:0%
state fiscal year 26 um there are
 
02:39:09.630 --> 02:39:09.640 align:start position:0%
there's not an appropriation here for
 
02:39:12.070 --> 02:39:12.080 align:start position:0%
State fiscal year 26 but we would still
 
02:39:15.030 --> 02:39:15.040 align:start position:0%
have that report to deliver so are those
 
02:39:17.630 --> 02:39:17.640 align:start position:0%
report dates do they pass your common
 
02:39:19.469 --> 02:39:19.479 align:start position:0%
sense test are we going to actually have
 
02:39:21.389 --> 02:39:21.399 align:start position:0%
have data accumulated that's worth
 
02:39:26.070 --> 02:39:26.080 align:start position:0%
reporting by one April the the provision
 
02:39:29.750 --> 02:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
on line 25 the department May utilize a
 
02:39:33.389 --> 02:39:33.399 align:start position:0%
soul Source procurement method um I
 
02:39:36.269 --> 02:39:36.279 align:start position:0%
think that would give us some grounds it
 
02:39:38.150 --> 02:39:38.160 align:start position:0%
it would still be a soul Source request
 
02:39:40.510 --> 02:39:40.520 align:start position:0%
to to GNC but that would allow us to
 
02:39:42.190 --> 02:39:42.200 align:start position:0%
move forward with the contract a little
 
02:39:44.990 --> 02:39:45.000 align:start position:0%
sooner um than we would otherwise so we
 
02:39:47.950 --> 02:39:47.960 align:start position:0%
could probably contract in 3 or 4 months
 
02:39:50.710 --> 02:39:50.720 align:start position:0%
depending on um how ult the negotiation
 
02:39:53.510 --> 02:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
process would be and then by April you
 
02:39:55.790 --> 02:39:55.800 align:start position:0%
could at least have four or five six
 
02:39:58.070 --> 02:39:58.080 align:start position:0%
months of data is it generally true that
 
02:40:00.910 --> 02:40:00.920 align:start position:0%
soulle Source costs the state
 
02:40:03.230 --> 02:40:03.240 align:start position:0%
less it depends who you
 
02:40:07.469 --> 02:40:07.479 align:start position:0%
ask okay I thought I'd ask you but uh i'
 
02:40:11.190 --> 02:40:11.200 align:start position:0%
I've I've seen scenarios all right okay
 
02:40:13.670 --> 02:40:13.680 align:start position:0%
so so thank you
 
02:40:17.670 --> 02:40:17.680 align:start position:0%
um I I would entertain a motion if we're
 
02:40:19.790 --> 02:40:19.800 align:start position:0%
sort of done just making sure we
 
02:40:21.510 --> 02:40:21.520 align:start position:0%
understand what this bill does and then
 
02:40:23.750 --> 02:40:23.760 align:start position:0%
we can debate whether or not we agree
 
02:40:26.230 --> 02:40:26.240 align:start position:0%
with it or not so is do you have an
 
02:40:29.469 --> 02:40:29.479 align:start position:0%
amendment or excuse me I have a motion
 
02:40:32.429 --> 02:40:32.439 align:start position:0%
to accept that's what I'm looking for
 
02:40:34.469 --> 02:40:34.479 align:start position:0%
you want to do what you want to a motion
 
02:40:36.110 --> 02:40:36.120 align:start position:0%
to accept the amendment all right is
 
02:40:40.070 --> 02:40:40.080 align:start position:0%
there a second I second okay is there a
 
02:40:47.269 --> 02:40:47.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:49.750 --> 02:40:49.760 align:start position:0%
motion all right uh
 
02:40:54.710 --> 02:40:54.720 align:start position:0%
um okay I I I was initially more
 
02:40:58.389 --> 02:40:58.399 align:start position:0%
reluctant but this amendment uh applying
 
02:41:02.510 --> 02:41:02.520 align:start position:0%
to uh adults uh has addressed my biggest
 
02:41:07.190 --> 02:41:07.200 align:start position:0%
concern so uh I I I can see voting for
 
02:41:12.950 --> 02:41:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:16.469 --> 02:41:16.479 align:start position:0%
discussion thank you Mr chair so I agree
 
02:41:18.830 --> 02:41:18.840 align:start position:0%
that this is important to do right
 
02:41:20.910 --> 02:41:20.920 align:start position:0%
Recreation is is a part of fulfilling
 
02:41:23.630 --> 02:41:23.640 align:start position:0%
someone's life I my concern here
 
02:41:26.429 --> 02:41:26.439 align:start position:0%
is we are also tasked with making sure
 
02:41:29.349 --> 02:41:29.359 align:start position:0%
we're protecting those citizens who fund
 
02:41:32.269 --> 02:41:32.279 align:start position:0%
all of this through General funds and at
 
02:41:33.830 --> 02:41:33.840 align:start position:0%
some point we're raising funds to cover
 
02:41:36.030 --> 02:41:36.040 align:start position:0%
this it's not real clear to me how much
 
02:41:37.309 --> 02:41:37.319 align:start position:0%
of this is going to be covered from
 
02:41:38.630 --> 02:41:38.640 align:start position:0%
federal funds how much of this is going
 
02:41:41.510 --> 02:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
to be covered from State funds um even
 
02:41:42.950 --> 02:41:42.960 align:start position:0%
if there is a match and they're picking
 
02:41:44.510 --> 02:41:44.520 align:start position:0%
up half or two-thirds meaning the
 
02:41:46.389 --> 02:41:46.399 align:start position:0%
federal government it's still coming out
 
02:41:48.590 --> 02:41:48.600 align:start position:0%
of the pockets of people who are still
 
02:41:49.670 --> 02:41:49.680 align:start position:0%
trying to make sure sure they can make
 
02:41:52.429 --> 02:41:52.439 align:start position:0%
their ends meet so um while the
 
02:41:54.469 --> 02:41:54.479 align:start position:0%
amendment's better and I I'm okay with
 
02:41:56.469 --> 02:41:56.479 align:start position:0%
the amendment um I not sure I can
 
02:41:59.550 --> 02:41:59.560 align:start position:0%
support either the amended bill as is or
 
02:42:03.030 --> 02:42:03.040 align:start position:0%
as filed okay so so after this amendment
 
02:42:06.269 --> 02:42:06.279 align:start position:0%
we'll vote on the under underlying bill
 
02:42:10.389 --> 02:42:10.399 align:start position:0%
um any representative wer well looking
 
02:42:12.349 --> 02:42:12.359 align:start position:0%
at the language on both the amendment
 
02:42:15.710 --> 02:42:15.720 align:start position:0%
and the original Bill Roman one talks
 
02:42:17.670 --> 02:42:17.680 align:start position:0%
about recreational activity and then it
 
02:42:19.630 --> 02:42:19.640 align:start position:0%
says however the department Health and
 
02:42:22.269 --> 02:42:22.279 align:start position:0%
Human Services received clarification
 
02:42:23.750 --> 02:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
from the centers for Medicare and
 
02:42:25.950 --> 02:42:25.960 align:start position:0%
Medicaid services that supports and
 
02:42:28.469 --> 02:42:28.479 align:start position:0%
services that are recreational in nature
 
02:42:30.990 --> 02:42:31.000 align:start position:0%
are not reimbursable Services Under the
 
02:42:35.349 --> 02:42:35.359 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Program so it's you know it's
 
02:42:38.990 --> 02:42:39.000 align:start position:0%
for training and that kind of thing but
 
02:42:41.630 --> 02:42:41.640 align:start position:0%
taking them out to the Ball Game yeah I
 
02:42:45.190 --> 02:42:45.200 align:start position:0%
think I think in in in a subject matter
 
02:42:47.269 --> 02:42:47.279 align:start position:0%
expert can uh correct this if I'm
 
02:42:50.349 --> 02:42:50.359 align:start position:0%
mistaken but I think what this um money
 
02:42:54.550 --> 02:42:54.560 align:start position:0%
is intended to do is uh we we knew that
 
02:42:58.990 --> 02:42:59.000 align:start position:0%
CMS restricted uh funding so that
 
02:43:01.230 --> 02:43:01.240 align:start position:0%
recreational Services were not
 
02:43:04.349 --> 02:43:04.359 align:start position:0%
reimbursable uh unless they had a a
 
02:43:07.110 --> 02:43:07.120 align:start position:0%
documented therapeutic benefit to them
 
02:43:10.590 --> 02:43:10.600 align:start position:0%
and and without one this bill is
 
02:43:14.309 --> 02:43:14.319 align:start position:0%
intending to uh allow additional
 
02:43:17.389 --> 02:43:17.399 align:start position:0%
recreational services to be reimbursed
 
02:43:20.710 --> 02:43:20.720 align:start position:0%
uh to by the state St without dipping
 
02:43:22.870 --> 02:43:22.880 align:start position:0%
into Federal money I think that's the
 
02:43:25.469 --> 02:43:25.479 align:start position:0%
carve out I'm not sure that that word
 
02:43:28.150 --> 02:43:28.160 align:start position:0%
however is is the best word to be using
 
02:43:31.389 --> 02:43:31.399 align:start position:0%
there that sort of oh just I it's just
 
02:43:35.269 --> 02:43:35.279 align:start position:0%
not clean but um but but I think that's
 
02:43:38.309 --> 02:43:38.319 align:start position:0%
what it does is is that correct that we
 
02:43:39.750 --> 02:43:39.760 align:start position:0%
we're trying to pay for the stuff that
 
02:43:43.230 --> 02:43:43.240 align:start position:0%
Medicaid doesn't pay for yeah yeah does
 
02:43:46.349 --> 02:43:46.359 align:start position:0%
that address your yes okay I want to
 
02:43:48.070 --> 02:43:48.080 align:start position:0%
make sure we knew that yeah I I just
 
02:43:49.429 --> 02:43:49.439 align:start position:0%
don't like the way I I think it could
 
02:43:53.550 --> 02:43:53.560 align:start position:0%
have been written better but it go
 
02:43:56.630 --> 02:43:56.640 align:start position:0%
ahead so can someone from the Department
 
02:43:58.630 --> 02:43:58.640 align:start position:0%
give an estimate on how much of this is
 
02:44:00.590 --> 02:44:00.600 align:start position:0%
going to be picked up by General funds
 
02:44:04.750 --> 02:44:04.760 align:start position:0%
then it would be 100% um in section one
 
02:44:09.510 --> 02:44:09.520 align:start position:0%
ROM to line beginning on line 15 the the
 
02:44:11.230 --> 02:44:11.240 align:start position:0%
language the governor is otherwise or is
 
02:44:13.230 --> 02:44:13.240 align:start position:0%
authorized to draw a warrant for set for
 
02:44:14.429 --> 02:44:14.439 align:start position:0%
said sums out of any money in the
 
02:44:17.230 --> 02:44:17.240 align:start position:0%
treasury not otherwise appropriated um
 
02:44:20.830 --> 02:44:20.840 align:start position:0%
suggests it's 100% uh General
 
02:44:23.230 --> 02:44:23.240 align:start position:0%
funds representative Stringham and then
 
02:44:26.110 --> 02:44:26.120 align:start position:0%
representative Leon uh I agree with that
 
02:44:28.750 --> 02:44:28.760 align:start position:0%
and that was the intent but I will also
 
02:44:31.150 --> 02:44:31.160 align:start position:0%
kind of reate reiterate back when we did
 
02:44:33.110 --> 02:44:33.120 align:start position:0%
the budget for the developmentally
 
02:44:36.469 --> 02:44:36.479 align:start position:0%
disabled uh the budgets uh as written
 
02:44:39.830 --> 02:44:39.840 align:start position:0%
included these Services uh for two years
 
02:44:41.230 --> 02:44:41.240 align:start position:0%
and we were going to pay half and the
 
02:44:43.349 --> 02:44:43.359 align:start position:0%
federal government is going to pay half
 
02:44:45.870 --> 02:44:45.880 align:start position:0%
as it is uh they're not receiving them
 
02:44:49.269 --> 02:44:49.279 align:start position:0%
for one year so overall we'll end up
 
02:44:51.830 --> 02:44:51.840 align:start position:0%
spending about the same amount of money
 
02:44:54.790 --> 02:44:54.800 align:start position:0%
out of General funds that we would have
 
02:44:56.590 --> 02:44:56.600 align:start position:0%
if this change in the
 
02:45:00.190 --> 02:45:00.200 align:start position:0%
program uh interpretation or rules
 
02:45:02.750 --> 02:45:02.760 align:start position:0%
hadn't been made so but we still need to
 
02:45:04.710 --> 02:45:04.720 align:start position:0%
appropriate it because it's in a
 
02:45:07.670 --> 02:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
different bucket of of the uh budget
 
02:45:10.070 --> 02:45:10.080 align:start position:0%
this year and
 
02:45:14.469 --> 02:45:14.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:17.469 --> 02:45:17.479 align:start position:0%
that um thank you and I'm relatively new
 
02:45:19.030 --> 02:45:19.040 align:start position:0%
to all of this with the developmental de
 
02:45:20.710 --> 02:45:20.720 align:start position:0%
abilities in that whole system but from
 
02:45:22.990 --> 02:45:23.000 align:start position:0%
my understanding trying to work into it
 
02:45:24.510 --> 02:45:24.520 align:start position:0%
is that New Hampshire had always had a
 
02:45:26.309 --> 02:45:26.319 align:start position:0%
pretty decent amount of leeway in order
 
02:45:28.309 --> 02:45:28.319 align:start position:0%
to best serve our people the best way we
 
02:45:31.110 --> 02:45:31.120 align:start position:0%
knew how um as it's been moving forward
 
02:45:33.150 --> 02:45:33.160 align:start position:0%
CMS has being become more and more
 
02:45:35.190 --> 02:45:35.200 align:start position:0%
prescriptive of what can happen and
 
02:45:36.630 --> 02:45:36.640 align:start position:0%
these Community Services these
 
02:45:38.950 --> 02:45:38.960 align:start position:0%
recreational services are a lot are some
 
02:45:40.269 --> 02:45:40.279 align:start position:0%
of the things that we try and make sure
 
02:45:42.630 --> 02:45:42.640 align:start position:0%
happen School AED people and just making
 
02:45:43.750 --> 02:45:43.760 align:start position:0%
sure that you can be a part of the
 
02:45:45.550 --> 02:45:45.560 align:start position:0%
community so that's why this has been an
 
02:45:47.269 --> 02:45:47.279 align:start position:0%
important thing to do because it's
 
02:45:48.630 --> 02:45:48.640 align:start position:0%
looking to the whole person we need to
 
02:45:50.750 --> 02:45:50.760 align:start position:0%
make sure that it's within reasonable
 
02:45:53.230 --> 02:45:53.240 align:start position:0%
limits and I think this does it but um
 
02:45:55.150 --> 02:45:55.160 align:start position:0%
we're basically reimagining how we
 
02:45:57.590 --> 02:45:57.600 align:start position:0%
provide um services to developmentally
 
02:46:00.630 --> 02:46:00.640 align:start position:0%
disabled people in New Hampshire and um
 
02:46:02.349 --> 02:46:02.359 align:start position:0%
I think that continuing this during such
 
02:46:04.590 --> 02:46:04.600 align:start position:0%
a time of change is particularly
 
02:46:06.030 --> 02:46:06.040 align:start position:0%
important because they've had so much
 
02:46:07.510 --> 02:46:07.520 align:start position:0%
ripped away from them in the last year
 
02:46:10.670 --> 02:46:10.680 align:start position:0%
or two at least certainty has been
 
02:46:11.950 --> 02:46:11.960 align:start position:0%
because they have a whole bunch of
 
02:46:13.070 --> 02:46:13.080 align:start position:0%
questions about what's going to be
 
02:46:15.150 --> 02:46:15.160 align:start position:0%
funded and how and that kind of stress
 
02:46:16.550 --> 02:46:16.560 align:start position:0%
wears on
 
02:46:19.870 --> 02:46:19.880 align:start position:0%
you represent wer microphone's on did
 
02:46:21.550 --> 02:46:21.560 align:start position:0%
you have something you wanted to say
 
02:46:25.070 --> 02:46:25.080 align:start position:0%
okay no um is there any other comment
 
02:46:26.790 --> 02:46:26.800 align:start position:0%
did did I already ask for a motion on
 
02:46:28.230 --> 02:46:28.240 align:start position:0%
this you already gave it did it get
 
02:46:30.110 --> 02:46:30.120 align:start position:0%
seconded it got
 
02:46:33.389 --> 02:46:33.399 align:start position:0%
seconded uh so are we done with the
 
02:46:36.510 --> 02:46:36.520 align:start position:0%
discussion between division three on
 
02:46:38.510 --> 02:46:38.520 align:start position:0%
whether or not we want to support this
 
02:46:41.190 --> 02:46:41.200 align:start position:0%
bill or not I think I think we're done
 
02:46:43.590 --> 02:46:43.600 align:start position:0%
so uh do you want to call the role on
 
02:46:46.870 --> 02:46:46.880 align:start position:0%
this uh sure this is on
 
02:46:50.110 --> 02:46:50.120 align:start position:0%

02:49:47.630 --> 02:49:47.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:47.640 --> 02:50:17.630 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:50:17.630 --> 02:50:17.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:17.640 --> 02:50:26.389 align:start position:0%
 
sh

02:50:26.389 --> 02:50:26.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:29.229 --> 02:50:29.239 align:start position:0%
all right we've talked about House Bill
 
02:50:33.870 --> 02:50:33.880 align:start position:0%
1598 a few times um there was a a new
 
02:50:36.389 --> 02:50:36.399 align:start position:0%
fiscal note that was done on this uh
 
02:50:38.930 --> 02:50:38.940 align:start position:0%
that was uh
 
02:50:38.940 --> 02:50:41.750 align:start position:0%
that was uh
[Music]

02:50:41.750 --> 02:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:50:44.670 --> 02:50:44.680 align:start position:0%
231 and as I look at my
 
02:50:47.469 --> 02:50:47.479 align:start position:0%
notes I don't I don't see the that
 
02:50:53.150 --> 02:50:53.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:57.150 --> 02:50:57.160 align:start position:0%
2311 does anyone have a copy of it uh or
 
02:50:59.830 --> 02:50:59.840 align:start position:0%
maybe could just tell me what the impact
 
02:51:03.830 --> 02:51:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:03.840 --> 02:51:08.269 align:start position:0%
 
be

02:51:08.269 --> 02:51:08.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:11.229 --> 02:51:11.239 align:start position:0%
sure oh I actually stapled it it just
 
02:51:13.950 --> 02:51:13.960 align:start position:0%
looked oh
 
02:51:17.510 --> 02:51:17.520 align:start position:0%
okay yeah it Revis
 
02:51:17.520 --> 02:51:20.070 align:start position:0%
okay yeah it Revis
3624

02:51:20.070 --> 02:51:20.080 align:start position:0%
3624
 
02:51:27.309 --> 02:51:27.319 align:start position:0%
okay um so this was uh basically a a a $
 
02:51:31.510 --> 02:51:31.520 align:start position:0%
2.87 million a year program um with a a
 
02:51:36.389 --> 02:51:36.399 align:start position:0%
lower amount in the initial year and um
 
02:51:39.190 --> 02:51:39.200 align:start position:0%
do do you do you want to talk to either
 
02:51:42.190 --> 02:51:42.200 align:start position:0%
go ahead discuss either the 1598 itself
 
02:51:44.910 --> 02:51:44.920 align:start position:0%
or your amendment to it you talk to the
 
02:51:47.510 --> 02:51:47.520 align:start position:0%
amendment all
 
02:51:47.520 --> 02:51:51.070 align:start position:0%
amendment all
right

02:51:51.070 --> 02:51:51.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:51.080 --> 02:51:52.510 align:start position:0%
 
me

02:51:52.510 --> 02:51:52.520 align:start position:0%
me
 
02:51:58.389 --> 02:51:58.399 align:start position:0%
okay so I think that um the amendment
 
02:52:03.670 --> 02:52:03.680 align:start position:0%
basically would um cause the uh fiscal
 
02:52:07.349 --> 02:52:07.359 align:start position:0%
note to to change drastically this this
 
02:52:11.590 --> 02:52:11.600 align:start position:0%
would be changed a lot um when I did in
 
02:52:16.469 --> 02:52:16.479 align:start position:0%
the amendment was um two things it
 
02:52:21.070 --> 02:52:21.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:25.309 --> 02:52:25.319 align:start position:0%
um bill of starting the program
 
02:52:29.229 --> 02:52:29.239 align:start position:0%
immediately and or within the next year
 
02:52:31.510 --> 02:52:31.520 align:start position:0%
what it did was it gave the depart it
 
02:52:34.510 --> 02:52:34.520 align:start position:0%
gives the department one position and
 
02:52:36.429 --> 02:52:36.439 align:start position:0%
this person this position would be a
 
02:52:39.469 --> 02:52:39.479 align:start position:0%
program specialist and they would be a
 
02:52:42.110 --> 02:52:42.120 align:start position:0%
specialist in Social Security and
 
02:52:45.790 --> 02:52:45.800 align:start position:0%
veterans benefits so as children came
 
02:52:45.800 --> 02:52:47.429 align:start position:0%
veterans benefits so as children came
into

02:52:47.429 --> 02:52:47.439 align:start position:0%
into
 
02:52:47.439 --> 02:52:49.110 align:start position:0%
into
placement

02:52:49.110 --> 02:52:49.120 align:start position:0%
placement
 
02:52:50.510 --> 02:52:50.520 align:start position:0%
residential and we're going into
 
02:52:52.790 --> 02:52:52.800 align:start position:0%
residential placement with the
 
02:52:55.429 --> 02:52:55.439 align:start position:0%
Department um there would be someone
 
02:52:59.070 --> 02:52:59.080 align:start position:0%
there that would be doing the work to um
 
02:53:01.710 --> 02:53:01.720 align:start position:0%
see if children are eligible for these
 
02:53:04.870 --> 02:53:04.880 align:start position:0%
benefits this was something that came up
 
02:53:08.030 --> 02:53:08.040 align:start position:0%
um numerous times during the discussions
 
02:53:12.830 --> 02:53:12.840 align:start position:0%
on this bill and the second part is in
 
02:53:16.150 --> 02:53:16.160 align:start position:0%
order to get ready for the
 
02:53:20.429 --> 02:53:20.439 align:start position:0%
implementation of um the program not
 
02:53:22.469 --> 02:53:22.479 align:start position:0%
really a program but the implementation
 
02:53:26.349 --> 02:53:26.359 align:start position:0%
of the bill um the department came to me
 
02:53:29.710 --> 02:53:29.720 align:start position:0%
and talked to me about getting having a
 
02:53:33.630 --> 02:53:33.640 align:start position:0%
consultant who would help them develop a
 
02:53:36.830 --> 02:53:36.840 align:start position:0%
report that would outline what they
 
02:53:39.150 --> 02:53:39.160 align:start position:0%
would need to do to implement to
 
02:53:41.670 --> 02:53:41.680 align:start position:0%
implement the program so that's um
 
02:53:44.389 --> 02:53:44.399 align:start position:0%
section four of the amendment it
 
02:53:47.910 --> 02:53:47.920 align:start position:0%
basically um replaces the bill this
 
02:53:50.790 --> 02:53:50.800 align:start position:0%
replaces is all of the bill so it would
 
02:53:53.349 --> 02:53:53.359 align:start position:0%
be one position to help them with the
 
02:53:55.590 --> 02:53:55.600 align:start position:0%
eligibility for children who come into
 
02:53:59.990 --> 02:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
the system and then um the consultant
 
02:54:04.229 --> 02:54:04.239 align:start position:0%
which would help them um develop a
 
02:54:07.670 --> 02:54:07.680 align:start position:0%
report and how this program would be
 
02:54:12.550 --> 02:54:12.560 align:start position:0%
implemented um and it then it also um
 
02:54:17.190 --> 02:54:17.200 align:start position:0%
would take effect on July 1 2025 the
 
02:54:20.429 --> 02:54:20.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:22.110 --> 02:54:22.120 align:start position:0%
the program would start in the next
 
02:54:22.120 --> 02:54:25.670 align:start position:0%
the program would start in the next
budget

02:54:25.670 --> 02:54:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:25.680 --> 02:54:28.309 align:start position:0%
 
year

02:54:28.309 --> 02:54:28.319 align:start position:0%
year
 
02:54:31.309 --> 02:54:31.319 align:start position:0%
question discussion on the
 
02:54:33.790 --> 02:54:33.800 align:start position:0%
amendment you you you you you may you
 
02:54:37.870 --> 02:54:37.880 align:start position:0%
made a uh a qualitative comment about
 
02:54:40.750 --> 02:54:40.760 align:start position:0%
that um based on this we're probably
 
02:54:43.229 --> 02:54:43.239 align:start position:0%
going to see a significantly lower
 
02:54:47.389 --> 02:54:47.399 align:start position:0%
fiscal note do you have a a a wag number
 
02:54:51.030 --> 02:54:51.040 align:start position:0%
a wild ask I get I think the fiscal note
 
02:54:53.510 --> 02:54:53.520 align:start position:0%
would be the two sections added together
 
02:54:57.110 --> 02:54:57.120 align:start position:0%
one the consultant I have in this
 
02:54:59.429 --> 02:54:59.439 align:start position:0%
amendment the consultant being
 
02:55:03.830 --> 02:55:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:06.429 --> 02:55:06.439 align:start position:0%
position I'm not sure how much the
 
02:55:10.269 --> 02:55:10.279 align:start position:0%
position is probably in the neighborhood
 
02:55:14.469 --> 02:55:14.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:17.389 --> 02:55:17.399 align:start position:0%
110,000 is what we need to cover a
 
02:55:20.190 --> 02:55:20.200 align:start position:0%
position so that would be I guess that
 
02:55:22.550 --> 02:55:22.560 align:start position:0%
would be the new fiscal
 
02:55:25.030 --> 02:55:25.040 align:start position:0%
note you're welcome to come up if you
 
02:55:25.040 --> 02:55:27.150 align:start position:0%
note you're welcome to come up if you
want

02:55:27.150 --> 02:55:27.160 align:start position:0%
want
 
02:55:29.990 --> 02:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
to and and we're not holding you to
 
02:55:32.469 --> 02:55:32.479 align:start position:0%
account for these we're just looking for
 
02:55:39.910 --> 02:55:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:42.790 --> 02:55:42.800 align:start position:0%
data I I I don't intend to finish the
 
02:55:45.269 --> 02:55:45.279 align:start position:0%
vote on this until Friday so this is
 
02:55:46.870 --> 02:55:46.880 align:start position:0%
we're we're really in a conversation
 
02:55:48.389 --> 02:55:48.399 align:start position:0%
mode because I think the amendment
 
02:55:54.550 --> 02:55:54.560 align:start position:0%
changes the terrain yeah um so in in
 
02:55:57.670 --> 02:55:57.680 align:start position:0%
just quickly glancing at this um so the
 
02:56:00.110 --> 02:56:00.120 align:start position:0%
$106,000 is appropriated in section
 
02:56:03.150 --> 02:56:03.160 align:start position:0%
three of the amendment for the position
 
02:56:05.550 --> 02:56:05.560 align:start position:0%
so in the first year in state fiscal
 
02:56:05.560 --> 02:56:06.630 align:start position:0%
so in the first year in state fiscal
year

02:56:06.630 --> 02:56:06.640 align:start position:0%
year
 
02:56:11.630 --> 02:56:11.640 align:start position:0%
25 your total cost would be 306,000
 
02:56:14.830 --> 02:56:14.840 align:start position:0%
um dollar $200,000 being for the
 
02:56:17.229 --> 02:56:17.239 align:start position:0%
consultant the remaining
 
02:56:21.550 --> 02:56:21.560 align:start position:0%
106 um being for the position um we
 
02:56:23.950 --> 02:56:23.960 align:start position:0%
because section one would still go into
 
02:56:25.990 --> 02:56:26.000 align:start position:0%
effect July 1 of
 
02:56:28.710 --> 02:56:28.720 align:start position:0%
2025 um we would still have an estimated
 
02:56:32.229 --> 02:56:32.239 align:start position:0%
roughly $2.1 million general fund impact
 
02:56:34.269 --> 02:56:34.279 align:start position:0%
um so our DCF budget would need an
 
02:56:36.309 --> 02:56:36.319 align:start position:0%
additional $2 million as we've already
 
02:56:38.710 --> 02:56:38.720 align:start position:0%
discussed based on the offset revenue
 
02:56:40.910 --> 02:56:40.920 align:start position:0%
and then um the estimates that we had
 
02:56:44.990 --> 02:56:45.000 align:start position:0%
previously provided were for
 
02:56:47.670 --> 02:56:47.680 align:start position:0%
um additional positions to take on the
 
02:56:50.269 --> 02:56:50.279 align:start position:0%
work of man managing um the new trust
 
02:56:52.950 --> 02:56:52.960 align:start position:0%
accounts that we currently do not in in
 
02:56:59.030 --> 02:56:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:59.040 --> 02:57:02.630 align:start position:0%
 
bill

02:57:02.630 --> 02:57:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:05.670 --> 02:57:05.680 align:start position:0%
questions you you know what would be
 
02:57:10.190 --> 02:57:10.200 align:start position:0%
helpful to me is is uh the simplest of
 
02:57:13.910 --> 02:57:13.920 align:start position:0%
all little Excel tables that that sort
 
02:57:17.150 --> 02:57:17.160 align:start position:0%
of organizes what you just said
 
02:57:17.160 --> 02:57:18.670 align:start position:0%
of organizes what you just said
um

02:57:18.670 --> 02:57:18.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:57:20.750 --> 02:57:20.760 align:start position:0%
just a tiny little Excel
 
02:57:24.830 --> 02:57:24.840 align:start position:0%
table um so what what I propose doing
 
02:57:27.990 --> 02:57:28.000 align:start position:0%
and I'm open for other opinions on this
 
02:57:31.510 --> 02:57:31.520 align:start position:0%
is i' I'd like us to
 
02:57:36.309 --> 02:57:36.319 align:start position:0%
um absorb the amendment and um and then
 
02:57:38.950 --> 02:57:38.960 align:start position:0%
come back on Friday and it should not
 
02:57:41.389 --> 02:57:41.399 align:start position:0%
take long to determine what we want to
 
02:57:43.590 --> 02:57:43.600 align:start position:0%
do as a group so I I'm comfortable
 
02:57:45.830 --> 02:57:45.840 align:start position:0%
postponing this and if you could just
 
02:57:49.670 --> 02:57:49.680 align:start position:0%
give us a new number just informal
 
02:57:52.269 --> 02:57:52.279 align:start position:0%
um you it's your Amendment do you want
 
02:57:53.389 --> 02:57:53.399 align:start position:0%
to do it
 
02:57:56.429 --> 02:57:56.439 align:start position:0%
differently okay that sounds fine to me
 
02:57:59.830 --> 02:57:59.840 align:start position:0%
okay um thank
 
02:58:04.190 --> 02:58:04.200 align:start position:0%
you all right um so we're postponing uh
 
02:58:07.910 --> 02:58:07.920 align:start position:0%
recessing I guess 1598 to finalize it on
 
02:58:11.469 --> 02:58:11.479 align:start position:0%
Friday um and then so that brings us
 
02:58:14.870 --> 02:58:14.880 align:start position:0%
to hb1
 
02:58:20.229 --> 02:58:20.239 align:start position:0%
1573 um so we have at least a couple of
 
02:58:23.150 --> 02:58:23.160 align:start position:0%
amendments um and to make it simple why
 
02:58:26.469 --> 02:58:26.479 align:start position:0%
don't we have chairman Pearson come
 
02:58:28.910 --> 02:58:28.920 align:start position:0%
forward um
 
02:58:33.110 --> 02:58:33.120 align:start position:0%
and um representative walner uh you have
 
02:58:34.389 --> 02:58:34.399 align:start position:0%
an amendment as
 
02:58:39.710 --> 02:58:39.720 align:start position:0%
well okay so and I think maybe um the
 
02:58:42.550 --> 02:58:42.560 align:start position:0%
child advocate or um someone from do you
 
02:58:44.590 --> 02:58:44.600 align:start position:0%
do you want Miss Sanchez to step forward
 
02:58:48.750 --> 02:58:48.760 align:start position:0%
or or I think the the deputy
 
02:58:51.790 --> 02:58:51.800 align:start position:0%
who worked on putting this all um this
 
02:58:54.389 --> 02:58:54.399 align:start position:0%
amendment together okay Miss Sanchez
 
02:58:56.790 --> 02:58:56.800 align:start position:0%
jump all whoever you want to have step
 
02:59:01.790 --> 02:59:01.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:05.990 --> 02:59:06.000 align:start position:0%
not uh yes representment on
 
02:59:09.190 --> 02:59:09.200 align:start position:0%
this there there is an official uh I'm
 
02:59:11.229 --> 02:59:11.239 align:start position:0%
I'm going to refer to it for the course
 
02:59:13.750 --> 02:59:13.760 align:start position:0%
of the day as the Pearson Amendment and
 
02:59:15.110 --> 02:59:15.120 align:start position:0%
the number you're looking at and the
 
02:59:17.469 --> 02:59:17.479 align:start position:0%
Pearson amendment is about to be handed
 
02:59:28.830 --> 02:59:28.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:31.190 --> 02:59:31.200 align:start position:0%
unofficial I could use I could use
 
02:59:34.469 --> 02:59:34.479 align:start position:0%
another to tell you the truth I gave my
 
02:59:37.750 --> 02:59:37.760 align:start position:0%
walner one away repres walner actually
 
02:59:40.670 --> 02:59:40.680 align:start position:0%
thank you if he'd gotten an autographed
 
02:59:44.990 --> 02:59:45.000 align:start position:0%
it would have been worth more yeah
 
02:59:56.309 --> 02:59:56.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:00.710 --> 03:00:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:06.190 --> 03:00:06.200 align:start position:0%
right okay so I have 1183 oh that's
 
03:00:10.550 --> 03:00:10.560 align:start position:0%
1598 I have 1180 and I have
 
03:00:13.229 --> 03:00:13.239 align:start position:0%
1184 are those the two amendments we're
 
03:00:16.950 --> 03:00:16.960 align:start position:0%
talking about I think
 
03:00:16.960 --> 03:00:23.229 align:start position:0%
talking about I think
so

03:00:23.229 --> 03:00:23.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:25.070 --> 03:00:25.080 align:start position:0%
so so Miss
 
03:00:27.110 --> 03:00:27.120 align:start position:0%
Morris would you just go ahead and
 
03:00:29.229 --> 03:00:29.239 align:start position:0%
preposition at the end of the table
 
03:00:31.190 --> 03:00:31.200 align:start position:0%
where you could grab that microphone we
 
03:00:33.349 --> 03:00:33.359 align:start position:0%
may need to come to
 
03:00:36.229 --> 03:00:36.239 align:start position:0%
you okay I think this is the most
 
03:00:38.990 --> 03:00:39.000 align:start position:0%
complicated bill that division 3 has
 
03:00:43.150 --> 03:00:43.160 align:start position:0%
taken on this year um and I I just to
 
03:00:46.229 --> 03:00:46.239 align:start position:0%
level set everyone the way I view it is
 
03:00:50.229 --> 03:00:50.239 align:start position:0%
uh it's a it's an important bill uh we
 
03:00:54.150 --> 03:00:54.160 align:start position:0%
had a very bad incident
 
03:00:58.070 --> 03:00:58.080 align:start position:0%
outplaced and um and the office of the
 
03:01:01.590 --> 03:01:01.600 align:start position:0%
child advocate led a great investigation
 
03:01:04.870 --> 03:01:04.880 align:start position:0%
and Report summarizing the problems it
 
03:01:07.309 --> 03:01:07.319 align:start position:0%
stimulated a lot of concern and a lot of
 
03:01:10.309 --> 03:01:10.319 align:start position:0%
action a bill was put together went
 
03:01:13.550 --> 03:01:13.560 align:start position:0%
through children and family law came to
 
03:01:16.269 --> 03:01:16.279 align:start position:0%
us in what off of the consent calendar
 
03:01:19.990 --> 03:01:20.000 align:start position:0%
did do I remember that right it came so
 
03:01:23.429 --> 03:01:23.439 align:start position:0%
I'd like to believe that yeah so so and
 
03:01:25.670 --> 03:01:25.680 align:start position:0%
when we first started here in
 
03:01:28.389 --> 03:01:28.399 align:start position:0%
1573 we heard that the committee looked
 
03:01:31.429 --> 03:01:31.439 align:start position:0%
at the policy loved the policy but
 
03:01:33.790 --> 03:01:33.800 align:start position:0%
didn't really look at the financial
 
03:01:37.190 --> 03:01:37.200 align:start position:0%
impact so that created a bunch of
 
03:01:41.870 --> 03:01:41.880 align:start position:0%
turmoil uh to try to take a look at what
 
03:01:45.550 --> 03:01:45.560 align:start position:0%
the policy committee uh had proposed and
 
03:01:48.429 --> 03:01:48.439 align:start position:0%
the house had passed and and to to
 
03:01:51.349 --> 03:01:51.359 align:start position:0%
reinvent it in a way re-engineer it in a
 
03:01:54.309 --> 03:01:54.319 align:start position:0%
way in which we still protected our kids
 
03:01:56.229 --> 03:01:56.239 align:start position:0%
we still gave ourselves the assurance
 
03:01:58.269 --> 03:01:58.279 align:start position:0%
that we were actually protecting our
 
03:02:01.870 --> 03:02:01.880 align:start position:0%
kids and but we did it in a way in which
 
03:02:03.670 --> 03:02:03.680 align:start position:0%
uh the workload requirements were a
 
03:02:06.349 --> 03:02:06.359 align:start position:0%
little bit different and as a result we
 
03:02:09.990 --> 03:02:10.000 align:start position:0%
were able to anticipate A reduced spend
 
03:02:13.670 --> 03:02:13.680 align:start position:0%
on this so tremendous work has taken
 
03:02:17.309 --> 03:02:17.319 align:start position:0%
place Miss moris of DHHS has done a
 
03:02:20.110 --> 03:02:20.120 align:start position:0%
great job of coordinating with chairman
 
03:02:23.349 --> 03:02:23.359 align:start position:0%
Pearson and OCA and with the Judiciary
 
03:02:26.070 --> 03:02:26.080 align:start position:0%
right right the Judiciary is here okay
 
03:02:28.750 --> 03:02:28.760 align:start position:0%
would you have a seat next to Miss
 
03:02:30.510 --> 03:02:30.520 align:start position:0%
Morris thank
 
03:02:35.710 --> 03:02:35.720 align:start position:0%
you okay and and so so the maturity of
 
03:02:37.550 --> 03:02:37.560 align:start position:0%
what we're looking at and I I I don't
 
03:02:39.910 --> 03:02:39.920 align:start position:0%
want to prejudge representative walner
 
03:02:41.309 --> 03:02:41.319 align:start position:0%
Amendment because I haven't had a chance
 
03:02:44.030 --> 03:02:44.040 align:start position:0%
to see it but the maturity I think of
 
03:02:46.830 --> 03:02:46.840 align:start position:0%
1573 as represented in representative
 
03:02:50.950 --> 03:02:50.960 align:start position:0%
Pearson's amendment is that they've done
 
03:02:53.990 --> 03:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
a great job at figuring out where the
 
03:02:58.349 --> 03:02:58.359 align:start position:0%
department and the OCA agreed to agree
 
03:03:00.990 --> 03:03:01.000 align:start position:0%
and they have a couple of points where
 
03:03:03.790 --> 03:03:03.800 align:start position:0%
they don't agree and that's really the
 
03:03:06.070 --> 03:03:06.080 align:start position:0%
driver behind the reason we're looking
 
03:03:08.190 --> 03:03:08.200 align:start position:0%
at two amendments I don't want to call
 
03:03:11.910 --> 03:03:11.920 align:start position:0%
one the DHHS Amendment the other one OCA
 
03:03:13.790 --> 03:03:13.800 align:start position:0%
that's a little oppositional but we have
 
03:03:15.870 --> 03:03:15.880 align:start position:0%
different points of view that's why we
 
03:03:18.630 --> 03:03:18.640 align:start position:0%
have different amendments the maturity
 
03:03:23.990 --> 03:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
part of the Pearson Amendment uh is uh I
 
03:03:26.710 --> 03:03:26.720 align:start position:0%
I I'm not comfortable that the judicial
 
03:03:30.469 --> 03:03:30.479 align:start position:0%
branch has really had an opportunity to
 
03:03:33.269 --> 03:03:33.279 align:start position:0%
to to get in integrated into this
 
03:03:36.429 --> 03:03:36.439 align:start position:0%
amendment and by integrated what I mean
 
03:03:40.269 --> 03:03:40.279 align:start position:0%
is the initial fiscal note came out with
 
03:03:45.030 --> 03:03:45.040 align:start position:0%
two judges and and seven clerks um which
 
03:03:47.950 --> 03:03:47.960 align:start position:0%
created a fairly significant financial
 
03:03:50.670 --> 03:03:50.680 align:start position:0%
impact and that's not our division but
 
03:03:53.950 --> 03:03:53.960 align:start position:0%
so I'm trying to represent division well
 
03:03:58.389 --> 03:03:58.399 align:start position:0%
here one well here and what I had asked
 
03:04:00.190 --> 03:04:00.200 align:start position:0%
you to do and I don't know if you've had
 
03:04:01.950 --> 03:04:01.960 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to really do this to
 
03:04:03.349 --> 03:04:03.359 align:start position:0%
where you're comfortable with it that's
 
03:04:07.269 --> 03:04:07.279 align:start position:0%
why I want you to be able to speak is
 
03:04:11.309 --> 03:04:11.319 align:start position:0%
um the the The Logical flow of events is
 
03:04:14.469 --> 03:04:14.479 align:start position:0%
that we write a law the law gets
 
03:04:17.150 --> 03:04:17.160 align:start position:0%
implemented it has uh workload and
 
03:04:17.160 --> 03:04:18.389 align:start position:0%
implemented it has uh workload and
Workforce

03:04:18.389 --> 03:04:18.399 align:start position:0%
Workforce
 
03:04:21.429 --> 03:04:21.439 align:start position:0%
implications that the work load and
 
03:04:23.750 --> 03:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
Workforce implication gets represented
 
03:04:26.030 --> 03:04:26.040 align:start position:0%
in our budgets and we pay for what we
 
03:04:28.790 --> 03:04:28.800 align:start position:0%
say we're going to do when we're writing
 
03:04:31.870 --> 03:04:31.880 align:start position:0%
the law we have an opportunity to work
 
03:04:35.190 --> 03:04:35.200 align:start position:0%
the other way if if we take a look at
 
03:04:38.389 --> 03:04:38.399 align:start position:0%
what we think we want to do and it has a
 
03:04:41.389 --> 03:04:41.399 align:start position:0%
significant Workforce or workload
 
03:04:43.870 --> 03:04:43.880 align:start position:0%
implication then we can work back
 
03:04:46.790 --> 03:04:46.800 align:start position:0%
towards amending or coming up with a
 
03:04:49.790 --> 03:04:49.800 align:start position:0%
different way to WR the law so that
 
03:04:51.750 --> 03:04:51.760 align:start position:0%
we're still accomplishing the objective
 
03:04:54.510 --> 03:04:54.520 align:start position:0%
with the lower overhead and and that was
 
03:04:56.309 --> 03:04:56.319 align:start position:0%
the challenge I put to the judicial
 
03:04:58.870 --> 03:04:58.880 align:start position:0%
branch we don't do judicial stuff so so
 
03:05:01.910 --> 03:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
I needed you all to take a look at the
 
03:05:03.550 --> 03:05:03.560 align:start position:0%
language and figure out if there's a way
 
03:05:05.950 --> 03:05:05.960 align:start position:0%
to accomplish the objective in a more
 
03:05:05.960 --> 03:05:07.229 align:start position:0%
to accomplish the objective in a more
efficient

03:05:07.229 --> 03:05:07.239 align:start position:0%
efficient
 
03:05:11.790 --> 03:05:11.800 align:start position:0%
way so just real short do do do you feel
 
03:05:14.710 --> 03:05:14.720 align:start position:0%
like you've had time and an opportunity
 
03:05:18.550 --> 03:05:18.560 align:start position:0%
to integrate the your branches opinion
 
03:05:21.429 --> 03:05:21.439 align:start position:0%
on the way the workforce or workload
 
03:05:25.790 --> 03:05:25.800 align:start position:0%
ought to be scoped by this law thank you
 
03:05:27.710 --> 03:05:27.720 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman uh my name is Erin krian I'm
 
03:05:29.229 --> 03:05:29.239 align:start position:0%
the general counsel for the judicial
 
03:05:32.830 --> 03:05:32.840 align:start position:0%
branch I believe I was able to see um if
 
03:05:35.710 --> 03:05:35.720 align:start position:0%
not a final a near final of both
 
03:05:38.790 --> 03:05:38.800 align:start position:0%
versions um I think that some of the
 
03:05:41.510 --> 03:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
intentions of the Pearson version were
 
03:05:43.190 --> 03:05:43.200 align:start position:0%
they were not written exactly as they
 
03:05:45.950 --> 03:05:45.960 align:start position:0%
were scripted to be correct yeah they
 
03:05:47.830 --> 03:05:47.840 align:start position:0%
didn't make it into the amendment but
 
03:05:49.710 --> 03:05:49.720 align:start position:0%
yeah but I I I was able to look at both
 
03:05:50.870 --> 03:05:50.880 align:start position:0%
Alternatives and part of the reason I
 
03:05:52.790 --> 03:05:52.800 align:start position:0%
look at both Alternatives is ultimately
 
03:05:54.830 --> 03:05:54.840 align:start position:0%
we're not a we're not a policy player in
 
03:05:56.269 --> 03:05:56.279 align:start position:0%
this discussion we're just rendering
 
03:05:58.950 --> 03:05:58.960 align:start position:0%
fiscal estimates for the different
 
03:06:01.070 --> 03:06:01.080 align:start position:0%
visions of how much increased Court
 
03:06:03.269 --> 03:06:03.279 align:start position:0%
oversight there will be in in different
 
03:06:05.950 --> 03:06:05.960 align:start position:0%
scenarios and the original estimate that
 
03:06:08.790 --> 03:06:08.800 align:start position:0%
we had which was about 1.6 million was
 
03:06:10.429 --> 03:06:10.439 align:start position:0%
based on uh
 
03:06:12.830 --> 03:06:12.840 align:start position:0%
having a large number of extra hearings
 
03:06:14.790 --> 03:06:14.800 align:start position:0%
a year which even with the draft that
 
03:06:18.030 --> 03:06:18.040 align:start position:0%
OCA has done uh which I understand have
 
03:06:19.389 --> 03:06:19.399 align:start position:0%
to be the one that is under the name of
 
03:06:21.710 --> 03:06:21.720 align:start position:0%
Representative walner um would already
 
03:06:23.550 --> 03:06:23.560 align:start position:0%
be haved so it would already be closer
 
03:06:27.229 --> 03:06:27.239 align:start position:0%
to 800,000 to implement that Vision um
 
03:06:29.510 --> 03:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
the one that I understand is is an
 
03:06:31.229 --> 03:06:31.239 align:start position:0%
alternative which may be more cost
 
03:06:32.790 --> 03:06:32.800 align:start position:0%
effective But ultimately the legislature
 
03:06:35.349 --> 03:06:35.359 align:start position:0%
has to judge whether the costs and
 
03:06:38.510 --> 03:06:38.520 align:start position:0%
benefits equalize in that scenario uh
 
03:06:40.229 --> 03:06:40.239 align:start position:0%
reduces the number of hearings even
 
03:06:42.349 --> 03:06:42.359 align:start position:0%
further so that our costs would fall
 
03:06:44.950 --> 03:06:44.960 align:start position:0%
under 400,000 closer to about
 
03:06:47.269 --> 03:06:47.279 align:start position:0%
350,000 uh so there there are reduced
 
03:06:50.190 --> 03:06:50.200 align:start position:0%
costs to both Alternatives um one is
 
03:06:52.190 --> 03:06:52.200 align:start position:0%
still a higher number of hearings one is
 
03:06:54.710 --> 03:06:54.720 align:start position:0%
lower and hearings are just something
 
03:06:56.830 --> 03:06:56.840 align:start position:0%
that does cost uh money to increase
 
03:06:59.229 --> 03:06:59.239 align:start position:0%
should should I do I hear you right that
 
03:07:02.030 --> 03:07:02.040 align:start position:0%
there may be a a third alternative that
 
03:07:05.309 --> 03:07:05.319 align:start position:0%
would have a more efficiency yet than
 
03:07:08.349 --> 03:07:08.359 align:start position:0%
either of these two I think it's not
 
03:07:09.790 --> 03:07:09.800 align:start position:0%
represented in the Pearson dra but it
 
03:07:13.670 --> 03:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
was intended to be um to to consolidate
 
03:07:15.229 --> 03:07:15.239 align:start position:0%
all the follow-on hearings of the
 
03:07:17.110 --> 03:07:17.120 align:start position:0%
original 30-day hearing into the
 
03:07:20.110 --> 03:07:20.120 align:start position:0%
existing ing 90day uh review hearings
 
03:07:22.190 --> 03:07:22.200 align:start position:0%
that already occur and if that were the
 
03:07:24.309 --> 03:07:24.319 align:start position:0%
case then our our costs come down
 
03:07:26.389 --> 03:07:26.399 align:start position:0%
significantly with the consolidation but
 
03:07:28.309 --> 03:07:28.319 align:start position:0%
I believe both drafts currently have a
 
03:07:31.229 --> 03:07:31.239 align:start position:0%
30-day hearing and a 60-day follow on
 
03:07:33.150 --> 03:07:33.160 align:start position:0%
okay I'm I just got to keep it really
 
03:07:35.070 --> 03:07:35.080 align:start position:0%
simple so I can
 
03:07:38.550 --> 03:07:38.560 align:start position:0%
track right now
 
03:07:42.349 --> 03:07:42.359 align:start position:0%
11484 basically gets close to what you
 
03:07:45.790 --> 03:07:45.800 align:start position:0%
think would be the most efficient method
 
03:07:48.309 --> 03:07:48.319 align:start position:0%
but the words that that you think we
 
03:07:51.190 --> 03:07:51.200 align:start position:0%
ought to have are not yet in this
 
03:07:54.070 --> 03:07:54.080 align:start position:0%
amendment so we have we don't have your
 
03:07:57.429 --> 03:07:57.439 align:start position:0%
words anywhere in any in either of these
 
03:07:59.870 --> 03:07:59.880 align:start position:0%
amendments I I was able to look at them
 
03:08:02.389 --> 03:08:02.399 align:start position:0%
both and and give feedback the costs are
 
03:08:04.469 --> 03:08:04.479 align:start position:0%
different based on the different policy
 
03:08:06.590 --> 03:08:06.600 align:start position:0%
intentions um but I think that the
 
03:08:08.229 --> 03:08:08.239 align:start position:0%
policy intention That was supposed to be
 
03:08:11.349 --> 03:08:11.359 align:start position:0%
in 1184 has not made it into the draft
 
03:08:15.429 --> 03:08:15.439 align:start position:0%
yet um but if it when it does uh it will
 
03:08:16.830 --> 03:08:16.840 align:start position:0%
it will be the cheapest of the three
 
03:08:18.630 --> 03:08:18.640 align:start position:0%
alternatives one that's about 1.6
 
03:08:21.910 --> 03:08:21.920 align:start position:0%
million one that's like cheap but cost
 
03:08:23.990 --> 03:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
effective yeah whether it's cost
 
03:08:26.030 --> 03:08:26.040 align:start position:0%
effective is is your your adjudication
 
03:08:27.469 --> 03:08:27.479 align:start position:0%
because there's obviously a cost in
 
03:08:29.469 --> 03:08:29.479 align:start position:0%
terms of the policy as well and and
 
03:08:30.830 --> 03:08:30.840 align:start position:0%
that's something that you're you're
 
03:08:32.830 --> 03:08:32.840 align:start position:0%
weighing but there's there's one Vision
 
03:08:34.630 --> 03:08:34.640 align:start position:0%
which is the original which is about 1.6
 
03:08:36.750 --> 03:08:36.760 align:start position:0%
million I think the walner amendment is
 
03:08:39.429 --> 03:08:39.439 align:start position:0%
about 800,000 and the uh Pearson
 
03:08:44.550 --> 03:08:44.560 align:start position:0%
amendment is under 350 or so okay so um
 
03:08:46.429 --> 03:08:46.439 align:start position:0%
sorry to steal your thunder but I just
 
03:08:49.110 --> 03:08:49.120 align:start position:0%
wanted to get the judicial because they
 
03:08:51.070 --> 03:08:51.080 align:start position:0%
they haven't had as many opportunities
 
03:08:53.510 --> 03:08:53.520 align:start position:0%
to talk about this and and and I that my
 
03:08:56.429 --> 03:08:56.439 align:start position:0%
perception was that that there there a
 
03:08:58.670 --> 03:08:58.680 align:start position:0%
there's still a little bit of lag
 
03:09:01.910 --> 03:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
between their observations and what's in
 
03:09:05.389 --> 03:09:05.399 align:start position:0%
a written Amendment opportunity so do
 
03:09:08.389 --> 03:09:08.399 align:start position:0%
you want to speak to us U Mr chair thank
 
03:09:11.030 --> 03:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman uh I feel like I'm in a
 
03:09:12.990 --> 03:09:13.000 align:start position:0%
College reunion here because we have
 
03:09:16.229 --> 03:09:16.239 align:start position:0%
worked a lot on this and in good faith
 
03:09:18.710 --> 03:09:18.720 align:start position:0%
from everybody
 
03:09:22.870 --> 03:09:22.880 align:start position:0%
um my experience here and we came into
 
03:09:24.229 --> 03:09:24.239 align:start position:0%
the house together we're both in our
 
03:09:27.150 --> 03:09:27.160 align:start position:0%
eighth year and the experiences of many
 
03:09:31.229 --> 03:09:31.239 align:start position:0%
of us is during the process of hearings
 
03:09:33.389 --> 03:09:33.399 align:start position:0%
and craftings and back and forth things
 
03:09:36.790 --> 03:09:36.800 align:start position:0%
and so on some departments and agencies
 
03:09:38.950 --> 03:09:38.960 align:start position:0%
already start doing it they don't wait
 
03:09:41.070 --> 03:09:41.080 align:start position:0%
for the law to be signed they see some
 
03:09:43.389 --> 03:09:43.399 align:start position:0%
good ideas they hear some wonderful
 
03:09:48.429 --> 03:09:48.439 align:start position:0%
thoughts and quite a bit of this bill is
 
03:09:49.990 --> 03:09:50.000 align:start position:0%
amended by either
 
03:09:52.830 --> 03:09:52.840 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh dhh tells me they're
 
03:09:55.030 --> 03:09:55.040 align:start position:0%
already starting to work on and that
 
03:09:58.070 --> 03:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
encourages me and it also takes the
 
03:10:01.870 --> 03:10:01.880 align:start position:0%
pressure off because um I think we have
 
03:10:04.309 --> 03:10:04.319 align:start position:0%
about a inch and a half stack of
 
03:10:07.510 --> 03:10:07.520 align:start position:0%
amendments on this single bill and I
 
03:10:08.990 --> 03:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
don't think we're done yet certain
 
03:10:10.309 --> 03:10:10.319 align:start position:0%
things we had hoped would be in
 
03:10:13.389 --> 03:10:13.399 align:start position:0%
amendments didn't get in there we hope
 
03:10:14.950 --> 03:10:14.960 align:start position:0%
they had I don't know who dropped the
 
03:10:16.670 --> 03:10:16.680 align:start position:0%
ball it's not important but they're not
 
03:10:16.680 --> 03:10:18.190 align:start position:0%
ball it's not important but they're not
there

03:10:18.190 --> 03:10:18.200 align:start position:0%
there
 
03:10:19.830 --> 03:10:19.840 align:start position:0%
since the
 
03:10:22.790 --> 03:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
department who will be implementing this
 
03:10:25.429 --> 03:10:25.439 align:start position:0%
is already doing a lot of this I might
 
03:10:28.429 --> 03:10:28.439 align:start position:0%
suggest the best way forward is interim
 
03:10:33.030 --> 03:10:33.040 align:start position:0%
study and for me interim study is not
 
03:10:35.590 --> 03:10:35.600 align:start position:0%
death With Dignity here yes sir could
 
03:10:37.030 --> 03:10:37.040 align:start position:0%
you hold on one second is there
 
03:10:38.469 --> 03:10:38.479 align:start position:0%
something going on that I need to know
 
03:10:40.030 --> 03:10:40.040 align:start position:0%
about I just want to clarify I just
 
03:10:41.870 --> 03:10:41.880 align:start position:0%
learned that so I believe the the
 
03:10:43.429 --> 03:10:43.439 align:start position:0%
language that's in the Pearson Amendment
 
03:10:45.229 --> 03:10:45.239 align:start position:0%
today was the language that was provided
 
03:10:47.670 --> 03:10:47.680 align:start position:0%
to OS Friday and new language may have
 
03:10:49.990 --> 03:10:50.000 align:start position:0%
come over the weekend which has not been
 
03:10:52.469 --> 03:10:52.479 align:start position:0%
drafted yet no I double checked my email
 
03:10:54.830 --> 03:10:54.840 align:start position:0%
um the language I sent them on Friday
 
03:10:57.309 --> 03:10:57.319 align:start position:0%
there were three parts that they missed
 
03:10:59.790 --> 03:10:59.800 align:start position:0%
three lines so I just may have been my
 
03:11:01.389 --> 03:11:01.399 align:start position:0%
fault for producing an amendment today
 
03:11:03.870 --> 03:11:03.880 align:start position:0%
that maybe wasn't the latest inred oh no
 
03:11:06.269 --> 03:11:06.279 align:start position:0%
this it's no it's nobody's fault we're
 
03:11:07.710 --> 03:11:07.720 align:start position:0%
we're building the plane while we're
 
03:11:09.950 --> 03:11:09.960 align:start position:0%
trying to fly it is the is the issue I'm
 
03:11:11.670 --> 03:11:11.680 align:start position:0%
sorry to to cut off there I just wanted
 
03:11:13.630 --> 03:11:13.640 align:start position:0%
to I think there is something still at
 
03:11:15.830 --> 03:11:15.840 align:start position:0%
ol I just wanted to make that clear
 
03:11:17.990 --> 03:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
that's my understanding and and I even
 
03:11:21.110 --> 03:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
think the stuff that's at OS may not
 
03:11:23.110 --> 03:11:23.120 align:start position:0%
actually fully incorporate what's in the
 
03:11:26.910 --> 03:11:26.920 align:start position:0%
judicial Branch's mind in terms of the
 
03:11:28.910 --> 03:11:28.920 align:start position:0%
the best way to the optimum way that's
 
03:11:30.830 --> 03:11:30.840 align:start position:0%
the good way to say cheap the optimum
 
03:11:35.110 --> 03:11:35.120 align:start position:0%
way to do this well I uh I I I suppose I
 
03:11:37.030 --> 03:11:37.040 align:start position:0%
I can never say enough that the balance
 
03:11:39.070 --> 03:11:39.080 align:start position:0%
of the cost and the policy that you want
 
03:11:40.750 --> 03:11:40.760 align:start position:0%
to come to is not one that we would take
 
03:11:44.670 --> 03:11:44.680 align:start position:0%
a position on um there is certainly a
 
03:11:47.469 --> 03:11:47.479 align:start position:0%
cost alternative but that is not the one
 
03:11:49.429 --> 03:11:49.439 align:start position:0%
that the legislature has to adopt it's
 
03:11:51.190 --> 03:11:51.200 align:start position:0%
ultimately your determination where to
 
03:11:52.990 --> 03:11:53.000 align:start position:0%
spend the dollars you were so good and
 
03:11:55.590 --> 03:11:55.600 align:start position:0%
I'm just teasing me a little bit but uh
 
03:11:57.750 --> 03:11:57.760 align:start position:0%
we think it they fund it you do it
 
03:12:00.150 --> 03:12:00.160 align:start position:0%
that's exactly right yeah so I you got
 
03:12:01.910 --> 03:12:01.920 align:start position:0%
interrupted do you remember where you're
 
03:12:07.269 --> 03:12:07.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:12.190 --> 03:12:12.200 align:start position:0%
okay because they're already starting to
 
03:12:14.510 --> 03:12:14.520 align:start position:0%
implement many of the good ideas that
 
03:12:17.269 --> 03:12:17.279 align:start position:0%
came out of this entire process I I
 
03:12:19.030 --> 03:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
believe that takes the pressure off
 
03:12:21.150 --> 03:12:21.160 align:start position:0%
because we have a stack of amendments
 
03:12:24.550 --> 03:12:24.560 align:start position:0%
that big and it's likely to get bigger
 
03:12:26.790 --> 03:12:26.800 align:start position:0%
with the deadline looming ever ever
 
03:12:29.910 --> 03:12:29.920 align:start position:0%
closer I might suggest interim study
 
03:12:32.950 --> 03:12:32.960 align:start position:0%
which for me is never death With Dignity
 
03:12:35.150 --> 03:12:35.160 align:start position:0%
it's let's take the pressure off let's
 
03:12:38.630 --> 03:12:38.640 align:start position:0%
spend some time more time with Judiciary
 
03:12:41.510 --> 03:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
more time and make some good
 
03:12:43.309 --> 03:12:43.319 align:start position:0%
recommendations while the good ones are
 
03:12:45.710 --> 03:12:45.720 align:start position:0%
already being implemented I might
 
03:12:49.429 --> 03:12:49.439 align:start position:0%
suggest so I I hear your suggestion and
 
03:12:52.550 --> 03:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
the the S the the distinction I found
 
03:12:55.070 --> 03:12:55.080 align:start position:0%
between real interim study and and just
 
03:12:58.510 --> 03:12:58.520 align:start position:0%
a death With Dignity is that there is a
 
03:13:01.150 --> 03:13:01.160 align:start position:0%
uh key legislator willing to own the
 
03:13:03.429 --> 03:13:03.439 align:start position:0%
interm study process I think we could
 
03:13:05.429 --> 03:13:05.439 align:start position:0%
find that person well who who do we
 
03:13:08.309 --> 03:13:08.319 align:start position:0%
think we might find you've already asked
 
03:13:11.750 --> 03:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
me so are you on record saying if there
 
03:13:13.630 --> 03:13:13.640 align:start position:0%
was an interim study you would continue
 
03:13:17.269 --> 03:13:17.279 align:start position:0%
to own this issue I would okay now now
 
03:13:19.710 --> 03:13:19.720 align:start position:0%
I'll come to you in just a second but so
 
03:13:23.710 --> 03:13:23.720 align:start position:0%
Miss Morris um a statement was made by
 
03:13:26.229 --> 03:13:26.239 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson that a lot of the
 
03:13:28.590 --> 03:13:28.600 align:start position:0%
good ideas that have come out of all the
 
03:13:31.389 --> 03:13:31.399 align:start position:0%
brainstorming and writing and discussion
 
03:13:34.590 --> 03:13:34.600 align:start position:0%
that the department is already working
 
03:13:38.150 --> 03:13:38.160 align:start position:0%
and has and got various amounts of this
 
03:13:41.630 --> 03:13:41.640 align:start position:0%
already uh in in progress or in place
 
03:13:43.070 --> 03:13:43.080 align:start position:0%
could would you like
 
03:13:47.110 --> 03:13:47.120 align:start position:0%
to make that more clear to us sure so
 
03:13:49.950 --> 03:13:49.960 align:start position:0%
our team the d uh sorry the team with
 
03:13:52.790 --> 03:13:52.800 align:start position:0%
DCF and bcbh the ones who do the monthly
 
03:13:54.750 --> 03:13:54.760 align:start position:0%
visits as well as do the certification
 
03:13:57.990 --> 03:13:58.000 align:start position:0%
visits annually they meet with the OCA
 
03:14:01.870 --> 03:14:01.880 align:start position:0%
monthly to discuss policies um any other
 
03:14:04.229 --> 03:14:04.239 align:start position:0%
items of note and so that way they can
 
03:14:06.110 --> 03:14:06.120 align:start position:0%
our team can can bring that back and
 
03:14:08.830 --> 03:14:08.840 align:start position:0%
tweak policies uh tweak procedures as
 
03:14:12.590 --> 03:14:12.600 align:start position:0%
necessary now the spirit of the the bill
 
03:14:14.990 --> 03:14:15.000 align:start position:0%
we definitely support uh but some of the
 
03:14:18.950 --> 03:14:18.960 align:start position:0%
items would require fiscal uh implic uh
 
03:14:20.710 --> 03:14:20.720 align:start position:0%
Appropriations in order to move forward
 
03:14:23.429 --> 03:14:23.439 align:start position:0%
some of the larger real ticket items
 
03:14:25.190 --> 03:14:25.200 align:start position:0%
including you know increased visits and
 
03:14:26.950 --> 03:14:26.960 align:start position:0%
things of that nature but otherwise
 
03:14:28.990 --> 03:14:29.000 align:start position:0%
there's nothing to stop us from moving
 
03:14:32.030 --> 03:14:32.040 align:start position:0%
forward with many of the policies that
 
03:14:35.830 --> 03:14:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:39.349 --> 03:14:39.359 align:start position:0%
here all right you're up thank you
 
03:14:39.359 --> 03:14:40.429 align:start position:0%
here all right you're up thank you
chairman

03:14:40.429 --> 03:14:40.439 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
03:14:44.190 --> 03:14:44.200 align:start position:0%
Edwards um this is the first the OCA has
 
03:14:46.550 --> 03:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
heard of this we are not in agreement
 
03:14:49.269 --> 03:14:49.279 align:start position:0%
with their term study we believe that um
 
03:14:51.269 --> 03:14:51.279 align:start position:0%
we've worked closely with representative
 
03:14:54.469 --> 03:14:54.479 align:start position:0%
Pearson with DHHS with the Judiciary we
 
03:14:57.150 --> 03:14:57.160 align:start position:0%
met with um the subcommittee last week
 
03:14:58.990 --> 03:14:59.000 align:start position:0%
yourself and uh representative walner
 
03:15:02.429 --> 03:15:02.439 align:start position:0%
representative P priest sorry excuse me
 
03:15:04.630 --> 03:15:04.640 align:start position:0%
um it had a very productive conversation
 
03:15:07.030 --> 03:15:07.040 align:start position:0%
I believe that representative walner
 
03:15:10.429 --> 03:15:10.439 align:start position:0%
Amendment 1180 which everyone has does
 
03:15:13.910 --> 03:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
strike that balance now I appreciate you
 
03:15:15.590 --> 03:15:15.600 align:start position:0%
not saying it's the OCA Amendment and
 
03:15:17.910 --> 03:15:17.920 align:start position:0%
the DHHS Amendment because to be frank
 
03:15:20.630 --> 03:15:20.640 align:start position:0%
they're about 97% the same we have been
 
03:15:22.910 --> 03:15:22.920 align:start position:0%
working on this since last November
 
03:15:25.910 --> 03:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
really since last August I believe that
 
03:15:30.750 --> 03:15:30.760 align:start position:0%
1180 is ready to pass now um you got
 
03:15:33.950 --> 03:15:33.960 align:start position:0%
this fun Excel spreadsheet I heard how
 
03:15:35.469 --> 03:15:35.479 align:start position:0%
much you like Excel spreadsheets
 
03:15:35.479 --> 03:15:36.630 align:start position:0%
much you like Excel spreadsheets
chairman

03:15:36.630 --> 03:15:36.640 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
03:15:40.510 --> 03:15:40.520 align:start position:0%
Edwards um as well as you got a document
 
03:15:44.110 --> 03:15:44.120 align:start position:0%
that says at the top OCA proposal
 
03:15:46.389 --> 03:15:46.399 align:start position:0%
31524 um I know this has been really
 
03:15:48.309 --> 03:15:48.319 align:start position:0%
confusing with all the replace all
 
03:15:51.110 --> 03:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
amendments so what we tried to do was
 
03:15:53.910 --> 03:15:53.920 align:start position:0%
this OCA proposal is comparing
 
03:15:56.110 --> 03:15:56.120 align:start position:0%
representative walner Amendment with
 
03:15:59.389 --> 03:15:59.399 align:start position:0%
what passed the house as hb1 1573 in
 
03:16:01.389 --> 03:16:01.399 align:start position:0%
February because when you do the replace
 
03:16:02.870 --> 03:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
all there's not the strikeouts in the
 
03:16:06.030 --> 03:16:06.040 align:start position:0%
italics so this document shows you what
 
03:16:07.670 --> 03:16:07.680 align:start position:0%
differences is from what you guys
 
03:16:09.590 --> 03:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
already passed policy-wise
 
03:16:13.070 --> 03:16:13.080 align:start position:0%
this document is to really capture those
 
03:16:15.269 --> 03:16:15.279 align:start position:0%
three buckets and where there remain
 
03:16:17.710 --> 03:16:17.720 align:start position:0%
differences between represent ative
 
03:16:19.990 --> 03:16:20.000 align:start position:0%
walner Amendment and representative
 
03:16:21.710 --> 03:16:21.720 align:start position:0%
Pearson's Amendment and as I said it's
 
03:16:24.269 --> 03:16:24.279 align:start position:0%
extremely small we have actually come to
 
03:16:26.590 --> 03:16:26.600 align:start position:0%
complete agreement around the DCF
 
03:16:30.309 --> 03:16:30.319 align:start position:0%
monthly worker visits 100% the
 
03:16:34.269 --> 03:16:34.279 align:start position:0%
same the judicial um section so there's
 
03:16:36.670 --> 03:16:36.680 align:start position:0%
a header here that says dcyf monthly
 
03:16:36.680 --> 03:16:37.830 align:start position:0%
a header here that says dcyf monthly
worker

03:16:37.830 --> 03:16:37.840 align:start position:0%
worker
 
03:16:40.870 --> 03:16:40.880 align:start position:0%
visits just comparing the the walner
 
03:16:42.830 --> 03:16:42.840 align:start position:0%
amendment and the Pearson Amendment we
 
03:16:44.790 --> 03:16:44.800 align:start position:0%
did also add a column for the fiscal
 
03:16:47.510 --> 03:16:47.520 align:start position:0%
impact which we talked about pretty in
 
03:16:49.309 --> 03:16:49.319 align:start position:0%
depth at the subcommittee meeting last
 
03:16:50.830 --> 03:16:50.840 align:start position:0%
week but I wanted to make sure the rest
 
03:16:54.429 --> 03:16:54.439 align:start position:0%
of you could see that the Amendments
 
03:16:57.269 --> 03:16:57.279 align:start position:0%
that were made between two weeks ago and
 
03:17:00.349 --> 03:17:00.359 align:start position:0%
today really have significant fiscal
 
03:17:03.429 --> 03:17:03.439 align:start position:0%
impact and I just heard Aon uh describe
 
03:17:07.070 --> 03:17:07.080 align:start position:0%
those for the judicial piece um so the
 
03:17:09.150 --> 03:17:09.160 align:start position:0%
judicial piece the court oversight piece
 
03:17:11.229 --> 03:17:11.239 align:start position:0%
the primary difference right now between
 
03:17:14.269 --> 03:17:14.279 align:start position:0%
the two amendments the office of child
 
03:17:17.030 --> 03:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
advocate would still like to see that
 
03:17:19.349 --> 03:17:19.359 align:start position:0%
middle range that Aon just described
 
03:17:21.990 --> 03:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
where they not your your Bargain
 
03:17:24.309 --> 03:17:24.319 align:start position:0%
Basement price of $350,000 but the
 
03:17:25.469 --> 03:17:25.479 align:start position:0%
middle price of
 
03:17:29.070 --> 03:17:29.080 align:start position:0%
$800,000 where um the policy goal of the
 
03:17:31.590 --> 03:17:31.600 align:start position:0%
bill as passed in February was really to
 
03:17:33.349 --> 03:17:33.359 align:start position:0%
get children out of residential
 
03:17:35.910 --> 03:17:35.920 align:start position:0%
placement as quickly as possible reduce
 
03:17:39.630 --> 03:17:39.640 align:start position:0%
the cost of placement um so by having
 
03:17:41.309 --> 03:17:41.319 align:start position:0%
just a single 60-day hearing and then
 
03:17:43.750 --> 03:17:43.760 align:start position:0%
going back to the routine hearings that
 
03:17:46.229 --> 03:17:46.239 align:start position:0%
doesn't really add that much additional
 
03:17:49.110 --> 03:17:49.120 align:start position:0%
judicial oversight um so that is really
 
03:17:51.389 --> 03:17:51.399 align:start position:0%
the only difference is you know the
 
03:17:54.349 --> 03:17:54.359 align:start position:0%
walner amendment says one 60-day hearing
 
03:17:56.309 --> 03:17:56.319 align:start position:0%
and then continue to have 60-day
 
03:17:59.150 --> 03:17:59.160 align:start position:0%
hearings whereas I'm not sure what it
 
03:18:00.750 --> 03:18:00.760 align:start position:0%
actually says but the goal was to just
 
03:18:04.790 --> 03:18:04.800 align:start position:0%
go right back the new wner Amendment
 
03:18:08.349 --> 03:18:08.359 align:start position:0%
Cuts those 30-day hearings down just one
 
03:18:10.950 --> 03:18:10.960 align:start position:0%
30-day hearing then to 60-day hearings
 
03:18:12.630 --> 03:18:12.640 align:start position:0%
which is where that significant cost
 
03:18:15.550 --> 03:18:15.560 align:start position:0%
savings happened so really the big
 
03:18:17.710 --> 03:18:17.720 align:start position:0%
difference between these two amendments
 
03:18:21.309 --> 03:18:21.319 align:start position:0%
is in the middle bcbh certification team
 
03:18:24.229 --> 03:18:24.239 align:start position:0%
section um the compromise already
 
03:18:26.750 --> 03:18:26.760 align:start position:0%
occurred going from quarterly visits
 
03:18:29.950 --> 03:18:29.960 align:start position:0%
which is what was in the b the original
 
03:18:31.790 --> 03:18:31.800 align:start position:0%
bill you all passed at the end of
 
03:18:34.349 --> 03:18:34.359 align:start position:0%
February reached a compromise going to
 
03:18:36.590 --> 03:18:36.600 align:start position:0%
twice a year visits with one being
 
03:18:38.750 --> 03:18:38.760 align:start position:0%
unannounced the language discussed at
 
03:18:40.990 --> 03:18:41.000 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee last week was still
 
03:18:43.070 --> 03:18:43.080 align:start position:0%
doing those annual recertification
 
03:18:44.830 --> 03:18:44.840 align:start position:0%
visits as it stands in administrative
 
03:18:46.510 --> 03:18:46.520 align:start position:0%
rule right now you're not going to keep
 
03:18:50.269 --> 03:18:50.279 align:start position:0%
a facility certified that you are not
 
03:18:54.070 --> 03:18:54.080 align:start position:0%
visiting the OCA ask was that okay so if
 
03:18:55.990 --> 03:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
you're doing an annual visit just doing
 
03:18:57.309 --> 03:18:57.319 align:start position:0%
your recertification thing that you
 
03:18:59.670 --> 03:18:59.680 align:start position:0%
always do right now under in you know
 
03:19:01.429 --> 03:19:01.439 align:start position:0%
administrative rule if you're about to
 
03:19:03.790 --> 03:19:03.800 align:start position:0%
send a kid there and you haven't been
 
03:19:06.550 --> 03:19:06.560 align:start position:0%
there in several months go take a quick
 
03:19:09.910 --> 03:19:09.920 align:start position:0%
visit before you send a kid there um we
 
03:19:11.389 --> 03:19:11.399 align:start position:0%
thought we were in agreement on that
 
03:19:13.830 --> 03:19:13.840 align:start position:0%
there was language around that and then
 
03:19:15.750 --> 03:19:15.760 align:start position:0%
this amendment that we did receive the
 
03:19:19.710 --> 03:19:19.720 align:start position:0%
language Sunday night on now says the
 
03:19:23.229 --> 03:19:23.239 align:start position:0%
the Pearson Amendment if there's not a
 
03:19:24.710 --> 03:19:24.720 align:start position:0%
kid there we're not even going to do the
 
03:19:26.389 --> 03:19:26.399 align:start position:0%
recertification visits we're not going
 
03:19:28.710 --> 03:19:28.720 align:start position:0%
to visit at all if there's no kid there
 
03:19:31.229 --> 03:19:31.239 align:start position:0%
we're going to conditionally certify
 
03:19:34.710 --> 03:19:34.720 align:start position:0%
which from the OC standpoint is frankly
 
03:19:36.670 --> 03:19:36.680 align:start position:0%
a liability issue you now have a roster
 
03:19:38.750 --> 03:19:38.760 align:start position:0%
of certified placements that you're not
 
03:19:40.750 --> 03:19:40.760 align:start position:0%
visiting at all and then you're
 
03:19:41.790 --> 03:19:41.800 align:start position:0%
essentially going to have to go back out
 
03:19:43.550 --> 03:19:43.560 align:start position:0%
and do a certification visit before a
 
03:19:45.229 --> 03:19:45.239 align:start position:0%
kid goes so we are in agreement before a
 
03:19:46.469 --> 03:19:46.479 align:start position:0%
child gets there you need to make sure
 
03:19:48.189 --> 03:19:48.199 align:start position:0%
that place is okay
 
03:19:51.670 --> 03:19:51.680 align:start position:0%
so I hope that by laying it out this way
 
03:19:54.309 --> 03:19:54.319 align:start position:0%
it makes a little bit more sense of what
 
03:19:56.670 --> 03:19:56.680 align:start position:0%
changes are being made from what you all
 
03:20:00.590 --> 03:20:00.600 align:start position:0%
passed in February as hb1 1573 and then
 
03:20:03.550 --> 03:20:03.560 align:start position:0%
this lays out really those just minor
 
03:20:03.560 --> 03:20:05.429 align:start position:0%
this lays out really those just minor
differences

03:20:05.429 --> 03:20:05.439 align:start position:0%
differences
 
03:20:07.710 --> 03:20:07.720 align:start position:0%
between representative Pearson's
 
03:20:09.830 --> 03:20:09.840 align:start position:0%
Amendment today and representative
 
03:20:13.030 --> 03:20:13.040 align:start position:0%
wahner's Amendment today but really I
 
03:20:15.429 --> 03:20:15.439 align:start position:0%
think the policy that you all passed at
 
03:20:17.229 --> 03:20:17.239 align:start position:0%
the end of February that would you know
 
03:20:18.910 --> 03:20:18.920 align:start position:0%
address the safety of children is an
 
03:20:20.990 --> 03:20:21.000 align:start position:0%
important one I think we're so close
 
03:20:25.349 --> 03:20:25.359 align:start position:0%
right now that interim study um is not
 
03:20:26.830 --> 03:20:26.840 align:start position:0%
necessary I think you have a really good
 
03:20:28.670 --> 03:20:28.680 align:start position:0%
amendment in front of you and I'm happy
 
03:20:32.110 --> 03:20:32.120 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions um other about
 
03:20:34.150 --> 03:20:34.160 align:start position:0%
where the fiscal impact was or the
 
03:20:34.160 --> 03:20:37.349 align:start position:0%
where the fiscal impact was or the
policy

03:20:37.349 --> 03:20:37.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:39.710 --> 03:20:39.720 align:start position:0%
stuff I think I have a couple questions
 
03:20:43.030 --> 03:20:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:46.309 --> 03:20:46.319 align:start position:0%
uh let's let's say for example you're I
 
03:20:48.870 --> 03:20:48.880 align:start position:0%
I think I heard you that you you you
 
03:20:50.910 --> 03:20:50.920 align:start position:0%
would like instead of having a
 
03:20:52.429 --> 03:20:52.439 align:start position:0%
conditional certification an
 
03:20:53.910 --> 03:20:53.920 align:start position:0%
organization and a conditional
 
03:20:56.510 --> 03:20:56.520 align:start position:0%
certification that you would either want
 
03:20:59.910 --> 03:20:59.920 align:start position:0%
to terminate their certification or go
 
03:21:01.670 --> 03:21:01.680 align:start position:0%
ahead and do the inspections to keep
 
03:21:04.550 --> 03:21:04.560 align:start position:0%
them fully certified well you don't like
 
03:21:07.150 --> 03:21:07.160 align:start position:0%
the conditional part that's current law
 
03:21:09.429 --> 03:21:09.439 align:start position:0%
now so under current administrative rule
 
03:21:11.150 --> 03:21:11.160 align:start position:0%
if a facility is to maintain its
 
03:21:13.550 --> 03:21:13.560 align:start position:0%
certification it must have an annual
 
03:21:17.150 --> 03:21:17.160 align:start position:0%
in-person visit from bcbh in order to
 
03:21:20.070 --> 03:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
remain certified so that's a new thing
 
03:21:22.229 --> 03:21:22.239 align:start position:0%
that DHHS is putting forward now that
 
03:21:24.349 --> 03:21:24.359 align:start position:0%
now they'd like to not even do those
 
03:21:26.710 --> 03:21:26.720 align:start position:0%
required annual visits and just have
 
03:21:29.630 --> 03:21:29.640 align:start position:0%
this conditional certification sort of
 
03:21:32.550 --> 03:21:32.560 align:start position:0%
on the books without going to see them
 
03:21:33.870 --> 03:21:33.880 align:start position:0%
or doing the certification but they
 
03:21:35.510 --> 03:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
don't have any kids in them when they're
 
03:21:38.469 --> 03:21:38.479 align:start position:0%
in a conditional status no New Hampshire
 
03:21:39.950 --> 03:21:39.960 align:start position:0%
they have children but no New Hampshire
 
03:21:42.070 --> 03:21:42.080 align:start position:0%
children correct okay but there would
 
03:21:44.150 --> 03:21:44.160 align:start position:0%
still be a place so one distinction
 
03:21:48.269 --> 03:21:48.279 align:start position:0%
there is we're talking about D CF placed
 
03:21:51.269 --> 03:21:51.279 align:start position:0%
children so Child Protection or Juvenile
 
03:21:53.870 --> 03:21:53.880 align:start position:0%
Justice yeah if a facility remains
 
03:21:56.670 --> 03:21:56.680 align:start position:0%
certified though that does mean that
 
03:22:00.510 --> 03:22:00.520 align:start position:0%
bcbh could be offering that placement to
 
03:22:02.790 --> 03:22:02.800 align:start position:0%
parents that are doing voluntary
 
03:22:05.150 --> 03:22:05.160 align:start position:0%
placement that the the kids still with
 
03:22:07.870 --> 03:22:07.880 align:start position:0%
the parents and so the parents are
 
03:22:10.750 --> 03:22:10.760 align:start position:0%
seeing a list of certified
 
03:22:13.950 --> 03:22:13.960 align:start position:0%
facilities that have that that title
 
03:22:16.229 --> 03:22:16.239 align:start position:0%
certification they're not State Place
 
03:22:17.590 --> 03:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
children children so the same rules
 
03:22:20.469 --> 03:22:20.479 align:start position:0%
don't apply as far as what we're doing
 
03:22:23.670 --> 03:22:23.680 align:start position:0%
here um as well as um schools also make
 
03:22:25.469 --> 03:22:25.479 align:start position:0%
placements in some of those facilities
 
03:22:28.469 --> 03:22:28.479 align:start position:0%
so it I think you're you're entering a
 
03:22:30.950 --> 03:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
potentially liable gray area where
 
03:22:33.590 --> 03:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
you're keeping facilities on the books
 
03:22:36.269 --> 03:22:36.279 align:start position:0%
as approved by the state of New
 
03:22:38.830 --> 03:22:38.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but without any of the
 
03:22:40.950 --> 03:22:40.960 align:start position:0%
paperwork or oversight or visits which
 
03:22:43.229 --> 03:22:43.239 align:start position:0%
just that's a new gray area we're
 
03:22:45.910 --> 03:22:45.920 align:start position:0%
creating here which I'm not sure why we
 
03:22:47.870 --> 03:22:47.880 align:start position:0%
would do that it would be a new category
 
03:22:50.070 --> 03:22:50.080 align:start position:0%
too though it would be neither not
 
03:22:53.389 --> 03:22:53.399 align:start position:0%
certified nor certified it would
 
03:22:55.830 --> 03:22:55.840 align:start position:0%
be new thing called conditional
 
03:22:57.469 --> 03:22:57.479 align:start position:0%
certification I have no idea how that
 
03:22:59.550 --> 03:22:59.560 align:start position:0%
would be reflected it's it's not in the
 
03:23:01.710 --> 03:23:01.720 align:start position:0%
current law okay so if they had the
 
03:23:04.830 --> 03:23:04.840 align:start position:0%
money available the law allowed them to
 
03:23:07.990 --> 03:23:08.000 align:start position:0%
do conditional certification but if they
 
03:23:11.070 --> 03:23:11.080 align:start position:0%
had the ability and the the resources to
 
03:23:14.870 --> 03:23:14.880 align:start position:0%
go and keep a certification current they
 
03:23:16.990 --> 03:23:17.000 align:start position:0%
can they could do that regardless of the
 
03:23:19.070 --> 03:23:19.080 align:start position:0%
law could they not they could they could
 
03:23:22.590 --> 03:23:22.600 align:start position:0%
choose as a policy matter to do that
 
03:23:27.150 --> 03:23:27.160 align:start position:0%
instead of a legal compliance
 
03:23:29.269 --> 03:23:29.279 align:start position:0%
choice I guess they could do anything
 
03:23:30.710 --> 03:23:30.720 align:start position:0%
they wanted I'm just not sure why you
 
03:23:33.189 --> 03:23:33.199 align:start position:0%
would put that into law because we
 
03:23:34.830 --> 03:23:34.840 align:start position:0%
talked about this in a work session
 
03:23:37.510 --> 03:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
where where I I'm I'm just concerned
 
03:23:41.510 --> 03:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
that we um don't present a litigation
 
03:23:44.429 --> 03:23:44.439 align:start position:0%
Target by establishing standards that we
 
03:23:47.550 --> 03:23:47.560 align:start position:0%
don't have confidence are going to uh
 
03:23:50.510 --> 03:23:50.520 align:start position:0%
have resources sustained uh not just
 
03:23:53.189 --> 03:23:53.199 align:start position:0%
this budget but the next budget the
 
03:23:55.309 --> 03:23:55.319 align:start position:0%
budget there I mean we're talking about
 
03:23:57.750 --> 03:23:57.760 align:start position:0%
forever if we put this in the law until
 
03:23:59.670 --> 03:23:59.680 align:start position:0%
it gets changed so I'd rather have a
 
03:24:03.469 --> 03:24:03.479 align:start position:0%
lower litigation risk because of the law
 
03:24:06.870 --> 03:24:06.880 align:start position:0%
and more policy implementation by the
 
03:24:09.349 --> 03:24:09.359 align:start position:0%
department that that that's that's my
 
03:24:11.030 --> 03:24:11.040 align:start position:0%
point of view I absolutely hear what
 
03:24:12.910 --> 03:24:12.920 align:start position:0%
you're saying the current administrative
 
03:24:16.469 --> 03:24:16.479 align:start position:0%
rules that the department follows now
 
03:24:18.429 --> 03:24:18.439 align:start position:0%
has those annual visits presumably
 
03:24:20.229 --> 03:24:20.239 align:start position:0%
they've budgeted and staffed for those
 
03:24:23.429 --> 03:24:23.439 align:start position:0%
annual visits the purpose of this
 
03:24:25.710 --> 03:24:25.720 align:start position:0%
legislation was to
 
03:24:28.870 --> 03:24:28.880 align:start position:0%
create a higher standard strong not even
 
03:24:31.229 --> 03:24:31.239 align:start position:0%
a higher standard but clearer standards
 
03:24:33.469 --> 03:24:33.479 align:start position:0%
so to then say remember those
 
03:24:34.910 --> 03:24:34.920 align:start position:0%
administrative rules we told you we were
 
03:24:37.030 --> 03:24:37.040 align:start position:0%
going to bulk up so we didn't need a
 
03:24:38.910 --> 03:24:38.920 align:start position:0%
statute now we'd rather actually make a
 
03:24:41.110 --> 03:24:41.120 align:start position:0%
statute that's even less protective than
 
03:24:44.710 --> 03:24:44.720 align:start position:0%
the current process just I it just
 
03:24:46.710 --> 03:24:46.720 align:start position:0%
doesn't make sense to us for from where
 
03:24:49.349 --> 03:24:49.359 align:start position:0%
we're coming from of what the purpose of
 
03:24:53.309 --> 03:24:53.319 align:start position:0%
this bill is okay representative walner
 
03:24:54.630 --> 03:24:54.640 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of talk about your
 
03:24:56.349 --> 03:24:56.359 align:start position:0%
Amendment do you want to say something
 
03:24:58.830 --> 03:24:58.840 align:start position:0%
about your Amendment you I'll come to
 
03:25:00.670 --> 03:25:00.680 align:start position:0%
you representative wer well I want to
 
03:25:01.990 --> 03:25:02.000 align:start position:0%
say that there's been certainly been a
 
03:25:04.950 --> 03:25:04.960 align:start position:0%
lot of work on it and I've got a quite a
 
03:25:08.870 --> 03:25:08.880 align:start position:0%
big stack of amendments um both from the
 
03:25:11.630 --> 03:25:11.640 align:start position:0%
department and from the office of child
 
03:25:14.790 --> 03:25:14.800 align:start position:0%
advocate I think we're really close and
 
03:25:17.670 --> 03:25:17.680 align:start position:0%
a lot of work has gone on to on this I
 
03:25:20.469 --> 03:25:20.479 align:start position:0%
know chairman Pierce's um committee I
 
03:25:24.790 --> 03:25:24.800 align:start position:0%
think you sent this to the floor
 
03:25:27.150 --> 03:25:27.160 align:start position:0%
unanimously and I think you know your
 
03:25:29.309 --> 03:25:29.319 align:start position:0%
committee worked on it this committee
 
03:25:31.510 --> 03:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
certainly put in a lot of time on it so
 
03:25:36.150 --> 03:25:36.160 align:start position:0%
I think interim study um is really not
 
03:25:38.389 --> 03:25:38.399 align:start position:0%
necessary this time I think we've done a
 
03:25:42.349 --> 03:25:42.359 align:start position:0%
lot of study and the two committees have
 
03:25:44.349 --> 03:25:44.359 align:start position:0%
really come close and the two the
 
03:25:47.150 --> 03:25:47.160 align:start position:0%
department and the and the Advocate have
 
03:25:51.030 --> 03:25:51.040 align:start position:0%
come really close um I think Lisa just
 
03:25:51.040 --> 03:25:52.189 align:start position:0%
come really close um I think Lisa just
said

03:25:52.189 --> 03:25:52.199 align:start position:0%
said
 
03:25:56.269 --> 03:25:56.279 align:start position:0%
97% that's pretty good I said 95 but
 
03:25:59.429 --> 03:25:59.439 align:start position:0%
I'll take yours it's pretty good so well
 
03:26:01.910 --> 03:26:01.920 align:start position:0%
we we share 98% of our DNA with
 
03:26:06.030 --> 03:26:06.040 align:start position:0%
chimpanzees though so well so I I would
 
03:26:08.550 --> 03:26:08.560 align:start position:0%
I would like to see us be able to get
 
03:26:10.510 --> 03:26:10.520 align:start position:0%
something ready to go to the full
 
03:26:13.110 --> 03:26:13.120 align:start position:0%
committee and then on to the floor um I
 
03:26:14.429 --> 03:26:14.439 align:start position:0%
think this
 
03:26:18.349 --> 03:26:18.359 align:start position:0%
is the report if you read the report I
 
03:26:21.950 --> 03:26:21.960 align:start position:0%
think you'll see how serious this issue
 
03:26:21.960 --> 03:26:23.950 align:start position:0%
think you'll see how serious this issue
is

03:26:23.950 --> 03:26:23.960 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:26:28.429 --> 03:26:28.439 align:start position:0%
and New Hampshire has already had some
 
03:26:31.429 --> 03:26:31.439 align:start position:0%
pretty terrible
 
03:26:35.590 --> 03:26:35.600 align:start position:0%
experiences around children in
 
03:26:41.229 --> 03:26:41.239 align:start position:0%
placement and I think that we need to be
 
03:26:44.269 --> 03:26:44.279 align:start position:0%
proactive will everything in this law
 
03:26:46.389 --> 03:26:46.399 align:start position:0%
this bill if it passes will everything
 
03:26:50.429 --> 03:26:50.439 align:start position:0%
be perfect probably not I've never saw
 
03:26:52.950 --> 03:26:52.960 align:start position:0%
I've never seen perfect yet but we have
 
03:26:54.630 --> 03:26:54.640 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to come back here in
 
03:26:56.590 --> 03:26:56.600 align:start position:0%
January after they've been working on
 
03:26:58.630 --> 03:26:58.640 align:start position:0%
this to put it in place we come back
 
03:27:02.349 --> 03:27:02.359 align:start position:0%
here in January to do those tweaks where
 
03:27:05.550 --> 03:27:05.560 align:start position:0%
it doesn't work bring in something that
 
03:27:07.630 --> 03:27:07.640 align:start position:0%
you know makes it work better but I do
 
03:27:11.630 --> 03:27:11.640 align:start position:0%
think that we need to move forward and
 
03:27:16.870 --> 03:27:16.880 align:start position:0%
um to delay this is not um probably not
 
03:27:19.990 --> 03:27:20.000 align:start position:0%
a benefit to the state Mr chairman wait
 
03:27:21.870 --> 03:27:21.880 align:start position:0%
and you considered the Pearson Amendment
 
03:27:24.309 --> 03:27:24.319 align:start position:0%
and you you find it inadequate which is
 
03:27:26.950 --> 03:27:26.960 align:start position:0%
why you submitted another amendment a
 
03:27:28.510 --> 03:27:28.520 align:start position:0%
different Amendment oh well I didn't
 
03:27:30.750 --> 03:27:30.760 align:start position:0%
really see the I had the Pearson
 
03:27:32.910 --> 03:27:32.920 align:start position:0%
amendment was still coming in my mailbox
 
03:27:34.550 --> 03:27:34.560 align:start position:0%
right up until Sunday night when I went
 
03:27:39.750 --> 03:27:39.760 align:start position:0%
to bed so um me too okay so in all the
 
03:27:43.269 --> 03:27:43.279 align:start position:0%
efforts we still haven't right gotten
 
03:27:46.389 --> 03:27:46.399 align:start position:0%
okay I understand you know um Lisa put
 
03:27:46.399 --> 03:27:47.510 align:start position:0%
okay I understand you know um Lisa put
together

03:27:47.510 --> 03:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
together
 
03:27:50.110 --> 03:27:50.120 align:start position:0%
this piece that really outlines where
 
03:27:52.030 --> 03:27:52.040 align:start position:0%
the differences are and I think that
 
03:27:54.269 --> 03:27:54.279 align:start position:0%
would be really helpful if we could sort
 
03:27:57.150 --> 03:27:57.160 align:start position:0%
of focus in on the differences because
 
03:28:00.550 --> 03:28:00.560 align:start position:0%
we're really right down to just a few
 
03:28:04.550 --> 03:28:04.560 align:start position:0%
places so so representative
 
03:28:07.510 --> 03:28:07.520 align:start position:0%
wer there's so much in this that's P
 
03:28:10.269 --> 03:28:10.279 align:start position:0%
policy that we're not equipped to do
 
03:28:12.670 --> 03:28:12.680 align:start position:0%
that we're just loaded with stuff coming
 
03:28:14.429 --> 03:28:14.439 align:start position:0%
up on a deadline you don't have a lot of
 
03:28:18.990 --> 03:28:19.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:22.469 --> 03:28:22.479 align:start position:0%
study um Mr chairman is did you intend
 
03:28:24.870 --> 03:28:24.880 align:start position:0%
that to be a formal motion looking for a
 
03:28:26.670 --> 03:28:26.680 align:start position:0%
second I
 
03:28:28.510 --> 03:28:28.520 align:start position:0%
did that's
 
03:28:30.910 --> 03:28:30.920 align:start position:0%
seconded uh is there a discussion on the
 
03:28:32.910 --> 03:28:32.920 align:start position:0%
motion before
 
03:28:35.189 --> 03:28:35.199 align:start position:0%
us go go
 
03:28:38.590 --> 03:28:38.600 align:start position:0%
ahead if you do not decide interim study
 
03:28:41.910 --> 03:28:41.920 align:start position:0%
I would very much suggest that since
 
03:28:44.550 --> 03:28:44.560 align:start position:0%
DHHS will be implementing
 
03:28:47.870 --> 03:28:47.880 align:start position:0%
this you take their Amendment because
 
03:28:49.229 --> 03:28:49.239 align:start position:0%
they'll be implementing
 
03:28:54.150 --> 03:28:54.160 align:start position:0%
it we appreciate DHHS appreciates right
 
03:28:57.110 --> 03:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
the work of many different ones right
 
03:29:01.349 --> 03:29:01.359 align:start position:0%
but this will be dhs's job right so so
 
03:29:04.510 --> 03:29:04.520 align:start position:0%
okay so thank you I to the discussion on
 
03:29:08.469 --> 03:29:08.479 align:start position:0%
interim study whatever we do in finance
 
03:29:11.030 --> 03:29:11.040 align:start position:0%
in the next couple of weeks is not the
 
03:29:14.269 --> 03:29:14.279 align:start position:0%
end of this there the the Senate is
 
03:29:17.950 --> 03:29:17.960 align:start position:0%
working on a a parallel bill I believe
 
03:29:20.630 --> 03:29:20.640 align:start position:0%
we're going to end up getting that bill
 
03:29:23.030 --> 03:29:23.040 align:start position:0%
probably back into division three in a
 
03:29:23.990 --> 03:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
couple of
 
03:29:28.229 --> 03:29:28.239 align:start position:0%
months um I I don't I don't see our
 
03:29:32.229 --> 03:29:32.239 align:start position:0%
disposing of this bill as interim study
 
03:29:36.510 --> 03:29:36.520 align:start position:0%
to be a a problem because I I suspect
 
03:29:41.189 --> 03:29:41.199 align:start position:0%
Miss Morris and miss krian and and OCA
 
03:29:43.349 --> 03:29:43.359 align:start position:0%
you you everyone's going to continue
 
03:29:46.269 --> 03:29:46.279 align:start position:0%
trying to F refine this so we've got got
 
03:29:50.389 --> 03:29:50.399 align:start position:0%
like one way to go and if we pass this
 
03:29:53.510 --> 03:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
this becomes the house position and if
 
03:29:55.469 --> 03:29:55.479 align:start position:0%
and and and then I think that would
 
03:29:59.269 --> 03:29:59.279 align:start position:0%
limit us in a u Committee of conference
 
03:30:03.229 --> 03:30:03.239 align:start position:0%
uh a bit I I I I would like to just re
 
03:30:06.189 --> 03:30:06.199 align:start position:0%
retain some freedom of movement on this
 
03:30:08.189 --> 03:30:08.199 align:start position:0%
knowing that we're going to we're not
 
03:30:09.309 --> 03:30:09.319 align:start position:0%
done with this we're going to get this
 
03:30:11.469 --> 03:30:11.479 align:start position:0%
in a couple of months that that's my
 
03:30:13.510 --> 03:30:13.520 align:start position:0%
point of view I'm I I'm I'm leaning
 
03:30:16.870 --> 03:30:16.880 align:start position:0%
towards interim study on this
 
03:30:18.870 --> 03:30:18.880 align:start position:0%
sir go go
 
03:30:24.870 --> 03:30:24.880 align:start position:0%
wait did that was you yeah so the Senate
 
03:30:28.429 --> 03:30:28.439 align:start position:0%
bill hb1 1573 has some pretty essential
 
03:30:31.910 --> 03:30:31.920 align:start position:0%
pieces that are not in any other bills
 
03:30:34.870 --> 03:30:34.880 align:start position:0%
particularly 1573 the one before us
 
03:30:38.189 --> 03:30:38.199 align:start position:0%
correct the the findings but the
 
03:30:40.670 --> 03:30:40.680 align:start position:0%
creation of that new
 
03:30:43.429 --> 03:30:43.439 align:start position:0%
certification team that entire section
 
03:30:46.950 --> 03:30:46.960 align:start position:0%
is nowhere else the only only sections
 
03:30:50.590 --> 03:30:50.600 align:start position:0%
that overlap with Senate Bill 417 which
 
03:30:52.750 --> 03:30:52.760 align:start position:0%
did just pass the Senate Judiciary
 
03:30:54.910 --> 03:30:54.920 align:start position:0%
Committee policy committee last week
 
03:30:57.550 --> 03:30:57.560 align:start position:0%
unanimously is the section about the
 
03:31:00.830 --> 03:31:00.840 align:start position:0%
dcyf workers which we are in complete
 
03:31:02.510 --> 03:31:02.520 align:start position:0%
agreement on they're identical between
 
03:31:04.910 --> 03:31:04.920 align:start position:0%
these two bills as well as the judicial
 
03:31:07.110 --> 03:31:07.120 align:start position:0%
oversight portion which frankly I would
 
03:31:10.030 --> 03:31:10.040 align:start position:0%
say at this point this
 
03:31:12.910 --> 03:31:12.920 align:start position:0%
version is better in either of these
 
03:31:15.630 --> 03:31:15.640 align:start position:0%
bills um because the Judiciary did weigh
 
03:31:18.229 --> 03:31:18.239 align:start position:0%
in about uh the motion practice piece of
 
03:31:20.750 --> 03:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
it which was very important so while
 
03:31:23.070 --> 03:31:23.080 align:start position:0%
those two pieces would certainly meet in
 
03:31:24.830 --> 03:31:24.840 align:start position:0%
the middle um
 
03:31:29.110 --> 03:31:29.120 align:start position:0%
the policy piece of this about
 
03:31:32.189 --> 03:31:32.199 align:start position:0%
reducing children being in institutional
 
03:31:33.550 --> 03:31:33.560 align:start position:0%
placements and languishing in those
 
03:31:37.189 --> 03:31:37.199 align:start position:0%
placements and the creation and
 
03:31:39.269 --> 03:31:39.279 align:start position:0%
increased oversight of that bcbh
 
03:31:40.590 --> 03:31:40.600 align:start position:0%
certification team including the
 
03:31:41.910 --> 03:31:41.920 align:start position:0%
Appropriations that would allow them to
 
03:31:44.030 --> 03:31:44.040 align:start position:0%
create that team because we can talk
 
03:31:45.309 --> 03:31:45.319 align:start position:0%
about it all we want but if those
 
03:31:46.469 --> 03:31:46.479 align:start position:0%
positions don't
 
03:31:48.950 --> 03:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
get created that nothing's going to be
 
03:31:50.030 --> 03:31:50.040 align:start position:0%
done to
 
03:31:52.429 --> 03:31:52.439 align:start position:0%
improve that
 
03:31:55.269 --> 03:31:55.279 align:start position:0%
process so I'm sorry I have to truncate
 
03:31:58.309 --> 03:31:58.319 align:start position:0%
a lot of this so I can store it the the
 
03:32:00.229 --> 03:32:00.239 align:start position:0%
what I think I heard you say in there
 
03:32:03.510 --> 03:32:03.520 align:start position:0%
that's really important to me is that um
 
03:32:07.309 --> 03:32:07.319 align:start position:0%
the uh the certification part of
 
03:32:11.269 --> 03:32:11.279 align:start position:0%
1573 is not in the Senate version and
 
03:32:14.469 --> 03:32:14.479 align:start position:0%
and if we wanted to be additive to the
 
03:32:16.950 --> 03:32:16.960 align:start position:0%
process I hate I hate to say it but that
 
03:32:18.790 --> 03:32:18.800 align:start position:0%
sounds like it could be a really simple
 
03:32:21.429 --> 03:32:21.439 align:start position:0%
smaller amendment that we could pass out
 
03:32:25.189 --> 03:32:25.199 align:start position:0%
of here uh instead of all of the moving
 
03:32:27.070 --> 03:32:27.080 align:start position:0%
parts we just narrow it down because I
 
03:32:28.870 --> 03:32:28.880 align:start position:0%
don't I don't see a lot of movement you
 
03:32:31.990 --> 03:32:32.000 align:start position:0%
guys aren't disputing the certification
 
03:32:34.309 --> 03:32:34.319 align:start position:0%
piece much other than whether or not
 
03:32:38.229 --> 03:32:38.239 align:start position:0%
they should have this gray area of um of
 
03:32:40.030 --> 03:32:40.040 align:start position:0%
partial certification or whatever the
 
03:32:42.189 --> 03:32:42.199 align:start position:0%
term was I mean to be honest that is the
 
03:32:44.150 --> 03:32:44.160 align:start position:0%
major point of contention here in this
 
03:32:47.510 --> 03:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
room today is how far back the
 
03:32:49.870 --> 03:32:49.880 align:start position:0%
department has scaled that certification
 
03:32:53.030 --> 03:32:53.040 align:start position:0%
team's responsibilities in this Sunday
 
03:32:55.389 --> 03:32:55.399 align:start position:0%
night Amendment okay so is there more
 
03:32:57.349 --> 03:32:57.359 align:start position:0%
discussion on the motion before the
 
03:32:59.990 --> 03:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
committee on interim study
 
03:33:02.710 --> 03:33:02.720 align:start position:0%
representative walner well I am opposed
 
03:33:04.389 --> 03:33:04.399 align:start position:0%
to the interim study I think I already
 
03:33:10.670 --> 03:33:10.680 align:start position:0%
said that but um we don't interim study
 
03:33:13.269 --> 03:33:13.279 align:start position:0%
amendments we would be interest studying
 
03:33:16.110 --> 03:33:16.120 align:start position:0%
the bill as it came so just so that
 
03:33:18.750 --> 03:33:18.760 align:start position:0%
there's no I thought there was
 
03:33:21.670 --> 03:33:21.680 align:start position:0%
some reference to interim studying one
 
03:33:23.630 --> 03:33:23.640 align:start position:0%
of one or the other of the Amendments
 
03:33:26.269 --> 03:33:26.279 align:start position:0%
but could include all of the Amendments
 
03:33:30.110 --> 03:33:30.120 align:start position:0%
um well this will all be available this
 
03:33:31.550 --> 03:33:31.560 align:start position:0%
will all be available it's part of the
 
03:33:33.950 --> 03:33:33.960 align:start position:0%
record whoever's doing the interim study
 
03:33:37.429 --> 03:33:37.439 align:start position:0%
can use whatever materials that are done
 
03:33:40.070 --> 03:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
already right I mean yeah so we're just
 
03:33:42.870 --> 03:33:42.880 align:start position:0%
interim studying
 
03:33:45.189 --> 03:33:45.199 align:start position:0%
1573 right so don't throw your files
 
03:33:47.309 --> 03:33:47.319 align:start position:0%
away that's what you're saying yeah
 
03:33:51.110 --> 03:33:51.120 align:start position:0%
don't throw the flow um I just I I
 
03:33:53.309 --> 03:33:53.319 align:start position:0%
really feel like we've done so much work
 
03:33:55.189 --> 03:33:55.199 align:start position:0%
and the children and family law
 
03:33:57.950 --> 03:33:57.960 align:start position:0%
committee has done enormous amount of
 
03:34:01.269 --> 03:34:01.279 align:start position:0%
work on this the um child advocate and
 
03:34:03.790 --> 03:34:03.800 align:start position:0%
the department have worked on it and
 
03:34:06.550 --> 03:34:06.560 align:start position:0%
we're so close it feels like we really
 
03:34:09.150 --> 03:34:09.160 align:start position:0%
it would really make sense for us to
 
03:34:12.790 --> 03:34:12.800 align:start position:0%
pass this we we're going to if the other
 
03:34:15.070 --> 03:34:15.080 align:start position:0%
bill from the Senate comes over it would
 
03:34:18.750 --> 03:34:18.760 align:start position:0%
be nice to have a house position and
 
03:34:21.309 --> 03:34:21.319 align:start position:0%
this would be our position as we
 
03:34:24.229 --> 03:34:24.239 align:start position:0%
negotiate with the Senate around this
 
03:34:27.349 --> 03:34:27.359 align:start position:0%
rep represent wer this is unprecedented
 
03:34:30.110 --> 03:34:30.120 align:start position:0%
to have so many moving Parts when it
 
03:34:32.790 --> 03:34:32.800 align:start position:0%
comes to us just to make a financial
 
03:34:35.790 --> 03:34:35.800 align:start position:0%
decision not looking at 16 different
 
03:34:38.590 --> 03:34:38.600 align:start position:0%
policy things that's not our purview
 
03:34:40.269 --> 03:34:40.279 align:start position:0%
we're looking here to look at the costs
 
03:34:41.710 --> 03:34:41.720 align:start position:0%
and the money and if there were two
 
03:34:43.429 --> 03:34:43.439 align:start position:0%
different Alternatives we'd look at one
 
03:34:46.550 --> 03:34:46.560 align:start position:0%
or the other but because this needs to
 
03:34:48.830 --> 03:34:48.840 align:start position:0%
have all the incorporation of the other
 
03:34:51.349 --> 03:34:51.359 align:start position:0%
committees if it's interim study they
 
03:34:53.550 --> 03:34:53.560 align:start position:0%
can be incorporated so that it's not a
 
03:34:56.110 --> 03:34:56.120 align:start position:0%
policy change looking like it came from
 
03:34:57.950 --> 03:34:57.960 align:start position:0%
the finance committee and we'd be
 
03:35:00.189 --> 03:35:00.199 align:start position:0%
criticized for that so that's why I'm
 
03:35:01.950 --> 03:35:01.960 align:start position:0%
saying interim study you need to get all
 
03:35:03.670 --> 03:35:03.680 align:start position:0%
these things included thank you
 
03:35:03.680 --> 03:35:05.110 align:start position:0%
these things included thank you
representative

03:35:05.110 --> 03:35:05.120 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:35:08.590 --> 03:35:08.600 align:start position:0%
priest thank you Mr uh chairman um what
 
03:35:11.630 --> 03:35:11.640 align:start position:0%
if we just delay the decision on this
 
03:35:14.229 --> 03:35:14.239 align:start position:0%
until Friday and that would give an
 
03:35:16.990 --> 03:35:17.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity for both sides to come
 
03:35:19.830 --> 03:35:19.840 align:start position:0%
together and see if we could come up
 
03:35:23.309 --> 03:35:23.319 align:start position:0%
with something that had the
 
03:35:27.550 --> 03:35:27.560 align:start position:0%
fiscal um analysis in there that we can
 
03:35:32.349 --> 03:35:32.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:35.670 --> 03:35:35.680 align:start position:0%
on I I can give you an answer to that my
 
03:35:37.189 --> 03:35:37.199 align:start position:0%
answer would you like to do that
 
03:35:39.830 --> 03:35:39.840 align:start position:0%
representative Weller I'd say if they
 
03:35:42.670 --> 03:35:42.680 align:start position:0%
can come to a conclusion by Friday
 
03:35:44.870 --> 03:35:44.880 align:start position:0%
presented before us at that meeting in
 
03:35:47.469 --> 03:35:47.479 align:start position:0%
no less than 25 we got so many bills on
 
03:35:49.510 --> 03:35:49.520 align:start position:0%
there I don't want to pick another hour
 
03:35:51.550 --> 03:35:51.560 align:start position:0%
talking about this stuff when we've got
 
03:35:54.590 --> 03:35:54.600 align:start position:0%
like 40 bills before us Friday is just
 
03:35:56.670 --> 03:35:56.680 align:start position:0%
us though Friday is another work session
 
03:35:58.349 --> 03:35:58.359 align:start position:0%
in division three it's not your full
 
03:36:01.229 --> 03:36:01.239 align:start position:0%
finance committee either way yeah it's
 
03:36:03.830 --> 03:36:03.840 align:start position:0%
you know if if they have something by
 
03:36:06.030 --> 03:36:06.040 align:start position:0%
Friday then we could overturn the
 
03:36:09.189 --> 03:36:09.199 align:start position:0%
interim study the the we could uh the
 
03:36:13.590 --> 03:36:13.600 align:start position:0%
the challenge I think at this point U is
 
03:36:17.110 --> 03:36:17.120 align:start position:0%
that we we we still don't have Clarity
 
03:36:20.990 --> 03:36:21.000 align:start position:0%
on exactly which one Amendment we should
 
03:36:23.750 --> 03:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
adopt it doesn't sound like the judicial
 
03:36:26.389 --> 03:36:26.399 align:start position:0%
language is in either Amendment to the
 
03:36:30.870 --> 03:36:30.880 align:start position:0%
extent that it could be uh this whatever
 
03:36:33.389 --> 03:36:33.399 align:start position:0%
the amendment would be would trigger
 
03:36:37.229 --> 03:36:37.239 align:start position:0%
some more math to give us some idea I I
 
03:36:39.670 --> 03:36:39.680 align:start position:0%
don't I don't I don't I I just am having
 
03:36:41.950 --> 03:36:41.960 align:start position:0%
a hard time perceiving in the next four
 
03:36:45.830 --> 03:36:45.840 align:start position:0%
days the the completion of a a a and
 
03:36:48.590 --> 03:36:48.600 align:start position:0%
agreed upon Amendment the incorporation
 
03:36:51.790 --> 03:36:51.800 align:start position:0%
of the judicial input and another round
 
03:36:54.110 --> 03:36:54.120 align:start position:0%
of fiscal analysis so that we know what
 
03:36:57.309 --> 03:36:57.319 align:start position:0%
we're voting on Friday but if if that
 
03:36:59.790 --> 03:36:59.800 align:start position:0%
Miracle could happen I I would bring it
 
03:37:03.309 --> 03:37:03.319 align:start position:0%
up again but but I I just don't believe
 
03:37:06.070 --> 03:37:06.080 align:start position:0%
it the walner amendment is correct and
 
03:37:10.830 --> 03:37:10.840 align:start position:0%
complete as drafted by OSS and I I
 
03:37:12.389 --> 03:37:12.399 align:start position:0%
believe Erin's
 
03:37:15.550 --> 03:37:15.560 align:start position:0%
$800,000 reflects the intent and the
 
03:37:17.670 --> 03:37:17.680 align:start position:0%
language of the walner
 
03:37:20.389 --> 03:37:20.399 align:start position:0%
amendment the way she said it right but
 
03:37:22.070 --> 03:37:22.080 align:start position:0%
there's a lower
 
03:37:24.710 --> 03:37:24.720 align:start position:0%
alternative and there are a few points
 
03:37:29.910 --> 03:37:29.920 align:start position:0%
that OCA has stood fast on the DHHS
 
03:37:32.150 --> 03:37:32.160 align:start position:0%
which will be implementing this doesn't
 
03:37:35.229 --> 03:37:35.239 align:start position:0%
like yeah so so we do we have a valid
 
03:37:38.189 --> 03:37:38.199 align:start position:0%
motion before us um inter study you have
 
03:37:40.389 --> 03:37:40.399 align:start position:0%
a question comment
 
03:37:43.710 --> 03:37:43.720 align:start position:0%
representative thank you um this is for
 
03:37:45.670 --> 03:37:45.680 align:start position:0%
chairman Wier it's my understanding at
 
03:37:47.990 --> 03:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
least on regular policy committees that
 
03:37:50.510 --> 03:37:50.520 align:start position:0%
any member having voted on the
 
03:37:51.990 --> 03:37:52.000 align:start position:0%
prevailing side or the non-prevailing
 
03:37:53.590 --> 03:37:53.600 align:start position:0%
side can make a motion for
 
03:37:55.550 --> 03:37:55.560 align:start position:0%
reconsideration as long as the bill is
 
03:37:58.429 --> 03:37:58.439 align:start position:0%
within the committee is that true for
 
03:38:01.389 --> 03:38:01.399 align:start position:0%
finance divisions as well
 
03:38:01.399 --> 03:38:03.309 align:start position:0%
finance divisions as well
yes

03:38:03.309 --> 03:38:03.319 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:38:06.150 --> 03:38:06.160 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't lock out anybody from
 
03:38:07.790 --> 03:38:07.800 align:start position:0%
bringing this up Friday if we take a
 
03:38:10.070 --> 03:38:10.080 align:start position:0%
vote today if they believe they've come
 
03:38:12.229 --> 03:38:12.239 align:start position:0%
with a new solution and all of this
 
03:38:13.950 --> 03:38:13.960 align:start position:0%
happens before we get to the executive
 
03:38:16.469 --> 03:38:16.479 align:start position:0%
session for the full committee
 
03:38:19.349 --> 03:38:19.359 align:start position:0%
yeah and all it is is a recommendation
 
03:38:21.790 --> 03:38:21.800 align:start position:0%
so it can come before the committee on
 
03:38:25.030 --> 03:38:25.040 align:start position:0%
whenever it it's completed and it's just
 
03:38:27.469 --> 03:38:27.479 align:start position:0%
a recommendation someone else can say I
 
03:38:28.910 --> 03:38:28.920 align:start position:0%
don't agree with the recommendation I
 
03:38:31.469 --> 03:38:31.479 align:start position:0%
have an alternative and it's always open
 
03:38:35.229 --> 03:38:35.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:38.710 --> 03:38:38.720 align:start position:0%
done I guess my comment is why would we
 
03:38:40.910 --> 03:38:40.920 align:start position:0%
even do an interum study now why it
 
03:38:44.590 --> 03:38:44.600 align:start position:0%
sounds like we're putting off the um
 
03:38:47.630 --> 03:38:47.640 align:start position:0%
decision until Friday to see if we can
 
03:38:47.640 --> 03:38:49.229 align:start position:0%
decision until Friday to see if we can
get

03:38:49.229 --> 03:38:49.239 align:start position:0%
get
 
03:38:51.830 --> 03:38:51.840 align:start position:0%
closer to put on pressure to make sure
 
03:38:54.510 --> 03:38:54.520 align:start position:0%
it's ready well I think the I think I
 
03:38:56.269 --> 03:38:56.279 align:start position:0%
think they realize there's the pressur
 
03:38:58.269 --> 03:38:58.279 align:start position:0%
is there I mean an interim study can
 
03:39:00.830 --> 03:39:00.840 align:start position:0%
come forth on Friday if that's if that's
 
03:39:04.189 --> 03:39:04.199 align:start position:0%
the decision if not
 
03:39:06.550 --> 03:39:06.560 align:start position:0%
um we would have an amendment that we
 
03:39:06.560 --> 03:39:11.510 align:start position:0%
um we would have an amendment that we
could

03:39:11.510 --> 03:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:15.429 --> 03:39:15.439 align:start position:0%
adopt okay I hear you I I I think we
 
03:39:18.150 --> 03:39:18.160 align:start position:0%
have a valid Motion in front of us is
 
03:39:20.710 --> 03:39:20.720 align:start position:0%
there any further
 
03:39:24.630 --> 03:39:24.640 align:start position:0%
discussion are you ready to take a
 
03:39:27.830 --> 03:39:27.840 align:start position:0%
role yes I am this is on the motion is
 
03:39:30.309 --> 03:39:30.319 align:start position:0%
interim study for house bill
 
03:39:32.990 --> 03:39:33.000 align:start position:0%
1573 and the voluminous documents that
 
03:39:36.550 --> 03:39:36.560 align:start position:0%
are available so don't throw them away
 
03:39:40.990 --> 03:39:41.000 align:start position:0%
um uh representative Leon yes
 
03:39:43.670 --> 03:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
representative Earth yes representative
 
03:39:47.389 --> 03:39:47.399 align:start position:0%
hle yes representative Wier yes
 
03:39:47.399 --> 03:39:49.070 align:start position:0%
hle yes representative Wier yes
Representative

03:39:49.070 --> 03:39:49.080 align:start position:0%
Representative
 
03:39:53.630 --> 03:39:53.640 align:start position:0%
walner no Representative tersi no uh
 
03:39:55.189 --> 03:39:55.199 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham votes no
 
03:39:59.229 --> 03:39:59.239 align:start position:0%
representative Priest No and chairman
 
03:40:02.550 --> 03:40:02.560 align:start position:0%
Edwards uh yes the vote being five to
 
03:40:08.630 --> 03:40:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:12.070 --> 03:40:12.080 align:start position:0%
passes so so like we said if a miracle
 
03:40:14.269 --> 03:40:14.279 align:start position:0%
occurs and we can come up with a
 
03:40:16.030 --> 03:40:16.040 align:start position:0%
relatively straight
 
03:40:18.790 --> 03:40:18.800 align:start position:0%
forward simple set of decisions on
 
03:40:22.229 --> 03:40:22.239 align:start position:0%
Friday I I'm open to reconsidering this
 
03:40:24.950 --> 03:40:24.960 align:start position:0%
but at this time it just seems to me to
 
03:40:28.670 --> 03:40:28.680 align:start position:0%
be just too much mush uh not cooked
 
03:40:31.030 --> 03:40:31.040 align:start position:0%
enough to make a a professional
 
03:40:33.269 --> 03:40:33.279 align:start position:0%
recommendation to the finance committee
 
03:40:36.030 --> 03:40:36.040 align:start position:0%
so Mr chairman uh yes may I just add one
 
03:40:38.349 --> 03:40:38.359 align:start position:0%
thing I still for what what was referred
 
03:40:39.550 --> 03:40:39.560 align:start position:0%
to a spreadsheet haven't seen any
 
03:40:41.150 --> 03:40:41.160 align:start position:0%
numbers other than judicial gave us an
 
03:40:42.710 --> 03:40:42.720 align:start position:0%
update so it' be nice if by Friday there
 
03:40:44.870 --> 03:40:44.880 align:start position:0%
was a number that substitutes for the
 
03:40:47.590 --> 03:40:47.600 align:start position:0%
what's it $6 million that's currently in
 
03:40:51.870 --> 03:40:51.880 align:start position:0%
there now right right so um when we talk
 
03:40:53.030 --> 03:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
about spreadsheets we talk about where
 
03:40:55.070 --> 03:40:55.080 align:start position:0%
the finance committee um it'd really be
 
03:40:58.110 --> 03:40:58.120 align:start position:0%
nice to see the right the numbers thank
 
03:41:01.110 --> 03:41:01.120 align:start position:0%
so that's a this is a little bit uh more
 
03:41:04.710 --> 03:41:04.720 align:start position:0%
difficult um because we need judicial
 
03:41:07.630 --> 03:41:07.640 align:start position:0%
numbers in there too judicial gave us
 
03:41:09.469 --> 03:41:09.479 align:start position:0%
the numbers they said was 800k 1 case
 
03:41:12.030 --> 03:41:12.040 align:start position:0%
and 35 other case that's fantastic but
 
03:41:13.550 --> 03:41:13.560 align:start position:0%
there are the smaller numbers of the of
 
03:41:14.710 --> 03:41:14.720 align:start position:0%
the bigger picture the bigger picture is
 
03:41:16.389 --> 03:41:16.399 align:start position:0%
like 6 million
 
03:41:17.590 --> 03:41:17.600 align:start position:0%
so it' be nice to know what the
 
03:41:18.990 --> 03:41:19.000 align:start position:0%
replacement number is there for all
 
03:41:21.590 --> 03:41:21.600 align:start position:0%
these changes right I'm obsessed with
 
03:41:23.950 --> 03:41:23.960 align:start position:0%
the judicial just because uh it's
 
03:41:26.790 --> 03:41:26.800 align:start position:0%
division one and I want to be
 
03:41:29.750 --> 03:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
parsimonious with their money well I I
 
03:41:31.070 --> 03:41:31.080 align:start position:0%
guess I'm trusting that at least they
 
03:41:32.630 --> 03:41:32.640 align:start position:0%
come up with
 
03:41:35.070 --> 03:41:35.080 align:start position:0%
numbers uh representative walner I just
 
03:41:36.950 --> 03:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
wanted to point out for representative
 
03:41:41.189 --> 03:41:41.199 align:start position:0%
or I think if you take the um this
 
03:41:43.990 --> 03:41:44.000 align:start position:0%
document there are some estimates there
 
03:41:46.110 --> 03:41:46.120 align:start position:0%
of fiscal impact can you just tell me
 
03:41:49.269 --> 03:41:49.279 align:start position:0%
where well in the third column I
 
03:41:51.830 --> 03:41:51.840 align:start position:0%
included what was in the original let me
 
03:41:53.830 --> 03:41:53.840 align:start position:0%
be clear what I'm looking for is it so
 
03:41:54.670 --> 03:41:54.680 align:start position:0%
here we
 
03:41:57.469 --> 03:41:57.479 align:start position:0%
go we go to the last page judicial gave
 
03:41:59.070 --> 03:41:59.080 align:start position:0%
us a bottom line number down here for
 
03:42:01.550 --> 03:42:01.560 align:start position:0%
both cases I'd like to see a bottom line
 
03:42:04.389 --> 03:42:04.399 align:start position:0%
number down there for both cases of the
 
03:42:06.269 --> 03:42:06.279 align:start position:0%
other aspects of this whole thing just
 
03:42:08.590 --> 03:42:08.600 align:start position:0%
as you would see in a fiscal note thanks
 
03:42:14.149 --> 03:42:14.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:14.159 --> 03:42:18.110 align:start position:0%
 
you

03:42:18.110 --> 03:42:18.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:22.630 --> 03:42:22.640 align:start position:0%
okay so I think that concludes hp1 1573
 
03:42:25.550 --> 03:42:25.560 align:start position:0%
for the day uh as far as the work
 
03:42:30.550 --> 03:42:30.560 align:start position:0%
session goes um uh I think I think we I
 
03:42:33.269 --> 03:42:33.279 align:start position:0%
think we did a lot and uh and we're not
 
03:42:36.550 --> 03:42:36.560 align:start position:0%
done but we've at least reduced the uh
 
03:42:38.429 --> 03:42:38.439 align:start position:0%
the amount of things we have to finalize
 
03:42:40.710 --> 03:42:40.720 align:start position:0%
on Friday because Friday is truly our
 
03:42:44.670 --> 03:42:44.680 align:start position:0%
drop dead date so um thank you very much
 
03:42:48.510 --> 03:42:48.520 align:start position:0%
uh you have any words of wisdom for us
 
03:42:50.750 --> 03:42:50.760 align:start position:0%
Mickey uh the only thing I can say is
 
03:42:52.750 --> 03:42:52.760 align:start position:0%
I've got the two amendments that we had
 
03:42:55.710 --> 03:42:55.720 align:start position:0%
talked about earlier today you adopted
 
03:42:57.229 --> 03:42:57.239 align:start position:0%
them without the number I do have those
 
03:42:59.469 --> 03:42:59.479 align:start position:0%
to oh that's great let I I don't want to
 
03:43:01.189 --> 03:43:01.199 align:start position:0%
re this I want to hand those out and
 
03:43:03.349 --> 03:43:03.359 align:start position:0%
make sure everyone sees them and and see
 
03:43:05.710 --> 03:43:05.720 align:start position:0%
if anyone changes their mind now that
 
03:43:10.349 --> 03:43:10.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:10.359 --> 03:43:12.670 align:start position:0%
 
them

03:43:12.670 --> 03:43:12.680 align:start position:0%
them
 
03:43:14.750 --> 03:43:14.760 align:start position:0%
