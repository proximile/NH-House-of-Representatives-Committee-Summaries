Senator Sharon Carson representing

00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:27.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:35.669 --> 00:17:35.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:38.400 align:start position:0%
a lot of good work on this bill and uh
 
00:17:39.870 --> 00:17:39.880 align:start position:0%
really appreciate where we are and I'm
 
00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:42.600 align:start position:0%
Jeff Bradley thank you uh Mr President
 
00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:45.960 align:start position:0%
um it has been a a a long slog for all
 
00:17:49.270 --> 00:17:49.280 align:start position:0%
of us um and last time we met um I I
 
00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:51.440 align:start position:0%
made a commitment that we would um look
 
00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:53.440 align:start position:0%
at this in depth and we would spend time
 
00:17:54.990 --> 00:17:55.000 align:start position:0%
doing it and I feel like we've upheld
 
00:17:57.710 --> 00:17:57.720 align:start position:0%
that and we put a lot of work into this
 
00:17:59.630 --> 00:17:59.640 align:start position:0%
and looking at the Chang the Senate made
 
00:18:02.110 --> 00:18:02.120 align:start position:0%
you did as well um and we've all taken
 
00:18:04.909 --> 00:18:04.919 align:start position:0%
this very seriously with that there's
 
00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:07.280 align:start position:0%
only a few things that we wanted to
 
00:18:09.070 --> 00:18:09.080 align:start position:0%
address to see that if we could come to
 
00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:13.080 align:start position:0%
a um an agreement on and I'll start the
 
00:18:16.750 --> 00:18:16.760 align:start position:0%
first one I believe it seems to be just
 
00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:18.880 align:start position:0%
a misunderstanding of
 
00:18:22.390 --> 00:18:22.400 align:start position:0%
money the 1.6 1.7 million that was going
 
00:18:24.510 --> 00:18:24.520 align:start position:0%
to be split between the house uh excuse
 
00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:27.240 align:start position:0%
me between the court and the uh law
 
00:18:28.510 --> 00:18:28.520 align:start position:0%
enforcement with regard to the bail
 
00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:31.320 align:start position:0%
track tracking system that was removed
 
00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:33.280 align:start position:0%
but my understanding is that it's going
 
00:18:35.149 --> 00:18:35.159 align:start position:0%
to be it was possibly going to be funded
 
00:18:37.909 --> 00:18:37.919 align:start position:0%
to Opera um or some maybe you could
 
00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:41.200 align:start position:0%
speak to that yeah that was my hope and
 
00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:44.840 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if it's on the fiscal
 
00:18:47.789 --> 00:18:47.799 align:start position:0%
committee agenda for June um I thought
 
00:18:50.350 --> 00:18:50.360 align:start position:0%
that everybody was okay with that but I
 
00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:52.240 align:start position:0%
guess I would recommend since it's
 
00:18:54.430 --> 00:18:54.440 align:start position:0%
pretty important to the bill that we
 
00:18:57.310 --> 00:18:57.320 align:start position:0%
keep it in for now okay I was going to
 
00:18:59.070 --> 00:18:59.080 align:start position:0%
suggest some type of contingency
 
00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:01.280 align:start position:0%
language yeah exactly exactly all right
 
00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:02.960 align:start position:0%
so let's if we agree on the amount we
 
00:19:04.909 --> 00:19:04.919 align:start position:0%
agree on its importance it's going to be
 
00:19:06.390 --> 00:19:06.400 align:start position:0%
in there before we sign one way or the
 
00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:08.200 align:start position:0%
other so so I had hoped it would be in
 
00:19:12.669 --> 00:19:12.679 align:start position:0%
May but um just chairman Roy so you know
 
00:19:16.029 --> 00:19:16.039 align:start position:0%
the process yeah most of the arpa money
 
00:19:19.549 --> 00:19:19.559 align:start position:0%
has been allocated so there is some
 
00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:21.640 align:start position:0%
monies that have been allocated but not
 
00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:23.440 align:start position:0%
spent that are being returned that could
 
00:19:26.710 --> 00:19:26.720 align:start position:0%
be used for worthwhile purposes and this
 
00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:29.080 align:start position:0%
was a worthwhile purpose so I
 
00:19:31.710 --> 00:19:31.720 align:start position:0%
highlighted it um but there wasn't
 
00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
enough um room to do it in May okay so
 
00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:36.880 align:start position:0%
we're going to just like I said if we
 
00:19:38.909 --> 00:19:38.919 align:start position:0%
put contingency language if the money
 
00:19:40.990 --> 00:19:41.000 align:start position:0%
from arer doesn't appear we'll fund it
 
00:19:43.630 --> 00:19:43.640 align:start position:0%
um through the general fund we agree
 
00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:46.480 align:start position:0%
excellent thank you um let me see um
 
00:19:48.190 --> 00:19:48.200 align:start position:0%
there was one other issue I wanted to
 
00:19:51.070 --> 00:19:51.080 align:start position:0%
mention before I give it to my colleague
 
00:19:54.430 --> 00:19:54.440 align:start position:0%
um and if you just bear with me one
 
00:20:03.310 --> 00:20:03.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:06.480 align:start position:0%
okay so um there was a change in the in
 
00:20:10.789 --> 00:20:10.799 align:start position:0%
the standard um to hold someone um we
 
00:20:13.029 --> 00:20:13.039 align:start position:0%
had clear and convincing evidence as a
 
00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:15.520 align:start position:0%
standard to hold someone
 
00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:20.760 align:start position:0%
um for either danger or Flight Risk um
 
00:20:22.590 --> 00:20:22.600 align:start position:0%
the Senate moved it to preponderance of
 
00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
the evidence um there's an arguments out
 
00:20:28.029 --> 00:20:28.039 align:start position:0%
there that regarding Constitution from
 
00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:30.240 align:start position:0%
the Solano case I don't particularly buy
 
00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:32.440 align:start position:0%
into that having said that though I
 
00:20:36.149 --> 00:20:36.159 align:start position:0%
think that holding someone um their
 
00:20:37.669 --> 00:20:37.679 align:start position:0%
Liberty there should be a little bit of
 
00:20:39.149 --> 00:20:39.159 align:start position:0%
a higher standard so what I was going to
 
00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
propose to the Senate is how about if we
 
00:20:44.350 --> 00:20:44.360 align:start position:0%
split it and say preponderance of the
 
00:20:47.149 --> 00:20:47.159 align:start position:0%
evidence for someone who is a Flight
 
00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:49.440 align:start position:0%
Risk and the clearing convincing
 
00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
standard still if it's holding someone
 
00:20:54.990 --> 00:20:55.000 align:start position:0%
for danger um and I was wondering what
 
00:20:56.110 --> 00:20:56.120 align:start position:0%
you thought about
 
00:20:59.950 --> 00:20:59.960 align:start position:0%
that okay does that sound
 
00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:01.760 align:start position:0%
so we both get something there if
 
00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
someone is um dangerous enough they need
 
00:21:05.870 --> 00:21:05.880 align:start position:0%
to be held the evidence is going to be
 
00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:07.520 align:start position:0%
just a little bit higher that they are
 
00:21:10.590 --> 00:21:10.600 align:start position:0%
dangerous all right um with that I would
 
00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:12.720 align:start position:0%
um int or not introduce but hand it over
 
00:21:14.789 --> 00:21:14.799 align:start position:0%
to uh representative rhods she had a
 
00:21:17.230 --> 00:21:17.240 align:start position:0%
particular issue she wanted to address
 
00:21:18.990 --> 00:21:19.000 align:start position:0%
thank you excuse me thank you Mr
 
00:21:21.390 --> 00:21:21.400 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you um all of our
 
00:21:23.230 --> 00:21:23.240 align:start position:0%
esteemed colleagues for being here today
 
00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:25.200 align:start position:0%
the the one thing that I very much would
 
00:21:27.549 --> 00:21:27.559 align:start position:0%
like to address is the fact that we
 
00:21:29.789 --> 00:21:29.799 align:start position:0%
clearly agree on far more than we
 
00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:32.720 align:start position:0%
disagree on and um on this particular
 
00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:34.720 align:start position:0%
issue I'm curious if it if it even was
 
00:21:36.110 --> 00:21:36.120 align:start position:0%
intentional it could have been also an
 
00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:39.240 align:start position:0%
oversight but if you look at page 33 of
 
00:21:42.710 --> 00:21:42.720 align:start position:0%
our side by-side comparison uh we did
 
00:21:44.750 --> 00:21:44.760 align:start position:0%
have in there for if a person had been
 
00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:48.480 align:start position:0%
arrested if it was a if it was a you
 
00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:52.200 align:start position:0%
know a specific crime that had like a
 
00:21:56.190 --> 00:21:56.200 align:start position:0%
victim if you will and a violence crime
 
00:21:58.149 --> 00:21:58.159 align:start position:0%
and we had where if the person was going
 
00:21:59.870 --> 00:21:59.880 align:start position:0%
to be police that there would be um
 
00:22:02.549 --> 00:22:02.559 align:start position:0%
ankle monitoring like a bracelet and
 
00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:06.120 align:start position:0%
that the police would notify the victim
 
00:22:08.669 --> 00:22:08.679 align:start position:0%
um give the give about an hour if you
 
00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:10.640 align:start position:0%
will um for the victim to be able to if
 
00:22:12.470 --> 00:22:12.480 align:start position:0%
they feel like they need to be get to
 
00:22:15.630 --> 00:22:15.640 align:start position:0%
safety and I noticed that the
 
00:22:18.149 --> 00:22:18.159 align:start position:0%
notification had been removed and I
 
00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:20.320 align:start position:0%
wasn't sure if that was uh if that was
 
00:22:22.590 --> 00:22:22.600 align:start position:0%
meant to be removed um if it was I would
 
00:22:25.149 --> 00:22:25.159 align:start position:0%
like to discuss the possibility of of
 
00:22:26.590 --> 00:22:26.600 align:start position:0%
having that in there I think it's very
 
00:22:28.830 --> 00:22:28.840 align:start position:0%
very important um for the victims safety
 
00:22:31.110 --> 00:22:31.120 align:start position:0%
for the victim's uh sense of security
 
00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:33.080 align:start position:0%
and my understanding is that there will
 
00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:36.640 align:start position:0%
be no fiscal responsibility at all um
 
00:22:39.430 --> 00:22:39.440 align:start position:0%
and they also I do know victim Advocates
 
00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:41.320 align:start position:0%
do let some somebody know if a person is
 
00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
being released from incarceration you
 
00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:44.320 align:start position:0%
know prior to their release they their
 
00:22:46.190 --> 00:22:46.200 align:start position:0%
notified of that so I would really like
 
00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:49.440 align:start position:0%
to see if we can discuss that and have
 
00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:52.120 align:start position:0%
that okay be put back in there uh
 
00:22:54.110 --> 00:22:54.120 align:start position:0%
representative do you want to tie that
 
00:22:57.230 --> 00:22:57.240 align:start position:0%
to violent crimes only because if you
 
00:22:59.630 --> 00:22:59.640 align:start position:0%
have what would be constituted as a
 
00:23:01.669 --> 00:23:01.679 align:start position:0%
victimless crime you don't want the
 
00:23:04.149 --> 00:23:04.159 align:start position:0%
police to have to just go notify
 
00:23:06.190 --> 00:23:06.200 align:start position:0%
everybody in a particular neighborhood
 
00:23:08.350 --> 00:23:08.360 align:start position:0%
that this person is out I think it would
 
00:23:10.549 --> 00:23:10.559 align:start position:0%
be more appropriate if someone has been
 
00:23:13.070 --> 00:23:13.080 align:start position:0%
a victim of a crime that they be
 
00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
notified but we also don't want to tie
 
00:23:20.190 --> 00:23:20.200 align:start position:0%
the hands of the police and it really
 
00:23:23.549 --> 00:23:23.559 align:start position:0%
comes down to um what is reasonable what
 
00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:25.600 align:start position:0%
is a reasonable effort and I think if we
 
00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:29.440 align:start position:0%
can agree on that the police will make a
 
00:23:32.269 --> 00:23:32.279 align:start position:0%
reasonable effort rather than a time
 
00:23:35.269 --> 00:23:35.279 align:start position:0%
frame um and and really leave it up to
 
00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:38.080 align:start position:0%
them to decide whether or not um you
 
00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:39.520 align:start position:0%
know how they're going to be able to
 
00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
contact the victim I think a reasonable
 
00:23:44.630 --> 00:23:44.640 align:start position:0%
effort would work for the Senate so uh
 
00:23:46.950 --> 00:23:46.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Senator if I may yeah uh
 
00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:48.520 align:start position:0%
basically everything you said is is what
 
00:23:50.830 --> 00:23:50.840 align:start position:0%
I was thinking I I wasn't looking at if
 
00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
a person you know if it was involved in
 
00:23:53.870 --> 00:23:53.880 align:start position:0%
like a shoplifting or anything like that
 
00:23:56.669 --> 00:23:56.679 align:start position:0%
I I was looking at more of a a a
 
00:23:56.679 --> 00:23:58.590 align:start position:0%
I I was looking at more of a a a
personal

00:23:58.590 --> 00:23:58.600 align:start position:0%
personal
 
00:24:01.669 --> 00:24:01.679 align:start position:0%
a a a personal crime against a person if
 
00:24:03.310 --> 00:24:03.320 align:start position:0%
it's a you know domestic violence of
 
00:24:05.390 --> 00:24:05.400 align:start position:0%
course is something we hear about a lot
 
00:24:09.430 --> 00:24:09.440 align:start position:0%
um if it's any kind of a a an assault it
 
00:24:10.909 --> 00:24:10.919 align:start position:0%
doesn't even have to be a sexual assault
 
00:24:12.350 --> 00:24:12.360 align:start position:0%
but you know even even of course an
 
00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
attack I think that it would be it would
 
00:24:16.269 --> 00:24:16.279 align:start position:0%
be in the victim's best interest to be
 
00:24:17.950 --> 00:24:17.960 align:start position:0%
able to at least have you know a heads
 
00:24:19.269 --> 00:24:19.279 align:start position:0%
up that that person is being released
 
00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:21.960 align:start position:0%
you know on bail uh we had originally
 
00:24:24.470 --> 00:24:24.480 align:start position:0%
put in there an hour and we thought well
 
00:24:26.430 --> 00:24:26.440 align:start position:0%
if the officer or you know someone in
 
00:24:27.669 --> 00:24:27.679 align:start position:0%
the police department makes a phone call
 
00:24:28.750 --> 00:24:28.760 align:start position:0%
they're not able to get hold of the
 
00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:30.720 align:start position:0%
person possibly drive out there leave a
 
00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:33.120 align:start position:0%
note at the door that's all very very
 
00:24:35.870 --> 00:24:35.880 align:start position:0%
easily documented in my opinion and when
 
00:24:38.590 --> 00:24:38.600 align:start position:0%
when we talked about this I do know that
 
00:24:40.870 --> 00:24:40.880 align:start position:0%
everybody that testified nobody nobody
 
00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:42.360 align:start position:0%
raised any kind of concern that they
 
00:24:43.789 --> 00:24:43.799 align:start position:0%
didn't think it was going to be possible
 
00:24:45.470 --> 00:24:45.480 align:start position:0%
or if it was going to be you know too
 
00:24:48.110 --> 00:24:48.120 align:start position:0%
encumbersome to the department I think
 
00:24:50.149 --> 00:24:50.159 align:start position:0%
that um I think the reasonable effort
 
00:24:53.590 --> 00:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
though is is acceptable I to your point
 
00:24:55.669 --> 00:24:55.679 align:start position:0%
uh it's very difficult to micromanage
 
00:24:58.110 --> 00:24:58.120 align:start position:0%
police work from from this building and
 
00:24:59.669 --> 00:24:59.679 align:start position:0%
when you say you have an hour you know
 
00:25:00.870 --> 00:25:00.880 align:start position:0%
what does that mean do you have to spend
 
00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:02.640 align:start position:0%
the whole hour doing it I mean I think
 
00:25:04.350 --> 00:25:04.360 align:start position:0%
if we put in there a reasonable effort
 
00:25:05.950 --> 00:25:05.960 align:start position:0%
shall be made by the law enforcement to
 
00:25:09.149 --> 00:25:09.159 align:start position:0%
notify victims prior to a an as salant
 
00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:11.360 align:start position:0%
being released I think the house would
 
00:25:13.110 --> 00:25:13.120 align:start position:0%
would like that does do my colleagues
 
00:25:15.149 --> 00:25:15.159 align:start position:0%
all agree with that representative here
 
00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:17.600 align:start position:0%
G oh good so I think we have an
 
00:25:19.470 --> 00:25:19.480 align:start position:0%
agreement on that okay excellent thank
 
00:25:21.950 --> 00:25:21.960 align:start position:0%
you Senator representative Murray I just
 
00:25:24.590 --> 00:25:24.600 align:start position:0%
wanted to check that do we are we in an
 
00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:26.480 align:start position:0%
agreement in terms of like the language
 
00:25:29.389 --> 00:25:29.399 align:start position:0%
that was here for um um it being a crime
 
00:25:31.710 --> 00:25:31.720 align:start position:0%
of violence against an individual person
 
00:25:33.389 --> 00:25:33.399 align:start position:0%
including any Act of stalking or
 
00:25:35.470 --> 00:25:35.480 align:start position:0%
criminal threatening yeah that pretty
 
00:25:38.590 --> 00:25:38.600 align:start position:0%
much covers what of course because at
 
00:25:40.549 --> 00:25:40.559 align:start position:0%
the end of the day if you make that
 
00:25:43.230 --> 00:25:43.240 align:start position:0%
reasonable effort to notify that person
 
00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:45.720 align:start position:0%
then can go to the court immediately get
 
00:25:47.870 --> 00:25:47.880 align:start position:0%
an and have an experte Hearing in a
 
00:25:49.549 --> 00:25:49.559 align:start position:0%
restraining order if they feel they need
 
00:25:53.230 --> 00:25:53.240 align:start position:0%
to have that so um I'm I'm I'm okay with
 
00:25:55.230 --> 00:25:55.240 align:start position:0%
that I think it's the right thing to do
 
00:25:57.430 --> 00:25:57.440 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman would we keep the July of
 
00:26:00.830 --> 00:26:00.840 align:start position:0%
2024 or the start date on that the the
 
00:26:02.470 --> 00:26:02.480 align:start position:0%
effective date on that I can't see a
 
00:26:04.870 --> 00:26:04.880 align:start position:0%
reason not to that unless the Senate has
 
00:26:06.789 --> 00:26:06.799 align:start position:0%
an alternative I mean that's just a
 
00:26:08.149 --> 00:26:08.159 align:start position:0%
matter of them start I'm just looking at
 
00:26:09.830 --> 00:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
our list of dates so I that was what I
 
00:26:11.350 --> 00:26:11.360 align:start position:0%
put down there okay thank the only time
 
00:26:12.669 --> 00:26:12.679 align:start position:0%
that the dates come into issue is when
 
00:26:14.350 --> 00:26:14.360 align:start position:0%
we start talking about money and I think
 
00:26:16.789 --> 00:26:16.799 align:start position:0%
that we'll keep a close eye on that
 
00:26:18.190 --> 00:26:18.200 align:start position:0%
representative Harry gather do you have
 
00:26:20.750 --> 00:26:20.760 align:start position:0%
an issue that you wanted to
 
00:26:22.789 --> 00:26:22.799 align:start position:0%
address might want to pull that closer
 
00:26:26.350 --> 00:26:26.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:29.510 --> 00:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
right right well thank you thank you all
 
00:26:32.029 --> 00:26:32.039 align:start position:0%
for being here and appreciate this time
 
00:26:34.190 --> 00:26:34.200 align:start position:0%
to actually discuss this
 
00:26:38.149 --> 00:26:38.159 align:start position:0%
318 um my concern was the magistrates
 
00:26:40.549 --> 00:26:40.559 align:start position:0%
and um it's sort of been like a real
 
00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:44.080 align:start position:0%
baby for me in terms of I think we asked
 
00:26:46.990 --> 00:26:47.000 align:start position:0%
for 15 originally um and at some point
 
00:26:49.789 --> 00:26:49.799 align:start position:0%
we were down to 10 another point we were
 
00:26:54.149 --> 00:26:54.159 align:start position:0%
at 5 and now we're at three so
 
00:26:56.870 --> 00:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
um for the work that they have to do I
 
00:26:58.510 --> 00:26:58.520 align:start position:0%
would say that it's almost almost
 
00:27:00.590 --> 00:27:00.600 align:start position:0%
impossible for them to get that work
 
00:27:02.789 --> 00:27:02.799 align:start position:0%
done with just three magistrates
 
00:27:04.029 --> 00:27:04.039 align:start position:0%
obviously they would be probably be
 
00:27:07.630 --> 00:27:07.640 align:start position:0%
working quite a bit so um my request is
 
00:27:09.909 --> 00:27:09.919 align:start position:0%
that at least we try to go back to at
 
00:27:14.750 --> 00:27:14.760 align:start position:0%
least five and maybe um next year put
 
00:27:16.470 --> 00:27:16.480 align:start position:0%
something in there for the traditional
 
00:27:19.350 --> 00:27:19.360 align:start position:0%
five but even if we don't do that piece
 
00:27:21.070 --> 00:27:21.080 align:start position:0%
I do believe that based on the work that
 
00:27:23.190 --> 00:27:23.200 align:start position:0%
they would be doing that um the judicial
 
00:27:24.630 --> 00:27:24.640 align:start position:0%
system would probably be asking for
 
00:27:27.830 --> 00:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
magistrates anyway within their budget
 
00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:28.870 align:start position:0%
magistrates anyway within their budget
so

00:27:28.870 --> 00:27:28.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:27:30.630 --> 00:27:30.640 align:start position:0%
and before you respond I just I and I
 
00:27:32.070 --> 00:27:32.080 align:start position:0%
didn't do it I want to give
 
00:27:34.110 --> 00:27:34.120 align:start position:0%
representative GA credit the the the
 
00:27:35.870 --> 00:27:35.880 align:start position:0%
whole concept of magistrates has been
 
00:27:37.950 --> 00:27:37.960 align:start position:0%
hers and she brought it up I think this
 
00:27:39.669 --> 00:27:39.679 align:start position:0%
is what the fourth year we've we've deal
 
00:27:42.110 --> 00:27:42.120 align:start position:0%
with that so um I think the concept
 
00:27:45.149 --> 00:27:45.159 align:start position:0%
itself is is a is really a great concept
 
00:27:46.669 --> 00:27:46.679 align:start position:0%
and I hopefully the court will be able
 
00:27:48.909 --> 00:27:48.919 align:start position:0%
to take advantage of it to utilize these
 
00:27:51.190 --> 00:27:51.200 align:start position:0%
quasi judicial officers in a way to to
 
00:27:53.190 --> 00:27:53.200 align:start position:0%
free up the judges so that we can get
 
00:27:56.070 --> 00:27:56.080 align:start position:0%
these backlogs moved along so anyway
 
00:27:59.870 --> 00:27:59.880 align:start position:0%
thank you um um I can resp respond um
 
00:28:02.230 --> 00:28:02.240 align:start position:0%
this is a new program and one of the
 
00:28:05.230 --> 00:28:05.240 align:start position:0%
things that we had talked about doing is
 
00:28:08.710 --> 00:28:08.720 align:start position:0%
tying the magistrates at this point to
 
00:28:11.630 --> 00:28:11.640 align:start position:0%
the violent crime aspect so the only
 
00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:13.360 align:start position:0%
time they would be involved is when
 
00:28:15.630 --> 00:28:15.640 align:start position:0%
someone is being accused of a violent
 
00:28:17.669 --> 00:28:17.679 align:start position:0%
crime the bail Commissioners can take
 
00:28:21.110 --> 00:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
care of all the smaller issues um and I
 
00:28:23.870 --> 00:28:23.880 align:start position:0%
think that's a good division of work um
 
00:28:26.909 --> 00:28:26.919 align:start position:0%
we looked at the cost of having more
 
00:28:28.630 --> 00:28:28.640 align:start position:0%
than three which was
 
00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:31.760 align:start position:0%
expensive and we're not in a budget year
 
00:28:33.789 --> 00:28:33.799 align:start position:0%
and yesterday I had a conversation with
 
00:28:36.669 --> 00:28:36.679 align:start position:0%
the Chief Justice and he was fine with
 
00:28:39.149 --> 00:28:39.159 align:start position:0%
the three to begin as long as they're
 
00:28:42.190 --> 00:28:42.200 align:start position:0%
tied to violent crimes only but I think
 
00:28:44.750 --> 00:28:44.760 align:start position:0%
it's important to realize that if they
 
00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
need more they can always go to fiscal
 
00:28:50.190 --> 00:28:50.200 align:start position:0%
and they can ask for more and next year
 
00:28:53.110 --> 00:28:53.120 align:start position:0%
is a budget year and we will have had
 
00:28:56.310 --> 00:28:56.320 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to uh to have to see the
 
00:28:58.509 --> 00:28:58.519 align:start position:0%
magistrates and how they're working and
 
00:29:01.070 --> 00:29:01.080 align:start position:0%
if we need to make Corrections we're in
 
00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:04.240 align:start position:0%
a budget year so if the court feels they
 
00:29:07.470 --> 00:29:07.480 align:start position:0%
need more they can make the request but
 
00:29:09.950 --> 00:29:09.960 align:start position:0%
we just felt very comfortable because of
 
00:29:13.590 --> 00:29:13.600 align:start position:0%
the cost um of the magistrates and we're
 
00:29:16.909 --> 00:29:16.919 align:start position:0%
not in a budget year we arrived at three
 
00:29:18.789 --> 00:29:18.799 align:start position:0%
as long as they're tied to violent
 
00:29:18.799 --> 00:29:19.669 align:start position:0%
as long as they're tied to violent
crimes

00:29:19.669 --> 00:29:19.679 align:start position:0%
crimes
 
00:29:22.269 --> 00:29:22.279 align:start position:0%
only is it the position to send that
 
00:29:23.669 --> 00:29:23.679 align:start position:0%
that's the best you can do is the three
 
00:29:25.470 --> 00:29:25.480 align:start position:0%
yeah that's that is the best we can do
 
00:29:28.110 --> 00:29:28.120 align:start position:0%
at this point okay we'll we'll put it
 
00:29:29.710 --> 00:29:29.720 align:start position:0%
pin in that for a minute um
 
00:29:31.350 --> 00:29:31.360 align:start position:0%
representative Murray I'm sorry did you
 
00:29:32.830 --> 00:29:32.840 align:start position:0%
have any other issues you want
 
00:29:34.029 --> 00:29:34.039 align:start position:0%
representative Murray did you have an
 
00:29:36.149 --> 00:29:36.159 align:start position:0%
issue that you wanted to bring
 
00:29:38.389 --> 00:29:38.399 align:start position:0%
out um I mean the biggest thing on my
 
00:29:40.070 --> 00:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
mind was the money for the bail tracking
 
00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:42.200 align:start position:0%
system but do we agree at the beginning
 
00:29:43.870 --> 00:29:43.880 align:start position:0%
that that's I think you had something
 
00:29:46.029 --> 00:29:46.039 align:start position:0%
regarding homeless people or um you
 
00:29:49.430 --> 00:29:49.440 align:start position:0%
wanted to the the oh um the language
 
00:29:51.509 --> 00:29:51.519 align:start position:0%
that was removed in terms of sudden cash
 
00:29:53.830 --> 00:29:53.840 align:start position:0%
bail for Indigent people like people who
 
00:29:58.830 --> 00:29:58.840 align:start position:0%
can't um afford it that was removed and
 
00:30:01.149 --> 00:30:01.159 align:start position:0%
I think that's really important to us
 
00:30:04.750 --> 00:30:04.760 align:start position:0%
that we can um not roll back the parts
 
00:30:07.590 --> 00:30:07.600 align:start position:0%
of uh the bail reform originally that
 
00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:09.440 align:start position:0%
were to protect people from being held
 
00:30:12.430 --> 00:30:12.440 align:start position:0%
simply because they can't afford bail um
 
00:30:13.669 --> 00:30:13.679 align:start position:0%
and so we were wondering if that's
 
00:30:15.549 --> 00:30:15.559 align:start position:0%
language that we could insert back into
 
00:30:18.190 --> 00:30:18.200 align:start position:0%
the bill yeah I think that I think that
 
00:30:20.870 --> 00:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
what where our goal is uh I think and we
 
00:30:24.870 --> 00:30:24.880 align:start position:0%
all agree cash bail really isn't for
 
00:30:26.070 --> 00:30:26.080 align:start position:0%
people who are dangerous if they're
 
00:30:28.549 --> 00:30:28.559 align:start position:0%
dangerous they need to stay in jail um
 
00:30:30.430 --> 00:30:30.440 align:start position:0%
cash bail is to ensure someone who might
 
00:30:33.149 --> 00:30:33.159 align:start position:0%
not otherwise show back up to court and
 
00:30:34.470 --> 00:30:34.480 align:start position:0%
and it should hurt them but it shouldn't
 
00:30:36.830 --> 00:30:36.840 align:start position:0%
be used to trap them so I feel like if
 
00:30:39.549 --> 00:30:39.559 align:start position:0%
maybe we use the language of the court
 
00:30:41.029 --> 00:30:41.039 align:start position:0%
that the court already has the standard
 
00:30:43.630 --> 00:30:43.640 align:start position:0%
of incy um that might be something we
 
00:30:45.710 --> 00:30:45.720 align:start position:0%
could use to say if they meet that
 
00:30:47.630 --> 00:30:47.640 align:start position:0%
standard then they can't have cash bail
 
00:30:48.950 --> 00:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
higher than they can afford right and
 
00:30:50.830 --> 00:30:50.840 align:start position:0%
that was the original purpose of bail
 
00:30:52.750 --> 00:30:52.760 align:start position:0%
reform is that we did not want to be
 
00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:54.149 align:start position:0%
reform is that we did not want to be
holding

00:30:54.149 --> 00:30:54.159 align:start position:0%
holding
 
00:30:56.590 --> 00:30:56.600 align:start position:0%
individuals just because they were poor
 
00:30:59.509 --> 00:30:59.519 align:start position:0%
yeah and so we can work around some
 
00:31:01.509 --> 00:31:01.519 align:start position:0%
language to get that in place we have no
 
00:31:03.389 --> 00:31:03.399 align:start position:0%
problem with doing that it's just making
 
00:31:07.070 --> 00:31:07.080 align:start position:0%
sure we get the right language okay I if
 
00:31:09.669 --> 00:31:09.679 align:start position:0%
I could jump in sure absolutely I'm in
 
00:31:13.149 --> 00:31:13.159 align:start position:0%
agreement with that as long as you know
 
00:31:14.909 --> 00:31:14.919 align:start position:0%
the parameters of what we're trying to
 
00:31:17.789 --> 00:31:17.799 align:start position:0%
do with the crimes that are articulated
 
00:31:20.310 --> 00:31:20.320 align:start position:0%
in this doesn't automatically give
 
00:31:22.509 --> 00:31:22.519 align:start position:0%
somebody a pass just because they're in
 
00:31:23.750 --> 00:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
oh no I don't think it should touch at
 
00:31:25.029 --> 00:31:25.039 align:start position:0%
all on the fact we have that list of
 
00:31:27.389 --> 00:31:27.399 align:start position:0%
crimes that that that this just this
 
00:31:29.070 --> 00:31:29.080 align:start position:0%
would only be for people who are
 
00:31:31.470 --> 00:31:31.480 align:start position:0%
eligible for cash bail that list would
 
00:31:33.269 --> 00:31:33.279 align:start position:0%
not be eligible just based on the nature
 
00:31:35.110 --> 00:31:35.120 align:start position:0%
of that crime so I think we're covered
 
00:31:37.269 --> 00:31:37.279 align:start position:0%
on that and I would agree with you 100%
 
00:31:39.190 --> 00:31:39.200 align:start position:0%
this is where they say okay we would
 
00:31:41.110 --> 00:31:41.120 align:start position:0%
like to make sure this fellow terms or
 
00:31:43.629 --> 00:31:43.639 align:start position:0%
this um woman comes back for her Court
 
00:31:46.070 --> 00:31:46.080 align:start position:0%
dat we're going to set cash bail we all
 
00:31:48.669 --> 00:31:48.679 align:start position:0%
know that if you set F cash bail at $500
 
00:31:49.990 --> 00:31:50.000 align:start position:0%
on a homeless person you might as well
 
00:31:52.389 --> 00:31:52.399 align:start position:0%
have just said he's not getting bail so
 
00:31:54.029 --> 00:31:54.039 align:start position:0%
we just want to avoid that situation so
 
00:31:56.310 --> 00:31:56.320 align:start position:0%
if we use the court standard for urgency
 
00:31:58.389 --> 00:31:58.399 align:start position:0%
like we agreed to I think we'll be fine
 
00:32:00.870 --> 00:32:00.880 align:start position:0%
um and I think that was that was it for
 
00:32:04.590 --> 00:32:04.600 align:start position:0%
the house um so if you would mind um
 
00:32:06.669 --> 00:32:06.679 align:start position:0%
could we take a 10-minute recess and
 
00:32:08.470 --> 00:32:08.480 align:start position:0%
discuss the one thing that we still have
 
00:32:10.789 --> 00:32:10.799 align:start position:0%
to come to agreement on the number of
 
00:32:13.950 --> 00:32:13.960 align:start position:0%
magistrates um and then reconvene 10
 
00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:23.230 align:start position:0%
magistrates um and then reconvene 10
minutes

00:32:23.230 --> 00:32:23.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:44.830 --> 00:32:44.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:47.830 --> 00:32:47.840 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman it to to answer U Mr
 
00:32:50.750 --> 00:32:50.760 align:start position:0%
President's it starts on on the side by
 
00:32:55.430 --> 00:32:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:26.750 --> 00:33:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:56.710 align:start position:0%
 
for

00:33:56.710 --> 00:33:56.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:56.720 --> 00:34:26.710 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:34:26.710 --> 00:34:26.720 align:start position:0%

00:39:56.309 --> 00:39:56.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:56.319 --> 00:40:26.309 align:start position:0%

00:40:26.309 --> 00:40:26.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:26.319 --> 00:40:56.230 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:40:56.230 --> 00:40:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:56.240 --> 00:41:26.230 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:41:26.230 --> 00:41:26.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:19.990 --> 00:42:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:22.910 --> 00:42:22.920 align:start position:0%
okay we're back on the record um we've
 
00:42:26.150 --> 00:42:26.160 align:start position:0%
had a chance to talk um have um you know
 
00:42:28.069 --> 00:42:28.079 align:start position:0%
we we would still like to see if you
 
00:42:30.750 --> 00:42:30.760 align:start position:0%
could do five if the money's there okay
 
00:42:33.589 --> 00:42:33.599 align:start position:0%
je well we talked about that so I think
 
00:42:37.349 --> 00:42:37.359 align:start position:0%
a rational way to proceed is to allow um
 
00:42:39.030 --> 00:42:39.040 align:start position:0%
a request to be made of the fiscal
 
00:42:41.069 --> 00:42:41.079 align:start position:0%
committee for up to five we're
 
00:42:44.349 --> 00:42:44.359 align:start position:0%
authorizing three this is something that
 
00:42:47.710 --> 00:42:47.720 align:start position:0%
fiscal um routinely does yeah and I
 
00:42:50.750 --> 00:42:50.760 align:start position:0%
think that would if there's a need for
 
00:42:53.710 --> 00:42:53.720 align:start position:0%
five that will clearly be able to come
 
00:42:58.069 --> 00:42:58.079 align:start position:0%
before fiscal yeah um you know for next
 
00:43:00.990 --> 00:43:01.000 align:start position:0%
June when there's a new budget okay so
 
00:43:03.349 --> 00:43:03.359 align:start position:0%
we're guaranteed the three and if fiscal
 
00:43:05.790 --> 00:43:05.800 align:start position:0%
approves the next two yes we'll get the
 
00:43:07.549 --> 00:43:07.559 align:start position:0%
five and then from then on it's up to
 
00:43:10.270 --> 00:43:10.280 align:start position:0%
the court in the budget is that correct
 
00:43:12.549 --> 00:43:12.559 align:start position:0%
great I think that was our final thing
 
00:43:13.630 --> 00:43:13.640 align:start position:0%
we would just want to make sure the
 
00:43:16.390 --> 00:43:16.400 align:start position:0%
language is correct on the indigency um
 
00:43:18.630 --> 00:43:18.640 align:start position:0%
the language we put in the original bill
 
00:43:20.349 --> 00:43:20.359 align:start position:0%
um what was it again
 
00:43:22.790 --> 00:43:22.800 align:start position:0%
Alie the court shall have the authority
 
00:43:24.589 --> 00:43:24.599 align:start position:0%
under paragraph one to set a cash bail
 
00:43:26.430 --> 00:43:26.440 align:start position:0%
amount only if it is an amount which the
 
00:43:30.030 --> 00:43:30.040 align:start position:0%
defendant is able to meet um remember
 
00:43:36.030 --> 00:43:36.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:39.630 --> 00:43:39.640 align:start position:0%
you now I I'm not married to the exact
 
00:43:41.510 --> 00:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
language but I am married to the exact
 
00:43:43.349 --> 00:43:43.359 align:start position:0%
meaning so the spirit of it yeah it's
 
00:43:46.230 --> 00:43:46.240 align:start position:0%
got to make sure that it does not um
 
00:43:48.270 --> 00:43:48.280 align:start position:0%
that bail is not being set to hold
 
00:43:50.430 --> 00:43:50.440 align:start position:0%
people okay that can't possibly meet
 
00:43:52.430 --> 00:43:52.440 align:start position:0%
that bail okay yeah if we want to make
 
00:43:55.910 --> 00:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
like a note that uh it applies with the
 
00:43:58.069 --> 00:43:58.079 align:start position:0%
indigency like definition according to
 
00:43:59.750 --> 00:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
the courts or something that would be
 
00:44:03.109 --> 00:44:03.119 align:start position:0%
fine I think so I propose go ahead Mr
 
00:44:06.470 --> 00:44:06.480 align:start position:0%
chairman um real quick if you you could
 
00:44:09.030 --> 00:44:09.040 align:start position:0%
take a look at this the effective date
 
00:44:10.390 --> 00:44:10.400 align:start position:0%
uh one of the effective dates for
 
00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:11.390 align:start position:0%
uh one of the effective dates for
January

00:44:11.390 --> 00:44:11.400 align:start position:0%
January
 
00:44:13.750 --> 00:44:13.760 align:start position:0%
2025 I'm just wondering if that was an
 
00:44:15.430 --> 00:44:15.440 align:start position:0%
oversight if it should be I'm going to
 
00:44:16.790 --> 00:44:16.800 align:start position:0%
have you just look at it because it's
 
00:44:18.190 --> 00:44:18.200 align:start position:0%
the list of everything we just talked
 
00:44:19.950 --> 00:44:19.960 align:start position:0%
about and I'm not really sure why we
 
00:44:21.470 --> 00:44:21.480 align:start position:0%
would have it not start until the
 
00:44:22.870 --> 00:44:22.880 align:start position:0%
beginning of next year not with
 
00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:24.390 align:start position:0%
beginning of next year not with
everything

00:44:24.390 --> 00:44:24.400 align:start position:0%
everything
 
00:44:27.670 --> 00:44:27.680 align:start position:0%
else who set those dates did we or did
 
00:44:30.309 --> 00:44:30.319 align:start position:0%
a little bit of I don't know probably
 
00:44:32.589 --> 00:44:32.599 align:start position:0%
both I think I think both but I think
 
00:44:34.109 --> 00:44:34.119 align:start position:0%
honestly I think some of it was in
 
00:44:35.430 --> 00:44:35.440 align:start position:0%
oversight I don't think that it was
 
00:44:37.270 --> 00:44:37.280 align:start position:0%
meant to not I don't think that they
 
00:44:39.109 --> 00:44:39.119 align:start position:0%
were meant to not you know communicate
 
00:44:40.230 --> 00:44:40.240 align:start position:0%
with each other I just think it might be
 
00:44:42.309 --> 00:44:42.319 align:start position:0%
the way that it ended up happening so if
 
00:44:43.510 --> 00:44:43.520 align:start position:0%
we're going to do the amendment I would
 
00:44:45.349 --> 00:44:45.359 align:start position:0%
think that now would be the time I I
 
00:44:47.030 --> 00:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
think um I had asked our researcher I
 
00:44:48.829 --> 00:44:48.839 align:start position:0%
think you guys should also have a a copy
 
00:44:52.190 --> 00:44:52.200 align:start position:0%
of that of the the effect of start dates
 
00:44:53.990 --> 00:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah that so I'm looking at if you
 
00:44:57.270 --> 00:44:57.280 align:start position:0%
look at the second page on the bottom
 
00:44:59.630 --> 00:44:59.640 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious if those should
 
00:45:03.109 --> 00:45:03.119 align:start position:0%
start July when everything else is
 
00:45:06.109 --> 00:45:06.119 align:start position:0%
starting oh yeah the judicial training
 
00:45:07.190 --> 00:45:07.200 align:start position:0%
requirements is that what you're
 
00:45:09.870 --> 00:45:09.880 align:start position:0%
speaking about yeah so I I gave my copy
 
00:45:12.790 --> 00:45:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:16.270 --> 00:45:16.280 align:start position:0%
but so okay so it has effect of January
 
00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:17.829 align:start position:0%
but so okay so it has effect of January
1st

00:45:17.829 --> 00:45:17.839 align:start position:0%
1st
 
00:45:21.430 --> 00:45:21.440 align:start position:0%
2025 and but we had as an example you
 
00:45:24.750 --> 00:45:24.760 align:start position:0%
know the the the hour notific or the the
 
00:45:26.990 --> 00:45:27.000 align:start position:0%
notification of a person being releas
 
00:45:28.109 --> 00:45:28.119 align:start position:0%
person being released I think that's
 
00:45:32.790 --> 00:45:32.800 align:start position:0%
taking effect July 2024 so would we not
 
00:45:34.870 --> 00:45:34.880 align:start position:0%
want these
 
00:45:38.630 --> 00:45:38.640 align:start position:0%
other these other like bail Provisions
 
00:45:40.190 --> 00:45:40.200 align:start position:0%
Would we not want that also to take
 
00:45:41.870 --> 00:45:41.880 align:start position:0%
effect the end of July or do we want
 
00:45:44.030 --> 00:45:44.040 align:start position:0%
that to not take effect until a year
 
00:45:46.030 --> 00:45:46.040 align:start position:0%
from now I would think as long as I
 
00:45:47.670 --> 00:45:47.680 align:start position:0%
would think as long as there's no money
 
00:45:49.630 --> 00:45:49.640 align:start position:0%
or staffing issues it can take effect in
 
00:45:51.750 --> 00:45:51.760 align:start position:0%
July of this year if it's got a money
 
00:45:53.589 --> 00:45:53.599 align:start position:0%
Staffing or training issue the court
 
00:45:53.599 --> 00:45:55.190 align:start position:0%
Staffing or training issue the court
it's

00:45:55.190 --> 00:45:55.200 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:45:57.950 --> 00:45:57.960 align:start position:0%
like we well absolutely please approach
 
00:46:02.589 --> 00:46:02.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:05.069 --> 00:46:05.079 align:start position:0%
add hello sorry for the folks watching
 
00:46:07.230 --> 00:46:07.240 align:start position:0%
at home Aron crean judicial branch
 
00:46:09.549 --> 00:46:09.559 align:start position:0%
general counsel there's just a period of
 
00:46:11.510 --> 00:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
time to change our forms to train our
 
00:46:15.150 --> 00:46:15.160 align:start position:0%
judges to to we're not able to do it
 
00:46:17.270 --> 00:46:17.280 align:start position:0%
that that that would be a few weeks to
 
00:46:18.950 --> 00:46:18.960 align:start position:0%
get that all done so we we typically do
 
00:46:21.150 --> 00:46:21.160 align:start position:0%
all of that for January 1 every year so
 
00:46:22.790 --> 00:46:22.800 align:start position:0%
it's often the case that when bills
 
00:46:24.309 --> 00:46:24.319 align:start position:0%
affecting the court take effect their
 
00:46:25.630 --> 00:46:25.640 align:start position:0%
January so we can do all the form
 
00:46:27.710 --> 00:46:27.720 align:start position:0%
redesign all the high Hing all the
 
00:46:29.670 --> 00:46:29.680 align:start position:0%
judicial training all at the same time
 
00:46:31.230 --> 00:46:31.240 align:start position:0%
okay that makes sense all right so what
 
00:46:33.349 --> 00:46:33.359 align:start position:0%
if we do this the notification piece
 
00:46:34.710 --> 00:46:34.720 align:start position:0%
that's something that could save lives
 
00:46:37.150 --> 00:46:37.160 align:start position:0%
that could take effect this this July
 
00:46:38.309 --> 00:46:38.319 align:start position:0%
that just means the police start
 
00:46:40.230 --> 00:46:40.240 align:start position:0%
notifying people if someone's getting
 
00:46:42.270 --> 00:46:42.280 align:start position:0%
bailed anything asked to do with the
 
00:46:45.630 --> 00:46:45.640 align:start position:0%
court or training January 2025 does that
 
00:46:47.950 --> 00:46:47.960 align:start position:0%
make sense that would make me feel much
 
00:46:49.230 --> 00:46:49.240 align:start position:0%
better Mr chairman can you make a note
 
00:46:50.790 --> 00:46:50.800 align:start position:0%
of that so that we because what I'm
 
00:46:52.309 --> 00:46:52.319 align:start position:0%
going to propose it it seems like we
 
00:46:54.910 --> 00:46:54.920 align:start position:0%
have an agreement yes why don't we uh
 
00:46:57.190 --> 00:46:57.200 align:start position:0%
recess till tomorrow at 1:00 until we
 
00:47:00.270 --> 00:47:00.280 align:start position:0%
have an actual document the final final
 
00:47:03.069 --> 00:47:03.079 align:start position:0%
document M because we know what happens
 
00:47:05.710 --> 00:47:05.720 align:start position:0%
sometimes um and then we will make our
 
00:47:08.109 --> 00:47:08.119 align:start position:0%
official agreement and uh sign off if
 
00:47:10.829 --> 00:47:10.839 align:start position:0%
that makes sense yep does everyone have
 
00:47:12.630 --> 00:47:12.640 align:start position:0%
time at one o'clock tomorrow no I don't
 
00:47:15.069 --> 00:47:15.079 align:start position:0%
but all righty I will be here we'll make
 
00:47:16.990 --> 00:47:17.000 align:start position:0%
it happen yeah okay all right and
 
00:47:19.470 --> 00:47:19.480 align:start position:0%
everyone here can make it all right so
 
00:47:21.190 --> 00:47:21.200 align:start position:0%
I'm done I'm going to recess to one
 
00:47:23.030 --> 00:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
tomorrow and we have an agreement in uh

01:01:35.390 --> 01:01:35.400 align:start position:0%
are so thank you um thank you very much
 
01:01:38.430 --> 01:01:38.440 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and we
 
01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:40.029 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and we
added

01:01:40.029 --> 01:01:40.039 align:start position:0%
added
 
01:01:43.990 --> 01:01:44.000 align:start position:0%
um Senate Bill 563 which is our
 
01:01:47.069 --> 01:01:47.079 align:start position:0%
Sanctuary City bill which you folks
 
01:01:51.750 --> 01:01:51.760 align:start position:0%
tabled I think 177 to 18 188 and we're
 
01:01:56.470 --> 01:01:56.480 align:start position:0%
hoping for a second shot at um in
 
01:01:58.789 --> 01:01:58.799 align:start position:0%
passage of sanctuary cities I I'm happy
 
01:02:00.309 --> 01:02:00.319 align:start position:0%
to talk about why I think they're
 
01:02:03.470 --> 01:02:03.480 align:start position:0%
important but I suspect that everybody
 
01:02:05.349 --> 01:02:05.359 align:start position:0%
has already heard me a thousand times on
 
01:02:06.670 --> 01:02:06.680 align:start position:0%
that and they know the arguments
 
01:02:08.630 --> 01:02:08.640 align:start position:0%
backwards and forwards it's up to you
 
01:02:12.150 --> 01:02:12.160 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to go into it further but I'll
 
01:02:14.029 --> 01:02:14.039 align:start position:0%
leave that to your
 
01:02:16.190 --> 01:02:16.200 align:start position:0%
discretion Well yeah if you could just a
 
01:02:18.230 --> 01:02:18.240 align:start position:0%
little background um a short background
 
01:02:20.750 --> 01:02:20.760 align:start position:0%
of what what now why now I think we all
 
01:02:22.710 --> 01:02:22.720 align:start position:0%
agree that there's an issue but why now
 
01:02:26.750 --> 01:02:26.760 align:start position:0%
would be helpful I think so um
 
01:02:29.470 --> 01:02:29.480 align:start position:0%
I think we need look no further than the
 
01:02:31.910 --> 01:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
difference between our state and our
 
01:02:34.990 --> 01:02:35.000 align:start position:0%
neighbor to the South which has um
 
01:02:37.670 --> 01:02:37.680 align:start position:0%
Sanctuary policies in place
 
01:02:39.750 --> 01:02:39.760 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts is spending almost a
 
01:02:42.870 --> 01:02:42.880 align:start position:0%
billion dollars annually to house and
 
01:02:45.349 --> 01:02:45.359 align:start position:0%
take care of migrants and our view in
 
01:02:49.269 --> 01:02:49.279 align:start position:0%
the Senate is that when you have an
 
01:02:51.589 --> 01:02:51.599 align:start position:0%
incentive to come to a State visa
 
01:02:54.630 --> 01:02:54.640 align:start position:0%
Sanctuary policies you will have more
 
01:02:56.910 --> 01:02:56.920 align:start position:0%
people coming to the state State because
 
01:03:01.349 --> 01:03:01.359 align:start position:0%
it becomes an incentive a magnet and um
 
01:03:03.470 --> 01:03:03.480 align:start position:0%
I think we are concerned about that
 
01:03:06.390 --> 01:03:06.400 align:start position:0%
we're concerned about um you know the
 
01:03:09.630 --> 01:03:09.640 align:start position:0%
ongoing drug prices human trafficking
 
01:03:12.150 --> 01:03:12.160 align:start position:0%
the potential of you know people coming
 
01:03:14.549 --> 01:03:14.559 align:start position:0%
in on the terror watch list I mean these
 
01:03:16.510 --> 01:03:16.520 align:start position:0%
are all issues somewhat beyond our
 
01:03:21.190 --> 01:03:21.200 align:start position:0%
control obviously um but you know myself
 
01:03:23.430 --> 01:03:23.440 align:start position:0%
and Senator Carson were on the northern
 
01:03:28.150 --> 01:03:28.160 align:start position:0%
border um several weeks ago we met with
 
01:03:30.910 --> 01:03:30.920 align:start position:0%
um Federal and local officials and state
 
01:03:33.269 --> 01:03:33.279 align:start position:0%
officials there that you know describe
 
01:03:36.870 --> 01:03:36.880 align:start position:0%
that situation so to me we have to do
 
01:03:39.549 --> 01:03:39.559 align:start position:0%
the things that we can do so what have
 
01:03:42.910 --> 01:03:42.920 align:start position:0%
we done we authorize 1.4 million in the
 
01:03:46.109 --> 01:03:46.119 align:start position:0%
budget last year to assist local law
 
01:03:48.349 --> 01:03:48.359 align:start position:0%
enforcement um we were told when we were
 
01:03:52.390 --> 01:03:52.400 align:start position:0%
in the northern border that's helping um
 
01:03:54.910 --> 01:03:54.920 align:start position:0%
the for anybody who hasn't been up there
 
01:03:58.190 --> 01:03:58.200 align:start position:0%
it's very remot and it quite frankly is
 
01:04:00.789 --> 01:04:00.799 align:start position:0%
very accessible from Canada you walk
 
01:04:04.109 --> 01:04:04.119 align:start position:0%
across a stream that's about as wide as
 
01:04:08.190 --> 01:04:08.200 align:start position:0%
this table and maybe that deep um and
 
01:04:10.190 --> 01:04:10.200 align:start position:0%
it's all woods and there's a beautiful
 
01:04:13.510 --> 01:04:13.520 align:start position:0%
dirt road and um you know so
 
01:04:17.670 --> 01:04:17.680 align:start position:0%
people can easily cross the border if
 
01:04:20.750 --> 01:04:20.760 align:start position:0%
that's their intention but because it is
 
01:04:23.390 --> 01:04:23.400 align:start position:0%
so remote in the town of Pittsburgh it's
 
01:04:25.870 --> 01:04:25.880 align:start position:0%
at the end of a s mile dirt road by by
 
01:04:28.109 --> 01:04:28.119 align:start position:0%
the time if a local residence and
 
01:04:30.269 --> 01:04:30.279 align:start position:0%
there's some there are some people on
 
01:04:33.470 --> 01:04:33.480 align:start position:0%
the that road big tracks of land farms
 
01:04:37.069 --> 01:04:37.079 align:start position:0%
da Farms um if they see somebody
 
01:04:42.870 --> 01:04:42.880 align:start position:0%
Crossing by the time folks would be able
 
01:04:45.630 --> 01:04:45.640 align:start position:0%
to come and do anything about it law
 
01:04:48.349 --> 01:04:48.359 align:start position:0%
enforcement it could be 45 minutes away
 
01:04:51.349 --> 01:04:51.359 align:start position:0%
so um while that's sort of a subset of
 
01:04:53.470 --> 01:04:53.480 align:start position:0%
the issue we're dealing with I think the
 
01:04:56.349 --> 01:04:56.359 align:start position:0%
sanctuary City bill is something that we
 
01:04:59.990 --> 01:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
can do to say
 
01:05:02.309 --> 01:05:02.319 align:start position:0%
um we're not going to create that kind
 
01:05:04.750 --> 01:05:04.760 align:start position:0%
of incentive and I and again I think we
 
01:05:06.309 --> 01:05:06.319 align:start position:0%
need to look no further than what's
 
01:05:08.549 --> 01:05:08.559 align:start position:0%
happened in Massachusetts the billion
 
01:05:11.029 --> 01:05:11.039 align:start position:0%
dollars people having
 
01:05:15.349 --> 01:05:15.359 align:start position:0%
to um requisition community centers
 
01:05:17.870 --> 01:05:17.880 align:start position:0%
Logan Airport I mean things like that
 
01:05:21.589 --> 01:05:21.599 align:start position:0%
for um housing of um folks that have
 
01:05:26.630 --> 01:05:26.640 align:start position:0%
crossed illegally so that's why um we're
 
01:05:30.069 --> 01:05:30.079 align:start position:0%
back at it again um it is a very
 
01:05:32.990 --> 01:05:33.000 align:start position:0%
important bill to the Senate are you
 
01:05:35.029 --> 01:05:35.039 align:start position:0%
aware that the version that almost
 
01:05:37.990 --> 01:05:38.000 align:start position:0%
passed the house had been amended I had
 
01:05:39.829 --> 01:05:39.839 align:start position:0%
um when it came to criminal justice I
 
01:05:42.470 --> 01:05:42.480 align:start position:0%
had amended it um because there was
 
01:05:45.069 --> 01:05:45.079 align:start position:0%
language in there that suggested um I
 
01:05:47.230 --> 01:05:47.240 align:start position:0%
believe it was the police shall take all
 
01:05:49.870 --> 01:05:49.880 align:start position:0%
possible efforts um that was felt to be
 
01:05:51.349 --> 01:05:51.359 align:start position:0%
pretty Broad and they were very
 
01:05:53.870 --> 01:05:53.880 align:start position:0%
concerned so I took that out and we got
 
01:05:56.349 --> 01:05:56.359 align:start position:0%
close with the amended language
 
01:05:59.670 --> 01:05:59.680 align:start position:0%
so what I would say is that um just
 
01:06:02.150 --> 01:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
speaking for myself and not for any of
 
01:06:04.710 --> 01:06:04.720 align:start position:0%
the other Senate conferees um that would
 
01:06:07.190 --> 01:06:07.200 align:start position:0%
be a rational compromise and if that's
 
01:06:08.789 --> 01:06:08.799 align:start position:0%
what this Committee of conference came
 
01:06:12.390 --> 01:06:12.400 align:start position:0%
to when you had a chance to sell it to
 
01:06:15.470 --> 01:06:15.480 align:start position:0%
your good folks in the house I would do
 
01:06:17.430 --> 01:06:17.440 align:start position:0%
everything I could to sell it to our
 
01:06:19.349 --> 01:06:19.359 align:start position:0%
Senators all right well let's hear from
 
01:06:22.269 --> 01:06:22.279 align:start position:0%
the other uh conferees representative
 
01:06:25.069 --> 01:06:25.079 align:start position:0%
rhs thank you Mr chairman I at this time
 
01:06:26.430 --> 01:06:26.440 align:start position:0%
I i y I don't have anything to say just
 
01:06:28.390 --> 01:06:28.400 align:start position:0%
yet okay representative Manion nothing
 
01:06:29.710 --> 01:06:29.720 align:start position:0%
representative M I assume you have
 
01:06:38.870 --> 01:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:41.950 align:start position:0%
 
say

01:06:41.950 --> 01:06:41.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:44.390 --> 01:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
when when this bill came before our
 
01:06:47.349 --> 01:06:47.359 align:start position:0%
committee uh I had a number of concerns
 
01:06:49.549 --> 01:06:49.559 align:start position:0%
and one of the biggest concerns is we
 
01:06:53.870 --> 01:06:53.880 align:start position:0%
got a letter uh from the heads of law
 
01:06:55.950 --> 01:06:55.960 align:start position:0%
enforcement uh from several of our
 
01:06:57.349 --> 01:06:57.359 align:start position:0%
communities including our largest
 
01:06:59.029 --> 01:06:59.039 align:start position:0%
community in the state
 
01:07:01.910 --> 01:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
Manchester basically urging us to kill
 
01:07:06.990 --> 01:07:07.000 align:start position:0%
this bill um and we have also heard uh
 
01:07:10.069 --> 01:07:10.079 align:start position:0%
from uh immigrant Rights group from the
 
01:07:14.230 --> 01:07:14.240 align:start position:0%
ACLU from uh from other folks in the
 
01:07:15.950 --> 01:07:15.960 align:start position:0%
house who are concerned with Liberty
 
01:07:18.069 --> 01:07:18.079 align:start position:0%
issues and around the due process
 
01:07:19.750 --> 01:07:19.760 align:start position:0%
problems that come with the tainers and
 
01:07:22.630 --> 01:07:22.640 align:start position:0%
things like that and the bottom line is
 
01:07:25.789 --> 01:07:25.799 align:start position:0%
that um the state should not be in the a
 
01:07:27.789 --> 01:07:27.799 align:start position:0%
business of enforcing a civil
 
01:07:30.710 --> 01:07:30.720 align:start position:0%
immigration detainer when that's the
 
01:07:35.950 --> 01:07:35.960 align:start position:0%
only thing that uh that an an immigrant
 
01:07:38.230 --> 01:07:38.240 align:start position:0%
uh can be charged with one of one of the
 
01:07:40.870 --> 01:07:40.880 align:start position:0%
issues that I had with representative
 
01:07:44.910 --> 01:07:44.920 align:start position:0%
Roy's uh representative Roy's amendment
 
01:07:48.069 --> 01:07:48.079 align:start position:0%
is it would actually open the door uh to
 
01:07:51.109 --> 01:07:51.119 align:start position:0%
anyone being charged who's subject to an
 
01:07:53.549 --> 01:07:53.559 align:start position:0%
investigation so it wouldn't even take
 
01:07:56.670 --> 01:07:56.680 align:start position:0%
arrest or jailing or something like that
 
01:07:59.069 --> 01:07:59.079 align:start position:0%
so one of the things we just did that
 
01:08:01.269 --> 01:08:01.279 align:start position:0%
was a really good thing together is we
 
01:08:04.589 --> 01:08:04.599 align:start position:0%
passed a racial profiling bill um if
 
01:08:06.710 --> 01:08:06.720 align:start position:0%
you're not extremely careful about how
 
01:08:08.710 --> 01:08:08.720 align:start position:0%
you implement this what you've done is
 
01:08:12.230 --> 01:08:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:17.309 --> 01:08:17.319 align:start position:0%
worse would would you think about this
 
01:08:20.070 --> 01:08:20.080 align:start position:0%
if we took the amended language and we
 
01:08:23.030 --> 01:08:23.040 align:start position:0%
made it strictly if you had been if if a
 
01:08:25.990 --> 01:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
person's arrested for a violation of New
 
01:08:28.470 --> 01:08:28.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law not questioned or stopped
 
01:08:30.550 --> 01:08:30.560 align:start position:0%
or anything like that only if they've
 
01:08:33.510 --> 01:08:33.520 align:start position:0%
already been arrested and then and only
 
01:08:37.309 --> 01:08:37.319 align:start position:0%
then it becomes to their attention that
 
01:08:40.070 --> 01:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
there it may be an immigration issue
 
01:08:42.749 --> 01:08:42.759 align:start position:0%
that then they should cooperate with the
 
01:08:44.149 --> 01:08:44.159 align:start position:0%
immigration enforcement would that make
 
01:08:46.269 --> 01:08:46.279 align:start position:0%
a difference to you so so my
 
01:08:47.669 --> 01:08:47.679 align:start position:0%
understanding is what that would do is
 
01:08:50.070 --> 01:08:50.080 align:start position:0%
just formalize the current policy that's
 
01:08:52.229 --> 01:08:52.239 align:start position:0%
actually in place in in many departments
 
01:08:54.269 --> 01:08:54.279 align:start position:0%
now yeah so when somebody's actually
 
01:08:55.829 --> 01:08:55.839 align:start position:0%
arrested for a crime and New Hampshire
 
01:08:57.189 --> 01:08:57.199 align:start position:0%
when they're jailed for a crime in New
 
01:08:59.789 --> 01:08:59.799 align:start position:0%
Hampshire if they if a detainer is out
 
01:09:01.789 --> 01:09:01.799 align:start position:0%
on them law enforcement will know about
 
01:09:05.349 --> 01:09:05.359 align:start position:0%
it and they will contact ice so there's
 
01:09:09.030 --> 01:09:09.040 align:start position:0%
nothing in the uh one of the reasons why
 
01:09:11.550 --> 01:09:11.560 align:start position:0%
they call the they differentiate between
 
01:09:13.990 --> 01:09:14.000 align:start position:0%
Sanctuary policies and and Sanctuary
 
01:09:17.590 --> 01:09:17.600 align:start position:0%
cities per se is none of the the cities
 
01:09:19.669 --> 01:09:19.679 align:start position:0%
that have actually passed the sanctuary
 
01:09:21.749 --> 01:09:21.759 align:start position:0%
policies in New Hampshire are doing
 
01:09:23.149 --> 01:09:23.159 align:start position:0%
anything that would get in the way of
 
01:09:24.669 --> 01:09:24.679 align:start position:0%
that because if they got in the way of
 
01:09:25.990 --> 01:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
that that would be a violation of
 
01:09:30.149 --> 01:09:30.159 align:start position:0%
federal law I believe um and I I trust
 
01:09:31.950 --> 01:09:31.960 align:start position:0%
me I don't want to be argumentative but
 
01:09:34.030 --> 01:09:34.040 align:start position:0%
one of the members of our committee I
 
01:09:37.990 --> 01:09:38.000 align:start position:0%
forgot where is she from um Kean the
 
01:09:40.030 --> 01:09:40.040 align:start position:0%
policy in Kean and you can look it up on
 
01:09:43.030 --> 01:09:43.040 align:start position:0%
their website is not to contact or
 
01:09:44.910 --> 01:09:44.920 align:start position:0%
cooperate with ice if if I'm not
 
01:09:48.229 --> 01:09:48.239 align:start position:0%
mistaken so be that as it may that so it
 
01:09:51.229 --> 01:09:51.239 align:start position:0%
it is happening and if if all we're
 
01:09:53.229 --> 01:09:53.239 align:start position:0%
doing is formalizing it I'm not sure
 
01:09:56.149 --> 01:09:56.159 align:start position:0%
that that that would be a problem um but
 
01:09:57.950 --> 01:09:57.960 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to hear your thoughts well I
 
01:10:00.070 --> 01:10:00.080 align:start position:0%
think part of it part of it is how you
 
01:10:04.110 --> 01:10:04.120 align:start position:0%
formalize it so for example one of the
 
01:10:05.990 --> 01:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
things I think people struggle with is
 
01:10:08.149 --> 01:10:08.159 align:start position:0%
the ambiguity of the language without
 
01:10:10.550 --> 01:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
something in New Hampshire statute so
 
01:10:12.110 --> 01:10:12.120 align:start position:0%
you know one of the reasons why we
 
01:10:14.709 --> 01:10:14.719 align:start position:0%
enacted the racial profiling bill is
 
01:10:16.350 --> 01:10:16.360 align:start position:0%
because we wanted to make that clear to
 
01:10:19.229 --> 01:10:19.239 align:start position:0%
people as a policy statement um there no
 
01:10:21.229 --> 01:10:21.239 align:start position:0%
penalties but we wanted to make it clear
 
01:10:23.590 --> 01:10:23.600 align:start position:0%
to people as a policy statement that
 
01:10:27.870 --> 01:10:27.880 align:start position:0%
that behavior uh uh was uh essentially
 
01:10:31.270 --> 01:10:31.280 align:start position:0%
was was unacceptable so I think one of
 
01:10:32.990 --> 01:10:33.000 align:start position:0%
the things that could be productive
 
01:10:36.070 --> 01:10:36.080 align:start position:0%
would be actually spelling out the
 
01:10:38.709 --> 01:10:38.719 align:start position:0%
guidelines of how officers are supposed
 
01:10:40.110 --> 01:10:40.120 align:start position:0%
to handle these
 
01:10:43.990 --> 01:10:44.000 align:start position:0%
situations um uh on the other on the
 
01:10:45.910 --> 01:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
other hand and and I think one of the
 
01:10:49.189 --> 01:10:49.199 align:start position:0%
things that I had given you at one point
 
01:10:53.790 --> 01:10:53.800 align:start position:0%
uh was an idea for an amendment that um
 
01:10:56.189 --> 01:10:56.199 align:start position:0%
uh that actually would have
 
01:10:59.550 --> 01:10:59.560 align:start position:0%
would have allowed communities to issue
 
01:11:01.990 --> 01:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
policies against
 
01:11:06.149 --> 01:11:06.159 align:start position:0%
Sanctuary so yeah that's fine but it
 
01:11:08.350 --> 01:11:08.360 align:start position:0%
also would have still left the dment for
 
01:11:10.750 --> 01:11:10.760 align:start position:0%
communities to have Sanctuary so it it
 
01:11:12.950 --> 01:11:12.960 align:start position:0%
kind and I mean the part of it that's
 
01:11:16.590 --> 01:11:16.600 align:start position:0%
part of my objection here too is this is
 
01:11:19.270 --> 01:11:19.280 align:start position:0%
you know essentially what we have in in
 
01:11:21.189 --> 01:11:21.199 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we have three communities
 
01:11:23.870 --> 01:11:23.880 align:start position:0%
where we have elected officials who have
 
01:11:28.750 --> 01:11:28.760 align:start position:0%
made a decision um uh to uh you know to
 
01:11:31.070 --> 01:11:31.080 align:start position:0%
to support this and and it's
 
01:11:33.630 --> 01:11:33.640 align:start position:0%
actually there's nothing in federal law
 
01:11:38.270 --> 01:11:38.280 align:start position:0%
that actually requires um local police
 
01:11:41.550 --> 01:11:41.560 align:start position:0%
to actually assist in the in the uh
 
01:11:43.870 --> 01:11:43.880 align:start position:0%
enforcement of a detainer right that's
 
01:11:46.870 --> 01:11:46.880 align:start position:0%
just something that we do um you know
 
01:11:48.430 --> 01:11:48.440 align:start position:0%
that uh different departments have
 
01:11:50.510 --> 01:11:50.520 align:start position:0%
different policies on now and I think
 
01:11:52.990 --> 01:11:53.000 align:start position:0%
that's one of the issues is you have
 
01:11:55.510 --> 01:11:55.520 align:start position:0%
Manchester PD has a policy you have the
 
01:11:57.350 --> 01:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
state police have a policy and and one
 
01:11:58.790 --> 01:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
of the things we learned about those
 
01:12:01.470 --> 01:12:01.480 align:start position:0%
policies too is a lot of those policies
 
01:12:04.669 --> 01:12:04.679 align:start position:0%
were actually put in effect to improve
 
01:12:06.830 --> 01:12:06.840 align:start position:0%
relations with immigrant communities
 
01:12:09.430 --> 01:12:09.440 align:start position:0%
which is really important in cities with
 
01:12:11.470 --> 01:12:11.480 align:start position:0%
larger immigrant populations like
 
01:12:15.669 --> 01:12:15.679 align:start position:0%
Manchester uh and Nashua and so part of
 
01:12:18.149 --> 01:12:18.159 align:start position:0%
the police objection to this was it
 
01:12:21.669 --> 01:12:21.679 align:start position:0%
would actually undo a lot of the good
 
01:12:23.870 --> 01:12:23.880 align:start position:0%
that um that's been done by these
 
01:12:23.880 --> 01:12:25.990 align:start position:0%
that um that's been done by these
policies

01:12:25.990 --> 01:12:26.000 align:start position:0%
policies
 
01:12:29.590 --> 01:12:29.600 align:start position:0%
um yes Senator thank you m thank you Mr
 
01:12:33.910 --> 01:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
chairman u i I speak in support of the
 
01:12:36.270 --> 01:12:36.280 align:start position:0%
iteration that you have just given I'm
 
01:12:38.390 --> 01:12:38.400 align:start position:0%
from Manchester lived in Manchester for
 
01:12:40.189 --> 01:12:40.199 align:start position:0%
the last 60
 
01:12:42.709 --> 01:12:42.719 align:start position:0%
years the west side of Manchester there
 
01:12:46.870 --> 01:12:46.880 align:start position:0%
has been a maximum effort by the City by
 
01:12:50.189 --> 01:12:50.199 align:start position:0%
lower enforcement to bring the community
 
01:12:53.550 --> 01:12:53.560 align:start position:0%
together and to integrate all of these
 
01:12:55.550 --> 01:12:55.560 align:start position:0%
refugees who have come to our City and
 
01:12:57.550 --> 01:12:57.560 align:start position:0%
we've been a placement center for
 
01:12:59.270 --> 01:12:59.280 align:start position:0%
refugees from all from all over the
 
01:13:01.910 --> 01:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
world we we've got the nepes we've got
 
01:13:04.430 --> 01:13:04.440 align:start position:0%
the bosnians we've got the pakistanis we
 
01:13:07.470 --> 01:13:07.480 align:start position:0%
we have a a large group of immigrants
 
01:13:10.950 --> 01:13:10.960 align:start position:0%
and the relationship has been cultivated
 
01:13:13.550 --> 01:13:13.560 align:start position:0%
over a period of time and our law
 
01:13:16.189 --> 01:13:16.199 align:start position:0%
enforcement people are dead set against
 
01:13:20.149 --> 01:13:20.159 align:start position:0%
this piece of legislation our our our
 
01:13:23.310 --> 01:13:23.320 align:start position:0%
our chief of police sent a letter to
 
01:13:25.990 --> 01:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
most members of the letter so
 
01:13:27.790 --> 01:13:27.800 align:start position:0%
I spoke against this bill on the floor
 
01:13:30.669 --> 01:13:30.679 align:start position:0%
of the Senate uh I have great respect
 
01:13:33.390 --> 01:13:33.400 align:start position:0%
for my colleagues and their opinion but
 
01:13:35.669 --> 01:13:35.679 align:start position:0%
my opinion is this will not work it does
 
01:13:39.110 --> 01:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
not work it should not be put in place
 
01:13:41.110 --> 01:13:41.120 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have any bearing at this
 
01:13:42.270 --> 01:13:42.280 align:start position:0%
point in time where the money was
 
01:13:44.629 --> 01:13:44.639 align:start position:0%
spending I was member of the finance
 
01:13:46.510 --> 01:13:46.520 align:start position:0%
committee we allocated the money for the
 
01:13:49.350 --> 01:13:49.360 align:start position:0%
northern border that was to trade
 
01:13:52.430 --> 01:13:52.440 align:start position:0%
people to work the northern
 
01:13:54.830 --> 01:13:54.840 align:start position:0%
border right we did that we've made that
 
01:13:57.149 --> 01:13:57.159 align:start position:0%
we made that commitment I think what
 
01:13:59.430 --> 01:13:59.440 align:start position:0%
people are doing other states is their
 
01:14:01.709 --> 01:14:01.719 align:start position:0%
responsibility they're being run by the
 
01:14:03.870 --> 01:14:03.880 align:start position:0%
politically elected officials in those
 
01:14:06.950 --> 01:14:06.960 align:start position:0%
States if they deem it a responsibility
 
01:14:09.669 --> 01:14:09.679 align:start position:0%
to take care of people then they they do
 
01:14:14.110 --> 01:14:14.120 align:start position:0%
it they're not asking us for help so my
 
01:14:16.510 --> 01:14:16.520 align:start position:0%
position should be very very clear I
 
01:14:19.149 --> 01:14:19.159 align:start position:0%
will support the people in in the city
 
01:14:21.390 --> 01:14:21.400 align:start position:0%
of Manchester immigrants from the city
 
01:14:23.990 --> 01:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
of Manchester came up and testified on
 
01:14:25.590 --> 01:14:25.600 align:start position:0%
this piece of legislation if you read
 
01:14:27.709 --> 01:14:27.719 align:start position:0%
the testimony of the bill I think you
 
01:14:29.590 --> 01:14:29.600 align:start position:0%
could gather you could gather all of
 
01:14:33.229 --> 01:14:33.239 align:start position:0%
that I I think it it's very important
 
01:14:35.310 --> 01:14:35.320 align:start position:0%
that we maintain
 
01:14:37.550 --> 01:14:37.560 align:start position:0%
relationships with the people who have
 
01:14:39.149 --> 01:14:39.159 align:start position:0%
come to our
 
01:14:42.270 --> 01:14:42.280 align:start position:0%
community that have decided to take up
 
01:14:44.669 --> 01:14:44.679 align:start position:0%
residents in our community to build
 
01:14:46.870 --> 01:14:46.880 align:start position:0%
lives in our community to build
 
01:14:49.229 --> 01:14:49.239 align:start position:0%
businesses in our community these people
 
01:14:52.830 --> 01:14:52.840 align:start position:0%
should not be uh singled out and gone
 
01:14:56.229 --> 01:14:56.239 align:start position:0%
after I I I I think it's bad bad public
 
01:14:59.070 --> 01:14:59.080 align:start position:0%
policy I I I would agree that um that
 
01:15:01.149 --> 01:15:01.159 align:start position:0%
would be horrible policy thankfully
 
01:15:02.430 --> 01:15:02.440 align:start position:0%
that's not what this bill does
 
01:15:04.430 --> 01:15:04.440 align:start position:0%
representative uh Senator Bradley uh
 
01:15:07.110 --> 01:15:07.120 align:start position:0%
thank you very much so I
 
01:15:11.910 --> 01:15:11.920 align:start position:0%
I New Hampshire and many other states
 
01:15:15.310 --> 01:15:15.320 align:start position:0%
have the plethora of examples of people
 
01:15:18.110 --> 01:15:18.120 align:start position:0%
in this country illegally that have
 
01:15:21.350 --> 01:15:21.360 align:start position:0%
committed heinous crimes a mass murderer
 
01:15:23.430 --> 01:15:23.440 align:start position:0%
was apprehended in New Hampshire who had
 
01:15:27.510 --> 01:15:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:31.990 --> 01:15:32.000 align:start position:0%
if there wasn't an ice order to detain
 
01:15:34.149 --> 01:15:34.159 align:start position:0%
somebody like that or they were subject
 
01:15:36.510 --> 01:15:36.520 align:start position:0%
to Sanctuary policies that person
 
01:15:38.110 --> 01:15:38.120 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have been apprehended there
 
01:15:40.350 --> 01:15:40.360 align:start position:0%
were just two police officers shot on
 
01:15:43.149 --> 01:15:43.159 align:start position:0%
the street of New York City yesterday or
 
01:15:47.830 --> 01:15:47.840 align:start position:0%
the day before by illegals um so it's
 
01:15:51.590 --> 01:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
example after example after example the
 
01:15:53.950 --> 01:15:53.960 align:start position:0%
poor girl in Georgia who was killed I
 
01:15:55.390 --> 01:15:55.400 align:start position:0%
mean I don't think I need to go any
 
01:15:58.229 --> 01:15:58.239 align:start position:0%
further it's happening in our country
 
01:16:00.189 --> 01:16:00.199 align:start position:0%
and the only reason it's not happening
 
01:16:03.990 --> 01:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
worse in New Hampshire is that they're
 
01:16:07.350 --> 01:16:07.360 align:start position:0%
only a handful of welcoming ordinances
 
01:16:12.390 --> 01:16:12.400 align:start position:0%
in towns like Lebanon and um Hanover and
 
01:16:14.350 --> 01:16:14.360 align:start position:0%
Kean and that's what we're trying to
 
01:16:17.510 --> 01:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
stop we're trying to stop the problems
 
01:16:19.870 --> 01:16:19.880 align:start position:0%
that we see in other states that are out
 
01:16:19.880 --> 01:16:20.790 align:start position:0%
that we see in other states that are out
of

01:16:20.790 --> 01:16:20.800 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:16:24.110 --> 01:16:24.120 align:start position:0%
control from coming here and with all
 
01:16:26.110 --> 01:16:26.120 align:start position:0%
due respect to the the Chiefs the six
 
01:16:28.030 --> 01:16:28.040 align:start position:0%
Chiefs who sign it and nobody's more in
 
01:16:31.070 --> 01:16:31.080 align:start position:0%
support of the Chiefs on a lot of big
 
01:16:33.629 --> 01:16:33.639 align:start position:0%
issues than I am and they know it
 
01:16:35.950 --> 01:16:35.960 align:start position:0%
they're flat out wrong not only
 
01:16:38.070 --> 01:16:38.080 align:start position:0%
misguided but flat out wrong what we're
 
01:16:39.350 --> 01:16:39.360 align:start position:0%
talking about my colleague from
 
01:16:42.229 --> 01:16:42.239 align:start position:0%
Manchester is legal immigrants that are
 
01:16:44.470 --> 01:16:44.480 align:start position:0%
here and the Outreach that goes to Legal
 
01:16:46.350 --> 01:16:46.360 align:start position:0%
immigrants not people that the first
 
01:16:48.310 --> 01:16:48.320 align:start position:0%
thing that they do when they come to the
 
01:16:50.270 --> 01:16:50.280 align:start position:0%
United States of America break their
 
01:16:52.030 --> 01:16:52.040 align:start position:0%
break our laws by crossing a border
 
01:16:54.629 --> 01:16:54.639 align:start position:0%
illegally and if you create a magnet you
 
01:16:57.550 --> 01:16:57.560 align:start position:0%
get magnet and God help us you know a
 
01:16:59.470 --> 01:16:59.480 align:start position:0%
billion dollars in Massachusetts is
 
01:17:02.390 --> 01:17:02.400 align:start position:0%
something that is out of control and our
 
01:17:05.070 --> 01:17:05.080 align:start position:0%
budget given you know education funding
 
01:17:06.590 --> 01:17:06.600 align:start position:0%
that we're going to have to deal with
 
01:17:10.390 --> 01:17:10.400 align:start position:0%
next year all in all likelihood the YDC
 
01:17:12.550 --> 01:17:12.560 align:start position:0%
settlements you know what we just
 
01:17:13.990 --> 01:17:14.000 align:start position:0%
authorized and it's on its way to the
 
01:17:16.430 --> 01:17:16.440 align:start position:0%
governor on group two fix if if we have
 
01:17:19.390 --> 01:17:19.400 align:start position:0%
to spend hundreds of millions of
 
01:17:21.990 --> 01:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
dollars because we've created a magnet
 
01:17:23.629 --> 01:17:23.639 align:start position:0%
because we can't pass this bill because
 
01:17:25.430 --> 01:17:25.440 align:start position:0%
we don't have a political where with all
 
01:17:29.229 --> 01:17:29.239 align:start position:0%
to pass a common sense Bill to say we're
 
01:17:33.790 --> 01:17:33.800 align:start position:0%
not going to be an incentive shame on
 
01:17:36.910 --> 01:17:36.920 align:start position:0%
us um I think that it's important that
 
01:17:38.270 --> 01:17:38.280 align:start position:0%
we make the distinction because
 
01:17:42.990 --> 01:17:43.000 align:start position:0%
oftentimes it's not made nobody in this
 
01:17:46.310 --> 01:17:46.320 align:start position:0%
um body or your body is interested in
 
01:17:48.870 --> 01:17:48.880 align:start position:0%
harassing or in any way singling out
 
01:17:51.149 --> 01:17:51.159 align:start position:0%
legal immigrants to this country and
 
01:17:53.990 --> 01:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
them constantly being tied together by
 
01:17:56.470 --> 01:17:56.480 align:start position:0%
someone saying well immigrants rights
 
01:17:58.189 --> 01:17:58.199 align:start position:0%
groups we're not talking about
 
01:18:00.070 --> 01:18:00.080 align:start position:0%
immigrants we're talking about criminals
 
01:18:02.350 --> 01:18:02.360 align:start position:0%
who have illegally come to the country
 
01:18:04.030 --> 01:18:04.040 align:start position:0%
and really I'm not even interested in
 
01:18:05.910 --> 01:18:05.920 align:start position:0%
the Hampshire police policing them as
 
01:18:07.229 --> 01:18:07.239 align:start position:0%
far as I'm concerned that's a federal
 
01:18:10.229 --> 01:18:10.239 align:start position:0%
problem but when our law enforcement
 
01:18:12.110 --> 01:18:12.120 align:start position:0%
arrest them for violation of New
 
01:18:14.669 --> 01:18:14.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law and they become aware of a
 
01:18:17.709 --> 01:18:17.719 align:start position:0%
federal issue I do not think as a policy
 
01:18:19.270 --> 01:18:19.280 align:start position:0%
we should be picking and choosing when
 
01:18:21.590 --> 01:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
we cooperate with the federal government
 
01:18:24.870 --> 01:18:24.880 align:start position:0%
um it it's not good um I think that our
 
01:18:26.350 --> 01:18:26.360 align:start position:0%
friends on the other side would object
 
01:18:28.590 --> 01:18:28.600 align:start position:0%
if we were to say you shall not
 
01:18:30.390 --> 01:18:30.400 align:start position:0%
cooperate with the federal government on
 
01:18:32.189 --> 01:18:32.199 align:start position:0%
some other things they happen alike I
 
01:18:33.870 --> 01:18:33.880 align:start position:0%
think a blanket policy of the state
 
01:18:35.870 --> 01:18:35.880 align:start position:0%
should be we cooperate with the federal
 
01:18:37.229 --> 01:18:37.239 align:start position:0%
government it doesn't matter who the
 
01:18:39.750 --> 01:18:39.760 align:start position:0%
president is whether we like him or not
 
01:18:42.189 --> 01:18:42.199 align:start position:0%
um because it changes every four years
 
01:18:43.629 --> 01:18:43.639 align:start position:0%
and I'd also like to point out the
 
01:18:46.550 --> 01:18:46.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is a state it's not a republic
 
01:18:48.709 --> 01:18:48.719 align:start position:0%
the cities and towns do not get to do
 
01:18:51.470 --> 01:18:51.480 align:start position:0%
what they want um they weren't um they
 
01:18:53.629 --> 01:18:53.639 align:start position:0%
didn't vote to join New Hampshire um
 
01:18:54.870 --> 01:18:54.880 align:start position:0%
they were within the borders when New
 
01:18:57.110 --> 01:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire was formed so they follow the
 
01:18:58.590 --> 01:18:58.600 align:start position:0%
laws of New Hampshire they don't get to
 
01:19:01.390 --> 01:19:01.400 align:start position:0%
just pick and choose either so I I agree
 
01:19:05.390 --> 01:19:05.400 align:start position:0%
that a policy that says as a state we
 
01:19:07.790 --> 01:19:07.800 align:start position:0%
will cooperate with our federal Partners
 
01:19:09.750 --> 01:19:09.760 align:start position:0%
um and that goes for everything I mean
 
01:19:11.750 --> 01:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
some may say well that's hypocritical
 
01:19:14.030 --> 01:19:14.040 align:start position:0%
well not of me because I just supported
 
01:19:15.149 --> 01:19:15.159 align:start position:0%
uh cooperating with the federal
 
01:19:17.310 --> 01:19:17.320 align:start position:0%
government on gun control so as far as
 
01:19:19.830 --> 01:19:19.840 align:start position:0%
I'm turn across the board we should be
 
01:19:21.510 --> 01:19:21.520 align:start position:0%
cooperating with federal law enforcement
 
01:19:24.390 --> 01:19:24.400 align:start position:0%
where wherever possible um having said
 
01:19:25.590 --> 01:19:25.600 align:start position:0%
that it appears to me that we're not
 
01:19:27.629 --> 01:19:27.639 align:start position:0%
going to come to an agreement um at this
 
01:19:31.470 --> 01:19:31.480 align:start position:0%
table at this moment um I speaking as
 
01:19:33.669 --> 01:19:33.679 align:start position:0%
the chair and I know two of my members
 
01:19:37.709 --> 01:19:37.719 align:start position:0%
will support um going to the amended
 
01:19:40.110 --> 01:19:40.120 align:start position:0%
version that the house voted on already
 
01:19:42.470 --> 01:19:42.480 align:start position:0%
and if we need to what we'll do is we'll
 
01:19:44.590 --> 01:19:44.600 align:start position:0%
take a recess um we can meet again
 
01:19:45.790 --> 01:19:45.800 align:start position:0%
tomorrow same time as the other
 
01:19:48.790 --> 01:19:48.800 align:start position:0%
committee maybe half an hour later and
 
01:19:51.629 --> 01:19:51.639 align:start position:0%
come up with that version and approve it
 
01:19:54.070 --> 01:19:54.080 align:start position:0%
uh yeah if I could make a suggestion
 
01:19:59.070 --> 01:19:59.080 align:start position:0%
just that your version yeah and um we'll
 
01:20:02.790 --> 01:20:02.800 align:start position:0%
see where we at tomorrow and um go from
 
01:20:04.790 --> 01:20:04.800 align:start position:0%

um we are here to address um some
 
02:06:38.709 --> 02:06:38.719 align:start position:0%
changes from the standpoint of the two
 
02:06:40.750 --> 02:06:40.760 align:start position:0%
bills there's three three things
 
02:06:42.950 --> 02:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
attached to this bill the criminal
 
02:06:44.350 --> 02:06:44.360 align:start position:0%
justice part with regard to the
 
02:06:47.669 --> 02:06:47.679 align:start position:0%

and stuff we're fine with that that's
 
02:06:50.669 --> 02:06:50.679 align:start position:0%
good that's not even an issue for today
 
02:06:52.030 --> 02:06:52.040 align:start position:0%
as far as I'm concerned
 
02:06:53.990 --> 02:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
the piece with regard to fishing game
 
02:06:56.270 --> 02:06:56.280 align:start position:0%
the same the last piece that we need to
 
02:06:57.390 --> 02:06:57.400 align:start position:0%
discuss I'm going to hand over to
 
02:06:59.669 --> 02:06:59.679 align:start position:0%
representative hunt um and let him take
 
02:07:02.430 --> 02:07:02.440 align:start position:0%
it and we'll we'll get into that
 
02:07:06.669 --> 02:07:06.679 align:start position:0%
representative hunt okay so um this was
 
02:07:10.990 --> 02:07:11.000 align:start position:0%
the uh inter I was we making sure I say
 
02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:13.109 align:start position:0%
the uh inter I was we making sure I say
this

02:07:13.109 --> 02:07:13.119 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:07:17.510 --> 02:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
inter inter uterin uterine
 
02:07:21.830 --> 02:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
insemination so um originally the the
 
02:07:24.310 --> 02:07:24.320 align:start position:0%
commerce subcommittee was all set to
 
02:07:26.830 --> 02:07:26.840 align:start position:0%
interim study this
 
02:07:31.030 --> 02:07:31.040 align:start position:0%
bill and then uh there was at the last
 
02:07:33.830 --> 02:07:33.840 align:start position:0%
moment on our day of executing there was
 
02:07:36.910 --> 02:07:36.920 align:start position:0%
a little uh you know uncomfort with
 
02:07:41.750 --> 02:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
where what we were doing and and the way
 
02:07:44.629 --> 02:07:44.639 align:start position:0%
the bill was written it was basically
 
02:07:49.310 --> 02:07:49.320 align:start position:0%
written to that to say that any any any
 
02:07:53.189 --> 02:07:53.199 align:start position:0%
woman could have this procedure done
 
02:07:55.310 --> 02:07:55.320 align:start position:0%
okay even though this intent the
 
02:07:59.350 --> 02:07:59.360 align:start position:0%
underlying intention was uh to address
 
02:08:01.830 --> 02:08:01.840 align:start position:0%
uh an expression we
 
02:08:04.350 --> 02:08:04.360 align:start position:0%
learned previous
 
02:08:07.189 --> 02:08:07.199 align:start position:0%
year um which is
 
02:08:07.199 --> 02:08:09.910 align:start position:0%
year um which is
social

02:08:09.910 --> 02:08:09.920 align:start position:0%
social
 
02:08:11.910 --> 02:08:11.920 align:start position:0%
infertility um which the Commerce
 
02:08:14.470 --> 02:08:14.480 align:start position:0%
Committee did not go anywhere with
 
02:08:17.030 --> 02:08:17.040 align:start position:0%
that um
 
02:08:23.030 --> 02:08:23.040 align:start position:0%
so in in the in My ATT to uh maintain
 
02:08:24.390 --> 02:08:24.400 align:start position:0%
that that the Commerce Committee was
 
02:08:26.709 --> 02:08:26.719 align:start position:0%
going to have any floor fights we were
 
02:08:30.430 --> 02:08:30.440 align:start position:0%
going to do everything in uh in harmony
 
02:08:32.790 --> 02:08:32.800 align:start position:0%
um I said let's uh move from interim
 
02:08:34.830 --> 02:08:34.840 align:start position:0%
study and let's uh have an amendment
 
02:08:37.790 --> 02:08:37.800 align:start position:0%
I'll draw up an amendment that would
 
02:08:39.109 --> 02:08:39.119 align:start position:0%
address the
 
02:08:43.589 --> 02:08:43.599 align:start position:0%
issue and um and the amendment I drew up
 
02:08:45.790 --> 02:08:45.800 align:start position:0%
the amendment uh and I actually believe
 
02:08:47.910 --> 02:08:47.920 align:start position:0%
you the Senate also Drew up the
 
02:08:50.669 --> 02:08:50.679 align:start position:0%
amendment because then when I looked on
 
02:08:54.270 --> 02:08:54.280 align:start position:0%
the the web page page you had two 20 and
 
02:08:57.830 --> 02:08:57.840 align:start position:0%
21 so uh you chose instead to go with
 
02:09:01.109 --> 02:09:01.119 align:start position:0%
the one that I specifically would not go
 
02:09:04.430 --> 02:09:04.440 align:start position:0%
for and made it clear to everyone that I
 
02:09:09.069 --> 02:09:09.079 align:start position:0%
do not consider this procedure a medical
 
02:09:11.109 --> 02:09:11.119 align:start position:0%
necessity if we're if we're saying this
 
02:09:14.109 --> 02:09:14.119 align:start position:0%
is offered to all women this is this is
 
02:09:17.229 --> 02:09:17.239 align:start position:0%
a a benefit that that all women have
 
02:09:19.629 --> 02:09:19.639 align:start position:0%
that that for whatever reason that that
 
02:09:21.430 --> 02:09:21.440 align:start position:0%
this is the where they choose to get
 
02:09:25.350 --> 02:09:25.360 align:start position:0%
pregnant then then um but it's not a
 
02:09:27.669 --> 02:09:27.679 align:start position:0%
medical necessity it is just simply that
 
02:09:29.669 --> 02:09:29.679 align:start position:0%
with the insurance company will cover it
 
02:09:31.310 --> 02:09:31.320 align:start position:0%
and it really in in the end of the day
 
02:09:32.790 --> 02:09:32.800 align:start position:0%
it's not going to be a big burden to the
 
02:09:35.229 --> 02:09:35.239 align:start position:0%
insurance company because um you has
 
02:09:37.470 --> 02:09:37.480 align:start position:0%
still has all the same cost sharing
 
02:09:42.750 --> 02:09:42.760 align:start position:0%
pieces to it and uh and the matter there
 
02:09:45.430 --> 02:09:45.440 align:start position:0%
and when it comes to
 
02:09:48.830 --> 02:09:48.840 align:start position:0%
um getting getting uh getting fully
 
02:09:50.629 --> 02:09:50.639 align:start position:0%
fertilized for all the all the other
 
02:09:52.310 --> 02:09:52.320 align:start position:0%
things involved there are a lot more
 
02:09:54.549 --> 02:09:54.559 align:start position:0%
expensive elements to it and this is
 
02:09:57.750 --> 02:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
actually one of the smallest expense of
 
02:10:00.430 --> 02:10:00.440 align:start position:0%
all and so therefore at that point I you
 
02:10:02.350 --> 02:10:02.360 align:start position:0%
know said okay that's fine and but we're
 
02:10:04.830 --> 02:10:04.840 align:start position:0%
not we're not specifically targeting
 
02:10:07.149 --> 02:10:07.159 align:start position:0%
this to one group of people we're saying
 
02:10:08.750 --> 02:10:08.760 align:start position:0%
that all women should have this
 
02:10:11.149 --> 02:10:11.159 align:start position:0%
possibility so if you just remove the
 
02:10:14.109 --> 02:10:14.119 align:start position:0%
medical necessity language then I I'll
 
02:10:17.350 --> 02:10:17.360 align:start position:0%
be okay with it so just if I may for for
 
02:10:19.270 --> 02:10:19.280 align:start position:0%
those of us who don't know anything
 
02:10:21.430 --> 02:10:21.440 align:start position:0%
about this because it's not our bill um
 
02:10:23.149 --> 02:10:23.159 align:start position:0%
um the
 
02:10:27.069 --> 02:10:27.079 align:start position:0%
agreement both sides agree that this
 
02:10:29.470 --> 02:10:29.480 align:start position:0%
procedure should be provided for and
 
02:10:32.030 --> 02:10:32.040 align:start position:0%
paid for by Insurance the the
 
02:10:34.669 --> 02:10:34.679 align:start position:0%
disagreement is on a description is that
 
02:10:36.629 --> 02:10:36.639 align:start position:0%
really that's that's all it is at this
 
02:10:39.870 --> 02:10:39.880 align:start position:0%
point is that fair that's how it sounds
 
02:10:43.589 --> 02:10:43.599 align:start position:0%
to me um I don't know picking me up so
 
02:10:46.390 --> 02:10:46.400 align:start position:0%
chairman hunt um I
 
02:10:49.109 --> 02:10:49.119 align:start position:0%
think as you'll remember on that session
 
02:10:50.750 --> 02:10:50.760 align:start position:0%
day there was lots of things flying
 
02:10:51.950 --> 02:10:51.960 align:start position:0%
around so
 
02:10:54.709 --> 02:10:54.719 align:start position:0%
what you're saying is um if I'm looking
 
02:10:58.149 --> 02:10:58.159 align:start position:0%
at HB 1197 as amended by the
 
02:11:01.950 --> 02:11:01.960 align:start position:0%
Senate um I believe our language appears
 
02:11:04.510 --> 02:11:04.520 align:start position:0%
on lines 25
 
02:11:04.520 --> 02:11:06.790 align:start position:0%
on lines 25
through

02:11:06.790 --> 02:11:06.800 align:start position:0%
through
 
02:11:10.270 --> 02:11:10.280 align:start position:0%
35 well yeah 20 I see 26 yeah new
 
02:11:10.280 --> 02:11:12.149 align:start position:0%
35 well yeah 20 I see 26 yeah new
section

02:11:12.149 --> 02:11:12.159 align:start position:0%
section
 
02:11:15.069 --> 02:11:15.079 align:start position:0%
yep so I'm looking on page 36 on the
 
02:11:18.669 --> 02:11:18.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:22.830 --> 02:11:22.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:24.790 --> 02:11:24.800 align:start position:0%
um and
 
02:11:28.629 --> 02:11:28.639 align:start position:0%
so which language specifically would you
 
02:11:32.189 --> 02:11:32.199 align:start position:0%
like to I would I believe
 
02:11:35.390 --> 02:11:35.400 align:start position:0%
um is
 
02:11:38.669 --> 02:11:38.679 align:start position:0%
um shall provide certific hold Insurance
 
02:11:41.430 --> 02:11:41.440 align:start position:0%
up to six round inconvenience
 
02:11:46.910 --> 02:11:46.920 align:start position:0%
insemination per year per year
 
02:11:49.589 --> 02:11:49.599 align:start position:0%
period so you see the word six the next
 
02:11:51.790 --> 02:11:51.800 align:start position:0%
line says in insemination
 
02:11:55.030 --> 02:11:55.040 align:start position:0%
year so that in accordance with that
 
02:11:57.229 --> 02:11:57.239 align:start position:0%
that all that language is is what I
 
02:12:00.390 --> 02:12:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:03.589 --> 02:12:03.599 align:start position:0%
deleted standard or guidelines developed
 
02:12:05.990 --> 02:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
by theic
 
02:12:10.910 --> 02:12:10.920 align:start position:0%
soci so I'm C I'm sorry I'm curious to
 
02:12:14.549 --> 02:12:14.559 align:start position:0%
know I don't the way I just read that
 
02:12:16.790 --> 02:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
it's not saying it's medically necessary
 
02:12:19.950 --> 02:12:19.960 align:start position:0%
but it it's it's medically necessary for
 
02:12:21.189 --> 02:12:21.199 align:start position:0%
them to get pregnant but it's not
 
02:12:23.510 --> 02:12:23.520 align:start position:0%
medically necessary for people to have
 
02:12:26.549 --> 02:12:26.559 align:start position:0%
is that is that correct right okay so is
 
02:12:28.149 --> 02:12:28.159 align:start position:0%
that what your language intended that it
 
02:12:30.109 --> 02:12:30.119 align:start position:0%
seems to me we're just talking past each
 
02:12:33.069 --> 02:12:33.079 align:start position:0%
other maybe yeah I I tend to agree
 
02:12:35.589 --> 02:12:35.599 align:start position:0%
representative I think that this
 
02:12:40.030 --> 02:12:40.040 align:start position:0%
language was added um with the intent of
 
02:12:41.669 --> 02:12:41.679 align:start position:0%
trying to make sure everyone felt
 
02:12:44.390 --> 02:12:44.400 align:start position:0%
comfortable with how this mandate was
 
02:12:47.229 --> 02:12:47.239 align:start position:0%
going to come into effect but um
 
02:12:48.870 --> 02:12:48.880 align:start position:0%
removing the language you're talking
 
02:12:52.950 --> 02:12:52.960 align:start position:0%
about um chairman after per plan per
 
02:12:56.470 --> 02:12:56.480 align:start position:0%
year per plan year to me um doesn't
 
02:12:58.189 --> 02:12:58.199 align:start position:0%
affect the coverage that anyone would
 
02:13:01.270 --> 02:13:01.280 align:start position:0%
get and if it um if it's sort of
 
02:13:03.750 --> 02:13:03.760 align:start position:0%
muddying waters that were previously
 
02:13:06.069 --> 02:13:06.079 align:start position:0%
clear personally I'm fine with removing
 
02:13:08.950 --> 02:13:08.960 align:start position:0%
it okay yeah then and then the last
 
02:13:11.189 --> 02:13:11.199 align:start position:0%
sentence subject to a deductible C code
 
02:13:14.430 --> 02:13:14.440 align:start position:0%
insurance would be kept so it's just
 
02:13:16.470 --> 02:13:16.480 align:start position:0%
okay it's just a medical
 
02:13:19.189 --> 02:13:19.199 align:start position:0%
necessity and all those other people who
 
02:13:21.390 --> 02:13:21.400 align:start position:0%
I have no idea who they are well I guess
 
02:13:25.030 --> 02:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
they're important people so from um line
 
02:13:30.709 --> 02:13:30.719 align:start position:0%
28 on page 11 uh where it starts in to
 
02:13:34.109 --> 02:13:34.119 align:start position:0%
technology comma is
 
02:13:34.119 --> 02:13:35.669 align:start position:0%
technology comma is
removed

02:13:35.669 --> 02:13:35.679 align:start position:0%
removed
 
02:13:39.270 --> 02:13:39.280 align:start position:0%
uh right so it starts with
 
02:13:39.280 --> 02:13:42.430 align:start position:0%
uh right so it starts with
yeah

02:13:42.430 --> 02:13:42.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:46.629 --> 02:13:46.639 align:start position:0%
if right so it starts with per
 
02:13:50.109 --> 02:13:50.119 align:start position:0%
year per year and subject to deductible
 
02:13:53.790 --> 02:13:53.800 align:start position:0%
coped right if Senator Perkins PO is
 
02:13:56.870 --> 02:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
good with it so do other Comer have
 
02:13:58.790 --> 02:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
anything want to have that's good to me
 
02:14:01.430 --> 02:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
good to you don't know I'm
 
02:14:01.440 --> 02:14:03.669 align:start position:0%

02:14:11.270 --> 02:14:11.280 align:start position:0%
that on the house floor or do you think
 
02:14:13.069 --> 02:14:13.079 align:start position:0%
that'll be an acceptable position I
 
02:14:14.069 --> 02:14:14.079 align:start position:0%
think that's
 
02:14:21.270 --> 02:14:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:25.109 --> 02:14:25.119 align:start position:0%
