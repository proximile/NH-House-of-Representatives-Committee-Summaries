problem CU he said he he said he was
 
00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:57.440 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:00.479 align:start position:0%
here the other person that we need yeah
 
00:06:05.469 --> 00:06:05.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:08.629 --> 00:06:08.639 align:start position:0%
yes making a dramatic entrance
 
00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:10.110 align:start position:0%
yes making a dramatic entrance
representative

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:10.120 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:06:16.589 --> 00:06:16.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:18.880 align:start position:0%
right all right we
 
00:06:23.309 --> 00:06:23.319 align:start position:0%
have uh 10 bills to exec today only one
 
00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:25.120 align:start position:0%
was noticed because I was hoping we'd
 
00:06:27.749 --> 00:06:27.759 align:start position:0%
get a few of the others taken care of
 
00:06:30.909 --> 00:06:30.919 align:start position:0%
last week but the uh hearing ran over a
 
00:06:30.919 --> 00:06:35.990 align:start position:0%
last week but the uh hearing ran over a
bit

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:38.840 align:start position:0%
so the uh first one I'd like to do is a
 
00:06:41.589 --> 00:06:41.599 align:start position:0%
warmup is C
 
00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:56.469 --> 00:06:56.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:56.479 --> 00:06:58.510 align:start position:0%
 
R1

00:06:58.510 --> 00:06:58.520 align:start position:0%
R1
 
00:07:01.309 --> 00:07:01.319 align:start position:0%
okay representative Bailey moves in
 
00:07:03.869 --> 00:07:03.879 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate representative
 
00:07:05.749 --> 00:07:05.759 align:start position:0%
Schmidt seconds do you wish to speak to
 
00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:12.120 align:start position:0%
Bailey no I think
 
00:07:15.869 --> 00:07:15.879 align:start position:0%
it okay representative Schmidt well I
 
00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:22.400 align:start position:0%
want I appreciate the motion of itl
 
00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:25.000 align:start position:0%
which is I a motion I was prepared to
 
00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:28.240 align:start position:0%
make and uh for those who are new to the
 
00:07:31.629 --> 00:07:31.639 align:start position:0%
committee this term this is a a bill
 
00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:34.800 align:start position:0%
that we have seen in itl previously at
 
00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:40.240 align:start position:0%
least twice um and uh while I understand
 
00:07:42.909 --> 00:07:42.919 align:start position:0%
the the sponsors motivations and so
 
00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:44.960 align:start position:0%
forth the bottom line is I think that
 
00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:47.960 align:start position:0%
the bill as written is not viable not
 
00:07:50.909 --> 00:07:50.919 align:start position:0%
workable uh but that that we have a
 
00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:54.360 align:start position:0%
situation in the state where we have a
 
00:07:57.710 --> 00:07:57.720 align:start position:0%
structure in place to handle potential
 
00:08:00.469 --> 00:08:00.479 align:start position:0%
incapacitations or deaths of the
 
00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
governor that has worked for over 200
 
00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:06.560 align:start position:0%
years and we've had exactly one example
 
00:08:10.149 --> 00:08:10.159 align:start position:0%
of a another Governor dying in office I
 
00:08:13.029 --> 00:08:13.039 align:start position:0%
and I think that the uh the system that
 
00:08:15.189 --> 00:08:15.199 align:start position:0%
we have works admirably well and I
 
00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:17.720 align:start position:0%
appreciate the itl motion by the maker
 
00:08:21.749 --> 00:08:21.759 align:start position:0%
thereof thank you anyone else have a
 
00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:24.280 align:start position:0%
comment I'd like to say that our
 
00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:26.440 align:start position:0%
tradition of electing the governor every
 
00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:30.520 align:start position:0%
two years means that we're not stuck
 
00:08:33.909 --> 00:08:33.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:36.709 --> 00:08:36.719 align:start position:0%
or um incompetent Governor well not
 
00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
incompetent excuse me that's the wrong
 
00:08:42.430 --> 00:08:42.440 align:start position:0%
word uh incapacitated incapacitated
 
00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:44.760 align:start position:0%
thank you that's a better word governor
 
00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:47.120 align:start position:0%
for very long it's not that like the
 
00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:48.920 align:start position:0%
places where the governor serves for
 
00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:53.920 align:start position:0%
four or six years um it's it's a short
 
00:08:57.389 --> 00:08:57.399 align:start position:0%
period of time and I think our our
 
00:08:59.910 --> 00:08:59.920 align:start position:0%
constitutional protections are are quite
 
00:09:02.269 --> 00:09:02.279 align:start position:0%
solid or anyone
 
00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:05.240 align:start position:0%
else representative sloty were going to
 
00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:07.269 align:start position:0%
else representative sloty were going to
say

00:09:07.269 --> 00:09:07.279 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
something you were going to say
 
00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:13.560 align:start position:0%
something no I'm I'm all set thank you
 
00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:16.640 align:start position:0%
okay anyone else have a comment
 
00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:18.880 align:start position:0%
question okay then the motion is
 
00:09:22.509 --> 00:09:22.519 align:start position:0%

00:09:24.389 --> 00:09:24.399 align:start position:0%

96 is which one is
 
00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:54.920 align:start position:0%
that what's it the energy code oh energy
 
00:11:00.269 --> 00:11:00.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:02.269 --> 00:11:02.279 align:start position:0%
represent groa did you have a
 
00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:05.480 align:start position:0%
motion no I guess
 
00:11:09.069 --> 00:11:09.079 align:start position:0%
not all right uh since representative
 
00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:12.360 align:start position:0%
shien can't be here I'll move
 
00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:14.600 align:start position:0%
itl a
 
00:11:17.509 --> 00:11:17.519 align:start position:0%
second okay
 
00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to say that the
 
00:11:25.389 --> 00:11:25.399 align:start position:0%
subcommittee met on that and going to
 
00:11:25.399 --> 00:11:26.509 align:start position:0%
subcommittee met on that and going to
the

00:11:26.509 --> 00:11:26.519 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:30.720 align:start position:0%
2021 energy code while the building code
 
00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:35.240 align:start position:0%
review board is working on reviewing the
 
00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:37.750 align:start position:0%
review board is working on reviewing the
2024

00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:37.760 align:start position:0%
2024
 
00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:40.550 align:start position:0%
2024
code

00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
code
 
00:11:42.829 --> 00:11:42.839 align:start position:0%
seems like a waste of effort on
 
00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
everybody's part and from what I have
 
00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:50.800 align:start position:0%
heard the 2024 code fixes a great many
 
00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:53.600 align:start position:0%
errors oh not errors problems with the
 
00:11:57.670 --> 00:11:57.680 align:start position:0%
21 code so it is a more effective code
 
00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:02.360 align:start position:0%
in in the first place so I the 21 code
 
00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:06.680 align:start position:0%
was considered and rejected by both the
 
00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
building code review board and the
 
00:12:14.389 --> 00:12:14.399 align:start position:0%
legislature last year and I think going
 
00:12:17.269 --> 00:12:17.279 align:start position:0%
back to trying adopted on an interim
 
00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:20.560 align:start position:0%
level is a waste of time uh
 
00:12:22.629 --> 00:12:22.639 align:start position:0%
representative L uh thank you madam
 
00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:26.720 align:start position:0%
chair um if the 2021 building uh energy
 
00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:28.720 align:start position:0%
code was all we had to look at right now
 
00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:30.040 align:start position:0%
that would be one thing but there's the
 
00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:32.320 align:start position:0%
2024 energy code that's already being
 
00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
reviewed you know let's let's keep
 
00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
working and looking forward instead of
 
00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:37.680 align:start position:0%
trying to look backwards when we have
 
00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
another version that's already being
 
00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:41.880 align:start position:0%
reviewed so that's why I'm voting itl
 
00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:44.600 align:start position:0%
okay is there any anyone else represent
 
00:12:47.629 --> 00:12:47.639 align:start position:0%
long uh so I want to say that I like the
 
00:12:50.189 --> 00:12:50.199 align:start position:0%
concept of this bill but my constituents
 
00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:52.240 align:start position:0%
are very concerned about the cost of
 
00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
housing uh especially right now so I
 
00:12:57.310 --> 00:12:57.320 align:start position:0%
don't think it's the right time for it
 
00:12:59.470 --> 00:12:59.480 align:start position:0%
uh I would vote for this bill at the
 
00:13:03.310 --> 00:13:03.320 align:start position:0%
right time uh but I'm not going to today
 
00:13:04.670 --> 00:13:04.680 align:start position:0%
I'll be voting for the
 
00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:08.920 align:start position:0%
itl uh I also I feel like the numbers
 
00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:11.240 align:start position:0%
that were supported or were offered by
 
00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:12.720 align:start position:0%
both sides were not really supported
 
00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:14.720 align:start position:0%
sufficiently so I would like to see more
 
00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:17.480 align:start position:0%
information next time the bill comes
 
00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:19.120 align:start position:0%
around all right thank you
 
00:13:21.269 --> 00:13:21.279 align:start position:0%
representative scitech if I may follow
 
00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:23.360 align:start position:0%
up on representative long because I was
 
00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:25.800 align:start position:0%
struck by the same point I heard at one
 
00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
point 29,000 I heard at another Point
 
00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:31.560 align:start position:0%
2,000 if it were really 2000 we would be
 
00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:34.040 align:start position:0%
this would be on consent calendar so
 
00:13:37.829 --> 00:13:37.839 align:start position:0%
it's I'd really like to see
 
00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:42.320 align:start position:0%
more more data uh and that's that thank
 
00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:44.360 align:start position:0%
you okay representative
 
00:13:48.069 --> 00:13:48.079 align:start position:0%
re yeah I'll be voting against uh itl
 
00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:50.720 align:start position:0%
today because I'm concerned that being
 
00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:53.920 align:start position:0%
so far behind um the standard is going
 
00:13:56.629 --> 00:13:56.639 align:start position:0%
to cost New Hampshire some money so um
 
00:13:59.670 --> 00:13:59.680 align:start position:0%
if we don't get our uh energy code up to
 
00:14:02.590 --> 00:14:02.600 align:start position:0%
date we miss the opportunity to unlock
 
00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:05.160 align:start position:0%
Federal funding for New Hampshire so our
 
00:14:08.629 --> 00:14:08.639 align:start position:0%
state's building codes are not aligned
 
00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
um which could mean that we would not be
 
00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:13.160 align:start position:0%
eligible for significant Federal funding
 
00:14:15.069 --> 00:14:15.079 align:start position:0%
opportunities including grants from the
 
00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
inflation reduction act infrastructure
 
00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:18.600 align:start position:0%
investment and jobs Act and the
 
00:14:21.629 --> 00:14:21.639 align:start position:0%
department of energy programs um this
 
00:14:23.629 --> 00:14:23.639 align:start position:0%
bill would reduce energy costs for
 
00:14:24.949 --> 00:14:24.959 align:start position:0%
residents and
 
00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:28.880 align:start position:0%
businesses uh it enhances our ability to
 
00:14:30.990 --> 00:14:31.000 align:start position:0%
um or rather helps us to strengthen
 
00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:33.880 align:start position:0%
climate resilience um and would help the
 
00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:36.320 align:start position:0%
construction industry and job market so
 
00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:38.800 align:start position:0%
because we heard two different sets of
 
00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:41.360 align:start position:0%
data um I'm not sure that the higher
 
00:14:44.269 --> 00:14:44.279 align:start position:0%
number being offered by a lobbying uh
 
00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:46.440 align:start position:0%
entity is something that we should be
 
00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:48.600 align:start position:0%
relying upon so I'm going to vote
 
00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:49.590 align:start position:0%
relying upon so I'm going to vote
against

00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:49.600 align:start position:0%
against
 
00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:52.480 align:start position:0%
itl thank you representative scitech
 
00:14:54.790 --> 00:14:54.800 align:start position:0%
wasn't that higher number rep that was
 
00:14:58.069 --> 00:14:58.079 align:start position:0%
offered by a lobbyist did that a
 
00:15:00.670 --> 00:15:00.680 align:start position:0%
lobbyist say that came from uh Senator
 
00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:03.240 align:start position:0%
sh uh
 
00:15:06.269 --> 00:15:06.279 align:start position:0%
Shaheen that's what I thought I heard
 
00:15:10.990 --> 00:15:11.000 align:start position:0%
yeah in any event the the testimony was
 
00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:15.680 align:start position:0%
that imposing this code would create a
 
00:15:18.829 --> 00:15:18.839 align:start position:0%
an increas in cost of building and there
 
00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:21.480 align:start position:0%
were debates over how much but it was
 
00:15:24.069 --> 00:15:24.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:27.150 --> 00:15:27.160 align:start position:0%
increase anyone else representative
 
00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:30.440 align:start position:0%
groda thank you
 
00:15:33.389 --> 00:15:33.399 align:start position:0%
I'll support the itl but not because I
 
00:15:35.629 --> 00:15:35.639 align:start position:0%
don't like the policy about this bill
 
00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
because I think that it's important to
 
00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:40.680 align:start position:0%
consider however I'm uncomfortable with
 
00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:43.680 align:start position:0%
the back and forth between the different
 
00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:46.680 align:start position:0%
testimonies that we had and I'm also
 
00:15:50.269 --> 00:15:50.279 align:start position:0%
concerned about mandating something
 
00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:53.800 align:start position:0%
that we don't as a committee have the
 
00:15:59.069 --> 00:15:59.079 align:start position:0%
expertise to understand so I can I know
 
00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:00.720 align:start position:0%
this bill will come
 
00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
back and um I plan on learning more
 
00:16:08.389 --> 00:16:08.399 align:start position:0%
about the costs of Energy Efficiency in
 
00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
homes and I would encourage other
 
00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:12.880 align:start position:0%
members of the committee to do it to do
 
00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:17.920 align:start position:0%
this as well thank you anyone
 
00:16:21.309 --> 00:16:21.319 align:start position:0%

00:18:06.909 --> 00:18:06.919 align:start position:0%
with Mr uh Gage and Mr D re if I've got
 
00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:10.600 align:start position:0%

00:18:23.470 --> 00:18:23.480 align:start position:0%
um as a side note I want to mention to
 
00:18:25.549 --> 00:18:25.559 align:start position:0%
Representatives Howard and Leon that
 
00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:28.200 align:start position:0%
they still owe committee reports from
 
00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:29.360 align:start position:0%
last week
 
00:18:32.630 --> 00:18:32.640 align:start position:0%
so at your for House Bill 210 the commi
 
00:18:35.310 --> 00:18:35.320 align:start position:0%

second committee bills so I am not going
 
00:19:05.029 --> 00:19:05.039 align:start position:0%

week good job guys and uh we'll see what
 
00:19:10.630 --> 00:19:10.640 align:start position:0%

00:19:23.470 --> 00:19:23.480 align:start position:0%
week's calendar if we can get them in
 
00:19:26.950 --> 00:19:26.960 align:start position:0%

representative L uh yes I move itl on
 
00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:38.320 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:40.840 align:start position:0%
161 I'll
 
00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:43.120 align:start position:0%
second okay do you wish to speak to your
 
00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:46.320 align:start position:0%
motion uh yes thank you madam chair um I
 
00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:47.640 align:start position:0%
I think that one of the things that was
 
00:19:49.549 --> 00:19:49.559 align:start position:0%
highlighted in the testimony is that
 
00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:51.760 align:start position:0%
there's still a lot of disagreement
 
00:19:53.909 --> 00:19:53.919 align:start position:0%
within the community uh but that the
 
00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
largest glaring issue is that right now
 
00:19:59.110 --> 00:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
the membership is not filled in the
 
00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
commission um we we were told of the
 
00:20:04.149 --> 00:20:04.159 align:start position:0%
five vacant seats but there are also
 
00:20:06.549 --> 00:20:06.559 align:start position:0%
four additional terms that have expired
 
00:20:09.630 --> 00:20:09.640 align:start position:0%
um some that expired just a week ago so
 
00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:11.200 align:start position:0%
right now there are only two Governor
 
00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:13.360 align:start position:0%
appointed members of the commission and
 
00:20:14.669 --> 00:20:14.679 align:start position:0%
then the four that are appointed
 
00:20:16.549 --> 00:20:16.559 align:start position:0%
otherwise giving them a membership of
 
00:20:19.549 --> 00:20:19.559 align:start position:0%
six with the bill that we passed last
 
00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:22.280 align:start position:0%
year to allow a quorum to be 50% plus
 
00:20:24.789 --> 00:20:24.799 align:start position:0%
one right now a quorum of the Native
 
00:20:27.669 --> 00:20:27.679 align:start position:0%
American Affairs commission is only four
 
00:20:30.549 --> 00:20:30.559 align:start position:0%
members and that could override those
 
00:20:32.549 --> 00:20:32.559 align:start position:0%
who do were appointed because of their
 
00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
native Heritage um to me that brings a
 
00:20:37.149 --> 00:20:37.159 align:start position:0%
pretty troubling concern about its
 
00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:39.960 align:start position:0%
viability especially as I reviewed the
 
00:20:42.669 --> 00:20:42.679 align:start position:0%
um annual reports and the only time that
 
00:20:45.029 --> 00:20:45.039 align:start position:0%
the commission was fully filled was when
 
00:20:47.230 --> 00:20:47.240 align:start position:0%
it was first created in
 
00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:50.520 align:start position:0%
2010 additionally there are more annual
 
00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:52.640 align:start position:0%
reports missing than are published and
 
00:20:54.549 --> 00:20:54.559 align:start position:0%
the most recent was
 
00:20:57.750 --> 00:20:57.760 align:start position:0%
2022 um I'm an itl on this bill and I
 
00:20:58.990 --> 00:20:59.000 align:start position:0%
strongly want to encourage enourage both
 
00:21:01.110 --> 00:21:01.120 align:start position:0%
the governor to nominate people to the
 
00:21:03.230 --> 00:21:03.240 align:start position:0%
commission and for those involved to
 
00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:05.280 align:start position:0%
determine um the necessity of the
 
00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:07.280 align:start position:0%
commission going forward Because unless
 
00:21:08.990 --> 00:21:09.000 align:start position:0%
there's some changes and improvements
 
00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:10.520 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure how much it benefits the
 
00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:12.880 align:start position:0%
state and I might look to repeal the
 
00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:14.760 align:start position:0%
commission next year because it doesn't
 
00:21:17.070 --> 00:21:17.080 align:start position:0%
seem to be functional and is drawing PE
 
00:21:19.470 --> 00:21:19.480 align:start position:0%
drawing their attention away from the
 
00:21:22.310 --> 00:21:22.320 align:start position:0%
internal affairs and their relationship
 
00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:24.200 align:start position:0%
with um other bands other tribes in the
 
00:21:26.549 --> 00:21:26.559 align:start position:0%
federal government um in order to try
 
00:21:28.029 --> 00:21:28.039 align:start position:0%
and deal with some New Hampshire
 
00:21:31.149 --> 00:21:31.159 align:start position:0%
creative bureaucracy so I'm hopeful that
 
00:21:32.909 --> 00:21:32.919 align:start position:0%
they'll be able to have people Nam to
 
00:21:34.430 --> 00:21:34.440 align:start position:0%
the commission that this will move
 
00:21:36.029 --> 00:21:36.039 align:start position:0%
forward and it'll start working in a
 
00:21:38.350 --> 00:21:38.360 align:start position:0%
good and effective way um but if we
 
00:21:41.070 --> 00:21:41.080 align:start position:0%
don't see otherwise um i' I'd be apt to
 
00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:44.000 align:start position:0%
uh look to end it next next year if we
 
00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:46.400 align:start position:0%
don't see progress represent BR do you
 
00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:49.440 align:start position:0%
wish to speak to your second no thank
 
00:21:53.549 --> 00:21:53.559 align:start position:0%
you representative scitec uh this bill
 
00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:55.520 align:start position:0%
uh more than almost any other has caused
 
00:21:57.470 --> 00:21:57.480 align:start position:0%
me to reflect on our job as
 
00:21:57.480 --> 00:21:59.470 align:start position:0%
me to reflect on our job as
Representatives

00:21:59.470 --> 00:21:59.480 align:start position:0%
Representatives
 
00:22:01.830 --> 00:22:01.840 align:start position:0%
uh for me I have no interest in this
 
00:22:05.549 --> 00:22:05.559 align:start position:0%
issue but I took an oath and I got on
 
00:22:08.549 --> 00:22:08.559 align:start position:0%
this committee so I have to take this
 
00:22:11.149 --> 00:22:11.159 align:start position:0%
issue seriously the
 
00:22:14.590 --> 00:22:14.600 align:start position:0%
way as seriously as the people proposing
 
00:22:17.510 --> 00:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
it and I prepared the minutes for this
 
00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:20.000 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a nightmare to try to figure
 
00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:22.000 align:start position:0%
out if I were emperor of the world I
 
00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:27.200 align:start position:0%
wouldn't know quite what to do and so it
 
00:22:29.149 --> 00:22:29.159 align:start position:0%
something has to be done
 
00:22:31.070 --> 00:22:31.080 align:start position:0%
uh but I don't know what that something
 
00:22:36.510 --> 00:22:36.520 align:start position:0%
is and it's challenge thank you for
 
00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:38.960 align:start position:0%
listening represent
 
00:22:41.630 --> 00:22:41.640 align:start position:0%
schm thank you madam chair uh and I
 
00:22:44.669 --> 00:22:44.679 align:start position:0%
appreciate representative scitec remarks
 
00:22:47.350 --> 00:22:47.360 align:start position:0%
because I am also very troubled by the
 
00:22:50.230 --> 00:22:50.240 align:start position:0%
situation and representative Leon's uh
 
00:22:53.390 --> 00:22:53.400 align:start position:0%
remarks also are very pertinent uh we've
 
00:22:56.870 --> 00:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
heard allegations about why they can't
 
00:22:59.269 --> 00:22:59.279 align:start position:0%
get a membership so they would could
 
00:23:01.710 --> 00:23:01.720 align:start position:0%
have an ordinarily function commission
 
00:23:04.070 --> 00:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
with a with a quorum that shows up and
 
00:23:07.070 --> 00:23:07.080 align:start position:0%
so forth uh and we've heard allegations
 
00:23:10.390 --> 00:23:10.400 align:start position:0%
about why uh there haven't been
 
00:23:12.350 --> 00:23:12.360 align:start position:0%
appointments and so forth and so on but
 
00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:16.480 align:start position:0%
as it is uh we were left in a situation
 
00:23:18.909 --> 00:23:18.919 align:start position:0%
where uh where this committee would have
 
00:23:20.669 --> 00:23:20.679 align:start position:0%
to make decisions with regard to a
 
00:23:22.789 --> 00:23:22.799 align:start position:0%
culture which we have next to no
 
00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:25.360 align:start position:0%
familiarity with we know I I know a
 
00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:27.440 align:start position:0%
whole handful of people who turned out
 
00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:30.400 align:start position:0%
to be indigenous I never knew because
 
00:23:33.149 --> 00:23:33.159 align:start position:0%
they don't look any different than us uh
 
00:23:36.029 --> 00:23:36.039 align:start position:0%
and uh and so the question of of how
 
00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:38.240 align:start position:0%
their culture and how there these
 
00:23:40.590 --> 00:23:40.600 align:start position:0%
administrative Affairs that we get
 
00:23:43.549 --> 00:23:43.559 align:start position:0%
confronted with over and over again uh
 
00:23:46.110 --> 00:23:46.120 align:start position:0%
how those the those are to be understood
 
00:23:49.310 --> 00:23:49.320 align:start position:0%
and to be appropriately legislated but
 
00:23:51.710 --> 00:23:51.720 align:start position:0%
without it I'm not going to I'm not
 
00:23:54.269 --> 00:23:54.279 align:start position:0%
going to vote on a bill that that I have
 
00:23:57.190 --> 00:23:57.200 align:start position:0%
no sense of certainty about what what
 
00:24:00.149 --> 00:24:00.159 align:start position:0%
we're doing so so I I also strongly
 
00:24:03.190 --> 00:24:03.200 align:start position:0%
support the idea represent uh if
 
00:24:05.669 --> 00:24:05.679 align:start position:0%
footnote to representative Schmidt one
 
00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:08.640 align:start position:0%
of the about not recognizing some people
 
00:24:11.149 --> 00:24:11.159 align:start position:0%
as indigenous one of the testifiers was
 
00:24:13.230 --> 00:24:13.240 align:start position:0%
a fellow teacher at Salem
 
00:24:16.669 --> 00:24:16.679 align:start position:0%
High amazing I didn't never
 
00:24:19.950 --> 00:24:19.960 align:start position:0%
know as the sponsor of this
 
00:24:25.510 --> 00:24:25.520 align:start position:0%
bill I was expecting some opposition but
 
00:24:29.950 --> 00:24:29.960 align:start position:0%
I was really shocked by the amount of
 
00:24:31.990 --> 00:24:32.000 align:start position:0%
conflict within the Native American
 
00:24:34.029 --> 00:24:34.039 align:start position:0%
community in New
 
00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:39.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I had a report from one of
 
00:24:43.310 --> 00:24:43.320 align:start position:0%
them that the issues are from the time
 
00:24:46.190 --> 00:24:46.200 align:start position:0%
of King Philip's War in the
 
00:24:49.870 --> 00:24:49.880 align:start position:0%
1700s well we're not going to solve that
 
00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:52.440 align:start position:0%
by any easy Manner and then we got a
 
00:24:55.389 --> 00:24:55.399 align:start position:0%
letter from the abanaki council from in
 
00:24:59.350 --> 00:24:59.360 align:start position:0%
Quebec which is the center of the nation
 
00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:01.200 align:start position:0%
and they're concerned and they're also
 
00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:03.360 align:start position:0%
very concerned with the Vermont state
 
00:25:05.269 --> 00:25:05.279 align:start position:0%
recognition they believe that that
 
00:25:06.549 --> 00:25:06.559 align:start position:0%
process was
 
00:25:09.310 --> 00:25:09.320 align:start position:0%
incorrect and at that point if it's
 
00:25:12.669 --> 00:25:12.679 align:start position:0%
between the abanaki nation and the state
 
00:25:14.350 --> 00:25:14.360 align:start position:0%
of Vermont and the state of New
 
00:25:16.470 --> 00:25:16.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I don't want to get in the
 
00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:18.080 align:start position:0%
middle of this I think that is
 
00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:20.640 align:start position:0%
definitely above our pay grade we ought
 
00:25:25.310 --> 00:25:25.320 align:start position:0%
to let the parties involved deal with it
 
00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:28.360 align:start position:0%
themselves and I mean a commission's not
 
00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:30.120 align:start position:0%
not going to do make a big deal either
 
00:25:32.269 --> 00:25:32.279 align:start position:0%
way but I think we ought to
 
00:25:36.230 --> 00:25:36.240 align:start position:0%
say the issues are beyond our
 
00:25:38.789 --> 00:25:38.799 align:start position:0%
scope anyone
 
00:25:41.190 --> 00:25:41.200 align:start position:0%
else all right thank you the motion is
 
00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:44.760 align:start position:0%
in expedient to legislate on House Bill
 
00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:48.000 align:start position:0%

032 all right that's moved by
 
00:28:45.750 --> 00:28:45.760 align:start position:0%
representative Lon I'll second and I
 
00:28:47.990 --> 00:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
would like to ask Mr Sherman who's the
 
00:28:50.389 --> 00:28:50.399 align:start position:0%
chair of the building code review board
 
00:28:53.389 --> 00:28:53.399 align:start position:0%
to explain to us why we need
 
00:28:59.549 --> 00:28:59.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:01.549 --> 00:29:01.559 align:start position:0%
question to the chair yes sir would it
 
00:29:03.230 --> 00:29:03.240 align:start position:0%
be possible that we could res recess
 
00:29:06.430 --> 00:29:06.440 align:start position:0%
this uh momentarily so that we can get
 
00:29:09.149 --> 00:29:09.159 align:start position:0%
at it with a little bit more time to
 
00:29:11.950 --> 00:29:11.960 align:start position:0%
pull our act together um I would like to
 
00:29:14.509 --> 00:29:14.519 align:start position:0%
have Mr Sherman explain why we need them
 
00:29:16.509 --> 00:29:16.519 align:start position:0%
first while everybody I'm happy with
 
00:29:18.389 --> 00:29:18.399 align:start position:0%
that digs through their piles of papers
 
00:29:21.230 --> 00:29:21.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:23.590 --> 00:29:23.600 align:start position:0%
amendment Madam chair member of the
 
00:29:25.950 --> 00:29:25.960 align:start position:0%
members of the committee um I came here
 
00:29:28.669 --> 00:29:28.679 align:start position:0%
today to listen so
 
00:29:32.630 --> 00:29:32.640 align:start position:0%
here we are uh this the bill proper
 
00:29:34.830 --> 00:29:34.840 align:start position:0%
proposes to eliminate all local
 
00:29:37.389 --> 00:29:37.399 align:start position:0%
amendments to the State Building Code
 
00:29:40.389 --> 00:29:40.399 align:start position:0%
this amendment does a couple of things
 
00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:43.760 align:start position:0%
um it maintains the ability for
 
00:29:46.549 --> 00:29:46.559 align:start position:0%
municipalities to do administrative
 
00:29:48.909 --> 00:29:48.919 align:start position:0%
amendments and by that I mean if you've
 
00:29:50.389 --> 00:29:50.399 align:start position:0%
been into the model codes it's
 
00:29:53.549 --> 00:29:53.559 align:start position:0%
essentially chapter one stuff so it's
 
00:29:55.789 --> 00:29:55.799 align:start position:0%
how do you get a permit how do you deal
 
00:29:57.750 --> 00:29:57.760 align:start position:0%
with inspections how do you deal with
 
00:30:00.230 --> 00:30:00.240 align:start position:0%
CER certificates of occupancy fee
 
00:30:04.430 --> 00:30:04.440 align:start position:0%
schedules those kinds of things um
 
00:30:07.029 --> 00:30:07.039 align:start position:0%
currently the way we adopt the building
 
00:30:10.830 --> 00:30:10.840 align:start position:0%
codes the language in the model codes is
 
00:30:13.070 --> 00:30:13.080 align:start position:0%
co-equal to any other language in
 
00:30:16.310 --> 00:30:16.320 align:start position:0%
statute according to doj so that gives
 
00:30:19.990 --> 00:30:20.000 align:start position:0%
us the need to be able to uh modify some
 
00:30:22.110 --> 00:30:22.120 align:start position:0%
of this stuff where you know a city of
 
00:30:25.110 --> 00:30:25.120 align:start position:0%
Manchester operates their processes
 
00:30:28.029 --> 00:30:28.039 align:start position:0%
differently than some small town it
 
00:30:31.070 --> 00:30:31.080 align:start position:0%
administrative should not in fact uh
 
00:30:33.389 --> 00:30:33.399 align:start position:0%
impact how the building itself is
 
00:30:35.190 --> 00:30:35.200 align:start position:0%
constructed we're referring to those as
 
00:30:37.789 --> 00:30:37.799 align:start position:0%
technical amendments so administrative
 
00:30:40.149 --> 00:30:40.159 align:start position:0%
as paperwork process those kinds of
 
00:30:42.549 --> 00:30:42.559 align:start position:0%
things and we've tried to Define that in
 
00:30:46.630 --> 00:30:46.640 align:start position:0%
here um whereas technical as with the
 
00:30:49.350 --> 00:30:49.360 align:start position:0%
base bill would still be
 
00:30:52.549 --> 00:30:52.559 align:start position:0%
prohibited the second thing this does is
 
00:30:56.470 --> 00:30:56.480 align:start position:0%
that um HB 241 which is is I think going
 
00:31:01.269 --> 00:31:01.279 align:start position:0%
to a a longer term study um attempts to
 
00:31:04.110 --> 00:31:04.120 align:start position:0%
take the various places that the State
 
00:31:06.310 --> 00:31:06.320 align:start position:0%
Building Code has addressed and get it
 
00:31:07.430 --> 00:31:07.440 align:start position:0%
all into
 
00:31:10.110 --> 00:31:10.120 align:start position:0%
155a a lot of these tentacles still
 
00:31:14.750 --> 00:31:14.760 align:start position:0%
reside in in RSA 674 and other land use
 
00:31:17.830 --> 00:31:17.840 align:start position:0%
chapters and it's very confusing as I
 
00:31:19.230 --> 00:31:19.240 align:start position:0%
understand it to the people out there
 
00:31:21.110 --> 00:31:21.120 align:start position:0%
enforcing things because many of them
 
00:31:23.710 --> 00:31:23.720 align:start position:0%
enforce both land use and building codes
 
00:31:25.350 --> 00:31:25.360 align:start position:0%
so we're just trying to take some of the
 
00:31:27.549 --> 00:31:27.559 align:start position:0%
old language that's been there for a
 
00:31:30.870 --> 00:31:30.880 align:start position:0%
long long time and get it into
 
00:31:33.669 --> 00:31:33.679 align:start position:0%
155a on the issues that are involved
 
00:31:36.669 --> 00:31:36.679 align:start position:0%
with Municipal amendments and
 
00:31:36.679 --> 00:31:38.549 align:start position:0%
with Municipal amendments and
specifically

00:31:38.549 --> 00:31:38.559 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
00:31:41.070 --> 00:31:41.080 align:start position:0%
67451 this amendment just gets them over
 
00:31:43.629 --> 00:31:43.639 align:start position:0%
into 155a so we don't have to change
 
00:31:45.430 --> 00:31:45.440 align:start position:0%
them once and then turn around and
 
00:31:47.350 --> 00:31:47.360 align:start position:0%
change it again probably next year to
 
00:31:49.710 --> 00:31:49.720 align:start position:0%
get them into the right spot so there's
 
00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:52.320 align:start position:0%
a fair amount of ink in here but but
 
00:31:55.590 --> 00:31:55.600 align:start position:0%
much of it is simply language that's in
 
00:31:59.230 --> 00:31:59.240 align:start position:0%
67451 now we've brought it in eliminated
 
00:32:01.350 --> 00:32:01.360 align:start position:0%
some duplication cleaned up some
 
00:32:04.029 --> 00:32:04.039 align:start position:0%
terminology so that everybody's using
 
00:32:06.789 --> 00:32:06.799 align:start position:0%
the same words but primarily this is
 
00:32:09.430 --> 00:32:09.440 align:start position:0%
intended to permit these administrative
 
00:32:12.269 --> 00:32:12.279 align:start position:0%
amendments which I I think personally
 
00:32:14.870 --> 00:32:14.880 align:start position:0%
are necessary uh to
 
00:32:18.830 --> 00:32:18.840 align:start position:0%
operate okay representative re thank you
 
00:32:21.909 --> 00:32:21.919 align:start position:0%
madam chair so in reading this amendment
 
00:32:23.430 --> 00:32:23.440 align:start position:0%
I want to make sure that I'm firmly
 
00:32:25.029 --> 00:32:25.039 align:start position:0%
understanding this with the the
 
00:32:26.870 --> 00:32:26.880 align:start position:0%
distinction between the technical and
 
00:32:29.389 --> 00:32:29.399 align:start position:0%
administ admin ministrative so sorry I'm
 
00:32:33.350 --> 00:32:33.360 align:start position:0%
not well um the the technical changes
 
00:32:36.029 --> 00:32:36.039 align:start position:0%
this would bar municipalities make sure
 
00:32:37.230 --> 00:32:37.240 align:start position:0%
I'm understanding this bar
 
00:32:40.190 --> 00:32:40.200 align:start position:0%
municipalities from setting a higher
 
00:32:42.789 --> 00:32:42.799 align:start position:0%
standard on the building code a
 
00:32:44.990 --> 00:32:45.000 align:start position:0%
technical standard for example another
 
00:32:46.750 --> 00:32:46.760 align:start position:0%
foot of free board or another two feet
 
00:32:49.110 --> 00:32:49.120 align:start position:0%
of free board is that correct that's the
 
00:32:51.230 --> 00:32:51.240 align:start position:0%
intent of the base Bill and this
 
00:32:54.070 --> 00:32:54.080 align:start position:0%
amendment doesn't change that intent so
 
00:32:58.870 --> 00:32:58.880 align:start position:0%
yes okay so it would actually it m sorry
 
00:33:01.789 --> 00:33:01.799 align:start position:0%
Madam chair it would actually take away
 
00:33:04.029 --> 00:33:04.039 align:start position:0%
the right of municipalities to set
 
00:33:06.029 --> 00:33:06.039 align:start position:0%
higher standards than the building code
 
00:33:08.430 --> 00:33:08.440 align:start position:0%
is that correct that's the intent of the
 
00:33:12.269 --> 00:33:12.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:14.230 --> 00:33:14.240 align:start position:0%
you all right are there any other
 
00:33:16.190 --> 00:33:16.200 align:start position:0%
questions for Mr
 
00:33:18.430 --> 00:33:18.440 align:start position:0%
Sherman all right seeing none thank you
 
00:33:20.789 --> 00:33:20.799 align:start position:0%
very much for that information I wasn't
 
00:33:23.190 --> 00:33:23.200 align:start position:0%
sure why we needed them until I until
 
00:33:25.029 --> 00:33:25.039 align:start position:0%
you explained that the building code had
 
00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
things like fees and uh permit
 
00:33:30.029 --> 00:33:30.039 align:start position:0%
procedures which
 
00:33:33.750 --> 00:33:33.760 align:start position:0%
are obviously going to vary between say
 
00:33:35.789 --> 00:33:35.799 align:start position:0%
Manchester and
 
00:33:38.070 --> 00:33:38.080 align:start position:0%
abson any other
 
00:33:42.070 --> 00:33:42.080 align:start position:0%
comments person SL you just just getting
 
00:33:47.269 --> 00:33:47.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:47.279 --> 00:33:49.190 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:33:49.190 --> 00:33:49.200 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:50.750 align:start position:0%
yeah
okay

00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:50.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:33:55.029 --> 00:33:55.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:57.350 --> 00:33:57.360 align:start position:0%
stff I'm so glad you're having a good
 
00:34:02.389 --> 00:34:02.399 align:start position:0%
time to gentlemen anyone else comments
 
00:34:06.230 --> 00:34:06.240 align:start position:0%
questions all right
 
00:34:10.669 --> 00:34:10.679 align:start position:0%
um just for ease of discussion I'd like
 
00:34:12.950 --> 00:34:12.960 align:start position:0%
to i' encourage you to support the
 
00:34:15.589 --> 00:34:15.599 align:start position:0%
amendment even if you don't support the
 
00:34:17.829 --> 00:34:17.839 align:start position:0%
concept of the bill because this does
 
00:34:20.510 --> 00:34:20.520 align:start position:0%
not change the concept of the bill it
 
00:34:23.470 --> 00:34:23.480 align:start position:0%
simply makes it feasible for the
 
00:34:25.990 --> 00:34:26.000 align:start position:0%
administrative items representative gr
 
00:34:28.030 --> 00:34:28.040 align:start position:0%
yes I I will I support support the
 
00:34:29.629 --> 00:34:29.639 align:start position:0%
amendment I will not support the bill
 
00:34:31.270 --> 00:34:31.280 align:start position:0%
but I do appreciate the work that was
 
00:34:33.589 --> 00:34:33.599 align:start position:0%
done on the amendment and I thank you so
 
00:34:36.310 --> 00:34:36.320 align:start position:0%
I'll second okay I take it that was a
 
00:34:39.389 --> 00:34:39.399 align:start position:0%
motion to no the motion has was made by
 
00:34:41.790 --> 00:34:41.800 align:start position:0%
representative Lyon and seconded By Me
 
00:34:44.069 --> 00:34:44.079 align:start position:0%
Oh but we haven't voted on it how
 
00:34:47.190 --> 00:34:47.200 align:start position:0%
quickly we forget okay any further
 
00:34:49.589 --> 00:34:49.599 align:start position:0%
comments questions
 
00:34:54.950 --> 00:34:54.960 align:start position:0%
discussion represent PCH uh in a brief
 
00:34:56.909 --> 00:34:56.919 align:start position:0%
part of my career I actually build some
 
00:35:00.030 --> 00:35:00.040 align:start position:0%
houses and we were very fortunate that
 
00:35:02.550 --> 00:35:02.560 align:start position:0%
we had good inspectors but it wasn't
 
00:35:05.589 --> 00:35:05.599 align:start position:0%
hard to see how the code could
 
00:35:10.710 --> 00:35:10.720 align:start position:0%
be weaponized and um I think the
 
00:35:13.589 --> 00:35:13.599 align:start position:0%
practicalities of this
 
00:35:17.829 --> 00:35:17.839 align:start position:0%
are important that uh I don't want to
 
00:35:20.790 --> 00:35:20.800 align:start position:0%
see there's a sense that the towns are
 
00:35:22.950 --> 00:35:22.960 align:start position:0%
going to be even better than the state
 
00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:25.680 align:start position:0%
code and I believe the state code
 
00:35:28.990 --> 00:35:29.000 align:start position:0%
is uh plenty good
 
00:35:32.870 --> 00:35:32.880 align:start position:0%
enough um that's my experience thank
 
00:35:36.510 --> 00:35:36.520 align:start position:0%
you represent long so this is another
 
00:35:39.109 --> 00:35:39.119 align:start position:0%
bill where uh my constituent's concerned
 
00:35:42.230 --> 00:35:42.240 align:start position:0%
about housing costs is my overriding
 
00:35:45.550 --> 00:35:45.560 align:start position:0%
concern uh and determining my vote uh so
 
00:35:47.750 --> 00:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
I will be voting for the bill I will
 
00:35:49.990 --> 00:35:50.000 align:start position:0%
vote for the amendment uh but I do think
 
00:35:52.390 --> 00:35:52.400 align:start position:0%
that Municipal governments have tended
 
00:35:55.589 --> 00:35:55.599 align:start position:0%
to abuse the powers that they've had uh
 
00:35:57.349 --> 00:35:57.359 align:start position:0%
and take away the freedoms of their
 
00:36:00.829 --> 00:36:00.839 align:start position:0%
citizen and that has resulted in uh
 
00:36:03.030 --> 00:36:03.040 align:start position:0%
being very hard to find an affordable
 
00:36:04.510 --> 00:36:04.520 align:start position:0%
place to live these
 
00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:07.230 align:start position:0%
place to live these
days

00:36:07.230 --> 00:36:07.240 align:start position:0%
days
 
00:36:11.230 --> 00:36:11.240 align:start position:0%
yes yeah and the the point that so many
 
00:36:13.109 --> 00:36:13.119 align:start position:0%
people eager
 
00:36:16.910 --> 00:36:16.920 align:start position:0%
for uh Advanced housing or extremely
 
00:36:19.349 --> 00:36:19.359 align:start position:0%
efficient buildings or whatever forget
 
00:36:22.150 --> 00:36:22.160 align:start position:0%
is that the state building code is the
 
00:36:26.790 --> 00:36:26.800 align:start position:0%
minimum it is not a stretch code it is
 
00:36:29.510 --> 00:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
the the minimum minum for safety
 
00:36:32.910 --> 00:36:32.920 align:start position:0%
required to to to build in the state and
 
00:36:35.950 --> 00:36:35.960 align:start position:0%
that's and that's why I'm concerned
 
00:36:38.109 --> 00:36:38.119 align:start position:0%
about Municipal amendments besides the
 
00:36:40.670 --> 00:36:40.680 align:start position:0%
fact that as representative long said
 
00:36:42.309 --> 00:36:42.319 align:start position:0%
they're subject to
 
00:36:46.270 --> 00:36:46.280 align:start position:0%
abuse um particularly before we
 
00:36:49.510 --> 00:36:49.520 align:start position:0%
instituted a formal a requirement that
 
00:36:52.030 --> 00:36:52.040 align:start position:0%
Municipal amendments be formally
 
00:36:56.910 --> 00:36:56.920 align:start position:0%
adopted there were many many cases of
 
00:37:00.069 --> 00:37:00.079 align:start position:0%
individual building inspectors making up
 
00:37:02.829 --> 00:37:02.839 align:start position:0%
the rules as they went along not all of
 
00:37:05.910 --> 00:37:05.920 align:start position:0%
them not but it it happened enough that
 
00:37:09.309 --> 00:37:09.319 align:start position:0%
we heard about it from many people and
 
00:37:09.319 --> 00:37:10.230 align:start position:0%
we heard about it from many people and
if

00:37:10.230 --> 00:37:10.240 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:37:14.870 --> 00:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
they're having a basic Statewide
 
00:37:18.309 --> 00:37:18.319 align:start position:0%
building code should prevent that from
 
00:37:22.069 --> 00:37:22.079 align:start position:0%
happening in the future anybody
 
00:37:24.670 --> 00:37:24.680 align:start position:0%
else all right not seeing anybody the
 
00:37:27.910 --> 00:37:27.920 align:start position:0%
motion is to adopt Amendment 0328 to
 
00:37:30.750 --> 00:37:30.760 align:start position:0%
House Bill 428 representative who made
 
00:37:32.950 --> 00:37:32.960 align:start position:0%
the motion Mr L on representative L made
 
00:37:35.550 --> 00:37:35.560 align:start position:0%
the motion I second
 
00:37:37.950 --> 00:37:37.960 align:start position:0%
okay you can call the role now that
 
00:37:41.190 --> 00:37:41.200 align:start position:0%
you're ready I am ready um Vice chairman
 
00:37:44.589 --> 00:37:44.599 align:start position:0%

representative Lon um yes I I move ought
 
00:38:28.349 --> 00:38:28.359 align:start position:0%
to pass as Amendment
 
00:38:32.670 --> 00:38:32.680 align:start position:0%
by the amendment we just adopted
 
00:38:37.309 --> 00:38:37.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:40.990 --> 00:38:41.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:43.710 align:start position:0%
 
you

00:38:43.710 --> 00:38:43.720 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:38:46.790 --> 00:38:46.800 align:start position:0%
okay all right so now that we've made
 
00:38:48.390 --> 00:38:48.400 align:start position:0%
the the bill feasible is there any
 
00:38:50.710 --> 00:38:50.720 align:start position:0%
discussion representative Leon uh thank
 
00:38:53.309 --> 00:38:53.319 align:start position:0%
you madam chair um I think it is very CR
 
00:38:54.790 --> 00:38:54.800 align:start position:0%
crucial to understand that these are the
 
00:38:56.790 --> 00:38:56.800 align:start position:0%
bare minimums that allow people to have
 
00:38:58.589 --> 00:38:58.599 align:start position:0%
housing that is is safe and allows them
 
00:39:01.630 --> 00:39:01.640 align:start position:0%
to live um and that these also apply
 
00:39:03.550 --> 00:39:03.560 align:start position:0%
when you have Renovations as well so I
 
00:39:06.309 --> 00:39:06.319 align:start position:0%
want to ensure that we aren't having uh
 
00:39:07.710 --> 00:39:07.720 align:start position:0%
people in the granite state who are
 
00:39:09.550 --> 00:39:09.560 align:start position:0%
afraid to make necessary improvements
 
00:39:11.349 --> 00:39:11.359 align:start position:0%
just because it moves them past that
 
00:39:13.430 --> 00:39:13.440 align:start position:0%
that point where we they need uh they
 
00:39:15.349 --> 00:39:15.359 align:start position:0%
need to have code updates and I'd rather
 
00:39:17.190 --> 00:39:17.200 align:start position:0%
have them improve their home as
 
00:39:19.309 --> 00:39:19.319 align:start position:0%
necessary in a way that they can afford
 
00:39:20.870 --> 00:39:20.880 align:start position:0%
and that they can work with without
 
00:39:24.790 --> 00:39:24.800 align:start position:0%
having the Quagmire of having a hard
 
00:39:26.309 --> 00:39:26.319 align:start position:0%
time finding a builder because they
 
00:39:27.630 --> 00:39:27.640 align:start position:0%
don't want to deal with their talent
 
00:39:28.829 --> 00:39:28.839 align:start position:0%
because their Town hasn't been
 
00:39:31.349 --> 00:39:31.359 align:start position:0%
transparent about what changes are made
 
00:39:34.470 --> 00:39:34.480 align:start position:0%
um as it is as it is it's hard to find
 
00:39:36.190 --> 00:39:36.200 align:start position:0%
somebody to work with hard to find some
 
00:39:37.470 --> 00:39:37.480 align:start position:0%
it's hard to find the right person
 
00:39:39.470 --> 00:39:39.480 align:start position:0%
because there's so many different styles
 
00:39:41.270 --> 00:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
and if you're excluding people that
 
00:39:43.589 --> 00:39:43.599 align:start position:0%
don't want to work with a difficult town
 
00:39:44.990 --> 00:39:45.000 align:start position:0%
that becomes even more difficult and
 
00:39:46.910 --> 00:39:46.920 align:start position:0%
more expensive for the people that we
 
00:39:49.190 --> 00:39:49.200 align:start position:0%
represent um so I believe that this is
 
00:39:51.030 --> 00:39:51.040 align:start position:0%
important to have consistency among the
 
00:39:54.790 --> 00:39:54.800 align:start position:0%
state and as a when I do build an early
 
00:39:56.589 --> 00:39:56.599 align:start position:0%
adopter a lot of these Innovations I'm
 
00:39:58.190 --> 00:39:58.200 align:start position:0%
sure I'll be going above and beyond but
 
00:40:00.230 --> 00:40:00.240 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to force my neighbor who's
 
00:40:02.390 --> 00:40:02.400 align:start position:0%
choosing between doing an important
 
00:40:04.230 --> 00:40:04.240 align:start position:0%
renovation to replace things and keep
 
00:40:06.990 --> 00:40:07.000 align:start position:0%
things safe and uh putting food on the
 
00:40:09.190 --> 00:40:09.200 align:start position:0%
table represent zelers do you wish to
 
00:40:10.829 --> 00:40:10.839 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion your a second yeah
 
00:40:13.670 --> 00:40:13.680 align:start position:0%
thank you madam CL the the point I want
 
00:40:16.870 --> 00:40:16.880 align:start position:0%
to drive was if you had
 
00:40:19.349 --> 00:40:19.359 align:start position:0%
multiple codes you had to follow it's
 
00:40:22.470 --> 00:40:22.480 align:start position:0%
going to drive housing up especially in
 
00:40:25.470 --> 00:40:25.480 align:start position:0%
uh specific towns or cities and if I was
 
00:40:28.150 --> 00:40:28.160 align:start position:0%
a builder I'd ought to let I I'd have to
 
00:40:29.950 --> 00:40:29.960 align:start position:0%
automatically know saying oh if I go to
 
00:40:32.109 --> 00:40:32.119 align:start position:0%
Manchester it's going to cost me $20,000
 
00:40:34.390 --> 00:40:34.400 align:start position:0%
more to build this house so I'm gonna up
 
00:40:36.710 --> 00:40:36.720 align:start position:0%
my price automatically just because I
 
00:40:38.349 --> 00:40:38.359 align:start position:0%
have to follow a different building code
 
00:40:40.550 --> 00:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
I think it's just it's it's going to
 
00:40:43.069 --> 00:40:43.079 align:start position:0%
drive the price of housing up if we have
 
00:40:45.870 --> 00:40:45.880 align:start position:0%
multiple codes to follow thank you
 
00:40:48.910 --> 00:40:48.920 align:start position:0%
anyone else representative de re yeah I
 
00:40:51.390 --> 00:40:51.400 align:start position:0%
I think I have to go in on um local
 
00:40:56.030 --> 00:40:56.040 align:start position:0%
control here uh this bill we this sets a
 
00:40:58.750 --> 00:40:58.760 align:start position:0%
minimum and what it is doing is saying
 
00:41:02.190 --> 00:41:02.200 align:start position:0%
that municipalities cannot then add to
 
00:41:05.150 --> 00:41:05.160 align:start position:0%
that so the provisions that my town
 
00:41:07.750 --> 00:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
takes in adding to requirements for our
 
00:41:10.550 --> 00:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
building code if this passes is going to
 
00:41:15.230 --> 00:41:15.240 align:start position:0%
go away so our town my town has a severe
 
00:41:17.109 --> 00:41:17.119 align:start position:0%
flooding problem and so we have a
 
00:41:18.870 --> 00:41:18.880 align:start position:0%
requirement that an extra foot of free
 
00:41:22.030 --> 00:41:22.040 align:start position:0%
Board needs to be added that is not
 
00:41:24.150 --> 00:41:24.160 align:start position:0%
adding significantly to people's housing
 
00:41:26.230 --> 00:41:26.240 align:start position:0%
cost that is not the core of our
 
00:41:28.710 --> 00:41:28.720 align:start position:0%
affordable housing problem what it does
 
00:41:30.790 --> 00:41:30.800 align:start position:0%
is it helps to protect the people who
 
00:41:33.390 --> 00:41:33.400 align:start position:0%
are building new homes to ensure that
 
00:41:35.750 --> 00:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
those properties are sustainable for a
 
00:41:38.030 --> 00:41:38.040 align:start position:0%
longer period of time and their asset is
 
00:41:41.390 --> 00:41:41.400 align:start position:0%
protected so I am absolutely for setting
 
00:41:44.069 --> 00:41:44.079 align:start position:0%
minimums that's great but the provision
 
00:41:46.670 --> 00:41:46.680 align:start position:0%
as part of this amendment as part of
 
00:41:49.309 --> 00:41:49.319 align:start position:0%
this bill that municipalities cannot add
 
00:41:52.270 --> 00:41:52.280 align:start position:0%
to that um and and in order to add to it
 
00:41:53.349 --> 00:41:53.359 align:start position:0%
they've got to get the permission of
 
00:41:56.309 --> 00:41:56.319 align:start position:0%
their voters my understanding um but
 
00:41:59.670 --> 00:41:59.680 align:start position:0%
they cannot add to that is problematic
 
00:42:01.589 --> 00:42:01.599 align:start position:0%
because it takes away the right of
 
00:42:04.230 --> 00:42:04.240 align:start position:0%
municipalities to set condition to set
 
00:42:06.510 --> 00:42:06.520 align:start position:0%
requirements that respond to local
 
00:42:08.550 --> 00:42:08.560 align:start position:0%
conditions so for that reason I'll be
 
00:42:10.870 --> 00:42:10.880 align:start position:0%
voting against this you representative
 
00:42:13.309 --> 00:42:13.319 align:start position:0%
Lam uh thank you madam chair I I do want
 
00:42:14.710 --> 00:42:14.720 align:start position:0%
to say that I do believe in local
 
00:42:17.190 --> 00:42:17.200 align:start position:0%
control and a lot of that local control
 
00:42:18.670 --> 00:42:18.680 align:start position:0%
comes to somebody looking at the
 
00:42:20.630 --> 00:42:20.640 align:start position:0%
situation looking and having the
 
00:42:23.109 --> 00:42:23.119 align:start position:0%
education which still can be provided to
 
00:42:24.670 --> 00:42:24.680 align:start position:0%
have the education that perhaps you
 
00:42:26.230 --> 00:42:26.240 align:start position:0%
should have more freeboard to protect
 
00:42:28.230 --> 00:42:28.240 align:start position:0%
against flooding but I'm looking at
 
00:42:29.829 --> 00:42:29.839 align:start position:0%
those households and those individuals
 
00:42:32.630 --> 00:42:32.640 align:start position:0%
that are making these choices um and not
 
00:42:35.790 --> 00:42:35.800 align:start position:0%
say the 1900 people out of a 35,000
 
00:42:37.549 --> 00:42:37.559 align:start position:0%
person in town that showed up to vote
 
00:42:39.990 --> 00:42:40.000 align:start position:0%
yesterday uh because local control works
 
00:42:42.270 --> 00:42:42.280 align:start position:0%
when people are locally involved and I
 
00:42:43.790 --> 00:42:43.800 align:start position:0%
believe at the ultimate local control
 
00:42:45.950 --> 00:42:45.960 align:start position:0%
which is our
 
00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:47.750 align:start position:0%
which is our
citizens

00:42:47.750 --> 00:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
citizens
 
00:42:50.950 --> 00:42:50.960 align:start position:0%
okay representative re one rebuttal
 
00:42:54.230 --> 00:42:54.240 align:start position:0%
thank you um this is taking away local
 
00:42:56.549 --> 00:42:56.559 align:start position:0%
control absolutely and I just want to
 
00:42:58.470 --> 00:42:58.480 align:start position:0%
make sure that I'm Crystal Clair about
 
00:43:02.870 --> 00:43:02.880 align:start position:0%
that okay it is any other anyone else
 
00:43:04.829 --> 00:43:04.839 align:start position:0%
want to make a
 
00:43:08.589 --> 00:43:08.599 align:start position:0%
comment all right the motion is ought to

04958 for House Bill
 
00:49:45.589 --> 00:49:45.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:47.510 --> 00:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
second do you wish to speak to your
 
00:49:49.910 --> 00:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
motion yes so there was a concern
 
00:49:53.190 --> 00:49:53.200 align:start position:0%
between the licensing the board and the
 
00:49:55.630 --> 00:49:55.640 align:start position:0%
association the social workers
 
00:49:55.640 --> 00:49:57.270 align:start position:0%
association the social workers
Association

00:49:57.270 --> 00:49:57.280 align:start position:0%
Association
 
00:50:01.390 --> 00:50:01.400 align:start position:0%
and the um differences were resolved in
 
00:50:02.789 --> 00:50:02.799 align:start position:0%
the sub
 
00:50:07.589 --> 00:50:07.599 align:start position:0%
committee and it asks the board to come
 
00:50:10.630 --> 00:50:10.640 align:start position:0%
to design a test that is appropriate for
 
00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:11.630 align:start position:0%
to design a test that is appropriate for
an

00:50:11.630 --> 00:50:11.640 align:start position:0%
an
 
00:50:16.470 --> 00:50:16.480 align:start position:0%
associate uh social worker and that is
 
00:50:20.390 --> 00:50:20.400 align:start position:0%
how um the amendment was
 
00:50:23.510 --> 00:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
crafted okay and I like to mention that
 
00:50:27.549 --> 00:50:27.559 align:start position:0%
the testimony showed that the test that
 
00:50:31.470 --> 00:50:31.480 align:start position:0%
was in originally required was not
 
00:50:33.349 --> 00:50:33.359 align:start position:0%
relevant to the duties of the social
 
00:50:33.359 --> 00:50:34.270 align:start position:0%
relevant to the duties of the social
work

00:50:34.270 --> 00:50:34.280 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:50:36.829 --> 00:50:36.839 align:start position:0%
Associates and therefore only one person
 
00:50:41.109 --> 00:50:41.119 align:start position:0%
had bothered to take the test uh if we
 
00:50:43.109 --> 00:50:43.119 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure we need to have a licensed
 
00:50:47.349 --> 00:50:47.359 align:start position:0%
Social Work ass associate but if we do
 
00:50:49.349 --> 00:50:49.359 align:start position:0%
we need to make sure the qualifications
 
00:50:51.910 --> 00:50:51.920 align:start position:0%
are actually relevant to the job and
 
00:50:53.230 --> 00:50:53.240 align:start position:0%
this will make it
 
00:50:55.390 --> 00:50:55.400 align:start position:0%
so anyone
 
00:50:58.630 --> 00:50:58.640 align:start position:0%
else thank you M thank you madam chair
 
00:51:01.270 --> 00:51:01.280 align:start position:0%
so and the bottom line here is not only
 
00:51:03.950 --> 00:51:03.960 align:start position:0%
what the chair just said but also the
 
00:51:07.870 --> 00:51:07.880 align:start position:0%
fact that uh the the pay for this job is
 
00:51:11.109 --> 00:51:11.119 align:start position:0%
not commensurate with the difficulty in
 
00:51:13.470 --> 00:51:13.480 align:start position:0%
in jumping through all the hoops and
 
00:51:16.470 --> 00:51:16.480 align:start position:0%
that net effect is they're very short on
 
00:51:19.510 --> 00:51:19.520 align:start position:0%
actual worker bees so uh this should
 
00:51:23.430 --> 00:51:23.440 align:start position:0%
open the door to a more reasonable uh
 
00:51:25.870 --> 00:51:25.880 align:start position:0%
pool of people willing to do the job for
 
00:51:29.349 --> 00:51:29.359 align:start position:0%
the pay off thank you all right anyone
 
00:51:34.230 --> 00:51:34.240 align:start position:0%
else repres um experience again I have a
 
00:51:38.109 --> 00:51:38.119 align:start position:0%
daughter who is an APRN and U she passed
 
00:51:40.390 --> 00:51:40.400 align:start position:0%
all the tests but they were minimum
 
00:51:44.150 --> 00:51:44.160 align:start position:0%
requirements the real education started
 
00:51:48.390 --> 00:51:48.400 align:start position:0%
uh when we added to the code and she was
 
00:51:50.470 --> 00:51:50.480 align:start position:0%
on the floor that's where it really
 
00:51:53.510 --> 00:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
happened uh but without the groundwork
 
00:51:56.750 --> 00:51:56.760 align:start position:0%
it would not have been effective
 
00:51:58.230 --> 00:51:58.240 align:start position:0%
okay anyone
 
00:52:00.990 --> 00:52:01.000 align:start position:0%
else all right the motion is to accept
 
00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:02.510 align:start position:0%
else all right the motion is to accept

00:59:12.960 --> 00:59:17.069 align:start position:0%
 
2025-the

00:59:17.069 --> 00:59:17.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:19.750 --> 00:59:19.760 align:start position:0%
of the original Bill looking at any
 
00:59:22.630 --> 00:59:22.640 align:start position:0%
lease with the with the subdivisions um
 
00:59:24.510 --> 00:59:24.520 align:start position:0%
this one only deals with political
 
00:59:27.109 --> 00:59:27.119 align:start position:0%
subdivisions and leases is um with the
 
00:59:30.190 --> 00:59:30.200 align:start position:0%
state this is a small bite at the Apple
 
00:59:31.630 --> 00:59:31.640 align:start position:0%
but this is something that'll address
 
00:59:33.910 --> 00:59:33.920 align:start position:0%
the largest issues that we saw around
 
00:59:36.789 --> 00:59:36.799 align:start position:0%
the prices charged um to use courtrooms
 
00:59:38.950 --> 00:59:38.960 align:start position:0%
and and other Municipal land I think
 
00:59:40.829 --> 00:59:40.839 align:start position:0%
that this is a good way to get good
 
00:59:44.430 --> 00:59:44.440 align:start position:0%
Clarity and make sure that one one group
 
00:59:46.990 --> 00:59:47.000 align:start position:0%
of taxpayers isn't subsidizing another
 
00:59:50.109 --> 00:59:50.119 align:start position:0%
in One Direction or the other and um so
 
00:59:53.109 --> 00:59:53.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:57.270 --> 00:59:57.280 align:start position:0%
option all right representative Aly
 
01:00:00.750 --> 01:00:00.760 align:start position:0%
nothing to add all right any comments
 
01:00:04.870 --> 01:00:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:07.990 --> 01:00:08.000 align:start position:0%
amendment I I'd like to say that we were
 
01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.109 align:start position:0%
amendment I I'd like to say that we were
concerned

01:00:10.109 --> 01:00:10.119 align:start position:0%
concerned
 
01:00:14.190 --> 01:00:14.200 align:start position:0%
that the state was attempting to more or
 
01:00:17.270 --> 01:00:17.280 align:start position:0%
less bully the political
 
01:00:19.950 --> 01:00:19.960 align:start position:0%
subdivisions uh during the lease
 
01:00:22.069 --> 01:00:22.079 align:start position:0%
negotiations and this will give them a
 
01:00:22.079 --> 01:00:22.950 align:start position:0%
negotiations and this will give them a
bit

01:00:22.950 --> 01:00:22.960 align:start position:0%
bit
 
01:00:26.910 --> 01:00:26.920 align:start position:0%
more um
 
01:00:29.109 --> 01:00:29.119 align:start position:0%
I don't know more more standing to to
 
01:00:32.349 --> 01:00:32.359 align:start position:0%
say what the mar the fair price for
 
01:00:36.029 --> 01:00:36.039 align:start position:0%
renting a building is a lot of these are
 
01:00:39.230 --> 01:00:39.240 align:start position:0%
extremely unique I mean how many people
 
01:00:41.309 --> 01:00:41.319 align:start position:0%
want to rent a
 
01:00:44.510 --> 01:00:44.520 align:start position:0%
courthouse but uh if you start with the
 
01:00:47.910 --> 01:00:47.920 align:start position:0%
concept that it's a fair market
 
01:00:52.069 --> 01:00:52.079 align:start position:0%
rate then at least the and utilities and
 
01:00:55.589 --> 01:00:55.599 align:start position:0%
custodial services and so forth are in
 
01:00:59.230 --> 01:00:59.240 align:start position:0%
addition to the basic rate that'll keep
 
01:01:03.630 --> 01:01:03.640 align:start position:0%
the counties and cities from being um
 
01:01:06.510 --> 01:01:06.520 align:start position:0%
forced to subsidize the
 
01:01:09.750 --> 01:01:09.760 align:start position:0%
state and I think that's an important
 
01:01:14.029 --> 01:01:14.039 align:start position:0%
issue anyone out represent BR yes um I
 
01:01:15.549 --> 01:01:15.559 align:start position:0%
have a note that there was a drafting
 
01:01:18.430 --> 01:01:18.440 align:start position:0%
error on the bill but I noticed that the
 
01:01:22.630 --> 01:01:22.640 align:start position:0%
reference the RGA I mean RSA was was
 
01:01:26.510 --> 01:01:26.520 align:start position:0%
eliminated in the amendment and is that
 
01:01:28.510 --> 01:01:28.520 align:start position:0%
because a drafting error yeah that was
 
01:01:30.990 --> 01:01:31.000 align:start position:0%
the drafting error but because it was
 
01:01:32.990 --> 01:01:33.000 align:start position:0%
eliminated I'm thinking it was
 
01:01:34.829 --> 01:01:34.839 align:start position:0%
eliminated because we changed the scope
 
01:01:38.349 --> 01:01:38.359 align:start position:0%
of the bill we changed the scope of the
 
01:01:42.789 --> 01:01:42.799 align:start position:0%
bill to only deal with leases between
 
01:01:45.710 --> 01:01:45.720 align:start position:0%
the state and a political subdivision
 
01:01:48.510 --> 01:01:48.520 align:start position:0%
the original Bill had all leases from
 
01:01:50.829 --> 01:01:50.839 align:start position:0%
the state and we didn't think we needed
 
01:01:53.630 --> 01:01:53.640 align:start position:0%
to protect the private landlords for
 
01:01:57.990 --> 01:01:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:00.630 --> 01:02:00.640 align:start position:0%
from uh what I've heard from from
 
01:02:04.349 --> 01:02:04.359 align:start position:0%
various uh State officials the private
 
01:02:07.190 --> 01:02:07.200 align:start position:0%
landlords do a fine job of negotiating
 
01:02:09.630 --> 01:02:09.640 align:start position:0%
profitable rates with the state
 
01:02:14.109 --> 01:02:14.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:17.109 --> 01:02:17.119 align:start position:0%
okay it's that's their business after
 
01:02:19.910 --> 01:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
all representative uh oh representative
 
01:02:22.109 --> 01:02:22.119 align:start position:0%
daring yeah uh one other change on the
 
01:02:24.870 --> 01:02:24.880 align:start position:0%
bill was that uh with the amendment is
 
01:02:27.390 --> 01:02:27.400 align:start position:0%
that it goes both ways it's not
 
01:02:31.269 --> 01:02:31.279 align:start position:0%
just um the state and the political
 
01:02:33.870 --> 01:02:33.880 align:start position:0%
subdivision it goes both ways so if uh
 
01:02:35.349 --> 01:02:35.359 align:start position:0%
subdivision owns a property and the
 
01:02:38.029 --> 01:02:38.039 align:start position:0%
state's leasing it it's it's okay or if
 
01:02:39.829 --> 01:02:39.839 align:start position:0%
the state has a property and the
 
01:02:41.230 --> 01:02:41.240 align:start position:0%
political subdivision leasing it it's
 
01:02:44.109 --> 01:02:44.119 align:start position:0%
the same deal it's both at um Market

thanks representative

lamb um yes thank you madam chair um
 
01:05:37.190 --> 01:05:37.200 align:start position:0%
there's the issue around how many
 
01:05:41.430 --> 01:05:41.440 align:start position:0%
holidays do we recognize as a state um
 
01:05:43.549 --> 01:05:43.559 align:start position:0%
as we add more and more we sort of
 
01:05:46.109 --> 01:05:46.119 align:start position:0%
dilute the power of each and any history
 
01:05:47.549 --> 01:05:47.559 align:start position:0%
teacher in the state should be well
 
01:05:49.109 --> 01:05:49.119 align:start position:0%
aware of Daniel Webster and already
 
01:05:51.670 --> 01:05:51.680 align:start position:0%
including them um robustly in the
 
01:05:53.390 --> 01:05:53.400 align:start position:0%
education and therefore while I
 
01:05:55.150 --> 01:05:55.160 align:start position:0%
appreciate bringing more attention to
 
01:05:57.750 --> 01:05:57.760 align:start position:0%
Daniel Webster um I also recognize that
 
01:05:59.390 --> 01:05:59.400 align:start position:0%
this should already be happening and
 
01:06:02.390 --> 01:06:02.400 align:start position:0%
adding an additional day um is not going
 
01:06:09.150 --> 01:06:09.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:11.430 --> 01:06:11.440 align:start position:0%
recognition it's been the tradition of
 
01:06:14.789 --> 01:06:14.799 align:start position:0%
this committee not to support special
 
01:06:17.430 --> 01:06:17.440 align:start position:0%
holidays because the state doesn't have
 
01:06:21.109 --> 01:06:21.119 align:start position:0%
a method by which to enact what we ask
 
01:06:21.990 --> 01:06:22.000 align:start position:0%
them to
 
01:06:27.029 --> 01:06:27.039 align:start position:0%
do and until there is such a mechanism
 
01:06:30.910 --> 01:06:30.920 align:start position:0%
um we should continue the tradition and
 
01:06:33.349 --> 01:06:33.359 align:start position:0%
the uh protocol for the division for the
 
01:06:35.829 --> 01:06:35.839 align:start position:0%
committee and I apologize to you
 
01:06:35.839 --> 01:06:37.269 align:start position:0%
committee and I apologize to you
representative

01:06:37.269 --> 01:06:37.279 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:06:40.870 --> 01:06:40.880 align:start position:0%
Tio yeah representative
 
01:06:43.190 --> 01:06:43.200 align:start position:0%
Tio uh I just wanted to say I appreciate
 
01:06:44.829 --> 01:06:44.839 align:start position:0%
the committee's concerns I will be
 
01:06:46.910 --> 01:06:46.920 align:start position:0%
voting against itl because Daniel
 
01:06:49.789 --> 01:06:49.799 align:start position:0%
Webster was from Franklin and I I want
 
01:06:52.990 --> 01:06:53.000 align:start position:0%
to pay respect to him but um I do think
 
01:06:55.150 --> 01:06:55.160 align:start position:0%
that there are better ways out there to
 
01:06:57.109 --> 01:06:57.119 align:start position:0%
um appreciate New Hampshire history and
 
01:06:58.390 --> 01:06:58.400 align:start position:0%
I look forward to working in the
 
01:07:00.390 --> 01:07:00.400 align:start position:0%
legislature to celebrate those in the
 
01:07:03.109 --> 01:07:03.119 align:start position:0%
future good representative Schmidt thank
 
01:07:06.230 --> 01:07:06.240 align:start position:0%
you madam Sher so representative
 
01:07:10.750 --> 01:07:10.760 align:start position:0%
um Daniel Webster is uh unforgotten and
 
01:07:13.750 --> 01:07:13.760 align:start position:0%
those who bump into his statue un
 
01:07:15.870 --> 01:07:15.880 align:start position:0%
knowingly down in front of the state
 
01:07:19.470 --> 01:07:19.480 align:start position:0%
house um will will look up and say who's
 
01:07:24.230 --> 01:07:24.240 align:start position:0%
that guy uh in in the case of people who
 
01:07:26.549 --> 01:07:26.559 align:start position:0%
maybe will be forgotten
 
01:07:30.670 --> 01:07:30.680 align:start position:0%
um in another hundred years um if if
 
01:07:34.230 --> 01:07:34.240 align:start position:0%
there's a if there's cause to want to
 
01:07:36.430 --> 01:07:36.440 align:start position:0%
remember them it's this committee's
 
01:07:39.269 --> 01:07:39.279 align:start position:0%
position that the proclamation by the
 
01:07:42.589 --> 01:07:42.599 align:start position:0%
governor is uh is more likely to to
 
01:07:44.269 --> 01:07:44.279 align:start position:0%
attract some attention in that
 
01:07:48.230 --> 01:07:48.240 align:start position:0%
particular era um as we did with Granny
 
01:07:51.589 --> 01:07:51.599 align:start position:0%
D for example who was a a really
 
01:07:56.230 --> 01:07:56.240 align:start position:0%
outstanding citizen but in 100 years
 
01:07:57.510 --> 01:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
she may be
 
01:07:57.520 --> 01:07:59.190 align:start position:0%
she may be
forgotten

01:07:59.190 --> 01:07:59.200 align:start position:0%
forgotten
 
01:08:02.750 --> 01:08:02.760 align:start position:0%
fortunately uh so to the degree that
 
01:08:04.269 --> 01:08:04.279 align:start position:0%
that would be the case with Daniel
 
01:08:05.990 --> 01:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
Webster I would think we would all be
 
01:08:08.870 --> 01:08:08.880 align:start position:0%
very surprised uh since he's also got a
 
01:08:10.950 --> 01:08:10.960 align:start position:0%
portrait up in the front of the Reps
 
01:08:15.870 --> 01:08:15.880 align:start position:0%
Hall um so that's the reason we don't go
 
01:08:17.950 --> 01:08:17.960 align:start position:0%
for this kind of Bill in this committee
 
01:08:20.669 --> 01:08:20.679 align:start position:0%
thank you yes I'd like to expound on
 
01:08:24.789 --> 01:08:24.799 align:start position:0%
that because we have found that if an a
 
01:08:28.189 --> 01:08:28.199 align:start position:0%
person or a town or an
 
01:08:31.349 --> 01:08:31.359 align:start position:0%
organization best itself to want to
 
01:08:34.829 --> 01:08:34.839 align:start position:0%
create a special day they celebrate it
 
01:08:37.550 --> 01:08:37.560 align:start position:0%
they get the governor to an to announce
 
01:08:41.829 --> 01:08:41.839 align:start position:0%
that day and they perform the uh uh
 
01:08:41.839 --> 01:08:44.590 align:start position:0%
that day and they perform the uh uh
whatever

01:08:44.590 --> 01:08:44.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:47.070 --> 01:08:47.080 align:start position:0%
appropriate actions are required whether
 
01:08:49.789 --> 01:08:49.799 align:start position:0%
it's in the school or the town or
 
01:08:52.630 --> 01:08:52.640 align:start position:0%
putting up a statue of Pana I mean any
 
01:08:55.189 --> 01:08:55.199 align:start position:0%
whatever they're involved but once it
 
01:08:57.189 --> 01:08:57.199 align:start position:0%
gets into statute it's
 
01:08:59.829 --> 01:08:59.839 align:start position:0%
forgotten it's the governor issues a
 
01:09:03.189 --> 01:09:03.199 align:start position:0%
proclamation that nobody is waiting for
 
01:09:06.309 --> 01:09:06.319 align:start position:0%
and nobody does much of anything uh
 
01:09:08.430 --> 01:09:08.440 align:start position:0%
we've had the occasion of holding a
 
01:09:12.510 --> 01:09:12.520 align:start position:0%
hearing on February 14th one year and
 
01:09:15.590 --> 01:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
someone wanted a special day I forget
 
01:09:18.070 --> 01:09:18.080 align:start position:0%
exactly what event it was and I asked
 
01:09:20.510 --> 01:09:20.520 align:start position:0%
her do you know what today is and well
 
01:09:23.910 --> 01:09:23.920 align:start position:0%
of course it's Valentine's Day no it's
 
01:09:26.149 --> 01:09:26.159 align:start position:0%
the state holiday of genital heart
 
01:09:29.829 --> 01:09:29.839 align:start position:0%
disease day and everybody oh wow no one
 
01:09:33.470 --> 01:09:33.480 align:start position:0%
knew that because it was it had been
 
01:09:35.950 --> 01:09:35.960 align:start position:0%
lobbied for and people had pushed for it
 
01:09:37.789 --> 01:09:37.799 align:start position:0%
and it was placed into the statute and
 
01:09:39.189 --> 01:09:39.199 align:start position:0%
that was
 
01:09:43.430 --> 01:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
it so I'm very much against establishing
 
01:09:47.910 --> 01:09:47.920 align:start position:0%
holidays in statute
 
01:09:51.309 --> 01:09:51.319 align:start position:0%
represent Madam chair did you say best
 
01:09:52.669 --> 01:09:52.679 align:start position:0%
themselves I'm going to have to go to my
 
01:09:56.110 --> 01:09:56.120 align:start position:0%
Websters on that one uh
 
01:09:59.709 --> 01:09:59.719 align:start position:0%
I we always have some vocabulary lessons
 
01:10:02.950 --> 01:10:02.960 align:start position:0%
in every exact session uh indeed uh a
 
01:10:05.709 --> 01:10:05.719 align:start position:0%
couple things first as I understand the
 
01:10:07.470 --> 01:10:07.480 align:start position:0%
choice of date was right after Martin
 
01:10:09.229 --> 01:10:09.239 align:start position:0%
Luther King day wasn't
 
01:10:11.830 --> 01:10:11.840 align:start position:0%
it that wasn't the intent that's just
 
01:10:13.630 --> 01:10:13.640 align:start position:0%
happens to be his
 
01:10:17.229 --> 01:10:17.239 align:start position:0%
birthday okay I think that that tends to
 
01:10:21.669 --> 01:10:21.679 align:start position:0%
be in the penumbra of uh Martin Luther
 
01:10:24.990 --> 01:10:25.000 align:start position:0%
King I'd like to vote for it but here's
 
01:10:28.110 --> 01:10:28.120 align:start position:0%
the deal uh he's conspicuous by his
 
01:10:29.990 --> 01:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
absence I mean if we're going to do this
 
01:10:34.110 --> 01:10:34.120 align:start position:0%
for the other people uh the forebears of
 
01:10:38.390 --> 01:10:38.400 align:start position:0%
of our state we would to include him but
 
01:10:42.189 --> 01:10:42.199 align:start position:0%
uh no not I don't know I I'll Pro I may
 
01:10:44.350 --> 01:10:44.360 align:start position:0%
weaken at some point but that's my my
 
01:10:47.310 --> 01:10:47.320 align:start position:0%
thinking i' yes and I would have to say
 
01:10:50.630 --> 01:10:50.640 align:start position:0%
that any um history teacher that didn't
 
01:10:52.910 --> 01:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
know about Daniel
 
01:10:54.910 --> 01:10:54.920 align:start position:0%

deliberate but that that was put into
 
01:11:18.990 --> 01:11:19.000 align:start position:0%

01:12:34.790 --> 01:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
complete the set and go with a soft no
 
01:12:38.189 --> 01:12:38.199 align:start position:0%
soft no and the chair
 
01:12:41.790 --> 01:12:41.800 align:start position:0%
yes four 12
 
01:12:45.310 --> 01:12:45.320 align:start position:0%
to4 all right the motion passes 12 to4
 
01:12:49.750 --> 01:12:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:55.350 --> 01:12:55.360 align:start position:0%
Report what yes no okay anyone else m I
 
01:12:57.910 --> 01:12:57.920 align:start position:0%
have a question then are is this going
 
01:12:59.870 --> 01:12:59.880 align:start position:0%
to get floor fought are we going to are
 
01:13:02.070 --> 01:13:02.080 align:start position:0%
we going to fight this on the floor well
 
01:13:03.870 --> 01:13:03.880 align:start position:0%
that's why I'm doing the questions in
 
01:13:06.070 --> 01:13:06.080 align:start position:0%
order the first question is is there
 
01:13:08.669 --> 01:13:08.679 align:start position:0%
going to be a Minority Report if there
 
01:13:10.430 --> 01:13:10.440 align:start position:0%
is it is definitely going to be on the
 
01:13:12.709 --> 01:13:12.719 align:start position:0%
regular calender right and I think
 
01:13:14.270 --> 01:13:14.280 align:start position:0%
that's something that we should
 
01:13:16.510 --> 01:13:16.520 align:start position:0%
probably think about right now are we
 
01:13:17.990 --> 01:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
going to actually floor fight this
 
01:13:19.149 --> 01:13:19.159 align:start position:0%
because if we're not it should just
 
01:13:21.189 --> 01:13:21.199 align:start position:0%
probably go on consent if I can make a
 
01:13:23.669 --> 01:13:23.679 align:start position:0%
comment I think that that really is up
 
01:13:26.709 --> 01:13:26.719 align:start position:0%
to the four people have voted no yes and
 
01:13:29.590 --> 01:13:29.600 align:start position:0%
so if one of them chooses to write a
 
01:13:32.270 --> 01:13:32.280 align:start position:0%
Minority Report then it's on the cons
 
01:13:33.790 --> 01:13:33.800 align:start position:0%
it's on the regular calendar if you
 
01:13:36.189 --> 01:13:36.199 align:start position:0%
choose not to it's on the consent
 
01:13:38.750 --> 01:13:38.760 align:start position:0%
calendar and we can give you like a few
 
01:13:41.550 --> 01:13:41.560 align:start position:0%
minutes to think about it
 
01:13:44.310 --> 01:13:44.320 align:start position:0%
but yes representative
 
01:13:46.990 --> 01:13:47.000 align:start position:0%
tuo Madam chair I would just like to say
 
01:13:48.910 --> 01:13:48.920 align:start position:0%
that um I would prefer that this go on
 
01:13:51.149 --> 01:13:51.159 align:start position:0%
consense so I'd ask my colleagues who um
 
01:13:54.149 --> 01:13:54.159 align:start position:0%
also voted in the negative to um to
 
01:13:56.510 --> 01:13:56.520 align:start position:0%
respect that if they'd like that's and
 
01:13:58.550 --> 01:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
that's why I'm asking if they do want to
 
01:14:01.229 --> 01:14:01.239 align:start position:0%
write a Minority
 
01:14:03.830 --> 01:14:03.840 align:start position:0%
Report no doesn't it look a little funny
 
01:14:08.830 --> 01:14:08.840 align:start position:0%
to have a a for vote uh it happens I
 
01:14:08.840 --> 01:14:09.750 align:start position:0%
to have a a for vote uh it happens I
don't

01:14:09.750 --> 01:14:09.760 align:start position:0%
don't
 
01:14:09.760 --> 01:14:11.550 align:start position:0%
don't
know

01:14:11.550 --> 01:14:11.560 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:14:14.030 --> 01:14:14.040 align:start position:0%
don't all right representative Schmidt
 
01:14:18.629 --> 01:14:18.639 align:start position:0%
is objecting to consent I I see that no
 
01:14:18.639 --> 01:14:19.510 align:start position:0%
is objecting to consent I I see that no
one

01:14:19.510 --> 01:14:19.520 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:14:22.350 --> 01:14:22.360 align:start position:0%
is planning to write a Minority Report
 
01:14:23.790 --> 01:14:23.800 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:14:26.070 --> 01:14:26.080 align:start position:0%
correct but we can still have a Voice
 
01:14:29.030 --> 01:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
vote on the thing exactly okay so this
 
01:14:31.270 --> 01:14:31.280 align:start position:0%
this will go on the regular
 
01:14:34.910 --> 01:14:34.920 align:start position:0%
calendar and no no Minority Report
 
01:14:38.189 --> 01:14:38.199 align:start position:0%
representative ree may we defer to the
 
01:14:40.229 --> 01:14:40.239 align:start position:0%
bill sponsor on whether or not he wants
 
01:14:42.830 --> 01:14:42.840 align:start position:0%
a floor fight on this he has said he
 
01:14:46.550 --> 01:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't doesn't want it to be fact he
 
01:14:49.110 --> 01:14:49.120 align:start position:0%
asked for Beyond consent correct okay so
 
01:14:52.430 --> 01:14:52.440 align:start position:0%
12 to4 regardless I there was support
 
01:14:55.550 --> 01:14:55.560 align:start position:0%
for rento's Bill but I I don't don't see
 
01:14:58.149 --> 01:14:58.159 align:start position:0%
bringing this to the floor for a floor
 
01:15:02.470 --> 01:15:02.480 align:start position:0%
battle with a discussion debate when
 
01:15:04.590 --> 01:15:04.600 align:start position:0%
when the bill sponsor doesn't want that
 
01:15:09.430 --> 01:15:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:12.070 --> 01:15:12.080 align:start position:0%
a representative Schmidt has said it
 
01:15:14.030 --> 01:15:14.040 align:start position:0%
should not be on consent and therefore
 
01:15:16.629 --> 01:15:16.639 align:start position:0%
it will not be on consent got four votes
 
01:15:19.750 --> 01:15:19.760 align:start position:0%
is too many to have on consent I either
 
01:15:22.110 --> 01:15:22.120 align:start position:0%
way you're objecting represent Pearson's
 
01:15:24.510 --> 01:15:24.520 align:start position:0%
concerned yes represent would it be
 
01:15:26.590 --> 01:15:26.600 align:start position:0%
possible for to change my vote um at
 
01:15:28.470 --> 01:15:28.480 align:start position:0%
this point no at this point it doesn't
 
01:15:31.110 --> 01:15:31.120 align:start position:0%
you could do a motion to reconsider will
 
01:15:33.110 --> 01:15:33.120 align:start position:0%
it will just come up it will just come
 
01:15:35.350 --> 01:15:35.360 align:start position:0%
up it'll get voted on there won't be any
 
01:15:40.229 --> 01:15:40.239 align:start position:0%
fight all up Daniel portrait on the
 
01:15:42.390 --> 01:15:42.400 align:start position:0%
house remember
 
01:15:45.590 --> 01:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
him one more time I think if we don't
 
01:15:47.310 --> 01:15:47.320 align:start position:0%
plan to argue it we can leave it on the
 
01:15:49.629 --> 01:15:49.639 align:start position:0%
regular calendar and
 
01:15:49.639 --> 01:15:52.830 align:start position:0%
regular calendar and
just

01:15:52.830 --> 01:15:52.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:59.390 --> 01:15:59.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:01.430 --> 01:16:01.440 align:start position:0%
Daniel Madam chair I think we're ready
 
01:16:04.310 --> 01:16:04.320 align:start position:0%
to move on thank you all right we are
 
01:16:07.430 --> 01:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
moving on to the last bill we have which
 
01:16:09.430 --> 01:16:09.440 align:start position:0%
is House Bill
 
01:16:13.310 --> 01:16:13.320 align:start position:0%
610 and I I have an amendment
 
01:16:13.320 --> 01:16:14.950 align:start position:0%
610 and I I have an amendment
that

01:16:14.950 --> 01:16:14.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:16:17.470 --> 01:16:17.480 align:start position:0%
incorporates the office of the consumer
 
01:16:20.870 --> 01:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
advocate in the department of energy for
 
01:16:20.880 --> 01:16:22.430 align:start position:0%
advocate in the department of energy for
your

01:16:22.430 --> 01:16:22.440 align:start position:0%
your
 
01:16:26.709 --> 01:16:26.719 align:start position:0%
consideration but after re reading this
 
01:16:31.350 --> 01:16:31.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:31.360 --> 01:16:36.030 align:start position:0%
 
retain

01:16:36.030 --> 01:16:36.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:40.709 --> 01:16:40.719 align:start position:0%
okay I move to retain House Bill
 
01:16:40.719 --> 01:16:42.310 align:start position:0%
okay I move to retain House Bill
610

01:16:42.310 --> 01:16:42.320 align:start position:0%
610
 
01:16:42.320 --> 01:16:47.390 align:start position:0%
610
and

01:16:47.390 --> 01:16:47.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:50.189 --> 01:16:50.199 align:start position:0%
I'll the cons the current consumer
 
01:16:52.830 --> 01:16:52.840 align:start position:0%
Advocate obviously has a lot
 
01:16:57.070 --> 01:16:57.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:01.070 --> 01:17:01.080 align:start position:0%
but I was concerned that the utilities
 
01:17:03.910 --> 01:17:03.920 align:start position:0%
that he's supposed to be representing
 
01:17:08.189 --> 01:17:08.199 align:start position:0%
consumers against were all supporting
 
01:17:11.830 --> 01:17:11.840 align:start position:0%
him that struck me as something a little
 
01:17:16.189 --> 01:17:16.199 align:start position:0%
weird um I was also concerned that the
 
01:17:19.790 --> 01:17:19.800 align:start position:0%
chair of the science and energy
 
01:17:22.950 --> 01:17:22.960 align:start position:0%
committee was concerned that the scope
 
01:17:26.750 --> 01:17:26.760 align:start position:0%
of the consumer Advocates activity ities
 
01:17:29.790 --> 01:17:29.800 align:start position:0%
was either not properly defined in
 
01:17:29.800 --> 01:17:31.110 align:start position:0%
was either not properly defined in
statute

01:17:31.110 --> 01:17:31.120 align:start position:0%
statute
 
01:17:34.629 --> 01:17:34.639 align:start position:0%
or he was working outside of the scope
 
01:17:36.510 --> 01:17:36.520 align:start position:0%
and he thought that that needed to be
 
01:17:39.629 --> 01:17:39.639 align:start position:0%
fixed that's not our our wheelhouse
 
01:17:41.590 --> 01:17:41.600 align:start position:0%
really we don't we don't deal with him
 
01:17:44.110 --> 01:17:44.120 align:start position:0%
we don't know what he does but I have a
 
01:17:48.149 --> 01:17:48.159 align:start position:0%
lot of concerns about this and so I
 
01:17:52.189 --> 01:17:52.199 align:start position:0%
suggested retaining it so that we can
 
01:17:55.270 --> 01:17:55.280 align:start position:0%
find out what's going on the the hearing
 
01:17:57.790 --> 01:17:57.800 align:start position:0%
was a very well
 
01:18:01.390 --> 01:18:01.400 align:start position:0%
orchestrated uh evidence of support but
 
01:18:03.350 --> 01:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
like I said I was concerned that the
 
01:18:05.470 --> 01:18:05.480 align:start position:0%
utilities weren't
 
01:18:08.189 --> 01:18:08.199 align:start position:0%
saying God this this this office is a
 
01:18:10.030 --> 01:18:10.040 align:start position:0%
nuisance they bother us they keep us
 
01:18:12.470 --> 01:18:12.480 align:start position:0%
from making our proper and appropriate
 
01:18:14.590 --> 01:18:14.600 align:start position:0%
profits but they didn't say that they
 
01:18:16.629 --> 01:18:16.639 align:start position:0%
said he's a good guy and he works hard I
 
01:18:16.639 --> 01:18:17.390 align:start position:0%
said he's a good guy and he works hard I
mean

01:18:17.390 --> 01:18:17.400 align:start position:0%
mean
 
01:18:20.750 --> 01:18:20.760 align:start position:0%
that's um I was concerned so I I think
 
01:18:24.350 --> 01:18:24.360 align:start position:0%
we ought to at least hold on to it for a
 
01:18:26.229 --> 01:18:26.239 align:start position:0%
little while while and
 
01:18:29.189 --> 01:18:29.199 align:start position:0%
say is the consumer Advocate doing the
 
01:18:31.110 --> 01:18:31.120 align:start position:0%
right thing and
 
01:18:35.510 --> 01:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
is a not even barely administratively
 
01:18:38.390 --> 01:18:38.400 align:start position:0%
attached the department of energy the
 
01:18:41.149 --> 01:18:41.159 align:start position:0%
right location in the state structure
 
01:18:45.750 --> 01:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
for it and that's um that was that's my
 
01:18:47.510 --> 01:18:47.520 align:start position:0%
point representative Lan you wish to
 
01:18:50.149 --> 01:18:50.159 align:start position:0%
speak to it uh yes thank you madam chair
 
01:18:52.709 --> 01:18:52.719 align:start position:0%
um I agree I think that one of the
 
01:18:54.110 --> 01:18:54.120 align:start position:0%
things that I always look for is making
 
01:18:55.390 --> 01:18:55.400 align:start position:0%
sure that somebody is fighting for the
 
01:18:57.629 --> 01:18:57.639 align:start position:0%
little guy and the fact that the people
 
01:18:59.390 --> 01:18:59.400 align:start position:0%
who the office of the consumer Advocate
 
01:19:00.870 --> 01:19:00.880 align:start position:0%
is supposed to stand up for the little
 
01:19:02.750 --> 01:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
guy against were supporting the
 
01:19:04.830 --> 01:19:04.840 align:start position:0%
continuation of the office which just
 
01:19:06.270 --> 01:19:06.280 align:start position:0%
has me concerned I think that if we
 
01:19:09.270 --> 01:19:09.280 align:start position:0%
retain this we can just sort of look and
 
01:19:11.990 --> 01:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
make sure that they are they do have the
 
01:19:14.270 --> 01:19:14.280 align:start position:0%
tools that they need in order to make
 
01:19:15.830 --> 01:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
sure that they're representing the
 
01:19:18.189 --> 01:19:18.199 align:start position:0%
residential rate holders and I think
 
01:19:19.590 --> 01:19:19.600 align:start position:0%
it's I think it's important to retain
 
01:19:22.229 --> 01:19:22.239 align:start position:0%
this just because just because right now
 
01:19:23.790 --> 01:19:23.800 align:start position:0%
we're facing some pretty high energy
 
01:19:27.070 --> 01:19:27.080 align:start position:0%
costs and we need to make sure that um
 
01:19:28.950 --> 01:19:28.960 align:start position:0%
either this the consumer advocate's
 
01:19:31.350 --> 01:19:31.360 align:start position:0%
doing what they need to do and uh
 
01:19:33.350 --> 01:19:33.360 align:start position:0%
determine whether it's an effective job
 
01:19:35.030 --> 01:19:35.040 align:start position:0%
and if they need other tools or if it's
 
01:19:37.310 --> 01:19:37.320 align:start position:0%
simply um something that's necessary to
 
01:19:37.320 --> 01:19:38.669 align:start position:0%
simply um something that's necessary to
continue

01:19:38.669 --> 01:19:38.679 align:start position:0%
continue
 
01:19:41.390 --> 01:19:41.400 align:start position:0%
with anyone else have a
 
01:19:44.510 --> 01:19:44.520 align:start position:0%
comite it is possible for both teams to
 
01:19:47.669 --> 01:19:47.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:53.470 --> 01:19:53.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:57.110 --> 01:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:00.750 --> 01:20:00.760 align:start position:0%
any other comments questions
 
01:20:03.430 --> 01:20:03.440 align:start position:0%
concerns that present
 
01:20:06.229 --> 01:20:06.239 align:start position:0%
Schmid it can't do any harm to look at
 
01:20:07.910 --> 01:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
this a little bit more that's all you're
 
01:20:13.510 --> 01:20:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:16.870 --> 01:20:16.880 align:start position:0%
