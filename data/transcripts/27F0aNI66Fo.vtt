00:06:54.469 --> 00:06:54.479 align:start position:0%
and working on bail reform
 
00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:56.400 align:start position:0%
uh most notably judge kelly helped
 
00:06:59.110 --> 00:06:59.120 align:start position:0%
create the circuit court in 2011 which
 
00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:01.360 align:start position:0%
then chief justice robert lynn noted was
 
00:07:04.629 --> 00:07:04.639 align:start position:0%
quote a herculean task end quote
 
00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:06.080 align:start position:0%
throughout his various roles in the
 
00:07:07.909 --> 00:07:07.919 align:start position:0%
judicial system judge kelly has left an
 
00:07:09.909 --> 00:07:09.919 align:start position:0%
indelible mark and earned the respect of
 
00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:12.400 align:start position:0%
staff judges and other stakeholders at
 
00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:13.520 align:start position:0%
the court
 
00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:14.880 align:start position:0%
he helped define the role of an
 
00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:16.720 align:start position:0%
administrative judge in responding to
 
00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:18.720 align:start position:0%
citizens and other stakeholders who had
 
00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
less than positive experiences within
 
00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:22.400 align:start position:0%
the judicial system
 
00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:24.240 align:start position:0%
i believe judge kelly exhibits all the
 
00:07:25.749 --> 00:07:25.759 align:start position:0%
attributes that one would look for in a
 
00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:26.880 align:start position:0%
great judge
 
00:07:28.629 --> 00:07:28.639 align:start position:0%
i hope the committee will look favorably
 
00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:30.560 align:start position:0%
upon this bill and vote the bill ought
 
00:07:31.749 --> 00:07:31.759 align:start position:0%
to pass
 
00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:33.360 align:start position:0%

00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
seeing none i would

00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:22.240 align:start position:0%
representative gordon i i say that
 
00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:33.360 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
00:08:36.790 --> 00:08:36.800 align:start position:0%
chairman graham members of the committee
 
00:08:39.509 --> 00:08:39.519 align:start position:0%
thank you for your patience
 
00:08:43.029 --> 00:08:43.039 align:start position:0%
i also uh speak in favor of uh senate
 
00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
bill 28 and naming the courtroom after
 
00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:48.160 align:start position:0%
judge kelly
 
00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:51.040 align:start position:0%
i served under him as a circuit court
 
00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:53.120 align:start position:0%
judge for many years
 
00:08:55.829 --> 00:08:55.839 align:start position:0%
but even before i was a judge he was the
 
00:08:58.150 --> 00:08:58.160 align:start position:0%
administrative judge of the court
 
00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:00.160 align:start position:0%
and i saw the court evolve over many
 
00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:01.269 align:start position:0%
and i saw the court evolve over many
years

00:09:01.269 --> 00:09:01.279 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:09:04.949 --> 00:09:04.959 align:start position:0%
when i first started practicing law
 
00:09:04.959 --> 00:09:06.230 align:start position:0%
when i first started practicing law
the

00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:06.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:08.000 align:start position:0%
the circuit court and particularly the
 
00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:09.360 align:start position:0%
district court
 
00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:11.200 align:start position:0%
was uh
 
00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:15.680 align:start position:0%
uh at at best uh disheveled it was uh
 
00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:18.080 align:start position:0%
basically made up of part-time judges
 
00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:19.760 align:start position:0%
all over the state
 
00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:22.640 align:start position:0%
and if you were a practicing attorney
 
00:09:24.949 --> 00:09:24.959 align:start position:0%
it depended on what court you went to
 
00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:27.360 align:start position:0%
what judge you saw in order the type of
 
00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:29.360 align:start position:0%
law you were going to type a judgment or
 
00:09:31.269 --> 00:09:31.279 align:start position:0%
law you were going to receive
 
00:09:33.509 --> 00:09:33.519 align:start position:0%
and when judge kelly was appointed the
 
00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:35.600 align:start position:0%
administrative judge
 
00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:37.200 align:start position:0%
he did a number of things he
 
00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:39.760 align:start position:0%
standardized practices
 
00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:42.720 align:start position:0%
he made it so that we had
 
00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:45.360 align:start position:0%
full-time judges judges who wanted to be
 
00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:46.550 align:start position:0%
full-time judges judges who wanted to be
judges

00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
judges
 
00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:48.080 align:start position:0%
who weren't doing that just to build
 
00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
their resume but because they wanted to
 
00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:52.320 align:start position:0%
do it as a career
 
00:09:56.070 --> 00:09:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:57.990 --> 00:09:58.000 align:start position:0%
senator guide has also mentioned some of
 
00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:01.600 align:start position:0%
the other things that he's done
 
00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:04.480 align:start position:0%
such as adopting the family court where
 
00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:07.360 align:start position:0%
we actually had family court judges who
 
00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
wanted to do family court cases
 
00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:12.640 align:start position:0%
which was a change
 
00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
uh he also
 
00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:18.240 align:start position:0%
prospered the court in the sense that he
 
00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
saw that we had new courtrooms
 
00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
new courthouses built across the state
 
00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:26.560 align:start position:0%
and we weren't having
 
00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:28.720 align:start position:0%
our courts held in places like in
 
00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:30.880 align:start position:0%
franklin where you did it in the old
 
00:10:33.509 --> 00:10:33.519 align:start position:0%
opera house on the theater
 
00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:35.360 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:10:38.069 --> 00:10:38.079 align:start position:0%
he um he's done a great deal to prosper
 
00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:40.720 align:start position:0%
the court uh and uh probably the one of
 
00:10:43.269 --> 00:10:43.279 align:start position:0%
the most important things he did was uh
 
00:10:45.269 --> 00:10:45.279 align:start position:0%
among the last things he did and that
 
00:10:48.949 --> 00:10:48.959 align:start position:0%
was to do bring it bring the court into
 
00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:52.160 align:start position:0%
uh the 21st century electronically so
 
00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:55.200 align:start position:0%
that people could electronically file
 
00:10:57.990 --> 00:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
and people did not have to
 
00:10:59.670 --> 00:10:59.680 align:start position:0%
go through the
 
00:11:01.509 --> 00:11:01.519 align:start position:0%
the formal process
 
00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
of appearing for everything that needs
 
00:11:05.269 --> 00:11:05.279 align:start position:0%
to be done
 
00:11:08.389 --> 00:11:08.399 align:start position:0%
and in short i i can't think of anyone
 
00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:10.640 align:start position:0%
who was more worthy of having a
 
00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:13.040 align:start position:0%
courtroom named after him frankly
 
00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:15.040 align:start position:0%
in my personal opinion i think the
 
00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:17.360 align:start position:0%
courthouse in plymouth ought to be named
 
00:11:18.389 --> 00:11:18.399 align:start position:0%
after him
 
00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:21.440 align:start position:0%
uh but uh naming a courtroom uh
 
00:11:23.269 --> 00:11:23.279 align:start position:0%
certainly would be an honor and i
 
00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:26.480 align:start position:0%
certainly would encourage you to do so
 
00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:35.600 align:start position:0%
seeing um thank you
 
00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:38.470 align:start position:0%
seeing um thank you
um

00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:40.389 --> 00:11:40.399 align:start position:0%
if we can bring um
 
00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:08.069 align:start position:0%
 
hey

00:12:08.069 --> 00:12:08.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
there okay whenever you're ready
 
00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
good morning uh
 
00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:14.000 align:start position:0%
mr chairman and members of the committee
 
00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for allowing me to speak
 
00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
here today
 
00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
in support of senate bill 28
 
00:12:23.269 --> 00:12:23.279 align:start position:0%
naming the primary courtroom of the
 
00:12:25.269 --> 00:12:25.279 align:start position:0%
plymouth circuit courthouse
 
00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:27.600 align:start position:0%
to commemorate the remarkable career of
 
00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:30.560 align:start position:0%
the honorable edwin w kelly
 
00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
i've had the distinct honor of serving
 
00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:35.440 align:start position:0%
as a judge in the district and now
 
00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:38.560 align:start position:0%
circuit court for over 32 years
 
00:12:40.629 --> 00:12:40.639 align:start position:0%
and most of that time
 
00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:43.120 align:start position:0%
for over two decades i sat
 
00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:45.200 align:start position:0%
in the very courthouse that is subject
 
00:12:47.269 --> 00:12:47.279 align:start position:0%
to this bill
 
00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
this afforded me not only an opportunity
 
00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:52.000 align:start position:0%
to work closely with judge kelly but
 
00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
also to observe him as he carried out
 
00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
many of his other duties as
 
00:12:59.670 --> 00:12:59.680 align:start position:0%
administrative judge
 
00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:01.600 align:start position:0%
i urge you to support this bill for the
 
00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:03.200 align:start position:0%
simple reason
 
00:13:05.269 --> 00:13:05.279 align:start position:0%
that judge kelly has earned this
 
00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:08.720 align:start position:0%
recognition based on his contributions
 
00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
to the people of new hampshire
 
00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:13.440 align:start position:0%
as the first administrative judge
 
00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:15.440 align:start position:0%
of what was the district and municipal
 
00:13:18.389 --> 00:13:18.399 align:start position:0%
court and is now the circuit court
 
00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:20.560 align:start position:0%
over the two and a half decades that
 
00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
judge kelly served in that role he
 
00:13:24.949 --> 00:13:24.959 align:start position:0%
defined the position
 
00:13:27.190 --> 00:13:27.200 align:start position:0%
as he guided the court into the modern
 
00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:28.790 align:start position:0%
as he guided the court into the modern
era

00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
era
 
00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:30.880 align:start position:0%
in my humble opinion
 
00:13:32.949 --> 00:13:32.959 align:start position:0%
as new hampshire's first administrative
 
00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:35.120 align:start position:0%
judge of the circuit court
 
00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:38.720 align:start position:0%
edwin w kelly did more to provide fair
 
00:13:41.350 --> 00:13:41.360 align:start position:0%
and efficient access to justice
 
00:13:43.269 --> 00:13:43.279 align:start position:0%
for the citizens of new hampshire than
 
00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
any other individual who's ever served
 
00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:48.720 align:start position:0%
in the judicial system
 
00:13:51.509 --> 00:13:51.519 align:start position:0%
given my limited time here today
 
00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:52.800 align:start position:0%
i'm not
 
00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:55.600 align:start position:0%
able to specifically enumerate
 
00:13:58.870 --> 00:13:58.880 align:start position:0%
the long list of major accomplishments
 
00:14:01.509 --> 00:14:01.519 align:start position:0%
uh that judge kelly was able to
 
00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:03.760 align:start position:0%
achieve during his tenure
 
00:14:06.069 --> 00:14:06.079 align:start position:0%
but let me summarize by saying that
 
00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:08.160 align:start position:0%
through his steadfast commitment to the
 
00:14:10.949 --> 00:14:10.959 align:start position:0%
people in new hampshire
 
00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:13.920 align:start position:0%
he made the court more efficient
 
00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:15.760 align:start position:0%
saving the citizens of new hampshire
 
00:14:17.509 --> 00:14:17.519 align:start position:0%
literally hundreds of thousands of
 
00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
dollars each year
 
00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:21.760 align:start position:0%
through his tireless efforts and

and anybody who has been on a planning
 
00:22:56.390 --> 00:22:56.400 align:start position:0%
board or in local government knows that
 
00:22:59.110 --> 00:22:59.120 align:start position:0%
there can be many challenges
 
00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:00.070 align:start position:0%
there can be many challenges
and

00:23:00.070 --> 00:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:23:03.029 --> 00:23:03.039 align:start position:0%
among those challenges was
 
00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
how to resolve a traffic issue at the
 
00:23:07.590 --> 00:23:07.600 align:start position:0%
intersection of
 
00:23:10.710 --> 00:23:10.720 align:start position:0%

00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:12.149 align:start position:0%
county road and newport road
um

00:23:12.149 --> 00:23:12.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:14.549 --> 00:23:14.559 align:start position:0%
at the time that she suggested putting a
 
00:23:16.789 --> 00:23:16.799 align:start position:0%
roundabout there it was a very
 
00:23:16.799 --> 00:23:18.549 align:start position:0%
roundabout there it was a very
controversial

00:23:18.549 --> 00:23:18.559 align:start position:0%
controversial
 
00:23:20.230 --> 00:23:20.240 align:start position:0%
um issue
 
00:23:22.630 --> 00:23:22.640 align:start position:0%
roundabouts really weren't uh
 
00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:24.880 align:start position:0%
well thought of across the board as
 
00:23:27.029 --> 00:23:27.039 align:start position:0%
opposed to traffic lights or just
 
00:23:29.190 --> 00:23:29.200 align:start position:0%
sitting at a stop sign
 
00:23:32.390 --> 00:23:32.400 align:start position:0%
but her um recommendation was innovative
 
00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
and bold for the time and she uh saw the
 
00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:39.760 align:start position:0%
future and she worked very hard to bring
 
00:23:42.149 --> 00:23:42.159 align:start position:0%
it to fruition in the town of new london
 
00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:43.840 align:start position:0%
and i think
 
00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
even though for those people that live
 
00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:48.320 align:start position:0%
in more urban areas
 
00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
the backups might be uh not so much for
 
00:23:55.350 --> 00:23:55.360 align:start position:0%
us it was a great uh a great thing so we
 
00:23:59.110 --> 00:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
appreciated her efforts
 
00:24:01.909 --> 00:24:01.919 align:start position:0%
um after new london she was assistant
 
00:24:05.190 --> 00:24:05.200 align:start position:0%
town manager in hanover she was the town
 
00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:06.480 align:start position:0%
manager in
 
00:24:08.710 --> 00:24:08.720 align:start position:0%
bedford and she ultimately served as the
 
00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:10.960 align:start position:0%
sullivan county manager
 
00:24:13.990 --> 00:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
she had to retire early
 
00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
after about a year when she was
 
00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:21.200 align:start position:0%
diagnosed with als at age 45 which
 
00:24:24.390 --> 00:24:24.400 align:start position:0%
was tragic needless to say
 
00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:26.480 align:start position:0%
during her stellar career she was
 
00:24:29.029 --> 00:24:29.039 align:start position:0%
identified as a rising star in the union
 
00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:32.720 align:start position:0%

00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:38.320 align:start position:0%
management association she was active in
 
00:24:41.350 --> 00:24:41.360 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire municipal association
 
00:24:43.750 --> 00:24:43.760 align:start position:0%
she was recognized as county manager of
 
00:24:47.190 --> 00:24:47.200 align:start position:0%
the year in 2016. she was a low leader
 
00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:48.480 align:start position:0%
in rotary
 
00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
and in 2017 she received the raymond s
 
00:24:55.830 --> 00:24:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:58.830 --> 00:24:58.840 align:start position:0%
jessie turns 51
 
00:25:02.310 --> 00:25:02.320 align:start position:0%
shortly she's battled als valiantly as
 
00:25:04.470 --> 00:25:04.480 align:start position:0%
she has fought for the good
 
00:25:07.269 --> 00:25:07.279 align:start position:0%
not only of the citizens of our
 
00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
town but for the region
 
00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
and for the state
 
00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:15.760 align:start position:0%
at every opportunity that she could
 
00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:17.840 align:start position:0%
i'd like to just read a couple of words
 
00:25:21.029 --> 00:25:21.039 align:start position:0%
that she wrote uh when she was nominated
 
00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:25.200 align:start position:0%
for 40 under 40 for the union leader
 
00:25:28.230 --> 00:25:28.240 align:start position:0%

for those who live within its boundaries
 
00:25:49.029 --> 00:25:49.039 align:start position:0%
and even though change can be slow at
 
00:25:52.789 --> 00:25:52.799 align:start position:0%
times the rewards are worth the effort
 
00:25:56.390 --> 00:25:56.400 align:start position:0%
the hardest days are often from
 
00:26:01.830 --> 00:26:01.840 align:start position:0%

in some of my previous terms as

delegation chair
 
00:27:28.149 --> 00:27:28.159 align:start position:0%
she was very innovative she helped
 
00:27:31.029 --> 00:27:31.039 align:start position:0%
acquire more land uh vicinity where a
 
00:27:33.350 --> 00:27:33.360 align:start position:0%
lot of our county landed and as a result
 
00:27:35.990 --> 00:27:36.000 align:start position:0%

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:37.110 align:start position:0%
of those efforts we turned that that
area

00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:37.120 align:start position:0%
area
 
00:27:39.510 --> 00:27:39.520 align:start position:0%

that's an achievement
 
00:27:45.350 --> 00:27:45.360 align:start position:0%
that it was you know like no other

problem did
 
00:27:49.029 --> 00:27:49.039 align:start position:0%
so i found to be very energetic

innovative and up to the challenges of
 
00:27:55.430 --> 00:27:55.440 align:start position:0%
trying to manage in small rural counties
 
00:27:57.350 --> 00:27:57.360 align:start position:0%
and i want to say in conclusion that
 
00:27:58.950 --> 00:27:58.960 align:start position:0%
when your time is done that you have to

00:31:18.230 --> 00:31:18.240 align:start position:0%
information from this committee i don't
 
00:31:21.029 --> 00:31:21.039 align:start position:0%

00:31:21.039 --> 00:31:22.310 align:start position:0%
know i i checked into it with leadership
yesterday

00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:22.320 align:start position:0%
yesterday
 
00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:24.240 align:start position:0%
and i found out it may be going to an
 
00:31:26.470 --> 00:31:26.480 align:start position:0%
email that hasn't been activated i get
 
00:31:28.470 --> 00:31:28.480 align:start position:0%
notices of other things
 
00:31:30.389 --> 00:31:30.399 align:start position:0%
but i do not have the amendment could
 
00:31:32.870 --> 00:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
you could somebody from the committee
 
00:31:35.029 --> 00:31:35.039 align:start position:0%
explain to me exactly what this
 
00:31:37.190 --> 00:31:37.200 align:start position:0%
amendment does in that
 
00:31:38.789 --> 00:31:38.799 align:start position:0%
does it replace
 
00:31:41.269 --> 00:31:41.279 align:start position:0%
uh the existing wording in senate bill
 
00:31:43.590 --> 00:31:43.600 align:start position:0%
28 or does it just add
 
00:31:46.630 --> 00:31:46.640 align:start position:0%
and if it's not lengthy could it could
 
00:31:48.870 --> 00:31:48.880 align:start position:0%
it be possible that the amendment be
 
00:31:51.190 --> 00:31:51.200 align:start position:0%
read so those of us on the committee
 
00:31:53.190 --> 00:31:53.200 align:start position:0%
that are going to have to vote for it
 
00:31:55.990 --> 00:31:56.000 align:start position:0%
know what we're voting for
 
00:31:57.909 --> 00:31:57.919 align:start position:0%

00:32:01.590 --> 00:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
did you get your email situation fixed
 
00:32:05.190 --> 00:32:05.200 align:start position:0%

sent it and it went into oblivion so
 
00:32:17.269 --> 00:32:17.279 align:start position:0%
i'm pretty sure what's going to have to
 
00:32:18.630 --> 00:32:18.640 align:start position:0%
happen is they're going to have to hold
 
00:32:19.830 --> 00:32:19.840 align:start position:0%

the common understanding of new london
 
00:34:56.310 --> 00:34:56.320 align:start position:0%
new londoners since even before the
 
00:34:58.950 --> 00:34:58.960 align:start position:0%
roundabout was open townspeople have
 
00:35:01.190 --> 00:35:01.200 align:start position:0%
referred to it as the jesse levine
 
00:35:03.829 --> 00:35:03.839 align:start position:0%
roundabout because of her dogged support
 
00:35:06.630 --> 00:35:06.640 align:start position:0%
of the project in her belief not held by
 
00:35:08.790 --> 00:35:08.800 align:start position:0%
all that the roundabout would increase
 
00:35:10.870 --> 00:35:10.880 align:start position:0%
the safety of citizens traveling on
 
00:35:13.109 --> 00:35:13.119 align:start position:0%
newport and county roads
 
00:35:15.109 --> 00:35:15.119 align:start position:0%
townspeople saw jesse as a leader of
 
00:35:17.349 --> 00:35:17.359 align:start position:0%
what was at first a very controversial
 
00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
project many had never heard about
 
00:35:21.750 --> 00:35:21.760 align:start position:0%
roundabouts and many feared chaos and
 
00:35:25.030 --> 00:35:25.040 align:start position:0%
mayhem would result if it was ever built
 
00:35:26.950 --> 00:35:26.960 align:start position:0%
jesse addressed all of these concerns
 
00:35:29.109 --> 00:35:29.119 align:start position:0%
with patience and good humor until there
 
00:35:30.790 --> 00:35:30.800 align:start position:0%
was enough support to get funding for
 
00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:32.240 align:start position:0%
the project
 
00:35:33.750 --> 00:35:33.760 align:start position:0%
now more than 10 years after the
 
00:35:35.910 --> 00:35:35.920 align:start position:0%
roundabout open even the detractors
 
00:35:37.510 --> 00:35:37.520 align:start position:0%
admit that the roundabout is a big
 
00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:38.550 align:start position:0%
admit that the roundabout is a big
success

00:35:38.550 --> 00:35:38.560 align:start position:0%
success
 
00:35:40.390 --> 00:35:40.400 align:start position:0%
this is thanks to the efforts of many
 
00:35:42.790 --> 00:35:42.800 align:start position:0%
but in particular jesse levine who just
 
00:35:44.550 --> 00:35:44.560 align:start position:0%
wouldn't give up on getting something
 
00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:46.240 align:start position:0%
that was virtually unheard of at the
 
00:35:48.470 --> 00:35:48.480 align:start position:0%
time built in new london
 
00:35:49.750 --> 00:35:49.760 align:start position:0%
we can't think of a better way to
 
00:35:51.829 --> 00:35:51.839 align:start position:0%
recognize jesse's efforts than naming
 
00:35:53.750 --> 00:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
the roundabout in her honor
 
00:35:56.550 --> 00:35:56.560 align:start position:0%

00:45:54.630 --> 00:45:54.640 align:start position:0%
this the memorial will honor all the
 
00:45:57.270 --> 00:45:57.280 align:start position:0%
troopers who have fallen in line of duty
 
00:45:59.589 --> 00:45:59.599 align:start position:0%
since the state police was create sorry

men and women in this police force they
 
00:46:12.550 --> 00:46:12.560 align:start position:0%

country
 
00:46:16.069 --> 00:46:16.079 align:start position:0%
and what this bill will do is like i
 
00:46:18.390 --> 00:46:18.400 align:start position:0%
said it will honor the troops but also
 
00:46:19.990 --> 00:46:20.000 align:start position:0%
what it does is street it's going to
 
00:46:22.309 --> 00:46:22.319 align:start position:0%
streamline the process that allows the
 
00:46:23.829 --> 00:46:23.839 align:start position:0%
memorial committee
 
00:46:25.829 --> 00:46:25.839 align:start position:0%
to disperse the private funds without
 
00:46:27.750 --> 00:46:27.760 align:start position:0%
having to continuously go to the
 
00:46:30.550 --> 00:46:30.560 align:start position:0%
governor and the executive council
 
00:46:30.560 --> 00:46:31.990 align:start position:0%
governor and the executive council
um

00:46:31.990 --> 00:46:32.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:35.270 --> 00:46:35.280 align:start position:0%
what what happens right now is because
 
00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:36.550 align:start position:0%
what what happens right now is because
um

00:46:36.550 --> 00:46:36.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:39.670 --> 00:46:39.680 align:start position:0%
because many of the the memorial
 
00:46:41.670 --> 00:46:41.680 align:start position:0%
uh the memorial is going to have a
 
00:46:44.390 --> 00:46:44.400 align:start position:0%
number of contractors so rather than
 
00:46:46.790 --> 00:46:46.800 align:start position:0%
having to have each piece that each
 
00:46:48.470 --> 00:46:48.480 align:start position:0%
contractor is working on to go to the
 
00:46:50.309 --> 00:46:50.319 align:start position:0%
executive council
 
00:46:53.109 --> 00:46:53.119 align:start position:0%
it will allow the um
 
00:46:54.829 --> 00:46:54.839 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:46:58.309 --> 00:46:58.319 align:start position:0%
contract it's a very slow process
 
00:47:01.190 --> 00:47:01.200 align:start position:0%
and where the executive council and um
 
00:47:03.670 --> 00:47:03.680 align:start position:0%
meet only once a month it will
 
00:47:05.430 --> 00:47:05.440 align:start position:0%
streamline the process of trying to get
 
00:47:07.030 --> 00:47:07.040 align:start position:0%
the memorial going
 
00:47:09.910 --> 00:47:09.920 align:start position:0%
so with that i'll end my testimony and
 
00:47:13.349 --> 00:47:13.359 align:start position:0%
and try and answer any questions
 
00:47:15.270 --> 00:47:15.280 align:start position:0%
thank you senator are there any

senator uh how does the governor and the
 
00:47:27.109 --> 00:47:27.119 align:start position:0%
council fall on this
 
00:47:29.349 --> 00:47:29.359 align:start position:0%
if you know
 
00:47:31.510 --> 00:47:31.520 align:start position:0%

00:47:46.150 --> 00:47:46.160 align:start position:0%

senate bill 300
 
00:49:45.430 --> 00:49:45.440 align:start position:0%
what this will allow us it'll allow us
 
00:49:47.670 --> 00:49:47.680 align:start position:0%
to streamline the process
 
00:49:50.710 --> 00:49:50.720 align:start position:0%
to disperse uh some of the funds needed
 
00:49:51.990 --> 00:49:52.000 align:start position:0%
along the way
 
00:49:53.750 --> 00:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
currently we have a number of
 
00:49:53.760 --> 00:49:55.349 align:start position:0%
currently we have a number of
contractors

00:49:55.349 --> 00:49:55.359 align:start position:0%
contractors
 
00:49:56.950 --> 00:49:56.960 align:start position:0%
we don't just have one general contract
 
00:49:59.349 --> 00:49:59.359 align:start position:0%
we have a number of them
 
00:50:02.549 --> 00:50:02.559 align:start position:0%
and they are all doing basically the
 
00:50:02.559 --> 00:50:03.589 align:start position:0%
and they are all doing basically the
work

00:50:03.589 --> 00:50:03.599 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:50:06.230 --> 00:50:06.240 align:start position:0%
for uh for a donation
 
00:50:07.829 --> 00:50:07.839 align:start position:0%
and if they happen to come upon
 
00:50:10.549 --> 00:50:10.559 align:start position:0%
something that they need a part or or a
 
00:50:12.950 --> 00:50:12.960 align:start position:0%
piece of material
 
00:50:15.829 --> 00:50:15.839 align:start position:0%
it will delay the process for us to stop
 
00:50:17.829 --> 00:50:17.839 align:start position:0%
and go to governors and councils to get
 
00:50:20.069 --> 00:50:20.079 align:start position:0%
that small
 
00:50:22.309 --> 00:50:22.319 align:start position:0%
piece of equipment or
 
00:50:24.390 --> 00:50:24.400 align:start position:0%
material that they need to finish the
 
00:50:27.109 --> 00:50:27.119 align:start position:0%
job all the funds are privately raised
 
00:50:29.589 --> 00:50:29.599 align:start position:0%
through donations and there is no uh

was planned
 
01:16:05.669 --> 01:16:05.679 align:start position:0%
um planned to be done in i think
 
01:16:08.790 --> 01:16:08.800 align:start position:0%
two years now it's um extended out two
 
01:16:12.950 --> 01:16:12.960 align:start position:0%
or three or uh three years and the ta
 
01:16:16.870 --> 01:16:16.880 align:start position:0%
the dot has brought it back um
 
01:16:19.669 --> 01:16:19.679 align:start position:0%
within i think six months but this is
 
01:16:22.950 --> 01:16:22.960 align:start position:0%
basically a project that londonderry and
 
01:16:25.350 --> 01:16:25.360 align:start position:0%
dairy have been looking forward to uh
 
01:16:28.470 --> 01:16:28.480 align:start position:0%
getting completed quickly and on time
 
01:16:30.870 --> 01:16:30.880 align:start position:0%
because they have they have a lot of
 
01:16:33.110 --> 01:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
economic development that is planning
 
01:16:35.350 --> 01:16:35.360 align:start position:0%
that they had been planning on
 
01:16:38.870 --> 01:16:38.880 align:start position:0%
um they can't afford the time that um
 
01:16:42.550 --> 01:16:42.560 align:start position:0%
the dot has um extended it out
 
01:16:45.110 --> 01:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
and i know that this is unusual the
 
01:16:47.590 --> 01:16:47.600 align:start position:0%
10-year plan will
 
01:16:50.470 --> 01:16:50.480 align:start position:0%
will be dealing with it but i also feel
 
01:16:54.310 --> 01:16:54.320 align:start position:0%
that we need to let d.o.t know how much
 
01:16:56.310 --> 01:16:56.320 align:start position:0%
it means to londonderry and derry to get
 
01:17:00.870 --> 01:17:00.880 align:start position:0%
this job done on time as promised and
 
01:17:02.870 --> 01:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
maybe not necessarily on budget we're
 
01:17:04.790 --> 01:17:04.800 align:start position:0%
hoping that there is money from the feds
 
01:17:07.270 --> 01:17:07.280 align:start position:0%
that will come in to help um speed this
 
01:17:07.280 --> 01:17:08.470 align:start position:0%

01:17:22.630 --> 01:17:22.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:26.149 --> 01:17:26.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:31.189 --> 01:17:31.199 align:start position:0%
i have one senator and it may be
 
01:17:34.390 --> 01:17:34.400 align:start position:0%
deferred to uh mr cass when when he
 
01:17:37.910 --> 01:17:37.920 align:start position:0%
testifies but i was just looking at the
 
01:17:39.910 --> 01:17:39.920 align:start position:0%
current 10-year plan
 
01:17:42.550 --> 01:17:42.560 align:start position:0%
where it talks about construction
 
01:17:44.709 --> 01:17:44.719 align:start position:0%
um being done
 
01:17:44.719 --> 01:17:46.310 align:start position:0%
um being done
um

01:17:46.310 --> 01:17:46.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:50.950 --> 01:17:50.960 align:start position:0%
21 22 23 and finished nothing 24.
 
01:17:52.950 --> 01:17:52.960 align:start position:0%
is this the delay that you're talking
 
01:17:52.960 --> 01:17:54.310 align:start position:0%
is this the delay that you're talking
about

01:17:54.310 --> 01:17:54.320 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:17:56.790 --> 01:17:56.800 align:start position:0%
no i believe that last summer they came
 
01:17:59.910 --> 01:17:59.920 align:start position:0%
out with a delay out to 24.
 
01:18:01.510 --> 01:18:01.520 align:start position:0%
but again
 
01:18:03.910 --> 01:18:03.920 align:start position:0%
deputy commissioner cass can better
 
01:18:07.510 --> 01:18:07.520 align:start position:0%
define that but um we wanted it done to
 
01:18:10.149 --> 01:18:10.159 align:start position:0%
the 10-year plan
 
01:18:10.159 --> 01:18:11.510 align:start position:0%
the 10-year plan
plan

01:18:11.510 --> 01:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
plan
 
01:18:13.910 --> 01:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
and uh they extended it out because of
 
01:18:15.270 --> 01:18:15.280 align:start position:0%
the cost
 
01:18:17.590 --> 01:18:17.600 align:start position:0%
because of the delays i think the cost
 
01:18:20.229 --> 01:18:20.239 align:start position:0%
had gone up 30 million dollars
 
01:18:24.390 --> 01:18:24.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:29.350 --> 01:18:29.360 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions to
 
01:18:32.470 --> 01:18:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:32.480 --> 01:18:33.830 align:start position:0%
 
see

01:18:33.830 --> 01:18:33.840 align:start position:0%

can everybody hear me all right i just
 
01:19:00.480 --> 01:19:01.750 align:start position:0%
can everybody hear me all right i just
wanna

01:19:01.750 --> 01:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
wanna
 
01:19:04.709 --> 01:19:04.719 align:start position:0%
connection is there good
 
01:19:07.669 --> 01:19:07.679 align:start position:0%
um yeah thank you for um
 
01:19:10.709 --> 01:19:10.719 align:start position:0%
letting me uh testify to the bill i just
 
01:19:12.390 --> 01:19:12.400 align:start position:0%
want to
 
01:19:14.709 --> 01:19:14.719 align:start position:0%
make sure i clarify things so that
 
01:19:16.709 --> 01:19:16.719 align:start position:0%
everything is clear i can offer a little
 
01:19:18.950 --> 01:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
bit more detail from what senator
 
01:19:21.189 --> 01:19:21.199 align:start position:0%
birdsell had
 
01:19:23.750 --> 01:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
had presented in terms of uh and i'll do
 
01:19:25.430 --> 01:19:25.440 align:start position:0%
it very quickly some of the history of
 
01:19:26.870 --> 01:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
the project
 
01:19:28.390 --> 01:19:28.400 align:start position:0%
um so i think
 
01:19:28.400 --> 01:19:29.510 align:start position:0%
um so i think
um

01:19:29.510 --> 01:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:31.189 --> 01:19:31.199 align:start position:0%
from what i understand and from the
 
01:19:33.750 --> 01:19:33.760 align:start position:0%
testimony and discussion with with the
 
01:19:36.070 --> 01:19:36.080 align:start position:0%
senate that the legislative intent is
 
01:19:36.080 --> 01:19:37.430 align:start position:0%
senate that the legislative intent is
clear

01:19:37.430 --> 01:19:37.440 align:start position:0%
clear
 
01:19:39.590 --> 01:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
some of the language in in the bill if
 
01:19:43.990 --> 01:19:44.000 align:start position:0%
it is strictly interpreted may be
 
01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:44.410 align:start position:0%
it is strictly interpreted may be
um

01:19:44.410 --> 01:19:44.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:44.420 --> 01:19:45.750 align:start position:0%
um
[Music]

01:19:45.750 --> 01:19:45.760 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:19:47.990 --> 01:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
a little concerning but
 
01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:49.430 align:start position:0%
a little concerning but
um

01:19:49.430 --> 01:19:49.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:49.440 --> 01:19:50.709 align:start position:0%
um
so

01:19:50.709 --> 01:19:50.719 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:19:53.030 --> 01:19:53.040 align:start position:0%
the the bill is described as the design
 
01:19:55.270 --> 01:19:55.280 align:start position:0%
build exit for a
 
01:19:58.709 --> 01:19:58.719 align:start position:0%
project um to complete the design build
 
01:20:01.830 --> 01:20:01.840 align:start position:0%
project named dairy londonderry
 
01:20:04.630 --> 01:20:04.640 align:start position:0%
so we had proceeded with this project
 
01:20:07.350 --> 01:20:07.360 align:start position:0%
under a design build procurement which
 
01:20:07.360 --> 01:20:08.629 align:start position:0%
under a design build procurement which
um

01:20:08.629 --> 01:20:08.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:11.430 --> 01:20:11.440 align:start position:0%
which was all intended to accelerate the
 
01:20:11.440 --> 01:20:12.709 align:start position:0%
which was all intended to accelerate the
delivery

01:20:12.709 --> 01:20:12.719 align:start position:0%
delivery
 
01:20:14.470 --> 01:20:14.480 align:start position:0%
of the project
 
01:20:17.590 --> 01:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
last fall when we opened bids for the
 
01:20:20.390 --> 01:20:20.400 align:start position:0%
from the design bid consultants
 
01:20:23.030 --> 01:20:23.040 align:start position:0%
the bids were uh and and
 
01:20:25.430 --> 01:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
as senator had pointed out more than 30
 
01:20:29.910 --> 01:20:29.920 align:start position:0%
million dollars over our estimate and
 
01:20:33.030 --> 01:20:33.040 align:start position:0%
because of that and and after debriefs
 
01:20:35.910 --> 01:20:35.920 align:start position:0%
with the design build teams and looking
 
01:20:35.920 --> 01:20:37.110 align:start position:0%
with the design build teams and looking
at

01:20:37.110 --> 01:20:37.120 align:start position:0%
at
 
01:20:41.189 --> 01:20:41.199 align:start position:0%
the risk and the things involved um
 
01:20:43.830 --> 01:20:43.840 align:start position:0%
we decided not to award the contract and
 
01:20:45.510 --> 01:20:45.520 align:start position:0%
to take a step back
 
01:20:47.830 --> 01:20:47.840 align:start position:0%
and to proceed with the project under a
 
01:20:49.430 --> 01:20:49.440 align:start position:0%
more conventional
 
01:20:53.500 --> 01:20:53.510 align:start position:0%
design bid build procurement
 
01:20:53.510 --> 01:20:55.030 align:start position:0%
design bid build procurement
[Music]

01:20:55.030 --> 01:20:55.040 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:20:55.040 --> 01:20:56.229 align:start position:0%
[Music]
approach

01:20:56.229 --> 01:20:56.239 align:start position:0%
approach
 
01:20:57.910 --> 01:20:57.920 align:start position:0%
because of the risk involved and in
 
01:21:00.149 --> 01:21:00.159 align:start position:0%
particularly what we heard was because
 
01:21:01.990 --> 01:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:21:03.990 --> 01:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
right-of-way acquisitions that the
 
01:21:06.550 --> 01:21:06.560 align:start position:0%
design build team was
 
01:21:06.560 --> 01:21:07.830 align:start position:0%
design build team was
was

01:21:07.830 --> 01:21:07.840 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:21:09.990 --> 01:21:10.000 align:start position:0%
asked to deal with and they placed a lot
 
01:21:12.870 --> 01:21:12.880 align:start position:0%
of risk in that
 
01:21:15.030 --> 01:21:15.040 align:start position:0%
in that area so
 
01:21:17.189 --> 01:21:17.199 align:start position:0%
taking a step back and doing a
 
01:21:19.030 --> 01:21:19.040 align:start position:0%
conventional design bid builds
 
01:21:21.350 --> 01:21:21.360 align:start position:0%
procurement process we had committed uh
 
01:21:23.350 --> 01:21:23.360 align:start position:0%
and we had meetings uh
 
01:21:26.470 --> 01:21:26.480 align:start position:0%
last november uh to brief uh a lot of
 
01:21:29.030 --> 01:21:29.040 align:start position:0%
the local um
 
01:21:29.040 --> 01:21:30.310 align:start position:0%
the local um
um

01:21:30.310 --> 01:21:30.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:33.750 --> 01:21:33.760 align:start position:0%
politicians and the towns on on our um
 
01:21:36.070 --> 01:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
accelerated schedule to do a design bid
 
01:21:38.149 --> 01:21:38.159 align:start position:0%
build procurement so
 
01:21:38.159 --> 01:21:39.510 align:start position:0%
build procurement so
um

01:21:39.510 --> 01:21:39.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:41.669 --> 01:21:41.679 align:start position:0%
it does compared to the schedule that's
 
01:21:43.669 --> 01:21:43.679 align:start position:0%
in the 10-year plan the 10-year plan had
 
01:21:46.709 --> 01:21:46.719 align:start position:0%
construction funds
 
01:21:48.709 --> 01:21:48.719 align:start position:0%
to build this project between
 
01:21:53.030 --> 01:21:53.040 align:start position:0%
fiscal year or calendar 2021 and 2024.
 
01:21:55.590 --> 01:21:55.600 align:start position:0%
with the design bid build procurement we
 
01:21:58.229 --> 01:21:58.239 align:start position:0%
have we recognize certainly the priority
 
01:22:00.709 --> 01:22:00.719 align:start position:0%
of the project and the needs and we have
 
01:22:03.669 --> 01:22:03.679 align:start position:0%
worked to accelerate that as as quickly
 
01:22:05.430 --> 01:22:05.440 align:start position:0%
as practicable
 
01:22:07.430 --> 01:22:07.440 align:start position:0%
and the schedule we laid out committed
 
01:22:09.270 --> 01:22:09.280 align:start position:0%
to getting out to construction in the
 
01:22:12.149 --> 01:22:12.159 align:start position:0%
spring of 2022 so we have a design
 
01:22:14.149 --> 01:22:14.159 align:start position:0%
consultant um already on board we're
 
01:22:16.390 --> 01:22:16.400 align:start position:0%
working through the design and and
 
01:22:18.550 --> 01:22:18.560 align:start position:0%
and things to have a contract ready to
 
01:22:21.910 --> 01:22:21.920 align:start position:0%
bid in uh 2022
 
01:22:21.920 --> 01:22:22.870 align:start position:0%
bid in uh 2022
um

01:22:22.870 --> 01:22:22.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:26.950 --> 01:22:26.960 align:start position:0%
but with the right-of-way uh procurement
 
01:22:29.590 --> 01:22:29.600 align:start position:0%
um uh uh right-of-way acquisitions that
 
01:22:30.629 --> 01:22:30.639 align:start position:0%
are needed
 
01:22:32.070 --> 01:22:32.080 align:start position:0%
we uh
 
01:22:33.750 --> 01:22:33.760 align:start position:0%
do think that that
 
01:22:35.910 --> 01:22:35.920 align:start position:0%
delivery schedule is gonna extend
 
01:22:39.669 --> 01:22:39.679 align:start position:0%
between 2022 to 2026.
 
01:22:42.470 --> 01:22:42.480 align:start position:0%
so potentially two more two years longer
 
01:22:43.910 --> 01:22:43.920 align:start position:0%
than the schedule that's in the 10-year
 
01:22:46.629 --> 01:22:46.639 align:start position:0%
plan however we have noted that there
 
01:22:47.990 --> 01:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
will be
 
01:22:51.270 --> 01:22:51.280 align:start position:0%
a opportunity there will be a partial
 
01:22:53.830 --> 01:22:53.840 align:start position:0%
opening of the exit to public use when
 
01:22:55.350 --> 01:22:55.360 align:start position:0%
you get to
 
01:22:57.430 --> 01:22:57.440 align:start position:0%
essentially route 28 if you're familiar
 
01:22:58.390 --> 01:22:58.400 align:start position:0%
with the
 
01:22:58.400 --> 01:22:59.510 align:start position:0%
with the
um

01:22:59.510 --> 01:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:59.520 --> 01:23:00.709 align:start position:0%
um
layout

01:23:00.709 --> 01:23:00.719 align:start position:0%
layout
 
01:23:03.910 --> 01:23:03.920 align:start position:0%
and you know we anticipate that probably
 
01:23:06.229 --> 01:23:06.239 align:start position:0%
sometime in 2025
 
01:23:11.110 --> 01:23:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:13.189 --> 01:23:13.199 align:start position:0%
original 10-year plan schedule was
 
01:23:17.990 --> 01:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:21.830 --> 01:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
but um certainly not as uh but but i
 
01:23:23.669 --> 01:23:23.679 align:start position:0%
think we will be having it open to
 
01:23:26.790 --> 01:23:26.800 align:start position:0%
public use prior to the full build full
 
01:23:29.510 --> 01:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
fully full construction completion
 
01:23:31.110 --> 01:23:31.120 align:start position:0%
so that's some of the schedule and the
 
01:23:33.669 --> 01:23:33.679 align:start position:0%
details and i believe like when we when
 
01:23:35.830 --> 01:23:35.840 align:start position:0%
when when we talked about
 
01:23:39.189 --> 01:23:39.199 align:start position:0%
um talked about it with with the senate
 
01:23:41.189 --> 01:23:41.199 align:start position:0%
that the legislative intent was you know
 
01:23:43.270 --> 01:23:43.280 align:start position:0%
holding our feet to the fire making sure
 
01:23:45.270 --> 01:23:45.280 align:start position:0%
that we understood that it was a
 
01:23:47.030 --> 01:23:47.040 align:start position:0%
priority to the towns of derry and
 
01:23:49.350 --> 01:23:49.360 align:start position:0%
londonderry and delivering the project
 
01:23:52.229 --> 01:23:52.239 align:start position:0%
as as soon as possible and as close to
 
01:23:54.790 --> 01:23:54.800 align:start position:0%
the original 10-year plan schedule as
 
01:23:54.800 --> 01:23:55.990 align:start position:0%
the original 10-year plan schedule as
possible

01:23:55.990 --> 01:23:56.000 align:start position:0%
possible
 
01:23:57.590 --> 01:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
so i think
 
01:24:00.390 --> 01:24:00.400 align:start position:0%
the legislative intent is there
 
01:24:00.400 --> 01:24:01.270 align:start position:0%
the legislative intent is there
the

01:24:01.270 --> 01:24:01.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:24:03.669 --> 01:24:03.679 align:start position:0%
the the specific language in the tenure
 
01:24:05.189 --> 01:24:05.199 align:start position:0%
plan from from the schedules and stuff
 
01:24:07.030 --> 01:24:07.040 align:start position:0%
that we've laid out
 
01:24:09.350 --> 01:24:09.360 align:start position:0%
is a little challenging in in that
 
01:24:10.950 --> 01:24:10.960 align:start position:0%
regard so
 
01:24:10.960 --> 01:24:12.310 align:start position:0%
regard so
um

01:24:12.310 --> 01:24:12.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:13.990 --> 01:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
i guess i would just leave it at that
 
01:24:17.110 --> 01:24:17.120 align:start position:0%
and uh uh can answer any any questions
 
01:24:19.270 --> 01:24:19.280 align:start position:0%
but we i just would close by saying and
 
01:24:22.950 --> 01:24:22.960 align:start position:0%
we have assured that the the towns
 
01:24:25.430 --> 01:24:25.440 align:start position:0%
and senator birdsell that we recognize
 
01:24:27.270 --> 01:24:27.280 align:start position:0%
it as a priority and we are fully
 
01:24:29.750 --> 01:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
committed to prosecuting
 
01:24:31.910 --> 01:24:31.920 align:start position:0%
the design and construction as
 
01:24:35.510 --> 01:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
expediently as possible
 
01:24:37.030 --> 01:24:37.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:24:41.350 --> 01:24:41.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:43.350 --> 01:24:43.360 align:start position:0%
thank you go ahead
 
01:24:46.229 --> 01:24:46.239 align:start position:0%
thank you mr jerich um
 
01:24:49.350 --> 01:24:49.360 align:start position:0%
my question is the uh
 
01:24:52.070 --> 01:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
overrun of 30 million dollars
 
01:24:54.470 --> 01:24:54.480 align:start position:0%
and then taking it back to someone
 
01:24:57.189 --> 01:24:57.199 align:start position:0%
internally and reworking that do you do
 
01:24:58.550 --> 01:24:58.560 align:start position:0%
you anticipate
 
01:25:00.709 --> 01:25:00.719 align:start position:0%
and being out one more year for the
 
01:25:02.310 --> 01:25:02.320 align:start position:0%
release of that bid
 
01:25:06.950 --> 01:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
that you'll still be in that range or
 
01:25:07.990 --> 01:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
do you
 
01:25:09.910 --> 01:25:09.920 align:start position:0%
is the department hoping that that
 
01:25:12.550 --> 01:25:12.560 align:start position:0%
number that 30 million will be a lesser
 
01:25:12.560 --> 01:25:14.709 align:start position:0%
number that 30 million will be a lesser
number

01:25:14.709 --> 01:25:14.719 align:start position:0%
number
 
01:25:17.430 --> 01:25:17.440 align:start position:0%
we are um
 
01:25:19.510 --> 01:25:19.520 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't even say hoping i would you
 
01:25:22.070 --> 01:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
know i just challenged to stay confident
 
01:25:24.629 --> 01:25:24.639 align:start position:0%
but we are we are pretty certain that
 
01:25:28.070 --> 01:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
through a conventional design bid build
 
01:25:30.229 --> 01:25:30.239 align:start position:0%
we can design out
 
01:25:33.669 --> 01:25:33.679 align:start position:0%
some of the risk that was reflected in
 
01:25:36.070 --> 01:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
that design bid build price so they were
 
01:25:39.030 --> 01:25:39.040 align:start position:0%
giving us a a construction price bidding
 
01:25:40.390 --> 01:25:40.400 align:start position:0%
it on
 
01:25:40.400 --> 01:25:41.430 align:start position:0%
it on
30

01:25:41.430 --> 01:25:41.440 align:start position:0%
30
 
01:25:43.669 --> 01:25:43.679 align:start position:0%
level plans and there was you know
 
01:25:45.990 --> 01:25:46.000 align:start position:0%
uncertainty in that that i think was
 
01:25:48.390 --> 01:25:48.400 align:start position:0%
reflected in the price so
 
01:25:50.790 --> 01:25:50.800 align:start position:0%
i am relatively confident maybe that's
 
01:25:52.229 --> 01:25:52.239 align:start position:0%
the best way to put it that we can
 
01:25:52.239 --> 01:25:53.270 align:start position:0%
the best way to put it that we can
design

01:25:53.270 --> 01:25:53.280 align:start position:0%
design
 
01:25:53.280 --> 01:25:54.629 align:start position:0%
design
out

01:25:54.629 --> 01:25:54.639 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:25:56.790 --> 01:25:56.800 align:start position:0%
some of that cost increase
 
01:25:59.430 --> 01:25:59.440 align:start position:0%
whether it will be
 
01:26:00.629 --> 01:26:00.639 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:26:03.590 --> 01:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
fully what our estimate is or somewhere
 
01:26:05.830 --> 01:26:05.840 align:start position:0%
in between there i do not believe it
 
01:26:07.030 --> 01:26:07.040 align:start position:0%
will be
 
01:26:09.270 --> 01:26:09.280 align:start position:0%
30 million dollars more than our present
 
01:26:11.030 --> 01:26:11.040 align:start position:0%
estimate it may be a little bit more
 
01:26:12.629 --> 01:26:12.639 align:start position:0%
there is going to be inflation there are
 
01:26:15.030 --> 01:26:15.040 align:start position:0%
going to be details that we work out
 
01:26:18.070 --> 01:26:18.080 align:start position:0%
but i think um
 
01:26:18.080 --> 01:26:18.870 align:start position:0%
but i think um
we

01:26:18.870 --> 01:26:18.880 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:26:20.070 --> 01:26:20.080 align:start position:0%
you know and that was part of our
 
01:26:22.550 --> 01:26:22.560 align:start position:0%
decision to design to go with the design
 
01:26:24.950 --> 01:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
bid build that we could not justify at
 
01:26:26.310 --> 01:26:26.320 align:start position:0%
that time
 
01:26:28.950 --> 01:26:28.960 align:start position:0%
that cost increase and i believe that we
 
01:26:32.709 --> 01:26:32.719 align:start position:0%
will deliver it for um
 
01:26:33.990 --> 01:26:34.000 align:start position:0%
for less
 
01:26:35.590 --> 01:26:35.600 align:start position:0%
thank you assistant commissioner thank
 
01:26:35.600 --> 01:26:37.110 align:start position:0%
thank you assistant commissioner thank
you

01:26:37.110 --> 01:26:37.120 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:26:39.110 --> 01:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
included okay thank you mr chairman uh
 
01:26:42.229 --> 01:26:42.239 align:start position:0%
mr cass i just want to be clear does the
 
01:26:44.550 --> 01:26:44.560 align:start position:0%
department may i ask have a position on
 
01:26:47.990 --> 01:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:49.110 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:26:49.110 --> 01:26:49.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:26:52.229 --> 01:26:52.239 align:start position:0%
not not not particularly no uh other
 
01:26:53.990 --> 01:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
than i just other than i just wanted to
 
01:26:56.870 --> 01:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
point out what what we see is is
 
01:26:58.950 --> 01:26:58.960 align:start position:0%
kind of some some conflict conflicts
 
01:27:01.030 --> 01:27:01.040 align:start position:0%
with the with the
 
01:27:03.189 --> 01:27:03.199 align:start position:0%
specific language
 
01:27:04.870 --> 01:27:04.880 align:start position:0%
um from from what i understand the
 
01:27:04.880 --> 01:27:05.830 align:start position:0%
um from from what i understand the
intent

01:27:05.830 --> 01:27:05.840 align:start position:0%
intent
 
01:27:07.510 --> 01:27:07.520 align:start position:0%
to be
 
01:27:07.520 --> 01:27:08.470 align:start position:0%
to be
follow

01:27:08.470 --> 01:27:08.480 align:start position:0%
follow
 
01:27:12.310 --> 01:27:12.320 align:start position:0%
okay if this bill passes as written
 
01:27:14.709 --> 01:27:14.719 align:start position:0%
what's gonna happen what is wrong i mean
 
01:27:27.350 --> 01:27:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:29.910 --> 01:27:29.920 align:start position:0%
if the bill passes exactly as written i
 
01:27:31.750 --> 01:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
just want to point out that
 
01:27:34.790 --> 01:27:34.800 align:start position:0%
the time frame of the 10-year plan at
 
01:27:36.870 --> 01:27:36.880 align:start position:0%
this at this point
 
01:27:38.390 --> 01:27:38.400 align:start position:0%
cannot be met
 
01:27:41.110 --> 01:27:41.120 align:start position:0%
um i think like i said we will get it
 
01:27:43.350 --> 01:27:43.360 align:start position:0%
started as soon as possible
 
01:27:45.510 --> 01:27:45.520 align:start position:0%
we will get it started and it will be
 
01:27:47.510 --> 01:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
under construction
 
01:27:51.030 --> 01:27:51.040 align:start position:0%
we will have a contract out next spring
 
01:27:52.790 --> 01:27:52.800 align:start position:0%
but we are not going to be able to
 
01:27:56.950 --> 01:27:56.960 align:start position:0%
complete it in the um by the 2024 time
 
01:27:59.830 --> 01:27:59.840 align:start position:0%
frame that's in the present 10-year plan
 
01:27:59.840 --> 01:28:01.750 align:start position:0%
frame that's in the present 10-year plan
so

01:28:01.750 --> 01:28:01.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:28:03.350 --> 01:28:03.360 align:start position:0%
okay thank you mr kev thank you mr
 
01:28:05.910 --> 01:28:05.920 align:start position:0%
chairman representative thompson
 
01:28:05.920 --> 01:28:06.709 align:start position:0%
chairman representative thompson
um

01:28:06.709 --> 01:28:06.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:10.229 --> 01:28:10.239 align:start position:0%
deputy commissioner what was the uh
 
01:28:12.390 --> 01:28:12.400 align:start position:0%
what was the original estimate from your
 
01:28:18.149 --> 01:28:18.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:21.350 --> 01:28:21.360 align:start position:0%
round uh round numbers it might have
 
01:28:24.070 --> 01:28:24.080 align:start position:0%
been 59 something but um
 
01:28:25.990 --> 01:28:26.000 align:start position:0%
from from uh and i'm talking
 
01:28:29.030 --> 01:28:29.040 align:start position:0%
construction cost as well now so not
 
01:28:30.709 --> 01:28:30.719 align:start position:0%
including the right-of-way in the
 
01:28:32.070 --> 01:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
engineering that needs to be done but
 
01:28:34.550 --> 01:28:34.560 align:start position:0%
from a construction cost
 
01:28:36.790 --> 01:28:36.800 align:start position:0%
our estimate was um
 
01:28:38.950 --> 01:28:38.960 align:start position:0%
right around 60 million dollars and
 
01:28:41.350 --> 01:28:41.360 align:start position:0%
that's what's reflected in the in the in
 
01:28:43.510 --> 01:28:43.520 align:start position:0%
the 10-year plan
 
01:28:45.990 --> 01:28:46.000 align:start position:0%
and who was the contractor that came
 
01:28:50.709 --> 01:28:50.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:52.550 --> 01:28:52.560 align:start position:0%
who was the contractor that came back
 
01:28:55.510 --> 01:28:55.520 align:start position:0%
with the 30 million over
 
01:28:58.229 --> 01:28:58.239 align:start position:0%
well there were three proposals um since
 
01:29:02.229 --> 01:29:02.239 align:start position:0%
we didn't award the contract um
 
01:29:04.790 --> 01:29:04.800 align:start position:0%
we can't really talk about the the the
 
01:29:07.030 --> 01:29:07.040 align:start position:0%
details of the rfp procurement because
 
01:29:09.189 --> 01:29:09.199 align:start position:0%
we didn't proceed with with the with the
 
01:29:11.189 --> 01:29:11.199 align:start position:0%
contract so
 
01:29:13.830 --> 01:29:13.840 align:start position:0%
but the um you know apparent low bid of
 
01:29:16.870 --> 01:29:16.880 align:start position:0%
of that was more than 30 million dollars
 
01:29:20.629 --> 01:29:20.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:22.830 --> 01:29:22.840 align:start position:0%
thank you sir
 
01:29:24.470 --> 01:29:24.480 align:start position:0%
representative evil
 
01:29:26.790 --> 01:29:26.800 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much deputy
 
01:29:30.629 --> 01:29:30.639 align:start position:0%
commissioner for coming today um
 
01:29:34.149 --> 01:29:34.159 align:start position:0%
so i understand uh that it's recognized
 
01:29:38.070 --> 01:29:38.080 align:start position:0%
that it's unusual to introduce a bill
 
01:29:41.030 --> 01:29:41.040 align:start position:0%
like this out of cycle with the 10-year
 
01:29:41.040 --> 01:29:43.110 align:start position:0%
like this out of cycle with the 10-year
plan

01:29:43.110 --> 01:29:43.120 align:start position:0%
plan
 
01:29:43.120 --> 01:29:43.990 align:start position:0%
plan
i

01:29:43.990 --> 01:29:44.000 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:29:46.149 --> 01:29:46.159 align:start position:0%
understand your testimony that you're
 
01:29:48.950 --> 01:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
saying that if this is passed as is you
 
01:29:52.629 --> 01:29:52.639 align:start position:0%
can't achieve it in the time frame
 
01:29:52.639 --> 01:29:54.310 align:start position:0%
can't achieve it in the time frame
so

01:29:54.310 --> 01:29:54.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:29:54.320 --> 01:29:55.189 align:start position:0%
so
what

01:29:55.189 --> 01:29:55.199 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:29:57.590 --> 01:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
if we amended it so it was a realistic
 
01:30:00.550 --> 01:30:00.560 align:start position:0%
time frame what would i mean is there
 
01:30:02.790 --> 01:30:02.800 align:start position:0%
any reason you can see why we wouldn't
 
01:30:04.870 --> 01:30:04.880 align:start position:0%
handle this during the regular 10-year
 
01:30:04.880 --> 01:30:05.830 align:start position:0%
handle this during the regular 10-year
plan

01:30:05.830 --> 01:30:05.840 align:start position:0%
plan
 
01:30:05.840 --> 01:30:07.189 align:start position:0%
plan
process

01:30:07.189 --> 01:30:07.199 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:30:11.430 --> 01:30:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:11.440 --> 01:30:12.149 align:start position:0%
 
no

01:30:12.149 --> 01:30:12.159 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:30:12.159 --> 01:30:14.870 align:start position:0%
no
no

01:30:14.870 --> 01:30:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:14.880 --> 01:30:17.750 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

01:30:17.750 --> 01:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:21.590 --> 01:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
um i was just wondering is there
 
01:30:25.750 --> 01:30:25.760 align:start position:0%
a downside or an upside i mean i
 
01:30:27.830 --> 01:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
to doing it one way or the other that
 
01:30:31.430 --> 01:30:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:35.270 --> 01:30:35.280 align:start position:0%
uh this that for me yeah um
 
01:30:38.070 --> 01:30:38.080 align:start position:0%
no i mean i i recognize i i certainly
 
01:30:38.080 --> 01:30:39.350 align:start position:0%
no i mean i i recognize i i certainly
recognize

01:30:39.350 --> 01:30:39.360 align:start position:0%
recognize
 
01:30:39.360 --> 01:30:40.229 align:start position:0%
recognize
um

01:30:40.229 --> 01:30:40.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:44.149 --> 01:30:44.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:47.430 --> 01:30:47.440 align:start position:0%
not even desire but the but but but the
 
01:30:50.229 --> 01:30:50.239 align:start position:0%
guy to send a strong message
 
01:30:53.189 --> 01:30:53.199 align:start position:0%
um i can i i can tell you and i can tell
 
01:30:54.709 --> 01:30:54.719 align:start position:0%
you know senator birdsall and i did
 
01:30:56.470 --> 01:30:56.480 align:start position:0%
during the senate transportation that
 
01:30:58.310 --> 01:30:58.320 align:start position:0%
that message has has been received and
 
01:31:00.310 --> 01:31:00.320 align:start position:0%
we are committed to
 
01:31:03.270 --> 01:31:03.280 align:start position:0%
to um you know delivering this project
 
01:31:06.470 --> 01:31:06.480 align:start position:0%
as as quickly as we can and i believe
 
01:31:09.030 --> 01:31:09.040 align:start position:0%
that the schedule that we have laid out
 
01:31:11.669 --> 01:31:11.679 align:start position:0%
um has been recognized and generally
 
01:31:15.830 --> 01:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
accepted and that you know the the folks
 
01:31:18.149 --> 01:31:18.159 align:start position:0%
want to see us make sure
 
01:31:20.709 --> 01:31:20.719 align:start position:0%
make sure that that that we you know
 
01:31:22.629 --> 01:31:22.639 align:start position:0%
hold to that schedule and do everything
 
01:31:25.510 --> 01:31:25.520 align:start position:0%
we can to to meet that schedule i
 
01:31:27.270 --> 01:31:27.280 align:start position:0%
believe that's what the legislative
 
01:31:27.280 --> 01:31:28.310 align:start position:0%
believe that's what the legislative
intent

01:31:28.310 --> 01:31:28.320 align:start position:0%
intent
 
01:31:32.229 --> 01:31:32.239 align:start position:0%
is here so if if if this bill
 
01:31:34.390 --> 01:31:34.400 align:start position:0%
you know is is
 
01:31:34.400 --> 01:31:36.709 align:start position:0%
you know is is
is

01:31:36.709 --> 01:31:36.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:39.270 --> 01:31:39.280 align:start position:0%
um changed along along those lines that
 
01:31:41.990 --> 01:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
i mean that that that's that's fine it's
 
01:31:44.470 --> 01:31:44.480 align:start position:0%
that's your prerogative to to send that
 
01:31:44.480 --> 01:31:45.750 align:start position:0%
that's your prerogative to to send that
policy

01:31:45.750 --> 01:31:45.760 align:start position:0%
policy
 
01:31:49.030 --> 01:31:49.040 align:start position:0%
um direction to the department um and
 
01:31:51.510 --> 01:31:51.520 align:start position:0%
and uh we will do our best to
 
01:31:54.870 --> 01:31:54.880 align:start position:0%
to meet it so um
 
01:31:56.830 --> 01:31:56.840 align:start position:0%
but i guess my point is
 
01:32:00.550 --> 01:32:00.560 align:start position:0%
uh with or without this this this piece
 
01:32:03.910 --> 01:32:03.920 align:start position:0%
of legislation the the the we we're
 
01:32:07.030 --> 01:32:07.040 align:start position:0%
fully aware of of that message and fully
 
01:32:08.470 --> 01:32:08.480 align:start position:0%
committed to
 
01:32:08.480 --> 01:32:09.669 align:start position:0%
committed to
um

01:32:09.669 --> 01:32:09.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:11.750 --> 01:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
delivering this project as expedite as
 
01:32:14.310 --> 01:32:14.320 align:start position:0%
expeditiously as possible
 
01:32:19.669 --> 01:32:19.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:22.470 --> 01:32:22.480 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
01:32:23.910 --> 01:32:23.920 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
01:32:25.430 --> 01:32:25.440 align:start position:0%
deputy commissioner
 
01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:27.010 align:start position:0%
what what i'm
 
01:32:27.010 --> 01:32:28.950 align:start position:0%
what what i'm

01:32:28.950 --> 01:32:28.960 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:32:30.390 --> 01:32:30.400 align:start position:0%
what i'm hearing
 
01:32:32.790 --> 01:32:32.800 align:start position:0%
is that this
 
01:32:32.800 --> 01:32:35.189 align:start position:0%
is that this
bill

01:32:35.189 --> 01:32:35.199 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:32:38.830 --> 01:32:38.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:38.840 --> 01:32:40.550 align:start position:0%
 
impossible

01:32:40.550 --> 01:32:40.560 align:start position:0%
impossible
 
01:32:42.390 --> 01:32:42.400 align:start position:0%
to achieve
 
01:32:44.470 --> 01:32:44.480 align:start position:0%
based on the cost
 
01:32:44.480 --> 01:32:45.510 align:start position:0%
based on the cost
and

01:32:45.510 --> 01:32:45.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:32:45.520 --> 01:32:46.390 align:start position:0%
and
the

01:32:46.390 --> 01:32:46.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:32:49.830 --> 01:32:49.840 align:start position:0%
bidding process going forward and
 
01:32:52.390 --> 01:32:52.400 align:start position:0%
maybe it would be a good idea
 
01:32:55.830 --> 01:32:55.840 align:start position:0%
is representative eibel has said
 
01:32:58.470 --> 01:32:58.480 align:start position:0%
to include this because
 
01:33:01.590 --> 01:33:01.600 align:start position:0%
what you're saying from a time frame
 
01:33:03.750 --> 01:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
is that uh
 
01:33:05.110 --> 01:33:05.120 align:start position:0%
it's not going to be even
 
01:33:05.120 --> 01:33:07.590 align:start position:0%
it's not going to be even
[Music]

01:33:07.590 --> 01:33:07.600 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:33:09.910 --> 01:33:09.920 align:start position:0%
till next spring
 
01:33:12.950 --> 01:33:12.960 align:start position:0%
so to and that's one of the major tasks
 
01:33:14.629 --> 01:33:14.639 align:start position:0%
that we have
 
01:33:14.639 --> 01:33:15.750 align:start position:0%
that we have
for

01:33:15.750 --> 01:33:15.760 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:33:15.760 --> 01:33:18.149 align:start position:0%
for
uh

01:33:18.149 --> 01:33:18.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:19.270 --> 01:33:19.280 align:start position:0%
the next
 
01:33:19.280 --> 01:33:20.709 align:start position:0%
the next
session

01:33:20.709 --> 01:33:20.719 align:start position:0%
session
 
01:33:23.750 --> 01:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
is to uh or the session beginning in
 
01:33:23.760 --> 01:33:25.189 align:start position:0%
is to uh or the session beginning in
january

01:33:25.189 --> 01:33:25.199 align:start position:0%
january
 
01:33:28.310 --> 01:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
is to come up with a 10-year plan
 
01:33:30.470 --> 01:33:30.480 align:start position:0%
so it wouldn't make more sense to just
 
01:33:33.510 --> 01:33:33.520 align:start position:0%
include it with that rather than to pass
 
01:33:35.590 --> 01:33:35.600 align:start position:0%
a piece of legislation that's
 
01:33:35.600 --> 01:33:42.790 align:start position:0%
a piece of legislation that's
unachievable

01:33:42.790 --> 01:33:42.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:42.800 --> 01:33:43.669 align:start position:0%
 
i

01:33:43.669 --> 01:33:43.679 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:33:45.750 --> 01:33:45.760 align:start position:0%
i i
 
01:33:48.070 --> 01:33:48.080 align:start position:0%
yes yes i would say so the the one thing
 
01:33:50.070 --> 01:33:50.080 align:start position:0%
i think about this legislation is is to
 
01:33:52.070 --> 01:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
send that strong message about the the
 
01:33:54.709 --> 01:33:54.719 align:start position:0%
prioritization of of of the project and
 
01:33:56.470 --> 01:33:56.480 align:start position:0%
and to that degree
 
01:33:58.070 --> 01:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
like i said i think the legislative
 
01:34:00.070 --> 01:34:00.080 align:start position:0%
intent behind it from the discussions
 
01:34:04.790 --> 01:34:04.800 align:start position:0%
and stuff um is is is is good and we're
 
01:34:07.189 --> 01:34:07.199 align:start position:0%
honoring honoring that i just had wanted
 
01:34:10.070 --> 01:34:10.080 align:start position:0%
to point out that that the
 
01:34:11.270 --> 01:34:11.280 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:34:14.390 --> 01:34:14.400 align:start position:0%
a technical direct interpretation of of
 
01:34:16.550 --> 01:34:16.560 align:start position:0%
the way the bill is written is
 
01:34:18.870 --> 01:34:18.880 align:start position:0%
problematic at this point uh in the
 
01:34:18.880 --> 01:34:24.709 align:start position:0%
problematic at this point uh in the
project

01:34:24.709 --> 01:34:24.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:26.950 --> 01:34:26.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh and thank you
 
01:34:29.110 --> 01:34:29.120 align:start position:0%
deputy cass for taking this question i
 
01:34:29.120 --> 01:34:30.070 align:start position:0%
deputy cass for taking this question i
have

01:34:30.070 --> 01:34:30.080 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:34:31.750 --> 01:34:31.760 align:start position:0%
the way the
 
01:34:34.310 --> 01:34:34.320 align:start position:0%
foes bill is written again it talks
 
01:34:36.149 --> 01:34:36.159 align:start position:0%
about design build
 
01:34:36.159 --> 01:34:37.669 align:start position:0%
about design build
um

01:34:37.669 --> 01:34:37.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:39.430 --> 01:34:39.440 align:start position:0%
i take it from what you were saying is
 
01:34:41.830 --> 01:34:41.840 align:start position:0%
that you're you're switching over to
 
01:34:44.070 --> 01:34:44.080 align:start position:0%
the design in it and then constructing
 
01:34:44.080 --> 01:34:45.030 align:start position:0%
the design in it and then constructing
it

01:34:45.030 --> 01:34:45.040 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:34:46.950 --> 01:34:46.960 align:start position:0%
it is the way the bill is written right
 
01:34:48.470 --> 01:34:48.480 align:start position:0%
now would change the way you're
 
01:34:50.229 --> 01:34:50.239 align:start position:0%
intending to do it and wouldn't that
 
01:34:55.030 --> 01:34:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:55.040 --> 01:34:56.550 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:34:56.550 --> 01:34:56.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:58.790 --> 01:34:58.800 align:start position:0%
i think it's i think it depends on how
 
01:35:02.470 --> 01:35:02.480 align:start position:0%
it's interpreted um
 
01:35:04.950 --> 01:35:04.960 align:start position:0%
the way it is referenced as the design
 
01:35:06.790 --> 01:35:06.800 align:start position:0%
build project named
 
01:35:08.709 --> 01:35:08.719 align:start position:0%
uh dairy londonderry it doesn't
 
01:35:11.210 --> 01:35:11.220 align:start position:0%
necessarily specific uh
 
01:35:11.220 --> 01:35:12.830 align:start position:0%
necessarily specific uh
[Music]

01:35:12.830 --> 01:35:12.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:35:14.210 --> 01:35:14.220 align:start position:0%
specifically um
 
01:35:14.220 --> 01:35:15.430 align:start position:0%
specifically um
[Music]

01:35:15.430 --> 01:35:15.440 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:35:17.750 --> 01:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
required the design build
 
01:35:20.550 --> 01:35:20.560 align:start position:0%
procurement but um it could be
 
01:35:23.030 --> 01:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
interpreted that way based on the the
 
01:35:25.270 --> 01:35:25.280 align:start position:0%
the description in other words
 
01:35:27.189 --> 01:35:27.199 align:start position:0%
is is
 
01:35:29.590 --> 01:35:29.600 align:start position:0%
i mean colloquially it's i think that is
 
01:35:32.070 --> 01:35:32.080 align:start position:0%
how it was referred to because it was
 
01:35:33.990 --> 01:35:34.000 align:start position:0%
being developed as a design build
 
01:35:35.750 --> 01:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
procurement so i think that's where the
 
01:35:37.669 --> 01:35:37.679 align:start position:0%
reference of the design build project
 
01:35:40.950 --> 01:35:40.960 align:start position:0%
named dairy londonderry but it doesn't
 
01:35:43.189 --> 01:35:43.199 align:start position:0%
uh and i think that's what i was trying
 
01:35:45.390 --> 01:35:45.400 align:start position:0%
to point out some of the maybe
 
01:35:47.590 --> 01:35:47.600 align:start position:0%
inconsistencies in the bill language
 
01:35:51.109 --> 01:35:51.119 align:start position:0%
that that um in a strict reading of the
 
01:35:52.229 --> 01:35:52.239 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:35:54.390 --> 01:35:54.400 align:start position:0%
exact language
 
01:35:56.390 --> 01:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
could be inconsistent
 
01:36:03.510 --> 01:36:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:04.950 --> 01:36:04.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:36:04.960 --> 01:36:06.070 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
um

01:36:06.070 --> 01:36:06.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:08.629 --> 01:36:08.639 align:start position:0%
my question would be about what
 
01:36:10.629 --> 01:36:10.639 align:start position:0%
might happen to the 10-year plan if we
 
01:36:11.990 --> 01:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
get a
 
01:36:15.189 --> 01:36:15.199 align:start position:0%
big increase in federal funding um
 
01:36:16.950 --> 01:36:16.960 align:start position:0%
is it just accelerate everything up or
 
01:36:18.870 --> 01:36:18.880 align:start position:0%
are we going to be picking projects out
 
01:36:21.350 --> 01:36:21.360 align:start position:0%
to move up the schedule based upon their
 
01:36:23.270 --> 01:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
they're being ready to go and is that
 
01:36:29.430 --> 01:36:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:33.270 --> 01:36:33.280 align:start position:0%
i don't think it will affect this
 
01:36:33.280 --> 01:36:34.310 align:start position:0%
i don't think it will affect this
project

01:36:34.310 --> 01:36:34.320 align:start position:0%
project
 
01:36:37.109 --> 01:36:37.119 align:start position:0%
i know even at the governor and council
 
01:36:39.910 --> 01:36:39.920 align:start position:0%
we've had some discussions um that came
 
01:36:42.870 --> 01:36:42.880 align:start position:0%
up from council of gatsas relative to
 
01:36:42.880 --> 01:36:43.990 align:start position:0%
up from council of gatsas relative to
um

01:36:43.990 --> 01:36:44.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:45.830 --> 01:36:45.840 align:start position:0%
you know potential earmark funding and
 
01:36:48.149 --> 01:36:48.159 align:start position:0%
thing things like that and and
 
01:36:50.629 --> 01:36:50.639 align:start position:0%
um while additional funding would
 
01:36:52.390 --> 01:36:52.400 align:start position:0%
certainly be welcome
 
01:36:56.390 --> 01:36:56.400 align:start position:0%
it is it is not as important in
 
01:36:58.709 --> 01:36:58.719 align:start position:0%
uh delivering this project at this point
 
01:37:00.470 --> 01:37:00.480 align:start position:0%
as completing the design in the
 
01:37:00.480 --> 01:37:01.910 align:start position:0%
as completing the design in the
right-of-way

01:37:01.910 --> 01:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
right-of-way
 
01:37:01.920 --> 01:37:03.590 align:start position:0%
right-of-way
um

01:37:03.590 --> 01:37:03.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:05.990 --> 01:37:06.000 align:start position:0%
process so it's not a funding constraint
 
01:37:07.990 --> 01:37:08.000 align:start position:0%
that is dictating the schedule that is
 
01:37:10.310 --> 01:37:10.320 align:start position:0%
part of the critical path here
 
01:37:12.470 --> 01:37:12.480 align:start position:0%
um so i guess that's the answer to the
 
01:37:13.990 --> 01:37:14.000 align:start position:0%
question and with regard to the 10-year
 
01:37:16.229 --> 01:37:16.239 align:start position:0%
plan um
 
01:37:17.110 --> 01:37:17.120 align:start position:0%
there is
 
01:37:17.120 --> 01:37:18.470 align:start position:0%
there is
[Music]

01:37:18.470 --> 01:37:18.480 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:37:20.550 --> 01:37:20.560 align:start position:0%
i hope we know more when we start those
 
01:37:22.310 --> 01:37:22.320 align:start position:0%
discussions you know this this summer
 
01:37:22.320 --> 01:37:23.350 align:start position:0%
discussions you know this this summer
about

01:37:23.350 --> 01:37:23.360 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:37:25.189 --> 01:37:25.199 align:start position:0%
where things are in washington and
 
01:37:26.790 --> 01:37:26.800 align:start position:0%
additional funding and stuff like that
 
01:37:27.910 --> 01:37:27.920 align:start position:0%
because there's
 
01:37:30.390 --> 01:37:30.400 align:start position:0%
been a lot of discussion but uh not a
 
01:37:44.950 --> 01:37:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:47.990 --> 01:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
good thank you
 
01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:48.870 align:start position:0%
good thank you
uh

01:37:48.870 --> 01:37:48.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:37:51.030 --> 01:37:51.040 align:start position:0%
there's mr david
 
01:37:54.470 --> 01:37:54.480 align:start position:0%
uh caring the town administrator gary
 
01:38:08.070 --> 01:38:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:09.669 --> 01:38:09.679 align:start position:0%
hi can you hear me
 
01:38:12.870 --> 01:38:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:15.430 --> 01:38:15.440 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm sorry my uh my feed is cut off
 
01:38:17.350 --> 01:38:17.360 align:start position:0%

thank
 
01:38:19.430 --> 01:38:19.440 align:start position:0%
the opportunity just to add some
 
01:38:21.669 --> 01:38:21.679 align:start position:0%
additional comments uh that senator
 
01:38:24.149 --> 01:38:24.159 align:start position:0%
blaisdell presented and bill cass as
 
01:38:24.159 --> 01:38:25.990 align:start position:0%
blaisdell presented and bill cass as
well

01:38:25.990 --> 01:38:26.000 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:38:27.750 --> 01:38:27.760 align:start position:0%
just for your information this project
 
01:38:29.590 --> 01:38:29.600 align:start position:0%
has been a transportation priority for
 
01:38:29.600 --> 01:38:30.709 align:start position:0%
has been a transportation priority for
towns

01:38:30.709 --> 01:38:30.719 align:start position:0%
towns
 
01:38:33.590 --> 01:38:33.600 align:start position:0%
of dairy and londonderry for decades
 
01:38:37.030 --> 01:38:37.040 align:start position:0%
it was in the federal record of decision
 
01:38:39.430 --> 01:38:39.440 align:start position:0%
there were two goals for this project
 
01:38:41.270 --> 01:38:41.280 align:start position:0%
one is to
 
01:38:43.270 --> 01:38:43.280 align:start position:0%
promote economic development for both
 
01:38:45.669 --> 01:38:45.679 align:start position:0%
communities and also to relieve
 
01:38:48.790 --> 01:38:48.800 align:start position:0%
congestion on route 102 which is uh east
 
01:38:50.149 --> 01:38:50.159 align:start position:0%
and west broadway here in derry which is
 
01:38:52.550 --> 01:38:52.560 align:start position:0%
our main through fair
 
01:38:52.560 --> 01:38:53.590 align:start position:0%
our main through fair
and

01:38:53.590 --> 01:38:53.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:38:55.669 --> 01:38:55.679 align:start position:0%
again not to repeat what uh what bill
 
01:38:57.910 --> 01:38:57.920 align:start position:0%
was speaking about but you know unlike
 
01:38:59.510 --> 01:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
any other project in new hampshire that
 
01:39:02.229 --> 01:39:02.239 align:start position:0%
has a regional transportation challenge
 
01:39:04.629 --> 01:39:04.639 align:start position:0%
uh the towns of derry and londonderry
 
01:39:06.310 --> 01:39:06.320 align:start position:0%
have each committed five million dollars
 
01:39:09.189 --> 01:39:09.199 align:start position:0%
in local dollars to this project
 
01:39:11.750 --> 01:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
we've gone from the conceptual stage
 
01:39:13.669 --> 01:39:13.679 align:start position:0%
from over three decades ago to nearing
 
01:39:13.679 --> 01:39:14.950 align:start position:0%
from over three decades ago to nearing
construction

01:39:14.950 --> 01:39:14.960 align:start position:0%
construction
 
01:39:14.960 --> 01:39:16.550 align:start position:0%
construction
and

01:39:16.550 --> 01:39:16.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:39:20.790 --> 01:39:20.800 align:start position:0%
our our concerns are a couple of uh one
 
01:39:22.390 --> 01:39:22.400 align:start position:0%
is that we think it'd be critically
 
01:39:24.870 --> 01:39:24.880 align:start position:0%
important to have the legislative intent
 
01:39:26.709 --> 01:39:26.719 align:start position:0%
that this project moved forward to
 
01:39:29.270 --> 01:39:29.280 align:start position:0%
completion as soon as possible
 
01:39:31.430 --> 01:39:31.440 align:start position:0%
the towns recognize
 
01:39:33.830 --> 01:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
and agree with bill's position that
 
01:39:36.470 --> 01:39:36.480 align:start position:0%
final construction will not be completed
 
01:39:39.030 --> 01:39:39.040 align:start position:0%
until 2026.
 
01:39:40.629 --> 01:39:40.639 align:start position:0%
that's just the position we find
 
01:39:42.149 --> 01:39:42.159 align:start position:0%
ourselves in after
 
01:39:44.950 --> 01:39:44.960 align:start position:0%
the design bill process was completed
 
01:39:48.629 --> 01:39:48.639 align:start position:0%
with the unfortunate cost overrun
 
01:39:48.639 --> 01:39:49.750 align:start position:0%
with the unfortunate cost overrun
so

01:39:49.750 --> 01:39:49.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:39:52.470 --> 01:39:52.480 align:start position:0%
our recommendation is that the committee
 
01:39:56.470 --> 01:39:56.480 align:start position:0%
amend the completion date to 2026
 
01:39:59.030 --> 01:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
that would send a message to the next
 
01:40:01.990 --> 01:40:02.000 align:start position:0%
year's 10-year highway transportation
 
01:40:04.070 --> 01:40:04.080 align:start position:0%
process that this project remains a
 
01:40:06.390 --> 01:40:06.400 align:start position:0%
priority of the legislature and the
 
01:40:06.400 --> 01:40:07.590 align:start position:0%
priority of the legislature and the
communities

01:40:07.590 --> 01:40:07.600 align:start position:0%
communities
 
01:40:07.600 --> 01:40:08.709 align:start position:0%
communities
and

01:40:08.709 --> 01:40:08.719 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:40:10.790 --> 01:40:10.800 align:start position:0%
my last comment is is that
 
01:40:12.629 --> 01:40:12.639 align:start position:0%
bill correct me from wrong but i think
 
01:40:14.390 --> 01:40:14.400 align:start position:0%
actually the construction
 
01:40:16.709 --> 01:40:16.719 align:start position:0%
project is now viewed as being in three
 
01:40:16.719 --> 01:40:18.310 align:start position:0%
project is now viewed as being in three
phases

01:40:18.310 --> 01:40:18.320 align:start position:0%
phases
 
01:40:20.070 --> 01:40:20.080 align:start position:0%
the first phase will probably be most
 
01:40:21.430 --> 01:40:21.440 align:start position:0%
visible to
 
01:40:23.590 --> 01:40:23.600 align:start position:0%
the traveling public with a connection
 
01:40:25.350 --> 01:40:25.360 align:start position:0%
with i-93
 
01:40:28.229 --> 01:40:28.239 align:start position:0%
the second and third phases include uh
 
01:40:31.109 --> 01:40:31.119 align:start position:0%
construction and segments into
 
01:40:33.430 --> 01:40:33.440 align:start position:0%
local roads and dairy which will be part
 
01:40:36.550 --> 01:40:36.560 align:start position:0%
of the 4a corridor and our concern is
 
01:40:39.270 --> 01:40:39.280 align:start position:0%
that without legislative backing
 
01:40:40.950 --> 01:40:40.960 align:start position:0%
i'm concerned if there are additional
 
01:40:42.629 --> 01:40:42.639 align:start position:0%
cost overruns
 
01:40:45.109 --> 01:40:45.119 align:start position:0%
the third phase may be in jeopardy
 
01:40:47.990 --> 01:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
and if that occurs in a third way third
 
01:40:49.990 --> 01:40:50.000 align:start position:0%
phase is either not constructed or
 
01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:51.109 align:start position:0%
phase is either not constructed or
delayed

01:40:51.109 --> 01:40:51.119 align:start position:0%
delayed
 
01:40:53.109 --> 01:40:53.119 align:start position:0%
that would simply
 
01:40:56.149 --> 01:40:56.159 align:start position:0%
transfer a current congested traffic
 
01:40:58.950 --> 01:40:58.960 align:start position:0%
situation downtown to a separate part of
 
01:41:00.229 --> 01:41:00.239 align:start position:0%
derry so
 
01:41:01.830 --> 01:41:01.840 align:start position:0%
again in closing i thank you for your
 
01:41:03.510 --> 01:41:03.520 align:start position:0%
time and i think it'd be incredibly
 
01:41:05.350 --> 01:41:05.360 align:start position:0%
beneficial to have a legislature go on
 
01:41:07.990 --> 01:41:08.000 align:start position:0%
record as having this project as a state
 
01:41:09.990 --> 01:41:10.000 align:start position:0%
transportation priority and to be
 
01:41:12.709 --> 01:41:12.719 align:start position:0%
completed by 2026. thank you for your
 
01:41:12.719 --> 01:41:14.390 align:start position:0%
completed by 2026. thank you for your
time

01:41:14.390 --> 01:41:14.400 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:41:17.750 --> 01:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any
 
01:41:21.430 --> 01:41:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:27.590 --> 01:41:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:31.270 --> 01:41:31.280 align:start position:0%
people wishing to testify that i have
 
01:41:32.390 --> 01:41:32.400 align:start position:0%
nobody else
 
01:41:32.400 --> 01:41:33.910 align:start position:0%
nobody else
under

01:41:33.910 --> 01:41:33.920 align:start position:0%
under
 
01:41:36.470 --> 01:41:36.480 align:start position:0%
um the attendees will raise their hand
 
01:41:37.990 --> 01:41:38.000 align:start position:0%
to testify
 
01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:39.189 align:start position:0%
to testify
um

01:41:39.189 --> 01:41:39.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:41.669 --> 01:41:41.679 align:start position:0%
with that i will close the hearing on
 
01:41:44.830 --> 01:41:44.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:50.709 --> 01:41:50.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:52.870 --> 01:41:52.880 align:start position:0%
just want to say a couple things with
 
01:41:54.950 --> 01:41:54.960 align:start position:0%
this is within the other bill that we
 
01:41:57.350 --> 01:41:57.360 align:start position:0%
have in front of us
 
01:41:59.750 --> 01:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
we have four choices
 
01:42:02.550 --> 01:42:02.560 align:start position:0%
we can pass the bill as is
 
01:42:04.709 --> 01:42:04.719 align:start position:0%
we can find the bill in expedient
 
01:42:04.719 --> 01:42:06.390 align:start position:0%
we can find the bill in expedient
legislate

01:42:06.390 --> 01:42:06.400 align:start position:0%
legislate
 
01:42:09.109 --> 01:42:09.119 align:start position:0%
we can amend the bill as suggested by mr
 
01:42:09.119 --> 01:42:10.950 align:start position:0%
we can amend the bill as suggested by mr
karen

01:42:10.950 --> 01:42:10.960 align:start position:0%
karen
 
01:42:13.430 --> 01:42:13.440 align:start position:0%
or we can retain the bill and make sure
 
01:42:16.310 --> 01:42:16.320 align:start position:0%
it gets put into the 10-year plan
 
01:42:20.470 --> 01:42:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:22.149 --> 01:42:22.159 align:start position:0%
if we were to
 
01:42:24.709 --> 01:42:24.719 align:start position:0%
go with the amended
 
01:42:24.719 --> 01:42:26.229 align:start position:0%
go with the amended
option

01:42:26.229 --> 01:42:26.239 align:start position:0%
option
 
01:42:27.910 --> 01:42:27.920 align:start position:0%
we're not going to get that done today
 
01:42:27.920 --> 01:42:29.109 align:start position:0%
we're not going to get that done today
obviously

01:42:29.109 --> 01:42:29.119 align:start position:0%
obviously
 
01:42:32.470 --> 01:42:32.480 align:start position:0%
um just for the committee's um
 
01:42:35.430 --> 01:42:35.440 align:start position:0%
information i have scheduled
 
01:42:38.629 --> 01:42:38.639 align:start position:0%
um the 19th of may for any executive
 
01:42:42.390 --> 01:42:42.400 align:start position:0%
sessions that we don't get finished
 
01:42:42.400 --> 01:42:43.830 align:start position:0%
sessions that we don't get finished
so

01:42:43.830 --> 01:42:43.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:42:45.270 --> 01:42:45.280 align:start position:0%
that said
 
01:42:48.149 --> 01:42:48.159 align:start position:0%
before we opened up promotion
 
01:42:53.109 --> 01:42:53.119 align:start position:0%
um does any of the committee have
 
01:42:54.550 --> 01:42:54.560 align:start position:0%
something they would like to say about
 
01:42:58.870 --> 01:42:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:03.350 --> 01:43:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:05.350 --> 01:43:05.360 align:start position:0%
yes uh it seems like there's a lot of
 
01:43:05.360 --> 01:43:06.790 align:start position:0%
yes uh it seems like there's a lot of
questions

01:43:06.790 --> 01:43:06.800 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:43:08.550 --> 01:43:08.560 align:start position:0%
with this bill
 
01:43:08.560 --> 01:43:09.350 align:start position:0%
with this bill
in

01:43:09.350 --> 01:43:09.360 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:43:11.430 --> 01:43:11.440 align:start position:0%
the biggest concern of mine is how it's
 
01:43:13.270 --> 01:43:13.280 align:start position:0%
going to be paid
 
01:43:16.070 --> 01:43:16.080 align:start position:0%
and i think that uh referring it to
 
01:43:18.870 --> 01:43:18.880 align:start position:0%
interim study or retaining it would be
 
01:43:21.590 --> 01:43:21.600 align:start position:0%
the wise choice to do because
 
01:43:24.550 --> 01:43:24.560 align:start position:0%
it keeps the pressure on the d.o.t
 
01:43:27.350 --> 01:43:27.360 align:start position:0%
and we would have plenty of time
 
01:43:29.910 --> 01:43:29.920 align:start position:0%
to make a decision to add it to the
 
01:43:32.390 --> 01:43:32.400 align:start position:0%
10-year plan or do some other
 
01:43:34.470 --> 01:43:34.480 align:start position:0%
alternative action
 
01:43:37.430 --> 01:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
for the second half of our session so i
 
01:43:40.709 --> 01:43:40.719 align:start position:0%
would certainly support uh emotion
 
01:43:43.109 --> 01:43:43.119 align:start position:0%
in that aspect and i think it would be
 
01:43:47.830 --> 01:43:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:51.510 --> 01:43:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:54.550 --> 01:43:54.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um
 
01:43:57.350 --> 01:43:57.360 align:start position:0%
i think it would be highly unusual for
 
01:44:00.310 --> 01:44:00.320 align:start position:0%
our committee to recommend ought to pass
 
01:44:01.830 --> 01:44:01.840 align:start position:0%
on um
 
01:44:04.310 --> 01:44:04.320 align:start position:0%
on a bill such as this which is out of
 
01:44:06.629 --> 01:44:06.639 align:start position:0%
cycle with the 10-year plan
 
01:44:08.790 --> 01:44:08.800 align:start position:0%
our tradition
 
01:44:10.790 --> 01:44:10.800 align:start position:0%
at least in my experience has always
 
01:44:13.030 --> 01:44:13.040 align:start position:0%
been to retain
 
01:44:15.109 --> 01:44:15.119 align:start position:0%
a bill such as this
 
01:44:15.119 --> 01:44:16.229 align:start position:0%
a bill such as this
i

01:44:16.229 --> 01:44:16.239 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:44:19.350 --> 01:44:19.360 align:start position:0%
find it challenging to pass a bill
 
01:44:22.470 --> 01:44:22.480 align:start position:0%
um especially in its current uh the way
 
01:44:25.109 --> 01:44:25.119 align:start position:0%
it's currently set up that we're
 
01:44:28.070 --> 01:44:28.080 align:start position:0%
i i wouldn't want to pass a bill that's
 
01:44:31.430 --> 01:44:31.440 align:start position:0%
impossible to achieve just to indicate
 
01:44:34.550 --> 01:44:34.560 align:start position:0%
legislative intent
 
01:44:37.030 --> 01:44:37.040 align:start position:0%
we have the hearing
 
01:44:39.109 --> 01:44:39.119 align:start position:0%
record from the senate we have the
 
01:44:41.109 --> 01:44:41.119 align:start position:0%
hearing record today
 
01:44:41.119 --> 01:44:41.990 align:start position:0%
hearing record today
the

01:44:41.990 --> 01:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:44:44.550 --> 01:44:44.560 align:start position:0%
gasset process will also give these
 
01:44:47.430 --> 01:44:47.440 align:start position:0%
towns an ample opportunity to represent
 
01:44:49.510 --> 01:44:49.520 align:start position:0%
their interests
 
01:44:50.550 --> 01:44:50.560 align:start position:0%
this is
 
01:44:53.030 --> 01:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
such vital importance it's hard for me
 
01:44:55.510 --> 01:44:55.520 align:start position:0%
to believe that it wouldn't ultimately
 
01:44:57.669 --> 01:44:57.679 align:start position:0%
make it into the draft 10-year plan
 
01:44:59.510 --> 01:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
that's presented to us
 
01:45:02.310 --> 01:45:02.320 align:start position:0%
and for all those reasons i would have a
 
01:45:05.030 --> 01:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
hard time supporting anything but
 
01:45:07.350 --> 01:45:07.360 align:start position:0%
a motion to retain this bill
 
01:45:12.310 --> 01:45:12.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:12.320 --> 01:45:13.430 align:start position:0%
 
any

01:45:13.430 --> 01:45:13.440 align:start position:0%
any
 
01:45:16.390 --> 01:45:16.400 align:start position:0%
further discussion before right let's
 
01:45:21.030 --> 01:45:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:22.950 --> 01:45:22.960 align:start position:0%
if not what is the pleasure of the
 
01:45:22.960 --> 01:45:26.550 align:start position:0%
if not what is the pleasure of the
committee

01:45:26.550 --> 01:45:26.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:26.560 --> 01:45:28.629 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:45:28.629 --> 01:45:28.639 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:45:31.590 --> 01:45:31.600 align:start position:0%
i need to retain uh senate bill
 
01:45:31.600 --> 01:45:33.430 align:start position:0%
i need to retain uh senate bill
116.

01:45:33.430 --> 01:45:33.440 align:start position:0%
116.
 
01:45:35.590 --> 01:45:35.600 align:start position:0%
second the second proof by
 
01:45:38.229 --> 01:45:38.239 align:start position:0%
representative clutier seconded by
 
01:45:40.390 --> 01:45:40.400 align:start position:0%
representative mcconkey that the
 
01:45:48.629 --> 01:45:48.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:50.390 --> 01:45:50.400 align:start position:0%
i agree wholeheartedly with
 
01:45:52.470 --> 01:45:52.480 align:start position:0%
representative ebel on the reasons for
 
01:45:53.910 --> 01:45:53.920 align:start position:0%
retaining bill i think this is a
 
01:45:56.070 --> 01:45:56.080 align:start position:0%
worthwhile project but i'm concerned i
 
01:45:57.830 --> 01:45:57.840 align:start position:0%
would not want to pass the bill
 
01:45:59.910 --> 01:45:59.920 align:start position:0%
definitely the more i have some
 
01:46:02.709 --> 01:46:02.719 align:start position:0%
questions but i think if we retain it
 
01:46:04.390 --> 01:46:04.400 align:start position:0%
we have according to the house counter
 
01:46:06.870 --> 01:46:06.880 align:start position:0%
we have until november 18th you know we
 
01:46:08.149 --> 01:46:08.159 align:start position:0%
thought there's such report that we
 
01:46:10.149 --> 01:46:10.159 align:start position:0%
could pass it then and hopefully we're
 
01:46:12.390 --> 01:46:12.400 align:start position:0%
going to have a clearer picture
 
01:46:13.990 --> 01:46:14.000 align:start position:0%
of how much federal money hopefully
 
01:46:15.430 --> 01:46:15.440 align:start position:0%
we're going to get from the
 
01:46:17.350 --> 01:46:17.360 align:start position:0%
infrastructure which i i think is going
 
01:46:19.030 --> 01:46:19.040 align:start position:0%
to pass sometime this summer or
 
01:46:21.189 --> 01:46:21.199 align:start position:0%
certainly early fall and i think it's
 
01:46:22.550 --> 01:46:22.560 align:start position:0%
going to it may not be what the
 
01:46:24.070 --> 01:46:24.080 align:start position:0%
president exactly wants but i think it's
 
01:46:26.310 --> 01:46:26.320 align:start position:0%
going to be for real roads bridges et
 
01:46:28.070 --> 01:46:28.080 align:start position:0%
cetera that's my fault
 
01:46:30.070 --> 01:46:30.080 align:start position:0%
i think we need to wait on this but i
 
01:46:32.390 --> 01:46:32.400 align:start position:0%
think our intent is this is an important
 
01:46:34.550 --> 01:46:34.560 align:start position:0%
project so i expect in the end i'm going
 
01:46:36.870 --> 01:46:36.880 align:start position:0%
to vote for tank that has this project
 
01:46:39.030 --> 01:46:39.040 align:start position:0%
and gets it done as soon as possible but
 
01:46:40.390 --> 01:46:40.400 align:start position:0%
i think we need to retain it to make
 
01:46:41.830 --> 01:46:41.840 align:start position:0%
sure there's pressure
 
01:46:43.350 --> 01:46:43.360 align:start position:0%
on the d.o.t
 
01:46:49.189 --> 01:46:49.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:50.950 --> 01:46:50.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:46:53.510 --> 01:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
i agree with my fellow committee members
 
01:46:55.030 --> 01:46:55.040 align:start position:0%
but i'd just like to say
 
01:46:57.430 --> 01:46:57.440 align:start position:0%
i understand the eggs here with dairy
 
01:47:00.149 --> 01:47:00.159 align:start position:0%
and londonderry how long projects take
 
01:47:02.229 --> 01:47:02.239 align:start position:0%
but i wanna i wanna commend the
 
01:47:04.390 --> 01:47:04.400 align:start position:0%
department here of pulling back and
 
01:47:04.400 --> 01:47:05.430 align:start position:0%
department here of pulling back and
looking

01:47:05.430 --> 01:47:05.440 align:start position:0%
looking
 
01:47:07.750 --> 01:47:07.760 align:start position:0%
at an alternative way to get this
 
01:47:10.870 --> 01:47:10.880 align:start position:0%
project done in a reasonable manner
 
01:47:13.590 --> 01:47:13.600 align:start position:0%
and it's my hope between that keeping
 
01:47:15.430 --> 01:47:15.440 align:start position:0%
this retained
 
01:47:17.669 --> 01:47:17.679 align:start position:0%
that it will work out best for the towns
 
01:47:17.679 --> 01:47:22.470 align:start position:0%
that it will work out best for the towns
and

01:47:22.470 --> 01:47:22.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:24.149 --> 01:47:24.159 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
01:47:26.229 --> 01:47:26.239 align:start position:0%
i do have one thing for members of the
 
01:47:26.239 --> 01:47:27.189 align:start position:0%
i do have one thing for members of the
committee

01:47:27.189 --> 01:47:27.199 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:47:27.199 --> 01:47:28.229 align:start position:0%
committee
that

01:47:28.229 --> 01:47:28.239 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:47:28.239 --> 01:47:29.350 align:start position:0%
that
by

01:47:29.350 --> 01:47:29.360 align:start position:0%
by
 
01:47:31.590 --> 01:47:31.600 align:start position:0%
late fall when we will have to report
 
01:47:33.030 --> 01:47:33.040 align:start position:0%
this bill out
 
01:47:34.550 --> 01:47:34.560 align:start position:0%
we will have a
 
01:47:36.390 --> 01:47:36.400 align:start position:0%
fairly clear picture
 
01:47:38.629 --> 01:47:38.639 align:start position:0%
of what will be in the 10-year plan the
 
01:47:41.109 --> 01:47:41.119 align:start position:0%
gas appearance will be essentially
 
01:47:41.119 --> 01:47:42.229 align:start position:0%
gas appearance will be essentially
completed

01:47:42.229 --> 01:47:42.239 align:start position:0%
completed
 
01:47:44.709 --> 01:47:44.719 align:start position:0%
and we can
 
01:47:46.790 --> 01:47:46.800 align:start position:0%
if we're not happy with what's in there
 
01:47:48.310 --> 01:47:48.320 align:start position:0%
that we could fix
 
01:47:51.510 --> 01:47:51.520 align:start position:0%
this bill and vote on it in january
 
01:47:53.590 --> 01:47:53.600 align:start position:0%
um it's not going to change what happens
 
01:47:57.830 --> 01:47:57.840 align:start position:0%
this year um with the agreed plan as the
 
01:47:59.910 --> 01:47:59.920 align:start position:0%
town administrator said with the agreed
 
01:48:02.390 --> 01:48:02.400 align:start position:0%
upon uh
 
01:48:04.629 --> 01:48:04.639 align:start position:0%
timeline that's been laid out now to
 
01:48:06.870 --> 01:48:06.880 align:start position:0%
take it through 2026.
 
01:48:10.070 --> 01:48:10.080 align:start position:0%
and i do agree with representatives uh
 
01:48:12.390 --> 01:48:12.400 align:start position:0%
people including are about um holding
 
01:48:13.910 --> 01:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
their feet for the fire as well as
 
01:48:13.920 --> 01:48:15.590 align:start position:0%
their feet for the fire as well as
representative

01:48:15.590 --> 01:48:15.600 align:start position:0%

of the committee
 
03:15:02.550 --> 03:15:02.560 align:start position:0%
about two years ago i was asked by the
 
03:15:04.389 --> 03:15:04.399 align:start position:0%
haverhill board of selectmen it's one of
 
03:15:06.469 --> 03:15:06.479 align:start position:0%
the towns in the 27 town district that i
 
03:15:06.479 --> 03:15:07.830 align:start position:0%
the towns in the 27 town district that i
represent

03:15:07.830 --> 03:15:07.840 align:start position:0%
represent
 
03:15:10.070 --> 03:15:10.080 align:start position:0%
to chair a meeting between the board
 
03:15:11.349 --> 03:15:11.359 align:start position:0%
and the woodsville fire precinct
 
03:15:11.359 --> 03:15:13.190 align:start position:0%
and the woodsville fire precinct
commissioners

03:15:13.190 --> 03:15:13.200 align:start position:0%
commissioners
 
03:15:15.349 --> 03:15:15.359 align:start position:0%
this meeting was intended to explore
 
03:15:17.830 --> 03:15:17.840 align:start position:0%
changing the state mandated formula
 
03:15:19.349 --> 03:15:19.359 align:start position:0%
that dictates
 
03:15:20.790 --> 03:15:20.800 align:start position:0%
the raising and appropriation of
 
03:15:23.030 --> 03:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
behavioral tax dollars
 
03:15:24.950 --> 03:15:24.960 align:start position:0%
and transfer of those dollars to the
 
03:15:27.269 --> 03:15:27.279 align:start position:0%
woodsville fire precinct for maintenance
 
03:15:29.429 --> 03:15:29.439 align:start position:0%
of the precincts roads
 
03:15:31.190 --> 03:15:31.200 align:start position:0%
but the discussion ended when the
 
03:15:33.510 --> 03:15:33.520 align:start position:0%
commissioners of the precinct
 
03:15:35.750 --> 03:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
basically pointed to the state law
 
03:15:37.590 --> 03:15:37.600 align:start position:0%
and refused to discuss any meaningful
 
03:15:39.990 --> 03:15:40.000 align:start position:0%
change to the formula
 
03:15:42.070 --> 03:15:42.080 align:start position:0%
it is that law that section one of this
 
03:15:45.670 --> 03:15:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:47.510 --> 03:15:47.520 align:start position:0%
current state law dictates a formula
 
03:15:49.990 --> 03:15:50.000 align:start position:0%
that requires haverhill taxpayers
 
03:15:52.150 --> 03:15:52.160 align:start position:0%
to raise and appropriate funds for the
 
03:15:53.510 --> 03:15:53.520 align:start position:0%
highway department of the woodsville
 
03:15:55.349 --> 03:15:55.359 align:start position:0%
fire precinct
 
03:15:57.110 --> 03:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
it requires haverhill to pay the fire
 
03:15:59.030 --> 03:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
precinct over fifty thousand dollars a
 
03:15:59.040 --> 03:16:00.070 align:start position:0%
precinct over fifty thousand dollars a
mile

03:16:00.070 --> 03:16:00.080 align:start position:0%
mile
 
03:16:02.870 --> 03:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
roughly five times the 9 500 per mile
 
03:16:04.710 --> 03:16:04.720 align:start position:0%
that it costs haverhill to maintain its
 
03:16:07.190 --> 03:16:07.200 align:start position:0%
own roads
 
03:16:09.190 --> 03:16:09.200 align:start position:0%
consider that this state law requires
 
03:16:11.590 --> 03:16:11.600 align:start position:0%
one political subdivision to fund the
 
03:16:13.830 --> 03:16:13.840 align:start position:0%
highway department of another
 
03:16:15.349 --> 03:16:15.359 align:start position:0%
that's no different than your town being
 
03:16:17.830 --> 03:16:17.840 align:start position:0%
told by state government and state law
 
03:16:19.030 --> 03:16:19.040 align:start position:0%
that it has to fund the highway
 
03:16:20.469 --> 03:16:20.479 align:start position:0%
department of one of your adjoining
 
03:16:20.479 --> 03:16:21.750 align:start position:0%
department of one of your adjoining
towns

03:16:21.750 --> 03:16:21.760 align:start position:0%
towns
 
03:16:23.990 --> 03:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
it is an egregious violation of every
 
03:16:27.349 --> 03:16:27.359 align:start position:0%
tenant of local control
 
03:16:28.790 --> 03:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
opponents of this legislation will
 
03:16:30.150 --> 03:16:30.160 align:start position:0%
cleverly ask you to kill it in the
 
03:16:32.469 --> 03:16:32.479 align:start position:0%
interest of maintaining local control
 
03:16:33.670 --> 03:16:33.680 align:start position:0%
knowing the respect we in the
 
03:16:35.190 --> 03:16:35.200 align:start position:0%
legislature hold to this fundamental
 
03:16:38.309 --> 03:16:38.319 align:start position:0%
prim premise of new hampshire governance
 
03:16:40.870 --> 03:16:40.880 align:start position:0%
the law we're asking you to amend today
 
03:16:42.550 --> 03:16:42.560 align:start position:0%
mandates that the taxpayers of one
 
03:16:44.870 --> 03:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
political subdivision haverhill raises
 
03:16:46.550 --> 03:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
an appropriate local funds to pay for
 
03:16:47.830 --> 03:16:47.840 align:start position:0%
the operating expenses of another
 
03:16:49.269 --> 03:16:49.279 align:start position:0%
political subdivision the woodsville
 
03:16:50.790 --> 03:16:50.800 align:start position:0%
fire precinct
 
03:16:52.630 --> 03:16:52.640 align:start position:0%
making matters even worse
 
03:16:54.550 --> 03:16:54.560 align:start position:0%
the state law requires approval of any
 
03:16:55.910 --> 03:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
changes to the current financial
 
03:16:55.920 --> 03:16:57.429 align:start position:0%
changes to the current financial
arrangement

03:16:57.429 --> 03:16:57.439 align:start position:0%
arrangement
 
03:16:59.269 --> 03:16:59.279 align:start position:0%
to gain the approval of the legislature
 
03:17:01.269 --> 03:17:01.279 align:start position:0%
and the governor
 
03:17:02.710 --> 03:17:02.720 align:start position:0%
honorable members of the committee this
 
03:17:04.950 --> 03:17:04.960 align:start position:0%
is not local control
 
03:17:07.349 --> 03:17:07.359 align:start position:0%
rather this law preempts local control
 
03:17:09.110 --> 03:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
and eliminates any semblance of good
 
03:17:11.190 --> 03:17:11.200 align:start position:0%
faith negotiations as demonstrated by
 
03:17:13.429 --> 03:17:13.439 align:start position:0%
the ongoing refusal of the precinct to
 
03:17:15.030 --> 03:17:15.040 align:start position:0%
make any substantial changes to the
 
03:17:17.429 --> 03:17:17.439 align:start position:0%
grossly lopsided state mandated funding
 
03:17:17.439 --> 03:17:18.870 align:start position:0%
grossly lopsided state mandated funding
formula

03:17:18.870 --> 03:17:18.880 align:start position:0%
formula
 
03:17:21.110 --> 03:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
without passage of this legislation
 
03:17:23.190 --> 03:17:23.200 align:start position:0%
local control does not exist
 
03:17:25.030 --> 03:17:25.040 align:start position:0%
because state law
 
03:17:25.040 --> 03:17:26.790 align:start position:0%
because state law
governs

03:17:26.790 --> 03:17:26.800 align:start position:0%
governs
 
03:17:29.429 --> 03:17:29.439 align:start position:0%
this situation

03:17:33.110 --> 03:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
at a cost to wizville taxpayers of
 
03:17:35.830 --> 03:17:35.840 align:start position:0%
almost ten thousand dollars so far
 
03:17:37.590 --> 03:17:37.600 align:start position:0%
asks for time to allow the parties to
 
03:17:39.510 --> 03:17:39.520 align:start position:0%
resolve their differences
 
03:17:40.950 --> 03:17:40.960 align:start position:0%
but those differences will never be
 
03:17:43.030 --> 03:17:43.040 align:start position:0%
resolved so long as this law protects
 
03:17:44.870 --> 03:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
the state mandated gravy train for
 
03:17:47.110 --> 03:17:47.120 align:start position:0%
woodsville which disenfranchises the
 
03:17:48.630 --> 03:17:48.640 align:start position:0%
citizens of behavioral from voting on
 
03:17:50.150 --> 03:17:50.160 align:start position:0%
the funds that are required by state law
 
03:17:52.630 --> 03:17:52.640 align:start position:0%
to raise and appropriate every year
 
03:17:55.269 --> 03:17:55.279 align:start position:0%
for the different political subdivision
 
03:17:56.790 --> 03:17:56.800 align:start position:0%
i ask you
 
03:17:58.309 --> 03:17:58.319 align:start position:0%
is this a law that you would support if
 
03:17:59.990 --> 03:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
your town was the donor town funding
 
03:18:03.510 --> 03:18:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:05.269 --> 03:18:05.279 align:start position:0%
sadly this issue has fostered deep
 
03:18:07.349 --> 03:18:07.359 align:start position:0%
division within the community
 
03:18:08.870 --> 03:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
failure to amend the statute will
 
03:18:10.309 --> 03:18:10.319 align:start position:0%
perpetuate that division for the
 
03:18:11.830 --> 03:18:11.840 align:start position:0%
foreseeable future
 
03:18:13.429 --> 03:18:13.439 align:start position:0%
and the state's continued interference
 
03:18:15.110 --> 03:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
in this local budget issue will continue
 
03:18:17.030 --> 03:18:17.040 align:start position:0%
to prevent its resolution at the local
 
03:18:21.269 --> 03:18:21.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:22.950 --> 03:18:22.960 align:start position:0%
section two of the bill was requested by
 
03:18:25.110 --> 03:18:25.120 align:start position:0%
the department of revenue administration
 
03:18:26.550 --> 03:18:26.560 align:start position:0%
in response to the woodsville fire
 
03:18:28.630 --> 03:18:28.640 align:start position:0%
precinct's refusal year after year to
 
03:18:30.309 --> 03:18:30.319 align:start position:0%
perform the annual audit required of
 
03:18:32.550 --> 03:18:32.560 align:start position:0%
every political subdivision in the state
 
03:18:34.630 --> 03:18:34.640 align:start position:0%
despite dozens of emails phone messages
 
03:18:35.990 --> 03:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
and conversations asking the
 
03:18:38.309 --> 03:18:38.319 align:start position:0%
commissioners to comply with the law
 
03:18:39.510 --> 03:18:39.520 align:start position:0%
the department will speak to this
 
03:18:42.710 --> 03:18:42.720 align:start position:0%
section in subsequent testimony
 
03:18:45.110 --> 03:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
and finally as an adjunct to this bill
 
03:18:46.469 --> 03:18:46.479 align:start position:0%
it's instructive to note that the
 
03:18:47.990 --> 03:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
attorney general recently found the
 
03:18:49.670 --> 03:18:49.680 align:start position:0%
current administrator of the woodsville
 
03:18:51.590 --> 03:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
fire precinct guilty of violating
 
03:18:52.790 --> 03:18:52.800 align:start position:0%
election law
 
03:18:54.229 --> 03:18:54.239 align:start position:0%
by using fronts from one of the
 
03:18:56.229 --> 03:18:56.239 align:start position:0%
precincts four enterprises to mail to
 
03:18:58.389 --> 03:18:58.399 align:start position:0%
every electric and water customer
 
03:19:00.469 --> 03:19:00.479 align:start position:0%
in its purview a letter advocating
 
03:19:01.750 --> 03:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
against an article in this year's
 
03:19:03.510 --> 03:19:03.520 align:start position:0%
haverhill town warrant
 
03:19:06.389 --> 03:19:06.399 align:start position:0%
that's electioneering plain and simple
 
03:19:07.590 --> 03:19:07.600 align:start position:0%
the attorney general is also
 
03:19:09.190 --> 03:19:09.200 align:start position:0%
investigating additional election law
 
03:19:11.910 --> 03:19:11.920 align:start position:0%
violations for this last march
 
03:19:13.830 --> 03:19:13.840 align:start position:0%
town meeting as well as reviewing the
 
03:19:15.349 --> 03:19:15.359 align:start position:0%
financial operations of the woodsville
 
03:19:17.190 --> 03:19:17.200 align:start position:0%
fire precinct for possible violations of
 
03:19:19.190 --> 03:19:19.200 align:start position:0%
state law
 
03:19:21.190 --> 03:19:21.200 align:start position:0%
the multi-year audit mandated in section
 
03:19:23.269 --> 03:19:23.279 align:start position:0%
2 of this bill has already identified
 
03:19:25.110 --> 03:19:25.120 align:start position:0%
although not yet complete
 
03:19:26.870 --> 03:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
several violations of both the municipal
 
03:19:28.950 --> 03:19:28.960 align:start position:0%
budget act and the municipal finance
 
03:19:28.960 --> 03:19:30.070 align:start position:0%

statutes

03:19:30.070 --> 03:19:30.080 align:start position:0%
statutes
 
03:19:32.150 --> 03:19:32.160 align:start position:0%
in addition the audit disclosed an
 
03:19:33.910 --> 03:19:33.920 align:start position:0%
11-year period of potential fraud
 
03:19:35.110 --> 03:19:35.120 align:start position:0%
against the new hampshire retirement
 
03:19:36.389 --> 03:19:36.399 align:start position:0%

03:19:38.229 --> 03:19:38.239 align:start position:0%

03:19:43.910 --> 03:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
but reporting significantly less to the
 
03:19:45.670 --> 03:19:45.680 align:start position:0%
state so that the employee could
 
03:19:47.429 --> 03:19:47.439 align:start position:0%
continue to collect his state retirement
 
03:19:47.439 --> 03:19:49.269 align:start position:0%

03:20:27.830 --> 03:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
i will not be able to pursue uh to
 
03:20:29.910 --> 03:20:29.920 align:start position:0%

i have about 15 people
 
03:20:41.590 --> 03:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
who have asked to testify
 
03:20:43.750 --> 03:20:43.760 align:start position:0%
i would ask everybody whether you're in
 
03:20:46.469 --> 03:20:46.479 align:start position:0%
support or opposition to the bill
 
03:20:48.389 --> 03:20:48.399 align:start position:0%
to be concise
 
03:20:50.790 --> 03:20:50.800 align:start position:0%
and if somebody has already said what
 
03:20:53.030 --> 03:20:53.040 align:start position:0%
you were planning on saying
 
03:20:55.190 --> 03:20:55.200 align:start position:0%
not repeat that
 
03:20:58.070 --> 03:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
it is difficult enough for
 
03:21:00.630 --> 03:21:00.640 align:start position:0%
all of the members
 
03:21:03.750 --> 03:21:03.760 align:start position:0%

to keep track and it
 
03:21:12.550 --> 03:21:12.560 align:start position:0%
would just make things go a little
 
03:21:16.389 --> 03:21:16.399 align:start position:0%
smoother so that we can make a a logical
 
03:21:16.399 --> 03:21:17.830 align:start position:0%
smoother so that we can make a a logical
decision

03:21:17.830 --> 03:21:17.840 align:start position:0%
decision
 
03:21:17.840 --> 03:21:18.710 align:start position:0%
decision
um

03:21:18.710 --> 03:21:18.720 align:start position:0%

03:21:34.150 --> 03:21:34.160 align:start position:0%
and if you can everybody could identify
 
03:21:36.790 --> 03:21:36.800 align:start position:0%
themselves and who they represent if
 
03:21:39.269 --> 03:21:39.279 align:start position:0%

03:21:53.110 --> 03:21:53.120 align:start position:0%
do not support this bill um
 
03:21:55.110 --> 03:21:55.120 align:start position:0%
i believe that that we have some issues
 
03:21:57.910 --> 03:21:57.920 align:start position:0%
within our town that um
 
03:21:59.910 --> 03:21:59.920 align:start position:0%
need to be
 
03:22:01.990 --> 03:22:02.000 align:start position:0%
dealt with locally not dealt with at
 
03:22:05.429 --> 03:22:05.439 align:start position:0%
your level and um
 
03:22:07.910 --> 03:22:07.920 align:start position:0%
i think that this bill
 
03:22:07.920 --> 03:22:09.349 align:start position:0%
i think that this bill
and

03:22:09.349 --> 03:22:09.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:22:12.950 --> 03:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
um senator guida have worked very hard
 
03:22:15.750 --> 03:22:15.760 align:start position:0%
to divide our community
 
03:22:17.510 --> 03:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
and the only way that we're going to
 
03:22:19.750 --> 03:22:19.760 align:start position:0%
correct this is to bring the parties
 
03:22:19.760 --> 03:22:21.429 align:start position:0%
correct this is to bring the parties
together

03:22:21.429 --> 03:22:21.439 align:start position:0%
together
 
03:22:23.750 --> 03:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
that this affects
 
03:22:23.760 --> 03:22:24.630 align:start position:0%
that this affects
and

03:22:24.630 --> 03:22:24.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:22:26.309 --> 03:22:26.319 align:start position:0%
let us decide how to fix our own
 
03:22:35.349 --> 03:22:35.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:38.710 --> 03:22:38.720 align:start position:0%
the woodsville taxpayer
 
03:22:40.870 --> 03:22:40.880 align:start position:0%

hampshire information pertaining to
 
03:24:16.070 --> 03:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
senate bill 26 relative to the roads of
 
03:24:17.750 --> 03:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
the whistle fire district
 
03:24:20.389 --> 03:24:20.399 align:start position:0%
senate bill 26 as amended in the senate
 
03:24:22.070 --> 03:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
grants the woodsville fire district the
 
03:24:24.070 --> 03:24:24.080 align:start position:0%
option of operating its own highway
 
03:24:25.750 --> 03:24:25.760 align:start position:0%
department and maintaining its eight
 
03:24:28.150 --> 03:24:28.160 align:start position:0%
miles of roads at the district's own
 
03:24:28.160 --> 03:24:29.510 align:start position:0%
miles of roads at the district's own
expense

03:24:29.510 --> 03:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
expense
 
03:24:31.349 --> 03:24:31.359 align:start position:0%
the woodsville fire district like other
 
03:24:31.359 --> 03:24:32.630 align:start position:0%
the woodsville fire district like other
precincts

03:24:32.630 --> 03:24:32.640 align:start position:0%
precincts
 
03:24:34.950 --> 03:24:34.960 align:start position:0%
is a separate and distinct municipality
 
03:24:36.309 --> 03:24:36.319 align:start position:0%
from the town
 
03:24:38.150 --> 03:24:38.160 align:start position:0%
the entire purpose of forming a precinct
 
03:24:39.670 --> 03:24:39.680 align:start position:0%
or village district is to allow a
 
03:24:41.349 --> 03:24:41.359 align:start position:0%
smaller group of residents to manage
 
03:24:44.229 --> 03:24:44.239 align:start position:0%
their own needs by removing some power
 
03:24:46.229 --> 03:24:46.239 align:start position:0%
from the existing municipality in this
 
03:24:48.070 --> 03:24:48.080 align:start position:0%
case the town
 
03:24:49.750 --> 03:24:49.760 align:start position:0%
woodsville has a separate legislative
 
03:24:49.760 --> 03:24:50.630 align:start position:0%
woodsville has a separate legislative
body

03:24:50.630 --> 03:24:50.640 align:start position:0%
body
 
03:24:52.389 --> 03:24:52.399 align:start position:0%
and a separate governing body through
 
03:24:55.670 --> 03:24:55.680 align:start position:0%
which it exercises his their power
 
03:24:57.910 --> 03:24:57.920 align:start position:0%
however with that power comes
 
03:24:57.920 --> 03:24:59.510 align:start position:0%
however with that power comes
responsibility

03:24:59.510 --> 03:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
03:25:01.670 --> 03:25:01.680 align:start position:0%
specifically precincts are responsible
 
03:25:03.590 --> 03:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
for funding their own activities
 
03:25:05.429 --> 03:25:05.439 align:start position:0%
woodsville has the authority to raise
 
03:25:07.750 --> 03:25:07.760 align:start position:0%
and appropriate its own funds from its
 
03:25:09.990 --> 03:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
own residents woodsville is free to
 
03:25:13.030 --> 03:25:13.040 align:start position:0%
raise appropriate and expend as much or
 
03:25:15.750 --> 03:25:15.760 align:start position:0%
as little money as its voters and
 
03:25:17.990 --> 03:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
governing body feel is appropriate the
 
03:25:21.110 --> 03:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
town has no control over that
 
03:25:23.510 --> 03:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
the woodsville fire district should not
 
03:25:26.070 --> 03:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
have its cake and eat it too
 
03:25:27.990 --> 03:25:28.000 align:start position:0%
the woodsville because woodsville wants
 
03:25:29.750 --> 03:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
the independent power to operate its own
 
03:25:31.190 --> 03:25:31.200 align:start position:0%
highway department without
 
03:25:33.750 --> 03:25:33.760 align:start position:0%
accountability to the town voters yet it
 
03:25:35.990 --> 03:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
wants the town taxpayers the majority of
 
03:25:38.309 --> 03:25:38.319 align:start position:0%
whom do not live in woodsville
 
03:25:39.910 --> 03:25:39.920 align:start position:0%
to fund it
 
03:25:41.269 --> 03:25:41.279 align:start position:0%
even though the town's highway
 
03:25:43.030 --> 03:25:43.040 align:start position:0%
department is equipped with a cape and
 
03:25:45.190 --> 03:25:45.200 align:start position:0%
capable of maintaining the precinct's
 
03:25:47.670 --> 03:25:47.680 align:start position:0%
eight miles of roads
 
03:25:50.150 --> 03:25:50.160 align:start position:0%
put it simply to put it simply having
 
03:25:51.910 --> 03:25:51.920 align:start position:0%
the town fund woodsville's highway
 
03:25:53.910 --> 03:25:53.920 align:start position:0%
department operations places the burden
 
03:25:55.590 --> 03:25:55.600 align:start position:0%
of funding the municipal operation of
 
03:25:57.990 --> 03:25:58.000 align:start position:0%
one municipality woodsville on the
 
03:26:00.070 --> 03:26:00.080 align:start position:0%
taxpayers of another municipality the
 
03:26:03.349 --> 03:26:03.359 align:start position:0%
town while simultaneously depriving the
 
03:26:05.910 --> 03:26:05.920 align:start position:0%
town authority and accountability over
 
03:26:08.229 --> 03:26:08.239 align:start position:0%
the expenditure of those funds this is
 
03:26:10.710 --> 03:26:10.720 align:start position:0%
wholly inappropriate and runs afoul of
 
03:26:12.870 --> 03:26:12.880 align:start position:0%
basic principles of municipal governance
 
03:26:15.590 --> 03:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
and expenditures
 
03:26:17.590 --> 03:26:17.600 align:start position:0%
this is even more troublesome given the
 
03:26:19.110 --> 03:26:19.120 align:start position:0%
fact that the woodville fire district's
 
03:26:21.429 --> 03:26:21.439 align:start position:0%
highway department only serves the area
 
03:26:23.510 --> 03:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
within its own precinct boundaries three
 
03:26:26.550 --> 03:26:26.560 align:start position:0%
square miles and provides no benefit to
 
03:26:28.790 --> 03:26:28.800 align:start position:0%
the lard the town at large
 
03:26:30.150 --> 03:26:30.160 align:start position:0%
the town of haverhill should not be
 
03:26:31.990 --> 03:26:32.000 align:start position:0%
required to fund woodsville's own
 
03:26:34.389 --> 03:26:34.399 align:start position:0%
internal operations which solely benefit
 
03:26:34.399 --> 03:26:36.469 align:start position:0%
internal operations which solely benefit
woodsville

03:26:36.469 --> 03:26:36.479 align:start position:0%
woodsville
 
03:26:38.710 --> 03:26:38.720 align:start position:0%
highres state due to its importance that
 
03:26:40.950 --> 03:26:40.960 align:start position:0%
the town of haverhill is willing and
 
03:26:43.510 --> 03:26:43.520 align:start position:0%
able to maintain the roads within the
 
03:26:45.429 --> 03:26:45.439 align:start position:0%
woodsville fire district through the
 
03:26:47.349 --> 03:26:47.359 align:start position:0%
town's highway department who already
 
03:26:50.550 --> 03:26:50.560 align:start position:0%
maintain 72 miles of roads
 
03:26:52.389 --> 03:26:52.399 align:start position:0%
the town's highway department already
 
03:26:55.030 --> 03:26:55.040 align:start position:0%
maintains these roads throughout
 
03:26:57.030 --> 03:26:57.040 align:start position:0%
haverhill and is prepared to take on
 
03:26:58.469 --> 03:26:58.479 align:start position:0%
eight miles of roads within the
 
03:27:00.469 --> 03:27:00.479 align:start position:0%
woodsville fire district
 
03:27:02.309 --> 03:27:02.319 align:start position:0%
the town is ready willing and able to
 
03:27:03.990 --> 03:27:04.000 align:start position:0%
take on road maintenance for all of its
 
03:27:06.389 --> 03:27:06.399 align:start position:0%
residents including those in woodsville
 
03:27:09.030 --> 03:27:09.040 align:start position:0%
however so long as woodsville desires to
 
03:27:11.429 --> 03:27:11.439 align:start position:0%
retain its own independent power to
 
03:27:12.950 --> 03:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
operate a highway department within its
 
03:27:14.710 --> 03:27:14.720 align:start position:0%
borders it should bear the
 
03:27:17.670 --> 03:27:17.680 align:start position:0%
responsibility to fund the same
 
03:27:19.349 --> 03:27:19.359 align:start position:0%

right now
 
03:27:44.560 --> 03:27:45.910 align:start position:0%
right now
the

03:27:45.910 --> 03:27:45.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:27:45.920 --> 03:27:46.710 align:start position:0%
the
the

03:27:46.710 --> 03:27:46.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:27:48.550 --> 03:27:48.560 align:start position:0%
woodsville district maintains those
 
03:27:50.229 --> 03:27:50.239 align:start position:0%
eight miles of roads themselves is that
 
03:27:50.239 --> 03:27:51.030 align:start position:0%
eight miles of roads themselves is that
correct

03:27:51.030 --> 03:27:51.040 align:start position:0%
correct
 
03:27:52.790 --> 03:27:52.800 align:start position:0%
they do they have their own highway
 
03:27:54.950 --> 03:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
department and they maintain their eight
 
03:27:57.349 --> 03:27:57.359 align:start position:0%
miles of roads yes right and so and the
 
03:27:58.630 --> 03:27:58.640 align:start position:0%
money for that
 
03:28:00.950 --> 03:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
comes from what the taxes that are
 
03:28:03.110 --> 03:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
raised town wide in the
 
03:28:05.190 --> 03:28:05.200 align:start position:0%
formula gives them
 
03:28:07.910 --> 03:28:07.920 align:start position:0%
roughly 25 based upon assessed value is
 
03:28:09.670 --> 03:28:09.680 align:start position:0%
that is that correct
 
03:28:12.469 --> 03:28:12.479 align:start position:0%
um that's part of it yes i'm sorry i
 
03:28:14.790 --> 03:28:14.800 align:start position:0%
should be asking for a follow-up
 
03:28:14.800 --> 03:28:16.870 align:start position:0%
should be asking for a follow-up
um

03:28:16.870 --> 03:28:16.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:28:16.880 --> 03:28:17.750 align:start position:0%
um
so

03:28:17.750 --> 03:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:28:20.150 --> 03:28:20.160 align:start position:0%
if if this occurs
 
03:28:20.160 --> 03:28:22.229 align:start position:0%
if if this occurs
that

03:28:22.229 --> 03:28:22.239 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:28:24.150 --> 03:28:24.160 align:start position:0%
if we take away that
 
03:28:24.160 --> 03:28:26.070 align:start position:0%
if we take away that
responsibility

03:28:26.070 --> 03:28:26.080 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
03:28:27.750 --> 03:28:27.760 align:start position:0%
you would still be raising funds town
 
03:28:31.110 --> 03:28:31.120 align:start position:0%
wide and then they would be distributed
 
03:28:32.870 --> 03:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
between the woodsville district and
 
03:28:34.870 --> 03:28:34.880 align:start position:0%
everybody else according to however the
 
03:28:37.429 --> 03:28:37.439 align:start position:0%
town meeting
 
03:28:40.630 --> 03:28:40.640 align:start position:0%
uh approved of the town budget is that
 
03:28:43.110 --> 03:28:43.120 align:start position:0%
is that what's being proposed here
 
03:28:45.510 --> 03:28:45.520 align:start position:0%
with senate bill 26 what it does is it
 
03:28:47.910 --> 03:28:47.920 align:start position:0%
takes away the requirement of the town
 
03:28:49.510 --> 03:28:49.520 align:start position:0%
to fund the woodsville highway
 
03:28:49.520 --> 03:28:50.790 align:start position:0%
to fund the woodsville highway
department

03:28:50.790 --> 03:28:50.800 align:start position:0%
department
 
03:28:53.510 --> 03:28:53.520 align:start position:0%
um making woodsville responsible for its
 
03:28:56.389 --> 03:28:56.399 align:start position:0%
own operations that they choose to have
 
03:28:58.630 --> 03:28:58.640 align:start position:0%
um for within their their precinct and
 
03:29:00.710 --> 03:29:00.720 align:start position:0%
they have full authority over that
 
03:29:05.510 --> 03:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
um and then it leaves it up to the town
 
03:29:08.389 --> 03:29:08.399 align:start position:0%
the at the uh town level to decide
 
03:29:09.830 --> 03:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
whether there are services that
 
03:29:11.990 --> 03:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
woodsville's providing that the town
 
03:29:14.870 --> 03:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:17.349 --> 03:29:17.359 align:start position:0%
if i have a question i still don't
 
03:29:19.269 --> 03:29:19.279 align:start position:0%
get any point here
 
03:29:19.279 --> 03:29:20.630 align:start position:0%
get any point here
that

03:29:20.630 --> 03:29:20.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:29:22.790 --> 03:29:22.800 align:start position:0%
the town at the town raises a hundred
 
03:29:25.349 --> 03:29:25.359 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars for highway maintenance
 
03:29:27.349 --> 03:29:27.359 align:start position:0%
according to the current
 
03:29:29.349 --> 03:29:29.359 align:start position:0%
uh situation they pay
 
03:29:31.030 --> 03:29:31.040 align:start position:0%
a proportional share to woodsville
 
03:29:33.190 --> 03:29:33.200 align:start position:0%
approximately 25 percent
 
03:29:35.349 --> 03:29:35.359 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's it's up to almost 30
 
03:29:38.550 --> 03:29:38.560 align:start position:0%
percent so it fluctuates so so that that
 
03:29:40.229 --> 03:29:40.239 align:start position:0%
reflects the amount of money that's
 
03:29:41.349 --> 03:29:41.359 align:start position:0%
actually raised from that district
 
03:29:43.670 --> 03:29:43.680 align:start position:0%
because it's based upon
 
03:29:46.469 --> 03:29:46.479 align:start position:0%
a proportion of the uh pro-rata share of
 
03:29:48.630 --> 03:29:48.640 align:start position:0%
the assessed value
 
03:29:50.150 --> 03:29:50.160 align:start position:0%
so essentially just giving them back
 
03:29:53.510 --> 03:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
money that's raised from that district
 
03:29:55.670 --> 03:29:55.680 align:start position:0%
for highway maintenance
 
03:29:58.790 --> 03:29:58.800 align:start position:0%
so so when you think about um
 
03:30:00.309 --> 03:30:00.319 align:start position:0%
the two different layers of government
 
03:30:01.830 --> 03:30:01.840 align:start position:0%
so you have the town and then you have
 
03:30:03.349 --> 03:30:03.359 align:start position:0%
the precinct
 
03:30:05.670 --> 03:30:05.680 align:start position:0%
there are similar activities where
 
03:30:07.990 --> 03:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
the town is providing
 
03:30:09.990 --> 03:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
for example police services to
 
03:30:12.790 --> 03:30:12.800 align:start position:0%
woodsville so the entire town raises
 
03:30:14.870 --> 03:30:14.880 align:start position:0%
about a million dollars a year to have a
 
03:30:17.190 --> 03:30:17.200 align:start position:0%
police department and to and to operate
 
03:30:20.070 --> 03:30:20.080 align:start position:0%
that police department however about 70
 
03:30:22.469 --> 03:30:22.479 align:start position:0%
between 70 and 80 percent of our police
 
03:30:24.790 --> 03:30:24.800 align:start position:0%
force forces throughout the year and our
 
03:30:26.790 --> 03:30:26.800 align:start position:0%
dollars are spent in the woodsville
 
03:30:26.800 --> 03:30:28.070 align:start position:0%
dollars are spent in the woodsville
precinct

03:30:28.070 --> 03:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
precinct
 
03:30:30.790 --> 03:30:30.800 align:start position:0%
of course what do you think about equity
 
03:30:30.800 --> 03:30:31.590 align:start position:0%
of course what do you think about equity
um

03:30:31.590 --> 03:30:31.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:30:34.229 --> 03:30:34.239 align:start position:0%
certainly um haverhill at large is
 
03:30:37.030 --> 03:30:37.040 align:start position:0%
paying the the largest portion of that
 
03:30:38.710 --> 03:30:38.720 align:start position:0%
but the services are being provided in
 
03:30:39.990 --> 03:30:40.000 align:start position:0%
woodsville so
 
03:30:42.070 --> 03:30:42.080 align:start position:0%
you have to kind of separate the town
 
03:30:43.670 --> 03:30:43.680 align:start position:0%
from the precinct the precinct is a
 
03:30:46.469 --> 03:30:46.479 align:start position:0%
municipal entity it gets to choose
 
03:30:47.750 --> 03:30:47.760 align:start position:0%
in this case to have a highway
 
03:30:47.760 --> 03:30:49.190 align:start position:0%
in this case to have a highway
department

03:30:49.190 --> 03:30:49.200 align:start position:0%
department
 
03:30:51.190 --> 03:30:51.200 align:start position:0%
and and no one else has control over
 
03:30:53.510 --> 03:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
that but the individuals in woodsville
 
03:30:55.030 --> 03:30:55.040 align:start position:0%
however the rest of the town is
 
03:30:56.550 --> 03:30:56.560 align:start position:0%
responsible for
 
03:30:59.990 --> 03:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
for assisting with paying for that
 
03:31:02.389 --> 03:31:02.399 align:start position:0%
and even though we already operate a
 
03:31:04.550 --> 03:31:04.560 align:start position:0%
highway department
 
03:31:06.790 --> 03:31:06.800 align:start position:0%
and so that the difference is okay
 
03:31:09.269 --> 03:31:09.279 align:start position:0%
that um the town's highway department
 
03:31:12.389 --> 03:31:12.399 align:start position:0%
budget is about 780 000 woodsville's
 
03:31:14.469 --> 03:31:14.479 align:start position:0%
department highway department budget has
 
03:31:16.550 --> 03:31:16.560 align:start position:0%
gone up to almost half a million
 
03:31:18.389 --> 03:31:18.399 align:start position:0%
so that's
 
03:31:20.469 --> 03:31:20.479 align:start position:0%
that's for eight miles of road
 
03:31:22.790 --> 03:31:22.800 align:start position:0%
roads where we have 72 miles of roads
 
03:31:25.910 --> 03:31:25.920 align:start position:0%
that we cover for 780 000. so even
 
03:31:25.920 --> 03:31:26.710 align:start position:0%
that we cover for 780 000. so even
though

03:31:26.710 --> 03:31:26.720 align:start position:0%
though
 
03:31:29.510 --> 03:31:29.520 align:start position:0%
it sounds like you're you're you're
 
03:31:31.750 --> 03:31:31.760 align:start position:0%
going apples to apples with with giving
 
03:31:34.150 --> 03:31:34.160 align:start position:0%
them back every penny that they raise
 
03:31:42.070 --> 03:31:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:44.229 --> 03:31:44.239 align:start position:0%
it's the same with welfare as well so
 
03:31:46.870 --> 03:31:46.880 align:start position:0%
everyone in town pays the welfare budget
 
03:31:50.870 --> 03:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
um but the same the same um ratio goes
 
03:31:52.389 --> 03:31:52.399 align:start position:0%
to woodsville most of our welfare
 
03:31:54.150 --> 03:31:54.160 align:start position:0%
dollars are spent in woodsville but
 
03:31:55.910 --> 03:31:55.920 align:start position:0%
everybody pays for that because it's a
 
03:31:55.920 --> 03:32:01.830 align:start position:0%
everybody pays for that because it's a
town

03:32:01.830 --> 03:32:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:02.710 --> 03:32:02.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:32:05.429 --> 03:32:05.439 align:start position:0%
mr chairman and it's called link
 
03:32:07.510 --> 03:32:07.520 align:start position:0%
question i have is what percentage of
 
03:32:11.750 --> 03:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
the town's base tax rate is raised from
 
03:32:13.750 --> 03:32:13.760 align:start position:0%
the fire district area
 
03:32:15.190 --> 03:32:15.200 align:start position:0%
isn't that the majority of the
 
03:32:15.200 --> 03:32:16.389 align:start position:0%
isn't that the majority of the
commercial

03:32:16.389 --> 03:32:16.399 align:start position:0%
commercial
 
03:32:19.190 --> 03:32:19.200 align:start position:0%
property in the town of april
 
03:32:21.590 --> 03:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
yes so there's about 20 percent of the
 
03:32:24.309 --> 03:32:24.319 align:start position:0%
tax base in in the woodsville precinct
 
03:32:26.550 --> 03:32:26.560 align:start position:0%
because of the commercial buildings the
 
03:32:29.750 --> 03:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
commercial enterprises there
 
03:32:29.760 --> 03:32:31.910 align:start position:0%

03:35:08.389 --> 03:35:08.399 align:start position:0%
into one line item
 
03:35:10.070 --> 03:35:10.080 align:start position:0%
as a result of this this reduced the
 
03:35:11.830 --> 03:35:11.840 align:start position:0%
total highway budget
 
03:35:14.150 --> 03:35:14.160 align:start position:0%
by about 10 percent
 
03:35:15.910 --> 03:35:15.920 align:start position:0%
um and this
 
03:35:18.469 --> 03:35:18.479 align:start position:0%
budget figure is what's used is in part
 
03:35:19.750 --> 03:35:19.760 align:start position:0%
of the woodsville highway funding
 
03:35:19.760 --> 03:35:21.590 align:start position:0%
of the woodsville highway funding
calculation

03:35:21.590 --> 03:35:21.600 align:start position:0%
calculation
 
03:35:23.190 --> 03:35:23.200 align:start position:0%
because of this change the precinct
 
03:35:24.630 --> 03:35:24.640 align:start position:0%
commissioners felt the town was no
 
03:35:26.389 --> 03:35:26.399 align:start position:0%
longer providing them with adequate
 
03:35:26.399 --> 03:35:29.429 align:start position:0%
longer providing them with adequate
funding

03:35:29.429 --> 03:35:29.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:31.110 --> 03:35:31.120 align:start position:0%
the town manager that hired me retired
 
03:35:33.750 --> 03:35:33.760 align:start position:0%
in november of 2018 and an interim town
 
03:35:35.349 --> 03:35:35.359 align:start position:0%
manager came in
 
03:35:38.070 --> 03:35:38.080 align:start position:0%
to prepare the 2019 budget the
 
03:35:39.349 --> 03:35:39.359 align:start position:0%
woodsville commissioners then went to
 
03:35:41.349 --> 03:35:41.359 align:start position:0%
him to express their concerns about the
 
03:35:42.870 --> 03:35:42.880 align:start position:0%
funding of the woodsville highway
 
03:35:42.880 --> 03:35:43.910 align:start position:0%
funding of the woodsville highway
department

03:35:43.910 --> 03:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
department
 
03:35:45.910 --> 03:35:45.920 align:start position:0%
and i was redirected to calculate the
 
03:35:47.670 --> 03:35:47.680 align:start position:0%
woodswell highway funding to include the
 
03:35:49.750 --> 03:35:49.760 align:start position:0%
health insurance benefits
 
03:35:51.670 --> 03:35:51.680 align:start position:0%
although i disagreed i did recalculate
 
03:35:53.830 --> 03:35:53.840 align:start position:0%
the funding and included the revised
 
03:35:57.110 --> 03:35:57.120 align:start position:0%
figure in the 2019 budget
 
03:35:58.950 --> 03:35:58.960 align:start position:0%
the woodsville commissioners still
 
03:36:00.389 --> 03:36:00.399 align:start position:0%
continued to question the highway
 
03:36:02.229 --> 03:36:02.239 align:start position:0%
funding calculation and brought up their
 
03:36:04.389 --> 03:36:04.399 align:start position:0%
concerns with the new town manager who
 
03:36:07.910 --> 03:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
was hired in april 2019.
 
03:36:09.670 --> 03:36:09.680 align:start position:0%
the new town manager requested i provide
 
03:36:11.349 --> 03:36:11.359 align:start position:0%
her with the information regarding the
 
03:36:13.990 --> 03:36:14.000 align:start position:0%
woodsville highway funding which i did
 
03:36:15.750 --> 03:36:15.760 align:start position:0%
um i gave her the spreadsheet that i
 
03:36:17.349 --> 03:36:17.359 align:start position:0%
used as well as the memorandum of
 
03:36:19.910 --> 03:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
understanding that was used that the
 
03:36:23.190 --> 03:36:23.200 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet was created based on
 
03:36:24.710 --> 03:36:24.720 align:start position:0%
we both her and i reviewed the
 
03:36:26.710 --> 03:36:26.720 align:start position:0%
documentations and agreed that the
 
03:36:28.710 --> 03:36:28.720 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet being used in calculating
 
03:36:30.870 --> 03:36:30.880 align:start position:0%
the highway funding did not accurately
 
03:36:32.830 --> 03:36:32.840 align:start position:0%
correct capture the memorandum of
 
03:36:35.190 --> 03:36:35.200 align:start position:0%
understanding so i was then asked to
 
03:36:37.269 --> 03:36:37.279 align:start position:0%
revise the spreadsheets to more
 
03:36:39.190 --> 03:36:39.200 align:start position:0%
accurately reflect reflect the
 
03:36:41.670 --> 03:36:41.680 align:start position:0%
memorandum of understanding
 
03:36:43.670 --> 03:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
after the spreadsheet was revised we
 
03:36:45.349 --> 03:36:45.359 align:start position:0%
would hold a meeting with the selectmen
 
03:36:47.110 --> 03:36:47.120 align:start position:0%
and the woodsville commissioners to
 
03:36:49.030 --> 03:36:49.040 align:start position:0%
discuss the revisions and work towards
 
03:36:50.630 --> 03:36:50.640 align:start position:0%
reaching an agreement about the funding
 
03:36:50.640 --> 03:36:52.389 align:start position:0%
reaching an agreement about the funding
formula

03:36:52.389 --> 03:36:52.399 align:start position:0%
formula
 
03:36:54.070 --> 03:36:54.080 align:start position:0%
my revisions were meant to provide a
 
03:36:55.510 --> 03:36:55.520 align:start position:0%
starting point for the selectmen and
 
03:36:57.429 --> 03:36:57.439 align:start position:0%
commissioners to work together to come
 
03:36:59.750 --> 03:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
up with a funding formula which more
 
03:37:01.670 --> 03:37:01.680 align:start position:0%
accurately reflected the memorandum of
 
03:37:01.680 --> 03:37:03.190 align:start position:0%
accurately reflected the memorandum of
understanding

03:37:03.190 --> 03:37:03.200 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
03:37:04.950 --> 03:37:04.960 align:start position:0%
the commissioners were unwilling to work
 
03:37:08.309 --> 03:37:08.319 align:start position:0%
with this leftboard towards a solution
 
03:37:09.670 --> 03:37:09.680 align:start position:0%
in an attempt to reinforce the
 
03:37:12.229 --> 03:37:12.239 align:start position:0%
memorandum of understanding as law
 
03:37:15.429 --> 03:37:15.439 align:start position:0%
sb-75 was introduced in 2009 and was
 
03:37:17.269 --> 03:37:17.279 align:start position:0%
passed as amended
 
03:37:20.070 --> 03:37:20.080 align:start position:0%
however the 2009 change to the law is
 
03:37:22.389 --> 03:37:22.399 align:start position:0%
unclear as to what the formula actually
 
03:37:22.399 --> 03:37:23.750 align:start position:0%
unclear as to what the formula actually
is

03:37:23.750 --> 03:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:37:25.910 --> 03:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
therefore the town has had to refer back
 
03:37:28.550 --> 03:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
to the 2008 memorandum of understanding
 
03:37:31.590 --> 03:37:31.600 align:start position:0%
for its calculations
 
03:37:33.349 --> 03:37:33.359 align:start position:0%
over the years since the introduction of
 
03:37:35.349 --> 03:37:35.359 align:start position:0%
the memorandum of understanding
 
03:37:36.950 --> 03:37:36.960 align:start position:0%
the town has typically provided the
 
03:37:38.550 --> 03:37:38.560 align:start position:0%
precinct of woodsville funding that
 
03:37:40.790 --> 03:37:40.800 align:start position:0%
equates to 30 to 50 percent of what the
 
03:37:42.830 --> 03:37:42.840 align:start position:0%
town budgets for our highway
 
03:37:46.150 --> 03:37:46.160 align:start position:0%
department for example in 2018 the
 
03:37:47.910 --> 03:37:47.920 align:start position:0%
town's highway budget was seven hundred
 
03:37:49.750 --> 03:37:49.760 align:start position:0%
and sixty nine thousand five hundred two
 
03:37:49.760 --> 03:37:50.790 align:start position:0%
and sixty nine thousand five hundred two
dollars

03:37:50.790 --> 03:37:50.800 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
03:37:52.309 --> 03:37:52.319 align:start position:0%
and the town provided the woodsville
 
03:37:54.070 --> 03:37:54.080 align:start position:0%
precinct with four hundred and twenty
 
03:37:55.830 --> 03:37:55.840 align:start position:0%
nine thousand two hundred and three
 
03:37:57.349 --> 03:37:57.359 align:start position:0%
dollars in funding for their highway
 
03:37:57.359 --> 03:37:58.630 align:start position:0%
dollars in funding for their highway
department

03:37:58.630 --> 03:37:58.640 align:start position:0%
department
 
03:38:01.670 --> 03:38:01.680 align:start position:0%
that funding equates to 55.77
 
03:38:04.550 --> 03:38:04.560 align:start position:0%
of what the town spent on their roads
 
03:38:06.790 --> 03:38:06.800 align:start position:0%
to further put this into perspective the
 
03:38:10.150 --> 03:38:10.160 align:start position:0%
town spent that 796 000
 
03:38:12.630 --> 03:38:12.640 align:start position:0%
to maintain 72 miles of road within our
 
03:38:12.640 --> 03:38:14.070 align:start position:0%
to maintain 72 miles of road within our
jurisdiction

03:38:14.070 --> 03:38:14.080 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction
 
03:38:16.070 --> 03:38:16.080 align:start position:0%
while the town provided the precinct of
 
03:38:18.950 --> 03:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
woodsville with 429 thousand dollars to
 
03:38:22.229 --> 03:38:22.239 align:start position:0%
care for the their eight miles of road
 
03:38:23.830 --> 03:38:23.840 align:start position:0%
that's ten thousand six hundred and
 
03:38:25.429 --> 03:38:25.439 align:start position:0%
eighty seven dollars being spent per
 
03:38:30.150 --> 03:38:30.160 align:start position:0%
mile by the town in comparison to 53 650
 
03:38:33.670 --> 03:38:33.680 align:start position:0%
per mile being spent by the precinct
 
03:38:35.670 --> 03:38:35.680 align:start position:0%
in 2020 when the revisions were made to
 
03:38:37.590 --> 03:38:37.600 align:start position:0%
the formula the precinct of woodsville
 
03:38:39.750 --> 03:38:39.760 align:start position:0%
received about 115
 
03:38:41.189 --> 03:38:41.199 align:start position:0%
hundred and eighty two dollars from the
 
03:38:41.199 --> 03:38:42.229 align:start position:0%
hundred and eighty two dollars from the
town

03:38:42.229 --> 03:38:42.239 align:start position:0%
town
 
03:38:44.309 --> 03:38:44.319 align:start position:0%
which equated to sixteen point six eight
 
03:38:47.189 --> 03:38:47.199 align:start position:0%
percent of the town's highway budget
 
03:38:49.030 --> 03:38:49.040 align:start position:0%
that reduced their amount spent per mile
 
03:38:50.790 --> 03:38:50.800 align:start position:0%
to fourteen thousand four hundred and
 
03:38:52.630 --> 03:38:52.640 align:start position:0%
ninety seven dollars which is more in
 
03:38:54.150 --> 03:38:54.160 align:start position:0%
line with what the town spends
 
03:38:57.110 --> 03:38:57.120 align:start position:0%
maintaining our roads
 
03:38:59.189 --> 03:38:59.199 align:start position:0%
to me it seems financially irresponsible
 
03:39:00.870 --> 03:39:00.880 align:start position:0%
for the town to be providing these large
 
03:39:03.349 --> 03:39:03.359 align:start position:0%
sums of money to maintain through their
 
03:39:05.750 --> 03:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
three square miles
 
03:39:07.910 --> 03:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
of roads located within the 52 square
 
03:39:10.150 --> 03:39:10.160 align:start position:0%
miles of the town
 
03:39:11.910 --> 03:39:11.920 align:start position:0%
in addition windsville property owners
 
03:39:13.349 --> 03:39:13.359 align:start position:0%
are property owners of the town of
 
03:39:15.030 --> 03:39:15.040 align:start position:0%
hayward and therefore just as
 
03:39:16.790 --> 03:39:16.800 align:start position:0%
responsible to pay for the maintenance
 
03:39:18.710 --> 03:39:18.720 align:start position:0%
of the town roads as a property owner
 
03:39:21.429 --> 03:39:21.439 align:start position:0%
jose lives in haverhill corner
 
03:39:23.110 --> 03:39:23.120 align:start position:0%
the town has its own highway department
 
03:39:24.389 --> 03:39:24.399 align:start position:0%
that is completely capable of
 
03:39:26.070 --> 03:39:26.080 align:start position:0%
maintaining the roads within the
 
03:39:28.469 --> 03:39:28.479 align:start position:0%
boundaries of the precinct of woodsville
 
03:39:29.990 --> 03:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
however the precinct of wizville made
 
03:39:31.750 --> 03:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
the choice many years ago to ask the
 
03:39:33.269 --> 03:39:33.279 align:start position:0%
state for permission to create their own
 
03:39:34.950 --> 03:39:34.960 align:start position:0%
highway department and they were granted
 
03:39:36.790 --> 03:39:36.800 align:start position:0%
that permission
 
03:39:38.630 --> 03:39:38.640 align:start position:0%
therefore it is the responsibility of
 
03:39:40.150 --> 03:39:40.160 align:start position:0%
the property owners within the precinct
 
03:39:41.670 --> 03:39:41.680 align:start position:0%
of woods hill to fund their precinct
 
03:39:43.429 --> 03:39:43.439 align:start position:0%
highway department
 
03:39:45.750 --> 03:39:45.760 align:start position:0%
and this is what sv 26 is attempting to
 
03:39:45.760 --> 03:39:46.870 align:start position:0%
and this is what sv 26 is attempting to
do

03:39:46.870 --> 03:39:46.880 align:start position:0%
do
 
03:39:48.550 --> 03:39:48.560 align:start position:0%
i ask you to
 
03:39:51.189 --> 03:39:51.199 align:start position:0%
please vote for sb 26 as amended and
 
03:39:53.269 --> 03:39:53.279 align:start position:0%
give the town back local control of its
 
03:39:56.309 --> 03:39:56.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:58.630 --> 03:39:58.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:40:00.710 --> 03:40:00.720 align:start position:0%
i do have one request

if what you just said
 
03:40:04.389 --> 03:40:04.399 align:start position:0%
you have written
 
03:40:06.550 --> 03:40:06.560 align:start position:0%
if you've given us a lot of facts
 
03:40:06.560 --> 03:40:07.750 align:start position:0%
if you've given us a lot of facts
figures

03:40:07.750 --> 03:40:07.760 align:start position:0%
figures
 
03:40:09.030 --> 03:40:09.040 align:start position:0%
and and
 
03:40:10.150 --> 03:40:10.160 align:start position:0%
the rest
 
03:40:10.160 --> 03:40:11.349 align:start position:0%
the rest
um

03:40:11.349 --> 03:40:11.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:40:13.830 --> 03:40:13.840 align:start position:0%
if you could email that to the committee
 
03:40:16.830 --> 03:40:16.840 align:start position:0%
i would be truly appreciative
 
03:40:19.590 --> 03:40:19.600 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you yeah

this future from members of smith
 
03:40:30.389 --> 03:40:30.399 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you
 
03:40:32.389 --> 03:40:32.399 align:start position:0%

um i just want to reiterate a couple of
 
03:42:27.349 --> 03:42:27.359 align:start position:0%
things um that
 
03:42:30.229 --> 03:42:30.239 align:start position:0%
senator guida had spoken about
 
03:42:30.239 --> 03:42:31.349 align:start position:0%
senator guida had spoken about
we

03:42:31.349 --> 03:42:31.359 align:start position:0%
we
 
03:42:33.830 --> 03:42:33.840 align:start position:0%
they talked about local control and we
 
03:42:35.750 --> 03:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
had i was part of that original
 
03:42:35.760 --> 03:42:37.269 align:start position:0%
had i was part of that original
negotiation

03:42:37.269 --> 03:42:37.279 align:start position:0%
negotiation
 
03:42:39.830 --> 03:42:39.840 align:start position:0%
back about two years ago and i said we
 
03:42:41.750 --> 03:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
had approximately three maybe more
 
03:42:44.150 --> 03:42:44.160 align:start position:0%
meetings that were kindly chaired by
 
03:42:46.070 --> 03:42:46.080 align:start position:0%
senator gaida and representative rick
 
03:42:46.080 --> 03:42:46.950 align:start position:0%
senator gaida and representative rick
ladd

03:42:46.950 --> 03:42:46.960 align:start position:0%
ladd
 
03:42:49.110 --> 03:42:49.120 align:start position:0%
uh themselves they actually came down in
 
03:42:50.550 --> 03:42:50.560 align:start position:0%
this uh
 
03:42:52.389 --> 03:42:52.399 align:start position:0%
to attempt to um
 
03:42:55.429 --> 03:42:55.439 align:start position:0%
help these negotiations uh and they were
 
03:42:57.910 --> 03:42:57.920 align:start position:0%
completely fruitless we had
 
03:42:59.269 --> 03:42:59.279 align:start position:0%
we had no
 
03:43:02.070 --> 03:43:02.080 align:start position:0%
no um nothing came of those negotiations
 
03:43:04.630 --> 03:43:04.640 align:start position:0%
at all um what i'd like to say is that
 
03:43:08.070 --> 03:43:08.080 align:start position:0%
this is the antithesis of local control
 
03:43:10.790 --> 03:43:10.800 align:start position:0%
this arrangement as it stands now is the
 
03:43:12.550 --> 03:43:12.560 align:start position:0%
only one like it in the entire state of
 
03:43:14.550 --> 03:43:14.560 align:start position:0%
new hampshire where
 
03:43:16.630 --> 03:43:16.640 align:start position:0%
the state basically ties the town's
 
03:43:19.510 --> 03:43:19.520 align:start position:0%
hands and they dictate to us how our
 
03:43:22.070 --> 03:43:22.080 align:start position:0%
locally raised highway taxes are to be
 
03:43:22.080 --> 03:43:22.950 align:start position:0%
locally raised highway taxes are to be
spent

03:43:22.950 --> 03:43:22.960 align:start position:0%
spent
 
03:43:22.960 --> 03:43:24.229 align:start position:0%
spent
um

03:43:24.229 --> 03:43:24.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:43:26.630 --> 03:43:26.640 align:start position:0%
it just like i said woodsville is a
 
03:43:28.950 --> 03:43:28.960 align:start position:0%
separate and distinct municipality and
 
03:43:30.950 --> 03:43:30.960 align:start position:0%
under the laws in new hampshire
 
03:43:33.110 --> 03:43:33.120 align:start position:0%
they have the opportunity to choose what
 
03:43:34.950 --> 03:43:34.960 align:start position:0%
services they wish to provide for their
 
03:43:37.189 --> 03:43:37.199 align:start position:0%
own people so
 
03:43:39.429 --> 03:43:39.439 align:start position:0%
when uh in been part of those
 
03:43:41.429 --> 03:43:41.439 align:start position:0%
negotiations that we had one of the
 
03:43:42.950 --> 03:43:42.960 align:start position:0%
commissioners had stated well we just
 
03:43:45.670 --> 03:43:45.680 align:start position:0%
want our highway money back but problem
 
03:43:47.590 --> 03:43:47.600 align:start position:0%
with that thinking is when they want
 
03:43:49.269 --> 03:43:49.279 align:start position:0%
their highway money back
 
03:43:51.830 --> 03:43:51.840 align:start position:0%
to use on their roads only within their
 
03:43:53.910 --> 03:43:53.920 align:start position:0%
district they're not paying for the
 
03:43:57.030 --> 03:43:57.040 align:start position:0%
other 72 miles of road that
 
03:43:59.269 --> 03:43:59.279 align:start position:0%
all the residents of of the town of
 
03:44:00.630 --> 03:44:00.640 align:start position:0%
haverhill use
 
03:44:03.269 --> 03:44:03.279 align:start position:0%
um and like manager codling has stated
 
03:44:05.030 --> 03:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
you know almost 80 percent of our police
 
03:44:07.269 --> 03:44:07.279 align:start position:0%
resources are spent within that
 
03:44:09.590 --> 03:44:09.600 align:start position:0%
municipality there of woodsville but yet
 
03:44:11.910 --> 03:44:11.920 align:start position:0%
we don't partition out the police bill
 
03:44:14.469 --> 03:44:14.479 align:start position:0%
like that you know everybody takes equal
 
03:44:16.389 --> 03:44:16.399 align:start position:0%
share when you join a town
 
03:44:18.790 --> 03:44:18.800 align:start position:0%
you contribute a little bit and i think
 
03:44:21.030 --> 03:44:21.040 align:start position:0%
you receive a lot in return and that's
 
03:44:23.830 --> 03:44:23.840 align:start position:0%
the case here because going forward when
 
03:44:26.630 --> 03:44:26.640 align:start position:0%
you get 28 30 percent of our
 
03:44:28.950 --> 03:44:28.960 align:start position:0%
road budget that has to be returned to
 
03:44:32.070 --> 03:44:32.080 align:start position:0%
woodsville what happens is going forward
 
03:44:33.349 --> 03:44:33.359 align:start position:0%
for it
 
03:44:35.670 --> 03:44:35.680 align:start position:0%
for eternity every time the town of
 
03:44:37.670 --> 03:44:37.680 align:start position:0%
haverhill decides they need a plow they
 
03:44:39.510 --> 03:44:39.520 align:start position:0%
need a truck they need a greater they
 
03:44:41.349 --> 03:44:41.359 align:start position:0%
need to attend you know
 
03:44:43.030 --> 03:44:43.040 align:start position:0%
you have to add 30 percent to that
 
03:44:44.389 --> 03:44:44.399 align:start position:0%
purchase price
 
03:44:47.510 --> 03:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
to hand over to a municipality it's it's
 
03:44:49.429 --> 03:44:49.439 align:start position:0%
it's really not a fair or equitable
 
03:44:51.830 --> 03:44:51.840 align:start position:0%
solution it's uh it's heavily weighted
 
03:44:54.389 --> 03:44:54.399 align:start position:0%
it's a lose-lose situation for the town
 
03:44:55.429 --> 03:44:55.439 align:start position:0%
and and
 
03:44:56.870 --> 03:44:56.880 align:start position:0%
we don't begrudge the woodsville
 
03:44:58.469 --> 03:44:58.479 align:start position:0%
precinct anything they
 
03:45:00.309 --> 03:45:00.319 align:start position:0%
they have their well within their legal
 
03:45:02.070 --> 03:45:02.080 align:start position:0%
rights to have their own
 
03:45:02.080 --> 03:45:02.950 align:start position:0%
rights to have their own
um

03:45:02.950 --> 03:45:02.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:45:04.550 --> 03:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
highway department and
 
03:45:06.150 --> 03:45:06.160 align:start position:0%
you know maintain their roads as they
 
03:45:08.870 --> 03:45:08.880 align:start position:0%
see fit but they have the they have the
 
03:45:12.469 --> 03:45:12.479 align:start position:0%
obligation to pay for it themselves that
 
03:45:14.229 --> 03:45:14.239 align:start position:0%
they can only provide the services that
 
03:45:16.469 --> 03:45:16.479 align:start position:0%
their taxpayers are willing to
 
03:45:18.790 --> 03:45:18.800 align:start position:0%
to pay for and that's that's how i see
 
03:45:19.990 --> 03:45:20.000 align:start position:0%
it should work
 
03:45:20.000 --> 03:45:23.030 align:start position:0%
it should work
um

03:45:23.030 --> 03:45:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:25.349 --> 03:45:25.359 align:start position:0%
it's it's just
 
03:45:27.670 --> 03:45:27.680 align:start position:0%
it's just about fairness and and like i
 
03:45:29.670 --> 03:45:29.680 align:start position:0%
said that's what happens because it's
 
03:45:31.590 --> 03:45:31.600 align:start position:0%
it's a bad precedent to set going
 
03:45:33.189 --> 03:45:33.199 align:start position:0%
forward so
 
03:45:35.110 --> 03:45:35.120 align:start position:0%
you know on a statewide level what would
 
03:45:37.269 --> 03:45:37.279 align:start position:0%
happen if the larger municipality said
 
03:45:38.790 --> 03:45:38.800 align:start position:0%
to the state well we have our own police
 
03:45:39.990 --> 03:45:40.000 align:start position:0%
department we don't want to contribute
 
03:45:42.309 --> 03:45:42.319 align:start position:0%
to the state police it would slowly
 
03:45:44.469 --> 03:45:44.479 align:start position:0%
erode and this is this is just a law
 
03:45:45.990 --> 03:45:46.000 align:start position:0%
that really
 
03:45:48.630 --> 03:45:48.640 align:start position:0%
needs to be changed and i would please
 
03:45:48.640 --> 03:45:49.590 align:start position:0%
needs to be changed and i would please
uh

03:45:49.590 --> 03:45:49.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:45:51.910 --> 03:45:51.920 align:start position:0%
please please ask you to
 
03:45:54.870 --> 03:45:54.880 align:start position:0%
vote for sp 26 as it is amended thank
 
03:45:56.469 --> 03:45:56.479 align:start position:0%

03:45:56.479 --> 03:45:58.229 align:start position:0%

um

03:45:58.229 --> 03:45:58.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:46:01.990 --> 03:46:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:04.469 --> 03:46:04.479 align:start position:0%
mr chairman thank you and uh vice
 
03:46:06.070 --> 03:46:06.080 align:start position:0%
chairman jailbrook thank you very much
 
03:46:10.309 --> 03:46:10.319 align:start position:0%
for your testimony question i understand
 
03:46:12.389 --> 03:46:12.399 align:start position:0%
from doing my due diligence that last
 
03:46:14.469 --> 03:46:14.479 align:start position:0%
year the town of haverhill
 
03:46:16.229 --> 03:46:16.239 align:start position:0%
at their annual meeting decided to
 
03:46:18.150 --> 03:46:18.160 align:start position:0%
create their own fire department and
 
03:46:20.070 --> 03:46:20.080 align:start position:0%
that they would be inviting
 
03:46:22.469 --> 03:46:22.479 align:start position:0%
the north haverhill and haverhill corner
 
03:46:24.389 --> 03:46:24.399 align:start position:0%
fired precincts
 
03:46:26.309 --> 03:46:26.319 align:start position:0%
into that um
 
03:46:28.150 --> 03:46:28.160 align:start position:0%
new department that was created is is
 
03:46:28.160 --> 03:46:29.189 align:start position:0%
new department that was created is is
that

03:46:29.189 --> 03:46:29.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:46:30.950 --> 03:46:30.960 align:start position:0%
still the plan of attack for the town of
 
03:46:30.960 --> 03:46:31.910 align:start position:0%
still the plan of attack for the town of
haverhill

03:46:31.910 --> 03:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
haverhill
 
03:46:34.309 --> 03:46:34.319 align:start position:0%
oh yes sir our um
 
03:46:36.389 --> 03:46:36.399 align:start position:0%
i'll give you a once over the world on
 
03:46:38.229 --> 03:46:38.239 align:start position:0%
that um the uh
 
03:46:41.349 --> 03:46:41.359 align:start position:0%
it that plan initiated when um
 
03:46:43.510 --> 03:46:43.520 align:start position:0%
the haverhill corner people came to us
 
03:46:45.030 --> 03:46:45.040 align:start position:0%
with the idea of
 
03:46:47.030 --> 03:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
maybe becoming part of the town and
 
03:46:49.750 --> 03:46:49.760 align:start position:0%
forming a single department so we put a
 
03:46:51.750 --> 03:46:51.760 align:start position:0%
vote to the town's people at town
 
03:46:53.429 --> 03:46:53.439 align:start position:0%
meeting it was approved
 
03:46:55.750 --> 03:46:55.760 align:start position:0%
we had to obviously get the town to sign
 
03:46:57.189 --> 03:46:57.199 align:start position:0%
off on it first
 
03:47:01.189 --> 03:47:01.199 align:start position:0%
and and the bill as pat the
 
03:47:03.670 --> 03:47:03.680 align:start position:0%
warren article has passed stated that
 
03:47:05.030 --> 03:47:05.040 align:start position:0%
there was three
 
03:47:07.030 --> 03:47:07.040 align:start position:0%
fire departments within the town of
 
03:47:08.630 --> 03:47:08.640 align:start position:0%
haverhill that was haverhill corner
 
03:47:10.950 --> 03:47:10.960 align:start position:0%
north haverhill and woodsville so the
 
03:47:13.990 --> 03:47:14.000 align:start position:0%
town agreed to if the precincts
 
03:47:14.000 --> 03:47:14.790 align:start position:0%
town agreed to if the precincts
uh

03:47:14.790 --> 03:47:14.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:47:17.269 --> 03:47:17.279 align:start position:0%
approved to give up their
 
03:47:19.750 --> 03:47:19.760 align:start position:0%
fire responsibilities
 
03:47:22.309 --> 03:47:22.319 align:start position:0%
they would join the town fire department
 
03:47:23.750 --> 03:47:23.760 align:start position:0%
and then the town
 
03:47:26.870 --> 03:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
would pay for the entire department and
 
03:47:28.950 --> 03:47:28.960 align:start position:0%
north haverhill and haverhill corner
 
03:47:31.349 --> 03:47:31.359 align:start position:0%
both joined the fire department which is
 
03:47:32.870 --> 03:47:32.880 align:start position:0%
now the haverhill the town of haverhill
 
03:47:35.510 --> 03:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
fire department uh unfortunately
 
03:47:37.670 --> 03:47:37.680 align:start position:0%
woodsville um the commissioners the
 
03:47:39.269 --> 03:47:39.279 align:start position:0%
first year didn't put it they didn't
 
03:47:41.910 --> 03:47:41.920 align:start position:0%
allow it to be voted on and i believe
 
03:47:43.030 --> 03:47:43.040 align:start position:0%
this year
 
03:47:44.550 --> 03:47:44.560 align:start position:0%
they turned it down
 
03:47:44.560 --> 03:47:45.349 align:start position:0%
they turned it down
so

03:47:45.349 --> 03:47:45.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:47:47.030 --> 03:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
they chose not to become part of the
 
03:47:49.590 --> 03:47:49.600 align:start position:0%
town fire department unfortunately
 
03:47:52.309 --> 03:47:52.319 align:start position:0%
follow up mr chairman
 
03:47:54.630 --> 03:47:54.640 align:start position:0%

that uh town manager coddling provided
 
03:48:04.870 --> 03:48:04.880 align:start position:0%
i'm just trying to understand
 
03:48:06.630 --> 03:48:06.640 align:start position:0%
the relationship
 
03:48:08.870 --> 03:48:08.880 align:start position:0%
of the woodsville highway department as
 
03:48:10.630 --> 03:48:10.640 align:start position:0%
it relates to the woodsville fire
 
03:48:10.640 --> 03:48:11.670 align:start position:0%
it relates to the woodsville fire
district

03:48:11.670 --> 03:48:11.680 align:start position:0%
district
 
03:48:13.830 --> 03:48:13.840 align:start position:0%
are they are they a department under the
 
03:48:15.510 --> 03:48:15.520 align:start position:0%
woodsville fire district or are they
 
03:48:17.510 --> 03:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
department under the guise of the town
 
03:48:19.349 --> 03:48:19.359 align:start position:0%
of haverhill
 
03:48:21.189 --> 03:48:21.199 align:start position:0%
no they they fall into the woodsville
 
03:48:22.550 --> 03:48:22.560 align:start position:0%
fire district
 
03:48:23.990 --> 03:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
okay so it's their own highway
 
03:48:26.070 --> 03:48:26.080 align:start position:0%
department under the fire district
 
03:48:27.510 --> 03:48:27.520 align:start position:0%
that's correct sir
 
03:48:28.870 --> 03:48:28.880 align:start position:0%

03:48:30.550 --> 03:48:30.560 align:start position:0%

representative

03:48:34.630 --> 03:48:34.640 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:48:37.269 --> 03:48:37.279 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um thank you sir
 
03:48:38.870 --> 03:48:38.880 align:start position:0%
for being here
 
03:48:42.070 --> 03:48:42.080 align:start position:0%
um you folks are so involved in this and
 
03:48:43.750 --> 03:48:43.760 align:start position:0%
it's you know and i think we're all
 
03:48:46.070 --> 03:48:46.080 align:start position:0%
trying to get up to speed to understand
 
03:48:48.150 --> 03:48:48.160 align:start position:0%
uh the situation
 
03:48:48.160 --> 03:48:49.269 align:start position:0%
uh the situation
um

03:48:49.269 --> 03:48:49.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:48:51.750 --> 03:48:51.760 align:start position:0%
i can't find the statute that this is
 
03:48:54.950 --> 03:48:54.960 align:start position:0%
amending on online so i see everything
 
03:48:57.990 --> 03:48:58.000 align:start position:0%
in its totality someone testified they
 
03:49:00.790 --> 03:49:00.800 align:start position:0%
said this is the maybe it was you uh
 
03:49:03.110 --> 03:49:03.120 align:start position:0%
that this is the only situation in the
 
03:49:06.309 --> 03:49:06.319 align:start position:0%
entire state of new hampshire like this
 
03:49:06.319 --> 03:49:07.349 align:start position:0%
entire state of new hampshire like this
so

03:49:07.349 --> 03:49:07.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:49:07.359 --> 03:49:08.389 align:start position:0%
so
if

03:49:08.389 --> 03:49:08.399 align:start position:0%
if
 
03:49:10.790 --> 03:49:10.800 align:start position:0%
if you just take us back in time i'm
 
03:49:12.710 --> 03:49:12.720 align:start position:0%
trying to understand why this
 
03:49:15.990 --> 03:49:16.000 align:start position:0%
is in state law in the first place uh
 
03:49:17.830 --> 03:49:17.840 align:start position:0%
was it because there was so much
 
03:49:20.389 --> 03:49:20.399 align:start position:0%
division um somebody just tried to
 
03:49:22.950 --> 03:49:22.960 align:start position:0%
settle it through legislation
 
03:49:27.189 --> 03:49:27.199 align:start position:0%
or how did this come to pass
 
03:49:31.429 --> 03:49:31.439 align:start position:0%
uh this the original uh law it predates
 
03:49:34.870 --> 03:49:34.880 align:start position:0%
me obviously um by believe the um over
 
03:49:37.110 --> 03:49:37.120 align:start position:0%
the over time there's been numerous
 
03:49:39.750 --> 03:49:39.760 align:start position:0%
amendments and they've come back to the
 
03:49:41.429 --> 03:49:41.439 align:start position:0%
state to amend it
 
03:49:41.439 --> 03:49:42.790 align:start position:0%
state to amend it
um

03:49:42.790 --> 03:49:42.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:49:44.630 --> 03:49:44.640 align:start position:0%
i i don't know i couldn't uh
 
03:49:46.229 --> 03:49:46.239 align:start position:0%
intelligently speak to when the first
 
03:49:48.870 --> 03:49:48.880 align:start position:0%
law was enacted regarding this but i
 
03:49:51.030 --> 03:49:51.040 align:start position:0%
believe the recent the most recent
 
03:49:54.309 --> 03:49:54.319 align:start position:0%
amendment to it i think was 2009
 
03:49:57.269 --> 03:49:57.279 align:start position:0%
if i'm if i'm uh correct
 
03:50:00.309 --> 03:50:00.319 align:start position:0%
well i i just as a follow-up just as a
 
03:50:02.070 --> 03:50:02.080 align:start position:0%
matter of history i was trying to
 
03:50:05.030 --> 03:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
understand how how this came to pass in
 
03:50:07.269 --> 03:50:07.279 align:start position:0%
the first place um
 
03:50:07.279 --> 03:50:09.030 align:start position:0%
the first place um
so

03:50:09.030 --> 03:50:09.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:50:11.030 --> 03:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
my other question is one of the people
 
03:50:13.670 --> 03:50:13.680 align:start position:0%
testified that if
 
03:50:16.469 --> 03:50:16.479 align:start position:0%
this law was passed people in woodsville
 
03:50:19.269 --> 03:50:19.279 align:start position:0%
would be double taxed and i wondered if
 
03:50:21.910 --> 03:50:21.920 align:start position:0%
you could speak to that
 
03:50:26.229 --> 03:50:26.239 align:start position:0%
um sure well i i can't speak to what um
 
03:50:28.150 --> 03:50:28.160 align:start position:0%
i think it was mr robbins that stated i
 
03:50:30.469 --> 03:50:30.479 align:start position:0%
can't speak to what he what he meant
 
03:50:32.150 --> 03:50:32.160 align:start position:0%
but um
 
03:50:35.990 --> 03:50:36.000 align:start position:0%
double taxed um well no because
 
03:50:38.550 --> 03:50:38.560 align:start position:0%
when you pay into the high will highway
 
03:50:41.670 --> 03:50:41.680 align:start position:0%
uh tax the highway taxes in the town
 
03:50:43.269 --> 03:50:43.279 align:start position:0%
you're contributing to
 
03:50:44.469 --> 03:50:44.479 align:start position:0%
all of
 
03:50:46.550 --> 03:50:46.560 align:start position:0%
the town roads not just
 
03:50:49.110 --> 03:50:49.120 align:start position:0%
you know a specific precinct
 
03:50:49.120 --> 03:50:50.309 align:start position:0%
you know a specific precinct
so

03:50:50.309 --> 03:50:50.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:50:53.349 --> 03:50:53.359 align:start position:0%
like i said we all contribute um
 
03:50:55.189 --> 03:50:55.199 align:start position:0%
i guess i could say it like this for
 
03:50:59.349 --> 03:50:59.359 align:start position:0%
example we i i pay taxes to the state
 
03:51:00.630 --> 03:51:00.640 align:start position:0%
and and
 
03:51:03.910 --> 03:51:03.920 align:start position:0%
by extension the um
 
03:51:05.750 --> 03:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
the county for
 
03:51:08.150 --> 03:51:08.160 align:start position:0%
and that pays for the state police it
 
03:51:09.510 --> 03:51:09.520 align:start position:0%
pays for the
 
03:51:11.189 --> 03:51:11.199 align:start position:0%
county sheriff's department yet
 
03:51:13.030 --> 03:51:13.040 align:start position:0%
haverhill we have our own town police
 
03:51:13.040 --> 03:51:14.229 align:start position:0%
haverhill we have our own town police
department

03:51:14.229 --> 03:51:14.239 align:start position:0%
department
 
03:51:15.910 --> 03:51:15.920 align:start position:0%
i mean would you consider that double
 
03:51:18.550 --> 03:51:18.560 align:start position:0%
taxation i wouldn't because
 
03:51:20.229 --> 03:51:20.239 align:start position:0%
the town chooses
 
03:51:23.110 --> 03:51:23.120 align:start position:0%
to have our own police department so for
 
03:51:25.189 --> 03:51:25.199 align:start position:0%
that we have to raise the taxes through
 
03:51:27.429 --> 03:51:27.439 align:start position:0%
the town and pay for that it doesn't it
 
03:51:29.030 --> 03:51:29.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't relinquish us of our
 
03:51:31.510 --> 03:51:31.520 align:start position:0%
responsibilities to contribute to the
 
03:51:33.670 --> 03:51:33.680 align:start position:0%
state police or the county
 
03:51:35.189 --> 03:51:35.199 align:start position:0%
sheriff's department we can't say oh we
 
03:51:36.790 --> 03:51:36.800 align:start position:0%
have our own we don't want to contribute
 
03:51:39.990 --> 03:51:40.000 align:start position:0%
i i don't see that as double taxation
 
03:51:40.950 --> 03:51:40.960 align:start position:0%
it just
 
03:51:42.790 --> 03:51:42.800 align:start position:0%
if you want to improve your services to
 
03:51:45.189 --> 03:51:45.199 align:start position:0%
your specific community as we do with
 
03:51:47.269 --> 03:51:47.279 align:start position:0%
the town for example with the police
 
03:51:49.590 --> 03:51:49.600 align:start position:0%
department it's just a burden that we
 
03:51:52.070 --> 03:51:52.080 align:start position:0%
have to shoulder if we want that so i i
 
03:51:53.510 --> 03:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
really wouldn't see that ma'am as double
 
03:51:53.520 --> 03:51:55.030 align:start position:0%
really wouldn't see that ma'am as double
taxation

03:51:55.030 --> 03:51:55.040 align:start position:0%
taxation
 
03:51:58.309 --> 03:51:58.319 align:start position:0%
just one more follow-up mr chair
 
03:51:59.670 --> 03:51:59.680 align:start position:0%
um okay
 
03:51:59.680 --> 03:52:01.110 align:start position:0%
um okay
so

03:52:01.110 --> 03:52:01.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:52:02.790 --> 03:52:02.800 align:start position:0%
there's been a couple of statements
 
03:52:05.030 --> 03:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
regarding local control what is and
 
03:52:07.830 --> 03:52:07.840 align:start position:0%
isn't local control is it your testimony
 
03:52:10.710 --> 03:52:10.720 align:start position:0%
then that the laws that currently exist
 
03:52:13.189 --> 03:52:13.199 align:start position:0%
does not allow for local control and if
 
03:52:15.990 --> 03:52:16.000 align:start position:0%
this bill was passed it would return
 
03:52:18.150 --> 03:52:18.160 align:start position:0%
local control to
 
03:52:18.160 --> 03:52:18.950 align:start position:0%
local control to
um

03:52:18.950 --> 03:52:18.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:52:22.070 --> 03:52:22.080 align:start position:0%
the people of haverhill and woodsville
 
03:52:24.150 --> 03:52:24.160 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am absolutely just as i had
 
03:52:26.710 --> 03:52:26.720 align:start position:0%
stated before if it would allow it would
 
03:52:28.950 --> 03:52:28.960 align:start position:0%
it would unshackle the town
 
03:52:31.030 --> 03:52:31.040 align:start position:0%
and we wouldn't have to be
 
03:52:32.389 --> 03:52:32.399 align:start position:0%
paying for
 
03:52:35.510 --> 03:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
a department of another municipality
 
03:52:35.520 --> 03:52:36.469 align:start position:0%
a department of another municipality
so

03:52:36.469 --> 03:52:36.479 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:52:40.070 --> 03:52:40.080 align:start position:0%
if woodsville wants to have a fire a
 
03:52:40.080 --> 03:52:41.910 align:start position:0%
if woodsville wants to have a fire a
road

03:52:41.910 --> 03:52:41.920 align:start position:0%
road
 
03:52:44.229 --> 03:52:44.239 align:start position:0%
a highway department for themselves then
 
03:52:45.990 --> 03:52:46.000 align:start position:0%
they pay for it and then they the
 
03:52:47.910 --> 03:52:47.920 align:start position:0%
taxpayer in woodsville decides how big
 
03:52:49.429 --> 03:52:49.439 align:start position:0%
they need
 
03:52:51.349 --> 03:52:51.359 align:start position:0%
or how you know how much they want to
 
03:52:52.950 --> 03:52:52.960 align:start position:0%
spend to take care of their eight miles
 
03:52:54.870 --> 03:52:54.880 align:start position:0%
of road and then that would allow the
 
03:52:57.429 --> 03:52:57.439 align:start position:0%
town to take care of its roads with the
 
03:53:01.910 --> 03:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:03.990 --> 03:53:04.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:53:11.349 --> 03:53:11.359 align:start position:0%

year as haverhill cooperative school
 
03:54:13.349 --> 03:54:13.359 align:start position:0%
board chairman
 
03:54:16.870 --> 03:54:16.880 align:start position:0%
um i've spent 35 plus years in the town
 
03:54:19.030 --> 03:54:19.040 align:start position:0%
of haverhill on various boards and
 
03:54:20.870 --> 03:54:20.880 align:start position:0%
commissions including being
 
03:54:22.389 --> 03:54:22.399 align:start position:0%
the woodsville board of commissioners
 
03:54:25.670 --> 03:54:25.680 align:start position:0%
chairman in 2008 and 9 when the current
 
03:54:27.830 --> 03:54:27.840 align:start position:0%
legislation was passed
 
03:54:31.590 --> 03:54:31.600 align:start position:0%
this current legislation was the work of
 
03:54:33.750 --> 03:54:33.760 align:start position:0%
unanimous work of the haverhill select
 
03:54:36.229 --> 03:54:36.239 align:start position:0%
board and the woodsville commission
 
03:54:38.630 --> 03:54:38.640 align:start position:0%
the select board under rick glad we all
 
03:54:40.150 --> 03:54:40.160 align:start position:0%
know and
 
03:54:42.630 --> 03:54:42.640 align:start position:0%
town manager glenn english and it solved
 
03:54:44.550 --> 03:54:44.560 align:start position:0%
some real problems
 
03:54:47.910 --> 03:54:47.920 align:start position:0%
that bill in 2009
 
03:54:50.710 --> 03:54:50.720 align:start position:0%
uh did receive unanimous support but the
 
03:54:53.510 --> 03:54:53.520 align:start position:0%
ones that before you today is not
 
03:54:56.070 --> 03:54:56.080 align:start position:0%
receiving unanimous support locally in
 
03:54:58.229 --> 03:54:58.239 align:start position:0%
fact i believe you'll find that two of
 
03:55:00.950 --> 03:55:00.960 align:start position:0%
the five favorable select board members
 
03:55:03.830 --> 03:55:03.840 align:start position:0%
are registered as opposed to it on your
 
03:55:06.150 --> 03:55:06.160 align:start position:0%
list today and all of the woodsville
 
03:55:08.309 --> 03:55:08.319 align:start position:0%
precinct commissioners are opposed to it
 
03:55:09.910 --> 03:55:09.920 align:start position:0%
as well
 
03:55:12.710 --> 03:55:12.720 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the bill before you today
 
03:55:14.950 --> 03:55:14.960 align:start position:0%
recreates the very problem that the
 
03:55:16.710 --> 03:55:16.720 align:start position:0%
current law was
 
03:55:18.469 --> 03:55:18.479 align:start position:0%
was solving
 
03:55:21.189 --> 03:55:21.199 align:start position:0%
it has woodsville property i'm sorry
 
03:55:23.990 --> 03:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
woodsville taxpayers paying for its own
 
03:55:26.870 --> 03:55:26.880 align:start position:0%
highway department plus a large share of
 
03:55:28.710 --> 03:55:28.720 align:start position:0%
the cost of the haverhill department
 
03:55:31.030 --> 03:55:31.040 align:start position:0%
department and it is considered or it
 
03:55:33.349 --> 03:55:33.359 align:start position:0%
was considered double taxation back in
 
03:55:33.359 --> 03:55:35.510 align:start position:0%
was considered double taxation back in
2009

03:55:35.510 --> 03:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
2009
 
03:55:38.309 --> 03:55:38.319 align:start position:0%
the current loss solved the problem
 
03:55:40.790 --> 03:55:40.800 align:start position:0%
and it works like this the people served
 
03:55:42.950 --> 03:55:42.960 align:start position:0%
by the woodsville highway department pay
 
03:55:44.950 --> 03:55:44.960 align:start position:0%
for the woodsville highway department
 
03:55:46.950 --> 03:55:46.960 align:start position:0%
the people in haverhill
 
03:55:48.469 --> 03:55:48.479 align:start position:0%
that are served by the haverhill highway
 
03:55:50.389 --> 03:55:50.399 align:start position:0%
department pay for the haverhill highway
 
03:55:52.950 --> 03:55:52.960 align:start position:0%
department that is how it works
 
03:55:55.269 --> 03:55:55.279 align:start position:0%
all of the in all of the discussion
 
03:55:57.590 --> 03:55:57.600 align:start position:0%
today about how haverhill people are
 
03:56:00.150 --> 03:56:00.160 align:start position:0%
paying for woodsville or subsidizing
 
03:56:03.269 --> 03:56:03.279 align:start position:0%
it's just plain on true and it's it's i
 
03:56:05.030 --> 03:56:05.040 align:start position:0%
think because
 
03:56:07.189 --> 03:56:07.199 align:start position:0%
the people that are speaking to you
 
03:56:09.590 --> 03:56:09.600 align:start position:0%
don't fully understand how it works i
 
03:56:11.510 --> 03:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
think rick ladd has a very good handle
 
03:56:13.910 --> 03:56:13.920 align:start position:0%
on it and i'm sure he's spoken to you
 
03:56:15.990 --> 03:56:16.000 align:start position:0%
about it in the past
 
03:56:18.550 --> 03:56:18.560 align:start position:0%
one nice lady just a moment ago asked
 
03:56:18.560 --> 03:56:19.910 align:start position:0%
one nice lady just a moment ago asked
about

03:56:19.910 --> 03:56:19.920 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:56:23.269 --> 03:56:23.279 align:start position:0%
the woodsville highway
 
03:56:25.189 --> 03:56:25.199 align:start position:0%
having its own department and i'll just
 
03:56:28.150 --> 03:56:28.160 align:start position:0%
throw in that um we've had two highway
 
03:56:29.750 --> 03:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
departments and it's been mutually
 
03:56:31.670 --> 03:56:31.680 align:start position:0%
beneficial and served the town and
 
03:56:34.389 --> 03:56:34.399 align:start position:0%
village well for a very very long time
 
03:56:37.189 --> 03:56:37.199 align:start position:0%
perhaps up to about 100 years
 
03:56:39.030 --> 03:56:39.040 align:start position:0%
the bill we're talking about today is
 
03:56:41.269 --> 03:56:41.279 align:start position:0%
only about funding
 
03:56:43.030 --> 03:56:43.040 align:start position:0%
why are we here
 
03:56:43.040 --> 03:56:43.670 align:start position:0%
why are we here
and

03:56:43.670 --> 03:56:43.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:56:45.349 --> 03:56:45.359 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry but let me be a little blunt
 
03:56:48.469 --> 03:56:48.479 align:start position:0%
about this prior to 2019 haverhill was a
 
03:56:50.790 --> 03:56:50.800 align:start position:0%
very peaceful and cooperative town the
 
03:56:52.630 --> 03:56:52.640 align:start position:0%
highway departments worked together when
 
03:56:55.110 --> 03:56:55.120 align:start position:0%
they needed a little extra help
 
03:56:57.189 --> 03:56:57.199 align:start position:0%
we didn't keep a ledger of the time we
 
03:56:59.510 --> 03:56:59.520 align:start position:0%
just did it
 
03:57:01.349 --> 03:57:01.359 align:start position:0%
since the hiring of our new town manager
 
03:57:03.110 --> 03:57:03.120 align:start position:0%
woodsville has been under siege from
 
03:57:05.269 --> 03:57:05.279 align:start position:0%
town management you will find that the
 
03:57:07.349 --> 03:57:07.359 align:start position:0%
town manager is articulate and charming
 
03:57:09.510 --> 03:57:09.520 align:start position:0%
as you've just heard but she has worked
 
03:57:12.150 --> 03:57:12.160 align:start position:0%
hard to disrupt all the relationships
 
03:57:14.309 --> 03:57:14.319 align:start position:0%
using bullying tactics that include
 
03:57:17.429 --> 03:57:17.439 align:start position:0%
threats of defunding to enlisting
 
03:57:20.070 --> 03:57:20.080 align:start position:0%
you folks in concord to be uh her heavy
 
03:57:20.080 --> 03:57:21.030 align:start position:0%
you folks in concord to be uh her heavy
hand

03:57:21.030 --> 03:57:21.040 align:start position:0%
hand
 
03:57:23.030 --> 03:57:23.040 align:start position:0%
she has defunded the woodsville fire
 
03:57:23.040 --> 03:57:24.630 align:start position:0%
she has defunded the woodsville fire
department

03:57:24.630 --> 03:57:24.640 align:start position:0%
department
 
03:57:26.870 --> 03:57:26.880 align:start position:0%
over a control issue she has threatened
 
03:57:32.389 --> 03:57:32.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:34.550 --> 03:57:34.560 align:start position:0%
and they have pardoned me
 
03:57:36.550 --> 03:57:36.560 align:start position:0%
to threaten haverhill corner fire
 
03:57:39.110 --> 03:57:39.120 align:start position:0%
department over um defunding and they
 
03:57:40.710 --> 03:57:40.720 align:start position:0%
finally gave in
 
03:57:42.790 --> 03:57:42.800 align:start position:0%
she's attempted to defund or reduce the
 
03:57:45.110 --> 03:57:45.120 align:start position:0%
funding or replace woodsville ambulance
 
03:57:48.070 --> 03:57:48.080 align:start position:0%
of which i was a member um and still am
 
03:57:50.070 --> 03:57:50.080 align:start position:0%
for over 40 years now
 
03:57:52.550 --> 03:57:52.560 align:start position:0%
and the public did speak up very
 
03:57:54.389 --> 03:57:54.399 align:start position:0%
harshly about that and they backed away
 
03:57:57.110 --> 03:57:57.120 align:start position:0%
from it she's refused to pay the town's
 
03:57:59.269 --> 03:57:59.279 align:start position:0%
obligations to the woodsville sewer
 
03:58:01.590 --> 03:58:01.600 align:start position:0%
department and she has enlisted the
 
03:58:03.670 --> 03:58:03.680 align:start position:0%
senate and now the house to fight
 
03:58:06.150 --> 03:58:06.160 align:start position:0%
letting woodsville keep its local share
 
03:58:08.790 --> 03:58:08.800 align:start position:0%
of highway funds the people of hayward
 
03:58:11.189 --> 03:58:11.199 align:start position:0%
are not sending money to woodsville if
 
03:58:13.030 --> 03:58:13.040 align:start position:0%
they took the time to understand how it
 
03:58:14.790 --> 03:58:14.800 align:start position:0%
works they would know that
 
03:58:16.469 --> 03:58:16.479 align:start position:0%
the funding of our highway departments
 
03:58:18.309 --> 03:58:18.319 align:start position:0%
is simple if you make an effort to
 
03:58:19.910 --> 03:58:19.920 align:start position:0%
understand it
 
03:58:21.670 --> 03:58:21.680 align:start position:0%
when this started the town manager and
 
03:58:23.429 --> 03:58:23.439 align:start position:0%
select board didn't understand how it
 
03:58:25.510 --> 03:58:25.520 align:start position:0%
works and they believed haverhill was
 
03:58:27.830 --> 03:58:27.840 align:start position:0%
subsidizing woodsville and with the town
 
03:58:30.950 --> 03:58:30.960 align:start position:0%
manager in charge as we recently found
 
03:58:34.469 --> 03:58:34.479 align:start position:0%
out she has blockaded any
 
03:58:37.349 --> 03:58:37.359 align:start position:0%
efforts recent efforts to get together
 
03:58:39.510 --> 03:58:39.520 align:start position:0%
and discuss this as a group sorry i'm
 
03:58:41.189 --> 03:58:41.199 align:start position:0%
stammering a little bit i'm not a great
 
03:58:41.199 --> 03:58:42.550 align:start position:0%
stammering a little bit i'm not a great
speaker

03:58:42.550 --> 03:58:42.560 align:start position:0%
speaker
 
03:58:44.229 --> 03:58:44.239 align:start position:0%
at every turn over the last two years
 
03:58:45.830 --> 03:58:45.840 align:start position:0%
the town manager has been building a
 
03:58:48.070 --> 03:58:48.080 align:start position:0%
wall between haverhill and woodsville
 
03:58:49.990 --> 03:58:50.000 align:start position:0%
as the haverhill school board chair i
 
03:58:52.229 --> 03:58:52.239 align:start position:0%
fear where this is going there is now a
 
03:58:54.309 --> 03:58:54.319 align:start position:0%
strong sentiment in woodsville to
 
03:58:56.389 --> 03:58:56.399 align:start position:0%
disengage from haverhill
 
03:58:58.389 --> 03:58:58.399 align:start position:0%
this bill as written could be that final
 
03:58:59.910 --> 03:58:59.920 align:start position:0%
brick in the wall
 
03:59:02.469 --> 03:59:02.479 align:start position:0%
sorry for the pink floyd reference
 
03:59:04.389 --> 03:59:04.399 align:start position:0%
if woods phil splits from the school
 
03:59:04.399 --> 03:59:05.990 align:start position:0%
if woods phil splits from the school
district

03:59:05.990 --> 03:59:06.000 align:start position:0%
district
 
03:59:08.630 --> 03:59:08.640 align:start position:0%
we will have a real problem keeping
 
03:59:10.550 --> 03:59:10.560 align:start position:0%
our table cooperative school system
 
03:59:10.560 --> 03:59:11.590 align:start position:0%
our table cooperative school system
going

03:59:11.590 --> 03:59:11.600 align:start position:0%
going
 
03:59:13.750 --> 03:59:13.760 align:start position:0%
this bill is no more
 
03:59:15.990 --> 03:59:16.000 align:start position:0%
than a tool that the town manager has
 
03:59:18.309 --> 03:59:18.319 align:start position:0%
found to further her agenda i ask that
 
03:59:20.150 --> 03:59:20.160 align:start position:0%
you reject this or return these
 
03:59:22.309 --> 03:59:22.319 align:start position:0%
discussions to the local level
 
03:59:24.710 --> 03:59:24.720 align:start position:0%
we're given a we're given a recent
 
03:59:26.710 --> 03:59:26.720 align:start position:0%
petition for her
 
03:59:26.720 --> 03:59:27.990 align:start position:0%
petition for her
dismissal

04:00:09.510 --> 04:00:09.520 align:start position:0%
merging the fire departments is trying
 
04:00:11.349 --> 04:00:11.359 align:start position:0%
to solve
 
04:00:13.510 --> 04:00:13.520 align:start position:0%
we have been training our fire
 
04:00:14.790 --> 04:00:14.800 align:start position:0%

i also went back for a brief period of
 
04:02:13.359 --> 04:02:14.469 align:start position:0%
i also went back for a brief period of
time

04:02:14.469 --> 04:02:14.479 align:start position:0%
time
 
04:02:16.630 --> 04:02:16.640 align:start position:0%
when my successor resigned
 
04:02:18.950 --> 04:02:18.960 align:start position:0%
and worked an additional eight months
 
04:02:20.870 --> 04:02:20.880 align:start position:0%
to help the selectmen
 
04:02:22.950 --> 04:02:22.960 align:start position:0%
get to a process of hiring a new town
 
04:02:22.960 --> 04:02:25.030 align:start position:0%
get to a process of hiring a new town
manager

04:02:25.030 --> 04:02:25.040 align:start position:0%
manager
 
04:02:27.110 --> 04:02:27.120 align:start position:0%
i was a town resident and taxpayer
 
04:02:28.550 --> 04:02:28.560 align:start position:0%
during my tenure
 
04:02:30.630 --> 04:02:30.640 align:start position:0%
and continue to happily reside in the
 
04:02:30.640 --> 04:02:31.510 align:start position:0%
and continue to happily reside in the
town

04:02:31.510 --> 04:02:31.520 align:start position:0%
town
 
04:02:33.830 --> 04:02:33.840 align:start position:0%
i pay taxes to both the town and the
 
04:02:35.990 --> 04:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
woodsville fire district where i am
 
04:02:38.630 --> 04:02:38.640 align:start position:0%
involved in a family business
 
04:02:40.469 --> 04:02:40.479 align:start position:0%
during my tenure as haverhill town
 
04:02:40.479 --> 04:02:41.670 align:start position:0%
during my tenure as haverhill town
manager

04:02:41.670 --> 04:02:41.680 align:start position:0%
manager
 
04:02:43.990 --> 04:02:44.000 align:start position:0%
i and the board of selectmen worked hard
 
04:02:46.229 --> 04:02:46.239 align:start position:0%
to establish and maintain
 
04:02:48.710 --> 04:02:48.720 align:start position:0%
a positive working relationship with the
 
04:02:50.550 --> 04:02:50.560 align:start position:0%
several village districts
 
04:02:52.469 --> 04:02:52.479 align:start position:0%
which provide some
 
04:02:54.710 --> 04:02:54.720 align:start position:0%
defined municipal services to their
 
04:02:57.510 --> 04:02:57.520 align:start position:0%
constituents within the greater town
 
04:03:00.070 --> 04:03:00.080 align:start position:0%
i think the definition of municipality
 
04:03:01.910 --> 04:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
has been
 
04:03:04.070 --> 04:03:04.080 align:start position:0%
misinterpreted by some of the people
 
04:03:04.080 --> 04:03:05.990 align:start position:0%
misinterpreted by some of the people
testifying

04:03:05.990 --> 04:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
testifying
 
04:03:08.229 --> 04:03:08.239 align:start position:0%
to me a municipality
 
04:03:10.710 --> 04:03:10.720 align:start position:0%
that is totally separate from another
 
04:03:13.750 --> 04:03:13.760 align:start position:0%
municipality is not the same thing
 
04:03:16.550 --> 04:03:16.560 align:start position:0%
as a fire district or a village district
 
04:03:19.990 --> 04:03:20.000 align:start position:0%
municipal unit within a town there are
 
04:03:23.429 --> 04:03:23.439 align:start position:0%
shared resources and shared benefits
 
04:03:25.189 --> 04:03:25.199 align:start position:0%
all the people in haverhill use the
 
04:03:27.670 --> 04:03:27.680 align:start position:0%
woods use the roads in woodsville as
 
04:03:29.910 --> 04:03:29.920 align:start position:0%
well as tourists it's our business
 
04:03:29.920 --> 04:03:30.790 align:start position:0%
well as tourists it's our business
center

04:03:30.790 --> 04:03:30.800 align:start position:0%
center
 
04:03:32.550 --> 04:03:32.560 align:start position:0%
all of the many of the people in
 
04:03:34.870 --> 04:03:34.880 align:start position:0%
woodsville use the roads in haverhill so
 
04:03:36.790 --> 04:03:36.800 align:start position:0%
it's not like there are two distinct
 
04:03:39.510 --> 04:03:39.520 align:start position:0%
municipalities with a brick wall between
 
04:03:43.670 --> 04:03:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:46.309 --> 04:03:46.319 align:start position:0%
many of the other districts provide
 
04:03:48.550 --> 04:03:48.560 align:start position:0%
services that benefit the whole town as
 
04:03:48.560 --> 04:03:49.990 align:start position:0%
services that benefit the whole town as
well

04:03:49.990 --> 04:03:50.000 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:03:52.790 --> 04:03:52.800 align:start position:0%
i won't go into that detail but we have
 
04:03:55.429 --> 04:03:55.439 align:start position:0%
about four different village districts
 
04:03:57.110 --> 04:03:57.120 align:start position:0%
water and light departments are done
 
04:04:00.469 --> 04:04:00.479 align:start position:0%
locally in the district level um and one
 
04:04:03.189 --> 04:04:03.199 align:start position:0%
of our districts mountain lakes has a
 
04:04:05.750 --> 04:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
aggressive recreation department that
 
04:04:09.349 --> 04:04:09.359 align:start position:0%
benefits the whole town in instances
 
04:04:10.870 --> 04:04:10.880 align:start position:0%
we have
 
04:04:13.030 --> 04:04:13.040 align:start position:0%
our traditions honor
 
04:04:15.590 --> 04:04:15.600 align:start position:0%
government services at the very local
 
04:04:15.600 --> 04:04:16.469 align:start position:0%
government services at the very local
level

04:04:16.469 --> 04:04:16.479 align:start position:0%
level
 
04:04:18.950 --> 04:04:18.960 align:start position:0%
that is why we have so much diversity of
 
04:04:20.469 --> 04:04:20.479 align:start position:0%
our local government
 
04:04:22.630 --> 04:04:22.640 align:start position:0%
and the town administration
 
04:04:24.469 --> 04:04:24.479 align:start position:0%
the current town administration doesn't
 
04:04:26.229 --> 04:04:26.239 align:start position:0%
understand that
 
04:04:28.469 --> 04:04:28.479 align:start position:0%
this has worked well over the years as
 
04:04:30.550 --> 04:04:30.560 align:start position:0%
long as the lines of communication have
 
04:04:32.790 --> 04:04:32.800 align:start position:0%
remained open and cooperative
 
04:04:34.870 --> 04:04:34.880 align:start position:0%
unfortunately that is not now the case
 
04:04:36.469 --> 04:04:36.479 align:start position:0%
in haverhill
 
04:04:38.710 --> 04:04:38.720 align:start position:0%
as i see it this proposed legislation
 
04:04:42.309 --> 04:04:42.319 align:start position:0%
will end fair taxation and local control
 
04:04:44.710 --> 04:04:44.720 align:start position:0%
for the woodsville taxpayers it will
 
04:04:47.269 --> 04:04:47.279 align:start position:0%
also mandate overly extensive audit
 
04:04:49.590 --> 04:04:49.600 align:start position:0%
requirements on the district
 
04:04:51.830 --> 04:04:51.840 align:start position:0%
well beyond any audit requirements of
 
04:04:54.309 --> 04:04:54.319 align:start position:0%
any other municipality
 
04:04:57.510 --> 04:04:57.520 align:start position:0%
sb 26 will end the long established
 
04:04:57.520 --> 04:04:58.469 align:start position:0%
sb 26 will end the long established
practice

04:04:58.469 --> 04:04:58.479 align:start position:0%
practice
 
04:05:00.630 --> 04:05:00.640 align:start position:0%
of returning a percentage of highway
 
04:05:03.269 --> 04:05:03.279 align:start position:0%
funds raised by property taxation in the
 
04:05:03.279 --> 04:05:04.389 align:start position:0%
funds raised by property taxation in the
town

04:05:04.389 --> 04:05:04.399 align:start position:0%
town
 
04:05:06.870 --> 04:05:06.880 align:start position:0%
based on the town's assessed values to
 
04:05:09.269 --> 04:05:09.279 align:start position:0%
the haverhill taxpayers who live in
 
04:05:09.279 --> 04:05:10.389 align:start position:0%
the haverhill taxpayers who live in
woodsville

04:05:10.389 --> 04:05:10.399 align:start position:0%
woodsville
 
04:05:13.030 --> 04:05:13.040 align:start position:0%
the woodsville taxpayers are also
 
04:05:15.670 --> 04:05:15.680 align:start position:0%
behavioral tax taxpayers you need to
 
04:05:18.309 --> 04:05:18.319 align:start position:0%
understand that very important
 
04:05:20.710 --> 04:05:20.720 align:start position:0%
this would result in haverhill taxpayers
 
04:05:23.110 --> 04:05:23.120 align:start position:0%
in woodsville paying for two highway
 
04:05:23.120 --> 04:05:24.550 align:start position:0%
in woodsville paying for two highway
departments

04:05:24.550 --> 04:05:24.560 align:start position:0%
departments
 
04:05:26.870 --> 04:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
paying for two highway departments
 
04:05:30.309 --> 04:05:30.319 align:start position:0%
double taxation
 
04:05:32.950 --> 04:05:32.960 align:start position:0%
the second issue local control requires
 
04:05:34.710 --> 04:05:34.720 align:start position:0%
a brief look at history
 
04:05:36.309 --> 04:05:36.319 align:start position:0%
the woodsville highway department
 
04:05:38.950 --> 04:05:38.960 align:start position:0%
predates the town's highway department
 
04:05:42.070 --> 04:05:42.080 align:start position:0%
it was established in the late 1800s to
 
04:05:44.389 --> 04:05:44.399 align:start position:0%
build and maintain woodsville's city
 
04:05:44.399 --> 04:05:45.830 align:start position:0%
build and maintain woodsville's city
streets

04:05:45.830 --> 04:05:45.840 align:start position:0%
streets
 
04:05:47.910 --> 04:05:47.920 align:start position:0%
these streets are paved and in some
 
04:05:50.710 --> 04:05:50.720 align:start position:0%
cases have curbing and sidewalks and
 
04:05:52.710 --> 04:05:52.720 align:start position:0%
closed drainage systems
 
04:05:54.469 --> 04:05:54.479 align:start position:0%
they are expensive to maintain in
 
04:05:57.269 --> 04:05:57.279 align:start position:0%
relation to the town's roads which are
 
04:06:00.469 --> 04:06:00.479 align:start position:0%
rural mostly dirt with open ditches for
 
04:06:03.590 --> 04:06:03.600 align:start position:0%
drainage the taxpayers in woodsville are
 
04:06:05.189 --> 04:06:05.199 align:start position:0%
happy and have been happy with their

in fact the woodsville fire district
 
04:06:11.110 --> 04:06:11.120 align:start position:0%
boundaries were enlarged by the
 
04:06:14.150 --> 04:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
selectmen in the early 1990s because the
 
04:06:16.309 --> 04:06:16.319 align:start position:0%
town was doing such a poor job
 
04:06:18.469 --> 04:06:18.479 align:start position:0%
maintaining swift water road which
 
04:06:23.189 --> 04:06:23.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:25.910 --> 04:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
since the town government began to make
 
04:06:28.150 --> 04:06:28.160 align:start position:0%
incorrect allocation of the highway
 
04:06:30.630 --> 04:06:30.640 align:start position:0%

under the present town manager
 
04:06:35.429 --> 04:06:35.439 align:start position:0%
a violation of the current statute by
 
04:06:36.469 --> 04:06:36.479 align:start position:0%
the way
 
04:06:38.469 --> 04:06:38.479 align:start position:0%
the district commissioners were forced
 
04:06:40.389 --> 04:06:40.399 align:start position:0%
to sue the town to protect

their taxpayers
 
04:06:45.269 --> 04:06:45.279 align:start position:0%
a mediated settlement or court action
 
04:06:48.070 --> 04:06:48.080 align:start position:0%
could ultimately decide the issue
 
04:06:51.189 --> 04:06:51.199 align:start position:0%
if resolution is achieved
 
04:06:53.750 --> 04:06:53.760 align:start position:0%
any required enabling legislative action
 
04:06:55.670 --> 04:06:55.680 align:start position:0%

both the town

we are one community but unfortunately
 
04:08:47.030 --> 04:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
we are not all treated fairly or equally
 
04:08:49.189 --> 04:08:49.199 align:start position:0%
by the new hampshire legislature when it
 
04:08:50.950 --> 04:08:50.960 align:start position:0%
comes to our taxes
 
04:08:53.910 --> 04:08:53.920 align:start position:0%
taxation or how we spend it
 
04:08:56.229 --> 04:08:56.239 align:start position:0%
for a little history in 1990 there was a
 
04:08:58.710 --> 04:08:58.720 align:start position:0%
request for revision to the legislation
 
04:09:00.790 --> 04:09:00.800 align:start position:0%
for the distribution of highway funds to
 
04:09:02.710 --> 04:09:02.720 align:start position:0%
the woodsville fire district
 
04:09:04.710 --> 04:09:04.720 align:start position:0%
it is important to note that five of the
 
04:09:07.269 --> 04:09:07.279 align:start position:0%
six individuals making this request were
 
04:09:09.189 --> 04:09:09.199 align:start position:0%
residents of woodsville
 
04:09:12.070 --> 04:09:12.080 align:start position:0%
much the same happened in 2009 with
 
04:09:14.149 --> 04:09:14.159 align:start position:0%
another new legislatively mandated
 
04:09:16.309 --> 04:09:16.319 align:start position:0%
formula for the subsidization of
 
04:09:16.319 --> 04:09:17.670 align:start position:0%
formula for the subsidization of
woodsville

04:09:17.670 --> 04:09:17.680 align:start position:0%
woodsville
 
04:09:20.149 --> 04:09:20.159 align:start position:0%
on both occasions there was no town vote
 
04:09:22.389 --> 04:09:22.399 align:start position:0%
only a decision by elected inhabitants
 
04:09:23.990 --> 04:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
of woodsville
 
04:09:25.670 --> 04:09:25.680 align:start position:0%
four of the five members of the select
 
04:09:27.990 --> 04:09:28.000 align:start position:0%
board in 2009 were residents of
 
04:09:28.000 --> 04:09:29.429 align:start position:0%
board in 2009 were residents of
woodsville

04:09:29.429 --> 04:09:29.439 align:start position:0%
woodsville
 
04:09:31.269 --> 04:09:31.279 align:start position:0%
meaning most involved personally
 
04:09:33.750 --> 04:09:33.760 align:start position:0%
profited or benefited more than other
 
04:09:35.510 --> 04:09:35.520 align:start position:0%
citizens in haverhill
 
04:09:37.750 --> 04:09:37.760 align:start position:0%
as legislators i am sure you understand
 
04:09:40.630 --> 04:09:40.640 align:start position:0%
the ethics of such a situation
 
04:09:42.630 --> 04:09:42.640 align:start position:0%
almost two years ago the select board
 
04:09:44.469 --> 04:09:44.479 align:start position:0%
voted unanimously to pursue the
 
04:09:47.349 --> 04:09:47.359 align:start position:0%
statutory changes necessary to make our
 
04:09:50.070 --> 04:09:50.080 align:start position:0%
road maintenance fair and equitable
 
04:09:51.830 --> 04:09:51.840 align:start position:0%
discussions with the woodsville fire
 
04:09:53.510 --> 04:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
district were quickly negated by
 
04:09:55.429 --> 04:09:55.439 align:start position:0%
woodsville commissioners smiling and
 
04:09:58.309 --> 04:09:58.319 align:start position:0%
stating the formula is a law
 
04:10:00.550 --> 04:10:00.560 align:start position:0%
and the law is the law we cannot change
 
04:10:02.790 --> 04:10:02.800 align:start position:0%
it on the town level
 
04:10:05.030 --> 04:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
negotiations were not and are not
 
04:10:07.429 --> 04:10:07.439 align:start position:0%
possible with such comments as and i
 
04:10:07.439 --> 04:10:08.229 align:start position:0%
possible with such comments as and i

04:10:10.790 --> 04:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
no review of the process is needed nor
 
04:10:12.550 --> 04:10:12.560 align:start position:0%
will it be tolerated
 
04:10:16.070 --> 04:10:16.080 align:start position:0%
the state statute stands in the way
 
04:10:17.670 --> 04:10:17.680 align:start position:0%
since the first hearing held in the
 
04:10:20.790 --> 04:10:20.800 align:start position:0%
senate which passed the repeal 24-0 in
 
04:10:23.590 --> 04:10:23.600 align:start position:0%
2019 haverhill select board members have
 
04:10:27.189 --> 04:10:27.199 align:start position:0%
been threatened and made to feel unsafe
 
04:10:29.269 --> 04:10:29.279 align:start position:0%
town manager bridget cardling has been
 
04:10:33.269 --> 04:10:33.279 align:start position:0%

district and local control
 
04:11:03.030 --> 04:11:03.040 align:start position:0%
there are people who have and will

testify the state law mandating
 
04:11:07.830 --> 04:11:07.840 align:start position:0%
haverhill taxpayers give woodsville more

than 53 000 a mile for its eight miles
 
04:11:13.670 --> 04:11:13.680 align:start position:0%
of road is a local issue that needs to
 
04:11:15.590 --> 04:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
be settled locally
 
04:11:16.870 --> 04:11:16.880 align:start position:0%

only you can repeal the law requiring
 
04:11:22.950 --> 04:11:22.960 align:start position:0%
haverhill taxpayers to give their tax
 
04:11:24.790 --> 04:11:24.800 align:start position:0%
money by a legislative mandate to
 
04:11:24.800 --> 04:11:26.070 align:start position:0%
money by a legislative mandate to
woodsville

04:11:26.070 --> 04:11:26.080 align:start position:0%
woodsville
 
04:11:28.229 --> 04:11:28.239 align:start position:0%
the issue of roads and distribution of
 
04:11:30.309 --> 04:11:30.319 align:start position:0%
money has been a divisive issue for many
 
04:11:30.319 --> 04:11:31.830 align:start position:0%
money has been a divisive issue for many
years

04:11:31.830 --> 04:11:31.840 align:start position:0%
years
 
04:11:33.990 --> 04:11:34.000 align:start position:0%
woodsville which has eight miles of road
 
04:11:36.710 --> 04:11:36.720 align:start position:0%
to maintain is legislatively granted
 
04:11:39.590 --> 04:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
fifty one thousand dollars per mile
 
04:11:42.149 --> 04:11:42.159 align:start position:0%
the rest of payroll services 72 miles of
 
04:11:44.149 --> 04:11:44.159 align:start position:0%
road with ninety seven hundred dollars
 
04:11:47.110 --> 04:11:47.120 align:start position:0%
per mile left from the taxes raised
 
04:11:49.750 --> 04:11:49.760 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers can only afford so much
 
04:11:51.110 --> 04:11:51.120 align:start position:0%
and currently the new hampshire
 
04:11:53.030 --> 04:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
legislature is the only place the
 
04:11:55.670 --> 04:11:55.680 align:start position:0%
haverhill taxpayers can get released
 
04:11:58.309 --> 04:11:58.319 align:start position:0%
they are mandated to give woodsville
 
04:12:00.870 --> 04:12:00.880 align:start position:0%
their tax dollars
 
04:12:03.030 --> 04:12:03.040 align:start position:0%
until the issue became overwhelming and
 
04:12:05.349 --> 04:12:05.359 align:start position:0%
a new town manager was hired no one
 
04:12:07.349 --> 04:12:07.359 align:start position:0%
really knew what was happening
 
04:12:09.189 --> 04:12:09.199 align:start position:0%
a quick look at the books showed poor
 
04:12:11.429 --> 04:12:11.439 align:start position:0%
stewardship in a situation where
 
04:12:13.510 --> 04:12:13.520 align:start position:0%
woosville was overpaid the mandated
 
04:12:13.520 --> 04:12:14.950 align:start position:0%
woosville was overpaid the mandated
amount

04:12:14.950 --> 04:12:14.960 align:start position:0%
amount
 
04:12:18.950 --> 04:12:18.960 align:start position:0%
just the years 2016 17 18 and 19
 
04:12:20.630 --> 04:12:20.640 align:start position:0%
represent an overpayment by the
 
04:12:22.550 --> 04:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
taxpayers of haverhill to the precinct
 
04:12:26.630 --> 04:12:26.640 align:start position:0%
of woodsville of almost 800 000
 
04:12:29.110 --> 04:12:29.120 align:start position:0%
our solution which is before you today
 
04:12:31.750 --> 04:12:31.760 align:start position:0%
is every road mile equals status
 
04:12:33.830 --> 04:12:33.840 align:start position:0%
regardless of where it begins where it
 
04:12:36.790 --> 04:12:36.800 align:start position:0%
goes or how many deer or bear cross over
 
04:12:36.800 --> 04:12:37.990 align:start position:0%
goes or how many deer or bear cross over
them

04:12:37.990 --> 04:12:38.000 align:start position:0%
them
 
04:12:39.990 --> 04:12:40.000 align:start position:0%
it will end the legislative mandates
 
04:12:42.229 --> 04:12:42.239 align:start position:0%
upon the haverhill taxpayer and allow
 
04:12:45.670 --> 04:12:45.680 align:start position:0%
everyone to be treated as equals
 
04:12:47.990 --> 04:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
every precinct has the ability to create
 
04:12:50.630 --> 04:12:50.640 align:start position:0%
whatever services it wants so long as
 
04:12:53.510 --> 04:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
the want is paid for by a precinct tax
 
04:12:56.309 --> 04:12:56.319 align:start position:0%
and is in accordance with state law
 
04:12:58.870 --> 04:12:58.880 align:start position:0%
a water company electric company
 
04:13:01.030 --> 04:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
ambulance service or fire department if
 
04:13:03.030 --> 04:13:03.040 align:start position:0%
they want it they can have it and pay
 
04:13:04.229 --> 04:13:04.239 align:start position:0%
for it
 
04:13:06.710 --> 04:13:06.720 align:start position:0%
i am of the opinion that the existing
 
04:13:09.349 --> 04:13:09.359 align:start position:0%
law has allowed those responsible for
 
04:13:11.910 --> 04:13:11.920 align:start position:0%
the serious financial obligations that
 
04:13:14.229 --> 04:13:14.239 align:start position:0%
have been precipitated investigations by
 
04:13:16.870 --> 04:13:16.880 align:start position:0%
the dra and the attorney general to act
 
04:13:18.630 --> 04:13:18.640 align:start position:0%
with impunity
 
04:13:20.309 --> 04:13:20.319 align:start position:0%
they believe they can manipulate the
 
04:13:22.229 --> 04:13:22.239 align:start position:0%
legislature through a couple of elected
 
04:13:22.239 --> 04:13:24.149 align:start position:0%
legislature through a couple of elected
representatives

04:13:24.149 --> 04:13:24.159 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
04:13:26.630 --> 04:13:26.640 align:start position:0%
this is given the taxpayers a belief
 
04:13:28.790 --> 04:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
that if you have money you can even take
 
04:13:30.870 --> 04:13:30.880 align:start position:0%
more from the little guy the working
 
04:13:34.630 --> 04:13:34.640 align:start position:0%
family by having friends in concord
 
04:13:36.389 --> 04:13:36.399 align:start position:0%
it's time for equal treatment of all
 
04:13:38.630 --> 04:13:38.640 align:start position:0%
people of the town of haverhill
 
04:13:40.309 --> 04:13:40.319 align:start position:0%
please remove the mandate the
 
04:13:42.550 --> 04:13:42.560 align:start position:0%
legislature created which interferes in
 
04:13:45.189 --> 04:13:45.199 align:start position:0%
haverhill's right to govern itself
 
04:13:47.110 --> 04:13:47.120 align:start position:0%
please allow haverhill taxpayers the
 
04:13:50.229 --> 04:13:50.239 align:start position:0%
ability to control their own destiny
 
04:13:52.229 --> 04:13:52.239 align:start position:0%
please restore the faith people need to
 
04:13:54.790 --> 04:13:54.800 align:start position:0%
have in its government and most of all
 
04:13:57.590 --> 04:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
those elected to govern
 
04:13:59.269 --> 04:13:59.279 align:start position:0%
it is interesting to note that the
 
04:14:00.870 --> 04:14:00.880 align:start position:0%
attorney general has just found the
 
04:14:02.950 --> 04:14:02.960 align:start position:0%
woodsville fire district guilty on two
 
04:14:04.870 --> 04:14:04.880 align:start position:0%
counts of electioneering
 
04:14:06.550 --> 04:14:06.560 align:start position:0%
it is my understanding there are six
 
04:14:08.630 --> 04:14:08.640 align:start position:0%
more counts pending
 
04:14:10.870 --> 04:14:10.880 align:start position:0%
ironically this returns one of the
 
04:14:13.429 --> 04:14:13.439 align:start position:0%
woodsville residents michael graham
 
04:14:15.429 --> 04:14:15.439 align:start position:0%
who benefited and signed road
 
04:14:17.349 --> 04:14:17.359 align:start position:0%
legislation to the haverhill select
 
04:14:20.870 --> 04:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
board after a 20-year hiatus
 
04:14:23.189 --> 04:14:23.199 align:start position:0%
from using government mail paid for by
 
04:14:25.750 --> 04:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
taxpayers to having the police remove
 
04:14:28.550 --> 04:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
legal signs from private property this
 
04:14:30.870 --> 04:14:30.880 align:start position:0%
legislation and its profits to those in
 
04:14:33.750 --> 04:14:33.760 align:start position:0%
woodsville pushes the limits of criminal
 
04:14:33.760 --> 04:14:35.590 align:start position:0%
woodsville pushes the limits of criminal
activity

04:14:35.590 --> 04:14:35.600 align:start position:0%
activity
 
04:14:37.910 --> 04:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
the use of government mail
 
04:14:39.590 --> 04:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
has been brushed off by the state
 
04:14:42.149 --> 04:14:42.159 align:start position:0%
election officials because the lifetime
 
04:14:42.159 --> 04:14:45.910 align:start position:0%
election officials because the lifetime

04:14:47.269 --> 04:14:47.279 align:start position:0%
if we could
 
04:14:48.870 --> 04:14:48.880 align:start position:0%
focus on
 
04:14:51.910 --> 04:14:51.920 align:start position:0%
the bill and not allegations of other
 
04:14:54.149 --> 04:14:54.159 align:start position:0%
wrongdoing or other problems
 
04:14:57.429 --> 04:14:57.439 align:start position:0%
within the town of april as a whole
 
04:14:59.110 --> 04:14:59.120 align:start position:0%
i would appreciate it
 
04:15:00.630 --> 04:15:00.640 align:start position:0%
my apology sir
 
04:15:04.070 --> 04:15:04.080 align:start position:0%
i ask you sincerely to repeal the law
 
04:15:06.630 --> 04:15:06.640 align:start position:0%
mandating haverhill taxpayers subsidize
 
04:15:08.469 --> 04:15:08.479 align:start position:0%
the private enterprises of woodsville
 
04:15:08.479 --> 04:15:09.590 align:start position:0%
the private enterprises of woodsville
commissioners

04:15:09.590 --> 04:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
commissioners
 
04:15:11.830 --> 04:15:11.840 align:start position:0%
and allow all of haverhill taxpayers to
 
04:15:13.910 --> 04:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
act as one family
 
04:15:15.670 --> 04:15:15.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:15:19.030 --> 04:15:19.040 align:start position:0%
any any questions for members of the
 
04:15:20.870 --> 04:15:20.880 align:start position:0%
committee see none
 
04:15:23.510 --> 04:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony thank you
 
04:15:26.870 --> 04:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
for your time sir and we will hear from
 
04:15:29.990 --> 04:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
the honorable robert clay
 
04:15:32.710 --> 04:15:32.720 align:start position:0%
welcome back to the general court
 
04:15:36.389 --> 04:15:36.399 align:start position:0%
thank you sir i i miss it sort of
 
04:15:38.389 --> 04:15:38.399 align:start position:0%
not the zoom though
 
04:15:39.830 --> 04:15:39.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman members of the
 
04:15:41.990 --> 04:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
committee for the record i was a member
 
04:15:43.510 --> 04:15:43.520 align:start position:0%
of the legislature both the house and
 
04:15:47.670 --> 04:15:47.680 align:start position:0%
the senate i spent 14 years and i truly
 
04:15:49.510 --> 04:15:49.520 align:start position:0%
do understand
 
04:15:51.429 --> 04:15:51.439 align:start position:0%
what you give up to be a volunteer
 
04:15:54.469 --> 04:15:54.479 align:start position:0%
citizen legislator and i will say right
 
04:15:57.349 --> 04:15:57.359 align:start position:0%
now i would never support any other type
 
04:15:59.830 --> 04:15:59.840 align:start position:0%
of legislation legislature
 
04:16:01.429 --> 04:16:01.439 align:start position:0%
because i think this is the way things
 
04:16:02.870 --> 04:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
get done
 
04:16:06.070 --> 04:16:06.080 align:start position:0%
as to to senate bill 26 the reason why
 
04:16:08.550 --> 04:16:08.560 align:start position:0%
i'm even involved is a few years ago i
 
04:16:10.469 --> 04:16:10.479 align:start position:0%
just just for the record i like to
 
04:16:13.189 --> 04:16:13.199 align:start position:0%
restore historical structures
 
04:16:15.269 --> 04:16:15.279 align:start position:0%
so i was approached because a few
 
04:16:18.070 --> 04:16:18.080 align:start position:0%
historical structures were going to
 
04:16:19.750 --> 04:16:19.760 align:start position:0%
be either demolished or turned into
 
04:16:19.760 --> 04:16:20.950 align:start position:0%
be either demolished or turned into
apartments

04:16:20.950 --> 04:16:20.960 align:start position:0%
apartments
 
04:16:23.510 --> 04:16:23.520 align:start position:0%
and i agreed to buy them and fix them
 
04:16:26.070 --> 04:16:26.080 align:start position:0%
right now i have four
 
04:16:28.309 --> 04:16:28.319 align:start position:0%
two of them are under renovations and
 
04:16:30.950 --> 04:16:30.960 align:start position:0%
and two others are not yet
 
04:16:32.950 --> 04:16:32.960 align:start position:0%
but i i also
 
04:16:35.670 --> 04:16:35.680 align:start position:0%
somehow got involved politically
 
04:16:39.429 --> 04:16:39.439 align:start position:0%
and part of it was because the tax base
 
04:16:41.830 --> 04:16:41.840 align:start position:0%
um haverhill i think is the fifth
 
04:16:44.229 --> 04:16:44.239 align:start position:0%
highest taxed
 
04:16:46.630 --> 04:16:46.640 align:start position:0%
community in the state of new hampshire
 
04:16:49.189 --> 04:16:49.199 align:start position:0%
so i started looking at my appraisals in
 
04:16:51.830 --> 04:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
the appraisals of other important people
 
04:16:54.630 --> 04:16:54.640 align:start position:0%
and said okay something's not right
 
04:16:57.429 --> 04:16:57.439 align:start position:0%
so as we started looking up came
 
04:16:59.429 --> 04:16:59.439 align:start position:0%
the uh road money
 
04:17:01.269 --> 04:17:01.279 align:start position:0%
i remember they were buying a grader for
 
04:17:02.870 --> 04:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
a hundred thousand dollars and had to
 
04:17:05.189 --> 04:17:05.199 align:start position:0%
raise a hundred and thirty so that they
 
04:17:07.110 --> 04:17:07.120 align:start position:0%
could give woodsville thirty thousand
 
04:17:08.790 --> 04:17:08.800 align:start position:0%
dollars directly
 
04:17:10.630 --> 04:17:10.640 align:start position:0%
so we started looking at exactly what
 
04:17:13.510 --> 04:17:13.520 align:start position:0%
was happening but what we have
 
04:17:16.870 --> 04:17:16.880 align:start position:0%
is is a as a long-standing dispute and
 
04:17:19.189 --> 04:17:19.199 align:start position:0%
to to representative ebola
 
04:17:21.830 --> 04:17:21.840 align:start position:0%
this started in the late 1800s and
 
04:17:24.389 --> 04:17:24.399 align:start position:0%
there's actually a court case a supreme
 
04:17:26.630 --> 04:17:26.640 align:start position:0%
court case in the state of new hampshire
 
04:17:26.640 --> 04:17:27.309 align:start position:0%
court case in the state of new hampshire
from

04:17:27.309 --> 04:17:27.319 align:start position:0%
from
 
04:17:27.319 --> 04:17:28.950 align:start position:0%
from
1893

04:17:28.950 --> 04:17:28.960 align:start position:0%
1893
 
04:17:31.670 --> 04:17:31.680 align:start position:0%
and it just happened to discuss
 
04:17:33.990 --> 04:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
if if woodsville took care of its own
 
04:17:36.309 --> 04:17:36.319 align:start position:0%
roads who were responsible
 
04:17:38.149 --> 04:17:38.159 align:start position:0%
for any accidents or who have the
 
04:17:38.159 --> 04:17:39.510 align:start position:0%
for any accidents or who have the
liability

04:17:39.510 --> 04:17:39.520 align:start position:0%
liability
 
04:17:41.990 --> 04:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
and the court back then said haverhill
 
04:17:44.469 --> 04:17:44.479 align:start position:0%
holds the liability regardless of who
 
04:17:46.229 --> 04:17:46.239 align:start position:0%
actually does it because
 
04:17:48.309 --> 04:17:48.319 align:start position:0%
haverhill is the town that actually owns
 
04:17:50.309 --> 04:17:50.319 align:start position:0%
woodsville in a sense
 
04:17:52.550 --> 04:17:52.560 align:start position:0%
so and it's just gone on over and over
 
04:17:54.790 --> 04:17:54.800 align:start position:0%
again now the reason why there was a
 
04:17:57.510 --> 04:17:57.520 align:start position:0%
dispute is because in the late 1800s the
 
04:18:00.149 --> 04:18:00.159 align:start position:0%
railroad was making a decision
 
04:18:02.389 --> 04:18:02.399 align:start position:0%
originally haverhill corner was the
 
04:18:04.710 --> 04:18:04.720 align:start position:0%
center of the universe up there and
 
04:18:06.870 --> 04:18:06.880 align:start position:0%
that's where all the circuit courts met
 
04:18:08.790 --> 04:18:08.800 align:start position:0%
i think three months a year
 
04:18:10.630 --> 04:18:10.640 align:start position:0%
um every house in haverhill corner
 
04:18:13.910 --> 04:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
including the ones i own were either a
 
04:18:13.920 --> 04:18:14.950 align:start position:0%
including the ones i own were either a
tavern

04:18:14.950 --> 04:18:14.960 align:start position:0%
tavern
 
04:18:17.990 --> 04:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
a bed and breakfast or both during all
 
04:18:19.429 --> 04:18:19.439 align:start position:0%
those years because there was no place
 
04:18:21.110 --> 04:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
else for people to stay
 
04:18:23.189 --> 04:18:23.199 align:start position:0%
so what happened was that the railroad
 
04:18:25.510 --> 04:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
suddenly became the boss
 
04:18:27.590 --> 04:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
and if you look at all of the the
 
04:18:29.750 --> 04:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
history for the state of new hampshire
 
04:18:31.429 --> 04:18:31.439 align:start position:0%
you will find
 
04:18:34.309 --> 04:18:34.319 align:start position:0%
the railroad became too powerful
 
04:18:36.950 --> 04:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
controlled the legislature to the point
 
04:18:38.950 --> 04:18:38.960 align:start position:0%
where there was an actual
 
04:18:41.910 --> 04:18:41.920 align:start position:0%
serious fight to get the railroad out
 
04:18:45.830 --> 04:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:45.840 --> 04:18:47.269 align:start position:0%
 
allocated

04:18:47.269 --> 04:18:47.279 align:start position:0%
allocated
 
04:18:50.790 --> 04:18:50.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:53.269 --> 04:18:53.279 align:start position:0%
powerful influences
 
04:18:58.149 --> 04:18:58.159 align:start position:0%
but it brings us to 2009 in 2009
 
04:18:58.159 --> 04:18:59.110 align:start position:0%
but it brings us to 2009 in 2009
as

04:18:59.110 --> 04:18:59.120 align:start position:0%
as
 
04:19:01.349 --> 04:19:01.359 align:start position:0%
mr clarkson said
 
04:19:02.550 --> 04:19:02.560 align:start position:0%
there were
 
04:19:04.790 --> 04:19:04.800 align:start position:0%
four people who were selectmen
 
04:19:05.750 --> 04:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
that were
 
04:19:08.149 --> 04:19:08.159 align:start position:0%
members of woodsville and one who who
 
04:19:11.429 --> 04:19:11.439 align:start position:0%
belonged in haverhill corner
 
04:19:13.510 --> 04:19:13.520 align:start position:0%
who happened to be a state rep now when
 
04:19:15.910 --> 04:19:15.920 align:start position:0%
you hear the testimony earlier that said
 
04:19:15.920 --> 04:19:17.030 align:start position:0%
you hear the testimony earlier that said
that

04:19:17.030 --> 04:19:17.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:19:19.269 --> 04:19:19.279 align:start position:0%
the commissioners in woodsville approved
 
04:19:20.550 --> 04:19:20.560 align:start position:0%
this deal
 
04:19:23.269 --> 04:19:23.279 align:start position:0%
and the selectmen approved the deal well
 
04:19:24.870 --> 04:19:24.880 align:start position:0%
when you have
 
04:19:26.870 --> 04:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
we have eight people
 
04:19:28.630 --> 04:19:28.640 align:start position:0%
and seven of them are going to benefit
 
04:19:28.640 --> 04:19:30.149 align:start position:0%
and seven of them are going to benefit
financially

04:19:30.149 --> 04:19:30.159 align:start position:0%
financially
 
04:19:32.469 --> 04:19:32.479 align:start position:0%
it's pretty hard not to have eight
 
04:19:34.710 --> 04:19:34.720 align:start position:0%
people who are going to agree
 
04:19:38.710 --> 04:19:38.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:40.550 --> 04:19:40.560 align:start position:0%
people have said the law is the law and
 
04:19:42.469 --> 04:19:42.479 align:start position:0%
that's exactly what's happened
 
04:19:44.389 --> 04:19:44.399 align:start position:0%
in 2009
 
04:19:46.149 --> 04:19:46.159 align:start position:0%
um the representative and the state
 
04:19:46.159 --> 04:19:47.189 align:start position:0%
um the representative and the state
senator

04:19:47.189 --> 04:19:47.199 align:start position:0%
senator
 
04:19:49.510 --> 04:19:49.520 align:start position:0%
uh put this before and i found out from
 
04:19:51.189 --> 04:19:51.199 align:start position:0%
the representative
 
04:19:52.870 --> 04:19:52.880 align:start position:0%
on april 26
 
04:19:54.630 --> 04:19:54.640 align:start position:0%
that they had a hard time actually
 
04:19:57.429 --> 04:19:57.439 align:start position:0%
getting the bill from 2009 through
 
04:19:59.670 --> 04:19:59.680 align:start position:0%
the legislature didn't like it
 
04:20:01.750 --> 04:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
so they pulled a trick
 
04:20:03.269 --> 04:20:03.279 align:start position:0%
where you take it and you put it in
 
04:20:06.389 --> 04:20:06.399 align:start position:0%
house bill 2. i'm sure most of you uh
 
04:20:08.149 --> 04:20:08.159 align:start position:0%
understand that that
 
04:20:08.159 --> 04:20:09.269 align:start position:0%
understand that that
process

04:20:09.269 --> 04:20:09.279 align:start position:0%
process
 
04:20:11.349 --> 04:20:11.359 align:start position:0%
and that's how it came about
 
04:20:13.110 --> 04:20:13.120 align:start position:0%
because it it was
 
04:20:13.120 --> 04:20:14.229 align:start position:0%
because it it was
then

04:20:14.229 --> 04:20:14.239 align:start position:0%
then
 
04:20:16.149 --> 04:20:16.159 align:start position:0%
looked at as hey wait a minute i'm not
 
04:20:18.309 --> 04:20:18.319 align:start position:0%
sure this is fair
 
04:20:21.510 --> 04:20:21.520 align:start position:0%
so anyways it became law
 
04:20:22.469 --> 04:20:22.479 align:start position:0%
and then
 
04:20:23.990 --> 04:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
the more they looked at it they looked
 
04:20:26.630 --> 04:20:26.640 align:start position:0%
and said as you heard from jennifer
 
04:20:29.189 --> 04:20:29.199 align:start position:0%
in 2018 or 19
 
04:20:30.550 --> 04:20:30.560 align:start position:0%
they found that they were making
 
04:20:30.560 --> 04:20:31.990 align:start position:0%
they found that they were making
overpayments

04:20:31.990 --> 04:20:32.000 align:start position:0%
overpayments
 
04:20:34.229 --> 04:20:34.239 align:start position:0%
and a previous
 
04:20:34.239 --> 04:20:35.349 align:start position:0%
and a previous
manager

04:20:35.349 --> 04:20:35.359 align:start position:0%
manager
 
04:20:37.349 --> 04:20:37.359 align:start position:0%
actually had admitted that yes he knew
 
04:20:40.550 --> 04:20:40.560 align:start position:0%
he was overpaying woodsville but he felt
 
04:20:42.550 --> 04:20:42.560 align:start position:0%
that they deserved it but he also lives
 
04:20:43.750 --> 04:20:43.760 align:start position:0%
in woodsville
 
04:20:46.550 --> 04:20:46.560 align:start position:0%
um and and so you know we go on and on
 
04:20:47.510 --> 04:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
and on
 
04:20:49.830 --> 04:20:49.840 align:start position:0%
it's been very difficult to sit with
 
04:20:49.840 --> 04:20:50.630 align:start position:0%
it's been very difficult to sit with
them

04:20:50.630 --> 04:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
them
 
04:20:53.269 --> 04:20:53.279 align:start position:0%
and yes i've been with senator geider
 
04:20:55.670 --> 04:20:55.680 align:start position:0%
and and and rick glad in the beginning
 
04:20:57.269 --> 04:20:57.279 align:start position:0%
and we looked at it and said how do we
 
04:20:58.389 --> 04:20:58.399 align:start position:0%
fix it
 
04:21:01.429 --> 04:21:01.439 align:start position:0%
well i i don't blame woodsville
 
04:21:03.429 --> 04:21:03.439 align:start position:0%
they smile and say
 
04:21:05.349 --> 04:21:05.359 align:start position:0%
there's nothing to fix
 
04:21:07.349 --> 04:21:07.359 align:start position:0%
we get almost half a million dollars a
 
04:21:10.070 --> 04:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
year because the legislature says we do
 
04:21:11.670 --> 04:21:11.680 align:start position:0%
so what is there to talk about there's
 
04:21:14.389 --> 04:21:14.399 align:start position:0%
no reason to talk to you
 
04:21:16.309 --> 04:21:16.319 align:start position:0%
and that's why we have to hit
 
04:21:18.790 --> 04:21:18.800 align:start position:0%
representative rick ladd said in 2019
 
04:21:20.790 --> 04:21:20.800 align:start position:0%
when the bill that this was in was a big
 
04:21:22.469 --> 04:21:22.479 align:start position:0%
omnibus bill and it was vetoed by the
 
04:21:23.990 --> 04:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
governor because there was too much in
 
04:21:24.000 --> 04:21:25.349 align:start position:0%
governor because there was too much in
it

04:21:25.349 --> 04:21:25.359 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:21:28.630 --> 04:21:28.640 align:start position:0%
he said it's it's it's none of concord's
 
04:21:31.830 --> 04:21:31.840 align:start position:0%
business concord needs to get its nose
 
04:21:33.910 --> 04:21:33.920 align:start position:0%
out of haverhill's business
 
04:21:35.990 --> 04:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
and i agree with what he said but i
 
04:21:38.870 --> 04:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
don't think he agrees with why
 
04:21:41.349 --> 04:21:41.359 align:start position:0%
i agree that conker should take its nose
 
04:21:43.349 --> 04:21:43.359 align:start position:0%
out of haverhill's business
 
04:21:45.750 --> 04:21:45.760 align:start position:0%
why does concord think it's okay for
 
04:21:47.030 --> 04:21:47.040 align:start position:0%
them to say
 
04:21:49.510 --> 04:21:49.520 align:start position:0%
haverhill gets this much money
 
04:21:51.429 --> 04:21:51.439 align:start position:0%
and out of that money
 
04:21:53.429 --> 04:21:53.439 align:start position:0%
they have to give this much to one
 
04:21:53.439 --> 04:21:55.349 align:start position:0%
they have to give this much to one
precinct

04:21:55.349 --> 04:21:55.359 align:start position:0%
precinct
 
04:21:57.910 --> 04:21:57.920 align:start position:0%
now the precinct
 
04:21:59.670 --> 04:21:59.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't need the money they said well
 
04:22:01.349 --> 04:22:01.359 align:start position:0%
they do because they want all the tax
 
04:22:03.910 --> 04:22:03.920 align:start position:0%
money but when you look at it all of
 
04:22:05.750 --> 04:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
haverhill including them
 
04:22:07.750 --> 04:22:07.760 align:start position:0%
use all the roads
 
04:22:07.760 --> 04:22:08.630 align:start position:0%
use all the roads
so

04:22:08.630 --> 04:22:08.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:22:10.790 --> 04:22:10.800 align:start position:0%
haverhill says we use woodsville roads
 
04:22:12.309 --> 04:22:12.319 align:start position:0%
you use havel roads we all use
 
04:22:14.149 --> 04:22:14.159 align:start position:0%
everybody's roads together
 
04:22:16.630 --> 04:22:16.640 align:start position:0%
so why are we paying together
 
04:22:19.510 --> 04:22:19.520 align:start position:0%
and what woodsville's return return is
 
04:22:22.229 --> 04:22:22.239 align:start position:0%
it doesn't matter what you use we take
 
04:22:24.070 --> 04:22:24.080 align:start position:0%
care of our roads
 
04:22:26.469 --> 04:22:26.479 align:start position:0%
and we'll take all of our money well you
 
04:22:28.870 --> 04:22:28.880 align:start position:0%
know it's 420 000
 
04:22:30.630 --> 04:22:30.640 align:start position:0%
a year
 
04:22:33.269 --> 04:22:33.279 align:start position:0%
that we can't afford i'm a taxpayer so
 
04:22:35.910 --> 04:22:35.920 align:start position:0%
i'm speaking as a taxpayer now
 
04:22:37.750 --> 04:22:37.760 align:start position:0%
we can't keep doing this
 
04:22:37.760 --> 04:22:39.590 align:start position:0%
we can't keep doing this
now

04:22:39.590 --> 04:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:22:41.429 --> 04:22:41.439 align:start position:0%
there's a second part of this bill that
 
04:22:44.070 --> 04:22:44.080 align:start position:0%
i'm surprised nobody's talked about
 
04:22:47.189 --> 04:22:47.199 align:start position:0%
and it's the audits and the audits are
 
04:22:49.510 --> 04:22:49.520 align:start position:0%
tied closely
 
04:22:51.990 --> 04:22:52.000 align:start position:0%
to to the road money which is why they
 
04:22:53.910 --> 04:22:53.920 align:start position:0%
dra asked to put their
 
04:22:55.750 --> 04:22:55.760 align:start position:0%
piece in
 
04:22:59.429 --> 04:22:59.439 align:start position:0%
the audits show the misuse of road money
 
04:23:00.790 --> 04:23:00.800 align:start position:0%
some of you have been on the committee
 
04:23:02.389 --> 04:23:02.399 align:start position:0%
long enough to know that federal and
 
04:23:04.790 --> 04:23:04.800 align:start position:0%
state money comes with caveats there are
 
04:23:06.469 --> 04:23:06.479 align:start position:0%
certain things you can and can't do with
 
04:23:06.479 --> 04:23:07.750 align:start position:0%
certain things you can and can't do with
it

04:23:07.750 --> 04:23:07.760 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:23:09.830 --> 04:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
but how many of you know
 
04:23:13.030 --> 04:23:13.040 align:start position:0%
that in 2009
 
04:23:17.349 --> 04:23:17.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:19.189 --> 04:23:19.199 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to see where it was
 
04:23:22.389 --> 04:23:22.399 align:start position:0%
the the the the statement was made
 
04:23:23.750 --> 04:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
this will provide
 
04:23:25.590 --> 04:23:25.600 align:start position:0%
woodville precinct
 
04:23:27.910 --> 04:23:27.920 align:start position:0%
with an another hundred thousand dollars
 
04:23:29.990 --> 04:23:30.000 align:start position:0%
which will help in maintaining
 
04:23:32.389 --> 04:23:32.399 align:start position:0%
the sewer system water
 
04:23:32.399 --> 04:23:34.229 align:start position:0%
the sewer system water
sidewalks

04:23:34.229 --> 04:23:34.239 align:start position:0%
sidewalks
 
04:23:37.269 --> 04:23:37.279 align:start position:0%
problem is is all of those are privately
 
04:23:39.670 --> 04:23:39.680 align:start position:0%
owned enterprise systems
 
04:23:41.510 --> 04:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
not entitled
 
04:23:44.149 --> 04:23:44.159 align:start position:0%
to taxpayer money and not entitled
 
04:23:46.070 --> 04:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
to road money road money is supposed to
 
04:23:48.149 --> 04:23:48.159 align:start position:0%
be used for roads it's not supposed to
 
04:23:50.469 --> 04:23:50.479 align:start position:0%
be used to repair the water system
 
04:23:52.389 --> 04:23:52.399 align:start position:0%
especially when it's a for-profit
 
04:23:52.399 --> 04:23:53.990 align:start position:0%
especially when it's a for-profit
business

04:23:53.990 --> 04:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
business
 
04:23:56.550 --> 04:23:56.560 align:start position:0%
so when they started asking
 
04:23:59.349 --> 04:23:59.359 align:start position:0%
for audits out of woodsville
 
04:24:02.070 --> 04:24:02.080 align:start position:0%
the town manager of haverhill
 
04:24:03.990 --> 04:24:04.000 align:start position:0%
said the dra oh don't worry about it's a
 
04:24:05.510 --> 04:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
bunch of good old boys they just don't
 
04:24:07.189 --> 04:24:07.199 align:start position:0%
understand but we know everything is
 
04:24:07.199 --> 04:24:10.070 align:start position:0%
understand but we know everything is
okay

04:24:10.070 --> 04:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:24:12.149 --> 04:24:12.159 align:start position:0%
as he left
 
04:24:14.309 --> 04:24:14.319 align:start position:0%
certain things came up
 
04:24:17.189 --> 04:24:17.199 align:start position:0%
and dra said we need the help of the
 
04:24:19.510 --> 04:24:19.520 align:start position:0%
legislature because we need to do this
 
04:24:19.520 --> 04:24:20.630 align:start position:0%
legislature because we need to do this
audit

04:24:20.630 --> 04:24:20.640 align:start position:0%
audit
 
04:24:20.640 --> 04:24:22.630 align:start position:0%
audit
now

04:24:22.630 --> 04:24:22.640 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:24:24.469 --> 04:24:24.479 align:start position:0%
they've done the audit because the ag
 
04:24:27.030 --> 04:24:27.040 align:start position:0%
has stepped in and dra has stepped in
 
04:24:29.590 --> 04:24:29.600 align:start position:0%
and and i have um
 
04:24:30.950 --> 04:24:30.960 align:start position:0%
looked at it
 
04:24:33.349 --> 04:24:33.359 align:start position:0%
they have some
 
04:24:33.359 --> 04:24:34.710 align:start position:0%
they have some
serious

04:24:34.710 --> 04:24:34.720 align:start position:0%
serious
 
04:24:37.269 --> 04:24:37.279 align:start position:0%
uh issues one that bothers me the most
 
04:24:38.469 --> 04:24:38.479 align:start position:0%
having been on the new hampshire
 
04:24:40.630 --> 04:24:40.640 align:start position:0%
retirement system
 
04:24:41.590 --> 04:24:41.600 align:start position:0%
on the board when i was in the
 
04:24:41.600 --> 04:24:43.590 align:start position:0%
on the board when i was in the
legislature

04:24:43.590 --> 04:24:43.600 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
04:24:45.510 --> 04:24:45.520 align:start position:0%
11 years
 
04:24:47.189 --> 04:24:47.199 align:start position:0%
of having an employee they called
 
04:24:47.199 --> 04:24:49.030 align:start position:0%
of having an employee they called
part-time

04:24:49.030 --> 04:24:49.040 align:start position:0%
part-time
 
04:24:51.429 --> 04:24:51.439 align:start position:0%
and i guess he was collecting
 
04:24:53.670 --> 04:24:53.680 align:start position:0%
but he um
 
04:24:55.510 --> 04:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
they were calling him part-time and then
 
04:24:57.110 --> 04:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
paying him something that was called
 
04:24:58.630 --> 04:24:58.640 align:start position:0%
calm time basically they were paying the
 
04:25:01.269 --> 04:25:01.279 align:start position:0%
gentleman ninety dollars an hour
 
04:25:03.110 --> 04:25:03.120 align:start position:0%
in telling the retirement system that he
 
04:25:05.110 --> 04:25:05.120 align:start position:0%
was just getting a pittance these are
 
04:25:06.469 --> 04:25:06.479 align:start position:0%
the things that we're finding in the
 
04:25:06.479 --> 04:25:07.349 align:start position:0%
the things that we're finding in the
audit

04:25:07.349 --> 04:25:07.359 align:start position:0%
audit
 
04:25:09.910 --> 04:25:09.920 align:start position:0%
the electric company is another one
 
04:25:12.950 --> 04:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
it's supposed to be a municipally owned
 
04:25:12.960 --> 04:25:14.550 align:start position:0%
it's supposed to be a municipally owned
enterprise

04:25:14.550 --> 04:25:14.560 align:start position:0%
enterprise
 
04:25:16.149 --> 04:25:16.159 align:start position:0%
yet it sells
 
04:25:18.550 --> 04:25:18.560 align:start position:0%
electricity across state line which
 
04:25:20.550 --> 04:25:20.560 align:start position:0%
makes it federal
 
04:25:22.710 --> 04:25:22.720 align:start position:0%
the puc is under the impression in the
 
04:25:24.630 --> 04:25:24.640 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire that because it's
 
04:25:26.870 --> 04:25:26.880 align:start position:0%
municipally owned and it only services
 
04:25:26.880 --> 04:25:28.070 align:start position:0%
municipally owned and it only services
itself

04:25:28.070 --> 04:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
itself
 
04:25:29.990 --> 04:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
it can't regulate it
 
04:25:32.469 --> 04:25:32.479 align:start position:0%
and the the answer to the federal is we
 
04:25:34.950 --> 04:25:34.960 align:start position:0%
don't sell anything across state lines
 
04:25:36.950 --> 04:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
well they do
 
04:25:39.189 --> 04:25:39.199 align:start position:0%
and and where's the money
 
04:25:41.750 --> 04:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
i was part of a team
 
04:25:43.510 --> 04:25:43.520 align:start position:0%
that was um
 
04:25:45.750 --> 04:25:45.760 align:start position:0%
hired by someone to go in and look for
 
04:25:46.870 --> 04:25:46.880 align:start position:0%
the money
 
04:25:48.950 --> 04:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
i've sat with dick guy
 
04:25:51.429 --> 04:25:51.439 align:start position:0%
i've asked for the information
 
04:25:53.510 --> 04:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
um i was told he doesn't have it i was
 
04:25:55.670 --> 04:25:55.680 align:start position:0%
taken to the superintendent
 
04:25:57.590 --> 04:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
and the superintendent turned white we
 
04:25:58.790 --> 04:25:58.800 align:start position:0%
thought he was gonna have a heart attack
 
04:26:00.389 --> 04:26:00.399 align:start position:0%
and said i don't have the books only
 
04:26:03.110 --> 04:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
dick guy does so i'm not making any
 
04:26:04.710 --> 04:26:04.720 align:start position:0%
accusations i'm only telling you what's
 
04:26:06.149 --> 04:26:06.159 align:start position:0%
in the audits what i've experienced
 
04:26:06.159 --> 04:26:07.429 align:start position:0%
in the audits what i've experienced
myself

04:26:07.429 --> 04:26:07.439 align:start position:0%
myself
 
04:26:09.510 --> 04:26:09.520 align:start position:0%
part two of this bill
 
04:26:11.670 --> 04:26:11.680 align:start position:0%
is just as important
 
04:26:13.429 --> 04:26:13.439 align:start position:0%
as part one
 
04:26:16.710 --> 04:26:16.720 align:start position:0%
part one says to the legislature
 
04:26:19.269 --> 04:26:19.279 align:start position:0%
kind of get out of our business
 
04:26:21.510 --> 04:26:21.520 align:start position:0%
eight miles of road is nothing for
 
04:26:23.429 --> 04:26:23.439 align:start position:0%
haverhill to take over
 
04:26:25.030 --> 04:26:25.040 align:start position:0%
and i will tell you that
 
04:26:27.349 --> 04:26:27.359 align:start position:0%
the the fight
 
04:26:30.389 --> 04:26:30.399 align:start position:0%
in haverhill during the last election
 
04:26:32.630 --> 04:26:32.640 align:start position:0%
was to make sure that the
 
04:26:32.640 --> 04:26:33.830 align:start position:0%
was to make sure that the
greater

04:26:33.830 --> 04:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
greater
 
04:26:36.389 --> 04:26:36.399 align:start position:0%
and the dump truck that was necessary to
 
04:26:38.469 --> 04:26:38.479 align:start position:0%
to work the roads
 
04:26:41.189 --> 04:26:41.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:44.309 --> 04:26:44.319 align:start position:0%
they couldn't keep the lease contract so
 
04:26:46.790 --> 04:26:46.800 align:start position:0%
they did something that basically
 
04:26:46.800 --> 04:26:48.229 align:start position:0%
they did something that basically
defunded

04:26:48.229 --> 04:26:48.239 align:start position:0%
defunded
 
04:26:51.990 --> 04:26:52.000 align:start position:0%
but to the managers the town manager's
 
04:26:52.000 --> 04:26:53.349 align:start position:0%
but to the managers the town manager's
credit

04:26:53.349 --> 04:26:53.359 align:start position:0%
credit
 
04:26:55.349 --> 04:26:55.359 align:start position:0%
she found another way to make sure that
 
04:26:57.030 --> 04:26:57.040 align:start position:0%
she kept the equipment to keep the roads
 
04:27:00.309 --> 04:27:00.319 align:start position:0%
going so what we have is we have
 
04:27:02.630 --> 04:27:02.640 align:start position:0%
a big fight
 
04:27:04.630 --> 04:27:04.640 align:start position:0%
you're not going to fix the fight over
 
04:27:06.389 --> 04:27:06.399 align:start position:0%
the roads unless the
 
04:27:08.229 --> 04:27:08.239 align:start position:0%
legislature says
 
04:27:11.590 --> 04:27:11.600 align:start position:0%
it's not our business it's your business
 
04:27:13.910 --> 04:27:13.920 align:start position:0%
and then i guarantee you
 
04:27:15.429 --> 04:27:15.439 align:start position:0%
there's a group of people who want to
 
04:27:16.950 --> 04:27:16.960 align:start position:0%
sit down
 
04:27:19.110 --> 04:27:19.120 align:start position:0%
and work it out
 
04:27:21.750 --> 04:27:21.760 align:start position:0%
but woodsville is not going to get 420
 
04:27:24.070 --> 04:27:24.080 align:start position:0%
000 a year because
 
04:27:26.389 --> 04:27:26.399 align:start position:0%
the town of haverhill in its different
 
04:27:26.399 --> 04:27:27.750 align:start position:0%
the town of haverhill in its different
precincts

04:27:27.750 --> 04:27:27.760 align:start position:0%
precincts
 
04:27:29.830 --> 04:27:29.840 align:start position:0%
if you're making money off the water and
 
04:27:31.189 --> 04:27:31.199 align:start position:0%
you're making money off of selling
 
04:27:32.950 --> 04:27:32.960 align:start position:0%
electricity and you're making money off
 
04:27:35.670 --> 04:27:35.680 align:start position:0%
of selling the sewer use
 
04:27:38.070 --> 04:27:38.080 align:start position:0%
then then you shouldn't be taking our
 
04:27:41.030 --> 04:27:41.040 align:start position:0%
money to maintain them
 
04:27:43.590 --> 04:27:43.600 align:start position:0%
you should be using your money the money
 
04:27:47.269 --> 04:27:47.279 align:start position:0%
you make off of selling that product
 
04:27:48.630 --> 04:27:48.640 align:start position:0%
and that's what we're asking we're
 
04:27:49.910 --> 04:27:49.920 align:start position:0%
asking you
 
04:27:54.950 --> 04:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
to take concord out of the road money
 
04:27:58.870 --> 04:27:58.880 align:start position:0%
and i'm asking you to
 
04:28:01.110 --> 04:28:01.120 align:start position:0%
make sure that dra
 
04:28:03.510 --> 04:28:03.520 align:start position:0%
can finish its audit work and it's not
 
04:28:05.429 --> 04:28:05.439 align:start position:0%
just woodsville
 
04:28:07.189 --> 04:28:07.199 align:start position:0%
that would have to follow this audit
 
04:28:09.830 --> 04:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
process it's everyone it's time that
 
04:28:09.840 --> 04:28:11.429 align:start position:0%
process it's everyone it's time that
taxpayers

04:28:11.429 --> 04:28:11.439 align:start position:0%
taxpayers
 
04:28:13.269 --> 04:28:13.279 align:start position:0%
had the ability
 
04:28:16.389 --> 04:28:16.399 align:start position:0%
to see exactly what it is people do with
 
04:28:19.110 --> 04:28:19.120 align:start position:0%
the money that's raised and appropriated
 
04:28:20.950 --> 04:28:20.960 align:start position:0%
i can tell you
 
04:28:23.189 --> 04:28:23.199 align:start position:0%
that one investigator i know has been on
 
04:28:26.149 --> 04:28:26.159 align:start position:0%
this since 2009 on the electric
 
04:28:28.550 --> 04:28:28.560 align:start position:0%
they still can't find out
 
04:28:29.990 --> 04:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
where the money goes
 
04:28:31.590 --> 04:28:31.600 align:start position:0%
they're they're getting close because
 
04:28:34.389 --> 04:28:34.399 align:start position:0%
dra is forcing the audit
 
04:28:36.550 --> 04:28:36.560 align:start position:0%
and and um there's a lot of things
 
04:28:37.990 --> 04:28:38.000 align:start position:0%
happening a lot of people trying to
 
04:28:38.000 --> 04:28:39.110 align:start position:0%
happening a lot of people trying to
cover

04:28:39.110 --> 04:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
cover
 
04:28:41.349 --> 04:28:41.359 align:start position:0%
but but the reality is
 
04:28:44.149 --> 04:28:44.159 align:start position:0%
the people in in haverhill as a town all
 
04:28:45.830 --> 04:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
five precincts
 
04:28:47.910 --> 04:28:47.920 align:start position:0%
a good hard-working
 
04:28:47.920 --> 04:28:48.790 align:start position:0%
a good hard-working
people

04:28:48.790 --> 04:28:48.800 align:start position:0%
people
 
04:28:51.030 --> 04:28:51.040 align:start position:0%
they're working families
 
04:28:52.790 --> 04:28:52.800 align:start position:0%
and they're trying to keep their head
 
04:28:54.870 --> 04:28:54.880 align:start position:0%
above water
 
04:28:57.349 --> 04:28:57.359 align:start position:0%
being number five
 
04:29:00.389 --> 04:29:00.399 align:start position:0%
in taxes in the state of new hampshire
 
04:29:02.710 --> 04:29:02.720 align:start position:0%
these are simple people there's not a
 
04:29:05.349 --> 04:29:05.359 align:start position:0%
lot of luxuries there
 
04:29:07.110 --> 04:29:07.120 align:start position:0%
and it's not fair
 
04:29:09.269 --> 04:29:09.279 align:start position:0%
the only fair thing is for the state of
 
04:29:12.309 --> 04:29:12.319 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's legislature to say
 
04:29:14.630 --> 04:29:14.640 align:start position:0%
this is your problem we're repealing the
 
04:29:17.349 --> 04:29:17.359 align:start position:0%
mandate that you give them this money
 
04:29:19.750 --> 04:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
and you pass the second set
 
04:29:21.750 --> 04:29:21.760 align:start position:0%
so that the people in woodsville is
 
04:29:23.429 --> 04:29:23.439 align:start position:0%
whether the people as well as the people
 
04:29:24.469 --> 04:29:24.479 align:start position:0%
in haverhill
 
04:29:24.479 --> 04:29:25.670 align:start position:0%
in haverhill
know

04:29:25.670 --> 04:29:25.680 align:start position:0%
know
 
04:29:28.309 --> 04:29:28.319 align:start position:0%
what actually happened to all the money
 
04:29:30.870 --> 04:29:30.880 align:start position:0%
they've been fun fun funneling into that
 
04:29:30.880 --> 04:29:32.469 align:start position:0%
they've been fun fun funneling into that
division

04:29:32.469 --> 04:29:32.479 align:start position:0%
division
 
04:29:35.030 --> 04:29:35.040 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i'm going to
 
04:29:37.990 --> 04:29:38.000 align:start position:0%
send in my original testimony
 
04:29:40.309 --> 04:29:40.319 align:start position:0%
i wanted to make sure that
 
04:29:42.070 --> 04:29:42.080 align:start position:0%
i answered some of the questions i hope
 
04:29:42.950 --> 04:29:42.960 align:start position:0%
i did
 
04:29:45.510 --> 04:29:45.520 align:start position:0%
i'd be more than happy to answer more
 
04:29:47.750 --> 04:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
i've been around a long time as some of
 
04:29:49.750 --> 04:29:49.760 align:start position:0%
you know i've been a selectman i've been
 
04:29:51.670 --> 04:29:51.680 align:start position:0%
a budget committee member
 
04:29:53.429 --> 04:29:53.439 align:start position:0%
i was a member of the house for eight
 
04:29:56.229 --> 04:29:56.239 align:start position:0%
years i was a member of the senate
 
04:29:58.309 --> 04:29:58.319 align:start position:0%
and that drove me out
 
04:29:58.319 --> 04:29:59.590 align:start position:0%
and that drove me out
but

04:29:59.590 --> 04:29:59.600 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:30:02.710 --> 04:30:02.720 align:start position:0%
i i i fully understand
 
04:30:02.720 --> 04:30:04.469 align:start position:0%
i i i fully understand
um

04:30:04.469 --> 04:30:04.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:30:08.309 --> 04:30:08.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:10.550 --> 04:30:10.560 align:start position:0%
go on
 
04:30:12.950 --> 04:30:12.960 align:start position:0%
go ahead and finish
 
04:30:15.910 --> 04:30:15.920 align:start position:0%

i i have a place up there that i'm
 
04:30:24.149 --> 04:30:24.159 align:start position:0%
probably going to retire
 
04:30:26.229 --> 04:30:26.239 align:start position:0%
i um
 
04:30:27.830 --> 04:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
it's it's a beautiful it's a beautiful
 
04:30:27.840 --> 04:30:28.950 align:start position:0%
it's it's a beautiful it's a beautiful
community

04:30:28.950 --> 04:30:28.960 align:start position:0%
community
 
04:30:30.710 --> 04:30:30.720 align:start position:0%
but what's been happening to it over the
 
04:30:32.790 --> 04:30:32.800 align:start position:0%
years just isn't right and and it's
 
04:30:32.800 --> 04:30:34.070 align:start position:0%
years just isn't right and and it's
because

04:30:34.070 --> 04:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:30:36.950 --> 04:30:36.960 align:start position:0%
uh people in haverhill are old-fashioned
 
04:30:36.960 --> 04:30:37.830 align:start position:0%
uh people in haverhill are old-fashioned
um

04:30:37.830 --> 04:30:37.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:30:39.429 --> 04:30:39.439 align:start position:0%
new hampshirites
 
04:30:40.830 --> 04:30:40.840 align:start position:0%
and they believe that
 
04:30:43.910 --> 04:30:43.920 align:start position:0%
everybody is trustworthy and sometimes
 
04:30:45.670 --> 04:30:45.680 align:start position:0%
that's not the case
 
04:30:48.149 --> 04:30:48.159 align:start position:0%
representative you got a question
 
04:30:51.990 --> 04:30:52.000 align:start position:0%
yes thank you and thank you uh mr clegg
 
04:30:54.309 --> 04:30:54.319 align:start position:0%
for the history lesson it just really
 
04:30:57.429 --> 04:30:57.439 align:start position:0%
helps put some things in context so
 
04:31:00.070 --> 04:31:00.080 align:start position:0%
if i um may see a seem like a small
 
04:31:01.910 --> 04:31:01.920 align:start position:0%
point considering everything else you
 
04:31:04.710 --> 04:31:04.720 align:start position:0%
testify to but if i understand what you
 
04:31:06.309 --> 04:31:06.319 align:start position:0%
just said
 
04:31:08.389 --> 04:31:08.399 align:start position:0%
there really wasn't a lot in this
 
04:31:12.870 --> 04:31:12.880 align:start position:0%
statute about funding until 2009
 
04:31:15.830 --> 04:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
and when that and and that was
 
04:31:19.189 --> 04:31:19.199 align:start position:0%
introduced i understand as part of hb2
 
04:31:21.189 --> 04:31:21.199 align:start position:0%
and that's because at that point there
 
04:31:23.750 --> 04:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
was already vast disagreement
 
04:31:25.750 --> 04:31:25.760 align:start position:0%
going on
 
04:31:27.750 --> 04:31:27.760 align:start position:0%
let me let me just say that there was
 
04:31:30.070 --> 04:31:30.080 align:start position:0%
there was a formula in there but it was
 
04:31:32.950 --> 04:31:32.960 align:start position:0%
nowhere near this and what it said was
 
04:31:32.960 --> 04:31:34.149 align:start position:0%
nowhere near this and what it said was
that

04:31:34.149 --> 04:31:34.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:31:37.429 --> 04:31:37.439 align:start position:0%
haverhill had to give woodsville up to a
 
04:31:39.990 --> 04:31:40.000 align:start position:0%
certain amount of money which meant that
 
04:31:41.590 --> 04:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
if haver was spending nine thousand
 
04:31:44.229 --> 04:31:44.239 align:start position:0%
dollars a mile on its own roads
 
04:31:46.070 --> 04:31:46.080 align:start position:0%
it had to give nine thousand dollars a
 
04:31:48.870 --> 04:31:48.880 align:start position:0%
mile for the other eight eight miles but
 
04:31:50.870 --> 04:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
it also said that should some kind of
 
04:31:53.750 --> 04:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
catastrophe happen in in woodsville that
 
04:31:55.830 --> 04:31:55.840 align:start position:0%
haverhill would would would continue to
 
04:31:59.670 --> 04:31:59.680 align:start position:0%
be part of thing it wasn't until 2009
 
04:32:01.830 --> 04:32:01.840 align:start position:0%
that greed took over
 
04:32:06.870 --> 04:32:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:09.110 --> 04:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
see no further question oh
 
04:32:11.030 --> 04:32:11.040 align:start position:0%
representative thank you very much mr
 
04:32:12.389 --> 04:32:12.399 align:start position:0%
chairman uh
 
04:32:14.229 --> 04:32:14.239 align:start position:0%
representative former senator former
 
04:32:16.309 --> 04:32:16.319 align:start position:0%
senator representative clay i have a
 
04:32:18.070 --> 04:32:18.080 align:start position:0%
question you talked about this plot that
 
04:32:20.469 --> 04:32:20.479 align:start position:0%
i maybe i'm missing something
 
04:32:24.630 --> 04:32:24.640 align:start position:0%
is this audit been completed
 
04:32:28.070 --> 04:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
um it's a it's five years of audits um
 
04:32:30.790 --> 04:32:30.800 align:start position:0%
the first two years are are done we're
 
04:32:32.950 --> 04:32:32.960 align:start position:0%
in 2017.
 
04:32:32.960 --> 04:32:33.750 align:start position:0%
in 2017.
um

04:32:33.750 --> 04:32:33.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:32:35.429 --> 04:32:35.439 align:start position:0%
i've looked at them the first two were
 
04:32:39.429 --> 04:32:39.439 align:start position:0%
pretty bad the 2017 isn't good
 
04:32:41.670 --> 04:32:41.680 align:start position:0%
but um the rest of the other two years
 
04:32:43.189 --> 04:32:43.199 align:start position:0%
are not done yet
 
04:32:43.199 --> 04:32:43.990 align:start position:0%
are not done yet
okay

04:32:43.990 --> 04:32:44.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:32:45.110 --> 04:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
04:32:52.550 --> 04:32:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:54.149 --> 04:32:54.159 align:start position:0%
i have to be careful with some of the
 
04:32:56.630 --> 04:32:56.640 align:start position:0%
information i would strongly suggest
 
04:32:58.550 --> 04:32:58.560 align:start position:0%
that you get with senator geider and
 
04:33:01.269 --> 04:33:01.279 align:start position:0%
speak to the the gentleman at dra that's
 
04:33:03.269 --> 04:33:03.279 align:start position:0%
in charge of this
 
04:33:05.349 --> 04:33:05.359 align:start position:0%
as legislators you can get more
 
04:33:07.189 --> 04:33:07.199 align:start position:0%
information okay thank you very much
 
04:33:09.029 --> 04:33:09.039 align:start position:0%
appreciate it thank you
 
04:33:10.310 --> 04:33:10.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:33:10.320 --> 04:33:13.349 align:start position:0%
thank you
representative

04:33:13.349 --> 04:33:13.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:17.510 --> 04:33:17.520 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for taking my question
 
04:33:21.510 --> 04:33:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:25.349 --> 04:33:25.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:27.990 --> 04:33:28.000 align:start position:0%
it it solves the problem because it
 
04:33:30.949 --> 04:33:30.959 align:start position:0%
allows people to sit down
 
04:33:32.230 --> 04:33:32.240 align:start position:0%
and and
 
04:33:34.470 --> 04:33:34.480 align:start position:0%
as i said with all due respect if i was
 
04:33:36.789 --> 04:33:36.799 align:start position:0%
part of woodsville and i was getting 420
 
04:33:36.799 --> 04:33:37.830 align:start position:0%
part of woodsville and i was getting 420
000

04:33:37.830 --> 04:33:37.840 align:start position:0%
000
 
04:33:40.551 --> 04:33:40.561 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't sit and negotiate it away
 
04:33:42.390 --> 04:33:42.400 align:start position:0%
but if it's gone i would sit there and
 
04:33:45.910 --> 04:33:45.920 align:start position:0%
negotiate how best to care for the roads
 
04:33:48.310 --> 04:33:48.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:33:51.670 --> 04:33:51.680 align:start position:0%
see no further questions
 
04:33:52.789 --> 04:33:52.799 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:33:54.470 --> 04:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
thank you sir
 
04:33:54.480 --> 04:33:56.150 align:start position:0%
thank you sir
um

04:33:56.150 --> 04:33:56.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:33:59.109 --> 04:33:59.119 align:start position:0%
mr stephen wheeler
 
04:34:01.670 --> 04:34:01.680 align:start position:0%
yes can you hear me yes
 
04:34:04.709 --> 04:34:04.719 align:start position:0%
yes well first comment would be that
 
04:34:07.750 --> 04:34:07.760 align:start position:0%
the audits are done all the way to 2017
 
04:34:10.551 --> 04:34:10.561 align:start position:0%
and 18 and 19 are almost done and there
 
04:34:12.750 --> 04:34:12.760 align:start position:0%
is no money missing there's been no
 
04:34:15.269 --> 04:34:15.279 align:start position:0%
misappropriation of money the money that
 
04:34:17.750 --> 04:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
comes in to the precinct
 
04:34:19.670 --> 04:34:19.680 align:start position:0%
for water and light is completely
 
04:34:21.109 --> 04:34:21.119 align:start position:0%
different than when it comes into the
 
04:34:23.029 --> 04:34:23.039 align:start position:0%
precinct for roads in them because water
 
04:34:24.070 --> 04:34:24.080 align:start position:0%
and light
 
04:34:26.629 --> 04:34:26.639 align:start position:0%
and the sewer system and the ambulance
 
04:34:29.349 --> 04:34:29.359 align:start position:0%
systems are all enterprise systems so
 
04:34:30.709 --> 04:34:30.719 align:start position:0%
that money has nothing to do with
 
04:34:32.150 --> 04:34:32.160 align:start position:0%
woodsville roads
 
04:34:33.990 --> 04:34:34.000 align:start position:0%
and i've heard the figure of five
 
04:34:35.990 --> 04:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand four hundred thousand
 
04:34:38.310 --> 04:34:38.320 align:start position:0%
four hundred and twenty five thousand we
 
04:34:40.949 --> 04:34:40.959 align:start position:0%
only get what is a do us for the money i
 
04:34:44.629 --> 04:34:44.639 align:start position:0%
am a precinct commissioner we get 23.6
 
04:34:47.990 --> 04:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
of the road money because 23.6 of the
 
04:34:49.670 --> 04:34:49.680 align:start position:0%
tax dollars are paid by the people of
 
04:34:49.680 --> 04:34:50.789 align:start position:0%
tax dollars are paid by the people of
woodsville

04:34:50.789 --> 04:34:50.799 align:start position:0%
woodsville
 
04:34:52.470 --> 04:34:52.480 align:start position:0%
they would like it until we didn't get
 
04:34:55.189 --> 04:34:55.199 align:start position:0%
any of the money but that is a fallacy
 
04:34:56.310 --> 04:34:56.320 align:start position:0%
and there's a lot of other things that
 
04:34:57.830 --> 04:34:57.840 align:start position:0%
fallacies are what they're spoken about
 
04:35:00.390 --> 04:35:00.400 align:start position:0%
by the gentleman in front of me first of
 
04:35:04.310 --> 04:35:04.320 align:start position:0%
all the woodsville road started in 1898.
 
04:35:06.470 --> 04:35:06.480 align:start position:0%
this was due to because of the railroads
 
04:35:08.709 --> 04:35:08.719 align:start position:0%
as he mentioned and the city of
 
04:35:10.551 --> 04:35:10.561 align:start position:0%
woodsville which is not a city but it's
 
04:35:13.029 --> 04:35:13.039 align:start position:0%
a town was built like a city because we
 
04:35:15.750 --> 04:35:15.760 align:start position:0%
had to have a sewer system and storm
 
04:35:17.750 --> 04:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
drains because water doesn't run down
 
04:35:19.029 --> 04:35:19.039 align:start position:0%
the streets too well and that when
 
04:35:22.150 --> 04:35:22.160 align:start position:0%
they're tired woodsville had to crew 30
 
04:35:25.670 --> 04:35:25.680 align:start position:0%
years before the town had a road crew
 
04:35:27.109 --> 04:35:27.119 align:start position:0%
woods built maintenance agreements have
 
04:35:29.109 --> 04:35:29.119 align:start position:0%
been modified many times over all these
 
04:35:31.590 --> 04:35:31.600 align:start position:0%
years and the valuation has grown
 
04:35:33.910 --> 04:35:33.920 align:start position:0%
this is based on property evaluations
 
04:35:36.629 --> 04:35:36.639 align:start position:0%
assessing a tax assessments
 
04:35:39.429 --> 04:35:39.439 align:start position:0%
the last update was held in 2008 which
 
04:35:41.590 --> 04:35:41.600 align:start position:0%
took effect in 2009
 
04:35:43.510 --> 04:35:43.520 align:start position:0%
that last agreement has worked fine
 
04:35:45.670 --> 04:35:45.680 align:start position:0%
until 2019
 
04:35:47.429 --> 04:35:47.439 align:start position:0%
at that time the border select one of
 
04:35:48.869 --> 04:35:48.879 align:start position:0%
the advisement of the town manager
 
04:35:51.029 --> 04:35:51.039 align:start position:0%
changed the formula without the precinct
 
04:35:53.750 --> 04:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
of woodville having any input
 
04:35:55.269 --> 04:35:55.279 align:start position:0%
when they have a memorandum of
 
04:35:56.709 --> 04:35:56.719 align:start position:0%
understanding you have to have all
 
04:35:59.349 --> 04:35:59.359 align:start position:0%
parties involved in the changing of an
 
04:35:59.359 --> 04:36:01.670 align:start position:0%
parties involved in the changing of an
agreement

04:36:01.670 --> 04:36:01.680 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
04:36:03.189 --> 04:36:03.199 align:start position:0%
it appears the spikeboard the town
 
04:36:05.109 --> 04:36:05.119 align:start position:0%
managers do not understand the full
 
04:36:06.709 --> 04:36:06.719 align:start position:0%
understanding of that formula and what
 
04:36:09.269 --> 04:36:09.279 align:start position:0%
it was agreed to in 2008 because the
 
04:36:10.949 --> 04:36:10.959 align:start position:0%
lack of understanding the precinct of
 
04:36:12.310 --> 04:36:12.320 align:start position:0%
woodsville has not received their
 
04:36:14.551 --> 04:36:14.561 align:start position:0%
portion of the taxes collected to apply
 
04:36:16.390 --> 04:36:16.400 align:start position:0%
the road means this year at all we're
 
04:36:17.750 --> 04:36:17.760 align:start position:0%
supposed to get it every quarter we
 
04:36:20.709 --> 04:36:20.719 align:start position:0%
haven't got a cent yet
 
04:36:22.869 --> 04:36:22.879 align:start position:0%
and he talked about the
 
04:36:25.830 --> 04:36:25.840 align:start position:0%
the select board actually in 2008 there
 
04:36:27.990 --> 04:36:28.000 align:start position:0%
was only four members on the select
 
04:36:29.990 --> 04:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
board because one that resigned when
 
04:36:31.990 --> 04:36:32.000 align:start position:0%
this was done and they didn't not
 
04:36:34.789 --> 04:36:34.799 align:start position:0%
replace that person until august and
 
04:36:36.150 --> 04:36:36.160 align:start position:0%
this this
 
04:36:38.390 --> 04:36:38.400 align:start position:0%
the agreement was signed in april and
 
04:36:39.990 --> 04:36:40.000 align:start position:0%
two were from haverhill and two were
 
04:36:42.150 --> 04:36:42.160 align:start position:0%
from woodsville but they're all elected
 
04:36:44.629 --> 04:36:44.639 align:start position:0%
by the town people of the town of hagel
 
04:36:48.470 --> 04:36:48.480 align:start position:0%
so it's not a lopsided board as he said
 
04:36:50.629 --> 04:36:50.639 align:start position:0%
and i know that for a fact because in
 
04:36:52.869 --> 04:36:52.879 align:start position:0%
august my wife came back on to serve her
 
04:36:54.629 --> 04:36:54.639 align:start position:0%
11th year on the select board at that
 
04:36:56.310 --> 04:36:56.320 align:start position:0%
year she had been a selectman all those
 
04:36:59.349 --> 04:36:59.359 align:start position:0%
years so i know that for a fact
 
04:37:00.949 --> 04:37:00.959 align:start position:0%
the woodsville precinct commissioners
 
04:37:02.390 --> 04:37:02.400 align:start position:0%
have tried to arrange a meeting with the
 
04:37:02.400 --> 04:37:03.429 align:start position:0%
have tried to arrange a meeting with the
hebrew

04:37:03.429 --> 04:37:03.439 align:start position:0%
hebrew
 
04:37:05.990 --> 04:37:06.000 align:start position:0%
cable uh select board
 
04:37:08.070 --> 04:37:08.080 align:start position:0%
many times and they refuse to meet with
 
04:37:09.830 --> 04:37:09.840 align:start position:0%
us they said they couldn't meet until
 
04:37:12.551 --> 04:37:12.561 align:start position:0%
the lawsuit was over well
 
04:37:14.869 --> 04:37:14.879 align:start position:0%
we have a we have a copy from their
 
04:37:17.269 --> 04:37:17.279 align:start position:0%
lawyer and our lawyer that said that we
 
04:37:19.429 --> 04:37:19.439 align:start position:0%
should meet because before we can even
 
04:37:21.990 --> 04:37:22.000 align:start position:0%
go to court there has to be a mediation
 
04:37:24.551 --> 04:37:24.561 align:start position:0%
agreement between the two so i don't
 
04:37:25.990 --> 04:37:26.000 align:start position:0%
know where it is but
 
04:37:28.629 --> 04:37:28.639 align:start position:0%
and when one of the select board members
 
04:37:30.789 --> 04:37:30.799 align:start position:0%
asked to tell manager about this letter
 
04:37:32.470 --> 04:37:32.480 align:start position:0%
in this email she said i've never heard
 
04:37:34.470 --> 04:37:34.480 align:start position:0%
of it well five minutes before that
 
04:37:35.990 --> 04:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
selectmen got to her office the next
 
04:37:37.429 --> 04:37:37.439 align:start position:0%
morning she put on i guess i
 
04:37:39.109 --> 04:37:39.119 align:start position:0%
misunderstood what they were talking
 
04:37:39.119 --> 04:37:40.070 align:start position:0%
misunderstood what they were talking
about

04:37:40.070 --> 04:37:40.080 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:37:42.150 --> 04:37:42.160 align:start position:0%
i mean it's just been the same thing all
 
04:37:43.269 --> 04:37:43.279 align:start position:0%
the time
 
04:37:46.070 --> 04:37:46.080 align:start position:0%
uh 23.6 percent of the road money comes
 
04:37:47.830 --> 04:37:47.840 align:start position:0%
back to woodsboro because 23 percent of
 
04:37:49.750 --> 04:37:49.760 align:start position:0%
the road money is paid by the precinct
 
04:37:51.269 --> 04:37:51.279 align:start position:0%
of woodsville i don't know why we
 
04:37:53.590 --> 04:37:53.600 align:start position:0%
shouldn't get the money back that we've
 
04:37:55.830 --> 04:37:55.840 align:start position:0%
that was to us because our taxpayers
 
04:37:58.310 --> 04:37:58.320 align:start position:0%
have be double taxation again
 
04:38:00.150 --> 04:38:00.160 align:start position:0%
and they also get in double tax stations
 
04:38:01.551 --> 04:38:01.561 align:start position:0%
on the fire department which we give
 
04:38:03.910 --> 04:38:03.920 align:start position:0%
23.6 percent of the money to the town
 
04:38:05.750 --> 04:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
fire department and we don't get a sent
 
04:38:06.789 --> 04:38:06.799 align:start position:0%
back when we have our own fire
 
04:38:06.799 --> 04:38:08.830 align:start position:0%
back when we have our own fire
department

04:38:08.830 --> 04:38:08.840 align:start position:0%
department
 
04:38:12.629 --> 04:38:12.639 align:start position:0%
um and it just keeps going in the police
 
04:38:14.629 --> 04:38:14.639 align:start position:0%
call they said that 75 percent of the
 
04:38:17.990 --> 04:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
police calls well i contacted the
 
04:38:19.670 --> 04:38:19.680 align:start position:0%
dispatch because all about dispatch goes
 
04:38:20.949 --> 04:38:20.959 align:start position:0%
through grafton county sheriff's
 
04:38:20.959 --> 04:38:21.990 align:start position:0%
through grafton county sheriff's
department

04:38:21.990 --> 04:38:22.000 align:start position:0%
department
 
04:38:25.990 --> 04:38:26.000 align:start position:0%
and in the in the last ensuing year 31.6
 
04:38:28.310 --> 04:38:28.320 align:start position:0%
of the police cars were in woodsville
 
04:38:30.189 --> 04:38:30.199 align:start position:0%
at not 75
 
04:38:30.199 --> 04:38:31.990 align:start position:0%
at not 75
31.6

04:38:31.990 --> 04:38:32.000 align:start position:0%
31.6
 
04:38:34.230 --> 04:38:34.240 align:start position:0%
was it was down in woodsville and most
 
04:38:35.910 --> 04:38:35.920 align:start position:0%
of those were to walmart which we kind
 
04:38:35.920 --> 04:38:37.830 align:start position:0%
of those were to walmart which we kind
of

04:38:37.830 --> 04:38:37.840 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:38:39.830 --> 04:38:39.840 align:start position:0%
so i mean
 
04:38:41.429 --> 04:38:41.439 align:start position:0%
the people in woodsville
 
04:38:43.590 --> 04:38:43.600 align:start position:0%
we had our annual meeting uh two weeks
 
04:38:45.830 --> 04:38:45.840 align:start position:0%
after the towns
 
04:38:47.990 --> 04:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
after the tell meeting and the voters in
 
04:38:49.429 --> 04:38:49.439 align:start position:0%
woodsville at the annual meeting for the
 
04:38:51.429 --> 04:38:51.439 align:start position:0%
precinct of woodsville the sentiment for
 
04:38:53.029 --> 04:38:53.039 align:start position:0%
woodsville was to secede from the town
 
04:38:54.310 --> 04:38:54.320 align:start position:0%
of haverhill
 
04:38:56.150 --> 04:38:56.160 align:start position:0%
over the years woodsonville is often
 
04:38:58.470 --> 04:38:58.480 align:start position:0%
perceived as a separate town as many
 
04:39:00.310 --> 04:39:00.320 align:start position:0%
visitors to woodsville believe that
 
04:39:02.150 --> 04:39:02.160 align:start position:0%
they're in charge lawyers come up to the
 
04:39:03.429 --> 04:39:03.439 align:start position:0%
courthouse and they think woodsville is
 
04:39:05.349 --> 04:39:05.359 align:start position:0%
its own town they come to woodsville we
 
04:39:07.029 --> 04:39:07.039 align:start position:0%
have all the restaurants we have all the
 
04:39:09.109 --> 04:39:09.119 align:start position:0%
stores we have all the businesses in
 
04:39:11.429 --> 04:39:11.439 align:start position:0%
woodsville for that stuff and the town's
 
04:39:13.429 --> 04:39:13.439 align:start position:0%
complaining about tax money well all the
 
04:39:15.429 --> 04:39:15.439 align:start position:0%
rooms and meals tax which is almost 200
 
04:39:17.670 --> 04:39:17.680 align:start position:0%
000 a year goes to the town we don't
 
04:39:19.830 --> 04:39:19.840 align:start position:0%
receive a cent of it back and we have
 
04:39:21.189 --> 04:39:21.199 align:start position:0%
all the businesses i don't know what the
 
04:39:24.150 --> 04:39:24.160 align:start position:0%
hell the problem is there i just get i
 
04:39:25.590 --> 04:39:25.600 align:start position:0%
just get sick of hearing all this stuff
 
04:39:28.070 --> 04:39:28.080 align:start position:0%
all the time our road crew has to be
 
04:39:28.080 --> 04:39:29.109 align:start position:0%
all the time our road crew has to be
trained

04:39:29.109 --> 04:39:29.119 align:start position:0%
trained
 
04:39:30.949 --> 04:39:30.959 align:start position:0%
because they do storm drains they have
 
04:39:32.789 --> 04:39:32.799 align:start position:0%
to be trained to go under the road with
 
04:39:34.070 --> 04:39:34.080 align:start position:0%
their gas mask
 
04:39:35.109 --> 04:39:35.119 align:start position:0%
and everything when they go under the
 
04:39:37.270 --> 04:39:37.280 align:start position:0%
road to fix a storm drain or a suitable
 
04:39:39.910 --> 04:39:39.920 align:start position:0%
a road crew does fix the sewer grains
 
04:39:41.270 --> 04:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
but and the money that goes to
 
04:39:42.708 --> 04:39:42.718 align:start position:0%
woodsville precinct
 
04:39:44.868 --> 04:39:44.878 align:start position:0%
um comes the woodland precinct water
 
04:39:47.110 --> 04:39:47.120 align:start position:0%
lights its own entity i don't know how
 
04:39:48.948 --> 04:39:48.958 align:start position:0%
he figured dick guy was going to because
 
04:39:50.390 --> 04:39:50.400 align:start position:0%
he was a precinct commissioner was going
 
04:39:51.830 --> 04:39:51.840 align:start position:0%
to give him books
 
04:39:53.910 --> 04:39:53.920 align:start position:0%
for the water and light department when
 
04:39:55.670 --> 04:39:55.680 align:start position:0%
we went a separate entity until last
 
04:39:59.270 --> 04:39:59.280 align:start position:0%
year at town meeting our annual visit
 
04:40:01.990 --> 04:40:02.000 align:start position:0%
village meeting when they said oh we're
 
04:40:04.150 --> 04:40:04.160 align:start position:0%
going to join forces we had not been
 
04:40:06.070 --> 04:40:06.080 align:start position:0%
joined forces until the night since the
 
04:40:07.910 --> 04:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
1920s when louisville water and white
 
04:40:09.910 --> 04:40:09.920 align:start position:0%
was established so i don't know where we
 
04:40:11.590 --> 04:40:11.600 align:start position:0%
would have got that information from
 
04:40:12.628 --> 04:40:12.638 align:start position:0%
i've been
 
04:40:14.230 --> 04:40:14.240 align:start position:0%
i've been a commissioner for over six
 
04:40:16.470 --> 04:40:16.480 align:start position:0%
years now and i can tell you there's not
 
04:40:18.868 --> 04:40:18.878 align:start position:0%
one cent missing and the audit that just
 
04:40:20.788 --> 04:40:20.798 align:start position:0%
came out there's not one cent missing
 
04:40:22.868 --> 04:40:22.878 align:start position:0%
from woodsville yes we were calm with
 
04:40:24.390 --> 04:40:24.400 align:start position:0%
layman we didn't have a manager at the
 
04:40:26.390 --> 04:40:26.400 align:start position:0%
time we may not have done everything
 
04:40:28.390 --> 04:40:28.400 align:start position:0%
right but there's no money that went
 
04:40:30.550 --> 04:40:30.560 align:start position:0%
from water and light from the precinct
 
04:40:32.390 --> 04:40:32.400 align:start position:0%
to water and light because the two did
 
04:40:33.910 --> 04:40:33.920 align:start position:0%
not get along
 
04:40:35.910 --> 04:40:35.920 align:start position:0%
and the problem was the guy taking the
 
04:40:38.708 --> 04:40:38.718 align:start position:0%
money that was retired had nothing to do
 
04:40:40.628 --> 04:40:40.638 align:start position:0%
with the woodsville road crew because we
 
04:40:42.708 --> 04:40:42.718 align:start position:0%
had no control over the woodsville water
 
04:40:43.990 --> 04:40:44.000 align:start position:0%
and light department they were their own
 
04:40:45.510 --> 04:40:45.520 align:start position:0%
separate entity
 
04:40:47.510 --> 04:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
i just i just get sick of hearing well
 
04:40:49.110 --> 04:40:49.120 align:start position:0%
what's bill's just what feels that
 
04:40:51.590 --> 04:40:51.600 align:start position:0%
there's no money missing we just and
 
04:40:53.910 --> 04:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
senator geider was up there when they
 
04:40:56.948 --> 04:40:56.958 align:start position:0%

as you know there's been an agreement in
 
04:42:55.270 --> 04:42:55.280 align:start position:0%
place between the town of haverhill and
 
04:42:56.788 --> 04:42:56.798 align:start position:0%
woodsville on returning monies to

woodsville for highways since 1990.
 
04:43:03.030 --> 04:43:03.040 align:start position:0%
this has been amicably amended twice
 
04:43:05.510 --> 04:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
since being created
 
04:43:07.270 --> 04:43:07.280 align:start position:0%
with the purpose of sparing woodsville
 
04:43:09.030 --> 04:43:09.040 align:start position:0%
precinct residents and businesses the
 
04:43:10.390 --> 04:43:10.400 align:start position:0%

its own since the late 1880s
 
04:43:19.190 --> 04:43:19.200 align:start position:0%
there has been there has been and is a
 
04:43:20.708 --> 04:43:20.718 align:start position:0%
disagreement on the funding of road
 
04:43:23.030 --> 04:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
monies between the two parties this is a
 
04:43:25.430 --> 04:43:25.440 align:start position:0%
local issue and should not be resolved
 
04:43:28.628 --> 04:43:28.638 align:start position:0%
with all due respect in concord
 
04:43:30.310 --> 04:43:30.320 align:start position:0%
the woodsville precinct commissioners
 
04:43:32.150 --> 04:43:32.160 align:start position:0%
voted formally at their last meeting
 
04:43:34.150 --> 04:43:34.160 align:start position:0%
that they were opposed to this bill
 
04:43:36.070 --> 04:43:36.080 align:start position:0%
and i know as you've heard today that
 
04:43:38.310 --> 04:43:38.320 align:start position:0%
there's two two of the five select board
 
04:43:42.230 --> 04:43:42.240 align:start position:0%
members are in opposition of it as well
 
04:43:44.230 --> 04:43:44.240 align:start position:0%
through the precincts attorney
 
04:43:45.990 --> 04:43:46.000 align:start position:0%
they've reached out to the town to have
 
04:43:47.910 --> 04:43:47.920 align:start position:0%
a meeting on road funding
 
04:43:50.150 --> 04:43:50.160 align:start position:0%
um and this really needs time to play
 
04:43:54.070 --> 04:43:54.080 align:start position:0%
out they they need to get together
 
04:43:56.948 --> 04:43:56.958 align:start position:0%
the second part of the bill
 
04:43:59.510 --> 04:43:59.520 align:start position:0%
as amended is not relevant
 
04:44:01.910 --> 04:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
woodsville fire district is fully
 
04:44:03.990 --> 04:44:04.000 align:start position:0%
complying with having the necessary
 
04:44:06.150 --> 04:44:06.160 align:start position:0%
audits they're being conducted by
 
04:44:08.390 --> 04:44:08.400 align:start position:0%
plaudzik and sanderson
 
04:44:10.550 --> 04:44:10.560 align:start position:0%
uh three years are completed i know that
 
04:44:12.230 --> 04:44:12.240 align:start position:0%
was an earlier question
 
04:44:15.830 --> 04:44:15.840 align:start position:0%
and 2018 and 19 are near completion
 
04:44:18.868 --> 04:44:18.878 align:start position:0%
we have also as a district contracted
 
04:44:21.430 --> 04:44:21.440 align:start position:0%
with project for 2020
 
04:44:23.830 --> 04:44:23.840 align:start position:0%
that work will begin as soon as 19 is
 
04:44:23.840 --> 04:44:24.628 align:start position:0%
that work will begin as soon as 19 is
done

04:44:24.628 --> 04:44:24.638 align:start position:0%
done
 
04:44:26.948 --> 04:44:26.958 align:start position:0%
and i hope that 20 is completed
 
04:44:34.708 --> 04:44:34.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:38.230 --> 04:44:38.240 align:start position:0%
i would argue that the language
 
04:44:40.390 --> 04:44:40.400 align:start position:0%
at the end of this should not be tied to
 
04:44:42.708 --> 04:44:42.718 align:start position:0%
any bill as it's an add-on
 
04:44:44.150 --> 04:44:44.160 align:start position:0%
and should apply to all towns and
 
04:44:46.628 --> 04:44:46.638 align:start position:0%
districts equally throughout the state
 
04:44:50.948 --> 04:44:50.958 align:start position:0%
and should not single out one community
 
04:44:50.958 --> 04:44:51.750 align:start position:0%
and should not single out one community
um

04:44:51.750 --> 04:44:51.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:44:51.760 --> 04:44:52.868 align:start position:0%
um

04:48:28.788 --> 04:48:28.798 align:start position:0%
road system in woodsville i did have the
 
04:48:31.590 --> 04:48:31.600 align:start position:0%
same question and i asked uh benoit
 
04:48:34.230 --> 04:48:34.240 align:start position:0%
pelletier who works in the office
 
04:48:37.270 --> 04:48:37.280 align:start position:0%
of legislative research here and he gave
 
04:48:40.550 --> 04:48:40.560 align:start position:0%
me a report about a year ago and the
 
04:48:45.190 --> 04:48:45.200 align:start position:0%
first issue that appears is in 1877.
 
04:48:50.150 --> 04:48:50.160 align:start position:0%
then it goes 1887 1893 1899 a year after
 
04:48:52.110 --> 04:48:52.120 align:start position:0%
the spanish-american war
 
04:48:55.110 --> 04:48:55.120 align:start position:0%
1913 and then we get up to the years
 
04:48:56.628 --> 04:48:56.638 align:start position:0%
that we're more involved with and i'd
 
04:48:58.948 --> 04:48:58.958 align:start position:0%
like to speak to that just very quickly
 
04:49:00.470 --> 04:49:00.480 align:start position:0%
and briefly
 
04:49:04.230 --> 04:49:04.240 align:start position:0%
in 1990 representative paul lamont
 
04:49:05.910 --> 04:49:05.920 align:start position:0%
put forward a bill
 
04:49:09.350 --> 04:49:09.360 align:start position:0%
it was hb 1138 which dealt with the
 
04:49:12.628 --> 04:49:12.638 align:start position:0%
woodsville road system and how monies
 
04:49:15.110 --> 04:49:15.120 align:start position:0%
that were paid by woodsville folks and
 
04:49:17.430 --> 04:49:17.440 align:start position:0%
haverhill folks for the highway budget
 
04:49:19.030 --> 04:49:19.040 align:start position:0%
up to 20
 
04:49:21.910 --> 04:49:21.920 align:start position:0%
would be used to support the system in
 
04:49:25.750 --> 04:49:25.760 align:start position:0%
woodsville so it went back to 1990.
 
04:49:29.910 --> 04:49:29.920 align:start position:0%
then sb 75 came about in 2009
 
04:49:31.910 --> 04:49:31.920 align:start position:0%
that was put forth when i was asked the
 
04:49:33.430 --> 04:49:33.440 align:start position:0%
selectmen up there and chairing the
 
04:49:35.750 --> 04:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
select board at the time but i also want
 
04:49:37.750 --> 04:49:37.760 align:start position:0%
to mention to you that the other
 
04:49:39.910 --> 04:49:39.920 align:start position:0%
individuals that co-sponsored this bill
 
04:49:41.670 --> 04:49:41.680 align:start position:0%
and sponsored this bill
 
04:49:43.270 --> 04:49:43.280 align:start position:0%
was senator
 
04:49:45.990 --> 04:49:46.000 align:start position:0%
deb reynolds out of plymouth whom i know
 
04:49:49.030 --> 04:49:49.040 align:start position:0%
well and represented paul ingerbritson
 
04:49:51.350 --> 04:49:51.360 align:start position:0%
who comes from pike one of the areas
 
04:49:54.470 --> 04:49:54.480 align:start position:0%
within haverhill which is not part of
 
04:49:57.830 --> 04:49:57.840 align:start position:0%
woodsville there are districts within
 
04:50:00.628 --> 04:50:00.638 align:start position:0%
haverhill that have their own boards for
 
04:50:03.510 --> 04:50:03.520 align:start position:0%
various tasks be it water be it fire be
 
04:50:05.910 --> 04:50:05.920 align:start position:0%
it planting haverhill corner where i
 
04:50:07.510 --> 04:50:07.520 align:start position:0%
live currently
 
04:50:10.628 --> 04:50:10.638 align:start position:0%
and then you have north haverhill pike
 
04:50:13.510 --> 04:50:13.520 align:start position:0%
and you have mountain lakes is and
 
04:50:13.520 --> 04:50:15.510 align:start position:0%
and you have mountain lakes is and
woodsville

04:50:15.510 --> 04:50:15.520 align:start position:0%
woodsville
 
04:50:16.948 --> 04:50:16.958 align:start position:0%
north haverhill haverhill corner
 
04:50:20.070 --> 04:50:20.080 align:start position:0%
mountain lakes are primarily residential
 
04:50:20.080 --> 04:50:21.190 align:start position:0%
mountain lakes are primarily residential
oriented

04:50:21.190 --> 04:50:21.200 align:start position:0%
oriented
 
04:50:23.350 --> 04:50:23.360 align:start position:0%
our revenues and our income especially
 
04:50:25.670 --> 04:50:25.680 align:start position:0%
if you look at meals and rooming rooms
 
04:50:28.708 --> 04:50:28.718 align:start position:0%
income tax that stuff it all comes out
 
04:50:30.628 --> 04:50:30.638 align:start position:0%
of woodsville
 
04:50:34.150 --> 04:50:34.160 align:start position:0%
and so um there are also some uh uh
 
04:50:35.990 --> 04:50:36.000 align:start position:0%
bills in the past which we should be
 
04:50:40.868 --> 04:50:40.878 align:start position:0%
aware of before we get to 4 414 hb414
 
04:50:44.390 --> 04:50:44.400 align:start position:0%
or to the uh omnibus bill we had last
 
04:50:46.230 --> 04:50:46.240 align:start position:0%
year we've had memorandum of
 
04:50:48.470 --> 04:50:48.480 align:start position:0%
understanding signed by both the
 
04:50:51.350 --> 04:50:51.360 align:start position:0%
commissioners in woodsville and the
 
04:50:54.670 --> 04:50:54.680 align:start position:0%
select board dating back to 1990
 
04:50:58.150 --> 04:50:58.160 align:start position:0%
1995 and then there was a proposal to
 
04:51:00.868 --> 04:51:00.878 align:start position:0%
the first amendment of the mou
 
04:51:02.110 --> 04:51:02.120 align:start position:0%
in uh
 
04:51:02.120 --> 04:51:03.670 align:start position:0%
in uh
2008

04:51:03.670 --> 04:51:03.680 align:start position:0%
2008
 
04:51:05.910 --> 04:51:05.920 align:start position:0%
prior to 2009
 
04:51:07.910 --> 04:51:07.920 align:start position:0%
in 2009
 
04:51:11.270 --> 04:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
when we worked with both boards to
 
04:51:13.030 --> 04:51:13.040 align:start position:0%
develop this distribution funding
 
04:51:15.910 --> 04:51:15.920 align:start position:0%
formula which is currently in law
 
04:51:19.670 --> 04:51:19.680 align:start position:0%
both boards unanimously agreed to the
 
04:51:22.628 --> 04:51:22.638 align:start position:0%
distribution formula in fact that's been
 
04:51:23.670 --> 04:51:23.680 align:start position:0%
the way
 
04:51:26.150 --> 04:51:26.160 align:start position:0%
that all legislation referencing the
 
04:51:28.628 --> 04:51:28.638 align:start position:0%
distribution formula has occurred
 
04:51:31.110 --> 04:51:31.120 align:start position:0%
it's been unanimously agreed upon by all
 
04:51:33.830 --> 04:51:33.840 align:start position:0%
those that are participating i might add
 
04:51:35.830 --> 04:51:35.840 align:start position:0%
that one of those select board members
 
04:51:35.840 --> 04:51:36.628 align:start position:0%
that one of those select board members
that

04:51:36.628 --> 04:51:36.638 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:51:39.350 --> 04:51:39.360 align:start position:0%
was living in woodsville at that time in
 
04:51:41.830 --> 04:51:41.840 align:start position:0%
2009 is now living down the street from
 
04:51:43.750 --> 04:51:43.760 align:start position:0%
me in haverhill corner
 
04:51:45.670 --> 04:51:45.680 align:start position:0%
when we were on the board at that time
 
04:51:47.990 --> 04:51:48.000 align:start position:0%
and i was on that board we never thought
 
04:51:50.788 --> 04:51:50.798 align:start position:0%
of ourselves as i'm from woodsville i'm
 
04:51:52.868 --> 04:51:52.878 align:start position:0%
from mountain lakes or i'm from north
 
04:51:55.030 --> 04:51:55.040 align:start position:0%
haverhill or haverhill corner
 
04:51:57.830 --> 04:51:57.840 align:start position:0%
we represented all of haverhill
 
04:52:00.390 --> 04:52:00.400 align:start position:0%
so when we made a decision we made a
 
04:52:03.110 --> 04:52:03.120 align:start position:0%
decision in the best uh the betterment
 
04:52:05.990 --> 04:52:06.000 align:start position:0%
of all the whole good of the town we did
 
04:52:09.030 --> 04:52:09.040 align:start position:0%
that also when we changed how fire
 
04:52:10.948 --> 04:52:10.958 align:start position:0%
departments were funded
 
04:52:13.190 --> 04:52:13.200 align:start position:0%
we used to fund all our fire departments
 
04:52:15.110 --> 04:52:15.120 align:start position:0%
three of them have corner
 
04:52:17.670 --> 04:52:17.680 align:start position:0%
north haverhill and woodsville by the
 
04:52:20.310 --> 04:52:20.320 align:start position:0%
precinct voters in those areas but
 
04:52:22.230 --> 04:52:22.240 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of haverhill not in those
 
04:52:23.590 --> 04:52:23.600 align:start position:0%
three areas
 
04:52:27.430 --> 04:52:27.440 align:start position:0%
and back before 2009 or so the people
 
04:52:29.750 --> 04:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
outside these precincts were not paying
 
04:52:31.670 --> 04:52:31.680 align:start position:0%
for fire coverage at all
 
04:52:33.830 --> 04:52:33.840 align:start position:0%
so we changed that so the town now
 
04:52:36.470 --> 04:52:36.480 align:start position:0%
assesses everybody for fire departments
 
04:52:38.550 --> 04:52:38.560 align:start position:0%
and the money was then distributed to
 
04:52:41.430 --> 04:52:41.440 align:start position:0%
those individual precinct departments
 
04:52:43.750 --> 04:52:43.760 align:start position:0%
and yes we do have a town fire
 
04:52:46.230 --> 04:52:46.240 align:start position:0%
department now that was recently done by
 
04:52:49.110 --> 04:52:49.120 align:start position:0%
way of war arctic but the first time
 
04:52:49.120 --> 04:52:49.990 align:start position:0%
way of war arctic but the first time
the

04:52:49.990 --> 04:52:50.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:52:52.628 --> 04:52:52.638 align:start position:0%
haverhill corner folks were asked to
 
04:52:54.868 --> 04:52:54.878 align:start position:0%
support the new town
 
04:52:57.910 --> 04:52:57.920 align:start position:0%
fire department they absolutely said no
 
04:52:59.990 --> 04:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
we don't want anything to do with it we
 
04:53:03.110 --> 04:53:03.120 align:start position:0%
need to see a long-range plan as far
 
04:53:04.868 --> 04:53:04.878 align:start position:0%
what are the costs going to be how our
 
04:53:07.830 --> 04:53:07.840 align:start position:0%
fire insurance is going to be affected
 
04:53:10.708 --> 04:53:10.718 align:start position:0%
all that well the same issue is now
 
04:53:15.030 --> 04:53:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:17.190 --> 04:53:17.200 align:start position:0%
we have woodsville which is much
 
04:53:20.628 --> 04:53:20.638 align:start position:0%
different than the rest of the community
 
04:53:22.948 --> 04:53:22.958 align:start position:0%
whichville is the commercial center
 
04:53:24.948 --> 04:53:24.958 align:start position:0%
woodsville has sewer
 
04:53:27.590 --> 04:53:27.600 align:start position:0%
water sidewalks we don't have that
 
04:53:30.070 --> 04:53:30.080 align:start position:0%
except in one location in north
 
04:53:30.080 --> 04:53:31.350 align:start position:0%
except in one location in north
haverhill

04:53:31.350 --> 04:53:31.360 align:start position:0%
haverhill
 
04:53:33.670 --> 04:53:33.680 align:start position:0%
along route 10.
 
04:53:35.830 --> 04:53:35.840 align:start position:0%
so the the cost of maintaining these
 
04:53:37.750 --> 04:53:37.760 align:start position:0%
roads when we're dealing with water
 
04:53:39.110 --> 04:53:39.120 align:start position:0%
under the roads when we're dealing with
 
04:53:40.868 --> 04:53:40.878 align:start position:0%
sewer sewer our course are going to have
 
04:53:43.270 --> 04:53:43.280 align:start position:0%
to be more for those eight miles of
 
04:53:45.910 --> 04:53:45.920 align:start position:0%
roads in woodsville than the rest where
 
04:53:48.948 --> 04:53:48.958 align:start position:0%
it's dirt or gravel or pavement
 
04:53:51.670 --> 04:53:51.680 align:start position:0%
and but we all see and share the same
 
04:53:53.510 --> 04:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
need to have good transportation
 
04:53:57.110 --> 04:53:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:59.670 --> 04:53:59.680 align:start position:0%
we've when we went back in 2009 and
 
04:54:01.670 --> 04:54:01.680 align:start position:0%
looked at this distribution formula i
 
04:54:04.390 --> 04:54:04.400 align:start position:0%
also asked at that time the town manager
 
04:54:06.628 --> 04:54:06.638 align:start position:0%
mr glenn english who is an excellent
 
04:54:09.110 --> 04:54:09.120 align:start position:0%
town manager and has the techno
 
04:54:11.910 --> 04:54:11.920 align:start position:0%
technical skills to produce a fiscal
 
04:54:14.550 --> 04:54:14.560 align:start position:0%
report i asked him to put together a
 
04:54:14.560 --> 04:54:15.350 align:start position:0%
report i asked him to put together a
long

04:54:15.350 --> 04:54:15.360 align:start position:0%
long
 
04:54:18.550 --> 04:54:18.560 align:start position:0%
a plan which shows where are our monies
 
04:54:21.030 --> 04:54:21.040 align:start position:0%
really being used for because at that
 
04:54:23.030 --> 04:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
time many people said well our police
 
04:54:24.310 --> 04:54:24.320 align:start position:0%
department's always hanging out in
 
04:54:26.230 --> 04:54:26.240 align:start position:0%
woodsville so all our dollars are being
 
04:54:28.550 --> 04:54:28.560 align:start position:0%
spent in woodsville when we did that
 
04:54:31.830 --> 04:54:31.840 align:start position:0%
analysis for all our departments it came
 
04:54:34.310 --> 04:54:34.320 align:start position:0%
out a wash for the entire town
 
04:54:36.788 --> 04:54:36.798 align:start position:0%
woodsworth was not receiving any more
 
04:54:39.030 --> 04:54:39.040 align:start position:0%
than any other location within the
 
04:54:39.040 --> 04:54:40.628 align:start position:0%
than any other location within the
community

04:54:40.628 --> 04:54:40.638 align:start position:0%
community
 
04:54:43.590 --> 04:54:43.600 align:start position:0%
we also know in looking at projections
 
04:54:45.030 --> 04:54:45.040 align:start position:0%
for where we're going in the next five
 
04:54:46.390 --> 04:54:46.400 align:start position:0%
or ten years
 
04:54:48.390 --> 04:54:48.400 align:start position:0%
the tax base is definitely going to be
 
04:54:50.310 --> 04:54:50.320 align:start position:0%
in woodsville
 
04:54:52.550 --> 04:54:52.560 align:start position:0%
and you you have places like walmart
 
04:54:53.590 --> 04:54:53.600 align:start position:0%
there now
 
04:54:55.590 --> 04:54:55.600 align:start position:0%
our meals and rooms tax our restaurants
 
04:54:58.788 --> 04:54:58.798 align:start position:0%
our hotel motel lodging is up there in
 
04:54:58.798 --> 04:55:00.230 align:start position:0%
our hotel motel lodging is up there in
woodsville

04:55:00.230 --> 04:55:00.240 align:start position:0%
woodsville
 
04:55:02.310 --> 04:55:02.320 align:start position:0%
and i see the revenues coming into
 
04:55:04.150 --> 04:55:04.160 align:start position:0%
woodsville being much higher than that
 
04:55:06.150 --> 04:55:06.160 align:start position:0%
at the rest of the community but what
 
04:55:08.470 --> 04:55:08.480 align:start position:0%
the rest of the community is residential
 
04:55:10.868 --> 04:55:10.878 align:start position:0%
and as with any large municipality or
 
04:55:13.430 --> 04:55:13.440 align:start position:0%
municipality of around five thousand uh
 
04:55:15.110 --> 04:55:15.120 align:start position:0%
people in it you're going to have
 
04:55:17.030 --> 04:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
certain areas which are residential in
 
04:55:19.030 --> 04:55:19.040 align:start position:0%
certain areas the more urban and have
 
04:55:21.590 --> 04:55:21.600 align:start position:0%
urban residential yes but they are more
 
04:55:23.830 --> 04:55:23.840 align:start position:0%
oriented towards commercial business
 
04:55:25.270 --> 04:55:25.280 align:start position:0%
which i don't think there's too many
 
04:55:27.270 --> 04:55:27.280 align:start position:0%
days that go by that i don't don't drive
 
04:55:30.550 --> 04:55:30.560 align:start position:0%
up into woodsville to do my shopping
 
04:55:34.310 --> 04:55:34.320 align:start position:0%
so going on down here when hb414 came up
 
04:55:36.390 --> 04:55:36.400 align:start position:0%
in 2020
 
04:55:39.670 --> 04:55:39.680 align:start position:0%
um both boards met with rep senator
 
04:55:42.628 --> 04:55:42.638 align:start position:0%
gaida and myself and we were discussing
 
04:55:44.788 --> 04:55:44.798 align:start position:0%
what do we need to do with this there
 
04:55:47.830 --> 04:55:47.840 align:start position:0%
was agreement on one issue now some
 
04:55:49.590 --> 04:55:49.600 align:start position:0%
people said though well that that
 
04:55:51.510 --> 04:55:51.520 align:start position:0%
nothing came out from that first meeting
 
04:55:53.270 --> 04:55:53.280 align:start position:0%
yes it did
 
04:55:55.350 --> 04:55:55.360 align:start position:0%
we have highway money which goes to
 
04:55:56.628 --> 04:55:56.638 align:start position:0%
woodsville that comes out of the
 
04:55:58.470 --> 04:55:58.480 align:start position:0%
operating budget for the community you
 
04:55:59.430 --> 04:55:59.440 align:start position:0%
know that
 
04:56:01.670 --> 04:56:01.680 align:start position:0%
you've heard the split but there's also
 
04:56:04.070 --> 04:56:04.080 align:start position:0%
highway block money revenue which comes
 
04:56:06.550 --> 04:56:06.560 align:start position:0%
down from the state from d.o.t to
 
04:56:06.560 --> 04:56:08.230 align:start position:0%
down from the state from d.o.t to
municipalities

04:56:08.230 --> 04:56:08.240 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
04:56:10.628 --> 04:56:10.638 align:start position:0%
and because it goes to municipalities
 
04:56:13.510 --> 04:56:13.520 align:start position:0%
not to precincts or districts then the
 
04:56:16.390 --> 04:56:16.400 align:start position:0%
share which goes down to woodsville
 
04:56:18.628 --> 04:56:18.638 align:start position:0%
comes by way of the town and is
 
04:56:21.190 --> 04:56:21.200 align:start position:0%
distributed out we have been dispersing
 
04:56:23.430 --> 04:56:23.440 align:start position:0%
that money not out not in the same
 
04:56:25.990 --> 04:56:26.000 align:start position:0%
manner that the state disperses the
 
04:56:28.470 --> 04:56:28.480 align:start position:0%
money to the municipalities so there was
 
04:56:30.230 --> 04:56:30.240 align:start position:0%
agreement that we should use the same
 
04:56:32.550 --> 04:56:32.560 align:start position:0%
process the same formula as the state
 
04:56:34.708 --> 04:56:34.718 align:start position:0%
sends money to the
 
04:56:37.110 --> 04:56:37.120 align:start position:0%
to the municipalities from this
 
04:56:39.750 --> 04:56:39.760 align:start position:0%
municipality haverhill to the fire
 
04:56:43.030 --> 04:56:43.040 align:start position:0%
district woodsville there was agreement
 
04:56:44.948 --> 04:56:44.958 align:start position:0%
now there was no agreement in regard to
 
04:56:47.510 --> 04:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
some of the other issues but i know and
 
04:56:49.670 --> 04:56:49.680 align:start position:0%
you know that the first time you sit
 
04:56:51.590 --> 04:56:51.600 align:start position:0%
down at a meeting
 
04:56:54.230 --> 04:56:54.240 align:start position:0%
you have to really work hard roll the
 
04:56:56.150 --> 04:56:56.160 align:start position:0%
sleeves up and it takes a while to get
 
04:56:58.470 --> 04:56:58.480 align:start position:0%
there it took us a long time to get
 
04:56:59.990 --> 04:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
there in regard to
 
04:57:01.990 --> 04:57:02.000 align:start position:0%
having the whole town take ownership in
 
04:57:03.910 --> 04:57:03.920 align:start position:0%
how we fund our fire departments but we
 
04:57:05.430 --> 04:57:05.440 align:start position:0%
did that
 
04:57:07.270 --> 04:57:07.280 align:start position:0%
now that we're in the fire department
 
04:57:09.510 --> 04:57:09.520 align:start position:0%
business and and going that direction
 
04:57:12.708 --> 04:57:12.718 align:start position:0%
the only reason why primarily
 
04:57:15.830 --> 04:57:15.840 align:start position:0%
haverhill corner has opted to join the
 
04:57:17.910 --> 04:57:17.920 align:start position:0%
no the town fire department which
 
04:57:20.470 --> 04:57:20.480 align:start position:0%
consists only of north haverhill is that
 
04:57:22.390 --> 04:57:22.400 align:start position:0%
the fun money that was supporting our
 
04:57:24.708 --> 04:57:24.718 align:start position:0%
fire department came down from everybody
 
04:57:27.830 --> 04:57:27.840 align:start position:0%
raising revenue in this town through the
 
04:57:29.430 --> 04:57:29.440 align:start position:0%
to through the town
 
04:57:31.190 --> 04:57:31.200 align:start position:0%
well with the threat that we may not
 
04:57:34.390 --> 04:57:34.400 align:start position:0%
receive that money obviously the the 190
 
04:57:36.070 --> 04:57:36.080 align:start position:0%
uh some odd people in haverhill corner
 
04:57:38.150 --> 04:57:38.160 align:start position:0%
said well we we will we'll join that
 
04:57:41.670 --> 04:57:41.680 align:start position:0%
department they did by a very close vote
 
04:57:43.270 --> 04:57:43.280 align:start position:0%
so there
 
04:57:45.910 --> 04:57:45.920 align:start position:0%
this there are issues that we need to
 
04:57:49.270 --> 04:57:49.280 align:start position:0%
look at it takes time for change
 
04:57:51.830 --> 04:57:51.840 align:start position:0%
but the plan that to move forward with
 
04:57:54.470 --> 04:57:54.480 align:start position:0%
roads what is the plan
 
04:57:57.190 --> 04:57:57.200 align:start position:0%
immediately following when the town
 
04:57:58.868 --> 04:57:58.878 align:start position:0%
takes over the woodsville roads what
 
04:58:00.868 --> 04:58:00.878 align:start position:0%
happens to the labor force within woods
 
04:58:03.110 --> 04:58:03.120 align:start position:0%
will what about their benefits what
 
04:58:04.788 --> 04:58:04.798 align:start position:0%
about their retirement how are they
 
04:58:06.230 --> 04:58:06.240 align:start position:0%
going to be taken care of is there any
 
04:58:07.590 --> 04:58:07.600 align:start position:0%
guarantee they're going to still be
 
04:58:10.070 --> 04:58:10.080 align:start position:0%
there what happens in terms of
 
04:58:12.708 --> 04:58:12.718 align:start position:0%
a long-range plan in terms of the
 
04:58:15.270 --> 04:58:15.280 align:start position:0%
the maintenance of all the other issues
 
04:58:17.350 --> 04:58:17.360 align:start position:0%
water department in in in woodsville
 
04:58:18.708 --> 04:58:18.718 align:start position:0%
what happens to the sewer that comes
 
04:58:20.868 --> 04:58:20.878 align:start position:0%
from north haverhill down into
 
04:58:20.878 --> 04:58:21.750 align:start position:0%
from north haverhill down into
uh

04:58:21.750 --> 04:58:21.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:58:24.150 --> 04:58:24.160 align:start position:0%
uh woodsville where it's treated and and
 
04:58:25.750 --> 04:58:25.760 align:start position:0%
taken care of there
 
04:58:25.760 --> 04:58:26.550 align:start position:0%
taken care of there
uh

04:58:26.550 --> 04:58:26.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:58:28.708 --> 04:58:28.718 align:start position:0%
i think the folks in woodsville as the
 
04:58:30.628 --> 04:58:30.638 align:start position:0%
people in haverhill corner we're looking
 
04:58:33.430 --> 04:58:33.440 align:start position:0%
for yes we want to we want to work
 
04:58:35.670 --> 04:58:35.680 align:start position:0%
towards all being one town working
 
04:58:38.470 --> 04:58:38.480 align:start position:0%
together and which we try to do
 
04:58:40.470 --> 04:58:40.480 align:start position:0%
but we need to see the plan
 
04:58:43.190 --> 04:58:43.200 align:start position:0%
how's that going to impact our our local
 
04:58:46.788 --> 04:58:46.798 align:start position:0%
expenses our assets our revenues and if
 
04:58:49.270 --> 04:58:49.280 align:start position:0%
that can be all laid out then people are
 
04:58:51.030 --> 04:58:51.040 align:start position:0%
willing to sit down and talk i don't
 
04:58:53.350 --> 04:58:53.360 align:start position:0%
believe that's all been laid out to the
 
04:58:56.948 --> 04:58:56.958 align:start position:0%
woodsville fire district this is a very
 
04:58:58.708 --> 04:58:58.718 align:start position:0%
divisive issue
 
04:59:00.868 --> 04:59:00.878 align:start position:0%
and there is litigation going on right
 
04:59:03.190 --> 04:59:03.200 align:start position:0%
now which is a shame that each of us in
 
04:59:04.470 --> 04:59:04.480 align:start position:0%
woodsville and the rest of the town are
 
04:59:07.030 --> 04:59:07.040 align:start position:0%
having to use our local revenues to
 
04:59:10.550 --> 04:59:10.560 align:start position:0%
fight each other this has to stop uh it
 
04:59:13.190 --> 04:59:13.200 align:start position:0%
just cannot continue in regard to the
 
04:59:13.200 --> 04:59:14.150 align:start position:0%
just cannot continue in regard to the
audit

04:59:14.150 --> 04:59:14.160 align:start position:0%
audit
 
04:59:16.550 --> 04:59:16.560 align:start position:0%
i have spoken with the manager that's
 
04:59:19.190 --> 04:59:19.200 align:start position:0%
been recently hired who comes back comes
 
04:59:21.750 --> 04:59:21.760 align:start position:0%
to us from industry here in new
 
04:59:21.760 --> 04:59:23.110 align:start position:0%
to us from industry here in new
hampshire

04:59:23.110 --> 04:59:23.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
04:59:25.030 --> 04:59:25.040 align:start position:0%
and has a good understanding how to
 
04:59:27.750 --> 04:59:27.760 align:start position:0%
manage how to administrate uh units such
 
04:59:30.788 --> 04:59:30.798 align:start position:0%
as the woodsworth uh departments
 
04:59:32.628 --> 04:59:32.638 align:start position:0%
which have been now merged into one
 
04:59:35.670 --> 04:59:35.680 align:start position:0%
under one roof which he manages and
 
04:59:38.550 --> 04:59:38.560 align:start position:0%
there the first several years yes errors
 
04:59:40.628 --> 04:59:40.638 align:start position:0%
have been found they found errors in
 
04:59:42.390 --> 04:59:42.400 align:start position:0%
other areas of haverhill when we had our
 
04:59:44.628 --> 04:59:44.638 align:start position:0%
audits done for our annual audit they
 
04:59:47.430 --> 04:59:47.440 align:start position:0%
found errors and piermonts too which
 
04:59:49.510 --> 04:59:49.520 align:start position:0%
piermont went through a disastrous time
 
04:59:51.590 --> 04:59:51.600 align:start position:0%
several years back
 
04:59:53.830 --> 04:59:53.840 align:start position:0%
so these things happen but it's not
 
04:59:53.840 --> 04:59:55.270 align:start position:0%
so these things happen but it's not
fraudulent

04:59:55.270 --> 04:59:55.280 align:start position:0%
fraudulent
 
04:59:57.190 --> 04:59:57.200 align:start position:0%
and nothing has been proven to be
 
05:00:00.150 --> 05:00:00.160 align:start position:0%
fraudulent in the audit the audit should
 
05:00:03.270 --> 05:00:03.280 align:start position:0%
be done sometime later this summer
 
05:00:03.280 --> 05:00:04.150 align:start position:0%
be done sometime later this summer
and

05:00:04.150 --> 05:00:04.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:00:06.470 --> 05:00:06.480 align:start position:0%
i think it's very premature
 
05:00:08.708 --> 05:00:08.718 align:start position:0%
to be acting on a bill such as this
 
05:00:11.350 --> 05:00:11.360 align:start position:0%
without having a good strong knowledge
 
05:00:13.910 --> 05:00:13.920 align:start position:0%
of what that audit has netted us
 
05:00:17.190 --> 05:00:17.200 align:start position:0%
and we don't have that yet so i i'm not
 
05:00:19.990 --> 05:00:20.000 align:start position:0%
supportive of this bill i think the bill
 
05:00:22.788 --> 05:00:22.798 align:start position:0%
has a lot of areas which
 
05:00:25.990 --> 05:00:26.000 align:start position:0%
need really a good stiff look at
 
05:00:28.550 --> 05:00:28.560 align:start position:0%
there's areas in which the distribution
 
05:00:31.270 --> 05:00:31.280 align:start position:0%
formula was agreed by all in the
 
05:00:31.280 --> 05:00:32.470 align:start position:0%
formula was agreed by all in the
community

05:00:32.470 --> 05:00:32.480 align:start position:0%
community
 
05:00:34.310 --> 05:00:34.320 align:start position:0%
and by that i mean all those lived in
 
05:00:34.320 --> 05:00:35.270 align:start position:0%
and by that i mean all those lived in
haverhill

05:00:35.270 --> 05:00:35.280 align:start position:0%
haverhill
 
05:00:38.470 --> 05:00:38.480 align:start position:0%
and it's um it's it's worked
 
05:00:41.110 --> 05:00:41.120 align:start position:0%
uh now there might be some disagreement
 
05:00:43.510 --> 05:00:43.520 align:start position:0%
as to what is the definition of a net
 
05:00:45.510 --> 05:00:45.520 align:start position:0%
operating budget versus the highway
 
05:00:47.990 --> 05:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
operating budget that could be
 
05:00:49.910 --> 05:00:49.920 align:start position:0%
easily resolved by just putting
 
05:00:52.550 --> 05:00:52.560 align:start position:0%
definition into the statute
 
05:00:55.270 --> 05:00:55.280 align:start position:0%
also it could be made you know a statute
 
05:00:57.830 --> 05:00:57.840 align:start position:0%
could be had amended somewhere along the
 
05:00:59.510 --> 05:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
way i don't know if this is the time to
 
05:01:02.550 --> 05:01:02.560 align:start position:0%
do it perhaps not but a statute could be
 
05:01:05.910 --> 05:01:05.920 align:start position:0%
amended stating that any future changes
 
05:01:08.708 --> 05:01:08.718 align:start position:0%
are may be done by the two boards the
 
05:01:10.550 --> 05:01:10.560 align:start position:0%
commissioners and the select board
 
05:01:12.948 --> 05:01:12.958 align:start position:0%
working together without having to have
 
05:01:14.868 --> 05:01:14.878 align:start position:0%
the approval of the general court
 
05:01:16.708 --> 05:01:16.718 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of things that can be done
 
05:01:20.150 --> 05:01:20.160 align:start position:0%
here and that is why we need to really
 
05:01:22.550 --> 05:01:22.560 align:start position:0%
take some time here and i urge this
 
05:01:22.560 --> 05:01:23.670 align:start position:0%
take some time here and i urge this
committee

05:01:23.670 --> 05:01:23.680 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:01:26.550 --> 05:01:26.560 align:start position:0%
to take some time and looking at this
 
05:01:29.190 --> 05:01:29.200 align:start position:0%
this has been highly contentious down in
 
05:01:30.628 --> 05:01:30.638 align:start position:0%
in the community
 
05:01:32.230 --> 05:01:32.240 align:start position:0%
we've had this before when it came to
 
05:01:33.510 --> 05:01:33.520 align:start position:0%
our schools
 
05:01:34.948 --> 05:01:34.958 align:start position:0%
folks in haverhill corner didn't like
 
05:01:37.270 --> 05:01:37.280 align:start position:0%
the idea taking the haverhill academy
 
05:01:38.868 --> 05:01:38.878 align:start position:0%
out of haverhill corner
 
05:01:40.070 --> 05:01:40.080 align:start position:0%
and taking the high school up to
 
05:01:42.550 --> 05:01:42.560 align:start position:0%
woodsville so it's nothing new we sort
 
05:01:44.628 --> 05:01:44.638 align:start position:0%
of got getting out of that old cultural
 
05:01:46.708 --> 05:01:46.718 align:start position:0%
thinking and we're becoming a town in
 
05:01:49.030 --> 05:01:49.040 align:start position:0%
terms of our schools haverhill is an old
 
05:01:51.270 --> 05:01:51.280 align:start position:0%
community much like conway used to be
 
05:01:53.590 --> 05:01:53.600 align:start position:0%
with their precincts we're getting there
 
05:01:56.070 --> 05:01:56.080 align:start position:0%
we're moving there but we have to move
 
05:01:58.550 --> 05:01:58.560 align:start position:0%
there with uh
 
05:02:01.270 --> 05:02:01.280 align:start position:0%
with foresight and with a good look at
 
05:02:03.030 --> 05:02:03.040 align:start position:0%
what we're going to be five to ten years
 
05:02:04.788 --> 05:02:04.798 align:start position:0%
down the road we want to move to
 
05:02:07.670 --> 05:02:07.680 align:start position:0%
something that's going to not cost us
 
05:02:09.190 --> 05:02:09.200 align:start position:0%
out of the business
 
05:02:10.868 --> 05:02:10.878 align:start position:0%
we want to move that we have something
 
05:02:12.550 --> 05:02:12.560 align:start position:0%
that's more efficient
 
05:02:14.628 --> 05:02:14.638 align:start position:0%
and we need to work there together so we
 
05:02:17.510 --> 05:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
all have ownership in it right now by
 
05:02:19.830 --> 05:02:19.840 align:start position:0%
the state making a decision
 
05:02:21.830 --> 05:02:21.840 align:start position:0%
on this issue
 
05:02:24.708 --> 05:02:24.718 align:start position:0%
we're we're just mandating hey roll this
 
05:02:26.390 --> 05:02:26.400 align:start position:0%
is how things will happen
 
05:02:27.830 --> 05:02:27.840 align:start position:0%
there's no ownership that's going to
 
05:02:30.788 --> 05:02:30.798 align:start position:0%
come about that and we really run the
 
05:02:30.798 --> 05:02:31.990 align:start position:0%
come about that and we really run the
risk

05:02:31.990 --> 05:02:32.000 align:start position:0%
risk
 
05:02:34.708 --> 05:02:34.718 align:start position:0%
of having one precinct trying to become
 
05:02:37.030 --> 05:02:37.040 align:start position:0%
their own municipality
 
05:02:40.948 --> 05:02:40.958 align:start position:0%
article 24 in 2020 which was on our town
 
05:02:40.958 --> 05:02:42.708 align:start position:0%
article 24 in 2020 which was on our town
report

05:02:42.708 --> 05:02:42.718 align:start position:0%
report
 
05:02:45.190 --> 05:02:45.200 align:start position:0%
asked the voters whether they wanted to
 
05:02:47.110 --> 05:02:47.120 align:start position:0%
take over ownership of the highway
 
05:02:49.590 --> 05:02:49.600 align:start position:0%
system in woodsville
 
05:02:51.590 --> 05:02:51.600 align:start position:0%
contingent upon
 
05:02:54.070 --> 05:02:54.080 align:start position:0%
the woodsville residence
 
05:02:54.080 --> 05:02:55.670 align:start position:0%
the woodsville residence
agreeing

05:02:55.670 --> 05:02:55.680 align:start position:0%
agreeing
 
05:02:57.830 --> 05:02:57.840 align:start position:0%
when it went to the woodsville residence
 
05:03:01.590 --> 05:03:01.600 align:start position:0%
for the agreement the vote was 52-0
 
05:03:06.390 --> 05:03:06.400 align:start position:0%
not to join haverhill at this time
 
05:03:08.550 --> 05:03:08.560 align:start position:0%
there was no plan paralleling that
 
05:03:10.708 --> 05:03:10.718 align:start position:0%
request or that article
 
05:03:12.948 --> 05:03:12.958 align:start position:0%
so in conclusion i know i've talked
 
05:03:14.948 --> 05:03:14.958 align:start position:0%
quite a bit here i'm willing to take
 
05:03:17.350 --> 05:03:17.360 align:start position:0%

is james just talk a little bit about
 
05:04:19.270 --> 05:04:19.280 align:start position:0%
the audit of what you know
 
05:04:21.590 --> 05:04:21.600 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to preface this all by a
 
05:04:24.708 --> 05:04:24.718 align:start position:0%
request that you send whatever
 
05:04:28.150 --> 05:04:28.160 align:start position:0%
parts of the completed id audit you can
 
05:04:30.868 --> 05:04:30.878 align:start position:0%
to members of the community
 
05:04:33.190 --> 05:04:33.200 align:start position:0%
okay well we uh certainly first thank
 
05:04:35.430 --> 05:04:35.440 align:start position:0%
you for uh entertaining
 
05:04:37.910 --> 05:04:37.920 align:start position:0%
me and allowing me to speak on this
 
05:04:39.750 --> 05:04:39.760 align:start position:0%
important legislation
 
05:04:41.590 --> 05:04:41.600 align:start position:0%
uh there are there are you know two
 
05:04:43.030 --> 05:04:43.040 align:start position:0%
parts of the legislation i'm not going
 
05:04:45.430 --> 05:04:45.440 align:start position:0%
to comment as the dra takes no position
 
05:04:48.470 --> 05:04:48.480 align:start position:0%
on the first part of the legislation
 
05:04:50.550 --> 05:04:50.560 align:start position:0%
the the second part of the legislation
 
05:04:53.670 --> 05:04:53.680 align:start position:0%
is really what we care about and it is
 
05:04:56.590 --> 05:04:56.600 align:start position:0%
really because rsa
 
05:04:59.510 --> 05:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
4131a states that financial audits play
 
05:05:01.670 --> 05:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
a fundamentally vital role in helping to
 
05:05:03.990 --> 05:05:04.000 align:start position:0%
preserve the integrity of the public
 
05:05:06.230 --> 05:05:06.240 align:start position:0%
finance functions by maintaining
 
05:05:08.708 --> 05:05:08.718 align:start position:0%
citizens confidence in their elected
 
05:05:08.718 --> 05:05:10.070 align:start position:0%
citizens confidence in their elected
leaders

05:05:10.070 --> 05:05:10.080 align:start position:0%
leaders
 
05:05:11.750 --> 05:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
properly performed audits provide
 
05:05:13.910 --> 05:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
independent assurance that financial
 
05:05:17.510 --> 05:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
information presented is reliable
 
05:05:18.948 --> 05:05:18.958 align:start position:0%
because of this new hampshire law
 
05:05:20.868 --> 05:05:20.878 align:start position:0%
mandates that all municipalities with
 
05:05:24.070 --> 05:05:24.080 align:start position:0%
populations of greater than 750 conduct
 
05:05:26.150 --> 05:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
an annual audit
 
05:05:27.670 --> 05:05:27.680 align:start position:0%
now over the last 20 years the
 
05:05:29.510 --> 05:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
woodsville fire district attempted to
 
05:05:31.910 --> 05:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
complete just one audit and that was in
 
05:05:31.920 --> 05:05:33.430 align:start position:0%
complete just one audit and that was in
2014

05:05:33.430 --> 05:05:33.440 align:start position:0%
2014
 
05:05:35.350 --> 05:05:35.360 align:start position:0%
that audit was not completed because
 
05:05:37.110 --> 05:05:37.120 align:start position:0%
officials in the district refused to
 
05:05:39.670 --> 05:05:39.680 align:start position:0%
turn over the necessary documents
 
05:05:44.230 --> 05:05:44.240 align:start position:0%
over a dispute about confidentiality
 
05:05:47.510 --> 05:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
since 2014 the district elected numerous
 
05:05:50.070 --> 05:05:50.080 align:start position:0%
auditors and made statements both to the
 
05:05:52.310 --> 05:05:52.320 align:start position:0%
public and to the dra that they had
 
05:05:54.708 --> 05:05:54.718 align:start position:0%
audited financials however after we
 
05:05:56.788 --> 05:05:56.798 align:start position:0%
investigated the situation we realized
 
05:05:59.110 --> 05:05:59.120 align:start position:0%
that the locally elected auditor
 
05:06:01.190 --> 05:06:01.200 align:start position:0%
never actually performed an audit and
 
05:06:02.868 --> 05:06:02.878 align:start position:0%
the audited financial statements they
 
05:06:04.788 --> 05:06:04.798 align:start position:0%
claimed to have were nothing more than
 
05:06:07.510 --> 05:06:07.520 align:start position:0%
unaudited financial statements
 
05:06:08.868 --> 05:06:08.878 align:start position:0%
the first time we actually saw a
 
05:06:11.190 --> 05:06:11.200 align:start position:0%
movement towards completing an audit was
 
05:06:14.708 --> 05:06:14.718 align:start position:0%
when sb 414 was introduced last year
 
05:06:16.628 --> 05:06:16.638 align:start position:0%
this bill which passed the house and
 
05:06:19.430 --> 05:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
senate imposed the same penalties that
 
05:06:21.030 --> 05:06:21.040 align:start position:0%
this bill does for not completing their
 
05:06:23.350 --> 05:06:23.360 align:start position:0%
audits in a timely fashion
 
05:06:25.110 --> 05:06:25.120 align:start position:0%
as a result of the pressure put on the
 
05:06:27.830 --> 05:06:27.840 align:start position:0%
district in 2020 they engaged the firmer
 
05:06:29.510 --> 05:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
plazak and sanderson to complete at
 
05:06:31.910 --> 05:06:31.920 align:start position:0%
least five years of audits to date they
 
05:06:34.230 --> 05:06:34.240 align:start position:0%
have completed three of these audits
 
05:06:37.030 --> 05:06:37.040 align:start position:0%
these audits reveal numerous violations
 
05:06:38.708 --> 05:06:38.718 align:start position:0%
of state statutes
 
05:06:41.910 --> 05:06:41.920 align:start position:0%
these include violations of rsa 32 the
 
05:06:44.868 --> 05:06:44.878 align:start position:0%
municipal budget law rsa 33 the
 
05:06:47.190 --> 05:06:47.200 align:start position:0%
municipal finance act and additional
 
05:06:51.030 --> 05:06:51.040 align:start position:0%
violations of rsa 41.
 
05:06:52.868 --> 05:06:52.878 align:start position:0%
some of the potential violations or
 
05:06:55.190 --> 05:06:55.200 align:start position:0%
violations actually include taking out
 
05:06:57.110 --> 05:06:57.120 align:start position:0%
loans without first getting
 
05:06:58.948 --> 05:06:58.958 align:start position:0%
approval from the voters under new
 
05:07:00.948 --> 05:07:00.958 align:start position:0%
hampshire law you're supposed to get 60
 
05:07:02.628 --> 05:07:02.638 align:start position:0%
approval from the voters
 
05:07:04.708 --> 05:07:04.718 align:start position:0%
uh they took out loans without getting
 
05:07:07.190 --> 05:07:07.200 align:start position:0%
any support from the electorate filing
 
05:07:09.110 --> 05:07:09.120 align:start position:0%
incomplete or misleading forms with the
 
05:07:11.590 --> 05:07:11.600 align:start position:0%
dra that concealed these loans
 
05:07:13.350 --> 05:07:13.360 align:start position:0%
and making risky investments that are
 
05:07:15.830 --> 05:07:15.840 align:start position:0%
contrary to state law
 
05:07:17.990 --> 05:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
the dra is in the process of further
 
05:07:22.550 --> 05:07:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:25.590 --> 05:07:25.600 align:start position:0%
this includes commingling of funds the
 
05:07:27.510 --> 05:07:27.520 align:start position:0%
audits also
 
05:07:29.830 --> 05:07:29.840 align:start position:0%
detail concerns that are not under the
 
05:07:32.470 --> 05:07:32.480 align:start position:0%
purview of the dra one such example
 
05:07:33.910 --> 05:07:33.920 align:start position:0%
which has been talked about was a
 
05:07:35.590 --> 05:07:35.600 align:start position:0%
district falsely reporting to the new
 
05:07:37.670 --> 05:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire retirement system over an
 
05:07:40.230 --> 05:07:40.240 align:start position:0%
11-year period about an employee that
 
05:07:42.470 --> 05:07:42.480 align:start position:0%
they had misca mis
 
05:07:44.230 --> 05:07:44.240 align:start position:0%
mis categorized
 
05:07:45.670 --> 05:07:45.680 align:start position:0%
in addition to the
 
05:07:47.510 --> 05:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
numerous violations of state statutes
 
05:07:49.350 --> 05:07:49.360 align:start position:0%
the audit detailed how the district had
 
05:07:51.910 --> 05:07:51.920 align:start position:0%
no meaningful internal controls in place
 
05:07:53.910 --> 05:07:53.920 align:start position:0%
that would help minimize the risk of
 
05:07:56.070 --> 05:07:56.080 align:start position:0%
fraud or human error in fact the audit
 
05:07:57.670 --> 05:07:57.680 align:start position:0%
states the following
 
05:07:59.350 --> 05:07:59.360 align:start position:0%
based upon the results of the audit
 
05:08:01.510 --> 05:08:01.520 align:start position:0%
procedures and observations made during
 
05:08:02.390 --> 05:08:02.400 align:start position:0%
the audit
 
05:08:04.070 --> 05:08:04.080 align:start position:0%
we noted the district has a lack of
 
05:08:07.030 --> 05:08:07.040 align:start position:0%
internal control and direction regarding
 
05:08:09.510 --> 05:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
the accounting system in overall
 
05:08:12.788 --> 05:08:12.798 align:start position:0%
fiscal mismanagement
 
05:08:14.550 --> 05:08:14.560 align:start position:0%
we have significant concerns that
 
05:08:17.190 --> 05:08:17.200 align:start position:0%
without the passage of senate bill 26
 
05:08:19.590 --> 05:08:19.600 align:start position:0%
the district will have little incentive
 
05:08:21.590 --> 05:08:21.600 align:start position:0%
to complete the two years of remaining
 
05:08:21.600 --> 05:08:22.550 align:start position:0%
to complete the two years of remaining
audits

05:08:22.550 --> 05:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
audits
 
05:08:24.550 --> 05:08:24.560 align:start position:0%
we believe the potential penalties
 
05:08:24.560 --> 05:08:26.550 align:start position:0%
we believe the potential penalties
imposed

05:08:26.550 --> 05:08:26.560 align:start position:0%
imposed
 
05:08:29.670 --> 05:08:29.680 align:start position:0%
by last year's sb 414 is what forced
 
05:08:31.910 --> 05:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
woodsville water and light hand
 
05:08:31.920 --> 05:08:32.628 align:start position:0%
woodsville water and light hand
and

05:08:32.628 --> 05:08:32.638 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:08:34.708 --> 05:08:34.718 align:start position:0%
in 2020 and without that the three years
 
05:08:36.070 --> 05:08:36.080 align:start position:0%
of audits we now have would not have
 
05:08:37.430 --> 05:08:37.440 align:start position:0%
been completed
 
05:08:39.670 --> 05:08:39.680 align:start position:0%
therefore the dra believes is imperative
 
05:08:41.990 --> 05:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
those penalties contained in sb 26 are
 
05:08:44.390 --> 05:08:44.400 align:start position:0%
enacted if the legislature wishes the
 
05:08:46.310 --> 05:08:46.320 align:start position:0%
dra to have a meaningful and effective
 
05:08:51.430 --> 05:08:51.440 align:start position:0%
way to enforce compliance with rsa 4131a
 
05:08:54.150 --> 05:08:54.160 align:start position:0%
and just on on a final note
 
05:08:57.030 --> 05:08:57.040 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm assuming i misheard
 
05:08:58.868 --> 05:08:58.878 align:start position:0%
a couple of speakers because i believe
 
05:09:00.310 --> 05:09:00.320 align:start position:0%
they said
 
05:09:02.470 --> 05:09:02.480 align:start position:0%
there was absolutely no way
 
05:09:04.390 --> 05:09:04.400 align:start position:0%
there was any commingling of funds and
 
05:09:06.150 --> 05:09:06.160 align:start position:0%
the audit showed that
 
05:09:08.948 --> 05:09:08.958 align:start position:0%
uh where of course on i'm looking at
 
05:09:12.310 --> 05:09:12.320 align:start position:0%
page 46 of and i just grabbed the 2016
 
05:09:12.320 --> 05:09:13.510 align:start position:0%
page 46 of and i just grabbed the 2016
audit

05:09:13.510 --> 05:09:13.520 align:start position:0%
audit
 
05:09:14.868 --> 05:09:14.878 align:start position:0%
uh under the
 
05:09:17.190 --> 05:09:17.200 align:start position:0%
compliance with state statutes payment
 
05:09:19.990 --> 05:09:20.000 align:start position:0%
in lieu of taxes from proprietary fund
 
05:09:23.030 --> 05:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
surpluses we identified three transfers
 
05:09:25.030 --> 05:09:25.040 align:start position:0%
of 15 000
 
05:09:27.670 --> 05:09:27.680 align:start position:0%
each made from accumulated fund balances
 
05:09:30.070 --> 05:09:30.080 align:start position:0%
of water fund electric fund and sewer
 
05:09:32.550 --> 05:09:32.560 align:start position:0%
fund to the district's general fund as a
 
05:09:35.110 --> 05:09:35.120 align:start position:0%
payment in lieu of taxes these transfers
 
05:09:36.070 --> 05:09:36.080 align:start position:0%
were made
 
05:09:40.070 --> 05:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
contrary to the provision of rsa 3829
 
05:09:44.390 --> 05:09:44.400 align:start position:0%
water funds and rsa 149 110 sewer fund
 
05:09:46.390 --> 05:09:46.400 align:start position:0%
what those statutes with those rsa do
 
05:09:48.948 --> 05:09:48.958 align:start position:0%
was prevent the co-mingling of funds
 
05:09:50.708 --> 05:09:50.718 align:start position:0%
which their own auditors said they did
 
05:09:52.230 --> 05:09:52.240 align:start position:0%
so again i must have misheard them when
 
05:09:53.510 --> 05:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
they said there wasn't that was not
 
05:09:54.788 --> 05:09:54.798 align:start position:0%
going on
 
05:09:58.150 --> 05:09:58.160 align:start position:0%
um i will now uh certainly open up for
 
05:10:00.550 --> 05:10:00.560 align:start position:0%
any questions you may have
 
05:10:03.110 --> 05:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
i do have
 
05:10:05.830 --> 05:10:05.840 align:start position:0%
those audits online
 
05:10:05.840 --> 05:10:06.868 align:start position:0%
those audits online
or

05:10:06.868 --> 05:10:06.878 align:start position:0%
or
 
05:10:06.878 --> 05:10:08.550 align:start position:0%
or
not

05:10:08.550 --> 05:10:08.560 align:start position:0%
not
 
05:10:11.430 --> 05:10:11.440 align:start position:0%
uh i i don't believe we we the dra does
 
05:10:11.440 --> 05:10:12.150 align:start position:0%
uh i i don't believe we we the dra does
not

05:10:12.150 --> 05:10:12.160 align:start position:0%
not
 
05:10:13.830 --> 05:10:13.840 align:start position:0%
it's online we do not have those audits
 
05:10:19.110 --> 05:10:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:20.788 --> 05:10:20.798 align:start position:0%
we send you the three years of audits
 
05:10:23.910 --> 05:10:23.920 align:start position:0%
that i have uh to you sir if if you
 
05:10:23.920 --> 05:10:24.380 align:start position:0%
that i have uh to you sir if if you
could

05:10:24.380 --> 05:10:24.390 align:start position:0%
could
 
05:10:24.390 --> 05:10:25.990 align:start position:0%
could
[Music]

05:10:25.990 --> 05:10:26.000 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:10:28.390 --> 05:10:28.400 align:start position:0%
send them to me as chairman and you can
 
05:10:29.510 --> 05:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
find my
 
05:10:30.868 --> 05:10:30.878 align:start position:0%
my email
 
05:10:32.788 --> 05:10:32.798 align:start position:0%
and any member who wants it i can
 
05:10:34.550 --> 05:10:34.560 align:start position:0%
forward it on to you
 
05:10:37.350 --> 05:10:37.360 align:start position:0%
but i think that for some of us
 
05:10:41.350 --> 05:10:41.360 align:start position:0%
um probably don't want three
 
05:10:41.360 --> 05:10:42.390 align:start position:0%
um probably don't want three
um

05:10:42.390 --> 05:10:42.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:10:44.628 --> 05:10:44.638 align:start position:0%
large volumes of audience
 
05:10:44.638 --> 05:10:45.750 align:start position:0%
large volumes of audience
um

05:10:45.750 --> 05:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:10:48.708 --> 05:10:48.718 align:start position:0%
but i can hit them up two people i think
 
05:10:50.230 --> 05:10:50.240 align:start position:0%
that some of us are going to want to
 
05:10:52.788 --> 05:10:52.798 align:start position:0%
look at them before we make a
 
05:10:55.030 --> 05:10:55.040 align:start position:0%
final decision on what to do with this
 
05:10:55.040 --> 05:10:58.470 align:start position:0%
final decision on what to do with this
bill

05:10:58.470 --> 05:10:58.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:05.750 --> 05:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:08.550 --> 05:11:08.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman mr gary
 
05:11:10.868 --> 05:11:10.878 align:start position:0%
do you um
 
05:11:12.948 --> 05:11:12.958 align:start position:0%
does the dira determine whether any of
 
05:11:12.958 --> 05:11:13.910 align:start position:0%
does the dira determine whether any of
these

05:11:13.910 --> 05:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
these
 
05:11:16.550 --> 05:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
or is it your purview to determine
 
05:11:18.708 --> 05:11:18.718 align:start position:0%
whether any of these
 
05:11:21.110 --> 05:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
issues are criminal
 
05:11:23.510 --> 05:11:23.520 align:start position:0%
or just
 
05:11:25.750 --> 05:11:25.760 align:start position:0%
a lack of knowledge on
 
05:11:27.590 --> 05:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
on the
 
05:11:29.270 --> 05:11:29.280 align:start position:0%
part of the people
 
05:11:29.280 --> 05:11:30.230 align:start position:0%
part of the people
who've

05:11:30.230 --> 05:11:30.240 align:start position:0%
who've
 
05:11:31.910 --> 05:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
put themselves in place in the
 
05:11:35.750 --> 05:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:36.788 --> 05:11:36.798 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you thank you for your
 
05:11:39.750 --> 05:11:39.760 align:start position:0%
question uh we only determine
 
05:11:39.760 --> 05:11:40.550 align:start position:0%
question uh we only determine
what

05:11:40.550 --> 05:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
what
 
05:11:44.470 --> 05:11:44.480 align:start position:0%
uh violates the laws that we deal with
 
05:11:46.070 --> 05:11:46.080 align:start position:0%
which is mainly the municipal budget act
 
05:11:47.830 --> 05:11:47.840 align:start position:0%
the missile finance act
 
05:11:50.390 --> 05:11:50.400 align:start position:0%
and let's say 41. we do not assign
 
05:11:53.030 --> 05:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
criminality to that that would be
 
05:11:54.868 --> 05:11:54.878 align:start position:0%
the department of justice that would
 
05:11:56.150 --> 05:11:56.160 align:start position:0%
would handle that that is not something
 
05:11:59.030 --> 05:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
the dra is involved with
 
05:12:00.628 --> 05:12:00.638 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:12:03.990 --> 05:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
05:12:05.670 --> 05:12:05.680 align:start position:0%

05:12:33.430 --> 05:12:33.440 align:start position:0%
mr chairman you you were blocked as far
 
05:12:36.070 --> 05:12:36.080 align:start position:0%

willing to give you a second shot at the
apple

apple
 
05:12:49.670 --> 05:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
um but very very briefly
 
05:12:51.190 --> 05:12:51.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and i appreciate
 
05:12:52.310 --> 05:12:52.320 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
05:12:53.670 --> 05:12:53.680 align:start position:0%
the indulgence
 
05:12:53.680 --> 05:12:54.830 align:start position:0%
the indulgence
very

05:12:54.830 --> 05:12:54.840 align:start position:0%
very
 
05:12:57.590 --> 05:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
quickly here you are as a state
 
05:13:00.070 --> 05:13:00.080 align:start position:0%
legislative committee
 
05:13:00.080 --> 05:13:01.030 align:start position:0%
legislative committee
okay

05:13:01.030 --> 05:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:13:03.670 --> 05:13:03.680 align:start position:0%
digging into details of what is clearly
 
05:13:05.990 --> 05:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
a local matter
 
05:13:07.590 --> 05:13:07.600 align:start position:0%
and the point i'm trying to make and
 
05:13:10.070 --> 05:13:10.080 align:start position:0%
asking you to support
 
05:13:12.230 --> 05:13:12.240 align:start position:0%
senate bill 26
 
05:13:13.750 --> 05:13:13.760 align:start position:0%
is this is not where this committee
 
05:13:16.070 --> 05:13:16.080 align:start position:0%
belongs this is not a state issue of
 
05:13:17.830 --> 05:13:17.840 align:start position:0%
funding it's not a state issue of
 
05:13:20.628 --> 05:13:20.638 align:start position:0%
transportation or public works
 
05:13:23.110 --> 05:13:23.120 align:start position:0%
the legislature has no place here
 
05:13:24.868 --> 05:13:24.878 align:start position:0%
passing this law
 
05:13:26.550 --> 05:13:26.560 align:start position:0%
will harm nothing
 
05:13:28.788 --> 05:13:28.798 align:start position:0%
it will in fact facilitate moving
 
05:13:28.798 --> 05:13:30.470 align:start position:0%
it will in fact facilitate moving
forward

05:13:30.470 --> 05:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
forward
 
05:13:32.150 --> 05:13:32.160 align:start position:0%
because at that point
 
05:13:34.310 --> 05:13:34.320 align:start position:0%
there will be no state law
 
05:13:36.788 --> 05:13:36.798 align:start position:0%
preempting the ability of local agencies
 
05:13:38.948 --> 05:13:38.958 align:start position:0%
to move forward and having to bring this
 
05:13:41.430 --> 05:13:41.440 align:start position:0%
before a state legislature whose duties
 
05:13:44.550 --> 05:13:44.560 align:start position:0%
are to the state and not to the if you
 
05:13:44.560 --> 05:13:45.830 align:start position:0%
are to the state and not to the if you
will

05:13:45.830 --> 05:13:45.840 align:start position:0%
will
 
05:13:45.840 --> 05:13:48.310 align:start position:0%
will
assessing

05:13:48.310 --> 05:13:48.320 align:start position:0%
assessing
 
05:13:49.750 --> 05:13:49.760 align:start position:0%
funding requirements on local
 
05:13:51.510 --> 05:13:51.520 align:start position:0%
communities for the sake of other local
 
05:13:51.520 --> 05:13:52.708 align:start position:0%
communities for the sake of other local
communities

05:13:52.708 --> 05:13:52.718 align:start position:0%
communities
 
05:13:55.270 --> 05:13:55.280 align:start position:0%
so with great respect for the duties
 
05:13:56.868 --> 05:13:56.878 align:start position:0%
that you fulfill in covering our state's
 
05:13:56.878 --> 05:13:58.470 align:start position:0%
that you fulfill in covering our state's
highways

05:13:58.470 --> 05:13:58.480 align:start position:0%
highways
 
05:14:00.788 --> 05:14:00.798 align:start position:0%
this is a law that needs to go away so
 
05:14:02.628 --> 05:14:02.638 align:start position:0%
that the problem can in fact be solved
 
05:14:04.470 --> 05:14:04.480 align:start position:0%
in the words of representative lad
 
05:14:08.070 --> 05:14:08.080 align:start position:0%
dealing with this since 2004
 
05:14:10.708 --> 05:14:10.718 align:start position:0%
trying to change it can't happen
 
05:14:11.990 --> 05:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
trying to change or alter that
 
05:14:13.910 --> 05:14:13.920 align:start position:0%
relationship cannot happen
 
05:14:16.470 --> 05:14:16.480 align:start position:0%
with this statute in place as it is
 
05:14:19.350 --> 05:14:19.360 align:start position:0%
hence the origin of senate bill 26 the
 
05:14:22.070 --> 05:14:22.080 align:start position:0%
passage of which will in fact enable
 
05:14:23.590 --> 05:14:23.600 align:start position:0%
the communities to work forward
 
05:14:25.830 --> 05:14:25.840 align:start position:0%
constructively with no blockade
 
05:14:27.990 --> 05:14:28.000 align:start position:0%
established by state law thank you mr
 
05:14:28.000 --> 05:14:32.470 align:start position:0%
established by state law thank you mr
chairman

05:14:32.470 --> 05:14:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:35.030 --> 05:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr thank you senator
 
05:14:37.670 --> 05:14:37.680 align:start position:0%
um you said that there really is no
 
05:14:39.670 --> 05:14:39.680 align:start position:0%
role for the state here but
 
05:14:43.030 --> 05:14:43.040 align:start position:0%
one of the things we heard was that uh
 
05:14:46.310 --> 05:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
a source of the conflict is how state
 
05:14:47.670 --> 05:14:47.680 align:start position:0%
highway fund
 
05:14:49.350 --> 05:14:49.360 align:start position:0%
revenue sharing to
 
05:14:50.948 --> 05:14:50.958 align:start position:0%
to haverhill get split up among the
 
05:14:52.390 --> 05:14:52.400 align:start position:0%
different towns and
 
05:14:54.948 --> 05:14:54.958 align:start position:0%
at different precincts and um
 
05:14:56.470 --> 05:14:56.480 align:start position:0%
that does seem to be
 
05:14:57.830 --> 05:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
a state issue and one of the ones that
 
05:14:59.030 --> 05:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
we certainly dealt with in this
 
05:14:59.040 --> 05:15:01.030 align:start position:0%
we certainly dealt with in this
committee

05:15:01.030 --> 05:15:01.040 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:15:02.948 --> 05:15:02.958 align:start position:0%
the you know the the local tax portion
 
05:15:04.708 --> 05:15:04.718 align:start position:0%
of it
 
05:15:08.310 --> 05:15:08.320 align:start position:0%
i i think it's just a wash i mean if uh
 
05:15:09.910 --> 05:15:09.920 align:start position:0%
if haverhill wants to take their money
 
05:15:09.920 --> 05:15:10.550 align:start position:0%
if haverhill wants to take their money
and

05:15:10.550 --> 05:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:15:12.070 --> 05:15:12.080 align:start position:0%
with villa takes their money then you
 
05:15:13.750 --> 05:15:13.760 align:start position:0%
know that's
 
05:15:16.788 --> 05:15:16.798 align:start position:0%
that's how this village uh precinct
 
05:15:18.868 --> 05:15:18.878 align:start position:0%
system works
 
05:15:20.070 --> 05:15:20.080 align:start position:0%
really is no change there the only
 
05:15:21.510 --> 05:15:21.520 align:start position:0%
change is how they deal with the money
 
05:15:23.350 --> 05:15:23.360 align:start position:0%
that comes from the state
 
05:15:25.990 --> 05:15:26.000 align:start position:0%
with all due respect representative
 
05:15:27.590 --> 05:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
that is not correct
 
05:15:29.750 --> 05:15:29.760 align:start position:0%
the highway block grant money is in fact
 
05:15:31.590 --> 05:15:31.600 align:start position:0%
distributed fully in accord with state
 
05:15:34.230 --> 05:15:34.240 align:start position:0%
law the percentages based on population
 
05:15:36.550 --> 05:15:36.560 align:start position:0%
and so forth mileage there is no change
 
05:15:37.990 --> 05:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
that this in no way impacts the
 
05:15:40.230 --> 05:15:40.240 align:start position:0%
distribution of the hobby block grant
 
05:15:43.190 --> 05:15:43.200 align:start position:0%
this bill only impacts and requires
 
05:15:45.510 --> 05:15:45.520 align:start position:0%
raising and appropriating local funds by
 
05:15:48.470 --> 05:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
one community and requiring by state law
 
05:15:49.990 --> 05:15:50.000 align:start position:0%
that those funds be given to another
 
05:15:50.000 --> 05:15:51.430 align:start position:0%
that those funds be given to another
community

05:15:51.430 --> 05:15:51.440 align:start position:0%
community
 
05:15:53.590 --> 05:15:53.600 align:start position:0%
so there's no impact whatsoever on the
 
05:15:56.948 --> 05:15:56.958 align:start position:0%
highway block grants thank you
 
05:16:01.190 --> 05:16:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:03.750 --> 05:16:03.760 align:start position:0%
i have no other hands raised for anybody
 
05:16:05.670 --> 05:16:05.680 align:start position:0%
wishing to speak
 
05:16:05.680 --> 05:16:06.708 align:start position:0%
wishing to speak
um

05:16:06.708 --> 05:16:06.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:16:09.830 --> 05:16:09.840 align:start position:0%
i will close the public hearing on
 
05:16:09.840 --> 05:16:10.830 align:start position:0%
i will close the public hearing on
senate

05:16:10.830 --> 05:16:10.840 align:start position:0%
senate
 
05:16:13.350 --> 05:16:13.360 align:start position:0%
bill 6.
 
05:16:13.360 --> 05:16:15.830 align:start position:0%
bill 6.
um

05:16:15.830 --> 05:16:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:17.910 --> 05:16:17.920 align:start position:0%
thank everybody for sticking around for
 
05:16:20.230 --> 05:16:20.240 align:start position:0%
two hours of testimony
 
05:16:22.708 --> 05:16:22.718 align:start position:0%
as as many of you know i had hoped to
 
05:16:25.430 --> 05:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
execute this bill today
 
05:16:25.440 --> 05:16:26.550 align:start position:0%
execute this bill today
however

05:16:26.550 --> 05:16:26.560 align:start position:0%
however
 
05:16:29.030 --> 05:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
given the fact that i've asked for the
 
05:16:29.040 --> 05:16:29.990 align:start position:0%
given the fact that i've asked for the
audit

05:16:29.990 --> 05:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
audit
 
05:16:31.990 --> 05:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
to forward it to us
 
05:16:34.550 --> 05:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
um jennifer butcher had a lot of
 
05:16:37.190 --> 05:16:37.200 align:start position:0%
statistics she was going to send us
 
05:16:37.200 --> 05:16:38.868 align:start position:0%
statistics she was going to send us
uh

05:16:38.868 --> 05:16:38.878 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:16:42.868 --> 05:16:42.878 align:start position:0%
mr clay and mr shelton both had said
 
05:16:44.070 --> 05:16:44.080 align:start position:0%
they were going to send a written
 
05:16:47.030 --> 05:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
testimony i think that we need to take
 
05:16:48.708 --> 05:16:48.718 align:start position:0%
some time
 
05:16:51.510 --> 05:16:51.520 align:start position:0%
look through all of this information
 
05:16:54.470 --> 05:16:54.480 align:start position:0%
before we make a final decision rather
 
05:16:56.788 --> 05:16:56.798 align:start position:0%
than jump into it today
 
05:16:56.798 --> 05:16:58.070 align:start position:0%
than jump into it today
um

05:16:58.070 --> 05:16:58.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:17:00.788 --> 05:17:00.798 align:start position:0%
i know some of us are probably ready
 
05:17:03.110 --> 05:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
to say let's finish this and get it over
 
05:17:06.150 --> 05:17:06.160 align:start position:0%
with but i think we need to do it right
 
05:17:06.160 --> 05:17:07.430 align:start position:0%
with but i think we need to do it right
um

05:17:07.430 --> 05:17:07.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:17:07.440 --> 05:17:09.350 align:start position:0%
um
our

05:17:09.350 --> 05:17:09.360 align:start position:0%
our
 
05:17:13.030 --> 05:17:13.040 align:start position:0%
um executive session on this bill
 
05:17:15.510 --> 05:17:15.520 align:start position:0%
will be on the night wednesday the 19th
 
05:17:18.310 --> 05:17:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:21.030 --> 05:17:21.040 align:start position:0%
it will be in the hybrid
 
05:17:21.040 --> 05:17:22.628 align:start position:0%
it will be in the hybrid
situation

05:17:22.628 --> 05:17:22.638 align:start position:0%
situation
 
05:17:22.638 --> 05:17:23.430 align:start position:0%
situation
um

05:17:23.430 --> 05:17:23.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:17:25.750 --> 05:17:25.760 align:start position:0%
i will work with the
 
05:17:28.868 --> 05:17:28.878 align:start position:0%
uh ranking member on a good time whether
 
05:17:31.110 --> 05:17:31.120 align:start position:0%
it's morning or afternoon okay and we'll
 
05:17:33.030 --> 05:17:33.040 align:start position:0%
talk about i was just asking
 
05:17:33.040 --> 05:17:34.150 align:start position:0%
talk about i was just asking
um

05:17:34.150 --> 05:17:34.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:17:37.590 --> 05:17:37.600 align:start position:0%
so i think that it will remove all of us
 
05:17:39.670 --> 05:17:39.680 align:start position:0%
to look through all of the information
 
05:17:41.430 --> 05:17:41.440 align:start position:0%
we already have
 
05:17:43.670 --> 05:17:43.680 align:start position:0%
look through some of the history and
 
05:17:45.190 --> 05:17:45.200 align:start position:0%
look through the information that will
 
05:17:46.788 --> 05:17:46.798 align:start position:0%
be forthcoming
 
05:17:49.510 --> 05:17:49.520 align:start position:0%
i think that in order to do that we'll
 
05:17:51.670 --> 05:17:51.680 align:start position:0%
come to the right decision
 
05:17:52.868 --> 05:17:52.878 align:start position:0%
and again
 
05:17:55.270 --> 05:17:55.280 align:start position:0%
we will have four choices
 
05:17:56.150 --> 05:17:56.160 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:17:57.830 --> 05:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
pass it kill it
 
05:17:59.670 --> 05:17:59.680 align:start position:0%
amend it or
 
05:18:01.750 --> 05:18:01.760 align:start position:0%
retain it work on it for the next few
 
05:18:03.190 --> 05:18:03.200 align:start position:0%
weeks a
 
05:18:05.430 --> 05:18:05.440 align:start position:0%
few months so
 
05:18:07.510 --> 05:18:07.520 align:start position:0%
that those are the options that we will
 
05:18:10.150 --> 05:18:10.160 align:start position:0%
look at on the night
 
05:18:11.990 --> 05:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
representative people's hand up as
 
05:18:12.000 --> 05:18:12.948 align:start position:0%
representative people's hand up as
always

05:18:12.948 --> 05:18:12.958 align:start position:0%
always
 
05:18:12.958 --> 05:18:14.470 align:start position:0%
always
oh

05:18:14.470 --> 05:18:14.480 align:start position:0%
oh
 
05:18:16.868 --> 05:18:16.878 align:start position:0%
um i wondered if representative ladd
 
05:18:20.390 --> 05:18:20.400 align:start position:0%
could share the research that he had ols
 
05:18:23.910 --> 05:18:23.920 align:start position:0%
do for him on the legislative history
 
05:18:23.920 --> 05:18:24.788 align:start position:0%
do for him on the legislative history
um

05:18:24.788 --> 05:18:24.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:18:26.788 --> 05:18:26.798 align:start position:0%
you can find his email and ask him for
 
05:18:26.798 --> 05:18:27.670 align:start position:0%
you can find his email and ask him for
it

05:18:27.670 --> 05:18:27.680 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:18:27.680 --> 05:18:28.470 align:start position:0%
it
okay

05:18:28.470 --> 05:18:28.480 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:18:28.480 --> 05:18:30.470 align:start position:0%
okay

05:18:42.230 --> 05:18:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:44.150 --> 05:18:44.160 align:start position:0%

05:18:56.310 --> 05:18:56.320 align:start position:0%
distribute it to your committee
 
05:19:00.150 --> 05:19:00.160 align:start position:0%
um also in regard to the litigation uh
 
05:19:01.670 --> 05:19:01.680 align:start position:0%
the i i'm not
 
05:19:03.750 --> 05:19:03.760 align:start position:0%
really part of this anymore however i
 
05:19:06.150 --> 05:19:06.160 align:start position:0%
can tell you that there's a sizable
 
05:19:08.230 --> 05:19:08.240 align:start position:0%
amount of dollar that's being spent by
 
05:19:10.310 --> 05:19:10.320 align:start position:0%
both parties on this and
 
05:19:12.230 --> 05:19:12.240 align:start position:0%
of course
 
05:19:14.708 --> 05:19:14.718 align:start position:0%
we finished the hearing on this bill i
 
05:19:16.230 --> 05:19:16.240 align:start position:0%
don't want to get too much
 
05:19:19.270 --> 05:19:19.280 align:start position:0%
in depth on things that were said
 
05:19:21.190 --> 05:19:21.200 align:start position:0%
in the uh
 
05:19:23.110 --> 05:19:23.120 align:start position:0%
in the hearing and because we're not in
 
05:19:25.830 --> 05:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
executive session either so
 
05:19:28.948 --> 05:19:28.958 align:start position:0%
we're kind of outside the realms of our
 
05:19:31.590 --> 05:19:31.600 align:start position:0%
boundaries here uh what we should or
 
05:19:34.708 --> 05:19:34.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:36.788 --> 05:19:36.798 align:start position:0%
but the request for
 
05:19:39.190 --> 05:19:39.200 align:start position:0%
the um
 
05:19:44.470 --> 05:19:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:44.480 --> 05:19:45.830 align:start position:0%
 
any

05:19:45.830 --> 05:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
any
 
05:19:47.750 --> 05:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
thing else from any members of the
 
05:19:47.760 --> 05:19:48.788 align:start position:0%
thing else from any members of the
committee

05:19:48.788 --> 05:19:48.798 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:19:51.670 --> 05:19:51.680 align:start position:0%
on what the way forward is
 
05:19:53.830 --> 05:19:53.840 align:start position:0%
this is one thing representative i
 
05:19:55.590 --> 05:19:55.600 align:start position:0%
hardly concur with your decision i think
 
05:19:57.910 --> 05:19:57.920 align:start position:0%
we need to take our time on this this
 
05:19:59.670 --> 05:19:59.680 align:start position:0%
i just wouldn't want to i don't think
 
05:20:01.430 --> 05:20:01.440 align:start position:0%
i'd make a good decision today if i hit
 
05:20:02.868 --> 05:20:02.878 align:start position:0%
the phone
 
05:20:05.510 --> 05:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
our decisions are always good okay yeah
 
05:20:08.948 --> 05:20:08.958 align:start position:0%
i i'm just speaking for myself
 
05:20:10.948 --> 05:20:10.958 align:start position:0%
but i think that there's a lot of head
 
05:20:12.628 --> 05:20:12.638 align:start position:0%
shaking that i think a lot of people
 
05:20:14.070 --> 05:20:14.080 align:start position:0%
want to look at
 
05:20:14.080 --> 05:20:15.030 align:start position:0%
want to look at
um

05:20:15.030 --> 05:20:15.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:20:17.590 --> 05:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
do our due diligence to make sure we've
 
05:20:19.510 --> 05:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
come to the right decision
 
05:20:19.520 --> 05:20:20.868 align:start position:0%
come to the right decision
um

05:20:20.868 --> 05:20:20.878 align:start position:0%

05:20:25.190 --> 05:20:25.200 align:start position:0%

05:20:27.990 --> 05:20:28.000 align:start position:0%
whatever impetus there is for for this
 
05:20:32.470 --> 05:20:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:35.030 --> 05:20:35.040 align:start position:0%
