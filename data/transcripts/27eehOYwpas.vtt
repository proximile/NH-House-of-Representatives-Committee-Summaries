only have one pink card for this so if
 
00:08:14.089 --> 00:08:14.099 align:start position:0%
anybody else wishes to speak on this uh
 
00:08:17.589 --> 00:08:17.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:19.800 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I mean it's not just
 
00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:21.960 align:start position:0%
my bill I've got several co-sponsors on
 
00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:24.960 align:start position:0%
it but um I've uh and it's been around
 
00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:27.000 align:start position:0%
the block a few times there's uh your
 
00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:28.680 align:start position:0%
community researcher has a excellent
 
00:08:30.589 --> 00:08:30.599 align:start position:0%
memo which I uh
 
00:08:31.969 --> 00:08:31.979 align:start position:0%
which has a lot of good information
 
00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:34.440 align:start position:0%
about it um
 
00:08:36.829 --> 00:08:36.839 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:08:38.930 --> 00:08:38.940 align:start position:0%
first of all I guess one of the people
 
00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:40.860 align:start position:0%
submitted testimony
 
00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:41.690 align:start position:0%
submitted testimony
um

00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:41.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:43.320 align:start position:0%
so I don't know if he's the other pink
 
00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:45.720 align:start position:0%
card uh there's he went on and on a lot
 
00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:47.880 align:start position:0%
a lot about made up a lot of stuff about
 
00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:49.980 align:start position:0%
the definition of residency which wasn't
 
00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:52.440 align:start position:0%
true but um you can worry about that
 
00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:53.329 align:start position:0%
true but um you can worry about that
later

00:08:53.329 --> 00:08:53.339 align:start position:0%
later
 
00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:55.320 align:start position:0%
um the definitions of residency is
 
00:08:58.310 --> 00:08:58.320 align:start position:0%
fairly is uh fairly simple as the memo
 
00:09:00.949 --> 00:09:00.959 align:start position:0%
explains and this bill would make a uh
 
00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:02.880 align:start position:0%
minor changes definitely there's a
 
00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:05.180 align:start position:0%
residency which uh
 
00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:07.620 align:start position:0%
hasn't in practice made a major
 
00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:09.240 align:start position:0%
difference one way or the other because
 
00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:12.480 align:start position:0%
they we I'm putting it okay so anyway so
 
00:09:15.009 --> 00:09:15.019 align:start position:0%
it's essentially identical to hpe 538
 
00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:17.580 align:start position:0%
2021 which came before the election law
 
00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:20.760 align:start position:0%
committee two years ago and that was uh
 
00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:24.300 align:start position:0%
deemed itl by a narrow tendinite margin
 
00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:26.760 align:start position:0%
on March 30th 2021 that was the year
 
00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:28.320 align:start position:0%
that we were
 
00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:29.880 align:start position:0%
that was the spring that we were having
 
00:09:32.449 --> 00:09:32.459 align:start position:0%
our uh
 
00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:34.740 align:start position:0%
Full House sessions at the Sportsplex in
 
00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:35.870 align:start position:0%
Full House sessions at the Sportsplex in
Merrimack

00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:35.880 align:start position:0%
Merrimack
 
00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:36.590 align:start position:0%
Merrimack
um

00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:36.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:38.509 --> 00:09:38.519 align:start position:0%
and that was one of several dozen bills
 
00:09:39.949 --> 00:09:39.959 align:start position:0%
all of them it out in committee which
 
00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:41.820 align:start position:0%
never got a floor vote which kind of
 
00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
violated house rules and president
 
00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:45.060 align:start position:0%
because supposedly
 
00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:48.600 align:start position:0%
every Bill gets a vote on the floor but
 
00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:49.190 align:start position:0%
every Bill gets a vote on the floor but
um

00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:49.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:51.000 align:start position:0%
you know I
 
00:09:53.329 --> 00:09:53.339 align:start position:0%
could have brought it back in 2022 but I
 
00:09:55.009 --> 00:09:55.019 align:start position:0%
decided to wait decided not to do it
 
00:09:57.350 --> 00:09:57.360 align:start position:0%
last year but I'm back um with it this
 
00:09:59.930 --> 00:09:59.940 align:start position:0%
year because
 
00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:01.500 align:start position:0%
um essentially the reason it didn't go
 
00:10:03.829 --> 00:10:03.839 align:start position:0%
the floor is all the bills were they
 
00:10:05.329 --> 00:10:05.339 align:start position:0%
pulled out a few of the bills that were
 
00:10:06.650 --> 00:10:06.660 align:start position:0%
it held in committee which they thought
 
00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:08.760 align:start position:0%
might be overturned and all the ones
 
00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
which were unlike to be overturned were
 
00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:13.080 align:start position:0%
just never voted on which uh
 
00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
kind of irregular but that was a strange
 
00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
time and so no hard feelings about that
 
00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:19.680 align:start position:0%
so here I am again with it
 
00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:21.540 align:start position:0%
it's also a combination of two bills
 
00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:23.940 align:start position:0%
which I sponsored which many co-sponsors
 
00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:26.040 align:start position:0%
uh well
 
00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
and I've got several this year in 2019
 
00:10:31.009 --> 00:10:31.019 align:start position:0%
they both past the House and Senate them
 
00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:34.380 align:start position:0%
being vetoed by governor sununu and then
 
00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:35.630 align:start position:0%
being vetoed by governor sununu and then
um

00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:35.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:38.220 align:start position:0%
one of those two bills HP 106 also
 
00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:39.420 align:start position:0%
covered the same ground so Senate bill
 
00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
which the government the same governor
 
00:10:44.389 --> 00:10:44.399 align:start position:0%
also vetoed so it's uh in that part of
 
00:10:46.009 --> 00:10:46.019 align:start position:0%
the bill is at the end of the very long
 
00:10:48.590 --> 00:10:48.600 align:start position:0%
bill before the committee today it's uh
 
00:10:53.509 --> 00:10:53.519 align:start position:0%
covered by section section 16 out of 18.
 
00:10:55.970 --> 00:10:55.980 align:start position:0%
and um actually that's a good thing to
 
00:10:58.130 --> 00:10:58.140 align:start position:0%
refer to just to uh refresh your
 
00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:00.240 align:start position:0%
memories on the definition of residence
 
00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:03.000 align:start position:0%
which regardless of whether existing law
 
00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
applies or whether we put the minor
 
00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
change I'm proposing
 
00:11:09.769 --> 00:11:09.779 align:start position:0%
in this bill either way it's a very
 
00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
simple definition which is much simpler
 
00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.970 align:start position:0%
simple definition which is much simpler
than

00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:13.980 align:start position:0%
than
 
00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
what you may hear from opponents of the
 
00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:18.660 align:start position:0%
bill if any step four if there are even
 
00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
going to be any here in the committee
 
00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:22.380 align:start position:0%
room today so you know it's uh
 
00:11:24.769 --> 00:11:24.779 align:start position:0%
it's a very uh you know it's a much
 
00:11:26.269 --> 00:11:26.279 align:start position:0%
simpler concept
 
00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
um it's a common word that obviously
 
00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
everybody it's a common word but it's a
 
00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:31.800 align:start position:0%
much simpler meaning legally than people
 
00:11:36.610 --> 00:11:36.620 align:start position:0%
sometimes try to say it is so that's um
 
00:11:39.850 --> 00:11:39.860 align:start position:0%
basically so anyway so it's
 
00:11:44.329 --> 00:11:44.339 align:start position:0%
I perceive it and rightly or wrongly but
 
00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:46.500 align:start position:0%
um others do perceive it as a uh being
 
00:11:48.290 --> 00:11:48.300 align:start position:0%
especially uh
 
00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:49.680 align:start position:0%
being especially directed against
 
00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:51.720 align:start position:0%
college students and their right to vote
 
00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
which they have like any other citizen
 
00:11:55.009 --> 00:11:55.019 align:start position:0%
they're not the only voters who are
 
00:11:56.870 --> 00:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
adversely affected by the chances of
 
00:11:58.370 --> 00:11:58.380 align:start position:0%
voting rights to law which we're trying
 
00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:00.360 align:start position:0%
to undo
 
00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:03.000 align:start position:0%
but um and the basically the bottom line
 
00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:03.889 align:start position:0%
but um and the basically the bottom line
is

00:12:03.889 --> 00:12:03.899 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:06.420 align:start position:0%
every citizen over the age of 18 has the
 
00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:07.740 align:start position:0%
right to vote in the community where he
 
00:12:10.190 --> 00:12:10.200 align:start position:0%
or she lives regardless of why he or she
 
00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
moved there and regardless of how long
 
00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
it goes that's pretty clear even in
 
00:12:15.889 --> 00:12:15.899 align:start position:0%
existing law it'll be even clearer if
 
00:12:18.290 --> 00:12:18.300 align:start position:0%
you pass this bill
 
00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:20.760 align:start position:0%
and um it's also guaranteed by federal
 
00:12:22.490 --> 00:12:22.500 align:start position:0%
voting rights law the U.S and state
 
00:12:26.389 --> 00:12:26.399 align:start position:0%
constitutions etc etc so that's um
 
00:12:28.370 --> 00:12:28.380 align:start position:0%
and uh but I'll quote our state
 
00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:31.200 align:start position:0%
constitution it says
 
00:12:33.650 --> 00:12:33.660 align:start position:0%
um this is part of article 11
 
00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:35.880 align:start position:0%
part one it says all elections are to be
 
00:12:37.970 --> 00:12:37.980 align:start position:0%
free and every inhabited estate 18 years
 
00:12:39.949 --> 00:12:39.959 align:start position:0%
of age and upwards shall have an equal
 
00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:42.300 align:start position:0%
right to vote in any election every
 
00:12:44.269 --> 00:12:44.279 align:start position:0%
person shall be considered an inhabitant
 
00:12:46.670 --> 00:12:46.680 align:start position:0%
for the purposes of voting the town Ward
 
00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:48.360 align:start position:0%
or unincorporated place where he has a
 
00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:51.000 align:start position:0%
stone missile and if you by the
 
00:12:53.629 --> 00:12:53.639 align:start position:0%
definition of residence domicile
 
00:12:53.639 --> 00:12:54.290 align:start position:0%
definition of residence domicile
um

00:12:54.290 --> 00:12:54.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:56.569 --> 00:12:56.579 align:start position:0%
anybody who's anybody is physically
 
00:12:58.730 --> 00:12:58.740 align:start position:0%
present in the town most of the year
 
00:13:01.129 --> 00:13:01.139 align:start position:0%
is a residence and they claim down the
 
00:13:02.449 --> 00:13:02.459 align:start position:0%
domicile and there's also certain
 
00:13:04.670 --> 00:13:04.680 align:start position:0%
exceptions uh
 
00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:08.160 align:start position:0%
where somebody who's temporarily at
 
00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:09.720 align:start position:0%
least in their view temporarily away not
 
00:13:11.569 --> 00:13:11.579 align:start position:0%
that anybody knows how temporary how
 
00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:13.620 align:start position:0%
permanent their current residence is but
 
00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:14.990 align:start position:0%
permanent their current residence is but
um anybody

00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:15.000 align:start position:0%
um anybody
 
00:13:17.389 --> 00:13:17.399 align:start position:0%
you know so anyway so students college
 
00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:19.200 align:start position:0%
students particular and others who may
 
00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:21.240 align:start position:0%
be considered uh not as permanent as
 
00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
other residents they're still they're
 
00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:24.600 align:start position:0%
still there they're still
 
00:13:26.210 --> 00:13:26.220 align:start position:0%
living in the community that's still
 
00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:27.480 align:start position:0%
physically president they're still
 
00:13:29.030 --> 00:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
paying taxes in most place they're
 
00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:30.720 align:start position:0%
working in the community
 
00:13:32.269 --> 00:13:32.279 align:start position:0%
et cetera et cetera so everything that
 
00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:34.380 align:start position:0%
applies to a non-student applies to a
 
00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:36.240 align:start position:0%
college student and
 
00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:37.680 align:start position:0%
and of course there are others military
 
00:13:39.889 --> 00:13:39.899 align:start position:0%
personnel uh
 
00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:42.540 align:start position:0%
military personnel people who maybe are
 
00:13:44.569 --> 00:13:44.579 align:start position:0%
holding down come here to hold down temp
 
00:13:47.269 --> 00:13:47.279 align:start position:0%
jobs and may or may not uh get permanent
 
00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:49.800 align:start position:0%
jobs out of it etc etc
 
00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:50.509 align:start position:0%
jobs out of it etc etc
um

00:13:50.509 --> 00:13:50.519 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:52.850 --> 00:13:52.860 align:start position:0%
so any residents of that sort
 
00:13:54.530 --> 00:13:54.540 align:start position:0%
they have the right to vote in the place
 
00:13:56.930 --> 00:13:56.940 align:start position:0%
where they're living and so that's
 
00:13:58.670 --> 00:13:58.680 align:start position:0%
basically what my bill is about we're
 
00:14:00.290 --> 00:14:00.300 align:start position:0%
just trying to uh
 
00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
we're just trying to put the voting law
 
00:14:04.069 --> 00:14:04.079 align:start position:0%
the back it was before certain I think
 
00:14:07.490 --> 00:14:07.500 align:start position:0%
unwise changes were made back in uh
 
00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:09.720 align:start position:0%
starting about 2012 and there actually
 
00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:10.860 align:start position:0%
is a
 
00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:12.540 align:start position:0%
Senate bill which covers some of the
 
00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
same ground which uh passed the senate
 
00:14:17.269 --> 00:14:17.279 align:start position:0%
election law committee unanimously which
 
00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:19.680 align:start position:0%
has that's a group of five Senators who
 
00:14:21.710 --> 00:14:21.720 align:start position:0%
have a very wide view of uh views and
 
00:14:24.410 --> 00:14:24.420 align:start position:0%
it's on the consent calendar so
 
00:14:26.329 --> 00:14:26.339 align:start position:0%
not that we talk maybe I'm not supposed
 
00:14:27.530 --> 00:14:27.540 align:start position:0%
to talk about what goes on the other
 
00:14:29.090 --> 00:14:29.100 align:start position:0%
side of the wall but like some of the
 
00:14:31.129 --> 00:14:31.139 align:start position:0%
there's going to be changes in this area
 
00:14:33.650 --> 00:14:33.660 align:start position:0%
anyway so but I think
 
00:14:36.050 --> 00:14:36.060 align:start position:0%
this bill I think is a complete set of
 
00:14:38.329 --> 00:14:38.339 align:start position:0%
changes that are needed so
 
00:14:40.009 --> 00:14:40.019 align:start position:0%
with that I'd be happy to take any
 
00:14:40.019 --> 00:14:41.629 align:start position:0%
with that I'd be happy to take any
questions

00:14:41.629 --> 00:14:41.639 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:14:45.189 --> 00:14:45.199 align:start position:0%
from the committee representative Hamlet
 
00:14:49.129 --> 00:14:49.139 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you Miss Mr
 
00:14:55.069 --> 00:14:55.079 align:start position:0%
Horgan thanks so in Section 8 on page 20
 
00:14:57.530 --> 00:14:57.540 align:start position:0%
uh wait down so this is about
 
00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:01.380 align:start position:0%
centralized voter registration database
 
00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:03.420 align:start position:0%
and at the very bottom of the page it
 
00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:05.880 align:start position:0%
says upon the effective date of
 
00:15:08.329 --> 00:15:08.339 align:start position:0%
subparagraph a the Secretary of State
 
00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:10.680 align:start position:0%
shall cease any activity or data
 
00:15:12.250 --> 00:15:12.260 align:start position:0%
transfer with the kansas-based
 
00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:14.220 align:start position:0%
interstate voter registration to
 
00:15:16.009 --> 00:15:16.019 align:start position:0%
cross-check program so that must be the
 
00:15:18.110 --> 00:15:18.120 align:start position:0%
program we're in now
 
00:15:22.189 --> 00:15:22.199 align:start position:0%
so and I don't know very much about that
 
00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:25.680 align:start position:0%
program so this would allow us to
 
00:15:29.050 --> 00:15:29.060 align:start position:0%
uh enroll in in a centralized
 
00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:31.440 align:start position:0%
voter registration database
 
00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
I'm just asking for clarification well
 
00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:37.380 align:start position:0%
my understanding is you may get a clear
 
00:15:39.290 --> 00:15:39.300 align:start position:0%
clarification from the secondary state
 
00:15:41.509 --> 00:15:41.519 align:start position:0%
who's sitting in the front row and
 
00:15:44.389 --> 00:15:44.399 align:start position:0%
probably will be happy to speak
 
00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:46.680 align:start position:0%
um but that was a that was a program
 
00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:49.560 align:start position:0%
that was uh that's a program that's been
 
00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
around for several years which is highly
 
00:15:54.110 --> 00:15:54.120 align:start position:0%
problematic had a lot of false positives
 
00:15:56.449 --> 00:15:56.459 align:start position:0%
and so forth so we're pulling out of
 
00:15:58.310 --> 00:15:58.320 align:start position:0%
that one but if a better one exists we
 
00:16:00.769 --> 00:16:00.779 align:start position:0%
can join that one that's uh
 
00:16:03.889 --> 00:16:03.899 align:start position:0%
at least I was my understanding why I
 
00:16:05.449 --> 00:16:05.459 align:start position:0%
signed off on the bill with that
 
00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:07.620 align:start position:0%
language on there so
 
00:16:10.009 --> 00:16:10.019 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you
 
00:16:11.810 --> 00:16:11.820 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
00:16:13.189 --> 00:16:13.199 align:start position:0%
representative weary
 
00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
thank you chair and thank you
 
00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:17.220 align:start position:0%
representative Morgan
 
00:16:20.810 --> 00:16:20.820 align:start position:0%
um just a couple of questions on page
 
00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:22.370 align:start position:0%
um just a couple of questions on page
five

00:16:22.370 --> 00:16:22.380 align:start position:0%
five
 
00:16:25.310 --> 00:16:25.320 align:start position:0%
and going into page six you talked uh
 
00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:27.480 align:start position:0%
the language that has been added is or
 
00:16:29.449 --> 00:16:29.459 align:start position:0%
to which I intend to return after a
 
00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:31.560 align:start position:0%
temporary absence what what is the
 
00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:33.720 align:start position:0%
temporary absence and do you have a
 
00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:35.940 align:start position:0%
duration for that or what is what's the
 
00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:39.300 align:start position:0%
intent behind that well that's um I mean
 
00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:42.480 align:start position:0%
it's the idea is that a person who has
 
00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:45.720 align:start position:0%
multiple residences as many as do um
 
00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:48.000 align:start position:0%
can have only one of those residences
 
00:16:50.090 --> 00:16:50.100 align:start position:0%
there as their domiciles so in the case
 
00:16:52.129 --> 00:16:52.139 align:start position:0%
of a
 
00:16:53.449 --> 00:16:53.459 align:start position:0%
and we're talking a lot about college
 
00:16:56.030 --> 00:16:56.040 align:start position:0%
students they're a good example they uh
 
00:16:57.769 --> 00:16:57.779 align:start position:0%
some of them vote
 
00:16:59.329 --> 00:16:59.339 align:start position:0%
in their quote unquote back home
 
00:17:01.069 --> 00:17:01.079 align:start position:0%
location and some of them choose to vote
 
00:17:02.210 --> 00:17:02.220 align:start position:0%
in their college town basically
 
00:17:04.010 --> 00:17:04.020 align:start position:0%
depending on where
 
00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
they feel more of a connection to the
 
00:17:07.490 --> 00:17:07.500 align:start position:0%
political activity in that community and
 
00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:09.480 align:start position:0%
I know when I was a college student
 
00:17:11.210 --> 00:17:11.220 align:start position:0%
which was many many years ago as you can
 
00:17:13.370 --> 00:17:13.380 align:start position:0%
tell by my hair color
 
00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
I uh voted when I was in undergraduate I
 
00:17:19.730 --> 00:17:19.740 align:start position:0%
voted here in Durham that is going to
 
00:17:20.929 --> 00:17:20.939 align:start position:0%
school in New York City because
 
00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
partially because my father was a member
 
00:17:24.829 --> 00:17:24.839 align:start position:0%
of the legislature and then when I went
 
00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:27.360 align:start position:0%
off to grad school I
 
00:17:29.210 --> 00:17:29.220 align:start position:0%
did it the other way around I just voted
 
00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:30.720 align:start position:0%
wherever it was I was living while going
 
00:17:33.530 --> 00:17:33.540 align:start position:0%
to school so there are students are one
 
00:17:35.270 --> 00:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
class of Voters on others who have
 
00:17:38.029 --> 00:17:38.039 align:start position:0%
multiple residences and um you know they
 
00:17:40.549 --> 00:17:40.559 align:start position:0%
have the right to choose it's up to them
 
00:17:42.409 --> 00:17:42.419 align:start position:0%
to choose which one is the one they feel
 
00:17:44.810 --> 00:17:44.820 align:start position:0%
is more permanent and more like where
 
00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
they want to be voting and been
 
00:17:49.850 --> 00:17:49.860 align:start position:0%
civically engaged
 
00:17:53.810 --> 00:17:53.820 align:start position:0%
follow-up please thank you um all right
 
00:17:58.190 --> 00:17:58.200 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for that uh explanation
 
00:18:00.650 --> 00:18:00.660 align:start position:0%
um and then on the on the
 
00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:02.520 align:start position:0%
let's see I guess this would be page one
 
00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
where you say a person's claim uh added
 
00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
text in bold there bold italic
 
00:18:11.570 --> 00:18:11.580 align:start position:0%
um a person's claim of dominant lines 10
 
00:18:13.789 --> 00:18:13.799 align:start position:0%
through 12 a person's claim of domicile
 
00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:15.360 align:start position:0%
for voting purposes shall not be
 
00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:17.640 align:start position:0%
conclusive of the person's residence for
 
00:18:21.110 --> 00:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
any other legal purpose isn't isn't that
 
00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:22.620 align:start position:0%
sort of redundant with
 
00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:24.840 align:start position:0%
the wording in the paragraph above or
 
00:18:28.130 --> 00:18:28.140 align:start position:0%
why the additional that was distinctions
 
00:18:29.930 --> 00:18:29.940 align:start position:0%
I mean we're
 
00:18:31.970 --> 00:18:31.980 align:start position:0%
the uh I think that was language that
 
00:18:34.610 --> 00:18:34.620 align:start position:0%
was in that RSA back before we started
 
00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:37.980 align:start position:0%
back before we started trying to uh
 
00:18:40.130 --> 00:18:40.140 align:start position:0%
trying to improve it but trying that was
 
00:18:42.650 --> 00:18:42.660 align:start position:0%
trying to decouple uh your voting Dom
 
00:18:45.350 --> 00:18:45.360 align:start position:0%
LaSalle from things well especially uh
 
00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:49.140 align:start position:0%
like in-state tuition for uh the
 
00:18:51.289 --> 00:18:51.299 align:start position:0%
university and then also just trying to
 
00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:52.740 align:start position:0%
decouple a little bit from things like
 
00:18:56.810 --> 00:18:56.820 align:start position:0%
driver's licenses or so forth so so
 
00:18:59.210 --> 00:18:59.220 align:start position:0%
there's our there are
 
00:19:01.250 --> 00:19:01.260 align:start position:0%
yeah so the end of course our people you
 
00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:02.700 align:start position:0%
have multiple and as I said before it's
 
00:19:04.430 --> 00:19:04.440 align:start position:0%
lots of people have multiple residences
 
00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:06.830 align:start position:0%
lots of people have multiple residences
so

00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:08.690 align:start position:0%
 
representatively

00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:08.700 align:start position:0%
representatively
 
00:19:10.970 --> 00:19:10.980 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
00:19:13.130 --> 00:19:13.140 align:start position:0%
Mr President Horrigan back to the
 
00:19:16.669 --> 00:19:16.679 align:start position:0%
language on page five to six about where
 
00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:19.380 align:start position:0%
which to which I intend to return after
 
00:19:22.909 --> 00:19:22.919 align:start position:0%
a temporary absence my recollection and
 
00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:25.260 align:start position:0%
you and I'm just asking you if this is
 
00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:26.940 align:start position:0%
still correct was that also covered
 
00:19:28.970 --> 00:19:28.980 align:start position:0%
people who like were residences
 
00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:31.440 align:start position:0%
residency who had medical residencies
 
00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
who had to be out of state for a short
 
00:19:36.409 --> 00:19:36.419 align:start position:0%
period of time or whose jobs took them
 
00:19:38.810 --> 00:19:38.820 align:start position:0%
out of state for a time but still wanted
 
00:19:40.730 --> 00:19:40.740 align:start position:0%
to be there yeah exactly yes is that
 
00:19:43.610 --> 00:19:43.620 align:start position:0%
correct yes that's part of it okay and
 
00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:47.640 align:start position:0%
Military personality right and also my
 
00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
understanding would that would have
 
00:19:51.169 --> 00:19:51.179 align:start position:0%
covered people who we affectionately
 
00:19:54.289 --> 00:19:54.299 align:start position:0%
refer to as snowbirds yes okay thank you
 
00:19:55.610 --> 00:19:55.620 align:start position:0%
I just want to make sure that was still
 
00:19:58.490 --> 00:19:58.500 align:start position:0%
yeah okay thanks
 
00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:00.480 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
I do have one um in your testimony you
 
00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:06.480 align:start position:0%
said that this would allow specifically
 
00:20:08.090 --> 00:20:08.100 align:start position:0%
college students to choose where to vote
 
00:20:10.190 --> 00:20:10.200 align:start position:0%
based on their political activity
 
00:20:12.409 --> 00:20:12.419 align:start position:0%
did I misunderstand that
 
00:20:15.289 --> 00:20:15.299 align:start position:0%
you I mean
 
00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
I mean you may be maybe misconstruing a
 
00:20:19.669 --> 00:20:19.679 align:start position:0%
little bit better but like it's anybody
 
00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:21.360 align:start position:0%
and that applies to college students
 
00:20:24.169 --> 00:20:24.179 align:start position:0%
anybody else some of them feel uh you
 
00:20:24.179 --> 00:20:25.190 align:start position:0%
anybody else some of them feel uh you
know

00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:25.200 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:20:27.049 --> 00:20:27.059 align:start position:0%
some of them are more engaged with the
 
00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
community they're living in right then
 
00:20:31.010 --> 00:20:31.020 align:start position:0%
as opposed to the community they came
 
00:20:33.289 --> 00:20:33.299 align:start position:0%
from in which they may or may not return
 
00:20:36.169 --> 00:20:36.179 align:start position:0%
at some point in the future so that's uh
 
00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:38.400 align:start position:0%
yes so they're the same right as anybody
 
00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:40.320 align:start position:0%
else who's done you know domicile or
 
00:20:42.049 --> 00:20:42.059 align:start position:0%
even like say a medical resident of
 
00:20:43.490 --> 00:20:43.500 align:start position:0%
course that's still probably a form of
 
00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:45.480 align:start position:0%
student but like say a medical residents
 
00:20:46.850 --> 00:20:46.860 align:start position:0%
say if they
 
00:20:48.770 --> 00:20:48.780 align:start position:0%
go to say the uh
 
00:20:50.810 --> 00:20:50.820 align:start position:0%
Cornell Medical College in New York and
 
00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
then they get assigned to Dartmouth
 
00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
Health you know they may
 
00:20:55.250 --> 00:20:55.260 align:start position:0%
they may be more interested in what's
 
00:20:57.409 --> 00:20:57.419 align:start position:0%
going on in uh in New Hampshire than
 
00:20:59.810 --> 00:20:59.820 align:start position:0%
they were back like yeah back when they
 
00:21:01.610 --> 00:21:01.620 align:start position:0%
were in New York City at Cornell Medical
 
00:21:04.010 --> 00:21:04.020 align:start position:0%
College or whatever so that's that
 
00:21:06.049 --> 00:21:06.059 align:start position:0%
probably I mean that I would say yes
 
00:21:08.150 --> 00:21:08.160 align:start position:0%
that is probably uh
 
00:21:10.370 --> 00:21:10.380 align:start position:0%
I mean I know like some people may think
 
00:21:12.890 --> 00:21:12.900 align:start position:0%
that's an undesirable thing but yes you
 
00:21:15.230 --> 00:21:15.240 align:start position:0%
you that's true of like the snowbirds
 
00:21:17.090 --> 00:21:17.100 align:start position:0%
too some care more about
 
00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:19.080 align:start position:0%
what's going on up up here in New
 
00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:20.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and so maybe care more about
 
00:21:22.490 --> 00:21:22.500 align:start position:0%
what's going on down in the place in
 
00:21:24.529 --> 00:21:24.539 align:start position:0%
Florida they have like
 
00:21:26.150 --> 00:21:26.160 align:start position:0%
you know they have a certain amount of
 
00:21:27.710 --> 00:21:27.720 align:start position:0%
leeway deciding which one of those two
 
00:21:31.310 --> 00:21:31.320 align:start position:0%
places is there uh is there uh voting
 
00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
domicile so
 
00:21:35.930 --> 00:21:35.940 align:start position:0%
it's any other questions from the
 
00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:39.240 align:start position:0%
committee uh yes representative Bay
 
00:21:40.970 --> 00:21:40.980 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman
 
00:21:43.250 --> 00:21:43.260 align:start position:0%
um thank you for taking my question so
 
00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:46.440 align:start position:0%
this uh bill it it goes both ways right
 
00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:49.440 align:start position:0%
so for example uh I have a college
 
00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:52.500 align:start position:0%
student who chose to go to school in
 
00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:53.510 align:start position:0%
student who chose to go to school in
Hawaii

00:21:53.510 --> 00:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
Hawaii
 
00:21:57.169 --> 00:21:57.179 align:start position:0%
and So based on this bill that she could
 
00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:00.240 align:start position:0%
choose whether she where she has a
 
00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:03.360 align:start position:0%
deeper I guess political connection so I
 
00:22:05.149 --> 00:22:05.159 align:start position:0%
want her to vote here because I want her
 
00:22:07.070 --> 00:22:07.080 align:start position:0%
to vote for me so yes well yeah that's
 
00:22:08.570 --> 00:22:08.580 align:start position:0%
that's legitimate and I have to confess
 
00:22:11.210 --> 00:22:11.220 align:start position:0%
I did the same thing when I had a family
 
00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:13.080 align:start position:0%
member doing the same thing you're doing
 
00:22:16.190 --> 00:22:16.200 align:start position:0%
now like uh years and years ago even
 
00:22:18.830 --> 00:22:18.840 align:start position:0%
though I was certainly also involved in
 
00:22:20.930 --> 00:22:20.940 align:start position:0%
uh political things going on down there
 
00:22:22.430 --> 00:22:22.440 align:start position:0%
in New York city so that's perfectly
 
00:22:24.770 --> 00:22:24.780 align:start position:0%
legitimate and actually
 
00:22:27.289 --> 00:22:27.299 align:start position:0%
this is gratuitous mention of Hawaii but
 
00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:28.440 align:start position:0%
there was a
 
00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
one of the court cases which is
 
00:22:31.610 --> 00:22:31.620 align:start position:0%
mentioned in the memo and which is
 
00:22:34.549 --> 00:22:34.559 align:start position:0%
newberger versus Peterson which was uh
 
00:22:38.029 --> 00:22:38.039 align:start position:0%
50 years ago but it's still like a
 
00:22:40.490 --> 00:22:40.500 align:start position:0%
a important uh
 
00:22:43.730 --> 00:22:43.740 align:start position:0%
important still like uh it's still like
 
00:22:46.250 --> 00:22:46.260 align:start position:0%
a very important case which was um
 
00:22:48.590 --> 00:22:48.600 align:start position:0%
Peterson was Walter Peterson the former
 
00:22:49.909 --> 00:22:49.919 align:start position:0%
who was the Attorney General of New
 
00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:51.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire at the time and was later to
 
00:22:53.270 --> 00:22:53.280 align:start position:0%
governor and the president of unh and
 
00:22:55.909 --> 00:22:55.919 align:start position:0%
many other great things but um newburger
 
00:22:59.330 --> 00:22:59.340 align:start position:0%
was a student at Dartmouth who wanted to
 
00:23:00.890 --> 00:23:00.900 align:start position:0%
register to vote
 
00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:04.320 align:start position:0%
in in Hanover because that was and he
 
00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:06.240 align:start position:0%
was before he was hand over he's
 
00:23:08.630 --> 00:23:08.640 align:start position:0%
originally from from uh from Hawaii and
 
00:23:10.970 --> 00:23:10.980 align:start position:0%
then one thing special about his
 
00:23:13.070 --> 00:23:13.080 align:start position:0%
situation was that his parents had died
 
00:23:15.169 --> 00:23:15.179 align:start position:0%
so he was an orphan so he
 
00:23:17.930 --> 00:23:17.940 align:start position:0%
and he had no immediate intention of
 
00:23:20.029 --> 00:23:20.039 align:start position:0%
returning to Hawaii and he may have done
 
00:23:22.370 --> 00:23:22.380 align:start position:0%
so at some point so like he really had
 
00:23:25.010 --> 00:23:25.020 align:start position:0%
nowhere else to vote you know so
 
00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:26.760 align:start position:0%
a lot of times we go on about how saying
 
00:23:28.370 --> 00:23:28.380 align:start position:0%
well these college students they should
 
00:23:30.230 --> 00:23:30.240 align:start position:0%
vote absentee quote unquote back home
 
00:23:32.090 --> 00:23:32.100 align:start position:0%
not on all of them are eligible to vote
 
00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:33.960 align:start position:0%
back home even if they wanted to and
 
00:23:36.169 --> 00:23:36.179 align:start position:0%
that was the case for Mr neuberger for
 
00:23:38.570 --> 00:23:38.580 align:start position:0%
example 50 years ago and it's still the
 
00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:41.640 align:start position:0%
case for some students today thanks
 
00:23:43.669 --> 00:23:43.679 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:45.720 align:start position:0%
okay you're seeing none um thank you
 
00:23:47.330 --> 00:23:47.340 align:start position:0%
representative Horgan I only have one
 
00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:48.840 align:start position:0%
more pink card uh Secretary of State
 
00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:50.750 align:start position:0%
more pink card uh Secretary of State
Scanlon

00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:50.760 align:start position:0%
Scanlon
 
00:23:52.669 --> 00:23:52.679 align:start position:0%
the big man himself we're not getting
 
00:23:53.930 --> 00:23:53.940 align:start position:0%
the deputies or anybody there we're
 
00:24:03.890 --> 00:24:03.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman the members of the
 
00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:07.980 align:start position:0%
committee I'm David Scanlon Secretary of
 
00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:09.529 align:start position:0%
committee I'm David Scanlon Secretary of
State

00:24:09.529 --> 00:24:09.539 align:start position:0%
State
 
00:24:12.649 --> 00:24:12.659 align:start position:0%
um this bill has a lot in it and to the
 
00:24:14.810 --> 00:24:14.820 align:start position:0%
extent that it removes some of the
 
00:24:17.930 --> 00:24:17.940 align:start position:0%
language related to the passage of sb3
 
00:24:20.049 --> 00:24:20.059 align:start position:0%
which the court has found
 
00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:23.880 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional uh I would agree with
 
00:24:28.250 --> 00:24:28.260 align:start position:0%
removing those sections from the statute
 
00:24:30.770 --> 00:24:30.780 align:start position:0%
but if the bill is confusing in other
 
00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
respects and you know one of the one of
 
00:24:35.270 --> 00:24:35.280 align:start position:0%
the things that jumped out at me right
 
00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:36.230 align:start position:0%
the things that jumped out at me right
away

00:24:36.230 --> 00:24:36.240 align:start position:0%
away
 
00:24:39.470 --> 00:24:39.480 align:start position:0%
is if you look at uh
 
00:24:41.450 --> 00:24:41.460 align:start position:0%
on page four
 
00:24:43.490 --> 00:24:43.500 align:start position:0%
line six
 
00:24:46.789 --> 00:24:46.799 align:start position:0%
uh the statute that is being addressed
 
00:24:49.669 --> 00:24:49.679 align:start position:0%
here is General voter registration and
 
00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
the voter registration form
 
00:24:53.930 --> 00:24:53.940 align:start position:0%
and then if you look down further on
 
00:24:57.350 --> 00:24:57.360 align:start position:0%
lines 19 and 32
 
00:24:59.930 --> 00:24:59.940 align:start position:0%
uh there's reference to having this
 
00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:03.360 align:start position:0%
statute apply specifically to the day of
 
00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:05.280 align:start position:0%
the general election in terms of
 
00:25:08.210 --> 00:25:08.220 align:start position:0%
same-day registrations
 
00:25:10.370 --> 00:25:10.380 align:start position:0%
and then the same thing happens really
 
00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
throughout the bill but if you go to
 
00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
page five uh it talks about the the
 
00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
voter registration form
 
00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:20.880 align:start position:0%
and then if you go to page six
 
00:25:24.289 --> 00:25:24.299 align:start position:0%
and you look further down on line 23 it
 
00:25:26.390 --> 00:25:26.400 align:start position:0%
talks about the day of the state general
 
00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:27.950 align:start position:0%
talks about the day of the state general
election

00:25:27.950 --> 00:25:27.960 align:start position:0%
election
 
00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:29.390 align:start position:0%
election
and

00:25:29.390 --> 00:25:29.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:25:31.850 --> 00:25:31.860 align:start position:0%
it it
 
00:25:34.730 --> 00:25:34.740 align:start position:0%
begs the question what happens when
 
00:25:36.549 --> 00:25:36.559 align:start position:0%
there's an election on a state primary
 
00:25:39.190 --> 00:25:39.200 align:start position:0%
or a town election
 
00:25:42.409 --> 00:25:42.419 align:start position:0%
is there same day voter registration if
 
00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
this is specific to general election day
 
00:25:50.210 --> 00:25:50.220 align:start position:0%
I think it creates a lot of confusion
 
00:25:52.370 --> 00:25:52.380 align:start position:0%
and certainly we want voters to be able
 
00:25:56.090 --> 00:25:56.100 align:start position:0%
to register on the day of any statutory
 
00:25:58.970 --> 00:25:58.980 align:start position:0%
election not just state general election
 
00:25:58.980 --> 00:26:01.610 align:start position:0%
election not just state general election
day

00:26:01.610 --> 00:26:01.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:03.950 --> 00:26:03.960 align:start position:0%
the other item that I would just briefly
 
00:26:07.990 --> 00:26:08.000 align:start position:0%
address is that trying to find
 
00:26:10.730 --> 00:26:10.740 align:start position:0%
equilibrium in the definition of
 
00:26:13.909 --> 00:26:13.919 align:start position:0%
domicile and residents and how it
 
00:26:16.330 --> 00:26:16.340 align:start position:0%
applies to elections
 
00:26:19.549 --> 00:26:19.559 align:start position:0%
has had a pretty shaky past over the
 
00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
last decade
 
00:26:25.610 --> 00:26:25.620 align:start position:0%
and with with a court opinion advisory
 
00:26:28.549 --> 00:26:28.559 align:start position:0%
opinion and and the change of some
 
00:26:31.669 --> 00:26:31.679 align:start position:0%
statutes I think we've kind of hit
 
00:26:37.310 --> 00:26:37.320 align:start position:0%
a sweet spot in terms of how it really
 
00:26:40.370 --> 00:26:40.380 align:start position:0%
Consolidated the definition of domicile
 
00:26:43.310 --> 00:26:43.320 align:start position:0%
and residence so that it means the same
 
00:26:47.690 --> 00:26:47.700 align:start position:0%
thing in terms of our election laws
 
00:26:49.549 --> 00:26:49.559 align:start position:0%
um there was a question about what does
 
00:26:52.210 --> 00:26:52.220 align:start position:0%
temporary absence mean
 
00:26:55.549 --> 00:26:55.559 align:start position:0%
basically what that means is that
 
00:26:58.190 --> 00:26:58.200 align:start position:0%
you do not lose your domicile once it
 
00:27:00.769 --> 00:27:00.779 align:start position:0%
has been established until you
 
00:27:03.529 --> 00:27:03.539 align:start position:0%
re-establish a domicile in some other
 
00:27:03.539 --> 00:27:04.789 align:start position:0%
re-establish a domicile in some other
location

00:27:04.789 --> 00:27:04.799 align:start position:0%
location
 
00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:07.200 align:start position:0%
so if you are a resident of New
 
00:27:08.810 --> 00:27:08.820 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and you're a registered voter
 
00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:10.250 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and you're a registered voter
here

00:27:10.250 --> 00:27:10.260 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:12.480 align:start position:0%
and you go to school for example and
 
00:27:14.149 --> 00:27:14.159 align:start position:0%
you're going to be a student for four
 
00:27:17.570 --> 00:27:17.580 align:start position:0%
years in some other state
 
00:27:19.730 --> 00:27:19.740 align:start position:0%
that would be considered a temporary
 
00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
absence in fact in that instance a
 
00:27:25.130 --> 00:27:25.140 align:start position:0%
student has the choice of retaining
 
00:27:27.230 --> 00:27:27.240 align:start position:0%
their residence in the state that they
 
00:27:30.169 --> 00:27:30.179 align:start position:0%
lived in before they went to school or
 
00:27:32.090 --> 00:27:32.100 align:start position:0%
in the community that they are living in
 
00:27:34.970 --> 00:27:34.980 align:start position:0%
while they are attending school that's a
 
00:27:37.130 --> 00:27:37.140 align:start position:0%
choice that the student gets to make
 
00:27:39.049 --> 00:27:39.059 align:start position:0%
another example might be a construction
 
00:27:39.059 --> 00:27:40.970 align:start position:0%
another example might be a construction
worker

00:27:40.970 --> 00:27:40.980 align:start position:0%
worker
 
00:27:43.909 --> 00:27:43.919 align:start position:0%
that you know is from New Hampshire for
 
00:27:46.310 --> 00:27:46.320 align:start position:0%
example and there's a big project going
 
00:27:48.169 --> 00:27:48.179 align:start position:0%
on in the state of Texas that's the
 
00:27:49.610 --> 00:27:49.620 align:start position:0%
person is going to be there for six or
 
00:27:51.830 --> 00:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
seven months while they're working on
 
00:27:54.409 --> 00:27:54.419 align:start position:0%
the job they don't lose their domicile
 
00:27:56.630 --> 00:27:56.640 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire because they've been
 
00:27:58.909 --> 00:27:58.919 align:start position:0%
away for more than six months of the
 
00:27:58.919 --> 00:27:59.690 align:start position:0%
away for more than six months of the
year

00:27:59.690 --> 00:27:59.700 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:28:01.730 --> 00:28:01.740 align:start position:0%
you heard other examples you know a
 
00:28:03.529 --> 00:28:03.539 align:start position:0%
person that's serving on the high seas
 
00:28:07.130 --> 00:28:07.140 align:start position:0%
for long periods of time a person in the
 
00:28:09.529 --> 00:28:09.539 align:start position:0%
military there is no durational
 
00:28:12.710 --> 00:28:12.720 align:start position:0%
requirement as long as that voter does
 
00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:15.360 align:start position:0%
not establish a domicile in some other
 
00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:18.590 align:start position:0%
not establish a domicile in some other
location

00:28:18.590 --> 00:28:18.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:20.330 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:28:20.330 --> 00:28:20.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:22.010 --> 00:28:22.020 align:start position:0%
there may have been other questions I'm
 
00:28:24.409 --> 00:28:24.419 align:start position:0%
happy to answer them Mr chairman but I
 
00:28:26.450 --> 00:28:26.460 align:start position:0%
think that I'll just stop my testimony
 
00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
there and
 
00:28:29.930 --> 00:28:29.940 align:start position:0%
we have questions from the committee
 
00:28:32.269 --> 00:28:32.279 align:start position:0%
uh yes representative Lane
 
00:28:41.029 --> 00:28:41.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:41.039 --> 00:28:41.710 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:28:41.710 --> 00:28:41.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:28:44.330 --> 00:28:44.340 align:start position:0%
joining other ones do you need that
 
00:28:46.070 --> 00:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
Authority in a statute or is that
 
00:28:48.409 --> 00:28:48.419 align:start position:0%
something you already have the authority
 
00:28:50.690 --> 00:28:50.700 align:start position:0%
to do just under your general regulatory
 
00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:52.010 align:start position:0%
to do just under your general regulatory
powers

00:28:52.010 --> 00:28:52.020 align:start position:0%
powers
 
00:28:53.990 --> 00:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
I believe we already have the authority
 
00:28:56.529 --> 00:28:56.539 align:start position:0%
to do that we did
 
00:28:59.510 --> 00:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
participate in the Kansas cross check
 
00:29:02.750 --> 00:29:02.760 align:start position:0%
program that program is now defunct as
 
00:29:05.990 --> 00:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
it no longer exists there is another
 
00:29:08.210 --> 00:29:08.220 align:start position:0%
program that I'm sure you've all heard
 
00:29:10.310 --> 00:29:10.320 align:start position:0%
of called Eric
 
00:29:13.070 --> 00:29:13.080 align:start position:0%
um you know there are a lot more
 
00:29:15.549 --> 00:29:15.559 align:start position:0%
conditions to belong to that program
 
00:29:19.310 --> 00:29:19.320 align:start position:0%
than the Kansas cross check program
 
00:29:22.070 --> 00:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
I am not aware of another
 
00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:24.720 align:start position:0%
program that currently exists although I
 
00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
know that there are states talking about
 
00:29:29.810 --> 00:29:29.820 align:start position:0%
forming another program
 
00:29:31.549 --> 00:29:31.559 align:start position:0%
certainly I'd be really interested in
 
00:29:33.950 --> 00:29:33.960 align:start position:0%
seeing New Hampshire participate either
 
00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
as a group or individually with our
 
00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
surrounding New England states just so
 
00:29:43.370 --> 00:29:43.380 align:start position:0%
that we can share information
 
00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:46.640 align:start position:0%
we do share information
 
00:29:49.970 --> 00:29:49.980 align:start position:0%
not on a entire checklist level or
 
00:29:52.490 --> 00:29:52.500 align:start position:0%
database level but individual Town
 
00:29:55.789 --> 00:29:55.799 align:start position:0%
clerks when they become aware of a voter
 
00:29:58.389 --> 00:29:58.399 align:start position:0%
moving to a different state
 
00:30:01.610 --> 00:30:01.620 align:start position:0%
will notify you know they share
 
00:30:04.310 --> 00:30:04.320 align:start position:0%
notifications of when well if somebody
 
00:30:06.549 --> 00:30:06.559 align:start position:0%
registers from out of state in a town
 
00:30:10.310 --> 00:30:10.320 align:start position:0%
then our clerks are proactive among our
 
00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:12.240 align:start position:0%
sister States in New England with
 
00:30:14.690 --> 00:30:14.700 align:start position:0%
sending notifications out that you know
 
00:30:17.029 --> 00:30:17.039 align:start position:0%
this person has registered to vote in
 
00:30:19.310 --> 00:30:19.320 align:start position:0%
such and such a town that the further
 
00:30:21.409 --> 00:30:21.419 align:start position:0%
away from New England that you get the
 
00:30:23.710 --> 00:30:23.720 align:start position:0%
less likely that is to happen
 
00:30:26.690 --> 00:30:26.700 align:start position:0%
and so there certainly is a benefit to
 
00:30:28.810 --> 00:30:28.820 align:start position:0%
doing these multi-state
 
00:30:32.210 --> 00:30:32.220 align:start position:0%
projects But to answer your question I
 
00:30:33.590 --> 00:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
don't think my office needs the
 
00:30:35.450 --> 00:30:35.460 align:start position:0%
authority to participate in that I think
 
00:30:39.529 --> 00:30:39.539 align:start position:0%
that we could we could do it
 
00:30:42.710 --> 00:30:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:45.710 --> 00:30:45.720 align:start position:0%
um I had one um you brought up in your
 
00:30:47.510 --> 00:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
testimony and this has kind of always
 
00:30:49.630 --> 00:30:49.640 align:start position:0%
baffled me or I don't know baffled
 
00:30:53.269 --> 00:30:53.279 align:start position:0%
confuse me so
 
00:30:55.490 --> 00:30:55.500 align:start position:0%
why is it that well let's talk about
 
00:30:56.630 --> 00:30:56.640 align:start position:0%
students attending a four-year
 
00:30:58.430 --> 00:30:58.440 align:start position:0%
University right because the going to
 
00:31:00.470 --> 00:31:00.480 align:start position:0%
Texas for six months or being deployed
 
00:31:02.570 --> 00:31:02.580 align:start position:0%
and all that stuff four years is a long
 
00:31:04.850 --> 00:31:04.860 align:start position:0%
time that's four years is a long time so
 
00:31:06.529 --> 00:31:06.539 align:start position:0%
what is it is there court cases that
 
00:31:08.450 --> 00:31:08.460 align:start position:0%
have established that college students
 
00:31:10.130 --> 00:31:10.140 align:start position:0%
are special their effect it sounds to me
 
00:31:12.110 --> 00:31:12.120 align:start position:0%
like they're super voters right I get to
 
00:31:14.630 --> 00:31:14.640 align:start position:0%
pick where I get to vote but if they're
 
00:31:16.070 --> 00:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
attending a four-year University in New
 
00:31:17.990 --> 00:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they're spending the majority
 
00:31:19.669 --> 00:31:19.679 align:start position:0%
of their time in New Hampshire for an
 
00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
extended period of time it's four years
 
00:31:24.110 --> 00:31:24.120 align:start position:0%
right they're sleeping here ostensibly
 
00:31:27.710 --> 00:31:27.720 align:start position:0%
um conversely a person an in-state
 
00:31:29.090 --> 00:31:29.100 align:start position:0%
student who attends an out-of-state
 
00:31:31.549 --> 00:31:31.559 align:start position:0%
school for four years is sleeping in
 
00:31:33.889 --> 00:31:33.899 align:start position:0%
another state for four years right going
 
00:31:35.090 --> 00:31:35.100 align:start position:0%
and spending the majority of time in
 
00:31:37.430 --> 00:31:37.440 align:start position:0%
that Community for four years what make
 
00:31:39.590 --> 00:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
like I I don't get to do that right so
 
00:31:41.930 --> 00:31:41.940 align:start position:0%
like my parents live in Galveston
 
00:31:43.430 --> 00:31:43.440 align:start position:0%
um much what much nicer weather there
 
00:31:44.930 --> 00:31:44.940 align:start position:0%
this time of year
 
00:31:46.970 --> 00:31:46.980 align:start position:0%
um I don't get to say oh I go to
 
00:31:49.010 --> 00:31:49.020 align:start position:0%
Galveston once every year so like I get
 
00:31:50.990 --> 00:31:51.000 align:start position:0%
to vote in Texas now like what makes
 
00:31:53.210 --> 00:31:53.220 align:start position:0%
them special why can't I do that because
 
00:31:54.710 --> 00:31:54.720 align:start position:0%
is a four year period it's not an
 
00:31:56.269 --> 00:31:56.279 align:start position:0%
indefinite period of time like that's an
 
00:31:58.669 --> 00:31:58.679 align:start position:0%
extended period of time so like what
 
00:32:01.549 --> 00:32:01.559 align:start position:0%
makes them special well there are court
 
00:32:04.430 --> 00:32:04.440 align:start position:0%
cases supported by Statute and New
 
00:32:06.409 --> 00:32:06.419 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has a statute as well that
 
00:32:06.419 --> 00:32:07.370 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has a statute as well that
gives

00:32:07.370 --> 00:32:07.380 align:start position:0%
gives
 
00:32:12.110 --> 00:32:12.120 align:start position:0%
students the the choice of claiming
 
00:32:14.690 --> 00:32:14.700 align:start position:0%
where their domicile is
 
00:32:19.250 --> 00:32:19.260 align:start position:0%
and they can be considered absent
 
00:32:20.870 --> 00:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
you know from their
 
00:32:23.090 --> 00:32:23.100 align:start position:0%
place of domicile while they're going to
 
00:32:26.450 --> 00:32:26.460 align:start position:0%
college or if they're engaged in the
 
00:32:29.210 --> 00:32:29.220 align:start position:0%
community and and decide to make that
 
00:32:31.850 --> 00:32:31.860 align:start position:0%
their residence and and in effect their
 
00:32:34.669 --> 00:32:34.679 align:start position:0%
domicile they have the uh the
 
00:32:36.470 --> 00:32:36.480 align:start position:0%
opportunity to
 
00:32:39.409 --> 00:32:39.419 align:start position:0%
register to vote in the community that
 
00:32:40.730 --> 00:32:40.740 align:start position:0%
they're living in while they go to
 
00:32:40.740 --> 00:32:43.130 align:start position:0%
they're living in while they go to
college

00:32:43.130 --> 00:32:43.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
when someone does that however they are
 
00:32:47.450 --> 00:32:47.460 align:start position:0%
claiming that they are a resident
 
00:32:49.450 --> 00:32:49.460 align:start position:0%
domiciled in the state of New Hampshire
 
00:32:51.529 --> 00:32:51.539 align:start position:0%
for example
 
00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
um and they're subject to all the laws
 
00:32:55.310 --> 00:32:55.320 align:start position:0%
of the State of New Hampshire that apply
 
00:32:57.470 --> 00:32:57.480 align:start position:0%
to Residents and I believe the same is
 
00:33:01.549 --> 00:33:01.559 align:start position:0%
true in other states around the country
 
00:33:03.289 --> 00:33:03.299 align:start position:0%
any questions were asked my follow-up
 
00:33:05.870 --> 00:33:05.880 align:start position:0%
yes representative Brennan
 
00:33:07.370 --> 00:33:07.380 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you take my
 
00:33:07.380 --> 00:33:08.630 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you take my
question

00:33:08.630 --> 00:33:08.640 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:33:12.169 --> 00:33:12.179 align:start position:0%
if someone were to establish a domicile
 
00:33:14.389 --> 00:33:14.399 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire
 
00:33:17.090 --> 00:33:17.100 align:start position:0%
and my understanding it correctly that
 
00:33:20.269 --> 00:33:20.279 align:start position:0%
if they were to attempt to vote
 
00:33:21.950 --> 00:33:21.960 align:start position:0%
somewhere else
 
00:33:24.710 --> 00:33:24.720 align:start position:0%
that there there is a penalty for that
 
00:33:27.769 --> 00:33:27.779 align:start position:0%
and they would have to sign something to
 
00:33:31.130 --> 00:33:31.140 align:start position:0%
establish their domicile here that
 
00:33:34.070 --> 00:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
acknowledges that they understand it is
 
00:33:39.169 --> 00:33:39.179 align:start position:0%
a crime to vote in more than one place
 
00:33:41.990 --> 00:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
uh that information may be on the voter
 
00:33:43.850 --> 00:33:43.860 align:start position:0%
registration form I mean it is a crime
 
00:33:45.950 --> 00:33:45.960 align:start position:0%
to vote in more than one
 
00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:47.630 align:start position:0%
to vote in more than one
location

00:33:47.630 --> 00:33:47.640 align:start position:0%
location
 
00:33:50.509 --> 00:33:50.519 align:start position:0%
in the same election
 
00:33:53.690 --> 00:33:53.700 align:start position:0%
somebody could be registered uh to vote
 
00:33:57.190 --> 00:33:57.200 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire uh and participate in
 
00:33:59.630 --> 00:33:59.640 align:start position:0%
uh let's say the town elections coming
 
00:34:01.070 --> 00:34:01.080 align:start position:0%
up in March
 
00:34:04.009 --> 00:34:04.019 align:start position:0%
but their circumstance may change after
 
00:34:06.110 --> 00:34:06.120 align:start position:0%
that and they may move to a different
 
00:34:08.810 --> 00:34:08.820 align:start position:0%
state and participate in in a
 
00:34:10.310 --> 00:34:10.320 align:start position:0%
presidential primary
 
00:34:12.349 --> 00:34:12.359 align:start position:0%
in some other location
 
00:34:16.310 --> 00:34:16.320 align:start position:0%
there's there is nothing wrong with that
 
00:34:18.649 --> 00:34:18.659 align:start position:0%
scenario because the person has
 
00:34:21.050 --> 00:34:21.060 align:start position:0%
established their domicile in a
 
00:34:22.490 --> 00:34:22.500 align:start position:0%
different place they're not voting in
 
00:34:25.010 --> 00:34:25.020 align:start position:0%
the same election more than once
 
00:34:27.470 --> 00:34:27.480 align:start position:0%
and their name may appear on two
 
00:34:29.270 --> 00:34:29.280 align:start position:0%
different checklists for a period of
 
00:34:31.790 --> 00:34:31.800 align:start position:0%
time until uh you know that that
 
00:34:34.430 --> 00:34:34.440 align:start position:0%
information catches up and and the
 
00:34:37.250 --> 00:34:37.260 align:start position:0%
checklist is corrected
 
00:34:39.409 --> 00:34:39.419 align:start position:0%
but that would not be a violation of a
 
00:34:39.419 --> 00:34:40.849 align:start position:0%
but that would not be a violation of a
statute

00:34:40.849 --> 00:34:40.859 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:34:45.230 --> 00:34:45.240 align:start position:0%
about of course if the if there were an
 
00:34:47.690 --> 00:34:47.700 align:start position:0%
amendment to this
 
00:34:50.270 --> 00:34:50.280 align:start position:0%
um bill that addresses your concerns
 
00:34:53.290 --> 00:34:53.300 align:start position:0%
about the
 
00:34:57.950 --> 00:34:57.960 align:start position:0%
uh day of estate general election
 
00:34:59.870 --> 00:34:59.880 align:start position:0%
is this a bill that you would support
 
00:35:02.690 --> 00:35:02.700 align:start position:0%
given that you
 
00:35:06.070 --> 00:35:06.080 align:start position:0%
support a repeal of sb3's
 
00:35:08.030 --> 00:35:08.040 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional language
 
00:35:10.849 --> 00:35:10.859 align:start position:0%
I would support cleaning up the sb3
 
00:35:13.190 --> 00:35:13.200 align:start position:0%
language in a statute
 
00:35:15.950 --> 00:35:15.960 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned about the section that you
 
00:35:17.390 --> 00:35:17.400 align:start position:0%
just mentioned about you know making it
 
00:35:19.190 --> 00:35:19.200 align:start position:0%
apply just to the day of the general
 
00:35:21.770 --> 00:35:21.780 align:start position:0%
election to the extent that there are
 
00:35:23.990 --> 00:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
Provisions in here that
 
00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:24.589 align:start position:0%
Provisions in here that
um

00:35:24.589 --> 00:35:24.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:27.349 --> 00:35:27.359 align:start position:0%
the change the the definition of
 
00:35:30.470 --> 00:35:30.480 align:start position:0%
domicile or residency I think that just
 
00:35:33.670 --> 00:35:33.680 align:start position:0%
pushes us back into turmoil
 
00:35:36.950 --> 00:35:36.960 align:start position:0%
and I would not want to see that happen
 
00:35:40.010 --> 00:35:40.020 align:start position:0%
and in terms of uh you know
 
00:35:42.710 --> 00:35:42.720 align:start position:0%
participating in some type of a
 
00:35:45.230 --> 00:35:45.240 align:start position:0%
uh you know I'll call it some type of a
 
00:35:48.290 --> 00:35:48.300 align:start position:0%
cross-check program comparing checklists
 
00:35:49.870 --> 00:35:49.880 align:start position:0%
uh but I certainly would support
 
00:35:52.910 --> 00:35:52.920 align:start position:0%
something like that but again I don't
 
00:35:55.870 --> 00:35:55.880 align:start position:0%
think that the office needs
 
00:36:00.950 --> 00:36:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:03.109 --> 00:36:03.119 align:start position:0%
representative Howard thank you Mr chair
 
00:36:05.450 --> 00:36:05.460 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr secretary for uh taking
 
00:36:08.210 --> 00:36:08.220 align:start position:0%
my question uh so when we're looking at
 
00:36:09.950 --> 00:36:09.960 align:start position:0%
people who are currently living in
 
00:36:12.710 --> 00:36:12.720 align:start position:0%
nursing homes uh would you recommend
 
00:36:14.990 --> 00:36:15.000 align:start position:0%
that they vote at their current
 
00:36:17.630 --> 00:36:17.640 align:start position:0%
Residence at that nursing home or uh
 
00:36:20.030 --> 00:36:20.040 align:start position:0%
where there are originally domiciled
 
00:36:22.569 --> 00:36:22.579 align:start position:0%
before uh taking up residency there
 
00:36:26.450 --> 00:36:26.460 align:start position:0%
nursing home is another category where
 
00:36:28.810 --> 00:36:28.820 align:start position:0%
the voter has a choice
 
00:36:32.390 --> 00:36:32.400 align:start position:0%
if a a voter going into an elder care
 
00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:33.970 align:start position:0%
if a a voter going into an elder care
facility

00:36:33.970 --> 00:36:33.980 align:start position:0%
facility
 
00:36:37.550 --> 00:36:37.560 align:start position:0%
can continue to vote from the location
 
00:36:41.210 --> 00:36:41.220 align:start position:0%
that they came from even if family sells
 
00:36:44.030 --> 00:36:44.040 align:start position:0%
their house and you know that person in
 
00:36:45.770 --> 00:36:45.780 align:start position:0%
their mind May believe that they're
 
00:36:48.650 --> 00:36:48.660 align:start position:0%
going back uh at some point even though
 
00:36:51.710 --> 00:36:51.720 align:start position:0%
you know that's not a practical outcome
 
00:36:53.750 --> 00:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
however they also have the opportunity
 
00:36:56.089 --> 00:36:56.099 align:start position:0%
of claiming domicile
 
00:36:59.569 --> 00:36:59.579 align:start position:0%
from the location of the nursing
 
00:37:01.910 --> 00:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
facility and so they could vote from
 
00:37:04.790 --> 00:37:04.800 align:start position:0%
that location but once they do that they
 
00:37:07.190 --> 00:37:07.200 align:start position:0%
lose their domicile from the place that
 
00:37:09.589 --> 00:37:09.599 align:start position:0%
they came from
 
00:37:13.730 --> 00:37:13.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:15.349 --> 00:37:15.359 align:start position:0%
any other questions I I could do this
 
00:37:16.790 --> 00:37:16.800 align:start position:0%
all day I find this stuff fascinating so
 
00:37:18.470 --> 00:37:18.480 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna stop but
 
00:37:20.390 --> 00:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
um any other questions
 
00:37:22.069 --> 00:37:22.079 align:start position:0%
all right thank you secretary Scanlon
 
00:37:24.650 --> 00:37:24.660 align:start position:0%
thank you um can we get the blue sheet
 
00:37:28.730 --> 00:37:28.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:30.109 --> 00:37:30.119 align:start position:0%
I assume no one else here wants to speak
 
00:37:32.089 --> 00:37:32.099 align:start position:0%
on this we're gonna get like a 25 minute
 
00:37:42.589 --> 00:37:42.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:44.270 --> 00:37:44.280 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:45.680 align:start position:0%
thank you representative

okay
[Music]

[Music]
 
00:37:46.020 --> 00:37:47.230 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

00:37:47.230 --> 00:37:47.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:49.790 --> 00:37:49.800 align:start position:0%
all right so we had uh four people sign
 
00:37:53.210 --> 00:37:53.220 align:start position:0%
up in total three in favor one opposed
 
00:37:55.910 --> 00:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
um and with that I will uh close the
 
00:37:59.150 --> 00:37:59.160 align:start position:0%
hearing on hb40 we will be in uh the
 
00:38:01.550 --> 00:38:01.560 align:start position:0%
committee will stand in recess until 11
 
00:38:04.250 --> 00:38:04.260 align:start position:0%
A.M today which which point we will
 
00:46:01.250 --> 00:46:01.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:49.849 --> 01:04:49.859 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:52.490 --> 01:04:52.500 align:start position:0%
welcome back
 
01:04:55.069 --> 01:04:55.079 align:start position:0%
we will open the executive session on
 
01:04:58.370 --> 01:04:58.380 align:start position:0%
House Bill 482 representative Bohm is
 
01:04:59.990 --> 01:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
recognized for a motion
 
01:05:03.710 --> 01:05:03.720 align:start position:0%
I make a motion to itl 482. was there a
 
01:05:10.370 --> 01:05:10.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:11.630 --> 01:05:11.640 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak stream motion
 
01:05:14.809 --> 01:05:14.819 align:start position:0%
yes does Bill
 
01:05:17.150 --> 01:05:17.160 align:start position:0%
it's completely goes overboard on what's
 
01:05:20.270 --> 01:05:20.280 align:start position:0%
needed the accountability for example in
 
01:05:22.730 --> 01:05:22.740 align:start position:0%
an election is the number of ballots
 
01:05:25.730 --> 01:05:25.740 align:start position:0%
versus the number of people that voted
 
01:05:27.710 --> 01:05:27.720 align:start position:0%
the ballots themselves don't have to be
 
01:05:30.829 --> 01:05:30.839 align:start position:0%
mocked or anything I mean and then the
 
01:05:32.569 --> 01:05:32.579 align:start position:0%
argument about
 
01:05:35.690 --> 01:05:35.700 align:start position:0%
There Was X number of unreturned or
 
01:05:38.450 --> 01:05:38.460 align:start position:0%
uncounted absentee ballots yeah people
 
01:05:39.950 --> 01:05:39.960 align:start position:0%
didn't send them in
 
01:05:43.010 --> 01:05:43.020 align:start position:0%
or they got late they got it in late the
 
01:05:45.230 --> 01:05:45.240 align:start position:0%
point is as long as the number of
 
01:05:48.049 --> 01:05:48.059 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots received equals the
 
01:05:50.390 --> 01:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
number of absentee ballots voted it's a
 
01:05:53.450 --> 01:05:53.460 align:start position:0%
simple counting system so most of this
 
01:05:57.770 --> 01:05:57.780 align:start position:0%
stuff in this bill is is completely not
 
01:06:00.470 --> 01:06:00.480 align:start position:0%
necessary I mean the accounting is
 
01:06:02.089 --> 01:06:02.099 align:start position:0%
equal to
 
01:06:04.970 --> 01:06:04.980 align:start position:0%
and when we do the some that already
 
01:06:07.130 --> 01:06:07.140 align:start position:0%
doing it the
 
01:06:10.670 --> 01:06:10.680 align:start position:0%
um electronic when you come in you're
 
01:06:12.770 --> 01:06:12.780 align:start position:0%
there and then the accounting is easy
 
01:06:15.289 --> 01:06:15.299 align:start position:0%
but if the number of people that counted
 
01:06:17.750 --> 01:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
the ballots I mean at the machines that
 
01:06:19.309 --> 01:06:19.319 align:start position:0%
counted the balance equal the number of
 
01:06:21.289 --> 01:06:21.299 align:start position:0%
people voted that's all the
 
01:06:23.870 --> 01:06:23.880 align:start position:0%
accountability we really need so thank
 
01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:25.549 align:start position:0%
accountability we really need so thank
you

01:06:25.549 --> 01:06:25.559 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:06:29.750 --> 01:06:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:32.809 --> 01:06:32.819 align:start position:0%
okay the motion is inexperienced to
 
01:06:36.470 --> 01:06:36.480 align:start position:0%
legislate on House Bill 482 the clerk
 
01:06:38.690 --> 01:06:38.700 align:start position:0%
will call the roll representative Berry
 
01:06:38.700 --> 01:06:42.230 align:start position:0%
will call the roll representative Berry
yes

01:06:42.230 --> 01:06:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:45.890 --> 01:06:45.900 align:start position:0%
representative Prudhomme O'Brien yes
 
01:06:48.650 --> 01:06:48.660 align:start position:0%
representative Bohm
 
01:06:51.589 --> 01:06:51.599 align:start position:0%
representative qualey yes
 
01:06:55.010 --> 01:06:55.020 align:start position:0%

House Bill 502 representative Barry is
 
01:09:19.010 --> 01:09:19.020 align:start position:0%
recognized for emotion uh yes I moved

that house bill 502 be inexpedient to
 
01:09:20.940 --> 01:09:23.269 align:start position:0%
that house bill 502 be inexpedient to
legislate

01:09:23.269 --> 01:09:23.279 align:start position:0%
legislate
 
01:09:25.130 --> 01:09:25.140 align:start position:0%
representative Berry moves in expedient
 
01:09:33.349 --> 01:09:33.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:34.970 --> 01:09:34.980 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak to your motion
 
01:09:36.470 --> 01:09:36.480 align:start position:0%
we could do it now or we can do it on
 
01:09:38.150 --> 01:09:38.160 align:start position:0%
the OTP
 
01:09:38.160 --> 01:09:41.390 align:start position:0%
the OTP
um

01:09:41.390 --> 01:09:41.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:44.150 --> 01:09:44.160 align:start position:0%
this is a major step backwards
 
01:09:46.970 --> 01:09:46.980 align:start position:0%
um there were things in the bill that
 
01:09:48.829 --> 01:09:48.839 align:start position:0%
weren't brought up in committee the
 
01:09:50.329 --> 01:09:50.339 align:start position:0%
first and foremost was out to bring in
 
01:09:52.370 --> 01:09:52.380 align:start position:0%
this it brings back the religious
 
01:09:52.380 --> 01:09:54.169 align:start position:0%
this it brings back the religious
affidavit

01:09:54.169 --> 01:09:54.179 align:start position:0%
affidavit
 
01:09:54.179 --> 01:09:56.030 align:start position:0%
affidavit
um so

01:09:56.030 --> 01:09:56.040 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:09:59.150 --> 01:09:59.160 align:start position:0%
before I believe we removed that uh two
 
01:10:01.189 --> 01:10:01.199 align:start position:0%
years ago on a separate bill I I want to
 
01:10:03.169 --> 01:10:03.179 align:start position:0%
say it had bipartisan support I could be
 
01:10:04.550 --> 01:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
wrong about that so don't pull me to
 
01:10:07.189 --> 01:10:07.199 align:start position:0%
that but what this bill would do is he
 
01:10:10.310 --> 01:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
would re-establish a ludicrous system of
 
01:10:11.630 --> 01:10:11.640 align:start position:0%
voter registration
 
01:10:14.570 --> 01:10:14.580 align:start position:0%
so let's explain what this bill would do
 
01:10:16.790 --> 01:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
this bill would mean that any person
 
01:10:19.330 --> 01:10:19.340 align:start position:0%
could walk into any polling location
 
01:10:22.310 --> 01:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
present nothing
 
01:10:24.709 --> 01:10:24.719 align:start position:0%
and then be given a ballot nothing so
 
01:10:26.450 --> 01:10:26.460 align:start position:0%
not a driver's license not a piece of
 
01:10:28.790 --> 01:10:28.800 align:start position:0%
mail not a student ID they literally
 
01:10:30.169 --> 01:10:30.179 align:start position:0%
would walk into the polling place with
 
01:10:33.050 --> 01:10:33.060 align:start position:0%
nothing not be on the polls register to
 
01:10:35.149 --> 01:10:35.159 align:start position:0%
vote and be handed a ballot
 
01:10:37.550 --> 01:10:37.560 align:start position:0%
and then it brings back the religious
 
01:10:39.890 --> 01:10:39.900 align:start position:0%
waiver which we got rid of the religious
 
01:10:42.229 --> 01:10:42.239 align:start position:0%
waiver says that a person may sign in a
 
01:10:44.270 --> 01:10:44.280 align:start position:0%
religious waiver affidavit if according
 
01:10:45.290 --> 01:10:45.300 align:start position:0%
to their religion they may not have
 
01:10:48.290 --> 01:10:48.300 align:start position:0%
their photo taken so even before this we
 
01:10:50.149 --> 01:10:50.159 align:start position:0%
removed that so that if somebody who
 
01:10:51.950 --> 01:10:51.960 align:start position:0%
walked in on the polls with nothing they
 
01:10:53.630 --> 01:10:53.640 align:start position:0%
at least had to have their photo taken
 
01:10:56.510 --> 01:10:56.520 align:start position:0%
but this repeals that so now they can
 
01:10:58.189 --> 01:10:58.199 align:start position:0%
say according to my religion I don't
 
01:11:00.110 --> 01:11:00.120 align:start position:0%
want my photo taken
 
01:11:02.209 --> 01:11:02.219 align:start position:0%
um and they won't even have to have
 
01:11:04.130 --> 01:11:04.140 align:start position:0%
their photo taken anymore
 
01:11:06.350 --> 01:11:06.360 align:start position:0%
there when we did that when we removed
 
01:11:09.110 --> 01:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
that waiver the first time somebody said
 
01:11:10.550 --> 01:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
oh well there's somebody's going to sue
 
01:11:12.709 --> 01:11:12.719 align:start position:0%
well people sue for over election law
 
01:11:14.930 --> 01:11:14.940 align:start position:0%
almost every time anyways but they never
 
01:11:16.490 --> 01:11:16.500 align:start position:0%
found anybody with standing they
 
01:11:17.750 --> 01:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
couldn't find a single person in the
 
01:11:18.890 --> 01:11:18.900 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire that says it's
 
01:11:20.510 --> 01:11:20.520 align:start position:0%
against my religion to be photographed
 
01:11:22.370 --> 01:11:22.380 align:start position:0%
because it's not realistic you can't
 
01:11:23.750 --> 01:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
leave your house without being on
 
01:11:25.550 --> 01:11:25.560 align:start position:0%
somebody's ring camera there's no way
 
01:11:26.870 --> 01:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
you're going to drive to the polls
 
01:11:28.250 --> 01:11:28.260 align:start position:0%
without being on somebody's dash camera
 
01:11:30.950 --> 01:11:30.960 align:start position:0%
it's it's a ludicrous proposition that
 
01:11:33.350 --> 01:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
they hold this value set that they don't
 
01:11:34.610 --> 01:11:34.620 align:start position:0%
believe that they have to have they can
 
01:11:35.930 --> 01:11:35.940 align:start position:0%
have their photo taken because they
 
01:11:36.890 --> 01:11:36.900 align:start position:0%
really wouldn't be able to leave the
 
01:11:39.110 --> 01:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
house that's just unfortunately it's
 
01:11:41.270 --> 01:11:41.280 align:start position:0%
today's society I'm a privacy person by
 
01:11:43.189 --> 01:11:43.199 align:start position:0%
the way I'm one of the people that keeps
 
01:11:46.430 --> 01:11:46.440 align:start position:0%
a little uh keeps the little uh sticky
 
01:11:48.169 --> 01:11:48.179 align:start position:0%
note on top of the camera on their
 
01:11:50.030 --> 01:11:50.040 align:start position:0%
laptop like I get it I don't want my
 
01:11:53.149 --> 01:11:53.159 align:start position:0%
photo taken either but we can't have a
 
01:11:55.189 --> 01:11:55.199 align:start position:0%
system where you show up to the polls on
 
01:11:57.649 --> 01:11:57.659 align:start position:0%
Election Day with nothing
 
01:12:00.890 --> 01:12:00.900 align:start position:0%
um when we pass SB 418 with provisional
 
01:12:03.050 --> 01:12:03.060 align:start position:0%
ballots I was the one who I caught a lot
 
01:12:04.070 --> 01:12:04.080 align:start position:0%
of flack for this I'm the one who
 
01:12:08.149 --> 01:12:08.159 align:start position:0%
watered it down it originally applied to
 
01:12:09.830 --> 01:12:09.840 align:start position:0%
everybody showing up to the polls on
 
01:12:11.570 --> 01:12:11.580 align:start position:0%
election day without an ID and I said
 
01:12:13.729 --> 01:12:13.739 align:start position:0%
well that's that's a big step so we
 
01:12:15.890 --> 01:12:15.900 align:start position:0%
curtailed it to only people who are
 
01:12:18.050 --> 01:12:18.060 align:start position:0%
registering on Election Day so we're not
 
01:12:20.390 --> 01:12:20.400 align:start position:0%
talking about you know 90 of Voters
 
01:12:22.430 --> 01:12:22.440 align:start position:0%
we're talking about the 10 of the
 
01:12:24.470 --> 01:12:24.480 align:start position:0%
register on Election Day and the tiny
 
01:12:26.330 --> 01:12:26.340 align:start position:0%
subset inside of that which I believe
 
01:12:28.729 --> 01:12:28.739 align:start position:0%
was less than 600 people who bring
 
01:12:32.030 --> 01:12:32.040 align:start position:0%
nothing to the polls so voter ID as a
 
01:12:33.649 --> 01:12:33.659 align:start position:0%
whole is very popular in New Hampshire
 
01:12:36.770 --> 01:12:36.780 align:start position:0%
it holds over 70 popularity it holds
 
01:12:38.630 --> 01:12:38.640 align:start position:0%
over 50 popularity with Democrats
 
01:12:41.030 --> 01:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
according to UNH polling it's a very
 
01:12:42.290 --> 01:12:42.300 align:start position:0%
popular thing
 
01:12:44.149 --> 01:12:44.159 align:start position:0%
no one here is trying to restrict access
 
01:12:46.790 --> 01:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
to the ballot no one here is trying to
 
01:12:50.149 --> 01:12:50.159 align:start position:0%
stop uh you A Kava ballots military
 
01:12:52.310 --> 01:12:52.320 align:start position:0%
voters from voting SB 418 was brought
 
01:12:55.729 --> 01:12:55.739 align:start position:0%
forward by a veteran it was passed in
 
01:12:57.950 --> 01:12:57.960 align:start position:0%
this committee on a motion made by a
 
01:13:00.229 --> 01:13:00.239 align:start position:0%
veteran if you have you okava concerns
 
01:13:04.070 --> 01:13:04.080 align:start position:0%
move the primary date move the primary
 
01:13:08.270 --> 01:13:08.280 align:start position:0%
date this year for 2024 the primary it
 
01:13:09.350 --> 01:13:09.360 align:start position:0%
wouldn't even be a problem I believe
 
01:13:12.130 --> 01:13:12.140 align:start position:0%
there's like 53 or 56 days in between
 
01:13:16.070 --> 01:13:16.080 align:start position:0%
the primary and the general this bill is
 
01:13:18.709 --> 01:13:18.719 align:start position:0%
not an attack on Military voters it's a
 
01:13:20.570 --> 01:13:20.580 align:start position:0%
when they when they lob that it's
 
01:13:22.310 --> 01:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
offensive I'm the son of a military
 
01:13:24.050 --> 01:13:24.060 align:start position:0%
veteran from Vietnam he's got a bronze
 
01:13:26.030 --> 01:13:26.040 align:start position:0%
star and my brother's a veteran no one
 
01:13:27.530 --> 01:13:27.540 align:start position:0%
who voted for this the first time was
 
01:13:30.590 --> 01:13:30.600 align:start position:0%
attacking veterans all of these are just
 
01:13:32.510 --> 01:13:32.520 align:start position:0%
red herring distractions
 
01:13:34.970 --> 01:13:34.980 align:start position:0%
we have to know who's voting in our
 
01:13:38.270 --> 01:13:38.280 align:start position:0%
elections yes people have a right to
 
01:13:40.550 --> 01:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
vote in elections I am a Republican and
 
01:13:42.350 --> 01:13:42.360 align:start position:0%
I hold the unpopular opinion amongst my
 
01:13:43.910 --> 01:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
party that college students who move
 
01:13:46.070 --> 01:13:46.080 align:start position:0%
here and go to UNH have a right to vote
 
01:13:48.590 --> 01:13:48.600 align:start position:0%
here I hold that opinion I get a lot of
 
01:13:49.729 --> 01:13:49.739 align:start position:0%
flack for it
 
01:13:52.070 --> 01:13:52.080 align:start position:0%
but I don't understand why we hold
 
01:13:54.590 --> 01:13:54.600 align:start position:0%
college students up like somehow the
 
01:13:56.470 --> 01:13:56.480 align:start position:0%
people who are getting four-year degrees
 
01:13:59.270 --> 01:13:59.280 align:start position:0%
are not smart enough to bring an ID to
 
01:14:00.950 --> 01:14:00.960 align:start position:0%
the polls like these are people that we
 
01:14:02.209 --> 01:14:02.219 align:start position:0%
have selected and said you're some of
 
01:14:03.709 --> 01:14:03.719 align:start position:0%
the brightest in our society yet you
 
01:14:05.149 --> 01:14:05.159 align:start position:0%
can't remember to bring an ID to the
 
01:14:06.950 --> 01:14:06.960 align:start position:0%
polls when you're registering to vote
 
01:14:09.530 --> 01:14:09.540 align:start position:0%
for the first time it's ludicrous it's a
 
01:14:12.410 --> 01:14:12.420 align:start position:0%
huge step back I get it that there will
 
01:14:14.689 --> 01:14:14.699 align:start position:0%
be implementation issues with this it's
 
01:14:17.209 --> 01:14:17.219 align:start position:0%
a bold new thing but we have to find a
 
01:14:18.470 --> 01:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
way to figure out who's actually
 
01:14:20.689 --> 01:14:20.699 align:start position:0%
registering to vote you have a right to
 
01:14:22.850 --> 01:14:22.860 align:start position:0%
vote in the election the voters also
 
01:14:24.709 --> 01:14:24.719 align:start position:0%
have a right to know who is voting in
 
01:14:26.630 --> 01:14:26.640 align:start position:0%
their elections so I urge this committee
 
01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:30.050 align:start position:0%
their elections so I urge this committee
Ito

01:14:30.050 --> 01:14:30.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:36.950 --> 01:14:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:39.890 --> 01:14:39.900 align:start position:0%
is that a boom yeah thank you yeah did I
 
01:14:42.590 --> 01:14:42.600 align:start position:0%
counted last night or yesterday there
 
01:14:46.070 --> 01:14:46.080 align:start position:0%
are 56 days between the primary and the
 
01:14:48.830 --> 01:14:48.840 align:start position:0%
election in 2024. you got to pull that
 
01:14:51.290 --> 01:14:51.300 align:start position:0%
mic a Little Closer
 
01:14:53.930 --> 01:14:53.940 align:start position:0%
so that that is not a problem so that's
 
01:14:59.149 --> 01:14:59.159 align:start position:0%
11 days before and also how many
 
01:15:03.169 --> 01:15:03.179 align:start position:0%
towns and whatnot would require that
 
01:15:06.350 --> 01:15:06.360 align:start position:0%
the balance not be printed
 
01:15:10.310 --> 01:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
at 55 days before I mean be a very small
 
01:15:15.250 --> 01:15:15.260 align:start position:0%
number because it's the if the number of
 
01:15:18.530 --> 01:15:18.540 align:start position:0%
affidavit ballots does not
 
01:15:21.290 --> 01:15:21.300 align:start position:0%
is lower than the number of differences
 
01:15:23.750 --> 01:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
in in the votes
 
01:15:25.729 --> 01:15:25.739 align:start position:0%
what difference does it make yeah the
 
01:15:27.350 --> 01:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
balance will still be pulled but it's
 
01:15:30.410 --> 01:15:30.420 align:start position:0%
not going to change the outcome so on
 
01:15:30.420 --> 01:15:31.610 align:start position:0%
not going to change the outcome so on
those

01:15:31.610 --> 01:15:31.620 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:15:34.430 --> 01:15:34.440 align:start position:0%
few yes those may be a few towns maybe
 
01:15:38.209 --> 01:15:38.219 align:start position:0%
ten I mean may have to wait until
 
01:15:42.890 --> 01:15:42.900 align:start position:0%
50 days I mean 52 days 53 days before
 
01:15:44.750 --> 01:15:44.760 align:start position:0%
their ballot
 
01:15:47.689 --> 01:15:47.699 align:start position:0%
is is can be printed but that's still
 
01:15:49.910 --> 01:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
less than the 45 days by the government
 
01:15:53.450 --> 01:15:53.460 align:start position:0%
and yes we have to and we will move the
 
01:15:57.770 --> 01:15:57.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:00.290 --> 01:16:00.300 align:start position:0%
so about that move in the primary thing
 
01:16:02.810 --> 01:16:02.820 align:start position:0%
that is not the subject of the bill so
 
01:16:05.030 --> 01:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
let's keep off of that further
 
01:16:06.530 --> 01:16:06.540 align:start position:0%
discretion on the bill
 
01:16:06.540 --> 01:16:10.790 align:start position:0%
discretion on the bill
foreign

01:16:10.790 --> 01:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:14.030 --> 01:16:14.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh so I have a
 
01:16:17.330 --> 01:16:17.340 align:start position:0%
number of issues with HP 502 uh and to
 
01:16:18.950 --> 01:16:18.960 align:start position:0%
speak to representative Barry's point
 
01:16:21.290 --> 01:16:21.300 align:start position:0%
about college students potentially uh
 
01:16:24.470 --> 01:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
forgetting things on Election Day uh one
 
01:16:26.689 --> 01:16:26.699 align:start position:0%
of the biggest issues uh that college
 
01:16:28.490 --> 01:16:28.500 align:start position:0%
students come across is they don't
 
01:16:29.630 --> 01:16:29.640 align:start position:0%
necessarily remember to bring their
 
01:16:31.130 --> 01:16:31.140 align:start position:0%
birth certificate or their passport with
 
01:16:35.149 --> 01:16:35.159 align:start position:0%
them and once you get down uh into the
 
01:16:37.250 --> 01:16:37.260 align:start position:0%
university it can be something where you
 
01:16:38.810 --> 01:16:38.820 align:start position:0%
might not necessarily remember to bring
 
01:16:40.430 --> 01:16:40.440 align:start position:0%
that with you the next time that you go
 
01:16:42.709 --> 01:16:42.719 align:start position:0%
back uh and with a lot of these people
 
01:16:44.570 --> 01:16:44.580 align:start position:0%
being 18 and voting for the first time
 
01:16:46.729 --> 01:16:46.739 align:start position:0%
they might not necessarily know the
 
01:16:49.910 --> 01:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
process and uh may end up forgetting
 
01:16:51.770 --> 01:16:51.780 align:start position:0%
things and why they need the affidavit
 
01:16:55.189 --> 01:16:55.199 align:start position:0%
giving them an extra week to bring in uh
 
01:16:57.050 --> 01:16:57.060 align:start position:0%
that information might not necessarily
 
01:16:58.910 --> 01:16:58.920 align:start position:0%
be enough if they live all the way if
 
01:17:02.689 --> 01:17:02.699 align:start position:0%
they're from uh Arizona per instance uh
 
01:17:04.550 --> 01:17:04.560 align:start position:0%
they might not necessarily have time to
 
01:17:07.550 --> 01:17:07.560 align:start position:0%
get that information in those documents
 
01:17:09.229 --> 01:17:09.239 align:start position:0%
back to New Hampshire
 
01:17:11.689 --> 01:17:11.699 align:start position:0%
and we need to think about how that
 
01:17:14.810 --> 01:17:14.820 align:start position:0%
impacts them uh we also have to face the
 
01:17:16.370 --> 01:17:16.380 align:start position:0%
fact that we have not changed the
 
01:17:18.950 --> 01:17:18.960 align:start position:0%
primary date and that SB 418 was passed
 
01:17:22.970 --> 01:17:22.980 align:start position:0%
as an unconstitutional bill uh that all
 
01:17:25.189 --> 01:17:25.199 align:start position:0%
considered is why we should not move
 
01:17:27.229 --> 01:17:27.239 align:start position:0%
forward and vote down this Bill thank
 
01:17:27.239 --> 01:17:31.310 align:start position:0%
forward and vote down this Bill thank
you

01:17:31.310 --> 01:17:31.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:33.950 --> 01:17:33.960 align:start position:0%
further discussion on the bill
 
01:17:36.590 --> 01:17:36.600 align:start position:0%
oh representative blame
 
01:17:38.630 --> 01:17:38.640 align:start position:0%
um I just want to Echo representative
 
01:17:41.390 --> 01:17:41.400 align:start position:0%
Howard's statements I also wanted to
 
01:17:46.850 --> 01:17:46.860 align:start position:0%
bring to light that RSA 659 131c which
 
01:17:48.890 --> 01:17:48.900 align:start position:0%
is the bill that this would override and
 
01:17:51.890 --> 01:17:51.900 align:start position:0%
get rid of has other constitutional
 
01:17:55.130 --> 01:17:55.140 align:start position:0%
problems with it which we heard about in
 
01:17:57.310 --> 01:17:57.320 align:start position:0%
the testimony
 
01:17:59.390 --> 01:17:59.400 align:start position:0%
also there's
 
01:18:02.689 --> 01:18:02.699 align:start position:0%
um there it is not a secret ballot it is
 
01:18:05.450 --> 01:18:05.460 align:start position:0%
marked by the moderator so there's no
 
01:18:08.870 --> 01:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
longer a secret ballot which I think is
 
01:18:11.630 --> 01:18:11.640 align:start position:0%
a huge violation of just tradition and
 
01:18:13.130 --> 01:18:13.140 align:start position:0%
it may well be a constitutional
 
01:18:15.470 --> 01:18:15.480 align:start position:0%
violation I don't know I'm not a
 
01:18:17.930 --> 01:18:17.940 align:start position:0%
constitutional lawyer
 
01:18:20.209 --> 01:18:20.219 align:start position:0%
um the fact that the ballot is marked by
 
01:18:23.530 --> 01:18:23.540 align:start position:0%
the moderator is a violation of RSA
 
01:18:27.229 --> 01:18:27.239 align:start position:0%
65616 which was brought forward uh to
 
01:18:28.850 --> 01:18:28.860 align:start position:0%
the attention of this committee when it
 
01:18:32.330 --> 01:18:32.340 align:start position:0%
heard it last year but was ignored
 
01:18:34.130 --> 01:18:34.140 align:start position:0%
um the the other thing that was asked
 
01:18:36.290 --> 01:18:36.300 align:start position:0%
that the bill be put to and again an
 
01:18:38.750 --> 01:18:38.760 align:start position:0%
opinion from either the AG's office when
 
01:18:41.330 --> 01:18:41.340 align:start position:0%
it was in the Senate the AG's office or
 
01:18:44.149 --> 01:18:44.159 align:start position:0%
from the Supreme Court but
 
01:18:47.750 --> 01:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
um the um the Senate Republicans decided
 
01:18:50.870 --> 01:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
they did not want to do that so I just
 
01:18:52.490 --> 01:18:52.500 align:start position:0%
wanted to put that out there that those
 
01:18:55.070 --> 01:18:55.080 align:start position:0%
were other issues that were confronting
 
01:18:57.470 --> 01:18:57.480 align:start position:0%
it and as representative Howard
 
01:19:00.350 --> 01:19:00.360 align:start position:0%
mentioned we're dealing with the
 
01:19:02.810 --> 01:19:02.820 align:start position:0%
primary as it stands now and yes we have
 
01:19:06.110 --> 01:19:06.120 align:start position:0%
56 days this year but what happens when
 
01:19:09.050 --> 01:19:09.060 align:start position:0%
you have recounts and what happens uh
 
01:19:11.110 --> 01:19:11.120 align:start position:0%
when you don't have 56 days
 
01:19:15.830 --> 01:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:17.290 --> 01:19:17.300 align:start position:0%
there's a discussion on the bill
 
01:19:19.729 --> 01:19:19.739 align:start position:0%
representative Barry addressed a couple
 
01:19:22.490 --> 01:19:22.500 align:start position:0%
things here um so the recount issue the
 
01:19:26.209 --> 01:19:26.219 align:start position:0%
recount issue is in play irregardless We
 
01:19:28.729 --> 01:19:28.739 align:start position:0%
Are One Statewide recount away from not
 
01:19:32.149 --> 01:19:32.159 align:start position:0%
meeting you okava in 2016
 
01:19:34.310 --> 01:19:34.320 align:start position:0%
um then state representative edelblue
 
01:19:36.590 --> 01:19:36.600 align:start position:0%
lost to then executive counselor Chris
 
01:19:38.689 --> 01:19:38.699 align:start position:0%
sununu by less than a thousand votes he
 
01:19:40.550 --> 01:19:40.560 align:start position:0%
would have been well in his rights to
 
01:19:43.130 --> 01:19:43.140 align:start position:0%
request a Statewide primary recount and
 
01:19:45.770 --> 01:19:45.780 align:start position:0%
we would have not made you okaba so if
 
01:19:47.270 --> 01:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
we're going to use that as a reason to
 
01:19:49.490 --> 01:19:49.500 align:start position:0%
vote for this bill you got to fix a
 
01:19:51.770 --> 01:19:51.780 align:start position:0%
whole lot of other things too as to the
 
01:19:53.750 --> 01:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
secret ballot your ballot is only
 
01:19:55.310 --> 01:19:55.320 align:start position:0%
revealed if you do not meet the
 
01:19:57.649 --> 01:19:57.659 align:start position:0%
requirements to to be a registered voter
 
01:20:00.050 --> 01:20:00.060 align:start position:0%
so somebody whose ballot is pulled out
 
01:20:01.370 --> 01:20:01.380 align:start position:0%
and the number has changed and their
 
01:20:03.229 --> 01:20:03.239 align:start position:0%
vote revealed should not have had their
 
01:20:05.090 --> 01:20:05.100 align:start position:0%
ballot in their otherwise they didn't
 
01:20:07.310 --> 01:20:07.320 align:start position:0%
prove who they were that they were who
 
01:20:08.450 --> 01:20:08.460 align:start position:0%
they said they were when they registered
 
01:20:10.430 --> 01:20:10.440 align:start position:0%
they were not a qualified voter
 
01:20:12.709 --> 01:20:12.719 align:start position:0%
underneath New Hampshire statutes so
 
01:20:14.570 --> 01:20:14.580 align:start position:0%
they are not afforded those protections
 
01:20:16.310 --> 01:20:16.320 align:start position:0%
because their ballot should have never
 
01:20:20.330 --> 01:20:20.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:22.910 --> 01:20:22.920 align:start position:0%
further discussion on the bill
 
01:20:25.130 --> 01:20:25.140 align:start position:0%
representative quilly
 
01:20:26.870 --> 01:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I heard a
 
01:20:30.229 --> 01:20:30.239 align:start position:0%
reference in a comment just now to birth
 
01:20:32.930 --> 01:20:32.940 align:start position:0%
certificates and passports it's my
 
01:20:35.450 --> 01:20:35.460 align:start position:0%
recollection that the law currently
 
01:20:37.189 --> 01:20:37.199 align:start position:0%
makes no reference to proof of
 
01:20:38.810 --> 01:20:38.820 align:start position:0%
citizenship it's merely proof of
 
01:20:38.820 --> 01:20:40.310 align:start position:0%
citizenship it's merely proof of
identity

01:20:40.310 --> 01:20:40.320 align:start position:0%
identity
 
01:20:43.070 --> 01:20:43.080 align:start position:0%
so passports and birth certificates
 
01:20:45.890 --> 01:20:45.900 align:start position:0%
don't enter into any possibility of
 
01:20:50.930 --> 01:20:50.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:53.390 --> 01:20:53.400 align:start position:0%
representative Muirhead
 
01:20:56.330 --> 01:20:56.340 align:start position:0%
said to to qualify to vote my
 
01:20:59.990 --> 01:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
understanding is one needs to prove
 
01:21:04.310 --> 01:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
identity age residence and citizenship
 
01:21:04.320 --> 01:21:05.090 align:start position:0%
identity age residence and citizenship
um

01:21:05.090 --> 01:21:05.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:08.209 --> 01:21:08.219 align:start position:0%
and that citizenship is attested to when
 
01:21:10.910 --> 01:21:10.920 align:start position:0%
registers Often by affidavit if one
 
01:21:12.770 --> 01:21:12.780 align:start position:0%
registers more than 30 days before an
 
01:21:12.780 --> 01:21:14.649 align:start position:0%
registers more than 30 days before an
election

01:21:14.649 --> 01:21:14.659 align:start position:0%
election
 
01:21:19.070 --> 01:21:19.080 align:start position:0%
and uh and and uh and if this bill does
 
01:21:21.169 --> 01:21:21.179 align:start position:0%
not address citizenship and does not
 
01:21:24.290 --> 01:21:24.300 align:start position:0%
require any proof of citizenship I think
 
01:21:25.850 --> 01:21:25.860 align:start position:0%
we need to enter that into the
 
01:21:29.090 --> 01:21:29.100 align:start position:0%
legislative record explicitly
 
01:21:29.100 --> 01:21:32.330 align:start position:0%
legislative record explicitly
foreign

01:21:32.330 --> 01:21:32.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:32.340 --> 01:21:34.850 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:21:34.850 --> 01:21:34.860 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:21:36.950 --> 01:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
the motion is an experience to legislate
 
01:21:39.229 --> 01:21:39.239 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 502. the clerk will call

report template that I sent

in the statement of intent portion
 
01:25:46.669 --> 01:25:46.679 align:start position:0%
that's where you put the motion you
 
01:25:49.070 --> 01:25:49.080 align:start position:0%
support and why and I'll merge the two
 
01:25:52.430 --> 01:25:52.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:54.649 --> 01:25:54.659 align:start position:0%
hey representation
 
01:25:57.590 --> 01:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
uh in a similar vein I have not uh
 
01:26:00.229 --> 01:26:00.239 align:start position:0%
submitted the report for HP 508 uh
 
01:26:02.209 --> 01:26:02.219 align:start position:0%
because I would actually like to move
 
01:26:10.570 --> 01:26:10.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:14.030 --> 01:26:14.040 align:start position:0%
so five 508 you were supposed to write
 
01:26:15.649 --> 01:26:15.659 align:start position:0%
the report yes
 
01:26:20.090 --> 01:26:20.100 align:start position:0%
and I missed that you did not do that
 
01:26:23.030 --> 01:26:23.040 align:start position:0%
that will never ever happen again
 
01:26:25.610 --> 01:26:25.620 align:start position:0%
committee report so it's like I guess
 
01:26:27.050 --> 01:26:27.060 align:start position:0%
I'll just State at this clearly when
 
01:26:29.930 --> 01:26:29.940 align:start position:0%
committee reports are due the day
 
01:26:32.390 --> 01:26:32.400 align:start position:0%
that we do the executive session I
 
01:26:34.729 --> 01:26:34.739 align:start position:0%
simply will not accept them after that
 
01:26:37.850 --> 01:26:37.860 align:start position:0%
if necessary I'll write them myself put
 
01:26:39.350 --> 01:26:39.360 align:start position:0%
my name on it and that's how that's
 
01:26:44.090 --> 01:26:44.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:47.750 --> 01:26:47.760 align:start position:0%

would you like to speak to your motion
 
01:30:06.110 --> 01:30:06.120 align:start position:0%
yes thank you uh while I share a lot of
 
01:30:08.090 --> 01:30:08.100 align:start position:0%
the uh questions that were brought up by
 
01:30:10.490 --> 01:30:10.500 align:start position:0%
representative panic and the bill
 
01:30:13.490 --> 01:30:13.500 align:start position:0%
supporters about the 2020 and the 2022
 
01:30:16.010 --> 01:30:16.020 align:start position:0%
election I'm concerned with the scope of
 
01:30:17.990 --> 01:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
the bill and the undefined portions of
 
01:30:19.129 --> 01:30:19.139 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
01:30:21.410 --> 01:30:21.420 align:start position:0%
uh section four in particular the
 
01:30:24.770 --> 01:30:24.780 align:start position:0%
authorization of an unidentified auditor
 
01:30:27.229 --> 01:30:27.239 align:start position:0%
developing a process to determine and
 
01:30:29.689 --> 01:30:29.699 align:start position:0%
involving 15 towns and for restless
 
01:30:33.290 --> 01:30:33.300 align:start position:0%
audits brings up much concerns on my pot
 
01:30:35.450 --> 01:30:35.460 align:start position:0%
especially when compared to the time and
 
01:30:39.110 --> 01:30:39.120 align:start position:0%
money spent on the Wyndham audit which
 
01:30:41.510 --> 01:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
had a very narrow focus a much narrower
 
01:30:44.510 --> 01:30:44.520 align:start position:0%
than the no Focus right that it has
 
01:30:47.090 --> 01:30:47.100 align:start position:0%
right now so with these concerns I move
 
01:30:52.310 --> 01:30:52.320 align:start position:0%
HB 599 as an inexperience to legislate
 
01:30:55.610 --> 01:30:55.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:55.620 --> 01:30:57.770 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:30:57.770 --> 01:30:57.780 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:30:59.750 --> 01:30:59.760 align:start position:0%

01:31:02.090 --> 01:31:02.100 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 599 clerk will call the
 
01:31:06.709 --> 01:31:06.719 align:start position:0%

03:07:00.590 --> 03:07:00.600 align:start position:0%
this is amazing uh New Hampshire ranks
 
03:07:02.030 --> 03:07:02.040 align:start position:0%
number one in the country for college
 
03:07:05.210 --> 03:07:05.220 align:start position:0%
students as a percent of the overall
 
03:07:05.220 --> 03:07:07.250 align:start position:0%
students as a percent of the overall
population

03:07:07.250 --> 03:07:07.260 align:start position:0%
population
 
03:07:09.710 --> 03:07:09.720 align:start position:0%
at over 10 and a half percent of the
 
03:07:12.469 --> 03:07:12.479 align:start position:0%
whole population more than half of the

03:07:16.910 --> 03:07:16.920 align:start position:0%
other states and countries
 
03:07:21.769 --> 03:07:21.779 align:start position:0%
as this group is 90 is the 99 voting age
 
03:07:24.290 --> 03:07:24.300 align:start position:0%
um and with such a large number they
 
03:07:27.050 --> 03:07:27.060 align:start position:0%
have a huge influence on our elections
 
03:07:30.050 --> 03:07:30.060 align:start position:0%
we want to encourage our young people to
 
03:07:32.929 --> 03:07:32.939 align:start position:0%
vote and this is a time of a life
 
03:07:35.570 --> 03:07:35.580 align:start position:0%
we're learning to participate in the
 
03:07:38.510 --> 03:07:38.520 align:start position:0%
election process is foundational and
 
03:07:38.520 --> 03:07:39.650 align:start position:0%
election process is foundational and
important

03:07:39.650 --> 03:07:39.660 align:start position:0%
important
 
03:07:42.650 --> 03:07:42.660 align:start position:0%
at the same time we also want the
 
03:07:46.250 --> 03:07:46.260 align:start position:0%
elections to be the reflection
 
03:07:48.429 --> 03:07:48.439 align:start position:0%
of those who reside in New Hampshire
 
03:07:51.349 --> 03:07:51.359 align:start position:0%
towns and who ultimately be the
 
03:07:54.170 --> 03:07:54.180 align:start position:0%
consequences of the election results
 
03:07:56.389 --> 03:07:56.399 align:start position:0%
today the university system of New
 
03:07:58.490 --> 03:07:58.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has 18
 
03:08:00.790 --> 03:08:00.800 align:start position:0%
000 out of
 
03:08:03.050 --> 03:08:03.060 align:start position:0%
out-of-state students
 
03:08:05.990 --> 03:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
in our universities and colleges
 
03:08:09.410 --> 03:08:09.420 align:start position:0%
in the 2022 midterm elections this
 
03:08:12.349 --> 03:08:12.359 align:start position:0%
out-of-state group represented over 11
 
03:08:15.950 --> 03:08:15.960 align:start position:0%
of all votes cast for candidates
 
03:08:17.870 --> 03:08:17.880 align:start position:0%
these students if voting in New
 
03:08:20.330 --> 03:08:20.340 align:start position:0%
Hampshire elections could determine the
 
03:08:23.330 --> 03:08:23.340 align:start position:0%
election outcomes and the tension points
 
03:08:25.610 --> 03:08:25.620 align:start position:0%
must be balanced to encourage voting
 
03:08:27.590 --> 03:08:27.600 align:start position:0%
while not preventing the
 
03:08:29.870 --> 03:08:29.880 align:start position:0%
disenfranchisement of New Hampshire
 
03:08:29.880 --> 03:08:31.190 align:start position:0%
disenfranchisement of New Hampshire
voices

03:08:31.190 --> 03:08:31.200 align:start position:0%
voices
 
03:08:33.950 --> 03:08:33.960 align:start position:0%
one method to address this issue is a
 
03:08:35.690 --> 03:08:35.700 align:start position:0%
simple approach
 
03:08:38.330 --> 03:08:38.340 align:start position:0%
with the help of a college system
 
03:08:40.849 --> 03:08:40.859 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire college system has a
 
03:08:43.670 --> 03:08:43.680 align:start position:0%
clear outline for qualifying for
 
03:08:47.269 --> 03:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
discounted tuition for in-state students
 
03:08:50.389 --> 03:08:50.399 align:start position:0%
while also identifying those students
 
03:08:53.929 --> 03:08:53.939 align:start position:0%
who are domiciled in other states or
 
03:08:57.469 --> 03:08:57.479 align:start position:0%
countries using this distinction this
 
03:09:00.349 --> 03:09:00.359 align:start position:0%
bill would use the students in-state
 
03:09:02.889 --> 03:09:02.899 align:start position:0%
tuition bill at the time of registration
 
03:09:07.670 --> 03:09:07.680 align:start position:0%
to qualify as a New Hampshire voter the
 
03:09:09.650 --> 03:09:09.660 align:start position:0%
secretary of state would be supplied a
 
03:09:12.349 --> 03:09:12.359 align:start position:0%
list of college students eligible to
 
03:09:14.030 --> 03:09:14.040 align:start position:0%
vote in New Hampshire from the
 
03:09:16.610 --> 03:09:16.620 align:start position:0%
University system students who are from
 
03:09:19.429 --> 03:09:19.439 align:start position:0%
other states would participate in their
 
03:09:21.710 --> 03:09:21.720 align:start position:0%
home state elections through their
 
03:09:26.210 --> 03:09:26.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:26.220 --> 03:09:28.010 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:09:28.010 --> 03:09:28.020 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
03:09:30.170 --> 03:09:30.180 align:start position:0%
if you have any questions I'd be happy
 
03:09:32.150 --> 03:09:32.160 align:start position:0%
to answer them if I can
 
03:09:33.769 --> 03:09:33.779 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions yes
 
03:09:35.750 --> 03:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
representative Howard thank you Mr
 
03:09:37.910 --> 03:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
chairman and uh thank you for uh sharing
 
03:09:40.730 --> 03:09:40.740 align:start position:0%
your thoughts today uh my question uh
 
03:09:42.469 --> 03:09:42.479 align:start position:0%
revolves around the fact that uh I guess
 
03:09:44.690 --> 03:09:44.700 align:start position:0%
more of a hypothetical I'm a student
 
03:09:46.190 --> 03:09:46.200 align:start position:0%
currently at the University of New
 
03:09:48.349 --> 03:09:48.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in Durham I've resided in the
 
03:09:51.730 --> 03:09:51.740 align:start position:0%
town of Stratford for my entire life uh
 
03:09:54.650 --> 03:09:54.660 align:start position:0%
and just to kind of read off from the
 
03:09:56.750 --> 03:09:56.760 align:start position:0%
bill here I qualify for in-state tuition
 
03:09:58.670 --> 03:09:58.680 align:start position:0%
would this mean that I'd have to provide
 
03:10:00.769 --> 03:10:00.779 align:start position:0%
a copy of my tuition bill when I go to
 
03:10:03.230 --> 03:10:03.240 align:start position:0%
the Stratford Town Hall not if you're an
 
03:10:06.110 --> 03:10:06.120 align:start position:0%
in-state okay I think there was a um I
 
03:10:08.330 --> 03:10:08.340 align:start position:0%
think there was a an error on this bill
 
03:10:11.210 --> 03:10:11.220 align:start position:0%
when it was uh proposed this should be
 
03:10:15.410 --> 03:10:15.420 align:start position:0%
asking just for out-of-state students to
 
03:10:15.420 --> 03:10:17.690 align:start position:0%
asking just for out-of-state students to
provide

03:10:17.690 --> 03:10:17.700 align:start position:0%
provide
 
03:10:20.870 --> 03:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
okay proof of where they're out of state
 
03:10:20.880 --> 03:10:22.309 align:start position:0%
okay proof of where they're out of state
residents

03:10:22.309 --> 03:10:22.319 align:start position:0%
residents
 
03:10:24.530 --> 03:10:24.540 align:start position:0%
so this bill has been drafted up
 
03:10:27.230 --> 03:10:27.240 align:start position:0%
erroneously I just caught this the other
 
03:10:27.240 --> 03:10:30.050 align:start position:0%
erroneously I just caught this the other
day

03:10:30.050 --> 03:10:30.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:33.110 --> 03:10:33.120 align:start position:0%
yeah it says in-state voters and the
 
03:10:35.150 --> 03:10:35.160 align:start position:0%
community college system shall provide a
 
03:10:37.269 --> 03:10:37.279 align:start position:0%
student list of eligible in-states
 
03:10:39.650 --> 03:10:39.660 align:start position:0%
voters to the Secretary of State it
 
03:10:42.730 --> 03:10:42.740 align:start position:0%
should say ineligible
 
03:10:45.410 --> 03:10:45.420 align:start position:0%
in-state students
 
03:10:50.389 --> 03:10:50.399 align:start position:0%
we have a typo here that I just caught
 
03:10:52.010 --> 03:10:52.020 align:start position:0%
so that changes the meaning of the bill
 
03:10:54.170 --> 03:10:54.180 align:start position:0%
yeah follow up
 
03:10:57.950 --> 03:10:57.960 align:start position:0%
uh so since uh students would need to be
 
03:10:59.630 --> 03:10:59.640 align:start position:0%
providing a copy of their tuition would
 
03:11:06.590 --> 03:11:06.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:08.690 --> 03:11:08.700 align:start position:0%
dependent students in the case of the
 
03:11:10.370 --> 03:11:10.380 align:start position:0%
students is still support that are
 
03:11:12.170 --> 03:11:12.180 align:start position:0%
supported by their parents in a drama
 
03:11:14.510 --> 03:11:14.520 align:start position:0%
style is the family home with the
 
03:11:16.790 --> 03:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
parents in New Hampshire proof provided
 
03:11:19.190 --> 03:11:19.200 align:start position:0%
to the universities a notarized letter
 
03:11:21.830 --> 03:11:21.840 align:start position:0%

03:11:24.469 --> 03:11:24.479 align:start position:0%

03:11:26.870 --> 03:11:26.880 align:start position:0%

03:11:51.110 --> 03:11:51.120 align:start position:0%

registration

03:11:57.290 --> 03:11:57.300 align:start position:0%
registration
 
03:12:00.230 --> 03:12:00.240 align:start position:0%
the colleges do have you know they they
 
03:12:04.190 --> 03:12:04.200 align:start position:0%
they they have a tuition for rate for
 
03:12:06.650 --> 03:12:06.660 align:start position:0%
in-state students and out-of-state
 
03:12:09.590 --> 03:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
students so if we can get that out of
 
03:12:12.530 --> 03:12:12.540 align:start position:0%
State student identified and given that
 
03:12:15.170 --> 03:12:15.180 align:start position:0%
to our secretary of state that's a block
 
03:12:17.330 --> 03:12:17.340 align:start position:0%
of Voters that we can ensure that
 
03:12:18.830 --> 03:12:18.840 align:start position:0%
they're going to vote where they're
 
03:12:20.870 --> 03:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
appropriately supposed to be voting and
 
03:12:22.490 --> 03:12:22.500 align:start position:0%
they have to do mail if they have to do
 
03:12:24.889 --> 03:12:24.899 align:start position:0%
absentee voting for another state that's
 
03:12:26.809 --> 03:12:26.819 align:start position:0%
you know in their home state that's okay
 
03:12:29.630 --> 03:12:29.640 align:start position:0%
but we're trying to predict protect you
 
03:12:32.690 --> 03:12:32.700 align:start position:0%
know our vote here
 
03:12:34.910 --> 03:12:34.920 align:start position:0%
thank you anybody else did I answer any
 
03:12:37.790 --> 03:12:37.800 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative
 
03:12:39.530 --> 03:12:39.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
03:12:41.450 --> 03:12:41.460 align:start position:0%
um and thank you representative
 
03:12:44.330 --> 03:12:44.340 align:start position:0%
um what your bill only covers uh state
 
03:12:46.550 --> 03:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
universities and state what about all
 
03:12:54.110 --> 03:12:54.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:56.269 --> 03:12:56.279 align:start position:0%
my understanding is this is supposed to
 
03:12:58.969 --> 03:12:58.979 align:start position:0%
cover all the universities
 
03:13:03.530 --> 03:13:03.540 align:start position:0%
uh in-state in-state tuition
 
03:13:05.750 --> 03:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
my understanding is this is covering all
 
03:13:08.150 --> 03:13:08.160 align:start position:0%
the universities in New Hampshire in the
 
03:13:14.269 --> 03:13:14.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:17.269 --> 03:13:17.279 align:start position:0%
the thing is that Saint anselms and
 
03:13:19.849 --> 03:13:19.859 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth schools like that do not have
 
03:13:21.950 --> 03:13:21.960 align:start position:0%
in-state they're not State institutions
 
03:13:24.469 --> 03:13:24.479 align:start position:0%
they don't differentiate between New
 
03:13:26.030 --> 03:13:26.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents and those outside
 
03:13:29.630 --> 03:13:29.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:32.750 --> 03:13:32.760 align:start position:0%
they must have some type of registration
 
03:13:35.210 --> 03:13:35.220 align:start position:0%
where the shows where the student
 
03:13:35.220 --> 03:13:37.790 align:start position:0%
where the shows where the student
resides

03:13:37.790 --> 03:13:37.800 align:start position:0%
resides
 
03:13:44.090 --> 03:13:44.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:46.309 --> 03:13:46.319 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
03:13:48.170 --> 03:13:48.180 align:start position:0%
well thank you representative all right
 
03:13:49.490 --> 03:13:49.500 align:start position:0%

also from Stratford County
um

03:14:29.929 --> 03:14:29.939 align:start position:0%

03:14:31.790 --> 03:14:31.800 align:start position:0%
so I was
 
03:14:33.410 --> 03:14:33.420 align:start position:0%
so I've got some written testimony here
 
03:14:35.510 --> 03:14:35.520 align:start position:0%
which I think I emailed to you I also
 
03:14:37.130 --> 03:14:37.140 align:start position:0%
put it on the website and I'm passing
 
03:14:38.630 --> 03:14:38.640 align:start position:0%
hard copies around
 
03:14:38.640 --> 03:14:39.650 align:start position:0%
hard copies around
um

03:14:39.650 --> 03:14:39.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:14:42.710 --> 03:14:42.720 align:start position:0%
and um that's like a belted suspenders
 
03:14:45.110 --> 03:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
and second belt approach um
 
03:14:47.030 --> 03:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
and uh well first of all I was talking
 
03:14:48.290 --> 03:14:48.300 align:start position:0%
this morning about residents and
 
03:14:49.910 --> 03:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
domiciles I think some of what you heard
 
03:14:51.590 --> 03:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
about residents they're trying to
 
03:14:55.250 --> 03:14:55.260 align:start position:0%
redefine residents from what it actually
 
03:14:57.710 --> 03:14:57.720 align:start position:0%
means legally so uh
 
03:14:59.990 --> 03:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
so what I said and I refer to that here
 
03:15:02.030 --> 03:15:02.040 align:start position:0%
my written testimony actually which is a
 
03:15:02.040 --> 03:15:03.170 align:start position:0%
my written testimony actually which is a
typically

03:15:03.170 --> 03:15:03.180 align:start position:0%
typically
 
03:15:05.630 --> 03:15:05.640 align:start position:0%
live on their campus or nearby for 9 to
 
03:15:06.950 --> 03:15:06.960 align:start position:0%
12 months out of the year they're
 
03:15:08.750 --> 03:15:08.760 align:start position:0%
physically present in the community and
 
03:15:10.190 --> 03:15:10.200 align:start position:0%
that's really enough right there to
 
03:15:11.990 --> 03:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
establish residents in domicile they
 
03:15:13.389 --> 03:15:13.399 align:start position:0%
work there and pay taxes and Community
 
03:15:16.550 --> 03:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
the Census Bureau counts them at their
 
03:15:18.590 --> 03:15:18.600 align:start position:0%
on or off campus residence and I speak
 
03:15:19.969 --> 03:15:19.979 align:start position:0%
from personal experience because I used
 
03:15:21.650 --> 03:15:21.660 align:start position:0%
to work for I worked on two to San Diego
 
03:15:24.230 --> 03:15:24.240 align:start position:0%
census for the Census Bureau in fact
 
03:15:27.230 --> 03:15:27.240 align:start position:0%
one of the major post-census activities
 
03:15:28.849 --> 03:15:28.859 align:start position:0%
is uh
 
03:15:31.190 --> 03:15:31.200 align:start position:0%
tracking down hundreds of thousands of
 
03:15:34.670 --> 03:15:34.680 align:start position:0%
duplicate entries for students who uh
 
03:15:36.950 --> 03:15:36.960 align:start position:0%
either fill out a question form or gets
 
03:15:38.630 --> 03:15:38.640 align:start position:0%
counted on campus but you also get
 
03:15:41.090 --> 03:15:41.100 align:start position:0%
counted at their parents house and as
 
03:15:43.490 --> 03:15:43.500 align:start position:0%
the entry at the parents house which is
 
03:15:45.230 --> 03:15:45.240 align:start position:0%
actually the duplicate record that needs
 
03:15:47.150 --> 03:15:47.160 align:start position:0%
to be removed not the one at the on
 
03:15:50.450 --> 03:15:50.460 align:start position:0%
campus or off-campus residence and um
 
03:15:54.730 --> 03:15:54.740 align:start position:0%
the RSA that this would amend is RSA 654
 
03:15:58.190 --> 03:15:58.200 align:start position:0%
uh one Roman numeral one
 
03:16:00.830 --> 03:16:00.840 align:start position:0%
a and that actually flips the meaning of
 
03:16:02.570 --> 03:16:02.580 align:start position:0%
the existing law totally on its head I
 
03:16:03.710 --> 03:16:03.720 align:start position:0%
was actually a member of House election
 
03:16:07.070 --> 03:16:07.080 align:start position:0%
law my first term back in 2009
 
03:16:10.450 --> 03:16:10.460 align:start position:0%
uh when that RSA was 64
 
03:16:14.510 --> 03:16:14.520 align:start position:0%
654 colon 1 Roman numeral 1A was added
 
03:16:17.750 --> 03:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
by hb614 and that was a long time ago
 
03:16:19.790 --> 03:16:19.800 align:start position:0%
but I remember that hearing vividly uh
 
03:16:21.469 --> 03:16:21.479 align:start position:0%
and the purpose of the bill is actually
 
03:16:23.210 --> 03:16:23.220 align:start position:0%
to affirm students voting rights as
 
03:16:25.070 --> 03:16:25.080 align:start position:0%
established by the previous sub-chapters
 
03:16:27.769 --> 03:16:27.779 align:start position:0%
the RSA which you would not be surprised
 
03:16:29.389 --> 03:16:29.399 align:start position:0%
I tell you that which that was pretty
 
03:16:32.929 --> 03:16:32.939 align:start position:0%
obvious RSA 654 colon 1 Roman numeral
 
03:16:34.910 --> 03:16:34.920 align:start position:0%
one and many other state and federal
 
03:16:36.349 --> 03:16:36.359 align:start position:0%
laws and
 
03:16:38.570 --> 03:16:38.580 align:start position:0%
we had very interesting hearing way back
 
03:16:40.150 --> 03:16:40.160 align:start position:0%
then and there's even one gentleman
 
03:16:43.849 --> 03:16:43.859 align:start position:0%
who'd ran Plymouth and lost because he
 
03:16:46.070 --> 03:16:46.080 align:start position:0%
didn't do a good job of get getting the
 
03:16:48.769 --> 03:16:48.779 align:start position:0%
students to vote for him he wanted us to
 
03:16:50.450 --> 03:16:50.460 align:start position:0%
exclude the students because he felt he
 
03:16:51.950 --> 03:16:51.960 align:start position:0%
should have rightfully won and that's
 
03:16:54.710 --> 03:16:54.720 align:start position:0%
not how the system works so if you have
 
03:16:56.929 --> 03:16:56.939 align:start position:0%
students or any other group of Music the
 
03:16:59.330 --> 03:16:59.340 align:start position:0%
thing to do is to try to appeal to them
 
03:17:01.309 --> 03:17:01.319 align:start position:0%
try to get them to vote for you
 
03:17:01.319 --> 03:17:01.969 align:start position:0%
try to get them to vote for you
um

03:17:01.969 --> 03:17:01.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:17:04.190 --> 03:17:04.200 align:start position:0%
there were two constitutional law cases
 
03:17:06.050 --> 03:17:06.060 align:start position:0%
at least one of which was specifically
 
03:17:07.690 --> 03:17:07.700 align:start position:0%
mentioned this morning the other Bill
 
03:17:10.490 --> 03:17:10.500 align:start position:0%
neuberger versus Peterson that was the
 
03:17:14.510 --> 03:17:14.520 align:start position:0%
uh Dartmouth student from Hawaii who
 
03:17:14.520 --> 03:17:15.230 align:start position:0%
uh Dartmouth student from Hawaii who
um

03:17:15.230 --> 03:17:15.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:17:18.410 --> 03:17:18.420 align:start position:0%
anyway he was either unable or unwilling
 
03:17:20.450 --> 03:17:20.460 align:start position:0%
to uh vote back home the version of
 
03:17:21.950 --> 03:17:21.960 align:start position:0%
Story I Heard which was from Secretary
 
03:17:23.510 --> 03:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
of State gardeners that his parents had
 
03:17:25.070 --> 03:17:25.080 align:start position:0%
died so he wasn't eligible to vote in
 
03:17:26.750 --> 03:17:26.760 align:start position:0%
Hawaii but in any case
 
03:17:28.730 --> 03:17:28.740 align:start position:0%
he wasn't going back to Hawaii and he
 
03:17:30.110 --> 03:17:30.120 align:start position:0%
probably wasn't going to hand over but
 
03:17:32.630 --> 03:17:32.640 align:start position:0%
he wanted to vote in Hanover and then
 
03:17:35.090 --> 03:17:35.100 align:start position:0%
the Federal Court ruled that he he had
 
03:17:36.889 --> 03:17:36.899 align:start position:0%
every right to do so there's also Sims
 
03:17:38.690 --> 03:17:38.700 align:start position:0%
versus U.S
 
03:17:42.349 --> 03:17:42.359 align:start position:0%
and um Sims was a county I think he was
 
03:17:44.929 --> 03:17:44.939 align:start position:0%
a County Registrar in a Suburban county
 
03:17:46.790 --> 03:17:46.800 align:start position:0%
of Houston which is predominantly white
 
03:17:49.670 --> 03:17:49.680 align:start position:0%
but has a famous black uh historically
 
03:17:52.190 --> 03:17:52.200 align:start position:0%
back college or university Prairie View
 
03:17:54.769 --> 03:17:54.779 align:start position:0%
and he was trying to prevent the Prairie
 
03:17:56.150 --> 03:17:56.160 align:start position:0%
View students from voting and whether
 
03:17:57.830 --> 03:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
he's doing that for racial reasons just
 
03:17:59.870 --> 03:17:59.880 align:start position:0%
for anti-student voting reasons isn't
 
03:18:02.929 --> 03:18:02.939 align:start position:0%
really relevant the uh although that did
 
03:18:04.610 --> 03:18:04.620 align:start position:0%
make the case that much more
 
03:18:06.889 --> 03:18:06.899 align:start position:0%
controversial but so that clearly
 
03:18:08.570 --> 03:18:08.580 align:start position:0%
established way back near I graduated
 
03:18:10.070 --> 03:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
from college that students have the
 
03:18:11.210 --> 03:18:11.220 align:start position:0%
right to vote in the place where they
 
03:18:13.730 --> 03:18:13.740 align:start position:0%
live when they're going to college and
 
03:18:13.740 --> 03:18:14.690 align:start position:0%
live when they're going to college and
um

03:18:14.690 --> 03:18:14.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:18:16.429 --> 03:18:16.439 align:start position:0%
aside from being constitutional bill is
 
03:18:19.010 --> 03:18:19.020 align:start position:0%
a bad idea I'll mention one well one
 
03:18:20.990 --> 03:18:21.000 align:start position:0%
basic one voting is a good habit so is
 
03:18:22.250 --> 03:18:22.260 align:start position:0%
being involved with your local community
 
03:18:23.690 --> 03:18:23.700 align:start position:0%
in other ways
 
03:18:25.990 --> 03:18:26.000 align:start position:0%
college is where young adults
 
03:18:28.010 --> 03:18:28.020 align:start position:0%
establish the habits of their future
 
03:18:29.809 --> 03:18:29.819 align:start position:0%
life both good and bad and this bill
 
03:18:31.490 --> 03:18:31.500 align:start position:0%
seems to be an expressly designed well I
 
03:18:33.830 --> 03:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
guess it was she said the prime sponsors
 
03:18:35.510 --> 03:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
said so this guy deserves college
 
03:18:37.790 --> 03:18:37.800 align:start position:0%
students from developing the habits of
 
03:18:39.349 --> 03:18:39.359 align:start position:0%
voting and Civic involvement although
 
03:18:40.550 --> 03:18:40.560 align:start position:0%
she did mention
 
03:18:42.530 --> 03:18:42.540 align:start position:0%
they could put absentee and Alicia thank
 
03:18:44.929 --> 03:18:44.939 align:start position:0%
you for not applying what we usually
 
03:18:46.250 --> 03:18:46.260 align:start position:0%
hear in these debates
 
03:18:49.670 --> 03:18:49.680 align:start position:0%
the adverb simply devoting by absentee
 
03:18:52.309 --> 03:18:52.319 align:start position:0%
voting absentee is not simple and most
 
03:18:53.990 --> 03:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
of the bills relate to absentee voting
 
03:18:56.929 --> 03:18:56.939 align:start position:0%
and designed to make it even less simple
 
03:18:59.389 --> 03:18:59.399 align:start position:0%
so absentee voting I mean it's lots of
 
03:19:01.130 --> 03:19:01.140 align:start position:0%
people do it it's not
 
03:19:02.929 --> 03:19:02.939 align:start position:0%
that complicated but it's not exactly
 
03:19:05.450 --> 03:19:05.460 align:start position:0%
like simple and
 
03:19:07.730 --> 03:19:07.740 align:start position:0%
the methodology is fatally flawed as we
 
03:19:09.050 --> 03:19:09.060 align:start position:0%
found out well really doing the
 
03:19:11.630 --> 03:19:11.640 align:start position:0%
questions he ignores the fact it
 
03:19:13.849 --> 03:19:13.859 align:start position:0%
um well first of all else in state
 
03:19:16.670 --> 03:19:16.680 align:start position:0%
tuition it's based primarily in where
 
03:19:18.290 --> 03:19:18.300 align:start position:0%
you lived before you enrolled in college
 
03:19:19.969 --> 03:19:19.979 align:start position:0%
although there actually are some some
 
03:19:19.979 --> 03:19:21.830 align:start position:0%
although there actually are some some
exceptions

03:19:21.830 --> 03:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
exceptions
 
03:19:23.929 --> 03:19:23.939 align:start position:0%
like to certain programs at state
 
03:19:26.030 --> 03:19:26.040 align:start position:0%
universities where you can get his state
 
03:19:27.469 --> 03:19:27.479 align:start position:0%
tuition even though your so-called
 
03:19:30.469 --> 03:19:30.479 align:start position:0%
out-of-state student
 
03:19:32.750 --> 03:19:32.760 align:start position:0%
um there's probably actually and there
 
03:19:34.309 --> 03:19:34.319 align:start position:0%
is the Assumption hidden behind this
 
03:19:37.070 --> 03:19:37.080 align:start position:0%
bill that every college student
 
03:19:38.690 --> 03:19:38.700 align:start position:0%
you know lives in their childhood home
 
03:19:40.730 --> 03:19:40.740 align:start position:0%
to their 18 they immediately head off to
 
03:19:43.550 --> 03:19:43.560 align:start position:0%
college and then immediately only stay
 
03:19:45.170 --> 03:19:45.180 align:start position:0%
in the college town for four years and
 
03:19:46.969 --> 03:19:46.979 align:start position:0%
then they go back home or whatever so
 
03:19:48.349 --> 03:19:48.359 align:start position:0%
that's not how
 
03:19:51.050 --> 03:19:51.060 align:start position:0%
most uh students institutions of higher
 
03:19:53.450 --> 03:19:53.460 align:start position:0%
education live their lives these days
 
03:19:55.070 --> 03:19:55.080 align:start position:0%
and even they did
 
03:19:58.309 --> 03:19:58.319 align:start position:0%
moving moving to a community to attend a
 
03:20:00.650 --> 03:20:00.660 align:start position:0%
College University there is as good a
 
03:20:03.170 --> 03:20:03.180 align:start position:0%
reason as any to move to that community
 
03:20:04.730 --> 03:20:04.740 align:start position:0%
so there's nothing illegitimate about
 
03:20:06.590 --> 03:20:06.600 align:start position:0%
that um
 
03:20:09.650 --> 03:20:09.660 align:start position:0%
and so and there's anyway so it's uh and
 
03:20:11.269 --> 03:20:11.279 align:start position:0%
see not even all that uncommon for a
 
03:20:13.370 --> 03:20:13.380 align:start position:0%
student to move to a college town you
 
03:20:15.590 --> 03:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
know establish a domicile
 
03:20:17.450 --> 03:20:17.460 align:start position:0%
and then later decides of Rome to
 
03:20:19.490 --> 03:20:19.500 align:start position:0%
college and actually that's a practical
 
03:20:20.929 --> 03:20:20.939 align:start position:0%
matter unless they're living in an
 
03:20:24.070 --> 03:20:24.080 align:start position:0%
on-campus residence you really have
 
03:20:27.170 --> 03:20:27.180 align:start position:0%
checklists have no really no way of like
 
03:20:28.490 --> 03:20:28.500 align:start position:0%
figuring out where the person actually
 
03:20:31.070 --> 03:20:31.080 align:start position:0%
is a student or not you know like we do
 
03:20:31.080 --> 03:20:32.090 align:start position:0%
is a student or not you know like we do
have

03:20:32.090 --> 03:20:32.100 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:20:33.950 --> 03:20:33.960 align:start position:0%
I mean some college towns we do have
 
03:20:35.870 --> 03:20:35.880 align:start position:0%
some primarily even if you live in one
 
03:20:38.030 --> 03:20:38.040 align:start position:0%
of those uh student housing complexes
 
03:20:39.830 --> 03:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
that they have on the outskirts of uh
 
03:20:41.690 --> 03:20:41.700 align:start position:0%
Durham not everyone
 
03:20:45.349 --> 03:20:45.359 align:start position:0%
those complexes is necessarily a student
 
03:20:46.969 --> 03:20:46.979 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
03:20:48.530 --> 03:20:48.540 align:start position:0%
and there probably are some and there
 
03:20:49.849 --> 03:20:49.859 align:start position:0%
are some people who live in dormitories
 
03:20:52.130 --> 03:20:52.140 align:start position:0%
who are like older people sometimes even
 
03:20:53.630 --> 03:20:53.640 align:start position:0%
with families and stuff who aren't
 
03:20:55.670 --> 03:20:55.680 align:start position:0%
necessarily students there's a few cases
 
03:20:56.809 --> 03:20:56.819 align:start position:0%
of that
 
03:21:00.950 --> 03:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
and um as we heard and we heard actually
 
03:21:03.590 --> 03:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
it's now been proven we the number we
 
03:21:05.030 --> 03:21:05.040 align:start position:0%
were just told by the prime sponsors
 
03:21:08.450 --> 03:21:08.460 align:start position:0%
there's 27 private institutions and 14
 
03:21:08.460 --> 03:21:09.349 align:start position:0%
there's 27 private institutions and 14
um

03:21:09.349 --> 03:21:09.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:21:12.110 --> 03:21:12.120 align:start position:0%
public institutions so that my math that
 
03:21:13.550 --> 03:21:13.560 align:start position:0%
means it's almost a two to one ratio
 
03:21:15.710 --> 03:21:15.720 align:start position:0%
private to public and even if we got the
 
03:21:17.570 --> 03:21:17.580 align:start position:0%
numbers backwards that's one-third is
 
03:21:19.849 --> 03:21:19.859 align:start position:0%
still a significant percentage so
 
03:21:22.250 --> 03:21:22.260 align:start position:0%
and there is no in-state tuition at a
 
03:21:24.830 --> 03:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
private private institution so what do
 
03:21:27.230 --> 03:21:27.240 align:start position:0%
you do about those um
 
03:21:28.250 --> 03:21:28.260 align:start position:0%
so I don't really know what
 
03:21:31.130 --> 03:21:31.140 align:start position:0%
documentation we expected when students
 
03:21:32.870 --> 03:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
at private colleges try to register to
 
03:21:34.550 --> 03:21:34.560 align:start position:0%
vote say if you're at Dartmouth or Saint
 
03:21:35.870 --> 03:21:35.880 align:start position:0%
anthems even if you're living in the
 
03:21:37.550 --> 03:21:37.560 align:start position:0%
dorm you know what
 
03:21:39.469 --> 03:21:39.479 align:start position:0%
as written there's nothing to say what
 
03:21:41.210 --> 03:21:41.220 align:start position:0%
sort of a documentation those people
 
03:21:41.220 --> 03:21:42.670 align:start position:0%
sort of a documentation those people
need

03:21:42.670 --> 03:21:42.680 align:start position:0%
need
 
03:21:45.590 --> 03:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
anyways there's also some students
 
03:21:47.690 --> 03:21:47.700 align:start position:0%
who live in New Hampshire during the
 
03:21:50.269 --> 03:21:50.279 align:start position:0%
school year or year round but whose main
 
03:21:52.730 --> 03:21:52.740 align:start position:0%
occupation is going to school in another
 
03:21:52.740 --> 03:21:53.809 align:start position:0%
occupation is going to school in another
state

03:21:53.809 --> 03:21:53.819 align:start position:0%
state
 
03:21:53.819 --> 03:21:54.889 align:start position:0%
state
um

03:21:54.889 --> 03:21:54.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:21:57.410 --> 03:21:57.420 align:start position:0%
we even have uh we even have one yet
 
03:21:58.670 --> 03:21:58.680 align:start position:0%
famous university here in New Hampshire
 
03:22:01.010 --> 03:22:01.020 align:start position:0%
whose campus spills over across the
 
03:22:02.809 --> 03:22:02.819 align:start position:0%
state lines the Dartmouth College campus
 
03:22:05.630 --> 03:22:05.640 align:start position:0%
it's mostly on the east side of the
 
03:22:08.630 --> 03:22:08.640 align:start position:0%
Connecticut River in Hampton but
 
03:22:10.969 --> 03:22:10.979 align:start position:0%
part of the campus is on the west side
 
03:22:13.070 --> 03:22:13.080 align:start position:0%
of the Connecticut River on the far side
 
03:22:15.110 --> 03:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
of the Ledyard Bridge or the near side
 
03:22:16.849 --> 03:22:16.859 align:start position:0%
depending whether you're from Vermont to
 
03:22:18.290 --> 03:22:18.300 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so
 
03:22:20.330 --> 03:22:20.340 align:start position:0%
that's a whole other complication like
 
03:22:22.309 --> 03:22:22.319 align:start position:0%
which which state
 
03:22:24.290 --> 03:22:24.300 align:start position:0%
you know Dartmouth College is physically
 
03:22:27.530 --> 03:22:27.540 align:start position:0%
located in both states and
 
03:22:29.570 --> 03:22:29.580 align:start position:0%
I guess that's primarily the Vermont's
 
03:22:31.250 --> 03:22:31.260 align:start position:0%
assemblies problem not ours so that's
 
03:22:32.809 --> 03:22:32.819 align:start position:0%
like some other election law committee
 
03:22:35.030 --> 03:22:35.040 align:start position:0%
to worry about so
 
03:22:37.130 --> 03:22:37.140 align:start position:0%
and um
 
03:22:39.349 --> 03:22:39.359 align:start position:0%
something that wasn't really hasn't
 
03:22:40.790 --> 03:22:40.800 align:start position:0%
really been mentioned yet I've heard in
 
03:22:43.190 --> 03:22:43.200 align:start position:0%
other bills and this topic is uh the
 
03:22:44.690 --> 03:22:44.700 align:start position:0%
out-of-state tuition
 
03:22:48.170 --> 03:22:48.180 align:start position:0%
it's twice the in-state tuition that UNH
 
03:22:49.969 --> 03:22:49.979 align:start position:0%
and most of the other state schools so
 
03:22:51.349 --> 03:22:51.359 align:start position:0%
it's a
 
03:22:53.510 --> 03:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
there's like uh because sometimes I've
 
03:22:54.530 --> 03:22:54.540 align:start position:0%
heard some
 
03:22:56.510 --> 03:22:56.520 align:start position:0%
at other debates on summer bills I heard
 
03:22:59.330 --> 03:22:59.340 align:start position:0%
like well these kids are playing out of
 
03:23:01.670 --> 03:23:01.680 align:start position:0%
state tuition you know they shouldn't be
 
03:23:03.410 --> 03:23:03.420 align:start position:0%
able to vote almost implications almost
 
03:23:04.910 --> 03:23:04.920 align:start position:0%
out of state tuition such a great
 
03:23:07.070 --> 03:23:07.080 align:start position:0%
privilege that like yes you know asking
 
03:23:08.870 --> 03:23:08.880 align:start position:0%
to be allowed to vote on top of it which
 
03:23:10.610 --> 03:23:10.620 align:start position:0%
is a basic constitutional right is for
 
03:23:12.650 --> 03:23:12.660 align:start position:0%
some people too much but it's
 
03:23:14.090 --> 03:23:14.100 align:start position:0%
you know it's twice as much as the
 
03:23:16.610 --> 03:23:16.620 align:start position:0%
in-state tuition I'm not necessarily
 
03:23:19.849 --> 03:23:19.859 align:start position:0%
there's good reasons for that and um UNH
 
03:23:21.290 --> 03:23:21.300 align:start position:0%
and the other state schools they offer
 
03:23:22.910 --> 03:23:22.920 align:start position:0%
some very excellent programs it's not
 
03:23:25.010 --> 03:23:25.020 align:start position:0%
necessarily uh
 
03:23:26.990 --> 03:23:27.000 align:start position:0%
it's not necessarily a bad deal for the
 
03:23:28.910 --> 03:23:28.920 align:start position:0%
out-of-stage students but they are you
 
03:23:30.229 --> 03:23:30.239 align:start position:0%
know getting over steel then the
 
03:23:32.269 --> 03:23:32.279 align:start position:0%
in-state students so uh
 
03:23:34.910 --> 03:23:34.920 align:start position:0%
if by anything if anything maybe
 
03:23:37.250 --> 03:23:37.260 align:start position:0%
we should have the uh
 
03:23:38.570 --> 03:23:38.580 align:start position:0%
maybe we should restricted the
 
03:23:39.650 --> 03:23:39.660 align:start position:0%
out-of-state students because they're
 
03:23:42.889 --> 03:23:42.899 align:start position:0%
paying like twice as much in in in uh
 
03:23:46.250 --> 03:23:46.260 align:start position:0%
tuition than the in-state students so
 
03:23:49.370 --> 03:23:49.380 align:start position:0%
yeah so anyway so this this is a uh
 
03:23:51.590 --> 03:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
this bill is a bad idea it's also
 
03:23:53.870 --> 03:23:53.880 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional those are two good and
 
03:23:56.809 --> 03:23:56.819 align:start position:0%
um those are two good reasons itl that I
 
03:23:59.269 --> 03:23:59.279 align:start position:0%
know the prime sponsor
 
03:24:02.210 --> 03:24:02.220 align:start position:0%
notice some drafting errors
 
03:24:04.729 --> 03:24:04.739 align:start position:0%
but I I think the basic idea in my
 
03:24:06.590 --> 03:24:06.600 align:start position:0%
opinion it's such a bad idea I don't
 
03:24:08.030 --> 03:24:08.040 align:start position:0%
think you can fix it so the best thing
 
03:24:10.790 --> 03:24:10.800 align:start position:0%
that best thing to do is is uh is
 
03:24:13.370 --> 03:24:13.380 align:start position:0%
finding any expedient to legislate and
 
03:24:15.769 --> 03:24:15.779 align:start position:0%
um I'm sure we'll see
 
03:24:17.210 --> 03:24:17.220 align:start position:0%
and we'll probably see similar
 
03:24:18.889 --> 03:24:18.899 align:start position:0%
legislation in the future but this one
 
03:24:21.170 --> 03:24:21.180 align:start position:0%
this one I think is fatally flawed so I
 
03:24:22.250 --> 03:24:22.260 align:start position:0%
don't think I don't think it's worth
 
03:24:23.630 --> 03:24:23.640 align:start position:0%
your time to fix it you've got a lot of
 
03:24:26.750 --> 03:24:26.760 align:start position:0%
other legislation to work on so
 
03:24:28.729 --> 03:24:28.739 align:start position:0%
um I guess I'm kind of leaning against a
 
03:24:31.010 --> 03:24:31.020 align:start position:0%
build as you probably discovered so if
 
03:24:32.990 --> 03:24:33.000 align:start position:0%
anybody wants to ask answer ask me any
 
03:24:35.349 --> 03:24:35.359 align:start position:0%
questions I'll try to answer
 
03:24:37.849 --> 03:24:37.859 align:start position:0%
is there any questions representative
 
03:24:41.630 --> 03:24:41.640 align:start position:0%
Moorhead thank you um I I wanted to
 
03:24:44.269 --> 03:24:44.279 align:start position:0%
address the uh and ask you about the the
 
03:24:46.309 --> 03:24:46.319 align:start position:0%
possibility that Dartmouth College might
 
03:24:48.830 --> 03:24:48.840 align:start position:0%
might spill over into the
 
03:24:51.410 --> 03:24:51.420 align:start position:0%
state of the the neighboring state that
 
03:24:52.910 --> 03:24:52.920 align:start position:0%
would go unnamed to the west of the
 
03:24:54.229 --> 03:24:54.239 align:start position:0%
Connecticut River
 
03:24:55.790 --> 03:24:55.800 align:start position:0%
um it may own some land over there but
 
03:24:57.530 --> 03:24:57.540 align:start position:0%
but there are no dormitories no no
 
03:24:59.750 --> 03:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth students live okay over there
 
03:25:02.030 --> 03:25:02.040 align:start position:0%
and I just wonder if you would join me
 
03:25:06.110 --> 03:25:06.120 align:start position:0%
uh in opposing a a movement that I've in
 
03:25:08.570 --> 03:25:08.580 align:start position:0%
underground movement rumored to be led
 
03:25:10.849 --> 03:25:10.859 align:start position:0%
by an esteemed representative from New
 
03:25:13.490 --> 03:25:13.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's Queen City to gift Hanover
 
03:25:15.650 --> 03:25:15.660 align:start position:0%
to the state of Vermont and if if that
 
03:25:17.210 --> 03:25:17.220 align:start position:0%
movement gains any momentum I hope
 
03:25:18.769 --> 03:25:18.779 align:start position:0%
you'll help me I would support the post
 
03:25:22.969 --> 03:25:22.979 align:start position:0%
oh I mean no I I no I would oppose it I
 
03:25:25.190 --> 03:25:25.200 align:start position:0%
would support your position
 
03:25:27.889 --> 03:25:27.899 align:start position:0%
Hanover west by the way the first
 
03:25:30.410 --> 03:25:30.420 align:start position:0%
capital of the Republic of Vermont which
 
03:25:32.090 --> 03:25:32.100 align:start position:0%
included a large portion of what's now
 
03:25:34.210 --> 03:25:34.220 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so uh
 
03:25:37.670 --> 03:25:37.680 align:start position:0%
we should keep Hanover uh Hanover uh in
 
03:25:38.809 --> 03:25:38.819 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we don't want to give it
 
03:25:40.370 --> 03:25:40.380 align:start position:0%
back to Vermont just one of our finest
 
03:25:42.530 --> 03:25:42.540 align:start position:0%
communities and can we stay with the
 
03:25:44.450 --> 03:25:44.460 align:start position:0%
bill please there are there are quite a
 
03:25:46.969 --> 03:25:46.979 align:start position:0%
few students yeah
 
03:25:49.070 --> 03:25:49.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you
 
03:25:51.950 --> 03:25:51.960 align:start position:0%
representative Horgan for your testimony
 
03:25:51.960 --> 03:25:53.090 align:start position:0%
representative Horgan for your testimony
today

03:25:53.090 --> 03:25:53.100 align:start position:0%
today
 
03:25:58.610 --> 03:25:58.620 align:start position:0%
um so does enrollment or attendance at a
 
03:26:00.229 --> 03:26:00.239 align:start position:0%
school established
 
03:26:03.290 --> 03:26:03.300 align:start position:0%
the domicile or the residents
 
03:26:03.300 --> 03:26:04.610 align:start position:0%
the domicile or the residents
it's

03:26:04.610 --> 03:26:04.620 align:start position:0%
it's
 
03:26:06.710 --> 03:26:06.720 align:start position:0%
it's uh more what I was talking about is
 
03:26:08.510 --> 03:26:08.520 align:start position:0%
more like where you're living while
 
03:26:10.910 --> 03:26:10.920 align:start position:0%
attending classes because uh well we're
 
03:26:12.050 --> 03:26:12.060 align:start position:0%
talking about Dartmouth for example
 
03:26:14.150 --> 03:26:14.160 align:start position:0%
there's a number of Dartmouth students
 
03:26:16.550 --> 03:26:16.560 align:start position:0%
who rent apartments and uh especially in
 
03:26:18.530 --> 03:26:18.540 align:start position:0%
Norwich or White River Junction
 
03:26:18.540 --> 03:26:19.429 align:start position:0%
Norwich or White River Junction
um

03:26:19.429 --> 03:26:19.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:26:21.590 --> 03:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
they would even though they're attending
 
03:26:23.389 --> 03:26:23.399 align:start position:0%
classes in Vermont even though there are
 
03:26:25.010 --> 03:26:25.020 align:start position:0%
a couple of classroom buildings in
 
03:26:26.929 --> 03:26:26.939 align:start position:0%
Norwich they're going to school in New
 
03:26:28.729 --> 03:26:28.739 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so they
 
03:26:30.530 --> 03:26:30.540 align:start position:0%
for that purpose it would be residents
 
03:26:33.530 --> 03:26:33.540 align:start position:0%
of Vermont but they so that but that's
 
03:26:35.630 --> 03:26:35.640 align:start position:0%
aren't as many cases the other way but
 
03:26:38.570 --> 03:26:38.580 align:start position:0%
uh they're probably a few edge cases of
 
03:26:40.070 --> 03:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
people commuting
 
03:26:40.080 --> 03:26:41.389 align:start position:0%
people commuting
moving

03:26:41.389 --> 03:26:41.399 align:start position:0%
moving
 
03:26:43.010 --> 03:26:43.020 align:start position:0%
moving from somewhere else to New
 
03:26:44.870 --> 03:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and then commuting across the
 
03:26:46.670 --> 03:26:46.680 align:start position:0%
community across the state line to
 
03:26:48.050 --> 03:26:48.060 align:start position:0%
another state and of course you also
 
03:26:49.370 --> 03:26:49.380 align:start position:0%
have students who are in low residency
 
03:26:52.610 --> 03:26:52.620 align:start position:0%
programs or online programs too so it's
 
03:26:54.530 --> 03:26:54.540 align:start position:0%
at least in my view what I have in mind
 
03:26:56.510 --> 03:26:56.520 align:start position:0%
is where you're where you're living
 
03:26:58.729 --> 03:26:58.739 align:start position:0%
where you're spending uh spending your
 
03:27:01.309 --> 03:27:01.319 align:start position:0%
time while you're going through while
 
03:27:02.809 --> 03:27:02.819 align:start position:0%
you're attending the educational
 
03:27:02.819 --> 03:27:05.090 align:start position:0%
you're attending the educational
Institution

03:27:05.090 --> 03:27:05.100 align:start position:0%
Institution
 
03:27:06.950 --> 03:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
okay so I don't know if that answers it
 
03:27:10.490 --> 03:27:10.500 align:start position:0%
or not but thank you thank you
 
03:27:12.290 --> 03:27:12.300 align:start position:0%
any more questions
 
03:27:16.070 --> 03:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:17.990 --> 03:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
I now call
 
03:27:21.769 --> 03:27:21.779 align:start position:0%
Mr Tom Cronin
 
03:27:41.809 --> 03:27:41.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:43.490 --> 03:27:43.500 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chairman members of
 
03:27:45.710 --> 03:27:45.720 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is Tom Cronin uh
 
03:27:47.210 --> 03:27:47.220 align:start position:0%
and I am the director of government
 
03:27:49.490 --> 03:27:49.500 align:start position:0%
relations for the University system uh
 
03:27:51.229 --> 03:27:51.239 align:start position:0%
we're here today in opposition to House
 
03:27:53.990 --> 03:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
Bill 405 uh in our opinion because it
 
03:27:56.389 --> 03:27:56.399 align:start position:0%
impractically puts our institutions in
 
03:27:58.010 --> 03:27:58.020 align:start position:0%
between our students and their right to
 
03:28:00.950 --> 03:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
vote uh we essentially have two main
 
03:28:03.769 --> 03:28:03.779 align:start position:0%
concerns with the bill first is it's
 
03:28:05.690 --> 03:28:05.700 align:start position:0%
attempting to link a student's right to
 
03:28:11.210 --> 03:28:11.220 align:start position:0%
vote under RSA 651 uh colon 1 1A with
 
03:28:12.830 --> 03:28:12.840 align:start position:0%
resident tuition
 
03:28:15.170 --> 03:28:15.180 align:start position:0%
under current law state statute gives
 
03:28:16.790 --> 03:28:16.800 align:start position:0%
our Board of Trustees the authority to
 
03:28:19.010 --> 03:28:19.020 align:start position:0%
set resident tuition rates for uh
 
03:28:20.330 --> 03:28:20.340 align:start position:0%
in-state and out-of-state students
 
03:28:22.429 --> 03:28:22.439 align:start position:0%
essentially right now the out-of-state
 
03:28:24.410 --> 03:28:24.420 align:start position:0%
tuition rate is a function of two main
 
03:28:26.570 --> 03:28:26.580 align:start position:0%
components first you have to prove that
 
03:28:28.370 --> 03:28:28.380 align:start position:0%
you've lived in the state for a year or
 
03:28:30.349 --> 03:28:30.359 align:start position:0%
longer and second you have to prove that
 
03:28:31.969 --> 03:28:31.979 align:start position:0%
you have lived in the state for some
 
03:28:33.830 --> 03:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
purpose other than education so
 
03:28:35.630 --> 03:28:35.640 align:start position:0%
essentially you couldn't come back as a
 
03:28:37.490 --> 03:28:37.500 align:start position:0%
junior for example and say I've lived
 
03:28:39.530 --> 03:28:39.540 align:start position:0%
here for two years because your main
 
03:28:41.510 --> 03:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
purpose is education you'd have to show
 
03:28:43.070 --> 03:28:43.080 align:start position:0%
some other connection to the state in
 
03:28:44.349 --> 03:28:44.359 align:start position:0%
order to
 
03:28:47.389 --> 03:28:47.399 align:start position:0%
gain access to in-state tuition rates
 
03:28:49.309 --> 03:28:49.319 align:start position:0%
the issue here becomes by linking the
 
03:28:50.870 --> 03:28:50.880 align:start position:0%
two of those together the bill
 
03:28:53.389 --> 03:28:53.399 align:start position:0%
essentially creates a one-year plus
 
03:28:55.490 --> 03:28:55.500 align:start position:0%
residency requirement for college
 
03:28:57.349 --> 03:28:57.359 align:start position:0%
students that doesn't exist for anybody
 
03:28:58.790 --> 03:28:58.800 align:start position:0%
else in the state of New Hampshire when
 
03:29:00.170 --> 03:29:00.180 align:start position:0%
it comes to vote as this committee well
 
03:29:02.030 --> 03:29:02.040 align:start position:0%
knows the state does not have a
 
03:29:04.849 --> 03:29:04.859 align:start position:0%
residency requirement so by linking
 
03:29:06.950 --> 03:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
in-state tuition which requires at least
 
03:29:08.929 --> 03:29:08.939 align:start position:0%
one year of residency with your right to
 
03:29:11.030 --> 03:29:11.040 align:start position:0%
vote you've created that for one class
 
03:29:13.790 --> 03:29:13.800 align:start position:0%
of Citizen uh I'd also second comments
 
03:29:16.010 --> 03:29:16.020 align:start position:0%
have been made so far the private
 
03:29:18.590 --> 03:29:18.600 align:start position:0%
institutions in our state do not have
 
03:29:20.150 --> 03:29:20.160 align:start position:0%
in-state tuition rates so students would
 
03:29:21.710 --> 03:29:21.720 align:start position:0%
not have a way to show in-state tuition
 
03:29:23.750 --> 03:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
while registering to vote so essentially
 
03:29:25.910 --> 03:29:25.920 align:start position:0%
this creates a second class of Citizen
 
03:29:28.210 --> 03:29:28.220 align:start position:0%
only for students at the public
 
03:29:30.950 --> 03:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
universities and colleges
 
03:29:33.290 --> 03:29:33.300 align:start position:0%
our second concern uh deals with parts
 
03:29:34.849 --> 03:29:34.859 align:start position:0%
essentially two and three of the bill
 
03:29:37.070 --> 03:29:37.080 align:start position:0%
two for us three for our colleagues at
 
03:29:39.170 --> 03:29:39.180 align:start position:0%
the community college system uh whereby
 
03:29:40.969 --> 03:29:40.979 align:start position:0%
the university system will be required
 
03:29:43.010 --> 03:29:43.020 align:start position:0%
to provide a list of eligible in-state
 
03:29:44.870 --> 03:29:44.880 align:start position:0%
voters to the Secretary of State the way
 
03:29:46.550 --> 03:29:46.560 align:start position:0%
this is written really we have two
 
03:29:48.889 --> 03:29:48.899 align:start position:0%
questions uh because it's tacked on to
 
03:29:51.050 --> 03:29:51.060 align:start position:0%
the section on identification cards it's
 
03:29:52.969 --> 03:29:52.979 align:start position:0%
unclear to us if we would actually be
 
03:29:54.650 --> 03:29:54.660 align:start position:0%
required to provide a list of eligible
 
03:29:57.469 --> 03:29:57.479 align:start position:0%
in-state voters for every student in the
 
03:29:59.210 --> 03:29:59.220 align:start position:0%
state which is what the requirement for
 
03:30:01.130 --> 03:30:01.140 align:start position:0%
identification cards is or would just be
 
03:30:03.349 --> 03:30:03.359 align:start position:0%
required for our students uh and second
 
03:30:05.510 --> 03:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
the university system quite frankly is
 
03:30:07.429 --> 03:30:07.439 align:start position:0%
not the organization in the state that
 
03:30:09.530 --> 03:30:09.540 align:start position:0%
deals with voter eligibility that is the
 
03:30:11.809 --> 03:30:11.819 align:start position:0%
town clerks the secretary of state folks
 
03:30:14.090 --> 03:30:14.100 align:start position:0%
you all know far better we can tell you
 
03:30:16.250 --> 03:30:16.260 align:start position:0%
uh pieces of it but we are not going to
 
03:30:18.229 --> 03:30:18.239 align:start position:0%
judge are you a citizen uh or does your
 
03:30:19.790 --> 03:30:19.800 align:start position:0%
age all these other pieces that is for
 
03:30:22.130 --> 03:30:22.140 align:start position:0%
others to decide as part of this process
 
03:30:23.990 --> 03:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
so with that I think I'd be happy to
 
03:30:26.269 --> 03:30:26.279 align:start position:0%
take any questions
 
03:30:29.210 --> 03:30:29.220 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions yes Mr
 
03:30:31.550 --> 03:30:31.560 align:start position:0%
representative Howard thank you Mr chair
 
03:30:33.530 --> 03:30:33.540 align:start position:0%
and uh thank you uh Mr Cronin for coming
 
03:30:36.889 --> 03:30:36.899 align:start position:0%
today uh so when determining in-state
 
03:30:38.870 --> 03:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
tuition uh what factors are taken into
 
03:30:38.880 --> 03:30:39.889 align:start position:0%
tuition uh what factors are taken into
account

03:30:39.889 --> 03:30:39.899 align:start position:0%
account
 
03:30:42.349 --> 03:30:42.359 align:start position:0%
again the two main ones and uh actually
 
03:30:43.729 --> 03:30:43.739 align:start position:0%
I think the representative the sponsor
 
03:30:46.510 --> 03:30:46.520 align:start position:0%
uh was actually into uh the board
 
03:30:48.710 --> 03:30:48.720 align:start position:0%
guidelines on this but again the two
 
03:30:50.090 --> 03:30:50.100 align:start position:0%
main things is in order to be eligible
 
03:30:51.769 --> 03:30:51.779 align:start position:0%
for in-state tuition you have to prove
 
03:30:52.910 --> 03:30:52.920 align:start position:0%
you've lived here for at least a year
 
03:30:54.410 --> 03:30:54.420 align:start position:0%
and you have to prove you've been here
 
03:30:56.510 --> 03:30:56.520 align:start position:0%
for purposes other than education so you
 
03:30:58.370 --> 03:30:58.380 align:start position:0%
can't just move into the state and say I
 
03:30:59.750 --> 03:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
would like in-state tuition after having
 
03:31:01.070 --> 03:31:01.080 align:start position:0%
essentially attended one of our
 
03:31:02.929 --> 03:31:02.939 align:start position:0%
institutions for a year you have to have
 
03:31:04.250 --> 03:31:04.260 align:start position:0%
been here for a year and you have to
 
03:31:05.630 --> 03:31:05.640 align:start position:0%
have shown you are here for some purpose
 
03:31:07.309 --> 03:31:07.319 align:start position:0%
other than education so again that's our
 
03:31:08.870 --> 03:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
concern by saying you have to show
 
03:31:10.250 --> 03:31:10.260 align:start position:0%
you've been here for a year in order to
 
03:31:12.170 --> 03:31:12.180 align:start position:0%
access in-state tuition you've created
 
03:31:15.229 --> 03:31:15.239 align:start position:0%
this uh essentially one-year residency
 
03:31:16.790 --> 03:31:16.800 align:start position:0%
requirement that doesn't exist for
 
03:31:18.349 --> 03:31:18.359 align:start position:0%
anybody else seeking to register to vote
 
03:31:22.130 --> 03:31:22.140 align:start position:0%
in the state uh follow up
 
03:31:24.469 --> 03:31:24.479 align:start position:0%
yeah I I might not have necessarily been
 
03:31:28.550 --> 03:31:28.560 align:start position:0%
as specific but uh do uh essentially uh
 
03:31:30.650 --> 03:31:30.660 align:start position:0%
are our parents the ones determining
 
03:31:33.170 --> 03:31:33.180 align:start position:0%
residency of the individual student uh
 
03:31:35.030 --> 03:31:35.040 align:start position:0%
before they attend the University yeah
 
03:31:36.769 --> 03:31:36.779 align:start position:0%
they certainly I mean certainly a
 
03:31:39.469 --> 03:31:39.479 align:start position:0%
parent's uh place of residence does play
 
03:31:40.990 --> 03:31:41.000 align:start position:0%
into it particularly for un
 
03:31:47.090 --> 03:31:47.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:48.950 --> 03:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
um yeah I have a question about
 
03:31:50.870 --> 03:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
yeah this in general
 
03:31:50.880 --> 03:31:52.370 align:start position:0%
yeah this in general
um

03:31:52.370 --> 03:31:52.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:31:54.590 --> 03:31:54.600 align:start position:0%
they're voting here they're registering
 
03:31:55.610 --> 03:31:55.620 align:start position:0%
to vote here they're establishing
 
03:31:57.469 --> 03:31:57.479 align:start position:0%
domicile here why aren't we giving them
 
03:31:58.790 --> 03:31:58.800 align:start position:0%
in-state tuition they're saying they're
 
03:31:59.990 --> 03:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
going to stay here for an indefinite
 
03:32:01.070 --> 03:32:01.080 align:start position:0%
period of time
 
03:32:03.110 --> 03:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
are we not are we discriminating against
 
03:32:05.809 --> 03:32:05.819 align:start position:0%
these um young adults for not giving
 
03:32:07.550 --> 03:32:07.560 align:start position:0%
them in-state tuition like shouldn't
 
03:32:08.630 --> 03:32:08.640 align:start position:0%
they get it when they register vote
 
03:32:09.650 --> 03:32:09.660 align:start position:0%
they're saying they want to be a part of
 
03:32:11.510 --> 03:32:11.520 align:start position:0%
the state so why we continue to say no
 
03:32:12.710 --> 03:32:12.720 align:start position:0%
you're an outsider we're going to charge
 
03:32:14.389 --> 03:32:14.399 align:start position:0%
you more even though you're voting on
 
03:32:15.889 --> 03:32:15.899 align:start position:0%
our elections sure again the board of
 
03:32:17.990 --> 03:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
the state RSA gives our Board of
 
03:32:19.729 --> 03:32:19.739 align:start position:0%
Trustees authority to determine in-state
 
03:32:21.290 --> 03:32:21.300 align:start position:0%
and out-of-state tuition currently that
 
03:32:23.030 --> 03:32:23.040 align:start position:0%
is determined really by two factors have
 
03:32:24.710 --> 03:32:24.720 align:start position:0%
you been here for at least a year uh and
 
03:32:25.910 --> 03:32:25.920 align:start position:0%
are you here for some purpose other than
 
03:32:29.809 --> 03:32:29.819 align:start position:0%
education follow-up so so what so the
 
03:32:31.610 --> 03:32:31.620 align:start position:0%
the boards in their conversations why
 
03:32:32.990 --> 03:32:33.000 align:start position:0%
did they set it there why didn't they
 
03:32:34.790 --> 03:32:34.800 align:start position:0%
did they take this into consideration of
 
03:32:36.590 --> 03:32:36.600 align:start position:0%
this person's voting here so they now
 
03:32:39.469 --> 03:32:39.479 align:start position:0%
live here you know this person is voting
 
03:32:41.150 --> 03:32:41.160 align:start position:0%
here they have a New Hampshire driver's
 
03:32:44.510 --> 03:32:44.520 align:start position:0%
license if they are um they registered
 
03:32:47.090 --> 03:32:47.100 align:start position:0%
their car here they're according to our
 
03:32:48.710 --> 03:32:48.720 align:start position:0%
voting laws they're staying here for an
 
03:32:51.349 --> 03:32:51.359 align:start position:0%
indefinite period of time why did the
 
03:32:52.910 --> 03:32:52.920 align:start position:0%
board take into consideration why are we
 
03:32:54.349 --> 03:32:54.359 align:start position:0%
not giving them in-state tuition and
 
03:32:56.389 --> 03:32:56.399 align:start position:0%
does that do we need to to mandate that
 
03:32:58.910 --> 03:32:58.920 align:start position:0%
sure so again uh our board has been
 
03:33:00.229 --> 03:33:00.239 align:start position:0%
given the authority to determine how
 
03:33:02.090 --> 03:33:02.100 align:start position:0%
they uh how we set in-state tuition
 
03:33:03.950 --> 03:33:03.960 align:start position:0%
rules lived here for a year some purpose
 
03:33:05.450 --> 03:33:05.460 align:start position:0%
other than education and I'll say you
 
03:33:06.469 --> 03:33:06.479 align:start position:0%
know we certainly have students who
 
03:33:08.450 --> 03:33:08.460 align:start position:0%
approach us on an occasional basis to
 
03:33:09.950 --> 03:33:09.960 align:start position:0%
say that I've been living in New
 
03:33:11.510 --> 03:33:11.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I you know I moved here from
 
03:33:13.190 --> 03:33:13.200 align:start position:0%
somewhere else uh you know I live in an
 
03:33:15.110 --> 03:33:15.120 align:start position:0%
apartment off campus in Durham I live
 
03:33:16.309 --> 03:33:16.319 align:start position:0%
here now I should be eligible for
 
03:33:18.530 --> 03:33:18.540 align:start position:0%
in-state tuition but again we have rules
 
03:33:20.450 --> 03:33:20.460 align:start position:0%
in place that say you need to prove one
 
03:33:22.370 --> 03:33:22.380 align:start position:0%
year plus have income for some other
 
03:33:22.380 --> 03:33:25.250 align:start position:0%
year plus have income for some other
purpose

03:33:25.250 --> 03:33:25.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:28.790 --> 03:33:28.800 align:start position:0%
representative Howard thank you uh thank
 
03:33:32.269 --> 03:33:32.279 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair uh and I guess what would
 
03:33:34.610 --> 03:33:34.620 align:start position:0%
the financial impact be of those
 
03:33:36.349 --> 03:33:36.359 align:start position:0%
students receiving in-state tuition
 
03:33:37.610 --> 03:33:37.620 align:start position:0%
instead of paying out of state yeah and
 
03:33:39.170 --> 03:33:39.180 align:start position:0%
we've had legislation proposed to do
 
03:33:40.490 --> 03:33:40.500 align:start position:0%
exactly what representative Berry has
 
03:33:42.170 --> 03:33:42.180 align:start position:0%
suggested I think in past years to
 
03:33:44.990 --> 03:33:45.000 align:start position:0%
essentially say to to link it the other
 
03:33:47.330 --> 03:33:47.340 align:start position:0%
way right so this this attempt is to say
 
03:33:49.370 --> 03:33:49.380 align:start position:0%
uh you have to show in-state rates in
 
03:33:51.590 --> 03:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
order to register the other one was you
 
03:33:53.150 --> 03:33:53.160 align:start position:0%
could show your voter registration as an
 
03:33:55.010 --> 03:33:55.020 align:start position:0%
in-state requirement we obviously oppose
 
03:33:57.170 --> 03:33:57.180 align:start position:0%
that as it would be hundreds of millions
 
03:33:59.450 --> 03:33:59.460 align:start position:0%
of dollars okay thank you
 
03:34:01.969 --> 03:34:01.979 align:start position:0%
and representative Homer Bryant thank
 
03:34:04.010 --> 03:34:04.020 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman
 
03:34:08.630 --> 03:34:08.640 align:start position:0%
are there any other exceptions made that
 
03:34:11.030 --> 03:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
students would receive in-state tuition
 
03:34:13.429 --> 03:34:13.439 align:start position:0%
other than the year
 
03:34:16.490 --> 03:34:16.500 align:start position:0%
uh residency requirement and the
 
03:34:18.050 --> 03:34:18.060 align:start position:0%
requirement that they be here for
 
03:34:20.690 --> 03:34:20.700 align:start position:0%
another purpose is there any other
 
03:34:22.790 --> 03:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
exception to that any other student that
 
03:34:24.290 --> 03:34:24.300 align:start position:0%
gets in-state tuition
 
03:34:26.630 --> 03:34:26.640 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to say there that I that
 
03:34:28.309 --> 03:34:28.319 align:start position:0%
there isn't I couldn't go find you a
 
03:34:31.190 --> 03:34:31.200 align:start position:0%
case I will say those are the two pieces
 
03:34:32.750 --> 03:34:32.760 align:start position:0%
that you really need to you need to
 
03:34:34.490 --> 03:34:34.500 align:start position:0%
clear that hurdle before your granted
 
03:34:35.630 --> 03:34:35.640 align:start position:0%
in-state tuition
 
03:34:37.130 --> 03:34:37.140 align:start position:0%
there are a number of other pieces that
 
03:34:38.630 --> 03:34:38.640 align:start position:0%
go into that calculation but if you
 
03:34:41.269 --> 03:34:41.279 align:start position:0%
can't show Beyond those two then that's
 
03:34:45.170 --> 03:34:45.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:45.180 --> 03:34:46.729 align:start position:0%
 
representative

03:34:46.729 --> 03:34:46.739 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:34:49.429 --> 03:34:49.439 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh thank you for your
 
03:34:51.769 --> 03:34:51.779 align:start position:0%
testimony uh do the schools you
 
03:34:53.990 --> 03:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
represent are they land grant schools uh
 
03:34:55.070 --> 03:34:55.080 align:start position:0%
the University of New Hampshire is the
 
03:34:56.630 --> 03:34:56.640 align:start position:0%
land grant and then Keene State and
 
03:34:58.610 --> 03:34:58.620 align:start position:0%
Plymouth state are the other two
 
03:35:00.170 --> 03:35:00.180 align:start position:0%
components of the University system so
 
03:35:03.590 --> 03:35:03.600 align:start position:0%
land grant as I understand it land-grant
 
03:35:06.349 --> 03:35:06.359 align:start position:0%
schools will grant out-of-state students
 
03:35:08.450 --> 03:35:08.460 align:start position:0%
in-state tuition if those programs are
 
03:35:11.030 --> 03:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
not offered in their home state as part
 
03:35:13.070 --> 03:35:13.080 align:start position:0%
of the compact yes
 
03:35:15.530 --> 03:35:15.540 align:start position:0%
good example yeah so I'm not sure though
 
03:35:17.090 --> 03:35:17.100 align:start position:0%
how many of those
 
03:35:19.309 --> 03:35:19.319 align:start position:0%
I would I would need to go get some
 
03:35:20.510 --> 03:35:20.520 align:start position:0%
information for you to how many of those
 
03:35:22.670 --> 03:35:22.680 align:start position:0%
we actually have but
 
03:35:24.769 --> 03:35:24.779 align:start position:0%
any any any organization that's part of
 
03:35:26.750 --> 03:35:26.760 align:start position:0%
right those compact programs will offer
 
03:35:29.030 --> 03:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
those collaborative rights for sure
 
03:35:32.030 --> 03:35:32.040 align:start position:0%
right I can I can do a little bit on
 
03:35:33.950 --> 03:35:33.960 align:start position:0%
that at the former member of the New
 
03:35:36.170 --> 03:35:36.180 align:start position:0%
England Board of higher education that's
 
03:35:38.690 --> 03:35:38.700 align:start position:0%
one of the things we do it's in the it's
 
03:35:41.030 --> 03:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
in our budget that we give x amount of
 
03:35:42.830 --> 03:35:42.840 align:start position:0%
money to the name of the board of higher
 
03:35:45.650 --> 03:35:45.660 align:start position:0%
education and they determine
 
03:35:48.050 --> 03:35:48.060 align:start position:0%
in different universities or colleges
 
03:35:51.050 --> 03:35:51.060 align:start position:0%
across New England for example New
 
03:35:52.490 --> 03:35:52.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire does not have a dental school
 
03:35:55.309 --> 03:35:55.319 align:start position:0%
Maine does and so those are the
 
03:35:57.290 --> 03:35:57.300 align:start position:0%
agreements that have worked out between
 
03:35:58.849 --> 03:35:58.859 align:start position:0%
the states with the New England Board of
 
03:35:58.859 --> 03:35:59.990 align:start position:0%
the states with the New England Board of
Hyatt

03:35:59.990 --> 03:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
Hyatt
 
03:36:02.030 --> 03:36:02.040 align:start position:0%

thank you for allowing me to speak today
 
03:36:32.990 --> 03:36:33.000 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman
 
03:36:35.210 --> 03:36:35.220 align:start position:0%
and thank you to committee members for
 
03:36:38.570 --> 03:36:38.580 align:start position:0%
allowing me to hear my testimony
 
03:36:40.010 --> 03:36:40.020 align:start position:0%
first of all I want to say that I'm in
 
03:36:41.990 --> 03:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
support of all students
 
03:36:45.229 --> 03:36:45.239 align:start position:0%
um and uh all students voices
 
03:36:48.050 --> 03:36:48.060 align:start position:0%
um but I am here to testify in favor of
 
03:36:50.090 --> 03:36:50.100 align:start position:0%
this bill and I do believe that students
 
03:36:51.650 --> 03:36:51.660 align:start position:0%
should not be allowed a dual State
 
03:36:53.510 --> 03:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
citizenship status
 
03:36:55.370 --> 03:36:55.380 align:start position:0%
wherever their parents May reside or
 
03:36:57.170 --> 03:36:57.180 align:start position:0%
where they they may reside should be one
 
03:36:57.180 --> 03:36:58.370 align:start position:0%
where they they may reside should be one
location

03:36:58.370 --> 03:36:58.380 align:start position:0%
location
 
03:37:00.229 --> 03:37:00.239 align:start position:0%
our votes are so precious to America
 
03:37:03.229 --> 03:37:03.239 align:start position:0%
that our government placed it under the
 
03:37:05.450 --> 03:37:05.460 align:start position:0%
security of the dod then further the
 
03:37:07.790 --> 03:37:07.800 align:start position:0%
under the homeland security why would we
 
03:37:09.650 --> 03:37:09.660 align:start position:0%
not protect every single vote in the
 
03:37:11.450 --> 03:37:11.460 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire with the same
 
03:37:13.670 --> 03:37:13.680 align:start position:0%
precautions and vettings we do as a
 
03:37:15.290 --> 03:37:15.300 align:start position:0%
driver's license for State of New
 
03:37:16.729 --> 03:37:16.739 align:start position:0%
Hampshire DMV
 
03:37:18.590 --> 03:37:18.600 align:start position:0%
if a student must pay out of state
 
03:37:20.690 --> 03:37:20.700 align:start position:0%
tuition to benefit from the New
 
03:37:22.929 --> 03:37:22.939 align:start position:0%
Hampshire lawful citizen state tax
 
03:37:26.210 --> 03:37:26.220 align:start position:0%
contributions as for their Institution
 
03:37:28.610 --> 03:37:28.620 align:start position:0%
than the same qualification should apply
 
03:37:30.830 --> 03:37:30.840 align:start position:0%
to their ability to vote on the outcomes
 
03:37:32.330 --> 03:37:32.340 align:start position:0%
for our elections
 
03:37:34.550 --> 03:37:34.560 align:start position:0%
our founding fathers had three boxes
 
03:37:37.490 --> 03:37:37.500 align:start position:0%
when we when creating our country first
 
03:37:39.830 --> 03:37:39.840 align:start position:0%
was the soapbox which allows us our
 
03:37:41.630 --> 03:37:41.640 align:start position:0%
right to Rally using our inalienable
 
03:37:44.030 --> 03:37:44.040 align:start position:0%
rights such as freedom of speech to be
 
03:37:46.010 --> 03:37:46.020 align:start position:0%
heard today and I support that for our
 
03:37:47.330 --> 03:37:47.340 align:start position:0%
students as well
 
03:37:49.729 --> 03:37:49.739 align:start position:0%
the second is The Ballot Box our votes
 
03:37:52.370 --> 03:37:52.380 align:start position:0%
which are precious to each one of us as
 
03:37:54.469 --> 03:37:54.479 align:start position:0%
the money that we work so hard to
 
03:37:57.110 --> 03:37:57.120 align:start position:0%
diligently earn and trustingly place
 
03:37:59.690 --> 03:37:59.700 align:start position:0%
into bank vaults as we do our votes at
 
03:38:02.030 --> 03:38:02.040 align:start position:0%
the polls investing into our futures
 
03:38:03.889 --> 03:38:03.899 align:start position:0%
this is the topic that we're here to
 
03:38:06.889 --> 03:38:06.899 align:start position:0%
discuss today the third is the ammo box
 
03:38:09.830 --> 03:38:09.840 align:start position:0%
as a result of the sacrifice and all the
 
03:38:12.830 --> 03:38:12.840 align:start position:0%
battles won beginning here in Portsmouth
 
03:38:16.309 --> 03:38:16.319 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire in 1775. thankfully today
 
03:38:18.410 --> 03:38:18.420 align:start position:0%
we don't need that box because of a
 
03:38:20.990 --> 03:38:21.000 align:start position:0%
brilliant and brave statesman's
 
03:38:23.450 --> 03:38:23.460 align:start position:0%
who made clear their intentions for this
 
03:38:25.969 --> 03:38:25.979 align:start position:0%
country assembled in the American Bill
 
03:38:27.830 --> 03:38:27.840 align:start position:0%
of Rights white papers their body of
 
03:38:29.990 --> 03:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
work and consideration that went into
 
03:38:32.450 --> 03:38:32.460 align:start position:0%
drafting are an incredible Constitution
 
03:38:35.630 --> 03:38:35.640 align:start position:0%
to ensure that we would have protection
 
03:38:38.210 --> 03:38:38.220 align:start position:0%
over these rights with a military that
 
03:38:40.969 --> 03:38:40.979 align:start position:0%
protects our sovereignty and our votes
 
03:38:42.830 --> 03:38:42.840 align:start position:0%
I am hopeful with our new Congress
 
03:38:45.410 --> 03:38:45.420 align:start position:0%
that's before us today each of you took
 
03:38:46.969 --> 03:38:46.979 align:start position:0%

03:39:51.469 --> 03:39:51.479 align:start position:0%
tuition purposes is considered to be
 
03:39:53.870 --> 03:39:53.880 align:start position:0%
that of their parent unless the student
 
03:39:56.269 --> 03:39:56.279 align:start position:0%
is emancipated so qualify for
 
03:39:58.790 --> 03:39:58.800 align:start position:0%
institution status a student or his or
 
03:40:00.590 --> 03:40:00.600 align:start position:0%
her parents if a dependent must
 
03:40:01.969 --> 03:40:01.979 align:start position:0%
physically reside in New Hampshire for
 
03:40:04.490 --> 03:40:04.500 align:start position:0%
12 months so to tie someone's voting
 
03:40:05.870 --> 03:40:05.880 align:start position:0%
rights and individuals own rights to
 
03:40:07.250 --> 03:40:07.260 align:start position:0%
their parents obviously is very
 
03:40:07.260 --> 03:40:08.570 align:start position:0%
their parents obviously is very
problematic

03:40:08.570 --> 03:40:08.580 align:start position:0%
problematic
 
03:40:10.190 --> 03:40:10.200 align:start position:0%
um newburger versus Peterson is
 
03:40:12.290 --> 03:40:12.300 align:start position:0%
referenced to the 1972 case that gave
 
03:40:14.990 --> 03:40:15.000 align:start position:0%
students the right to vote in the city
 
03:40:16.870 --> 03:40:16.880 align:start position:0%
or town in which they go to college
 
03:40:20.510 --> 03:40:20.520 align:start position:0%
and so for those two reasons alone we
 
03:40:23.990 --> 03:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill and ask you to Ideal it
 
03:40:26.210 --> 03:40:26.220 align:start position:0%
I have to take any questions
 
03:40:29.450 --> 03:40:29.460 align:start position:0%
anybody have any questions
 
03:40:31.729 --> 03:40:31.739 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:40:41.750 --> 03:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:44.450 --> 03:40:44.460 align:start position:0%
Al brandak
 
03:40:44.460 --> 03:40:52.610 align:start position:0%
Al brandak
okay

03:40:52.610 --> 03:40:52.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:54.410 --> 03:40:54.420 align:start position:0%
thank you everybody
 
03:40:56.150 --> 03:40:56.160 align:start position:0%
my name is Al brendano I'm from
 
03:40:58.490 --> 03:40:58.500 align:start position:0%
Kensington New Hampshire
 
03:40:58.500 --> 03:41:00.170 align:start position:0%
Kensington New Hampshire
um

03:41:00.170 --> 03:41:00.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:41:03.229 --> 03:41:03.239 align:start position:0%
I think it was Mark Twain once said
 
03:41:07.309 --> 03:41:07.319 align:start position:0%
the most uncommon sense is common sense
 
03:41:10.370 --> 03:41:10.380 align:start position:0%
when you I'm in favor strongly in favor
 
03:41:12.290 --> 03:41:12.300 align:start position:0%
of HB 405
 
03:41:14.990 --> 03:41:15.000 align:start position:0%
and the reason for it specifically is if
 
03:41:17.570 --> 03:41:17.580 align:start position:0%
you look back and especially recently
 
03:41:19.729 --> 03:41:19.739 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire New Hampshire is
 
03:41:22.370 --> 03:41:22.380 align:start position:0%
purple and what does that mean means
 
03:41:25.190 --> 03:41:25.200 align:start position:0%
that elections can be lost within three
 
03:41:27.530 --> 03:41:27.540 align:start position:0%
to five percent of the votes and it
 
03:41:29.450 --> 03:41:29.460 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter what party is in power
 
03:41:32.150 --> 03:41:32.160 align:start position:0%
right now or not because that can change
 
03:41:35.150 --> 03:41:35.160 align:start position:0%
in an economic situation or other
 
03:41:37.910 --> 03:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
so this is about not just voting rights
 
03:41:40.849 --> 03:41:40.859 align:start position:0%
but it's about secure elections and I
 
03:41:42.950 --> 03:41:42.960 align:start position:0%
think it's really important that we talk
 
03:41:46.250 --> 03:41:46.260 align:start position:0%
about students in this case college
 
03:41:48.889 --> 03:41:48.899 align:start position:0%
students with special privileges and let
 
03:41:50.690 --> 03:41:50.700 align:start position:0%
me explain
 
03:41:52.849 --> 03:41:52.859 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General Nicholas Kong yen
 
03:41:55.070 --> 03:41:55.080 align:start position:0%
in November 2020 New Hampshire college
 
03:41:57.290 --> 03:41:57.300 align:start position:0%
students temporarily living outside the
 
03:41:59.750 --> 03:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
state because of covid-19 pandemic can
 
03:42:01.729 --> 03:42:01.739 align:start position:0%
continue claiming Granite State as a
 
03:42:04.309 --> 03:42:04.319 align:start position:0%
domicile and are allowed to vote in
 
03:42:06.229 --> 03:42:06.239 align:start position:0%
November third election the State
 
03:42:08.050 --> 03:42:08.060 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office said Wednesday
 
03:42:10.969 --> 03:42:10.979 align:start position:0%
once a student lawfully established a
 
03:42:13.309 --> 03:42:13.319 align:start position:0%
domicile in New Hampshire the student
 
03:42:15.889 --> 03:42:15.899 align:start position:0%
does not lose his domicile due to
 
03:42:18.530 --> 03:42:18.540 align:start position:0%
Temporary absence
 
03:42:20.870 --> 03:42:20.880 align:start position:0%
I ask you how long is a temporary
 
03:42:20.880 --> 03:42:22.490 align:start position:0%
I ask you how long is a temporary
absence

03:42:22.490 --> 03:42:22.500 align:start position:0%
absence
 
03:42:25.010 --> 03:42:25.020 align:start position:0%
three months six months two years
 
03:42:26.870 --> 03:42:26.880 align:start position:0%
can you vote in New Hampshire five years
 
03:42:30.050 --> 03:42:30.060 align:start position:0%
from now I don't know but it's clearly
 
03:42:31.969 --> 03:42:31.979 align:start position:0%
it's a special privilege
 
03:42:34.550 --> 03:42:34.560 align:start position:0%
how about domicile and Resident another
 
03:42:36.349 --> 03:42:36.359 align:start position:0%
special privilege this is from the
 
03:42:38.269 --> 03:42:38.279 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's website
 
03:42:40.969 --> 03:42:40.979 align:start position:0%
and Joint guidance is provided
 
03:42:42.950 --> 03:42:42.960 align:start position:0%
by the co the consultation with the
 
03:42:45.290 --> 03:42:45.300 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office the following
 
03:42:47.090 --> 03:42:47.100 align:start position:0%
guidance on voter registration is
 
03:42:49.309 --> 03:42:49.319 align:start position:0%
provided by the Secretary of State
 
03:42:51.469 --> 03:42:51.479 align:start position:0%
the following guidance on the mode of
 
03:42:53.330 --> 03:42:53.340 align:start position:0%
vehicle law is provided by the
 
03:42:54.950 --> 03:42:54.960 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the Department of Safety
 
03:42:58.910 --> 03:42:58.920 align:start position:0%
the terms Dom missile and Resident are
 
03:42:58.920 --> 03:43:00.410 align:start position:0%
the terms Dom missile and Resident are
equivalent

03:43:00.410 --> 03:43:00.420 align:start position:0%
equivalent
 
03:43:03.050 --> 03:43:03.060 align:start position:0%
this is a problem and I'll explain later
 
03:43:05.050 --> 03:43:05.060 align:start position:0%
even though RSA
 
03:43:07.990 --> 03:43:08.000 align:start position:0%
21-6a and RSA
 
03:43:11.809 --> 03:43:11.819 align:start position:0%
65641 contain different words this is
 
03:43:14.410 --> 03:43:14.420 align:start position:0%
them this is from the Department itself
 
03:43:17.750 --> 03:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
they can convey the same basic concept
 
03:43:20.690 --> 03:43:20.700 align:start position:0%
when a person makes a toner award in New
 
03:43:23.570 --> 03:43:23.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire his or her principal place or
 
03:43:25.729 --> 03:43:25.739 align:start position:0%
physical presence to the exclusion of
 
03:43:28.190 --> 03:43:28.200 align:start position:0%
all other places that person has
 
03:43:31.429 --> 03:43:31.439 align:start position:0%
established a domicile in Residence
 
03:43:33.590 --> 03:43:33.600 align:start position:0%
think about what we're doing now for
 
03:43:35.750 --> 03:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
security of voting
 
03:43:37.490 --> 03:43:37.500 align:start position:0%
once again it doesn't matter what party
 
03:43:38.870 --> 03:43:38.880 align:start position:0%
is in place
 
03:43:41.150 --> 03:43:41.160 align:start position:0%
we're changing we're adding we're
 
03:43:44.809 --> 03:43:44.819 align:start position:0%
increasing security and the word um
 
03:43:47.389 --> 03:43:47.399 align:start position:0%
domicile and residence
 
03:43:49.969 --> 03:43:49.979 align:start position:0%
we're giving special privileges
 
03:43:51.950 --> 03:43:51.960 align:start position:0%
special privileges again this is from
 
03:43:54.050 --> 03:43:54.060 align:start position:0%
the University of New Hampshire's main
 
03:43:57.229 --> 03:43:57.239 align:start position:0%
voting website it says and I quote
 
03:44:00.349 --> 03:44:00.359 align:start position:0%
Additionally the legislative legislature
 
03:44:02.630 --> 03:44:02.640 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire did directly give
 
03:44:04.870 --> 03:44:04.880 align:start position:0%
college students the special privileges
 
03:44:08.210 --> 03:44:08.220 align:start position:0%
on that does not normally apply to a New
 
03:44:10.490 --> 03:44:10.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire citizen from the from the
 
03:44:12.830 --> 03:44:12.840 align:start position:0%
voting page the web page New Hampshire
 
03:44:15.050 --> 03:44:15.060 align:start position:0%
election law provides college students
 
03:44:17.389 --> 03:44:17.399 align:start position:0%
with special privileges that's them not
 
03:44:19.910 --> 03:44:19.920 align:start position:0%
me saying that when determining where
 
03:44:21.590 --> 03:44:21.600 align:start position:0%
they register to vote the college
 
03:44:23.870 --> 03:44:23.880 align:start position:0%
student in New Hampshire may choose as
 
03:44:26.630 --> 03:44:26.640 align:start position:0%
his voting domicile either the domicile
 
03:44:29.870 --> 03:44:29.880 align:start position:0%
they held before entering College are a
 
03:44:31.429 --> 03:44:31.439 align:start position:0%
domicile they established while
 
03:44:33.050 --> 03:44:33.060 align:start position:0%
attending college
 
03:44:36.170 --> 03:44:36.180 align:start position:0%
students may only select one
 
03:44:38.990 --> 03:44:39.000 align:start position:0%
once again the regular citizen doesn't
 
03:44:41.690 --> 03:44:41.700 align:start position:0%
have this opportunity in New Hampshire
 
03:44:43.790 --> 03:44:43.800 align:start position:0%
when registering to vote this is from
 
03:44:45.950 --> 03:44:45.960 align:start position:0%
the website again you need to have
 
03:44:48.910 --> 03:44:48.920 align:start position:0%
identity some photo ID
 
03:44:51.590 --> 03:44:51.600 align:start position:0%
such as a valid driver's license or form
 
03:44:54.110 --> 03:44:54.120 align:start position:0%
of a New Hampshire ID for your
 
03:44:54.120 --> 03:44:54.910 align:start position:0%
of a New Hampshire ID for your
University

03:44:54.910 --> 03:44:54.920 align:start position:0%
University
 
03:44:56.990 --> 03:44:57.000 align:start position:0%
domicile your address for voting
 
03:44:59.870 --> 03:44:59.880 align:start position:0%
purposes you have to be age 18 and
 
03:45:02.570 --> 03:45:02.580 align:start position:0%
here's the one that gets me U.S citizens
 
03:45:04.670 --> 03:45:04.680 align:start position:0%
passport birth certificate or
 
03:45:07.370 --> 03:45:07.380 align:start position:0%
naturalization papers if you do not have
 
03:45:09.650 --> 03:45:09.660 align:start position:0%
one of these documents you can sign a
 
03:45:11.929 --> 03:45:11.939 align:start position:0%
document attesting to your citizenship
 
03:45:14.150 --> 03:45:14.160 align:start position:0%
why is this troubling
 
03:45:16.010 --> 03:45:16.020 align:start position:0%
who at the Secretary of State at the
 
03:45:17.630 --> 03:45:17.640 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice
 
03:45:19.969 --> 03:45:19.979 align:start position:0%
checks this does anybody
 
03:45:21.229 --> 03:45:21.239 align:start position:0%
of course not
 
03:45:23.450 --> 03:45:23.460 align:start position:0%
once again New Hampshire is the safest
 
03:45:26.389 --> 03:45:26.399 align:start position:0%
or the easiest place to vote but are we
 
03:45:28.809 --> 03:45:28.819 align:start position:0%
the most secure
 
03:45:32.090 --> 03:45:32.100 align:start position:0%
register to vote okay
 
03:45:34.070 --> 03:45:34.080 align:start position:0%
I'll close with this
 
03:45:34.080 --> 03:45:36.710 align:start position:0%
I'll close with this
um

03:45:36.710 --> 03:45:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:38.630 --> 03:45:38.640 align:start position:0%
how did we get here I think it's really
 
03:45:40.849 --> 03:45:40.859 align:start position:0%
important that we understand that
 
03:45:44.750 --> 03:45:44.760 align:start position:0%
HB 1264 in 2018 was passed by the
 
03:45:47.210 --> 03:45:47.220 align:start position:0%
legislature and signed by the governor
 
03:45:49.250 --> 03:45:49.260 align:start position:0%
and I believe unconstitutionally in
 
03:45:51.170 --> 03:45:51.180 align:start position:0%
violation of the Bill of Rights part one
 
03:45:54.830 --> 03:45:54.840 align:start position:0%
article 11 and part 2 article 30 without
 
03:45:58.969 --> 03:45:58.979 align:start position:0%
the consent of the people later RSA 21 6
 
03:46:02.590 --> 03:46:02.600 align:start position:0%
and 216a sponsored by Republicans
 
03:46:05.510 --> 03:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
unconstitutionally expanded to allow the
 
03:46:08.389 --> 03:46:08.399 align:start position:0%
expansion of absentee voters granting
 
03:46:11.750 --> 03:46:11.760 align:start position:0%
resident aliens the right to vote this
 
03:46:13.550 --> 03:46:13.560 align:start position:0%
once again was a violation of the New
 
03:46:16.729 --> 03:46:16.739 align:start position:0%
Hampshire constitution in my opinion New
 
03:46:19.070 --> 03:46:19.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution part one
 
03:46:21.530 --> 03:46:21.540 align:start position:0%
and the Bill of Rights in part two form
 
03:46:24.110 --> 03:46:24.120 align:start position:0%
of government this is very important the
 
03:46:27.050 --> 03:46:27.060 align:start position:0%
definition of inhabitant and appears 23
 
03:46:31.130 --> 03:46:31.140 align:start position:0%
times the term resident appears once in
 
03:46:32.929 --> 03:46:32.939 align:start position:0%
the form of government
 
03:46:32.939 --> 03:46:34.250 align:start position:0%
the form of government
that's

03:46:34.250 --> 03:46:34.260 align:start position:0%
that's
 
03:46:37.550 --> 03:46:37.560 align:start position:0%
clearly an indication of what the intent
 
03:46:39.349 --> 03:46:39.359 align:start position:0%
of the law was
 
03:46:42.290 --> 03:46:42.300 align:start position:0%
in regards to inhabitant there is no
 
03:46:43.969 --> 03:46:43.979 align:start position:0%
Authority for the legislator to change
 
03:46:46.070 --> 03:46:46.080 align:start position:0%
voting rights or give special privileges
 
03:46:48.530 --> 03:46:48.540 align:start position:0%
to resident aliens with or without
 
03:46:50.990 --> 03:46:51.000 align:start position:0%
altered domicile or resident status
 
03:46:55.550 --> 03:46:55.560 align:start position:0%
please vote to pass HP 405.
 
03:46:57.110 --> 03:46:57.120 align:start position:0%
and return back to the New Hampshire
 
03:46:59.150 --> 03:46:59.160 align:start position:0%
Constitution and correct this Sovereign
 
03:47:02.389 --> 03:47:02.399 align:start position:0%
violation and voting injustices that's
 
03:47:04.090 --> 03:47:04.100 align:start position:0%
been placed upon all New Hampshire
 
03:47:10.190 --> 03:47:10.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:15.950 --> 03:47:15.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:17.929 --> 03:47:17.939 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
03:47:19.729 --> 03:47:19.739 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:47:21.650 --> 03:47:21.660 align:start position:0%
um So based off of what you just said
 
03:47:24.229 --> 03:47:24.239 align:start position:0%
does that mean that um during the 2020
 
03:47:27.410 --> 03:47:27.420 align:start position:0%
elections students that were
 
03:47:29.630 --> 03:47:29.640 align:start position:0%
told to stay home and could not be on
 
03:47:33.050 --> 03:47:33.060 align:start position:0%
campus were they voting by absentee
 
03:47:35.750 --> 03:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
ballot from their school they could have
 
03:47:37.429 --> 03:47:37.439 align:start position:0%
yes they could have been in New Jersey
 
03:47:39.290 --> 03:47:39.300 align:start position:0%
voting absentee ballot in New Hampshire
 
03:47:41.630 --> 03:47:41.640 align:start position:0%
maybe voting in New Jersey too we don't
 
03:47:44.389 --> 03:47:44.399 align:start position:0%
know that the challenge for all of us in
 
03:47:46.190 --> 03:47:46.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is we make it and the
 
03:47:47.929 --> 03:47:47.939 align:start position:0%
secretary of state says that you know we
 
03:47:50.210 --> 03:47:50.220 align:start position:0%
make it the easiest place to vote but is
 
03:47:52.490 --> 03:47:52.500 align:start position:0%
it the most secure and here's the
 
03:47:55.010 --> 03:47:55.020 align:start position:0%
challenge with taxpayers that are
 
03:47:56.990 --> 03:47:57.000 align:start position:0%
funding the bills coming forward with
 
03:47:59.389 --> 03:47:59.399 align:start position:0%
three to five percent voting margins
 
03:48:01.429 --> 03:48:01.439 align:start position:0%
think about it in New Hampshire we had
 
03:48:05.570 --> 03:48:05.580 align:start position:0%
11 contested results last year in 2022.
 
03:48:08.630 --> 03:48:08.640 align:start position:0%
Senate District 24 is the big one that
 
03:48:10.729 --> 03:48:10.739 align:start position:0%
hasn't even been resolved yet in far as
 
03:48:13.190 --> 03:48:13.200 align:start position:0%
uh what happened there it didn't happen
 
03:48:15.530 --> 03:48:15.540 align:start position:0%
this is that's still on the plate at the
 
03:48:17.510 --> 03:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
election law committee uh not the
 
03:48:19.010 --> 03:48:19.020 align:start position:0%
election law committee the ballot law
 
03:48:22.370 --> 03:48:22.380 align:start position:0%
commission excuse me so my point is we
 
03:48:24.650 --> 03:48:24.660 align:start position:0%
need to make things a little bit more
 
03:48:27.050 --> 03:48:27.060 align:start position:0%
secure there's nobody checking these
 
03:48:28.729 --> 03:48:28.739 align:start position:0%
details the Secretary of State the
 
03:48:31.010 --> 03:48:31.020 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice nobody checks
 
03:48:33.769 --> 03:48:33.779 align:start position:0%
there is no check and balance and when
 
03:48:35.630 --> 03:48:35.640 align:start position:0%
we're the citizens are fronting these
 
03:48:38.269 --> 03:48:38.279 align:start position:0%
bills coming forward on education and
 
03:48:40.670 --> 03:48:40.680 align:start position:0%
all other things our say needs to be
 
03:48:43.370 --> 03:48:43.380 align:start position:0%
more important than in my opinion than
 
03:48:45.469 --> 03:48:45.479 align:start position:0%
people who aren't here for the end
 
03:48:45.479 --> 03:48:47.570 align:start position:0%
people who aren't here for the end
result

03:48:47.570 --> 03:48:47.580 align:start position:0%
result
 
03:48:49.130 --> 03:48:49.140 align:start position:0%
follow-up please
 
03:48:50.990 --> 03:48:51.000 align:start position:0%

03:48:59.570 --> 03:48:59.580 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot in New Hampshire if
 
03:49:01.370 --> 03:49:01.380 align:start position:0%
they're students of New Hampshire I
 
03:49:03.410 --> 03:49:03.420 align:start position:0%
don't know the answer to that but I I
 
03:49:04.849 --> 03:49:04.859 align:start position:0%
could try to find it for you but I
 
03:49:06.650 --> 03:49:06.660 align:start position:0%
really don't know I've never studied
 
03:49:09.650 --> 03:49:09.660 align:start position:0%
that okay thank you thank you
 
03:49:14.210 --> 03:49:14.220 align:start position:0%
president Barry I'm on a wave okay
 
03:49:19.070 --> 03:49:19.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:21.710 --> 03:49:21.720 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you
 
03:49:35.889 --> 03:49:35.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:40.070 --> 03:49:40.080 align:start position:0%
hello I am Lee Heath I attend the
 
03:49:42.050 --> 03:49:42.060 align:start position:0%
University of New Hampshire and I oppose
 
03:49:43.130 --> 03:49:43.140 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
03:49:46.550 --> 03:49:46.560 align:start position:0%
I am an out-of-state student from Maine
 
03:49:49.370 --> 03:49:49.380 align:start position:0%
um I am 17 so I have not yet voted but I
 
03:49:51.710 --> 03:49:51.720 align:start position:0%
can already see all the ways Laws affect
 
03:49:55.550 --> 03:49:55.560 align:start position:0%
my life I spend nearly half my life in
 
03:49:57.110 --> 03:49:57.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
03:50:00.050 --> 03:50:00.060 align:start position:0%
um studying I pay taxes on food when I
 
03:50:03.290 --> 03:50:03.300 align:start position:0%
go I am part of the workforce I work for
 
03:50:07.190 --> 03:50:07.200 align:start position:0%
minimum wage so my how much I earn is
 
03:50:09.650 --> 03:50:09.660 align:start position:0%
determined by votes here I know it's
 
03:50:11.290 --> 03:50:11.300 align:start position:0%
more than
 
03:50:15.469 --> 03:50:15.479 align:start position:0%
taxes and my wage determined by votes
 
03:50:19.450 --> 03:50:19.460 align:start position:0%
and almost every fragment of my life is
 
03:50:23.929 --> 03:50:23.939 align:start position:0%
determined by some sort of law and if I
 
03:50:26.690 --> 03:50:26.700 align:start position:0%
don't have a say there's so many rum
 
03:50:29.630 --> 03:50:29.640 align:start position:0%
there's so much room for abuse to
 
03:50:32.929 --> 03:50:32.939 align:start position:0%
exploit students who are coming here and
 
03:50:36.050 --> 03:50:36.060 align:start position:0%
trying to work for New Hampshire and
 
03:50:39.170 --> 03:50:39.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:41.570 --> 03:50:41.580 align:start position:0%
um these facts alone I believe earn my
 
03:50:44.570 --> 03:50:44.580 align:start position:0%
right to vote here and
 
03:50:44.580 --> 03:50:47.570 align:start position:0%
right to vote here and
um

03:50:47.570 --> 03:50:47.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:52.190 --> 03:50:52.200 align:start position:0%
because I live my life here I go home to
 
03:50:52.200 --> 03:50:53.389 align:start position:0%
because I live my life here I go home to
Maine

03:50:53.389 --> 03:50:53.399 align:start position:0%
Maine
 
03:50:57.110 --> 03:50:57.120 align:start position:0%
not nearly as much as I spend here
 
03:50:59.630 --> 03:50:59.640 align:start position:0%
also I hear stories of people attempting
 
03:51:02.870 --> 03:51:02.880 align:start position:0%
to vote with absentee's balance mailing
 
03:51:05.030 --> 03:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
it in on time and yet it gets lost in
 
03:51:08.210 --> 03:51:08.220 align:start position:0%
the shuffle removing their say and what
 
03:51:10.969 --> 03:51:10.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:13.969 --> 03:51:13.979 align:start position:0%
um thank you
 
03:51:19.309 --> 03:51:19.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:21.469 --> 03:51:21.479 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman thank you for taking
 
03:51:24.830 --> 03:51:24.840 align:start position:0%
my question do you feel that this bill
 
03:51:27.769 --> 03:51:27.779 align:start position:0%
will put a new burden for students to be
 
03:51:29.210 --> 03:51:29.220 align:start position:0%
able to vote
 
03:51:29.220 --> 03:51:31.610 align:start position:0%
able to vote
yes

03:51:31.610 --> 03:51:31.620 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:51:34.910 --> 03:51:34.920 align:start position:0%
um I I I believe it would
 
03:51:38.030 --> 03:51:38.040 align:start position:0%
make it so they can be abused in the
 
03:51:41.450 --> 03:51:41.460 align:start position:0%
system can I follow up oh
 
03:51:41.460 --> 03:51:43.130 align:start position:0%
system can I follow up oh
um

03:51:43.130 --> 03:51:43.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:51:45.769 --> 03:51:45.779 align:start position:0%
do you think that making it harder for
 
03:51:48.349 --> 03:51:48.359 align:start position:0%
students to vote makes voting in New
 
03:51:50.150 --> 03:51:50.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire more secure
 
03:51:53.690 --> 03:51:53.700 align:start position:0%
no I think making it harder means less
 
03:51:57.050 --> 03:51:57.060 align:start position:0%
vote overall a less idea of what people
 
03:52:01.729 --> 03:52:01.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:04.130 --> 03:52:04.140 align:start position:0%
representative Howard thank you Mr
 
03:52:05.389 --> 03:52:05.399 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
03:52:07.729 --> 03:52:07.739 align:start position:0%
question uh so I I understand that
 
03:52:09.469 --> 03:52:09.479 align:start position:0%
you're 17 so you haven't spent too much
 
03:52:11.809 --> 03:52:11.819 align:start position:0%
time at the University system but how
 
03:52:14.450 --> 03:52:14.460 align:start position:0%
much time have you spent or are you
 
03:52:16.250 --> 03:52:16.260 align:start position:0%
planning on spending in the state this
 
03:52:16.260 --> 03:52:17.030 align:start position:0%
planning on spending in the state this
year

03:52:17.030 --> 03:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
year
 
03:52:21.590 --> 03:52:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:23.330 --> 03:52:23.340 align:start position:0%
five days a week I
 
03:52:26.269 --> 03:52:26.279 align:start position:0%
guess here clubs work
 
03:52:26.279 --> 03:52:28.309 align:start position:0%
guess here clubs work
it

03:52:28.309 --> 03:52:28.319 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:52:30.950 --> 03:52:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:33.050 --> 03:52:33.060 align:start position:0%
okay one more question thank you very
 
03:52:39.349 --> 03:52:39.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:45.050 --> 03:52:45.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:47.690 --> 03:52:47.700 align:start position:0%
and correct me if I'm wrong no that's
 
03:53:01.750 --> 03:53:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:04.250 --> 03:53:04.260 align:start position:0%
good afternoon and thank you members of
 
03:53:06.950 --> 03:53:06.960 align:start position:0%

Alice house I live in Durham New
 
03:53:13.070 --> 03:53:13.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I oppose house bill 405. I
 
03:53:14.690 --> 03:53:14.700 align:start position:0%
am a third year at the University of New
 
03:53:14.700 --> 03:53:15.710 align:start position:0%
am a third year at the University of New
Hampshire

03:53:15.710 --> 03:53:15.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
03:53:17.510 --> 03:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
three years ago I moved to New Hampshire
 
03:53:19.969 --> 03:53:19.979 align:start position:0%
to attend UNH and I've grown to really
 
03:53:21.530 --> 03:53:21.540 align:start position:0%
love this state
 
03:53:23.809 --> 03:53:23.819 align:start position:0%
being involved in politics here has been
 
03:53:25.610 --> 03:53:25.620 align:start position:0%
actually one of my major sources of
 
03:53:25.620 --> 03:53:26.809 align:start position:0%
actually one of my major sources of
community

03:53:26.809 --> 03:53:26.819 align:start position:0%
community
 
03:53:28.929 --> 03:53:28.939 align:start position:0%
since I became a New Hampshire voter
 
03:53:31.849 --> 03:53:31.859 align:start position:0%
registering last fall I have really
 
03:53:33.849 --> 03:53:33.859 align:start position:0%
noticed a change in myself
 
03:53:36.889 --> 03:53:36.899 align:start position:0%
before I considered my Homestay my home
 
03:53:39.050 --> 03:53:39.060 align:start position:0%
now I really feel invested in the future
 
03:53:41.269 --> 03:53:41.279 align:start position:0%
of this state I'm interested in what's
 
03:53:44.570 --> 03:53:44.580 align:start position:0%
going on here in the in the legislature
 
03:53:46.790 --> 03:53:46.800 align:start position:0%
building and I really consider this my
 
03:53:48.650 --> 03:53:48.660 align:start position:0%
home and I'm considering staying out
 
03:53:50.630 --> 03:53:50.640 align:start position:0%
east specifically New Hampshire after
 
03:53:50.640 --> 03:53:52.010 align:start position:0%
east specifically New Hampshire after
graduation

03:53:52.010 --> 03:53:52.020 align:start position:0%
graduation
 
03:53:53.630 --> 03:53:53.640 align:start position:0%
uh there are a lot of great things about
 
03:53:55.130 --> 03:53:55.140 align:start position:0%
the state and there are a lot of ways
 
03:53:57.229 --> 03:53:57.239 align:start position:0%
that I think it could be even better
 
03:53:59.030 --> 03:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
um and I think that if you want young
 
03:54:01.969 --> 03:54:01.979 align:start position:0%
people to stay in New Hampshire
 
03:54:04.190 --> 03:54:04.200 align:start position:0%
um you need to allow them some say
 
03:54:05.809 --> 03:54:05.819 align:start position:0%
in its future
 
03:54:08.330 --> 03:54:08.340 align:start position:0%
if this bill was in effect
 
03:54:10.429 --> 03:54:10.439 align:start position:0%
um back when I registered to vote I
 
03:54:11.870 --> 03:54:11.880 align:start position:0%
would not have been able to register to
 
03:54:13.429 --> 03:54:13.439 align:start position:0%
vote because I'm paying out of state
 
03:54:13.439 --> 03:54:14.389 align:start position:0%
vote because I'm paying out of state
tuition

03:54:14.389 --> 03:54:14.399 align:start position:0%
tuition
 
03:54:16.550 --> 03:54:16.560 align:start position:0%
and this bill might seem like a
 
03:54:18.830 --> 03:54:18.840 align:start position:0%
technicality a matter of numbers but to
 
03:54:20.570 --> 03:54:20.580 align:start position:0%
me it feels like I'm being looked in the
 
03:54:23.210 --> 03:54:23.220 align:start position:0%
face and told that even though I live
 
03:54:27.170 --> 03:54:27.180 align:start position:0%
here work here rent property here and
 
03:54:29.450 --> 03:54:29.460 align:start position:0%
hold Community here that my input should
 
03:54:30.889 --> 03:54:30.899 align:start position:0%
not matter
 
03:54:33.710 --> 03:54:33.720 align:start position:0%
I discussed this issue recently last
 
03:54:35.750 --> 03:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
fall with a mentor that I love and am
 
03:54:37.010 --> 03:54:37.020 align:start position:0%
very close to
 
03:54:38.750 --> 03:54:38.760 align:start position:0%
he thinks that out of state students
 
03:54:40.849 --> 03:54:40.859 align:start position:0%
should not vote here and his arguments
 
03:54:42.769 --> 03:54:42.779 align:start position:0%
suggested that student voters Were
 
03:54:45.290 --> 03:54:45.300 align:start position:0%
Somehow less important than other voters
 
03:54:47.570 --> 03:54:47.580 align:start position:0%
contrary to New Hampshire law
 
03:54:49.550 --> 03:54:49.560 align:start position:0%
he also talked about students as
 
03:54:52.309 --> 03:54:52.319 align:start position:0%
temporary when students as a demographic
 
03:54:53.990 --> 03:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
will always be here
 
03:54:55.969 --> 03:54:55.979 align:start position:0%
he also talked as if we threaten people
 
03:54:57.769 --> 03:54:57.779 align:start position:0%
who own property here and have lived
 
03:54:59.870 --> 03:54:59.880 align:start position:0%
here for a long time but the way I see
 
03:55:01.670 --> 03:55:01.680 align:start position:0%
it that shouldn't necessarily need to be
 
03:55:03.170 --> 03:55:03.180 align:start position:0%
true and our goals shouldn't have to be
 
03:55:03.180 --> 03:55:04.309 align:start position:0%
true and our goals shouldn't have to be
opposed

03:55:04.309 --> 03:55:04.319 align:start position:0%
opposed
 
03:55:07.250 --> 03:55:07.260 align:start position:0%
then I asked him if he was going to vote
 
03:55:08.990 --> 03:55:09.000 align:start position:0%
in the election
 
03:55:11.510 --> 03:55:11.520 align:start position:0%
and he said no
 
03:55:13.370 --> 03:55:13.380 align:start position:0%
he said he didn't know enough about
 
03:55:15.290 --> 03:55:15.300 align:start position:0%
politics in New Hampshire specifically
 
03:55:18.349 --> 03:55:18.359 align:start position:0%
in Durham to vote yeah I said okay
 
03:55:19.670 --> 03:55:19.680 align:start position:0%
that's fair
 
03:55:21.889 --> 03:55:21.899 align:start position:0%
but at the time I talked to him he had
 
03:55:24.590 --> 03:55:24.600 align:start position:0%
had four days or he had four days still
 
03:55:26.689 --> 03:55:26.699 align:start position:0%
leading up to the election to talk to
 
03:55:28.189 --> 03:55:28.199 align:start position:0%
people in this community
 
03:55:30.710 --> 03:55:30.720 align:start position:0%
to learn about
 
03:55:30.720 --> 03:55:31.550 align:start position:0%
to learn about
um

03:55:31.550 --> 03:55:31.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:55:35.570 --> 03:55:35.580 align:start position:0%
to read articles and to go vote
 
03:55:37.370 --> 03:55:37.380 align:start position:0%
um not to mention he was living in New
 
03:55:38.570 --> 03:55:38.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and had months and months
 
03:55:40.610 --> 03:55:40.620 align:start position:0%
leading up to this election to do so
 
03:55:42.830 --> 03:55:42.840 align:start position:0%
and yet he didn't vote I asked him after
 
03:55:45.410 --> 03:55:45.420 align:start position:0%
the election just to make sure
 
03:55:48.410 --> 03:55:48.420 align:start position:0%
um meanwhile every student I know got
 
03:55:48.420 --> 03:55:49.610 align:start position:0%
um meanwhile every student I know got
involved

03:55:49.610 --> 03:55:49.620 align:start position:0%
involved
 
03:55:51.889 --> 03:55:51.899 align:start position:0%
did their research either sent their
 
03:55:53.570 --> 03:55:53.580 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot home
 
03:55:55.550 --> 03:55:55.560 align:start position:0%
or registered in New Hampshire and voted
 
03:55:55.560 --> 03:55:56.389 align:start position:0%
or registered in New Hampshire and voted
here

03:55:56.389 --> 03:55:56.399 align:start position:0%
here
 
03:55:58.969 --> 03:55:58.979 align:start position:0%
and voted and I think if students are
 
03:56:00.710 --> 03:56:00.720 align:start position:0%
residents here and are affected by these
 
03:56:02.689 --> 03:56:02.699 align:start position:0%
laws and we care about this process
 
03:56:05.030 --> 03:56:05.040 align:start position:0%
enough to get involved that they should
 
03:56:07.250 --> 03:56:07.260 align:start position:0%
not be excluded from voting
 
03:56:09.349 --> 03:56:09.359 align:start position:0%
I ask that you please protect this right
 
03:56:12.229 --> 03:56:12.239 align:start position:0%
by voted voting inexpedient to legislate
 
03:56:14.330 --> 03:56:14.340 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 405. thank you and I'm
 
03:56:15.950 --> 03:56:15.960 align:start position:0%
open to questions
 
03:56:17.990 --> 03:56:18.000 align:start position:0%

03:56:20.210 --> 03:56:20.220 align:start position:0%

year thank you
 
03:56:30.180 --> 03:56:31.790 align:start position:0%
year thank you
um

03:56:31.790 --> 03:56:31.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:56:34.490 --> 03:56:34.500 align:start position:0%
yes so I am in my third year of college
 
03:56:40.010 --> 03:56:40.020 align:start position:0%
so I began living here fall of 2020.
 
03:56:43.550 --> 03:56:43.560 align:start position:0%
um and I've just stayed here
 
03:56:47.570 --> 03:56:47.580 align:start position:0%
um I go home I've gone home twice for a
 
03:56:49.130 --> 03:56:49.140 align:start position:0%
period of
 
03:56:50.870 --> 03:56:50.880 align:start position:0%
two months
 
03:56:52.790 --> 03:56:52.800 align:start position:0%
for one summer two months for another
 
03:56:55.429 --> 03:56:55.439 align:start position:0%
summer and then come back here and that
 
03:56:57.530 --> 03:56:57.540 align:start position:0%
is what I've done
 
03:56:59.929 --> 03:56:59.939 align:start position:0%
thank you I have a question uh okay
 
03:57:02.630 --> 03:57:02.640 align:start position:0%
representative paper
 
03:57:04.309 --> 03:57:04.319 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman thank you for taking
 
03:57:05.689 --> 03:57:05.699 align:start position:0%
my call
 
03:57:08.030 --> 03:57:08.040 align:start position:0%
do you think that the passing of this
 
03:57:10.189 --> 03:57:10.199 align:start position:0%
bill will discourage young people from
 
03:57:13.490 --> 03:57:13.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:16.790 --> 03:57:16.800 align:start position:0%
um I think so and I think
 
03:57:18.710 --> 03:57:18.720 align:start position:0%
um the reason is that
 
03:57:21.050 --> 03:57:21.060 align:start position:0%
I've gotten really involved in groups on
 
03:57:21.060 --> 03:57:22.070 align:start position:0%
I've gotten really involved in groups on
campus

03:57:22.070 --> 03:57:22.080 align:start position:0%
campus
 
03:57:25.370 --> 03:57:25.380 align:start position:0%
um student organizations and such that
 
03:57:27.050 --> 03:57:27.060 align:start position:0%
um that participate in the political
 
03:57:29.929 --> 03:57:29.939 align:start position:0%
process and I felt that I've been much
 
03:57:31.550 --> 03:57:31.560 align:start position:0%
more engaged and much more interested in
 
03:57:31.560 --> 03:57:32.809 align:start position:0%
more engaged and much more interested in
that

03:57:32.809 --> 03:57:32.819 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:57:35.809 --> 03:57:35.819 align:start position:0%
once I've started voting here right and
 
03:57:35.819 --> 03:57:36.650 align:start position:0%
once I've started voting here right and
so

03:57:36.650 --> 03:57:36.660 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:57:38.870 --> 03:57:38.880 align:start position:0%
um I think that a lot of students could
 
03:57:40.490 --> 03:57:40.500 align:start position:0%
you know keep up with their home state
 
03:57:42.590 --> 03:57:42.600 align:start position:0%
could send home their ballot but a lot
 
03:57:45.410 --> 03:57:45.420 align:start position:0%
of students care a certain amount
 
03:57:48.469 --> 03:57:48.479 align:start position:0%
um but not always enough to listen to
 
03:57:51.110 --> 03:57:51.120 align:start position:0%
that news every day to you know figure
 
03:57:52.370 --> 03:57:52.380 align:start position:0%
out what's going on in their home state
 
03:57:55.189 --> 03:57:55.199 align:start position:0%
whereas I felt very involved here
 
03:57:56.929 --> 03:57:56.939 align:start position:0%
and I've just cared a lot more about
 
03:58:00.710 --> 03:58:00.720 align:start position:0%
voting here so I think that um
 
03:58:02.990 --> 03:58:03.000 align:start position:0%
I think that in some ways it would
 
03:58:05.929 --> 03:58:05.939 align:start position:0%
discourage students from becoming
 
03:58:07.670 --> 03:58:07.680 align:start position:0%
civically involved here just because
 
03:58:09.830 --> 03:58:09.840 align:start position:0%
it's easier to get civically involved
 
03:58:12.590 --> 03:58:12.600 align:start position:0%
where you live and you're around people
 
03:58:13.969 --> 03:58:13.979 align:start position:0%
um to discuss with
 
03:58:13.979 --> 03:58:14.929 align:start position:0%
um to discuss with
yes

03:58:14.929 --> 03:58:14.939 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:58:17.630 --> 03:58:17.640 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
03:58:20.450 --> 03:58:20.460 align:start position:0%
um this making it harder for UNH
 
03:58:22.670 --> 03:58:22.680 align:start position:0%
students to vote
 
03:58:24.530 --> 03:58:24.540 align:start position:0%
um do you feel that it makes
 
03:58:25.910 --> 03:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
um the election
 
03:58:29.809 --> 03:58:29.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:29.819 --> 03:58:30.889 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:58:30.889 --> 03:58:30.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:58:32.929 --> 03:58:32.939 align:start position:0%
personally I don't I think that depends
 
03:58:34.550 --> 03:58:34.560 align:start position:0%
on who you are and what your opinion is
 
03:58:36.110 --> 03:58:36.120 align:start position:0%
but I think that students are
 
03:58:38.750 --> 03:58:38.760 align:start position:0%
demographic that are going to be here
 
03:58:40.910 --> 03:58:40.920 align:start position:0%
um even if not everyone stays that's
 
03:58:42.530 --> 03:58:42.540 align:start position:0%
going to cycle through and so I don't
 
03:58:45.349 --> 03:58:45.359 align:start position:0%
believe it's more secure to
 
03:58:47.210 --> 03:58:47.220 align:start position:0%
um exclude out of state students from
 
03:58:47.220 --> 03:58:49.130 align:start position:0%
um exclude out of state students from
voting

03:58:49.130 --> 03:58:49.140 align:start position:0%
voting
 
03:58:52.729 --> 03:58:52.739 align:start position:0%
any further yeah I have a question do
 
03:58:56.990 --> 03:58:57.000 align:start position:0%
you have a New Hampshire ID or a main ID
 
03:58:59.210 --> 03:58:59.220 align:start position:0%
um I do not have a New Hampshire idea I
 
03:59:01.670 --> 03:59:01.680 align:start position:0%
have a Wisconsin ID and I'm working on
 
03:59:03.530 --> 03:59:03.540 align:start position:0%
getting that to New Hampshire ID and
 
03:59:06.950 --> 03:59:06.960 align:start position:0%
registering my car here okay thank you
 
03:59:09.590 --> 03:59:09.600 align:start position:0%
every time weary
 
03:59:11.150 --> 03:59:11.160 align:start position:0%
do you plan on
 
03:59:13.849 --> 03:59:13.859 align:start position:0%
um so we have a another local elections
 
03:59:15.889 --> 03:59:15.899 align:start position:0%
coming up in March are you
 
03:59:18.170 --> 03:59:18.180 align:start position:0%
actively involved in that and are you
 
03:59:20.210 --> 03:59:20.220 align:start position:0%
looking to vote in that particular
 
03:59:20.220 --> 03:59:21.469 align:start position:0%
looking to vote in that particular
election

03:59:21.469 --> 03:59:21.479 align:start position:0%

um activity level and is there I mean
 
03:59:41.809 --> 03:59:41.819 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to understand yeah if
 
03:59:44.570 --> 03:59:44.580 align:start position:0%
it's beyond the presidential elections
 
03:59:46.429 --> 03:59:46.439 align:start position:0%
or the you know kind of midterm
 
03:59:48.050 --> 03:59:48.060 align:start position:0%
elections but it's actually extending
 
03:59:50.809 --> 03:59:50.819 align:start position:0%
down into the local community right
 
03:59:53.510 --> 03:59:53.520 align:start position:0%

I mean I'm so surprised by everyone I
 
04:00:16.910 --> 04:00:16.920 align:start position:0%
talk to a lot of people already know
 
04:00:19.070 --> 04:00:19.080 align:start position:0%
what's going on or would like to learn
 
04:00:19.080 --> 04:00:20.389 align:start position:0%
what's going on or would like to learn
more

04:00:20.389 --> 04:00:20.399 align:start position:0%
more
 
04:00:22.490 --> 04:00:22.500 align:start position:0%
um so I would say that a lot of students
 
04:00:24.170 --> 04:00:24.180 align:start position:0%
at least the students that I'm around
 
04:00:26.150 --> 04:00:26.160 align:start position:0%
which is a lot of students that I'm
 
04:00:27.410 --> 04:00:27.420 align:start position:0%
interacting with
 
04:00:31.309 --> 04:00:31.319 align:start position:0%
um day to day are clued in or want to be
 
04:00:32.870 --> 04:00:32.880 align:start position:0%
included in
 
04:00:35.030 --> 04:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
um to all the different elections and
 
04:00:37.490 --> 04:00:37.500 align:start position:0%
not just presidential I mean the one I
 
04:00:39.050 --> 04:00:39.060 align:start position:0%
was referring to that we did a lot of
 
04:00:42.050 --> 04:00:42.060 align:start position:0%
work for was the November elections um
 
04:00:44.269 --> 04:00:44.279 align:start position:0%
which I know are also very important but
 
04:00:46.309 --> 04:00:46.319 align:start position:0%
all the elections are important and um I
 
04:00:47.990 --> 04:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
know that I will be voting and
 
04:00:49.969 --> 04:00:49.979 align:start position:0%
everything that I can
 
04:00:51.650 --> 04:00:51.660 align:start position:0%
um and I believe a lot of other students
 
04:00:53.330 --> 04:00:53.340 align:start position:0%
will be too all right thank you thank
 
04:00:53.340 --> 04:00:54.950 align:start position:0%
will be too all right thank you thank
you

04:00:54.950 --> 04:00:54.960 align:start position:0%

04:00:57.950 --> 04:00:57.960 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you so much thank you
 
04:01:00.349 --> 04:01:00.359 align:start position:0%

anybody else want to speak if not
 
04:01:05.210 --> 04:01:05.220 align:start position:0%
representative would you give me the
 
04:01:07.309 --> 04:01:07.319 align:start position:0%
blue sheet please
 
04:01:11.030 --> 04:01:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:17.990 --> 04:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:18.000 --> 04:01:22.910 align:start position:0%
 
405.

04:01:22.910 --> 04:01:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:27.490 --> 04:01:27.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:30.769 --> 04:01:30.779 align:start position:0%
thank you for the help
 
04:01:34.729 --> 04:01:34.739 align:start position:0%
thank you so we have one two three four
 
04:01:37.429 --> 04:01:37.439 align:start position:0%
four and four against
 
04:01:39.769 --> 04:01:39.779 align:start position:0%
okay with that I'm closing the hearing
 
04:01:39.779 --> 04:01:40.610 align:start position:0%
okay with that I'm closing the hearing
on

04:01:40.610 --> 04:01:40.620 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:01:43.189 --> 04:01:43.199 align:start position:0%
House Bill 405 and in a few minutes
 
04:01:48.830 --> 04:01:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:48.840 --> 04:01:57.229 align:start position:0%
 
179.

04:01:57.229 --> 04:01:57.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:57.239 --> 04:05:36.769 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:05:36.769 --> 04:05:36.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:40.429 --> 04:05:40.439 align:start position:0%
foreign and it's now two o'clock
 
04:05:43.990 --> 04:05:44.000 align:start position:0%
and open the hearing on House Bill 179
 
04:05:47.689 --> 04:05:47.699 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I do not see the sponsor
 
04:05:49.130 --> 04:05:49.140 align:start position:0%
in the room
 
04:05:49.140 --> 04:05:50.929 align:start position:0%
in the room
so

04:05:50.929 --> 04:05:50.939 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:05:53.330 --> 04:05:53.340 align:start position:0%
would somebody just want to
 
04:05:55.250 --> 04:05:55.260 align:start position:0%
open up the bill and we can take
 
04:05:55.260 --> 04:06:00.050 align:start position:0%
open up the bill and we can take
testimony

04:06:00.050 --> 04:06:00.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:06.290 --> 04:06:06.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:08.030 --> 04:06:08.040 align:start position:0%
you don't have to say you're for or
 
04:06:10.189 --> 04:06:10.199 align:start position:0%
against it because
 
04:06:10.199 --> 04:06:15.769 align:start position:0%
against it because
foreign

04:06:15.769 --> 04:06:15.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:18.889 --> 04:06:18.899 align:start position:0%
okay I'd like to introduce Bill 179 up
 
04:06:21.469 --> 04:06:21.479 align:start position:0%
for public hearing this bill amends the
 
04:06:24.410 --> 04:06:24.420 align:start position:0%
definition of elect electioneering to
 
04:06:26.570 --> 04:06:26.580 align:start position:0%
remove the prohibition against wearing
 
04:06:29.630 --> 04:06:29.640 align:start position:0%
clothing or paraphernalia that a
 
04:06:30.889 --> 04:06:30.899 align:start position:0%
reasonable person would believe
 
04:06:34.189 --> 04:06:34.199 align:start position:0%
explicitly advocates for or against any
 
04:06:37.490 --> 04:06:37.500 align:start position:0%
candidate political party or measure
 
04:06:40.309 --> 04:06:40.319 align:start position:0%
being voted
 
04:06:41.630 --> 04:06:41.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:06:43.610 --> 04:06:43.620 align:start position:0%
I now call
 
04:06:47.750 --> 04:06:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:50.570 --> 04:06:50.580 align:start position:0%
don't they fix this last year
 
04:06:53.090 --> 04:06:53.100 align:start position:0%
it doesn't fix this I continue to be
 
04:06:54.530 --> 04:06:54.540 align:start position:0%
representative Timothy Horrigan from
 
04:06:56.990 --> 04:06:57.000 align:start position:0%
Stratford County District 10 and um I
 
04:06:58.490 --> 04:06:58.500 align:start position:0%
probably actually will be brief this
 
04:06:59.929 --> 04:06:59.939 align:start position:0%
time um
 
04:07:01.550 --> 04:07:01.560 align:start position:0%
so I
 
04:07:01.560 --> 04:07:02.269 align:start position:0%
so I
I

04:07:02.269 --> 04:07:02.279 align:start position:0%
I
 
04:07:02.279 --> 04:07:03.710 align:start position:0%
I
um

04:07:03.710 --> 04:07:03.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:07:06.229 --> 04:07:06.239 align:start position:0%
so I guess and of course uh the bill
 
04:07:08.269 --> 04:07:08.279 align:start position:0%
um it's self-explanatory just heard the
 
04:07:09.290 --> 04:07:09.300 align:start position:0%
whole uh
 
04:07:10.910 --> 04:07:10.920 align:start position:0%
basically just heard the whole thing
 
04:07:14.870 --> 04:07:14.880 align:start position:0%
there which is um for many years it's uh
 
04:07:16.670 --> 04:07:16.680 align:start position:0%
been against well not really against the
 
04:07:17.870 --> 04:07:17.880 align:start position:0%
law it'd be pretty I don't think
 
04:07:19.429 --> 04:07:19.439 align:start position:0%
anyone's ever been arrested for this but
 
04:07:21.050 --> 04:07:21.060 align:start position:0%
you're not supposed to wear
 
04:07:23.929 --> 04:07:23.939 align:start position:0%
buttons t-shirts hats
 
04:07:27.050 --> 04:07:27.060 align:start position:0%
Etc which are for against a candidate or
 
04:07:29.030 --> 04:07:29.040 align:start position:0%
a measure on the ballot into the in the
 
04:07:31.729 --> 04:07:31.739 align:start position:0%
into the polling place and although
 
04:07:34.250 --> 04:07:34.260 align:start position:0%
a lot of those do like slip through the
 
04:07:35.870 --> 04:07:35.880 align:start position:0%
cracks so like unless you have an
 
04:07:38.870 --> 04:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
especially uh zealous moderator uh
 
04:07:40.490 --> 04:07:40.500 align:start position:0%
they'll usually just pretend they didn't
 
04:07:42.710 --> 04:07:42.720 align:start position:0%
see the item an electric boat but I
 
04:07:42.720 --> 04:07:43.910 align:start position:0%
see the item an electric boat but I
think

04:07:43.910 --> 04:07:43.920 align:start position:0%
think
 
04:07:46.070 --> 04:07:46.080 align:start position:0%
I think it's valuable
 
04:07:47.389 --> 04:07:47.399 align:start position:0%
um well I'm going to say something which
 
04:07:49.130 --> 04:07:49.140 align:start position:0%
I got ridiculed for in the different
 
04:07:52.130 --> 04:07:52.140 align:start position:0%
context a few years ago which was the uh
 
04:07:55.010 --> 04:07:55.020 align:start position:0%
uh polling place is not a free speech
 
04:07:56.570 --> 04:07:56.580 align:start position:0%
zone so this is not a Zone where you're
 
04:07:58.070 --> 04:07:58.080 align:start position:0%
supposed to be electioneering or
 
04:08:02.150 --> 04:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
campaigning and actually uh they uh
 
04:08:04.610 --> 04:08:04.620 align:start position:0%
you know they and they they're trying uh
 
04:08:06.410 --> 04:08:06.420 align:start position:0%
trying to preserve that in this bill but
 
04:08:08.510 --> 04:08:08.520 align:start position:0%
I think keeping the existing uh
 
04:08:10.370 --> 04:08:10.380 align:start position:0%
restriction in place I think makes it
 
04:08:12.349 --> 04:08:12.359 align:start position:0%
makes it clearer you could you will
 
04:08:15.170 --> 04:08:15.180 align:start position:0%
fewer cases where somebody's will claim
 
04:08:17.330 --> 04:08:17.340 align:start position:0%
we'll be doing more than just wearing
 
04:08:18.830 --> 04:08:18.840 align:start position:0%
the article clothing and then claim well
 
04:08:20.870 --> 04:08:20.880 align:start position:0%
all I was doing was wearing the article
 
04:08:22.670 --> 04:08:22.680 align:start position:0%
of clothing so you have some of that but
 
04:08:24.410 --> 04:08:24.420 align:start position:0%
also I think it's a good idea
 
04:08:26.030 --> 04:08:26.040 align:start position:0%
not to have this stuff in the polling
 
04:08:27.710 --> 04:08:27.720 align:start position:0%
place it's supposed to be a neutral safe
 
04:08:29.389 --> 04:08:29.399 align:start position:0%
Zone where you're uh of course that's
 
04:08:31.309 --> 04:08:31.319 align:start position:0%
probably another unpopular phrase safe
 
04:08:33.410 --> 04:08:33.420 align:start position:0%
Zone but um
 
04:08:36.110 --> 04:08:36.120 align:start position:0%
or safe place but uh you were supposed
 
04:08:38.030 --> 04:08:38.040 align:start position:0%
to cast a balancing count them securely
 
04:08:40.070 --> 04:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
and um
 
04:08:41.630 --> 04:08:41.640 align:start position:0%
another thing this is going to do is
 
04:08:44.330 --> 04:08:44.340 align:start position:0%
going to let you wear your uh
 
04:08:46.309 --> 04:08:46.319 align:start position:0%
where your buttons your articles of
 
04:08:50.389 --> 04:08:50.399 align:start position:0%
clothing uh within the 100 mile 100 not
 
04:08:53.330 --> 04:08:53.340 align:start position:0%
100 mile 100 foot radius of the polling
 
04:08:56.170 --> 04:08:56.180 align:start position:0%
place and that's uh also a
 
04:08:59.630 --> 04:08:59.640 align:start position:0%
zone that we'd like to keep clear for
 
04:08:59.640 --> 04:09:00.530 align:start position:0%
zone that we'd like to keep clear for
various

04:09:00.530 --> 04:09:00.540 align:start position:0%
various
 
04:09:02.210 --> 04:09:02.220 align:start position:0%
various reasons so you probably have
 
04:09:04.370 --> 04:09:04.380 align:start position:0%
people congregating inside the 100 foot
 
04:09:06.349 --> 04:09:06.359 align:start position:0%
Zone and that actually
 
04:09:07.729 --> 04:09:07.739 align:start position:0%
there's a bill that's being heard in
 
04:09:09.710 --> 04:09:09.720 align:start position:0%
criminal justice and I'm the prime and
 
04:09:11.630 --> 04:09:11.640 align:start position:0%
only sponsor of and it'll be at the
 
04:09:13.610 --> 04:09:13.620 align:start position:0%
floor eventually where
 
04:09:16.729 --> 04:09:16.739 align:start position:0%
um well it's Banning carrying firearms
 
04:09:18.410 --> 04:09:18.420 align:start position:0%
um in the polling place that's another
 
04:09:20.530 --> 04:09:20.540 align:start position:0%
constitutional right which is probably
 
04:09:22.670 --> 04:09:22.680 align:start position:0%
temporary which you have outside the
 
04:09:24.769 --> 04:09:24.779 align:start position:0%
polling place in the 100 yard radius but
 
04:09:24.779 --> 04:09:25.510 align:start position:0%
polling place in the 100 yard radius but
not

04:09:25.510 --> 04:09:25.520 align:start position:0%
not
 
04:09:28.370 --> 04:09:28.380 align:start position:0%
unimpeded inside that zone then
 
04:09:30.590 --> 04:09:30.600 align:start position:0%
one of my Arguments for that's been on
 
04:09:31.670 --> 04:09:31.680 align:start position:0%
the written testimony of Criminal
 
04:09:33.530 --> 04:09:33.540 align:start position:0%
Justice is that in case the 100 foot
 
04:09:35.389 --> 04:09:35.399 align:start position:0%
sign is missing
 
04:09:37.550 --> 04:09:37.560 align:start position:0%
the gun owner can tell where the zone is
 
04:09:38.929 --> 04:09:38.939 align:start position:0%
because there will be people gathered
 
04:09:41.630 --> 04:09:41.640 align:start position:0%
101 feet from the entrance of the
 
04:09:43.490 --> 04:09:43.500 align:start position:0%
polling place with their signs and their
 
04:09:45.590 --> 04:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
signs and their paraphernalia so that'll
 
04:09:45.600 --> 04:09:46.550 align:start position:0%
signs and their paraphernalia so that'll
uh

04:09:46.550 --> 04:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:09:49.490 --> 04:09:49.500 align:start position:0%
create more confusion for the unwitting
 
04:09:51.889 --> 04:09:51.899 align:start position:0%
gun owner who's accidentally wandering
 
04:09:54.349 --> 04:09:54.359 align:start position:0%
into the polling place uh he won't know
 
04:09:56.750 --> 04:09:56.760 align:start position:0%
where that hundred foot zone is as
 
04:09:59.389 --> 04:09:59.399 align:start position:0%
easily as you know if either the sign is
 
04:10:01.250 --> 04:10:01.260 align:start position:0%
missing or he doesn't see the signs so
 
04:10:03.710 --> 04:10:03.720 align:start position:0%
that's one more
 
04:10:05.450 --> 04:10:05.460 align:start position:0%
um I mean that's that's probably
 
04:10:07.370 --> 04:10:07.380 align:start position:0%
slightly uh that's probably a slightly
 
04:10:09.410 --> 04:10:09.420 align:start position:0%
uh maybe that's a slightly snarky
 
04:10:10.790 --> 04:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
observation but I just thought I'd
 
04:10:13.309 --> 04:10:13.319 align:start position:0%
mention that that is like there will be
 
04:10:15.650 --> 04:10:15.660 align:start position:0%
additional difficulty of both this bill
 
04:10:18.889 --> 04:10:18.899 align:start position:0%
and that bill passes uh which
 
04:10:21.050 --> 04:10:21.060 align:start position:0%
um so I would just urge you to keep keep
 
04:10:23.630 --> 04:10:23.640 align:start position:0%
the law where way it is I mean it's fine
 
04:10:25.189 --> 04:10:25.199 align:start position:0%
if somebody accidentally gets through
 
04:10:26.809 --> 04:10:26.819 align:start position:0%
with their hat or their button or their
 
04:10:29.030 --> 04:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
son or their shirt on it's okay for the
 
04:10:31.790 --> 04:10:31.800 align:start position:0%
moderator to look the other weight if
 
04:10:34.070 --> 04:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
it's just a minor uh violation but I
 
04:10:35.330 --> 04:10:35.340 align:start position:0%
don't think we should I think we should
 
04:10:38.269 --> 04:10:38.279 align:start position:0%
keep the uh restriction in place so just
 
04:10:40.250 --> 04:10:40.260 align:start position:0%
for the neutrality and the safety of the
 
04:10:42.950 --> 04:10:42.960 align:start position:0%
polling place so that's all I have to
 
04:10:45.830 --> 04:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
say about it please itl I guess if you
 
04:10:46.969 --> 04:10:46.979 align:start position:0%
want to ask me questions you're welcome
 
04:10:48.590 --> 04:10:48.600 align:start position:0%
to whether I'll be able to answer them
 
04:10:50.229 --> 04:10:50.239 align:start position:0%
or not it's a whole nother
 
04:10:53.330 --> 04:10:53.340 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
04:10:56.870 --> 04:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
I have one because I thought I wasn't on
 
04:10:59.809 --> 04:10:59.819 align:start position:0%
Election law last year but I remember I
 
04:11:01.729 --> 04:11:01.739 align:start position:0%
thought we passed a bill last year or
 
04:11:04.490 --> 04:11:04.500 align:start position:0%
something where I would just only
 
04:11:07.910 --> 04:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
applied to people working
 
04:11:11.030 --> 04:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
in the election because I was told that
 
04:11:14.510 --> 04:11:14.520 align:start position:0%
I could walk in with my son my Badges
 
04:11:17.389 --> 04:11:17.399 align:start position:0%
and and whatever but I couldn't work in
 
04:11:19.550 --> 04:11:19.560 align:start position:0%
the in the role do you know anything
 
04:11:21.950 --> 04:11:21.960 align:start position:0%
about that I don't specifically I don't
 
04:11:23.929 --> 04:11:23.939 align:start position:0%
remember the exact details of the bill I
 
04:11:23.939 --> 04:11:24.950 align:start position:0%
remember the exact details of the bill I
uh

04:11:24.950 --> 04:11:24.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:11:27.889 --> 04:11:27.899 align:start position:0%
don't have the RSA 652 in front of me
 
04:11:29.990 --> 04:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
that uh it's possible but I think it's
 
04:11:31.429 --> 04:11:31.439 align:start position:0%
still better to keep it the way it was
 
04:11:32.929 --> 04:11:32.939 align:start position:0%
than probably even
 
04:11:38.630 --> 04:11:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:38.640 --> 04:11:41.510 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:11:41.510 --> 04:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:45.830 --> 04:11:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:47.689 --> 04:11:47.699 align:start position:0%
with that
 
04:11:49.010 --> 04:11:49.020 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:11:52.189 --> 04:11:52.199 align:start position:0%
so anybody else want to speak on the
 
04:11:52.199 --> 04:11:54.170 align:start position:0%
so anybody else want to speak on the
bill

04:11:54.170 --> 04:11:54.180 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:11:57.349 --> 04:11:57.359 align:start position:0%
with that I'll close the hearing on HP
 
04:12:01.929 --> 04:12:01.939 align:start position:0%
179 and we have a 50 minute break
 
04:12:04.610 --> 04:12:04.620 align:start position:0%
break out the cards and I mean I'm
 
04:12:04.620 --> 04:12:06.710 align:start position:0%
break out the cards and I mean I'm
joking

04:12:06.710 --> 04:12:06.720 align:start position:0%
joking
 
05:04:19.490 --> 05:04:19.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:19.500 --> 05:04:22.250 align:start position:0%
 
it's

05:04:22.250 --> 05:04:22.260 align:start position:0%
it's
 
05:04:26.090 --> 05:04:26.100 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you fellow
 
05:04:29.868 --> 05:04:29.878 align:start position:0%
representatives and uh committee members
 
05:04:31.970 --> 05:04:31.980 align:start position:0%
um for the record my name is Jerry
 
05:04:31.980 --> 05:04:34.010 align:start position:0%
um for the record my name is Jerry
Cannon

05:04:34.010 --> 05:04:34.020 align:start position:0%
Cannon
 
05:04:37.368 --> 05:04:37.378 align:start position:0%
um I represent uh Stratford County
 
05:04:41.030 --> 05:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
District 12. that's Somersworth and
 
05:04:41.040 --> 05:04:43.550 align:start position:0%
District 12. that's Somersworth and
Rollinsford

05:04:43.550 --> 05:04:43.560 align:start position:0%
Rollinsford
 
05:04:47.050 --> 05:04:47.060 align:start position:0%
this bill was fairly straightforward
 
05:04:50.390 --> 05:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
we've all been here before we've put out
 
05:04:54.650 --> 05:04:54.660 align:start position:0%
our signs our campaign signs and or
 
05:04:56.990 --> 05:04:57.000 align:start position:0%
people put them out for us and then you
 
05:04:58.128 --> 05:04:58.138 align:start position:0%
go looking for them and they're
 
05:04:58.138 --> 05:04:59.810 align:start position:0%
go looking for them and they're
disappeared

05:04:59.810 --> 05:04:59.820 align:start position:0%
disappeared
 
05:05:02.990 --> 05:05:03.000 align:start position:0%
so you first place to check the highway
 
05:05:03.000 --> 05:05:04.430 align:start position:0%
so you first place to check the highway
department

05:05:04.430 --> 05:05:04.440 align:start position:0%
department
 
05:05:07.368 --> 05:05:07.378 align:start position:0%
and usually there's a pile of them
 
05:05:10.730 --> 05:05:10.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:12.288 --> 05:05:12.298 align:start position:0%
the um
 
05:05:14.208 --> 05:05:14.218 align:start position:0%
so we'll check a couple of times during
 
05:05:17.330 --> 05:05:17.340 align:start position:0%
during the campaigns and find signs and
 
05:05:19.550 --> 05:05:19.560 align:start position:0%
help each other out if if there are
 
05:05:20.890 --> 05:05:20.900 align:start position:0%
signs of
 
05:05:23.570 --> 05:05:23.580 align:start position:0%
our fellow campaign
 
05:05:26.270 --> 05:05:26.280 align:start position:0%
members we try and pick them up and hand
 
05:05:29.090 --> 05:05:29.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:29.100 --> 05:05:30.890 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:05:30.890 --> 05:05:30.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:05:33.170 --> 05:05:33.180 align:start position:0%
we ran into an interesting Challenge and
 
05:05:34.850 --> 05:05:34.860 align:start position:0%
Summer's worth this bad time and I found
 
05:05:38.390 --> 05:05:38.400 align:start position:0%
out it's it's happened in other
 
05:05:38.400 --> 05:05:39.410 align:start position:0%
out it's it's happened in other
um

05:05:39.410 --> 05:05:39.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:05:42.410 --> 05:05:42.420 align:start position:0%
other locations as well
 
05:05:44.448 --> 05:05:44.458 align:start position:0%
um our
 
05:05:46.490 --> 05:05:46.500 align:start position:0%
director of the public works department
 
05:05:49.850 --> 05:05:49.860 align:start position:0%
was out for a couple of weeks
 
05:05:53.570 --> 05:05:53.580 align:start position:0%
and he left his supervisor in charge and
 
05:05:57.890 --> 05:05:57.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:59.690 --> 05:05:59.700 align:start position:0%
the statue
 
05:06:02.930 --> 05:06:02.940 align:start position:0%
and the statute about signs was
 
05:06:05.270 --> 05:06:05.280 align:start position:0%
specifically political advertising
 
05:06:07.970 --> 05:06:07.980 align:start position:0%
removed prior to election day
 
05:06:10.850 --> 05:06:10.860 align:start position:0%
by state city or town maintenance or law
 
05:06:13.550 --> 05:06:13.560 align:start position:0%
enforcement Personnel shall be kept
 
05:06:17.390 --> 05:06:17.400 align:start position:0%
until one week after the election at a
 
05:06:19.610 --> 05:06:19.620 align:start position:0%
place designated by the state city or
 
05:06:23.208 --> 05:06:23.218 align:start position:0%
town so that the candidate
 
05:06:26.390 --> 05:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
May retrieve the items and the
 
05:06:32.208 --> 05:06:32.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:34.430 --> 05:06:34.440 align:start position:0%
um up until this point and running many
 
05:06:36.830 --> 05:06:36.840 align:start position:0%
times I haven't had that problem I've
 
05:06:39.530 --> 05:06:39.540 align:start position:0%
usually been able to collect
 
05:06:42.110 --> 05:06:42.120 align:start position:0%
signs from for fellow Democrats and
 
05:06:45.288 --> 05:06:45.298 align:start position:0%
having a problem I also ran into one of
 
05:06:47.570 --> 05:06:47.580 align:start position:0%
the Republicans running for office and
 
05:06:50.868 --> 05:06:50.878 align:start position:0%
he said he had the same problem
 
05:06:54.770 --> 05:06:54.780 align:start position:0%
so I looked at the supervisor and I said
 
05:06:58.850 --> 05:06:58.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:01.970 --> 05:07:01.980 align:start position:0%
so I'm here to change the law
 
05:07:04.610 --> 05:07:04.620 align:start position:0%
so we've added a few words to it but
 
05:07:07.368 --> 05:07:07.378 align:start position:0%
essentially it's um
 
05:07:09.890 --> 05:07:09.900 align:start position:0%
so that the city or town so that the
 
05:07:12.530 --> 05:07:12.540 align:start position:0%
candidate or a member of the candidates
 
05:07:15.350 --> 05:07:15.360 align:start position:0%
campaign are local political Committee
 
05:07:18.230 --> 05:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
of the same party May retrieve
 
05:07:19.850 --> 05:07:19.860 align:start position:0%
the items
 
05:07:24.470 --> 05:07:24.480 align:start position:0%
so um that's essentially it because I
 
05:07:26.690 --> 05:07:26.700 align:start position:0%
wanted to be it I wanted to take care of
 
05:07:28.270 --> 05:07:28.280 align:start position:0%
my fellow
 
05:07:31.368 --> 05:07:31.378 align:start position:0%
Democrats and I know my Republican
 
05:07:32.990 --> 05:07:33.000 align:start position:0%
counterpart wanted to take care of his
 
05:07:35.690 --> 05:07:35.700 align:start position:0%
us not just for the local folks but
 
05:07:37.850 --> 05:07:37.860 align:start position:0%
because we had people from out of town
 
05:07:40.010 --> 05:07:40.020 align:start position:0%
from the state and for national office
 
05:07:41.750 --> 05:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
that were running and they weren't going
 
05:07:43.910 --> 05:07:43.920 align:start position:0%
to collect their signs so instead of
 
05:07:46.970 --> 05:07:46.980 align:start position:0%
taking those signs to the dump I worked
 
05:07:50.448 --> 05:07:50.458 align:start position:0%
with the uh the uh planning manager of
 
05:07:53.090 --> 05:07:53.100 align:start position:0%
the city he walked down to the public
 
05:07:54.890 --> 05:07:54.900 align:start position:0%
works department with me and we
 
05:07:58.730 --> 05:07:58.740 align:start position:0%
collected all the signs so that's that's
 
05:08:01.368 --> 05:08:01.378 align:start position:0%
it in a nutshell and I'm recommending
 
05:08:03.948 --> 05:08:03.958 align:start position:0%
that you ought to pass this bill so we
 
05:08:07.190 --> 05:08:07.200 align:start position:0%
can not run into this problem again
 
05:08:08.750 --> 05:08:08.760 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you we have any
 
05:08:08.760 --> 05:08:11.810 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you we have any
questions

05:08:11.810 --> 05:08:11.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:14.750 --> 05:08:14.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank you and just a comment I mean
 
05:08:16.970 --> 05:08:16.980 align:start position:0%
in the past in my town if they're
 
05:08:19.448 --> 05:08:19.458 align:start position:0%
collected or gone to the Londonderry
 
05:08:23.150 --> 05:08:23.160 align:start position:0%
Public Works I mean not the pub the dot
 
05:08:25.788 --> 05:08:25.798 align:start position:0%
and just picked up all the signs that I
 
05:08:28.730 --> 05:08:28.740 align:start position:0%
wanted so it's yeah but yeah a good
 
05:08:31.670 --> 05:08:31.680 align:start position:0%
point that we're changing alone
 
05:08:33.530 --> 05:08:33.540 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:08:36.288 --> 05:08:36.298 align:start position:0%
and nobody else is here and this was a
 
05:08:37.190 --> 05:08:37.200 align:start position:0%
five minute
 
05:08:41.510 --> 05:08:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:45.310 --> 05:08:45.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:49.190 --> 05:08:49.200 align:start position:0%
and no more pink cards and
 
05:08:53.750 --> 05:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:53.760 --> 05:08:55.208 align:start position:0%
 
what

05:08:55.208 --> 05:08:55.218 align:start position:0%
what
 
05:08:58.850 --> 05:08:58.860 align:start position:0%
oh you turn in a pink card
 
05:09:02.090 --> 05:09:02.100 align:start position:0%
I don't yeah I did okay
 
05:09:04.448 --> 05:09:04.458 align:start position:0%
okay oh there it is I'm sorry
 
05:09:06.410 --> 05:09:06.420 align:start position:0%
my fault
 
05:09:09.350 --> 05:09:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:09.360 --> 05:09:13.128 align:start position:0%
 
and

05:09:13.128 --> 05:09:13.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:15.410 --> 05:09:15.420 align:start position:0%
we have
 
05:09:18.410 --> 05:09:18.420 align:start position:0%
two people for it
 
05:09:21.948 --> 05:09:21.958 align:start position:0%
okay and with that
 
05:09:25.690 --> 05:09:25.700 align:start position:0%
and close the hearing on
 
05:09:29.448 --> 05:09:29.458 align:start position:0%
286 and what's that
 
05:09:33.288 --> 05:09:33.298 align:start position:0%
unless every anybody has any comments we
 
05:09:37.010 --> 05:09:37.020 align:start position:0%
can probably adjourn
