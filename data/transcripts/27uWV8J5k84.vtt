72 uh extending the commission to study
 
00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 align:start position:0%
tellah Health Services is is very short
 
00:03:19.149 --> 00:03:19.159 align:start position:0%
very easy to wrap our head around if if
 
00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 align:start position:0%
you if you look with me on um the page
 
00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 align:start position:0%
with all the writing uh I'd encourage
 
00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 align:start position:0%
you to start at line
 
00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 align:start position:0%
14 basically what we're doing with this
 
00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 align:start position:0%
bill this is a study group that uh whose
 
00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 align:start position:0%
time has come and gone it's expired and
 
00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 align:start position:0%
we've published our final
 
00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 align:start position:0%
report uh as we were coming to a
 
00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 align:start position:0%
conclusion we started to talk about uh
 
00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 align:start position:0%
whether coming to an end was U the right
 
00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 align:start position:0%
thing to do and uh it was a strong uh
 
00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 align:start position:0%
belief of the of that committee that we
 
00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 align:start position:0%
should just do one more report a
 
00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:01.799 align:start position:0%
supplemental report report uh why would
 
00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000 align:start position:0%
a supplemental report um be a reasonable
 
00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840 align:start position:0%
thing to invest in uh it's uh because
 
00:04:11.869 --> 00:04:11.879 align:start position:0%
the final data that we used to do the
 
00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:12.949 align:start position:0%
the final data that we used to do the
final

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 align:start position:0%
final
 
00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 align:start position:0%
report um was heavily influenced by
 
00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:21.680 align:start position:0%
covid and co uh we concluded really had
 
00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 align:start position:0%
an impact on the way in which T medicine
 
00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 align:start position:0%
was used an original purpose of the
 
00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 align:start position:0%
committee was to determine uh what the
 
00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 align:start position:0%
natural normal Trends are these days
 
00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 align:start position:0%
with tele medicine and to help determine
 
00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 align:start position:0%
whether or not there were things that
 
00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 align:start position:0%
could be done to encourage its its uh uh
 
00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:45.520 align:start position:0%
acceptance and and growth under under
 
00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 align:start position:0%
the belief that uh it's a vital tool in
 
00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:53.240 align:start position:0%
improving um the tripod of uh access
 
00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:55.639 align:start position:0%
cost and quality and because we think
 
00:04:58.029 --> 00:04:58.039 align:start position:0%
it's an important emerging thing and
 
00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:00.880 align:start position:0%
because we think we had uh skewed data
 
00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:04.479 align:start position:0%
from covid we wanted to U let it run
 
00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:06.560 align:start position:0%
another couple of years so that we could
 
00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 align:start position:0%
get um status quo data uh and include it
 
00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520 align:start position:0%
in the supplemental
 
00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:17.320 align:start position:0%
report now if you jump up to line 8 uh
 
00:05:20.029 --> 00:05:20.039 align:start position:0%
we determined that the original charter
 
00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:24.400 align:start position:0%
of the of the um committee was just a
 
00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:26.639 align:start position:0%
little incomplete and would have been
 
00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:30.400 align:start position:0%
better had we also taken a look at at uh
 
00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:32.919 align:start position:0%
Federal policies explicitly look at the
 
00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:35.680 align:start position:0%
federal policies to see what the trends
 
00:05:38.309 --> 00:05:38.319 align:start position:0%
were there to um uh
 
00:05:41.309 --> 00:05:41.319 align:start position:0%
encourage uh or maybe discourage tele
 
00:05:43.309 --> 00:05:43.319 align:start position:0%
medicine that's entirely possible but we
 
00:05:46.309 --> 00:05:46.319 align:start position:0%
didn't look at the federal policy issues
 
00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:49.080 align:start position:0%
and then um there was no Charter for the
 
00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:52.120 align:start position:0%
committee to potentially recommend any
 
00:05:54.189 --> 00:05:54.199 align:start position:0%
legislation not that there is
 
00:05:56.189 --> 00:05:56.199 align:start position:0%
legislation we'd recommend but we just
 
00:05:58.710 --> 00:05:58.720 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure that the the members
 
00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:00.520 align:start position:0%
of the committee knew knew that uh that
 
00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:03.039 align:start position:0%
was a possibility if we saw something
 
00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:06.360 align:start position:0%
that was worthwhile so um so that's what
 
00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:12.200 align:start position:0%
that was worthwhile so um so that's what
hb720

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:12.210 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:30.230 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:34.120 align:start position:0%
so that that's the bill um Dr Palmer
 
00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:35.720 align:start position:0%
representative Palmer is on that
 
00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:38.120 align:start position:0%
committee too uh and he was but part of
 
00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:40.240 align:start position:0%
these recommendations I think I think
 
00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:43.720 align:start position:0%
he's a co-sponsor yes he's a co-sponsor
 
00:06:46.309 --> 00:06:46.319 align:start position:0%
so you when after I leave you got people
 
00:06:49.309 --> 00:06:49.319 align:start position:0%
to ask okay what do you really think and
 
00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:51.440 align:start position:0%
so uh I'll take questions if there are
 
00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:54.960 align:start position:0%
any Mr chair sure uh representative
 
00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:57.440 align:start position:0%
Woods thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:07:00.189 --> 00:07:00.199 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um
 
00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:02.240 align:start position:0%
I've been involved with tah Health here
 
00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:04.280 align:start position:0%
in the state for probably the better
 
00:07:08.469 --> 00:07:08.479 align:start position:0%
part of 30 years right um and um my
 
00:07:11.629 --> 00:07:11.639 align:start position:0%
question is um is there was there any
 
00:07:13.909 --> 00:07:13.919 align:start position:0%
consideration to making this a continued
 
00:07:16.189 --> 00:07:16.199 align:start position:0%
committee because judging from at least
 
00:07:18.469 --> 00:07:18.479 align:start position:0%
from what I continue to read and my
 
00:07:20.869 --> 00:07:20.879 align:start position:0%
interaction with some of the or national
 
00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:22.840 align:start position:0%
organizations about the time you finish
 
00:07:24.869 --> 00:07:24.879 align:start position:0%
this report is going to be time for
 
00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:27.840 align:start position:0%
another report uh things are changing so
 
00:07:30.589 --> 00:07:30.599 align:start position:0%
fast especially with AI uh it's it's
 
00:07:32.469 --> 00:07:32.479 align:start position:0%
integration U the American Medical
 
00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:36.160 align:start position:0%
Association uh is is a big player in
 
00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:38.440 align:start position:0%
this Arena uh a number of independent
 
00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:42.440 align:start position:0%
organizations are really uh being big
 
00:07:46.469 --> 00:07:46.479 align:start position:0%
players uh and I'm just curious um it it
 
00:07:49.149 --> 00:07:49.159 align:start position:0%
seems like this would be uh something
 
00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:51.560 align:start position:0%
that would best be served with almost a
 
00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
standing committee at the risk
 
00:07:57.149 --> 00:07:57.159 align:start position:0%
of bring another committee but was there
 
00:07:59.149 --> 00:07:59.159 align:start position:0%
any consideration uh thank you for the
 
00:08:02.589 --> 00:08:02.599 align:start position:0%
question I I think the uh it wasn't an
 
00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:05.000 align:start position:0%
explicit consideration what we were
 
00:08:07.149 --> 00:08:07.159 align:start position:0%
looking at was this particular committee
 
00:08:10.029 --> 00:08:10.039 align:start position:0%
was was was terminated at the end of the
 
00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:12.720 align:start position:0%
final report and we we thought that we
 
00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:16.840 align:start position:0%
really weren't done uh I I I agree with
 
00:08:19.749 --> 00:08:19.759 align:start position:0%
your long-term Vision I I first got into
 
00:08:22.189 --> 00:08:22.199 align:start position:0%
tele medicine believe it or not in the
 
00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:24.840 align:start position:0%
60s at the University of Nebraska with
 
00:08:26.909 --> 00:08:26.919 align:start position:0%
their program when I was just a kid and
 
00:08:29.869 --> 00:08:29.879 align:start position:0%
I was interning as a volunteer
 
00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:34.000 align:start position:0%
um and then is a a DOD tele medicine
 
00:08:38.149 --> 00:08:38.159 align:start position:0%
test bed deputy director in the 80s so I
 
00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:41.200 align:start position:0%
I I believe as you seem to the the
 
00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:43.360 align:start position:0%
potential for virtualizing the Health
 
00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:45.760 align:start position:0%
Care system and and tele medicine is
 
00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:48.360 align:start position:0%
going to be maybe the backbone of that
 
00:08:50.829 --> 00:08:50.839 align:start position:0%
and then over time we'll be able to add
 
00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:52.680 align:start position:0%
other components like we're going to
 
00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:54.880 align:start position:0%
continue to add the Diagnostics we're
 
00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:00.800 align:start position:0%
going to do the AI and and and so so I I
 
00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
I would like you to know that I agree
 
00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:07.160 align:start position:0%
with you and that the chart Charter that
 
00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:10.320 align:start position:0%
you're asking for can be carried over
 
00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:14.360 align:start position:0%
into um a a longer term committee the
 
00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
emerging medical Technologies committee
 
00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:20.000 align:start position:0%
which I chair uh and we're going to have
 
00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:22.320 align:start position:0%
our first meeting in February that's the
 
00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:25.800 align:start position:0%
sort of topic that um that we would like
 
00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:28.600 align:start position:0%
to include in that committee because
 
00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:30.800 align:start position:0%
there's going to be this massive
 
00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:33.240 align:start position:0%
convergence of technologies that are
 
00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:36.720 align:start position:0%
going to create potentially a new sort
 
00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:38.560 align:start position:0%
of virtual environment now because
 
00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:40.480 align:start position:0%
healthc care moves slowly that could be
 
00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:44.640 align:start position:0%
20 years you know but but I I I think I
 
00:09:48.509 --> 00:09:48.519 align:start position:0%
think your sense is right um I I I would
 
00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:51.200 align:start position:0%
recommend at this point to just keep
 
00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:54.320 align:start position:0%
this bill narrow just extend this one
 
00:09:57.470 --> 00:09:57.480 align:start position:0%
more time that'll give us time to
 
00:09:59.750 --> 00:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
synchronize it and Inter leave it with
 
00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:01.760 align:start position:0%
the emerging medical Technologies
 
00:10:04.069 --> 00:10:04.079 align:start position:0%
committee and I think your objective
 
00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:05.600 align:start position:0%
would be met that
 
00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:09.720 align:start position:0%
way follow up uh this is educational for
 
00:10:12.910 --> 00:10:12.920 align:start position:0%
me I was out of the legislature for for
 
00:10:16.069 --> 00:10:16.079 align:start position:0%
semesters we missed you uh but um the
 
00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:18.160 align:start position:0%
emerging Technologies as you know I was
 
00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:20.320 align:start position:0%
originally a physicist and I'm very
 
00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:23.200 align:start position:0%
interested in the emerging Technologies
 
00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:26.200 align:start position:0%
this is a sidebar but um is that a
 
00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:29.320 align:start position:0%
standing committee or uh we we set that
 
00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:32.920 align:start position:0%
set up for um a 5-year life not knowing
 
00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:36.120 align:start position:0%
whether or not uh touch bases with you
 
00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:39.320 align:start position:0%
yeah let's talk about it um I think the
 
00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
the the the timely aspect of this is if
 
00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:43.680 align:start position:0%
you're interested in that committee
 
00:10:46.269 --> 00:10:46.279 align:start position:0%
we're interested in having a Democrat
 
00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:50.720 align:start position:0%
added to it um we lost one to U
 
00:10:52.949 --> 00:10:52.959 align:start position:0%
retirement so you could talk to your
 
00:10:54.949 --> 00:10:54.959 align:start position:0%
leadership and I don't think it's all
 
00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:00.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:02.760 align:start position:0%
other questions representative
 
00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:06.160 align:start position:0%
McGrath thank you I was wondering if you
 
00:11:08.269 --> 00:11:08.279 align:start position:0%
could expand on what synchronization
 
00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
with federal policy does that mean that
 
00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:12.600 align:start position:0%
we would have to follow whatever the
 
00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:16.600 align:start position:0%
federal policy is so is so as you know
 
00:11:19.829 --> 00:11:19.839 align:start position:0%
um federal policy if it comes with money
 
00:11:22.069 --> 00:11:22.079 align:start position:0%
usually comes with strings and
 
00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:25.320 align:start position:0%
synchronization and that regard would be
 
00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:27.160 align:start position:0%
if we want their money we do what they
 
00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:30.920 align:start position:0%
want um Uhn organization beyond that
 
00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
though could be uh the extent to which
 
00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:37.000 align:start position:0%
they include any research or any
 
00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
findings or any recommendations I I I
 
00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:42.200 align:start position:0%
don't know what I don't know yet about
 
00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:45.320 align:start position:0%
that uh I I do know that the Department
 
00:11:49.509 --> 00:11:49.519 align:start position:0%
of Defense still has um a version of the
 
00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:53.120 align:start position:0%
uh organization I was in in the 80s uh
 
00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:56.160 align:start position:0%
that explicitly looks at these emerging
 
00:11:59.910 --> 00:11:59.920 align:start position:0%
Technologies and and uh and uh tella
 
00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:04.120 align:start position:0%
health and I intend to go visit with
 
00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:06.920 align:start position:0%
them to find out what they are doing at
 
00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:08.680 align:start position:0%
the federal level and what issues
 
00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
they're bringing in so I I want to
 
00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:13.680 align:start position:0%
create a Communication channel so some
 
00:12:15.629 --> 00:12:15.639 align:start position:0%
of it if we want their money and there
 
00:12:18.030 --> 00:12:18.040 align:start position:0%
is money then we would do it and
 
00:12:20.389 --> 00:12:20.399 align:start position:0%
otherwise it's just being informed so
 
00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:25.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:29.269 --> 00:12:29.279 align:start position:0%
future other questions
 
00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:31.120 align:start position:0%

advocacy education and support and I'm
 
00:13:41.509 --> 00:13:41.519 align:start position:0%
here today to uh speak in support of
 
00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:42.800 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
72 um during the uh time that it was
 
00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:48.240 align:start position:0%
meeting since uh
 
00:13:50.949 --> 00:13:50.959 align:start position:0%
2020 um I served as the representative
 
00:13:53.069 --> 00:13:53.079 align:start position:0%
from a nonprofit social services
 
00:13:55.790 --> 00:13:55.800 align:start position:0%
organization representing the patient P
 
00:13:59.509 --> 00:13:59.519 align:start position:0%
perspective and um was a part of that
 
00:14:01.389 --> 00:14:01.399 align:start position:0%
commission is it did a lot of good work
 
00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:04.920 align:start position:0%
and learned a lot from the data and a
 
00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:07.880 align:start position:0%
couple of things that the data showed um
 
00:14:09.949 --> 00:14:09.959 align:start position:0%
particularly when it comes to mental
 
00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
health is that um mental health
 
00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:15.040 align:start position:0%
psychotherapists and substance use
 
00:14:17.069 --> 00:14:17.079 align:start position:0%
counselors about half of their
 
00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:19.040 align:start position:0%
appointments are tella Health
 
00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:21.240 align:start position:0%
appointments and the other thing that we
 
00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:23.800 align:start position:0%
found was uh from the claims data that
 
00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:25.160 align:start position:0%
was provided by the New Hampshire
 
00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
insurance department and the Department
 
00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:30.360 align:start position:0%
of Health and Human Services was that 80
 
00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:35.320 align:start position:0%
to 90% of all claims filed for TAA
 
00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:38.040 align:start position:0%
Health were Behavioral Health
 
00:14:41.189 --> 00:14:41.199 align:start position:0%
claims um so this is particularly
 
00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:43.560 align:start position:0%
important in the mental health care
 
00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:46.160 align:start position:0%
Workforce crisis that we're facing as
 
00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:48.440 align:start position:0%
well as the access to care that we're
 
00:14:50.269 --> 00:14:50.279 align:start position:0%
facing with folks who may not have
 
00:14:52.269 --> 00:14:52.279 align:start position:0%
transportation they may live in rural
 
00:14:54.430 --> 00:14:54.440 align:start position:0%
areas where there's not a lot of uh
 
00:14:56.470 --> 00:14:56.480 align:start position:0%
providers or may have things like child
 
00:14:59.870 --> 00:14:59.880 align:start position:0%
care or work um uh
 
00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:03.160 align:start position:0%
our executive director has been going
 
00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:05.120 align:start position:0%
into uh
 
00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
places employment um Workforce companies
 
00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
um in talking with them about how they
 
00:15:14.710 --> 00:15:14.720 align:start position:0%
can use tella health for their employees
 
00:15:16.749 --> 00:15:16.759 align:start position:0%
to support them so that if they have a
 
00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:18.560 align:start position:0%
mental health appointment they can go to
 
00:15:21.870 --> 00:15:21.880 align:start position:0%
a room have that appointment and then
 
00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:23.360 align:start position:0%
carry on with their day without having
 
00:15:25.629 --> 00:15:25.639 align:start position:0%
to actually leave so tella health is
 
00:15:28.269 --> 00:15:28.279 align:start position:0%
going to be critically important um as
 
00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:30.560 align:start position:0%
we try to deal with a lot of Workforce
 
00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:33.480 align:start position:0%
challenges across the sector um and for
 
00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:35.440 align:start position:0%
those reasons um we're in support of
 
00:15:37.629 --> 00:15:37.639 align:start position:0%
this bill um we know that the work is
 
00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:39.800 align:start position:0%
not done the the commit the commission
 
00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:43.040 align:start position:0%
found that this is an evolving
 
00:15:46.110 --> 00:15:46.120 align:start position:0%
um where the the de the data is still
 
00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:48.240 align:start position:0%
evolving on this um and we are just
 
00:15:50.189 --> 00:15:50.199 align:start position:0%
coming down from covid and seeing where
 
00:15:52.269 --> 00:15:52.279 align:start position:0%
it's going to all shake out so for those
 
00:15:53.910 --> 00:15:53.920 align:start position:0%
reasons we are in support of this bill
 
00:15:55.350 --> 00:15:55.360 align:start position:0%
and I will take any questions if you
 
00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:10.749 --> 00:16:10.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:13.269 --> 00:16:13.279 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is
 
00:16:15.150 --> 00:16:15.160 align:start position:0%
representative William Palmer a member
 
00:16:17.189 --> 00:16:17.199 align:start position:0%
of our committee and a co-sponsor of
 
00:16:17.199 --> 00:16:25.230 align:start position:0%
of our committee and a co-sponsor of
this

00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:25.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:27.720 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you Mr chair I just wanted to
 
00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:29.680 align:start position:0%
take a minute to say that I been going
 
00:16:32.829 --> 00:16:32.839 align:start position:0%
around to various places specifically
 
00:16:36.509 --> 00:16:36.519 align:start position:0%
medical um staff at Valley Regional and
 
00:16:39.309 --> 00:16:39.319 align:start position:0%
my Hospital Mount es cutney and talking
 
00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:42.720 align:start position:0%
to them about how important um this area
 
00:16:46.269 --> 00:16:46.279 align:start position:0%
is to me is to them and they are now
 
00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:48.600 align:start position:0%
regarding it as sort of a critical piece
 
00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
of primary care access and that and
 
00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
their biggest concerns are that um that
 
00:16:58.629 --> 00:16:58.639 align:start position:0%
some of the agencies like Medicare has
 
00:17:00.269 --> 00:17:00.279 align:start position:0%
been they've been talking about whether
 
00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:04.640 align:start position:0%
they continue to pay for it and um so
 
00:17:07.390 --> 00:17:07.400 align:start position:0%
that's part so I think continuing to
 
00:17:08.990 --> 00:17:09.000 align:start position:0%
study this and figure out how all these
 
00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:11.160 align:start position:0%
pieces go together is critical which is
 
00:17:14.789 --> 00:17:14.799 align:start position:0%
why I'm really in support of this bill I
 
00:17:15.870 --> 00:17:15.880 align:start position:0%
don't really have anything more to say
 
00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:17.640 align:start position:0%
to that except that there's a you know
 
00:17:19.949 --> 00:17:19.959 align:start position:0%
broad support from the medical community
 
00:17:22.510 --> 00:17:22.520 align:start position:0%
and given the lack of primary care
 
00:17:23.949 --> 00:17:23.959 align:start position:0%
access in New Hampshire pretty much
 
00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:26.520 align:start position:0%
anything we can do to improve that is
 
00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:29.080 align:start position:0%
key so I'll take any questions if
 
00:17:31.710 --> 00:17:31.720 align:start position:0%
anybody has any any
 
00:17:34.669 --> 00:17:34.679 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative
 
00:17:37.029 --> 00:17:37.039 align:start position:0%
mlan yes thank you Mr chair and and
 
00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:38.160 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Palmer for
 
00:17:40.669 --> 00:17:40.679 align:start position:0%
taking my question so you mentioned that
 
00:17:42.909 --> 00:17:42.919 align:start position:0%
some of the the funding and coverage
 
00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
might be under threat um I thought you
 
00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:48.600 align:start position:0%
said Medicaid um is hearing the same
 
00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:50.160 align:start position:0%
thing from private insurance and others
 
00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:52.720 align:start position:0%
as well it it's it's sort of an ongoing
 
00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:54.880 align:start position:0%
thing and right right now I know s of
 
00:17:56.390 --> 00:17:56.400 align:start position:0%
the American College of Physicians is
 
00:17:58.830 --> 00:17:58.840 align:start position:0%
doing a lot of lobbying to maintain
 
00:17:59.909 --> 00:17:59.919 align:start position:0%
coverage and some of it's not that
 
00:18:01.149 --> 00:18:01.159 align:start position:0%
they're going to stop coverage
 
00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:03.960 align:start position:0%
altogether but it's you know whether it
 
00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:07.720 align:start position:0%
continues to be fully funded and for and
 
00:18:09.710 --> 00:18:09.720 align:start position:0%
for what the other areas that are
 
00:18:11.669 --> 00:18:11.679 align:start position:0%
important is for example if you're a
 
00:18:14.470 --> 00:18:14.480 align:start position:0%
physician in Vermont um and your patient
 
00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
is in New Hampshire there are a lot of
 
00:18:20.190 --> 00:18:20.200 align:start position:0%
issues like that that really are sort of
 
00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:22.320 align:start position:0%
going to be very important to to solve
 
00:18:24.909 --> 00:18:24.919 align:start position:0%
so that tele medicine really can be as
 
00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:26.400 align:start position:0%
helpful as it can be because we have a
 
00:18:29.710 --> 00:18:29.720 align:start position:0%
lot of Border everywhere and so there
 
00:18:31.549 --> 00:18:31.559 align:start position:0%
all of those issues there's
 
00:18:33.669 --> 00:18:33.679 align:start position:0%
no right now there's
 
00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:37.120 align:start position:0%
no there's no one thing that that we're
 
00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
that I'm particularly worried about but
 
00:18:40.909 --> 00:18:40.919 align:start position:0%
it's the whole spectrum of of
 
00:18:44.190 --> 00:18:44.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:47.440 align:start position:0%
services yes representative Woods thank
 
00:18:48.909 --> 00:18:48.919 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thanks for taking my
 
00:18:51.789 --> 00:18:51.799 align:start position:0%
question um as with electronic medical
 
00:18:55.230 --> 00:18:55.240 align:start position:0%
records um for the private practitioner
 
00:18:57.630 --> 00:18:57.640 align:start position:0%
there is always an ancillary financial
 
00:19:00.190 --> 00:19:00.200 align:start position:0%
burden to sell set up the software have
 
00:19:02.669 --> 00:19:02.679 align:start position:0%
somebody who could maintain it um that's
 
00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:05.360 align:start position:0%
an extra charge overhead is there a
 
00:19:08.149 --> 00:19:08.159 align:start position:0%
similar sort of number that you can put
 
00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:12.240 align:start position:0%
your thumb on about is there a similar
 
00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:15.520 align:start position:0%
overhead shall we say for you mentioned
 
00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:18.320 align:start position:0%
expanding the primary care but there's
 
00:19:20.270 --> 00:19:20.280 align:start position:0%
the downside is you have to have the
 
00:19:23.789 --> 00:19:23.799 align:start position:0%
proper environment and to create that
 
00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:26.400 align:start position:0%
what's that burden
 
00:19:28.909 --> 00:19:28.919 align:start position:0%
so I don't know the whole answer to this
 
00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:31.520 align:start position:0%
I because the the part of the answer I
 
00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:33.280 align:start position:0%
don't know is what private practitioners
 
00:19:34.909 --> 00:19:34.919 align:start position:0%
who may not be using an electronic
 
00:19:39.230 --> 00:19:39.240 align:start position:0%
medical record are doing um and how that
 
00:19:41.630 --> 00:19:41.640 align:start position:0%
might work in other words sure they can
 
00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:44.960 align:start position:0%
do it over their you know iPad or or on
 
00:19:48.909 --> 00:19:48.919 align:start position:0%
the computer but how does that fit in uh
 
00:19:52.590 --> 00:19:52.600 align:start position:0%
in a lot I didn't mean to I I use the
 
00:19:54.149 --> 00:19:54.159 align:start position:0%
electronic medical record just as an
 
00:19:57.750 --> 00:19:57.760 align:start position:0%
example but as a standalone so so the
 
00:20:00.710 --> 00:20:00.720 align:start position:0%
practices that mount scotney and the and
 
00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:02.760 align:start position:0%
a lot of the so a lot of the so
 
00:20:04.789 --> 00:20:04.799 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth Hitchcock Health has a whole
 
00:20:06.669 --> 00:20:06.679 align:start position:0%
sort of system built into their
 
00:20:08.230 --> 00:20:08.240 align:start position:0%
electronic medical record which must
 
00:20:10.549 --> 00:20:10.559 align:start position:0%
have taken something and there's and
 
00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
there is a whole thing that you have to
 
00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:14.480 align:start position:0%
follow where you have to document that
 
00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:16.720 align:start position:0%
this is a tella Health visit and so
 
00:20:18.830 --> 00:20:18.840 align:start position:0%
there's extra extra time if you look at
 
00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:20.760 align:start position:0%
these notes half the note is sort of
 
00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:23.440 align:start position:0%
documentation of the so there is there
 
00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:26.080 align:start position:0%
is some extra burden there but you know
 
00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:30.840 align:start position:0%
overall that the practitioners are like
 
00:20:33.710 --> 00:20:33.720 align:start position:0%
may maybe so but it's still really uh an
 
00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:35.230 align:start position:0%
may maybe so but it's still really uh an
important

00:20:35.230 --> 00:20:35.240 align:start position:0%
important
 
00:20:38.990 --> 00:20:39.000 align:start position:0%
yeah representative Weber I I had just a
 
00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:41.080 align:start position:0%
point of order Mr chairman isn't it true
 
00:20:43.029 --> 00:20:43.039 align:start position:0%
that we have a relatively short period
 
00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:45.280 align:start position:0%
of time to deal with the bill and the
 
00:20:48.350 --> 00:20:48.360 align:start position:0%
bill is about a study committee to study
 
00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:52.480 align:start position:0%
these issues so I'm I'm wondering if we
 
00:20:55.669 --> 00:20:55.679 align:start position:0%
should try and limit our questioning to
 
00:20:57.750 --> 00:20:57.760 align:start position:0%
the study committee rather than the
 
00:20:59.510 --> 00:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
underlying issues that all of us are
 
00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:03.000 align:start position:0%
really very very interested in cuz so
 
00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:04.490 align:start position:0%
please come to the study
 
00:21:04.490 --> 00:21:06.789 align:start position:0%
please come to the study
[Laughter]

00:21:06.789 --> 00:21:06.799 align:start position:0%

uh which establishes a committee to
 
00:32:22.389 --> 00:32:22.399 align:start position:0%
study legislative protections and
 
00:32:24.669 --> 00:32:24.679 align:start position:0%
accommodations for individuals with long
 
00:32:27.430 --> 00:32:27.440 align:start position:0%
covid is a good idea for several reasons
 
00:32:29.350 --> 00:32:29.360 align:start position:0%
particular ularly when considering the
 
00:32:33.549 --> 00:32:33.559 align:start position:0%
economic impact referenced in the New
 
00:32:36.789 --> 00:32:36.799 align:start position:0%
Hampshire fiscal policy Institute report
 
00:32:39.149 --> 00:32:39.159 align:start position:0%
which you have all been mailed long
 
00:32:41.230 --> 00:32:41.240 align:start position:0%
covid is defined as a chronic condition
 
00:32:44.230 --> 00:32:44.240 align:start position:0%
that occurs after SARS covid infection
 
00:32:46.590 --> 00:32:46.600 align:start position:0%
and is present for at least three months
 
00:32:48.789 --> 00:32:48.799 align:start position:0%
long Co includes a wide range of
 
00:32:51.149 --> 00:32:51.159 align:start position:0%
symptoms or conditions that may improve
 
00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
worsen or be ongoing anyone can get long
 
00:32:58.350 --> 00:32:58.360 align:start position:0%
Co long Co occurs more of often in
 
00:33:01.350 --> 00:33:01.360 align:start position:0%
people who have had severe covid illness
 
00:33:04.230 --> 00:33:04.240 align:start position:0%
but often who get uh but anyone who gets
 
00:33:07.350 --> 00:33:07.360 align:start position:0%
uh covid can experience it including
 
00:33:09.710 --> 00:33:09.720 align:start position:0%
children most people with long covid
 
00:33:11.470 --> 00:33:11.480 align:start position:0%
experience symptoms days after first
 
00:33:13.950 --> 00:33:13.960 align:start position:0%
learning they had covid but some people
 
00:33:16.149 --> 00:33:16.159 align:start position:0%
who later develop long covid do not know
 
00:33:17.190 --> 00:33:17.200 align:start position:0%
when they were
 
00:33:19.950 --> 00:33:19.960 align:start position:0%
infected people can be reinfected with
 
00:33:22.350 --> 00:33:22.360 align:start position:0%
covid multiple times each time a person
 
00:33:24.950 --> 00:33:24.960 align:start position:0%
is infected with covid they risk they
 
00:33:26.750 --> 00:33:26.760 align:start position:0%
they have a risk of developing long
 
00:33:29.509 --> 00:33:29.519 align:start position:0%
covid long covid symptoms and conditions
 
00:33:32.909 --> 00:33:32.919 align:start position:0%
can emerge persist Revol resolve and
 
00:33:35.629 --> 00:33:35.639 align:start position:0%
reemerge over weeks and months these
 
00:33:37.669 --> 00:33:37.679 align:start position:0%
symptoms and conditions can range from
 
00:33:40.990 --> 00:33:41.000 align:start position:0%
mild to severe may require comprehensive
 
00:33:43.909 --> 00:33:43.919 align:start position:0%
care and can even result in a
 
00:33:46.430 --> 00:33:46.440 align:start position:0%
disability while rates of new cases of
 
00:33:48.549 --> 00:33:48.559 align:start position:0%
long covid have decreased since the
 
00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:51.480 align:start position:0%
beginning of covid it remains a serious
 
00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:54.240 align:start position:0%
Public Health concern as millions of us
 
00:33:56.710 --> 00:33:56.720 align:start position:0%
adults and children have been
 
00:33:59.710 --> 00:33:59.720 align:start position:0%
affected the report the New Hampshire
 
00:34:02.389 --> 00:34:02.399 align:start position:0%
report highlights that almost
 
00:34:06.029 --> 00:34:06.039 align:start position:0%
177% roughly 4,000 people of the state's
 
00:34:08.510 --> 00:34:08.520 align:start position:0%
working age population have experienced
 
00:34:11.790 --> 00:34:11.800 align:start position:0%
long Co this significant percent

percentage demonstrates the potential
 
00:34:16.950 --> 00:34:16.960 align:start position:0%
for long-term economic disruptions
 
00:34:19.589 --> 00:34:19.599 align:start position:0%
including individuals with long covid
 
00:34:22.270 --> 00:34:22.280 align:start position:0%
who often experience dis uh debilitating
 
00:34:24.069 --> 00:34:24.079 align:start position:0%
symptoms making it difficult or
 
00:34:26.230 --> 00:34:26.240 align:start position:0%
impossible to maintain consistent
 
00:34:28.510 --> 00:34:28.520 align:start position:0%
employment this effect overall
 
00:34:31.069 --> 00:34:31.079 align:start position:0%
productivity and increases dependency on
 
00:34:31.079 --> 00:34:32.510 align:start position:0%

disability
 
00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
benefits also many affected individuals
 
00:34:37.790 --> 00:34:37.800 align:start position:0%
face prolonged unemployment or
 
00:34:39.909 --> 00:34:39.919 align:start position:0%
underemployment which leads to reduced
 
00:34:42.430 --> 00:34:42.440 align:start position:0%
household income and decreases consumer
 
00:34:45.030 --> 00:34:45.040 align:start position:0%
spending which also affects the broader
 
00:34:47.710 --> 00:34:47.720 align:start position:0%
economy long covid leads to ongoing
 
00:34:49.710 --> 00:34:49.720 align:start position:0%
medical expenses including treat
 
00:34:51.869 --> 00:34:51.879 align:start position:0%
treatments diagnostic tests and
 
00:34:54.909 --> 00:34:54.919 align:start position:0%
rehabilitation services for individuals
 
00:34:56.589 --> 00:34:56.599 align:start position:0%
and families those costs can be
 
00:34:58.710 --> 00:34:58.720 align:start position:0%
devastating especially for those without
 
00:35:02.550 --> 00:35:02.560 align:start position:0%
adequate Insurance on a systemic level
 
00:35:04.710 --> 00:35:04.720 align:start position:0%

00:35:10.310 --> 00:35:10.320 align:start position:0%
Resources this bill wisely acknowledges
 
00:35:12.349 --> 00:35:12.359 align:start position:0%
that long covid disproportionately
 
00:35:15.069 --> 00:35:15.079 align:start position:0%
affects marginalized communities which
 
00:35:16.910 --> 00:35:16.920 align:start position:0%
are more more likely to work in
 
00:35:19.829 --> 00:35:19.839 align:start position:0%
high-risk low low-paying jobs without
 
00:35:22.349 --> 00:35:22.359 align:start position:0%
adequate health benefits and they also

financial safety
 
00:35:29.150 --> 00:35:29.160 align:start position:0%
nets targeted legis efforts would reduce
 
00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:32.240 align:start position:0%
those inequalities by improving access
 
00:35:34.310 --> 00:35:34.320 align:start position:0%

long-term economic and social disruption
 
00:35:49.430 --> 00:35:49.440 align:start position:0%
coordinated efforts are essential to
 
00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:52.560 align:start position:0%
address the interconnected challenges po
 
00:35:55.510 --> 00:35:55.520 align:start position:0%
posed by long covid such as ensuring

covid Demands a proactive approach
 
00:36:07.870 --> 00:36:07.880 align:start position:0%
establishing a dedicated committee
 
00:36:10.030 --> 00:36:10.040 align:start position:0%
ensures the state can respond to new

long-term economic impacts of long covid
 
00:36:24.910 --> 00:36:24.920 align:start position:0%
on individuals families and the state
 
00:36:27.069 --> 00:36:27.079 align:start position:0%
this bill represents a forward-thinking
 
00:36:30.150 --> 00:36:30.160 align:start position:0%
approach to addressing a pressing issue
 
00:36:32.069 --> 00:36:32.079 align:start position:0%
the committee's work will help mitigate
 
00:36:35.670 --> 00:36:35.680 align:start position:0%
economic losses reduce disparities and
 
00:36:37.870 --> 00:36:37.880 align:start position:0%
promote resilience within the workforce
 
00:36:40.349 --> 00:36:40.359 align:start position:0%
and Health Care Systems thank you and
 
00:36:41.870 --> 00:36:41.880 align:start position:0%
I'll take any
 
00:36:45.990 --> 00:36:46.000 align:start position:0%
questions thank you any
 
00:36:48.950 --> 00:36:48.960 align:start position:0%
questions oh I'm sorry representative
 
00:36:51.190 --> 00:36:51.200 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
00:36:54.550 --> 00:36:54.560 align:start position:0%
you very much for taking my question um
 
00:36:58.510 --> 00:36:58.520 align:start position:0%
I may have misheard you um but in one
 
00:37:04.030 --> 00:37:04.040 align:start position:0%
point in your um introduction you said
 
00:37:08.589 --> 00:37:08.599 align:start position:0%
about 7 about 4,000 people were affected
 
00:37:10.589 --> 00:37:10.599 align:start position:0%
with long covid and then you said that
 
00:37:12.670 --> 00:37:12.680 align:start position:0%
was 177% of our
 
00:37:14.910 --> 00:37:14.920 align:start position:0%
Workforce and those numbers don't seem
 
00:37:17.470 --> 00:37:17.480 align:start position:0%
to add up to me particularly well
 
00:37:20.150 --> 00:37:20.160 align:start position:0%
because that would imply a Workforce of
 
00:37:25.230 --> 00:37:25.240 align:start position:0%
about 25,000 people
 
00:37:29.030 --> 00:37:29.040 align:start position:0%
uh I I I think the 17 14% actually
 
00:37:31.150 --> 00:37:31.160 align:start position:0%
you're you're correct referred to the
 
00:37:33.470 --> 00:37:33.480 align:start position:0%
22,400 people in the report that have
 
00:37:36.109 --> 00:37:36.119 align:start position:0%
reported long Co okay they are not
 
00:37:38.190 --> 00:37:38.200 align:start position:0%
necessarily out of work 4,000 are out of
 
00:37:39.349 --> 00:37:39.359 align:start position:0%
work but
 
00:37:44.030 --> 00:37:44.040 align:start position:0%
22,400 so so it was it was that was an
 
00:37:46.829 --> 00:37:46.839 align:start position:0%
error on my part yes thank you so so the
 
00:37:49.750 --> 00:37:49.760 align:start position:0%
22,400 is New Hampshire right correct
 
00:37:52.069 --> 00:37:52.079 align:start position:0%
this is strictly on New Hampshire and is
 
00:37:54.829 --> 00:37:54.839 align:start position:0%
a followup a followup so it's 4,000 out
 
00:37:58.550 --> 00:37:58.560 align:start position:0%
of work and 22,000 some who have
 
00:38:00.829 --> 00:38:00.839 align:start position:0%
experienced it correct okay got it thank
 
00:38:03.109 --> 00:38:03.119 align:start position:0%
correct thank you representative I'm
 
00:38:03.990 --> 00:38:04.000 align:start position:0%
representative woods and then
 
00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:05.150 align:start position:0%
representative woods and then
representative

00:38:05.150 --> 00:38:05.160 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:38:07.790 --> 00:38:07.800 align:start position:0%
Maser uh thank you Mr chair and thanks
 
00:38:10.829 --> 00:38:10.839 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um being in the
 
00:38:13.309 --> 00:38:13.319 align:start position:0%
medical community I certainly this is a
 
00:38:16.069 --> 00:38:16.079 align:start position:0%
a very admirable project but how does it
 
00:38:19.190 --> 00:38:19.200 align:start position:0%
differ from any other chronic disease
 
00:38:23.550 --> 00:38:23.560 align:start position:0%
that we face and the similar kind of uh
 
00:38:25.710 --> 00:38:25.720 align:start position:0%
uh factors uh that come into play in
 
00:38:28.390 --> 00:38:28.400 align:start position:0%
terms of the workforce etc etc that
 
00:38:31.150 --> 00:38:31.160 align:start position:0%
you've outlined how is it how does this
 
00:38:33.430 --> 00:38:33.440 align:start position:0%
specifically different that would
 
00:38:36.349 --> 00:38:36.359 align:start position:0%
warrant a a specific committee for this
 
00:38:40.109 --> 00:38:40.119 align:start position:0%
particular specific medical entity thank
 
00:38:41.589 --> 00:38:41.599 align:start position:0%
you for the question and that's a that's
 
00:38:43.990 --> 00:38:44.000 align:start position:0%
a very good question um the reason that
 
00:38:46.190 --> 00:38:46.200 align:start position:0%
I I believe that this committee should
 
00:38:49.870 --> 00:38:49.880 align:start position:0%
be set up is because we're seeing viral
 
00:38:51.829 --> 00:38:51.839 align:start position:0%
infections that we haven't seen before
 
00:38:54.550 --> 00:38:54.560 align:start position:0%
like Co you know it's it's not just the
 
00:38:58.230 --> 00:38:58.240 align:start position:0%
flu this is ongoing it's mutating um and
 
00:38:59.950 --> 00:38:59.960 align:start position:0%
perhaps this should be changed from long
 
00:39:03.230 --> 00:39:03.240 align:start position:0%
covid to post viral symptom uh disease
 
00:39:04.950 --> 00:39:04.960 align:start position:0%
because there's so many out there bird
 
00:39:07.030 --> 00:39:07.040 align:start position:0%
flu is on its way you know we're going
 
00:39:09.109 --> 00:39:09.119 align:start position:0%
to have to prepare and we're going to
 
00:39:11.870 --> 00:39:11.880 align:start position:0%
have to recognize that there are many
 
00:39:13.950 --> 00:39:13.960 align:start position:0%
individuals myself included have
 
00:39:17.190 --> 00:39:17.200 align:start position:0%
postviral symptomss that are
 
00:39:20.870 --> 00:39:20.880 align:start position:0%
ongoing so it's a valid point that there
 
00:39:23.190 --> 00:39:23.200 align:start position:0%
are many many diseases out there but
 
00:39:25.829 --> 00:39:25.839 align:start position:0%
this is one that is specifically hitting
 
00:39:28.190 --> 00:39:28.200 align:start position:0%
our economy great
 
00:39:30.710 --> 00:39:30.720 align:start position:0%
and we need to we need to address
 
00:39:33.950 --> 00:39:33.960 align:start position:0%
it representative merer yes thank you
 
00:39:35.550 --> 00:39:35.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:39:39.109 --> 00:39:39.119 align:start position:0%
my question um kind of off of what
 
00:39:41.270 --> 00:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
representative wood said but so how do
 
00:39:44.309 --> 00:39:44.319 align:start position:0%
we know that these long-term effects of
 
00:39:46.309 --> 00:39:46.319 align:start position:0%
long are they long-term effects of long
 
00:39:47.910 --> 00:39:47.920 align:start position:0%
covid how do we know that they're not
 
00:39:49.750 --> 00:39:49.760 align:start position:0%
long-term effects of the actual covid
 
00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:59.790 align:start position:0%
long-term effects of the actual covid
vaccine

00:39:59.790 --> 00:39:59.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:02.829 --> 00:40:02.839 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure how to address that however
 
00:40:05.990 --> 00:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
if you have long-term effects from the
 
00:40:09.030 --> 00:40:09.040 align:start position:0%
vaccine if you believe you do that would
 
00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:10.990 align:start position:0%
vaccine if you believe you do that would
be

00:40:10.990 --> 00:40:11.000 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:40:13.430 --> 00:40:13.440 align:start position:0%
um I would think it would fall under the
 
00:40:16.470 --> 00:40:16.480 align:start position:0%
umbrella of this long-term effects from
 
00:40:20.069 --> 00:40:20.079 align:start position:0%
covid whether it be the vaccine or or
 
00:40:22.309 --> 00:40:22.319 align:start position:0%
the actual viral
 
00:40:25.630 --> 00:40:25.640 align:start position:0%
inection follow so I I read the report
 
00:40:28.710 --> 00:40:28.720 align:start position:0%
and it does mention the UN un vaccinated
 
00:40:32.109 --> 00:40:32.119 align:start position:0%
um so are the vaccinated going to be
 
00:40:38.349 --> 00:40:38.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:42.390 --> 00:40:42.400 align:start position:0%
well if you suffer from postviral
 
00:40:46.109 --> 00:40:46.119 align:start position:0%
symptomss from a covid infection I would
 
00:40:49.829 --> 00:40:49.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:51.710 --> 00:40:51.720 align:start position:0%
study other
 
00:40:55.030 --> 00:40:55.040 align:start position:0%
questions uh representative
 
00:41:00.550 --> 00:41:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:02.309 --> 00:41:02.319 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
00:41:06.950 --> 00:41:06.960 align:start position:0%
chairman we're all aware that U the
 
00:41:10.670 --> 00:41:10.680 align:start position:0%
legislative leadership is very concerned
 
00:41:14.910 --> 00:41:14.920 align:start position:0%
that we keep forming committies uh
 
00:41:18.750 --> 00:41:18.760 align:start position:0%
partly because they have to staff them U
 
00:41:21.270 --> 00:41:21.280 align:start position:0%
and I'm wondering if there's some other
 
00:41:26.150 --> 00:41:26.160 align:start position:0%
way of assisting in this issue without
 
00:41:28.109 --> 00:41:28.119 align:start position:0%
forming another
 
00:41:30.030 --> 00:41:30.040 align:start position:0%
committee because the
 
00:41:33.030 --> 00:41:33.040 align:start position:0%
implication is that the Public Health
 
00:41:36.910 --> 00:41:36.920 align:start position:0%
Community is not living up to their
 
00:41:39.349 --> 00:41:39.359 align:start position:0%
responsibilities and I don't think
 
00:41:41.790 --> 00:41:41.800 align:start position:0%
that's at all what what you
 
00:41:45.470 --> 00:41:45.480 align:start position:0%
intend U so that I wonder if there's
 
00:41:50.430 --> 00:41:50.440 align:start position:0%
some other way that we can help to deal
 
00:41:51.950 --> 00:41:51.960 align:start position:0%
with what is an
 
00:41:55.230 --> 00:41:55.240 align:start position:0%
important health problem without forming
 
00:41:57.950 --> 00:41:57.960 align:start position:0%
another committee
 
00:42:01.550 --> 00:42:01.560 align:start position:0%
is I I'm not sure what the question is
 
00:42:04.150 --> 00:42:04.160 align:start position:0%
the question is is there some other way
 
00:42:08.910 --> 00:42:08.920 align:start position:0%
to help the uh Public Health Community
 
00:42:12.950 --> 00:42:12.960 align:start position:0%
in their work without forming another
 
00:42:15.829 --> 00:42:15.839 align:start position:0%
committee I okay so I I understand the
 
00:42:19.390 --> 00:42:19.400 align:start position:0%
question and what I can say is that
 
00:42:21.390 --> 00:42:21.400 align:start position:0%
finding some other way to help the
 
00:42:24.670 --> 00:42:24.680 align:start position:0%
community is exactly why what this uh
 
00:42:27.829 --> 00:42:27.839 align:start position:0%
study committee is about um and and in
 
00:42:30.790 --> 00:42:30.800 align:start position:0%
our my my committee where I where I sit
 
00:42:33.390 --> 00:42:33.400 align:start position:0%
we're also warned about um having so
 
00:42:35.790 --> 00:42:35.800 align:start position:0%
many study committees however isn't it
 
00:42:39.190 --> 00:42:39.200 align:start position:0%
our job to study and to come up with
 
00:42:42.829 --> 00:42:42.839 align:start position:0%
solutions for our constituents follow up
 
00:42:46.790 --> 00:42:46.800 align:start position:0%
follow up u i I think he answered my
 
00:42:49.470 --> 00:42:49.480 align:start position:0%
question and the question is how can we
 
00:42:51.069 --> 00:42:51.079 align:start position:0%
sell that on the
 
00:42:55.069 --> 00:42:55.079 align:start position:0%
floor uh because that I agree that's a
 
00:42:57.829 --> 00:42:57.839 align:start position:0%
major problem uh
 
00:43:01.829 --> 00:43:01.839 align:start position:0%
but we need some evidence that it's not
 
00:43:01.839 --> 00:43:02.710 align:start position:0%
but we need some evidence that it's not
being

00:43:02.710 --> 00:43:02.720 align:start position:0%
being
 
00:43:06.349 --> 00:43:06.359 align:start position:0%
addressed and and how to deal with
 
00:43:08.549 --> 00:43:08.559 align:start position:0%
it representative mlan do you have your
 
00:43:10.829 --> 00:43:10.839 align:start position:0%
hand up and then representative Woods
 
00:43:12.150 --> 00:43:12.160 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chair and then
 
00:43:13.870 --> 00:43:13.880 align:start position:0%
representative pmer and thank you for
 
00:43:15.990 --> 00:43:16.000 align:start position:0%
taking my question so I'm just um I'm
 
00:43:18.069 --> 00:43:18.079 align:start position:0%
just curious as to the scope and and
 
00:43:20.069 --> 00:43:20.079 align:start position:0%
where you see the need and you know
 
00:43:22.710 --> 00:43:22.720 align:start position:0%
where you what what is the area of focus
 
00:43:25.109 --> 00:43:25.119 align:start position:0%
going to be is is the area of focus
 
00:43:28.309 --> 00:43:28.319 align:start position:0%
looking at um improving the health
 
00:43:30.750 --> 00:43:30.760 align:start position:0%
outcomes or is it more like you said
 
00:43:32.950 --> 00:43:32.960 align:start position:0%
that you you're seeing gaps in coverage
 
00:43:34.829 --> 00:43:34.839 align:start position:0%
and people are out and so they're
 
00:43:37.589 --> 00:43:37.599 align:start position:0%
experiencing financial hardship so
 
00:43:39.790 --> 00:43:39.800 align:start position:0%
you're really going to be focusing in on
 
00:43:42.750 --> 00:43:42.760 align:start position:0%
there that area I'm just trying to
 
00:43:45.190 --> 00:43:45.200 align:start position:0%
understand how expansive the scope is be
 
00:43:47.750 --> 00:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
and where you envision it going um sure
 
00:43:51.109 --> 00:43:51.119 align:start position:0%
if you look at uh in the in the uh
 
00:43:55.870 --> 00:43:55.880 align:start position:0%
Bill uh lines 11 through
 
00:43:59.549 --> 00:43:59.559 align:start position:0%
28 uh explained what the uh committee
 
00:44:02.230 --> 00:44:02.240 align:start position:0%
would be looking at uh specifically my
 
00:44:05.990 --> 00:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:08.910 --> 00:44:08.920 align:start position:0%
impact thank you you're welcome
 
00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:10.349 align:start position:0%
impact thank you you're welcome
representative

00:44:10.349 --> 00:44:10.359 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:44:12.710 --> 00:44:12.720 align:start position:0%
Woods thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:44:15.990 --> 00:44:16.000 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um just as um as
 
00:44:19.190 --> 00:44:19.200 align:start position:0%
you formulated this were you familiar
 
00:44:22.349 --> 00:44:22.359 align:start position:0%
with the uh long covid Clinic uh at
 
00:44:25.270 --> 00:44:25.280 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth um with I forgotten Your Name
 
00:44:29.430 --> 00:44:29.440 align:start position:0%
Escapes me uh um but um he started at
 
00:44:32.109 --> 00:44:32.119 align:start position:0%
right at the beginning of co uh did you
 
00:44:33.950 --> 00:44:33.960 align:start position:0%
work with him in terms of formulating
 
00:44:37.349 --> 00:44:37.359 align:start position:0%
any of this material um I did not um and
 
00:44:39.270 --> 00:44:39.280 align:start position:0%
I'm aware that they have a clinic up
 
00:44:40.950 --> 00:44:40.960 align:start position:0%
there and that could be part of it is to
 
00:44:42.750 --> 00:44:42.760 align:start position:0%
make more people aware that there's a
 
00:44:44.230 --> 00:44:44.240 align:start position:0%
clinic because a lot of people just
 
00:44:46.069 --> 00:44:46.079 align:start position:0%
don't know where to go I mean they're
 
00:44:48.270 --> 00:44:48.280 align:start position:0%
stuck with these symptoms and they don't
 
00:44:50.630 --> 00:44:50.640 align:start position:0%
know who can help
 
00:44:53.510 --> 00:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
them representative
 
00:44:56.430 --> 00:44:56.440 align:start position:0%
Palmer so representative Woods started
 
00:44:58.750 --> 00:44:58.760 align:start position:0%
with the exactly where I was it's uh Dr
 
00:45:00.349 --> 00:45:00.359 align:start position:0%
Parson and it is a whole inter
 
00:45:02.910 --> 00:45:02.920 align:start position:0%
interdisciplinary team that is working
 
00:45:04.510 --> 00:45:04.520 align:start position:0%
and they're they're both they're both
 
00:45:06.630 --> 00:45:06.640 align:start position:0%
available for treatment for people who
 
00:45:08.790 --> 00:45:08.800 align:start position:0%
think they have postco and they're also
 
00:45:10.829 --> 00:45:10.839 align:start position:0%
doing a lot of research and so they may
 
00:45:13.549 --> 00:45:13.559 align:start position:0%
be looking into a lot of the questions
 
00:45:17.190 --> 00:45:17.200 align:start position:0%
that this committee would look at and um
 
00:45:19.030 --> 00:45:19.040 align:start position:0%
so it might be worth I mean it's
 
00:45:21.750 --> 00:45:21.760 align:start position:0%
definitely worth talking to those guys
 
00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:22.950 align:start position:0%
definitely worth talking to those guys
thank

00:45:22.950 --> 00:45:22.960 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:45:25.950 --> 00:45:25.960 align:start position:0%
you other
 
00:45:33.510 --> 00:45:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:36.230 --> 00:45:36.240 align:start position:0%
you no one else has signed up to testify
 
00:45:40.309 --> 00:45:40.319 align:start position:0%
on HB 58 does anyone else wish to
 
00:45:42.549 --> 00:45:42.559 align:start position:0%
testify seeing no one I am going to
 
00:45:44.230 --> 00:45:44.240 align:start position:0%
close the public hearing I thought this
 
00:45:47.230 --> 00:45:47.240 align:start position:0%
might go on longer obviously uh given
 
00:45:50.510 --> 00:45:50.520 align:start position:0%
given the the nature of Co and and the
 
00:45:53.870 --> 00:45:53.880 align:start position:0%
um the interest and and the concerns and
 
00:45:56.750 --> 00:45:56.760 align:start position:0%
challenges that presented to our country
 
00:46:00.030 --> 00:46:00.040 align:start position:0%
and State uh so it's it's sometime
 
00:46:02.510 --> 00:46:02.520 align:start position:0%
sometimes hard to gauge you know
 
00:46:04.109 --> 00:46:04.119 align:start position:0%
participation in the hearing so I
 
00:46:06.109 --> 00:46:06.119 align:start position:0%
apologize for it's going to be a
 
00:46:09.030 --> 00:46:09.040 align:start position:0%
relatively long recess but um our next
 
00:46:10.750 --> 00:46:10.760 align:start position:0%
bill isn't scheduled to be heard until
 
00:46:13.910 --> 00:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
11:00 a.m. House Bill 370 so we will be
 
00:46:24.010 --> 00:46:24.020 align:start position:0%

uh read read this testimony on his
 
01:32:56.950 --> 01:32:56.960 align:start position:0%
behalf um HB 370 reestablishes a
 
01:32:59.390 --> 01:32:59.400 align:start position:0%
commission to study the delivery of
 
01:33:01.470 --> 01:33:01.480 align:start position:0%
Behavioral crisis services to
 
01:33:03.830 --> 01:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
individuals with mental illness whose
 
01:33:05.990 --> 01:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
impairment is primarily due to
 
01:33:08.669 --> 01:33:08.679 align:start position:0%
intellectual disability uh the issue
 
01:33:11.189 --> 01:33:11.199 align:start position:0%
stems from the definition of mental
 
01:33:13.470 --> 01:33:13.480 align:start position:0%
illness found in RSA
 
01:33:17.590 --> 01:33:17.600 align:start position:0%
135c colon 2x mental illness means a
 
01:33:19.510 --> 01:33:19.520 align:start position:0%
substance impairment of emotional
 
01:33:22.510 --> 01:33:22.520 align:start position:0%
processes or of the ability to exercise
 
01:33:25.310 --> 01:33:25.320 align:start position:0%
conscious control of one 's actions or
 
01:33:27.910 --> 01:33:27.920 align:start position:0%
of the ability to perceive reality or to
 
01:33:30.350 --> 01:33:30.360 align:start position:0%
reason when the impairment is manifested
 
01:33:32.590 --> 01:33:32.600 align:start position:0%
by instances of extremely abnormal
 
01:33:36.310 --> 01:33:36.320 align:start position:0%
behavior or extremely falter perceptions
 
01:33:38.910 --> 01:33:38.920 align:start position:0%
and he highlighted this next section it
 
01:33:41.510 --> 01:33:41.520 align:start position:0%
does not include impairment primarily
 
01:33:44.149 --> 01:33:44.159 align:start position:0%
caused by intellectual
 
01:33:48.510 --> 01:33:48.520 align:start position:0%
disability um so and that's that's the
 
01:33:50.550 --> 01:33:50.560 align:start position:0%
the root of the problem every year there
 
01:33:53.229 --> 01:33:53.239 align:start position:0%
are about 10 cases of individuals who
 
01:33:55.189 --> 01:33:55.199 align:start position:0%
experience a significant enough
 
01:33:57.629 --> 01:33:57.639 align:start position:0%
behavioral crisis that they are brought
 
01:34:00.709 --> 01:34:00.719 align:start position:0%
to a local hospital those hospitals
 
01:34:03.229 --> 01:34:03.239 align:start position:0%
without appropri staff and services for
 
01:34:05.390 --> 01:34:05.400 align:start position:0%
these episodes essentially just
 
01:34:07.430 --> 01:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
Warehouse the individuals without
 
01:34:10.030 --> 01:34:10.040 align:start position:0%
treatment for up to three or four weeks
 
01:34:12.510 --> 01:34:12.520 align:start position:0%
before releasing them there was
 
01:34:15.109 --> 01:34:15.119 align:start position:0%
testimony um when the committee heard
 
01:34:18.030 --> 01:34:18.040 align:start position:0%
the bill last year both pro and con on
 
01:34:19.750 --> 01:34:19.760 align:start position:0%
removing intellectual disability
 
01:34:21.709 --> 01:34:21.719 align:start position:0%
exemption from the mental illness
 
01:34:24.990 --> 01:34:25.000 align:start position:0%
definition as a solution uh to re
 
01:34:27.510 --> 01:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
redefining responsibilities within the
 
01:34:30.189 --> 01:34:30.199 align:start position:0%
system uh this committee and the Full
 
01:34:32.270 --> 01:34:32.280 align:start position:0%
House last year passed Amendment
 
01:34:35.709 --> 01:34:35.719 align:start position:0%
language on a Voice vote which when it
 
01:34:37.390 --> 01:34:37.400 align:start position:0%
went to the Senate they came back and
 
01:34:39.350 --> 01:34:39.360 align:start position:0%
they proposed a commission the house
 
01:34:41.390 --> 01:34:41.400 align:start position:0%
concurred with the other bod's Amendment
 
01:34:43.149 --> 01:34:43.159 align:start position:0%
and the governor signed a bill
 
01:34:45.870 --> 01:34:45.880 align:start position:0%
establishing the commission the purpose
 
01:34:48.030 --> 01:34:48.040 align:start position:0%
of the commission was to identify
 
01:34:49.709 --> 01:34:49.719 align:start position:0%
appropriate procedures within the mental
 
01:34:52.109 --> 01:34:52.119 align:start position:0%
health services framework to ensure
 
01:34:54.430 --> 01:34:54.440 align:start position:0%
individuals experiencing a behavioral
 
01:34:56.990 --> 01:34:57.000 align:start position:0%
crisis and whose primary impairment as
 
01:34:59.310 --> 01:34:59.320 align:start position:0%
an intellectual dis is an intellectual
 
01:35:02.350 --> 01:35:02.360 align:start position:0%
disability receive adequate And Timely
 
01:35:05.790 --> 01:35:05.800 align:start position:0%
treatment however um the appointment of
 
01:35:07.990 --> 01:35:08.000 align:start position:0%
commission members by the governor was
 
01:35:09.950 --> 01:35:09.960 align:start position:0%
considerably delayed you know we were
 
01:35:12.950 --> 01:35:12.960 align:start position:0%
into uh the middle of October and some
 
01:35:15.109 --> 01:35:15.119 align:start position:0%
members were never appointed we were
 
01:35:18.070 --> 01:35:18.080 align:start position:0%
barely able to get a quorum um I was
 
01:35:19.790 --> 01:35:19.800 align:start position:0%
asked to serve as clerk on that
 
01:35:22.990 --> 01:35:23.000 align:start position:0%
commission and the the um the HHS
 
01:35:25.390 --> 01:35:25.400 align:start position:0%
representative actually said do you even
 
01:35:28.270 --> 01:35:28.280 align:start position:0%
have enough people for a quum and it had
 
01:35:31.470 --> 01:35:31.480 align:start position:0%
just come in uh that morning and so
 
01:35:33.709 --> 01:35:33.719 align:start position:0%
given the deadline which was November
 
01:35:36.590 --> 01:35:36.600 align:start position:0%
the 1st everybody at the commission said
 
01:35:39.149 --> 01:35:39.159 align:start position:0%
we really there is no time to do the
 
01:35:42.430 --> 01:35:42.440 align:start position:0%
work we we've run out of time and so the
 
01:35:44.430 --> 01:35:44.440 align:start position:0%
the recommendation was you're going to
 
01:35:45.790 --> 01:35:45.800 align:start position:0%
have to come back you're going to have
 
01:35:48.030 --> 01:35:48.040 align:start position:0%
to reestablish the commission and so
 
01:35:49.510 --> 01:35:49.520 align:start position:0%
that's what this bill does this bill
 
01:35:51.709 --> 01:35:51.719 align:start position:0%
reestablishes the commission with an
 
01:35:53.870 --> 01:35:53.880 align:start position:0%
adequate timeline to complete the the
 
01:35:56.990 --> 01:35:57.000 align:start position:0%
task um and it was recommended uh when
 
01:36:00.470 --> 01:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
they did meet that one time that um the
 
01:36:03.229 --> 01:36:03.239 align:start position:0%
the report outdate be pushed out with an
 
01:36:05.629 --> 01:36:05.639 align:start position:0%
interim report by November of this year
 
01:36:07.709 --> 01:36:07.719 align:start position:0%
but the final report out to November
 
01:36:10.790 --> 01:36:10.800 align:start position:0%
2027 it doesn't need to take that long
 
01:36:13.189 --> 01:36:13.199 align:start position:0%
but it just prevents uh them running
 
01:36:15.030 --> 01:36:15.040 align:start position:0%
into the same problem that they
 
01:36:17.709 --> 01:36:17.719 align:start position:0%
encountered last time so that is not the
 
01:36:19.990 --> 01:36:20.000 align:start position:0%
intention but it was recommended by the
 
01:36:22.189 --> 01:36:22.199 align:start position:0%
folks on HHS maybe you should consider
 
01:36:25.510 --> 01:36:25.520 align:start position:0%
that with respect to the dates so um
 
01:36:27.270 --> 01:36:27.280 align:start position:0%
representative anardi also says that
 
01:36:29.550 --> 01:36:29.560 align:start position:0%
individuals who testified in favor of
 
01:36:32.109 --> 01:36:32.119 align:start position:0%
the bill last session were not REM
 
01:36:35.030 --> 01:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
marshaled uh obviously to Advocate uh
 
01:36:37.109 --> 01:36:37.119 align:start position:0%
for the commission and that was because
 
01:36:39.790 --> 01:36:39.800 align:start position:0%
he believed that the issue was settled
 
01:36:41.390 --> 01:36:41.400 align:start position:0%
by the creation of the Commission in the
 
01:36:43.709 --> 01:36:43.719 align:start position:0%
first place and so he was just basically
 
01:36:45.709 --> 01:36:45.719 align:start position:0%
asking now that it could be uh
 
01:36:47.550 --> 01:36:47.560 align:start position:0%
reappointed with the time to complete
 
01:36:51.310 --> 01:36:51.320 align:start position:0%
its task and um he will be available for
 
01:36:53.149 --> 01:36:53.159 align:start position:0%
questions after his testimony and
 
01:36:55.750 --> 01:36:55.760 align:start position:0%
commerce and consumer affairs um but I
 
01:36:58.070 --> 01:36:58.080 align:start position:0%
don't know how that's going to go but um
 
01:37:01.229 --> 01:37:01.239 align:start position:0%
that's basically um the the main thrust
 
01:37:04.910 --> 01:37:04.920 align:start position:0%
of his testimony and I'll do whatever I
 
01:37:08.270 --> 01:37:08.280 align:start position:0%
can to answer any questions on his
 
01:37:10.950 --> 01:37:10.960 align:start position:0%
behalf thank you so in other words the
 
01:37:12.510 --> 01:37:12.520 align:start position:0%
commission never really did function
 
01:37:14.629 --> 01:37:14.639 align:start position:0%
have a chance to do anything last time
 
01:37:17.990 --> 01:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
right so I understand it no it it just
 
01:37:20.550 --> 01:37:20.560 align:start position:0%
showed up like we we barely had a quorum
 
01:37:22.590 --> 01:37:22.600 align:start position:0%
with the last people being appointed
 
01:37:25.430 --> 01:37:25.440 align:start position:0%
that morning but then we don't we don't
 
01:37:27.430 --> 01:37:27.440 align:start position:0%
have time so the the recommendation of
 
01:37:29.189 --> 01:37:29.199 align:start position:0%
the commission was to reestablish the
 
01:37:32.189 --> 01:37:32.199 align:start position:0%
commission okay representative Nel I
 
01:37:34.310 --> 01:37:34.320 align:start position:0%
guess I'm very confused because I was on
 
01:37:36.750 --> 01:37:36.760 align:start position:0%
a commission on the Behavioral Health
 
01:37:39.589 --> 01:37:39.599 align:start position:0%
crisis Services was that the the
 
01:37:41.350 --> 01:37:41.360 align:start position:0%
commission I was
 
01:37:43.870 --> 01:37:43.880 align:start position:0%
on all right thank you because we did a
 
01:37:46.550 --> 01:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
lot and they recall almost the exact
 
01:37:48.189 --> 01:37:48.199 align:start position:0%
same thing as I'm staring at the name
 
01:37:48.199 --> 01:37:50.950 align:start position:0%
same thing as I'm staring at the name
right

01:37:50.950 --> 01:37:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:54.669 --> 01:37:54.679 align:start position:0%
here representative McKay
 
01:37:56.229 --> 01:37:56.239 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
01:38:00.669 --> 01:38:00.679 align:start position:0%
chairman uh I support this commission
 
01:38:02.750 --> 01:38:02.760 align:start position:0%
but for different
 
01:38:04.669 --> 01:38:04.679 align:start position:0%
reasons our
 
01:38:04.679 --> 01:38:06.589 align:start position:0%
reasons our
society

01:38:06.589 --> 01:38:06.599 align:start position:0%
society
 
01:38:09.229 --> 01:38:09.239 align:start position:0%
generally has a
 
01:38:12.030 --> 01:38:12.040 align:start position:0%
prejudicial approach to mental illness
 
01:38:13.390 --> 01:38:13.400 align:start position:0%
and mental
 
01:38:15.390 --> 01:38:15.400 align:start position:0%
retardation and the
 
01:38:19.270 --> 01:38:19.280 align:start position:0%
language that's in this bill is typical
 
01:38:20.589 --> 01:38:20.599 align:start position:0%
of what
 
01:38:23.990 --> 01:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
happens it is very difficult
 
01:38:26.149 --> 01:38:26.159 align:start position:0%
uh to put the two
 
01:38:29.870 --> 01:38:29.880 align:start position:0%
categories together to say that metal
 
01:38:32.270 --> 01:38:32.280 align:start position:0%
retardation is the same as mental
 
01:38:35.950 --> 01:38:35.960 align:start position:0%
illness but that's what this does uh so
 
01:38:38.750 --> 01:38:38.760 align:start position:0%
I would hope that the commission would
 
01:38:43.350 --> 01:38:43.360 align:start position:0%
look into that we understand in our
 
01:38:45.990 --> 01:38:46.000 align:start position:0%
society that there's a built-in
 
01:38:49.070 --> 01:38:49.080 align:start position:0%
prejudice against mental illness and
 
01:38:50.470 --> 01:38:50.480 align:start position:0%
that's one of the
 
01:38:53.070 --> 01:38:53.080 align:start position:0%
difficulties of individuals who want to
 
01:38:56.750 --> 01:38:56.760 align:start position:0%
treat the mentally ill uh if if the
 
01:39:00.910 --> 01:39:00.920 align:start position:0%
commission could take that on that is a
 
01:39:03.629 --> 01:39:03.639 align:start position:0%
Monumental problem in our
 
01:39:08.589 --> 01:39:08.599 align:start position:0%
society uh but I would strongly
 
01:39:12.030 --> 01:39:12.040 align:start position:0%
support looking into that or at least
 
01:39:14.990 --> 01:39:15.000 align:start position:0%
getting it out into the public that
 
01:39:18.229 --> 01:39:18.239 align:start position:0%
there is a difficulty in our society
 
01:39:21.629 --> 01:39:21.639 align:start position:0%
accepting mental illness and mental
 
01:39:24.990 --> 01:39:25.000 align:start position:0%
retardation and that affect our ability
 
01:39:28.550 --> 01:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
to fund those programs uh so here's
 
01:39:28.560 --> 01:39:29.870 align:start position:0%
to fund those programs uh so here's
another

01:39:29.870 --> 01:39:29.880 align:start position:0%
another
 
01:39:32.750 --> 01:39:32.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity uh to get that out into the
 
01:39:36.390 --> 01:39:36.400 align:start position:0%
open thank you very
 
01:39:38.589 --> 01:39:38.599 align:start position:0%
much representative
 
01:39:40.910 --> 01:39:40.920 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
01:39:44.430 --> 01:39:44.440 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question and um my
 
01:39:47.550 --> 01:39:47.560 align:start position:0%
question is very specific to the bill
 
01:39:49.510 --> 01:39:49.520 align:start position:0%
because I'm trying to dredge up my
 
01:39:53.910 --> 01:39:53.920 align:start position:0%
memories of last time around and am I
 
01:39:56.790 --> 01:39:56.800 align:start position:0%
correct in remembering that the real
 
01:40:01.350 --> 01:40:01.360 align:start position:0%
Focus here was on the subset of
 
01:40:04.750 --> 01:40:04.760 align:start position:0%
individuals who when they are taken to
 
01:40:08.310 --> 01:40:08.320 align:start position:0%
the hospital because of Behavioral in
 
01:40:08.320 --> 01:40:10.109 align:start position:0%
the hospital because of Behavioral in
behaviorally

01:40:10.109 --> 01:40:10.119 align:start position:0%
behaviorally
 
01:40:13.149 --> 01:40:13.159 align:start position:0%
inappropriate things that they have done
 
01:40:16.149 --> 01:40:16.159 align:start position:0%
they are then told that they cannot be
 
01:40:20.390 --> 01:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
treated because they as persons with
 
01:40:20.400 --> 01:40:21.830 align:start position:0%
treated because they as persons with
developmental

01:40:21.830 --> 01:40:21.840 align:start position:0%
developmental
 
01:40:24.950 --> 01:40:24.960 align:start position:0%
disabilities are specifically Exempted
 
01:40:27.589 --> 01:40:27.599 align:start position:0%
from the definition of mental illness is
 
01:40:31.470 --> 01:40:31.480 align:start position:0%
is that am I remembering that yes as the
 
01:40:33.350 --> 01:40:33.360 align:start position:0%
root of the problem yes thank you
 
01:40:34.990 --> 01:40:35.000 align:start position:0%
represent yeah that is correct so if you
 
01:40:39.750 --> 01:40:39.760 align:start position:0%
have severe autism for example um well
 
01:40:42.390 --> 01:40:42.400 align:start position:0%
that's the primary driver here and and
 
01:40:44.109 --> 01:40:44.119 align:start position:0%
so that's what's driving the behavioral
 
01:40:46.950 --> 01:40:46.960 align:start position:0%
thing so we're just not going to put you
 
01:40:48.229 --> 01:40:48.239 align:start position:0%
at New Hampshire hospital we're just
 
01:40:49.750 --> 01:40:49.760 align:start position:0%
going to Warehouse you here and
 
01:40:52.669 --> 01:40:52.679 align:start position:0%
ultimately um the symptoms are going to
 
01:40:55.310 --> 01:40:55.320 align:start position:0%
uh sub side or not and then you're going
 
01:40:57.629 --> 01:40:57.639 align:start position:0%
to go back to your home without really
 
01:40:59.910 --> 01:40:59.920 align:start position:0%
having received any treatment thank you
 
01:41:01.910 --> 01:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
and a followup followup actually I think
 
01:41:03.470 --> 01:41:03.480 align:start position:0%
that last
 
01:41:06.910 --> 01:41:06.920 align:start position:0%
phrase took care of my followup so the
 
01:41:08.629 --> 01:41:08.639 align:start position:0%
the the specific issue was for that
 
01:41:10.589 --> 01:41:10.599 align:start position:0%
these individuals they're not receiving
 
01:41:14.550 --> 01:41:14.560 align:start position:0%
any treatment at all or or certainly no
 
01:41:16.030 --> 01:41:16.040 align:start position:0%
uh treatment that is in any way
 
01:41:17.870 --> 01:41:17.880 align:start position:0%
particularly appropriate to their
 
01:41:19.950 --> 01:41:19.960 align:start position:0%
situation and I think that's why
 
01:41:21.550 --> 01:41:21.560 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi used the word
 
01:41:24.229 --> 01:41:24.239 align:start position:0%
warehousing in his testimony okay thank
 
01:41:25.990 --> 01:41:26.000 align:start position:0%
you very much for the
 
01:41:29.189 --> 01:41:29.199 align:start position:0%
explanation representative Woods thank
 
01:41:30.910 --> 01:41:30.920 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
01:41:35.550 --> 01:41:35.560 align:start position:0%
question um I'm I sort of have the same
 
01:41:38.270 --> 01:41:38.280 align:start position:0%
how the categorization and I'll use an
 
01:41:41.149 --> 01:41:41.159 align:start position:0%
example um fetal alcohol
 
01:41:44.830 --> 01:41:44.840 align:start position:0%
syndrome maybe sort of what we might
 
01:41:46.790 --> 01:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
StreetWise say that they're
 
01:41:49.470 --> 01:41:49.480 align:start position:0%
intellectually developed but their
 
01:41:49.480 --> 01:41:50.669 align:start position:0%
intellectually developed but their
decision

01:41:50.669 --> 01:41:50.679 align:start position:0%
decision
 
01:41:54.229 --> 01:41:54.239 align:start position:0%
making uh is very adherent
 
01:41:57.629 --> 01:41:57.639 align:start position:0%
um would that be some someone um and
 
01:41:59.229 --> 01:41:59.239 align:start position:0%
that that is devastating to society
 
01:42:02.070 --> 01:42:02.080 align:start position:0%
fetal alcohol syndrome uh and they can
 
01:42:05.589 --> 01:42:05.599 align:start position:0%
have straight A's some of them um but
 
01:42:07.950 --> 01:42:07.960 align:start position:0%
their frontal lobe
 
01:42:11.870 --> 01:42:11.880 align:start position:0%
capacity uh would seemingly fit is that
 
01:42:13.990 --> 01:42:14.000 align:start position:0%
am I understanding the differential
 
01:42:16.229 --> 01:42:16.239 align:start position:0%
you're trying to make um I'm I'm
 
01:42:17.669 --> 01:42:17.679 align:start position:0%
certainly not an expert and I'm
 
01:42:19.350 --> 01:42:19.360 align:start position:0%
certainly not representative Bernardi
 
01:42:21.550 --> 01:42:21.560 align:start position:0%
but I it is I I believe that that would
 
01:42:22.790 --> 01:42:22.800 align:start position:0%
be covered under what the commission
 
01:42:24.950 --> 01:42:24.960 align:start position:0%
would look at
 
01:42:28.470 --> 01:42:28.480 align:start position:0%
yeah yes representative harad thank you
 
01:42:31.629 --> 01:42:31.639 align:start position:0%
chair just a comment um I may be at a
 
01:42:33.950 --> 01:42:33.960 align:start position:0%
little bit of an advantage here having
 
01:42:37.270 --> 01:42:37.280 align:start position:0%
provided the exact services in question
 
01:42:40.709 --> 01:42:40.719 align:start position:0%
uh 40 years ago and now I do it again a
 
01:42:43.790 --> 01:42:43.800 align:start position:0%
day or two a week uh here at Riverbend
 
01:42:45.510 --> 01:42:45.520 align:start position:0%
um you've really described the the
 
01:42:47.870 --> 01:42:47.880 align:start position:0%
challenge I think uh representative
 
01:42:50.470 --> 01:42:50.480 align:start position:0%
Weber it's really about what do you do
 
01:42:53.510 --> 01:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
with these 10 cases when you have a an
 
01:42:56.109 --> 01:42:56.119 align:start position:0%
involuntary emergency commitment law
 
01:42:58.470 --> 01:42:58.480 align:start position:0%
that expressly prohibits people with
 
01:43:00.669 --> 01:43:00.679 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities from being
 
01:43:03.430 --> 01:43:03.440 align:start position:0%
involuntarily committed I think
 
01:43:05.270 --> 01:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
representative McKay hit it on the head
 
01:43:08.390 --> 01:43:08.400 align:start position:0%
too in that there you are at 3:00 in the
 
01:43:10.709 --> 01:43:10.719 align:start position:0%
morning in an emergency room with a
 
01:43:14.669 --> 01:43:14.679 align:start position:0%
16-year-old who's behaving uh terribly
 
01:43:14.679 --> 01:43:15.950 align:start position:0%
16-year-old who's behaving uh terribly
and

01:43:15.950 --> 01:43:15.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:43:18.629 --> 01:43:18.639 align:start position:0%
diagnostically you you really can't
 
01:43:21.470 --> 01:43:21.480 align:start position:0%
reasonably sort out is this a function
 
01:43:23.550 --> 01:43:23.560 align:start position:0%
of a developmental disability or or some
 
01:43:26.669 --> 01:43:26.679 align:start position:0%
other psychiatric uh challenge so you're
 
01:43:29.750 --> 01:43:29.760 align:start position:0%
really these emergency rooms are just uh
 
01:43:32.350 --> 01:43:32.360 align:start position:0%
awfully stuck and whether you have a
 
01:43:34.750 --> 01:43:34.760 align:start position:0%
seasoned psychiatrist a seasoned
 
01:43:37.149 --> 01:43:37.159 align:start position:0%
emergency worker you know working the
 
01:43:40.589 --> 01:43:40.599 align:start position:0%
case you just simply can't sort it out
 
01:43:43.830 --> 01:43:43.840 align:start position:0%
that quickly so the law does uh pose
 
01:43:45.950 --> 01:43:45.960 align:start position:0%
some real challenges there's also a
 
01:43:49.229 --> 01:43:49.239 align:start position:0%
training issue for the uh the people who
 
01:43:51.550 --> 01:43:51.560 align:start position:0%
are actually doing the work as well
 
01:43:53.390 --> 01:43:53.400 align:start position:0%
having done the work and having run in a
 
01:43:55.109 --> 01:43:55.119 align:start position:0%
psychiatric emergency service for a
 
01:43:57.310 --> 01:43:57.320 align:start position:0%
number of years I can tell you your
 
01:44:00.510 --> 01:44:00.520 align:start position:0%
staff people are not uh trained to make
 
01:44:03.550 --> 01:44:03.560 align:start position:0%
these kind of subtle uh diagnostic
 
01:44:06.870 --> 01:44:06.880 align:start position:0%
distinctions in this complicated legal
 
01:44:10.390 --> 01:44:10.400 align:start position:0%
you know uh uh Arrangement as well so I
 
01:44:12.189 --> 01:44:12.199 align:start position:0%
think it's a very good and reasonable
 
01:44:15.030 --> 01:44:15.040 align:start position:0%
thing to take a peek at uh and and move
 
01:44:17.709 --> 01:44:17.719 align:start position:0%
forward with the Bill thank you thank
 
01:44:19.870 --> 01:44:19.880 align:start position:0%
you representative Maser yes thank you
 
01:44:22.070 --> 01:44:22.080 align:start position:0%
Mr chair um and I'm not sure you can
 
01:44:23.990 --> 01:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
answer my question but it was kind of
 
01:44:26.910 --> 01:44:26.920 align:start position:0%
off of what representative Nagel asked
 
01:44:30.189 --> 01:44:30.199 align:start position:0%
um or alluded to that are there other
 
01:44:32.669 --> 01:44:32.679 align:start position:0%
commissions SLC committees out there
 
01:44:36.030 --> 01:44:36.040 align:start position:0%
right now that may may be doing
 
01:44:38.470 --> 01:44:38.480 align:start position:0%
something similar that this can just be
 
01:44:40.669 --> 01:44:40.679 align:start position:0%
wrapped under instead of establishing a
 
01:44:40.679 --> 01:44:42.109 align:start position:0%
wrapped under instead of establishing a
new

01:44:42.109 --> 01:44:42.119 align:start position:0%
new
 
01:44:45.350 --> 01:44:45.360 align:start position:0%
commission I'm I'm unaware of another
 
01:44:46.990 --> 01:44:47.000 align:start position:0%
commission that is working on this
 
01:44:49.189 --> 01:44:49.199 align:start position:0%
specifically person so I I I can't
 
01:44:50.870 --> 01:44:50.880 align:start position:0%
answer that question there may be but I
 
01:44:54.070 --> 01:44:54.080 align:start position:0%
am unaware of it
 
01:44:54.080 --> 01:44:56.390 align:start position:0%
am unaware of it
other

01:44:56.390 --> 01:44:56.400 align:start position:0%
other

01:45:04.350 --> 01:45:04.360 align:start position:0%

03:02:01.590 --> 03:02:01.600 align:start position:0%

of Derry which is Rockingham 13 and I am
 
03:02:09.630 --> 03:02:09.640 align:start position:0%
here today with a bill that um would
 
03:02:11.150 --> 03:02:11.160 align:start position:0%
have been brought to you by another
 
03:02:14.269 --> 03:02:14.279 align:start position:0%
former member Gary Merchant um however
 
03:02:16.910 --> 03:02:16.920 align:start position:0%
he was not victorious in his election we
 
03:02:18.750 --> 03:02:18.760 align:start position:0%
can't let good Poli y fall to the
 
03:02:22.070 --> 03:02:22.080 align:start position:0%
Wayside um so I am here today to help
 
03:02:23.870 --> 03:02:23.880 align:start position:0%
ensure that we can have access to the
 
03:02:26.510 --> 03:02:26.520 align:start position:0%
newest FDA approved emergency
 
03:02:29.030 --> 03:02:29.040 align:start position:0%
epinephrine product um especially for
 
03:02:31.750 --> 03:02:31.760 align:start position:0%
children in in the appropriate settings
 
03:02:33.229 --> 03:02:33.239 align:start position:0%
so I've distributed three different
 
03:02:35.469 --> 03:02:35.479 align:start position:0%
pieces of paper to you um the first one
 
03:02:37.670 --> 03:02:37.680 align:start position:0%
here is why we're here it's the FDA
 
03:02:40.150 --> 03:02:40.160 align:start position:0%
approval of this nasal spray it's called
 
03:02:43.269 --> 03:02:43.279 align:start position:0%
nephy as the brand names so um I might
 
03:02:45.830 --> 03:02:45.840 align:start position:0%
refer to it as nephy a few times right
 
03:02:48.590 --> 03:02:48.600 align:start position:0%
now we allow camps uh um basically
 
03:02:52.030 --> 03:02:52.040 align:start position:0%
summer camps or or whatnot and schools
 
03:02:54.870 --> 03:02:54.880 align:start position:0%
to have uh to administer this and to
 
03:02:57.950 --> 03:02:57.960 align:start position:0%
have the epinephrine um on hand so that
 
03:02:59.630 --> 03:02:59.640 align:start position:0%
they can administer it to a student who
 
03:03:02.190 --> 03:03:02.200 align:start position:0%
needs it right now our law speaks about
 
03:03:04.910 --> 03:03:04.920 align:start position:0%
Auto injectors because until last August

9th we had epipens but we had no other
 
03:03:10.910 --> 03:03:10.920 align:start position:0%
way to get epinephrine into uh somebody
 
03:03:12.670 --> 03:03:12.680 align:start position:0%
somebody who is experiencing an
 
03:03:15.349 --> 03:03:15.359 align:start position:0%
anaphylactic reaction so this actually
 
03:03:17.590 --> 03:03:17.600 align:start position:0%
uses pretty known technology it's using
 
03:03:20.550 --> 03:03:20.560 align:start position:0%
the same device as Naran so it's
 
03:03:23.110 --> 03:03:23.120 align:start position:0%
approved uh device that already people
 
03:03:24.830 --> 03:03:24.840 align:start position:0%
already know how to deliver and is very
 
03:03:27.389 --> 03:03:27.399 align:start position:0%
very easy to use it's smaller so it's
 
03:03:29.870 --> 03:03:29.880 align:start position:0%
easier to have on hand and it actually
 
03:03:31.990 --> 03:03:32.000 align:start position:0%
has a longer shelf life so it will be
 
03:03:34.229 --> 03:03:34.239 align:start position:0%
good at the camp or the school as long
 
03:03:35.870 --> 03:03:35.880 align:start position:0%
as they're not leaving it out in the sun
 
03:03:37.990 --> 03:03:38.000 align:start position:0%
in the field it'll be good for 30 months
 
03:03:39.550 --> 03:03:39.560 align:start position:0%
if they are leaving it out in the sun in
 
03:03:41.309 --> 03:03:41.319 align:start position:0%
the field or on the dashboard of a car
 
03:03:43.550 --> 03:03:43.560 align:start position:0%
it's still good for three months so if
 
03:03:45.389 --> 03:03:45.399 align:start position:0%
they want to be that aggressive and make
 
03:03:46.670 --> 03:03:46.680 align:start position:0%
sure that they have it out there on the
 
03:03:48.990 --> 03:03:49.000 align:start position:0%
ball field with them at summer camp they
 
03:03:50.830 --> 03:03:50.840 align:start position:0%
can do it and just replace it each year
 
03:03:52.910 --> 03:03:52.920 align:start position:0%
since summer camp only lasts three year
 
03:03:52.920 --> 03:03:53.750 align:start position:0%
since summer camp only lasts three year
three

03:03:53.750 --> 03:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
three
 
03:03:56.469 --> 03:03:56.479 align:start position:0%
months so this seems like a really
 
03:03:58.710 --> 03:03:58.720 align:start position:0%
really big and daunting Bill considering
 
03:04:02.790 --> 03:04:02.800 align:start position:0%
that it is uh nine pages long but what
 
03:04:06.030 --> 03:04:06.040 align:start position:0%
it does is it adds nasal spray along
 
03:04:09.389 --> 03:04:09.399 align:start position:0%
with the auto injectors um I have been
 
03:04:11.389 --> 03:04:11.399 align:start position:0%
contacted by the New Hampshire
 
03:04:14.190 --> 03:04:14.200 align:start position:0%
pharmacist Association because they
 
03:04:18.750 --> 03:04:18.760 align:start position:0%
noticed um a little bit of a disconnect
 
03:04:20.790 --> 03:04:20.800 align:start position:0%
in these statutes and the ones that were
 
03:04:22.510 --> 03:04:22.520 align:start position:0%
passed last year that would allow them
 
03:04:24.870 --> 03:04:24.880 align:start position:0%
to allow the schools to stalk the
 
03:04:27.429 --> 03:04:27.439 align:start position:0%
epinephrine not in not specifically for
 
03:04:29.950 --> 03:04:29.960 align:start position:0%
any specific student there was nothing
 
03:04:31.870 --> 03:04:31.880 align:start position:0%
in the pharmacy statutes telling the
 
03:04:33.790 --> 03:04:33.800 align:start position:0%
pharmacists that they could do it so
 
03:04:35.190 --> 03:04:35.200 align:start position:0%
after a back and forth and some
 
03:04:37.510 --> 03:04:37.520 align:start position:0%
conversation it was fine to let it
 
03:04:39.630 --> 03:04:39.640 align:start position:0%
happen but when you're looking at school
 
03:04:40.830 --> 03:04:40.840 align:start position:0%
nurses and when you're looking at
 
03:04:42.950 --> 03:04:42.960 align:start position:0%
Pharmacists it's a lot easier to have
 
03:04:45.950 --> 03:04:45.960 align:start position:0%
this in their statute and say that a
 
03:04:48.110 --> 03:04:48.120 align:start position:0%
pharmacist made Spence up and have Auto
 
03:04:50.389 --> 03:04:50.399 align:start position:0%
injectors and epinephrine nasal spray
 
03:04:52.229 --> 03:04:52.239 align:start position:0%
pursuant to a prescription issued in the
 
03:04:54.150 --> 03:04:54.160 align:start position:0%
name of a school postsecondary
 
03:04:56.269 --> 03:04:56.279 align:start position:0%
institution or independent school a
 
03:04:57.950 --> 03:04:57.960 align:start position:0%
school Under the direction of the school
 
03:04:59.550 --> 03:04:59.560 align:start position:0%
nurse May maintain a supply of
 
03:05:01.389 --> 03:05:01.399 align:start position:0%
epinephrine Auto injectors and
 
03:05:03.950 --> 03:05:03.960 align:start position:0%
epinephrine nasal spray for use in
 
03:05:05.670 --> 03:05:05.680 align:start position:0%
accordance with and it's the school
 
03:05:07.550 --> 03:05:07.560 align:start position:0%
statutes so that would just make it a
 
03:05:10.950 --> 03:05:10.960 align:start position:0%
lot easier and a lot cleaner um and
 
03:05:12.910 --> 03:05:12.920 align:start position:0%
there's a really really big big reason
 
03:05:14.870 --> 03:05:14.880 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure that we can do this
 
03:05:16.790 --> 03:05:16.800 align:start position:0%
um this company that makes this new
 
03:05:20.030 --> 03:05:20.040 align:start position:0%
nasal spray is has a program to offer it
 
03:05:22.990 --> 03:05:23.000 align:start position:0%
to all schools all K through 12 Schools
 
03:05:24.990 --> 03:05:25.000 align:start position:0%
public or private um as long as it's
 
03:05:27.269 --> 03:05:27.279 align:start position:0%
allowed by state law they'll provide two
 
03:05:29.990 --> 03:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
boxes of it so that's four of the nasal
 
03:05:33.269 --> 03:05:33.279 align:start position:0%
inject nasal sprays um and they'll
 
03:05:34.950 --> 03:05:34.960 align:start position:0%
replace them so this is something that's
 
03:05:38.030 --> 03:05:38.040 align:start position:0%
going to increase access to um
 
03:05:39.990 --> 03:05:40.000 align:start position:0%
life-saving care in our schools at no
 
03:05:41.670 --> 03:05:41.680 align:start position:0%
cost to the state there's another
 
03:05:44.269 --> 03:05:44.279 align:start position:0%
separate bill House Bill 677 that's an
 
03:05:46.950 --> 03:05:46.960 align:start position:0%
education policy and administration that
 
03:05:48.790 --> 03:05:48.800 align:start position:0%
will be updating those statutes and
 
03:05:51.190 --> 03:05:51.200 align:start position:0%
dealing with that but the job of this
 
03:05:52.710 --> 03:05:52.720 align:start position:0%
committee is to make sure that the
 
03:05:54.790 --> 03:05:54.800 align:start position:0%
pharmacists can do what they need to do
 
03:05:56.750 --> 03:05:56.760 align:start position:0%
and that we update the statutes on camps
 
03:06:00.110 --> 03:06:00.120 align:start position:0%
and schools um in order to permit this
 
03:06:02.510 --> 03:06:02.520 align:start position:0%
new novel technology so with that I'm
 
03:06:03.790 --> 03:06:03.800 align:start position:0%
happy to take any
 
03:06:06.269 --> 03:06:06.279 align:start position:0%
questions are there any questions
 
03:06:06.279 --> 03:06:07.670 align:start position:0%
questions are there any questions
representative

03:06:07.670 --> 03:06:07.680 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:06:11.269 --> 03:06:11.279 align:start position:0%
Weber will you be obtaining the official
 
03:06:13.190 --> 03:06:13.200 align:start position:0%
Amendment or should somebody from the
 
03:06:15.550 --> 03:06:15.560 align:start position:0%
committee do that um I actually obtained
 
03:06:17.790 --> 03:06:17.800 align:start position:0%
one along with representative groda
 
03:06:19.790 --> 03:06:19.800 align:start position:0%
because she is a co-sponsor of the bill
 
03:06:21.150 --> 03:06:21.160 align:start position:0%
um she and I looked at it yesterday
 
03:06:22.349 --> 03:06:22.359 align:start position:0%
sorry I didn't get all the way down
 
03:06:25.910 --> 03:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
through the I I saw the one with the
 
03:06:28.070 --> 03:06:28.080 align:start position:0%
yellow thing but you've already got so
 
03:06:30.910 --> 03:06:30.920 align:start position:0%
this is the amendment correct officially
 
03:06:33.349 --> 03:06:33.359 align:start position:0%
that has the yellow language on it so we
 
03:06:35.950 --> 03:06:35.960 align:start position:0%
have everything in front of us yes and
 
03:06:37.670 --> 03:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
on that second page where it's yellow
 
03:06:39.309 --> 03:06:39.319 align:start position:0%
highlighted there's an asteris which
 
03:06:41.590 --> 03:06:41.600 align:start position:0%
shows you where it fits into the larger
 
03:06:44.269 --> 03:06:44.279 align:start position:0%
scheme of all of those laws um because
 
03:06:45.670 --> 03:06:45.680 align:start position:0%
one without the other is sort of
 
03:06:48.190 --> 03:06:48.200 align:start position:0%
incomplete right thank you you very much
 
03:06:49.670 --> 03:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
you're welcome although thank you for
 
03:06:50.950 --> 03:06:50.960 align:start position:0%
this you're welcome I don't know how
 
03:06:52.510 --> 03:06:52.520 align:start position:0%
long you need to retain that information
 
03:06:54.990 --> 03:06:55.000 align:start position:0%
unless you're the clerk but it's good to
 
03:06:58.349 --> 03:06:58.359 align:start position:0%
see representative Woods oh thank you Mr
 
03:06:59.550 --> 03:06:59.560 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
03:07:03.030 --> 03:07:03.040 align:start position:0%
question um uh this is obviously a
 
03:07:05.110 --> 03:07:05.120 align:start position:0%
needed entity and sort of a check the
 
03:07:07.630 --> 03:07:07.640 align:start position:0%
box type thing U my question Senator
 
03:07:10.870 --> 03:07:10.880 align:start position:0%
around uh doesn't seem to apply to
 
03:07:14.510 --> 03:07:14.520 align:start position:0%
Industry um we don't necessarily have a
 
03:07:17.510 --> 03:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
a big huge General Motors plant here
 
03:07:20.389 --> 03:07:20.399 align:start position:0%
that might qualify to get such but um is
 
03:07:23.309 --> 03:07:23.319 align:start position:0%
there any con consideration to include
 
03:07:26.469 --> 03:07:26.479 align:start position:0%
uh industry uh in their ability to have
 
03:07:29.389 --> 03:07:29.399 align:start position:0%
this available um thank you that's
 
03:07:30.870 --> 03:07:30.880 align:start position:0%
actually a wonderful question I think
 
03:07:32.229 --> 03:07:32.239 align:start position:0%
that would be going pretty far outside
 
03:07:34.269 --> 03:07:34.279 align:start position:0%
of the scope of this but if you and I
 
03:07:36.469 --> 03:07:36.479 align:start position:0%
want to drop something for next year of
 
03:07:38.349 --> 03:07:38.359 align:start position:0%
this term I'd be happy to do that
 
03:07:41.190 --> 03:07:41.200 align:start position:0%
because just like aeds save lives this
 
03:07:42.590 --> 03:07:42.600 align:start position:0%
also saves
 
03:07:45.670 --> 03:07:45.680 align:start position:0%
lives and um and actually one of the
 
03:07:47.150 --> 03:07:47.160 align:start position:0%
other things is right now they list
 
03:07:49.469 --> 03:07:49.479 align:start position:0%
price is around $700 but they have an
 
03:07:51.830 --> 03:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
access where with insurance co-pays it
 
03:07:53.910 --> 03:07:53.920 align:start position:0%
should get to $25 and they're working
 
03:07:56.190 --> 03:07:56.200 align:start position:0%
with good RX where it's $25 even if you
 
03:07:57.429 --> 03:07:57.439 align:start position:0%
don't have
 
03:07:59.469 --> 03:07:59.479 align:start position:0%
insurance those of you in the healthcare
 
03:08:01.190 --> 03:08:01.200 align:start position:0%
industry know how the list and actual
 
03:08:03.429 --> 03:08:03.439 align:start position:0%
need to be
 
03:08:06.309 --> 03:08:06.319 align:start position:0%
different other
 
03:08:09.309 --> 03:08:09.319 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none okay thank you
 
03:08:21.590 --> 03:08:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:25.389 --> 03:08:25.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:28.429 --> 03:08:28.439 align:start position:0%
one I should I think she only gave you
 
03:08:35.070 --> 03:08:35.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:37.110 --> 03:08:37.120 align:start position:0%
doubt if you
 
03:08:39.469 --> 03:08:39.479 align:start position:0%
didn't also signed up to speak is
 
03:08:48.870 --> 03:08:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:52.030 --> 03:08:52.040 align:start position:0%
it actually says Judiciary on it you
 
03:08:52.040 --> 03:08:58.150 align:start position:0%
it actually says Judiciary on it you
me

03:08:58.150 --> 03:08:58.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:00.990 --> 03:09:01.000 align:start position:0%
okay sure
 
03:09:03.510 --> 03:09:03.520 align:start position:0%
okay feel free to pull another you have
 
03:09:05.070 --> 03:09:05.080 align:start position:0%
another enough room there or you need
 
03:09:05.080 --> 03:09:05.910 align:start position:0%
another enough room there or you need
another

03:09:05.910 --> 03:09:05.920 align:start position:0%
another
 
03:09:09.030 --> 03:09:09.040 align:start position:0%
chair okay ma'am can can you spell your
 
03:09:24.150 --> 03:09:24.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:27.870 --> 03:09:27.880 align:start position:0%
all right so um dear members of the
 
03:09:30.229 --> 03:09:30.239 align:start position:0%
committee um for the record my name is
 
03:09:32.790 --> 03:09:32.800 align:start position:0%
Kristen Evans and I live in pelum and I
 
03:09:35.950 --> 03:09:35.960 align:start position:0%
am here today as a parent so not in my
 
03:09:40.630 --> 03:09:40.640 align:start position:0%
official job um for me I'm here to
 
03:09:43.070 --> 03:09:43.080 align:start position:0%
express my full support for House Bill
 
03:09:45.830 --> 03:09:45.840 align:start position:0%
63 for me this isn't just legislation
 
03:09:48.389 --> 03:09:48.399 align:start position:0%
it's life or death my 1-year-old son
 
03:09:51.349 --> 03:09:51.359 align:start position:0%
Truman has life-threatening allergies
 
03:09:54.070 --> 03:09:54.080 align:start position:0%
and every day I live with the knowledge
 
03:09:57.110 --> 03:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
that a single mistake a single exposure
 
03:09:59.469 --> 03:09:59.479 align:start position:0%
could change our lives forever when
 
03:10:01.870 --> 03:10:01.880 align:start position:0%
Truman was first diagnosed I quickly
 
03:10:05.469 --> 03:10:05.479 align:start position:0%
learned how fragile safety is seconds
 
03:10:08.309 --> 03:10:08.319 align:start position:0%
matter during an anaphylactic reaction
 
03:10:10.630 --> 03:10:10.640 align:start position:0%
those precious seconds can mean the
 
03:10:13.030 --> 03:10:13.040 align:start position:0%
difference between life and death yet
 
03:10:15.229 --> 03:10:15.239 align:start position:0%
hesitation or fear in administering
 
03:10:18.030 --> 03:10:18.040 align:start position:0%
epinephrine is all too common
 
03:10:20.269 --> 03:10:20.279 align:start position:0%
especially for those who care for
 
03:10:22.349 --> 03:10:22.359 align:start position:0%
children these are the people who may
 
03:10:24.110 --> 03:10:24.120 align:start position:0%
find themselves in the position to Save
 
03:10:26.309 --> 03:10:26.319 align:start position:0%
a Life and we need to give them every
 
03:10:29.229 --> 03:10:29.239 align:start position:0%
possible tool to act with confidence and
 
03:10:29.239 --> 03:10:30.110 align:start position:0%
possible tool to act with confidence and
without

03:10:30.110 --> 03:10:30.120 align:start position:0%
without
 
03:10:32.830 --> 03:10:32.840 align:start position:0%
delay today Truman is here with me and
 
03:10:34.670 --> 03:10:34.680 align:start position:0%
he will share his own perspective about
 
03:10:36.389 --> 03:10:36.399 align:start position:0%
what it's like to live with the constant
 
03:10:39.030 --> 03:10:39.040 align:start position:0%
RIS risk of anaphylaxis I've also
 
03:10:40.670 --> 03:10:40.680 align:start position:0%
brought with me the three types of
 
03:10:43.269 --> 03:10:43.279 align:start position:0%
epinephrine devices we rely on to keep
 
03:10:45.710 --> 03:10:45.720 align:start position:0%
them safe I have the traditional auto
 
03:10:45.720 --> 03:10:47.469 align:start position:0%
them safe I have the traditional auto
injector

03:10:47.469 --> 03:10:47.479 align:start position:0%
injector
 
03:10:49.389 --> 03:10:49.399 align:start position:0%
this is the needle the
 
03:10:52.590 --> 03:10:52.600 align:start position:0%
avq auto injector this one talks to you
 
03:10:57.630 --> 03:10:57.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:00.630 --> 03:11:00.640 align:start position:0%
it it walks you through it which is nice
 
03:11:01.870 --> 03:11:01.880 align:start position:0%
but those are usually hard to get and
 
03:11:03.510 --> 03:11:03.520 align:start position:0%
then we brought the nephy so if anybody
 
03:11:06.110 --> 03:11:06.120 align:start position:0%
wants to see what it looks like um we
 
03:11:09.469 --> 03:11:09.479 align:start position:0%
also have the so
 
03:11:12.550 --> 03:11:12.560 align:start position:0%
um the nephy is small and portable and
 
03:11:15.870 --> 03:11:15.880 align:start position:0%
simple enough for anybody to use um the
 
03:11:17.710 --> 03:11:17.720 align:start position:0%
bill is not just about convenience it's
 
03:11:19.590 --> 03:11:19.600 align:start position:0%
about empowering caregivers to save
 
03:11:21.790 --> 03:11:21.800 align:start position:0%
lives it's about ensuring that when the
 
03:11:24.349 --> 03:11:24.359 align:start position:0%
unthinkable happens those who are
 
03:11:25.790 --> 03:11:25.800 align:start position:0%
entrusted with the safety of our
 
03:11:28.229 --> 03:11:28.239 align:start position:0%
children have the tools they need to act
 
03:11:30.910 --> 03:11:30.920 align:start position:0%
immediately and effectively I urge you
 
03:11:33.510 --> 03:11:33.520 align:start position:0%
to pass House Bill 63 for every child
 
03:11:36.110 --> 03:11:36.120 align:start position:0%
who depends on others to protect them in
 
03:11:38.750 --> 03:11:38.760 align:start position:0%
crucial moments thank you for your time
 
03:11:41.990 --> 03:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:44.469 --> 03:11:44.479 align:start position:0%
consideration thank you do you want to
 
03:11:46.030 --> 03:11:46.040 align:start position:0%
take questions or would tman like to go
 
03:11:49.910 --> 03:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:52.790 --> 03:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
them my name is fruman and I am 17 years
 
03:11:54.790 --> 03:11:54.800 align:start position:0%
old and I live in P I'm here today to
 
03:11:56.990 --> 03:11:57.000 align:start position:0%
share why passing House Bill 63 is so
 
03:11:59.030 --> 03:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
important could you maybe P get closer
 
03:12:01.870 --> 03:12:01.880 align:start position:0%
to the mic I'm sorry about
 
03:12:04.590 --> 03:12:04.600 align:start position:0%
that my name is Shuman and I am 17 years
 
03:12:06.590 --> 03:12:06.600 align:start position:0%
old and I live in pelum I'm here today
 
03:12:08.710 --> 03:12:08.720 align:start position:0%
to share why passing house bills 63 is
 
03:12:10.510 --> 03:12:10.520 align:start position:0%
so important to me and others like me
 
03:12:12.590 --> 03:12:12.600 align:start position:0%
who live with life threatening allergies
 
03:12:14.070 --> 03:12:14.080 align:start position:0%
since I was young I've had to carry an
 
03:12:16.510 --> 03:12:16.520 align:start position:0%
iip pen everywhere I go it's just a part
 
03:12:17.830 --> 03:12:17.840 align:start position:0%
of my life but but that doesn't make it
 
03:12:20.110 --> 03:12:20.120 align:start position:0%
easy living with severe allergies means
 
03:12:21.710 --> 03:12:21.720 align:start position:0%
I'm always thinking about what I eat
 
03:12:23.269 --> 03:12:23.279 align:start position:0%
where I go and whether the people around
 
03:12:25.269 --> 03:12:25.279 align:start position:0%
me are prepared to help if I ever have
 
03:12:27.510 --> 03:12:27.520 align:start position:0%
an anaphylactic reaction it's not
 
03:12:28.870 --> 03:12:28.880 align:start position:0%
something I can ever take lightly
 
03:12:30.469 --> 03:12:30.479 align:start position:0%
because I know how quickly an allergic
 
03:12:32.990 --> 03:12:33.000 align:start position:0%
reaction can turn into an emergency even
 
03:12:34.670 --> 03:12:34.680 align:start position:0%
though I carry an iip pen and know how
 
03:12:36.229 --> 03:12:36.239 align:start position:0%
to use it there's always the chance that
 
03:12:39.150 --> 03:12:39.160 align:start position:0%
I might not be able to administer it
 
03:12:41.550 --> 03:12:41.560 align:start position:0%
myself in those moments I have to trust
 
03:12:43.190 --> 03:12:43.200 align:start position:0%
the people around me can step in and
 
03:12:45.429 --> 03:12:45.439 align:start position:0%
help I don't know how intimidating that
 
03:12:47.830 --> 03:12:47.840 align:start position:0%
can be for someone who has never handled
 
03:12:50.510 --> 03:12:50.520 align:start position:0%
before that's why House Bill 63 matters
 
03:12:52.910 --> 03:12:52.920 align:start position:0%
so much allowing schools camps and other
 
03:12:55.469 --> 03:12:55.479 align:start position:0%
places to use epinephrine nasal spray
 
03:12:57.469 --> 03:12:57.479 align:start position:0%
would make a huge difference the nasal
 
03:12:59.110 --> 03:12:59.120 align:start position:0%
spray is easy to use and doesn't involve
 
03:13:01.110 --> 03:13:01.120 align:start position:0%
a needle which can be scar for people
 
03:13:03.389 --> 03:13:03.399 align:start position:0%
who aren't used to giving injections an
 
03:13:05.750 --> 03:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
emergency when every second counts I've
 
03:13:07.309 --> 03:13:07.319 align:start position:0%
have some something simple and
 
03:13:09.630 --> 03:13:09.640 align:start position:0%
straightforward can save lives I try to
 
03:13:11.630 --> 03:13:11.640 align:start position:0%
be prepared for anything but I also know
 
03:13:14.229 --> 03:13:14.239 align:start position:0%
that I can't do it all on my own passing
 
03:13:15.710 --> 03:13:15.720 align:start position:0%
this bill would mean that the people I
 
03:13:17.269 --> 03:13:17.279 align:start position:0%
trust to look out for me would have have
 
03:13:19.229 --> 03:13:19.239 align:start position:0%
an easier way to help if I ever needed
 
03:13:21.150 --> 03:13:21.160 align:start position:0%
it it's about making sure that no one
 
03:13:22.550 --> 03:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
hesitates when there's a tool that can
 
03:13:25.429 --> 03:13:25.439 align:start position:0%
make acting quickly less overwhelming I
 
03:13:27.110 --> 03:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
I hope you will consider how important
 
03:13:28.830 --> 03:13:28.840 align:start position:0%
this is not just for me but every kid
 
03:13:30.910 --> 03:13:30.920 align:start position:0%
like me who relies on others to step in
 
03:13:33.070 --> 03:13:33.080 align:start position:0%
during a life-threatening situation
 
03:13:34.070 --> 03:13:34.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time and for
 
03:13:35.910 --> 03:13:35.920 align:start position:0%

bathroom of a restaurant uh I think it
 
03:14:39.229 --> 03:14:39.239 align:start position:0%

03:14:42.269 --> 03:14:42.279 align:start position:0%
Sunday before I'd eaten something that I
 
03:14:46.150 --> 03:14:46.160 align:start position:0%
didn't realize was going to react and uh
 
03:14:49.110 --> 03:14:49.120 align:start position:0%
I don't have anaphylaxis so I don't need
 
03:14:51.750 --> 03:14:51.760 align:start position:0%
the the epinephrine but I was on the
 
03:14:54.429 --> 03:14:54.439 align:start position:0%
floor and I didn't have my phone and I

representative um Weber
 
03:36:50.950 --> 03:36:50.960 align:start position:0%
uh the amendment is uh now I've lost my
 
03:36:52.389 --> 03:36:52.399 align:start position:0%

2025
 
03:37:01.389 --> 03:37:01.399 align:start position:0%
67h and it simply allows supplies to be
 
03:37:03.429 --> 03:37:03.439 align:start position:0%
kept on hand that have not been
 
03:37:06.550 --> 03:37:06.560 align:start position:0%
prescribed for a specific individual and
 
03:37:08.910 --> 03:37:08.920 align:start position:0%
because it's quite possible that
 
03:37:11.870 --> 03:37:11.880 align:start position:0%
individuals go into an anaphylactic
 
03:37:14.710 --> 03:37:14.720 align:start position:0%
shock the first time and don't have

anything having them on hand is very
 
03:37:19.790 --> 03:37:19.800 align:start position:0%
important so um I would move the
 
03:37:21.630 --> 03:37:21.640 align:start position:0%

method of of delivery for important uh
 
03:37:53.750 --> 03:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
epinephrine in case of anaphylactic

03:43:29.349 --> 03:43:29.359 align:start position:0%
and it's all new to me so it's who Moved
 
03:43:34.590 --> 03:43:34.600 align:start position:0%
who seconded I know mean no yeah no I
 
03:43:36.870 --> 03:43:36.880 align:start position:0%
just I always just make it up on and
 
03:43:38.389 --> 03:43:38.399 align:start position:0%
that way I have
 
03:43:45.830 --> 03:43:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:49.229 --> 03:43:49.239 align:start position:0%
you need you need you need this
 
03:43:52.710 --> 03:43:52.720 align:start position:0%
separate the well
 
03:43:54.910 --> 03:43:54.920 align:start position:0%
might the way I usually do it and I
 
03:43:55.950 --> 03:43:55.960 align:start position:0%
think the way you're supposed to do it
 
03:43:57.830 --> 03:43:57.840 align:start position:0%
is the motion would be TP for just the
 
03:43:59.710 --> 03:43:59.720 align:start position:0%
amendment and then it would be the bill
 
03:43:59.720 --> 03:44:01.070 align:start position:0%
amendment and then it would be the bill
number

03:44:01.070 --> 03:44:01.080 align:start position:0%
number
 
03:44:04.710 --> 03:44:04.720 align:start position:0%
TPA and and then
 
03:44:07.309 --> 03:44:07.319 align:start position:0%
change usually usually I believe it's
 
03:44:11.189 --> 03:44:11.199 align:start position:0%
fistic I always speak I guess that's the
 
03:44:14.469 --> 03:44:14.479 align:start position:0%
advantage of pencil yeah but you got
 
03:44:16.429 --> 03:44:16.439 align:start position:0%
either way yeah to
 
03:44:19.229 --> 03:44:19.239 align:start position:0%
either because sometimes an amendment
 
03:44:22.110 --> 03:44:22.120 align:start position:0%
fails the bill
 
03:44:25.349 --> 03:44:25.359 align:start position:0%
passes would just be you're not writing
 
03:44:28.429 --> 03:44:28.439 align:start position:0%
this I'm writing this but you could TP
 
03:44:30.590 --> 03:44:30.600 align:start position:0%
on the amendment only
 
03:44:32.630 --> 03:44:32.640 align:start position:0%
yeah and again there were separate
 
03:44:37.469 --> 03:44:37.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:41.269 --> 03:44:41.279 align:start position:0%
made I don't think would if they wanted
 
03:44:43.429 --> 03:44:43.439 align:start position:0%
that would they put that on
 
03:44:46.830 --> 03:44:46.840 align:start position:0%
here cab well he he has information too
 
03:44:48.830 --> 03:44:48.840 align:start position:0%
but again the vote on the amendment
 
03:44:50.030 --> 03:44:50.040 align:start position:0%
sometimes is different than the vote on
 
03:44:52.110 --> 03:44:52.120 align:start position:0%
the full Bill too sometimes an amendment
 
03:44:53.870 --> 03:44:53.880 align:start position:0%
will pass what the bill will fail the
 
03:45:02.189 --> 03:45:02.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:08.510 --> 03:45:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:12.870 --> 03:45:12.880 align:start position:0%
34 if there's a new better way or great
 
03:45:16.349 --> 03:45:16.359 align:start position:0%
way to deliver the same drug to help
 
03:45:18.510 --> 03:45:18.520 align:start position:0%
save someone's life it just makes sense
 
03:45:21.710 --> 03:45:21.720 align:start position:0%
and it's so nice and LU that made the
 
03:45:21.720 --> 03:45:24.990 align:start position:0%
and it's so nice and LU that made the
motion

03:45:24.990 --> 03:45:25.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:27.550 --> 03:45:27.560 align:start position:0%
on she made the am motion on the
 
03:45:30.189 --> 03:45:30.199 align:start position:0%
amendment she made the motion on the and
 
03:45:33.870 --> 03:45:33.880 align:start position:0%
she'll be writing the report who
 
03:45:36.070 --> 03:45:36.080 align:start position:0%
delus but but she didn't make the motion
 
03:45:38.429 --> 03:45:38.439 align:start position:0%
on the amendment no I know but it
 
03:45:41.870 --> 03:45:41.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't doesn't say on here doesn't ask
 
03:45:45.389 --> 03:45:45.399 align:start position:0%
you right usually usually the one of the
 
03:45:48.790 --> 03:45:48.800 align:start position:0%
same but so anyway I'll send this and
 
03:45:51.349 --> 03:45:51.359 align:start position:0%
see if they have a problem all right
 
03:45:53.550 --> 03:45:53.560 align:start position:0%
it'll be easy to change
 
03:45:58.950 --> 03:45:58.960 align:start position:0%
yeah this right coun yes minority Noone
 
03:45:58.960 --> 03:46:02.550 align:start position:0%
yeah this right coun yes minority Noone
that

03:46:02.550 --> 03:46:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:05.429 --> 03:46:05.439 align:start position:0%
exactly I'll this to
 
03:46:05.439 --> 03:46:12.830 align:start position:0%
exactly I'll this to
Sean

03:46:12.830 --> 03:46:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:17.389 --> 03:46:17.399 align:start position:0%
okay I wasn't speak not here if you want
 
03:46:20.750 --> 03:46:20.760 align:start position:0%

thank you very much Mr chairman members
 
03:47:00.510 --> 03:47:00.520 align:start position:0%
of the committee for the record my name
 
03:47:02.870 --> 03:47:02.880 align:start position:0%
is Dan Maguire I represent the town of
 
03:47:06.510 --> 03:47:06.520 align:start position:0%
Epsom this bill is kind of a followon to
 
03:47:09.550 --> 03:47:09.560 align:start position:0%
a bill that we passed last session that
 
03:47:12.630 --> 03:47:12.640 align:start position:0%
was sponsored by myself and um
 
03:47:14.389 --> 03:47:14.399 align:start position:0%
representative papovich Müller and
 
03:47:17.750 --> 03:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
representa of merchant um I guess former
 
03:47:20.670 --> 03:47:20.680 align:start position:0%
represent of merchant and um so that
 
03:47:24.110 --> 03:47:24.120 align:start position:0%
bill was um
 
03:47:27.790 --> 03:47:27.800 align:start position:0%
for to put an exception into law for
 
03:47:29.750 --> 03:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
certain testosterone
 
03:47:34.830 --> 03:47:34.840 align:start position:0%
treatments um that were of gel form so
 
03:47:37.070 --> 03:47:37.080 align:start position:0%
testosterone if as if you don't
 
03:47:39.950 --> 03:47:39.960 align:start position:0%
understand is a is a kind of a another
 
03:47:45.309 --> 03:47:45.319 align:start position:0%
word for steroid and so um it and so
 
03:47:49.550 --> 03:47:49.560 align:start position:0%
when when uh men typically older men
 
03:47:52.630 --> 03:47:52.640 align:start position:0%
have a have a low testosterone they're
 
03:47:55.910 --> 03:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
prescribed testosterone treatments and
 
03:47:57.750 --> 03:47:57.760 align:start position:0%
kind of the lowest level of that
 
03:48:01.990 --> 03:48:02.000 align:start position:0%
treatment is a gel form and so um it's
 
03:48:03.510 --> 03:48:03.520 align:start position:0%
the kind of treatment it's a kind of
 
03:48:05.870 --> 03:48:05.880 align:start position:0%
situation that doesn't get cured it just
 
03:48:09.149 --> 03:48:09.159 align:start position:0%
gets managed sort of and so once you're
 
03:48:10.990 --> 03:48:11.000 align:start position:0%
on these kind of treatments you're
 
03:48:12.710 --> 03:48:12.720 align:start position:0%
you're essentially on them for the rest
 
03:48:16.030 --> 03:48:16.040 align:start position:0%
of your life or until you know at some
 
03:48:18.030 --> 03:48:18.040 align:start position:0%
point maybe you wean yourself off or
 
03:48:20.790 --> 03:48:20.800 align:start position:0%
you're too old to to use it I don't know
 
03:48:23.590 --> 03:48:23.600 align:start position:0%
but in any case um it's for long periods
 
03:48:28.070 --> 03:48:28.080 align:start position:0%
of time but the problem was that because
 
03:48:31.189 --> 03:48:31.199 align:start position:0%
chemically steroids and testosterone are
 
03:48:32.790 --> 03:48:32.800 align:start position:0%
essentially the same thing or they're in
 
03:48:35.550 --> 03:48:35.560 align:start position:0%
the same category they're they're a
 
03:48:39.750 --> 03:48:39.760 align:start position:0%
class I think it's class two drug um and
 
03:48:42.990 --> 03:48:43.000 align:start position:0%
so you're only allowed in general for
 
03:48:45.830 --> 03:48:45.840 align:start position:0%
this class of drugs to get a a one month
 
03:48:48.030 --> 03:48:48.040 align:start position:0%
prescription well that means you're on
 
03:48:50.349 --> 03:48:50.359 align:start position:0%
something for the rest of your life or a
 
03:48:52.830 --> 03:48:52.840 align:start position:0%
long period of time you're going to pay
 
03:48:57.110 --> 03:48:57.120 align:start position:0%
12 co-pays instead of the normal four uh
 
03:48:59.790 --> 03:48:59.800 align:start position:0%
it's just the hassle of of you know
 
03:49:02.590 --> 03:49:02.600 align:start position:0%
re-upping your prescription frequently
 
03:49:06.110 --> 03:49:06.120 align:start position:0%
and and um uh ordering stuff frequently
 
03:49:10.030 --> 03:49:10.040 align:start position:0%
and all that sort of stuff so so uh the
 
03:49:13.149 --> 03:49:13.159 align:start position:0%
legislature was kind enough to put in an
 
03:49:16.590 --> 03:49:16.600 align:start position:0%
exception for these kind of uh gel
 
03:49:19.710 --> 03:49:19.720 align:start position:0%
treatment testosterone so representative
 
03:49:24.630 --> 03:49:24.640 align:start position:0%
papovich Müller um wanted to expand that
 
03:49:28.309 --> 03:49:28.319 align:start position:0%
to injectable testosterone which is kind
 
03:49:31.550 --> 03:49:31.560 align:start position:0%
of you know if if the gel form is sort
 
03:49:33.910 --> 03:49:33.920 align:start position:0%
of not enough for you right if your if
 
03:49:37.790 --> 03:49:37.800 align:start position:0%
your situation is such that that um it's
 
03:49:40.070 --> 03:49:40.080 align:start position:0%
not strong enough for you I guess then
 
03:49:41.750 --> 03:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
you then the next step is this
 
03:49:44.750 --> 03:49:44.760 align:start position:0%
injectable form and it's essentially the
 
03:49:48.590 --> 03:49:48.600 align:start position:0%
same thing but he put in to this that
 
03:49:50.830 --> 03:49:50.840 align:start position:0%
you have to have had your prescription
 
03:49:54.590 --> 03:49:54.600 align:start position:0%
your Monthly prescription for 12 months
 
03:49:57.070 --> 03:49:57.080 align:start position:0%
so you're on it kind of regularly you've
 
03:49:59.429 --> 03:49:59.439 align:start position:0%
been doing it for 12 months before you
 
03:50:02.710 --> 03:50:02.720 align:start position:0%
can move to a a 90-day I guess it's
 
03:50:06.630 --> 03:50:06.640 align:start position:0%
technically a 92 day um prescription but
 
03:50:09.269 --> 03:50:09.279 align:start position:0%
it's essentially the same issue the same
 
03:50:12.790 --> 03:50:12.800 align:start position:0%
drug Etc but it is a stronger version of
 
03:50:14.830 --> 03:50:14.840 align:start position:0%
this of this drug but it's it's only
 
03:50:18.429 --> 03:50:18.439 align:start position:0%
prescribe to people who really need it
 
03:50:20.830 --> 03:50:20.840 align:start position:0%
and and you know would use it in a
 
03:50:22.389 --> 03:50:22.399 align:start position:0%
regular way
 
03:50:25.269 --> 03:50:25.279 align:start position:0%
so okay thank you any
 
03:50:28.790 --> 03:50:28.800 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative
 
03:50:32.950 --> 03:50:32.960 align:start position:0%
McGrath um so I'm a retail pharmacist
 
03:50:36.550 --> 03:50:36.560 align:start position:0%
and this 12
 
03:50:39.590 --> 03:50:39.600 align:start position:0%
month Monthly prescription before you
 
03:50:43.070 --> 03:50:43.080 align:start position:0%
could get it would be a nightmare to
 
03:50:45.389 --> 03:50:45.399 align:start position:0%
manage in a retail Farm phy people don't
 
03:50:48.550 --> 03:50:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:48.560 --> 03:50:50.269 align:start position:0%
 
pharmacies

03:50:50.269 --> 03:50:50.279 align:start position:0%
pharmacies
 
03:50:53.309 --> 03:50:53.319 align:start position:0%
the you know we have if they might be
 
03:50:56.710 --> 03:50:56.720 align:start position:0%
from out of state I don't I that's that
 
03:50:59.750 --> 03:50:59.760 align:start position:0%
is a nightmare situation for pharmacists
 
03:51:01.030 --> 03:51:01.040 align:start position:0%
so the question thank you for the
 
03:51:03.630 --> 03:51:03.640 align:start position:0%
question representative so I guess your
 
03:51:05.750 --> 03:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
your question is sort of how does the
 
03:51:05.760 --> 03:51:07.149 align:start position:0%
your question is sort of how does the
pharmacist

03:51:07.149 --> 03:51:07.159 align:start position:0%
pharmacist
 
03:51:09.950 --> 03:51:09.960 align:start position:0%
manage how do they know that a person
 
03:51:13.950 --> 03:51:13.960 align:start position:0%
has a 12- month has had a 12-month
 
03:51:13.960 --> 03:51:15.110 align:start position:0%
has a 12- month has had a 12-month
prescription

03:51:15.110 --> 03:51:15.120 align:start position:0%
prescription
 
03:51:18.110 --> 03:51:18.120 align:start position:0%
and I guess
 
03:51:22.630 --> 03:51:22.640 align:start position:0%
um they would have to maybe maybe uh
 
03:51:25.590 --> 03:51:25.600 align:start position:0%
call the person's do do you ever call
 
03:51:27.630 --> 03:51:27.640 align:start position:0%
the person's doctor and say have you
 
03:51:31.469 --> 03:51:31.479 align:start position:0%
given them 12 months so so I think the
 
03:51:33.910 --> 03:51:33.920 align:start position:0%
doctor is the one who makes the
 
03:51:36.229 --> 03:51:36.239 align:start position:0%
prescription right so so doesn't the
 
03:51:39.550 --> 03:51:39.560 align:start position:0%
doctor say now I'm giving you 90 days so
 
03:51:42.229 --> 03:51:42.239 align:start position:0%
the the doctor would have to know okay
 
03:51:44.189 --> 03:51:44.199 align:start position:0%
I'm giving you one month one month and
 
03:51:46.429 --> 03:51:46.439 align:start position:0%
so on okay you've hit a year now I'll
 
03:51:49.269 --> 03:51:49.279 align:start position:0%
start giving you 90 days
 
03:51:51.870 --> 03:51:51.880 align:start position:0%
correct follow
 
03:51:56.550 --> 03:51:56.560 align:start position:0%
up thank you
 
03:51:59.429 --> 03:51:59.439 align:start position:0%
um yeah I mean if it's on the doctor and
 
03:52:02.349 --> 03:52:02.359 align:start position:0%
the pharmacist can just assume that the
 
03:52:04.830 --> 03:52:04.840 align:start position:0%
doctor is following the law
 
03:52:10.790 --> 03:52:10.800 align:start position:0%
then if then that would work but it
 
03:52:15.790 --> 03:52:15.800 align:start position:0%
often falls on the pharmacist so I guess
 
03:52:18.389 --> 03:52:18.399 align:start position:0%
the question would
 
03:52:21.469 --> 03:52:21.479 align:start position:0%
be you know is there any language that
 
03:52:23.790 --> 03:52:23.800 align:start position:0%
can go in there to make it so the doctor
 
03:52:25.630 --> 03:52:25.640 align:start position:0%
is the one
 
03:52:30.389 --> 03:52:30.399 align:start position:0%
that has to follow up on following that
 
03:52:32.830 --> 03:52:32.840 align:start position:0%
law yes thank you for the question I
 
03:52:36.030 --> 03:52:36.040 align:start position:0%
guess that's a level of detail that
 
03:52:39.910 --> 03:52:39.920 align:start position:0%
maybe I can't answer quite right um
 
03:52:42.710 --> 03:52:42.720 align:start position:0%
because you're right that this reads as
 
03:52:44.510 --> 03:52:44.520 align:start position:0%
though it's the pharmacist who's in
 
03:52:46.710 --> 03:52:46.720 align:start position:0%
charge right because it it says may be
 
03:52:49.070 --> 03:52:49.080 align:start position:0%
filled for a 90-day Supply it doesn't
 
03:52:52.110 --> 03:52:52.120 align:start position:0%
say may be written for a 90day supply
 
03:52:56.309 --> 03:52:56.319 align:start position:0%
right so so maybe this is a detail um
 
03:52:59.070 --> 03:52:59.080 align:start position:0%
that representative papovich Muller
 
03:53:01.309 --> 03:53:01.319 align:start position:0%
would have to maybe bring an amendment
 
03:53:06.309 --> 03:53:06.319 align:start position:0%
for you or something like that I I'm I'm
 
03:53:08.309 --> 03:53:08.319 align:start position:0%
not sure what I don't know whether he's
 
03:53:09.990 --> 03:53:10.000 align:start position:0%
thought about this or
 
03:53:12.030 --> 03:53:12.040 align:start position:0%
not representative
 
03:53:14.110 --> 03:53:14.120 align:start position:0%
mlan thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
03:53:16.189 --> 03:53:16.199 align:start position:0%
for taking my question you may have
 
03:53:17.750 --> 03:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
mentioned it in your testimony and I
 
03:53:21.630 --> 03:53:21.640 align:start position:0%
might have missed it but what was is why
 
03:53:26.189 --> 03:53:26.199 align:start position:0%
is the prior 12 months essential why not
 
03:53:28.149 --> 03:53:28.159 align:start position:0%
just go straight to
 
03:53:32.429 --> 03:53:32.439 align:start position:0%
the um the the 92 days yes thanks for
 
03:53:36.910 --> 03:53:36.920 align:start position:0%
the question so I think the whole point
 
03:53:42.070 --> 03:53:42.080 align:start position:0%
of this is to kind of avoid the the
 
03:53:45.030 --> 03:53:45.040 align:start position:0%
everybody's fear with prescription drugs
 
03:53:48.590 --> 03:53:48.600 align:start position:0%
is that patients will doctor shop and go
 
03:53:50.429 --> 03:53:50.439 align:start position:0%
here and get a prescription and then go
 
03:53:51.950 --> 03:53:51.960 align:start position:0%
there and get a prescription and then go
 
03:53:53.910 --> 03:53:53.920 align:start position:0%
over here and get the same prescription
 
03:53:55.469 --> 03:53:55.479 align:start position:0%
and all of a sudden they've got these
 
03:53:58.630 --> 03:53:58.640 align:start position:0%
dangerous drugs in way more volume than
 
03:54:01.110 --> 03:54:01.120 align:start position:0%
you know they they should right so I
 
03:54:03.670 --> 03:54:03.680 align:start position:0%
think the concept here is that you've
 
03:54:06.790 --> 03:54:06.800 align:start position:0%
been going to the same doctor for a year
 
03:54:09.070 --> 03:54:09.080 align:start position:0%
he's seen you for a long time you've
 
03:54:11.790 --> 03:54:11.800 align:start position:0%
gotten that one that those 12 one
 
03:54:13.910 --> 03:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
monthly prescriptions and so you're a
 
03:54:15.830 --> 03:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
regular person right I mean you're
 
03:54:18.110 --> 03:54:18.120 align:start position:0%
regular patient of this thing you're not
 
03:54:21.070 --> 03:54:21.080 align:start position:0%
somebody who's you know I'm here the
 
03:54:23.229 --> 03:54:23.239 align:start position:0%
first day and I all of a sudden I want
 
03:54:25.110 --> 03:54:25.120 align:start position:0%
this big
 
03:54:29.790 --> 03:54:29.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:34.149 --> 03:54:34.159 align:start position:0%
of any other questions and may may I add
 
03:54:36.910 --> 03:54:36.920 align:start position:0%
to that slightly the reason that wasn't
 
03:54:40.070 --> 03:54:40.080 align:start position:0%
an issue with the gel version is because
 
03:54:43.750 --> 03:54:43.760 align:start position:0%
the gel version is so weak that that a
 
03:54:43.760 --> 03:54:45.990 align:start position:0%
the gel version is so weak that that a
90day

03:54:45.990 --> 03:54:46.000 align:start position:0%
90day
 
03:54:48.510 --> 03:54:48.520 align:start position:0%
Supply is not a you know it doesn't
 
03:54:51.630 --> 03:54:51.640 align:start position:0%
build big muscles or whatever you see
 
03:54:55.149 --> 03:54:55.159 align:start position:0%
what I mean you know I I'm I'm a patient
 
03:54:58.910 --> 03:54:58.920 align:start position:0%
who uses the gel version and my doctor
 
03:55:01.670 --> 03:55:01.680 align:start position:0%
once made the made the comment to me
 
03:55:03.950 --> 03:55:03.960 align:start position:0%
that if you want to abuse this stuff you
 
03:55:06.429 --> 03:55:06.439 align:start position:0%
would need a bathtub full you
 
03:55:09.710 --> 03:55:09.720 align:start position:0%
know you know you know a couple of
 
03:55:11.990 --> 03:55:12.000 align:start position:0%
bottles isn't going to do it right and
 
03:55:14.349 --> 03:55:14.359 align:start position:0%
these are not cheap drugs I mean these
 
03:55:17.309 --> 03:55:17.319 align:start position:0%
are like uh you know technically the the
 
03:55:21.950 --> 03:55:21.960 align:start position:0%
bottle is $100 or more right so it's
 
03:55:24.990 --> 03:55:25.000 align:start position:0%
anyway any other
 
03:55:28.269 --> 03:55:28.279 align:start position:0%
questions I'm seeing Noone no no other
 
03:55:31.590 --> 03:55:31.600 align:start position:0%
representative did you have your hand
 
03:55:36.830 --> 03:55:36.840 align:start position:0%
up thank you for taking Mr chair and um
 
03:55:38.590 --> 03:55:38.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question which I
 
03:55:40.269 --> 03:55:40.279 align:start position:0%
don't know that much about this but it's
 
03:55:44.590 --> 03:55:44.600 align:start position:0%
part of it in order to monitor patients
 
03:55:47.790 --> 03:55:47.800 align:start position:0%
taking this injection for side effects
 
03:55:52.189 --> 03:55:52.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:56.389 --> 03:55:56.399 align:start position:0%
harmful um possibly but
 
03:55:59.149 --> 03:55:59.159 align:start position:0%
I that that's I guess that's beyond my
 
03:56:02.950 --> 03:56:02.960 align:start position:0%
knowledge I I I'm not a doctor so I I
 
03:56:05.990 --> 03:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
suppose it's possible but I I don't I
 
03:56:08.990 --> 03:56:09.000 align:start position:0%
don't think so I think it's more about
 
03:56:11.349 --> 03:56:11.359 align:start position:0%
the class of drug you know we have this
 
03:56:14.349 --> 03:56:14.359 align:start position:0%
system of certain drugs you just simply
 
03:56:16.990 --> 03:56:17.000 align:start position:0%
can't have some drugs you can get but
 
03:56:19.670 --> 03:56:19.680 align:start position:0%
only in the hospital some drugs you can
 
03:56:23.110 --> 03:56:23.120 align:start position:0%
get uh with a very short prescription
 
03:56:24.910 --> 03:56:24.920 align:start position:0%
other drugs you can get with a normal
 
03:56:26.590 --> 03:56:26.600 align:start position:0%
prescription and other things are over
 
03:56:27.750 --> 03:56:27.760 align:start position:0%
the counter you know what I mean so
 
03:56:29.990 --> 03:56:30.000 align:start position:0%
there's a classification system and I
 
03:56:32.309 --> 03:56:32.319 align:start position:0%
think it's just kind of where this
 
03:56:36.590 --> 03:56:36.600 align:start position:0%
particular one lands right I I I it's
 
03:56:39.910 --> 03:56:39.920 align:start position:0%
possible but I I don't think so i' I've
 
03:56:42.750 --> 03:56:42.760 align:start position:0%
never let me put it this way for my
 
03:56:45.030 --> 03:56:45.040 align:start position:0%
condition where I'm I've been given
 
03:56:47.269 --> 03:56:47.279 align:start position:0%
testosterone I've never had a doctor
 
03:56:50.269 --> 03:56:50.279 align:start position:0%
want to see me more than once a year
 
03:56:50.279 --> 03:56:51.189 align:start position:0%
want to see me more than once a year
right

03:56:51.189 --> 03:56:51.199 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:56:55.590 --> 03:56:55.600 align:start position:0%
so you know I mean it's it's a very slow
 
03:56:58.070 --> 03:56:58.080 align:start position:0%
moving kind of situation you know what I
 
03:57:00.670 --> 03:57:00.680 align:start position:0%
mean you see a very specialized doctor
 
03:57:03.870 --> 03:57:03.880 align:start position:0%
you see them once a year they say okay
 
03:57:06.950 --> 03:57:06.960 align:start position:0%
you know things are about the same and
 
03:57:09.630 --> 03:57:09.640 align:start position:0%
you know it's like
 
03:57:12.429 --> 03:57:12.439 align:start position:0%
that other
 
03:57:14.630 --> 03:57:14.640 align:start position:0%
questions I'm seeing no other questions
 
03:57:18.349 --> 03:57:18.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:20.830 --> 03:57:20.840 align:start position:0%
chairman and again the pink card don't
 
03:57:21.830 --> 03:57:21.840 align:start position:0%

03:57:25.309 --> 03:57:25.319 align:start position:0%
