minutes
 
00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:28.010 align:start position:0%

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 align:start position:0%
which which opens the question so what I
 
00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 align:start position:0%
mean if do we let's send everyone home
 
00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 align:start position:0%
or or do we just not just kind of Nod
 
00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 align:start position:0%
that the minutes look good to us and
 
00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:41.360 align:start position:0%
I've not been a stickler on that
 
00:04:46.249 --> 00:04:46.259 align:start position:0%
we can so we have exactly
 
00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 align:start position:0%
okay who can I swear chairman John
 
00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 align:start position:0%
Williams if I could just uh
 
00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 align:start position:0%
and you want to be a member for Quorum
 
00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 align:start position:0%
purposes not exactly uh chairman uh but
 
00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 align:start position:0%
what I wanted to bring to your attention
 
00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:01.199 align:start position:0%
you actually and under statute have
 
00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 align:start position:0%
eight members so the four plus one is
 
00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:06.360 align:start position:0%
five there are two alternates that serve
 
00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 align:start position:0%
uh on this committee as well is this
 
00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:12.060 align:start position:0%
your way of saying we have a quorum
 
00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:16.909 align:start position:0%
your way of saying we have a quorum
yes

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:16.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
take a look please at the Menace of the
 
00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:25.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:30.600 align:start position:0%
we have a second second thank you and I
 
00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:32.639 align:start position:0%
think we have kind of looked at them
 
00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
some of this that floated by us in email
 
00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:39.600 align:start position:0%
and I give a minute for anybody to
 
00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:47.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:51.720 align:start position:0%
may I you may okay so on at the very top
 
00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:53.880 align:start position:0%
of the second page it continues with
 
00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:55.860 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities inquired
 
00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:58.440 align:start position:0%
brain disorder and the bullet is the DD
 
00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:01.860 align:start position:0%
weightless I I I think there was a
 
00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:05.220 align:start position:0%
relevant discussion about continuing to
 
00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:07.560 align:start position:0%
expand upon the information shared with
 
00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:09.479 align:start position:0%
this committee relative to the real wait
 
00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:12.300 align:start position:0%
list and not just the the funded wait
 
00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:15.419 align:start position:0%
list we've we've had reported for quite
 
00:06:18.469 --> 00:06:18.479 align:start position:0%
some time that we fully funded the DD
 
00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:21.360 align:start position:0%
waitlist and have a zero but then we'd
 
00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:23.100 align:start position:0%
like to really start to get into the
 
00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
details of of of of what the reality is
 
00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:28.620 align:start position:0%
about having service providers
 
00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:31.500 align:start position:0%
connecting with clients and and so that
 
00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:33.840 align:start position:0%
so that's kind of missing in there and I
 
00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:35.880 align:start position:0%
don't know if it's worth opening the
 
00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
minutes up again but I just I don't want
 
00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:40.680 align:start position:0%
to lose track of the fact that we
 
00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:43.800 align:start position:0%
have been requesting details
 
00:06:47.469 --> 00:06:47.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:50.220 align:start position:0%
it's no no problem opening them back up
 
00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:51.170 align:start position:0%
it's no no problem opening them back up
again

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:51.180 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:52.740 align:start position:0%
um just wouldn't print them out before
 
00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
the the meeting of course so
 
00:06:57.770 --> 00:06:57.780 align:start position:0%
um how does how do you want me to work
 
00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:00.240 align:start position:0%
that continuing conversation about uh
 
00:07:02.749 --> 00:07:02.759 align:start position:0%
fully funded I think we could just keep
 
00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:05.160 align:start position:0%
it simple and add a second pull it under
 
00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:07.080 align:start position:0%
DD waitlist I mean this is me it's the
 
00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:09.600 align:start position:0%
Chairman's call but I I I I think it
 
00:07:13.129 --> 00:07:13.139 align:start position:0%
would be adequate to just say that
 
00:07:17.029 --> 00:07:17.039 align:start position:0%
um the uh the the the the the the that
 
00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:18.780 align:start position:0%
the committee continues to voice
 
00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:20.660 align:start position:0%
interest in receiving
 
00:07:24.469 --> 00:07:24.479 align:start position:0%
details on
 
00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:28.440 align:start position:0%
the actual wait list you could actually
 
00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:31.800 align:start position:0%
say funded positions versus filters yeah
 
00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:35.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:38.280 align:start position:0%
no I I don't I don't I don't I don't
 
00:07:41.029 --> 00:07:41.039 align:start position:0%
know if it's as clear as it was whether
 
00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:43.740 align:start position:0%
they're funded or filled but I I said I
 
00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:46.460 align:start position:0%
said versus yeah we know what fun it is
 
00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:48.780 align:start position:0%
just because we funded them doesn't mean
 
00:07:50.029 --> 00:07:50.039 align:start position:0%
that there's a person actually
 
00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
delivering these Services because we've
 
00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:53.940 align:start position:0%
got a provider from and that's kind of
 
00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:55.800 align:start position:0%
the rub I thought that was what your
 
00:07:58.309 --> 00:07:58.319 align:start position:0%
well that that is a waypoint to where
 
00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:01.080 align:start position:0%
I'm going yes ma'am I I just am also
 
00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:04.500 align:start position:0%
hoping that eventually we get beyond the
 
00:08:06.290 --> 00:08:06.300 align:start position:0%
the whether or not we have the case
 
00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:08.460 align:start position:0%
managers working the cases but the
 
00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:10.800 align:start position:0%
actually get to the provider level
 
00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:13.380 align:start position:0%
so like let's say you've got somebody on
 
00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:15.620 align:start position:0%
the DD waitlist that needs five services
 
00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:18.240 align:start position:0%
and two of them are being met but the
 
00:08:20.089 --> 00:08:20.099 align:start position:0%
other three are not because the humans
 
00:08:23.809 --> 00:08:23.819 align:start position:0%
don't exist uh in that area I I I would
 
00:08:25.249 --> 00:08:25.259 align:start position:0%
hope that we're we're trying to
 
00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:28.680 align:start position:0%
aggregate that kind of data so that we
 
00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:30.300 align:start position:0%
can get a view that's that's really
 
00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:31.800 align:start position:0%
where I'm going
 
00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:35.640 align:start position:0%
but if you just made that a bullet I I'd
 
00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:38.580 align:start position:0%
be happy to just defer how you write
 
00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:40.500 align:start position:0%
that to you and we can still approve
 
00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:43.200 align:start position:0%
these minutes with that change I I think
 
00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:49.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:55.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:57.590 --> 00:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
it funded but however the court feels
 
00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:01.160 align:start position:0%
most comfortable is running in Dallas
 
00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
so I'd like to move that we accept the
 
00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:06.060 align:start position:0%
minutes with the contingent upon the
 
00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:08.220 align:start position:0%
clerk writing and trusting the clerk to
 
00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:11.160 align:start position:0%
make sense out of what was just said
 
00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:12.710 align:start position:0%
make sense out of what was just said
yeah

00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:12.720 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:17.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:18.420 align:start position:0%
all in favor
 
00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:20.880 align:start position:0%
aye aye opposed
 
00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:25.080 align:start position:0%
now um and they children up my spine
 
00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:27.480 align:start position:0%
recently when I learned that there was
 
00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:32.940 align:start position:0%
in fact a standing subcommittee on
 
00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:34.620 align:start position:0%
um Alzheimer's disease it's a bigger
 
00:09:37.009 --> 00:09:37.019 align:start position:0%
title than that that that is out of this
 
00:09:38.329 --> 00:09:38.339 align:start position:0%
committee and I've been chairman for
 
00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:41.060 align:start position:0%
three years and I never heard of it and
 
00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:44.160 align:start position:0%
sometimes things go into a bands and we
 
00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:46.800 align:start position:0%
can always blame either the cat or kovid
 
00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:49.500 align:start position:0%
when something goes wrong so since then
 
00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:51.660 align:start position:0%
I've been brought up to speed and I
 
00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:53.940 align:start position:0%
would just like about oh maybe five
 
00:09:58.490 --> 00:09:58.500 align:start position:0%
minutes to get before all of us what
 
00:10:02.389 --> 00:10:02.399 align:start position:0%
this special subcommittee is about the
 
00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:06.720 align:start position:0%
amendment that's been produced and where
 
00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:08.040 align:start position:0%
we go from there so we'll certain
 
00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:11.580 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards uh thank you Mr
 
00:10:14.329 --> 00:10:14.339 align:start position:0%
chair I think the thing that stimulated
 
00:10:17.509 --> 00:10:17.519 align:start position:0%
the observation that we were supposed to
 
00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:19.800 align:start position:0%
have this subcommittee and and it did
 
00:10:23.329 --> 00:10:23.339 align:start position:0%
not exist was an initial initiative and
 
00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:27.720 align:start position:0%
hp2 by Senator avard working with a
 
00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:29.580 align:start position:0%
couple of lobbyists that are with us
 
00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:30.970 align:start position:0%
couple of lobbyists that are with us
today

00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:30.980 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
Tom and Jess and they have really great
 
00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:36.240 align:start position:0%
last names if I would remember them but
 
00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:40.680 align:start position:0%
but so so they have been supporting an
 
00:10:44.389 --> 00:10:44.399 align:start position:0%
initiative to write an hb2 item saying
 
00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:46.980 align:start position:0%
that we wanted to invest a half a
 
00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:48.720 align:start position:0%
million dollars in the coming budget
 
00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:51.240 align:start position:0%
cycle so that we could develop a public
 
00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:54.240 align:start position:0%
awareness campaign specifically to help
 
00:10:56.210 --> 00:10:56.220 align:start position:0%
with Alzheimer's and other memory
 
00:10:59.630 --> 00:10:59.640 align:start position:0%
related issues and to take it through
 
00:11:03.829 --> 00:11:03.839 align:start position:0%
Miss Hardy's department and um in the in
 
00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:07.760 align:start position:0%
a branch related to Wendy Altman's
 
00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:10.680 align:start position:0%
elderly Affairs I'm not getting the
 
00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:12.800 align:start position:0%
title exactly right but
 
00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:16.920 align:start position:0%
but so this is a new initiative the
 
00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:18.720 align:start position:0%
department is recognized the need to
 
00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:20.640 align:start position:0%
develop some materials to help the
 
00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:22.980 align:start position:0%
public understand the importance of
 
00:11:26.530 --> 00:11:26.540 align:start position:0%
things like going and getting a the
 
00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:28.389 align:start position:0%
things like going and getting a the
Medicare

00:11:28.389 --> 00:11:28.399 align:start position:0%
Medicare
 
00:11:30.829 --> 00:11:30.839 align:start position:0%
testing going through the Medicare
 
00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:33.540 align:start position:0%
testing program to to start to Benchmark
 
00:11:35.569 --> 00:11:35.579 align:start position:0%
and evaluate changes in cognitive
 
00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:39.180 align:start position:0%
abilities and other things and their
 
00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:40.920 align:start position:0%
half a million dollar appropriation and
 
00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:43.800 align:start position:0%
in their effort to find stakeholders to
 
00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
coordinate this public awareness
 
00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
campaign with they wanted to interact
 
00:11:51.829 --> 00:11:51.839 align:start position:0%
with the subcommittee that's supposed to
 
00:11:54.350 --> 00:11:54.360 align:start position:0%
be part of this oversight committee and
 
00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:56.160 align:start position:0%
that's what the chairman is referring to
 
00:11:58.670 --> 00:11:58.680 align:start position:0%
a subcommittee that that has not been
 
00:12:02.509 --> 00:12:02.519 align:start position:0%
appointed in in the recent memory so
 
00:12:05.569 --> 00:12:05.579 align:start position:0%
um so it would be my recommendation that
 
00:12:07.329 --> 00:12:07.339 align:start position:0%
the chair consider
 
00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:11.600 align:start position:0%
at least doing a a partial
 
00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:14.180 align:start position:0%
delegation and an establishment
 
00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:16.920 align:start position:0%
re-establishment of this subcommittee
 
00:12:19.850 --> 00:12:19.860 align:start position:0%
just so that there's at least a connect
 
00:12:23.090 --> 00:12:23.100 align:start position:0%
point for the hb2 item and the
 
00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
stakeholders so that there's someone who
 
00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:28.920 align:start position:0%
pick up the phone from oversight
 
00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:32.160 align:start position:0%
the chairman has actually begun that and
 
00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:36.180 align:start position:0%
going back to chapter 126 Dash a colon
 
00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
15 Dash small a the subcommittee on
 
00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:41.700 align:start position:0%
Alzheimer's disease and other related
 
00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:44.660 align:start position:0%
dementia we have all of these wonderful
 
00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:47.300 align:start position:0%
people who are supposed to be appointed
 
00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:50.240 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:12:53.210 --> 00:12:53.220 align:start position:0%
Argyle Miss escaland
 
00:12:56.629 --> 00:12:56.639 align:start position:0%
has been on this and contacting people
 
00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:02.160 align:start position:0%
and making recommendations and uh wow so
 
00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
thank you would you would you folks like
 
00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:04.920 align:start position:0%
to come on up and say a few words
 
00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
because we've got this chapter 126 uh I
 
00:13:12.650 --> 00:13:12.660 align:start position:0%
think you all should have one
 
00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:14.760 align:start position:0%
well they're coming up I will say but I
 
00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:16.680 align:start position:0%
was the immediate fast chair before you
 
00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
and I didn't know about it either
 
00:13:20.269 --> 00:13:20.279 align:start position:0%
so that gives us five years of
 
00:13:23.329 --> 00:13:23.339 align:start position:0%
restriction wow
 
00:13:24.829 --> 00:13:24.839 align:start position:0%
well thank you Mr chairman for the
 
00:13:26.449 --> 00:13:26.459 align:start position:0%
record my name is Tom prasall from
 
00:13:29.050 --> 00:13:29.060 align:start position:0%
Demers and praisal we represent the
 
00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
Alzheimer's Association my name is
 
00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:33.600 align:start position:0%
Jessica escalind I'm the senior public
 
00:13:35.389 --> 00:13:35.399 align:start position:0%
policy manager for the Alzheimer's
 
00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
association's New Hampshire chapter
 
00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:41.820 align:start position:0%
and so this initiative as was discussed
 
00:13:43.850 --> 00:13:43.860 align:start position:0%
uh was brought forward it was brought to
 
00:13:45.889 --> 00:13:45.899 align:start position:0%
my attention by Tom that this existed in
 
00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:48.240 align:start position:0%
statute and it seemed I know that
 
00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:49.800 align:start position:0%
previous legislation had come through
 
00:13:51.170 --> 00:13:51.180 align:start position:0%
that subcommittee that was able to
 
00:13:53.389 --> 00:13:53.399 align:start position:0%
really do a deep dive and take a look at
 
00:13:55.009 --> 00:13:55.019 align:start position:0%
these issues and had come up with some
 
00:13:57.949 --> 00:13:57.959 align:start position:0%
really positive policy in the past due
 
00:14:00.650 --> 00:14:00.660 align:start position:0%
to some vacancies and staff turnover in
 
00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:03.060 align:start position:0%
my position as well as then subsequently
 
00:14:05.389 --> 00:14:05.399 align:start position:0%
coveted it sounds like as the chair said
 
00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:07.560 align:start position:0%
this was sort of held in advance and
 
00:14:09.050 --> 00:14:09.060 align:start position:0%
this is something that we're eager to
 
00:14:11.329 --> 00:14:11.339 align:start position:0%
revive to look at this issue that's
 
00:14:13.250 --> 00:14:13.260 align:start position:0%
becoming even more prevalent of an issue
 
00:14:15.410 --> 00:14:15.420 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire so
 
00:14:18.530 --> 00:14:18.540 align:start position:0%
um happy to be a resource help organize
 
00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
as we discussed in any way that is that
 
00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:22.980 align:start position:0%
is helpful but that's really what we're
 
00:14:24.290 --> 00:14:24.300 align:start position:0%
looking to do and as representative
 
00:14:26.329 --> 00:14:26.339 align:start position:0%
Edwards said they are named as a
 
00:14:28.069 --> 00:14:28.079 align:start position:0%
stakeholder in that language in House
 
00:14:30.410 --> 00:14:30.420 align:start position:0%
Bill 2 just to have
 
00:14:32.090 --> 00:14:32.100 align:start position:0%
um more oversight more engagement with
 
00:14:33.769 --> 00:14:33.779 align:start position:0%
the legislature and folks charged with
 
00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:36.120 align:start position:0%
looking at these issues I do have a
 
00:14:39.470 --> 00:14:39.480 align:start position:0%
question in that a memo to me of the
 
00:14:44.269 --> 00:14:44.279 align:start position:0%
22nd of February on Senate Bill 234 FNA
 
00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
an act directing the Department of
 
00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:48.720 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services to develop the
 
00:14:52.189 --> 00:14:52.199 align:start position:0%
campaign and then the aforementioned
 
00:14:55.689 --> 00:14:55.699 align:start position:0%
chapter law about the subcommittee
 
00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:02.240 align:start position:0%
is it true does anyone know has that
 
00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 234 been folded into the
 
00:15:06.170 --> 00:15:06.180 align:start position:0%
trailer bill
 
00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:10.740 align:start position:0%
it has it has yeah okay so um not in its
 
00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:12.240 align:start position:0%
original version we had worked with
 
00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards I know he had
 
00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:15.540 align:start position:0%
shared language that we had arrived at
 
00:15:17.569 --> 00:15:17.579 align:start position:0%
uh through discussion with him and with
 
00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:19.620 align:start position:0%
the great Folks at HHS to get to
 
00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:21.300 align:start position:0%
language that um everyone was
 
00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
comfortable with so it maintains the
 
00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:25.320 align:start position:0%
original Spirit of the bill but with
 
00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:28.320 align:start position:0%
much more specifics and adding that the
 
00:15:31.069 --> 00:15:31.079 align:start position:0%
appropriation would since sunset in 25.
 
00:15:33.410 --> 00:15:33.420 align:start position:0%
so the program part of it is in the
 
00:15:35.269 --> 00:15:35.279 align:start position:0%
trailer bill but the establishment of
 
00:15:38.050 --> 00:15:38.060 align:start position:0%
the commission is already in law correct
 
00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:41.820 align:start position:0%
so you have been doing due diligence to
 
00:15:44.629 --> 00:15:44.639 align:start position:0%
find these various representatives to
 
00:15:47.449 --> 00:15:47.459 align:start position:0%
fill all these slots yes uh that you
 
00:15:48.829 --> 00:15:48.839 align:start position:0%
really appreciates that because I do
 
00:15:52.610 --> 00:15:52.620 align:start position:0%
that job sometimes and uh thank you also
 
00:15:56.030 --> 00:15:56.040 align:start position:0%
for our purposes
 
00:15:58.790 --> 00:15:58.800 align:start position:0%
um Pat long representative Pat long had
 
00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:02.760 align:start position:0%
chaired this at one point and I would
 
00:16:04.370 --> 00:16:04.380 align:start position:0%
like to give him first right of refusal
 
00:16:05.750 --> 00:16:05.760 align:start position:0%
if he'd like to pick this up and run
 
00:16:08.509 --> 00:16:08.519 align:start position:0%
with it again he's got the experience uh
 
00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:10.260 align:start position:0%
we're not bringing Don LeBron out of
 
00:16:12.410 --> 00:16:12.420 align:start position:0%
retirement to do it so I think um
 
00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:14.880 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards would be excuse
 
00:16:17.329 --> 00:16:17.339 align:start position:0%
me representative long would be
 
00:16:20.269 --> 00:16:20.279 align:start position:0%
wonderful and we'll be in touch with him
 
00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
and go from there anything else before
 
00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
we move on I I would I would just say
 
00:16:26.689 --> 00:16:26.699 align:start position:0%
that if for whatever reason
 
00:16:29.810 --> 00:16:29.820 align:start position:0%
representative long uh is not interested
 
00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:33.240 align:start position:0%
in doing it I'd be happy to to be the
 
00:16:37.249 --> 00:16:37.259 align:start position:0%
rep I've now gotten dirty enough with
 
00:16:39.829 --> 00:16:39.839 align:start position:0%
the issue that I I would know kind of
 
00:16:41.269 --> 00:16:41.279 align:start position:0%
where we should go well that's what I
 
00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:42.720 align:start position:0%
thought as soon as you first sent me
 
00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:43.670 align:start position:0%
thought as soon as you first sent me
that

00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:43.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:45.230 align:start position:0%
that
draft

00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:45.240 align:start position:0%
draft
 
00:16:47.509 --> 00:16:47.519 align:start position:0%
Senate thing that
 
00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:50.220 align:start position:0%
yeah okay sure if I can just make a
 
00:16:52.370 --> 00:16:52.380 align:start position:0%
quick comment about some of the work uh
 
00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
the past work that the permanent
 
00:16:56.269 --> 00:16:56.279 align:start position:0%
subcommittee has done it's developed a
 
00:16:58.670 --> 00:16:58.680 align:start position:0%
state plan for the state for Alzheimer's
 
00:17:01.129 --> 00:17:01.139 align:start position:0%
and Dementia training they worked on
 
00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
creating a silver alert program for if
 
00:17:07.370 --> 00:17:07.380 align:start position:0%
someone wanders or is missing and they
 
00:17:10.490 --> 00:17:10.500 align:start position:0%
also worked on language to create some
 
00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:12.240 align:start position:0%
dementia training
 
00:17:14.569 --> 00:17:14.579 align:start position:0%
um do you have
 
00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:18.240 align:start position:0%
that in your possession somehow I can
 
00:17:20.329 --> 00:17:20.339 align:start position:0%
find their legislation it's legislation
 
00:17:22.429 --> 00:17:22.439 align:start position:0%
that has come through and passed uh if
 
00:17:25.730 --> 00:17:25.740 align:start position:0%
you if you've got that those documents
 
00:17:27.289 --> 00:17:27.299 align:start position:0%
would be helpful at least for the chair
 
00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:29.580 align:start position:0%
to have that in the folder on this and
 
00:17:32.090 --> 00:17:32.100 align:start position:0%
if it's electronic you could send it to
 
00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:34.200 align:start position:0%
all of us and those of us who wish to
 
00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:35.880 align:start position:0%
could read it it's just the way getting
 
00:17:38.289 --> 00:17:38.299 align:start position:0%
up to speed absolutely thank you so much
 
00:17:40.789 --> 00:17:40.799 align:start position:0%
representative Weber great deal of
 
00:17:44.029 --> 00:17:44.039 align:start position:0%
discussion in one term about a bill that
 
00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:48.780 align:start position:0%
was uh training on Dementia or Personnel
 
00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:51.900 align:start position:0%
at nursing homes and my recollection was
 
00:17:53.630 --> 00:17:53.640 align:start position:0%
that the discussion
 
00:17:56.270 --> 00:17:56.280 align:start position:0%
was not so much with respect to the
 
00:17:57.950 --> 00:17:57.960 align:start position:0%
professionals who worked at nursing
 
00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:00.360 align:start position:0%
homes but having the the rest of the
 
00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:03.960 align:start position:0%
Personnel understand the different ways
 
00:18:05.930 --> 00:18:05.940 align:start position:0%
that people with dementia need to be
 
00:18:07.789 --> 00:18:07.799 align:start position:0%
related to and so there's a lot of
 
00:18:09.470 --> 00:18:09.480 align:start position:0%
discussion about whether the brownish
 
00:18:10.970 --> 00:18:10.980 align:start position:0%
people had to be trained or what the
 
00:18:15.710 --> 00:18:15.720 align:start position:0%
books had to be trained so but but is
 
00:18:17.870 --> 00:18:17.880 align:start position:0%
that the one that was one of the the
 
00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:20.400 align:start position:0%
bills that kind of came out of this uh
 
00:18:22.789 --> 00:18:22.799 align:start position:0%
permanent subcommittee and it looks like
 
00:18:25.310 --> 00:18:25.320 align:start position:0%
we have to file legislation by September
 
00:18:29.029 --> 00:18:29.039 align:start position:0%
this fall one week in September some of
 
00:18:31.370 --> 00:18:31.380 align:start position:0%
us voted for two but
 
00:18:34.490 --> 00:18:34.500 align:start position:0%
so if we can have this soon or not later
 
00:18:36.409 --> 00:18:36.419 align:start position:0%
because if there is more legislation
 
00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:38.460 align:start position:0%
that maybe needs to be forthcoming we
 
00:18:40.070 --> 00:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
want to hit the ground on that by that
 
00:18:42.590 --> 00:18:42.600 align:start position:0%
date representative Merchant thank you
 
00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:44.029 align:start position:0%
date representative Merchant thank you
Mr

00:18:44.029 --> 00:18:44.039 align:start position:0%
Mr
 
00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:46.440 align:start position:0%
I think this is a good step going
 
00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:50.760 align:start position:0%
forward what I find missing is that drug
 
00:18:53.330 --> 00:18:53.340 align:start position:0%
therapy is a second part of trading
 
00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:54.409 align:start position:0%
therapy is a second part of trading
Alzheimer's

00:18:54.409 --> 00:18:54.419 align:start position:0%
Alzheimer's
 
00:18:55.970 --> 00:18:55.980 align:start position:0%
yet there's no pharmacists on this
 
00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:57.169 align:start position:0%
yet there's no pharmacists on this
Commission

00:18:57.169 --> 00:18:57.179 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
00:19:00.049 --> 00:19:00.059 align:start position:0%
so the commission was draft uh
 
00:19:02.450 --> 00:19:02.460 align:start position:0%
established back in 2014 when I don't
 
00:19:04.549 --> 00:19:04.559 align:start position:0%
I'm still a pharmacist on the commission
 
00:19:07.130 --> 00:19:07.140 align:start position:0%
yeah well if you look so how would you
 
00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:08.289 align:start position:0%
yeah well if you look so how would you
legislative

00:19:08.289 --> 00:19:08.299 align:start position:0%
legislative
 
00:19:10.730 --> 00:19:10.740 align:start position:0%
put it there thank you
 
00:19:12.610 --> 00:19:12.620 align:start position:0%
I mean that's the only way you can
 
00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:16.440 align:start position:0%
change this because thank you but as
 
00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
they meet if you know anyone that would
 
00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:19.260 align:start position:0%
like to participate obviously it's open
 
00:19:21.049 --> 00:19:21.059 align:start position:0%
to the public and their input would be
 
00:19:23.029 --> 00:19:23.039 align:start position:0%
invaluable I may know one
 
00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:26.480 align:start position:0%
some Mr chair representative Edwards
 
00:19:30.169 --> 00:19:30.179 align:start position:0%
since the topic was open on potential
 
00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:34.160 align:start position:0%
legislative future of uh section 126
 
00:19:38.029 --> 00:19:38.039 align:start position:0%
a15a uh thinking that this hasn't
 
00:19:40.130 --> 00:19:40.140 align:start position:0%
operated in five years and the
 
00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:42.840 align:start position:0%
legislature is still functioning uh I
 
00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:44.640 align:start position:0%
I'd be thinking that we should scale
 
00:19:46.490 --> 00:19:46.500 align:start position:0%
this back or be thinking about
 
00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:49.740 align:start position:0%
eliminating it but for the fact that it
 
00:19:53.169 --> 00:19:53.179 align:start position:0%
has an apparent task in the near future
 
00:19:55.730 --> 00:19:55.740 align:start position:0%
relative to helping with the particular
 
00:19:58.549 --> 00:19:58.559 align:start position:0%
public awareness campaign and and I I'd
 
00:20:00.770 --> 00:20:00.780 align:start position:0%
be thinking more about legislation that
 
00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:04.260 align:start position:0%
would sunset this and to expand it but I
 
00:20:05.930 --> 00:20:05.940 align:start position:0%
would suggest to any of us because we do
 
00:20:08.150 --> 00:20:08.160 align:start position:0%
need to move on I would suggest that
 
00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:10.320 align:start position:0%
anybody who has any ideas on how to
 
00:20:13.370 --> 00:20:13.380 align:start position:0%
change the law as it exists by adding or
 
00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:15.960 align:start position:0%
taking away you Talk Amongst various
 
00:20:19.810 --> 00:20:19.820 align:start position:0%
people who have some history with this
 
00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:23.580 align:start position:0%
representative long whomever the
 
00:20:26.990 --> 00:20:27.000 align:start position:0%
associations and informally Talk Amongst

September we don't have much time if we
 
00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:33.200 align:start position:0%
want to do something
 
00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
representative King this is a I hope
 
00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:38.520 align:start position:0%

we also do have another meeting on the
 
00:21:06.890 --> 00:21:06.900 align:start position:0%
fourth Friday of June before we go into
 
00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
summer Hiatus so if people want to be
 
00:21:12.169 --> 00:21:12.179 align:start position:0%
busy and talk amongst themselves we
 
00:21:14.570 --> 00:21:14.580 align:start position:0%
could put that into the agenda going
 
00:21:16.610 --> 00:21:16.620 align:start position:0%
forward over the summer we can have a
 
00:21:19.669 --> 00:21:19.679 align:start position:0%

um we squoze this one in because it
 
00:21:33.649 --> 00:21:33.659 align:start position:0%
looked sudden and topical and now we
 
00:21:37.010 --> 00:21:37.020 align:start position:0%
have our monthly time with the
 
00:21:40.010 --> 00:21:40.020 align:start position:0%

foreign

00:21:53.409 --> 00:21:53.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:56.870 --> 00:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
good afternoon thank you that was stuff
 
00:21:59.330 --> 00:21:59.340 align:start position:0%
up here I know
 
00:22:04.610 --> 00:22:04.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:07.370 --> 00:22:07.380 align:start position:0%
so I thought I would
 
00:22:11.149 --> 00:22:11.159 align:start position:0%
shape my updates for you today around
 
00:22:14.029 --> 00:22:14.039 align:start position:0%
um our mission zero some of you may or
 
00:22:15.770 --> 00:22:15.780 align:start position:0%
may not know that as of this morning
 
00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
well it is mental health awareness month
 
00:22:20.510 --> 00:22:20.520 align:start position:0%
or month of May and this morning the
 
00:22:22.789 --> 00:22:22.799 align:start position:0%
department has announced its uh Mission
 
00:22:26.510 --> 00:22:26.520 align:start position:0%
zero which basically is our effort to
 
00:22:29.630 --> 00:22:29.640 align:start position:0%
reduce the Ed wait list of boarding and
 
00:22:32.149 --> 00:22:32.159 align:start position:0%
bring that number down to zero the team
 
00:22:33.890 --> 00:22:33.900 align:start position:0%
the behavioral team at the department
 
00:22:36.010 --> 00:22:36.020 align:start position:0%
including myself has been working
 
00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:38.400 align:start position:0%
steadfast over the last several months
 
00:22:40.850 --> 00:22:40.860 align:start position:0%
to really analyze the factors that it
 
00:22:42.409 --> 00:22:42.419 align:start position:0%
would take to do that and there were
 
00:22:46.370 --> 00:22:46.380 align:start position:0%
three key drivers that I will shape my
 
00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:48.720 align:start position:0%
updates around and those drivers are the
 
00:22:51.409 --> 00:22:51.419 align:start position:0%
front door issues they're inpatient
 
00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
Supply and coordination issues and
 
00:22:55.190 --> 00:22:55.200 align:start position:0%
backdoor issues and we may have heard
 
00:22:57.110 --> 00:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
some of these in terms of the front door
 
00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:58.570 align:start position:0%
some of these in terms of the front door
issues

00:22:58.570 --> 00:22:58.580 align:start position:0%
issues
 
00:23:02.450 --> 00:23:02.460 align:start position:0%
sure inpatient Supply and coordination
 
00:23:04.970 --> 00:23:04.980 align:start position:0%
services and I'll go through each one of
 
00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:06.840 align:start position:0%
them but in terms of the front door
 
00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
you've heard me here and others front
 
00:23:11.990 --> 00:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
door is the most obvious where do people
 
00:23:13.970 --> 00:23:13.980 align:start position:0%
go when they're in terms of distress and
 
00:23:16.610 --> 00:23:16.620 align:start position:0%
need that high level of care needing
 
00:23:18.830 --> 00:23:18.840 align:start position:0%
some designated receiving facility beds
 
00:23:22.010 --> 00:23:22.020 align:start position:0%
commonly called drf beds so we've had a
 
00:23:23.270 --> 00:23:23.280 align:start position:0%
contract with solution Health we're
 
00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
going to be building a hospital with a
 
00:23:27.649 --> 00:23:27.659 align:start position:0%
total of 120 Dr foot beds that's going
 
00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:30.000 align:start position:0%
to be coming online at the I think end
 
00:23:32.149 --> 00:23:32.159 align:start position:0%
of 25 beginning of 26th we have
 
00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:33.960 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth Health that we've contracted
 
00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:36.480 align:start position:0%
with for five additional drf beds that
 
00:23:39.529 --> 00:23:39.539 align:start position:0%
should come online I Believe by the end
 
00:23:41.289 --> 00:23:41.299 align:start position:0%
of this calendar year beginning up next
 
00:23:44.330 --> 00:23:44.340 align:start position:0%
we have New Hampshire hospital has 31
 
00:23:48.350 --> 00:23:48.360 align:start position:0%
beds offline but however Wednesday at
 
00:23:50.570 --> 00:23:50.580 align:start position:0%
Council we have a contract passed to
 
00:23:53.450 --> 00:23:53.460 align:start position:0%
finally begin the renovation of E and F
 
00:23:56.570 --> 00:23:56.580 align:start position:0%
unit as we know it today enf unit was
 
00:23:58.430 --> 00:23:58.440 align:start position:0%
significantly impacted by flooding as
 
00:24:01.070 --> 00:24:01.080 align:start position:0%
well because that's just the way it goes
 
00:24:03.770 --> 00:24:03.780 align:start position:0%
with good luck or bad luck and so we not
 
00:24:05.330 --> 00:24:05.340 align:start position:0%
only do we have to renovate we have to
 
00:24:07.669 --> 00:24:07.679 align:start position:0%
mitigate I was in the facility last week
 
00:24:09.770 --> 00:24:09.780 align:start position:0%
touring and I was actually quite taken
 
00:24:11.690 --> 00:24:11.700 align:start position:0%
aback by the level of water damage
 
00:24:13.669 --> 00:24:13.679 align:start position:0%
needless to say there's a lot of work to
 
00:24:15.409 --> 00:24:15.419 align:start position:0%
be done there and it is beginning so
 
00:24:16.970 --> 00:24:16.980 align:start position:0%
that is great news and we're looking for
 
00:24:18.770 --> 00:24:18.780 align:start position:0%
that to come online at the end of this
 
00:24:20.029 --> 00:24:20.039 align:start position:0%
calendar year
 
00:24:20.039 --> 00:24:21.850 align:start position:0%
calendar year

00:24:21.850 --> 00:24:21.860 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:24:25.610 --> 00:24:25.620 align:start position:0%
e slash F so e so a b c d e we name our
 
00:24:27.169 --> 00:24:27.179 align:start position:0%
units like the letter of the alphabet
 
00:24:30.289 --> 00:24:30.299 align:start position:0%
yeah so EF yep that's an easy one I can
 
00:24:32.289 --> 00:24:32.299 align:start position:0%
spell that one
 
00:24:34.250 --> 00:24:34.260 align:start position:0%
so that would be just that's how we
 
00:24:35.810 --> 00:24:35.820 align:start position:0%
coordinate them
 
00:24:37.789 --> 00:24:37.799 align:start position:0%
that's New Hampshire Hospital enf unit
 
00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
yes and there's been a lot of discussion
 
00:24:41.870 --> 00:24:41.880 align:start position:0%
about those beds being offline and part
 
00:24:43.850 --> 00:24:43.860 align:start position:0%
of it uh has been this renovation that
 
00:24:46.610 --> 00:24:46.620 align:start position:0%
will finally happen which is wonderful
 
00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
um being bringing some beds that will
 
00:24:50.029 --> 00:24:50.039 align:start position:0%
address some of our front door issues
 
00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:52.200 align:start position:0%
and we are also bringing online services
 
00:24:54.289 --> 00:24:54.299 align:start position:0%
that are called crisis stabilization
 
00:24:57.169 --> 00:24:57.179 align:start position:0%
centers so those are going to be centers
 
00:24:58.909 --> 00:24:58.919 align:start position:0%
in the community related with our
 
00:25:00.169 --> 00:25:00.179 align:start position:0%
community mental health centers that
 
00:25:02.149 --> 00:25:02.159 align:start position:0%
will basically be places for people to
 
00:25:04.190 --> 00:25:04.200 align:start position:0%
go other than the emergency room they
 
00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:06.840 align:start position:0%
will see people up to 23 hours it's not
 
00:25:09.950 --> 00:25:09.960 align:start position:0%
a it's not a bed per se but it is a
 
00:25:12.169 --> 00:25:12.179 align:start position:0%
crisis stabilization where folks can get
 
00:25:14.029 --> 00:25:14.039 align:start position:0%
services and if they need continued
 
00:25:16.130 --> 00:25:16.140 align:start position:0%
Services after that for Ed they can and
 
00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:17.880 align:start position:0%
then if not they may need a lesser level
 
00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:20.520 align:start position:0%
of care so we're really focusing in on
 
00:25:22.010 --> 00:25:22.020 align:start position:0%
the front door but as we all know it's
 
00:25:23.810 --> 00:25:23.820 align:start position:0%
not just the front door it's also the
 
00:25:25.250 --> 00:25:25.260 align:start position:0%
back door I'm just going to skip to the
 
00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:27.240 align:start position:0%
back door first before I get to
 
00:25:29.330 --> 00:25:29.340 align:start position:0%
inpatient Supply so when we think about
 
00:25:31.490 --> 00:25:31.500 align:start position:0%
all the folks that we have currently and
 
00:25:32.570 --> 00:25:32.580 align:start position:0%
I'll just talk about New Hampshire
 
00:25:34.789 --> 00:25:34.799 align:start position:0%
hospital we have patients there
 
00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:36.600 align:start position:0%
currently today that don't need that
 
00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:38.640 align:start position:0%
level of care and they have nowhere to
 
00:25:40.750 --> 00:25:40.760 align:start position:0%
go to so now we have
 
00:25:43.370 --> 00:25:43.380 align:start position:0%
folks that may have stabilized and don't
 
00:25:45.049 --> 00:25:45.059 align:start position:0%
have transitional housing Supportive
 
00:25:46.970 --> 00:25:46.980 align:start position:0%
Housing or step-down care so the
 
00:25:48.529 --> 00:25:48.539 align:start position:0%
department is focusing on adding
 
00:25:50.690 --> 00:25:50.700 align:start position:0%
traditional transitional housing beds
 
00:25:52.909 --> 00:25:52.919 align:start position:0%
step down care as well as landlord
 
00:25:55.130 --> 00:25:55.140 align:start position:0%
incentives programs so the department
 
00:25:57.890 --> 00:25:57.900 align:start position:0%
will be focusing on that legislatively
 
00:26:00.590 --> 00:26:00.600 align:start position:0%
budget wise it's going to take us a
 
00:26:02.269 --> 00:26:02.279 align:start position:0%
little bit to do that but that's what
 
00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:04.320 align:start position:0%
we're putting and focusing the money and
 
00:26:05.810 --> 00:26:05.820 align:start position:0%
the attention to be able to not only
 
00:26:07.730 --> 00:26:07.740 align:start position:0%
take care of the front end but the back
 
00:26:10.490 --> 00:26:10.500 align:start position:0%
end there's also the inpatient Supply
 
00:26:13.610 --> 00:26:13.620 align:start position:0%
and coordination issues so as we know
 
00:26:17.149 --> 00:26:17.159 align:start position:0%
today there are we have a level of
 
00:26:19.490 --> 00:26:19.500 align:start position:0%
systems of care so we in the children's
 
00:26:21.890 --> 00:26:21.900 align:start position:0%
system of care we have five levels one
 
00:26:23.210 --> 00:26:23.220 align:start position:0%
through five and then we have the
 
00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:24.470 align:start position:0%
through five and then we have the
hospital

00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:24.480 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
00:26:27.710 --> 00:26:27.720 align:start position:0%
starting next Friday on May 26th we will
 
00:26:29.990 --> 00:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
have our first level five service called
 
00:26:31.610 --> 00:26:31.620 align:start position:0%
the psychiatric Residential Treatment
 
00:26:33.730 --> 00:26:33.740 align:start position:0%
Facility that's the
 
00:26:36.289 --> 00:26:36.299 align:start position:0%
p-r-tf psychiatric Residential Treatment
 
00:26:38.690 --> 00:26:38.700 align:start position:0%
Facility first in New Hampshire it's
 
00:26:40.130 --> 00:26:40.140 align:start position:0%
pretty groundbreaking it's pretty
 
00:26:42.110 --> 00:26:42.120 align:start position:0%
exciting I believe all of you will be
 
00:26:45.529 --> 00:26:45.539 align:start position:0%
invited to that for it for next week for
 
00:26:49.130 --> 00:26:49.140 align:start position:0%
next Friday at Hampstead Hospital I've
 
00:26:50.630 --> 00:26:50.640 align:start position:0%
seen it you've seen it you may have
 
00:26:53.570 --> 00:26:53.580 align:start position:0%
heard it you've heard of it so that's
 
00:26:54.710 --> 00:26:54.720 align:start position:0%
very exciting for us that's going to be
 
00:26:56.870 --> 00:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
serving children serving ages 5 to 21
 
00:26:59.029 --> 00:26:59.039 align:start position:0%
and those will be the kids that maybe
 
00:27:01.730 --> 00:27:01.740 align:start position:0%
don't need that acute level of care and
 
00:27:03.529 --> 00:27:03.539 align:start position:0%
really you know maybe struggling to stay
 
00:27:06.230 --> 00:27:06.240 align:start position:0%
in a successfully finish treatment in a
 
00:27:08.029 --> 00:27:08.039 align:start position:0%
lower level of care so just because
 
00:27:09.529 --> 00:27:09.539 align:start position:0%
you're in five doesn't mean you go four
 
00:27:11.269 --> 00:27:11.279 align:start position:0%
three two one you could be five and step
 
00:27:12.769 --> 00:27:12.779 align:start position:0%
home you could be five and maybe you
 
00:27:15.110 --> 00:27:15.120 align:start position:0%
step down to four and then go home and
 
00:27:17.330 --> 00:27:17.340 align:start position:0%
the event that you're five and you need
 
00:27:19.010 --> 00:27:19.020 align:start position:0%
additional you can be assessed and
 
00:27:20.510 --> 00:27:20.520 align:start position:0%
potentially receive those Services right
 
00:27:22.010 --> 00:27:22.020 align:start position:0%
at New Hampshire hospital for the acute
 
00:27:25.490 --> 00:27:25.500 align:start position:0%
level of care we are also I've got a
 
00:27:27.169 --> 00:27:27.179 align:start position:0%
grant from samsa for a certified
 
00:27:28.850 --> 00:27:28.860 align:start position:0%
community behavioral health clinics
 
00:27:31.250 --> 00:27:31.260 align:start position:0%
there'll be two pilots this year if
 
00:27:33.230 --> 00:27:33.240 align:start position:0%
those go well those will be stood up
 
00:27:34.909 --> 00:27:34.919 align:start position:0%
throughout the state so that's basically
 
00:27:36.590 --> 00:27:36.600 align:start position:0%
serving populations that have
 
00:27:38.269 --> 00:27:38.279 align:start position:0%
co-occurring issues of substance use
 
00:27:41.029 --> 00:27:41.039 align:start position:0%
disorder as well as mental health issues
 
00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:43.440 align:start position:0%
in addition to that we have what we call
 
00:27:45.169 --> 00:27:45.179 align:start position:0%
care coordination so we're targeting
 
00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
care coordination positions to assist
 
00:27:50.390 --> 00:27:50.400 align:start position:0%
with bed management so I will share with
 
00:27:52.789 --> 00:27:52.799 align:start position:0%
you that today as of today we have 30
 
00:27:54.769 --> 00:27:54.779 align:start position:0%
people on our wait list
 
00:27:58.549 --> 00:27:58.559 align:start position:0%
today we have 25 drf open beds in the
 
00:28:00.110 --> 00:28:00.120 align:start position:0%
system that are not New Hampshire
 
00:28:02.570 --> 00:28:02.580 align:start position:0%
hospital beds so I'll just say that we
 
00:28:04.789 --> 00:28:04.799 align:start position:0%
have 25 open beds that are not New
 
00:28:06.890 --> 00:28:06.900 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital so this is a real
 
00:28:08.810 --> 00:28:08.820 align:start position:0%
problem those beds are in hospitals
 
00:28:10.970 --> 00:28:10.980 align:start position:0%
right now and if you look at our website
 
00:28:13.250 --> 00:28:13.260 align:start position:0%
you will be able to see who those
 
00:28:15.409 --> 00:28:15.419 align:start position:0%
facilities are that have open beds we
 
00:28:17.930 --> 00:28:17.940 align:start position:0%
have 25 people 25 beds 30 people we
 
00:28:20.510 --> 00:28:20.520 align:start position:0%
could have a wait list of five today so
 
00:28:22.190 --> 00:28:22.200 align:start position:0%
when we talk about Mission zero it's
 
00:28:23.870 --> 00:28:23.880 align:start position:0%
really important I just want to make the
 
00:28:26.510 --> 00:28:26.520 align:start position:0%
point that it takes all of the system to
 
00:28:27.710 --> 00:28:27.720 align:start position:0%
to be able to address that
 
00:28:32.750 --> 00:28:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:35.640 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry you are speaking so fast
 
00:28:37.970 --> 00:28:37.980 align:start position:0%
and I'm just hoping that maybe you have
 
00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:40.320 align:start position:0%
this written down or notes that you
 
00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:42.480 align:start position:0%
could send to us or a handout or
 
00:28:43.970 --> 00:28:43.980 align:start position:0%
something sure just because I can't
 
00:28:46.070 --> 00:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
write this fast and it's all really in
 
00:28:48.110 --> 00:28:48.120 align:start position:0%
for interesting information that I
 
00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:51.240 align:start position:0%
suspect our clerk is probably feeling so
 
00:28:52.909 --> 00:28:52.919 align:start position:0%
the good news is that it's we did a
 
00:28:54.590 --> 00:28:54.600 align:start position:0%
press release it's on our website but
 
00:28:56.149 --> 00:28:56.159 align:start position:0%
much of what I'm sharing with you right
 
00:28:57.890 --> 00:28:57.900 align:start position:0%
now today so we can get you that written
 
00:29:00.289 --> 00:29:00.299 align:start position:0%
statement and I will link that try to
 
00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
speak slower I don't mind your speaking
 
00:29:04.669 --> 00:29:04.679 align:start position:0%
fast I just can't write that fast sure
 
00:29:06.409 --> 00:29:06.419 align:start position:0%
understand if the information is
 
00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:08.760 align:start position:0%
elsewhere my ears are fine if my end
 
00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't keep up sure so I so I just the
 
00:29:13.730 --> 00:29:13.740 align:start position:0%
point I want to make when we think about
 
00:29:15.890 --> 00:29:15.900 align:start position:0%
care coordinator positions it's really
 
00:29:17.930 --> 00:29:17.940 align:start position:0%
somebody at that macro level being able
 
00:29:19.789 --> 00:29:19.799 align:start position:0%
to look at what are all the resources in
 
00:29:22.070 --> 00:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
the system State and not State and how
 
00:29:23.810 --> 00:29:23.820 align:start position:0%
are they being utilized so our care
 
00:29:25.669 --> 00:29:25.679 align:start position:0%
coordination positions if we're able to
 
00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:28.320 align:start position:0%
get this approved would be having
 
00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:30.480 align:start position:0%
um social workers in RNs being able to
 
00:29:32.389 --> 00:29:32.399 align:start position:0%
do that oversight and then working in
 
00:29:34.310 --> 00:29:34.320 align:start position:0%
calling hospitals and saying we have
 
00:29:35.810 --> 00:29:35.820 align:start position:0%
patients can we get patients in and
 
00:29:37.310 --> 00:29:37.320 align:start position:0%
moving patients around so that those
 
00:29:38.690 --> 00:29:38.700 align:start position:0%
beds are being used and people aren't
 
00:29:40.250 --> 00:29:40.260 align:start position:0%
staying in the system longer than they
 
00:29:43.190 --> 00:29:43.200 align:start position:0%
need to representative Edwards I'm I'm
 
00:29:46.190 --> 00:29:46.200 align:start position:0%
afraid you we may fast forward through
 
00:29:48.350 --> 00:29:48.360 align:start position:0%
uh an important thing you just said I
 
00:29:51.049 --> 00:29:51.059 align:start position:0%
that needs some detail you you said we
 
00:29:54.830 --> 00:29:54.840 align:start position:0%
have 25 drf beds that are open we have
 
00:29:57.590 --> 00:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
30 patients competing for those 25 beds
 
00:30:00.289 --> 00:30:00.299 align:start position:0%
but there sounds to be seems to be a
 
00:30:02.810 --> 00:30:02.820 align:start position:0%
problem in getting those any of those 30
 
00:30:02.820 --> 00:30:04.310 align:start position:0%
problem in getting those any of those 30
placed

00:30:04.310 --> 00:30:04.320 align:start position:0%
placed
 
00:30:06.590 --> 00:30:06.600 align:start position:0%
did I hear that wrong or is there a
 
00:30:09.950 --> 00:30:09.960 align:start position:0%
reason why we can't take those 30 and
 
00:30:13.010 --> 00:30:13.020 align:start position:0%
move some of them it currently has no
 
00:30:14.990 --> 00:30:15.000 align:start position:0%
authority to force any of those
 
00:30:17.570 --> 00:30:17.580 align:start position:0%
hospitals to take patients off of the Ed
 
00:30:20.750 --> 00:30:20.760 align:start position:0%
so so short of force what is the issue
 
00:30:23.269 --> 00:30:23.279 align:start position:0%
what's the problem why why they want to
 
00:30:25.070 --> 00:30:25.080 align:start position:0%
accept patients we have patients it
 
00:30:27.830 --> 00:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
sounds like it's win-win
 
00:30:32.810 --> 00:30:32.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:34.730 --> 00:30:34.740 align:start position:0%
I'm not quite sure exactly what the
 
00:30:36.169 --> 00:30:36.179 align:start position:0%
roadblock is but it's not a new
 
00:30:38.210 --> 00:30:38.220 align:start position:0%
roadblock and I think from our
 
00:30:40.130 --> 00:30:40.140 align:start position:0%
perspective we're looking at it or do we
 
00:30:41.870 --> 00:30:41.880 align:start position:0%
not have good care coordination I mean
 
00:30:44.330 --> 00:30:44.340 align:start position:0%
those the hospitals report to us what
 
00:30:46.370 --> 00:30:46.380 align:start position:0%
open beds they have it goes on our
 
00:30:49.490 --> 00:30:49.500 align:start position:0%
website we ask them to to take them why
 
00:30:51.230 --> 00:30:51.240 align:start position:0%
the reasons they can't take them I can't
 
00:30:52.669 --> 00:30:52.679 align:start position:0%
answer that
 
00:30:54.889 --> 00:30:54.899 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I don't see Paul I'm in a
 
00:30:57.590 --> 00:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
hand either here today

can you answer that
 
00:31:04.909 --> 00:31:04.919 align:start position:0%
could you speak to that on behalf of
 
00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
hospitals there's there's a mic at the
 
00:31:08.630 --> 00:31:08.640 align:start position:0%
end of the table if you just want to use
 
00:31:20.750 --> 00:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:23.090 --> 00:31:23.100 align:start position:0%

00:31:56.870 --> 00:31:56.880 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you and you are with the
 
00:31:59.149 --> 00:31:59.159 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Hospital Association as
 
00:32:01.010 --> 00:32:01.020 align:start position:0%
what again I'm the Executive Vice
 
00:32:03.409 --> 00:32:03.419 align:start position:0%
President exec VP okay yeah
 
00:32:05.269 --> 00:32:05.279 align:start position:0%
so thank you for the question
 
00:32:07.430 --> 00:32:07.440 align:start position:0%
um yes there are
 
00:32:10.010 --> 00:32:10.020 align:start position:0%
hospitals that do have designated
 
00:32:12.289 --> 00:32:12.299 align:start position:0%
receiving facilities throughout the
 
00:32:12.299 --> 00:32:13.730 align:start position:0%
receiving facilities throughout the
state

00:32:13.730 --> 00:32:13.740 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:32:16.250 --> 00:32:16.260 align:start position:0%
um they may have some beds that are
 
00:32:19.250 --> 00:32:19.260 align:start position:0%
unfilled because they also have staffing
 
00:32:21.049 --> 00:32:21.059 align:start position:0%
issues just like New Hampshire hospital
 
00:32:22.810 --> 00:32:22.820 align:start position:0%
does as well
 
00:32:25.310 --> 00:32:25.320 align:start position:0%
I need to look at the Department's
 
00:32:26.930 --> 00:32:26.940 align:start position:0%
website to understand their definition
 
00:32:29.870 --> 00:32:29.880 align:start position:0%
of open beds because there is an ability
 
00:32:32.470 --> 00:32:32.480 align:start position:0%
for the hospitals to
 
00:32:41.830 --> 00:32:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:43.970 --> 00:32:43.980 align:start position:0%
the hospital has the ability the
 
00:32:46.310 --> 00:32:46.320 align:start position:0%
hospital also fills some of those drf
 
00:32:47.870 --> 00:32:47.880 align:start position:0%
beds with voluntary patients which I
 
00:32:49.549 --> 00:32:49.559 align:start position:0%
think sometimes fills the beds as well
 
00:32:52.250 --> 00:32:52.260 align:start position:0%
not with drf patients
 
00:32:55.310 --> 00:32:55.320 align:start position:0%
um that is potentially possible but
 
00:32:57.289 --> 00:32:57.299 align:start position:0%
um that would mean that that bed is not
 
00:32:57.299 --> 00:32:58.669 align:start position:0%
um that would mean that that bed is not
full

00:32:58.669 --> 00:32:58.679 align:start position:0%
full
 
00:33:00.830 --> 00:33:00.840 align:start position:0%
so I guess we need to understand from
 
00:33:02.269 --> 00:33:02.279 align:start position:0%
the Department's perspective what they
 
00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
consider to be open beds versus
 
00:33:06.649 --> 00:33:06.659 align:start position:0%
available beds so I would love to have
 
00:33:08.330 --> 00:33:08.340 align:start position:0%
that conversation with the department so
 
00:33:10.850 --> 00:33:10.860 align:start position:0%
we can clear up that distinction okay
 
00:33:12.710 --> 00:33:12.720 align:start position:0%
that's what we do here is we try to make
 
00:33:15.409 --> 00:33:15.419 align:start position:0%
everybody get absolutely okay good we'll
 
00:33:17.269 --> 00:33:17.279 align:start position:0%
do that thank you so much thank you Mr
 
00:33:17.279 --> 00:33:18.230 align:start position:0%
do that thank you so much thank you Mr
chair

00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:18.240 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:33:20.750 --> 00:33:20.760 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant
 
00:33:22.730 --> 00:33:22.740 align:start position:0%
out of curiosity
 
00:33:24.649 --> 00:33:24.659 align:start position:0%
um in regards to the hospitals with
 
00:33:28.430 --> 00:33:28.440 align:start position:0%
these open beds or available beds
 
00:33:31.009 --> 00:33:31.019 align:start position:0%
is there certain hospitals it seems to
 
00:33:33.710 --> 00:33:33.720 align:start position:0%
be more prevalent time at the time or is
 
00:33:36.169 --> 00:33:36.179 align:start position:0%
it sort of a random
 
00:33:37.669 --> 00:33:37.679 align:start position:0%
so I'm trying to get to are there
 
00:33:40.610 --> 00:33:40.620 align:start position:0%
certain hospitals that are showing up on
 
00:33:43.190 --> 00:33:43.200 align:start position:0%
that calendar so to speak
 
00:33:45.169 --> 00:33:45.179 align:start position:0%
time and time again or is it basically
 
00:33:47.330 --> 00:33:47.340 align:start position:0%
at that point in time sort of a random
 
00:33:49.130 --> 00:33:49.140 align:start position:0%
selection between the hospitals within
 
00:33:51.289 --> 00:33:51.299 align:start position:0%
the state sure I'd have to go back and
 
00:33:52.970 --> 00:33:52.980 align:start position:0%
analyze that data look to see if they're
 
00:33:54.409 --> 00:33:54.419 align:start position:0%
ones that were trending a certain way
 
00:33:57.289 --> 00:33:57.299 align:start position:0%
but not every hospital in the state has
 
00:33:59.750 --> 00:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
drf beds we do have certain hospitals
 
00:34:01.730 --> 00:34:01.740 align:start position:0%
that have beds certain number of beds
 
00:34:04.570 --> 00:34:04.580 align:start position:0%
and they are supposed to be taking
 
00:34:06.649 --> 00:34:06.659 align:start position:0%
involuntary patients just like New
 
00:34:09.290 --> 00:34:09.300 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital the the data would be
 
00:34:11.690 --> 00:34:11.700 align:start position:0%
helpful thank you yes thank you
 
00:34:11.700 --> 00:34:13.149 align:start position:0%
helpful thank you yes thank you
so

00:34:13.149 --> 00:34:13.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:34:15.889 --> 00:34:15.899 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards okay thank you so
 
00:34:19.669 --> 00:34:19.679 align:start position:0%
Madam commissioner I I uh I I hope that
 
00:34:21.889 --> 00:34:21.899 align:start position:0%
you have a very productive conversation
 
00:34:25.369 --> 00:34:25.379 align:start position:0%
and uh with the hospital Association and
 
00:34:27.470 --> 00:34:27.480 align:start position:0%
if you if you guys in the process of
 
00:34:30.770 --> 00:34:30.780 align:start position:0%
talking this through end up needing some
 
00:34:34.490 --> 00:34:34.500 align:start position:0%
some help you know uh please you know
 
00:34:36.169 --> 00:34:36.179 align:start position:0%
let us know you know you could let me
 
00:34:38.930 --> 00:34:38.940 align:start position:0%
know you could let the chair know but um
 
00:34:41.629 --> 00:34:41.639 align:start position:0%
I think we need an all hands on deck
 
00:34:44.329 --> 00:34:44.339 align:start position:0%
approach and I think you do too on
 
00:34:47.089 --> 00:34:47.099 align:start position:0%
getting this ER boarding issue under
 
00:34:50.570 --> 00:34:50.580 align:start position:0%
control and and so we we can't we can't
 
00:34:52.129 --> 00:34:52.139 align:start position:0%
help you if we don't know what the
 
00:34:54.589 --> 00:34:54.599 align:start position:0%
problems are and so we're very open to
 
00:34:56.510 --> 00:34:56.520 align:start position:0%
that and and I would encourage the
 
00:34:59.270 --> 00:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
hospital Association to to be part of
 
00:35:01.970 --> 00:35:01.980 align:start position:0%
the team you know in Afghanistan we said
 
00:35:04.910 --> 00:35:04.920 align:start position:0%
one team one fight even though we were
 
00:35:07.790 --> 00:35:07.800 align:start position:0%
from all the NATO countries and all the
 
00:35:10.630 --> 00:35:10.640 align:start position:0%
the tribes in Afghanistan we still
 
00:35:14.329 --> 00:35:14.339 align:start position:0%
unified to do one thing and so the one
 
00:35:16.670 --> 00:35:16.680 align:start position:0%
thing we have to unify to do I think is
 
00:35:18.710 --> 00:35:18.720 align:start position:0%
to get this ER boarding thing down to
 
00:35:22.069 --> 00:35:22.079 align:start position:0%
zero so I I just I just would like us to
 
00:35:23.569 --> 00:35:23.579 align:start position:0%
have that Focus
 
00:35:27.650 --> 00:35:27.660 align:start position:0%
thank you I I will completely support
 
00:35:30.349 --> 00:35:30.359 align:start position:0%
that it is an all hands on deck effort
 
00:35:32.569 --> 00:35:32.579 align:start position:0%
it cannot just be the state
 
00:35:34.970 --> 00:35:34.980 align:start position:0%
uh the state can't one can't move nimbly
 
00:35:36.470 --> 00:35:36.480 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't have the resources we
 
00:35:38.210 --> 00:35:38.220 align:start position:0%
have to work with all of our partners so
 
00:35:40.130 --> 00:35:40.140 align:start position:0%
when we look at these positions that I'm
 
00:35:41.329 --> 00:35:41.339 align:start position:0%
talking about the care coordinator
 
00:35:43.250 --> 00:35:43.260 align:start position:0%
positions they would be doing just that
 
00:35:44.750 --> 00:35:44.760 align:start position:0%
they would be calling and working with
 
00:35:46.790 --> 00:35:46.800 align:start position:0%
the hospitals and figuring out where are
 
00:35:48.230 --> 00:35:48.240 align:start position:0%
the barriers where are the pinch points
 
00:35:50.030 --> 00:35:50.040 align:start position:0%
why why aren't these beds getting filled
 
00:35:52.069 --> 00:35:52.079 align:start position:0%
so it's Our intention to be able to put
 
00:35:53.750 --> 00:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
that into place to have better care
 
00:35:55.790 --> 00:35:55.800 align:start position:0%
coordination Court care coordination and
 
00:35:57.410 --> 00:35:57.420 align:start position:0%
to be able to have some movement in the
 
00:35:59.390 --> 00:35:59.400 align:start position:0%
system and not have people waiting in
 
00:36:01.069 --> 00:36:01.079 align:start position:0%
EDS I think we all want the same thing
 
00:36:03.170 --> 00:36:03.180 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day so I just share
 
00:36:04.910 --> 00:36:04.920 align:start position:0%
that my update in terms of the
 
00:36:06.770 --> 00:36:06.780 align:start position:0%
department puts forth its commitment
 
00:36:09.710 --> 00:36:09.720 align:start position:0%
towards Mission zero to do its best to
 
00:36:12.890 --> 00:36:12.900 align:start position:0%
reduce uh Ed boarding but we cannot do
 
00:36:15.310 --> 00:36:15.320 align:start position:0%
it alone um I will just reiterate that
 
00:36:18.109 --> 00:36:18.119 align:start position:0%
so when we get to you know things like
 
00:36:19.970 --> 00:36:19.980 align:start position:0%
landlord incentive programs we are going
 
00:36:21.710 --> 00:36:21.720 align:start position:0%
to need some help legislatively for sure
 
00:36:24.230 --> 00:36:24.240 align:start position:0%
our transitional housing beds um you
 
00:36:26.930 --> 00:36:26.940 align:start position:0%
know we see contracts going through if I
 
00:36:28.609 --> 00:36:28.619 align:start position:0%
could just continue with some of my
 
00:36:30.710 --> 00:36:30.720 align:start position:0%
update in segwaying into New Hampshire
 
00:36:32.450 --> 00:36:32.460 align:start position:0%
hospital I talked about the renovation
 
00:36:35.870 --> 00:36:35.880 align:start position:0%
Nation we're also recruiting recruitment
 
00:36:39.589 --> 00:36:39.599 align:start position:0%
efforts continue and will intensify so
 
00:36:41.630 --> 00:36:41.640 align:start position:0%
as we near the date and date of the
 
00:36:43.430 --> 00:36:43.440 align:start position:0%
renovation that we're able to bring beds
 
00:36:45.890 --> 00:36:45.900 align:start position:0%
online as soon as possible but in
 
00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
addition to New Hampshire hospital we
 
00:36:49.430 --> 00:36:49.440 align:start position:0%
also have a forensic hospital that is
 
00:36:52.430 --> 00:36:52.440 align:start position:0%
going to be built on top of or beside I
 
00:36:55.190 --> 00:36:55.200 align:start position:0%
should say New Hampshire hospital so
 
00:36:58.010 --> 00:36:58.020 align:start position:0%
that contract just received approval
 
00:36:59.569 --> 00:36:59.579 align:start position:0%
this morning at fiscal for a little bit
 
00:37:01.670 --> 00:37:01.680 align:start position:0%
of extra money because all costs have
 
00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:02.640 align:start position:0%
gone up
 
00:37:05.569 --> 00:37:05.579 align:start position:0%
since we started our bid process but Das
 
00:37:07.130 --> 00:37:07.140 align:start position:0%
assures me that the cost difference
 
00:37:08.690 --> 00:37:08.700 align:start position:0%
that's that it has gone up is still
 
00:37:10.609 --> 00:37:10.619 align:start position:0%
within a contingency that's somewhat
 
00:37:12.290 --> 00:37:12.300 align:start position:0%
reasonable compared to other projects so
 
00:37:14.390 --> 00:37:14.400 align:start position:0%
I remain hopeful that we will now still
 
00:37:16.370 --> 00:37:16.380 align:start position:0%
have enough money to break ground we
 
00:37:18.230 --> 00:37:18.240 align:start position:0%
have a contractor for construction
 
00:37:21.410 --> 00:37:21.420 align:start position:0%
selected and that work is about to begin
 
00:37:23.510 --> 00:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
so that's pretty exciting um it's been a
 
00:37:26.810 --> 00:37:26.820 align:start position:0%
long road to get there and two one other
 
00:37:29.450 --> 00:37:29.460 align:start position:0%
thing is just construction I I know I
 
00:37:32.089 --> 00:37:32.099 align:start position:0%
think I should get a hard hat for my job
 
00:37:35.030 --> 00:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
here the site selection for the new
 
00:37:38.510 --> 00:37:38.520 align:start position:0%
Youth Development Center the evaluation
 
00:37:41.030 --> 00:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
site report was released last month and
 
00:37:43.069 --> 00:37:43.079 align:start position:0%
some of you may be familiar with that we
 
00:37:44.569 --> 00:37:44.579 align:start position:0%
compared three sites we had an outside
 
00:37:47.390 --> 00:37:47.400 align:start position:0%
party do the three sites so we looked at
 
00:37:50.150 --> 00:37:50.160 align:start position:0%
things like the size of the site the
 
00:37:52.670 --> 00:37:52.680 align:start position:0%
ability for shared services access
 
00:37:55.010 --> 00:37:55.020 align:start position:0%
utilities surrounding environment
 
00:37:57.890 --> 00:37:57.900 align:start position:0%
proximity to population centers and
 
00:37:59.750 --> 00:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
external services so out of the three
 
00:38:01.210 --> 00:38:01.220 align:start position:0%
that we looked at
 
00:38:04.069 --> 00:38:04.079 align:start position:0%
Hampstead was the clear winner in terms
 
00:38:07.069 --> 00:38:07.079 align:start position:0%
of points that it came in the quality of
 
00:38:09.050 --> 00:38:09.060 align:start position:0%
the neighbors really nailed it we didn't
 
00:38:10.910 --> 00:38:10.920 align:start position:0%
hear that yeah that was that was an
 
00:38:13.930 --> 00:38:13.940 align:start position:0%
unofficial assessment
 
00:38:17.930 --> 00:38:17.940 align:start position:0%
so uh we we are um we are currently
 
00:38:20.810 --> 00:38:20.820 align:start position:0%
waiting for the uh legislatively there's
 
00:38:22.910 --> 00:38:22.920 align:start position:0%
an impact commission that committee that
 
00:38:24.589 --> 00:38:24.599 align:start position:0%
is required to start we're waiting for
 
00:38:26.089 --> 00:38:26.099 align:start position:0%
that to start and we will engage with
 
00:38:27.589 --> 00:38:27.599 align:start position:0%
the town and answer all the questions
 
00:38:29.630 --> 00:38:29.640 align:start position:0%
that we need to let me comment I was
 
00:38:32.150 --> 00:38:32.160 align:start position:0%
privileged to be at that meeting and uh
 
00:38:35.589 --> 00:38:35.599 align:start position:0%
with the the professionals hired to
 
00:38:38.030 --> 00:38:38.040 align:start position:0%
examine the sites you know people from
 
00:38:39.470 --> 00:38:39.480 align:start position:0%
outside the state this is what they do
 
00:38:41.870 --> 00:38:41.880 align:start position:0%
for for a living and so on and I was
 
00:38:44.450 --> 00:38:44.460 align:start position:0%
very impressed with how thorough they
 
00:38:47.150 --> 00:38:47.160 align:start position:0%
went through evaluating they didn't just
 
00:38:49.849 --> 00:38:49.859 align:start position:0%
grab something for God knows what
 
00:38:51.589 --> 00:38:51.599 align:start position:0%
reasons they they really did their job
 
00:38:51.599 --> 00:38:52.430 align:start position:0%
reasons they they really did their job
well

00:38:52.430 --> 00:38:52.440 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:38:54.349 --> 00:38:54.359 align:start position:0%
um the only thing we lack is a subway
 
00:38:56.450 --> 00:38:56.460 align:start position:0%
stop outside the building you know
 
00:38:58.069 --> 00:38:58.079 align:start position:0%
transportation is difficult in South
 
00:39:00.770 --> 00:39:00.780 align:start position:0%
Rockingham County but uh other than that
 
00:39:03.349 --> 00:39:03.359 align:start position:0%
yeah they did a great job if you're
 
00:39:05.030 --> 00:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
interested in seeing the report it is on
 
00:39:07.130 --> 00:39:07.140 align:start position:0%
our website if you would like to look at
 
00:39:09.530 --> 00:39:09.540 align:start position:0%
that so I know I've taken up a lot of
 
00:39:11.990 --> 00:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
time with my my update today however I
 
00:39:13.849 --> 00:39:13.859 align:start position:0%
know you did ask me to bring director
 
00:39:16.069 --> 00:39:16.079 align:start position:0%
Buxton and now he's so much that he's
 
00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:19.200 align:start position:0%
his own item he's not part of my update
 
00:39:21.170 --> 00:39:21.180 align:start position:0%
um so I do want to point out that when
 
00:39:23.150 --> 00:39:23.160 align:start position:0%
director Buxton comes up we also have
 
00:39:25.190 --> 00:39:25.200 align:start position:0%
Stephanie Locke who is our director of
 
00:39:26.930 --> 00:39:26.940 align:start position:0%
emergency preparedness for the
 
00:39:28.250 --> 00:39:28.260 align:start position:0%
department and she works in public
 
00:39:30.470 --> 00:39:30.480 align:start position:0%
health uh as part of the Department of
 
00:39:32.810 --> 00:39:32.820 align:start position:0%
healthy human services and is connected
 
00:39:35.630 --> 00:39:35.640 align:start position:0%
to the work that hsam will be doing
 
00:39:37.010 --> 00:39:37.020 align:start position:0%
so if you don't have any further
 
00:39:38.630 --> 00:39:38.640 align:start position:0%
questions for me do we have any further
 
00:39:41.690 --> 00:39:41.700 align:start position:0%
questions representative McDonald
 
00:39:43.490 --> 00:39:43.500 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
00:39:45.770 --> 00:39:45.780 align:start position:0%
commissioner I just wanted to clarify at
 
00:39:47.630 --> 00:39:47.640 align:start position:0%
the beginning you said Mission zero and
 
00:39:50.030 --> 00:39:50.040 align:start position:0%
the goal was to reduce a certain type of
 
00:39:51.530 --> 00:39:51.540 align:start position:0%
wait list was it the New Hampshire
 
00:39:53.470 --> 00:39:53.480 align:start position:0%
hospital bed wait list the emergency
 
00:39:56.089 --> 00:39:56.099 align:start position:0%
emergency department wait list okay
 
00:39:57.490 --> 00:39:57.500 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:40:00.589 --> 00:40:00.599 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards
 
00:40:02.390 --> 00:40:02.400 align:start position:0%
so I think technically it's not an
 
00:40:04.849 --> 00:40:04.859 align:start position:0%
emergency department wait list it's the
 
00:40:06.349 --> 00:40:06.359 align:start position:0%
boarding issue within the emergency
 
00:40:08.870 --> 00:40:08.880 align:start position:0%
rooms there's all different ways to say
 
00:40:10.250 --> 00:40:10.260 align:start position:0%
it but yeah Sue could say they eat
 
00:40:12.410 --> 00:40:12.420 align:start position:0%
people say the Ed wait list yeah I'm
 
00:40:14.510 --> 00:40:14.520 align:start position:0%
easily confused I just didn't want to
 
00:40:16.310 --> 00:40:16.320 align:start position:0%
misunderstand so I have two questions Mr
 
00:40:18.050 --> 00:40:18.060 align:start position:0%
chair one is a big one one's a little
 
00:40:18.060 --> 00:40:19.250 align:start position:0%
chair one is a big one one's a little
one

00:40:19.250 --> 00:40:19.260 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:40:23.150 --> 00:40:23.160 align:start position:0%
um uh so ultimately who is the one
 
00:40:26.810 --> 00:40:26.820 align:start position:0%
person in charge of mission zero who is
 
00:40:28.550 --> 00:40:28.560 align:start position:0%
your one accountable leader in the
 
00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:30.849 align:start position:0%
your one accountable leader in the
department

00:40:30.849 --> 00:40:30.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:34.490 --> 00:40:34.500 align:start position:0%
uh one accountable leader would be me
 
00:40:36.710 --> 00:40:36.720 align:start position:0%
but you surely must delegate you can't
 
00:40:38.329 --> 00:40:38.339 align:start position:0%
do everything yourself I have a
 
00:40:39.950 --> 00:40:39.960 align:start position:0%
behavioral health team that is on this
 
00:40:43.130 --> 00:40:43.140 align:start position:0%
that can is comprised of um our
 
00:40:44.870 --> 00:40:44.880 align:start position:0%
associate commissioner hand and our
 
00:40:47.870 --> 00:40:47.880 align:start position:0%
Katya Fox and Ellen Lapointe so Katya
 
00:40:49.790 --> 00:40:49.800 align:start position:0%
Fox is the director of our Behavioral
 
00:40:51.770 --> 00:40:51.780 align:start position:0%
Health and Ellen Lapointe is the CEO of
 
00:40:53.810 --> 00:40:53.820 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire hospital that is the core
 
00:40:55.970 --> 00:40:55.980 align:start position:0%
team working on this it's a team but
 
00:40:58.130 --> 00:40:58.140 align:start position:0%
who's in charge
 
00:41:00.650 --> 00:41:00.660 align:start position:0%
I I'm sorry I'm being obsessive because
 
00:41:03.230 --> 00:41:03.240 align:start position:0%
I I I it's not a simple answer for me to
 
00:41:05.329 --> 00:41:05.339 align:start position:0%
say who's in charge it would depend on
 
00:41:06.890 --> 00:41:06.900 align:start position:0%
what the issue or who has decision
 
00:41:08.870 --> 00:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
making Authority on that we all do but
 
00:41:10.609 --> 00:41:10.619 align:start position:0%
uh Marissa hen would be at the helm of
 
00:41:13.130 --> 00:41:13.140 align:start position:0%
that okay and then this is a detailed
 
00:41:15.290 --> 00:41:15.300 align:start position:0%
question you probably don't know you
 
00:41:18.349 --> 00:41:18.359 align:start position:0%
were talking about uh quite a a new
 
00:41:21.050 --> 00:41:21.060 align:start position:0%
23-hour crisis stabilization uh
 
00:41:24.290 --> 00:41:24.300 align:start position:0%
capability and I'm just curious if uh
 
00:41:26.750 --> 00:41:26.760 align:start position:0%
part of coordinating that included
 
00:41:28.670 --> 00:41:28.680 align:start position:0%
making sure that we had a billing
 
00:41:31.010 --> 00:41:31.020 align:start position:0%
approach to fund it is is there are
 
00:41:34.970 --> 00:41:34.980 align:start position:0%
there any issues with having there be a
 
00:41:37.930 --> 00:41:37.940 align:start position:0%
funding source for the uh crisis
 
00:41:40.250 --> 00:41:40.260 align:start position:0%
stabilization the 20th I believe there
 
00:41:41.930 --> 00:41:41.940 align:start position:0%
is a funding source for that I think
 
00:41:43.730 --> 00:41:43.740 align:start position:0%
it's a contracted service
 
00:41:46.430 --> 00:41:46.440 align:start position:0%
with the Department oh okay because it's
 
00:41:49.130 --> 00:41:49.140 align:start position:0%
part of the same it sounded new to me so
 
00:41:50.270 --> 00:41:50.280 align:start position:0%
I didn't know if there was a billing
 
00:41:52.310 --> 00:41:52.320 align:start position:0%
code whether it was a contract or you
 
00:41:54.230 --> 00:41:54.240 align:start position:0%
know no money no Mission so I'm just
 
00:41:55.910 --> 00:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
curious it is a new service that we're
 
00:41:57.829 --> 00:41:57.839 align:start position:0%
rolling out it's been in the making of
 
00:41:59.329 --> 00:41:59.339 align:start position:0%
development for a while
 
00:42:01.250 --> 00:42:01.260 align:start position:0%
um but they are funded
 
00:42:03.490 --> 00:42:03.500 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
see no further questions thank you for
 
00:42:08.150 --> 00:42:08.160 align:start position:0%
your monthly update thank you see you at
 
00:42:12.650 --> 00:42:12.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:15.710 --> 00:42:15.720 align:start position:0%
and now we do call uh forward Mr Robert
 
00:42:20.329 --> 00:42:20.339 align:start position:0%
Buxton and Stephanie Locke and this is a
 
00:42:22.550 --> 00:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
kind of pandemic after action report
 
00:42:25.370 --> 00:42:25.380 align:start position:0%
that representative Edwards encouraged
 
00:42:27.829 --> 00:42:27.839 align:start position:0%
us to hear about uh
 
00:42:31.790 --> 00:42:31.800 align:start position:0%
it's always a good idea I do this in the
 
00:42:35.210 --> 00:42:35.220 align:start position:0%
facility that I'm in charge of after an
 
00:42:36.710 --> 00:42:36.720 align:start position:0%
event whether you made a lot of mistakes
 
00:42:38.630 --> 00:42:38.640 align:start position:0%
so you had a great number of successes
 
00:42:40.849 --> 00:42:40.859 align:start position:0%
or somewhere in the middle review see
 
00:42:41.990 --> 00:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
what you did what would you do
 
00:42:43.790 --> 00:42:43.800 align:start position:0%
differently what would you do the same
 
00:42:45.710 --> 00:42:45.720 align:start position:0%
where do we go from here because there
 
00:42:51.589 --> 00:42:51.599 align:start position:0%

the events processes including successes
 
00:44:17.050 --> 00:44:17.060 align:start position:0%
and areas of improvement and solutions
 
00:44:20.210 --> 00:44:20.220 align:start position:0%
are a requirement of the RFP they will
 
00:44:22.430 --> 00:44:22.440 align:start position:0%
focus on the preparedness and response
 
00:44:28.210 --> 00:44:28.220 align:start position:0%
spanning from January 2020 to June 2021.
 
00:44:30.589 --> 00:44:30.599 align:start position:0%
however there will be a summary of
 
00:44:32.150 --> 00:44:32.160 align:start position:0%
details that are outside of that area as
 
00:44:33.170 --> 00:44:33.180 align:start position:0%
we're aware of the public health
 
00:44:36.170 --> 00:44:36.180 align:start position:0%
emergency just ended on May 11th so
 
00:44:38.870 --> 00:44:38.880 align:start position:0%
it'll be a spillover into additional
 
00:44:43.370 --> 00:44:43.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:45.530 --> 00:44:45.540 align:start position:0%
they have proposed and we've accepted a
 
00:44:48.290 --> 00:44:48.300 align:start position:0%
four-phase approach to this review on
 
00:44:50.390 --> 00:44:50.400 align:start position:0%
phase one is the initiation and the
 
00:44:54.069 --> 00:44:54.079 align:start position:0%
project will go from May 2023 to June
 
00:44:57.589 --> 00:44:57.599 align:start position:0%
2024. uh the second phase of this will
 
00:44:59.569 --> 00:44:59.579 align:start position:0%
be data collection and this will be
 
00:45:01.430 --> 00:45:01.440 align:start position:0%
interview surveys and documentation
 
00:45:04.190 --> 00:45:04.200 align:start position:0%
review uh During the period that we
 
00:45:06.230 --> 00:45:06.240 align:start position:0%
discussed and that will take place from
 
00:45:11.690 --> 00:45:11.700 align:start position:0%
May of 2023 to October 2023. the third
 
00:45:14.870 --> 00:45:14.880 align:start position:0%
phase of the project will be the AAR and
 
00:45:16.550 --> 00:45:16.560 align:start position:0%
Improvement Planning Development so this
 
00:45:17.990 --> 00:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
will be the spot where they review the
 
00:45:21.170 --> 00:45:21.180 align:start position:0%
data identify Gap analysis and identify
 
00:45:23.510 --> 00:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
process Improvement and that will take
 
00:45:26.270 --> 00:45:26.280 align:start position:0%
place from September of 2023 to June
 
00:45:29.990 --> 00:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
2024 with additional interviews and data
 
00:45:31.430 --> 00:45:31.440 align:start position:0%
collection and clarifications taking
 
00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:32.390 align:start position:0%
collection and clarifications taking
place

00:45:32.390 --> 00:45:32.400 align:start position:0%
place
 
00:45:34.849 --> 00:45:34.859 align:start position:0%
the fourth phase of the project will be
 
00:45:37.250 --> 00:45:37.260 align:start position:0%
presentation in the final after action
 
00:45:38.930 --> 00:45:38.940 align:start position:0%
review and Improvement plan to the state
 
00:45:41.210 --> 00:45:41.220 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire and that is due in June
 
00:45:43.609 --> 00:45:43.619 align:start position:0%
of 2024.
 
00:45:43.619 --> 00:45:46.010 align:start position:0%
of 2024.
um

00:45:46.010 --> 00:45:46.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:46.020 --> 00:45:47.630 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:45:47.630 --> 00:45:47.640 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:45:50.450 --> 00:45:50.460 align:start position:0%
the work is obviously that of a project
 
00:45:53.210 --> 00:45:53.220 align:start position:0%
team and we have approached the team uh
 
00:45:55.430 --> 00:45:55.440 align:start position:0%
an inclusive of Homeland Security
 
00:45:57.589 --> 00:45:57.599 align:start position:0%
emergency management the Department of
 
00:46:00.050 --> 00:46:00.060 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services the executive
 
00:46:03.290 --> 00:46:03.300 align:start position:0%
branch and the National Guard who is
 
00:46:05.109 --> 00:46:05.119 align:start position:0%
part of the process
 
00:46:08.390 --> 00:46:08.400 align:start position:0%
for implementing and coordinating the
 
00:46:11.450 --> 00:46:11.460 align:start position:0%
response to covet 19. the project team
 
00:46:13.490 --> 00:46:13.500 align:start position:0%
will meet weekly virtually with Title
 
00:46:16.069 --> 00:46:16.079 align:start position:0%
Basin and they will continue to work and
 
00:46:18.589 --> 00:46:18.599 align:start position:0%
conduct their process throughout the
 
00:46:21.410 --> 00:46:21.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:23.870 --> 00:46:23.880 align:start position:0%
focuses of preparedness focus is a
 
00:46:25.430 --> 00:46:25.440 align:start position:0%
barrier that they will they will dial in
 
00:46:27.410 --> 00:46:27.420 align:start position:0%
on they'll review event planning
 
00:46:30.170 --> 00:46:30.180 align:start position:0%
processes review plans created prior to
 
00:46:31.849 --> 00:46:31.859 align:start position:0%
the pandemic and how they were utilized
 
00:46:34.309 --> 00:46:34.319 align:start position:0%
or not utilized response structures and
 
00:46:35.750 --> 00:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
how it impacted the overall event
 
00:46:38.510 --> 00:46:38.520 align:start position:0%
efficiencies and how the can how to
 
00:46:40.790 --> 00:46:40.800 align:start position:0%
continually continuity of operations
 
00:46:43.309 --> 00:46:43.319 align:start position:0%
approach to the continually support the
 
00:46:45.230 --> 00:46:45.240 align:start position:0%
response and preparedness portions of
 
00:46:47.990 --> 00:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:51.530 --> 00:46:51.540 align:start position:0%
response Focus areas will work in those
 
00:46:53.349 --> 00:46:53.359 align:start position:0%
areas that are highlighted in the slide
 
00:46:55.550 --> 00:46:55.560 align:start position:0%
with concentration looking at the
 
00:46:57.109 --> 00:46:57.119 align:start position:0%
unified command post and the unified
 
00:46:58.630 --> 00:46:58.640 align:start position:0%
command approach to the incident
 
00:47:02.210 --> 00:47:02.220 align:start position:0%
communication with both local state and
 
00:47:04.370 --> 00:47:04.380 align:start position:0%
private part sector partners
 
00:47:06.530 --> 00:47:06.540 align:start position:0%
uh the establishment of the supply chain
 
00:47:08.390 --> 00:47:08.400 align:start position:0%
that was so critical to the overall
 
00:47:12.530 --> 00:47:12.540 align:start position:0%
response community and the community to
 
00:47:14.329 --> 00:47:14.339 align:start position:0%
support Public Health efforts with the
 
00:47:16.069 --> 00:47:16.079 align:start position:0%
hospitals nursing homes schools and
 
00:47:20.750 --> 00:47:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:23.329 --> 00:47:23.339 align:start position:0%
areas of note will be specifics to
 
00:47:25.130 --> 00:47:25.140 align:start position:0%
looking at the logistical portion of the
 
00:47:28.370 --> 00:47:28.380 align:start position:0%
distribution of uh excuse me this could
 
00:47:30.170 --> 00:47:30.180 align:start position:0%
be a brain cramp at the end of a busy
 
00:47:31.730 --> 00:47:31.740 align:start position:0%
week I'm trying to see how your talk
 
00:47:33.710 --> 00:47:33.720 align:start position:0%
coordinates with the order of the slides
 
00:47:35.809 --> 00:47:35.819 align:start position:0%
I'm on the area of notes if you look at
 
00:47:37.609 --> 00:47:37.619 align:start position:0%
the top of the slide and I have bullets
 
00:47:40.370 --> 00:47:40.380 align:start position:0%
I I didn't necessarily feel the need to
 
00:47:43.309 --> 00:47:43.319 align:start position:0%
read each slide to you no but it but I
 
00:47:45.650 --> 00:47:45.660 align:start position:0%
do and it means I'm skipping all over
 
00:47:47.870 --> 00:47:47.880 align:start position:0%
the place I'm not paying attention so if
 
00:47:50.450 --> 00:47:50.460 align:start position:0%
you look at area notes area notes area
 
00:47:53.809 --> 00:47:53.819 align:start position:0%
of notes on slide seven slide seven
 
00:47:57.170 --> 00:47:57.180 align:start position:0%
unnumbered okay yeah
 
00:47:58.670 --> 00:47:58.680 align:start position:0%
so we're looking at the logistical
 
00:48:01.130 --> 00:48:01.140 align:start position:0%
plants surrounding protective clothing
 
00:48:03.170 --> 00:48:03.180 align:start position:0%
where the supplies where to find
 
00:48:05.589 --> 00:48:05.599 align:start position:0%
supplies vaccination distribution
 
00:48:08.510 --> 00:48:08.520 align:start position:0%
activation and Staffing the logistical
 
00:48:10.849 --> 00:48:10.859 align:start position:0%
problems and moving supplies around the
 
00:48:13.490 --> 00:48:13.500 align:start position:0%
state uh and pointing out the efforts
 
00:48:15.829 --> 00:48:15.839 align:start position:0%
regarding Staffing Emergency Operations
 
00:48:19.069 --> 00:48:19.079 align:start position:0%
Center on a 24-hour basis how the two on
 
00:48:22.329 --> 00:48:22.339 align:start position:0%
one system worked working with suppliers
 
00:48:24.710 --> 00:48:24.720 align:start position:0%
unemployment and other staff and
 
00:48:27.410 --> 00:48:27.420 align:start position:0%
volunteer volunteers to mobilize and
 
00:48:29.870 --> 00:48:29.880 align:start position:0%
address the response
 
00:48:31.550 --> 00:48:31.560 align:start position:0%
if you look at the goals of the program
 
00:48:34.670 --> 00:48:34.680 align:start position:0%
next slide page eight
 
00:48:36.349 --> 00:48:36.359 align:start position:0%
these are things that we highlighted in
 
00:48:38.510 --> 00:48:38.520 align:start position:0%
the initial kickoff meeting make sure
 
00:48:40.670 --> 00:48:40.680 align:start position:0%
the plan is simple or the report is
 
00:48:42.950 --> 00:48:42.960 align:start position:0%
simple and easy to understand make sure
 
00:48:45.170 --> 00:48:45.180 align:start position:0%
it serves as a guide for plans of
 
00:48:47.809 --> 00:48:47.819 align:start position:0%
disasters moving forward and base the
 
00:48:51.230 --> 00:48:51.240 align:start position:0%
plan and in which response is better
 
00:48:54.349 --> 00:48:54.359 align:start position:0%
for next Crisis structural processes and
 
00:48:56.690 --> 00:48:56.700 align:start position:0%
the state's response can be employed
 
00:49:00.410 --> 00:49:00.420 align:start position:0%
again if another crisis is created or
 
00:49:02.630 --> 00:49:02.640 align:start position:0%
happens the governor was very specific
 
00:49:05.630 --> 00:49:05.640 align:start position:0%
that he wanted to see this be this after
 
00:49:08.450 --> 00:49:08.460 align:start position:0%
action be a simple process for us to
 
00:49:10.010 --> 00:49:10.020 align:start position:0%
pull off the shelf and Implement again
 
00:49:12.770 --> 00:49:12.780 align:start position:0%
in the need of crisis and serve as a
 
00:49:16.069 --> 00:49:16.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:17.870 --> 00:49:17.880 align:start position:0%
I'm certainly open to any questions you
 
00:49:19.370 --> 00:49:19.380 align:start position:0%
might have or anything you'd like me to
 
00:49:19.380 --> 00:49:21.470 align:start position:0%
might have or anything you'd like me to
review

00:49:21.470 --> 00:49:21.480 align:start position:0%
review
 
00:49:23.109 --> 00:49:23.119 align:start position:0%
commission chair
 
00:49:25.569 --> 00:49:25.579 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards
 
00:49:28.790 --> 00:49:28.800 align:start position:0%
this this is something I have a decent
 
00:49:31.609 --> 00:49:31.619 align:start position:0%
amount of background in uh similar stuff
 
00:49:35.150 --> 00:49:35.160 align:start position:0%
and and so so I'd like to just if I may
 
00:49:36.410 --> 00:49:36.420 align:start position:0%
have kind of a little bit of a
 
00:49:38.210 --> 00:49:38.220 align:start position:0%
conversation yeah take some time without
 
00:49:43.010 --> 00:49:43.020 align:start position:0%
asking for uh oh okay so uh it it sounds
 
00:49:45.650 --> 00:49:45.660 align:start position:0%
like the the plan for what you're going
 
00:49:48.230 --> 00:49:48.240 align:start position:0%
to do with this after action is already
 
00:49:50.630 --> 00:49:50.640 align:start position:0%
embedded in a contract that's signed
 
00:49:50.640 --> 00:49:53.450 align:start position:0%
embedded in a contract that's signed
correct

00:49:53.450 --> 00:49:53.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:53.460 --> 00:49:56.569 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:49:56.569 --> 00:49:56.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:57.849 --> 00:49:57.859 align:start position:0%
um I think
 
00:50:01.250 --> 00:50:01.260 align:start position:0%
my reaction to that is that it's
 
00:50:03.710 --> 00:50:03.720 align:start position:0%
disappointing because I've been asking
 
00:50:06.349 --> 00:50:06.359 align:start position:0%
about this for a year and not that I
 
00:50:08.450 --> 00:50:08.460 align:start position:0%
have such a high opinion of my
 
00:50:11.990 --> 00:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
experience but as I look at this I have
 
00:50:13.910 --> 00:50:13.920 align:start position:0%
some negative reactions
 
00:50:17.390 --> 00:50:17.400 align:start position:0%
the on the areas of note under Logistics
 
00:50:20.930 --> 00:50:20.940 align:start position:0%
PPE where to find supplies this is sort
 
00:50:23.569 --> 00:50:23.579 align:start position:0%
of the classic military problem that we
 
00:50:26.710 --> 00:50:26.720 align:start position:0%
always prepare to fight the last war
 
00:50:30.950 --> 00:50:30.960 align:start position:0%
this area of note
 
00:50:34.370 --> 00:50:34.380 align:start position:0%
it seems to me to be exactly in that
 
00:50:36.829 --> 00:50:36.839 align:start position:0%
vein that we're expecting the next
 
00:50:41.450 --> 00:50:41.460 align:start position:0%
Crisis to look like this crisis and uh
 
00:50:44.089 --> 00:50:44.099 align:start position:0%
and and I and I think that sort of
 
00:50:48.349 --> 00:50:48.359 align:start position:0%
biases this and and in a way in which we
 
00:50:50.390 --> 00:50:50.400 align:start position:0%
we needed to take a look at some other
 
00:50:53.150 --> 00:50:53.160 align:start position:0%
issues like like what other issues
 
00:50:56.329 --> 00:50:56.339 align:start position:0%
I would say under areas of note and I
 
00:50:57.710 --> 00:50:57.720 align:start position:0%
don't even know why I'm saying this now
 
00:51:00.589 --> 00:51:00.599 align:start position:0%
since this is a contract but uh but it
 
00:51:01.970 --> 00:51:01.980 align:start position:0%
would be great if there were some
 
00:51:03.950 --> 00:51:03.960 align:start position:0%
flexibility in here because of the areas
 
00:51:05.510 --> 00:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
of note
 
00:51:09.589 --> 00:51:09.599 align:start position:0%
I would think that based on what we've
 
00:51:14.030 --> 00:51:14.040 align:start position:0%
learned from the CDC in the past year we
 
00:51:17.030 --> 00:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
ought to have and we knew at the time
 
00:51:19.609 --> 00:51:19.619 align:start position:0%
that we needed to do a better job of
 
00:51:22.510 --> 00:51:22.520 align:start position:0%
vetting and validating the Strategic
 
00:51:25.430 --> 00:51:25.440 align:start position:0%
guidance that we were getting from the
 
00:51:28.190 --> 00:51:28.200 align:start position:0%
federal government and that we needed to
 
00:51:32.089 --> 00:51:32.099 align:start position:0%
vet their top-down guidance internally a
 
00:51:35.030 --> 00:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
little bit and and with that sort of
 
00:51:37.130 --> 00:51:37.140 align:start position:0%
validation of strategy and top-down
 
00:51:39.829 --> 00:51:39.839 align:start position:0%
guidance we needed to do a much better
 
00:51:44.450 --> 00:51:44.460 align:start position:0%
job of sharing a reality-based policy
 
00:51:46.849 --> 00:51:46.859 align:start position:0%
set of policy decisions with the public
 
00:51:50.270 --> 00:51:50.280 align:start position:0%
one of the big disconnects in the in the
 
00:51:53.390 --> 00:51:53.400 align:start position:0%
whole response that this setup will not
 
00:51:56.270 --> 00:51:56.280 align:start position:0%
touch is
 
00:51:59.870 --> 00:51:59.880 align:start position:0%
the extent to which we're interacting
 
00:52:02.750 --> 00:52:02.760 align:start position:0%
with Federal authorities
 
00:52:05.270 --> 00:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
translating and validating it to New
 
00:52:08.270 --> 00:52:08.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and communicating with our
 
00:52:10.970 --> 00:52:10.980 align:start position:0%
citizens so that they better understand
 
00:52:13.910 --> 00:52:13.920 align:start position:0%
what we're doing to them
 
00:52:16.069 --> 00:52:16.079 align:start position:0%
to a lot of people it felt like we were
 
00:52:19.069 --> 00:52:19.079 align:start position:0%
doing something to them instead of with
 
00:52:21.950 --> 00:52:21.960 align:start position:0%
them and for them and and it just feels
 
00:52:24.349 --> 00:52:24.359 align:start position:0%
to me that the areas of note maybe
 
00:52:26.329 --> 00:52:26.339 align:start position:0%
should have picked picked up on that a
 
00:52:27.190 --> 00:52:27.200 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
00:52:29.990 --> 00:52:30.000 align:start position:0%
and I know that wasn't in the form of
 
00:52:33.290 --> 00:52:33.300 align:start position:0%
the question but um but but if I may I'd
 
00:52:35.690 --> 00:52:35.700 align:start position:0%
like to continue
 
00:52:38.450 --> 00:52:38.460 align:start position:0%
um let me put something in edgewise
 
00:52:41.150 --> 00:52:41.160 align:start position:0%
which I think maybe picks up on that to
 
00:52:43.370 --> 00:52:43.380 align:start position:0%
what degree can this committee
 
00:52:45.410 --> 00:52:45.420 align:start position:0%
meet with the company that has been
 
00:52:50.390 --> 00:52:50.400 align:start position:0%
hired to input to them or
 
00:52:52.549 --> 00:52:52.559 align:start position:0%
have they been hired and they're now
 
00:52:53.870 --> 00:52:53.880 align:start position:0%
turned loose
 
00:52:56.630 --> 00:52:56.640 align:start position:0%
no the committee was the company was
 
00:52:59.870 --> 00:52:59.880 align:start position:0%
hired and contracted with hsem to
 
00:53:02.390 --> 00:53:02.400 align:start position:0%
conduct this review I would have to
 
00:53:05.450 --> 00:53:05.460 align:start position:0%
check the RFP to see what the overall
 
00:53:07.309 --> 00:53:07.319 align:start position:0%
engagement with this committee would be
 
00:53:09.890 --> 00:53:09.900 align:start position:0%
I don't recall from the RFP if there was
 
00:53:12.650 --> 00:53:12.660 align:start position:0%
a direct call out for this group or not
 
00:53:14.750 --> 00:53:14.760 align:start position:0%
so that's the follow-up I might have to
 
00:53:16.490 --> 00:53:16.500 align:start position:0%
take away my follow-up is it doesn't
 
00:53:19.130 --> 00:53:19.140 align:start position:0%
necessarily have to be this group yeah
 
00:53:21.410 --> 00:53:21.420 align:start position:0%
but this sounds like the same top-down
 
00:53:23.630 --> 00:53:23.640 align:start position:0%
we know best
 
00:53:26.510 --> 00:53:26.520 align:start position:0%
kind of stuff that has angered a lot of
 
00:53:29.089 --> 00:53:29.099 align:start position:0%
people in the legislature
 
00:53:33.230 --> 00:53:33.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:35.630 --> 00:53:35.640 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards so thank you Mr
 
00:53:35.640 --> 00:53:36.530 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards so thank you Mr
chair

00:53:36.530 --> 00:53:36.540 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:53:40.370 --> 00:53:40.380 align:start position:0%
um and I'm so sorry I I I spent a career
 
00:53:43.010 --> 00:53:43.020 align:start position:0%
in the Army doing this sort of thing and
 
00:53:46.790 --> 00:53:46.800 align:start position:0%
so I I feel like I have some experience
 
00:53:49.190 --> 00:53:49.200 align:start position:0%
here on on the page where you've got
 
00:53:51.970 --> 00:53:51.980 align:start position:0%
response Focus areas
 
00:53:54.950 --> 00:53:54.960 align:start position:0%
there's a compliance and decision-making
 
00:53:58.010 --> 00:53:58.020 align:start position:0%
bubble and and that's that's kind of
 
00:54:00.430 --> 00:54:00.440 align:start position:0%
what I suggested could be an area of
 
00:54:02.870 --> 00:54:02.880 align:start position:0%
validation of the Strategic top-down
 
00:54:07.190 --> 00:54:07.200 align:start position:0%
guidance is is uh is is the decision
 
00:54:09.530 --> 00:54:09.540 align:start position:0%
making around that and how those
 
00:54:11.809 --> 00:54:11.819 align:start position:0%
decisions were made I don't know what
 
00:54:14.390 --> 00:54:14.400 align:start position:0%
the details are in that bubble but it
 
00:54:16.670 --> 00:54:16.680 align:start position:0%
may be that within the the contract
 
00:54:18.470 --> 00:54:18.480 align:start position:0%
that's already in place that that bubble
 
00:54:22.430 --> 00:54:22.440 align:start position:0%
could be further developed and then on
 
00:54:25.130 --> 00:54:25.140 align:start position:0%
the three bubbles that are sort of side
 
00:54:28.069 --> 00:54:28.079 align:start position:0%
by side here on that same page where it
 
00:54:30.170 --> 00:54:30.180 align:start position:0%
goes Communications information sharing
 
00:54:34.370 --> 00:54:34.380 align:start position:0%
situational awareness public information
 
00:54:36.650 --> 00:54:36.660 align:start position:0%
um this comes back to the other area of
 
00:54:38.470 --> 00:54:38.480 align:start position:0%
emphasis which is sharing the
 
00:54:41.210 --> 00:54:41.220 align:start position:0%
reality-based policies that are being
 
00:54:44.630 --> 00:54:44.640 align:start position:0%
developed uh with the public I I don't I
 
00:54:47.690 --> 00:54:47.700 align:start position:0%
I perceive that if a good AAR would
 
00:54:50.210 --> 00:54:50.220 align:start position:0%
reveal that we could do a better job of
 
00:54:53.450 --> 00:54:53.460 align:start position:0%
communicating to the public while why we
 
00:54:55.069 --> 00:54:55.079 align:start position:0%
are implementing certain certain
 
00:54:57.829 --> 00:54:57.839 align:start position:0%
policies and limiting and curtailing
 
00:55:00.829 --> 00:55:00.839 align:start position:0%
certain freedoms uh so that people
 
00:55:05.210 --> 00:55:05.220 align:start position:0%
understood what was happening and why
 
00:55:08.210 --> 00:55:08.220 align:start position:0%
um and so I would I would just point out
 
00:55:08.220 --> 00:55:09.829 align:start position:0%
um and so I would I would just point out
that

00:55:09.829 --> 00:55:09.839 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:55:12.470 --> 00:55:12.480 align:start position:0%
um that there there's a significant
 
00:55:14.210 --> 00:55:14.220 align:start position:0%
amount of communication that would be
 
00:55:16.450 --> 00:55:16.460 align:start position:0%
needed I think with the legislature
 
00:55:19.490 --> 00:55:19.500 align:start position:0%
particularly around superseding and
 
00:55:22.010 --> 00:55:22.020 align:start position:0%
establishing emergency orders because
 
00:55:24.650 --> 00:55:24.660 align:start position:0%
that's a suspension of our form of
 
00:55:26.569 --> 00:55:26.579 align:start position:0%
government when we enter into that sort
 
00:55:30.230 --> 00:55:30.240 align:start position:0%
of emergency Authority and and and I I
 
00:55:32.390 --> 00:55:32.400 align:start position:0%
believe that we really ought to take a
 
00:55:36.010 --> 00:55:36.020 align:start position:0%
serious look in the same they are at
 
00:55:39.950 --> 00:55:39.960 align:start position:0%
how the political body of the state
 
00:55:42.470 --> 00:55:42.480 align:start position:0%
interacted with each other to make sure
 
00:55:46.250 --> 00:55:46.260 align:start position:0%
that the public had their their rights
 
00:55:50.450 --> 00:55:50.460 align:start position:0%
preserved and um and and were part of of
 
00:55:52.609 --> 00:55:52.619 align:start position:0%
our comprehensive dealing with the
 
00:55:54.650 --> 00:55:54.660 align:start position:0%
crisis so
 
00:55:57.170 --> 00:55:57.180 align:start position:0%
um so I would I would have wanted to
 
00:56:00.109 --> 00:56:00.119 align:start position:0%
have participated in drafting the RFP or
 
00:56:01.790 --> 00:56:01.800 align:start position:0%
at least put some feedback in there I'm
 
00:56:03.650 --> 00:56:03.660 align:start position:0%
really concerned that this thing's
 
00:56:06.230 --> 00:56:06.240 align:start position:0%
already been let and uh and we're going
 
00:56:09.589 --> 00:56:09.599 align:start position:0%
to get an expensive document that
 
00:56:12.650 --> 00:56:12.660 align:start position:0%
creates a new plan hoping that the past
 
00:56:15.530 --> 00:56:15.540 align:start position:0%
crisis happens exactly like it did so
 
00:56:17.690 --> 00:56:17.700 align:start position:0%
that we can deal with it rather than
 
00:56:20.930 --> 00:56:20.940 align:start position:0%
building on a set of principles so that
 
00:56:23.990 --> 00:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
we know how to react as uh as a as an
 
00:56:26.809 --> 00:56:26.819 align:start position:0%
organized society and not not just a
 
00:56:29.990 --> 00:56:30.000 align:start position:0%
top-down control structure and then and
 
00:56:32.089 --> 00:56:32.099 align:start position:0%
that's and that's and to make that a
 
00:56:34.790 --> 00:56:34.800 align:start position:0%
question so what do you think of all of
 
00:56:34.800 --> 00:56:36.790 align:start position:0%
question so what do you think of all of
that

00:56:36.790 --> 00:56:36.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:56:41.510 --> 00:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
so a little bit about me as a person
 
00:56:43.910 --> 00:56:43.920 align:start position:0%
um I did not draft the RFP that is
 
00:56:46.490 --> 00:56:46.500 align:start position:0%
before you today uh this is a an
 
00:56:49.430 --> 00:56:49.440 align:start position:0%
inherited project but uh for those of
 
00:56:52.130 --> 00:56:52.140 align:start position:0%
you that don't know my history I spent
 
00:56:55.250 --> 00:56:55.260 align:start position:0%
30 years as a municipal Public Service
 
00:56:57.589 --> 00:56:57.599 align:start position:0%
employee so as a fire chief Emergency
 
00:56:59.150 --> 00:56:59.160 align:start position:0%
Management director and a public health
 
00:57:00.710 --> 00:57:00.720 align:start position:0%
officer in a community in the southern
 
00:57:03.109 --> 00:57:03.119 align:start position:0%
part of the state so I was inheriting
 
00:57:04.910 --> 00:57:04.920 align:start position:0%
all of those things as we were
 
00:57:06.530 --> 00:57:06.540 align:start position:0%
developing the plan and flying the plane
 
00:57:08.870 --> 00:57:08.880 align:start position:0%
as we're building at the same time I
 
00:57:10.430 --> 00:57:10.440 align:start position:0%
would tell you looking at the areas that
 
00:57:11.630 --> 00:57:11.640 align:start position:0%
you pointed out that was going to be my
 
00:57:13.730 --> 00:57:13.740 align:start position:0%
exact point that I believe that when you
 
00:57:15.950 --> 00:57:15.960 align:start position:0%
look at the the decision-making
 
00:57:17.450 --> 00:57:17.460 align:start position:0%
processes and all those things that
 
00:57:18.770 --> 00:57:18.780 align:start position:0%
would be an expectation that I would
 
00:57:20.270 --> 00:57:20.280 align:start position:0%
have that we would be examining how
 
00:57:22.430 --> 00:57:22.440 align:start position:0%
those things got done so that is I
 
00:57:25.190 --> 00:57:25.200 align:start position:0%
believe part of the AAR will be reviewed
 
00:57:26.750 --> 00:57:26.760 align:start position:0%
is what that decision-making process
 
00:57:28.930 --> 00:57:28.940 align:start position:0%
looked like and how that was developed
 
00:57:31.250 --> 00:57:31.260 align:start position:0%
so I bring a little bit different of a
 
00:57:33.770 --> 00:57:33.780 align:start position:0%
spin today than may have originally been
 
00:57:37.069 --> 00:57:37.079 align:start position:0%
attended uh when it was put together so
 
00:57:39.410 --> 00:57:39.420 align:start position:0%
I hear those things that you're saying
 
00:57:42.849 --> 00:57:42.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:45.650 --> 00:57:45.660 align:start position:0%
thank you and I uh hearing that I'm
 
00:57:47.930 --> 00:57:47.940 align:start position:0%
somewhat more reassured by the issue of
 
00:57:50.390 --> 00:57:50.400 align:start position:0%
local knowledge but
 
00:57:52.430 --> 00:57:52.440 align:start position:0%
um I and I think you're carrying hearing
 
00:57:54.170 --> 00:57:54.180 align:start position:0%
some Flack and some frustration from
 
00:57:55.730 --> 00:57:55.740 align:start position:0%
this committee about several other
 
00:57:58.609 --> 00:57:58.619 align:start position:0%
projects where there was a company
 
00:58:01.370 --> 00:58:01.380 align:start position:0%
brought in from away who have told us
 
00:58:05.030 --> 00:58:05.040 align:start position:0%
how to do things and they have had
 
00:58:07.849 --> 00:58:07.859 align:start position:0%
minimal input from the people whose
 
00:58:11.750 --> 00:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
lives are affected by it and so I kind
 
00:58:15.109 --> 00:58:15.119 align:start position:0%
of wanted to put what I think to build
 
00:58:17.450 --> 00:58:17.460 align:start position:0%
on what both Representatives Pearson and
 
00:58:19.329 --> 00:58:19.339 align:start position:0%
Edwards are saying
 
00:58:23.410 --> 00:58:23.420 align:start position:0%
making a plea for local input
 
00:58:27.890 --> 00:58:27.900 align:start position:0%
and for again working for I think one of
 
00:58:29.030 --> 00:58:29.040 align:start position:0%
the things that we're all talking about
 
00:58:32.390 --> 00:58:32.400 align:start position:0%
is buy-in from the community and that's
 
00:58:34.849 --> 00:58:34.859 align:start position:0%
Consulting the community and informing
 
00:58:36.410 --> 00:58:36.420 align:start position:0%
the community and making the community
 
00:58:40.490 --> 00:58:40.500 align:start position:0%
feel that they are a part of the
 
00:58:43.130 --> 00:58:43.140 align:start position:0%
solution as well as just being told what
 
00:58:47.329 --> 00:58:47.339 align:start position:0%
to do because once they understand why
 
00:58:48.829 --> 00:58:48.839 align:start position:0%
they're being asked to do something
 
00:58:51.530 --> 00:58:51.540 align:start position:0%
difficult my experience of granite
 
00:58:53.270 --> 00:58:53.280 align:start position:0%
Staters is they rally around and they're
 
00:58:55.730 --> 00:58:55.740 align:start position:0%
magnificent and you know I'm thinking
 
00:58:58.910 --> 00:58:58.920 align:start position:0%
about the people who were making masks
 
00:59:01.910 --> 00:59:01.920 align:start position:0%
and sewing lab coats because we didn't
 
00:59:06.109 --> 00:59:06.119 align:start position:0%
have any and there we are using 18 you
 
00:59:09.109 --> 00:59:09.119 align:start position:0%
know 1910 technology for a 20th century
 
00:59:13.490 --> 00:59:13.500 align:start position:0%
problem so I I do hope that it will be
 
00:59:17.170 --> 00:59:17.180 align:start position:0%
communicated very clearly to Title Basin
 
00:59:20.569 --> 00:59:20.579 align:start position:0%
that some of the data collection needs
 
00:59:23.690 --> 00:59:23.700 align:start position:0%
to be the experiences of local people
 
00:59:26.750 --> 00:59:26.760 align:start position:0%
and what they were dealing with and not
 
00:59:28.910 --> 00:59:28.920 align:start position:0%
just the experiences necessarily of
 
00:59:33.650 --> 00:59:33.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:36.170 --> 00:59:36.180 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant next and then
 
00:59:37.910 --> 00:59:37.920 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards thank you thank
 
00:59:40.910 --> 00:59:40.920 align:start position:0%
you Mr I looked at the Timeline which is
 
00:59:44.089 --> 00:59:44.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:46.309 --> 00:59:46.319 align:start position:0%
what will be the process to provide this
 
00:59:46.319 --> 00:59:47.450 align:start position:0%
what will be the process to provide this
committee

00:59:47.450 --> 00:59:47.460 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:59:49.849 --> 00:59:49.859 align:start position:0%
periodic updates as we go from phase one
 
00:59:53.230 --> 00:59:53.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:56.089 --> 00:59:56.099 align:start position:0%
great question and I would I'm going to
 
00:59:57.470 --> 00:59:57.480 align:start position:0%
Turf that one right over to the
 
00:59:59.750 --> 00:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
commissioner of DHHS and ask for what
 
01:00:01.490 --> 01:00:01.500 align:start position:0%
the reporting requirement may be I'm
 
01:00:03.170 --> 01:00:03.180 align:start position:0%
issue the commissioner I think is left
 
01:00:04.970 --> 01:00:04.980 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry so we would have to work that
 
01:00:06.770 --> 01:00:06.780 align:start position:0%
out with the with the agency to see what
 
01:00:08.210 --> 01:00:08.220 align:start position:0%
they want for a reporting mechanism
 
01:00:10.730 --> 01:00:10.740 align:start position:0%
moving forward uh through the contract
 
01:00:14.569 --> 01:00:14.579 align:start position:0%
uh the phases uh don't necessarily uh
 
01:00:17.210 --> 01:00:17.220 align:start position:0%
call for report outs so we can develop
 
01:00:19.970 --> 01:00:19.980 align:start position:0%
that as we move forward that's thank you
 
01:00:21.530 --> 01:00:21.540 align:start position:0%
but that would be in the RFP what I'm
 
01:00:23.329 --> 01:00:23.339 align:start position:0%
asking is not what's in the IRP what the
 
01:00:25.130 --> 01:00:25.140 align:start position:0%
department does as far as reporting back
 
01:00:31.870 --> 01:00:31.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:34.250 --> 01:00:34.260 align:start position:0%
so I'm sitting on this project committee
 
01:00:37.370 --> 01:00:37.380 align:start position:0%
as well and so I am keep
 
01:00:39.289 --> 01:00:39.299 align:start position:0%
the commissioner informed and I'm happy
 
01:00:40.609 --> 01:00:40.619 align:start position:0%
to work with her to make sure that we
 
01:00:41.870 --> 01:00:41.880 align:start position:0%
have a Cadence of updates for this
 
01:00:43.970 --> 01:00:43.980 align:start position:0%
committee throughout the process
 
01:00:47.089 --> 01:00:47.099 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards thank you Mr
 
01:00:47.099 --> 01:00:47.870 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards thank you Mr
chair

01:00:47.870 --> 01:00:47.880 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:00:50.329 --> 01:00:50.339 align:start position:0%
um so since this contract has been
 
01:00:52.789 --> 01:00:52.799 align:start position:0%
signed there should be something that
 
01:00:55.370 --> 01:00:55.380 align:start position:0%
I've called in the past a statement of
 
01:00:57.950 --> 01:00:57.960 align:start position:0%
work the the section c and the federal
 
01:00:59.690 --> 01:00:59.700 align:start position:0%
government I don't know what it is in
 
01:01:01.970 --> 01:01:01.980 align:start position:0%
state government but the there's very
 
01:01:05.030 --> 01:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
specific deliverables uh could could we
 
01:01:08.569 --> 01:01:08.579 align:start position:0%
get a copy a digitally sent to us of
 
01:01:10.130 --> 01:01:10.140 align:start position:0%
what the statement of work is for this
 
01:01:11.930 --> 01:01:11.940 align:start position:0%
contract yeah absolutely we can get you
 
01:01:13.430 --> 01:01:13.440 align:start position:0%
a copy of the entire contract and call
 
01:01:15.589 --> 01:01:15.599 align:start position:0%
that else no no no no no you just want
 
01:01:17.569 --> 01:01:17.579 align:start position:0%
that one second I want the section that
 
01:01:19.849 --> 01:01:19.859 align:start position:0%
says we can certainly get that to you
 
01:01:21.589 --> 01:01:21.599 align:start position:0%
right right I don't want to go to law
 
01:01:23.990 --> 01:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
school to read the boilerplate I just
 
01:01:26.750 --> 01:01:26.760 align:start position:0%
want to know what the okay all right
 
01:01:28.430 --> 01:01:28.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:01:30.049 --> 01:01:30.059 align:start position:0%
I was one of
 
01:01:36.049 --> 01:01:36.059 align:start position:0%
30 legislators that spent four days
 
01:01:38.390 --> 01:01:38.400 align:start position:0%
I won't say where it was in Atlanta I
 
01:01:39.890 --> 01:01:39.900 align:start position:0%
mean I won't say what the organization
 
01:01:42.289 --> 01:01:42.299 align:start position:0%
was but it's based in Atlanta
 
01:01:46.309 --> 01:01:46.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:51.289 --> 01:01:51.299 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:54.109 --> 01:01:54.119 align:start position:0%
and when we finally got a chance to
 
01:01:54.119 --> 01:01:55.309 align:start position:0%
and when we finally got a chance to
respond

01:01:55.309 --> 01:01:55.319 align:start position:0%
respond
 
01:01:58.750 --> 01:01:58.760 align:start position:0%
from the most Progressive to the most
 
01:02:03.890 --> 01:02:03.900 align:start position:0%
Arch conservative members of the group
 
01:02:05.569 --> 01:02:05.579 align:start position:0%
we were angry
 
01:02:07.970 --> 01:02:07.980 align:start position:0%
not necessarily at some of the decisions
 
01:02:10.430 --> 01:02:10.440 align:start position:0%
that were made in an emergency in real
 
01:02:10.440 --> 01:02:11.690 align:start position:0%
that were made in an emergency in real
time

01:02:11.690 --> 01:02:11.700 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:02:14.030 --> 01:02:14.040 align:start position:0%
but the tenure
 
01:02:17.270 --> 01:02:17.280 align:start position:0%
we were angry at the attitude I don't
 
01:02:19.789 --> 01:02:19.799 align:start position:0%
want to be angry here
 
01:02:21.650 --> 01:02:21.660 align:start position:0%
I want
 
01:02:24.289 --> 01:02:24.299 align:start position:0%
stakeholders and I understand it's
 
01:02:26.809 --> 01:02:26.819 align:start position:0%
sometimes difficult to work on a project
 
01:02:28.910 --> 01:02:28.920 align:start position:0%
and have a discussion when you have too
 
01:02:31.130 --> 01:02:31.140 align:start position:0%
many other folks wanting to jump in
 
01:02:33.230 --> 01:02:33.240 align:start position:0%
right away I get that I share things I
 
01:02:35.690 --> 01:02:35.700 align:start position:0%
know how that feels but on the other
 
01:02:40.549 --> 01:02:40.559 align:start position:0%
hand as things are released at the end
 
01:02:42.770 --> 01:02:42.780 align:start position:0%
I want to say this was a collaborative
 
01:02:45.109 --> 01:02:45.119 align:start position:0%
effort and while I don't agree with
 
01:02:46.809 --> 01:02:46.819 align:start position:0%
everything here I agree with the process
 
01:02:49.910 --> 01:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
I felt listens to I felt lots of people
 
01:02:51.950 --> 01:02:51.960 align:start position:0%
were listened to that's what I want to
 
01:02:53.450 --> 01:02:53.460 align:start position:0%
be able to say
 
01:02:58.670 --> 01:02:58.680 align:start position:0%
as much as I like the conclusions so
 
01:03:00.589 --> 01:03:00.599 align:start position:0%
if I could add one thing at least one of
 
01:03:02.329 --> 01:03:02.339 align:start position:0%
the things that we did add during the
 
01:03:04.309 --> 01:03:04.319 align:start position:0%
initial conversation with them was
 
01:03:06.049 --> 01:03:06.059 align:start position:0%
specific to your comment regarding
 
01:03:08.569 --> 01:03:08.579 align:start position:0%
surveying of the local municipalities
 
01:03:10.370 --> 01:03:10.380 align:start position:0%
and and getting a survey out the local
 
01:03:11.750 --> 01:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
level make sure we have that information
 
01:03:14.510 --> 01:03:14.520 align:start position:0%
coming so that that process to reaching
 
01:03:16.670 --> 01:03:16.680 align:start position:0%
down and getting down to the local level
 
01:03:19.430 --> 01:03:19.440 align:start position:0%
is already underway
 
01:03:22.010 --> 01:03:22.020 align:start position:0%
but I will say positively that during
 
01:03:24.109 --> 01:03:24.119 align:start position:0%
the pandemic there was something that
 
01:03:27.049 --> 01:03:27.059 align:start position:0%
was coming down from on high and I
 
01:03:29.030 --> 01:03:29.040 align:start position:0%
called up and since I've known that
 
01:03:31.069 --> 01:03:31.079 align:start position:0%
person I was in Health and Human
 
01:03:32.990 --> 01:03:33.000 align:start position:0%
Services committee for six years still
 
01:03:36.109 --> 01:03:36.119 align:start position:0%
keep up with that some of the folks
 
01:03:38.030 --> 01:03:38.040 align:start position:0%
um I picked up the phone called somebody
 
01:03:39.410 --> 01:03:39.420 align:start position:0%
and said
 
01:03:41.510 --> 01:03:41.520 align:start position:0%
you don't want to do that you really
 
01:03:44.270 --> 01:03:44.280 align:start position:0%
don't and I gave reasons why and we had
 
01:03:46.910 --> 01:03:46.920 align:start position:0%
a good conversation and I didn't get
 
01:03:49.250 --> 01:03:49.260 align:start position:0%
everything I wanted but I got listened
 
01:03:52.130 --> 01:03:52.140 align:start position:0%
to and taken seriously and not the brush
 
01:03:54.230 --> 01:03:54.240 align:start position:0%
off and sounds like they were listening
 
01:03:57.349 --> 01:03:57.359 align:start position:0%
but they weren't and what came out was
 
01:04:00.589 --> 01:04:00.599 align:start position:0%
responsive and you know that kind of
 
01:04:03.890 --> 01:04:03.900 align:start position:0%
makes me to some degree a DHHS groupie
 
01:04:06.470 --> 01:04:06.480 align:start position:0%
so I want to give that part of it too
 
01:04:10.309 --> 01:04:10.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:13.730 --> 01:04:13.740 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards okay so in terms
 
01:04:17.450 --> 01:04:17.460 align:start position:0%
of stakeholders uh I I I've had an
 
01:04:21.349 --> 01:04:21.359 align:start position:0%
opportunity to observe that Civilization
 
01:04:24.470 --> 01:04:24.480 align:start position:0%
is far more fragile than most Americans
 
01:04:28.670 --> 01:04:28.680 align:start position:0%
perceive and one of the things that
 
01:04:31.309 --> 01:04:31.319 align:start position:0%
happened because of the way we were
 
01:04:35.569 --> 01:04:35.579 align:start position:0%
doing the exact executive orders and and
 
01:04:39.289 --> 01:04:39.299 align:start position:0%
creating promulgating new restrictions
 
01:04:42.170 --> 01:04:42.180 align:start position:0%
was creating
 
01:04:44.530 --> 01:04:44.540 align:start position:0%
um a Bottoms Up
 
01:04:47.870 --> 01:04:47.880 align:start position:0%
kind of mob attitude
 
01:04:50.089 --> 01:04:50.099 align:start position:0%
um I I I hate using the word
 
01:04:50.099 --> 01:04:51.829 align:start position:0%
um I I I hate using the word
insurrectionist

01:04:51.829 --> 01:04:51.839 align:start position:0%
insurrectionist
 
01:04:56.750 --> 01:04:56.760 align:start position:0%
um but but there were we we fed into uh
 
01:05:00.829 --> 01:05:00.839 align:start position:0%
this sort of angst and anger uh and it
 
01:05:03.530 --> 01:05:03.540 align:start position:0%
had the restrictions been more severe or
 
01:05:07.250 --> 01:05:07.260 align:start position:0%
more prolonged uh I I don't know I I I
 
01:05:11.030 --> 01:05:11.040 align:start position:0%
did not like the the social chemistry
 
01:05:13.490 --> 01:05:13.500 align:start position:0%
that was taking place that could
 
01:05:16.849 --> 01:05:16.859 align:start position:0%
potentially lead to violence so what so
 
01:05:20.569 --> 01:05:20.579 align:start position:0%
what I would ask this AAR to do and go
 
01:05:23.089 --> 01:05:23.099 align:start position:0%
talk to some other shareholders in those
 
01:05:25.789 --> 01:05:25.799 align:start position:0%
sort of agitator communities like
 
01:05:27.950 --> 01:05:27.960 align:start position:0%
rebuild New Hampshire has calmed down
 
01:05:30.589 --> 01:05:30.599 align:start position:0%
quite a bit there's probably some groups
 
01:05:32.870 --> 01:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
we could get you hooked up with go talk
 
01:05:36.289 --> 01:05:36.299 align:start position:0%
to the people who were hostile about
 
01:05:38.870 --> 01:05:38.880 align:start position:0%
what happened to listen to them on on
 
01:05:42.410 --> 01:05:42.420 align:start position:0%
why they got so spun up so that the next
 
01:05:44.990 --> 01:05:45.000 align:start position:0%
time we do this we have a little bit of
 
01:05:48.370 --> 01:05:48.380 align:start position:0%
sensitivity to try to
 
01:05:51.770 --> 01:05:51.780 align:start position:0%
build those bridges before somebody's
 
01:05:54.770 --> 01:05:54.780 align:start position:0%
you know goes there's no Bridge here so
 
01:05:56.990 --> 01:05:57.000 align:start position:0%
you know so so you mentioned
 
01:05:58.970 --> 01:05:58.980 align:start position:0%
municipalities could be potential
 
01:06:01.190 --> 01:06:01.200 align:start position:0%
shareholders stakeholders that's great
 
01:06:03.289 --> 01:06:03.299 align:start position:0%
but I I don't think that's it's it's
 
01:06:05.930 --> 01:06:05.940 align:start position:0%
necessary but not sufficient I think you
 
01:06:08.210 --> 01:06:08.220 align:start position:0%
need to reach out and and get into the
 
01:06:10.609 --> 01:06:10.619 align:start position:0%
communities of hostility and and listen
 
01:06:12.109 --> 01:06:12.119 align:start position:0%
to them
 
01:06:12.119 --> 01:06:13.490 align:start position:0%
to them
so

01:06:13.490 --> 01:06:13.500 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:06:16.309 --> 01:06:16.319 align:start position:0%
is that possible or or is your
 
01:06:19.789 --> 01:06:19.799 align:start position:0%
stakeholder sphere already scoped
 
01:06:22.309 --> 01:06:22.319 align:start position:0%
I think the local municipalities are the
 
01:06:24.230 --> 01:06:24.240 align:start position:0%
gateway to getting to those groups to be
 
01:06:26.150 --> 01:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
honest with you it well they're going to
 
01:06:28.549 --> 01:06:28.559 align:start position:0%
highlight you know you can go and
 
01:06:31.370 --> 01:06:31.380 align:start position:0%
highlight and watch who's participating
 
01:06:33.109 --> 01:06:33.119 align:start position:0%
at the local level whether it's at a
 
01:06:34.370 --> 01:06:34.380 align:start position:0%
board meeting or school board meeting
 
01:06:36.950 --> 01:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
and highlight those groups and be able
 
01:06:39.170 --> 01:06:39.180 align:start position:0%
to figure that piece out so let's let us
 
01:06:40.970 --> 01:06:40.980 align:start position:0%
take a look at that I I hear the message
 
01:06:44.450 --> 01:06:44.460 align:start position:0%
I hear the ask and let's see what we can
 
01:06:46.430 --> 01:06:46.440 align:start position:0%
pull together on that I think that your
 
01:06:48.650 --> 01:06:48.660 align:start position:0%
message is crystal clear today in
 
01:06:50.750 --> 01:06:50.760 align:start position:0%
regards to what you're looking for for a
 
01:06:52.309 --> 01:06:52.319 align:start position:0%
stakeholder involvement and I I
 
01:06:54.069 --> 01:06:54.079 align:start position:0%
appreciate that
 
01:06:56.450 --> 01:06:56.460 align:start position:0%
other of you any of you familiar with
 
01:06:59.450 --> 01:06:59.460 align:start position:0%
the book the psychology of pandemics
 
01:07:02.150 --> 01:07:02.160 align:start position:0%
I'm not read it
 
01:07:04.190 --> 01:07:04.200 align:start position:0%
I would suggest
 
01:07:04.200 --> 01:07:05.690 align:start position:0%
I would suggest
um

01:07:05.690 --> 01:07:05.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:09.049 --> 01:07:09.059 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:11.210 --> 01:07:11.220 align:start position:0%
and as a people Watcher as a people
 
01:07:13.069 --> 01:07:13.079 align:start position:0%
person over the years
 
01:07:14.750 --> 01:07:14.760 align:start position:0%
that's something I know a little bit
 
01:07:16.309 --> 01:07:16.319 align:start position:0%
about is different kinds of people
 
01:07:17.990 --> 01:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
reacting in different ways under
 
01:07:19.609 --> 01:07:19.619 align:start position:0%
different stressors
 
01:07:21.950 --> 01:07:21.960 align:start position:0%
and with a couple of exceptions the
 
01:07:25.309 --> 01:07:25.319 align:start position:0%
author of this book nailed it in terms
 
01:07:27.230 --> 01:07:27.240 align:start position:0%
of the pandemic
 
01:07:29.029 --> 01:07:29.039 align:start position:0%
except it wasn't written during the
 
01:07:31.730 --> 01:07:31.740 align:start position:0%
pandemic It Was Written two years before
 
01:07:35.029 --> 01:07:35.039 align:start position:0%
him analyzing the flu epidemic of a
 
01:07:37.609 --> 01:07:37.619 align:start position:0%
hundred years ago Mars serves all of
 
01:07:39.710 --> 01:07:39.720 align:start position:0%
those and watching how different people
 
01:07:42.890 --> 01:07:42.900 align:start position:0%
react to authority figures to
 
01:07:45.410 --> 01:07:45.420 align:start position:0%
presentations of facts to all kinds of
 
01:07:48.109 --> 01:07:48.119 align:start position:0%
things and the people in the equation
 
01:07:50.750 --> 01:07:50.760 align:start position:0%
are as important as where the equipment
 
01:07:53.390 --> 01:07:53.400 align:start position:0%
can be found and I just suggest this
 
01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:54.589 align:start position:0%
can be found and I just suggest this
because

01:07:54.589 --> 01:07:54.599 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:07:54.599 --> 01:07:56.510 align:start position:0%
because
um

01:07:56.510 --> 01:07:56.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:58.370 --> 01:07:58.380 align:start position:0%
I'm part-time CEO of a Medical
 
01:08:00.710 --> 01:08:00.720 align:start position:0%
Counseling facility and we were ready
 
01:08:02.750 --> 01:08:02.760 align:start position:0%
for the pandemic not only in terms of
 
01:08:05.809 --> 01:08:05.819 align:start position:0%
equipment but in terms of doing studies
 
01:08:08.569 --> 01:08:08.579 align:start position:0%
of our patients how they are likely to
 
01:08:10.549 --> 01:08:10.559 align:start position:0%
react when the big one hits which we
 
01:08:13.250 --> 01:08:13.260 align:start position:0%
knew it was about to and because we knew
 
01:08:14.930 --> 01:08:14.940 align:start position:0%
them and because we thought not just
 
01:08:17.390 --> 01:08:17.400 align:start position:0%
about having supplies and coordinating
 
01:08:18.769 --> 01:08:18.779 align:start position:0%
off part of the building and all of
 
01:08:20.390 --> 01:08:20.400 align:start position:0%
those important things we needed to do
 
01:08:24.050 --> 01:08:24.060 align:start position:0%
but we did a psychological study of our
 
01:08:24.060 --> 01:08:25.430 align:start position:0%
but we did a psychological study of our
patients

01:08:25.430 --> 01:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
patients
 
01:08:25.440 --> 01:08:26.749 align:start position:0%
patients
so

01:08:26.749 --> 01:08:26.759 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:08:29.269 --> 01:08:29.279 align:start position:0%
we were right how they reacted but we
 
01:08:31.550 --> 01:08:31.560 align:start position:0%
were ready for them so psychology of a
 
01:08:33.709 --> 01:08:33.719 align:start position:0%
pandemic is an excellent read and will
 
01:08:37.130 --> 01:08:37.140 align:start position:0%
inform anything this group does
 
01:08:39.650 --> 01:08:39.660 align:start position:0%
um did I see representative Merchant
 
01:08:42.950 --> 01:08:42.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Mr Fox I want to say thank
 
01:08:44.209 --> 01:08:44.219 align:start position:0%
you for what you're doing
 
01:08:46.849 --> 01:08:46.859 align:start position:0%
um it's not an easy task obviously but
 
01:08:48.650 --> 01:08:48.660 align:start position:0%
in saying that one of the things I think
 
01:08:51.169 --> 01:08:51.179 align:start position:0%
a theme here I'm hearing and I would
 
01:08:53.390 --> 01:08:53.400 align:start position:0%
chime in on this as well
 
01:08:55.669 --> 01:08:55.679 align:start position:0%
this is well laid out dealing with a
 
01:08:58.010 --> 01:08:58.020 align:start position:0%
process but one of the key parts of a
 
01:09:01.130 --> 01:09:01.140 align:start position:0%
process is human beings and I don't see
 
01:09:02.930 --> 01:09:02.940 align:start position:0%
anything here dealing with the
 
01:09:04.370 --> 01:09:04.380 align:start position:0%
psychology of what you're trying to get
 
01:09:06.530 --> 01:09:06.540 align:start position:0%
to because that is underlying all of
 
01:09:08.329 --> 01:09:08.339 align:start position:0%
this when you get into a pandemic
 
01:09:10.849 --> 01:09:10.859 align:start position:0%
is trying to understand how the Public's
 
01:09:12.410 --> 01:09:12.420 align:start position:0%
going to react to certain things what
 
01:09:13.849 --> 01:09:13.859 align:start position:0%
kind of information we're going to have
 
01:09:16.430 --> 01:09:16.440 align:start position:0%
to communicate with the public I just
 
01:09:18.050 --> 01:09:18.060 align:start position:0%
would encourage you folks I know the RFP
 
01:09:20.090 --> 01:09:20.100 align:start position:0%
has probably even developed and signed
 
01:09:21.950 --> 01:09:21.960 align:start position:0%
but think about this you go through the
 
01:09:24.289 --> 01:09:24.299 align:start position:0%
processes how do we engage the public
 
01:09:26.570 --> 01:09:26.580 align:start position:0%
how do we try to at least understand the
 
01:09:28.430 --> 01:09:28.440 align:start position:0%
public because ultimately at the end of
 
01:09:30.470 --> 01:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
the day they're the ones that we need to
 
01:09:32.570 --> 01:09:32.580 align:start position:0%
take care of but a lot of times they
 
01:09:35.030 --> 01:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
don't come along willingly they have to
 
01:09:37.189 --> 01:09:37.199 align:start position:0%
basically be a lot of education and so
 
01:09:38.930 --> 01:09:38.940 align:start position:0%
forth with us are somewhere along the
 
01:09:41.749 --> 01:09:41.759 align:start position:0%
way you can in your side notes put that
 
01:09:44.510 --> 01:09:44.520 align:start position:0%
as a side note please
 
01:09:47.269 --> 01:09:47.279 align:start position:0%
thank you the author of the
 
01:09:49.689 --> 01:09:49.699 align:start position:0%
aforementioned book is Stephen with a V
 
01:09:52.789 --> 01:09:52.799 align:start position:0%
Stephen Taylor and it was published
 
01:09:52.799 --> 01:09:54.110 align:start position:0%
Stephen Taylor and it was published
interestingly

01:09:54.110 --> 01:09:54.120 align:start position:0%
interestingly
 
01:09:56.390 --> 01:09:56.400 align:start position:0%
October of 2019.
 
01:09:57.950 --> 01:09:57.960 align:start position:0%
just before
 
01:09:59.510 --> 01:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
01:10:01.930 --> 01:10:01.940 align:start position:0%
I just want to apologize
 
01:10:04.910 --> 01:10:04.920 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I want to apologize to our
 
01:10:08.209 --> 01:10:08.219 align:start position:0%
guests that I was I'm a little spun up
 
01:10:11.930 --> 01:10:11.940 align:start position:0%
on this issue it's taken me a year of
 
01:10:14.270 --> 01:10:14.280 align:start position:0%
twisting that and it just Unleashed on
 
01:10:17.930 --> 01:10:17.940 align:start position:0%
you so I apologize for the bluntness and
 
01:10:19.970 --> 01:10:19.980 align:start position:0%
directness and it wasn't meant to be
 
01:10:22.850 --> 01:10:22.860 align:start position:0%
accusatory I it's just accumulated
 
01:10:24.709 --> 01:10:24.719 align:start position:0%
frustration syndrome
 
01:10:26.510 --> 01:10:26.520 align:start position:0%
I appreciate you I appreciate your
 
01:10:30.229 --> 01:10:30.239 align:start position:0%
comments and I don't take it any harm 30
 
01:10:31.970 --> 01:10:31.980 align:start position:0%
years of dealing with municipal
 
01:10:34.370 --> 01:10:34.380 align:start position:0%
government I'm sure has built up an
 
01:10:37.070 --> 01:10:37.080 align:start position:0%
appropriate uh thin thick skin sir yes

supports and services
 
01:11:25.130 --> 01:11:25.140 align:start position:0%
I'm Sandy Pharos bureau chief of Bureau
 
01:11:27.229 --> 01:11:27.239 align:start position:0%
of Developmental services
 
01:11:28.850 --> 01:11:28.860 align:start position:0%
thank you for having us this afternoon
 
01:11:31.430 --> 01:11:31.440 align:start position:0%
to provide a quick update on the routine
 
01:11:34.550 --> 01:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
house bill 608. I apologize for saying
 
01:11:36.470 --> 01:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
I'm a groupie but go ahead oh no we like
 
01:11:38.450 --> 01:11:38.460 align:start position:0%
groupies we'll we'll take you on no
 
01:11:38.460 --> 01:11:39.890 align:start position:0%
groupies we'll we'll take you on no
problem

01:11:39.890 --> 01:11:39.900 align:start position:0%
problem
 
01:11:41.750 --> 01:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
um so I wanted to give a little update I
 
01:11:44.149 --> 01:11:44.159 align:start position:0%
know we presented last month as well for
 
01:11:45.530 --> 01:11:45.540 align:start position:0%
an update but
 
01:11:47.149 --> 01:11:47.159 align:start position:0%
um the biggest thing that's happened
 
01:11:49.910 --> 01:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
between then and now is we've started
 
01:11:52.910 --> 01:11:52.920 align:start position:0%
our cohort work as far as bringing the
 
01:11:56.090 --> 01:11:56.100 align:start position:0%
providers online so we have three
 
01:11:58.729 --> 01:11:58.739 align:start position:0%
cohorts of about 15 providers in each
 
01:12:02.630 --> 01:12:02.640 align:start position:0%
cohort that a leader from BDS is leading
 
01:12:05.090 --> 01:12:05.100 align:start position:0%
one of each of those cohorts
 
01:12:06.410 --> 01:12:06.420 align:start position:0%
um it started today so we had our
 
01:12:08.450 --> 01:12:08.460 align:start position:0%
kickoff meetings with the three cohorts
 
01:12:10.070 --> 01:12:10.080 align:start position:0%
this morning
 
01:12:11.510 --> 01:12:11.520 align:start position:0%
um and so it's really the shepherd
 
01:12:14.090 --> 01:12:14.100 align:start position:0%
providers on a smaller level to come on
 
01:12:16.010 --> 01:12:16.020 align:start position:0%
board with the direct billing process
 
01:12:18.530 --> 01:12:18.540 align:start position:0%
and answer their questions in a small
 
01:12:21.950 --> 01:12:21.960 align:start position:0%
group with targeted folks being
 
01:12:23.990 --> 01:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
available to respond to their questions
 
01:12:27.130 --> 01:12:27.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:29.689 --> 01:12:29.699 align:start position:0%
representative so we're talking about
 
01:12:32.750 --> 01:12:32.760 align:start position:0%
the same thing because I have had real
 
01:12:34.790 --> 01:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
difficulties wrapping my head around
 
01:12:36.050 --> 01:12:36.060 align:start position:0%
what we're saying when we're saying
 
01:12:39.050 --> 01:12:39.060 align:start position:0%
providers uh are we talking about Case
 
01:12:40.970 --> 01:12:40.980 align:start position:0%
Management Services are we talking about
 
01:12:45.050 --> 01:12:45.060 align:start position:0%
Direct Care Services what which sort of
 
01:12:47.810 --> 01:12:47.820 align:start position:0%
providers are we talking about and and
 
01:12:49.910 --> 01:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
if you could equate this with who's
 
01:12:51.590 --> 01:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
doing the providing now and what we're
 
01:12:53.270 --> 01:12:53.280 align:start position:0%
shifting to that would be very helpful
 
01:12:56.990 --> 01:12:57.000 align:start position:0%
for me sure so um before this time all
 
01:12:59.689 --> 01:12:59.699 align:start position:0%
of the area agencies were our Veterinary
 
01:13:01.370 --> 01:13:01.380 align:start position:0%
agencies in New Hampshire were really
 
01:13:04.250 --> 01:13:04.260 align:start position:0%
our primary contact who had contracts
 
01:13:07.610 --> 01:13:07.620 align:start position:0%
with providers that provided
 
01:13:08.630 --> 01:13:08.640 align:start position:0%
um you know it could have been day
 
01:13:11.050 --> 01:13:11.060 align:start position:0%
Services it could be Employment Services
 
01:13:13.250 --> 01:13:13.260 align:start position:0%
right exactly
 
01:13:14.810 --> 01:13:14.820 align:start position:0%
um so when when I'm speaking of
 
01:13:17.450 --> 01:13:17.460 align:start position:0%
providers we are now in direct contact
 
01:13:19.669 --> 01:13:19.679 align:start position:0%
with those providers that were typically
 
01:13:22.550 --> 01:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
contracted with the area agencies so
 
01:13:25.550 --> 01:13:25.560 align:start position:0%
that would be those community-based
 
01:13:28.189 --> 01:13:28.199 align:start position:0%
organizations that provide services to
 
01:13:30.709 --> 01:13:30.719 align:start position:0%
folks with developmental disabilities
 
01:13:32.870 --> 01:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
okay thank you yes
 
01:13:36.229 --> 01:13:36.239 align:start position:0%
um and so we believe that having these
 
01:13:38.090 --> 01:13:38.100 align:start position:0%
smaller cohort groups as we're coming
 
01:13:42.530 --> 01:13:42.540 align:start position:0%
online for for July 1st will provide a
 
01:13:45.590 --> 01:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
more one-on-one approach
 
01:13:47.930 --> 01:13:47.940 align:start position:0%
um to be able to answer questions that
 
01:13:49.850 --> 01:13:49.860 align:start position:0%
they have in troubleshoot in real time
 
01:13:52.550 --> 01:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
as far as any concerns as it relates to
 
01:13:55.610 --> 01:13:55.620 align:start position:0%
you know our information system billing
 
01:13:58.669 --> 01:13:58.679 align:start position:0%
processes enrollment status I'm so we're
 
01:14:00.470 --> 01:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
excited to report that that kicked off
 
01:14:04.490 --> 01:14:04.500 align:start position:0%
today uh based on the enrolled providers
 
01:14:05.990 --> 01:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
that we have
 
01:14:06.890 --> 01:14:06.900 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if there's anything you
 
01:14:08.930 --> 01:14:08.940 align:start position:0%
want to get into that Sandy
 
01:14:08.940 --> 01:14:10.490 align:start position:0%
want to get into that Sandy
visitature

01:14:10.490 --> 01:14:10.500 align:start position:0%
visitature
 
01:14:12.649 --> 01:14:12.659 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant to pick up this
 
01:14:15.050 --> 01:14:15.060 align:start position:0%
point sure thank you
 
01:14:16.790 --> 01:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
what I'm hearing if I understand it's
 
01:14:18.530 --> 01:14:18.540 align:start position:0%
correctly following up reps and Weber's
 
01:14:21.169 --> 01:14:21.179 align:start position:0%
comment the agencies were the ones
 
01:14:23.209 --> 01:14:23.219 align:start position:0%
coordinating the care before so the way
 
01:14:25.010 --> 01:14:25.020 align:start position:0%
it flowed was from the Department to the
 
01:14:26.689 --> 01:14:26.699 align:start position:0%
agency to the provider
 
01:14:29.270 --> 01:14:29.280 align:start position:0%
correct yes so the department to the
 
01:14:31.610 --> 01:14:31.620 align:start position:0%
area agency to the provider so now we're
 
01:14:32.810 --> 01:14:32.820 align:start position:0%
going from the Department directly to
 
01:14:34.790 --> 01:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
the provider yes and the area agencies
 
01:14:36.470 --> 01:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
are still involved some of them are
 
01:14:39.229 --> 01:14:39.239 align:start position:0%
providers as well of these Services
 
01:14:41.450 --> 01:14:41.460 align:start position:0%
um and they're still a very relevant
 
01:14:43.550 --> 01:14:43.560 align:start position:0%
role in our in our whole delivery system
 
01:14:46.310 --> 01:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
as far as intake and eligibility for
 
01:14:48.290 --> 01:14:48.300 align:start position:0%
people on the waiver providing support
 
01:14:51.050 --> 01:14:51.060 align:start position:0%
to individuals and families with
 
01:14:53.090 --> 01:14:53.100 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities but the real
 
01:14:55.550 --> 01:14:55.560 align:start position:0%
change is these providers will be able
 
01:14:57.950 --> 01:14:57.960 align:start position:0%
to directly Bill and not contract with
 
01:15:00.649 --> 01:15:00.659 align:start position:0%
the area agencies to provide service
 
01:15:02.390 --> 01:15:02.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:15:04.729 --> 01:15:04.739 align:start position:0%
please continue
 
01:15:08.330 --> 01:15:08.340 align:start position:0%
um so we also are excited to have
 
01:15:11.750 --> 01:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
um scheduled some more family in-person
 
01:15:14.689 --> 01:15:14.699 align:start position:0%
um engagements not only in person but
 
01:15:16.669 --> 01:15:16.679 align:start position:0%
we're also going to do virtual sessions
 
01:15:19.130 --> 01:15:19.140 align:start position:0%
to engage individuals and families with
 
01:15:21.590 --> 01:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
disabilities about any concerns or
 
01:15:23.750 --> 01:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
questions that they may have
 
01:15:26.330 --> 01:15:26.340 align:start position:0%
um with the 7-1
 
01:15:28.850 --> 01:15:28.860 align:start position:0%
um rollout but also Beyond so
 
01:15:30.350 --> 01:15:30.360 align:start position:0%
um really trying to connect to those
 
01:15:32.090 --> 01:15:32.100 align:start position:0%
people in the community who are actually
 
01:15:34.970 --> 01:15:34.980 align:start position:0%
receiving the services and having that
 
01:15:37.250 --> 01:15:37.260 align:start position:0%
direct dialogue with them so we're
 
01:15:39.770 --> 01:15:39.780 align:start position:0%
planning some in-person meetings in June
 
01:15:43.270 --> 01:15:43.280 align:start position:0%
we're also having some online
 
01:15:47.450 --> 01:15:47.460 align:start position:0%
conversations as well as a video that
 
01:15:49.430 --> 01:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
they can watch as far as you know what
 
01:15:51.350 --> 01:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
is direct Bill and what does that mean
 
01:15:53.390 --> 01:15:53.400 align:start position:0%
to me as a family member or an
 
01:15:56.570 --> 01:15:56.580 align:start position:0%
individual receiving services
 
01:15:56.580 --> 01:15:58.450 align:start position:0%
individual receiving services
foreign

01:15:58.450 --> 01:15:58.460 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:16:01.430 --> 01:16:01.440 align:start position:0%
thank you you want that
 
01:16:03.130 --> 01:16:03.140 align:start position:0%
thank you so much
 
01:16:06.649 --> 01:16:06.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:08.810 --> 01:16:08.820 align:start position:0%
given the fact that I'm going back to
 
01:16:11.090 --> 01:16:11.100 align:start position:0%
what talked about before on the provider
 
01:16:15.290 --> 01:16:15.300 align:start position:0%
and the change from the agency to direct
 
01:16:17.149 --> 01:16:17.159 align:start position:0%
contract with you over the provider
 
01:16:19.490 --> 01:16:19.500 align:start position:0%
who's doing the actual care
 
01:16:22.790 --> 01:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
how is the agency being funded because I
 
01:16:24.410 --> 01:16:24.420 align:start position:0%
would make the Assumption before when
 
01:16:26.390 --> 01:16:26.400 align:start position:0%
they're doing the billing they probably
 
01:16:28.610 --> 01:16:28.620 align:start position:0%
were taking a certain percentage of the
 
01:16:30.410 --> 01:16:30.420 align:start position:0%
billing to support the agency so are we
 
01:16:32.330 --> 01:16:32.340 align:start position:0%
going to disrupt the agencies because
 
01:16:33.649 --> 01:16:33.659 align:start position:0%
they don't have a
 
01:16:36.350 --> 01:16:36.360 align:start position:0%
a funding mechanism to keep themselves
 
01:16:39.050 --> 01:16:39.060 align:start position:0%
afloat so we've worked with the area
 
01:16:41.030 --> 01:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
agencies to develop a Medicaid
 
01:16:43.510 --> 01:16:43.520 align:start position:0%
administrative rate for those Services
 
01:16:47.510 --> 01:16:47.520 align:start position:0%
which was funded and we're waiting for
 
01:16:50.090 --> 01:16:50.100 align:start position:0%
CMS to give us the official stamp of
 
01:16:52.910 --> 01:16:52.920 align:start position:0%
approval on that methodology but we did
 
01:16:55.130 --> 01:16:55.140 align:start position:0%
take their costs into consideration in
 
01:16:56.810 --> 01:16:56.820 align:start position:0%
building that rate with a rate setting
 
01:16:58.970 --> 01:16:58.980 align:start position:0%
vendor thank you yes
 
01:17:01.270 --> 01:17:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:05.750 --> 01:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards so so I think to
 
01:17:08.149 --> 01:17:08.159 align:start position:0%
uh to the point that representative
 
01:17:12.610 --> 01:17:12.620 align:start position:0%
Merchant brings up or Marshawn uh that
 
01:17:16.130 --> 01:17:16.140 align:start position:0%
that this is an area of concern for the
 
01:17:19.669 --> 01:17:19.679 align:start position:0%
area agencies because they've adapted to
 
01:17:22.130 --> 01:17:22.140 align:start position:0%
a particular business model and this is
 
01:17:23.870 --> 01:17:23.880 align:start position:0%
a transition to a different kind of
 
01:17:28.850 --> 01:17:28.860 align:start position:0%
business model and it's it it it if you
 
01:17:32.030 --> 01:17:32.040 align:start position:0%
if you love economics it also interjects
 
01:17:35.750 --> 01:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
a new component instead of taking a
 
01:17:38.030 --> 01:17:38.040 align:start position:0%
share of their revenue to help fund
 
01:17:41.110 --> 01:17:41.120 align:start position:0%
their expenses it's now an admin
 
01:17:44.990 --> 01:17:45.000 align:start position:0%
administratively uh
 
01:17:48.709 --> 01:17:48.719 align:start position:0%
an administratively built developed a
 
01:17:51.950 --> 01:17:51.960 align:start position:0%
fee which gets to be more in a command
 
01:17:53.330 --> 01:17:53.340 align:start position:0%
and control
 
01:17:55.610 --> 01:17:55.620 align:start position:0%
kind of environment instead of a free
 
01:17:57.350 --> 01:17:57.360 align:start position:0%
market and so whether or not that's
 
01:17:59.390 --> 01:17:59.400 align:start position:0%
going to be adaptable and flexible over
 
01:18:01.970 --> 01:18:01.980 align:start position:0%
time I think it's just more challenging
 
01:18:05.209 --> 01:18:05.219 align:start position:0%
because you give up sort of um the
 
01:18:07.250 --> 01:18:07.260 align:start position:0%
breathing that goes with tying it to
 
01:18:10.310 --> 01:18:10.320 align:start position:0%
revenues I and and I I think the other
 
01:18:12.290 --> 01:18:12.300 align:start position:0%
thing that's going on in the economics
 
01:18:14.209 --> 01:18:14.219 align:start position:0%
of the area agencies that we should know
 
01:18:17.110 --> 01:18:17.120 align:start position:0%
a little bit about is that there are
 
01:18:20.209 --> 01:18:20.219 align:start position:0%
additional requirements for some I.T
 
01:18:22.070 --> 01:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
system development that's not part of
 
01:18:24.709 --> 01:18:24.719 align:start position:0%
your presentation today but in the one
 
01:18:27.410 --> 01:18:27.420 align:start position:0%
area agency's disclosure I'm on the
 
01:18:31.550 --> 01:18:31.560 align:start position:0%
board of one sky so I'm I'm I'm I'm not
 
01:18:34.669 --> 01:18:34.679 align:start position:0%
advocating I'm just trying to say what
 
01:18:37.490 --> 01:18:37.500 align:start position:0%
I've learned from that and that is that
 
01:18:39.709 --> 01:18:39.719 align:start position:0%
they they're spending like ten thousand
 
01:18:42.050 --> 01:18:42.060 align:start position:0%
dollars a month for their I.T systems in
 
01:18:43.970 --> 01:18:43.980 align:start position:0%
order to support the requirements of the
 
01:18:46.010 --> 01:18:46.020 align:start position:0%
department and that's going to go up to
 
01:18:49.850 --> 01:18:49.860 align:start position:0%
fifteen thousand dollars a month so it's
 
01:18:54.290 --> 01:18:54.300 align:start position:0%
a doubling of their expenses and and so
 
01:18:56.750 --> 01:18:56.760 align:start position:0%
um so so there's just a lot of concern
 
01:18:58.250 --> 01:18:58.260 align:start position:0%
out there amongst the area agencies
 
01:19:00.110 --> 01:19:00.120 align:start position:0%
whether or not you know they're going to
 
01:19:02.510 --> 01:19:02.520 align:start position:0%
be viable and and it may be that some of
 
01:19:04.070 --> 01:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
them need to go away because we don't
 
01:19:05.810 --> 01:19:05.820 align:start position:0%
need 10 in the future if we can direct
 
01:19:08.870 --> 01:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
bill but but that's the challenge I
 
01:19:12.350 --> 01:19:12.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:12.360 --> 01:19:15.850 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:19:15.850 --> 01:19:15.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:18.590 --> 01:19:18.600 align:start position:0%
representative McDonald thank you Mr
 
01:19:21.110 --> 01:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
chairman uh it's noticed in this week's
 
01:19:22.970 --> 01:19:22.980 align:start position:0%
calendar but um this week this coming
 
01:19:25.130 --> 01:19:25.140 align:start position:0%
week um the health and human services
 
01:19:26.870 --> 01:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
and elderly Affairs committee will be
 
01:19:28.970 --> 01:19:28.980 align:start position:0%
addressing our retained bills kind of
 
01:19:31.130 --> 01:19:31.140 align:start position:0%
mapping out the strategy you know in the
 
01:19:33.410 --> 01:19:33.420 align:start position:0%
anticipation of the Fall deadline and
 
01:19:35.930 --> 01:19:35.940 align:start position:0%
this obviously is on the list so
 
01:19:37.910 --> 01:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
um and I've got I've solicited feedback
 
01:19:39.350 --> 01:19:39.360 align:start position:0%
from committee members to see which
 
01:19:40.729 --> 01:19:40.739 align:start position:0%
bills they want to work on we've got
 
01:19:43.970 --> 01:19:43.980 align:start position:0%
about a dozen and uh you know we'll be
 
01:19:46.189 --> 01:19:46.199 align:start position:0%
sifting through that and planning our
 
01:19:48.530 --> 01:19:48.540 align:start position:0%
strategy but uh it's it's all very much
 
01:19:55.250 --> 01:19:55.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:57.410 --> 01:19:57.420 align:start position:0%
thank you for your report and especially
 
01:19:59.630 --> 01:19:59.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for
 
01:20:02.090 --> 01:20:02.100 align:start position:0%
your movement in listening to
 
01:20:04.669 --> 01:20:04.679 align:start position:0%
stakeholders again like there's so many
 
01:20:06.950 --> 01:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
things at least they want to be listened
 
01:20:08.450 --> 01:20:08.460 align:start position:0%
to and it sounds like you're making some
 
01:20:10.430 --> 01:20:10.440 align:start position:0%
good progress that way so thank you for
 
01:20:12.649 --> 01:20:12.659 align:start position:0%
that thank you okay
 
01:20:14.930 --> 01:20:14.940 align:start position:0%
you guys aren't done okay
 
01:20:16.970 --> 01:20:16.980 align:start position:0%
we are unless there's something you want
 
01:20:19.729 --> 01:20:19.739 align:start position:0%
to discuss well I was hoping done I was
 
01:20:22.610 --> 01:20:22.620 align:start position:0%
I was hoping that we could ask our
 
01:20:25.430 --> 01:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
monthly question about the uh the wait
 
01:20:27.530 --> 01:20:27.540 align:start position:0%
list the real wait list and what kind of
 
01:20:30.169 --> 01:20:30.179 align:start position:0%
metrics and statistics you can give us
 
01:20:32.510 --> 01:20:32.520 align:start position:0%
um would representative Jess Edwards
 
01:20:34.850 --> 01:20:34.860 align:start position:0%
like to ask our monthly question of our
 
01:20:37.189 --> 01:20:37.199 align:start position:0%
esteemed guests
 
01:20:39.490 --> 01:20:39.500 align:start position:0%
do you have any new
 
01:20:42.709 --> 01:20:42.719 align:start position:0%
graphics from data Force
 
01:20:45.169 --> 01:20:45.179 align:start position:0%
so we generally do the wait list every
 
01:20:47.630 --> 01:20:47.640 align:start position:0%
quarter so we did it last month I don't
 
01:20:50.090 --> 01:20:50.100 align:start position:0%
have any updated statistics for this
 
01:20:52.790 --> 01:20:52.800 align:start position:0%
quarter Mr chair Miss already told me
 
01:20:54.649 --> 01:20:54.659 align:start position:0%
that last month and I forgot it's a
 
01:20:56.630 --> 01:20:56.640 align:start position:0%
quarterly report thank you for giving
 
01:20:57.970 --> 01:20:57.980 align:start position:0%

development uh so we'll Begin by
 
01:22:13.490 --> 01:22:13.500 align:start position:0%
speaking about the goings-ons with the
 
01:22:15.169 --> 01:22:15.179 align:start position:0%
uh the new dental adult Dental benefit
 
01:22:18.229 --> 01:22:18.239 align:start position:0%
and then we'll transition to
 
01:22:21.530 --> 01:22:21.540 align:start position:0%
um some updates on SB 263 which you you
 
01:22:23.149 --> 01:22:23.159 align:start position:0%
may be aware of
 
01:22:23.159 --> 01:22:23.460 align:start position:0%
may be aware of
um

01:22:23.460 --> 01:22:23.470 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:23.470 --> 01:22:29.660 align:start position:0%
um
[Laughter]

01:22:29.660 --> 01:22:29.670 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:29.670 --> 01:22:36.470 align:start position:0%
 
[Laughter]

01:22:36.470 --> 01:22:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:38.270 --> 01:22:38.280 align:start position:0%
um so yeah we'll talk about that a
 
01:22:40.189 --> 01:22:40.199 align:start position:0%
little bit it seems a little odd to tell
 
01:22:42.470 --> 01:22:42.480 align:start position:0%
you guys what's going on with SB 263
 
01:22:43.790 --> 01:22:43.800 align:start position:0%
because I did watch it yesterday I'm
 
01:22:45.530 --> 01:22:45.540 align:start position:0%
very very well aware
 
01:22:47.830 --> 01:22:47.840 align:start position:0%
um but
 
01:22:50.390 --> 01:22:50.400 align:start position:0%
so without further Ado I'll pass it over
 
01:22:54.530 --> 01:22:54.540 align:start position:0%
to Dr Finney and director me
 
01:22:57.050 --> 01:22:57.060 align:start position:0%
good afternoon chair and committee
 
01:23:00.130 --> 01:23:00.140 align:start position:0%
members it's nice to see you again
 
01:23:02.810 --> 01:23:02.820 align:start position:0%
we've had a lot of exciting things going
 
01:23:06.070 --> 01:23:06.080 align:start position:0%
on with the dental benefit
 
01:23:11.149 --> 01:23:11.159 align:start position:0%
as far as our Network goes we've seen a
 
01:23:13.910 --> 01:23:13.920 align:start position:0%
slow steady progression of an increase
 
01:23:18.010 --> 01:23:18.020 align:start position:0%
in providers in the network
 
01:23:22.850 --> 01:23:22.860 align:start position:0%
as of the the dashboard from May 10th we
 
01:23:27.350 --> 01:23:27.360 align:start position:0%
are up to 117 providers at this point
 
01:23:32.030 --> 01:23:32.040 align:start position:0%
one of our priorities is to improve
 
01:23:35.149 --> 01:23:35.159 align:start position:0%
access for geographic regions that have
 
01:23:39.410 --> 01:23:39.420 align:start position:0%
limited provider Supply and doing this
 
01:23:43.010 --> 01:23:43.020 align:start position:0%
through the use of mobile dental clinics
 
01:23:45.890 --> 01:23:45.900 align:start position:0%
that is one of the key strategy for
 
01:23:48.350 --> 01:23:48.360 align:start position:0%
supporting access in the identified
 
01:23:48.360 --> 01:23:50.330 align:start position:0%
supporting access in the identified
regions

01:23:50.330 --> 01:23:50.340 align:start position:0%
regions
 
01:23:53.590 --> 01:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
these clinics uh have been
 
01:23:58.070 --> 01:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
ongoing since April 1st there have been
 
01:24:00.470 --> 01:24:00.480 align:start position:0%
second visits to both Colebrook and
 
01:24:03.649 --> 01:24:03.659 align:start position:0%
Concord that were very successful not
 
01:24:06.530 --> 01:24:06.540 align:start position:0%
only did they have uh reappointments
 
01:24:08.810 --> 01:24:08.820 align:start position:0%
with folks that were seen on April 1st
 
01:24:11.390 --> 01:24:11.400 align:start position:0%
but they also were able to see some
 
01:24:15.130 --> 01:24:15.140 align:start position:0%
additional members on the second visits
 
01:24:19.430 --> 01:24:19.440 align:start position:0%
and basically the way that we're looking
 
01:24:22.790 --> 01:24:22.800 align:start position:0%
at moving forward is watching our
 
01:24:26.209 --> 01:24:26.219 align:start position:0%
Network adequacy across the state and
 
01:24:28.130 --> 01:24:28.140 align:start position:0%
making decisions about where those
 
01:24:31.130 --> 01:24:31.140 align:start position:0%
mobile events will happen based on where
 
01:24:34.189 --> 01:24:34.199 align:start position:0%
we have areas that have true need and
 
01:24:36.830 --> 01:24:36.840 align:start position:0%
we're having more difficulty providing
 
01:24:40.070 --> 01:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
access with providers in that area just
 
01:24:43.610 --> 01:24:43.620 align:start position:0%
because there aren't any
 
01:24:47.149 --> 01:24:47.159 align:start position:0%
um in terms of contract management yes
 
01:24:49.610 --> 01:24:49.620 align:start position:0%
Excuse me yes representative Weber could
 
01:24:51.290 --> 01:24:51.300 align:start position:0%
you be a little more specific about
 
01:24:53.450 --> 01:24:53.460 align:start position:0%
specifically where those areas are
 
01:24:53.460 --> 01:24:54.890 align:start position:0%
specifically where those areas are
because

01:24:54.890 --> 01:24:54.900 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:24:56.689 --> 01:24:56.699 align:start position:0%
um if I'm hearing that a mobile clinic
 
01:24:58.970 --> 01:24:58.980 align:start position:0%
is going to Concord
 
01:25:01.970 --> 01:25:01.980 align:start position:0%
um I'm I don't think of it as being a
 
01:25:03.950 --> 01:25:03.960 align:start position:0%
particularly rural or underserved area
 
01:25:05.990 --> 01:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
and I know we got into this last time
 
01:25:07.970 --> 01:25:07.980 align:start position:0%
about whether Washington was an urban
 
01:25:10.669 --> 01:25:10.679 align:start position:0%
area or not but I just want to know
 
01:25:13.250 --> 01:25:13.260 align:start position:0%
where it is that you're looking at at
 
01:25:15.669 --> 01:25:15.679 align:start position:0%
needing to fill in services so we know
 
01:25:19.010 --> 01:25:19.020 align:start position:0%
it's actually a combination of the
 
01:25:20.870 --> 01:25:20.880 align:start position:0%
number of providers and the number of
 
01:25:23.149 --> 01:25:23.159 align:start position:0%
members that are residing in a certain
 
01:25:26.930 --> 01:25:26.940 align:start position:0%
area there's also certain
 
01:25:26.940 --> 01:25:27.910 align:start position:0%
area there's also certain
um

01:25:27.910 --> 01:25:27.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:30.830 --> 01:25:30.840 align:start position:0%
locations that lend themselves to doing
 
01:25:35.570 --> 01:25:35.580 align:start position:0%
a mobile service so conquered is a
 
01:25:38.450 --> 01:25:38.460 align:start position:0%
central location and the facility that
 
01:25:41.209 --> 01:25:41.219 align:start position:0%
we had available allowed us to not only
 
01:25:45.290 --> 01:25:45.300 align:start position:0%
have the mobile van itself but an area
 
01:25:48.410 --> 01:25:48.420 align:start position:0%
to greet the members determine
 
01:25:52.070 --> 01:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
eligibility and then move them on to
 
01:25:52.080 --> 01:25:52.990 align:start position:0%
eligibility and then move them on to
services

01:25:52.990 --> 01:25:53.000 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:25:56.830 --> 01:25:56.840 align:start position:0%
so it's it's not one single
 
01:25:59.570 --> 01:25:59.580 align:start position:0%
criteria that we have for making that
 
01:26:01.850 --> 01:26:01.860 align:start position:0%
decision it's it's there's many
 
01:26:01.860 --> 01:26:03.050 align:start position:0%
decision it's it's there's many
different

01:26:03.050 --> 01:26:03.060 align:start position:0%
different
 
01:26:05.750 --> 01:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
um different pieces that go into the
 
01:26:08.090 --> 01:26:08.100 align:start position:0%
decision of where the clinics go so so
 
01:26:10.070 --> 01:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
am I understanding that part of what the
 
01:26:11.750 --> 01:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
mobile centers are doing is signing up
 
01:26:13.610 --> 01:26:13.620 align:start position:0%
people not just providing Direct
 
01:26:15.950 --> 01:26:15.960 align:start position:0%
Services it's correct they're signing up
 
01:26:17.990 --> 01:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
members it's that you know eligibility
 
01:26:20.270 --> 01:26:20.280 align:start position:0%
has to be confirmed the day of the
 
01:26:23.390 --> 01:26:23.400 align:start position:0%
appointment and so you need to have an
 
01:26:25.910 --> 01:26:25.920 align:start position:0%
area where that can be done with privacy
 
01:26:25.920 --> 01:26:27.470 align:start position:0%
area where that can be done with privacy
and

01:26:27.470 --> 01:26:27.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:26:29.570 --> 01:26:29.580 align:start position:0%
um so you know there's there's a
 
01:26:32.510 --> 01:26:32.520 align:start position:0%
facility piece of this beside just the
 
01:26:35.570 --> 01:26:35.580 align:start position:0%
Mobile land itself okay thank you one
 
01:26:37.310 --> 01:26:37.320 align:start position:0%
would think that a rural area would have
 
01:26:39.470 --> 01:26:39.480 align:start position:0%
a lot of privacy
 
01:26:43.729 --> 01:26:43.739 align:start position:0%
Mr representative Edwards so my my
 
01:26:45.950 --> 01:26:45.960 align:start position:0%
commenter question is is really very
 
01:26:47.990 --> 01:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
related to what representative Webber
 
01:26:51.530 --> 01:26:51.540 align:start position:0%
just said and that is that that my issue
 
01:26:54.350 --> 01:26:54.360 align:start position:0%
has has been that
 
01:26:57.410 --> 01:26:57.420 align:start position:0%
um uh in division three we had these
 
01:27:00.649 --> 01:27:00.659 align:start position:0%
nice New Hampshire maps presented to us
 
01:27:04.189 --> 01:27:04.199 align:start position:0%
with the demographics of of the state
 
01:27:07.490 --> 01:27:07.500 align:start position:0%
and that there were like five Hot
 
01:27:12.290 --> 01:27:12.300 align:start position:0%
Pockets of of um where we had
 
01:27:12.300 --> 01:27:13.030 align:start position:0%
Pockets of of um where we had
um

01:27:13.030 --> 01:27:13.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:16.010 --> 01:27:16.020 align:start position:0%
disproportionate diversity issues and
 
01:27:19.669 --> 01:27:19.679 align:start position:0%
five particular areas and so I am just
 
01:27:22.790 --> 01:27:22.800 align:start position:0%
trying to map what you all tell me
 
01:27:25.850 --> 01:27:25.860 align:start position:0%
you're doing with what the effect on the
 
01:27:28.070 --> 01:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
ground is I want to know that we are
 
01:27:31.070 --> 01:27:31.080 align:start position:0%
proactively monitoring these
 
01:27:32.689 --> 01:27:32.699 align:start position:0%
traditionally underserved communities
 
01:27:36.590 --> 01:27:36.600 align:start position:0%
and that were explicitly trying to uh
 
01:27:38.930 --> 01:27:38.940 align:start position:0%
resolve those
 
01:27:42.590 --> 01:27:42.600 align:start position:0%
so um we are working on developing maps
 
01:27:44.770 --> 01:27:44.780 align:start position:0%
to visualize exactly what you describe
 
01:27:47.510 --> 01:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
what the access looks like in every
 
01:27:50.209 --> 01:27:50.219 align:start position:0%
region of the state we do have that
 
01:27:52.129 --> 01:27:52.139 align:start position:0%
information from Northeast Delta Dental
 
01:27:54.169 --> 01:27:54.179 align:start position:0%
and DentaQuest but it's just not at this
 
01:27:55.910 --> 01:27:55.920 align:start position:0%
time in a format we felt was ready to
 
01:27:58.189 --> 01:27:58.199 align:start position:0%
present to this audience but we
 
01:27:59.750 --> 01:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
anticipate having that in future
 
01:28:03.050 --> 01:28:03.060 align:start position:0%
meetings so so representative Weber hit
 
01:28:05.689 --> 01:28:05.699 align:start position:0%
me upside the head with a common sense
 
01:28:07.729 --> 01:28:07.739 align:start position:0%
stick last time and she said we don't
 
01:28:11.629 --> 01:28:11.639 align:start position:0%
necessarily need a a heat map like what
 
01:28:14.930 --> 01:28:14.940 align:start position:0%
I want we could just take a a list of
 
01:28:17.510 --> 01:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
zip codes in an Excel file or something
 
01:28:20.030 --> 01:28:20.040 align:start position:0%
so that we could at least begin to
 
01:28:22.669 --> 01:28:22.679 align:start position:0%
communicate with our colleagues that may
 
01:28:24.290 --> 01:28:24.300 align:start position:0%
be interested in whether or not their
 
01:28:26.990 --> 01:28:27.000 align:start position:0%
communities being served so so maybe as
 
01:28:29.209 --> 01:28:29.219 align:start position:0%
a first step prior to this glorious heat
 
01:28:31.310 --> 01:28:31.320 align:start position:0%
map thing that I want that we could do
 
01:28:34.970 --> 01:28:34.980 align:start position:0%
an interim basic data swap we could
 
01:28:36.950 --> 01:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
absolutely do that and I'll say too that
 
01:28:40.250 --> 01:28:40.260 align:start position:0%
leading up to April 1st we had a really
 
01:28:43.189 --> 01:28:43.199 align:start position:0%
strong focus on certain aspects of
 
01:28:44.810 --> 01:28:44.820 align:start position:0%
network adequacy include including oral
 
01:28:47.810 --> 01:28:47.820 align:start position:0%
surgeons and we saw a lot of success on
 
01:28:51.050 --> 01:28:51.060 align:start position:0%
that service type growth there and now
 
01:28:52.669 --> 01:28:52.679 align:start position:0%
we are shifting to look more at
 
01:28:54.770 --> 01:28:54.780 align:start position:0%
Geographic areas of need not that we
 
01:28:56.030 --> 01:28:56.040 align:start position:0%
weren't looking at them before but
 
01:29:00.770 --> 01:29:00.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:03.350 --> 01:29:03.360 align:start position:0%
I I think the other thing that I would
 
01:29:05.510 --> 01:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
like to mention is that
 
01:29:05.520 --> 01:29:06.290 align:start position:0%
like to mention is that
um

01:29:06.290 --> 01:29:06.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:08.810 --> 01:29:08.820 align:start position:0%
yes there are definitely certain areas
 
01:29:11.149 --> 01:29:11.159 align:start position:0%
of the state that for a long period of
 
01:29:13.129 --> 01:29:13.139 align:start position:0%
time have been underserved and and we
 
01:29:15.770 --> 01:29:15.780 align:start position:0%
are aware of them we're also watching
 
01:29:19.430 --> 01:29:19.440 align:start position:0%
how the membership is changing now that
 
01:29:22.790 --> 01:29:22.800 align:start position:0%
we are past the phe and we're into what
 
01:29:25.910 --> 01:29:25.920 align:start position:0%
we refer to as the unwind so there are
 
01:29:27.890 --> 01:29:27.900 align:start position:0%
some changing demographics with our
 
01:29:30.649 --> 01:29:30.659 align:start position:0%
members at the same time that we're
 
01:29:33.950 --> 01:29:33.960 align:start position:0%
watching our provider Network grow so
 
01:29:35.810 --> 01:29:35.820 align:start position:0%
you know we're trying to make these
 
01:29:37.550 --> 01:29:37.560 align:start position:0%
decisions but also keeping those two
 
01:29:39.770 --> 01:29:39.780 align:start position:0%
things in mind as we're we're moving
 
01:29:42.669 --> 01:29:42.679 align:start position:0%
towards those decisions
 
01:29:45.530 --> 01:29:45.540 align:start position:0%
follow up let me just wrap that up
 
01:29:48.110 --> 01:29:48.120 align:start position:0%
that's great I suspect you're really
 
01:29:50.930 --> 01:29:50.940 align:start position:0%
doing the right thing I'm just asking
 
01:29:52.910 --> 01:29:52.920 align:start position:0%
for you to take us on the ride with you
 
01:29:55.790 --> 01:29:55.800 align:start position:0%
so that we can understand exactly what's
 
01:29:57.590 --> 01:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
going on and that we can communicate
 
01:30:00.169 --> 01:30:00.179 align:start position:0%
there are 400 of us in theory all around
 
01:30:02.450 --> 01:30:02.460 align:start position:0%
the state and it'd be great if we knew
 
01:30:04.850 --> 01:30:04.860 align:start position:0%
what was going on in our communities and
 
01:30:07.310 --> 01:30:07.320 align:start position:0%
so I I hope to share what you're doing
 
01:30:09.410 --> 01:30:09.420 align:start position:0%
with them as soon as we get the right
 
01:30:09.420 --> 01:30:10.669 align:start position:0%
with them as soon as we get the right
data

01:30:10.669 --> 01:30:10.679 align:start position:0%
data
 
01:30:12.770 --> 01:30:12.780 align:start position:0%
that would be terrific I would love to
 
01:30:15.729 --> 01:30:15.739 align:start position:0%
have 400 recruiters across the state
 
01:30:17.990 --> 01:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
representative King
 
01:30:20.090 --> 01:30:20.100 align:start position:0%
yeah so a lot of this sounded familiar
 
01:30:22.370 --> 01:30:22.380 align:start position:0%
from the last meeting and I'm not going
 
01:30:24.350 --> 01:30:24.360 align:start position:0%
to say this is why Mr Littman didn't
 
01:30:27.110 --> 01:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
show up today but he we gave him the
 
01:30:33.590 --> 01:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:33.600 --> 01:30:35.810 align:start position:0%
 
right

01:30:35.810 --> 01:30:35.820 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:30:37.910 --> 01:30:37.920 align:start position:0%
yeah you still got time
 
01:30:37.920 --> 01:30:40.610 align:start position:0%
yeah you still got time
[Music]

01:30:40.610 --> 01:30:40.620 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:30:43.370 --> 01:30:43.380 align:start position:0%
so we can follow up on that to get that
 
01:30:46.610 --> 01:30:46.620 align:start position:0%
to the committee Mr
 
01:30:46.620 --> 01:30:48.770 align:start position:0%
to the committee Mr
business

01:30:48.770 --> 01:30:48.780 align:start position:0%
business
 
01:30:48.780 --> 01:30:49.490 align:start position:0%
business
um

01:30:49.490 --> 01:30:49.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:52.510 --> 01:30:52.520 align:start position:0%
if they're if we're uh
 
01:30:57.110 --> 01:30:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:00.490 --> 01:31:00.500 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry yeah I know what all right
 
01:31:03.410 --> 01:31:03.420 align:start position:0%
he is one of my two favorite pharmacists
 
01:31:05.090 --> 01:31:05.100 align:start position:0%
in the House of Representatives so I
 
01:31:07.250 --> 01:31:07.260 align:start position:0%
cannot ignore him representative thank
 
01:31:09.950 --> 01:31:09.960 align:start position:0%
you Mr representative Merchant one of
 
01:31:09.960 --> 01:31:12.530 align:start position:0%
you Mr representative Merchant one of
these

01:31:12.530 --> 01:31:12.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:14.270 --> 01:31:14.280 align:start position:0%
would you
 
01:31:16.250 --> 01:31:16.260 align:start position:0%
um somewhere along the way to help me
 
01:31:17.390 --> 01:31:17.400 align:start position:0%
understand maybe the rest of the
 
01:31:19.490 --> 01:31:19.500 align:start position:0%
committee as well as we go through the
 
01:31:22.490 --> 01:31:22.500 align:start position:0%
Medicaid recertification how this is
 
01:31:24.410 --> 01:31:24.420 align:start position:0%
going to impact this program
 
01:31:25.610 --> 01:31:25.620 align:start position:0%
um we're really concerned about is
 
01:31:27.290 --> 01:31:27.300 align:start position:0%
children because what's
 
01:31:30.410 --> 01:31:30.420 align:start position:0%
as adults as well as children but if
 
01:31:32.870 --> 01:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
we're going through recertification
 
01:31:35.090 --> 01:31:35.100 align:start position:0%
is it going to have a bigger impact on
 
01:31:36.410 --> 01:31:36.420 align:start position:0%
the dental program versus the medical
 
01:31:37.870 --> 01:31:37.880 align:start position:0%
program or are they basically
 
01:31:39.950 --> 01:31:39.960 align:start position:0%
independent of each other therefore what
 
01:31:41.090 --> 01:31:41.100 align:start position:0%
happens on the medical side really
 
01:31:43.490 --> 01:31:43.500 align:start position:0%
doesn't impact the dental side and the
 
01:31:45.649 --> 01:31:45.659 align:start position:0%
other way around
 
01:31:47.149 --> 01:31:47.159 align:start position:0%
um all right there's there's two parts
 
01:31:48.770 --> 01:31:48.780 align:start position:0%
to my answer
 
01:31:51.229 --> 01:31:51.239 align:start position:0%
um the children's benefit remains
 
01:31:54.350 --> 01:31:54.360 align:start position:0%
unchanged and is as it has been in the
 
01:31:54.360 --> 01:31:55.250 align:start position:0%
unchanged and is as it has been in the
past

01:31:55.250 --> 01:31:55.260 align:start position:0%
past
 
01:31:55.260 --> 01:31:56.390 align:start position:0%
past
um

01:31:56.390 --> 01:31:56.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:59.330 --> 01:31:59.340 align:start position:0%
the same I I think the same impact would
 
01:32:01.430 --> 01:32:01.440 align:start position:0%
be felt for both medical and dental
 
01:32:01.440 --> 01:32:02.870 align:start position:0%
be felt for both medical and dental
because

01:32:02.870 --> 01:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:32:05.450 --> 01:32:05.460 align:start position:0%
you have to be fully Medicaid eligible
 
01:32:08.629 --> 01:32:08.639 align:start position:0%
to have either or both so it would move
 
01:32:11.030 --> 01:32:11.040 align:start position:0%
along the same way
 
01:32:13.729 --> 01:32:13.739 align:start position:0%
so do we have some initial data I think
 
01:32:15.290 --> 01:32:15.300 align:start position:0%
when Miss lippen was here before talking
 
01:32:16.810 --> 01:32:16.820 align:start position:0%
about the number of people covered by
 
01:32:20.330 --> 01:32:20.340 align:start position:0%
Medicaid that possibly could be coming
 
01:32:22.250 --> 01:32:22.260 align:start position:0%
off the rolls because of recertification
 
01:32:24.770 --> 01:32:24.780 align:start position:0%
are we having any kind of information on
 
01:32:26.450 --> 01:32:26.460 align:start position:0%
the dental side as well as the medical
 
01:32:26.460 --> 01:32:27.410 align:start position:0%
the dental side as well as the medical
side

01:32:27.410 --> 01:32:27.420 align:start position:0%
side
 
01:32:27.420 --> 01:32:29.510 align:start position:0%
side
comparable

01:32:29.510 --> 01:32:29.520 align:start position:0%
comparable
 
01:32:32.330 --> 01:32:32.340 align:start position:0%
so we can are you asking for updates on
 
01:32:34.790 --> 01:32:34.800 align:start position:0%
the results of the unwind so folks who
 
01:32:36.649 --> 01:32:36.659 align:start position:0%
are being redetermined for their
 
01:32:38.090 --> 01:32:38.100 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Eligibility and what impact
 
01:32:40.010 --> 01:32:40.020 align:start position:0%
that has on enrollment yes you said it
 
01:32:42.950 --> 01:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
very well thank you do we want to share
 
01:32:44.870 --> 01:32:44.880 align:start position:0%
updates on that I mean we can speak to
 
01:32:46.729 --> 01:32:46.739 align:start position:0%
it at a high level that's starting in
 
01:32:50.629 --> 01:32:50.639 align:start position:0%
April or go ahead Rob so I'm prepared to
 
01:32:52.189 --> 01:32:52.199 align:start position:0%
provide the grid and Advantage numbers
 
01:32:54.229 --> 01:32:54.239 align:start position:0%
we do have
 
01:32:56.209 --> 01:32:56.219 align:start position:0%
um access to the other numbers that we
 
01:32:58.669 --> 01:32:58.679 align:start position:0%
can absolutely provide after this uh
 
01:33:00.830 --> 01:33:00.840 align:start position:0%
this meeting but for granted advantage
 
01:33:03.830 --> 01:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
since the unwind began or a continuous
 
01:33:07.610 --> 01:33:07.620 align:start position:0%
coverage ended back in on April 1st uh
 
01:33:13.729 --> 01:33:13.739 align:start position:0%
as of uh 5 15 23 so a few days ago the
 
01:33:17.030 --> 01:33:17.040 align:start position:0%
grand Advantage enrollment was 75 178
 
01:33:20.450 --> 01:33:20.460 align:start position:0%
individuals and that's a net decrease of
 
01:33:24.770 --> 01:33:24.780 align:start position:0%
21 337 since the continuous coverage
 
01:33:28.010 --> 01:33:28.020 align:start position:0%
period ended on April 1st that's for
 
01:33:29.330 --> 01:33:29.340 align:start position:0%
granted Advantage we do have numbers for
 
01:33:30.350 --> 01:33:30.360 align:start position:0%
the others but I don't have those
 
01:33:31.910 --> 01:33:31.920 align:start position:0%
available at the moment but we can get
 
01:33:34.729 --> 01:33:34.739 align:start position:0%
them pretty easy thank you thank you and
 
01:33:36.770 --> 01:33:36.780 align:start position:0%
just in case it's not totally clear so
 
01:33:38.810 --> 01:33:38.820 align:start position:0%
if someone loses Medicaid Eligibility
 
01:33:40.910 --> 01:33:40.920 align:start position:0%
you know they have their medical I like
 
01:33:42.290 --> 01:33:42.300 align:start position:0%
to think of the ID cards they have a
 
01:33:43.970 --> 01:33:43.980 align:start position:0%
medical ID card they have their Dental
 
01:33:46.189 --> 01:33:46.199 align:start position:0%
benefit ID card if you don't have
 
01:33:47.930 --> 01:33:47.940 align:start position:0%
Medicaid anymore you don't have either
 
01:33:49.970 --> 01:33:49.980 align:start position:0%
of those benefits anymore so it would
 
01:33:52.790 --> 01:33:52.800 align:start position:0%
impact them kind of equally in that way
 
01:33:55.010 --> 01:33:55.020 align:start position:0%
and part of the concern
 
01:33:58.550 --> 01:33:58.560 align:start position:0%
with the adults is that when you have a
 
01:33:58.560 --> 01:33:59.810 align:start position:0%
with the adults is that when you have a
dental

01:33:59.810 --> 01:33:59.820 align:start position:0%
dental
 
01:34:01.729 --> 01:34:01.739 align:start position:0%
issue a lot of times it's multiple
 
01:34:03.890 --> 01:34:03.900 align:start position:0%
procedures that are being done so what
 
01:34:05.530 --> 01:34:05.540 align:start position:0%
I'm a concern is that we have
 
01:34:08.450 --> 01:34:08.460 align:start position:0%
individuals to start in the program that
 
01:34:10.610 --> 01:34:10.620 align:start position:0%
become disqualified
 
01:34:13.729 --> 01:34:13.739 align:start position:0%
for the reasons for unwinding if you
 
01:34:15.410 --> 01:34:15.420 align:start position:0%
will and then all of a sudden they lose
 
01:34:17.390 --> 01:34:17.400 align:start position:0%
the benefit and I'm trying to figure out
 
01:34:19.189 --> 01:34:19.199 align:start position:0%
this point in time do we have any people
 
01:34:20.870 --> 01:34:20.880 align:start position:0%
out there that may fall into that Gap
 
01:34:22.430 --> 01:34:22.440 align:start position:0%
where all of a sudden they have it one
 
01:34:23.629 --> 01:34:23.639 align:start position:0%
day but they're not going to have the
 
01:34:26.330 --> 01:34:26.340 align:start position:0%
next day absolutely yeah I think that is
 
01:34:28.010 --> 01:34:28.020 align:start position:0%
something we also talk about with
 
01:34:29.750 --> 01:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
Northeast Delta Dental and Dental Quest
 
01:34:32.510 --> 01:34:32.520 align:start position:0%
are three medical mcos are a bit more
 
01:34:34.910 --> 01:34:34.920 align:start position:0%
mature at this point in dealing with the
 
01:34:36.770 --> 01:34:36.780 align:start position:0%
unwind and supporting their members but
 
01:34:38.450 --> 01:34:38.460 align:start position:0%
that's something we definitely want to
 
01:34:40.850 --> 01:34:40.860 align:start position:0%
see from the the dental vendor as well
 
01:34:43.729 --> 01:34:43.739 align:start position:0%
to prevent avoidable disruption in
 
01:34:46.310 --> 01:34:46.320 align:start position:0%
service as you mentioned
 
01:34:49.550 --> 01:34:49.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:51.910 --> 01:34:51.920 align:start position:0%
um let's move on to contract management
 
01:34:56.030 --> 01:34:56.040 align:start position:0%
uh well CMS did approve the contract
 
01:34:59.870 --> 01:34:59.880 align:start position:0%
they had asked for us to do an amendment
 
01:35:02.570 --> 01:35:02.580 align:start position:0%
which will occur this fall and merely
 
01:35:05.090 --> 01:35:05.100 align:start position:0%
what they asked for in that amendment is
 
01:35:07.729 --> 01:35:07.739 align:start position:0%
to clean up a lot of language to make
 
01:35:10.310 --> 01:35:10.320 align:start position:0%
sure that our language matches with the
 
01:35:12.070 --> 01:35:12.080 align:start position:0%
current Managed Care
 
01:35:15.229 --> 01:35:15.239 align:start position:0%
requirements that CMS has there was
 
01:35:18.290 --> 01:35:18.300 align:start position:0%
nothing operational about the contract
 
01:35:20.209 --> 01:35:20.219 align:start position:0%
that was an issue so it really would be
 
01:35:22.550 --> 01:35:22.560 align:start position:0%
looked at as cleanup
 
01:35:25.550 --> 01:35:25.560 align:start position:0%
and so we will embark on that in the
 
01:35:25.560 --> 01:35:27.010 align:start position:0%
and so we will embark on that in the
fall

01:35:27.010 --> 01:35:27.020 align:start position:0%
fall
 
01:35:30.890 --> 01:35:30.900 align:start position:0%
in terms of implementation ID cards and
 
01:35:33.590 --> 01:35:33.600 align:start position:0%
member materials have been distributed
 
01:35:33.600 --> 01:35:36.229 align:start position:0%
member materials have been distributed
distributed

01:35:36.229 --> 01:35:36.239 align:start position:0%
distributed
 
01:35:38.410 --> 01:35:38.420 align:start position:0%
um in the initial weeks of the program
 
01:35:41.510 --> 01:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
operations have run smoothly we've had
 
01:35:44.510 --> 01:35:44.520 align:start position:0%
some small blips which anyone might you
 
01:35:47.209 --> 01:35:47.219 align:start position:0%
know expect with a program this large
 
01:35:49.550 --> 01:35:49.560 align:start position:0%
going up as quickly as it did but
 
01:35:52.790 --> 01:35:52.800 align:start position:0%
everything has been dealt with by
 
01:35:55.850 --> 01:35:55.860 align:start position:0%
Northeast Delta and DentaQuest in a
 
01:35:58.850 --> 01:35:58.860 align:start position:0%
quick and efficient manner to make sure
 
01:36:02.709 --> 01:36:02.719 align:start position:0%
that operations continue the department
 
01:36:06.649 --> 01:36:06.659 align:start position:0%
weeks meets multiple times each week
 
01:36:09.530 --> 01:36:09.540 align:start position:0%
with Northeast Delta and DentaQuest and
 
01:36:13.010 --> 01:36:13.020 align:start position:0%
we address things as they come up and I
 
01:36:15.530 --> 01:36:15.540 align:start position:0%
see that those meetings will probably go
 
01:36:17.990 --> 01:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
on for the the near future because we
 
01:36:20.689 --> 01:36:20.699 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that we stay on top of
 
01:36:22.490 --> 01:36:22.500 align:start position:0%
the processes and make sure that
 
01:36:27.770 --> 01:36:27.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:29.149 --> 01:36:29.159 align:start position:0%
um and then you know we've already
 
01:36:32.390 --> 01:36:32.400 align:start position:0%
discussed heat maps versus Excel
 
01:36:34.370 --> 01:36:34.380 align:start position:0%
spreadsheets and we will absolutely
 
01:36:37.610 --> 01:36:37.620 align:start position:0%
Continue to update you and you know take
 
01:36:41.149 --> 01:36:41.159 align:start position:0%
your feedback on what best serves your
 
01:36:44.030 --> 01:36:44.040 align:start position:0%
needs to understand our networking
 
01:36:46.430 --> 01:36:46.440 align:start position:0%
I'd like to know a little bit about how
 
01:36:49.370 --> 01:36:49.380 align:start position:0%
big Northeast Delta dentist is compared
 
01:36:52.250 --> 01:36:52.260 align:start position:0%
to DentaQuest in terms of your providers
 
01:36:57.229 --> 01:36:57.239 align:start position:0%
I think 117 you said right now right I I
 
01:36:59.270 --> 01:36:59.280 align:start position:0%
um I don't I'm not sure I understand
 
01:37:01.370 --> 01:37:01.380 align:start position:0%
your question
 
01:37:05.810 --> 01:37:05.820 align:start position:0%
well you I mean I think dentistry in New
 
01:37:07.790 --> 01:37:07.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I think Northeast Delta
 
01:37:09.169 --> 01:37:09.179 align:start position:0%
because that's what I know and they gave
 
01:37:10.850 --> 01:37:10.860 align:start position:0%
me a free meal
 
01:37:13.129 --> 01:37:13.139 align:start position:0%
um and I I don't know DentaQuest they're
 
01:37:14.689 --> 01:37:14.699 align:start position:0%
probably good and I'm sure I'll go out
 
01:37:16.729 --> 01:37:16.739 align:start position:0%
if they invite me but
 
01:37:21.709 --> 01:37:21.719 align:start position:0%
um those two groups do what okay now I I
 
01:37:23.990 --> 01:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
understand okay I do too I was getting
 
01:37:26.149 --> 01:37:26.159 align:start position:0%
there okay
 
01:37:29.270 --> 01:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
um Northeast Delta Dental really has the
 
01:37:31.070 --> 01:37:31.080 align:start position:0%
Deep knowledge of the New Hampshire
 
01:37:34.790 --> 01:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
dentist Network and in their commercial
 
01:37:38.090 --> 01:37:38.100 align:start position:0%
plans they are represented
 
01:37:41.810 --> 01:37:41.820 align:start position:0%
um extremely well I believe their uh one
 
01:37:43.729 --> 01:37:43.739 align:start position:0%
of their commercial plans they have
 
01:37:46.129 --> 01:37:46.139 align:start position:0%
upwards of 85 percent of New Hampshire
 
01:37:49.330 --> 01:37:49.340 align:start position:0%
dentists enrolled in their PPO program
 
01:37:52.129 --> 01:37:52.139 align:start position:0%
less I think they're somewhere around 50
 
01:37:54.890 --> 01:37:54.900 align:start position:0%
percent so the reason that Delta was
 
01:37:57.470 --> 01:37:57.480 align:start position:0%
interested in this contract is because
 
01:38:01.010 --> 01:38:01.020 align:start position:0%
of their knowledge of dentists in the
 
01:38:01.020 --> 01:38:02.149 align:start position:0%
of their knowledge of dentists in the
state

01:38:02.149 --> 01:38:02.159 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:38:04.370 --> 01:38:04.380 align:start position:0%
the reason they subcontracted with
 
01:38:07.129 --> 01:38:07.139 align:start position:0%
DentaQuest is that DentaQuest runs
 
01:38:09.470 --> 01:38:09.480 align:start position:0%
Dental Medicaid programs in
 
01:38:11.689 --> 01:38:11.699 align:start position:0%
approximately 30 States across the
 
01:38:15.310 --> 01:38:15.320 align:start position:0%
country they are the largest Medicaid
 
01:38:18.410 --> 01:38:18.420 align:start position:0%
administrator in dentistry out there
 
01:38:22.010 --> 01:38:22.020 align:start position:0%
right now and so Delta felt that the
 
01:38:25.129 --> 01:38:25.139 align:start position:0%
combination of the Delta experience to
 
01:38:28.070 --> 01:38:28.080 align:start position:0%
date in state added together with
 
01:38:30.709 --> 01:38:30.719 align:start position:0%
deniquest experience running Medicaid
 
01:38:34.490 --> 01:38:34.500 align:start position:0%
programs made for a good partnership
 
01:38:37.729 --> 01:38:37.739 align:start position:0%
so it's collaborative yes I could not
 
01:38:42.229 --> 01:38:42.239 align:start position:0%
see the leader of Delta Dental being a
 
01:38:45.890 --> 01:38:45.900 align:start position:0%
Ruffian and and what Olivia just pointed
 
01:38:49.129 --> 01:38:49.139 align:start position:0%
out it's one network it's not like these
 
01:38:51.830 --> 01:38:51.840 align:start position:0%
two entities each have their it is one
 
01:38:53.510 --> 01:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
single one work
 
01:38:58.729 --> 01:38:58.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:00.470 --> 01:39:00.480 align:start position:0%
representative this is one of my
 
01:39:02.390 --> 01:39:02.400 align:start position:0%
favorite topics on a roll one of my
 
01:39:04.729 --> 01:39:04.739 align:start position:0%
favorite dentists uh probably because
 
01:39:08.270 --> 01:39:08.280 align:start position:0%
you've never drilled me so hey
 
01:39:08.280 --> 01:39:10.250 align:start position:0%
you've never drilled me so hey
um

01:39:10.250 --> 01:39:10.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:12.830 --> 01:39:12.840 align:start position:0%
um I think you meant to imply it but I
 
01:39:14.689 --> 01:39:14.699 align:start position:0%
just need to hear it in this contract
 
01:39:17.090 --> 01:39:17.100 align:start position:0%
rewrite it's none of that's affecting
 
01:39:19.850 --> 01:39:19.860 align:start position:0%
our waivers our waivers are secure no
 
01:39:22.910 --> 01:39:22.920 align:start position:0%
the policy is secure policy is secure
 
01:39:26.209 --> 01:39:26.219 align:start position:0%
waivers are secure This truly is little
 
01:39:29.270 --> 01:39:29.280 align:start position:0%
tweaks of life I just had to hear it all
 
01:39:31.370 --> 01:39:31.380 align:start position:0%
right and then the second thing are we
 
01:39:34.370 --> 01:39:34.380 align:start position:0%
starting to get any data on the number
 
01:39:36.830 --> 01:39:36.840 align:start position:0%
of no-show appointments because that was
 
01:39:39.770 --> 01:39:39.780 align:start position:0%
a concern with this population and and
 
01:39:42.110 --> 01:39:42.120 align:start position:0%
there was some brainstorming that was to
 
01:39:43.910 --> 01:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
take place that probably did take place
 
01:39:47.270 --> 01:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
on how to mitigate the the no-shows
 
01:39:50.510 --> 01:39:50.520 align:start position:0%
under the perception that this is a
 
01:39:52.610 --> 01:39:52.620 align:start position:0%
community that no shows more frequently
 
01:39:55.189 --> 01:39:55.199 align:start position:0%
than other communities and so what can
 
01:39:58.010 --> 01:39:58.020 align:start position:0%
you tell us about no shows and what
 
01:40:00.950 --> 01:40:00.960 align:start position:0%
we're doing and is it a problem and you
 
01:40:03.590 --> 01:40:03.600 align:start position:0%
know the like okay the the process that
 
01:40:07.129 --> 01:40:07.139 align:start position:0%
is in place is that um through the
 
01:40:10.250 --> 01:40:10.260 align:start position:0%
claims adjudication
 
01:40:12.649 --> 01:40:12.659 align:start position:0%
um missed appointments and late
 
01:40:15.770 --> 01:40:15.780 align:start position:0%
cancellations are go go through that
 
01:40:19.070 --> 01:40:19.080 align:start position:0%
adjudication and then a flag goes out to
 
01:40:23.149 --> 01:40:23.159 align:start position:0%
care management team and calls are
 
01:40:25.970 --> 01:40:25.980 align:start position:0%
actually placed to those members to say
 
01:40:27.890 --> 01:40:27.900 align:start position:0%
we noticed that you missed an
 
01:40:29.810 --> 01:40:29.820 align:start position:0%
appointment we need to talk to you so
 
01:40:32.030 --> 01:40:32.040 align:start position:0%
that we can work out you know why you
 
01:40:34.070 --> 01:40:34.080 align:start position:0%
weren't there
 
01:40:36.470 --> 01:40:36.480 align:start position:0%
um so there is a whole process for that
 
01:40:38.209 --> 01:40:38.219 align:start position:0%
that is in place
 
01:40:43.669 --> 01:40:43.679 align:start position:0%
we're only at May 19th so I really don't
 
01:40:45.950 --> 01:40:45.960 align:start position:0%
have any
 
01:40:48.410 --> 01:40:48.420 align:start position:0%
um data that I can share or I've even
 
01:40:51.169 --> 01:40:51.179 align:start position:0%
had the opportunity to look at to see
 
01:40:55.430 --> 01:40:55.440 align:start position:0%
what the rates of no-shows and and late
 
01:40:57.830 --> 01:40:57.840 align:start position:0%
cancellations is but that is definitely
 
01:41:00.410 --> 01:41:00.420 align:start position:0%
something that we're watching
 
01:41:03.790 --> 01:41:03.800 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant thank you Mr
 
01:41:05.990 --> 01:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
that's definitely something I'd like to
 
01:41:08.870 --> 01:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
keep our eye on because on the provider
 
01:41:10.189 --> 01:41:10.199 align:start position:0%
side if
 
01:41:12.590 --> 01:41:12.600 align:start position:0%
they don't have a patient in the chair
 
01:41:15.290 --> 01:41:15.300 align:start position:0%
there's no revenue for that time and my
 
01:41:16.790 --> 01:41:16.800 align:start position:0%
concern is if this back to
 
01:41:20.450 --> 01:41:20.460 align:start position:0%
representative Edward's comment this
 
01:41:22.550 --> 01:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
community has probably hired no-show
 
01:41:25.189 --> 01:41:25.199 align:start position:0%
rate than the normal community and I'm
 
01:41:26.689 --> 01:41:26.699 align:start position:0%
really concerned about the dental
 
01:41:29.330 --> 01:41:29.340 align:start position:0%
providers out there if they're having a
 
01:41:31.729 --> 01:41:31.739 align:start position:0%
high incident of no shows what that
 
01:41:33.890 --> 01:41:33.900 align:start position:0%
means to them on their bottom line given
 
01:41:35.510 --> 01:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
the fact that most likely the
 
01:41:38.330 --> 01:41:38.340 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rates for Medicaid are
 
01:41:40.850 --> 01:41:40.860 align:start position:0%
less than what they come from Delta
 
01:41:43.370 --> 01:41:43.380 align:start position:0%
Dental from commercial side right so I'm
 
01:41:45.169 --> 01:41:45.179 align:start position:0%
really concerned about this issue of no
 
01:41:47.149 --> 01:41:47.159 align:start position:0%
show and what that will mean because if
 
01:41:48.709 --> 01:41:48.719 align:start position:0%
we don't find a way either to backfill
 
01:41:50.930 --> 01:41:50.940 align:start position:0%
it financially or work with the
 
01:41:52.910 --> 01:41:52.920 align:start position:0%
providers to minimize that I think we
 
01:41:54.530 --> 01:41:54.540 align:start position:0%
could have providers pulling out of the
 
01:41:57.350 --> 01:41:57.360 align:start position:0%
service and the secretly concern
 
01:41:59.270 --> 01:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
um what I would like to add is that we
 
01:42:02.390 --> 01:42:02.400 align:start position:0%
also have a transportation piece of this
 
01:42:04.669 --> 01:42:04.679 align:start position:0%
contract where
 
01:42:07.970 --> 01:42:07.980 align:start position:0%
um if members uh through the the risk
 
01:42:10.550 --> 01:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
assessment that happens you know as they
 
01:42:10.560 --> 01:42:11.450 align:start position:0%
assessment that happens you know as they
become

01:42:11.450 --> 01:42:11.460 align:start position:0%
become
 
01:42:13.629 --> 01:42:13.639 align:start position:0%
um enrolled with deniquest
 
01:42:16.550 --> 01:42:16.560 align:start position:0%
if Transportation issues are identified
 
01:42:18.590 --> 01:42:18.600 align:start position:0%
as something that could potentially
 
01:42:21.109 --> 01:42:21.119 align:start position:0%
create a problem
 
01:42:23.330 --> 01:42:23.340 align:start position:0%
um they are also responsible for
 
01:42:25.490 --> 01:42:25.500 align:start position:0%
providing Transportation or mileage
 
01:42:28.430 --> 01:42:28.440 align:start position:0%
reimbursement so and those the the
 
01:42:30.490 --> 01:42:30.500 align:start position:0%
transportation and the Care Management
 
01:42:35.090 --> 01:42:35.100 align:start position:0%
really came about as a response to our
 
01:42:37.189 --> 01:42:37.199 align:start position:0%
work group where providers were talking
 
01:42:39.890 --> 01:42:39.900 align:start position:0%
about what are the things that we need
 
01:42:42.050 --> 01:42:42.060 align:start position:0%
to have in a benefit that would want
 
01:42:44.689 --> 01:42:44.699 align:start position:0%
make us want to enroll and then also
 
01:42:47.330 --> 01:42:47.340 align:start position:0%
stay in the program and it wasn't just
 
01:42:50.570 --> 01:42:50.580 align:start position:0%
reimbursement it was the no-shows and
 
01:42:52.850 --> 01:42:52.860 align:start position:0%
and transportation and Care Management
 
01:42:55.790 --> 01:42:55.800 align:start position:0%
follow-up representative thank you Mr I
 
01:42:56.810 --> 01:42:56.820 align:start position:0%
want to say thank you for the
 
01:42:59.450 --> 01:42:59.460 align:start position:0%
transportation to try to solve some of
 
01:43:01.189 --> 01:43:01.199 align:start position:0%
that issue
 
01:43:03.350 --> 01:43:03.360 align:start position:0%
however when I look at some of the rural
 
01:43:05.209 --> 01:43:05.219 align:start position:0%
parts of the state it's hard to get
 
01:43:07.070 --> 01:43:07.080 align:start position:0%
Transportation it's a real issue for
 
01:43:09.470 --> 01:43:09.480 align:start position:0%
patients even in medical care so again
 
01:43:11.209 --> 01:43:11.219 align:start position:0%
back the same thing if I understand this
 
01:43:12.709 --> 01:43:12.719 align:start position:0%
correctly not looking for the heat map
 
01:43:15.229 --> 01:43:15.239 align:start position:0%
but looking at the zip codes if in the
 
01:43:17.629 --> 01:43:17.639 align:start position:0%
rural parts of our state we're having a
 
01:43:20.209 --> 01:43:20.219 align:start position:0%
low provider participation and that's
 
01:43:21.950 --> 01:43:21.960 align:start position:0%
only going to be more critical that we
 
01:43:23.689 --> 01:43:23.699 align:start position:0%
have a way to get them to the dental
 
01:43:27.169 --> 01:43:27.179 align:start position:0%
clinic and I do concern myself when you
 
01:43:28.669 --> 01:43:28.679 align:start position:0%
get to some of these small towns even
 
01:43:30.709 --> 01:43:30.719 align:start position:0%
how we're going to get them to point A
 
01:43:32.450 --> 01:43:32.460 align:start position:0%
to point B from the home if you will to
 
01:43:34.490 --> 01:43:34.500 align:start position:0%
the dental clinic and that's again back
 
01:43:36.890 --> 01:43:36.900 align:start position:0%
to the underlying issue of
 
01:43:38.810 --> 01:43:38.820 align:start position:0%
what that means to the provider right
 
01:43:41.810 --> 01:43:41.820 align:start position:0%
and that and that also ties back to
 
01:43:44.450 --> 01:43:44.460 align:start position:0%
where we decide to take mobile clinics
 
01:43:46.189 --> 01:43:46.199 align:start position:0%
in the future you know that is another
 
01:43:48.729 --> 01:43:48.739 align:start position:0%
part of of that decision
 
01:43:51.770 --> 01:43:51.780 align:start position:0%
I heard you speak of the provider's work
 
01:43:54.590 --> 01:43:54.600 align:start position:0%
group prior to the rollout to identify
 
01:43:57.590 --> 01:43:57.600 align:start position:0%
things is there a provider work group
 
01:44:00.410 --> 01:44:00.420 align:start position:0%
that's going to meet periodically to
 
01:44:02.330 --> 01:44:02.340 align:start position:0%
assess let's say we've been doing this
 
01:44:03.470 --> 01:44:03.480 align:start position:0%
for a while now
 
01:44:06.070 --> 01:44:06.080 align:start position:0%
let's talk about it there are actually
 
01:44:09.410 --> 01:44:09.420 align:start position:0%
two uh different venues for that to
 
01:44:09.420 --> 01:44:10.370 align:start position:0%
two uh different venues for that to
happen

01:44:10.370 --> 01:44:10.380 align:start position:0%
happen
 
01:44:13.250 --> 01:44:13.260 align:start position:0%
um prior to us even going down this
 
01:44:15.649 --> 01:44:15.659 align:start position:0%
adventure with the adult benefit we have
 
01:44:17.689 --> 01:44:17.699 align:start position:0%
had a dental Medicaid advisory committee
 
01:44:21.229 --> 01:44:21.239 align:start position:0%
that was a joint function of DHHS and
 
01:44:23.570 --> 01:44:23.580 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Dental Society we are
 
01:44:25.850 --> 01:44:25.860 align:start position:0%
in full swing we have actually gone from
 
01:44:29.270 --> 01:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
quarterly meetings to monthly meetings
 
01:44:31.970 --> 01:44:31.980 align:start position:0%
um just so that we can keep on top of
 
01:44:34.430 --> 01:44:34.440 align:start position:0%
you know provider issues and and
 
01:44:37.729 --> 01:44:37.739 align:start position:0%
commentary and helping us to assess what
 
01:44:40.550 --> 01:44:40.560 align:start position:0%
is going on and then built into a
 
01:44:43.189 --> 01:44:43.199 align:start position:0%
contract with DentaQuest and Northeast
 
01:44:45.530 --> 01:44:45.540 align:start position:0%
Delta Dental there is a provider
 
01:44:48.109 --> 01:44:48.119 align:start position:0%
advisory committee and I know that they
 
01:44:50.750 --> 01:44:50.760 align:start position:0%
are in the process of putting together
 
01:44:54.410 --> 01:44:54.420 align:start position:0%
who from their provider network will be
 
01:44:56.990 --> 01:44:57.000 align:start position:0%
included in that so we have two
 
01:44:59.629 --> 01:44:59.639 align:start position:0%
different processes for providers to be
 
01:45:01.850 --> 01:45:01.860 align:start position:0%
giving feedback and and keeping an eye
 
01:45:04.010 --> 01:45:04.020 align:start position:0%
on things
 
01:45:06.530 --> 01:45:06.540 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards just just just
 
01:45:08.149 --> 01:45:08.159 align:start position:0%
two thoughts
 
01:45:10.010 --> 01:45:10.020 align:start position:0%
um I I don't know if you have a response
 
01:45:13.070 --> 01:45:13.080 align:start position:0%
to these two thoughts but um one on on
 
01:45:15.070 --> 01:45:15.080 align:start position:0%
that Excel sheet that we're looking for
 
01:45:18.530 --> 01:45:18.540 align:start position:0%
I think if it were just this ZIP codes
 
01:45:22.370 --> 01:45:22.380 align:start position:0%
of where you do have a provider rather
 
01:45:25.669 --> 01:45:25.679 align:start position:0%
than a zip codes where all the zip codes
 
01:45:27.590 --> 01:45:27.600 align:start position:0%
whether you have a provider or not I
 
01:45:29.990 --> 01:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
think it's just the zip codes that where
 
01:45:31.550 --> 01:45:31.560 align:start position:0%
you have a provider that would that
 
01:45:34.430 --> 01:45:34.440 align:start position:0%
would do my purposes
 
01:45:38.270 --> 01:45:38.280 align:start position:0%
um and and and then on the other
 
01:45:40.490 --> 01:45:40.500 align:start position:0%
um I I don't know where we are with the
 
01:45:42.229 --> 01:45:42.239 align:start position:0%
implementation of the closed loop
 
01:45:44.570 --> 01:45:44.580 align:start position:0%
referral system and so as I'm just
 
01:45:46.790 --> 01:45:46.800 align:start position:0%
trying to tie a couple weird puzzle
 
01:45:48.649 --> 01:45:48.659 align:start position:0%
pieces together I'm just wondering what
 
01:45:51.590 --> 01:45:51.600 align:start position:0%
the snow show issue if that closed-loop
 
01:45:55.370 --> 01:45:55.380 align:start position:0%
referral system might be a nice a nice
 
01:45:59.330 --> 01:45:59.340 align:start position:0%
tool to help you manage uh that
 
01:46:00.770 --> 01:46:00.780 align:start position:0%
yeah that's a really interesting
 
01:46:02.930 --> 01:46:02.940 align:start position:0%
connection to point out um I know that
 
01:46:04.850 --> 01:46:04.860 align:start position:0%
the closed loop referral system is not
 
01:46:06.109 --> 01:46:06.119 align:start position:0%
up and running
 
01:46:08.030 --> 01:46:08.040 align:start position:0%
um and I actually don't have today an
 
01:46:10.370 --> 01:46:10.380 align:start position:0%
update on when we might expect it to be
 
01:46:12.830 --> 01:46:12.840 align:start position:0%
in effect but you're absolutely right
 
01:46:15.470 --> 01:46:15.480 align:start position:0%
that I think we would want that to mesh
 
01:46:18.050 --> 01:46:18.060 align:start position:0%
appropriately with the dental services
 
01:46:22.450 --> 01:46:22.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:26.629 --> 01:46:26.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:26.639 --> 01:46:28.010 align:start position:0%
 
counselor

01:46:28.010 --> 01:46:28.020 align:start position:0%
counselor
 
01:46:30.050 --> 01:46:30.060 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman I can make your
 
01:46:32.870 --> 01:46:32.880 align:start position:0%
closing well I get the sense I might be
 
01:46:34.129 --> 01:46:34.139 align:start position:0%
the thing saying between you and a
 
01:46:37.129 --> 01:46:37.139 align:start position:0%
weekend so I'll try to be pretty brief
 
01:46:37.139 --> 01:46:38.149 align:start position:0%
weekend so I'll try to be pretty brief
um

01:46:38.149 --> 01:46:38.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:39.290 --> 01:46:39.300 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:46:40.550 --> 01:46:40.560 align:start position:0%
um obviously I'm going to speak on
 
01:46:42.530 --> 01:46:42.540 align:start position:0%
behalf of the Department's perspective
 
01:46:45.229 --> 01:46:45.239 align:start position:0%
of SB 263 I'm not going to tell you how
 
01:46:48.169 --> 01:46:48.179 align:start position:0%
you feel about 263.
 
01:46:50.930 --> 01:46:50.940 align:start position:0%
um so the Department's view of um the
 
01:46:53.990 --> 01:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
status of SB 263 is that it's pretty
 
01:46:57.350 --> 01:46:57.360 align:start position:0%
clear that there's a consensus that some
 
01:47:01.370 --> 01:47:01.380 align:start position:0%
form of the program needs to continue on
 
01:47:03.709 --> 01:47:03.719 align:start position:0%
the debate of course is centered around
 
01:47:07.430 --> 01:47:07.440 align:start position:0%
the duration of the program
 
01:47:08.990 --> 01:47:09.000 align:start position:0%
um uh the community engagement
 
01:47:10.729 --> 01:47:10.739 align:start position:0%
requirements came up quite a bit
 
01:47:13.129 --> 01:47:13.139 align:start position:0%
yesterday and it looked like there was a
 
01:47:15.050 --> 01:47:15.060 align:start position:0%
little bit of sprinkling of funding in
 
01:47:17.390 --> 01:47:17.400 align:start position:0%
there as well towards the end so
 
01:47:20.810 --> 01:47:20.820 align:start position:0%
obviously it's moved on to the fiscal
 
01:47:24.470 --> 01:47:24.480 align:start position:0%
committee unamended on amended I counted
 
01:47:29.350 --> 01:47:29.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:32.689 --> 01:47:32.699 align:start position:0%
did the spreadsheet counted 32 and 29
 
01:47:36.229 --> 01:47:36.239 align:start position:0%
were offered oh okay yeah and just to be
 
01:47:38.689 --> 01:47:38.699 align:start position:0%
clear it's the finance committee not the
 
01:47:41.450 --> 01:47:41.460 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee that it's working with
 
01:47:44.090 --> 01:47:44.100 align:start position:0%
entomologist I realized that after I
 
01:47:46.250 --> 01:47:46.260 align:start position:0%
said I misspoke but thank you for the
 
01:47:47.990 --> 01:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
correction so the department will
 
01:47:49.370 --> 01:47:49.380 align:start position:0%
obviously continue to work with the
 
01:47:51.950 --> 01:47:51.960 align:start position:0%
finance committee and be a resource to
 
01:47:53.629 --> 01:47:53.639 align:start position:0%
um this body as it moves to the
 
01:47:55.850 --> 01:47:55.860 align:start position:0%
deliberative process on where this
 
01:47:57.890 --> 01:47:57.900 align:start position:0%
program is going to go in the future and
 
01:47:59.870 --> 01:47:59.880 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take any questions at this
 
01:47:59.880 --> 01:48:05.930 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take any questions at this
point

01:48:05.930 --> 01:48:05.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:08.870 --> 01:48:08.880 align:start position:0%
that was that good huh you're allocuting
 
01:48:11.090 --> 01:48:11.100 align:start position:0%
that you stand between us and our
 
01:48:11.100 --> 01:48:11.950 align:start position:0%
that you stand between us and our
weekend

01:48:11.950 --> 01:48:11.960 align:start position:0%
weekend
 
01:48:18.050 --> 01:48:18.060 align:start position:0%
I will I I will just add that I mean the
 
01:48:20.270 --> 01:48:20.280 align:start position:0%
it all comes down in the end to the
 
01:48:21.590 --> 01:48:21.600 align:start position:0%
committee of conference and what the
 
01:48:23.270 --> 01:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
committee of conference does I mean the
 
01:48:26.689 --> 01:48:26.699 align:start position:0%
house has a position both on the on the
 
01:48:28.310 --> 01:48:28.320 align:start position:0%
health care policy the house has a
 
01:48:31.430 --> 01:48:31.440 align:start position:0%
current position on the budget and the
 
01:48:36.169 --> 01:48:36.179 align:start position:0%
Senate has a position which aligns with
 
01:48:39.169 --> 01:48:39.179 align:start position:0%
the house Health Care policy but not
 
01:48:41.950 --> 01:48:41.960 align:start position:0%
everybody in the house agrees with it so
 
01:48:45.290 --> 01:48:45.300 align:start position:0%
the committee of conference process is
 
01:48:47.270 --> 01:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
going to be a very interesting one in
 
01:48:49.250 --> 01:48:49.260 align:start position:0%
this case I would agree with that and
 
01:48:51.290 --> 01:48:51.300 align:start position:0%
we're uh and that's that's where it's
 
01:48:53.629 --> 01:48:53.639 align:start position:0%
all going to happen it's
 
01:48:56.990 --> 01:48:57.000 align:start position:0%
it irritates me as as one of the policy
 
01:49:00.530 --> 01:49:00.540 align:start position:0%
committees that we work on good policy
 
01:49:02.570 --> 01:49:02.580 align:start position:0%
all year long and then all of a sudden
 
01:49:04.550 --> 01:49:04.560 align:start position:0%
people vanish into a back room and
 
01:49:07.790 --> 01:49:07.800 align:start position:0%
emerge a week later with either white
 
01:49:09.910 --> 01:49:09.920 align:start position:0%
smoke or black smoke
 
01:49:12.590 --> 01:49:12.600 align:start position:0%
something that has things hidden in it
 
01:49:14.930 --> 01:49:14.940 align:start position:0%
that I find three months later all
 
01:49:16.970 --> 01:49:16.980 align:start position:0%
division three meetings are open and
 
01:49:19.669 --> 01:49:19.679 align:start position:0%
noticed I understand that but the
 
01:49:21.830 --> 01:49:21.840 align:start position:0%
committee of conference process is
 
01:49:24.709 --> 01:49:24.719 align:start position:0%
slightly different from that so just
 
01:49:29.149 --> 01:49:29.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:32.410 --> 01:49:32.420 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services yes
 
01:49:36.530 --> 01:49:36.540 align:start position:0%
wow okay uh our next meeting is the
 
01:49:39.350 --> 01:49:39.360 align:start position:0%
fourth Friday of June which is June 23
 
01:49:42.890 --> 01:49:42.900 align:start position:0%
10 a.m and please convey our regards to
