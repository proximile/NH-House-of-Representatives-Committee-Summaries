00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 align:start position:0%
first item on the regular calendar I
 
00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.330 align:start position:0%
first item on the regular calendar I
believe

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 align:start position:0%
believe
 
00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 align:start position:0%
so next stop is the officer professional
 
00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.809 align:start position:0%
so next stop is the officer professional
licensure

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 align:start position:0%
licensure
 
00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:26.879 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 align:start position:0%
uh some Mr Vice chair uh this is an
 
00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 align:start position:0%
interim Rule and it had quite a number
 
00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 align:start position:0%
of comments so uh
 
00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 align:start position:0%
would you prefer that I go through each
 
00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 align:start position:0%
one individually and then pass it over
 
00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
to the agency or we do one comment have
 
00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 align:start position:0%
the agency respond and go why don't you
 
00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 align:start position:0%
go through your list and then the agency
 
00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 align:start position:0%
can respond to your list sure absolutely
 
00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 align:start position:0%
so the first comment appears on page two
 
00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 align:start position:0%
of the rule page eight of the packet
 
00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 align:start position:0%
there's a website link on there that
 
00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 align:start position:0%
doesn't work and it doesn't spell out
 
00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 align:start position:0%
the URL so that wasn't unclear comment
 
00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 align:start position:0%
as this is a interim Rule and that needs
 
00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 align:start position:0%
to be easily accessible by the public
 
00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 align:start position:0%
there is a note to jail car on page
 
00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 align:start position:0%
three of the rule page nine of the
 
00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 align:start position:0%
packet just talking about uh the bill
 
00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.030 align:start position:0%
packet just talking about uh the bill
that

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 align:start position:0%
resulted in this interim rule
 
00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:21.800 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 align:start position:0%
1446 dissolved the recreational therapy
 
00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 align:start position:0%
governing board which was effective on
 
00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 align:start position:0%
July 19 2022 and made an Advisory Board
 
00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 align:start position:0%
under the oplc which ties into the note
 
00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 align:start position:0%
to jail car on the last page just
 
00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 align:start position:0%
informing the committee that at this
 
00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 align:start position:0%
time the recreational governing board
 
00:03:44.869 --> 00:03:44.879 align:start position:0%
had existing rules when this statute
 
00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 align:start position:0%
went into effect and those rules are
 
00:03:50.869 --> 00:03:50.879 align:start position:0%
still effective at this time as was
 
00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 align:start position:0%
discussed at the last meeting for
 
00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 align:start position:0%
interim rule seven there is now a
 
00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:56.819 align:start position:0%
question of who has the authority to
 
00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 align:start position:0%
repeal those rules
 
00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
which is an ongoing problem as there are
 
00:04:02.869 --> 00:04:02.879 align:start position:0%
two other
 
00:04:05.089 --> 00:04:05.099 align:start position:0%
boards that were under the spill that
 
00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:07.519 align:start position:0%
had the same thing occur
 
00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 align:start position:0%
moving on to the next substantive
 
00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 align:start position:0%
comment there was an edit unclear
 
00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 align:start position:0%
comment on page three of the rules
 
00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 align:start position:0%
um it mentions the retention schedule
 
00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:19.139 align:start position:0%
established pursuant to the statute but
 
00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 align:start position:0%
the statute does not lay out the
 
00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 align:start position:0%
retention schedule it gives the oplc the
 
00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 align:start position:0%
authority to create that schedule and
 
00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 align:start position:0%
there's no site to the retention
 
00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:30.419 align:start position:0%
schedule in that particular Rule and it
 
00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:32.040 align:start position:0%
does not lay out the schedule in that
 
00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 align:start position:0%
rule there's a legislative intent
 
00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 align:start position:0%
comment on page 10. saying the executive
 
00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 align:start position:0%
director May Grant initial licenses but
 
00:04:41.749 --> 00:04:41.759 align:start position:0%
it doesn't State what the criteria are
 
00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:44.100 align:start position:0%
for which licenses will be granted or
 
00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
how the licenses will be
 
00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:48.290 align:start position:0%
how the licenses will be
um

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:04:51.249 --> 00:04:51.259 align:start position:0%
viewed to see which ones will be
 
00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 align:start position:0%
granted which could result in oral rule
 
00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:58.620 align:start position:0%
making and violation of RSA 541a221
 
00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:00.600 align:start position:0%
there's another unclear comment on page
 
00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:03.540 align:start position:0%
10 once again having to do with
 
00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.030 align:start position:0%
10 once again having to do with
um

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:05.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry uh having to do with the
 
00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:09.600 align:start position:0%
board's website and the fee amount
 
00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:11.940 align:start position:0%
that's listed in the rule the amount
 
00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:13.139 align:start position:0%
listed in the rule is different than
 
00:05:16.249 --> 00:05:16.259 align:start position:0%
what's in the board's website
 
00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:16.909 align:start position:0%
what's in the board's website
um

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:16.919 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 align:start position:0%
a screenshot of the board's website is
 
00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:22.320 align:start position:0%
attached in the final in the interim
 
00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:23.639 align:start position:0%
rule packet
 
00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:26.520 align:start position:0%
and the same comment appears on uh page
 
00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:30.180 align:start position:0%
19 as there's another rule another fee
 
00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:31.560 align:start position:0%
amount cited that's different from
 
00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:34.680 align:start position:0%
what's on the board's website
 
00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:36.780 align:start position:0%
there's an edit unclear comment on page
 
00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:40.560 align:start position:0%
five where the form submitted to OLS
 
00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:42.720 align:start position:0%
only lists a space for the length of
 
00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:44.090 align:start position:0%
only lists a space for the length of
experience

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:44.100 align:start position:0%
experience
 
00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:47.880 align:start position:0%
when it states that the licensee must
 
00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:48.950 align:start position:0%
when it states that the licensee must
have

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:48.960 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:52.380 align:start position:0%
the same uh crite or has met the same
 
00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:54.419 align:start position:0%
criteria as was previously needed so
 
00:05:56.689 --> 00:05:56.699 align:start position:0%
it's unclear what criteria is being
 
00:05:58.909 --> 00:05:58.919 align:start position:0%
considered as the form only has that one
 
00:06:01.689 --> 00:06:01.699 align:start position:0%
space for the length of experience
 
00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:04.860 align:start position:0%
unclear on page 12.
 
00:06:06.409 --> 00:06:06.419 align:start position:0%
and the rule says when the application
 
00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:08.580 align:start position:0%
becomes available online
 
00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:10.860 align:start position:0%
but the oplc website says that paper
 
00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:13.740 align:start position:0%
applications are no longer accepted so
 
00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:15.600 align:start position:0%
there is a discrepancy on there as well
 
00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:17.340 align:start position:0%
and once again there is a screenshot of
 
00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
the oplc's website in the packet
 
00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:22.800 align:start position:0%
there's an unclear comment on page 10
 
00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:25.880 align:start position:0%
that says to pay the fee in PLC
 
00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:28.860 align:start position:0%
1001 for recreational therapists but as
 
00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:31.080 align:start position:0%
of now that particular rule does not
 
00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:34.020 align:start position:0%
exist there's no mention of fees for
 
00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:37.800 align:start position:0%
recreational therapists in the PLC 1000s
 
00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:39.600 align:start position:0%
and there's also no mention of the fee
 
00:06:41.749 --> 00:06:41.759 align:start position:0%
on the website
 
00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
there's an unclear uh comment on page
 
00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:47.300 align:start position:0%
13. where the rule uses the language
 
00:06:50.029 --> 00:06:50.039 align:start position:0%
that the licensees
 
00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:53.060 align:start position:0%
will be notified when
 
00:06:58.010 --> 00:06:58.020 align:start position:0%
the website is under contract to notify
 
00:07:00.409 --> 00:07:00.419 align:start position:0%
so that the licenses might start using
 
00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:02.100 align:start position:0%
the website as opposed to submitting
 
00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:04.380 align:start position:0%
things directly to the oplc
 
00:07:07.129 --> 00:07:07.139 align:start position:0%
that language is unclear because
 
00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:09.240 align:start position:0%
saying under contract doesn't mean that
 
00:07:10.969 --> 00:07:10.979 align:start position:0%
the site is operational and there could
 
00:07:13.249 --> 00:07:13.259 align:start position:0%
be a amount of time between when
 
00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:14.940 align:start position:0%
something becomes under contract to when
 
00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:18.360 align:start position:0%
it is actually operational
 
00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:20.840 align:start position:0%
there's another unclear comment on page
 
00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:24.780 align:start position:0%
13. uh the rule as worded said
 
00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:27.650 align:start position:0%
until an online system becomes available
 
00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:29.330 align:start position:0%
until an online system becomes available
[Music]

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:29.340 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:31.940 align:start position:0%
the oplc will use this particular
 
00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:34.800 align:start position:0%
auditing process but it does not specify
 
00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:38.460 align:start position:0%
what the auditing process will be after
 
00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:42.180 align:start position:0%
the system becomes online
 
00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:44.940 align:start position:0%
on page 19 as well there's another
 
00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:46.860 align:start position:0%
unclear comment
 
00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:48.660 align:start position:0%
which states
 
00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:51.660 align:start position:0%
um for which disciplinary action can be
 
00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
taken once again it does not establish
 
00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:56.520 align:start position:0%
criteria of when the disciplinary action
 
00:07:59.270 --> 00:07:59.280 align:start position:0%
will be taken and also does not cite the
 
00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:01.280 align:start position:0%
rules that disa that deal with
 
00:08:04.129 --> 00:08:04.139 align:start position:0%
disciplinary action so what disciplinary
 
00:08:04.139 --> 00:08:05.330 align:start position:0%
disciplinary action so what disciplinary
action

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:05.340 align:start position:0%
action
 
00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
could potentially be taken and so once
 
00:08:10.249 --> 00:08:10.259 align:start position:0%
again that leaves room for oral rule
 
00:08:11.629 --> 00:08:11.639 align:start position:0%
making which could be in violation of
 
00:08:16.749 --> 00:08:16.759 align:start position:0%
RSA 541a 22 1. thank you
 
00:08:19.189 --> 00:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
got all that Courtney
 
00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:22.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:24.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:27.120 align:start position:0%
um Senator Ling Mr Vice chair and um
 
00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:28.440 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:29.940 align:start position:0%
my name is Lindsey Corney I'm the
 
00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:32.760 align:start position:0%
executive director of oplc so just
 
00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
before I address specific comments this
 
00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:37.680 align:start position:0%
board was converted to an Advisory Board
 
00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:40.620 align:start position:0%
last session because we had Quorum
 
00:08:44.029 --> 00:08:44.039 align:start position:0%
issues that I believe that the prior
 
00:08:45.769 --> 00:08:45.779 align:start position:0%
governing board had not met for about a
 
00:08:47.389 --> 00:08:47.399 align:start position:0%
year and a half and so there were issues
 
00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:49.200 align:start position:0%
with the ability to obviously regulate
 
00:08:52.009 --> 00:08:52.019 align:start position:0%
but also to license applicants so what
 
00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:55.140 align:start position:0%
we did in terms of moving forward with
 
00:08:57.230 --> 00:08:57.240 align:start position:0%
interim rules is we largely took what
 
00:08:59.449 --> 00:08:59.459 align:start position:0%
was existing so that we could get them
 
00:09:02.690 --> 00:09:02.700 align:start position:0%
in the PLC rules and we are now
 
00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:05.100 align:start position:0%
proceeding with drafting the regular
 
00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:08.100 align:start position:0%
rulemaking process which will include an
 
00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:10.920 align:start position:0%
advanced public comment period in early
 
00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:13.160 align:start position:0%
January so to the extent that there are
 
00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:15.240 align:start position:0%
substantive changes that need to happen
 
00:09:17.329 --> 00:09:17.339 align:start position:0%
as well as comments that we should
 
00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:19.980 align:start position:0%
respond to that OLS has provided we
 
00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:21.540 align:start position:0%
would suggest that that would be the
 
00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
best time to do it
 
00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:27.540 align:start position:0%
um in terms of specific comments
 
00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:30.360 align:start position:0%
um the uh
 
00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:32.160 align:start position:0%
I guess I'll start with the retention
 
00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:35.160 align:start position:0%
schedule issue their retention schedules
 
00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:36.600 align:start position:0%
are filed generally with the state
 
00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:39.360 align:start position:0%
archives that has been approved we're
 
00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:41.820 align:start position:0%
happy to post that on our website but
 
00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:42.590 align:start position:0%
happy to post that on our website but
that

00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:42.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:09:44.329 --> 00:09:44.339 align:start position:0%
um is typically done outside of the
 
00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:46.680 align:start position:0%
rulemaking process and we did just get
 
00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:48.480 align:start position:0%
approval from the Secretary of State's
 
00:09:50.829 --> 00:09:50.839 align:start position:0%
office regarding our retention schedule
 
00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
in terms of the fee issues there are
 
00:09:57.590 --> 00:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
different fees currently located on our
 
00:09:59.509 --> 00:09:59.519 align:start position:0%
website because the fees have yet to be
 
00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
changed so if we if we do get approval
 
00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:07.980 align:start position:0%
um if these rules are approved we will
 
00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
have an effective date that post dates
 
00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:13.500 align:start position:0%
this meeting and we'll make sure that
 
00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:15.420 align:start position:0%
the website lines up appropriately with
 
00:10:17.269 --> 00:10:17.279 align:start position:0%
whatever the fees are
 
00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:24.170 align:start position:0%
 
see

00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:24.180 align:start position:0%
see
 
00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:29.120 align:start position:0%
temporary license fee issue the PLC
 
00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:32.220 align:start position:0%
1001.07 was actually on consent today so
 
00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
I I do believe that that issue has been
 
00:10:36.949 --> 00:10:36.959 align:start position:0%
resolved and that the committee has
 
00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:40.980 align:start position:0%
approved a change of a fee from 100 to
 
00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:43.740 align:start position:0%
25 and again we'll adjust that on the
 
00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:46.680 align:start position:0%
website as needed in terms of discipline
 
00:10:50.090 --> 00:10:50.100 align:start position:0%
we would suggest that our PLC 200s are
 
00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
the appropriate regulatory Authority for
 
00:10:57.050 --> 00:10:57.060 align:start position:0%
disciplinary issues we're not ever going
 
00:10:59.329 --> 00:10:59.339 align:start position:0%
to be able to fully capture every
 
00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:01.320 align:start position:0%
instance in which disciplinary action is
 
00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:02.640 align:start position:0%
warranted but I think that the
 
00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:05.160 align:start position:0%
procedures are well laid out in PLC 200s
 
00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:07.860 align:start position:0%
and we can certainly respond more
 
00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
clearly with regular rulemaking to OLS
 
00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:12.590 align:start position:0%
clearly with regular rulemaking to OLS
comments

00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:12.600 align:start position:0%
comments
 
00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
um and then I think I had a couple of
 
00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
others I apologize
 
00:11:20.269 --> 00:11:20.279 align:start position:0%
um some of the website link stuff we can
 
00:11:20.279 --> 00:11:21.590 align:start position:0%
um some of the website link stuff we can
um

00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:23.509 --> 00:11:23.519 align:start position:0%
we can either make that change it the
 
00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:25.200 align:start position:0%
links work for us when we tried it so I
 
00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:26.700 align:start position:0%
apologize that there that they didn't
 
00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:28.740 align:start position:0%
work our intent was not to incorporate a
 
00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:31.140 align:start position:0%
website by reference
 
00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:33.540 align:start position:0%
um so we can certainly when we proceed
 
00:11:35.509 --> 00:11:35.519 align:start position:0%
to regular rulemaking make sure that the
 
00:11:39.829 --> 00:11:39.839 align:start position:0%
link is is is working as necessary
 
00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:42.360 align:start position:0%
um and then in terms of on page four
 
00:11:45.250 --> 00:11:45.260 align:start position:0%
there was a question about
 
00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:48.540 align:start position:0%
licensees who essentially were blanketed
 
00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:50.220 align:start position:0%
and grandfathered in whatever phrase you
 
00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:52.500 align:start position:0%
want to use it at the time that
 
00:11:54.350 --> 00:11:54.360 align:start position:0%
recreational therapy licensure was
 
00:11:57.350 --> 00:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
required it basically stated that the
 
00:12:01.009 --> 00:12:01.019 align:start position:0%
board can issue May issue licenses to
 
00:12:02.569 --> 00:12:02.579 align:start position:0%
individuals who had already been
 
00:12:05.389 --> 00:12:05.399 align:start position:0%
practicing with certain credentials if
 
00:12:06.949 --> 00:12:06.959 align:start position:0%
they had received a credential prior to
 
00:12:09.650 --> 00:12:09.660 align:start position:0%
I think it was 2007. practically I don't
 
00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:11.480 align:start position:0%
think this is an issue anymore because
 
00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:13.740 align:start position:0%
licensure is now required so they would
 
00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:17.540 align:start position:0%
have to go through the regular process
 
00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:21.540 align:start position:0%
and we would suggest that we probably
 
00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:24.120 align:start position:0%
eliminate this as we proceed with rather
 
00:12:26.449 --> 00:12:26.459 align:start position:0%
regular rulemaking but we elected to
 
00:12:27.889 --> 00:12:27.899 align:start position:0%
keep it in to avoid making any
 
00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:30.600 align:start position:0%
substantive changes until the regular
 
00:12:32.389 --> 00:12:32.399 align:start position:0%
rulemaking process and we can receive
 
00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:36.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:37.970 --> 00:12:37.980 align:start position:0%
I think those were the are the comments
 
00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
that I would generally offer but I'm
 
00:12:41.449 --> 00:12:41.459 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions the
 
00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:43.980 align:start position:0%
committee may have
 
00:12:45.410 --> 00:12:45.420 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:12:47.449 --> 00:12:47.459 align:start position:0%
so Mike I'm going to ask you if you
 
00:12:49.190 --> 00:12:49.200 align:start position:0%
don't mind put you on the spot there are
 
00:12:51.410 --> 00:12:51.420 align:start position:0%
a lot of new members and so understand
 
00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:53.160 align:start position:0%
the difference between you know a
 
00:12:54.949 --> 00:12:54.959 align:start position:0%
conditional rule an interim rule final
 
00:12:57.230 --> 00:12:57.240 align:start position:0%
Rule and understanding what that means
 
00:12:58.670 --> 00:12:58.680 align:start position:0%
to the members and what we're approving
 
00:13:00.290 --> 00:13:00.300 align:start position:0%
could you kind of run through that for
 
00:13:03.530 --> 00:13:03.540 align:start position:0%
the members I will this is an interim
 
00:13:06.650 --> 00:13:06.660 align:start position:0%
rule it if adopted it would only be in
 
00:13:08.889 --> 00:13:08.899 align:start position:0%
effect for 180 days
 
00:13:11.269 --> 00:13:11.279 align:start position:0%
in the meantime the agency would go
 
00:13:13.069 --> 00:13:13.079 align:start position:0%
through regular rulemaking to replace
 
00:13:16.069 --> 00:13:16.079 align:start position:0%
the interim rule that's often been the
 
00:13:18.650 --> 00:13:18.660 align:start position:0%
committee's practice in the case of an
 
00:13:21.170 --> 00:13:21.180 align:start position:0%
interim rule that they do as suggested
 
00:13:24.949 --> 00:13:24.959 align:start position:0%
by director Courtney I mean
 
00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:27.240 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:13:28.970 --> 00:13:28.980 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:32.100 align:start position:0%
there be a recommendation or uh
 
00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:34.500 align:start position:0%
understanding by the committee when they
 
00:13:36.590 --> 00:13:36.600 align:start position:0%
approve the rule that the issues that
 
00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:38.760 align:start position:0%
are in there by raised by committee
 
00:13:40.610 --> 00:13:40.620 align:start position:0%
staff would be addressed during a
 
00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:42.720 align:start position:0%
regular roommate however if the
 
00:13:44.030 --> 00:13:44.040 align:start position:0%
committee feels that some of these
 
00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:46.440 align:start position:0%
issues are so important that they need
 
00:13:48.829 --> 00:13:48.839 align:start position:0%
to be addressed immediately a committee
 
00:13:52.449 --> 00:13:52.459 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:57.230 --> 00:13:57.240 align:start position:0%
thank you so uh uh Miss Courtney the the
 
00:13:59.329 --> 00:13:59.339 align:start position:0%
um edits that they have made you're
 
00:14:01.490 --> 00:14:01.500 align:start position:0%
acceptable the edits and comments that
 
00:14:03.769 --> 00:14:03.779 align:start position:0%
the uh and we could adopt the rule with
 
00:14:05.690 --> 00:14:05.700 align:start position:0%
the edits inclusive that we talked about
 
00:14:08.389 --> 00:14:08.399 align:start position:0%
yes okay
 
00:14:10.370 --> 00:14:10.380 align:start position:0%
any further questions from committee
 
00:14:16.250 --> 00:14:16.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:18.410 --> 00:14:18.420 align:start position:0%
hearing none Mr chairman I will move to
 
00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
approve with the recommendation that was
 
00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:23.150 align:start position:0%
approve with the recommendation that was
referenced

00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:23.160 align:start position:0%
referenced
 
00:14:25.610 --> 00:14:25.620 align:start position:0%
it's been moved to approve the interim
 
00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:27.600 align:start position:0%
rules with the edits suggested by staff
 
00:14:29.389 --> 00:14:29.399 align:start position:0%
is there a second
 
00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:31.200 align:start position:0%
it's been second by Senate award any
 
00:14:34.009 --> 00:14:34.019 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
00:14:36.050 --> 00:14:36.060 align:start position:0%
seeing none all those in favor say aye
 
00:14:38.449 --> 00:14:38.459 align:start position:0%
aye opposed name
 
00:14:40.490 --> 00:14:40.500 align:start position:0%
eyes have it and the interim rule is
 
00:14:43.610 --> 00:14:43.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:46.389 --> 00:14:46.399 align:start position:0%
next up is the board of natural
 
00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:51.000 align:start position:0%
scientists uh rule 2277.
 
00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:53.820 align:start position:0%
so this is a conditional approval which
 
00:14:56.750 --> 00:14:56.760 align:start position:0%
means they they did a final approval
 
00:14:58.910 --> 00:14:58.920 align:start position:0%
sorry they did a final proposal and I
 
00:15:00.829 --> 00:15:00.839 align:start position:0%
reviewed it and they came back with with
 
00:15:03.889 --> 00:15:03.899 align:start position:0%
more edits so you'll be voting on The
 
00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:06.120 align:start position:0%
conditional approval text
 
00:15:08.269 --> 00:15:08.279 align:start position:0%
um there's actually only one issue with
 
00:15:11.389 --> 00:15:11.399 align:start position:0%
this Rule and that is that on page two
 
00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:13.560 align:start position:0%
of the conditional approval
 
00:15:15.769 --> 00:15:15.779 align:start position:0%
um there's one section of rules that has
 
00:15:19.009 --> 00:15:19.019 align:start position:0%
been expired since 2019
 
00:15:21.889 --> 00:15:21.899 align:start position:0%
um their those rules are about the
 
00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:24.720 align:start position:0%
explanation of a rule after it's been
 
00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:26.689 align:start position:0%
explanation of a rule after it's been
adopted

00:15:26.689 --> 00:15:26.699 align:start position:0%
adopted
 
00:15:28.550 --> 00:15:28.560 align:start position:0%
um and so I
 
00:15:30.889 --> 00:15:30.899 align:start position:0%
the gel car may have questions about how
 
00:15:32.569 --> 00:15:32.579 align:start position:0%
they were doing that during the
 
00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:34.860 align:start position:0%
expiration period thank you just one
 
00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:37.380 align:start position:0%
second so generally the idea is agencies
 
00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:38.940 align:start position:0%
aren't allowed to enforce rules once
 
00:15:40.970 --> 00:15:40.980 align:start position:0%
rules have expired so the standard
 
00:15:43.009 --> 00:15:43.019 align:start position:0%
question is how have you been forcing
 
00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:43.980 align:start position:0%
the rule or have there been any
 
00:15:45.829 --> 00:15:45.839 align:start position:0%
enforcement actions on the rule after it
 
00:15:45.839 --> 00:15:48.350 align:start position:0%
enforcement actions on the rule after it
expired

00:15:48.350 --> 00:15:48.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:49.800 align:start position:0%
I'm Tina Kelly
 
00:15:51.889 --> 00:15:51.899 align:start position:0%
on the program specialists at the office
 
00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:53.160 align:start position:0%
of professional licensure and
 
00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
certification and with regard to this
 
00:15:58.069 --> 00:15:58.079 align:start position:0%
particular rule there would be two other
 
00:15:58.079 --> 00:15:59.290 align:start position:0%
particular rule there would be two other
um

00:15:59.290 --> 00:15:59.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:01.970 --> 00:16:01.980 align:start position:0%
guidance that would be accepted because
 
00:16:03.949 --> 00:16:03.959 align:start position:0%
it's an explanation after adoption of a
 
00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:06.540 align:start position:0%
rule it would be both 91a and for any
 
00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:09.680 align:start position:0%
procedural Justice 800s we would rely on
 
00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:13.260 align:start position:0%
and I am not sure I haven't seen
 
00:16:18.829 --> 00:16:18.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
any further questions from the committee
 
00:16:24.769 --> 00:16:24.779 align:start position:0%
and staff we're we're good with there's
 
00:16:27.650 --> 00:16:27.660 align:start position:0%
there's no further edits needed on this
 
00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:30.360 align:start position:0%
no the the rule other than that is fine
 
00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:32.689 align:start position:0%
no the the rule other than that is fine
great

00:16:32.689 --> 00:16:32.699 align:start position:0%
great
 
00:16:34.610 --> 00:16:34.620 align:start position:0%
um except to be looking for a motion to
 
00:16:36.949 --> 00:16:36.959 align:start position:0%
approve the conditional so moved it's
 
00:16:38.449 --> 00:16:38.459 align:start position:0%
been moved for uh to approve the
 
00:16:39.650 --> 00:16:39.660 align:start position:0%
conditional rule is there a second
 
00:16:41.329 --> 00:16:41.339 align:start position:0%
second it's been second by
 
00:16:43.249 --> 00:16:43.259 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn any further
 
00:16:43.259 --> 00:16:44.749 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn any further
discussion

00:16:44.749 --> 00:16:44.759 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
00:16:47.509 --> 00:16:47.519 align:start position:0%
seeing none uh all those in favor say
 
00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
aye aye opposed nay eyes have it then
 
00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:54.420 align:start position:0%
your rules adopted thank you
 
00:16:56.509 --> 00:16:56.519 align:start position:0%
next up is the Department of Safety
 
00:16:58.870 --> 00:16:58.880 align:start position:0%
vehicle registration rules
 
00:17:01.970 --> 00:17:01.980 align:start position:0%
2284. Steph
 
00:17:04.309 --> 00:17:04.319 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr Vice chair
 
00:17:04.319 --> 00:17:05.569 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr Vice chair
so

00:17:05.569 --> 00:17:05.579 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:17:07.730 --> 00:17:07.740 align:start position:0%
the only substantive comments on this
 
00:17:09.890 --> 00:17:09.900 align:start position:0%
particular rule had to do with the forms
 
00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:12.780 align:start position:0%
just so the committee is aware forms are
 
00:17:14.870 --> 00:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
considered rules under the statute and
 
00:17:16.189 --> 00:17:16.199 align:start position:0%
therefore have to go through the rule
 
00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
making process
 
00:17:20.449 --> 00:17:20.459 align:start position:0%
so the issue with the forms that were
 
00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:22.260 align:start position:0%
Incorporated by reference in this rule
 
00:17:25.189 --> 00:17:25.199 align:start position:0%
is that some of them had revision dates
 
00:17:27.530 --> 00:17:27.540 align:start position:0%
that did not correspond with rulemaking
 
00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:30.240 align:start position:0%
so olfs did ask for the Department for
 
00:17:33.650 --> 00:17:33.660 align:start position:0%
an explanation and after submitting the
 
00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:35.940 align:start position:0%
final packet did receive some additional
 
00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:38.100 align:start position:0%
information for the department so with
 
00:17:41.090 --> 00:17:41.100 align:start position:0%
regard to the comment on page seven of
 
00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:42.240 align:start position:0%
the rule
 
00:17:44.210 --> 00:17:44.220 align:start position:0%
it was explained that this is actually a
 
00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:46.200 align:start position:0%
new form that is being adopted with
 
00:17:48.169 --> 00:17:48.179 align:start position:0%
these particular rules so that
 
00:17:49.669 --> 00:17:49.679 align:start position:0%
substantive comment would actually be
 
00:17:52.190 --> 00:17:52.200 align:start position:0%
converted to an editorial comment that
 
00:17:54.110 --> 00:17:54.120 align:start position:0%
the date just needs to correspond for
 
00:17:56.090 --> 00:17:56.100 align:start position:0%
when the rules are approved by this
 
00:17:57.890 --> 00:17:57.900 align:start position:0%
committee and adopted
 
00:17:59.690 --> 00:17:59.700 align:start position:0%
with regard to
 
00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:03.480 align:start position:0%
the uh substantive comments on page 13
 
00:18:05.930 --> 00:18:05.940 align:start position:0%
and 17 those two
 
00:18:09.289 --> 00:18:09.299 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry page 17 and
 
00:18:16.370 --> 00:18:16.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:20.400 align:start position:0%
uh page 61 of the rules those two forms
 
00:18:22.909 --> 00:18:22.919 align:start position:0%
was explained that they had very minor
 
00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:26.400 align:start position:0%
editorial changes which are allowed
 
00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:29.160 align:start position:0%
outside of the rulemaking process
 
00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:31.440 align:start position:0%
um as they weren't substantive and did
 
00:18:34.250 --> 00:18:34.260 align:start position:0%
not affect anything to do with the
 
00:18:36.529 --> 00:18:36.539 align:start position:0%
information being provided so those
 
00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:38.940 align:start position:0%
comments have been removed in the final
 
00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:42.900 align:start position:0%
form on page 13 of the rules that one
 
00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:46.200 align:start position:0%
does remain a substantive comment as the
 
00:18:47.810 --> 00:18:47.820 align:start position:0%
information provided shows that this
 
00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:49.500 align:start position:0%
particular form was substantially
 
00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
revised outside of the rulemaking
 
00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:53.289 align:start position:0%
revised outside of the rulemaking
process

00:18:53.289 --> 00:18:53.299 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:18:56.690 --> 00:18:56.700 align:start position:0%
and therefore if the committee has any
 
00:18:58.130 --> 00:18:58.140 align:start position:0%
questions for the Department we wanted
 
00:18:59.690 --> 00:18:59.700 align:start position:0%
to leave that on the regular agenda for
 
00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:14.090 --> 00:19:14.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:15.789 --> 00:19:15.799 align:start position:0%
can you hear me
 
00:19:18.529 --> 00:19:18.539 align:start position:0%
my name's martiniani from the Department
 
00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:20.340 align:start position:0%
of Safety
 
00:19:23.930 --> 00:19:23.940 align:start position:0%
um the issue with the vanity plate the
 
00:19:27.490 --> 00:19:27.500 align:start position:0%
we went through rule making back in 2019
 
00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:29.820 align:start position:0%
and adopted
 
00:19:32.990 --> 00:19:33.000 align:start position:0%
um rules to reflect that there are new
 
00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
you could get vanity plates for
 
00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:39.960 align:start position:0%
um decals and motorcycle so it's number
 
00:19:43.490 --> 00:19:43.500 align:start position:0%
16 17 and 18. so the form was changed to
 
00:19:46.010 --> 00:19:46.020 align:start position:0%
reflect that you could check those boxes
 
00:19:48.169 --> 00:19:48.179 align:start position:0%
off as well and that has an effective
 
00:19:51.650 --> 00:19:51.660 align:start position:0%
date of January of 20 which was a month
 
00:19:54.409 --> 00:19:54.419 align:start position:0%
after the rules were adopted the form
 
00:19:56.750 --> 00:19:56.760 align:start position:0%
was not Incorporated by reference in the
 
00:19:59.390 --> 00:19:59.400 align:start position:0%
rules so I I that's the only substantive
 
00:20:02.510 --> 00:20:02.520 align:start position:0%
comment uh substantive change to that
 
00:20:04.490 --> 00:20:04.500 align:start position:0%
rule and then of course editorially the
 
00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:09.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:12.049 --> 00:20:12.059 align:start position:0%
uh so that is correct the particular
 
00:20:14.029 --> 00:20:14.039 align:start position:0%
section that incorporates that form by
 
00:20:15.770 --> 00:20:15.780 align:start position:0%
reference was not included in those
 
00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:18.480 align:start position:0%
November rules which is why the form was
 
00:20:19.730 --> 00:20:19.740 align:start position:0%
technically amended outside the
 
00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:26.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:28.850 --> 00:20:28.860 align:start position:0%
is the form in here the the new form
 
00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:30.600 align:start position:0%
that one that was adopted 120 for
 
00:20:33.049 --> 00:20:33.059 align:start position:0%
reference is that in here as far as the
 
00:20:36.169 --> 00:20:36.179 align:start position:0%
agents that we've seen it uh the copy of
 
00:20:37.850 --> 00:20:37.860 align:start position:0%
that form is included in the packet yes
 
00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:40.150 align:start position:0%
that form is included in the packet yes
okay

00:20:40.150 --> 00:20:40.160 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:43.320 align:start position:0%
any further comments by committee
 
00:20:47.570 --> 00:20:47.580 align:start position:0%
so I back uh our our we can either we
 
00:20:49.610 --> 00:20:49.620 align:start position:0%
can adopt the form uh understanding that
 
00:20:51.049 --> 00:20:51.059 align:start position:0%
they need to deal with this form that
 
00:20:52.490 --> 00:20:52.500 align:start position:0%
has to either come back to rule making
 
00:20:56.150 --> 00:20:56.160 align:start position:0%
so they can adopt it is that correct
 
00:20:59.630 --> 00:20:59.640 align:start position:0%
um at this time if you a uh adopt or
 
00:21:01.669 --> 00:21:01.679 align:start position:0%
approve these particular rules in the
 
00:21:04.370 --> 00:21:04.380 align:start position:0%
agency adopts them the effective date of
 
00:21:06.710 --> 00:21:06.720 align:start position:0%
the form would change to the date of
 
00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
now yes um the only reason that that was
 
00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
made a substantive common is just so the
 
00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:13.740 align:start position:0%
committee is aware that the agency did
 
00:21:14.990 --> 00:21:15.000 align:start position:0%
make those changes outside the
 
00:21:17.810 --> 00:21:17.820 align:start position:0%
rulemaking process great thank you any
 
00:21:19.669 --> 00:21:19.679 align:start position:0%
further discussion for the agency or
 
00:21:22.370 --> 00:21:22.380 align:start position:0%
questions for the agency
 
00:21:27.169 --> 00:21:27.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:28.669 --> 00:21:28.679 align:start position:0%
it's been moved by representative Lynn
 
00:21:30.289 --> 00:21:30.299 align:start position:0%
is there a second
 
00:21:32.510 --> 00:21:32.520 align:start position:0%
it's been second by Senator Ward
 
00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:37.370 --> 00:21:37.380 align:start position:0%
seeing that emotion is to approve the
 
00:21:39.890 --> 00:21:39.900 align:start position:0%

00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:40.669 align:start position:0%

you
 
00:21:52.370 --> 00:21:52.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:55.430 --> 00:21:55.440 align:start position:0%
next up is 22.99
 
00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:56.630 align:start position:0%
next up is 22.99
um

00:21:56.630 --> 00:21:56.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:58.310 --> 00:21:58.320 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
00:22:01.310 --> 00:22:01.320 align:start position:0%
on a radiation safety requirements for
 
00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
wire line service operators and
 
00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:06.120 align:start position:0%
subsurface Tracer studies
 
00:22:08.570 --> 00:22:08.580 align:start position:0%
sir um I'm actually going to take both
 
00:22:11.690 --> 00:22:11.700 align:start position:0%
of these two together the next one is
 
00:22:15.710 --> 00:22:15.720 align:start position:0%
also another rad roll so the agency is
 
00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
requesting a postponement to the January
 
00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:19.090 align:start position:0%
requesting a postponement to the January
meeting

00:22:19.090 --> 00:22:19.100 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
00:22:21.710 --> 00:22:21.720 align:start position:0%
you still need to vote on when that
 
00:22:23.570 --> 00:22:23.580 align:start position:0%
January meeting will take place but the
 
00:22:25.010 --> 00:22:25.020 align:start position:0%
agency would like to request a
 
00:22:27.169 --> 00:22:27.179 align:start position:0%
postponement and in order to do so you
 
00:22:29.270 --> 00:22:29.280 align:start position:0%
will need to request a waiver of your
 
00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:30.770 align:start position:0%
will need to request a waiver of your
deadline

00:22:30.770 --> 00:22:30.780 align:start position:0%
deadline
 
00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:32.760 align:start position:0%
thank you so again remember for the new
 
00:22:34.789 --> 00:22:34.799 align:start position:0%
members so agencies we have a certain
 
00:22:36.890 --> 00:22:36.900 align:start position:0%
deadline in order to act on rules if we
 
00:22:39.470 --> 00:22:39.480 align:start position:0%
need to if for some reason the agency in
 
00:22:41.270 --> 00:22:41.280 align:start position:0%
this case needs an extension to be able
 
00:22:43.070 --> 00:22:43.080 align:start position:0%
to work on it we have to waive that rule
 
00:22:44.750 --> 00:22:44.760 align:start position:0%
so that they have time to work on it and
 
00:22:47.210 --> 00:22:47.220 align:start position:0%
come back after the normal deadline so
 
00:22:50.090 --> 00:22:50.100 align:start position:0%
I'd entertain a motion to wave
 
00:22:53.630 --> 00:22:53.640 align:start position:0%
um wave rules and postpone items 22.99
 
00:22:56.810 --> 00:22:56.820 align:start position:0%
and 100. so moved it's been moved by
 
00:22:57.890 --> 00:22:57.900 align:start position:0%
representative Leon seconded by
 
00:22:59.570 --> 00:22:59.580 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt any further
 
00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:00.590 align:start position:0%

the rules and the needed rules have been
 
00:23:10.490 --> 00:23:10.500 align:start position:0%
waived for timeline
 
00:23:12.649 --> 00:23:12.659 align:start position:0%
next up is the board of licensed
 
00:23:16.850 --> 00:23:16.860 align:start position:0%
dietitians item number 22 131 yes sir
 
00:23:19.250 --> 00:23:19.260 align:start position:0%
there's just one um comment to bring to
 
00:23:22.310 --> 00:23:22.320 align:start position:0%
your attention and that's on page one of
 
00:23:24.830 --> 00:23:24.840 align:start position:0%
the conditional approval request or page
 
00:23:26.930 --> 00:23:26.940 align:start position:0%
two of the linked PDF depending on which
 
00:23:29.210 --> 00:23:29.220 align:start position:0%
one you're looking at like I said um the
 
00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
agency did file a conditional approval
 
00:23:33.710 --> 00:23:33.720 align:start position:0%
request the comment although I've
 
00:23:35.630 --> 00:23:35.640 align:start position:0%
indicated it's an unclear comment it
 
00:23:37.970 --> 00:23:37.980 align:start position:0%
really should be a informational note to
 
00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:39.440 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
the legislature has been working to
 
00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
remove fee Authority from the boards and
 
00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:48.240 align:start position:0%
to place that fee Authority with the
 
00:23:51.289 --> 00:23:51.299 align:start position:0%
executive director of the oplc and here
 
00:23:52.730 --> 00:23:52.740 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to make sure that the
 
00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:54.720 align:start position:0%
committee was aware even though there is
 
00:23:57.370 --> 00:23:57.380 align:start position:0%
a reference here to a renewal fee
 
00:24:02.029 --> 00:24:02.039 align:start position:0%
by in another rule that the fees the fee
 
00:24:03.529 --> 00:24:03.539 align:start position:0%
Authority doesn't line with the board it
 
00:24:05.890 --> 00:24:05.900 align:start position:0%
is in fact with the executive director
 
00:24:09.169 --> 00:24:09.179 align:start position:0%
this board does have fine Authority but
 
00:24:12.289 --> 00:24:12.299 align:start position:0%
not fee Authority again and this is the
 
00:24:14.090 --> 00:24:14.100 align:start position:0%
only comment and it is an informational
 
00:24:16.430 --> 00:24:16.440 align:start position:0%
comment to the committee
 
00:24:18.890 --> 00:24:18.900 align:start position:0%
before I go to the agency if in case
 
00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:20.760 align:start position:0%
somebody has questions I'll let you know
 
00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
that I served on SB 330's study
 
00:24:25.669 --> 00:24:25.679 align:start position:0%
committee which is about oplc licensure
 
00:24:27.289 --> 00:24:27.299 align:start position:0%
and process
 
00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:29.880 align:start position:0%
um I do have a bill in to do cleanup we
 
00:24:32.090 --> 00:24:32.100 align:start position:0%
have at one point we granted oplc
 
00:24:35.029 --> 00:24:35.039 align:start position:0%
director the right to set fees
 
00:24:37.090 --> 00:24:37.100 align:start position:0%
but we also have throughout the statute
 
00:24:39.409 --> 00:24:39.419 align:start position:0%
statutes on all these different boards
 
00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
places where the board also has
 
00:24:43.669 --> 00:24:43.679 align:start position:0%
authority to set fees we have in two
 
00:24:45.970 --> 00:24:45.980 align:start position:0%
different places I do have a LSR
 
00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:48.480 align:start position:0%
submitted to clean up all that language
 
00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:50.520 align:start position:0%
and go along with the most current law
 
00:24:53.750 --> 00:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
we passed which was to move fee setting
 
00:24:55.730 --> 00:24:55.740 align:start position:0%
Authority into oplc directly not the
 
00:24:57.770 --> 00:24:57.780 align:start position:0%
board and the board is advisory in
 
00:24:59.510 --> 00:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
nature and when it comes to fee setting
 
00:25:02.090 --> 00:25:02.100 align:start position:0%
so there is legislative there is an LSR
 
00:25:04.730 --> 00:25:04.740 align:start position:0%
presented based on Senate Bill 330 study
 
00:25:07.310 --> 00:25:07.320 align:start position:0%
commission so that being said this will
 
00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:10.320 align:start position:0%
be corrected in the law so Mr chairman I
 
00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:12.240 align:start position:0%
think the members of the gel car should
 
00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
be co-sponsors of that of your LSR so
 
00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:17.880 align:start position:0%
it's clear that it's something that gel
 
00:25:20.210 --> 00:25:20.220 align:start position:0%
car supports sure I'll make sure I had
 
00:25:21.649 --> 00:25:21.659 align:start position:0%
that I haven't got language yet once I
 
00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:22.740 align:start position:0%
get it because I'm sure it's going to be
 
00:25:24.649 --> 00:25:24.659 align:start position:0%
very extensive considering the number of
 
00:25:26.450 --> 00:25:26.460 align:start position:0%
places we talk about boards and fees and
 
00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:27.890 align:start position:0%
places we talk about boards and fees and
oplc

00:25:27.890 --> 00:25:27.900 align:start position:0%
oplc
 
00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:30.960 align:start position:0%
so uh any further discussion or
 
00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:32.870 align:start position:0%
so uh any further discussion or
questions

00:25:32.870 --> 00:25:32.880 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:25:34.909 --> 00:25:34.919 align:start position:0%
seeing not an antenna motion or approve
 
00:25:38.930 --> 00:25:38.940 align:start position:0%
the rule 22 131 so moved
 
00:25:41.390 --> 00:25:41.400 align:start position:0%
it's been moved to approve is there a
 
00:25:44.149 --> 00:25:44.159 align:start position:0%
second second by representative Lynn uh
 
00:25:47.149 --> 00:25:47.159 align:start position:0%
motion by representative Schmidt
 
00:25:49.490 --> 00:25:49.500 align:start position:0%
any further discussion
 
00:25:51.289 --> 00:25:51.299 align:start position:0%
seeing none all those in favor say aye
 
00:25:53.570 --> 00:25:53.580 align:start position:0%
aye opposed name
 
00:25:57.110 --> 00:25:57.120 align:start position:0%
eyes have it and uh the rule is adopted
 
00:26:01.490 --> 00:26:01.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:03.289 --> 00:26:03.299 align:start position:0%
all right the next one is
 
00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:07.080 align:start position:0%
um border psychologist 22 149 and this
 
00:26:08.330 --> 00:26:08.340 align:start position:0%
one is just an incorporation by
 
00:26:10.250 --> 00:26:10.260 align:start position:0%
reference statement issue because
 
00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:12.240 align:start position:0%
there's a new
 
00:26:14.990 --> 00:26:15.000 align:start position:0%
um ethics principle document that there
 
00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
that has come out in 2016.
 
00:26:20.210 --> 00:26:20.220 align:start position:0%
um the agency decided that they they
 
00:26:22.010 --> 00:26:22.020 align:start position:0%
want to go ahead and and go back to the
 
00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
board and get that that document and
 
00:26:27.049 --> 00:26:27.059 align:start position:0%
update that that date and so they're
 
00:26:28.909 --> 00:26:28.919 align:start position:0%
asking for
 
00:26:31.070 --> 00:26:31.080 align:start position:0%
um a postponement and gel car will have
 
00:26:33.049 --> 00:26:33.059 align:start position:0%
to waive their deadline and then they
 
00:26:34.370 --> 00:26:34.380 align:start position:0%
can come back around in January and
 
00:26:36.169 --> 00:26:36.179 align:start position:0%
that'll be all fixed thank you so I'd
 
00:26:37.970 --> 00:26:37.980 align:start position:0%
entertain a motion to postpone and wave
 
00:26:39.769 --> 00:26:39.779 align:start position:0%
timeline requirements
 
00:26:41.990 --> 00:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
so moved it's been moved by
 
00:26:43.310 --> 00:26:43.320 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt second by
 
00:26:46.130 --> 00:26:46.140 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn to uh postpone and
 
00:26:48.950 --> 00:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
wave timeline requirements on rule uh
 
00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:50.690 align:start position:0%
wave timeline requirements on rule uh
22-149

00:26:50.690 --> 00:26:50.700 align:start position:0%
22-149
 
00:26:53.210 --> 00:26:53.220 align:start position:0%
any further discussion seeing none all
 
00:26:56.269 --> 00:26:56.279 align:start position:0%
those in favor say aye aye opposed name
 
00:26:58.970 --> 00:26:58.980 align:start position:0%
eyes have it and it's been postponed and
 
00:27:00.470 --> 00:27:00.480 align:start position:0%

00:27:08.279 --> 00:27:09.470 align:start position:0%
obligations okay this one is a little
confusing

00:27:09.470 --> 00:27:09.480 align:start position:0%
confusing
 
00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
um so there's nothing wrong with the
 
00:27:14.510 --> 00:27:14.520 align:start position:0%
rule I have no comments on the rule the
 
00:27:18.710 --> 00:27:18.720 align:start position:0%
issue was that back when the
 
00:27:21.470 --> 00:27:21.480 align:start position:0%
um agency filed their notice to go in
 
00:27:23.390 --> 00:27:23.400 align:start position:0%
the register
 
00:27:27.529 --> 00:27:27.539 align:start position:0%
um there was a mix-up in the FIS so the
 
00:27:30.769 --> 00:27:30.779 align:start position:0%
FIS that was published went to a
 
00:27:32.330 --> 00:27:32.340 align:start position:0%
completely different Rule and said
 
00:27:34.490 --> 00:27:34.500 align:start position:0%
completely different things and we
 
00:27:36.890 --> 00:27:36.900 align:start position:0%
realized it and I'm not sure what
 
00:27:38.769 --> 00:27:38.779 align:start position:0%
happened with the communication between
 
00:27:43.370 --> 00:27:43.380 align:start position:0%
myself and the agency but um for some
 
00:27:45.049 --> 00:27:45.059 align:start position:0%
reason we didn't get it fixed right at
 
00:27:47.390 --> 00:27:47.400 align:start position:0%
the beginning and so it went out like
 
00:27:51.049 --> 00:27:51.059 align:start position:0%
that and then we um it was it was
 
00:27:53.029 --> 00:27:53.039 align:start position:0%
obvious that it was a mistake and that
 
00:27:54.529 --> 00:27:54.539 align:start position:0%
you know just the wrong one had been
 
00:27:56.870 --> 00:27:56.880 align:start position:0%
filed and so we asked for the correct
 
00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:57.769 align:start position:0%
filed and so we asked for the correct
one

00:27:57.769 --> 00:27:57.779 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:27:59.510 --> 00:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
um we were immediately given the correct
 
00:28:01.850 --> 00:28:01.860 align:start position:0%
one which is what you see here in the
 
00:28:03.649 --> 00:28:03.659 align:start position:0%
meeting packet
 
00:28:05.690 --> 00:28:05.700 align:start position:0%
um but it is a different FIS so there's
 
00:28:08.149 --> 00:28:08.159 align:start position:0%
a question of whether there was full
 
00:28:08.159 --> 00:28:09.470 align:start position:0%
a question of whether there was full
notice

00:28:09.470 --> 00:28:09.480 align:start position:0%
notice
 
00:28:11.210 --> 00:28:11.220 align:start position:0%
for when this went to the the public
 
00:28:14.390 --> 00:28:14.400 align:start position:0%
originally so you have some options you
 
00:28:16.370 --> 00:28:16.380 align:start position:0%
can either just approve it and move on
 
00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:17.990 align:start position:0%
can either just approve it and move on
or

00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:20.640 align:start position:0%
um you can kind of a little outside of
 
00:28:23.810 --> 00:28:23.820 align:start position:0%
541 but a but you could request that the
 
00:28:26.269 --> 00:28:26.279 align:start position:0%
agency have another hearing another
 
00:28:28.250 --> 00:28:28.260 align:start position:0%
public hearing so that we would notice
 
00:28:30.769 --> 00:28:30.779 align:start position:0%
them with the correct FIS they would
 
00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:32.220 align:start position:0%
have another public hearing and then
 
00:28:34.610 --> 00:28:34.620 align:start position:0%
they would come back for approval
 
00:28:36.350 --> 00:28:36.360 align:start position:0%
um if this has happened
 
00:28:38.870 --> 00:28:38.880 align:start position:0%
I've seen it happen once with an agency
 
00:28:40.909 --> 00:28:40.919 align:start position:0%
that had a lot of people come to a
 
00:28:42.590 --> 00:28:42.600 align:start position:0%
public hearing and some people didn't
 
00:28:44.630 --> 00:28:44.640 align:start position:0%
feel like they had gotten enough time to
 
00:28:46.430 --> 00:28:46.440 align:start position:0%
to say what they wanted to say at the
 
00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:47.510 align:start position:0%
to say what they wanted to say at the
hearing

00:28:47.510 --> 00:28:47.520 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
00:28:49.250 --> 00:28:49.260 align:start position:0%
um and that was I believe it was Des or
 
00:28:50.390 --> 00:28:50.400 align:start position:0%
fish and game
 
00:28:53.330 --> 00:28:53.340 align:start position:0%
um and so they went back after the jail
 
00:28:55.610 --> 00:28:55.620 align:start position:0%
car meeting had another hearing and then
 
00:28:57.289 --> 00:28:57.299 align:start position:0%
came back to jailcar for approval after
 
00:28:59.149 --> 00:28:59.159 align:start position:0%
they had done that
 
00:28:59.159 --> 00:29:00.350 align:start position:0%
they had done that
um

00:29:00.350 --> 00:29:00.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:03.289 --> 00:29:03.299 align:start position:0%
it's really up to the the committee tell
 
00:29:06.049 --> 00:29:06.059 align:start position:0%
you more thank you Mr Vice chairman
 
00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:08.760 align:start position:0%
um I've spoken extensively with Tina
 
00:29:10.570 --> 00:29:10.580 align:start position:0%
Kelly about this
 
00:29:13.730 --> 00:29:13.740 align:start position:0%
the initial fiscal impact statement that
 
00:29:16.190 --> 00:29:16.200 align:start position:0%
was included was from a rule earlier
 
00:29:18.889 --> 00:29:18.899 align:start position:0%
this year by the same board that
 
00:29:21.830 --> 00:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
indicated there was an indeterminable
 
00:29:24.230 --> 00:29:24.240 align:start position:0%
but minor uh
 
00:29:30.649 --> 00:29:30.659 align:start position:0%
cost to the state but otherwise that was
 
00:29:34.130 --> 00:29:34.140 align:start position:0%
it the actual the correct FIS indicates
 
00:29:36.409 --> 00:29:36.419 align:start position:0%
no cost at all which is the case with
 
00:29:37.930 --> 00:29:37.940 align:start position:0%
the rules
 
00:29:41.090 --> 00:29:41.100 align:start position:0%
Tina also indicated that no one showed
 
00:29:44.450 --> 00:29:44.460 align:start position:0%
at the public hearing no one supplied
 
00:29:47.149 --> 00:29:47.159 align:start position:0%
written comment so it did not appear
 
00:29:50.690 --> 00:29:50.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:54.470 --> 00:29:54.480 align:start position:0%
misled or harmed by this as Christina
 
00:29:57.310 --> 00:29:57.320 align:start position:0%
said you can approve the rule
 
00:29:59.870 --> 00:29:59.880 align:start position:0%
you could
 
00:30:01.490 --> 00:30:01.500 align:start position:0%
requests they have another public
 
00:30:04.010 --> 00:30:04.020 align:start position:0%
hearing or you could request that they
 
00:30:06.289 --> 00:30:06.299 align:start position:0%
put special notice in the rule making
 
00:30:09.110 --> 00:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
register uh to indicate what happened
 
00:30:13.310 --> 00:30:13.320 align:start position:0%
and include a copy of the correct FIS
 
00:30:17.090 --> 00:30:17.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:19.430 --> 00:30:19.440 align:start position:0%
or senator
 
00:30:22.010 --> 00:30:22.020 align:start position:0%
uh it seems to me the the latter might
 
00:30:24.590 --> 00:30:24.600 align:start position:0%
make sense as a middle ground so putting
 
00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:26.760 align:start position:0%
the correction in the rather than
 
00:30:28.430 --> 00:30:28.440 align:start position:0%
holding a whole new
 
00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:30.720 align:start position:0%
hearing to just put that change in the
 
00:30:32.570 --> 00:30:32.580 align:start position:0%
register I think it makes a lot of sense
 
00:30:34.909 --> 00:30:34.919 align:start position:0%
I agree with Senator Whitney entirely so
 
00:30:37.070 --> 00:30:37.080 align:start position:0%
is that a motion senator
 
00:30:40.370 --> 00:30:40.380 align:start position:0%
it's been moved to approve the rule and
 
00:30:42.529 --> 00:30:42.539 align:start position:0%
to make a note in the register that the
 
00:30:45.049 --> 00:30:45.059 align:start position:0%
incorrect FIS and posted corrected FIS
 
00:30:47.269 --> 00:30:47.279 align:start position:0%
in the register is there a second to
 
00:30:50.450 --> 00:30:50.460 align:start position:0%
that it's been seconded by uh uh
 
00:30:52.970 --> 00:30:52.980 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn any further
 
00:30:52.980 --> 00:30:55.010 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn any further
discussion

00:30:55.010 --> 00:30:55.020 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
00:30:56.870 --> 00:30:56.880 align:start position:0%
seeing none all those in favor say aye
 
00:30:58.909 --> 00:30:58.919 align:start position:0%
aye opposed name
 
00:31:04.010 --> 00:31:04.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:05.990 --> 00:31:06.000 align:start position:0%
you guys are getting all the interesting
 
00:31:08.149 --> 00:31:08.159 align:start position:0%
rules right so you're getting every type
 
00:31:11.330 --> 00:31:11.340 align:start position:0%
final conditional interim so next up is
 
00:31:13.190 --> 00:31:13.200 align:start position:0%
an emergency Rule and Mike can you just
 
00:31:15.049 --> 00:31:15.059 align:start position:0%
let the uh again the new members explain
 
00:31:17.510 --> 00:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
what emergency rule what what this means
 
00:31:19.310 --> 00:31:19.320 align:start position:0%
to the uh board
 
00:31:22.669 --> 00:31:22.679 align:start position:0%
certainly an emergency rule is allowed
 
00:31:25.370 --> 00:31:25.380 align:start position:0%
for two reasons there's imminent Peril
 
00:31:27.830 --> 00:31:27.840 align:start position:0%
to Public Health or safety or there's
 
00:31:30.110 --> 00:31:30.120 align:start position:0%
going to be a substantial economic cost
 
00:31:33.230 --> 00:31:33.240 align:start position:0%
to the state or citizens if the rule
 
00:31:36.830 --> 00:31:36.840 align:start position:0%
because there is not time for regular
 
00:31:39.049 --> 00:31:39.059 align:start position:0%
rule making to address the important
 
00:31:42.529 --> 00:31:42.539 align:start position:0%
issue an example would be if there's an
 
00:31:46.250 --> 00:31:46.260 align:start position:0%
outbreak of red tide then an agency
 
00:31:50.149 --> 00:31:50.159 align:start position:0%
would do an emergency rule to a you know
 
00:31:54.950 --> 00:31:54.960 align:start position:0%
stop clamming in other shellfish
 
00:32:00.649 --> 00:32:00.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:02.810 --> 00:32:02.820 align:start position:0%
staff finds that there does not appear
 
00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
to be
 
00:32:06.409 --> 00:32:06.419 align:start position:0%
an emergency and we tell that to the
 
00:32:06.419 --> 00:32:07.630 align:start position:0%
an emergency and we tell that to the
committee

00:32:07.630 --> 00:32:07.640 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:32:11.049 --> 00:32:11.059 align:start position:0%
an emergency rule is unusual in that
 
00:32:14.450 --> 00:32:14.460 align:start position:0%
once they the agency writes it and
 
00:32:16.370 --> 00:32:16.380 align:start position:0%
brings it to our office it is
 
00:32:18.769 --> 00:32:18.779 align:start position:0%
immediately effective there is no public
 
00:32:22.549 --> 00:32:22.559 align:start position:0%
hearing there is no other notice we do
 
00:32:25.610 --> 00:32:25.620 align:start position:0%
publish it in the rule bank and register
 
00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:26.510 align:start position:0%
publish it in the rule bank and register
um

00:32:26.510 --> 00:32:26.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:30.110 --> 00:32:30.120 align:start position:0%
in this instance I I would prefer that
 
00:32:33.289 --> 00:32:33.299 align:start position:0%
the agency talk about the substance of
 
00:32:37.070 --> 00:32:37.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:39.350 --> 00:32:39.360 align:start position:0%
thank you so just some board members
 
00:32:41.029 --> 00:32:41.039 align:start position:0%
understand we actually don't have a vote
 
00:32:43.490 --> 00:32:43.500 align:start position:0%
on this right so the reality is it's
 
00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
informational only they have the right
 
00:32:47.269 --> 00:32:47.279 align:start position:0%
to make the emergency rule based on 541a
 
00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:49.200 align:start position:0%
the only thing we could talk about is
 
00:32:51.289 --> 00:32:51.299 align:start position:0%
potentially the fact whether we think
 
00:32:53.810 --> 00:32:53.820 align:start position:0%
that the emergency truly exists or not
 
00:32:56.930 --> 00:32:56.940 align:start position:0%
and and comment right if the committee
 
00:33:00.409 --> 00:33:00.419 align:start position:0%
believes that there is no emergency or
 
00:33:02.870 --> 00:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
that there may be an issue but it would
 
00:33:04.490 --> 00:33:04.500 align:start position:0%
be better suited to regular rulemaking
 
00:33:07.310 --> 00:33:07.320 align:start position:0%
then you can petition the agency
 
00:33:13.130 --> 00:33:13.140 align:start position:0%
pursuant to 541a4 to repeal the rule oh
 
00:33:13.140 --> 00:33:15.649 align:start position:0%
pursuant to 541a4 to repeal the rule oh
God

00:33:15.649 --> 00:33:15.659 align:start position:0%
God
 
00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:18.240 align:start position:0%
uh good morning Vice chair members of
 
00:33:20.269 --> 00:33:20.279 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is Allison radmay
 
00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
I am the administrator of the
 
00:33:23.330 --> 00:33:23.340 align:start position:0%
administrative rules unit for the
 
00:33:24.909 --> 00:33:24.919 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
00:33:28.130 --> 00:33:28.140 align:start position:0%
and with me I have my name is Beth
 
00:33:30.769 --> 00:33:30.779 align:start position:0%
margeson and I'm the general counsel and
 
00:33:32.930 --> 00:33:32.940 align:start position:0%
legislative liaison for the division for
 
00:33:34.610 --> 00:33:34.620 align:start position:0%
children youth and Families
 
00:33:37.490 --> 00:33:37.500 align:start position:0%
and we also have with us Steve Allen who
 
00:33:39.649 --> 00:33:39.659 align:start position:0%
is the head of the policy unit whose
 
00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:48.889 --> 00:33:48.899 align:start position:0%
uh yes so um I'm actually probably going
 
00:33:50.149 --> 00:33:50.159 align:start position:0%
to defer
 
00:33:52.789 --> 00:33:52.799 align:start position:0%
um a lot to uh Eve because she has the
 
00:33:55.370 --> 00:33:55.380 align:start position:0%
subject vendor expertise on this however
 
00:33:57.169 --> 00:33:57.179 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:33:57.179 --> 00:33:57.850 align:start position:0%
the um
the

00:33:57.850 --> 00:33:57.860 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:34:01.250 --> 00:34:01.260 align:start position:0%
rule is needed because the
 
00:34:01.260 --> 00:34:02.269 align:start position:0%
rule is needed because the
um

00:34:02.269 --> 00:34:02.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:04.669 --> 00:34:04.679 align:start position:0%
we are
 
00:34:09.710 --> 00:34:09.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:09.720 --> 00:34:12.169 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:34:12.169 --> 00:34:12.179 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:34:14.810 --> 00:34:14.820 align:start position:0%
um so the right now the New Hampshire
 
00:34:16.790 --> 00:34:16.800 align:start position:0%
Foster families are not required to
 
00:34:19.609 --> 00:34:19.619 align:start position:0%
receive the covid-19 vaccine in order to
 
00:34:21.589 --> 00:34:21.599 align:start position:0%
be licensed and the reason that we are
 
00:34:23.089 --> 00:34:23.099 align:start position:0%
doing this is at the division of Public
 
00:34:25.609 --> 00:34:25.619 align:start position:0%
Health has not mandated covet vaccines
 
00:34:28.250 --> 00:34:28.260 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire and also
 
00:34:30.349 --> 00:34:30.359 align:start position:0%
it's it's necessary for us to retain our
 
00:34:32.210 --> 00:34:32.220 align:start position:0%
foster families
 
00:34:34.430 --> 00:34:34.440 align:start position:0%
um and uh the Department's immunization
 
00:34:36.169 --> 00:34:36.179 align:start position:0%
requirements for children in foster care
 
00:34:37.970 --> 00:34:37.980 align:start position:0%
have typically aligned with the federal
 
00:34:39.409 --> 00:34:39.419 align:start position:0%
licensing standards for the United
 
00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:40.800 align:start position:0%
States Department of Health and Human
 
00:34:43.730 --> 00:34:43.740 align:start position:0%
Services following guidance from the uh
 
00:34:46.669 --> 00:34:46.679 align:start position:0%
Centers for Disease Control so the CDC
 
00:34:49.010 --> 00:34:49.020 align:start position:0%
recently updated its list of recommended
 
00:34:51.109 --> 00:34:51.119 align:start position:0%
immunizations to include the covid-19
 
00:34:54.050 --> 00:34:54.060 align:start position:0%
vaccine uh when we as a department
 
00:34:56.450 --> 00:34:56.460 align:start position:0%
learned of this change we moved swiftly
 
00:34:58.130 --> 00:34:58.140 align:start position:0%
to amend our administrative rules to
 
00:35:00.170 --> 00:35:00.180 align:start position:0%
ensure that the covid-19 vaccine would
 
00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:01.680 align:start position:0%
not be required for foster care
 
00:35:03.890 --> 00:35:03.900 align:start position:0%
licensing and
 
00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:04.970 align:start position:0%
licensing and
um

00:35:04.970 --> 00:35:04.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:08.870 --> 00:35:08.880 align:start position:0%
so the uh in order for our
 
00:35:11.150 --> 00:35:11.160 align:start position:0%
you know at this point our
 
00:35:13.010 --> 00:35:13.020 align:start position:0%
administrative rules are not in
 
00:35:15.770 --> 00:35:15.780 align:start position:0%
alignment so we need to do this carve
 
00:35:19.190 --> 00:35:19.200 align:start position:0%
out to ensure that we are in in
 
00:35:21.410 --> 00:35:21.420 align:start position:0%
alignment with the rest of the rules
 
00:35:23.990 --> 00:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
um and so we are doing this on an
 
00:35:25.550 --> 00:35:25.560 align:start position:0%
emergency basis
 
00:35:28.790 --> 00:35:28.800 align:start position:0%
um at this time and then uh when the
 
00:35:30.829 --> 00:35:30.839 align:start position:0%
rule is we intend to make the rule
 
00:35:33.349 --> 00:35:33.359 align:start position:0%
permanent I guess in June when we open
 
00:35:35.150 --> 00:35:35.160 align:start position:0%
up the rule for
 
00:35:38.030 --> 00:35:38.040 align:start position:0%
um for further revisions
 
00:35:40.430 --> 00:35:40.440 align:start position:0%
so um these changes will be put into
 
00:35:42.410 --> 00:35:42.420 align:start position:0%
place permanently prior to the
 
00:35:43.910 --> 00:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
expiration of the rule and internally
 
00:35:45.829 --> 00:35:45.839 align:start position:0%
the department is working on that draft
 
00:35:47.870 --> 00:35:47.880 align:start position:0%
to start getting that filed
 
00:35:50.450 --> 00:35:50.460 align:start position:0%
and I would just ask Eve because I'm new
 
00:35:52.370 --> 00:35:52.380 align:start position:0%
to this if there's anything that she
 
00:36:01.310 --> 00:36:01.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:04.250 --> 00:36:04.260 align:start position:0%
I think you spoke to the situation very
 
00:36:07.430 --> 00:36:07.440 align:start position:0%
well we are licensing standards follow
 
00:36:09.890 --> 00:36:09.900 align:start position:0%
the federal requirements and they issued
 
00:36:11.990 --> 00:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
new federal requirements in 2019 maybe
 
00:36:13.849 --> 00:36:13.859 align:start position:0%
before covid
 
00:36:16.790 --> 00:36:16.800 align:start position:0%
was here and those requirements required
 
00:36:19.550 --> 00:36:19.560 align:start position:0%
immunizations to be present for
 
00:36:21.470 --> 00:36:21.480 align:start position:0%
household members
 
00:36:23.990 --> 00:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
that came out in February 2019 then we
 
00:36:25.910 --> 00:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
had covet in 2020 the rule became
 
00:36:27.589 --> 00:36:27.599 align:start position:0%
effective in 2020 but that was still
 
00:36:29.990 --> 00:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
prior to the vaccine existence
 
00:36:32.870 --> 00:36:32.880 align:start position:0%
since then the entities that are named
 
00:36:34.609 --> 00:36:34.619 align:start position:0%
the federal standards for vaccine
 
00:36:36.530 --> 00:36:36.540 align:start position:0%
requirements have amended one of the
 
00:36:38.690 --> 00:36:38.700 align:start position:0%
three entities amended their vaccines to
 
00:36:41.150 --> 00:36:41.160 align:start position:0%
include the vaccine to prevent covet and
 
00:36:42.290 --> 00:36:42.300 align:start position:0%
we're trying to make sure that that
 
00:36:45.890 --> 00:36:45.900 align:start position:0%
change that was not included in 2020
 
00:36:47.630 --> 00:36:47.640 align:start position:0%
that has now become effective does not
 
00:36:49.790 --> 00:36:49.800 align:start position:0%
impact our foster families so we're
 
00:36:51.170 --> 00:36:51.180 align:start position:0%
trying to be proactive to make sure that
 
00:36:54.109 --> 00:36:54.119 align:start position:0%
our rules that require vaccines to be in
 
00:36:55.609 --> 00:36:55.619 align:start position:0%
a men are in alignment with those two
 
00:36:57.829 --> 00:36:57.839 align:start position:0%
entities have this exceptions we're not
 
00:36:59.690 --> 00:36:59.700 align:start position:0%
requiring families inadvertently to have
 
00:37:01.190 --> 00:37:01.200 align:start position:0%
to have a covered vaccine and that's not
 
00:37:04.609 --> 00:37:04.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:06.230 --> 00:37:06.240 align:start position:0%
all right let me see if I can take all
 
00:37:07.670 --> 00:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
of that and summarize it and something
 
00:37:09.770 --> 00:37:09.780 align:start position:0%
that we can all understand so the short
 
00:37:11.930 --> 00:37:11.940 align:start position:0%
version is the federal government could
 
00:37:14.390 --> 00:37:14.400 align:start position:0%
change their rules to require covid I
 
00:37:16.250 --> 00:37:16.260 align:start position:0%
know that we have a law because I I
 
00:37:18.470 --> 00:37:18.480 align:start position:0%
wrote it that says that you can't
 
00:37:21.109 --> 00:37:21.119 align:start position:0%
require the coveted vaccine for for uh
 
00:37:23.210 --> 00:37:23.220 align:start position:0%
participation in certain things and so
 
00:37:24.770 --> 00:37:24.780 align:start position:0%
what we're doing is creating this carve
 
00:37:25.790 --> 00:37:25.800 align:start position:0%
out because even though the federal
 
00:37:27.349 --> 00:37:27.359 align:start position:0%
standard says you have to have it we're
 
00:37:28.730 --> 00:37:28.740 align:start position:0%
saying the state standard is that you
 
00:37:31.069 --> 00:37:31.079 align:start position:0%
don't and that's what this rule does
 
00:37:35.210 --> 00:37:35.220 align:start position:0%
correct and um so we again we took this
 
00:37:36.650 --> 00:37:36.660 align:start position:0%
original rule
 
00:37:39.470 --> 00:37:39.480 align:start position:0%
um in June of 2020 so I actually made
 
00:37:41.210 --> 00:37:41.220 align:start position:0%
2020. so I think it was the first gel
 
00:37:43.970 --> 00:37:43.980 align:start position:0%
car uh back since covet started and at
 
00:37:44.930 --> 00:37:44.940 align:start position:0%
that time
 
00:37:47.210 --> 00:37:47.220 align:start position:0%
um there were comments and questions on
 
00:37:50.089 --> 00:37:50.099 align:start position:0%
what if there becomes or there is a
 
00:37:52.250 --> 00:37:52.260 align:start position:0%
vaccine for covid uh how do we address
 
00:37:55.010 --> 00:37:55.020 align:start position:0%
that and we did tell the committee at
 
00:37:57.109 --> 00:37:57.119 align:start position:0%
that time that we would enter rulemaking
 
00:38:00.410 --> 00:38:00.420 align:start position:0%
immediately uh to exempt the Foster
 
00:38:02.630 --> 00:38:02.640 align:start position:0%
families from that requirement so we
 
00:38:04.870 --> 00:38:04.880 align:start position:0%
tried to make thank you
 
00:38:07.370 --> 00:38:07.380 align:start position:0%
discussion representative Whitley
 
00:38:09.910 --> 00:38:09.920 align:start position:0%
Senator Whitley sorry
 
00:38:13.190 --> 00:38:13.200 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr Mr Vice chair thanks for
 
00:38:14.690 --> 00:38:14.700 align:start position:0%
taking my question so I'm just trying to
 
00:38:16.130 --> 00:38:16.140 align:start position:0%
think through
 
00:38:18.470 --> 00:38:18.480 align:start position:0%
have you spoken to whoever you need to
 
00:38:20.210 --> 00:38:20.220 align:start position:0%
speak with at the federal government to
 
00:38:22.670 --> 00:38:22.680 align:start position:0%
make sure we're not dinged on anything
 
00:38:24.109 --> 00:38:24.119 align:start position:0%
I have reached out to representative
 
00:38:25.550 --> 00:38:25.560 align:start position:0%
with the Children's Bureau to make sure
 
00:38:27.130 --> 00:38:27.140 align:start position:0%
they're aware that we're making this
 
00:38:29.450 --> 00:38:29.460 align:start position:0%
deviation from the model standards to
 
00:38:31.730 --> 00:38:31.740 align:start position:0%
have an exception they were aware and
 
00:38:33.770 --> 00:38:33.780 align:start position:0%
they said that we can hold on putting
 
00:38:35.810 --> 00:38:35.820 align:start position:0%
our official for we plan amendment in
 
00:38:38.270 --> 00:38:38.280 align:start position:0%
until the official Wiccan goes in but
 
00:38:39.950 --> 00:38:39.960 align:start position:0%
they were agreeable to us making this
 
00:38:41.990 --> 00:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
accept as long as we can validate the
 
00:38:43.670 --> 00:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
reason behind it and that is the concern
 
00:38:45.410 --> 00:38:45.420 align:start position:0%
about the impact on families and loss of
 
00:38:46.910 --> 00:38:46.920 align:start position:0%
foster homes
 
00:39:01.329 --> 00:39:01.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:06.290 --> 00:39:06.300 align:start position:0%
19 or is it a vaccine or is it required
 
00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:07.010 align:start position:0%
19 or is it a vaccine or is it required
um

00:39:07.010 --> 00:39:07.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:09.430 --> 00:39:09.440 align:start position:0%
the language says
 
00:39:12.170 --> 00:39:12.180 align:start position:0%
the national model licensing standards
 
00:39:13.970 --> 00:39:13.980 align:start position:0%
and the national model licensing
 
00:39:15.470 --> 00:39:15.480 align:start position:0%
standards says that household members
 
00:39:17.510 --> 00:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
will be in compliance with all
 
00:39:20.270 --> 00:39:20.280 align:start position:0%
recommended vaccinations so it's that
 
00:39:22.069 --> 00:39:22.079 align:start position:0%
Dance of the language where they're
 
00:39:23.270 --> 00:39:23.280 align:start position:0%
requiring you to meet all
 
00:39:25.130 --> 00:39:25.140 align:start position:0%
recommendations so it's
 
00:39:27.410 --> 00:39:27.420 align:start position:0%
both terms unfortunately are part of the
 
00:39:33.010 --> 00:39:33.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:34.790 --> 00:39:34.800 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I understand what you're
 
00:39:37.790 --> 00:39:37.800 align:start position:0%
saying I guess my only question then is
 
00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:39.170 align:start position:0%
saying I guess my only question then is
our

00:39:39.170 --> 00:39:39.180 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:39:41.750 --> 00:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
you seem to be okay with
 
00:39:45.050 --> 00:39:45.060 align:start position:0%
having a state rule
 
00:39:49.609 --> 00:39:49.619 align:start position:0%
that is in conflict with the Federal
 
00:39:51.829 --> 00:39:51.839 align:start position:0%
rule as you've interpreted and I guess
 
00:39:54.230 --> 00:39:54.240 align:start position:0%
my question is is that okay or you know
 
00:39:56.150 --> 00:39:56.160 align:start position:0%
are we likely to have the feds come in
 
00:39:58.970 --> 00:39:58.980 align:start position:0%
and say you're in violation of
 
00:40:00.950 --> 00:40:00.960 align:start position:0%
and and therefore you lose some funding
 
00:40:03.829 --> 00:40:03.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:05.930 --> 00:40:05.940 align:start position:0%
you plan with our federal Partners our
 
00:40:10.670 --> 00:40:10.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:12.230 --> 00:40:12.240 align:start position:0%
telephone model foster care licensing
 
00:40:14.270 --> 00:40:14.280 align:start position:0%
standards that allows us to articulate
 
00:40:16.670 --> 00:40:16.680 align:start position:0%
any deviations from the standards and as
 
00:40:19.069 --> 00:40:19.079 align:start position:0%
long as we can give a valid reason as to
 
00:40:21.349 --> 00:40:21.359 align:start position:0%
what reason we have to deviate that's
 
00:40:23.030 --> 00:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
not putting any safety concern for
 
00:40:25.250 --> 00:40:25.260 align:start position:0%
children or families then the feds will
 
00:40:27.050 --> 00:40:27.060 align:start position:0%
review that and they'll sign off on it
 
00:40:29.510 --> 00:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
and until they um if they when we put
 
00:40:31.910 --> 00:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
the page in and they review it if they
 
00:40:34.069 --> 00:40:34.079 align:start position:0%
decline it then becomes the compliance
 
00:40:35.450 --> 00:40:35.460 align:start position:0%
issue that they've told us we're not in
 
00:40:37.670 --> 00:40:37.680 align:start position:0%
compliance that we need to rectify it at
 
00:40:38.630 --> 00:40:38.640 align:start position:0%
this point in time we've been
 
00:40:39.950 --> 00:40:39.960 align:start position:0%
transparent with them that we're looking
 
00:40:41.690 --> 00:40:41.700 align:start position:0%
at this deviation and they have not
 
00:40:43.550 --> 00:40:43.560 align:start position:0%
expressed any concerns for us being out
 
00:40:45.530 --> 00:40:45.540 align:start position:0%
of compliance
 
00:40:48.349 --> 00:40:48.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:49.910 --> 00:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn also says hey this
 
00:40:51.109 --> 00:40:51.119 align:start position:0%
is similar to what we do at Medicaid
 
00:40:52.730 --> 00:40:52.740 align:start position:0%
expansion right we have some exemptions
 
00:40:54.290 --> 00:40:54.300 align:start position:0%
and differences in Medicaid expansion
 
00:40:56.030 --> 00:40:56.040 align:start position:0%
that we file with the federal government
 
00:40:57.829 --> 00:40:57.839 align:start position:0%
and say we're going to adopt Medicaid
 
00:40:59.990 --> 00:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
expansion but we have some deviations so
 
00:41:02.210 --> 00:41:02.220 align:start position:0%
it's not an uncommon practice for our
 
00:41:03.890 --> 00:41:03.900 align:start position:0%
state to have a deviation from a federal
 
00:41:06.589 --> 00:41:06.599 align:start position:0%
program and notify the feds to that we
 
00:41:08.210 --> 00:41:08.220 align:start position:0%
do and then they'll decide whether or
 
00:41:13.910 --> 00:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:15.589 --> 00:41:15.599 align:start position:0%
thank you very much because nothing to
 
00:41:18.050 --> 00:41:18.060 align:start position:0%
vote on really thank you
 
00:41:20.870 --> 00:41:20.880 align:start position:0%
Mike what else we have
 
00:41:24.109 --> 00:41:24.119 align:start position:0%
as other business uh I've handed out a
 
00:41:26.690 --> 00:41:26.700 align:start position:0%
draft tentative meeting schedule for
 
00:41:30.829 --> 00:41:30.839 align:start position:0%
2023 we should vote on that uh by
 
00:41:32.750 --> 00:41:32.760 align:start position:0%
Statute you would be meeting on Friday
 
00:41:35.990 --> 00:41:36.000 align:start position:0%
January 20th anyways because the law
 
00:41:38.329 --> 00:41:38.339 align:start position:0%
requires that the committee meet the
 
00:41:40.670 --> 00:41:40.680 align:start position:0%
third priority of each month unless the
 
00:41:42.849 --> 00:41:42.859 align:start position:0%
committee adjusts that
 
00:41:44.690 --> 00:41:44.700 align:start position:0%
currently it's been the committee's
 
00:41:47.390 --> 00:41:47.400 align:start position:0%
practice to meet on Fridays during the
 
00:41:50.329 --> 00:41:50.339 align:start position:0%
session so January through June because
 
00:41:53.170 --> 00:41:53.180 align:start position:0%
you're all otherwise busy on Thursdays
 
00:41:56.089 --> 00:41:56.099 align:start position:0%
during the second half of the year when
 
00:41:58.069 --> 00:41:58.079 align:start position:0%
you're out of session the meetings are
 
00:42:01.490 --> 00:42:01.500 align:start position:0%
on Thursday so you don't have to come in
 
00:42:05.210 --> 00:42:05.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:07.250 --> 00:42:07.260 align:start position:0%
I assume Mike we've looked through these
 
00:42:08.690 --> 00:42:08.700 align:start position:0%
dates to make sure we have no holidays
 
00:42:10.010 --> 00:42:10.020 align:start position:0%
in any of these days so we'll have to
 
00:42:11.810 --> 00:42:11.820 align:start position:0%
deal with later
 
00:42:13.730 --> 00:42:13.740 align:start position:0%
um we did it several times with
 
00:42:16.130 --> 00:42:16.140 align:start position:0%
different calendars I do believe that
 
00:42:18.349 --> 00:42:18.359 align:start position:0%
this one's right but if it's not we can
 
00:42:20.690 --> 00:42:20.700 align:start position:0%
fix it it's great so I'll move to
 
00:42:20.700 --> 00:42:21.710 align:start position:0%
fix it it's great so I'll move to
approve

00:42:21.710 --> 00:42:21.720 align:start position:0%
approve
 
00:42:23.030 --> 00:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
so it's been moved by representative
 
00:42:24.410 --> 00:42:24.420 align:start position:0%
Schmidt to approve the calendar as
 
00:42:26.750 --> 00:42:26.760 align:start position:0%
written and presented is there a second
 
00:42:28.910 --> 00:42:28.920 align:start position:0%
by representative Senator Ward sorry
 
00:42:30.230 --> 00:42:30.240 align:start position:0%
I'll get used to that a little bit
 
00:42:32.750 --> 00:42:32.760 align:start position:0%
further discussion yeah thank you Mr
 
00:42:35.150 --> 00:42:35.160 align:start position:0%
Vice chair just a little note for my
 
00:42:37.730 --> 00:42:37.740 align:start position:0%
participation I do have a conflict with
 
00:42:40.430 --> 00:42:40.440 align:start position:0%
the children's oversight commission not
 
00:42:42.349 --> 00:42:42.359 align:start position:0%
every single date is in Conflict but
 
00:42:44.329 --> 00:42:44.339 align:start position:0%
that begins at 10 so there are times
 
00:42:46.670 --> 00:42:46.680 align:start position:0%
that an alternate might be need to be
 
00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:47.690 align:start position:0%
that an alternate might be need to be
seated

00:42:47.690 --> 00:42:47.700 align:start position:0%
seated
 
00:42:51.230 --> 00:42:51.240 align:start position:0%
uh an individual basis I could do an
 
00:42:52.310 --> 00:42:52.320 align:start position:0%
hour here and then leave for the
 
00:42:53.390 --> 00:42:53.400 align:start position:0%
oversight commission so I just wanted to
 
00:42:55.010 --> 00:42:55.020 align:start position:0%
let you know about that
 
00:42:57.410 --> 00:42:57.420 align:start position:0%
great that's why we have alternates
 
00:42:59.630 --> 00:42:59.640 align:start position:0%
any further discussion uh representative
 
00:43:01.490 --> 00:43:01.500 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr Vice chairman
 
00:43:02.930 --> 00:43:02.940 align:start position:0%
um my only question would be around the
 
00:43:05.270 --> 00:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
December 21st I expected I'd probably be
 
00:43:07.130 --> 00:43:07.140 align:start position:0%
traveling with family already if seating
 
00:43:08.930 --> 00:43:08.940 align:start position:0%
an alternate it's acceptable that's
 
00:43:10.309 --> 00:43:10.319 align:start position:0%
wonderful but I just wanted to raise
 
00:43:11.990 --> 00:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
that now since I'm already planning to
 
00:43:13.250 --> 00:43:13.260 align:start position:0%
miss that
 
00:43:15.530 --> 00:43:15.540 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
00:43:17.630 --> 00:43:17.640 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
00:43:19.609 --> 00:43:19.619 align:start position:0%
it's been moved and seconded to approve
 
00:43:21.410 --> 00:43:21.420 align:start position:0%
the gel car meeting dates all those in
 
00:43:22.790 --> 00:43:22.800 align:start position:0%
favor say aye
 
00:43:25.130 --> 00:43:25.140 align:start position:0%
aye opposed nay eyes have it in the
 
00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:26.640 align:start position:0%
calendar is adopted
 
00:43:30.050 --> 00:43:30.060 align:start position:0%
uh turn immoral yes Mr Vice chairman
 
00:43:32.750 --> 00:43:32.760 align:start position:0%
um we would I'm sure the new members are
 
00:43:35.690 --> 00:43:35.700 align:start position:0%
a little bit confused after this and
 
00:43:38.569 --> 00:43:38.579 align:start position:0%
wonder what's going on we do plan to do
 
00:43:41.030 --> 00:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
rulemaking training uh it should take
 
00:43:43.550 --> 00:43:43.560 align:start position:0%
about an hour we can do that at the end
 
00:43:45.890 --> 00:43:45.900 align:start position:0%
of the January meeting unless it's a
 
00:43:47.510 --> 00:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
huge agenda and takes a long time and
 
00:43:50.089 --> 00:43:50.099 align:start position:0%
the committee would rather defer that we
 
00:43:52.430 --> 00:43:52.440 align:start position:0%
can also do individual training in our
 
00:43:55.790 --> 00:43:55.800 align:start position:0%
office we can also send out materials
 
00:43:59.089 --> 00:43:59.099 align:start position:0%
and perhaps a video to help the
 
00:44:00.829 --> 00:44:00.839 align:start position:0%
committee members
 
00:44:02.870 --> 00:44:02.880 align:start position:0%
thank you so let's let's plan on doing
 
00:44:05.450 --> 00:44:05.460 align:start position:0%
at the end of the 20th let's also invite
 
00:44:08.150 --> 00:44:08.160 align:start position:0%
all the alternates so they show up and
 
00:44:10.010 --> 00:44:10.020 align:start position:0%
so they can get the training as well on
 
00:44:11.569 --> 00:44:11.579 align:start position:0%
the 20th and so we'll have all a
 
00:44:12.950 --> 00:44:12.960 align:start position:0%
full-time members all the regular
 
00:44:14.569 --> 00:44:14.579 align:start position:0%
members and all the alternates present
 
00:44:16.370 --> 00:44:16.380 align:start position:0%
at the meeting on the 20th we will do
 
00:44:18.109 --> 00:44:18.119 align:start position:0%
that thank you
 
00:44:20.690 --> 00:44:20.700 align:start position:0%
for the discussion
 
00:44:23.089 --> 00:44:23.099 align:start position:0%
Senator Chandler thank you very much Mr
 
00:44:23.099 --> 00:44:23.870 align:start position:0%
Senator Chandler thank you very much Mr
chair

00:44:23.870 --> 00:44:23.880 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:44:26.630 --> 00:44:26.640 align:start position:0%
um I'm just wondering uh
 
00:44:28.670 --> 00:44:28.680 align:start position:0%
if this is the appropriate time but um
 
00:44:31.130 --> 00:44:31.140 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if it's the custom and
 
00:44:33.650 --> 00:44:33.660 align:start position:0%
practice or a requirement for those not
 
00:44:35.930 --> 00:44:35.940 align:start position:0%
in attendance at a prior meeting to
 
00:44:37.910 --> 00:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
abstain from voting
 
00:44:40.250 --> 00:44:40.260 align:start position:0%
um or approving the minutes
 
00:44:43.309 --> 00:44:43.319 align:start position:0%
we've allowed it in the past okay so we
 
00:44:44.569 --> 00:44:44.579 align:start position:0%
don't have a rule one way or another
 
00:44:46.670 --> 00:44:46.680 align:start position:0%
they're in they can they're free to vote
 
00:44:48.230 --> 00:44:48.240 align:start position:0%
they're free not to vote because the
 
00:44:49.849 --> 00:44:49.859 align:start position:0%
potential is they could listen to the
 
00:44:52.250 --> 00:44:52.260 align:start position:0%
audio in the video if they wanted to and
 
00:44:53.690 --> 00:44:53.700 align:start position:0%
know what happened at the meeting and so
 
00:44:55.370 --> 00:44:55.380 align:start position:0%
therefore feel comfortable voting so
 
00:44:58.069 --> 00:44:58.079 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:45:00.349 --> 00:45:00.359 align:start position:0%
uh just for informational for the
 
00:45:03.170 --> 00:45:03.180 align:start position:0%
committee members on our website which
 
00:45:04.730 --> 00:45:04.740 align:start position:0%
is under gen Court there's
 
00:45:07.190 --> 00:45:07.200 align:start position:0%
administrative rules and under that
 
00:45:11.329 --> 00:45:11.339 align:start position:0%
there are links to uh RSA 541a which is
 
00:45:13.730 --> 00:45:13.740 align:start position:0%
the administrative procedures act there
 
00:45:16.130 --> 00:45:16.140 align:start position:0%
is also a copy of the rulemaking manual
 
00:45:19.490 --> 00:45:19.500 align:start position:0%
that's a rather long document it's a
 
00:45:22.370 --> 00:45:22.380 align:start position:0%
requirement that agencies follow in
 
00:45:24.890 --> 00:45:24.900 align:start position:0%
their Drafting and it also lays out the
 
00:45:27.710 --> 00:45:27.720 align:start position:0%
process to go through a rulemaking
 
00:45:31.130 --> 00:45:31.140 align:start position:0%
procedure it is compliance with it is
 
00:45:34.569 --> 00:45:34.579 align:start position:0%
required by RSA 541a eight
 
00:45:37.130 --> 00:45:37.140 align:start position:0%
there are we make a lot of editorial
 
00:45:39.290 --> 00:45:39.300 align:start position:0%
comments you may have noticed on that we
 
00:45:40.730 --> 00:45:40.740 align:start position:0%
don't bring those to the committee
 
00:45:43.910 --> 00:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
unless we think there's going to be the
 
00:45:46.550 --> 00:45:46.560 align:start position:0%
agency is going to be unwilling to make
 
00:45:49.990 --> 00:45:50.000 align:start position:0%
the change and it would create a problem
 
00:45:53.809 --> 00:45:53.819 align:start position:0%
there is also contained on the website
 
00:45:56.230 --> 00:45:56.240 align:start position:0%
the committee's own rules
 
00:45:59.270 --> 00:45:59.280 align:start position:0%
which are important and we're
 
00:46:02.690 --> 00:46:02.700 align:start position:0%
in the midst of revising both the manual
 
00:46:04.490 --> 00:46:04.500 align:start position:0%
and the committee's rules to bring them
 
00:46:06.829 --> 00:46:06.839 align:start position:0%
up to date they when they're done we
 
00:46:08.630 --> 00:46:08.640 align:start position:0%
will bring them forward to you for a
 
00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:10.490 align:start position:0%
will bring them forward to you for a
vote

00:46:10.490 --> 00:46:10.500 align:start position:0%
vote
 
00:46:10.500 --> 00:46:11.930 align:start position:0%
vote
great

00:46:11.930 --> 00:46:11.940 align:start position:0%
great
 
00:46:15.050 --> 00:46:15.060 align:start position:0%
any further discussions or my items if
 
00:46:28.190 --> 00:46:28.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:33.290 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:46:33.290 --> 00:46:33.300 align:start position:0%
