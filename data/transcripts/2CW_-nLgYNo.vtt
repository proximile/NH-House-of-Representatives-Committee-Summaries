reverse order uh if nobody Minds so we
 
00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:23.120 align:start position:0%

00:06:25.909 --> 00:06:25.919 align:start position:0%
155 uh which is establishing an animal
 
00:06:28.749 --> 00:06:28.759 align:start position:0%
abuse offender registry I open the exec
 
00:06:31.029 --> 00:06:31.039 align:start position:0%
session on that
 
00:06:35.469 --> 00:06:35.479 align:start position:0%
and um do I hear a motion Madam chair uh
 
00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:38.800 align:start position:0%
representative ktoa Madam chair I I make
 
00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:41.880 align:start position:0%
a motion to itl please do I hear a
 
00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:44.360 align:start position:0%
second representative Bixby I'll second
 
00:06:46.749 --> 00:06:46.759 align:start position:0%
that uh representative ktoa would you
 
00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:49.360 align:start position:0%
like to speak to your motion yes Madam
 
00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:51.840 align:start position:0%
chair so this bill although
 
00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:53.150 align:start position:0%
chair so this bill although
well-intentioned

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:53.160 align:start position:0%
well-intentioned
 
00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:57.240 align:start position:0%
really does not accomplish the goal of
 
00:07:02.589 --> 00:07:02.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:05.629 --> 00:07:05.639 align:start position:0%
because they they want a registry but
 
00:07:07.909 --> 00:07:07.919 align:start position:0%
yet we know it's two to three years out
 
00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:11.680 align:start position:0%
before there's any possible legal suit
 
00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:13.960 align:start position:0%
and what they're trying to do is get
 
00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:16.800 align:start position:0%
information prior to that and so this
 
00:07:19.469 --> 00:07:19.479 align:start position:0%
bill would not accomplish their
 
00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:21.960 align:start position:0%
goals is there any discussion other
 
00:07:23.629 --> 00:07:23.639 align:start position:0%
discussion regarding
 
00:07:26.589 --> 00:07:26.599 align:start position:0%
hp55 uh representative Bixby yeah I one
 
00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:30.280 align:start position:0%
of my concerns with this bill is that um
 
00:07:32.869 --> 00:07:32.879 align:start position:0%
it there are a number of due process
 
00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:36.080 align:start position:0%
issues that it brings up that are not uh
 
00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:37.840 align:start position:0%
that are not resolved in the bill and I
 
00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:44.000 align:start position:0%
think that um this uh if the idea is to
 
00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:46.400 align:start position:0%
create better communication between law
 
00:07:49.029 --> 00:07:49.039 align:start position:0%
enforcement agencies this a bill that's
 
00:07:50.629 --> 00:07:50.639 align:start position:0%
concerned considered by this committee
 
00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:53.000 align:start position:0%
is not uh actually the right place to be
 
00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:54.720 align:start position:0%
doing that it it should be something
 
00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:57.120 align:start position:0%
that should be considered by people in
 
00:08:00.309 --> 00:08:00.319 align:start position:0%
in criminal justice and safety who have
 
00:08:03.309 --> 00:08:03.319 align:start position:0%
more expertise in dealing in how law
 
00:08:03.319 --> 00:08:04.629 align:start position:0%
more expertise in dealing in how law
enforcement

00:08:04.629 --> 00:08:04.639 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
00:08:07.589 --> 00:08:07.599 align:start position:0%
works thank you representative Bixby any
 
00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:09.840 align:start position:0%
representative gerana thank you madam
 
00:08:12.149 --> 00:08:12.159 align:start position:0%
chair yes I I want to say I I spoke in
 
00:08:14.309 --> 00:08:14.319 align:start position:0%
the elevator after our hearing with the
 
00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:17.280 align:start position:0%
animal uh control officer uh who was
 
00:08:19.149 --> 00:08:19.159 align:start position:0%
here and and expressed some things that
 
00:08:20.869 --> 00:08:20.879 align:start position:0%
are similar to what representative Bixby
 
00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:23.400 align:start position:0%
was just saying uh she was kind of
 
00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:26.440 align:start position:0%
asking how in the future might be better
 
00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:27.960 align:start position:0%
uh and and we were talking about the
 
00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:29.960 align:start position:0%
idea that there could be
 
00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:35.240 align:start position:0%
a database that uh is for the use not
 
00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:37.360 align:start position:0%
open to the public but is for the use of
 
00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:39.880 align:start position:0%
law enforcement and the idea that
 
00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:42.360 align:start position:0%
possibly um certified or licensed
 
00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:44.640 align:start position:0%
shelters could perhaps for a fee or
 
00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:46.240 align:start position:0%
whatever have access if they're talking
 
00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:49.080 align:start position:0%
about adopting out for example but so uh
 
00:08:52.269 --> 00:08:52.279 align:start position:0%
I agree that it is a good idea but not
 
00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:54.640 align:start position:0%
uh as it would be executed in that bill
 
00:08:57.350 --> 00:08:57.360 align:start position:0%
so I support the itl thank you anyone
 
00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:01.000 align:start position:0%
else represent Sak
 
00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:04.720 align:start position:0%
for all the years that um I've been here
 
00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
this comes up frequently and I think
 
00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:11.640 align:start position:0%
it's um it could be subjective so I've
 
00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:14.760 align:start position:0%
had people call the dog officer on me
 
00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:17.240 align:start position:0%
for dog for animal cruelty because my
 
00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:19.480 align:start position:0%
new Finland dogs were outside in the
 
00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:22.680 align:start position:0%
snow and I would think that they would
 
00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
call them in July when it's so hot I
 
00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:28.320 align:start position:0%
have to bribe my dogs in the winter to
 
00:09:30.949 --> 00:09:30.959 align:start position:0%
come in you know so I think it's a hard
 
00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:32.480 align:start position:0%
thing because people think that they're
 
00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:35.120 align:start position:0%
doing good and they want to protect but
 
00:09:37.829 --> 00:09:37.839 align:start position:0%
I just think it's it's very subjective
 
00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:39.640 align:start position:0%
this animal
 
00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:42.440 align:start position:0%
cruelty thank you representative sopus
 
00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:45.760 align:start position:0%
anybody else seeing none I would ask the
 
00:09:48.389 --> 00:09:48.399 align:start position:0%

second representative Craton second yes
 
00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:18.680 align:start position:0%
ma'am I second okay um do you want to
 
00:11:21.269 --> 00:11:21.279 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion representative
 
00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:25.160 align:start position:0%
Bixby yes um
 
00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:27.150 align:start position:0%
Bixby yes um
the

00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:27.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:34.120 align:start position:0%
uh what we heard uh in testimony uh
 
00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:36.920 align:start position:0%
was uh was that
 
00:11:39.829 --> 00:11:39.839 align:start position:0%
uh kind that these animals really are
 
00:11:44.509 --> 00:11:44.519 align:start position:0%
not uh appropriate for uh home pet own
 
00:11:46.509 --> 00:11:46.519 align:start position:0%
ownership they are essentially wild
 
00:11:51.389 --> 00:11:51.399 align:start position:0%
animals and uh they they don't have the
 
00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:54.160 align:start position:0%
domestication in their bread into them
 
00:11:57.269 --> 00:11:57.279 align:start position:0%
that is necessary to make them viable as
 
00:12:00.030 --> 00:12:00.040 align:start position:0%
uh pets uh for people people who are not
 
00:12:04.389 --> 00:12:04.399 align:start position:0%
really trained and uh have sufficient
 
00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:07.360 align:start position:0%
background we already have a procedure
 
00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:10.680 align:start position:0%
in uh our fishing game laws that allows
 
00:12:12.629 --> 00:12:12.639 align:start position:0%
the ownership of these animals for
 
00:12:15.189 --> 00:12:15.199 align:start position:0%
people who uh show to the fishing game
 
00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:17.160 align:start position:0%
that they have a capability of taking
 
00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:21.440 align:start position:0%
care of them properly uh so I think that
 
00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:25.240 align:start position:0%
uh opening opening ownership of these up
 
00:12:28.509 --> 00:12:28.519 align:start position:0%
to uh people who just want want them
 
00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:31.880 align:start position:0%
because it's a cool idea could end up
 
00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
having our shelters dealing with
 
00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:36.880 align:start position:0%
Kangaroos and short-tail monkeys that
 
00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:39.320 align:start position:0%
people decide they can't handle after a
 
00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:42.240 align:start position:0%
short while and we don't want to put
 
00:12:44.269 --> 00:12:44.279 align:start position:0%
that burden on our shelters
 
00:12:46.509 --> 00:12:46.519 align:start position:0%
representative compa thank you madam
 
00:12:48.829 --> 00:12:48.839 align:start position:0%
chair I think part of the most
 
00:12:50.509 --> 00:12:50.519 align:start position:0%
concerning part of this bill was they
 
00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:53.000 align:start position:0%
would be all designated as companion
 
00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:55.880 align:start position:0%
animals which means that in a disaster
 
00:13:00.389 --> 00:13:00.399 align:start position:0%
they would have to be housed um and also
 
00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:02.680 align:start position:0%
they would be uh subject to the same
 
00:13:06.069 --> 00:13:06.079 align:start position:0%
laws as companion animals for uh a
 
00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:09.800 align:start position:0%
domesticated animals so that really is
 
00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:11.720 align:start position:0%
concerning thank you madam chair
 
00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:13.310 align:start position:0%
concerning thank you madam chair
representive

00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:13.320 align:start position:0%
representive
 
00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:16.440 align:start position:0%
sakias did they happen to say how many
 
00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:19.120 align:start position:0%
are there any of these
 
00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:22.000 align:start position:0%
animals um here like kangaroos do we
 
00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
have kangaroos in New Hampshire or is it
 
00:13:26.629 --> 00:13:26.639 align:start position:0%
just something an
 
00:13:30.350 --> 00:13:30.360 align:start position:0%
aspiration I I have have no IDE answer I
 
00:13:32.590 --> 00:13:32.600 align:start position:0%
belong to quilt and guilds all over the
 
00:13:36.069 --> 00:13:36.079 align:start position:0%
world because of YouTube and um so they
 
00:13:40.189 --> 00:13:40.199 align:start position:0%
show these kangaroos from Australia and
 
00:13:42.829 --> 00:13:42.839 align:start position:0%
they little little shits I mean they
 
00:13:46.509 --> 00:13:46.519 align:start position:0%
beat up excuse me you know I I can't
 
00:13:49.389 --> 00:13:49.399 align:start position:0%
imagine them being a companion animal
 
00:13:51.870 --> 00:13:51.880 align:start position:0%
and in Australia they use them for for
 
00:13:54.389 --> 00:13:54.399 align:start position:0%
animal food but I mean they they can
 
00:13:56.389 --> 00:13:56.399 align:start position:0%
beat the crap out of somebody they're
 
00:13:59.310 --> 00:13:59.320 align:start position:0%
not just like um
 
00:14:00.949 --> 00:14:00.959 align:start position:0%
a little thing that you can go to the
 
00:14:04.629 --> 00:14:04.639 align:start position:0%
movie with well I I I I can appreciate
 
00:14:08.749 --> 00:14:08.759 align:start position:0%
that represent saitis because I I have a
 
00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:11.720 align:start position:0%
a friend of mine in who lives in my town
 
00:14:14.590 --> 00:14:14.600 align:start position:0%
who uh stayed at a was stationed at a a
 
00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:17.920 align:start position:0%
base in um somewhere in Malaysia um and
 
00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
they had a pet short-tailed monkey he
 
00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:23.800 align:start position:0%
told me that they are perpetually
 
00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
vicious and angry and petulant
 
00:14:29.230 --> 00:14:29.240 align:start position:0%
2-year-olds that's how they behave
 
00:14:30.829 --> 00:14:30.839 align:start position:0%
and there's no reasoning with them
 
00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:33.360 align:start position:0%
there's no training them and they can be
 
00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:36.800 align:start position:0%
pretty awful so anyway U representative
 
00:14:39.189 --> 00:14:39.199 align:start position:0%
ger thank you madam chair I think we all
 
00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
Remember The Bugs Bunny with the boxing
 
00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:44.440 align:start position:0%
kangaroo but I did want to just to share
 
00:14:46.189 --> 00:14:46.199 align:start position:0%
with with my committee colleagues and
 
00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:47.880 align:start position:0%
everyone else too this morning on NPR
 
00:14:50.069 --> 00:14:50.079 align:start position:0%
there was a fitting story in Australia
 
00:14:52.030 --> 00:14:52.040 align:start position:0%
they have a contest every year for
 
00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:55.160 align:start position:0%
dancing your PhD thesis so it's a
 
00:14:57.389 --> 00:14:57.399 align:start position:0%
performance dance for your PhD thesis
 
00:14:59.949 --> 00:14:59.959 align:start position:0%
and the guy who won it was on behavior
 
00:15:03.189 --> 00:15:03.199 align:start position:0%
of kangaroos so uh if anyone is is
 
00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:04.720 align:start position:0%
interested enough I'm sure you could
 
00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:06.720 align:start position:0%
probably find that video of the guy
 
00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:09.160 align:start position:0%
performing his PhD thesis on kangaroo
 
00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:11.680 align:start position:0%
behavior all right any other comment on
 
00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:15.480 align:start position:0%
this bill seeing none um I would like
 
00:15:17.310 --> 00:15:17.320 align:start position:0%

00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:40.160 align:start position:0%
motion
 
00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:46.160 align:start position:0%
here um now we know that um any means of
 
00:16:49.230 --> 00:16:49.240 align:start position:0%
eliminating rats and mice is going to
 
00:16:53.389 --> 00:16:53.399 align:start position:0%
result in the end of life of the
 
00:16:58.150 --> 00:16:58.160 align:start position:0%
rodent and um you know not all methods
 
00:17:01.230 --> 00:17:01.240 align:start position:0%
were are going to offer a quick death
 
00:17:04.669 --> 00:17:04.679 align:start position:0%
even snap traps can cause
 
00:17:07.909 --> 00:17:07.919 align:start position:0%
slow uh slow deaths of these uh rodents
 
00:17:07.919 --> 00:17:09.470 align:start position:0%
slow uh slow deaths of these uh rodents
to

00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:09.480 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:17:13.829 --> 00:17:13.839 align:start position:0%
occur but I I feel that um this is a
 
00:17:16.789 --> 00:17:16.799 align:start position:0%
nonchemical based means of
 
00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:19.280 align:start position:0%
eliminating uh the rodent
 
00:17:24.429 --> 00:17:24.439 align:start position:0%
population and I really hesitate to uh
 
00:17:27.870 --> 00:17:27.880 align:start position:0%
take away that option especially since
 
00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:31.120 align:start position:0%
this kind of option is used in places
 
00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:36.640 align:start position:0%
where chemical baits um and
 
00:17:39.870 --> 00:17:39.880 align:start position:0%
pesticides is is something that uh
 
00:17:42.029 --> 00:17:42.039 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be used uh whether it be
 
00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:46.440 align:start position:0%
around in Food Services um any place
 
00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
that um food is grown or food is is
 
00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:54.880 align:start position:0%
held uh I just think that uh to to
 
00:18:01.549 --> 00:18:01.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:06.480 align:start position:0%
elimination uh a trap uh is not really a
 
00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
prudent thing and um you know they use
 
00:18:12.430 --> 00:18:12.440 align:start position:0%
them in commercial kitchens and uh
 
00:18:16.029 --> 00:18:16.039 align:start position:0%
hospitals schools and other places where
 
00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
these chemicals are inappropriate and
 
00:18:22.149 --> 00:18:22.159 align:start position:0%
not safe so um that's why I am um
 
00:18:24.310 --> 00:18:24.320 align:start position:0%
against this kind of
 
00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:29.200 align:start position:0%
banning representative Bixby yeah so
 
00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:34.320 align:start position:0%
um we also heard testimony about um a
 
00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:38.600 align:start position:0%
couple of aspects one is uh the the
 
00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:42.440 align:start position:0%
cruelty of the of this way of dying for
 
00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
the Target animals and although the
 
00:18:48.909 --> 00:18:48.919 align:start position:0%
instructions on the label do say that
 
00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
the animals should be euthanased
 
00:18:54.710 --> 00:18:54.720 align:start position:0%
properly there's no instructions on how
 
00:18:58.310 --> 00:18:58.320 align:start position:0%
that would H how one would do that uh so
 
00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:00.400 align:start position:0%
so it seems like that is a a gap in
 
00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:03.640 align:start position:0%
terms of the uh the education that would
 
00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:07.720 align:start position:0%
be necessary for U nonprofessionals to
 
00:19:11.230 --> 00:19:11.240 align:start position:0%
appropriately use uh use these traps uh
 
00:19:13.950 --> 00:19:13.960 align:start position:0%
the other uh another issue that was
 
00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:17.200 align:start position:0%
brought up was that the bill as written
 
00:19:20.430 --> 00:19:20.440 align:start position:0%
could cause uh a certain amount of uh
 
00:19:23.149 --> 00:19:23.159 align:start position:0%
uncertainty uh in terms
 
00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:27.760 align:start position:0%
of uh whether it you how uh glue traps
 
00:19:32.230 --> 00:19:32.240 align:start position:0%
for insects would fall under this uh uh
 
00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:35.600 align:start position:0%
uh would would be affected by this bill
 
00:19:38.149 --> 00:19:38.159 align:start position:0%
and uh glue traps for insects are a are
 
00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:42.400 align:start position:0%
an important part of in uh uh of um
 
00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:44.760 align:start position:0%
integrated pest control because you use
 
00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:47.640 align:start position:0%
those glue traps in order to uh figure
 
00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
out what the what the current population
 
00:19:54.590 --> 00:19:54.600 align:start position:0%
of of pests of insect pests uh is that
 
00:19:57.710 --> 00:19:57.720 align:start position:0%
you would need to uh to to provide the
 
00:20:01.669 --> 00:20:01.679 align:start position:0%
threshold hold for further treatment uh
 
00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:05.080 align:start position:0%
and but a a third element uh that we we
 
00:20:08.669 --> 00:20:08.679 align:start position:0%
heard of testimony on was
 
00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:12.640 align:start position:0%
the the problems with bycatch from traps
 
00:20:14.909 --> 00:20:14.919 align:start position:0%
that had been inappropriately placed in
 
00:20:18.190 --> 00:20:18.200 align:start position:0%
places where uh Wildlife uh or pets
 
00:20:21.630 --> 00:20:21.640 align:start position:0%
could get into them uh so uh I'm
 
00:20:23.549 --> 00:20:23.559 align:start position:0%
wondering if there is something that can
 
00:20:27.430 --> 00:20:27.440 align:start position:0%
be done to uh improve the way that these
 
00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:30.600 align:start position:0%
traps are used used uh and I'm I think
 
00:20:32.470 --> 00:20:32.480 align:start position:0%
that perhaps an interim study might be a
 
00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
more appropriate
 
00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
motion representative K thank you madam
 
00:20:41.029 --> 00:20:41.039 align:start position:0%
chair um from an agricultural
 
00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:45.640 align:start position:0%
standpoint um we need all options at our
 
00:20:50.909 --> 00:20:50.919 align:start position:0%
disposal to help with the rodent problem
 
00:20:52.870 --> 00:20:52.880 align:start position:0%
as we discussed in
 
00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:54.789 align:start position:0%
as we discussed in
committee

00:20:54.789 --> 00:20:54.799 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:20:58.470 --> 00:20:58.480 align:start position:0%
these the rodents have a two-year life
 
00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
cycle and if you take off 6 months of
 
00:21:04.110 --> 00:21:04.120 align:start position:0%
that they can breed 25
 
00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:08.240 align:start position:0%
times over 18 months with an average
 
00:21:09.470 --> 00:21:09.480 align:start position:0%
litter of
 
00:21:12.750 --> 00:21:12.760 align:start position:0%
six multiply that
 
00:21:16.110 --> 00:21:16.120 align:start position:0%
exponentially they are a public health
 
00:21:18.870 --> 00:21:18.880 align:start position:0%
issue they create
 
00:21:22.310 --> 00:21:22.320 align:start position:0%
disease they create problems in
 
00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:25.200 align:start position:0%
agriculture with our grains with the
 
00:21:27.029 --> 00:21:27.039 align:start position:0%
food supply for our
 
00:21:27.039 --> 00:21:30.789 align:start position:0%
food supply for our
animals

00:21:30.789 --> 00:21:30.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:33.149 --> 00:21:33.159 align:start position:0%
we need
 
00:21:35.870 --> 00:21:35.880 align:start position:0%
options we don't always want to use the
 
00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:39.640 align:start position:0%
bait or the poisons because we don't
 
00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:43.120 align:start position:0%
want our animals getting to these
 
00:21:45.669 --> 00:21:45.679 align:start position:0%
rodents that have died from poisons and
 
00:21:50.149 --> 00:21:50.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:52.789 --> 00:21:52.799 align:start position:0%
sources they are
 
00:21:56.870 --> 00:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
vital to places to put them in a farm
 
00:21:59.590 --> 00:21:59.600 align:start position:0%
stand out of the way
 
00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:02.360 align:start position:0%
to help keep them from eating the foods
 
00:22:03.269 --> 00:22:03.279 align:start position:0%
that are
 
00:22:07.470 --> 00:22:07.480 align:start position:0%
there they are vital in our homes when
 
00:22:09.470 --> 00:22:09.480 align:start position:0%
as part of a
 
00:22:12.830 --> 00:22:12.840 align:start position:0%
solution they're not the you know
 
00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
they're we need options and we need all
 
00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:18.480 align:start position:0%
options on the table to
 
00:22:22.630 --> 00:22:22.640 align:start position:0%
utilize um to help with this problem so
 
00:22:24.909 --> 00:22:24.919 align:start position:0%
I am supporting
 
00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:27.520 align:start position:0%
itl uh representative H Haskins thank
 
00:22:29.630 --> 00:22:29.640 align:start position:0%
you madam chair respectfully I'm going
 
00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:31.600 align:start position:0%
to vote against the
 
00:22:34.830 --> 00:22:34.840 align:start position:0%
itl it seems to me that it's
 
00:22:38.990 --> 00:22:39.000 align:start position:0%
2024 and we have other options I did
 
00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:44.000 align:start position:0%
survey a few of the um stores in my area
 
00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:45.200 align:start position:0%
on the SE
 
00:22:49.230 --> 00:22:49.240 align:start position:0%
Co um hardware stores lumber store and
 
00:22:52.630 --> 00:22:52.640 align:start position:0%
they have the snap traps they have um
 
00:22:55.350 --> 00:22:55.360 align:start position:0%
the electronic ones which I think is a
 
00:22:59.029 --> 00:22:59.039 align:start position:0%
21st century uh device ice I think we
 
00:23:01.950 --> 00:23:01.960 align:start position:0%
can do better than this I do think that
 
00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:06.400 align:start position:0%
the insect strips um should be exempt
 
00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:09.520 align:start position:0%
from this we're talking about rodents
 
00:23:13.950 --> 00:23:13.960 align:start position:0%
not insects so again I can't bring
 
00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:18.880 align:start position:0%
myself to vote for the itl and um I
 
00:23:21.950 --> 00:23:21.960 align:start position:0%
think we can do better thank you okay
 
00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:23.110 align:start position:0%
think we can do better thank you okay
representative

00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:23.120 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:23:26.149 --> 00:23:26.159 align:start position:0%
gerana thank you madam chair uh I agree
 
00:23:28.830 --> 00:23:28.840 align:start position:0%
with representative H Haskins that from
 
00:23:30.870 --> 00:23:30.880 align:start position:0%
what we heard it seems apparent to me
 
00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
that there are other less inhumane
 
00:23:36.630 --> 00:23:36.640 align:start position:0%
methods of of disposing of of rodents
 
00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:38.760 align:start position:0%
dealing with rodent uh infestations
 
00:23:40.269 --> 00:23:40.279 align:start position:0%
which I think we all agree is is
 
00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:42.320 align:start position:0%
something that we need to do uh so I
 
00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:44.480 align:start position:0%
think there are other less inhumane uh
 
00:23:46.269 --> 00:23:46.279 align:start position:0%
tactics and I also think that there are
 
00:23:48.269 --> 00:23:48.279 align:start position:0%
plenty of other tactics that don't have
 
00:23:49.990 --> 00:23:50.000 align:start position:0%
the same potential for negative impact
 
00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:52.240 align:start position:0%
on other animals that are not supposed
 
00:23:55.710 --> 00:23:55.720 align:start position:0%
to be uh I you know um targeted we could
 
00:23:57.549 --> 00:23:57.559 align:start position:0%
do more work on this bill as has been
 
00:23:59.950 --> 00:23:59.960 align:start position:0%
suggested Ed if if we wanted to to kind
 
00:24:01.590 --> 00:24:01.600 align:start position:0%
of clarify for example the difference
 
00:24:04.029 --> 00:24:04.039 align:start position:0%
between rodent traps and insect traps
 
00:24:05.470 --> 00:24:05.480 align:start position:0%
and so for that reason I would support
 
00:24:08.110 --> 00:24:08.120 align:start position:0%
representative bixby's suggestion uh of
 
00:24:10.909 --> 00:24:10.919 align:start position:0%
interim study and finally this is I have
 
00:24:13.549 --> 00:24:13.559 align:start position:0%
to say uh an issue on which I received a
 
00:24:16.149 --> 00:24:16.159 align:start position:0%
lot of emails from constituents from
 
00:24:18.430 --> 00:24:18.440 align:start position:0%
actual constituents from folks in my
 
00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:20.760 align:start position:0%
district in Kean who were very
 
00:24:23.710 --> 00:24:23.720 align:start position:0%
passionate um about the inhumanity
 
00:24:25.350 --> 00:24:25.360 align:start position:0%
involved in this method of dealing with
 
00:24:27.549 --> 00:24:27.559 align:start position:0%
rodents so uh especially to serve the
 
00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:29.440 align:start position:0%
interest of my constituents I'll also be
 
00:24:32.750 --> 00:24:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:35.549 --> 00:24:35.559 align:start position:0%
itl representative uh
 
00:24:39.070 --> 00:24:39.080 align:start position:0%
Howard thank you madam chair um I was
 
00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:41.840 align:start position:0%
somewhat moved by the um the testimony
 
00:24:45.950 --> 00:24:45.960 align:start position:0%
of the um of the professional in the um
 
00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:48.480 align:start position:0%
in his use of them and I'm wondering if
 
00:24:49.950 --> 00:24:49.960 align:start position:0%
there's a way to limit it to that
 
00:24:51.909 --> 00:24:51.919 align:start position:0%
because I feel that they handle them
 
00:24:53.870 --> 00:24:53.880 align:start position:0%
respons more responsibly or not
 
00:24:56.190 --> 00:24:56.200 align:start position:0%
necessarily more responsibly but more um
 
00:24:57.430 --> 00:24:57.440 align:start position:0%
likely to be responsible in the
 
00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:00.480 align:start position:0%
collection and and humane disposal of
 
00:25:02.669 --> 00:25:02.679 align:start position:0%
these things but on on the other hand I
 
00:25:07.669 --> 00:25:07.679 align:start position:0%
wonder how um how uh is it possible is
 
00:25:09.990 --> 00:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
it isn't it going to be difficult to um
 
00:25:13.710 --> 00:25:13.720 align:start position:0%
what's the word uh to to patrol this you
 
00:25:17.789 --> 00:25:17.799 align:start position:0%
know to to actually make it possible to
 
00:25:20.070 --> 00:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
to stop the the sale of these
 
00:25:23.190 --> 00:25:23.200 align:start position:0%
things represent NAB thank you madam
 
00:25:25.029 --> 00:25:25.039 align:start position:0%
chair um I also wanted to say that I'm
 
00:25:26.909 --> 00:25:26.919 align:start position:0%
planning to oppose the itl and i would
 
00:25:29.669 --> 00:25:29.679 align:start position:0%
support a motion of interim study um and
 
00:25:31.190 --> 00:25:31.200 align:start position:0%
part of that is because of the testimony
 
00:25:33.549 --> 00:25:33.559 align:start position:0%
handed out to us that day that shows
 
00:25:35.269 --> 00:25:35.279 align:start position:0%
that the CDC the New Hampshire Fish and
 
00:25:37.070 --> 00:25:37.080 align:start position:0%
Game department the US fish and wildlife
 
00:25:39.470 --> 00:25:39.480 align:start position:0%
service the avma the Canadian Veterinary
 
00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:41.120 align:start position:0%
Medical Association all these
 
00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:42.720 align:start position:0%
organizations oppose the use of glue
 
00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:45.000 align:start position:0%
traps and um to me that's a compelling
 
00:25:47.149 --> 00:25:47.159 align:start position:0%
argument to not use them but um I
 
00:25:49.669 --> 00:25:49.679 align:start position:0%
noticed in the farm bureau's uh written
 
00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:51.360 align:start position:0%
testimony they also mentioned doing an
 
00:25:52.909 --> 00:25:52.919 align:start position:0%
interim study and getting some input
 
00:25:55.269 --> 00:25:55.279 align:start position:0%
from the pesticide control board so for
 
00:25:56.870 --> 00:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
that reason I'd be willing to support a
 
00:25:58.350 --> 00:25:58.360 align:start position:0%
motion of interm study
 
00:26:01.590 --> 00:26:01.600 align:start position:0%
thank you representative kraton thank
 
00:26:04.710 --> 00:26:04.720 align:start position:0%
you madam chair yeah so last year we
 
00:26:07.029 --> 00:26:07.039 align:start position:0%
listened to the renis side bill and the
 
00:26:10.510 --> 00:26:10.520 align:start position:0%
testimony from that was that to to
 
00:26:12.990 --> 00:26:13.000 align:start position:0%
amplify what representative Kon said
 
00:26:16.710 --> 00:26:16.720 align:start position:0%
that 1,200 rats can be offsprings from
 
00:26:20.510 --> 00:26:20.520 align:start position:0%
just a male and a female in one house
 
00:26:23.389 --> 00:26:23.399 align:start position:0%
and then uh we had the pest control guys
 
00:26:25.549 --> 00:26:25.559 align:start position:0%
come in and say Hey you know the if you
 
00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:28.320 align:start position:0%
get rid of R genocides then you'll have
 
00:26:30.310 --> 00:26:30.320 align:start position:0%
mouse droppings and baby carriages and
 
00:26:33.470 --> 00:26:33.480 align:start position:0%
on in in h beds and all that kind of
 
00:26:35.870 --> 00:26:35.880 align:start position:0%
stuff and so this is the second Bild
 
00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:38.480 align:start position:0%
we've seen in two years to pull back on
 
00:26:43.549 --> 00:26:43.559 align:start position:0%
the ability to control pest in in homes
 
00:26:47.830 --> 00:26:47.840 align:start position:0%
in farms and and other places and uh
 
00:26:50.310 --> 00:26:50.320 align:start position:0%
many of the other traps I I use a five
 
00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:52.320 align:start position:0%
gallon bucket that has a trapo on it
 
00:26:54.990 --> 00:26:55.000 align:start position:0%
that's very effective but then that's
 
00:26:56.830 --> 00:26:56.840 align:start position:0%
depending on how often you check it how
 
00:26:58.470 --> 00:26:58.480 align:start position:0%
how they die and there that you know
 
00:27:01.029 --> 00:27:01.039 align:start position:0%
that could be perceived as that as well
 
00:27:03.070 --> 00:27:03.080 align:start position:0%
you know you don't you know what are you
 
00:27:04.110 --> 00:27:04.120 align:start position:0%
going to do with those mice you're going
 
00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:05.200 align:start position:0%
to kill them or you going to let them go
 
00:27:06.149 --> 00:27:06.159 align:start position:0%
in the woods what are you goingon to do
 
00:27:08.669 --> 00:27:08.679 align:start position:0%
with them but at the end of the day it
 
00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:12.640 align:start position:0%
eliminates that health risk um from from
 
00:27:16.590 --> 00:27:16.600 align:start position:0%
my house so I I'm suppor of I on this
 
00:27:18.630 --> 00:27:18.640 align:start position:0%
because I think that from a health
 
00:27:21.669 --> 00:27:21.679 align:start position:0%
perspective and from a safety of food
 
00:27:24.230 --> 00:27:24.240 align:start position:0%
perspective uh we need to have those
 
00:27:28.190 --> 00:27:28.200 align:start position:0%
methods available uh to get rid of V
 
00:27:31.870 --> 00:27:31.880 align:start position:0%
rodents over any other
 
00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:34.960 align:start position:0%

Askin that's quite all right sorry no
 
00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
problem um well I think the arguments
 
00:29:06.750 --> 00:29:06.760 align:start position:0%
have been outlined that we would like to
 
00:29:10.149 --> 00:29:10.159 align:start position:0%
look at what are the 21st century
 
00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:12.840 align:start position:0%
options I think we all have the goal of
 
00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:14.760 align:start position:0%
being the most
 
00:29:19.230 --> 00:29:19.240 align:start position:0%
Humane uh method of getting rid of pests
 
00:29:22.110 --> 00:29:22.120 align:start position:0%
that do the harm that has been stated
 
00:29:24.549 --> 00:29:24.559 align:start position:0%
but I really think there are other
 
00:29:26.669 --> 00:29:26.679 align:start position:0%
options and we need a little more data
 
00:29:29.549 --> 00:29:29.559 align:start position:0%
about how available those options are
 
00:29:32.710 --> 00:29:32.720 align:start position:0%
where they can and can't be used and I'd
 
00:29:36.430 --> 00:29:36.440 align:start position:0%
be happy to be part of that okay any
 
00:29:38.789 --> 00:29:38.799 align:start position:0%
other representative ger thank you madam
 
00:29:41.990 --> 00:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
chair uh and I wanted to speak also to a
 
00:29:43.470 --> 00:29:43.480 align:start position:0%
good point that representative Katon
 
00:29:45.070 --> 00:29:45.080 align:start position:0%
brought up before which is thinking back
 
00:29:46.950 --> 00:29:46.960 align:start position:0%
to when we when we looked at the redenti
 
00:29:49.830 --> 00:29:49.840 align:start position:0%
side Bill last year and I know I for one
 
00:29:52.590 --> 00:29:52.600 align:start position:0%
when I first came into that bill was my
 
00:29:54.430 --> 00:29:54.440 align:start position:0%
initial reaction was to be in in favor
 
00:29:55.909 --> 00:29:55.919 align:start position:0%
of that bill but we heard some really
 
00:29:58.470 --> 00:29:58.480 align:start position:0%
compelling testimony uh from the the
 
00:30:00.350 --> 00:30:00.360 align:start position:0%
pest control specialist and and from
 
00:30:03.710 --> 00:30:03.720 align:start position:0%
some other folks who testified and came
 
00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:06.080 align:start position:0%
around to the conclusion that that bill
 
00:30:07.950 --> 00:30:07.960 align:start position:0%
as it was written was not appropriate
 
00:30:10.110 --> 00:30:10.120 align:start position:0%
that it didn't give people a tool that
 
00:30:12.990 --> 00:30:13.000 align:start position:0%
they needed to be able to control um
 
00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:15.360 align:start position:0%
possibility of rat infestations rodent
 
00:30:18.230 --> 00:30:18.240 align:start position:0%
infestations uh and so you know we
 
00:30:20.110 --> 00:30:20.120 align:start position:0%
didn't end up passing that bill so I
 
00:30:21.470 --> 00:30:21.480 align:start position:0%
hear what representative kraton is
 
00:30:22.990 --> 00:30:23.000 align:start position:0%
saying about you know we see these bills
 
00:30:25.149 --> 00:30:25.159 align:start position:0%
come back in that case we heard the
 
00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:27.360 align:start position:0%
testimony and a lot of us ended up
 
00:30:29.310 --> 00:30:29.320 align:start position:0%
agreeing that that bill was in the end
 
00:30:31.269 --> 00:30:31.279 align:start position:0%
taking a necessary tool out of the hands
 
00:30:33.590 --> 00:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
of of people who need it uh this is a
 
00:30:35.630 --> 00:30:35.640 align:start position:0%
case where I think with some more study
 
00:30:37.310 --> 00:30:37.320 align:start position:0%
to differentiate between different kinds
 
00:30:39.509 --> 00:30:39.519 align:start position:0%
of glue traps and also to think about
 
00:30:41.549 --> 00:30:41.559 align:start position:0%
how this fits into the larger Arsenal
 
00:30:43.590 --> 00:30:43.600 align:start position:0%
that uh folks have at their disposal for
 
00:30:45.750 --> 00:30:45.760 align:start position:0%
dealing with rodents I think interim
 
00:30:47.669 --> 00:30:47.679 align:start position:0%
study is an appropriate motion so thank
 
00:30:50.190 --> 00:30:50.200 align:start position:0%
you representative Bixby I'd also like
 
00:30:51.870 --> 00:30:51.880 align:start position:0%
to point out that on that rodenticide
 
00:30:55.029 --> 00:30:55.039 align:start position:0%
bill we moved that interim study and did
 
00:30:58.509 --> 00:30:58.519 align:start position:0%
have input from the pesti pesticide
 
00:31:03.269 --> 00:31:03.279 align:start position:0%
control board uh before we um uh before
 
00:31:06.029 --> 00:31:06.039 align:start position:0%
we disposed of it in the fall as being
 
00:31:08.350 --> 00:31:08.360 align:start position:0%
as recommending um oh actually we we
 
00:31:11.070 --> 00:31:11.080 align:start position:0%
moved it uh retained that and then we we
 
00:31:14.590 --> 00:31:14.600 align:start position:0%
did inter we did the um itl in the fall
 
00:31:17.149 --> 00:31:17.159 align:start position:0%
after we had gotten information from the
 
00:31:19.830 --> 00:31:19.840 align:start position:0%
pesticide control board and I'd actually
 
00:31:22.470 --> 00:31:22.480 align:start position:0%
like to get some updates from them about
 
00:31:24.389 --> 00:31:24.399 align:start position:0%
what the current federal status is
 
00:31:26.789 --> 00:31:26.799 align:start position:0%
because there was part of the reason
 
00:31:28.269 --> 00:31:28.279 align:start position:0%
that we
 
00:31:31.509 --> 00:31:31.519 align:start position:0%
uh eventually it that was because of
 
00:31:33.389 --> 00:31:33.399 align:start position:0%
potential Federal Federal legislation
 
00:31:35.629 --> 00:31:35.639 align:start position:0%
that would affect it but but on the top
 
00:31:38.350 --> 00:31:38.360 align:start position:0%
on this topic I think that uh we can it
 
00:31:42.029 --> 00:31:42.039 align:start position:0%
makes sense to do a study to um to
 
00:31:45.269 --> 00:31:45.279 align:start position:0%
figure out what options there are for um
 
00:31:47.070 --> 00:31:47.080 align:start position:0%
for making sure that the traps are
 
00:31:52.149 --> 00:31:52.159 align:start position:0%
handled better okay any other comment on
 
00:31:55.509 --> 00:31:55.519 align:start position:0%
this seeing none I uh would like the
 
00:31:57.470 --> 00:31:57.480 align:start position:0%

landfills and the definition of
 
00:33:24.950 --> 00:33:24.960 align:start position:0%
development of regional
 
00:33:28.430 --> 00:33:28.440 align:start position:0%
impact um now as I understand there was
 
00:33:31.310 --> 00:33:31.320 align:start position:0%
an amendment that was forthcoming for
 
00:33:33.509 --> 00:33:33.519 align:start position:0%
this and
 
00:33:38.830 --> 00:33:38.840 align:start position:0%
um it is not come to us yet so um I
 
00:33:45.230 --> 00:33:45.240 align:start position:0%
would be looking to um move this uh exec
 
00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
session to next week and also have
 
00:33:50.310 --> 00:33:50.320 align:start position:0%
representative ger give us an update on
 
00:33:52.669 --> 00:33:52.679 align:start position:0%
uh what was happening with this
 
00:33:55.549 --> 00:33:55.559 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you madam chair uh and I
 
00:33:57.470 --> 00:33:57.480 align:start position:0%
appreciate the willingness of the chair
 
00:33:59.430 --> 00:33:59.440 align:start position:0%
and the committee to exec this next week
 
00:34:01.669 --> 00:34:01.679 align:start position:0%
I've been working with the prime sponsor
 
00:34:05.029 --> 00:34:05.039 align:start position:0%
to amend a couple of of parts of the
 
00:34:06.789 --> 00:34:06.799 align:start position:0%
bill that we talked about uh for example
 
00:34:09.310 --> 00:34:09.320 align:start position:0%
one the distance that we we would be
 
00:34:11.389 --> 00:34:11.399 align:start position:0%
talking about originally I believe the
 
00:34:13.950 --> 00:34:13.960 align:start position:0%
bill was at 20 miles we're looking at
 
00:34:16.750 --> 00:34:16.760 align:start position:0%
changing that to 10 miles uh and then
 
00:34:19.869 --> 00:34:19.879 align:start position:0%
also the um trying to make sure that
 
00:34:21.349 --> 00:34:21.359 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about water sheds we
 
00:34:22.950 --> 00:34:22.960 align:start position:0%
have the right maps that we're
 
00:34:24.909 --> 00:34:24.919 align:start position:0%
referencing uh and so we have that
 
00:34:27.109 --> 00:34:27.119 align:start position:0%
information we submitted it to ol
 
00:34:28.869 --> 00:34:28.879 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the amendment we received
 
00:34:30.990 --> 00:34:31.000 align:start position:0%
back yesterday was missing some of that
 
00:34:33.349 --> 00:34:33.359 align:start position:0%
Vital Information so uh we are
 
00:34:34.750 --> 00:34:34.760 align:start position:0%
continuing to work with them we should
 
00:34:36.790 --> 00:34:36.800 align:start position:0%
have it very very soon so the committee
 
00:34:38.869 --> 00:34:38.879 align:start position:0%
will have a week to look at the amended
 
00:34:41.790 --> 00:34:41.800 align:start position:0%
uh the proposed amendment thank you okay
 
00:34:46.669 --> 00:34:46.679 align:start position:0%
thank you um so I am going to um
 
00:34:49.629 --> 00:34:49.639 align:start position:0%
postpone this or I guess I don't
 
00:34:51.710 --> 00:34:51.720 align:start position:0%
remember the correct wording for it I
 
00:34:57.069 --> 00:34:57.079 align:start position:0%
guess uh to recess this thank you recess
 
00:35:02.230 --> 00:35:02.240 align:start position:0%
the exac for um for this bill hb1
 
00:35:06.790 --> 00:35:06.800 align:start position:0%
1221 uh for next week uh when we exec
 
00:35:11.270 --> 00:35:11.280 align:start position:0%
our bills at 10:00 Wednesday March
 
00:35:15.430 --> 00:35:15.440 align:start position:0%
13th and uh so I'm going to uh recess
 
00:35:20.190 --> 00:35:20.200 align:start position:0%
this exec until then and there we go end
 
00:35:25.310 --> 00:35:25.320 align:start position:0%
it um and so we are not uh scheduled
 
00:35:29.430 --> 00:35:29.440 align:start position:0%

00:51:37.549 --> 00:51:37.559 align:start position:0%
thoughts on this bill is that
 
00:51:37.559 --> 00:51:39.430 align:start position:0%
thoughts on this bill is that
um

00:51:39.430 --> 00:51:39.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:42.190 --> 00:51:42.200 align:start position:0%
um I don't I don't know that we need to
 
00:51:44.510 --> 00:51:44.520 align:start position:0%
change anything stat statutorily
 
00:51:46.630 --> 00:51:46.640 align:start position:0%
regarding this it it seemed to me that
 
00:51:51.069 --> 00:51:51.079 align:start position:0%
what we were we were having to um look
 
00:51:54.309 --> 00:51:54.319 align:start position:0%
at is really a local zoning issue that's
 
00:51:56.670 --> 00:51:56.680 align:start position:0%
been a problem
 
00:52:01.030 --> 00:52:01.040 align:start position:0%
um and I I'm not so sure that um
 
00:52:05.309 --> 00:52:05.319 align:start position:0%
further defining co-ownership of dogs in
 
00:52:08.309 --> 00:52:08.319 align:start position:0%
our statutes would really make any kind
 
00:52:10.549 --> 00:52:10.559 align:start position:0%
of difference
 
00:52:13.430 --> 00:52:13.440 align:start position:0%
um I don't know what any other thoughts
 
00:52:13.440 --> 00:52:15.430 align:start position:0%
um I don't know what any other thoughts
on

00:52:15.430 --> 00:52:15.440 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:52:18.990 --> 00:52:19.000 align:start position:0%
that representative Howard I agree Madam
 
00:52:21.789 --> 00:52:21.799 align:start position:0%
chair and um I think that uh the
 
00:52:24.349 --> 00:52:24.359 align:start position:0%
enforcement of zoning is difficult but
 
00:52:26.270 --> 00:52:26.280 align:start position:0%
it does fall in the perview of the city
 
00:52:28.430 --> 00:52:28.440 align:start position:0%
the city or the town rather than um here
 
00:52:30.789 --> 00:52:30.799 align:start position:0%
at the state level yeah because it would
 
00:52:34.950 --> 00:52:34.960 align:start position:0%
seem to me that if if this um person is
 
00:52:37.870 --> 00:52:37.880 align:start position:0%
is running a Doggy Daycare of some sort
 
00:52:39.190 --> 00:52:39.200 align:start position:0%
that that's a business that would have
 
00:52:42.270 --> 00:52:42.280 align:start position:0%
to be um declared with the Secretary of
 
00:52:45.829 --> 00:52:45.839 align:start position:0%
State's office and there's a whole whole
 
00:52:48.309 --> 00:52:48.319 align:start position:0%
protocol that goes along with that it's
 
00:52:51.150 --> 00:52:51.160 align:start position:0%
not just that uh you know someone is
 
00:52:54.230 --> 00:52:54.240 align:start position:0%
deciding to quote unquote watch a
 
00:52:57.990 --> 00:52:58.000 align:start position:0%
friend's dog for the afternoon um this
 
00:53:00.510 --> 00:53:00.520 align:start position:0%
person is running a business and there
 
00:53:02.789 --> 00:53:02.799 align:start position:0%
are local zoning ordinances regarding
 
00:53:07.349 --> 00:53:07.359 align:start position:0%
these businesses so um yeah I I'm I'm
 
00:53:10.510 --> 00:53:10.520 align:start position:0%
not real keen on making any kind of uh
 
00:53:13.950 --> 00:53:13.960 align:start position:0%
changes representative Bixby yeah so um
 
00:53:17.589 --> 00:53:17.599 align:start position:0%
I see a couple of issues one is that uh
 
00:53:19.510 --> 00:53:19.520 align:start position:0%
there is a
 
00:53:22.190 --> 00:53:22.200 align:start position:0%
practical uh there there's a there's an
 
00:53:23.750 --> 00:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
existing practice in terms of
 
00:53:26.829 --> 00:53:26.839 align:start position:0%
co-ownership of dogs that is in the uh
 
00:53:29.910 --> 00:53:29.920 align:start position:0%
in the show dog world uh and that is
 
00:53:32.630 --> 00:53:32.640 align:start position:0%
done entirely through contract law right
 
00:53:34.910 --> 00:53:34.920 align:start position:0%
and that's probably where it really
 
00:53:38.950 --> 00:53:38.960 align:start position:0%
belongs uh the other thing is that uh
 
00:53:40.789 --> 00:53:40.799 align:start position:0%
the description of the problem we heard
 
00:53:44.910 --> 00:53:44.920 align:start position:0%
in Manchester was really an issue of
 
00:53:49.109 --> 00:53:49.119 align:start position:0%
fraud uh that exactly the uh that people
 
00:53:51.630 --> 00:53:51.640 align:start position:0%
who wanted their dogs taken care of by
 
00:53:55.910 --> 00:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
this particular person would uh have
 
00:53:59.430 --> 00:53:59.440 align:start position:0%
that uh caretaker added to the dog's
 
00:54:02.549 --> 00:54:02.559 align:start position:0%
registration and this seems like uh
 
00:54:05.150 --> 00:54:05.160 align:start position:0%
something that would probably be more in
 
00:54:07.270 --> 00:54:07.280 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General's ballpark than
 
00:54:12.510 --> 00:54:12.520 align:start position:0%
ours exactly any other comments on this
 
00:54:14.870 --> 00:54:14.880 align:start position:0%
bill represent
 
00:54:18.270 --> 00:54:18.280 align:start position:0%
STIs um I'm not sure if you all know how
 
00:54:21.390 --> 00:54:21.400 align:start position:0%
much money is tied up in showd dogs but
 
00:54:23.670 --> 00:54:23.680 align:start position:0%
um what you're paying for in showd dogs
 
00:54:26.910 --> 00:54:26.920 align:start position:0%
is you're paying for their the lineage
 
00:54:31.470 --> 00:54:31.480 align:start position:0%
so um there's I have newand dogs and
 
00:54:34.069 --> 00:54:34.079 align:start position:0%
when you buy them from a a reputable
 
00:54:36.950 --> 00:54:36.960 align:start position:0%
breeder that has a huge show thing you
 
00:54:39.950 --> 00:54:39.960 align:start position:0%
end up paying that money that she's put
 
00:54:43.549 --> 00:54:43.559 align:start position:0%
into her line and um the line that I
 
00:54:47.190 --> 00:54:47.200 align:start position:0%
have um actually just got she pulled in
 
00:54:51.710 --> 00:54:51.720 align:start position:0%
another dog from um Poland so that she
 
00:54:54.589 --> 00:54:54.599 align:start position:0%
could keep her line fresh and good and
 
00:54:57.109 --> 00:54:57.119 align:start position:0%
so I know we're going to hear a bill
 
00:54:59.589 --> 00:54:59.599 align:start position:0%
this afternoon about the dogs with and
 
00:55:03.150 --> 00:55:03.160 align:start position:0%
cats with mushed in faces but that is a
 
00:55:06.349 --> 00:55:06.359 align:start position:0%
problem of poor breeding and
 
00:55:11.270 --> 00:55:11.280 align:start position:0%
so co-ownership of dogs in the in the um
 
00:55:13.750 --> 00:55:13.760 align:start position:0%
I would say that some of these dogs are
 
00:55:15.309 --> 00:55:15.319 align:start position:0%
20 and
 
00:55:18.030 --> 00:55:18.040 align:start position:0%
$30,000 it's a significant amount of
 
00:55:22.950 --> 00:55:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:26.510 --> 00:55:26.520 align:start position:0%
level any other discussion about this
 
00:55:26.520 --> 00:55:29.230 align:start position:0%
level any other discussion about this
bill

00:55:29.230 --> 00:55:29.240 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:55:32.910 --> 00:55:32.920 align:start position:0%
concerns okay well yeah I mean I I I I
 
00:55:36.789 --> 00:55:36.799 align:start position:0%
do see that um with this bill um the
 
00:55:38.910 --> 00:55:38.920 align:start position:0%
problem that it's trying to solve really
 
00:55:42.309 --> 00:55:42.319 align:start position:0%
is an issue of fraud it's an issue of um
 
00:55:47.470 --> 00:55:47.480 align:start position:0%
local zoning um and I I don't know that
 
00:55:53.670 --> 00:55:53.680 align:start position:0%
um making any kind of change to um to
 
00:55:57.029 --> 00:55:57.039 align:start position:0%
co-ownership in our statute is going to
 
00:56:00.470 --> 00:56:00.480 align:start position:0%
change anything um with having to do
 
00:56:03.390 --> 00:56:03.400 align:start position:0%
with the issue that's being dealt or
 
00:56:07.710 --> 00:56:07.720 align:start position:0%
being um dealt with in Manchester
 
00:56:11.750 --> 00:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
so um with that I guess we have no other
 
00:56:14.829 --> 00:56:14.839 align:start position:0%
conversation on uh HB
 
00:56:19.910 --> 00:56:19.920 align:start position:0%
1316 and so um move on to HB 1173
 
00:56:21.990 --> 00:56:22.000 align:start position:0%
relative to the disposition of vicious
 
00:56:25.470 --> 00:56:25.480 align:start position:0%
dogs anybody have any idea um thoughts
 
00:56:30.309 --> 00:56:30.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:33.390 --> 00:56:33.400 align:start position:0%
bill represent muray thank you madam
 
00:56:36.510 --> 00:56:36.520 align:start position:0%
chair if if just so I'm sure that we're
 
00:56:39.349 --> 00:56:39.359 align:start position:0%
we're talking about the requirement for
 
00:56:41.190 --> 00:56:41.200 align:start position:0%
uh muzzling is that
 
00:56:44.829 --> 00:56:44.839 align:start position:0%
correct no no this is a bill that
 
00:56:46.750 --> 00:56:46.760 align:start position:0%
provides for the euthanizing of dogs
 
00:56:48.910 --> 00:56:48.920 align:start position:0%
that attack humans than I apologize or
 
00:56:53.390 --> 00:56:53.400 align:start position:0%
domestic animals and um I mean as far as
 
00:56:55.910 --> 00:56:55.920 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned we already have we already
 
00:56:59.750 --> 00:56:59.760 align:start position:0%
have legis statute that deals with dogs
 
00:57:02.750 --> 00:57:02.760 align:start position:0%
that are vicious and that cause
 
00:57:02.760 --> 00:57:04.470 align:start position:0%
that are vicious and that cause
damage

00:57:04.470 --> 00:57:04.480 align:start position:0%
damage
 
00:57:09.670 --> 00:57:09.680 align:start position:0%
um so represent Bixby yeah and uh the
 
00:57:13.390 --> 00:57:13.400 align:start position:0%
existing statutes that deal with uh dogs
 
00:57:16.150 --> 00:57:16.160 align:start position:0%
that are problematic uh you know vicious
 
00:57:20.430 --> 00:57:20.440 align:start position:0%
or uh or or causing other problems does
 
00:57:24.430 --> 00:57:24.440 align:start position:0%
allow uh local law enforcement and uh
 
00:57:28.190 --> 00:57:28.200 align:start position:0%
the courts to impose restrictions on
 
00:57:31.430 --> 00:57:31.440 align:start position:0%
animals that are being uh that are um
 
00:57:34.990 --> 00:57:35.000 align:start position:0%
deemed vicious and that and those
 
00:57:38.750 --> 00:57:38.760 align:start position:0%
measures could uh on multiple uh after
 
00:57:43.029 --> 00:57:43.039 align:start position:0%
multiple fences include uh euthanasia
 
00:57:45.950 --> 00:57:45.960 align:start position:0%
but uh making it
 
00:57:48.950 --> 00:57:48.960 align:start position:0%
required H does not leave enough human
 
00:57:52.549 --> 00:57:52.559 align:start position:0%
discretion in the process and there
 
00:57:54.270 --> 00:57:54.280 align:start position:0%
there needs to be human discretion in
 
00:57:56.470 --> 00:57:56.480 align:start position:0%
order to for instance one one issue that
 
00:57:59.510 --> 00:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
was brought up was what if the dog that
 
00:58:03.109 --> 00:58:03.119 align:start position:0%
you have two dogs one is a that get into
 
00:58:08.270 --> 00:58:08.280 align:start position:0%
a fight one is uh a dog that initiates
 
00:58:13.270 --> 00:58:13.280 align:start position:0%
the problem and uh by harassing this the
 
00:58:15.829 --> 00:58:15.839 align:start position:0%
second dog the second dog responds by
 
00:58:20.109 --> 00:58:20.119 align:start position:0%
defending itself and causing a bite to
 
00:58:22.990 --> 00:58:23.000 align:start position:0%
the to the uh dog that started the
 
00:58:27.270 --> 00:58:27.280 align:start position:0%
problem uh that see but the dog that
 
00:58:30.349 --> 00:58:30.359 align:start position:0%
would Su that would be under this
 
00:58:33.549 --> 00:58:33.559 align:start position:0%
proposed under this bill the dog that
 
00:58:36.910 --> 00:58:36.920 align:start position:0%
responded is the one that would be
 
00:58:40.549 --> 00:58:40.559 align:start position:0%
subject to being euthanased uh if a dog
 
00:58:44.750 --> 00:58:44.760 align:start position:0%
is on its own property guarding sheep
 
00:58:46.670 --> 00:58:46.680 align:start position:0%
and some someone
 
00:58:49.430 --> 00:58:49.440 align:start position:0%
trespasses if that happens twice and
 
00:58:51.150 --> 00:58:51.160 align:start position:0%
that dog bites a
 
00:58:53.510 --> 00:58:53.520 align:start position:0%
trespasser that dog would be euthanased
 
00:58:55.950 --> 00:58:55.960 align:start position:0%
under this bill MH that is not
 
00:58:58.029 --> 00:58:58.039 align:start position:0%
appropriate right and there needs to the
 
00:59:01.950 --> 00:59:01.960 align:start position:0%
current law that has the ability for the
 
00:59:03.910 --> 00:59:03.920 align:start position:0%
law enforcement and the judge to use
 
00:59:08.109 --> 00:59:08.119 align:start position:0%
discretion is uh is the way it should be
 
00:59:12.829 --> 00:59:12.839 align:start position:0%
which is RSA 466 colon 28 I
 
00:59:15.349 --> 00:59:15.359 align:start position:0%
believe thank you representative
 
00:59:17.670 --> 00:59:17.680 align:start position:0%
gerana thank you madam chair and I agree
 
00:59:19.750 --> 00:59:19.760 align:start position:0%
with much of what represented Bixby uh
 
00:59:20.950 --> 00:59:20.960 align:start position:0%
just said and it's just for the
 
00:59:22.670 --> 00:59:22.680 align:start position:0%
committee and I could send it around if
 
00:59:24.150 --> 00:59:24.160 align:start position:0%
anyone wants to see it Michigan State
 
00:59:26.230 --> 00:59:26.240 align:start position:0%
University their animal legal and
 
00:59:28.470 --> 00:59:28.480 align:start position:0%
Historical Center has a list of all of
 
00:59:31.190 --> 00:59:31.200 align:start position:0%
the states who have dangerous dog laws
 
00:59:33.789 --> 00:59:33.799 align:start position:0%
uh including Youth and Asia laws and
 
00:59:36.470 --> 00:59:36.480 align:start position:0%
then most of them are as representative
 
00:59:39.270 --> 00:59:39.280 align:start position:0%
Bixby was describing uh discretionary so
 
00:59:40.710 --> 00:59:40.720 align:start position:0%
that there's a panel or that there's an
 
00:59:43.109 --> 00:59:43.119 align:start position:0%
official and evidence is weighed a few
 
00:59:45.910 --> 00:59:45.920 align:start position:0%
states do appear to have mandatory but
 
00:59:48.270 --> 00:59:48.280 align:start position:0%
those appear to involve really vicious
 
00:59:50.309 --> 00:59:50.319 align:start position:0%
attacks we're not talking about a bite
 
00:59:51.870 --> 00:59:51.880 align:start position:0%
that breaks the skin we're talking about
 
00:59:54.069 --> 00:59:54.079 align:start position:0%
a significant you know mauling a really
 
00:59:57.270 --> 00:59:57.280 align:start position:0%
tragic event so um and I can if any I
 
00:59:58.990 --> 00:59:59.000 align:start position:0%
can send that link around if anyone
 
01:00:00.430 --> 01:00:00.440 align:start position:0%
wants to see it because I think it's a
 
01:00:02.670 --> 01:00:02.680 align:start position:0%
good comparison with other states but I
 
01:00:04.829 --> 01:00:04.839 align:start position:0%
agree it's something that should be left
 
01:00:07.789 --> 01:00:07.799 align:start position:0%
up to officials or panels or some level
 
01:00:10.829 --> 01:00:10.839 align:start position:0%
of human discretion so thank you agree
 
01:00:10.839 --> 01:00:11.549 align:start position:0%
of human discretion so thank you agree
with

01:00:11.549 --> 01:00:11.559 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:00:14.870 --> 01:00:14.880 align:start position:0%
that anyone else have any comments on
 
01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:16.029 align:start position:0%
that anyone else have any comments on
this

01:00:16.029 --> 01:00:16.039 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:00:20.349 --> 01:00:20.359 align:start position:0%
bill okay seeing none we can move along
 
01:00:23.549 --> 01:00:23.559 align:start position:0%
then um
 
01:00:23.559 --> 01:00:25.430 align:start position:0%
then um
h501

01:00:25.430 --> 01:00:25.440 align:start position:0%
h501
 
01:00:27.990 --> 01:00:28.000 align:start position:0%
repealing the requirement to register
 
01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.630 align:start position:0%
repealing the requirement to register
dogs

01:00:30.630 --> 01:00:30.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:33.910 --> 01:00:33.920 align:start position:0%
annually um there's been a lot of emails
 
01:00:36.829 --> 01:00:36.839 align:start position:0%
flying back and forth um regarding this
 
01:00:40.029 --> 01:00:40.039 align:start position:0%
bill because I know representative
 
01:00:43.069 --> 01:00:43.079 align:start position:0%
Hobson wanted was was
 
01:00:46.309 --> 01:00:46.319 align:start position:0%
contemplating um submitting an amendment
 
01:00:47.589 --> 01:00:47.599 align:start position:0%
to this
 
01:00:51.750 --> 01:00:51.760 align:start position:0%
bill which would um get rid of the
 
01:00:54.910 --> 01:00:54.920 align:start position:0%
entire bill but address a problem
 
01:00:59.510 --> 01:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
problem having to do with um
 
01:01:02.870 --> 01:01:02.880 align:start position:0%
notification if somebody is delinquent
 
01:01:06.670 --> 01:01:06.680 align:start position:0%
in in obtaining a dog license then uh
 
01:01:08.309 --> 01:01:08.319 align:start position:0%
the town clerk has to send them some
 
01:01:09.870 --> 01:01:09.880 align:start position:0%
sort of notification in the mail
 
01:01:13.309 --> 01:01:13.319 align:start position:0%
certified mail and in statute right now
 
01:01:16.109 --> 01:01:16.119 align:start position:0%
there's a specific dollar amount that um
 
01:01:19.390 --> 01:01:19.400 align:start position:0%
they specify should be spent or is
 
01:01:22.710 --> 01:01:22.720 align:start position:0%
allowed to be spent and uh postage is
 
01:01:26.109 --> 01:01:26.119 align:start position:0%
gone up since the statute was enacted so
 
01:01:28.470 --> 01:01:28.480 align:start position:0%
she wanted to put an amendment that
 
01:01:32.309 --> 01:01:32.319 align:start position:0%
would change that to allow
 
01:01:38.190 --> 01:01:38.200 align:start position:0%
for um proper postage to be um uh you
 
01:01:40.950 --> 01:01:40.960 align:start position:0%
know take so that the town doesn't have
 
01:01:44.069 --> 01:01:44.079 align:start position:0%
to pay that uh difference in postage
 
01:01:47.029 --> 01:01:47.039 align:start position:0%
that the postage is then uh paid for by
 
01:01:49.430 --> 01:01:49.440 align:start position:0%
the uh person who the mail is being sent
 
01:01:51.910 --> 01:01:51.920 align:start position:0%
to anyway there so there's been some
 
01:01:55.309 --> 01:01:55.319 align:start position:0%
discussion about um put putting an
 
01:01:57.069 --> 01:01:57.079 align:start position:0%
amendment on this
 
01:02:01.309 --> 01:02:01.319 align:start position:0%
bill um but the underlying Bill itself I
 
01:02:04.109 --> 01:02:04.119 align:start position:0%
think uh repealing the dog
 
01:02:06.670 --> 01:02:06.680 align:start position:0%
licensing uh is not something that I
 
01:02:08.910 --> 01:02:08.920 align:start position:0%
would be in favor of simply because of
 
01:02:11.430 --> 01:02:11.440 align:start position:0%
you know we do tie this
 
01:02:15.950 --> 01:02:15.960 align:start position:0%
into um getting rabies vaccinations and
 
01:02:18.190 --> 01:02:18.200 align:start position:0%
and that's important that everybody does
 
01:02:21.230 --> 01:02:21.240 align:start position:0%
that anybody have any other comments
 
01:02:23.349 --> 01:02:23.359 align:start position:0%
about it representative
 
01:02:27.390 --> 01:02:27.400 align:start position:0%
Bixby so um I think that the underlying
 
01:02:30.470 --> 01:02:30.480 align:start position:0%
bill in terms of repealing the uh the
 
01:02:33.870 --> 01:02:33.880 align:start position:0%
the license or changing the license uh
 
01:02:36.470 --> 01:02:36.480 align:start position:0%
frequency to for instance B anual which
 
01:02:39.750 --> 01:02:39.760 align:start position:0%
was a I believe a uh an amendment that
 
01:02:41.990 --> 01:02:42.000 align:start position:0%
had been proposed at some point I I
 
01:02:45.910 --> 01:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
think is inappropriate I think that uh I
 
01:02:48.829 --> 01:02:48.839 align:start position:0%
think that one of the over the years
 
01:02:52.990 --> 01:02:53.000 align:start position:0%
we've had various bills that try to uh
 
01:02:56.630 --> 01:02:56.640 align:start position:0%
amend the LIC cycle and we've had
 
01:02:58.670 --> 01:02:58.680 align:start position:0%
testimony from the state veterinarian
 
01:03:02.109 --> 01:03:02.119 align:start position:0%
that we do not want to mess around with
 
01:03:06.829 --> 01:03:06.839 align:start position:0%
um the insurance of Li of of vaccination
 
01:03:10.630 --> 01:03:10.640 align:start position:0%
that the licensing Pro um P the
 
01:03:15.029 --> 01:03:15.039 align:start position:0%
licensing system gives us uh rabies
 
01:03:19.309 --> 01:03:19.319 align:start position:0%
is when uh is is almost universally
 
01:03:23.390 --> 01:03:23.400 align:start position:0%
deadly in humans uh if it is not caught
 
01:03:27.870 --> 01:03:27.880 align:start position:0%
uh before symptoms begin to exhibit and
 
01:03:30.630 --> 01:03:30.640 align:start position:0%
I believe that um back several years ago
 
01:03:32.470 --> 01:03:32.480 align:start position:0%
Dr Crawford said there there was only
 
01:03:36.670 --> 01:03:36.680 align:start position:0%
one known um person who surviv who lived
 
01:03:39.789 --> 01:03:39.799 align:start position:0%
after Contracting rabies and that that
 
01:03:42.630 --> 01:03:42.640 align:start position:0%
person probably wished they were dead
 
01:03:45.829 --> 01:03:45.839 align:start position:0%
and so uh rabies is not something we
 
01:03:49.029 --> 01:03:49.039 align:start position:0%
want to mess around with the current
 
01:03:52.190 --> 01:03:52.200 align:start position:0%
system works very well uh I don't think
 
01:03:53.589 --> 01:03:53.599 align:start position:0%
that it makes any sense to try and
 
01:03:55.029 --> 01:03:55.039 align:start position:0%
change it
 
01:03:59.349 --> 01:03:59.359 align:start position:0%
uh in terms of the cost of $7 per year
 
01:04:02.349 --> 01:04:02.359 align:start position:0%
for a license fee that is substantially
 
01:04:04.390 --> 01:04:04.400 align:start position:0%
lower than many of our neighboring
 
01:04:08.309 --> 01:04:08.319 align:start position:0%
states uh and if you can't afford $7 a
 
01:04:10.950 --> 01:04:10.960 align:start position:0%
year for a license fee you don't you
 
01:04:13.950 --> 01:04:13.960 align:start position:0%
were not in a position to take care of a
 
01:04:16.510 --> 01:04:16.520 align:start position:0%
dog I mean that is less than a week's
 
01:04:17.750 --> 01:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
worth of
 
01:04:21.109 --> 01:04:21.119 align:start position:0%
food so and you know I also wanted to
 
01:04:24.269 --> 01:04:24.279 align:start position:0%
point out um we we had some testimony
 
01:04:26.910 --> 01:04:26.920 align:start position:0%
come in from uh Jay finy who used to
 
01:04:29.910 --> 01:04:29.920 align:start position:0%
chair this committee um and he had been
 
01:04:32.269 --> 01:04:32.279 align:start position:0%
talking about this bill with the aworth
 
01:04:32.279 --> 01:04:33.109 align:start position:0%
talking about this bill with the aworth
town

01:04:33.109 --> 01:04:33.119 align:start position:0%
town
 
01:04:36.470 --> 01:04:36.480 align:start position:0%
clerk um and and she felt that licensing
 
01:04:39.029 --> 01:04:39.039 align:start position:0%
serves a very valuable service when it
 
01:04:41.269 --> 01:04:41.279 align:start position:0%
comes to animal control and definitely
 
01:04:43.230 --> 01:04:43.240 align:start position:0%
has been a valuable tool for recovering
 
01:04:44.309 --> 01:04:44.319 align:start position:0%
a lost
 
01:04:49.190 --> 01:04:49.200 align:start position:0%
dog um so rabies tag and a dog tag
 
01:04:51.309 --> 01:04:51.319 align:start position:0%
they're not the same in fact where a dog
 
01:04:54.230 --> 01:04:54.240 align:start position:0%
has been licensed should it bite someone
 
01:04:55.990 --> 01:04:56.000 align:start position:0%
license will determine quickly whether
 
01:04:58.589 --> 01:04:58.599 align:start position:0%
or not that stray dog has been
 
01:05:00.589 --> 01:05:00.599 align:start position:0%
vaccinated for rabies so there's there
 
01:05:04.990 --> 01:05:05.000 align:start position:0%
really is a reason for these tags the
 
01:05:07.309 --> 01:05:07.319 align:start position:0%
rabies tags that the dogs
 
01:05:11.029 --> 01:05:11.039 align:start position:0%
wear um representative Morris you had
 
01:05:12.829 --> 01:05:12.839 align:start position:0%
something you wanted to say about this
 
01:05:16.430 --> 01:05:16.440 align:start position:0%
apologies for stepping out no worries I
 
01:05:17.789 --> 01:05:17.799 align:start position:0%
I I think we're all on the same page
 
01:05:19.470 --> 01:05:19.480 align:start position:0%
here I think that it's it's so important
 
01:05:21.269 --> 01:05:21.279 align:start position:0%
that we make sure the dogs are are
 
01:05:25.230 --> 01:05:25.240 align:start position:0%
registered and that we you know are of
 
01:05:28.789 --> 01:05:28.799 align:start position:0%
um what dogs have been vaccinated and so
 
01:05:30.710 --> 01:05:30.720 align:start position:0%
um I think kind of coming to a
 
01:05:32.390 --> 01:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
conclusion after hearing everyone else
 
01:05:33.670 --> 01:05:33.680 align:start position:0%
it sounds like we're all sort of on the
 
01:05:35.870 --> 01:05:35.880 align:start position:0%
same page I'm open to the possibility of
 
01:05:40.150 --> 01:05:40.160 align:start position:0%
of you know um discussing mailing out
 
01:05:42.430 --> 01:05:42.440 align:start position:0%
reminders for people or or that sort of
 
01:05:44.710 --> 01:05:44.720 align:start position:0%
thing but I think uh at the the end of
 
01:05:47.150 --> 01:05:47.160 align:start position:0%
the day um continuing to register dogs
 
01:05:49.670 --> 01:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
on a yearly basis for well and even the
 
01:05:52.269 --> 01:05:52.279 align:start position:0%
amendment um I know representative Hull
 
01:05:54.309 --> 01:05:54.319 align:start position:0%
had sent an amendment that would change
 
01:05:55.589 --> 01:05:55.599 align:start position:0%
this to be a
 
01:05:57.630 --> 01:05:57.640 align:start position:0%
banial um
 
01:06:00.349 --> 01:06:00.359 align:start position:0%
registration and I know what we had
 
01:06:03.589 --> 01:06:03.599 align:start position:0%
heard a bill in the past about that and
 
01:06:05.430 --> 01:06:05.440 align:start position:0%
the town clerks came out and said that
 
01:06:07.549 --> 01:06:07.559 align:start position:0%
would be terrible for them to manage
 
01:06:10.190 --> 01:06:10.200 align:start position:0%
because they can't it's easy if
 
01:06:11.950 --> 01:06:11.960 align:start position:0%
everybody has to register every year but
 
01:06:13.789 --> 01:06:13.799 align:start position:0%
if you have to register every other year
 
01:06:16.230 --> 01:06:16.240 align:start position:0%
and you're off cycle of when they're
 
01:06:18.510 --> 01:06:18.520 align:start position:0%
going to be getting their rabies shots
 
01:06:22.069 --> 01:06:22.079 align:start position:0%
then it makes it even more confusing um
 
01:06:24.190 --> 01:06:24.200 align:start position:0%
but if there's a lapse and and aemp
 
01:06:27.390 --> 01:06:27.400 align:start position:0%
clerk has to keep track of oh these dogs
 
01:06:29.710 --> 01:06:29.720 align:start position:0%
are uh coming up for Renewal this year
 
01:06:31.589 --> 01:06:31.599 align:start position:0%
and these dogs are coming up the next
 
01:06:33.990 --> 01:06:34.000 align:start position:0%
year or the year after it becomes too
 
01:06:37.470 --> 01:06:37.480 align:start position:0%
much of a um administrative um yeah and
 
01:06:39.029 --> 01:06:39.039 align:start position:0%
I nightmare to do that our town clerks
 
01:06:41.670 --> 01:06:41.680 align:start position:0%
are already working hard enough so
 
01:06:41.680 --> 01:06:42.789 align:start position:0%
are already working hard enough so
representative

01:06:42.789 --> 01:06:42.799 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:06:45.390 --> 01:06:45.400 align:start position:0%
NAB oh I'm sorry that it was Murray's
 
01:06:47.190 --> 01:06:47.200 align:start position:0%
hand it was up I'm sorry that's okay
 
01:06:50.109 --> 01:06:50.119 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um so yes I agree
 
01:06:52.950 --> 01:06:52.960 align:start position:0%
um as far as with regards to the town
 
01:06:56.390 --> 01:06:56.400 align:start position:0%
clerk's role and and um the ability to
 
01:06:58.990 --> 01:06:59.000 align:start position:0%
notify folks that their registration is
 
01:07:02.069 --> 01:07:02.079 align:start position:0%
up for Renewal while they also send uh
 
01:07:05.069 --> 01:07:05.079 align:start position:0%
paper not notice they they many Town
 
01:07:07.470 --> 01:07:07.480 align:start position:0%
clerks also send electronic notification
 
01:07:10.150 --> 01:07:10.160 align:start position:0%
that renewal is up therefore like saving
 
01:07:12.510 --> 01:07:12.520 align:start position:0%
costs of of postage in some ways um
 
01:07:17.390 --> 01:07:17.400 align:start position:0%
right so I to to just piggyback off of
 
01:07:19.470 --> 01:07:19.480 align:start position:0%
Representative mors I think we're widely
 
01:07:21.029 --> 01:07:21.039 align:start position:0%
in agreement
 
01:07:24.029 --> 01:07:24.039 align:start position:0%
here okay represent VI Bixby okay so in
 
01:07:26.069 --> 01:07:26.079 align:start position:0%
term in terms of the proposed amendment
 
01:07:28.710 --> 01:07:28.720 align:start position:0%
from representative Hobson to uh to
 
01:07:30.829 --> 01:07:30.839 align:start position:0%
raise the ra mailing reimbursement that
 
01:07:33.190 --> 01:07:33.200 align:start position:0%
is not for the regular notification that
 
01:07:36.349 --> 01:07:36.359 align:start position:0%
is for notification if someone is
 
01:07:40.309 --> 01:07:40.319 align:start position:0%
delinquent and they need to be um given
 
01:07:42.390 --> 01:07:42.400 align:start position:0%
a they need to be sent certified mail to
 
01:07:45.349 --> 01:07:45.359 align:start position:0%
make sure that they are uh that they
 
01:07:47.829 --> 01:07:47.839 align:start position:0%
know that they uh should come in and
 
01:07:50.549 --> 01:07:50.559 align:start position:0%
register their animal uh and I agree
 
01:07:53.750 --> 01:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
that that that those costs should be
 
01:07:55.430 --> 01:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
those that reimbursement rate should be
 
01:07:59.029 --> 01:07:59.039 align:start position:0%
raised to match what is uh currently
 
01:08:01.109 --> 01:08:01.119 align:start position:0%
appropriate but I don't think this is
 
01:08:03.309 --> 01:08:03.319 align:start position:0%
the bill to do that uh there is a bill
 
01:08:08.069 --> 01:08:08.079 align:start position:0%
that we passed um uh without in in
 
01:08:12.430 --> 01:08:12.440 align:start position:0%
barely the wink of an eye uh to um in to
 
01:08:15.950 --> 01:08:15.960 align:start position:0%
change where the dedicated where the
 
01:08:18.950 --> 01:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
which dedicated M money some of the dog
 
01:08:21.870 --> 01:08:21.880 align:start position:0%
license um which dedicated fund some of
 
01:08:25.149 --> 01:08:25.159 align:start position:0%
the dog license money goes to uh that
 
01:08:29.070 --> 01:08:29.080 align:start position:0%
and that that has gone to house finance
 
01:08:33.630 --> 01:08:33.640 align:start position:0%
uh or ways and mean no Ians means where
 
01:08:35.149 --> 01:08:35.159 align:start position:0%
it may have already passed there but
 
01:08:37.749 --> 01:08:37.759 align:start position:0%
that's that is going to be quickly
 
01:08:39.269 --> 01:08:39.279 align:start position:0%
passed by Ways and Means because it was
 
01:08:42.110 --> 01:08:42.120 align:start position:0%
a bill that they bipartisanly SP you
 
01:08:45.030 --> 01:08:45.040 align:start position:0%
know proposed right and that's going to
 
01:08:47.070 --> 01:08:47.080 align:start position:0%
go over to the Senate there's another
 
01:08:50.550 --> 01:08:50.560 align:start position:0%
issue in terms of making sure that uh
 
01:08:53.309 --> 01:08:53.319 align:start position:0%
reimbursement is um being done correctly
 
01:08:57.789 --> 01:08:57.799 align:start position:0%
which is that um the current span neuter
 
01:08:59.950 --> 01:08:59.960 align:start position:0%
uh reimbursement for veterinarians is
 
01:09:02.110 --> 01:09:02.120 align:start position:0%
not keeping up and we're losing
 
01:09:03.550 --> 01:09:03.560 align:start position:0%
veterinarians who are willing to
 
01:09:06.070 --> 01:09:06.080 align:start position:0%
participate in that program uh the
 
01:09:08.990 --> 01:09:09.000 align:start position:0%
Senate and uh and the commissioner have
 
01:09:11.229 --> 01:09:11.239 align:start position:0%
agreed to do an amendment on that I
 
01:09:12.910 --> 01:09:12.920 align:start position:0%
think that bill would be a very good
 
01:09:16.189 --> 01:09:16.199 align:start position:0%
place to also do an amendment to this
 
01:09:19.470 --> 01:09:19.480 align:start position:0%
notific the dog license not this
 
01:09:22.590 --> 01:09:22.600 align:start position:0%
notification uh mailing cost so I think
 
01:09:24.950 --> 01:09:24.960 align:start position:0%
it would be better for us to L this bill
 
01:09:29.030 --> 01:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
and recommend to the Senate that uh they
 
01:09:31.510 --> 01:09:31.520 align:start position:0%
um include the issue of the mail the
 
01:09:35.669 --> 01:09:35.679 align:start position:0%
certified mail to um to the to that bill
 
01:09:37.510 --> 01:09:37.520 align:start position:0%
that we've already
 
01:09:41.070 --> 01:09:41.080 align:start position:0%
passed yes and I've uh I've suggested
 
01:09:42.990 --> 01:09:43.000 align:start position:0%
that to representative Hobson and she's
 
01:09:44.990 --> 01:09:45.000 align:start position:0%
open to that as well so I mean she's
 
01:09:47.630 --> 01:09:47.640 align:start position:0%
just looking for a bill that she can get
 
01:09:49.749 --> 01:09:49.759 align:start position:0%
that Amendment passed to help out uh
 
01:09:52.630 --> 01:09:52.640 align:start position:0%
help solve that problem in not only her
 
01:09:55.550 --> 01:09:55.560 align:start position:0%
town but all across the state so um I
 
01:09:57.870 --> 01:09:57.880 align:start position:0%
will then be sending that recommendation
 
01:10:00.750 --> 01:10:00.760 align:start position:0%
to representative Hobson that um she
 
01:10:04.510 --> 01:10:04.520 align:start position:0%
speak to either Senator Pearl or Senator
 
01:10:06.990 --> 01:10:07.000 align:start position:0%
avard and make sure that that Amendment
 
01:10:10.510 --> 01:10:10.520 align:start position:0%
gets attached in the Senate any other
 
01:10:12.110 --> 01:10:12.120 align:start position:0%
questions or comments regarding this
 
01:10:12.120 --> 01:10:13.270 align:start position:0%
questions or comments regarding this
particular

01:10:13.270 --> 01:10:13.280 align:start position:0%
particular
 
01:10:16.830 --> 01:10:16.840 align:start position:0%
bill I mean otherwise I don't I don't
 
01:10:19.990 --> 01:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
see that it's prudent at all for us to
 
01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:20.950 align:start position:0%
see that it's prudent at all for us to
either

01:10:20.950 --> 01:10:20.960 align:start position:0%
either
 
01:10:24.270 --> 01:10:24.280 align:start position:0%
repeal uh dog licensing Reg registration
 
01:10:26.870 --> 01:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
annually or even make it banial or
 
01:10:32.590 --> 01:10:32.600 align:start position:0%
trianal so um any other comments to that
 
01:10:35.590 --> 01:10:35.600 align:start position:0%
effect seeing none I think we'll move on
 
01:10:37.870 --> 01:10:37.880 align:start position:0%
to um relative to exemptions from the
 
01:10:42.310 --> 01:10:42.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:45.390 --> 01:10:45.400 align:start position:0%
1556 uh anybody have any questions or
 
01:10:47.149 --> 01:10:47.159 align:start position:0%
comments about
 
01:10:51.390 --> 01:10:51.400 align:start position:0%
that I did send out an email to you all
 
01:10:54.110 --> 01:10:54.120 align:start position:0%
um with some uh feedback from from our
 
01:10:56.630 --> 01:10:56.640 align:start position:0%
state veterinarian Dr Crawford on the
 
01:10:59.790 --> 01:10:59.800 align:start position:0%
issue of uh
 
01:11:02.709 --> 01:11:02.719 align:start position:0%
exemptions and um I don't know I hope
 
01:11:04.149 --> 01:11:04.159 align:start position:0%
that you've all received it and that you
 
01:11:04.159 --> 01:11:04.950 align:start position:0%
that you've all received it and that you
read

01:11:04.950 --> 01:11:04.960 align:start position:0%
read
 
01:11:08.510 --> 01:11:08.520 align:start position:0%
it I think he makes some very Salient
 
01:11:12.430 --> 01:11:12.440 align:start position:0%
points um regarding
 
01:11:16.270 --> 01:11:16.280 align:start position:0%
that so I mean I I get it that um you
 
01:11:18.910 --> 01:11:18.920 align:start position:0%
know if you have an older animal that's
 
01:11:23.229 --> 01:11:23.239 align:start position:0%
sick um and is not able to be vaccinated
 
01:11:26.430 --> 01:11:26.440 align:start position:0%
that some of the quarantine protocol
 
01:11:29.750 --> 01:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
might be difficult but um there is
 
01:11:33.830 --> 01:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
latitude in the statute that um a person
 
01:11:36.590 --> 01:11:36.600 align:start position:0%
can work with their local animal control
 
01:11:36.600 --> 01:11:38.110 align:start position:0%
can work with their local animal control
officer

01:11:38.110 --> 01:11:38.120 align:start position:0%
officer
 
01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:39.870 align:start position:0%
officer
to

01:11:39.870 --> 01:11:39.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:11:43.830 --> 01:11:43.840 align:start position:0%
um maybe mitigate some of the issues
 
01:11:47.310 --> 01:11:47.320 align:start position:0%
that uh you have when you have a a dog
 
01:11:48.310 --> 01:11:48.320 align:start position:0%
in that
 
01:11:50.390 --> 01:11:50.400 align:start position:0%
situation representative
 
01:11:53.189 --> 01:11:53.199 align:start position:0%
kraton yes ma'am I guess where I fall on
 
01:11:55.709 --> 01:11:55.719 align:start position:0%
this is we got a a system where rabies
 
01:11:57.830 --> 01:11:57.840 align:start position:0%
is not a problem in this state it's not
 
01:11:59.430 --> 01:11:59.440 align:start position:0%
a problem because we pass certain laws
 
01:12:02.149 --> 01:12:02.159 align:start position:0%
that prevent it from happening why would
 
01:12:05.750 --> 01:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
we screw with that so I'm on it on this
 
01:12:10.229 --> 01:12:10.239 align:start position:0%
okay represent suffi is just as a nurse
 
01:12:12.189 --> 01:12:12.199 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to throw this out there
 
01:12:15.550 --> 01:12:15.560 align:start position:0%
that um all animals from the tiniest
 
01:12:17.790 --> 01:12:17.800 align:start position:0%
little animal to a big horse they all
 
01:12:22.110 --> 01:12:22.120 align:start position:0%
get the same dose and um that one was a
 
01:12:25.510 --> 01:12:25.520 align:start position:0%
hard one for me being because in in um
 
01:12:27.790 --> 01:12:27.800 align:start position:0%
human health care a lot of these drugs
 
01:12:31.310 --> 01:12:31.320 align:start position:0%
are weight specific and so for me that I
 
01:12:34.430 --> 01:12:34.440 align:start position:0%
have 200 PB dogs to think that a little
 
01:12:36.669 --> 01:12:36.679 align:start position:0%
Chihuahua is going to get the same
 
01:12:40.189 --> 01:12:40.199 align:start position:0%
dosage that my huge dogs are it just it
 
01:12:42.669 --> 01:12:42.679 align:start position:0%
sort of doesn't fly scientifically for
 
01:12:46.950 --> 01:12:46.960 align:start position:0%
me and um rabies titer are something
 
01:12:48.590 --> 01:12:48.600 align:start position:0%
that I'm sure that we're going to hear
 
01:12:52.910 --> 01:12:52.920 align:start position:0%
more I had submitted a bill years ago um
 
01:12:55.669 --> 01:12:55.679 align:start position:0%
and it never never got anywhere but the
 
01:13:00.110 --> 01:13:00.120 align:start position:0%
same people are um in Kansas University
 
01:13:02.390 --> 01:13:02.400 align:start position:0%
they're the ones that are doing the all
 
01:13:04.910 --> 01:13:04.920 align:start position:0%
the research on rabies titer and what it
 
01:13:07.030 --> 01:13:07.040 align:start position:0%
means and
 
01:13:11.110 --> 01:13:11.120 align:start position:0%
um one of my dog whisperers um St
 
01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:12.110 align:start position:0%
um one of my dog whisperers um St
Bernard

01:13:12.110 --> 01:13:12.120 align:start position:0%
Bernard
 
01:13:16.310 --> 01:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
dogs has an autoimmune disease and they
 
01:13:20.270 --> 01:13:20.280 align:start position:0%
had a titer done on his dog on her dog
 
01:13:23.870 --> 01:13:23.880 align:start position:0%
and um showed that he was
 
01:13:27.830 --> 01:13:27.840 align:start position:0%
he had enough of the arabes um vaccine
 
01:13:31.629 --> 01:13:31.639 align:start position:0%
in him to last for seven years so it's a
 
01:13:34.070 --> 01:13:34.080 align:start position:0%
funny thing but I think that the science
 
01:13:35.790 --> 01:13:35.800 align:start position:0%
is something to keep an eye on the
 
01:13:39.070 --> 01:13:39.080 align:start position:0%
science is going to come around to to
 
01:13:41.750 --> 01:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
this absolutely and I I remember the
 
01:13:44.669 --> 01:13:44.679 align:start position:0%
discussions we had about um exemptions
 
01:13:47.629 --> 01:13:47.639 align:start position:0%
uh circling around the uh rabies vaccine
 
01:13:50.629 --> 01:13:50.639 align:start position:0%
titer and that the issue was that there
 
01:13:53.390 --> 01:13:53.400 align:start position:0%
was the tests were not standard enough
 
01:13:55.430 --> 01:13:55.440 align:start position:0%
enough that if you sent blood work to
 
01:13:58.390 --> 01:13:58.400 align:start position:0%
one lab and blood work to another lab
 
01:13:59.870 --> 01:13:59.880 align:start position:0%
there was possible you could get two
 
01:14:03.550 --> 01:14:03.560 align:start position:0%
different results and so until the time
 
01:14:08.830 --> 01:14:08.840 align:start position:0%
that they get the rabies tighter um
 
01:14:14.070 --> 01:14:14.080 align:start position:0%
testing standardized and really accurate
 
01:14:15.830 --> 01:14:15.840 align:start position:0%
uh I don't think that we're going to see
 
01:14:19.149 --> 01:14:19.159 align:start position:0%
any kind of exemptions um you know from
 
01:14:21.950 --> 01:14:21.960 align:start position:0%
that but in dealing with this particular
 
01:14:25.510 --> 01:14:25.520 align:start position:0%
issue uh you have an older sicker dog or
 
01:14:27.910 --> 01:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
something like that to give any other
 
01:14:31.430 --> 01:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
further exemption than we already give
 
01:14:34.990 --> 01:14:35.000 align:start position:0%
um is uh could be problematic I think
 
01:14:38.629 --> 01:14:38.639 align:start position:0%
and and dangerous represent Bixby yeah
 
01:14:45.510 --> 01:14:45.520 align:start position:0%
so um I think the uh yeah um I I'm I
 
01:14:47.790 --> 01:14:47.800 align:start position:0%
think that what Dr Crawford said about
 
01:14:52.350 --> 01:14:52.360 align:start position:0%
this being a um this being this Le this
 
01:14:54.709 --> 01:14:54.719 align:start position:0%
statute being good as it currently
 
01:14:58.030 --> 01:14:58.040 align:start position:0%
stands is um is really important I think
 
01:15:00.750 --> 01:15:00.760 align:start position:0%
that the fact that there is that ability
 
01:15:02.790 --> 01:15:02.800 align:start position:0%
for a dog owner to work individually
 
01:15:05.229 --> 01:15:05.239 align:start position:0%
with the with local animal control is
 
01:15:08.470 --> 01:15:08.480 align:start position:0%
critical but I think that is also uh as
 
01:15:10.830 --> 01:15:10.840 align:start position:0%
representative kraton pointed out the
 
01:15:12.990 --> 01:15:13.000 align:start position:0%
reason that we don't have a ra rabies
 
01:15:15.030 --> 01:15:15.040 align:start position:0%
problem in New Hampshire and in fact in
 
01:15:20.270 --> 01:15:20.280 align:start position:0%
in our entire country is because we have
 
01:15:23.950 --> 01:15:23.960 align:start position:0%
very good vaccination programs for our
 
01:15:28.870 --> 01:15:28.880 align:start position:0%
domestic animals and uh the the
 
01:15:32.110 --> 01:15:32.120 align:start position:0%
countries that don't have this the qu
 
01:15:35.470 --> 01:15:35.480 align:start position:0%
the level of vaccination that for rabies
 
01:15:36.350 --> 01:15:36.360 align:start position:0%
that we
 
01:15:39.950 --> 01:15:39.960 align:start position:0%
do do have problems with people dying of
 
01:15:43.750 --> 01:15:43.760 align:start position:0%
rabies there are very very few deaths
 
01:15:46.830 --> 01:15:46.840 align:start position:0%
from rabies in the United States or
 
01:15:50.149 --> 01:15:50.159 align:start position:0%
Canada uh because we they these
 
01:15:52.470 --> 01:15:52.480 align:start position:0%
countries have excellent vaccination
 
01:15:52.480 --> 01:15:53.750 align:start position:0%
countries have excellent vaccination
rates

01:15:53.750 --> 01:15:53.760 align:start position:0%
rates
 
01:15:56.750 --> 01:15:56.760 align:start position:0%
um just one of one of the things about
 
01:16:00.910 --> 01:16:00.920 align:start position:0%
the biology of the vaccine uh vaccines
 
01:16:04.189 --> 01:16:04.199 align:start position:0%
don't have the same sort of uh dose
 
01:16:07.550 --> 01:16:07.560 align:start position:0%
characteristics that ordinary drugs do
 
01:16:09.590 --> 01:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
uh it is sufficient to just to have a
 
01:16:13.830 --> 01:16:13.840 align:start position:0%
very small amount of the uh antigen in
 
01:16:15.830 --> 01:16:15.840 align:start position:0%
the system so that the immune system
 
01:16:18.870 --> 01:16:18.880 align:start position:0%
will recognize it and develop antibodies
 
01:16:21.270 --> 01:16:21.280 align:start position:0%
uh it's not that you're
 
01:16:24.830 --> 01:16:24.840 align:start position:0%
giving uh a a tiny dog the same dose as
 
01:16:28.430 --> 01:16:28.440 align:start position:0%
you're giving a big dog it's that a what
 
01:16:31.149 --> 01:16:31.159 align:start position:0%
is sufficient for a tiny dog is also
 
01:16:36.030 --> 01:16:36.040 align:start position:0%
sufficient for a very big dog uh so um
 
01:16:39.430 --> 01:16:39.440 align:start position:0%
so the uh and as representative eron
 
01:16:43.590 --> 01:16:43.600 align:start position:0%
pointed out uh the although there is uh
 
01:16:47.270 --> 01:16:47.280 align:start position:0%
work being done on titer uh the way that
 
01:16:49.830 --> 01:16:49.840 align:start position:0%
the consistency of the testing and the
 
01:16:53.149 --> 01:16:53.159 align:start position:0%
way that that's interpreted uh is still
 
01:16:55.430 --> 01:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
not solid enough to convince our state
 
01:16:57.510 --> 01:16:57.520 align:start position:0%
vet that it's ready to go and I think
 
01:17:01.149 --> 01:17:01.159 align:start position:0%
that our state vet is really on top of
 
01:17:03.510 --> 01:17:03.520 align:start position:0%
controlling animal anal animal disease
 
01:17:05.149 --> 01:17:05.159 align:start position:0%
in the state so I really trusted
 
01:17:06.790 --> 01:17:06.800 align:start position:0%
judgment on
 
01:17:10.910 --> 01:17:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:13.390 --> 01:17:13.400 align:start position:0%
Penza so my question is kind of to
 
01:17:15.629 --> 01:17:15.639 align:start position:0%
piggyback on what representative uh sopi
 
01:17:20.110 --> 01:17:20.120 align:start position:0%
Kus um spoke about so I I not I don't
 
01:17:22.189 --> 01:17:22.199 align:start position:0%
have a dog but and I don't have a lot of
 
01:17:23.830 --> 01:17:23.840 align:start position:0%
knowledge but I've heard about titer now
 
01:17:26.629 --> 01:17:26.639 align:start position:0%
for quite some time so how far away are
 
01:17:28.470 --> 01:17:28.480 align:start position:0%
we I know that you followed up and said
 
01:17:30.750 --> 01:17:30.760 align:start position:0%
that we're you know it's you could go in
 
01:17:32.669 --> 01:17:32.679 align:start position:0%
one lab and it's this and another lab
 
01:17:35.149 --> 01:17:35.159 align:start position:0%
but you said you put in a bill years ago
 
01:17:37.870 --> 01:17:37.880 align:start position:0%
about this I mean I would see with
 
01:17:39.629 --> 01:17:39.639 align:start position:0%
science and technology at this point
 
01:17:41.390 --> 01:17:41.400 align:start position:0%
aren't we close because I know that
 
01:17:43.189 --> 01:17:43.199 align:start position:0%
there's certain states that are using it
 
01:17:46.070 --> 01:17:46.080 align:start position:0%
right now so I'm kind of um I'm just you
 
01:17:48.070 --> 01:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
know my question is where where where we
 
01:17:49.350 --> 01:17:49.360 align:start position:0%
at I've heard that we're a couple of
 
01:17:52.310 --> 01:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
years away okay two three years away
 
01:17:55.030 --> 01:17:55.040 align:start position:0%
okay I I don't know I mean it depends
 
01:17:56.669 --> 01:17:56.679 align:start position:0%
who you talk to I
 
01:18:01.430 --> 01:18:01.440 align:start position:0%
guess represent suus I think that it's
 
01:18:04.270 --> 01:18:04.280 align:start position:0%
something as uh representative kraton
 
01:18:08.030 --> 01:18:08.040 align:start position:0%
said we don't have a problem now and so
 
01:18:11.270 --> 01:18:11.280 align:start position:0%
people are firm in that we don't have a
 
01:18:13.390 --> 01:18:13.400 align:start position:0%
problem now and so it's budding up
 
01:18:17.270 --> 01:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
against that because as a nurse in
 
01:18:21.110 --> 01:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
Boston and a neuroscience nurse I saw we
 
01:18:23.830 --> 01:18:23.840 align:start position:0%
had a patient that had rabies
 
01:18:26.870 --> 01:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
and um it's horrible it's the worst
 
01:18:31.709 --> 01:18:31.719 align:start position:0%
thing you ever saw and I myself um was
 
01:18:34.310 --> 01:18:34.320 align:start position:0%
bitten by a cat when we were living in
 
01:18:37.470 --> 01:18:37.480 align:start position:0%
Guam and the cat was froing at the mouth
 
01:18:41.790 --> 01:18:41.800 align:start position:0%
and um it died with his teeth in my hand
 
01:18:44.070 --> 01:18:44.080 align:start position:0%
and so they took the head and they had
 
01:18:48.270 --> 01:18:48.280 align:start position:0%
to send it to the CDC in Atlanta but in
 
01:18:50.669 --> 01:18:50.679 align:start position:0%
that meantime till they could find out
 
01:18:52.350 --> 01:18:52.360 align:start position:0%
what was wrong with the cat I had to
 
01:18:56.070 --> 01:18:56.080 align:start position:0%
have the r baby shots and um it's not
 
01:18:58.070 --> 01:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
like it was a big deal but everybody was
 
01:19:00.350 --> 01:19:00.360 align:start position:0%
making it like it was a big deal to me I
 
01:19:05.270 --> 01:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
was like maybe 15 but I um it's nothing
 
01:19:07.350 --> 01:19:07.360 align:start position:0%
to fool around with but people are
 
01:19:07.360 --> 01:19:08.950 align:start position:0%
to fool around with but people are
concerned

01:19:08.950 --> 01:19:08.960 align:start position:0%
concerned
 
01:19:13.430 --> 01:19:13.440 align:start position:0%
because it's um all of the doses come
 
01:19:17.030 --> 01:19:17.040 align:start position:0%
packaged the same and so even if they
 
01:19:18.310 --> 01:19:18.320 align:start position:0%
tried to
 
01:19:21.390 --> 01:19:21.400 align:start position:0%
make the one of the testimonies the
 
01:19:23.950 --> 01:19:23.960 align:start position:0%
doctor said and that's why when they
 
01:19:25.830 --> 01:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
called me afterwards and asked why they
 
01:19:28.229 --> 01:19:28.239 align:start position:0%
didn't get a better reception because
 
01:19:31.030 --> 01:19:31.040 align:start position:0%
the doctor kept saying that well he
 
01:19:32.750 --> 01:19:32.760 align:start position:0%
would write that he gave the dose but he
 
01:19:35.870 --> 01:19:35.880 align:start position:0%
gave the weight specific dose and so it
 
01:19:38.550 --> 01:19:38.560 align:start position:0%
was just a practice issue and I um I
 
01:19:40.110 --> 01:19:40.120 align:start position:0%
can't deal with that as a nurse you
 
01:19:43.310 --> 01:19:43.320 align:start position:0%
don't get to do things like that and so
 
01:19:45.470 --> 01:19:45.480 align:start position:0%
I was very upset with him because I
 
01:19:48.110 --> 01:19:48.120 align:start position:0%
think that this is a thing that it it's
 
01:19:50.910 --> 01:19:50.920 align:start position:0%
time will come you know that we have
 
01:19:53.550 --> 01:19:53.560 align:start position:0%
science and people will
 
01:19:56.189 --> 01:19:56.199 align:start position:0%
understand the science and and then I
 
01:19:57.830 --> 01:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
think that's when it will change but
 
01:19:59.709 --> 01:19:59.719 align:start position:0%
it's going to be a slow thing
 
01:20:01.830 --> 01:20:01.840 align:start position:0%
because the
 
01:20:06.110 --> 01:20:06.120 align:start position:0%
downside is so awful and I pray that it
 
01:20:08.350 --> 01:20:08.360 align:start position:0%
never happens to anybody that we know
 
01:20:11.390 --> 01:20:11.400 align:start position:0%
and love because it's the most awful
 
01:20:13.910 --> 01:20:13.920 align:start position:0%
thing and there's no coming back from
 
01:20:17.990 --> 01:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
it y now in this bill it says um it
 
01:20:20.910 --> 01:20:20.920 align:start position:0%
strikes out the line from statute that
 
01:20:22.390 --> 01:20:22.400 align:start position:0%
says in addition when the animal is
 
01:20:24.830 --> 01:20:24.840 align:start position:0%
outdo doors it shall be muzzled in a
 
01:20:26.590 --> 01:20:26.600 align:start position:0%
manner approved by the local rabies
 
01:20:29.189 --> 01:20:29.199 align:start position:0%
control Authority and I for me that's
 
01:20:31.030 --> 01:20:31.040 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
01:20:34.229 --> 01:20:34.239 align:start position:0%
um unsettling because we all do know
 
01:20:37.669 --> 01:20:37.679 align:start position:0%
that uh dogs tend to get out from the
 
01:20:40.550 --> 01:20:40.560 align:start position:0%
gate or you know jump the gate or if
 
01:20:42.030 --> 01:20:42.040 align:start position:0%
they see something they're going to run
 
01:20:46.189 --> 01:20:46.199 align:start position:0%
off and um you know musling is a tool
 
01:20:48.830 --> 01:20:48.840 align:start position:0%
and I think that that's not a tool that
 
01:20:51.709 --> 01:20:51.719 align:start position:0%
needs to be given up
 
01:20:54.629 --> 01:20:54.639 align:start position:0%
um representative
 
01:20:59.030 --> 01:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
smart um I I just would like to say that
 
01:21:02.189 --> 01:21:02.199 align:start position:0%
um probably about 15 or 20 years ago we
 
01:21:04.430 --> 01:21:04.440 align:start position:0%
had an outbreak of rabies in the state
 
01:21:08.030 --> 01:21:08.040 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire was pretty bad um in
 
01:21:09.950 --> 01:21:09.960 align:start position:0%
the wild animal population and it did
 
01:21:12.950 --> 01:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
not affect the domestic animals because
 
01:21:16.270 --> 01:21:16.280 align:start position:0%
we vaccinate so I you know vaccinations
 
01:21:19.149 --> 01:21:19.159 align:start position:0%
are very important whether it's um
 
01:21:23.229 --> 01:21:23.239 align:start position:0%
dosage or however you want to look at it
 
01:21:27.270 --> 01:21:27.280 align:start position:0%
also um a lot of there's a lot of
 
01:21:30.270 --> 01:21:30.280 align:start position:0%
Manufacturers that make vaccines Rees
 
01:21:32.750 --> 01:21:32.760 align:start position:0%
vaccines other vaccines and each
 
01:21:36.229 --> 01:21:36.239 align:start position:0%
manufacturer has its own adant that it
 
01:21:39.510 --> 01:21:39.520 align:start position:0%
mixes um to make it solu solvent so you
 
01:21:41.430 --> 01:21:41.440 align:start position:0%
can give it as a
 
01:21:44.030 --> 01:21:44.040 align:start position:0%
vaccine different animals just like
 
01:21:45.470 --> 01:21:45.480 align:start position:0%
different people have different
 
01:21:49.229 --> 01:21:49.239 align:start position:0%
reactions to different adant and so it
 
01:21:52.310 --> 01:21:52.320 align:start position:0%
could be an adant issue when you have an
 
01:21:55.750 --> 01:21:55.760 align:start position:0%
animal that's having a reaction so maybe
 
01:21:59.310 --> 01:21:59.320 align:start position:0%
not the rabies vaccine itself the rabies
 
01:22:01.669 --> 01:22:01.679 align:start position:0%
part of the vaccine but maybe the adant
 
01:22:03.910 --> 01:22:03.920 align:start position:0%
part and maybe a different manufacturer
 
01:22:07.310 --> 01:22:07.320 align:start position:0%
might be the way to go for
 
01:22:11.830 --> 01:22:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:14.030 --> 01:22:14.040 align:start position:0%
Penza being new on the committee and I
 
01:22:16.390 --> 01:22:16.400 align:start position:0%
know that this is um these bills have
 
01:22:19.270 --> 01:22:19.280 align:start position:0%
come forward over the years uh I just I
 
01:22:21.669 --> 01:22:21.679 align:start position:0%
guess I'm kind of trying to understand
 
01:22:23.189 --> 01:22:23.199 align:start position:0%
is there
 
01:22:25.229 --> 01:22:25.239 align:start position:0%
is there an entity that's actually
 
01:22:27.990 --> 01:22:28.000 align:start position:0%
really policing this like I mean do we
 
01:22:30.709 --> 01:22:30.719 align:start position:0%
really need to strike out muzzle because
 
01:22:32.350 --> 01:22:32.360 align:start position:0%
you're going to have someone that is
 
01:22:34.390 --> 01:22:34.400 align:start position:0%
going to be like oh my gosh that dog on
 
01:22:37.910 --> 01:22:37.920 align:start position:0%
you know 195 Smith Lane doesn't have a
 
01:22:40.470 --> 01:22:40.480 align:start position:0%
rabies vaccine and it's not muzzled like
 
01:22:42.390 --> 01:22:42.400 align:start position:0%
is that really
 
01:22:45.790 --> 01:22:45.800 align:start position:0%
happening it's hard to say I mean we do
 
01:22:49.669 --> 01:22:49.679 align:start position:0%
have Animal Control Officers who are
 
01:22:53.070 --> 01:22:53.080 align:start position:0%
aware of dogs in their area who
 
01:22:55.709 --> 01:22:55.719 align:start position:0%
have the exemptions and from what I
 
01:23:00.709 --> 01:23:00.719 align:start position:0%
understand um let's see
 
01:23:04.750 --> 01:23:04.760 align:start position:0%
um Dr Crawford I had asked him how many
 
01:23:06.750 --> 01:23:06.760 align:start position:0%
dogs currently have rabies exemptions in
 
01:23:10.590 --> 01:23:10.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and when he ran last ran
 
01:23:14.950 --> 01:23:14.960 align:start position:0%
the data March 2023 there had been 1628
 
01:23:17.750 --> 01:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
exemptions issued in the 15 years since
 
01:23:20.229 --> 01:23:20.239 align:start position:0%
the exemption process was implemented
 
01:23:22.030 --> 01:23:22.040 align:start position:0%
some number of those were repeats from
 
01:23:25.870 --> 01:23:25.880 align:start position:0%
prior years um but that means it there
 
01:23:28.590 --> 01:23:28.600 align:start position:0%
would be at least 110 exempt dogs and
 
01:23:30.629 --> 01:23:30.639 align:start position:0%
cats in New Hampshire based on
 
01:23:33.390 --> 01:23:33.400 align:start position:0%
legislative changes last year they don't
 
01:23:35.310 --> 01:23:35.320 align:start position:0%
get involved with the renewal process as
 
01:23:38.830 --> 01:23:38.840 align:start position:0%
much um so you know there are dogs that
 
01:23:43.189 --> 01:23:43.199 align:start position:0%
we are aware of that for one reason or
 
01:23:47.950 --> 01:23:47.960 align:start position:0%
another um don't don't react well to the
 
01:23:50.470 --> 01:23:50.480 align:start position:0%
rabies vaccination so they have an
 
01:23:52.830 --> 01:23:52.840 align:start position:0%
exemption and I think the animal Control
 
01:23:55.270 --> 01:23:55.280 align:start position:0%
Officers in those areas are aware of who
 
01:23:57.870 --> 01:23:57.880 align:start position:0%
those are do they go to these people's
 
01:23:59.790 --> 01:23:59.800 align:start position:0%
houses every day and make sure that
 
01:24:02.149 --> 01:24:02.159 align:start position:0%
they're muzzled and that they're in
 
01:24:07.110 --> 01:24:07.120 align:start position:0%
isolation probably not but seeing as um
 
01:24:09.390 --> 01:24:09.400 align:start position:0%
you know we have a protocol in place and
 
01:24:11.830 --> 01:24:11.840 align:start position:0%
statute I think that that that makes a
 
01:24:14.790 --> 01:24:14.800 align:start position:0%
statement and many people will take that
 
01:24:17.590 --> 01:24:17.600 align:start position:0%
pretty seriously I agree yeah
 
01:24:17.600 --> 01:24:18.870 align:start position:0%
pretty seriously I agree yeah
representative

01:24:18.870 --> 01:24:18.880 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:24:22.030 --> 01:24:22.040 align:start position:0%
Katon yes ma' and that's a a great
 
01:24:24.470 --> 01:24:24.480 align:start position:0%
question represent potenti I would flip
 
01:24:27.629 --> 01:24:27.639 align:start position:0%
it to the other way from a if something
 
01:24:30.990 --> 01:24:31.000 align:start position:0%
does happen and say your dog does get a
 
01:24:33.550 --> 01:24:33.560 align:start position:0%
an exemption and the BET says okay well
 
01:24:34.870 --> 01:24:34.880 align:start position:0%
if your dog's outside you got to have a
 
01:24:37.189 --> 01:24:37.199 align:start position:0%
muzzle on it okay it's up to you to do
 
01:24:40.070 --> 01:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
that but if the dog does get away and it
 
01:24:42.030 --> 01:24:42.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a muzzle on it then the
 
01:24:44.790 --> 01:24:44.800 align:start position:0%
state has a recourse because you were
 
01:24:46.709 --> 01:24:46.719 align:start position:0%
told to get this exemption these are the
 
01:24:49.870 --> 01:24:49.880 align:start position:0%
rules you fail to follow the rules that
 
01:24:51.510 --> 01:24:51.520 align:start position:0%
so rather than someone looking in
 
01:24:55.149 --> 01:24:55.159 align:start position:0%
someone's backyard for this dog it's if
 
01:24:57.270 --> 01:24:57.280 align:start position:0%
you violate it and something does happen
 
01:24:59.350 --> 01:24:59.360 align:start position:0%
then then we have something to to fall
 
01:25:02.189 --> 01:25:02.199 align:start position:0%
back on and I I think that's fine so
 
01:25:04.709 --> 01:25:04.719 align:start position:0%
representative kto thank you actually uh
 
01:25:06.430 --> 01:25:06.440 align:start position:0%
representative kraton basically said the
 
01:25:09.510 --> 01:25:09.520 align:start position:0%
same thing uh I was going to speak to
 
01:25:13.709 --> 01:25:13.719 align:start position:0%
Yes um because as a dog owner I know
 
01:25:16.149 --> 01:25:16.159 align:start position:0%
that when my rabies are due it's one of
 
01:25:18.430 --> 01:25:18.440 align:start position:0%
the things that I'm adamant about
 
01:25:20.990 --> 01:25:21.000 align:start position:0%
because if my dogs get Loose as they
 
01:25:23.830 --> 01:25:23.840 align:start position:0%
sometimes do CH going after whatever
 
01:25:26.990 --> 01:25:27.000 align:start position:0%
they see in the woods um the fear for me
 
01:25:28.950 --> 01:25:28.960 align:start position:0%
is if they ever bit somebody and they
 
01:25:30.790 --> 01:25:30.800 align:start position:0%
weren't up to date on their
 
01:25:33.270 --> 01:25:33.280 align:start position:0%
Ries I mean I could be
 
01:25:37.910 --> 01:25:37.920 align:start position:0%
liable uh and it would affect my entire
 
01:25:40.870 --> 01:25:40.880 align:start position:0%
you know everything so I think anybody
 
01:25:42.790 --> 01:25:42.800 align:start position:0%
that's a responsible dog owner who has
 
01:25:45.310 --> 01:25:45.320 align:start position:0%
an exemption will be following the law
 
01:25:46.669 --> 01:25:46.679 align:start position:0%
just knowing
 
01:25:49.189 --> 01:25:49.199 align:start position:0%
that representive Murray uh thank you
 
01:25:50.750 --> 01:25:50.760 align:start position:0%
madam chair I also think it's important
 
01:25:54.070 --> 01:25:54.080 align:start position:0%
to note that in this conversation about
 
01:25:56.870 --> 01:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
uh rabies exposure and musling whether
 
01:25:59.430 --> 01:25:59.440 align:start position:0%
it's an exempt animal or not there are
 
01:26:01.590 --> 01:26:01.600 align:start position:0%
circumstances in which animals are fully
 
01:26:04.669 --> 01:26:04.679 align:start position:0%
vaccinated for rabies have encountered
 
01:26:06.990 --> 01:26:07.000 align:start position:0%
an animal that's suspected to be rabid
 
01:26:08.709 --> 01:26:08.719 align:start position:0%
and is placed in quarantine and the
 
01:26:11.590 --> 01:26:11.600 align:start position:0%
muzzle requirement is there as well so I
 
01:26:14.030 --> 01:26:14.040 align:start position:0%
would just you know remind folks that I
 
01:26:16.030 --> 01:26:16.040 align:start position:0%
think we're all again on the same page
 
01:26:18.350 --> 01:26:18.360 align:start position:0%
here but there are other circumstances
 
01:26:22.790 --> 01:26:22.800 align:start position:0%
in which um that is an appropriate um
 
01:26:26.430 --> 01:26:26.440 align:start position:0%
set of uh circumstances that requires
 
01:26:29.750 --> 01:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
it representative Howard thank you madam
 
01:26:31.950 --> 01:26:31.960 align:start position:0%
chair I just wanted to um regarding the
 
01:26:34.390 --> 01:26:34.400 align:start position:0%
the um the rabies outbreak of several
 
01:26:35.870 --> 01:26:35.880 align:start position:0%
years ago I just wanted to commend the
 
01:26:38.070 --> 01:26:38.080 align:start position:0%
committee for um for not making it so
 
01:26:39.709 --> 01:26:39.719 align:start position:0%
that raccoons can't be pets because they
 
01:26:42.669 --> 01:26:42.679 align:start position:0%
were the big purveyors of the the r
 
01:26:42.679 --> 01:26:44.310 align:start position:0%
were the big purveyors of the the r
episode

01:26:44.310 --> 01:26:44.320 align:start position:0%
episode
 
01:26:47.669 --> 01:26:47.679 align:start position:0%
before okay any further discussion I
 
01:26:51.229 --> 01:26:51.239 align:start position:0%
think um I think we're pretty much um on
 
01:26:55.310 --> 01:26:55.320 align:start position:0%
the same page with with that bill and um
 
01:26:56.709 --> 01:26:56.719 align:start position:0%
you know while
 
01:27:01.189 --> 01:27:01.199 align:start position:0%
I have some compassion for the issue of
 
01:27:03.990 --> 01:27:04.000 align:start position:0%
uh you know having an older dog that's
 
01:27:05.910 --> 01:27:05.920 align:start position:0%
sick and maybe you can't you have
 
01:27:07.709 --> 01:27:07.719 align:start position:0%
trouble keeping a muzzle on them because
 
01:27:09.669 --> 01:27:09.679 align:start position:0%
they're vomiting because of their
 
01:27:12.229 --> 01:27:12.239 align:start position:0%
illnesses or whatever um you know I
 
01:27:14.669 --> 01:27:14.679 align:start position:0%
think there's there's a a bit of
 
01:27:16.510 --> 01:27:16.520 align:start position:0%
discretion here you work with your
 
01:27:19.470 --> 01:27:19.480 align:start position:0%
Animal control officer on on how to
 
01:27:21.430 --> 01:27:21.440 align:start position:0%
manage that properly within the
 
01:27:23.270 --> 01:27:23.280 align:start position:0%
guidelines and
 
01:27:24.950 --> 01:27:24.960 align:start position:0%
I I don't think that there's a you know
 
01:27:27.910 --> 01:27:27.920 align:start position:0%
a need to strike out all of this uh
 
01:27:31.070 --> 01:27:31.080 align:start position:0%
stuff from our from our current law so
 
01:27:32.950 --> 01:27:32.960 align:start position:0%
that's kind of where I am with
 
01:27:35.590 --> 01:27:35.600 align:start position:0%
that and uh the last bill that we wanted
 
01:27:37.590 --> 01:27:37.600 align:start position:0%
to talk about uh that we heard in
 
01:27:39.790 --> 01:27:39.800 align:start position:0%
committee is uh the architectural paint
 
01:27:42.109 --> 01:27:42.119 align:start position:0%
recycling bill which is
 
01:27:44.750 --> 01:27:44.760 align:start position:0%
hp504 and I invite representative Murray
 
01:27:47.229 --> 01:27:47.239 align:start position:0%
to talk about that thank you madam chair
 
01:27:49.790 --> 01:27:49.800 align:start position:0%
this is a concept that I think um while
 
01:27:51.229 --> 01:27:51.239 align:start position:0%
I can't speak for other members I'm
 
01:27:52.870 --> 01:27:52.880 align:start position:0%
actually really excited excited to see
 
01:27:54.990 --> 01:27:55.000 align:start position:0%
this before our committee um for a
 
01:27:56.550 --> 01:27:56.560 align:start position:0%
couple of reasons I know that my
 
01:27:58.990 --> 01:27:59.000 align:start position:0%
wheelhouse has sort of been Solid Waste
 
01:28:01.109 --> 01:28:01.119 align:start position:0%
Management and also then this the
 
01:28:03.950 --> 01:28:03.960 align:start position:0%
conversation around um paint recycling
 
01:28:06.350 --> 01:28:06.360 align:start position:0%
um and we know that there is a
 
01:28:09.510 --> 01:28:09.520 align:start position:0%
significant portion of paint AR
 
01:28:11.109 --> 01:28:11.119 align:start position:0%
architectural paint that is making its
 
01:28:14.950 --> 01:28:14.960 align:start position:0%
way into landfilling uh landfills and um
 
01:28:17.070 --> 01:28:17.080 align:start position:0%
some best practice methods that I think
 
01:28:19.709 --> 01:28:19.719 align:start position:0%
are starting to be more widely accepted
 
01:28:22.709 --> 01:28:22.719 align:start position:0%
as an maybe uh less preferable
 
01:28:25.629 --> 01:28:25.639 align:start position:0%
um disposal method is is dumping it into
 
01:28:27.430 --> 01:28:27.440 align:start position:0%
kitty litter and adding weight to our
 
01:28:30.270 --> 01:28:30.280 align:start position:0%
tonnage and our land filling so this
 
01:28:32.550 --> 01:28:32.560 align:start position:0%
program would really be an opportunity
 
01:28:37.510 --> 01:28:37.520 align:start position:0%
to sort of stand up uh another um
 
01:28:40.350 --> 01:28:40.360 align:start position:0%
smaller form of extended producer
 
01:28:42.350 --> 01:28:42.360 align:start position:0%
responsibility um we know that there are
 
01:28:44.390 --> 01:28:44.400 align:start position:0%
other programs throughout this um the
 
01:28:46.709 --> 01:28:46.719 align:start position:0%
nation that um paint care has managed
 
01:28:49.910 --> 01:28:49.920 align:start position:0%
and works I have gone back and looked at
 
01:28:51.390 --> 01:28:51.400 align:start position:0%
previous iterations with the
 
01:28:54.270 --> 01:28:54.280 align:start position:0%
subcommittee of the um legislation
 
01:28:56.790 --> 01:28:56.800 align:start position:0%
thanks to Kristen grant our researcher
 
01:28:59.070 --> 01:28:59.080 align:start position:0%
um and there are some things that are
 
01:29:00.430 --> 01:29:00.440 align:start position:0%
lacking in the current piece of
 
01:29:03.430 --> 01:29:03.440 align:start position:0%
legislation that we do need to work on I
 
01:29:04.910 --> 01:29:04.920 align:start position:0%
understand that um there are
 
01:29:07.870 --> 01:29:07.880 align:start position:0%
conversations about you know what
 
01:29:11.149 --> 01:29:11.159 align:start position:0%
direction we need to go here if it's
 
01:29:12.870 --> 01:29:12.880 align:start position:0%
possible to get a working piece of
 
01:29:15.189 --> 01:29:15.199 align:start position:0%
legislation I'd like to give that um
 
01:29:18.109 --> 01:29:18.119 align:start position:0%
some you know more time here to get to a
 
01:29:21.629 --> 01:29:21.639 align:start position:0%
place where um we can get something that
 
01:29:23.790 --> 01:29:23.800 align:start position:0%
um maybe gets a little bit further than
 
01:29:26.189 --> 01:29:26.199 align:start position:0%
it did and in previous iterations it had
 
01:29:28.149 --> 01:29:28.159 align:start position:0%
made it all the way into the Senate so I
 
01:29:31.550 --> 01:29:31.560 align:start position:0%
would like to be able to work on that
 
01:29:33.950 --> 01:29:33.960 align:start position:0%
representative com thank you madam chair
 
01:29:35.669 --> 01:29:35.679 align:start position:0%
and thank you representative Marie for
 
01:29:38.070 --> 01:29:38.080 align:start position:0%
really working on this um do you think
 
01:29:40.189 --> 01:29:40.199 align:start position:0%
an interim study on this would be
 
01:29:42.189 --> 01:29:42.199 align:start position:0%
helpful so that we can really delve into
 
01:29:43.830 --> 01:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
this and come out with a really good
 
01:29:46.109 --> 01:29:46.119 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation in the
 
01:29:48.910 --> 01:29:48.920 align:start position:0%
fall thank you for the question um if I
 
01:29:51.709 --> 01:29:51.719 align:start position:0%
may Madam chair sure oh thank you um I
 
01:29:54.790 --> 01:29:54.800 align:start position:0%
do do think that that is um something
 
01:29:58.470 --> 01:29:58.480 align:start position:0%
that may be up for discussion but I do
 
01:30:01.709 --> 01:30:01.719 align:start position:0%
want to continue to look at perhaps
 
01:30:03.910 --> 01:30:03.920 align:start position:0%
maybe an initial model piece of
 
01:30:07.109 --> 01:30:07.119 align:start position:0%
legislation outside of what existed in
 
01:30:11.189 --> 01:30:11.199 align:start position:0%
this bill filing as a uh vehicle for
 
01:30:13.590 --> 01:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
kind of starting over again in a way
 
01:30:16.070 --> 01:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
that um the American codings Association
 
01:30:18.950 --> 01:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
and other entities at departments can
 
01:30:21.350 --> 01:30:21.360 align:start position:0%
support something that is right for New
 
01:30:24.669 --> 01:30:24.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so to say I'm open to that
 
01:30:27.270 --> 01:30:27.280 align:start position:0%
conversation I would like to have a few
 
01:30:29.350 --> 01:30:29.360 align:start position:0%
more days
 
01:30:33.510 --> 01:30:33.520 align:start position:0%
to ponder that concept if I may okay
 
01:30:38.030 --> 01:30:38.040 align:start position:0%
well the thing is um so our bills need
 
01:30:42.030 --> 01:30:42.040 align:start position:0%
to be out of committee I Believe by the
 
01:30:45.910 --> 01:30:45.920 align:start position:0%
21st and I was looking at executing this
 
01:30:50.310 --> 01:30:50.320 align:start position:0%
bill on March 13th next week do you
 
01:30:52.830 --> 01:30:52.840 align:start position:0%
think that any Amendment would be
 
01:30:56.910 --> 01:30:56.920 align:start position:0%
available by then or um our last
 
01:30:59.149 --> 01:30:59.159 align:start position:0%
otherwise our last exec session is going
 
01:31:00.950 --> 01:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
to be March
 
01:31:06.070 --> 01:31:06.080 align:start position:0%
19th so um if you don't feel that we
 
01:31:09.390 --> 01:31:09.400 align:start position:0%
could come up with a comprehensive
 
01:31:12.430 --> 01:31:12.440 align:start position:0%
Amendment then I think interim study
 
01:31:15.669 --> 01:31:15.679 align:start position:0%
would probably be the way to go with
 
01:31:19.430 --> 01:31:19.440 align:start position:0%
that um represent Bixby yeah I think
 
01:31:22.270 --> 01:31:22.280 align:start position:0%
that um it makes sense to
 
01:31:24.950 --> 01:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
uh see if we can get something together
 
01:31:29.229 --> 01:31:29.239 align:start position:0%
uh in the next uh week and a half and uh
 
01:31:33.950 --> 01:31:33.960 align:start position:0%
and you if at that if if when we get to
 
01:31:36.590 --> 01:31:36.600 align:start position:0%
the um that final exec session on the
 
01:31:39.990 --> 01:31:40.000 align:start position:0%
19th if it is in fact not ready to go
 
01:31:42.189 --> 01:31:42.199 align:start position:0%
then we can then we should consider the
 
01:31:44.590 --> 01:31:44.600 align:start position:0%
interim study but but I think that uh we
 
01:31:46.189 --> 01:31:46.199 align:start position:0%
may be able to pull something together
 
01:31:48.550 --> 01:31:48.560 align:start position:0%
within that time okay representative
 
01:31:48.560 --> 01:31:49.629 align:start position:0%
within that time okay representative
sofikitis

01:31:49.629 --> 01:31:49.639 align:start position:0%
sofikitis
 
01:31:52.950 --> 01:31:52.960 align:start position:0%
um just a housekeeping ISS could you uh
 
01:31:55.189 --> 01:31:55.199 align:start position:0%
Define architectural
 
01:31:55.199 --> 01:31:56.750 align:start position:0%
Define architectural
paint

01:31:56.750 --> 01:31:56.760 align:start position:0%
paint
 
01:32:00.189 --> 01:32:00.199 align:start position:0%
sure so to your point architectural
 
01:32:02.149 --> 01:32:02.159 align:start position:0%
paint is anything that could be used
 
01:32:04.830 --> 01:32:04.840 align:start position:0%
interior exterior and most specifically
 
01:32:06.790 --> 01:32:06.800 align:start position:0%
what we heard in committee around this
 
01:32:11.270 --> 01:32:11.280 align:start position:0%
bill was around um the potentially
 
01:32:14.109 --> 01:32:14.119 align:start position:0%
hazardous um paints not water soluble
 
01:32:16.790 --> 01:32:16.800 align:start position:0%
paints so
 
01:32:19.950 --> 01:32:19.960 align:start position:0%
yeah okay representative ger thank you
 
01:32:23.910 --> 01:32:23.920 align:start position:0%
madam chair Penza yes I I I I'm hopeful
 
01:32:25.390 --> 01:32:25.400 align:start position:0%
that we can actually to representative
 
01:32:26.830 --> 01:32:26.840 align:start position:0%
Murray's Point representative Big's
 
01:32:29.390 --> 01:32:29.400 align:start position:0%
Point actually come up with something
 
01:32:31.109 --> 01:32:31.119 align:start position:0%
within the time frame that we're looking
 
01:32:33.189 --> 01:32:33.199 align:start position:0%
at here because with paint cares for
 
01:32:35.510 --> 01:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
example these programs exist right in a
 
01:32:37.229 --> 01:32:37.239 align:start position:0%
lot of places we're not Reinventing the
 
01:32:39.390 --> 01:32:39.400 align:start position:0%
wheel and in fact to you know they have
 
01:32:41.510 --> 01:32:41.520 align:start position:0%
a specific program and you kind of have
 
01:32:43.870 --> 01:32:43.880 align:start position:0%
to as I understand it do it the way they
 
01:32:46.629 --> 01:32:46.639 align:start position:0%
do it uh for example uh and I think it's
 
01:32:48.750 --> 01:32:48.760 align:start position:0%
a good example of epr because it's an
 
01:32:48.760 --> 01:32:49.990 align:start position:0%
a good example of epr because it's an
industry

01:32:49.990 --> 01:32:50.000 align:start position:0%
industry
 
01:32:53.510 --> 01:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
driven example of epr right so I think
 
01:32:56.189 --> 01:32:56.199 align:start position:0%
there are there are lots of good
 
01:32:58.149 --> 01:32:58.159 align:start position:0%
examples of this in practice and so I
 
01:33:00.310 --> 01:33:00.320 align:start position:0%
think that we should on a relatively
 
01:33:03.709 --> 01:33:03.719 align:start position:0%
short timeline be able to uh map out
 
01:33:06.070 --> 01:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
something that could work as a test or
 
01:33:09.430 --> 01:33:09.440 align:start position:0%
pilot program um here thank you
 
01:33:09.440 --> 01:33:10.950 align:start position:0%
pilot program um here thank you
representative

01:33:10.950 --> 01:33:10.960 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:33:14.750 --> 01:33:14.760 align:start position:0%
Penza so I was there for the our little
 
01:33:17.310 --> 01:33:17.320 align:start position:0%
yeah so it was um it went really well do
 
01:33:20.390 --> 01:33:20.400 align:start position:0%
you have kind of um an idea in your head
 
01:33:23.229 --> 01:33:23.239 align:start position:0%
of how you would mod ify it so we could
 
01:33:24.750 --> 01:33:24.760 align:start position:0%
push this through now instead of going
 
01:33:27.390 --> 01:33:27.400 align:start position:0%
to interim study you know
 
01:33:29.510 --> 01:33:29.520 align:start position:0%
I there's a couple things that I have in
 
01:33:30.790 --> 01:33:30.800 align:start position:0%
my head and I just want to know if we're
 
01:33:32.950 --> 01:33:32.960 align:start position:0%
all kind of on the same page
 
01:33:34.550 --> 01:33:34.560 align:start position:0%
representative Murray yeah thank you for
 
01:33:36.109 --> 01:33:36.119 align:start position:0%
the question I do think that there are
 
01:33:38.390 --> 01:33:38.400 align:start position:0%
some specific concerns that the American
 
01:33:40.669 --> 01:33:40.679 align:start position:0%
codings Association had with sort of
 
01:33:43.229 --> 01:33:43.239 align:start position:0%
pieces of maybe previous iterations that
 
01:33:45.149 --> 01:33:45.159 align:start position:0%
didn't make it into the current
 
01:33:49.350 --> 01:33:49.360 align:start position:0%
iteration um as well as um you know I I
 
01:33:51.270 --> 01:33:51.280 align:start position:0%
do want to be very intentional I heard
 
01:33:53.750 --> 01:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
the members point about making sure that
 
01:33:56.790 --> 01:33:56.800 align:start position:0%
there were considerations given to all
 
01:34:00.750 --> 01:34:00.760 align:start position:0%
sorts of sizes of of paint providers um
 
01:34:02.629 --> 01:34:02.639 align:start position:0%
whether they were smaller or larger
 
01:34:04.910 --> 01:34:04.920 align:start position:0%
entities um so I do want to talk with
 
01:34:07.109 --> 01:34:07.119 align:start position:0%
the folks to make sure that we're we're
 
01:34:09.590 --> 01:34:09.600 align:start position:0%
being mindful to to that and if there is
 
01:34:12.870 --> 01:34:12.880 align:start position:0%
an exemption for some smaller areas or
 
01:34:15.550 --> 01:34:15.560 align:start position:0%
maybe um modifications that make sense
 
01:34:17.790 --> 01:34:17.800 align:start position:0%
under uh the codings Association
 
01:34:19.790 --> 01:34:19.800 align:start position:0%
framework that's where I would like to
 
01:34:23.910 --> 01:34:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:26.149 --> 01:34:26.159 align:start position:0%
representative H Haskins did you add
 
01:34:27.590 --> 01:34:27.600 align:start position:0%
your hand up before yes thank you madam
 
01:34:30.310 --> 01:34:30.320 align:start position:0%
chair I was thinking about the testimony
 
01:34:32.870 --> 01:34:32.880 align:start position:0%
of Sarah silk who's here today from
 
01:34:36.030 --> 01:34:36.040 align:start position:0%
wolfboro and I was really impressed with
 
01:34:38.870 --> 01:34:38.880 align:start position:0%
the idea that um
 
01:34:42.270 --> 01:34:42.280 align:start position:0%
these these programs do exist as has
 
01:34:44.390 --> 01:34:44.400 align:start position:0%
been said and I second everything
 
01:34:47.070 --> 01:34:47.080 align:start position:0%
representative Murray said and actually
 
01:34:49.750 --> 01:34:49.760 align:start position:0%
even some grants that are available so I
 
01:34:52.270 --> 01:34:52.280 align:start position:0%
don't know how that could work in into
 
01:34:53.990 --> 01:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
what we'd like to come up with but I
 
01:34:56.870 --> 01:34:56.880 align:start position:0%
think it's it's exciting to believe that
 
01:34:58.870 --> 01:34:58.880 align:start position:0%
we could really do better because it
 
01:35:01.830 --> 01:35:01.840 align:start position:0%
does indeed impact our landfills with
 
01:35:04.709 --> 01:35:04.719 align:start position:0%
all this sand and kitty litter
 
01:35:06.629 --> 01:35:06.639 align:start position:0%
representative maray additionally I had
 
01:35:08.109 --> 01:35:08.119 align:start position:0%
an interesting thought about this when
 
01:35:10.109 --> 01:35:10.119 align:start position:0%
we're talking about um affordable
 
01:35:13.470 --> 01:35:13.480 align:start position:0%
housing and the way to sort of have a a
 
01:35:17.030 --> 01:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
conversation around other ways to um
 
01:35:19.830 --> 01:35:19.840 align:start position:0%
have products and and um things
 
01:35:21.910 --> 01:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
available that are more affordable
 
01:35:23.669 --> 01:35:23.679 align:start position:0%
what we heard in testimony through paint
 
01:35:25.709 --> 01:35:25.719 align:start position:0%
care is that some of these products are
 
01:35:28.830 --> 01:35:28.840 align:start position:0%
sold at a lower cost and are available
 
01:35:30.910 --> 01:35:30.920 align:start position:0%
to individuals um and it keeps them out
 
01:35:33.229 --> 01:35:33.239 align:start position:0%
of the landfill and it keeps sort of a
 
01:35:36.149 --> 01:35:36.159 align:start position:0%
broad spectrum of products available to
 
01:35:38.629 --> 01:35:38.639 align:start position:0%
a lot of individuals and I think that it
 
01:35:40.910 --> 01:35:40.920 align:start position:0%
has the potential for being a win-win
 
01:35:43.270 --> 01:35:43.280 align:start position:0%
for lots of
 
01:35:46.750 --> 01:35:46.760 align:start position:0%
folks any other discussion on this
 
01:35:50.510 --> 01:35:50.520 align:start position:0%
bill so okay so I guess um work will
 
01:35:52.310 --> 01:35:52.320 align:start position:0%
continue on
 
01:35:56.790 --> 01:35:56.800 align:start position:0%
hp504 and um I guess I will put uh
 
01:36:01.030 --> 01:36:01.040 align:start position:0%
schedule it for uh exec on Tuesday March
 
01:36:04.229 --> 01:36:04.239 align:start position:0%
19th which would be our last exec
 
01:36:07.750 --> 01:36:07.760 align:start position:0%
session day um and if it's got an
 
01:36:11.270 --> 01:36:11.280 align:start position:0%
amendment that's ready um then we could
 
01:36:14.510 --> 01:36:14.520 align:start position:0%
pass that out um and if not then we
 
01:36:16.550 --> 01:36:16.560 align:start position:0%
could inter room study it I
 
01:36:20.590 --> 01:36:20.600 align:start position:0%
suppose and um but I I think I would
 
01:36:22.790 --> 01:36:22.800 align:start position:0%
like to
 
01:36:22.800 --> 01:36:24.750 align:start position:0%
like to
um

01:36:24.750 --> 01:36:24.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:28.590 --> 01:36:28.600 align:start position:0%
include a further discussion uh about
 
01:36:31.390 --> 01:36:31.400 align:start position:0%
that next week when we do our work
 
01:36:34.470 --> 01:36:34.480 align:start position:0%
session um on Wednesday March 13th
 
01:36:36.430 --> 01:36:36.440 align:start position:0%
because you can give us an update on on
 
01:36:38.070 --> 01:36:38.080 align:start position:0%
where you are with the amendment on that
 
01:36:40.229 --> 01:36:40.239 align:start position:0%
okay alrighty
 
01:36:43.510 --> 01:36:43.520 align:start position:0%
good uh that pretty much concludes um if
 
01:36:45.430 --> 01:36:45.440 align:start position:0%
unless anybody else has any other
 
01:36:47.310 --> 01:36:47.320 align:start position:0%
comments or questions on
 
01:36:49.950 --> 01:36:49.960 align:start position:0%
anything um that pretty much concludes
 
01:36:52.109 --> 01:36:52.119 align:start position:0%
the bills that we wanted to disc discuss
 
01:36:54.790 --> 01:36:54.800 align:start position:0%
today and
 
01:36:58.229 --> 01:36:58.239 align:start position:0%
um we will have another work session
 
01:37:01.870 --> 01:37:01.880 align:start position:0%
tomorrow morning to discuss uh the bill
 
01:37:04.470 --> 01:37:04.480 align:start position:0%
we're going to hear this afternoon as
 
01:37:06.830 --> 01:37:06.840 align:start position:0%
well as the two other landfill bills
 
01:37:10.669 --> 01:37:10.679 align:start position:0%
that we had uh heard uh and didn't
 
01:37:12.390 --> 01:37:12.400 align:start position:0%
really have much time to discuss in the
 
01:37:15.390 --> 01:37:15.400 align:start position:0%
previous work session so um that that's
 
01:37:17.149 --> 01:37:17.159 align:start position:0%
going to happen tomorrow
 
01:37:20.790 --> 01:37:20.800 align:start position:0%
morning and um I guess we're done with
 
01:37:24.470 --> 01:37:24.480 align:start position:0%
our work session and we have time to

03:05:10.670 --> 03:05:10.680 align:start position:0%
number of pink slips or pink cards if

you intend to speak I would appreciate
 
03:05:15.990 --> 03:05:16.000 align:start position:0%

as soon as possible so we have a whole
 
03:05:23.469 --> 03:05:23.479 align:start position:0%
have them all um a couple of rules for
 
03:05:27.309 --> 03:05:27.319 align:start position:0%
us um after the sponsor of the bill
 
03:05:29.830 --> 03:05:29.840 align:start position:0%
introduces the bill uh we will be
 
03:05:31.790 --> 03:05:31.800 align:start position:0%
inviting individ we will be calling
 
03:05:34.070 --> 03:05:34.080 align:start position:0%

cards and I'm I'm going to be setting
 
03:05:38.750 --> 03:05:38.760 align:start position:0%
because we have so many people here and
 
03:05:40.870 --> 03:05:40.880 align:start position:0%
so many pink cards I am going to be
 
03:05:44.190 --> 03:05:44.200 align:start position:0%
setting testimony at three minutes
 
03:05:47.150 --> 03:05:47.160 align:start position:0%
uh at that point the committee will um
 
03:05:49.469 --> 03:05:49.479 align:start position:0%
take the opportunity to ask you
 
03:05:52.429 --> 03:05:52.439 align:start position:0%
questions they may or may not ask you
 
03:05:55.830 --> 03:05:55.840 align:start position:0%
questions um my vice chair is going to
 
03:06:00.389 --> 03:06:00.399 align:start position:0%
be um letting you know what your time is
 
03:06:02.349 --> 03:06:02.359 align:start position:0%
by uh when you get to the two-minute

Mark he'll show a yellow when you get to
 
03:06:08.070 --> 03:06:08.080 align:start position:0%
the three minute uh we're close to the
 
03:06:11.269 --> 03:06:11.279 align:start position:0%
three minute he'll Flash the pink uh the
 
03:06:15.030 --> 03:06:15.040 align:start position:0%
orange one so that you are aware of the

orange one so that you are aware of the
time

03:06:17.389 --> 03:06:17.399 align:start position:0%
time
 
03:06:21.910 --> 03:06:21.920 align:start position:0%
um and that's pretty much uh how we will
 
03:06:23.590 --> 03:06:23.600 align:start position:0%
um proceed
 
03:06:28.670 --> 03:06:28.680 align:start position:0%
today and I also want to make it
 
03:06:31.389 --> 03:06:31.399 align:start position:0%
clear that we are all to be respectful
 
03:06:34.110 --> 03:06:34.120 align:start position:0%
of everybody's um positions and what
 
03:06:37.830 --> 03:06:37.840 align:start position:0%
they have to say I would uh expect that
 
03:06:40.269 --> 03:06:40.279 align:start position:0%
nobody would uh make any disparaging
 
03:06:42.950 --> 03:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
remarks against any particular people or
 
03:06:42.960 --> 03:06:43.910 align:start position:0%
remarks against any particular people or
or

03:06:43.910 --> 03:06:43.920 align:start position:0%
or
 
03:06:46.910 --> 03:06:46.920 align:start position:0%
organizations and um let's just hear
 
03:06:49.229 --> 03:06:49.239 align:start position:0%
what you have to say your experiences
 
03:06:51.429 --> 03:06:51.439 align:start position:0%
we're interested in hearing your
 
03:06:55.670 --> 03:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
expertise or um just your opinion on
 
03:06:58.229 --> 03:06:58.239 align:start position:0%
this particular piece of legislation
 
03:07:02.550 --> 03:07:02.560 align:start position:0%
just this bill um and um and that with
 
03:07:05.550 --> 03:07:05.560 align:start position:0%
that I am going to open up the
 
03:07:08.590 --> 03:07:08.600 align:start position:0%
hearing for HB
 
03:07:12.630 --> 03:07:12.640 align:start position:0%
1102 which is relative to the de to the
 
03:07:14.349 --> 03:07:14.359 align:start position:0%
definition of animal
 
03:07:16.469 --> 03:07:16.479 align:start position:0%
cruelty and I
 
03:07:20.830 --> 03:07:20.840 align:start position:0%
am U happy to hear our sponsor uh
 
03:07:23.349 --> 03:07:23.359 align:start position:0%
representative Reed uh introduce this
 
03:07:25.349 --> 03:07:25.359 align:start position:0%
bill to the committee so good afternoon
 
03:07:28.229 --> 03:07:28.239 align:start position:0%
and thank you thank you madam chair and
 
03:07:31.469 --> 03:07:31.479 align:start position:0%

03:07:34.269 --> 03:07:34.279 align:start position:0%
and uh thank you honorable members of
 
03:07:35.630 --> 03:07:35.640 align:start position:0%
the committee for the record my name is
 
03:07:38.510 --> 03:07:38.520 align:start position:0%
Ellen Reed I Rec I represent Rockingham
 
03:07:40.950 --> 03:07:40.960 align:start position:0%
10 which is New Market and new
 
03:07:45.229 --> 03:07:45.239 align:start position:0%
fields for me the Genesis of this bill
 
03:07:47.750 --> 03:07:47.760 align:start position:0%
goes back over 20 years ago when I
 
03:07:50.309 --> 03:07:50.319 align:start position:0%
watched a televised News segment
 
03:07:54.070 --> 03:07:54.080 align:start position:0%
covering a woman who had originally had
 
03:07:57.150 --> 03:07:57.160 align:start position:0%
a single cat that had a deformity of its
 
03:07:59.229 --> 03:07:59.239 align:start position:0%
front paws so it kind of sort of looked
 
03:08:01.309 --> 03:08:01.319 align:start position:0%
like a mangled kangaroo it had very
 
03:08:04.030 --> 03:08:04.040 align:start position:0%
short front paws that were twisted and
 
03:08:06.229 --> 03:08:06.239 align:start position:0%
she inbred that cat with its uh
 
03:08:09.030 --> 03:08:09.040 align:start position:0%
relatives until she had dozens of what
 
03:08:10.670 --> 03:08:10.680 align:start position:0%
she called twisty
 
03:08:14.389 --> 03:08:14.399 align:start position:0%
cats and wanted to registered this as a
 
03:08:17.550 --> 03:08:17.560 align:start position:0%
recognized breed and I thought good God
 
03:08:19.830 --> 03:08:19.840 align:start position:0%
and it would I think everyone who saw
 
03:08:21.590 --> 03:08:21.600 align:start position:0%
that piece the the understanding was
 
03:08:23.790 --> 03:08:23.800 align:start position:0%
this was ridiculous that this was
 
03:08:26.110 --> 03:08:26.120 align:start position:0%
inflicting cruelty in the name of
 
03:08:28.110 --> 03:08:28.120 align:start position:0%
wanting to start a new breed or or breed
 
03:08:31.469 --> 03:08:31.479 align:start position:0%
an animal and then sell the progyny um
 
03:08:34.950 --> 03:08:34.960 align:start position:0%
and I think it was universally seen as
 
03:08:38.590 --> 03:08:38.600 align:start position:0%
ridiculous um I like many people in the
 
03:08:41.990 --> 03:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
room on both sides of of this bill
 
03:08:44.590 --> 03:08:44.600 align:start position:0%
thought that recognized breeds I didn't
 
03:08:46.469 --> 03:08:46.479 align:start position:0%
really question the idea breeds are
 
03:08:48.790 --> 03:08:48.800 align:start position:0%
breeds um Registries are doing the right
 
03:08:50.469 --> 03:08:50.479 align:start position:0%
thing they obviously care about the
 
03:08:54.510 --> 03:08:54.520 align:start position:0%
animals uh flat noses are cute long
 
03:08:57.469 --> 03:08:57.479 align:start position:0%
backs are cute snoring and grunting is
 
03:09:00.510 --> 03:09:00.520 align:start position:0%
cute and this is fine and I thought this
 
03:09:03.510 --> 03:09:03.520 align:start position:0%
way for most of my
 
03:09:07.429 --> 03:09:07.439 align:start position:0%
life um when I found out that many of
 
03:09:09.269 --> 03:09:09.279 align:start position:0%
the breeds that we consider to be normal
 
03:09:12.990 --> 03:09:13.000 align:start position:0%
breeds actually suffer by definition you
 
03:09:15.710 --> 03:09:15.720 align:start position:0%
usually of how they have been bred
 
03:09:19.150 --> 03:09:19.160 align:start position:0%
suffer from a slew of awful awful
 
03:09:21.710 --> 03:09:21.720 align:start position:0%
medical conditions not just dogs and I
 
03:09:23.229 --> 03:09:23.239 align:start position:0%
want to be very clear that the bill
 
03:09:25.269 --> 03:09:25.279 align:start position:0%
covers all animals because it does
 
03:09:27.389 --> 03:09:27.399 align:start position:0%
happen in many different
 
03:09:30.830 --> 03:09:30.840 align:start position:0%
species um and it's not just brachy
 
03:09:34.030 --> 03:09:34.040 align:start position:0%
which we'll get into but they suffer
 
03:09:36.630 --> 03:09:36.640 align:start position:0%
from deformities that were intentionally
 
03:09:40.110 --> 03:09:40.120 align:start position:0%
bred for their extreme appearance
 
03:09:40.120 --> 03:09:41.630 align:start position:0%
bred for their extreme appearance
extreme

03:09:41.630 --> 03:09:41.640 align:start position:0%
extreme
 
03:09:44.190 --> 03:09:44.200 align:start position:0%
Aesthetics when when I found this out I
 
03:09:47.110 --> 03:09:47.120 align:start position:0%
connected it back to that weird news
 
03:09:49.269 --> 03:09:49.279 align:start position:0%
story that I had seen with the twisty
 
03:09:53.190 --> 03:09:53.200 align:start position:0%
cats and I thought why are we doing this
 
03:09:55.510 --> 03:09:55.520 align:start position:0%
is it is it the case that yes this one
 
03:09:57.429 --> 03:09:57.439 align:start position:0%
woman tried to do the twisty cat thing
 
03:09:59.910 --> 03:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
but in fact this has been this kind of
 
03:10:04.510 --> 03:10:04.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:08.030 --> 03:10:08.040 align:start position:0%
while so it turns out my experience was
 
03:10:10.830 --> 03:10:10.840 align:start position:0%
not unique in fact many many people who
 
03:10:14.510 --> 03:10:14.520 align:start position:0%
own especially calic dogs these are
 
03:10:18.309 --> 03:10:18.319 align:start position:0%
flat-faced dogs and cats um felt like I
 
03:10:20.349 --> 03:10:20.359 align:start position:0%
did felt like these breeds were normal
 
03:10:22.550 --> 03:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
things that their behaviors and their uh
 
03:10:24.429 --> 03:10:24.439 align:start position:0%
appearance were normal and healthy for
 
03:10:27.550 --> 03:10:27.560 align:start position:0%
the breed um and then they bought a
 
03:10:31.070 --> 03:10:31.080 align:start position:0%
puppy usually a registered puppy um and
 
03:10:32.910 --> 03:10:32.920 align:start position:0%
then they experienced what it's really
 
03:10:37.070 --> 03:10:37.080 align:start position:0%
like for most people who have an animal
 
03:10:40.229 --> 03:10:40.239 align:start position:0%
like this you have received probably I
 
03:10:41.950 --> 03:10:41.960 align:start position:0%
I'm wagering I obviously don't have
 
03:10:43.550 --> 03:10:43.560 align:start position:0%
access to all the testimony you've
 
03:10:45.710 --> 03:10:45.720 align:start position:0%
received directly um probably hundreds
 
03:10:47.750 --> 03:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
of emails from people who own these
 
03:10:49.910 --> 03:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
animals and thought that this was a cute
 
03:10:52.190 --> 03:10:52.200 align:start position:0%
breed whatever breed they got and
 
03:10:53.990 --> 03:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
thought it was great and bought you know
 
03:10:56.469 --> 03:10:56.479 align:start position:0%
usually at a great price bought a puppy
 
03:10:59.510 --> 03:10:59.520 align:start position:0%
perhaps a kitten sometimes a horse and
 
03:11:02.710 --> 03:11:02.720 align:start position:0%
then went wow I can't believe these
 
03:11:05.269 --> 03:11:05.279 align:start position:0%
deformities were intentionally
 
03:11:08.469 --> 03:11:08.479 align:start position:0%
bred so since then I've learned that
 
03:11:11.750 --> 03:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
especially in American breeding
 
03:11:14.710 --> 03:11:14.720 align:start position:0%
practices uh and breed Registries in
 
03:11:17.830 --> 03:11:17.840 align:start position:0%
America um we have over many many
 
03:11:21.550 --> 03:11:21.560 align:start position:0%
decades pursued this unending pursuit of
 
03:11:24.429 --> 03:11:24.439 align:start position:0%
extreme Aesthetics extreme Aesthetics so
 
03:11:26.750 --> 03:11:26.760 align:start position:0%
if a short nose is short nose is
 
03:11:29.110 --> 03:11:29.120 align:start position:0%
desirable in a breed and even shorter
 
03:11:31.510 --> 03:11:31.520 align:start position:0%
nose is even better or if a long back is
 
03:11:33.910 --> 03:11:33.920 align:start position:0%
desirable an even longer back is better
 
03:11:36.389 --> 03:11:36.399 align:start position:0%
and the thing about the extreme and I
 
03:11:38.429 --> 03:11:38.439 align:start position:0%
don't want to like pretend that I'm
 
03:11:40.389 --> 03:11:40.399 align:start position:0%
saying something that that it's it's not
 
03:11:42.630 --> 03:11:42.640 align:start position:0%
accurate the word extreme comes up in
 
03:11:45.550 --> 03:11:45.560 align:start position:0%
the the breed registry uh confirmation
 
03:11:48.950 --> 03:11:48.960 align:start position:0%
standards repeatedly extremely short
 
03:11:53.150 --> 03:11:53.160 align:start position:0%
nose extremely this extremely that and
 
03:11:55.469 --> 03:11:55.479 align:start position:0%
this creates a chasing after an Ever
 
03:11:59.790 --> 03:11:59.800 align:start position:0%
bigger um more extreme confirmation and
 
03:12:02.190 --> 03:12:02.200 align:start position:0%
over the decades the effect is
 
03:12:04.590 --> 03:12:04.600 align:start position:0%
eventually we get to a point where that
 
03:12:07.830 --> 03:12:07.840 align:start position:0%
extreme confirmation is not compatible
 
03:12:10.670 --> 03:12:10.680 align:start position:0%
with healthy life you cannot just keep
 
03:12:12.670 --> 03:12:12.680 align:start position:0%
going more and more extreme with certain
 
03:12:14.910 --> 03:12:14.920 align:start position:0%
features of the body and have that
 
03:12:17.510 --> 03:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
individual be able for example to
 
03:12:20.710 --> 03:12:20.720 align:start position:0%
breathe or be able to walk or reproduce
 
03:12:22.550 --> 03:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
or many many other different things
 
03:12:23.750 --> 03:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
which I'll get
 
03:12:26.510 --> 03:12:26.520 align:start position:0%
into and unfortunately many Registries
 
03:12:29.510 --> 03:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
encourage this um like I said they use
 
03:12:30.710 --> 03:12:30.720 align:start position:0%
the word extreme in their own
 
03:12:32.590 --> 03:12:32.600 align:start position:0%
confirmation standard so it creates this
 
03:12:36.150 --> 03:12:36.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:38.630 --> 03:12:38.640 align:start position:0%
will I want to be clear that the bill
 
03:12:41.670 --> 03:12:41.680 align:start position:0%
itself is not breed specific and it does
 
03:12:44.710 --> 03:12:44.720 align:start position:0%
not ban the owning or adopting of any
 
03:12:47.950 --> 03:12:47.960 align:start position:0%
animal any animal whatsoever what it
 
03:12:51.830 --> 03:12:51.840 align:start position:0%
says is that you cannot sell for profit
 
03:12:54.469 --> 03:12:54.479 align:start position:0%
nor intentionally breed intentionally
 
03:12:56.110 --> 03:12:56.120 align:start position:0%
which of course is a criminal um
 
03:12:59.710 --> 03:12:59.720 align:start position:0%
liability word any two individuals with
 
03:13:02.269 --> 03:13:02.279 align:start position:0%
the same deformity that cause that
 
03:13:04.910 --> 03:13:04.920 align:start position:0%
causes suffering so that's that's
 
03:13:04.920 --> 03:13:06.190 align:start position:0%
causes suffering so that's that's
literally

03:13:06.190 --> 03:13:06.200 align:start position:0%
literally
 
03:13:11.630 --> 03:13:11.640 align:start position:0%
it now I want to get into uh well let me
 
03:13:13.790 --> 03:13:13.800 align:start position:0%
just stay on that for a second the the
 
03:13:15.950 --> 03:13:15.960 align:start position:0%
the idea that this is going to mean like
 
03:13:18.750 --> 03:13:18.760 align:start position:0%
I'm going after specific breeds that
 
03:13:20.229 --> 03:13:20.239 align:start position:0%
people won't be able to breed those
 
03:13:23.429 --> 03:13:23.439 align:start position:0%
breeds anymore that is not true people
 
03:13:25.110 --> 03:13:25.120 align:start position:0%
can still breed they just have to breed
 
03:13:26.710 --> 03:13:26.720 align:start position:0%
two individuals that don't have the
 
03:13:29.389 --> 03:13:29.399 align:start position:0%
identical deformity that causes
 
03:13:31.990 --> 03:13:32.000 align:start position:0%
suffering the problem is because once
 
03:13:33.870 --> 03:13:33.880 align:start position:0%
again that chasing after the ever more
 
03:13:37.229 --> 03:13:37.239 align:start position:0%
extreme confirmation in some breeds the
 
03:13:39.469 --> 03:13:39.479 align:start position:0%
ones that are registered as pure bread
 
03:13:41.870 --> 03:13:41.880 align:start position:0%
have too limited a genetic pool so what
 
03:13:43.990 --> 03:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
it means is that in order to continue
 
03:13:46.550 --> 03:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
breeding those breeds breeders may have
 
03:13:50.190 --> 03:13:50.200 align:start position:0%
to introduce um individuals that have
 
03:13:52.710 --> 03:13:52.720 align:start position:0%
healthier confirmation standards that
 
03:13:55.150 --> 03:13:55.160 align:start position:0%
may not be papered as purebred according
 
03:13:57.910 --> 03:13:57.920 align:start position:0%
to the registry of their choice but
 
03:13:59.710 --> 03:13:59.720 align:start position:0%
there are many many pushes around the
 
03:14:01.710 --> 03:14:01.720 align:start position:0%
world and in this country to do just
 
03:14:05.950 --> 03:14:05.960 align:start position:0%
that um in the handout that I passed out
 
03:14:09.110 --> 03:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
there is a page that gives an example of
 
03:14:13.030 --> 03:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
the difference between an American conf
 
03:14:14.990 --> 03:14:15.000 align:start position:0%
a typical American confirmation standard
 
03:14:18.389 --> 03:14:18.399 align:start position:0%
and and one of these individuals that is
 
03:14:24.030 --> 03:14:24.040 align:start position:0%
bred it is the second no third to last
 
03:14:28.990 --> 03:14:29.000 align:start position:0%
page the individual on the right is a uh
 
03:14:31.790 --> 03:14:31.800 align:start position:0%
Blue Ribbon award-winning show
 
03:14:35.150 --> 03:14:35.160 align:start position:0%
dog you can see that that nose is
 
03:14:39.110 --> 03:14:39.120 align:start position:0%
completely flat like a wall with his
 
03:14:42.070 --> 03:14:42.080 align:start position:0%
forehead the that's on the left the
 
03:14:46.030 --> 03:14:46.040 align:start position:0%
individ on the right is from hobu French
 
03:14:49.070 --> 03:14:49.080 align:start position:0%
bulldogs and he has a snout and here's
 
03:14:49.080 --> 03:14:50.030 align:start position:0%
bulldogs and he has a snout and here's
the

03:14:50.030 --> 03:14:50.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:14:53.309 --> 03:14:53.319 align:start position:0%
thing pushing to go back to healthier
 
03:14:55.269 --> 03:14:55.279 align:start position:0%
breed standards is not a new thing
 
03:14:57.469 --> 03:14:57.479 align:start position:0%
because almost every single one of these
 
03:15:00.309 --> 03:15:00.319 align:start position:0%
breeds originally had a much much
 
03:15:02.910 --> 03:15:02.920 align:start position:0%
healthier breed confirmation standard
 
03:15:05.429 --> 03:15:05.439 align:start position:0%
you can see this in photographs as young
 
03:15:09.550 --> 03:15:09.560 align:start position:0%
as 50 years ago these dogs had noses you
 
03:15:11.590 --> 03:15:11.600 align:start position:0%
can see this in paintings even going
 
03:15:14.309 --> 03:15:14.319 align:start position:0%
back hundreds of years years where for
 
03:15:16.870 --> 03:15:16.880 align:start position:0%
example Bulldogs had noses they had to
 
03:15:18.870 --> 03:15:18.880 align:start position:0%
they were bred for athletic originally
 
03:15:23.150 --> 03:15:23.160 align:start position:0%
bred for athletic activity so the idea
 
03:15:25.030 --> 03:15:25.040 align:start position:0%
that we have gotten so far away from
 
03:15:26.550 --> 03:15:26.560 align:start position:0%
those healthy breed standards to the
 
03:15:27.910 --> 03:15:27.920 align:start position:0%
point that we are intentionally
 
03:15:31.349 --> 03:15:31.359 align:start position:0%
inflicting suffering because it's cute
 
03:15:33.750 --> 03:15:33.760 align:start position:0%
is what we're trying to go out after not
 
03:15:36.070 --> 03:15:36.080 align:start position:0%
the idea of breeding not any particular
 
03:15:38.269 --> 03:15:38.279 align:start position:0%
breed yes you can still breed all these
 
03:15:40.469 --> 03:15:40.479 align:start position:0%
breeds you just have to do it in a way
 
03:15:43.269 --> 03:15:43.279 align:start position:0%
that you you are not intentionally
 
03:15:43.279 --> 03:15:48.830 align:start position:0%
that you you are not intentionally
creating

03:15:48.830 --> 03:15:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:53.110 --> 03:15:53.120 align:start position:0%
suffering so I list as one example and
 
03:15:55.110 --> 03:15:55.120 align:start position:0%
it's just a for example it's including
 
03:15:57.510 --> 03:15:57.520 align:start position:0%
but not limited to
 
03:16:01.670 --> 03:16:01.680 align:start position:0%
brachy which is the term for a short
 
03:16:05.189 --> 03:16:05.199 align:start position:0%
nose um this is what is common amongst
 
03:16:07.790 --> 03:16:07.800 align:start position:0%
like French Bulldogs Boston Terriers
 
03:16:10.870 --> 03:16:10.880 align:start position:0%
pugs um also Persian cats things like
 
03:16:13.590 --> 03:16:13.600 align:start position:0%
that the thing is is that I think we
 
03:16:14.790 --> 03:16:14.800 align:start position:0%
look at them like oh they just have a
 
03:16:16.870 --> 03:16:16.880 align:start position:0%
short nose big
 
03:16:19.229 --> 03:16:19.239 align:start position:0%
deal when they have short when they have
 
03:16:21.429 --> 03:16:21.439 align:start position:0%
bred to shorten the
 
03:16:24.309 --> 03:16:24.319 align:start position:0%
nose the bone and especially the soft
 
03:16:26.269 --> 03:16:26.279 align:start position:0%
tissue the soft pallet didn't go
 
03:16:28.590 --> 03:16:28.600 align:start position:0%
anywhere so what that means and you can
 
03:16:30.389 --> 03:16:30.399 align:start position:0%
see there's multiple x-rays throughout
 
03:16:32.830 --> 03:16:32.840 align:start position:0%
this handout what that means and and
 
03:16:35.469 --> 03:16:35.479 align:start position:0%
pictures of skulls what that means is
 
03:16:37.790 --> 03:16:37.800 align:start position:0%
all of that tissue all of that matter
 
03:16:40.110 --> 03:16:40.120 align:start position:0%
that would have gone into a full muzzle
 
03:16:44.269 --> 03:16:44.279 align:start position:0%
has been shoved into to basically
 
03:16:48.389 --> 03:16:48.399 align:start position:0%
flatness and usually this causes what is
 
03:16:50.910 --> 03:16:50.920 align:start position:0%
called um
 
03:16:55.309 --> 03:16:55.319 align:start position:0%
braic obstructive Airway syndrome
 
03:16:58.349 --> 03:16:58.359 align:start position:0%
boas the majority of these flat-nosed
 
03:17:02.269 --> 03:17:02.279 align:start position:0%
breeds suffer from some level of boas
 
03:17:04.150 --> 03:17:04.160 align:start position:0%
and there's a chart in here that goes
 
03:17:07.189 --> 03:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
over three different breeds French
 
03:17:11.189 --> 03:17:11.199 align:start position:0%
Bulldogs in particular 90% of all French
 
03:17:15.670 --> 03:17:15.680 align:start position:0%
bulldogs have some level of boas now
 
03:17:18.269 --> 03:17:18.279 align:start position:0%
here's the thing about boas I know that
 
03:17:20.550 --> 03:17:20.560 align:start position:0%
the owners of these breeds think that
 
03:17:23.830 --> 03:17:23.840 align:start position:0%
the snoring the grunting this the the
 
03:17:25.870 --> 03:17:25.880 align:start position:0%
constant sounds coming from the
 
03:17:27.550 --> 03:17:27.560 align:start position:0%
breathing of their animal is cute and
 
03:17:29.830 --> 03:17:29.840 align:start position:0%
normal they will call it normal for the
 
03:17:31.269 --> 03:17:31.279 align:start position:0%
breed and I guess it is normal because
 
03:17:32.990 --> 03:17:33.000 align:start position:0%
it is standard in the breed and that's
 
03:17:36.830 --> 03:17:36.840 align:start position:0%
kind of the problem but everyone knows
 
03:17:39.150 --> 03:17:39.160 align:start position:0%
that if you have a clear pipe and you
 
03:17:41.189 --> 03:17:41.199 align:start position:0%
push air through it it doesn't make a
 
03:17:42.830 --> 03:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
gurgling sound
 
03:17:44.910 --> 03:17:44.920 align:start position:0%
it only makes a gurgling sound if
 
03:17:47.070 --> 03:17:47.080 align:start position:0%
there's something obstructing it if you
 
03:17:49.030 --> 03:17:49.040 align:start position:0%
go to your doctor and you're constantly
 
03:17:51.750 --> 03:17:51.760 align:start position:0%
sound your lungs are constantly sounding
 
03:17:54.870 --> 03:17:54.880 align:start position:0%
snorting grunting gurgling your doctor's
 
03:17:56.070 --> 03:17:56.080 align:start position:0%
going to say there's something wrong and
 
03:17:57.910 --> 03:17:57.920 align:start position:0%
we know this because we all know of a
 
03:17:59.950 --> 03:17:59.960 align:start position:0%
condition called Sleep Apnea if you
 
03:18:01.950 --> 03:18:01.960 align:start position:0%
snore a lot there's something going on
 
03:18:03.870 --> 03:18:03.880 align:start position:0%
and you're not getting oxygen and in
 
03:18:06.510 --> 03:18:06.520 align:start position:0%
fact very many of these breeds the
 
03:18:09.269 --> 03:18:09.279 align:start position:0%
individuals will adopt unorthodox
 
03:18:11.229 --> 03:18:11.239 align:start position:0%
sleeping positions they will usually
 
03:18:12.750 --> 03:18:12.760 align:start position:0%
sleep sitting up there's several
 
03:18:14.510 --> 03:18:14.520 align:start position:0%
pictures of this phenomenon they will
 
03:18:16.150 --> 03:18:16.160 align:start position:0%
sleep sitting up and with something
 
03:18:19.590 --> 03:18:19.600 align:start position:0%
lodged in their mouth to help them get
 
03:18:22.469 --> 03:18:22.479 align:start position:0%
more air as they
 
03:18:24.950 --> 03:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
sleep and the thing is is that the the
 
03:18:26.550 --> 03:18:26.560 align:start position:0%
owners of these breeds often consider
 
03:18:28.630 --> 03:18:28.640 align:start position:0%
this to be AC cute Behavior because it
 
03:18:30.309 --> 03:18:30.319 align:start position:0%
it I guess it kind of looks cute but
 
03:18:31.790 --> 03:18:31.800 align:start position:0%
when you realize that they're doing it
 
03:18:34.229 --> 03:18:34.239 align:start position:0%
because they literally can't breathe
 
03:18:36.150 --> 03:18:36.160 align:start position:0%
that they stop breathing when they sleep
 
03:18:38.309 --> 03:18:38.319 align:start position:0%
any other way then you realize that you
 
03:18:40.349 --> 03:18:40.359 align:start position:0%
are actually in have inflicted suffering
 
03:18:44.950 --> 03:18:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:46.870 --> 03:18:46.880 align:start position:0%
so the fact that there is a grunting
 
03:18:49.389 --> 03:18:49.399 align:start position:0%
snorting sound just from breathing just
 
03:18:52.870 --> 03:18:52.880 align:start position:0%
from breathing is simple
 
03:18:56.229 --> 03:18:56.239 align:start position:0%
physics in humans by the way and and
 
03:18:58.910 --> 03:18:58.920 align:start position:0%
what that also means is that very many
 
03:19:01.229 --> 03:19:01.239 align:start position:0%
times they cannot run we'll get into
 
03:19:03.790 --> 03:19:03.800 align:start position:0%
grading and and and how they determine
 
03:19:07.349 --> 03:19:07.359 align:start position:0%
that um and they also can't cool
 
03:19:10.030 --> 03:19:10.040 align:start position:0%
themselves because panting is required
 
03:19:14.150 --> 03:19:14.160 align:start position:0%
to cool um in dogs and if they can't
 
03:19:16.870 --> 03:19:16.880 align:start position:0%
breathe properly and they don't have um
 
03:19:18.389 --> 03:19:18.399 align:start position:0%
access and I have a veterinarian who can
 
03:19:20.950 --> 03:19:20.960 align:start position:0%
go into more detail I'm sure access to
 
03:19:23.309 --> 03:19:23.319 align:start position:0%
the the parts of the the structures that
 
03:19:25.910 --> 03:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
actually help with the cooling then they
 
03:19:27.510 --> 03:19:27.520 align:start position:0%
can't properly cool themselves so very
 
03:19:29.349 --> 03:19:29.359 align:start position:0%
many of these breeds can't be exposed to
 
03:19:32.269 --> 03:19:32.279 align:start position:0%
even moderately warm weather again it's
 
03:19:34.510 --> 03:19:34.520 align:start position:0%
individual to individual you may have
 
03:19:37.550 --> 03:19:37.560 align:start position:0%
very many people go not my dog not my
 
03:19:39.750 --> 03:19:39.760 align:start position:0%
dog that's great then this wouldn't
 
03:19:42.429 --> 03:19:42.439 align:start position:0%
impact them if they are truly breeding
 
03:19:45.269 --> 03:19:45.279 align:start position:0%
healthy healthy animals this bill will
 
03:19:47.550 --> 03:19:47.560 align:start position:0%
not impact
 
03:19:50.469 --> 03:19:50.479 align:start position:0%
them but it's not just I I considered
 
03:19:53.070 --> 03:19:53.080 align:start position:0%
listing boas specifically because I'm an
 
03:19:55.030 --> 03:19:55.040 align:start position:0%
asthma sufferer and I have a lot of
 
03:19:56.950 --> 03:19:56.960 align:start position:0%
sympathy for people who can't breathe or
 
03:19:59.510 --> 03:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
animals who can't breathe um as the
 
03:20:02.110 --> 03:20:02.120 align:start position:0%
example saying boas is the example but
 
03:20:04.630 --> 03:20:04.640 align:start position:0%
really brail doesn't stop at boas
 
03:20:08.269 --> 03:20:08.279 align:start position:0%
there's a whole slw of problems that
 
03:20:11.990 --> 03:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
come with braisy in humans it is called
 
03:20:15.670 --> 03:20:15.680 align:start position:0%
robinow syndrome and um I was advised to
 
03:20:17.910 --> 03:20:17.920 align:start position:0%
not give you pictures of individuals
 
03:20:19.630 --> 03:20:19.640 align:start position:0%
human individuals that have robinow
 
03:20:20.830 --> 03:20:20.840 align:start position:0%
syndrome because it might be too
 
03:20:23.790 --> 03:20:23.800 align:start position:0%
upsetting but um if you want to look up
 
03:20:25.750 --> 03:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
pictures and see the medical conditions
 
03:20:27.830 --> 03:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
that are associated with that condition
 
03:20:30.550 --> 03:20:30.560 align:start position:0%
feel free and just imagine would we ever
 
03:20:33.429 --> 03:20:33.439 align:start position:0%
say it's okay for two human beings to
 
03:20:35.950 --> 03:20:35.960 align:start position:0%
intentionally intentionally trying to
 
03:20:39.550 --> 03:20:39.560 align:start position:0%
create that condition it would be absurd
 
03:20:41.110 --> 03:20:41.120 align:start position:0%
and that is what we accept without
 
03:20:42.750 --> 03:20:42.760 align:start position:0%
question in
 
03:20:45.150 --> 03:20:45.160 align:start position:0%
animals other conditions that go along
 
03:20:45.160 --> 03:20:46.110 align:start position:0%
animals other conditions that go along
with

03:20:46.110 --> 03:20:46.120 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:20:49.229 --> 03:20:49.239 align:start position:0%
braisy very often their their craniums
 
03:20:51.070 --> 03:20:51.080 align:start position:0%
cannot contain their brain matter so
 
03:20:53.229 --> 03:20:53.239 align:start position:0%
they actually have incredible pressure
 
03:20:55.750 --> 03:20:55.760 align:start position:0%
put on their brain and brain stem um
 
03:20:58.710 --> 03:20:58.720 align:start position:0%
this is true of a lot of braches spyic
 
03:21:02.070 --> 03:21:02.080 align:start position:0%
dogs uh apparently in a study done in
 
03:21:04.710 --> 03:21:04.720 align:start position:0%
Norway I believe
 
03:21:08.150 --> 03:21:08.160 align:start position:0%
100% 100% of King Charles cavaliers
 
03:21:10.229 --> 03:21:10.239 align:start position:0%
spaniels suffered from this to the point
 
03:21:12.229 --> 03:21:12.239 align:start position:0%
that they all all of them every
 
03:21:14.070 --> 03:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
individual had constant headaches from
 
03:21:15.590 --> 03:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
the time that they were born to the time
 
03:21:15.600 --> 03:21:16.510 align:start position:0%
the time that they were born to the time
they

03:21:16.510 --> 03:21:16.520 align:start position:0%
they
 
03:21:20.750 --> 03:21:20.760 align:start position:0%
died and this was done without care so
 
03:21:22.590 --> 03:21:22.600 align:start position:0%
because of that Norway actually banned
 
03:21:24.510 --> 03:21:24.520 align:start position:0%
the entire breed I don't think we should
 
03:21:26.189 --> 03:21:26.199 align:start position:0%
ban a breed I think we should change the
 
03:21:29.269 --> 03:21:29.279 align:start position:0%
breeding practice so that we have
 
03:21:32.269 --> 03:21:32.279 align:start position:0%
individuals that do not suffer also that
 
03:21:35.150 --> 03:21:35.160 align:start position:0%
goes along with braisy eye issues many
 
03:21:37.389 --> 03:21:37.399 align:start position:0%
of the species again all that matter
 
03:21:41.550 --> 03:21:41.560 align:start position:0%
gets pushed into a smaller skeleton so
 
03:21:42.990 --> 03:21:43.000 align:start position:0%
it doesn't go anywhere so the eyes are
 
03:21:45.349 --> 03:21:45.359 align:start position:0%
still the same but the skull is T is
 
03:21:47.950 --> 03:21:47.960 align:start position:0%
smaller so many of them have bulging
 
03:21:50.150 --> 03:21:50.160 align:start position:0%
eyes that cause eye issues many of them
 
03:21:51.870 --> 03:21:51.880 align:start position:0%
have gastrointestinal problems and throw
 
03:21:54.110 --> 03:21:54.120 align:start position:0%
up frequently many of them have nerve
 
03:21:57.349 --> 03:21:57.359 align:start position:0%
conditions skeletal conditions tear duct
 
03:21:59.389 --> 03:21:59.399 align:start position:0%
conditions they're folds of skin because
 
03:22:01.229 --> 03:22:01.239 align:start position:0%
again the skin didn't go anywhere it's
 
03:22:03.189 --> 03:22:03.199 align:start position:0%
just on a smaller skeleton so that's
 
03:22:05.070 --> 03:22:05.080 align:start position:0%
what creates those very adorable folds
 
03:22:06.309 --> 03:22:06.319 align:start position:0%
but they get
 
03:22:09.229 --> 03:22:09.239 align:start position:0%
infected um severe severe dental
 
03:22:11.830 --> 03:22:11.840 align:start position:0%
problems because again way too many and
 
03:22:13.750 --> 03:22:13.760 align:start position:0%
two large teeth on a smaller
 
03:22:16.990 --> 03:22:17.000 align:start position:0%
skull um and as a an article that was
 
03:22:18.830 --> 03:22:18.840 align:start position:0%
just covered by like less than a month
 
03:22:20.670 --> 03:22:20.680 align:start position:0%
ago it was covered by every major
 
03:22:22.550 --> 03:22:22.560 align:start position:0%
newspaper the Boston Globe New York
 
03:22:24.870 --> 03:22:24.880 align:start position:0%
Times you name it um and around the
 
03:22:27.710 --> 03:22:27.720 align:start position:0%
world in a study done out of England
 
03:22:29.790 --> 03:22:29.800 align:start position:0%
they determined that these breeds
 
03:22:32.189 --> 03:22:32.199 align:start position:0%
actually only live like seven eight
 
03:22:35.309 --> 03:22:35.319 align:start position:0%
years on average many will live longer
 
03:22:38.030 --> 03:22:38.040 align:start position:0%
but some will live much much shorter
 
03:22:40.030 --> 03:22:40.040 align:start position:0%
because again not everybody all those
 
03:22:41.510 --> 03:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
hundreds of emails you got from people
 
03:22:43.389 --> 03:22:43.399 align:start position:0%
who who thought the best things about
 
03:22:45.630 --> 03:22:45.640 align:start position:0%
these breeds but then got an individual
 
03:22:47.990 --> 03:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
bought a registered puppy and then they
 
03:22:50.150 --> 03:22:50.160 align:start position:0%
had to pay tens or in some cases
 
03:22:53.189 --> 03:22:53.199 align:start position:0%
hundreds of thousands of dollars to get
 
03:22:56.550 --> 03:22:56.560 align:start position:0%
surgery just so the animal could survive
 
03:22:58.870 --> 03:22:58.880 align:start position:0%
not everybody can afford that so some of
 
03:23:01.590 --> 03:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
these individuals don't live seven eight
 
03:23:04.910 --> 03:23:04.920 align:start position:0%
years so in smaller breeds usually the
 
03:23:07.910 --> 03:23:07.920 align:start position:0%
smaller the breed the longer lived it is
 
03:23:10.229 --> 03:23:10.239 align:start position:0%
but with these conditions these animals
 
03:23:13.269 --> 03:23:13.279 align:start position:0%
don't live even the the the life
 
03:23:18.990 --> 03:23:19.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:23.150 --> 03:23:23.160 align:start position:0%
breed so I want to connect with how this
 
03:23:23.160 --> 03:23:25.469 align:start position:0%
breed so I want to connect with how this
is

03:23:25.469 --> 03:23:25.479 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:23:29.429 --> 03:23:29.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:33.269 --> 03:23:33.279 align:start position:0%
that Madam chair I I I really
 
03:23:34.750 --> 03:23:34.760 align:start position:0%

don't know but I'm hearing very
 
03:23:40.269 --> 03:23:40.279 align:start position:0%
disrespectful comments behind me so I
 
03:23:42.030 --> 03:23:42.040 align:start position:0%
don't know if it's time to remind the
 
03:23:44.790 --> 03:23:44.800 align:start position:0%
people behind me oh I'm sorry I have not
 
03:23:47.349 --> 03:23:47.359 align:start position:0%
heard anything so but I would remind
 
03:23:50.830 --> 03:23:50.840 align:start position:0%
everybody to please um be respectful

thank you thank
 
03:23:52.359 --> 03:24:03.950 align:start position:0%
thank you thank
you

03:24:03.950 --> 03:24:03.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:06.510 --> 03:24:06.520 align:start position:0%
yeah there are some empty seats over
 
03:24:09.309 --> 03:24:09.319 align:start position:0%
here and uh in the
 
03:24:14.269 --> 03:24:14.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:16.590 --> 03:24:16.600 align:start position:0%
fine yeah there should not be anybody
 
03:24:19.670 --> 03:24:19.680 align:start position:0%
sit standing behind uh committee members
 
03:24:21.950 --> 03:24:21.960 align:start position:0%
so please find a seat or you will have
 
03:24:25.389 --> 03:24:25.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:40.550 --> 03:24:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:40.560 --> 03:24:48.790 align:start position:0%
 
here

03:24:48.790 --> 03:24:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:54.790 --> 03:24:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:56.870 --> 03:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
Reed representative Reed when you're
 
03:24:58.630 --> 03:24:58.640 align:start position:0%
ready thank you so much Madam chair I
 
03:25:01.590 --> 03:25:01.600 align:start position:0%
appreciate that
 
03:25:05.229 --> 03:25:05.239 align:start position:0%
um The Suffering that these animals face
 
03:25:08.229 --> 03:25:08.239 align:start position:0%
on a daily basis pretty much on a minute
 
03:25:11.590 --> 03:25:11.600 align:start position:0%
to minute basis is as real as the
 
03:25:14.349 --> 03:25:14.359 align:start position:0%
suffering that you could inflict by
 
03:25:19.309 --> 03:25:19.319 align:start position:0%
hitting or otherwise um obviously cruel
 
03:25:22.429 --> 03:25:22.439 align:start position:0%
actions upon your animal so if I were to
 
03:25:26.070 --> 03:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
for example strangle my dog for five
 
03:25:30.229 --> 03:25:30.239 align:start position:0%
minutes put it into a state of of panic
 
03:25:32.269 --> 03:25:32.279 align:start position:0%
make it struggle where it's trying to
 
03:25:34.229 --> 03:25:34.239 align:start position:0%
fight to get into a position where it
 
03:25:36.870 --> 03:25:36.880 align:start position:0%
can continue to breathe that would be
 
03:25:41.150 --> 03:25:41.160 align:start position:0%
cruelty and I could and would should at
 
03:25:43.110 --> 03:25:43.120 align:start position:0%
least be arrested for that and charged
 
03:25:43.120 --> 03:25:44.590 align:start position:0%
least be arrested for that and charged
with

03:25:44.590 --> 03:25:44.600 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:25:48.030 --> 03:25:48.040 align:start position:0%
it that feeling is identical to the
 
03:25:51.429 --> 03:25:51.439 align:start position:0%
feeling that these animals who are bred
 
03:25:53.950 --> 03:25:53.960 align:start position:0%
with conditions that are known to cause
 
03:25:56.469 --> 03:25:56.479 align:start position:0%
this exact kind of suffering that
 
03:25:58.469 --> 03:25:58.479 align:start position:0%
feeling is identical and so to
 
03:26:01.189 --> 03:26:01.199 align:start position:0%
intentionally create an animal that will
 
03:26:03.429 --> 03:26:03.439 align:start position:0%
live its entire life with a condition
 
03:26:06.830 --> 03:26:06.840 align:start position:0%
like this is the same cruelty as
 
03:26:09.870 --> 03:26:09.880 align:start position:0%
purposely inflicting pain after the
 
03:26:12.790 --> 03:26:12.800 align:start position:0%
animal is born it's the same pain the
 
03:26:12.800 --> 03:26:15.670 align:start position:0%
animal is born it's the same pain the
same

03:26:15.670 --> 03:26:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:18.590 --> 03:26:18.600 align:start position:0%
intentionality of course that is
 
03:26:21.229 --> 03:26:21.239 align:start position:0%
cruelty now as far as
 
03:26:23.510 --> 03:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
opposition I knew that when I put this
 
03:26:26.110 --> 03:26:26.120 align:start position:0%
in it is not the first push like this
 
03:26:28.389 --> 03:26:28.399 align:start position:0%
but it is the first state level push
 
03:26:30.469 --> 03:26:30.479 align:start position:0%
there have been many um countries that
 
03:26:32.630 --> 03:26:32.640 align:start position:0%
have gone after this in fact the term is
 
03:26:35.229 --> 03:26:35.239 align:start position:0%
called torture breeding uh countries on
 
03:26:37.750 --> 03:26:37.760 align:start position:0%
different levels have uh Netherlands and
 
03:26:40.469 --> 03:26:40.479 align:start position:0%
Norway I already mentioned have gone
 
03:26:42.469 --> 03:26:42.479 align:start position:0%
after torture breeding breeding of
 
03:26:44.950 --> 03:26:44.960 align:start position:0%
animals to intentionally to have
 
03:26:46.670 --> 03:26:46.680 align:start position:0%
characteristics that they know will
 
03:26:49.550 --> 03:26:49.560 align:start position:0%
cause suffering um also different
 
03:26:51.830 --> 03:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
municipalities across this country it's
 
03:26:54.269 --> 03:26:54.279 align:start position:0%
also like I said there are new breed
 
03:26:55.790 --> 03:26:55.800 align:start position:0%
Registries with healthier breed
 
03:26:58.389 --> 03:26:58.399 align:start position:0%
standards that are trying to push uh
 
03:27:03.070 --> 03:27:03.080 align:start position:0%
these breeds back to a a healthier
 
03:27:07.590 --> 03:27:07.600 align:start position:0%
version but I understand that um that
 
03:27:09.910 --> 03:27:09.920 align:start position:0%
putting this in being the the first time
 
03:27:11.910 --> 03:27:11.920 align:start position:0%
this is being done on the state level
 
03:27:15.110 --> 03:27:15.120 align:start position:0%
is uh shocking and perhaps upsetting to
 
03:27:17.950 --> 03:27:17.960 align:start position:0%
many people um especially people who are
 
03:27:21.349 --> 03:27:21.359 align:start position:0%
in the breeding community so breeders
 
03:27:23.990 --> 03:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
Registries and reproductive
 
03:27:26.030 --> 03:27:26.040 align:start position:0%
veterinarians I did mention that many of
 
03:27:28.830 --> 03:27:28.840 align:start position:0%
these breeds cannot breed on their own
 
03:27:30.830 --> 03:27:30.840 align:start position:0%
they cannot reproduce on their own so a
 
03:27:32.990 --> 03:27:33.000 align:start position:0%
lot of these breeds are almost entirely
 
03:27:36.030 --> 03:27:36.040 align:start position:0%
dependent on veterinarians to assist
 
03:27:38.389 --> 03:27:38.399 align:start position:0%
with either artificial insemination and
 
03:27:42.269 --> 03:27:42.279 align:start position:0%
or um C-sections because they can't give
 
03:27:45.590 --> 03:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
birth so I understand that community and
 
03:27:47.510 --> 03:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
this is normal for them like I said once
 
03:27:49.550 --> 03:27:49.560 align:start position:0%
upon a time it was normal for me I
 
03:27:51.990 --> 03:27:52.000 align:start position:0%
didn't question it either but I'm really
 
03:27:54.630 --> 03:27:54.640 align:start position:0%
hoping that people who say that they
 
03:27:56.189 --> 03:27:56.199 align:start position:0%
care about their animal because you will
 
03:27:59.670 --> 03:27:59.680 align:start position:0%
get I think you said about 50 people
 
03:28:02.630 --> 03:28:02.640 align:start position:0%
coming up to say they love their animal
 
03:28:04.590 --> 03:28:04.600 align:start position:0%
I'm really hoping that they will open
 
03:28:07.229 --> 03:28:07.239 align:start position:0%
their hearts and kind of drop the you
 
03:28:09.030 --> 03:28:09.040 align:start position:0%
know we come into these committee rooms
 
03:28:12.550 --> 03:28:12.560 align:start position:0%
with a lot of defensiveness a lot of you
 
03:28:14.790 --> 03:28:14.800 align:start position:0%
know presumptions about the other and
 
03:28:17.150 --> 03:28:17.160 align:start position:0%
the enemy I'm hoping that people who
 
03:28:19.469 --> 03:28:19.479 align:start position:0%
truly love their animals will just stop
 
03:28:21.710 --> 03:28:21.720 align:start position:0%
and let this in that if you
 
03:28:23.750 --> 03:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
intentionally breed a characteristic
 
03:28:26.389 --> 03:28:26.399 align:start position:0%
that you know will cause this problem
 
03:28:28.269 --> 03:28:28.279 align:start position:0%
then that is not a loving action and
 
03:28:30.469 --> 03:28:30.479 align:start position:0%
there are ways to do it better it's not
 
03:28:32.150 --> 03:28:32.160 align:start position:0%
like you know you have to give it up
 
03:28:34.309 --> 03:28:34.319 align:start position:0%
give up the breed give up breeding you
 
03:28:36.309 --> 03:28:36.319 align:start position:0%
can do it but you can do it
 
03:28:38.550 --> 03:28:38.560 align:start position:0%
better so some of the opposition you
 
03:28:38.560 --> 03:28:39.309 align:start position:0%
better so some of the opposition you
will

03:28:39.309 --> 03:28:39.319 align:start position:0%
will
 
03:28:42.070 --> 03:28:42.080 align:start position:0%
hear um and like I said almost all of
 
03:28:44.469 --> 03:28:44.479 align:start position:0%
whom will have a a personal
 
03:28:47.269 --> 03:28:47.279 align:start position:0%
representative uh Reed I would caution
 
03:28:50.950 --> 03:28:50.960 align:start position:0%
you um on supposing what people may or
 
03:28:53.710 --> 03:28:53.720 align:start position:0%
may not say and I would hope that you
 
03:28:56.990 --> 03:28:57.000 align:start position:0%
would stick to um the purpose and
 
03:28:59.950 --> 03:28:59.960 align:start position:0%
intention of your bill and steer away
 
03:29:01.870 --> 03:29:01.880 align:start position:0%
from what you think people may or may
 
03:29:04.910 --> 03:29:04.920 align:start position:0%
say in their testimony or what they may
 
03:29:07.469 --> 03:29:07.479 align:start position:0%
or may say in defense or in support of
 
03:29:09.550 --> 03:29:09.560 align:start position:0%
this bill I appreciate that comment
 
03:29:11.349 --> 03:29:11.359 align:start position:0%
Madam chair as you know it is standard
 
03:29:15.070 --> 03:29:15.080 align:start position:0%
practice to um um address opposition
 
03:29:17.110 --> 03:29:17.120 align:start position:0%
since I will not have a chance to come
 
03:29:18.750 --> 03:29:18.760 align:start position:0%
back at the end and address the
 
03:29:21.510 --> 03:29:21.520 align:start position:0%
opposition also this is not supposed
 
03:29:23.469 --> 03:29:23.479 align:start position:0%
this is based on social media posts
 
03:29:24.710 --> 03:29:24.720 align:start position:0%
letters that the committee has heard
 
03:29:27.630 --> 03:29:27.640 align:start position:0%
that I was copy that I was copied on and
 
03:29:30.189 --> 03:29:30.199 align:start position:0%
um articles so these are things I've
 
03:29:31.910 --> 03:29:31.920 align:start position:0%
already seen as
 
03:29:37.030 --> 03:29:37.040 align:start position:0%
arguments thank you so um most of the
 
03:29:39.710 --> 03:29:39.720 align:start position:0%
opposition again many of whom have a
 
03:29:41.429 --> 03:29:41.439 align:start position:0%
financial interest in continuing
 
03:29:45.710 --> 03:29:45.720 align:start position:0%
breeding as they do um but you will hear
 
03:29:48.710 --> 03:29:48.720 align:start position:0%
that first of all
 
03:29:48.720 --> 03:29:51.229 align:start position:0%
that first of all
um

03:29:51.229 --> 03:29:51.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:29:53.870 --> 03:29:53.880 align:start position:0%
sorry that their dogs are healthy if
 
03:29:55.469 --> 03:29:55.479 align:start position:0%
their dogs are healthy this doesn't
 
03:29:57.590 --> 03:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
impact them because again the language
 
03:30:00.950 --> 03:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
of the bill specifically is preventing
 
03:30:02.710 --> 03:30:02.720 align:start position:0%
breeding two individual not even just
 
03:30:04.550 --> 03:30:04.560 align:start position:0%
one like you could still have breed one
 
03:30:06.469 --> 03:30:06.479 align:start position:0%
individual with a deformity that causes
 
03:30:08.630 --> 03:30:08.640 align:start position:0%
suffering but you just can't breed two
 
03:30:10.309 --> 03:30:10.319 align:start position:0%
that have the same deformity that causes
 
03:30:10.319 --> 03:30:11.910 align:start position:0%
that have the same deformity that causes
suffering

03:30:11.910 --> 03:30:11.920 align:start position:0%
suffering
 
03:30:13.429 --> 03:30:13.439 align:start position:0%
so if their animals are healthy and
 
03:30:14.830 --> 03:30:14.840 align:start position:0%
they're doing it the right way and
 
03:30:17.110 --> 03:30:17.120 align:start position:0%
they're not suffering then this bill
 
03:30:18.630 --> 03:30:18.640 align:start position:0%
does not impact
 
03:30:21.870 --> 03:30:21.880 align:start position:0%
them they also say they love their
 
03:30:25.269 --> 03:30:25.279 align:start position:0%
animals and I'm happy to hear that but
 
03:30:27.110 --> 03:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
if if they know what they're doing is
 
03:30:29.750 --> 03:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
causing suffering then I would argue
 
03:30:32.269 --> 03:30:32.279 align:start position:0%
that I have greater love because I don't
 
03:30:35.590 --> 03:30:35.600 align:start position:0%
want them to cause suffering to those
 
03:30:38.990 --> 03:30:39.000 align:start position:0%
animals some will argue I've seen this
 
03:30:41.110 --> 03:30:41.120 align:start position:0%
that it's unconstitutional I I don't
 
03:30:42.950 --> 03:30:42.960 align:start position:0%
think there's any kind of um legal
 
03:30:44.750 --> 03:30:44.760 align:start position:0%
background to that whatsoever obviously
 
03:30:47.189 --> 03:30:47.199 align:start position:0%
we do all kinds of laws especially and
 
03:30:49.550 --> 03:30:49.560 align:start position:0%
regarding animals and what is
 
03:30:55.150 --> 03:30:55.160 align:start position:0%
cruelty um I I I as a as a teacher of
 
03:30:57.870 --> 03:30:57.880 align:start position:0%
the United States Constitution um I can
 
03:30:59.710 --> 03:30:59.720 align:start position:0%
say there's nothing in the Constitution
 
03:31:02.349 --> 03:31:02.359 align:start position:0%
regarding animal breeding
 
03:31:05.070 --> 03:31:05.080 align:start position:0%
practices um and some will actually
 
03:31:06.510 --> 03:31:06.520 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that there is a severe
 
03:31:08.510 --> 03:31:08.520 align:start position:0%
problem because there is a severe
 
03:31:11.510 --> 03:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
problem it's really undeniable um
 
03:31:13.349 --> 03:31:13.359 align:start position:0%
but they will say that the the answer is
 
03:31:15.469 --> 03:31:15.479 align:start position:0%
not to legislate it the answer is
 
03:31:17.790 --> 03:31:17.800 align:start position:0%
education um and private breed
 
03:31:20.550 --> 03:31:20.560 align:start position:0%
Registries changing their uh
 
03:31:22.469 --> 03:31:22.479 align:start position:0%
confirmation standards which I hope they
 
03:31:25.189 --> 03:31:25.199 align:start position:0%
do but we know that that has not worked
 
03:31:28.550 --> 03:31:28.560 align:start position:0%
in fact that the the trajectory has been
 
03:31:31.110 --> 03:31:31.120 align:start position:0%
continually to get more and more extreme
 
03:31:33.349 --> 03:31:33.359 align:start position:0%
because again those extreme
 
03:31:35.670 --> 03:31:35.680 align:start position:0%
Aesthetics the more extreme you are the
 
03:31:37.950 --> 03:31:37.960 align:start position:0%
more desirable which means you can
 
03:31:39.790 --> 03:31:39.800 align:start position:0%
charge more for the
 
03:31:42.229 --> 03:31:42.239 align:start position:0%
progyny they do have they have created
 
03:31:44.349 --> 03:31:44.359 align:start position:0%
an an independent grading system
 
03:31:46.830 --> 03:31:46.840 align:start position:0%
specifically for the boas the breathing
 
03:31:51.429 --> 03:31:51.439 align:start position:0%
issues um but too too too few individual
 
03:31:53.990 --> 03:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
dogs are graded according to that most
 
03:31:56.229 --> 03:31:56.239 align:start position:0%
breeders don't test them according to
 
03:31:59.469 --> 03:31:59.479 align:start position:0%
that scale I applaud the ones that do um
 
03:32:02.630 --> 03:32:02.640 align:start position:0%
and that do and then only breed dogs
 
03:32:06.110 --> 03:32:06.120 align:start position:0%
that but again the breathing is only one
 
03:32:09.510 --> 03:32:09.520 align:start position:0%
aspect of braisy there's many many many
 
03:32:11.630 --> 03:32:11.640 align:start position:0%
it turns out when you shorten a
 
03:32:13.269 --> 03:32:13.279 align:start position:0%
and don't shorten everything else that
 
03:32:15.189 --> 03:32:15.199 align:start position:0%
goes along in the body there are a lot
 
03:32:16.790 --> 03:32:16.800 align:start position:0%
of problems with
 
03:32:21.030 --> 03:32:21.040 align:start position:0%
that and braisy is just one of very many
 
03:32:22.990 --> 03:32:23.000 align:start position:0%
different problems that very many
 
03:32:24.830 --> 03:32:24.840 align:start position:0%
different breeds have because of the
 
03:32:27.469 --> 03:32:27.479 align:start position:0%
ever never-ending pursuit of those
 
03:32:27.479 --> 03:32:33.469 align:start position:0%
ever never-ending pursuit of those
extreme

03:32:33.469 --> 03:32:33.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:37.790 --> 03:32:37.800 align:start position:0%
confirmations so I I really really
 
03:32:40.830 --> 03:32:40.840 align:start position:0%
hope that the people in the room who
 
03:32:44.229 --> 03:32:44.239 align:start position:0%
maybe came in with perhaps anger I don't
 
03:32:47.229 --> 03:32:47.239 align:start position:0%
know defensiveness I don't know can kind
 
03:32:50.830 --> 03:32:50.840 align:start position:0%
of hear what the intent here is and kind
 
03:32:53.590 --> 03:32:53.600 align:start position:0%
of hear what the science behind now
 
03:32:56.349 --> 03:32:56.359 align:start position:0%
forget the science forget the science it
 
03:33:00.309 --> 03:33:00.319 align:start position:0%
says a deformity that causes suffering
 
03:33:02.790 --> 03:33:02.800 align:start position:0%
that's all you need to hear if you are
 
03:33:04.630 --> 03:33:04.640 align:start position:0%
intentionally creating a deformity that
 
03:33:07.910 --> 03:33:07.920 align:start position:0%
causes suffering how can that be okay I
 
03:33:10.110 --> 03:33:10.120 align:start position:0%
think anyone who comes up and goes I
 
03:33:13.510 --> 03:33:13.520 align:start position:0%
should be allowed to do that I do that I
 
03:33:14.990 --> 03:33:15.000 align:start position:0%
intentionally create deformities that
 
03:33:17.429 --> 03:33:17.439 align:start position:0%
cause suffering in animals I do that and
 
03:33:19.550 --> 03:33:19.560 align:start position:0%
I want to keep doing that if anyone
 
03:33:21.630 --> 03:33:21.640 align:start position:0%
essentially says that they are telling
 
03:33:23.990 --> 03:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
on themselves they are telling on
 
03:33:27.630 --> 03:33:27.640 align:start position:0%
themselves so in closing I would just
 
03:33:30.510 --> 03:33:30.520 align:start position:0%
like to say that it's obviously cruelty
 
03:33:32.590 --> 03:33:32.600 align:start position:0%
to intentionally inflict suffering on an
 
03:33:35.510 --> 03:33:35.520 align:start position:0%
animal whether it's from its birth or
 
03:33:37.990 --> 03:33:38.000 align:start position:0%
afterwards and we legislate against
 
03:33:41.229 --> 03:33:41.239 align:start position:0%
cruelty because it's unethical and and
 
03:33:43.429 --> 03:33:43.439 align:start position:0%
we have to we we have to do the right
 
03:33:45.389 --> 03:33:45.399 align:start position:0%
thing as
 
03:33:47.870 --> 03:33:47.880 align:start position:0%
legislators so I'm happy to take
 
03:33:50.550 --> 03:33:50.560 align:start position:0%
questions but I ask that you um fairly
 
03:33:53.790 --> 03:33:53.800 align:start position:0%
and openly consider
 
03:33:58.070 --> 03:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:00.670 --> 03:34:00.680 align:start position:0%
ktoa thank you madam chair and thank you
 
03:34:02.990 --> 03:34:03.000 align:start position:0%
representative for being here um and
 
03:34:03.000 --> 03:34:04.910 align:start position:0%
representative for being here um and
testifying

03:34:04.910 --> 03:34:04.920 align:start position:0%
testifying
 
03:34:07.910 --> 03:34:07.920 align:start position:0%
um would you know at a young age that
 
03:34:09.670 --> 03:34:09.680 align:start position:0%
these animals are not
 
03:34:12.870 --> 03:34:12.880 align:start position:0%
healthy in some cases you might and in
 
03:34:15.630 --> 03:34:15.640 align:start position:0%
some cases you might not I'm not sure
 
03:34:17.030 --> 03:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
but you do know by the time that they
 
03:34:18.830 --> 03:34:18.840 align:start position:0%
are breeding age again I have a
 
03:34:20.469 --> 03:34:20.479 align:start position:0%
veterinarian that would be happy to
 
03:34:23.790 --> 03:34:23.800 align:start position:0%
answer more thoroughly follow follow up
 
03:34:26.229 --> 03:34:26.239 align:start position:0%
so what you're saying is as a puppy when
 
03:34:27.510 --> 03:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
they're three months old or something
 
03:34:29.429 --> 03:34:29.439 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't know that they're having a
 
03:34:29.439 --> 03:34:30.630 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't know that they're having a
breathing

03:34:30.630 --> 03:34:30.640 align:start position:0%
breathing
 
03:34:33.349 --> 03:34:33.359 align:start position:0%
issue for severe breathing breathing
 
03:34:36.389 --> 03:34:36.399 align:start position:0%
issues I imagine that you actually would
 
03:34:38.469 --> 03:34:38.479 align:start position:0%
right um but again I'm not a
 
03:34:40.269 --> 03:34:40.279 align:start position:0%
veterinarian and I do have one that can
 
03:34:42.389 --> 03:34:42.399 align:start position:0%
answer more thoroughly having said that
 
03:34:44.630 --> 03:34:44.640 align:start position:0%
I want to be very clear this is not at
 
03:34:47.309 --> 03:34:47.319 align:start position:0%
all about going after breeders who sold
 
03:34:49.030 --> 03:34:49.040 align:start position:0%
their puppies and then later there was a
 
03:34:51.510 --> 03:34:51.520 align:start position:0%
condition found that's I understand a
 
03:34:53.229 --> 03:34:53.239 align:start position:0%
lot of people have come to this issue
 
03:34:55.189 --> 03:34:55.199 align:start position:0%
because that's what happened to them but
 
03:34:57.670 --> 03:34:57.680 align:start position:0%
this isn't giving like a ride of like
 
03:35:00.590 --> 03:35:00.600 align:start position:0%
civil action against a breeder this is
 
03:35:04.070 --> 03:35:04.080 align:start position:0%
just saying once they're breeding age
 
03:35:06.030 --> 03:35:06.040 align:start position:0%
you cannot intentionally that means
 
03:35:07.870 --> 03:35:07.880 align:start position:0%
knowingly as in you know what the
 
03:35:10.429 --> 03:35:10.439 align:start position:0%
condition is and these animals have that
 
03:35:12.710 --> 03:35:12.720 align:start position:0%
condition and you know it breed two
 
03:35:15.389 --> 03:35:15.399 align:start position:0%
individuals with identical deformities
 
03:35:18.110 --> 03:35:18.120 align:start position:0%
deformities so not any other condition
 
03:35:20.510 --> 03:35:20.520 align:start position:0%
deformities that cause
 
03:35:23.990 --> 03:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
suffering representative kto thank you
 
03:35:25.870 --> 03:35:25.880 align:start position:0%
yes please thank you m Madam chair and
 
03:35:27.950 --> 03:35:27.960 align:start position:0%
thank you again so I'm just looking at
 
03:35:30.830 --> 03:35:30.840 align:start position:0%
the language because it says so if you
 
03:35:32.950 --> 03:35:32.960 align:start position:0%
sell an animal that has a birth
 
03:35:34.950 --> 03:35:34.960 align:start position:0%
deformity that causes suffering you're
 
03:35:39.389 --> 03:35:39.399 align:start position:0%
in violation of this um your you're it's
 
03:35:42.030 --> 03:35:42.040 align:start position:0%
considered animal cruelty even if you
 
03:35:43.550 --> 03:35:43.560 align:start position:0%
don't know that the
 
03:35:46.550 --> 03:35:46.560 align:start position:0%
animal has a birth deformity according
 
03:35:50.269 --> 03:35:50.279 align:start position:0%
to this or you intentionally breed which
 
03:35:53.389 --> 03:35:53.399 align:start position:0%
that part I can understand um with the
 
03:35:56.150 --> 03:35:56.160 align:start position:0%
intent to sell two individual animals of
 
03:35:58.910 --> 03:35:58.920 align:start position:0%
the same birth deformity but if you sell
 
03:36:00.469 --> 03:36:00.479 align:start position:0%
an animal that has a birth deformity
 
03:36:04.349 --> 03:36:04.359 align:start position:0%
that causes suffering and you sell it
 
03:36:06.790 --> 03:36:06.800 align:start position:0%
unknowingly you're still guilty is that
 
03:36:09.229 --> 03:36:09.239 align:start position:0%
correct thank you so much representative
 
03:36:11.710 --> 03:36:11.720 align:start position:0%
for pointing out that I had the as you
 
03:36:13.429 --> 03:36:13.439 align:start position:0%
may know in criminal justice law there
 
03:36:16.550 --> 03:36:16.560 align:start position:0%
are four mental states of C
 
03:36:20.070 --> 03:36:20.080 align:start position:0%
culpability um and that whilst the
 
03:36:22.229 --> 03:36:22.239 align:start position:0%
intentional was put on the breeding that
 
03:36:24.110 --> 03:36:24.120 align:start position:0%
it was skipped on the birth deformity
 
03:36:25.790 --> 03:36:25.800 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to add that and I'm glad to
 
03:36:27.469 --> 03:36:27.479 align:start position:0%
hear that you're likely to support it if
 
03:36:27.479 --> 03:36:29.830 align:start position:0%
hear that you're likely to support it if
I

03:36:29.830 --> 03:36:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:31.950 --> 03:36:31.960 align:start position:0%
do representative
 
03:36:34.550 --> 03:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
kulan thank you for taking my question
 
03:36:36.710 --> 03:36:36.720 align:start position:0%
and thank you madam chair just to stick
 
03:36:39.150 --> 03:36:39.160 align:start position:0%
to the subject matter I'm hearing the
 
03:36:41.070 --> 03:36:41.080 align:start position:0%
word suffering a lot
 
03:36:44.910 --> 03:36:44.920 align:start position:0%
and with relation to boas like who is
 
03:36:47.030 --> 03:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
going to determine suffering in like
 
03:36:48.910 --> 03:36:48.920 align:start position:0%
each individual case would it be the
 
03:36:50.990 --> 03:36:51.000 align:start position:0%
courts who's going to figure it out
 
03:36:52.309 --> 03:36:52.319 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I did
 
03:36:55.070 --> 03:36:55.080 align:start position:0%
struggle with putting this language in
 
03:36:59.910 --> 03:36:59.920 align:start position:0%
how um how specific to get and you may
 
03:37:03.110 --> 03:37:03.120 align:start position:0%
recall me being here a few weeks back
 
03:37:06.590 --> 03:37:06.600 align:start position:0%
the debate on um how specific versus how
 
03:37:09.790 --> 03:37:09.800 align:start position:0%
broad do we write language um and it is
 
03:37:12.990 --> 03:37:13.000 align:start position:0%
always very intentional like balance
 
03:37:15.269 --> 03:37:15.279 align:start position:0%
between intentional ambiguity and
 
03:37:17.269 --> 03:37:17.279 align:start position:0%
specificity um at that point I was
 
03:37:20.309 --> 03:37:20.319 align:start position:0%
arguing about listing specific um like I
 
03:37:22.389 --> 03:37:22.399 align:start position:0%
did with braisy here as an example
 
03:37:25.150 --> 03:37:25.160 align:start position:0%
listing specific um other practices that
 
03:37:28.429 --> 03:37:28.439 align:start position:0%
were cruelty um and I was uh the
 
03:37:30.150 --> 03:37:30.160 align:start position:0%
argument against that was that we
 
03:37:32.070 --> 03:37:32.080 align:start position:0%
already have a very broad vague
 
03:37:33.710 --> 03:37:33.720 align:start position:0%
definition of Cruelty that includes the
 
03:37:36.150 --> 03:37:36.160 align:start position:0%
word mutilation of course we don't ever
 
03:37:38.630 --> 03:37:38.640 align:start position:0%
apply that to things like declawing or
 
03:37:40.389 --> 03:37:40.399 align:start position:0%
ear cropping or tail docking we don't
 
03:37:42.229 --> 03:37:42.239 align:start position:0%
consider that so that is the danger of
 
03:37:45.750 --> 03:37:45.760 align:start position:0%
being too broad and too vague um and of
 
03:37:46.830 --> 03:37:46.840 align:start position:0%
course the problem with being too
 
03:37:48.070 --> 03:37:48.080 align:start position:0%
specific is that you might leave
 
03:37:50.550 --> 03:37:50.560 align:start position:0%
something out I went with this and I'm
 
03:37:52.630 --> 03:37:52.640 align:start position:0%
happy to go and get the medical
 
03:37:54.630 --> 03:37:54.640 align:start position:0%
community definition of suffering if
 
03:37:57.269 --> 03:37:57.279 align:start position:0%
that's what the committee will support
 
03:37:59.510 --> 03:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
um but I went with this because it's
 
03:38:01.750 --> 03:38:01.760 align:start position:0%
cleaner because I find that when I argue
 
03:38:03.630 --> 03:38:03.640 align:start position:0%
for a bill in committee if I get too
 
03:38:05.309 --> 03:38:05.319 align:start position:0%
specific then the specifics get
 
03:38:06.910 --> 03:38:06.920 align:start position:0%
questioned and if I'm too broad then the
 
03:38:09.229 --> 03:38:09.239 align:start position:0%
broadness is questioned and often times
 
03:38:11.670 --> 03:38:11.680 align:start position:0%
no matter what I provide and what was
 
03:38:15.150 --> 03:38:15.160 align:start position:0%
asked really whoever was asking for that
 
03:38:17.830 --> 03:38:17.840 align:start position:0%
was just against it to begin with um and
 
03:38:18.990 --> 03:38:19.000 align:start position:0%
and there's no way to make that
 
03:38:22.229 --> 03:38:22.239 align:start position:0%
individual happy so um if the committee
 
03:38:24.630 --> 03:38:24.640 align:start position:0%
you or anybody else would prefer like
 
03:38:27.990 --> 03:38:28.000 align:start position:0%
say a medical community's definition of
 
03:38:30.750 --> 03:38:30.760 align:start position:0%
uh suffering or say like a doctor's
 
03:38:32.950 --> 03:38:32.960 align:start position:0%
letter a doctor's statement or an
 
03:38:35.710 --> 03:38:35.720 align:start position:0%
assessment um or a judge however you
 
03:38:37.389 --> 03:38:37.399 align:start position:0%
want to go about that I'm happy to do
 
03:38:39.349 --> 03:38:39.359 align:start position:0%
that because I just want to get at the
 
03:38:40.910 --> 03:38:40.920 align:start position:0%
suffering that's being being inflicted
 
03:38:40.920 --> 03:38:42.429 align:start position:0%
suffering that's being being inflicted
on

03:38:42.429 --> 03:38:42.439 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:38:46.830 --> 03:38:46.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:49.110 --> 03:38:49.120 align:start position:0%
Penza thank you for taking my question
 
03:38:51.269 --> 03:38:51.279 align:start position:0%
so it might be the veterinarian that
 
03:38:53.150 --> 03:38:53.160 align:start position:0%
would answer this but it kind of Falls
 
03:38:56.910 --> 03:38:56.920 align:start position:0%
underneath representative ktoa if right
 
03:38:59.550 --> 03:38:59.560 align:start position:0%
now if someone if a breeder sells that
 
03:39:03.670 --> 03:39:03.680 align:start position:0%
animal and it has um that kind of
 
03:39:05.510 --> 03:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
breathing deformity let's just use that
 
03:39:08.110 --> 03:39:08.120 align:start position:0%
one um
 
03:39:11.150 --> 03:39:11.160 align:start position:0%
upon um upon purchase of
 
03:39:13.510 --> 03:39:13.520 align:start position:0%
is there something you know are they are
 
03:39:14.910 --> 03:39:14.920 align:start position:0%
they able to get a health certificate
 
03:39:17.429 --> 03:39:17.439 align:start position:0%
for example right now if that if they
 
03:39:18.990 --> 03:39:19.000 align:start position:0%
have that breathing
 
03:39:21.950 --> 03:39:21.960 align:start position:0%
deformity so yeah I think maybe the the
 
03:39:24.150 --> 03:39:24.160 align:start position:0%
vet might be better able to answer that
 
03:39:27.710 --> 03:39:27.720 align:start position:0%
but really what we find because again um
 
03:39:29.950 --> 03:39:29.960 align:start position:0%
even with breed Registries very
 
03:39:33.189 --> 03:39:33.199 align:start position:0%
frequently they have an internal like
 
03:39:35.630 --> 03:39:35.640 align:start position:0%
grading system or what have you in order
 
03:39:37.510 --> 03:39:37.520 align:start position:0%
to register that
 
03:39:40.630 --> 03:39:40.640 align:start position:0%
individual however as representative
 
03:39:42.469 --> 03:39:42.479 align:start position:0%
comah pointed out you may not know that
 
03:39:46.189 --> 03:39:46.199 align:start position:0%
as a as a baby but also I hear and I'm
 
03:39:47.910 --> 03:39:47.920 align:start position:0%
not a breeder so I can't speak
 
03:39:50.189 --> 03:39:50.199 align:start position:0%
specifically to this I hear that you
 
03:39:51.990 --> 03:39:52.000 align:start position:0%
know it's not like a doctor that
 
03:39:54.189 --> 03:39:54.199 align:start position:0%
literally comes out and like tests it
 
03:39:56.950 --> 03:39:56.960 align:start position:0%
for all the wide range of conditions
 
03:40:00.790 --> 03:40:00.800 align:start position:0%
that could possibly exist so you know I
 
03:40:03.070 --> 03:40:03.080 align:start position:0%
I what I'm arguing is that the breed
 
03:40:05.670 --> 03:40:05.680 align:start position:0%
Registries do have an incentive to go
 
03:40:08.150 --> 03:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
ahead and certify and certify ever more
 
03:40:10.750 --> 03:40:10.760 align:start position:0%
extreme confirmations and and that
 
03:40:14.630 --> 03:40:14.640 align:start position:0%
incentive kind of uh goes against maybe
 
03:40:16.750 --> 03:40:16.760 align:start position:0%
valuing the health of the
 
03:40:20.630 --> 03:40:20.640 align:start position:0%
animal representative Davis and then
 
03:40:22.910 --> 03:40:22.920 align:start position:0%
Bixby thank you madam chair and thank
 
03:40:25.550 --> 03:40:25.560 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question uh so far
 
03:40:28.349 --> 03:40:28.359 align:start position:0%
we've we've talked only about uh animals
 
03:40:30.870 --> 03:40:30.880 align:start position:0%
that that have potential breathing
 
03:40:33.389 --> 03:40:33.399 align:start position:0%
issues now how about hip displacer or or
 
03:40:35.910 --> 03:40:35.920 align:start position:0%
larger breeds that are susceptible to
 
03:40:38.510 --> 03:40:38.520 align:start position:0%
heart problems and short-lived you know
 
03:40:41.269 --> 03:40:41.279 align:start position:0%
we're talking how how would that affect
 
03:40:44.309 --> 03:40:44.319 align:start position:0%
this so it has to be a deformity and if
 
03:40:46.070 --> 03:40:46.080 align:start position:0%
this committee really wanted to get more
 
03:40:47.910 --> 03:40:47.920 align:start position:0%
expansive than this bill then I would
 
03:40:49.229 --> 03:40:49.239 align:start position:0%
support that too but it has to be a
 
03:40:51.469 --> 03:40:51.479 align:start position:0%
deformity and it has to cause suffering
 
03:40:53.510 --> 03:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
so not necessar a short life isn't
 
03:40:56.550 --> 03:40:56.560 align:start position:0%
necessarily suffering um because they're
 
03:40:58.790 --> 03:40:58.800 align:start position:0%
like Great Danes only live like seven
 
03:41:02.389 --> 03:41:02.399 align:start position:0%
years right versus a smaller breed which
 
03:41:06.030 --> 03:41:06.040 align:start position:0%
might could live like 20 so um as far as
 
03:41:08.590 --> 03:41:08.600 align:start position:0%
hip dysplasia or those extreme sloping
 
03:41:11.150 --> 03:41:11.160 align:start position:0%
backs or extremely long backs of other
 
03:41:13.910 --> 03:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
breeds I'm certainly not like trying to
 
03:41:16.510 --> 03:41:16.520 align:start position:0%
pick on any particular breed all of that
 
03:41:18.429 --> 03:41:18.439 align:start position:0%
should be covered if it's causing like
 
03:41:20.229 --> 03:41:20.239 align:start position:0%
with the very long backs a lot of times
 
03:41:22.229 --> 03:41:22.239 align:start position:0%
that you know people human beings get
 
03:41:24.670 --> 03:41:24.680 align:start position:0%
back pain the longer your back is the
 
03:41:26.830 --> 03:41:26.840 align:start position:0%
more likely you're going to have extreme
 
03:41:29.710 --> 03:41:29.720 align:start position:0%
back pain and if you were born with a
 
03:41:32.070 --> 03:41:32.080 align:start position:0%
ridiculously long back intentionally
 
03:41:34.630 --> 03:41:34.640 align:start position:0%
bred to have an like a back much much
 
03:41:36.550 --> 03:41:36.560 align:start position:0%
longer than your legs you're likely
 
03:41:39.229 --> 03:41:39.239 align:start position:0%
going to have lots of lots of back pain
 
03:41:40.870 --> 03:41:40.880 align:start position:0%
so yeah that should all be covered
 
03:41:42.110 --> 03:41:42.120 align:start position:0%
because those are deformities that cause
 
03:41:43.990 --> 03:41:44.000 align:start position:0%
suffering but again could there be
 
03:41:46.429 --> 03:41:46.439 align:start position:0%
individuals within that breed that don't
 
03:41:48.229 --> 03:41:48.239 align:start position:0%
have that suffering yeah and then you
 
03:41:50.349 --> 03:41:50.359 align:start position:0%
could breed those like I said with the
 
03:41:52.870 --> 03:41:52.880 align:start position:0%
boas specifically with French Bulldogs
 
03:41:55.990 --> 03:41:56.000 align:start position:0%
90% of French bulldogs suffer from boas
 
03:41:58.750 --> 03:41:58.760 align:start position:0%
some level of boas but that means 10%
 
03:42:01.510 --> 03:42:01.520 align:start position:0%
don't so you can bre the 10% and bring
 
03:42:05.830 --> 03:42:05.840 align:start position:0%
in new genetic um uh individuals for for
 
03:42:08.510 --> 03:42:08.520 align:start position:0%
uh more genetic a larger genetic pool to
 
03:42:11.149 --> 03:42:11.159 align:start position:0%
make that breed healthier
 
03:42:11.159 --> 03:42:12.269 align:start position:0%
make that breed healthier
representative

03:42:12.269 --> 03:42:12.279 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:42:15.269 --> 03:42:15.279 align:start position:0%
Bixby so I'm wondering how this is going
 
03:42:16.990 --> 03:42:17.000 align:start position:0%
to be
 
03:42:19.550 --> 03:42:19.560 align:start position:0%
enforced thank you for the question
 
03:42:22.750 --> 03:42:22.760 align:start position:0%
representative um I find that you asked
 
03:42:24.590 --> 03:42:24.600 align:start position:0%
that question a
 
03:42:29.790 --> 03:42:29.800 align:start position:0%
lot so I foresee it being enforced uh
 
03:42:32.870 --> 03:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
the way that we enforce many things that
 
03:42:35.990 --> 03:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
kind of are potentially vague especially
 
03:42:38.510 --> 03:42:38.520 align:start position:0%
a lot of Cruelty issues so it it does
 
03:42:41.030 --> 03:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
fall down to people reporting
 
03:42:43.229 --> 03:42:43.239 align:start position:0%
um and that's true of a lot it's true of
 
03:42:45.429 --> 03:42:45.439 align:start position:0%
domestic violence it's true of a lot of
 
03:42:47.790 --> 03:42:47.800 align:start position:0%
things that people have to report what
 
03:42:50.309 --> 03:42:50.319 align:start position:0%
they see and then somebody
 
03:42:53.110 --> 03:42:53.120 align:start position:0%
investigates but I mean you could argue
 
03:42:55.309 --> 03:42:55.319 align:start position:0%
right now that our cruelty statute might
 
03:42:57.510 --> 03:42:57.520 align:start position:0%
cover this already it would be a very
 
03:42:59.309 --> 03:42:59.319 align:start position:0%
broad uh
 
03:43:02.229 --> 03:43:02.239 align:start position:0%
interpretation um but it's not
 
03:43:04.469 --> 03:43:04.479 align:start position:0%
enforcable and like really enforceable
 
03:43:08.189 --> 03:43:08.199 align:start position:0%
to prosecutors unless we specify it so
 
03:43:10.389 --> 03:43:10.399 align:start position:0%
will there be issues with people saying
 
03:43:12.030 --> 03:43:12.040 align:start position:0%
you know well I think the this person
 
03:43:14.870 --> 03:43:14.880 align:start position:0%
may have done this yeah that could be an
 
03:43:17.269 --> 03:43:17.279 align:start position:0%
issue for investigation you have to go
 
03:43:19.149 --> 03:43:19.159 align:start position:0%
and look into things or what have you it
 
03:43:23.110 --> 03:43:23.120 align:start position:0%
might be a not as cleancut as we would
 
03:43:26.710 --> 03:43:26.720 align:start position:0%
like but it's better than not having it
 
03:43:28.790 --> 03:43:28.800 align:start position:0%
a crime at all in which case nothing
 
03:43:28.800 --> 03:43:31.189 align:start position:0%
a crime at all in which case nothing
gets

03:43:31.189 --> 03:43:31.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:35.309 --> 03:43:35.319 align:start position:0%
prosecuted any other questions in the
 
03:43:39.110 --> 03:43:39.120 align:start position:0%
committee so um I do have a question in
 
03:43:43.510 --> 03:43:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:47.429 --> 03:43:47.439 align:start position:0%
um do do you you consider
 
03:43:49.870 --> 03:43:49.880 align:start position:0%
bra a birth
 
03:43:53.550 --> 03:43:53.560 align:start position:0%
deformity regy seil is a by definition
 
03:43:55.590 --> 03:43:55.600 align:start position:0%
is a shortened snout in comparison to
 
03:43:57.349 --> 03:43:57.359 align:start position:0%
the length of the skull but is that a
 
03:43:59.590 --> 03:43:59.600 align:start position:0%
birth so that is a birth
 
03:44:02.110 --> 03:44:02.120 align:start position:0%
deformity you consider that a birth it's
 
03:44:04.149 --> 03:44:04.159 align:start position:0%
not my consideration it it is a birth
 
03:44:06.670 --> 03:44:06.680 align:start position:0%
deformity it is they are genetically
 
03:44:09.550 --> 03:44:09.560 align:start position:0%
bred to have shortened snouts in their
 
03:44:12.429 --> 03:44:12.439 align:start position:0%
and really shorten skeletons
 
03:44:16.510 --> 03:44:16.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:19.750 --> 03:44:19.760 align:start position:0%
um all right that's so that's all I have
 
03:44:21.990 --> 03:44:22.000 align:start position:0%
a question anybody
 
03:44:24.550 --> 03:44:24.560 align:start position:0%
else okay seeing none thank you for
 
03:44:27.070 --> 03:44:27.080 align:start position:0%

03:44:40.110 --> 03:44:40.120 align:start position:0%
bill that I need to go uh attend to to
 
03:44:42.269 --> 03:44:42.279 align:start position:0%
in another committee so I'm going to
 
03:44:44.429 --> 03:44:44.439 align:start position:0%
step out for a few moments and I hand
 
03:44:47.550 --> 03:44:47.560 align:start position:0%
over uh chairmanship to our uh
 
03:44:50.630 --> 03:44:50.640 align:start position:0%
representative kraton but I will call up
 
03:45:03.910 --> 03:45:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:06.750 --> 03:45:06.760 align:start position:0%
speaker well good afternoon and uh it's
 
03:45:08.950 --> 03:45:08.960 align:start position:0%
great to be back in Ena haven't been
 
03:45:11.950 --> 03:45:11.960 align:start position:0%
here for almost two years and you guys
 
03:45:14.389 --> 03:45:14.399 align:start position:0%
are doing a great job so for the record
 
03:45:16.389 --> 03:45:16.399 align:start position:0%
my name is Senator Howard Pearl I uh
 
03:45:18.710 --> 03:45:18.720 align:start position:0%
represent District 17 I live in the
 
03:45:21.830 --> 03:45:21.840 align:start position:0%
Great town of Lowden I am here to oppose
 
03:45:23.269 --> 03:45:23.279 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
03:45:25.590 --> 03:45:25.600 align:start position:0%
1102 and my main reasons for opposing
 
03:45:27.830 --> 03:45:27.840 align:start position:0%
this is you know I was a former owner of
 
03:45:30.269 --> 03:45:30.279 align:start position:0%
a boxer I love the dog he was a great
 
03:45:32.590 --> 03:45:32.600 align:start position:0%
dog and I and I know that boxers have
 
03:45:34.429 --> 03:45:34.439 align:start position:0%
this head shape and and it would prevent
 
03:45:36.910 --> 03:45:36.920 align:start position:0%
folks like myself from having a dog like
 
03:45:39.309 --> 03:45:39.319 align:start position:0%
that and uh he was a great dog had no
 
03:45:41.389 --> 03:45:41.399 align:start position:0%
breathing issues uh you just had no
 
03:45:41.399 --> 03:45:42.590 align:start position:0%
breathing issues uh you just had no
health

03:45:42.590 --> 03:45:42.600 align:start position:0%
health
 
03:45:44.510 --> 03:45:44.520 align:start position:0%
issues this bill threatens anyone
 
03:45:46.269 --> 03:45:46.279 align:start position:0%
breeding boxers with the risk of
 
03:45:48.510 --> 03:45:48.520 align:start position:0%
committing a crime and it would result
 
03:45:50.950 --> 03:45:50.960 align:start position:0%
in no New Hampshire residents breeding
 
03:45:53.349 --> 03:45:53.359 align:start position:0%
boxers or other breeds with this head
 
03:45:55.630 --> 03:45:55.640 align:start position:0%
shape that's a
 
03:45:57.790 --> 03:45:57.800 align:start position:0%
problem that that New Hampshire's always
 
03:45:59.750 --> 03:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
been a very friendly state to breeders
 
03:46:02.750 --> 03:46:02.760 align:start position:0%
and to animal agriculture when we start
 
03:46:05.309 --> 03:46:05.319 align:start position:0%
putting in things in place like this we
 
03:46:06.590 --> 03:46:06.600 align:start position:0%
we're really threatening that and that
 
03:46:08.590 --> 03:46:08.600 align:start position:0%
is very much a part of our
 
03:46:11.229 --> 03:46:11.239 align:start position:0%
heritage I guess notably this bill does
 
03:46:13.950 --> 03:46:13.960 align:start position:0%
not ban buying a boxer or any other dog
 
03:46:16.389 --> 03:46:16.399 align:start position:0%
with a short and wide skull so if I
 
03:46:17.990 --> 03:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
wanted to have another Boxer if this
 
03:46:19.389 --> 03:46:19.399 align:start position:0%
bill were to pass the only way I could
 
03:46:21.870 --> 03:46:21.880 align:start position:0%
do it would be to travel out of state
 
03:46:23.670 --> 03:46:23.680 align:start position:0%
and get one you know and wouldn't be
 
03:46:24.830 --> 03:46:24.840 align:start position:0%
able to get one from a local New
 
03:46:27.550 --> 03:46:27.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire breeder and over the many
 
03:46:30.349 --> 03:46:30.359 align:start position:0%
years that I sat on this committee with
 
03:46:32.269 --> 03:46:32.279 align:start position:0%
with many of you we've we've always
 
03:46:34.309 --> 03:46:34.319 align:start position:0%
known and heard about the the great
 
03:46:36.070 --> 03:46:36.080 align:start position:0%
relationships that our New Hampshire
 
03:46:38.189 --> 03:46:38.199 align:start position:0%
breeders have with their customers and I
 
03:46:39.710 --> 03:46:39.720 align:start position:0%
think this bill would put that in
 
03:46:42.149 --> 03:46:42.159 align:start position:0%
property I that would be very
 
03:46:43.950 --> 03:46:43.960 align:start position:0%
concerning you know when you when you're
 
03:46:45.389 --> 03:46:45.399 align:start position:0%
selecting your dog's breeder you want to
 
03:46:46.910 --> 03:46:46.920 align:start position:0%
be able to meet that local breeder you
 
03:46:48.630 --> 03:46:48.640 align:start position:0%
want to be able to meet the puppy sire
 
03:46:50.149 --> 03:46:50.159 align:start position:0%
that and and you want to be able to meet
 
03:46:51.349 --> 03:46:51.359 align:start position:0%
the dam and you want to know who they
 
03:46:53.149 --> 03:46:53.159 align:start position:0%
are and what you're buying and the
 
03:46:55.229 --> 03:46:55.239 align:start position:0%
having the ability to see that is what
 
03:46:57.229 --> 03:46:57.239 align:start position:0%
one of the distinct things that makes
 
03:46:59.229 --> 03:46:59.239 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire great that we can have
 
03:47:02.630 --> 03:47:02.640 align:start position:0%
those opportunities for our our buyers
 
03:47:05.229 --> 03:47:05.239 align:start position:0%
of dogs to come and see the Breeders and
 
03:47:07.429 --> 03:47:07.439 align:start position:0%
really get to meet them it that that's
 
03:47:08.990 --> 03:47:09.000 align:start position:0%
something we want to be real careful to
 
03:47:09.000 --> 03:47:14.670 align:start position:0%
something we want to be real careful to
protect

03:47:14.670 --> 03:47:14.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:16.469 --> 03:47:16.479 align:start position:0%
so when you uh you know local
 
03:47:18.030 --> 03:47:18.040 align:start position:0%
communities should consider breeders an
 
03:47:20.110 --> 03:47:20.120 align:start position:0%
asset they they're always great members
 
03:47:21.670 --> 03:47:21.680 align:start position:0%
of our community many of them have been
 
03:47:23.630 --> 03:47:23.640 align:start position:0%
here for for
 
03:47:25.830 --> 03:47:25.840 align:start position:0%
Generations you know they're in the
 
03:47:28.349 --> 03:47:28.359 align:start position:0%
unique position to Mentor new dog owners
 
03:47:30.269 --> 03:47:30.279 align:start position:0%
and provide advice and detailed
 
03:47:31.990 --> 03:47:32.000 align:start position:0%
information about the dogs they own and
 
03:47:34.790 --> 03:47:34.800 align:start position:0%
sell and and that's very critical we we
 
03:47:36.870 --> 03:47:36.880 align:start position:0%
see a lot of bills you know I did in the
 
03:47:39.229 --> 03:47:39.239 align:start position:0%
house I I have in the Senate we see many
 
03:47:41.510 --> 03:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
of them them and we're always looking to
 
03:47:42.910 --> 03:47:42.920 align:start position:0%
try and make sure that our animals are
 
03:47:44.590 --> 03:47:44.600 align:start position:0%
well taken care of and you know one of
 
03:47:46.070 --> 03:47:46.080 align:start position:0%
the things I always remind everybody
 
03:47:47.309 --> 03:47:47.319 align:start position:0%
there's nobody in this room that's
 
03:47:50.469 --> 03:47:50.479 align:start position:0%
advocating for animal cruelty never
 
03:47:52.469 --> 03:47:52.479 align:start position:0%
there never is what we're advocating is
 
03:47:54.389 --> 03:47:54.399 align:start position:0%
for good responsible animal ownership
 
03:47:56.309 --> 03:47:56.319 align:start position:0%
and the ability for owners to make
 
03:47:58.110 --> 03:47:58.120 align:start position:0%
decisions for themselves and and this
 
03:48:00.309 --> 03:48:00.319 align:start position:0%
bill challenges that and that that's one
 
03:48:02.590 --> 03:48:02.600 align:start position:0%
of the problems that I have with it so I
 
03:48:04.110 --> 03:48:04.120 align:start position:0%
think it would this bill would
 
03:48:06.229 --> 03:48:06.239 align:start position:0%
unacceptably eliminate an option for a
 
03:48:08.149 --> 03:48:08.159 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire residents to to see the
 
03:48:10.389 --> 03:48:10.399 align:start position:0%
dogs and to buy the ones that they want
 
03:48:12.590 --> 03:48:12.600 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to stop there because I'm
 
03:48:16.309 --> 03:48:16.319 align:start position:0%
supposed to be in finance 45 minutes ago
 
03:48:19.389 --> 03:48:19.399 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to run quickly and uh and
 
03:48:20.750 --> 03:48:20.760 align:start position:0%
if it's all right with the committee I'm
 
03:48:22.070 --> 03:48:22.080 align:start position:0%
really not going to take any questions
 
03:48:23.790 --> 03:48:23.800 align:start position:0%
because I'm much later than I should be
 
03:48:25.309 --> 03:48:25.319 align:start position:0%
but I appreciate the opportunity and I
 
03:48:26.590 --> 03:48:26.600 align:start position:0%
appreciate you all being here this is
 
03:48:28.309 --> 03:48:28.319 align:start position:0%
one of the issues that and all of these
 
03:48:31.070 --> 03:48:31.080 align:start position:0%
animal cruelty issues are that you know
 
03:48:32.670 --> 03:48:32.680 align:start position:0%
whenever we're considering legislation
 
03:48:35.550 --> 03:48:35.560 align:start position:0%
it's a challenge and it and I just want
 
03:48:36.910 --> 03:48:36.920 align:start position:0%
you to know that you know you're doing a
 
03:48:38.429 --> 03:48:38.439 align:start position:0%
great job and we thank you for being
 
03:48:40.030 --> 03:48:40.040 align:start position:0%
here and and I I hope you'll look at
 
03:48:41.670 --> 03:48:41.680 align:start position:0%
this bill and realize that this really
 
03:48:43.349 --> 03:48:43.359 align:start position:0%
is not right for New Hampshire it's not
 
03:48:45.189 --> 03:48:45.199 align:start position:0%
what we want to set so thank you for
 
03:48:46.590 --> 03:48:46.600 align:start position:0%
that Senator thank you for your
 
03:48:49.790 --> 03:48:49.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:51.910 --> 03:48:51.920 align:start position:0%
welcome next I'd like to call The
 
03:48:59.149 --> 03:48:59.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:01.149 --> 03:49:01.159 align:start position:0%
marula and if everyone can remember
 
03:49:07.269 --> 03:49:07.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:10.910 --> 03:49:10.920 align:start position:0%
minutes took me a minute to walk here
 
03:49:14.710 --> 03:49:14.720 align:start position:0%
so uh thank you uh for giving me an
 
03:49:17.710 --> 03:49:17.720 align:start position:0%
opportunity today to speak to you uh and
 
03:49:19.550 --> 03:49:19.560 align:start position:0%
as Howard said it's great to have all
 
03:49:21.750 --> 03:49:21.760 align:start position:0%
the representatives here uh and
 
03:49:23.990 --> 03:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
listening to this bill I have several
 
03:49:27.349 --> 03:49:27.359 align:start position:0%
issues with it um I I think the biggest
 
03:49:29.510 --> 03:49:29.520 align:start position:0%
thing that people need to understand is
 
03:49:32.910 --> 03:49:32.920 align:start position:0%
if you're going to purchase an animal a
 
03:49:35.790 --> 03:49:35.800 align:start position:0%
dog for3 to
 
03:49:37.630 --> 03:49:37.640 align:start position:0%
$6,000 uh I think you're going to do
 
03:49:40.950 --> 03:49:40.960 align:start position:0%
your research and I can't imagine even
 
03:49:43.389 --> 03:49:43.399 align:start position:0%
buying a dog for $600 without doing some
 
03:49:48.269 --> 03:49:48.279 align:start position:0%
research on it so to assume that um to
 
03:49:51.149 --> 03:49:51.159 align:start position:0%
make the assumption that people aren't
 
03:49:53.030 --> 03:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
doing that is kind of strange to me the
 
03:49:56.229 --> 03:49:56.239 align:start position:0%
Breeders as uh Senator Pearl said are
 
03:50:00.710 --> 03:50:00.720 align:start position:0%
very important um I think that
 
03:50:04.309 --> 03:50:04.319 align:start position:0%
uh we need to look at breeders the
 
03:50:07.070 --> 03:50:07.080 align:start position:0%
they're ethical they're ethical breeders
 
03:50:10.429 --> 03:50:10.439 align:start position:0%
and to continue to talk about
 
03:50:13.830 --> 03:50:13.840 align:start position:0%
um information that is on the web or you
 
03:50:16.110 --> 03:50:16.120 align:start position:0%
got from a veterinarian that's fine but
 
03:50:17.950 --> 03:50:17.960 align:start position:0%
in the long run we all have to make that
 
03:50:20.389 --> 03:50:20.399 align:start position:0%
decision it's was my choice to have a
 
03:50:22.670 --> 03:50:22.680 align:start position:0%
bulldog I knew what I was getting into
 
03:50:25.670 --> 03:50:25.680 align:start position:0%
when I purchased it uh it was my choice
 
03:50:26.990 --> 03:50:27.000 align:start position:0%
and I have a
 
03:50:30.870 --> 03:50:30.880 align:start position:0%
Frenchie uh she is cute um she doesn't
 
03:50:33.710 --> 03:50:33.720 align:start position:0%
sleep the way was explained um she
 
03:50:35.870 --> 03:50:35.880 align:start position:0%
sleeps a little differently but that's
 
03:50:37.309 --> 03:50:37.319 align:start position:0%
not the issue I think what we're here
 
03:50:39.750 --> 03:50:39.760 align:start position:0%
today to find out is how how do we move
 
03:50:42.510 --> 03:50:42.520 align:start position:0%
forward with something like this uh and
 
03:50:45.149 --> 03:50:45.159 align:start position:0%
as Senator pointed out um none of us in
 
03:50:47.550 --> 03:50:47.560 align:start position:0%
this room on either side would be
 
03:50:50.790 --> 03:50:50.800 align:start position:0%
comfortable hurting an animal so I think
 
03:50:52.630 --> 03:50:52.640 align:start position:0%
we need to keep that in
 
03:50:55.550 --> 03:50:55.560 align:start position:0%
Focus um I believe there's already a law
 
03:50:57.309 --> 03:50:57.319 align:start position:0%
in the state now I served quite a while
 
03:50:58.910 --> 03:50:58.920 align:start position:0%
ago so I'm not sure if it's still around
 
03:51:01.189 --> 03:51:01.199 align:start position:0%
but there was a law in the state that a
 
03:51:05.429 --> 03:51:05.439 align:start position:0%
breeder could not sell uh to another
 
03:51:07.429 --> 03:51:07.439 align:start position:0%
breeder or not breed to another dog
 
03:51:09.710 --> 03:51:09.720 align:start position:0%
rather um if there was a problem with
 
03:51:12.910 --> 03:51:12.920 align:start position:0%
the dog and they could not sell that
 
03:51:16.030 --> 03:51:16.040 align:start position:0%
particular animal to anyone and they
 
03:51:17.870 --> 03:51:17.880 align:start position:0%
needed to tell people that so I believe
 
03:51:19.830 --> 03:51:19.840 align:start position:0%
there is a law in place uh I would have
 
03:51:23.149 --> 03:51:23.159 align:start position:0%
to check on that but I could be wrong so
 
03:51:24.670 --> 03:51:24.680 align:start position:0%
I think that's something to keep in mind
 
03:51:26.710 --> 03:51:26.720 align:start position:0%
that we can't we already have a law in
 
03:51:31.349 --> 03:51:31.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:34.070 --> 03:51:34.080 align:start position:0%
that I had so much to talk about but I
 
03:51:37.510 --> 03:51:37.520 align:start position:0%
think everything has come out already um
 
03:51:39.910 --> 03:51:39.920 align:start position:0%
I also think that uh we have have very
 
03:51:42.990 --> 03:51:43.000 align:start position:0%
capable veterinarians in this state and
 
03:51:44.510 --> 03:51:44.520 align:start position:0%
we don't need to be listening to
 
03:51:46.550 --> 03:51:46.560 align:start position:0%
somebody from out of state or out of the
 
03:51:50.389 --> 03:51:50.399 align:start position:0%
country um was mentioned a few times uh
 
03:51:52.870 --> 03:51:52.880 align:start position:0%
that studies were done in the UK and in
 
03:51:55.950 --> 03:51:55.960 align:start position:0%
Norway um you know I think that our
 
03:51:58.590 --> 03:51:58.600 align:start position:0%
forefathers fought to keep those laws
 
03:52:01.030 --> 03:52:01.040 align:start position:0%
out of our country and I don't think we
 
03:52:03.550 --> 03:52:03.560 align:start position:0%
need it today we don't need a law that's
 
03:52:06.630 --> 03:52:06.640 align:start position:0%
brought to us from someplace else or
 
03:52:08.469 --> 03:52:08.479 align:start position:0%
feel that that's a place that we should
 
03:52:09.790 --> 03:52:09.800 align:start position:0%
look to for
 
03:52:11.950 --> 03:52:11.960 align:start position:0%
uh information we have very capable
 
03:52:13.389 --> 03:52:13.399 align:start position:0%
people in this country that can give
 
03:52:16.590 --> 03:52:16.600 align:start position:0%
that information to us
 
03:52:20.189 --> 03:52:20.199 align:start position:0%
um I also think that I think you've hit
 
03:52:23.229 --> 03:52:23.239 align:start position:0%
your three minutes three minutes okay
 
03:52:26.550 --> 03:52:26.560 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll wrap it up so uh thank you so
 
03:52:28.349 --> 03:52:28.359 align:start position:0%
much for giving me this opportunity I
 
03:52:30.229 --> 03:52:30.239 align:start position:0%
would be glad to talk to anyone after
 
03:52:32.990 --> 03:52:33.000 align:start position:0%
about why we purchase the dogs we have
 
03:52:36.189 --> 03:52:36.199 align:start position:0%
and that they're very healthy uh as um
 
03:52:38.309 --> 03:52:38.319 align:start position:0%
representative Reed said we would come
 
03:52:39.750 --> 03:52:39.760 align:start position:0%
up and tell you how happy we are with
 
03:52:41.550 --> 03:52:41.560 align:start position:0%
her dog and she's she's right in that
 
03:52:43.309 --> 03:52:43.319 align:start position:0%
fact so thank you so much for having me
 
03:52:43.319 --> 03:52:44.870 align:start position:0%
fact so thank you so much for having me
today

03:52:44.870 --> 03:52:44.880 align:start position:0%
today
 
03:52:50.510 --> 03:52:50.520 align:start position:0%
okay thank you um honorable past
 
03:52:54.189 --> 03:52:54.199 align:start position:0%
representative uh marzulo we I I do want
 
03:52:59.269 --> 03:52:59.279 align:start position:0%
to uh point out RSA 437 colon 5
 
03:53:01.149 --> 03:53:01.159 align:start position:0%
regarding the transfer of animal and
 
03:53:05.070 --> 03:53:05.080 align:start position:0%
animals and birds does say uh no leny
 
03:53:07.149 --> 03:53:07.159 align:start position:0%
under the subdivision shall transfer
 
03:53:09.030 --> 03:53:09.040 align:start position:0%
other than to a qualified veterinarian
 
03:53:11.149 --> 03:53:11.159 align:start position:0%
or licensed animal shelter facility May
 
03:53:13.870 --> 03:53:13.880 align:start position:0%
any maimed sick or diseased animal or
 
03:53:16.550 --> 03:53:16.560 align:start position:0%
bird other than is permitted under RSA
 
03:53:20.229 --> 03:53:20.239 align:start position:0%
437 colon 8 nor shall any lcy treat
 
03:53:22.189 --> 03:53:22.199 align:start position:0%
inhumanely any animal or bird in his or
 
03:53:24.830 --> 03:53:24.840 align:start position:0%
her care position possession or under
 
03:53:26.950 --> 03:53:26.960 align:start position:0%
his or her control so I don't know if
 
03:53:29.670 --> 03:53:29.680 align:start position:0%
that was the RSA that you were referring
 
03:53:33.469 --> 03:53:33.479 align:start position:0%
to um but I do know that any animal that
 
03:53:37.950 --> 03:53:37.960 align:start position:0%
is transferred does need a um health
 
03:53:41.429 --> 03:53:41.439 align:start position:0%
certificate so presumably the
 
03:53:44.189 --> 03:53:44.199 align:start position:0%
animal does have to be healthy when it's
 
03:53:47.189 --> 03:53:47.199 align:start position:0%
sold um that being said we all recognize
 
03:53:48.830 --> 03:53:48.840 align:start position:0%
that a health certificate sort of is a
 
03:53:52.229 --> 03:53:52.239 align:start position:0%
snapshot in time um you cannot predict
 
03:53:54.550 --> 03:53:54.560 align:start position:0%
what kind of conditions an animal is
 
03:53:55.590 --> 03:53:55.600 align:start position:0%
going to
 
03:53:59.269 --> 03:53:59.279 align:start position:0%
develop um be they you know caused by
 
03:54:02.349 --> 03:54:02.359 align:start position:0%
congenital issues or or genetics or
 
03:54:06.590 --> 03:54:06.600 align:start position:0%
anything else but um my question to you
 
03:54:06.600 --> 03:54:07.630 align:start position:0%
anything else but um my question to you
is

03:54:07.630 --> 03:54:07.640 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:54:12.790 --> 03:54:12.800 align:start position:0%
um as so you have a French Bulldog now
 
03:54:17.389 --> 03:54:17.399 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah and and has it had uh horrible
 
03:54:19.630 --> 03:54:19.640 align:start position:0%
health issues as a result of its uh
 
03:54:23.510 --> 03:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
breed no none at all um it's we've been
 
03:54:25.590 --> 03:54:25.600 align:start position:0%
we were very careful at the breeder we
 
03:54:28.349 --> 03:54:28.359 align:start position:0%
chose uh turned out that the breeder was
 
03:54:30.389 --> 03:54:30.399 align:start position:0%
about four miles from my house which I
 
03:54:32.990 --> 03:54:33.000 align:start position:0%
didn't even know about uh and we we
 
03:54:35.590 --> 03:54:35.600 align:start position:0%
spent some time with him uh then we took
 
03:54:37.870 --> 03:54:37.880 align:start position:0%
her took him took her to our
 
03:54:40.750 --> 03:54:40.760 align:start position:0%
veterinarian and uh she checked her she
 
03:54:42.630 --> 03:54:42.640 align:start position:0%
checked cozette is the dog's name she
 
03:54:45.349 --> 03:54:45.359 align:start position:0%
checked cozette out and uh there was no
 
03:54:49.510 --> 03:54:49.520 align:start position:0%
problems at all um the face is more open
 
03:54:51.469 --> 03:54:51.479 align:start position:0%
so we believe it was bred the way we
 
03:54:53.429 --> 03:54:53.439 align:start position:0%
would consider breeding dogs we bred
 
03:54:55.590 --> 03:54:55.600 align:start position:0%
Chows a long time ago I'm not a breeder
 
03:54:58.429 --> 03:54:58.439 align:start position:0%
today certainly but we were familiar
 
03:55:01.229 --> 03:55:01.239 align:start position:0%
with those types of issues so no there's
 
03:55:03.750 --> 03:55:03.760 align:start position:0%
been no problems at all with this dog
 
03:55:05.670 --> 03:55:05.680 align:start position:0%
any other
 
03:55:08.110 --> 03:55:08.120 align:start position:0%
questions see none thank you very much
 
03:55:11.269 --> 03:55:11.279 align:start position:0%
for you coming today to testify thank
 
03:55:33.149 --> 03:55:33.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:36.229 --> 03:55:36.239 align:start position:0%
Chase good afternoon good afternoon
 
03:55:37.790 --> 03:55:37.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for having
 
03:55:42.429 --> 03:55:42.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:45.910 --> 03:55:45.920 align:start position:0%
on I did want to speak to um as far as
 
03:55:48.110 --> 03:55:48.120 align:start position:0%
people choosing and and buying from
 
03:55:50.110 --> 03:55:50.120 align:start position:0%
readers people get them because they're
 
03:55:52.550 --> 03:55:52.560 align:start position:0%
cute they don't always do their research
 
03:55:56.149 --> 03:55:56.159 align:start position:0%
anyways my my just is just my personal
 
03:55:58.710 --> 03:55:58.720 align:start position:0%
experience um I've always loved Bulldogs
 
03:56:00.229 --> 03:56:00.239 align:start position:0%
since the first one I've met with my
 
03:56:02.790 --> 03:56:02.800 align:start position:0%
customers I've wanted one for years
 
03:56:05.149 --> 03:56:05.159 align:start position:0%
couldn't afford it as I got older I
 
03:56:07.149 --> 03:56:07.159 align:start position:0%
could so I started doing my
 
03:56:09.910 --> 03:56:09.920 align:start position:0%
research big difference from the old
 
03:56:13.309 --> 03:56:13.319 align:start position:0%
English bulldog Britain English Bulldog
 
03:56:15.990 --> 03:56:16.000 align:start position:0%
how they're breed here night and day
 
03:56:17.790 --> 03:56:17.800 align:start position:0%
they're healthier in Britain they're
 
03:56:22.269 --> 03:56:22.279 align:start position:0%
longer legs bigger snout here they have
 
03:56:23.990 --> 03:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
trying to make the bum as Tiny as
 
03:56:27.269 --> 03:56:27.279 align:start position:0%
possible the head as big as possible
 
03:56:28.870 --> 03:56:28.880 align:start position:0%
they have to have not all of them some
 
03:56:30.750 --> 03:56:30.760 align:start position:0%
of them have to have C-sections and if
 
03:56:33.469 --> 03:56:33.479 align:start position:0%
they're a breeder that's constant scar
 
03:56:37.870 --> 03:56:37.880 align:start position:0%
tissue and again not good for any animal
 
03:56:42.950 --> 03:56:42.960 align:start position:0%
um the wrinkles the flat face um the the
 
03:56:47.630 --> 03:56:47.640 align:start position:0%
soft pallet I belong to a bunch of um
 
03:56:51.389 --> 03:56:51.399 align:start position:0%
bully breed rescues the stories are
 
03:56:54.950 --> 03:56:54.960 align:start position:0%
horrific I'm not saying that all Bully
 
03:56:57.830 --> 03:56:57.840 align:start position:0%
breeds have problems but the ones that
 
03:57:00.670 --> 03:57:00.680 align:start position:0%
do are horrible people give up their
 
03:57:02.510 --> 03:57:02.520 align:start position:0%
dogs they drop them off at a shelter
 
03:57:05.550 --> 03:57:05.560 align:start position:0%
because they cannot afford the surgeries
 
03:57:09.030 --> 03:57:09.040 align:start position:0%
to make them healthy um for instance
 
03:57:12.550 --> 03:57:12.560 align:start position:0%
Long Island Long Island um bulldog
 
03:57:15.229 --> 03:57:15.239 align:start position:0%
rescue you could look on their site and
 
03:57:19.349 --> 03:57:19.359 align:start position:0%
see the horror stories they go on um the
 
03:57:21.710 --> 03:57:21.720 align:start position:0%
the kind of running joke not joke if
 
03:57:23.910 --> 03:57:23.920 align:start position:0%
you're going to get a bulldog you better
 
03:57:26.750 --> 03:57:26.760 align:start position:0%
have $20,000 extra in the bank for
 
03:57:30.229 --> 03:57:30.239 align:start position:0%
surgeries or really good insurance um I
 
03:57:32.590 --> 03:57:32.600 align:start position:0%
am fortunate that my girl
 
03:57:36.389 --> 03:57:36.399 align:start position:0%
has my girl has um she's healthy and she
 
03:57:38.710 --> 03:57:38.720 align:start position:0%
can breathe and I would love to see see
 
03:57:42.149 --> 03:57:42.159 align:start position:0%

committee for hearing my testimony I'm
 
03:58:09.510 --> 03:58:09.520 align:start position:0%
I'm in front of you to ask you all to U
 
03:58:11.630 --> 03:58:11.640 align:start position:0%
vote on in expedient to legislate on
 
03:58:13.590 --> 03:58:13.600 align:start position:0%
this particular bill and I'll tell you
 
03:58:18.229 --> 03:58:18.239 align:start position:0%
why um for 15 years I had a Shih Tzu and
 
03:58:20.349 --> 03:58:20.359 align:start position:0%
the Shih Tzu was given to me I did not
 
03:58:24.070 --> 03:58:24.080 align:start position:0%
purchase the dog from a breeder um but
 
03:58:27.189 --> 03:58:27.199 align:start position:0%
before I even had the dog in my home I
 
03:58:29.349 --> 03:58:29.359 align:start position:0%
did my research and found out that the
 
03:58:32.830 --> 03:58:32.840 align:start position:0%
dog is in fact one of the brachos phalic
 
03:58:39.269 --> 03:58:39.279 align:start position:0%
breeds um unfortunately um max um did
 
03:58:42.110 --> 03:58:42.120 align:start position:0%
expire at 13 years old but not due to
 
03:58:44.750 --> 03:58:44.760 align:start position:0%
anything attributed to being a
 
03:58:46.870 --> 03:58:46.880 align:start position:0%
brachiocephalic dog he had conest of
 
03:58:51.469 --> 03:58:51.479 align:start position:0%
heart failure at 13 years old um and it
 
03:58:54.710 --> 03:58:54.720 align:start position:0%
was a blow to my family my family who
 
03:58:56.830 --> 03:58:56.840 align:start position:0%
absolutely embraced this dog but also
 
03:58:58.630 --> 03:58:58.640 align:start position:0%
knew of any of the health issues that
 
03:59:00.870 --> 03:59:00.880 align:start position:0%
may come up and I wanted to give you a
 
03:59:03.149 --> 03:59:03.159 align:start position:0%
brief history of what a shatu is and
 
03:59:05.309 --> 03:59:05.319 align:start position:0%
that is the proper Chinese uh
 
03:59:08.830 --> 03:59:08.840 align:start position:0%
pronunciation yitsu is in Chinese the
 
03:59:10.389 --> 03:59:10.399 align:start position:0%
lion dog and they were breed
 
03:59:12.710 --> 03:59:12.720 align:start position:0%
specifically in Tibet and Mongolia for
 
03:59:15.550 --> 03:59:15.560 align:start position:0%
the Imperial family um they were
 
03:59:17.670 --> 03:59:17.680 align:start position:0%
considered to be very spiritual dogs
 
03:59:20.229 --> 03:59:20.239 align:start position:0%
according to the Buddhists and um the
 
03:59:22.110 --> 03:59:22.120 align:start position:0%
emperor and the Imperial family kept
 
03:59:24.590 --> 03:59:24.600 align:start position:0%
them because they represented The Souls
 
03:59:26.550 --> 03:59:26.560 align:start position:0%
of any of the Fallen Buddhist monks
 
03:59:28.910 --> 03:59:28.920 align:start position:0%
which I thought was very interesting in
 
03:59:31.349 --> 03:59:31.359 align:start position:0%
1948 during the cultural revolution in
 
03:59:35.429 --> 03:59:35.439 align:start position:0%
China uh Ma's regime killed every Shih
 
03:59:38.510 --> 03:59:38.520 align:start position:0%
Tzu except for 13 and they were smuggled
 
03:59:40.710 --> 03:59:40.720 align:start position:0%
into England and Norway to be bred and
 
03:59:43.590 --> 03:59:43.600 align:start position:0%
then subsequently brought to the British
 
03:59:46.030 --> 03:59:46.040 align:start position:0%
Isles and the United States that's
 
03:59:46.040 --> 03:59:46.950 align:start position:0%
Isles and the United States that's
animal

03:59:46.950 --> 03:59:46.960 align:start position:0%
animal
 
03:59:50.229 --> 03:59:50.239 align:start position:0%
cruelty having a brachiocephalic dog
 
03:59:53.070 --> 03:59:53.080 align:start position:0%
does not equate animal cruelty what it
 
03:59:55.790 --> 03:59:55.800 align:start position:0%
means is that dog is break your calic
 
03:59:57.389 --> 03:59:57.399 align:start position:0%
and there are certain steps that you
 
04:00:00.229 --> 04:00:00.239 align:start position:0%
take in order to keep that dog healthy
 
04:00:02.590 --> 04:00:02.600 align:start position:0%
you clean their eyes you make sure their
 
04:00:04.309 --> 04:00:04.319 align:start position:0%
teeth are clean you take them to the vet
 
04:00:06.670 --> 04:00:06.680 align:start position:0%
regularly and I didn't need tens of
 
04:00:08.429 --> 04:00:08.439 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars to care for this
 
04:00:10.950 --> 04:00:10.960 align:start position:0%
dog just regular maintenance and making
 
04:00:13.870 --> 04:00:13.880 align:start position:0%
sure that he was well was not a stretch
 
04:00:16.510 --> 04:00:16.520 align:start position:0%
for a beloved family pet and I am
 
04:00:19.030 --> 04:00:19.040 align:start position:0%
currently on the lookout through every
 
04:00:22.750 --> 04:00:22.760 align:start position:0%
adoption um agency in the United States
 
04:00:25.630 --> 04:00:25.640 align:start position:0%

04:01:23.790 --> 04:01:23.800 align:start position:0%
afternoon I've been frantically revising
 
04:01:25.790 --> 04:01:25.800 align:start position:0%
my testimony because everything's being
 
04:01:27.830 --> 04:01:27.840 align:start position:0%
said so bear with me my name is Joan
 
04:01:30.110 --> 04:01:30.120 align:start position:0%
O'Brien and on behalf of the New
 
04:01:31.469 --> 04:01:31.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire animal rights league and our
 
04:01:34.149 --> 04:01:34.159 align:start position:0%
members we are here to respectfully
 
04:01:36.030 --> 04:01:36.040 align:start position:0%
request that the committee support House
 
04:01:39.229 --> 04:01:39.239 align:start position:0%
Bill 1102 to end the the selling or
 
04:01:40.950 --> 04:01:40.960 align:start position:0%
intentionally breeding of dogs with a
 
04:01:43.309 --> 04:01:43.319 align:start position:0%
deformity that causes
 
04:01:45.710 --> 04:01:45.720 align:start position:0%
suffering I'm going to focus on um
 
04:01:47.790 --> 04:01:47.800 align:start position:0%
Breaky spelic dogs since that seems to
 
04:01:50.030 --> 04:01:50.040 align:start position:0%
be the focus of the conversation around
 
04:01:50.040 --> 04:01:50.950 align:start position:0%
be the focus of the conversation around
this

04:01:50.950 --> 04:01:50.960 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:01:54.349 --> 04:01:54.359 align:start position:0%
bill it is highly distressing to know
 
04:01:57.710 --> 04:01:57.720 align:start position:0%
that right now millions of dogs millions
 
04:02:00.189 --> 04:02:00.199 align:start position:0%
of flat-faced dogs around the state and
 
04:02:03.670 --> 04:02:03.680 align:start position:0%
country are struggling just to breathe
 
04:02:06.030 --> 04:02:06.040 align:start position:0%
and more are being brought into the
 
04:02:09.790 --> 04:02:09.800 align:start position:0%
world every day
 
04:02:11.910 --> 04:02:11.920 align:start position:0%
as the bill sponsor explained extremely
 
04:02:15.189 --> 04:02:15.199 align:start position:0%
well uh these dogs have um have they
 
04:02:17.670 --> 04:02:17.680 align:start position:0%
they've been bred in a way that means
 
04:02:21.750 --> 04:02:21.760 align:start position:0%
their anatomical features can't function
 
04:02:24.070 --> 04:02:24.080 align:start position:0%
properly tinkering with
 
04:02:27.030 --> 04:02:27.040 align:start position:0%
nature to produce dogs that serve our
 
04:02:29.469 --> 04:02:29.479 align:start position:0%
needs whether it's for appearances or
 
04:02:34.670 --> 04:02:34.680 align:start position:0%
function has upended survival of the
 
04:02:37.710 --> 04:02:37.720 align:start position:0%
fitness the health of bralic dogs is so
 
04:02:39.910 --> 04:02:39.920 align:start position:0%
precarious that most commercial airlines
 
04:02:42.429 --> 04:02:42.439 align:start position:0%
won't even allow them to fly because so
 
04:02:45.189 --> 04:02:45.199 align:start position:0%
many have died in
 
04:02:47.830 --> 04:02:47.840 align:start position:0%
Flight while Veterinary intervention can
 
04:02:51.030 --> 04:02:51.040 align:start position:0%
alleviate suffering from some dogs many
 
04:02:53.349 --> 04:02:53.359 align:start position:0%
if not most will never be helped because
 
04:02:55.229 --> 04:02:55.239 align:start position:0%
their suffering goes unnoticed or
 
04:02:59.110 --> 04:02:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:01.830 --> 04:03:01.840 align:start position:0%
unaffordable given the exponential
 
04:03:04.670 --> 04:03:04.680 align:start position:0%
popularity of all these flat-faced dogs
 
04:03:07.110 --> 04:03:07.120 align:start position:0%
we have on our hands a canine welfare
 
04:03:07.120 --> 04:03:11.990 align:start position:0%
we have on our hands a canine welfare
crisis

04:03:11.990 --> 04:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:14.750 --> 04:03:14.760 align:start position:0%
the Cris it's a crisis that warrants
 
04:03:16.469 --> 04:03:16.479 align:start position:0%
legislative action to bring about as
 
04:03:18.389 --> 04:03:18.399 align:start position:0%
Swift as possible an end to this type of
 
04:03:21.670 --> 04:03:21.680 align:start position:0%
breeding as possible thank
 
04:03:25.389 --> 04:03:25.399 align:start position:0%
you to close um I think the breed
 
04:03:27.550 --> 04:03:27.560 align:start position:0%
Registries have kind of lost control of
 
04:03:27.560 --> 04:03:29.389 align:start position:0%
Registries have kind of lost control of
enforcing

04:03:29.389 --> 04:03:29.399 align:start position:0%
enforcing
 
04:03:32.349 --> 04:03:32.359 align:start position:0%
standards and the consumers are not
 
04:03:34.429 --> 04:03:34.439 align:start position:0%
educated many don't even care about
 
04:03:36.469 --> 04:03:36.479 align:start position:0%
registering their dogs visit one of New
 
04:03:38.229 --> 04:03:38.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's puppy stores on a Saturday
 
04:03:40.070 --> 04:03:40.080 align:start position:0%
and you will see for yourself so we
 
04:03:41.469 --> 04:03:41.479 align:start position:0%
hopefully will support this Bill thank
 
04:03:43.149 --> 04:03:43.159 align:start position:0%
you very
 
04:03:45.349 --> 04:03:45.359 align:start position:0%
much thank you any questions from the
 
04:03:48.149 --> 04:03:48.159 align:start position:0%
committee happy to take questions um I'm
 
04:03:51.429 --> 04:03:51.439 align:start position:0%
interested to know if you are um if you
 
04:03:54.070 --> 04:03:54.080 align:start position:0%
know what the breeding standards are for
 
04:03:55.750 --> 04:03:55.760 align:start position:0%
these particular
 
04:03:59.110 --> 04:03:59.120 align:start position:0%
breeds I did happen to carefully read
 
04:04:00.990 --> 04:04:01.000 align:start position:0%
the breed standards for a pug in
 
04:04:03.630 --> 04:04:03.640 align:start position:0%
preparing for this um
 
04:04:08.070 --> 04:04:08.080 align:start position:0%
hearing about a 50-page document okay um
 
04:04:10.110 --> 04:04:10.120 align:start position:0%
and did you find anything in the
 
04:04:13.229 --> 04:04:13.239 align:start position:0%
breeding standard that would indicate
 
04:04:16.110 --> 04:04:16.120 align:start position:0%
that if the dog was bred according to
 
04:04:19.030 --> 04:04:19.040 align:start position:0%
the standard that it would be unhealthy
 
04:04:22.750 --> 04:04:22.760 align:start position:0%
or sick or in a need of um
 
04:04:27.389 --> 04:04:27.399 align:start position:0%
surgeries uh yes I did um I can't quote
 
04:04:29.070 --> 04:04:29.080 align:start position:0%
it exactly but there
 
04:04:31.550 --> 04:04:31.560 align:start position:0%
are the some of the standards include a
 
04:04:34.750 --> 04:04:34.760 align:start position:0%
flattest face as possible uh that is by
 
04:04:40.469 --> 04:04:40.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:43.389 --> 04:04:43.399 align:start position:0%
so so the the standard actually says in
 
04:04:46.510 --> 04:04:46.520 align:start position:0%
it the flat flattest faces possible yes
 
04:04:46.520 --> 04:04:47.830 align:start position:0%
it the flat flattest faces possible yes
it

04:04:47.830 --> 04:04:47.840 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:04:51.110 --> 04:04:51.120 align:start position:0%
does okay and where did where did you
 
04:04:54.269 --> 04:04:54.279 align:start position:0%
see this uh was this the American Kennel
 
04:04:56.189 --> 04:04:56.199 align:start position:0%
Club has a link to the breed standards
 
04:05:01.110 --> 04:05:01.120 align:start position:0%
for all the the popular dogs okay
 
04:05:04.870 --> 04:05:04.880 align:start position:0%
um would you suggest that every
 
04:05:09.110 --> 04:05:09.120 align:start position:0%
brachio brachio phalic dog is
 
04:05:13.349 --> 04:05:13.359 align:start position:0%
unhealthy no certainly not okay so so
 
04:05:15.110 --> 04:05:15.120 align:start position:0%
within the breed or
 
04:05:19.229 --> 04:05:19.239 align:start position:0%
within I'm just trying to tease out that
 
04:05:22.189 --> 04:05:22.199 align:start position:0%
brachio falic does not necessarily
 
04:05:25.510 --> 04:05:25.520 align:start position:0%
equate to suffering that there is there
 
04:05:28.469 --> 04:05:28.479 align:start position:0%
are very many healthy Shih Tzus and
 
04:05:31.990 --> 04:05:32.000 align:start position:0%
Bulldogs and French Frenchies and Pines
 
04:05:34.469 --> 04:05:34.479 align:start position:0%
and they're very healthy and there's no
 
04:05:38.429 --> 04:05:38.439 align:start position:0%
problem so I I I'm I'm struggling with
 
04:05:38.439 --> 04:05:39.349 align:start position:0%
problem so I I I'm I'm struggling with
that

04:05:39.349 --> 04:05:39.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:05:42.229 --> 04:05:42.239 align:start position:0%
because you know it it says here in the
 
04:05:44.429 --> 04:05:44.439 align:start position:0%
bill sells an animal that has a birth
 
04:05:47.510 --> 04:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
deformity that causes suffering such as
 
04:05:51.229 --> 04:05:51.239 align:start position:0%
brachio and and and so it it seems to me
 
04:05:55.149 --> 04:05:55.159 align:start position:0%
that um just because an animal is
 
04:05:57.790 --> 04:05:57.800 align:start position:0%
brachio falic does not necessarily mean
 
04:06:01.070 --> 04:06:01.080 align:start position:0%
that it's suffering that's true it it's
 
04:06:03.750 --> 04:06:03.760 align:start position:0%
it by definition is deformity but not
 
04:06:06.030 --> 04:06:06.040 align:start position:0%
necessarily causing suffering so you
 
04:06:09.710 --> 04:06:09.720 align:start position:0%
might add to the end such as Brey saali
 
04:06:12.389 --> 04:06:12.399 align:start position:0%
that causes
 
04:06:14.469 --> 04:06:14.479 align:start position:0%
suffering okay thank you any other
 
04:06:16.990 --> 04:06:17.000 align:start position:0%
questions representive
 
04:06:19.830 --> 04:06:19.840 align:start position:0%
kraton yes Madam chair thank you and
 
04:06:23.510 --> 04:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony I just to
 
04:06:25.710 --> 04:06:25.720 align:start position:0%
amplify a little bit I think on what the
 
04:06:28.389 --> 04:06:28.399 align:start position:0%
the chair was saying that so as I read
 
04:06:31.070 --> 04:06:31.080 align:start position:0%
the bill it says two individual animals
 
04:06:33.950 --> 04:06:33.960 align:start position:0%
with the same deformity but that doesn't
 
04:06:37.070 --> 04:06:37.080 align:start position:0%
necessarily mean two Pugs that means two
 
04:06:38.429 --> 04:06:38.439 align:start position:0%
pugs with
 
04:06:41.349 --> 04:06:41.359 align:start position:0%
formity and so as you read this does
 
04:06:43.790 --> 04:06:43.800 align:start position:0%
that mean you cannot breed for example
 
04:06:45.990 --> 04:06:46.000 align:start position:0%
pugs this
 
04:06:48.229 --> 04:06:48.239 align:start position:0%
legislation well I wish that the sponsor
 
04:06:51.910 --> 04:06:51.920 align:start position:0%
were here to answer that question um I
 
04:06:54.910 --> 04:06:54.920 align:start position:0%
think you would not be allowed to breed
 
04:06:57.670 --> 04:06:57.680 align:start position:0%
two pugs who had a deformity causing
 
04:06:59.910 --> 04:06:59.920 align:start position:0%
suffering that is the intention of the
 
04:07:02.309 --> 04:07:02.319 align:start position:0%
legislation so that for a followup
 
04:07:04.469 --> 04:07:04.479 align:start position:0%
followup so did then you read that you
 
04:07:06.910 --> 04:07:06.920 align:start position:0%
could breed two pugs if they did not
 
04:07:08.389 --> 04:07:08.399 align:start position:0%
have the theform
 
04:07:09.950 --> 04:07:09.960 align:start position:0%
that's how the legislation reads I
 
04:07:12.630 --> 04:07:12.640 align:start position:0%
believe okay thank
 
04:07:16.189 --> 04:07:16.199 align:start position:0%
you represent ger thank you madam chair
 
04:07:17.269 --> 04:07:17.279 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question
 
04:07:18.550 --> 04:07:18.560 align:start position:0%
this is followup to representative
 
04:07:21.030 --> 04:07:21.040 align:start position:0%
kraton's question because there is the
 
04:07:24.469 --> 04:07:24.479 align:start position:0%
two pugs right to parse the sentence two
 
04:07:27.469 --> 04:07:27.479 align:start position:0%
pugs who have the deformity and then the
 
04:07:30.670 --> 04:07:30.680 align:start position:0%
clause which follows that is that causes
 
04:07:33.189 --> 04:07:33.199 align:start position:0%
suffering and this is where I get uh if
 
04:07:36.349 --> 04:07:36.359 align:start position:0%
you could perhaps speak to how we Define
 
04:07:38.469 --> 04:07:38.479 align:start position:0%
suffering and how this is going to be
 
04:07:41.189 --> 04:07:41.199 align:start position:0%
determined because as again just parsing
 
04:07:43.109 --> 04:07:43.119 align:start position:0%
that sentence it would seem to be that
 
04:07:47.229 --> 04:07:47.239 align:start position:0%
you could breed two Pugs that have the
 
04:07:50.510 --> 04:07:50.520 align:start position:0%
deformity if that deformity was judged
 
04:07:52.790 --> 04:07:52.800 align:start position:0%
not to be the cause of suffering and
 
04:07:55.710 --> 04:07:55.720 align:start position:0%
that raises a lot of questions about how
 
04:07:58.630 --> 04:07:58.640 align:start position:0%
suffering is defined and as I said who
 
04:08:00.790 --> 04:08:00.800 align:start position:0%
it is that is going to be determining
 
04:08:04.590 --> 04:08:04.600 align:start position:0%
that so could you help me understand how
 
04:08:08.189 --> 04:08:08.199 align:start position:0%
in practice that would work
 
04:08:11.309 --> 04:08:11.319 align:start position:0%
yeah so um thank you um I think that
 
04:08:13.149 --> 04:08:13.159 align:start position:0%
there are clearly some areas that need
 
04:08:16.269 --> 04:08:16.279 align:start position:0%
to be ironed out uh we discussed earlier
 
04:08:18.389 --> 04:08:18.399 align:start position:0%
a veterinarians assessment to determine
 
04:08:21.389 --> 04:08:21.399 align:start position:0%
whether or not an animal is suffering um
 
04:08:24.590 --> 04:08:24.600 align:start position:0%
that seems to be our best option right
 
04:08:26.950 --> 04:08:26.960 align:start position:0%
now thank you thank you madam chair
 
04:08:30.070 --> 04:08:30.080 align:start position:0%
representative Murray thank you um Madam
 
04:08:31.349 --> 04:08:31.359 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
04:08:33.630 --> 04:08:33.640 align:start position:0%
question so when with regard
 
04:08:37.149 --> 04:08:37.159 align:start position:0%
to asking a veterinarian then to take
 
04:08:40.990 --> 04:08:41.000 align:start position:0%
that on are there implications to making
 
04:08:43.149 --> 04:08:43.159 align:start position:0%
sure that that
 
04:08:46.229 --> 04:08:46.239 align:start position:0%
assessment um is prior to breeding or
 
04:08:49.670 --> 04:08:49.680 align:start position:0%
like how would that how would I guess to
 
04:08:52.910 --> 04:08:52.920 align:start position:0%
uh representative German's Point that's
 
04:08:55.309 --> 04:08:55.319 align:start position:0%
the question I guess yeah thank you I'm
 
04:08:57.070 --> 04:08:57.080 align:start position:0%
I'm not a dog breeder I don't know too
 
04:08:59.189 --> 04:08:59.199 align:start position:0%
much about how that world works you know
 
04:09:00.950 --> 04:09:00.960 align:start position:0%
how how dogs are approved to breed or
 
04:09:03.149 --> 04:09:03.159 align:start position:0%
not I know it's very well regulated I
 
04:09:04.630 --> 04:09:04.640 align:start position:0%
would think you could insert something
 
04:09:07.990 --> 04:09:08.000 align:start position:0%
in there that would you know um Ensure
 
04:09:10.189 --> 04:09:10.199 align:start position:0%
that the animal didn't have a deformity
 
04:09:12.349 --> 04:09:12.359 align:start position:0%
causing it to suffer before you allowed
 
04:09:15.229 --> 04:09:15.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:17.950 --> 04:09:17.960 align:start position:0%
bred representative
 
04:09:21.630 --> 04:09:21.640 align:start position:0%
Bixby U have you had any experience with
 
04:09:23.469 --> 04:09:23.479 align:start position:0%
animal cruelty
 
04:09:26.070 --> 04:09:26.080 align:start position:0%
investigations I have not okay then I
 
04:09:28.030 --> 04:09:28.040 align:start position:0%
will save my question for someone else
 
04:09:28.040 --> 04:09:29.309 align:start position:0%
will save my question for someone else
thank

04:09:29.309 --> 04:09:29.319 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:09:31.670 --> 04:09:31.680 align:start position:0%
you thank you any other questions from
 
04:09:34.070 --> 04:09:34.080 align:start position:0%

welcome thank you thank you madam chair
 
04:10:04.070 --> 04:10:04.080 align:start position:0%
and members of the committee for uh
 
04:10:05.950 --> 04:10:05.960 align:start position:0%
being here and and
 
04:10:09.309 --> 04:10:09.319 align:start position:0%
listening um my name is Bernice Sullivan
 
04:10:12.830 --> 04:10:12.840 align:start position:0%
um I live in Wentworth and um I'm here
 
04:10:14.870 --> 04:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
as representing myself and also the
 
04:10:16.830 --> 04:10:16.840 align:start position:0%
Irish Terrier Club of
 
04:10:20.710 --> 04:10:20.720 align:start position:0%
America um I'm in opposition to HB 1102
 
04:10:22.750 --> 04:10:22.760 align:start position:0%
for many reasons but what I would like
 
04:10:25.910 --> 04:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
to speak about today is genetics and I'm
 
04:10:27.950 --> 04:10:27.960 align:start position:0%
sure you all got up this morning and
 
04:10:31.469 --> 04:10:31.479 align:start position:0%
thought I can't wait to hear about
 
04:10:34.630 --> 04:10:34.640 align:start position:0%
genetics um but it's it it'll be very
 
04:10:37.189 --> 04:10:37.199 align:start position:0%
brief um two of the things that breeders
 
04:10:39.189 --> 04:10:39.199 align:start position:0%
can consider when breeding are phenotype
 
04:10:42.670 --> 04:10:42.680 align:start position:0%
and genotype in basic terms phenotype is
 
04:10:45.469 --> 04:10:45.479 align:start position:0%
what the animal looks like genotype is a
 
04:10:47.349 --> 04:10:47.359 align:start position:0%
compilation of all the genes both
 
04:10:49.630 --> 04:10:49.640 align:start position:0%
recessive and dominant that make up the
 
04:10:49.640 --> 04:10:51.229 align:start position:0%
recessive and dominant that make up the
animal's

04:10:51.229 --> 04:10:51.239 align:start position:0%
animal's
 
04:10:53.870 --> 04:10:53.880 align:start position:0%
genome the scientific word that vets
 
04:10:55.950 --> 04:10:55.960 align:start position:0%
used to describe short-nosed or
 
04:10:59.269 --> 04:10:59.279 align:start position:0%
flat-faced dogs is brachy calic this
 
04:11:01.870 --> 04:11:01.880 align:start position:0%
comes from two Greek words meaning short
 
04:11:05.590 --> 04:11:05.600 align:start position:0%
and head brachy describes any dog
 
04:11:08.030 --> 04:11:08.040 align:start position:0%
whose muzzle has a short or pushed in
 
04:11:11.030 --> 04:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
appearance braches spyic is a word used
 
04:11:12.429 --> 04:11:12.439 align:start position:0%
to describe
 
04:11:15.670 --> 04:11:15.680 align:start position:0%
phenotype it is not a condition nor is
 
04:11:18.189 --> 04:11:18.199 align:start position:0%
it a disease or a
 
04:11:20.630 --> 04:11:20.640 align:start position:0%
deformity breeders are trying to produce
 
04:11:22.950 --> 04:11:22.960 align:start position:0%
puppies that meet their breed standard
 
04:11:25.269 --> 04:11:25.279 align:start position:0%
most breed standards arise from and
 
04:11:27.309 --> 04:11:27.319 align:start position:0%
Encompass the original or current
 
04:11:30.349 --> 04:11:30.359 align:start position:0%
purpose of the breed in no cases do
 
04:11:33.389 --> 04:11:33.399 align:start position:0%
breed standards call for a breed to be
 
04:11:36.429 --> 04:11:36.439 align:start position:0%
deformed or to breed dogs to suffer
 
04:11:38.790 --> 04:11:38.800 align:start position:0%
language contained in HB
 
04:11:41.790 --> 04:11:41.800 align:start position:0%
1102 including a word like braches spalc
 
04:11:43.910 --> 04:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
which is descriptive of a type of skull
 
04:11:46.950 --> 04:11:46.960 align:start position:0%
structure in a law about animal cruelty
 
04:11:49.870 --> 04:11:49.880 align:start position:0%
is a false equivalency of a body
 
04:11:51.950 --> 04:11:51.960 align:start position:0%
structure with a potential Health
 
04:11:54.389 --> 04:11:54.399 align:start position:0%
complication which could
 
04:11:56.630 --> 04:11:56.640 align:start position:0%
arise there are many illnesses or
 
04:11:58.070 --> 04:11:58.080 align:start position:0%
injuries that can be linked to
 
04:12:01.309 --> 04:12:01.319 align:start position:0%
structural issues is a breed with long

legs that is more apt to tear an ACL
 
04:12:07.309 --> 04:12:07.319 align:start position:0%
deformed is a dog with short legs bread
 
04:12:10.710 --> 04:12:10.720 align:start position:0%
to go into a small space to catch Vermin
 
04:12:13.109 --> 04:12:13.119 align:start position:0%

04:12:15.269 --> 04:12:15.279 align:start position:0%
constitutes these so-called
 
04:12:17.469 --> 04:12:17.479 align:start position:0%
deformities this type of language and
 
04:12:19.830 --> 04:12:19.840 align:start position:0%
legislation can lead to many more
 
04:12:21.990 --> 04:12:22.000 align:start position:0%
problems many more problems will the

next prohibited phenotype be condr
 
04:12:27.429 --> 04:12:27.439 align:start position:0%
dysplastic this could extend to
 
04:12:30.429 --> 04:12:30.439 align:start position:0%
agricultural animals briefly condr
 
04:12:32.510 --> 04:12:32.520 align:start position:0%
dysplasia describes animals with short
 
04:12:35.510 --> 04:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
legs this phenotype is characteristic of
 
04:12:37.510 --> 04:12:37.520 align:start position:0%
many breeds of dogs such as Cor ories
 
04:12:40.469 --> 04:12:40.479 align:start position:0%
and doxins it is also present in Irish
 
04:12:44.229 --> 04:12:44.239 align:start position:0%
Dexter cattle I used to breed Dexter the
 
04:12:46.950 --> 04:12:46.960 align:start position:0%
condro displasia trait in Dexter is a
 
04:12:49.309 --> 04:12:49.319 align:start position:0%
desired trait that came about because of
 
04:12:50.750 --> 04:12:50.760 align:start position:0%
a gene
 
04:12:54.349 --> 04:12:54.359 align:start position:0%
mutation it can also lead to dead
 
04:12:56.590 --> 04:12:56.600 align:start position:0%
calves um I'm going to cut it short
 
04:12:57.990 --> 04:12:58.000 align:start position:0%
because I know I'm approaching the end
 
04:13:00.510 --> 04:13:00.520 align:start position:0%
but fortunately the genetic component
 
04:13:03.189 --> 04:13:03.199 align:start position:0%
for this is a simple simple autosomal
 
04:13:06.750 --> 04:13:06.760 align:start position:0%
dominant gene and there's only a one in4
 
04:13:10.109 --> 04:13:10.119 align:start position:0%
chance if that can happen but there is a
 
04:13:10.119 --> 04:13:11.149 align:start position:0%
chance if that can happen but there is a
genetic

04:13:11.149 --> 04:13:11.159 align:start position:0%
genetic
 
04:13:15.790 --> 04:13:15.800 align:start position:0%
test so breeders don't breed those
 
04:13:18.630 --> 04:13:18.640 align:start position:0%
animals um this proposed language does
 
04:13:20.990 --> 04:13:21.000 align:start position:0%
nothing to prevent cruelty it merely
 
04:13:22.950 --> 04:13:22.960 align:start position:0%
muddles the waters around breeding and
 
04:13:25.710 --> 04:13:25.720 align:start position:0%
creates potential to reduce genetic
 
04:13:29.389 --> 04:13:29.399 align:start position:0%
diversity or even eliminate some reads
 
04:13:34.030 --> 04:13:34.040 align:start position:0%
entirely thank you represent ger thank
 
04:13:35.309 --> 04:13:35.319 align:start position:0%
you madam chair thank you for taking my
 
04:13:37.790 --> 04:13:37.800 align:start position:0%
question I appreciate the uh
 
04:13:40.429 --> 04:13:40.439 align:start position:0%
the science lesson is helpful uh and and
 
04:13:42.149 --> 04:13:42.159 align:start position:0%
the clarification about a phenotype
 
04:13:43.670 --> 04:13:43.680 align:start position:0%
we're talking about a phenotype when
 
04:13:46.790 --> 04:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
we're talking a bracky uh calic animals
 
04:13:48.229 --> 04:13:48.239 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering does it in your
 
04:13:50.950 --> 04:13:50.960 align:start position:0%
estimation make the bill any better if
 
04:13:54.630 --> 04:13:54.640 align:start position:0%
it were to specify um rather than the
 
04:13:57.510 --> 04:13:57.520 align:start position:0%
phenotype the syndrome that is often or
 
04:13:59.030 --> 04:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
at times at least associated with the
 
04:14:01.550 --> 04:14:01.560 align:start position:0%
phenotype right the brachy phalic airway
 
04:14:03.550 --> 04:14:03.560 align:start position:0%
obstruction syndrome does it make it
 
04:14:04.950 --> 04:14:04.960 align:start position:0%
better to say that you can't
 
04:14:07.750 --> 04:14:07.760 align:start position:0%
intentionally breed two animals who have
 
04:14:11.109 --> 04:14:11.119 align:start position:0%
the same syndrome which is by definition
 
04:14:15.389 --> 04:14:15.399 align:start position:0%
a pathological condition right um that
 
04:14:18.790 --> 04:14:18.800 align:start position:0%
would be very hard to determine ahead of
 
04:14:21.070 --> 04:14:21.080 align:start position:0%
time because does that does that animal
 
04:14:23.469 --> 04:14:23.479 align:start position:0%
develop it at one yearold twoy old
 
04:14:26.870 --> 04:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
fiveyear old um you know many many dogs
 
04:14:29.750 --> 04:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
are bred at two years of age so has it
 
04:14:32.469 --> 04:14:32.479 align:start position:0%
developed at that it also is a is a
 
04:14:34.790 --> 04:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
slippery slope kind of thing so if you
 
04:14:39.670 --> 04:14:39.680 align:start position:0%
have um two to breeding animals and you
 
04:14:42.870 --> 04:14:42.880 align:start position:0%
breed them and they have oh let's say a
 
04:14:45.229 --> 04:14:45.239 align:start position:0%
a cancer Gene and you know there's a
 
04:14:47.070 --> 04:14:47.080 align:start position:0%
history of uh
 
04:14:50.070 --> 04:14:50.080 align:start position:0%
osteosarcoma and they produce dog
 
04:14:51.590 --> 04:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
puppies that have that well you won't
 
04:14:55.229 --> 04:14:55.239 align:start position:0%
know that right away but there's a that
 
04:14:58.109 --> 04:14:58.119 align:start position:0%
there's that lurking genetic thing and
 
04:15:01.429 --> 04:15:01.439 align:start position:0%
that's still that causes suffering um
 
04:15:03.950 --> 04:15:03.960 align:start position:0%
but it's not something you can know when
 
04:15:06.510 --> 04:15:06.520 align:start position:0%
you're breeding may I follow up follow
 
04:15:08.990 --> 04:15:09.000 align:start position:0%
up sure thank you does the language in
 
04:15:11.229 --> 04:15:11.239 align:start position:0%
the B Bill about intentionality however
 
04:15:12.229 --> 04:15:12.239 align:start position:0%
deal with that because you're right you
 
04:15:13.790 --> 04:15:13.800 align:start position:0%
may not know at two years when you breed
 
04:15:16.269 --> 04:15:16.279 align:start position:0%
the dog and and in which case it's not
 
04:15:17.950 --> 04:15:17.960 align:start position:0%
intentional even if that dog were to
 
04:15:19.910 --> 04:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
develop the syndrome uh a couple of
 
04:15:21.389 --> 04:15:21.399 align:start position:0%
years later I'm just trying to
 
04:15:23.309 --> 04:15:23.319 align:start position:0%
understand I I I see difficulties and
 
04:15:24.469 --> 04:15:24.479 align:start position:0%
trying to sort this out but I'm
 
04:15:27.950 --> 04:15:27.960 align:start position:0%
wondering if intentionality covers the
 
04:15:31.229 --> 04:15:31.239 align:start position:0%
specific example you just referred to
 
04:15:34.070 --> 04:15:34.080 align:start position:0%
well yes and no because again if you get
 
04:15:35.590 --> 04:15:35.600 align:start position:0%
back to the questions that were asked
 
04:15:37.630 --> 04:15:37.640 align:start position:0%
about how does this get in forced and
 
04:15:42.429 --> 04:15:42.439 align:start position:0%
you have um people reporting someone
 
04:15:44.590 --> 04:15:44.600 align:start position:0%
because who's who's going to say what
 
04:15:46.510 --> 04:15:46.520 align:start position:0%
the intention was when they
 
04:15:49.510 --> 04:15:49.520 align:start position:0%
bred you know yes I know the genetic
 
04:15:52.830 --> 04:15:52.840 align:start position:0%
Legacy of any dogs I breed um but I
 
04:15:55.269 --> 04:15:55.279 align:start position:0%
don't know the percentage chance that a
 
04:15:57.429 --> 04:15:57.439 align:start position:0%
certain recessive gene might come
 
04:16:01.590 --> 04:16:01.600 align:start position:0%
forward um so there's there's that thank
 
04:16:04.269 --> 04:16:04.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:07.750 --> 04:16:07.760 align:start position:0%
much oh absolutely represent H Haskins
 
04:16:09.189 --> 04:16:09.199 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and thanks for
 
04:16:12.030 --> 04:16:12.040 align:start position:0%
taking my question I too was edified by
 
04:16:14.389 --> 04:16:14.399 align:start position:0%
this conversation I have an important
 
04:16:18.149 --> 04:16:18.159 align:start position:0%
question for you are Irish Terriers
 
04:16:21.429 --> 04:16:21.439 align:start position:0%
Breaky calic not at all no I just called
 
04:16:23.189 --> 04:16:23.199 align:start position:0%
it up on my phone because I wasn't
 
04:16:25.349 --> 04:16:25.359 align:start position:0%
familiar with it I wanted to clear that
 
04:16:28.950 --> 04:16:28.960 align:start position:0%
up okay no they're not um they there are
 
04:16:30.790 --> 04:16:30.800 align:start position:0%
there is a genetic condition which we're
 
04:16:34.870 --> 04:16:34.880 align:start position:0%
searching for a gene right now that um
 
04:16:37.229 --> 04:16:37.239 align:start position:0%
could potentially cause suffering it's a
 
04:16:40.349 --> 04:16:40.359 align:start position:0%
it's a um bladder stone type of thing
 
04:16:43.389 --> 04:16:43.399 align:start position:0%
and um we try not to breed for it but it
 
04:16:45.910 --> 04:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
can happen and until we find the gene we
 
04:16:47.750 --> 04:16:47.760 align:start position:0%
can't eliminate it
 
04:16:50.189 --> 04:16:50.199 align:start position:0%
entirely thank you representative
 
04:16:53.109 --> 04:16:53.119 align:start position:0%
victory yeah so um this is sort of
 
04:16:55.710 --> 04:16:55.720 align:start position:0%
getting into the the genetics a little
 
04:16:59.670 --> 04:16:59.680 align:start position:0%
bit more uh is it possible that when you
 
04:17:03.630 --> 04:17:03.640 align:start position:0%
are uh breeding for one particular trait
 
04:17:07.590 --> 04:17:07.600 align:start position:0%
um let's say you're breeding for t
 
04:17:11.309 --> 04:17:11.319 align:start position:0%
position uh and uh are there when you
 
04:17:13.630 --> 04:17:13.640 align:start position:0%
select for that is it possible that you
 
04:17:16.950 --> 04:17:16.960 align:start position:0%
will uh get other characteristics to
 
04:17:19.189 --> 04:17:19.199 align:start position:0%
change at the same time because they're
 
04:17:22.309 --> 04:17:22.319 align:start position:0%
linked absolutely like maybe pus goes
 
04:17:24.189 --> 04:17:24.199 align:start position:0%
along with FY ears or something
 
04:17:26.910 --> 04:17:26.920 align:start position:0%
absolutely and and a lot of that
 
04:17:30.109 --> 04:17:30.119 align:start position:0%
breeding is an science and it's an art
 
04:17:33.229 --> 04:17:33.239 align:start position:0%
and it's a lot of luck too um so yes
 
04:17:35.550 --> 04:17:35.560 align:start position:0%
there are there are linked things and
 
04:17:37.910 --> 04:17:37.920 align:start position:0%
sometimes you you can predict them and
 
04:17:41.870 --> 04:17:41.880 align:start position:0%
sometimes you can't thank you any other
 
04:17:43.790 --> 04:17:43.800 align:start position:0%
questions thank you ma'am appreciate
 
04:17:46.189 --> 04:17:46.199 align:start position:0%
your testimony thank you for uh hearing
 
04:18:00.950 --> 04:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:03.189 --> 04:18:03.199 align:start position:0%
please thank you everyone thank you to
 
04:18:05.550 --> 04:18:05.560 align:start position:0%
the committee uh my name is Eliza Berg
 
04:18:07.870 --> 04:18:07.880 align:start position:0%
born and raised in sandwi New Hampshire
 
04:18:11.550 --> 04:18:11.560 align:start position:0%
I'm here today to uh support this bill
 
04:18:13.189 --> 04:18:13.199 align:start position:0%
and tell you about my dog
 
04:18:16.790 --> 04:18:16.800 align:start position:0%
penny so I spent hours doing extensive
 
04:18:19.070 --> 04:18:19.080 align:start position:0%
research on the French Bulldog breed and
 
04:18:21.309 --> 04:18:21.319 align:start position:0%
spoke to countless potential breeders
 
04:18:23.109 --> 04:18:23.119 align:start position:0%
those hours of research alerted me to
 
04:18:24.830 --> 04:18:24.840 align:start position:0%
the potential challenges that we might
 
04:18:27.469 --> 04:18:27.479 align:start position:0%
face having to be careful of her back
 
04:18:30.149 --> 04:18:30.159 align:start position:0%
and watch out for IBD or introver table
 
04:18:32.389 --> 04:18:32.399 align:start position:0%
disc disease being fastidious about
 
04:18:34.550 --> 04:18:34.560 align:start position:0%
cleaning her wrinkles and tail pocket
 
04:18:36.910 --> 04:18:36.920 align:start position:0%
making sure she doesn't get overheated
 
04:18:40.429 --> 04:18:40.439 align:start position:0%
um due to her flat face I did not once
 
04:18:42.070 --> 04:18:42.080 align:start position:0%
come across the term braches spyic
 
04:18:45.109 --> 04:18:45.119 align:start position:0%
obstructive Airway syndrome or boas fast
 
04:18:47.670 --> 04:18:47.680 align:start position:0%
forward a few months I had found myself
 
04:18:50.550 --> 04:18:50.560 align:start position:0%
a preservation breeder in Ohio who owned
 
04:18:52.389 --> 04:18:52.399 align:start position:0%
a dog that was The Sire for a litter of
 
04:18:53.950 --> 04:18:53.960 align:start position:0%
puppies being raised by her friend in
 
04:18:56.389 --> 04:18:56.399 align:start position:0%
mentee this breeder passed all the tests
 
04:18:58.510 --> 04:18:58.520 align:start position:0%
I had learned to look for not breeding
 
04:19:00.670 --> 04:19:00.680 align:start position:0%
for fad colors breeding to the standard
 
04:19:03.229 --> 04:19:03.239 align:start position:0%
doing the right Health testing and so on
 
04:19:05.389 --> 04:19:05.399 align:start position:0%
Penny was the smallest of the litter um
 
04:19:07.149 --> 04:19:07.159 align:start position:0%
so the Breeders vet did some additional
 
04:19:08.710 --> 04:19:08.720 align:start position:0%
testing on her she was cleared to come
 
04:19:11.469 --> 04:19:11.479 align:start position:0%
home with us at 10 weeks just one week
 
04:19:13.309 --> 04:19:13.319 align:start position:0%
after bringing Penny home she vomited
 
04:19:15.189 --> 04:19:15.199 align:start position:0%
and collapsed on the floor one evening
 
04:19:16.950 --> 04:19:16.960 align:start position:0%
we rushed her to the emergency pet
 
04:19:20.149 --> 04:19:20.159 align:start position:0%
hospital Penny was extremely anemic and
 
04:19:21.750 --> 04:19:21.760 align:start position:0%
received a blood transfusion to save her
 
04:19:23.870 --> 04:19:23.880 align:start position:0%
life this began a multi-year journey to
 
04:19:25.630 --> 04:19:25.640 align:start position:0%
diagnose penny with iron deficiency
 
04:19:27.870 --> 04:19:27.880 align:start position:0%
anemia caused by internal bleeding that
 
04:19:30.149 --> 04:19:30.159 align:start position:0%
still has an unknown cause she's since
 
04:19:31.790 --> 04:19:31.800 align:start position:0%
had one more blood transfusion to save
 
04:19:33.910 --> 04:19:33.920 align:start position:0%
her life around the same time that we
 
04:19:35.389 --> 04:19:35.399 align:start position:0%
were struggling to get answers for her
 
04:19:36.870 --> 04:19:36.880 align:start position:0%
anemia we became concerned concerned
 
04:19:39.349 --> 04:19:39.359 align:start position:0%
with her breathing she snored to a point
 
04:19:40.870 --> 04:19:40.880 align:start position:0%
where I could not fathom that she was
 
04:19:44.030 --> 04:19:44.040 align:start position:0%
getting any Oxygen at all and would have
 
04:19:46.109 --> 04:19:46.119 align:start position:0%
occasional bouts of regurgitation and
 
04:19:48.269 --> 04:19:48.279 align:start position:0%
exercise intolerance thanks to a
 
04:19:50.269 --> 04:19:50.279 align:start position:0%
Facebook group called balic breathing
 
04:19:52.070 --> 04:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
awareness I quickly learned more about
 
04:19:53.910 --> 04:19:53.920 align:start position:0%
boas and the surgical options available
 
04:19:56.510 --> 04:19:56.520 align:start position:0%
to US penny saw one of the best soft
 
04:19:59.070 --> 04:19:59.080 align:start position:0%
Tiss tissue surgeons in the Boston area
 
04:20:00.710 --> 04:20:00.720 align:start position:0%
and had her soft pallet shortened and
 
04:20:03.429 --> 04:20:03.439 align:start position:0%
her nostrils expanded these surgeries
 
04:20:05.469 --> 04:20:05.479 align:start position:0%
are necessary because dogs like Penny
 
04:20:07.389 --> 04:20:07.399 align:start position:0%
are bred so that their internal Airway
 
04:20:08.950 --> 04:20:08.960 align:start position:0%
has become cramped and they spend their
 
04:20:10.389 --> 04:20:10.399 align:start position:0%
lives struggling to get enough air into
 
04:20:13.149 --> 04:20:13.159 align:start position:0%
their lungs Penny's story is a sad one
 
04:20:15.070 --> 04:20:15.080 align:start position:0%
but as far as I can tell she's a success
 
04:20:17.389 --> 04:20:17.399 align:start position:0%
story for a French Bulldog her symptoms
 
04:20:19.070 --> 04:20:19.080 align:start position:0%
weren't that severe and she's had a
 
04:20:20.590 --> 04:20:20.600 align:start position:0%
relatively happy life although we
 
04:20:22.710 --> 04:20:22.720 align:start position:0%
continually uh worry about her and she
 
04:20:25.590 --> 04:20:25.600 align:start position:0%
may need surgery again there are over
 
04:20:28.590 --> 04:20:28.600 align:start position:0%
23,000 people in this Facebook group for
 
04:20:30.349 --> 04:20:30.359 align:start position:0%
a while after her surgery I tried to go
 
04:20:32.229 --> 04:20:32.239 align:start position:0%
on and answer people's questions giving
 
04:20:34.429 --> 04:20:34.439 align:start position:0%
them support and the hope that I once
 
04:20:37.030 --> 04:20:37.040 align:start position:0%
needed um to not despair
 
04:20:38.950 --> 04:20:38.960 align:start position:0%
after a while uh it became too
 
04:20:40.870 --> 04:20:40.880 align:start position:0%
depressing and frustrating to see every
 
04:20:43.309 --> 04:20:43.319 align:start position:0%
day new people coming on not knowing how
 
04:20:45.070 --> 04:20:45.080 align:start position:0%
to help their dogs that are suffering
 
04:20:46.990 --> 04:20:47.000 align:start position:0%
and how many owners are woefully unaware
 
04:20:49.109 --> 04:20:49.119 align:start position:0%
of the basics of boas and the options
 
04:20:53.389 --> 04:20:53.399 align:start position:0%
for care penny has required over $34,000
 
04:20:55.429 --> 04:20:55.439 align:start position:0%
in vet and testing costs pet insurance
 
04:20:57.510 --> 04:20:57.520 align:start position:0%
bills hours spent educating myself and
 
04:20:59.870 --> 04:20:59.880 align:start position:0%
advocating for my dog just so that she
 
04:21:02.189 --> 04:21:02.199 align:start position:0%
can live what I hope is a comfortable
 
04:21:05.229 --> 04:21:05.239 align:start position:0%
life there are tens of thousands of dogs
 
04:21:07.630 --> 04:21:07.640 align:start position:0%
who don't have that luxury
 
04:21:10.389 --> 04:21:10.399 align:start position:0%
thank you and I'm happy to answer any
 
04:21:13.990 --> 04:21:14.000 align:start position:0%
questions representative C thank you uh

04:21:23.239 --> 04:21:26.149 align:start position:0%
questions thank you ma'am appreciate
your

04:21:26.149 --> 04:21:26.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:30.750 --> 04:21:30.760 align:start position:0%
testimony if I could call uh Taylor
 
04:21:35.429 --> 04:21:35.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:35.439 --> 04:21:49.269 align:start position:0%
 
you

04:21:49.269 --> 04:21:49.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:51.469 --> 04:21:51.479 align:start position:0%
thank you Vice chairman kraton and
 
04:21:53.109 --> 04:21:53.119 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for having me
 
04:21:55.750 --> 04:21:55.760 align:start position:0%
today to speak to you about House Bill
 
04:21:59.109 --> 04:21:59.119 align:start position:0%
1102 my name is Taylor llli and I am
 
04:22:01.269 --> 04:22:01.279 align:start position:0%
here on behalf of the pet advocacy
 
04:22:04.389 --> 04:22:04.399 align:start position:0%
Network the pet advocacy Network
 
04:22:06.670 --> 04:22:06.680 align:start position:0%
represents the responsible pet Care
 
04:22:09.189 --> 04:22:09.199 align:start position:0%
community in New Hampshire and Across
 
04:22:12.830 --> 04:22:12.840 align:start position:0%
the Nation so today we are here to urge
 
04:22:16.030 --> 04:22:16.040 align:start position:0%
you to vote no on House Bill 1102 the
 
04:22:18.149 --> 04:22:18.159 align:start position:0%
bill that criminalizes selling an animal
 
04:22:20.349 --> 04:22:20.359 align:start position:0%
with any birth deformity that causes
 
04:22:23.870 --> 04:22:23.880 align:start position:0%
suffering and cites brais Val as an
 
04:22:26.630 --> 04:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
example brochis Val is not formally
 
04:22:29.109 --> 04:22:29.119 align:start position:0%
defined in state law or veterinary
 
04:22:31.429 --> 04:22:31.439 align:start position:0%
medicine and this leaves a lot of room
 
04:22:34.510 --> 04:22:34.520 align:start position:0%
for inconsistent and subjective
 
04:22:36.630 --> 04:22:36.640 align:start position:0%
interpretation this also makes the bill
 
04:22:38.389 --> 04:22:38.399 align:start position:0%
unenforceable which I know we've talked
 
04:22:40.389 --> 04:22:40.399 align:start position:0%
about today due to conflicting
 
04:22:42.309 --> 04:22:42.319 align:start position:0%
interpretations that may
 
04:22:45.189 --> 04:22:45.199 align:start position:0%
arise this bill is also it's an attack
 
04:22:48.030 --> 04:22:48.040 align:start position:0%
on breeders pet stores and pet owners as
 
04:22:50.309 --> 04:22:50.319 align:start position:0%
short muzzled dogs has been bred for
 
04:22:53.189 --> 04:22:53.199 align:start position:0%
thousands of years we know in fact that
 
04:22:55.349 --> 04:22:55.359 align:start position:0%
the four of the most popular dog breeds
 
04:22:58.790 --> 04:22:58.800 align:start position:0%
of 2022 could be classified as braches
 
04:23:01.510 --> 04:23:01.520 align:start position:0%
phallic including number one which was
 
04:23:02.550 --> 04:23:02.560 align:start position:0%
the French
 
04:23:05.109 --> 04:23:05.119 align:start position:0%
Bulldog there are also beloved and
 
04:23:07.910 --> 04:23:07.920 align:start position:0%
popular brais cat breeds including the
 
04:23:11.990 --> 04:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
Burmese Himalayan and Persian as well so
 
04:23:13.750 --> 04:23:13.760 align:start position:0%
because of this we know that if this
 
04:23:16.189 --> 04:23:16.199 align:start position:0%
bill passes demand for these animals
 
04:23:18.870 --> 04:23:18.880 align:start position:0%
will not go down and instead this will
 
04:23:20.870 --> 04:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
force Granite Staters to go out of state
 
04:23:24.030 --> 04:23:24.040 align:start position:0%
or online to obtain these popular
 
04:23:27.229 --> 04:23:27.239 align:start position:0%
animals as you've heard today the degree
 
04:23:30.870 --> 04:23:30.880 align:start position:0%
of brais falic traits can vary um
 
04:23:33.710 --> 04:23:33.720 align:start position:0%
responsible breeders uh they avoid
 
04:23:35.910 --> 04:23:35.920 align:start position:0%
producing animals with Boaz as you've
 
04:23:37.790 --> 04:23:37.800 align:start position:0%
heard before from some of the Breeders
 
04:23:39.830 --> 04:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
that have testified and this is
 
04:23:42.389 --> 04:23:42.399 align:start position:0%
mitigated through careful stewardship
 
04:23:44.990 --> 04:23:45.000 align:start position:0%
and public education we know that
 
04:23:47.189 --> 04:23:47.199 align:start position:0%
responsible breeders are Health testing
 
04:23:49.070 --> 04:23:49.080 align:start position:0%
their animals they're also educating the
 
04:23:51.229 --> 04:23:51.239 align:start position:0%
families that purchase these animals on
 
04:23:54.349 --> 04:23:54.359 align:start position:0%
any issues that can arise or any special
 
04:23:57.309 --> 04:23:57.319 align:start position:0%
care that they need so we believe at the
 
04:23:59.750 --> 04:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
pet advocacy Network that the health of
 
04:24:02.550 --> 04:24:02.560 align:start position:0%
an animal is a conversation between an
 
04:24:05.830 --> 04:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
owner and their veterinarian because of
 
04:24:07.990 --> 04:24:08.000 align:start position:0%
that we ask you today to vote no on
 
04:24:11.070 --> 04:24:11.080 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1102 and instead work with us
 
04:24:13.389 --> 04:24:13.399 align:start position:0%
to find effective ways to promote animal
 
04:24:16.229 --> 04:24:16.239 align:start position:0%
welfare in New Hampshire thank
 
04:24:18.429 --> 04:24:18.439 align:start position:0%
you thank you ma'am do we have any
 
04:24:22.710 --> 04:24:22.720 align:start position:0%
questions from committee representative
 
04:24:22.720 --> 04:24:24.030 align:start position:0%
questions from committee representative
Geron

04:24:24.030 --> 04:24:24.040 align:start position:0%
Geron
 
04:24:26.229 --> 04:24:26.239 align:start position:0%
sir thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
04:24:28.950 --> 04:24:28.960 align:start position:0%
taking my question I just thinking about
 
04:24:30.630 --> 04:24:30.640 align:start position:0%
the pointing out that you know we're
 
04:24:33.910 --> 04:24:33.920 align:start position:0%
talking about the four most popular
 
04:24:36.950 --> 04:24:36.960 align:start position:0%
breeds on some level doesn't that make
 
04:24:38.590 --> 04:24:38.600 align:start position:0%
legislation like this a little bit more
 
04:24:40.790 --> 04:24:40.800 align:start position:0%
meaningful in the sense that and I I
 
04:24:42.710 --> 04:24:42.720 align:start position:0%
hear we're going to hear testimony over
 
04:24:44.109 --> 04:24:44.119 align:start position:0%
and over and over again about
 
04:24:46.870 --> 04:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
responsible breeders I think I hope
 
04:24:48.349 --> 04:24:48.359 align:start position:0%
we're all on the same page about that
 
04:24:51.309 --> 04:24:51.319 align:start position:0%
but the popularity of these animals also
 
04:24:53.550 --> 04:24:53.560 align:start position:0%
increases the likelihood of breeders who
 
04:24:55.269 --> 04:24:55.279 align:start position:0%
are not responsible who are meeting a
 
04:24:58.670 --> 04:24:58.680 align:start position:0%
market demand and it it also means that
 
04:25:00.750 --> 04:25:00.760 align:start position:0%
popularity means that we likely to see a
 
04:25:03.710 --> 04:25:03.720 align:start position:0%
lot of people who are wanting to
 
04:25:06.149 --> 04:25:06.159 align:start position:0%
purchase these animals because of the
 
04:25:08.710 --> 04:25:08.720 align:start position:0%
aesthetic of it which again it leads
 
04:25:10.550 --> 04:25:10.560 align:start position:0%
toward breeding animals with shorter
 
04:25:13.550 --> 04:25:13.560 align:start position:0%
features so um do you think that the
 
04:25:16.189 --> 04:25:16.199 align:start position:0%
fact that they are more and more
 
04:25:19.389 --> 04:25:19.399 align:start position:0%
popular could in fact lead to more and
 
04:25:21.550 --> 04:25:21.560 align:start position:0%
more animals being bred for a market
 
04:25:24.830 --> 04:25:24.840 align:start position:0%
that suffer from some for example Boaz
 
04:25:27.990 --> 04:25:28.000 align:start position:0%
so I think that any breed is susceptible
 
04:25:29.790 --> 04:25:29.800 align:start position:0%
to health issues I think you've heard
 
04:25:33.070 --> 04:25:33.080 align:start position:0%
about some cancers in German or golden
 
04:25:34.710 --> 04:25:34.720 align:start position:0%
retrievers hip dysplasia and German
 
04:25:36.550 --> 04:25:36.560 align:start position:0%
Shepherds but I think I think what's
 
04:25:39.469 --> 04:25:39.479 align:start position:0%
important here is that these breeds
 
04:25:42.670 --> 04:25:42.680 align:start position:0%
although popular that bralic does not
 
04:25:44.990 --> 04:25:45.000 align:start position:0%
equate to unhealthy you have heard about
 
04:25:47.550 --> 04:25:47.560 align:start position:0%
Boaz which can be an issue that arises
 
04:25:49.510 --> 04:25:49.520 align:start position:0%
in these breeds but our view on that is
 
04:25:51.229 --> 04:25:51.239 align:start position:0%
that that is something a veterinarian
 
04:25:52.830 --> 04:25:52.840 align:start position:0%
should address not
 
04:25:54.990 --> 04:25:55.000 align:start position:0%
legislation um and again these breeds
 
04:25:56.990 --> 04:25:57.000 align:start position:0%
are very popular and they're also very
 
04:25:58.510 --> 04:25:58.520 align:start position:0%
expensive when you're getting them from
 
04:26:01.070 --> 04:26:01.080 align:start position:0%
breeders so as was pointed out before
 
04:26:03.149 --> 04:26:03.159 align:start position:0%
people who are paying this much money
 
04:26:05.309 --> 04:26:05.319 align:start position:0%
for an animal are doing their research
 
04:26:06.990 --> 04:26:07.000 align:start position:0%
about the healthy issues that can arise
 
04:26:09.030 --> 04:26:09.040 align:start position:0%
and having those conversations with fets
 
04:26:09.040 --> 04:26:09.830 align:start position:0%
and having those conversations with fets
as

04:26:09.830 --> 04:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
as
 
04:26:13.229 --> 04:26:13.239 align:start position:0%
well thank you thank you for your
 
04:26:16.710 --> 04:26:16.720 align:start position:0%
question I do have a question and it's
 
04:26:18.590 --> 04:26:18.600 align:start position:0%
similar to one I asked a minute because
 
04:26:20.550 --> 04:26:20.560 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to come to grips with it
 
04:26:22.590 --> 04:26:22.600 align:start position:0%
as you read
 
04:26:25.149 --> 04:26:25.159 align:start position:0%
this um proposed
 
04:26:29.389 --> 04:26:29.399 align:start position:0%
legislation in your mind does this
 
04:26:31.910 --> 04:26:31.920 align:start position:0%
legislation indicate that you will not
 
04:26:35.830 --> 04:26:35.840 align:start position:0%
or cannot legally breed these animals so
 
04:26:38.030 --> 04:26:38.040 align:start position:0%
that that's how I'm reading it um again
 
04:26:41.070 --> 04:26:41.080 align:start position:0%
it is fairly vague so and I think it
 
04:26:43.429 --> 04:26:43.439 align:start position:0%
leads to subjective interpretation which
 
04:26:45.269 --> 04:26:45.279 align:start position:0%
is part of the issue that people can
 
04:26:48.429 --> 04:26:48.439 align:start position:0%
interpret this multiple ways again
 
04:26:51.070 --> 04:26:51.080 align:start position:0%
that's going to make it really hard to
 
04:26:54.950 --> 04:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
enforce and so you do not differentiate
 
04:27:00.070 --> 04:27:00.080 align:start position:0%
the difference between a pug for
 
04:27:03.229 --> 04:27:03.239 align:start position:0%
example without deformity that causes
 
04:27:06.429 --> 04:27:06.439 align:start position:0%
suffering versus a pug that has
 
04:27:09.469 --> 04:27:09.479 align:start position:0%
deformity or suffering I don't think
 
04:27:12.469 --> 04:27:12.479 align:start position:0%
this bill specifies Boaz is if I think
 
04:27:13.790 --> 04:27:13.800 align:start position:0%
that's what you're asking me I don't
 
04:27:16.630 --> 04:27:16.640 align:start position:0%
think it's speaking directly to these
 
04:27:18.550 --> 04:27:18.560 align:start position:0%
animals that have breathing issues I
 
04:27:21.030 --> 04:27:21.040 align:start position:0%
think it's encompassing them as a whole
 
04:27:23.510 --> 04:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
um I do think that that's something that
 
04:27:25.349 --> 04:27:25.359 align:start position:0%
could be split out but again I don't
 
04:27:26.750 --> 04:27:26.760 align:start position:0%
think that that would have
 
04:27:28.510 --> 04:27:28.520 align:start position:0%
enforceability as well and therefore
 
04:27:31.189 --> 04:27:31.199 align:start position:0%
should just be left up to pet owners and
 
04:27:34.510 --> 04:27:34.520 align:start position:0%
their vets okay thank you thank you any
 
04:27:36.510 --> 04:27:36.520 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
04:27:38.550 --> 04:27:38.560 align:start position:0%
okay thank you so much thank you and if
 
04:27:53.950 --> 04:27:53.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:56.429 --> 04:27:56.439 align:start position:0%
please good afternoon Vice chair and
 
04:27:58.349 --> 04:27:58.359 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is
 
04:28:00.630 --> 04:28:00.640 align:start position:0%
Ashley Monty and I'm here on behalf of
 
04:28:01.910 --> 04:28:01.920 align:start position:0%
people for the ethical treatment of
 
04:28:04.510 --> 04:28:04.520 align:start position:0%
animals and are more than 31,000 members
 
04:28:06.710 --> 04:28:06.720 align:start position:0%
and supporters in New Hampshire to
 
04:28:10.269 --> 04:28:10.279 align:start position:0%
express our support of House Bill
 
04:28:12.870 --> 04:28:12.880 align:start position:0%
1102 with breeders turning out more
 
04:28:15.429 --> 04:28:15.439 align:start position:0%
congenitally unhealthy dogs than ever we
 
04:28:17.750 --> 04:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
are in urgent need of legislation to
 
04:28:19.710 --> 04:28:19.720 align:start position:0%
protect animals from being intentionally
 
04:28:22.710 --> 04:28:22.720 align:start position:0%
bred to have deformities like braisy
 
04:28:25.349 --> 04:28:25.359 align:start position:0%
which causes them a lifetime of
 
04:28:27.630 --> 04:28:27.640 align:start position:0%
suffering brais spelic animals like
 
04:28:29.990 --> 04:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
French bulldogs English Bulldogs pugs
 
04:28:31.830 --> 04:28:31.840 align:start position:0%
and Persian cats are bred to have
 
04:28:34.630 --> 04:28:34.640 align:start position:0%
extremely abnormal and shortened muzzles
 
04:28:37.750 --> 04:28:37.760 align:start position:0%
small skulls and and deformed bodies
 
04:28:40.429 --> 04:28:40.439 align:start position:0%
there's overwhelming scientific evidence
 
04:28:41.990 --> 04:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
confirming that as a result of being
 
04:28:45.149 --> 04:28:45.159 align:start position:0%
bred to have unnaturally flat faces many
 
04:28:47.389 --> 04:28:47.399 align:start position:0%
of these brais phalic breeds suffer from
 
04:28:50.149 --> 04:28:50.159 align:start position:0%
terrible discomfort pain debilitating
 
04:28:52.349 --> 04:28:52.359 align:start position:0%
health issues including a condition
 
04:28:54.309 --> 04:28:54.319 align:start position:0%
called bralic obstructive Airway
 
04:28:56.590 --> 04:28:56.600 align:start position:0%
syndrome which causes them to struggle
 
04:28:58.269 --> 04:28:58.279 align:start position:0%
just to breathe and is actually the
 
04:29:00.030 --> 04:29:00.040 align:start position:0%
leading cause of death for
 
04:29:02.710 --> 04:29:02.720 align:start position:0%
Bulldogs research confirms that these
 
04:29:04.950 --> 04:29:04.960 align:start position:0%
flat-faced breathing impaired dogs have
 
04:29:07.429 --> 04:29:07.439 align:start position:0%
a significant shorter life expectancy
 
04:29:09.269 --> 04:29:09.279 align:start position:0%
than other breeds and are more likely to
 
04:29:11.309 --> 04:29:11.319 align:start position:0%
suffer from spinal and esophagal
 
04:29:13.790 --> 04:29:13.800 align:start position:0%
diseases cornal ulcerative disease and
 
04:29:15.790 --> 04:29:15.800 align:start position:0%
painful dental
 
04:29:18.030 --> 04:29:18.040 align:start position:0%
disease veterinarians around the world
 
04:29:19.950 --> 04:29:19.960 align:start position:0%
are sounding the alarm on the problems
 
04:29:21.469 --> 04:29:21.479 align:start position:0%
with these breeds and a number of
 
04:29:24.309 --> 04:29:24.319 align:start position:0%
countries including Austria Germany the
 
04:29:26.950 --> 04:29:26.960 align:start position:0%
Netherlands and Norway now restrict or
 
04:29:29.269 --> 04:29:29.279 align:start position:0%
prohibit their breeding which they refer
 
04:29:30.670 --> 04:29:30.680 align:start position:0%
to as torture
 
04:29:33.070 --> 04:29:33.080 align:start position:0%
breeding that's because purely for the
 
04:29:35.750 --> 04:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
purpose of achieving a flat-faced look
 
04:29:37.229 --> 04:29:37.239 align:start position:0%
these breeds have been bred so that
 
04:29:39.149 --> 04:29:39.159 align:start position:0%
their snouts are shortened and pushed so
 
04:29:41.030 --> 04:29:41.040 align:start position:0%
far back against their skulls and there
 
04:29:43.189 --> 04:29:43.199 align:start position:0%
isn't enough space to accommodate their
 
04:29:45.550 --> 04:29:45.560 align:start position:0%
normal anatomical features causing them
 
04:29:47.349 --> 04:29:47.359 align:start position:0%
immense pain and
 
04:29:49.590 --> 04:29:49.600 align:start position:0%
suffering breathing impaired breeds
 
04:29:51.389 --> 04:29:51.399 align:start position:0%
typically spend their lives struggling
 
04:29:53.469 --> 04:29:53.479 align:start position:0%
to breathe and many of them can't even
 
04:29:55.870 --> 04:29:55.880 align:start position:0%
enjoy the basic activities that make a
 
04:29:58.550 --> 04:29:58.560 align:start position:0%
dog's life enjoyable and fulfilling like
 
04:30:00.830 --> 04:30:00.840 align:start position:0%
going for a walk chasing a ball or
 
04:30:03.429 --> 04:30:03.439 align:start position:0%
playing with other dogs these animals
 
04:30:05.910 --> 04:30:05.920 align:start position:0%
spend their entire existence just trying
 
04:30:08.550 --> 04:30:08.560 align:start position:0%
to get enough air in their lungs anyone
 
04:30:09.830 --> 04:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
who has spent time with one of these
 
04:30:12.670 --> 04:30:12.680 align:start position:0%
dogs has likely heard them rasping and
 
04:30:14.710 --> 04:30:14.720 align:start position:0%
wheezing and those are the sounds of an
 
04:30:16.950 --> 04:30:16.960 align:start position:0%
animal struggling to breathe by
 
04:30:19.189 --> 04:30:19.199 align:start position:0%
supporting House Bill 112 which would
 
04:30:20.990 --> 04:30:21.000 align:start position:0%
ban this cruel practice of purposefully
 
04:30:23.229 --> 04:30:23.239 align:start position:0%
breeding chronically unhealthy breathing
 
04:30:25.149 --> 04:30:25.159 align:start position:0%
impaired breeds the committee will help
 
04:30:27.790 --> 04:30:27.800 align:start position:0%
protect vulnerable dogs and cats who now
 
04:30:30.830 --> 04:30:30.840 align:start position:0%
more than ever desperately need our help
 
04:30:33.349 --> 04:30:33.359 align:start position:0%
thank you for your consideration thank
 
04:30:36.229 --> 04:30:36.239 align:start position:0%

Hampshire I do not this is actually not
 
04:30:57.429 --> 04:30:57.439 align:start position:0%
my specific area of expertise I'm here
 
04:31:00.109 --> 04:31:00.119 align:start position:0%
just to present peta's position on the
 
04:31:00.119 --> 04:31:01.469 align:start position:0%
just to present peta's position on the
bill

04:31:01.469 --> 04:31:01.479 align:start position:0%
bill

04:31:25.710 --> 04:31:25.720 align:start position:0%
Alber good afternoon thank you for
 
04:31:28.389 --> 04:31:28.399 align:start position:0%
hearing me uh my name is Donna Alber I
 
04:31:31.750 --> 04:31:31.760 align:start position:0%
live in Lowden and I strongly oppose
 
04:31:33.790 --> 04:31:33.800 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
04:31:37.030 --> 04:31:37.040 align:start position:0%
1102 and for my I I got to shorten
 
04:31:38.910 --> 04:31:38.920 align:start position:0%
everything up here with three
 
04:31:41.870 --> 04:31:41.880 align:start position:0%
minutes um first I want to say that
 
04:31:43.790 --> 04:31:43.800 align:start position:0%
there are no breeders or anybody in this
 
04:31:46.550 --> 04:31:46.560 align:start position:0%
room that I feel wants to contribute to
 
04:31:48.950 --> 04:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
animal suffering we are not going to
 
04:31:51.229 --> 04:31:51.239 align:start position:0%
purposely put a pink and blue dog
 
04:31:52.510 --> 04:31:52.520 align:start position:0%
together because it's going to make
 
04:31:57.030 --> 04:31:57.040 align:start position:0%
purple and that's what people want um I
 
04:32:00.349 --> 04:32:00.359 align:start position:0%
am now with uh Boston Terriers and I'm
 
04:32:02.590 --> 04:32:02.600 align:start position:0%
also speaking on behalf of the Boston
 
04:32:06.309 --> 04:32:06.319 align:start position:0%
Terrier Club of America for this
 
04:32:09.109 --> 04:32:09.119 align:start position:0%
uh for just kind of a brief history I
 
04:32:10.910 --> 04:32:10.920 align:start position:0%
was raised in the dog show world my
 
04:32:12.950 --> 04:32:12.960 align:start position:0%
parents bred basset hounds my father was
 
04:32:15.630 --> 04:32:15.640 align:start position:0%
an AKC judge I did the whole Junior
 
04:32:19.149 --> 04:32:19.159 align:start position:0%
handling thing went to Westminster so I
 
04:32:22.510 --> 04:32:22.520 align:start position:0%
understand the confirmation breeding and
 
04:32:25.189 --> 04:32:25.199 align:start position:0%
again in my retirement I fell in love
 
04:32:27.550 --> 04:32:27.560 align:start position:0%
with Boston's and now I'm back at
 
04:32:30.309 --> 04:32:30.319 align:start position:0%
showing again I'm going to Westminster
 
04:32:34.309 --> 04:32:34.319 align:start position:0%
this year I want to breed and I have two
 
04:32:36.109 --> 04:32:36.119 align:start position:0%
that I would like to breed
 
04:32:39.910 --> 04:32:39.920 align:start position:0%
come the fall um so anyway to get back
 
04:32:43.389 --> 04:32:43.399 align:start position:0%
to that but also my education is in the
 
04:32:46.429 --> 04:32:46.439 align:start position:0%
animal um Veterinary field I've worked
 
04:32:48.109 --> 04:32:48.119 align:start position:0%
in animal
 
04:32:51.630 --> 04:32:51.640 align:start position:0%
hospitals since I was 15 years old till
 
04:32:54.630 --> 04:32:54.640 align:start position:0%
I retired I managed an emergency clinic
 
04:32:57.510 --> 04:32:57.520 align:start position:0%
in Manchester for two years prior to
 
04:33:00.149 --> 04:33:00.159 align:start position:0%
moving to Lowden and I have to say in
 
04:33:02.189 --> 04:33:02.199 align:start position:0%
all of those years experience I have
 
04:33:05.510 --> 04:33:05.520 align:start position:0%
never seen hardly any I really honestly
 
04:33:08.109 --> 04:33:08.119 align:start position:0%
can't remember any cases coming in with
 
04:33:11.150 --> 04:33:11.160 align:start position:0%
dogs struggling to breathe because of
 
04:33:14.949 --> 04:33:14.959 align:start position:0%
being a brachy spalc breed there's other
 
04:33:18.029 --> 04:33:18.039 align:start position:0%
factors the dog can be overweight the
 
04:33:20.109 --> 04:33:20.119 align:start position:0%
dog could have other health issues it
 
04:33:21.869 --> 04:33:21.879 align:start position:0%
could have allergies it could live in a
 
04:33:23.670 --> 04:33:23.680 align:start position:0%
household where there's chimney smokers
 
04:33:29.029 --> 04:33:29.039 align:start position:0%
smoking inside okay um one thing I do
 
04:33:31.949 --> 04:33:31.959 align:start position:0%
want to bring out um I do all the health
 
04:33:35.990 --> 04:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
testing that is required with a one
 
04:33:38.990 --> 04:33:39.000 align:start position:0%
results I learned about an hsf4 Gene
 
04:33:42.070 --> 04:33:42.080 align:start position:0%
that causes juvenile cataracts my dogs
 
04:33:44.070 --> 04:33:44.080 align:start position:0%
do not carry the gene they will not pass
 
04:33:45.949 --> 04:33:45.959 align:start position:0%
that along because that would cause a
 
04:33:47.910 --> 04:33:47.920 align:start position:0%
dog to go blind by the time it is two
 
04:33:49.750 --> 04:33:49.760 align:start position:0%
years old and that is certainly not
 
04:33:52.670 --> 04:33:52.680 align:start position:0%
something I'm going to do I had in here
 
04:33:54.910 --> 04:33:54.920 align:start position:0%
from the Boston terer Club of
 
04:33:58.590 --> 04:33:58.600 align:start position:0%
America um the required list of tests I
 
04:34:02.230 --> 04:34:02.240 align:start position:0%
can give copy of this out and they you
 
04:34:04.029 --> 04:34:04.039 align:start position:0%
go on a chick registry which is an
 
04:34:05.949 --> 04:34:05.959 align:start position:0%
online registry to show that you have
 
04:34:08.869 --> 04:34:08.879 align:start position:0%
done all the testing and people can look
 
04:34:11.629 --> 04:34:11.639 align:start position:0%
that up okay thank you you got 15
 
04:34:14.510 --> 04:34:14.520 align:start position:0%
seconds 15 seconds all right let me look
 
04:34:18.590 --> 04:34:18.600 align:start position:0%
in one second here um Boston Terriers
 
04:34:22.189 --> 04:34:22.199 align:start position:0%
excel in all performance Sports and it
 
04:34:25.670 --> 04:34:25.680 align:start position:0%
has been classed uh clocked in at 26.9 6
 
04:34:27.590 --> 04:34:27.600 align:start position:0%
miles an hour for one of them doing a
 
04:34:30.670 --> 04:34:30.680 align:start position:0%
fast cat run without having problems
 
04:34:33.629 --> 04:34:33.639 align:start position:0%
breathing okay they do dis dog dock
 
04:34:36.150 --> 04:34:36.160 align:start position:0%
diving type thing
 
04:34:40.990 --> 04:34:41.000 align:start position:0%
um fast cat The Obedience things they
 
04:34:42.670 --> 04:34:42.680 align:start position:0%
they don't have a problem breathing so I
 
04:34:43.551 --> 04:34:43.561 align:start position:0%
think the
 
04:34:47.470 --> 04:34:47.480 align:start position:0%
classify and group all these breeds into
 
04:34:50.629 --> 04:34:50.639 align:start position:0%
one dish is is wrong thank you ma'am
 
04:34:52.310 --> 04:34:52.320 align:start position:0%
appreciate your testimony any questions
 
04:34:54.269 --> 04:34:54.279 align:start position:0%
from the committee several
 
04:34:55.510 --> 04:34:55.520 align:start position:0%
representative H
 
04:34:58.230 --> 04:34:58.240 align:start position:0%
Haskins thank you thank you for taking
 
04:35:01.029 --> 04:35:01.039 align:start position:0%
my question I have a grand dog who's a
 
04:35:01.039 --> 04:35:02.750 align:start position:0%
my question I have a grand dog who's a
Boston

04:35:02.750 --> 04:35:02.760 align:start position:0%
Boston
 
04:35:06.269 --> 04:35:06.279 align:start position:0%
Terrier um so I'm struggling I thought
 
04:35:07.869 --> 04:35:07.879 align:start position:0%
when I came into this committee room
 
04:35:09.910 --> 04:35:09.920 align:start position:0%
today I knew exactly how I'd vote on
 
04:35:13.269 --> 04:35:13.279 align:start position:0%
this bill but Penny's story has turned
 
04:35:15.629 --> 04:35:15.639 align:start position:0%
me inside
 
04:35:18.949 --> 04:35:18.959 align:start position:0%
out um even though you haven't
 
04:35:21.789 --> 04:35:21.799 align:start position:0%
encountered these problems you don't
 
04:35:25.510 --> 04:35:25.520 align:start position:0%
disagree that they exist in other dogs
 
04:35:27.551 --> 04:35:27.561 align:start position:0%
they could possibly exist in some other
 
04:35:29.310 --> 04:35:29.320 align:start position:0%
dogs there could be other like I said
 
04:35:31.910 --> 04:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
other health issues that are adding
 
04:35:35.789 --> 04:35:35.799 align:start position:0%
to the you know having breathing issues
 
04:35:37.189 --> 04:35:37.199 align:start position:0%
um it sounds like there were other
 
04:35:38.949 --> 04:35:38.959 align:start position:0%
health issues going on because I don't
 
04:35:40.349 --> 04:35:40.359 align:start position:0%
know of any breathing disorder that's
 
04:35:42.910 --> 04:35:42.920 align:start position:0%
going to require blood transfusion so I
 
04:35:45.109 --> 04:35:45.119 align:start position:0%
think there was some other health issues
 
04:35:48.789 --> 04:35:48.799 align:start position:0%
going on but again I don't know you know
 
04:35:50.470 --> 04:35:50.480 align:start position:0%
I feel horrible for her to have gone
 
04:35:52.470 --> 04:35:52.480 align:start position:0%
through that and yes I have health
 
04:35:54.949 --> 04:35:54.959 align:start position:0%
insurance on my dogs but I will say one
 
04:35:57.189 --> 04:35:57.199 align:start position:0%
thing I've had one pug in my life which
 
04:35:59.789 --> 04:35:59.799 align:start position:0%
never had an issue breathing but I was
 
04:36:01.590 --> 04:36:01.600 align:start position:0%
concerned because we do a lot of camping
 
04:36:03.230 --> 04:36:03.240 align:start position:0%
and I'm thinking oh my gosh if we're way
 
04:36:05.670 --> 04:36:05.680 align:start position:0%
up North or whatever dog stung his
 
04:36:07.910 --> 04:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
throat swelling up I bought an endot
 
04:36:10.150 --> 04:36:10.160 align:start position:0%
tral tube and that stays with me all the
 
04:36:13.470 --> 04:36:13.480 align:start position:0%
time I have never had to use on the Pug
 
04:36:17.189 --> 04:36:17.199 align:start position:0%
I never had to use it on my other
 
04:36:21.109 --> 04:36:21.119 align:start position:0%
dogs follow if I may yes
 
04:36:24.349 --> 04:36:24.359 align:start position:0%
ma'am do you know whether Insurance pet
 
04:36:27.990 --> 04:36:28.000 align:start position:0%
insurance with which my son has on his
 
04:36:28.000 --> 04:36:29.230 align:start position:0%
insurance with which my son has on his
puppy

04:36:29.230 --> 04:36:29.240 align:start position:0%
puppy
 
04:36:35.750 --> 04:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
MH is um can you have insurance
 
04:36:39.590 --> 04:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
against a breed just because he's that
 
04:36:42.429 --> 04:36:42.439 align:start position:0%
breed and has perhaps a breathing
 
04:36:44.869 --> 04:36:44.879 align:start position:0%
problem are you saying not able to
 
04:36:47.109 --> 04:36:47.119 align:start position:0%
obtain insur insurance or will the
 
04:36:49.070 --> 04:36:49.080 align:start position:0%
insurance well whether yeah whether the
 
04:36:52.949 --> 04:36:52.959 align:start position:0%
insurance would cover um something
 
04:36:55.269 --> 04:36:55.279 align:start position:0%
that's uh just a manifestation of the
 
04:36:57.990 --> 04:36:58.000 align:start position:0%
breed I'm struggling you know to know
 
04:37:00.709 --> 04:37:00.719 align:start position:0%
how that would work are there are as
 
04:37:03.990 --> 04:37:04.000 align:start position:0%
many health insurance policies out there
 
04:37:08.070 --> 04:37:08.080 align:start position:0%
than there are St in the sky SAR sure um
 
04:37:10.470 --> 04:37:10.480 align:start position:0%
but as long as my understanding would be
 
04:37:12.990 --> 04:37:13.000 align:start position:0%
if it's a not a you know pre-existing
 
04:37:16.070 --> 04:37:16.080 align:start position:0%
condition there's the point then I would
 
04:37:18.750 --> 04:37:18.760 align:start position:0%
sure I would be confident saying it
 
04:37:20.629 --> 04:37:20.639 align:start position:0%
would be covered but again every
 
04:37:23.551 --> 04:37:23.561 align:start position:0%
policies are different thank you thank
 
04:37:25.629 --> 04:37:25.639 align:start position:0%
you manam representative K do you have a
 
04:37:28.189 --> 04:37:28.199 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair and thank
 
04:37:30.830 --> 04:37:30.840 align:start position:0%

questions thank you so much for your

testimony thank you for if I could call
 
04:38:03.910 --> 04:38:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:03.920 --> 04:38:12.349 align:start position:0%
 
gon

04:38:12.349 --> 04:38:12.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:14.709 --> 04:38:14.719 align:start position:0%
good afternoon everyone my name is Joel
 
04:38:17.789 --> 04:38:17.799 align:start position:0%
gon I live up in Hillsboro I came here
 
04:38:21.670 --> 04:38:21.680 align:start position:0%
today to speak in support of this
 
04:38:24.390 --> 04:38:24.400 align:start position:0%
legislation Banning the breeding of
 
04:38:28.189 --> 04:38:28.199 align:start position:0%
intentionally deformed animals like
 
04:38:31.349 --> 04:38:31.359 align:start position:0%
flatface breathing impaired breeds would
 
04:38:33.670 --> 04:38:33.680 align:start position:0%
protect countless dogs and cats who are
 
04:38:36.070 --> 04:38:36.080 align:start position:0%
currently forced to endure a lifetime of
 
04:38:37.949 --> 04:38:37.959 align:start position:0%
chronic and painful
 
04:38:41.189 --> 04:38:41.199 align:start position:0%
ailments these animals can suffer
 
04:38:43.949 --> 04:38:43.959 align:start position:0%
immensely because breeders purposefully
 
04:38:46.310 --> 04:38:46.320 align:start position:0%
select for unhealthy traits in an effort
 
04:38:49.269 --> 04:38:49.279 align:start position:0%
to make these animals more aesthetically
 
04:38:50.789 --> 04:38:50.799 align:start position:0%
pleasing to
 
04:38:55.590 --> 04:38:55.600 align:start position:0%
us these intentionally deformed animals
 
04:38:58.349 --> 04:38:58.359 align:start position:0%
are prone to Chronic respiratory issues
 
04:39:01.390 --> 04:39:01.400 align:start position:0%
due to their narrowed nostrils or uh
 
04:39:04.429 --> 04:39:04.439 align:start position:0%
distorted wind pipes uh and they also
 
04:39:06.349 --> 04:39:06.359 align:start position:0%
suffer from dental problems because
 
04:39:07.910 --> 04:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
their teeth are
 
04:39:09.869 --> 04:39:09.879 align:start position:0%
overcrowded because they're struggling
 
04:39:12.470 --> 04:39:12.480 align:start position:0%
to breathe they can't properly Thermo
 
04:39:14.830 --> 04:39:14.840 align:start position:0%
regulate which puts them a greater risk
 
04:39:17.869 --> 04:39:17.879 align:start position:0%
of heat stroke um and heat stress
 
04:39:20.429 --> 04:39:20.439 align:start position:0%
additionally their excessive wrinkles uh
 
04:39:22.750 --> 04:39:22.760 align:start position:0%
often lead to painful skin infections as
 
04:39:25.230 --> 04:39:25.240 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier uh the shape of their
 
04:39:27.789 --> 04:39:27.799 align:start position:0%
skulls that's what causes their eyes to
 
04:39:32.269 --> 04:39:32.279 align:start position:0%
bulge um that can lead to a flat-faced
 
04:39:35.390 --> 04:39:35.400 align:start position:0%
dog suffering from corneal ulcers and
 
04:39:38.990 --> 04:39:39.000 align:start position:0%
that's uh common at very high rates uh
 
04:39:40.310 --> 04:39:40.320 align:start position:0%
because of their narrow hips and
 
04:39:43.230 --> 04:39:43.240 align:start position:0%
unnaturally large heads Approximately
 
04:39:45.750 --> 04:39:45.760 align:start position:0%
80% of Bulldogs are bred using
 
04:39:48.628 --> 04:39:48.638 align:start position:0%
artificial insemination and delivered
 
04:39:48.638 --> 04:39:49.628 align:start position:0%
artificial insemination and delivered
via

04:39:49.628 --> 04:39:49.638 align:start position:0%
via
 
04:39:52.628 --> 04:39:52.638 align:start position:0%
C-sections uh we cannot allow people to
 
04:39:54.990 --> 04:39:55.000 align:start position:0%
continue breeding animals who we
 
04:39:57.270 --> 04:39:57.280 align:start position:0%
know uh could live in a state of
 
04:39:59.150 --> 04:39:59.160 align:start position:0%
constant pain and discomfort as they
 
04:40:01.990 --> 04:40:02.000 align:start position:0%
struggle to breathe and carry out other
 
04:40:05.510 --> 04:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
basic tasks um I would have to imagine
 
04:40:10.070 --> 04:40:10.080 align:start position:0%
everyone here uh has experience with an
 
04:40:12.430 --> 04:40:12.440 align:start position:0%
animal companion or has been around dogs
 
04:40:15.390 --> 04:40:15.400 align:start position:0%
and cats so uh I don't have to argue the
 
04:40:17.590 --> 04:40:17.600 align:start position:0%
point about how amazing these animals
 
04:40:21.948 --> 04:40:21.958 align:start position:0%
are um and our Animal Companions dogs
 
04:40:24.110 --> 04:40:24.120 align:start position:0%
and cats they have almost complete trust
 
04:40:24.120 --> 04:40:24.868 align:start position:0%
and cats they have almost complete trust
in

04:40:24.868 --> 04:40:24.878 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:40:28.830 --> 04:40:28.840 align:start position:0%
us uh we owe it to them to protect them
 
04:40:32.110 --> 04:40:32.120 align:start position:0%
from this exploitation and abuse uh we
 
04:40:33.910 --> 04:40:33.920 align:start position:0%
need to ban on these cruel breeding
 
04:40:35.470 --> 04:40:35.480 align:start position:0%
practices now
 
04:40:37.868 --> 04:40:37.878 align:start position:0%

effing New Hampshire thank you madam
 
04:41:27.830 --> 04:41:27.840 align:start position:0%
chairman and the environment and
 
04:41:31.270 --> 04:41:31.280 align:start position:0%
agricultural committee I um appreciate
 
04:41:33.230 --> 04:41:33.240 align:start position:0%
living in New Hampshire where citizens
 
04:41:35.270 --> 04:41:35.280 align:start position:0%
can have the opportunity such is this to
 
04:41:37.750 --> 04:41:37.760 align:start position:0%
voice opinions on the potential laws of
 
04:41:40.550 --> 04:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
the state um I was going to read the
 
04:41:42.788 --> 04:41:42.798 align:start position:0%
rest of my testimony but I'd like to
 
04:41:46.550 --> 04:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
I've passed out um letters from CFA and
 
04:41:49.070 --> 04:41:49.080 align:start position:0%
Tika they are the two
 
04:41:51.830 --> 04:41:51.840 align:start position:0%
largest cat Registries cat genetic
 
04:41:54.590 --> 04:41:54.600 align:start position:0%
Registries in the world and it talks
 
04:41:56.788 --> 04:41:56.798 align:start position:0%
about how um the standards are
 
04:41:59.590 --> 04:41:59.600 align:start position:0%
determined if you look on page three at
 
04:42:02.628 --> 04:42:02.638 align:start position:0%
the bottom of the Tikka letter it says
 
04:42:05.868 --> 04:42:05.878 align:start position:0%
and I'll read it Breaky saal refers only
 
04:42:07.830 --> 04:42:07.840 align:start position:0%
to the shape of the head and the ratio
 
04:42:10.270 --> 04:42:10.280 align:start position:0%
of the short length to longer distances
 
04:42:12.510 --> 04:42:12.520 align:start position:0%
of the head width it is just a
 
04:42:13.868 --> 04:42:13.878 align:start position:0%
description of the heads of certain
 
04:42:16.230 --> 04:42:16.240 align:start position:0%
breeds of animals and can appear both
 
04:42:18.910 --> 04:42:18.920 align:start position:0%

04:42:20.990 --> 04:42:21.000 align:start position:0%
result of normal variation in SC skull
 
04:42:24.030 --> 04:42:24.040 align:start position:0%

04:42:46.190 --> 04:42:46.200 align:start position:0%
standards actually penalize bite defects
 
04:42:48.628 --> 04:42:48.638 align:start position:0%
and inability to breathe breathing
 
04:42:50.270 --> 04:42:50.280 align:start position:0%
problems are checked by knowledgeable
 
04:42:52.470 --> 04:42:52.480 align:start position:0%
and experienced judges by
 
04:42:54.230 --> 04:42:54.240 align:start position:0%
characteristics like the size of the
 
04:42:56.270 --> 04:42:56.280 align:start position:0%
nostrils their weight and the position
 
04:42:58.910 --> 04:42:58.920 align:start position:0%
of the nose line not the Breaky saali
 
04:43:01.708 --> 04:43:01.718 align:start position:0%
itself so that's part of the purpose of
 
04:43:04.150 --> 04:43:04.160 align:start position:0%
why we have Cat shows is so that the
 
04:43:06.350 --> 04:43:06.360 align:start position:0%
judge can go over breeding stock and
 
04:43:09.708 --> 04:43:09.718 align:start position:0%
individuals at Cat shows um you can show
 
04:43:14.110 --> 04:43:14.120 align:start position:0%
a um a neutered pet which is probably
 
04:43:16.628 --> 04:43:16.638 align:start position:0%
produced by a breeder so you can also
 
04:43:18.948 --> 04:43:18.958 align:start position:0%
see animals that are not kept for
 
04:43:22.390 --> 04:43:22.400 align:start position:0%
breeding purposes and how they conform
 
04:43:24.470 --> 04:43:24.480 align:start position:0%
to the
 
04:43:24.480 --> 04:43:27.070 align:start position:0%
to the
standard

04:43:27.070 --> 04:43:27.080 align:start position:0%
standard
 
04:43:30.350 --> 04:43:30.360 align:start position:0%
um many braiders expend much time
 
04:43:32.510 --> 04:43:32.520 align:start position:0%
resources and funds to contribute to the
 
04:43:35.150 --> 04:43:35.160 align:start position:0%
research which will better the life of
 
04:43:37.150 --> 04:43:37.160 align:start position:0%
the breeding stock and progyny of their
 
04:43:40.310 --> 04:43:40.320 align:start position:0%
chosen breed the PKD test for Persians
 
04:43:43.390 --> 04:43:43.400 align:start position:0%
has greatly reduced the incidence of
 
04:43:46.350 --> 04:43:46.360 align:start position:0%
polycystic kidney disease in the Persian
 
04:43:49.750 --> 04:43:49.760 align:start position:0%
population parent cats that test C clear
 
04:43:52.230 --> 04:43:52.240 align:start position:0%
cannot reproduce off offspring that
 
04:43:53.590 --> 04:43:53.600 align:start position:0%
would be
 
04:43:56.310 --> 04:43:56.320 align:start position:0%
afflicted it is difficult to understand
 
04:43:59.030 --> 04:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
that what is the actual current problem
 
04:44:00.788 --> 04:44:00.798 align:start position:0%
that this bill is trying to address in
 
04:44:03.510 --> 04:44:03.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire the bill seems unspecific
 
04:44:05.628 --> 04:44:05.638 align:start position:0%
vague and open-ended while at the same
 
04:44:07.910 --> 04:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
time highly
 
04:44:10.830 --> 04:44:10.840 align:start position:0%
punitive um I do have a concern that the
 
04:44:13.190 --> 04:44:13.200 align:start position:0%
message that this bill sends is that
 
04:44:15.430 --> 04:44:15.440 align:start position:0%
there is zero tolerance in New Hampshire
 
04:44:18.190 --> 04:44:18.200 align:start position:0%
for disabled pets in general under house
 
04:44:20.750 --> 04:44:20.760 align:start position:0%
bill 1102 to transfer a disabled pet is
 
04:44:22.948 --> 04:44:22.958 align:start position:0%
an act of Cruelty for the person looking
 
04:44:25.628 --> 04:44:25.638 align:start position:0%
to transfer regardless of the condition
 
04:44:27.750 --> 04:44:27.760 align:start position:0%
of the pet or whether or not it can live
 
04:44:30.150 --> 04:44:30.160 align:start position:0%
comfortably in a New Hampshire home with
 
04:44:32.470 --> 04:44:32.480 align:start position:0%
Proper Care thank you so much for
 
04:44:35.150 --> 04:44:35.160 align:start position:0%

04:44:37.550 --> 04:44:37.560 align:start position:0%

afternoon um I call Robert

afternoon good to be here thank you
 
04:45:05.990 --> 04:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
chairman eron committee members um I'm
 
04:45:07.750 --> 04:45:07.760 align:start position:0%
Robert Miller Brentwood New Hampshire
 
04:45:10.708 --> 04:45:10.718 align:start position:0%
resident I'm a dog owner cat owner too
 
04:45:15.150 --> 04:45:15.160 align:start position:0%
um but dogs I train them breed them um
 
04:45:17.910 --> 04:45:17.920 align:start position:0%
and hunt them um I'm strongly opposed to
 
04:45:20.708 --> 04:45:20.718 align:start position:0%
HB 1102 um and I'm going to kind of take
 
04:45:23.670 --> 04:45:23.680 align:start position:0%
a little different route here um what
 
04:45:25.190 --> 04:45:25.200 align:start position:0%
really this is is nothing more than an
 
04:45:27.110 --> 04:45:27.120 align:start position:0%
attempt by animal rights activists to
 
04:45:29.910 --> 04:45:29.920 align:start position:0%
restrict our abilities and our our right
 
04:45:33.270 --> 04:45:33.280 align:start position:0%
to choose the animal that we want
 
04:45:33.280 --> 04:45:36.270 align:start position:0%
to choose the animal that we want
um

04:45:36.270 --> 04:45:36.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:45:37.990 --> 04:45:38.000 align:start position:0%
that's kind of just the hook
 
04:45:42.590 --> 04:45:42.600 align:start position:0%
that's being hung on the brais saali and
 
04:45:45.990 --> 04:45:46.000 align:start position:0%
cruelty and all that um as you you were
 
04:45:47.788 --> 04:45:47.798 align:start position:0%
told and as you're aware that um this is
 
04:45:49.948 --> 04:45:49.958 align:start position:0%
the first time this legislation has been
 
04:45:51.510 --> 04:45:51.520 align:start position:0%
introduced in any state in the United
 
04:45:54.550 --> 04:45:54.560 align:start position:0%
States um this is a test case and they
 
04:45:57.070 --> 04:45:57.080 align:start position:0%
will take the language and the comments
 
04:45:59.230 --> 04:45:59.240 align:start position:0%
that are made here and there and tweak
 
04:46:02.030 --> 04:46:02.040 align:start position:0%
it and it will show up elsewhere um
 
04:46:03.750 --> 04:46:03.760 align:start position:0%
that's just kind of how things go with
 
04:46:06.310 --> 04:46:06.320 align:start position:0%
um with these things um but do we really
 
04:46:09.230 --> 04:46:09.240 align:start position:0%
want New Hampshire to be the guinea pig
 
04:46:13.430 --> 04:46:13.440 align:start position:0%
for animal rights policy um I don't as a
 
04:46:17.150 --> 04:46:17.160 align:start position:0%
resident I'm kind of outraged by that um
 
04:46:20.948 --> 04:46:20.958 align:start position:0%
and you know how ridiculous to create a
 
04:46:24.948 --> 04:46:24.958 align:start position:0%
felony for breeding dogs or cats um as
 
04:46:26.708 --> 04:46:26.718 align:start position:0%
this bill would do the second offense
 
04:46:30.230 --> 04:46:30.240 align:start position:0%
becomes a felony um and I know we're
 
04:46:32.190 --> 04:46:32.200 align:start position:0%
going to hear from some veterinarians
 
04:46:35.830 --> 04:46:35.840 align:start position:0%
here in um an esteemed V from the United
 
04:46:38.030 --> 04:46:38.040 align:start position:0%
Kingdom but do we want
 
04:46:40.390 --> 04:46:40.400 align:start position:0%
to take our
 
04:46:43.548 --> 04:46:43.558 align:start position:0%
cues from 3,000 miles away on how we
 
04:46:45.590 --> 04:46:45.600 align:start position:0%
should set Animal Welfare policy in this
 
04:46:49.990 --> 04:46:50.000 align:start position:0%
state I don't I don't think so
 
04:46:52.230 --> 04:46:52.240 align:start position:0%
um I think it's a little arrogant and
 
04:46:54.350 --> 04:46:54.360 align:start position:0%
presumptuous that other jurisdictions
 
04:46:56.190 --> 04:46:56.200 align:start position:0%
that have done this um somehow are more
 
04:46:58.470 --> 04:46:58.480 align:start position:0%
enlightened than we are um I kind of
 
04:47:02.190 --> 04:47:02.200 align:start position:0%
find that offensive um and not to forget
 
04:47:04.830 --> 04:47:04.840 align:start position:0%
that the last time
 
04:47:08.070 --> 04:47:08.080 align:start position:0%
the British uh try to impo impose their
 
04:47:10.430 --> 04:47:10.440 align:start position:0%
their will on us we had a tea party in
 
04:47:13.670 --> 04:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
Boston Harbor and then a revolution um
 
04:47:16.350 --> 04:47:16.360 align:start position:0%
Live Free or Die um Freedom also means
 
04:47:19.310 --> 04:47:19.320 align:start position:0%
being able to choose the animal that you
 
04:47:22.390 --> 04:47:22.400 align:start position:0%
want thank you that's it any questions
 
04:47:25.470 --> 04:47:25.480 align:start position:0%
for representative ger thank you madam
 
04:47:26.470 --> 04:47:26.480 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
04:47:28.230 --> 04:47:28.240 align:start position:0%
question sure so I just wanted Devil's
 
04:47:31.310 --> 04:47:31.320 align:start position:0%
Advocate uh let's take the most extreme
 
04:47:34.948 --> 04:47:34.958 align:start position:0%
situation somebody has to two dogs which
 
04:47:38.590 --> 04:47:38.600 align:start position:0%
are clearly suffering from boas right
 
04:47:41.030 --> 04:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
but they are aesthetically pleasing to
 
04:47:44.070 --> 04:47:44.080 align:start position:0%
the breed they breed those two dogs
 
04:47:46.190 --> 04:47:46.200 align:start position:0%
because the result will be an aesthetic
 
04:47:47.708 --> 04:47:47.718 align:start position:0%
presumably an aesthetically pleasing
 
04:47:50.590 --> 04:47:50.600 align:start position:0%
animal that they can sell for
 
04:47:54.270 --> 04:47:54.280 align:start position:0%
profit is is this a case in your mind
 
04:47:56.150 --> 04:47:56.160 align:start position:0%
should any should we be able to do
 
04:47:59.310 --> 04:47:59.320 align:start position:0%
anything to prevent that worst case
 
04:48:01.708 --> 04:48:01.718 align:start position:0%
scenario perhaps we should but I don't
 
04:48:04.670 --> 04:48:04.680 align:start position:0%
believe this bill will do that okay
 
04:48:04.680 --> 04:48:05.390 align:start position:0%
believe this bill will do that okay
thank

04:48:05.390 --> 04:48:05.400 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:48:08.150 --> 04:48:08.160 align:start position:0%

04:48:11.390 --> 04:48:11.400 align:start position:0%
committee representative ktoa thank you
 
04:48:14.670 --> 04:48:14.680 align:start position:0%

have copies of your testimony I do thank
 
04:48:23.548 --> 04:48:23.558 align:start position:0%
you could pass him around Madam chair
 
04:48:25.590 --> 04:48:25.600 align:start position:0%
point of personal privilege the chair
 
04:48:27.150 --> 04:48:27.160 align:start position:0%
said at the beginning of the hearing
 
04:48:30.030 --> 04:48:30.040 align:start position:0%
that no one is on people's motives I can
 
04:48:32.310 --> 04:48:32.320 align:start position:0%
guarantee you and I have email evidence
 
04:48:35.190 --> 04:48:35.200 align:start position:0%
that I put this in of my bition with my
 
04:48:37.270 --> 04:48:37.280 align:start position:0%
own thought and I was not contacted by
 
04:48:39.070 --> 04:48:39.080 align:start position:0%
any animal rights organization until
 
04:48:41.788 --> 04:48:41.798 align:start position:0%
well after the the bill was introduced
 
04:48:44.350 --> 04:48:44.360 align:start position:0%
into the house so that was not gabbled
 
04:48:46.030 --> 04:48:46.040 align:start position:0%
out of order when this person who I've
 
04:48:48.548 --> 04:48:48.558 align:start position:0%
never met before said that I made a
 
04:48:50.830 --> 04:48:50.840 align:start position:0%
presumption that I had put in a bill
 
04:48:54.070 --> 04:48:54.080 align:start position:0%
because the organization I I don't
 
04:48:56.270 --> 04:48:56.280 align:start position:0%
believe he mentioned your name or the
 
04:48:58.310 --> 04:48:58.320 align:start position:0%
sponsor Prime spor and he said that I
 
04:48:59.548 --> 04:48:59.558 align:start position:0%
put it in because of animal
 
04:49:02.830 --> 04:49:02.840 align:start position:0%
organizations that is not all right
 
04:49:04.750 --> 04:49:04.760 align:start position:0%
Point well taken thank
 
04:49:08.830 --> 04:49:08.840 align:start position:0%

with you all this afternoon I also want
 
04:49:45.830 --> 04:49:45.840 align:start position:0%
to take a moment and publicly thank the
 
04:49:48.788 --> 04:49:48.798 align:start position:0%
dog breeders and dog lovers behind me
 
04:49:52.030 --> 04:49:52.040 align:start position:0%
who have taken time from work um family
 
04:49:53.750 --> 04:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
obligations and other commitments to be
 
04:49:56.070 --> 04:49:56.080 align:start position:0%
here this afternoon to be certain that
 
04:49:59.708 --> 04:49:59.718 align:start position:0%
you all have accurate information and a
 
04:50:02.788 --> 04:50:02.798 align:start position:0%
resource to ask these questions of those
 
04:50:04.430 --> 04:50:04.440 align:start position:0%
who are breeding dogs
 
04:50:07.150 --> 04:50:07.160 align:start position:0%
I do want to note that I take exception
 
04:50:09.628 --> 04:50:09.638 align:start position:0%
to statements that have been made that
 
04:50:12.150 --> 04:50:12.160 align:start position:0%
breed Registries are encouraging and
 
04:50:14.590 --> 04:50:14.600 align:start position:0%
breeders are chasing extreme
 
04:50:17.070 --> 04:50:17.080 align:start position:0%
confirmation that is a
 
04:50:18.750 --> 04:50:18.760 align:start position:0%
mischaracterization of the American
 
04:50:20.310 --> 04:50:20.320 align:start position:0%
Kennel Club so I want to take a moment
 
04:50:22.990 --> 04:50:23.000 align:start position:0%
to do a little bit of a dive on who is
 
04:50:26.070 --> 04:50:26.080 align:start position:0%
the American Kennel Club what do we do
 
04:50:28.990 --> 04:50:29.000 align:start position:0%
and whether or not um New Hampshire has
 
04:50:31.548 --> 04:50:31.558 align:start position:0%
a problem with pet related
 
04:50:35.150 --> 04:50:35.160 align:start position:0%
suffering um I have shared for instance
 
04:50:38.310 --> 04:50:38.320 align:start position:0%
with you all uh I had asked the parent
 
04:50:41.788 --> 04:50:41.798 align:start position:0%
clubs of some of the brachy calic breeds
 
04:50:44.070 --> 04:50:44.080 align:start position:0%
to in fact submit a statement to the
 
04:50:46.150 --> 04:50:46.160 align:start position:0%
committee to help educate the committee
 
04:50:49.628 --> 04:50:49.638 align:start position:0%
about their breed standard and um it's
 
04:50:53.070 --> 04:50:53.080 align:start position:0%
really the Bible that they use in order
 
04:50:55.590 --> 04:50:55.600 align:start position:0%
to ensure that their breeding programs
 
04:50:58.510 --> 04:50:58.520 align:start position:0%
are being undertaken responsibly for the
 
04:51:00.510 --> 04:51:00.520 align:start position:0%
purpose of not only preserving breed
 
04:51:02.868 --> 04:51:02.878 align:start position:0%
characteristics and producing healthy
 
04:51:05.948 --> 04:51:05.958 align:start position:0%
Wells socialized purebred puppies but
 
04:51:07.910 --> 04:51:07.920 align:start position:0%
our Affiliated clubs I've know I've
 
04:51:10.030 --> 04:51:10.040 align:start position:0%
shared with you that AKC is a club of
 
04:51:13.190 --> 04:51:13.200 align:start position:0%
clubs and we have more than 200
 
04:51:16.230 --> 04:51:16.240 align:start position:0%
Affiliated parent clubs that are
 
04:51:18.230 --> 04:51:18.240 align:start position:0%
responsible for the individual
 
04:51:20.590 --> 04:51:20.600 align:start position:0%
recognized breeds uh so the second
 
04:51:22.190 --> 04:51:22.200 align:start position:0%
handout that's going
 
04:51:25.868 --> 04:51:25.878 align:start position:0%
around is a um public education tool
 
04:51:28.390 --> 04:51:28.400 align:start position:0%
that we use to help the public
 
04:51:30.070 --> 04:51:30.080 align:start position:0%
understand more about the breeds when
 
04:51:32.910 --> 04:51:32.920 align:start position:0%
you open it up it has all the recognized
 
04:51:35.670 --> 04:51:35.680 align:start position:0%
AKC breed as the centerfold so it's one
 
04:51:38.110 --> 04:51:38.120 align:start position:0%
example of the public education um that
 
04:51:40.910 --> 04:51:40.920 align:start position:0%
we engage in um to ensure that the
 
04:51:42.430 --> 04:51:42.440 align:start position:0%
public has the right information and
 
04:51:45.350 --> 04:51:45.360 align:start position:0%
choosing the right pet for them the
 
04:51:46.868 --> 04:51:46.878 align:start position:0%
parent clubs actually develop and
 
04:51:49.230 --> 04:51:49.240 align:start position:0%
approve the preds official standard
 
04:51:51.390 --> 04:51:51.400 align:start position:0%
which is a written description of the
 
04:51:53.990 --> 04:51:54.000 align:start position:0%
ideal specimen of their Breed by
 
04:51:56.270 --> 04:51:56.280 align:start position:0%
describing its structure temperament and
 
04:51:59.350 --> 04:51:59.360 align:start position:0%
instincts on rare occasion the club may
 
04:52:01.788 --> 04:52:01.798 align:start position:0%
make revisions so I wanted to for the
 
04:52:04.150 --> 04:52:04.160 align:start position:0%
record clarify that in fact
 
04:52:07.230 --> 04:52:07.240 align:start position:0%
breed parent clubs it's not the breed
 
04:52:10.190 --> 04:52:10.200 align:start position:0%
registry AKC is the largest purebred dog
 
04:52:13.110 --> 04:52:13.120 align:start position:0%
registry that maintains a registry but
 
04:52:15.110 --> 04:52:15.120 align:start position:0%
it is the parent club that owns the
 
04:52:17.670 --> 04:52:17.680 align:start position:0%
standard for their breed and it is rare
 
04:52:19.868 --> 04:52:19.878 align:start position:0%
that they will change the standard in
 
04:52:22.190 --> 04:52:22.200 align:start position:0%
the packet that I uh distributed to you
 
04:52:24.270 --> 04:52:24.280 align:start position:0%
all for instance I'd really appreciate
 
04:52:27.150 --> 04:52:27.160 align:start position:0%
you turning to halfway through is a
 
04:52:28.750 --> 04:52:28.760 align:start position:0%
statement from the Bulldog Club of
 
04:52:30.750 --> 04:52:30.760 align:start position:0%
America for instance and they have
 
04:52:32.990 --> 04:52:33.000 align:start position:0%
provided the committee with an update
 
04:52:35.390 --> 04:52:35.400 align:start position:0%
with regard to their standard was
 
04:52:37.390 --> 04:52:37.400 align:start position:0%
adopted in
 
04:52:42.150 --> 04:52:42.160 align:start position:0%
1896 they it was amended in
 
04:52:47.510 --> 04:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
1976 in 1990 reformatted to conform uh
 
04:52:49.230 --> 04:52:49.240 align:start position:0%
description of the gate was moved from
 
04:52:51.270 --> 04:52:51.280 align:start position:0%
the beginning to the end so a technical
 
04:52:54.830 --> 04:52:54.840 align:start position:0%
change and in 2016 it was amended eight
 
04:52:57.868 --> 04:52:57.878 align:start position:0%
years ago to add a disqualification for
 
04:53:00.628 --> 04:53:00.638 align:start position:0%
certain um colors and what we know is
 
04:53:02.310 --> 04:53:02.320 align:start position:0%
that certain colors or genetic
 
04:53:05.350 --> 04:53:05.360 align:start position:0%
introduction into Purebread bulldogs for
 
04:53:09.628 --> 04:53:09.638 align:start position:0%
example can introduce health problems um
 
04:53:11.868 --> 04:53:11.878 align:start position:0%
for instance the meral color can
 
04:53:14.190 --> 04:53:14.200 align:start position:0%
contribute to deafness for instance so
 
04:53:15.590 --> 04:53:15.600 align:start position:0%
that would be the reason it would be a
 
04:53:18.150 --> 04:53:18.160 align:start position:0%
health rated reason as to why the parent
 
04:53:19.948 --> 04:53:19.958 align:start position:0%
club would actually make a change to
 
04:53:21.310 --> 04:53:21.320 align:start position:0%
their breed
 
04:53:23.868 --> 04:53:23.878 align:start position:0%
standard AKC strongly opposes the
 
04:53:26.110 --> 04:53:26.120 align:start position:0%
breeding of dogs by those who would do
 
04:53:28.230 --> 04:53:28.240 align:start position:0%
so without regard for the animals
 
04:53:30.548 --> 04:53:30.558 align:start position:0%
welfare and I wanted to mention all of
 
04:53:32.990 --> 04:53:33.000 align:start position:0%
the things that AKC does to stand up for
 
04:53:36.390 --> 04:53:36.400 align:start position:0%
dogs we have an online Canan College to
 
04:53:37.868 --> 04:53:37.878 align:start position:0%
teach responsible breeding with
 
04:53:40.310 --> 04:53:40.320 align:start position:0%
practical step-by-step approaches by
 
04:53:42.470 --> 04:53:42.480 align:start position:0%
joining one of our clubs breeders learn
 
04:53:44.628 --> 04:53:44.638 align:start position:0%
about the Health and Welfare topics and
 
04:53:46.470 --> 04:53:46.480 align:start position:0%
they get mentored and share experience
 
04:53:49.670 --> 04:53:49.680 align:start position:0%
by others in the breed the K9 Health
 
04:53:52.670 --> 04:53:52.680 align:start position:0%
Foundation is funded by our clubs and
 
04:53:55.708 --> 04:53:55.718 align:start position:0%
has uh provided more than 68 million in
 
04:53:57.990 --> 04:53:58.000 align:start position:0%
can9 health research that benefits all
 
04:54:01.190 --> 04:54:01.200 align:start position:0%
dogs and we applaud the efforts of all
 
04:54:02.788 --> 04:54:02.798 align:start position:0%
the scientists and veterinarians who
 
04:54:04.708 --> 04:54:04.718 align:start position:0%
continue to work to Advanced can9 Health
 
04:54:07.230 --> 04:54:07.240 align:start position:0%
research and education this is a
 
04:54:10.830 --> 04:54:10.840 align:start position:0%
developmental process and uh Improvement
 
04:54:13.670 --> 04:54:13.680 align:start position:0%
and progress but never is there
 
04:54:16.548 --> 04:54:16.558 align:start position:0%
Perfection I will acknowledge that um we
 
04:54:18.910 --> 04:54:18.920 align:start position:0%
also have a breeder of Merit program
 
04:54:21.030 --> 04:54:21.040 align:start position:0%
that recognizes breeders who certify
 
04:54:22.830 --> 04:54:22.840 align:start position:0%
that their breeding stock has been
 
04:54:24.470 --> 04:54:24.480 align:start position:0%
tested in accordance with the parent
 
04:54:27.070 --> 04:54:27.080 align:start position:0%
club's guidelines we support future
 
04:54:29.548 --> 04:54:29.558 align:start position:0%
veterinarian study in the oenology which
 
04:54:31.150 --> 04:54:31.160 align:start position:0%
is the branch of veterinary medicine
 
04:54:33.830 --> 04:54:33.840 align:start position:0%
concerned with obstetrics physiology and
 
04:54:36.310 --> 04:54:36.320 align:start position:0%
diseases of animal reproductive systems
 
04:54:39.510 --> 04:54:39.520 align:start position:0%
why is that in my testimony you'll see
 
04:54:42.548 --> 04:54:42.558 align:start position:0%
that it is rare that a uh School of
 
04:54:45.470 --> 04:54:45.480 align:start position:0%
veterinary medicine actually includes
 
04:54:48.070 --> 04:54:48.080 align:start position:0%
and requires the study of small animal
 
04:54:49.670 --> 04:54:49.680 align:start position:0%
theog genology
 
04:54:52.390 --> 04:54:52.400 align:start position:0%
um last in terms of what the scope of
 
04:54:54.868 --> 04:54:54.878 align:start position:0%
the problem is I have submitted to the
 
04:54:57.150 --> 04:54:57.160 align:start position:0%
committee I did a public information
 
04:54:58.670 --> 04:54:58.680 align:start position:0%
request with the New Hampshire Attorney
 
04:55:01.628 --> 04:55:01.638 align:start position:0%
General's office and asked for all of
 
04:55:03.868 --> 04:55:03.878 align:start position:0%
the pet related complaints over the last
 
04:55:06.670 --> 04:55:06.680 align:start position:0%
three years and I've given a brief uh
 
04:55:09.430 --> 04:55:09.440 align:start position:0%
summary of the results there were four
 
04:55:13.110 --> 04:55:13.120 align:start position:0%
online scams from January 1st 2021 to
 
04:55:14.670 --> 04:55:14.680 align:start position:0%
January 1st
 
04:55:18.070 --> 04:55:18.080 align:start position:0%
2024 those were infectious disease or
 
04:55:20.830 --> 04:55:20.840 align:start position:0%
individuals who made payments online and
 
04:55:24.150 --> 04:55:24.160 align:start position:0%
never received a pet one cat breeder I
 
04:55:29.150 --> 04:55:29.160 align:start position:0%
think um your your time is is over
 
04:55:33.548 --> 04:55:33.558 align:start position:0%
um I uh I want to know if there's any uh
 
04:55:35.150 --> 04:55:35.160 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
04:55:35.160 --> 04:55:38.910 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
representative

04:55:38.910 --> 04:55:38.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:41.590 --> 04:55:41.600 align:start position:0%
Penza can I have her finish that because
 
04:55:43.948 --> 04:55:43.958 align:start position:0%
I think it's the you only have a couple
 
04:55:46.390 --> 04:55:46.400 align:start position:0%
more just summarizing I just want to
 
04:55:49.230 --> 04:55:49.240 align:start position:0%
hear what statistics yes just okay sure
 
04:55:51.190 --> 04:55:51.200 align:start position:0%
would you uh please thank you for the
 
04:55:53.150 --> 04:55:53.160 align:start position:0%
question representative let us know that
 
04:55:54.990 --> 04:55:55.000 align:start position:0%
yes and I'll just be brief U there were
 
04:55:57.150 --> 04:55:57.160 align:start position:0%
four online scams I know we've talked
 
04:55:58.910 --> 04:55:58.920 align:start position:0%
about that in this committee before
 
04:56:01.510 --> 04:56:01.520 align:start position:0%
there was one New Hampshire cat breeder
 
04:56:03.868 --> 04:56:03.878 align:start position:0%
that uh sold a maincoon cat
 
04:56:06.070 --> 04:56:06.080 align:start position:0%
that was diagnosed with a viral
 
04:56:08.548 --> 04:56:08.558 align:start position:0%
infection and they got a replacement
 
04:56:11.910 --> 04:56:11.920 align:start position:0%
animal um that also be had an infectious
 
04:56:14.510 --> 04:56:14.520 align:start position:0%
disease uh there are four complaints get
 
04:56:16.150 --> 04:56:16.160 align:start position:0%
against New Hampshire pet stores and
 
04:56:18.510 --> 04:56:18.520 align:start position:0%
there was one New Hampshire dog breeder
 
04:56:21.150 --> 04:56:21.160 align:start position:0%
uh individual bought two French Bulldogs
 
04:56:22.628 --> 04:56:22.638 align:start position:0%
the complaint said the seller was
 
04:56:24.510 --> 04:56:24.520 align:start position:0%
without a New Hampshire license and had
 
04:56:26.350 --> 04:56:26.360 align:start position:0%
a criminal record and one of the dogs
 
04:56:28.030 --> 04:56:28.040 align:start position:0%
was diagnosed with a congenital heart
 
04:56:29.510 --> 04:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
condition so I wanted the committee to
 
04:56:31.270 --> 04:56:31.280 align:start position:0%
know that of all the data from the New
 
04:56:32.830 --> 04:56:32.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Attorney General's office the
 
04:56:34.948 --> 04:56:34.958 align:start position:0%
department of Justice on consumer
 
04:56:37.948 --> 04:56:37.958 align:start position:0%
protection those were the um all of the
 
04:56:40.270 --> 04:56:40.280 align:start position:0%
complaints that had been submitted under
 
04:56:42.150 --> 04:56:42.160 align:start position:0%
the Consumer Protection Law here in New
 
04:56:43.830 --> 04:56:43.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire none of them refer to
 
04:56:47.030 --> 04:56:47.040 align:start position:0%
respiratory suffering or um ailments
 
04:56:48.788 --> 04:56:48.798 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire uh so I hope
 
04:56:50.948 --> 04:56:50.958 align:start position:0%
that's helpful to the committee so so
 
04:56:56.110 --> 04:56:56.120 align:start position:0%
what you're saying is that um there has
 
04:56:58.948 --> 04:56:58.958 align:start position:0%
not been anybody who's bought a Frenchie
 
04:57:05.070 --> 04:57:05.080 align:start position:0%
or Shih Tzu or um a boxer that has had
 
04:57:08.628 --> 04:57:08.638 align:start position:0%
uh any kind of problems as a result of
 
04:57:11.868 --> 04:57:11.878 align:start position:0%
uh of its breed or breeder that has made
 
04:57:13.628 --> 04:57:13.638 align:start position:0%
a complaint to the New Hampshire
 
04:57:16.350 --> 04:57:16.360 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office just the one
 
04:57:20.470 --> 04:57:20.480 align:start position:0%
that I mentioned um you know because you
 
04:57:22.310 --> 04:57:22.320 align:start position:0%
heard earlier that lot people spend a
 
04:57:24.628 --> 04:57:24.638 align:start position:0%
lot of money on pets these days if there
 
04:57:27.830 --> 04:57:27.840 align:start position:0%
had been issues I think it's likely that
 
04:57:30.230 --> 04:57:30.240 align:start position:0%
people would pursue action through the
 
04:57:31.948 --> 04:57:31.958 align:start position:0%
consumer under the consumer protection
 
04:57:34.510 --> 04:57:34.520 align:start position:0%
laws which is why I requested the data
 
04:57:36.150 --> 04:57:36.160 align:start position:0%
I've heard the committee often ask if
 
04:57:38.150 --> 04:57:38.160 align:start position:0%
anyone has the data on a particular
 
04:57:39.750 --> 04:57:39.760 align:start position:0%
problem that a bill is trying to solve
 
04:57:41.510 --> 04:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
so I I did submit a freedom of
 
04:57:41.520 --> 04:57:42.708 align:start position:0%
so I I did submit a freedom of
information

04:57:42.708 --> 04:57:42.718 align:start position:0%
information
 
04:57:45.270 --> 04:57:45.280 align:start position:0%
request okay so you're suggesting that
 
04:57:48.750 --> 04:57:48.760 align:start position:0%
there is no problem with this kind of
 
04:57:52.310 --> 04:57:52.320 align:start position:0%
breeding uh going on in New Hampshire
 
04:57:53.750 --> 04:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
I'm saying the data from the Attorney
 
04:57:55.070 --> 04:57:55.080 align:start position:0%
General's office suggests that there is
 
04:57:58.990 --> 04:57:59.000 align:start position:0%
not correction okay any other representa
 
04:58:01.070 --> 04:58:01.080 align:start position:0%
kraton thank you madam chair and thank
 
04:58:03.190 --> 04:58:03.200 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony and I I
 
04:58:05.868 --> 04:58:05.878 align:start position:0%
appreciate you consolidating all of your
 
04:58:09.548 --> 04:58:09.558 align:start position:0%
sub club's information and input I
 
04:58:13.470 --> 04:58:13.480 align:start position:0%
haven't read it uh in your knowledge in
 
04:58:16.990 --> 04:58:17.000 align:start position:0%
these standards by all of your sub 200
 
04:58:17.000 --> 04:58:17.830 align:start position:0%
these standards by all of your sub 200
sub

04:58:17.830 --> 04:58:17.840 align:start position:0%
sub
 
04:58:20.910 --> 04:58:20.920 align:start position:0%
clubs uh is there anything
 
04:58:24.590 --> 04:58:24.600 align:start position:0%
prohibiting the the breeding of animals
 
04:58:29.110 --> 04:58:29.120 align:start position:0%
that are suffering in in some way all of
 
04:58:31.948 --> 04:58:31.958 align:start position:0%
these clubs have ethical requirements to
 
04:58:35.310 --> 04:58:35.320 align:start position:0%
be a member of the club so yes and let's
 
04:58:39.310 --> 04:58:39.320 align:start position:0%
not forget the uh members of these clubs
 
04:58:40.390 --> 04:58:40.400 align:start position:0%
you know I'd like to say that
 
04:58:43.110 --> 04:58:43.120 align:start position:0%
veterinarians have knowledge about
 
04:58:45.910 --> 04:58:45.920 align:start position:0%
animals that is a mile wide the members
 
04:58:47.548 --> 04:58:47.558 align:start position:0%
of these parent clubs have knowledge
 
04:58:49.270 --> 04:58:49.280 align:start position:0%
about their particular breed that is a
 
04:58:51.310 --> 04:58:51.320 align:start position:0%
mile deep in terms of the genetics
 
04:58:53.788 --> 04:58:53.798 align:start position:0%
they're studying pedigrees um they're
 
04:58:55.310 --> 04:58:55.320 align:start position:0%
funding the genetic research that you
 
04:58:57.110 --> 04:58:57.120 align:start position:0%
heard earlier to ensure that they can
 
04:58:58.868 --> 04:58:58.878 align:start position:0%
improve upon the breed they are
 
04:59:00.910 --> 04:59:00.920 align:start position:0%
preservation breeders they have invested
 
04:59:05.750 --> 04:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
their time money commitment passion um
 
04:59:07.670 --> 04:59:07.680 align:start position:0%
in producing healthy dogs that that's
 
04:59:09.590 --> 04:59:09.600 align:start position:0%
who these parent club members are so I
 
04:59:10.868 --> 04:59:10.878 align:start position:0%
appreciate the opportunity to correct
 
04:59:13.230 --> 04:59:13.240 align:start position:0%
the record in that regard okay thank you
 
04:59:13.240 --> 04:59:14.350 align:start position:0%
the record in that regard okay thank you
representative

04:59:14.350 --> 04:59:14.360 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:59:17.350 --> 04:59:17.360 align:start position:0%
Penza so kind of piggybacking on what
 
04:59:21.708 --> 04:59:21.718 align:start position:0%
representative kraton said um based upon
 
04:59:25.030 --> 04:59:25.040 align:start position:0%
the all the Breeders that you have um
 
04:59:27.110 --> 04:59:27.120 align:start position:0%
would you you said in the in your
 
04:59:29.750 --> 04:59:29.760 align:start position:0%
testimony that there's a certain
 
04:59:31.750 --> 04:59:31.760 align:start position:0%
character it would be like color that
 
04:59:35.830 --> 04:59:35.840 align:start position:0%
would show if if it's deviating from the
 
04:59:39.430 --> 04:59:39.440 align:start position:0%
breed that would then impact other
 
04:59:41.390 --> 04:59:41.400 align:start position:0%
health explain that because you're
 
04:59:43.750 --> 04:59:43.760 align:start position:0%
saying just literally like a marking
 
04:59:45.750 --> 04:59:45.760 align:start position:0%
could show that okay well that could
 
04:59:47.628 --> 04:59:47.638 align:start position:0%
then cause other different types of
 
04:59:49.868 --> 04:59:49.878 align:start position:0%
deformity sure in the packet for
 
04:59:51.270 --> 04:59:51.280 align:start position:0%
instance probably at the end because I
 
04:59:53.628 --> 04:59:53.638 align:start position:0%
believe they're alphabetical um the
 
04:59:55.750 --> 04:59:55.760 align:start position:0%
panes Club of America for instance that
 
04:59:57.310 --> 04:59:57.320 align:start position:0%
breed has been around for a thousand
 
04:59:59.150 --> 04:59:59.160 align:start position:0%
years and they're communicating to the
 
05:00:00.310 --> 05:00:00.320 align:start position:0%
committee when I reviewed their
 
05:00:02.628 --> 05:00:02.638 align:start position:0%
statement that at this point they don't
 
05:00:04.390 --> 05:00:04.400 align:start position:0%
they have one of the healthiest breeds
 
05:00:06.830 --> 05:00:06.840 align:start position:0%
because um they have not introduced
 
05:00:09.548 --> 05:00:09.558 align:start position:0%
other breeds or factors into the
 
05:00:12.070 --> 05:00:12.080 align:start position:0%
pedigree and therefore they have over
 
05:00:14.670 --> 05:00:14.680 align:start position:0%
time been able to eliminate health
 
05:00:19.190 --> 05:00:19.200 align:start position:0%
issues altogether so there can be bad
 
05:00:23.110 --> 05:00:23.120 align:start position:0%
actors who will promote publicly for
 
05:00:25.948 --> 05:00:25.958 align:start position:0%
instance um and it would be I think a
 
05:00:29.150 --> 05:00:29.160 align:start position:0%
buyer beware sign if you saw someone
 
05:00:33.470 --> 05:00:33.480 align:start position:0%
that was marketing rare or exotic color
 
05:00:37.628 --> 05:00:37.638 align:start position:0%
Bulldog um or a designer breed typically
 
05:00:40.190 --> 05:00:40.200 align:start position:0%
that means this is someone that is not
 
05:00:43.990 --> 05:00:44.000 align:start position:0%
breeding to the standard they are uh
 
05:00:46.548 --> 05:00:46.558 align:start position:0%
selling you know uh basically something
 
05:00:48.708 --> 05:00:48.718 align:start position:0%
that is not a pure bread but they're
 
05:00:50.628 --> 05:00:50.638 align:start position:0%
hoping to get additional money by virtue
 
05:00:53.628 --> 05:00:53.638 align:start position:0%
of calling it exotic or rare colored or
 
05:00:55.670 --> 05:00:55.680 align:start position:0%
or things of this nature and that's
 
05:00:57.350 --> 05:00:57.360 align:start position:0%
essentially what they've done is created
 
05:01:00.750 --> 05:01:00.760 align:start position:0%
a mixed breed dog um and so you know
 
05:01:02.430 --> 05:01:02.440 align:start position:0%
even when you look for instance at the
 
05:01:04.390 --> 05:01:04.400 align:start position:0%
bulldog Club of America they've provided
 
05:01:06.470 --> 05:01:06.480 align:start position:0%
for you two pictures one of what
 
05:01:08.788 --> 05:01:08.798 align:start position:0%
Bulldogs looked like um back in the
 
05:01:12.030 --> 05:01:12.040 align:start position:0%
1800s and what they look like today in
 
05:01:13.510 --> 05:01:13.520 align:start position:0%
confirmation with the breed standard of
 
05:01:14.990 --> 05:01:15.000 align:start position:0%
the Bulldog Club of America so they
 
05:01:16.670 --> 05:01:16.680 align:start position:0%
they've provided pictures with you for
 
05:01:18.390 --> 05:01:18.400 align:start position:0%
you as well as to what a bulldog looks
 
05:01:20.750 --> 05:01:20.760 align:start position:0%
like follow up
 
05:01:24.750 --> 05:01:24.760 align:start position:0%
followup so um these you know let's say
 
05:01:27.150 --> 05:01:27.160 align:start position:0%
Bad actors that are designer the things
 
05:01:29.390 --> 05:01:29.400 align:start position:0%
that you just said would not be
 
05:01:32.548 --> 05:01:32.558 align:start position:0%
incorporated into your Association
 
05:01:36.150 --> 05:01:36.160 align:start position:0%
correct cor that's correct they likely
 
05:01:37.788 --> 05:01:37.798 align:start position:0%
licensed at they if they're following
 
05:01:39.708 --> 05:01:39.718 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire laws because you have to
 
05:01:41.510 --> 05:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
have a health certificate to transfer an
 
05:01:45.030 --> 05:01:45.040 align:start position:0%
animal and whatnot um but there's fraud
 
05:01:46.548 --> 05:01:46.558 align:start position:0%
out there as there is in other
 
05:01:48.990 --> 05:01:49.000 align:start position:0%
Industries so I'm just acknowledging
 
05:01:53.150 --> 05:01:53.160 align:start position:0%
that um as an a thing that exists so
 
05:01:54.628 --> 05:01:54.638 align:start position:0%
would you say that the position of your
 
05:01:56.070 --> 05:01:56.080 align:start position:0%
organization because I think the most
 
05:01:57.868 --> 05:01:57.878 align:start position:0%
compelling thing out of the testimony
 
05:02:00.788 --> 05:02:00.798 align:start position:0%
from the sponsor is this picture in the
 
05:02:04.750 --> 05:02:04.760 align:start position:0%
back here about um you know you have one
 
05:02:06.430 --> 05:02:06.440 align:start position:0%
picture of the dog that's literally got
 
05:02:09.910 --> 05:02:09.920 align:start position:0%
no face and then one that has like would
 
05:02:12.670 --> 05:02:12.680 align:start position:0%
you say that um the position of your
 
05:02:17.310 --> 05:02:17.320 align:start position:0%
organization is to not be cutting things
 
05:02:19.708 --> 05:02:19.718 align:start position:0%
short in that would would you say that
 
05:02:23.708 --> 05:02:23.718 align:start position:0%
you guys are are going towards more of
 
05:02:26.390 --> 05:02:26.400 align:start position:0%
what things look like maybe you know 50
 
05:02:28.230 --> 05:02:28.240 align:start position:0%
years ago what I'm trying to say is that
 
05:02:30.510 --> 05:02:30.520 align:start position:0%
the breed standards have not recently
 
05:02:33.628 --> 05:02:33.638 align:start position:0%
changed to accommodate cuteness or
 
05:02:36.510 --> 05:02:36.520 align:start position:0%
appearance we have been committed and
 
05:02:39.990 --> 05:02:40.000 align:start position:0%
invested in uh preserving these breeds
 
05:02:42.868 --> 05:02:42.878 align:start position:0%
for generations and ensuring their
 
05:02:45.390 --> 05:02:45.400 align:start position:0%
health by funding the research and and
 
05:02:47.628 --> 05:02:47.638 align:start position:0%
all the rest so I haven't been privy to
 
05:02:49.548 --> 05:02:49.558 align:start position:0%
the picture that you've been shown but I
 
05:02:51.628 --> 05:02:51.638 align:start position:0%
am encouraging you to look at the
 
05:02:53.628 --> 05:02:53.638 align:start position:0%
Bulldog Club of America's pictures
 
05:02:56.430 --> 05:02:56.440 align:start position:0%
because earlier the statement was made
 
05:02:58.670 --> 05:02:58.680 align:start position:0%
that for instance Bulldogs now have
 
05:03:00.910 --> 05:03:00.920 align:start position:0%
shorter legs or whatnot so I'm I'm just
 
05:03:02.708 --> 05:03:02.718 align:start position:0%
acknowledging there are pictures there
 
05:03:04.548 --> 05:03:04.558 align:start position:0%
for you from Bulldogs a 100 years ago
 
05:03:05.910 --> 05:03:05.920 align:start position:0%
and what they look like
 
05:03:08.788 --> 05:03:08.798 align:start position:0%
today okay yeah thank
 
05:03:10.990 --> 05:03:11.000 align:start position:0%
you any other questions from the
 
05:03:13.150 --> 05:03:13.160 align:start position:0%
committee of Representative Howard thank
 
05:03:14.470 --> 05:03:14.480 align:start position:0%
you madam chair just a quick follow up
 
05:03:18.910 --> 05:03:18.920 align:start position:0%
on representative sure go ahead um so um
 
05:03:20.830 --> 05:03:20.840 align:start position:0%
I'll describe this to you so so this
 
05:03:22.708 --> 05:03:22.718 align:start position:0%
this dog on the left has a very flat
 
05:03:25.230 --> 05:03:25.240 align:start position:0%
face this one has a a very prominent
 
05:03:28.670 --> 05:03:28.680 align:start position:0%
muzzle um does that mean that one of
 
05:03:31.150 --> 05:03:31.160 align:start position:0%
these would be rejected from your club
 
05:03:32.708 --> 05:03:32.718 align:start position:0%
because it because it doesn't match the
 
05:03:35.030 --> 05:03:35.040 align:start position:0%
picture in the blue flyer that you sent
 
05:03:38.548 --> 05:03:38.558 align:start position:0%
us what a judge is doing is
 
05:03:42.390 --> 05:03:42.400 align:start position:0%
evaluating those dogs in the ring and
 
05:03:45.948 --> 05:03:45.958 align:start position:0%
how closely they conform to the ideal
 
05:03:49.750 --> 05:03:49.760 align:start position:0%
standard that is described in the parent
 
05:03:52.270 --> 05:03:52.280 align:start position:0%
breed club's standard description I
 
05:03:54.548 --> 05:03:54.558 align:start position:0%
think you would be hardpressed to find a
 
05:03:57.310 --> 05:03:57.320 align:start position:0%
standard that says that it should have a
 
05:03:59.990 --> 05:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
flattened nose or recently changed to
 
05:04:03.150 --> 05:04:03.160 align:start position:0%
say these extreme charact appearan are
 
05:04:05.430 --> 05:04:05.440 align:start position:0%
what's being sought I think that's a
 
05:04:07.548 --> 05:04:07.558 align:start position:0%
mischaracterization and misinforms the
 
05:04:09.590 --> 05:04:09.600 align:start position:0%
kitty the committee in making that type
 
05:04:09.600 --> 05:04:12.310 align:start position:0%
kitty the committee in making that type
of

05:04:12.310 --> 05:04:12.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:14.310 --> 05:04:14.320 align:start position:0%
statement there are different lengths of
 
05:04:17.150 --> 05:04:17.160 align:start position:0%
muzzle within one breed as well I think
 
05:04:20.110 --> 05:04:20.120 align:start position:0%
that's to be acknowledged uh for sure
 
05:04:22.750 --> 05:04:22.760 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby yeah do you have
 
05:04:25.910 --> 05:04:25.920 align:start position:0%
any any familiarity with uh the
 
05:04:28.390 --> 05:04:28.400 align:start position:0%
procedures for cruelty investigations in
 
05:04:28.400 --> 05:04:29.190 align:start position:0%
procedures for cruelty investigations in
New

05:04:29.190 --> 05:04:29.200 align:start position:0%
New
 
05:04:31.708 --> 05:04:31.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I know someone here that does
 
05:04:33.628 --> 05:04:33.638 align:start position:0%
so I'll wait and let them speak to it as
 
05:04:35.390 --> 05:04:35.400 align:start position:0%
an expert in that regard but I do
 
05:04:37.190 --> 05:04:37.200 align:start position:0%
appreciate the question representative
 
05:04:38.708 --> 05:04:38.718 align:start position:0%
thank you thank
 
05:04:42.628 --> 05:04:42.638 align:start position:0%
you any other questions from the
 
05:04:44.830 --> 05:04:44.840 align:start position:0%
committee thank you for your testimony
 
05:04:48.190 --> 05:04:48.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:52.430 --> 05:04:52.440 align:start position:0%
it all right um I call
 
05:04:57.430 --> 05:04:57.440 align:start position:0%
um Joyce oves I'm sorry if I
 
05:05:01.470 --> 05:05:01.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:01.480 --> 05:05:09.230 align:start position:0%
 
name

05:05:09.230 --> 05:05:09.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:12.788 --> 05:05:12.798 align:start position:0%
I didn't plan on speaking hello
 
05:05:17.470 --> 05:05:17.480 align:start position:0%
um I was more interested I came with an
 
05:05:21.070 --> 05:05:21.080 align:start position:0%
open mind because I could not
 
05:05:23.788 --> 05:05:23.798 align:start position:0%
understand how anything I have been
 
05:05:27.190 --> 05:05:27.200 align:start position:0%
doing for almost 40 years could be
 
05:05:30.910 --> 05:05:30.920 align:start position:0%
considered cruel I'm a pug
 
05:05:37.150 --> 05:05:37.160 align:start position:0%
breeder I read 37 litter and 106
 
05:05:41.110 --> 05:05:41.120 align:start position:0%
puppies but backing up before I even
 
05:05:41.120 --> 05:05:42.750 align:start position:0%
puppies but backing up before I even
bred

05:05:42.750 --> 05:05:42.760 align:start position:0%
bred
 
05:05:49.190 --> 05:05:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:52.430 --> 05:05:52.440 align:start position:0%
pug went neck to neck with my Irish
 
05:05:55.110 --> 05:05:55.120 align:start position:0%
Setter kept up doing
 
05:05:58.350 --> 05:05:58.360 align:start position:0%
everything I called them Peak Baggers
 
05:06:00.230 --> 05:06:00.240 align:start position:0%
they went Mountain
 
05:06:03.470 --> 05:06:03.480 align:start position:0%
hiking we went snow shooting
 
05:06:07.830 --> 05:06:07.840 align:start position:0%
uh CrossCountry skiing everything pugs
 
05:06:07.840 --> 05:06:09.590 align:start position:0%
uh CrossCountry skiing everything pugs
did

05:06:09.590 --> 05:06:09.600 align:start position:0%
did
 
05:06:14.990 --> 05:06:15.000 align:start position:0%
and then I got into pug breeding and um
 
05:06:17.910 --> 05:06:17.920 align:start position:0%
it's been a really learning experience
 
05:06:20.990 --> 05:06:21.000 align:start position:0%
no litter that I have bred has been
 
05:06:24.270 --> 05:06:24.280 align:start position:0%
alike they've all been different every
 
05:06:26.270 --> 05:06:26.280 align:start position:0%
pug I've
 
05:06:29.990 --> 05:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
bred has its own
 
05:06:33.548 --> 05:06:33.558 align:start position:0%
personality um I have never had a pug
 
05:06:35.430 --> 05:06:35.440 align:start position:0%
with a breathing
 
05:06:39.868 --> 05:06:39.878 align:start position:0%
issue um so that it affected its quality
 
05:06:41.948 --> 05:06:41.958 align:start position:0%
of life
 
05:06:47.708 --> 05:06:47.718 align:start position:0%
um to me a Pug was a perfect allaround
 
05:06:51.190 --> 05:06:51.200 align:start position:0%
dog um I used it in
 
05:06:54.070 --> 05:06:54.080 align:start position:0%
therapy I would bring it to the nursing
 
05:06:57.788 --> 05:06:57.798 align:start position:0%
homes twice a week um it was the perfect
 
05:07:00.708 --> 05:07:00.718 align:start position:0%
animal to the size
 
05:07:06.548 --> 05:07:06.558 align:start position:0%
to sit on a a senior lab
 
05:07:10.030 --> 05:07:10.040 align:start position:0%
um it just boggles my
 
05:07:15.670 --> 05:07:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:19.590 --> 05:07:19.600 align:start position:0%
considered cruelty it's like
 
05:07:19.600 --> 05:07:25.390 align:start position:0%
considered cruelty it's like
wow

05:07:25.390 --> 05:07:25.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:27.990 --> 05:07:28.000 align:start position:0%
um so many things
 
05:07:30.948 --> 05:07:30.958 align:start position:0%
were brought up to point when she
 
05:07:33.628 --> 05:07:33.638 align:start position:0%
presented this bill
 
05:07:37.548 --> 05:07:37.558 align:start position:0%
like I get health certificates for every
 
05:07:41.350 --> 05:07:41.360 align:start position:0%
litter and when I adopt my
 
05:07:45.868 --> 05:07:45.878 align:start position:0%
puppies they have to um go through a a
 
05:07:45.878 --> 05:07:47.350 align:start position:0%
puppies they have to um go through a a
really

05:07:47.350 --> 05:07:47.360 align:start position:0%
really
 
05:07:47.360 --> 05:07:49.030 align:start position:0%
really
long

05:07:49.030 --> 05:07:49.040 align:start position:0%
long
 
05:07:49.040 --> 05:07:50.830 align:start position:0%
long
process

05:07:50.830 --> 05:07:50.840 align:start position:0%
process
 
05:07:54.430 --> 05:07:54.440 align:start position:0%
um educating the the
 
05:07:58.390 --> 05:07:58.400 align:start position:0%
buyer and I always make
 
05:08:03.390 --> 05:08:03.400 align:start position:0%
them is that I'm done with oh okay
 
05:08:06.150 --> 05:08:06.160 align:start position:0%
they have to take any puppy that they
 
05:08:08.750 --> 05:08:08.760 align:start position:0%
adopt to a vet of their
 
05:08:12.708 --> 05:08:12.718 align:start position:0%
choice so they have two vet
 
05:08:15.788 --> 05:08:15.798 align:start position:0%
visits and there are certain items like
 
05:08:19.230 --> 05:08:19.240 align:start position:0%
luxating Pella that is
 
05:08:23.750 --> 05:08:23.760 align:start position:0%
subjective of one vet could find fine
 
05:08:26.948 --> 05:08:26.958 align:start position:0%
but the next vet you know within two
 
05:08:31.708 --> 05:08:31.718 align:start position:0%
days can say well you have a little a
 
05:08:34.350 --> 05:08:34.360 align:start position:0%
different grade of luxating
 
05:08:34.360 --> 05:08:36.670 align:start position:0%
different grade of luxating
patella

05:08:36.670 --> 05:08:36.680 align:start position:0%
patella
 
05:08:36.680 --> 05:08:39.510 align:start position:0%
patella
um

05:08:39.510 --> 05:08:39.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:08:42.910 --> 05:08:42.920 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you for listening thank you
 
05:08:44.230 --> 05:08:44.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony we
 
05:08:48.150 --> 05:08:48.160 align:start position:0%
appreciate what you have to say um any
 
05:08:51.110 --> 05:08:51.120 align:start position:0%
questions for the from the
 
05:08:53.548 --> 05:08:53.558 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you so much
 
05:08:56.910 --> 05:08:56.920 align:start position:0%
for coming today and and uh sharing your
 
05:09:01.110 --> 05:09:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:01.120 --> 05:09:29.310 align:start position:0%
 
lobe

05:09:29.310 --> 05:09:29.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:32.190 --> 05:09:32.200 align:start position:0%
good afternoon my name is Pam lob I'm
 
05:09:34.030 --> 05:09:34.040 align:start position:0%
here today uh representing the American
 
05:09:36.510 --> 05:09:36.520 align:start position:0%
Brussels Griffon Association I am
 
05:09:38.270 --> 05:09:38.280 align:start position:0%
fortunate to live in Vermont and was
 
05:09:40.628 --> 05:09:40.638 align:start position:0%
able to come over to represent my
 
05:09:44.990 --> 05:09:45.000 align:start position:0%
organization um these are my Brussels
 
05:09:47.470 --> 05:09:47.480 align:start position:0%
Griffons um so I have a written
 
05:09:49.910 --> 05:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
statement which I submitted and uh I
 
05:09:52.868 --> 05:09:52.878 align:start position:0%
also submitted a copy of the parent Club
 
05:09:54.868 --> 05:09:54.878 align:start position:0%
position statement which is also in the
 
05:09:59.110 --> 05:09:59.120 align:start position:0%
packet that Stacy submitted so um you've
 
05:10:01.230 --> 05:10:01.240 align:start position:0%
got multiple copies of it and I would
 
05:10:02.750 --> 05:10:02.760 align:start position:0%
like to read my statement but I would
 
05:10:03.830 --> 05:10:03.840 align:start position:0%
also like to address some of the
 
05:10:05.750 --> 05:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
comments that I've heard earlier today
 
05:10:07.150 --> 05:10:07.160 align:start position:0%
and some of the statements other people
 
05:10:09.350 --> 05:10:09.360 align:start position:0%
have made so I'm going to digress from
 
05:10:11.230 --> 05:10:11.240 align:start position:0%
my written statement a little bit here
 
05:10:14.110 --> 05:10:14.120 align:start position:0%
since you've all got a copy of that um
 
05:10:15.548 --> 05:10:15.558 align:start position:0%
one of the highlights of my written
 
05:10:17.070 --> 05:10:17.080 align:start position:0%
statement though is something that I
 
05:10:19.350 --> 05:10:19.360 align:start position:0%
learned when I lived in Maryland and we
 
05:10:22.110 --> 05:10:22.120 align:start position:0%
had a breed ban in our state and what I
 
05:10:24.708 --> 05:10:24.718 align:start position:0%
learned is if you legislate against
 
05:10:26.390 --> 05:10:26.400 align:start position:0%
something like dogs that people want to
 
05:10:29.270 --> 05:10:29.280 align:start position:0%
own people just go underground I will
 
05:10:31.788 --> 05:10:31.798 align:start position:0%
tell you that in 1997 we enacted a breed
 
05:10:34.590 --> 05:10:34.600 align:start position:0%
band against pitbulls this it is one of
 
05:10:36.110 --> 05:10:36.120 align:start position:0%
the few places in the nation that the
 
05:10:38.070 --> 05:10:38.080 align:start position:0%
ban is still on the books and the number
 
05:10:40.150 --> 05:10:40.160 align:start position:0%
of pitbulls in that county has not been
 
05:10:42.750 --> 05:10:42.760 align:start position:0%
decreased at all I can tell you that
 
05:10:43.868 --> 05:10:43.878 align:start position:0%
because I sat on the commission for
 
05:10:45.390 --> 05:10:45.400 align:start position:0%
animal control in my County I
 
05:10:48.590 --> 05:10:48.600 align:start position:0%
adjudicated those cases so legislation
 
05:10:50.868 --> 05:10:50.878 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily we can't legislate
 
05:10:53.270 --> 05:10:53.280 align:start position:0%
morality um so the legislation may or
 
05:10:55.350 --> 05:10:55.360 align:start position:0%
may not change what breeders do they may
 
05:10:57.590 --> 05:10:57.600 align:start position:0%
just go underground they'll stop getting
 
05:10:59.590 --> 05:10:59.600 align:start position:0%
dog licenses because they don't want a
 
05:11:01.390 --> 05:11:01.400 align:start position:0%
legal record of the fact that they own
 
05:11:02.830 --> 05:11:02.840 align:start position:0%
these breeds
 
05:11:06.590 --> 05:11:06.600 align:start position:0%
um so that becomes a concern um another
 
05:11:11.628 --> 05:11:11.638 align:start position:0%
concern that um was brought up that um
 
05:11:13.430 --> 05:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
I'm I've listened to the comments and
 
05:11:15.310 --> 05:11:15.320 align:start position:0%
that sort of thing um there was a
 
05:11:18.270 --> 05:11:18.280 align:start position:0%
question about genetics and about color
 
05:11:20.830 --> 05:11:20.840 align:start position:0%
um brachy has nothing to do with the
 
05:11:23.110 --> 05:11:23.120 align:start position:0%
color of a dog but the reason some of
 
05:11:25.670 --> 05:11:25.680 align:start position:0%
our breed standards uh list certain
 
05:11:27.708 --> 05:11:27.718 align:start position:0%
acceptable colors and certain colors not
 
05:11:29.430 --> 05:11:29.440 align:start position:0%
acceptable to answer your question
 
05:11:32.030 --> 05:11:32.040 align:start position:0%
earlier there are certain issues in
 
05:11:35.830 --> 05:11:35.840 align:start position:0%
genetics with dilute genes so if you
 
05:11:38.270 --> 05:11:38.280 align:start position:0%
have a black dog and you have a sort of
 
05:11:41.390 --> 05:11:41.400 align:start position:0%
a gray colored dog in dogs most of us
 
05:11:43.868 --> 05:11:43.878 align:start position:0%
call that gray color blue so if you've
 
05:11:47.030 --> 05:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
heard of blue dogs um there is a
 
05:11:49.868 --> 05:11:49.878 align:start position:0%
dilution Gene that causes the black to
 
05:11:53.470 --> 05:11:53.480 align:start position:0%
dilute and become blue and in many
 
05:11:55.830 --> 05:11:55.840 align:start position:0%
breeds not all but in many breeds
 
05:11:58.070 --> 05:11:58.080 align:start position:0%
there's something called color dilution
 
05:12:01.310 --> 05:12:01.320 align:start position:0%
alopecia and you can Google that and uh
 
05:12:04.430 --> 05:12:04.440 align:start position:0%
it means that blue dogs and dilute brown
 
05:12:07.750 --> 05:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
dogs sort of the cream color dogs um can
 
05:12:10.110 --> 05:12:10.120 align:start position:0%
lose their hair there's a video that
 
05:12:12.150 --> 05:12:12.160 align:start position:0%
went around last year of a border
 
05:12:13.868 --> 05:12:13.878 align:start position:0%
colleague running at CRTs running
 
05:12:17.070 --> 05:12:17.080 align:start position:0%
agility beautiful run the dog's back is
 
05:12:19.310 --> 05:12:19.320 align:start position:0%
completely balded that dog was blue and
 
05:12:21.590 --> 05:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
white he was very athletic he could
 
05:12:24.910 --> 05:12:24.920 align:start position:0%
still run but he had no hair I am not a
 
05:12:27.868 --> 05:12:27.878 align:start position:0%
breeder I'm an owner of dogs I represent
 
05:12:30.948 --> 05:12:30.958 align:start position:0%
a a parent Club but as a breeder if I
 
05:12:32.788 --> 05:12:32.798 align:start position:0%
had a dog that had alipa I wouldn't be
 
05:12:37.750 --> 05:12:37.760 align:start position:0%
breeding that dog um okay uh by the same
 
05:12:40.510 --> 05:12:40.520 align:start position:0%
nature my breed is you've got videos
 
05:12:42.150 --> 05:12:42.160 align:start position:0%
that were submitted of my breed running
 
05:12:45.070 --> 05:12:45.080 align:start position:0%
agility my breed running fast cat my own
 
05:12:48.350 --> 05:12:48.360 align:start position:0%
dog is in the AKC book of the dog doing
 
05:12:50.628 --> 05:12:50.638 align:start position:0%
obedience um he's got a dumbbell in his
 
05:12:52.750 --> 05:12:52.760 align:start position:0%
mouth and he's clearing a jump he's got
 
05:12:54.470 --> 05:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
as flat a face as they come but he did
 
05:12:56.708 --> 05:12:56.718 align:start position:0%
scent discrimination he did the retrieve
 
05:12:59.590 --> 05:12:59.600 align:start position:0%
he did all of those things so there are
 
05:13:01.230 --> 05:13:01.240 align:start position:0%
I've flown my dogs annually to
 
05:13:02.990 --> 05:13:03.000 align:start position:0%
Louisville entucky to my National
 
05:13:05.868 --> 05:13:05.878 align:start position:0%
Specialty flat-faced dog I can fly him
 
05:13:09.548 --> 05:13:09.558 align:start position:0%
braisy is just a descriptive term um
 
05:13:11.390 --> 05:13:11.400 align:start position:0%
that's you know again it's not all in my
 
05:13:13.110 --> 05:13:13.120 align:start position:0%
written statement but those are some of
 
05:13:15.390 --> 05:13:15.400 align:start position:0%
the questions people had um the
 
05:13:17.390 --> 05:13:17.400 align:start position:0%
C-section question my dogs were born
 
05:13:19.430 --> 05:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
naturally they were weled naturally I
 
05:13:21.270 --> 05:13:21.280 align:start position:0%
know a lot of women who schedule
 
05:13:23.070 --> 05:13:23.080 align:start position:0%
C-sections as to have it on their
 
05:13:25.230 --> 05:13:25.240 align:start position:0%
convenience rather than giving birth at
 
05:13:26.510 --> 05:13:26.520 align:start position:0%
2 o'clock in the morning when their
 
05:13:29.510 --> 05:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
OBGYN may not be available it happens in
 
05:13:32.430 --> 05:13:32.440 align:start position:0%
people too it's not just dogs so I thank
 
05:13:34.030 --> 05:13:34.040 align:start position:0%
you all very much for your time and for
 
05:13:35.628 --> 05:13:35.638 align:start position:0%
allowing an out of stator to come and
 
05:13:38.548 --> 05:13:38.558 align:start position:0%
testify happy to answer any question
 
05:13:43.788 --> 05:13:43.798 align:start position:0%
absolutely um so again the term
 
05:13:46.910 --> 05:13:46.920 align:start position:0%
brai does not necessarily mean unhealthy
 
05:13:48.670 --> 05:13:48.680 align:start position:0%
correct and it does not necessarily mean
 
05:13:51.470 --> 05:13:51.480 align:start position:0%
the dog is suffering correct or cat
 
05:13:53.830 --> 05:13:53.840 align:start position:0%
whatever I did medical transcription for
 
05:13:56.390 --> 05:13:56.400 align:start position:0%
20 years and it's a word in dorland's
 
05:13:58.310 --> 05:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
medical dictionary it's a descriptive
 
05:14:00.868 --> 05:14:00.878 align:start position:0%
word there's there's another word for
 
05:14:03.470 --> 05:14:03.480 align:start position:0%
longf Coles there's a word that
 
05:14:05.750 --> 05:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
describes that do you consider that a
 
05:14:09.948 --> 05:14:09.958 align:start position:0%
birth defect absolutely not okay thank
 
05:14:13.510 --> 05:14:13.520 align:start position:0%
you any other question represented
 
05:14:16.030 --> 05:14:16.040 align:start position:0%
Penza so I'm G to try to pronounce it
 
05:14:19.868 --> 05:14:19.878 align:start position:0%
braas wow okay so that um so would you
 
05:14:21.990 --> 05:14:22.000 align:start position:0%
consider that like let's say if we're
 
05:14:24.750 --> 05:14:24.760 align:start position:0%
comparing that to a human so I had my
 
05:14:26.470 --> 05:14:26.480 align:start position:0%
nose broken three times I had a DV
 
05:14:28.230 --> 05:14:28.240 align:start position:0%
symptom I could still breathe so are you
 
05:14:29.948 --> 05:14:29.958 align:start position:0%
considering that kind of like the same
 
05:14:32.510 --> 05:14:32.520 align:start position:0%
thing well braie SE y just means
 
05:14:35.070 --> 05:14:35.080 align:start position:0%
flat-faced or flath headed it doesn't
 
05:14:37.628 --> 05:14:37.638 align:start position:0%
really describe ability to breathe it
 
05:14:42.310 --> 05:14:42.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't describe any um physiological
 
05:14:44.868 --> 05:14:44.878 align:start position:0%
abilities it's it's a descriptive it's
 
05:14:47.670 --> 05:14:47.680 align:start position:0%
like saying this table is flat okay it
 
05:14:49.670 --> 05:14:49.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't address whether this is a sturdy
 
05:14:51.868 --> 05:14:51.878 align:start position:0%
table or whether this is a functional
 
05:14:53.948 --> 05:14:53.958 align:start position:0%
table it just means that this table is
 
05:14:57.270 --> 05:14:57.280 align:start position:0%
flat and the dog's face is flattened or
 
05:14:59.948 --> 05:14:59.958 align:start position:0%
head is flattened now brachy calic
 
05:15:02.310 --> 05:15:02.320 align:start position:0%
breeds can be Cavalier ch King Charles
 
05:15:05.990 --> 05:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
Spaniels they have faces um Chows are
 
05:15:09.310 --> 05:15:09.320 align:start position:0%
considered braches spalc they have noses
 
05:15:11.750 --> 05:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
um there are a number of breeds that
 
05:15:13.910 --> 05:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
fall under the characteristic
 
05:15:13.920 --> 05:15:15.430 align:start position:0%
fall under the characteristic
Rottweilers

05:15:15.430 --> 05:15:15.440 align:start position:0%
Rottweilers
 
05:15:18.910 --> 05:15:18.920 align:start position:0%
Boxers um they have length of muzzle but
 
05:15:21.590 --> 05:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
it's a shortened length of muzzle it
 
05:15:24.510 --> 05:15:24.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't describe it as being ineffective
 
05:15:27.230 --> 05:15:27.240 align:start position:0%
or inefficient just that it's flatter
 
05:15:29.430 --> 05:15:29.440 align:start position:0%
it's just again it's just a descriptive
 
05:15:32.230 --> 05:15:32.240 align:start position:0%
terminology word
 
05:15:34.750 --> 05:15:34.760 align:start position:0%
represent Gera thank you madam chair
 
05:15:36.190 --> 05:15:36.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question so I I
 
05:15:38.548 --> 05:15:38.558 align:start position:0%
think we've heard a lot of testimony and
 
05:15:41.948 --> 05:15:41.958 align:start position:0%
strong sense that using brachy is is not
 
05:15:44.868 --> 05:15:44.878 align:start position:0%
the appropriate way uh to to just you
 
05:15:46.750 --> 05:15:46.760 align:start position:0%
know approach this issue because it's
 
05:15:49.590 --> 05:15:49.600 align:start position:0%
it's a phenotype not a genotype Etc um
 
05:15:50.868 --> 05:15:50.878 align:start position:0%
so I'll ask you the same question I
 
05:15:53.190 --> 05:15:53.200 align:start position:0%
asked somebody else earlier does it make
 
05:15:55.868 --> 05:15:55.878 align:start position:0%
sense would this bill be better if it
 
05:15:58.708 --> 05:15:58.718 align:start position:0%
focused on boas which is a syndrome
 
05:16:00.310 --> 05:16:00.320 align:start position:0%
right so by definition again it's a
 
05:16:02.030 --> 05:16:02.040 align:start position:0%
pathological condition
 
05:16:04.788 --> 05:16:04.798 align:start position:0%
uh rather than what I think we should
 
05:16:06.110 --> 05:16:06.120 align:start position:0%
all at this point have reached the
 
05:16:09.310 --> 05:16:09.320 align:start position:0%
conclusion that the descriptor is not
 
05:16:10.830 --> 05:16:10.840 align:start position:0%
what we should be concentrating on here
 
05:16:14.548 --> 05:16:14.558 align:start position:0%
but rather the condition well I can say
 
05:16:16.350 --> 05:16:16.360 align:start position:0%
that the
 
05:16:19.708 --> 05:16:19.718 align:start position:0%
concept of finding a condition like that
 
05:16:19.718 --> 05:16:20.548 align:start position:0%
concept of finding a condition like that
to

05:16:20.548 --> 05:16:20.558 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:16:24.390 --> 05:16:24.400 align:start position:0%
be illegal by definition it becomes
 
05:16:27.590 --> 05:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
illegal um is an interesting
 
05:16:30.910 --> 05:16:30.920 align:start position:0%
concept but how are we enforcing this is
 
05:16:32.868 --> 05:16:32.878 align:start position:0%
somebody going to knock on every door of
 
05:16:36.230 --> 05:16:36.240 align:start position:0%
every dog breeder and check on this is
 
05:16:38.830 --> 05:16:38.840 align:start position:0%
every puppy going to have to be seen and
 
05:16:42.990 --> 05:16:43.000 align:start position:0%
certified by a vet as free of this and
 
05:16:46.230 --> 05:16:46.240 align:start position:0%
if you do find that somebody has
 
05:16:48.868 --> 05:16:48.878 align:start position:0%
produced uh braches spalc obstructive
 
05:16:53.868 --> 05:16:53.878 align:start position:0%
Airway syndrome um are we are we
 
05:16:57.110 --> 05:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
imprisoning this person are we disposing
 
05:16:59.510 --> 05:16:59.520 align:start position:0%
of these dogs we had a term in Prince
 
05:17:00.910 --> 05:17:00.920 align:start position:0%
George's County Maryland we're going to
 
05:17:03.708 --> 05:17:03.718 align:start position:0%
dispose of the dogs according to law and
 
05:17:05.430 --> 05:17:05.440 align:start position:0%
that mean we were putting the dog to
 
05:17:07.350 --> 05:17:07.360 align:start position:0%
sleep we were euthanizing that animal
 
05:17:09.590 --> 05:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
that was disposed of according to law is
 
05:17:10.590 --> 05:17:10.600 align:start position:0%
that what's going to happen to these
 
05:17:13.350 --> 05:17:13.360 align:start position:0%
brachy pallic animals or these dogs with
 
05:17:15.390 --> 05:17:15.400 align:start position:0%
you know obstructive Airway disorder
 
05:17:18.868 --> 05:17:18.878 align:start position:0%
what what is I understand that the
 
05:17:22.270 --> 05:17:22.280 align:start position:0%
sponsor um is trying to protect people
 
05:17:24.070 --> 05:17:24.080 align:start position:0%
from having to live with sick animals
 
05:17:26.390 --> 05:17:26.400 align:start position:0%
nobody wants to live with a sick animal
 
05:17:28.350 --> 05:17:28.360 align:start position:0%
um it's pretty miserable living a dog
 
05:17:30.390 --> 05:17:30.400 align:start position:0%
with skin allergies I don't want to
 
05:17:32.830 --> 05:17:32.840 align:start position:0%
produce dogs with skin skin allergies
 
05:17:35.868 --> 05:17:35.878 align:start position:0%
but I don't think that we can legislate
 
05:17:39.150 --> 05:17:39.160 align:start position:0%
that because there are degrees and I
 
05:17:40.708 --> 05:17:40.718 align:start position:0%
think that ultimately we're talking
 
05:17:43.190 --> 05:17:43.200 align:start position:0%
about living creatures and What Becomes
 
05:17:44.708 --> 05:17:44.718 align:start position:0%
of those living creatures that are now
 
05:17:46.628 --> 05:17:46.638 align:start position:0%
in violation of this
 
05:17:49.590 --> 05:17:49.600 align:start position:0%
law thank
 
05:17:52.868 --> 05:17:52.878 align:start position:0%
you any other questions thank you very
 
05:17:55.150 --> 05:17:55.160 align:start position:0%
much for your testimony this afternoon
 
05:17:56.948 --> 05:17:56.958 align:start position:0%
thank you for having you I'd like to
 
05:18:00.310 --> 05:18:00.320 align:start position:0%

05:18:19.868 --> 05:18:19.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:22.788 --> 05:18:22.798 align:start position:0%
thank you hi good afternoon good
 
05:18:25.628 --> 05:18:25.638 align:start position:0%
afternoon uh thank you for having me my
 
05:18:27.470 --> 05:18:27.480 align:start position:0%
name is Dr James chelini I've been a
 
05:18:29.590 --> 05:18:29.600 align:start position:0%
board-certified Veterinary neurologist
 
05:18:32.110 --> 05:18:32.120 align:start position:0%
and neurosurgeon for about seven years
 
05:18:34.868 --> 05:18:34.878 align:start position:0%
and a veterinarian since 2009 I'm
 
05:18:37.270 --> 05:18:37.280 align:start position:0%
currently licensed in Rhode Island and
 
05:18:41.270 --> 05:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
overall I am in support of Bill HB 1102
 
05:18:44.070 --> 05:18:44.080 align:start position:0%
because is my professional and personal
 
05:18:45.830 --> 05:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
belief that Brey seili is the worst
 
05:18:49.030 --> 05:18:49.040 align:start position:0%
burden ever placed upon companion
 
05:18:51.350 --> 05:18:51.360 align:start position:0%
animals it would be very easy for me to
 
05:18:54.110 --> 05:18:54.120 align:start position:0%
Simply provide many examples of Brey
 
05:18:56.310 --> 05:18:56.320 align:start position:0%
spelic dog suffering that I've witnessed
 
05:18:58.470 --> 05:18:58.480 align:start position:0%
throughout my career just this last week
 
05:19:00.070 --> 05:19:00.080 align:start position:0%
I performed spinal surgery on three
 
05:19:02.510 --> 05:19:02.520 align:start position:0%
French bulldogs I currently work at a
 
05:19:04.910 --> 05:19:04.920 align:start position:0%
very large 247 ER and Specialty Center
 
05:19:07.150 --> 05:19:07.160 align:start position:0%
in Rhode Island and I've spent my career
 
05:19:09.548 --> 05:19:09.558 align:start position:0%
working only in facilities such as this
 
05:19:10.948 --> 05:19:10.958 align:start position:0%
across the country during my various
 
05:19:13.590 --> 05:19:13.600 align:start position:0%
stages of training it would also be easy
 
05:19:15.470 --> 05:19:15.480 align:start position:0%
for me to Simply state that I've never
 
05:19:17.430 --> 05:19:17.440 align:start position:0%
met a specialist or an emergency vet
 
05:19:19.470 --> 05:19:19.480 align:start position:0%
that doesn't share my view in relation
 
05:19:22.628 --> 05:19:22.638 align:start position:0%
to break SE which is that break sey is
 
05:19:24.350 --> 05:19:24.360 align:start position:0%
by and large not in the best interest of
 
05:19:26.590 --> 05:19:26.600 align:start position:0%
the animal and leads to a tremendous
 
05:19:29.430 --> 05:19:29.440 align:start position:0%
amount of morbidity and mortality the
 
05:19:31.548 --> 05:19:31.558 align:start position:0%
problem though with simply show showing
 
05:19:34.350 --> 05:19:34.360 align:start position:0%
cases of these dogs suffering is that
 
05:19:36.350 --> 05:19:36.360 align:start position:0%
those who support the creation of Breaky
 
05:19:38.948 --> 05:19:38.958 align:start position:0%
calic pets such as breeders can simply
 
05:19:40.948 --> 05:19:40.958 align:start position:0%
always default to a common argument
 
05:19:44.270 --> 05:19:44.280 align:start position:0%
which is that only poorly bred bralic
 
05:19:47.390 --> 05:19:47.400 align:start position:0%
dogs suffer by Shifting the blame onto
 
05:19:50.350 --> 05:19:50.360 align:start position:0%
backyard breeders or unethical breeders
 
05:19:52.150 --> 05:19:52.160 align:start position:0%
terms which have no real consistent
 
05:19:54.548 --> 05:19:54.558 align:start position:0%
definition Breaky calic dog and cat
 
05:19:56.230 --> 05:19:56.240 align:start position:0%
breeders are able to absolve themselves
 
05:19:58.070 --> 05:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
from the truth of the matter which is
 
05:20:00.350 --> 05:20:00.360 align:start position:0%
that Breaky SEI is intentional malformed
 
05:20:02.670 --> 05:20:02.680 align:start position:0%
Anatomy that greatly reduces the quality
 
05:20:04.670 --> 05:20:04.680 align:start position:0%
of life of a significant portion of
 
05:20:07.230 --> 05:20:07.240 align:start position:0%
those dogs that suffer from it I'd like
 
05:20:08.670 --> 05:20:08.680 align:start position:0%
to reference the breed standards from
 
05:20:10.230 --> 05:20:10.240 align:start position:0%
four the more popular dog breeds
 
05:20:11.868 --> 05:20:11.878 align:start position:0%
according to the AKC the Frenchie the
 
05:20:13.708 --> 05:20:13.718 align:start position:0%
English Bulldog the Boston teror and the
 
05:20:16.190 --> 05:20:16.200 align:start position:0%
Pug the breed clubs of all four of these
 
05:20:17.910 --> 05:20:17.920 align:start position:0%
breeds describe a breed standard that
 
05:20:19.470 --> 05:20:19.480 align:start position:0%
calls for severe
 
05:20:23.070 --> 05:20:23.080 align:start position:0%
brachy in the French Bulldog they list a
 
05:20:26.150 --> 05:20:26.160 align:start position:0%
extremely short nose the English bulldog
 
05:20:28.350 --> 05:20:28.360 align:start position:0%
lists extremely short face and muzzle
 
05:20:30.110 --> 05:20:30.120 align:start position:0%
and the Boston interior literally shows
 
05:20:34.070 --> 05:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
a correct more braic example versus an
 
05:20:36.910 --> 05:20:36.920 align:start position:0%
incorrect less brachy calic example they
 
05:20:38.948 --> 05:20:38.958 align:start position:0%
have it backwards they're likely going
 
05:20:40.350 --> 05:20:40.360 align:start position:0%
to be many who oppose this bill while
 
05:20:42.708 --> 05:20:42.718 align:start position:0%
using the argument that not all brachy
 
05:20:45.390 --> 05:20:45.400 align:start position:0%
calic animals suffer many dog owners and
 
05:20:46.750 --> 05:20:46.760 align:start position:0%
breed enthusiasts like to show their
 
05:20:48.868 --> 05:20:48.878 align:start position:0%
dogs running agility training and being
 
05:20:51.030 --> 05:20:51.040 align:start position:0%
very active in general as evidence that
 
05:20:53.030 --> 05:20:53.040 align:start position:0%
being braak calic doesn't necessarily
 
05:20:55.150 --> 05:20:55.160 align:start position:0%
mean your suffering this completely
 
05:20:57.868 --> 05:20:57.878 align:start position:0%
misses the point first of all research
 
05:20:59.350 --> 05:20:59.360 align:start position:0%
has shown that by and large the public
 
05:21:01.470 --> 05:21:01.480 align:start position:0%
does not recognize many of the sympt of
 
05:21:03.230 --> 05:21:03.240 align:start position:0%
distress that these breeds show and
 
05:21:04.788 --> 05:21:04.798 align:start position:0%
they're in fact encouraged as some sort
 
05:21:06.628 --> 05:21:06.638 align:start position:0%
of quirky behavior in inherent to the
 
05:21:09.270 --> 05:21:09.280 align:start position:0%
breed refering I'm referring to snorting
 
05:21:11.150 --> 05:21:11.160 align:start position:0%
snoring and overall loud breathing
 
05:21:13.150 --> 05:21:13.160 align:start position:0%
considered normal for these breeds
 
05:21:14.590 --> 05:21:14.600 align:start position:0%
secondly no one on my side of the
 
05:21:16.868 --> 05:21:16.878 align:start position:0%
argument to my knowledge is arguing that
 
05:21:19.670 --> 05:21:19.680 align:start position:0%
100% of brachy calic dogs are miserable
 
05:21:22.350 --> 05:21:22.360 align:start position:0%
and in pain 247 the fact of the matter
 
05:21:23.868 --> 05:21:23.878 align:start position:0%
is that when you strive to create a dog
 
05:21:26.350 --> 05:21:26.360 align:start position:0%
whose breed standard is an anatomical
 
05:21:28.390 --> 05:21:28.400 align:start position:0%
malformation you may manage to create
 
05:21:30.670 --> 05:21:30.680 align:start position:0%
many dogs who overcome their disability
 
05:21:32.990 --> 05:21:33.000 align:start position:0%
at appear outwardly happy and healthy
 
05:21:34.590 --> 05:21:34.600 align:start position:0%
but you will also create many dogs who
 
05:21:35.990 --> 05:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
suffer a lifetime of difficulty
 
05:21:38.270 --> 05:21:38.280 align:start position:0%
breathing chronic pain and immobility it
 
05:21:40.430 --> 05:21:40.440 align:start position:0%
is both the pursuit of a faulty standard
 
05:21:41.948 --> 05:21:41.958 align:start position:0%
and the standard itself that should
 
05:21:43.868 --> 05:21:43.878 align:start position:0%
either change or stop in my
 
05:21:45.990 --> 05:21:46.000 align:start position:0%
opinion I'd like to also address the
 
05:21:48.190 --> 05:21:48.200 align:start position:0%
notion if I may that there is no
 
05:21:50.070 --> 05:21:50.080 align:start position:0%
evidence to support braisy being
 
05:21:52.430 --> 05:21:52.440 align:start position:0%
inherently bad for an animals Health I'd
 
05:21:53.948 --> 05:21:53.958 align:start position:0%
like to refer anyone interested in
 
05:21:55.470 --> 05:21:55.480 align:start position:0%
researching this to a website called
 
05:21:57.350 --> 05:21:57.360 align:start position:0%
PubMed where you can type in the words
 
05:21:59.590 --> 05:21:59.600 align:start position:0%
Breaky seil dog and immediately have
 
05:22:01.788 --> 05:22:01.798 align:start position:0%
access to dozens of research AR articles
 
05:22:01.798 --> 05:22:02.868 align:start position:0%
access to dozens of research AR articles
investigating

05:22:02.868 --> 05:22:02.878 align:start position:0%
investigating
 
05:22:05.150 --> 05:22:05.160 align:start position:0%
brachy I would also like to point out
 
05:22:07.510 --> 05:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
that the term brachy spalc obstructive
 
05:22:10.230 --> 05:22:10.240 align:start position:0%
Airway syndrome or Boaz for short starts
 
05:22:12.470 --> 05:22:12.480 align:start position:0%
with the word brachy calic it is
 
05:22:14.590 --> 05:22:14.600 align:start position:0%
essentially exclusive to these dogs with
 
05:22:16.990 --> 05:22:17.000 align:start position:0%
that confirmation the breed standards
 
05:22:19.350 --> 05:22:19.360 align:start position:0%
are the disease I could go on and on
 
05:22:21.270 --> 05:22:21.280 align:start position:0%
about how Breaky seil and boxers Boston
 
05:22:22.788 --> 05:22:22.798 align:start position:0%
Terriers and Bulldogs has linked to a
 
05:22:24.310 --> 05:22:24.320 align:start position:0%
much higher risk of malignant brain
 
05:22:26.350 --> 05:22:26.360 align:start position:0%
cancer I could also go on about the
 
05:22:28.110 --> 05:22:28.120 align:start position:0%
spinal malformations that are literally
 
05:22:30.030 --> 05:22:30.040 align:start position:0%
built into French and English bulldogs
 
05:22:31.830 --> 05:22:31.840 align:start position:0%
and Boston teriors thanks to the
 
05:22:34.230 --> 05:22:34.240 align:start position:0%
disheveled 2 genetic variant or how
 
05:22:35.750 --> 05:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
French Bulldogs frequently die from a
 
05:22:38.270 --> 05:22:38.280 align:start position:0%
herniated disc or the horrific skull
 
05:22:40.670 --> 05:22:40.680 align:start position:0%
morphologies of Persian cats or the fact
 
05:22:42.030 --> 05:22:42.040 align:start position:0%
that Breaky Violet dogs have
 
05:22:43.830 --> 05:22:43.840 align:start position:0%
significantly shorter lifespans and are
 
05:22:46.390 --> 05:22:46.400 align:start position:0%
four times more expensive to ensure for
 
05:22:49.628 --> 05:22:49.638 align:start position:0%
their pet owners okay your time is up
 
05:22:52.070 --> 05:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
sir and can we have a copy of your
 
05:22:54.430 --> 05:22:54.440 align:start position:0%
testimony do you have you want to know
 
05:22:56.548 --> 05:22:56.558 align:start position:0%
yeah sure are there representative Bixby
 
05:22:59.868 --> 05:22:59.878 align:start position:0%
we have questions also to you for
 
05:22:59.878 --> 05:23:02.190 align:start position:0%
we have questions also to you for
you

05:23:02.190 --> 05:23:02.200 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:23:02.200 --> 05:23:08.110 align:start position:0%
you
thank

05:23:08.110 --> 05:23:08.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:12.310 --> 05:23:12.320 align:start position:0%
you yeah so um I was wondering if uh
 
05:23:15.670 --> 05:23:15.680 align:start position:0%
brechos phallic breeds tend to uh
 
05:23:18.310 --> 05:23:18.320 align:start position:0%
exhibit higher levels of
 
05:23:21.430 --> 05:23:21.440 align:start position:0%
corticosteroids higher I don't know okay
 
05:23:24.350 --> 05:23:24.360 align:start position:0%
because which corticosteroids are of
 
05:23:27.910 --> 05:23:27.920 align:start position:0%
course a a stress one so okay are you
 
05:23:30.110 --> 05:23:30.120 align:start position:0%
you're aware of that right of what a
 
05:23:32.868 --> 05:23:32.878 align:start position:0%
cortical steroid it is yes yes yes and
 
05:23:34.190 --> 05:23:34.200 align:start position:0%
that and that they are they're
 
05:23:37.070 --> 05:23:37.080 align:start position:0%
associated with higher levels of stress
 
05:23:39.110 --> 05:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
okay thank
 
05:23:41.830 --> 05:23:41.840 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
05:23:44.548 --> 05:23:44.558 align:start position:0%
Penza so my question is about the
 
05:23:46.628 --> 05:23:46.638 align:start position:0%
insurance piece because um someone spoke
 
05:23:48.788 --> 05:23:48.798 align:start position:0%
about that earlier uh we got a lot of
 
05:23:51.590 --> 05:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
testimony of course pro and con in in
 
05:23:54.310 --> 05:23:54.320 align:start position:0%
regards with this and um pretty pretty
 
05:23:56.310 --> 05:23:56.320 align:start position:0%
much I I know this from a friend of mine
 
05:23:58.868 --> 05:23:58.878 align:start position:0%
that uh they had pet insurance and they
 
05:24:01.788 --> 05:24:01.798 align:start position:0%
had to spend about I don't know
 
05:24:04.270 --> 05:24:04.280 align:start position:0%
$7,000 um out of pocket that was some
 
05:24:07.590 --> 05:24:07.600 align:start position:0%
was covered by insurance for their um
 
05:24:10.070 --> 05:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
surgery that happened to their pug but
 
05:24:11.830 --> 05:24:11.840 align:start position:0%
um so can you speak to that just a
 
05:24:14.628 --> 05:24:14.638 align:start position:0%
little bit about um because pet
 
05:24:16.150 --> 05:24:16.160 align:start position:0%
insurance should be a given especially
 
05:24:17.390 --> 05:24:17.400 align:start position:0%
when you're spending a lot of money on a
 
05:24:22.150 --> 05:24:22.160 align:start position:0%
dog so where yeah so um I cited that uh
 
05:24:24.990 --> 05:24:25.000 align:start position:0%
data from a paper study uh published in
 
05:24:26.788 --> 05:24:26.798 align:start position:0%
the vet record journal in
 
05:24:30.190 --> 05:24:30.200 align:start position:0%
2020 um I think the bigger issue are you
 
05:24:32.270 --> 05:24:32.280 align:start position:0%
asking like should owners just be aware
 
05:24:34.948 --> 05:24:34.958 align:start position:0%
of pet insurance for these own just like
 
05:24:37.830 --> 05:24:37.840 align:start position:0%
the there automatically pet insurance is
 
05:24:39.868 --> 05:24:39.878 align:start position:0%
not covering you know they're not
 
05:24:42.070 --> 05:24:42.080 align:start position:0%
covering for these surgeries or they're
 
05:24:43.708 --> 05:24:43.718 align:start position:0%
considered I'm hearing that more and
 
05:24:45.750 --> 05:24:45.760 align:start position:0%
more from clients because the pet
 
05:24:47.670 --> 05:24:47.680 align:start position:0%
insurance companies are getting wise to
 
05:24:49.030 --> 05:24:49.040 align:start position:0%
the fact that they are having to Shell
 
05:24:52.350 --> 05:24:52.360 align:start position:0%
out five figure reimbursements to people
 
05:24:55.350 --> 05:24:55.360 align:start position:0%
for these pets and they are thus hiking
 
05:24:56.948 --> 05:24:56.958 align:start position:0%
their premiums in the first place if you
 
05:25:00.190 --> 05:25:00.200 align:start position:0%
look on any uh pet insurance premium
 
05:25:01.868 --> 05:25:01.878 align:start position:0%
aggregate website you'll see that these
 
05:25:04.830 --> 05:25:04.840 align:start position:0%
animals have the highest premiums way
 
05:25:08.390 --> 05:25:08.400 align:start position:0%
disproportional to their size um and a
 
05:25:10.190 --> 05:25:10.200 align:start position:0%
lot of pet insurance companies are no
 
05:25:12.548 --> 05:25:12.558 align:start position:0%
longer covering things because they
 
05:25:14.270 --> 05:25:14.280 align:start position:0%
happen so frequently in these dogs
 
05:25:15.948 --> 05:25:15.958 align:start position:0%
they're just viewing them as inherent
 
05:25:18.190 --> 05:25:18.200 align:start position:0%
parts of the dog more or less and so
 
05:25:20.270 --> 05:25:20.280 align:start position:0%
they're declining
 
05:25:20.280 --> 05:25:21.910 align:start position:0%
they're declining
coverage

05:25:21.910 --> 05:25:21.920 align:start position:0%
coverage
 
05:25:24.628 --> 05:25:24.638 align:start position:0%
okay oh H Haskins rep representative
 
05:25:26.948 --> 05:25:26.958 align:start position:0%
Haskins I'm sorry thank you madam chair
 
05:25:29.590 --> 05:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question do
 
05:25:32.390 --> 05:25:32.400 align:start position:0%
you have access to information that
 
05:25:36.110 --> 05:25:36.120 align:start position:0%
would help us determine why this is
 
05:25:40.030 --> 05:25:40.040 align:start position:0%
controversial among um animal breeders
 
05:25:42.830 --> 05:25:42.840 align:start position:0%
who obviously love their animals and
 
05:25:46.310 --> 05:25:46.320 align:start position:0%
some have studied their breed and yet
 
05:25:48.948 --> 05:25:48.958 align:start position:0%
there's a contradiction here at hand
 
05:25:51.390 --> 05:25:51.400 align:start position:0%
that we have to deal with as to whether
 
05:25:55.708 --> 05:25:55.718 align:start position:0%
or not brachio is actually a deformity
 
05:25:59.788 --> 05:25:59.798 align:start position:0%
could you speak to that at all um as far
 
05:26:03.190 --> 05:26:03.200 align:start position:0%
like why why breeders are hesitant to
 
05:26:05.628 --> 05:26:05.638 align:start position:0%
why is it a deformity in your view when
 
05:26:07.310 --> 05:26:07.320 align:start position:0%
it's just
 
05:26:12.070 --> 05:26:12.080 align:start position:0%
a um well okay so for one it I'm not
 
05:26:13.830 --> 05:26:13.840 align:start position:0%
aware of any instance in nature where
 
05:26:16.510 --> 05:26:16.520 align:start position:0%
Brak SE just pops up and it's part
 
05:26:18.948 --> 05:26:18.958 align:start position:0%
of an animal's being I mean where do you
 
05:26:21.430 --> 05:26:21.440 align:start position:0%
see this you know anywhere um there may
 
05:26:24.510 --> 05:26:24.520 align:start position:0%
be some example somewhere but the facts
 
05:26:27.470 --> 05:26:27.480 align:start position:0%
remains that this has been artificially
 
05:26:29.750 --> 05:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
selected for decades if not maybe like a
 
05:26:32.910 --> 05:26:32.920 align:start position:0%
couple hundred thousands of years by now
 
05:26:37.030 --> 05:26:37.040 align:start position:0%
um and I in my opinion I think breeders
 
05:26:41.670 --> 05:26:41.680 align:start position:0%
are hesitant to change because a it's
 
05:26:43.350 --> 05:26:43.360 align:start position:0%
hard to
 
05:26:46.230 --> 05:26:46.240 align:start position:0%
find it's hard to find the Gen genetic
 
05:26:49.030 --> 05:26:49.040 align:start position:0%
diversity Within These breeds to do that
 
05:26:51.470 --> 05:26:51.480 align:start position:0%
if you set out to say Okay I want to
 
05:26:54.230 --> 05:26:54.240 align:start position:0%
make two French Bulldogs breed and
 
05:26:55.788 --> 05:26:55.798 align:start position:0%
produce puppies that are less Breaky
 
05:26:57.910 --> 05:26:57.920 align:start position:0%
spyic but all I can find is French
 
05:27:00.190 --> 05:27:00.200 align:start position:0%
Bulldogs that are currently Breaky calic
 
05:27:02.628 --> 05:27:02.638 align:start position:0%
you're have great difficulty in doing
 
05:27:05.110 --> 05:27:05.120 align:start position:0%
that and you're left with the situation
 
05:27:06.470 --> 05:27:06.480 align:start position:0%
of what's called outcrossing where you
 
05:27:08.628 --> 05:27:08.638 align:start position:0%
basically mix breeds together and try to
 
05:27:11.470 --> 05:27:11.480 align:start position:0%
change the entire shape of the dog but
 
05:27:13.788 --> 05:27:13.798 align:start position:0%
breeders I think don't want to do that
 
05:27:15.070 --> 05:27:15.080 align:start position:0%
because then they're making dogs that
 
05:27:16.948 --> 05:27:16.958 align:start position:0%
are not the breed standard and they face
 
05:27:19.510 --> 05:27:19.520 align:start position:0%
a lot of criticism from other breeders
 
05:27:21.750 --> 05:27:21.760 align:start position:0%
who then will blast them across social
 
05:27:23.868 --> 05:27:23.878 align:start position:0%
media and wherever else and say you're
 
05:27:28.110 --> 05:27:28.120 align:start position:0%
making poor examples of XYZ breed and
 
05:27:29.628 --> 05:27:29.638 align:start position:0%
they face a lot of you know peer
 
05:27:31.110 --> 05:27:31.120 align:start position:0%
pressure I I think think from what I've
 
05:27:34.910 --> 05:27:34.920 align:start position:0%
seen uh that way so and I and I think
 
05:27:37.948 --> 05:27:37.958 align:start position:0%
it's hard to hear um you know the thing
 
05:27:39.788 --> 05:27:39.798 align:start position:0%
I've been making and nurturing in my
 
05:27:41.628 --> 05:27:41.638 align:start position:0%
mind for many years and in many
 
05:27:44.390 --> 05:27:44.400 align:start position:0%
generations in my family is perhaps you
 
05:27:46.190 --> 05:27:46.200 align:start position:0%
know not in the best interest of the
 
05:27:49.510 --> 05:27:49.520 align:start position:0%
overall dog population as a whole I I
 
05:27:51.270 --> 05:27:51.280 align:start position:0%
think that's hard news to take a lot of
 
05:27:54.510 --> 05:27:54.520 align:start position:0%
the time thank you representative Murray
 
05:27:55.910 --> 05:27:55.920 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
05:27:57.548 --> 05:27:57.558 align:start position:0%
taking my question another question that
 
05:27:59.628 --> 05:27:59.638 align:start position:0%
I had was we we've spent a lot of time
 
05:28:01.190 --> 05:28:01.200 align:start position:0%
around the
 
05:28:03.990 --> 05:28:04.000 align:start position:0%
condition of brachio but are there other
 
05:28:06.190 --> 05:28:06.200 align:start position:0%
conditions that you see in treat that
 
05:28:09.230 --> 05:28:09.240 align:start position:0%
you I'm looking at the the inclusion of
 
05:28:12.390 --> 05:28:12.400 align:start position:0%
this L thank you if I may follow up
 
05:28:16.110 --> 05:28:16.120 align:start position:0%
thank you um and so how does one
 
05:28:18.230 --> 05:28:18.240 align:start position:0%
interpret if we were looking at lines
 
05:28:21.030 --> 05:28:21.040 align:start position:0%
four five and six which conditions would
 
05:28:24.150 --> 05:28:24.160 align:start position:0%
be included in addition to brachio If
 
05:28:28.470 --> 05:28:28.480 align:start position:0%
This Were to be interpreted legally uh
 
05:28:30.270 --> 05:28:30.280 align:start position:0%
you referring to the bill itself correct
 
05:28:32.910 --> 05:28:32.920 align:start position:0%
okay okay um can I see I I don't
 
05:28:35.470 --> 05:28:35.480 align:start position:0%
remember what lines four five and six
 
05:28:38.590 --> 05:28:38.600 align:start position:0%
say there copies on the table
 
05:28:40.750 --> 05:28:40.760 align:start position:0%
there I can just read it if you want
 
05:28:53.110 --> 05:28:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:56.030 --> 05:28:56.040 align:start position:0%
okay just to clarify I was asking around
 
05:28:58.868 --> 05:28:58.878 align:start position:0%
lines four five and six and the
 
05:29:00.990 --> 05:29:01.000 align:start position:0%
interpretation of
 
05:29:03.948 --> 05:29:03.958 align:start position:0%
um a birth deform formity that causes
 
05:29:06.350 --> 05:29:06.360 align:start position:0%
suffering such as and it mentions one
 
05:29:09.190 --> 05:29:09.200 align:start position:0%
condition but you are yeah I mean you
 
05:29:09.200 --> 05:29:10.150 align:start position:0%
condition but you are yeah I mean you
could

05:29:10.150 --> 05:29:10.160 align:start position:0%
could
 
05:29:14.310 --> 05:29:14.320 align:start position:0%
name many deformities you know that dogs
 
05:29:16.430 --> 05:29:16.440 align:start position:0%
suffer from as congenital malformations
 
05:29:19.868 --> 05:29:19.878 align:start position:0%
I mean hydrophilus spinal
 
05:29:23.350 --> 05:29:23.360 align:start position:0%
kyphosis uh cingo Melia and Cavaliers I
 
05:29:25.750 --> 05:29:25.760 align:start position:0%
mean there's there's I I can literally
 
05:29:27.708 --> 05:29:27.718 align:start position:0%
just you could find a book and just
 
05:29:31.030 --> 05:29:31.040 align:start position:0%
start naming them um I do you know and
 
05:29:34.190 --> 05:29:34.200 align:start position:0%
that gets into I think from you know you
 
05:29:35.708 --> 05:29:35.718 align:start position:0%
all's perspective a little bit of a
 
05:29:37.990 --> 05:29:38.000 align:start position:0%
hairy situation as far as like how to
 
05:29:39.548 --> 05:29:39.558 align:start position:0%
approve these sorts of things like why
 
05:29:42.750 --> 05:29:42.760 align:start position:0%
stop here and that sort of question um
 
05:29:44.430 --> 05:29:44.440 align:start position:0%
what I will say is that I think Breaky
 
05:29:47.110 --> 05:29:47.120 align:start position:0%
seil is probably a good starting point
 
05:29:48.590 --> 05:29:48.600 align:start position:0%
because if you pay attention to like the
 
05:29:53.150 --> 05:29:53.160 align:start position:0%
8020 rule in theory um Breaky seil I
 
05:29:55.190 --> 05:29:55.200 align:start position:0%
think is going to be responsible for
 
05:29:56.990 --> 05:29:57.000 align:start position:0%
more of the health problems than
 
05:30:00.788 --> 05:30:00.798 align:start position:0%
anything else um by and large
 
05:30:03.430 --> 05:30:03.440 align:start position:0%
um is it the single worst thing that
 
05:30:05.150 --> 05:30:05.160 align:start position:0%
could be Malou wared about a dog not
 
05:30:07.510 --> 05:30:07.520 align:start position:0%
always but the sheer number of these
 
05:30:11.070 --> 05:30:11.080 align:start position:0%
pets times how much it affects them I
 
05:30:13.230 --> 05:30:13.240 align:start position:0%
think produces a value that probably
 
05:30:16.590 --> 05:30:16.600 align:start position:0%
will be the the most um the most
 
05:30:19.590 --> 05:30:19.600 align:start position:0%
rewarding to tackle as a
 
05:30:23.190 --> 05:30:23.200 align:start position:0%
whole I represent
 
05:30:25.190 --> 05:30:25.200 align:start position:0%
ger thank you madam chair thank you for
 
05:30:26.868 --> 05:30:26.878 align:start position:0%
taking my question so I I have my kind
 
05:30:29.470 --> 05:30:29.480 align:start position:0%
of go-to vet in in my community that I
 
05:30:32.350 --> 05:30:32.360 align:start position:0%
always reach out to on these issues uh
 
05:30:34.548 --> 05:30:34.558 align:start position:0%
for for her advice and and she was very
 
05:30:37.390 --> 05:30:37.400 align:start position:0%
sympathetic to to this bill but her
 
05:30:39.788 --> 05:30:39.798 align:start position:0%
concern um that I I wish to ask you
 
05:30:42.190 --> 05:30:42.200 align:start position:0%
about has to do
 
05:30:44.430 --> 05:30:44.440 align:start position:0%
with the the part of the bill that you
 
05:30:46.030 --> 05:30:46.040 align:start position:0%
know have have in front of you that
 
05:30:49.030 --> 05:30:49.040 align:start position:0%
refers to the uh same birth deformity
 
05:30:51.230 --> 05:30:51.240 align:start position:0%
that causes suffering and the question
 
05:30:53.788 --> 05:30:53.798 align:start position:0%
of of her her concern was you know when
 
05:30:57.030 --> 05:30:57.040 align:start position:0%
she sees dogs even as they're diagnosed
 
05:30:58.750 --> 05:30:58.760 align:start position:0%
with boas it's on a scale from one to
 
05:31:03.110 --> 05:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
four right so how would you envision as
 
05:31:05.230 --> 05:31:05.240 align:start position:0%
a practicing veterinarian something like
 
05:31:07.590 --> 05:31:07.600 align:start position:0%
this being implemented because there's
 
05:31:09.628 --> 05:31:09.638 align:start position:0%
one thing to to understand the purpose
 
05:31:11.750 --> 05:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
of it it's another thing to say when
 
05:31:15.910 --> 05:31:15.920 align:start position:0%
we're trying to judge suffering as the
 
05:31:18.390 --> 05:31:18.400 align:start position:0%
qualifier for whether or not animals
 
05:31:21.230 --> 05:31:21.240 align:start position:0%
should be bred um how in your mind might
 
05:31:22.390 --> 05:31:22.400 align:start position:0%
something like this actually be
 
05:31:24.990 --> 05:31:25.000 align:start position:0%
implemented um I would use the uh I
 
05:31:27.190 --> 05:31:27.200 align:start position:0%
believe it was out of the Cambridge uh
 
05:31:30.628 --> 05:31:30.638 align:start position:0%
the Boaz grading skill um and and
 
05:31:32.110 --> 05:31:32.120 align:start position:0%
basically I think the guidelines
 
05:31:34.548 --> 05:31:34.558 align:start position:0%
overseas is to breed only grade zero or
 
05:31:38.190 --> 05:31:38.200 align:start position:0%
one dogs together um and I I think that
 
05:31:40.190 --> 05:31:40.200 align:start position:0%
is a good guideline to start with
 
05:31:42.270 --> 05:31:42.280 align:start position:0%
however as a neurologist I'm a little
 
05:31:44.670 --> 05:31:44.680 align:start position:0%
bit biased because you know I actually
 
05:31:47.270 --> 05:31:47.280 align:start position:0%
don't um I only deal with the the
 
05:31:49.510 --> 05:31:49.520 align:start position:0%
neurologic aspect of these breeds which
 
05:31:52.628 --> 05:31:52.638 align:start position:0%
I see almost every day and I do think
 
05:31:55.110 --> 05:31:55.120 align:start position:0%
that the dishevel 2 variant in these
 
05:31:57.830 --> 05:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
breeds does not get talked about enough
 
05:32:00.510 --> 05:32:00.520 align:start position:0%
um Studies have shown that this is fixed
 
05:32:02.708 --> 05:32:02.718 align:start position:0%
in French English bulldogs and I believe
 
05:32:05.868 --> 05:32:05.878 align:start position:0%
Boston ter or pugs don't not but
 
05:32:08.628 --> 05:32:08.638 align:start position:0%
definitely French and English Bulldogs
 
05:32:11.990 --> 05:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
um I I think ridding the breed of also
 
05:32:14.030 --> 05:32:14.040 align:start position:0%
that spinal Mal formation is equally as
 
05:32:16.390 --> 05:32:16.400 align:start position:0%
important as as ridding them of this
 
05:32:19.350 --> 05:32:19.360 align:start position:0%
Boaz prevalence it's very helpful thank
 
05:32:20.628 --> 05:32:20.638 align:start position:0%
you thank
 
05:32:22.910 --> 05:32:22.920 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
05:32:25.270 --> 05:32:25.280 align:start position:0%
kraton thank thank you madam chair and
 
05:32:27.350 --> 05:32:27.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony I'm going
 
05:32:29.230 --> 05:32:29.240 align:start position:0%
to put you in the fight right now in the
 
05:32:31.350 --> 05:32:31.360 align:start position:0%
family my daughter's is a vet and one of
 
05:32:34.230 --> 05:32:34.240 align:start position:0%
my best friends is a vet and they're on
 
05:32:36.990 --> 05:32:37.000 align:start position:0%
both sides of this issue sure
 
05:32:39.670 --> 05:32:39.680 align:start position:0%
so ask you a question real quick are are
 
05:32:41.430 --> 05:32:41.440 align:start position:0%
they on the side that the bill just has
 
05:32:43.030 --> 05:32:43.040 align:start position:0%
faulty language or are they on the side
 
05:32:45.350 --> 05:32:45.360 align:start position:0%
that breakie se is okay my daughter 45
 
05:32:47.990 --> 05:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
minutes RI my ear off it's got to pass
 
05:32:49.670 --> 05:32:49.680 align:start position:0%
is it's got to pass it's got to pass
 
05:32:52.190 --> 05:32:52.200 align:start position:0%
pass it will not pass my best friend was
 
05:32:55.830 --> 05:32:55.840 align:start position:0%
it can't pass okay so yeah here I am
 
05:32:58.868 --> 05:32:58.878 align:start position:0%
here you are um my question though is
 
05:33:01.788 --> 05:33:01.798 align:start position:0%
really to
 
05:33:04.270 --> 05:33:04.280 align:start position:0%
the concept that
 
05:33:07.270 --> 05:33:07.280 align:start position:0%
breeders can take care of this right
 
05:33:10.110 --> 05:33:10.120 align:start position:0%
that's that's the argument from the the
 
05:33:12.510 --> 05:33:12.520 align:start position:0%
vet that said leave it alone right I I
 
05:33:15.470 --> 05:33:15.480 align:start position:0%
think the the best answer to that is
 
05:33:17.510 --> 05:33:17.520 align:start position:0%
just look at the breed standards the
 
05:33:20.868 --> 05:33:20.878 align:start position:0%
breed standards show and they call for
 
05:33:23.470 --> 05:33:23.480 align:start position:0%
dogs with extremely short noses if that
 
05:33:26.310 --> 05:33:26.320 align:start position:0%
is your North Star to create a dog
 
05:33:28.548 --> 05:33:28.558 align:start position:0%
you're going to create dogs as extremely
 
05:33:30.590 --> 05:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
short noosed as you can
 
05:33:33.628 --> 05:33:33.638 align:start position:0%
as part of building this population and
 
05:33:35.310 --> 05:33:35.320 align:start position:0%
if you're going to do that
 
05:33:38.590 --> 05:33:38.600 align:start position:0%
yes very many will overcome that
 
05:33:40.910 --> 05:33:40.920 align:start position:0%
disability like I said in my statement
 
05:33:42.310 --> 05:33:42.320 align:start position:0%
but you're going to have collateral
 
05:33:44.788 --> 05:33:44.798 align:start position:0%
damage in the form of just swaths of
 
05:33:48.548 --> 05:33:48.558 align:start position:0%
dogs as a result of this practice that
 
05:33:52.270 --> 05:33:52.280 align:start position:0%
are suffering from sometimes day one
 
05:33:56.030 --> 05:33:56.040 align:start position:0%
okay um and I I think one of the biggest
 
05:33:57.670 --> 05:33:57.680 align:start position:0%
things that could change would be the
 
05:34:00.470 --> 05:34:00.480 align:start position:0%
breed clubs changing the language and
 
05:34:02.788 --> 05:34:02.798 align:start position:0%
stop I think what the AKC rep was
 
05:34:04.510 --> 05:34:04.520 align:start position:0%
talking about Boston teror breed
 
05:34:06.548 --> 05:34:06.558 align:start position:0%
standard you can you can look it up
 
05:34:08.708 --> 05:34:08.718 align:start position:0%
right now the breed standard shows a
 
05:34:10.910 --> 05:34:10.920 align:start position:0%
correct Breaky spalet dog and an
 
05:34:13.110 --> 05:34:13.120 align:start position:0%
incorrect less Breaky calic dog the
 
05:34:15.430 --> 05:34:15.440 align:start position:0%
muzzle is longer and they call it
 
05:34:17.430 --> 05:34:17.440 align:start position:0%
incorrect so if you're a breeder and you
 
05:34:19.110 --> 05:34:19.120 align:start position:0%
want to make these dogs you're going to
 
05:34:21.070 --> 05:34:21.080 align:start position:0%
look at that and think well I want to
 
05:34:23.548 --> 05:34:23.558 align:start position:0%
make the correct one but that means
 
05:34:25.190 --> 05:34:25.200 align:start position:0%
everything's going like this with the
 
05:34:27.430 --> 05:34:27.440 align:start position:0%
muzzle so I think that's probably the
 
05:34:29.230 --> 05:34:29.240 align:start position:0%
best place to start okay thank you so
 
05:34:30.750 --> 05:34:30.760 align:start position:0%
much appreciate it
 
05:34:33.670 --> 05:34:33.680 align:start position:0%
yep U representative
 
05:34:37.150 --> 05:34:37.160 align:start position:0%
Penza um I love representative um
 
05:34:39.150 --> 05:34:39.160 align:start position:0%
kraton's question because it's kind of
 
05:34:41.470 --> 05:34:41.480 align:start position:0%
like where I'm at how can we legislate
 
05:34:44.948 --> 05:34:44.958 align:start position:0%
this I think it's almost impossible but
 
05:34:47.788 --> 05:34:47.798 align:start position:0%
um the other the two other um the woman
 
05:34:50.350 --> 05:34:50.360 align:start position:0%
from the AKC and then the other woman
 
05:34:51.948 --> 05:34:51.958 align:start position:0%
that's sitting next to her um their
 
05:34:54.190 --> 05:34:54.200 align:start position:0%
testimonies were really powerful so and
 
05:34:57.150 --> 05:34:57.160 align:start position:0%
I'm here looking at this chart that has
 
05:34:59.510 --> 05:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
you know says okay if we want to not
 
05:34:59.520 --> 05:35:00.708 align:start position:0%
you know says okay if we want to not
have

05:35:00.708 --> 05:35:00.718 align:start position:0%
have
 
05:35:04.030 --> 05:35:04.040 align:start position:0%
um you know the the boas problem this is
 
05:35:05.190 --> 05:35:05.200 align:start position:0%
where you would
 
05:35:08.190 --> 05:35:08.200 align:start position:0%
breed so you're saying is this not being
 
05:35:11.190 --> 05:35:11.200 align:start position:0%
followed by the Breeders right now I
 
05:35:12.990 --> 05:35:13.000 align:start position:0%
think it's contradictory because
 
05:35:15.470 --> 05:35:15.480 align:start position:0%
research has also shown that the shorter
 
05:35:18.270 --> 05:35:18.280 align:start position:0%
that a muzzle gets the higher the risk
 
05:35:21.110 --> 05:35:21.120 align:start position:0%
exponentially of Boaz happening that is
 
05:35:23.548 --> 05:35:23.558 align:start position:0%
that is disputed amongst the Breeders
 
05:35:25.750 --> 05:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
but that and another study is
 
05:35:27.470 --> 05:35:27.480 align:start position:0%
misinterpreted as counteracting the
 
05:35:29.270 --> 05:35:29.280 align:start position:0%
study that showed a very clear
 
05:35:31.190 --> 05:35:31.200 align:start position:0%
relationship across all dogs as the
 
05:35:33.070 --> 05:35:33.080 align:start position:0%
muzzle goes like this the risk of Boaz
 
05:35:36.670 --> 05:35:36.680 align:start position:0%
goes like that on a graph okay um I
 
05:35:38.628 --> 05:35:38.638 align:start position:0%
think it's it's contradictory because on
 
05:35:40.510 --> 05:35:40.520 align:start position:0%
the one hand they're encouraging that
 
05:35:42.190 --> 05:35:42.200 align:start position:0%
but then they show you a picture of a
 
05:35:45.830 --> 05:35:45.840 align:start position:0%
dog with no nose on their breed standard
 
05:35:48.270 --> 05:35:48.280 align:start position:0%
website so I I don't know how to make
 
05:35:52.150 --> 05:35:52.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:54.230 --> 05:35:54.240 align:start position:0%
you sure wouldn't followup
 
05:35:57.150 --> 05:35:57.160 align:start position:0%
representative Katon and H yes thank you
 
05:35:59.750 --> 05:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
one one question this is clarification
 
05:36:00.590 --> 05:36:00.600 align:start position:0%
because we've
 
05:36:04.070 --> 05:36:04.080 align:start position:0%
had to me conflicting testimony today on
 
05:36:06.150 --> 05:36:06.160 align:start position:0%
the definition of
 
05:36:10.190 --> 05:36:10.200 align:start position:0%
brachio Breaky s Breaky yes sir thank
 
05:36:13.430 --> 05:36:13.440 align:start position:0%
you uh as a medical condition or just a
 
05:36:15.110 --> 05:36:15.120 align:start position:0%
description of a flat face it's a
 
05:36:18.150 --> 05:36:18.160 align:start position:0%
description of of the skull okay and
 
05:36:20.190 --> 05:36:20.200 align:start position:0%
that description it's like saying round
 
05:36:22.948 --> 05:36:22.958 align:start position:0%
like how round is something okay right
 
05:36:22.958 --> 05:36:26.708 align:start position:0%
like how round is something okay right
thank

05:36:26.708 --> 05:36:26.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:30.070 --> 05:36:30.080 align:start position:0%
you okay any other questions thank you
 
05:36:32.070 --> 05:36:32.080 align:start position:0%
for your testimony sir yep oh
 
05:36:34.910 --> 05:36:34.920 align:start position:0%
representative kto I'm sorry thank you
 
05:36:36.510 --> 05:36:36.520 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you for taking my
 
05:36:39.110 --> 05:36:39.120 align:start position:0%
question sorry as I sit here and listen
 
05:36:41.830 --> 05:36:41.840 align:start position:0%
and I listen to and representative Katon
 
05:36:43.590 --> 05:36:43.600 align:start position:0%
just clarified one thing along with your
 
05:36:46.310 --> 05:36:46.320 align:start position:0%
answer Breaky calic is a description it
 
05:36:49.990 --> 05:36:50.000 align:start position:0%
is not a medical condition Brey spalc
 
05:36:52.350 --> 05:36:52.360 align:start position:0%
Brey is that correct
 
05:36:56.670 --> 05:36:56.680 align:start position:0%
yes may I I just heard testimony and I
 
05:36:58.590 --> 05:36:58.600 align:start position:0%
don't know if it's correct but the breed
 
05:37:00.350 --> 05:37:00.360 align:start position:0%
uh pinies
 
05:37:03.030 --> 05:37:03.040 align:start position:0%
um was discussed briefly and that
 
05:37:04.910 --> 05:37:04.920 align:start position:0%
standard hasn't my understanding was
 
05:37:09.110 --> 05:37:09.120 align:start position:0%
it's over a thousand years old
 
05:37:12.390 --> 05:37:12.400 align:start position:0%
um but they would be considered Breaky
 
05:37:16.948 --> 05:37:16.958 align:start position:0%
spal right I believe they are yes okay
 
05:37:21.910 --> 05:37:21.920 align:start position:0%
now how would we why would we legislate
 
05:37:24.110 --> 05:37:24.120 align:start position:0%
something on a breed that is over a
 
05:37:26.750 --> 05:37:26.760 align:start position:0%
thousand years old that we haven't heard
 
05:37:29.948 --> 05:37:29.958 align:start position:0%
anything going on with regards to I mean
 
05:37:32.150 --> 05:37:32.160 align:start position:0%
we've been talking about a lot of breeds
 
05:37:34.830 --> 05:37:34.840 align:start position:0%
but Pines is also one of these
 
05:37:37.628 --> 05:37:37.638 align:start position:0%
breeds what is your suggestion and what
 
05:37:40.910 --> 05:37:40.920 align:start position:0%
do we do with all of these animals if we
 
05:37:43.390 --> 05:37:43.400 align:start position:0%
going to legislate that these people
 
05:37:45.830 --> 05:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
really can't read again because they're
 
05:37:48.110 --> 05:37:48.120 align:start position:0%
causing they're a Breaky calic breed I'm
 
05:37:51.830 --> 05:37:51.840 align:start position:0%
just asking well I think that if you
 
05:37:54.390 --> 05:37:54.400 align:start position:0%
start the question is how it like in a
 
05:37:56.548 --> 05:37:56.558 align:start position:0%
theoretical world how to start this
 
05:37:59.270 --> 05:37:59.280 align:start position:0%
process of unwinding the severe extreme
 
05:37:59.280 --> 05:38:00.868 align:start position:0%
process of unwinding the severe extreme
Fe

05:38:00.868 --> 05:38:00.878 align:start position:0%
Fe
 
05:38:03.030 --> 05:38:03.040 align:start position:0%
um I would think there would have to be
 
05:38:05.110 --> 05:38:05.120 align:start position:0%
some sort of grace period to say okay
 
05:38:06.990 --> 05:38:07.000 align:start position:0%
you have X amount of time to start
 
05:38:10.150 --> 05:38:10.160 align:start position:0%
unwinding this process so that you know
 
05:38:12.070 --> 05:38:12.080 align:start position:0%
initially all we have are break ealc
 
05:38:13.708 --> 05:38:13.718 align:start position:0%
dogs in many cases so like what else are
 
05:38:15.830 --> 05:38:15.840 align:start position:0%
we going to breed them to right so I
 
05:38:18.590 --> 05:38:18.600 align:start position:0%
think they need time to demonstrate you
 
05:38:20.788 --> 05:38:20.798 align:start position:0%
know are we making progress and Headway
 
05:38:23.708 --> 05:38:23.718 align:start position:0%
here um and I think a lot of good faith
 
05:38:25.670 --> 05:38:25.680 align:start position:0%
as I've said before a lot of kind of
 
05:38:27.110 --> 05:38:27.120 align:start position:0%
good faith towards that would be the
 
05:38:28.830 --> 05:38:28.840 align:start position:0%
breed clubs changing what they are
 
05:38:30.670 --> 05:38:30.680 align:start position:0%
recommending and showing as primary
 
05:38:33.868 --> 05:38:33.878 align:start position:0%
examples of these pets um I'd also like
 
05:38:35.110 --> 05:38:35.120 align:start position:0%
to bring up the fact that there's
 
05:38:37.868 --> 05:38:37.878 align:start position:0%
there's varying degrees of break eil so
 
05:38:39.788 --> 05:38:39.798 align:start position:0%
like some people mention boxers as a
 
05:38:41.788 --> 05:38:41.798 align:start position:0%
breed and lump them in with French and
 
05:38:43.190 --> 05:38:43.200 align:start position:0%
English bulldogs and say Well they're
 
05:38:45.030 --> 05:38:45.040 align:start position:0%
break EOP valid why they don't have
 
05:38:47.468 --> 05:38:47.478 align:start position:0%
these if you look at boxers how many
 
05:38:49.310 --> 05:38:49.320 align:start position:0%
boxers have you seen who have completely
 
05:38:52.590 --> 05:38:52.600 align:start position:0%
no face whatsoever there there's degrees
 
05:38:54.150 --> 05:38:54.160 align:start position:0%
to this condition too and that's why I
 
05:38:55.750 --> 05:38:55.760 align:start position:0%
use the analogy that it's like calling
 
05:38:58.230 --> 05:38:58.240 align:start position:0%
something round because you know a
 
05:39:00.990 --> 05:39:01.000 align:start position:0%
soccer ball is not a perfect sphere but
 
05:39:03.030 --> 05:39:03.040 align:start position:0%
you would describe it as round in
 
05:39:07.670 --> 05:39:07.680 align:start position:0%
general right um having said that boxers
 
05:39:10.830 --> 05:39:10.840 align:start position:0%
are a much elevated risk for malignant
 
05:39:12.390 --> 05:39:12.400 align:start position:0%
brain cancer and that is directly
 
05:39:14.670 --> 05:39:14.680 align:start position:0%
related to the genes that confer brachy
 
05:39:17.510 --> 05:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
onto them so the genes that change the
 
05:39:19.830 --> 05:39:19.840 align:start position:0%
shape of their skull have other
 
05:39:21.548 --> 05:39:21.558 align:start position:0%
ramifications outside of just their
 
05:39:25.230 --> 05:39:25.240 align:start position:0%
respiratory system represent kto thank
 
05:39:27.230 --> 05:39:27.240 align:start position:0%
you but couldn't that be true of any
 
05:39:31.788 --> 05:39:31.798 align:start position:0%
breed uh true of well I mean any breed
 
05:39:35.670 --> 05:39:35.680 align:start position:0%
can pass on uh genetic or uh or
 
05:39:39.390 --> 05:39:39.400 align:start position:0%
deformity um I know that at one point I
 
05:39:41.310 --> 05:39:41.320 align:start position:0%
had a breed I had to make sure I got a
 
05:39:44.590 --> 05:39:44.600 align:start position:0%
hip displasia um certificate uh to say
 
05:39:45.990 --> 05:39:46.000 align:start position:0%
that they were free and clear of that
 
05:39:48.150 --> 05:39:48.160 align:start position:0%
and that my dog would replace because it
 
05:39:50.670 --> 05:39:50.680 align:start position:0%
is a genetic deformity or genetic defect
 
05:39:52.948 --> 05:39:52.958 align:start position:0%
in that particular breed it was my
 
05:39:55.468 --> 05:39:55.478 align:start position:0%
choice to buy from the breeder who I
 
05:39:57.628 --> 05:39:57.638 align:start position:0%
thought was very upfront and honest with
 
05:39:59.910 --> 05:39:59.920 align:start position:0%
me and I had a wonderful animal right
 
05:40:00.990 --> 05:40:01.000 align:start position:0%
there are other breeds that are
 
05:40:04.468 --> 05:40:04.478 align:start position:0%
subjective to cancer genes now what
 
05:40:07.150 --> 05:40:07.160 align:start position:0%
specific cancer Gene well you know
 
05:40:09.468 --> 05:40:09.478 align:start position:0%
things we I'm not sure I'm not a
 
05:40:13.030 --> 05:40:13.040 align:start position:0%
veterinarian but G genetically even as
 
05:40:16.270 --> 05:40:16.280 align:start position:0%
humans we are predisposed by our parents
 
05:40:20.350 --> 05:40:20.360 align:start position:0%
okay to get genetic defects or abnor
 
05:40:22.430 --> 05:40:22.440 align:start position:0%
abnormalities this can happen in any
 
05:40:26.190 --> 05:40:26.200 align:start position:0%
breed of dog not just the braisy so what
 
05:40:29.948 --> 05:40:29.958 align:start position:0%
is your answer to um comat combating all
 
05:40:31.670 --> 05:40:31.680 align:start position:0%
of these well for one I think this is a
 
05:40:34.430 --> 05:40:34.440 align:start position:0%
false equivalency I don't think that
 
05:40:37.350 --> 05:40:37.360 align:start position:0%
referring to other breeds like um let's
 
05:40:40.628 --> 05:40:40.638 align:start position:0%
say Bernie Mountain Dogs and they're
 
05:40:42.708 --> 05:40:42.718 align:start position:0%
massively overrepresented for a
 
05:40:45.350 --> 05:40:45.360 align:start position:0%
malignant cancer that is incurable and
 
05:40:46.910 --> 05:40:46.920 align:start position:0%
their lifespan in some studies are
 
05:40:49.070 --> 05:40:49.080 align:start position:0%
reported as six to eight years they die
 
05:40:50.868 --> 05:40:50.878 align:start position:0%
of this called his malignant
 
05:40:54.150 --> 05:40:54.160 align:start position:0%
histiocytosis okay
 
05:40:57.910 --> 05:40:57.920 align:start position:0%
um that cancer if you could identify a
 
05:41:01.670 --> 05:41:01.680 align:start position:0%
single genetic test to say okay this dog
 
05:41:05.110 --> 05:41:05.120 align:start position:0%
is going to demonstrate this cancer I
 
05:41:07.110 --> 05:41:07.120 align:start position:0%
promise you everybody would be on board
 
05:41:08.750 --> 05:41:08.760 align:start position:0%
with saying okay yeah let's get get this
 
05:41:10.430 --> 05:41:10.440 align:start position:0%
out of the breed the problem is you
 
05:41:12.070 --> 05:41:12.080 align:start position:0%
cannot at least to my knowledge
 
05:41:14.030 --> 05:41:14.040 align:start position:0%
currently do that and you have to wait
 
05:41:15.750 --> 05:41:15.760 align:start position:0%
until the dog is about 7 or eight years
 
05:41:17.830 --> 05:41:17.840 align:start position:0%
old to develop the cancer many times
 
05:41:19.788 --> 05:41:19.798 align:start position:0%
they develop these problems after
 
05:41:22.708 --> 05:41:22.718 align:start position:0%
they've reproduced okay whereas many of
 
05:41:25.548 --> 05:41:25.558 align:start position:0%
these dogs who are Brey calic will
 
05:41:27.390 --> 05:41:27.400 align:start position:0%
demonstrate these problems before they
 
05:41:30.910 --> 05:41:30.920 align:start position:0%
reproduce or they are simply born with a
 
05:41:33.030 --> 05:41:33.040 align:start position:0%
shape that we know puts them at risk for
 
05:41:37.390 --> 05:41:37.400 align:start position:0%
it okay um so again I I think the
 
05:41:41.110 --> 05:41:41.120 align:start position:0%
question is what can we identify to fix
 
05:41:42.628 --> 05:41:42.638 align:start position:0%
and you mentioned the grading the Boaz
 
05:41:44.910 --> 05:41:44.920 align:start position:0%
grading scale and you know simply
 
05:41:49.708 --> 05:41:49.718 align:start position:0%
visually inspecting um the the two uh uh
 
05:41:51.948 --> 05:41:51.958 align:start position:0%
parents of any potential Offspring I
 
05:41:53.750 --> 05:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
think would be you know much easier than
 
05:41:57.150 --> 05:41:57.160 align:start position:0%
trying to say um you know are these dogs
 
05:41:58.670 --> 05:41:58.680 align:start position:0%
going to end up producing cancer in
 
05:42:00.670 --> 05:42:00.680 align:start position:0%
eight years after they're
 
05:42:02.750 --> 05:42:02.760 align:start position:0%
born representative
 
05:42:04.948 --> 05:42:04.958 align:start position:0%
Bixby yeah so one of the things I'm
 
05:42:08.150 --> 05:42:08.160 align:start position:0%
struggling with is that um we have
 
05:42:11.350 --> 05:42:11.360 align:start position:0%
before us two different things we have a
 
05:42:14.390 --> 05:42:14.400 align:start position:0%
problem which you have documented fairly
 
05:42:19.468 --> 05:42:19.478 align:start position:0%
well that uh there are uh there are
 
05:42:19.478 --> 05:42:21.310 align:start position:0%
well that uh there are uh there are
certain

05:42:21.310 --> 05:42:21.320 align:start position:0%
certain
 
05:42:26.510 --> 05:42:26.520 align:start position:0%
uh certain um diseases uh that or um
 
05:42:29.990 --> 05:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
physiological um uh problems that come
 
05:42:34.350 --> 05:42:34.360 align:start position:0%
with brais phalic dogs uh not 100% but
 
05:42:36.788 --> 05:42:36.798 align:start position:0%
you know with a certain degree of
 
05:42:38.830 --> 05:42:38.840 align:start position:0%
predictability and we also have before
 
05:42:43.150 --> 05:42:43.160 align:start position:0%
us a bill and what the bill does is uh
 
05:42:46.350 --> 05:42:46.360 align:start position:0%
make the selling or breeding of such
 
05:42:51.230 --> 05:42:51.240 align:start position:0%
dogs uh and animal cruelty of an
 
05:42:55.830 --> 05:42:55.840 align:start position:0%
equivalent to um neg negligently failing
 
05:43:00.070 --> 05:43:00.080 align:start position:0%
to feed your animals uh or
 
05:43:02.230 --> 05:43:02.240 align:start position:0%
negligently um you know causing other
 
05:43:03.750 --> 05:43:03.760 align:start position:0%
sorts of suffering to your animals I'm
 
05:43:05.230 --> 05:43:05.240 align:start position:0%
not going to go through the whole list
 
05:43:09.830 --> 05:43:09.840 align:start position:0%
but but so what we're looking at is uh
 
05:43:13.788 --> 05:43:13.798 align:start position:0%
something a list of Cruelty behaviors
 
05:43:18.548 --> 05:43:18.558 align:start position:0%
that are generally policed by local law
 
05:43:21.270 --> 05:43:21.280 align:start position:0%
enforcement or local Animal Control
 
05:43:26.708 --> 05:43:26.718 align:start position:0%
Officers and are um and I'm wondering
 
05:43:31.030 --> 05:43:31.040 align:start position:0%
how that the enforcement system that uh
 
05:43:33.310 --> 05:43:33.320 align:start position:0%
we have for someone who is hoarding
 
05:43:37.030 --> 05:43:37.040 align:start position:0%
animals is going to be the same be
 
05:43:40.510 --> 05:43:40.520 align:start position:0%
effective for uh for dealing with
 
05:43:43.590 --> 05:43:43.600 align:start position:0%
problems that have to do with let's say
 
05:43:46.230 --> 05:43:46.240 align:start position:0%
errors of judgment and breeding or
 
05:43:50.468 --> 05:43:50.478 align:start position:0%
errors of um in systemic practice in
 
05:43:52.430 --> 05:43:52.440 align:start position:0%
breeding I'm not I'm not sure how this
 
05:43:54.708 --> 05:43:54.718 align:start position:0%
bill is actually going to
 
05:43:57.750 --> 05:43:57.760 align:start position:0%
effectively address what is a seems to
 
05:44:01.190 --> 05:44:01.200 align:start position:0%
be a systemic problem in uh the in
 
05:44:03.750 --> 05:44:03.760 align:start position:0%
patterns of breeding yeah no I I agree
 
05:44:07.708 --> 05:44:07.718 align:start position:0%
like that that's um that's more of
 
05:44:09.990 --> 05:44:10.000 align:start position:0%
a sound crass there more of a you
 
05:44:13.270 --> 05:44:13.280 align:start position:0%
problem than a my problem you know um
 
05:44:15.868 --> 05:44:15.878 align:start position:0%
but uh no I I I hear what you're saying
 
05:44:17.750 --> 05:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
that that makes perfect sense like how
 
05:44:20.548 --> 05:44:20.558 align:start position:0%
do we use what we have now to enforce
 
05:44:24.788 --> 05:44:24.798 align:start position:0%
this um I would say I would not rely on
 
05:44:26.430 --> 05:44:26.440 align:start position:0%
anything other than a
 
05:44:28.590 --> 05:44:28.600 align:start position:0%
veterinarian and if you really want to
 
05:44:30.948 --> 05:44:30.958 align:start position:0%
be precise and fair and balanced you
 
05:44:32.548 --> 05:44:32.558 align:start position:0%
should have a specialist veterinarian
 
05:44:34.350 --> 05:44:34.360 align:start position:0%
such as a board certified surgeon or an
 
05:44:35.788 --> 05:44:35.798 align:start position:0%
internist or an
 
05:44:37.628 --> 05:44:37.638 align:start position:0%
anesthesiologist um
 
05:44:40.070 --> 05:44:40.080 align:start position:0%
neurologist um one of these types of
 
05:44:43.708 --> 05:44:43.718 align:start position:0%
people assess potential breed stock and
 
05:44:45.350 --> 05:44:45.360 align:start position:0%
make that conclusion and you probably
 
05:44:48.628 --> 05:44:48.638 align:start position:0%
should wait until a certain age um to
 
05:44:52.350 --> 05:44:52.360 align:start position:0%
assess them in the first place follow up
 
05:44:56.868 --> 05:44:56.878 align:start position:0%
followup y um so um I don't know if this
 
05:45:00.468 --> 05:45:00.478 align:start position:0%
is even within the realm possibility but
 
05:45:03.270 --> 05:45:03.280 align:start position:0%
would it make more sense rather than
 
05:45:06.390 --> 05:45:06.400 align:start position:0%
having this in the criminal code to uh
 
05:45:10.150 --> 05:45:10.160 align:start position:0%
impose some sort of legal regulation on
 
05:45:13.070 --> 05:45:13.080 align:start position:0%
the way that breed standards are created
 
05:45:16.230 --> 05:45:16.240 align:start position:0%
um I I think that's a decent idea yeah
 
05:45:18.670 --> 05:45:18.680 align:start position:0%
yeah I could I could see I could I could
 
05:45:21.350 --> 05:45:21.360 align:start position:0%
get my head around that yeah thank you
 
05:45:23.510 --> 05:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
any other
 
05:45:26.948 --> 05:45:26.958 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none I'm going to move
 
05:45:29.150 --> 05:45:29.160 align:start position:0%
along here and uh thank you for your
 
05:45:57.788 --> 05:45:57.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:57.798 --> 05:46:14.030 align:start position:0%
 
Ferrari

05:46:14.030 --> 05:46:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:15.910 --> 05:46:15.920 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Madam chair members of
 
05:46:18.150 --> 05:46:18.160 align:start position:0%
the committee thank you for taking uh
 
05:46:20.190 --> 05:46:20.200 align:start position:0%
the time out of your day to hear our
 
05:46:22.390 --> 05:46:22.400 align:start position:0%
opposition to this Bill I'm here on
 
05:46:24.350 --> 05:46:24.360 align:start position:0%
behalf of dog owners of the Granite
 
05:46:26.830 --> 05:46:26.840 align:start position:0%
State um and I know I've explained to
 
05:46:28.868 --> 05:46:28.878 align:start position:0%
you our organization before but we
 
05:46:31.310 --> 05:46:31.320 align:start position:0%
present a wide variety of breeders and
 
05:46:33.830 --> 05:46:33.840 align:start position:0%
clubs throughout New Hampshire including
 
05:46:36.510 --> 05:46:36.520 align:start position:0%
cats and dogs um I'm going to touch on a
 
05:46:39.390 --> 05:46:39.400 align:start position:0%
few things today um I'm going to run
 
05:46:40.628 --> 05:46:40.638 align:start position:0%
through them really quick increased
 
05:46:43.150 --> 05:46:43.160 align:start position:0%
seizure of dogs undermine significance
 
05:46:45.310 --> 05:46:45.320 align:start position:0%
of Health certificates and the P
 
05:46:47.708 --> 05:46:47.718 align:start position:0%
potential for legal conflicts if you
 
05:46:49.070 --> 05:46:49.080 align:start position:0%
have questions on those if I don't get
 
05:46:50.910 --> 05:46:50.920 align:start position:0%
to them let me know I'm going to touch
 
05:46:52.510 --> 05:46:52.520 align:start position:0%
on really quickly a few things we've
 
05:46:54.548 --> 05:46:54.558 align:start position:0%
heard come up today to try and clarify
 
05:46:57.628 --> 05:46:57.638 align:start position:0%
for you um first I would like to say
 
05:46:59.990 --> 05:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
that we are all very sympathetic to
 
05:47:02.750 --> 05:47:02.760 align:start position:0%
Penny's story um we don't discount what
 
05:47:04.670 --> 05:47:04.680 align:start position:0%
she has gone through with her dog in any
 
05:47:07.468 --> 05:47:07.478 align:start position:0%
way what I do want to remind all of us
 
05:47:09.430 --> 05:47:09.440 align:start position:0%
is that she purchased her dog from a
 
05:47:12.230 --> 05:47:12.240 align:start position:0%
breeder in Ohio and we are here today to
 
05:47:15.510 --> 05:47:15.520 align:start position:0%
talk about the breeders of bralic dogs
 
05:47:18.070 --> 05:47:18.080 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire and identifying if
 
05:47:20.150 --> 05:47:20.160 align:start position:0%
we have an issue here that our
 
05:47:22.430 --> 05:47:22.440 align:start position:0%
legislator need legislation needs to
 
05:47:25.190 --> 05:47:25.200 align:start position:0%
address which I think we have heard so
 
05:47:28.868 --> 05:47:28.878 align:start position:0%
far we do not um based on Stacy over
 
05:47:31.070 --> 05:47:31.080 align:start position:0%
from the akc's testimony on what was
 
05:47:32.708 --> 05:47:32.718 align:start position:0%
submitted for complaints to the
 
05:47:35.030 --> 05:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
department we have not had any in
 
05:47:37.868 --> 05:47:37.878 align:start position:0%
regards to bopic dogs and I think that's
 
05:47:39.590 --> 05:47:39.600 align:start position:0%
really important when we're starting to
 
05:47:42.150 --> 05:47:42.160 align:start position:0%
look at making it a criminal offense or
 
05:47:44.230 --> 05:47:44.240 align:start position:0%
requiring other restrictions based on
 
05:47:47.708 --> 05:47:47.718 align:start position:0%
the breeding of those dogs so please
 
05:47:50.150 --> 05:47:50.160 align:start position:0%
keep in mind that that's why we're here
 
05:47:52.270 --> 05:47:52.280 align:start position:0%
quickly to the color question that we
 
05:47:54.390 --> 05:47:54.400 align:start position:0%
had earlier uh one piece that didn't get
 
05:47:56.150 --> 05:47:56.160 align:start position:0%
addressed is that there are non-standard
 
05:47:58.670 --> 05:47:58.680 align:start position:0%
colors and those are signs that bre
 
05:48:00.110 --> 05:48:00.120 align:start position:0%
breeders are not breeding to the
 
05:48:02.628 --> 05:48:02.638 align:start position:0%
standard and that's a red flag so that's
 
05:48:04.750 --> 05:48:04.760 align:start position:0%
could be something like a Merl Frenchie
 
05:48:07.150 --> 05:48:07.160 align:start position:0%
if you see that that isn't a breeder
 
05:48:09.390 --> 05:48:09.400 align:start position:0%
that you want to buy from additionally
 
05:48:12.430 --> 05:48:12.440 align:start position:0%
on insurance true panion offers coverage
 
05:48:15.110 --> 05:48:15.120 align:start position:0%
from day one on go home day and I'm not
 
05:48:17.628 --> 05:48:17.638 align:start position:0%
aware of any restrictions based on breed
 
05:48:19.548 --> 05:48:19.558 align:start position:0%
all right moving forward into my actual
 
05:48:21.788 --> 05:48:21.798 align:start position:0%
testimony uh in the event that breeding
 
05:48:23.310 --> 05:48:23.320 align:start position:0%
these type of dogs is officially
 
05:48:25.628 --> 05:48:25.638 align:start position:0%
classified as animal cruelty it would
 
05:48:28.150 --> 05:48:28.160 align:start position:0%
Empower officers of duly licensed Humane
 
05:48:31.030 --> 05:48:31.040 align:start position:0%
Society to intervene by taking such
 
05:48:32.750 --> 05:48:32.760 align:start position:0%
animals into temporary protective
 
05:48:35.590 --> 05:48:35.600 align:start position:0%
custody upon probable cause of Cruelty
 
05:48:37.990 --> 05:48:38.000 align:start position:0%
by the owners this provision while
 
05:48:40.190 --> 05:48:40.200 align:start position:0%
intended to protect the wellbe being of
 
05:48:42.230 --> 05:48:42.240 align:start position:0%
animals also poses challenges for dog
 
05:48:44.830 --> 05:48:44.840 align:start position:0%
breeders and prospective pet owners if
 
05:48:48.788 --> 05:48:48.798 align:start position:0%
you were to look to RSA 644 colon 8
 
05:48:53.030 --> 05:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral 4- a and a in parentheses
 
05:48:55.750 --> 05:48:55.760 align:start position:0%
where it states that an officer of a
 
05:48:57.670 --> 05:48:57.680 align:start position:0%
duly licensed Humane Society may take
 
05:48:59.628 --> 05:48:59.638 align:start position:0%
into temporary prote itive custody any
 
05:49:01.670 --> 05:49:01.680 align:start position:0%
animal when there is probable cause to
 
05:49:04.628 --> 05:49:04.638 align:start position:0%
believe that it is or has is excuse me
 
05:49:08.190 --> 05:49:08.200 align:start position:0%
that it has been or is being abused an
 
05:49:10.150 --> 05:49:10.160 align:start position:0%
unintended consequence of the proposed
 
05:49:11.910 --> 05:49:11.920 align:start position:0%
legislation is the potential for an
 
05:49:14.270 --> 05:49:14.280 align:start position:0%
escalation in seizures of basophilic
 
05:49:16.670 --> 05:49:16.680 align:start position:0%
dogs or any other breeds targeted as
 
05:49:18.548 --> 05:49:18.558 align:start position:0%
having birth deformities by Humane
 
05:49:21.070 --> 05:49:21.080 align:start position:0%
Societies in New Hampshire as the demand
 
05:49:23.230 --> 05:49:23.240 align:start position:0%
for specific breeds Rises due to the
 
05:49:25.590 --> 05:49:25.600 align:start position:0%
scarcity of the breeders in the state
 
05:49:27.468 --> 05:49:27.478 align:start position:0%
rescues and shelters may feel compelled
 
05:49:30.468 --> 05:49:30.478 align:start position:0%
to step in to meet demand uh this could
 
05:49:32.590 --> 05:49:32.600 align:start position:0%
inadvertently lead shelters to be
 
05:49:34.350 --> 05:49:34.360 align:start position:0%
compelled to Target remaining breeders
 
05:49:36.510 --> 05:49:36.520 align:start position:0%
and seizing their animals for financial
 
05:49:40.430 --> 05:49:40.440 align:start position:0%
gain um moving I believe your time is up
 
05:49:43.868 --> 05:49:43.878 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry okay are there any
 
05:49:46.948 --> 05:49:46.958 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
05:49:51.948 --> 05:49:51.958 align:start position:0%
committee so with with regard to
 
05:49:54.150 --> 05:49:54.160 align:start position:0%
um the the
 
05:49:56.628 --> 05:49:56.638 align:start position:0%
Breeders that you mentioned about
 
05:50:00.190 --> 05:50:00.200 align:start position:0%
seizures yes C what what what part of
 
05:50:03.230 --> 05:50:03.240 align:start position:0%
the law were you referencing that if you
 
05:50:08.830 --> 05:50:08.840 align:start position:0%
look at 644 colon 8 Roman numeral 4- a
 
05:50:11.150 --> 05:50:11.160 align:start position:0%
there is a specific line that says that
 
05:50:14.230 --> 05:50:14.240 align:start position:0%
if you are if there is probable cause
 
05:50:17.190 --> 05:50:17.200 align:start position:0%
that you are inflicting animal cruelty
 
05:50:18.708 --> 05:50:18.718 align:start position:0%
which we're talking about these birth
 
05:50:21.708 --> 05:50:21.718 align:start position:0%
deformities becoming animal cruelty that
 
05:50:24.990 --> 05:50:25.000 align:start position:0%
a duy licensed Humane officer would be
 
05:50:27.270 --> 05:50:27.280 align:start position:0%
able to go in and take temporary custody
 
05:50:30.030 --> 05:50:30.040 align:start position:0%
of the animals um one of the biggest
 
05:50:31.868 --> 05:50:31.878 align:start position:0%
questions we've had here is how are we
 
05:50:34.468 --> 05:50:34.478 align:start position:0%
going to determine if the dogs are being
 
05:50:36.788 --> 05:50:36.798 align:start position:0%
intentionally bred if they have the
 
05:50:39.430 --> 05:50:39.440 align:start position:0%
deformity and have been being sold and
 
05:50:41.510 --> 05:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
if we have a breeder in the state that
 
05:50:41.520 --> 05:50:42.390 align:start position:0%
if we have a breeder in the state that
is

05:50:42.390 --> 05:50:42.400 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:50:44.868 --> 05:50:44.878 align:start position:0%
potentially under animal cruelty
 
05:50:48.270 --> 05:50:48.280 align:start position:0%
breaking the law these breeders could
 
05:50:50.670 --> 05:50:50.680 align:start position:0%
have their animals seized as part of
 
05:50:52.590 --> 05:50:52.600 align:start position:0%
this new law based on what we have here
 
05:50:57.390 --> 05:50:57.400 align:start position:0%
in place M and what about um so I know
 
05:50:59.910 --> 05:50:59.920 align:start position:0%
you breed animals
 
05:51:02.230 --> 05:51:02.240 align:start position:0%
can you describe a little bit about um
 
05:51:04.390 --> 05:51:04.400 align:start position:0%
the level of control you have as a
 
05:51:07.030 --> 05:51:07.040 align:start position:0%
breeder um
 
05:51:10.750 --> 05:51:10.760 align:start position:0%
regarding the the outcome of the of the
 
05:51:15.390 --> 05:51:15.400 align:start position:0%
litter sure um little little control um
 
05:51:17.750 --> 05:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
as mentioned earlier is there is science
 
05:51:19.830 --> 05:51:19.840 align:start position:0%
behind it it is an art you know in
 
05:51:21.548 --> 05:51:21.558 align:start position:0%
choosing what we're going to have for
 
05:51:24.430 --> 05:51:24.440 align:start position:0%
the parents to try and produce the ideal
 
05:51:26.628 --> 05:51:26.638 align:start position:0%
puppy who's going to be healthy good
 
05:51:29.468 --> 05:51:29.478 align:start position:0%
temperament live a long life life um and
 
05:51:32.430 --> 05:51:32.440 align:start position:0%
then there is Mother Nature you know
 
05:51:34.788 --> 05:51:34.798 align:start position:0%
things are potentially going to happen
 
05:51:37.230 --> 05:51:37.240 align:start position:0%
that we have no control over so while we
 
05:51:39.230 --> 05:51:39.240 align:start position:0%
do intend to do the very best that we
 
05:51:42.230 --> 05:51:42.240 align:start position:0%
can um sometimes birth deformities can
 
05:51:45.150 --> 05:51:45.160 align:start position:0%
happen uh I myself personally did have a
 
05:51:48.230 --> 05:51:48.240 align:start position:0%
puppy that was born with a liver shunt
 
05:51:50.030 --> 05:51:50.040 align:start position:0%
which did not appear until she was about
 
05:51:52.510 --> 05:51:52.520 align:start position:0%
6 months old she was in her home loved
 
05:51:55.190 --> 05:51:55.200 align:start position:0%
by her new owner and it was a very
 
05:51:56.910 --> 05:51:56.920 align:start position:0%
devastating experience that we went
 
05:51:59.510 --> 05:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
through together um I will mention that
 
05:52:01.628 --> 05:52:01.638 align:start position:0%
she did go through and get her health
 
05:52:03.468 --> 05:52:03.478 align:start position:0%
certificate which I think is really
 
05:52:06.548 --> 05:52:06.558 align:start position:0%
important was touched on briefly earlier
 
05:52:08.310 --> 05:52:08.320 align:start position:0%
um but Health certificates are issued
 
05:52:10.110 --> 05:52:10.120 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire by a licensed
 
05:52:12.070 --> 05:52:12.080 align:start position:0%
veterinarian and they're critical
 
05:52:14.190 --> 05:52:14.200 align:start position:0%
documents that provide Assurance to
 
05:52:16.708 --> 05:52:16.718 align:start position:0%
perspective pet owners when a burer
 
05:52:18.430 --> 05:52:18.440 align:start position:0%
provides health certificate along with
 
05:52:20.070 --> 05:52:20.080 align:start position:0%
the sale of a dog they are testing to
 
05:52:22.910 --> 05:52:22.920 align:start position:0%
the animal's Health um so our health
 
05:52:25.468 --> 05:52:25.478 align:start position:0%
certificates no longer a certificate of
 
05:52:27.030 --> 05:52:27.040 align:start position:0%
the health of an animal here in New
 
05:52:29.708 --> 05:52:29.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire if if they aren't there to do
 
05:52:32.070 --> 05:52:32.080 align:start position:0%
the job um if something was to happen
 
05:52:35.110 --> 05:52:35.120 align:start position:0%
down the road so if no health issues or
 
05:52:37.510 --> 05:52:37.520 align:start position:0%
deformities were identified during the
 
05:52:40.150 --> 05:52:40.160 align:start position:0%
veterinary examination the breeder is
 
05:52:42.390 --> 05:52:42.400 align:start position:0%
not knowingly selling a sick or deformed
 
05:52:44.948 --> 05:52:44.958 align:start position:0%
animal but there is another piece of
 
05:52:46.868 --> 05:52:46.878 align:start position:0%
Statute related to health certificates
 
05:52:49.230 --> 05:52:49.240 align:start position:0%
and the selling of deformed animals that
 
05:52:51.788 --> 05:52:51.798 align:start position:0%
I'd like to elaborate on if I may sure
 
05:52:54.548 --> 05:52:54.558 align:start position:0%
what what statute is that this is 437
 
05:52:58.270 --> 05:52:58.280 align:start position:0%
colon a Roman numeral 2 it allows for
 
05:53:00.270 --> 05:53:00.280 align:start position:0%
waiver if the animal is being sold with
 
05:53:02.510 --> 05:53:02.520 align:start position:0%
a non-contagious medical condition which
 
05:53:05.030 --> 05:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
could include certain deformities uh the
 
05:53:06.990 --> 05:53:07.000 align:start position:0%
provision recognizes that not all
 
05:53:09.070 --> 05:53:09.080 align:start position:0%
medical conditions are necessarily
 
05:53:11.070 --> 05:53:11.080 align:start position:0%
debilitating or harmful to the animal's
 
05:53:13.390 --> 05:53:13.400 align:start position:0%
welfare and allows for the flexibility
 
05:53:17.628 --> 05:53:17.638 align:start position:0%
in the sale process so if HB 1102 were
 
05:53:19.948 --> 05:53:19.958 align:start position:0%
to pass it could create a conflicting
 
05:53:22.468 --> 05:53:22.478 align:start position:0%
situation in the law on one hand Health
 
05:53:24.190 --> 05:53:24.200 align:start position:0%
certificates provide Assurance to
 
05:53:26.430 --> 05:53:26.440 align:start position:0%
animals Health at the time of purchase
 
05:53:27.990 --> 05:53:28.000 align:start position:0%
while on the other hand the legislation
 
05:53:29.788 --> 05:53:29.798 align:start position:0%
May May classify the sale of the dog
 
05:53:31.430 --> 05:53:31.440 align:start position:0%
with certain deformities as animal
 
05:53:34.030 --> 05:53:34.040 align:start position:0%
cruelty so this inconsistency could
 
05:53:36.628 --> 05:53:36.638 align:start position:0%
create confusion and legal ambiguity for
 
05:53:38.708 --> 05:53:38.718 align:start position:0%
breeders and purchasers alike
 
05:53:40.350 --> 05:53:40.360 align:start position:0%
potentially discouraging responsible
 
05:53:44.430 --> 05:53:44.440 align:start position:0%
breeding practices and limiting consumer
 
05:53:47.390 --> 05:53:47.400 align:start position:0%
choice and and that was
 
05:53:52.468 --> 05:53:52.478 align:start position:0%
437a 437 colon a Roman numeral
 
05:53:56.310 --> 05:53:56.320 align:start position:0%
2 so that's in the health certificate
 
05:53:59.270 --> 05:53:59.280 align:start position:0%
section um so it's important to
 
05:54:01.628 --> 05:54:01.638 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that although Veterinary
 
05:54:04.070 --> 05:54:04.080 align:start position:0%
examinations are critical some medical
 
05:54:06.110 --> 05:54:06.120 align:start position:0%
conditions and or deformities may not be
 
05:54:08.468 --> 05:54:08.478 align:start position:0%
immediately apparent so that's why we
 
05:54:10.830 --> 05:54:10.840 align:start position:0%
always recommend that purchasers are
 
05:54:14.030 --> 05:54:14.040 align:start position:0%
insist on getting a contract with their
 
05:54:17.190 --> 05:54:17.200 align:start position:0%
breeder okay would you think that there
 
05:54:19.868 --> 05:54:19.878 align:start position:0%
should be any place on the health
 
05:54:23.150 --> 05:54:23.160 align:start position:0%
certificate to show that there is some
 
05:54:25.350 --> 05:54:25.360 align:start position:0%
sort of genetic
 
05:54:28.628 --> 05:54:28.638 align:start position:0%
issue possible genetic issue with the
 
05:54:31.468 --> 05:54:31.478 align:start position:0%
animal I will leave that to our
 
05:54:32.948 --> 05:54:32.958 align:start position:0%
veterinarian who's going to speak a
 
05:54:34.628 --> 05:54:34.638 align:start position:0%
little bit further but I do know when I
 
05:54:36.670 --> 05:54:36.680 align:start position:0%
have ever had a situation with a puppy
 
05:54:38.270 --> 05:54:38.280 align:start position:0%
for example I had one that had an
 
05:54:40.590 --> 05:54:40.600 align:start position:0%
umbilical hernia very mild didn't
 
05:54:43.230 --> 05:54:43.240 align:start position:0%
require any surgery usually as they get
 
05:54:46.310 --> 05:54:46.320 align:start position:0%
larger they outgrow it and I my
 
05:54:49.190 --> 05:54:49.200 align:start position:0%
veterinarian did indicate that on the
 
05:54:50.948 --> 05:54:50.958 align:start position:0%
health certificate so that the owner was
 
05:54:53.510 --> 05:54:53.520 align:start position:0%
aware of the situation so they knew what
 
05:54:54.910 --> 05:54:54.920 align:start position:0%
they were
 
05:54:58.110 --> 05:54:58.120 align:start position:0%
buying okay representative Bixby yeah I
 
05:55:00.590 --> 05:55:00.600 align:start position:0%
just uh wanted to um point a little
 
05:55:04.430 --> 05:55:04.440 align:start position:0%
slight clarification on uh 437 colon 82
 
05:55:07.948 --> 05:55:07.958 align:start position:0%
about the health certificate waiver uh
 
05:55:11.510 --> 05:55:11.520 align:start position:0%
the the the reason that that is there is
 
05:55:14.110 --> 05:55:14.120 align:start position:0%
because it is possible to have a dog
 
05:55:16.350 --> 05:55:16.360 align:start position:0%
that has a health problem but it is not
 
05:55:19.310 --> 05:55:19.320 align:start position:0%
a contagious health problem and in that
 
05:55:23.310 --> 05:55:23.320 align:start position:0%
case it makes sense to have the uh
 
05:55:26.190 --> 05:55:26.200 align:start position:0%
potentially have uh an order for that
 
05:55:28.110 --> 05:55:28.120 align:start position:0%
dog who would be able to take care of
 
05:55:29.990 --> 05:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
the the animal and would be aware of
 
05:55:33.868 --> 05:55:33.878 align:start position:0%
that health problem uh but it so uh one
 
05:55:36.430 --> 05:55:36.440 align:start position:0%
of the so there's the health certificate
 
05:55:39.830 --> 05:55:39.840 align:start position:0%
has to do both with screening for what
 
05:55:41.708 --> 05:55:41.718 align:start position:0%
might be contagious which you just don't
 
05:55:43.468 --> 05:55:43.478 align:start position:0%
want to get out there right and also
 
05:55:46.990 --> 05:55:47.000 align:start position:0%
screening and also screening for uh
 
05:55:49.270 --> 05:55:49.280 align:start position:0%
hereditary problems or or non-contagious
 
05:55:52.270 --> 05:55:52.280 align:start position:0%
problems and the waiver allows for the
 
05:55:55.708 --> 05:55:55.718 align:start position:0%
non-contagious problems uh to the dog
 
05:55:57.230 --> 05:55:57.240 align:start position:0%
can still be transferred even if there's
 
05:55:59.110 --> 05:55:59.120 align:start position:0%
a non-contagious problem okay thank you
 
05:56:01.948 --> 05:56:01.958 align:start position:0%
for clarifying that yep which could be a
 
05:56:04.390 --> 05:56:04.400 align:start position:0%
deformity that could technically
 
05:56:06.750 --> 05:56:06.760 align:start position:0%
depending on who was evalua it be
 
05:56:09.270 --> 05:56:09.280 align:start position:0%
considered to cause
 
05:56:11.628 --> 05:56:11.638 align:start position:0%
suffering okay any other questions from
 
05:56:14.430 --> 05:56:14.440 align:start position:0%
the committee seeing none thank you very
 
05:56:16.350 --> 05:56:16.360 align:start position:0%
much thank
 
05:56:19.868 --> 05:56:19.878 align:start position:0%
you um yeah I think I want to take a
 
05:56:21.510 --> 05:56:21.520 align:start position:0%
five minute break in case anybody needs
 
05:56:24.430 --> 05:56:24.440 align:start position:0%
to go to the bathroom or just uh because
 
05:56:27.310 --> 05:56:27.320 align:start position:0%
we've been at this for three hours and
 
05:56:28.868 --> 05:56:28.878 align:start position:0%
uh just a five minute break and then
 
05:56:56.788 --> 05:56:56.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:56.798 --> 06:01:58.070 align:start position:0%
 
back

06:01:58.070 --> 06:01:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:00.110 --> 06:02:00.120 align:start position:0%
I'm going to ask our committee members
 
06:02:07.628 --> 06:02:07.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:09.948 --> 06:02:09.958 align:start position:0%
seats I would like our committee members
 
06:02:25.390 --> 06:02:25.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:27.868 --> 06:02:27.878 align:start position:0%
seats is this just one sheet yeah
 
06:02:32.190 --> 06:02:32.200 align:start position:0%
there's another one coming oh okay
 
06:02:35.110 --> 06:02:35.120 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for getting back uh so
 
06:02:37.548 --> 06:02:37.558 align:start position:0%
quickly and I guess we are going to
 
06:02:40.628 --> 06:02:40.638 align:start position:0%
resume we've got still several pinks
 
06:02:42.830 --> 06:02:42.840 align:start position:0%
pink cards and I hope we can get through
 
06:02:49.788 --> 06:02:49.798 align:start position:0%
this fairly quickly um I will say that I
 
06:02:55.110 --> 06:02:55.120 align:start position:0%
have um one pink card that's in support
 
06:02:57.868 --> 06:02:57.878 align:start position:0%
and the rest of them are in opposition
 
06:03:01.390 --> 06:03:01.400 align:start position:0%
to uh HB 1102 if there is anyone else
 
06:03:03.910 --> 06:03:03.920 align:start position:0%
who wishes to speak who supports the
 
06:03:07.190 --> 06:03:07.200 align:start position:0%
bill I would like to have your pink card
 
06:03:10.430 --> 06:03:10.440 align:start position:0%
as soon as possible other than that I'm
 
06:03:13.430 --> 06:03:13.440 align:start position:0%
going to call Martha
 
06:03:18.190 --> 06:03:18.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:21.468 --> 06:03:21.478 align:start position:0%
speak thank you very much um please put
 
06:03:23.708 --> 06:03:23.718 align:start position:0%
your microphone on and you have three
 
06:03:25.990 --> 06:03:26.000 align:start position:0%
minutes thank you thank you very much
 
06:03:29.270 --> 06:03:29.280 align:start position:0%
this has been such a an interesting um
 
06:03:31.270 --> 06:03:31.280 align:start position:0%
session and I really appreciate the
 
06:03:33.468 --> 06:03:33.478 align:start position:0%
information that I've been hearing from
 
06:03:36.430 --> 06:03:36.440 align:start position:0%
both sides of this issue a full
 
06:03:39.788 --> 06:03:39.798 align:start position:0%
disclosure Little Penny is my grand doog
 
06:03:42.030 --> 06:03:42.040 align:start position:0%
so I've been through it with her I just
 
06:03:45.110 --> 06:03:45.120 align:start position:0%
wanted to say a couple of things briefly
 
06:03:47.990 --> 06:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
my biggest takeaway from listening to
 
06:03:50.788 --> 06:03:50.798 align:start position:0%
everything here is
 
06:03:54.830 --> 06:03:54.840 align:start position:0%
that the breeding standards for
 
06:03:58.150 --> 06:03:58.160 align:start position:0%
extreme sorry Breaky
 
06:04:01.990 --> 06:04:02.000 align:start position:0%
seil are the problem that's my biggest
 
06:04:05.270 --> 06:04:05.280 align:start position:0%
takeaway um that's not a comment on
 
06:04:07.788 --> 06:04:07.798 align:start position:0%
breeders it's not a comment on anyone I
 
06:04:10.708 --> 06:04:10.718 align:start position:0%
think it's time for much more Awareness
 
06:04:13.990 --> 06:04:14.000 align:start position:0%
on this and some changes new stuff comes
 
06:04:15.628 --> 06:04:15.638 align:start position:0%
up all the time we don't have to live
 
06:04:17.110 --> 06:04:17.120 align:start position:0%
with stuff that was
 
06:04:20.070 --> 06:04:20.080 align:start position:0%
happening 50 years ago 100 years ago a
 
06:04:22.150 --> 06:04:22.160 align:start position:0%
thousand years ago so that was one of
 
06:04:24.670 --> 06:04:24.680 align:start position:0%
the biggest things
 
06:04:28.230 --> 06:04:28.240 align:start position:0%
um it's not a breed band breeders I
 
06:04:29.750 --> 06:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
don't think you need to be afraid of
 
06:04:32.270 --> 06:04:32.280 align:start position:0%
this it's pretty basic and simple you
 
06:04:36.070 --> 06:04:36.080 align:start position:0%
cannot intentionally if this is is past
 
06:04:39.628 --> 06:04:39.638 align:start position:0%
you can't intentionally breed dogs two
 
06:04:42.270 --> 06:04:42.280 align:start position:0%
dogs with the same
 
06:04:45.750 --> 06:04:45.760 align:start position:0%
deformity um that causes
 
06:04:48.510 --> 06:04:48.520 align:start position:0%
suffering um so we may be overco
 
06:04:49.948 --> 06:04:49.958 align:start position:0%
complicating the issue when we're
 
06:04:52.310 --> 06:04:52.320 align:start position:0%
talking about genetics and all that sort
 
06:04:54.468 --> 06:04:54.478 align:start position:0%
of thing
 
06:04:57.548 --> 06:04:57.558 align:start position:0%
um let's see it's not the breed
 
06:05:00.510 --> 06:05:00.520 align:start position:0%
themselves that are the problem you know
 
06:05:03.948 --> 06:05:03.958 align:start position:0%
it's the breeding standards I also
 
06:05:08.110 --> 06:05:08.120 align:start position:0%
thought um oh the bill it only adds to
 
06:05:10.390 --> 06:05:10.400 align:start position:0%
the existing definition of Cruelty the
 
06:05:12.190 --> 06:05:12.200 align:start position:0%
first offense is a misdemeanor somebody
 
06:05:15.868 --> 06:05:15.878 align:start position:0%
mentioned a felony um and that sort of
 
06:05:17.910 --> 06:05:17.920 align:start position:0%
thing couple of assumptions that I've
 
06:05:20.190 --> 06:05:20.200 align:start position:0%
heard that I just wanted to correct one
 
06:05:22.830 --> 06:05:22.840 align:start position:0%
was Penny was purchased in Ohio not
 
06:05:24.830 --> 06:05:24.840 align:start position:0%
because my daughter didn't research
 
06:05:27.150 --> 06:05:27.160 align:start position:0%
breeders in New Hampshire she researched
 
06:05:28.868 --> 06:05:28.878 align:start position:0%
a breeder in New Hampshire
 
06:05:32.590 --> 06:05:32.600 align:start position:0%
first and uh found unsatisfactory they
 
06:05:35.030 --> 06:05:35.040 align:start position:0%
were breeding uh non-standard non-breed
 
06:05:38.230 --> 06:05:38.240 align:start position:0%
standard colors so she decided to look
 
06:05:40.628 --> 06:05:40.638 align:start position:0%
elsewhere and she looked all over uh the
 
06:05:40.638 --> 06:05:42.230 align:start position:0%
elsewhere and she looked all over uh the
Mid-Atlantic

06:05:42.230 --> 06:05:42.240 align:start position:0%
Mid-Atlantic
 
06:05:42.240 --> 06:05:44.230 align:start position:0%
Mid-Atlantic
Seaboard

06:05:44.230 --> 06:05:44.240 align:start position:0%
Seaboard
 
06:05:47.750 --> 06:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
um I kind of get the idea that maybe
 
06:05:52.350 --> 06:05:52.360 align:start position:0%
breeders aren't necessarily aware of um
 
06:05:54.990 --> 06:05:55.000 align:start position:0%
the complications of
 
06:05:58.788 --> 06:05:58.798 align:start position:0%
Boaz because the person that my daughter
 
06:06:02.628 --> 06:06:02.638 align:start position:0%
went to had no I never mentioned Boaz or
 
06:06:05.868 --> 06:06:05.878 align:start position:0%
breaki step the vet signed off on this
 
06:06:09.150 --> 06:06:09.160 align:start position:0%
dog and um you know she came home and a
 
06:06:11.310 --> 06:06:11.320 align:start position:0%
week later she was near
 
06:06:14.468 --> 06:06:14.478 align:start position:0%
death um I also think that if we have
 
06:06:16.110 --> 06:06:16.120 align:start position:0%
healthy breed standards here in New
 
06:06:18.590 --> 06:06:18.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire people will flock to breeders
 
06:06:21.548 --> 06:06:21.558 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire they won't go elsewhere
 
06:06:23.390 --> 06:06:23.400 align:start position:0%
I think that's pretty
 
06:06:23.400 --> 06:06:25.030 align:start position:0%
I think that's pretty
important

06:06:25.030 --> 06:06:25.040 align:start position:0%
important
 
06:06:28.390 --> 06:06:28.400 align:start position:0%
um also one other assumption was that oh
 
06:06:30.990 --> 06:06:31.000 align:start position:0%
people will report these things to the
 
06:06:33.708 --> 06:06:33.718 align:start position:0%
state no that's not true my daughter
 
06:06:35.590 --> 06:06:35.600 align:start position:0%
didn't even want to report it to her the
 
06:06:36.830 --> 06:06:36.840 align:start position:0%
breeder because she didn't want to hurt
 
06:06:39.628 --> 06:06:39.638 align:start position:0%
their feelings thank you very much okay
 
06:06:41.788 --> 06:06:41.798 align:start position:0%
thank you very much any
 
06:06:44.310 --> 06:06:44.320 align:start position:0%
questions okay thank you for your

afternoon

06:07:25.910 --> 06:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
afternoon
 
06:07:25.920 --> 06:07:31.110 align:start position:0%
afternoon
okay

06:07:31.110 --> 06:07:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:33.910 --> 06:07:33.920 align:start position:0%
um my name is Diane Tyrie I'm a resident
 
06:07:36.190 --> 06:07:36.200 align:start position:0%
of hollus and a former breeder of
 
06:07:40.150 --> 06:07:40.160 align:start position:0%
Tibetan spaniels I currently live with
 
06:07:42.990 --> 06:07:43.000 align:start position:0%
poor geriatric Tibetan spaniels at Rag
 
06:07:47.230 --> 06:07:47.240 align:start position:0%
and age from 11 to
 
06:07:52.150 --> 06:07:52.160 align:start position:0%
14 I have passed out some information
 
06:07:53.628 --> 06:07:53.638 align:start position:0%
about the
 
06:07:58.110 --> 06:07:58.120 align:start position:0%
Boaz grading or functional test system
 
06:08:00.750 --> 06:08:00.760 align:start position:0%
everybody has talked about it but nobody
 
06:08:04.110 --> 06:08:04.120 align:start position:0%
has talked about the various
 
06:08:07.190 --> 06:08:07.200 align:start position:0%
grades I think it's important to
 
06:08:10.708 --> 06:08:10.718 align:start position:0%
understand that these dogs are graded
 
06:08:13.510 --> 06:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
from one to
 
06:08:17.310 --> 06:08:17.320 align:start position:0%
three a one being a perfectly clear dog
 
06:08:20.910 --> 06:08:20.920 align:start position:0%
and a three being a dog that has been
 
06:08:22.948 --> 06:08:22.958 align:start position:0%
classified as
 
06:08:22.958 --> 06:08:25.150 align:start position:0%
classified as
effective

06:08:25.150 --> 06:08:25.160 align:start position:0%
effective
 
06:08:28.750 --> 06:08:28.760 align:start position:0%
affected that being said my big question
 
06:08:35.548 --> 06:08:35.558 align:start position:0%
is what do breeders do with dogs that or
 
06:08:39.430 --> 06:08:39.440 align:start position:0%
puppies that are classified as a three
 
06:08:39.440 --> 06:08:40.430 align:start position:0%
puppies that are classified as a three
and

06:08:40.430 --> 06:08:40.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:08:43.070 --> 06:08:43.080 align:start position:0%
effective that cannot be
 
06:08:47.150 --> 06:08:47.160 align:start position:0%
sold do they euthanize them something
 
06:08:48.990 --> 06:08:49.000 align:start position:0%
that has to be
 
06:08:51.788 --> 06:08:51.798 align:start position:0%
considered I'd also like to make you
 
06:08:57.110 --> 06:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
aware of eight ancient dog breeds from
 
06:08:59.628 --> 06:08:59.638 align:start position:0%
China and Tibet that have been
 
06:09:03.390 --> 06:09:03.400 align:start position:0%
classified as brachio calic and survived
 
06:09:06.310 --> 06:09:06.320 align:start position:0%
despite the inhospitable climate and
 
06:09:09.788 --> 06:09:09.798 align:start position:0%
topography of those areas these are the
 
06:09:12.830 --> 06:09:12.840 align:start position:0%
Chinese Sharpe the chowchow the Pug the
 
06:09:16.510 --> 06:09:16.520 align:start position:0%
pinies the Japanese Chin with roots in
 
06:09:19.948 --> 06:09:19.958 align:start position:0%
China the Lassa Absa the Tibetan Spaniel
 
06:09:22.548 --> 06:09:22.558 align:start position:0%
and the shitzu from
 
06:09:25.708 --> 06:09:25.718 align:start position:0%
Tibet these breeds have
 
06:09:29.070 --> 06:09:29.080 align:start position:0%
survived 2,000 years or
 
06:09:33.190 --> 06:09:33.200 align:start position:0%
more there many of them are long lived
 
06:09:34.628 --> 06:09:34.638 align:start position:0%
breeds the
 
06:09:38.750 --> 06:09:38.760 align:start position:0%
current Lee the average life of a Pines
 
06:09:40.750 --> 06:09:40.760 align:start position:0%
is longer than that of a golden
 
06:09:43.150 --> 06:09:43.160 align:start position:0%
retriever in that new
 
06:09:45.628 --> 06:09:45.638 align:start position:0%
study there has been a lot of concern
 
06:09:48.230 --> 06:09:48.240 align:start position:0%
about brachio phalic breeds and their
 
06:09:52.070 --> 06:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
health a lot of it is exaggerated and
 
06:09:55.990 --> 06:09:56.000 align:start position:0%
incorrect as an AKC judge of Lassa opsis
 
06:09:59.150 --> 06:09:59.160 align:start position:0%
in tibetan spaniels I have to question
 
06:10:01.868 --> 06:10:01.878 align:start position:0%
how either of these breeds could be
 
06:10:05.150 --> 06:10:05.160 align:start position:0%
considered brachio phalic yet both are
 
06:10:08.190 --> 06:10:08.200 align:start position:0%
listed as being so so therefore I ask
 
06:10:10.390 --> 06:10:10.400 align:start position:0%
you to take a long look at the history
 
06:10:11.948 --> 06:10:11.958 align:start position:0%
of these ancient
 
06:10:15.468 --> 06:10:15.478 align:start position:0%
breeds the accuracy of classification of
 
06:10:18.350 --> 06:10:18.360 align:start position:0%
the breeds as brachio falic and the
 
06:10:21.708 --> 06:10:21.718 align:start position:0%
availability of current testing methods
 
06:10:23.230 --> 06:10:23.240 align:start position:0%
when you make your
 
06:10:25.948 --> 06:10:25.958 align:start position:0%
decision okay thank you you times up any
 
06:10:28.430 --> 06:10:28.440 align:start position:0%
questions any questions from the
 
06:10:30.590 --> 06:10:30.600 align:start position:0%
committee representa
 
06:10:32.670 --> 06:10:32.680 align:start position:0%
Murray thank you madam chair and thank
 
06:10:35.548 --> 06:10:35.558 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question with regard
 
06:10:38.150 --> 06:10:38.160 align:start position:0%
to the grading now correct me if I'm not
 
06:10:40.230 --> 06:10:40.240 align:start position:0%
wrong I believe there was a veterinarian
 
06:10:41.830 --> 06:10:41.840 align:start position:0%
who tested that there was a grading
 
06:10:45.628 --> 06:10:45.638 align:start position:0%
scale 0o to four and so I'm curious what
 
06:10:45.638 --> 06:10:46.430 align:start position:0%
scale 0o to four and so I'm curious what
the

06:10:46.430 --> 06:10:46.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:10:48.948 --> 06:10:48.958 align:start position:0%
difference I don't know about the zero
 
06:10:55.548 --> 06:10:55.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:55.558 --> 06:10:59.270 align:start position:0%
 
online

06:10:59.270 --> 06:10:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:02.190 --> 06:11:02.200 align:start position:0%
okay okay but thank you I was curious to
 
06:11:04.150 --> 06:11:04.160 align:start position:0%
as to know whether or not you had come
 
06:11:07.150 --> 06:11:07.160 align:start position:0%
across that I have not come across a
 
06:11:12.190 --> 06:11:12.200 align:start position:0%
zero to four I everything I had found
 
06:11:16.510 --> 06:11:16.520 align:start position:0%
was a zero to three grading system okay
 
06:11:19.910 --> 06:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative ger I yeah
 
06:11:21.548 --> 06:11:21.558 align:start position:0%
thank you I just wanted to say for point
 
06:11:23.830 --> 06:11:23.840 align:start position:0%
of clarification I had referred to a
 
06:11:26.030 --> 06:11:26.040 align:start position:0%
note I got from my veterinarian who
 
06:11:27.948 --> 06:11:27.958 align:start position:0%
referred to one through four so I
 
06:11:29.270 --> 06:11:29.280 align:start position:0%
suspect the can of 1 through four
 
06:11:31.990 --> 06:11:32.000 align:start position:0%
equates to Z three through three so four
 
06:11:33.390 --> 06:11:33.400 align:start position:0%
categories yeah I think that was the
 
06:11:34.948 --> 06:11:34.958 align:start position:0%
confusion yeah thank you for the
 
06:11:38.110 --> 06:11:38.120 align:start position:0%
clarification that Mak thank you okay
 
06:11:40.510 --> 06:11:40.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony uh Jane
 
06:11:40.520 --> 06:11:55.270 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony uh Jane
Barlo

06:11:55.270 --> 06:11:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:59.230 --> 06:11:59.240 align:start position:0%
Roy good afternoon um I have testified
 
06:12:01.110 --> 06:12:01.120 align:start position:0%
in front of you guys before um but to
 
06:12:03.310 --> 06:12:03.320 align:start position:0%
reintroduce myself my name is Dr Jane
 
06:12:07.030 --> 06:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
maroy I am um representing the New
 
06:12:08.910 --> 06:12:08.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Veterinary Medical Association
 
06:12:11.110 --> 06:12:11.120 align:start position:0%
and as delegate to the American veter
 
06:12:13.510 --> 06:12:13.520 align:start position:0%
Medical Association I have been a pra
 
06:12:15.788 --> 06:12:15.798 align:start position:0%
practitioner here in the conquered area
 
06:12:19.270 --> 06:12:19.280 align:start position:0%
for just about 18 years and I did grow
 
06:12:21.350 --> 06:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
up here in New Hampshire and londonairy
 
06:12:24.270 --> 06:12:24.280 align:start position:0%
um in lie of reading my written
 
06:12:25.468 --> 06:12:25.478 align:start position:0%
testimony that I will give to
 
06:12:27.270 --> 06:12:27.280 align:start position:0%
representative com
 
06:12:31.350 --> 06:12:31.360 align:start position:0%
um I will just make the point of further
 
06:12:35.708 --> 06:12:35.718 align:start position:0%
defining the different types of sees
 
06:12:39.830 --> 06:12:39.840 align:start position:0%
because there are three known uh sees uh
 
06:12:41.670 --> 06:12:41.680 align:start position:0%
that the American veter Medical
 
06:12:45.310 --> 06:12:45.320 align:start position:0%
Association Association um defines um as
 
06:12:47.548 --> 06:12:47.558 align:start position:0%
well as my Veterinary textbooks so we
 
06:12:50.708 --> 06:12:50.718 align:start position:0%
have mesio falic which means average
 
06:12:54.708 --> 06:12:54.718 align:start position:0%
face which is your Labradors and um
 
06:12:57.390 --> 06:12:57.400 align:start position:0%
those sort of dogs we have Olio falic
 
06:13:00.390 --> 06:13:00.400 align:start position:0%
which is a longer nose dog um such as
 
06:13:02.830 --> 06:13:02.840 align:start position:0%
your Collies um and your Dobermans and
 
06:13:04.708 --> 06:13:04.718 align:start position:0%
then we have brachos phalic which is
 
06:13:07.830 --> 06:13:07.840 align:start position:0%
short-face dogs um or they can also be
 
06:13:11.708 --> 06:13:11.718 align:start position:0%
applied to other animals cats um and and
 
06:13:14.948 --> 06:13:14.958 align:start position:0%
such so with that I defer to questions
 
06:13:17.350 --> 06:13:17.360 align:start position:0%
um because I know your time is just as
 
06:13:21.150 --> 06:13:21.160 align:start position:0%
valuable as our time is okay do you you
 
06:13:23.990 --> 06:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
know if there are
 
06:13:28.948 --> 06:13:28.958 align:start position:0%
um also sey breeds that are in farm
 
06:13:33.708 --> 06:13:33.718 align:start position:0%
animals at all like pigs or cows or it's
 
06:13:35.390 --> 06:13:35.400 align:start position:0%
been a very long time since at school
 
06:13:38.788 --> 06:13:38.798 align:start position:0%
I'm a small animal practitioner okay um
 
06:13:40.868 --> 06:13:40.878 align:start position:0%
I can only remember the things that I
 
06:13:43.590 --> 06:13:43.600 align:start position:0%
see in in in the the my normal
 
06:13:46.510 --> 06:13:46.520 align:start position:0%
day-to-day life so I'm sure there are um
 
06:13:48.750 --> 06:13:48.760 align:start position:0%
and I would defer to the large animal
 
06:13:51.230 --> 06:13:51.240 align:start position:0%
Specialists okay representative Katon
 
06:13:53.548 --> 06:13:53.558 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry just are you opposed to this
 
06:13:55.708 --> 06:13:55.718 align:start position:0%
bill or I am opposed yes I'm I'm I'm in
 
06:13:57.590 --> 06:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
opposition to
 
06:13:59.390 --> 06:13:59.400 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure thank you for the
 
06:14:02.430 --> 06:14:02.440 align:start position:0%
record representative Bixby so in your
 
06:14:04.910 --> 06:14:04.920 align:start position:0%
time as a vet have you run across many
 
06:14:08.190 --> 06:14:08.200 align:start position:0%
animals that are uh suffering from the
 
06:14:11.270 --> 06:14:11.280 align:start position:0%
conditions that have been cited uh in
 
06:14:14.590 --> 06:14:14.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:17.990 --> 06:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
today in my almost 18 years I have come
 
06:14:22.030 --> 06:14:22.040 align:start position:0%
across many different disease processes
 
06:14:24.788 --> 06:14:24.798 align:start position:0%
cancers other sorts of deformities that
 
06:14:27.310 --> 06:14:27.320 align:start position:0%
do cause suffering um uh I could
 
06:14:28.990 --> 06:14:29.000 align:start position:0%
probably be here for the next several
 
06:14:31.270 --> 06:14:31.280 align:start position:0%
hours to several days going through that
 
06:14:32.628 --> 06:14:32.638 align:start position:0%
that's probably why I had four years of
 
06:14:35.590 --> 06:14:35.600 align:start position:0%
veterinary school um that's what our our
 
06:14:37.190 --> 06:14:37.200 align:start position:0%
our job was in veterinary school was to
 
06:14:40.350 --> 06:14:40.360 align:start position:0%
learn all these different things there
 
06:14:42.990 --> 06:14:43.000 align:start position:0%
are processes that are specific to
 
06:14:46.548 --> 06:14:46.558 align:start position:0%
certain breeds um and I think we would
 
06:14:48.430 --> 06:14:48.440 align:start position:0%
be remiss
 
06:14:52.230 --> 06:14:52.240 align:start position:0%
in calling them all deformities um
 
06:14:53.948 --> 06:14:53.958 align:start position:0%
because we do know that there are
 
06:14:55.868 --> 06:14:55.878 align:start position:0%
certain breeds of dogs that are more
 
06:14:58.150 --> 06:14:58.160 align:start position:0%
prone to heart disease than others we
 
06:14:59.548 --> 06:14:59.558 align:start position:0%
know that there are more dogs that are
 
06:15:01.990 --> 06:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
prone to cancers than others we know
 
06:15:04.390 --> 06:15:04.400 align:start position:0%
that there are breeds of cats that are
 
06:15:06.070 --> 06:15:06.080 align:start position:0%
more prone to upper respiratory
 
06:15:09.350 --> 06:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
infections um but that doesn't mean that
 
06:15:11.948 --> 06:15:11.958 align:start position:0%
that all falls under the the definition
 
06:15:15.190 --> 06:15:15.200 align:start position:0%
of birth deformity or birth
 
06:15:17.670 --> 06:15:17.680 align:start position:0%
defect okay thank you any other
 
06:15:18.990 --> 06:15:19.000 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
06:15:21.430 --> 06:15:21.440 align:start position:0%
committee thank you appreciate it I
 
06:15:23.590 --> 06:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
think one more kind of point to to your
 
06:15:26.310 --> 06:15:26.320 align:start position:0%
if if we started to go down that trail
 
06:15:27.990 --> 06:15:28.000 align:start position:0%
um and started to say well we can't
 
06:15:30.310 --> 06:15:30.320 align:start position:0%
breed Labradors because they are more
 
06:15:33.270 --> 06:15:33.280 align:start position:0%
prone to lymphoma we can't breed Golden
 
06:15:35.030 --> 06:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
Retrievers because they are more prone
 
06:15:38.350 --> 06:15:38.360 align:start position:0%
to homio saroma we can't breed beagles
 
06:15:40.708 --> 06:15:40.718 align:start position:0%
because they are prone to obesity we're
 
06:15:43.110 --> 06:15:43.120 align:start position:0%
going to be left with no animals um so I
 
06:15:44.628 --> 06:15:44.638 align:start position:0%
think that that's that's the that's our
 
06:15:47.350 --> 06:15:47.360 align:start position:0%
concern with this particular
 
06:15:51.110 --> 06:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
belt okay thank Youk appreciate it and I
 
06:15:52.948 --> 06:15:52.958 align:start position:0%
do have written testimony that the abma
 
06:15:54.110 --> 06:15:54.120 align:start position:0%
has all
 
06:16:10.350 --> 06:16:10.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:12.628 --> 06:16:12.638 align:start position:0%
good afternoon uh thank you for letting
 
06:16:15.670 --> 06:16:15.680 align:start position:0%
me testify this is so neat to be in New
 
06:16:17.310 --> 06:16:17.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and be able to do this I've
 
06:16:19.350 --> 06:16:19.360 align:start position:0%
lived in other states when I was younger
 
06:16:21.628 --> 06:16:21.638 align:start position:0%
and could never get to say hello to the
 
06:16:24.030 --> 06:16:24.040 align:start position:0%
governor or hello to Representatives so
 
06:16:27.548 --> 06:16:27.558 align:start position:0%
thank you um just briefly I am a breeder
 
06:16:30.110 --> 06:16:30.120 align:start position:0%
I have been in the breed that I chose
 
06:16:32.110 --> 06:16:32.120 align:start position:0%
which was Irish Water Spaniels although
 
06:16:34.230 --> 06:16:34.240 align:start position:0%
my mother chose it and then I followed
 
06:16:36.350 --> 06:16:36.360 align:start position:0%
through um since
 
06:16:39.548 --> 06:16:39.558 align:start position:0%
1958 I've been a breeder myself since
 
06:16:43.750 --> 06:16:43.760 align:start position:0%
1990 or excuse me 1980 and I just wanted
 
06:16:46.468 --> 06:16:46.478 align:start position:0%
you to hear from a Breeder's perspective
 
06:16:49.270 --> 06:16:49.280 align:start position:0%
this is very frightening to us for you
 
06:16:52.910 --> 06:16:52.920 align:start position:0%
for a bill to be set in front of you
 
06:16:55.628 --> 06:16:55.638 align:start position:0%
listing things that quote we've done
 
06:16:57.990 --> 06:16:58.000 align:start position:0%
wrong over the years and now somebody
 
06:17:00.948 --> 06:17:00.958 align:start position:0%
else is going to correct it um my breed
 
06:17:03.350 --> 06:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
standard is very specific it calls for a
 
06:17:06.670 --> 06:17:06.680 align:start position:0%
gate it calls for curly hair it calls
 
06:17:11.030 --> 06:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
for smooth face um and a tail with no
 
06:17:15.070 --> 06:17:15.080 align:start position:0%
hair on it um it's every breed has its
 
06:17:17.150 --> 06:17:17.160 align:start position:0%
characteristics and when we read this
 
06:17:20.350 --> 06:17:20.360 align:start position:0%
bill right away we said whoa
 
06:17:22.628 --> 06:17:22.638 align:start position:0%
deformity gee your nose doesn't look
 
06:17:24.670 --> 06:17:24.680 align:start position:0%
like mine am I deformed or are you
 
06:17:27.830 --> 06:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
deformed you know you
 
06:17:30.230 --> 06:17:30.240 align:start position:0%
you when you get into I'm also an
 
06:17:32.670 --> 06:17:32.680 align:start position:0%
emergency nurse so I do understand the
 
06:17:35.350 --> 06:17:35.360 align:start position:0%
process when somebody has a deformity
 
06:17:38.150 --> 06:17:38.160 align:start position:0%
like a rounded back they won't have good
 
06:17:40.708 --> 06:17:40.718 align:start position:0%
breathing things like that so I do
 
06:17:42.628 --> 06:17:42.638 align:start position:0%
understand that but I'm not sure we can
 
06:17:46.070 --> 06:17:46.080 align:start position:0%
legislate that I don't believe that's
 
06:17:47.948 --> 06:17:47.958 align:start position:0%
true and I think that one of the
 
06:17:49.708 --> 06:17:49.718 align:start position:0%
Breeders that I've talked to are
 
06:17:52.230 --> 06:17:52.240 align:start position:0%
frightened they are very frightened that
 
06:17:54.150 --> 06:17:54.160 align:start position:0%
you'll start on this slope and we'll go
 
06:17:54.160 --> 06:17:54.910 align:start position:0%
you'll start on this slope and we'll go
right

06:17:54.910 --> 06:17:54.920 align:start position:0%
right
 
06:17:57.190 --> 06:17:57.200 align:start position:0%
downhill M and I just have one more
 
06:17:59.868 --> 06:17:59.878 align:start position:0%
thing to say thank you so much for
 
06:18:02.708 --> 06:18:02.718 align:start position:0%
sitting here and listening to all of us
 
06:18:05.350 --> 06:18:05.360 align:start position:0%
and each year I get to stand up at the
 
06:18:07.708 --> 06:18:07.718 align:start position:0%
emergency nurses convention and be the
 
06:18:10.310 --> 06:18:10.320 align:start position:0%
only state in the United States and
 
06:18:12.830 --> 06:18:12.840 align:start position:0%
abroad that doesn't have a primary seat
 
06:18:15.830 --> 06:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
belt law but I still wear mine so anyhow
 
06:18:18.510 --> 06:18:18.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much yes yeah

it's the Irish Water spanel Club of
 
06:18:29.070 --> 06:18:29.080 align:start position:0%
America America and we have probably 50
 
06:18:31.468 --> 06:18:31.478 align:start position:0%
or 80 I I think it's now 80
 
06:18:34.948 --> 06:18:34.958 align:start position:0%
International people and we have a small
 
06:18:39.670 --> 06:18:39.680 align:start position:0%
breed um maybe 200 members but we're
 
06:18:41.628 --> 06:18:41.638 align:start position:0%
Mighty and we drink
 
06:18:45.590 --> 06:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:54.830 --> 06:18:54.840 align:start position:0%

that thank you can I start from yeah no
 
06:19:19.070 --> 06:19:19.080 align:start position:0%
go ahead all right chairman Aon and

an Air Force officer and an FBI agent
 
06:19:36.628 --> 06:19:36.638 align:start position:0%
I'm an AKC breeder of Merit I have been

as a general practitioner veterinarian
 
06:19:43.390 --> 06:19:43.400 align:start position:0%
for 22 years and I'm a court qualified

registration as well as animal cruelty
 
06:19:52.230 --> 06:19:52.240 align:start position:0%
and abuse in multiple jurisdictions I've
 
06:19:54.190 --> 06:19:54.200 align:start position:0%
participated in cases about animal abuse
 
06:19:56.190 --> 06:19:56.200 align:start position:0%
cruelty and neglect across the country
 
06:19:57.708 --> 06:19:57.718 align:start position:0%
and I currently contract with the New
 
06:19:59.990 --> 06:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire stratum SPCA as a veterinarian
 
06:20:02.590 --> 06:20:02.600 align:start position:0%
for this purpose in fact I was a meeting
 
06:20:04.948 --> 06:20:04.958 align:start position:0%
at a meeting 3 days ago with them and
 
06:20:07.910 --> 06:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
that they also opposed this bill I have
 
06:20:09.270 --> 06:20:09.280 align:start position:0%
devoted my life to the Health and
 
06:20:10.948 --> 06:20:10.958 align:start position:0%
Welfare of animals and my life revolves
 
06:20:12.390 --> 06:20:12.400 align:start position:0%
around dogs both personally and
 
06:20:14.430 --> 06:20:14.440 align:start position:0%
professionally I'm vehemently opposed to
 
06:20:15.750 --> 06:20:15.760 align:start position:0%
this bill and it is a bill full of
 
06:20:17.990 --> 06:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
erroneous assumptions and unforeseen
 
06:20:20.230 --> 06:20:20.240 align:start position:0%
consequences reputable breeders do know
 
06:20:21.830 --> 06:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
their pedigrees and conduct recommended
 
06:20:23.468 --> 06:20:23.478 align:start position:0%
Health testings and do their best to
 
06:20:26.150 --> 06:20:26.160 align:start position:0%
produce healthy dogs it is propos is to
 
06:20:27.750 --> 06:20:27.760 align:start position:0%
tell me that by breeding a healthy dog
 
06:20:29.590 --> 06:20:29.600 align:start position:0%
I'm committing animal abuse potentially
 
06:20:31.830 --> 06:20:31.840 align:start position:0%
a felony by virtue of an illd defined
 
06:20:33.948 --> 06:20:33.958 align:start position:0%
term alluding to a phenotypic headshape
 
06:20:36.270 --> 06:20:36.280 align:start position:0%
there is no standard definition of
 
06:20:38.468 --> 06:20:38.478 align:start position:0%
braisy and I've given you some research
 
06:20:41.070 --> 06:20:41.080 align:start position:0%
to support that it does describe a wide
 
06:20:43.110 --> 06:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
variation in the appearance of skull and
 
06:20:45.990 --> 06:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
equating that braisy with a deformity or
 
06:20:48.830 --> 06:20:48.840 align:start position:0%
animal cruelty is misinformed and not
 
06:20:52.910 --> 06:20:52.920 align:start position:0%
true braisy is not only seen in domestic
 
06:20:54.948 --> 06:20:54.958 align:start position:0%
species but it also occurs as a natural
 
06:20:57.670 --> 06:20:57.680 align:start position:0%
adaptation in species to its environment
 
06:21:00.270 --> 06:21:00.280 align:start position:0%
it occurs in sheep goats cattle horses
 
06:21:02.708 --> 06:21:02.718 align:start position:0%
Birds pigs rabbits dogs cats and even
 
06:21:06.190 --> 06:21:06.200 align:start position:0%
human and it is not always pathologic HP
 
06:21:08.868 --> 06:21:08.878 align:start position:0%
1102 could extend to other species as
 
06:21:11.030 --> 06:21:11.040 align:start position:0%
well there are a lot of studies out
 
06:21:12.990 --> 06:21:13.000 align:start position:0%
there that will discuss the implications
 
06:21:15.708 --> 06:21:15.718 align:start position:0%
of Boaz and other health problems uh
 
06:21:17.708 --> 06:21:17.718 align:start position:0%
with brachy the problem isn't with
 
06:21:20.948 --> 06:21:20.958 align:start position:0%
brachy itself it's with any trait in an
 
06:21:23.708 --> 06:21:23.718 align:start position:0%
animal that occurs in the extreme um I
 
06:21:26.110 --> 06:21:26.120 align:start position:0%
would uh respectfully tell you that that
 
06:21:28.788 --> 06:21:28.798 align:start position:0%
the neurologist who testified he sees a
 
06:21:31.230 --> 06:21:31.240 align:start position:0%
very biased population he's a specialist
 
06:21:32.910 --> 06:21:32.920 align:start position:0%
he doesn't see the general pet
 
06:21:35.110 --> 06:21:35.120 align:start position:0%
population I would tell you that most of
 
06:21:37.030 --> 06:21:37.040 align:start position:0%
the braches phalic animals that I see in
 
06:21:39.468 --> 06:21:39.478 align:start position:0%
practice over my 22 years do not suffer
 
06:21:42.070 --> 06:21:42.080 align:start position:0%
from these and it certainly isn't a 90%
 
06:21:44.190 --> 06:21:44.200 align:start position:0%
occurrence in any breed I have research
 
06:21:47.030 --> 06:21:47.040 align:start position:0%
as well that supports that for you um
 
06:21:49.150 --> 06:21:49.160 align:start position:0%
breeding also refers to not just putting
 
06:21:51.030 --> 06:21:51.040 align:start position:0%
two dogs together or two animals
 
06:21:52.590 --> 06:21:52.600 align:start position:0%
together but also the production of
 
06:21:55.708 --> 06:21:55.718 align:start position:0%
those animals so if I breed two non
 
06:21:57.510 --> 06:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
affected animals and come up with an
 
06:22:00.350 --> 06:22:00.360 align:start position:0%
affected animal I could still be held
 
06:22:02.788 --> 06:22:02.798 align:start position:0%
accountable under this law that's the
 
06:22:04.390 --> 06:22:04.400 align:start position:0%
way I interpreted it so this would
 
06:22:06.390 --> 06:22:06.400 align:start position:0%
essentially stop me from ever breeding a
 
06:22:08.788 --> 06:22:08.798 align:start position:0%
dog in the state of New Hampshire again
 
06:22:12.350 --> 06:22:12.360 align:start position:0%
so that is concerning to me the um other
 
06:22:14.948 --> 06:22:14.958 align:start position:0%
issue that I left with you if I can just
 
06:22:16.948 --> 06:22:16.958 align:start position:0%
have one comment is that there's a study
 
06:22:20.590 --> 06:22:20.600 align:start position:0%
that I did reference in my um in my
 
06:22:22.830 --> 06:22:22.840 align:start position:0%
testimony that discusses the impact of
 
06:22:25.788 --> 06:22:25.798 align:start position:0%
an educational intervention on of uh
 
06:22:28.030 --> 06:22:28.040 align:start position:0%
public perception of braches phalic dogs
 
06:22:30.990 --> 06:22:31.000 align:start position:0%
and it showed that 97% of people after
 
06:22:33.230 --> 06:22:33.240 align:start position:0%
given proper Educational Tools about the
 
06:22:35.590 --> 06:22:35.600 align:start position:0%
problems that can happen not that do
 
06:22:35.600 --> 06:22:36.468 align:start position:0%
problems that can happen not that do
always

06:22:36.468 --> 06:22:36.478 align:start position:0%
always
 
06:22:38.788 --> 06:22:38.798 align:start position:0%
happen had a much better understanding
 
06:22:41.270 --> 06:22:41.280 align:start position:0%
of it and were more informed and it is
 
06:22:43.830 --> 06:22:43.840 align:start position:0%
not the skull that equates equates with
 
06:22:45.430 --> 06:22:45.440 align:start position:0%
the dog's problem it's the openness of
 
06:22:47.548 --> 06:22:47.558 align:start position:0%
their nostrils and other ratios in their
 
06:22:50.628 --> 06:22:50.638 align:start position:0%
neck and uh neck and girth and body
 
06:22:52.070 --> 06:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
weight is probably one of the most
 
06:22:56.030 --> 06:22:56.040 align:start position:0%
biggest indicator of Boaz not braisy
 
06:22:57.830 --> 06:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
and that that research has been provided
 
06:22:59.150 --> 06:22:59.160 align:start position:0%
to you in my
 
06:23:02.190 --> 06:23:02.200 align:start position:0%
testimony and I am happy to answer any
 
06:23:04.910 --> 06:23:04.920 align:start position:0%
questions um regarding pet insurance
 
06:23:06.510 --> 06:23:06.520 align:start position:0%
suffering and evaluating an animal for
 
06:23:08.110 --> 06:23:08.120 align:start position:0%
suffering as well as the general pet
 
06:23:10.030 --> 06:23:10.040 align:start position:0%
population and Animal Welfare
 
06:23:12.708 --> 06:23:12.718 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby so it sounds like
 
06:23:14.948 --> 06:23:14.958 align:start position:0%
you're the person to ask my question yes
 
06:23:16.868 --> 06:23:16.878 align:start position:0%
I sat there back there going just yes
 
06:23:20.270 --> 06:23:20.280 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to answer so um so I'm
 
06:23:23.628 --> 06:23:23.638 align:start position:0%
wondering what the procedure is uh if
 
06:23:24.750 --> 06:23:24.760 align:start position:0%
you could just describe what the
 
06:23:27.990 --> 06:23:28.000 align:start position:0%
procedure is for doing an investigation
 
06:23:33.110 --> 06:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
for animal cruelty under uh 648 uh 6448
 
06:23:36.548 --> 06:23:36.558 align:start position:0%
sure so first you know the the complaint
 
06:23:39.030 --> 06:23:39.040 align:start position:0%
must be brought to you know an agency so
 
06:23:40.510 --> 06:23:40.520 align:start position:0%
that would come to either an animal
 
06:23:43.230 --> 06:23:43.240 align:start position:0%
welfare agency or potentially even an
 
06:23:46.430 --> 06:23:46.440 align:start position:0%
attorney general or law enforcement they
 
06:23:47.948 --> 06:23:47.958 align:start position:0%
would reach out to the Animal Welfare or
 
06:23:50.230 --> 06:23:50.240 align:start position:0%
Animal Control Officers who would then
 
06:23:52.868 --> 06:23:52.878 align:start position:0%
go and investigate the complaint
 
06:23:54.510 --> 06:23:54.520 align:start position:0%
sometimes with or without a veterinarian
 
06:23:56.230 --> 06:23:56.240 align:start position:0%
present they don't have a large number
 
06:23:58.270 --> 06:23:58.280 align:start position:0%
of people like me that go out and do
 
06:24:02.788 --> 06:24:02.798 align:start position:0%
that um then if there's probable cause
 
06:24:05.628 --> 06:24:05.638 align:start position:0%
to suspect that the complaint is true
 
06:24:08.468 --> 06:24:08.478 align:start position:0%
then they may go in with a team from the
 
06:24:11.430 --> 06:24:11.440 align:start position:0%
SPCA or from Animal Welfare they then
 
06:24:13.150 --> 06:24:13.160 align:start position:0%
would potentially seize those animals
 
06:24:15.230 --> 06:24:15.240 align:start position:0%
into custody they would come into
 
06:24:17.190 --> 06:24:17.200 align:start position:0%
custody and be examined by somebody like
 
06:24:19.750 --> 06:24:19.760 align:start position:0%
me who then would document all of the
 
06:24:22.150 --> 06:24:22.160 align:start position:0%
health problems that would exist with
 
06:24:24.670 --> 06:24:24.680 align:start position:0%
that population of animals and determine
 
06:24:26.868 --> 06:24:26.878 align:start position:0%
whether or not that animal I don't make
 
06:24:28.590 --> 06:24:28.600 align:start position:0%
the determination of abuse or neglect
 
06:24:31.230 --> 06:24:31.240 align:start position:0%
that's jurisdictionally determined but I
 
06:24:34.230 --> 06:24:34.240 align:start position:0%
would make my opinion about the
 
06:24:36.110 --> 06:24:36.120 align:start position:0%
condition of that animal and whether it
 
06:24:39.350 --> 06:24:39.360 align:start position:0%
was something that was neglect or
 
06:24:45.110 --> 06:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
abuse follow up so um given that
 
06:24:48.910 --> 06:24:48.920 align:start position:0%
um with the description with uh the
 
06:24:52.750 --> 06:24:52.760 align:start position:0%
description of animal abuse that is uh
 
06:24:55.548 --> 06:24:55.558 align:start position:0%
create would be created by this bill how
 
06:24:58.230 --> 06:24:58.240 align:start position:0%
would that be dealt with it can't be
 
06:25:01.468 --> 06:25:01.478 align:start position:0%
it's impossible absolutely impossible
 
06:25:03.990 --> 06:25:04.000 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
06:25:06.030 --> 06:25:06.040 align:start position:0%
Murray thank you madam chair and thank
 
06:25:08.350 --> 06:25:08.360 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question so I guess
 
06:25:10.510 --> 06:25:10.520 align:start position:0%
with regard to the I think it was one of
 
06:25:14.390 --> 06:25:14.400 align:start position:0%
the previous speakers and your testimony
 
06:25:17.830 --> 06:25:17.840 align:start position:0%
um with the possibility of animals being
 
06:25:23.030 --> 06:25:23.040 align:start position:0%
removed from the the Y sure right the
 
06:25:24.590 --> 06:25:24.600 align:start position:0%
possession of anyone and that is during
 
06:25:25.948 --> 06:25:25.958 align:start position:0%
the investigation
 
06:25:29.070 --> 06:25:29.080 align:start position:0%
process pre-trial potentially as the
 
06:25:30.548 --> 06:25:30.558 align:start position:0%
investigation process is going on if
 
06:25:32.628 --> 06:25:32.638 align:start position:0%
there's probable cause to support the
 
06:25:34.190 --> 06:25:34.200 align:start position:0%
bringing of charges against somebody for
 
06:25:36.628 --> 06:25:36.638 align:start position:0%
animal cruelty abuse or neglect then
 
06:25:38.948 --> 06:25:38.958 align:start position:0%
those animals can be seized follow up if
 
06:25:42.948 --> 06:25:42.958 align:start position:0%
I may follow up Y and do you find that
 
06:25:46.788 --> 06:25:46.798 align:start position:0%
in this bill that is a potential
 
06:25:50.788 --> 06:25:50.798 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you okay any other
 
06:25:52.430 --> 06:25:52.440 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
06:25:55.628 --> 06:25:55.638 align:start position:0%
committee yeah representative ktoa thank
 
06:25:57.670 --> 06:25:57.680 align:start position:0%
you madam chair and uh thank you for
 
06:26:01.310 --> 06:26:01.320 align:start position:0%
taking my question um just so I
 
06:26:02.590 --> 06:26:02.600 align:start position:0%
understand everything and everything
 
06:26:03.670 --> 06:26:03.680 align:start position:0%
we've been
 
06:26:07.830 --> 06:26:07.840 align:start position:0%
hearing brachy seil is a description of
 
06:26:10.948 --> 06:26:10.958 align:start position:0%
an animal being flat-faced or flath
 
06:26:13.788 --> 06:26:13.798 align:start position:0%
headed is that correct I would say it's
 
06:26:15.548 --> 06:26:15.558 align:start position:0%
the and there's no one universal
 
06:26:16.910 --> 06:26:16.920 align:start position:0%
definition as evidence by one of the
 
06:26:20.070 --> 06:26:20.080 align:start position:0%
studies I gave you but brachy sefali is
 
06:26:23.830 --> 06:26:23.840 align:start position:0%
typically used to a wide flat skull it's
 
06:26:26.708 --> 06:26:26.718 align:start position:0%
not always flat face so this poster here
 
06:26:28.350 --> 06:26:28.360 align:start position:0%
shows you all the different animals and
 
06:26:30.868 --> 06:26:30.878 align:start position:0%
not all of them but many EX examples of
 
06:26:32.548 --> 06:26:32.558 align:start position:0%
perfectly healthy animals that are
 
06:26:35.310 --> 06:26:35.320 align:start position:0%
Breaky spalc and by this bill and the
 
06:26:36.830 --> 06:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
wording of this bill would fall under
 
06:26:40.310 --> 06:26:40.320 align:start position:0%
animal cruelty follow up thank you for
 
06:26:42.708 --> 06:26:42.718 align:start position:0%
that having owned two of the breeds that
 
06:26:44.590 --> 06:26:44.600 align:start position:0%
are considered
 
06:26:47.910 --> 06:26:47.920 align:start position:0%
Ries um under this because it's just a
 
06:26:51.270 --> 06:26:51.280 align:start position:0%
definition and not a condition could it
 
06:26:53.230 --> 06:26:53.240 align:start position:0%
would it be possible for anyone owning
 
06:26:55.990 --> 06:26:56.000 align:start position:0%
those animals to be considered in
 
06:27:00.430 --> 06:27:00.440 align:start position:0%
violation um because they're owning an
 
06:27:03.868 --> 06:27:03.878 align:start position:0%
animal so I'm just wondering where could
 
06:27:05.390 --> 06:27:05.400 align:start position:0%
they be seized I
 
06:27:08.350 --> 06:27:08.360 align:start position:0%
mean under this the ownership isn't what
 
06:27:10.110 --> 06:27:10.120 align:start position:0%
is as my understanding of the bill is
 
06:27:11.628 --> 06:27:11.638 align:start position:0%
written it's not ownership that's the
 
06:27:14.990 --> 06:27:15.000 align:start position:0%
problem okay it's it's the breeding of
 
06:27:16.948 --> 06:27:16.958 align:start position:0%
these animals and this bill the problem
 
06:27:19.750 --> 06:27:19.760 align:start position:0%
I see is it can be applied retroactively
 
06:27:22.390 --> 06:27:22.400 align:start position:0%
because I willingly bred this litter you
 
06:27:24.910 --> 06:27:24.920 align:start position:0%
know I intentionally bred a litter I may
 
06:27:28.150 --> 06:27:28.160 align:start position:0%
have had unforeseen consequences of that
 
06:27:30.270 --> 06:27:30.280 align:start position:0%
breeding and please understand everybody
 
06:27:31.830 --> 06:27:31.840 align:start position:0%
talked about the genetics and all of
 
06:27:34.190 --> 06:27:34.200 align:start position:0%
that that really doesn't take into
 
06:27:35.830 --> 06:27:35.840 align:start position:0%
account the genetics is not black and
 
06:27:38.270 --> 06:27:38.280 align:start position:0%
white there are environmental influences
 
06:27:40.548 --> 06:27:40.558 align:start position:0%
that dictate whether or not an animal
 
06:27:42.190 --> 06:27:42.200 align:start position:0%
develops something that could or could
 
06:27:44.350 --> 06:27:44.360 align:start position:0%
not be genetic there's also a field
 
06:27:46.590 --> 06:27:46.600 align:start position:0%
called epigenetics that changes a dog's
 
06:27:51.868 --> 06:27:51.878 align:start position:0%
DNA at its core to then produce you know
 
06:27:54.708 --> 06:27:54.718 align:start position:0%
undesirable things representative comor
 
06:27:56.510 --> 06:27:56.520 align:start position:0%
follow thank thank you madam chair and
 
06:27:58.270 --> 06:27:58.280 align:start position:0%
thank you again for taking my question
 
06:28:01.868 --> 06:28:01.878 align:start position:0%
sure so if what if someone was breeding
 
06:28:03.548 --> 06:28:03.558 align:start position:0%
these animals and they're perfectly
 
06:28:05.910 --> 06:28:05.920 align:start position:0%
healthy could the environment in which
 
06:28:08.110 --> 06:28:08.120 align:start position:0%
they're being raised cause some of these
 
06:28:10.628 --> 06:28:10.638 align:start position:0%
issues I'm so glad you asked me that
 
06:28:13.030 --> 06:28:13.040 align:start position:0%
question um let's take hip dysplasia if
 
06:28:15.548 --> 06:28:15.558 align:start position:0%
you ask me as a 22-year practicing
 
06:28:18.230 --> 06:28:18.240 align:start position:0%
veterinarian the number one disease
 
06:28:21.910 --> 06:28:21.920 align:start position:0%
process that causes suffering in animals
 
06:28:23.708 --> 06:28:23.718 align:start position:0%
I would tell you it's hip dysplasia
 
06:28:25.990 --> 06:28:26.000 align:start position:0%
happens in tons of of breeds lots of
 
06:28:29.270 --> 06:28:29.280 align:start position:0%
large dogs that disease is not only
 
06:28:32.150 --> 06:28:32.160 align:start position:0%
genetic it's multifactorial it comes to
 
06:28:34.590 --> 06:28:34.600 align:start position:0%
diet exercise the flooring on which it
 
06:28:37.310 --> 06:28:37.320 align:start position:0%
was raised as a puppy it can be um the
 
06:28:38.948 --> 06:28:38.958 align:start position:0%
flooring that it's raised in you know in
 
06:28:40.788 --> 06:28:40.798 align:start position:0%
a household people who have slick floors
 
06:28:42.948 --> 06:28:42.958 align:start position:0%
who have wood floors like we do you know
 
06:28:45.430 --> 06:28:45.440 align:start position:0%
that dog will be more predisposed so
 
06:28:48.150 --> 06:28:48.160 align:start position:0%
correlation does not equal causation and
 
06:28:49.750 --> 06:28:49.760 align:start position:0%
that's what I I really hope that this
 
06:28:51.990 --> 06:28:52.000 align:start position:0%
committee can understand brachy spyic
 
06:28:53.990 --> 06:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
breeds yes do they have Boaz sure do
 
06:28:56.230 --> 06:28:56.240 align:start position:0%
they have other issues sure but it
 
06:28:58.430 --> 06:28:58.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean by virtue of their breed or
 
06:29:00.910 --> 06:29:00.920 align:start position:0%
the brachy that they're going to have it
 
06:29:03.150 --> 06:29:03.160 align:start position:0%
they're correlated but they're not
 
06:29:06.788 --> 06:29:06.798 align:start position:0%
necessarily caused by that the idea that
 
06:29:09.548 --> 06:29:09.558 align:start position:0%
um by having a dog with a flatter skull
 
06:29:11.548 --> 06:29:11.558 align:start position:0%
that it's necessarily going to have this
 
06:29:14.670 --> 06:29:14.680 align:start position:0%
no their their body weight determines
 
06:29:16.110 --> 06:29:16.120 align:start position:0%
whether they can regulate their body
 
06:29:18.350 --> 06:29:18.360 align:start position:0%
temperature much more so the studies
 
06:29:20.150 --> 06:29:20.160 align:start position:0%
that I've given you show that the number
 
06:29:23.150 --> 06:29:23.160 align:start position:0%
one contributor is not the length of
 
06:29:25.708 --> 06:29:25.718 align:start position:0%
their muzzle but yet their body weight
 
06:29:27.910 --> 06:29:27.920 align:start position:0%
and their girth of their neck I mean so
 
06:29:30.190 --> 06:29:30.200 align:start position:0%
I mean these are scientific studies and
 
06:29:33.430 --> 06:29:33.440 align:start position:0%
I I just don't um 90% of Frenchies do
 
06:29:35.510 --> 06:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
not have Boaz I'm sorry I don't know
 
06:29:36.990 --> 06:29:37.000 align:start position:0%
where those statistics come from I've
 
06:29:38.788 --> 06:29:38.798 align:start position:0%
done my
 
06:29:42.468 --> 06:29:42.478 align:start position:0%
research any other questions from the
 
06:29:44.868 --> 06:29:44.878 align:start position:0%
committee okay
 
06:29:48.030 --> 06:29:48.040 align:start position:0%
um I you know I
 
06:29:51.910 --> 06:29:51.920 align:start position:0%
um I have to again we you know we're
 
06:29:53.830 --> 06:29:53.840 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
06:29:57.150 --> 06:29:57.160 align:start position:0%
um just dogs actually we've been talking
 
06:29:59.590 --> 06:29:59.600 align:start position:0%
all day dogs with u
 
06:29:59.600 --> 06:30:01.150 align:start position:0%
all day dogs with u
braisy

06:30:01.150 --> 06:30:01.160 align:start position:0%
braisy
 
06:30:05.430 --> 06:30:05.440 align:start position:0%
but are there are there any
 
06:30:09.788 --> 06:30:09.798 align:start position:0%
other any other uh and is this is this
 
06:30:12.190 --> 06:30:12.200 align:start position:0%
really a deformity I'm just no it is it
 
06:30:14.750 --> 06:30:14.760 align:start position:0%
occurs in nature and that's you know in
 
06:30:16.948 --> 06:30:16.958 align:start position:0%
my testimony I talk about birds PE I
 
06:30:19.350 --> 06:30:19.360 align:start position:0%
mean animals adapt to their environment
 
06:30:22.510 --> 06:30:22.520 align:start position:0%
now you know certainly brachy in an
 
06:30:24.310 --> 06:30:24.320 align:start position:0%
extreme case can be breed to be
 
06:30:24.320 --> 06:30:25.590 align:start position:0%
extreme case can be breed to be
undesirable

06:30:25.590 --> 06:30:25.600 align:start position:0%
undesirable
 
06:30:28.390 --> 06:30:28.400 align:start position:0%
but animals are naturally braic in
 
06:30:30.390 --> 06:30:30.400 align:start position:0%
undomesticated species as well as
 
06:30:33.548 --> 06:30:33.558 align:start position:0%
domesticated species and they they do
 
06:30:35.390 --> 06:30:35.400 align:start position:0%
have adaptations that occur based on
 
06:30:37.670 --> 06:30:37.680 align:start position:0%
their environment and so no it is a
 
06:30:40.030 --> 06:30:40.040 align:start position:0%
descriptor and not a deformity or
 
06:30:41.948 --> 06:30:41.958 align:start position:0%
condition absolutely not it's not
 
06:30:43.910 --> 06:30:43.920 align:start position:0%
recognized in any Veterinary textbook as
 
06:30:43.920 --> 06:30:45.510 align:start position:0%
recognized in any Veterinary textbook as
an

06:30:45.510 --> 06:30:45.520 align:start position:0%
an
 
06:30:50.830 --> 06:30:50.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:54.310 --> 06:30:54.320 align:start position:0%
um breathing disorders I mean aside from
 
06:30:57.628 --> 06:30:57.638 align:start position:0%
asthma kind of things that are uh traits
 
06:31:00.230 --> 06:31:00.240 align:start position:0%
of certain other animals there are a lot
 
06:31:02.150 --> 06:31:02.160 align:start position:0%
of breathing dis breathing disorders
 
06:31:05.708 --> 06:31:05.718 align:start position:0%
that are traits in many animals um
 
06:31:08.190 --> 06:31:08.200 align:start position:0%
feline asthma is is one of them I mean
 
06:31:10.070 --> 06:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
that's a that's a condition that's very
 
06:31:12.468 --> 06:31:12.478 align:start position:0%
you know not related to break esopo but
 
06:31:14.750 --> 06:31:14.760 align:start position:0%
it is a condition that's common um you
 
06:31:16.868 --> 06:31:16.878 align:start position:0%
know animals have pulmonary disease for
 
06:31:18.788 --> 06:31:18.798 align:start position:0%
a wide variety infectious reasons
 
06:31:20.468 --> 06:31:20.478 align:start position:0%
tickborne reasons I mean there many many
 
06:31:21.590 --> 06:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
things that could cause breathing
 
06:31:24.230 --> 06:31:24.240 align:start position:0%
difficulties but from a from a and I
 
06:31:26.030 --> 06:31:26.040 align:start position:0%
think you're we're overly focused on
 
06:31:28.788 --> 06:31:28.798 align:start position:0%
breathing because there there's just so
 
06:31:32.948 --> 06:31:32.958 align:start position:0%
many disorders in animals that can occur
 
06:31:36.190 --> 06:31:36.200 align:start position:0%
based on um a breed it's you know based
 
06:31:38.190 --> 06:31:38.200 align:start position:0%
on any breed even non- breed I mean you
 
06:31:40.110 --> 06:31:40.120 align:start position:0%
can take two like the Doodles are not
 
06:31:42.070 --> 06:31:42.080 align:start position:0%
pure bread everybody loves Doodles those
 
06:31:43.788 --> 06:31:43.798 align:start position:0%
are some of the most unhealthy animals I
 
06:31:45.868 --> 06:31:45.878 align:start position:0%
see in practice they all have skin
 
06:31:47.868 --> 06:31:47.878 align:start position:0%
allergies I mean almost all of them and
 
06:31:49.388 --> 06:31:49.398 align:start position:0%
they their owners are spending thousands
 
06:31:50.548 --> 06:31:50.558 align:start position:0%
of dollars they're on chronic
 
06:31:52.910 --> 06:31:52.920 align:start position:0%
medications for their life so you know
 
06:31:55.350 --> 06:31:55.360 align:start position:0%
the general population is not the
 
06:31:56.910 --> 06:31:56.920 align:start position:0%
extreme that you're being presented here
 
06:31:58.670 --> 06:31:58.680 align:start position:0%
today and I just really want you to
 
06:32:01.510 --> 06:32:01.520 align:start position:0%
understand 22 years is an emergency vet
 
06:32:02.990 --> 06:32:03.000 align:start position:0%
I don't think that I have
 
06:32:03.000 --> 06:32:04.670 align:start position:0%
I don't think that I have
[Music]

06:32:04.670 --> 06:32:04.680 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:32:08.230 --> 06:32:08.240 align:start position:0%
seen 10 Boaz affected dogs to the point
 
06:32:10.310 --> 06:32:10.320 align:start position:0%
where they were suffering and dying I
 
06:32:11.830 --> 06:32:11.840 align:start position:0%
mean we're talking about I'm not that it
 
06:32:14.230 --> 06:32:14.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't happen and I'm one veterinarian
 
06:32:15.388 --> 06:32:15.398 align:start position:0%
but this isn't something that comes
 
06:32:17.830 --> 06:32:17.840 align:start position:0%
through my door every day okay this is
 
06:32:19.670 --> 06:32:19.680 align:start position:0%
this is definitely not the New Hampshire
 
06:32:21.788 --> 06:32:21.798 align:start position:0%
population of
 
06:32:25.910 --> 06:32:25.920 align:start position:0%
dogs Okay so this we're talking a lot
 
06:32:30.350 --> 06:32:30.360 align:start position:0%
about um skull structure yes here but in
 
06:32:34.310 --> 06:32:34.320 align:start position:0%
terms of other parts of animals can they
 
06:32:37.628 --> 06:32:37.638 align:start position:0%
also have uh some structures that would
 
06:32:40.190 --> 06:32:40.200 align:start position:0%
quote unquote cause suffering suffering
 
06:32:42.230 --> 06:32:42.240 align:start position:0%
absolutely um take York Yorkshire
 
06:32:44.868 --> 06:32:44.878 align:start position:0%
Terriers I mean those cute little yorkis
 
06:32:46.670 --> 06:32:46.680 align:start position:0%
I can tell you that many of those their
 
06:32:48.708 --> 06:32:48.718 align:start position:0%
livers develop more slowly in their
 
06:32:51.590 --> 06:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
ability to um regulate their blood
 
06:32:55.110 --> 06:32:55.120 align:start position:0%
sugars okay and I see weekly see very
 
06:32:56.670 --> 06:32:56.680 align:start position:0%
small breed dogs come in because they
 
06:32:58.030 --> 06:32:58.040 align:start position:0%
can't regulate their blood sugars and
 
06:32:59.430 --> 06:32:59.440 align:start position:0%
then they're in the hospital on IVs and
 
06:33:01.548 --> 06:33:01.558 align:start position:0%
dextr strips and things to bring that up
 
06:33:03.030 --> 06:33:03.040 align:start position:0%
and the owners have to give that animal
 
06:33:05.628 --> 06:33:05.638 align:start position:0%
Special Care liver shuns are a great
 
06:33:07.150 --> 06:33:07.160 align:start position:0%
example of that there are internal
 
06:33:08.948 --> 06:33:08.958 align:start position:0%
things that you can't see from the
 
06:33:12.030 --> 06:33:12.040 align:start position:0%
outside that you know animals can suffer
 
06:33:13.708 --> 06:33:13.718 align:start position:0%
but they but many of these things can be
 
06:33:16.948 --> 06:33:16.958 align:start position:0%
medically or surgically managed and or
 
06:33:18.868 --> 06:33:18.878 align:start position:0%
or husbandry practices even keeping a
 
06:33:20.910 --> 06:33:20.920 align:start position:0%
dog at the right weight goes a long way
 
06:33:22.708 --> 06:33:22.718 align:start position:0%
to solving a lot of these problems as
 
06:33:25.670 --> 06:33:25.680 align:start position:0%
well okay thank you representative
 
06:33:27.830 --> 06:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
German thank you madam chair thank you
 
06:33:29.150 --> 06:33:29.160 align:start position:0%
very much for your testimony for
 
06:33:30.590 --> 06:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
answering my question so what I'm
 
06:33:32.548 --> 06:33:32.558 align:start position:0%
struggling here with is I understand
 
06:33:34.548 --> 06:33:34.558 align:start position:0%
certain breeds are prone to certain
 
06:33:37.030 --> 06:33:37.040 align:start position:0%
disorders right as certain genetic
 
06:33:38.750 --> 06:33:38.760 align:start position:0%
groups and human populations are prone
 
06:33:40.030 --> 06:33:40.040 align:start position:0%
to certain disorders right but the
 
06:33:41.590 --> 06:33:41.600 align:start position:0%
question here has to do with artificial
 
06:33:44.510 --> 06:33:44.520 align:start position:0%
selection right so are there other
 
06:33:48.190 --> 06:33:48.200 align:start position:0%
comparable cases where a specific
 
06:33:50.948 --> 06:33:50.958 align:start position:0%
aesthetic feature for which animals are
 
06:33:54.830 --> 06:33:54.840 align:start position:0%
bred have a comparably high correlation
 
06:33:57.868 --> 06:33:57.878 align:start position:0%
to a specific disorder right because I
 
06:33:59.430 --> 06:33:59.440 align:start position:0%
understand certain breeds have certain
 
06:34:01.230 --> 06:34:01.240 align:start position:0%
disorders but what I'm struggling with
 
06:34:03.708 --> 06:34:03.718 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that whatever the
 
06:34:07.070 --> 06:34:07.080 align:start position:0%
percentage is there is a correlation a
 
06:34:09.270 --> 06:34:09.280 align:start position:0%
stronger correlation between certain
 
06:34:11.350 --> 06:34:11.360 align:start position:0%
physical features that are intentionally
 
06:34:14.070 --> 06:34:14.080 align:start position:0%
selected for okay and
 
06:34:16.670 --> 06:34:16.680 align:start position:0%
certain uh medical conditions or we
 
06:34:18.910 --> 06:34:18.920 align:start position:0%
could talk about invertebral dis disease
 
06:34:20.510 --> 06:34:20.520 align:start position:0%
long back dogs you know you have a
 
06:34:22.750 --> 06:34:22.760 align:start position:0%
longer spine certainly they're more
 
06:34:25.430 --> 06:34:25.440 align:start position:0%
prone in their daily life to wind up
 
06:34:28.070 --> 06:34:28.080 align:start position:0%
having you know in vetal disc disease
 
06:34:29.150 --> 06:34:29.160 align:start position:0%
that can be life-ending and
 
06:34:32.430 --> 06:34:32.440 align:start position:0%
life-changing for a dog you can um have
 
06:34:34.590 --> 06:34:34.600 align:start position:0%
I can go back to hip dysplasia dogs that
 
06:34:37.030 --> 06:34:37.040 align:start position:0%
are bred for a certain bone structure
 
06:34:38.910 --> 06:34:38.920 align:start position:0%
and the slope of their back and just
 
06:34:41.910 --> 06:34:41.920 align:start position:0%
their confirmation in general can have
 
06:34:44.030 --> 06:34:44.040 align:start position:0%
hip dysplasia I mean so there there are
 
06:34:46.948 --> 06:34:46.958 align:start position:0%
many of these examples but I think we're
 
06:34:50.070 --> 06:34:50.080 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily focused on one condition
 
06:34:52.708 --> 06:34:52.718 align:start position:0%
and you know and braak eepy I think this
 
06:34:54.548 --> 06:34:54.558 align:start position:0%
unfortunately would then extend to the
 
06:34:57.030 --> 06:34:57.040 align:start position:0%
greater population and a lot of times I
 
06:35:00.030 --> 06:35:00.040 align:start position:0%
can do as a breeder the best job that I
 
06:35:03.190 --> 06:35:03.200 align:start position:0%
can to ensure the health of a litter and
 
06:35:05.430 --> 06:35:05.440 align:start position:0%
I you know and do all my health testing
 
06:35:07.350 --> 06:35:07.360 align:start position:0%
and clearances and everything else and
 
06:35:09.750 --> 06:35:09.760 align:start position:0%
breed the best of what I have and
 
06:35:11.708 --> 06:35:11.718 align:start position:0%
something can go wrong either not
 
06:35:13.788 --> 06:35:13.798 align:start position:0%
genetically but developmentally from
 
06:35:17.388 --> 06:35:17.398 align:start position:0%
embryonic development or um or even
 
06:35:19.670 --> 06:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
environmental influences to cause some
 
06:35:21.430 --> 06:35:21.440 align:start position:0%
of these things and we can't control for
 
06:35:23.510 --> 06:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
that we just can't it's Mother Nature
 
06:35:25.190 --> 06:35:25.200 align:start position:0%
you know it's very helpful thank you
 
06:35:27.750 --> 06:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
very much thank you thank you any other
 
06:35:29.150 --> 06:35:29.160 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
06:35:31.110 --> 06:35:31.120 align:start position:0%
committee thank you very much for your
 
06:35:33.350 --> 06:35:33.360 align:start position:0%
testimony it was very helpful
 
06:35:33.360 --> 06:35:53.310 align:start position:0%
testimony it was very helpful
today

06:35:53.310 --> 06:35:53.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:53.320 --> 06:35:57.628 align:start position:0%
 
okay

06:35:57.628 --> 06:35:57.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:00.548 --> 06:36:00.558 align:start position:0%
okay all right um so we have one two
 
06:36:04.270 --> 06:36:04.280 align:start position:0%
three four five six 78 people uh who
 
06:36:07.230 --> 06:36:07.240 align:start position:0%
have submitted pink cards and if you
 
06:36:09.590 --> 06:36:09.600 align:start position:0%
have something I if you were planning on
 
06:36:11.110 --> 06:36:11.120 align:start position:0%
saying something that somebody's already
 
06:36:13.548 --> 06:36:13.558 align:start position:0%
said um it would be appreciated if you
 
06:36:16.948 --> 06:36:16.958 align:start position:0%
waved off but uh because time is running
 
06:36:23.270 --> 06:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:23.280 --> 06:36:33.868 align:start position:0%
 
ducet

06:36:33.868 --> 06:36:33.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:35.948 --> 06:36:35.958 align:start position:0%
and thank you I'll I'll be brief because
 
06:36:38.910 --> 06:36:38.920 align:start position:0%
a lot of it's been touched upon but um
 
06:36:42.628 --> 06:36:42.638 align:start position:0%
firstly dly s set I am strongly oppose
 
06:36:44.910 --> 06:36:44.920 align:start position:0%
this bill I don't come to you as a
 
06:36:49.628 --> 06:36:49.638 align:start position:0%
breeder a vet but purely a a pet
 
06:36:53.110 --> 06:36:53.120 align:start position:0%
Enthusiast and I happen to own a dog in
 
06:36:54.788 --> 06:36:54.798 align:start position:0%
this targeted group that we're talking
 
06:36:57.350 --> 06:36:57.360 align:start position:0%
about today but understand that with the
 
06:36:58.910 --> 06:36:58.920 align:start position:0%
lingo in this
 
06:37:01.548 --> 06:37:01.558 align:start position:0%
bill it certainly is a slippery slope
 
06:37:03.708 --> 06:37:03.718 align:start position:0%
but to me it can Cascade and kind of
 
06:37:05.788 --> 06:37:05.798 align:start position:0%
focus on what I would consider
 
06:37:08.628 --> 06:37:08.638 align:start position:0%
characteristics of breeds and start to
 
06:37:10.868 --> 06:37:10.878 align:start position:0%
think that that is a deformity I think
 
06:37:12.788 --> 06:37:12.798 align:start position:0%
what we should be doing is promoting
 
06:37:15.948 --> 06:37:15.958 align:start position:0%
again these reputable breeders to that
 
06:37:18.868 --> 06:37:18.878 align:start position:0%
have the lifetime contracts with their
 
06:37:21.150 --> 06:37:21.160 align:start position:0%
customers like me I happen to own a
 
06:37:23.270 --> 06:37:23.280 align:start position:0%
German shepherd and I actually happen to
 
06:37:25.990 --> 06:37:26.000 align:start position:0%
own an Old English Bulldog name Olive
 
06:37:28.388 --> 06:37:28.398 align:start position:0%
she I have lifetime contract with my
 
06:37:30.548 --> 06:37:30.558 align:start position:0%
breeders I'm I could contact them
 
06:37:33.510 --> 06:37:33.520 align:start position:0%
anytime they've all been Health tested
 
06:37:35.510 --> 06:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
so I think that's kind of the road we
 
06:37:39.030 --> 06:37:39.040 align:start position:0%
all want to go down and as an aside one
 
06:37:41.910 --> 06:37:41.920 align:start position:0%
reason why we did get our Bulldog
 
06:37:43.070 --> 06:37:43.080 align:start position:0%
because we didn't know much about the
 
06:37:45.190 --> 06:37:45.200 align:start position:0%
breed so we did our research found a
 
06:37:49.628 --> 06:37:49.638 align:start position:0%
breeder in Maine and um this breeder
 
06:37:51.990 --> 06:37:52.000 align:start position:0%
produced the Bulldog that is the current
 
06:37:55.150 --> 06:37:55.160 align:start position:0%
mascot at Yale okay they did lifetime
 
06:37:57.468 --> 06:37:57.478 align:start position:0%
you know uh search throughout the US
 
06:37:59.270 --> 06:37:59.280 align:start position:0%
settled on this breeder and so far they
 
06:38:02.270 --> 06:38:02.280 align:start position:0%
have two his name is handsome Dan he has
 
06:38:05.510 --> 06:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
an Instagram page you can follow it he
 
06:38:08.830 --> 06:38:08.840 align:start position:0%
and I assure you he has a very robust
 
06:38:14.110 --> 06:38:14.120 align:start position:0%
active you know uh lifestyle okay so and
 
06:38:16.948 --> 06:38:16.958 align:start position:0%
lastly just to wrap it up I did I didn't
 
06:38:19.468 --> 06:38:19.478 align:start position:0%
make copies I apologize I did email you
 
06:38:21.388 --> 06:38:21.398 align:start position:0%
all and I'd be very happy to walk that
 
06:38:23.628 --> 06:38:23.638 align:start position:0%
over so thank you for your time any
 
06:38:26.708 --> 06:38:26.718 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee seeing none
 
06:38:33.280 --> 06:38:33.290 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:33.290 --> 06:38:49.430 align:start position:0%

Richardson hello my name's Diane
 
06:38:53.030 --> 06:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
Richardson I'm from Springfield New

Hampshire I've been
 
06:38:56.628 --> 06:38:56.638 align:start position:0%
involved with dogs both professionally
 
06:38:59.430 --> 06:38:59.440 align:start position:0%
and as a hobby for 39 years in the
 
06:39:01.030 --> 06:39:01.040 align:start position:0%
interest of time I'll just hit three
 
06:39:03.548 --> 06:39:03.558 align:start position:0%
points I emailed you the full testimony
 
06:39:06.270 --> 06:39:06.280 align:start position:0%
last Thursday um it contains a whole lot
 
06:39:08.310 --> 06:39:08.320 align:start position:0%
of information I'm
 
06:39:11.110 --> 06:39:11.120 align:start position:0%
sorry uh the three points are one how
 
06:39:15.310 --> 06:39:15.320 align:start position:0%
will brachy be diagnosed there are six
 
06:39:18.070 --> 06:39:18.080 align:start position:0%
different methods and four thresholds
 
06:39:21.110 --> 06:39:21.120 align:start position:0%
within those that can be used to define
 
06:39:24.030 --> 06:39:24.040 align:start position:0%
and diagnose a brachy cilic animal which
 
06:39:27.468 --> 06:39:27.478 align:start position:0%
which I detailed in my email just two of
 
06:39:31.030 --> 06:39:31.040 align:start position:0%
these methods are muzzle ratio the ratio
 
06:39:33.270 --> 06:39:33.280 align:start position:0%
of the muzzle to the total head length
 
06:39:35.548 --> 06:39:35.558 align:start position:0%
and a muzzle length below
 
06:39:38.150 --> 06:39:38.160 align:start position:0%
33% of the total head length will is
 
06:39:42.030 --> 06:39:42.040 align:start position:0%
diagnosed as breis spyic or the syphilic
 
06:39:45.270 --> 06:39:45.280 align:start position:0%
index is a second one uh some people use
 
06:39:47.270 --> 06:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
the syphilic index which is actually a
 
06:39:50.548 --> 06:39:50.558 align:start position:0%
measuring system created for human
 
06:39:53.388 --> 06:39:53.398 align:start position:0%
infants those using the syphilic index
 
06:39:53.398 --> 06:39:54.750 align:start position:0%
infants those using the syphilic index
Define

06:39:54.750 --> 06:39:54.760 align:start position:0%
Define
 
06:39:56.910 --> 06:39:56.920 align:start position:0%
as those animals scoring over one of
 
06:39:59.830 --> 06:39:59.840 align:start position:0%
three different thresholds either 60
 
06:40:04.310 --> 06:40:04.320 align:start position:0%
plus or 80 plus or 100 plus using the
 
06:40:07.590 --> 06:40:07.600 align:start position:0%
syphilic index many breeds of dogs cats
 
06:40:09.150 --> 06:40:09.160 align:start position:0%
and even
 
06:40:12.708 --> 06:40:12.718 align:start position:0%
livestock uh that are not flat-faced
 
06:40:15.350 --> 06:40:15.360 align:start position:0%
will score as brais spalc Cooney Cooney
 
06:40:16.430 --> 06:40:16.440 align:start position:0%
pigs for
 
06:40:18.990 --> 06:40:19.000 align:start position:0%
example here are my two dogs chance and
 
06:40:22.190 --> 06:40:22.200 align:start position:0%
Jenny do they fit your mental definition
 
06:40:24.190 --> 06:40:24.200 align:start position:0%
of a brachy stolic dog I'm I'm going to
 
06:40:24.200 --> 06:40:25.310 align:start position:0%
of a brachy stolic dog I'm I'm going to
guess

06:40:25.310 --> 06:40:25.320 align:start position:0%
guess
 
06:40:28.510 --> 06:40:28.520 align:start position:0%
no uh chance scores 82 on the syphilic
 
06:40:30.670 --> 06:40:30.680 align:start position:0%
index Jenny scores
 
06:40:33.270 --> 06:40:33.280 align:start position:0%

deformity some deformities could be that
 
06:40:56.830 --> 06:40:56.840 align:start position:0%
could potentially cause suffering could
 
06:40:59.750 --> 06:40:59.760 align:start position:0%

06:41:16.230 --> 06:41:16.240 align:start position:0%
have to cut you off because you met your
 
06:41:19.310 --> 06:41:19.320 align:start position:0%
three minutes and then some um any
 
06:41:21.510 --> 06:41:21.520 align:start position:0%
questions for Miss
 
06:41:23.910 --> 06:41:23.920 align:start position:0%
Richardson seeing none thank you we
 
06:41:27.070 --> 06:41:27.080 align:start position:0%
appreciate you hanging in
 
06:41:48.708 --> 06:41:48.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:52.030 --> 06:41:52.040 align:start position:0%
Farley cop of problem this this is one
 
06:41:54.830 --> 06:41:54.840 align:start position:0%
of the ones that has
 
06:42:13.468 --> 06:42:13.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:16.590 --> 06:42:16.600 align:start position:0%
you I am opposed to the bill I don't
 
06:42:19.270 --> 06:42:19.280 align:start position:0%
have this breed I never have but I have
 
06:42:21.670 --> 06:42:21.680 align:start position:0%
doberan and there's issues there that
 
06:42:23.990 --> 06:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
people could come back to us on on that
 
06:42:26.750 --> 06:42:26.760 align:start position:0%
but what I've did is I did a history
 
06:42:29.430 --> 06:42:29.440 align:start position:0%
on all the some of the breeds that are
 
06:42:32.510 --> 06:42:32.520 align:start position:0%
in there that are you know considered
 
06:42:35.030 --> 06:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
deformed I you know their lifespan
 
06:42:37.190 --> 06:42:37.200 align:start position:0%
that's what's missing on the majority of
 
06:42:38.708 --> 06:42:38.718 align:start position:0%
my things because of my like I said my
 
06:42:43.070 --> 06:42:43.080 align:start position:0%
computer my prints are problem um but
 
06:42:44.510 --> 06:42:44.520 align:start position:0%
the only thing I want to mention about
 
06:42:46.468 --> 06:42:46.478 align:start position:0%
all these other dogs other than the
 
06:42:50.590 --> 06:42:50.600 align:start position:0%
Neapolitan Mastiff they all do um fast
 
06:42:52.708 --> 06:42:52.718 align:start position:0%
cat or coursing ability which is all
 
06:42:55.230 --> 06:42:55.240 align:start position:0%
running fast cat a 100 yards straight
 
06:42:57.708 --> 06:42:57.718 align:start position:0%
down and they take the seconds and put
 
06:43:01.430 --> 06:43:01.440 align:start position:0%
it into miles per hour so you know every
 
06:43:02.670 --> 06:43:02.680 align:start position:0%
one of those
 
06:43:05.590 --> 06:43:05.600 align:start position:0%
breeds do fast cat or coursing they do
 
06:43:09.070 --> 06:43:09.080 align:start position:0%
obedience they do rally and I just you
 
06:43:11.230 --> 06:43:11.240 align:start position:0%
know if there's an issue that's where
 
06:43:13.030 --> 06:43:13.040 align:start position:0%
it's going to come up I would think big
 
06:43:16.430 --> 06:43:16.440 align:start position:0%
time and to see so many different dogs
 
06:43:19.350 --> 06:43:19.360 align:start position:0%
breeds doing this that are
 
06:43:22.350 --> 06:43:22.360 align:start position:0%
supposedly you know having an
 
06:43:25.030 --> 06:43:25.040 align:start position:0%
issue they're not there it's not there
 
06:43:28.510 --> 06:43:28.520 align:start position:0%
with these guys so I just you know thank
 
06:43:30.750 --> 06:43:30.760 align:start position:0%
you any
 
06:43:33.350 --> 06:43:33.360 align:start position:0%
questions oh representative kto thank
 
06:43:36.430 --> 06:43:36.440 align:start position:0%
you madam chair would you believe that
 
06:43:36.440 --> 06:43:37.628 align:start position:0%
you madam chair would you believe that
my

06:43:37.628 --> 06:43:37.638 align:start position:0%
my
 
06:43:41.430 --> 06:43:41.440 align:start position:0%
boxer uh kept up with my boy's dirt
 
06:43:43.788 --> 06:43:43.798 align:start position:0%
bikes actually kind of went ahead of
 
06:43:46.150 --> 06:43:46.160 align:start position:0%
them I would I would believe it because
 
06:43:49.388 --> 06:43:49.398 align:start position:0%
with my dose I we used to do snowball
 
06:43:51.310 --> 06:43:51.320 align:start position:0%
you know snowmobile and the dog would be
 
06:43:53.350 --> 06:43:53.360 align:start position:0%
right there running right along with us
 
06:43:56.830 --> 06:43:56.840 align:start position:0%
and uh the other the other thing is um
 
06:44:00.270 --> 06:44:00.280 align:start position:0%
of course I lost my train of thought
 
06:44:03.788 --> 06:44:03.798 align:start position:0%
uh all right I forgot it okay it's kind
 
06:44:05.350 --> 06:44:05.360 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
06:44:08.070 --> 06:44:08.080 align:start position:0%
for seeing none thank you very much uh
 
06:44:22.548 --> 06:44:22.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:22.558 --> 06:44:28.388 align:start position:0%
 
Rizzo

06:44:28.388 --> 06:44:28.398 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:31.788 --> 06:44:31.798 align:start position:0%
hi so my name is Kathy Rizzo I'm here um
 
06:44:33.468 --> 06:44:33.478 align:start position:0%
on behalf of myself I'm a breeder of
 
06:44:36.030 --> 06:44:36.040 align:start position:0%
pugs as well as the Pug dog Club of
 
06:44:39.230 --> 06:44:39.240 align:start position:0%
America which is um operates under the
 
06:44:41.070 --> 06:44:41.080 align:start position:0%
umbrella of the American kenel Club so
 
06:44:44.230 --> 06:44:44.240 align:start position:0%
that is the parent club that Stacy was
 
06:44:44.240 --> 06:44:45.190 align:start position:0%
that is the parent club that Stacy was
talking

06:44:45.190 --> 06:44:45.200 align:start position:0%
talking
 
06:44:49.590 --> 06:44:49.600 align:start position:0%
about there was um so I live in we New
 
06:44:51.990 --> 06:44:52.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I've been dedicated to raising
 
06:44:54.310 --> 06:44:54.320 align:start position:0%
showing and exhibiting both pugs and
 
06:44:57.190 --> 06:44:57.200 align:start position:0%
French Bulldogs for almost two
 
06:44:59.510 --> 06:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
decades I would like you to know I do
 
06:45:03.190 --> 06:45:03.200 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill um it just unfairly
 
06:45:05.230 --> 06:45:05.240 align:start position:0%
penalizes responsible breeders like
 
06:45:07.628 --> 06:45:07.638 align:start position:0%
myself who work tirelessly to maintain
 
06:45:08.868 --> 06:45:08.878 align:start position:0%
the breed
 
06:45:11.750 --> 06:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
Integrity um this bill will not only
 
06:45:14.990 --> 06:45:15.000 align:start position:0%
deter dog acquisition but it will it
 
06:45:20.070 --> 06:45:20.080 align:start position:0%
will drive to um have buyers go outside
 
06:45:24.708 --> 06:45:24.718 align:start position:0%
of uh New Hampshire so I just wanted to
 
06:45:28.910 --> 06:45:28.920 align:start position:0%
clarify one point that was made earlier
 
06:45:32.150 --> 06:45:32.160 align:start position:0%
on the Pug dog Club of America saying
 
06:45:34.830 --> 06:45:34.840 align:start position:0%
that they have directly in the standard
 
06:45:37.990 --> 06:45:38.000 align:start position:0%
the very flat face um in our standard
 
06:45:41.548 --> 06:45:41.558 align:start position:0%
for the pdca it does say that the nose
 
06:45:44.350 --> 06:45:44.360 align:start position:0%
is undesirable that the wrinkle comes
 
06:45:46.830 --> 06:45:46.840 align:start position:0%
over and covers a significant portion of
 
06:45:49.310 --> 06:45:49.320 align:start position:0%
the nose and it negatively affects the
 
06:45:51.750 --> 06:45:51.760 align:start position:0%
Pug's ability to breathe comfortably so
 
06:45:53.948 --> 06:45:53.958 align:start position:0%
I'd like that to be in there
 
06:45:56.310 --> 06:45:56.320 align:start position:0%
um and that it is undesirable that the
 
06:45:59.868 --> 06:45:59.878 align:start position:0%
eyes are bulging and East West so when
 
06:46:03.788 --> 06:46:03.798 align:start position:0%
the eyes come out they go to the side so
 
06:46:07.628 --> 06:46:07.638 align:start position:0%
I just wanted that for the record um I'd
 
06:46:10.110 --> 06:46:10.120 align:start position:0%
like to share a few critical points
 
06:46:12.150 --> 06:46:12.160 align:start position:0%
that's made by one of our Patriot pug
 
06:46:15.468 --> 06:46:15.478 align:start position:0%
dog club members NE Nelson Lao he is a
 
06:46:18.670 --> 06:46:18.680 align:start position:0%
PhD biologist and professor of genetics
 
06:46:21.628 --> 06:46:21.638 align:start position:0%
and biochemistry at Boston University he
 
06:46:24.548 --> 06:46:24.558 align:start position:0%
argues that brasali is not a birth
 
06:46:28.510 --> 06:46:28.520 align:start position:0%
defect the skin color uh brasali is like
 
06:46:30.948 --> 06:46:30.958 align:start position:0%
skin color or height in humans it is
 
06:46:32.948 --> 06:46:32.958 align:start position:0%
naturally occurring stable trait in
 
06:46:36.590 --> 06:46:36.600 align:start position:0%
animals it has been intentionally bred
 
06:46:39.628 --> 06:46:39.638 align:start position:0%
into various dogs and cats through
 
06:46:41.910 --> 06:46:41.920 align:start position:0%
careful breeding programs over centuries
 
06:46:44.628 --> 06:46:44.638 align:start position:0%
of domestication many dog breeders
 
06:46:47.670 --> 06:46:47.680 align:start position:0%
exhibiting bre are healthy and Thrive
 
06:46:50.510 --> 06:46:50.520 align:start position:0%
with that are raised in suitable
 
06:46:53.590 --> 06:46:53.600 align:start position:0%
environments often as toys toy breed
 
06:46:55.750 --> 06:46:55.760 align:start position:0%
that are meant for companionship rather
 
06:46:58.750 --> 06:46:58.760 align:start position:0%
than working or sporting the presence of
 
06:47:01.948 --> 06:47:01.958 align:start position:0%
the short nose of these breeds does not
 
06:47:03.628 --> 06:47:03.638 align:start position:0%
adequate to a
 
06:47:06.110 --> 06:47:06.120 align:start position:0%
defect um responsible breeders
 
06:47:08.628 --> 06:47:08.638 align:start position:0%
prioritize animal welfare and breed
 
06:47:10.990 --> 06:47:11.000 align:start position:0%
preservation criminalizing breeding
 
06:47:13.708 --> 06:47:13.718 align:start position:0%
regardless of practices is ignores this
 
06:47:15.910 --> 06:47:15.920 align:start position:0%
commitment protecting responsible
 
06:47:19.830 --> 06:47:19.840 align:start position:0%
breeding is vital HB 112's blanket
 
06:47:22.070 --> 06:47:22.080 align:start position:0%
approach overlooks breeding nuances and
 
06:47:24.150 --> 06:47:24.160 align:start position:0%
natures and contradict our state
 
06:47:29.510 --> 06:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
principal thank you okay thank you any
 
06:47:32.788 --> 06:47:32.798 align:start position:0%
questions no okay um I do have a
 
06:47:36.708 --> 06:47:36.718 align:start position:0%
question are do you know anybody in your
 
06:47:40.150 --> 06:47:40.160 align:start position:0%
pug Community whose pug dog has had uh
 
06:47:43.150 --> 06:47:43.160 align:start position:0%
issues with breathing and boas has
 
06:47:44.830 --> 06:47:44.840 align:start position:0%
needed boas
 
06:47:51.270 --> 06:47:51.280 align:start position:0%
surgery no uh no um Boaz as far as
 
06:47:54.190 --> 06:47:54.200 align:start position:0%
um the health testing is fairly new to
 
06:47:58.110 --> 06:47:58.120 align:start position:0%
the US if if I'm correct so the Pug dog
 
06:48:00.510 --> 06:48:00.520 align:start position:0%
Club of America is advocating for
 
06:48:03.948 --> 06:48:03.958 align:start position:0%
breeders to um get that
 
06:48:08.910 --> 06:48:08.920 align:start position:0%
done okay thank you thank you any other
 
06:48:22.190 --> 06:48:22.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:22.200 --> 06:48:24.750 align:start position:0%

06:48:24.750 --> 06:48:24.760 align:start position:0%
Holmes
 
06:48:28.510 --> 06:48:28.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:41.548 --> 06:48:41.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:44.150 --> 06:48:44.160 align:start position:0%
am well some of what I cover in my
 
06:48:47.150 --> 06:48:47.160 align:start position:0%
testimony um has already been covered by
 
06:48:49.788 --> 06:48:49.798 align:start position:0%
people um one of the things that was not
 
06:48:53.990 --> 06:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
was the um Airway syndrome inherited
 
06:48:56.190 --> 06:48:56.200 align:start position:0%
problem in Norwich teras which are not a
 
06:48:58.788 --> 06:48:58.798 align:start position:0%
brachy calic breed and yet still have a
 
06:49:01.388 --> 06:49:01.398 align:start position:0%
known inherited Airway problem which the
 
06:49:04.190 --> 06:49:04.200 align:start position:0%
Breeders are working to eradicate so
 
06:49:06.190 --> 06:49:06.200 align:start position:0%
saying it's all brachy spelic breeds
 
06:49:08.670 --> 06:49:08.680 align:start position:0%
that have a problem like this is
 
06:49:11.590 --> 06:49:11.600 align:start position:0%
incorrect um as several people stated
 
06:49:16.030 --> 06:49:16.040 align:start position:0%
braisy is not a condition it's a uh
 
06:49:18.030 --> 06:49:18.040 align:start position:0%
description of a
 
06:49:20.430 --> 06:49:20.440 align:start position:0%
skull in terms of this
 
06:49:22.708 --> 06:49:22.718 align:start position:0%
bill one of the things I want to know is
 
06:49:25.990 --> 06:49:26.000 align:start position:0%
who can afford to prove time after time
 
06:49:29.910 --> 06:49:29.920 align:start position:0%
that they had no intent of breeding dogs
 
06:49:31.510 --> 06:49:31.520 align:start position:0%
that had a
 
06:49:33.708 --> 06:49:33.718 align:start position:0%
problem um particularly when the dogs
 
06:49:35.548 --> 06:49:35.558 align:start position:0%
have been seized your dogs have been
 
06:49:37.350 --> 06:49:37.360 align:start position:0%
seized and you have to pay for all their
 
06:49:38.468 --> 06:49:38.478 align:start position:0%
Board and
 
06:49:41.150 --> 06:49:41.160 align:start position:0%
Care so this bill is going to cause
 
06:49:42.628 --> 06:49:42.638 align:start position:0%
hardship on all
 
06:49:45.388 --> 06:49:45.398 align:start position:0%
breeders anybody can be accused anybody
 
06:49:46.868 --> 06:49:46.878 align:start position:0%
can have their dogs
 
06:49:49.150 --> 06:49:49.160 align:start position:0%
taken I believe that something that
 
06:49:51.708 --> 06:49:51.718 align:start position:0%
could positively be done to help with
 
06:49:54.708 --> 06:49:54.718 align:start position:0%
things like this is enforcement of the
 
06:49:57.990 --> 06:49:58.000 align:start position:0%
health certificate law right now I would
 
06:50:00.590 --> 06:50:00.600 align:start position:0%
say 95% of the people who sell dogs cats
 
06:50:03.670 --> 06:50:03.680 align:start position:0%
kittens anything else have no health
 
06:50:06.150 --> 06:50:06.160 align:start position:0%
certificate that goes with them at
 
06:50:10.510 --> 06:50:10.520 align:start position:0%
all um something else
 
06:50:14.150 --> 06:50:14.160 align:start position:0%
um that I did put in my in my notes is I
 
06:50:16.670 --> 06:50:16.680 align:start position:0%
really wish breeders were as omniscient
 
06:50:19.430 --> 06:50:19.440 align:start position:0%
as this bill intends us to be because
 
06:50:21.468 --> 06:50:21.478 align:start position:0%
what this bill intends is that a breeder
 
06:50:23.190 --> 06:50:23.200 align:start position:0%
is going to know at the time of
 
06:50:25.230 --> 06:50:25.240 align:start position:0%
conception how the puppies are going to
 
06:50:28.788 --> 06:50:28.798 align:start position:0%
turn out and sorry not going to happen I
 
06:50:31.430 --> 06:50:31.440 align:start position:0%
don't know where that 90% number of 90%
 
06:50:33.350 --> 06:50:33.360 align:start position:0%
of the the bracket calic dogs are
 
06:50:36.430 --> 06:50:36.440 align:start position:0%
affected came from but I'll tell you
 
06:50:38.468 --> 06:50:38.478 align:start position:0%
you'll see a picture of my breed a dog
 
06:50:40.510 --> 06:50:40.520 align:start position:0%
in this I don't usually talk about it I
 
06:50:43.590 --> 06:50:43.600 align:start position:0%
raised Apen pinches for over 20 years I
 
06:50:45.548 --> 06:50:45.558 align:start position:0%
was the breed National breed Club
 
06:50:47.430 --> 06:50:47.440 align:start position:0%
president I was also the national
 
06:50:50.468 --> 06:50:50.478 align:start position:0%
coordinator for breed rescue and I was
 
06:50:52.510 --> 06:50:52.520 align:start position:0%
in contact with people nationally and
 
06:50:55.468 --> 06:50:55.478 align:start position:0%
internation Al so I can tell you I never
 
06:50:57.750 --> 06:50:57.760 align:start position:0%
heard once of an airway problem with
 
06:50:59.750 --> 06:50:59.760 align:start position:0%
this breed and it's a brachy pallic
 
06:51:03.310 --> 06:51:03.320 align:start position:0%
breed so I kind of I'm kind of resenting
 
06:51:06.110 --> 06:51:06.120 align:start position:0%
being lumped in with the other breeds um
 
06:51:08.230 --> 06:51:08.240 align:start position:0%
but but the way this bill is written it
 
06:51:10.708 --> 06:51:10.718 align:start position:0%
works the other thing I find very scary
 
06:51:14.628 --> 06:51:14.638 align:start position:0%
is those two little words such as that
 
06:51:16.628 --> 06:51:16.638 align:start position:0%
leaves every breeder wide open and I
 
06:51:19.190 --> 06:51:19.200 align:start position:0%
have to ask the chair if it's safe can I
 
06:51:21.548 --> 06:51:21.558 align:start position:0%
read a quote from representative Reed
 
06:51:23.750 --> 06:51:23.760 align:start position:0%
that was on um the the New Hampshire
 
06:51:26.190 --> 06:51:26.200 align:start position:0%
animal rights League
 
06:51:28.990 --> 06:51:29.000 align:start position:0%
website sure I don't okay I I don't want
 
06:51:31.110 --> 06:51:31.120 align:start position:0%
to offend anybody but it's it's really
 
06:51:32.910 --> 06:51:32.920 align:start position:0%
confus me between what I'm hearing and
 
06:51:35.948 --> 06:51:35.958 align:start position:0%
what what I read online on that website
 
06:51:38.510 --> 06:51:38.520 align:start position:0%
it said representative Ellen Reed wants
 
06:51:41.910 --> 06:51:41.920 align:start position:0%
to end the breeding of brachy calic
 
06:51:44.110 --> 06:51:44.120 align:start position:0%
flat-faced dogs and cats who struggle to
 
06:51:45.708 --> 06:51:45.718 align:start position:0%
breathe and have many other health
 
06:51:48.150 --> 06:51:48.160 align:start position:0%
problems and then further down the page
 
06:51:50.548 --> 06:51:50.558 align:start position:0%
it says thanks to representative Ellen
 
06:51:52.310 --> 06:51:52.320 align:start position:0%
Reed New Hampshire will be the first in
 
06:51:54.830 --> 06:51:54.840 align:start position:0%
the nation to consider legislation that
 
06:51:56.788 --> 06:51:56.798 align:start position:0%
would ban the breeding and sale of
 
06:52:00.430 --> 06:52:00.440 align:start position:0%
brachet calic dogs and cats okay so I
 
06:52:02.030 --> 06:52:02.040 align:start position:0%
add a little problem I'm going to throw
 
06:52:04.030 --> 06:52:04.040 align:start position:0%
one more thing at you before I go away
 
06:52:05.590 --> 06:52:05.600 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I
 
06:52:09.190 --> 06:52:09.200 align:start position:0%
just who is being cruel the breeders who
 
06:52:11.708 --> 06:52:11.718 align:start position:0%
produce the pups or the owners who put
 
06:52:14.350 --> 06:52:14.360 align:start position:0%
the dogs through surgery after surgery
 
06:52:15.868 --> 06:52:15.878 align:start position:0%
and keep them in conditions and
 
06:52:18.510 --> 06:52:18.520 align:start position:0%
overweight that causes the problem who's
 
06:52:21.388 --> 06:52:21.398 align:start position:0%
the cruel person here um I don't think
 
06:52:23.350 --> 06:52:23.360 align:start position:0%
it's the Breeders I am prej just about
 
06:52:26.070 --> 06:52:26.080 align:start position:0%
that but um I'll be happy to answer any
 
06:52:28.590 --> 06:52:28.600 align:start position:0%
questions I I had a lot more to go but
 
06:52:30.628 --> 06:52:30.638 align:start position:0%
any question it's been a really long
 
06:52:34.270 --> 06:52:34.280 align:start position:0%
day quick one so the um the quote that
 
06:52:36.548 --> 06:52:36.558 align:start position:0%
you read was not her quote it was what
 
06:52:38.708 --> 06:52:38.718 align:start position:0%
they said in regards to her correct
 
06:52:39.990 --> 06:52:40.000 align:start position:0%
quotes around it and it said
 
06:52:42.150 --> 06:52:42.160 align:start position:0%
representative Ellen Reed
 
06:52:45.628 --> 06:52:45.638 align:start position:0%
said so I'm presuming that that was what
 
06:52:47.548 --> 06:52:47.558 align:start position:0%
now do I know if they quoted her
 
06:52:50.910 --> 06:52:50.920 align:start position:0%
correctly hey you know yeah that I that
 
06:52:52.350 --> 06:52:52.360 align:start position:0%
I that I don't know I just found it very
 
06:52:54.468 --> 06:52:54.478 align:start position:0%
confused listening testimony here oh
 
06:52:57.388 --> 06:52:57.398 align:start position:0%
we're not ending it to a website saying
 
06:52:58.430 --> 06:52:58.440 align:start position:0%
here's the quotes from this
 
06:53:00.070 --> 06:53:00.080 align:start position:0%
representative saying that we will end
 
06:53:03.708 --> 06:53:03.718 align:start position:0%
it I understand thank you thank you okay
 
06:53:05.230 --> 06:53:05.240 align:start position:0%
no other questions from the committee
 
06:53:21.750 --> 06:53:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:21.760 --> 06:53:29.590 align:start position:0%
 
sir

06:53:29.590 --> 06:53:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:31.230 --> 06:53:31.240 align:start position:0%
good afternoon if I could just take one
 
06:53:32.830 --> 06:53:32.840 align:start position:0%
moment before I start my time on the
 
06:53:35.510 --> 06:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
testimony I did just want to bring up uh
 
06:53:37.070 --> 06:53:37.080 align:start position:0%
even though we don't have the current
 
06:53:39.388 --> 06:53:39.398 align:start position:0%
bill sponsor here I do not appreciate
 
06:53:41.150 --> 06:53:41.160 align:start position:0%
the fact after we had a
 
06:53:43.990 --> 06:53:44.000 align:start position:0%
conversation uh regarding being polite
 
06:53:45.628 --> 06:53:45.638 align:start position:0%
to one another that she felt it
 
06:53:47.150 --> 06:53:47.160 align:start position:0%
necessary to come over and take photos
 
06:53:49.510 --> 06:53:49.520 align:start position:0%
of my service dog not only is that
 
06:53:51.910 --> 06:53:51.920 align:start position:0%
against the Ada that is breaking of my
 
06:53:54.230 --> 06:53:54.240 align:start position:0%
own privacy so if something could be
 
06:53:55.990 --> 06:53:56.000 align:start position:0%
said that would be fabulous because that
 
06:53:58.030 --> 06:53:58.040 align:start position:0%
was very inappropriate thank you okay
 
06:54:01.110 --> 06:54:01.120 align:start position:0%
thank you uh so my name is Megan bser I
 
06:54:03.310 --> 06:54:03.320 align:start position:0%
am a proud owner exhibitor and fancier
 
06:54:05.750 --> 06:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
of the English toy spaniel breed I am
 
06:54:07.948 --> 06:54:07.958 align:start position:0%
grateful that at this time uh they have
 
06:54:09.788 --> 06:54:09.798 align:start position:0%
not been mentioned at all in this band
 
06:54:12.708 --> 06:54:12.718 align:start position:0%
but the band would certainly uh affect
 
06:54:15.510 --> 06:54:15.520 align:start position:0%
myself and the English toy fanciers so I
 
06:54:18.590 --> 06:54:18.600 align:start position:0%
am here to discuss um that we are in
 
06:54:21.750 --> 06:54:21.760 align:start position:0%
opposition of HB 11102 being myself and
 
06:54:23.388 --> 06:54:23.398 align:start position:0%
English toy spaniel Club of
 
06:54:25.628 --> 06:54:25.638 align:start position:0%
America as a rare breed with Rich
 
06:54:27.270 --> 06:54:27.280 align:start position:0%
history leading back to the Victorian
 
06:54:29.910 --> 06:54:29.920 align:start position:0%
era in King Charles II depictions of
 
06:54:32.070 --> 06:54:32.080 align:start position:0%
this breed remain nearly untouched since
 
06:54:34.830 --> 06:54:34.840 align:start position:0%
it was originally documented the English
 
06:54:37.230 --> 06:54:37.240 align:start position:0%
toy spaniel Club of America standard was
 
06:54:39.310 --> 06:54:39.320 align:start position:0%
approved by the AKC in
 
06:54:42.190 --> 06:54:42.200 align:start position:0%
1886 and the last change was made 35
 
06:54:45.270 --> 06:54:45.280 align:start position:0%
years ago these changes were made to
 
06:54:47.868 --> 06:54:47.878 align:start position:0%
allow a broader gene pool to ensure that
 
06:54:51.590 --> 06:54:51.600 align:start position:0%
we are providing a healthier dog in our
 
06:54:51.600 --> 06:54:53.670 align:start position:0%
we are providing a healthier dog in our
production

06:54:53.670 --> 06:54:53.680 align:start position:0%
production
 
06:54:56.628 --> 06:54:56.638 align:start position:0%
um research not bias has shown that
 
06:54:58.070 --> 06:54:58.080 align:start position:0%
length of snout and muzzle does not
 
06:54:59.910 --> 06:54:59.920 align:start position:0%
equate to the health of an animal
 
06:55:02.230 --> 06:55:02.240 align:start position:0%
preservation breeders work diligently to
 
06:55:03.670 --> 06:55:03.680 align:start position:0%
guarantee the Health and Longevity of
 
06:55:05.708 --> 06:55:05.718 align:start position:0%
our pets and the science behind that
 
06:55:08.270 --> 06:55:08.280 align:start position:0%
hard work is shown I can say that my
 
06:55:11.350 --> 06:55:11.360 align:start position:0%
dogs personally I have been part of the
 
06:55:14.230 --> 06:55:14.240 align:start position:0%
uh boas studies here in the US and all
 
06:55:16.270 --> 06:55:16.280 align:start position:0%
of my dogs have been graded as a zero
 
06:55:19.230 --> 06:55:19.240 align:start position:0%
with no concerns um I've also further
 
06:55:21.548 --> 06:55:21.558 align:start position:0%
been helping Dr rosansky at tus
 
06:55:23.270 --> 06:55:23.280 align:start position:0%
University to compile research to
 
06:55:25.948 --> 06:55:25.958 align:start position:0%
further benefit our dogs another
 
06:55:27.388 --> 06:55:27.398 align:start position:0%
function with the English toy spaniel
 
06:55:29.070 --> 06:55:29.080 align:start position:0%
Club of America is we have had an
 
06:55:32.030 --> 06:55:32.040 align:start position:0%
increase in our performance events by
 
06:55:34.948 --> 06:55:34.958 align:start position:0%
225% um we've had 15 English toy
 
06:55:37.110 --> 06:55:37.120 align:start position:0%
spaniels that were owned by club members
 
06:55:39.830 --> 06:55:39.840 align:start position:0%
achiev 58 performance titles which have
 
06:55:43.150 --> 06:55:43.160 align:start position:0%
included therapy work agility obedience
 
06:55:45.948 --> 06:55:45.958 align:start position:0%
rally confirmation scent Work Fit dog
 
06:55:48.270 --> 06:55:48.280 align:start position:0%
and among many others this alone is
 
06:55:49.910 --> 06:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
proof that our breed is not deformed and
 
06:55:51.750 --> 06:55:51.760 align:start position:0%
suffering and in fact is thriving in the
 
06:55:54.590 --> 06:55:54.600 align:start position:0%
same Sports as non- braie dogs competing
 
06:55:56.388 --> 06:55:56.398 align:start position:0%
keep in mind that we do have a very rare
 
06:55:58.708 --> 06:55:58.718 align:start position:0%
breed with very low numbers so the fact
 
06:56:01.230 --> 06:56:01.240 align:start position:0%
that it does see only as 58 dogs is
 
06:56:04.190 --> 06:56:04.200 align:start position:0%
actually a very high amount in our
 
06:56:07.788 --> 06:56:07.798 align:start position:0%
breed as my loyal service dog Cedric uh
 
06:56:09.670 --> 06:56:09.680 align:start position:0%
can show the court he is anything but
 
06:56:12.388 --> 06:56:12.398 align:start position:0%
deformed he is only an asset to me I'm
 
06:56:14.350 --> 06:56:14.360 align:start position:0%
sorry he's not only an asset to me but
 
06:56:15.830 --> 06:56:15.840 align:start position:0%
also an asset to the breed in of pure
 
06:56:18.468 --> 06:56:18.478 align:start position:0%
bread dogs a deformed and Ill dog would
 
06:56:20.310 --> 06:56:20.320 align:start position:0%
not be able to be successful in so many
 
06:56:22.150 --> 06:56:22.160 align:start position:0%

no oh okay
okay

06:56:55.430 --> 06:56:55.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:57:09.868 --> 06:57:09.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:14.590 --> 06:57:14.600 align:start position:0%
Proctor hi hi um I appreciate all that
 
06:57:17.430 --> 06:57:17.440 align:start position:0%
you do much more now after sitting here
 
06:57:21.230 --> 06:57:21.240 align:start position:0%
for so long um I'm Sarah Proctor I am a
 
06:57:23.708 --> 06:57:23.718 align:start position:0%
veterinarian I've been a vet for a long
 
06:57:26.750 --> 06:57:26.760 align:start position:0%
time I submitted an email that I'm not
 
06:57:28.708 --> 06:57:28.718 align:start position:0%
going to basically talk at all about
 
06:57:30.590 --> 06:57:30.600 align:start position:0%
because everybody else has said all of
 
06:57:35.948 --> 06:57:35.958 align:start position:0%
it except for one thing um I um I work
 
06:57:37.830 --> 06:57:37.840 align:start position:0%
at the Pope Memorial of me society and
 
06:57:42.830 --> 06:57:42.840 align:start position:0%
Dover and um I I do oppose this bill for
 
06:57:45.030 --> 06:57:45.040 align:start position:0%
a lot of the reasons that people other
 
06:57:47.548 --> 06:57:47.558 align:start position:0%
people have said
 
06:57:50.350 --> 06:57:50.360 align:start position:0%
um but the the one thing that hasn't
 
06:57:53.030 --> 06:57:53.040 align:start position:0%
been said relates to how
 
06:57:55.468 --> 06:57:55.478 align:start position:0%
I imagine this might affect animal
 
06:57:58.628 --> 06:57:58.638 align:start position:0%
shelters um the language in the bill
 
06:58:00.430 --> 06:58:00.440 align:start position:0%
suggests that
 
06:58:03.628 --> 06:58:03.638 align:start position:0%
selling and oh no it says that selling
 
06:58:05.510 --> 06:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
an animal with the blah blah blah blah
 
06:58:08.230 --> 06:58:08.240 align:start position:0%
blah is considered
 
06:58:11.110 --> 06:58:11.120 align:start position:0%
cruelty um and animal shelters we like
 
06:58:12.910 --> 06:58:12.920 align:start position:0%
to say that we're adopting the animals
 
06:58:15.510 --> 06:58:15.520 align:start position:0%
but we are transferring ownership for
 
06:58:18.830 --> 06:58:18.840 align:start position:0%
money um so I think that would make us
 
06:58:22.150 --> 06:58:22.160 align:start position:0%
fall under this Rule and I I'm sure
 
06:58:25.590 --> 06:58:25.600 align:start position:0%
that's not the intention of it um I
 
06:58:28.948 --> 06:58:28.958 align:start position:0%
think this is a a a bad way to get at a
 
06:58:31.948 --> 06:58:31.958 align:start position:0%
problem that I think is real
 
06:58:34.230 --> 06:58:34.240 align:start position:0%
um and that's really the only thing that
 
06:58:36.430 --> 06:58:36.440 align:start position:0%
I haven't heard said all afternoon is
 
06:58:39.270 --> 06:58:39.280 align:start position:0%
that you might have animal shelters
 
06:58:42.150 --> 06:58:42.160 align:start position:0%
unable to place these types of dogs and
 
06:58:45.230 --> 06:58:45.240 align:start position:0%
cats and rabbits um because of the way
 
06:58:47.030 --> 06:58:47.040 align:start position:0%
the language is written and even if they
 
06:58:50.670 --> 06:58:50.680 align:start position:0%
are excluded somehow we we have to give
 
06:58:53.510 --> 06:58:53.520 align:start position:0%
them away for free I I see this being
 
06:58:55.070 --> 06:58:55.080 align:start position:0%
something that shelters might start to
 
06:58:58.310 --> 06:58:58.320 align:start position:0%
shy away from taking the animals in
 
06:58:59.468 --> 06:58:59.478 align:start position:0%
because they don't want to get in
 
06:59:01.270 --> 06:59:01.280 align:start position:0%
trouble they don't know what to do they
 
06:59:03.190 --> 06:59:03.200 align:start position:0%
don't know how to deal with it and so we
 
06:59:04.910 --> 06:59:04.920 align:start position:0%
might end up putting the burden back
 
06:59:08.030 --> 06:59:08.040 align:start position:0%
onto the the person who just died and
 
06:59:10.270 --> 06:59:10.280 align:start position:0%
well I guess they're dead they're no
 
06:59:12.708 --> 06:59:12.718 align:start position:0%
burden but the family that has an animal
 
06:59:15.590 --> 06:59:15.600 align:start position:0%
that they have to rehome that um now can
 
06:59:19.868 --> 06:59:19.878 align:start position:0%
can't go to a typical animal shelter um
 
06:59:21.708 --> 06:59:21.718 align:start position:0%
lots of other thoughts but I'll leave it
 
06:59:24.510 --> 06:59:24.520 align:start position:0%
there representative coma thank you
 
06:59:26.910 --> 06:59:26.920 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you for taking my
 
06:59:30.750 --> 06:59:30.760 align:start position:0%
question at this late hour um working at
 
06:59:31.948 --> 06:59:31.958 align:start position:0%
Pope Memorial and bringing up the
 
06:59:34.548 --> 06:59:34.558 align:start position:0%
shelter issue um brings to mind a
 
06:59:38.230 --> 06:59:38.240 align:start position:0%
question that I've had do you think that
 
06:59:40.750 --> 06:59:40.760 align:start position:0%
this could cause a um a lot of these
 
06:59:43.150 --> 06:59:43.160 align:start position:0%
animals to be euthanized um because
 
06:59:45.230 --> 06:59:45.240 align:start position:0%
there may be no place for them to
 
06:59:48.830 --> 06:59:48.840 align:start position:0%
go I think that would be an extreme
 
06:59:51.750 --> 06:59:51.760 align:start position:0%
solution but it's a fear that I have it
 
06:59:54.190 --> 06:59:54.200 align:start position:0%
would never be a shelter's first
 
06:59:54.200 --> 06:59:57.388 align:start position:0%
would never be a shelter's first
choice

06:59:57.388 --> 06:59:57.398 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:00.708 --> 07:00:00.718 align:start position:0%
um but it's it's something I'm afraid
 
07:00:03.788 --> 07:00:03.798 align:start position:0%
Could Happen um I'm more worried that
 
07:00:07.070 --> 07:00:07.080 align:start position:0%
the animals just will be turned away um
 
07:00:08.788 --> 07:00:08.798 align:start position:0%
and in some cases maybe they do get
 
07:00:08.798 --> 07:00:10.468 align:start position:0%
and in some cases maybe they do get
euthanized

07:00:10.468 --> 07:00:10.478 align:start position:0%
euthanized
 
07:00:14.910 --> 07:00:14.920 align:start position:0%
because especially if um whoever decides
 
07:00:18.388 --> 07:00:18.398 align:start position:0%
this decided that transferring ownership
 
07:00:20.788 --> 07:00:20.798 align:start position:0%
equals selling even if there's no money
 
07:00:24.350 --> 07:00:24.360 align:start position:0%
involved that that that I don't know um
 
07:00:26.788 --> 07:00:26.798 align:start position:0%
but if we are unable to change the
 
07:00:31.270 --> 07:00:31.280 align:start position:0%
ownership of the animal um even for free
 
07:00:33.590 --> 07:00:33.600 align:start position:0%
then there would be nowhere for them to
 
07:00:35.990 --> 07:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
go we couldn't send them
 
07:00:40.510 --> 07:00:40.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:43.868 --> 07:00:43.878 align:start position:0%
scary any other questions from the
 
07:00:47.708 --> 07:00:47.718 align:start position:0%
committee no um I I have a question a
 
07:00:51.030 --> 07:00:51.040 align:start position:0%
couple of questions actually
 
07:00:51.040 --> 07:00:54.230 align:start position:0%
couple of questions actually
um

07:00:54.230 --> 07:00:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:56.910 --> 07:00:56.920 align:start position:0%
in in this bill it says cells an animal
 
07:00:59.990 --> 07:01:00.000 align:start position:0%
that has a birth deformity that causes
 
07:01:00.000 --> 07:01:01.548 align:start position:0%
that has a birth deformity that causes
suffering

07:01:01.548 --> 07:01:01.558 align:start position:0%
suffering
 
07:01:05.430 --> 07:01:05.440 align:start position:0%
um I mean such as there's such as braisy
 
07:01:07.310 --> 07:01:07.320 align:start position:0%
or the intentional breeding with the
 
07:01:09.830 --> 07:01:09.840 align:start position:0%
intent to sell two individual animals
 
07:01:12.430 --> 07:01:12.440 align:start position:0%
with the same birth deformity that
 
07:01:16.388 --> 07:01:16.398 align:start position:0%
 
07:01:21.270 --> 07:01:21.280 align:start position:0%
um how how do in your matter of practice
 
07:01:24.110 --> 07:01:24.120 align:start position:0%
do you do do you see many birth
 
07:01:28.750 --> 07:01:28.760 align:start position:0%
deformities in dogs or cats I guess it
 
07:01:30.510 --> 07:01:30.520 align:start position:0%
depends on who's defining birth
 
07:01:32.388 --> 07:01:32.398 align:start position:0%
deformity and we've had lots of
 
07:01:36.670 --> 07:01:36.680 align:start position:0%
discussion about um I see lots of
 
07:01:40.350 --> 07:01:40.360 align:start position:0%
braches phalic dogs and cats that have
 
07:01:43.030 --> 07:01:43.040 align:start position:0%
respiratory and muscular skeletal
 
07:01:46.670 --> 07:01:46.680 align:start position:0%
problems um I think the other problem I
 
07:01:49.628 --> 07:01:49.638 align:start position:0%
have with Bill is that there's no
 
07:01:52.510 --> 07:01:52.520 align:start position:0%
clarity about when those
 
07:01:54.830 --> 07:01:54.840 align:start position:0%
anatomic traits become
 
07:01:58.110 --> 07:01:58.120 align:start position:0%
suffering um you you have the extremes
 
07:02:00.350 --> 07:02:00.360 align:start position:0%
and at some point yes suffering happens
 
07:02:02.110 --> 07:02:02.120 align:start position:0%
but who's
 
07:02:04.948 --> 07:02:04.958 align:start position:0%
deciding when it becomes suffering and
 
07:02:10.468 --> 07:02:10.478 align:start position:0%
when it's fine um so I yeah I I think a
 
07:02:12.628 --> 07:02:12.638 align:start position:0%
lot of people don't recognize the
 
07:02:17.750 --> 07:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
suffering that the animals have um I I
 
07:02:21.190 --> 07:02:21.200 align:start position:0%
personally think we should be res doing
 
07:02:23.670 --> 07:02:23.680 align:start position:0%
something to to make dogs have longer
 
07:02:26.468 --> 07:02:26.478 align:start position:0%
noses than the extremes that a lot of
 
07:02:28.948 --> 07:02:28.958 align:start position:0%
them do um but there's a lot of other
 
07:02:31.350 --> 07:02:31.360 align:start position:0%
medical problems that are related to all
 
07:02:34.468 --> 07:02:34.478 align:start position:0%
the the the breeding interbreeding that
 
07:02:37.830 --> 07:02:37.840 align:start position:0%
we do to create pure Brits
 
07:02:40.548 --> 07:02:40.558 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if legislation is the
 
07:02:43.030 --> 07:02:43.040 align:start position:0%
way to fix it but I I think there is
 
07:02:43.040 --> 07:02:44.708 align:start position:0%
way to fix it but I I think there is
suffering

07:02:44.708 --> 07:02:44.718 align:start position:0%
suffering
 
07:02:47.670 --> 07:02:47.680 align:start position:0%
um it might not be severe all the time
 
07:02:49.990 --> 07:02:50.000 align:start position:0%
but there's a lot of dogs that are very
 
07:02:51.990 --> 07:02:52.000 align:start position:0%
happy when I put a tube into their
 
07:02:54.030 --> 07:02:54.040 align:start position:0%
throat to clean their teeth that's the
 
07:02:55.788 --> 07:02:55.798 align:start position:0%
most oxygen their brain has had in their
 
07:02:57.590 --> 07:02:57.600 align:start position:0%
whole life because I've given them an
 
07:02:57.600 --> 07:02:58.510 align:start position:0%
whole life because I've given them an
actual

07:02:58.510 --> 07:02:58.520 align:start position:0%
actual
 
07:03:05.510 --> 07:03:05.520 align:start position:0%
Airway um so does that um justify not
 
07:03:07.910 --> 07:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
letting them exist I don't know I don't
 
07:03:10.670 --> 07:03:10.680 align:start position:0%
know that that's for me to say and I I
 
07:03:12.628 --> 07:03:12.638 align:start position:0%
feel like it might come to the
 
07:03:14.468 --> 07:03:14.478 align:start position:0%
veterinarians to decide this is
 
07:03:16.190 --> 07:03:16.200 align:start position:0%
suffering this isn't this is
 
07:03:19.190 --> 07:03:19.200 align:start position:0%
anatomically too much this isn't and I
 
07:03:21.350 --> 07:03:21.360 align:start position:0%
it's very gray I think that'd be very
 
07:03:21.360 --> 07:03:22.830 align:start position:0%
it's very gray I think that'd be very
hard

07:03:22.830 --> 07:03:22.840 align:start position:0%
hard
 
07:03:24.510 --> 07:03:24.520 align:start position:0%
when when do
 
07:03:29.430 --> 07:03:29.440 align:start position:0%
those when does the um the severity tend
 
07:03:34.110 --> 07:03:34.120 align:start position:0%
to show itself more prevalently I mean
 
07:03:37.670 --> 07:03:37.680 align:start position:0%
can you see that as a puppy can you see
 
07:03:40.510 --> 07:03:40.520 align:start position:0%
that does it does it take a couple of
 
07:03:43.070 --> 07:03:43.080 align:start position:0%
months or years to devel dep on the
 
07:03:43.080 --> 07:03:44.628 align:start position:0%
months or years to devel dep on the
condition

07:03:44.628 --> 07:03:44.638 align:start position:0%
condition
 
07:03:47.708 --> 07:03:47.718 align:start position:0%
Breaky um as other people have said um
 
07:03:49.990 --> 07:03:50.000 align:start position:0%
body weight and body condition has a lot
 
07:03:53.190 --> 07:03:53.200 align:start position:0%
to do with it so a puppy might look fine
 
07:03:55.150 --> 07:03:55.160 align:start position:0%
uh and then it grows up and it gets
 
07:03:57.150 --> 07:03:57.160 align:start position:0%
spayed and it gets overweight and then
 
07:03:59.788 --> 07:03:59.798 align:start position:0%
its breathing becomes worse so it really
 
07:04:01.110 --> 07:04:01.120 align:start position:0%
depends on the
 
07:04:03.830 --> 07:04:03.840 align:start position:0%
condition um if we're talking extremes I
 
07:04:05.750 --> 07:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
think most people would agree like the
 
07:04:10.510 --> 07:04:10.520 align:start position:0%
dog's passing out that's bad um it's the
 
07:04:14.190 --> 07:04:14.200 align:start position:0%
other less severe cases where there'd be
 
07:04:16.670 --> 07:04:16.680 align:start position:0%
a lot of disagreement even among experts
 
07:04:18.788 --> 07:04:18.798 align:start position:0%
about where it's what what about birth
 
07:04:21.868 --> 07:04:21.878 align:start position:0%
deformities like six-toed cats I mean
 
07:04:25.230 --> 07:04:25.240 align:start position:0%
does do cats have suffering with having
 
07:04:28.190 --> 07:04:28.200 align:start position:0%
six toes another Gray Zone yeah
 
07:04:30.510 --> 07:04:30.520 align:start position:0%
generally no I don't think so but some
 
07:04:32.788 --> 07:04:32.798 align:start position:0%
of those extra toes have this funky claw
 
07:04:34.910 --> 07:04:34.920 align:start position:0%
in the middle that if you don't trim it
 
07:04:37.310 --> 07:04:37.320 align:start position:0%
it grows around and embeds itself into
 
07:04:37.320 --> 07:04:37.990 align:start position:0%
it grows around and embeds itself into
the

07:04:37.990 --> 07:04:38.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
07:04:41.830 --> 07:04:41.840 align:start position:0%
foot so that's a husbandry issue more
 
07:04:44.548 --> 07:04:44.558 align:start position:0%
than a birth deformity
 
07:04:47.270 --> 07:04:47.280 align:start position:0%
issue yes that's a good point that there
 
07:04:49.750 --> 07:04:49.760 align:start position:0%
are lots of unintentional birth
 
07:04:53.190 --> 07:04:53.200 align:start position:0%
deformities that can cause suffering
 
07:04:55.830 --> 07:04:55.840 align:start position:0%
okay representative Penza and then
 
07:04:55.840 --> 07:04:57.868 align:start position:0%
okay representative Penza and then
representative

07:04:57.868 --> 07:04:57.878 align:start position:0%
representative
 
07:05:01.350 --> 07:05:01.360 align:start position:0%
Howard we might um I just want to I
 
07:05:03.150 --> 07:05:03.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony and you've
 
07:05:04.788 --> 07:05:04.798 align:start position:0%
stayed till the end and I think you're
 
07:05:06.708 --> 07:05:06.718 align:start position:0%
the last and I I think your testimony I
 
07:05:10.230 --> 07:05:10.240 align:start position:0%
wish it was heard by everyone else um I
 
07:05:12.270 --> 07:05:12.280 align:start position:0%
I think you got to the point of what
 
07:05:14.990 --> 07:05:15.000 align:start position:0%
most of us kind of feel here is do you
 
07:05:17.110 --> 07:05:17.120 align:start position:0%
feel like that the way that this is
 
07:05:18.990 --> 07:05:19.000 align:start position:0%
solved not through legislation but is
 
07:05:21.670 --> 07:05:21.680 align:start position:0%
through you know it's is it through
 
07:05:26.190 --> 07:05:26.200 align:start position:0%
breeders and vets and um in the Humane
 
07:05:29.948 --> 07:05:29.958 align:start position:0%
Society working together to try to um to
 
07:05:32.430 --> 07:05:32.440 align:start position:0%
get to a point where do you know what
 
07:05:35.830 --> 07:05:35.840 align:start position:0%
I'm saying yeah I um I wasn't gonna say
 
07:05:39.388 --> 07:05:39.398 align:start position:0%
this but I was recently on the um Animal
 
07:05:41.990 --> 07:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
Welfare committee for the American
 
07:05:44.230 --> 07:05:44.240 align:start position:0%
Association of feline practitioners it's
 
07:05:47.430 --> 07:05:47.440 align:start position:0%
like the National Cat vet Association
 
07:05:49.150 --> 07:05:49.160 align:start position:0%
and we just crafted a statement on
 
07:05:53.990 --> 07:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
Breaky seil and cat breeding um and um
 
07:05:56.150 --> 07:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
so there's a lot of discussion about
 
07:05:59.150 --> 07:05:59.160 align:start position:0%
this um this position statement we
 
07:06:02.070 --> 07:06:02.080 align:start position:0%
crafted does not include any legislative
 
07:06:04.548 --> 07:06:04.558 align:start position:0%
bans or prohibitions it's more about
 
07:06:07.628 --> 07:06:07.638 align:start position:0%
what you've described um changing breed
 
07:06:10.910 --> 07:06:10.920 align:start position:0%
standards and breeding animals with the
 
07:06:13.990 --> 07:06:14.000 align:start position:0%
priority being their health rather than
 
07:06:17.830 --> 07:06:17.840 align:start position:0%
the consumer's desire for cuteness um or
 
07:06:17.840 --> 07:06:19.910 align:start position:0%
the consumer's desire for cuteness um or
whatever

07:06:19.910 --> 07:06:19.920 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
07:06:24.270 --> 07:06:24.280 align:start position:0%
um so yes I think that there's already a
 
07:06:28.868 --> 07:06:28.878 align:start position:0%
lot of that discussion happening um and
 
07:06:30.670 --> 07:06:30.680 align:start position:0%
I don't know how you would legislate it
 
07:06:33.468 --> 07:06:33.478 align:start position:0%
and make it fair and and and have it be
 
07:06:33.478 --> 07:06:35.150 align:start position:0%
and make it fair and and and have it be
actual

07:06:35.150 --> 07:06:35.160 align:start position:0%
actual
 
07:06:38.310 --> 07:06:38.320 align:start position:0%
useful representative Howard thank you
 
07:06:41.388 --> 07:06:41.398 align:start position:0%
madam chair um so I'm I you cast a
 
07:06:43.910 --> 07:06:43.920 align:start position:0%
little confusion on on what a conclusion
 
07:06:46.830 --> 07:06:46.840 align:start position:0%
that I had come to before so you said um
 
07:06:50.230 --> 07:06:50.240 align:start position:0%
I don't know if this problem is worth
 
07:06:52.350 --> 07:06:52.360 align:start position:0%
getting rid you know Banning the the
 
07:06:54.910 --> 07:06:54.920 align:start position:0%
breed so so I guess just for
 
07:06:59.388 --> 07:06:59.398 align:start position:0%
clarification for my for my sake is the
 
07:07:02.830 --> 07:07:02.840 align:start position:0%
is the the breeds are these this type of
 
07:07:04.948 --> 07:07:04.958 align:start position:0%
um of
 
07:07:07.670 --> 07:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
anatomy absolutely prone toward this or
 
07:07:09.230 --> 07:07:09.240 align:start position:0%
I mean I I you said that it has to do
 
07:07:10.868 --> 07:07:10.878 align:start position:0%
with body weight and all that stuff I I
 
07:07:13.590 --> 07:07:13.600 align:start position:0%
understand there's complications but but
 
07:07:17.830 --> 07:07:17.840 align:start position:0%
um is is it I mean it's sort of you took
 
07:07:20.510 --> 07:07:20.520 align:start position:0%
me back to square one when you said
 
07:07:25.110 --> 07:07:25.120 align:start position:0%
that so your question is um is it really
 
07:07:28.788 --> 07:07:28.798 align:start position:0%
the anatomy that's the problem or is
 
07:07:33.388 --> 07:07:33.398 align:start position:0%
it in the case of Breaky short noses um
 
07:07:37.948 --> 07:07:37.958 align:start position:0%
I think that's a big part of it um and
 
07:07:40.948 --> 07:07:40.958 align:start position:0%
the the problems that those dogs and
 
07:07:43.948 --> 07:07:43.958 align:start position:0%
cats have uh their nostrils are too
 
07:07:46.990 --> 07:07:47.000 align:start position:0%
narrow their trachea is too small can't
 
07:07:49.628 --> 07:07:49.638 align:start position:0%
really fix that um and then they have
 
07:07:51.030 --> 07:07:51.040 align:start position:0%
some problems with their larynx and
 
07:07:56.150 --> 07:07:56.160 align:start position:0%
their pal it um and to me
 
07:07:58.628 --> 07:07:58.638 align:start position:0%
anatomically we've we've taken their
 
07:08:01.430 --> 07:08:01.440 align:start position:0%
skull and bred it to be short and their
 
07:08:04.310 --> 07:08:04.320 align:start position:0%
nose their facial bones to be short but
 
07:08:07.708 --> 07:08:07.718 align:start position:0%
all the soft tissue kind of stays pretty
 
07:08:09.468 --> 07:08:09.478 align:start position:0%
the same that's why their tongues stick
 
07:08:11.270 --> 07:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
out so far when you look into their
 
07:08:14.190 --> 07:08:14.200 align:start position:0%
throat there's folds of tissue and
 
07:08:17.468 --> 07:08:17.478 align:start position:0%
there's just stuff in the way um so I
 
07:08:19.388 --> 07:08:19.398 align:start position:0%
think there's a pretty clear Connection
 
07:08:21.948 --> 07:08:21.958 align:start position:0%
in my mind that the anatomy
 
07:08:24.350 --> 07:08:24.360 align:start position:0%
it's just making it hard for them to
 
07:08:24.360 --> 07:08:26.230 align:start position:0%
it's just making it hard for them to
move

07:08:26.230 --> 07:08:26.240 align:start position:0%
move
 
07:08:29.430 --> 07:08:29.440 align:start position:0%
air I think so I mean I I haven't looked
 
07:08:31.590 --> 07:08:31.600 align:start position:0%
at all the studies and I can't speak to
 
07:08:35.030 --> 07:08:35.040 align:start position:0%
that but um when I look into those
 
07:08:38.350 --> 07:08:38.360 align:start position:0%
throats it's narrow it's like you can't
 
07:08:40.990 --> 07:08:41.000 align:start position:0%
fit a normal siiz endot tral tube into
 
07:08:43.510 --> 07:08:43.520 align:start position:0%
some of these throats you have to put a
 
07:08:45.430 --> 07:08:45.440 align:start position:0%
smaller one in than you'd expect for the
 
07:08:49.150 --> 07:08:49.160 align:start position:0%
size of the dog so I I think there's a
 
07:08:52.030 --> 07:08:52.040 align:start position:0%
true um
 
07:08:52.040 --> 07:08:53.030 align:start position:0%
true um
yeah

07:08:53.030 --> 07:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
07:08:56.110 --> 07:08:56.120 align:start position:0%
yeah representative kto thank you madam
 
07:08:59.230 --> 07:08:59.240 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you again um having
 
07:09:04.230 --> 07:09:04.240 align:start position:0%
owned uh some of the breeds uh
 
07:09:08.548 --> 07:09:08.558 align:start position:0%
listed and not having any issues at all
 
07:09:08.558 --> 07:09:09.350 align:start position:0%
listed and not having any issues at all
with

07:09:09.350 --> 07:09:09.360 align:start position:0%
with
 
07:09:13.350 --> 07:09:13.360 align:start position:0%
breathing and then having uh other
 
07:09:16.468 --> 07:09:16.478 align:start position:0%
breeds great pair crosses uh that I have
 
07:09:16.478 --> 07:09:17.948 align:start position:0%
breeds great pair crosses uh that I have
bred

07:09:17.948 --> 07:09:17.958 align:start position:0%
bred
 
07:09:20.750 --> 07:09:20.760 align:start position:0%
uh and what I have found in my
 
07:09:20.760 --> 07:09:22.150 align:start position:0%
uh and what I have found in my
experience

07:09:22.150 --> 07:09:22.160 align:start position:0%
experience
 
07:09:25.350 --> 07:09:25.360 align:start position:0%
and maybe you can attested it is that it
 
07:09:28.430 --> 07:09:28.440 align:start position:0%
anatomically someone a dog may be more
 
07:09:30.510 --> 07:09:30.520 align:start position:0%
prone to something you know like I
 
07:09:32.548 --> 07:09:32.558 align:start position:0%
testified said earlier I had a dog that
 
07:09:35.388 --> 07:09:35.398 align:start position:0%
was prone to HP topasia obviously uh the
 
07:09:37.670 --> 07:09:37.680 align:start position:0%
box or the sharpi and the Rott Wier
 
07:09:40.948 --> 07:09:40.958 align:start position:0%
which uh you're saying is prone to the
 
07:09:43.830 --> 07:09:43.840 align:start position:0%
Boaz however I never experienced any of
 
07:09:47.310 --> 07:09:47.320 align:start position:0%
that but U my great peer that I had no
 
07:09:50.110 --> 07:09:50.120 align:start position:0%
issues with and plenty of litters that
 
07:09:53.230 --> 07:09:53.240 align:start position:0%
never had an issue I ran to someone that
 
07:09:56.388 --> 07:09:56.398 align:start position:0%
they had one of my pups that had
 
07:10:00.070 --> 07:10:00.080 align:start position:0%
allergies the first one in like 30 dogs
 
07:10:04.190 --> 07:10:04.200 align:start position:0%
right um however I think that
 
07:10:06.830 --> 07:10:06.840 align:start position:0%
environmental issues as we discussed
 
07:10:10.230 --> 07:10:10.240 align:start position:0%
earlier including how they're fed
 
07:10:12.150 --> 07:10:12.160 align:start position:0%
because we're talking body weight and
 
07:10:14.628 --> 07:10:14.638 align:start position:0%
things like that have a lot to do with a
 
07:10:17.548 --> 07:10:17.558 align:start position:0%
lot of these issues um what what would
 
07:10:20.230 --> 07:10:20.240 align:start position:0%
you say I agree
 
07:10:20.240 --> 07:10:21.750 align:start position:0%
you say I agree
completely

07:10:21.750 --> 07:10:21.760 align:start position:0%
completely
 
07:10:23.628 --> 07:10:23.638 align:start position:0%
if you have uh
 
07:10:26.708 --> 07:10:26.718 align:start position:0%
Boaz and your overweight your Boaz will
 
07:10:28.388 --> 07:10:28.398 align:start position:0%
be worse just like if you have sleep
 
07:10:31.150 --> 07:10:31.160 align:start position:0%
apnea and your overweight you have worse
 
07:10:32.990 --> 07:10:33.000 align:start position:0%
sleep lapa and if you lost the weight
 
07:10:34.590 --> 07:10:34.600 align:start position:0%
you'd breathe
 
07:10:37.430 --> 07:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
better thank you yeah any other
 
07:10:40.708 --> 07:10:40.718 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee seeing none
 
07:10:42.990 --> 07:10:43.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for coming today is
 
07:10:50.150 --> 07:10:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:10:50.160 --> 07:10:52.590 align:start position:0%
 
speak

07:10:52.590 --> 07:10:52.600 align:start position:0%
speak
 
07:10:54.910 --> 07:10:54.920 align:start position:0%
of different animals there's a short
 
07:10:59.150 --> 07:10:59.160 align:start position:0%
bear and a giant kangaroo they were all
 
07:11:02.070 --> 07:11:02.080 align:start position:0%
naturally so it's not something we
 
07:11:06.468 --> 07:11:06.478 align:start position:0%
invented for no reason okay thank
 
07:11:06.478 --> 07:11:20.150 align:start position:0%
invented for no reason okay thank
you

07:11:20.150 --> 07:11:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:11:20.160 --> 07:11:36.910 align:start position:0%
 
sure

07:11:36.910 --> 07:11:36.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:11:41.310 --> 07:11:41.320 align:start position:0%
I know thank you okay thank you want to
 
07:11:43.590 --> 07:11:43.600 align:start position:0%
thank you all for hanging in there and
 
07:11:45.708 --> 07:11:45.718 align:start position:0%
staying as long and I also want to thank

my committee for um for all your uh
 
07:11:52.510 --> 07:11:52.520 align:start position:0%
attention and good questions afternoon
 
07:11:54.430 --> 07:11:54.440 align:start position:0%
and uh I guess we'll see you tomorrow
 
07:11:58.150 --> 07:11:58.160 align:start position:0%
morning I'm GNA I'm gonna I'm going to
