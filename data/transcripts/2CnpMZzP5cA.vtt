00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:49.640 align:start position:0%
to our knees nothing was plowed on that
 
00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:51.600 align:start position:0%

there was just nothing on the side you
 
00:20:07.710 --> 00:20:07.720 align:start position:0%
didn't know where the road was and so

00:27:16.269 --> 00:27:16.279 align:start position:0%
before no actually Mr chair we uh we did
 
00:27:20.110 --> 00:27:20.120 align:start position:0%
circulate the amendment at the uh work
 
00:27:23.430 --> 00:27:23.440 align:start position:0%
session on um on these bills last week
 
00:27:25.549 --> 00:27:25.559 align:start position:0%

00:27:33.549 --> 00:27:33.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:36.590 --> 00:27:36.600 align:start position:0%
file okay uh go ahead and and once again
 
00:27:38.149 --> 00:27:38.159 align:start position:0%

00:27:39.710 --> 00:27:39.720 align:start position:0%
amendment's all about sure thank you
 
00:27:42.070 --> 00:27:42.080 align:start position:0%
very much Mr chair so uh so the
 
00:27:45.190 --> 00:27:45.200 align:start position:0%
underlying bills House Bill 583 which
 
00:27:47.230 --> 00:27:47.240 align:start position:0%
would um which would have the uh
 
00:27:50.509 --> 00:27:50.519 align:start position:0%
Department of Education apply to the um
 
00:27:54.310 --> 00:27:54.320 align:start position:0%
the USDA for uh for participation in the
 
00:27:56.389 --> 00:27:56.399 align:start position:0%
Medicaid direct certification pilot
 
00:27:59.909 --> 00:27:59.919 align:start position:0%
program and uh what this means is um is
 
00:28:01.990 --> 00:28:02.000 align:start position:0%
school districts all across the state
 
00:28:05.110 --> 00:28:05.120 align:start position:0%
who uh who who are are participate who
 
00:28:07.190 --> 00:28:07.200 align:start position:0%
participate in the usda's free and
 
00:28:09.029 --> 00:28:09.039 align:start position:0%
reduced price lunch program would no
 
00:28:11.830 --> 00:28:11.840 align:start position:0%
longer have to have uh students in th in
 
00:28:15.070 --> 00:28:15.080 align:start position:0%
those districts fill out paperwork to uh
 
00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:19.440 align:start position:0%
to uh uh to qualify for the program they
 
00:28:22.789 --> 00:28:22.799 align:start position:0%
would be qualified by virtue of their um
 
00:28:26.509 --> 00:28:26.519 align:start position:0%
their uh their U enrollment in in
 
00:28:30.549 --> 00:28:30.559 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and we heard from the um the
 
00:28:34.430 --> 00:28:34.440 align:start position:0%
director of um who directs the Medicaid
 
00:28:36.789 --> 00:28:36.799 align:start position:0%
Program in New Hampshire that uh that
 
00:28:40.149 --> 00:28:40.159 align:start position:0%
they'd be able to have an opt out um uh
 
00:28:41.669 --> 00:28:41.679 align:start position:0%
you know during the um during the
 
00:28:45.070 --> 00:28:45.080 align:start position:0%
Medicaid enrollment um process but um
 
00:28:47.909 --> 00:28:47.919 align:start position:0%
but basically again the underlying Bill
 
00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:51.360 align:start position:0%
itself would uh would identify uh an
 
00:28:53.950 --> 00:28:53.960 align:start position:0%
additional proximately 10,000 students
 
00:28:56.149 --> 00:28:56.159 align:start position:0%
and that's what's in the second handout
 
00:28:58.230 --> 00:28:58.240 align:start position:0%
that went around that has the list of
 
00:29:00.830 --> 00:29:00.840 align:start position:0%
all the cities and towns and um and it's
 
00:29:03.909 --> 00:29:03.919 align:start position:0%
a little buggy that it was produced by
 
00:29:06.909 --> 00:29:06.919 align:start position:0%
by um Department of Education uh uh a
 
00:29:10.590 --> 00:29:10.600 align:start position:0%
year ago and um and U Mark manginello
 
00:29:12.509 --> 00:29:12.519 align:start position:0%
who produced it said yeah there's
 
00:29:14.710 --> 00:29:14.720 align:start position:0%
there's there's a couple um there's some
 
00:29:17.509 --> 00:29:17.519 align:start position:0%
bugs in it that I think probably go in
 
00:29:19.789 --> 00:29:19.799 align:start position:0%
both directions but you can see that
 
00:29:21.669 --> 00:29:21.679 align:start position:0%
that throughout the state uh with
 
00:29:23.590 --> 00:29:23.600 align:start position:0%
Medicaid direct certification as opposed
 
00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:25.440 align:start position:0%
to just using the free and redu price
 
00:29:28.750 --> 00:29:28.760 align:start position:0%
lunch um paperwork that we identify
 
00:29:31.789 --> 00:29:31.799 align:start position:0%
about another 10,000 students Statewide
 
00:29:33.950 --> 00:29:33.960 align:start position:0%
that would uh would qualify for free and
 
00:29:38.750 --> 00:29:38.760 align:start position:0%
reduced price lunch and um and as um as
 
00:29:41.950 --> 00:29:41.960 align:start position:0%
many of us who have who have you know
 
00:29:44.830 --> 00:29:44.840 align:start position:0%
been involved in in school funding so
 
00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:46.320 align:start position:0%
you know that what what I've just been
 
00:29:48.310 --> 00:29:48.320 align:start position:0%
talking about is is basically you know
 
00:29:51.870 --> 00:29:51.880 align:start position:0%
feeding kids feeding kids from lowincome
 
00:29:54.310 --> 00:29:54.320 align:start position:0%
uh backgrounds uh making sure that they
 
00:29:57.230 --> 00:29:57.240 align:start position:0%
can get a free reduced price lunch that
 
00:30:01.029 --> 00:30:01.039 align:start position:0%
is paid for by the US Department of um
 
00:30:05.509 --> 00:30:05.519 align:start position:0%
of Agriculture so um uh so the what the
 
00:30:07.870 --> 00:30:07.880 align:start position:0%
amendment does and it's and it really
 
00:30:12.310 --> 00:30:12.320 align:start position:0%
happens in section two here is um is it
 
00:30:15.830 --> 00:30:15.840 align:start position:0%
it provides a budget neutral impact when
 
00:30:17.950 --> 00:30:17.960 align:start position:0%
it comes to using the free introduced
 
00:30:22.029 --> 00:30:22.039 align:start position:0%
price lunch ADM uh data uh in the school
 
00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:24.480 align:start position:0%
funding formula so it would hold the
 
00:30:27.110 --> 00:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
school funding formula used for the FY
 
00:30:30.470 --> 00:30:30.480 align:start position:0%
26 and y 27 budget so the budget that's
 
00:30:33.590 --> 00:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
being you know that the governor um
 
00:30:36.110 --> 00:30:36.120 align:start position:0%
introduced last week it would uh it
 
00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
would be budget neutral so it would hold
 
00:30:41.630 --> 00:30:41.640 align:start position:0%
the those um those different the
 
00:30:44.149 --> 00:30:44.159 align:start position:0%
differentiated Aid and the the
 
00:30:46.350 --> 00:30:46.360 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs Grant uh which are
 
00:30:49.029 --> 00:30:49.039 align:start position:0%
both both calculated based on the free
 
00:30:50.630 --> 00:30:50.640 align:start position:0%
introduced price lunch
 
00:30:54.509 --> 00:30:54.519 align:start position:0%
membership it would hold those steady uh
 
00:30:57.549 --> 00:30:57.559 align:start position:0%
based on the fy2 the current school year
 
00:30:59.750 --> 00:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
that we're in so it wouldn't have any
 
00:31:03.870 --> 00:31:03.880 align:start position:0%
impact on adequacy um uh had we not put
 
00:31:07.750 --> 00:31:07.760 align:start position:0%
um uh section two uh in in the amendment
 
00:31:10.350 --> 00:31:10.360 align:start position:0%
you'd basically see the adequacy grant
 
00:31:13.629 --> 00:31:13.639 align:start position:0%
go up based on these additional 10,000
 
00:31:16.470 --> 00:31:16.480 align:start position:0%
students and uh would go up by um I
 
00:31:21.669 --> 00:31:21.679 align:start position:0%
think it's 20 2,300 $2,300 per 2392 so
 
00:31:21.679 --> 00:31:22.629 align:start position:0%
think it's 20 2,300 $2,300 per 2392 so
almost

00:31:22.629 --> 00:31:22.639 align:start position:0%
almost
 
00:31:25.310 --> 00:31:25.320 align:start position:0%
$2400 per student so it would be a $24
 
00:31:28.389 --> 00:31:28.399 align:start position:0%
million impact in each of the of the two
 
00:31:31.470 --> 00:31:31.480 align:start position:0%
years so the amendment makes that budget
 
00:31:34.710 --> 00:31:34.720 align:start position:0%
neutral um and um and why do we want to
 
00:31:36.549 --> 00:31:36.559 align:start position:0%
make it budget neutral because we feel
 
00:31:39.509 --> 00:31:39.519 align:start position:0%
that the policy is very important to uh
 
00:31:42.149 --> 00:31:42.159 align:start position:0%
to make sure that that number one we're
 
00:31:46.149 --> 00:31:46.159 align:start position:0%
we're identifying the um uh eligible you
 
00:31:48.149 --> 00:31:48.159 align:start position:0%
know students who are eligible for free
 
00:31:50.590 --> 00:31:50.600 align:start position:0%
and reduced price lunch as 43 other
 
00:31:53.029 --> 00:31:53.039 align:start position:0%
states um uh currently do it today we're
 
00:31:55.629 --> 00:31:55.639 align:start position:0%
able to use the Medicaid data uh with a
 
00:31:58.909 --> 00:31:58.919 align:start position:0%
secure uh handoff between
 
00:32:01.509 --> 00:32:01.519 align:start position:0%
DHHS and um and the Department of
 
00:32:05.389 --> 00:32:05.399 align:start position:0%
Education um and DHHS has testified that
 
00:32:08.710 --> 00:32:08.720 align:start position:0%
they're able to put a um put a opt out
 
00:32:11.029 --> 00:32:11.039 align:start position:0%
uh section in there for for Medicaid
 
00:32:12.509 --> 00:32:12.519 align:start position:0%
families when they're when they're
 
00:32:14.230 --> 00:32:14.240 align:start position:0%
applying if they don't want to be
 
00:32:15.430 --> 00:32:15.440 align:start position:0%
considered as part of the free
 
00:32:18.750 --> 00:32:18.760 align:start position:0%
introduced price lunch program so that's
 
00:32:21.149 --> 00:32:21.159 align:start position:0%
that's a big reason to it the there are
 
00:32:23.230 --> 00:32:23.240 align:start position:0%
two additional reasons why Medicaid
 
00:32:25.710 --> 00:32:25.720 align:start position:0%
direct certification is really important
 
00:32:28.590 --> 00:32:28.600 align:start position:0%
down the road obviously we're looking at
 
00:32:29.950 --> 00:32:29.960 align:start position:0%
uh at doing something with the school
 
00:32:32.909 --> 00:32:32.919 align:start position:0%
funding formula and uh and clearly uh
 
00:32:34.430 --> 00:32:34.440 align:start position:0%
students that come from low-income
 
00:32:38.230 --> 00:32:38.240 align:start position:0%
backgrounds have um uh are provide
 
00:32:40.430 --> 00:32:40.440 align:start position:0%
challenges uh to school districts I like
 
00:32:42.190 --> 00:32:42.200 align:start position:0%
to say you know what it costs more to
 
00:32:43.950 --> 00:32:43.960 align:start position:0%
educate a thousand kids in Manchester
 
00:32:46.350 --> 00:32:46.360 align:start position:0%
than it does a thousand kids in Bedford
 
00:32:49.070 --> 00:32:49.080 align:start position:0%
because the challenges are different and
 
00:32:51.509 --> 00:32:51.519 align:start position:0%
um and so I think we would want to as a
 
00:32:54.629 --> 00:32:54.639 align:start position:0%
state since we're relying on on free
 
00:32:56.830 --> 00:32:56.840 align:start position:0%
introduced price lunch membership as a
 
00:33:00.070 --> 00:33:00.080 align:start position:0%
proxy for families um with students well
 
00:33:02.389 --> 00:33:02.399 align:start position:0%
from students with lowincome backgrounds
 
00:33:04.269 --> 00:33:04.279 align:start position:0%
that we'd want to at least use accurate
 
00:33:06.430 --> 00:33:06.440 align:start position:0%
data and Medicaid direct certification
 
00:33:09.310 --> 00:33:09.320 align:start position:0%
would provide that accurate data uh for
 
00:33:11.310 --> 00:33:11.320 align:start position:0%
use in the school funding formula but
 
00:33:13.350 --> 00:33:13.360 align:start position:0%
let's make it budget neutral we're going
 
00:33:15.549 --> 00:33:15.559 align:start position:0%
to push that off for U for at least a
 
00:33:18.870 --> 00:33:18.880 align:start position:0%
couple years the third thing um that's
 
00:33:21.789 --> 00:33:21.799 align:start position:0%
that's important for this is that um the
 
00:33:24.789 --> 00:33:24.799 align:start position:0%
the free and reduced price lunch
 
00:33:28.269 --> 00:33:28.279 align:start position:0%
information is used by the
 
00:33:30.029 --> 00:33:30.039 align:start position:0%
by Health and Human Services at the
 
00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:32.760 align:start position:0%
federal level to calculate the child
 
00:33:35.430 --> 00:33:35.440 align:start position:0%
care scholarship that the state receives
 
00:33:37.950 --> 00:33:37.960 align:start position:0%
that it can give out to uh to qualified
 
00:33:41.789 --> 00:33:41.799 align:start position:0%
families to help um um Child Care become
 
00:33:44.710 --> 00:33:44.720 align:start position:0%
more affordable and uh and and you know
 
00:33:46.710 --> 00:33:46.720 align:start position:0%
anybody that's seen the news in the last
 
00:33:48.509 --> 00:33:48.519 align:start position:0%
couple days is aware of the recent
 
00:33:50.070 --> 00:33:50.080 align:start position:0%
report from the New Hampshire fiscal
 
00:33:53.950 --> 00:33:53.960 align:start position:0%
policy Institute uh talking about how um
 
00:33:56.190 --> 00:33:56.200 align:start position:0%
how the average child care cost for uh
 
00:33:58.430 --> 00:33:58.440 align:start position:0%
for two kids in childcare is running
 
00:34:02.230 --> 00:34:02.240 align:start position:0%
families about $32,000 a year so um so
 
00:34:05.310 --> 00:34:05.320 align:start position:0%
this brings money into the state from uh
 
00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
from a Federal grant tied to free
 
00:34:10.629 --> 00:34:10.639 align:start position:0%
introduced price lunch membership and um
 
00:34:12.710 --> 00:34:12.720 align:start position:0%
and the Medicaid direct certification
 
00:34:16.270 --> 00:34:16.280 align:start position:0%
helps us do that so so the the you know
 
00:34:18.629 --> 00:34:18.639 align:start position:0%
all in all these are these are all
 
00:34:21.990 --> 00:34:22.000 align:start position:0%
really good reasons why the why we feel
 
00:34:24.190 --> 00:34:24.200 align:start position:0%
the the Medicaid direct certification is
 
00:34:26.510 --> 00:34:26.520 align:start position:0%
important I guess one final thing and
 
00:34:27.869 --> 00:34:27.879 align:start position:0%
we've never we haven't really talked
 
00:34:30.629 --> 00:34:30.639 align:start position:0%
much about this is that um is that in
 
00:34:33.430 --> 00:34:33.440 align:start position:0%
many cases the reimbursement amount that
 
00:34:36.030 --> 00:34:36.040 align:start position:0%
school districts receive for free Andrew
 
00:34:38.829 --> 00:34:38.839 align:start position:0%
price lunch is higher than their um than
 
00:34:40.829 --> 00:34:40.839 align:start position:0%
their retail price that they charge for
 
00:34:43.109 --> 00:34:43.119 align:start position:0%
lunch so many districts actually come
 
00:34:45.510 --> 00:34:45.520 align:start position:0%
out ahead when they get when they when
 
00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
they quote sell a free and reduced price
 
00:34:49.990 --> 00:34:50.000 align:start position:0%
lunch meal uh rather than paying you
 
00:34:52.990 --> 00:34:53.000 align:start position:0%
know the the the sticker price um you
 
00:34:55.829 --> 00:34:55.839 align:start position:0%
know for that uh for that lunch so so
 
00:34:58.109 --> 00:34:58.119 align:start position:0%
these are all really strong things you
 
00:35:00.990 --> 00:35:01.000 align:start position:0%
can take a look at the Town by town and
 
00:35:03.190 --> 00:35:03.200 align:start position:0%
um and again with the with the caveat
 
00:35:04.990 --> 00:35:05.000 align:start position:0%
that it's a little bit buggy but I think
 
00:35:07.790 --> 00:35:07.800 align:start position:0%
it's in General close and um and you can
 
00:35:10.230 --> 00:35:10.240 align:start position:0%
see the impact uh it has in the
 
00:35:11.589 --> 00:35:11.599 align:start position:0%
communities you serve and the
 
00:35:13.430 --> 00:35:13.440 align:start position:0%
communities all across the state and
 
00:35:15.910 --> 00:35:15.920 align:start position:0%
it's about $1,000 per student that's the
 
00:35:18.109 --> 00:35:18.119 align:start position:0%
savings for families so when you take a
 
00:35:19.109 --> 00:35:19.119 align:start position:0%
look at
 
00:35:22.510 --> 00:35:22.520 align:start position:0%
Manchester and um and uh where do I find
 
00:35:26.710 --> 00:35:26.720 align:start position:0%
it here um um Manchester seeing about an
 
00:35:29.349 --> 00:35:29.359 align:start position:0%
1100 student increase with Medicaid
 
00:35:31.069 --> 00:35:31.079 align:start position:0%
direct certification versus having
 
00:35:32.750 --> 00:35:32.760 align:start position:0%
chasing around kids for free introduced
 
00:35:35.910 --> 00:35:35.920 align:start position:0%
PR lunch paperwork that's a um you know
 
00:35:38.390 --> 00:35:38.400 align:start position:0%
that's a that's a a million dollar you
 
00:35:39.670 --> 00:35:39.680 align:start position:0%
know $1.1
 
00:35:43.030 --> 00:35:43.040 align:start position:0%
million uh savings for uh for low-income
 
00:35:46.150 --> 00:35:46.160 align:start position:0%
families in the uh in in the Queen City
 
00:35:49.150 --> 00:35:49.160 align:start position:0%
so uh so we hope people will find this
 
00:35:52.030 --> 00:35:52.040 align:start position:0%
this bill to be and you know something
 
00:35:53.829 --> 00:35:53.839 align:start position:0%
that uh that we can move forward with as
 
00:35:56.910 --> 00:35:56.920 align:start position:0%
a state with this amendment uh given the
 
00:35:59.230 --> 00:35:59.240 align:start position:0%
U the bud challenges we're facing thank
 
00:36:00.910 --> 00:36:00.920 align:start position:0%
you okay thank you very thank you very
 
00:36:02.589 --> 00:36:02.599 align:start position:0%

caucus at this time so we're going to
 
00:36:08.230 --> 00:36:08.240 align:start position:0%

are you going to be caucusing in the
 
00:36:12.030 --> 00:36:12.040 align:start position:0%

said Thank you thank you so much for
 
00:55:20.710 --> 00:55:20.720 align:start position:0%
checking um I just will be brief because
 
00:55:22.589 --> 00:55:22.599 align:start position:0%
we've had extensive discussions about
 
00:55:24.589 --> 00:55:24.599 align:start position:0%
this bill the previous term and this
 
00:55:26.870 --> 00:55:26.880 align:start position:0%
term I appreciate intent of the
 
00:55:28.390 --> 00:55:28.400 align:start position:0%
amendment but at the end of the day all
 
00:55:30.430 --> 00:55:30.440 align:start position:0%
it does is that it kicks the can down
 
00:55:32.549 --> 00:55:32.559 align:start position:0%
the road for two years I don't think
 
00:55:35.150 --> 00:55:35.160 align:start position:0%
that something that's not good policy if
 
00:55:37.069 --> 00:55:37.079 align:start position:0%
adopted as is will be good policy
 
00:55:39.430 --> 00:55:39.440 align:start position:0%
because we delay the massive Financial
 
00:55:42.430 --> 00:55:42.440 align:start position:0%
impact for two years so for that reason
 
00:55:44.710 --> 00:55:44.720 align:start position:0%
I'd like to uh move forward to the ideal
 
00:55:47.670 --> 00:55:47.680 align:start position:0%
motion on the bill as is thank you is
 
00:55:51.109 --> 00:55:51.119 align:start position:0%
the maker the second got anything to say
 
00:55:55.029 --> 00:55:55.039 align:start position:0%
I'll just say that um there's a lot of
 
00:55:57.870 --> 00:55:57.880 align:start position:0%
parts of the adequate formula even on
 
00:56:00.109 --> 00:56:00.119 align:start position:0%
the right hand side that depend on free
 
00:56:05.309 --> 00:56:05.319 align:start position:0%
and reduced lunch numbers and so um
 
00:56:08.789 --> 00:56:08.799 align:start position:0%
changing those has a lot of
 
00:56:10.710 --> 00:56:10.720 align:start position:0%
implications for
 
00:56:13.510 --> 00:56:13.520 align:start position:0%
funding thank you further discussion yes
 
00:56:15.789 --> 00:56:15.799 align:start position:0%
represent luno thanks very much I'm
 
00:56:17.190 --> 00:56:17.200 align:start position:0%
actually really glad that you guys are
 
00:56:19.109 --> 00:56:19.119 align:start position:0%
making the motion for itl and we'll
 
00:56:21.270 --> 00:56:21.280 align:start position:0%
certainly be um be roll calling this and
 
00:56:23.390 --> 00:56:23.400 align:start position:0%
fighting this on the floor but it does
 
00:56:25.390 --> 00:56:25.400 align:start position:0%
not uh Kick the Can down the road in
 
00:56:28.670 --> 00:56:28.680 align:start position:0%
fact it uh it immediately uh would uh
 
00:56:31.990 --> 00:56:32.000 align:start position:0%
would begin um um enrolling uh kids from
 
00:56:34.670 --> 00:56:34.680 align:start position:0%
low-income families in the federal USDA
 
00:56:36.549 --> 00:56:36.559 align:start position:0%
Grant so that they can begin eating
 
00:56:38.829 --> 00:56:38.839 align:start position:0%
we're talking about 10,000 kids who are
 
00:56:40.750 --> 00:56:40.760 align:start position:0%
live all across the state so it begins
 
00:56:43.670 --> 00:56:43.680 align:start position:0%
feeding kids immediately it also
 
00:56:45.150 --> 00:56:45.160 align:start position:0%
provides the state with an accurate
 
00:56:47.230 --> 00:56:47.240 align:start position:0%
number not a make believe number when it
 
00:56:50.430 --> 00:56:50.440 align:start position:0%
comes to identifying the um the number
 
00:56:52.190 --> 00:56:52.200 align:start position:0%
of uh of kids from low-income
 
00:56:54.190 --> 00:56:54.200 align:start position:0%
backgrounds that uh that attend our
 
00:56:56.630 --> 00:56:56.640 align:start position:0%
public schools and and obviously we're
 
00:56:58.190 --> 00:56:58.200 align:start position:0%
all we all know that that's part of the
 
00:57:00.150 --> 00:57:00.160 align:start position:0%
adequacy funding formula but with an
 
00:57:02.430 --> 00:57:02.440 align:start position:0%
amendment it uh would would also
 
00:57:05.029 --> 00:57:05.039 align:start position:0%
recognize the budget challenges so if
 
00:57:07.309 --> 00:57:07.319 align:start position:0%
kicking the can down the road means
 
00:57:09.910 --> 00:57:09.920 align:start position:0%
having it having um accurate numbers for
 
00:57:12.190 --> 00:57:12.200 align:start position:0%
our funding formula yeah but that that
 
00:57:14.150 --> 00:57:14.160 align:start position:0%
certainly doesn't sound like um a
 
00:57:15.950 --> 00:57:15.960 align:start position:0%
financially responsible type of
 
00:57:17.829 --> 00:57:17.839 align:start position:0%
statement to make the third thing it
 
00:57:22.150 --> 00:57:22.160 align:start position:0%
does is um is um is directs uh more
 
00:57:23.990 --> 00:57:24.000 align:start position:0%
federal health and human services money
 
00:57:25.789 --> 00:57:25.799 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire for the child care
 
00:57:27.230 --> 00:57:27.240 align:start position:0%
scholar ship and we're talking about
 
00:57:29.589 --> 00:57:29.599 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars that can that
 
00:57:32.589 --> 00:57:32.599 align:start position:0%
families that are that are struggling uh
 
00:57:35.349 --> 00:57:35.359 align:start position:0%
uh toh to pay for child care and uh we
 
00:57:36.990 --> 00:57:37.000 align:start position:0%
can see from the most recent New
 
00:57:39.029 --> 00:57:39.039 align:start position:0%
Hampshire fiscal policy report what
 
00:57:41.029 --> 00:57:41.039 align:start position:0%
impact that has on Workforce and our
 
00:57:44.470 --> 00:57:44.480 align:start position:0%
economy the for thing it does is uh is
 
00:57:47.150 --> 00:57:47.160 align:start position:0%
it actually increases um revenues for
 
00:57:49.069 --> 00:57:49.079 align:start position:0%
our local school districts who most of
 
00:57:51.190 --> 00:57:51.200 align:start position:0%
them charge less than the reimbursement
 
00:57:53.910 --> 00:57:53.920 align:start position:0%
amount for uh for a lunch so uh so this
 
00:57:56.750 --> 00:57:56.760 align:start position:0%
becomes a a net positive for them and
 
00:57:58.230 --> 00:57:58.240 align:start position:0%
then the fifth thing that we didn't talk
 
00:58:00.549 --> 00:58:00.559 align:start position:0%
about the representative fellows um
 
00:58:02.390 --> 00:58:02.400 align:start position:0%
mentioned when um when we were just
 
00:58:05.470 --> 00:58:05.480 align:start position:0%
meeting is how Ida actually uses free
 
00:58:08.309 --> 00:58:08.319 align:start position:0%
and reduced price lunch counts to um to
 
00:58:11.670 --> 00:58:11.680 align:start position:0%
help um to help calculate the title One
 
00:58:14.390 --> 00:58:14.400 align:start position:0%
funds that our that our schools uh
 
00:58:16.670 --> 00:58:16.680 align:start position:0%
receive so if that's kicking the can
 
00:58:18.750 --> 00:58:18.760 align:start position:0%
down the road I think what what I'm
 
00:58:21.630 --> 00:58:21.640 align:start position:0%
hearing uh from the other side is uh is
 
00:58:24.349 --> 00:58:24.359 align:start position:0%
kicking the can down the road further
 
00:58:27.390 --> 00:58:27.400 align:start position:0%
discussion represent Damon
 
00:58:30.710 --> 00:58:30.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I Echo everything
 
00:58:33.109 --> 00:58:33.119 align:start position:0%
representative luno said vigorously I
 
00:58:35.150 --> 00:58:35.160 align:start position:0%
would also point out that it is not
 
00:58:37.270 --> 00:58:37.280 align:start position:0%
fiscally responsible to do this because
 
00:58:39.270 --> 00:58:39.280 align:start position:0%
children with food insecurity are twice
 
00:58:41.589 --> 00:58:41.599 align:start position:0%
as likely to receive special ed services
 
00:58:43.789 --> 00:58:43.799 align:start position:0%
twice as likely to retweet a grade have
 
00:58:45.950 --> 00:58:45.960 align:start position:0%
increased hyperactivity and difficulty
 
00:58:48.069 --> 00:58:48.079 align:start position:0%
focusing and they're twice as likely to
 
00:58:49.589 --> 00:58:49.599 align:start position:0%
have behavioral issues that lead to
 
00:58:53.230 --> 00:58:53.240 align:start position:0%
suspension so they cost more money when
 
00:58:54.870 --> 00:58:54.880 align:start position:0%
they're not
 
00:58:57.829 --> 00:58:57.839 align:start position:0%
fed it's it's unconscionable that we
 
00:58:59.150 --> 00:58:59.160 align:start position:0%
can't figure out a way to go forward
 
00:59:01.950 --> 00:59:01.960 align:start position:0%
with this further discussion from the
 
00:59:04.670 --> 00:59:04.680 align:start position:0%

00:59:06.870 --> 00:59:06.880 align:start position:0%
CL or representative spills I I would
 
00:59:09.670 --> 00:59:09.680 align:start position:0%

bill which uh provides online
 
01:01:33.910 --> 01:01:33.920 align:start position:0%
application for participation in the
 
01:01:37.109 --> 01:01:37.119 align:start position:0%
free and reges program I know uh my
 
01:01:38.990 --> 01:01:39.000 align:start position:0%
school district is doing this at at
 
01:01:41.750 --> 01:01:41.760 align:start position:0%
currently uh without uh the need for the
 
01:01:43.870 --> 01:01:43.880 align:start position:0%
legislation I know others in the state
 
01:01:47.270 --> 01:01:47.280 align:start position:0%
are doing the same uh so uh if a school
 
01:01:49.109 --> 01:01:49.119 align:start position:0%
district desires to put an online
 
01:01:51.230 --> 01:01:51.240 align:start position:0%
application out for participation in and
 
01:01:53.630 --> 01:01:53.640 align:start position:0%
reduced price meal program they they can
 
01:01:55.190 --> 01:01:55.200 align:start position:0%
do so without the need for this
 
01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:57.789 align:start position:0%
do so without the need for this
legislation

01:01:57.789 --> 01:01:57.799 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:02:01.069 --> 01:02:01.079 align:start position:0%
any further discussion representative
 
01:02:04.150 --> 01:02:04.160 align:start position:0%
Weinstein um thank you Mr chair for uh
 
01:02:07.589 --> 01:02:07.599 align:start position:0%
taking my question or my my comment um I
 
01:02:10.910 --> 01:02:10.920 align:start position:0%
did put an amendment in it's not ready
 
01:02:15.990 --> 01:02:16.000 align:start position:0%
yet um that would change the program um
 
01:02:18.950 --> 01:02:18.960 align:start position:0%
removing the Mandate and making it a
 
01:02:23.230 --> 01:02:23.240 align:start position:0%
grant program for districts to to be
 
01:02:25.230 --> 01:02:25.240 align:start position:0%
reimbursed for the initial costs so I
 
01:02:26.470 --> 01:02:26.480 align:start position:0%
heard from the
 
01:02:28.510 --> 01:02:28.520 align:start position:0%
um business administrator in New Market
 
01:02:30.829 --> 01:02:30.839 align:start position:0%
and the the cost for new market and it
 
01:02:32.829 --> 01:02:32.839 align:start position:0%
varies widely throughout the state
 
01:02:36.950 --> 01:02:36.960 align:start position:0%
because it depends on the on their um uh
 
01:02:39.390 --> 01:02:39.400 align:start position:0%
platform that they use um so the cost in
 
01:02:41.349 --> 01:02:41.359 align:start position:0%
New Market was about
 
01:02:46.069 --> 01:02:46.079 align:start position:0%
$3,500 um and and then obviously with a
 
01:02:52.069 --> 01:02:52.079 align:start position:0%
a additional annual uh costs for for the
 
01:02:57.430 --> 01:02:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:59.589 --> 01:02:59.599 align:start position:0%
process I'm not really sure what it is
 
01:03:03.870 --> 01:03:03.880 align:start position:0%
um annual fee thank you um so um so at
 
01:03:05.829 --> 01:03:05.839 align:start position:0%
this point in time there is a motion if
 
01:03:07.230 --> 01:03:07.240 align:start position:0%
this is voted down then you can bring

I brought forward last week um excuse me
 
01:08:42.510 --> 01:08:42.520 align:start position:0%
and what it does is remove as the prior
 
01:08:44.950 --> 01:08:44.960 align:start position:0%
Amendment did the section of the bill
 
01:08:46.510 --> 01:08:46.520 align:start position:0%
wherein the Department of Education
 
01:08:48.189 --> 01:08:48.199 align:start position:0%

off school district meal debt and

22 of the original bill which is Clause
 
01:09:13.149 --> 01:09:13.159 align:start position:0%
F pertaining to collections of school me
 
01:09:18.309 --> 01:09:18.319 align:start position:0%

01:09:21.910 --> 01:09:21.920 align:start position:0%
require a policy statement by school
 
01:09:24.910 --> 01:09:24.920 align:start position:0%

bullying students who have unpaid meal
 
01:09:33.470 --> 01:09:33.480 align:start position:0%

01:09:38.110 --> 01:09:38.120 align:start position:0%
alleviate School Meal debt if that were

to be offered to them um there's no cost
 
01:09:46.590 --> 01:09:46.600 align:start position:0%

speak to your
 
01:10:53.229 --> 01:10:53.239 align:start position:0%
motion thank you chairman I was uh urged
 
01:10:56.590 --> 01:10:56.600 align:start position:0%
by constituencies not to and the ability
 
01:10:58.390 --> 01:10:58.400 align:start position:0%
for them to collect on student lunch
 
01:11:00.950 --> 01:11:00.960 align:start position:0%
programs um it is a self-funded program
 
01:11:03.630 --> 01:11:03.640 align:start position:0%
and this year our district it ran a
 
01:11:05.669 --> 01:11:05.679 align:start position:0%
deficit there and many of the voters at
 
01:11:07.830 --> 01:11:07.840 align:start position:0%
the school deliberative session were
 
01:11:11.390 --> 01:11:11.400 align:start position:0%
there to to um talk about their
 
01:11:13.750 --> 01:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
displeasure on us subsidizing it in that
 
01:11:17.070 --> 01:11:17.080 align:start position:0%
way so I'm just following along with my
 
01:11:19.950 --> 01:11:19.960 align:start position:0%
constituents and making motion to
 
01:11:24.030 --> 01:11:24.040 align:start position:0%
itl represent McGuire do you have sure
 
01:11:27.390 --> 01:11:27.400 align:start position:0%
um I I think that school districts
 
01:11:29.590 --> 01:11:29.600 align:start position:0%
should they want to have the policy
 
01:11:32.110 --> 01:11:32.120 align:start position:0%
that's in this amendment there's nothing
 
01:11:35.189 --> 01:11:35.199 align:start position:0%
that prevents them from doing so right
 
01:11:38.870 --> 01:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
so they have the they have the ability
 
01:11:41.669 --> 01:11:41.679 align:start position:0%
if they want to adopt um the policy of
 
01:11:45.470 --> 01:11:45.480 align:start position:0%
of not collecting in this way um they
 
01:11:46.990 --> 01:11:47.000 align:start position:0%
can do
 
01:11:49.390 --> 01:11:49.400 align:start position:0%

clarification
 
01:12:01.149 --> 01:12:01.159 align:start position:0%
so I may be misunderstanding what you
 
01:12:01.159 --> 01:12:01.870 align:start position:0%
so I may be misunderstanding what you
just

01:12:01.870 --> 01:12:01.880 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:12:04.910 --> 01:12:04.920 align:start position:0%
said the amendment
 
01:12:07.910 --> 01:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
removes the Clause prohibiting using a
 
01:12:09.669 --> 01:12:09.679 align:start position:0%
collections agency are you indicating
 
01:12:10.590 --> 01:12:10.600 align:start position:0%
that your
 
01:12:13.590 --> 01:12:13.600 align:start position:0%
constituents would prefer that Clause
 
01:12:18.550 --> 01:12:18.560 align:start position:0%
remain there or I'm I'm puzzled so I was
 
01:12:21.470 --> 01:12:21.480 align:start position:0%
asked not to approve this bill because
 
01:12:22.910 --> 01:12:22.920 align:start position:0%
they need to have every tool in their
 
01:12:25.270 --> 01:12:25.280 align:start position:0%
toolbox in order to keep their program
 
01:12:27.270 --> 01:12:27.280 align:start position:0%
running efficiently if they need to
 
01:12:29.950 --> 01:12:29.960 align:start position:0%
collect money they they need to collect
 
01:12:37.310 --> 01:12:37.320 align:start position:0%
that may I respond yes so the original
 
01:12:39.950 --> 01:12:39.960 align:start position:0%
bill would not be responsive to what
 
01:12:42.310 --> 01:12:42.320 align:start position:0%
your constituents requested because it
 
01:12:45.070 --> 01:12:45.080 align:start position:0%
did does have a clause prohibiting using
 
01:12:46.830 --> 01:12:46.840 align:start position:0%
a collections agency the amendment
 
01:12:46.840 --> 01:12:48.550 align:start position:0%
a collections agency the amendment
removes

01:12:48.550 --> 01:12:48.560 align:start position:0%
removes
 
01:12:52.510 --> 01:12:52.520 align:start position:0%
that so A School District would be fully
 
01:12:54.709 --> 01:12:54.719 align:start position:0%
able to contract with a collection
 
01:12:56.870 --> 01:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
agency should they choose to do
 
01:13:01.430 --> 01:13:01.440 align:start position:0%
so if the amendment were put
 
01:13:05.030 --> 01:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
forward and we would be ensuring that
 
01:13:07.470 --> 01:13:07.480 align:start position:0%
every school district not just the ones
 
01:13:09.470 --> 01:13:09.480 align:start position:0%
that are Forward Thinking enough to
 
01:13:11.910 --> 01:13:11.920 align:start position:0%
create this policy but every school
 
01:13:14.950 --> 01:13:14.960 align:start position:0%
district would be kind to poor children
 
01:13:18.270 --> 01:13:18.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:21.430 --> 01:13:21.440 align:start position:0%
debt further discussion representative
 
01:13:25.669 --> 01:13:25.679 align:start position:0%
Kon thank you Mr chair yes I'm still
 
01:13:28.950 --> 01:13:28.960 align:start position:0%
um it's still a no deal for me on uh
 
01:13:30.750 --> 01:13:30.760 align:start position:0%
item number G which authorizes the
 
01:13:32.709 --> 01:13:32.719 align:start position:0%
school to complete applications for
 
01:13:34.669 --> 01:13:34.679 align:start position:0%
students I think this this is a data
 
01:13:37.430 --> 01:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
privacy issue and for that re reason I'm
 
01:13:39.990 --> 01:13:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:43.189 --> 01:13:43.199 align:start position:0%
itl yes represent
 
01:13:45.709 --> 01:13:45.719 align:start position:0%
Damon in response to representative
 
01:13:47.990 --> 01:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
Cam's statement that is a federal
 
01:13:51.189 --> 01:13:51.199 align:start position:0%
statute with it's just stating it here
 
01:13:54.669 --> 01:13:54.679 align:start position:0%
as part of this policy it's not new it's
 
01:13:54.679 --> 01:13:55.550 align:start position:0%
as part of this policy it's not new it's
not

01:13:55.550 --> 01:13:55.560 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:13:57.990 --> 01:13:58.000 align:start position:0%
um we we can't not do that unless the
 
01:14:00.830 --> 01:14:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:03.790 --> 01:14:03.800 align:start position:0%
changes for represent luno thank you
 
01:14:06.149 --> 01:14:06.159 align:start position:0%
very much Mr chair and and also I mean
 
01:14:08.270 --> 01:14:08.280 align:start position:0%
when it when when we make statements
 
01:14:10.510 --> 01:14:10.520 align:start position:0%
like like well school districts can
 
01:14:12.669 --> 01:14:12.679 align:start position:0%
already adopt a policy should they want
 
01:14:14.750 --> 01:14:14.760 align:start position:0%
to well I guess that would apply for all
 
01:14:16.950 --> 01:14:16.960 align:start position:0%
School District policies however the
 
01:14:20.709 --> 01:14:20.719 align:start position:0%
general court by law actually laws that
 
01:14:23.390 --> 01:14:23.400 align:start position:0%
we've created I think require school
 
01:14:25.709 --> 01:14:25.719 align:start position:0%
districts to adopt certain policies in
 
01:14:27.350 --> 01:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
certain areas that's actually come out
 
01:14:29.910 --> 01:14:29.920 align:start position:0%
of this um well out of the the former
 
01:14:32.950 --> 01:14:32.960 align:start position:0%
House Education committee so where where
 
01:14:35.870 --> 01:14:35.880 align:start position:0%
where the legislature feels feels maybe
 
01:14:39.390 --> 01:14:39.400 align:start position:0%
um um something is so important and in
 
01:14:41.709 --> 01:14:41.719 align:start position:0%
this case um you know it could be looked
 
01:14:44.669 --> 01:14:44.679 align:start position:0%
at as as victim shaming students or
 
01:14:49.110 --> 01:14:49.120 align:start position:0%
shaming students then then then what why
 
01:14:54.310 --> 01:14:54.320 align:start position:0%
shouldn't the legislature uh adopt um uh
 
01:14:58.030 --> 01:14:58.040 align:start position:0%
a law this bill to um to require school
 
01:15:00.590 --> 01:15:00.600 align:start position:0%
districts to uh to not shame students
 
01:15:03.430 --> 01:15:03.440 align:start position:0%
over um over meal debt uh we do it in a
 
01:15:04.870 --> 01:15:04.880 align:start position:0%
lot of other areas and I think this is
 
01:15:06.390 --> 01:15:06.400 align:start position:0%
an appropriate area
 
01:15:11.310 --> 01:15:11.320 align:start position:0%
too further discussion representer
 
01:15:14.390 --> 01:15:14.400 align:start position:0%
Damon I would like to ask my colleagues
 
01:15:16.270 --> 01:15:16.280 align:start position:0%
who are opposed to this
 
01:15:25.149 --> 01:15:25.159 align:start position:0%
bill if they believe that a b c d or e
 
01:15:27.070 --> 01:15:27.080 align:start position:0%
are actually acceptable things for
 
01:15:31.110 --> 01:15:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:33.709 --> 01:15:33.719 align:start position:0%

01:15:45.950 --> 01:15:45.960 align:start position:0%
watching the ladies in the lunchroom who
 
01:15:49.149 --> 01:15:49.159 align:start position:0%
knew the children by name speak to each
 
01:15:51.070 --> 01:15:51.080 align:start position:0%
of them by name with a care I know the
 
01:15:53.030 --> 01:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
administrators have for each of the kids
 
01:15:55.390 --> 01:15:55.400 align:start position:0%
in that school they don't need to told
 
01:15:57.070 --> 01:15:57.080 align:start position:0%
how to treat each kid and each one is
 
01:15:59.470 --> 01:15:59.480 align:start position:0%
treated individually shaming you don't
 
01:16:01.270 --> 01:16:01.280 align:start position:0%
need to tell a teacher not to shame

speak to this um when I introduced this
 
01:18:35.470 --> 01:18:35.480 align:start position:0%
this motion for or the bill for the
 
01:18:39.430 --> 01:18:39.440 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor and those on it uh I I had
 
01:18:41.669 --> 01:18:41.679 align:start position:0%
mentioned that this is an opportunity
 
01:18:43.510 --> 01:18:43.520 align:start position:0%
and this bill is much different than
 
01:18:46.430 --> 01:18:46.440 align:start position:0%
manifest education hardship much much
 
01:18:49.070 --> 01:18:49.080 align:start position:0%
different this bill gives the parent the
 
01:18:52.910 --> 01:18:52.920 align:start position:0%
right in a sending school to have their
 
01:18:55.709 --> 01:18:55.719 align:start position:0%
child go to another school nearby
 
01:18:57.149 --> 01:18:57.159 align:start position:0%
whether it be a public school in the
 
01:18:59.310 --> 01:18:59.320 align:start position:0%
district or outside the district which
 
01:19:02.229 --> 01:19:02.239 align:start position:0%
is an open enrollment school and it
 
01:19:05.310 --> 01:19:05.320 align:start position:0%
provides the opportunity for parents to
 
01:19:06.709 --> 01:19:06.719 align:start position:0%
take the advantage of the Open
 
01:19:08.669 --> 01:19:08.679 align:start position:0%
Enrollment school which might have a
 
01:19:11.149 --> 01:19:11.159 align:start position:0%
program of studies or a curriculum which
 
01:19:12.910 --> 01:19:12.920 align:start position:0%
is more appropriate for their child that
 
01:19:15.510 --> 01:19:15.520 align:start position:0%
they may see uh in the interest of the
 
01:19:17.270 --> 01:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
child in the in the best interest of the
 
01:19:20.149 --> 01:19:20.159 align:start position:0%
child and it's responsibility of the
 
01:19:21.950 --> 01:19:21.960 align:start position:0%
sending District to place in their
 
01:19:25.590 --> 01:19:25.600 align:start position:0%
budget the revenues for this and the
 
01:19:27.990 --> 01:19:28.000 align:start position:0%
sending school does not need to be an
 
01:19:30.350 --> 01:19:30.360 align:start position:0%
open enrollment School the receiving
 
01:19:32.990 --> 01:19:33.000 align:start position:0%
school is the Open Enrollment school
 
01:19:34.990 --> 01:19:35.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very
 
01:19:39.950 --> 01:19:39.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:42.590 --> 01:19:42.600 align:start position:0%
comments yes representative luno yeah
 
01:19:45.629 --> 01:19:45.639 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much so um so
 
01:19:48.470 --> 01:19:48.480 align:start position:0%
you know we just talked about um what
 
01:19:51.229 --> 01:19:51.239 align:start position:0%
districts can can do on their own uh or
 
01:19:53.870 --> 01:19:53.880 align:start position:0%
what they can't do on their own and um
 
01:19:55.870 --> 01:19:55.880 align:start position:0%
and one of the things this bill seems to
 
01:19:57.870 --> 01:19:57.880 align:start position:0%
require is school districts to establish
 
01:20:00.830 --> 01:20:00.840 align:start position:0%
a line item in their operating budget um
 
01:20:02.910 --> 01:20:02.920 align:start position:0%
to reflect expenditures for open
 
01:20:06.990 --> 01:20:07.000 align:start position:0%
enrollment schools so could um does
 
01:20:11.790 --> 01:20:11.800 align:start position:0%
that then require school districts to um
 
01:20:16.950 --> 01:20:16.960 align:start position:0%
to have to raise public tax money to to
 
01:20:18.510 --> 01:20:18.520 align:start position:0%
be sent
 
01:20:21.310 --> 01:20:21.320 align:start position:0%
to outside of the districts if somebody
 
01:20:26.149 --> 01:20:26.159 align:start position:0%
wants to attend uh a different school I
 
01:20:27.750 --> 01:20:27.760 align:start position:0%
mean what what are we what what are we
 
01:20:31.669 --> 01:20:31.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:34.110 --> 01:20:34.120 align:start position:0%
line we're asking the taxpayers to
 
01:20:35.669 --> 01:20:35.679 align:start position:0%
appropriate dollars to the education of
 
01:20:38.270 --> 01:20:38.280 align:start position:0%
a child and whether the the dollars are
 
01:20:40.270 --> 01:20:40.280 align:start position:0%
better used in a receiving school which
 
01:20:42.550 --> 01:20:42.560 align:start position:0%
is an open enrollment school that ta
 
01:20:46.669 --> 01:20:46.679 align:start position:0%
taxpayer dollar goes over 80% goes over
 
01:20:48.149 --> 01:20:48.159 align:start position:0%
the other school and and the sending
 
01:20:50.669 --> 01:20:50.679 align:start position:0%
School keeps the 20% so I I think it's a
 
01:20:52.510 --> 01:20:52.520 align:start position:0%
a win-win for everybody and especially
 
01:20:53.990 --> 01:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
the child who gets the education they
 
01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:59.189 align:start position:0%
the child who gets the education they
need

01:20:59.189 --> 01:20:59.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:03.350 --> 01:21:03.360 align:start position:0%

186-16 C uh addresses rues succeeding
 
01:23:18.270 --> 01:23:18.280 align:start position:0%
state or federal minimum requirements
 
01:23:20.590 --> 01:23:20.600 align:start position:0%
that's in rule in law right now whenever
 
01:23:22.550 --> 01:23:22.560 align:start position:0%
the State Board of Education proposes to
 
01:23:24.790 --> 01:23:24.800 align:start position:0%
adopt or amend any special education
 
01:23:27.070 --> 01:23:27.080 align:start position:0%
rule which exceeds the minimum
 
01:23:29.629 --> 01:23:29.639 align:start position:0%
requirements of state or federal law the
 
01:23:32.189 --> 01:23:32.199 align:start position:0%
State Board shall in addition to the
 
01:23:36.910 --> 01:23:36.920 align:start position:0%
provisions of RSA 541a issue a report of
 
01:23:39.189 --> 01:23:39.199 align:start position:0%
all such proposed rules which meets the
 
01:23:41.470 --> 01:23:41.480 align:start position:0%
following requirements so that's already
 
01:23:44.750 --> 01:23:44.760 align:start position:0%
in statute and the statute requires in
 
01:23:47.149 --> 01:23:47.159 align:start position:0%
this report the annual report one the
 
01:23:50.350 --> 01:23:50.360 align:start position:0%
rule number be stated number two the
 
01:23:53.830 --> 01:23:53.840 align:start position:0%
nature of the rule must be stated number
 
01:23:56.229 --> 01:23:56.239 align:start position:0%
three any any state minimum requirement
 
01:23:59.430 --> 01:23:59.440 align:start position:0%
exceeded must be stated number four any
 
01:24:01.510 --> 01:24:01.520 align:start position:0%
federal minimum requirement exceeded
 
01:24:02.550 --> 01:24:02.560 align:start position:0%
must be
 
01:24:06.030 --> 01:24:06.040 align:start position:0%
stated and and the next the reasons for
 
01:24:07.709 --> 01:24:07.719 align:start position:0%
exceeding those minimum requirements
 
01:24:10.870 --> 01:24:10.880 align:start position:0%
must also be stated what this bill does
 
01:24:14.470 --> 01:24:14.480 align:start position:0%
it simply adds in as a sixth requirement
 
01:24:16.910 --> 01:24:16.920 align:start position:0%
the following the unfunded Financial
 
01:24:19.510 --> 01:24:19.520 align:start position:0%
impact on local school districts for
 
01:24:22.270 --> 01:24:22.280 align:start position:0%
rules exceeding state or federal minimum
 
01:24:24.470 --> 01:24:24.480 align:start position:0%
requirements so what this require re
 
01:24:27.189 --> 01:24:27.199 align:start position:0%
Ires that this report also entail or
 
01:24:30.390 --> 01:24:30.400 align:start position:0%
incorporate unfinancial impact unfunded
 
01:24:32.629 --> 01:24:32.639 align:start position:0%
Financial impacts on the local school
 
01:24:35.390 --> 01:24:35.400 align:start position:0%
district so that total would be there
 
01:24:38.030 --> 01:24:38.040 align:start position:0%
and uh I believe this is necessary for
 
01:24:40.709 --> 01:24:40.719 align:start position:0%
us to realize how what is going on in
 
01:24:44.629 --> 01:24:44.639 align:start position:0%
terms of our exceeding uh I recognize
 
01:24:47.550 --> 01:24:47.560 align:start position:0%
there's places where we do exceed for
 
01:24:49.470 --> 01:24:49.480 align:start position:0%
good reason some areas of special
 
01:24:51.750 --> 01:24:51.760 align:start position:0%
education however there's other areas
 
01:24:54.390 --> 01:24:54.400 align:start position:0%
which I quite frankly think that we need
 
01:24:57.750 --> 01:24:57.760 align:start position:0%
be more cognizant of and and understand
 
01:25:00.950 --> 01:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
and and this is the way we will uh find
 
01:25:03.669 --> 01:25:03.679 align:start position:0%
out that'll be it'll be placed in the
 
01:25:05.189 --> 01:25:05.199 align:start position:0%
annual report which is given to the
 
01:25:09.390 --> 01:25:09.400 align:start position:0%
state board and and to us thank
 
01:25:13.390 --> 01:25:13.400 align:start position:0%
you further yes representative
 
01:25:15.109 --> 01:25:15.119 align:start position:0%
Damon thank
 
01:25:17.750 --> 01:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
you I'm concerned that a bill that is
 
01:25:21.870 --> 01:25:21.880 align:start position:0%
about financial impact of rules doesn't
 
01:25:23.870 --> 01:25:23.880 align:start position:0%
have a fiscal node in regards to the
 
01:25:26.830 --> 01:25:26.840 align:start position:0%
cost of assessing and doing the work of
 
01:25:26.840 --> 01:25:27.590 align:start position:0%
cost of assessing and doing the work of
this

01:25:27.590 --> 01:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:25:31.470 --> 01:25:31.480 align:start position:0%
bill and I'm concerned that there are
 
01:25:34.229 --> 01:25:34.239 align:start position:0%
very likely to be consequences that
 
01:25:37.030 --> 01:25:37.040 align:start position:0%
result in lessening the standards that
 
01:25:40.270 --> 01:25:40.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire takes pride in for
 
01:25:43.390 --> 01:25:43.400 align:start position:0%
our better than the federal minimum
 
01:25:47.109 --> 01:25:47.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:50.030 --> 01:25:50.040 align:start position:0%
opposed representative luno yeah thank
 
01:25:52.189 --> 01:25:52.199 align:start position:0%
you very much Mr chair yeah I'm opposed
 
01:25:56.550 --> 01:25:56.560 align:start position:0%
to um to 718 as well and uh well I think
 
01:26:00.070 --> 01:26:00.080 align:start position:0%
on the um on it on its face you know
 
01:26:03.550 --> 01:26:03.560 align:start position:0%
understanding which um which rules are
 
01:26:07.430 --> 01:26:07.440 align:start position:0%
uh are unfunded um mandates
 
01:26:11.310 --> 01:26:11.320 align:start position:0%
and goes goes beyond just identifying
 
01:26:14.550 --> 01:26:14.560 align:start position:0%
the um the the rules that that exceed
 
01:26:18.470 --> 01:26:18.480 align:start position:0%
state and federal um uh federal law so
 
01:26:20.350 --> 01:26:20.360 align:start position:0%
in this case we're identifying the ones
 
01:26:22.910 --> 01:26:22.920 align:start position:0%
that are unfunded by the state but are
 
01:26:25.510 --> 01:26:25.520 align:start position:0%
actually funded by the um by our local
 
01:26:29.629 --> 01:26:29.639 align:start position:0%
property taxpayers and and I think one
 
01:26:31.990 --> 01:26:32.000 align:start position:0%
of the one of the things that that that
 
01:26:35.990 --> 01:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
really jumps off the page to me is that
 
01:26:37.790 --> 01:26:37.800 align:start position:0%
uh is that this puts us on a slippery
 
01:26:40.709 --> 01:26:40.719 align:start position:0%
slope to low standards and no standards
 
01:26:42.229 --> 01:26:42.239 align:start position:0%
which apparently which I think has been
 
01:26:44.270 --> 01:26:44.280 align:start position:0%
a Hallmark of our Department of
 
01:26:47.270 --> 01:26:47.280 align:start position:0%
Education despite the um the the fact
 
01:26:48.950 --> 01:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
that our Public Schools perform among
 
01:26:50.590 --> 01:26:50.600 align:start position:0%
the best in the
 
01:26:53.229 --> 01:26:53.239 align:start position:0%
country representative P
 
01:26:56.189 --> 01:26:56.199 align:start position:0%
Miller thank you Mr chair um I just
 
01:26:58.070 --> 01:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
wanted to State on the record that I do
 
01:27:00.669 --> 01:27:00.679 align:start position:0%
not share the concern expressed by my
 
01:27:04.590 --> 01:27:04.600 align:start position:0%
colleague that reporting on the cost of
 
01:27:06.790 --> 01:27:06.800 align:start position:0%
the rules that we adopt will somehow
 
01:27:09.910 --> 01:27:09.920 align:start position:0%
lead to changes to the worse because I
 
01:27:12.310 --> 01:27:12.320 align:start position:0%
think it is the duty of the legislature
 
01:27:14.910 --> 01:27:14.920 align:start position:0%
to examine the consequences of its
 
01:27:17.709 --> 01:27:17.719 align:start position:0%
actions when we pass laws or when we
 
01:27:20.430 --> 01:27:20.440 align:start position:0%
approve rules we should look at their
 
01:27:22.470 --> 01:27:22.480 align:start position:0%
costs and we should always keep an eye
 
01:27:24.830 --> 01:27:24.840 align:start position:0%
towards whether the benefit achieved
 
01:27:27.109 --> 01:27:27.119 align:start position:0%
through those rules are worth the cost
 
01:27:29.590 --> 01:27:29.600 align:start position:0%
so this does nothing more than help us
 
01:27:32.669 --> 01:27:32.679 align:start position:0%
do our job better and for that reason I
 
01:27:34.950 --> 01:27:34.960 align:start position:0%
do not share those expressed concerns
 
01:27:39.590 --> 01:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you are there further
 
01:27:42.510 --> 01:27:42.520 align:start position:0%

huge service learning programs at my

01:31:40.149 --> 01:31:40.159 align:start position:0%
their grade point average went up
 
01:31:42.270 --> 01:31:42.280 align:start position:0%
1.0 after they had been out in the
 
01:31:44.990 --> 01:31:45.000 align:start position:0%
communities doing community service
